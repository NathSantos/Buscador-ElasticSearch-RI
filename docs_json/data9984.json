In the archipelagos of Macaronesia (NE Atlantic), limpets have been \n\nextensively exploited probably since islands were first colonized. This has led to profound \n\nconsequences in the dynamics of rocky shore communities. The specific objectives of this thesis were \n\nto: 1) develop and characterize species-specific microsatellite markers for the limpets Patella candei \n\n(d\u2019Orbigny 1840) and Patella aspera (R\u00f6ding 1798), endemic to the Macaronesia archipelagos; 2) \n\nassess their genetic diversity, population structure and contemporary levels of connectivity throughout \n\nMacaronesia; 3) conduct a morphometric analysis of the P. candei complex to complement molecular \n\ndata; 4) evaluate the temporal and spatial variation in recruitment of P. candei and study its \n\nassociation with real-time environmental data; 5) assess the effect of temperature on larval \n\ndevelopment of P. candei; and 6) provide general recommendations to foster the sustainable \n\nexploitation of limpets in Macaronesia. A total of twelve and seventeen microsatellite markers were \n\ndescribed for P. candei and P. aspera, respectively. These showed clean polymorphisms and species-\n\nspecific markers were combined in three optimized multiplex reactions. For P. candei, a highly \n\nsignificant genetic break between archipelagos following isolation by distance was detected. \n\nContrastingly, significant genetic differentiation among islands (i.e. Azores) was absent possibly \n\nindicating ongoing gene flow via larval exchange between populations. Significant shell shape \n\ndifferences among archipelagos were also detected using both distance-based and geometric \n\nmorphometric analyses. Adaptive processes associated with niche differentiation and strong barriers \n\nto gene flow among archipelagos may be the mechanisms underlying P. candei diversification in \n\nMacaronesia. As for P. aspera, genetic analyses showed significant population structure between \n\npopulations from Azores and populations from Madeira and Canaries, and absence of current or \n\nhistoric gene flow between these. Results also suggest that both population clusters have experienced \n\ndemographic changes over time. Heterozygote deficits were common across populations, which can \n\nbe better accounted for by inbreeding than by null alleles or Wahlund effect. Such levels of inbreeding \n\nare likely a consequence of a significant reduction of reproductive units due to decades of intense \n\nexploitation. The monitoring program applied to track P. candei recruitment showed that early recruits \n\noccurred throughout the entire duration of the program, but its intensity varied in space and time. In \n\ngeneral, a marked peak in recruitment occurred during winter/spring months, the period of greatest \n\nreproductive activity, when sea surface temperatures are lower and wave turbulence higher. \n\nSignificant wave height was probably the most important proximate cue triggering the recruitment of P. \n\ncandei, which eventually depends on adequate ultimate drivers for spawning and reproduction (i.e. \n\ntemperature). Indeed, as a winter-breeder, P. candei larvae seem to perform better and attain higher \n\nfitness at colder temperatures. In fact, experimental treatments on larval rearing showed that larval \n\ndevelopment was faster at increasing temperatures but cumulative survivorship decreased; about 25% \n\nof larvae at higher temperatures survived to the end of the experiment, a 2-fold decrease from the \n\naverage survivorship of ~ 50% at lower temperatures. Overall, the outcomes of this thesis fill a gap in \n\nour knowledge about processes involved in determining the connectivity patterns between limpet \n\npopulations and the environmental factors influencing such patterns across the Macaronesia region. \n\n\n\n\t viii \n\nThe present study is an important first step in this direction of using multi-faceted approaches to \n\nunderstand complex processes operating at the marine environment, while providing a fundamental \n\nasset to define stocks and thus inform specific conservation strategies that foster the sustainable \n\nexploitation of limpets throughout Macaronesia archipelagos.  \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS: Patella, limpets, Macaronesia, population structure, connectivity, resilience \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t ix \n\nRESUMO  \n\nA explora\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos naturais biol\u00f3gicos para o consumo humano tem provocado altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ngraves no equil\u00edbrio dos ecossistemas. Nos arquip\u00e9lagos da Macaron\u00e9sia (NE Atl\u00e2ntico), as lapas \n\nt\u00eam sido extensivamente exploradas, provavelmente desde que as ilhas foram colonizadas. Isso \n\nlevou a profundas consequ\u00eancias na din\u00e2mica das comunidades litorais. Os objetivos espec\u00edficos \n\ndesta tese foram: 1) desenvolver e caracterizar marcadores de microssat\u00e9lites espec\u00edficos para as \n\nesp\u00e9cies de lapas Patella candei (d\u2019Orbigny 1840) e Patella aspera (R\u00f6ding 1798); 2) avaliar a sua \n\ndiversidade gen\u00e9tica, estrutura populacional e conectividade na Macaron\u00e9sia; 3) realizar uma an\u00e1lise \n\nmorfom\u00e9trica do complexo de esp\u00e9cies P. candei para complementar os dados moleculares; 4) \n\navaliar a varia\u00e7\u00e3o temporal e espacial no recrutamento de P. candei e estudar sua associa\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\ndados ambientais; 5) avaliar o efeito da temperatura no desenvolvimento larvar de P. candei; e 6) \n\nfornecer recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es gerais para promover a explora\u00e7\u00e3o sustent\u00e1vel de lapas na Macaron\u00e9sia. \n\nUm total de doze e dezassete marcadores de microssat\u00e9lites foram caracterizados para P. candei e \n\nP. aspera, respetivamente, e amplificados em rea\u00e7\u00f5es multiplex devidamente otimizadas. Para P. \n\ncandei, foi detetada uma diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica significativa entre os arquip\u00e9lagos. Ao inv\u00e9s, n\u00e3o se \n\nverificou diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o entre ilhas (isto \u00e9, A\u00e7ores), o que constitui provavelmente um sinal da \n\nexist\u00eancia de fluxo migrat\u00f3rio de indiv\u00edduos (larvas) entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es. Foram tamb\u00e9m detetadas \n\ndiferen\u00e7as significativas na forma da concha entre os arquip\u00e9lagos. Processos adaptativos \n\nassociados \u00e0 variabilidade de nichos e fortes barreiras ao fluxo gen\u00e9tico entre os arquip\u00e9lagos podem \n\nconstituir os mecanismos subjacentes \u00e0 diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o de P. candei na Macaron\u00e9sia. Quanto a P. \n\naspera, as an\u00e1lises gen\u00e9ticas mostraram uma diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o populacional entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es dos \n\nA\u00e7ores e as popula\u00e7\u00f5es da Madeira e Can\u00e1rias. Os resultados tamb\u00e9m sugerem que ambos os \n\ngrupos populacionais sofreram mudan\u00e7as demogr\u00e1ficas ao longo do tempo. Os d\u00e9fices \n\nheterozig\u00f3ticos revelaram-se comuns em todas as popula\u00e7\u00f5es, provavelmente uma consequ\u00eancia de \n\nprocessos endog\u00e2micos associados a uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o significativa dos indiv\u00edduos reprodutores, devido \n\na d\u00e9cadas de explora\u00e7\u00e3o intensa. O programa de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do recrutamento de P. candei \n\npermitiu verificar que surgem novos recrutas durante todo o ano, embora a sua abund\u00e2ncia varie no \n\nespa\u00e7o e no tempo. Em geral, um pico acentuado ocorre durante os meses de inverno/ primavera, \n\ncoincidente com o per\u00edodo de maior atividade reprodutora, no qual as temperaturas da superf\u00edcie da \n\n\u00e1gua do mar s\u00e3o baixas e \u00e9 maior a agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima. A par da temperatura (sobretudo pelo seu \n\npapel na atividade reprodutora), a altura significativa das ondas \u00e9 provavelmente o fator mais \n\nimportante a desencadear o recrutamento de P. candei. Por outro lado, os dados de desenvolvimento \n\nlarvar revelaram que o desenvolvimento \u00e9 mais acelerado a temperaturas superiores, mas a \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia acumulada diminuiu; cerca de 25% das larvas expostas a temperaturas mais elevadas \n\nsobreviveram at\u00e9 ao final da experi\u00eancia, sendo que cerca de metade das larvas sobreviveu a \n\ntemperaturas inferiores. Em geral, os resultados desta tese preenchem uma lacuna no conhecimento \n\nsobre os processos envolvidos na determina\u00e7\u00e3o dos padr\u00f5es de conectividade entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nlapas e os fatores ambientais que influenciam esses padr\u00f5es na regi\u00e3o da Macaron\u00e9sia. O presente \n\nestudo constitui um importante primeiro passo no uso de abordagens multidisciplinares para \n\ncompreender processos complexos que operam no meio marinho, proporcionando uma ferramenta \n\n\n\n\t x \n\nfundamental para definir stocks e assim propor estrat\u00e9gias de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edficas que \n\npromovam uma explora\u00e7\u00e3o sustent\u00e1vel de lapas em toda a Macaron\u00e9sia. \n\n \nPALAVRAS-CHAVE: Patella, lapas, Macaronesia, estrutura populacional, conectividade, resili\u00eancia\n\n  \n\n\n\n\t 3 \n\n\t\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\t 3 \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\nGeneral introduction \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nThere is growing consensus that anthropogenic activities are impacting the structure and functioning \n\nof marine ecosystems. For instance, over-fishing is known to have profound community-level effects \n\nparticularly when keystone species are targeted (Dur\u00e1n and Castilla 1989; McClanahan et al. 1996; \n\nOrensanz et al. 1998; Jackson et al. 2001; Ainley and Blight 2009; Smith et al. 2011). This is \n\nespecially relevant in oceanic archipelagos such as Macaronesia, which present unique habitats with \n\nfragile communities that are highly susceptible to degradation and ecosystem disruption (Hawkins et \n\nal. 2000). Potential factors contributing to such fragility include the generally low and stochastic nature \n\nof benthic recruitment in a dispersive island environment (Siegel et al. 2008) and the often frequent \n\nand pervasive nature of human resource exploitation. \n\nFor the last decades, perhaps centuries, rocky shore limpets have been heavily exploited throughout \n\nMacaronesia, and contemporary stocks are facing a continuous risk of overexploitation (Santos et al. \n\n1990, 1995; Morton et al. 1998; Hawkins et al. 2000; Martins et al. 2008). One of the greatest \n\nchallenges in fisheries research is the adequate delimitation and identification of such stocks (e.g. \n\nHawkins et al. 2016). Failure by fishery managers to account for stock complexity and composition \n\nmay lead to the depletion of particular components, with unknown ecological consequences \n\n(Stephenson 1999). Stock delimitation should be able to integrate data from multiple sources, and use \n\ngenetic as well as physical, biological and ecological information to identify the demographic \n\nprocesses involved in the population dynamics of a given exploited species. Genetic approaches can \n\ngive insights into the broad definition and extent of genomic admixture among management units, \n\nwhich are important in conservation efforts especially in overexploited species at risk of extinction. \n\nThese molecular tools can expand our ability to understand population demography, dynamics and \n\nstructure, while uncovering putative adaptive genetic differentiation among populations and/or species. \n\nPopulation genomics can thus provide vital information for fisheries management and species \n\nconservation, as it can potentially revolutionize the delineation of conservation units, as well as our \n\nunderstanding of the adaptive response of populations to rapid environmental changes and the \n\nevolutionary consequences of selective harvesting (Nielsen et al. 2009; Funk et al. 2012). On its own, \n\nhowever, genetic approaches may be insufficient to quantify true levels of demographic connectivity \n\nand the ecological effects of movement among populations of a given species (Turner et al. 2002; \n\nChapuis et al. 2011; Hawkins et al. 2016). Information on life history traits, such as reproduction, \n\ndevelopment, growth, transport and fate of planktonic larvae, settlement and recruitment, provides \n\nadditional insights into larval dispersal and ecological population connectivity, and hence, a more \n\naccurate understanding of population dynamics. \n\n\n\n\t 4 \n\nThis thesis addresses the population genetics and dynamics of two exploited species of limpets in \n\nMacaronesia in general and the Azores in particular. The overall aim is to delimit stock units to enable \n\nmanagement and conservation of these economically and culturally important species. In addition to \n\npopulation genomic approaches using next generation sequencing, basic biological and ecological \n\ninformation essential to understand connectivity and population dynamics has been collected. Below, I \n\nbriefly review the literature on marine dispersal and connectivity, recruitment in benthic invertebrates, \n\nthe use of molecular genetic tools to understand connectivity, and Macaronesian limpets, before \n\noutlining the overall aims and rationale of the thesis. \n\n \n\nDispersal, isolation and connectivity in marine organisms \n\nMany sessile marine organisms have a life-history cycle which includes a pelagic larval stage with \n\nhigh potential for dispersal (Cowen et al. 2000; Morgan 2001). This has driven researchers to accept \n\nthat marine populations can be regarded as open, meaning that their offspring are freely spreading \n\nand mixing over large geographical areas (Cowen et al. 2000). However, this traditional view has often \n\nbeen challenged by a number of studies who have reported far more restricted dispersal than \n\npreviously predicted, suggesting that a large proportion of larvae may be retained and do not take \n\nadvantage of their full putative potential for dispersal (Jones et al. 1999; Cowen et al. 2000; Mora and \n\nSale 2002; Swearer et al. 2002; Warner and Cowen 2002; Levin 2006; Cowen et al. 2006; Wood and \n\nGardner 2007; Gaines et al. 2007; Jenkins et al. 2007). Evidence of limited dispersal have been \n\nprovided by i) the use of novel molecular, genetic and geochemical techniques (Almany et al. 2007; \n\nBecker et al. 2007; Teske et al. 2011); ii) the recognition of the significance of many biological traits, \n\nsuch as larval behaviour and open-water mortality (Burton and Feldman 1982; Fisher 2005; Sanford et \n\nal. 2006); and iii) a better understanding of physical processes that restrict larval movement, such as \n\noceanographic dominant currents, eddies and upwelling systems (Thornhill et al. 2008; Galarza et al. \n\n2009). In fact, the connectivity and structuring of marine populations result from several biological (life \n\nhistory traits, larval behaviour), ecological (food availability, species interactions), and physical (past \n\nand present oceanographic and climatic features) processes (see Grantham et al. 2003). The interplay \n\nof these factors, acting across a range of spatial and temporal scales, has significant implications in \n\ndetermining the amount of gene flow and connectivity between usually patchily distributed marine \n\npopulations (Palumbi 1994; Cowen and Sponaugle 2009 and references therein). Occasionally, \n\npopulations may become isolated if factors negatively affecting dispersal are substantial in time and \n\nspace, with migration or dispersal becoming fully restricted. Under such scenario, isolated populations \n\nslowly differentiate and adapt to the point of reproductive isolation and new different species may be \n\ngenerated (Allendorf and Luikart 2007). \n\nOn top of all factors affecting dispersion, geographic distance between areas of suitable habitat can by \n\nitself promote population isolation such that no or only limited contact is possible between them (Avise \n\n2001). This is particularly important on oceanic islands, which provide a good example of isolation by \n\ndistance leading to speciation. Oceanic islands, by definition, have never been connected to any \n\nlandmass. All the species present on those islands colonized them via exceptional events of long \n\n\n\n\t 5 \n\ndistance dispersal, and then diverged from their mainland source populations, sometimes into new \n\nendemic species. Additionally, evidence suggests that self-recruitment increases with isolation and \n\nthat isolated islands will on average receive lowers levels of recruitment, owing to dispersive larval \n\nloss, than equivalent mainland sites (Cowen et al. 2000); this is notable even on islands close to \n\nmainland (e.g. Crisp and Southward 1958; Hawkins and Hiscock 1983). \n\nGiven the intrinsic difficulties of tracking marine particles in their natural environment, processes \n\naffecting larval dispersal and, hence, population connectivity, are still poorly understood (Swearer et \n\nal. 2002; Weersing and Toonen 2009). In fact, complex interactions between coastal geomorphology, \n\nocean currents and species life-history traits result in variable and complicated temporal and spatial \n\npatterns of larval dispersion and settlement (e.g. Lagos et al. 2008). For example, there is now \n\nmounting evidence that connectivity and gene exchange between populations can be fairly low, even \n\nin species that can freely disperse their offspring. For instance, gene flow was shown to be restricted \n\nfor species with (Semibalanus balanoides), but also without (Nucella lapillus) planktonic larval stages \n\n(Bell 2008). A meta-analysis study by Weersing and Toonen (2009) revealed that the capacity to \n\ndisperse (provided by the pelagic larval duration) does not predict the magnitude of gene flow and \n\ngeographic scale of population structure in marine systems. This suggests that, in many cases, larval \n\nexchange is restricted despite the inherent potential to disperse (Hedgecock 1986). Low levels of \n\nlarval exchange may thus limit the success of any protected area and may prevent multiple \n\nconservation objectives from being achieved (Cowen et al. 2006). Understanding the scale at which \n\npopulations are connected is therefore a fundamental aspect to consider in biodiversity conservation, \n\nstock delimitation, fishery management, and the spatial design of marine protected areas. Indeed, \n\nmany theoretical studies suggest that population connectivity plays a fundamental role in local and \n\nmetapopulation dynamics, community dynamics and structure, genetic diversity, and the resiliency of \n\npopulations to human exploitation (for overviews see Hansson 1991; Hastings and Harrison 1994; \n\nBotsford et al. 2009). \n\n \n\nRecruitment in benthic marine macroinvertebrates \n\nRecruitment variability remains one of the most striking features of the dynamics of many marine fish \n\n(e.g. Hjort 1914; Lasker 1981; Cushing 1990) and invertebrate populations (e.g. Bowman and Lewis \n\n1977; Hawkins and Hartnoll 1982; Gaines et al. 1985; Caffey 1985; Roughgarden et al. 1988; \n\nUnderwood and Fairweather 1989) and it is often a direct consequence of the life history strategy of \n\nmany marine species (Fogarty et al. 1991). Recruitment, defined as the addition of new individuals to \n\na population, is indeed a major aspect of population dynamics and it is intrinsically related to concepts \n\nsuch as dispersal and population connectivity (Cowen et al. 2006). At the marine realm it \n\nencompasses a range of stages and processes that are affected by a suite of biotic and abiotic \n\nfactors, often operating at very different temporal and spatial scales (Caley et al. 1996). Although \n\nenvironmental variability is the dominant source of short-term fluctuations in recruitment, the longer-\n\nterm dynamics are regulated by the interaction between environmental stochasticity and modes of \n\npopulation regulation (Fogarty et al. 1991). \n\n\n\n\t 6 \n\nMost marine invertebrates are relatively sessile or sedentary as adults but have an obligate pelagic \n\nlarval stage that is dispersed by ocean currents while it develops competency to settle (Marshall and \n\nMorgan 2011). From the moment adult individuals reproduce, until juveniles are added to the \n\npopulation, early life stages (and even gametes if fertilization is external) are subject to the interactive \n\nrole of many physical, chemical and biological factors that can potentially affect the growth and \n\nsurvival of these free-living units. These include i) variation in the reproductive output of adult \n\npopulations which determines the abundance and quality of propagules in the water column (Uriz et al. \n\n1998; Treml et al. 2012); ii) trophic interactions such as competition, predation, the presence of \n\nsuitable prey, diseases, parasitism which can all act to determine the fate of early life-stages in a \n\nhighly dynamic environment (Keough and Downes 1982; Murphy et al. 2014; Gagliano et al. 2007; \n\nSpounagle et al. 2011); iii) variable offshore and nearshore oceanographic processes with distinct \n\nphysical attributes that can either limit or enhance the movement, development and onshore transport \n\nof planktonic larvae (Hawkins and Hartnoll 1982; Pineda et al. 2007; Morgan et al. 2009; Baltazar-\n\nSoares et al. 2014); iv) planktonic larval behaviour and choices made by larvae at the time of \n\nsettlement (Crisp 1955; Jenkins 2005; Murphy et al. 2014); and v) availability of suitable sites to settle \n\nand recruit (Gaines and Bertness 1992). Indeed, recruits may vary in their settlement/post-settlement \n\nfitness depending on their source, genetic composition and/or experiences during the larval stage (e.g. \n\nSchmidt and Rand 2001). \n\nRecruitment exhibits therefore a highly variable pattern, being determined by a set of interacting \n\nprocesses working upon the development, transport, settlement and post-settlement of early-life \n\nstages of marine invertebrates. Understanding the factors that affect the dispersal of propagules, their \n\nmortality rates, the recruitment output, the degree of connectivity between local populations, the \n\nphylogeographic structure and the impacts of local extinction, either natural or anthropogenic-derived, \n\non the resilience of marine populations holds particular importance in biological conservation. This \n\nchallenging task is essential for an ecosystemic approach to the management of marine environment, \n\nnot only for addressing short-term management issues but also to predict the potential effects of \n\nglobal change on species and systems. \n\n \n\nMolecular and genetic tools in connectivity studies \n\nGenetic studies can make an important contribution for the understanding of population dynamics by \n\nallowing us to test hypothesis about larval dispersal, population connectivity, genetic diversity, and \n\npopulation equilibrium. Comprehensive reviews of different genetic marker types have been previously \n\nreported (Avise 1994; Sunnucks 2000; Schl\u00f6tterer 2004), as were the advantages of microsatellites \n\nover other DNA markers (Schl\u00f6tterer 2000; Selkoe and Toonen 2006). Microsatellites or simple \n\nsequence repeats are tandemly repeated motifs of 1 - 6 bases found in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic \n\ngenomes analysed to date. High degree of length polymorphism and the relative ease of scoring the \n\nalleles represent two major features that make microsatellites of exceptional interest in genetic studies \n\n(Zane et al. 2002). Their high variability makes them very powerful genetic markers and they have \n\nproven to be an extremely useful tool for a range of applications including ecological and evolutionary \n\n\n\n\t 7 \n\nstudies, genomic mapping, pedigree analysis and investigations of the genetic structure of populations \n\n(for review see Jarne and Lagoda 1996). The use of genetic information has also become a popular \n\ntool in conservation studies (Wolf et al. 2000; Salgueiro et al. 2008), with only a few focusing on \n\ncommercially important or exploited species (e.g. Knutsen et al. 2003). Overall, fast-evolving markers \n\nsuch as microsatellites can increase our understanding of the population genetic structure in marine \n\norganisms and of the role of their reproductive strategies. It can also highlight some concepts such as \n\npopulation connectivity, gene flow, recruitment, larval dispersal, or contemporary demographic history \n\nof populations and thus providing important information for conservation and management strategies \n\n(Weersing and Toonen 2009). \n\nTo date, few studies have focused on the genetic structure of patellid limpets from the Macaronesia \n\narchipelagos (e.g. C\u00f4rte-Real et al. 1996; Weber and Hawkins 2005, 2006; S\u00e1-Pinto et al. 2005, \n\n2008). These focused mostly on phylogeny and/or inter-specific relationships among limpets, and in \n\nmost cases, the use of allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and/or nuclear genes, did not show the \n\nnecessary resolution to address questions about structuring processes, especially at intra-species \n\nlevels. Even so, despite relatively conflicting results about the phylogenetic relationships within the \n\ngenus Patella in the Macaronesia, all studies agree and point out for clear limitations in gene flow \n\nbetween the Macaronesian islands and the adjacent continental platforms. As previously mentioned, \n\nalthough microsatellites are increasingly recognized as an efficient and high-resolution genetic tool, \n\nand have been used in patellids limpets before (see Ribeiro et al. 2010), no study has yet used them \n\nto examine the genetic structure of patellid limpets throughout Macaronesia. \n\n \n\nLimpets from the Macaronesia (NE Atlantic) \n\nLocated in the Northeast Atlantic, the Macaronesia region consists of five archipelagos: Azores, \n\nMadeira, Selvagens, Canaries and Cape Verde (Fig. 1). The region is defined as a biogeographic \n\nentity based on the similarities found among archipelagos in terms of fauna and flora. All islands are of \n\nvolcanic origin and have distinct but fairly recent geological age (see \u00c1vila et al. 2016). Patellid limpets \n\ninhabiting these archipelagos are considered a valuable resource and have been intensively exploited \n\npresumably since islands were first colonized (Santos et al. 1995; C\u00f4rte-Real et al. 1996; Hawkins et \n\nal. 2000; Navarro et al. 2005). \n\nGiven that active grazing by limpets is a key process in shaping the structure and functioning of rocky \n\nshore communities (Underwood 1980; Branch 1981; Hawkins and Hartnoll 1983; Dungan 1986; \n\nMenge 2000; Boaventura et al. 2002; Jenkins et al. 2005; Jonsson et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2007; for \n\nmeta analysis of marine herbivory impacts see Poore et al. 2012), the over-exploitation of limpet \n\npopulations can have a large impact on the ecosystem. For instance, Martins et al. (2008) have shown \n\nthat exploitation of limpets in Azores has pushed the intertidal community to an alternate state where \n\nturf-forming algae have displaced barnacles as the dominant space occupier resulting in shifting the \n\nstructure and functioning of this ecosystem. In fact, under reduced numbers of limpets, algal \n\nsporelings and germlings can opportunistically grow to a size that allows them to escape grazing and \n\n\n\n\t 8 \n\nthus form mature algal patches that are able to persist through time altering the community dynamics \n\nand energy flow (Hawkins et al. 1992; Coleman et al. 2006). \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Location of Macaronesia archipelagos: Azores, Madeira, Canaries and Cape Verde. \n\nIn the Azores, limpets represented an important economic resource up to the 1980\u2019s, when they were \n\nthe 6th most profitable regional fishery (Martins et al. 1987a). In 1988 the limpet fishery in S\u00e3o Miguel, \n\nAzores, collapsed, and after a one-year ban throughout the archipelago, the stocks were allowed to \n\nrecover, avoiding catastrophic over-exploitation effects (Hawkins et al. 2000). In 1993, legislation was \n\npassed to protect limpet populations. Limpet no-take areas were created and seasonal harvesting \n\nrestrictions were applied in addition to minimum legal catch sizes (Decreto Regulamentar Regional n\u00ba \n\n14/93/A). A relatively recent survey of limpet populations in Azores has, however, detected clear signs \n\nof over-exploitation with populations virtually extinct in some islands (Martins et al. 2008). \n\nPatellid limpets are broadcast spawners and go through a planktonic larval stage in their life cycle. \n\nAdult animals are benthic and the larva is the only phase during their life-cycle which has the ability to \n\ndisperse over large spatial scales. In dispersive isolated oceanic islands such as Macaronesia islands, \n\nit is not clear whether the different island populations form a single metapopulation (a common larval \n\npool to each archipelago) or, in contrast, populations on each island are isolated from other \n\npopulations. This, however, has important implications for the management and conservation of \n\nexploited stocks. \n\nTwo well-known limpet species occur simultaneously across the archipelagos of Azores, Madeira \n\n(including Selvagens) and Canaries; these are Patella candei (d\u2019Orbigny 1840) and Patella aspera \n\n(R\u00f6ding 1798) (Fig. 2). The former is usually found at mid and high shore and also subtidally, \n\nespecially on boulders (Hawkins et al. 2000); the later occurs in the low intertidal and to 10 m depths \n\n\n\n\t 9 \n\n(Hawkins et al. 1990a); its distribution is not usually continuous, but interrupted by an algal turf in the \n\nlower eulittoral to shallow sublittoral (Hawkins et al. 1990b). In addition, P. piperata occurs in the \n\nCanaries and Madeira, but not the Azores (Christiaens 1973). \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Representative images (A and B) and illustrations (C) of Patella aspera (left) and Patella candei (right). Ilustrations by \n\nLes Gallagher - Fishpics\u00ae &amp; IMAR-DOP, University of the Azores. \n\n\n\n\t 10 \n\nIn the past decades, the taxonomy of the P. candei species complex across Macaronesia has \n\nreceived a fair amount of attention (see Christiaens 1973; C\u00f4rte-Real et al. 1996; Weber and Hawkins \n\n2002; S\u00e1-Pinto et al. 2005). For instance, a comprehensive taxonomic review of the genus Patella has \n\nassigned a particular sub-species to a specific archipelago, i.e. P. candei gomesii found throughout \n\nthe Azores, P. candei ordinaria in Madeira, P. candei crenata in the Canaries, and P. candei candei in \n\nthe Selvagens Islands and Fuerteventura island (for revision see Christiaens 1973). Subsequent work \n\nusing allozymes showed that P. candei from the Azores differed from P. candei in Madeira and \n\nCanaries (C\u00f4rte-Real et al. 1996). Allozyme electrophoresis was also used to study populations of P. \n\ncandei from the Macaronesian archipelagos (Weber and Hawkins 2002) and two distinct genetic \n\ngroups were found, one comprising P. candei gomesii and P. candei candei and the other combining \n\nP. candei crenata and P. candei ordinaria. A suggestion was made that these two groups should be \n\nconsidered as two subspecies of P. candei, based on intermediate phenotypes found in the Canaries \n\nand Selvagens. More recent work done by S\u00e1-Pinto et al. (2005) did not fully support previous \n\nfindings. In their study, and using modern mtDNA techniques, two well-differentiated groups were \n\nalways identified in the Macaronesian islands: one including P. candei from the Azores, Desertas and \n\nMadeira, and another one grouping P. candei from the Canaries and Selvagens together with Patella \n\nlugubris from Cape Verde. Given such confliting results, there is still some uncertainty as to whether \n\nP. candei from the different archipelagos should be given a specific status or not. \n\nWithout much taxonomic debate, and formerly known as P. ulyssiponensis (which is now the name \n\ngiven for continental specimens), the designation of P. aspera arose from the detection of genetic \n\ndifferences between individuals from Macaronesia islands and those from continental Europe (Weber \n\nand Hawkins 2005). Whilst P. candei is a typical gonochoristic species, P. aspera is a protandric \n\nsequential hermaphrodite species with external fertilization, where individuals start off as males but \n\nmay undergo a sex change with age (Martins et al. 1987b). Hence exploitation tends to focus on the \n\nlarger females in the population as larger limpets (predominantly females) are selectively removed \n\n(Martins et al. 2017). Despite conservation legislation in the region, P. aspera limpets are under \n\nsevere pressure and few individuals survive long enough to become females, a phenomenon that \n\nseverely restricts the effective population size (Allendorf et al. 2008), although some compensation is \n\napparent due to density dependent processes (Martins et al. 2017; see also Borges et al. 2016 and \n\nFenberg and Roy 2012 for work on the protandrous limpets Patella vulgata and Lottia gigantea, \n\nrespectively). \n\n \n\nAims, thesis outline and structure \n\nThis thesis is focused on limpets because they are an important resource, but also ecologically \n\nimportant species that require prioritizing conservation strategies. There is a clear need for work on \n\nlimpets in the Macaronesia, prompted by the fact that these species are highly exploited commercially \n\nand their stocks in most islands have been declining steadily with profound negative effects on coastal \n\ncommunities. One of the main goals of this thesis is to evaluate the genetic diversity and structure of \n\nlimpet populations, and hence, connectivity throughout the region, expecting that results can help \n\n\n\n\t 11 \n\nidentify stocks and conservation units with potential benefits for management plans targeting the \n\npreservation of limpets across the region. \n\nOverall, the following key questions related to limpet population dynamics in Macaronesia are \n\naddressed: are populations inhabiting different islands connected; if so, to what extent; and what is the \n\nspatial scale of gene flow, and when does it become restricted? Are there areas of higher genetic \n\ndiversity that require prioritizing and special protection? What is the impact of human exploitation on \n\nthe genetic diversity and structure of limpets? What factors contribute to the recruitment and realised \n\ndispersal of limpets throughout the region? Are limpet populations sufficiently resilient to withstand \n\nfishing pressure, given their isolation on oceanic islands? What recommendations can be made to \n\npromote better sustainable practices in limpet harvesting? \n\nThe thesis will focus only on the limpet species occurring in the Azores archipelago, where the core of \n\nexperimental work was performed: Patella candei and P. aspera. \n\nStarting with the development and characterization of high-resolution, species-specific microsatellite \n\nmarkers [Chapter 2 (Faria et al. 2016) and Chapter 3 (Faria et al. 2015)], this thesis reports patterns of \n\ngenetic diversity and structure for both P. candei and P. aspera throughout the Macaronesia region \n\n[Chapter 4 (Faria et al. 2017a) and Chapter 5 (Faria et al. 2017b), respectively]. Given that the \n\naddition of new individuals to populations is a direct consequence of the realised dispersal capacity of \n\na species, the spatial and temporal recruitment patterns of limpets and their relationship with \n\nenvironmental variables will then be described and discussed (Chapter 6). Given that P. aspera is \n\nknown to recruit mostly below low tides, and ocean conditions in the Azores are rather severe during \n\nwintertime preventing adequate sampling, monitoring of recruitment was only possible for P. candei, \n\nwhich is mostly distributed at mid-shore levels, providing a relatively easier way to access sampling \n\nsites. This research was complemented with a temperature-controlled larval rearing experiment, since \n\nit is known that temperature is the main factor affecting the development and duration of larval stages \n\nin open water, and therefore influences the capacity of larvae to disperse (Chapter 7). A final general \n\ndiscussion integrating the results of all chapters is provided in Chapter 8. This final chapter includes \n\nalso implications to the studied species conservation and management, and suggestions for future \n\nresearch. The structure and original content of the published papers (Chapters 2 \u2013 5) were maintained \n\nand only scientific style and format of references, figures and tables were changed to provide \n\nconsistency and standardization to the dissertation as a whole. \n\nOverall, the genetic data, alongside with biological, ecological and oceanographic information, \n\nproduced, gathered and/or discussed in this thesis, are expected to make an important contribution for \n\nthe understanding of population dynamics of limpets in Macaronesia by allowing testing hypothesis \n\nabout larval dispersal patterns, recruitment and life history traits, population connectivity, genetic \n\ndiversity, and resilience of limpet populations to human exploitation. Due to its multidisciplinary \n\napproach, this PhD thesis will provide information of theoretical as well as practical importance that \n\nmay be used to inform conservation strategies and promote the sustainable exploitation of limpets in \n\nMacaronesia. \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 12 \n\nReferences \n\nAinley DG, Blight LK (2009) Ecological repercussions of historical fish extraction from the Southern \n\nOcean.

The intertidal limpet Patella candei represents an important exploited resource in the Macaronesian \n\narchipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries (NE Atlantic). Despite being considered endemic, the \n\ntaxonomic status of P. candei throughout the region remains unclear.  \n\n2. The aim of this study was to develop novel microsatellite markers using next generation sequencing \n\nfor the limpet P. candei.  \n\n3. Twelve novel loci were described and amplified in 103 individuals from two populations (Azores and \n\nMadeira) using three multiplex reactions. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 14 and \n\nglobal observed heterozygosity was 0.417. Genetic differentiation between samples was highly \n\nsignificant (FST = 0.427) as two main gene pools (K = 2) were identified using Bayesian approaches.  \n\n4. The present genetic tool can be useful to establish the genetic structuring and patterns of \n\nconnectivity of P. candei in Macaronesia as well as to determine the number of extant subspecies \n\nwithin the P. candei species complex. Such data will provide a fundamental asset to define stocks and \n\nthus inform specific conservation strategies that foster the sustainable exploitation of the P. candei \n\ncomplex throughout Macaronesia archipelagos.  \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS: intertidal, archipelago, genetics, biogeography, invertebrates, fishing  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPublished as: \n\nFaria J, Pita A, Rivas M, Martins GM, Hawkins SJ, Ribeiro P, Neto AI, Presa P (2016) A multiplex \n\nmicrosatellite tool for conservation genetics of the endemic limpet Patella candei in the Macaronesian \n\narchipelagos. Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems 26: 775-781. \n\nDOI: 10.1002/aqc.2651 \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 24 \n\nIntroduction  \n\nThe Macaronesian (NE Atlantic) archipelagos comprise the oceanic islands of Azores, Madeira, \n\nCanaries and Cape Verde and are separated from the Euro-African mainland by between 100 km and \n\n1 900 km. Several patellid limpet species can be found on these islands and are viewed as key \n\nspecies for the structuring and functioning of rocky shore communities, since they graze on algae and \n\ncontrol their abundance (Coleman et al. 2006; Martins et al. 2010). Limpets have long been collected \n\nfor human consumption but the stocks in several islands have been over-exploited and face severe \n\ncollapse. Limpet overfishing has also resulted in ecological changes to the intertidal community \n\nstructure with important ecosystem-level impacts (Martins et al. 2008; Martins et al. 2010). The limpet \n\nspecies Patella candei (d\u2019Orbigny 1840) inhabits rocky shores from mid-intertidal to 5 m depth in all \n\nMacaronesian archipelagos except Cape Verde (C\u00f4rte-Real et al. 1996) and like P. aspera, is highly \n\nexploited for human consumption (Hawkins et al. 2000; Faria et al. 2015). Patella candei, as a \n\nMacaronesian endemic limpet, is threatened nowadays by over-exploitation and habitat disruption. \n\nThe taxonomy of the P. candei species complex has prompted considerable scientific debate in recent \n\ndecades (C\u00f4rte-Real et al. 1996; Weber and Hawkins, 2002; S\u00e1-Pinto et al. 2005). For instance, a \n\ncomprehensive taxonomic review of the genus Patella has assigned a particular subspecies to a \n\nspecific archipelago, i.e. P. candei gomesii found throughout the Azores, P. candei ordinaria in \n\nMadeira, P. candei crenata in the Canary Islands, and P. candei candei in the Selvagens Islands and \n\nFuerteventura island (for revision see Christiaens 1973). Later work using allozymes showed that P. \n\ncandei from the Azores differed from P. candei in Madeira and Canary Islands (C\u00f4rte-Real et al. \n\n1996). Weber and Hawkins (2002) also used allozyme electrophoresis to study populations of P. \n\ncandei from the Macaronesian archipelagos and found two distinct genetic groups, one comprising P. \n\ncandei gomesii and P. candei candei and the other comprising P. candei crenata and P. candei \n\nordinaria. The authors further suggest that these two groups should be considered as two subspecies \n\nof P. candei, based on intermediate phenotypes found in the Canary Islands and Selvagens. \n\nAdditional work done by S\u00e1-Pinto et al. (2005) using more modern mtDNA techniques did not fully \n\nsupport previous findings. In their study, two well-differentiated groups were always identified in the \n\nMacaronesian islands: one including P. candei from the Azores, Desertas and Madeira, and another \n\none grouping P. candei from the Canaries and Selvagens together with Patella lugubris from Cape \n\nVerde. The taxonomic status of Macaronesian limpets thus remains unclear with much controversy as \n\nto whether P. candei from the different archipelagos should be given a specific status. Despite its \n\nopportunistic life history (gonochoristic species with external fertilization, a pelagic larval stage, a \n\nrelatively continuous pattern of recruitment, and a fast growth rate) populations of P. candei candei are \n\nnow virtually extinct in all but one of the Canary Islands (N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. 2003; Navarro et al. 2005) and \n\ntherefore listed in the Catalogue of Endangered Species of the Canary Islands as well as in the \n\nSpanish National Catalogue of Endangered Species. Similarly, P. candei abundance has dramatically \n\ndecreased over the last decades in the Azores (Martins et al. 2011) and there is evidence of \n\nrecruitment failure on its smaller islands (Martins et al. 2008).  \n\n\n\n\t 25 \n\nThe aim of this study was to develop and test a novel multiplex microsatellite tool from the P. candei \n\ngenome that can be used to establish the genetic structure of populations and their biogeographic \n\ndistribution patterns across the Macaronesian archipelagos. Such a novel molecular tool can provide a \n\nfundamental asset to define stocks and thus inform conservation strategies that foster the sustainable \n\nexploitation of P. candei throughout Macaronesia. \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nA total of 103 individuals of P. candei were collected from Terceira (Azores, n = 53) and Madeira \n\n(Madeira, n = 50) that lie around 1150 km apart from each other (Fig. 1). Genomic DNA was isolated \n\nfrom muscle tissue using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA extraction kit. The quality and quantity of DNA \n\nextractions were assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). A DNA mix from \n\nfive individuals (> 10 ?g mL-1) from Azores was used to develop microsatellite-enriched libraries with \n\nthe new generation pyrosequencing GS-FLX titanium technology (454 Life Sciences, Roche) and \n\nreagents (Malausa et al. 2011 for details) as implemented by Genoscreen (France). In essence, small \n\ndigested fragments from genomic DNA were PCR amplified and enriched for microsatellite content by \n\nusing magnetic streptavidin beads and labelled TG, TC, AAC, AAG, AGG, ACG, ACAT and ACTC \n\nrepeat oligonucleotide probes. Subsequent enrichments were PCR amplified, and the sequences \n\nobtained were analysed using the bioinformatic QDD pipeline (Megl\u00e9cz et al. 2010). Sequences \n\ncontaining microsatellite motifs were identified and several primer pairs were tested for each marker \n\nuntil satisfactory PCR amplifications were achieved. \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Location of sampling sites for Patella candei populations in the NE Atlantic. \n\n\n\n\t 26 \n\nSixty-five primer pairs were selected for initial amplification testing in a subset of P. candei samples, \n\nfollowing standard PCR protocol (QIAGEN). Polymorphic markers that amplified reliably were 5? end-\n\nlabelled in the forward primer using 6-FAM, VIC, NED or PET fluorophores (Applied Biosystems). In \n\naddition, a five-bp pig-tail sequence (GTTT) was added to the 5? region of each reverse primer, to \n\nfacilitate adenylation (Brownstein et al. 1996). Markers were then tested for multiplex compatibility. \n\nThe number of markers included in each multiplex PCR was as high as possible, accounting for their \n\nallele size range, assigned dye label, and the avoidance of potential hairpin structures and primer \n\ndimers as indicated in AUTODIMER (Vallone and Butler 2004). MULTIPLEX MANAGER v.1.0 \n\n(Holleley and Geerts 2009) was used to combine all markers into the most efficient number of PCR \n\nreactions. After testing for suitable amplification of the selected multiplex, each setup was applied to \n\ngenotype all P. candei samples. Multiplex PCR was carried out in 10 ?L reactions containing ~30 ng \n\nDNA template, 1 \u00d7 QiagenTM Multiplex PCR Kit, 0.5 \u2013 1.2 ?mol L-1 of each primer and ddH2O. \n\nParameters for thermal cycling were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, eight touchdown cycles (reduction of \n\n0.5 \u00b0C per cycle) at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing temperature (TA + 2 \u00b0C; Table 1) for 60 s, and 72\u00b0C for \n\n40 s; 25 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, TA for 60 s, and 72\u00b0C for 40 s; 10 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 53\u00b0C for 45 \n\ns, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s. A final elongation was performed at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. Genotyping was performed \n\non an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems) automated DNA sequencer using an internal size standard \n\n(GeneScanTM 500Liz\u00ae, Applied Biosystems) for accurate sizing and GENEMAPPERTM v.4.2 (Applied \n\nBiosystems) was used for allele calling. \n\n \nTable 1. Characteristics of 12 microsatellite loci developed from P. candei genome and casted in three multiplex PCR reactions. \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 27 \n\nStandard genetic diversity estimates (observed and expected heterozygosities \u2013 HO and HE) and tests \n\nfor linkage disequilibrium and Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were calculated using GENEPOP \n\nv.4.2 (Raymond and Rousset 1995). The presence of null alleles was assessed at a 95% confidence \n\ninterval using MICRO-CHECKER v.2.2.3 (van Oosterhout et al. 2004). Null allele frequencies were \n\nestimated for each locus and population with FREENA (Chapuis and Estoup 2007). Genetic \n\ndifferentiation between samples (FST) was calculated using with ARLEQUIN v.3.5.1.3 (Excoffier and \n\nLischer 2010) following Weir and Cockerham (1984) and FREENA, which uses Weir (1996) \n\ncalculations and the so-called ENA correction method for the positive bias on FST induced by the \n\npresence of null alleles (Chapuis and Estoup 2007). Population structure was assessed using the \n\nBayesian model-based clustering approach implemented in STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. \n\n2000) and individuals were assigned to a given cluster without using any prior information about their \n\norigin. Correlated allele frequencies and the admixture model were assumed. Ten independent runs \n\nwere made for K = 1 \u2013 2 with each run consisting of a burn-in of 105 Markov-chain Monte Carlo steps, \n\nfollowed by 5 \u00d7 105 iteration steps. Selection of the most likely number of genetic clusters (K) was \n\nbased on Evanno et al. (2005) ?K method. For comparison purposes, genetic differentiation between \n\nsamples was estimated either on all the loci set, or on a subset of loci after removing those bearing \n\nputative null alleles. Reassignment of significance levels for multiple tests comparison was performed \n\nusing the sequential Bonferroni correction (Rice 1989).  \n\n \n\nResults \n\nThe GS-FLX sequencing platform produced 30 683 individual sequences, of which 1 799 contained \n\nmicrosatellite motifs. Primer pairs were designed for 107 potential markers, where 88% of them were \n\ndinucleotides, 10% trinucleotides and 2% tetranucleotides. Several primer pairs out of the 65 selected \n\nfor initial amplifications were discarded either because they showed tri-allelic patterns, exhibited \n\nartifact bands interfering with allele calling, and/or were monomorphic for all samples screened. \n\nTwelve primer pairs that showed clean polymorphisms were combined in three optimized multiplex \n\nreactions and assayed in all samples (Table 1).  \n\nPreliminary analyses showed that populations are well differentiated and therefore genetic diversity \n\nindices were calculated for each population separately. All loci amplified in the Azorean sample. In \n\ncontrast, five loci failed to amplify in individuals from Madeira (Table 2). Loci CAN9, CAN26 and \n\nCAN33 did not amplify at all and two additional loci failed to amplify in more than 30% of the Madeira \n\nsample size. Since microsatellite markers were developed from Azorean P. candei individuals, the \n\namplification failure of five loci in Madeira sample, suggests that the genetic differentiation between \n\nsamples is very significant.  \n\nThe number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 14 in Terceira (Azores) and showed average \n\nobserved (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosity of 0.359 and 0.436, respectively (Table 2). The \n\nnumber of alleles in the Madeira sample ranged from 2 to 12, and observed (HO) and expected (HE) \n\nheterozygosity were 0.289 and 0.479, respectively (Table 2).  \n\n\n\n\t 28 \n\nTable 2. Genetic variation for twelve microsatellites in two populations of Patella candei from the Macaronesia archipelagos of \n\nAzores and Madeira. \n\n \n\nThere was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium among pairs of loci and three loci in Terceira and four \n\nloci in Madeira deviated significantly from HWE (Table 2). Probable causes for such deficit are non-\n\nrandom mating, population subdivision (Wahlund effect) or the presence of null alleles (Allendorf and \n\nLuikart 2007). It is noteworthy that all loci causing departures from HWE showed a high putative \n\nfrequency of null alleles as indicated by MICRO-CHECKER and FREENA (Table 2). Again, null alleles \n\nwere more often found in the genotypic distributions of Madeira, suggesting high amplification \n\nmispriming due to its genetic divergence from the Azorean sample.  \n\nGenetic differentiation between samples was very high and significant (FST_ARLEQUIN = 0.427, P &lt;\n\n0.001). FST estimates obtained by excluding null alleles were slightly lower (FST_FREENA corrected for \n\nnull alleles = 0.336; 95% CI (0.139 \u2013 0.486) than the ones obtained when null alleles were ignored \n\n(FST_FREENA = 0.359; 95% CI (0.159 \u2013 0.515)). In this case, the occurrence of null alleles seems to have \n\nlittle impact on estimates of population differentiation. Strong subpopulation structure was also \n\ndetected using Bayesian inferences, with the number K = 2 being chosen by the ad hoc statistic ?K as \n\nthe most probable number of gene pools present in the sample system, a result that agrees with the \n\nhigh FST divergence level observed between samples. Similar results were obtained when restricting \n\nthe differentiation analysis to the loci set that did not exhibit null alleles (data not shown).  \n\n \n\nDiscussion  \n\nPresent results performed with a new genetic tool on two P. candei samples from Macaronesia \n\nprovide evidence of a large demographic uncoupling among geographically distant limpet populations. \n\nSuch a phylogeographic break is likely due to limited larval connectivity among archipelagos since \n\nadult patellid limpets are broadcast benthic spawners and the planktonic larval stage susceptible to \n\n\n\n\t 29 \n\npassive dispersal is believed to range from a few days up to 27 days (Ribeiro 2008; Nakano and \n\nSasaki 2011). While many other factors can be involved (Cowen and Sponaugle 2009 for review), the \n\nputative limited dispersal ability of patellids, and the relationship between their life-history \n\ncharacteristics and ocean circulation processes probably contributed to the genetic differentiation \n\nobserved between archipelagos. In the context of fisheries management, population discrimination \n\nfrom seemingly uniform stocks is paramount to correctly designate discrete management units for \n\nconservation. Any conservation strategy aimed at the sustainable exploitation of P. candei throughout \n\nMacaronesia should be archipelago-specific, and consider aspects such as local population \n\ndemography (e.g. limpet densities) and region-specific life-history traits (e.g. time of reproduction and \n\nrecruitment).  \n\nThis study provides important insights into both the potential use of microsatellites in addressing the \n\ngenetic population structure of P. candei throughout Macaronesian archipelagos and the micro-\n\nevolutionary processes that operated on the phylogeography of limpet populations across these \n\nisolated oceanic islands. In particular, it will be important to understand the scale and direction of \n\nconnectivity among islands within each archipelago and to address inter-island population source\u2013sink \n\ndynamics. For example, population genetic studies of the endemic Hawaiian limpets have shown \n\nsignificant subpopulation structures in three species of Cellana spp. Those results prompted their \n\nincorporation into management plans to deter previous poor conservation views of a single \n\nmanagement unit (Bird et al. 2007).  \n\nThis novel multiplex microsatellite tool can be used to underpin the delimitation of suitable \n\nmanagement areas by identifying barriers to dispersal within each archipelago, and provide the \n\npopulation genetic basis for the formulation of stock-specific conservation strategies for the \n\nsustainable exploitation of P. candei throughout Macaronesia. Genetic information can also be useful \n\nto assess the effectiveness of current marine protected areas acting as larvae source to adjacent \n\npopulations. It is clear that these endemic species require careful management if extinction is to be \n\navoided as appears to have happened with P. candei candei in much of its range in the Canary \n\narchipelago.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis research was partially supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through \n\nthe COMPETE - Operational Competitiveness Programme and national funds through FCT \u2013 \n\nFoundation for Science and Technology, under the projects PTDC/BIA-BIC/ 115837/2009 and PEst-\n\nC/MAR/LA0015/2013, by the Strategic Funding UID/Multi/04423/2013 through national funds provided \n\nby FCT \u2013 Foundation for Science and Technology and European Regional Development Fund \n\n(ERDF), in the framework of the programme PT2020 and by cE3c funding (Ref: UID/BIA/00329/2013). \n\nIt was also partly supported by CIRN (Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Recursos Naturais, University of the \n\nAzores), and CIIMAR (Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research, Porto, \n\nPortugal).

Animal Genetics 46(1): 96-97. DOI: 10.1111/age.12243  \n\n\n\n\t 36 \n\nBackground \n\nPatellid limpets are ecologically important keystone grazers having a long history of overexploitation in \n\nthe Macaronesian Archipelagos (NE Atlantic islands), where some species, such as Patella aspera, \n\nare under serious risk (Hawkins et al. 2000; Martins et al. 2008). Patella aspera is a protandric \n\nsequential hermaphrodite species with external fertilization, in which individuals start as males but \n\nmay undergo a sex reversal with age (Martins et al. 1987). Hence, exploitation tends to focus on the \n\nlarger females in the population as larger limpets (predominantly females) are selectively removed. \n\nDespite conservation legislation in Canaries, Madeira and Azores, limpets are under severe pressure \n\nand few individuals survive long enough to become females, a phenomenon that severely restricts the \n\neffective population size (Waples 2006). New conservation actions for the protection and sustainable \n\nuse of limpets in Macaronesian archipelagos are urgently needed and should be based on a \n\nmultidisciplinary framework based on knowledge of the population dynamics and connectivity of this \n\nspecies.  \n\n \n\nSamples, genetic analysis and results \n\nA total of 309 microsatellite loci were isolated from the P. aspera genome using a 454 sequencing \n\nplatform, and three multiplex sets comprising 17 loci for rapid population genetic analyses were \n\ndeveloped in this species (see Supplementary Material for methodological details; Table S1). Samples \n\nfrom three populations of P. aspera (n = 127) from the Macaronesian islands (two from the \n\narchipelago of Azores and one from the Canaries) were fully genotyped using capillary \n\nelectrophoresis. Genetic diversity and population differentiation estimates were assessed. All loci were \n\npolymorphic, and a large deficit in heterozygosity was commonplace across markers and samples \n\n(Table 1; Table S2). Such a deficit probably arose as a consequence of complex population processes \n\nresulting from overexploitation as well as from the usual null allele impact in molluscan microsatellites. \n\nNonetheless, no proper inferences on the causality of this phenomenon can be made until assessed \n\nby large-scale population genotyping studies.  \n\n \n\nTable 1. Mean genetic diversity estimates based on 17 microsatellite loci for three Patella aspera populations from the \n\nMacaronesian islands of S. Miguel (Azores, SMI_1 and SMI_2) and Gran Canaria (Canaries, CAN). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 37 \n\nPairwise comparisons of diversity among the three populations analysed showed a significant FST \n\ndistance in 12 of the 17 markers analysed (Table S2), averaging FST = 0.047 (P &lt;0.001). Noteworthy, \n\nhierarchical AMOVAs showed that such interpopulation genetic distance was caused by the \n\ndivergence between each of the Azorean samples and the Canarian sample (FST = 0.074, P &lt;0.001), \n\nbut not between the Azorean samples (FST = 0.017, P > 0.01) (Table S3).  \n\n \n\nComments \n\nDespite the low number of samples analysed, present data suggest that the divergence found \n\nbetween archipelagos amounts to that expected between allopatric species rather than among \n\nconspecific populations. Next steps include the study of the genetic population structure of P. aspera \n\nthroughout its distribution range so that future efforts can focus on identifying scales of connectivity \n\nand hence stock integrity across the Macaronesian Archipelagos. These novel tools can be useful to \n\ninform management of fisheries and preserve endemic limpet stocks that have been severely depleted \n\nin Macaronesia.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis research was developed under the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (FCT) project \n\nPTDC/BIA-BIC/115837/2009 and supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) \n\nthrough the COMPETE\u2014Operational Competitiveness Program and national funds through FCT \n\nunder the projects PTDC/BIA- BIC/115837/2009 and PEst-C/MAR/LA0015/2011.

A DNA admixture from ten individuals (10 ?g ml-1) was \n\nused to build an enriched microsatellite library (Genoscreen, France). Fragments from genomic DNA \n\nwere enriched in single sequence repeats using magnetic streptavidin beads and labelled \n\noligonucleotide probes, i.e. (TG)n, (TC)n, (AAC)n, (AAG)n, (AGG)n, (ACG)n, (ACAT)n and (ACTC)n. \n\nHigh-throughput microsatellite isolation was made upon 454 GS-FLX\u00ae Titanium (Roche) \n\npyrosequencing on the enriched library. A total of 28 992 raw sequences were produced and titrated \n\nwith QDD software (Megl\u00e9cz et al. 2010) to recover 4 754 sequences containing microsatellites. \n\nValidation of primer pairs was achieved on 309 reads comprising 89% dinucleotides, 9% trinucleotides \n\nand 2.0% tetranucleotides. Forty pairs of primers (25 di-, 14 tri-, and 1 tetranucleotides) with high and \n\nclose melting temperature, compatible allelic ranges and no misspriming were tested individually and \n\nPCR gradient conditions were assayed to check for their polymorphism across 10 trial samples. \n\nTwenty-three markers were discarded due to artifactual PCR bands or monomorphism. A final set of \n\n17 optimally-amplified polymorphic loci showing amplicon size range of 110 bp - 353 bp was selected \n\nand their forward primers were fluorescently labelled with NED, VIC, PET, or 6?FAM (Applied \n\nBiosystems, Life Technologies) and a GTTT sequence \u201cpig-tail\u201d tag was added to the 5\u2019 end of all \n\nreverse primers (Brownstein et al. 1996). Marker amplification was carried out in a MyCyclerTM thermal \n\ncycler (BioRad) using a touchdown PCR protocol on a final volume of 10 ?L containing 10 ng DNA \n\ntemplate, 1 QiagenTM Multiplex PCR Kit 0.4 - 1.2 M of each primer and ddH2O. The PCR routine \n\nconsisted of an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 5 cycles of touchdown amplification \n\n(denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing temperature (TA) for 1 min descending by 0.2\u00b0C intervals \n\nto the optimal TA (Table S1), plus extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 sec; 22 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, optimal \n\nTA (Table S1) for 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 sec; 10 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 53\u00b0C for 50 \n\nsec, 72\u00b0C for 45 sec; and a final extension step at 60\u00b0C for 30 min.? The 17 markers calibrated were \n\ncombined in three multiplexed PCR sets for a more rapid and cost-efficient multilocus genotyping \n\nusing AUTODIMER (Vallone and Butler 2004) (Table S1). \n\nMultiplex PCR followed a similar protocol as described above, whereas cycle adjustments were only \n\napplied to the touchdown amplification in all mixes and TA was lowered by 0.5\u00b0C on each consecutive \n\ncycle up to the optimal TA. Amplified fragments were electrophoresed in an ABI 3730 automatic DNA \n\nsequencer (Applied Biosystems) using the internal size standard GeneScanTM 500Liz\u00ae (Applied \n\nBiosystems) and genotypes were scored using GENEMAPPERTM v.4.2 (Applied Biosystems). The \n\nnumber of alleles per locus and sample, observed (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosities, \n\ninbreeding coefficients (FIS), deviations from the Hardy \u2013 Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage \n\ndisequilibrium (LD) were estimated in GenAlEx v.6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2012). Allelic richness (AR) \n\nwas estimated after the rarefaction method implemented in ADZE v.1.0 (Szpiech et al. 2008). MICRO-\n\n\n\n\t 39 \n\nCHECKER v. 2.2.3 was used to assess the presence of scoring errors and putative null alleles (van \n\nOosterhout et al. 2004). Global and single-locus FST estimates were calculated with ARLEQUIN \n\nv.3.5.1.3 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010). Hierarchical partition of the genetic diversity within and \n\nbetween archipelagos was performed with an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) as \n\nimplemented in ARLEQUIN. Multiple statistical tests were nominally adjusted with the sequential \n\nBonferroni method (Rice 1989).  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nBrownstein MJ, Carpten JD, Smith JR (1996) Modulation of non-templated nucleotide addition by Taq \n\nDNA polymerase: primer modifications that facilitate genotyping.

In the archipelagos of Macaronesia (NE Atlantic), limpets have been \n\nextensively exploited probably since islands were first colonized. This has led to profound \n\nconsequences in the dynamics of rocky shore communities. The Patella candei complex includes \n\nvarious subspecies of limpets that are ascribed to a particular archipelago and has been the focus of \n\nseveral taxonomic surveys without much agreement. Under a conservational perspective, we apply \n\nmorphometric and genetic analyses to test subspecies boundaries in P. candei and to evaluate its \n\ncurrent population connectivity throughout Macaronesia (Azores, Madeira, and Canaries). A highly \n\nsignificant genetic break between archipelagos following isolation by distance was detected (FST = \n\n0.369, P &lt;0.001). Contrastingly, significant genetic differentiation among islands (i.e. Azores) was \n\nabsent possibly indicating ongoing gene flow via larval exchange between populations. Significant \n\nshell-shape differences among archipelagos were also detected using both distance-based and \n\ngeometric morphometric analyses. Adaptive processes associated with niche differentiation and \n\nstrong barriers to gene flow among archipelagos may be the mechanisms underlying P. candei \n\ndiversification in Macaronesia. Under the very probable assumption that populations of P. candei from \n\neach archipelago are geographically and/or ecologically isolated populations, the various subspecies \n\nwithin the P. candei complex may be best thought of as true species using the denomination: P. \n\ncandei in Selvagens, Patella gomesii in Azores, Patella ordinaria in Madeira, and Patella crenata for \n\nCanaries. This would be in agreement with stock delimitation and units of conservation of P. candei \n\nsensu latu along Macaronesia.  \n\n  \n\nKEYWORDS: allopatric speciation, conservation genetics, gene flow barriers, limpets, phenotypic \n\nplasticity  \n\n \n\n \n\nPublished as: \n\nFaria J, Martins GM, Pita A, Ribeiro PA, Hawkins SJ, Presa P, Neto AI (2017) Disentangling the \n\ngenetic and morphological structure of Patella candei complex in Macaronesia (NE Atlantic).

Introduction \n\nConservation efforts applied to human-exploited and threatened species requires a comprehensive \n\nknowledge about population structure and factors that shape differentiation within a species (Lande \n\n1988). For instance, natural and/or human-induced barriers across a species distributional range can \n\nhasten isolation between populations by restricting the amount of individuals that can freely migrate \n\n(Barber et al. 2000; Kelly and Palumbi 2010). Such constraints to connectivity can lead to genetically \n\ndeprived populations that, in the face of intense human-exploitation, are likely to succumb and \n\ndisappear. To overcome isolation, many species have evolved life-history traits that are able to \n\nmaximize dispersion and connectivity across large geographical areas (e.g. White et al. 2011). For \n\ninstance, many widely distributed marine organisms with limited adult movement avoid population \n\ndifferentiation by exhibiting large population sizes with high levels of fecundity and by releasing larvae \n\nthat can potentially disperse in the water column for a considerable amount of time until they reach \n\ntheir final destination (e.g. Faria et al. 2013). However, the extent of successful dispersion, which is a \n\nmajor determinant of population dynamics and structure, is a function of multiple and often interacting \n\nfactors. For instance, an extensively and well-mixed larval pool does not necessarily lead to \n\nwidespread connectivity and lack of population genetic structure over large spatial scales (e.g. Keever \n\net al. 2009). The complex interplay between physical processes (e.g. coastal topography, stratified \n\nwater columns, tidal forces, wind, buoyancy, surface waves, and turbulence) and life-history traits (e.g. \n\ntime of spawning, larval behaviour, growth and survival rates, pelagic larval duration), often interacting \n\nat fine to mesoscales, can result in a broad range of dispersal and metapopulation connectivity \n\npatterns (see review in Cowen and Sponaugle 2009). Similarly, historical events such as past \n\nglaciations and changes in sea level can determine the contemporary distribution of populations (e.g. \n\nPortnoy et al. 2014).  \n\nIn the last few decades, genetic methods have become a tool of excellence in investigating population \n\ndifferentiation estimates of a given species across its distributional range. Particularly, high-resolution \n\nnuclear markers such as microsatellites have been widely applied to conservation genetics (Guichoux \n\net al. 2011) and to the identification of populations requiring prioritizing protective measures (e.g. \n\nSandoval-Castillo and Beheregaray 2015). \n\nThe Macaronesia comprises five NE Atlantic archipelagos: Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries and \n\nCape Verde. The region is defined as a biogeographical entity based on the existence of many shared \n\nelements in the flora and fauna among archipelagos. All are of volcanic origin and have distinct but \n\nfairly recent geological times of origin (\u00c1vila et al. 2016). Patellid limpets inhabiting these archipelagos \n\nare considered a valuable resource and have been intensively exploited presumably since islands \n\nwere first colonized (Santos et al. 1995; C\u00f4rte-Real et al. 1996; Hawkins et al. 2000). In most islands, \n\nheavy exploitation has led to dramatic decreases in limpet abundances with current populations \n\nshowing clear signs of over-exploitation (Martins et al. 2008; Martins et al. 2017). Because limpet\u2019s \n\ngrazing activity acts as a key process in shaping the structure and functioning of rocky shore \n\ncommunities (Hawkins and Hartnoll 1983), the chronic removal of limpets has led to an upward \n\nextension of turf-forming algae (see Boaventura et al. 2002; Martins et al. 2010). In fact, under \n\n\n\n\t 47 \n\nreduced numbers of limpets, algal spores can opportunistically grow to a size that allows them to \n\nescape grazing and thus form mature algal patches that are able to persist through time altering the \n\ncommunity dynamics and energy flow (Coleman et al. 2006; Martins et al. 2010). \n\nThe intertidal limpet Patella candei (d\u2019Orbigny 1840), which is exclusive to Macaronesia, occurs on \n\nrocky shores from the mid intertidal down to 5 m depth across all archipelagos except in Cape Verde \n\nwhere it is absent (Christiaens 1973). They are broadcast spawners with fertilization occurring in the \n\nwater column. According to Martins et al. (1987), P. candei is a gonochoric species that spawns \n\nthroughout the year, without synchronized resting periods. While very few studies have sentenced the \n\npelagic larvae duration (PLD) in species of the genus Patella (e.g. Dodd 1957; Ribeiro 2008) with \n\ngross estimates ranging from 2 - 32 days depending on the species, temperature and settlement cues, \n\nthere is still no available information about the PLD of P. candei. Individuals of P. candei have a sub-\n\noval to stellate shell shape and an orange to greyish foot with a thin darker border. Morphological \n\nplasticity associated with specific micro-habitat conditions (i.e. substrate complexity) and \n\nenvironmental variation (i.e. wave exposure) is known to occur in this species (Hawkins et al. 1990). \n\nFor instance, two distinct habitat-related morphs of P. candei are referred for the Azores: the \u2018fly \n\nlimpet\u2019 and the \u2018smooth limpet\u2019 (Hawkins et al. 1990). Moreover, the morphological variation \n\nassociated to each archipelago has led Christiaens (1973) to describe four distinct subspecies within \n\nP. candei complex: P. candei gomesii in Azores, P. candei ordinaria in Madeira, P. candei candei in \n\nSelvagens and P. candei crenata in the Canaries. This classification is not entirely supported by \n\nsubsequent studies. For instance, C\u00f4rte-Real et al. (1996) found no differences in radular morphology \n\nand soft-body parts among archipelagos but showed that shell shape and allozyme characters from P. \n\ncandei in Azores were clearly distinguished from P. candei in the Madeira and the Canaries. Weber \n\nand Hawkins (2002) also showed that P. candei shell shape could be distinguished among \n\narchipelagos and that allozyme retrieved two well-differentiated groups: P. candei from Azores and \n\nSelvagens, and P. candei from Madeira and Canaries. More recent research, using mtDNA, showed \n\nthat samples of P. candei from the Azores, Madeira and Desertas (located about 25 km southeast of \n\nMadeira Island) form a well-supported group, while individuals sampled in Selvagens and Canaries \n\nalways grouped together in a different clade (S\u00e1-Pinto et al. 2005; 2008). The taxonomic status of \n\nMacaronesian limpets thus remains unclear with much controversy as to whether P. candei from the \n\ndifferent archipelagos should be given a specific status. \n\nIn this study, we use morphometric and molecular genetic methods to assess the existence of distinct \n\ngroups of P. candei across Macaronesia, testing the subspecies boundaries within the species. At \n\nmultiple spatial scales, we evaluate the degree of contemporary connectivity among populations and \n\nhypothesize that populations geographically closer to each other are likely more related and \n\nconnected via larval dispersion. Besides the assessment of genetic diversity and structure of P. candei \n\npopulations across archipelagos, and given the importance of defining conservation units in fisheries \n\nplanning (Hawkins et al. 2016), we provide discussion and guidance about protective measures of \n\nsuch threatened marine resource, highlighting the importance of considering levels of genetic diversity \n\nin populations as well as their uniqueness. \n\n\n\n\t 48 \n\n2. Methods \n\n2.1. Morphometric analyses \n\n2.1.1. Distance-based analyses \n\nIndividuals of P. candei were collected across the Macaronesia archipelagos of Azores, Madeira, and \n\nCanarias, in 12 different islands (n = 917) during the summer of 2011 (Fig. 1). In all islands, individuals \n\nwere collected on intertidal platforms. The soft tissue of all individuals was carefully removed for \n\ngenetic analyses, and the shells were marked individually. Shell morphometry was examined using \n\nthe procedure described in detail by Cabral (2007). In summary, five distances were measured on \n\neach shell: shell length (SL), shell maximum width (SW), shell width at apex (SWA), distance from \n\napex to anterior tip (SAA), and shell height (SH). These distances were then used to calculate base \n\nellipticity (BE), base eccentricity (BEC), conicity (CO), and cone eccentricity (CE) for each individual \n\nshell (see Cabral 2007 for further details). Shells were measured using a Vernier caliper with a \n\nprecision of 0.1 mm. Individuals with signs of shell damage or with clear home fitting deformation were \n\ndiscarded from the analyses. The four variables were inspected for collinearity and removed from the \n\nanalyses when collinearity was high (r > 0.3). \n\n \n \nFigure 1. Map of sampling locations for Patella candei collected from the Macaronesian archipelagos of Azores, Madeira, and \n\nCanaries (NE Atlantic). n columns indicate the number of individuals used for distance-based morphometrics, geometric \n\nmorphometrics, and genetic analyses, respectively. \n\n \n\nExamination of the spatial variation in shell morphometry among archipelagos was analysed using a \n\ntwo-way fully hierarchical analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the following factors: archipelago (fixed) \n\nand island (random and nested within archipelago). Analyses were performed using PERMANOVA+ \n\n(Anderson et al. 2008) based on Euclidean distances and using 999 permutations. PERMANOVA is a \n\n\n\n\t 49 \n\npermutational-based test and produces results analogous to ANOVA when based on Euclidean \n\ndistances (Anderson 2001). This test was preferred over classical ANOVA because it allows the use \n\non unbalanced designs (e.g. different number of islands per archipelago). When needed, SL was used \n\nas a covariate in order to adjust for differences in morphometry with animal size. Prior to analysis, \n\nPERMDISP was used to test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions. All analyses were performed \n\non untransformed data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to determine the linear \n\ncombination of morphometric descriptors that account for the variation in the data. Shell-shape \n\nvariation between P. candei morphotypes (\u201cfly\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d) from Azores was also accessed by \n\nmeans of ANOVA. Given the difficulties in sorting all individuals into the \u201cfly\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d categories, \n\nonly distinctive shells of each morphotype were used in the analysis (n = 346). Note, however, that \n\nthis criteria may upward bias the degree of differentiation between morphotypes. \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Geometric morphometric analyses \n\nA total of 83 P. candei collected across archipelagos were used for landmark-based geometric \n\nmorphometric analysis (Bookstein 1991; Fig. 1). For imaging, shells were positioned in a light \n\nbackground and digital high-resolution images of the dorsal surface were captured using a CANON \n\nEOS 600D camera mounted on a tripod to maintain the distance for all samples and to ensure that the \n\nlens was parallel to the surface examined. The anterior\u2013posterior axis of each specimen was identified \n\nusing the scars from each individual body left on the ventral surface of the shell. A fan was used to \n\nposition each specimen along such axis and ensuring that the apex of each shell coincided with the \n\nvertical line of the fan (Fig. S1). A tps file of each archipelago specimens was created using tpsUtil, \n\nand tpsDig2 (Rohlf 2015) was used to place a total of 37 landmarks on the shell apex and on the \n\nintersection of the fan and shell of each sample specimen image. Except for the shell apex landmark, \n\nall other points (at the shell border) do not necessarily represent homologous landmarks from a \n\ndevelopment point of view, but can be used to decompose objectively the shell shape of limpets. \n\nThese points are referred to as semi-landmarks and can be used to capture information about \n\ncurvature (Gunz and Mitteroecker 2013). Specimens were then aligned using a Generalized \n\nProcrustes Analysis (GPA) (Rohlf and Slice 1990) to remove all the differences due to translation, \n\nrotation, and scale (Bookstein 1991). In this process, semi-landmarks are allowed to slide along their \n\ntangent directions so as to minimize the bending energy between each specimen and the reference \n\nform. The resulting aligned Procrustes coordinates represent the shape of each specimen. For more \n\ndetails on geometric morphometric methodologies using landmarks, see Bookstein (1991), Zelditch et \n\nal. (2012), Adams et al. (2013). Centroid size (CS), given by the square root of the sum of squared \n\ndistances of a set of landmarks from their centroid, was also calculated (Rohlf and Slice 1990). A \n\nProcrustes permutation analysis of variance (Procrustes ANOVA) performed with a residual \n\nrandomization permutation procedure (Collyer et al. 2015; Adams et al. 2016) was used to determine \n\npatterns of shell shape variation between archipelagos. The aim is to test groups (archipelagos) \n\nconsidering the influence of phenotypic change associated with body size (i.e. body size was \n\ncalculated from landmark configurations as centroid size). Actually, the Procrustes ANOVA between \n\n\n\n\t 50 \n\nshape and size, using CS is a way to assess interspecific allometry (Villegas et al. 2002). Because \n\nallometry was detected among archipelagos (see section 3), the full dataset was divided in two: one \n\nwith small limpets (SMALL) and one with big limpets (BIG). Principal components analysis (PCA) was \n\nused to provide a graphical depiction of patterns of shape variation across the two datasets. Thin plate \n\nsplines were used to provide a visual representation of the shape changes between each group mean \n\nand overall consensus configuration. All analyses and graphical representations were performed in R \n\n(R Core Team 2014) using the packages GEOMORPH (Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013). Geometric \n\nmorphometric analysis was also used to determine shell shape variation between the \u201cfly\u201d and \n\n\u201csmooth\u201d P. candei morphotypes from Azores (n = 23 and n = 34, respectively). \n\n \n\n2.2. Genetic analysis \n\n2.2.1. Sampling and laboratory protocols \n\nA total of 560 individuals of Patella candei from the three archipelagos were used for genetic analysis \n\n(Fig. 1). Upon collection, limpets were preserved in 96% ethanol and frozen for later processing. At the \n\nlaboratory, samples were subject to DNA extraction from the foot muscle tissue using the E.Z.N.A. \n\nMollusc DNA extraction kit and following the manufacturer\u2019 instructions. The quality and quantity of \n\nDNA extractions were assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). All \n\nindividuals were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci using the primer pairs and following the \n\namplification protocol described in Faria et al. (2016). Briefly, microsatellites were amplified in three \n\ndistinct multiplex PCRs (PcaMix1: loci CAN18, CAN25, CAN27, CAN53; PcaMix2: loci CAN9, CAN26, \n\nCAN32, CAN40; PcaMix3: loci CAN23, CAN33, CAN56, CAN60) on 10 ?l reactions containing ~30 ng \n\nDNA template, 1 \u00d7 QiagenTM Multiplex PCR Kit, 0.5 \u2013 1.2 ?mol/L of each primer and ddH2O. \n\nGenotyping was performed on an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems) automated DNA sequencer using an \n\ninternal size standard (GeneScanTM 500Liz\u00ae, Applied Biosystems) for accurate sizing and \n\nGENEMAPPERTM v.4.2 (Applied Biosystems) was used for allele calling. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Genetic variation \n\nGenetic diversity estimates such as allele frequencies and observed and expected heterozygosities \n\n(HO and HE) were estimated in GenAlEx v.6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 20012). The fixation index (FIS), \n\nlinkage disequilibrium, and deviations from the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were tested in \n\nGENEPOP v.4.2 (Raymond and Rousset 1995). Allelic richness [AR(g)] and private allele richness \n\n[AP(g)] were estimated using the rarefaction method implemented in ADZE v.1.0 (Szpiech et al. 2008). \n\nWhenever needed, the false discovery rate (FDR) control was employed to account for multiple testing \n\n(Verhoeven et al. 2005). The presence and frequency of null alleles was tested for each locus using \n\nMICROCHECKER v.2.2.3 (van Oosterhout et al. 2004) and FREENA (Chapuis and Estoup 2007), \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 51 \n\n2.2.3. Genetic differentiation and population structure  \n\nPairwise FST estimates among populations were calculated using FSTAT v.2.9.3 (Goudet 1995), and \n\ndepartures of FST from the null hypothesis of panmixia were evaluated via a permutation test (1 000 \n\niterations). The effect of null alleles in FST estimates was assessed by comparing FST before and after \n\ncorrection for null alleles using the excluding null alleles (ENA) method implemented in FREENA. \n\nGenetic differentiation between populations was also determined using the Dest estimator (Jost 2008) \n\nimplemented in the R package DEMETICS v.0.8.4 (Gerlach et al. 2010), and P-values were estimated \n\nby bootstrap analysis (1 000 replicates). For all analyses involving multiple tests, significance levels \n\nwere adjusted by the FDR method. \n\nThe model-based approach implemented in STRUCTURE v.2.3.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000) was used to \n\nidentify the most likely number of populations (K) and assign individuals to genetic clusters. \n\nAssignment is conducted in ways that minimize deviations from Hardy\u2013Weinberg and linkage \n\nequilibrium within each cluster. No particular population structure was assumed a priori (LOCPRIOR = \n\n0), and ten independent runs were carried out for each value of K (1\u201311). Length of the burn-in period \n\nwas set to 1 \u00d7 105 followed by 5 \u00d7 105 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. Correlated allele \n\nfrequencies and admixed populations were assumed. Modifications in such parameters produced \n\nconsistency and did not change the final results. Selection of the most likely number of genetic \n\nclusters (K) was based on checking the posterior probability of the data for a given K (Pritchard et al. \n\n2000) and also by looking at the second-order rate of change in probability between successive K \n\nvalues as described in Evanno et al. (2005) and implemented in STRUCTURE HARVESTER (Earl \n\nand vonHoldt 2012). In systems with hierarchical population structure, STRUCTURE typically best \n\nresolves the highest level of population subdivision (Evanno et al. 2005). Thus, in order to resolve \n\nlower levels of subdivision, structure analyses were also conducted separately for each cluster \n\nidentified. Therefore, two additional STRUCTURE analyses using the same settings were used to \n\nidentify potential within-cluster structure. The best K was determined as previously described. \n\nA discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was also performed to identify and describe \n\nclusters of genetically related individuals (Jombart et al. 2010). DAPC has been shown to perform \n\ngenerally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision (Jombart et al. 2010). \n\nDAPC is a multivariate analysis that integrates principal component analysis (PCA) together with \n\ndiscriminant analysis to summarize genetic differentiation between groups. DAPC is free of \n\nassumptions about Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium or linkage disequilibrium and provides graphical \n\nrepresentation of divergence among populations. DAPC was performed with and without using prior \n\ngroup information using the R package ADEGENET (Jombart 2008). All STRUCTURE and DAPC \n\nanalyses were conducted upon removal of non-amplifying loci. \n\nTests for genetic differentiation among archipelagos were also conducted using analysis of molecular \n\nvariation (AMOVA) in ARLEQUIN v.3.5.1.3 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010). Genetic variation among \n\narchipelagos (FCT), among populations within archipelagos (FSC) and within populations (FST) was \n\nassessed, and significance of F-statistics was tested using 10 000 permutations. Estimates of genetic \n\n\n\n\t 52 \n\ndifferentiation were also determined among the \u201cfly\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d morphotypes of P. candei from \n\nAzores. \n\n \n\n2.2.4. Isolation by distance and gene flow \n\nTo test for isolation by distance (Wright 1943), linearized FST transformation (FST  / [1 ? FST]) was \n\nregressed onto the natural log of geographic distances (GD; Rousset 1997). Regression with GD was \n\nalso performed with the differentiation estimator Dest matrix. Regression analyses were performed in R \n\nand tested for significance with a Mantel permutation procedure. Moreover, given the heterogeneous \n\nnature of samples, the Monmonier\u2019s maximum difference algorithm implemented in BARRIER v.2.2 \n\nwas used to highlight geographical features associated with genetic discontinuities among populations \n\n(see Manni et al. 2004 for method details). Analyses were conducted using pairwise FST values, and \n\nstatistical confidence for each identified barrier was evaluated using 100 bootstrap replicates that were \n\nsimulated using the package diveRsity in R. Analyses were also conducted separately for each \n\namplifying microsatellite locus. \n\nRecent migration rates (m) among populations/clusters identified in STRUCTURE were estimated \n\nusing the Bayesian multilocus genotyping procedure implemented in BAYESASS v.3.0 (Wilson and \n\nRannala 2003). Analyses were only conducted among archipelagos due to the lower accuracy of \n\nBAYESASS when migration rates are high and genetic differentiation is low (see section 3) (Faubet et \n\nal. 2007). The program was run for 3 \u00d7 106 MCMC iterations with sampling at every 1 000 iterations, of \n\nwhich 106 iterations were discarded as burn-in. Delta values for allele frequency, migration rate, and \n\ninbreeding were adjusted so that the accepted numbers of changes were 40% \u2013 60% of the total \n\nnumber of iterations. Ten MCMC runs with different initial seeds were carried out in order to maximize \n\nconvergence and mixing. The Bayesian deviance was used as an optimality criterion to find the run \n\nwith the best fit (Faubet et al. 2007). Deviance was calculated from the trace file using the R-script \n\nprovided by Meirmans (2014). \n\nContemporary gene flow was also estimated using the F-model on BIMr program (Faubet and \n\nGaggiotti 2008). This software can estimate migration rates and detect migrants (within the last \n\ngeneration) at a lower level of population differentiation compared to BAYESASS (Faubet and \n\nGaggiotti 2008). In addition, BIMr can identify the environmental factors that are more likely to explain \n\nthe observed patterns using a generalized linear model. The method employs a Bayesian approach \n\nand Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to make inferences of recent gene flows in \n\nsubdivided populations (Faubet and Gaggiotti 2008). Preliminary trials included all populations but \n\nbecause population-specific FST values below 0.01 can be problematic for parameter estimation, \n\nanalyses were performed on samples grouped according to the Bayesian clustering analyses results. \n\nAlso, analyses were conducted with and without removing loci that failed to amplify in some \n\npopulations and/or exhibited null alleles. Often considered one of the main factors in determining gene \n\nflow in many species, the geographic distance between samples was included as the environmental \n\nvariable. A total of 20 independent replicate runs were performed. Each MCMC was run for a total of \n\n3.53 \u00d7 106 iterations, which included 30 short pilot runs of 1 000 iterations each in an effort to obtain \n\n\n\n\t 53 \n\nacceptance rates between 25% and 45%. The next 15 \u00d7 105 iterations were discarded as burn-in, and \n\na total of 20 000 samples were collected from each of the 20 replicates using a thinning interval of 100 \n\niterations, using default settings. The posterior probabilities were evaluated for the run with the lowest \n\nBayesian deviance (given by the assignment component of the total deviance: Dassign) (Faubet et al. \n\n2007; Faubet and Gaggiotti 2008). The mean, mode (point estimate), and 95% highest posterior \n\ndensity intervals (HPDI) for migration rates were recorded. \n\n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1. Distance-based morphometrics \n\nShell samples of P. candei ranged in size (SL) between 1.35 and 6.35 cm, with a mean size of 3.25 \u00b1 \n\n0.03 cm (mean \u00b1 SE). Although variable across islands (ANOVA, P &lt;0.001), mean SL did not differ \n\namong archipelagos (ANOVA, P > 0.05, Fig. S2, Table S1) but was significantly correlated with the \n\nremaining distance measures (SW, SWA, SAA, and SH) and also with BE (Table S2). Hence, only SL \n\nwas used for analyses and considered as a covariate in the analysis of spatial variation of BE. Among \n\nthe morphometric descriptors, conicity (CO) was positively correlated with BEC and CE and was \n\ntherefore selected for analysis together with BE. Significant variation in the shape, as given by \n\nanalyses of the descriptors CO and BE, was found at the scale of islands and among archipelagos \n\n(ANOVA, P &lt;0.05, Tables S3 and S4). Variation in shell BE among archipelagos, although affected \n\nby size (SL), was relatively higher than variation among islands (Fig. 2). Similarly, for conicity, the \n\nlargest proportion of the variability was found at the scale of archipelagos (Fig. 2). The first principal \n\ncomponent (PC1) described 62.2% of the total variation, with the remaining variation (%) being \n\naccounted by the second principal component (PC2). The most important variable integrated by the \n\nfirst and second components was conicity and BE, respectively. The PCA showed that shell conicity \n\ncan better distinguished shells from different archipelagos, whereas shell BE was mostly associated \n\nwith differences within archipelagos (Fig. 3). Significant shell shape variation was also detected \n\nbetween the two P. candei morphotypes in Azores (ANOVA, P &lt;0.01). Differences were only detected \n\nfor shell conicity, with \u201cfly limpets\u201d being more conical then \u201csmooth limpets.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Geometric morphometrics \n\nThe Procrustes ANOVA analysis on the full shell shape dataset revealed a significant interaction \n\nbetween archipelago and size, indicating an allometric growth in P. candei (Table 1). Moreover, the \n\nnull hypothesis for common allometries (parallel slopes) among archipelagos was rejected (F = 5.364, \n\nP &lt;0.001). The amount of shape change per unit of size change differed among archipelagos and \n\nwas greater in Azores (indicated by the lengths of slope vectors) (Table 1; Fig. S3). Yet, shape \n\ntrajectories and the way shapes change were only significantly different between Canaries and \n\nMadeira (indicated by the angles between slope vectors) (Table 1; Fig. S3). This corresponds to \n\ncontrasting local deformations in particular parts of the landmark configuration associated with size \n\nchange in these two archipelagos (e.g. note the changes in the shell apex landmark in Madeira and \n\nCanaries; Fig. S4). Significant differences in shell shape unrelated to size were detected among \n\narchipelagos for the two subsets (SMALL and BIG; Table S5). For both datasets, pairwise \n\ncomparisons showed that Azorean and Canaries shells could not be distinguished (Table S5). The \n\nfirst two principal components of the Procrustes shape variables for each dataset accounted for 52 \n\nand 53% of the total sample variation, respectively (Fig. 4). A generalized overlapping in the scatter of \n\ndata was found, mostly between Azores and Canaries samples. Intraspecific variance was greatest in \n\nsmaller shells from Madeira and Canaries, with individuals from these archipelagos occupying a much \n\nwider range of shape space than samples from Azores. Deformation grids for both SMALL and BIG \n\ndatasets indicate that shell goes from a clear round shape to a more ridged and pointy look-alike \n\nshape along CV1 (left to right) (Fig. 4). On the same direction, the shell apex gets closer to the \n\nanterior margin of the shell. Similarly, the anterior end of the shell gets narrower along such axis. \n\nThese shape changes are mostly associated and illustrate shell shape differences between \n\nAzores/Canaries and the Madeira samples. Whereas Azorean shells are oval with a smoother margin, \n\nthe Canaries samples exhibit some ridges along their shell border. The pentagon look-alike shape of \n\nP. candei in Madeira stands out from the remaining archipelagos (Fig. S5). As for shell shape variation \n\nbetween P. candei morphotypes (\u201cfly\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d) from Azores, the Procrustes ANOVA analysis \n\nrevealed a significant interaction between morphotype and size, which is indicative of allometric \n\ngrowth. The null hypothesis for common allometries (parallel slopes) among morphotypes was \n\nFigure 3.

Overall shape of P. candei in Azores is oval for both morphotypes but the shell apex in \n\n\u201cfly\u201d limpets tends to get closer to the anterior margin of the shell (Fig. S6). \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Genetic analysis \n\nA total of 138 alleles were observed across the 12 loci examined, ranging from six in CAN26 and \n\nCAN56 to 22 alleles in CAN18 (Table S7). Five loci failed to amplify in individuals from Madeira and \n\nCanaries: Loci CAN9, CAN26, and CAN33 did not amplify at all in these two populations and two \n\nadditional loci failed to amplify in more than 30% of both samples (Table S8). Since microsatellite \n\nmarkers were developed using P. candei from the Azores (see Faria et al. 2016), such amplification \n\nfailure suggests a high genetic differentiation between Azores and the remaining archipelagos. \n\nMultilocus mean allelic richness with rarefaction was similar across populations and ranged from 3.6 \n\n(GCA) and 4.7 (FAI). Mean number of private alleles was greater in the MAD population (AP[30] = \n\n1.14). Observed heterozygosity frequencies (HO) were relatively low and ranged from 0.157 to 0.364, \n\nwhile expected (HE) heterozygosity frequencies ranged from 0.304 to 0.484 (Table S7). No significant \n\nlinkage disequilibrium was detected for any pairs of loci. Except for loci CAN23 and CAN53, all other \n\nloci deviated from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Significant locus-specific inbreeding \n\ncoefficients (FIS) ranged from 0.073 to 0.746 denoting a heterozygous deficit in such loci. Overall, \n\nsignificant FIS values were often ascribed with the presence of null alleles. To check for any bias in the \n\nresults, loci with a presence of null alleles > 10% were removed from the analysis. Such removal did \n\nnot affect genetic differentiation results (data not shown) and unless stated otherwise, all loci were \n\nincluded in subsequent genetic analyses. In fact, the influence of null alleles has been shown to be \n\nmarginal when compared to other factors such as number of loci and strength of population \n\ndifferentiation (Carlsson 2008). Pairwise comparisons of FST and Dest indicated high and significant \n\ngenetic differences among archipelagos but not within archipelago (i.e., between islands in Azores) \n\n(Table 2). Both indices were highly correlated (Pearson\u2019s correlation 0.99, P &lt;0.001) (Fig. S7). \n\nFurthermore, FST values before and after correction for null alleles using the ENA method did not differ \n\nconsiderably (Table S9). \n\n \n\nTable 2. Pairwise estimates of FST-FREENA (below diagonal) and Jost\u2019s Dest (above diagonal) between all populations sampled for \n\nPatella candei (see Fig. 1 for population codes)  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 57 \n\nThe STRUCTURE and DAPC analyses provided support for the genetic differentiation indicated by \n\nFST and Dest. In fact, the genetic structure inferred from the 560 individuals of P. candei and the 12 \n\nmicrosatellite loci using the Bayesian model-based clustering algorithm, and the model-free DAPC \n\nclustering algorithm, provided similar results (Fig. 5). Two clusters (K = 2) were identified when \n\nconsidering all locations, with Azores samples being separated from the Madeira and Canaries \n\npopulations. Similarly, two well-defined clusters were retrieved on the Madeira and Canaries \n\nassignment analysis. Both STRUCTURE and DAPC also suggested population homogeneity for P. \n\ncandei in Azores (K = 1). In this case, for the STRUCTURE analysis, the estimated membership of \n\nindividuals to any given cluster was roughly symmetric (~1/K in each population), indicating that \n\nindividuals in Azores are widely admixed and belong to a single panmictic population (Fig. 5). Results \n\nfrom the Bayesian clustering analysis and DAPC were consistent with those obtained using AMOVA, \n\nwhich detected significant genetic differences among archipelagos. According to the AMOVA, 36.6% \n\nof the total genetic variation was found among archipelagos (P &lt;0.001), 0.2% among populations of \n\nthe same archipelago (P = 0.268), and 63.1% within populations (P &lt;0.001). Furthermore, a \n\nsignificant positive relationship was observed between genetic differentiation estimators (FST and Dest) \n\nand geographic distance (Fig. 6). However, such relationship (IBD) is only endorsed among \n\narchipelagos and not within archipelago (i.e. populations from Azores are genetically undistinguished) \n\n(Fig. 6). The Monmonier\u2019s algorithm in BARRIER revealed the existence of strong spatial barriers to \n\nFigure 5.

Yet, from the individual assignments, two \n\nindividuals sampled in Madeira had posterior probability estimates (0.13 and 0.44, respectively) as \n\nsecond-generation migrants from Canaries. One individual sampled in the Canaries had a probability \n\nof 0.24 to be a first-generation migrant from Madeira (Table S10). Estimates of current gene flow rates \n\nfrom BIMr for populations of P. candei were consistent across all preliminary trials and runs and \n\nshowed mean values very close to 0 (Table 3). Such small estimates suggest effectively the absence \n\nof contemporary gene exchange among archipelagos. Moreover, the highest posterior probability was \n\nassigned to the model excluding distance as a factor (P[none] = 57.3; P[distance] = 42.7). The observed \n\nmigration rates were independent of geographic distance as migration between archipelagos was \n\nsimilar and virtually absent. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Discussion \n\nHere, we investigate current signs of population differentiation and connectivity in the P. candei \n\ncomplex across Macaronesia (NE Atlantic). Our results revealed highly structured populations among \n\narchipelagos, which are likely associated with strong barriers to gene flow. Although isolation by \n\ndistance (IBD) was detected among archipelagos, connectivity within archipelago (i.e. Azores) does \n\nnot follow IBD, with genetic homogeneity among populations (i.e. islands) being maintained possibly \n\nvia broad larval exchange. Moreover, shell shape differences among archipelagos were also detected \n\nand are likely the consequence of mixed effects of historical vicariance and re-colonization events, \n\ngenetic drift, and local adaptations. \n\nLimitations to this study include the lack of samples from some Macaronesia islands (i.e., no samples \n\nfrom Selvagens and single samples from Canaries and Madeira), so that results among archipelagos \n\ncannot be fully explored in comparison with patterns within archipelagos. Despite this shortcome, the \n\ninclusion of samples from Madeira and Canaries allowed showing that the Patella candei complex \n\nacross Macaronesia is highly differentiated and that each subspecies (or species) endorsed to a given \n\narchipelago should be treated as a single conservation unit. \n\n\n\n\t 60 \n\n \n\n4.1. Shell shape variation between archipelagos \n\nThere have been few attempts to describe and distinguish limpet species and/or morphotypes using \n\nshell morphometry (e.g. Denny 2000; Cabral 2007). The difficulties of such methods rely on the fact \n\nthat limpet shells have a sub-oval shape without any clear external homologous landmarks (except for \n\nthe shell apex) or readily identifiable morphological features. Furthermore, due to the strong influence \n\nof certain environmental factors (i.e. wave exposure, substrate complexity, predation) many \n\norganisms, including limpets, exhibit high morphological plasticity (Branch and Marsh 1978; Lowell \n\n1986; Sokolova and Berger 2000; Guerra-Varela et al. 2009; Harley et al. 2009). The advent of \n\nmodern techniques such as geometric morphometrics has furthered the ability of researchers to \n\ndifferentiate species and or specimens based on morphological characters (e.g. Baylac et al. 2003; \n\nRuane 2015; Davis et al.  2016). In such sense, whereas distance-based methods are considered \n\nrather more simplistic in detecting shape differences between samples, the geometric analysis allows \n\na more detailed recognition and assessment of how such shape varies with shell growth. Despite \n\nintrinsic different, generally, both methods allowed to distinguish P. candei morphotypes among and \n\nwithin archipelagos. The differences found between both methods are likely associated to (1) the fact \n\nthat distance-based data contain relatively little information about shape because many of the \n\nmeasurements overlap and/or are correlated to each other, and shape can only be derived from ratios \n\namong particular measurements and (2) the inclusion of shell height to the distance-based method \n\nprovides a third dimension, which is absent in geometric morphometrics that only considers a two-\n\ndimensional reduction of shape in current analyses. Depicting the results, distance-based methods \n\nshow that samples from Azores exhibit a more conical and elliptical shell shape compared to samples \n\nfrom the Canaries and Madeira, with the later descriptor being influenced by size. In fact, shell shape \n\nallometries derived from geometric morphometrics differ among archipelagos, and globally, \n\ndifferences are mostly found between Madeira samples and the remaining archipelagos; both small \n\nand large limpets from Azores and Canaries are more similar between them than with samples from \n\nMadeira. Whereas genetic data suggest a closer relationship between P. candei from Madeira and \n\nCanaries populations (see sections 3 and 4), shell shape differences are more thinned between P. \n\ncandei from Azores and Canaries. This variation in morphology does not need to be necessarily \n\nconsistent with genetic variation, especially because neutral markers such as microsatellites can be \n\nsubject to distinct evolutionary forces than selected loci (McKay and Latta 2002). \n\nShell shape variation in P. candei among archipelagos seems to be associated with mixed effects of \n\nancient vicariance events, genetic drift and particular local adaptations under restrictive gene flow that \n\nacted together to produce such dissimilarities. For instance, the genetic stochasticity associated with \n\ndistinct evolutionary histories such as time of colonization in each archipelago and/or specific \n\nretraction and expansion demographic events under limited gene flow may have contributed to the \n\nobserved morphological variation. These mechanisms are likely responsible for the occurrence of \n\nseveral patellid species with considerable differentiation in shell shape on similar habitats across \n\nMacaronesia. For example, in Madeira, P. candei and Patella piperata have an overlapping intertidal \n\n\n\n\t 61 \n\ndistribution, even though the shell of P. piperata is more round shaped and exhibits small black \n\ngranules along its shell. Historical and/or contemporary diverging local selection pressures, and subtle \n\ndifferences in temperatures, hydrodynamic forces, substrate composition, community assemblages, \n\nand available competitors among archipelagos are also likely to have played a key role in determining \n\nvariation in limpet shell shape on such remote islands. Moreover, the adaptive phenotypic plasticity \n\nassociated with multiple environmental conditions, which is common in many intertidal molluscs (e.g. \n\nWolf et al. 1997; Trussell 2000), can also determine geographic variation. Within the Azorean \n\narchipelago, such phenotypic plasticity is evident in the two well-recognized habitat morphs: The \u201cfly \n\nlimpet\u201d which is highly conical and commonly found upper on the shore, mostly on more rugose \n\nsurfaces; and the \u201csmooth limpet\u201d which is more flattened and associated to surfaces highly exposed \n\nto hydrodynamic forces (Hawkins et al. 1990). Under particular circumstances, such phenotypic \n\nplasticity can set the baseline for sympatric speciation and evolutionary divergence of habitat morphs \n\n(see Agrawal 2001). In fact, environmental stress gradients in coastal intertidal habitats related to \n\nheat, desiccation, salinity, and wave action can provide the adequate setting for adaptive processes in \n\npatellids (Branch 1981). If reproductive isolation is enforced by the ecological characteristics of each \n\nhabitat, then biological separated species can be revealed. A good example comes from the \n\ndiversification in Nacella limpets in the Magellanic Province (South America) (Gonz\u00e1lez-Wevar et al. \n\n2011). Ecological speciation and restricting levels of gene flow resulting from ecologically based \n\ndivergent selection are considered the main driving processes of such diversification. The possibility of \n\nspeciation along ecological gradients, without the need of a complete allopatric isolation, has also \n\nbeen shown for the Hawaiian endemic limpets of the genus Cellana (Bird et al. 2011). \n\n \n\n4.2. Population genetic structure and contemporary connectivity \n\nGenetic differentiation estimates among archipelagos revealed a highly structured pattern in the P. \n\ncandei complex across Macaronesia. Populations of P. candei from Azores are the most isolated and \n\nexhibit the highest level of differentiation from the remaining archipelagos. To a lesser extent, \n\npopulations from Madeira and Canaries, which are about 400 km apart, also show significant genetic \n\ndifferentiation and limited contemporary connectivity. In fact, migratory events between Madeira and \n\nCanaries are unlikely, if not entirely absent, despite the fact that these archipelagos are geographically \n\ncloser to each other. Only three individuals showed a very slightly probability of being migrants \n\nbetween these two archipelagos. Selvagens islands, which stand at approximately two-thirds of the \n\nway between Madeira and the Canary Islands, and could act as a putative stepping stone for gene \n\nflow requires further examination. As for Azores, despite the wide geographical distribution of its \n\nislands across (~ 600 km), the minimum and maximum distances among any pair of adjacent islands \n\nthat pelagic larvae must travel among islands are approximately 32 and 220 km, respectively. Such \n\ndistances do not seem to offer an obstacle and allow populations\u2019 gene pool across all islands to be \n\nhomogenized via larval transport. Although genetic differentiation among archipelagos seems to be \n\nhighly correlated with geographic distance, the unbalanced nature of sampling, the fact that \n\nconnectivity within archipelago (i.e. Azores) does not follow IBD, and the results provided by \n\n\n\n\t 62 \n\nBARRIER (see Fig. 7) and BIMr analyses, suggest that the most likely barriers to gene flow in P. \n\ncandei across the Macaronesia archipelagos are also associated to historical and contemporary \n\nlimitations imposed by the masses of water that separate them, and are not a direct result of the \n\ngeographical distance per se. In this case, the historical shifting of ocean circulation processes and \n\nthe current oceanographic complexity and mesoscale variability across Macaronesia, with meanders, \n\nhigh eddy kinetic energy, upwellings, and several masses with distinct thermohaline characteristics \n\n(see Johnson and Stevens 2000; Alves et al. 2002; Rogerson et al. 2004), may have acted as a strong \n\nphysical barriers to gene exchange among archipelagos. Such barriers to gene flow, however, cannot \n\nfully exclude limitative dispersal across space or IBD pattern in P. candei throughout Macaronesia. Not \n\nonly larval mortality rates increase almost exponentially as they move away from the coast into \n\noffshore waters (Cowen et al. 2000), but the PLD of P. candei may also be shorter than expected, or \n\nof a narrower range of what is generally referred for other patellids (Ribeiro 2008). Under such \n\nscenario, because larvae are less likely to travel longer distances, populations farther away from each \n\nother would be more genetically distinct. \n\nThe failure of some microsatellites, which were isolated from the genome of P. candei samples from \n\nAzores, in amplifying individuals from Madeira and Canaries may further suggest substantial genetic \n\nbreak among archipelagos. The reduced marker polymorphism in southern samples may reflect \n\npronounced sequence differences among subspecies due to their genetic divergence, thus entailing \n\nan upward ascertainment bias as markers were developed from Azorean morphotypes. This may \n\nexplain the contrasting results of this study and those provided by S\u00e1-Pinto et al. (2005, 2008). In their \n\nstudy, samples from Azores and Madeira grouped together in a well-supported clade, leaving \n\nCanaries more distant related. According to the same authors, the scenario of a single colonization \n\nevent for each archipelago associated with the absence of historical gene flow between them is the \n\nmost likely. The direction and timing of such colonization events is still unclear, and methods such as \n\nthe approximate Bayesian computation (Beaumont et al. 2002) may be useful in contrasting \n\ndemographic hypothesis about the evolutionary history of limpets in Macaronesia, provided that all \n\narchipelagos are sampled (including Selvagens). Even so, it seems plausible to accept that upon a \n\nsingle event of colonization, limpet populations in each archipelago remained isolated and \n\nevolved/adapted allopatrically to the environmental specificities of each archipelago. It is thought that \n\nP. candei candei from the Selvagens islands is the ancestral species that first colonized the Canaries \n\nand Madeira and only later the Azores (Weber and Hawkins 2002; S\u00e1-Pinto et al. 2008). This \n\nevolutionary pattern tracks each archipelago\u2019s time of origin with Selvagens being the oldest (~ 29.5 \n\nMa) and Azores the youngest (&lt;6 Ma), but the exact sequence of colonization is still unresolved. \n\nChanges in sea level and ocean circulation associated with major historical episodes such as the \n\ntectonic closure of the Isthmus of Panama (Haug and Tiedemann 1998), the Plio-Pleistocene glacial \n\ncycles (Maggs et al. 2008), and the closing off of the western basin of the Mediterranean from the \n\nAtlantic (Krijgsman et al. 1999) may have contributed to the expansion and allopatric differentiation of \n\nP. candei throughout Macaronesia. As suggested for the endemic Macaronesia periwinkle Tectarius \n\nstriatus (den Broeck et al. 2008), P. candei may have colonized Macaronesia in periods when sea \n\nlevels were lower, so that seamounts peaked above sea level and acted as stepping stones between \n\n\n\n\t 63 \n\narchipelagos. Therefore, adaptive processes associated with niche differentiation and \n\nphysical/geographical isolation among populations may correspond to the underlying mechanisms for \n\nP. candei diversification in Macaronesia. In the absence of gene flow between populations, \n\nreproductive isolation would arise gradually as a result of mutation, genetic drift and natural selection \n\ndriven by differences in local environmental conditions (Hoskins et al. 2005). In fact, allopatric \n\nspeciation under restrictive gene flow is believed to be one of the most common modes of speciation \n\nin nature (Schluter 2009). Yet, providing that reproductive isolation is complete, secondary events of \n\ncolonization followed by the weakening of physical/ geographical barriers are not to be excluded and, \n\nfor instance, may have contributed to the coexistence of P. candei candei (the Selvagens ecotype) \n\nand P. candei crenata in Canaries islands; although isolated specimens of P. candei candei were \n\nidentified in El Hierro and Tenerife islands, this co-occurrence is now mainly restricted to a single \n\nisland: Fuerteventura (Gonz\u00e1lez-Lorenzo et al. 2016). \n\n \n\n4.3. Conservation of limpet population in Macaronesia \n\nThe aim of conservation is not simply to safeguard species from going extinct, but also to guarantee \n\nthat morphological and genetic variation in natural populations is preserved. Efforts toward ensuring \n\nthe conservation of limpet populations in Macaronesia are highly recommended, especially \n\nconsidering that their low genetic diversity and lack of gene exchange between archipelagos suggest \n\nthey may be highly vulnerable. Taking into account its endemic nature and the negative impact of \n\nover-exploitation in coastal communities, the risk of complete extinction of P. candei in Macaronesia is \n\ntherefore conceivable. Yet, because our study failed to detect the occurrence of population \n\nbottlenecks, which would be expected under the known demographic decline of P. candei in \n\nMacaronesia, the effective population sizes must be still large enough to prevent critical losses to \n\ngenetic variability (see Pujolar et al. 2011). However, when comparing to unexploited populations of \n\npatellids elsewhere (e.g. Perez et al. 2007; Ribeiro et al. 2010), genetic diversity in the P. candei \n\ncomplex is fairly low. Despite the challenges associated with such comparisons, especially because \n\ndifferent microsatellite loci may generate different levels of variation, the reduced genetic diversity \n\nobserved can be a consequence of high levels of population inbreeding caused by intensive \n\nexploitation. As harvesting is mainly aimed at larger individuals (Martins et al. 2008), the more fertile \n\nindividuals with higher reproductive outputs are likely less abundant than expected. This may lead to \n\nsevere evolutionary and ecological consequences for the biology, life-history traits, and survival of the \n\nspecies (Fenberg and Roy 2008). \n\nOur results support the view that populations from each archipelago should be managed for \n\nconservation as distinct units. Within the P. candei complex, P. candei candei is considered in danger \n\nof extinction under the Spanish Catalogue of Endangered Species and is now mainly restricted to one \n\nsingle island: Fuerteventura (Canary Islands). This is likely a consequence of overexploitation (N\u00fa\u00f1ez \n\net al. 2003), but selective and evolutionary-related processes may have also been involved (Gonz\u00e1lez-\n\nLorenzo et al. 2016). Recently, a forced ban to its capture and a conservational plan has been put in \n\nplace by regional authorities. Aside from Fuerteventura, P. candei candei occurs more abundantly in \n\n\n\n\t 64 \n\nthe Selvagens, uninhabitable islands that are protected under the Portuguese status of Nature \n\nReserve. As for the remaining limpets, each Regional authority has established protective measures \n\nand rules for their harvesting. Legislation does not differ much among regions, with the establishment \n\nof limpet no-take areas, minimum legal catch sizes, and seasonal fishing closures. Unfortunately, \n\nthese actions have been largely ineffective in protecting such resource (Martins et al. 2011; L\u00f3pez et \n\nal. 2012; Diogo et al. 2016; Riera et al. 2016), mostly because of illegal harvesting and lack of or \n\ninsufficient enforcement. Protective measures need to be adjusted to the particular life-history traits of \n\nP. candei in each archipelago (e.g. temporal variation in reproduction, recruitment, population \n\ndynamics). Furthermore, both environmental awareness programs to general population and coastal \n\nenforcement by local authorities should be stimulated. Above all, we suggest the establishment of fully \n\nenforced closed zones to limit the access to rocky shore poachers and allow limpet populations to \n\ngrow in numbers and individual sizes. These off-limit areas should be regularly surveyed and take into \n\nconsideration population connectivity patterns within archipelagos. Our data suggest that, at least for \n\nAzores, such areas should distance no more than ~ 200 km, to allow proper gene exchange between \n\npopulations. Additional sampling throughout all Macaronesia islands can further sharpen our \n\nknowledge about connectivity patterns in P. candei and help better defining the establishment of such \n\nareas within each archipelago. \n\nUnder the very probable assumption that P. candei from each archipelago forms a geographically \n\nand/or ecologically isolated population, the various subspecies within the P. candei complex as \n\npreviously proposed by Christiaens (1973) may be best thought as true species using the \n\ndenomination: Patella candei in Selvagens, Patella gomesii in Azores, Patella ordinaria in Madeira, \n\nand Patella crenata for Canaries. Whether this would facilitate current taxonomic misinterpretations \n\nand conservation needs, further research is still required, especially in diagnosing intrinsic \n\nreproductive isolation (Frankham et al. 2012). Ultimately, this elevation of subspecies to species level \n\nwould be in agreement with stock delimitation and units of conservation (Hawkins et al. 2016) with \n\npotential benefits for management plans aimed at the preservation of limpets stocks across the \n\nMacaronesia region. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nWe sincerely thank two anonymous reviewers for their useful comments that improved significantly \n\nthis manuscript.

The Macaronesia (NE Atlantic) endemic \n\nlimpet Patella aspera (R\u00f6ding 1798) has been subject to overexploitation throughout its geographic \n\ndistribution. We analysed 841 limpet specimens from eleven islands across the archipelagos of \n\nAzores, Madeira and Canaries. Results from 11 nuclear microsatellite markers showed significant \n\npopulation structure between populations from Azores and populations from Madeira and Canaries, \n\nand absence of current or historic gene flow between these. M-ratios showed that both population \n\nclusters have experienced demographic changes over time. Heterozygote deficits were common \n\nacross populations, which can be better accounted for by inbreeding than by null alleles or Wahlund \n\neffect. Such levels of inbreeding are likely a consequence of a significant reduction of reproductive \n\nunits due to decades of intensive exploitation. As a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite, the size-\n\nselective harvesting of larger individuals likely fosters unbalanced sex-ratios and a consequent \n\nreproductive shortage. A recent compensatory hypothesis suggests that males are compensating the \n\nremoval of larger females by undergoing sex change earlier and presumably at smaller sizes, as an \n\nadaptive response of the species under high size-biased fishing pressure. Despite such response, a \n\ndramatic reduction of Ne emerging from a large variation in the reproductive success due to \n\noverfishing and artificial genetic drift, can simply explain the inbreeding scenario observed in this \n\nMacaronesia endemic key species. This study provides valuable insights for management and \n\nconservation of P. aspera throughout Macaronesia. \n\n  \n\nKEYWORDS: connectivity, endemism, genetic erosion, over-exploitation, population genetics, sex-\n\nratio  \n\n \n\n \n\nPublished as: \n\nFaria J, Pita A, Martins GM, Ribeiro PA, Hawkins SJ, Presa P, Neto AI (2017) Inbreeding in the \n\nexploited limpet Patella aspera across the Macaronesia archipelagos (NE Atlantic): Implications for \n\nconservation. Fisheries Research 198: 180-188. DOI: 10.1016/j.fishres.2017.09.003 \n\n\n\n\t 84 \n\n1. Introduction \n\nThe most obvious consequences of living resources uptake by humans are the reduction of the \n\ntargeted population size and biomass (e.g. Christensen et al. 2014). Fisheries research has long \n\nprovided examples of such disruptive impacts on natural systems (Hutchings and Reynolds 2004). At \n\nthe population-level, fishing can alter size structure and population parameters in response to changes \n\nin species abundance (e.g. Jennings et al. 1999; Genner et al. 2010). Selective fisheries can also shift \n\nthe community composition and the dynamics of an entire ecosystem, with known cascading effects \n\non other taxa and biota (e.g. McClanahan et al. 1996; Myers et al. 2007; Casini et al. 2008; Smith et \n\nal. 2011). Moreover, the mean trophic level targeted by global fisheries has been decreasing over \n\nrecent decades, shifting from large piscivorous fishes to smaller invertebrates and planktivorous \n\nfishes, leading to major changes in the structure of marine food webs (Pauly et al. 1998; Jackson et al. \n\n2001). \n\nLess noticeable are the genetic changes brought about by exploitation. These include the genetic \n\nsubdivision of populations and the loss of genetic variation, which are thought to increase the risk of \n\nextinction via reductions in resilience and ability to recover following anthropogenic disturbances \n\n(Allendorf et al. 2008; Pinsky and Palumbi 2014). In fact, fisheries-induced genetic changes are known \n\nto affect a number of life-history traits that often reduce the capacity for a population to recover. For \n\nexample, the most usual size-selective fishing for larger individuals can negatively affect traits such as \n\nfecundity, maturation and larval growth in many marine organisms (Walsh et al. 2006; Swain et al. \n\n2007).  \n\nAs many other fisheries, the removal of limpets has a profound impact on the ecosystem. It is known \n\nthat grazing by limpets not only determines macroalgal biomass overall (Hawkins et al. 1992), but also \n\nmodifies ecosystem stability (Coleman et al. 2006). In fact, current dominance of intertidal algal turfs \n\non many islands of Macaronesia is largely attributed to the virtual absence of patellid species due to \n\noverharvesting (Martins et al. 2008). Moreover, algal dominance means that there is little bare rock left \n\nfor the settlement of new limpet recruits. \n\nThe most economically valuable limpet species across the region is Patella aspera (R\u00f6ding 1798), \n\nwhich is present in all Macaronesia archipelagos with the exception of Cape Verde, and occurs on \n\nrocky shores from the lower intertidal down to 20 m depth. P. aspera is a protandrous (sequential \n\nhermaphrodite) species with external fertilization, that reaches sexual maturity around 40 mm in shell \n\nlength (Martins et al. 1987). In such species, individuals start as males, with the majority switching \n\nlater in life to female. P. aspera is more reproductively active during winter/ early spring months with \n\nsummer defined as a gonad maturation resting period (Martins et al. 1987; Vale 2016). Gametes are \n\nreleased into the water column and, upon fertilization, competent larvae can spend between to 2 to 32 \n\ndays before they settle on hard substrate. These are temperature-dependent estimates that have \n\nbeen determined for other patellid species and may not reflect the true pelagic larvae duration of P. \n\naspera (see Ribeiro 2008). P. aspera is assumed to have speciated from its congeneric European \n\ncontinental form Patella ulyssiponensis (Koufopanou et al. 1999; Weber and Hawkins 2005) probably \n\nbetween 8 - 4 Ma (S\u00e1-Pinto et al. 2008). Lack of gene flow between insular and continental \n\n\n\n\t 85 \n\npopulations, presumably after the establishment of extant ocean current patterns following the uplift of \n\nPanama isthmus, has made P. aspera more vulnerable to exploitation.  \n\nA key challenge of fisheries management is the correct definition of effective stocks (Hawkins et al. \n\n2016). This is vital to ensure that natural resources and the fishery are managed at the appropriate \n\nspatial scale. Although the reliability of such definition may be better achieved by using multiple stock \n\nidentification techniques concurrently (e.g. see holistic approach in Begg and Waldman 1999), \n\nmolecular procedures have been more recently used to provide a genetic basis for aiding in stock \n\nidentification (e.g. Griffiths et al. 2010; Dann et al. 2013). Moreover, molecular data can allow the \n\nunderstanding of the way populations in different geographic regions are connected via larval transfer \n\nor isolated from one another. In the event that connectivity exists among Macaronesia archipelagos, \n\nP. aspera could still maintain enough potential for local sustainability, provided that depleted stocks \n\ncould be enhanced by natural gene flow from adjacent and/or more distant populations. However, \n\nexperimental knowledge on such connectivity remains largely unknown so far. Here we used \n\nmolecular data to identify patterns of genetic diversity and to test the null hypothesis of spatially \n\nhomogeneous interbreeding and gene flow in P. aspera across Macaronesia, by studying the degree \n\nof genetic divergence between putative populations. We discuss possible implications of this study for \n\nfisheries management and conservation of such biologically, culturally and economically important \n\nendemic species across the region. \n\n \n\n2. Methods \n\n2.1. Sampling and laboratory procedures \n\nA total of 841 individuals of P. aspera were collected across the Macaronesia archipelagos of Azores, \n\nMadeira and Canaries (Fig. 1). Individuals were labelled, and foot tissue samples were collected and \n\npreserved in 96% ethanol. Genomic DNA was extracted from muscle tissue using the E.Z.N.A. \n\nMollusc DNA extraction kit following manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Omega Bio-tek). All DNA samples \n\nwere quantified and checked for purity in a NanoDropTM spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). \n\nSeventeen species-specific polymorphic microsatellite markers were amplified with fluorescently \n\nlabelled primers following the PCR conditions described in Faria et al. (2015) (see Supplementary \n\nMaterial for methodological details).  \n\n \n\n2.2. Genetic diversity \n\nStandard genetic diversity measures such as allele frequencies, expected (HE) and observed (HO) \n\nheterozygosities and inbreeding coefficients (FIS) within populations for each locus and over all loci \n\nwere calculated using GENALEX v.6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2012). Deviations from Hardy\u2013Weinberg \n\nequilibrium (HWE) and genotypic linkage disequilibrium (LD) among all pairs of loci were tested using \n\nexact tests implemented in GENEPOP v.4.1 (Raymond and Rousset 1995). Because loci involved in \n\nsignificant linkage disequilibrium tests were detected, all subsequent analyses were performed on a \n\n\n\n\t 86 \n\nreduced dataset of 11 loci. Allelic richness (AR) and private allelic richness (AP) were calculated in HP-\n\nRare (Kalinowski 2005) with a rarefaction sample size (in genes) of 10 due to missing data. Statistical \n\nsignificance for these parameters were tested with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in R v.3.3.0 (R Core \n\nTeam 2014). Results for multiple testing were adjusted by applying the false discovery rate (FDR) \n\ncorrection approach (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). As large heterozygote deficits are common in \n\nmarine invertebrates (Addison and Hart 2005), FREENA (Chapuis and Estoup 2007) was used to \n\ndetect the presence of null alleles and quantify their frequency. Evidence for null alleles can be found \n\nin deviations to HWE, more precisely in the significant excess frequency of homozygous genotypes. \n\nNeutrality of the markers was tested using LOSITAN software (Antao et al. 2008) (see Supplementary \n\nMaterial for methodological details). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Map of sampling locations for Patella aspera collected from the Macaronesia archipelagos of Azores, Madeira and \n\nCanaries (NE Atlantic).  \n\n \n\n2.3. Population structure \n\nGenetic differentiation among population was estimated from the pairwise FST using the so-called ENA \n\nmethod described in Chapuis and Estoup (2007). This approach aims to correct for the positive bias \n\ninduced by the presence of null alleles on FST estimation; 95% confidence intervals for the FST values \n\nwere obtained using 10 000 bootstrap iterations and FST estimates obtained with and without applying \n\nthe ENA algorithm were compared by means of a two tailed t-test. For comparative purposes, pairwise \n\nFST resulting from an analysis of molecular variance performed between each pair of populations \n\n(AMOVA) was also estimated in GENODIVE v.2.0b25 (Meirmans and van Tienderen 2004); statistical \n\nsignificance was tested by means of a permutation procedure across loci, followed by the FDR \n\n\n\n\t 87 \n\ncorrection for multiple testing. Genetic differentiation between populations was also determined using \n\nthe Dest estimator (Jost 2008) implemented in the R package DEMETICS v.0.8.4 (Gerlach et al. 2010) \n\nand P-values were estimated by bootstrap analysis (1 000 replicates). To test for isolation by distance \n\n(Wright 1943), linearized FST-ENA transformation (FST / [1- FST]) was regressed onto the natural \n\nlogarithm of geographic distance (GD) (Rousset 1997) in R and tested for significance with a Mantel \n\npermutation procedure. POWSIM v.4.0 (Ryman and Palm 2006) was used to determine the power of \n\nthe markers to detect significant genetic differentiation at various levels of FST (see Supplementary \n\nMaterial for methodological details). \n\nGenetic population structure was assessed using the Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in \n\nSTRUCTURE v.2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. 2000) (see Supplementary Material for methodological details). \n\nThe most likely number of K pools was selected using the ?K method described in Evanno et al. \n\n(2005) and implemented in STRUCTURE HARVESTER v.0.6.94 (Earl and vonHoldt 2012). The \n\nresults of ten replicate runs for each value of K (putative number of gene pools) from 1 to 11 were \n\naveraged in CLUMPP v.1.1.2 (Jakobsson and Rosenberg 2007) and summary outputs were displayed \n\ngraphically in DISTRUCT v.1.1 (Rosenberg 2004). Analyses were also conducted on a reduced \n\ndataset by excluding loci with a higher frequency of null alleles (e.g. Baums et al. 2012). Because the \n\nhigh frequency of null alleles at most loci and populations might lead to overestimation of the number \n\nof K pools, the robustness of STRUCTURE results was tested using another Bayesian inference \n\nmethod provided by GENELAND (Guillot et al. 2005) and implemented in R package (see \n\nSupplementary Material for methodological details). AMOVA as implemented in ARLEQUIN v.3.5.2.2 \n\n(Excoffier and Lischer 2010) was also used to characterize the genetic structure and variance within \n\nand between clusters identified in STRUCTURE and GENELAND analyses; significance was tested \n\nafter 1 000 permutations. Genetic diversity statistics were applied to each of the clusters identified with \n\nBayesian analyses of population structure. \n\n \n\n2.4. Unbiased estimates of inbreeding \n\nBecause homozygosity in P. aspera can be a consequence of harvesting-related inbreeding, the \n\nindividual inbreeding model (IIM) implemented in the software INEST v.2.0 (Chybicki and Burczyk \n\n2009) was used to simultaneously estimate null allele frequencies and inbreeding coefficients (fixation \n\nindex, FIS-INEST). This Bayesian approach allowed the calculation of unbiased estimates of inbreeding \n\nwithin a population after accounting for null alleles. Within INEST, two models were tested: firstly the \n\nfull model which accounts for genotyping failures (b), inbreeding (f) and null alleles (n) and secondly \n\nthe random mating model (i.e. when f is fixed at 0). The Deviation Information Criterion (DIC) is then \n\nused for model comparison. Support is given to an inbreeding effect when the lowest DIC is found in \n\nthe nfb model. Also, to evaluate the effect of null alleles on F-statistics, uncorrected FIS for each \n\npopulation was regressed onto the frequency of null alleles. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 88 \n\n2.5. Bottleneck detection and gene flow \n\nThe heterozygosity excess test in BOTTLENECK v.1.2.02 (Cornuet and Luikart 1996) was used to test \n\nfor evidence that populations had experienced recent genetic bottlenecks. Demographic declines were \n\nalso assessed for the inferred clusters using the M-ratio test as implemented in M_p_val (Garza and \n\nWilliamson 2001). Recent migration among clusters was estimated using the Bayesian assignment \n\ntest implemented in BAYESASS v.3.0 (Wilson and Rannala 2003). All bottleneck and migration \n\nanalyses were repeated after discarding loci with > 20% proportion of null alleles (see Dakin and Avise \n\n2004) (see Supplementary Material for bottleneck and migration analyses details). \n\n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1. Genetic diversity \n\nAll microsatellite loci were highly polymorphic with no significant differences in allelic richness among \n\npopulations (single locus AR ranging between 1.8 and 6.6; Table S1 and Table S2). Conversely, \n\nprivate allelic richness (AP) was significantly higher in the Canaries population (P &lt;0.05) in most \n\npairwise comparisons. Observed heterozygosity was relatively low and similar across populations with \n\na mean value of 0.309 \u00b1 0.165 SD (Table S1). The expected mean heterozygosity was 0.691 \u00b1 0.154 \n\nSD and all loci deviated from HWE. The estimated frequency of null alleles ranged from 0.07 to 0.36. \n\nThere was no evidence for selection at any locus (Fig. S1). \n\n \n\n3.2. Population structure \n\nSignificant genetic differentiation (after FDR correction) was found in 34 out of 55 pairwise FST-GENODIVE \n\ncomparisons (Table 1). FST-GENODIVE ranged from 0 to 0.114 and was not significantly different from FST-\n\nFREENA corrected for null alleles (t-test, P > 0.05). Higher values were mainly observed between Azores \n\nand Madeira plus Canaries. Dest estimates were proportionally higher than FST estimates and yielded \n\nsimilar statistical significance values (Table 1). \n\n \n\nTable 1. Pairwise estimates of FST-GENODIVE (above diagonal) and Jost\u2019s Dest (below diagonal) among Patella aspera populations \n\n(see Fig. 1 for population codes). Significant values after FDR correction are in bold.  \n\n\n\n\t 89 \n\n \n\nRegression analysis showed that F-statistics might have been highly overestimated in the presence of \n\nnull alleles (Fig. S2) and can therefore affect FST estimates and their significance among populations, \n\nespecially on those that are putatively more closely related such as the Azorean populations. Power \n\nanalysis in POWSIN indicated that the number of individuals and the number of loci used in this study \n\nprovide strong support to identify weak differentiation among populations at a true FST as low as \n\n0.0025 with a statistical power of 100% for both Fisher\u2019s exact test and the chi-square test. \n\nThere was a strong signature of isolation by distance among archipelagos (Fig. 2, r2 = 0.541; P &lt;\n\n0.001), but genetic differentiation within the Azores did not seem to relate to geographic distance (Fig. \n\n2, r2 = 0.069; P > 0.12). STRUCTURE analyses performed under mixed ancestry and sampling \n\nlocations as prior information, and the ?K metric of Evanno et al. (2005) revealed that K = 2 was the \n\nmost likely number of gene pools/ clusters for P. aspera in Macaronesia (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3, \n\nrespectively). Two distinct clusters were identified: one involving all Azorean populations and another \n\ngrouping Madeira and Canaries. Population structure became less evident when analytical parameters \n\nand settings were changed in STRUCTURE, especially when prior information for population origin \n\nwas not implemented (see Fig. S4). The spatial model in GENELAND, bearing a correction for null \n\nalleles, estimated the number of clusters for P. aspera in Macaronesia as two, in agreement with initial \n\nSTRUCTURE results (Fig. 3): a northern group encompassing all Azorean populations and a southern \n\ngroup including Madeira and Canaries populations. A significant genetic differentiation among clusters \n\nwas also detected through AMOVA analyses; most of the total variance was due to variation within \n\npopulations (Table S3). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Regression between genetic distances FST/(1 ? FST) and geographical distances (GD) among and within archipelagos \n\n(y1 and y2, respectively).  \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 90 \n\n \nFigure 3.

Mean observed and expected heterozygosity in the first cluster (all samples from \n\nAzores) were 0.315 \u00b1 0.160 SD and 0.701 \u00b1 0.150 SD, respectively. For the second cluster (Madeira \n\nand Canaries samples), the observed mean heterozygosity was 0.285 \u00b1 0.173 SD and the expected \n\nmean heterozygosity was 0.697 \u00b1 0.188 SD. \n\n \n\nTable 2. Genetic variation observed at eleven microsatellite loci within two clusters of P. aspera identified by STRUCTURE and \n\nGENELAND analyses.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Inbreeding \n\nThe multilocus \u201cnull free\u201d average inbreeding coefficient (FIS) as calculated with INEST varied between \n\n0.113 and 0.497 (Table S1). Model comparison using INEST suggests that the heterozygote deficit \n\nobserved in the dataset is better accounted for by inbreeding than by null alleles. In all cases, the nfb \n\nmodel had the lowest DIC (Table S4). Similarly, model comparison with INEST on the two clusters \n\nidentified through Bayesian analyses also indicated that heterozygosities deficits are more related to \n\ninbreeding rather then to null alleles presence: the \u201cnull free\u201d inbreeding coefficient FIS-INEST for each \n\ncluster was 0.399 (95% confidence interval: 0.368 - 0.431) and 0.104 (95% confidence interval: 0.043 \n\n- 0.272), respectively (Table 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 92 \n\n3.4. Bottleneck detection and gene flow \n\nThe heterozygosity excess test implemented in BOTTLENECK did not find evidence for a recent \n\ndemographic bottleneck in any of the clusters assumed (Table S5; P > 0.05). Bottleneck detection \n\nusing the M-ratio method did, however, show that clusters have experienced demographic changes in \n\ntime. Although the performance of the method is dependent on initial assumptions and settings, the \n\nmore conservative approach recommended by Garza and Williamson (2001) indicated a recent \n\nreduction in population size, within the last few hundred generations, for both Azores and Madeira plus \n\nCanaries clusters (Fig. S5). In such case M-ratios for individual clusters fell under the lower 5% of the \n\ndistribution of simulated M-values. Setting the average size of non one-step mutations to 2.8, which is \n\nthe mean value for this parameter in the literature (see Garza and Williamson 2001), increased the \n\ndetection of bottlenecks at higher values of the pre-bottleneck ? (Fig. S5). Estimates of contemporary \n\nmigration rates calculated with BAYESASS showed no signs of gene flow between clusters (Table \n\nS6). Results of bottleneck and migration analyses did not differ when using a reduced loci dataset, i.e. \n\nonly loci with &lt;20% proportion of null alleles. \n\n \n\n4. Discussion \n\nEven though a high dispersal potential is expected in P. aspera as drawn from the pelagic larval \n\nduration of its congeneric European continental form P. ulyssiponensis, which is estimated to range \n\nbetween 14.5 - 27 days (average age of planktonic life in vitro after metamorphic competence; see \n\nRibeiro 2008), unfavourable oceanographic conditions, large larvae mortality and the relatively large \n\ngeographical distance among populations may have prompted the isolation between Azores and those \n\non the remainder of the Macaronesia archipelagos. In fact, larval transport may be strongly affected by \n\nlocal eddies, current reversals and other unknown oceanographic physical patterns (Sponaugle et al. \n\n2002; Palumbi 2004). Moreover, marine larvae often face a huge mortality over relatively short \n\ndistances from their spawning locations (e.g. Cowen et al. 2000). Larvae biological traits (e.g. growth, \n\nswimming and orientation capacities, reproductive and recruitment strategies) and species interactions \n\n(e.g. predation, food availability) may also determine a limited connectivity within a given species \n\n(Cowen and Sponaugle 2009). In fact, genetic breaks in marine invertebrates with high putative \n\ndispersal capacity are not uncommon in the literature (see Galarza et al. 2009; Serrano et al. 2014; \n\nOuagajjou and Presa 2015; Gui\u00f1ez et al. 2016). The relatively fragile nature of patellid larvae (when \n\ncompared, for instance, with crustacean larvae), the realized larval pelagic duration which is \n\npresumably shorter in the field (e.g. Olson and McPherson 1987) and the predominately oligotrophic \n\ncharacter of NE Atlantic waters surrounding the Macaronesia archipelagos (Mara\u00f1on et al. 2000; Silva \n\net al. 2013), may act to favour local retention and limit the dispersal capacity of P. aspera over large \n\ndistances. Thus, genetic differentiation in P. aspera probably arose from the historical and \n\ncontemporary complex interplay of particular biological and physical processes that favoured isolation \n\nover population homogeneity. Nevertheless, the shortest distance between Madeira and Canaries and \n\nthe presence of the Selvagens islands in between both archipelagos, are likely to facilitate larvae \n\ndispersal and population connectivity of P. aspera among those archipelagos. \n\n\n\n\t 93 \n\nHigh inbreeding coefficients were detected in all populations. Such large deviations from HWE and \n\nexcess of homozygotes are often strongly linked to the occurrence of null alleles across loci, with most \n\npopulation genetic studies avoiding their use in analyses. However, deviations from HWE can also be \n\nbiological meaningful, especially when such deviations occur at multiple loci, and may be explained by \n\nseveral nonexclusive factors such as inbreeding, selection against heterozygotes and the Wahlund \n\neffect (Dakin and Avise 2004; Allendorf and Luikart 2007). The individual inbreeding model \n\nimplemented in INEST showed that, although null alleles have an undoubted role on heterozygote \n\ndeficit and interpopulation differentiation, inbreeding appears as the most likely process underpinning \n\nthe observed positive FIS values. Processes that lead to inbreeding in natural populations (e.g. non-\n\nrandom mating) are often considered to be more effective and associated with small populations and \n\nwould hardly affect marine populations with expected high census population sizes. However, \n\nstochastic factors acting upon the recruitment success and especially the anthropogenic influence on \n\nthe population dynamics and demography can lead to an unbalanced genetic composition in \n\nwidespread marine populations (see O\u2019Leary et al. 2013; Aglieri et al. 2014). Such processes can \n\nresult in unexpected levels of relatedness among individuals and therefore inbreeding rates higher \n\nthan expected. Exploitation of P. aspera across Macaronesia not only has reduced its abundance, but \n\nalso the mean size of individuals (see section below). Since P. aspera is a protandric hermaphrodite, \n\ntherefore undergoing sex change from male into female as they grow, harvesting is strongly biased \n\ntowards females. Such reduction in the number of females is believed to trigger non-random mating \n\nand the production of individuals which relatedness is higher than expected by chance. In such over-\n\nharvested populations, the census size (N) can thus greatly differ from the effective population size \n\n(Ne), where the number of individuals that actively contributes for the next generation being rather \n\nsmall. In fact, a reduction in Ne would counter the mechanisms that promote random mating in P. \n\naspera, such as high fecundity, external fertilization with broadcast spawning, and putative extensive \n\nlarval dispersal. Moreover, the fact that harvesting is size selective towards the larger individuals may \n\nimpose a strong selection among heritable characteristics within exploited populations (see Conover \n\nand Munch 2002). Noteworthy, recent research has revealed that the sex-ratio of P. aspera remained \n\nunchanged regardless the increasing fishing pressure, suggesting that males are compensating for \n\nthe removal of larger females by undergoing sex change at smaller and presumably earlier sizes \n\n(Martins et al. 2017), a pattern that has also been observed in other patellid limpets (Borges et al. \n\n2016). Although this mechanism can buffer populations against changes in sex-ratio of the species, \n\nthe fact that females became smaller than their historical size, would affect the amount of gametes \n\nreleased into the water, with obvious negative consequences for the reproductive output of P. aspera. \n\nMoreover, it is still undetermined how this compensatory mechanism is to affect the gametic fitness of \n\nsuch small-size females or its impact on larval viability and dispersal capacity. Under these \n\ncircumstances, inbreeding can emerge from a large variation in individual reproductive success \n\ninfluenced by particular environmental, reproductive and behaviour factors, with only a few individual \n\nlimpets reproducing and actively contributing to the genetic pool of the next generation (see \n\nHedgecock 1994). Although inbreeding is suggested as the main driver for the observed excess of \n\nhomozygotes in P. aspera populations, other alternative mechanisms such as extensive within-\n\n\n\n\t 94 \n\npopulation genetic structure (i.e. the Wahlund effect), higher rates of molecular evolution and \n\nrandomly induced differences in allele frequencies between sperm and eggs have also been proposed \n\nto explain deviations from HWE in free-spawning marine invertebrates (see Addison and Hart 2005). \n\nIn fact, the occurrence of a Wahlund effect cannot be entirely discarded, as unrecognized temporal \n\nbreeding subunits may occur inside sampled populations, resulting in large variations from HWE. \n\nMoreover, seasonal or inter-annual changes in currents might bring together larvae from locally \n\ndifferentiated sources, providing the baseline for genetic patchiness and spatial substructuring of \n\nwithin-population demes. Yet, a Wahlund effect is less likely in our study, since each local geographic \n\nsample was tested separately and Bayesian clustering analyses did not detect any within-sample \n\nstructuring, or within archipelago for that matter (i.e. Azores). Preliminary analyses for within-island \n\ngenetic variation (two sampled locations within each island) also showed the absence of any \n\npopulation structuring at such smaller spatial scale. Furthermore, the impact of the Wahlund effect is \n\nusually more substantial when cryptic populations, recipient and donor, exhibit large differences in \n\ngene diversity (Zhivotovsky 2015); in this case, independently of distance, all P. aspera populations \n\nare relatively genetic impoverished with similar diversity, have individuals with alike morphological \n\ntraits and there are no apparent differentiated niches where putative cohorts could genetically thrive \n\ndistinctively. For instance, C\u00f4rte-Real et al. (1992) found no genetic differences between intertidal and \n\nsubtidal specimens of P. aspera in the Azores. More importantly, although homozygote excess was \n\nshown to be surprisingly common in free-spawning species (see Addison and Hart 2005), deviations \n\nto HWE should be, above all, interpreted under the life-cycle particularities and circumstances of a \n\ngiven species. As so, given the acceptable sample size and number of microsatellite markers used in \n\nthis study, the genome-wide effect detected (i.e. significant heterozygote deficits across all loci \n\nscreened in all populations studied), the specificities of P. aspera reproductive/ breeding cycle and the \n\nunbalanced nature of harvesting, inbreeding seems the most plausible mechanism for the observed \n\nexcess of homozygotes in P. aspera populations from Macaronesia. The retention of planktonic larvae \n\nnear parent habitats, which is not uncommon even in species with very high dispersal potential (e.g. \n\nSwearer et al. 1999), may further support the idea that there are no high levels of immigration from \n\nother sites that otherwise would reduce the chances of inbreeding. A deeper insight into the spatial \n\ngenetic structure of P. aspera populations would be possible by taking the so-called \u2018seascape \n\ngenetics\u2019 approach, and use oceanographic modelling (e.g. Galindo et al. 2006) as well as many other \n\ninteracting forces and traits to understand the processes involved in marine connectivity of the species \n\n(see review by Selkoe et al. 2016) \n\nStudies that include the effect of overexploitation or a reduction in the effective population size on the \n\ngenetic diversity and inbreeding phenomena of marine invertebrates are fairly scarce (e.g. Gallardo et \n\nal. 1998; Constantini et al. 2007), and examples are often provided for other organisms such as fishes \n\n(e.g. Hutchinson et al. 2003; Hoarau et al. 2005; O\u2019Leary et al. 2013). The generalized idea is that \n\ninbreeding, although occurring naturally in many populations, is intensified by overexploitation \n\nreducing the capability for adaptation and increasing the extinction risk (Keller and Waller 2002; \n\nFrankham 2005). Under these circumstances, exploited populations will tend to suffer to a greater \n\nextent from demographic and genetic stochasticity and face higher chances of extinction due to \n\n\n\n\t 95 \n\ninbreeding or loss of genetic diversity by drift (Frankham et al. 2014). Population subdivision can also \n\nfoster inbreeding by decreasing migrants among subpopulations and prompting chances for mating \n\namong relatives (Bierne et al. 1998; Andrade and Solferini 2007). In such case, and even assuming \n\nrandom mating, inbreeding could occur because population sizes are very limited and the \n\nconsequences of genetic drift become apparent (Keller and Waller 2002). In fact, population \n\ndifferentiation in P. aspera given by pairwise distances estimates (FST and Dest) indicated some degree \n\nof subdivision among islands (see Table 2). These estimates, however, may be unreliable, and \n\ninterpretation should be cautious due to the known impact of null alleles in overestimating population \n\ndifferentiation. With much greater support, our findings suggested that i) Azores samples comprise an \n\nisolated population and ii) Madeira and Canaries populations cluster together in a single group. \n\nMoreover, insular populations of P. aspera are thought to have been isolated from continental forms \n\nfor the last 4 - 8 Ma (S\u00e1-Pinto et al. 2005; 2008). These same studies, using mtDNA analyses, \n\nrevealed genetic differentiation between Azores and the remaining archipelagos. Given the high level \n\nof isolation and the similarity in environmental conditions among archipelagos, genetic diversity is not \n\nexpected to be high. Whereas genetic diversity, under these circumstances, can be lost purely due to \n\ngenetic drift, the prolonged and long-time harvesting of limpets across archipelagos is likely to have \n\nnegatively impacted genetic diversity and favoured inbreeding due to a reduction in the effective \n\npopulation size in P. aspera.  Unfortunately, there are no current estimates of P. aspera effective \n\npopulation sizes throughout the region. Yet, considering the historical and more recent Catch Per Unit \n\nEffort (CPUE) as a reliable proxy of population census sizes in P. aspera, i.e. in the early 1990\u2019s there \n\nwere still places in Azores where CPUE was around 12 kg / half hour but this has fallen to 5 g / half \n\nhour in recent years (OSPAR-Commission (2010), it is clear that a dramatic reduction in the \n\nabundance of animals has taken place, which is likely to have negatively affected the present-day Ne \n\nin P. aspera across the region. \n\n \n\n4.1. Implications for the management and conservation \n\nHarvesting of P. aspera, which is currently listed in the OSPAR list of threatened and/or declining \n\nspecies and habitats (OSPAR-Commission 2010), is under specific legislation throughout the \n\nMacaronesia region. At each archipelago, seasonal fishing closures and minimum catch sizes have \n\nbeen imposed: Azores (October - April, 50 mm); Madeira (December-March, 40 mm); and Canaries \n\n(December - April, 45 mm). Moreover, harvesting is forbidden inside specific marine protected areas \n\nand/or limpet protection zones in each archipelago. Catch limits (kg) per day for commercial (with \n\npermit only) and recreational use have also been established. Seasonal closures have broadly been \n\ndefined in agreement with reproductive periods occurring during colder months (see Vale 2016). \n\nDespite this, non-compliance with current legislation is the norm among limpet harvesters (see Diogo \n\net al. 2016). Empirical evidence suggests that P. aspera stocks are pretty much depleted and \n\noverexploited (Martins et al. 2008; 2011) and the lack of enforcement of regulations is seen as the \n\nmost likely reason for the failure to protect limpet populations. To raise awareness, regional authorities \n\nshould promote environmental education actions directed to fishermen and general public, for the \n\n\n\n\t 96 \n\nimportance of the sustainable use of limpets as a resource as well as a key ecological asset. Limpet \n\nprotection zones, which have been shown to be largely ineffective (see Martins et al. 2011; Diogo et \n\nal. 2016), would likely work if permanently monitored and surveyed by local authorities. Management \n\napproaches should also target intermediate-sized individuals by establishing an upper size limit on \n\nlimpets (Conover and Munch 2002; Allendorf et al. 2008). In the short term, this would increase the \n\nnumber of larger females potentially generating higher-quality offspring and contributing to an \n\nincreasing effective population size in P. aspera (see Birkeland and Dayton 2005) and thus helping \n\nreducing inbreeding rates. From a stock perspective, and considering the population differentiation \n\nfound among the Azorean and other archipelagos\u2019 populations, both Madeira and Canaries authorities \n\nshould join efforts in establishing a common management strategy for the protection and harvesting of \n\nP. aspera in those archipelagos. Moreover, the high levels of isolation and exploitation of the Azorean \n\npopulations suggests that authorities must act immediately to avoid the genetic and demographic \n\ndepletion of P. aspera stocks in the Azores. Scientifically sound data on this limpet reproductive cycle, \n\nits recruitment rate and its demographic status would help inform conservation actions and formal \n\nstock definition. Although genetic approaches are only a small piece in the intricate puzzle of defining \n\neffective fishery stocks, this study suggests that limpet conservation and fisheries management across \n\nMacaronesia should, at the very least, consider two independent stocks: one in Azores and another \n\none in Madeira - Canaries. Management and conservation initiatives need to be revisited in the light of \n\nsuch results. Above all, the most direct way to reduce the effects of over-exploitation on P. aspera \n\nacross the Macaronesian region is to drastically reduce the intensity of harvest of its populations. \n\n \n\nFunding \n\nThis research was partially supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through \n\nthe COMPETE ?

Sampling and laboratory procedures  \n\nBriefly, 17 microsatellite markers were amplified in three multiplex PCR reactions containing 5 \u2013 6 loci \n\nusing the Qiagen\u00ae PCR multiplexing kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. \n\nAmplifications took place on a MyCyclerTM thermal cycler (BioRad) using a touchdown protocol and a \n\nfinal volume of 10 ?L with approximately 10 ng DNA template, 1 \u00d7 QiagenTM Multiplex PCR Kit, 0.4 - \n\n1.2 ?M of each primer and ddH2O. The PCR routine for each multiplex reaction consisted of an initial \n\ndenaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 5 cycles of touchdown amplification (denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 \n\nsec, annealing temperature (TA) (see Faria et al. 2015) for 1 min descending by 0.5\u00b0C intervals to the \n\noptimal TA, plus extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 sec; 22 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, optimal TA for 1 min, and \n\nextension at 72\u00b0C for 40 sec; 10 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 53\u00b0C for 50 sec, 72\u00b0C for 45 sec; and a \n\nfinal extension step at 60\u00b0C for 30 min. Approximately 20% of the samples were re-run to ensure \n\nrepeatability in scoring. Amplified fragments were visualized using an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems) \n\nautomated DNA sequencer with GeneScanTM 500Liz (Applied Biosystems) as an internal size \n\nstandard for accurate sizing.

In order to avoid potential bias when assigning FST as outlier due to \n\nrandom drift and historical events affecting gene flow, the two more geographically distant populations \n\n(Madeira and Gran Canaria) were removed from analysis.  \n\n \n\n2.3. Population structure  \n\nPOWSIM v.4.0 (Ryman and Palm 2006):? Simulations were carried out considering combinations of \n\nseveral effective population sizes (Ne) and number of generations (t). Observed allele frequencies \n\nwere used as a starting point. In all cases, 1 000 replicates were run and the power of the analysis \n\nwas indicated by the proportion of tests that were significant at P &lt;0.05 based on chi-square and \n\nFisher\u2019s exact tests.  \n\nSTRUCTURE v.2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. 2000): STRUCTURE, which allows determining the most \n\nplausible K number of genetically homogeneous groups in the dataset. The analyses were run with \n\n105 burn-in iterations followed by 5 \u00d7 105 Markov chain Monte Carlo steps, applying an admixture \n\nancestry model with correlated allele frequencies and prior sampling location information (LOCPRIOR \n\n\n\n\t 105 \n\n= 1). Considering the origin of individuals as prior information is more powerful in detecting weak \n\ngenetic structure, reduces mis-assignments and increases the sensibility of STRUCTURE in clustering \n\npopulations with low genetic divergence (Hubisz et al. 2009).  \n\nGENELAND (Guillot et al. 2005):? GENELAND which can account for the presence of null alleles \n\nwhile incorporating geographical coordinates information for genotyped individuals to estimate the \n\nmost likely number of clusters and their spatial boundaries. Given the prior knowledge regarding \n\ndispersal and potential barriers to gene flow in P. aspera, preference was given to the spatial model \n\nwith null alleles. Even so, distinct model conditions were also tested. To improve the detection of \n\nsubtle genetic structure (Guillot 2008), all models assumed correlated allele frequencies. For each \n\nmodel, three independent MCMC runs were conducted, each consisting of 2 \u00d7 107 iterations with a \n\nthinning of 1 000 after a burn-in of 2 \u00d7 103. Consistency between runs was assessed by checking that \n\nthey provided approximately the same parameter estimates (K, individual population membership, \n\nmaps). The highest average posterior probability was used as a criterion to select the best run under \n\nthe given set of model conditions.  \n\n \n\n2.5. Bottleneck detection and gene flow  \n\nBOTTLENECK v.1.2.02 (Cornuet and Luikart, 1996):? Because microsatellites rarely conform strictly \n\nto the infinite allele mutation (IAM) model or the stepwise-mutation model (SMM), the two-phase \n\nmodel (TPM) accommodating both mutation types was adopted (Di Rienzo et al. 1994; Piry et al. \n\n1999). TPM was parameterized with 78% and 90% single-step mutations, assuming a conservative \n\nvariance among multiple steps of 12 as recommended for microsatellites (Piry et al. 1999, Peery et al. \n\n2012). The significance of the heterozygosity excess was assessed using the one-tail Wilcoxon sign-\n\nrank test with 10 000 iterations. Each analysis was independently carried out for each inferred genetic \n\ncluster provided by STRUCTURE and GENELAND (see Results).  \n\nM_p_val (Garza and Williamson 2001):? This analysis is considered to be more appropriate to detect \n\ngenetic bottlenecks that occurred over relatively long periods of time (> 100 generations). The M-ratio \n\ntest is based on the ratio of the number of alleles over the range in allele size and it can identify gaps \n\nin the allele size frequency distribution resulting from loss of alleles due to bottleneck events. Loci with \n\nodd-sized alleles (those that did not represent multiples of the recognized repeat unit) were omitted \n\nfrom analyses. Three parameters are required by the method: the pre-bottleneck value of ? = 4Nemu \n\n(where Ne is the effective pre-bottleneck population size at equilibrium and mu is the mutation rate), \n\nthe fraction of mutations that are larger than single steps (ps) and the average size of non-single-step \n\nmutations (?g). Because such information is not available for P. aspera in particular, a broad range of \n\ninput parameters were tested, including Garza and Williamson (2001) findings and recommendations \n\n(see Results). A range of values of ? from 0.1 to 200 (corresponding to Ne values of 50 - 100 000) \n\nwere tested to determine the sensitivity of M to changes in such parameter and assuming an average \n\nmutation rate of 5 \u00d7 10-4. The observed M-ratio for each cluster was then compared to the critical \n\nvalue obtained in CRITICAL_M and estimated through 10 000 simulations with the same parameters \n\nas the data and assuming the population to be at drift\u2013migration equilibrium. Lower M-ratios than \n\n\n\n\t 106 \n\npopulations at equilibrium is taken as evidence that the sample is from a population that had \n\nexperienced a recent bottleneck (Garza and Williamson 2001).  \n\nBAYESASS v.3.0 (Wilson and Rannala 2003):? Ten MCMC runs with different initial seeds using 106 \n\nburn-in, following by 3 \u00d7 106 sampling iterations were carried out in order to maximize convergence \n\nand mixing. Mixing parameters were adjusted to achieve acceptance rates of 20 - 40%. The Bayesian \n\ndeviance was used as an optimality criterion to find the run with the best fit (Faubet et al. 2007). \n\nDeviance was calculated from the trace file using the R-script provided by Meirmans (2014).  \n\n \n\nReferences  \n\nAntao T, Lopes A, Lopes RJ, Beja-Pereira A, Luikart G (2008) LOSITAN: A workbench to detect \n\nmolecular adaptation based on a FST-outlier method.

When considering marine \n\nexploited species population persistence is a fine balance between individuals that are removed by \n\nharvesting and individuals that are added to the population via recruitment. A spatially and temporally \n\nreplicated monitoring programme was put in place during 2014-2015 to assess the levels of \n\nrecruitment of the exploited limpet Patella candei (d'Orbigny 1839) in the Azores (NE Atlantic). \n\nRecruitment occurred throughout both years but its intensity varied in space and time. The mean \n\nnumber of recruits per m2 in 2014 and 2015 was 26.3 (\u00b11.7 SE) and 11.3 (\u00b10.9 SE), respectively. In \n\ngeneral, a marked peak in recruitment occurred during winter/spring months, the period of greatest \n\nreproductive activity, when sea surface temperatures were lower and wave turbulence higher. There \n\nwas a significant correlation between sea surface temperature (SST), significant wave height (HS), \n\nwave period (TZ) and wave direction (WDIR) and limpet recruitment. While each of these environmental \n\nvariables may have individually influenced reproduction and recruitment, significant wave height (HS) \n\nwas probably the most important proximate factor triggering the recruitment of P. candei. This single \n\nvariable accounted for the observed inter-annual variation in recruitment levels. The understanding of \n\nhow such environmental processes are coupled with larval recruitment dynamics is a key aspect in \n\nfisheries science, and may help to improve conservation strategies aimed at achieving a sustainable \n\nuse of exploited marine resources. \n\n  \n\nKEYWORDS: settlement, environmental variables, wave action, dispersal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nManuscript in preparation as: \n\nFaria J, Ribeiro PA, Miller P, Azevedo ED, Hawkins SJ, Neto AI, Martins GM. In prep. Spatial and \n\ntemporal patterns in recruitment in the exploited limpet Patella candei. \n\n\n\n\t 118 \n\n1. Introduction \n\nRecruitment, which is broadly regarded as the addition of new individuals to populations, is considered \n\na critical step for marine organisms to thrive (Caley et al. 1996; Palumbi and Pinsky 2014). Many of \n\nthese organisms are sessile or sedentary as adults; therefore their persistence is largely or exclusively \n\ndependent on the addition of new juveniles to the population. If this compensatory mechanism is \n\nsomehow reduced, then populations will be particularly vulnerable to over-harvesting or other \n\nperturbations (Fogarty et al. 1991). Conversely, impacts on marine adult populations (e.g. over-\n\nexploitation) can negatively impact their reproductive output, fertilization success and hence \n\nsubsequent recruitment (e.g. Kelly et al. 2009). Local production of offspring may, however, have little \n\nto no direct effect in determining population size, providing that connectivity allows replenishing of \n\npopulations by the addition of individuals produced elsewhere (Underwood and Fairweather 1989; \n\nCaley et al. 1996). \n\nIn most marine benthic invertebrate species, reproduction occurs through the release of eggs or \n\ngamete into the water and by developing a planktonic larval stage that can potentially disperse tens to \n\nhundreds of kilometers in the water column before settling into suitable habitats. The development, \n\nsurvival and settlement of these early-life stages are dependent on the combined forces of several \n\nphysical and biological factors, such as temperature (e.g. Han 2011; Rankin and Sponaugle 2011), \n\nwave action (e.g. Jenkins et al. 1997), light conditions (Tatsumi and Wright 2016), food availability \n\n(e.g. Castonguay et al. 2008), competition (e.g. Hixon and Jones 2005) and predation (e.g. Doherty et \n\nal. 2004). Moreover, many larvae exhibit selective settlement (e.g. Knight-Jones 1953; Crisp 1974; \n\nJenkins 2005), mediated by physiological and behavioural responses to physical or chemical cues \n\nbroadly associated with adult presence at suitable sites (e.g. Crisp 1967; Crisp and Meadows 1962; \n\nMiron et al. 1996; Kay 2002; Cahill and Koury 2016), or by habitat complexity (e.g. Underwood 2004; \n\nBohn et al. 2013) or biofilms (Thompson et al. 1998). The challenges associated with the addition of \n\nnew individuals via pelagic larvae to sessile and often patchy adult populations are immense and \n\ncritical for the persistence and dynamics of marine benthic species. Larval stages are thus the most \n\nsensitive stage in the life cycle of many marine benthic organisms. Furthermore, post-settlement \n\nprocesses involving complex interactions between predators (Keough and Downes 1982; Doherty et \n\nal. 2004), competitors (e.g. Denley and Underwood 1979; Underwood et al. 1983), shelter (Butler and \n\nHerrnkind 1997) and food availability, and physical disturbances (Lewis and Bowman 1975) can have \n\na major influence on recruitment success (see review by Hunt and Scheibling 1997). Understanding \n\nthe scale at which physical and biological processes are coupled with larval recruitment has a crucial \n\nimportance in identifying temporal abundance patterns of adult populations, their distribution and \n\nresilience to disturbances. This information can then be used in implementing marine ecosystem \n\nmanagement and conservation approaches to marine stocks facing continuous exploitation. \n\nThe limpet Patella candei (d'Orbigny 1840) is a marine gastropod mollusc that commonly occurs at \n\nmid to high intertidal levels on rocky shores across the Macaronesia archipelagos (NE Atlantic) with \n\nthe exception of Cape Verde. As a broadcast spawner, P. candei releases gametes into the water \n\ncolumn, and upon fertilization, they go thorough a planktonic larval stage wherein a trochophore larvae \n\n\n\n\t 119 \n\ndevelops to a pre and post-torsional veliger, before settling on hard substrate and metamorphosing. \n\nAs in other patellids, the pelagic larval duration is assumed to last between a few days and few weeks, \n\ndepending on water temperature (Hawkins et al. 2000; Ribeiro et al. 2009). The success of fertilization \n\nis dependent of a number of variables (e.g. sperm concentration, gamete age and contact time) but \n\nthese are not likely to significantly affect dispersal, which is mostly a function of the duration of the \n\nplanktonic larvae in the water column (Hodgson et al. 2007). According to Martins et al. (1987), P. \n\ncandei shows no marked peak of spawning and resting period throughout the year. Yet, more recent \n\nstudies have confirmed that P. candei is in fact primarily a winter breeder (see Henriques et al. 2012; \n\nVale 2016), with a greater proportion of individuals reaching the spawning stage (see gonad ripening \n\nstages in Orton et al. 1956) between late-autumn and spring months, with a resting season in the \n\nsummer. In Patella vulgata (Linnaeus 1758), winter breeding is generally assumed to be associated \n\nwith a decrease in temperature (Bowman and Lewis 1977) and/or to more turbulent water conditions \n\n(Blackmore 1969). Whereas temperature can play a vital role in reproductive phenology and early \n\nlarval growth-related traits, wave action is considered to trigger spawning and facilitate the release and \n\ntransport of gametes in Patella (mainly studies on P. vulgata: Orton et al. 1956; Bowman and Lewis \n\n1977, 1986; Thompson 1979; Moore et al. 2011).  \n\nThe fate of P. candei larvae in their natural environment is largely unknown. Despite living in a pelagic \n\nenvironment structured by physical processes, which may limit the species capacity to disperse, \n\npatellid larvae are offered a vast range of opportunities that may help them find a suitable settlement \n\nsite. Recent evidence from in-vitro fertilization trials showed that P. candei larvae are planktotrophic \n\nand can feed on diatoms (see Chapter 7). Planktotrophic larvae have the potential to disperse longer \n\ndistances (Scheltema 1986). Moreover, patellid trochophore and veliger larvae are active swimmers, \n\nshowing bursts of fast upward/horizontal swimming and passive sinking (Ribeiro 2008), which may \n\nallow them to position in the water column in areas where food is available and/or currents are \n\nfavourable. Such conspicuous behaviour exposes larvae to different flow regimes, which is likely to \n\naffect and determine their growth, mortality and dispersal (e.g. Fiksen et al. 2007). Patellid larvae also \n\nshow chemotaxic behaviour upon substratum selection (Ribeiro 2008). This allows individuals to find \n\nthe most suitable habitat, providing higher chances of survival and post-settlement performance (Elkin \n\nand Marshall 2007). For instance, the presence of crustose coralline algae is known to induce \n\nsubstratum-specific settlement, attachment and metamorphosis in several marine gastropods \n\nincluding abalones (Morse et al. 1984; Barlow 1990; Roberts and Nicholson 1997) and limpets \n\n(McGrath and Foley 2005; Ribeiro 2008). The exact cues for such site selection are still poorly \n\nunderstood. \n\nPatellid larvae may also be challenged in finding suitable space to settle on rocky shores. Long-term \n\nexploitation of limpets in the Azores (Martins et al. 2008a) has resulted in most of the space at mid-\n\nshore levels being dominated by algal turfs, which preclude the settlement of limpets (Martins et al. \n\n2010). This has also been shown elsewhere (see Underwood et al. 1983; Boaventura et al. 2002). \n\nVery little information is available on recruitment of P. candei, and most of it comes from anecdotal \n\nevidence derived from field observations or extrapolations made from adult gonad maturation periods \n\n\n\n\t 120 \n\n(Vale 2016) and length\u2013frequency observations (Henriques et al. 2012). This study is aimed at \n\nquantifying the temporal and spatial variation in recruitment of P. candei on the south coast of S\u00e3o \n\nMiguel Island, Azores, and establish possible relationships between real-time environmental data such \n\nas sea surface temperatures and wave action, and limpet recruitment. This information is not only \n\ncrucial for understanding the population dynamics of exploited stocks of P. candei, but also to assess \n\nthe role of physical/environmental processes in recruitment variability.  \n\n \n\n2. Methods \n\n2.1. Study sites and communities \n\nThis study was conducted on two consecutive years (2014 - 2015) across stretches of 20 m in four \n\nlocations of the S\u00e3o Miguel Island, Azores (Fig. 1). All locations are of volcanic origin (basalt sensu \n\nlato) and moderately exposed to southerly wave action, and consist of small rocky platforms that \n\nsupport similar assemblages of animals and plants. The lower shore is mostly dominated by coarsely \n\nbranched algae (e.g. articulated coralline algae, Gelidium spp. and Caulacanthus ustulatus), whilst the \n\nbarnacle Chthamalus stellatus dominates on the upper shore. Ephemeral algae such as Ulva spp. and \n\nChaetomorpha spp. can be seasonally abundant and scattered clumps of the brown algae Fucus \n\nspiralis are also observed at mid-shore levels. Common fauna include the periwinkles Tectarius \n\nstriatus and Melarhaphe neritoides, and the patellid species P. candei, which are the most abundant \n\nlittoral grazers (Hawkins et al. 1990, Martins et al. 2008b). \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Sampling locations in S\u00e3o Miguel island, Azores. \n\n\n\n\t 121 \n\n2.2. Sampling design \n\nA total of 15 basaltic plates (7 \u00d7 7 cm) mimicking the natural coastal substrate, were initially placed at \n\nthe mid-shore level in the transition between algal turfs and barnacles at each location, where P. \n\ncandei abundance is highest (Martins et al. 2010). These plates were collected monthly during spring \n\nlow tides and replaced by new ones. Quantification of P. candei recruits on plates was done under an \n\noptical microscope. Individuals with 0.5 cm or less (total shell length) were considered as recruits (or \n\nrecently recruited) as in Martins et al. (2010) (Fig. S1). As in other patellids (e.g. Hartnoll and Wright \n\n1977), P. candei also exhibits a homing behaviour (E. Cacabelos, unpublished data 2014), where \n\nindividuals upon recruiting in a small rock depression/ hole/ crevice to which the shell margin \n\nconforms, tend to return to the same area after foraging excursions. Such homing behaviour on top of \n\nour size-based definition of recruits ensures that the number of smaller-sized animals observed on a \n\ngiven plate are likely a surrogate of recent settlement leading to recruitment in that particular month. \n\nEnvironmental data were obtained from a moored buoy located on the south coast of S\u00e3o Miguel \n\nisland, Azores (37\u00ba 43.546' N / 25\u00ba 43.284') which is run under the projects CLIMAAT - MAC 2.3/A.3, \n\nCLIMAAT II - 03/MAC/2.3/A.5 and CLIMARCOST \u2013 05/MAC/2.3/A1. Sea surface temperature (SST), \n\nsignificant wave height (HS), wave period (TZ) and wave direction (WDIR: degrees north from which the \n\nwaves are traveling) were recorded at time intervals of 10 secs during the course of this study. Due to \n\nmissing data (owing to buoy malfunction during part of the experimental period), SST estimates were \n\nalso obtained from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u2019s Multi-Scale High Resolution SST (MUR SST), \n\nwhich merges data from infrared and passive microwave datasets collected from satellites into global \n\ndaily maps gridded at 1 km resolution, generating a product that contains no cloud contamination (see \n\nChin et al. 1998; more information can be found at http://mur.jpl.nasa.gov/). SST data were extracted \n\non a weekly basis around a 2 km buffer of the sampling locations. Monthly time series were \n\nreconstructed for all environmental variables. \n\n \n\n2.3. Data analysis \n\nSpatial and temporal differences in limpet recruitment were examined using a 3-way analysis of \n\nvariance (ANOVA) with the following factors: \u2018year\u2019 (fixed factor, 2 levels), \u2018month\u2019 (random factor and \n\nnested within year, 12 levels) and \u2018location\u2019 (random factor and orthogonal to other factors, 4 levels) \n\nwith 15 replicates. Temporal variation in environmental variables was analysed by means of a 2-way \n\nANOVA following the same general design but without the factor \u2018location\u2019. \n\nGiven that recruitment of P. candei showed a clear peak during early months in each year (see section \n\nbelow), analyses were also run using a subset of months corresponding to this specific period and \n\nthus avoiding the influence of an excessive number of zeros in the analyses. This recruitment period \n\nwas defined as the broadest time interval where monthly recruitment averages were greater than the \n\nyearly average, which corresponded, in this study, to the period between January and April. All tests \n\nwere done using PERMANOVA+ based on Euclidean distances and using 999 permutations \n\n(Anderson et al. 2008). Prior to analyses, data were checked for heterogeneity of variances and \n\n\n\n\t 122 \n\ntransformations were applied when needed (Underwood 1997). Analyses were performed on \n\nuntransformed data when attempts to stabilize variances through transformation were unsuccessful. In \n\nsuch cases, because of the increased likelihood of Type I error, a more conservative significance level \n\n(? = 0.01) was used when testing for differences (Underwood 1997). \n\nThe association between recruitment and each environmental variable was assessed in R v.3.3.0 (R \n\nCore Team 2014) using a correlation/ linear regression analysis. Due to high collinearity among \n\nenvironmental variables (see Quinn and Keough 2002), the distance-based linear models routine \n\n(DistLM, Anderson et al. 2008) was then used to examine how much of the variability in P. candei \n\nrecruitment was accounted for by each of the environmental (predictor) variables measured by the \n\nbuoy. Predictor variables were fitted individually in marginal tests to determine their relationship with \n\nrecruitment and identify their relative contribution for the observed variation in recruitment. All DistLM \n\nanalyses were based on Euclidean dissimilarities, and P-values for testing the null hypothesis of no \n\nrelationship were obtained using 999 permutations.  \n\n \n\n3. Results \n\nAlthough recruitment of P. candei was recorded throughout both years of survey, its intensity varied in \n\nspace and time (Fig. 2; Table S1; Fig. S2). The mean number of recruits per m2 in 2014 and 2015 was \n\n26.3 (\u00b1 1.7 SE) and 11.3 (\u00b1 0.9 SE), respectively. A marked peak in recruitment occurred in \n\nwinter/spring months, especially in 2014 when recruitment was substantially greater (Fig. 3). When \n\nconsidering only the period of highest recruitment (January to April), analyses showed a significant \n\ninteraction between \u2018year\u2019 and \u2018location\u2019 (ANOVA, P &lt;0.05; Table S2). Inspection of a posteriori tests \n\nshowed that recruitment of P. candei was consistently higher in 2014 on all four locations examined \n\n(Fig. 4). During this period, the mean number of recruits per m2 in 2014 and 2015 was 57 (\u00b1 3.9 SE) \n\nand 17.1 (\u00b1 2.0 SE), respectively. \n\nFigure 2.

The DistLM analysis showed that \n\nenvironmental variables, when considered separately, significantly predicted the recruitment of P. \n\ncandei. However, marginal tests (Table 1) showed that HS was the best single predictor accounting for \n\nabout 69% of the variation in recruitment, whilst WDIR, TZ and SSTBUOY explained a reduced proportion \n\nof recruitment (48%, 44% and 40% respectively). Moreover, significant variation between years for the \n\nenvironmental variables was only detected for wave height (ANOVA, P &lt;0.05; Table S3), which was \n\n51.3 % higher in 2014 compared to 2015 (15.1% when considering only the same months in both \n\nyears). \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Discussion \n\nThis study shows that P. candei recruitment, although occurring throughout the year, shows a peak \n\nduring winter/spring months (January to April), following peak reproductive activity when sea surfaces \n\ntemperatures are lowest and wave action is highest. A similar pattern was described for P. candei in \n\nMadeira Island, about 920 km southeast of Azores (see Henriques et al. 2012). While each of the four \n\nenvironmental variables investigated here may have influenced recruitment on its own, significant \n\n\n\n\t 125 \n\nwave height (HS) was probably the most important factor triggering the recruitment of P. candei. In \n\nfact, it was the only variable that effectively accounted for the observed inter-annual variation in \n\nrecruitment: a roughly 40% decrease in limpet recruitment from 2014 to 2015. Wave action has been \n\npositively associated with release (Orton et al. 1956; Orton and Southward 1961; Shanks 1998) the \n\ntransport and settlement of larvae on coastal shores (Jeffery and Underwood 2000) and it is \n\nconsidered a good proxy of nearshore larval transport. This relationship, however, is likely to follow a \n\ndome-shaped function (see Cury and Roy 1989), in which the capacity of larvae to settle and recruit \n\nmay be limited by higher wave weights (Ortega 1981). Yet, as with any conclusions based on \n\ncorrelations, this strong relationship between recruitment variation and wave height can be caused by \n\nother covarying factors such as temperature, wind speeds, wind direction, water flow, tides, coastal \n\nupwellings and/or nutrient inputs. These and many other processes often interact together in \n\ndetermining recruitment variation at multiple spatial and temporal scales (see Pineda et al. 2007, \n\n2009). For instance, the spatial variation detected in P. candei recruitment likely reflects the intricate \n\ninfluence of several spatially structured nearshore processes operating at very localized spatial scales \n\ni.e. without ruling out stochastic events by themselves, features such as local geomorphology (Palma \n\net al. 2006), substrate microtopography (Kohler et al. 1999) and local flow patterns (Archambault and \n\nBourget 1999; Shanks et al. 2003) may interact in a complex way to determine if recruits are to occur \n\nor not in precise rocky shores areas, leading to unpredictable patterns of spatial variability in \n\nrecruitment. Moreover, the spatial variability in recruitment may arise from processes that directly \n\naffect settlement and post-settlement mortality rates, such as the larval response to various abiotic \n\nand biotic cues on the substratum, including surface texture or chemistry, conspecifics, and the \n\npresence or absence of other macrobenthic species or microbial biofilms (see review in Hunt and \n\nScheibling 1997). Interestingly, the trend in recruitment levels of P. candei, although variable between \n\nsites, showed a remarkable consistency between years (see Fig. 4). This highlights the significant \n\nimportance of small spatial-scale processes in determining local coastal communities. \n\nThe life-history strategy of P. candei seems to take advantage of wintertime conditions as a means to \n\nmaximize reproduction, spawning, larval development, dispersal and survival. But the magnitude and \n\ninterplay of conditions that affect the outcome of any one of these phases can be considerably \n\ndifferent. For instance, temperature is known to be an ultimate driver for phenology and reproductive \n\ntraits such as maturing and the development of ripe-stage gonads in limpets, while storms and wave \n\naction are often seen as proximate cues to spawning events (Orton et al. 1956; Bowman and Lewis \n\n1977; Moore et al. 2011). The variable nature of such processes will ultimately play a determinant role \n\nin shaping recruitment variability patterns in space and time. For instance, as homologous \n\ntemperatures did not differ between years, the most likely cause for recruitment failure in 2015 in P. \n\ncandei may be associated to inadequate conditions of processes that usually work as proximate cues \n\nto spawning and/or recruitment, such has storms and wave action. \n\nAs winter brooders, the temperatures recorded during winter/spring months are probably within the \n\nrange for optimal phenology, larval development and early recruit growth in P. candei. Also, within the \n\nNorth Atlantic subtropical province, where Azores is included, wintertime mixing provides the seasonal \n\nreplenishment of nutrients to the euphotic zone while in spring, thermal stratification favours \n\n\n\n\t 126 \n\nphytoplankton growth, which progressively leads to surface nutrient depletion by late summer (Silva et \n\nal. 2013). Assuming that the phytoplankton is the primary food source for P. candei larvae, the most \n\nbeneficial timing for reproduction and recruitment would be prior or overlaid to the period of highest \n\nfood abundance, providing that there is a positive balance between food gains and predatory and \n\ncompetition losses. Moreover, the life-history strategy of P. candei allows the species to avoid the time \n\nof the year when coastal thermal stress is higher and wave action is weaker, preventing mortality of \n\nearly recruits from desiccation or overheating conditions to which the early stages of many marine \n\ninvertebrates are susceptible (e.g. Kordas et al. 2015). \n\nDue to the geographical isolation of the Azores, recruitment is restricted to the local production of \n\noffspring and/or dispersal from more distant populations within the archipelago (Faria et al. 2017). \n\nIdentifying the exact source of recruits remains a great challenge for marine ecologists, especially \n\nbecause of the difficulties in tracking such small size individuals through the dynamic nature of the \n\npelagic environment (Swearer et al. 2002). Nevertheless, a growing number of studies indicate that \n\nself-recruitment is a common process in many benthic marine species (e.g. Jones et al. 1999; \n\nKingsford et al. 2002; Teske et al. 2016), providing selective advantages over long-distance dispersal \n\n(see Strathmann et al. 2002). In fact, for many marine species, larval behaviour and nearshore \n\nhydrodynamic processes may promote the retention of planktonic larvae close to parental habitats. In \n\nsuch cases, the ability of larvae to recruit back to their natal populations may offer them a more \n\neffective opportunity of finding suitable habitats and minimize the risk of predation (Swearer et al. \n\n2002). Despite this, there is no solid indication that self-recruitment is the main process acting upon P. \n\ncandei populations. Whether this might be the case, several aspects of the life history of P. candei \n\nseem to support a more open population model, with larvae dispersing over long distances and \n\nsettling far from their parents\u2019 area, on occasional fast recruitment events during storms. First, feeding \n\nlarvae have the potential to support a relatively long pelagic duration and, despite their swimming \n\ncapacity, P. candei larvae are quite small and likely act as passive particles that can be easily \n\ntransported by currents to more remote locations far from their origin i.e. between close-by islands in \n\nAzores. Secondly, most P. candei gametes are released into the water column during wintertime (Vale \n\n2016), under stronger turbulent waters, which promote mixing, fertilization and initial transport away \n\nfrom parental areas. Moreover, in S\u00e3o Miguel island, local recruitment does not seem to be strictly \n\ncorrelated with local production i.e. November has the highest percentage of ripe individuals (Vale \n\n2016) and recruitment tends to peak between January and April. As mentioned above, this temporal \n\nmismatch can probably be a consequence of specific environmental requirements needed to trigger \n\nreproduction and recruitment, and does not necessarily mean that recruits are originating from \n\nelsewhere; ripe gonads do occur throughout the winter/spring season and given the appropriate cues \n\nfor spawning (Vale 2016), recruitment can still be generated locally. \n\nAnother aspect to note is derived from stock-recruitment relationships. For instance, Martins et al. \n\n(2008a) showed that the number of islanders per coastal perimeter is a good predictor of the \n\nabundance of P. candei across the Azorean archipelago, and that the number of larger animals \n\ndecrease with increasing island population. Being the most populated island, S\u00e3o Miguel has \n\npresumably the lowest number of larger individuals of P. candei per coastal perimeter, considerably \n\n\n\n\t 127 \n\nlimiting the reproductive capacity and offspring production of the species on the island. Therefore, a \n\nlikely source of P. candei recruits in S\u00e3o Miguel could be from close-by populations from different \n\nislands of the archipelago (i.e. Santa Maria, Formigas). As long as recruitment continues, these highly \n\nexploited populations will persist even if local production is limited. Although the implications of genetic \n\nconnectivity and demographic connectivity can be substantially different (see Lowe and Allendorf \n\n2010), the homogeneous gene pool detected throughout the archipelago (Faria et al. 2017) may \n\nfurther support this open population model, where connectivity between limpet populations in different \n\nislands is maintained via exchange of pelagic larvae.  \n\nAlthough many physical and biological processes are known to play a pivotal role in the development \n\nand survival of larval stages, settlers and early recruits in marine invertebrates, the direct effect of \n\neach process is hardly identifiable. Despite the challenges, understanding how these processes are \n\ncoupled with larval recruitment has crucial importance to implement marine ecosystem management \n\nand conservation initiatives. Moreover, the prediction of recruitment fluctuations, especially \n\nconsidering the environmental changes that are expected under a rapid climate change scenario (i.e. \n\nwarmer oceans, extreme weather events; IPCC 2014) is a fundamental aspect to consider in \n\nassessing metapopulation dynamics and resilience in exploited marine organisms. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nWe thank Afonso Prestes, Cristina Bernabeu, Eva Cacabelos, Ignatio Moreu, Isadora Moniz, Maria del \n\nMar, Maria Vale, Marina Prieto, Marta Coca, Sophia Griese and Zaira Nogueira for helping in fieldwork \n\nand/or recruitment counts.

Under predictive scenarios of global warming it \n\nis important to understand the likely changes in distribution, dispersal ability and population structure \n\nof marine species, especially those that are commercially exploited. Here, the effect of water \n\ntemperature on larval development of Patella candei (d\u2019Orbigny 1840) from Azores (NE Atlantic) was \n\nexamined under controlled laboratory conditions. Three temperatures that are usually experienced in \n\nthe waters surrounding the archipelago throughout the year were used (14\u00baC, 18\u00baC and 22\u00baC). Both \n\nthe duration of larval development and larval survivorship were significantly affected by temperature. \n\nLarval development was faster at increasing temperatures and cumulative survivorship decreased; \n\nabout 25% of larvae at 22\u00baC survived to the end of the experiment, a 2-fold decrease from the \n\naverage survivorship of ~ 50% at 14\u00baC. As sea surface temperatures continue to rise, embryos and \n\nlarvae of P. candei will be subject to a deleterious effect, probably reducing the dispersal capacity and \n\nthe recovery potential of exploited populations of P. candei throughout the region. Experimental trials \n\non larval development provide valuable information that may be used to refine current and future \n\ntransport models for geographically-isolated, exploited limpets such as P. candei under changing \n\nenvironmental conditions, helping to adjust conservation and resource-management actions aimed at \n\nprotecting such important and endemic resources. \n\n  \n\nKEYWORDS: climate change, ocean warming, dispersal, larvae development, free-spawning \n\ninvertebrates \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nManuscript in preparation as: \n\nFaria J, Martins GM, Hawkins SJ, Neto AI, Ribeiro PA. In prep. Larval development of the limpet \n\nPatella candei at varying water temperatures: implications under global warming. \n\n\n\n\t 140 \n\n1. Introduction \n\nWide-ranging evidence shows that ocean warming has been taking place for the last decades (IPCC \n\n2014) and current trends emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of \n\neffects on global marine species and communities. The energetic metabolism of living organisms is \n\nlargely dependent on temperature (Brown et al. 2004), being affected by both unfavourably high and \n\nunfavourably low temperatures. Thus ocean warming is likely to affect the development, growth and \n\nmetabolic traits of individuals, thereby, influencing the distribution, abundance, population dynamics \n\nand reproductive timing of species (see reviews in Helmuth et al. 2006; Byrne 2011). This will \n\ninevitably lead to changes in the functioning of many marine ecosystems, with some species probably \n\nfacing extinction while others will thrive (see Hawkins et al. 2009; Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno 2010). \n\nIn particular, early life-stages of free-spawning marine invertebrates can be especially vulnerable to \n\nclimatic fluctuations and strongly influencing subsequent life-history stages (Gosselin and Qian 1996, \n\n1997). In fact, larvae represent a physiological bottleneck, as they are generally more sensitive to \n\nthermal, nutritional and other environmental stresses than their conspecific adults (Anger 2001). For \n\ninstance, numerous studies on the pace of developmental constraints, swimming performance, \n\nphysiology and planktonic larval duration (PLD) have showed that temperature acts as a major \n\nenvironmental factor controlling invertebrate development (e.g. Anger et al. 2003; Bassim and \n\nSammarco 2003; Green and Fisher 2004; Brennand et al. 2010; Arnberg et al. 2013; David and Simon \n\n2014). Although the response of experimentally-reared marine invertebrate embryos and larvae under \n\ndistinct temperature regimes varied between species and studies (Negri et al. 2007; Byrne 2012), \n\nincreasing temperature has a generalised pervasive stimulatory effect on metabolism until lethal levels \n\nare reached (see Supporting information in O\u2019Connor et al. 2007). This has important consequences \n\nfor a range of ecological attributes including larval dispersal, population connectivity, local adaptation, \n\nand speciation in marine biota. Given that the duration of the larval period is known to influence larval \n\ndispersal distance and survival, which in turn are positively correlated with population connectivity \n\n(Bohonak 1999), genetic structure is likely to be higher in warmer waters, or can increase under the \n\npredicted scenario of ocean warming. In fact, a positive correlation between latitude and connectivity \n\namong species has been previously detected in polyplacophoran molluscs, with species at lower \n\nlatitudes generally having more isolated (hence structured) populations (e.g. Kelly and Eernisse 2007). \n\nThis pattern is probably driven by faster larval development in warmer waters reducing the duration of \n\nthe dispersive pelagic stage and consequently the connectivity among populations, by limiting the \n\ndispersal potential of the species. Although such observations may not be extended to all living taxa, \n\nas many other factors can be involved, understanding the way temperature influences the \n\ndevelopment of early live-stages can provide valuable information to more realistic biophysical models \n\nof dispersal of free-spawning marine invertebrates (e.g. Paris et al. 2013). The ability to assess the \n\ndegree of demographic connectivity over ecological and evolutionary time frames, through the \n\nidentification of putative barriers to dispersal and range limitations, will definitely aid the re-shaping of \n\npresent-day marine reserves, while fostering better management strategies under expected scenarios \n\nof climatic changes. \n\n\n\n\t 141 \n\nThe endemic limpet Patella candei (d\u2019Orbigny 1840) is distributed across the Macaronesia \n\narchipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries. For discussion of taxonomic status within each \n\narchipelago see Faria et al. (2017). Although there are many references in the literature to studies on \n\nthe reproduction of intertidal gastropods, very little is known about the development, morphology and \n\nenvironmental requirements of P. candei larvae. Most available information is derived from other \n\nPatella congeners for which the development and reproductive cycle have been described (i.e. Orton \n\net al. 1956; Bowman and Lewis 1986; Espinosa et al. 2002; McCarthy et al. 2008; Ribeiro 2008; \n\nRibeiro et al. 2009; Prusina et al. 2014). In Azores, P. candei is known to be mostly a winter-breeder, \n\nalthough recruits can be found throughout the year (see Chapter 6). Although simultaneous \n\nhermaphroditic individuals have been found before and likely associated to a one-time aberration \n\n(Cunha et al. 2007), sexes in P. candei are separated and fertilization is external. When reproductively \n\nactive, mature male and female gametes are released directly into the water column, and upon \n\nfertilization, larvae undertake a series of development stages until they settle and recruit in suitable \n\nsubstrata. Because ocean warming is likely to influence larval duration, dispersal and survival, this \n\nstudy aims to investigate the influence of temperature on larval development of P. candei. This will \n\nimprove our ability to predict P. candei larval dynamics throughout its distributional area under \n\nprojected scenarios of ocean warming, and may help to re-design protective management measures. \n\n \n\n2. Methods \n\n2.1. Collection and treatment of gametes \n\nExperimental treatments were carried out in wintertime, from November 2015 to March 2016, to \n\nensure that sampling could take place during P. candei reproductive peak in Azores (see Chapter 6 \n\nand Vale 2016), thereby increasing the chances of collecting individuals with fully mature gonads. A \n\ntotal of 50 individuals of P. candei (shell length > 30 mm) were collected from a rocky shore platform in \n\nS\u00e3o Miguel island, Azores (37\u00ba443\u20199.33\u2019\u2019N - 25\u00ba38\u201920.94\u2019\u2019W). Individuals were kept alive and \n\nimmediately transported to the laboratory in a cool box for processing. Limpets were then dissected to \n\ndetermine their sex through gonad colouration and the gonads were staged following the semi-\n\nquantitative scale of Orton et al. 1956 (Fig. 1). Only individuals showing a fully developed gonad \n\n(stage V) were selected for in-vitro fertilization trials. For sperm stock, male gonads were carefully \n\npunctured and a few ?l of undiluted sperm were added to 500 ml of filtered and UV sterilised seawater \n\n(FSW). The solution was filtered through a 300 ?m mesh to remove gonad debris and then allowed to \n\nrest for 30 minutes (sperm is immobile and becomes active when in contact with seawater for a certain \n\nperiod of time). Sperm motility and concentration were checked in a Neubauer chamber (chamber \n\ndepth 0.1 mm) under an optical microscope. The treatment of individual limpets and larvae was \n\nperformed under room temperature (~ 19\u00baC) and sterilized conditions were maintained throughout the \n\nentire procedure. Sperm stock solution was used within the hour. The same ripening/ filtering \n\napproach was performed on stage V female gonads. Because oocyte/egg alkalinisation is known to \n\nimprove fertilization rates (see Hodgson et al. 2007; P\u00e9rez et al. 2016), clean oocytes were placed for \n\n2 hours in 500 ml FSW with pH = 9.0 (adjusted with NH4OH) before fertilization trials. \n\n\n\n\t 142 \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Diagrammatic representation of gonad development stages in Patella (adapted from Orton et al. 1956). This semi-\n\nquantitative scale scores gonad development, ranging between empty neuters (sex and gonad indistinguishable) to fully \n\ndeveloped gonads (stage V). In P. candei, female gonads are dark brown, whereas in males, the gonad is yellow to orange.  \n\n \n\n2.2. Experimental procedure \n\nFertilization experiments were performed under controlled conditions of light and temperature using \n\nthree environmental test chambers (SANYO). Given the sea surface temperature range in the Azores \n\nthroughout the year (roughly ranging from 14\u00baC to 22\u00baC), three constant water temperatures were \n\nselected for fertilization trials: 14, 18 and 22\u00baC. In each case, a gentle airflow system and a 12:12 h \n\nday/night cycle was applied for a total of three rearing replicates. In each replicate, batches of cleaned \n\neggs (pre-treated in pH 9 FSW) were placed in 100 ml FSW glass beakers, for a final concentration of \n\n~ 70 eggs ml-1. To achieve higher fertilization rates (see Hodgson et al. 2007), a pre-adjusted sperm \n\nstock volume was added to each beaker so that a final concentration of ~ 106 sperm ml-1 was \n\nachieved. The average stage of development in each replicate culture was determined by visual \n\nexamination of larvae under a microscope of three 1ml subsamples taken at pre-defined times (T: 1 h, \n\n2 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h and 72 h). Before sampling, cultures were gently stirred to \n\nhomogenise the distribution of larvae in the water. Samples were placed in 1.5 ml tubes and fixed with \n\none drop of 5% formalin. In all samples, the numbers of unfertilized eggs, embryo on initial process of \n\ncell division (cleavage) with 2-4 blastomeres, morula, swimming trochophore and pre- and post-\n\ntorsional veliger were recorded. After 45 h upon fertilization, larvae were fed periodically (24 h \n\nintervals) with Phaedactylum tricornutum (preliminary trials showed that P. candei larvae are \n\nplanktotrophic). Moreover, after each sampling event, a 64 ?m mesh filter was carefully used to decant \n\nlarvae onto 100 ml of freshly made FSW. The FSW was previously stored at each experimental \n\ntemperature, so as to avoid temperature oscillations during water changes. \n\n \n\n2.3. Statistical analyses \n\nFor each sampling time, chi-square tests were used to evaluate the relationship between stages of \n\ndevelopment (STAGE) and temperature (TEMP). Moreover, differences between treatments were \n\nexamined using a 2-way permutational ANOVA with the following factors: TEMP (3 levels; fixed) and \n\nSTAGE (6 levels; fixed). All tests were done using PERMANOVA+ based on Euclidean distances and \n\nusing 999 permutations (Anderson et al. 2008). Prior to analyses, data were checked for homogeneity \n\nof variance and transformations were applied when needed (Underwood 1997). Analyses were \n\n\n\n\t 143 \n\nperformed on untransformed data when attempts to stabilize variances through transformation were \n\nunsuccessful; in such cases, a more conservative significance level (? = 0.01) was used when testing \n\nfor differences (Underwood 1997). Pairwise tests were used to resolve significant differences within \n\nstages. Survival rates were determined for all temperatures at every pre-defined time. \n\n \n\n3. Results \n\nThis study showed, for the first time, that P. candei larvae are planktotrophic as they were observed \n\nfeeding on diatoms. Experimental trials were therefore conducted on feeding larvae. As expected, the \n\nsequence of development stages observed in this study was similar to others related limpet species \n\n(Dodd 1957; Wanninger et al. 1999; Espinosa et al. 2002; Ribeiro 2008). Upon fertilization, embryos \n\nundergo a series of cleavages before they develop into the so-called trochophore larvae typical for \n\nmolluscs. They are pear-shaped and girdled by a ring of cilia that enables them to swim actively, both \n\nhorizontally and vertically, with steady swimming often alternated with abrupt bursts of speed. Before \n\nthey can metamorphose into the adult form, the trochophore develops into a pre and post-torsional \n\nveliger. The trochophore-veliger transition involves torsion, which is the clockwise turn of the visceral \n\nportion relative to the head-foot portion (Ghiselin 1966), the development of embryonic shell and \n\nformation of the operculum. Upon completion of torsion, veligers are able to withdraw into their shells, \n\nexhibit cephalic tentacles, both eyespots are clearly noticeable and the foot is developed. The latter \n\nwill be used to adhere to the substrate during the settlement of competent larvae. Unfortunately, \n\ncomplete mortality occurred at all temperatures after T = 72 h within the post-veliger stage, and final \n\nmetamorphoses were not observed. \n\nWith the exception of T = 6 h, chi-square tests revealed that, the observed proportion of larval \n\ndevelopment stages at each sampling time were not independent of temperature (Table S1). \n\nMoreover, significant interaction terms were detected in most ANOVA analyses (except in T= 6 h and \n\nT = 12 h; Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). Generally, the proportion of early stages decreased with time and this \n\nwas more evident at increasing temperatures. Later stages (i.e. trochophore and veligers) were also \n\nfound sooner at higher temperatures (Fig. 2). For instance, larvae at 14\u00baC took more than twice the \n\ntime to reach the veliger state then at 22\u00baC (median development time was estimated as the time \n\nrequired by at least 50% of the observed larvae to reach a given stage). \n\nIn addition to an acceleration in development, a greater cumulative percentage of embryos and larvae \n\nexhibited abnormal development at higher temperatures. Although no significant differences were \n\ndetected in instantaneous survival rates across temperatures (identical slopes), the cumulative \n\nsurvivorship decreased in time and was consistently lower at higher temperatures (Fig. 3; Table 1). \n\nFor example, about 25% of larvae survived until the end of experiment (72 h) at 22\u00baC, about half the \n\naverage survival (~ 50%) recorded at 14\u00baC. Differences found among temperatures were mainly \n\ndetermined at initial stages of development (Fig. 3). \n\n \n\n\n\n\t 144 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Discussion \n\nThis study tested the response of P. candei embryos and larvae to temperature conditions that are \n\nusually experienced in the waters surrounding the archipelago of Azores throughout the year (Amorim \n\net al. 2017). Being winter brooders, P. candei larvae in Azores are expected to perform better and \n\nattain higher fitness at colder temperatures. In fact, results showed that development was accelerated \n\nbut the percentage of developmental abnormalities increased at higher temperatures, negatively \n\naffecting the cumulative survivorship of larvae. Consequently, as sea surface temperatures continue to \n\nrise, embryos and larvae of P. candei will be subject to a deleterious effect, likely reducing the time \n\nwindow each year for successful reproduction and larval development. Thus recruitment and the \n\nrecovery potential of exploited populations of P. candei will be diminished throughout its distribution \n\narea. Relatively small perturbations in recruitment can translate to large alterations of adult \n\npopulations (Uthicke et al. 2009). If these are accompanied by high levels of exploitation, the \n\nresilience and survival of the species can be greatly threatened. Therefore, understanding the exact \n\ncapacity of a given species to disperse under distinct environmental conditions is especially important \n\nin fisheries planning and implementation of conservation measures. Unfortunately, due to poor rearing \n\nconditions or intrinsic limitations while culturing invertebrate larvae in vitro (e.g. proliferation of \n\npathogens; excessive larval manipulation during water changes; larval density constraints), the final \n\nmetamorphosis stage was never detected, and the full extent of the PLD in P. candei could not be \n\ndetermined. However, increasing the larval development rate in P. candei under increasing \n\ntemperatures, will likely reduce the full potential of dispersal and population connectivity, with \n\nindividuals recruiting more locally near their source adult populations, hence increasing structure \n\namong populations. At the very least, results indicate that the PLD of P. candei is over three days; in \n\nall experimental conditions, actively swimming larvae were observed 3 days (72 h) after fertilization \n\nand before full larvae mortality occurred. This estimate, however, can be further reduced. For \n\ninstance, Ribeiro (2008) showed that patellid larvae accelerate their development and reach \n\nmetamorphosis faster when in the presence of their preferred settling substrata (i.e. crustose red \n\nalgae-covered stones) supporting other earlier studies showing that metamorphosis can only be \n\nachieved if suitable settlement inducers are present (Smith 1935; Dodd 1957). \n\nWhile the relatively cold adapted and planktotrophic nature of P. candei larvae in Azores may suggest \n\na broader geographic distribution of the species throughout the NE Atlantic region, current populations \n\nare restricted to the archipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries, and even these exhibit striking \n\ndissimilarities among them (Faria et al. 2017). As so, and aside from evolutionary and \n\nphylogeographic considerations, the suggestion that the PLD of P. candei might be shorter than \n\nexpected and the occurrence of oceanographic features such as eddies, currents, and meanders are \n\nlikely to be the most prominent factors limiting the connectivity capacity between populations of P. \n\ncandei among all archipelagos and elsewhere. Particular adaptations to each archipelago \n\nenvironmental conditions can also act to determine restrictions in population connectivity and \n\nindividual dispersal. The adaptability of P. candei to regional climate does not imply strict \n\ndependencies for the species throughout its area of distribution. The temperature dependence of \n\n\n\n\t 146 \n\nlarval development within a species may vary with latitude due to local adaptations of geographically \n\ndistant populations, a phenomenon that has been previously reported (Drent 2002). Due to, and also \n\nin support of the isolated nature of P. candei populations (see Faria et al. 2017), future research \n\nshould search for inter-specific variation in PLD at any given temperature across the entire distribution \n\nof P. candei sensu lato throughout the archipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries, and examine if \n\nan evidence for variation can be explained by specific metabolic adaptations to particular \n\nenvironmental conditions. Indeed, multi-population comparisons are urgently needed to better predict \n\npending ecosystem changes. \n\nThe observed pattern of sensitivity of P. candei to higher temperatures also explains the reproductive \n\ntiming of the species in Azores. As previously described (see Chapter 6), the yearly recruitment in P. \n\ncandei is known to peak between January and March, which implies the presence of larvae in open \n\nwaters a few days or weeks before, during the North hemisphere winter season. With monthly \n\ntemperatures ranging between 14 - 16\u00baC (Amorim et al. 2017), this time of the year seems to provide \n\nthe necessary and optimal temperature conditions for larvae to develop and survive. Moreover, \n\nalthough growth was not measured in this study, P. candei larvae at colder temperatures may be less \n\ndeveloped at a given size, but are more likely to settle at smaller sizes than larvae reared in warmer \n\nconditions (e.g. Laurel et al. 2014). Yet, if larval rearing could have been performed under colder \n\ntemperatures, the relationship between temperature and survivorship would likely follow a dome-\n\nshaped curve, as lower temperatures outside the species optimal range would also reduce the survival \n\nof individuals (Munday et al. 2009). \n\nThe effect of temperature on the developmental rate of marine invertebrates has long been recognized \n\nwith many studies showing that increasing temperatures accelerate larval development and provide a \n\ndeleterious effect to larval survivorship (e.g. Anil et al. 2001; Thiyagarajan et al. 2003; Randall and \n\nSzmant 2009; Bashevkin and Pechenik 2015). In some cases, however, warmer temperatures may \n\nprovide favourable conditions to the early life stages of free-spawning marine invertebrates, as \n\nincreasing growth rates will make larvae larger and less vulnerable to size-specific predation \n\n(Bashevkin and Pechenik 2015; Miller et al. 1988). Nevertheless, the PLD of a given species will be \n\ninevitably affected if temperatures are likely to increase. For instance, the relationship between PLD \n\nand temperature derived by O\u2019Connor et al. (2007), based on 69 species of invertebrates and fish of \n\nmostly temperate distribution, shows that an increase of 1\u00b0C from 14 to 15\u00b0C should decrease PLD by \n\n~ 10% and a 3\u00b0C temperature increase from 14 to 17\u00b0C should decrease PLD by ~ 25.5%. Although \n\ntemperature may be the single most important factor determining development and growth rates of \n\nearly life stages in marine invertebrates, the capacity of adult populations to be replenished by new \n\nindividuals is dependent on a vast number of factors (e.g. larval supply; food availability) that can act \n\ncollectively in determining the eventual distribution and abundance of a species (Cowen and \n\nSponaugle 2009). In order to assess the potential outcomes for P. candei in a changing ocean, future \n\nstudies should include multiple stressors experiments on larval development, tolerance and \n\nsurvivorship, and assess the interactive effects of factors such as temperature, salinity and food \n\navailability on larval success. These should not only focus on various life-history stages, but also \n\ndifferent populations of a species (Helmuth et al. 2006). This study emphasizes the importance of \n\n\n\n\t 147 \n\nincluding larval development information in models attempting to predict the effects of climate change \n\non species distributions. Such data may be used to refine current and future transport models for \n\nexploited limpets such as P. candei under changing environmental conditions in the North Atlantic \n\narchipelagic region, helping in adjusting conservation and resource-management actions aimed at \n\nprotecting such important and endemic resource. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nWe thank Zaira Nogueira for field and laboratory assistance during the course of rearing experiences. \n\nJF was funded by a PhD grant M3.1.2/ F/021/2011 by the Regional Government of the Azores. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAmorim P, Per\u00e1n AD, Pham CK, Juliano M, Cardigos F, Tempera F, Morato T (2017) Overview of the \n\nocean climatology and its variability in the Azores region of the North Atlantic including environmental \n\ncharacteristics at the seabed.

This thesis had three major \n\nobjectives that included the analysis of genetic, recruitment and larval development variability; these \n\nthree aspects are crucial in providing a holistic understanding of the dynamics and resilience to \n\nexploitation of these populations. \n\nFor the first time, species-specific microsatellite genetic markers for both species were developed. A \n\ntotal of 12 and 17 markers were characterized for P. candei and P. aspera, respectively [Chapter 2 \n\n(Faria et al. 2016) and Chapter 3 (Faria et al. 2015)]. These were amplified in optimized multiplex \n\nreactions and used to investigate species\u2019 genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity \n\nacross Azores, Madeira and Canaries archipelagos [Chapter 4 (Faria et al. 2017a) and Chapter 5 \n\n(Faria et al. 2017b)]. On top of evolutionary and ecological considerations, genetic analyses also \n\nprovided important information of applied interest for the management of the fishery across the region.  \n\nSecondly, a monitoring programme to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in recruitment of \n\nP. candei was established (Chapter 6). Genetic and recruitment data, along with other aspects of the \n\nreproductive cycle of the species, provide vital information for the fine-tuning of conservation actions \n\naimed at fostering the sustainable exploitation of the resource (e.g. seasonal fishing closures). The \n\nfine scale of the monitoring programme also allowed exploring the relative importance of \n\nenvironmental conditions (e.g. sea surface temperatures) in driving temporal and spatial variation in \n\nrecruitment and identifying the relevant scale at which physical processes are coupled with larval \n\nrecruitment.  \n\nThirdly, an experimental rearing procedure was established to investigate the influence of temperature \n\non larval development of P. candei (Chapter 7). Understanding the role of temperature on larval \n\ndevelopment is not only important to foresee any developmental changes expected under current \n\npredictions of future climate change, but also to produce high-resolution bio-physical models that are \n\nable to simulate and model larval transport in its natural environment, following its life-history traits, \n\nassessing at the same time the role of transport in regulating population connectivity, and the role of \n\ndifferent biological and physical factors on dispersal. \n\nThe main findings can be briefly summarized as follows: \n\n\u2022 Twelve microsatellite markers were developed for Patella candei; \n\n\n\n\t 159 \n\n\u2022 Seventeen microsatellite markers were developed for Patella aspera; \n\n\u2022 Low genetic diversity was detected for both species across the Macaronesian archipelagos of \n\nAzores, Madeira and Canaries; \n\n\u2022 Morphological differentiation among archipelagos was detected in P. candei; \n\n\u2022 Populations of P. candei from each archipelago are genetically differentiated and/or \n\necologically isolated; \n\n\u2022 Populations of P. aspera from Azores are genetically distinct from those of Madeira and \n\nCanaries; \n\n\u2022 There was no evidence for population genetic structure within archipelago (i.e. among islands \n\nin Azores) for any of the species studied; \n\n\u2022 High inbreeding in P. aspera is likely a consequence of human harvesting; \n\n\u2022 A marked peak in recruitment of P. candei occurred during winter/spring months and was \n\nfound to be positively associated with significant wave height; \n\n\u2022 Increasing temperature significantly shortens the time required for larval development in P. \n\ncandei, but negatively affects its survivorship. \n\n \n\nGenetic diversity, population structure and connectivity of limpets in Macaronesia \n\nThe observed levels of genetic variability of P. candei and P. aspera populations throughout \n\nMacaronesia were relatively low when compared to other patellid species inhabiting the mainland (e.g \n\nPerez et al. 2007; Ribeiro et al. 2010). Whether this is a consequence of the isolated nature of \n\npopulations inhabiting remote oceanic islands and/or the influence of over-harvesting, the relatively \n\nimpoverished genetic diversity observed in both species may render them more susceptible to \n\nenvironmental changes. On the one hand, it is not uncommon that small, isolated populations and/or \n\npopulations at the range edges, exhibit relatively lower levels of genetic diversity compared to more \n\nconnected populations, or those living in the middle of the species range, both on neutral or non-\n\nneutral markers, and that insular populations have less genetic variation than their mainland \n\ncounterparts (Frankham 1997). If dispersal between mainland and insular populations is completely \n\nrestricted, then genetic variability in such populations can only be regenerated via mutation, with \n\ngenetic drift and inbreeding playing a dominant role on reducing such variability (Frankham 1996). \n\nMoreover, under limited availability and variability of suitable niches, isolated populations will often \n\nexhibit very specific and localised adaptive traits (for review on local adaptations see Sanford and \n\nKelly 2011), and therefore their potential to adapt to any environmental changes may be narrow (or \n\nbeneficial, when considering local adaptation as a direct evidence that species are capable of evolving \n\nin the face of environmental change; see overview in Conover 1998). In such cases, the \u2018raw material\u2019, \n\nhence genetic variation, for evolutionary change is restricted and isolated populations become more \n\nsusceptible to demographic and environmental stochasticity processes and changes (e.g. Eldridge et \n\n\n\n\t 160 \n\nal. 1999). Considering the Macaronesia region and given the environmental particularities of each \n\narchipelago, patellid populations are likely to have preserved distinct adaptive traits and subsets of \n\nalleles; if individuals could migrate freely among archipelagos, one would have expected more \n\ngenetically diverse populations. On the other hand, the anthropogenic pressure on populations, \n\nthrough the constant removal of individuals, may negatively affect the genetic pool of limpets, leading \n\nto putative deleterious effects on the species adaptive potential and survivorship (see Walsh et al. \n\n2006; Allendorf and Hard 2009). This is further enhanced by the isolated nature of populations. For \n\ninstance, the induced genetic changes created by the size-biased removal of individuals in P. aspera \n\npopulations, and given the species specific life-history traits, provides a good example of how humans, \n\nvia harvesting, can influence the genetic composition of populations (Faria et al. 2017b; Smith et al. \n\n1991; Hauser et al. 2002; Pinsky and Palumbi 2014). \n\nTwo major aspects were revealed following population structure analyses of P. candei and P. aspera \n\nsamples across the Macaronesia region: firstly, populations from Azores are genetically and probably \n\necologically isolated from those of Madeira and the Canaries; secondly, unrestricted migratory \n\nmovements associated to relaxed oceanographic barriers and adequate larval dispersal potential are \n\nlikely responsible for maintaining genetic homogeneity across patellid populations throughout the \n\narchipelago of Azores. Hence, patellid larvae are able to develop and disperse among islands, \n\nprobably contributing for a metapopulation status of limpets in this remote archipelago. However, the \n\npresence of genetic homogeneity among populations may not be fully indicative that the populations \n\nare significantly demographically connected. By definition, demographic connectivity considers that \n\nthe level of exchange must be sufficient to impact the demographic rates of the local population(s) \n\n(Lowe and Allendorf 2010); it is several orders of magnitude larger than the level of exchange required \n\nfor the maintenance of genetic homogeneity among subpopulations. Whereas relatively few migrants \n\n(or lots if populations are very large) among subpopulations can lead to genetic homogeneity (e.g. \n\nD\u00edaz-Viloria et al. 2009; Goldstien et al. 2009; Hellberg 2009), the proportion of migrants necessary to \n\nlead to a significant demographic connectivity among populations, although arbitrary, needs to be \n\nhigher and occur frequently (i.e. in most years, Hawkins et al. 2016). Such demographic connectivity \n\nof meta-populations is strongly dependent on conditions such as larval dispersal, habitat quality, adult \n\ndensity and mortality on recipient populations. Just because two populations are genetically \n\nundifferentiated does not necessarily mean they are connected by consistent gene flow events (e.g. \n\nare P. aspera populations in Madeira and Canaries truly connected?). This level of uncertainty has \n\nstrong implications for conservation purposes, and highlights the importance of complementing \n\ngenetic data with population dynamics and demography studies to understand whether a natural \n\nsystem fits a metapopulation model or not (see Lamy et al. 2012). \n\nDespite the relatively short geographic distance between Madeira and Canaries, there was a \n\nsignificant genetic and morphological distinction among P. candei populations from these \n\narchipelagos. Without any major recognisable oceanographic barriers, one would expect that \n\nSelvagens, which stands almost in the middle of these two archipelagos, would work as a stepping-\n\nstone habitat, allowing the movement of individuals and facilitating connectivity among archipelagos. \n\nInterestingly, unlike that found for P. candei, there was no evidence of genetic structuring in \n\n\n\n\t 161 \n\npopulations of P. aspera from Madeira and Canaries. Species-specific life-history traits (e.g. pelagic \n\nlarval duration, larval behaviour) and differences in the evolutionary history of each species (e.g. \n\ndistinct times and routes of colonisation, possible secondary contact events, etc.) are likely to be \n\nresponsible for such patterns. Additionally, the particular environmental characteristics associated to \n\neach species preferred habitat (i.e. P. aspera is mainly a subtidal species and P. candei is mostly \n\ndistributed at mid-shore levels) may have also been accountable in determining the within-species \n\ndifferentiation observed; it is possible that P. aspera has found more underwater habitat (i.e. shallow \n\nseamounts) during its evolution so as to allow a more efficient stepping stone between Madeira and \n\nCanaries, which could explain the apparent lack of genetic structure between the two archipelagos. \n\nMoreover, in contrast to the relatively stable conditions that P. aspera individuals experience \n\nunderwater, P. candei habitats are more diverse, complex and heterogeneous, exposed to a large \n\nrange of climatic conditions; to cope with such conditions, adaptive processes associated with niche \n\ndifferentiation are more likely to have happen in P. candei than in P. aspera. Indeed, the existence of \n\ntwo distinct habitat-related morphs of P. candei (referred for the Azores: the \u2018fly limpet\u2019 and the \n\n\u2018smooth limpet\u2019 lend support to this argument. Indeed, adaptive differentiation among marine \n\ninvertebrates is not uncommon (Hauser and Carvalho 2008), with populations often evolving varying \n\ntolerances over a broad range of spatial scales to alongshore gradients of environmental factors that \n\ninclude salinity and pollution (e.g. Sokolova and Boulding 2004; Untersee and Pechenik 2007), vertical \n\nstresses associated to the intertidal zone (e.g. Janson 1982; Schmidt et al. 2000; Pardo and Johnson \n\n2005), and wave exposure gradients (e.g. Struhsaker 1968; Kirby et al. 1994). \n\nAlthough geographical distance per se can have possibly influenced differentiation of both P. aspera \n\nand P. candei throughout the Macaronesia, the influence of other processes such as the historical \n\nshifting of ocean circulation (Haug and Tiedemann 1998), the current oceanographic complexity \n\n(Johnson and Stevens 2000) as well as mesoscale variability across the region (Barton 2001) cannot \n\nbe discarded and may have played an important role in limiting gene exchange among archipelagos, \n\nboth at historical and contemporary scales. Other factors affecting larval development and dispersion \n\nmay have also acted to produce the observed differentiation among archipelagos. For instance, at \n\ncertain temperatures the final stage of larval development before metamorphosis in P. candei can be \n\nachieved in just 3 days upon fertilization (see Chapter 7) suggesting that the putative pelagic larval \n\nduration (PLD) may not be fully realized, and that larvae may be unable to reach far distant-\n\npopulations (i.e. among archipelagos); larval longevity is still undetermined but may be shorter than \n\nexpected considering other patellid limpets (i.e. studies in other patellids indicate a PLD up to 27 days; \n\nsee Ribeiro 2008). Moreover, a considerable number of larvae may be retained near spawning sites \n\ndue to behavioural preferences, with larval dispersion only occurring during weather extremes acting \n\nat a regional scale (i.e. within archipelago). Significant barriers to gene flow, either biological or \n\nphysical-induced, are likely to have prompted isolation among archipelagos allowing evolution to take \n\nits own course, free of influence from other areas, resulting in the allopatric divergence of populations \n\n(Losos and Ricklefs 2009). The P. candei complex seems to constitute a good example of such \n\ncommon form of speciation (Faria et al. 2017a). \n\n\n\n\t 162 \n\nAlthough the number of studies addressing marine population connectivity has grown significantly in \n\nthe past decades, there are still many uncertainties about the extent to which larvae are able to \n\ndisperse among populations. This is mostly a consequence of the difficulty in tracking larvae in such \n\nan open system that is vast and complex. Although tags can be applied to some species to provide a \n\nmeans to directly measure larval movement (e.g. Jones et al. 1999; Almany et al. 2007), there is still \n\nmuch to be done and understood about processes and factors affecting dispersal, population \n\nstructuring and connectivity. Understanding how population genetic structure is formed and evolves in \n\nspace and time is therefore a challenging task and often restricted by our ability to fully address the \n\ncomplexity and interactive nature of all processes involved. The integration of genetic data with \n\nbiological, ecological and environmental information, as provided by this thesis, offers better insights \n\ninto the evolutionary mechanisms that have led species to their current distributions, pinpointing \n\naspects about their dynamics, perseverance and survival in time. \n\n \n\nRecruitment and the influence of environmental variables \n\nThere is no doubt that the rate of input of new individuals into population is a key aspect of population \n\ndynamics, especially when considering marine exploited species, where population persistency \n\nfollows a thin balance between individuals that are removed by harvesting and individuals that are \n\nadded to the population via recruitment. Clearly not all individuals arriving at a recruitment habitat will \n\nhave equal chances of surviving. Instead individual recruit performance will depend on dispersal \n\nhistories and carry-over effects leading to intra-specifically variable phenotypes that may or may not \n\nreach reproductive stages (for overview see Caley et al. 1996). \n\nThe monitoring programme, spatially and temporally replicated, performed in Chapter 6, allowed to \n\nassess the levels of recruitment of the exploited limpet P. candei in Azores. Recruitment was recorded \n\nthroughout the year but its intensity varied in space and time. In general, a marked peak in recruitment \n\noccurred during winter/spring months, when sea surfaces temperatures were lower and wave \n\nturbulence higher. In fact, there was a significant correlation between limpet recruitment and sea \n\nsurface temperature, significant wave height, wave period and wave direction. While each of these \n\nenvironmental variables may have influenced recruitment on its own, significant wave height was \n\nprobably the most important factor triggering the recruitment of P. candei, since it was the only \n\nvariable that accounted for inter-annual variation in recruitment levels. Additional sampling over longer \n\ntime frames will likely support these findings and may help identify long-term patterns of recruitment \n\nvariation and how they can be influenced by future and predicted environmental changes associated \n\nto global change. Moreover, in this study patterns of recruitment were restricted to four locations in \n\none island; if possible, future research should include the monitoring of recruits and reproductive traits \n\nat several locations across the region (including other islands) to detect synchronised and/or \n\nasynchronous events. This would highlight aspects related to metapopulation processes and source-\n\nsink dynamics among islands and/or subpopulations within each archipelago. Given that the viability of \n\na population may depend on surrounding populations, this information would greatly benefit the \n\ndelineation of conservation strategies and reserve spatial planning (Ak\u00e7akaya et al. 2007). \n\n\n\n\t 163 \n\n \n\nTemperature influence in limpet larval development \n\nNot surprisingly, temperature was found to influence the development in P. candei larvae (see Chapter \n\n7) and therefore changes in ocean temperature will likely have an impact on larval dispersal and \n\npopulation connectivity. Populations will become more dependent on local recruitment for \n\nreplenishment, and thus more vulnerable to severe population fluctuations and extinction (Eckert \n\n2003); first, rising sea temperature will promote the shortening of pelagic larval duration, which in turn \n\nmay reduce the time larvae spend on the water column and hence reduce the degree of larval \n\nexchange among populations; secondly, further rises in sea temperature may cause massive larval \n\nmortality and, eventually, prevent replenishment of the populations. Moreover, the \u2018preference\u2019 for \n\nlower temperatures is in agreement with the fact that P. candei in Azores is a winter-breeder recruiting \n\nmostly during the colder period of the year (see Chapters 6 and 7). \n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, and given the above mentioned influence of temperature in larval \n\ndevelopment, global warming since the last glacial period may have led to shorter larval development \n\ntimes and thus greater separation of limpet stocks in the Macaronesia among the various \n\narchipelagos, effectively promoting the isolation of archipelagos. Except for populations of P. aspera in \n\nMadeira and Canaries, this hypothesis would be in agreement with the genetic structure detected \n\nacross Macaronesia. \n\nFuture research should be conducted not only on P. candei but also on P. aspera and test the \n\nresponse of each species\u2019 larval development under isolated and combined effects of multiple abiotic \n\nstressors. This would provide valuable knowledge, which could be used to refine current and future \n\ntransport models for limpets in Macaronesia under distinct environmental conditions. Moreover, an \n\nadequate optimization of rearing conditions is needed to fully quantify the PLD in both P. candei and \n\nP. aspera. \n\n \n\nImplications for conservation and management \n\nThis PhD thesis highlights the complex nature of oceanic island connectivity and historical and \n\ncontemporary factors associated with it, while attempting to delineate adequate management units for \n\nthe conservation of highly exploited coastal invertebrates, such as P. candei and P. aspera in \n\nMacaronesia. It is known that conservation planning and species management can operate at many \n\nlevels, from whole ecosystems and communities down to individual organisms. At any one of these \n\nlevels, genetic approaches have proven to be powerful tools for revealing ecologically relevant insights \n\ninto marine population dynamics and informing conservation approaches and strategies. In fact, over \n\nthe last decades, the use of genetic data in conservation has become an important and expanding \n\ndiscipline with a strong theoretical framework. Yet, combining genetic data with information about the \n\necology, life-history traits and behavioural patterns of a species can provide a better and holistic \n\nunderstanding of population processes and how they influence each other (see Lowe and Allendorf \n\n\n\n\t 164 \n\n2010). This can greatly assist the development of management and conservation strategies to \n\nsafeguard current stocks. \n\nSo, are limpets resilient enough to overcome fishing pressure, given their oceanic isolation status? \n\nUnlikely! Especially for P. aspera, which is highly harvested. It is also a protandrous hermaphrodite \n\n(Martins et al. 1987) and collection is largely biased towards the larger (hence mostly females) \n\nindividuals; this size-selective harvesting can affect many different aspects of the life history and \n\necology of the species (e.g. Fenberg and Roy 2012) and has the potential to drastically skew sex \n\nratios (e.g. McGovern et al. 1998), sizes at sex change (e.g. Hawkins and Roberts 2004; Rivera-\n\nIngraham et al. 2011), population size structure (e.g. Branch 1975; Lasiak 1993; Branch and Moreno \n\n1994; Sagarin et al. 2007) and affect P. aspera reproductive output and maintenance of populations \n\n(e.g. Harding et al. 2007). Given its isolated status, if new individuals, or gene material for that matter, \n\nare not provided from elsewhere, local extinction is definitely likely. Harvesting-induced changes to the \n\ngenetic pool of the species (e.g. reduction in genetic diversity) are likely to become a major \n\ndisadvantage in the face of any environmental fluctuations. Moreover, recent demographic data \n\nsuggests that populations in many of the islands are already at very low sizes and if protective \n\nmeasures are not put in place, stocks will soon run out. It is likely that healthy and small pockets of \n\nindividuals at sites inaccessible by humans may exist, but the genetic and ecological consequences of \n\nthe intensive size-selective harvesting that is taking place may lead to local extinctions and ultimately \n\naffect the survival of the species (Fenberg and Roy 2008). Also, space availability is a major concern \n\nin P. aspera, which is mostly distributed at very low levels in the shore down to 20 m depths; here, \n\ncompetition for space, especially due to greater proliferation of macroalgae, limits the capacity of P. \n\naspera populations to settle and recruit (Boaventura et al. 2002, Martins et al. 2008). This effect is \n\nfurther intensified if limpets and other herbivores (e.g. sea urchins) are removed or absent (see \n\nColeman et al. 2006). Glints of hope for P. aspera populations do exist. For instance, a recent \n\nhypothesis suggests that males are compensating the removal of larger females by undergoing sex \n\nchange earlier and presumably at smaller sizes (Martins et al. 2017); although this adaptive and \n\nresilient response can balance the sex-ratio of the species, the amount of gametes released into the \n\nwater is drastically reduced with obvious negative consequences for the reproductive output of P. \n\naspera (see Faria et al. 2017b). \n\nAs for P. candei, although the isolated status of populations from each archipelago may naturally \n\nthreaten their survival (Frankham 1998), current information regarding its life-history traits and field \n\nobservational data suggests that P. candei is likely to withstand most environmental and \n\nanthropogenically-induced threats. First, P. candei is not as intensively harvested as P. aspera; \n\nsecondly, P. candei is a gonochoric species and individuals are known to reproduce at smaller sizes \n\nthan P. aspera, and thus avoid any size-selective harvesting consequences; finally, recruitment is \n\nmostly occurring on the upper eulittoral where space pre-emption is less likely compared to lower \n\nshore levels. Overall, the opportunistic behaviour of P. candei is likely to provide the species the \n\nnecessary resilience to face harvesting pressures and environmental changes. \n\n\n\n\t 165 \n\nSo, what recommendations can be made to promote better sustainable practices in limpet harvesting? \n\nAt the very least, conservation actions should follow the stock delimitation that is suggested by the \n\ngenetic data from this thesis, with two independent stocks of P. aspera (Azores and Madeira plus \n\nCanaries), and three stocks for P. candei, one per archipelago. Nevertheless, given that genetic \n\nmethods alone provide little information on demographic connectivity (Lowe and Allendorf 2010; \n\nHawkins et al. 2016), and that limpet populations in most islands seem rather depleted, immediate \n\nactions should take a more conservative approach and consider each island particular population \n\ndynamics together with regional stock delimitations. No-take marine reserves should be put in place \n\nacross islands and given that surveillance cannot be everywhere at any time, at least one of such \n\nareas per island should be constantly surveyed and monitored. For instance, the marine protected \n\narea (MPA) that includes the inner Caldeira of Monte da Guia at Faial island, Azores, which is a no-\n\ntake and no-entry area and highly surveyed by local authorities, constitutes a tantalizing indication of \n\nwhat rocky shores would be if limpets were not heavily exploited (Vale 2016).  \n\nIndeed, these no-take marine reserves are increasingly regarded as effective tools for the \n\nmanagement and conservation of marine ecosystems. Evidence of the positive effects of MPAs on the \n\nstructure of exploited (although not exclusively so) populations is accumulating in the scientific \n\nliterature (Halpern 2003; Sciberas et al. 2015). At population levels, these include increases in \n\nabundance, size and reproductive output as well as the restoration of population structure and sex-\n\nratios of targeted species. A successful MPA, however, is one that not only protects the species \n\nwithin, but also functions as source/provider of larvae and adults (spill-over effect) to adjacent areas \n\nthus contributing to population maintenance and genetic diversity at broader spatial scales. \n\nAdditionally, current legislation about seasonal fishing closures, minimum legal catch sizes and limpet \n\nprotection zones should be re-evaluated (for more specific details see Faria et al. 2017a, 2017b). For \n\ninstance, in the Azores, the most recent legislation regulating the amount of limpets collected by \n\nqualified catcher is of 80 kg per day of fresh-living weight (Portaria n\u00ba 73/2015). This seems an \n\nexcessive amount; for instance, let us consider the number of licensed catchers in S. Miguel island in \n\n2014 (16 catchers), the duration of the harvesting season (153 days), the average mass of individuals \n\nwith at least the minimum size allowed for harvesting (~ 15 g); and the total area where limpets may \n\nvirtually occur throughout the island (9.43 \u00d7 105  m2; excluding protected areas and considering that P. \n\naspera is mostly distributed from the very low shore to 5 m depth); if licensed individuals do max-out \n\ntheir catching limits, then each m2 should have at least a total of 14 limpets with the minimum size for \n\nharvesting (45 mm). Although this is a very rough estimate, as there are no scientific and spatially-\n\nexplicit data regarding the abundance of P. aspera below low tide levels, observational evidence \n\nsuggest that this threshold is well beyond current abundances on most rocky shores of S\u00e3o Miguel \n\nisland. Overall, the (arbitrary?) limit set by the current legislation seems counter-productive and does \n\nnot support the sustainable use of such ecological and economical important resource in the region. \n\nMoreover, stock integrity becomes further at risk due to illegal poaching and by recreational harvesters \n\nthat are allowed to collect 1.5 kg of limpets in the intertidal zone during weekends and holidays. \n\nUpdated and adequate population census and studies concerning the life-history, size structure and \n\n\n\n\t 166 \n\ngrowth patterns of limpets in Macaronesia are therefore urgently needed. For instance, a well-\n\nperformed study of P. aspera stock integrity in Madeira by Sousa et al. (2017) suggests that the \n\nspecies is currently under-exploited in the island. In comparison to Azores, harvesting regulations \n\nseem more restrictive; the number of licenses and daily capture quantities are more limiting than those \n\napplied in Azores. Although in the short-term, these regulations may be preventing P. aspera stock in \n\nMadeira from over-exploitation, the high demand for such resource in Azores (i.e. limpets caught in \n\nMadeira are often sold in the Azores), the low frequency of older individuals in the natural populations \n\nin Madeira (Sousa et al. 2017), and the lack of knowledge on connectivity processes among nearby \n\nislands and archipelagos, may negatively affect the susceptibility of the stock to fishing pressure. \n\nOverall, improving the scientific basis of stock identification and assessment requires the integration of \n\na broad spectrum of complementary techniques e.g. genetic methods, morphometrics, catch data, life-\n\nhistory characteristics, recruitment and population census, etc. (see Begg and Waldman 1999). These \n\nshould allow a more accurate determination of stock structure and populations dynamics of exploited \n\nspecies, a vital aspect for designing appropriate management and conservation regulations in \n\nfisheries. \n\n \n\nLimitations and Future Perspectives \n\nThis study would greatly benefit from a more extensive sampling approach, particularly with the \n\ninclusion of individuals/ populations from all islands across the Macaronesia where P. candei and P. \n\naspera occur. This would be especially important in the case of Selvagens, which are located between \n\nMadeira and Canaries archipelagos and though to hold some of the older/ancestral forms of Patella in \n\nthe Macaronesia region. Not only this would strengthen our understanding of genetic population \n\nstructure and connectivity processes, but would also provide a better insight into the evolutionary \n\nhistory of both P. candei and P. aspera across the region. Unfortunately, due to logistics constraints \n\nno such sampling could be performed for this thesis. \n\nTo increase our understanding about population dynamics, stock integrity and the identification of \n\nhistorical, environmental and biological factors influencing metapopulation connectivity, future \n\nresearch should follow a multidisciplinary approach by pairing genetic tools with more detailed \n\ninformation on larval and recruitment sampling, behavioural studies, natural tags and oceanographic \n\nsimulation. For each species and considering the genetic relationship among archipelagos detected in \n\nthis thesis, future work should be aimed at: \n\n\u2022 Increasing the spatial scale detection of recruitment levels across the region; \n\n\u2022 Testing larval development under distinct and combined environmental factors; \n\n\u2022 Combining modules of biological and physical nature to simulate and model larval transport in \n\nits natural environment, following its life-history traits, assessing at the same time the role of \n\ntransport in regulating population connectivity, and the role of different biological and physical \n\nfactors on limpet dispersal; \n\n\n\n\t 167 \n\n\u2022 Establishing yearly census programs to access the structure and demography of populations; \n\n\u2022 Investigating the role of limpet gene expression and transcriptome responses in adaptation to \n\nthe environmental particularities of each archipelago (i.e. thermal tolerance). \n\nAbove all, and given the endemic nature of P. candei and P. aspera and their isolation status within \n\nthe NE Atlantic archipelagos, stock conservation should follow an integrated management approach, \n\nprovided that stock management authorities and scientific community work together to find the best \n\nway to protect and guarantee the sustainable use of natural resources (i.e. limpets) across \n\narchipelagos. More generally, mitigating the effects of harvesting would require us to shift from \n\nmanagement strategies that are designed to maximize yield (Longhurst 2006) to those that can \n\npreserve the natural variations that characterize species and ecosystems. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAk\u00e7akaya HR, Mills G, Doncaster CP (2007) The role of metapopulations in conservation.
