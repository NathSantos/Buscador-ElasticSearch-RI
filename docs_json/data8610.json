INTRODUCTION\n\nThe area selected for this study, called the Bois River \nHeadwaters, located in the northwestern portion of the \nState of Goi\u00e1s (Brazil), makes up part of the Campinorte \nProject, between latitudes S 14\u00ba03\u2019 and 14\u00ba15\u2019 and longi-\ntude W 49\u00ba12\u2019 and 49\u00ba16\u2019 (Figure 1) and represents around \n75\u00a0km2. The access is facilitated by federal highway BR-153 \n(Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia), for approximately 300 km2, or the highway \nBrasilia-Barro Alto-Urua\u00e7u, both paved. The main towns in \nthe area of research are Mara Rosa and Campinorte.\n\nThis work was part of the dissertation conducted at the \nUniversity of Brasilia and proposes a revision in geological \n\ndata, lithogeochemical and mineral chemistry. The following \nobjectives guided the study: de?nition of the main granitic \nfacies in the area, its spatial distribution and petrographic char-\nacterization and lithogeochemistry the granite host rocks of \ngold mineralization; study phyllosilicates major phases (biotite \nand muscovite) granite-related paragenesis. In this study, lab-\noratory techniques were used such as petrographic analysis\u00a0of \ntransmitted and re?ected light, which served for the selection \nof preferred ?elds to study mineral chemistry of phyllosilicates. \nThis research was conducted at Microscopy Laboratory of the \nInstitute of Geosciences (University of Brasilia).\n\nFigure 1\n\nLocation map of the study area.\n\ndistintas dessas fases minerais, decorrentes das altera\u00e7\u00f5es hidrotermais.

GEOTECTONIC CONTEXT\n\nWithin a focus of geotectonic search, the region is \nlocated in the central portion of the Tocantins Structural \nProvince, whose tectonic partitioning for the eastern segment \ncomprises: Cratonic cover, Bras\u00edlia Belt, Goi\u00e1s Massif and \nWest Magmatic Arc of Goi\u00e1s, as Figure 2.\n\nThe Bras\u00edlia Belt occurs on the west border of the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco Craton, and this tectonic entity is a member of \nthe\u00a0Brasiliano-Pan African orogenic system formed during \nthe Neoproterozoic and comprising external and internal \nareas. The outer zone is composed of metasedimentary \nunits that basically groups Parano\u00e1, Canasta and forma-\ntions Ibi\u00e1 and Vazante, associations volcano-sedimentary, \nTicunzal formation, Arai group, Serra da Mesa and tinny \ngranites. These rocks overlap by reverse faults the group \nBambui deposited east.\n\nThe inner zone consists of basement areas and the \nGroup Arax\u00e1 associated with allochthonous units, and \n\nits southern portion has a structure made by overlapping \ntectonic nappes with system Arax\u00e1-Canasta. Internally to \nNeoproterozoic mobile belt basement blocks occur mainly \nArchean, represented by Median Massif of Goi\u00e1s, and the \nsearch area is located north of Hidrolina Block, possibly in \nthe areas of contact between the median Massif of Goi\u00e1s \nand the Arc Mara Rosa Magmatic.\n\nThe Median Goi\u00e1s Massif is a complex association \nof rocks of various types, being interpreted as a high sialic \nbasement in contact with mobile belt proterozoic (Marini \net\u00a0al. 1984), or as a complex collage of crustal fragments, \nincluding land pre- and Neoproterozoic Brasiliano areas \n(Fuck 1994). Comprises Archean greenstone-granite terrain, \nand volcano-sedimentary sequences. \n\nThe Goi\u00e1s Magmatic Arc, exposed and de?ned in \nwestern Goi\u00e1s, according to Pimentel &amp; Fuck (1992), \ncovers ortognaissics paleoproterozoic terranes and volca-\n\n52\u00ba00W 46\u00ba00W\n\n12\u00ba00S\n\n16\u00ba00S\n\n0 100 200(km)\n\nGB: GREENTONES BELTS\nCMU: COMPLEXO M\u00c1FICO-ULTRAM\u00c1FICO\nBA: Barro Alto; NI: Niquel\u00e2ndia; CA: Canabrava\n\nN\n\nFigure 2\n\nGeotectonic map of the study area.\n\n\n\n46\n\nGeology and geochemistry of Bois River Suite, Mara Rosa (GO): evidence of magmatic arc paleoproterozoic\n\nGeochimica Brasiliensis 28(1): 43-64, 2014\n\nno-sedimentary sequences Neoproterozoic, deformed and \nmetamorphosed in the amphibolite to greenschist facies. \nIn regions Aren\u00f3polis, Israel\u00e2ndia and Sanclerl\u00e2ndia the \nmagmatic arc is characterized by exposures of gneiss \nterrains orthoderivated with composition ranging from \ngabbro-dioritic to granodioritic. The volcano-sedimen-\ntary associations are represented by metavolcanic rocks \nranging in composition from tholeiitic basalts to rhyolites. \n\nThese units are intruded by granitoid metamorphic late \nto post-orogenics.\n\nThe continuity of the magmatic arc of western Goi\u00e1s \nnorthward is con?rmed by the existence of metavolcanic \nrocks and Neoproterozoic metaplutonic old Rose in Mara \nregion (Mara Rosa Magmatic Arc) with geochemical and \nisotopic signature similar to the west, suggesting the northern \nextension magmatic arc (Viana 1995).\n\n3. REGIONAL AND LOCAL GEOLOGY\n\nA summary of the regional geology was proposed by \nAbdallah (2001) and Abdallah and Botelho (2002), which \nwas developed to integrate geological data (Figure\u00a0 3) \n\nbased on ?eld work by enforcement of regional geolog-\nical pro?les.

(1991), Silva &amp; S\u00e1 (1988), Ribeiro Filho \n(1981) and Lacerda (1986).\n\nThe main lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic \nunits occurring within the Campinorte Project are: gran-\nite-greenstone terrain, psamo-pelitic (Santa Terezinha \nSequence), Serra da Mesa Group, Mara Rosa Sequence \nand intrusive granites of the Rio dos Bois Suite, this last \nthe object of this research.\n\nLithological associations with typical granite-green-\nstone terrains occupy a vast area of the southern portion \nof the Campinorte Project represented by Hidrolina \nDome, which, according to the definition of Danni and \nRibeiro (1978), constitutes portions of granitic basement \nof the Median Massif of Goi\u00e1s. This set features regional \ndistribution and lithologic homogeneity, becoming the \nleucocratic gneisses of granodioritic to tonalitic whose \ngneissic banding is defined by alternating levels of \nquartz-feldspathic and micaceous amphibolitic narrow \nbands, usually observed migmatitic features. In general, \nthe metamorphism is amphibolite facies, although min-\neral parageneses indicative of granulite facies can be \nverified. In general the region Hidrolina is compartmen-\ntalized into three major structural domains: shear zone, \ngranitic Hidrolina Dome and allochthonous fragments \nof Arax\u00e1 Group, according to Kuyumjian et\u00a0al. (2004).\n\nThe Santa Terezinha Sequence is a restricted portion \nmidwest, especially among Campinorte and Nova Igua\u00e7u \ncity. In this region, the sequence consists of a set of su-\npracrustal metasedimentary sequence, making tectonic \ncontacts with rocks Hidrolina Dome and drive west of \nMara Rosa Sequence. The main rocks of this sequence in \nthe region are garnet-chlorite-muscovite schists, quartz \nmuscovite schist, biotite schist and chlorite schist.\n\nThe Santa Terezinha Sequence represents the whole \nvolcano-sedimentary low-grade metamorphic, located \nnorth of the city with the same name and located in the \ncentral portion of the Massif of Goi\u00e1s This sequence has \nbeen correlated to the Mara Rosa Sequence, the Group \nArax\u00e1 and also as an integral part of the upper unit \nof land greenstone belts. Recently, this sequence was \nindividualized as the unit being assigned to your Paleo-\nproterozoic metamorphic set of low-grade metamorphic, \npredominantly psammitic and pelitic metasedimentary \nrocks. Subordinate, this sequence also contains felsic \nmetavolcanic rocks and metaultramafic (Kuyumjian \net\u00a0al. 2004).\n\nIn the Serra da Mesa and Serra Dourada, north of \nGoi\u00e1s, based on stratigraphic evidence, lithological and \ntectonic, Marini et\u00a0 al. (1977) proposed the name of \nSerra da Mesa Group to package metamorphic granitic \nmassifs bordering the homonyms and mapped previously \nas Group Arax\u00e1. In the eastern area of work there is a \nset of predominantly metapsamitic rocks, metamorphic \nmapped initially as Group Arax\u00e1 and later redefined as \nSerra da Mesa Group, probably mid-Proterozoic age. \nIt is a set of quartz-mica schist, quartzite micaceous \nwith abundant quartz veins, in the case of a metased-\n\nimentary sequence with subordinate carbonate contri-\nbution, as seen through the lenses of marble near the \ncity of Campinorte. The contact with mylonitic granite \nis defined by extensive shear zones associated with \nthrust\u00a0faults.\n\nSpecifically in the region of Mara Rosa, supracrustal \nunits that constitute the volcano-sedimentary sequence \nare arranged in three main areas, structural directioned \nnortheast and dips northwest, called band East, Central \nand West, according to Arantes et\u00a0al. (1991). The eastern \nrange was divided into four major stratigraphic units, \nfrom bottom to top: Amaro Leite Unit, comprised me-\ntagraywackes interlayered with mafic metatuffs; Araras \nUnit, metatuffs mafic to intermediate with interbedded \nmetagraywackes, and felsic metavolcanic metacherts; \nPosse Unit, metatuffs felsic; and Carambolas Unit, \ncomposed of metatuffs sequence of mafic to felsic \nmetavolcanic intercalations. All these rock types have \nundergone metamorphism that reached the amphibolite \nfacies, which is the host of gold mineralization in the \ndeposit Posse, the Posse felsic unit.\n\nSmall granitic intrusions, of approximately 2-3 km \nfrom the major axis, occur in the Bois River Headwaters, \nalso intrusive in the volcano-sedimentary sequence of \nMara Rosa and designated here Mundinho granite, Vi-\nuva granite and St. George granite, characterized as Bois \nRiver Suite, which are the subject of detailing. The local \ngeology is represented in Figure 4, in which the main \ncontacts, geological and structural features are presented. \nThree main lithologic assemblages distributed along the \nheadboard of the Bois River designated metasedimentary \nsequence, volcanic-sedimentary sequence Mara Rosa and \ndeformed granites were defined. Granite Vi\u00fava (type \nVI) is represented by a granite body of approximately 3 \nkm2, quite hydrothermally altered and development of \npenetrative foliation marked by non-micaceous minerals. \nThe Mundinho granite (type MU) constitutes a body of \ngranite tectonite, an ellipsoid, flattened intrusive in a \nvolcano-sedimentary sequence and variations in tecton-\nic contact with quartzite and quartz muscovite schist. \nThe\u00a0features of mylonitization are quite pronounced in \nthese granitoids, as feldspar porphyroblasts stretch and \nquartz, related to shear zone with north-south directions \nand development of foliation associated with sulphide \nand auriferous veins.\n\nThe granitic rocks of Bois River present U-Pb ages \nranging from 2179 to 2158 Ma, and there is no Archean \ncontribution according Giustina (2007). The TDM Sm-\nNd model ages from supracrustal Campinorte Sequence \nand intrusive lithotypes of Bois River vary from 2682 \nto 2216\u00a0 Ma, with mostly positive ?Nd values, which \ndisclose the juvenile character of these rocks, in other \nwords, the juvenile character with short crustal resi-\ndence. The granodiorite yielded from zircon fractions \nrevealed variably discordant compositions indicating \nan upper intercept age of 2173\u00b110\u00a0Ma (MSWD=0.54), \ninterpreted as being representative of the igneous crys-\n\n\n\n48\n\nGeology and geochemistry of Bois River Suite, Mara Rosa (GO): evidence of magmatic arc paleoproterozoic\n\nGeochimica Brasiliensis 28(1): 43-64, 2014\n\ntallization age. Zircon grains from metatonalite with \nfive concordant zircon grains resulted in an upper \nintercept age of 2163\u00b11 Ma (MSWD=0.76) which is \nalso interpreted as the age of igneous crystallization. \nThe\u00a0 mylonitic tonalite five spot analyses yielded a \nconcordia age of 2158\u00b18\u00a0 Ma (MSWD=0.5), which is \ntaken as the best estimate for the crystallization age of \nthe igneous protolith.\n\nGeocronologic regional works dating U-Pb in zircon \nof metagranite associated with supracrustals provides a \nvalue of 2175\u00b112 Ma for igneous crystallization (Pimentel \net\u00a0al. 1997). Isotopic analyzes result in Sm-Nd model ages \n\n(TDM) into metagranitics rocks between 2.52 and 2.3\u00a0Ga \nand positive ?Nd (Kuyumjian et\u00a0 al. 2004), which thus \nindicates the juvenile character of short crustal residence \nfor sequence Campinorte and associated metagranitics. \nThe data presented by Giustina (2007) is similar to other \nPaleoproterozoic Provinces described in the Bras\u00edlia Belt, \nbut it contrasts with negative ?\n\nNd\n values in granitoids of \n\nwest border and Serrinha Blocks of San Francisco Craton, \nin the same age, which have features of material with \nlong residency and crustal contamination; hence, this \nstudy\u00a0 contributes to the reconstruction of the Columbia \nsupercontinent (Abdallah 2011).\n\nN\n\n4\n9\n\n\u00ba1\n6\n\n4\n9\n\n\u00ba1\n2\n\nW\n\n14\u00ba03S\n\nLATERITAS - LT\n\nMILONITOS - ML\n\nGRANITOS SUITE RIO \nDOS BOIAS - GR\n\nPA\nLE\n\nO\nP\n\nR\nO\n\nT\nE\n\nR\nO\n\nZ\n\nA\nrc\n\no\n m\n\nag\nm\n\n\u00e1t\nic\n\no\n p\n\nri\nm\n\nit\niv\n\no\nA\n\nrc\no\n\n m\nag\n\nm\n\u00e1t\n\nic\no\n\n d\ne \n\nM\nar\n\na \nR\n\no\nsa\n\nN\nE\n\nO\nP\n\nR\nO\n\nT\nE\n\nR\nO\n\nZ\n\u00d3\n\nIC\nO\n\nM\nE\n\nSO\nP\n\nR\nO\n\nT.\n\nFOLIA\u00c7\u00c3O\n\nFALHAMENTOS\n\nPer?s geol\u00f3gicos\n\nGarimpo\n\n0 0.5 1km\n\nEscala\n\nSEQ.

PETROGRAPHIC FEATURE OF SUITE OF BOIS RIVER\n\nIn this section we present the main petrographic types, \nthe most representative of the studied granites, and textural \nand mineralogical aspects of the rocks, which were summa-\nrized in the facies of hydrothermal processes preserved, and \nwhich has in biotite and muscovite granite paragenesis. Thus, \nit comes down to biotite muscovite peraluminous tonalite \nSJ, albitizated tonalite SJ, biotite muscovite granodiorite VI \n(biotite rebalanced), and muscovite biotite granodiorite MU \n(magmatic muscovite and biotite).\n\nThe tonalite SJ predominates muscovite and biotite \nwhich was possible to characterize three types petrographic \nwhose primary composition varies in function of intensity \nof hydrothermal alteration, as albitization, sericitization \n(potassic alteration), biotitization and propylitic (propylitic \nalteration), designated informally as Gc, Gb and Ga, with \nvariations in mineralogical composition in function the \nstage of the hydrothermal alteration and the amount of \nsecondary minerals.\n\nThe ?rst type, Gc, is a metatonalite (samples 111C and \n111C1), comprises macroscopically a rock with granolepi-\ndoblastic texture, coarse grained and foliation marked by \nbiotite lamellae orientation. Feldspars exhibit tabular habit \nand oval form and reach up to 1.5 cm in diameter and is \nsurrounded by biotite. Microscopically, it is composed of the \nfollowing mineral phases, quartz, albite, biotite, and zoizite, \ntitanite, chlorite, tourmaline and opaque include between \nmagnetite and pyrite (Figures 5A and 5B). The predominant \nfeldspar is albite (Ab 100%) and generally presents with an-\nhedric forms, with frequent mantle around the recrystallized \nquartz mineral and rarely presenting twinning according \nto the albite law preserved. As the main product change, \noccurs the formation of white mica and epidote. The masses \nof quartz is anhedral crystals with ondulation extinction \nand polygons contacts, biotite form plates throughout with \nbrown coloration (Figure 5B), which may be completely \nchlorized. In small amounts, it is observed pyrite usually \nwith a halo of alteration to limonite, and traces of magnetite, \nas products of hydrothermal alteration. The titanite may \nhave navicular habit, but in general it is anhedric shaped, \nbrownish color and frequently associated with aggregates \nof biotite and epidote.\n\nAnother type petrographic, Gb (samples 111B and \n111B1), it is metatonalite, probably a more altered facies \nobserved in this area. It corresponds to a rock of light \ngray, medium grained presenting an incipient banding. The \nmineralogy is mainly represented by more altered feldspar, \nmainly albite, and quartz and actinolite. This rock has \ndisseminations of sulphides as pyrite and chalcopyrite, and \npyrite displays euhedric shapes and coloformic.\n\nThe sample Ga is biotite muscovite metatonalite (samples \n111A2 and A3) that have under microscopy presents inequi-\ngranular texture, medium to coarse grained and grayish white. \nIt\u00a0develops discrete foliation marked by micaceous minerals, \nmainly biotite. Sample is less deformed among the other \nrock types granite. The mineralogy consists of plagioclase \n(albite), K-feldspar, biotite, white mica, epidote, quartz and \nmagnetite (dashes). Petrographically characterized by higher \namounts of white mica, generated by intense sericitization \nwhich was submitted and the modal proportion of biotite \nsubordinate. The\u00a0latter are presented as isolated plates with \npleochroism brown tint and represent remains of magmatic \nbiotite. The\u00a0feldspars have become quite sericitized.\n\nIn the body biotite muscovite granodiorite VI were char-\nacterized petrographic types that host gold mineralization \nand variations are hydrothermally-altered granodiorite, with \ndeformation features developed, as can be seen in Figures\u00a06A \nto 6D. Basically, this body hydrothermally granodiorite VI \nhosts auriferous veins showing variations in the relative \nintensity of hydrothermal alteration.\n\nThe sample VIA, muscovite biotite granodiorite cat-\naclastic, corresponds to grayish rock, coarse to medium \ngrained texture and granolepdoblastic foliation marked by \nthe preferred orientation of micaceous minerals. The\u00a0miner-\nalogy essentially comprises albite, K feldspar, biotite, white \nmica, epidote, and in proportions subordinated, there is \nilmenite and pyrite, and tourmaline, zircon and titanite as \naccessories. The plagioclase is mainly albite (Ab 100%), \nshowing xenomor?c habit with oval form, often showing \nalbite twinning law. The fenoclasts feature heavily stretched \nand rotated (Figure 6D) usually surrounded by a mantle of \nchange consists of white mica, quartz and epidote or only \nwith halo of recrystallized quartz. The quartz grains present \n\nFigures 5\n\nPetrographic aspects of biotite musco-\nvite metatonalite SJ (Gc): in (A)\u00a0textural \n\nrelationship between crystals of albite, \nquartz and secondary biotite, and in \n(B)\u00a0detail of plates secondary hydro-\n\nthermal biotite and epidote aggregates; \nacronym Kretz (1983) minerals, biotite \n\n(Bt), muscovite (Ms), quartz (Qtz), \nplagioclase (Pl).\n\nA B\n\n\n\n50\n\nGeology and geochemistry of Bois River Suite, Mara Rosa (GO): evidence of magmatic arc paleoproterozoic\n\nGeochimica Brasiliensis 28(1): 43-64, 2014\n\nin this lithotype are xenomor?cs habit, heterogeneity in size \nand exhibit wavy extinction, with contacts polygon. The bi-\notite shows up as plates or lamellae well developed, primary \ntype rebalanced (Figure 6B), with brown pleochroism, and \noccurs associated with hydrothermal white mica and epidote \naggregates; often these minerals form shear bands marked \nby irregular and narrow bands, where they alternate with \nbands mainly composed of recrystallized quartz.\n\nIn type VI4A1 it constitutes variation from the previous \nsample, and also checked deformation and hydrotermal ef-\nfects, with higher modal proportion of biotite and titanite. \nAplitic dikes are observed in sectioning this lithofacies \nwhere lodges by gold-bearing quartz vein, always with \nsubstantial amount of chlorite.

MINERAL CHEMISTRY\n\nThis topic studies, through mineral chemistry, the \nmajor phases of phyllosilicates observed in granitic rocks, \nmainly biotite and muscovite. The chemical analyzes \nwere made using electronic microprobe, Cameca SX-\n50\u00ae model, in the Laboratory of Electron microprobe of \nthe University of Bras\u00edlia. Preliminarily, we performed \na study and a petrographic analysis of the optical prop-\n\nerties of minerals and separation fields preferred for \nchemical analysis.\n\nMost of these minerals have signi?cant compositional vari-\nations, i.e. rebalancing physicochemical related to hydrothermal \nprocesses that have acted on the granitic rocks. Especially phases \nmicaceous white mica and biotite, as well as albite and chlorite, which \nare relatively abundant in hydrothermal granites VI MU and SJ types.\n\n5.1. Biotite\n\nThe study of the chemical composition of biotite formed \nauxiliary tool in the de?nition and characterization of the \ngranitic rocks in the region of research. The ferromagnesian \nmineral primary, often in the composition of granitic rocks, \nso with distinction, re?ects the nature and physicochemical \nconditions of this magma. Metasomatic-hydrothermal con-\nditions in the presence of biotite can be characterized a zone \nof enrichment potassium granite or potassium alteration.\n\nThe micaceous mineral is biotite with trioctahedral \nstructure, with the general formula X\n\n2\nY\n\n6\nZ\n\n8\n(OH)\n\n4\n in which \n\nX=K, Na, Ca; Y=Fe+2, Mg, Mn, Li, Fe+3, Al, Ti+4; Z=Si+4, Al. \nBasically we analyzed the major elements in the form of \noxides. How stands the chemical composition of magmatic \nbiotite are diagnostic of the types of magmas generated \nfrom different sources and different petrogenetic histories, \naccording to Nachit (1986) and Abdel-Rahman (1994).\n\nThe biotite from two mica granites studied usually oc-\ncurs in the form of lamellae and has preserved when brown \ncoloration brownish, and are common in transformation \nto chlorite (chloritic). In the diagram proposed by Nachit \n(1986) for different types of biotite granitic rocks (Figure\u00a08), \nwhere the vertices are 10TiO\n\n2\n, FeO+MnO and MgO, we \n\nde?ne the primary ?elds of brown biotite, biotite domain \n\nof primary rebalanced green-brown and ?nally the ?eld of \nsecondary biotite of green.\n\nThe three types of biotite granites can be identi?ed \nin the study: biotite I, primary found in biotite muscovite \nmetagranodiorite MU, variety richer in TiO\n\n2\n; biotite type II \n\nprimary rebalanced in an intermediate position, identi?ed in \nSJ metatonalite biotite muscovite, biotite muscovite granodi-\norite VI and biotite granodiorite VI. Biotite is nearer to the \nsecondary type III, in a more advanced stage of hydrothermal \ntransformation identi?ed in biotite muscovite SJ and biotite \nmuscovite MU hydrothermalized, and only the primary bi-\notite can be used for the granites tipology. The recognition \nof these different biotite phases constitutes essential point \nin the development of this study.\n\nThe replacement of Ti in octahedral sites has been stud-\nied in biotite metamorphic having consensus in the literature \nthat the content of Ti in biotite increases with metamorphic \ngrade, i.e. with increasing of temperature. The decrease in Ti \nstudied biotite is related to hydrothermal processes that acted \non granitic rocks area, so that titanium was extracted from \nthe structure of biotite rich in titanium by these hydrothermal \nsolutions and crystallization as a new mineral phase rich in \ntitanium as titanite and/or rutile and/or ilmenite.\n\nA B\n\n\n\n52\n\nGeology and geochemistry of Bois River Suite, Mara Rosa (GO): evidence of magmatic arc paleoproterozoic\n\nGeochimica Brasiliensis 28(1): 43-64, 2014\n\nIn the diagram of classi?cation of biotite from Deer \net\u00a0 al. (1992 \u2013 Figure 9), where the poles are positioned \ntrioctaedrics non-litiniferas micas, it can be distinguished \n?elds of biotites and phlogopites, and the iron rich series an-\nnite-siderophyllite and magnesian series phlogopite-estonite. \n\nFrom the Figure 9 it is characterized that three types of \nbiotite was designated types I, II, III, related to the phases \nof development of this granitic magmatism. The biotite \ntype I observed in samples 53C and 111A2 represents the \nprimary biotite in granodiorite MU and tonalite SJ, whose \nanalyzes are concentrated in the ?eld iron richest biotite \nof annite-siderophyllite series. The biotite type II, primary \nrebalanced, observed in muscovite biotite granodiorite VI, is \nlocated in the ?eld of biotite Fe richer, but concentrated on \nthe intermediate portions between annite and phlogopite, \nand have brown coloring and lamellar habit.\n\nThe biotite type III, near to the secondary field, \nbelongs to the phlogopite-estonite series forming trioc-\ntaedrics micas more enriched in MgO. It is often asso-\nciated with ?lms biotites foliated (granodiorite MU) or \nas disseminated plates in metatonalite SJ, samples 111C. \nIt\u00a0presents brownish coloring tending to greenish to color-\nless pleochroism and found often chlorited associated with \nsul?des mainly pyrite and chalcopyrite. These variations in \nthe composition of biotite can be seen in the graph TiO\n\n2\n x \n\nMgO (Figure 10), in which the type III biotite is typically \ndepleted in TiO\n\n2\n and typically more magnesian biotite in \n\nrelation to types I and II.\n\nThe study of the chemistry of primary biotite granitic \nrocks have been used for classi?cation into different types of \nassociations or magma magmatic series according to Nachit \n(1986). The positioning of the biotite in diagram Mg vs. Al \n(afu is atom per formula unit) proposed (Figure 11), in which \ncan be distinguished different groups of magmatic biotite, \nbased on the relationship between cationic Mg and Al, is \nboth in the ?eld of alumino-potassic high MgO granitic series \n(biotite II, primary rebalanced), as the ?eld of calc-alkaline \nseries (biotite I, primary). Note that the biotite rebalanced \nshould be interpreted with caution in this diagram, consider-\ning that the biotite II clearly had an enrichment of aluminum, \nmoving into the alumino-potassic domain.\n\nAbdel-Rahman (1994), using a database containing \n325 analyzes biotite granite of the various locations, showed \nthat the composition of biotite depends on the nature of the \nmagma from which crystallized, and on the types of granitic \nsuites including alkaline anarogenic suite type A, calcium \nalkaline orogenic suite type C and peraluminous suite type P. \n\nIn the ternary diagram MgO x FeO x Al\n2\nO\n\n3\n (Figure\u00a012), \n\nit appears that the investigated biotite granites ?eld con-\ncentrates on the calcium alkaline series (type C), in the case \nof primary biotite I of granodiorite MU and granodiorite \nVI, it was also con?rmed in the diagram of Nachit (1986) \nthe calcium alkaline character. Others biotite tend to ?eld \nperaluminous series as samples of tonalite SJ, showing that \nthere was a rebalancing effectively with enrichment in alu-\nminum, positioning them in the ?eld peraluminous domain. \n\nFigure 8\n\nGraphic ternary (Nachit 1986), which \nvisualizes the three types of biotite \ngranites found in the Bois River \nSuite.

Muscovite \n\nThe muscovite mica represents important mineral phase \nin the paragenesis of granitic rocks and also geological sig-\nni?cance in the context of the mineralized areas, designated \ngenerally as white mica. The investigations led to distin-\nguishing different types of white mica, textural differences \nbeing observed as well-developed lamellae or also in the \nform of aggregates of ?ne lamellae. Regardless of habit, the \npleochroism can vary from colorless to slightly pale. \n\nBased on the ternary diagram represented by poles, \nAl, M+2 (Fe+Mn+Mg) and Si (Figure 13), which de?nes the \nextremes of mica white as a solid solution consisting by \nmuscovite and celadonite according to the classi?cation of \nRieder et\u00a0 al. (1998). Micas analyzed are located near the \npole of phengite and can be classi?ed as muscovite-phengite, \nboth the primary and the secondary.\n\nThe incorporation of Ti in the structure of dioctaed-\nrics micas has been widely used to study the evolution of \ngranites. An important conclusion from this study refers to \nincreasing the titanium solubility with increasing of the grade \nmetamorphic, i.e. of the temperature (Monier and Robert \n1986). Muscovites in the two-mica granites, Ti has been \nused to distinguish magmatic muscovites of the muscovites \npost-magmatic or late, the ?rst typically more enriched in \ntitanium, due to the greater availability of Ti in the early stag-\n\nes of crystallization. Such that the more enriched micas may \noccur either in metamorphic rocks such as in granitic rocks.\n\nBased on Figure 14 Al\n2\nO\n\n3\n x TiO\n\n2\n boundary between \n\nprimary and secondary muscovite corresponds to around \nof 0.6% TiO\n\n2\n, from which we can characterize three types \n\nof muscovites designated I, II and III, type II intermediate \nbetween I and III.\n\nThe muscovite type I corresponds to the typical pri-\nmary magmatic phase, occurring mainly granodiorite MU, \nappearing as aggregates of plates in paragenesis with mag-\nmatic biotite. The muscovite type II, intermediate between \nthe two types of TiO\n\n2\n, has values between 0.4 and 0.6%, \n\noccurs predominantly granodiorite VI in the form of lamellar, \naggregates oriented phengite and represents an intermediate \nstage in the evolution of hydrothermal sometimes in para-\ngenesis primary biotite rebalanced.\n\nThe type III represents fengites aluminous compared \nto other, occurs in the form of thin lamellar masses and \ncharacterized by lower values of TiO2, forming white mica \nhydrothermal example, both the tonalite SJ (in paragenesis \nwith magnesian biotite), as well as granodiorite VI. Indis-\ntinctly, muscovite varieties have signi?cant values between \n0.3 and 0.6% BaO, not ?nding correspondence with other \ntypes of muscovite in the literature.\n\nbio granodiorito grosso VI \n\nbio musc hidrotermalitoMU\n\nbiot musc metatonalito SJ\nbiot musc metagranodiorito MU\n\ngranito hidrotermal SJ\n\nAl\n\nMuscovita\n\nAnnita\n\nFe+Mn+Mg Si\n\nCeladonita\n\nFengita\n\nbio musc granodiorito VI \n\nFigure 13\n\nClassi?cation of white mica, according \nto Rieder et\u00a0al.

LITHOGEOCHEMISTRY\n\nThe lithogeochemistry study aimed to characterize \nthe chemistry of the granitic Bois River Suite, host of gold \nmineralization, through the analysis of major elements, trace \nelements and rare earth elements. Note that the selection \nof granite types for analysis was to test the petrography, \nwhich were less altered and hydrothermalized. The chemical \nanalyzes were performed at the Laboratory Bondar-Clegg, \nCanada, the major elements by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) \nand trace elements analyzed by neutron activation (INAA).\n\nThe chemical composition of the rocks will be used in \norder to establish criteria to diagnose the type of original \ngranite, since in petrography, the studied rocks were subjected \nto hydrothermal and metasomatic processes from highest to \nlowest intensity. However, the performance of metasomatic \nprocesses implies that the geochemical characteristics of these \ndocuments have changed, especially in relation to mobile \nelements. Given these observations, the geochemical compo-\nsitions will be used in a qualitative manner, especially in an \nattempt to identify the composition of granites and tectonic \nenvironment. The samples selected for analysis in general do \nnot present the effects of weathering and represent granitic \ntypes most characteristic of each lithofacies. The results of \nchemical analyzes performed are presented in tables, which \nwe used for the preparation of diagrams petrochemicals.\n\nThe rocks studied were classi?ed using the diagram \nDebon and Lefort (1983), which uses the parameters P and \nQ (Figure 15), to indicate the tonalitic granodioritic composi-\ntion. In granodiorites VI and MU predominates granodioritic \nin composition and only tonalitic in type SJ. Three samples \n\nwere positioned outside of the petrographic ?elds, being \nthose most hydrothermalized. This diagram was preferred \nnaming regarding classic petrographic classi?cation due to \nmineralogical transformations suffered by these granites. \n\nFor geochemical study of the granites were used varia-\ntion diagrams of major oxides and trace elements, in order to \ndescribe the behavior and evolution of these granites. In the \ndiagram MgO x TiO\n\n2\n (Figure 16), there is similarity between \n\nthe ratio MgO/TiO\n2\n\n of the samples despite hydrothermal al-\nteration developed, i.e., these elements were not signi?cantly \nmodi?ed in relation to magmatic concentrations. The rocks \nanalyzed show an evolution of the less evolved granitic to \nterms with little MgO and TiO\n\n2\n in chemical composition.\n\nIn binary type Harker diagrams showing variations of \nthe different oxides in relation to the silica for the granites \nof Bois River Suite, the content of SiO2 ranges from 57 to \n81%, the one of Al\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n, from 10 to 16%, the one of K\n\n2\nO, \n\nfrom 0.2 to 3.0%, the one of Na\n2\nO, from 2.2 to 4.7%, the \n\none of CaO, between 0.3 to 3%, the ratio of K\n2\nO/Na\n\n2\nO is \n\nlower than 1, and the ration of MgO/TiO\n2\n ranges from 2 to \n\n7%. Additionally, it is shown a negative correlation between \nsilica and CaO, TiO\n\n2\n, MgO, P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n, with a trend of increasing \n\nNa\n2\nO with silica, while the relationship with K\n\n2\nO shows a \n\nmore random distribution. Thus, in terms of which is richer \nin silica, there has been a decrease of Ti, Mg, Ca and P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n.\n\nRegarding the alumina saturation index, ISA=Al\n2\nO\n\n3\n/\n\nCaO+Na\n2\nO+K\n\n2\nO molar or A/CNK vs. A/NK or alumina \n\nindex according Maniar and Piccoli (1989 \u2013 Figure 17), the \nrocks analyzed show predominant feature peraluminous. \n\nFigure 14\n\nDiagram TiO\n2\n x Al\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n of muscovites \n\n(fengite) granites studied, the boundary \nbetween the two main types I and II, is \nclose to 0.6% TiO\n\n2\n.\n\n\n\n57\n\nAbdallah S.\n\nGeochimica Brasiliensis 28(1): 43-64, 2014\n\nbio musc granodiorito MU\n\ngranodiorito alterado VI\n\nmilonito SJ\n\nto adgd\n\ndq mzdq mzq\n\nmzmzgogo\n\nP=K-(Na+Ca)\n\nDebon &amp; Le Fort P-Q 1983\n\n-400\n\nQ\n=S\n\ni/\n3-\n\n(K\n+N\n\na+\n2C\n\na/\n3)\n\n-300 -200 -100 0 100\n\nsq\n\ns\n\ngr\n\nmetatonalito alterado SJ\nhidrotermalito MU\n\nbiotita musc metatonalito SJ\n\nbio musc granodiorito VI \nbiotita metatonalito SJ\n\n0\n50\n\n10\n0\n\n15\n0\n\n20\n0\n\n25\n0\n\nFigure 15\n\nClassi?cation of granites of the study \narea, according to the diagram of Debon \n\nand Lefort (1983) for plutonic rocks, \nleading to main ?elds: to\u00a0(tonalite), \ngd\u00a0(granodiorite), ad (adamelito), \n\ngr\u00a0(granite), dq\u00a0(quartz diorite), \nmzdq\u00a0(quartz monzodiorite), mzq\u00a0(quartz \n\nmonzonite), sq\u00a0(quartz syenite).\n\nbio musc granodiorito MU\n\ngranodiorito alterado VI\n\nmilonito SJ\n\n0\n\n0.\n0\n\n0.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n0.\n8\n\n1.\n0\n\n1.\n2\n\n1.\n4\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nMgO\n\nT\niO\n\n2\n\nmetatonalito alterado SJ\nhidrotermalito MU\n\nbiotita musc metatonalito SJ\n\nbio musc granodiorito VI \nbiotita metatonalito SJ\n\nFigure 16\n\nGraphical MgO x TiO\n2\n for the granitic \n\nBois River Suite, where the samples \nshow a tendency for a positive correla-\n\ntion between these major elements.\n\n\n\n58\n\nGeology and geochemistry of Bois River Suite, Mara Rosa (GO): evidence of magmatic arc paleoproterozoic\n\nGeochimica Brasiliensis 28(1): 43-64, 2014\n\n6.1. Tectonic setting\n\nAiming to investigate the genesis of the granitic Rio dos \nBois Suite and the environment of formation of these granitic \nrocks, drew up discriminant diagrams of lithogeochemistry. \nIn\u00a0 the multicationic graphical R1- R2, Bachelor Bowden \n(1985) the granodiorite VI samples show characteristics of \nperaluminous magmatism system syn-collisional to post-colli-\nsional, and SJ tonalite with geochemical signature of post-col-\nlisional granites (Figure 18). This interpretation agrees with \nthe analysis using the graphics Pearce et\u00a0al. (1984), where they \npresent post to syn-collisional characteristics.\n\nApplying content (Nb/Zr)N vs. Zr normalized to prim-\nitive mantle of Sun and McDonough (1989) and according \nwith Thi\u00e9blemont and T\u00e9gyey (1994), (Figure 19), the Rio \ndos Bois Suite, falls largely in the ?eld of calc-alkaline mag-\nmatism to crustal contamination (?eld B) or A2/colisional \n\ngranitoid type with crustal sources, whose ratio Y/Nb is \nabove 1.2. Granitic type A1 ratio Y/Nb is less than 1.2 and \nis characterized by continental intraplate environment or \nRift (?eld C). Within a system of convergent plate margin, \nthis granitogenese corresponds to the later phases of the \nArc collisional system. Thus, some samples plots in ?eld \non the edge of the calc-alkaline magmatism derived from \nsubduction zone, considering that they evolved from the \ncontinental margin Arc of the primitive type of Paleop-\nroterozoic age.\n\nIn Figure 20 the best preserved specimens are in the \n?eld of syn-collisional to post-collisional granitic, where it \nis emphasized that types of samples over hydrothermalized \nare in the ?eld intraplate granites due to Y enrichement in \nduring the hydrothermal process.\n\nOnly in samples Gb and Gc of tonalite SJ, the composition is \nmetaluminous. The difference with this character geochemi-\ncal metaluminous in SJ types, since their biotite compositions \nare indicating peraluminous, should chemical changes and \nrebalancing suffered by biotite, re?ecting metasomatic-hy-\ndrothermal process in the rock, with enrichment of alumina \nduring this process.\n\nPapers in granites of Australia developed by Blevin and \nChappell (1995) relate ISA values<1.1 to I-type granites and \n\nISA>1.1 to S-type granite. The tonalitic rocks Gb and Gc \nof the SJ tonalite show ISA values&lt;1, while the other rocks \nvalues are equal or close to 1.1.

CONCLUSIONS\n\n8. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nIn the area Bois River were characterized granitic bod-\nies, mainly granodiorite VI, MU and tonalite SJ; intrusions \nare small- to medium-sized, well-deformed and intrusive in \nsequence Campinorte, and occur as NNE-trending elongate \nplutons showing varied degrees of deformation. The main \ngranite bodies are represented by Mundinho and Vi\u00fava \nintrusions, which host gold deposits related to Au Porphiry \nin paleoproterozoic transcorrent shear zone. \n\nThe classi?cation of these rocks indicates granodioritic to \ntonalitic composition. The Bois River Suite exhibit character-\nistics of magmatism, predominantly peraluminous, that are in \nthe ?eld syn-collisional to post-collisional granitic. The sam-\nples of more hydrothermalized type are located in the ?eld of \ngranite intraplaque due to enriched in Y, Yb and Ta. The MgO/\nTiO\n\n2\n ratios in granites are similar, despite the hydrothermal \n\nalteration developed, i.e., these elements have not been signi?-\ncantly modi?ed from the magmatic concentrations. The rocks \nanalyzed show an evolution from the less evolved granites \nto terms with little MgO and TiO\n\n2\n in chemical composition.\n\nStudies of mineral chemistry in biotite and muscovite \nshowed that these minerals have signi?cant compositional \nvariations, i.e., rebalancing physic-chemical related to hy-\ndrothermal processes that have acted on the granitic rocks. \nThree types of biotite designated type I, II, III has been \ncharacterized, related to different phases of development of \nthese granites: biotite I, primary, is richer in variety TiO\n\n2\n, \n\nbiotite type II is primary biotite rebalanced, and type III \n(magnesian), secondary impoverished in TiO\n\n2\n.\n\nIn the ternary diagram MgO x Al\n2\nO\n\n3\n x FeO the biotite \n\nof this Suite focuses both on the ?eld of calc-alkaline series, \ntype C (biotite granodiorite MU), as the peraluminous series \nin tonalite SJ. The white micas analyzed are located near the \npole muscovite fhengite, and may qualify them as phengite, \nboth the primary and the secondary. It has been possible to \ncharacterize three types of white mica, muscovite I, II and\u00a0III. \nThe muscovite I is primary magmatic muscovite and II, III \ntype are secondary and intermediate a more aluminous and \ncharacterized by lower values of TiO\n\n2\n.\n\nSpecial thanks to professor PhD.
