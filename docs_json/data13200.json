The use of acidic \nconditioners, such as Pinus needles mixed with alkaline substrates, allows the cultivation of \nseedlings with better quality. The objective of this work was to evaluate the development of \nthe \u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d rootstock grown in different alkaline commercial substrate mixtures \n(Humosolo ES\u00ae) with Pinus elliottii needles. The experiment was carried out by testing alkaline \nsubstrate mixed with 5-month old of decomposition Pinus needles in situ decomposition and two \ngranulometry sizes, 3.5 and 8.0 mm. The mixtures were performed in proportions between the \nneedles with the Humosolo, (v / v) 0%; 25%; 50%; 75% and 100%. Expanded cellular polystyrene \ntrays were used to accommodate the mixtures and seeding of the rootstock. Physical and chemical \nevaluateons of the mixtures were carried out, as well as the development of the seedlings. The \nuse of Pinus needles acidified the substrate Humosolo ES\u00ae, reduced its electrical conductivity \nand increased the percentage of porous space of the mixtures and reduced water retention. The \ntreatments containing 25 and 50% of the Pinus needles mixture, regardless of the granulometry, \nprovide greater development of rootstock plants \u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d.\nIndex terms: physical-chemical characteristics of substrates, protected environment. seedlings, pH.\n\nPotencial da ac\u00edcula de Pinus elliottii Engelm. como condicionador \nde substrato para produ\u00e7\u00e3o do porta-enxerto de citros \n\n\u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d\nResumo- A produ\u00e7\u00e3o de mudas de citros em ambiente protegido demanda grande quantidade \nde substrato, o qual deve apresentar caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas e qu\u00edmicas adequadas.

In relation to the fruit industry, \ncitrus is considered one of the most important segments, \nnot only for human nutrition, but also for the economic \nvalues obtained with this product, supplying the domestic \nand international market. However, there are numerous \nbottlenecks in the production chain, especially in the \nproduction of seedlings.\n\nThe most used citrus rootstocks in Rio Grande do \nSul are \u201cTrifoliata\u201d (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.) and \ntheir hybrids, due to their tolerance to lower temperatures. \nOne of these hybrids, \u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d, has desirable \ncharacteristics such as induction of canopy tolerance to low \nwinter temperatures; reduction of plant size; promotion of \nthe production of quality fruits; in addition to presenting \na faster development in the nursery in comparison to P. \ntrifoliata (OLIVEIRA et al., 2010; KOLLER, 2013). \nHence, the average time for the production of citrus \nseedlings in Rio Grande do Sul using the open-air system \nis, on average, three years (KOLLER, 1994), compared to \nhot climate regions. On the other hand, the production of \nseedlings in the protected environment allows producing \na seedling in up to 22 months, which demands a great \namount of substrate since the production is carried out in \ncontainers (AZEVEDO et al., 2009).\n\nSubstrate is any material of mineral and/or \norganic origin, pure or in a mixture, capable of providing \nanchoring and supplying the water and oxygen needs of \nplants (VENCE, 2008). This input of great importance \nin the cultivation in containers can be altered by using \ndifferent materials, particle size, humidity, therefore, \nproviding themselves with new material with unique \ncharacteristics.\n\nMost of the substrates are produced using composted \nPinus bark (YAMAGUTI, 2009). In Rio Grande do Sul, \nbecause the adequate and available-for-citrus substrates \nare scarce, there is a need to import products, which result \nin high costs, mainly for freight. According to Sch\u00e4fer et \nal. (2015), most of the substrates evaluated in the southern \nregion show negative aspects such as alkaline pH and high \nelectrical conductivity (salinity). Therefore, materials that \nare chemically and physically stable and inexpensive are \nmore and more desired. \n\nThe cultivation of Pinus sp. involves large \nextensions of land in southern Brazil, representing \n26.5% of national reforestation, occupying an area of \napproximately 1.8 million hectares (GIONGO et al., \n2011). This crop stands out as a raw material in several \nindustrial activities, which are an essential base for the \neconomy. However, it generates countless residues in \nits production such as Pinus needles. Piovesan et al. \n(2012) observed an annual accumulation of 7.1 Mg ha-1 \nof litter in an 8-year-old Pinus crop, which was formed \n\nby 95.6% of the needles. This material, which has not \nyet been explored, has already been reported as having \nlow pH (VERDONCK et al., 1981; GOMES et al., 1991; \nRISTOW et al., 2009), and may be an alternative material \nto minimize pH alkalinity of certain substrates.\n\nDue to the characteristics of the mentioned \nmaterial and to the great importance of the substrate in \nthe cultivation of plants in containers, the objective of this \nwork was to evaluate the production of a citrus rootstock \n(\u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d) grown in different proportions of \nan alkaline commercial substrate, due to the characteristics \nof the previously mentioned materials and the great \nimportance of the substrate (Hum solo ES\u00ae) and crushed \nPinus elliottii needles on the germination phase.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThe experiment was conducted in a protected \nenvironment, covered with polyethylene and with anti-\naphid screen walls, with no temperature control and \nrelative humidity, at the Faculdade de Agronomia of the \nFederal University of Rio Grande do Sul, located in Porto \nAlegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul (30\u00ba04\u2019S, 51\u00ba08\u2019W; 38 \nm above sea level). This experiment consisted of different \nmixtures (v/v) of a commercial substrate using Pinus \nelliottii needles at 5-month old in situ decomposition, \nat the senescence stage, but still adhered to the plants, \nwithout contact with the soil. Under these conditions, \nsamples of adult trees from the same stand were collected. \nSuch trees had been fallen down five months ago at the \nAgronomic Experiment Station of the Federal University \nof Rio Grande do Sul (EEA / UFRGS; 30\u00ba29\u2019S and \n51\u00ba06\u2019W; 46 m above sea level). \n\nThe needles were dried in a sheltered place over a \nbench with an average temperature of 25 \u00baC for 15 days. \nAfterward, they were crushed in two different particle \nsizes (3.5 mm and 8.0 mm) in a sieve mill and mixed at \nfive percentages (0; 25; 50; 75 and 100%) to the substrate \n(Humosolo ES\u00ae) from VIDA Company. This input made \non the basis of eucalyptus bark has optimum physical \ncharacteristics for use in containers, but its pH is slightly \nalkaline (pH 7.2 \u00b1 0.5). \n\nThe mixtures were placed in 121.2 cm\u00b3 expanded \npolystyrene trays of inverted pyramidal shape (120 x \n50 mm - depth x cell width). Sowing of the rootstock \n\u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. x \nCitrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck.], from matrices located in \nthe EEA/UFRGS, was carried out in October 2014. The \nseeds were submitted to thermal treatment (immersion in \nwater at 52\u00baC for 10 minutes), after which a seed per cell \nwas placed at 0.5 cm depth. Irrigation management was \nautomated and consisted of three daily micro-sprinkler \ncycles, totaling an average of 3 mm day-1. No additional \nfertilizations were carried out on the substrates over the \n\n\n\n3Potential of Pinus elliottii Engelm. needles as substrate conditioner for the production of \u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d ...\n\nRev.

(2000) \nover the cultivation cycle. After 49 days of sowing, the \nvariables emergence percentage and seedling formation, \naverage emergence time and emergence speed index were \nevaluated, which was determined based on the sum of the \nnumber of emerged seedlings, divided by the respective \ntime, and then dividing the final result by the total number \nof seedlings emerged in each replicate. In addition, at \nthe end of the experiment, 166 days after sowing, the \nvariables height, diameter, dry mass of the aerial part, dry \nmass of the roots, leaf count and leaf area were measured. \nHowever, height was measured with the aid of a measuring \ntape, from the surface of the substrate to the apical point \nof the seedling; the diameter was measured using a digital \ncaliper at one centimeter from the base, and the leaf area \nwas obtained on a Li-Cor Li-3100 leaf area meter.\n\nThe different substrate formulations were submitted \nto chemical and physical analysis at the Substrates \nLaboratory of the Department of Horticulture and Forestry \n(DHS) at the Faculty of Agronomy (UFRGS), in Porto \nAlegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThe experimental design used in the study was a \nrandomized block design with split-plots. The main plot \nconsisted of the proportions of Pinus elliottii needles \nin the composition of the substrates (0; 25; 50; 75 and \n100%), and the subplots were the particle size (3.5 and \n8.0 mm). Each treatment consisted of four replicates of \n12 cells each. Data were submitted to analysis of variance \n(ANOVA) by the Costat 6.4 software, and polynomial \nregression by SigmaPlot 11.0 at the level of 1% (**) and \n5% (*) of a probability of error, in order to verify the effect \nof the percentage of leaf on the substrate composition. \nThe electrical conductivity data did not meet the ANOVA \nassumptions and because of that, they were therefore \ntransformed into log x/10.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nStatistical analysis of the data showed no interaction \nbetween particle size and Pinus needles proportion for the \nvariables tested in the study. However, the different ratios \nof the needles used in the composition of the substrates \ninfluenced the growth and development of the \u201cFepagro \nC37 Reck\u201d rootstock (Table 1). \n\nThe Pinus needles showed acidic pH, regardless \nof granulometry, while the pure commercial substrate \n(0% leaf treatment), alkaline pH. As the percentage of \nthe needles increased, the pH reduced proportionally, \nreaching intermediate values to the pure materials. \nHowever, this pH change was most evident when the \npercentage of the needles was higher than 75% at the \n\nbeginning of the cultivation (Figure 1A and B). In addition, \ngreater acidification of the substrate was found 40 days \nafter sowing in the treatments that presented the highest \nproportions of needles in the mixture.\n\nAlthough the amplitude between the substrates \nwas greater in the first evaluation, the pH values of the \nmaterials tended to be nearer over time probably due to the \nlow potential acidity of the Pinus needles and to the low \nbuffering effect of the substrate. The large pH variation \noccurred mainly in the 100% needles treatment (Figure \n1A and B), excluding the possibility of the commercial \nsubstrate buffer effect. Several factors may cause changes \nin the pH of the medium, such as the decomposition of \nthe source material, the release of exudates by the roots \nof the plants, the alkalinity of the irrigation water and the \nfertilization (FOCHESATO et al., 2008; SCH\u00c4FER et \nal., 2008). The variation in the pH verified in this study \nis likely to be caused by the alkalinity of irrigation water.\n\nThe need to leach 20% of the watering so to \nfacilitate gas exchange within the cultivation container \ncould have favored the mentioned effect. This is because \nthe application of a volume of water over irrigation to \nreach the pot capacity or a volume exceeding that capacity \nby 20% may have altered the pH of the medium, as well \nas through leaching, the amount of salts over cultivation \ncould have decreased (Figure 1C and D), since the average \nvalue of pH and EC of the irrigation water during the \nconduction period of the experiment was 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 and \n110.0 \u00b1 1.0 ?S cm-1, respectively. Therefore, Pinus needles \nprovide relative acidity, capable of acidifying the medium \nif used at a large proportion. However, the maintenance \nof an adequate pH value can be adjusted with acidic \nreaction fertilization or pH adjustment of the irrigation \nwater, thus maintaining the ideal pH for the cultivation \nof potted plants.\n\nIn relation to the electrical conductivity (EC), the \nresults showed that the reduction of the granulometry \nresulted in higher release of ions to the solution and, \nconsequently, the increase in the electrical conductivity. \nThis fact was verified by the difference between the \ntreatments of 100% needles at the 3.5 mm granulometry \nshowing 600 ?S cm-1 and in the 8.0 mm granulometry at \n231.5 ?S cm -1, both on the sowing day (Figure 1C and D).\n\nThe value of EC presented by the substrate \nHumosolo ES\u00ae manufacturer is higher than that of the \nPinus needles, with an average value of 2100 \u00b1 500 ?S \ncm-1, which was verified in the treatment of 0% needles \nand zero time (Figure 1C and D). It has also been found \nthat as the ratio of the leaf increases, EC decreased in \nthe formulated substrate. In spite of the granulometry \nand percentage of the needles, the substrates showed low \nlevels - for the treatment without addition of the needles \n(treatment 0%) - to very low - for the treatments with \na large percentage of needles at the beginning of the \nexperiment, according to classification established by \n\n\n\n4 H. Ceccagno et al.\n\nRev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 3:  (e-039)                                                                      \n\nCavins et al. (2000). \nThe high EC reduction over the crop is caused by \n\nthe leaching of the soluble salts through the irrigation \nsystem. Thus, none of the treatments exceeded the EC \nindex considered normal for substrates (2600 to 4600 ?S \ncm-1) (CAVINS et al., 2000). This feature is positive since \nplant nutrition can be managed by precisely meeting the \ncrop requirement. Fagundes et al. (2015), when evaluating \nthe development of yellow passion fruit seedlings report \nthat the loss of nutrients by leaching is a serious issue in \nthe seedling production system, since it represents a loss \nof capital in the form of nutrients and water, as well as \nextending the time for the formation of seedlings, due to \nthe lower availability of fertilizers.\n\nRegarding the physical characteristics of the \nsubstrates, properties such as density, total porosity and \nwater retention capacity influence the development of the \nplants (COSTA; DANTAS, 2009) and the management \nto be used over cultivation. The reduction in the particle \nsize resulted in an increase in the density of Pinus needles. \nHowever, the increase in the needles percentage to the \ncommercial substrate provided a reduction in density \nbecause Humosolo ES\u00ae had a density as many as four \ntimes of that of the needles. According to K\u00e4mpf et al. \n(2006), substrates with a density of less than 300 kg m-\u00b3 are \nrecommended for use in multicellular trays; with density \nbetween 200 and 400 kg m-\u00b3, they are recommended for \npots up to 15 cm high; and density of 300 to 500 kg m-\u00b3 is \nsuggested for pots with 20 to 30 cm in height. According \nto this classification, all the formulations tested in this \nstudy had adequate density to be used in pots. This result \nconfirms the hypothesis of the use of Pinus needles in the \ncomposition of substrates since the search for new organic \nmaterials that meet these requirements is fundamental for \nthe development of a new substrate as a large part of the \norganic materials such as barks and bagasse showed higher \ndensities than those recommended for cultivation in pots. \n\nThe density of a substrate can be altered by the \npacking density, associated with the moisture content of \nthe material. Changes in density over cultivation of the \nplants modify the physical properties of the substrate. \nTherefore, the increase in solids content per volume unit \nmay influence the voids ratio (pore to solids ratio), total \nporosity, aeration space, water retention capacity and \nroot penetrability (mechanical impedance) (FERMINO; \nK\u00c4MPF, 2012). Among these changes, those occurring \nin water retention and mechanical impedance standout \nas problems with excess water and difficulties in the \npenetrability of the substrate may occur, damaging the \ndevelopment of the plants. Hence, the higher the substrate \ncompaction, the greater the percentage of malformed \nseedlings.\n\nIt was possible to observe from the water retention \ncurve that the substrates with higher density had a \nhigher percentage of solids, while the use of needles \n\nin the formulations provided a larger aeration space. \nNeedles with 3.5 mm provided a higher percentage of \nsolids, a smaller aeration space and a greater amount of \nreadly available water in relation to the use of 8.0 mm \ngranulometry needles (Figure 2). According to Faria et \nal. (2013) and Souza et al. (2010), the aeration space \nis considered a determinant factor in the quality of the \nsubstrates, as it provides greater root hair development, \nwhich promotes an increase in the absorption of water and \nnutrients (BELL\u00c9, 2001).\n\nThe differences found in the physical characterization \nfor the different formulations do not make unfeasible their \nuse as substrates. However, care should be taken with the \nfrequency of irrigation adopted, since the low percentage \nof available water compared to the ideal parameters is \neasily corrected with a higher frequency of irrigation.\n\nAlthough the substrates showed different physical \ncharacteristics, they did not influence the emergence \nprocess of the \u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d rootstock (Table \n2). The average time of emergency was approximately \n35 days; emergence speed index rate was 0.03, and the \npercentage of seedlings formed was greater than 93% in \nall treatments. Rieth et al. (2012) when evaluating the \ndevelopment of citrus rootstocks also did not verify the \ninfluence of the substrate on the final values of emergence. \nHowever, according to S\u00e1 et al. (2015), the salinity of the \nsubstrate may generate imbalances in the germination, \nwhich was not verified in the present study because the \nlow electrical conductivity and the low water retention of \nthe mixtures, associated to the high frequency of irrigation, \nprovided excellent emergency rates.\n\nIn relation to height (Figure 3A) and diameter \n(Figure 3B) of the seedlings, a negative quadratic tendency \nwas found as the proportion of needles was increased in \nthe composition of the substrates, with a maximum point \nbetween 25 and 50% leaf treatments. After 40 days of \nsowing, as the treatments had the same pH range and \nEC, remaining stable until the end of the experiment, the \nsuperior growth of the seedlings grown in the formulations \ncontaining 25 and 50% of needles is likely to be explained \nby the characteristics (Figure 2) where the water retention \ncurves were very similar, which may have benefited from \nthe adopted management.\n\nThe treatments that provided the greatest values for \nthe height and diameter of the seedlings also provided the \ngreatest number of leaves (Figure 3C) and leaf area (Figure \n3D). The treatment composed of 100% of Pinus needles \nconferred a lower growth rate, due to the low EC and lower \nretention of water in relation to the other substrates. The \npure commercial substrate allowed a superior result only \nwhen compared to the 100% needles treatment, evidencing \nthat the addition of this material to the alkaline substrate \ngenerated benefit, assuring a better growth of the \u201cFepagro \nC37 Reck\u201d rootstock.\n\n\n\n5Potential of Pinus elliottii Engelm. needles as substrate conditioner for the production of \u201cFepagro C37 Reck\u201d ...\n\nRev.

The maximum accumulation point of dry \nbiomass of the seedlings was verified between treatments \nwith 25 and 50% needles. This result is justified by the \nlower retention of water and low fertility of substrates \nwith a high percentage of needles. \n\nThe substrate Humosolo ES\u00ae showed higher \nelectrical conductivity but did not influence positively \nthe seedlings development, evidencing that the physical \n\ncharacteristics had a greater influence on the growth of \nthese plants. Also, the lack of needles in the substrate \ncomposition provided a higher percentage of remaining \nwater, buffer water and solids, so it was evident the greater \nretention of water in relation to the other treatments, \npossibly causing damage to the growth of the seedlings. \nHowever, the association of the Pinus elliottii needles with \nthe substrate Humosolo ES\u00ae resulted in a reduction in the \namount of solids and, consequently, an increase in total \nporosity, providing the ideal conditions for the \u201cFepagro \nC37\u201d rootstock plants to express their potential growth.\n\nTable 1.
