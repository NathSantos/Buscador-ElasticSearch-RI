Temos colaborado durante nove anos, e \u00e9 claro que ela merece cr\u00e9ditos dos sucessos acad\u00e9micos que j\u00e1 alcancei. A Prof. Marina tem-me dado conselhos preciosos ao longo do meu percurso cient\u00edfico e deu-me oportunidade de estudar hidr\u00e1rios de mar profundo colhidos ao longo de diversas campanhas cient\u00edficas. Foi tamb\u00e9m gra\u00e7as \u00e0 Prof. Marina que o meu trabalho de doutoramento foi integrado em importantes projectos de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o europeus como o Hermes, Hermione e LusoMarBol, que me providenciaram importante apoio financeiro para prosseguir com os objectivos da tese. Muito obrigado por aquelas corre\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00faltima hora e por todos os restantes apoios Prof. Marina.\nO Prof. Alex Rogers \u00e9-me uma refer\u00eancia importante, um \u00eddolo em ci\u00eancia marinha, e sinto-me bastante sortudo por ele ter orientado o meu trabalho desde 2006. Comecei a trabalhar na Zoological Society of London (ZSL), por coincid\u00eancia, praticamente ao mesmo tempo de Alex, e tive o privil\u00e9gio de ele me ter ensinado directamente novas t\u00e9cnicas laboratoriais. Muitas an\u00e1lises moleculares foram realizadas na ZSL essencialmente no in\u00edcio do doutoramento, e Alex e muita gente da ZSL deram-me perce\u00e7\u00e3o de uma dimens\u00e3o superior de ci\u00eancia, e de m\u00e9todos de an\u00e1lises moleculares efetivos e r\u00e1pidos. Alex Rogers tamb\u00e9m providenciou excelentes coment\u00e1rios e correc\u00e7\u00f5es aos manuscritos. Obrigado Alex pelo suporte ao meu trabalhosas suas palavras am\u00e1veis deram-se uma \u00f3tima energia para prosseguir o trabalho com confian\u00e7a e determina\u00e7\u00e3o.\nO trabalho aqui apresentado foi apenas conseguido gra\u00e7as a muitas outras colabora\u00e7\u00f5es e interc\u00e2mbios cient\u00edficos com bastantes pessoas.\nAurora Beltr\u00e1n-Torres deu-me excelentes bases em taxonom\u00eda \u2018tradicional\u2019 (de corais p\u00e9treos) em ECOSUR - M\u00e9xico, durante o \u00faltimo ano de licenciatura.\nO meu mestrado em \u2018Biodiversidade e Recursos Gen\u00e9ticos\u2019, no CIBIO -Universidade do Porto, deu-me excelentes bases nas an\u00e1lises filogen\u00e9ticas moleculares (posteriormente aplicadas a hidrozo\u00e1rios). Os professores Nuno Ferrand e James Harris, assim como uma s\u00e9rie de colegas do CIBIO, deram-me valiosos ensinamentos na minha introdu\u00e7\u00e3o ao \u2018mundo da gen\u00e9tica\u2019.\nA Dr Medel Dolores (Univ. de Sevilha - Espanha) deu-me treino valios\u00edssimo na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o morfol\u00f3gica de hidr\u00e1rios durante a minha tese de mestrado, e tamb\u00e9m me providenciou um primeiro apoio com a pesquisa bibliogr\u00e1fica relacionada com hidrozo\u00e1rios. A Dr Medel foi ent\u00e3o a pessoa que me facilitou primariamente o meu trabalho na taxonomia de hidr\u00e1rios.\nO Prof. Fran Ramil (Univ. de Vigo - Espanha) recebeu-me na sua institui\u00e7\u00e3o (por uma semana no primeiro ano do doutoramento) para discutir a taxonomia de hidr\u00e1rios Plumulariidae e Lafoeidae. Fran \u00e9 um reconhecido taxonomista de hidr\u00e1rios e foi um grande prazer conhec\u00ea-lo e aprender com ele.\nO Dr Peter Schuchert (Museu de Hist\u00f3ria Natural de Genebra - Sui\u00e7a) \u00e9 talvez o melhor taxonomista de hidrozo\u00e1rios da actualidade. Sinto-me sortudo por ele me ter treinado na sistem\u00e1tica de hidrozo\u00e1rios, durante um total de duas\nsemanas que passei em Genebra (uma em 2005 durante o mestrado, a outra a meio do doutoramento). Peter tamb\u00e9m me ensinou pacientemente os protocolos de an\u00e1lises moleculares aplic\u00e1veis a hidr\u00e1rios. Mantivemos regular contato cientifico por email desde que nos conhecemos, sendo Peter Schuchert o meu professor mais completo de sistem\u00e1tica de hidrozo\u00e1rios.\nDeverei tamb\u00e9m agradecer as organiza\u00e7\u00f5es dos (dois \u00faltimos) workshops da Hydrozoan Society. Esses workshops deram-me \u00f3timas oportunidades de conhecer e acompanhar o trabalho de grandes refer\u00eancias da sistem\u00e1tica e ecologia de hidr\u00e1rios, tais como os professores Wim Vervoort, Ferdinando Boero, Alvaro Pe\u00f1a Cantero, Stefano Piraino, Allen Collins, etc. Foi tamb\u00e9m interessante conhecer a nova gera\u00e7\u00e3o de colegas com trabalho algo similar, destacando o Dr Lucas Lecl\u00e8re.\nAndrew Cabrinovic (Museu de Hist\u00f3ria Natural de Londres - Reino Unido) abriu-me as portas das cole\u00e7\u00f5es de hidr\u00e1rios do MHN de Londres. Foi um prazer estudar muito material tipo desse museu, e muitos hidr\u00e1rios acondicionados e identificados pelo grande taxonomista Paul Cornelius.\nO staff do Museu de Hist\u00f3ria Natural de Paris - Fran\u00e7a (nomeadamente Aude Andouche, Pierre Lozouet e Pascale Joannot) permitiu-me o estudo de esp\u00e9cimes de Nemertesia depositados nesse museu. As cole\u00e7\u00f5es biol\u00f3gicas e bibliogr\u00e1ficas do MHN de Paris sust\u00eam grande parte da hist\u00f3ria da biologia marinha e senti-me privilegiado em investigar parte dessas cole\u00e7\u00f5es.\nUm grande objetivo desta tese foi amostrar hidr\u00e1rios bent\u00f3nicos por mergulho com escafandro aut\u00f3nomo em diversas localiza\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1guas costeiras Portuguesas, incluindo os A\u00e7ores e Madeira. Pessoalmente tamb\u00e9m ambicionei conhecer as costas Portuguesas debaixo de \u00e1gua, e muitas pessoas e institui\u00e7\u00f5es ajudaram-me a alcan\u00e7ar esses prop\u00f3sitos.\nIniciei a amostragem de hidr\u00e1rios por mergulho no ver\u00e3o de 2007, na costa Algarvia e Vicentina, em colabora\u00e7\u00e3o com o colega Andr\u00e9 Moura (Univ. de Durham - UK) que estava estudando golfinhos no seu veleiro. Andr\u00e9 e os colegas Claudia Ferraz, Catarina Silva e Jos\u00e9 P\u00f3voa foram os companheiros de mergulho e providenciaram uma \u00f3tima companhia de proximidade debaixo de \u00e1gua. Os centros de mergulho \u2018Aveirosub\u2019 de \u00cdlhavo e \u2018Pinguim sub' de Portim\u00e3o, providenciaram generosamente apoio log\u00edstico para os mergulhos.\nEm 2008 tive oportunidade de participar na \u2018LusoExpedi\u00e7\u00e3o Olympus 2008\u2019, para amostrar hidr\u00e1rios dos picos do Banco Gorringe. Experienciei o melhor mergulho da minha vida nesta expedi\u00e7\u00e3o, mas tamb\u00e9m os maiores n\u00edveis de adrenalina por mergulhar em local t\u00e3o remoto. Felizmente a expedi\u00e7\u00e3o foi um sucesso e tenho portanto de agradecer aos Professores Pinto Abreu e Gon\u00e7alo Calado (ambos da Universidade Lus\u00f3fona - Portugal) o convite de participa\u00e7\u00e3o. Estou tamb\u00e9m grato aos mergulhadores/colegas Jos\u00e9\nTourais, Pedro Neves, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Borges, Joana Xavier, Jo\u00e3o Tiago Tavares e M\u00f3nica Albuquerque por me facilitarem a amostragem de hidr\u00e1rios. No geral a tripula\u00e7\u00e3o dessa expedi\u00e7\u00e3o foi fant\u00e1stica.\nEm Julho de 2008 viajei para os A\u00e7ores para amostrar hidr\u00e1rios por mergulho. A gente a\u00e7oriana recebeu-me muito bem, e tenho de enviar um especial obrigado a: Dinis Geraldes e Paulo Lu\u00eds (Nerus diving center - S\u00e3o Miguel); Maria Ana Dionisio, Jo\u00e3o Brum, Andreia Cunha e a Prof. Ana Costa (Univ.\nagradecimentos (cont.)\ndos A\u00e7ores - ilha de S\u00e3o Miguel); e aos centros de mergulho Dive Azores' (ilha do Faial) e \u2018Mareocidental' (ilha das Flores).\nAgrade\u00e7o tamb\u00e9m ao Prof. Ricardo Santos, Dr Filipe Porteiro e Valentina Torres (Dep. de Oceanografia e Pescas - Univ. dos A\u00e7ores) por me facilitarem o estudo de hidr\u00e1rios j\u00e1 amostrados de \u00e1guas profundas dos A\u00e7ores.\nEm Setembro de 2008 amostrei hidr\u00e1rios em \u00e1guas costeiras da Ilha da Madeira. Estou extremamente grato ao Dr. Manuel Biscoito e Dr. Ricardo Ara\u00fajo (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o de Biologia Marinha do Funchal) pelo apoio log\u00edstico com os mergulhos e por me facilitarem o estudo de hidr\u00e1rios de \u00e1guas profundas depositados na cole\u00e7\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica do Museu Municipal do Funchal. Claudia Ferraz, o Prof. Peter Wirtz e Ricardo Ara\u00fajo foram fant\u00e1sticos companheiros de mergulho na Madeira. Tenho de lhes agradecer a proximidade debaixo de \u00e1gua e a partilha de conhecimentos acerca das peculiaridades da ilha.\nEm Agosto de 2009 amostrei hidr\u00e1rios no lindo arquip\u00e9lago das Berlengas. A Reserva Natural das Berlengas foi extremamente am\u00e1vel em providenciar alojamento e transporte de barco entre locais de mergulho, por interm\u00e9dio de Lurdes Morais, Ant\u00f3nio Casanova e os restantes membros da reserva que conheci. Agrade\u00e7o aos meus colegas de mergulho Teresa Amaro e ao experiente mergulhador \u2018local' Pedro Andrade e Silva. O m\u00edtico Ant\u00f3nio Pata teve a paci\u00eancia de nos enviar as garrafas de mergulho reabastecidas de ar por barco para ilha.\nO Prof. Pedro Gomes (Univ. do Minho - Portugal) acompanhou-me debaixo de \u00e1gua durante dois mergulhos extraordin\u00e1rios (organizados por ele) perto de Viana do Castelo - norte de Portugal.\nTrabalhar na Zoological Society of London foi extraordin\u00e1rio. Trabalhei entre cientistas de grande qualidade, aumentei o meu conhecimento sobre assuntos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o animal, e aprendi diversas t\u00e9cnicas de an\u00e1lises filogen\u00e9ticas moleculares. Destaco os colegas fant\u00e1sticos que mais me ajudaram na ZSL: Bill Jordan, Dada Gotelli, Chris Yesson, Robert Pickles, Michelle Taylor, Kirsty Kemp and Ruth Brown.\nOs colegas do LEME (Laborat\u00f3rio de Ecologia Marinha e Estuarina) na Universidade de Aveiro quebraram a monotonia durante as bastantes horas que passei \u00e0 lupa ou microsc\u00f3pio a observar os animais. Susana Oliveira, F\u00e1bio Matos e Isabel Oliveira foram \u00f3timos colegas e amigos. As colegas Clara Rodrigues, Ana Hil\u00e1rio e Luciana G\u00e9nio amostraram muitos dos hidr\u00e1rios de mar profundo do Golfo de C\u00e1dis e/ou Mar de Alboran aqui mencionados.\nDedico um grande agradecimento aos meus amigos e em especial aos meus familiares chegados - pais, irm\u00e3, tios e sobrinhos - por toda a amizade e palavras de apoio. Os meus gatos deram-me uma \u00f3tima companhia no \u00faltimo per\u00edodo da escrita de artigos. Os meus tempos de escutismo preparam-me para partir \u00e0 aventura e lutar pelos meus objetivos. Os meus pais foram os pilares da minha educa\u00e7\u00e3o e o alcan\u00e7ar deste doutoramento n\u00e3o teria sido poss\u00edvel sem o amor, apoio financeiro, palavras de encorajamento e \u00f3timos conselhos que deram. Agrade\u00e7o-vos imenso.\nacknowledgements\nThe supervisors were fundamental to concretize the aims of the work herein presented.\nProf. Marina Cunha has been supervising my work since my early steps in scientific research. We have been collaborating for nine years, and of course she deserves credits of the academic successes that I have already achieved. Prof. Marina have been giving me precious advices along my scientific path, and gave me opportunity to study deep-sea hydroids collected along several oceanographic campaigns. It was also thanks to Prof. Marina that my Ph.D. work was integrated in important European research projects like Hermes, Hermione and LusoMarBol, that gave important financial support to pursue with the aims of thesis. Many thanks for those last-minute corrections and for all the other supports Prof. Marina.\nProf. Alex Rogers is an important reference for me, an idol in marine science, and I feel very lucky that he has supervised my work since 2006. We started coincidently to work at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) at about the same time, and I had the privilege to learn new laboratorial techniques directly from Alex. Many molecular analyses were made at the ZSL mainly at the beginning of the Ph.D., and Alex and many people of ZSL gave me perception of a superior dimension of science, and of fast and effective methods of molecular analyses. Alex Rogers also provided excellent comments and corrections to the manuscripts. Thank you Alex for being so supportive of my work.your kind words gave me a good energy to pursue the work with confidence and determination.\nThe work herein presented was only achieved thanks to several other scientific exchanges and collaborations with many persons.\nAurora Beltr\u00e1n-Torres gave me excellent basis on \u2018traditional\u2019 taxonomy (of stony corals) in ECOSUR - M\u00e9xico, during the final year of my B.Sc..\nMy M.Sc. degree in \u2018biodiversity and genetic resources\u2019, in CIBIO - Univ. of Porto, gave me an excellent basis for molecular phylogenetic analyses (applied latter to hydrozoans). The professors Nuno Ferrand and James Harris, as well as many colleagues of CIBIO, gave me valuable lessons in my introduction to the \u2018world of genetics\u2019.\nDr Medel Dolores (Univ. of Sevilla - Spain) gave me valuable training in the morphological identification of hydroids during my M.Sc. thesis and provided me an important first help with the bibliographic research related with hydrozoans. Dr Medel was therefore the person that primarily facilitated my work on the taxonomy of hydroids.\nProf. Fran Ramil (Univ. of Vigo - Spain) received me in his institution (for one week in the first year of Ph.D.) to discuss the taxonomy of Plumulariidae and Lafoeidae hydroids. Fran is a renewed taxonomist of hydroids and it was a great pleasure to met him and learn from him.\nDr Peter Schuchert (Natural History Museum of Geneva - Switzerland) is perhaps the best hydrozoan taxonomist presently. I feel lucky that he trained me on hydrozoan systematics, during a total of two weeks that I spent in Geneva (one in 2005 during the M.Sc., the other by the middle of Ph.D.). Peter\nalso taught me patiently the protocols for molecular analyses applied to hydroids. We kept regular scientific contact by email since we met; being Peter Schuchert my most complete professor of hydrozoan systematics.\nI must also acknowledge the organizations of the (last two) workshops of the Hydrozoan Society. These workshops gave me great opportunities to meet and follow the work of great references of hydrozoan systematics and ecology, such as the professors Wim Vervoort, Ferdinando Boero, Alvaro Pe\u00f1a Cantero, Stefano Piraino, Allen Collins, etc. It was also interesting to meet the new generation of colleagues with work somewhat similar, evidencing Dr Lucas Lecl\u00e8re.\nAndrew Cabrinovic (Natural History Museum of London - UK) opened me the doors of the hydrozoan collections of the NHM of London. It was a pleasure to study many type material of that museum, and many hydroids wrapped and identified by the great taxonomist Paul Cornelius.\nThe staff of the Natural History Museum of Paris - France (namely Aude Andouche, Pierre Lozouet and Pascale Joannot) allowed me the study of Nemertesia specimens deposited in that museum. The biological and bibliographic collections of the NHM of Paris hold much of the history of marine biology and I felt privileged to investigate part of these collections.\nA great aim of this thesis was to collect benthic hydroids by scuba-diving at several locations of Portuguese shallow waters, including the Azores and Madeira. Personally I also intended to perceive Portuguese coasts underwater, and many people and institutions helped me to achieve these endeavors.\nI started the hydroid sampling by scuba-diving during the summer of 2007, in the coasts of Algarve and Alentejo, in collaboration with the colleague Andr\u00e9 Moura (Univ. of Durham - UK) that was studying dolphins in his sailing boat. Andr\u00e9 and the colleagues Claudia Ferraz, Catarina Silva and Jos\u00e9 P\u00f3voa were the buddy-divers and provided a great company of proximity underwater. The diving centers \u2018Aveirosub\u2019 from \u00cdlhavo and \u2018Pinguim sub' from Portim\u00e3o, provided kind logistical support for the dives.\nIn 2008 I had opportunity to participate in the \u2018LusoExpedi\u00e7\u00e3o Olympus 2008\u2018 to collect hydroids from the peaks of the Gorringe Bank. I experienced the best dive of my life in this expedition, but also the higher levels of adrenaline for diving at such a remote place. Fortunately the expedition was a success and therefore I must thank Professors Pinto Abreu and Gon\u00e7alo Calado (both from the University Lus\u00f3fona - Portugal) the invitation of participation. I am also indebt to the divers/collegues Jos\u00e9 Tourais, Pedro Neves, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Borges, Joana Xavier, Jo\u00e3o Tiago Tavares and M\u00f3nica Albuquerque for facilitating me the hydroid sampling. In general the crew of that expedition was fantastic.\nIn July of 2008 I travelled to the Azores in order to collect hydroids by scubadiving. The Azorean people received me very good, and I must send a special thanks to: Dinis Geraldes and Paulo Lu\u00eds (Nerus diving center - S\u00e3o Miguel Island); Maria Ana Dionisio, Jo\u00e3o Brum, Andreia Cunha and Prof. Ana Costa (University of Azores - S\u00e3o Miguel island); and the diving centers teams of \u2018Dive Azores\u2019 (Faial Island) and \u2018Mareocidental\u2019 (Flores Island).\nThanks are also to Prof. Ricardo Santos, Dr Filipe Porteiro and Valentina Torres\nacknowledgements (cont.)\n(Department of Oceanography and Fisheries - Univ. of Azores) for facilitating me the study of deep-water hydroids already collected in the Azores.\nIn September of 2008 I collected shallow-water hydroids in the Madeira Island. I am extremely grateful to Dr. Manuel Biscoito and Dr. Ricardo Ara\u00fajo (Marine Biology Station of Funchal) for the logistical support with the dives and for allowing me the study of deep-water hydroids deposited in the biological collection of the Municipal Museum of Funchal. My great buddy-divers in Madeira were Claudia Ferraz, Prof. Peter Wirtz and Ricardo Ara\u00fajo. I must thank them the proximity underwater and share of knowledge about the peculiarities of the island.\nIn August of 2009 I collected hydroids in the beautiful archipelago of Berlengas. The Natural Reserve of Berlengas kindly provided accommodation and transport by boat between diving spots, on the behalf of Lurdes Morais, Ant\u00f3nio Casanova and the other staff of the reserve that I met. My buddydivers were Teresa Amaro and the experienced \u2018local\u2019 diver Pedro Andrade e Silva. The legendary Ant\u00f3nio Pata had the pacience to send us the diving-tanks refilled with air by boat to the island.\nProf. Pedro Gomes (Univ. Minho - Portugal) accompanied me underwater along two extraordinary dives (organized by him) close to Viana do Castelo -northern Portugal.\nWork at the Zoological Society of London was extraordinary. I worked amidst scientists of great quality, increased my knowledge on animal conservation issues and I learned several techniques of molecular phylogenetic analyses. I highlight the fantastic colleagues that helped me most at ZSL: Bill Jordan, Dada Gotelli, Chris Yesson, Robert Pickles, Michelle Taylor, Kirsty Kemp and Ruth Brown.\nThe colleagues from the LEME (Laborat\u00f3rio de Ecologia Marinha e Estuarina) at the University of Aveiro broke the monotony during the many hours I spent in front of the microscope staring at the animals. Susana Oliveira, F\u00e1bio Matos and Isabel Oliveira were great colleagues and friends. The colleagues Clara Rodrigues, Ana Hil\u00e1rio and Luciana G\u00e9nio collected many of the deep-sea hydroids herein mentioned from the Gulf of Cadiz and/or Alboran Sea.\nI dedicate a great acknowledgement to my friends and especially to my close familiars - parents, sister, uncles and nephews - for all the friendship and words of support. My cats gave me a fine company in the last period of writing papers. My old times of scout prepared me to leave for adventure and fight for my goals. My parents were the pillars of my education and the achievement of this Ph.D. would not have been possible without their love, financial support, words of encouragement and great advices.\nThank you a lot.\npalavras-chave\tHydrozoa; Leptothecata; Taxonom\u00eda; Filogen\u00e9tica; Filogeografia; Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o; esp\u00e9cies cripticas; Plumulariidae; Sertulariidae; Lafoeidae; Aglaopheniidae; costa Portuguesa; Golfo de C\u00e1dis; A\u00e7ores; Madeira; Mar de Alboran; Banco Gorringe; Atl\u00e2ntico; Mediterr\u00e2neo.\nresumo\tO estudo da fauna Portuguesa de Hydrozoa estava abandonado h\u00e1 mais de meio s\u00e9culo, exceto para o arquip\u00e9lago dos A\u00e7ores. Um dos principais objetivos do projecto de doutoramento foi contribuir com novos registos de hidrozo\u00e1rios para uma perce\u00e7\u00e3o mais precisa da diversidade real de hidrozo\u00e1rios de \u00e1guas Portuguesas, incluindo os arquip\u00e9lagos dos A\u00e7ores e Madeira, e \u00e1reas geogr\u00e1ficas pr\u00f3ximas, para habitats compreendidos entre o mar profundo e o n\u00edvel intertidal. Hidr\u00e1rios de \u00e1guas superficiais de diversas regi\u00f5es marinhas Portuguesas (incluindo o Banco Gorringe) foram amostradas por mergulho com escafandro aut\u00f3nomo. Hidr\u00e1rios do mar profundo, dos A\u00e7ores, Madeira, Golfo de C\u00e1dis e Mar de Alboran, foram colhidos por investigadores de diferentes institui\u00e7\u00f5es durante variadas campanhas oceanogr\u00e1ficas. Foi efetuada amostragem espor\u00e1dica de hidr\u00e1rios por mergulho com escafandro aut\u00f3nomo no Reino Unido, Malta e Espanha. Foram identificadas mais de 300 esp\u00e9cies de hidr\u00e1rios e foram geradas cerca de 600 sequ\u00eancias do \u2018DNA barcode' de hidrozo\u00e1rios 16S mRNA. As families Sertulariidae, Plumulariidae, Lafoeidae, Hebellidae, Aglaopheniidae, Campanulinidae,\tHalopterididae, Kirchenpaueriidae, Haleciidae e Eudendriidae, foram estudadas em detalhe.

One of the main aims of this Ph.D. project was to contribute new hydrozoan records leading to a more accurate perception of the actual hydrozoan diversity found in Portuguese waters, including the archipelagos of Azores and Madeira, and neighbouring geographical areas, for habitats ranging from the deep sea to the intertidal. Shallow water hydroids from several Portuguese marine regions (including the Gorringe Bank) were sampled by scuba-diving. Deep-water hydroids, from the Azores, Madeira, Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea, were collected by researchers of different institutions during several oceanographic campaigns. Occasional hydroid sampling by scuba-diving was performed in the UK, Malta and Spain. Over 300 hydroid species were identified and about 600 sequences of the hydrozoan \u2018DNA barcode' 16S mRNA were generated. The families Sertulariidae, Plumulariidae, Lafoeidae, Hebellidae, Aglaopheniidae, Campanulinidae, Halopterididae, Kirchenpaueriidae, Haleciidae and Eudendriidae, were studied in greater detail. About 350 16S sequences were generated for these taxa, allowing phylogenetic, phylogeographic and evolutionary inferences, and also more accurate taxonomic identifications. Phylogenetic analyses integrated molecular and morphological characters. Subsequent results revealed: particularly high levels of cryptic biodiversity, polyphyly in many taxonomic groups, pairs of species that were synonymous, the identity of several varieties as valid species, and highlighted phylogeographic associations of hydroids in deep and shallow-water areas of the NE Atlantic and W Mediterranean. It was proved that many (but not all) marine hydroid species with supposedly widespread vertical and/or horizontal geographical distributions, correspond in fact to complexes of cryptic taxa. This study further revealed that, in the NE Atlantic, shallow environments sustain higher hydrozoan diversity and abundance, but the importance of bathyal habitats as a source of phylogenetic diversity was also revealed. The Azorean seamounts were shown to be particularly important in the segregation of populations of hydroids with reduced dispersive potential. The bathyal habitats of the Gulf of Cadiz proved to harbour a considerably high number of cryptic species, which may mainly be a consequence of habitat heterogeneity and convergence of various water masses in the Gulf.\nThe main causes proposed for speciation and population divergence of hydroids were: species population size, dispersal mechanisms and plasticity to inhabit different environmental conditions, but also the influence of oceanic currents (and its properties), habitat heterogeneity, climate change and continental drift. Higher phylogenetic resolution obtained for the family Plumulariidae revealed particularly that glacial cycles likely facilitated population divergence, ultimately speciation, and also faunal evolutionary transitions from deep to shallow waters.\nabstract (cont.)\nContents\n1\tGeneral Introduction...............................................

Out of c. 46 phyla of animals: 35 are found in the oceans, 14 of which are exclusively marine and several others are mainly marine (e.g. Cnidaria; Sala &amp; Knowlton 2006). However, the opposite appears true at the species level with ca. 1.4 million species having been described from terrestrial environments but only about 194.5 thousand from marine ecosystems (Mora et al. 2011). This can be explained essentially by the present lack of knowledge of biodiversity of marine environments, and by the higher investment that has been made in biological terrestrial studies. These results can be also partially explained by the high diversity of terrestrial arthropods but may also reflect the large, open-nature of marine ecosystems, resulting in large geographical distributions of populations and species and lower rates of allopatric speciation over geological time scales. This is thought to have resulted in near cosmopolitan distributions of many species, with perhaps the most striking examples being among the hydroids (Stepanyants 1980; Cornelius 1995a, b).\nHydroids or Hydrozoa were classified under the \u2018Vermes\u2019 (invertebrates) as \u2018Zoophyta\u2019 (plant-animals) by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th Edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. Hydroids consist of polyps which primitively have a central mouth surrounded by tentacles armed with nematocysts. These polyps can occur as solitary individuals in some species but in most usually occur as colonies where each is joined by a tube of tissue and the whole is protected by a rigid exoskeleton, the perisarc (Cornelius 1995a,b). Almost all colonies are fixed to the seabed (sessile) and have a variety of forms from root-like stolons to erect tree-like structures that can be conspicuous amongst the emergent epifauna of coastal and deep-sea ecosystems. Many common hydroids from the coastal waters of Europe were described originally by Linnaeus and, as many species in the region, have subsequently been recorded as having a near cosmopolitan distribution (Cornelius 1995a,b,\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\ne.g. Obelia geniculata (Linnaeus, 1758); Plumularia setacea (Linnaeus, 1758); Amphisbetia operculata (Linnaeus, 1758)). In some cases, the widespread distribution of hydroids may result from their dispersal capabilities. Some forms (e.g. O. geniculata) have a reproductive pelagic medusoid stage which releases gametes that undergo external fertilization producing a pelagic planula stage. In other cases (e.g. most of the Plumulariidae) the medusoid stage is reduced, effectively being retained by the hydroid colony and fertilization is external with most species being dioecious (colonies that have separate sexes). The resultant planula larvae swim or crawl away and are generally shortlived, although those of some species may take up to several days to settle and metamorphose. Many hydroids have the ability to raft on natural substrata, such as kelp holdfasts (hydrochory, e.g. Cornelius 1992, 1995a,b), and many can grow on artificial surfaces, often being a significant element of marine fouling communities (e.g. Lewbel et al. 1987; Relini et al. 1998; Yan et al. 2006) so passive dispersal on natural and anthropogenic materials is likely for many species. The hydroids are anatomically simple animals with few morphological characters, great phenotypic plasticity and many shared characters that represent homoplasies. There are about 3700 described species (Bouillon et al. 2006) but the taxonomy of the group is problematic and the potential for morphologically cryptic taxa is high (e.g. Govindarajan et al. 2005a; Schuchert 2005a; Moura et al. 2008, 2011a, c, d). Often identification of species can only be accomplished at a particular life-stage or when reproductive structures are present. Furthermore, taxonomic expertise in the group is diminishing and existing taxonomists tend to focus their studies only on particular life-stages and/or taxonomic groups. This \u2018taxonomic impediment' makes resolution of species difficult for many hydroids and the perceived widespread cosmopolitanism of the group may be erroneous.\nMarine hydroids have a great variety of forms, are important components of coastal and deep-sea benthic habitats, provide substratum for the settlement of other taxa and are some of the most important sessile predators and competitors for bottom space (e.g. Bouillon et al. 2006). However, despite their importance in marine ecosystems, the scientific study of these animals has been highly neglected and their systematic relations are contentious and poorly resolved largely because of their morphological simplicity and plasticity. Given both the ecological significance and taxonomic difficulties of the hydrozoans, the clarification of their true diversity and a better understanding of their\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nevolution is important. An incorrect discrimination of taxa may negatively influence ecological, biogeographic, evolutionary and applied-biotechnological studies, as well as management and conservation planning (e.g. Knowlton 2000; Bickford et al. 2007).\nBarcoding life with standardized molecular biomarkers is increasingly being used successfully as an aid for the identification of taxa that may represent distinct and/or new species (after works of Floyd et al. 2002; Hebert et al. 2003a, b). At a time when biodiversity studies are being seen as important because of human-induced environmental change but are inhibited by the taxonomic impediment (e.g. Boero 2010), DNA barcoding has revitalized taxonomy by revealing a hitherto overlooked but significant cryptic diversity (e.g. Hebert et al. 2004a, b; Janzen et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2006). Such approaches also allow: the connection of life stages and genders, where species are sexually dimorphic (Beskansky et al. 2003; Janzen et al. 2005); the clarification of problems of synonymy (Alroy 2002), and the attraction of more funds and public interest in taxonomic research (Hebert &amp; Gregory 2005). Moreover, DNA barcoding approaches have revealed the potential to test taxonomic hypotheses, including phylogenetic relationships, and can also provide new insights into evolution, especially if it is integrated with other types of data, including molecular, morphological, distributional, ecological and behavioral (e.g. Dayrat 2005; Hebert &amp; Gregory 2005; Savolainen et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2005; Will et al. 2005; Padial et al. 2010; Moura et al. 2011a, b, c).\nMost \u2018DNA barcoding' studies have focused on ca. 650 base pairs of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene as the main barcoding gene for metazoans. This is because COI is easily amplified from diverse taxa using broad-range primers under variable laboratory conditions and protocols (Folmer et al. 1994; Hebert et al. 2003a,b; Ivanova et al. 2007; Kerr et al. 2007). It is also readily aligned for sequence comparisons, and is sufficiently divergent to discriminate species effectively across a variety of phyla, and therefore a large set of data from this gene has already been accumulated in publicly accessible data bases (Hebert et al. 2004a, b). Presently, over 1 300 000 DNA \u2018barcodes' corresponding to more than 110 800 species (www.barcodinglife.org) are already gathered. However, other genes have also been used as a basis for barcoding or for species discovery (e.g. Markmann &amp; Tautz 2005; Mathews 2006), especially where COI does not amplify reliably for the taxon under study (Cook et al. 2005; Bhadury et al. 2006), has failed to\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nresolve species as a result of slow evolution of the mitochondrial genome (e.g. Cnidaria; Porifera; France et al. 1996; van Oppen et al. 1999; Shearer et al. 2002; citing R. Watkins, pers. comm.; Duran et al. 2004; Hellberg 2006; Worheide 2006), or where divergent COI sequences have been found within species (Vences et al. 2005). DNA barcoding, especially when used for species discovery, remains contentious, especially amongst taxonomists (Moritz &amp; Cicero 2004; DeSalle et al. 2005; Ebach &amp; Holdrege 2005; Brower 2006). Drawbacks identified with DNA barcoding approaches, have centred around the resolution of intra- and interspecific variation in DNA sequences (Hewitt 1996; Avise &amp; Johns 1999; Hebert et al. 2003b; Moritz &amp; Cicero 2004; Meyer &amp; Paulay 2005) including problems associated with inherited symbionts (Hurst &amp; Jiggins 2005), with introgression/ hybridization (e.g. Masta et al. 2002; Babik et al. 2005) or with very recent speciation (e.g. Johnson &amp; Cicero 2004); the reliance on single-gene trees (DeSalle et al. 2005); the lack of comprehensive sampling of species of the taxa under study (Moritz &amp; Cicero 2004; DeSalle et al. 2005); and failure to sample voucher specimens or to take account of existing taxonomic knowledge. Whilst these criticisms are valid, the linking of DNA sequence data with other information, such as geographical, ecological, biological or morphological data can provide a powerful way to break out of the tautological or circular reasoning that lies behind an oversimplified application of barcoding, especially when identifying new taxa (DeSalle et al. 2005). Examples of this include the identification of covariation between morphology and barcode sequence clusters in South American Lepidoptera (Hajibabaei et al. 2006) and the use of mating trials to confirm that deep genetic lineages within the bryozoan Celleporella hyalina are reproductively isolated (Gomez et al. 2007). Thus, DNA barcoding or DNA taxonomy can be a modern complement to the classification of the most basic unit of biodiversity, the species, testing and making systematics more practical, rigorous and complete.\nIn Hydrozoa the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene has been more widely accepted for barcoding purposes than COI (Moura et al. 2008, 2011a). COI and other mitochondrial genes (including 16S) exhibit slow evolutionary rates in most Anthozoa (McFadden et al. 2000, 2011; Shearer et al. 2002; Hellberg 2006; Shearer &amp; Coffroth 2008; Huang et al. 2008) and therefore COI has been assumed to be useless for DNA barcoding in this taxon. However, Sinniger et al. (2008) recommended that both COI and 16S markers can be useful as DNA barcodes of species of the order Zoantharia, as each gene has advantages\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nand disadvantages. COI has been the preferred mitochondrial gene to investigate species boundaries and phylogenetics of Scyphozoa (e.g. Dawson &amp; Jacobs 2001; Dawson &amp; Martin 2001; Holland et al. 2004; Dawson 2005a, b). The 16S marker has been less used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the Scyphozoa (e.g. 597 COI sequences are deposited in GenBank, in contrast to only 48 sequences of 16S), but has also been used successfully in the demarcation of scyphozoan species (e.g. Schroth et al. 2002; Licandro et al. 2010). Recently Ortman et al. (2010) and Bucklin et al. (2011) extrapolated that COI is \u2018broadly useful' for DNA barcoding of species across the Medusozoa (sister clade to Anthozoa, containing Scyphozoa, Cubozoa and Hydrozoa), but is not phylogenetically informative for higher taxonomic ranks. However, the medusozoans barcoded with COI by Ortman et al. (2010) and Bucklin et al. (2011) included a considerable number of Siphonophora (subclass of Hydrozoa), but only few sequences of Cubozoa, Scyphozoa or other subclasses of the Hydrozoa. Shearer et al. (2002) demonstrated that the mutational rate of COI in one hydrozoan species was low, as found in the Anthozoa, but Govindarajan et al. (2005a) found COI to be a faster evolving gene and a more phylogenetically informative one for hydrozoan species. Despite such incongruence or lack of comprehensive studies that test the efficacy of COI as a DNA barcode across Meduzosoa, from a practical point of view, the 16S gene has been found to be much easier to amplify than COI, particularly in the Anthoathecata and Leptothecata groups (Miglietta et al. 2009; C. J. Moura, pers. observation). As a result of the resolution and effectiveness of 16S rDNA for barcoding, DNA taxonomy and phylogenetic analyses of Hydrozoa, 1204 16S rDNA sequences are deposited in GenBank at the present time, compared to only 476 COI sequences (an increase of about 200% of 16S sequences \u2018banked' since the last count published by Moura et al. 2008). The 16S gene has allowed recognition and discrimination of nominal and cryptic hydrozoan species (including invasive taxa), but also revealed reasonable potential for phylogenetic, phylogeographic and evolutionary analyses (Bridge et al. 1995; Romano &amp; Palumbi 1997; Watkins &amp; Beckenbach 1999; Schierwater &amp; Ender 2000; Ender &amp; Schierwater 2003; Collins et al. 2005; Dunn et al. 2005; Govindarajan et al. 2005a, b; Schuchert 2005a, b, 2006; Fraser et al. 2006; Govindarajan et al. 2006; Schuchert &amp; Reiswig 2006; Galea &amp; Leclere 2007; Hemmrich et al. 2007; Leclere et al. 2007, 2009; Miglietta et al. 2007, 2009; Moura et al. 2007, 2008, 2011a, b, c, d; Cartwright et al. 2008; Altuna 2009; Cartwright &amp; Nawrocki 2010; Nawrocki et al. 2010;\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nPe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 2010; Miranda et al. 2010). For hydrozoans, 16S genetic information has been found to be consistent with nuclear genetic markers (e.g. Elongation Factor 1a, Miglietta et al. 2009; and ITS1 and ITS2, Miranda et al. 2010) and also morphology (e.g. Schuchert 2005a; Miglietta et al. 2009; Moura et al. 2011a, b, c, d), further evidence of its potential as a DNA barcoding gene.\nThe advent of molecular techniques has made available new additional characters for objective discrimination of taxa. As a result, cryptic or pseudocryptic species have been discovered across nearly all metazoan phyla (e.g. reviews of Knowlton 2000; Bickford et al. 2007; Trontelj &amp; Fiser 2009). In the Cnidaria, the reported cases of cryptic diversity are comparatively low compared to other major metazoan clades, such as the Porifera (Trontelj &amp; Fiser 2009). The limited discovery of cryptic species in cnidarians may result from a slow rate of genetic evolution, and/or it may be a consequence of regular hybridization (reviewed by Knowlton 2000). However, past studies have primarily focused on Anthozoa with the Hydrozoa having attracted relatively little attention. Recent studies have revealed cryptic or pseudocryptic species within the Hydrozoa (Govindarajan et al. 2005a; Schuchert 2005a; Miglietta et al. 2007, 2009; Moura et al. 2008, 2011a, c, d; Folino-Rorem et al. 2009), suggesting that hydrozoan diversity might be significantly underestimated. Furthermore, vast geographic areas remain unexplored and poorly sampled for Hydrozoa, including most of the deep sea. Despite a long history of research on hydrozoan systematics, dating back to the pre-Linnaean times, new taxa, even at the level of families are still being discovered (e.g. Moura et al. 2007).\nThe study of the Portuguese Hydrozoa fauna was abandoned for more than half a century (except for the Azores archipelago and more recently for the Madeira island) until the herein presented taxonomic and phylogenetic investigations of Moura (2011) and Moura et al. (2008, 2011a, b, c, d). Many \u2018classical\u2019 taxonomic studies of hydroids exist elsewhere in Europe, but molecular phylogenetic or evolutionary studies with these animals were still scarce in the old continent, uniquely with works of Schuchert (2005a) and Leclere et al. 2007, 2009). This lack of knowledge on systematics of hydroids of Portugal but also from the rest of European waters deserves scientific interest, especially when taking into consideration the usual ubiquity of hydroids in marine biotopes and their\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\ngreat biological significance (e.g. Bouillon et al. 2006). Furthermore, the Portuguese marine waters are in a key geographic position for biodiversity and biogeographic studies, because such territory represents an important biogeographic transition zone of the Boreal, Mediterranean and Mauritanian faunas. The small amount of research on hydroids of Portuguese continental waters was carried out by Nobre (1931, 1937) and Da Cunha (1940, 1941, 1944, 1950), who provided almost all our knowledge on hydroids of the Portuguese continental coast. Besides the fact that the taxonomic framework used by these authors is now obsolete, many localities of the coast were still unexplored. The Azores have been investigated in more detail by Rees &amp; White (1966) and Cornelius (1992). Despite their addition of new records to the faunal list and the important ideas on how these hydroids may have reached these islands, these authors did not sample the archipelago uniformly and many areas remained to investigate. The archipelago of Madeira is the region of Portugal that has received the least attention, with only very few records of some deep-sea hydroid species (Medel &amp; Vervoort 2000). More recently a list of hydroid species found in shallow-waters of Madeira was provided by Wirtz (2007).\nThe Plumulariidae, Aglaopheniidae, Lafoeidae and Sertulariidae, were the taxa studied in greater detail in this thesis, and are amongst the most specious hydrozoan families (Bouillon et al. 2006), being usually common in benthic communities of coastal to deep marine habitats worldwide. In these hydrozoan families, the medusoid phase is apparently suppressed from the life cycle of most of these hydroids (e.g. Bouillon et al. 2006). Instead colonies release planulae that are carried in the water column, before they settle on a substratum and metamorphose into a erect sessile colony. Because their dispersive pelagic stage is potentially short, gene-flow may be highly constrained by population size, the local current regime and availability and type of substrata. Such lifehistory traits suggest that dispersal in these hydroids likely fits a stepping-stone model. Therefore, because the organisms selected represent the earliest mobile metazoans, are extremely diverse, play important ecological roles, and a great part of these taxa have supposedly widespread horizontal and vertical distributions but limited dispersal mechanisms; they are ideal to test species boundaries, effective distributions of species, gene-flow between localities, and to reveal processes underlying marine phylogeography and speciation, including faunistic responses to environmental changes.\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nREFERENCES\nAlroy, J.

The numerous phylogenetic problems associated with hydrozoan systematics were approached by integrating diagnostic morphological characters with molecular techniques, namely phylogenetic analyses with 16S mRNA sequence data. The high 16S haplotype sampling obtained further allowed some phylogeographic and evolutionary inferences for the hydrozoan fauna of both shallow and deep waters of the NE Atlantic and western Mediterranean.\nTo achieve the above mentioned general aims, this project included the following specific tasks/aims:\n- To collect shallow-water hydroids from several locations representative of the Portuguese territory;\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\n-\tTo obtain (for taxonomic identification and phylogenetic analyses) hydrozoan samples previously collected by other researchers/staff of diverse scientific institutions, especially biological material from deep waters of Portugal and adjacent areas;\n-\tTo further obtain hydroids from occasional scuba diving sampling from different locations around Europe;\n-\tTo identify the hydrozoans collected personally or obtained through collaborative research, down to the taxonomic level of species/genus, whenever possible;\n-\tTo \u2018DNA barcode' the 16S mRNA marker, according to the diversity and ubiquity of taxa, and dedicate higher sampling effort to the hydrozoan families better represented in both shallow and deep waters of NE Atlantic and western Mediterranean;\n-\tTo apply molecular phylogenetic analyses with the \u2018sequence' data obtained and published in Genbank;\n-\tTo evaluate the potential of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene as a tool for DNA barcoding of hydroid species;\n-\tTo evaluate the systematic resolution of the mt 16S rRNA above the species level for addressing phylogenetic questions within the Class;\n-\tTo test the monophyletic status of the hydrozoan families, and to better represent its genera and species in phylogenetic analyses;\n-\tTo solve cases of complicated synonymies and erroneous species assignments to genera;\n-\tTo investigate whether hydroid species are widespread in geographical distribution or if they are in fact complexes of cryptic taxa segregated by depth, geographical barriers (e.g. continents) or distance;\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\n-\tTo explain the causes underlying cryptic or pseudocryptic hydrozoan diversity detected;\n-\tTo investigate potential patterns of morphological divergence accompanying speciation;\n-\tTo investigate the extent and direction of gene flow between non-contiguous and contiguous populations;\n-\tTo investigate the evolution of Hydrozoa morphs from deep to shallow waters (or the reverse), and whether or not this has occurred multiple times;\n-\tTo contribute for the understanding of how, from where and when hydroids reached the seamounts/islands of Azores;\n-\tTo investigate the correlation between the patterns and causes of speciation found, with major events of previous geological ages, such as alterations in oceanic currents and land barriers, glaciations and other large-scale climatic changes.\n2.2\tTHESIS ORGANIZATION\nThis dissertation is organized into three main parts: (I) Introduction; (II) Research Work; and (III) Final Remarks. Each of these is in turn composed of different chapters, in a total of ten and organized as follows.\nPart I - Introduction. This section consists of a brief introduction for framing the reader in the basis for the development of this project. It starts by summarising a General Introduction (Chapter 1) regarding the need of the execution of this thesis and ends presenting The Dissertation (Chapter 2) aims, rationale and organization.\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nPart II - Research Work. This section is presented in seven chapters (Chapter 3 to 9). Chapters 4 to 9 were structured as scientific manuscripts, and therefore each one contains its own abstract, theoretical introduction, specific aims, applied procedures, obtained results, respective discussion and conclusions. The sequence of inclusion of chapters (and of the manuscripts) in this dissertation, is intended to reveal the logical progression of this work and its increasing complexity, particularly in chapter 9.\n\u2022\tChapter 3 describes the data associated with the sampling stations studied specifically for this dissertation, and the respective taxa identified for each station. Some hydrozoan families (e.g. Haleciidae, Eudendriidae) mentioned particulary in Chapter 5 were not mentioned in Chapter 3 due to deadline constraints and the complex taxonomic problems of these groups. The list of stations and species of the hydroids collected from the Gorringe Bank are mentioned in Chapter 4.\n\u2022\tChapter 4 presents the hydrozoan fauna (including all the Leptothecata and Anthoathecata species) collected from the peaks of the Gorringe Bank during the \u2018LusoExpedigao Olympus 2008'. Some ecological and biogeographic considerations are presented.\n\u2022\tChapter 5 investigates the potential of the 16S gene to \u2018DNA barcode' hydroids, and highlights the potential of cryptic diversity in hydroids, as well as other taxonomic inconsistencies. This chapter was the basis for the research work developed in chapters 6 to 9.\n\u2022\tChapter 6 presents a manuscript concerning the phylogenetic relations and taxonomic problems associated with the family Sertulariidae. This research work revealed many probable cases of cryptic and pseudo-cryptic biodiversity, as well of potential synonymies. Some phylogeographic inferences are also presented.\n\u2022\tChapter 7 addresses phylogenetic relations of the putative Superfamily Lafoeoidea and of hydroids with campanulated hydrothecae (e.g. family Campanulinidae).This\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nmanuscript/chapter highlights profound problems in the taxonomy of these taxa. For example, the Superfamily Lafoeoidea was found polyphyletic, as well as its supposed families Lafoeidae and Hebellidae. High levels of potential cryptic diversity were also found. Some phylogeographic relations are also resolved.\n\u2022\tChapter 8 describes phylogenetic relationships of Aglaopheniidae from the northeast Atlantic and west Mediterranean. The highlights of this manuscript include the finding of several polyphyletic groups, probable cases of synonymies, and the identification of two undescribed species of Aglaophenia. Phylogeographic associations were again revealed.\n\u2022\tChapter 9 resolves phylogenetic relations of plumulariids by an integrative molecular approach supported by morphologic characters and by a \u2018molecular clock' approach. High levels of cryptic diversity are revealed, as well as important inferences on the mechanisms of hydrozoans population divergence and speciation. Phylogeographic assumptions supported by the dating of phylogenetic nodes were also performed.\nPart III - Final Remarks. Because specific discussions and conclusions from Chapter 4 to 9 are offered, this final part is a brief compilation of the main findings of all the research work presented in this dissertation.\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nPart II\nResearch Work\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nChapter 3\nTAXONOMIC LIST AND THE SAMPLING STATIONS OF LEPTOTHECATA HYDROIDS (CAMPANULINIDAE, TIARANNIDAE, HEBELLIDAE, LAFOEIDAE, SERTULARIIDAE, KIRCHENPAUERIIDAE, HALOPTERIDIDAE, PLUMULARIIDAE, A GLAOPHENIIDAE) FROM THE NE ATLANTIC AND WEST MEDITERRANEAN\nContents\n3.1\tINTRODUCTION......................................29\n3.2\tLIST OF THE STATIONS AND SPECIES STUDIED..........31\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis chapter presents the data associated with the sampling stations studied for this dissertation, with the respective taxa of 9 hydrozoan families (Campanulinidae, Tiarannidae, Hebellidae, Lafoeidae, Sertulariidae, Kirchenpaueriidae, Halopterididae, Plumulariidae and Aglaopheniidae) identified at each of these stations. These were the hydrozoan families best studied phylogenetically in the course of this Ph.D. thesis. The taxa with specimens \u2018DNA barcoded' for the 16S mRNA gene are identified in bold in the following faunal list presented in this chapter.\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nA high sampling effort of hydroids at selected localities along the Portuguese coasts was achieved by scuba diving up to depths of around 40 m. The mainland of Portugal was extensively sampled from north to south by scuba diving, as well as the Madeira Island, and three islands (S\u00e3o Miguel, Faial, Flores) of the Archipelago of the Azores. The hydrozoan fauna from the peaks of the Gorringe Bank (also located in waters of Portuguese jurisdiction) was also extensively studied taxonomically, but it is only presented in the next chapter of this dissertation. In order to complement faunal lists and phylogenetic analyses, occasional sampling by scuba diving was additionally performed in Terceira Island (Azores), Malta Island, Benidorm (Spain) and in the SW of the United Kingdom.\nSome shallow water hydroids were also sampled from ship hulls, pontoons, and artificial substrata in marinas and naval ports in selected points of the Portuguese coast, especially in Algarve, Sines, Madeira Island and in the marinas of Horta and Ponta Delgada (Azores). This sampling strategy was meant to provide ecological information on native and invasive species, on the role of ships in the introduction of the latter and to posteriorly presume their environmental impact in the native assemblages. The recognition of the taxa with potential of being transported by boats was considered in the molecular phylogenetic inferences presented in chapters 5 to 9 of this Ph.D. dissertation.\nAn extensive collection of hydroids from bathyal depths of the Gulf of Cadiz, collected during 14 oceanographic campaigns, was studied in great detail. One of these oceanographic campaigns (TTR17) also collected hydroids from bathyal depths of the Alboran Sea, which were also included in taxonomic and molecular studies. A wide range of sampling devices was used to collect hydroids in these oceanographic campaigns; these included: Tv-grabs, remoted operated vehicles (ROVs), box-cores and dredges.\nRepresentative collections of hydroid specimens essentially from deep waters of the Azores and Madeira, principally sampled as part of by-catch studies, were also investigated. That biological material was borrowed for the completion of this thesis aims, respectively, from the Department of Fisheries and Oceanography - University of the Azores, and the Municipal Museum of Funchal - Biological Station of Funchal, Madeira. The fishing devices used to collect these hydroids included \u2018long lines with multiple hooks' (in Portuguese: \u2018palangre de fundo', \u2018gorazeira', \u2018trole' and \u2018espinhel') and \u2018fish\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\ntraps' (in Portuguese: \u2018covos'). The \u2018CoralFish' project also provided specimens sampled by submersible from the Pico-Faial channel (Azores).\n3.2\tLIST OF THE STATIONS AND SPECIES STUDIED\n3.2.1\tPORTUGAL (main land)\n3.2.1.1\tCoastal waters\nSouthern coast\nAlbufeira: marina, 37\u00b005.019'N 8\u00b015.903'W, 0-0,5 m, dock; 28 March 2007.\nSertulariidae undet..\nAlvor beach: 37\u00b007.000'N 8\u00b035.000'W, ca. 10 m, scuba diving, rocky seafloor; 14 July 2007.\nLafoeina tenuis Sars, 1874, - Cuspidella sp., - Dynamena disticha (Bosc, 1802), -Kirchenpaueria pinnata (Linnaeus, 1758), - Antennella secundaria (Gmelin, 1791), - Aglaopheniapluma (Linnaeus, 1758).\nAlbufeira: Olhos d'Agua beach, 37\u00b005.319'N 8\u00b011.452'W, 2-3 m, scuba diving, rocky seafloor; 23 July 2007.\nModeeria rotunda (Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1827), - Lafoeina tenuis Sars, 1874, -Scandia gigas (Pieper, 1828), - Sertularella mediterranea Hartlaub, 1901, - Salacia desmoides (Torrey, 1902), - Kirchenpaueria pinnata (Linnaeus, 1758), -Kirchenpaueria similis (Hincks, 1861), - Aglaopheniapluma (Linnaeus, 1758).\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nCarvoeiro: Hotel Tivoli beach, Lagoa, 1-8 m, snorkling, rocky wall of northern side of islet; March 2007.\nSertularella lagenoides Stechow, 1919, - Aglaopheniapluma (Linnaeus, 1758).\nCarvoeiro: Lagoa, 37\u00b005.419'N 8O27.269\u2019W, 1-8 m, scuba diving, rocky wall; 21 July 2007.\nLafoeina tenuis Sars, 1874, - Scandia cf. gigas (Pieper, 1828), - Salacia desmoides (Torrey, 1902), - Kirchenpaueria similis (Hincks, 1861), - Halopteris diaphana (Heller, 1868), - Plumularia setacea (Linnaeus, 1758), - Aglaophenia pluma (Linnaeus, 1758).\nLagos: Ponta da Piedade, 37\u00b004.753'N 8\u00b040.088'W, 1-8 m, scuba diving, rocky wall; 24 July 2007.\nPhialella quadrata (Forbes, 1848), - cf.

The escarpment changes from the NW-SE direction to almost N-S, it is around 100 m high, the water depth at the top is 525 m. At the top of the escarpment, a platform with irregular backscatter pattern occurs. The eastern part platform is characterized by a hummocky topography. To the west the pattern changes to parallel elongated ridges. Gullies occur at the base of the escarpment. The coral banks consist of dead coral framework with terrigeneous mud matrix and few living corals at the top. It is indicative of a more favourable coral habitat in the past, perhaps related to strong currents in this area. The carbonate slabs consists of carbonate cement with shells, corals and other debris, which might indicate present or past expulsion of hydrocarbon gases, probably along a fault zone. Fault zone with carbonate slabs.\nRecent studies on the Pen Duick escarpment revealed that cold water corals can colonise fields of mud breccia and form large build-ups associated with mud volcanoes.\nStn AT-406-Gr: TTR12, 35\u00b018.148'N 06\u00b047.666'W, 550 m, TV-assisted grab, dead coral bank escarpment; 15 July 2002.\nLafoeina tenuis G.O.

This taxonomic survey presents 20 new records of hydroid species for the Gorringe Bank which is known to contain a total of 38 hydroid species. Eudendrium armatum and Eudendrium cf. merulum were supposedly restricted to the Mediterranean and were now found in the Gorringe. The Gorringe seems highly connected zoogeographically with the Mediterranean and neighbouring continental coasts, in terms of hydrozoan fauna. The large densities of algae at the peaks of the seamounts sustain a considerable hydrozoan diversity (23 species). Conversely, algae may also inhibit the direct attachment of hydroid species to the rocky substrata. All the hydrozoan species known from the peaks of the Gorringe were collected during summer only, and therefore sampling in other seasons, despite being\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nsomewhat adventurous by scuba diving, may reveal further hydrozoan diversity due to seasonal patterns of growth of algae and hydroids. Nevertheless, the reasonably high levels of hydrozoan biodiversity demonstrated only from the summits of the Gorringe, is further indication of this seamount as a \u2018biodiversity hotspot'.\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\nSeamounts are prominent undersea mountains usually associated with volcanic activity (e.g. Epp &amp; Smoot 1989; Rogers 1994). Seamounts are known as \u2018underwater oases' because compared to surrounding environments, they host richer communities of seabed organisms (e.g. corals, sponges), as well as aggregations of fishes (e.g. Rogers 1994; Koslow 1997; Koslow 2000; Stocks 2004). The high establishment of biodiversity in seamounts is mainly due to the availability of hard-substrata and interaction of seamounts with oceanic currents that tend to increase water-flow velocities around these geologic structures, giving rise to hydrographic phenomena like upwellings, turbulence, Taylor cones and eddies (e.g. Eriksen 1991; Kunze &amp; Stanford 1993; Rogers 1994; Koslow et al. 2001; Coelho &amp; Santos 2003).\nThere is an estimation of up to 100,000 seamounts in the world's oceans rising from the seabed more than 1 Km (Wessel 2001). Although only a very small fraction of these structures have been properly sampled and studied in terms of biodiversity (Stocks 2009), despite their well-recognized importance in terms of marine life (e.g. Rogers 1994).\nThe Gorringe Bank is located at about 125-150 miles WSW off the Cape St. Vincent in SW Portugal. It covers an area of over 180 Km long, that rises from depths of over 5000 m up to depths of about 35 m in its two major peaks: the Gettysburg (36\u00b031'N, 11\u00b034'W) and Ormonde (38\u00b042'N, 11\u00b009'W). The seamounts Gettysburg and Ormonde are set apart by about 30 miles. (Oceana 2005; Tourais 2008; Fig. 4.1)\nThe Gorringe Bank is included in a ridge with other seamounts oriented in a NE-SW direction, covering an area of about 9500 Km (Oceana 2005). The Gorringe Bank is assumed to be one of the oldest Atlantic seamounts (Conti et al. 2004). It is located in an area of conjunction of the African and Euro-Asiatic tectonic plates, and is sometimes\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\nassociated with geological seismicity (e.g. Purdy 1975; Moreira 1985). The Gorringe is influenced by several important major currents that converge in or nearby the seamounts (e.g. the Gulf, Antarctic, African and Mediterranean currents) being therefore a site potentially enriched with nutrients and consequently of fauna and algae (e.g. Oceana 2005).\nFig. 4.1. Map with the location of the Gorringe Bank.\nDespite the topographic prominence of the Gorringe Bank, its relative proximity to shore and recognizable importance as biodiversity \u2018hotspot\u2019 with need for protection as marine protected area (WWF 2001; Oceana 2005; Oceana 2011), the Gorringe has only been subject to few biological studies in recent years (Ramil et al. 1998; \u00c1vila &amp; Malaquias 2003; Dijkstra &amp; Gofas 2004; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2004; Oceana 2005; Xavier &amp; van Soest 2007; Abecasis et al. 2009).\nThe hydrozoan fauna of the Gorringe Bank is little studied, only with records of some deep-sea hydroids (Ramil et al. 1998) and very few shallow-water taxa (Oceana 2005). The latter study probably did not include a taxonomic revision by a hydrozoan specialist.\nThe aim of the present study was to identify the shallow-water hydrozoan fauna of the peaks of Gorringe Bank (Gettysburg and Ormonde) collected by SCUBA diving during the \u2018LusoExpedi\u00e7\u00e3o Olympus 2008\u2019 between the 8th and 13 th July 2008 onboard of the NT \u2018Creoula\u2019. This study may also contribute to further arguments for the implementation of a marine reserve at the Gorringe Bank area (WWF 2001; Oceana 2005; Oceana 2011).\nPh.D. thesis: Carlos Moura\nSystematics and evolution of Hydrozoa from the NE Atlantic\n8.2\tLIST OF STATIONS\nStn 1: Ormonde peak, 10 June 2008, 16:00h, collector: C.

The hydroid samples were collected by scuba diving from the Ormonde and Gettysburg seamount peaks at depths between 35 and 42 m. Only few records of hydroids from the Gorringe existed (Ramil et al. 1998; Oceana 2005).\nThe 28 hydroid species herein revealed were identified amongst the biological material collected during the \u2018LusoExpedigao Olympus 2008'. 22 of these species represent new records for the Gorringe Bank (Table 4.1). The total of hydroid species now known at the Gorringe seamounts ascends to 38 (Table 4.1). The present work consequently contributes to an increase of over 130% of new records of hydroid species for the Gorringe; and only the summits of the seamounts were sampled.\nThe relationship between the shallow waters of the Mediterranean and the Gorringe was evident by the presence of Eudendrium armatum and E. cf. merulum in the Gorringe, outside the Mediterranean. Additionally, apart from the taxa with uncertain identity, all the other species herein recorded are also present in the Mediterranean.\nEudendrium ramosum and the two and three species of Aglaophenia and Sertularella respectively, have geographical ranges limited to the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Table 4.1). The other 11 hydrozoan taxa identified nominally to the species level present (supposedly) much larger distributions (see Table 4.1).\nThe majority of the hydroid specimens collected specifically for this study were found as epibiont of algae and/or of other hydroids. Only two hydroid species (Eudendrium armatum and Sertularella gayi) were found directly attached to rock. The extremely high density of algae populating the summits of the Gorringe Bank (Oceana 2005; Moura, pers. observation) visibly inhibits the establishment of hydroids directly over the rocky substrate. E. armatum and S. gayi were found in relatively high abundances on solid substrata, but only on vertical walls with limited exposure to sunlight and consequently fewer algae. On the other hand, the high abundance and diversity of algae on the Gorringe peaks facilitated the direct establishment of 23 hydroid species.\nThe abundance of algae on the peaks of the Gorringe may decrease in winter especially due to more limited sunlight exposure, and other hydroid species (not reported yet for the seamount) could be also present on the summits of the Gorringe outside summer\n- e.g. see the evidence of high levels of seasonality of benthic hydroids (and algae) in a Mediterranean location by Boero &amp; Fresi (1986) and Bavestrello et al. (2006).\nCoryne eximia was found just once (but extremely abundant) over a cable that had been lost in the Gorringe two years before the hydroid sampling. C. eximia can be found at the low water mark and overgrowing floating objects like buoys and rafts (Schuchert 2001), and therefore this species might have been transported unintentionally by humans to the Gorringe.\nThe majority of the hydroids collected during the \u2018LusoExpedigao Olympus 2008' (75% of the species with life cycle pattern known), have the medusoid stage suppressed from the life-cycle and therefore their mode of dispersal is practically limited to short-lived planulae and rafting. As so, the most probable explanation for the presence of these hydroids in the Gorringe is precisely by rafting on algae; taking into account the distance of the Gorringe to the coast, the absence of these hydrozoan species in deeper waters (exception for S. gayi), and their direct or indirect occurrence over algae. The five Campanulariidae hydroid species recorded liberate medusae or medusoids, are cosmopolitan and abundant, and therefore might have also arrived in the Gorringe directly through oceanic currents. Sertularella gayi does not liberate medusae or medusoids and was not detected overgrowing algae; but the effective presence of this nominal species both in shallow and deep waters (Moura et al. 2011a), does not exclude the possibility that this species may have reached the peaks of the seamount from deeper waters.\nIn conclusion, this study: (1) revealed relatively high specific richness of hydroids only from the summits of the Gorringe Bank sampled; (2) confirmed that the Gorringe is a \u2018biodiversity hotspot' still with many unreported species; (3) highlighted that most of the hydrozoan biodiversity found are phylogeographically associated with the Mediterranean and close continental shores of the eastern Atlantic; (4) discussed the probable vagility of the hydroids found in the Gorringe; (5) provided further arguments to protect the Gorringe as a marine protected area.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research would have not been possible without the invitation of Universidade Lus\u00f3fona (Portugal) to CJM participate in the \u2018LusoExpedigao Olympus 2008'. I acknowledge in particular prof. Pinto de Abreu and Gongalo Calado, M\u00f3nica Albuquerque, Jos\u00e9 Tourais and his technical diving team, my diving colleagues and those who collected me hydroids: Jos\u00e9 Pedro Borges, Joana Xavier and Pedro Neves. All the crew of NTM \u2018Creoula\u2019 and the other participates of this fabulous research expedition were fantastic. Estibaliz Berecibar aided the identification of the two species of algae herein mentioned. Peter Shuchert kindly resolved the taxonomy of a few taxa and shared unpublished 16S genetic data with CJM. Alex Rogers and Ferdinando Boero corrected and commented, respectively, an earlier version of the manuscript. Carlos J.

When combined and analysed with 68 additional sequences published in GenBank, corresponding to 63 nominal species of these families (nine species in common between the GenBank sequences and those presented by the authors), cryptic species were detected (e.g. two species of Nemertesia and another of Lafoea), as well as apparent cases of conspecificity (e.g. Nemertesia\nantennina and N. perrieri and Aglaophenia octodonta, A. pluma and A. tubiformis). Other taxonomic inconsistencies were found in the data including cases where species from different genera clustered together (e.g. Sertularia cupressina, Thuiaria thuja, Abietinaria abietina and Ab. filicula). The mitochondrial 16S rRNA proved to be a useful DNA \u2018barcode\u2019 gene for hydroids, not only allowing discrimination of species, but also in some cases of populations, genera and families, and their intra- or interphylogenetic associations. Although still under-represented in public data bases, the 16S rRNA gene is starting to be used frequently in the study of hydroids. These data provide powerful complementary evidence for advancing our understanding of hydrozoan systematics.\n5.1\tINTRODUCTION\nThe oceans are the cradle of life on Earth and they harbour a higher diversity at upper taxonomic levels (phylum, class, orders), than terrestrial or freshwater ecosystems. Out of ca. 46 phyla of animals: 35 are found in the oceans, 14 of which are exclusively marine and several others are mainly marine (e.g. Cnidaria; Sala &amp; Knowlton 2006). However, the opposite appears true at the species level with ca. 1.5 million species having been described from terrestrial environments but only about 300 000 from marine ecosystems (Reaka-Kudla 1997). This partially results from the high diversity of terrestrial arthropods but may also reflect the large, open-nature of marine ecosystems, resulting in large geographical distributions of populations and species and lower rates of allopatric speciation over geological time scales. This is thought to have resulted in near cosmopolitan distributions of many species, with perhaps the most striking examples being among the hydroids (Stepanyants 1980; Cornelius 1995a,b).\nHydroids or Hydrozoa were classified under the Vermes (invertebrates) as Zoophyta (plant-animals) by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th Edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. Hydroids consist of polyps which primitively have a central mouth surrounded by tentacles armed with nematocysts. These polyps can occur as solitary individuals in some species but in most usually occur as colonies where each is joined by a tube of tissue and the whole is protected by a rigid exoskeleton, the perisarc (Cornelius 1995a,b). Almost all\ncolonies are fixed to the seabed (sessile) and have a variety of forms from root-like stolons to erect tree-like structures that can be conspicuous amongst the emergent epifauna of coastal and deep-sea ecosystems. Many common hydroids from the coastal waters of Europe were described originally by Linnaeus and, as with many species in the region, have subsequently been recorded as having a near cosmopolitan distribution (Cornelius 1995a,b, e.g. Obelia geniculata (Linnaeus, 1758); Plumularia setacea (Linnaeus, 1758); Amphisbetia operculata (Linnaeus, 1758)). In some cases, the widespread distribution of hydroids may result from a dispersive life-history. Some forms (e.g. O. geniculata) have a reproductive pelagic medusoid stage which releases gametes that undergo external fertilization producing a pelagic planula stage. In other cases (e.g. most of the Plumulariidae) the medusoid stage is reduced, effectively being retained by the hydroid colony and fertilization is external with most species being dioecious (colonies that have separate sexes). The resultant planula larvae swim or crawl away and are generally shortlived, although those of some species may take up to several days to settle and metamorphose. Many hydroids have the ability to raft on natural substrata, such as kelp holdfasts (hydrochory, e.g. Cornelius 1992, 1995a,b), and many can grow on artificial surfaces, often being a significant element of marine fouling communities (e.g. Lewbel et al. 1987; Relini et al. 1998; Yan et al. 2006) so passive dispersal on natural and anthropogenic materials is likely for many species.\nThe hydroids are anatomically simple animals with few morphological characters, great phenotypic plasticity and many shared characters that represent homoplasies. There are about 3700 described species (Bouillon et al. 2006) but the taxonomy of the group is problematic and the potential for morphologically cryptic taxa is high (e.g. Govindarajan et al. 2005a; Schuchert 2005a). Often identification of species can only be accomplished at a particular life-stage or when reproductive structures are present. Furthermore, taxonomic expertise in the group is diminishing and existing taxonomists tend to focus their studies only on particular life-stages and/or taxonomic groups. This \u2018taxonomic impediment' makes resolution of species difficult for many hydroids and the perceived widespread cosmopolitanism of the group may be erroneous. A similar situation exists for many groups of marine invertebrates and coupled with the very poor sampling of marine habitats (e.g. in the deep sea) may have led to a significant underestimation of the global diversity of metazoans in the world's oceans.\nNucleotide sequence data have been applied successfully to the study of phylogenetic relationships between taxa because of the work of Woese &amp; Fox (1977) on bacteria. However, the idea of large-scale screening of standardized short genetic markers (DNA \u2018barcodes'), to rapidly assign unknown individuals, life-history stages and forensic or subfossil material to known species or even populations or to aid the discovery of cryptic biodiversity, was first proposed by Floyd et al. (2002) and Hebert et al. (2003a,b). To date, DNA barcoding projects have been broadly tested on known taxa, and have tended to successfully identify > 95% of target species (Hebert et al. 2004a,b; Hebert &amp; Gregory 2005; Ward et al. 2005; Clare et al. 2006; Cywinska et al. 2006; Hajibabaei et al. 2006). Studies have also indicated the potential of barcoding genes to identify putative cryptic taxa indicating the power of this approach in species discovery (Monaghan et al. 2005; Barber &amp; Boyce 2006; Clare et al. 2006; Hajibabaei et al. 2006; Witt et al. 2006; Gomez et al. 2007; Kerr et al. 2007). These studies have all focused on ca. 650 base pairs of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene as the main barcoding gene for metazoans. This is because COI is easily amplified from diverse taxa using broad-range primers under variable laboratory conditions and protocols (Folmer et al. 1994; Hebert et al. 2003a,b; Ivanova et al. 2007; Kerr et al. 2007). It is also readily aligned for sequence comparisons, and is sufficiently divergent to discriminate species effectively across a variety of phyla, with the result that a lot of data from this gene has already been accumulated in publicly accessible data bases (Hebert et al. 2004a,b). Presently, over 200 000 DNA \u2018barcodes' corresponding to more than 26 000 species (www.barcodinglife.org) are already gathered. However, other genes have also been used as a basis for barcoding or for species discovery (e.g. Markmann &amp; Tautz 2005; Mathews 2006), especially where COI does not amplify reliably for the taxon under study (Cook et al. 2005; Bhadury et al. 2006), has failed to resolve species as a result of slow evolution of the mitochondrial genome (e.g. Cnidaria; Porifera; France et al. 1996; van Oppen et al. 1999; Shearer et al. 2002; citing R. Watkins, pers. comm.; Duran et al. 2004; Hellberg 2006; Worheide 2006), or where divergent COI sequences have been found within species (Vences et al. 2005).\nDNA barcoding, especially when used for species discovery, remains contentious, especially amongst taxonomists (Moritz &amp; Cicero 2004; DeSalle et al. 2005; Ebach &amp; Holdrege 2005; Brower 2006). Drawbacks identified with DNA barcoding approaches, have centred around the resolution of intra- and interspecific variation in DNA sequences\n(Hewitt 1996; Avise &amp; Johns 1999; Hebert et al. 2003b; Moritz &amp; Cicero 2004; Meyer &amp; Paulay 2005) including problems associated with inherited symbionts (Hurst &amp; Jiggins 2005), with introgression/ hybridization (e.g. Masta et al. 2002; Babik et al. 2005) or with very recent speciation (e.g. Johnson &amp; Cicero 2004); the reliance on single-gene trees (DeSalle et al. 2005); the lack of comprehensive sampling of species of the taxa under study (Moritz &amp; Cicero 2004; DeSalle et al. 2005); and failure to sample voucher specimens or to take account of existing taxonomic knowledge. Whilst these criticisms are valid, the linking of DNA sequence data with other information, such as geographical, ecological, biological or morphological data can provide a powerful way to break out of the tautological or circular reasoning that lies behind an oversimplified application of barcoding, especially when identifying new taxa (DeSalle et al. 2005). Examples of this include the identification of covariation between morphology and barcode sequence clusters in South American Lepidoptera (Hajibabaei et al. 2006) and the use of mating trials to confirm that deep genetic lineages within the bryozoan Celleporella hyalina are reproductively isolated (Gomez et al. 2007). Thus, DNA barcoding or DNA taxonomy can be a modern complement to the classification of the most important unit of biodiversity, the species, testing and making systematics more practical, rigorous and complete.\nThe orthologous barcoding gene, COI, has rarely been used and studied in the hydroids (Shearer et al. 2002; Govindarajan et al. 2005a, 2006). This is because studies have suggested that it evolves at a slow rate (Shearer et al. 2002), although in some cases the gene has been revealed as phylogenetically informative (see Govindarajan et al. 2005a for O. geniculata). Instead the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene has been preferentially used to resolve phylogenetic problems from the subfamily to population levels (e.g. Bridge et al. 1995; Schierwater &amp; Ender 2000; Collins et al. 2005; Govindarajan et al. 2005a,b, 2006; Schuchert 2005a,b; Fraser et al. 2006; Schuchert &amp; Reiswig 2006; Galea &amp; Lecrere 2007; Hemmrich et al. 2007; Leclere et al. 2007; Moura et al. 2007); whereas the nuclear 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA genes have been used for evolutionary studies at higher taxonomical levels (Bridge et al. 1995; Collins 2000; Collins et al. 2006; Govindarajan et al. 2006).\nThe present study evaluates the potential of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene as a tool for DNA barcoding of hydroid species. It also evaluates the systematic resolution of the mt 16S rRNA above the species level for addressing phylogenetic questions within the Class (e.g. in the Plumularioidea). The data obtained are also used to test whether hydroid\nspecies are widespread in geographical distribution or whether they are in fact complexes of cryptic taxa segregated by depth, geographical barriers (e.g. continents) or distance.\n5.2\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\nHydroids collected from bathyal environments of the Gulf of Cadiz, Azores and Greenland, and shallow waters of the southwest of England and south of Portugal (Table 5.1) were identified and the total DNA was extracted (DNeasy Kit, Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, West Sussex, UK). Whenever possible, the skeletons of the colonies were mounted in permanent slides and deposited, in conjunction with their original sample, in the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro, Portugal. The primers SHA (ACGGAATGAACTCAAATCATGT) and SHB (TCGACTGTTTACCAAAAACATA) (Cunningham &amp; Buss 1993) were used to amplify ca. 600 base pairs of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. A 50 gL of PCR reaction contained 30.5-35.5 gL of ultrapure water, 5 gL of 10x PCR buffer, 4 gL of MgCl2 (25 mM), 4 gL of dNTPs (10 mM), 2 gL of each primer (10 pM/gL) and 1-5 gL of DNA template (all reagents Qiagen apart from water which was from the Sigma Chemical Company). The thermal cycle parameters of the PCR reaction consisted of one cycle of 5 min 94 \u00b0C; 35 cycles of 1 min 94 \u00b0C, 1 min 48-50 \u00b0C and 1.5 min 72 \u00b0C and a final cycle of 5 min 72 \u00b0C. After purification of the PCR product (Qiaquick, Qiagen), the same primers were used to sequence both strands using the ABI BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 kit. Sequencing reactions were purified using a Dye-Ex v. 2 Spin Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Purified sequencing reactions were dried using a vacuum centrifuge and then resuspended in 10 gL of formamide and heated for 3 min at 96 \u00b0C and cooled for 3 min on ice prior to sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 3100 Prism DNA Analyser.\nBoth strands of corresponding sequences were aligned in BIOEDIT using CLUSTALW with default alignment parameters, and then corrected by eye to produce a consensus sequence. Sixty-eight additional 16S sequences of hydroids were obtained from GenBank to complement the analysis for the six families of Hydrozoa treated in the present study. These sequences were analysed together in a single data set with Tubiclavoides\nstriatum as the outgroup, and in separate data sets for each family using one or two haplotypes of a different (but closely related) family as outgroups. For each data set sequences were aligned in MEGA 3.1 (Kumar et al. 2004) with CLUSTALW using the default alignment settings, and trimmed to the shortest sequence. Positions with gaps were removed from the alignment of the data set containing all sequences of all the represented families. For the other data sets, the full-length of gene was used. The program MODELTEST 3.7 (Posada &amp; Crandall 1998) was used to determine the optimal probabilistic model of sequence evolution by using the Akaike Information Criterion for each alignment. \u2018Maximum-likelihood\u2019 phylogenetic analyses were performed, for each data set, through the PHYML website (http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml) (Guindon et al. 2005) using default parameters except for the model of nucleotide substitution, which was specified as GTR. This was the closest model available to those selected by MODELTEST (GTR + I + G with the exception of the data sets of Lafoeidae and Eudendriidae, where GTR + G was selected). A \u2018bioneighbor-joining\u2019 starting tree was also estimated using the PHYML website. PAUP 4.1 (Swofford 1998) was used to determine pairwise uncorrected sequence differences (\u2018P\u2019 distances) within the data sets of each family, for simple comparisons of percentage sequence divergence within species, within genera and between genera.\n5.3\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA total of 56 sequences of the 16S RNA gene, of 580 nucleotides in length, corresponding to 43 distinct genotypes of 35 nominal and 36 phylogenetically distinct species of hydroids were determined for the present analysis. Of these, 24 distinct haplotypes represent hydroids from bathyal environments of the Gulf of Cadiz (22), Greenland (1), and the Azores (1), and 19 from shallow waters of the United Kingdom (17) and Portugal (2). The new sequences herein presented were complemented with 68 more taken from the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), corresponding to an additional 63 nominal species, nine of which were also identified among the authors\u2019 samples.\nAmplification of 16S sequences was impeded by DNA deterioration in many colonies, as a result of preservation in 70% ethanol and/or the excessive exposure of the biological material to air and/or sun prior to fixation. It is notable that material that was rapidly preserved in 96% ethanol following the collection from the bathyal environment of the Gulf of Cadiz, gave a markedly greater rate of successful amplification and sequencing.\nThe alignment of all the 16S sequences (Table 5.1) revealed a high number of insertion/deletions (indels) making alignment of the sequences difficult and potentially ambiguous. Where taxonomic sampling is broad, fewer characters of ribosomal genes are likely to be homologous, justifying the choice to consider a smaller number of base pairs. Comparison of nodal supports of the trees with indels included and those with indels excluded indicated that bootstrap indices, especially of clades representing families and genera, tended to be higher in the latter. It was therefore necessary to exclude all positions in the alignment containing gaps, in order to provide a more reliable alignment and phylogenetic analysis. However, the removal of these characters from sequences potentially reduced the resolution of diversity at the population and species level. For example, indel regions proved to be useful in detecting specific populations of species (e.g. Aglaophenia). Therefore, analyses for each family were carried out separately on fulllength sequences containing the whole gene.\nTubiclavoides striatum (family Tubiclavoididae) was used as outgroup for the analysis containing all the 124 16S sequences herein analysed. This was because the closest related taxon to this is the Eudendriidae, as both families belong to the Order Anthoathecata and Suborder Filifera. This follows the suggestion that outgroups should be monophyletic with the ingroup in a wider phylogenetic context (e.g. Donoghue &amp; Cantino 1984; Smith 1994). The 16S sequence of T. striatum also does not have many insertions compared to the other taxa analysed, simplifying the alignment. However, the support for the hypothesized relationship between T. striatum and the Eudendriidae was weak in the current analysis (Fig. 5.1). All the other five families herein examined (Haleciidae, Lafoeidae, Sertulariidae, Aglaopheniidae and Plumulariidae) belong to the putatively monophyletic order Leptothecata, which is a sister group to the Anthoathecata. The use of the Siphonophorae or even Trachylina as outgroups is unlikely to be useful as these taxa are highly divergent to those in the present analysis giving a high probability that changes in nucleotide sequences are effectively random as a result of multiple substitutions at\nhomologous sites (Wheeler 1990; Smith 1994). For the phylogenetic analyses of the families separately, outgroups were selected from branches close to the family identified in the overall phylogenetic tree.\nHigh-level phylogenetic analysis\nThe inferred tree of the data set containing all the 124 distinct 16S sequences, with 368 bp (indels excluded), is essentially concordant with the other trees recovered for each of the seven families characterized, especially where nodes are well-supported (Fig. 5.1). It comprises a distinctive well characterized congruent monophyletic clade representing the Plumularioidea; and a less-resolved/supported group of clades containing the haplotypes of the other families. It is notable that regions of DNA used for barcoding often give poor information at higher taxonomic levels because the rate of evolution that renders them suitable for differentiating species is too high for resolving higher phylogeny (Moritz &amp; Cicero 2004). However, the topology of even the poorly resolved part of the tree supports the monophyly of the Eudendriidae, and suggests that the Lafoeidae comprises two distinct clades, the Haleciidae is subdivided into weakly associated clades, and all but one species (Symplectoscyphus tricuspidatus) of Sertulariidae are monophyletic (Fig. 5.1). Regarding the monophyletic superfamily Plumularioidea, high bootstrap values in the analysis for this particular group corroborate the subdivision of this superfamily into the monophyletic families Aglaopheniidae and Plumulariidae, with the remainder subdivided into the subfamilies Halopteriinae, Kirchenpaueriinae and Plumulariinae, as proposed by Cornelius (1995a,b). The prominence of the Plumularioidea clade in the tree when compared to the other thecate and athecate families analysed suggest a faster rate of evolution of the 16S gene in this superfamily (also noted by Leclere et al. 2007).

Phylogenetic analysis of the data set containing the 16S sequences of the family Plumulariidae. (A) \u2018Maximum-likelihood\u2019 tree for 500 pseudoreplicates. Aglaophenia tubiformis and A. picardi are the outgroup taxa. Numbers near the nodes indicate the percent bootstrap values. The branch length indicator represents 0.1 substitutions per site. (B) Graphic of the 16 S sequence divergences as uncorrected P-values (%): within species, within genera and between genera. Abbreviation: n, indicates the number of taxa with two or more haplotypes at those taxonomic levels.\nPlumulariinae (Fig. 5.2A). The sequence divergence between species of genera from these taxonomic ranks reaches 26%, 25.4% and 19.4%, respectively. This suggests a rapid evolution of the 16S gene within these groups. The Plumulariidae is resolved as a well-supported monophyletic group with two main sister clades: the well-supported monophyletic subfamily Plumulariinae, and another clade with less bootstrap support containing the subfamilies Halopteriinae and Kirchenpaueriinae (Fig. 5.2A). In general the obtained topology of trees and results are in accordance to those obtained by Leclere et al. (2007).\nThe subfamily Halopteriinae is monophyletic with strong bootstrap support, comprising species with a high interspecific 16S sequence divergence (Fig. 5.2B). It is notable that Polyplumaria flabellata clusters within the Halopteriinae instead of inside the Plumulariinae, as has been proposed by some authors (Fig. 5.2A). In evolutionary terms P. flabellata is the closest species to the common ancestor of this subfamily. It groups with Halopteris minuta, H. tenella, H. diaphana in a different clade to that containing other species of Halopteris and the genera Antenella and Monostaechas (Fig. 5.2A). This last clade comprises very divergent species, the relationships between which are not resolved by means of 16S data. It is therefore not possible to confirm the validity or monophyly of the genera Antenella and Monostaechas and the haplotype data remains insufficient to clarify the phylogenetic relations within this subfamily.\nThe subfamily Kirchenpaueriinae is represented by only four nominal species of three genera, and appears monophyletic, though without high bootstrap support (Fig. 5.2A). The extremely high sequence divergence in this subfamily between Ventromma halecioides and the other Kirchenpauerinae species represented (ca. 25%) is notable. Also there is almost no variation in 16S sequences between the haplotypes of Kirchenpaueria similis and K. pinnata (Fig. 5.2B). If this is not a result of contamination or misidentification, it is likely that these two latter species are conspecific. Again, more haplotype data from representatives of this subfamily are required for a better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of its member taxa.\nThe subfamily Plumulariinae is recovered as a well supported monophyletic group (Fig. 5.2A). The genera Nemertesia and Dentitheca appear monophyletic; Plumularia and Monotheca are polyphyletic. Plumularia lagenifera, Pl. strictocarpa and Pl. setacea group closely, and the haplotypes of the former species represented in the analyses reflect genetic\npopulation subdivision, with higher genetic divergences observed between the Pacific and Atlantic individuals.\nThe genus Nemertesia is recovered as monophyletic but the systematic relationships between its species are not fully resolved on the basis of 16S haplotype data (Fig. 5.2A). Nevertheless, more than five distinct Nemertesia species are recovered: Nemertesia norvegica, N. antennina (from shallow waters), N. ventriculiformis, N. ramosa and a species complex within N. antennina (from deep waters). Nemertesia antennina is a conspicuous species considered to be distributed in boreal, temperate and subtropical Atlantic waters, from the low water mark to about 2300 m depth. It has also been reported from localities in the Indian Ocean, on coast of South Africa and from Japan (Ansin Agis et al. 2001). One haplotypic group of N. antennina from Roscoff, France, and Plymouth and Lundy Island, UK, corresponds to colonies presenting the diagnostic morphological features of the species (i.e. with one nematotheca per athecate internode). Nemertesia perrieri that differs from N. antennina by the constant presence of two nematothecae per athecate internode (or two consecutive athecate internodes with one nematothecae) (Ansin Agis et al. 2001), appears to be conspecific to N. antennina from shallow waters based on 16S gene data (Fig. 5.2B). It thus confirms that the morphology of N. antennina from shallow waters can vary. However, the specimens of \u2018N. antennina\" collected from deep waters of the Gulf of Cadiz, which is a geographical area between the Mediterranean, English and French Atlantic coasts, form a very distant clade to that of N. antennina and N. perrieri from shallow-waters (Fig. 5.2A,B). From this evidence it seems that the nominal species N. antennina corresponds in fact to a complex of species segregated by depth. Additionally, the deep-water group of \u2018N. antennina\" in turn seems to be segregated into two distinct haplotypes representing species (or populations). These new species are morphologically distinct from N. antennina and N. perrieri and will be described and discussed in a forthcoming publication. Thus the socalled taxonomic circle will be closed following the revelation from 16S of at least two cryptic species of Nemertesia in the NE Atlantic. The occurrence of cryptic species living at different depths on the continental shelf/slope or in the water column has been observed for many taxa including echinoderms, crustaceans and molluscs (e.g. France &amp; Kocher 1996; Howell et al. 2004; Zardus et al. 2006) and reinforces the perception of bathyal species having narrow depth ranges (e.g. Howell et al. 2002). This suggests that depth or physical factors correlated\nwith depth have an important influence on speciation in some major groups of marine organisms.\nFamily Aglaopheniidae\nThis family is resolved as monophyletic with strong bootstrap support. The genus Gymnangium, represented by a well supported clade containing G. montagui and G. hians, is the sister group of a clade containing the genera Cladocarpus, Lytocarpia, Aglaophenia and Macrorhynchia (Fig. 5.3A). Cladocarpus is sister to the other three genera and Lytocarpia and Macrorhynchia are sister groups to a monophyletic clade containing nine nominal species of Aglaophenia. Gymnangium gracilicaule clusters with strong support (Fig. 1) within the genus Macrorhynchia, suggesting that that species should be moved to Macrorhynchia (see also Fig. 5.3B). The genus Aglaophenia is recovered as monophyletic, but the phylogenetic relationships between its species are not well-resolved. Three different haplotypes of A. lophocarpa occur on the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz, despite the species practically having no morphological variation. The intraspecific genetic differences between these specimens of A. lophocarpa sampled in proximate localities, although within the normal range, can be twice as great as those of between specimens of A. tubulifera from shallow waters of England and bathyal depths of the Gulf of Cadiz. Although based on few haplotype data that are insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the intraspecific variation of these taxa, it may suggest genetically effective dispersal between these shallow and deep localities for A. tubulifera, possibly via the influence of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW). The MOW flows through the Gulf of Cadiz and part of it flows north along the continental slope off Portugal, France and the Celtic Sea (e.g. McCartney &amp; Mauritzen 2001; Hernandez-Molina et al. 2006; White 2007). Aglaophenia tubiformis, A. octodonta and A. pluma show extremely low levels of 16S sequence divergence and genetic distances are more consistent with intraspecific comparisons in the group than interspecific (Fig. 5.3B). Comparison of the morphologies of A. tubiformis, A. octodonta and A. pluma, show that these \u2018species\u2019 are very similar. Phenotypic characters including shape or inclination of hydrothecal cusps, colour of structures and presence of zooxanthellae are the only diagnostic features separating these three species (Bouillon et al. 2004). Molecular data thus strongly suggests that these\n\u2018diagnostic\u2019 features probably represent environmentally driven plasticity or different populations/varieties within a single species, with the name A. pluma, having priority.\n~Plumularia setacea Roscoff - France \u2014Nemertesia antennina Plymouth - U.K.\n\u2014Cladocarpus paraformosus Greenland\n------Lytocarpia phyteuma Andaman Sea - Thailand I\u2014Aglaophenia latecarinata San Sebastian - Brazil 89 r-Aglaopheniaparvula False Bay - South Africa -Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri Lundi Island - U.K. Aglaophenia octodonta Villefranche-sur-Mer - France Aglaophenia pluma Villefranche-sur-Mer - France Aglaophenia tubiformis Banuyls-sur-Mer, Roscoff - France Aglaophenia octodonta Carvoeiro - Portugal Aglaophenia tubiformis Lundi Island - U.K.\n(A)\n91\n00\n100\n0.1\n98 \u201dAglaophenia picardi Roscoff - France 41\n91\n93\nAglaophenia lophocarpa Meknes - Gulf of Cadiz\nAglaophenia lophocarpa Pen Duick Escarpment, Mercator, Kidd - Gulf of Cadiz\nAglaophenia lophocarpa Mercator - Gulf of Cadiz\n[\u00a1Aglaophenia tubulifera Ib\u00e9rico - Gulf of Cadiz\n100Aglaophenia tubulifera Lundi Island - U.K.\nrMacrorhynchia phoenicea Madagascar\n70LtMacrorhynchia philippina San Sebastian - Brazil\n51\u2014 Gymnangium gracilicaule Madagascar\n100 Gymnangium montagui Lundi Island - U.K.\nGymnangium hians Andaman Sea - Thailand\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nG. montagui &amp; G. hians\nG. gracilicaule Vs\nt\nA. tubiformis Vs \u2019 A. octodonta Vs |-|^ A. pluma\nWithin\tWithin\tBetween\nspecies\tgenera\tgenera\n0-1.06\t0.21-21.95\t9.35-24.25\nn= 3\tn=3\tn=5\nFig. 5.3 A, B.

The Sertulariidae was recovered as polyphyletic in the analysis because the sequence of S. tricuspidatus tends to cluster more closely to a group of Halecium species (note on Fig. 5.4A the S. tricuspidatus is closer to the outgroup of Halecium species) rather than to the eight genera of Sertulariidae represented in the analysis, although with weak support. Furthermore, the high genetic distance between the Symplectoscyphus haplotype and the genus Sertularella is strong evidence that these genera are not congeneric as thought previously (see notes in Cornelius 1995b: 94). Unless the S. tricuspidatus sequence is a result of contamination or misidentification, the inclusion of a species with a \u2018typical' Sertulariidae appearance in the Haleciidae clade is surprising. Symplectoscyphus tricuspidatus may represent a transitory stage between Sertulariidae and Haleciidae although without evidence from further taxa within the group or other gene(s) this is speculation. All the other Sertulariidae species represented form a well-supported monophyletic clade (Fig. 5.4A). The genus Sertularella, represented by Se. rugosa, Se. gayi robusta and Se. polysonias (the latter two species looking distinct \u2014 see Fig. 5.4B), form a monophyletic group that is a sister taxon to a clade containing the genera Amphisbetia, Dynamena, Diphasia, Sertularia, Thuiaria, Abietinaria and Hydrallmania. Within this clade, the genera Amphisbetia, Hydrallmania and Diphasia form three distinctive isolated stems corroborating their generic status. Dynamena and Sertularia haplotypes group together only weakly, highlighting the possibility that these two genera are polyphyletic. Sertularia cupressina, Thuiaria thuja, Abietinaria abietina and Ab. filicula surprisingly all fall within a well supported clade suggesting that they may be congeneric species, but the relationships amongst these taxa are not fully resolved (Fig. 5.4A,B). The intraspecific genetic distances between the represented specimens of Hydrallmania falcata and Diphasia rosacea are within a \u2018normal' range, although the divergence is high between the two genotypes of the latter species sampled from relatively close geographical localities along the south-western coast of England.\n97\n\u2014 Halecium muricatum Gardur - Iceland\nHalecium labrosum Gardur - Iceland\n(A)\n99\nSymplectoscyphus tricuspidatus Sandgerdi - Iceland\n-----Amphisbetia minima Devonport - New Zealand\n- Dynamena disticha Mallorca - Spain\nDynamena pumila Sandgerdi - Iceland\n\u2014 Diphasiafallax Gardur - Iceland\n85f Diphasia rosacea Lundi Island - U.K. \u2014 Diphasia rosacea Plymouth - U.K.\n47i---Sertularia unguiculata Leigh - New Zealand\n-------Sertularia perpusilla Mallorca - Spain\ni\u2014 Sertularia cupressina Lundi Island - U.K.; Gardur - Iceland\n82 T Thuiaria thuja Sandgerdi - Iceland 53|T a\n54>\u2014\n10\n33\n75\n9\n79\n0.1\nr 10\n100\n85 JD\n53\tj- Abietinaria abietina Gardur - Iceland\n54\tI\u2014 Abietinariafilicula Gardur - Iceland\n100 i Hydrallmaniafalcata Plymouth, Lundi Island - U.K. Hydrallmaniafalcata Gardur - Iceland\n----Sertularella rugosa Sandgerdi, Gardur - Iceland\n2^1\u2014Sertularella gayi robusta Pen Duick Escarpment - Gulf of Cadiz Sertularella polyzonias Mercator - Gulf of Cadiz\n15\n10\n5\n0\n(B)\nDynamena\n--------------------------\nAbietinaria Vs\nThuiaria thuja Vs S. cupressina\n-------------------1\nS. polyzonias Vs\nS. gayi\nWithin\nWithin\tBetween\nspecies\tgenera\tgenera\n0.80-1.40\t2.05-9.61\t2.20-14.21\nn=3\nn=5\tn=10\nFig. 5.4 A, B.

Halecium muricatum and Ha. labrosum are the outgroup taxa. Numbers near the nodes indicate the percent bootstrap values. The branch length indicator represents 0.1 substitutions per site. Note that Symplectoscyphus tricuspidatus is genetically closer to the outgroup. (B) Graphic of the 16 S sequence divergences as uncorrected P-values (%): within species, within genera and between genera.\nFamily Haleciidae\nIn this family the sequence of Hydrodendron diverges markedly from the 10 Halecium species represented, supporting its inclusion in a different genus, but also giving low support for the monophyly of Haleciidae (Figs 5.1 and 5.5A). The genus Halecium also cannot be confirmed as monophyletic on the basis of 16S haplotype data (Figs 5.1 and 5.5A). Two divergent main clusters are consistently recovered within Halecium. One clade comprises the Ha. sibogae marrocanum haplotype which is considerably divergent to the sister group that is subdivided into a clade containing Ha. tenellum and Ha. labrosum, and another with Ha. muricatum and an unidentified deep-water species from an active mud volcano from the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 5.5A). This unnamed species has morphological similarities to Ha. muricatum. In the other main branch of Halecium, Ha. halecinum and Ha. beanni can be found tightly grouped (Fig. 5.5B) and sister to Ha. petrosum, Ha. lankesteri and Halecium sp2, the last two species being more closely related (Fig. 5.5B).\nFamily Lafoeidae\nThe monophyly of Lafoeidae was not unequivocally supported by the present 16S data (Figs 5.1 and 5.6A). This family is represented by two well-supported main clades, divergent and of an uncertain relationship (Figs 5.1 and 5.6A). One clade corresponds to the nominal subfamily Zygophylacinae containing the genera Zygophylax and Cryptolaria. The other represents the subfamily Lafoeinae including the genera Lafoea and Acryptolaria. The high 16S sequence dissimilarity between these subfamilies, supports the elevation of the Zygophylacinae and Lafoeinae to the categories of family, as suggested by Stepanyants (1979). Within the \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 clade there is a good demarcation of species, and Cryptolaria pectinata appears to be derived from the genus Zygophylax, to which it is closely related (Fig. 5.6B). There are two distinct haplotypes of Zygophylax biarmata collected from the Pen Duick Escarpment in Gulf of Cadiz in different years (3 years interval). Among the \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 clade, A. conferta seems to present a unique haplotype along the Pen Duick Escarpment, and appears to be a sister taxon to a clade containing two very divergent genotypes of Lafoea dumosa: one from the bathyal depths of the Gulf of Cadiz, the other from Iceland (Fig. 5.6B). This suggests that the well-known and widespread L. dumosa could also be a species complex and clearly warrants further investigation in the waters of the NE Atlantic.\n79\nSertularia cupressina Gardur - Iceland\n(A)\nSertularella rugosa Sandgerdi\nHydrodendron gardineri Andaman Sea - Thailand\nHalecium sibogae marocanum Mekn\u00e8s \u2014 Gulf of Cadiz\n93\n100\nHalecium sp. 1 Mekn\u00e8s \u2014 Gulf of Cadiz\nHalecium muricatum Gardur - Iceland\n82\n94\n100\n100\nHalecium muricatum Lundi island \u2014 U.K.\nHalecium tenellum Lundi island \u2014 U.K.\nHalecium labrosum Gardur - Iceland\n47\nHalecium petrosum Mallorca - Spain\nHalecium sp.2 Carvoeiro - Portugal\n100\n78\nHalecium lankesteri Plymouth, Lundi Island \u2014 U.K.\n100 Halecium halecinum Lundi Island \u2014 U.K.\n0.1\nHalecium beanni Plymouth \u2014 U.K.\nspecies\tgenus\tgenera\n0-0.2\t1.2-15.44\t15.84-19.37\nn=1\tn=1\tn=2\nFig. 5.5 A, B.

Overall E. racemosum represents the earliest diverging lineage included in the analysis. The remaining Eudendrium haplotypes together occur as a clade although this is not very well supported (Fig. 5.7A,B). This clade may split into two, one containing E. capillare and a divergent species from two active mud volcanoes located in the middle of the Gulf of Cadiz (below 1000 m). The other clade contains three haplotypes from the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz. One of these haplotypes from the Mercator mud volcano (ca. 350 m) represents an unidentifiable monosiphonic colony, that is, a clearly divergent evolutionary unit to haplotypes representing polysiphonic colonies morphologically similar to E. rameum (Fig. 5.7A). Polysiphonic colonies of E. rameum comprise genetically distinct populations from the Meknes mud volcano (700 m) and the Pen Duick Escarpment (ca. 500 m; Fig. 5.7A). The\ndiversity of Eudendrium haplotypes in the bathyal environments from the Gulf of Cadiz, resolved by the 16S data, is therefore higher than previously recognized. Morphologically these specimens look very similar to each other. For example, the polysiphonic colonies of Eudendrium sp1 have gonophores and cnidocysts of the same type and size range, to specimens of E. rameum from the Moroccan margin. Without the additional information provided by 16S sequence analysis it is likely that these colonies would have been regarded as conspecific. However, much of the material collected from the Gulf of Cadiz is infertile and in a poor condition and is therefore unsuitable for taxonomic and/or molecular studies. More specimens will have to be collected, identified and the 16S gene sequenced, in order to understand the correct identity and distribution of species and populations across the active mud volcanoes and the surrounding environments of the Gulf of Cadiz.\nTubiclavoides striatum Pen Duick Escarpment - Gulf of Cadiz\n60\n76\n59\nEudendrium racemosum Mallorca - Spain\nEudendrium capillare St. Pol de Leon - France\n100\nEudendrium sp. 1 Jesus Baraza - Gulf of Cadiz\nEudendrium sp. 1 Captain Arutyunov - Gulf of Cadiz\nEudendrium sp. 2 Mercator - Gulf of Cadiz\n15\n10\nE. racemosum Vs&lt;\nE. rameum 1\n-------------1\nEudendrium sp. 1 Vs\nE. capillare\n\u25a0 Eudendrium rameum Mekn\u00e8s - Gulf of Cadiz\n100\n\u2014t\u2014\nWithin species 0-0.24 n=2\nWithin genus\n5.6-12.26 n=1\n5\n0\nEudendrium rameum Pen Duick Escarpment - Gulf of Cadiz\n0.1\nFig. 5.7 A, B.

However, it also provides sufficiently broad resolution to distinguish genera, families and even a superfamily (Plumularoidea), and to infer relationships amongst and between many of these taxonomic groups at different hierarchical levels. In some cases, the 16S rRNA may provide information at the population level although sample sizes were not sufficiently large to investigate this in the present study.\nAs a barcoding gene the most useful aspect of the 16S sequence data is its ability to resolve cryptic species (e.g. within N. antennina and L. dumosa) and by contrast cases of apparent conspecificity (e.g. N. antennina and N. perrieri, and A. octodonta, A. pluma and A. tubiformis), congenerity (e.g. case of Se. cupressina, Th. thuja, Ab. abietina and Ab. filicula) or other systematic problems. In the present study the 16S sequence data demonstrated that species previously considered as common and widely distributed are in fact species complexes, a result that does not support the view of Hydrozoa as having cosmopolitan or widespread distributions.\nThe identification of many of the hydrozoan species using morphology is especially difficult as diagnostic features (e.g. reproductive structures) may not always be visible for ontogenetic reasons, because of environmental influences on morphology or because of damage during sampling and preservation. Characters are often subject to a high degree of phenotypic variation driven by the environment and they may be often homoplasious through evolutionary convergence. The systematics of the medusoid phase of hydroids is also long overdue for revision and there are many cases where the pelagic and benthic stages of hydroids have double taxonomic status.\nPresently, about 450 hydrozoan 16S sequences have been published in public genetic data bases (mainly GenBank). This still under-represents the roughly 3700 described species (Bouillon et al. 2006), but the number of phylogenetic studies including 16S sequences of Hydrozoa have accelerated dramatically in recent years (Bridge et al. 1995; Romano &amp; Palumbi 1997; Watkins &amp; Beckenbach 1999; Schierwater &amp; Ender 2000; Ender &amp; Schierwater 2003; Collins et al. 2005; Dunn et al. 2005; Govindarajan et al.\n2005a,b; Schuchert 2005a,b, 2006; Fraser et al. 2006; Govindarajan et al. 2006; Schuchert &amp; Reiswig 2006; Galea &amp; Lecrere 2007; Hemmrich et al. 2007; Leclere et al. 2007; Miglietta et al. 2007; Moura et al. 2007) and is set to grow in the near future. A well-populated sequence data base will greatly enhance the systematics of the hydrozoans and will promote their study in ecology and other aspects of biology.\nMolecular taxonomy (barcoding) has been sometimes seen as a threat to Linnean systematics, but the present study clearly demonstrates that additional evidence from morphological analysis and other sources of data (i.e. geographical origin of specimens) are essential when interpreting genetic information. Thus, 16S nucleotide sequence data has the potential to successfully complement classical Linnean taxonomy in order to resolve distinct evolutionary units and better understand their associations, especially when exploring new, under-sampled habitats, such as the deep sea, that may contain many new taxa.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThanks are due to the co-chief scientists L.

Here, 77 new 16S mtDNA sequence \u2018barcodes\u2019 of Atlantic and Mediterranean sertulariids were subject to phylogenetic analyses along with another 29 already deposited in GenBank. Among the 12 nominal genera and around 40 putative species analysed, several taxonomic inconsistencies and corroborations were highlighted by the genetic data. Patterns of morphological characters between the specimens analysed genetically were congruent with molecular estimates. The genera Sertularia, Dynamena and Symplectoscyphus were found to be polyphyletic, and the genus Sertularella paraphyletic. The validity of Sertularella robusta at a species level was confirmed, along with the exclusion of Sertularelloides cylindritheca from the genus Sertularella. Potential\ncryptic species were detected within Sertularella fusiformis, Sertularella mediterranea, Sertularella ellisii, Sertularia distans, Dynamena disticha, Thuiaria articulata and Diphasia margareta. Conversely, probable cases of synonymy were revealed for the species pairs: Sertularia cupressina and Sertularia argentea, Amphisbetia minima and Amphisbetia operculata, and Thuiaria thuja and T. articulata. 16S haplotype data also revealed probable phylogeographic structure across localities of the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean. As an alternative \u2018DNA barcode\u2019, the 16S gene has the great advantage of being easily amplified and sequenced across hydrozoan taxa. Furthermore, the marked increase in deposited 16S sequences in public databases facilitates the identification of hydrozoan samples to the level of family, genus, and especially species or even populations, in a manner that is coherent with phenotypic and geographic/environmental differences.\n6.1\tINTRODUCTION\nBarcoding life with standardized molecular biomarkers is increasingly being used successfully as an aid for the identification of taxa that may represent distinct and/or new species (after works of Floyd et al. 2002; Hebert et al. 2003a, b). At a time when biodiversity studies are being seen as important because of human-induced environmental change but are inhibited by the taxonomic impediment (e.g. Boero 2010), DNA barcoding has revitalized taxonomy by revealing a hitherto overlooked but significant cryptic diversity (e.g. Hebert et al. 2004a, b; Janzen et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2006) . Such approaches also allow: the connection of life stages and genders, where species are sexually dimorphic (Beskansky et al. 2003; Janzen et al. 2005); the clarification of problems of synonymy (Alroy 2002), and the attraction of more funds and public interest in taxonomic research (Hebert &amp; Gregory 2005). Moreover, DNA barcoding approaches have revealed the potential to test taxonomic hypotheses, including phylogenetic relationships, and can also provide new insights into evolution, especially if it is integrated with other types of data, including molecular, morphological, distributional, ecological and\nbehavioral (e.g. Dayrat 2005; Hebert &amp; Gregory 2005; Savolainen et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2005; Will et al. 2005; Padial et al. 2010; Moura et al. 2011c).\nThe mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene was proposed and adopted as the preferred gene to barcode animal life (Hebert et al. 2003a, b). However, in Hydrozoa the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene has been more widely accepted for barcoding purposes than COI (Moura et al. 2008). COI and other mitochondrial genes (including 16S) exhibit slow evolutionary rates in most Anthozoa (McFadden et al. 2000, 2011; Shearer et al. 2002; Hellberg 2006; Shearer &amp; Coffroth 2008; Huang et al. 2008) and therefore COI has been assumed to be useless for DNA barcoding in this taxon. However, Sinniger et al. (2008) recommended that both COI and 16S markers can be useful as DNA barcodes of species of the order Zoantharia, as each gene has advantages and disadvantages. COI has been the preferred mitochondrial gene to investigate species boundaries and phylogenetics of Scyphozoa (e.g. Dawson &amp; Jacobs 2001; Dawson &amp; Martin 2001; Holland et al. 2004; Dawson 2005a, b). The 16S marker has been less used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the Scyphozoa (e.g. 597 COI sequences are deposited in GenBank, in contrast to only 48 sequences of 16S), but has also been used successfully in the demarcation of scyphozoan species (e.g. Schroth et al. 2002; Licandro et al. 2010). Recently Ortman et al. (2010) and Bucklin et al. (2011) extrapolated that COI is \u2018broadly useful' for DNA barcoding of species across the Medusozoa (sister clade to Anthozoa, containing Scyphozoa, Cubozoa and Hydrozoa), but is not phylogenetically informative for higher taxonomic ranks. However, the medusozoans barcoded with COI by Ortman et al. (2010) and Bucklin et al. (2011) included a considerable number of Siphonophora (subclass of Hydrozoa), but only few sequences of Cubozoa, Scyphozoa or other subclasses of the Hydrozoa. Shearer et al. (2002) demonstrated that the mutational rate of COI in one hydrozoan species was low, as found in the Anthozoa, but Govindarajan et al. (2005a) found COI to be a faster evolving gene and a more phylogenetically informative one for hydrozoan species. Despite such incongruence or lack of comprehensive studies that test the efficacy of COI as a DNA barcode across Meduzosoa, from a practical point of view, the 16S gene has been found to be much easier to amplify than COI, particularly in the Anthoathecata and Leptothecata groups (Miglietta et al. 2009; C. J. Moura, pers. observation). As a result of the resolution and effectiveness of 16S rDNA for barcoding,\nDNA taxonomy and phylogenetic analyses of Hydrozoa, 1204 16S rDNA sequences are deposited in GenBank at the present time, compared to only 476 COI sequences (an increase of about 200% of 16S sequences \u2018banked' since the last count published by Moura et al. 2008). The 16S gene has allowed recognition and discrimination of nominal and cryptic hydrozoan species (including invasive taxa), but also revealed reasonable potential for phylogenetic, phylogeographic and evolutionary analyses (Bridge et al. 1995; Romano &amp; Palumbi 1997; Watkins &amp; Beckenbach 1999; Schierwater &amp; Ender 2000; Ender &amp; Schierwater 2003; Collins et al. 2005; Dunn et al. 2005; Govindarajan et al. 2005a, b; Schuchert 2005a, b, 2006; Fraser et al. 2006; Govindarajan et al. 2006; Schuchert &amp; Reiswig 2006; Galea &amp; Lecl\u00e8re 2007; Hemmrich et al. 2007; Lecl\u00e8re et al. 2007, 2009; Miglietta et al. 2007, 2009; Moura et al. 2007, 2008, 2011c; Cartwright et al. 2008; Altuna 2009; Cartwright &amp; Nawrocki 2010; Nawrocki et al. 2010; Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 2010; Miranda et al. 2010). For hydrozoans, 16S genetic information has been found to be consistent with nuclear genetic markers (e.g. Elongation Factor 1a, Miglietta et al. 2009; and ITS1 and ITS2, Miranda et al. 2010) and also morphology (e.g. Schuchert 2005; Miglietta et al. 2009; Moura et al. 2011c), further evidence of its potential as a DNA barcoding gene.\nThe family Sertulariidae is the most speciose within the Hydrozoa, containing over 500 species (Bouillon et al. 2006). Sertulariids are essentially benthic polypoid erect colonies, representing a regular faunistic component of seabed communities from coastal to abyssal waters (see examples of Fig. 6.1). Species of Sertulariidae are generally easily recognized at family level, although the differentiation of genera (and often species) is quite difficult, as most of the diagnostic morphological characters (mainly skeletal) are highly variable, even within an individual colony (Bouillon et al. 2006). As a consequence, it is common to find many taxa of Sertulariidae that have been misclassified, complicating the interpretation of many lists of species. The systematics of the family Sertulariidae is recognizably still far from resolved, and the introduction of other sources of diagnostic data, such as DNA sequence information, are critical to improve the taxonomy of the group. The phylogenetics of Sertulariidae was studied by means of genetic markers by Moura et al. (2008), Lecl\u00e8re et al. (2009) and Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2010), but many taxonomic problems still persist in the family that require further investigation.\nIn the present study, we \u2018barcoded\u2019 several sertulariid species, including specimens from the shallow and deep waters of the NE Atlantic and western Mediterranean, by means of 16S rDNA sequence data. These DNA sequences along with others of Sertulariidae, already deposited in GenBank, were analysed phylogenetically with the objective of solving taxonomical problems within the family, namely cases of complicated synonymies, cryptic biodiversity and erroneous species assignments to genera. This barcoding approach was also applied to the identification of specimens unclassifiable by conventional morphological methods (e.g. broken and/or unfertile colonies), and for phylogeographic analyses.\nFig. 6.1: Examples of sertulariids in shallow waters of the Berlengas archipelago - W Portugal: (A) Diphasia margareta; (B) Sertularelloides cylindritheca; (C) Sertularella mediterranea.

Moura.\n6.2\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCollection and identification of samples\nSpecimens of Sertulariidae and Thyroscyphidae were collected from 47 distinct sampling sites of shallow and deep-water localities of the northern Atlantic and western Mediterranean (Fig. 6.2, Table 6.1). Specimens were fixed and preserved mostly in 96% ethanol, although sometimes in 70% ethanol. The material collected in the Azores and Madeira included specimens obtained as part of a study on by-catch from deep-sea fisheries and some were frozen prior to fixation in ethanol. Taxa were classified\ntaxonomically in the laboratory by C. J. Moura mainly based on publications of Picard (1956), Cornelius (1979, 1995), Ramil &amp; Vervoort (1992), Medel (1996), Medel &amp; Vervoort (1998), and Pe\u00f1a Cantero &amp; Garc\u00eda Carrascosa (2002).\nFig. 6.2: Map representing the sampling sites (marked with crosses) from where hydrozoan DNA sequences were determined for the present study.\nDNA extraction, amplification and sequencing\nProtocols for DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (16S) rDNA gene followed the methodology described in Moura et al. (2008), except that the volumes of reagents used for PCR reactions were reduced to half, and that some of the purified PCR products were sent to \u2018STAB VIDA, Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Servi\u00e7os em Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas, Lda', Oeiras, Portugal for sequencing. The primers used were SHA (ACGGAATGAACTCAAATCATGT) and SHB (TCGACTGTTTACCAAAAACATA) (Cunningham &amp; Buss 1993). The skeletons of voucher specimens were mounted in permanent slides and temporarily deposited in the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro (DBUA), Portugal. The material from the Portuguese coast and Gulf of Cadiz is temporarily deposited in the Biological Research Collection of the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro (DBUA), Portugal. Specimens from Madeira remained in the Municipal Museum collection at the Marine Biology Station of Funchal, Portugal. Azorean specimens gathered by the Department of\nOceanography and Fisheries (DOP), University of the Azores, Portugal, were returned to that institution. Sampling details, GenBank, Morphbank and Museums accession numbers are described in Table 6.1.\nPhylogenetic analyses\nThe sequences assembled for this study were clustered with sequences of Sertulariidae published on GenBank. They were then aligned in MEGA version 4 (Tamura et al. 2007) with CLUSTALW using the default alignment settings, and trimmed to the shortest sequence. MrModeltest version 2.3 (Nylander 2004) was used to determine the optimal probabilistic model of sequence evolution. The \u2018general time reversible plus gamma\u2019 was the model selected by the Akaike Information Criterion. \u2018Maximumlikelihood\u2019 phylogenetic analyses were executed through the PHYML website (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/) (Guindon &amp; Gascuel 2003) using the GTR model. Bayesian analyses were also performed with MrBayes v3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist 2001), using the same model. The search was run for 107 generations, with trees sampled every 1000 generations (the first million generations were discarded as \u2018burnin\u2019). Clade stability was assessed using non-parametric bootstrapping of ML analyses (1000 replicates) and Bayesian posterior probability values. MEGA version 4 (Tamura et al. 2007) was used to calculate pairwise distances for simple comparisons of percentage sequence divergence between taxa.\n6.3\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn the present paper phylogenetic analyses were undertaken for 484 base-pairs of partial 16S rDNA sequences (Fig. 6.3) from 106 sertulariids (Sertulariidae and Thyroscyphidae) corresponding to 77 haplotypes of 12 nominal genera and about 40\n831*\n0.2 Subst./ Site\nThyroscyphus marg\u00ednalas Honduras\t4\nSertularelloides cylindritheca Farilh\u00f5es, 17-22 m - W Portugal _ Thyroscyphidae / OUTGROUP\nSertularelloides cylindritheca Estelas, 30-38 m \u2014W Portugal\t\u2018\nSertularelloides cylindritheca Farilh\u00f5es, 28-32 m- W Portugal _\nSymplectoscyphus tricuspidatus Gardur - Iceland > Symplectoscyphus tricuspidatus Salacia desmoldes Flores, J046m - Az\u00f3re/ .\t1\n99|* Salada desmoides Sao Miguel, V.

Cunningham (direct EMBL submission), eight by Moura et al. (2008), 10 by Leclere et al. (2009) and one by Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2010). Two species of Thyroscyphidae (Sertularelloides cylindritheca and Thyroscyphus marginatus), from a hydrozoan family easily confounded morphologically with Sertulariidae were used as an outgroup. These Thyroscyphidae sequences, despite being considerably divergent (9% P distance), cluster together with high nodal support and are genetically very distant from all the other Sertulariidae represented that are recovered as monophyletic (Fig. 6.3). However, if setting for instance the Haleciidae as the outgroup, the Thyroscyphidae is recovered as a divergent long branch nested amongst Sertulariidae, as sister clade to the genus Sertularella (more specifically to Sertularella sanmatiensis). Concomitantly the Sertulariidae is recovered paraphyletic (similarly to some results of Leclere et al. 2009). In fact, some authors (e.g. Millard 1975) have synonymised these two families, but in our analyses, the placement of Thyroscyphidae as a long branch away from the other Sertulariidae supports both families as being valid. Furthermore Ser. cylindritheca is very divergent genetically from the other Sertularella species (Fig. 6.3), thus supporting the argument that this species should be kept in Sertularelloides and not in Sertularella. The re-inclusion of Ser. cylindritheca (and Thyroscyphus marginatus) in Thyroscyphidae is a conservative, although provisional interpretation of these data. Further genetic studies (including other genetic markers) and haplotype sampling is needed for families phylogenetically close to Sertulariidae to test this hypothesis further.\nThe great disadvantage of DNA barcoding with 16S instead of COI includes the frequent presence of indels (insertions/deletions) in 16S sequences, which may complicate the alignment of sequences and consequently may alter the value of sequence divergence according to the alignment adopted. However, the presence of indels can also be advantageous as they may be taxonomically informative of infra- to supraspecific taxonomic levels (e.g. Sinniger et al. 2008; the present study). A particular region (197231 bp) of the alignment herein analysed corresponded to a major indel region that was difficult to align. Therefore to search for any bias related to the alignment, we also ran several phylogenetic analyses with alignments generated through MAFFT, version 6 (http://mafft.cbrc.jp), and alignments with and without gap positions or sequences that\nrepresented long branches (namely Symplectoscyphus tricuspidatus and Thyroscyphidae taxa). The topologies of the phylogenetic trees obtained in these analyses were consistently identical, especially when referring to the clades with higher nodal support of Fig. 6.3.\nGenus Symplectoscyphus\nThe genus Symplectoscyphus is herein represented by two species - Sy. tricuspidatus and Symplectoscyphus turgidus that appear at divergent phylogenetic positions (Fig. 6.3). The 16S rDNA gene is inconclusive about the real phylogenetic position of these two species within the family Sertulariidae, but their genetic distances (8%) seem good evidence to assign them to different genera. Whilst Sy. tricuspidatus is recovered as monophyletic with Symplectoscyphus species present in Antarctica (not shown, see Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 2010), Sy. turgidus seems to cluster more closely to Sertularella species (Leclere et al. 2009; the present study), and likely should be moved again to the genus Sertularella (as firstly proposed by Clark 1876) or even to another (perhaps new) genus. Further studies are therefore required to resolve the phylogenetic position of Sy. turgidus.\nGenus Sertularella\nThe genus Sertularella - represented by 12 nominal species, two (or three) cryptic species and one undetermined species - appears monophyletic (or paraphyletic if we do not consider \u2018Symplectoscyphus\u2019 turgidus as Sertularella), with low bootstrap support (Fig.\n6.3). Leclere et al. (2009), using more genetic markers, also recovered the genus Sertularella as monophyletic (or paraphyletic with \u2018Symplectoscyphus\u2019 turgidus), although without the divergent clades of Sertularella rugosa and Sertularella sanmatiasensis presently represented.\nSertularella gayi is recovered as monophyletic with genetically undifferentiated samples from deep waters of Madeira (Calheta - 1300 m), Azores (Flores Island - 109 -147 m), Gulf of Cadiz (Mercator mud volcano - 352 m) and shallow depths of western Portugal (Berlengas - ca. 30 m) (Fig. 6.3). The species is indeed genetically close to the morphologically similar taxon Sertularella robusta , which was previously considered as a variety of S. gayi, but the consistent monophyly of the \u2018gayi\u2019 phenotype (Fig. 6.3) supports the recent reseparation of these species (e.g. Bouillon et al. 2006).\nSertularella robusta is recovered as monophyletic with four lineages co-occurring at the deep waters of the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 6.3). Genetic distances between the S. robusta haplotypes reach 0.5%.\nThe represented haplotype of Sertularella cf. unituba Calder, 1991 corresponds to one infertile colony from 468 m in the Azores Bank that is morphologically similar to S. robusta (by the sizes of hydrothecae and mode of ramification) but seems rather more phylogenetically close to S. gayi (Fig. 6.3). That Azorean lineage is recovered as a clear distinct species, with a similar phenotype to that of S. unituba namely by the form of hydrothecae, but these structures are distinctly larger in our sample than that of S. unituba measured by Medel &amp; Vervoort (1998) (including type material). Sertularella unituba was also previously considered as a variety of S. gayi, and the present 16S data recognizes the phylogenetic association with these species but also confirms that they are distinct (Fig.\n6.3).\nSertularella rugosa and S. sanmatiasensis, which are only represented by one sample each, were collected from the polar regions and are found genetically divergent from all the other Sertularella species herein represented from the NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Fig. 6.3). The phylogenetic position of S. rugosa and S. sanmatiasensis is uncertain (Fig. 6.3), possibly because of the limitation of the 16S gene (by itself) to establish some intergeneric relationships amongst Sertulariidae.\nAll other Sertularella species represented in the analyses cluster in a well-supported clade comprising the nominal species Sertularella fusiformis, Sertularella mediterranea, Sertularella ellisii, Sertularella ornata and Sertularella polyzonias (Fig.\n6.3). These taxa are indeed morphologically similar so that taxonomic debates on their validity or synonymy have been extensive over years (e.g. Cornelius 1979; Ramil &amp; Vervoort 1992; Medel &amp; Vervoort 1998). The 16S genetic data (Fig. 6.3) proved again to be in agreement with phenotype-based taxonomical classifications, by the recognition of these nominal species and their phylogenetic association. Furthermore the 16S gene provided evidence of cryptic diversity associated with S. mediterranea and S. fusiformis, and resolved an unidentified species from the shallow waters of the Azores (\u2018Sertularella sp.') (Fig. 6.3).\nThe morphology of the latter species resembles somewhat S. ellisii and the hydrothecae of S. polyzonias but phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 6.3) confirm it is distinct.\nThis species has already been identified by Medel &amp; Vervoort (1998) as a variety (\u2018form 3') of S. ellisii, also collected in relatively shallow waters of the Azores. We have therefore the evidence that this corresponds to a new species that can potentially be misidentified as S. ellisii and that this taxon needs to be described.\nSertularella mediterr\u00e1nea has its type locality in Yugoslavia in the Mediterranean Sea. We have represented haplotypes of the species from the Mediterranean (southern France), SW Portugal and Azores (S. Miguel and Terceira Islands) with little genetic divergence, possibly revealing a recent influence of the Mediterranean Sea in the latter two geographical areas (or vice-versa). A quite divergent haplotype (up to 2.5% of genetic distance), originally from northern Portugal (Viana do Castelo), also classified morphologically as S. mediterr\u00e1nea, seems to correspond to a new cryptic species (Fig.\n6.3).\nSertularella fusiformis was originally described from the coasts of Devon (UK). We have no representatives of it from its type locality of temperate cold waters; instead we have samples of that nominal species in distinct clades from the subtropical Madeira and the Azores Islands (each clade corresponding to one archipelago) (Fig. 6.3). These clades likely correspond to different species, according to genetic distances (up to 2.5% between major clades) and some morphological differences (see Table 6.2), and therefore two (or at least one) cryptic species within S. fusiformis were discovered in the present study.\nS. polyzonias is considered a cosmopolitan species (e.g. Ramil &amp; Vervoort 1992), present in both shallow and deep waters (e.g. see Pe\u00f1a Cantero &amp; Garc\u00eda Carrascosa 2002). This species is herein represented by samples recovered from the Portuguese and English coasts and from relatively deep waters of the Azores. Apart from the UK, S. polyzonias does not occur frequently either at the Azores or at the Portuguese coasts (C. J. Moura, pers. observ.), and despite its well-supported monophyletic recovery, the four haplotypes found are somewhat divergent (reach a maximum of 1.9% of sequence divergence). The phylogenetic relationship of its haplotypes appears to be coherent with geographical and bathymetrical distances (perhaps also because of low population sizes in the studied areas), and further studies are therefore required to understand whether S. polyzonias has such a widespread distribution.\nGenus Salacia\nThis genus is represented in the analyses solely by specimens of Salacia desmoides which cluster monophyletically (Fig. 6.3). For that species, four genetically close haplotypes (genetic distant up to 1%) were found in nine samples, respectively, from the Azores (Flores, S. Miguel and Faial Islands), western Portugal and the Mediterranean, and south and southwest Portugal (Algarve and Alentejo) (Fig. 6.3). As with the pattern found for S. mediterranea, there is evidence of recent gene flow between the Mediterranean and western/southern Portugal, and the Azores.\nGenus Diphasia\nThe genus Diphasia is recovered as monophyletic (although with relatively low bootstrap support) with the nominal species Diphasia margareta, Diphasia fallax, Diphasia rosacea, Diphasia delagei and Diphasia pinastrum (Fig. 6.3). Speciesrelationships within the genus are not, however, clearly resolved with 16S sequence data.\nDiphasia margareta is recovered as monophyletic containing a clade with samples from shallow waters of Berlengas and a slightly divergent deep-water lineage from the Azores with two close haplotypes (Fig. 6.3). The genetic distance (up to 2%) between these two main clades may emphasize that gene flow for this species does not presently occur between shallow waters of central Portugal and the bathyal depths of the Azores, contrary to what was found for S. gayi. Furthermore, D. margareta, especially found in deep waters, was known as shallow as 24 m depth (Medel &amp; Vervoort 1998), and we recovered the species at about 10 m in western Portugal, altering its shallowest bathymetrical record.\nDiphasia rosacea was found monophyletic with two close haplotypes co-occurring in the UK (genetically distant 1%) (Fig. 6.3). One of the haplotypes is also present in western Portugal (Berlengas), likely revealing the influence of northern Atlantic waters up to central Portugal (Moura et al. 2011c).\nDiphasia delagei is a quite uncommon species known from depths between ca. 41 (Medel 1996) and 1250 m (Ramil &amp; Vervoort 1992). Our exclusive sample of the species represents its first record in Portugal, and the shallowest record for the species to date (ca. 30 m).\nDiphasia pinastrum was found in deep Azorean waters without much genetic divergence (0-0.7%): two close haplotypes in three samples.\nGenus Amphisbetia\nThe genus Amphisbetia is recovered as monophyletic with two nominal species represented: Amphisbetia operculata and Amphisbetia minima (Fig. 6.3). In five samples of A. operculata, we found two haplotypes in the Azores, one in southern Portugal and the other in South Africa. These are genetically close (up to 1.2% of sequence divergence) and in the \u2018normal\u2019 range of intraspecific sequence variation of sertulariids. A. minima collected from New Zealand diverge very little (1% of genetic distance) from the haplotypes of A. operculata, raising the strong possibility that these two nominal species, that are morphologically similar, are synonymous.\nGenus Sertularia\nThe genus Sertularia is found polyphyletic when represented by seven nominal species: Sertularia distans, Sertularia moluccana, Sertularia unguiculata, Sertularia marginata, Sertulariaperpusilla, Sertularia cupressina and Sertularia argentea (Fig. 6.3).\nSertularia distans is represented by two monophyletic but highly divergent haplotypes (Fig. 6.3). One haplotype was found in northern Portugal, the other in Madeira (Desertas Island) and western Portugal (Berlenga Island). Sequence divergence between these haplotypes is quite high (3.2%), suggesting that they correspond to different species. The corresponding morphotypes share similar characters, although more haplotype sampling of Se. distans (and further genetic and morphologic analyses) is required to determine whether the species is a complex. Furthermore, the phylogenetic position of Se. distans (sensu lato), dislocated from other Sertularia taxa (Fig. 6.3), suggests it should be included in another genus, perhaps the presently invalid genus Tridentata.\nSertularia marginata was recovered as monophyletic with genetically close haplotypes occurring in Madeira and Azores (distant genetically up to 0.5 %) (Fig. 6.3). This species appears as sister to the morphological similar taxon Se. perpusilla (Fig. 6.3), which is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. For the latter species we did not find genetic differentiation between Mallorca and the island of Malta.\nSertularia cupressina is found with high nodal support in a clade with the phenotypically similar Se. argentea (Fig. 6.3). Sequence divergence between the two species is too low (0.2%) and is in the range of intraspecific variation of other Sertulariidae species. Genetic data therefore suggests the synonymization of Se. cupressina and Se. argentea (following Pallas (1766)), but more haplotype sampling of both nominal species is required for confirmation. Furthermore, as in Moura et al. (2008) and Leclere et al. (2009), the clade of Se. cupressina clusters tightly with Thuiaria and Abietinaria species, suggesting that these taxa may correspond to the same genus. Indeed, these taxa share a synapomorphic morphological character (see Schuchert 2001) of having an ectodermal pad in the inner part of the adcauline wall of hydrothecae that further supports such a phylogenetic relationship.\nGenus Thuiaria\nThe genus Thuiaria represented by Thuiaria articulara and Thuiaria thuja, is recovered as monophyletic, although with low nodal support (Fig. 6.3). These two species are morphological similar, but differ on the general structure of colonies and projection of hydrothecal walls out of the axis (see Cornelius 1995). Our analyses (Fig. 6.3) show that two divergent clades of T. articulata (one from coastal waters of northern Portugal, the other from bathyal depths of Greenland, genetic distance up to 1.7%) cluster with an intermediate lineage containing T. thuja from deep waters of Iceland. The type localities of T. thuja and T. articulata are from coastal waters of Scotland and England (respectively), and therefore the phylogeny suggests that T. \u2018articulata\u2019 found in deep waters of Greenland likely corresponds to a cryptic species that can also exhibit the typical phenotype described for T. thuja, which consequently may be synonymous to T. articulata. We therefore hypothesize that there is a distinct Thuiaria species in the deep waters of Greenland and Iceland, presenting morphological characters close to T. thuja and T. articulata.\nGenus Abietinaria\nThe genus Abietinaria is recovered as monophyletic with low nodal support (Fig.\n6.3). It comprises two reciprocally monophyletic clades comprising Abietinariafilicula and\nAbietinaria abietina, respectively, without much interspecific sequence divergence (up to 4%).\nGenus Dynamena\nThe genus Dynamena herein represented by Dynamena quadridentata, Dynamena pumila and Dynamena disticha, is recovered as polyphyletic, with these species falling at relatively distant positions of the cladogram (Fig. 6.3).\nDynamena disticha is the only species of the genus that was sampled from a wide geographic area. No sequence differentiation was found in samples from three Azorean islands (S. Miguel, Faial and Flores). Three more slightly divergent haplotypes are found in Madeira, and a different haplotype is shared between the western Mediterranean (Mallorca) and western Portugal (Berlengas). One lineage from Madeira is very close genetically to the Azorean haplotypes (genetic distance of 0.2%), but two other evolutionary branches also present in Madeira diverge with relatively high distances (up to 2.7%) from the other Dy. disticha clades (Fig. 6.3). Further studies are therefore required to determine whether cryptic diversity may be associated with this nominal species.\nGenus Hydrallmania\nThe genus Hydrallmania is recovered as monophyletic, represented by two close haplotypes of Hydrallmania falcata (diverging 0.5%), from the UK and Iceland, respectively. The phylogenetic position of the genus within Sertulariidae is not sufficiently resolved solely by 16S haplotype data (Fig. 6.3).\n6.\t4 CONCLUSIONS\nThe present work confirmed the utility of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequence data as \u2018DNA-barcodes\u2019, providing sufficiently high species-level resolution to identify hydrozoan species (Govindarajan et al. 2005a, b; Schuchert 2005a, b; Govindarajan et al. 2006; Miglietta et al. 2007, 2009; Moura et al. 2008, 2011c; Miglietta &amp; Lessious 2009; Nawrocki et al. 2009; Miranda et al. 2010; Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 2010). At taxonomic ranks\nsuperior to species, the 16S gene (by itself) could not resolve many of the phylogenetic associations within sertulariids possibly because of a relatively slow evolutionary rate of 16S for these taxa (Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 2010). Therefore, most of the relationships between (and sometimes within) genera of sertulariids presented in the phylogeny were not conclusive. Regardless of this, the genetic data presented resolved many areas of phylogenetic topology, refuted assignments of species and genera, and gave probable insights into phylogeographic associations within species. DNA barcoding with 16S genetic data also highlighted potential cryptic and synonymous species and provided correspondence of morphologically unidentifiable specimens (e.g. unfertile or degraded) with accurately classified biological material.\nAll the characterized genera were recovered monophyletic, with exception of Sertularia, Dynamena, Symplectoscyphus and Sertularella. The former genus is recovered paraphyletic (as in Leclere et al. 2009) only if Sy. turgidus is not re-included in Sertularella, the other genera were found polyphyletic. Symplectoscyphus is polyphyletic for the reason previously stated, whilst the genera Sertularia and Dynamena comprise several species which are very divergent, sometimes more related to other genera. Our data therefore suggested that Sertularia and Dynamena are truly polyphyletic genera that require significant taxonomic revisions.\nAt a supra-specific phylogenetic level the 16S data also confirmed that Ser. cylindritheca does not belong to the genus Sertularella and possibly neither to the family Sertulariidae. We suggested its re-inclusion in the genus Sertularelloides and (at least provisionally) in the family Thyroscyphidae.\nAt a taxonomic species rank, evidence was presented for the validation of S. robusta as a distinct species from S. gayi. However, it was also demonstrated that two pairs of nominal species might be synonymous (Se. cupressina and Se. argentea, and A. minima and A. operculata) Furthermore the 16S gene also resolved potential cryptic diversity within S. fusiformis, S. mediterranea, S. ellisii, Se. distans, Dy. Disticha, T. articulata and D. margareta. Furthermore, because the cryptic species of T. \u2018articulata\u2019 found in Greenland seemed conspecific to T. thuja found in Iceland, we also question the validity of this latter species.\nAt an infraspecific taxonomical level some probable phylogeographic affinities were revealed. Identical intraspecific 16S sequences, possibly revealing ongoing or recent\ngenetic migration, were detected in shallow-water samples of different Azorean islands (for S. desmoides, A. operculata, Dy. disticha, S. cf. fusiformis); from W and SW Portugal and the Mediterranean (for S. desmoides and S. mediterranea); from W Portugal and the UK (for D. rosacea); and from shallow waters of W Portugal and deep-water localities of the Azores, Madeira and Gulf of Cadiz (for S. gayi). Low levels of sequence divergence were also detected between samples of: shallow waters of W Portugal and Azores (for A. operculata); W Portugal and Madeira (for S. distans); Azores and Madeira (for Dy. disticha and S. marginata); W Portugal and Mediterranean (for Dy. disticha); and between Azores, SW Portugal and the Mediterranean (for S. mediterranean These null or slight nucleotide differences of 16S sequences between hydrozoan samples probably reveal present or relatively recent gene flow between the different geographical areas clustered, especially when the same haplotypes are shared between localities. Such potential phylogeographical affinities detected are likely influenced by water currents and properties (e.g. temperature), dispersal modes of species (including rafting on biologic and/or artificial substrata for some taxa), population sizes, geographical distance and potential environmentally driven physiological constrains.\nFinally, the 16S genetic data supported the morphological similarity and discontinuities of taxa. For example, Se. marginata revealed sister to the phenotypically similar Se. perpusilla; A. minima is genetically close to A. operculata; and S. ellisii, S. ornata, S. fusiformis, S. polyzonias and S. mediterranea that have been synonymized and set apart over years are indeed distinct but genetically closely-related species. Furthermore, consistent morphological differences can also be detected in probable cryptic species identified genetically, after a subsequent closer inspection of voucher specimens (e.g. in the cryptic S. mediterranea).\nThe present work based on 16S sequence data proved to resolve many taxonomic problems of the complicated serturaliid nomenclature and sets another starting point for further investigations on these taxa. More haplotype sampling coupled with the sequencing of other genetic markers, and the posterior search of diagnostic morphological characters will be important for the scrutiny of the various systematic troubles highlighted (and others) in such a highly diverse marine invertebrate family. Whilst higher genetic representation is still required for the establishment of genetic distance thresholds to differentiate hydrozoan species solely with 16S sequence data, we point (conservatively) to\na maximum of about 2% divergence for 16S intraspecific sequence divergence in Sertulariidae (depending on the alignment and totality of bp analysed). Failing the recognition of a strict 16S \u2018barcoding gap\u2019 for Sertulariidae (or other Hydrozoa), specific genetic distance limits between species for particular taxonomic groups may be required possibly because of heterogeneity of mutational rates across hydrozoan taxa, for example as verified between Plumulariidae and Sertulariidae (Leclere et al. 2007; Moura et al. 2008). Nevertheless the dramatic increase in 16S sequences deposits in GenBank is already facilitating accurate correspondences or phylogenetic affinities of new hydrozoan barcodes to previously established species, genera or families.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the cruise participation invitations by the co-chief scientists L.

We used the molecular marker 16S mRNA to address phylogenetic relations of \u2018Lafoeoidea\u2019 hydroids mainly from shallow and deep waters of the north-east Atlantic and west Mediterranean. This study proves that the morphological simplicity of the \u2018Lafoeoidea\u2019 has led to several erroneous taxonomic assignments. We demonstrate that the superfamily \u2018Lafoeoidea\u2019 is not monophyletic and thus not valid; the families Hebellidae and Lafoeidae are polyphyletic. The \u2018Lafoeidae\u2019 subfamilies \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 and \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 were recovered monophyletic but quite distantly related and should be erected to the level of distinct families. The 16S haplotype data analyzed in conjunction with morphological\ncharacters and distribution data was useful in differentiating morphologically undistinguishable, nominal and cryptic or pseudo-cryptic species, including undescribed taxa. Particularly within the \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 group, unexpectedly high genetic biodiversity (including cryptic species) was encountered in the possibly not monophyletic genera Lafoea, Acryptolaria and Fillelum. Cryptic diversity is also likely associated with the \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 nominal species Cryptolaria pectinata. The indications of genetic segregation by geographical distance of the \u2018Lafoeoidea\u2019 hydroids, particularly verified in deep waters, is probably a consequence of their reduced potential for large-scale dispersal which likely interacts with the influence of the seabed topography, oceanographic circulation and adaptability to tolerate different abiotic conditions.\n7.1\tINTRODUCTION\nAccording to the phylogenetic hypotheses formulated by Cartwright et al. (2008) and Leclere et al. (2009), the hydrozoan family Lafoeidae A. Agassiz, 1865 may represent the most primitive forms of Leptothecate hydroids. The gross morphology of Lafoeidae species ranges from minute stolonal, to bushy erect colonies, always with very simply structured hydrothecae, usually with basic tubular to campanulate forms, sometimes\nsupported by a pedicel (cf. diagnoses in Bouillon et al. 2006). \u2018Lafoeids\u2019 are especially abundant and therefore ecologically important components of the deep-sea benthic faunas,\nbut sometimes also thrive at coastal depths (e.g. Fig. 7.1).\nFig. 7.1: Hydrozoan colonies of Lafoea dumosa (Lafoeidae) overgrowing rocky bottoms in coastal waters of central Portugal (Berlenga Island, ca. 10 meters). Photo credits: C. J. Moura.\nThe systematics of Lafoeidae has been largely disputed at various taxonomic ranks. The family Hebellidae Fraser, 1912 has been included in the superfamily Lafoeoidea A. Agassiz, 1865 alongside with Lafoeidae, or within the Lafoeidae (see Marques et al. 2006). However Cartwright et al. (2008) and Leclere et al. (2009) found \u2018hebelliids\u2019 phylogenetically closer to \u2018Statocysta\u2019 rather than to the \u2018lafoeiid\u2019 Lafoea dumosa (Fleming, 1820). This suggests that Hebellidae does not even belong to the Lafoeoidea, which confirmed the hypotheses of Schuchert (2001) that there is no synapomorphy uniting the Lafoeidae and Hebellidae and that the similarity of their hydrothecae likely corresponds to a plesiomorphy. Within the Lafoeidae, Moura et al. (2008) found that its sub-families Lafoeinae A. Agassiz, 1865 and Zygophylacinae Quelch, 1885 seem unrelated, and therefore suggested that these groups should be re-elevated to the level of family (as previously suggested by Stepanjants 1979). The systematics of Lafoeidae sensu lato (s. l.) at the levels of genera and species within these sub-families (or independent families) is far from well-resolved, mostly because of their simple and highly plastic structure, despite some recent efforts to resolve morphological characters (e.g. Marques et al. 2004, 2005a, b, 2006; Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 1998, 2007).\nCryptic diversity within Lafoeidae s. l. was previously detected by using molecular approaches solely in a single nominal species - Lafoea dumosa (Moura et al. 2008). The simple structure of these animals means that more cryptic diversity is likely to be discovered within the group. The medusoid phase is apparently suppressed in the life cycle of \u2018lafoeiids\u2019 (excluding some of the Hebellidae) (e.g. Bouillon et al. 2006). Instead colonies release planulae that are carried in the water column, before they settle on a substratum and metamorphose into a stolonal or erect sessile colony (e.g. Hughes 1977; Sommer 1992). Because the dispersive pelagic stage is potentially short (e.g. Hughes 1977; Sommer 1992), gene-flow may be highly constrained by population size, the local current regime and availability and type of substrata (including substrata that may raft). In the northeast Atlantic and west Mediterranean, \u2018lafoeiids\u2019 are often locally abundant and have the ability to overgrow a multitude of surfaces including artificial substrata and other hydrozoan colonies (C.J. Moura, pers. observ.). They may be pioneer faunal colonizers, and can also raft on anthropogenic or natural materials (Moura, pers. observ.). Many species of Lafoeidae s. l. (e.g. Acryptolaria conferta (Allman, 1877), Lafoea dumosa and\nFilellum serratum (Clarke, 1879)) are assumed to have widespread vertical and horizontal distributions, but these assumptions have never been tested by means of molecular methods.\nNucleotidic sequence data of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene have been notably useful, coherent and popularly used to extrapolate phylogenetic relations of hydrozoans from the taxonomic levels of families to populations (cf. review of Moura et al. 2011a). For these reasons and because the 16S is easily amplified through PCR, it has also been more used for \u2018DNA barcoding\u2019 purposes of hydrozoans in detriment of the COI (cf. review of Moura et al. 2011a).\nIn the present paper, we \u2018barcoded\u2019 with the 16S marker (sensu Moura et al. 2011a) a relatively high representation and diversity of taxa within the Hebellidae and Lafoeidae from the North-east Atlantic and West Mediterranean. We aimed to resolve the phylogenetic relationships between taxa and resolve significant taxonomic problems within these groups, taking into account the phylogenetic hypotheses of Leclere et al. (2009) obtained with more conserved genetic markers but with considerably less Lafoeoidea s. l. sampled. For this reason, specimens of Campanulinidae were also included, in order to test the phylogenetic placement of the \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 clade (see Leclere et al. 2009). We also intended to investigate cryptic diversity and phylogeographic associations in genetically well-represented taxa.\n7.2\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCollection and identification of samples\nSpecimens of Lafoeidae, Hebellidae and Campanulinidae were collected from 41 sampling sites of various shallow and deep-water localities of the northern Atlantic and western Mediterranean (Fig. 7.2, Appendix A). Specimens were fixed and preserved mostly in 96% ethanol, although sometimes in 70% ethanol. The material collected in Azores and Madeira included specimens obtained as part of a study on by-catch from deepsea fisheries and some were frozen prior to fixation in ethanol. Taxa were sorted and classified taxonomically in the laboratory by C. J. Moura mainly based on publications of\nCornelius (1975), Millard (1975), Ramil and Vervoort (1992), Medel (1996), Boero et al. (1997), Pe\u00f1a Cantero and Garc\u00eda Carrascosa (2002), Bouillon et al. (2006), and Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2007). Morphometric measurements were taken using a graticule on a compound stereo microscope in order to assess the diagnostic value of several characters in representatives of nominal species or genus within genetically distinct clades.\nAzore:\nAfrica\n'-'\u2019X Europe Ik \\\nFig. 7.2: Map representing the sampling sites (marked with crosses) from where hydrozoan DNA sequences were determined for the present study. Abbreviations: GoC, Gulf of Cadiz; PT, Portugal.\nDNA extraction, amplification and sequencing\nProtocols for DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (16S) rDNA gene followed the methodology described in Moura et al. (2011a). The treatment and deposition of voucher specimens in museums is analogous also to that of Moura et al. (2011a). Sampling details, GenBank, Morphbank and Museums accession numbers are presented in Table 7.5. The sequence datasets used for the phylogenetic inferences herein presented were deposited in TreeBASE (http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/ study/TB2:S 12036).\nPhylogenetic analyses\nThe 16S sequences of the putative superfamily Lafoeoidea (including Hebellidae and Lafoeidae s. l.) and family Campanulinidae assembled for this study were clustered with phylogenetically close sequences previously published on GenBank. The choice of\nsequences for inclusion in the analyses, including the use of Bougainvillia sequences as outgroup (see all metadata of sequences in Table 7.5), was especially influenced by the phylogenetic hypothesis presented by Marques et al. (2006) and Leclere et al. (2009). Based on the phylogenetic hypotheses of Leclere et al. (2009) that placed Lafoea dumosa (Lafoeidae, subfamily Lafoeinae) at a basal phylogenetic position to other Leptothecata hydroids, we included for the analyses presented in Fig. 7.3 a sequence of \u2018athecate\u2019 hydrozoan (Stylaster cf. multiplex) as the outgroup. A \u2018blast\u2019 search in Genbank for a 16S sequence of Lafoea dumosa retrieved the sequence of Stylaster cf. multiplex as the more identical, further supporting its choice for the outgroup of the phylogenetic reconstructions of Fig. 7.3. The outgroups selected (not shown) for the phylogenetic analyses of the subsets of sequences of Zygophylacinae (Fig. 7.4) and Lafoeinae (Fig. 7.5) were Phialella quadrata and Tiaropsis multicerrata, and Melicertum octocostatum, respectively for each subfamily, taking into account the phylogenetic structure presented in Fig. 7.3. The datasets were aligned in MEGA version 5 (Tamura et al. 2011) with MUSCLE using the default alignment settings, and trimmed to the shortest sequence. Gblocks version 0.91b (Castresana 2000) was used for the phylogenetic reconstructions of Fig. 7.3, with the default settings, to remove ambiguous aligned regions and to select conserved blocks of the alignment. MrModeltest version 2.3 (Nylander 2004) was used to determine the optimal probabilistic model of sequence evolution. The \u2018general time reversible plus gamma\u2019 was the model selected (in all datasets of sequences) by the Akaike Information Criterion. \u2018Maximum-likelihood\u2019 phylogenetic analyses were executed through the PHYML website (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml) (Guindon &amp; Gascuel 2003) using the GTR model. Bayesian analyses were performed with MrBayes v3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist 2001), using again the same model. The searches were run for 10 generations, with trees sampled every 1000 generations (the first 1 million generations were discarded as \u2018burnin\u2019). Clade stability was assessed using non-parametric bootstrapping of ML analyses (1000 replicates) and Bayesian posterior probability values. MEGA version 5 (Tamura et al. 2011) was used to calculate pairwise uncorrected sequence differences (P distances) in the alignments of the datasets used for the analyses of Figs 7.4 and 7.5, for simple comparisons of percentage sequence divergence between taxa.\n7.3\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFifty-seven new 16S sequences of Lafoeidae s. l., Hebellidae, and hydroids with operculated hydrothecae (42, eight and seven sequences, respectively for each group) were determined for the present study. These sequences were analysed phylogenetically in conjunction with twenty-six sequences previously published on GenBank of phylogenetically close taxa - nine by Leclere et al. (2009), eight by Moura et al. (2008), five by Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2010), three by C. W. Cunningham (direct EMBL submission), and one by Cartwright et al. (2008) (see Table 7.5). The topologies of the phylogenetic trees obtained through Bayesian and ML analyses, and with different combinations of sequences and outgroups (not all results shown), were consistently identical, especially when referring to the clades with higher nodal support of Figs 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5. Our phylogenetic reconstructions (Fig. 7.3) were also coherent with those of Leclere et al. (2009), enabling inferences at supra-specific taxonomic levels.\nPhylogenetic analysis between the major clades of the \u2018Lafoeoidea\u2019\nThe monophyly of Lafoeidae s. l. was not supported by the 16S haplotype data (cf. Moura et al. 2008; Fig. 7.3). Two major clades were recovered within the nominal family Lafoeidae, corresponding respectively to the monophyletic subfamilies Zygophylacinae and Lafoeinae (Fig. 7.3). These clades are quite distantly related and highly divergent (Fig. 7.3), supporting their elevation to the family rank (Stepanjants 1979; Moura et al. 2008). Furthermore the \u2018 Lafoeinae\u2019 clade appears phylogenetically more closely related to Stegella lobata (Vanhoffen, 1910) and Melicertum octocostatum (Sars, 1835) (families Campanulinidae Hincks, 1868 and Melicertidae Agassiz, 1862, respectively), and the \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 group may be more closely related to clades of Hebellidae s. l., Phialellidae Russell, 1953, Tiaropsidae Boero, Bouillon &amp; Danovaro, 1987 and two other distinct clades of Campanulinidae s. l. (see Fig. 7.3 and compare with phylogenetic hypothesis of Leclere et al. 2009).\nWe have also tested the relation of Hebellidae with Lafoeidae s. l., and the relation of these families with hydroids of the \u2018\u2018Cuspidella\u2019 type (with operculated hydrotheca), based on results of Cartwright et al. (2008) and Leclere et al. (2009).

Sars, 1874 and Campanulina panicula G.O. Sars, 1874), Tiaropsidae (Tiaropsidium kelseyi Torrey, 1909 and Tiaropsis multicirrata (Sars, 1835)) and Phialellidae (Phialella quadrata (Forbes, 1848)). Assuming these phylogenetic results (Fig. 7.3) are accurate: the \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 may outgroup closely (or even ingroup) the clade of \u2018Statocysta\u2019 as pointed out by Leclere et al. (2009) despite the unshared synapomorphy of medusae production by the \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019. Nevertheless the results indicate that the \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 and \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 do not even belong to the same superfamily (Fig. 3), revealing that their common trait of presenting aggregated gonothecae (in coppinia or scapus) (e.g. see Bouillon et al. 2006) represents in fact a homoplasy or symplesiomorphy. Furthermore, it is demonstrated (Fig. 7.3) that Hebellidae is likely a polyphyletic group with numerous highly divergent and distantly related clades, and that the genera of Hebellidae: Hebella Allman, 1888, Anthohebella Boero, Bouillon &amp; Kubota, 1997 and Staurodiscus Haeckel 1879, seem more closely related to the families Tiarannidae Russell, 1940 [genera Modeeria Forbes, 1848 and Stegopoma Levinsen, 1893) and Laodiceidae Agassiz, 1862 (Laodicea undulata (Forbes &amp; Goodsir, 1851)], rather than to Scandia gigas (Pieper, 1884) or Billardia subrufa (Jaderholm, 1904). The latter two taxa are also currently classified into Hebellidae but are more related to a clade containing \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 amongst other phenotypically-simple hydroid families (see above) (Fig. 7.3). In fact, Andrade and Migotto (1997) and Migotto and Andrade (2000) had already demonstrated the morphological resemblance of medusae of Hebella scandens (Bale, 1888) and Hebella furax Millard, 1957 with the Laodiceidae, but the verified polyphyletic status of Hebellidae (Fig. 7.3) had not been questioned.\nSome of the above mentioned results were also partially verified by Leclere et al. (2009) and Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2010), but with much less taxonomic coverage. The present study therefore provides further support to treat Lafoeinae, Zygophylacinae and Hebeliidae s. l. as independent and quite distantly families.\nPhylogenetic analyses within the \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 clade\nThe \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 clade is represented as a distinctive monophyletic group that includes, with high support, the genera Zygophylax Quelch, 1885, Abietinella Levinsen, 1913 and Cryptolaria Busk, 1857 (Fig. 7.3). However, the phylogenetic relationships between these three nominal groups are not clear (Figs 7.3 and 7.4). Reciprocal clusters of nominal species of \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 are easily discriminated in the trees (Figs 7.3 and 7.4) and are also concordant with the morphological diagnostic characters of species.\nZygvpiiyktx browrnii bulhyal deplhs -GoC Zygophyl-ax iittitvrreii bathyal depl hs - Go C\n\nC.

We maintained the taxonomical decisions with respect to the assignment of the specimens to that nominal species, and no consistent morphological differences (Table 7.1) were found between the lineages discovered (Figs 7.3 and 7.4).\nTherefore we highlight here the possible existence of cryptic diversity within C. pectinata based solely on molecular phylogenetic analyses (Figs 7.3 and 7.4), requiring further investigations on this nominal taxon.\nTable 7.1: Comparative morphometric data (in pm) of the haplotypes of Cryptolaria pectinata.\nStation\tHydrothecae\t\t\t\tNematothecae\t\tNematocysts (large group)\t\n\tAdnate adcauline wall\tFree adcauline wall *\tFree adcauline wall **\tDiameter at rim\tLength\tDiamete\tr Size ranges\tMean Sizes \u00b1 SD (n=10)\nIrving, 452-500 m\t230-340\t150-250\t190-300\t80-100\t60-120\t15-20\t12-14 x 4.5-5\t12.75 \u00b1 2.33 x\n- S Azores\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.95 \u00b1 0.16\nPrincess Alice Bank, 274 m\t310-350\t125-200\t125-200\t100-120\t50-80\t10-20\t12-14 x 4.5-6\t12.9 \u00b1 2.42 x\n- Azores\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.45 \u00b1 0.55\nnear S.

Indeed A. operculata was originally described as Zygophylax (Jaderholm, 1903) but was thereafter disputed taxonomically between taxa of Sertulariidae and Lafoeidae (see Pe\u00f1a &amp; Garc\u00eda Carrascosa 1993). This study suggests its re-inclusion in the genus Zygophylax (Fig. 7.3), but using only 16s rDNA sequences there is insufficient nodal support and congruency between the tree-topologies obtained (Figs 7.3 and 7.4) to support the monophyletic status of Zygophylax and consequently we refrain to reclassify this species at the present time. The only well-supported phylogenetic relation between nominal species of \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019 in our analyses (only in Fig. 7.3) is that between Zygophylax leloupi\nRamil &amp; Vervoort, 1992 and Zygophylax brownei Billard, 1924, which are morphologically well distinctive (e.g. Ramil &amp; Vervoort 1992).\nPhylogeographic inferences\nSome phylogeographic affinities have been detected within the species Z. biarmata and C. pectinata (Figs 7.3 and 7.4). A relatively good representation of haplotypes was obtained for these taxa because they are commonly found in bathyal environments of the NE Atlantic (C.J. Moura, pers. observ.).\nFor Z. biarmata, four distinct but genetically-close haplotypes (up to 0.7% of P distance) co-occurred at different localities of the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz, one of which was also encountered in deep waters of Madeira (Figs 7.3 and 7.5). The multitude of different habitats found in the Gulf of Cadiz (e.g. mud volcanoes, areas of carbonate crusts and/or cold-water coral stands), coupled with the influence of different water-masses and currents in the area (e.g. Perez et al. 1998; Hernandez-Molina et al. 2006), may be correlated to the diversity of Z. biarmata haplotypes discovered in this region (Fig. 7.3), but this supposition requires further testing.\nThe marked phylogeographic structure obtained for Cryptolariapectinata (Figs 7.3 and 7.5) suggests that this nominal species may not be so widely distribution as supposed (e.g. Gili et al. 1989) and in fact may correspond to a complex of cryptic species with morphological similarities. Two haplotypes of C. pectinata were detected in the bathyal habitats of the Gulf of Cadiz, one of these occurring in the Mercator mud volcano (354 meters) is also present in central-western Portugal at a much greater depth (1384 meters). In Azorean waters four distinct haplotypes (0. 8 - 1.9 % of sequence divergence) from three different seamounts were encountered, and a less-related haplotype from the remote Irving seamount (452 - 500 m), located south of the Azores, diverges considerably from all the other 16S sequences of C. pectinata represented in the present study (1.3 -2.2 % of sequence divergence). This genetic diversity discovered in a few samples from geographically proximate locations in the deep sea around the Azores (as similarly verified for Acryptolaria sp1, and A. cf. craussicaulis - see bellow) possibly reveals the impact of retention mechanisms generated by water currents at seamounts or effective barriers of deep-water habitat in the segregation of populations with reduced dispersive potential (see Moura et al. 2011c).\nPhylogenetic analyses within the \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 clade\n\u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 includes the nominal genera Lafoea Lamouroux, 1821, Acryptolaria Norman, 1875 and Filellum Hincks, 1868 (Fig. 7.3). The \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 clade herein represented includes at least 10 putative species (Figs 7.3 and 7.5), most of these difficult to identify solely based on morphological characters. The taxonomic history of the \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 is complicated. Species-identification depends highly on the presence of reproductive structures, but these are often absent or uninformative. Therefore, 16S haplotype data was crucial to complement phenotypic classifications of \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 species. As in the case of \u2018Zygophylacinae\u2019, the phylogenetic relations between most of the identified species of \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 are not completely resolved with 16S haplotype data, but\nspecies can be fairly easily discriminated when analyzing a phylogram (Figs 7.3 and 7.5).\nT\nFiiellum cf. serrattrm sp, 1 Eslelas, 25-38 m \u2014 WPortugal) FlLELLUMCF.

Abbreviations: Carb., carbonate; Escarp., escarpment; GoC, Gulf of Cadiz; MV, mud volcano; Prov., province.\nRegarding the few well-supported phylogenetic relations between the putative species of \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 outlined (Figs 7.3 and 7.5) we note that one clade of Lafoea (\u2018Lafoea cf. dumosa / sp1 \u2019) consistently grouped with some lineages of Acryptolaria in our analyses (e.g. Figs 7.3 and 7.5). This may suggest that the nominal genera Lafoea and Acryptolaria are polyphyletic. Furthermore, and despite the absence of satisfactory nodal support, the genus Filellum does not seem to be a monophyletic group either, taking into account the genetic divergence (up to 8.2%) and the segregated phylogenetic placement between the three main lineages of Filellum (Figs 7.3 and 7.5).\nGenus Acryptolaria\nFive putative species of Acryptolaria were distinguished by morphological characters (e.g. colonies-growth mode, general appearance of hydrothecae, presence/absence of \u2018diaphragm\u2019, morphometric characters - Table 7.2) and 16S genetic data (Figs 7.3 and 7.5), but their correspondence to described species was questionable in all cases. Three of these species were matched to nominal described taxa (namely Acryptolaria flabellum (Allman, 1888), Acryptolaria crassicaulis (Allman, 1888) and A. conferta), but their type localities are geographically relatively far from the locations of the biological material studied herein. Because tree topologies (Figs 7.3 and 7.5) indicate segregation by geographical distance of the different species outlined, it is suggested that dispersal of Acryptolaria taxa may be highly constrained spatially. Thus, because the potential to find cryptic diversity is high (also due to morphological simplicity), the systematic classifications of the Acryptolaria species herein discriminated remain to be confirmed by further haplotype sampling of nominal species of Acryptolaria closer to their respective type localities.\nThe lack of morphological characters to characterize Acryptolaria species is well recognized (e.g. Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 2007) and taxonomists have relied highly on morphometric characters to differentiate species (c.f. Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 2007). Comparing our phylogenetic reconstructions (Figs 7.3 and 7.5) and morphometric measurements on Acryptolaria specimens (Table 7.2), there is evident concordance between both analyses: -Acryptolaria sp1 has the smaller hydrothecae; - Acryptolaria cf. conferta and Acryptolaria cf. flabellum present hydrothecae of intermediate size but the latter taxon has colonies ramified in one plane; - Acryptolaria sp2 and Acryptolaria cf. crassicaulis are not so\ndivergent molecularly (2-3.1%) and present the largest hydrothecae. Within the latter \u2018group\u2019 with larger hydrothecae, Acryptolaria sp2 and Acryptolaria cf. crassicaulis from Azores are difficult to distinguish morphologically, but the lineage of Acryptolaria cf. crassicaulis from the south of the Azores is somewhat divergent molecularly (1% P distance) from their \u2018conspecifics\u2019 and is the one with the largest hydrothecae (Table 7.2). We highlight however that the sizes of the nematocysts varied too much within lineages and therefore such character is likely useless to diagnose Acryptolaria species (at least the ones presented herein), contrarily to the observations of Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2007).\nTable 7.2: Comparative morphometric data (in gm) of the putative species of Acryptolaria.\nSpecies &amp; Station\tHydrothecae\t\t\t\tNematocysts (large group)\t\n\tAdnate adcauline wall\tFree adcauline wall *\tFree adcauline wall **\tDiameter at rim\tSize ranges\tMean Sizes \u00b1 SD (n=13)\nAcryptolaria cf. conferta\t500 - 550\t230 - 400\t300 - 560\t150 - 190\t\t\nPen Duick Escarp., 498 m - GoC Acryptolaria cf. conferta\t300-520\t320-420\t400-720\t135-190\t\t\nPen Duick Escarp., 557 m - GoC Acryptolaria cf. conferta\t490-650\t260-390\t270-460\t145-190\t22-25 x 8-9\t23.1 \u00b1 0.74 x 8.4 \u00b1 0.45\nNE Mercator MV, 373 m - GoC Acryptolaria cf. conferta\t380-480\t310-400\t360-510\t150-180\t23-25 x 8-9\t23.8 \u00b1 0.7 x 8.2 \u00b1 0.3\nMercator MV, 631 m - GoC Acryptolaria cf. conferta\t410-510\t300-450\t300-680\t150-180\t19-21 x 8\t19.7 \u00b1 0.67 x 8\nNE Mercator MV, 376 m - GoC Acryptolaria cf. conferta\t670-760\t230-430\t230-510\t180-230\t14-15 x 4.5-5\t14.5 \u00b1 0.41 x 4.9 \u00b1 0.19\nPen Duick Escarp., 610 m - GoC Acryptolaria cf. conferta\t540-650\t200-460\t320-515\t175-200\t19-22 x 8-8.2\t20.6 \u00b1 0.72 x 8 \u00b1 0.06\nPen Duick Escarp., 444 m - GoC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAcryptolaria sp1\t440-570\t130-200\t160-230\t170-205\t16.8 - 18 x 6-7\t17.2 \u00b1 0.33 x 6.3 \u00b1 0.38\nPrincess Al.

At\nleast three species of Filellum were identified genetically in our analyses (Figs 7.3 and 7.5), two of each, possibly segregated by depth (one lineage from deep, another from shallow waters), share phenotypic similarities with Filellum serratum- striations on the base of hydrothecae. Filellum cf. serratum from Azores and from the Gulf of Cadiz differ by seven base-pairs (1.4% of divergence) in the generated 16S sequences, and morphologically they also differ substantially by the sizes of the largest nematocysts observed) which appear to be larger in the Azorean lineage (Table 7.3). We refrain in this study to further split these two genetically close haplotypes as different species, and further study of their classification is required in the future. The morphological characters of Fillelum species are few; their measurements (with the probable exception of nematocysts) can be highly variable (e.g. Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 1998; Table 7.3) and do not distinguish between genetically different species (cf. Figs 7.3 and 7.5, and Table 7.3), and therefore are potentially useless to set species apart.\nTable 7.3: Comparative morphometric data (in pm) of the putative species of Filellum.\nSpecies &amp; Station\tHydrothecae\t\t\t\tNematocysts (large group)\t\n\tAdnate adcauline wall\tFree adcauline wall *\tFree adcauline wall **\tDiameter at rim\tSize ranges\tMean Sizes \u00b1 SD\nFilellum cf. serratum / sp.1\t150-330\t230-270\t260-440\t105-170\t18-20 x 4.5-6\t19.55 \u00b1 0.69 x 5.15 \u00b1 0.47\nEstelas, 25-38 m\t(n=4)\t(n=4)\t(n=4)\t(n=6)\t\t(n=10)\n- W Portugal\t252.5 \u00b1 75.9\t250 \u00b1 18.3\t332.5 \u00b1 84.6\t131.7 \u00b1 24.6\t\t\nFilellum cf. serratum / sp.2\t110-250\t180-520\t350-890\t130-165\t7-8 x 2-3\t7.5 \u00b1 0.5 x 2.43 \u00b1 0.35\nMercator MV, 631 m\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t\t(n=7)\n- GoC\t175 \u00b1 51.3\t336 \u00b1 98.1\t609 \u00b1 154.6\t143 \u00b1 13.6\t\t\nFilellum cf. serratum / sp.3\t150-250\t170-550\t260-820\t100-160\t14-15 x3-4\t14.2 \u00b1 0.76 x 3.67 \u00b1 0.58\nS Pico-Faial, ca. 370 m\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t\t(n=3)\n- Azores\t203 \u00b1 31.6\t287 \u00b1 123.4\t400 \u00b1 160.9\t130 \u00b1 22.1\t\t\nFilellum cf. serpens\t120-270\t130-340\t140-430\t120-150\t21-25 x 4.5-6\t23.4 \u00b1 1.15 x 5.2 \u00b1 0.48\nBerlenga, 5-14 m\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t(n=10)\t\t(n=10)\n- W Portugal\t191 \u00b1 47.2\t268 \u00b1 66.3\t325 \u00b1 91.4\t130 \u00b1 11.5\t\t\n* = no renovations ** = with renovations\nGenus Lafoea\nCryptic biodiversity was already encountered within Lafoea dumosa by Moura et al. (2008). These authors found two genetically divergent clades of hydroids classified as Lafoea dumosa. In the present study we substantially increased the haplotype representation for this nominal species, and now at least three different species classified under L. dumosa can be distinguished genetically (Figs 7.3 and 7.5). Taxonomy of L. dumosa has been widely debated until Cornelius (1975), who established the synonymy of all described species morphologically similar to Lafoea dumosa, namely Lafoea cornuta\n(Lamouroux, 1821), Lafoea pocillum Hincks, 1868, Lafoea gracillima (Alder, 1856) and Lafoea fruticosa (Sars, 1850). Before Cornelius (1975), hydrozoan researchers (e.g. Vervoort, 1972; Millard, 1975) generally accepted as valid species in that complex only L. fruticosa and L. dumosa, differing by the presence or absence of pedicels in the hydrothecae, respectively. Shuchert (2001) found substantial differences in the sizes of nematocysts related to the \u2018varieties\u2019 with pedicellate or stalkless hydrothecae, and pointed out that Fleming\u2019s original description of L. dumosa likely corresponded to a form with stalked hydrothecae, contrary to what had been widely assumed (e.g. Cornelius 1975). Despite suspecting that two separate species were included within L. dumosa, Shuchert (2001) refrained from splitting species without other sources of data, such as mitochondrial DNA sequences. In the present study, we have indeed verified that specimens with apedicellate hydrothecae collected in shallow waters of Portugal, correspond to a species distinct from the specimens with pedicellate hydrothecae, herein represented by deep-water organisms (Figs 7.3 and 7.5). The larger nematocysts of the species with stalkless hydrothecae are also considerably smaller than those of the morphs with pedicellate hydrothecae (in accordance with Schuchert 2001; see Table 7.4). Regarding the \u2018L. dumosa\" with pedicels in hydrothecae, we found two distinct lineages (Moura et al. 2008; Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. 2010) distantly related by 16S data (up to 5 % of sequence divergence between clades), which we believe corresponds to at least two genetically distinct species (Figs 7.3 and 7.5). Both putative \u2018species\u2019 were found to co-occur in close proximity at bathyal depths of the Gulf of Cadiz. One of these \u2018species\u2019 was recorded only in three localities of the Gulf of Cadiz (two haplotypes diverging only by one base-pair) including one mud volcano; the other was found at geographically distant localities including the Gulf of Cadiz, Iceland and Antarctica. Not surprisingly, these showed relatively high sequence divergence between samples (genetic distances of 1.8, 2.7 and 3.1 %) (Figs 7.3 and 7.5). Therefore, we strongly suspect that further cryptic diversity might be associated with this main lineage of \u2018L. dumosa', and that gene flow in these animals is likely limited in deep waters. It is also noteworthy that no substantial morphological differences were detected between the two main lineages of pedicellate \u2018L. dumosa', including in the sizes of the largest nematocyst types (see Table 7.4). While it seems imperative to re-split taxa within the nominal L. dumosa based on the hypotheses and arguments discussed here, further haplotype sampling is required, especially in the immediate vicinity of the type\nlocalities of the described species and varieties presently in the synonymy of L. dumosa, before conclusions can be reached.\nTable 7.4: Comparative morphometric data of cnidocysts (in pm) of the putative species of Lafoea.\nSpecies &amp; Station\tNematocysts (large group)\t\n\tSize ranges\tMean Sizes \u00b1 SD\nLafoea cf dumosa / sp.1\t11.5-13 x 4.7-5\t12.45 \u00b1 0.6 x 4.97 \u00b1 0.09\nS\u00e3o Torpes, 9-13 m\t\t(n=10)\nLafoea cf dumosa / sp2\t22-25 x 9-10.5\t23.5 \u00b1 0.95 x 9.7 \u00b1 0.44\nCarb.

Another genetically close haplotype of that putative species, far less common than the other haplotype of the Gulf of Cadiz, was found only once at one sampling station (444 meters) also in this region (Figs 7.3 and 7.5). Acryptolaria cf. conferta is a highly abundant and widespread species in the deep waters in the Gulf of Cadiz. The low genotypic diversity encountered for this species may reflect the effect of its large population sizes, which should be also interconnected with the large dispersal capability of the species, at least regionally. The other \u2018Lafoeinae\u2019 species represented are not so frequently found at neighboring sampling localities, probably because of relatively smaller population sizes and reduced dispersal capacity for those taxa. These life history traits coupled with the effects of oceanic currents, seafloor features (like seamounts, mud volcanoes and extensive abyssal plains) and in some cases glacial cycles (see Moura et al. 2011c), may explain the much higher sequence divergence amongst conspecific specimens and potential for cryptic diversity.\n7.4\tCONCLUSIONS\nAs a final conclusion, the 16S sequence data when analyzed conjunctively with morphologic and sampling data, proved to be extremely useful to rectify or refine many taxonomic classifications and phylogenetic/phylogeographic assumptions of difficult to resolve hydrozoan taxa like the Lafoeidae s. l. or Hebellidae s. l.. The present study provided several new and important insights into the systematics of those groups, which deserve further investigation and comprehensive taxonomic work to resolve nominal species, genera and even families.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe acknowledge the invitations for the participation of MRC and other CESAM members in the Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea cruises.

The systematics of the group has, however, been controversial and dedicated molecular analyses are lacking. We therefore analysed existing and new 16S rRNA sequences of Aglaopheniidae, in a total of 98 16S sequences corresponding to 25 putative species (25 nominal and three undescribed) from seven genera. The monophyly of the subfamilies Gymnangiinae and Aglaopheniinae, and tribes\nAglaopheniini and Cladocarpini were not verified with 16S sequence data. The genera Gymnangium and Aglaophenia can only be considered valid if both Gymnangium gracicaule and Aglaophenia latecarinata are removed from their respective genera. The phenotypically similar Cladocarpus and Streptocaulus are probably monophyletic and clearly distinct genetically. The genus Lytocarpia may be polyphyletic. The nominal species Aglaophenia pluma, Aglaophenia tubiformis and Aglaophenia octodonta are likely conspecific, as are also the species Aglaophenia acacia and Aglaophenia elongata. The 16S data revealed the existence of two potentially unnamed species of Aglaophenia respectively from the Azores and Madeira. The phylogeographic structure of the taxa with the greatest representation of haplotypes from the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean, revealed the influence of Mediterranean waters in Madeira and the Azores, and gene flow between deep waters of the Mediterranean and Atlantic. The last glaciations in Europe may have caused genetic bottlenecks but also high intraspecific haplotype diversity. Finally, Macrorhynchia philippina was detected in samples from Madeira and possibly represents an invasive species.\n8.1\tINTRODUCTION\nMarine hydroids (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) are important components of coastal and deep-sea benthic habitats, being some of the most important sessile predators and competitors for bottom space (e.g. Bouillon et al. 2006). However, despite their importance in marine ecosystems, the scientific study of these animals has been highly neglected and their systematic relations are contentious and poorly resolved largely because of their morphological simplicity and plasticity.\nSome of the more frequent and prominent hydroids found worldwide in shallow and deep waters belong to the cosmopolitan family Aglaopheniidae Agassiz, 1862. The Aglaopheniidae comprise about 250 valid species included within eight genera (Bouillon et al. 2006). Colonies of Aglaopheniidae are passive suspension feeders with colonies having a typical appearance of feathers (see examples of Fig. 8.1).\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses of Leclere et al. (2007), Moura et al. (2008), Leclere et al. (2009) and Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2010) have all recovered the family Aglaopheniidae as monophyletic with a maximum number of 16 nominal species and five genera of aglaopheniids represented. These authors also confirmed that the Aglaopheniidae belongs to the superfamily Plumularoidea. Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2010) found that the Schizotrichidae are likely to be the most closely related group to the Aglaopheniidae. At an intra-family level Leclere et al. (2007) and Moura et al. (2008) found the genus Gymnangium Hincks, 1874 to be polyphyletic and the genus Aglaophenia Lamouroux, 1812 monophyletic. All other genera were insufficiently represented in their molecular phylogenetic analyses to investigate their relationships. Moura et al. (2008) further highlighted the possibility that the nominal species Aglaophenia pluma (Linnaeus, 1767), Aglaophenia octodonta Nutting, 1900 and Aglaophenia tubiformis Marktanner-Turneretscher, 1890 are conspecific, the name Aglaophenia pluma having priority.\nFig. 8.1. Examples of Aglaopheniidae colonies: (A) Gymnangium montagui off Berlengas - west Portugal; (B) Macrorhynchia philippina off Madeira Island; (C) Undetermined Aglaophenia species off Madeira Island. Credits: C.J. Moura.\nBased on morphological characters, Calder (1997) ordered the genera of Aglaopheniidae into two subfamilies: Gymnangiinae Calder, 1997, in which the gonothecae (reproductive structures) are unprotected, and Aglaopheniinae Marktanner-Turneretscher, 1890, in which the gonothecae are protected by \u2018phylactocarps\u2019 or \u2018corbulae\u2019 . Calder (1997), based on the structure of the reproductive organs, further subdivided the subfamily Aglaopheniinae into two tribes: the Aglaopheniini Marktanner-Turneretscher, 1890, and the Cladocarpini Calder, 1997. However, these subdivisions of\nthe family Aglaopheniidae were never tested genetically because of insufficient haplotype representation of these groups in molecular phylogenetic analyses.\nIn the present study, the number of taxa of Aglaopheniidae represented by 16S mRNA haplotypes was increased considerably with the main aim to test phylogenetic relations within the family, including the monophyletic status, of its subfamilies, tribes, genera, and species. 16S rDNA data may also help to understand phylogeographical relations of aglaopheniids in the north-east Atlantic and west Mediterranean as this gene resolves some level of intraspecific variation in other hydroid taxa (e.g. Moura et al. 2008, 2011a, c, d). The utility of the 16S sequence data for \u2018DNA barcoding\u2019 purposes in the hydroids of Aglaopheniidae is also assessed.\n8.2\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCollection and identification of samples\nSpecimens of Aglaopheniidae were collected from 57 distinct sampling sites of various shallow and deep-water localities of the northern Atlantic and western Mediterranean (Fig. 8.2, Table 8.1). Specimens were fixed and preserved mostly in 96% ethanol, although sometimes in 70% ethanol. The material collected in deep waters of the Azores and Madeira included specimens obtained as part of a study on by-catch from deepsea fisheries and some were frozen prior to fixation in ethanol. Taxa were classified taxonomically in the laboratory by C. J. Moura mainly based on the publications of Cornelius (1995), Svoboda &amp; Cornelius (1991), Ramil &amp; Vervoort (1992, 2004), Medel &amp; Vervoort (1995), Ramil et al. (1998) and Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. (2001).\nDNA extraction, amplification and sequencing\nProtocols for DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (16S) rDNA gene followed the methodology described in Moura et al. (2008), except that the volume of reagents used in PCR reactions was reduced by half, and some of the purified PCR products were sent to \u2018 STAB VIDA, Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Servi\u00e7os\nFig. 8.2. Map of the north-east Atlantic and west Mediterranean with representation of the sites with Aglaopheniidae haplotypes sampled specifically for this study.\nem Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas, Lda', Oeiras, Portugal for sequencing. The primers used were SHA\t(ACGGAATGAACTCAAATCATGT)\tand\tSHB\n(TCGACTGTTTACCAAAAACATA) (Cunningham &amp; Buss 1993). The skeletons of voucher specimens were mounted in permanent slides and deposited in the Museu Nacional de Hist\u00f3ria Natural, Lisbon, Portugal. The material from the Portuguese coast and Gulf of Cadiz is temporarily deposited in the Biological Research Collection of the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro (DBUA), Portugal. Specimens from Madeira remained in the Municipal Museum collection at the Marine Biology Station of Funchal, Portugal. Azorean specimens gathered by the Department of Oceanography and Fisheries (DOP), University of the Azores, Portugal, were returned to that institution. Sampling details, GenBank and Museum accession numbers are described in Table 8.1.\nPhylogenetic analyses\nThe sequences assembled for this study were clustered with sequences of Aglaopheniidae published on GenBank. They were then aligned in MEGA version 4 (Tamura et al. 2007) with CLUSTALW using the default alignment settings, and trimmed to the shortest sequence. MrModeltest version 2.3 (Nylander 2004) was used to determine the optimal probabilistic model of sequence evolution. The \u2018general time reversible plus gamma' was the model selected by the Akaike Information Criterion. Maximum likelihood\n(ML) phylogenetic analyses were performed through the PHYML website (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml) (Guindon &amp; Gascuel 2003) using the GTR model. Bayesian analyses were also performed with MrBayes v3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist 2001), using again the same model. The search was run for 107 generations, with trees sampled every 1000 generations (the first 1 million generations were discarded as \u2018burnin\u2019). Clade stability was assessed using non-parametric bootstrapping of ML analyses (1000 replicates) and Bayesian posterior probability values. MEGA version 4 (Tamura et al. 2007) was used to calculate pairwise distances for simple comparisons of percentage sequence divergence between taxa.\n8.3\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA total of 98 16S mRNA sequences (comprising 60 haplotypes) of Aglaopheniidae, with 566 base pairs (298 parsimony informative sites, ts/tv ratio =1.48), were analysed phylogenetically; 66 sequences out of the 98 were determined specifically for the present study. Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2010) found that the most likely sister group of the Aglaopheniidae is the family Schizotrichidae Pe\u00f1a Cantero, Sentandreu &amp; Latorre, 2010. For this reason, sequences of Schizotricha Allman, 1883 were used as an outgroup in the present phylogenetic reconstructions (Fig. 8.3). As in the phylogenetic hypotheses of Leclere et al. (2007, 2009), Moura et al. (2008) and Pe\u00f1a Cantero et al. (2010), the family Aglaopheniidae is monophyletic with high nodal support (Fig. 8.3). Within Aglaopheniidae four main divergent clades were recovered: (1) species of Cladocarpus Allman, 1874 and Aglaophenopsis Fewkes, 1881; (2) Streptocaulus Allman, 1883, species; (3) Gymnangium hians (Busk, 1852) and Gymnangium montagui (Billard, 1912); and (4) Gymnangium gracilicaule (Jaderholm, 1903) with species of Aglaophenia, Macrorhynchia Kirchenpauer, 1872 and Lytocarpia Kirchenpauer, 1872 (Fig. 8.3). The only statistically supported phylogenetic relationship between these main evolutionary branches is that between species of Gymnangium (i.e. G. hians and G. montagui) and Streptocaulus (Fig. 8.3). The present study therefore does not support the subdivision of the Aglaopheniidae into the subfamilies Gymnangiinae and Aglaopheniinae, and the latter nominal group into\n<|81\n_________________________r Schizotncha turqueti A. nta rcti c a 1 n i rrr d n 11 d\nL Schizotricha nana A nta rcti c a\tJ uuiukuuk\n\u2014 C. integer Raunefjord-Norway\t1\n-C.paraformosus Canyon,ca. 2000m-Greenland j uiaaocarpus\ni Ag. cartieri Azores Bank, 307 m-Azores 1 TT&lt;\u00bfft cartieri Azores Bank, 402 m - Azores T Agiaopnenopsis _ J_________*1* jS. multisefjtatusM ercajor MV, 353m - GuIf of Cadiz _\nft J ft\n\n94|*\n\n=|91\nr\n95|* -k 95|*\nS. dohfusi NE Mercator MV, 432 m - Gulf of Cadiz\nS. dohfusi Carbonate province, 461 m- Gulf of Cadiz \u25a0\nS. dohfusi Mellila mound, 300 m-Alboran Sea\nS. dohfusi Granada MV, 600 m-Alboran Sea p r----------G. hians Andaman Sea-Thailand\n\u2014 G. montagui Lundyislandu5-40 m - UK\n_._____..\t___ _____________________Portugal\nG. montagui Sines, 15-20 m- SW Portugal\nG. montagui Esteias, 15-26 m - W Portugal G. montagui Pe Sagres, 2-22 m - S Portugal\nJ__i\u2014 L.sp.

The branch length indicator represents 0.1 substitutions per site.\nthe tribes Aglaopheniini and Cladocarpini, as proposed by Calder (1997) based on the morphology of reproductive structures. The genetic distinctiveness of the clade containing G. hians and G. montagui (Fig. 8.3) may support the demarcation of the subfamily Gymnangiinae, but the placement of G. gracilicaule closer to Macrorhynchia species indicates that the diagnostic character established for Gymnangiinae (gonothecae unprotected) is not valid and that unprotected gonothecae arose independently in the evolutionary history of Aglaopheniidae. The subfamily Gymnangiinae may therefore be considered a valid group that excludes the taxon \u2018Gymnangium\u2019 gracilicaule. The monophyletic status of the subfamily Aglaopheniinae, and of its tribes Aglaopheniini and Cladocarpini was also not verified.\nWithin Aglaopheniidae two of the seven genera represented (Gymnangium and Aglaophenia) were recovered as polyphyletic (Fig. 8.3). The genera Cladocarpus and Streptocaulus, represented by two species each (none of which were the type of the respective genus), are recovered as monophyletic. The monophyletic nature of the genera Macrorhynchia and Lytocarpia cannot be refuted at the present time (Fig. 8.3) because nodal support is low for the clades encompassing representatives of each genus.\nThe eastern Atlantic species G. montagui clusters tightly on a distinct evolutionary branch with G. hians collected from Thailand, but the 16S sequence of Gymnangium gracilicaule from Madagascar is found in another clade more closely related to Macrorhynchia species. Therefore the genus Gymnangium can be considered polyphyletic (Leclere et al. 2007; Moura et al. 2008; Fig. 8.3). The representatives of Macrorhynchia may form a monophyletic group that together with \u2018 Gymnangium\u2019 gracilicaule comprise a sister clade to species of Aglaophenia and Lytocarpia (Fig. 8.3).\nThe diagnostic characters of the genera Cladocarpus and Streptocaulus have been much debated, as some species possess phenotypic characteristics of both nominal genera and others possess none of them (e.g. Calder 1997; Schuchert 2001; Bouillon et al. 2006). Our phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 8.3), although still limited by under-representation of taxa of these genera, recover both genera monophyletic and genetically quite divergent (genetic distance of 23-26% between taxa of both genera). However, neither the type species of the genus Streptocaulus (= Streptocaulus pulcherrimus Allman, 1883) nor the type species of\nCladocarpus (= Cladocarpus formosus Allman, 1874a) were included in our molecular analyses in order to extrapolate the monophyletic status of both genera. However, species of Streptocaulus and Cladocarpus cluster into two quite separated clades, suggesting that both genera could coincide with two distinct clades. This result also provide support to the hypothesis of Ramil &amp; Vervoort (2008) that Streptocaulus multiseptatus (Bale, 1915) belongs to the genus Streptocaulus (instead of Cladocarpus), according to the morphology of the phylactocarps (modified hydrocladia that protect the gonothecae). The genus Streptocaulus [represented by Streptocaulus dollfusi (Billard, 1924) and S. multiseptatus] form a separate divergent clade that is sister to the genus Gymnangium (Fig. 8.3). The genus Cladocarpus [represented by Cladocarpus paraformosus Schuchert, 2000 and Cladocarpus integer (G.O. Sars, 1874)] forms a clade sister to Aglaophenopsis cartieri (Bedot, 1921) (Fig. 8.3), previously classified in the genus Cladocarpus until Ramil &amp; Vervoort (2004) transferred it to Aglaophenopsis (genetic distance of 12-13% between both clades). Our analyses did not clarify if the clade containing Aglaophenopsis cartieri and Cladocarpus is sister to the clade with Gymnangium and Streptocaulus, or instead to the evolutionary branch containing \u2018Gymnangium\u2019 gracilicaule and species of Aglaophenia and Lytocarpia (Fig. 8.3).\nThe genus Lytocarpia herein represented by three species comprises two main clades with uncertain phylogenetic relationships: one clade contains the nominal species Lytocarpia myriophyllum (Linnaeus, 1758), the other (genetically divergent from the latter by 10-11 %) includes Lytocarpia phyteuma (Kirchenpauer, 1876) and an undetermined species of Lytocarpia from Madagascar. Such a result may indicate a polyphyletic status for the genus Lytocarpia.\nThe genus Aglaophenia is recovered as polyphyletic because the sequence of Aglaophenia latecarinata Allman, 1877, lies outside of all other Aglaophenia taxa, which themselves cluster into a well-supported group (Fig. 8.3). It is unlikely that the sequence of Aglaophenia latecarinata Allman, 1877 may correspond to a misidentification or contamination (A. Lindner &amp; E. Migotto, pers. communication), and therefore, the genus Aglaophenia is monophyletic only with the exclusion of A. latecarinata. The genus Aglaophenia is very common in the shallow and deep waters of the NE Atlantic (Moura, pers. observ.) and all the eleven nominal species of Aglaophenia reported for European and Mediterranean waters are represented in our phylogeny (Fig. 8.3; sensu Svoboda &amp;\nCornelius 1991). Additionally to these species, our phylogenetic hypotheses (Fig. 8.3) also confirmed the presence of two (possibly new undescribed) species: one that was found widespread in coastal waters of southern Madeira, the other present in the bathyal depths of the Azores. None of these two new species revealed any particular phylogenetic relation with other Aglaophenia species (Fig. 8.3), further suggesting their distinctiveness. Morphologically, the deep-water species from the Azores can be distinguished by the pronounced intrathecal septum and the more protruding mesial nematotheca (Fig. 8.4A), whereas the taxon from Madeira is peculiar by the prominent mesial tooth of the hydrotheca and the fusion of the mesial nematotheca up to the middle of the abcauline wall of hydrothecae (Fig. 8.4B). These morphological characteristics lend further support to the specific distinctness of these two clades (Fig. 8.4).\nMesial tooth of hydrothecal rim\nIntrathecal septum\nV\nMesial nematothecae\nFig. 8.4. Hydrothecae of Aglaophenia species revealed as distinct by genetic data: (A) Aglaophenia sp1 from deep waters of the Azores; (B) Aglaophenia sp2 from coastal waters of Madeira Island. Scale bars: 0.1 mm. Credits: C.J. Moura.\nFew phylogenetic relationships amongst Aglaophenia species are well supported by\n16S haplotype data (Fig. 8.3). However, it is worth mention that Aglaophenia elongata and\nAglaophenia acacia share the same 16S haplotype (Fig. 8.3), raising the possibility of\nsynonymy of these morphologically similar nominal species. Furthermore, the predictions of Moura et al. (2008) that Aglaophenia tubiformis, Aglaophenia octodonta and Aglaophenia pluma are synonymous nominal species are confirmed (Fig. 8.5). This is because specimens presenting the supposedly morphologic diagnostic characters of these three \u2018species' (according to the taxonomic key by Svoboda &amp; Cornelius 1991) do not form reciprocal phylogenetic clusters (Fig. 8.5). All the different lineages identified within that complex of three nominal species (with maximal genetic distance of 2 % between its haplotypes) seem to rather be segregated by geographical region (see Fig. 8.5). We therefore conclude that if any species need to be split within the Aglaophenia pluma complex, new diagnostic criteria will have to be found. Also note that Aglaophenia harpago Von Schenck, 1965, which is an endemic species from the Mediterranean, and inhabits exclusively the leaves of the seagrasses (Posidonia and Cymodocea) outgroup and cluster tightly with the complex of Aglaophenia pluma (with interspecific genetic distance of 1.1-2.5 %) (Fig. 8.5). However, despite the morphological resemblance between the two taxa, Aglaophenia harpago is recovered as monophyletic (Fig. 8.5) and therefore we do not question its validity on the basis of the evidence presented here.\n0.01\nSubst ./Site\nA. harpago Giglio Island-Italy ) , , r \u25a0 ,\n} Aglsophmishtrptgo\n----- /I. octodonta S.

Numbers near the nodes indicate the values of bootstrap (left) and posterior probabilities (right) in percentages.

The branch length indicator represents 0.1 substitutions per site.\nThe intraspecific sequence variation of nominal species of Aglaopheniidae, is usually relatively low (maximum of 2 % for A. parvula) and the species Gymnangium montagui, Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri, Macrorhynchia philippina (Kirchenpauer, 1872) and Streptocaulus dollfusi present no intraspecific divergence amongst specimens from relatively far geographical locations (Fig. 8.3).\nFor G. montagui the same 16S haplotype is shared between coastal waters of Portugal (from south to north) and southern UK (Fig. 8.3). A relatively similar pattern is detected for Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri that presents the same haplotype in specimens from central Portugal, southern U.K and from the peaks of the Gorringe Bank (Fig. 8.3). Geographical distributions of both G. montagui and A. kirchenpaueri are restricted to shallow waters of the eastern Atlantic (and also west Mediterranean for Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri) (e.g. Ansin Agis et al. 2001) and therefore these species may have a fairly recent origin and/or suffered recent genetic bottlenecks, reasons that may explain the presence of identical genetic sequences amongst such distant geographical locations. Nevertheless we cannot discount the possibility of recent effective gene flow amongst the localities for which we obtained haplotype data for these two species. Large population sizes and/or oceanic currents or even possibly a slow rate of genetic evolution for these two species may be responsible for such genetic homogeneity.\nMacrorhynchia philippina is considered a circumglobal species present in tropical and subtropical oceanic waters (e.g. see Ansin Agis et al. 2001). The presence of the same 16S haplotype for this species in Brazil and Madeira (Fig. 8.3) is remarkable. M. philippina develops prominent colonies that have potential to be very abundant locally (Moura, pers. observ.). Although the hypotheses mentioned above to explain the sharing of the same 16S haplotypes in G. montagui and Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri may be valid for M. philippina, we hypothesize that this species may be more likely to have been introduced via transport on ship-hulls or in ballast waters and became invasive in Madeira. This hypothesis is supported by the apparent absence of M. philippina in the archipelagos of Selvagens and Azores (Moura, pers. observ.). Furthermore, Zenetos et al. (2011) also considered M. philippina to be a well-established alien species in the eastern Mediterranean.\nFor S. dollfusi we detected the same 16S haplotype in deep waters of the Alboran Sea (west Mediterranean) and Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 8.3), which probably represents recent\n(or fairly recent) gene flow between both deep-water areas, analogous to what was found in other bathyal hydroids by Moura et al. (2011c, d).\nOther phylogeographic associations can be also detected in other taxa, for which a higher representation of haplotypes were obtained, namely for Aglaophenia parvula, Aglaophenia picardi, Aglaophenia lophocarpa, Aglaophenia tubulifera, and for the Aglaopheniapluma complex (Fig. 8.3).\nFor Aglaophenia parvula two genetically relatively distant haplotypes (with 2 % sequence divergence) were encountered: one from South Africa, the other distributed from the western to the south-western Portuguese coast (Fig. 8.3). It thus seems likely that gene flow may have ceased between Portugal and South Africa for Aglaophenia parvula, and that presently gene flow likely occurs between the Portuguese locations from where the species was collected.\nTwo close haplotypes of Aglaophenia picardi were detected (Fig. 8.3), one of which was shared amongst three Azorean islands (S\u00e3o Miguel, Faial and Flores), Madeira and the western Mediterranean. This may result from the influence of Mediterranean waters on these Atlantic islands (e.g. similarly to patterns revealed in molluscs by \u00c1vila 2000).\nFor Aglaophenia lophocarpa five haplotypes were found in a relatively small geographical area. One of these, although apparently more common in the Gulf of Cadiz, was also detected in a mud volcano of the Alboran Sea (similar to the pattern described for S. dollfusi) (Fig. 8.3). One haplotype of Aglaophenia lophocarpa was exclusively found in a carbonate mound of the Alboran Sea whereas the other three haplotypes of that species were discovered at different bathyal locations of the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 8.3). The wide habitat heterogeneity at bathyal depths of the Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea, coupled with past variation in oceanographic conditions, may have promoted the observed high levels of genetic diversity for Aglaophenia lophocarpa (see Moura et al. 2011c for Nemertesia species in the Gulf of Cadiz).\nSeven 16S haplotypes of Aglaophenia tubulifera were detected in shallow and deep-water specimens from very distant geographical areas, including the coastal waters of Portugal, the UK, and deep waters of the Azores and Gulf of Cadiz. In the Azores, Aglaophenia tubulifera was detected only in deep waters (Moura, pers. observ.) and the four haplotypes represented from that geographical area seem to be more related to each\nother in comparison to the haplotypes from other locations. This provides sound evidence that Aglaophenia tubulifera arrived in the Azorean archipelago via deep waters, and that the genetic divergence observed in specimens from that area (Fig. 8.3) might be a consequence of the isolation by distance from other suitable habitats and/or currenttopography interactions of the seamounts leading to larval retention. The other deep-water haplotype of Aglaophenia tubulifera represented is from the Gulf of Cadiz and is apparently more related to shallow-water specimens of European waters rather than to the deep-water samples from the Azores (Fig. 8.3). The two shallow-water haplotypes of Aglaophenia tubulifera: one present in central and northern Portugal, and another from southern UK, diverge little from the deep-water conspecifics represented (Fig. 8.3). Therefore Aglaophenia tubulifera constitutes a good example of a species effectively present in both shallow and deep waters.\nWithin the complex of Aglaophenia pluma (also comprising the nominal species Aglaophenia octodonta and Aglaophenia tubiformis) 17 closely related haplotypes were detected (Fig. 8.5). As previously stated, the segregation of haplotypes within this complex seems to be correlated to their geographical origin rather than to the classification into morphotypes of the nominal species Aglaophenia pluma, Aglaophenia octodonta, and Aglaophenia tubiformis (Fig. 8.5). Two related haplotypes, slightly more divergent from others of the established complex, are respectively from the Central and Eastern group of the Azorean islands (sampling sites are: Pico-Faial channel and S\u00e3o Miguel) (Fig. 8.5). Another clade, with four closely related haplotypes, corresponds to specimens from the three Azorean groups of islands (Central, Eastern and Western) and one from the Mediterranean (Fig. 8.5); again revealing the influence of Mediterranean waters in the Azorean archipelago (as suggested above for Aglaophenia picardi). A haplotype from Madeira does not reveal any particular association with other specimens of the complex represented (Fig. 8.5). Another clade of the Aglaopheniapluma complex is represented by nine haplotypes: two from the Mediterranean, two from the southern UK (one of these is also present in southern Portugal), one from north-west France, four from southern Portugal, and another from central Portugal (Fig. 8.5). Such high levels of intraspecific variability within the Aglaophenia pluma complex seem to be relatively recent and may possibly reflect the effects of the past glaciations that impacted Europe (similarly to the results also found for Nemertesia and Plumularia species by Moura et al. 2011c).\nFinally, some specimens collected specifically for the present study increase the known geographical and bathymetrical range of some species herein reported. For the first time Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri has been recorded from the Gorringe Bank, S. multiseptatus is found in the Gulf of Cadiz, L. myriophyllum has been recorded in the Alboran Sea, and C. paraformosus, previously known only from one locality (905 m depth) off the northern coast of Iceland (Schuchert, 2000), has now been recorded in the waters of Greenland at about 2000 m. The deepest bathymetric record of S. dollfusi has also been extended from 380 m (Billard 1934) to 600 m; Aglaophenopsis cartieri had its shallowest bathymetrical record at 318 m (Bedot 1921) and has been herein recorded at 307 m, and G. montagui that was only known from a maximum depth of 20 m (Medel &amp; Vervoort 1995) was herein found at depths of around 30 m.\n8.4\tCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study analysed 98 Aglaopheniidae sequences (68 of which were new) of the mitochondrial gene 16S rRNA, corresponding to 25 putative species (25 nominal and three undescribed) of seven nominal genera. The family Aglaopheniidae was recovered as monophyletic with four divergent and well-supported main clades that rejected the monophyly of the subfamilies Gymnangiinae and Aglaopheniinae, and tribes Aglaopheniini and Cladocarpini as recently proposed by Calder (1997) based on the morphology of reproductive structures. The four main evolutionary branches found within Aglaopheniidae are: (1) Streptocaulus species; (2) G. hians and G. montagui, that may demarcate the subfamily Gymnangiinae; (3) Cladocarpus and Aglaophenopsis species; and (4) G. gracilicaule with species of Aglaophenia, Macrorhynchia and Lytocarpia. Despite being genetically distinct, the first two aforementioned clades cluster together; the other two clades have uncertain phylogenetic relationships within Aglaopheniidae. Note however that the 16S is a fast-evolving marker and may not be the most appropriate to resolve phylogenetic relationships above the taxonomic level of genus. Therefore the above-mentioned phylogenetic relations of Aglaopheniidae at high taxonomic ranks are\nprovisional (but in agreement with phylogenetic hypotheses of Lecl\u00e8re et al. 2009), and further genetic sampling is required.\nThe Aglaopheniidae genera Gymnangium and Aglaophenia were found to be monophyletic only with the exclusion and taxonomic revision of the biological material represented by the sequences of G. gracicaule and Aglaophenia latecarinata, respectively for each genus. The genera Cladocarpus and Streptocaulus, although not represented in this study by the type species of both genera, were recovered as monophyletic, and clearly distinct genetically from each other, despite their morphological resemblances. The monophyletic nature of the genera Macrorhynchia and Lytocarpia was not refuted because of highly divergent clades among these genera and because of the consequent low nodal support involved with their corresponding lineages. The genus Aglaophenopsis represented only by Aglaophenopsis cartieri was genetically distinct from the sister genus Cladocarpus.\nThe genus Aglaophenia was the best-characterized in our analyses with representatives of all the 11 species known from European and Mediterranean waters (sensu Svoboda &amp; Cornelius 1991), Aglaophenia latecarinata, plus two undescribed species (possibly new to science): one from shallow waters of Madeira, the other from deep waters of the Azores. Apart from Aglaophenia latecarinata, all other species of Aglaophenia cluster together and are easily distinguished in a phylogram and by the monophyly of species with concordant morphological diagnostic characters. However, the nominal species Aglaophenia pluma, Aglaophenia tubiformis and Aglaophenia octodonta were not recognized as monophyletic and share very small genetic distances, suggesting that these may be conspecific. In case of established synonymy, the name A. pluma has priority (Moura et al. 2008). Specimens referred in Lecl\u00e8re et al. (2009) to A. acacia and A. elongata, using material identified by A. Svoboda, share the same 16S haplotypes and therefore are likely to be conspecific. Within the genus Aglaophenia, the only other interspecific relationship investigated was that between Aglaophenia harpago and the complex of Aglaopheniapluma, that are very close genetically.\nThe relatively good haplotype representation obtained for certain taxa also highlighted phylogeographical associations in coastal and deep waters of the north-east Atlantic and the west Mediterranean. Probable evidence of recent gene flow, supported by shared 16S sequences, were revealed between the following localities: (1) the southern UK\nand southern and central Portugal (for G. montagui and Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri); (2) southern and western Portugal (for Aglaophenia parvula); (3) western and northern Portugal (for Aglaophenia tubulifera); (4) Azorean islands (S\u00e3o Miguel, Faial, and Flores), Madeira, and the western Mediterranean (for Aglaophenia picardi); (5) deep waters of the Alboran Sea and Gulf of Cadiz (for S. dollfusi and Aglaophenia lophocarpa). The presence of the same 16S genotype of M. philippina in Brazil and Madeira was interpreted as the result of an unintentional introduction of that species in Madeira possibly by shipping, whereas the phylogeographical patterns verified for G. montagui and Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri may be associated to fairly recent origins and/or recent genetic bottlenecks perhaps enhanced by the last glacial cycle that affected Europe. The phylogeographical patterns verified for Aglaophenia picardi, and to some extent for the Aglaophenia pluma complex, probably reveal the influence of oceanic currents in the relatively recent gene flow amongst shallow waters of the Mediterranean, Madeira, and the Azores.\nRelatively high haplotype diversity was encountered in the Gulf of Cadiz (e.g. for Aglaophenia lophocarpa) and coastal European waters (e.g. for Aglaophenia pluma). The latter may be explained by the effects of previous glaciations in the Northern hemisphere causing fragmentation of populations followed by secondary contact. The former may be explained by the consequence of the habitat heterogeneity and complex oceanographic settings in the Gulf of Cadiz.\nFinally the 16S sequence data were consistent with the morphologically defined species and indicated the existence of two unnamed species and the possible conspecificity of two species groups. The partial 16S gene sequence is therefore suitable as a \u2018DNA barcode\u2019 marker for aglaopheniids. Further genetic representation of the other species of this diverse family should resolve problems of synonymy and other doubts in taxonomic assignment, and should also clarify the true diagnostic morphological characters for species and genera. Greater sampling of haplotypes from other localities and the calibration of the \u2018molecular clock\u2019 of the 16S gene for the Aglaopheniidae will also probably contribute to a better understanding of the actual diversity in oceans and of past events such as alterations in the circulation of water currents and the effects of climatic change.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the invitations for the participation of MRC and other CESAM members in the Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea cruises. The on board support of the cochief scientists L. Pinheiro and M. Ivanov (TTR cruises, Training Through Research Programme, IOC-UNESCO), O. Pfannkuche (Maria S.

These colonies are abundant and ecologically important in both shallow and deep waters worldwide. Here we analyse the systematics of most Nemertesia species from the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean using morphology and phylogenetic inferences of 16S rRNA haplotype data. Phylogeographical analysis revealed multiple movements of taxa to and from the Mediterranean after the Messinian salinity crisis through shallow and deep waters. The nominal species Nemertesia belini and Nemertesia antennina revealed multiple genetic lineages representing cryptic species diversity. Molecular phylogenetic evidence was supported by consistent phenotypic differences\nbetween lineages and three and seven putative species were resolved within the N. belini and N. antennina complexes respectively. Three putative species of the N. antennina complex found at different seamounts of the Azores grouped in a clade clustered amongst the other four cryptic species present at neighbouring bathyal localities of the Gulf of Cadiz. These cryptic species, mostly from the deep sea, form a clade distantly related to the typical N. antennina from European coastal waters. Depth or environmental correlates of depth seem to influence the reproductive strategies of Nemertesia colonies and ultimately speciation. In particular, speciation of these hydroids must have been influenced by hydrography, habitat heterogeneity, isolation by distance and larval dispersal capacity. The deep sea is shown as an important environment in the generation and accumulation of lineages that may occasionally invade coastal waters in the NE Atlantic. Glacial cycles of cooling, along with changes in sea level, and eradication of some coastal faunas likely facilitated speciation and evolutionary transitions from deep to shallow waters.\n9.1\tINTRODUCTION\nThe Hydrozoa live in a wide range of aquatic systems (mainly marine) and are the most diverse medusozoan Class with around 3700 described species (Bouillon et al. 2006). They have a great variety of forms, provide substratum for the settlement of other taxa and are planktonic and benthic predators that play an important role in food webs (Bouillon et al. 2006). Given both the ecological significance and taxonomic difficulties of the hydrozoan group, the clarification of their true diversity and a better understanding of their evolution are important. An incorrect discrimination of taxa may negatively influence ecological, biogeographic, evolutionary and applied biotechnological studies, as well as management and conservation planning (e.g. Knowlton 2000; Bickford et al. 2007). However, like in many marine invertebrate groups, the taxonomy of hydroids is poorly resolved and taxonomic expertise is diminishing. A paucity of diagnostic morphological characters is often found to categorise taxa, a consequence of their structural simplicity. Furthermore the high levels of morphological plasticity that hydrozoans display often make it difficult to differentiate intraspecific from interspecific variation.\nThe advent of molecular techniques has made available additional characters for objective discrimination of taxa. As a result, cryptic or pseudocryptic species have been discovered across nearly all metazoan phyla (e.g. reviews of Knowlton 2000; Bickford et al. 2007; Trontelj &amp; Fiser 2009). In the Cnidaria, reported cases of cryptic diversity are comparatively low compared with other major metazoan clades, such as the Porifera (Trontelj &amp; Fiser 2009). The limited discovery of cryptic species in cnidarians may result from a slow rate of genetic evolution, and/or it may be a consequence of regular hybridisation (reviewed by Knowlton 2000). However, past studies have primarily focused on Anthozoa but the Hydrozoa have attracted relatively little attention. Recent studies have revealed cryptic or pseudocryptic species within the Hydrozoa (Govindarajan et al. 2005; Schuchert 2005; Miglietta et al. 2007, 2009; Moura et al. 2008; Folino-Rorem et al. 2009), suggesting that hydrozoan diversity might be significantly underestimated. Furthermore, vast geographic areas remain unexplored and poorly sampled for Hydrozoa, including most of the deep sea. Despite a long history of research on hydrozoan systematics, dating back to the pre-Linnaean times, new taxa, even at the level of families are still being discovered (e.g. Moura et al. 2007).\nMoura et al. (2008) revealed the potential of the mitochondrial 16S mRNA gene to distinguish hydrozoan species and reported cryptic diversity within the genus Nemertesia Lamouroux, 1812. Species of Nemertesia usually develop prominent, complex, arborescent sessile colonies and are frequently present, sometimes with high abundance, in oceans globally, from abyssal depths to shallow coastal waters. Nemertesia species are mainly found on soft bottoms, but can also overgrow hard substrata including rocks, shells or coral debris. An individual colony of Nemertesia usually consists of a basal network of reticulate tubules (hydrorhiza) that serve as holdfast of a hydrocaulus (stem) with hydrocladia (lateral branches) carrying polyps for feeding (hydrothecae) and defensive and predatory functions (nematothecae) (see Fig. 9.1). The hydrocauli, generally also covered with nematothecae, are divided into internodes that usually bear apophyses that support the hydrocladia arranged alternately or typically on whorls (see Fig. 9.1A,B, or check glossary of morphological features in Bouillon et al. 2006). The hydrocladia are also subdivided into internodes: thecates with hydrothecae and nematothecae, and sometimes also athecates without hydrothecae but usually with nematothecae (see Fig. 9.1B,C). Gonothecae (the\nreproductive structures) are sessile, usually elongated and ovoid, and borne singly or in pairs in apophyses (see Fig. 9.1B). Some Nemertesia species may display sexual dimorphism, revealed by the contours of gonothecae (e.g. Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001; Ramil &amp; Vervoort 2006). The morphological characterisation of Nemertesia species includes the presence or absence of stem branching, the segmentation mode of hydrocladia, the number and arrangement of nematothecae on hydrocladial internodes, the form of gonothecae and hydrothecae, and the dimensions of structures such as the hydrothecae (Ramil &amp; Vervoort 2006). The phenotypic plasticity of the diagnostic characters is high, and taxonomy within Nemertesia has been controversial for a long time. Presently, nearly sixty species of Nemertesia are accepted (Ramil &amp; Vervoort 2006), but consensus about the validity of many of these or other currently synonymised species is still far from being achieved (e.g. Bouillon et al. 2006 recognized only forty Nemertesia species). In this sense, the genus exemplifies many of the systematic problems associated with the Class as a whole.\nFig. 9.1. Characteristics of Nemertesia: (A) aggregation of conspecific colonies of N. antennina at Berlengas, 15-25 m; (B) Part of a fertile colony of N. \u2018sp2\u2019; (C) basal hydrocladium of a N. \u2018sp6\u2019 specimen. Credits: (A) C.J. Moura, (B, C) C.J. Moura and J. Oliveira.\nLittle is known about the life-histories of Nemertesia species, although some details of N. ramosa (Lamarck, 1816) and N. antennina (Linnaeus, 1758) are known (Hughes 1975, 1977; Williams 1976). Like most hydroids, Nemertesia species do not develop free-swimming medusae, instead colonies release planulae (e.g. Millard 1975; Williams 1976; Hughes 1977). The short-lived planula larvae are not active swimmers but represent the only mobile stage of these hydroids that are locally dispersed by currents (Hughes 1977). Close proximity is required to achieve routine cross-fertilisation, and once planulae are released, long-distance dispersal away from the natal conspecific colonies is therefore\nprobably highly limited. Such life-history traits suggest that dispersal in Nemertesia likely fits a stepping-stone model.\nIn contrast to many other hydroids, and except for N. antennina that has been recorded from both sides of the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Pacific and Indian oceans (see Ansin Agis et al. 2001), Nemertesia species typically do not show large distributional ranges (cf. Ramil &amp; Vervoort 2006). The NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean Nemertesia species are particularly abundant in cooler waters, at high latitudes and/or in deep waters, but can also be found, usually at lower abundances in shallow depths of temperate/subtropical waters (C.J. Moura, pers. observ.). Given such a widespread vertical and horizontal distribution, the genus Nemertesia may also be a good candidate to study the evolutionary relationships between shallow- and deep-water forms.\nAims\nThis study uses the mitochondrial 16S mRNA gene along with morphological data to investigate cryptic diversity in Nemertesia. The focus is on processes causing speciation, phylogeographic affinities and evolution of the genus Nemertesia in the Atlantic and Mediterranean with respect to past geological and environmental events and in the context of the global diversity of these hydroids.\n9.2\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCollection and identification of samples\nNemertesia colonies were collected from 60 sampling sites of the north-east Atlantic and west Mediterranean (Fig. 9.2, Table 9.1). Specimens were fixed and preserved mostly in 96% ethanol, although sometimes in 70% ethanol. The material collected in the Azores and Madeira included specimens obtained as part of a study on by-catch from deepsea fisheries and, in some cases, colonies were frozen prior to fixation in ethanol. Taxa were identified by C.J. Moura following Ramil &amp; Vervoort (1992, 2006) and Ansin Agis et al. (2001). Measurements and other observations of putative diagnostic characters were undertaken on representatives identified under the nominal species N. antennina (Tables 9.2, 9.3, 9.5; Fig. 9.5) and N. belini Bedot, 1916 (Tables 9.4, 9.5), using calipers and a\ngraticule on a compound stereo microscope. Morphological data were analysed by means of a Principal Component analyses (PCA) executed in R environment (version 2.8.1, The R\nFoundation for Statistical Computing; http://www.r-project.org).\n60\u00b0W\n\u2606\n\u2605\n50\u00b0W\n40\u00b0W\n30\u00b0W\n25\u00b0W\n10\u00b0W\n20\u00b0W\nLegend:\nShallow-watei station with Nemertesia\nDeep-water station with Nemertesia\nDepth\n(meters):\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nFig. 9.2. Map of the NE Atlantic and western Mediterranean with representation of the sites with Nemertesia haplotypes herein studied.\nPlumularia and Monotheca hydroid colonies, used for the molecular dating analyses, were collected from shallow waters of the Azores, Madeira, Gorringe Bank, and several localities of mainland Portugal, by scuba diving (see Table 9.1). Specimens were sampled, fixed in 96% ethanol and identified in the laboratory by C. J. Moura.\nDNA extraction, amplification and sequencing\nProtocols for DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (16S) rDNA gene followed the methodology described by Moura et al.

The skeletons of voucher specimens were mounted in permanent slides and temporarily deposited in the Biological Research Collection of the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro (DBUA), Portugal. The material from the Portuguese coast and Gulf of Cadiz is temporarily deposited in the DBUA, Portugal. Specimens from Madeira remained in the Municipal\nMuseum collection at the Marine Biology Station of Funchal, Portugal. Azorean specimens gathered by the Department of Oceanography and Fisheries (DOP), University of the Azores, Portugal, were returned to that institution. Sampling details, GenBank and Museum accession numbers are described in Table 9.1.\nPhylogenetic analyses\nThe final dataset comprised 63 sequences of Nemertesia along with two species of Plumularia as outgroup (see Table 9.1). Previous phylogenetic analysis had established the Plumularia as the sister taxon to Nemertesia (Moura et al. 2008; Leclere et al. 2009). Sequences were aligned in MEGA version 4 (Tamura et al. 2007) using CLUSTALW with the default alignment settings and trimmed to the shortest sequence. MrModeltest version\n2.3\t(Nylander 2004) was used to determine the optimal probabilistic model of sequence evolution. The general time reversible model (GTR+I+G) was the selected using the Akaike Information Criterion. \u2018Maximum-likelihood\u2019 phylogenetic analyses were performed through the PHYML website (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml) (Guindon &amp; Gascuel 2003) using the GTR+I+G model. Bayesian analyses were also performed with MrBayes v3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist 2001), again using the GTR+I+G model. The search was run for 107 generations, with trees sampled every 1000 generations (the first million generations were discarded as \u2018burnin\u2019). Clade stability was assessed using nonparametric bootstrapping of ML analyses (1000 replicates) and Bayesian posterior probability values. PAUP 4.1 (Swofford 1998) was used to determine pairwise uncorrected sequence differences (P distances) for simple comparisons of percentage sequence divergence between taxa. A test of the monophyly of N. antennina was conducted with an SH test (Shimodaira &amp; Hasegawa 1999) using PAUP* version 4.0b10 (Swofford 1998). The most likely tree from the unconstrained analysis was compared with the optimal ML tree resulting from a search with the monophyly of N. antennina constrained. Depth characters (i.e. shallow or deep water) were mapped onto the selected phylogeny of Figs\n9.3\tand 9.7, using the maximum parsimony character reconstruction optimisation in Mesquite v2.6 (Maddison &amp; Maddison 2008).\nA preliminary molecular dating analysis was performed with the analysed 63 Nemertesia sequences, in conjunction with 34 Plumularia sequences from diverse localities of the Atlantic and Pacific, 11 Atlantic Monotheca sequences, and two\nHalopteriidae sequences as outgroup. Because Plumularia and Monotheca species are preferentially found in shallow waters, we included in the analyses a considerable haplotype sampling for these taxa to search for a preferred 16S nucleotide substitution rate (or valid substitution rate ranges) for the Plumulariidae based on well-known geological events (rise of the isthmus of Panama, and of Azorean islands) and on the correspondent geographical location of taxa. Given that, we could set potential approximate age ranges for the nodes of the Nemertesia phylogeny of Fig. 9.3. Molecular clock analyses were performed using BEAST v 1.5.2 that conducts a Bayesian MCMC analysis with the option of incorporating a strict or relaxed molecular clock model (Drummond &amp; Rambaut 2007). A strict molecular clock model was enforced as the data could not reject the molecular clock (p=0.97) according to the likelihood ratio test (Felsenstein 1988). The analysis was run for 30 million replicates, sampling every thousandth record. The initial first million replicates were discarded as burnin. The output chronograms were rescaled to fit mean substitution rates observed for related taxa (Govindarajan et al. 2005; Lindner et al. 2008). As the basis for the choice of a preferred substitution rate, a prior age constraint of 3.5 million years ago (Ma) (e.g. Cronin &amp; Dowsett 1996; Collins et al. 1996; Wares &amp; Cunningham 2001) was used for the divergence between Pacific and Atlantic Plumularia setacea lineages. However, a potential source of error might be associated with this choice because the process of the closure of the Central American Isthmus started approximately 15 Ma and was not fully complete until about 2.8Ma (Lessios 2008). Therefore we have an additional constraint by including the apparently endemic Azorean P. setacea lineage from Flores which could only have diverged from sister populations after the rise of the first Azorean island ~8 Ma (e.g. Hughes &amp; Malmqvist 2005). (For further details of the presented molecular dating analyses see Appendix A).\n9.3\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n16S rDNA nucleotide sequence data were successfully obtained from 51 distinct Nemertesia colonies collected from various depths (between approx. 10 and 1400 m) in areas of the eastern Atlantic (Gulf of Cadiz, Azores, Madeira, United Kingdom, Spain and\nPortugal continental) and western Mediterranean (Alboran Sea). Most of the diverse habitats sampled in this study are still poorly known, e.g. deep-sea mud volcanoes, areas of carbonate chimneys and crusts, seamounts, cold-water coral bioherms, and even many shallow-water habitats of the Portuguese coast.\nThe sequence alignment analysed contained a total of 65 sequences of 565 basepairs length (nucleotide frequencies are A = 37.51%, T = 29.44%, C = 15.18%, and G = 17.88%; proportion of invariant sites = 0.25; gamma shape parameter = 0.1319). The monophyly of the genus Nemertesia was evident with strong bootstrap support (Figs 9.3 and 9.7), as in Lecl\u00e8re et al. (2007) and Moura et al. (2008). Within the Nemertesia clade, N. ventriculiformis (Marktanner-Turneretscher, 1890), N. ramosa, N. norvegica (G.O. Sars, 1874) and N. antennina (from shallow waters) are represented as well defined monophyletic species, with little intraspecific variation between haplotypes from relatively distant geographical areas. In contrast, the sequence variation is much higher in N. belini and especially within N. antennina sensu lato (s.l.) with the latter appearing to be polyphyletic and with sympatric specimens falling into separate clades (Fig. 9.3).\nN. ramosa appears as sister to a clade containing all the other Nemertesia species. Within the latter clade the phylogenetic relationships between the recognized genealogical species is not fully resolved. N. antennina from European coastal waters forms a sister clade to N. belini, which in turn are sister to a clade containing the several cryptic lineages of deep-sea \u2018N. antennina\". However, nodal support for this topology is low (bs=61%, pp=84%), and constrained analyses do not reject the monophyly of the nominal species N. antennina. The monophyly of N. antennina plus N. belini relative to N. ventriculiformis, N. norvegica and N. ramosa receives low support (bs=34%, pp=67%), but is consistent with morphological data. The latter three species typically display supracalycine nematothecae and usually do not contain athecate internodes, in contrast to the former species.\nNemertesia ramosa\nN. ramosa usually develops prominent branched colonies and has been observed frequently in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, from very shallow waters (3 m), where it can be abundant, to bathyal depths (1425 m). It has also been reported from the Indian Ocean, on the coasts of South Africa and Mozambique (see detailed distributional ranges in Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001). This species is represented by five haplotypes with high\nPi\t\u00cd ari \u00ed .5 tri c to carp a\n1\nMelilla Carbonae Mound, 245 m-Al boran Sea Mui hacen mud vol cano, 365 m - Al boran Sea\nViana Castelo,25-33 m - NW Portugal\nViana Castelo,23-33 m - NW Portugal\nCarbonate Province Un known, 473 m - Gulf of Cadi z Central Carb.

These low levels of intraspecific haplotypic diversity could be due to wide geographic connectivity of populations, recent bottleneck events, or poor resolution of the gene at the intraspecific level.\nNemertesia ramosa taxonomy\nThe low genetic distances among the represented N. ramosa haplotypes support the rejection of the variety Nemertesia ramosa var. plumularioides Billard (1906) (e.g. Ansin Ag\u00eds et al. 2001). This variety was identified from colonies sampled in the deep waters of the Gulf of Cadiz which presented hydrocladia alternating in one plane along the axis of the hydrocaulus, instead of arranged in typical decussate verticils. Hughes (1977) found such a deviant mode of colony development in N. antennina when cultivated in laboratory conditions (but not in the field). This abnormal growth mode was also observed but only distally to a point of regeneration of the hydrocaulus in a few N. antennina colonies from shallow Portuguese waters (C.J. Moura, pers. observ.). Many of the cryptic \u2018N. antennina\" colonies found on the bathyal depths of the Gulf of Cadiz, and N. ramosa from the same geographical area, also appear to reduce effort in the clonal propagation of colonies possibly as a result of poor food supply and/or unsuitable abiotic conditions in deep-sea environments. Such a mode of growth has sometimes been attributed to the juvenile lifestage of colonies (e.g. Bedot 1917; Millard 1975; Ansin Ag\u00eds et al. 2001), but the above-mentioned specimens were collected in different periods of the year from deep waters of the Gulf of Cadiz and were consistently delicate, predominantly with alternating hydrocladia in one plane, whilst the other Nemertesia colonies inspected from the Azores, Madeira and coastal European waters were, by the given order, much more robust with the apophyses distributed in verticils. As further discussed in the N. antennina sub-section \u2018morphology and speciation\u2019, these morphological adaptations may have influenced the evolution of Nemertesia species.\nOnshore to offshore evolutionary pattern\nA survey of the literature on N. ramosa (check list of synonymies by Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001) shows a much higher number of reports of this species in shallow rather than deep waters. While such reports could represent a sampling bias, they may also suggest that N. ramosa has shallow-water preference and perhaps origin, as proposed by our ancestral character state reconstruction analysis (not conclusive because of limited haplotype sampling). If this is the case, the occurrence of N. ramosa in deep waters of the Gulf of Cadiz may constitute evidence of a submergence of the species into the deep sea. Such an evolutionary pattern resembles that found for Oculina Lamarck, 1816 coral populations (Eytan et al. 2009), and it is in agreement with the general perception that deep-sea communities derived from shallow waters (Jablonski et al. 1983). It is also notable that the two deep-sea clades in the phylogeny are distinctly segregated in an otherwise unresolved N. ramosa clade (Fig. 9.3).\nNemertesia norvegica\nN. norvegica is a relatively poorly studied species known to occur in the NE Atlantic, from Norway to Senegal, at depths between 65 and 1250 m (Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001). Our analysis supports the monophyly of this species and shows little genetic differentiation between five colonies of this species collected from the Azores, at depths ranging from about 200 to 600 m. The haplotype of N. norvegica represented by a colony from the remote Atlantis Seamount (ca. 600 m) differs by only three base-pairs (0.5% P distance) from all the other colonies collected from shallower waters.\nNemertesia ventriculiformis\nN. ventriculiformis has been sporadically found in the eastern Atlantic, from France to the Cape Verde islands, and in the western Mediterranean (including the Adriatic), especially from deep waters (up to 900 m), but has also been recorded in coastal waters (below 10 m depth) (Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001; Vervoort 2006). The N. ventriculiformis clade, represented by nine colonies from the bathyal zone of the Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea (333-600 m), included only two haplotypes differing by a single nucleotide. It is worth noting that the same haplotype was observed between individuals from the bathyal environments of both the Alboran Sea and the Atlantic Moroccan margin.\nNemertesia belini\nN. belini is a quite uncommon species mainly found in deep waters (91-1229 m) from the Azores and Cape Verde islands (Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001). It shows such a high level of morphological variation that diagnostic characters have not been fixed for this species (Bedot 1916, 1921; Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001). Our sampling, from the the Azores, Madeira and Alboran Sea, spans a large part of the known distributional range of the species. Data indicate that N. belini is monophyletic with three considerably divergent lineages (in four specimens). A colony from the Azores is found genetically very close to another from Madeira (0.4% P distance). Another somewhat divergent lineage of N. belini is also found in the Azores (1.4% P distance between clades). The two lineages from the Azores are divergent from the other \u2018N. belini\u2019 colony from the Alboran Sea (4.5 - 4.8% P distance), suggesting that these two clades have been genetically isolated for a long time (likely since the Pliocene period - Fig. 9.7).\nNemertesia belini species-complex taxonomy\nThe syntype of this species was originally sampled from Pico (Azores) at a depth of 1160 m, and it is likely that any of the colonies sampled in the Azores may represent the same taxon. Our sample from S\u00e3o Jorge, Queimada, comes from a similar depth (10621100 m) and a locality nearby Pico, and along with the closely related sample from Madeira, it is the most morphologically similar to the type material (see Table 9.4). The sample from the Azores Bank differs from all the others by the frequent absence of athecate internodes (whenever present they are of small size), the occasional occurrence of two hydrothecae on thecate internodes, and the comparatively smaller hydrothecae. Median nematothecae of this sample and the one from the Alboran Sea were found to be smaller than the others. The representative of the Alboran Sea lineage differs from all the other material identified as N. belini by the strict absence of supracalycine nematothecae and notably smaller size of gonothecae. This sample also has much smaller nematocysts of the largest type, compared with the specimens from S\u00e3o Jorge. The morphological and genetic data indicate that the samples from the Alboran Sea and the Azores Bank may correspond to two cryptic species but this requires study of further samples.\nNemertesia antennina\nNemertesia antennina was amongst the first hydroids ever described, and it is the type species of the genus. N. antennina or \u2018the sea beard' is one of the most abundant and well-recognized hydroids because of its extremely large colonies that can reach approximately 30 cm, its habit of growing in clumps (see Fig. 9.1A), and its wide distribution in various habitats. It can be extremely abundant in northern temperate waters of the Atlantic but is less common in warm temperate and Mediterranean waters (C.J. Moura, pers. observ.). Further sporadic observations have been reported from the eastern coast of South Africa, and the Pacific Ocean from Indochina and Japan (Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001). N. antennina can be found from shallow sublittoral (usually bellow 10 m; C.J. Moura, pers. observ.) to deeper offshore waters (2400 - 2450 m; Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001).\nAzores\nlorocco\nFrance\n\u25a1 N. sp4\n|~\u00e3~| /V. sp5\nSP7\n15\u00b0W\nDepth (meters): n0\nN. antennina\nk- lineage 3\n40\u00b0N^C N- SP3\nuL.

Geographical location of the lineages discovered within the Nemertesia antennina and N. belini species complexes.\nMolecular phylogenetic studies testing the relationships of the N. antennina complex were performed by Moura et al. (2008). The authors found two cryptic lineages from the bathyal environments of the Gulf of Cadiz and suggested that N. perrieri is synonymous to the typical N. antennina from European coastal waters. In the present study, a surprisingly large number of distinct evolutionary units have now been discovered by sampling mostly the eastern Atlantic deep waters in a relatively small part of the distributional range of \u2018N. antennina\". Two main clades are recovered for the paraphyletic \u2018N. antennina group': one from shallow coastal waters of Europe (ca. 10-62 m depth), and\nthe other representing deep-sea colonies from the Gulf of Cadiz, Alboran Sea, Bay of Biscay and Azores (ca. 70-1400 m depth). The clade containing typical N. antennina from shallow waters of Europe seems more closely related to N. belini than to the other \u2018N. antennina\". However, support for this relationship is poor and we cannot reject the monophyly of N. antennina s.l. (P = 0.244). If we assume support of this topology, it appears there has been a long divergence time between the two main clades of the nominal N. antennina, probably since the Late Miocene (see Fig. 9.7).\nTypical Nemertesia antennina clade\nA highly supported compact clade of N. antennina is represented by colonies from shallow European coastal waters. The type locality of N. antennina is in the UK, and therefore, this clade is inferred as representing the N. antennina described by Linnaeus. The position of the typical N. antennina clade nested amongst deep-sea clades suggests an evolutionary transition from deep to shallow waters, in accordance with the pattern found for stylasterid corals (Lindner et al. 2008) and to some extent also for scleractinian corals (Kitahara et al. 2010), although our study has a narrower taxonomic scope.\nDespite the limited haplotype sampling for this clade, our data suggest a segregation of populations between northern and southern European coastal waters (genetic distances between 0.5 and 1 %). The formation of these lineages is likely to have been associated with the glaciations of the early-mid Pleistocene which probably fragmented N. antennina into a number of refugial populations, including on the Atlantic coast of Europe and in the Mediterranean (see Fig. 9.7 and Table 9.6). These populations accumulated genetic differences in allopatry, and with ice-retreat and subsequent expansion of populations, they have come into secondary contact somewhere along the coast of northern Portugal or Spain. A similar pattern has been found amongst the populations of several marine species in European waters and points to a shared history of the impacts of past glacial cycles on the European marine fauna (e.g. Roman &amp; Palumbi 2004; Schuchert 2005; Gomez et al. 2007; Hoarau et al. 2007; Campo et al. 2010).\nCryptic Nemertesia \u2018antennina \u2019 clade\nThis clade is represented by samples from the Gulf of Cadiz, Azores, Bay of Biscay and Alboran Sea, at depths between 51-100 m and 1418 m. It comprises a highly supported\ngroup, structured into numerous divergent cryptic lineages (Figs 9.3 and 9.4), most of which receive high nodal support. Many of these lineages are from deep waters although there is no clear pattern in bathymetric distribution and separation of putative taxa. Apart from the Azorean haplotypes that cluster separately, all the other divergent cryptic evolutionary units encountered (four well defined genealogical species) occur in very close spatial proximity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Nemertesia sp1 is the only species we identified as present in the Mediterranean and on a single mud volcano (Mercator) of the Gulf of Cadiz. In contrast, the closely related N. sp2 is unknown in the Mediterranean or at the Mercator mud volcano but occurs in many other localities along the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz. Our preliminary molecular dating analyses (see Fig. 9.7 and Table 9.6) suggest that we cannot exclude the hypothesis that the common ancestors of N. sp1 and N. sp2 might have diverged as a result of one or more glaciation events that retained the ancestral N. sp1 in the Mediterranean basin, isolated from its Atlantic sister taxon because of regression(s) in sea level that prevented gene flow through deep waters of the Strait of Gibraltar (similar to Patarnello et al. 2007). The presence of a haplotype of N. sp1 in the deep waters of the western Mediterranean, Gulf of Cadiz and relatively shallow waters at Bay of Biscay (119 m) could be explained by the influence of Mediterranean outflow waters (e.g. see current regimes given by Iorga &amp; Lozier 1999). Furthermore, the Spanish specimen probably represents a recent emergence of N. sp1 from deep to shallow waters. Nemertesia sp1 is the only species of this clade detected living on active cold seep habitats, revealing its adaptation to or tolerance of these environments. Nemertesia sp4 and the clade of Azorean colonies (composed of N. sp5, N. sp6 and N. sp7) group with the clade containing N. sp1 and N. sp2, but the phylogenetic relations between these three evolutionary branches are not clear.\nThe three haplotypes of colonies from the Azores cluster with high bootstrap support. However, both morphological and nucleotide differences suggest that they might be considered distinct but related species. The haplotype of N. sp5 from Terceira, Azores, sampled from a relatively shallow depth (between 51 and 100 m) clusters amongst lineages represented by colonies of bathyal origin, again representing another evolutionary shift from deep to shallow waters. The divergence between N. sp5 and N. sp7 likely occurred in the Pleistocene during the 100 KY orbitally forced glaciations (e.g. see Shackleton &amp; Hall 1984; Raymo et al. 1989; Cronin &amp; Raymo 1997; Raymo et al. 1998; Mc Intyre et al.\n2001) (Fig. 9.7). Environmental changes during these cycles, along with changes in sea level, may have driven coastal faunal extinctions opening the way for recolonization of shallow waters from the deep sea. These results provide further evidence that the \u2018sea beard' reported for the Azorean archipelago arrived there via deep waters and that the shallow-water fauna of ocean archipelagos may derive not just through larval or adult dispersal of shallow-water species (similar to the findings of Lindner et al. 2008 for Distichopora robusta Lindner, Cairns and Guzman, 2004). This is different from a classic \u2018island' view of population isolation by distance and allopatric or peripatric speciation and suggests that oceanic islands and shallow seamounts may have played a role in speciation of hydroids in this region. Such divergence, occurring in a continuously distributed species along a strong environmental gradient associated with depth, is compatible with a parapatric model of speciation.\nNemertesia sp4 is poorly represented in the analyses but corresponds to a distinct cryptic species of the N. antennina complex found at both the Moroccan and Iberian margins of the Gulf of Cadiz, at a wide depth range (376 and 1418 m, respectively). Morphologically, it resembles N.sp3 and although they may occur very close geographically, the genetic distance is almost 5%. Nemertesia sp3 is represented by a highly divergent haplotype sister to a clade containing all other represented species of cryptic \u2018N. antennina'. So far, N. sp3 has only been detected in two proximate localities of the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz (next to Mercator mud volcano) at about 400 m depth.\nN. antennina species-complex taxonomy\nThe nominal species N. antennina is morphologically variable, including in some of its diagnostic characters: unbranched hydrocaulus with hydrocladia comprising a basal ahydrothecate internode followed by thecate internodes with three nematothecae, alternated with ahydrothecate internodes with one or two nematothecae (e.g. Billard 1906; Ansin Agis et al. 2001). These features separate it from other Nemertesia species including the morphologically similar Nemertesia perrieri (Billard, 1901), which differs by having ahydrothecate internodes regularly with two nematothecae, or occasionally two successive ahydrothecate internodes with one nematotheca each between thecate internodes (Ansin Agis et al. 2001). Ansin Agis et al. (2001) compared the holotypes of both species and\nadded differences such as the morphology of the hydrotheca and the presence/absence of nematothecae on the hydrocaulus (the latter difference erroneously assigned - C.J. Moura, pers. observ.). However, it is difficult to reconcile the use of such variable characters as diagnostic for N. antennina (e.g. Billard 1906). Many species and varieties have been described as separate from the \u2018N. antennina group' (complete synonymies given by Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001). Some of these taxa were inadequately described and their status is controversial. Recently (e.g. Ramil &amp; Vervoort 1992; Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001; Bouillon et al. 2006), the only species recognised as separate from N. antennina have been, without general consensus: N. fraseri, N. pinnata, N. perrieri and N. irregularis, originally described from the northern Pacific coast (18-37 m), Atlantic American coast (106-682 m), Canaries (100 m) and Cape Verde Islands (800 m), respectively. All other species or varieties proposed were regarded as synonymous to N. antennina or to N. perrieri. Nemertesia irregularis, a species similar to N. perrieri, but differing from the latter by having athecate internodes sporadically with only one nemathotheca, was recently reincluded in the synonymy of N. antennina by Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. (2001).\nMorphological differences between shallow- and deep-water lineages\nMorphologically, the main difference detected between the two major clades of the \u2018N. antennina\" complex (shallow- vs. deep-water clades) relates to the dimensions of gonothecae. These reproductive structures are larger in specimens from coastal European waters with a greater maximum length and diameter (see Fig. 9.5A, B and Table 9.2). However, gonothecae were not found in some of the resolved cryptic lineages, and their dimensions can vary intraspecifically by location as reported for N. sp1 (see Table 9.3). The length of both thecate and athecate internodes were found to be lower in the clade of typical N. antennina, though sometimes these ranges overlap those for some cryptic lineages (see Fig. 9.5C,D and Table 9.2). The clade containing typical N. antennina has a relatively larger diameter of the rim of hydrothecae than the other cryptic lineages, excluding N. sp5 and N. sp7 (Fig. 9.5E and Table 9.2). While further haplotype sampling is needed to test whether these morphological differences vary intraspecifically with depth or habitat, our data suggests that the hydroid species from coastal waters generally have more robust colonies, wider hydrothecae (that sustain the feeding polyps), larger gonothecae (reproductive structures) and smaller internodes, than in deep waters. This is consistent\nwith the evidence that in coastal waters nutrient availability and competition for space are\nhigher.\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n\t\tB\n\t\t\n\t\tL\n\t. 1\t\n1\t\t\n\t\t\nFig. 9.5.

However, by combining the observed and measured morphological characters, phenotypic differences can be sufficiently obvious and consistent (see Fig. 9.6) to clearly identify them without the usage of molecular markers.\nThe results of a principal component analysis (Fig. 9.6) show that typical N. antennina can be differentiated from all other lineages by the size of hydrothecae and hydrocladial internodes. N. sp7 specimens demarcates from the others mainly by the great length of nematocysts, in comparison with the other putative species of the complex.\nFig. 9.6. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) of morphologic measurements of specimens of the Nemertesia antennina species complex.\nAbbreviations: BIH = Basal internode of hydrocladium length, HI = Hydrothecate internode length, AI = Ahydrothecate internode length , HLAbW = Hydrotheca length of abcauline wall:, HLAdW = Hydrothecae length of adcauline wall:, HDR = Hydrothecae diameter at rim:, NL = Nematocysts length, ND = Nematocysts diameter.\nThe other two putative species herein reported for the Azores (N. sp5 and N. sp6), despite represented uniquely by one specimen each, are well differentiated by our PCA analyses (Fig. 9.6). Nemertesia sp2 specimens stand out grouped, but morphologically close to one specimen of N. sp4 (Fig. 9.6). These two putative species can be in fact easily confounded, but N. sp4 tends to have smaller ahydrothecate internodes (Table 9.5). This PCA analyses (Fig. 9.6) do not distinguish morphologically the putative species N. sp3, N. sp1 and N. sp4, which are curiously relatively well divergent by 16S haplotype data (Fig. 9.3).\nA direct reading of the present diagnostic characters of N. antennina suggests that N. sp1 is the more morphologically similar to the typical N. antennina from shallow waters\nof the European coasts, having usually one nematotheca per ahydrothecate internode. All the other cryptic lineages are represented mainly by colonies with two nematothecae on the ahydrothecate internodes (exception for N. sp7 that has 1-2 nematothecae). Additionally N. sp2 is easily differentiated across all lineages by the significantly longer ahydrothecate internodes (Fig. 9.6, Table 9.5). Nemertesia sp3 and N. sp4 are morphologically extremely similar species found in close spatial proximity but they differ by the size of the hydrothecate internodes that tend to be smaller in N. sp4. Nemertesia sp6 is genetically and morphologically the most divergent from the other cryptic Azorean taxa (Fig. 9.6). It differs by the longer thecate internodes, smaller hydrothecae and nematocysts and usually two nematothecae on the basal internodes of hydrocladia. Sequence divergence (0.9 % P distance) is relatively slight between N. sp5 and N. sp7, but they differ by the size of athecate internodes and of the adcauline wall of hydrothecae, which are usually higher for the latter species. Nemertesia sp7 also have nematocysts with larger size than other Azorean lineages. Nemertesia sp5 has similar characteristics to the type material of N. perrieri, original from Canary Islands (ca. 100 m), and may prove to be conspecific with that species. Despite genetic and morphological differences that induce the separation of the detected Azorean lineages as different species, we still do not have enough samples to show reciprocally monophyletic clades for these putative cryptic taxa, and therefore, the taxonomic status of N. sp5, N. sp6 and N. sp7 is not yet certain.\nThe major phenotypic differences detected between the cryptic evolutionary units of the N. antennina group relate to the size of gonothecae, hydrocladial internodes, hydrothecae and nematocysts. However, these characteristics can be variable, homoplastic and somewhat intergraded between sympatric species (Figs 9.5 and 9.6). It is understandable that many species and varieties were previously distinguished from N. antennina as a result of extensive differences between morphotypes, but these were later synonymised during taxonomic revisions (e.g. Bedot 1917; Ramil &amp; Vervoort 1992; Ans\u00edn Ag\u00eds et al. 2001). Even with the given phylogenetic analyses, the taxonomic status of these previously described species (apart from the typical N. antennina) and varieties remains doubtful as their specified diagnostic characters are insufficient or even incorrect, taxonomic descriptions are inadequate and many have insufficient sampling information or representation. Furthermore, the revision of old type material is highly constrained by its deterioration or loss and the infeasibility of extraction of pure DNA. Ultimately, several of\nthe taxa detected in the present analysis may remain truly cryptic species if they cannot be reliably identified on the basis of morphological features comparable to previously described species and/or varieties.\nDespite demonstrating a demarcation of the established putative species with 16S sequence information integrated with morphologic characters, we suggest that further geographical representation of the haplotypes and phylogenetic information with other molecular markers (e.g. nuclear) are needed to ascertain the real number of biological species within the N. antennina complex. Regardless of the number of cryptic species proposed in this study, it was evidently demonstrated that the \u2018N. antennina' reported both both in the Azores and in the continental margins of Europe and Africa, does not in fact correspond to the true species N. antennina that is found in European coasts.\nMorphology and speciation\nPhylogenetic reconstruction suggests that the ancestor of the cryptic clade of \u2018N. antennina' would have a deep-sea origin. Consequently, the great majority of lineages of that cryptic clade correspond to specimens with two or three nematothecae per ahydrothecate internode. Such a morphological condition is consistent with a hypothetical adaptation to food-limited habitats in the deep sea, where the production of more nematothecae by colonies would be advantageous for the efficient capture of prey at low densities. The phylogenetic position of N. sp1 and N. sp7 demonstrates that the reduction from several nemathotecae per ahydrothecate internodes to one evolved multiple times. However, the phylogenetic information provided by this morphological condition should be interpreted with caution given the conspecificity between shallow-water \u2018 N. perrieri' from the Mediterranean, consistently with two nematothecae per ahydrothecate internode, and the characteristic N. antennina from southern Portugal. The number of nematothecae per athecate internode seems most likely to be driven environmentally. Perhaps more important in explaining the observed speciation patterns are the morphological adaptations of colonies to the heterogeneity of deep-sea habitats (e.g. active and inactive mudvolcanoes, carbonate mounds, seamounts and coralline and/or poriferan bioherms) such as the maximum height of colonies and the number of apophyses per internodes of hydrocaulus. For example, the colonies of N. sp1 collected from the Alboran Sea were much taller and consequently with more apophyses per internode, more feeding polyps and\nwith higher production of gonothecae, than colonies of the same species (or of other species of the \u2018cryptic \u2018N. antennina\" clade') that were found on the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz. The maximum size of colonies registered from the sample containing N. sp5 collected at shallow waters of the Azores was about four times greater than the size of N. sp6 and N. sp7 colonies collected from deeper waters of the same archipelago (Table 9.2). As previously reported for N. ramosa, the cryptic Nemertesia found at bathyal depths in the Gulf of Cadiz also develop smaller delicate colonies with hydrocladia mainly arranged alternately along the hydrocaulus. Again, this may be an adaptation to low food availability and/or unfavourable environmental conditions where intensive clonal propagation of colonies would not be advantageous for the survival of individuals. Such adaptation has the cost of developing less apophyses and gonothecae per colony, and therefore, the process of sexual reproduction - the only known mode of spatial dispersal in Nemertesia - is constrained by a more reduced chance of fertilisation and release of fewer planulae per colony. Furthermore, if gonothecae in shallow waters are in fact commonly larger (see Fig. 9.5, Tables 9.2, 9.3), less gametes may be produced per gonotheca in the deep sea, also limiting reproductive output per individual offshore. These factors result in the production of less reproductive units per population and should limit dispersal at large spatial scales. Such impediments for dispersal might be further enhanced by habitat availability. For example, all the represented cryptic Nemertesia colonies found in the Gulf of Cadiz, with exception of N. sp1, were associated with areas of carbonate crusts or chimney build-ups, usually within scattered patches of (fossil) scleractinian frameworks and rubble. These seafloor features provide suitable substrata for settlement of planulae and enhance local productivity and/or biodiversity by harbouring other taxa usually rare in the surrounding deep sea.\nEvolution over geological ages\nOur molecular dating analyses (Fig. 9.7) reveal the existence of a small number of Plumulariidae clades that have persisted since the middle Miocene - an epoch of global (oceanic) warm temperatures (e.g. Raymo 1994; Zachos et al. 2001; Retallack 2002) and extinctions (e.g. Sepkoski 1992). In contrast, high levels of cladogenesis are seen in the late Miocene, including the evolutionary transition from shallow to deep waters of the ancestor of all Nemertesia species represented, excluding N. ramosa (Fig. 9.7).

Note that some terminal branches of the Nemertesia clade end in triangles that represent well-established lineages.\nphenomena can be associated with a period of global cooling (e.g. Shackleton &amp; Kennett 1975; Ciesielski et al. 1982) interspersed by warmer and arid episodes (e.g. Van Dam &amp; Weltje 1999) and intensification of the thermohaline circulation with the formation of the North Atlantic Deep Water (e.g. Wright et al. 1991; Billups 2002) in the late Miocene. The early-mid-Pliocene was an epoch of climatic warmth (e.g. Cronin 1991; Lawrence et al. 2009) that included the Mediterranean salinity crisis (e.g. Shackleton &amp; Kennett 1975; McKenzie &amp; Oberhaensli 1985; Hodell et al. 1986, 2001) and coincides with a period of cladogenesis of some of the deep-sea clades of Nemertesia. Interestingly, all lineages represented from the Mediterranean seem to have been generated after the Messinian salinity crisis, which likely eradicated all \u2018plumulariids\u2019 that were established in the basin. Finally, several glacial episodes that occurred through the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene (e.g. Shackleton &amp; Hall 1984; Raymo et al. 1989; Cronin &amp; Raymo 1997; Raymo et al. 1998; McIntyre et al. 2001) may explain: (1) the differentiation of N. sp1 as a species distinct to N. sp2 (possibly because of the isolation of the ancestral of N. sp1 in the Mediterranean, as previously referred in section \u2018Cryptic \u2018Nemertesia antennina' clade\u2019); (2) the split of N. cf. perrieri / sp5 from N. sp7 and the evolutionary transition of the former lineage to shallow waters (see section \u2018Cryptic Nemertesia \u2018antennina' clade\u2019); (3) the genesis of genetically distinct populations of N. antennina (see section \u2018Typical Nemertesia antennina clade\u2019) and Plumularia and Monotheca species (Fig. 9.7).\n9.4\tCONCLUSIONS\nThe phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial 16S mRNA haplotype data of Nemertesia species collected from shallow and deep waters of the eastern Atlantic and western Mediterranean proved extremely useful in delineating species and clarifying some of their intra- and inter-specific phylogenetic associations. Haplotype data for Nemertesia species revealed genetic similarities between intraspecific populations in the deep waters of the western Mediterranean and the Gulf of Cadiz (for N. sp1 and N. ventriculiformis), deep waters of Madeira and Azores (for N. belini and N. ramosa), shallow waters of central Portugal and UK (for N. ramosa), shallow waters of central and southern Portugal and the Mediterranean (for N. antennina) and between the shallow waters of North Portugal, UK\nand NW France (for N. antennina). The zero genetic distance encountered between samples of N. sp1 from deep waters of the western Mediterranean, Gulf of Cadiz and relatively shallow waters of southern Bay of Biscay potentially represents a recent emergence to shallow waters from the deep sea and may implicate a role of Mediterranean outflow waters in dispersal and population connectivity. Indeed, several recent shifts to and from the eastern Atlantic to the Mediterranean were proved to have occurred since the last enclosure of the Strait of Gibraltar during the Messinian salinity crisis (see Fig. 9.7, Table 9.6). Nemertesia ramosa is widely dispersed in the eastern Atlantic and western Mediterranean and revealed practically no sequence divergence between haplotypes from Madeira, Azores, Gulf of Cadiz and UK, from deep and shallow waters.\nIn contrast, surprisingly high cryptic diversity was revealed within the nominal species N. belini and N. antennina. For the deep-sea species N. belini, a monophyletic group was found comprising a highly divergent lineage from the western Mediterranean and a clade with two fairly distinct haplotypes both occurring in the Azores. Nemertesia antennina is possibly polyphyletic with two very divergent main clades with unsolved phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nemertesia. One clade from coastal waters of Europe, probably originated in the deep sea, likely represents the type species described by Linnaeus (1758). The other, essentially present in deep waters (51-100 m and 1418 m) of the eastern Atlantic and western Mediterranean, is represented by several new taxa. Within this deep-sea clade, seven putative cryptic species were discovered: three from the Azores and two geographically proximate seamounts clustered in a distinct lineage, and the remaining four found close to each other in the Gulf of Cadiz.\nAn ancient founder event from the continental margins of the eastern Atlantic could explain the divergence of the lineage represented by the Azorean cryptic \u2018N. antennina\u2019 colonies. However, the existence of different taxa on nearby seamounts raises the possibility that dispersal is restricted between seamounts and the islands in this region, and speciation or incipient speciation has occurred as a result. This would be contrary to recent evidence of gene flow between seamount populations (e.g. O'Hara 2007; McClain et al. 2009; Thoma et al. 2009), but would fit with some observations of genetic differentiation between seamounts for populations of species with limited dispersal (Samadi et al. 2006; Castelin et al. 2010, Clark et al. 2010). It suggests that geographic dispersal distance in Nemertesia may be limited. Therefore, dependence on the intensity and characteristics of\nwater currents for dispersal and speciation of these animals seems highly probable. The consequence of different morphological adaptations to the food-limited but heterogeneous deep-sea habitats may also have contributed to speciation in this genus. Additionally, the effects of past glacial cycles seem to have promoted population divergences (and ultimately speciation) and favoured evolutionary shifts from deep to shallow waters. Lindner et al. (2008) similarly found that stylasterid corals originated and diversified in the deep sea and invaded temperate and tropical shallow waters multiple times. In the present paper, we also demonstrate that the genus Nemertesia has diversified more extensively in deep waters and emerged to shallow waters more than once, but in a setting of temperate and subtropical latitudes of the NE Atlantic. In contrast, N. ramosa may present a recent case of submergence into deep waters, in agreement with the general notion that deep-sea forms derived from shallow waters (Jablonski et al. 1983; Eytan et al. 2009).\nMorphological and molecular dating analyses further supported the considerable long divergence times between the recognized distinct cryptic (or pseudo-cryptic) species within the N. antennina and N. belini complexes. The events that triggered diversification in the deep sea still remain difficult to identify. Nevertheless, the importance of deep-sea habitats as a source of phylogenetic diversity is evident from this and other studies (e.g. Lindner et al. 2008). Further hydrozoan studies will continue to bring important insights into the possible mechanisms of speciation and anatomical evolution in sessile marine invertebrates in both shallow- and deep-sea environments.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the invitations for the participation of MRC and other CESAM members in the Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea cruises.

The genus Monotheca was recovered as monophyletic with two widely diverged main clades, which are sister to a branch containing Plumularia and Nemertesia species. The latter genus is found sister to a clade containing morphologically similar species: Plumularia lagenifera, Allman, 1885, Plumularia strictocarpa, Pictet, 1893 and Plumularia setacea (Linnaeus, 1758). P. setacea is regarded as a common widespread near-cosmopolitan species (apparently absent from the Antarctic), especially abundant in shallow waters but present at least down to 604 m (see distributional details and synonymy in Ansin Agis et al. 2001). This study includes coastal Plumularia setacea haplotypes from the Azores, Madeira, the Gorringe Bank, and mainland Portugal, along with conspecific sequences published in GenBank from Chile, New Zealand, western USA, and northern and southern France (see Table 9.1). These P. setacea sequences represent several distinct haplotypes clustered monophyletically. Pacific samples group together separate from the other Atlantic P. setacea samples. The marked\nPacific/Atlantic segregation would have been triggered by the rise of the Isthmus of Panama. However, it is likely that the split of the represented Atlantic and Pacific P. setacea lineages would have been prior to this event. P. setacea collected from one of the most pristine and remote islands of the Azores - Flores, were found genetically quite diverse and with (so far) exclusive haplotypes for that archipelago when compared with both Pacific and other Atlantic samples (Fig. 9.7, and P. Schuchert, pers. comm.). Other haplotypes representative of Azorean P. setacea, namely from S\u00e3o Miguel/Faial and S\u00e3o Miguel harbour, are shared with populations from Madeira and the Mediterranean, respectively (Schuchert, unpublished). Therefore, these shallow-water and apparently endemic Azorean lineages from Flores would have emerged after the rise of the first Azorean island (ca. 8 Ma). Plumularia setacea from cooler waters of northern Europe (namely from NW France, northern and central mainland Portugal) form distinct but closely related clades to conspecific specimens from central Portugal down to the Mediterranean, resembling the pattern seen for shallow-water N. antennina. However, intraspecific haplotype diversity for P. setacea seems higher, possibly as a result of rafting, larger populations sizes and more undifferentiated choice of substrata for settlement of planulae. It also likely represents the influence of past Pleistocene glaciations on the fragmentation of P. setacea populations along the European coastline, as with typical N. antennina. These data do not support a cosmopolitan distribution for P. setacea.\nThe above-mentioned geological events were, by the given order, used to choose a preferred substitution rate for the 16S gene for plumulariids (see Table 9.6). Additionally, we were expecting a relatively rapid substitution rate for this gene in the Plumulariidae family, as previously suggested by Lecl\u00e8re et al. (2007) and Moura et al. (2008). The preferred rate appearing to fit most consistently with the geological events was 9.69x10-09 substitutions per site per year, which allowed setting (provisional) mean ages for the tree nodes of the phylogeny of Fig. 9.3 (Fig. 9.7, Table 9.6). Nevertheless, rates between approximately 4.49x10-09 and 1.21x10-08 substitutions per site per year were considered also as possible (see Table 9.6). Additionally, the genetic data comfortably fit a molecular clock with a very high P value (P = 0.97), suggesting constrained rates within all taxa represented in the analyses.\nTable 9.1. 16S rRNA sequence data.

A large number of hydroid species were identified morphologically and genetically from these geographical regions, increasing dramatically the numbers of hydrozoan records, especially in Portugal where hydrozoan research has been dormant for over half-century. The integration of genetic and morphological data allowed accurate identifications and a more realistic insight of the biogeographic, phylogenetic and evolutionary relations of taxa.\nIn the course of this Ph.D. thesis, over 300 hydroid species were identified in Portuguese waters only, and about 600 sequences of the hydrozoan \u2018DNA barcode\u2019 16S mRNA gene were obtained. For phylogenetic, phylogeographic and evolutionary purposes, higher haplotype sampling was generated for the hydrozoan families: Sertulariidae, Plumulariidae, Aglaopheniidae, Lafoeidae, Hebeliidae, Campanulinidae, Halopterididae, Kirchenpaueriidae, Haleciidae, Tiarannidae and Eudendriidae. However, the latter six families were not studied in as great detail in this dissertation, as the others. The systematics of Hydrozoa were revealed to be complex and the time was limited to describe all the findings of this Ph.D.; therefore the unresolved morphologicas and phylogenetic analyses on the other hydrozoan families identified and 16S sequences determined, will be only released in future publications.\nAround 350 16S sequences (of the ten hydrozoan families mentioned on the last paragraph) determined specifically for this Ph.D. thesis are mentioned in this dissertation, and analysed phylogenetically with other 16S sequences of phylogenetically close taxa previously published on GenBank.\nThe molecular phylogenetic analyses (integrated with morphological data) enabled the correction of taxonomic identifications based on morphological characters only, but also provided important insights to the systematic positions of taxa, and on their evolution and phylogeographic affinities along the shallow and deep waters of the NE Atlantic and western Mediterranean. Whether some hydroids species have in fact wide (vertical and horizontal) geographical distributions, or if they are in fact complexes of cryptic or pseudo-cryptic taxa was investigated. Molecular data were also used to investigate the evolution of Hydrozoa morphotypes from deep to shallow waters (or the reverse), and whether or not this has occurred multiple times.\nThe value of mt 16S rDNA sequence data was tested and confirmed by the integration and comparison with morphological data of various phenotypes. The 16S mRNA gene was revealed to be useful and consistent as a \u2018barcode\u2019 for hydrozoans, providing sufficiently high resolution to discriminate hydrozoans at the species-level. The few cases when 16S sequences of different nominal species were identical indeed corresponded to very morphologically similar taxa that may be synonymous. The phylogenetic information provided by 16S data was also extremelly informative and the well-supported clusters of species or specimens were practically in complete agreement with morphological characters.\nGenetic data highlighted many polyphyletic groups of Hydrozoa, such as: (1) the genera Gymnangium and Aglaophenia (Aglaopheniidae); (2) the genera Sertularia, Dynamena and Sertularella (Sertulariidae); (3) the superfamily Lafoeiodea and its two \u2018families\u2019: Hebellidae and Lafoeidae; (4) the genera Filellum, Lafoea and Acryptolaria (Lafoeidae).\nThe potential cryptic diversity observed in some taxa by the abnormal phylogenetic position and high genetic divergence within some nominal species, was congruent with morphological divergence of specimens. High levels of cryptic biodiversity were revealed both in shallow and deep waters, within the nominal species: (1) Sertularella fusiformis, S. mediterranea, Sertularia distans, Dynamena disticha, Thuiaria articulata and Diphasia margareta (Sertulariidae); (2) Lafoea dumosa, Zygophylax levinseni and Cryptolaria pectinata (Lafoeidae); (3) Nemertesia antennina, N. belini, Plumularia setacea, Monotheca obliqua, M. margaretta (Plumulariidae). Two undescribed species were also\nrevealed within Aglaopheniidae: one in deep waters of the Azores and the other from coastal waters of Madeira.\nOn the other hand, cases of probable synonymies, indicated by identical 16S sequences and/or low genetic distances coupled with paraphyly, were revealed between: (1) Aglaophenia elongata and A. acacia; (2) Aglaophenia pluma, A. tubiformis and A. octodonta (Aglaopheniidae); (3) Amphisbetia operculata and A. minima (Sertulariidae), and d) Sertularia cupressina and S. argentea (Sertulariidae).\nThe phylogeographic patterns highlighted by genetic analyses were concordant with geographic and/or bathymetric distance between samples. Morphological differences or similarities between haplotypes were also supported by phylogeographic inferences. Many of the phylogeographic patterns observed were also extremely similar across the hydrozoan families herein studied in greater detail. Other hydrozoan researchers have also consistently highlighted phylogeographic structure of hydroids based on 16S haplotype data (e.g. Govindarajan et al. 2005a, b, Schuchert 2005, Miglietta et al. 2009, Miranda et al. 2010). The phylogeographic relations of hydroids had not been studied in detail in the north-east Atlantic and western Mediterranean; therefore the majority of the phylogeographic inferences of the shallow and deep-water hydroids within the geographical setting covered by this thesis, are new to science.\nIdentical intraspecific partial 16S sequences, possibly revealing ongoing or recent genetic migration, were detected between: (1) shallow waters of Azorean islands (for Salacia desmoides, Amphisbetia operculata, Dynamena disticha, Sertularella cf. fusiformis and Aglaophenia picardi); (2) shallow waters of western Portugal and the Mediterranean (for Salacia desmoides, Sertularella mediterranea, Aglaophenia parvula, N. antennina); (3) shallow waters of western Portugal and the United Kingdom (for Diphasia rosacea, Gymnangium montagui, Aglaophenia kirchenpaueri, Aglaophenia tubulifera, Nemertesia ramosa and N. antennina); (4) deep waters of Madeira and Azores (for Nemertesia belini and N. ramosa); (5) deep waters of the Alboran Sea and Gulf of Cadiz (for Streptocaulus dollfusi, Aglaophenia lophocarpa, Campanulina panicula, Nemertesia sp1 and N. ventriculiformis); (6) contrasting bathyal depths of the Gulf of Cadiz (for Acryptolaria cf. conferta &amp; Nemertesia sp4); (7) deep waters of the Gulf of Cadiz and: Madeira (for Z. biarmata) and Norway (for Campanulina panicula); (8) deep-water localities of the Azores, Madeira, Gulf of Cadiz and coastal waters of western Portugal (for Sertularella\ngayi). The existence of the same 16S haplotype of Macrorhynchia philippina in shallow waters of Brazil and Madeira, was also associated to an unintentional human-introduction of that species in Madeira by boat(s). The presence of Coryne eximia in the Gorringe Bank was also likely to a human-induced introduction.\nLow levels of sequence divergence, possibly revealing relatively recent gene flow, was further detected between samples of: (1) shallow waters of western Portugal and Azores (for Amphisbetia operculata; Aglaophenia pluma and Sertularella mediterranea); (2) shallow waters of western Portugal and Madeira (for Sertularia distans and Aglaophenia pluma); (3) Azores and Madeira (for Dynamena disticha and Sertularia marginata in shallow waters, and for Nemertesia belini and N. ramosa by deep waters); (4) shallow waters of western Portugal and the Mediterranean (for Dynamena disticha and S. mediterranean; (5) between distant localities and contrasting bathyal depths of the Gulf of Cadiz (for Zygophylax biarmata and Acryptolaria cf. conferta); (6) deep waters of the Gulf of Cadiz and central-western Portugal (for Cryptolaria pectinata).\nThe considerable genetic diversity discovered in hydrozoan samples from relatively close deep-sea locations of the Azores (e.g. for Aglaophenia tubulifera, Acryptolaria spl, A. cf. craussicaulis , Cryptolaria pectinata, Nemertesia belini, Nemertesia \u2018antennina\u2019'), likely reveal the impact of water-currents generated by seamounts in the segregation of populations with reduced dispersive potential.\nThe high genetic diversity found in the bathyal environments of the Gulf of Cadiz (e.g. for Aglaophenia lophocarpa and Nemertesia \u2018antennina\u2019} may be a consequence of the great heterogeneity of habitats and diversity of water masses that converge in the depths of the Gulf of Cadiz.\nThe high haplotypic variability and/or geographical segregation found in European coastal waters (e.g. for Aglaophenia pluma, Lafoea dumosa, Plumularia setacea, Nemertesia antennina) may be explained by the effects on the isolation of populations during the last glaciations in the northern hemisphere. The effects of past glacial episodes probably promoted not only the divergence of populations, but also speciation (e.g. between Nemertesia sp.l and N. sp2) and favoured evolutionary shifts from deep to shallow waters. On the other hand, warmer geological periods may have caused extinctions of marine (hydroid) species.\nThe high phylogenetic resolution obtained for the Plumulariidae, raised further suspicion that the Messinian salinity crises eradicated hydroids from the Mediterranean basin, but after that event several episodes of gene flow may have occurred between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, in both directions in shallow and deep waters.\nThis study showed that, in the NE Atlantic, coastal marine environments sustain higher hydrozoan diversity and abundance, but the importance of deep sea habitats as a source of phylogenetic diversity (both in shallow and deep waters) was also evident. The present account revealed that hydrozoan diversity has been substantially underestimated at various taxonomic levels; it further provided evidence that many sessile marine invertebrates previously recorded with wide geographic distributions probably comprise complexes of morphologically similar but distinct species. It was also demonstrated that some nominal species of hydroids (e.g. Sertularella gayi and Aglaophenia tubulifera) are actually present in both shallow and deep waters, whilst other hydroid species with supposedly wide vertical distributions (e.g. Nemertesia antennina and Lafoea dumosa) represent in fact complexes of cryptic taxa.\nThe main explanatory causes proposed for speciation and population divergence of benthic hydroids were: species population size, dispersal mechanisms and ecological plasticity to inhabit different abiotic conditions, but also the influence of oceanic currents (and its properties), habitat heterogeneity, climate change and continental drift.\nFinnally this Ph.D. project should contribute to a better perception of the biodiversity and speciation mechanisms of sessile animals in the marine realm. In particular, this Ph.D. thesis will contribute to a new, more comprehensive insight of hydrozoan diversity in the NE Atlantic and western Mediterranean. The taxa more intensively studied during this Ph.D., have profound ineherent taxonomic problems, but are important and frequent components of coastal and deep-sea habitats. The knowledge of their true diversity is important for more accurate studies of ecology, biogeography, evolution and applied-biotechnology, as well as management and conservation planning (e.g. Knowlton). The comprehension of processes underlying speciation throughout past geological ages is particularly relevant, especially in the current context of a fast-changing\nworld threatened by large-scale losses of biodiversity (much of these remaining undescribed). The understanding of phenomena implicated in past and present speciation events will be important to predict extinctions and genesis of species.\nREFERENCES\nGovindarajan, A. F., Halanych, K.
