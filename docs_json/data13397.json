Sugar cane straw\n\nresidues were added on the surface of a Typic Harplortox in a polyvinyl chlorid (PVC) column at rates of 0, 20, 40, and 76 g kg-1, the\nsoil was incubated to field capacity with distilled water and incubated for 0, 7, 14, 45, and 90 days. Soil samples were taken at 0-5,\n5-10, 10-15, 15-20, and 20-25 cm depth. With the increase of sugar cane straw rates one verified the increase of soil pH\n\nCaCl2\n, and\n\ndecrease of KCl exchangeable Al in the top 15cm soil layer. The contribution of organic compounds to Al detoxification incresead with\nincreasing sugar cane straw rates. Wheat root elongation used as acid indicator plant increased with  increasing sugar cane straw rates.\nMaximum root growth  was about 15cm long in the soil after eight days for the highest sugar cane straw rate.\n\nIndex terms: Saccarum sp., plant residue, aluminun.\n\nRESUMO\nConduziram-se dois experimentos em laborat\u00f3rio avaliar o efeito da palha da cana- de-a\u00e7\u00facar na acidez do solo.

However, a new brazilian\nlegislation has been introduced to reduce burning sugar\ncane and improve mechanical harvesting. It is estimated\nthat sugar cane residues left after mechanical harvesting\nvaried from 13.8 Mg ha-1y-1 dray matter (OLIVEIRA et al.,\n1999) to 45 Mg ha-1y-1 fresh matter (ASGHAR &amp;\nKANEHIRO, 1976).\n\nAlthough there are many questions about the\nmangement of the sugar cane straw left after mechanical\nharvesting, the greatest impact compared with burning will\nbe on the soil organic matter content and its implication\nwith soil chemical, physical, and biological properties\n\n1Engenheiro Agr\u00f4nomo, Doutor \u2013 Centro de Ci\u00eancias Agr\u00e1rias/CCA, Departamento de Agronomia \u2013  Universidade Estadual de Londrina/UEL \u2013  Rod.\n Celso Garcia Cid \u2013 Cx.

It is well stablished that organic\nmatter has great effect on acid soil chemistry (ASGHAR &amp;\nKANEHIRO, 1980; HUE, 1992; MEDA et al., 2001;\nMIYAZAWA et al., 1993; POCKNEE &amp; SUMNER, 1997).\nMany mechanisms have been suggested to explain the\nacid neutralizing capacity of the organic matter, such as:\nH+ ion adsorption on the surface of organic matter (HOYT\n&amp; TURNER, 1975); exchangeable reaction between soil OH-\n\nwith organic anion (HUE &amp; AMIEN, 1989); and reduction\nreactions envolving N-cycling (HOYT &amp; TURNER, 1975;\nHUE, 1992). Recent reports have found that plant materials\nwith high basic cation contents are more efficient in\nneutralizing soil acidity than those with low contents\n\n\n\nFIORETTO, R. A. et al.2070\n\nCi\u00eanc. agrotec., Lavras, v. 33, Edi\u00e7\u00e3o Especial, p. 2069-2074, 2009\n\n(MIYAZAWA et al., 1993; POCKNEE &amp; SUMNER, 1997).\nIn fact, Cassiolato et al. (2002) showed that there is a linear\nrelationship between soil pH and plant residue basic\ncation content. However, it is accepted that the quality\nof the organic matter measured as its total basic cations\nis very important in the amelioration of soil acidity (MEDA\net al., 2001; SUMNER &amp; PAVAN, 2000). The aim of this\nstudy was to evaluate the influence of sugar cane straw\non   soil acidity and on wheat root elongation used as\ntest plant.\n\nSugar cane straw composed by stem and leaves\n(Saccarum sp., RB85-5536 variety) was collected in the\nfield at Usina de A\u00e7ucar &amp; Alcool - Cooperativa\nAgropecu\u00e1ria de Rol\u00e2ndia (COROL), in Rol\u00e2ndia, state of\nParan\u00e1, Brazil. Plant materials were dried at 65\u00baC  for 48 h,\nground to pass 1 mm sieve, stored in paper boxes, and\nthen used for the following chemical analysis: plant nutrient\ncontents (MIYAZAWA et al., 1992); basic cation excess\n(PIERRE &amp; BANWART, 1973); acidity neutralizing\ncapacity (MIYAZAWA et al., 1993); and H+ adsorption\ncapacity using a titration curve (YOUNG et al., 1981). The\nplant extract was obtained using the procedure described\nby Meda et al. (2001) and analyzed.\n\nSoil samples taken from the 0-25 cm depth of a Typic\nHarplortox (U.S. Soil Taxonomy) were air dried, ground\nand passed through a 2  mm sieve. The soil had an original\npH\n\nCaCl2 \nvalue of 4.1;  exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and Al\n\ncontents of 1.04, 0.43, 0.46 , and 2.2 cmol\nc \ndm-3, respectively,\n\nand total organic carbon content of 10.8 g kg-1. The clay,\nsilt, and sand contents were: 787.2, 65.2, and 147.6g kg-1,\nrespectively. Columns (305 cm3) of rigid polyvinyl chlorid\n(PVC) were used. Soil samples were transferred to PVC\ncolumns and compacted to a homogeneous bulk density\n(mean of 1.0g cm-3). The sugar cane straw (1 mm sieve) was\nadded on the soil  surface at rates of 0, 20, 40, and 76g kg-\n1 of soil. These rates were added at the amount equivalent\nto neutralize KCl exchangeable Al (0.6, 1.3, and 2.5 cmol\ndm-3). The soil columns were brought to field capacity with\ndistilled water and incubated for 0 (initial), 7, 14, 45, and 90\ndays. At each time, deionized water was added in as amount\nequivalent to four porous volumes (122 mL per column) at\na rate of 0.5 ml min-1. Soil samples were taken at 0-5, 5-10,\n10-15, 15-20, and 20-25 cm depth, air dried, ground to pass\na 2 mm sieve, and analyzed for pH\n\nCaCl2 \n(0.01 mol L-1 CaCl\n\n2\n\nsuspension, 1:2.5 soil solution ratio, 1h shaking time); KCl\nexchangeable Al (1 mol L-1 KCl, 1:10 soil: solution ratio);\nand CuCl\n\n2\n exchangeable Al (OLIVEIRA et al., 1997). Al-\n\nKCl was assumed to be exchangeable inorganic Al; Al-\nCuCl\n\n2\n total exchangeable Al (organic + inorganic); and (Al-\n\nCuCl\n2\n) - (Al-KCl) exchangeable organic Al.\n\nA biological test was evaluated to verify the\ncapacity of sugar cane extract on acid soil amelioration\nand on root elongation using wheat (Anahuac cultivar)\nas indicator plant. The biological test was the same\ndescribed by Franchini et al. (2001). All treatments have\nthree replicates in a completly randomized block\ndesign.\n\nSugar cane straw presented the following chemical\nproperties: organic carbon 610g kg-1; total nitrogen 71.4\ncmol kg-1; base excess 200 cmol kg-1 ; total basic cations\n(Ca+Mg+K) 81.2 cmol kg-1 ; and hidrogen neutralizing\ncapacity 33 cmol kg-1. In according with Pierre &amp; Banwart\n(1973) sugar cane straw is classified as high potential in\nalleviating soil acidity due to its high base excess content.\nThe results also show that for each 100 cmol kg-1 of N\nabsorbed by sugar cane roots there is a base excess of 280\ncmol kg-1. Thus, this sugar cane straw present higher cation\ncontents than inorganic anion contents. If the electrical\nneutrality principle is required, the excess of cation must\nbe balanced with organic anions. In fact, there is a good\ncorrelation between base excess and organic anions in\nplant tissues (DEWIT et al., 1963).\n\nThe quality of sugar cane straw measured as its\nacid neutralizing capacity was an important residue in the\namelioration of soil acidity after 90 days of incubation\n(Table 1). Increasing sugar cane straw rates increased\npH\n\nCaCl2 \nand organic carbon up to 15 cm soil depth and\n\ndecreased KCl exchangeable acidity (H+Al) up to 25 cm\nsoil depth. These results confirm the high acidity\nneutralizing capacity of sugar cane straw based as its high\nbase excess content.\n\nFigure 1 shows the effect of sugar cane on soil\npH\n\nCaCl2 \nas functions of rates, soil depth, and incubation\n\ntime. Soil pH\nCaCl2  \n\nincreased with increasing sugar cane\nrates mainly in the first 7 days incubation and then\ndecreased with increasing time. These effects were more\nevident in the 0-10 cm soil depth. Similar results were\nobtained by Miyazawa et al. (1993) and Pocknee &amp; Sumner\n(1997) on brazilian and north american soils, respectively\nwith different plant materials. There are at least two effects\non soil pH: first (short time effect, 7 days) a rapid pH\nincrease due to mineralization of basic cations in the\norganic material, high base excess, low N/basic cation\nratio and high H+ adsorption on the functional groups of\nthe organic compounds (RCOO- + H+ RCOO- H+); and\nsecond (medium time effect) pH increases due to the\norganic matter mineralization, where lime is liberated in\nproportion to the basic cation content (POCKNEE &amp;\nSUMNER, 1997).\n\n\n\nCi\u00eanc. agrotec., Lavras, v. 33, Edi\u00e7\u00e3o Especial, p. 2069-2074, 2009\n\nThe role of sugar cane straw on soil reaction 2071\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Effect of sugar cane straw rates on soil acidity and organic carbon contents as function of soil depth at 90 days\nincubation time.\n\n1Tukey (Rates)\n2Tukey (Depth)\n\nFigure 2 shows the effect of sugar cane straw on\nKCl-Al as functions of rates, soil depth, and incubation\ntime. At the top 0-5 cm soil layer, the highest sugar cane\nstraw rate neutralized totally KCl-Al. Increasing sugar cane\nrates decreased KCl-Al, and the effect was higher in the\nbegining of the experiment (0 to 7 days) than at the end (90\ndays) mainly in the top 15 cm soil layer. These results\n\nsupport the view that complexation of Al by organic\ncompounds is an important reaction for decreasing Al\ntoxicity [3 R-COO- K+ + Al+++ ? (R-COO-)3 Al\n\n++++ 3K+].\nWhen the pH is above 5.2, the Al-organic complexes\nprecipitate as Al(OH)3.

The contribution of organics to Al\nneutralization was about 72% in the 15 \u2013 20 cm in soil layer.\nThus, when organic strategy is adopted in sugar cane\nplantation, where all trashes are left on soil surface without\nburning, the organic compounds form complexes with Al.\nThe contribution of pH to Al detoxification increased with\ndecreasing sugar cane straw rates,  increasing sugar cane\nstraw rates from 0, 20, to 76 g kg-1 increased wheat root\nelongation (indicator plant) from 3.39, 10.26 to 15.71 cm,\nrespectively after 8 days. As expected, wheat root growth\nwas due to increase soil pH and decrease KCl - Al up to 15\ncm soil depth.
