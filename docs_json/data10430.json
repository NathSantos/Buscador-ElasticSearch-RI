Some of its associates, dissatisfied with the service were leaving the company. There were \n\nalso unsatisfied end-consumers with the lack of effectiveness and the waiting time of the service. The internal \n\nproblems aligned with a general economic crisis, rising of oil prices and the growth of the largest competitor \n\n(Autocoope) led Retalis president to propose the adoption of a new allocation of services system, the GSM/GPRS \n\nsystem.  \n\nThe company\u2019s deadlock in 2008 offers then a series of discussion possibilities on courses of strategy or \n\ninnovation. In addition to the case study, the dissertation also includes a literature review that contains the \n\nsuggested concepts and frameworks that can be used to analyze and assess the company\u2019s situation, internal \n\nand external environment and the new technology adoption impact. Finally the teaching note suggests an \n\napproach to the case that might be used to guide a class discussion or the preparation of it. \n\nThrough the case analysis it is possible to conclude that the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system can be \n\noptimal because it would improve Retalis performance and, above all, create a source of competitive advantage \n\nover competitors in the taxi industry. However, there were also some threats and barriers for the new system \n\nadoption like the economic crisis, the associates characteristics and a deeply rooted working culture. The strategy \n\nof the new system adoption will only succeed if the company is able to motivate most of its associates and to \n\nraise awareness of this change through a marketing campaign.   \n\nResumo \n \n\nT\u00edtulo: Retalis, Cooperativa R\u00e1dio T\u00e1xis Lisboa: O decl\u00ednio na ind\u00fastria do t\u00e1xi \n\nAutor: Diogo Gon\u00e7alo Sim\u00f5es Ant\u00e3o \n\nAp\u00f3s pouco mais de 30 anos de exist\u00eancia, a cooperativa Retalis enfrentava em 2008 uma das maiores \n\ncrises desde a sua funda\u00e7\u00e3o. Alguns dos seus associados, insatisfeitos com o servi\u00e7o prestado estavam a \n\nabandonar a empresa e existia igualmente uma procura de clientes insatisfeita com a efic\u00e1cia do pr\u00f3prio servi\u00e7o \n\ne o tempo de espera para ter um t\u00e1xi a sua porta. Os problemas internos alinhados a toda uma crise econ\u00f3mica \n\ngeral, o aumento dos pre\u00e7os do petr\u00f3leo e o crescendo de associados pela maior concorrente Autocoope fizeram \n\no seu presidente propor a adop\u00e7\u00e3o de um novo sistema de atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de servi\u00e7os, o sistema GSM/GPRS.  \n\nA situa\u00e7\u00e3o de impasse da empresa em 2008 oferece ent\u00e3o uma s\u00e9rie de possibilidades de discuss\u00e3o em \n\ncadeiras de estrat\u00e9gia ou de inova\u00e7\u00e3o. Para al\u00e9m do caso de estudo, a disserta\u00e7\u00e3o inclui tamb\u00e9m uma revis\u00e3o \n\nde literatura que cont\u00e9m a sugest\u00e3o de conceitos e ferramentas que podem ser utilizados para analisar e avaliar \n\na situa\u00e7\u00e3o da empresa, o ambiente interno, externo e o impacto da adop\u00e7\u00e3o de uma nova tecnologia. Por \u00faltimo, \n\na nota de ensino sugere uma abordagem ao caso que poder\u00e1 servir de base a uma discuss\u00e3o em aula ou \n\nprepara\u00e7\u00e3o para a mesma.  \n\nAtrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise do caso, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel concluir que a adop\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema GSM/GPRS poder\u00e1 ser \u00f3ptima \n\npois iria melhorar a performance e acima de tudo criar uma vantagem competitiva para com os competidores na \n\nind\u00fastria do t\u00e1xi. Contudo tamb\u00e9m existiam algumas amea\u00e7as e entraves h\u00e1 adop\u00e7\u00e3o deste novo sistema como \n\na crise econ\u00f3mica, as caracter\u00edsticas dos associados e toda uma cultura de trabalho extremamente enraizada. A \n\nestrat\u00e9gia de adoptar o novo sistema s\u00f3 ter\u00e1 sucesso se a empresa for capaz de motivar maior parte dos seus \n\nassociados e atrav\u00e9s de uma campanha de marketing dar a conhecer esta mudan\u00e7a. \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\nII \n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n \n\nThe exceptional possibility to interview Retalis president Jose Dionisio was crucial for the \n\ncompletion and accuracy of the dissertation. In a moment where he no longer belongs to the \n\ncompany\u2019s management, I have to thank his availability and openness to share its \n\nexperience as Retalis president. Furthermore I am also grateful to the current president \n\nPedro Lopes for the sharing information and for the opportunity to watch the new system \n\nworking process. \n\n \n\nI also must thank Nuno Magalh\u00e3es Guedes, the seminar advisor, for his support, \n\nfeedback and advice that helped me throughout the completion of the dissertation.  In \n\naddition, I am thankful for the opportunity to discuss my work with the colleagues from the \n\ndissertation seminar. \n\n \n\nUltimately, I must thank my family and friends, especially my parents, Idilia and Dinis, for \n\ntheir wise counseling, support and for all the opportunities that lead to this moment. I would \n\nlike to make a special mention, again, to my father Dinis for making it possible to contact the \n\ncompany.

Introduction \n\nFor more than thirty years, Retalis, the cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa has been \n\ncompeting in the taxi competitive industry and was the industry leader for several years. In \n\nthe beginning of 2008, the company had 1.316 million Euros in annual revenues and \n\ncontinued to be the largest Portuguese taxi cooperative and the market leader, despite \n\nworking only in the Lisbon area. But the company\u2019s situation had been worsening in the last \n\nyears and several challenges had appeared: the costs have been increasing, there were \n\nservice problems, several members were leaving the company, the information systems \n\nwere outdated and one of the main competitors, Autocoope, was growing, threatening \n\nRetalis leadership. The President Eng. Jose Dionisio and his team had too much to do, so \n\nthey proposed the adoption of a new system for the company that would solve some of the \n\nproblems in their perspective. \n\nThis dissertation aims then to analyze the company\u2019s performance in the market and also \n\nto discuss the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system and its implications for the future of \n\nRetalis. The Case Study (II) offers the opportunity for business strategy students to analyze \n\nand discuss two main issues: how the service provided by Retalis to both associates and \n\nclients was working and how the shift to a more recent system could help the company to \n\nsolve its problems. The result of the analysis, both individually and in class, enables to \n\naddress the key issue of the case: should Retalis adopt the GSM/GPRS system? \n\nHowever, the goal of this thesis is not only do describe Retalis but also to suggest, \n\nthrough a Literature Review (III), the theoretical frameworks and concepts that might be used \n\nin the study of the case. Finally, the dissertation includes a Teaching Note (IV) with a detailed \n\nexamination of Retalis past and future challenges with the aim of helping the instructor \n\npreparing and enhancing the class discussion. \n\nIf the adoption of the GSM/GPRS will bring a solution for the Retalis main problems only \n\ntime will tell. However, students may analyze and suggest what the company should do \n\nregarding the new system adoption. \n\n  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n2 \n \n\nII. Case Study \n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa \n\nThe decline in the taxi industry \n\n \n\nIn the beginning of 2008, Radio Taxis Lisboa or Retalis was the largest Portuguese \n\ncooperative company in the Taxi Industry with annual revenues of 1.316 million Euros. \n\nOperating only in the Lisbon area (a city with more than 2.5 million habitants where more \n\nthan 1 million cars circulate daily, exhibit 1 and 2), it had almost 50% of the market. However \n\nit only represented 22% of the number of taxis in Lisbon since there were 1810 cars that \n\nbelonged to individual owners or private associations. Retalis only had 790 cars from the \n\ntotal of 1740 that had a radio system. Despite the leadership in the market they were facing \n\nmany challenges: the costs had been increasing year after year, there was a problem in \n\nservice, several members were leaving the company and the information systems were \n\noutdated. Moreover, one of their main competitors, Autocoope, was growing in the number of \n\ncars and also in the number of services provided per day. \n\nEng. Jose Dionisio, the new president had much to worry about, including the need to \n\nimprove the 30 year old business system. He entered the company in 2006 as a member of \n\nthe financial board and tried to implement a couple of changes with no success, since he \n\nwas only the treasurer. Most of his ideas were not even approved within his team. Convinced \n\nthat he could contribute more to benefit the company, he broke out with the previous \n\ndirection and formed his own team for the elections of 2008. And he won them. \n\nHe knew that something needed to change at the company but it would not be easy. \n\nThere was a deeply rooted work culture since some of the members had more than thirty \n\nyears of affiliation. The new technology systems were an opportunity that should be \n\nexplored, having in mind, as Eng. Jose Dionisio said that:  \n\n\u201cTechnology is not an end, only a mean to an end. And that end is to please the people \n\nthat are involved with the company, from the customer to the taxi drivers and owners and the \n\noperators. It is necessary to show them that the change is positive to everyone\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n3 \n \n\nCompany History \n\n \n\nThe cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa (Retalis) was formed in 1977 by 50 partners that had \n\nthe ultimate goal of being the leader in the taxi transportation industry. The formation of this \n\ncooperative was a response to the creation of another one two years before (Autocoope), \n\nwhich was created by the members of the union of the taxi drivers. Autocoope had, at that \n\ntime, the ultimate idea of creating a radio taxi service. It was possible for the customers to \n\ncall for a taxi for the wanted address with no need to get out into the streets looking for one. \n\nThis innovative service was having great results and the other drivers that did not belong to \n\nthe company felt the need to create a similar service in order to have higher revenues, since \n\nit was not possible for the drivers that did not belong to the union, to be a part of the venture.  \n\nRetalis had a decentralized hierarchy (exhibit number 3), with three main divisions \n\nincluding the Direction responsible for the management of the company, the audit committee \n\nthat was in charge of the accounting and the general assembly that represented the taxi \n\nowners in the company and was responsible for managing the board meetings and \n\naddressing the associates grievances and requests. \n\nThe initial investment made by the partners in the acquisition of the equipment was \n\naround 46.000 escudos (230 Euros in the current currency) besides the cost of setting up the \n\ncompany. It was an high investment for that time and some of the partners could not arrange \n\nthe money to buy it. Of the 50 members that formed the company only 10 had the possibility \n\nto buy the radio system.  \n\nDespite the initial setback that the company went through in its first year of operation, it \n\nwas able to provide on average 4 services per car per day over the new radio service out of \n\na total of 30 services. Most of Retalis taxis work 24 hours per day, with two shifts of 12 hours \n\nof each driver. Watching the results, other taxi micro-companies started to join the company. \n\nIn 1986 the number of cars was five times higher than in the beginning, with a total of 250 \n\ncars. Each one was performing on average 38 services per day, 7 of them from the radio \n\nservice. Since throughout that year, the 250 existing cars were more than enough to respond \n\nto the radio generated demand, and new members were not accepted for a year. \n\nAfter that year, new entrances were allowed again and in 1991 there were already 410 \n\ncars in Retalis, which represented a growth of 82% in only four years. In the same year the \n\nRadio Taxis Lisboa social found was created, for which each car had to contribute with 3400 \n\nescudos (17 Euros in the actual currency). The found aimed to assist the members of the \n\ncompany in case of a big damage of their cars or if the acquisition of a new one was \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n4 \n \n\nnecessary. This support was granted through a very low interest loan (1% interest per \n\nmonth). \n\nIn 1994 a new type of revenue for the car owners was introduced. For the first time in \n\nPortugal, some of the Retalis cars showed in their exterior an advertisement for the new \n\nRenault Twingo that had just been launched in the Portuguese market. This allowed the \n\ndrivers to have extra revenue per month besides the regular services that they were \n\ndelivering. With a strategy of supporting their members and giving them new ways of making \n\nmoney, Retalis became an attractive company to work for and in the beginning of the new \n\nmillennium there were already 650 cars working with the company. The maximum number of \n\naffiliates was reached in 2006: 825 cars. Each car had on average 28 services per day, 8 of \n\nthem generated by the radio service. The average revenue was 7 Euros per service. \n\nAlthough the company had been growing since its foundation, there were two external \n\nfactors concerning the entire industry. The increase of the oil prices in the last years and the \n\nbeginning of an apparent world economic crises. In order to protect the company and its \n\nmembers an agreement was signed with the multinational gas company BP. The members of \n\nRetalis were entitled a discount of 6 cents per liter, while the company got one additional \n\ncent per liter. This was a way of making the members happy by saving some money and at \n\nthe same time increasing the revenues of the company.  \n\nDespite the effort of the company, the price of oil continued to grow (as it can be seen in \n\nexhibit 4), and the world economic crisis had really started, making the taxi industry less \n\nprofitable for the players and less attractive to new entrants. With the crisis and the high \n\ncosts of parking in some areas the population also began to circulate more on public \n\ntransportation such as Carris buses and Metro subways to save some costs (as it can be \n\nseen in exhibit 5 and 6). Until the entrance of Eng. Jose Dionisio direction, in the beginning of \n\n2008, there were no more admittance and some of the members started to leave the \n\ncompany. The majority of them preferred to continue the activity by their own or by moving to \n\nanother cooperative.  \n\nThe Situation in 2008 \n\n \n\nFor the first time in history, the company was not able to grow for the two previous years. \n\nFrom the peak (with 825 cars) in the beginning of 2006 to the entrance of the new direction in \n\n2008 there was no growth in the number of cars at the company. Even worse, there were \n\nsome members leaving, because they felt that there was no return in the fee (30\u20ac per month \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n5 \n \n\nper car) that they had to pay to the company in order to have the radio system. With fewer \n\ncars working with the company the revenues went down. All the company revenues are \n\ndirectly linked to the number of existing cars, the mensal fees paid, the discount per liter in \n\nBP gas station, a percentage of the advertisement made by other companies in the cars, and \n\nalso a percentage in the credit service. This credit service consists on agreements to allow \n\ncompanies or regular clients to pay the services at the end of the month. Retalis charged an \n\nextra percentage over the total of the services provided to the different clients.  \n\nOne of the main tasks of the company was handling the credit services for the associates. \n\nIt received the payment from clients at the end of each month and then it would repay the \n\nassociate who provided the service. In the end of 2007 the payment of credit services \n\nreached almost 885.000 Euros. The other big costs of the company were the salaries of the \n\ncentral workers, the direction travels and communication (as it can be seen in exhibit number \n\n7). There were no costs regarding the marketing of the company for the attraction of new \n\nassociates, trusting only in the word of mouth among taxi drivers and clients. \n\n-Industry competion  \n\nOne of Retalis main competitors, Autocoope, had been growing in the past years \n\nthreatening the leadership of the company in the taxi industry (as it can be seen in exhibit \n\nnumber 8). Until 1996 Autocoope followed the policy of not let anyone enter in the company \n\nkeeping the exclusivity of it 150 members. The business model of this cooperative was \n\ncompletely different from the one used by Retalis: the cars belonged to Autocoope and not to \n\nmicro-companies. So they supported all the costs of the 150 cars, like diesel costs, car \n\nmaintenance and the drivers\u2019 salary. This model of business was completely ineffective and it \n\nwas losing money year after year. With the entrance of the new president the policy had \n\nchanged. He decided to sell the cars to the drivers at a low cost and they were responsible \n\nfor the exploration of the car. They supported the costs and got the revenues, having just to \n\npay a mensal fee similar to the value in Retalis. The president also decided that it was \n\nimportant to increase the number of cars, so he opened the company to new members. The \n\nmain differences from the Retalis model, was that they did not have to pay an entrance fee to \n\njoin the company but they would not get diesel discounts or other extra benefits. They run a \n\nmarketing campaign among the taxi drivers (something that Retalis never did, trusting only in \n\nthe word of mouth), to attract them to the company. With these measures Autocoope started \n\nto grow, threatening the leadership of Retalis. \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n6 \n \n\nIn 2008 there were 3550 taxis working in the Lisbon area, where 790 where from Retalis, \n\n600 from Autocoope, 350 from Teletaxis (another cooperative) and the remaining from \n\nindividual owners or small groups of associations, like \u201cTaxis do Lumiar\u201d or \u201cTaxis do \n\nRestelo\u201d \n1\n. \n\nThe main difficulty felt by Retails in attracting customers was the expansion of public \n\ntransportation. The economic crisis led the population to prefer public transportation for the \n\ndaily movements along the City. \n\nIn 2002 the bus company Carris started a renewal of its fleet. With this renewal the buses \n\nbecame more comfortable, more hygienic, with air conditioning and with more seats. Carris \n\nnot only renewed the buses, but also their distribution. The maximum waiting time anywhere \n\nin the city was listed to 30 minutes. \n\nWith better buses reaching all parts of the city, whit normal waiting times between buses \n\nof 7 or 10 minutes, and with convenient links with other mean of transport Carris began to \n\ngain the trust of customers who saw there an alternative to the use of taxi. \n\nIt was not just Carris that led customers to use public transportation as an alternative to \n\ntaxi. The development of the Metro was another reason. \n\nIn 2008, the Metro had four lines that were divided into several areas covering not only the \n\nmetropolitan area of Lisbon but also areas outside the city as Amadora and Odivelas for \n\nexample. The Metro had become a real choice because it was faster, with little waiting time \n\nand with stations all along the city. By reaching areas in the suburbs the Metro allowed daily \n\ntrips by customers who did not live in the city center but had to move daily to study or work. \n\nCar commuters take twice as long to get to the city because of traffic congestion problems. \n\nAlso the costs of using the car daily have been increasing in the last years. The increase of \n\noil prices and the increase of parking costs in some Lisbon areas made some people to \n\nprefer the public transportation instead of the individual car. \n\nAt that time the percentage of people that used public transportation daily was around \n\n57%. From this percentage only 4% use the taxi while the rest used other means like Metro \n\nor Carris. Relatively to individual transportation it corresponds to 41%. \n\nOver the years Retalis had been taking measures targeted to the associates, like the BP \n\nagreement, the advertisements and other measures, whose main beneficiary was the \n\nassociate himself and not the final customer. The new direction knew that something needed \n\nto change in the company, and the main questions according to Jose Dionisio were:  \n\n                                                             \n1\n Lumiar and Restelo are neighborhoods within the city of Lisbon; \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n7 \n \n\n\u201cWhere to go? What changes should be implemented? Should the company renew the \n\nwhole fleets of taxis? Renew the drivers? Change the way they operate? Or re-think the \n\nentire philosophy of the company?\u201d \n\nAfter an analysis of the company, the new direction identified that the radio system was \n\nobsolete. It had been the same system over the past 30 years and fewer changes have been \n\nmade since the beginning which made it ineffective for the modern times. There were several \n\ncalls arriving at the central asking for a taxi but it was only possible to find a taxi for one \n\ncustomer at a time and the whole procedure could take several minutes. This made some \n\ncustomers to be unsatisfied for the time and money spent on the call or even to give up \n\nwaiting. \n\n-The Radio Taxis phone Service \n\nBesides the regular taxi service that consists of picking up customers randomly on the \n\nstreets or on the taxi stands, Retalis also provides to its members a radio service that helps \n\nthem to get a service without the need of driving around the city looking for customers.  \n\nThis radio service requires a series of steps which involves the customer, a Retalis \n\noperator and the taxis on duty. Although picking up a taxi for a customer seems a quite \n\nsimple task, it requires background work since the call from the customer until the taxi gets to \n\nhis/her door.  \n\nThe first step is done by the customer, when he makes the decision of calling the \n\ncompany asking for a taxi to the wanted address. After that the operator takes note of the \n\naddress and announces in the radio that a customer is requiring a taxi into a certain address. \n\nIn this process all the Retalis cars listen to the announcement either if they are available or if \n\nthey are driving a client. \n\nThe next step is taken by the taxi drivers. After listening to the announcement of the \n\noperator, the cars that are near the address apply for the service, once at a time. In the \n\napplication the driver has to give his location (address where he is) in order for the other \n\ndrivers to know if it is worth to apply for the service, in case they are nearer. Since there is no \n\ndevice to ensure that the taxi driver is giving the correct information about his location, the \n\nonly option is to trust the drivers\u2019 word. However, there were several stories of lies, with a \n\ndriver saying that he was in a given location and another one seeing him in a different one. \n\nThis type of events happened a lot of times, which contributed to the image of the taxi drivers \n\nas being tricky people that do everything to get more money. After the different applications, \n\nthe car that is closer to the client\u2019s address wins the service and drives to meet the customer. \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n8 \n \n\nAt the same time the operator, which is also listening to the taxi radio, communicates to the \n\ncustomer that number \u201cxxx\u201d is on the way to meet him. The decision of which is the closest \n\ncar is not always clear. In case of doubt there is a decision commission, chosen in advance, \n\ncomposed by other taxi drivers that decide what car should take the required service based \n\non the address that they gave before. This commission has the power to replace the car that \n\nwas previously indicated for the service by another one that also applied, if they think that the \n\nsecond one is closer to the customer\u2019s address. In this case, when the new car indicated for \n\nthe service arrives has to inform the customer that he comes in place of the taxi number told \n\nby the operator. From this moment on the steps of the radio service are over and the regular \n\nservice provided by taxis begins. \n\nThis was a long process that required a lot of attention and cooperation between the \n\nintervenients in order to avoid mistakes and keep the customer satisfied. \n\nLast year performance showed that the taxi service had stagnated and the average \n\nnumber of services, both over the radio and not, were worse than the one\u00b4s from twenty \n\nyears ago (according to the information on the exhibit 9). For the maturity of this service \n\ncontributes, according to Eng. Jose Dionisio, \u201cthe time spent on the different steps and, most \n\nof all, because it was only possible to manage one request at a time, creating a funnel effect \n\n(figure A). With this, there was no possibility of growth with the use of this 30 year-old \n\nsystem\u201d. \n\nFigure A- The Funnel effect \n\n \n\nOne service assigned at a \ntime \n\nOne \napplication \nin the radio \n\n6/7 \noperatores \nanswering \n\nthe calls \n\nDozens of \nclients \n\ncalling for a \ntaxi \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n9 \n \n\n\u201cThe need to adapt the system to the state-of-art technologies was something that should \n\nbe explored. Society was already in the 3G era and the company had stopped 30 years in \n\nthe past\u201d, according to the new president.  \n\nSome electronic systems had already been implemented in other countries with great \n\nresults. The president felt the need to do something similar in his company in order to update \n\nthe system, making it more effective, and to satisfy the customers.  \n\nHowever, he knew that it would not be easy to implement, because there were associates \n\nwith more than 30 years of affiliation to the company. They were used to work with the old \n\nsystem and, with their low level of education, some of the members looked to these new \n\ntechnological systems in a distrustful and skeptical way. It was necessary to show them that \n\nthis would be a good investment that would be profitable in the future because it will allow \n\nthem to generate more services and with that more revenues. Taxi drivers were not the only \n\nones who would be affected by the changes. It was necessary to show to the operators and \n\nthe remaining employees that nobody was going to lose their jobs and, on the contrary, their \n\nwork would be facilitated. \n\n-The GSM/GPRS system \n\nBefore the decision of what should be implemented, several systems were analyzed in \n\norder to see which one had the functionalities that would fit better with the characteristics of \n\nthe company and its culture. Also the system should be an easy one to work with, because of \n\nthe type of people that were going to use it.  \n\nThe chosen system was the GSM/GPRS, a system that included treating information over \n\nmobile voice (listen and speak, GSM) and data on the same electronic band (GPRS). This \n\nwas a user friendly system that had already been implemented in Madrid some years ago.  \n\nThe treatment of the information provided by all the intervenients would be treated \n\nelectronically, instead of the voice in the previous system. The first step would be made by \n\nthe customer, when he/she calls Retalis asking for a taxi to a certain address. After hearing \n\nthe customer, the operator just had to input in the system the address and it would \n\nautomatically identify the nearest free car over the GPS system. Then the number of the car \n\nthat is going to pick him/her is communicated to the customer. The next time that the \n\ncustomer calls from the same number the system would automatically identify the address \n\nfrom the previous call (each number can have up to 6 addresses register). \n\nWhen the system identifies the closest car it shows up in that car system device the \n\ninformation of the address of the client and the driver has 20 seconds to press the button to \n\naccept the service. If in 20 seconds the driver does not press any button, the system \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n10 \n \n\nautomatically passes the service to the second nearest car and so on. With this new system \n\nit would be possible to find a car for a customer in seconds instead of minutes, allowing the \n\nclient to save time and money on the call. At the same time, this new system will eliminate \n\nthe funnel effect of the previous system, since it would be possible to assign more than one \n\nservice at a time, making the radio service at Retalis more effective. \n\nBecause this was a system that would be expensive to implement, and since it was a \n\ncooperative venture, it was necessary to approve the proposal in the general meeting with \n\nmore than 50% of the votes from the associates. The implementation of the new system \n\nwould cost 1 million Euros divided by the different associates (1400 Euros per car), so it was \n\nnecessary to show them that the investment would be worth it in the near future.  \n\nWhat to do next? \n\n \n\nThere was a need to change. It was necessary to stop members to resign and to attract \n\nmore associates to the company. In the past years, the main focus of the company was to \n\nplease the associates, making agreements to get them more revenues or to reduce their \n\ncosts. This new direction was proposing a different approach. It was necessary to think about \n\nthe clients and their satisfaction in order to get more services and revenues for the \n\nassociates.  \n\nIn this new point of view the GSM/GPRS system was the right way to go. This new system \n\nwould allow the elimination of the company bottleneck and provide a better service for the \n\nclient, with no need of staying several minutes on the phone waiting for the service to be \n\nattributed. Instead, in some seconds, it was possible to know the car number that was on the \n\nway to the required address. In Eng. Jose Dionisio opinion: \u201cThis was an opportunity that \n\nshould be taken, and by being the first cooperative to adopt this service, we would get a first-\n\nmover advantage which is very important in every business\u201d. \n\nHowever, the implementation of the service was not going to be easy. There were several \n\nassociates against it: the fear of the change, the work style deeply rooted and the investment \n\nneeded for the change were the main reasons for the doubts about the adoption of the \n\nservice. Also most of the people that were in the Taxi business (taxi owners and workers) \n\nhad low-medium college instruction and were old. They look for the new technologies with \n\ndistrust. It was necessary to show to the taxi owners that with this service it was possible to \n\nincrease the revenues and reduce the empty kilometers (traveled without clients, exhibit 10) \n\nand show to the taxi drivers that their average salary of 700 Euros could increase. \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n11 \n \n\nMoreover, Retalis was a cooperative enterprise with hundreds of associates and it was \n\nhard to convince all of them about the advantages of the new system. And the ones that \n\nwere against the new system and the investment of almost 1 million Euros were free to leave \n\nthe company and join another cooperative or work by their own. Large investments were \n\nfeared mainly because of the crisis that was felt at national level. Also it was necessary to \n\ngive training to every taxi driver, taxi owner and operator in the period of transition to the new \n\nservice.  \n\nThe president knew that some members were against the new system and they would \n\nleave the company if the proposal was accepted. So he asked himself several questions: \n\n\u201cShould we move to this system or try to find a less expensive one? Is this the right time to \n\nimplement the system? Or should we move to a different kind of restructuring?\u201d \n\nDespite the threats, innovation and the possibility of growth were an opportunity that the \n\ndirection did not want to miss. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n12 \n \n\nExhibits \n\nExhibit 1- Lisbon Population until 2008 \n\n \n\nPopulation Portugal Lisbon Great Lisbon \n\n2008 10.627.250 789.975 2.029.458 \n\n2007 10.617.575 782.786 2.025.628 \n\n2006 10.599.095 774.697 2.019.529 \n\n2005 10.569.592 766.172 2.012.925 \n\n2004 10.529.255 757.113 2.003.584 \n\n \n\nSource: INE, \n\nhttp://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&amp;xpgid=ine_indicadores&amp;indOcorrCod=0000611&amp;c\n\nontexto=pi&amp;selTab=tab0 \n\nExhibit 2- Number of vehicles registered in Lisbon in 2008 \n\n \n\n  Individual cars Comercial cars Public transportation Motos  Total  \n\nLisbon 1 013 728 203 470 2 436 93 066 1 312 700 \n \n\nSource: http://www.autoinforma.pt/estatisticas/estatisticas.html?MIT=36458 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&amp;xpgid=ine_indicadores&amp;indOcorrCod=0000611&amp;contexto=pi&amp;selTab=tab0\nhttp://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&amp;xpgid=ine_indicadores&amp;indOcorrCod=0000611&amp;contexto=pi&amp;selTab=tab0\nhttp://www.autoinforma.pt/estatisticas/estatisticas.html?MIT=36458\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n13 \n \n\nExhibit 3- Company structure of governing bodies \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource:  2007 Retalis annual report  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGeneral Meeting \n\nPresident \n\nVice-\nPresident \n\n1st Secretary \n\n2nd \nSecretary \n\nAudit Comitee \n\n1st Member \n\n2nd Member \n\n3th Member \n\nDirection \n\nPresident \n\nVice-\nPresident \n\nTreasurer \n\nSecretary \n\nMember \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n14 \n \n\nExhibit 4- Evolution of oil prices \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: http://www.mongabay.com/images/commodities/charts/crude_oil.html \n\n \n\nExhibit 5- Carris demand per year until the end of 2007 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Carris website http://www.carris.pt/pt/indicadores-de-actividade/ \n\nTotal public service 2004 2005 2006 2007 \n\nPassengers (millions) 256,6 240,8 234,9 236,4 \n\nPassengers x Km \n\n(millions) 850 796 776 768,9 \n\nhttp://translate.google.pt/translate?hl=pt-PT&amp;langpair=en%7cpt&amp;u=http://www.mongabay.com/images/commodities/charts/crude_oil.html\nhttp://www.carris.pt/pt/indicadores-de-actividade/\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nExhibit 6- Metro Demand per year \n\n \n\nYear \n\nPassenger x km \n\n(millions) \n\nAverage circuit r \n\npassenger (km) \n\nCoeficient of \n\noccupation (%) \n\n2007 862,3 4,65 22,59 \n\n2006 855,5 4,65 22,14 \n\n2005 862,3 4,65 22,08 \n\n2004 801,2 4,46 21,22 \n\n2003 739,7 4,2 22,52 \n\n2002 757,5 4,2 23,07 \n\n \n\nSource:  Metro Website \n\nhttp://www.metrolisboa.pt/Default.aspx?tabid=115&amp;SY=2002&amp;EY=2008 \n\nExhibit 7: Costs and Revenues in 2007 \n\n \n\nCOSTS \n\n Services 884.496,86 \u20ac \n\nCosts of the Central 19.186,52 \u20ac \n\nCommunication 18.541,49 \u20ac \n\nDirection travels 49.275,20 \u20ac \n\nSpecialized works 31.328,64 \u20ac \n\nSalaries and Social   \n\nSecurity 232.269,80 \u20ac \n\nOther 51.658,78 \u20ac \n\nTOTAL 1.286.757,29 \u20ac \n\n \n\nSource: 2007 Retalis annual Report \n\n \n\n \n\nREVENUES \n\n Affiliation fee 278.466,84 \u20ac \n\nServices 1.011.690,71 \u20ac \n\nInterest 2.316,16 \u20ac \n\nEntrance fee 3.790,88 \u20ac \n\nOther 34.119,04 \u20ac \n\nTOTAL 1.330.383,63 \u20ac \n\nhttp://www.metrolisboa.pt/Default.aspx?tabid=115&amp;SY=2002&amp;EY=2008\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n16 \n \n\nExhibit 8- Evolution of number of taxis in Lisbon \n\n \n\n  Retalis Autocoope Teletaxis Taxis with radio  Taxis without radio Total \n\n1975 -

Literature Review \n\n1. Competitive advantages and Strategic Management \n\n \n\nThe strategy of a company is based on a balanced and rational management of its \n\nresources to create competitive advantages that enable the creation of value. Only, through \n\na strategic positioning it will be possible to obtain products or services that will satisfy the \n\ncustomer\u2019s needs and desires in a better way than the competition, according to Michael \n\nPorter (1996). \n\nA strategy is needed to promote consistency, define an organization, reduce uncertainty, \n\nbe ahead of competition, and involve everyone in the company and most of all to define the \n\ndirection to go, according to Mintzberg (1987). According to this author, there are five \n\ndimensions for a strategy that complement each other and help in the clarification of the \n\nconcept. The dimensions are: \n\n1. Strategy as a plan: A set of guidelines to be followed for a specific situation. In this \n\ncase, the strategy is developed in a purposeful and conscientious way and is done \n\nbefore the actions to which it applies are carried out; \n\n \n\n2. Strategy as a ploy: A set of maneuvers that aim to overcome a competitor; \n\n \n\n3. Strategy as a pattern: It emerges from the adopted behaviors, whether they are \n\nintentional or not; \n\n \n\n4. Strategy as a position: The way that the company is positioned in its environment. \n\nThe strategy thus become the mediating force between the internal and the \n\nexternal context of the company; \n\n \n\n5. Strategy as a perspective: The way that the company looks to the world around it. \n\nThe vision is shared between all the employees, through their actions and \n\nintentions. \n\n \n\nTo define a strategy it is necessary to understand the long-term goals and objectives of \n\nthe company, taking into account the environment in which it operates. Basically you should \n\ntry to understand what is the way that the company wants to follow, taking into account its \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n19 \n \n\nresources and internal operations, and external factors of its environment like economics and \n\ndemographics, political legal, socio-cultural, technological and ecological , among others. \n\nMost of the companies develop their management based on the budget and operational \n\nplan, focusing only in the financial performance. With the several economical and social \n\nchanges, and with competition based on information, the capacity of exploring intangible \n\nassets has become much more important than the capacity of managing tangible assets. \n\nThe management tools must provide all the elements that enable the identification and \n\nsustainability of the competitive advantages of the company, in an environment that is \n\nconstantly changing and is very competitive. \n\nThomas Wheelen and J. David Hunger (2006), consider that strategic management \n\ninvolves four steps: financial planning, external guidance, forecasting and the strategy \n\nplanning. On the other hand strategic management includes other four fundamental \n\nelements: environmental analysis, strategy formulation, strategy implementation and \n\nmonitoring and control. \n\n2. Environmental analysis \n\n2.1 PESTEL Analysis \n\nThe internal and external environment should be examined in a thorough way, because \n\nonly in that way it is possible to define a global strategy for the company. For Thomas \n\nWheelen e J. David Hunger (2006), the external environment analysis could be done through \n\na PESTEL analysis, which will help identify the external factors that influence the \n\nperformance of the company in the market.  \n\n-Political: Policies on the political framework where the company is involved; \n\n-Economical: economical and demographic factors that influence the company; \n\n-Social- Life-style: social values and educational level; \n\n-Technological: evolution of science that influence the company activities and the \n\ndevelopment of new products or processes; \n\n-Environmental: Involvement and commitment with the environment and social \n\nresponsibility; \n\n-Legal: Related to the legal environment where the company operates  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n20 \n \n\n2.2 Porter Five Forces \n\nFor Michael Porter (1980) the essential factor that influences more the company activity is \n\nthe sector of activity where it is inserted or the group of sectors where the company \n\ncompetes. The intensity of the competition depends on five forces: bargaining power of \n\nbuyers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes and rivalry \n\namong competition.  \n\nAccording to Michael Porter (1980) the bargaining power of buyers allows them to exert a \n\npressure on the sector, making the margins lower and obtaining products and services of \n\nbetter quality. This power can be influenced by several characteristics like the number of \n\nplayers in the market, having an undifferentiated product or service and the search of better \n\nprices. \n\nFor Porter (1980), the larger the size of the supplier the greater is the supplier negotiation \n\npower. The concentration of suppliers, lack of inputs and substitutes and high switching costs \n\nare conditions that ensure a higher bargaining power of suppliers.   \n\nThe threat of new entrants is related to economies of scale, high capital requirements, \n\nproduct differentiation, restricted access to distribution channels, technology and specific \n\nknow-how.  \n\nThe pressure of substitute products, that have the same use as the product of a particular \n\nsector that satisfy the same client needs, influences the prices of the industry and its \n\nimportance increases according to the appetence of customers for the substitution. The \n\nexistence of substitute products limits the gains of the companies of that industry, because it \n\nhas to maintain competitive prices. Thereby the degree of attractiveness of the industry \n\ndecreases.  \n\nThe rivalry among existing firms is influenced by all the aspects mentioned before. The \n\nnumber of competitors, product differentiation, switching costs, exit barriers and the diversity \n\nof companies are all aspects that condition the competitiveness of an industry. \n\n2.3 SWOT Analysis \n\nThe internal analysis shows that in most cases, although the market trends are the same \n\nfor the several companies that belong to a certain sector, the results obtained by them are \n\ndifferent from each other. This situation happens because of the different management \n\ncapabilities of each company and the efficient use of its resources.  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n21 \n \n\nThomas Wheelen and J. David Hunger (2006) believe that it is necessary, at an internal \n\nlevel, to analyze the core and differentiated competences of each company, in order to \n\ncreate competitive advantages and a strong organizational culture. For Mintzberg (1988) we \n\nshould also analyze the company structure, internal resources and competences and the \n\nculture and operations of the company. In order to achieve success it is necessary to create, \n\ndevelop and sustain competitive advantages that allow them to keep the leadership in the \n\nmarkets where they operate. In the internal analysis, could be used the SWOT analysis, \n\ncombining the strengths and weaknesses of the company with the threats and opportunities \n\nof the market. \n\n3. Strategy formulation \n\n3.1 Aligned Strategy with Vision and Mission \n\nIt is necessary to know the vision and mission of a company to outline a strategy. The \n\nvision projects how the company wants to be seen by society while pursuing its mission. It \n\ninfluences the performance of the employees that by feeling identified with the goals of the \n\ncompany will become more motivated to work there. This will benefit also the performance of \n\nthe company.   \n\nThe mission must be seen as a long-term guide of the company, that hardly changes and \n\nthat should not be a specific goal or a strategic action. Every company should have its own \n\nidentity and values. Throughout the definition of strategy, the company establishes its goals \n\nand the direction that should be taken to achieve those goals. All the goals should be \n\nmeasurable, specific, tangible, result oriented and defined in time.  \n\nFor Peter Drucker (2000) there are five phenomena that should be considered in the \n\nformulation of a strategy, because they are the known factors of the external environment. \n\nThese phenomena are a consequence of large changes in the society and they are the new \n\nparameters in the definition of performance, decreasing of birth rate in the developed \n\ncountries, global competition, lack of accompaniment between the economic globalization \n\nand politics and the changes in utilization of incomes.  \n\nFor Robert Kaplan and David Norton (2000) the companies that are strategy oriented \n\nshould adopt 5 principles: align the strategy with the organization, set the strategy in an \n\noperational way, involve everyone in the company with the strategy, convert it into a \n\ncontinuous process and mobilize the change.  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n22 \n \n\n3.2 Competitive Advantage \n\nAccording to Michael Porter (1980) there are three types of strategies that create \n\ncompetitive advantage:  \n\nCost Strategy: where the company concentrates its efforts in productive efficiency, \n\nproduction growth and in minimization of costs like advertising, distribution or R&amp;D. In this \n\ntype of strategy the main advantage is the price that is extremely competitive and is a factor \n\nof attractiveness for the consumer. On the other hand, the risks of this strategy are the threat \n\nof new competitors with a more advanced technology that can produce at a lower cost and \n\nthe market can rapidly change and value other features in the product beside the price.  \n\nDifferentiation: The Company invests in areas like image, R&amp;D, new technologies or \n\nquality of a certain product or service in order to differentiate from the competition. The main \n\nadvantage of this strategy is that it creates differentiated criteria recognized in the market, \n\nwhich creates value for the product or service. In terms of risks the main ones are the high \n\nprice and possibility of ignoring other criteria of the market.  \n\nFocus: In this strategy the company chooses a restrict target and trough differentiation or \n\ncost, concentrates its goals in the satisfaction of that specific segment or niche. The main \n\nadvantage is the possibility of identifying clearly the clients and consumers for that product or \n\nservice. On the other hand the chosen segment may not sustain the operation of the \n\ncompany.  \n\n4. Strategy Implementation \n\n \n\nIn order to achieve the five principles suggested, according to Robert Kaplan and David \n\nNorton (2000) there are some actions that must be developed: the strategy should be \n\npresented for every worker in the company, in a simple and creative way, in order to motivate \n\nthem and make them work aligned with the defined strategy; it is necessary to align the \n\nstrategy and communication between all the departments of the company, in order to \n\nachieve common goals; look at the strategy as a learning process in order to get some \n\nfeedback; and make a big effort to do the necessary changes.  \n\nAfter a careful internal and external analysis of the company and the industry and look at \n\nthe social-political phenomena it is possible to formulate hypothesis and then choose the \n\nright strategy to follow. \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n23 \n \n\nWith the fast and unexpected economic and social context changes, some authors \n\nsuggest a more intuitive approach and a lower level of planning when the companies have to \n\ndecide which strategy should be implemented. In Gary Hamel (1996) opinion companies \n\nshould take advantage of its core competences in order to achieve the set objectives.  \n\nAccording to Hamel (1996) the efforts of the companies, in the recent years, have been \n\nfocused on the inside, where its aim is to improve performance and be at the same level of \n\nthe competitors in the competitive parameters. But from this author point of view the \n\ncompanies are doing it wrong, they should be trying to achieve better capabilities, which will \n\nallow creating new markets. Hamel (1996) also defends that competition will influence the \n\nfuture business opportunities and do not see it as a player in the sector to split the profits.  \n\nFor Hamel (1996) there are two types of companies, the ones that will possible suffer \n\nsome difficulties in the future because they have not adopted significantly changes, and the \n\nones that deal well with organizational changes, trying to understand what will happen in the \n\nfuture and trying to adapt their strategy to it.  \n\nThe managers feel the need to anticipate the changes in the external environment and \n\ncustomer\u2019s behavior in order to choose the right strategy for the company. All the decisions \n\nrelated to the future prediction are the hardest ones to take. The need to anticipate future \n\nscenarios generates changes in the organizations (Hayes and Garvin 1982). \n\nThomas Wheelen and J. David Hunger (2006) believe that for successful strategies it is \n\nnecessary to define procedures, processes and implement action-oriented programs. \n\nThroughout the different steps it is necessary to get some feedback, in order to check if the \n\nimplemented strategy is the right one to achieve the goals set by the company.  \n\n4.1. Monitoring and Control \n\nAfter the implementation of the strategy comes the monitoring and control. The traditional \n\nsystems in most companies are based on financial indicators that result from the variables \n\nthat were on the budget. These budgets are based on the sales, costs, results and \n\nprofitability which are important information but do not guarantee the future success of the \n\ncompany. Through the analysis of non-financial data it is possible to know the customer \n\nsatisfaction, the quality of service provided, the reception level of the market to the \n\nintroduction of a new product and how new technologies are being used, among other \n\naspects, whether they are key success factors for the company\u2019s future success (Kaplan and \n\nNorton, 1996). \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n24 \n \n\nThe measures chosen to evaluate the company performance should be strategically \n\nrelevant, taking into account the future activities and the time and resources allocated to the \n\ninformation processing. With monitoring and control of the implemented strategy it is possible \n\nto know how the strategy is being implemented and if it is going in the right way in order to \n\nachieve the required goals (Kaplan and Norton, 1996). \n\nThe goal of feedback processes is to know if the set objectives have been achieved, not \n\nonly at the company level, but also at the different departments and employees\u2019 level. These \n\nprocesses are extremely useful for the strategy planning, to generate learning and have the \n\ncapacity to improve constantly.  \n\n5. The Relation of Innovation with Business Performance \n\n \n\nTechnological innovations are a key success factor for the future of the organizations. On \n\none hand they are a source of creativity that allows the companies to grow, and on the other \n\nhand they are a destructive force that can put the company in a dangerous position in \n\ncomparison with its competitors (Utterback, 1994). \n\nChristensen and Bower (1995) defend that in the business world it is almost impossible for \n\na company to remain leader of a certain sector when there is a technological change or a \n\nmarket evolution. The market is always evolving and it is essential for companies to \n\nunderstand that evolution and create new technologies in order to remain competitive. \n\nAlthough it is important to be careful with innovation, it can challenge the current company \n\nknowledge and positioning in the market.   \n\nFor Porter (1985) innovation is also very important for the success of an organization. But \n\ninnovation is not a competitive advantage by itself. It is only a source of generating \n\ncompetitive advantages in the company.  \n\n5.1. S-Curve \n\nThe S-curve is a tool frequently used to analyze competition and technological innovation \n\n(Callahan, 2007). It is extremely useful to understand how technology is performing and \n\nanticipate when the change for a new one is needed, because every technology has its life-\n\ncycle. And new technologies with better performance are always appearing.  \n\nThe S-curve is determined in its vertical axis by the technology performance and in its \n\nhorizontal axis by the effort or money invested in a certain technology, using time to measure \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n25 \n \n\nthem. As the time of implementation goes by the technology performance tends to improve, \n\nbecause in the initial state the functionalities are not that well understood and not working at \n\nits maximum. For Foster (1982) during the initial state the effort is applied in a limited \n\ntechnology improvement and then, only when the knowledge is acquired and established, \n\nprogress increases until it reaches the limit. When reaching this limit the improvements start \n\nto be lower until they drop to zero. When this process is closer to its maturity, it becomes \n\nmore vulnerable and subject to the substitution of a new technology process. \n\nFor Christensen (2003) the S-curve is a useful framework to predict and understand when \n\nan emerging technology will replace the current technology. The point where it is predicted \n\nthat a new technology will overcome the existing one is called the inflection point of existing \n\ntechnology. \n\nAccording to Rogers (1995), in its diffusion of innovations theory, there are five categories \n\nof adopters along the S-curve adoption model. There are the innovators, early adopters, \n\nearly majority, late majority and laggards. By using this model, the company will be able to \n\nfigure out who are the potential adopters and when they will adopt it. By knowing that, the \n\ncompany will be able to anticipate market opportunities before the competitors, and focus its \n\nsales effort according to the adoption level.  \n\n6. The Innovation Adoption from Organizations \n\nBesides the decision of what technology should be adopted, aligned with the company \n\nstrategy, there is also another important issue that consists on deciding if the company wants \n\nto be a technological follower or a leader. According to Porter (1985) technological \n\nleadership consists of being the first to introduce a technological change and, with that, being \n\nable to support the company\u2019s strategy. \n\nFor Porter (1985) the choice of being the technological follower or technological leader is \n\nbased on three issues: what are the advantages of being the first to adopt a technological \n\nchange; what are the disavantages of moving first to a new technology than competitors; and \n\nat what extent the leader is able to sustain the technological change over its competitors. \n\n6.1 New Technology adoption drivers \n\nChandy and Tellis (2000) showed in their study how influential companies resist to new \n\ntechnologies and how they can loose their leadership quickly after the introduction of a new \n\ntechnology in the market that replaces the previously established techonology. There are \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n26 \n \n\nseveral reasons for this behaviour like the organizational inertia, too much dependence on \n\nfixed assets, incorrect assement of the market or pure conservatism.  \n\nAs a result of this behavior, incumbent companies tend to react late and invest small \n\namounts of money in new techonogies. Usually companies only tend to react to a certain \n\nproblem or need and there are five main factors that might explain the adoption of new \n\ntechonologies and innovation by the firms: \n\nNew Competitors: the entry of new entrepreneurs could facilitate the adoption of new \n\ntechnologies because they are less exposed to the interests and routines inherent of an \n\nindustry. Consequently the possibility of a radical change in an industry grows. Christensen \n\n(1997). Also companies from a different sector can develop a new technology that might give \n\nthem a competitive edge in a different sector.  \n\nExternal Crisis: According to Hoffman (1999), a crisis can be seen as an \u201coccasional \n\nevent\u201d that interrupts a period of stability and requires the adoption of practices different from \n\nthe ones that are being performed. Crisis are important mechanisms for the adoption of new \n\ntechnologies: they create and accelerate the necessity of companies and sectors to develop \n\nand adapt their activities to new technologies, they offer the opportunity of reflection of the \n\ncurrent practices and uncertainty makes the companies take more risks in the adoption of \n\nnew technologies.  \n\nNew Technology Performance: the third factor that influences the adoption of a new \n\ntechnology is the performance and the learning curve of that technology when compared to \n\nthe existing one. Usually new technologies are more expensive and complex than the \n\nexisting ones, but it has a better chance to bring more benefits in the medium-long run \n\n(Christensen, 1997). \n\nChanges in the Market: It can occur through the emergence of new alternative \n\ntechnologies or as a result of the changing needs of consumers who can demand new \n\nfeatures in the product or service that they need. The first option is a push strategy, which \n\nconsists in pushing the new technology to the customers. The second one is a pull strategy, \n\nwhere the changes in the demand may lead to experimentations with new technologies, \n\nwhich over time can break down the existing ones. \n\nIndustry Competitiveness: the competition among the firms of the same sector is also a \n\nfactor that influences the adoption of new technologies. According to Porter (1985) \n\ntechnology influences the competitive advantage if it has a significant role in determining a \n\ncost position or differentiation. So the adoption of new technologies can give the chance of \n\nwinning a competitive advantage over the competitors. \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n27 \n \n\n6.2- Value Chain \n\nDespite all the factors that influence the adoption of new technologies it is essential that \n\nthe innovation adopted create value for the clients and for the company. Through the \n\nanalysis of the Value Chain is possible to see how the adoption of a certain technology can \n\ncreate that value, in comparison to the value that was provided before the new technology \n\nadoption.  \n\nThe value chain concept was introduced by Porter with the goal of analyzing what are the \n\nsources of competitive advantage of the company, by examining its different activities in how \n\nthey perform and interact in the different areas. \n\nAccording to Porter the value chain should be constructed at the company level and not at \n\nthe industry level. Although some companies within the same industry can have similar value \n\nchains, they have certain differences and those differences are what create sources of \n\ncompetitive advantage.  \n\nFor Porter it is through technological and physical activities, which represent value \n\nactivities, that a company creates value for their customers. The value obtained by the \n\ndifference of the total value and the total cost of the value activities performed represent s the \n\nmargin. Both margin and value activities are the total value represented in the value chain.  \n\nIn the value chain we have two types of value activities: the primary activities that involve \n\nthe creation of the product, its sale and the after sale support and the support activities that \n\nsupport the primary activities and each other by providing the different company functions \n\nlike technology, human resources or purchased inputs. They are subdivided in five \n\ncategories and four activities respectively.  \n\nRegarding the primary activities, they include inbound logistics, operations, outbound \n\nlogistics, marketing, sales and service. For Porter (1985), each of these categories has a \n\nhigher or lower role in the companies\u2019 competitive advantage according to the industry that \n\nthey belong to. On the other hand the support activities are subdivided in procurement, \n\ntechnology development, human resources management and firm infrastructure. \n\nAccording to Porter (1985) value activities have a key influence in the company\u2019s \n\ncompetitive advantage. The way that each activity is performed, aligned with the company \n\neconomics, has an impact on the cost of product or service provided and on whether the \n\ncompany has a high or low cost comparing to its competitors. The execution of each activity \n\nwill contribute to the creation of some differentiation when compared to other competitors. \n\nThis difference will determine the competitive advantage of the company.  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n28 \n \n\nThere are several products that do not go directly from a company to the consumer, so \n\nPorter says that a company value chain is part of a larger system, named The Value Chain \n\nSystem. This system relates the value chain of upstream and downstream suppliers. The \n\nupstream suppliers are the ones that create and deliver inputs to a certain company that \n\nuses them in its value chain. The downstream suppliers receive the product and deliver it to \n\nthe buyers and the activities performed by them will influence the company activities and the \n\nbuyer\u2019s chain. \n\n7. Factors that influence the adoption/rejection of innovative \n\ntechnologies \n\n7.1 New technology adoption Steps \n\nIn order to find out what are the factors that influence the adoption/rejection of innovative \n\ntechnologies, it is necessary to understand how an innovation spreads along to consumers. \n\nAccording to Rogers (1995) the innovation diffuses, first, through the selective \n\ncommunication channels and, over time, among the members of the society. For Rogers \n\n(1995) there are five sequential steps for the adoption of innovations: the first one is the \n\nacquisition of the necessary information about the innovation; then is the formulation of an \n\nopinion about it; the third is the decision about the adoption; the fourth implementation of it; \n\nand finally the review of the decision.  \n\nThe second step is the most critical, where according to the perception of the innovation \n\ncharacteristics, potential buyers develop an overall opinion about it. The capacity of \n\nunderstanding the different features of the innovation contributes to a higher probability of \n\nadoption. There are five features that represent a huge importance according to Rogers \n\n(1995): relative advantage, according to its performance and cost; compatibility in terms of \n\nvalues and norms; complexity in the difficulty of understanding and use; experimentation, \n\nregarding the degree where the innovation can be experimented; and the observation, where \n\nthe effects of the adoption are visible. \n\n7.2 Perceived Risk \n\nAlthough in the adoption of an innovation there is always the uncertainty element, and \n\nthere is also the risk that the innovation does not create the expected final benefit or even \n\ncreate social and economical losses for the consumer. According to Stone and Gr\u00f8nhaug \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n29 \n \n\n(1993) there are six interrelated perceived risks that contribute to customer resistance in the \n\nadoption of a new technology: \n\nFinancial Risk: it represents the probability of the customer losing money when he/she \n\nacquires the product or service. In fact most consumers are looking for a short payback \n\nperiod, when they decide to use more efficient technologies. \n\nPerformance Risk: represents the probability of something going wrong with the \n\nperformance of a certain product or service. The other thing that can happen is that \n\ncustomers have certain expectations and if the performance of that product/service does not \n\nfit, it can damage the company business. \n\nPhysical Risk: reflects the concerns of the customers regarding the safety of a certain \n\nproduct or service. \n\nPsychological Risk: represents the possibility of a product or service not to fit well in the \n\nlife style and personal image of the customers. Most of the consumers still have insufficient \n\ninformation about the use of new technologies, which influences its adoption.  \n\nSocial Risk: represents the risk that a purchase of certain product or service affects how \n\nthe society will look to the user of it. \n\nAll this five different risks related contribute to another risk that is the possibility of \n\nadoption of alternative products or services. In the case of the taxi industry there are other \n\nmeans of transportation like individual cars, Metro and buses that can substitute the service \n\nprovided by the taxi. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n30 \n \n\nIV. Teaching Note \n\n1. Case Summary \n\nRetalis is a cooperative enterprise that was created in 1977 with the major objective of \n\nbeing the leader in the taxi transportation industry. Its core competences were mostly related \n\nwith a radio service provided for the different cars in order to help them finding the clients, \n\nwith no need to search for them along the Lisbon streets. \n\nIn the first years of its existence the company was able to grow exponentially and in the \n\nnew millennium it reached 825 cars working with Retalis radio service. However, in the last \n\nyears the company had been threatened, not only by the growth of one its competitors, \n\nAutocoope, but also by the resigning or quitting of some members that were unsatisfied with \n\nthe company service. Those members were resigning because they perceived that the \n\nmoney spent to have Retalis radio service was not useful. In 2008 there were only 790 cars \n\nin Retalis and the company was providing over the radio on average 8 out of 26 services per \n\ncar per day. For some members the money spent on the monthly fee did not have the \n\nexpected return. \n\nIn 2008 a new direction was elected. Jose Dionisio was the president and he had to make \n\na lot of changes in the company. Despite the leadership in the taxi industry, Retalis was \n\nfacing many challenges: some members were leaving the company; the costs had been \n\nincreasing in the last years; the information systems were outdated; there was unsatisfied \n\ndemand; and the main competitor was growing, threatening Retalis leadership. \n\nThe president knew that something had to be done to change the course of the events. So \n\nhe came up with the measure of reformulating the company strategy and the information \n\nsystems. In the past measures were taken to beneficiate the associates by creating \n\nagreements to reduce their costs or increase their revenues (like the BP agreement to \n\nreduce the diesel costs or the advertisement campaigns to increase revenues). It was \n\nnecessary to change that; Eng. Jose Dionisio thought that the measures taken should \n\nbeneficiate first the end consumer, and consequently they would also please the associates.  \n\nSo to please the customer, Eng. Jose Dionisio realized that the information systems \n\nshould be updated. The radio system that had been used in the last 30 years was completely \n\nineffective and there was unsatisfied demand. He did a research and found a GSM/GPRS \n\nthird generation system that could be extremely useful for the company, in a way that it \n\nwould reduce the time spent in the allocation of each service. Instead of the average 5 \n\nminutes in the old system, this new one would allow to allocate a service in 20 seconds.  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n31 \n \n\nDespite the obvious advantages of the system, the application of it in Retalis was not \n\ngoing to be easy. The investment to adopt the new service would cost 1400 Euros by car. \n\nAnd with the economic crisis in Portugal the associates did not have that money available to \n\nspend in the new system. But the factor that most concerned Jose Dionisio was the mentality \n\nof the associates. There was a work culture deeply rooted where some of the members had \n\nmore than thirty years of affiliation. Most of the members looked at these new technologies \n\nwith distrust and were afraid of change.  \n\nAs the company was a cooperative, the members that did not want to adopt the new \n\nsystem could leave the company. This would have a huge negative impact in the company, \n\nbecause all its revenues were directly linked to the number of working cars.   \n\nSo the president was facing a huge dilemma, whether the adoption of the new information \n\nsystem would be the right measure to make, taking in consideration that \u201cTechnology is not \n\nan end, only a mean to an end. And that end is to please the people that are involved with \n\nthe company, from the customer to the taxi drivers and owners and the operators. It is \n\nnecessary to show them that the change is positive to everyone\u201d Eng. Jose Dionisio. \n\n2. Learning objectives \n\nThe Case Study was done to be used in business strategy classes and the Teaching Note \n\nwas designed in a way to allow the instructor to choose the concepts and frameworks that \n\nshould be used in class. But, as it has an innovative component, it might also be interesting \n\nto analyze the case in a class related to innovation and the impact of new technologies in \n\norganizations.  \n\nThe approach used in the Teaching Note aims to ensure that, after reading and analyzing \n\nindividually and in class the case study, students are able to know how to: \n\n1- Use common strategic frameworks and concepts to understand and evaluate the \n\nperformance of the company in the industry, namely: \n\na) Applying the SWOT and PESTEL analysis to understand how the company is \n\nperforming and the external factors that influence that performance. \n\nb) Comparing industry attractiveness through the Porter Five Forces analysis. \n\nc) Understanding through the Value Chain how the company is adding value to both \n\nassociates and end-consumers. \n\n2- Apply Innovation frameworks and concepts to provide a deeper analysis of the adoption \n\nof a certain technology, namely: \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n32 \n \n\na) Understanding what reasons led the company to change, despite its leadership in the \n\nmarket. \n\nb) Applying the S-curve framework to compare the performance of the used technology \n\nand the one proposed to implement. \n\nc) Analyzing the risks inherent in the adoption of a new technology. \n\nd) Using the Value Chain framework to understand how the new technology can creates \n\nvalue to the associates and end-consumers. \n\n3- Evaluate the dilemma of the company and give different options to adopt for the future. \n\n3. Suggested assignment questions \n\nThe following questions are guidelines for the students\u2019 preparation of the class. The \n\nquestions are structured for a strategy course, before the adoption of the new technology. \n\n1) Analyze the internal and external environment of Retalis. \n\n2) How attractive is the industry where Retalis is?  \n\n3) What are the problems and the dilemmas that the company is facing? What are the \n\nreasons that lead the company to this scenario? \n\n4) \u201cTechnology is not an end, only a means to an end. And that end is to please the \n\npeople that are involved with the company, from the customer to the taxi drivers and owners \n\nand the operators. It is necessary to show them that the change is positive to everyone\u201d, \n\nsummarized Jose Dionisio \n\nAnalyze how the adoption of the new technology could create value to the players that are \n\ninvolved with the company. \n\n5) You have been appointed as Vice-President in Jose Dionisio team. And the first \n\nmeeting is about to begin in a few moments. The president wants to know from you the \n\nanalysis of the adoption of the new technology, as well as your recommendations for the \n\nfuture of the company. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n33 \n \n\n4. Class Plan \n\nThe following questions are suggested topics to address in class, in order to ensure a \n\nthorough analysis of the case study. In order for students to understand the strengths and \n\nweaknesses of their answers in the different assignments as well as learn where they can \n\nuse the frameworks learned, it is important that the class topics are taught in an interactive \n\nway. The frameworks and time allotment for each assignment are suggested in the \n\nBlackboard plan.   \n\nAssignment Question 1 \n\na) Describe the overall performance of the company before 2008 and its strategic goals.  \n\nb) Summarize the macro-environmental factors that have been influencing the company\u2019s \n\nperformance. \n\nAssignment Question 2 \n\nc) Analyze Retalis competition in the transport industry.  \n\nd) Compare Retalis primary activities with the other taxi cooperative companies in Lisbon. \n\nAssignment Question 3 \n\ne) Highlight the main issues and problems that were concerning Jose Dionisio and his \n\nteam.  \n\nf) Analyze the reasons that lead the company to propose the adoption of the new \n\ntechnology. \n\nAssignment Question 4 \n\ng) Compare the value that would be added by the adoption of the new technology with the \n\nvalue that is currently added. \n\nh) Analyze the risks that the company is subject to if it decides for the adoption of the new \n\ntechnology. \n\nAssignment Question 5 \n\ni) Summarize the analysis done and decide whether the adoption of the new technology is \n\nthe right measure to take.  \n\nj) Understand how the adoption of the new technology can create a source of competitive \n\nadvantage and assess its sustainability. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n34 \n \n\n5. Analysis \n\na) Describe the overall performance of the company before 2008 and its strategic \n\ngoals.  \n\nIn order to describe the overall performance of a company and its strategic goals, it is \n\nimportant to describe the company\u2019s mission, vision and values. In the Retalis case, the \n\ncompany works based on the follow vision, mission and values: \n\n \n\nThe vision of Retalis shows how the company wants to be seen by the society. It \n\ninfluences the employees\u2019 performance and motivation to work with the company. The \n\nmission is seen as a long term guide that hardly changes and influences the company goals. \n\nThe values are also the way that the company wants to be seen and demand its employees \n\nto work on that way. \n\nHaving in mind the company vision, mission and values, the company formulates its own \n\nstrategic goals: \n\n-To provide more radio services for the associates; \n\n-To provide stable and continue extra revenues for the associates besides the taxi \n\nservice; \n\n-To develop the service quality of the company; \n\n-To create loyal individual and business clients; \n\n-To improve the image of the taxi drivers among the society; \n\nFinally, it is possible to analyze, based on the information supplied on the case, how the \n\ncompany was performing in the market before 2008.

Powerful brand name in the industry. When people think in taxi, automatically think in \n\nRadio Taxis; \n\n2. Market leader in the taxi industry; \n\n3. Ability to create extra revenues for the associates and consequently for the company; \n\n4. Agreement with BP to reduce the costs; \n\n5. Well-defined company structure; \n\n6.

The company weaknesses have a bigger impact on the results than the \n\nstrengths, and due to the threats of the market, some of the strengths can disappear in the \n\nnear future if Retalis continues to opperate in the current way. In terms of identified \n\nopportunities, they can influenciate positively the business but it is not certain that they will \n\ngenerate revenues for Retalis. \n\nSo as a conclusion, the overall performance of the company is not satisfactory, since \n\nthere are a lot of features that are weakening and threatening the company operations and \n\nimprovements to be made. \n\nb) Summarize the macro-environmental factors that have been influencing the \n\ncompany performance. \n\nIn order to understand the key macro-environmental factors that are influencing the \n\nactivity of Retalis, it is important to consider the PESTEL analysis, with the aim of identifying \n\nthe main external factors that influence the company\u2019s performance in the market and the \n\ndemand behavior within the industry.  All the factors that are influencing the company activity \n\nas well as the demand behavior are graphically summarized in Table 1: \n\nTable 1 \n\n \n\nPESTEL Analysis \n\n \n\nDescription \n\n \n\nImpact on Demand \n\n \n\nImpact on Retalis \n\n \n\nPolitical/Legal \n\n \n\n \n\n-Municipal Council controls the prices to \n\nbe charged by taxis to the consumer; \n\n- Controls the number of taxis that can \n\ncirculate in Lisbon; \n\n-Municipal Council is giving incentives to \n\nthe use of collective public \n\ntransportation; \n\n-Continuous improvements in Carris and \n\nMetro in terms of quality and coverage; \n\n-Lisbon taxis only can take services \n\ninside the city; \n\n-Increasing taxes  \n\n-W ith prices set by the \n\ngovernment customers \n\nknow what price to expect; \n\n-Consumers have more \n\noptions to move from a \n\nplace to another; \n\n- Are more willing to use \n\ncheaper means of \n\ntransportation; \n\n- The government \n\nincentives make \n\nconsumers prefer cheaper \n\nmeans of transportation; \n\n-The increased taxes \n\nmake some affiliates \n\nleave the company to \n\nreduce costs; \n\n-Limited number of cars \n\nand covered area; \n\n \n\nEconomical \n\n \n\n \n\n-Current world\u2019s economic crisis is \n\nreducing the buying power of \n\nconsumers; \n\n-Taxi is seen as an expensive mean of \n\ntransportation; \n\n-Banking national crisis affects the loans \n\nto make improvements in the company; \n\n-Increasing oil costs; \n\n-Demand  currently \n\ndecreasing, mostly due to \n\nthe economic crisis; \n\n- Increase of oil prices \n\nmakes potential customers \n\nprefer public \n\ntransportation, instead of \n\ntheir own car; \n\n- W ith less clients the \n\ncompany revenues are \n\ndecreasing; \n\n-Increase of oil prices \n\nmakes the costs to grow \n\nand reduce margins; \n\n \n\nSocial \n\n \n\n \n\n-Customers more quality demanding; \n\n-Customers more price-sensitive due to \n\nthe economic crisis; \n\n- Taxi drivers are seen as tricky people; \n\n-Very competitive market; \n\n-Growth of Lisbon population \n\n- All the four initial factors \n\nhave a negative impact on \n\nthe demand for the taxi \n\nservice; \n\n- The population growth \n\nincrease the demand; \n\n- Less consumers make \n\nthe revenues of \n\nassociates decrease; \n\n- One associate bad act \n\ncan be generalized to the \n\nentire company; \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n37 \n \n\n \n\nTechnological \n\n \n\n \n\n-Very low innovation technology; \n\n- Outdated technology systems; \n\n- More technological \n\nadvanced society, \n\ndemands better quality in \n\nthe service; \n\n- Unsatisfied demand; \n\n-Associates unsatisfied \n\nwith daily number of radio \n\nservices; \n\n- Too much time spent in \n\nthe allocation of each \n\nservice; \n\n \n\nEnvironmental \n\n \n\n \n\n-Incentives and legislation against the \n\nCO2 emissions; \n\n-Energy consumption of the cars is \n\nextremely high; \n\n-Ecological society that \n\ntend to use less polluting \n\nvehicles; \n\n-High prices due to \n\nenvironmental rules; \n\n-Increased costs due the \n\nenergy consumption; \n\n-High costs due to \n\nenvironmental rules; \n\n \n\nc) Analyze Retalis competition in the transportation industry.  \n\nThe first step needed to analyze the competition within an industry is to analyze its life-\n\ncycle. The taxi industry was already a mature market, where the different companies battled \n\nto allocate more services to their associates, in order to keep them in the company and \n\nattract new ones. According to the information provided in the case there are three main \n\ncompanies in the taxi industry that are in different phases of their lives, due to different \n\nstrategies of their managers. But this framework can only be used to analyze the industry, so \n\nin the Graph 1 it can be seen the position of the industry in the respective life-cycle. \n\nGraph 1 \n\n \n\nAfter analyzing the industry life-cycle, it is important to understand the structural \n\nattractiveness of the industry. The most solid framework to analyze this attractiveness is the \n\nPorter Five Forces.   \n\nIn the Table 2 there is an evaluation of the taxi industry attractiveness through the \n\napplication of the Porter Five Forces framework. \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n38 \n \n\nTable 2 \n\n Taxi Industry \n\n \n\nThreat of New Entry \n\nLow \n\nWith the current legislation, where the municipal council \n\ncontrols the number of taxis in Lisbon there is no threat to \n\npotential entrants in the industry. There are already 3 big \n\ncompanies operating in the business and there is not a big \n\nopportunity to new entrants. So the threat is low. \n\n \n\n \n\nBargaining Power of Buyers \n\nHigh \n\nThe current economic crisis makes the consumer \n\nrationalize expenses and cut in the consumption of \n\nproducts and services that are not indispensable. Also \n\nthere are a lot of competition in the industry and a lot of \n\ntaxis to choose from. Finally the consumer has several \n\nchoices in terms of means of transportation. So the \n\nbargaining power of buyers is very high. \n\n \n\n \n\nBargaining Power of Suppliers \n\n \n\n \n\nModerate/Low \n\nIn terms of suppliers in the taxi industry they mostly \n\nconsist in the gas stations and the drivers of the taxis that \n\nare the ones responsible to supply the service for Retalis \n\ncustomers. The gas stations have a big interest to have \n\nsuch a big client that consumes their product daily and the \n\ntaxi drivers also have a big interest to provide the service \n\nin order to win more money. So the power of suppliers is \n\nmoderate/low \n\n \n\n \n\nThreat of Substitutes \n\n \n\n \n\nHigh \n\nThere are several means of transportation that a person \n\ncan choose from to move from a place to another in \n\nLisbon. From his/her personal car, to metro, bus, tram and \n\ntrain. There are a lot of options to choose from and with \n\nthe current crisis consumers tend to choose from cheaper \n\nmeans of transportation. So the threat of substitutes is \n\nvery high. \n\n \n\nCompetition Rivalry \n\n \n\nHigh \n\nThe very high threat of substitutes and the very high \n\nbargaining power of buyers aligned with the huge amount \n\nof taxis in Lisbon make the rivalry among competition to \n\nbe very high.  \n\nThrough the five forces analysis it is possible to conclude that the taxi industry \n\nattractiveness is low, mostly because of the high existing rivalry, the diversity of existing \n\nsubsititutes and also because it is already a mature market with a small potential to grow.  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n39 \n \n\nd) Compare Retalis primary activities with the other taxi cooperative companies in \n\nLisbon. \n\nIn order to characterize the company\u2019s business activity, it is useful to use Porter\u00b4s Value \n\nChain. With the aim of evaluating how the company\u2019s activities are performing, the \n\ncompany\u2019s typical business is going to be compared with the main competitor, namely \n\nAutocoope.  \n\nGraph 2 \n\n \n\nThe primary activities performed by Retalis and Autocoope are very similar. Since they \n\nare companies that only provide services to their taxi drivers, they are very limited in terms of \n\nvalue chain. In terms of inbound logistics their inputs are particularly the same, their suppliers \n\nconsist in telecommunication companies that only supply the equipment for the central and \n\nfor the cars to receive the services over the radio. Each company works with a different \n\noperator but there are not huge differences among them.  \n\n In terms of operations the two main companies work similarly: they receive the client call \n\nand announce the information over the radio similarly in order for the associates to apply for \n\nthe service. The allocation process for the services works in the same way for both \n\ncompanies. Also at the operational level, these companies are responsible to search for \n\nagreements with individual clients and companies to create some new sources of revenues \n\nand loyal clients for the associates. In this chapter each company have different agreements \n\nthat differentiate from each other, and Retalis has more diverse and specialized contracts, \n\nlike the BP agreement, the advertisement in the cars and the Radio Taxis social found.  \n\nIn what concerns the Outbound logistics, it consists in the communication with the client \n\nwhere the car number that is going to his/her address is specified and the predicted time that \n\nis going to take. This step works in the same way for both companies. \n\nRegarding marketing, the two companies have been working differently in the last years. \n\nOn one hand, Retalis has been doing nothing in terms of marketing, trusting only in the word \n\nof mouth over the taxi drivers to attract new associates. On the other hand, Autocoope \n\ndropped the affiliation fee and was reaching for the taxi drivers that did not belong to any \n\nInbound \nLogistics \n\nOperations \nOutbound \nLogistics \n\nMarketing  Service \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n40 \n \n\ncooperative association. This difference made Autocoope grew a lot and be very close to \n\nRetalis numbers. \n\nFinally the end-service consists in the transportation of a client from one place to another \n\nand it is performed by taxi drivers. Each service is different, there are services that are well \n\nperformed but there are others that dissatisfied the customer. In the last case the main \n\ncomplains are the antipathy of the driver and the client\u2019s feeling that the driver took a longer \n\nway than necessary in order to charge more money. If the client feels the need to complain, \n\nhe/she goes to the police and the driver can be suspended by the cooperative for a certain \n\nperiod of time. These acts can damage the company image, because one bad act from an \n\nassociate can be generalized to the entire company, making it loose customers. On the other \n\nhand both companies provide credit services to the customers. In table 3 the core differences \n\nbetween the two companies and its effects on margin are analyzed.  \n\nTable 3 \n\n Core Differences Effect on Margin \n\nInbound Logistics -There are not huge differences. The \n\ncompanies work with different \n\ntelecommunication suppliers but the \n\nprocesses are very similar.  \n\n- As they work similarly, there is \n\nnot a big impact on the \n\ncompanies\u2019 margins. \n\nOperations -Business processes to allocate \n\nservices to the associates are the \n\nsame. What differentiates the \n\ncompanies is the extra revenues \n\nprocesses and specific agreements. \n\n- With more diverse agreements \n\nand sources of revenues \n\nprovided, Retalis is able to \n\nattract new associates and \n\nmaintain the existing ones. Has \n\na positive impact on the margin. \n\nOutbound Logistics -There are not big differences \n\nbetween companies \n\n-No Impact  \n\n \n\nMarketing \n\n-Retalis has been doing almost \n\nnothing regarding marketing. On the \n\nother hand Autocoope dropped \n\naffiliation fee and was promoting \n\namong the taxi drivers that did not \n\nbelong to any cooperative to attract \n\nthem to the company. \n\n- The marketing by Autocoope \n\nattracted several associates to \n\nthe company and some Retalis \n\nassociates that were \n\nunsatisfied. Has a negative \n\nimpact on Retalis margin. \n\n \n\nService \n\n-A taxi service is similar for both \n\ncompanies and is performed by the \n\ndifferent associates. \n\n- The credit service provided by both \n\ncompanies are also similar. \n\n-As there are a large number of \n\nassociates, a bad act from one \n\nof them can create a \n\ngeneralization to the entire \n\ncompany. Affects the company \n\nmargin negatively.  \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n41 \n \n\ne) Highlight the main issues and problems that were concerning Jose Dionisio and his \n\nteam.  \n\nTo understand the key issues and problems that were affecting the company it is \n\nimportant to analyze the threats that the company was facing at that time and also analyze \n\nthe performance of the used technology systems through an S-curve analysis.  \n\nBased on the case there were several threats that were affecting the company business, \n\nnamely: \n\nThreats \n\nIncrease of Autocoope market share \n\nIncrease of oil prices \n\nOutdated technology system \n\nAssociates leaving the company \n\nUnsatisfied demand \n\nEconomic crisis \n\n \n\nSome of these threats were directly linked to the company core competences and it was \n\nnecessary to do something to change it. On the other hand, the increase of oil prices, \n\nAutocoope growth and the economic crisis were factors outside the company that shou ld be \n\ntaken into consideration in the adoption of a new strategy for Retalis.  \n\nAlso it is important to highlight that the internal problems facing the company were related  \n\nwith each other. So, by upgrading the technology system to a modern and effective one it \n\nwould be possible to satisfy better the demand and consequently the associates would not \n\nleave the company. They would have more radio services,  and Retalis would differentiate \n\nfrom the main competitors.  \n\nFrom the analysis of the S-curve (graph 3), it would be \n\npossible to conclude that the technology used had reached \n\nits maximum performance, that it was outdated and that the \n\ncompany should move to a new one in order to satisfy \n\nbetter the customers and stop the associates resigning.  \n\n \n\n                                                                                                              Graph 3: S-curve \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n42 \n \n\nf) Analyze the reasons that lead the company to propose the adoption of the new \n\ntechnology. \n\nThere are several drivers that can influence the adoption of a new technology by a certain \n\ncompany, namely: the appearance of new competitors, an external crisis, the appearance of \n\na new technology, changes in the market and in the industry competitiveness. \n\nIn the case of Retalis it was a combination of these main drivers that made the company \n\npresident Eng. Jose Dionisio think of the possible adoption of a new system that would \n\nreplace the one that had been used in the last 30 years. In table 4 it can be seen how the \n\nmain drivers influence the company on the adoption of the new technology.  \n\nTable 4 \n\nDrivers Influence \n\nNew Competitors Low \n\nExternal Crisis Moderate \n\nNew technology Performance High \n\nChanges in the Market Moderate \n\nIndustry Competitiveness High \n\n \n\nIn the last years there were no new taxi entrances in the market and the public \n\ntransportation offered by the government was already well covered. There were several \n\nbarriers imposed by the government to the entrance of new taxis in Lisbon (the 3550 taxis \n\nwere more than enough for the demand required), consequently the possible entrance of \n\nnew competitors were not a big threat that was concerning Jose Dionisio. So the influence, of \n\npossible entry in the industry, was low for the adoption of the new technology.  \n\nAn economic crisis is always seen as an event that interrupts a period of stability and \n\nrequires the adoption of practices different from the ones being performed. In 2008 there was \n\na serious economic crisis in Europe and Portugal was not an exception. Several companies \n\nwere closing and unemployment was really high. With the economic crisis, people spend less \n\nmoney where they can and the impact in Retalis could be high, because the taxi \n\ntransportation is not an indispensable good. With the current technology there was \n\nunsatisfied demand that was switching to the competitors or to other means of transportation. \n\nThe company could not take the risk to lose more clients. A change in the way that the \n\ncompany operated was necessary. So the influence of the economic crisis was moderate.  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n43 \n \n\nThe Radio System in Retalis was supported by a completely obsolete more than 30 years \n\nold technology. It took a very long time from the call made by the client for the car to arrive in \n\nthe required address. And the process of allocating the service was susceptible to several \n\nflaws, untruths and mistakes. There was a historical of lies made by the taxi drivers saying \n\nthat they were in a certain place and they were not, just to receive the service. Also the \n\nregister of the address could be done wrongly and consequently the service would not be \n\ndelivered. With the GSM/GPRS system all this threats would be reduced, because the \n\nsystem would allow to deliver a service in 20 seconds, the localization of the nearest car \n\nwould be automatic and the address of a client would be already on the list. The new \n\ntechnology performance could beneficiate a lot the company\u2019s activity so the influence in the \n\ndecision was high.  \n\nThe market change topic is related to the economic crisis and the new technology \n\nperformance because it is a consequence of them. The market is always changing and \n\ncurrently with new technologies and the economic crisis the clients are getting more \n\ndemanding in terms of quality. They require a good service in order to see their money spent \n\nin a service that they liked. So the influence of the market change was moderate. \n\nFinally the industry competitiveness had a high influence in the management proposal of \n\na new technology. Autocoope had been growing a lot in the last years and it was threatening \n\nthe leadership of Retalis in the taxi industry. Also the Portuguese government had made \n\nsome improvements in the collective public transportation (Carris and Metro), like the quality \n\nimprovement of buses and metros or the covering of more Lisbon surrounding areas. Thus, \n\npublic transportation was stealing clients on comfort, functionality and quickness ground.  \n\nSo the different drivers had an influence in the new technology adoption proposal, but \n\nsome of them had a bigger impact than others, due to the external environment that was \n\ninfluencing the company business. \n\ng) Compare the value that would be added by the adoption of the new technology with \n\nthe value that is currently added. \n\nIn order to analyze the impact of the new technology adoption in Retalis, it is important to \n\ncompare its value added with the value that was previously added by the used technology. \n\nThe adoption of the GRSM/GSM system would have an impact on both primary and support \n\nRetalis activity. In terms of primary activities the impact will mostly be seen in operations and \n\nin service. Regarding the support activities the main impact would be seen in the technology \n\ndevelopment and human resources management. As the old system was already discussed \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n44 \n \n\nand analyzed in question d), it is important to analyze how the GSM/GPRS system would \n\ncreate value for the associates and end-users of the service.  \n\nThe GSM/GPRS would have a huge impact in Retalis operations. It would enable the \n\ncompany to allocate more than one service at a time in a better, more efficient and effective \n\nway. Instead of receiving the clients address and communicate it over the radio for the \n\nassociates to apply in a long confuse and sometimes problematic way, the system \n\nautomatically identifies the nearest car. The driver has up to twenty seconds to apply for the \n\nservice. If he does not press any button, the service passes on to the second nearest car and \n\nso on. The system adoption would create value for Retalis, its associates and clients in \n\ndifferent ways but all of them inter-related. That was the main goal of Jose Dionisio, in a way \n\nthat the technology adoption was not an end by itself, only a mean to an end and that end \n\nwas to please the people that were involved with Retalis. In table 5 the value added to the \n\ndifferent players involved with the company can be seen. \n\nTable 5 \n\n Value Added \n\n \n\nClients \n\n-Spending less time over the phone waiting to talk to an operator; \n\n-Reduction on the time and money spent waiting to know which \n\ncar was allocated to him/her; \n\n-As the service is quicker there is no need to go to the streets \n\nlooking for a taxi; \n\n \n\n \n\nAssociates \n\n-More than one service at a time means that there will be more \n\nservices available over the radio; \n\n-More radio services allow associates to increase revenues and \n\nreduce costs (there is a lower need to drive along the city looking \n\nfor clients, which means that there would be a lower oil \n\nconsumption and a lower threat to accidents); \n\n-The automatic allocation of services deletes the historical of lies \n\nand makes the allocation fairer; \n\n-Clients would prefer Retalis due to its effectiveness and efficient \n\nservice which would also increase the demand for the associates; \n\n \n\n \n\nRetalis \n\n-Opportunity to create a differentiation and consequently a source \n\nof competitive advantage; \n\n-The quicker allocation of service makes the clients happy and \n\nmight turn them loyal to Retalis; \n\n-More services over the radio makes the associates happier and \n\nconsequently they will not fell the need to drop Retalis; \n\n-By creating a more efficient and effective service, end-users \n\nwould prefer Retalis and this might attract new associates to the \n\ncompany. \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n45 \n \n\n \n\nThe new technology adoption implies a change on the company\u2019s strategy. Since its \n\nfoundation, Retalis was mainly focused on the creation of extra revenues or agreements that \n\nbenefit directly the associate. It was not an inappropriate strategy, in a way that the \n\nassociates are the ones that bring revenues for Retalis. Although in the last years, this \n\nstrategy was not enough because it did not bring any benefit for the end-consumer of the \n\nservice provided by Retalis. With the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system there was a change \n\nin the company\u2019s strategy. It was not only adding value for the associate but also for the end-\n\nconsumer of the service. \n\nh) Analyze the risks that the company is subject to if it decides for the adoption of the \n\nnew technology. \n\nIn the adoption of a new technology there is always the uncertainty element, where \n\ninnovation does not create the expected final benefit or even create social and economical \n\nlosses for the customer. There are five main types of interrelated risks that contribute to \n\ncustomer resistance in the adoption of a new technology: financial, performance, physical, \n\nsocial and psychological risk. These different risks together contribute to the risk of adoption \n\nof alternative services that affect directly the company business.  \n\nIn the Retalis case the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system is subjected to some of these \n\nrisks in a different way as it can be seen in table 6. \n\nTable 6 \n\nType of risk Risk Level \n\nFinancial Risk High \n\nPerformance Risk High \n\nPhysical Risk Low \n\nSocial Risk Low \n\nPsychological Risk Moderate/High \n\nAdoption of Alternative Services Risk Moderate/High \n\n \n\nIn the adoption of the new system each Retalis associate needs to spend 1400 Euros to \n\nbuy and install the equipment in his taxi. In times of crisis it is an high investment, especially \n\nfor those that have more than one taxi working in the firm. First there is the risk that some  of \n\nthem decide to leave the company because they do not find it worth to spend that amount in \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n46 \n \n\nthe new system. Also there is the risk that, after the adoption of the new system, the \n\nassociates demand a shot payback period for their investment. But it is known that, after the \n\nadoption of a new technology, there is a learning process before it works at the maximum \n\nperformance. So if the associates become unsatisfied with the new technology, they would \n\nstart to leave the company, making the level of financial risk high.  \n\nIn what the performance risk is concerned, it is related to the financial risk. The \n\nGPRS/GSM looks better than the currently used system but if the expectations of the \n\nassociates are at high level, they will demand results since the beginning of implementation. \n\nAnd that would not be possible because there is the introduction phase where they need to \n\nlearn out to work with it, before the maximum performance of the system is reached. These \n\nhigh expectations can make some associates unsatisfied with the system and start to leave \n\nthe company. So there is a high performance risk.  \n\nIn what the physical and social risks are concerned, they are low to Retalis. The new \n\nsystem is perfectly safe and for those that purchase the system it only means a different way \n\nto operate in order to get the services over the radio system. And if the system is adopted, \n\nsociety might even look at taxi drivers differently, because the system will show some \n\nexpertise.  \n\nFinally the psychological risk represents a moderate/high threat for Retalis. Most of the \n\ncompany associates have more than thirty years of affiliation, a low education level and an \n\nadvanced age. They look at this new technology system with distrust, do not identify \n\nthemselves with the system and do not see it as a solution for the company\u2019s problems. By \n\nadopting the system some of them can leave the company because they do not find the \n\nsystem worth it.  \n\ni) Summarize the analysis done and decide whether the adoption of the new \n\ntechnology is the right measure to take.  \n\nIn the previous class topics both the internal and the external environmental situation were \n\nanalyzed, through several frameworks and Retalis proposal to adopt the GSM/GPRS system \n\nwas discussed.  \n\nRegarding the internal analysis, Retalis is the biggest cooperative enterprise and is \n\ncharacterized for having a radio service that has the ultimate goal to add value to its \n\nassociates, by providing more services to them with no need to drive along the city searching \n\nfor clients and to create new sources of revenues. Retalis had also the goal to satisfy the end \n\nconsumer, through a practical, quick and effective service. But the company\u2019s performance \n\nwas not going well, it had been losing associates and clients were unsatisfied because the \n\nradio service was not effective and was completely outdated. There was also an historical of \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n47 \n \n\nlies between the associates when they were applying for a service that was causing troubles \n\nand worrying Retalis.  \n\nIn the external analysis it can be highlighted that the Lisbon taxi industry is a very \n\ncompetitive market and it has a big control from the municipal council in terms of prices and \n\nlimited geographical area of operation. There were 3500 cars (including Retalis, Autocoope, \n\nTeletaxis and individual owners) and the demand for them is not very high. Moreover, Retalis \n\nmain competitor in the taxi industry, Autocoope, had been increasing its market share, due to \n\na reformulation in the company and an effective marketing campaign to attract new \n\nassociates, which was threatening Retalis leadership. Also, due to the economic crisis and \n\nimprovements made in means of transportation like Carris and Metro, potential customers \n\nprefer to use cheaper means of transportation that allow them to save money. Finally, the \n\nincrease in oil prices was affecting the entire industry, because it was an indispensable input \n\nand consequently the costs of the activity were increasing drastically.  \n\nAll internal problems aligned with external threats made Retalis management propose the \n\nadoption of the GSM/GPRS system. It was a modern and effective system that would allow \n\nthe company to distribute more than one service at a time and eliminate the historical of lies \n\nthat was creating problems. The system would automatically identify the nearest car, so \n\nthere was no need to discuss it. Also in the clients perspective the system would allow to \n\nsave time and costs, because the time spent on the phone asking for a service would \n\ndecrease from an average 5 minutes to 20 seconds.  \n\nThe S-Curve provides a useful framework to compare \n\nthe performance of the currently used system and the \n\nGSM/GPRS system. In the graph 4 can be seen how the \n\nnew technology evolves in terms of performance when \n\ncompared with the previously system. In the beginning \n\nthere is all the learning process which can be difficult. \n\nAfter that the knowledge is acquired and the \n\nperformance can grow a lot, creating a source of \n\ncompetitive advantage for Retalis.                                               Graph 4: S-curves \n\nDespite the performance benefits in terms of allocation of services, Retalis should be \n\naware of the threats that the adoption of this system would create. For that it is important to \n\ncompare the main opportunities and threats that the company would have if it decides to \n\nadopt the GSM/GPRS system: \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n48 \n \n\nOpportunities: \n\n- More effective system might attract new associates for the company and keep current \n\nmembers. \n\n- Creation a better image of Retalis and its drivers in the market. \n\n- Increasingly satisfied clients for the same price can create a source of competitive \n\nadvantage. \n\n- By being the first one to implement the system, Retalis can then outsource to other \n\ncities. \n\nThreats: \n\n- High investment needed to implement the service aligned with the economic crisis can \n\nmake some associates leave the company. \n\n- Traditional working culture can be an obstacle for the new system implementation. \n\n- Advanced age and low education level of associates makes them look to new \n\ntechnologies with distrust and they might also leave the company. \n\n- Competitors can easily have access to a similar system in the market and copy it. \n\n \n\nThis should be the basis of the class discussion for the adoption or not adoption of the \n\nGSM/GPRS system. Even though some opinions may differ, Retalis should adopt the new \n\nsystem not only because it improves the company\u2019s performance but also because it creates \n\na source of competitive advantage. Also if Retalis does not move ahead, other competitor \n\nmight adopt the system and create its own competitive advantage and gain the related \n\nbenefits. Even if some associates leave the company and consequently the company\u2019s \n\nrevenues go down, in the future and after the learning process, Retalis will rise again in \n\nterms of associates and become the most attractive company in the industry to work with for \n\nseveral years.  \n\nRegarding the recommendations for the company, it should always try to update it \n\nsystems in order not to repeat the past mistakes and should also do two different marketing \n\ncampaigns: one to attract new associates by showing the advantages of the GSM/GPRS \n\nsystem and another to the end-consumer to show the quickness and advantages of using \n\nRetalis taxis instead of the competitors and substitutes. Finally, after the GSM/GPRS is \n\ncompletely operational and working closer to the maximum performance, Retalis should try \n\nto outsource it to other Portuguese cities. This would not only be beneficial for Retalis in the \n\ncreation of a new source of revenue but also to the other cities companies, because although \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n49 \n \n\nsimilar systems are easily accessible in the market, Retalis knowledge of the system would \n\naccelerate the learning process and the results  would appear faster. \n\nj) Understand how the adoption of the new technology can create a source of \n\ncompetitive advantage and assess its sustainability. \n\nThere are three main types of strategies that can lead to a company\u2019s competitive \n\nadvantage: cost, differentiation and focus strategy. With the adoption of the GSM/GPRS \n\nsystem Retalis is investing in a new technology that will differentiate and improve the quality \n\nand create value for the service provided, when compared to the competition.  \n\nBy being the first taxi cooperative to adopt and update the technology systems, Retalis \n\nwould create an impact in the market that would create a recognition and attract to the \n\ncompany more associates and clients. Because the associates would get more services over \n\nthe radio and consequently their revenues would increase and costs would decrease. \n\nRegarding the clients they would have a faster service with lower flaws for the same price. \n\nSo, being the first company to adopt the new technology would create value to the company, \n\nits associates and clients, creating a source of competitive advantage. \n\nHowever, it is necessary to analyse if the competitive advantage would be sustainable in \n\nthe future. So it is important to analyze the rarity, immitability and subsitutability of the service \n\nprovided by the new technology use: \n\n-Rarity: Retalis would be the first company to update the technology systems to a more \n\nefficient and effective one, which would create an impact on the way that the market would \n\nlook to the company. Also they would acquire knowledge in the operations management that \n\nthe other companies do not have.  But it is important to notice that technology is always \n\nevolving, and if Retalis wants to keep leading the industry, it is necessary to currently update \n\nthe systems in order to better satisfy the demand. \n\n-Inimitability: The GSM/GPRS system is available for the other companies in the market; \n\nsince it was not a product developed by Retalis but from a company specialized in this type \n\nof communications. Retalis competitors can, easily, get access to a similar system in the \n\nmarket if they have the necessary budget to invest. But the competitors did not have the \n\nsame number of associates of Retalis, and it was going to be harder for them to collect the \n\nnecessary investment. Also there is a transition period from a system to another, and when \n\nthe competitors are updating its systems (if they decide to), Retalis would already be working \n\nwith it and creating an impact on the market that would be harder to imitate.  \n\n-Substitutability: it is an issue that will continue to threat Retalis. The GSM/GPRS \n\nsystem might improve the service quality and create a competitive advantage when \n\ncompared to the other taxi cooperatives. But on the other hand the current Portuguese \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n50 \n \n\neconomic crisis is leading customers to use cheaper means of transportation, which is \n\nthreatening and stealing customers from the taxi industry. So regarding the substitutability, \n\nRetalis service will continue to be threatened by other means of transportation and, in spite \n\nof the better service provided, there are a lot of players in the taxi industry that might replace \n\nRetalis service. \n\nSo as a conclusion, the new technology adoption can create a competitive advantage for \n\nRetalis via the service differentiation and it might be sustainable in the next two years if it is \n\nwell released in the market. But in order to keep the leading position in the industry, Retalis \n\nshould be continuously updating the technology system in the future in order not to repeat \n\nthe mistakes of the past (keeping the same system for thirty years) and lose their competitive \n\nadvantage. \n\nFinally, as it was already recommended in the Class Plan question i), it is important to \n\nhighlight that although similar systems with similar functionalities could easily be accessible \n\nin the market, Retalis should try to outsource the system to other cities. And this action would \n\nbe advantageous both for Retalis and other cities companies. On one hand Retalis would be \n\ncreating a new source of revenue and consequently increasing its profits, on the other hand \n\nthe other cities companies would see results of the adoption faster, because Retalis \n\nknowledge would be transmitted to them which would accelerate the learning process. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n51 \n \n\n6.

Conclusion \n\nRetalis was created with the ultimate goal of helping, through a radio service, its \n\nassociates in the search of clients with no need to drive along the city looking for them. At the \n\nsame time the client would also beneficiate from the service because it would be easier and \n\nfaster to get a taxi. As the years went by, the company became the leader in the industry and \n\nthe technology system used to allocate the services had remained the same for the last thirty \n\nyears which originated a deeply rooted working culture among the associates. For several \n\nyears Retalis did not have a strong competition, but after the shift of Autocoope strategy, the \n\nscenario had changed and in the beginning of 2008 the market share of the two companies \n\nwas not that different due to an effective campaign made by Autocoope to attract new \n\nassociates.  \n\nWith technology evolution, consumers demand better quality in the products and services \n\nthat they use. The Retalis radio system was the same since the foundation. It had several \n\nflaws and was completely outdated, in a way that it was only possible to allocate one service \n\nat a time and it took on average five minutes in the allocation. This originated unsatisfied \n\ndemand due to the time spent on the phone waiting to know which car was coming to get \n\nhis/her address and unsatisfied associates that started to resign from Retalis because the \n\namount of radio services performed by car were a very small percentage of the total \n\nservices.  \n\nThe company\u2019s decision to propose the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system was then \n\ncaused by the problems related with the dissatisfaction of both associates and customers. \n\nThis system also represented a change in the company\u2019s strategy, because it was not only \n\ntaking measures to beneficiate the associate but also adding value to the clients. Despite the \n\nnotorious performance improvement brought by the new system there were several risks that \n\nthe company would face, mostly financial, physiological (characteristics of associates with \n\nadvanced age and low education) and also regarding the performance expectations. The \n\ncharacteristics of the associates, mostly the advanced age and low education level were a \n\nbarrier for the new system adoption. In fact, they could leave the company if they disagree \n\nwith they did not agree with the measure and with that weakness even more Retalis \n\nleadership.  \n\nHowever, something must change in the company and the technology improvement was \n\nextremely necessary for the future performance. By being the first one to adopt the new \n\nsystem, Retalis would create a source of competitive advantage that could bring advantages \n\nand results in the medium future and it could also make possible to expand the business to \n\nother Portuguese cities, via outsourcing.  \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n54 \n \n\nSo it can be concluded that Retalis should adopt the GSM/GPRS system in order to \n\nimprove its position in the market and also gain a competitive advantage over its competitors. \n\nBut it would only be possible, if the associates cooperate with each other and a ligned the \n\nmeasure with an effective marketing campaign to attract new associates and increase \n\nawareness in the market. Also in the future, the company should try to outsource the system \n\nto other cities in order to get a new source of revenue. \n\n8. What happened \n\nThe situation discussed and analyzed during the dissertation took place in 2008. So it may \n\nbe useful for the instructor to have information on what was the Retalis decision and its main \n\nconsequences and decide whether to share it with students.  \n\nRetalis decided to adopt the GSM/GPRS system in December of 2008. But it was not an \n\nunanimous decision, in a way that some associates were against it, claiming that the new \n\nsystem adoption was very expensive and that it was only a way to get money from the \n\nassociates with no practical results. In fact, a \u201crebellion\u201d newspaper against the president \n\nEng. Jose Dionisio was created, which showed the intensity of the opposition. By the end of \n\nthe year, 130 associates left the company, arguing that the new system adoption was a bad \n\ndecision. This represented a setback for the company, because one of its goals was to \n\nincrease market share, and with the resigning of these members, it was losing even more \n\nshare. \n\nThe launch of the system took place in June 2009, after some months of studies, \n\npreparation of the entire fleet and training for the taxi drivers. The results were not immediate \n\nand some of the associates started to complain about it. During this period there were \n\nseveral meetings where it was explained that the results could only be seen in the \n\nmedium/long term. \n\nFinally, after some months of working with the GSM/GRPS system, it was possible to see \n\nsome results: the percentage of the new system services over the total services increased (6 \n\nout of 20 services); and the diesel costs did not decrease due to the increase of the oil \n\nprices, but the consumption did reduce. \n\nIn the company\u2019s perspective, the results were good but not as good as expected. In its \n\nperspective, the service provided was better than the competition and better than the \n\nprevious one, so they increased the entrance fee from 1000 Euros to 5000 Euros, which \n\nmeant that some of those who were interested to enter into the company gave up, because \n\nthey could not afford it. Also the company did not make an effort on the marketing campaign \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n55 \n \n\nto the clients, and currently the major part of the population does not know about the Retalis \n\nchange and improvement. \n\nWhen the new president Pedro Lopes joined Retalis, the entrance fee was reduced to the \n\n1000 Euros and with that measure, the company was able to attract new associates and \n\nreached 700 cars in the end of 2011.  \n\nIn 2011 Retalis also launched the Ebooking system where individual and business clients \n\nthat use frequently Retalis service could create a personal account and have in their \n\ncomputers a program that would allow them, with just one click, call for a taxi with no need to \n\nuse the phone. Finally in 2012 Retalis is planning to introduce the Internet service, where \n\nevery client, and not the ones that frequently use the company\u2019s services, can go Retalis \n\nwebsite and ask for a taxi or book it to a certain hour. \n\nThe competition felt the need to improve its information systems too, and Autocoope is \n\ncurrently planning to adopt a system similar to the one being used by Retalis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n56 \n \n\nV. Conclusion \n\nDuring these six months of working in this dissertation there were several aspects that \n\ncontributed to the acquisition of knowledge. It was very interesting to understand how a taxi \n\ncompany like Retalis works and all the processes that are behind a taxi service. Most people \n\nthat call for a taxi and after a couple of minutes have a car at their door, do not have the \n\nslightest idea about all the backup processes that made it possible. Also, in this time of crisis \n\nit was exciting to understand what Retalis has been doing to fight against it, aware that the \n\ntaxi service is more expensive than other means of transportation. Instead of cutting costs or \n\nother savings, the company invested in the quality of service to attract new associates and \n\ncreate loyal clients. Although this could be nonsense, something had to be done to fight \n\nagainst the decline of the company in the industry. \n\nOne of the main challenges during the dissertation was the search for information \n\nregarding the company and the industry. There is not that much information available in the \n\nInternet and in addition the information provided by the company was contradictory in what \n\nsome numbers were concerned, especially information from the past and from the \n\ncompetition. But at the same time it was very demanding and interesting to analyze the \n\ncontradictions and find the most reliable information.  \n\nFinally it was interesting to apply frameworks and concepts learned during strategy \n\nclasses to an industry where they had never been applied or, at least, where there is no \n\nliterature about it. \n\nRegarding the challenges for the company, it is important to highlight that the adoption of \n\nthe GSM/GPRS system was important for the company but it did not solve all the problems. \n\nOther challenges continued to exist. The economic crisis and the continued increase of oil \n\nprices are two problems that kept to affect the industry and that make it less profitable and \n\nattractive. The total services per day are decreasing and the costs of the activity are higher \n\nthan ever, decreasing the profits of the different taxis and consequently the profits of Retalis \n\nand other similar companies.  \n\nIf I had more time, it would have been interesting to analyze how the industry can bypass \n\nthese problems. It could be important for the industry to develop a marketing campaign, \n\nshowing that taxi transportation, does not have to be expensive, if people adopt the taxi \n\ntogether, which means, sharing the taxi with friends or neighbors to go to work for example. \n\nAlso, in the company\u2019s perspective it could be attractive to expand or outsource the new \n\nsystem to other cities, in order to increase brand awareness and revenues. \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n57 \n \n\nFinally, in a further development of my work it would be interesting to compare the activity \n\nof taxis that have a radio system and others that do not, in terms of services and kilometers \n\nper day. Also, the comparison of the activity of different cities could be explored, in order to \n\nhave a general overview of what is happening nationally.  \n\nAs a general conclusion, it was very interesting to write this dissertation, where I learned \n\nand understood how the taxi industry works and applied the concepts and frameworks \n\nacquired in class to the analysis of the industry and the decision of adopting the GSM/GPRS \n\nsystem by Retalis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRetalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry \n\n58 \n \n\nVI.
