Migmatites (garnet-cordierite diatexi-\nte) dominate the metamorphic rocks and host lenses and layers of felsic \ngarnet granulite. The conditions of temperature and pressure of meta-\nmorphism were calculated using conventional thermobarometry and \nthe software THERMOCALC. Values around 850 \u00b0C and 7 kbar were \nobtained with THERMOCALC. The calculations for the garnet-cordie-\nrite diatexite were made considering aH2O equal to 1, but the best results \nof calculations for the granulites are obtained with aH2O values of 0.3. \nPressure values obtained with GAPES resulted in consistent values with \nTHERMOCALC, but the pair garnet-orthopyroxene always produces \nlow values for temperature and high ones for pressure. The results are \nconsistent with the presence of the pair garnet and cordierite in diatexite \nand orthopyroxene in felsic granulite. From the tectonic point of view, \nthe setting in which metamorphism of these rocks occurred requires high \nheat flow with a thermal anomaly in mid continental crust, as indicated \nby values of 7 kbar. Recent studies have favored the closure of a back-arc \nbasin for this tectonic setting, but it does not solve the problem that the \ntime span between metamorphic peak and the end of granite intrusions, \ninvolving large bodies of charnockite, is more than 80 million years. \n\nRESUMO: No sul da Bahia ocorrem migmatitos e granulitos do Com-\nplexo Jequitinhonha, por\u00e7\u00e3o norte do Or\u00f3geno Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed.

However, several factors linked to the genesis \nof granulites and migmatites contribute negatively to make this \ntask simple and easy. After the metamorphic peak temperature \nis achieved, often greater than 800\u00b0C, granulites and migma-\ntites cool down slowly in the middle to lower portions of the \ncontinental crust, a situation that leads to their re-equilibration. \nFurthermore, the presence of a melt phase is common in gran-\nulite facies conditions and can enhance the rate of diffusion or \neven destroy anhydrous metamorphic peak mineralogy during \ncooling (Moraes et\u00a0al. 2002; White &amp; Powell 2002, 2010). \nFor the effective calculation of P-T conditions, either correc-\ntions on mineral compositions or thermodynamic modeling \nmust be done. The loss of simplicity makes the task complex, \nchallenging, attractive and, particularly, an interesting subject.\n\nTo illustrate some of the problems related to the P-T cal-\nculation in migmatites and granulites, rocks of the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed \nOrogen, in southern Bahia, will be used as an example. \nOnce the results are obtained, an evaluation of their geo-\nlogical, metamorphic and tectonic meaning is undertaken.\n\nThermobarometry applied \nto granulites and migmatites: \nproblems and restrictions\n\nIn continental crust granulite facies metamorphism, in \naddition to recrystallization of the protolith, conditions may \ninvolve significant amount of partial melting. The percentage \nof the partial melting depends on the rock fertility, with practi-\ncally zero for anhydrous basalt, increasing to amphibolite, gran-\nite, greywacke and pelite. The process involves biotite or horn-\nblende dehydration melting reactions, at temperatures above \n800\u00b0C, producing H2O unsaturated silicate liquid and a solid \nresidue, rich in peritectic phases (Fyfe 1973; Thompson 1982; \nHartel &amp; Pattison 1996; Vielzeuf &amp; Schmidt 2001; White &amp; \nPowell 2002; Johnson et\u00a0al. 2008). Among the most common \nperitectic minerals are garnet, ortho- and clinopyroxene, min-\nerals used in thermobarometry of granulite facies rocks. Slow \ncooling and the coexistence of the granulite residue with sili-\ncate melt are responsible for most of the problems related to \nthe application of thermobarometric methods to migmatites \n\nand granulites. The direct calculation of the metamorphic peak \nconditions can be hampered when it is followed by a slow cool-\ning stage, which facilitates continuous exchange of Fe, Mg, \nCa and even Al, between garnet and pyroxenes until low tem-\nperatures, modifying significantly their compositions (Frost &amp; \nChacko 1988; Harley 1989, 2008; Fitzsimons &amp; Harley 1994; \nPattison &amp; B\u00e9gin 1994; Pattison et\u00a0al. 2003). As these minerals \nparticipate in a significant part of thermometers and barome-\nters of granulite facies, it is necessary to evaluate the extent of \nchemical changes to proceed with the methods of correction \nof the mineral compositions. The changes are more extensive \nwhen pyroxene grains are in direct contact with garnet, or when \ngarnet is surrounded by biotite, generating the worst results in \nthermobarometry (Spear &amp; Florence 1992). Major adjustments \nin mineral compositions might be avoided when garnet and \npyroxene grains are separated by quartz or plagioclase, which \ninhibit re-equilibration of Fe and Mg (Fitzsimons &amp; Harley \n1994; Pattison &amp; B\u00e9gin 1994).\n\nFor the recovery of the metamorphic peak mineral com-\npositions, there are some developed methods (Fitzsimons &amp; \nHarley 1994; Pattison &amp; B\u00e9gin 1994; Moraes &amp; Fuck 2000; \nPattison et al 2003), and most are based on experiments car-\nried out to calibrate both barometers (Harley &amp; Green 1982; \nHarley 1984b) and a thermometer (Harley 1984a), involving \nthe garnet-orthopyroxene pair. The calibration of the Harley \nand Green (1982) barometer is independent of the Fe/Mg ratio \nof minerals, but it is not the case with the one produced by \nHarley (1984b). Therefore, it is possible to calculate pressure \nwith the aid of both calibrations, and by changing the Fe/Mg \nratio of orthopyroxene and garnet, the two calibrations may \nprovide the same pressure. Starting from the adjusted compo-\nsitions, the temperature of the metamorphic peak is calculated \nby using the orthopyroxene-garnet thermometer (Fitzsimons &amp; \nHarley 1994; Pattison &amp; B\u00e9gin 1994). A variant of this method \nalso takes into account the modal proportion of minerals to \nlimit and control the corrections made (Pattison et\u00a0al. 2003).\n\nThe coexistence of a silicate melt and granulite residue may be \nresponsible for changes in post-peak metamorphic rock mineral \nassemblage, involving consumption and production of mineral \nphases. Also, the presence of melt facilitates the diffusion of ele-\nments between minerals, increasing the efficacy in the chemical \nre-equilibrium during cooling, which may promote profound \nchanges in their composition, thwarting successful thermobaro-\nmetric calculations. If the melt is not segregated from granulite \nresidue before cooling, the minerals of metamorphic peak may \n\nThe\u00a0model of tectonic switching is suggested here as it can explain the \nmaintenance of high temperatures for a more extended interval of time.\nKEYWORDS: Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen; Granulite; Migmatite; \nThermobarometry.\n\n(tectonic switching) \u00e9 sugerido para explicar a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o de tempera-\nturas elevadas durante intervalo de tempo t\u00e3o prolongado.\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE: Granulito; Migmatito; Or\u00f3geno Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed; \nTermobarometria.\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 45(4): 517-539, December 2015\n518\n\nThermobarometry in migmatites and granulites\n\n\n\nreact with it and suffer total or partial consumption that can \neven erase the evidence of granulite facies in the rock (Powell &amp; \nDownes 1990; Moraes et\u00a0al. 2002; White &amp; Powell 2002, 2010). \nFull preservation of the granulite facies mineral assemblage is \nachieved by the removal of most produced melt (Moraes et\u00a0al. \n2002; White &amp; Powell 2002). Additional problems may hap-\npen due to crystallization of entrapped melt within the residue, \nwhich generates new minerals not present during the metamor-\nphic peak, for example, plagioclase, biotite and ilmenite, which \nif used in thermobarometric calculations will generate values of \ntemperature and pressure without any geological significance.\n\nModern softwares use internally consistent thermodynamic \ndata sets for thermobarometric calculations and other petrological \ntasks, such as TWQEEU (Berman 1988) and THERMOCALC \n(Holland &amp; Powell 1998, 2011). Here,\u00a0the thermobarometric \ncalculations are based on a group of linearly independent reac-\ntions that use all thermodynamic information of metamorphic \npeak mineral assemblages; consequently, the results produced \nare robust (Powell &amp; Holland 1994). If it is possible to have \nthe bulk composition of the protolith before granulite facies \nmetamorphism and partial melting took place, for example, by \nanalyzing an amphibolite facies regional equivalent, it is possi-\nble to calculate pseudosections and, through them, to make a \nmodel of metamorphism and partial melting processes (White \n&amp; Powell 2002; Powell et\u00a0al. 2005; Baldwin et\u00a0al. 2005). The \nbeauty of pseudosections is also its doom, because its calcula-\ntion is based on the rock bulk composition, but in the case of \nmigmatites and granulites, which involved partial melting and \nsegregation of its melt phase, original rock bulk composition \nis lost, making it difficult or impossible to use the method for \na precise thermobarometry.\n\nGeological Setting of the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen\nThe Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Belt was defined as the fold belt formed during \n\nthe Brasiliano Orogeny, which limits the south and southeast \nborders of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton in Minas Gerais and Bahia \n(Almeida 1977). It is part of the Mantiqueira Province (Almeida \net\u00a0al. 1977, 1981), or the northern portion of the Mantiqueira \nOrogenic System (Heilbron et\u00a0al. 2004), or even the external \nportion of the Brazilian side of the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed-West Congo Orogen \n(Trompette 1994; Pedrosa-Soares &amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos \n2000; Pedrosa-Soares et\u00a0al. 2001, 2007, Fig. 1). The last con-\ncept is adopted here for further discussions.\n\nAs the geological knowledge evolved, correlations between \nBrazilian and African counterparts were done, especially between \nAra\u00e7ua\u00ed and West Congo fold belts and S\u00e3o Francisco and Congo \ncratons (e.g. Brito-Neves &amp; Cordani 1991, Trompette 1994). \nIt\u00a0was then recognized that rocks in the once adjacent continents \nrepresent different portions of a whole orogen, the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed-West-\nCongo Orogen (Pedrosa-Soares &amp; Noce 1998; Pedrosa-Soares &amp; \nWiedemann-Leonardos 2000; Pedrosa-Soares\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02001,\u00a02007), \n\nwhich is referred here, for simplicity, as the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen. For \ndetails and definitions of the orogen portions, equally its stratig-\nraphy, tectonic units and magmatic suites, the reader must access \nrecent in-depth reviews (Alkmin et\u00a0al. 2007; Noce et\u00a0al. 2007; \nPedrosa-Soares et\u00a0al. 2007, 2008; Pedrosa-Soares &amp; Alkmin \n2011; Gradim et\u00a0al., 2014).\n\nThe orogen was developed from the end of Neoproterozoic \nuntil Cambrian times (Fig. 1). The continental rift stage of\u00a0the \nprecursor basin is represented by, at least, six events\u00a0of rifting \nand anorogenic magmatism. The youngest events are recorded \nby rocks of the basal portion of the Maca\u00fabas Group, mafic \ndikes of the Pedro Lessa Suite and anorogenic intraplate gran-\nites of the Salto da Divisa Suite, all of these rocks being older \nthan 870 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et\u00a0al. 2007; Pedrosa-Soares &amp; \nAlkmin 2011). The passive margin rocks are represented by \nmid to upper formations of the Maca\u00fabas Group, including \nmafic-ultramafic rocks, pelites and cherts, part of an ophio-\nlite complex that represents the oceanic portion of this basin \n(Pedrosa-Soares et\u00a0al. 1992, 1998, 2001, 2008, Aracema et\u00a0al. \n2000). Zircon grains of plagiogranite, associated with the mafic \noceanic rocks, yielded 660 \u00b1\u00a029\u00a0Ma, age considered as the time \noceanic crust was formed (Queiroga et\u00a0al. 2007). The pelites that \nderived migmatites of the Jequitinhonha Complex (Almeida \n&amp; Litwinski 1984) may as well be part of this passive margin \n(Pedrosa-Soares &amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000, Sampaio \net\u00a0al. 2004, Heilbron et\u00a0al. 2004, Pedrosa- Soares et\u00a0al. 2008).\n\nExtensive granite magmatism is recognized, ranging from \narc-related, representing a pre-collisional stage (ca. 630 \u2013 \n580\u00a0Ma), to sin-collisional (ca. 580 \u2013 560 Ma), up to post-col-\nlisional (ca. 530 \u2013 490 Ma). Structural relationships, as well as \npetrographic types, geochemistry signatures and isotopic ages \nare used to define this evolution and separate the bodies in five \nsuites (e.g. Pedrosa-Soares &amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000, \nPedrosa-Soares et\u00a0al. 2001, 2008, Silva et\u00a0al. 2005). The G1 \nsuite defines the pre-collisional stage and comprises deformed \ncalc-alkaline tonalite and granodiorite bodies with ages that \nspan from 630 to 585 Ma. S-type granites, mostly deformed \nand bearing cordierite and garnet are denominated as G2 and \nG3 suites; they define the sin-collisional stage and present ages \nbetween 585 and 535 Ma. The post-collision stage is marked \nby topographic highs, as the sugar-loafs bodies of G4 and G5 \nsuites, with ages that span from 520 to 490 Ma (Siga Jr. 1986; \nPedrosa-Soares &amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos, 2000; Pedrosa-\nSoares et\u00a0al. 2001). These granite bodies were emplaced mainly \ninto migmatites of the Jequitinhonha Complex and rocks of \nthe Maca\u00fabas Group and are represented, respectively, by two \nmica S-type granite and charnockite bodies, the last ones with \nmarked mantle-derived signature (Pedrosa-Soares &amp; Wiedemann-\nLeonardos 2000; Pedrosa-Soares et\u00a0al. 2007).\n\nTwo different units of the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen are constituted \nof migmatites derived from pelites, the Nova Ven\u00e9cia Complex, \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 45(4): 517-539, December 2015\n519\n\nRenato Moraes et al.\n\n\n\nwhich represents rocks deposited and metamorphosed in the \nback-arc basin (Gradim et\u00a0al. 2014), and the Jequitinhonha \nComplex (Almeida &amp; Litwinski 1984; Sampaio et\u00a0al. 2004), \nwhose protoliths were deposited in distal passive margin \n(Pedrosa-Soares et\u00a0al. 2007; Gon\u00e7alves-Dias et\u00a0al. 2011). The \nfirst geochronological data for these rocks was a Rb-Sr reference \nisochron using samples from both units. The results obtained \nindicate that the metamorphic event affecting these units \noccurred at 550 \u00b1 80 Ma (Cordani 1973). Later on, an inter-\nval for the age of metamorphism between 660 and 570\u00a0Ma, \nbased on Rb-Sr isochrons, was determined for rocks of the \nJequitinhonha Complex, with cooling ages between 540 and \n480 Ma (Siga Jr. 1986). Initial Sr87/Sr86 ratios indicate crustal \nsources of Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic ages (Siga Jr. \n1986) for the Jequitinhonha Complex. Dating of detrital zir-\ncon grains extracted from the Nova Ven\u00e9cia Complex have \nyielded ages spreading between 630 and 2100 (Noce et\u00a0al. \n2004). The\u00a0newer acquired data set of detrital zircon from rocks \nof the Jequitinhonha Complex resulted in ages between 960 \nand 2540 Ma, with the youngest grains dated at 898 \u00b1 8\u00a0Ma, \nconsidered to be the maximum age of deposition of this unit, \nwhat makes the unit chrono-correlated to the upper portion of \nthe Maca\u00fabas Group (Gon\u00e7alves-Dias et\u00a0al. 2011).\n\nP-T data of metamorphism and partial melting of migma-\ntites of the Jequitinhonha Complex are scarce. Temperature is \ncalculated between 715 and 790\u00b0C by using garnet-cordierite \n\nand garnet-biotite pairs (Uhlein et\u00a0al. 1998). Crystallinity \ndegree of graphite from graphite deposits hosted by migmatites \nand related rocks in northeast Minas Gerais indicates tem-\nperatures between 660 and 705\u00b0C, whereas P-T calculation \nusing THERMOCALC yielded values of 790 \u00b1 40\u00b0C and \n5.0 \u00b1 0.5 kbar for metamorphic peak conditions; TWEEQU \nyielded 890 \u00b1 50\u00b0C and 6.7 \u00b1 0,6 kbar (Bel\u00e9m, 2006).\n\nLocation of the study area\nThe investigated rocks are located in the south of Bahia, \n\nin the region of Teixeira de Freitas, Itanh\u00e9m, Itamaraju and \nJucuru\u00e7u (Fig. 2), and are part of the Jequitinhonha Complex, \nin accordance to the geological map of the area (Sampaio \net\u00a0al. 2004). Only outcrops where migmatites and granu-\nlites crop out were sampled.\n\nFIELD DESCRIPTION AND \nPETROGRAPHY OF GRANULITES \n\nAND MIGMATITES\n\nIn the investigated region, diatexite, felsic and mafic \ngranulites are the main rock types, and were intruded by \ncharnockite and S-type cordierite-garnet granite bodies \n(Sampaio et\u00a0al. 2004).

Leucosome, melanosome and a mesocratic res-\nidue are recognized, formed of cordierite rich-domains with \nsubordinate garnet that alternate with quartz-feldspar domi-\nnated domains. Cordierite and garnet may reach 30 to 40% \nin volume of some neosome. Due to high degree of partial \nmelting and segregation of large volumes of melt, now rep-\nresented by leucosome, no portion of the garnet-cordierite \ndiatexite represents its original bulk-composition. The\u00a0struc-\ntures observed in the diatexite are stromatic (Fig. 3A), schlie-\nren (Fig. 3B) and nebulitic (Fig. 3C). The leucosome veins \nmay be either parallel to foliation, considered as formed in \nsitu and present biotite selvedges at their edges (Fig. 3A), or \ncross-cut the foliation, as in source leucosome, bearing gar-\nnet porphyroblasts (Figs. 3D and 3E) or cordierite clusters \n(Fig. 3F). In most of the outcrops the rock is a mesocratic \nresidue with homogeneous matrix, foliated or not, hosting \nup to 5 \u2013 7 cm garnet porphyroblasts, and up to 40% of \ncordierite dispersed in the matrix. Garnet and cordierite may \nbe associated with leucosome, which demonstrates a close \nrelationship between the generation of peritectic porphy-\nroblasts and biotite-related melt reactions (Figs.\u00a03D to 3F). \nLeucosome blind veins are common and they merge with \nportions of trapped melt in the rock (Fig.\u00a03D). Diatexite \nwith nebulitic structure is common and is formed in low \nstrain regions (Fig. 3G), where the volume of leucosome \novercomes the residue, which also presents schlieren and \nschollen with no preferential orientation. Locally, the coales-\ncence of leucosome veins can form smaller bodies of cord-\nierite-garnet granite (Fig. 3H).\n\nAll collected samples for thermobarometry are of the \nmesocratic residue with either none, or just small volumes \nof leucosome.\n\nIn situ and in source \nleucosome petrography\n\nObserved in the petrographic microscope, leucosome \nveins may be divided into two compositional types. The \nfirst is dominated by quartz and cordierite, with subordinate \namounts of feldspars, whereas garnet may be present or not; \nthe second type has granitic composition, with similar pro-\nportions of quartz, K-feldspar and plagioclase, with minor \ncordierite and garnet. In quartz- and cordierite-dominated \n\nleucosome, quartz forms large elongated grains, sometimes \nmore than 1 cm across; contacts are straight or jagged with \nother quartz grains and chess-board like sub-grains are present \n(Fig. 4A). The cordierite grains are elongated and rounded, \nwith rare subhedral plagioclase inclusions (Fig\u00a04B); they \nmay contain inclusions of sillimanite, as fibrolite or larger \nxenoblastic grains, rounded biotite, monazite and zircon \n(Figs.\u00a04C and 4D); edges commonly are replaced by a mix-\nture of white mica, chlorite and carbonate. Feldspars occur \nbecause lenses are parallel to the foliation and at the edges of \nleucosome veins; grains are elongated in granoblastic texture, \nrarely subhedral (Fig. 4C). Subhedral plagioclase grains occur \nin the matrix, but it is not uncommon to recognize recrys-\ntallized rims, indicating crystallization from the entrapped \nmelt, but with subsequent deformation (Fig. 4B). Garnet also \noccurs within the leucosome, forming grains with irregular \nedges and bearing rounded inclusions of quartz, biotite and \nrare plagioclase; these grains are interpreted as not totally \ndissolved during partial melting and enclosed by peritectic \ngarnet. Melanosome is dominated by cordierite, rich in sil-\nlimanite inclusions; it occurs in leucosome edges and may \nbe partially enveloped by coarse-grained biotite (Fig. 4D); \nin some domains garnet is added to the melanosome min-\neral assemblage and it is also partially replaced by biotite or \nbiotite-quartz-feldspar symplectite; biotite occurs as large \nlaths, at least 1 mm in size, close to garnet or cordierite, to \nvery fine-grained away from them.\n\nThe second type of leucosome veins is dominated by \nK-feldspar (50%), quartz (45%) and plagioclase (5%). \nK-feldspar is mesoperthite, idiomorphic to subidiomorphic, \nwith clear edges, without exsolutions. Plagioclase occurs in \nsmaller amounts, and in some thin sections, is present only \nas myrmekite. Quartz occurs as interstitial phase between \nfeldspar grains, indicating that it was the last phase to crys-\ntallize from the melt. It also occurs as rounded inclusions \nwithin feldspars. Cordierite and garnet may be present and \nhave the same textural features as described above.\n\nGranite veins petrography\nVeins of garnet granite and garnet-cordierite granite are \n\nabundant, crosscut the diatexite and can also form small, \nmetric, isolated bodies due to collected liquid from the \nleucosome network (Fig. 3H). An igneous serial texture \nis dominant, marked by the occurrence of phenocrysts of \nperthitic to mesoperthitic orthoclase, with rounded quartz \ninclusions; the largest grains have straight edges, though \njagged contacts are not uncommon. Plagioclase is intersti-\ntial, comprising 5 \u2013 8% modal proportion, subordinate to \nquartz and orthoclase; grains present optical zoning and \nrounded quartz inclusions. Cordierite and garnet aggregates \nor porphyroblasts are common within the granite veins. \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 45(4): 517-539, December 2015\n521\n\nRenato Moraes et al.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Locally, late deformation imprints a protomylonite \ntexture on some veins, generating strong orientation, wavy \nextinction, sub-grains, new grains, and deformation bands, \nin both quartz and feldspars.\n\nResidue petrography\nThe residue portion of the garnet-cordierite diatexite \n\nmakes up between 30 to 70% of its volume. It is a mesoc-\nratic rock with gneissic aspect. The residue is dominated by \n\ncordierite (20 to 45%), quartz (20 to 35%) and orthoclase \n(10 to 30%), with varied proportions of garnet (1 to 30%) \nand plagioclase (1 to 15%); biotite is mostly retrometamor-\nphic and in smaller amounts (&lt;8%). Monazite, zircon, apa-\ntite and Fe-Ti oxide are the most common accessory phases, \nalong with sillimanite and green spinel. The rock texture is \ngranoblastic but oriented, with medium- to coarse-grained \ngrain size, larger than 5 mm in average (Fig. 5A). Lenticular \nclusters of feldspar and cordierite, elongated and recrystallized \nquartz, as well as biotite define the foliation. The cordierite \ngrains may be clear, but it is common to have rounded or \nxenoblastic inclusions of sillimanite, biotite, and green spi-\nnel, with minor amounts of monazite and zircon (Fig. 5B). \n\n2 mm\n\n1 mm\n\n100 \u00b5m\n\n100 \u00b5m\n\nFigure 4.

Garnet \nand cordierite, within the leucosome, may have corroded and \nirregular edges; some rims are replaced by biotite, usually in \nsymplectites with quartz and feldspars; sometimes magne-\ntite and, very rarely, sillimanite is present (Fig. 5D). It\u00a0is not \nuncommon to observe an irregular cordierite corona around \ngarnet, both partially replaced by biotite-quartz-feldspar sym-\nplectite, which in turn is surrounded by thin graphic inter-\ngrowth of quartz and feldspar (Figs. 5E and 5F). This\u00a0texture \nrepresents consecutive reactions between entrapped melt and \nFe-Mg porphyroblasts and final crystallization of the melt \nphase. The residue is poor in plagioclase, which occurs as rare \nsubhedral (Fig. 5G) or interstitial grains, sometimes as films \nin optical continuity (Fig. 5H), which were formed due to \ncrystallization of entrapped melt.\n\nFelsic granulite \u2013 field \naspects and petrography\n\nThe felsic granulite is subordinated to the garnet-cord-\nierite diatexite. The contact relationship between them can-\nnot always be defined, but in some outcrops a transition is \nobserved between biotite-rich diatexite and felsic granulite, \nand the contact is parallel to the regional foliation (Fig. 6A). \nLeucosome veins are arranged parallel to the regional folia-\ntion (Fig. 6B), with blind endings and, locally, cross cutting \nfelsic granulite foliation. Inside leucosome, orthopyroxene \nand garnet porphyroblasts are commonly observed.\n\nFelsic granulite is composed of quartz, plagioclase, ortho-\nclase, orthopyroxene, garnet, biotite and ilmenite; apatite \nand zircon are the main accessory phases. The texture is gra-\nnoblastic and oriented due to the disposition of elongated \northopyroxene, feldspars and ilmenite grains. Quartz forms \nelongated aggregates of large grains, parallel to the foliation, \nin flaser texture. Among the feldspars, plagioclase stands out, \nand orthoclase is mesoperthitic. Orthopyroxene and garnet \noccur as porphyroblasts, 2 to 3 mm long (Fig. 7A), though \nthe latter may reach diameter larger than 1 cm. Garnet is \nxenoblastic, presents many quartz and plagioclase inclusions \nand the edges are partially replaced by biotite (Fig. 7B), \nwhich also occurs at orthopyroxene rims (Fig. 7A). Quartz \nand feldspars films mimicking the entrapped melt are rare, \nbut occur in triple junctions (Fig. 7C) or around subhedral \nbiotite and among plagioclase grains (Fig. 7D).\n\nMINERAL CHEMISTRY\n\nBased on petrography, five thin sections were selected \nfor analysis using an Electron Probe Microanalyzer, by \n\nCameca, model SX 100, with four spectrometers equipped \nwith two TAP crystals, one LIF and one PET. The analyzes \nwere performed with conditions of 15 kV, 15 nA and beam \nof 5? diameter at the Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, at \nthe D\u00e9partement des Sciences de la Terre, Universit\u00e9 Blaise \nPascal, Clermont-Ferrand, France. The following chemi-\ncal elements were analyzed for each of the listed minerals:\n\n ? garnet \u2013 Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mg and Ca;\n ? cordierite \u2013 Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mg, Na and K;\n ? feldspars \u2013 Si, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, Na and K;\n ? orthopyroxene \u2013 Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mg and Ca;\n ? biotite \u2013 Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na, K and F;\n ? spinel \u2013 Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Mg.\n\nPunctual analyses were performed on feldspar, biotite \nand cordierite, core and rim, in at least three grains in two \nor three different fields of the same thin section. In garnet \nand orthopyroxene, the composition profiles were built with \neight to twenty points across the porphyroblasts. The\u00a0min-\nerals of five samples were analyzed, three samples of gar-\nnet-cordierite diatexite residue (RF-01, RF-06, RF-24) and \nalso two of felsic granulite (RF-03 and RF-16). From\u00a0the \ngarnet-cordierite diatexite, cordierite, garnet, feldspar, bio-\ntite and spinel were analyzed; and from felsic granulite, \northopyroxene, garnet, feldspar and biotite were analyzed. \nRepresentative analyses of mineral chemical compositions \nare presented in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nGarnet\nGarnet chemistry is controlled by bulk rock composi-\n\ntion and, in each sample, specific features are recognized. \nIn\u00a0the garnet-cordierite diatexite, garnet composition is \ndominated by end-members almandine and pyrope, with \nvalues between 70 and 80% and between 15 and 30% \nrespectively, depending on the sample (Fig. 8). In the three \nsamples, the almandine molecule increases subtly from core \nto rim, while pyrope decreases. The amounts of calcium and \nmanganese are low, with concentrations between 2 and 3%, \nand grossular features flat profile and spessartine increases \nslightly toward the edges. The composition may be gener-\nally described as alm70pyr25grs3sps2.\n\nIn felsic granulite, garnet composition is also dominated \nby the almandine molecule, followed by pyrope, grossular \nand spessartine, presenting, however, differences in relation \nto garnet of garnet-cordierite diatexite. In the felsic granu-\nlite, garnet composition is richer in calcium than in diatex-\nite, reflected in the increased amount of grossular, around \n10%, and corroborated by the common presence of pla-\ngioclase. The compositional profiles are almost flat, with \nsmall variations derived from slight increase of iron and \ndecreasing magnesium towards the rims.

For samples of the garnet-cordierite \ndiatexite, it is considered that garnet, cordierite, sillimanite, \nbiotite, orthoclase, plagioclase and quartz are the paragen-\nesis of the metamorphic peak and that H2O was in excess \n(aH2O = 1).

There is not much difference in \nresults if pressure and temperature are calculated separately \nor together, in this last case using the average P-T method \n(Tab. 3). It is not possible to calculate pressure or tempera-\nture if sillimanite is excluded from the mineral paragenesis.\n\nFor the felsic granulite, unrealistic values of T higher \nthan 1000\u00b0C are calculated when the rock is considered sat-\nurated with water. Several calculations are made with dif-\nferent H2O activity values, and the calculations made with \naH2O = 0.3 yielded calculated temperature as 850\u00b0C, similar \nto the values calculated for the garnet-cordierite diatexite. \nThe aH2O values do not influence in pressure calculation and \nvalues around 6.7 kbar are calculated (Tab. 3).\n\nThe P-T calculations are also made with the average P-T \nmethod with THERMOCALC, pressure and temperature \nbeing calculated at the same time when it is possible to \nevaluate the correlations between those intensive variables. \nWhen the correlation factor is high, close to 1, it indicates \nthat there is a strong dependence of the results obtained for \npressure and temperature.\n\nFor the garnet-cordierite diatexite, the calculated results \nare independent of the employed method. Calculations of \n\npressure and temperature made separately or using the average \nP-T method produced similar values within uncertainties. \nHowever, the average P-T method yielded high correlation, \nlarger uncertainties, and this means that if the calculated \ntemperature is reliable, calculated pressure is reliable as well, \nbut the reverse is also true. From a statistical point of view, \nthe results are valid, reliable and interesting because if tem-\nperature and pressure are calculated separately the results are \nvery close to the ones produced by the average P-T method, \nand the high correlation indicates the good quality of the \nresults obtained in the investigated rocks (Tab. 3).\n\nFor the felsic granulite, the calculations with the aver-\nage P-T method are quite dependent on aH2O, but the best \nresults, from a statistical point of view, are obtained with \naH2O values of 0.3, because the smallest uncertainties are \ncalculated (Tab. 3). Furthermore, results are similar to the \nconditions in which temperature and pressure are calcu-\nlated separately and are also similar to those calculated for \nthe cordierite-garnet diatexite samples.\n\nThe thermobarometric calculation with the orthopyrox-\nene-garnet pair, using the calibrations of Harley and Green \n(1982) and Harley (1984a, b) produces consistently lower tem-\nperatures and much higher pressures than THERMOCALC. \n\nTable 3.

For RF-3 sam-\nple, one garnet and two orthopyroxene grains were used in \nP-T calculations, resulting in calculated temperatures of 785 \nand 776\u00b0C, with the same garnet core and each of ortho-\npyroxene cores analyses. The calculated pressure using the \nsame sets of analyses resulted in 16.7 and 15.0 kbar, and \n14.0, and 15.4 kbar, using the Harley (1984a) and Harley \nand Green (1982) calibrations (Tab. 4).\n\nThe results calculated with compositions of the garnet-or-\nthopyroxene pair are discrepant from the ones produced by \nTHERMOCALC and are also not consistent with those \nobserved in experimental investigations with parageneses \ncontaining cordierite, whose stability is not higher than 10-11 \nkbar (e.g. Hensen, 1971). The exaggerated pressure results \nof calculations are controlled by the low concentration of \nAl2O3 in orthopyroxene, since the calibrations are designed \nfor rocks in which orthopyroxene is aluminum-rich, with \nconcentrations greater than 6 to 8%.\n\nPressure calculation using the garnet-quartz-plagioclase-py-\nroxene barometer is made using three different calibrations \n(Newton &amp; Perkins 1982; Perkins &amp; Chipera 1985; Eckert \net\u00a0al. 1991). Thermodynamic and experimental calibrations \nare available for the barometer, involving orthopyroxene \n(GAPES) or clinopyroxene (GADS) in the following reactions:\n\ngrossular + 2 pyrope + 3 quartz = 3 anorthite + 3 ensta-\ntite (GAPES)\n\n2 grossular + pyrope + 3 quartz = 3 anorthite + 3 diop-\nside (GADS)\n\nThe Newton and Perkins (1982) calibration is thermo-\ndynamic and can be used with either ortho- or clinopyrox-\nene, both treated as ideal solid solutions. The non-ideality \nin garnet solid solution is attributed to grossular-pyrope \nbinary, considered symmetrical (regular model), with \n\nMargules parameter WCaMg of 3300 \u00b1 1.5 T (K) calo-\nries/mole. Plagioclase is treated as non-ideal asymmet-\nric solid solution (sub-regular model), with values for \nthe Margules parameters of WAn = 2095 cal and WAB = \n6746\u00a0cal. The\u00a0calculated pressure with GAPES is consid-\nered the most reliable and results in values about 2 kbar \nhigher than those calculated with GADS. Uncertainties \nof 1.5\u00a0kbar are estimated for GAPES and 1.6\u00a0kbar for \nGADS. The\u00a0authors suggest that an empirical adjustment \nof -0.6 kbar for GAPES and +1.6 for GADS should be \nmade. Perkins and Chipera (1985) presented another \nGAPES thermodynamic calibration, involving the reac-\ntions of Mg and Fe end-members. The first is a calibra-\ntion in the CMAS system (CaO, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2), \nusing measurements of the thermodynamic properties \nof the involved end-members. The second calibration is \nbased on experimental data available (Bohlen et\u00a0al. 1980, \n1983) for the CFMAS system (CaO, FeO, Al2O3, SiO2). \nThe plagioclase activity model developed by Newton and \nPerkins (1982) is used; orthopyroxene is considered as an \nideal solid solution; garnet solid solution is treated with \na quaternary model, proposed by Ganguly and Saxena \n(1984). The application of Mg end-member reaction is \nnot recommended for Fe-rich rocks (Fe/(Fe + Mg) > 0.5). \nThe uncertainty is estimated to be \u00b1 1 kbar. The pressure \ncalculated from the Mg end-member reaction produces \nhigher values than from the Fe end-member calibration \nand they are also higher than values produced by the \ncalibration of Newton and Perkins (1982). Eckert et\u00a0al. \n(1991) presented an experimental and thermodynamic cal-\nibration based on redetermination of enthalpy of GAPES \nand GADS reactions, using calorimetry to replace the \none used in the equation\u00a0of Newton and Perkins (1982). \nAlso, the activity models of\u00a0Newton and Perkins (1982) \nfor garnet and plagioclase are adopted, while pyroxene \nis treated as ideal solid solution. Uncertainties of \u00b1 1.55 \nkbar to GAPES and \u00b1 1.90 kbar to GADS were signed.\n\nThe application of GAPES barometer for felsic granulite \nsamples RF-3 and RF-16 results in values between 8 and \n9\u00a0kbar (Tab. 5). The calculated pressure values are 1 to 1.5\u00a0kbar \nhigher than the ones calculated with THERMOCALC, but \nwithin the stability field of cordierite observed in the associ-\nated garnet-cordierite diatexite, and are compatible within \nthe uncertainty range when the correction of -0.6 kbar is \napplied, within the uncertainty range.\n\nThe calculated P-T conditions, about 7 kbar and 850\u00a0\u00b0C, \nare within the granulite facies conditions, if a minimum tem-\nperature of 800\u00b0C is considered as the lower limit as sug-\ngested by Pattison et\u00a0al. (2003). Such conditions are com-\npatible with the stability fields of orthopyroxene, present in \nthe felsic granulite, cordierite, which is extremely abundant \n\nTable 4.

(2008, figure 1d of that \npaper), and given the calculated P-T conditions, the same \nparagenesis is observed, which is formed together with a pro-\nduction of 10 to 15% partial melting, close to exhaustion \nof biotite and just above the cordierite stability field for this \nbulk composition. This is in agreement with field\u00a0and petro-\ngraphic observation, as thin leucosome veins are observed \nwithin the felsic granulite (Figs. 6A and 6B). Therefore, the \nmetamorphic peak conditions are achieved crossing biotite \nbreakdown/melting reaction, producing a granulite residue \nand orthopyroxene-bearing melt, now represented by leu-\ncosome. The low amount of partial melting is constrained \nby low fertility of this kind of protolith, as well as by low \namount of available water.\n\nLarger amounts of leucosome, observed in association \nwith the garnet-cordierite diatexite, are compatible with cal-\nculated P-T conditions, if it is considered that the follow-\ning reaction was crossed during the progressive stage of rock \nP-T path: sillimanite + biotite + quartz = garnet + cordierite \n+ orthoclase + liquid, in the KFMASH system, although \nplagioclase might be added as reactant as well (Spear et\u00a0al. \n1999). Through the partial melting modeling of pelite, or \nadding plagioclase to have an aluminum-rich greywacke as \nprotolith, the rock can cross this reaction at the calculated \nP-T conditions, producing, at least, 50% of partial melt \nand a residue dominated by cordierite and garnet, devoid \nof sillimanite, with minor amounts of or no biotite, as sug-\ngested by pseudosections calculated with sedimentary bulk \ncompositions (White &amp; Powell 2002; White et\u00a0al. 2007; \nJohnson et\u00a0al. 2008).\n\nThe genesis of felsic granulite and garnet-cordierite dia-\ntexite is deeply associated with partial melting reactions, \nproduction of a melt phase, which was segregated, leaving \nbehind different kinds of residues that, in turn, were controlled \nby\u00a0different bulk compositions. The more fertile  composition \nproduced large amounts of melt and a residue constituted \nof different amounts of cordierite and garnet from a pelite \nor an aluminum-rich greywacke. In any case, the protolith \n\nwas richer in biotite than in sillimanite, since the latter min-\neral is observed only as an inclusion in cordierite or garnet, \nbut never in the matrix. The less fertile felsic granulite pro-\nduced a smaller amount of melt, evidenced by thin layers \nof orthopyroxene-bearing leucosome. In both cases, inde-\npendently of the amount of generated melt, a fair portion \nof it was segregated and, probably, lost, contributing to the \ngenerous magmatism observed in the area. This inference \nrelies on the fact that, in both rock types, orthopyroxene, \ncordierite or garnet are preserved and only a small amount \nof grains present retrogression textures, as rim replacement \nby biotite-bearing symplectite. This kind of reaction texture \nis interpreted as the result of retrograde reaction between \nperitectic phases and entrapped melt (Kriegsman &amp; Hensen \n1998). If no melt is lost, the peritectic phases should be \ncompletely consumed during cooling, as the stoichiometry \nratio of produced phases along the progressive path is not \nchanged. Therefore, all peritectic phases would react back \nwith melt to produce reactant phases, as biotite, sillimanite, \nquartz and feldspars (White &amp; Powell 2002). If fractions of \nproduced melt are segregated and lost, only partial retrogres-\nsion occurs, and preservation of peritectic phases is possible \nif all, or at least most, melt is segregated from the residue \n(Moraes et\u00a0al. 2002; White &amp; Powell 2002).\n\nConsidering an average crust with an intermediate bulk \ncomposition, between andesite and tonalite (Wedepohl \n1991), with density varying between 2.6 and 2.7 g/cm3, a \ndepth of 25 to 26.5 km is needed to produce a lithostatic \npressure of 7 kbar, of middle crust setting, leading to a gra-\ndient of 32-34\u00b0C/km, which is a little higher than typical \nbarrovian metamorphism, requiring a higher thermal gra-\ndient that can be produced by incoming heat of contem-\nporaneous granite intrusions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThermobarometry\nThe calculations made with THERMOCALC used the \n\nwhole metamorphic peak mineral assemblage, and produced \nthe most reliable P-T results, as they are more consistent \n\nTable 5.

The most consistent \nP-T results for the investigated felsic granulites are 7 kbar \nand 850\u00b0C, calculated with low water activity, aH2O = 0.3. \nThe\u00a0results are in agreement with P-T calculations made for \nthe garnet-cordierite diatexite. These conditions are compat-\nible with the orthopyroxene, cordierite and sillimanite sta-\nbility fields for protoliths, respectively, of greywacke/granite \nand bulk pelite compositions. It is interesting to note that \nan optimum value of water activity could be found for the \nfelsic granulite, as the lowest uncertainties and coherent P-T \nvalues were calculated, but for the garnet-cordierite diatex-\nite, water activity radically changes the values of calculated \ntemperature, but does not influence too much the results \nof calculated pressure.\n\nThe P-T results obtained with conventional meth-\nods of thermobarometry, using garnet and orthopyroxene \ncompositions, are somewhat ambiguous, either because \nlow temperatures are calculated and are not compatible \nwith the orthopyroxene stability field, or due to calculated \nhigh pressures, which are outside the stability field of cord-\nierite/sillimanite, present in the most abundant rock in the \narea, the garnet-cordierite diatexite. The calibrations done \nfor the orthopyroxene and garnet pair, as thermometer or \nbarometer, are based, respectively, on Fe-Mg and tschermak \nexchanges. Some were designed to work better for rocks \nwhere orthopyroxene presents high concentrations of alu-\nminum. However,\u00a0even the barometer calibrations are very \nsensitive to later Fe-Mg exchange, producing results that \nare not valid without corrections (Pattison &amp; B\u00e9gin 1994; \nFitzsimons &amp; Harley 1994). Some of the problems may be \nrelated to expressions derived from experiments that were \nnot truly reversed, producing imprecise expressions to cal-\nculate pressure and temperature (Pattison 1994). Although \nboth calibrations of the garnet-orthopyroxene barometer \nfailed to produce reliable results, calculations run with the \nGAPES barometer yielded, within the uncertainties, results \nconsistent with the ones calculated with THERMOCALC \nand are considered to have geological value.\n\nP-T calculation for granulites using either conventional \nthermobarometry or THERMOCALC can result in equiv-\nalent results, the reliability of which experiences the same \nconstraints, i.e. late re-equilibrium between Fe and Mg or \nconsumption of these phases due to the presence of trapped \nmelt (Spear 1991; Spear &amp; Florence 1992; White &amp; Powell \n2002, 2010; Moraes et\u00a0al. 2002; Pattison et\u00a0al. 2003). For \nmigmatites this might be an even harder and complex situ-\nation to investigate, because in many cases it becomes dif-\nficult to evaluate, based on the texture, if all phases were in \nchemical equilibrium during metamorphic peak, especially \nplagioclase and biotite, which can be crystallized from the \n\ntrapped melt, but due to some late deformation, might look \nin textural equilibrium with other phases, which did not \nreally coexist during the metamorphic peak. This problem \ncan be accessed using a pseudosection that is a map of all \nmineral assemblages allowed by a determined bulk com-\nposition, inside a P-T window. However, the beauty of the \nmethod is also its doom, as it is necessary to know the orig-\ninal protolith bulk composition, which for a migmatite is \ndifficult, or even impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to use \na hypothetical bulk composition or try to find a rock that \nis the low-grade equivalent of migmatite.\n\nSillimanite is clearly in petrographic disequilibrium \nwith the metamorphic peak mineral assemblage. However, \nno good P-T calculation was possible without this mineral, \ngiven that it helps to balance and produce a larger amount \nof reactions, helping to produce a set of linear indepen-\ndent reactions. Therefore, all P-T calculations done for the \ngarnet-cordierite diatexite must be taken as, at least, sus-\npicious. Adding sillimanite to the mineral assemblage will \nforce THERMOCALC to calculate a point over the uni-\nvariant KFMASH reaction or inside a divariant field in the \nNCKFMASH field. This produces a minimum P-T con-\ndition for the mineral assemblage of the garnet-cordierite \ndiatexite. Consequently, all P-T calculations done for the \nfelsic granulite produced more reliable results.\n\nTectonic implications \nof obtained results\n\nAs shown above, the study region underwent metamor-\nphism and partial melting in a crust with a thermal gradi-\nent of 32 \u2013 34\u00b0C/km, with metamorphic peak achieved at \ndepths of 25 to 26.5 km. These conditions are somewhat \nhigher than typical barrovian metamorphism, and probably \nimply a hot middle portion of thickened continental crust \nor lower portions of thinned crust. The mid crust is a more \nfavorable tectonic setting, as studied rocks are inserted into \nthe Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen, a hot orogen in which several episodes \nof granite magmatism are recorded. It started with the G1 \npre-colisional suite, with ages spanning from 630 to 585 Ma; \nthe G2 and G3 suites are constituted of S-type granites, with \nages between 585 and 535 Ma, and are coeval to high-grade \nmetamorphism, which involved formation of granulites and \ndiatexites, investigated in this research; two post-collisional \ngranite suites known as G4 suite also of S-type granite, and \nG5 suite, made of charnockites, both forming high sug-\nar-loafs in the region, crystallized between 520 and 490 Ma \n(see Gradim et\u00a0al. 2014 and references therein). With such \nevolution, from granulite facies metamorphic peak to intru-\nsion of later suites, including very hot charnockite magmas, \na time span of almost 100 Ma is needed, and along all this \ntime the mid crust was necessarily either hot or heated, at \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 45(4): 517-539, December 2015\n534\n\nThermobarometry in migmatites and granulites\n\n\n\nleast twice, for metamorphic peak, and then for the forma-\ntion of hot post-collisional granite magmas.\n\nA significant portion of granulites is formed in middle \nto lower continental thickened crust in collisional tectonic \nsettings, similar to the roots of the Himalayas (England &amp; \nThompson 1984; Ellis 1987; Harley 1989, 1992; Ashwall \net\u00a0al. 1992; Collins 2002; Jamieson et\u00a0al. 2004). However, \na major problem identified in such a tectonic setting is the \nlack of enough heat produced only by decay of radioactive \nelements, and another complimentary heat source is needed \n(England &amp; Thompson 1984; Ellis 1987; Harley 1989, 1992; \nAshwall et\u00a0al. 1992; Jamieson et\u00a0al. 1998). Several mod-\nels are available: underplating of hot basalt magma (Wells \n1980; Elllis 1987; Bohlen 1987, 1991; Bohlen &amp; Mezger \n1989); an additional layer of continental crust material \nrich in radioactive elements (TARM), subducted at mantle \nlevel (Jamieson et\u00a0al. 1998); removal of a thermal bound-\nary layer due to convection of the asthenosphere, causing \na huge thermal anomaly at the bottom of the orogen that \nwill be followed by high-grade metamorphism, rising topog-\nraphy, extensional collapse and granite and basalt magma-\ntism (England 1994). Modern techniques are able to take \ninto account a larger number of parameters, used\u00a0to gener-\nate complex mathematical models, which are closer to\u00a0real \nsituations, presenting more consistent results than the early \nones. Modeling for the Himalayan Orogeny solved the prob-\nlem of heat source starting with a pre-heated crust and over-\nthrusting hot migmatites over the down going rocks that \nwere being heated due to collision, leading to partial melt-\ning and granulite facies conditions, with peak temperature \nover 900\u00b0C that are easily produced within the mountain \nchain (Jamieson et\u00a0al. 2004). Nevertheless, in all the models, \ngranulite facies conditions are achieved at pressure greater \nthan 8 kbar and this is not in agreement with calculated \nP-T conditions for the investigated rocks and an alternative \nmodel must be considered, as well as a way to heat up the \ncrust twice in the same tectonic event.\n\nIt is possible to pre-heat the continental crust in a back-\narc basin setting due to the movement of shallow mantle \nconvection currents. Subsequent closure of the basin estab-\nlishes an ideal setting to produce granites, migmatites and \ngranulites, under medium pressure conditions (Hyndman \net\u00a0al. 2005). This model was proposed with great success to \nexplain the evolution of the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen (Gradim 2013; \nGradim et\u00a0al. 2014). This type of tectonic setting encom-\npasses the ideal characteristics for generation of most of the \nobserved geology of the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen. The back-arc clo-\nsure results in the edification of the orogen, induced by con-\ntinental collision, followed by high-grade metamorphism, \npartial melting and granite magmatism, and later followed \nby the gravitational collapse of the orogen (Pedrosa-Soares \n\net\u00a0al. 2007). After this, the crust should be submitted to \nerosion and cooling in order to achieve isostatic equilib-\nrium. This imposes a drawback to the model, as no heat \nsource will be available to produce the younger G4 and G5 \nsuites, especially the last one constituted of very hot char-\nnockite magma. Another heating event is needed. What is \nthe cause for a new heating event to produce such import-\nant hot magmatism?\n\nThe tectonic switching model is based on alternating \nregimes of extension and contraction of continental crust, \ninduced by changes in the angle of slab subduction that, in \nturn, is controlled by intermittent arrival of buoyant oce-\nanic plateaus (Collins 2002). This is almost the base for the \nmodel proposed by Hyndman et\u00a0al. (2005). However,\u00a0as tec-\ntonic switching may happen more than once, it offers the \npossibility of more than one heating stage in the same oro-\ngen. In this model, cycles of flat to steep subduction result \nin episodes of crustal thickening followed by extension, and \nmore than one event of high-grade metamorphism and par-\ntial melting might be generated.\n\nThe tectonic switching model may enhance the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed \nOrogen evolution. The closure of a basin with a pre-heated \ncrust producing high-grade metamorphism and partial \nmelting (G2 and G3 suites) during crustal thickening is fol-\nlowed by flat subduction, induced by basalt plateau entering \ninto the subduction zone that will cause a stage of tectonic \nquiescence. After the plateau is subducted, the subduction \nslab changes to a steeper regime, causing tectonic roll-back, \ncrust extension, advection of hot asthenosphere that during \ndecompression produces basaltic magma and a thermal \nanomaly at the base of the continental crust, after the first \nmain metamorphism and magmatism event. A new high-\ngrade metamorphic event associated with extensive granite \nand charnockite magma production takes place in a younger \nperiod, represented by the G4 and G5 suites. The effect of \nthis later extension caused by tectonic switching should \nnot be different from a gravitational collapse produced by \nremoval of the thermal boundary layer as proposed in other \nmodels (England 1994). The advantage of tectonic switching \nis the possibility of a new heating event later in the orogen \nevolution, producing extensive magmatism, with contribu-\ntion from mantle and crustal sources. It also should produce \nanother high-grade metamorphic event, with the same age \nas G4 and G5 suites, which is not reported so far, but might \nbe a nice possibility for future investigations.\n\nAlthough the tectonic switching model may explain the \ntime spam between main metamorphism/G2-G3 Granite \nSuites and later G4 and G5 Suites, it requires a longer period \nof subduction. As the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen is semi-confined, the \nnutcracker tectonic model was proposed and it explains most \nof the features observed (Alkmim et\u00a0al. 2006), however it \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 45(4): 517-539, December 2015\n535\n\nRenato Moraes et al.\n\n\n\ndoes not require extensive subduction of oceanic crust and \nit opposes with the tectonic switching. Another point that \nmust be evaluated is how far the change in the subduction \nangle can affect the inner portions of the orogen, because \nrocks of the Jequitinhonha Complex lay on the ensialic \nportion of the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen, in its innermost portion. \nAlthough the tectonic switching model can explain some \nfeatures, it is not perfect, but it is an interesting option to \nbe further investigated.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn southern Bahia, granulites and migmatites of the \nJequitinhonha Complex constitute an important portion \nof the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen (Sampaio et\u00a0al. 2004). These\u00a0rocks \nunderwent granulite facies metamorphism with meta-\nmorphic peak conditions of 850\u00b0C and 7 kbar. Assorted \nmethods to calculate P-T conditions were used and opti-\nmal thermobarometry using THERMOCALC produced \na more consistent set of results. This method also brings \nthe advantage to be able to investigate the presence, \ncomposition and influence of the fluid phase. For the \ngarnet-cordierite diatexite, a water rich fluid produces \nbetter results, but for the felsic granulite a fluid with \nwater activity of 0.3 yielded the most consistent statis-\ntical values for pressure and temperature. These results \nare also compatible with the stability field of the mineral \nassemblage constituted of garnet + cordierite + orthoclase \n+ quartz coexisting with a melt phase, as well as with \n\northopyroxene + garnet + plagioclase + quartz, respec-\ntively, in garnet-cordierite diatexite and felsic granulite. \nEven\u00a0if the value of 8 kbar, produced by conventional \nbarometry, is used, it is also compatible with observed \nmineral assemblages. These P-T conditions are also in \nagreement with the KFMASH melting reaction of sil-\nlimanite + biotite, in presence of quartz and feldspars, \nwhich was the reaction crossed by pelites to produce the \ngarnet-cordierite diatexite that dominates the geology of \nthis region (Sampaio et\u00a0al. 2004).\n\nThe calculated P-T conditions are compatible with tec-\ntonic settings of the middle crust with high geothermal gra-\ndient, which matches either a magmatic arc setting or por-\ntions of back-arc basin, as proposed before for these rocks \n(Noce et\u00a0al. 2004; Pedrosa-Soares et\u00a0al. 2006; Silva et\u00a0al. \n2008; Roncato 2009; Gradim 2013; Gradim et\u00a0al. 2014). \nThe tectonic switching model enhances the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogen \nevolution in comparison with previous proposals, as it can \nexplain the time gap between main metamorphism and \nassociated G2 suite with later and hot G4 and G5 suites.\n\nAcknowledgments: The authors thank the agreement \nCAPES-COFECUB, Brazil-France, 624/09, which financed \nthe present research and CBPM, Companhia Bahiana de \nPesquisa Mineral, for the assistance during the fieldwork and \npreparation of samples.
