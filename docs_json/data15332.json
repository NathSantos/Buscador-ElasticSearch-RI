O \nchoco \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie de grande import\u00e2ncia para a economia local de Aveiro, \nconsiderando os dados globais de capturas desta esp\u00e9cie para a Ria de Aveiro. No \nentanto, os estudos acerca desta esp\u00e9cie na Ria de Aveiro s\u00e3o escassos, desta \nforma o presente estudo pretende preencher esta lacuna de informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o \nchoco na Ria de Aveiro. O choco entra para a Ria na primavera e no ver\u00e3o para \nreprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, e volta para \u00e1guas mais profundas no inverno. Em termos de \nabund\u00e2ncia, as zonas, este e central da ria, a mais pr\u00f3xima da embocadura com o \nmar, apresentaram os valores de abund\u00e2ncia mais elevados, sendo as regi\u00f5es mais \na norte e a sul dos principais canais, as de abund\u00e2ncia mais baixa. Este fato pode \nestar relacionado com fatores abi\u00f3ticos, como a profundidade, a salinidade e a \ntemperatura. No ponto mais a sul da Ria de Aveiro (Are\u00e3o) nunca foram capturados \nchocos, tendo este local apresentado os valores mais baixos de salinidade e \nprofundidade. \nO choco apresenta um crescimento alom\u00e9trico, sendo as f\u00eameas mais pesadas que \nos machos, para comprimentos do manto superiores a 82.4 mm. Os machos \natingem a matura\u00e7\u00e3o sexual primeiro que as f\u00eameas. Na Ria de Aveiro apenas uma \ngera\u00e7\u00e3o de progenitores foi encontrada. O choco apresenta-se como predador \noportunista, consumindo uma grande diversidade de presas de diferentes grupos \ntaxon\u00f3micos. A dieta mostrou-se semelhante nos diferentes locais de amostragem \nobservando-se diferen\u00e7as significativas para as esta\u00e7\u00f5es do ano. \nS. officinalis foi capturada em 10 locais da Ria de Aveiro com contamina\u00e7\u00e3o de \ndiferentes origens antropog\u00e9nicas. Assim, os n\u00edveis de metais analisados \napresentaram-se semelhantes em todos os locais de amostragem, com a exce\u00e7\u00e3o \nde uma \u00e1rea restricta, o largo do Laranjo, que apresentou valores mais elevados. O \nchoco possui a capacidade de acumular metais no seu organismo. Os n\u00edveis de Fe, \nZn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Hg encontrados no manto e na gl\u00e2ndula digestiva refletem uma \nacumula\u00e7\u00e3o diferencial de metais nos tecidos. Esta acumula\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 relacionada \ncom o tipo e fun\u00e7\u00e3o do tecido analisado e com o tipo de metal analisado (essencial \ne n\u00e3o essencial). As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es dos metais na gl\u00e2ndula digestiva s\u00e3o mais \nelevadas que no manto, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o do merc\u00fario. Este fato pode dever-se \u00e0 \ngrande afinidade do manto para a incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de Metilmerc\u00fario (MeHg), a mais \nabundante forma de merc\u00fario. A acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de metais pode variar ao longo da \nvida, dependendo do metal. As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de Zn, Cd and Hg aumentam ao \nlongo da vida, o Pb diminui e os metais essenciais como o Fe e Cu permanecem \nconstantes. Os dados recolhidos sugerem que o choco (Sepia officinalis) possa ser \nusado como bioindicador de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental para alguns metais. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \n\nCuttlefish, life Cycle, sexual maturity, metals, bioacumulation, digestive gland, Ria de \nAveiro \n\nabstract \n\n \n\nThe common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is a necto-benthic cephalopod that can live \nin coastal ecosystems, with high influence of anthropogenic pressures and thus be \nvulnerable to exposure to various types of contaminants. The cuttlefish is a species \nof great importance to the local economy of Aveiro, considering the global data of \ncatches of this species in the Ria de Aveiro. However, studies on this species in Ria \nde Aveiro are scarce, so the present study aims to fill this information gap about the \ncuttlefish in the Ria de Aveiro. The cuttlefish enters Ria de Aveiro in the spring and \nsummer to reproduce, returning to deeper waters in the winter. In terms of \nabundance, the eastern and center regions of the lagoon, closer to the sea, showed \nthe highest values of abundance, while the northern and southern regions of the \nmain channel had the lowest abundance. This fact may be related to abiotic factors, \nas well as depth, salinity and temperature. In the most southern point of the Ria de \nAveiro (Are\u00e3o) no cuttlefish was caught. This site had the lowest values of salinity \nand depth. \nThe cuttlefish has an allometric the females being heavier than males to mantle \nlengths greater than 82.4 mm. Males reach sexual maturity first than females. In Ria \nde Aveiro in a generation of parents was found. The cuttlefish, presents itself as \nopportunistic predators, consuming a wide variety of prey from different taxa. The \ndiet was similar in different sampling locations observing significant differences for \nthe seasons. \nS. officinalis was captured at 10 sites in the Ria de Aveiro with different \nanthropogenic sources of contamination. Thus, levels of metals analyzed were \nsimilar at all sampling sites, with the exception of a restricted area, Laranjo, which \nshowed higher values. The cuttlefish has the ability to accumulate metals in your \nbody. The levels of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Hg found in the digestive gland and \nmantle reflect a differential accumulation of metals in the tissues. This accumulation \nis related to the type and function of tissue analyzed and the type of metal analysis \n(essential and non-essential). The metal concentrations in the digestive gland are \nhigher than in the mantle, with the exception of mercury. This may be due to the high \naffinity of the mantle for the incorporation of methylmercury (MeHg), the most \nabundant form of mercury. The accumulation of metals can vary over a lifetime, \ndepending on the metal. The concentrations of Zn, Cd and Hg increases throughout \nlife, while Pb decreases and essential metals such as Fe and Cu remain constant. \nThe data collected suggest that the cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) can be used as a \nbioindicator of environmental contamination for some metals. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n| P a g e 3 \n\nLIST OF CONTENTS \n\nLIST OF FIGURES ..................................................................................................................... 9 \n\nLIST OF TABLES .................................................................................................................... 13 \n\nLIST OF SYMBOLS AND ABREVIATIONS ....................................................................... 15 \n\nI.

General Introduction \n\nI.1. Coastal Environment \u2013 An overview \n\nCoastal environments are dynamic ecosystems where land, water and atmosphere \n\ninteract in a delicate natural balance that is constantly affected by natural and human \n\ninfluence (Lopes et al., 2011). Consequently these ecosystems are easily susceptible to \n\ndetrimental environmental impact from pollution or by other human activities (Pombo, \n\n2005). Natural pressures include storms, wind, tides, waves, sea level change and runoff \n\n(Lopes et al., 2011), while anthropogenic pressures include random urbanization and \n\nindustrialization, unregulated wastewater discharges (domestic and industrial waste) and \n\nreduction of resources (overfishing and unplanned coastal agriculture) (Rabouille et al., \n\n2007). Coastal lagoons belong to these important ecosystems and are among the most \n\nproductive ecosystems of the biosphere, where several organisms use the lagoon for \n\nnesting, feeding, nursery or sheltering (McLuscky and Elliott, 2004; Sousa et al., 2010). \n\nThese productive areas are attractive and accessible to people and therefore densely \n\npopulated, making the anthropogenic pressures an important factor in their evolution \n\n(Lopes et al., 2011). Aproximately 44 % of the world's population (more people than \n\ninhabited the entire globe in 1950) live within 150 km of the coast. In 2001 over half the \n\nworld's population lived within 200 km of a coastline. Moreover, increasing volumes of \n\nwaste, particularly sewage, are discharged into coastal waters with little or no treatment, \n\nwhat can cause eutrophication and endanger public health (UN Atlas of the Oceans, \n\n2010). Concerns of adverse long-term contaminant effects on aquatic ecosystems \n\nemerged in the last decades (Van der Oost et al., 2003). The protection, improvement \n\nand sustainable use of Europe\u00b4s water resources are the main goals of current European \n\nWater Policy (Kowalshi, 2009). In order to achieve this aim, legislation is defined by \n\nthe European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD). The great objective is to \n\nachieve good quality water status for all European aquatic ecosystems until 2015. \n\nHowever, the complexity and dynamics of these coastal environments and the constant \n\nchange of these ecosystems due to natural causes may overlap the effects of the \n\nanthropogenic pressures, hampering the monitoring and the management of these \n\nimportant aquatic ecosystems.  \n\n \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771413001832#bib43\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 22 \n\nI.2. Tools for monitoring aquatic systems \n\nMetal pollution has been an environmental issue in many developed and developing \n\ncountries for decades, and there is a substantial need to understand the bioaccumulation \n\nand toxicity of metals in aquatic organisms (Wang and Rainbow, 2008). Over the last \n\ntwo or three decades, researchers proposed the use of living organisms in parallel with \n\nphysical-chemical analyses to determine geographical and/or temporal variations in the \n\nbioavailable concentrations of trace metals, in order to evaluate the health state of the \n\naquatic systems (Amiard et al., 1998; Rainbow and Phillips, 1993). Considering this, \n\nbiomonitoring was defined as the systematic use of biological responses to evaluate \n\nchanges in the environment (Cairns and Van der Schalie, 1980). This approach is based \n\non the knowledge that chemicals which have entered the organisms leave markers \n\nreflecting that exposure. The marker may be the chemical itself, a breakdown product or \n\na biological change in the organism as a result of the action of the chemical (Kowalshi, \n\n2009).  \n\n \n\nI.2.1. Bioindicator, biomonitors or sentinel species \n\nBioindicators, biomonitors or sentinel species can be defined as species which \n\naccumulate contaminants in their tissues (Beeby, 2001). Their use to identify regions \n\nwith high concentrations of trace metals and synthetic organic concentrations in aquatic \n\necosystems is particularly well established, especially in temperate regions. \n\nBioindicators can provide a time-integrated measure of bioavailability, responding, by \n\ndefinition, to the fraction present in the environment which is of direct ecotoxicological \n\nrelevance (Phillips and Rainbow, 1993). Individual bioindicators respond differently to \n\ndifferent sources of bioavailable metal, for example, in solution, in sediment or in food. \n\nTo gain a complete representation of total trace metal bioavailability in a marine system \n\nit is necessary, therefore, to use a set of bioindicators species, reflecting metal \n\nbioavailability in all available sources (Phillips, 1990; Rainbow, 1990, 1993; Phillips \n\nand Rainbow 1993; Rainbow and Phillips, 1993; Galloway et al., 2004). Such \n\ncomparative use of different biomonitors should allow identification of the particular \n\nsource of the contaminant metal (Phillips and Rainbow, 1988, 1993). For example, a \n\nmacrophytic algae responds essentially to dissolved metal sources, a suspension feeder \n\nlike a mussel responds to metal sources in dissolved and suspended phases, and a \n\ndeposit feeder responds to metal available in the sediment. \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 23 \n\nTrace metals bioindicators need to conform to certain required characteristics, not \n\nleast being metal accumulators (Butler et al., 1971; Bryan et al., 1980; Phillips, 1990; \n\nPhillips and Rainbow, 1993). Ideal bioindicators should be sedentary, easy to identify, \n\nabundant, long lived, available for sampling throughout the year, large enough to \n\nprovide sufficient tissue for (individual) analysis, resistant to handling stress caused by \n\nlaboratory studies of metal kinetics and/or field transplantations, tolerant of exposure to \n\nenvironmental variations in physical-chemical parameters such as salinity, and net \n\naccumulators of the metal in question with a simple correlation between metal \n\nconcentration in tissues (body) and average ambient bioavailable metal concentration \n\nover a recent time period (Rainbow, 1995). However, not all bioindicators organisms \n\nfollow all these criteria. Bivalves, particularly mussels, are one of the most relevant \n\nsentinel species (NOAA, 2004), as they are used in international environmental \n\nmonitoring programs of marine contaminants as part of \u201cMussel Watch Programme\u201d of \n\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Goldeberg et al. 1983). Fishes \n\nare good contamination indicators but despite having a considerable commercial value, \n\nthey have great mobility. Along with fish, plankton is also used as bioindicator but \n\nstrongly depend of the currents and local conditions and their sampling is often difficult. \n\nMolluscs, and especially mussels, are the most used organisms to monitor trace metals \n\nin coastal environments due to their abundance, physiology and distribution (Pimenta, \n\n2010). \n\nBioindicators species in biomonitoring programs can have different uses (Beeby, \n\n2001):  \n\na) As accumulators, when used to increase analytical sensitivity for a contaminant; \n\nto compare the scale of contamination between sites, and to summarize a complex \n\npollution signal;  \n\nb) As integrators, when used to provide a running mean over time and space;  \n\nc) As a measure of exposure, when used to quantify bioavailability of a pollutant \n\nfrom a particular source. \n\n \n\nI.2.2. Biomarkers \n\nA biological marker or biomarker is defined as quantifiable behavioural, physiological, \n\nhistological, biochemical or genetic property that is used to measure response to an \n\nenvironmental change (Nordberg et al., 2009). The use of biomarkers measured at the \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 24 \n\nmolecular or cellular level have been proposed as sensitive \u2018early warning\u2019 tools for \n\nbiological effect measurement in environmental quality assessment (McCarthy and \n\nShugart, 1990). Newly the use of biomarker approach has been incorporated into several \n\npollution monitoring programmes in Europe and the USA (e.g. the NOAA\u2019s National \n\nStatus and Trends Program). The United Nations Environment Programme has funded a \n\nbiomonitoring programme in the Mediterranean Sea including a variety of biomarkers \n\n(UNEP, 1997). Recently, biomarkers have also been included in the Joint Monitoring \n\nProgramme of the OSPAR convention where Portugal and Spain are members \n\n(Cajaraville et al., 2000). \n\nConsidering the definitions of the World Health Organisation (1993), biomarkers can be \n\nclassified as:  \n\na) biomarkers of exposure: an exogenous substance or its metabolite or the \n\nproduct of an interaction between a xenobiotic agent and some target \n\nmolecule or cell that is measured in a compartment within an organism; \n\nb) biomarkers of effect: a measurable biochemical, physiological, behavioral or \n\nother alteration within an organism that, depending upon the magnitude, can \n\nbe recognized as associated with an established or possible health \n\nimpairment or disease; \n\nc) Biomarkers of susceptibility: an indicator of an inherent or acquired ability \n\nof an organism to respond to the challenge of exposure to a specific \n\nxenobiotic substance. \n\nOne of the most important features of molecular/cellular biomarkers is that they \n\nhave the potential to anticipate changes at higher levels of biological organisation, i.e. \n\npopulation, community or ecosystem. Thus these \u2018early warning\u2019 biomarkers can be \n\nused in a predictive way, allowing the initiation of bioremediation strategies before \n\nirreversible environmental damage of ecological consequences occurs.

Essential metals always function in \n\ncombination with organic molecules, usually proteins (Blackmore, 1998). For example, \n\nCu, Zn and Fe are important components of the catalytic sites of enzymes, respiratory \n\nproteins and certain structural elements of the organisms (Depledge and Rainbow, \n\n1990). Other metals like Pb, Hg and Cd may relocate or substitute essential metals and \n\ninterfere with the good functioning of the enzymes and associated cofactors (Van der \n\nOost et al., 2003). As mentioned previously some trace metals are essential in low \n\nconcentrations for the metabolism of organisms, but in excess all trace metals are toxic. \n\nIn the environment, metals occur in a variety of forms or species affecting their toxicity \n\n(McLusky et al., 1986; Rainbow, 1997a). Besides, the toxicity of metal mixtures often \n\ncannot be predicted based on the toxicity of individual metals (Chapman et al., 2003). \n\nIn addition, some of these elements appear in high concentrations in certain organs of \n\nthe aquatic organisms, and the question is if it results from biological processes or \n\ninfluenced by the increasing availability in contaminant environments. \n\nThere are three fates for trace metals in aquatic ecosystems: a) precipitation, which \n\noccurs when the concentration of the metal is higher than its solubility and where \n\nchanges in solubility will occur with, for example, pH or when freshwater meets \n\nseawater in an estuary; b) adsorption, onto both inorganic and organic matter; and c) \n\nabsorption by marine organisms (Bryan, 1979). The inputs of metals into marine \n\necosystems have several causes like effluent discharges, fluvial currents and by the \n\natmosphere. Once in the water, metals adsorbed on the suspended particles and then \n\naccumulate in the sediment (Ramalhosa et al., 2001; Ramalhosa et al., 2006), which can \n\nserve as sink or source of metals to the overlying water column (Fichet et al., 1999; \n\nBaeyers et al., 2003). Marine and estuarine sediments bind and accumulate a wide \n\nvariety of trace metals to often high concentrations, and can be redistributed by \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 26 \n\ndisturbances (including bioturbation by animals), and anthropogenic activities such as \n\ndredging (Chapman et al., 2003). Several marine organisms live a substantial part of \n\ntheir life in or on the sediment, which enhances the possibility to incorporate those \n\nmetals. The sediment-water transferences of metals are controlled by two types of flux. \n\nThe advective flux, when the transference of metals between the sediment and the water \n\ncolumn is conducted by an external factor, such as tidal currents or bioturbation. And, \n\nthe diffuse flux where the natural diffusion of metals occurs between the two phases, \n\nwith a direction and rang depending on the depleted/enriched section (Point et al., \n\n2007). The mineralization of organic matter plays an important role in the sediment-\n\nwater interactions (Kowalshi, 2009). Iron and Mn oxides in the sediment are important \n\nscavengers for metals. However, during this process, ions Mn\n2+\n\n and Fe\n2+\n\n and associated \n\ntrace metals (Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd) can be released into the pore-water and diffuse upward \n\ndue to concentration gradients. According to Miao et al., 2006 this process is largely \n\naffected by Eh and pH. \n\n \n\nI.4. Sequestration of metals in aquatic organisms \n\nSequestration of metals in organisms occurs throughout the various tissues involved \n\nin pathways for metal uptake, storage, elimination and detoxification (Figure I.1). \n\n \n\nFigure I.1 - Sequestration of metals (uptake, storage, elimination and detoxification (Adapted \n\nfrom Pimenta, 2010). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 27 \n\nI.4.1. Uptake of metals \n\nThe uptake of metals in aquatic organisms can occur through different \n\nmechanisms: from water, suspended particles and sediments, or by food. The \n\naccumulation of trace elements directly by water is a crucial point to consider in the \n\nevaluation of the adverse effects on ecosystems (Van der Oost et al., 2003). Indeed, \n\nthere are many works that use the accumulation of trace elements in organisms as mean \n\nto evaluate the environmental health condition (Fernandes et al., 2007; Bustamante et \n\nal., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009). The internal transport of metal is made via circulatory \n\nsystem (Roesijadi and Robinson, 1994). The pathways of trace metal transport across \n\nthe biological membrane have been well hypothesized, such as the passive diffusion of \n\nneutral metal species across the membrane, facilitated diffusion of metals via membrane \n\ntransporter proteins, access through major ion channels (e.g., Ca channels) perhaps in \n\nassociation with active ion pumps, and endocytosis (Simkiss and Taylor, 1995; Hudson, \n\n1998). Pumps and channels are in the membranes, and have hydrophobic segments that \n\nbind metals. The carriers are liposoluble molecules which bind to metals in one side of \n\nmembranes, make the passage and transport the metal to the solution on the opposite \n\nside of the membrane (Hudson, 1998). Dissolved metals are mainly taken up by \n\nexposed body surfaces such as the gills, whereas particulate metals are mostly ingested \n\nand then taken up after solubilisation in the gut. Uptake of essential metals (e.g. Cu, Fe \n\nand Zn), often involves specific pathways like, calcium channels and specific membrane \n\ncarriers for Fe and Cu. For common divalent metals such as Cd and Zn, there are two \n\ndifferent types of binding sites at the gill surface, a high-affinity, low-capacity site, and \n\na low-affinity, high-capacity site. At a relatively low ambient metal concentration, \n\nmetals are bound to the high-affinity, low-capacity site, and uptake exhibits a saturation \n\npattern with increasing ambient metal concentrations. At a high ambient metal \n\nconcentration, following the saturation of the high-affinity sites, metals are bound to the \n\nlow-affinity, high-capacity site, and uptake increases linearly with increasing ambient \n\nmetal concentration (Wang and Rainbow, 2008). For non-essential elements such as Hg, \n\nspecific uptake mechanisms are unknown and so, it\u2019s believed that they should follow \n\nthe existing pathways for essential metals (Hudson, 1998, Sunda and Huntsman, 1998). \n\nUptake of non-essential metals is almost totally determined by the degree of exposure. \n\nIn contrast, accumulation of some essential metals may be less influenced by external \n\nconcentrations, suggesting various degrees of homeostasis (Langston et al. 1998). In \n\naddition, numerous environmental and biological factors including dissolved metal \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651305000151#bib84\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 28 \n\ninteractions (Amiard-Triquet and Amiard, 1998) have been considered for their \n\ninfluence on trace metal uptake and bioaccumulation. \n\nIn organisms without external shells, as cephalopods, the uptake from water can \n\ntake place in the gills but also in all body surface, and in all molluscs some absorption \n\nof dissolved metal across the digestive epithelium (Langston et al., 1998). Food may \n\nalso be a significant source of metals, if not the primary source, to organisms (Wang, \n\n2002). For marine organisms dietary uptake (trophic transfer) is the predominant \n\npathway by which metals are accumulated, primarily because of the very low dissolved \n\nuptake rate of metals (Xu and Wang, 2002; Zhang and Wang, 2006a, b). \n\n \n\nI.4.2. Bioaccumulation \n\nBioaccumulation in a tissue can be considered as a balance between two kinetic \n\nprocesses accumulation and elimination of an element (Connel and Miller, 1984, Brown \n\nand Depledge, 1998). Generally, the accumulation of metals occurs in a pattern \n\ndescribed in the Figure I.2. When an organism is exposed to a metal, levels increase \n\nlogarithmically until adsorption sites become full (Langston et al., 1998), leading to a \n\nreduction in the accumulation. The elimination process becomes clear when a decrease \n\nin metal levels in the tissues of the organisms is observed. However, not all the metals \n\nare rapidly eliminated, depending on its half-life. Metal exposure may induce specific \n\nmetal detoxification processes or physiological and biochemical changes that can \n\nsubsequently affect the uptake of metals (Wang and Rainbow, 2005). Over the last few \n\ndecades, numerous studies have been carried out on the uptake and bioaccumulation of \n\ntrace metals by aquatic animals (Hamelink et al., 1994; Turner and Tessier, 1995). The \n\nbioaccumulation of trace metals depends on the physiological accumulation pattern of \n\nthe species for each metal. If organisms with accumulation patterns with increasing \n\ndependence on storage accumulation follow sequentially along a food chain, the effect \n\nwill mimic biomagnification of trace metals along food chains (Amiard-Triquet et al., \n\n1993; Wang, 2002). \n\nThe different bioaccumulation strategies go from a high accumulation and weak \n\ndepuration to weak accumulation and a high depuration. The subsequent fate of the \n\nelement depends on the particular physiology of the organism, as to whether the metal is \n\nused for an essential metabolic purpose, stored in the body, excreted, or even gains \n\naccess to the \u201cwrong\u201d biomolecule (Rainbow, 2002).  \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651305000151#bib1\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651305000151#bib36\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651305000151#bib89\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 29 \n\n \n\nFigure I.2 \u2013 Accumulation and elimination of metals by organisms (Adapted from Connel and \n\nMiller, 1984). \n\n \n\nI.4.3. Detoxification \n\nAquatic organisms have the ability to accumulate high levels of essential and \n\nnon-essential metals, and therefore they need to develop effective detoxification \n\nsystems (Finger and Smith, 1987; Bebianno and Serafim, 1998). Once exposure has \n\noccurred and substances are bioavailable, a sequence of biological responses may take \n\nplace. Intrinsic (e.g. sex, age, health and nutritional status) and extrinsic (e.g. duration, \n\ndose, route of exposure to the contaminant and the presence of other chemicals) factors \n\nmay influence the health of the organisms even when they are exposed to trace elements \n\nat undesirable concentrations (Van der Oost et al., 2003). Trace metals in excess are \n\npotentially toxic and should be removed from the vicinity of important biological \n\nmolecules to maintain the regular function of cells. Subcellular metal partitioning is the \n\nbasis of internal metal sequestration over different organs and tissues, depending upon \n\nmany factors such as metal type and metal pre-exposure (Vijver et al., 2004). Indeed, it \n\nis generally accepted that toxicity will manifest itself at the subcellular level before it is \n\nobserved at higher levels of biological organisation (Cajaraville et al., 2000).  \n\nAquatic organisms have evolved a number of subcellular systems for \n\naccumulation, regulation and detoxification of the excess of essential and non-essential \n\nmetals, which allowed aquatic organisms to survive within environments containing \n\ntoxic metals (Bebianno, 1990; Bebianno and Serafim, 1998; Isani et al., 2000). \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X10002092#bib17\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 30 \n\nCurrently, metals are generally fractionated into 5 operationally defined subcellular \n\npools, consisting of metal-rich granules (MRG), cellular debris (mainly cellular \n\nmembrane fragments), organelles (metals bound with mitochondria, lysosomes, \n\nendoplasmic reticulum), heat shock proteins (HSP, including enzymes), high-molecular-\n\nweight ligands (HMW, such as metalloenzymes), low-molecular-weight ligands (LMW, \n\ne.g. glutathione) and heat-resistant proteins (generally considered to be metallothioneins \n\n(MTs) or more correctly metallothionein-like proteins MTLP) (Wallace et al., 2003). \n\nOverall, systems at subcellular level may be activated in order to prevent harmful \n\neffects. The onset of toxicity can happen at any total body concentration if the uptake \n\nrate changes such that it exceeds the combined rates of excretion and detoxification for \n\nsufficient time for the concentration of metabolically available metal to exceed a \n\nthreshold (Rainbow, 2007). \n\nOne of the best studied subcellular structures are the MTs, low-molecular-weight-rich-\n\nproteins, metal-binding protein rich in sulphur groups, with high affinity for group B \n\nmetal ions (e.g. Zn, Cu, Cd and Hg) (OSPAR commission, 2013). MTs are found in all \n\nvertebrates and most invertebrates, being identified in approximately 50 different \n\nspecies of aquatic invertebrates, the majority of which are molluscs or crustaceans. \n\nMost forms of MTs are involved in metal-sequestration, thereby possibly: regulating \n\ncellular processes requiring Zn and/or Cu; and binding and thus temporarily detoxifying \n\nnon-essential elements such as Cd and Hg. In addition, MT has been suggested to be \n\ninvolved in the cellular defense against free radicals (mainly due to the large number of \n\nSH-groups) (OSPAR commission, 2013). Consequently, they have become of great \n\ninterest for assessing pollution in the marine environment and are seen as potential \n\nbiomarkers of metal exposure in molluscs and fish (Langston et al., 1998). Trace metals \n\ncan induce MTs (Bebiano et al., 1993; Bebianno and Serafim, 1998; Lueng and \n\nFurness, 2001; Shi and Wang, 2005), which are involved in cellular regulation \n\n(homeostasis) and detoxification of these metals (Bebiano and Langston, 1998; \n\nRoesijadi et al., 1998; Viarengo et al., 1998; Wang and Rainbow, 2005; Amiard et al., \n\n2006). In marine fish species, MT concentration in tissues has been found to be most \n\nstrongly associated with Zn and Cu levels, although Cd may also result in minor \n\nincreases in areas with metal stress (Hylland et al., 2006). The fact that aquatic \n\norganisms have the capacity to synthesize these MTs that can sequester and \n\nsubsequently detoxify metals implies that the increased body burden of metals will not \n\nnecessarily result in increased toxic effects (Di Giulio et al., 1995).  \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 31 \n\nAquatic organisms utilize a variety of mechanism to eliminate metals. The kinetic of \n\nmetal release is complex and reflects the diverse compartments from which metals must \n\nbe mobilized. Additionally, physical and chemical parameters, such as temperature and \n\nsalinity, may affect the rate of release in aquatic organisms, which can use several \n\npathways to release metals: renal, digestive or diapedesis (in molluscs) (Kowalshi, \n\n2009). Salinity is one of the environmental factors that can have a wide variety of \n\neffects on the chemical speciation of river-borne trace metals such as desorption of \n\nparticle-bound metals, organic complexation and removal of trace metals from solution \n\n(Li et al., 1984). \n\n \n\nI.5. General characterization of Sepia officinalis (common cuttlefish) \n\nI.5.1. Taxonomic position \n\nAccording to Sweeney and Roper (1998), the taxonomic position of Sepia officinalis \n\n (Figure I.3) is: \n\nPhylum MOLLUSCA Linnaeus, 1758 \n\nClass CEPHALOPODA Cuvier, 1797 \n\nSubclass COLEOIDEA Bather, 1888 \n\nOrder SEPIIDA Zittel, 1895 \n\nFamily SEPIIDAE Leach, 1817 \n\nGenus Sepia Linnaeus, 1758 \n\nSpecie Sepia officinalis Linnaeus, 1758 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I.3 \u2013 Dorsal view of Sepia officinalis. \n\nCommon names: Choco (Portugal), Cuttlefish (UK, USA), Rellema or Choco (Spain), \n\nSepia or Seccia (Italy) and Seiche (France). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 32 \n\nI.5.2. World distribution  \n\nThe common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis Linnaeus, 1758, is one of the world's \n\nbest known cephalopods. The specie presents a wide distribution (Figure I.4), is found \n\nin eastern Atlantic shelf waters (Nixon and Mangold, 1998), from southern Norway to \n\nsouth Mediterranean sea (Roper et al., 1984), and in the north Africa until Cap Blanc \n\n(Boletzky, 1983; Kromov et al., 1998). Further south in African coast Sepia officinalis \n\nis replaced by the subspecie Sepia officinalis hierreda (Guerra, 1987; Guerra et al., \n\n2001). Common cuttlefish is absent from American coast (Roper et al., 1984; Guerra, \n\n1987; Nash and Thorpe, 2003). In Portugal, cuttlefish is common among all Portuguese \n\ncoast (Roper et al., 1984), however it is more abundant on west coast, at south of the \n\nTagus river and in Algarve Coast (south Portugal) (Brito, 1998). There are \n\napproximately 100 species in the genus Sepia, in Europe\u2019s coastal waters (Roper et al., \n\n1984; Pierce et al., 2010). In the same area of distribution also exists, Sepia elegans and \n\nSepia orbignyana, species from the same genus of Sepia officinalis (Guerra, 1987; \n\nPierce et al., 2010). Within these areas the specie lives in coastal waters and on \n\ncontinental shelf (Boletzky, 1983) (Figure I.4). These species of the continental shelf \n\ncomprise only about 15% of all the cephalopods and live in waters with less than 300 m \n\ndepth, which covers 6% of the Earth\u2019s surface (Clarke, 1996). \n\n \n\nFigure I.4 - Geographical distribution of Sepia officinalis (in pink) and Sepia officinalis hierredda \n\n(in violet) (Adapted from Okutani, 2005). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 33 \n\nI.5.3. Morphological characteristics \n\nThe diagnostic characteristics of Sepia sp. genus are: size; number and \n\narrangement of suckers in the tentacle club, as well as the sepion (cuttlebone) shape \n\n(Roper et al., 1984). According to Guerra (1992), the specie Sepia officinalis is distinct \n\nfrom others of the same genus by the following features: \n\na) Body is broad and flattened, and is therefore oval in cross-section; \n\nb) Shape of the internal, porous and calcareous shell know as cuttlebone or sepion; \n\nc) Projection of the mantle over the head forming an obtuse angle; \n\nd) Encircling the mouth there are ten appendices: eight arms with suckers, used to \n\nmanipulate prey, and two tentacles with flattened paddle-like tips, used to catch \n\nprey; \n\ne) tentacles are retractable into bags located on both sides of the head; \n\nf) Arms are short and possess 4 rows of suckers, with chitinous rings while \n\ntentacular clubs possess 5-6 suckers in transverse rows, where the median \n\nsuckers are moderately enlarged; \n\ng) In males the left arm IV is hectocotylized where the normal-sized suckers are \n\nreplaced by a series of minute suckers scattered over a large area of transverse \n\nfolds, the hectocotylus. \n\nMantle of common cuttlefish reaches a maximum length of 45 cm. In terms of weight, \n\ncuttlefish can reach up to 4 kg in temperate waters, not reaching more than 30 cm, and 2 \n\nKg in subtropical waters (Ropert et al., 1984). \n\nCuttlefish are one of few animal groups with the ability to camouflage themselves on a \n\nwide variety of backgrounds, from open sandy plains to complex coral and rock reef \n\nhabitats (Barbosa et al., 2008; Hanlon and Messenger, 1988). Camouflage is the \n\nprimary defence in cuttlefish (Chiao et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nI.5.4. Ecology \n\nSepia officinalis is a necto-benthic specie occurring predominantly on sandy and muddy \n\nbottoms from the intertidal zone to approximately 200m depth, with the highest \n\nabundance in the upper 100 m (OSPAR, 2000; Norman, 2000). Although excellent \n\nswimmers, they generally are bottom dwellers (Roper et al., 1984). \n\nCuttlefish can live in a range of salinity between 20 and 38 (Guerra and Castro, 1988). \n\nIn aquaculture, both embryonic development and growth of young cuttlefish, usually \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698911003397#b0015\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698911003397#b0075\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698909001308\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 34 \n\noccurs between 36 to 37 (Domingues et al., 2001a; Domingues et al., 2004a; Baeza-\n\nRojano et al., 2010). The range of temperature tolerated by cuttlefish is 10\u00baC to 30\u00baC. \n\nAt temperatures below 10\u00baC the individuals do not feed, stay inactive and die after a \n\ncouple of days (Richard, 1971; Bettencourt, 2000). Due to its capacity to adapt to a \n\nlarge range of these external parameters (temperature and salinity), the occurrence of \n\nthis species is frequent in coastal lagoons, where cuttlefishs are exposed to unstable \n\nhydrological conditions, along the year (Palmegiano and D\u2019Apote, 1983; Guerra et al., \n\n1988; Serrano, 1992; Guerra, 2006).  \n\nThe calcified shell of S. officinalis is internal and assists the animal in locomotion by \n\nfacilitating buoyancy (Bassaglia et al., 2013). Experiments with cuttlefish showed that \n\ncuttlebone of large animals implode between 150 m to 200 m, whereas advanced \n\nembryonic specimens and newly hatched implode between 50 m to 100 m. The larger \n\nindividuals are occasionally caught at depths greater than the implosion depth of \n\njuveniles shell parts. They apparently avoid the implosion of the early shell portions by \n\nrefilling these first-formed chambers with cameral liquid later in life (Ward and \n\nBoletzky, 1984).  \n\nCaptive-raised experiments showed that behaviour of cuttlefish was intensely affected \n\nby housing conditions and suggested that this specie is probably semi-solitary under \n\nnatural conditions (Boal et al., 1999). Domingues et al. (2003) revealed that S. \n\nofficinalis cultured in isolation conditions had higher growth and survival rates than the \n\nones maintained at relatively high densities, even when stressed. The authors observed \n\nagonistic behaviour related with competition for space with higher densities in tanks, \n\nindicating that density, or lack of space, appear to be more limiting than isolation. \n\n \n\nI.5.5. Reproductive traits  \n\nFertility in Sepia officinalis varies typically between 200 and 3000 eggs per female \n\n(Boletzky, 1988). Sexual maturation is conditioned by temperature and light. High \n\ntemperatures improve the sexual maturation and light acts in the optical glandular \n\nsystem (weak light accelerates the process). Males reach sexual maturity earlier than \n\nfemales (Richard, 1971; Boletzky, 1983; Guerra and Castro, 1988), and in both genders \n\nthe sexual maturation does not depend on the size of the individual (Boletzky, 1983). \n\nDuring reproduction season, males protect the females, and become more aggressive, \n\nattacking everything or everyone approaching (Richard, 1971). \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 35 \n\nCuttlefish is migratory specie of coastal waters that enters shallow coastal ecosystems \n\nfor reproduction. Spawning generally takes place in coastal waters in depths rarely \n\nabove the 30 to 40 m (Boletzky, 1983; Boucaud-Camou and Boismery, 1991). The life \n\ncycle and biology of this species are well known in several areas, as northwest \n\nMediterranean (Mangold, 1966), English Channel (Richard, 1971), Sea Catalonia \n\n(Mangold-wirz, 1963), Ria de Vigo (Guerra and Castro, 1988) and Ria Formosa \n\n(Coelho and Martins, 1989; Martins, 1990). However, since the majority of the studies \n\non Sepia officinalis have been based on laboratory-reared individuals under controlled \n\nconditions, some aspects of its ecology may remain unknown. Therefore there is the \n\nneed of extending the knowledge of this specie to other areas of its distributional range, \n\nlike northwest of Portugal. The main spawning season covers spring and summer, but \n\nthere is also winter spawning, which is especially pronounced on the Atlantic coast \n\n(Pierce et al., 2010). \n\nIn its natural environment, eggs are laid near the coast in spring. Particularly in the \n\nEnglish Channel and Atlantic Ocean, they may be exposed to air and/or desalinated \n\nrainwater due to daily tides. Eggs are attached in batches and surrounded by thick black \n\ngelatinous envelopes (capsule) potentially protecting the embryo from environmental \n\naggressions (Bassaglia et al., 2013). The eggs sizes usually range between 8 to 10 mm \n\nof diameter and are fixated in the shape of a bunch to algae, shells or other substrates \n\n(Boletzky, 1983; Roper et al., 1984). Larvae hatch as tiny replicas of adults assuming \n\nalso their behaviour, namely the benthonic way of life (Boletzky, 1983). \n\nThe mantle length of young individuals varies between 8 and 9 mm (Boletzky, 1979). \n\nTemperature influences the growing rate of individuals, which increases with the \n\ntemperature, and the same trend is verified with the food availability (Richard, 1971). \n\nCuttlefish has one of most complex nervous systems of all invertebrates. The \n\nconnection between the brain cortex and the optical lobes is particularly developed \n\n(Boucaud-Camou, 1990).  \n\nAs several other cephalopod species, S. officinalis has an extremely high growth ratio, \n\nand his life span does not exceed two years. Females undergo just one reproduction \n\nround and die shortly after (Bassaglia et al., 2013). Cephalopods are the unique \n\nmulticellular species with an exponential growth during a significant part of its life \n\ncycle (Monteiro et al., 1992). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 36 \n\nI.5.6. Trophic Ecology \n\nIn general, cephalopods are active carnivores that feed on living preys during their \n\nentire life cycle (Boucher-Rodoni et al., 1987). The diet of S. officinalis includes a wide \n\nvariety of prey, like fishes, crustaceans, molluscs, polychaetes, bivalves, nemertean \n\nworms, gastropods (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985, Castro and Guerra, 1989, Pinczon du \n\nSel, 1992, Pinczon du Sel et al., 2000; Domingues et al., 2004b, Alves, 2006). Species \n\ncomposition within these prey groups depends upon the respective species composition \n\nand availability in each ecosystem. Large cuttlefish are also cannibals, capturing and \n\neating smaller individuals (Richard, 1971; Castro and Guerra, 1990; Pinczon du Sel and \n\nDaguzan, 1992). Considering the wide variety of preys eaten by cuttlefish, this specie \n\nshould be considered as trophic opportunistic animal (Alves, 2006). Over age there is a \n\nprogressive replacement of prey, e.g. crustaceans by fishes (Castro and Guerra, 1990), \n\nthis ontogenetic changes are also related with prey size (Blanc et al, 1999; Blanc and \n\nDaguzan, 2000). In terms of sex, S. officinalis presented a similar composition of the \n\ndiet for males and females (Guerra and S\u00e1nchez, 1985). Castro and Guerra (1990) \n\nobserved that with the sexual maturation the feeding intensity of females increased. The \n\nvariety of preys decreased with the increase of length (Castro and Guerra, 1990).  \n\nPredators of Sepia officinalis are marine mammals (Risso\u00b4s dolphin, Mediterranean \n\nmonk seal and fur seals) and also, elasmobranchs (blue shark, smooth hound) (Pierce et \n\nal., 2010). \n\n \n\nI.5.7. Commercial importance, fisheries and aquaculture  \n\nThe total global capture production in 2011 was the third ever, slightly below 1996 \n\n(93.8 million tons) and 2000 (93.5 million tons). Molluscs contributed with 767,021 \n\ntons in 2010 and 738,729 tons in 2011, and a slight reduction of 3.7% from 2011 to \n\n2010 was observed (FAO, 2013). Global landings of cephalopods (cuttlefish, squid and \n\noctopus) have increased dramatically over the past 50 years and now constitute almost \n\n5% of the total world\u2019s fisheries production (Pierce et al., 2010). The main reason for \n\nthis increasing demand is that cephalopods are a good protein and lipid source (Kreuzer, \n\n1984; Sinanoglou and Miniadis-Meimaroglou, 1998; Sinanoglou and Miniadis-\n\nMeimaroglou, 2000; Zlatanos et al., 2006), therefore a highly nutritious food that \n\nrepresents an alternative to over exploited fish resources (Sykes, 2009). \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002364380800131X#bib39\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002364380800131X#bib39\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002364380800131X#bib61\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002364380800131X#bib62\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002364380800131X#bib62\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002364380800131X#bib72\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 37 \n\nFor cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis the FAO department of statistics presents the evolution \n\nof total landings of the specie, since 1950 until 2011 (Figure I.5). Since 1980 the \n\nlandings of cuttlefish exceeded 100 000 t and were more than 116 000 t in 2006 (FAO \n\nstatistic), comprising 49 000 t landed into Europe from the Northeast Atlantic and 67 \n\n000 t from Mediterranean. At the European scale, cuttlefish is currently the most \n\nimportant cephalopod fishery resource (Pierce et al., 2010) and is presently the highest \n\nyielding cephalopod group harvested in the north-east Atlantic, with the English \n\nChannel supporting the main fishery for this species (Bloor et al., 2013).  \n\nCatches are made demersally by means of trawling and artisanal trapping. Trammel nets \n\nare widely used in most southern European countries for the exploitation of common \n\ncuttlefish. These traditional fisheries are seasonal and are related to the massive inshore \n\nspawning migration of S. officinalis (Pierce et al., 2010). The operation of these nets to \n\ncatch cuttlefish usually extends from late winter to early autumn, depending on the \n\navailability of the resource as well as the seasonal abundance of other commercial \n\nspecies (e.g. shrimp, sole) that are also targeted on inshore fishing grounds (Arn\u00e1iz et \n\nal., 2001; Lefkaditou et al., 2004). Traps are the dominant gear for the capture of \n\ncuttlefish in south Portugal, Algarve coast (Carneiro et al., 2006).   \n\n \n\nFigure I.5 - Total landings (tones) of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in world since 1950 to 2011 \n\n(FAO statistics, 2013).  \n\nIn Portugal, the Aveiro region has a key role in the Portuguese fisheries market, \n\ncontributing with 10,695 t of fish, crustaceans and mollusks (DGPA, 2010). Cuttlefish \n\nis caught along the entire Portuguese coast being considered as an important fishery \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 38 \n\nresource (Serrano, 1992). Local fishermen, in Ria the Aveiro, use trammel nets to \n\ncapture cuttlefish (Jorge and Sobral, 2004). Despite being a seasonal fishery, cuttlefish \n\nlandings in Aveiro Lagoon are very important to the local economy. Figure I.6 shows \n\nthe total landings of cuttlefish between 2002 and 2012 and the annual turnover of those \n\nlandings.  \n\nAlong the years, landings of cuttlefish fluctuate from higher to lower catches, and this \n\nfact is certainly related with changes in environmental conditions and with the \n\nrecruitment. Modelling and understanding cuttlefish exploitation is a challenge for a \n\nseries of reasons: life-cycle and population dynamics are different from those of finfish \n\n(Caddy, 1983; Boyle and Boletzky, 1996). Recruitment, the renewal of harvestable \n\nstages in a population, is a key parameter of stock dynamics, and recruitment variability \n\nis often considered as the most difficult problem in stock assessment (Hilborn and \n\nWalters, 1992 in Challier et al. 2002). In Cephalopods, the short life span makes \n\ncommercial catches more dependent on the number of recruits than in most teleost fish \n\n(Challier et al., 2002). Early life stages are likely to incur higher mortalities than adult \n\nstages (Caddy, 1996), and are generally described as extremely responsive to \n\nenvironmental variables. Their population show wide fluctuations of abundance (Boyle \n\nand Boletzky, 1996), largely because they usually grow rapidly to maturity, they carry \n\nfew food reserves (Rodhouse and Nigmatullin, 1996), have little overlap of generations \n\nand their migratory patterns make them particularly susceptible to chances in \n\noceanographic conditions (Clarke, 1996). On the other hand, they show great resilience \n\nto fluctuations by their breeding seasons, varying the depth of their spawning grounds \n\nand maintaining complex recruitment patterns (Boyle and Boletzky, 1996).  \n\nDespite being seasonal, cuttlefish landings in the Ria de Aveiro are very important for \n\nthe local economy (Figure I.6). In 2010, the annual turnover was more than 1.5 million \n\nEuros. Between 2002 and 2012 the average turnover was 846 thousand euros, and the \n\naverage price for 1 Kg varied between 2.43 \u20ac and 3.72 \u20ac in 2004 and 2012, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 39 \n\n \n\nFigure I.6 - Total landings of cuttlefish in Aveiro Lagoon by tones captured (bars) and Annual \n\nturnover per year (line). (Docapesca - Statistical Department, 2013). \n\nThe high commercial value of cephalopods and their characteristics: short life cycles, \n\nfast growth rates and high food conversion, makes the aquaculture of this group of \n\nmolluscs an area of increasing interest (Boletzky, 1983; Domingues et al., 2001a; Pierce \n\net al., 2010). The cuttlefish, S. officinalis, is an economically important species and \n\ntherefore interesting to aquaculture (Pierce et al., 2010). Sepia officinalis is one of the \n\nmost easily cultured cephalopods, and has been cultured in aquaria since the late 1960s \n\n(Richard, 1971; Pascual, 1978; Boletzky and Hanlon, 1983; Forsythe et al., 1994; Lee et \n\nal., 1998; Domingues et al., 2001a, 2001b, 2002, 2003, 2004a; Quintana et al., 2005; \n\nSykes et al., 2006; Baeza-Rojano et al., 2010). Aquaculture of cephalopods represents \n\nan alternative to over exploited fish resources, thus the increasing development in this \n\narea (Sykes, 2009). \n\n \n\nI.6. Ria de Aveiro \u2013 a case study \n\nAccording to INE (2011) the number of inhabitants surrounding the entire watershed is \n\napproximately one million people. Ria de Aveiro has an important environmental role in \n\nlocal and surrounding areas due to its variety of resources and uses such as fishing (sea-\n\nbass, eel, sole, flounder, lamprey, cuttlefish, crab, shrimp and cockle), aquaculture \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 40 \n\n(mainly, sea-bass, eel, oyster and clam), recreational (windsurfing, boating, sailing and \n\nswimming) and traditional activities (salt production). Agriculture and cattle rearing, \n\nindustries (chemical, metallurgic, ceramics, tannery and pulp miling), urban \n\ndevelopment and port activities increased significantly over years in the area around the \n\nlagoon (Abreu et al., 1998; Pastorinho et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nI.6.1. Morphologic and hydrological features  \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal lagoon located in the North-western of Portugal. It \n\npresents a very complex geometry and is characterized by large areas of intertidal flats \n\nand a web of narrow channels (Dias and Picado, 2011). The Ria de Aveiro lagoon \n\nconstitutes a very important area, being the most extensive shallow lagoon system in \n\nPortugal and the most dynamic in terms of physical and biogeochemical processes \n\n(Picado et al., 2010). The lagoon covers an area of 83 km\n2\n at high tide (spring tide) and \n\n66 km\n2\n at low tide, is 45 km long, 10 km wide and is connected to sea by a 350 m wide \n\ninlet, fixed by two jetties (Dias and Lopes, 2006). Connection to the sea was made \n\nartificially since 1808 (Pombo, 2005). Four main branches radiate from this sea \n\nentrance: Mira, S. Jacinto, \u00cdlhavo and Espinheiro channels (Dias, 2009). This system is \n\nalso characterized by a large number of other smaller channels between which lie \n\nsignificant intertidal areas, essentially mudflats, salt marshes and old salt pans (Picado \n\net al., 2010). The average depth of the lagoon relative to mean sea level is about 3 m \n\n(Picado et al., 2010). The evolution process lasted for 800 years and occurred through \n\nthe deposition of sand, with the formation of coastal sand dunes and a system of islands \n\nwithin the lagoon, this process was interrupted in the 18\nth\n\n century by human action \n\n(Silva, 2000). \n\nThe major factors that control the hydrologic dynamics of the Ria de Aveiro are: \n\na) Oceanic tide, which propagates from south to north along the west coast \n\nPortugal, entering in the lagoon by its mouth; \n\nb) Winter that influences the lagoon for short periods and essentially in the wider \n\npart of the Ria de Aveiro; \n\nc) Freshwater flows, transported by four major rivers that converge to the Ria: \n\nVouga and Antu\u00e3 from the East; Caster from the North and Boco from the \n\nSoutheast (Dias et al., 2001); \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771413001832#bib20\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771413001832#bib17\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771413001832#bib54\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771413001832#bib54\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771413001832#bib54\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 41 \n\nd) Wave regimes of north Atlantic also affect the morphodynamic of the Ria de \n\nAveiro (Dias, 2009). \n\n \n\nI.6.2. Contamination in Ria de Aveiro \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro is highly explored and impacted by anthropogenic activities, with \n\nsignificant and diverse sources of aquatic contaminants due to population settlement, \n\nindustrial, agricultural and shipping activities (e.g. Pacheco et al., 2005; Vasconcelos et \n\nal., 2007; Pastorinho et al., 2012). The contamination pathways from anthropogenic \n\nsources, in the Ria de Aveiro, have been extensively documented (e.g. Monterroso et \n\nal., 2003a; Ramalhosa et al., 2006). Several works conducted in the Ria de Aveiro \n\nsystem, in northern Portugal, revealed high levels of several metals (Hg, Cu, Cd, Zn, \n\nPb) (Borrego et al., 1994; Martins, 2010; Monterroso et al., 2003a; Pereira, 2003; \n\nNunes et al., 2008; Pastorinho et al., 2012).  \n\nDespite all the activities mentioned above the principal source of anthropogenic \n\ncontamination in Ria de Aveiro is the chlor-alkali plant located in Estarreja, that started \n\nits activity in early decade of 1950 and presented different stages and phases of \n\nproduction increments (Pereira, 1997; OSPAR, 2005) and being responsible for the \n\nmain Portuguese chlor and caustic production (OSPAR, 2005). As many studies show \n\n(e.g. Lacerda and Salomons, 1998 and Ullrich et al., 2007) mercury-cell chlor-alkali \n\nplants have been identified as main sources of mercury to the environment. Though the \n\nplant started to change the production process in 1994 and completely ceased the use of \n\nmercury in 2002 (Ospar Commission, 2006). Mercury emitted from the existing plant \n\nstill remains significant in the surrounding environment. Additionally, it is known that \n\nthrough the years, large amounts of mercury have reached Ria de Aveiro, a nearby \n\ncoastal lagoon, due to wastewater discharges (Reis, 2009) and a large number of \n\nabandoned mines draining to the Vouga River or its tributaries (Delgado et al., 2000). \n\nDue to high levels of mercury found in Ria de Aveiro, this coastal lagoon and its \n\nenvirons have been extensively studied, with particular focus on sediments (Lucas et al., \n\n1986; Hall et al., 1985; Pereira et al., 1998; Pereira, 1997; Ramalhosa et al., 2001, \n\n2005, 2006; Ramalhosa et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2009; Pastorinho et al., 2012), \n\nplankton (Monterroso et al., 2003b), estuarine macroalgae (Coelho et al., 2005) and \n\naquatic organisms (Coelho et al., 2006; V\u00e1lega et al., 2006; Nunes et al., 2008; Cardoso \n\net al., 2013). An effort has been made to monitor species with economic importance, \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X11000257#bib0240\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X11000257#bib0300\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X11000257#bib0300\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651311002636#bib8\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651311002636#bib41\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651311002636#bib42\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib22\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib43\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib32\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib11\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib46\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 42 \n\nboth invertebrate (Coelho et al., 2006; Coelho et al., 2007; Pereira et al., 2006; Pereira \n\net al., 2009; Ahmad, 2012; Nilin et al., 2012) and vertebrate species (Abreu et al., \n\n2000). \n\n \n\nI.7. Aims and Organization of the Thesis \n\nThe main objective of the present thesis was to characterize (biology, ecology, life \n\ncycle, diet and metal contamination) the cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, in Ria de Aveiro, a \n\nresource of high importance and a current item of the humans\u2019 diet. In this thesis we \n\npretended to answer to several questions such as: What is the distribution of cuttlefish in \n\nRia de Aveiro? Which environmental factors affect the cuttlefish distribution in the Ria \n\nde Aveiro? Which is the spawning season of Sepia officinalis in the Ria de Aveiro? \n\nWhat are the feeding preferences of Sepia officinalis in the Ria de Aveiro? Is the diet of \n\ncuttlefish affected by season or sampling station? Sepia officinalis can accumulate \n\nmetals in their tissues, and considering that Ria de Aveiro is a coastal ecosystem with a \n\nhistory of contamination, does the cuttlefish represents any risk for human health? What \n\nfactors affected metal contamination in Sepia officinalis in Ria de Aveiro? To answer to \n\nthese questions and others, several biological and ecological data was collected in Ria \n\nde Aveiro during this work. The choice of tissues analysed were selected according to \n\nprevious studies (Miramand and Bentley, 1992) and the choice of sampling areas within \n\nthe Ria de Aveiro were selected according to previous studies of ecology (Pombo and \n\nRebelo, 2000) and ecotoxicology (Pereira et al., 1998; Monterroso et al., 2003a). \n\nThe present thesis is organized in seven chapters. Each chapter can be summarized as \n\nfollows: \n\n? Chapter I: provides a theoretical introduction regarding aspects of contamination \n\nin aquatic ecosystems and in the studied area, and the characterization of Sepia \n\nofficinalis; \n\n? Chapter II: reviews the available bibliography concerning the biological, life \n\ncycle and ecological data about Sepia officinalis and makes a comprehensive \n\nstudy of this issues in Ria de Aveiro; \n\n? Chapter III: describes the concentrations of essential metals (Fe, Zn, Cu) and \n\nnon-essential (Cd and Pb) in mantle and digestive gland of Sepia officinalis in \n\nRia de Aveiro and evaluates the seasonal and spatial trends of this accumulation. \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib11\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib34\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib1\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708011194#bib1\n\n\nChapter I \n\n| P a g e 43 \n\nIt is also compared the obtained values with others European aquatic ecosystems \n\nand one in New Caledonia waters. \n\n?

Ecology and life cycle of common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis in a typical \n\nestuarine lagoon \n\n \n\nII.1. Abstract \n\nThe cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) is one of the most important fisheries in Ria de Aveiro. \n\nTemporal and spatial distribution patterns and the reproductive cycle of this specie were \n\nstudied monthly in ten sampling areas along the lagoon from July 2001 to December \n\n2003. The highest abundance was obtained in summer, while spring showed the higher \n\nbiomass but a much lower abundance of specimens. Mature individuals prevailed in the \n\neastern zone of the lagoon during summer while juveniles were dominant in autumn and \n\nwinter. Almost all individuals leave the lagoon during winter. The reproduction season \n\nbegan in spring and continued during summer, the data did not reveal the existence of a \n\nsecond reproductive cycle in the autumn and winter. Weight\u2013length relationship \n\nrevealed significant differences between sexes, for lengths higher than 82.4 mm females \n\nwere larger than males. A sex ratio of 1:1 was presented in this studied. The length at \n\nfirst maturity was estimated at 146.9 \u00b1 0.8 mm dorsal mantle length (DML) for females \n\nand 91.4 \u00b1 0.9 mm DML for males, and it was verified that males mature earlier than \n\nfemales. In Ria de Aveiro only one generation of cuttlefish breeders were found and all \n\nthe individuals were in their first year of life. In terms of trophic ecology, the cuttlefish \n\nis an opportunistic feeder, consuming several preys of different taxa. Diet was not \n\ndifferent between selected sites, however reveled differences between seasons and \n\npreys. The preferred prey for Sepia officinalis were the group of Portunidae, and the \n\nspecies Crangon crangon, Carcinus maenas and Pomatoschistus microps were \n\nsecondary preys. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 68 \n\nII.2. Introduction  \n\nLike other cephalopods, Sepia officinalis reproduces only once over a short period at the \n\nend of its life (Mangold, 1983). The main stages of its life are punctuated by important \n\nseasonal migrations between shallow waters in summer and deeper waters in the winter \n\n(Gauvrit et al., 1997). Cuttlefish live approximately two years and exhibits mass \n\nmortality of adults following spring spawning period (Boletzky, 1983). Although \n\ncuttlefish can exhibit variations in the life cycle, e.g. Domingues et al. (2002) referred \n\nthat some specimens can only reach 6 to 9 months of age. The duration of its life cycle \n\nis closely related to environmental factors, like the temperature of water (Domingues et \n\nal., 2002). Thus, in the northern part of their distribution area (English Channel), they \n\nreproduce during the second year of life, during a short breeding season of 2 to 3 \n\nmonths (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1991). In contrast, in Warmer waters such as those \n\naround the Iberian Peninsula, the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Tunis, the majority of \n\ncuttlefish reproduce at one year old and over a longer period (Coelho and Martins, \n\n1991; Guerra and Castro, 1988; Mangold, 1966).  \n\nDue to the seasonal migrations for reproduction, the cuttlefish is exposed to a wide \n\nrange of diets (Guerra, 2006). Several authors have studied the feeding habits of \n\ncuttlefish in northern Spain, France and Mediterranean (Najai and Ktari, 1979; Castro \n\nand Guerra, 1989, 1990; Pinczon du Sel and Daguzan, 1992; Blanc, 1998; Pinczon du \n\nSel et al., 2000; Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985). However, in Portugal studies about diet \n\nonly appears in south coast, Alves et al., (2006) in Algarve and Neves et al., (2009) in \n\nSado estuary. In the northern of Portugal, none published data about feeding habits in \n\nknown.  \n\nCephalopods have growth rates that can be higher than 10% body weight day\n-1\n\n \n\n(Domingues et al., 2001b). Since cephalopods are poikilothermic, temperature is the \n\nmost important factor affecting growth rates when food is abundant (Forsythe and Van \n\nHeukelen, 1987). Beyond the duration of life cycle and growth rates of cuttlefish, many \n\nothers characteristics of their life cycle are affected by temperature such as survival and \n\nfeeding rates, age and size maturation, embryonic development and hatchling survival \n\n(Boletzky, 1979; Boletzky and Hanlon, 1983).  \n\nSepia officinalis L., is one of the best known Cephalopods (Guerra and Castro, 1988). \n\nSeveral studies have been conducted on distribution (Gi Geon 1981; Boletzky, 1983; \n\nRoper et al., 1984; Kromov et al., 1998; Nixon and Mangold, 1998), biology (Ezzedine-\n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 69 \n\nNajal S. 1984; Guerra, 1992; Clarke, 1996; Norman, 2000), life cycle (Choe, 1966; \n\nBoletzky, 1979; Boletzky, 1983; Forsythe et al., 1994; Le Goeff and Daguzan, 1991; \n\nBouchaud, 1991; Nixon and Mangold, 1998; \u00d6nsoy B. and Salman A. 2005), \n\nmaturation (Bouchaud and Daguzan, 1989; Richard, 1971), aquaculture (Hanley et al., \n\n1998; Pascual, 1978), diet (Pinczon du Sel and Daguzan, 1992; Blanc et al., 1999; \n\nKoueta and Boucaud-Camou, 1999; Domingues et al., 2001a; Koueta et al.,2002) and \n\nexternal factors (Palmegiano and D\u2019apote, 1983; Bouchaud and Daguzan, 1990; \n\nDomingues et al., 2001b). However, in spite of its economic importance in the Ria de \n\nAveiro (Docapesca - Statistical Department, 2013), this species has not yet received \n\nconsistent scientific attention, the information \n\nis scarce and only one study by Jorge and \n\nSobral (2004) gave some information about \n\nspecies biology in Ria de Aveiro. \n\nThe aim of this research is to improve the \n\nknowledge on the population structure of \n\nSepia officinalis in Ria de Aveiro (abundance, \n\nbiomass (total weight), length, distribution of \n\nsex and maturity stages); to describe the diet \n\nof Sepia officinalis in Ria de Aveiro and the \n\nreproductive cycle of S. officinalis, in Ria de \n\nAveiro lagoon. \n\n \n\nII.3. Materials and methods \n\nII.3.1. Study Area \n\nRia de Aveiro is a coastal lagoon (Figure II.1), \n\nalso mentioned by others author as a \u2018\u2018bar-\n\nbuilt estuary\u2019\u2019 (Dias, 2001). It is located in the \n\nnorthwestern (40\u00ba38\u00b4N, 8\u00ba44\u00b4W) coast of \n\nPortugal. The system can be subdivided into \n\nchannels that, due to specific characteristics, \n\ncan be regarded as independent estuaries \n\nconnected to a common outlet. In general, the \n\nFigure II.1 - Sampling sites of S. \n\nofficinalis: Ria de Aveiro (Adapted \n\nfrom Valentim et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 70 \n\nmost common typology is one of extensive intertidal zones, namely mud flats and salt \n\nmarshes, with the exception of the central area of the lagoon (Pastorinho et al., 2012). \n\nSampling sites were selected based on a geographic distribution taking into account the \n\nwhole area of the lagoon. ARE, at the end of Mira channel (the Southern site); BAR \n\nnear the entrance of the lagoon; SJA near the entrance of the lagoon in the initial part of \n\nS. Jacinto channel; POR within the harbour; GAF situated in the vicinity of a deep-sea \n\nfishing port and dry-docks; TOR an intermediate region of the longest channel (S. \n\nJacinto-Ovar channel); RIO located in the terminal area of the main freshwater course, \n\nthe Vouga river; LAR in the proximity of the chlor-alkali plant (6 km); CAR located in \n\nthe terminal area of the S. Jacinto channel (the Northern site) and VAG located at the \n\nedge of \u00cdlhavo channel. \n\n \n\nII.3.2. Sampling and biological data collection \n\nSampling was made monthly, from July 2001 to December 2002 with bottom trawl and \n\nfrom March 2003 to December 2003 with a trammel network (Table II-I). In the years \n\nof 2001 and 2002, samples were collected in 10 sites of Ria de Aveiro (Figure II.1). The \n\nreason to use two different types of networks was the necessity of capturing cuttlefishes \n\nof all maturity stages, to have a representative structure of the population. A total of 295 \n\ncuttlefishes were captured. \n\n \n\nII.3.3. Abiotic parameters \n\nThe abiotic parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, turbidity \n\nand depth were registered on each capture. Temperature (\u00b1 0.1 \u00baC) and dissolved \n\noxygen (\u00b1 0.01 mg.l\n-1\n\n) were recorded with an oxygen meter (Consort Z621), the pH (\u00b1 \n\n0.01) with pH meter (WTW 330/set \u2013 2), the salinity (\u00b1 0.1) with a refractometer \n\n(Atago), the turbidity (\u00b1 0.1 m) was recorded with a Secchi disc and the depth (\u00b1 0.1m) \n\nwith a handmade probe (Table A. 1 - Appendix). \n\n \n\nII.3.4. Biological parameters \n\nDorsal mantle length (DML, size), total weight (Wt), the wet weight of the gonad (WG), \n\nand for females the wet weight of the nidamental glands, the sex and a maturity stage \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 71 \n\nwere determined in each individual. The number of individuals, mantle length and body \n\nweight of each site are given in Table II-I. \n\nTo determine the relationship between DML and Wt for males and females the \n\nparameters of the equation Wt = a DML\nb\n were estimated. A standard 5-point scale of \n\nsexual maturity for S. officinalis was used (adapted from Alonso-Allende and Guerra, \n\n1984), in which stage I is \u201cimmature\u201d, stage II is \u201cdeveloping\u201d, stage III is \u201dmaturing\u201d, \n\nand stage IV is \u201cripe\u201d. Specimens with no visible gonad development were classified as \n\n\u201cjuveniles\u201d (Challier et al., 2002) and allocated in maturity stage I. \n\n \n\nII.3.5. Trophic ecology parameters \n\nThe analysis of gut contents was made with use of binocular lens, by separating prey by \n\ntheir different taxa, and being the identification of their taxonomic level made according \n\nto the digestion level. \n\nThe prey\u00b4s identification was not made with the aim of reaching their specie, because it \n\nwas considered that such precision was not necessary, and they were only identified to \n\nthe lower taxonomic category possible. Other studies also suggest that it is not \n\nnecessary to reach the species according to the proposed objectives (Windell and \n\nBowen, 1978; Oliveira, 1997). Reaching the specie identification is a complex and time \n\nconsuming task that would not add significant information.  \n\nThe identified preys were counted by taxa for each gut. The counting process was a \n\ndifficult lengthy operation, as they were frequently disarticulated, and therefore it was \n\ndecided to choose fragments that existed individually on each prey of a certain tax, as \n\nthey might be considered diagnostic features. \n\nThe unidentified material was classified as detritus, and counted as a single item, by \n\neach structure were it was identified as proposed by Madenjian et al. (1996). The \n\ndifferent types of algae and marine angiospermae found, independently of the number \n\nof fragments, were counted as a unique feed component, being inserted as Vegetable. \n\nAfter their identification and counting by taxa, preys were preserved in 70% alcohol \n\n(ethanol) (Windell and Bowen, 1978). \n\nWet weight (WWt) was determined for the different preys by taxonomic group in a 4 \n\ndecimal places scale. Several authors use WWt instead of the dry weight (DWt), which \n\nis the most accurate measure to use in the weight coefficient (Cw %) (Hynes, 1950; \n\nWindell and Bowen, 1978) and it is known that both are strongly correlated (Glenn and \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 72 \n\nWard, 1968). Prior to the identification ash-free dry weight (AFDW) was obtained after \n\n24h in an oven at 60\u00baC.  \n\nDetritus were not used on later analysis, as performed by other authors (Caragitsou and \n\nPapaconstatinou, 1994; Capitolo et al., 1995). \n\nAll biologic characteristics obtained from the monthly sampling campaigns were \n\nrecorded as well as the ash-free dry weight (AFDW). \n\n \n\nII.3.6. Data analysis \n\nII.3.6.1. Abiotic data analysis \n\nPrincipal Component analysis (PCA) was performed, using the CANOCO software \n\npackage for Windows, version 4.5 (Ter Braak and Smilauer, 2002) to assess the \n\nvariability of abiotic parameters measured during the study period (2001-2003) in the \n\ndifferent sampling sites. \n\n \n\nII.3.6.2. Biological data analysis \n\nThe length at which 50% of cuttlefish were mature was determined for females and \n\nmales. The percentage of sexually mature individuals (PM), for each sex (maturity \n\nstages III and IV) caught during sampling were determined by fitting the following \n\nlogistic model:  \n\n   \n    \n\n         \n , where SFM is the size at first maturation. \n\nAn index of sexual development was calculated using the gonadosomatic index (GSI), \n\nwhich is defined as  \n\n    \n  \n\n       \n    , was estimated for season and maturity stage. \n\nThe sex-ratio was calculated for each season. Seasons were defined as follow: \n\nWinter = January \u2013 March. Spring = April \u2013 June \n\nSummer = July \u2013 September. Autumn = October \u2013 December. \n\nThe comparison of allometric relationships between males and females were tested \n\nusing ANCOVA (Zar, 1999). Redundancy Analysis (RDA), a technique that falls \n\nbetween multiple regression and canonical correlation analysis (Sparks et al., 1999), \n\nwas performed using the CANOCO software package for windows, version 4.5 to \n\nassess effects of biological factors on S. officinalis in the three years of sampling and in \n\nsites sampling. The significance of RDA was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 73 \n\ntest using routines built into the software package. A complete description of the \n\nmethod is provided in Van den Brink et al. (2003). Differences on the gonadosomatic \n\nindex (GSI) for seasons and sites were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test using \n\nMINITAB\u00ae Release 14.20. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all tests. The \n\ndeviations from 1:1 sex ratio were assessed using chi-square test by Sigmaplot 10. \n\n \n\nII.3.6.3. Diet analysis \n\n \n\nGut content analysis method \n\nTo analyse the gut contents three methods were used: \n\n Numeric method; \n\n Occurrence (or frequency) method; \n\n Gravimetric (or volumetric) method. \n\nThese methods can be complemented by other \u201cmixed\u201d methods (data interaction \n\nbetween two or more of the base methods referred), as well as indexes and additional \n\ninformation that could help on the diet characterization. \n\nThey produce accurate results, both at individual and conjugated level.  \n\n \n\nNumerical method (CN %) \n\nThe total number of individuals of a certain taxa is expresses as a percentage of the total \n\nnumber of preys (Hynes, 1950; Pillay, 1952; Hyslop, 1980; Bowen, 1983; Valente, \n\n1992): \n\n   \n \n\n \n     \n\nWhere n \u2013 total number of preys of a certain taxa; N \u2013 total number of preys. \n\nProblems associated with this method and their specific resolution was previously \n\nreferred in Materials and methods. \n\n \n\nGravimetric method (Cw %) \n\nThe weight estimation of each taxa (in fresh or dry) is calculated as a percentage of the \n\ntotal weight of the contents (Pillay, 1952; Hyslop, 1980; Bowen, 1983):  \n\n   \n \n\n \n     \n\nWhere w \u2013 total wet weight of the preys of a certain taxa; W \u2013 Wet weight of all preys. \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 74 \n\nGravimetric method gives a reasonable estimate of the preys weight, being easy to apply \n\nwhen residues are high (Valente, 1992) overvaluing the individual contribution of heavy \n\ntaxa (George and Hadley, 1979). \n\n \n\nOccurrence method \n\nIn this method, the number of individuals in which a determined item occurs is \n\nexpressed in terms of frequency of the total number of guts sampled (Hynes, 1950; \n\nPillay, 1952, 1983; Hyslop, 1980; Valente, 1992): \n\n   \n \n\n \n     \n\nWhere f \u2013 number of guts where a certain taxa is present; F \u2013 Total number of full guts \n\nobserved. \n\nThis method can be used as an interspecific competition indicator. If CF% exceeds 25% \n\nin two or more predators, competition is possible (Hyslop, 1980). It is also considered \n\nuseful on the determination of seasonal variations of diet composition (Frost, 1977; \n\nPedley and Jones, 1978), as food selectivity by the predator and as an availability index \n\nof a certain food (Herr\u00e1n, 1988). \n\n \n\nFeed coefficient (Q) \n\nThe feed coefficient, by combining more than one method, is considered a mixed \n\nmethod (Herr\u00e1n, 1988). Thus it allows a good analysis of the relative importance of \n\ndifferent preys of a certain animal, by taking into account their contribution in weight \n\nand number (Hureau, 1970):  \n\n            \n\nDepending on the Q value, three categories were defined (Hureau, 1970): \n\n Q<20 \u2013 Occasional preys; \n\n 20<Q<200 \u2013 Secondary preys; \n\n Q>200 \u2013 Preferential preys. \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nDifferences in AFDW of gut contents between sampling sites and the food types were \n\nassessed using the GLM module of Minitab 16 (Minitab Inc., 2010). Prior to the \n\nanalysis the data was check for normality and homoscedasticity using the Anderson \n\nDarling Test and the Levene test, respectively. To correct for deviations to normality \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 75 \n\nand heteroscedasticity AFDW was transformed using the log(X+1) transformation prior \n\nto further analysis. Specific size differences associated with the diet were assessed using \n\nthe eviscerated weight of the individuals as a covariate. Whenever significant \n\ndifferences associated with a given factor were found the Tukey post hoc test was \n\napplied to identify differences between levels. All statistical analysis was carried out for \n\na significance level of 0.05. \n\nTable II-I \u2013 Summary of key aspects related with the structure of cuttlefish populations (number \n\nof individuals (n), mantle length (mm) and total weight (g)) by year of capture. \n\n \n\n \n\nII.4. Results \n\nII.4.1. Abiotic parameters \n\nPCA analysis showed that most of the variability is associated with the first two axes \n\n(76.1%), and the rest of the axis only explained 23.9%. The PCA analysis of abiotic \n\nparameters within different years of capture in Ria de Aveiro (Figure II.2; a)) was made \n\nassuming the existence of annual variation. However, the analysis showed that the \n\ndifferences in abiotic parameters didn\u2019t lead to differences in between years. A good \n\noverlap of the three years of sampling was observed (Figure II.2; a)). Having this fact in \n\nmind, the analysis of three years of catches can be done together and the variation of \n\nabiotic parameters was not related to months but to sites of sampling (Figure II.2; b)). \n\nThe PCA analysis of abiotic parameters within different sites of capture in Ria de \n\nAveiro (Figure II.2; b)) showed that the main two factors that affected S. officinalis \n\n2001 2002 2003 2001 2002 2003 2001 2002 2003\n\nBAR 11 19 12 18.8 - 107.0 20.0 - 112.2 32.0 - 187.0 170.0 797.5 3170.4\n\nCAR 17 6 - 30.2 - 67.3 25.8 - 110.0 - 237.0 204.7 -\n\nGAF 14 34 5 31.1 - 67.2 15.3 - 172.0 91.0 - 187.0 322.0 1482.6 1497.8\n\nLAR 28 16 3 23.6 - 129.0 32.8 - 144.1 140.0 - 185.0 821.6 1177.5 1437.3\n\nRIO 19 11 3 15.6 - 148.6 16.0 - 106.4 108.0 - 113.0 688.8 246.5 586.0\n\nSJA 10 12 - 17.1 - 57.4 17.0 - 78.0 - 64.4 337.7 -\n\nTOR 19 16 8 26.7 - 115.6 35.8 - 85.6 105.0 - 185.0 434.6 444.2 3494.4\n\nPOR - - 25 - - 95.0 - 208.0 - - 14095.8\n\nVAG 3 4 - 32.1 - 53.2 39.9 - 125.4 - 49.2 395.3 -\n\nARE - - - - - - - - -\n\nTOTAL 121 118 56 15.6 - 148.6 15.3 - 172.0 32.0 - 208.0 2787.6 5086.0 24281.7\n\nSites\nn\n\nMantle lenght\n\n(mm)\n\nTotal weight\n\n(g)\n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 76 \n\nwere salinity and depths (Figure II.2; a) and b)).

Figure II.6 shows that the frequency of individuals caught by \n\nmantle length class, sampled with the same network (2001 and 2002), present a similar \n\nstructure distribution. This result was also verified with the RDA analysis along the \n\nyears of sampling, which presented no significant differences for sex, sites and maturity \n\nstages (p>0.05). In fact, when DML (mm) was removed from the analysis, the RDA \n\nrevealed no significant difference in the S. officinalis distribution between sex and \n\nmaturity stages (p>0.05), indicating that the difference was a consequence of network \n\ncaught.  \n\nThe highest abundance was registered in summer (225 individuals) and the lowest \n\nabundance was registered in winter (only, 3 individuals) (Figure II.7). The central part \n\nof the lagoon (near the mouth) was the most abundant in cuttlefish, while the most \n\nNortherly and Southerly sites presented the lowest abundance in this species. This fact \n\nis related to abiotic parameters (Figure II.2, b)), since sampling sites located within the \n\nlimits of the Ria de Aveiro showed the lowest values of salinity. The highest biomass \n\nvalues were recorded in spring and summer (13 and 18 Kg, respectively) and the highest \n\nvalue by sampling site was obtained in POR (14.1 Kg) (Figure II.7). \n\nSex a b r\n2\n\nN\n\nFemale 0.2014 2.8343 0.9728 64\n\nMale 0.2144 2.7741 0.9811 88\n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 80 \n\n \n\nFigure II.6 \u2013 Length frequency distribution of immature, male and female cuttlefish along years of \n\nsampling. \n\n \n\nThe abiotic parameters provide the colonization of the lagoon by cuttlefish practically \n\nthroughout all the year, although with marked fluctuations in abundance.

The analysis of the percentage of individuals \n\nper maturity stage along the three consecutive years of sampling (Figure II.8) showed \n\nthat: large cuttlefish, higher than 82.7 mm, enter the Ria in spring; during summer and \n\nautumn the smaller individuals (stage I and II) dominate, however the expression of \n\nmature individuals in summer is still very high; in winter the abundance of S. officinalis \n\nin the Ria is strongly reduced. This fact suggests that the development of the cuttlefish \n\nborn in Ria de Aveiro is mainly made offshore, what could justify the absence of \n\nmaturing individuals during the autumn (Figure II.8). The absence of mature specimens \n\nafter the spawning season (spring and summer) suggests that cuttlefish does not survive \n\nafter spawning (Figure II.8). The spawning occurs in the late spring and early summer. \n\nWith the exception of Carregal (CAR), in all other sites of Ria de Aveiro, ripe \n\nindividuals were present (Figure II.8). However, by making a seasonal analysis, it was \n\npossible to observe that mature individuals were only captured in spring and summer \n\n(Figure II.8). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 82 \n\n \n\nFigure II.8 \u2013 Percentage of individuals per maturity stage (I, II, III and IV) throughout the \n\nseasonal and spatial variation, along the Ria de Aveiro. \n\n \n\nII.4.4.

Immature females ranged between 28 \n\nmm and 73.9 mm, and developing specimens ranged between 45.2 mm and 114.6 mm. \n\nMaturing females were caught with mantle length from 122.1mm to 185.0 mm, and \n\nfemales in ripe conditions varied from 106.4 mm to 190.0 mm.

Maturing males were caught with mantle length ranged from \n\n82.7 to 130 mm, and males in ripe conditions varied from 78 mm to 208 mm. From the \n\n295 cuttlefishes caught in Ria de Aveiro, 89 were females and 105 were males, \n\nsignificant differences in the GSI values were obtained between seasons for both \n\nfemales (H = 29.6, P<0.001) and males (H = 54.9, P<0.001). Females showed high GSI \n\nvalues from April to July, noticing greater increase from April to June and a marked \n\ndecrease from June to July (Figure II.9). The females caught in June had the higher GSI \n\nof the study period, and the principal maturity stage of the females in that month \n\nbelongs to the third maturity stage (III), the developing stage. A similar pattern was \n\nnoticed for males, with higher GSI index in June, although these values were \n\nconsiderably lower than those registered for females (Figure II.9). Significant \n\ndifferences in the GSI values were obtained between maturity stages for both females \n\n(H = 52.2, P<0.001) and males (H = 73.2, P<0.001).

Discussion \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro, similar to other coastal estuarine lagoons (Leeuwen et al., 1994; \n\nElliot and Hemingway, 2002), is a system highly influenced by abiotic variations, which \n\naffect the recruitment and the survival of several species (Rebelo, 1992; Pombo and \n\nRebelo, 2002). S. officinalis presented a wide dispersion in the Ria de Aveiro, where \n\nAre\u00e3o (ARE), southern site of the lagoon, in the Mira channel, was the only site of the \n\nlagoon where cuttlefish was not found. Depth and salinity were the two main external \n\nfactors affecting the spatial distribution of the cuttlefish in the lagoon. ARE could \n\nrepresent the minimum quota in terms of salinity and depths for cuttlefish presence. \n\nOther authors referred that cuttlefish tolerate values of salinity between 25 (Palmegiano \n\nand D\u2019Apote, 1983) and 38 (Boletzky, 1983). Several authors referred that external \n\nparameters such as salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc. affect the \n\ndevelopment of the Sepia officinalis life cycle (Palmegiano and D\u2019apote, 1983; \n\nBouchaud and Daguzan, 1990; Domingues et al., 2001b). Temperature clearly plays a \n\nmajor role in determining the life span of S. officinalis (Richard, 1971; Forsythe et al. \n\n1991, 1994). Indeed, the Cuttlefish abundance in Ria de Aveiro lagoon starts to increase \n\nin April, when water temperature begins to increase and reproduction is triggered. In \n\nautumn, adults seem to disappear. This behavior could result from the mass mortality \n\nafter spawning or the return of adults to sea. The pattern of migration found in Ria de \n\nAveiro is in accordance to Richard (1971), Boletzky (1983) and Martins (1990). S. \n\nofficinalis migrates inshore in spring and summer and move offshore in autumn. During \n\nthe warm seasons (spring and summer), cuttlefish migrates to coastal waters, where \n\nphysical conditions are more stable than offshore and food availability is higher. In late \n\nautumn, when temperature begins to decrease, cuttlefish migrates offshore and almost \n\ndisappears from the lagoon. Abundance was much higher in summer then in autumn, \n\nwhile spring presented the higher biomass. This abundance pattern presented in the Ria \n\nde Aveiro is in accordance with other geographical areas, like the English Channel \n\n(Dunn, 1999; Wang et al., 2003; Challier et al., 2005); the Estuary of Sado in Setubal \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 87 \n\n(Portugal) (Neves et al., 2009) and the French coast (Morbihan Bay) (Blanc et al., \n\n1998).  \n\nThe spawning season (spring and summer) found in this study was the same as the one \n\ndetermined for the Estuary of Sado (Portugal) (Neves et al., 2009), but different to \n\nGuerra and Castro (1988) in Ria de Vigo and to Jorge and Sobral (2004) for Ria de \n\nAveiro. In both studies mature individuals were found throughout the year. In this \n\nstudied the immature individuals dominate along the year suggesting a very young \n\npopulation of cuttlefish. Jorge and Sobral (2004) reported two spawning seasons for Ria \n\nthe Aveiro, one more representative in June and August and other in February and \n\nOctober, however in this studied only one was evidenced.  \n\nThe stable conditions found in Ria de Aveiro during spring and summer months, and the \n\nhigh diversity of habitats and high prey availability represent good conditions for \n\nreproduction, especially for smaller individuals. The development of juveniles and the \n\ndifferences between individuals are really dependent on the environmental conditions \n\n(Challier et al., 2002; Dunn, 1999; Domingues et al., 2002; Koueta and Boucaud-\n\nCamou, 2003). Individuals that are born in the lagoon during summer are likely to grow \n\nfaster, reaching maturity at lower age (compared to those born in the coastal zone), and \n\nbecoming mature for reproduction in their first year. Individuals born in other seasons \n\nwill have poorer conditions for a rapid growth and will probably reach maturity at older \n\nages. This phenomenon is apparently related with the time interval spent at higher \n\ntemperatures (Domingues et al., 2001b).  \n\nMales reach sexual maturity before the females (Gauvrit et al., 1997) being usually \n\nsmaller than females (Pinczon du Sel and Daguzan, 1997). In the North Atlantic, \n\ncuttlefish can mature before one year old, although many individuals mature during \n\ntheir second year of life (Gauvrit et al., 1997). Several studies reported the first length \n\nof ripe individuals for males and females (Table II-V). All the studies presented a lower \n\nfirst length for maturity for males than females with the exception of Jorge and Sobral \n\n(2004). The value obtained in this work is much similar with the values presented in \n\nMediterranean (Mangold-Wirz, 1963), in Golfo de Tunes (Ezzedine-Najal, 1984) and in \n\nsouth Brittany (Le Goff and Daguzan, 1991), being higher than Guerra and Castro \n\n(1988), in Ria de Vigo, \u00d6nsoy and Salman (2005), in Aegean Sea and Neves et al. \n\n(2009), in Estuary of Sado and much lower than Dunn et al. (1999), in the English \n\nChannel. \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 88 \n\nTable II-V \u2013 Mean values (mm) of first length in ripe individuals for males and females, in \n\ncuttlefish from the literature. \n\n \n\n \n\nSeveral authors referred that temperature is determinant in Sepia officinalis \n\ndevelopment (Palmegiano and D\u2019apote, 1983; Bouchaud and Daguzan, 1990; \n\nDomingues et al., 2001b) since it is a poikilothermic (Forsythe and Van Heukelen, \n\n1987), so the differences found in the first maturity length of cuttlefish in those referred \n\nareas could be the result of differences in water temperature.  \n\nThe length-weight relationship in this studied showed that, females are heavier than \n\nmales for individuals larger than 82.4 mm. Dunn (1999) and Neves et al. (2009) found \n\nthe same relationship, females became heavier than males at 106 mm and 108mm in \n\nSado Estuary and English channel, respectively. The differences between males and \n\nfemales weight-length relationship could be due to different sexual developments, since \n\nthis development has a bigger importance for females than males (Dunn, 1999). For \n\nsame sex, the differences could result from other factors like quantity and quality of diet \n\nand temperature of water (Mangold-Wirz, 1963; Hatfield, 2000; Domingues et al., \n\n2001b). \n\nOther authors reported the occurrence of two breeder generations during the spawning \n\nperiod, which are recognized by their mantle length (Mangold-Wirz, 1963; Le Goff and \n\nDaguzan, 1991; Gauvrit et al., 1997; Dunn et al., 1999; \u00d6nsoy and Salman, 2005). \n\nConsidering Le Goff and Daguzan (1991), breeders in first year of life presented an \n\naverage of mantle length of 134 mm for males and 148 mm for females, while breeders \n\nof second year showed approximately 220 mm ML, for both sexes. According to these \n\nvalues, all mature individuals presented in this study were in their first year of life. \n\nmales (mm) females (mm) Location Reference\n\n78 106 Ria de Aveiro This study\n\n80 110 Mediterranean Mangold-Wirz (1963)\n\n80 100 Golfo de Tunes Ezzedine-Najal (1984)\n\n60 80 Ria de Vigo Guerra and Castro (1988)\n\n80 110 South Brittany Le Goff and Daguzan (1991)\n\n146 170 English channel  Dunn et al.

(2009)\n\nFirst lenght in ripe individuals\n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n| P a g e 89 \n\nIn Ria de Aveiro, only one breeding generation was found, with an average of 98 mm \n\nDML in females and 99 mm DML in males, which is in accordance to Jorge and Sobral \n\n(2004), which referred that both males and females reach their maturity approximately \n\nwith 90 mm of DML. \n\nThe present study showed that Sepia officinalis feeds preferentially from Portunidae \n\n(crabs) and fish, this is in accordance with other authors like Alves et al. (2006); Castro \n\nand Guerra, 1990 and Pinczon du Sel et al. (2000). Several other taxa appears as \n\noccasional preys e.g. amphipods, worms, isopods, which was also referred in other \n\nstudies (Castro and Guerra, 1990; Najai and Ktari, 1979). Differences in terms of \n\nimportance of prey items in feeding habits of cuttlefish, as well the presence of more \n\nspecies, are probably consequences of different habitats, predator size and number of \n\nanalysed guts (Castro and Guerra, 1990; Pinczon du Sel et al., 2000). Cannibalism was \n\noccasionally referred by Najai and Ktari (1979); Castro and Guerra, 1990), which is in \n\naccordance with this study. Predators that feed on a wide variety of preys from different \n\nhabitats have a generalist diet as well as opportunistic, attacking all prey within the \n\nphysical capability of the predator (Hughes, 1980). Opportunistic predation is typical of \n\ncephalopods (Boucher-Rodoni et al., 1987). In this study, due to the wide range of preys \n\nfound in the diet of Sepia officinalis, the assumptions refered above do apply to \n\ncuttlefish of the Aveiro lagoon. \n\n \n\nII.6. Conclusions \n\nFurther studies in Ria de Aveiro and adjacent coastal waters would be needed to better \n\nunderstand the reproductive life cycle of S. officinalis on the north Portuguese coast and \n\nto understand the differences on the reproductive strategies of cuttlefish with other \n\ngeographical regions of the world. \n\n \n\nII.7.

Accumulation of metals in common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in a temperate \n\nlagoon \n\n \n\nIII.1. Abstract \n\nConcentrations of essential (Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) metals were \n\ndetermined in the tissues (mantle and digestive gland) of 53 individuals of the common \n\ncuttlefish Sepia officinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), captured in six different sites in the Ria de \n\nAveiro from March to December of 2003. Over decades, these types of marine \n\necosystems have been subject to discharges of effluents as a result of industrial and \n\nharbour activities, as well as urban and agricultural wastes. In this study, like other \n\nEuropean studies on cephalopods, metal concentrations in digestive gland were much \n\nhigher than those found in mantle, which suggests that digestive gland is the target \n\norgan for storage of these elements, acting as a detoxification organ. Size, sex and \n\nseason don\u00b4t interfere with metal concentration. The metal concentrations obtained in \n\neach analysed tissue follow the gradient: Zn>Fe>Cu>Cd>Pb. The results suggest a \n\ngradient of contamination in the direction of Laranjo. However, in terms of metal \n\nconcentrations, the Ria de Aveiro can be divided in two distinct regions, the first one \n\ncomprising the site LAR, and the second one including all the others. All individuals \n\ncaptured in LAR presented levels of Cd in mantle higher than the limit proposed for \n\nhuman consumption (1 \u00b5g g\n-1 \n\nwet weight). For Pb the most problematic area is TOR \n\npresenting almost all the values higher than the limit for human consumption (1 \u00b5g g\n-1 \n\nwet weight). Cadmium is positively correlated with Cu in the digestive gland of the \n\nspecimens collected in Ria de Aveiro. The ratios of Cd:Zn and Cd:Cu presented \n\nsignificant differences in the different sites of sampling. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 102 \n\nIII.2. Introduction \n\nCephalopods eat a great variety of organisms, being carnivorous opportunistic predators \n\nwith very high growth efficiency, and a rapid maturation that is followed by a single \n\nspawning season and, with few exceptions, an early death (Boyle, 1990). They are also \n\nconsumed in large quantities by higher trophic levels, such as mammals, seabirds and \n\nfish, which support the idea that cephalopods are potentially capable of supporting \n\nsignificantly increased levels of exploitation (Boyle, 1990). For this reason this group of \n\nmarine molluscs are considered as key species in several marine ecosystems \n\n(Amaratunga, 1983; Rodhouse, 1989; Bustamante, 2002). \n\nCephalopods are known for their ability to accumulate high levels of essential elements \n\nto metabolic functions as well as non-essential elements (Martin and Flegal, 1975; \n\nMiramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 1998a, b, 2000; Raimundo et al., \n\n2004). Furthermore, metal levels in cephalopods, which are extensively fished and \n\nconsumed by humans, are also of direct concern for public health (Bustamante et al., \n\n2004). Various studies have reported metal concentrations in cephalopods from several \n\nregions such as Smith et al., (1984); Miramand and Bentley, (1992); Bustamante et al., \n\n(2000); Raimundo et al., (2005); Pereira et al., (2009). At Ria de Aveiro only one study \n\n(Pereira et al., 2009) addressed this issue, but it is based in a narrow site selection and \n\ndidn\u00b4t explore the spatial variability, that may be relevant due to the presence of \n\nindustrial contaminated effluents.  \n\nSediments in coastal systems, which are surrounded by urbanized and industrialized \n\nareas, may contain high quantities of metals that may become available to benthic \n\norganisms and eventually transferred to upper levels, thus affecting the marine food \n\nchain (Bryan and Langston, 1992; Lee and Luoma, 1998; Warren et al., 1998), or be \n\nremobilized when sediments are dredged and disposed into water bodies (Newell et al., \n\n1998). The Ria de Aveiro is a shallow productive coastal lagoon, located on the west \n\ncoast of Portugal, with a complex network of inner channels into which industrial and \n\ndomestic effluents have been discharged for many years (Hall, 1982). Cuttlefish, Sepia \n\nofficinalis, is economically important target specie for Portuguese fisheries (Serrano, \n\n1992). Taking into account the economic importance of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and \n\nthe absence of reported information about metal concentrations in closed and \n\nanthropogenic influenced ecosystems, like Ria the Aveiro, the present study proposed \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 103 \n\n \n\nthe assessment of metal concentrations in cuttlefish from several locations of the inner \n\npart of the Ria de Aveiro.  \n\n \n\nIII.3. Materials and methods \n\nIII.3.1. Study Area  \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro (40\u00b038\u00b4N, 8\u00b044\u00b4W) \n\n(Figure III.1) is a very important coastal \n\nsystem in the Portuguese west coast, with an \n\nadjacent area of about 250 km\n2\n (Picado et \n\nal., 2010).  The lagoon has a maximum \n\nwidth of 10 km and its length measured \n\nalong the longitudinal axis is 45 km (Dias \n\nand Lopes, 2006). The average depth of the \n\nlagoon compared to the mean sea level is \n\nabout 3 m, although the inlet channel can \n\nexceed 28 m deep, due to dredging \n\noperations that are regularly carried out to \n\nallow the navigation (Picado et al., 2010). \n\nThis coastal ecosystem is permanently \n\nconnected to the sea (350 m width) and was \n\nfirst stabilized by man (Plecha et al., 2007). \n\nThe hydrodynamics of the lagoon is \n\nessentially dominated by tidal currents \n\nentering its mouth (Hall et al., 1985; Dias et \n\nal., 2000; Lopes and Dias, 2007) which are \n\nresponsible for the mixes of freshwater and \n\nseawater. Rivers have small overall \n\ncontribution in terms of water inputs, when compared with the tidal prism, but have a \n\nlong-term influence in the residual transport (Lopes and Dias, 2007). The four major \n\nrivers converging to the Ria are Vouga and Antu\u00e3 Rivers from the East, Caster River \n\nfrom the North and Boco River from the Southeast. The fresh water input in a spring \n\ntide is estimated in 1.8 x 10\n6\n m\n\n3\n (Moreira et al., 1993; Dias et al., 2001), while the tidal \n\nprism can range from 35 to 137 x 10\n6\n m\n\n3\n (Dias et al., 2001; Lilleb\u00d8 et al., 2011). The \n\nFigure III.1 - Sampling sites of S. \n\nofficinalis: Ria de Aveiro (Adapted \n\nfrom Valentim et al., 2013). \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 104 \n\nmajor freshwater input comes from the Vouga River (50m\n3\n s\n\n_1\n average flow) and Antu\u00e3 \n\nRiver (5m\n3\n s\n\n-1\n average flow). The Vouga River contributes with around 2/3 of the \n\nfluvial water entering the lagoon (Moreira et al., 1993; Dias et al., 1999).  \n\nIn terms of sediments quality, the lagoon receives considerable flows of raw and treated \n\nwastewater. Three main sources of pollution are apparent: organic and chemical \n\npollution from paper-pulp factories (in rivers Vouga and Caima); chemical pollution, \n\nparticularly mercury, from the industrial area of Estarreja (in Laranjo), and microbial \n\ncontaminants from the urban sewage effluent and cattle raising areas (\u00cdlhavo channel, \n\nVouga river and Ovar channel) (Lima, 1986; Lucas et al., 1986; Borrego et al., 1994; \n\nPastorinho et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\nIII.3.2. Sampling and biological data collection \n\nA total of 53 cuttlefishes, S. officinalis, were caught monthly with a network trammel, \n\nfrom March 2003 to December 2003, at six sites (Figure III.1): near the mouth of the \n\nlagoon (BAR, POR and GAF); in the main freshwater section, highly organically \n\nenriched (RIO); in a contaminated area, result of industrial pollution (LAR), and \n\napproximately in the middle of the longest channel (TOR). The abiotic parameters such \n\nas temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, turbidity and depth were registered on \n\neach capture. Temperature (\u00b1 0.1 \u00baC) and dissolved oxygen (\u00b1 0.01 mg.l\n-1\n\n) were \n\nrecorded with an oxygen meter (Consort Z621), the pH (\u00b1 0.01) with pH meter (WTW \n\n330/set \u2013 2), the salinity (\u00b1 0.1) with a refractometer (Atago), the turbidity (\u00b1 0.1 m) \n\nwas recorded with a Secchi disc and the depth (\u00b1 0.1m) with a handmade probe. Dorsal \n\nmantle length (DML, size), total weight (Wt), sex and maturity stage were determined \n\nfor each individual. All individuals were included in an allometric relationship between \n\ntotal weight (g) and mantle length (mm) (Figure III.2). The number of individuals (n), \n\nwet weight range (g), size range (mm), sex and maturity stage from each site is given in \n\nTable III-II. A standard 5-point scale of sexual maturity for S. officinalis was used \n\n(adapted from Alonso-Allende and Guerra, 1984), in which stage I is \u201cimmature\u201d, \n\nstages II-III are \u201dmaturing\u201d, and stages IV-V are \u201cmature\u201d. Specimens with no visible \n\ngonad development were classified as \u201cjuveniles\u201d (Challier et al., 2002) and allocated in \n\nmaturity stage 1. Specimens were stored in individual plastic bags and immediately \n\nfrozen, in order to minimize mobilization of metals between organs (Martin and Flegal, \n\n1975). In the laboratory, the digestive gland of each specimen was totally removed \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 105 \n\nunder defrost conditions, without rupture of the outer membrane, and weighted. \n\nSamples of mantle free from skin and inner membrane were also taken.  \n\n \n\nIII.3.3. Analysis of metals \n\nTissue samples were lyophilised and homogenised. Approximately 200 mg of the dry \n\ntissue was digested with a mixture of HNO3 (sp, 65% v/v) and H2O2 (sp, 30% v/v) at \n\ndifferent temperatures according to the method described in Ferreira et al. (1990). All \n\nlaboratory ware was cleaned with HNO3 (20%) for 2 days and rinsed with Milli-Q water \n\nto avoid contamination. The selection of the analytical methodology and apparatus to \n\nuse in metal quantification was determined by metal concentration present in the tissues. \n\nQuantification of Fe, Zn and Cu in mantle and digestive gland and Cd in digestive gland \n\nwas performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer Analyst 100) \n\nwhile quantification of Cd in mantle and Pb in the mantle and digestive gland were \n\nanalysed using ICP-MS. The accuracy of the analytical methods was assessed by the \n\nanalysis of international certificate standards: DORM-1, DORM-2 (dogfish muscle) and \n\nTORT-1, TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas) (National Research Council of Canada). \n\nBlanks and standard references materials were run together with samples. The values \n\nobtained and the certificated values do not differ significantly (p<0.05) (Table III-I). \n\nConcentration of metal was expressed relative to both the dry weight (\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWt) and \n\nthe wet weight of the tissue (\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n WWt). The dry weight values are used for statistical \n\nanalysis, to eliminate any effects of varying moisture content while the wet weight is \n\nused for calculating risks associated with consumption of cuttlefish tissue (Pierce et al., \n\n2008). The values in wet weight were calculated with the percentage of humidity of \n\neach tissue. Under our analysis conditions, the detection limits (\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n) were: 4.2 (Fe); \n\n0.50 (Zn), 1.2 (Cu), 0.089 (for Cd in Perkin Elmer Analyst 100) and 0.0055 (for Cd in \n\nICP-MS) and 0.0040 (Pb). Precision varied between 1 and 8%. \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 106 \n\nTable III-I - Concentration of metals in certified reference materials used to accuracy analytical \n\nquality control (mean\u00b1SD; \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n dry weight). \n\n \n\n \n\nIII.3.4. Statistical analysis \n\nSpecific weight metal concentrations were calculated as a function of dry weight. \n\nNormality of data and homogeneity of variance were tested using the Anderson-Darling \n\ntest and Levene\u00b4s test, respectively. Whenever significant deviations from normality and \n\nhomoscedasticity were found, data was log-transformed prior to further statistical \n\nanalysis to correct those deviations. For each metal, statistical comparisons between \n\nsites, and sex were performed using a two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey \n\ncomparisons, whenever significant differences were found. Pairing site and season was \n\nalso used to assess seasonality effects using a two way ANOVA. Statistical testing was \n\ncarried out with MINITAB\u00ae Release 14.20. A significance level of 0.05 was used for \n\nall tests. Redundancy Analysis (RDA), a technique that falls between multiple \n\nregression and canonical correlation analysis (Sparks et al., 1999), was performed using \n\nthe CANOCO software package for windows, version 4.5 to assess effects of \n\nenvironmental conditions on metal content. The significance of RDA was tested using a \n\nMonte Carlo permutation test using routines built into the software package. A complete \n\ndescription of the method is provided in Van den Brink et al. (2003). \n\n \n\nIII.4. Results \n\nIII.4.1.

Metal concentration mantle vs digestive gland \n\nMetal concentration in mantle and digestive gland in all sites, was significantly different \n\n(p<0.05). As expected the concentrations in the digestive gland were higher, indicating \n\nthat these metals are preferentially accumulated in this organ. Depending on the \n\nsampling site, the values in digestive gland varied between one and three orders of \n\nmagnitude above the mantle values (Table III-III and Figure III.3) for almost all metals \n\nstudied. \n\n \n\nIII.4.5. Relationships between Cd:Zn and Cd:Cu ratios \n\nThe ratios Cd:Zn and Cd:Cu were calculated\n \nin mantle and digestive glands for all the \n\nspecimens at each site (Pereira et al., 2009) and ANOVA was tested to check \n\ndifferences between sites, sex, size and season (Table III-V). For mantle, no significant \n\ndifferences were found for sampling station, sex or season, although for digestive \n\nglands both ratios presented significant differences for sampling station (Table III-V). \n\nFor the ratio Cd:Zn the higher value was 0.52 for POR and for the ratio Cd:Cu the \n\nhigher value was 0.31 for BAR. No significant differences were found for sex and \n\nseason. Moreover, ratios and tissues showed no significant differences when size of \n\nspecimens was used as covariate. As observed for metal concentration in both tissues \n\n(mantle and digestive gland) also the ratios of Cd:Cu and Cd:Zn differ of one and two \n\norders of magnitude, respectively. No correlation was observed with body weight and \n\nratios with the exception of the ratio Cd:Cu in digestive gland that presented a positive \n\ncorrelation. \n\n \n\nTable III-V - Factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing statistical comparisons between \n\nsites and sex of essential (Fe, Zn and Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) metals in mantle and \n\ndigestive gland of S. officinalis. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nRatios Factors F\nSignificance\n\n(p value)\nConclusions F\n\nSignificance\n\n(p value)\nConclusions\n\nMantle Digestive Gland\n\nCd:Cu\n\nCd:Zn\n\nF5, 47=8.53\n\nF5, 47=3.57\n\n<0.001 (S)\n\n0.008 (S)\n\nPOR?BAR=TOR=GAF=RIO=LAR\n\nNot conclusive\n\nSite\n\nSite\n\nF5, 47=1.01 0.420   (NS) -\n\nF5, 47=1.26 0.296   (NS) -\n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 111 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.3 - Boxplot of Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in S. officinalis for mantle and digestive gland vs \n\nsites sampling (\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWt). \n\nMantle Digestive gland \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 112 \n\nIII.4.6.

Copper was positively correlated (p<0.05) to Cadmium and lead \n\n(p<0.001). Other authors have also studied these correlations, due to the quimical \n\ncorrelation of these metals (Pereira et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nFigure III.4 \u2013 Correlations between [Cu] vs [Cd] and [Cu] vs [Pb] in the digestive glands of S. \n\nofficinalis from Ria the Aveiro (n=53; p<0.001). \n\n \n\nOnly lead concentrations were significantly correlated in mantle and digestive gland \n\n(r=0.333; n=53; p=0.015). \n\n \n\nIII.4.7. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) \n\nThe multivariate ordination (RDA) of metal concentrations within different sites of Ria \n\nde Aveiro (Figure III.5) support the results from univariate analyses (ANOVA). \n\nHowever, some differences in specific element were found, because RDA considered all \n\nthe elements simultaneously rather than one at the time. The first RDA axis (horizontal \n\naxis) explains 38.7 % of the total variance of metals between sites, and the second one \n\n(vertical axis) 27.5 %. Both axes explain 66.2 % of the total variability. The third axis \n\nexplained only 21.1 % of the total variation, and therefore it was not considered. Monte \n\nCarlo permutation tests on RDA results showed that the first axis is statistically \n\nsignificant (p=0.016). Similar results were obtained when all canonical axes were \n\nconsidered (p=0.002). Most of the observed variability in metal concentrations in tissues \n\nof Sepia officinalis was associated with differences between individuals within a site \n\n(72.2 %) while 20.4 % was associated with differences between sites and 7.4 % was \n\nexplained by covariates (total weight, length, and digestive gland weight).

Nevertheless, Laranjo is clearly separated from other sites presenting higher \n\nvalues of metal concentrations with the exception of Cd quantities in the digestive \n\ngland, as mentioned previously. Levels of Pb in mantle are strongly correlated with Pb \n\nconcentrations in digestive gland, suggesting once more the weak affinity of the \n\ndigestive gland to Pb. The opposite occurs with the accumulation of Cd in both tissues, \n\nwhere levels of Cd in mantle are much lower than levels of Cd in digestive gland. \n\nTorreira (TOR) is the site with higher variability, whereas POR is the area with lower \n\nvariability with the exception of few values that presented extremely high values of Cd \n\nin the digestive gland. Commercial Port (POR) is strongly associated with higher depths \n\nand saturated oxygen in water. Barra presented a central distribution of metals, \n\npresenting the lowest values of metals concentrations and the factor that apparently \n\ninfluences more is the salinity, showing the highest values of salinity which could be \n\nexplained by the proximity of the sea.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.5 - Triplot of metals concentrations in both tissues and abiotic parameters in six sites of \n\nRia de Aveiro. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1staxis\n\n2ndaxis\n\n-1.0 1.5\n\n-0\n.6\n\n0\n.8\n\nFe-M\n\nZn-M\n\nCu-M\n\nCd-M\n\nPb-M\n\nFe-Dg\n\nZn-Dg\n\nCu-Dg\n\nCd-Dg\n\nPb-DgDepth\n\nTurbidity\n\nTemperature\n\nSalinity\n\npH\n\nO2\n\nBarra Porto Gafanha\n\nTorreira Rio Laranjo\n\nDescriptors Environmental factors\n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 114 \n\nIII.4.8.

Discussion \n\nThe strong correlation between length and weight is independent of site and season, this \n\nwas also observed by others authors like Pereira (2003); Raimundo et al. (2005); Pereira \n\net al. (2009). \n\nThe levels of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in the digestive gland are higher, comparing with \n\nthe values in mantle. The same trend was observed in other studies with different \n\ncephalopod species (Raimundo et al., 2004; Raimundo et al., 2005; Pereira, 2003; \n\nPereira et al., 2009).

Various studies \n\nconfirmed that the digestive gland of cephalopods concentrates high levels of Zn and \n\nCu, and have an exceptional ability to store Cd (Miramand and Guary, 1980; \n\nBustamante et al., 1998b, 2002a; Raimundo et al., 2009). For TOR and GAF, the level \n\nof Pb was equal in the mantle and digestive gland (i.e. same order of magnitude) this \n\nmay be caused by a higher availability of lead in these sites. This fact could be related \n\nwith the location of both sites in Ria de Aveiro, GAF is situated in the vicinity of a \n\ndeep-sea fishing port and dry-docks and also connected with the main channel coming \n\nfrom Aveiro city carrying domestic discharges, and TOR, in an intermediate region of \n\nthe longest channel (S. Jacinto-Ovar channel), containing a higher number of \n\nrecreational boats. However, until such assumptions are confirmed by levels of Pb in the \n\nwater, they remain highly speculative. \n\nIn general, metal concentrations obtained in this study for mantle and digestive gland of \n\nS. officinalis were higher when compared with values reported for same species and \n\nother cephalopods of various studies (Table III-VI). Comparisons with specimens from \n\ndifferent ecosystems must be carefully made, as identical species may exhibit different \n\nfeeding habits, growth rates and habitats, which may interfere with metal accumulation \n\n(Bustamante et al., 1998b; Raimundo et al., 2004; Pierce et al., 2008). However, the \n\nvalues obtained were comparable to previous data obtained along the Portuguese coast \n\n(Pereira et al., 2009; Seixas et al., 2005; Raimundo et al., 2005, 2008). Indeed, when \n\ncompared with levels of S. officinalis of the same area (Pereira et al., 2009) the values \n\nobtained are higher or very similar, with the exception of Pb whose value was lower. \n\nFor different geographic regions, the only exception was the slightly lower values of Fe, \n\nZn and Cu obtained when compared to specimens captured in Mediterranean Sea and \n\nEnglish Channel (Miramand and Guary, 1980; Miramand and Bentley, 1992) (Table \n\nIII-VI).  \n\nThe most striking aspect was the extremely high value of Cd in mantle of specimens \n\ncaptured in Laranjo (LAR) and the relatively low value of this element in digestive \n\ngland (when compared with values of Cd obtained for POR and TOR in the digestive \n\ngland). The increase of Cd in mantle, without a corresponding increase in the digestive \n\ngland, organ where this element is stored (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002a; \n\nBustamante et al., 2002b; Raimundo et al., 2009) suggests a large transference of Cd \n\ndirectly from water. This fact probably indicates an acute exposition and a recent uptake \n\nfrom water. \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 116 \n\nFor Cd the values obtained in all sites of Ria de Aveiro are higher than the values \n\nmeasured in previous studies (see Table III-VI). This pattern of high levels of Cd in \n\ndigestive glands of specimens captured in Ria de Aveiro appears to be a sign of higher \n\nCd exposure. In reality, studies of distribution and accumulation of metals in sediments \n\nof Ria de Aveiro presented high Cd concentrations in the lagoon (Monterroso et al., \n\n2003a). Due to the species mobility and the different availability of preys along the \n\nlagoon, metal concentrations in tissues cannot be exclusively viewed as direct reflex of \n\nenvironmental conditions. However, there is no doubt that the contamination of Cd in \n\nRia de Aveiro is essentially a result of the industrial complex of Estarreja, near the bay \n\nof Laranjo and the contamination of others locals of the lagoon are made by transport of \n\ncontaminated sediments and water to the lagoon by tidal currents of Ria the Aveiro \n\n(Pereira et al., 1998; Monterroso et al., 2003a) and by plankton exportation (Monterroso \n\net al., 2003b). Bustamante et al. (2000) suggested that high Cd levels in digestive \n\nglands of species captured in contaminated areas are related to the surrounding \n\nenvironment. Commercial Port presented a really high value of Cd when compared with \n\nother sites, which could be related with the activities of the Port and also with the fact \n\nthat this area forms a sort of bay which is influenced by tides that lead the contaminants \n\ninto the bay and remain there accumulated. However, it\u00b4s also an area of refuge were \n\nfisheries are not allowed and probably a site where cuttlefish from other sites seek \n\nrefuge. This idea might be supported by the increase number of specimens captured in \n\nthis site in comparison with other sites (Table III-II). \n\nMetal concentrations increase as the distance from the sea increase. This metal \n\ndistribution pattern in digestive gland appears to reflect the location of anthropogenic \n\nsources of metals discharged in the northern region of Ria de Aveiro (Monterroso, et al., \n\n2003a). Laranjo (LAR) and Torreira (TOR) are, probably, the most contaminated areas, \n\npresenting the highest values of essential (Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) \n\nmetals for digestive gland (Figure III.3). The higher values presented in Torreira (TOR) \n\nsuggests that this local suffers the influence of Largo da Coroa, considered the second \n\nmost contaminated area after Laranjo bay in Ria de Aveiro (Monterroso et al., 2003a). \n\nOnce more, metal concentrations in cephalopods could also vary according to the \n\nlocation where individuals were captured (Bustamante et al., 1998b; Seixas et al., 2005; \n\nBustamante et al., 2008; Pierce et al., 2008).  \n\nFor metal-metal relationship in digestive gland and mantle, only Pb presented a low \n\ncorrelation between the two tissues, this could be related with the fact that food is the \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 117 \n\nmain source of metal contamination in cephlopods (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et \n\nal., 2002b).  \n\nOnly the ratio Cd:Cu in digestive gland presented a positive correlation with wet body \n\nweight, meaning that Cd was progressively sequestrated in digestive gland with age. \n\nThis pattern was also observed for S. officinalis in Pereira et al. (2009) and for O. \n\nvulgaris in Raimundo et al. (2005). \n\nMiramand and Bentley (1992) and Bustamante (1998) showed that due to the \n\nsimilarities in chemical behaviour, Cd (non-essential metal), when in high \n\nconcentrations in digestive gland, can compete with Zn and Cu (essential metals) for the \n\nsame ligands, specific metalloproteins presented in digestive gland of cephalopods. For \n\nthis reason it would be expected significant correlations between Cd-Cu and Cd-Zn, like \n\nin Pereira et al. (2009), however in this study it was only found significant correlations \n\n(P<0.01) for Cd and Cu in digestive gland. In Aveiro lagoon the specimens captured in \n\nPOR (Commercial Port) presented high levels of Cd and the highest value of ratio \n\nCd:Cu in the digestive gland, significantly different (P<0.05) than others (see Table \n\nIII-V). Since essential elements tend to be maintained at a fairly constant concentration \n\nin tissues, Cd:Cu ratios increase in cephalopods contaminated by Cd (Bustamante et al., \n\n1998a; Raimundo et al., 2005; Pereira et al.,2009).  \n\nIn Mediterranean countries, the whole body of small cuttlefish is usually consumed. For \n\nbigger specimens, the digestive gland is often removed, but due to the high levels of Cd \n\nin the digestive gland, contamination of Cd in the mantle is frequent. This contributes \n\nsignificantly to Cd intake, since the mass of digestive gland is approximately 10% of the \n\nmantle, and the Cd content of other organs is negligible due to their small masses and \n\nlow Cd concentrations (Miramand and Bentley, 1992), one may estimate that 95% of \n\ntotal body burden of Cd is stored in the digestive gland. Thus, frequent consumption of \n\nthese small cuttlefish by humans might pose serious health risks. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III  \n\n| P a g e 118 \n\nTable III-VI \u2013 Reported metal concentrations (mean\u00b1SD \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n or range) in different tissues of different cephalopod species. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecies Site Tissue Fe Zn Cu Cd Pb Origin Reference\n\nSepiidae\n\nSepia officinalis Ria de Aveiro Mantle 19.8\u00b17.5 62.9\u00b15.5 8.7\u00b12.6 0.22\u00b10.17 0.58\u00b11.4 Portuguese Coast This study\n\nS. officinalis Ria de Aveiro Dig.

Conclusions \n\nThe digestive gland of S. officinalis has an extraordinary capacity to storage elements \n\nlike metals, especially Zn, Cu and Cd. It seems that this organ also has the ability to \n\nredistribute these elements into the mantle of cuttlefish. For these reasons the digestive \n\ngland is considered a biomarker of potential contamination by metals in cuttlefish. \n\nS. officinalis shows a predisposition to accumulate Cd and was considered, like other \n\ncephalopods, by Bustamante et al. (1998b) as a vector for transfer of Cd to top marine \n\npredators. Cuttlefishes captured in Ria de Aveiro presented, in digestive gland and in \n\nsome mantles, high levels of Cd, which seems to be a response to Cd contamination in \n\nmarine ecosystems. Results also suggest that there can be higher accumulation of Cd on \n\nthe mantle, rather than on the digestive gland, in environmental ecosystems with high \n\nlevels of Cd. Owing to this contamination level of Cd in organisms near potential \n\nsources of contamination more studies with high number of individuals should be \n\ndeveloped to ashore the good quality of the captured cuttlefish. Until now it seems that \n\nthe mechanisms of sequestration and detoxification occurring in the digestive gland are \n\neffective to ashore the normal development of cuttlefish. \n\nDue to the local economic importance of S. officinalis for the region of Aveiro, and for \n\nbeing a target specie for this type of studies, further studies should be developed in \n\nstrategic sites of the lagoon (Laranjo bay, Largo da Coroa and Commercial Port of \n\nAveiro), may be further supplemented by studies of monitoring metal concentrations \n\nwith emphasis on the function of the digestive gland as a storage organ of toxic \n\ncompounds and principal producer of metalloproteins to the sequestration of these \n\nelements. Beyond that, trace elements are generally considered for their potential \n\ntoxicity in ecotoxicological studies and biomonitoring surveys, and there is an increase \n\ninterest in their use to provide information on life history and trophic ecology of \n\ncephalopods.  \n\n \n\nIII.7.

Mercury concentration in mantle and digestive gland of common cuttlefish \n\nSepia officinalis in a coastal lagoon with historical point-source discharges \n\n(Aveiro, Portugal) \n\n \n\nIV.1.1. Abstract \n\nThe mercury (Hg) levels were measured in mantle and digestive gland of common \n\ncuttlefish, Sepia officinalis collected from six sites (Barra (BAR), Torreira (TOR), \n\nCommercial Port (POR), Gafanha (GAF), Rio Novo do Pr\u00edncipe (RIO), and Laranjo \n\n(LAR) in the Ria de Aveiro. The Hg concentrations were higher in Laranjo bay (1.2 and \n\n2.0 \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n, in mantle and digestive gland, respectively). In other areas the accumulation \n\nof Hg is much lower (0.25-0.65 \u00b5g g\n-1 \n\nin mantle and 0.40-1.20 \u00b5g g\n-1 \n\nin digestive gland). \n\nThe results suggest that the effect of mercury contamination in cuttlefish is restricted to \n\nthe Laranjo bay. Mercury in mantle and digestive gland were of the same order of \n\nmagnitude, indicating that the digestive gland does not have a specific affinity to store \n\nthis element. The 1.5 \u00b5g g\n-1 \n\ndry weight EU limit was only exceeded in one cuttlefish \n\nsample. It may concluded that the cuttlefishes studied do not constitute cause for \n\nconcern in terms of human consumption, and could be safely used for daily intake of \n\nessential elements.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n| P a g e 130 \n\nIV.1.2. Introduction \n\nMercury (Hg) is one of the most hazardous contaminants that may be present in aquatic \n\nenvironments, widely considered to be among the highest priority environmental \n\npollutants in the scope of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and on the \n\nglobal scale (Pereira et al., 2009a). Mercury is an element that has both natural and \n\nanthropogenic sources (OSPAR, 2004). Most of the anthropogenic mercury enters to \n\naquatic ecosystems in its inorganic form through diffuse sources or via point discharges \n\n(Baeyers et al., 2003). It is recognised that anthropogenic sources of mercury are \n\nresponsible for the highest environmental impacts (EPA, 1997), having deleterious \n\neffects on biota, including both Human health and ecosystem functions (Pereira et al., \n\n2009a). Mercury is accumulated by many aquatic organisms, transferred and magnified \n\nalong trophic chain (Baeyers et al., 2003), eventually finding its way to economically \n\nimportant species and ultimately to humans (Pereira et al, 2006). Although, the existing \n\nrestrictions on the anthropogenic sources of mercury, historically contaminated \n\nsediments may still constitute a source of mercury to the aquatic environment. In \n\ngeneral, mercury has a high affinity with suspended particles which contributes to its \n\nremoval from water and to sink in bottom sediments (Lee et al., 1998; Ramalhosa et al., \n\n2001, Ramalhosa et al., 2006). Thus, sediments may function as reservoir of \n\nanthropogenic mercury and/or as internal sources when metal is freed to pore-water \n\n(Arakel, 1995, May et al., 1997, Baeyers et al., 2003). Mercury retained in sediments \n\nmay be released to the water column through physical disturbance as redox potential, \n\ntemperature, oxygen, salinity, becoming available to aquatic organisms (Pereira et al., \n\n1998a, 1998b; Ramalhosa et al., 2006; Pato et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009a). The \n\nintegration of Hg may vary with different parameters such as biological (growth rate, \n\nsize, sex) ecological (food, habit) and environmental factors (Hg availability, \n\nmethylation rate, primary productivity) (Raimundo et al, 2010). \n\nAs several other cephalopod species, the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis is \n\nextensively fished and consumed by humans of coastal communities in Portugal, \n\nconsidered important target specie in fisheries having a high economic, social and \n\ncultural value. Therefore, contaminant levels in cephalopods are also of direct concern \n\nto public health, since they could represent an important vector of contaminant to the \n\nconsumers as shown for Cd (Bustamante et al., 1998a).  \n\nRia de Aveiro, an estuarine lagoon in the northwest of Portugal, is a biologically \n\nproductive system with a significant role in the life cycle of several organisms being \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n   Page | 131  \n\nused as nursery for many species, namely cuttlefish. Over five decades, this marine \n\nsystem received discharges of anthropogenic mercury from a chlor-alkali plant (Pereira \n\net al. 1998a, b; Pato et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009a). It is well known that chlor-alkali \n\nindustries using mercury as a cathode are an important source of this hazardous \n\ncontaminant in aquatic environments (Ramalhosa et al., 2005). Since the influence of \n\nanthropogenic mercury in the environment persists for a substantial period of time after \n\nthe reduction of emissions (Pereira, 1996), studies on the impact caused by emissions of \n\nmercury even after the sources have been extinguished are necessary. Mercury\u2019s high \n\nmobility, persistence in the environment, and lipophilicity, justify the importance of the \n\nenvironmental study of mercury, as it is a toxic element to all living organisms \n\n(Boening, 2000).  \n\nSeveral studies have been made to track the mercury discharges in the sediments (Lucas \n\net al., 1986; Hall et al., 1985; Pereira et al., 1998a; Ramalhosa et al., 2001; Ramalhosa \n\net al., 2005; Pastorinho et al., 2012); water (Hall, 1982; Pereira et al., 1998b; \n\nRamalhosa et al., 2001; Pato et al., 2008); organisms (Lima, 1986; Lucas et al., 1986; \n\nAbreu et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2006; Guilherme et al., 2008) and \n\nplants (Coelho et al., 2005; Abreu et al., 2008). In contrast to fish or others organisms, \n\ninformation on Hg in cephalopod tissues is scarce (Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas et al., \n\n2005a,b; Bustamante et al., 2006a; Pierce et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009), which \n\ncontrast once more with the several studies concerning other trace metals in cephalopod \n\ntissues (e.g. Martin and Flegal, 1975; Smith et al., 1984; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; \n\nBustamante et al., 2000, 2002a, b, 2004; Ayas and Ozogul, 2011). Almost all of these \n\nstudies demonstrated the major role of digestive gland in metal metabolism, as this \n\norgan is deeply involved in assimilation processes, detoxification and storage of both \n\nessential and non-essential metals. Only two studies analysed the levels of Hg in \n\ndigestive gland of common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis (Bustamante et al., 2006a; \n\nPereira et al., 2009b). \n\nTherefore, there is a need to provide more data on Hg concentration in digestive gland \n\nand edible tissue of cuttlefish to better estimate the intake of human populations feeding \n\non this cephalopod. Thus, the present study aims at providing baseline data on total Hg \n\nconcentration in the tissues (digestive gland and mantle) of the cuttlefish S. officinalis \n\n(L.) from six sites of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, including areas with variable degrees of \n\ncontamination. In addition to examining spatial and seasonal differences, biological data \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n| P a g e 132 \n\nwas also collected to present a contemporary picture of the distribution of size, maturity, \n\nand sex ratio. \n\n \n\nIV.2. Materials and methods \n\nIV.2.1. Study Area \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro (Figure IV.1), situated \n\non the northern coast of Portugal and with \n\na total area of 83 km\n2\n (high tide) and 66 \n\nKm\n2\n (low tide) (Dias et al., 2001; \n\nAbrantes et al., 2006), supports a \n\npopulation of 350,000 inhabitants (INE, \n\n2001). Its principal municipaly (Aveiro \n\ntown) is located 15 km south from the \n\nindustrial complex of Estarreja, that \n\nincludes a chlor-alkali plant that \n\ndischarged mercury from the 1950s until \n\nthe mid 1990s (Pereira et al., 2009a). The \n\nestimated lagoon tidal prism ranges from \n\n137 x 10\n6\n m\n\n3\n for maximum spring tide \n\nand 35 x 10\n6\n m\n\n3 \nfor minimum neap tide \n\n(Dias et al., 2001). The total mean river \n\ninput into the lagoon during tidal cycle is \n\nsmaller (about 1.8 x 10\n6\n m\n\n3\n) when \n\ncompared with the tidal prism (Lopes and \n\nDias, 2007). Consequently semidiurnal tides \n\nare the major factor influencing the \n\nhydrodynamics of the lagoon (Dias et al., \n\n2000). Laranjo bay is an internal source of Hg by the sediments that have been highly \n\ncontaminated with Hg (Pereira et al., 2009a). Dias (2001) and Lopes et al. (2006) \n\ncharacterized the first half of the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon as ebb \n\ndominated and the second half as flood dominated. As the lower lagoon is ebb \n\ndominated there is a trend to export sediments to the ocean (Picado et al., 2010). Taking \n\nthis in consideration and the several sources of pollution of the lagoon, the following \n\nFigure IV.1- Sampling sites of S. \n\nofficinalis: Ria de Aveiro (Adapted from \n\nValentim et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n   Page | 133  \n\nsites were selected: Barra (BAR), near the entrance of the lagoon in the initial part of \n\nthe Mira channel and subject to considerable vessel traffic; Commercial Port (POR), \n\nwithin the harbour and so with the influence of all the activities developed in the \n\nharbour; Gafanha (GAF) situated in the vicinity of a deep-sea fishing port and dry-\n\ndocks, also connected with the main channel coming from Aveiro city carrying \n\ndomestic discharges; Torreira (TOR), an intermediate region of the longest channel (S. \n\nJacinto-Ovar channel) with influence of Largo da Coroa, considered the second most \n\ncontaminated area after Laranjo bay in Ria de Aveiro; Rio Novo do Principe (RIO) \n\nlocated in the terminal area of the main freshwater course, the Vouga river, 6.5 km \n\ndistant from a paper mill effluent outlet; Laranjo (LAR), in the proximity of the chlor-\n\nalkali plant (6 km), the principal source of metal contamination (mainly mercury). \n\n \n\nIV.2.2. Sampling and biological data collection \n\nFifty three common cuttlefish, S. officinalis (Table IV-I), were caught from March to \n\nDecember 2003, with a fishing net, a network trammel, in five sites of Ria de Aveiro \n\n(Figure IV.1). The abiotic parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, \n\nsalinity, turbidity and depth were registered on each capture. Temperature (\u00b1 0.1 \u00baC) \n\nand dissolved oxygen (\u00b1 0.01 mg.l\n-1\n\n) were recorded with an oxygen meter (Consort \n\nZ621), the pH (\u00b1 0.01) with pH meter (WTW 330/set \u2013 2), the salinity (\u00b1 0.1) with a \n\nrefractometer (Atago), the turbidity (\u00b1 0.1 m) was recorded with a Secchi disc and the \n\ndepth (\u00b1 0.1m) with a handmade probe. Total body weight, dorsal mantle length (DML, \n\nsize), total length (TL), sex and maturity stage were determined in each individual. All \n\nindividuals were included in an allometric relationship between fresh weight (g) and \n\nmantle length (mm) (Figure IV.2). A standard 5-point scale of sexual maturity for S. \n\nofficinalis was used (adapted from Alonso-Allende and Guerra, 1984) (Table A. 1 - \n\nAppendix), in which stage I is \u201cimmature\u201d, stages II-III are \u201cmaturing\u201d, and stages IV-V \n\nare \u201cmature\u201d. Specimens with no visible gonad development were classified as \n\n\u201cJuveniles\u201d (Challier et al., 2002) and allocated in maturity stage 1. The origin, number \n\nof individuals and body weight of each specimen are given in Table IV-I. Specimens \n\nwere stored in individual plastic bags and frozen (-80 \u00baC) in order to minimize \n\nmobilization of metals between organs (Martin and Flegal, 1975). In the laboratory, \n\ndigestive gland and mantle (without skin) were totally removed under partially defrost \n\nconditions without rupture of the tissues. Weight of digestive gland was expressed as \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n| P a g e 134 \n\npercentages of total body weight, e.g., digestive gland index (DGI, see Jorge and Sobral, \n\n2004). After separation, individual tissue samples were freeze-dried, ground and \n\nhomogenised for the analysis of total mercury. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.2 \u2013 Allometric relation between total fresh weight (g) and mantle length (mm) of the S. \n\nofficinalis captured in the Ria de Aveiro. \n\n \n\nTable IV-I \u2013 Characteristics of sampled cuttlefishes. \n\n \n\n* mean \u00b1 standard deviation.

Analytical procedures \n\nTotal Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, using a silicon UV diode \n\ndetector Leco AMA-254, after pyrolysis of each sample in a combustion tube at 750 \u00baC, \n\nunder an oxygen atmosphere and collection on a gold amalgamator (Costley et al., \n\n2000). Mercury analysis were ran with respect to a methodical quality control including \n\nanalysis of international certificate standards dogfish muscle DORM-1, DORM-2; \n\nlobster hepatopancreas TORT-1, TORT-2 and fish liver DOLT-3 purchased to the \n\nNational Research Council, Canada. These certified materials were treated and analysed \n\nunder the same conditions as the samples. The results were in good agreement with the \n\nstandards values, not differing significantly at 95 % confidence level (Table IV-II). \n\nBlanks were also run together with samples. Concentration of metal was expressed in \n\ndry weight (\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWT).

Statistical testing was carried out with MINITAB\u00ae \n\nRelease 14.20. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all tests. Redundancy Analysis \n\n(RDA), a technique that falls between multiple regression and canonical correlation \n\nanalysis (Sparks et al. 1999), was performed using the CANOCO software package for \n\nwindows, version 4.5 to assess effects of environmental conditions on metal content. \n\nThe significance of RDA was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation test using \n\nroutines built into the software package.

Metal in mantle and digestive gland \n\nThe differences in Hg concentrations tended to be slightly higher in the digestive gland \n\nthan in mantle (Table IV-III).

For sex only mantle presented significant differences (p<0.001), in this case \n\nfemales presented higher values of Hg accumulated.

Implications for public health \n\nAccording to COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) N\u00ba 629/2008 of 2 July 2008, the \n\nlimit established for the Hg content in the mantle of cephalopods is 0.5 \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n (fresh \n\nweight) of Hg. Moreover, Portugal has also signed the OSPAR convention, in which it \n\nwas established that the maximum level of mercury in animals for human consumption \n\nis 0.3 \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n wet weight (i.e., 1.5 \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n dry weight) (Seixas et al., 2005b).  \n\nConsidering average of Hg levels in mantle of cuttlefish, the values are significantly \n\nlower than the EU limit (1.5 \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWt) (Figure IV.5). Taking into account all the \n\nresults obtained it was found that only one individual from Laranjo presented a value \n\nhigher (1.6 \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWt) than the limit recommended for human consumption (Figure \n\nIV.5). \n\n \n\n[\nH\n\ng\n]\n u\n\ng\n.g\n\n-\n1\n\nSite\n\nTissue\n\nLARANJOTORREIRARIOGAFANHAPORTOBARRA\n\nDGMDGMDGMDGMDGMDGM\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n| P a g e 140 \n\n \n\nFigure IV.5 \u2013 Comparison between Hg concentration (\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWt) in mantle and the \n\nrecommended limit for human consumption, from different sampling areas. \n\nConsidering the body size of the analysed specimens the ingestion of the digestive gland \n\nis not suppose to occur, for this reason the values obtained for these tissue weren\u2019t \n\ncompared with the EU limit for human consumption.  \n\n \n\nIV.3.3. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) \n\nRDA analysis showed that most of the variance is associated with the first axis (97.4%), \n\nand the remaining part is explained by the second axis (2.6%). Monte Carlo permutation \n\ntests followed the RDA and showed significance for the first axis (p=0.006), thus, \n\ndifferences found in the first axis are significant (Figure IV.6). The significance test of \n\nall canonical axes was also statistically significant (p=0.006).  \n\nThe results of multivariate analysis are comparable to the univariate one (ANOVA), \n\nhowever, the results of the multivariate analysis show more details in individual levels \n\nof Hg in tissues. The RDA focus on the absolute differences in \u2018species\u2019 abundances \n\n(here Hg levels) between the \u2018samples\u2019 (here sites). By the analysis of the RDA triplot \n\nis easily understood that LAR presents the higher values of Hg concentrations and the \n\nrest of the lagoon lower values of Hg concentrations. In terms of environmental \n\nparameters the factor that most interfere with the Hg concentration is the temperature. It \n\nseems that temperature makes the distinction between LAR and the rest of the lagoon. \n\nTemperature is strongly correlated with the first axis (Figure IV.6). \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0.0 500.0 1000.0 1500.0\n\n[H\ng\n\n] \nm\n\na\nn\n\ntl\ne\n\nTotal weight (g)\n\nBAR\n\nGAF\n\nLAR\n\nPOR\n\nRIO\n\nTOR\n\nrecomended limit\n\n \n[H\n\ng\n] \n\nin\n m\n\na\nn\n\ntl\ne\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n   Page | 141  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.6 \u2013 RDA triplot, with focus on site sampling, sampling tissues and environmental \n\nparameters. \n\n \n\nIV.4. Discussion \n\nUnivariate and multivariate methods used in this work are concordant in terms of Hg \n\ndistribution in Ria de Aveiro, and levels of Hg are low with the exception of Laranjo \n\nbay that presented higher values. This fact eliminates a regional distribution of Hg in \n\nRia de Aveiro, the higher levels of Hg are certainly related with the historical discharges \n\nof effluents from the chlor-alkali industry of the industrial complex of Estarreja into \n\nLaranjo bay (Lucas et al., 1986; Hall et al., 1985; Pereira et al., 1998a; Reis et al., 2009; \n\nMonterroso et al., 2003; Pereira et al., 2009a). Today Laranjo bay is a non-significant \n\nactive source of Hg since the discharges stopped in 1985, however, it is still an internal \n\nsource of Hg by the sediments that have been highly contaminated with Hg (Hall et al., \n\n1985). The Hg contained in the sediments may became available to biota (Coelho et al., \n\n2007), eventually from food chain by the benthic organisms (Bryan and Langston, \n\n1992; Lee et al., 1998; Warren et al. 1998), or be remobilized when sediments are \n\ndredged and disposed into water bodies (Newell et al., 1998).

Laranjo presented higher values of \n\ntemperature than other sites, which probably influenced the Hg concentrations, since \n\nhigh temperature favors a high methylation rate (Bustamante et al., 2006a), which could \n\nlead to a higher uptake of mercury by aquatic organisms. Other authors also referred \n\nthat environmental condition, such as levels in water, exposure period, and temperature \n\nmay influence the metal accumulation in cephalopods (Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2000).  \n\nThe cuttlefish Sepia officinalis feeds on a large variety of living prey, including small \n\nmolluscs, crabs, shrimps, other cuttlefish, and juvenile demersal fishes. Schuhmacher et \n\nal. (1994) concluded that the groups that accumulated more Hg are crustaceans and \n\nfishes, that are preferential preys of Cuttlefishes (Pinczon du Sel et al., 2000) Taking \n\ninto account the cephalopods capacity to bioaccumulation (Bustamante et al. 1998b, \n\n2000, 2006a) and that cephalopods have economic importance for humans, the analyse \n\nof Hg levels in Ria de Aveiro is relevant. The levels of mercury in this study were in \n\ngeneral below the acceptable limit for human consumption, only one value of Laranjo \n\nbay was higher than the limit (see Figure IV.5). Levels of Hg obtained in this study \n\nshow that this specie does not constitute a cause of concern in terms of human \n\nconsumption. However, due to the low number of individuals captured in Laranjo bay \n\nand the constant concern with human health, further studies in this area are needed for a \n\nbetter evaluation of the problem. \n\nMercury is considered to be one of the most problematic metals in marine ecosystems \n\ndue to bioaccumulation and biomagnification in marine food webs (EPA, 2001). \n\nVarious studies reported Hg concentrations in different tissues (Alcobia, 1995; Buzina \n\net al., 1989; Stoeppler et al., 1979; Rossi et al., 1993; Seixas et al., 2005a; Raimundo et \n\nal., 2004, 2010; Bustamante et al., 2008). Table IV-V compares Hg concentrations in \n\nmantle and digestive gland of cuttlefish with other cephalopods species. The values \n\nobtained revealed two distinct areas in Ria de Aveiro, the Laranjo bay (polluted area) \n\nwith high concentration of Hg, and the rest of the lagoon as a whole, presenting low \n\nconcentration of Hg. Considering the specie S. officinalis, and comparing only the \n\npolluted areas, the value presented for Laranjo bay is higher than the value of Kastela \n\nbay (polluted). When analysing the unpolluted areas of Ria de Aveiro the value obtained \n\nis higher than those presented on the referred studies. (Table IV-V) Mercury \n\nconcentrations in the lagoon are greatly influenced by the historical discharges of \n\nmercury from industrial activities into Laranjo Bay (Pereira et al., 1998a; Pereira et al., \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n   Page | 143  \n\n2009), leading to Hg concentrations higher than other ecosystems also polluted like \n\nKastela Bay in Adriatic that is known for obtaining discharges of Hg from mine \n\nexploitation of the region (Faganeli et al., 2003).  \n\nConsidering different species, Hg concentrations in this work were always higher with \n\nthe exception of the species (Eledone cirrhosa and Octopus vulgaris) captured in \n\nAdriatic Sea, Mediterranean Sea and specific areas in Portuguese Coast (Cascais and \n\nOlh\u00e3o). Higher Hg concentrations in Mediterranean organisms are typically explained \n\nby high temperature and the absence of solar radiation in the deep environment that \n\nfavours a high methylation rate (Bustamante et al., 2006a). Moreover, natural sources of \n\nHg in the Mediterranean Sea may contribute to Hg enrichment through the benthic food \n\nwebs, as it constitutes the richest natural reserve of this element (Bacci, 1989 in \n\nBustamente et al., 2006a). Geological characteristic such as sulphide deposits of the \n\nIberian Pyrite Belt (Leistel et al., 1998) affect the Hg concentrations of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz (Cossa et al., 2001). Taking into account the mainstream of the Mediterranean \n\nSea and as a result of cyclonic currents in the eastern shelf of the South coast of \n\nPortugal the availability of Hg to local food web can be increased (Garcia-Lafuente and \n\nRuizet, 2006; Relvas et al., 2007). The octopus is a top predator (Mangold, 1983) and \n\nthis could justify the higher concentrations of mercury. These facts could explain the \n\nhigher values obtained for Eledone Cirrhosa and Octopus vulgaris when compared with \n\ncuttlefish of the northwestern coast of Portugal. Like other metals, Hg concentrations in \n\ncephalopod may vary with biological factors such as age (size), sex and maturity stage \n\n(Bustamante et al., 1998a; Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas et al., 2005a; Ayas and \n\nOzogul, 2011). It is generally admitted that Hg concentrations in cephalopod tissues are \n\npositively correlated with size (Monteiro et al., 1992; Rossi et al., 1993; Storelli and \n\nMarcotrigiano, 1999 in Bustamante et al., 2006a), however due to restrict range of size \n\nof captured individuals this couldn\u2019t be verified. It would be extremely interest to invest \n\nmore studies in Ria de Aveiro that includes a higher range of sizes, in order to verify \n\nthis effect of bioaccumulation along life cycle of cuttlefish.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n| P a g e 144 \n\nTable IV-V - Mean \u00b1SD (\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWt) of Hg or Hg concentrations (\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWt) in mantle and \n\ndigestive gland of cephalopods from the literature. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe distribution of Hg was considered between two separated tissues, mantle (muscle) \n\nand digestive gland of S. officinalis. Mantle muscle was first selected taking into \n\naccount that it is referred by several authors (e.g. Renzoni et al., 1973; Monteiro et al., \n\n1992; Seixas et al., 2005a) as a body compartment that could store Hg in significant \n\namounts and also for human health purpose. The second organ, digestive gland, plays a \n\nmajor role in storage and detoxification of several metals. In contrast to what was \n\nobserved for other trace metals, like Ag, Cu, Zn and Cd in previous studies (e.g. \n\nMiramand and Guary, 1980; Finger and Smith, 1987; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; \n\nBustamante et al., 2002a, b, 2004) where concentrations in digestive gland were one or \n\nmore orders of magnitude higher than in other tissues, for Hg the concentrations \n\nrecorded for digestive gland were in the same order of magnitude compared to the \n\nmantle. Such different patterns of accumulation between trace metals and Hg suggest \n\nthat cephalopods have different mechanisms/rates of uptake and/or sequestration of \n\nSpecies Sites Mantle Digestive Authors\n\ngland\n\nSepia officinalis Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) 0.41\u00b10.10 0.66\u00b10.29 Present study\n\nLaranjo Bay, Ria de Aveiro 1.16\u00b10.42 1.98\u00b10.68 Present study\n\nSado estuary (Portugal) 0.10 0.20 Alcobia, 1995\n\nKastela Bay (Adriatic) unpolluted 0.24 - Buzina et al., 1989\n\nKastela Bay (Adriatic) polluted 0.48 - Buzina et al ., 1989\n\nLa Spezia (Mediterranean) 0.34 - Stoeppler et al ., 1979\n\nMaddalena (Mediterranean) 0.20 - Stoeppler et al ., 1979\n\nChioggia 0.16 - Stoeppler et al ., 1979\n\nCeuta 0.13 - Stoeppler et al ., 1979\n\nScheveningen 0.08 - Stoeppler et al ., 1979\n\nArchiteuthis dux Bay of Biscay - 0.47\u00b10.13 Bustamante et al ., 2008\n\nMediterranean - 1.56 Bustamante et al ., 2008\n\nEledone Cirrhosa Mediterranean Sea 1.00-6.02 - Rossi et al., 1993\n\nLoligo vulgaris Kastela Bay (Adriatic) unpolluted 0.26 - Buzina et al ., 1989\n\nKastela Bay (Adriatic) polluted 0.32 - Buzina et al ., 1989\n\nOctopus vulgaris Adriatic Sea 2.70\u00b11.20 1.50\u00b11.0 Storelli et al ., 2006\n\nViana (Portugal) 0.27\u00b10.04 0.58\u00b10.08 Seixas et al .,2005a\n\nCascais (Portugal) 0.48\u00b10.16 3.43\u00b12.57 Seixas et al .,2005a\n\nPortuguese coast 0.31\u00b10.12 2.60\u00b14.30 Raimundo et al., 2004\n\nMatosinhos (Portugal) 0.28\u00b10.14 0.86\u00b10.54 Raimundo et al., 2010\n\nCascais (Portugal) 0.60\u00b10.20 1.80\u00b11.10 Raimundo et al., 2010\n\nOlh\u00e3o (Portugal) 0.35\u00b10.04 5.10\u00b11.50 Raimundo et al., 2010\n\nKastela Bay (Adriatic) 0.52 - Buzina et al ., 1989\n\nMediterranean Sea 0.44-1.38 4.61-60.56 Renzoni et al .,1973\n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n   Page | 145  \n\nthese metals (Pierce et al., 2008). This contrast between trace metals and Hg \n\npartitioning was also observed in other cephalopods (Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas et \n\nal., 2005a; Bustamante et al., 2006a).  \n\nSources of metal contamination in cephalopods are seawater, as it passes through the \n\nskin and through the gills; and diet, which probably represents the main pathway for \n\nmany elements, as previously shown for Cd and Zn (Bustamante et al., 2002b, 2004, \n\n2006b; Miramand et al., 2006). Despite the comparable concentration of Hg, the \n\ndigestive gland presented in all sites a higher value than mantle (see Table IV-III), \n\nwhich strongly suggests that food is a major source for mercury accumulation in \n\ncuttlefish. Due to the positive correlation between Hg concentrations in mantle and \n\ndigestive gland (Figure IV.3), and the fact that muscular tissues contained most of the \n\nbody\u2019s burden of mercury, which suggests a translocation of Hg from digestive gland \n\n(Seixas et al., 2005a; Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009). The small difference between \n\nlevels of Hg in mantle and digestive gland could be explained by the affinity of mantle \n\nto storage MeHg, that is the predominant form of Hg stored in muscle tissue (Harris et \n\nal., 2003; Amlund et al., 2007). However, compared to other metals like Cd, the role of \n\ndigestive gland in storage of Hg appears to be relatively limited. This may be due to an \n\nexcretion function of Hg by the digestive gland (Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009), and a \n\npreferential redistribution of Hg to muscular tissues where it bound to the sulfhydryl \n\ngroups of proteins (Bustamante et al., 2006a). \n\n \n\nIV.5. Conclusions \n\nThe study provided new data on one of the most problematic contaminant in marine \n\necosystems, mercury, in edible tissue and digestive gland of the commonly eaten S. \n\nofficinalis from Portugal, and clearly demonstrated that levels of mercury in Ria de \n\nAveiro lagoon do not constitute a risk to human health. Actually the increment of \n\ntemperature concentrated the contaminants in the aquatic environment and the known \n\npresence of historical anthropogenic discharges of mercury from a chlor-alkali plant \n\nnear this site lead to a higher accumulation of Hg in S. officinalis specie in Laranjo bay. \n\nHowever, further and wider scale study would be valuable, especially in a restricted \n\npolluted area, Laranjo. Taking into account that organic form of Hg is the most toxic, it \n\nwould be interesting in future studies to measure MeHg, when aiming to evaluate the \n\nrisk for human consumption. In the same way, supplementary analysis concerning Hg \n\n\n\nChapter IV  \n\n| P a g e 146 \n\nlevels are needed to really understand the apparent limited role of digestive gland in \n\nstorage and detoxification of this element when compared with others trace elements \n\nlike Cd and Zn. Observed seasonal and spatial variations indicate that cuttlefish can be \n\nused to monitor the Hg levels in the environment. \n\n \n\nIV.6. References \n\nAbrantes, I., Dias, J., Rocha, F. (2006).

Abstract \n\nThe developmental changes in the concentration of 6 (essential and non-essential) \n\nmetals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Hg) in two tissues (digestive gland and mantle) of the \n\ncommon cuttlefish Sepia officinalis caught in Ria de Aveiro were analysed from the \n\nstage I to Stage IV of maturation. No differences between sexes were identified in the \n\nfour stages of maturity. After the immature individuals start to feed, the digestive gland \n\nappears to play a major role in the storage of all metals with the exception of Hg. Metal \n\nconcentration of Zn and Cd in digestive gland increases with age during the life cycle of \n\ncuttlefish, Pb decreases from the stage I of maturity to the rest of the stages. Hg \n\npresented a positive correlation with age, however, unlike other metals, this correlation \n\nwas observed in the mantle and not in the digestive gland, which suggests that the \n\ncapacity of digestive gland to storage this metal is limited. However, digestive gland has \n\na major role in Hg detoxification and depuration. The essential metals Fe and Cu \n\ndisplayed a homogeneous concentration of metal during growth of cuttlefish which \n\nrevealed the regular balance of these metals. For the entire life cycle of cuttlefish the \n\nconcentrations of essential metals were always higher than concentrations of non-\n\nessential metals. The results highlighted the strong capacity of cuttlefish to storage in its \n\ntissues essential and non-essential metals in different stages of its life cycle, suggesting \n\nthat Sepia officinalis could be considered good specie for toxicological studies.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter V  \n\n| P a g e 160 \n\nV.2. Introduction \n\nThe cuttlefish Sepia officinalis has a very short life cycle, during which migrations \n\nrelated to growth and reproduction take place (Miramand et al., 2006). In Ria de Aveiro \n\nas in the English Channel and in other Atlantic inshore areas, the reproductive season, \n\nafter which these organisms die, occurs between April and September of their second \n\nyear of life, when they are aged between 14 and 18 months (Boyle, 1990; Boucaud-\n\nCarnou et al., 1991; Legoff and Daguzan, 1991; Dias et al., in press). Consequently, the \n\nlife of cuttlefish never exceeds 2 years in these areas (Richard, 1971; Boletzky, 1983). \n\nThis extremely high growth rate of the cuttlefish is due to their high feeding rates, \n\ncharacteristic of cephalopods, moreover food has often been cited as the main uptake \n\npathway of metal contamination in cephalopods (Martin and Flegal, 1975; Bustamante \n\net al., 1998b; Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009). \n\nCuttlefish is initially benthopelagic but subsequently is mostly benthic, however this \n\nspecie spend long periods buried into sediment (Nixon and Mangold, 1998). Sediment \n\nrepresents the main sink for pollutants in coastal ecosystems that are impacted by \n\nanthropogenic activities (Fichet et al., 1999). Potentially toxic compounds, especially \n\nmetals, are adsorbed on the mineral or organic particles, either in their organic or \n\ninorganic forms (Robbe, 1984 in Fichet et al., 1999). Taking this into account, the \n\ncontamination via sediment must be considered for the early stages of the cuttlefish life \n\ncycle, and the contamination via water in the embryogenic stage, since this stage occurs \n\nin direct contact with water and the animal only feeds from the reserves of the egg. As \n\nthe principal via of contamination changes along the cuttlefish life cycle, it is expected \n\nthat the patterns of metal accumulation also change during the growth and development \n\nof juveniles into adult cuttlefishes. In general, after the hatching, accumulation of toxic \n\nelements shows two patterns: metals such as Ag, which is accumulated immediately \n\nsince juveniles, are in direct contact with seawater, and metals as Cd and Pb which are \n\nsignificantly incorporate only once the cephalopods start to feed (Miramand et al., \n\n2006).  \n\nDespite the short life cycle of S. officinalis, several studies have demonstrated the \n\nefficiency of cuttlefish as accumulators of various trace metals in their tissues, and also \n\nthat the digestive gland acts as the principal organ in the bioaccumulation processes \n\n(Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 1998a; Bustamante et al., 2002a,b), \n\nwith the exception of Hg where the digestive gland has a major role in Hg detoxification \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n   Page | 161  \n\n \n\nand depuration, being limited it\u2019s capacity for storage this element (Lacoue-Labarthe et \n\nal., 2009). Other authors studied the accumulation of metals in the early stages and \n\nduring the growth of cuttlefish (Bustamante et al., 2002b; Bustamante et al., 2004; \n\nBustamante et al., 2006b; Miramand et al., 2006; Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009), \n\nhowever only one of these studies is from organisms captured in is natural environment \n\n(Miramand et al., 2006). Overall, there is a lack of published data concerning the \n\naccumulation of essential and non-essential metals in juvenile cuttlefish captured in the \n\nwild and subject to the natural conditions of the environment. Such baseline information \n\nis needed to better understand the necessities and the processes of accumulation of trace \n\nmetals along the cuttlefish life cycle. The main aim of this study is to understand the \n\nseasonal and spatial changes in metal concentrations during the growth, life cycle of S. \n\nofficinalis, for those 6 metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Hg) investigated from immature \n\nto adult cuttlefish, in Ria de Aveiro. This \n\ninvestigation focused on S. officinalis, due to its \n\nwide distribution in coastal waters and high \n\ncommercial importance in Portugal. \n\n \n\nV.3. Materials and methods \n\nV.3.1. Study Area \n\nRia the Aveiro ia a shallow well-mixed (marine \n\nand freshwater) coastal lagoon on the northwester \n\ncoast of Portugal (40\u00b038\u00b4N, 8\u00b044\u00b4W) connected to \n\nthe sea by a single channel (1.3 Km long, 350 m \n\nwide and 20 m deep). (Dias and Fernandes, 2006; \n\nAbrantes et al., 2006). The system can be \n\nsubdivided into channels that, due to specific \n\ncharacteristics, can be regarded as independent \n\nestuaries connected to a common outlet. In \n\ngeneral, the most common typology is one of \n\nextensive intertidal zones, namely mud flats and \n\nsalt marshes, with the exception of the central part \n\nof the lagoon (Picado et al., 2010; Pastorinho et \n\nFigure V.1 - Sampling station of S. \n\nofficinalis in Ria de Aveiro (Adapted \n\nfrom Valentim et al., 2013) \n\n\n\nChapter V  \n\n| P a g e 162 \n\nal., 2012). The hydrodynamic pattern of the lagoon is imposed by tide, each channel \n\npossesses its own hydrodymanics influence by the respective tidal prism, amount of \n\nfreshwater input and wind force. Strongest currents are observed at the inlet channel, \n\nreaching values higher than 2 m/s (Vaz et al., 2009). The bathymetry shows that Ria de \n\nAveiro is a very shallow lagoon (average depth of 3 m). The deepest areas of the lagoon \n\nare confined to the inlet channel and to small areas close to the lagoon mouth, at its \n\nwestern boundary, where the depths may reach values of 20 m. In the navigation \n\nchannels, that are frequently dredged, the depths are about 7 m (Lopes and Dias, 2007).  \n\n \n\nV.3.2. Sampling and biological data collection \n\nA total of 68 cuttlefishes were analysed, and the concentrations of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), \n\ncooper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) were determined. Cuttlefish, \n\nSepia officinalis, was caught monthly during March 2003 to December 2003 with a \n\nnetwork trammel and in two periods corresponding to spring and summer with a \n\ntraditional beach-seine named \u201cchincha\u201d. The use of two types of gears was to ashore \n\nthe capture of individuals of a wide range of sizes and consequently, individuals from \n\nimmature stage (\u201cchincha\u201d) to adult stage (network trammel). Sampling was conducted \n\nin a single site of the Ria de Aveiro, Barra (BAR), corresponding to the initial part of \n\nthe Mira channel, close to the entrance of the lagoon and subject to considerable vessel \n\ntraffic (Figure V.1). The choice of the sampling site took into account several factors: \n\nsite of easy and safe access for sampling; area subjected to regular dredging, which \n\nleads to large variations in the concentration of suspended sediments and consequently, \n\nincreasing the availability of contaminants resuspended in water column; and also an \n\narea used by local fisherman to capture cuttlefish. Abiotic parameters (water \n\ntemperature (\u00baC); dissolved oxygen (mg/L); turbidity (m); pH; salinity) were assessed \n\naccording APHA (1998) guidelines (Table V-I). For all the cuttlefishes, dorsal mantle \n\nlength (DML) (mm), wet weight (WWt) (g), sex, and maturity stage were recorded \n\n(Table V-II). A standard 5-point scale of sexual maturity for S. officinalis was used \n\n(adapted from Alonso-Allende and Guerra, 1984), in which stage I is \u201cimmature\u201d, \n\nstages II-III are \u201dmaturing\u201d, and stages IV-V are \u201cmature\u201d. Specimens with no visible \n\ngonad development were classified as \u201cjuveniles\u201d (Challier et al., 2002) and allocated to \n\nmaturity stage I (Table V-II).Specimens were stored in individual plastic bags and \n\nimmediately frozen, in order to minimize mobilization of metals between organs \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n   Page | 163  \n\n(Martin and Flegal, 1975). In the laboratory, the digestive gland of each specimens was \n\ntotally removed under defrost conditions without rupture of outer membrane. Mantle \n\nfree from skin and inner membrane was also sampled. Tissues samples were weighted, \n\nfrozen at \u2013 80 \u00b0C and homogenized.  \n\nTable V-I \u2013 Abiotic parameters (average\u00b1SD) of the water from the Ria de Aveiro sampling \n\nseason. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable V-II \u2013 Size, sex (F (?) and M (?)) and maturity stage in sampled S. officinalis, for each \n\nsampling season. \n\n \n\n \n\nFor dorsal mantle length (DML), the table shows the average\u00b1standard deviation.

(1990). All \n\nlaboratory ware was cleaned with HNO3 (20%) for 2 days and rinsed with Milli-Q water \n\nto avoid contamination. The selection of the analytical methodology and apparatus to \n\nuse in metal quantification was determined by metal concentration present in the tissues. \n\nQuantification of Fe, Zn and Cu in mantle and digestive gland and Cd in digestive gland \n\nwas performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer Analyst 100) \n\nwhile quantification of Cd in mantle and Pb in the mantle and digestive gland were \n\nanalysed with ICP-MS.

The analysed \n\ndata included specimens from different sizes and weights over wide ranges, and also \n\nincluded individuals of both sex (M (?) and F (?)) (Table V-II). The relationships \n\nbetween size and weight of all analysed cuttlefishes presented a typically allometric \n\ncurve (Figure V.2). \n\n \n\nFigure V.2 - Allometric relation between total wet weight (g) and mantle length (mm) of the S. \n\nofficinalis captured in the Ria de Aveiro, making reference to de maturity stage of each specimen \n\n(stage I \u2013 Immature; stage II and III \u2013 Maturing and stage IV \u2013 Mature). \n\n \n\nWeight and length present a strong correlation, with proportional increase over growth. \n\nThe correlation was very significant (p<0.001) and Pearson correlation of 0.995.

For mantle there was no significant differences (p<0.05; F1, \n\n65=2.22) associated with sex, thus for the rest of the analysis the individuals were \n\nconsidered all together. Highly significant (p<0.001) differences between seasons \n\n(spring and summer) were detected for Zn and Hg concentrations. Levels of Zn and Hg \n\nwere higher in animals captured during the spring season (Table V-V).  \n\n \n\nTable V-IV \u2013 DML: Dorsal mantle length (average\u00b1SD; mm), n: number of individuals analysed, \n\nMetal concentrations (average\u00b1SD; \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n DWt) in mantle and digestive gland of Sepia officinalis \n\nsampled in Ria de Aveiro at different stages of its life cycle. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe tissue type (mantle and digestive gland) had a highly significant (p<0.001) \n\ninfluence on the accumulation of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb being one or two orders of \n\nmagnitude higher than in mantle (Table V-IV). Like for mantle, in digestive gland there \n\nwas no significant difference (p<0.05) between metal accumulation with sex. Only Zn \n\nand Cd concentrations presented significant differences (p<0.001) between seasons \n\n(spring and summer).

As expected the \n\nconcentrations of the essential metals (Fe, Zn, and Cu) were much higher than the non-\n\nessential metals (Cd, Pb and Hg) and the mean values of metals analysed, for digestive \n\ngland, were in the following order: Zn>Fe>Cu>>Cd>Pb>Hg (Table V-IV and Table \n\nV-V).

Discussion \n\nThe strong correlation between length and weight is principally due to environment. \n\nCuttlefishes in the different stages of their life cycle are subjected to different conditions \n\nin the environment, since they are migratory species, and as we known changes in the \n\nabiotic parameters can interfere with the process of maturation of the individual. \n\nMost of the studies that focus on the metal bioaccumulation in cephalopods are related \n\nto a single organ, mainly the digestive gland known to play a major role in the energetic \n\nmetabolism of cephalopods. These works although limited to a restrict number of \n\ncephalopod species have highlighted that this organ is deeply involved in the \n\nmetabolism of Zn, Cu and Cd (Martin and Flegal, 1975; Smith et al., 1984; Finger and \n\nSmith, 1987; Miramand and Guary, 1980; Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2002a). Metal \n\nconcentrations in mantle and digestive gland of S. officinalis along several maturity \n\nstages (Stage I, II, III and IV) analysed showed distinct levels of bioaccumulation for \n\nboth tissues. \n\nIndeed, the mean concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in the digestive gland are \n\nmuch higher than the mean concentrations of those metals in mantle. In contrast, for Hg \n\nthe concentrations obtained for the digestive gland were higher than in mantle but of the \n\nMetals Factors F\nSignificance\n\n(p value)\nConclusions F\n\nSignificance\n\n(p value)\nConclusions\n\nSeason F1, 66=0.25 P=0.62 NS F1, 66=0.00 P=0.94 NS\n\nMaturity stage F3, 64=0.66 P=0.58 NS F3, 64=2.20 P=0.097 NS\n\nSeason F1, 66=25.07&lt;0.001 (S) spring?summer F1, 66=55.23&lt;0.001 (S) spring?summer\n\nMaturity stage F3, 64=32.78 0.019 (S) I?IV F3, 64=19.18&lt;0.001 (S) I?II=IV=III\n\nSeason F1, 66=0.32 P=0.57 NS F1, 66=3.65 P=0.61 NS\n\nMaturity stage F3, 63=1.17 P=0.33 NS F3, 64=2.14 P=0.104 NS\n\nSeason F1, 66=1,49 P=0.23 NS F1, 66=36.99&lt;0.001 (S) spring?summer\n\nMaturity stage F3, 64=0.06 P=0.98 NS F1, 46=7.37 0.009 (S) I=II?III?IV\n\nSeason F1, 65=1.66 P=0.203 NS F1, 66=3.95 P=0.051 NS\n\nMaturity stage F3, 64=2.68 P=0.054 NS F3, 64=3.13 0.032 (S) II?I\n\nSeason F1, 66=3.58&lt;0.001 (S) spring?summer F1, 66=0.19 P=0.67 NS\n\nMaturity stage F3, 64=24.10&lt;0.001 (S) I?III=IV F3, 64=2.04 P=0.12 NS\n\nPb\n\nHg\n\nMantle Digestive Gland\n\nFe\n\nZn\n\nCu\n\nCd\n\n\n\nChapter V  \n\n| P a g e 170 \n\nsame order of magnitude. Consequently, and in accordance to Miramand et al., 2006, \n\nthe digestive gland generally contained a great proportion of the whole-body burden of \n\nthe metals with the exception of Hg (Bustamante et al., 2006a). \n\nSeveral authors refer that mantle is a tissue with strong capacity for storage large \n\namounts of Hg (Renzoni et al., 1973; Monteiro et al., 1992; Seixas et al., 2005). Such a \n\ndifferent pattern of accumulation between Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb analysed and Hg \n\nsuggest that cuttlefish has different mechanisms of uptake or sequestration of these \n\nmetals (Pierce et al., 2008). This difference was also observed for other authors like: \n\nRaimundo et al. (2004); Seixas et al. (2005); Bustamante et al. (2006a). This may be \n\ndue to an excretion function of Hg associated with the digestive gland (Lacoue-Labarthe \n\net al., 2009), and a preferential redistribution of Hg to muscular tissues as \n\nmethylmercury (MeHg) (Bustamante et al., 2006a). \n\nThe embryonic development of nautiluses, cuttlefishes, squids and cirrate octopods \n\noccur in an eggs protected by a capsule whose thickness varies according to the species \n\n(Villanueva and Bustamante, 2006). Inside the egg of cuttlefish, concentrations of non-\n\nessential elements, as Ag, Cd and Pb, remains very low, which suggest a restrict transfer \n\nof these metals through the eggshell during the embryonic development (Miramand and \n\nBentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 2002b, 2004; Miramand et al., 2006). Moreover, eggs \n\nof cirrate octopods (en ex., O. vulgaris) lacks eggshell and the chorion is in direct \n\ncontact with seawater. Taking this into account O. vulgaris eggs have higher \n\nconcentrations for most of the essential elements and also for some of the non-essentials \n\n(i.e., Ag and Pb). This difference with encased eggs could be due to the absorption of \n\nthese elements from the seawater during the embryonic development in O. vulgaris \n\n(Villanueva and Bustamante, 2006). Collected data are in agreement with these facts, \n\nindeed, Zn, Cd and Hg presented higher concentrations in mature stages than in \n\nimmature stages. However, the most striking result was the extremely high value of Pb \n\nin the digestive gland of immature specimens. This aspect can be related with the source \n\nof intake of this metal. To the best of our knowledge, no data on the respective \n\nproportions of elements incorporated from food and seawater has been published for \n\ncephalopods. So, two possibilities were considered for this value, the food ingested by \n\nimmature specimens was probably highly contaminated by Pb or the specimens were \n\nsubjected to an acute exposition and recent uptake of Pb by seawater. On these \n\nimmature specimens, being on an early stage of maturation, the digestive gland may not \n\nbe working properly, leading only to the accumulation of metal and not to its \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n   Page | 171  \n\ndetoxification. The decrease observed for the second stage of maturity reinforces this \n\nidea (Figure V.3). Further investigations on the uptake of Pb are needed to assess this \n\nhypothesis. It was shown (Miramand et al. 2006) that embryos present very low metal \n\nconcentrations compared to older cuttlefish, and that concentrations of embryos were \n\nclose or even identical to those measured in the vitellus of newly spawned eggs, which \n\nsuggests that the vitellus contains a sufficient amount of essential metals (Cu, Fe, and \n\nZn) needed for the development of the embryos. Considering the classification for \n\ncuttlefish age (Miramand et al. 2006), the immature cuttlefishes here analysed have 1 to \n\n2 months, and so have already started to feed. Food is the major source of essential \n\nelements such as Cu, Fe and Zn (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002b), which \n\nhave low concentrations in seawater, and digestive gland acts in the regulation of Fe, Zn \n\nand Cu. Despite dietary intakes, the concentrations of Fe and Cu in analysed tissues did \n\nnot vary significantly among cuttlefish life cycle (Table V-IV) and only Zn showed a \n\nsignificant increase of the concentration in the analysed tissues (Figure V.3). This could \n\nbe due to mechanisms of homeostatic regulation (Miramand et al., 2006).  \n\nIn digestive gland, Zn presented a significant increase (p<0.05) from stage I (243\u00b1112 \n\n\u00b5g g\n-1\n\n.DWT) to stage II (578\u00b1270 \u00b5g g\n-1\n\n.DWT) (Figure V.3), stage I are increased 2.4 \n\ntimes compared to stage II. This increase between immature and juveniles could be due \n\nto differences in efficiency of their digestive metabolism (Mangold, 1989 in Bustamante \n\net al., 2002b). Regardless of being non-significant (p>0.05) Zn concentration in \n\ndigestive gland almost doubled from stage II (immature adults) to stage III (pre-\n\nposture), this fact might be related to metal physiological changes during sexual \n\nmaturation as reported for S. officinalis from the English Channel (Miramand et al., \n\n2006). In contrast, the decrease of Zn from stage III (pre-posture) to stage IV (posture) \n\nmay result from higher metabolic requirements in immature individuals to reach \n\nmaturation (Bustamante et al., 2002a,b). \n\nThe digestive gland plays a major role in the energetic metabolism of cephalopods \n\n(Boucaud-Camou and Boucher-Rodoni, 1983 in Bustamante et al., 2006a) and is known \n\nfor accumulating metal in large amounts (Martin and Flegal, 1975; Finger and Smith, \n\n1987; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 2000), especially for Cd (Figure \n\nV.4 and Figure V.3). Indeed, during the life cycle of cuttlefish, specifically between \n\nstage I and stage IV, Cd concentrations increased 14 times compared to a factor of 2 for \n\nmantle. Cd is strongly retained in the tissue of adult cuttlefishes and this increased \n\nretention capacity occurs almost exclusively in the digestive gland. Several authors \n\n\n\nChapter V  \n\n| P a g e 172 \n\nreported that the digestive gland play a primary role in the accumulation of Cd in \n\ncuttlefish (Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002a). \n\nThus, assimilated Cd that is contained in the digestive gland may be considered as \n\nactually stored. The lower retention efficiency for Cd noted in immature cuttlefish \n\nwould result from the incomplete development of the digestive gland in early juveniles \n\n(Bustamante et al., 2002b) and a restrict transfer of this non-essential metal from food \n\nin earlier stages. Cephalopods such as Sepia officinalis accumulate Cd mainly from diet \n\n(Bustamante et al., 2002a,b). \n\nCephalopods are carnivorous, active predators and because they have very high feedings \n\nrates, most part of the metals can be assumed to be incorporated via food (Villanueva \n\nand Bustamante, 2006). Intake pathways also take place from seawater, as it occurs for \n\nAg (Bustamante et al., 2004, Miramand et al., 2006). However, for all metals (including \n\nHg) there are three possible sources of intake: water (Bustamante et al., 2006a), food \n\n(Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009) and sediments (Miramand et al., 2006). Nonetheless, it \n\nhas been reported that Hg is mainly accumulated from food, contributing to almost 80% \n\nof the global metal bioaccumulation (Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009). Mercury is known \n\nfor is capacity of bioaccumulate in marine organisms (Baeyers et al., 2003; Bustamante \n\net al., 2006a). The results obtained in this work highlighted this capacity, in fact Hg \n\nconcentration increased significantly (Table V-V and Figure V.3) along the life cycle of \n\ncuttlefish, presenting an increment of 2 times between stage I and Stage IV. \n\n \n\nV.6. Conclusions \n\nComparison of metal concentrations in different maturity stages of cuttlefish show that \n\ncephalopods may accumulate differently along life cycle depending on physiological \n\nchanges and also the characteristics of the analysed element. The results allowed the \n\ndetermination of three distinct groups of metals: the ones where the accumulated value \n\ndecreased along the life cycle, as Pb; those where the accumulation increased in the \n\ntissues with growth (Zn, Cd and Hg); and finally, the metals that remained constant \n\nalong growth, like Fe and Cu. Essential metal (Fe, Zn and Cu) always presented higher \n\nvalues than non-essential metals (Cd, Pb and Hg) regardless of the maturity stage of the \n\nspecimen. The main stages of its life are punctuated by important seasonal migrations \n\nbetween shallow waters in summer and deeper waters in winter (Gauvrit et al., 1997). \n\nThese migrations may modify the bioaccumulation processes of metals, whereas during \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n   Page | 173  \n\nthe migrations the animals move from coastal areas (with metallic inputs of \n\nanthropogenic origin) to offshore (presumably less polluted than the coast) (Miramand \n\net al., 2006). For a better understanding of the accumulation process of metals during \n\nthe life cycle of cuttlefish, further research focusing these migrations are needed to \n\nimprove our knowledge. Indeed, it would be very important to capture cuttlefish before \n\nthe entrance in the Ria de Aveiro to obtain metal concentrations without anthropogenic \n\npollution sources that exist within the lagoon. \n\n \n\nV.7.

General Discussion and Conclusions \n\nThis study focus on the distribution patterns, the biology and some reproductive aspects \n\nof the life cycle of cuttlefish specie in Ria de Aveiro (chapter I). Due to the importance \n\nof cuttlefish, in diet and local economy of Aveiro region, the accumulation of some \n\nessential (Fe, Cu and Zn) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) metals in two target tissues \n\n(mantle and digestive gland) was studied (chapter II). Due to its extreme toxicity, strong \n\ncapacity to persist in aquatic ecosystems and to the historical discharges of the chlor-\n\nalkali industry in Ria de Aveiro, mercury levels, in mantle and digestive gland, were \n\nstudied separately from other mentioned metals in chapter III. Other demanding aspect \n\nwas to investigate the patterns of accumulation of all above mentioned metals (Fe, Cu, \n\nZn, Cd, Pb and Hg) as well as their seasonal variation with age in chapter IV.  \n\nCuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is an economically important target specie for Portuguese \n\nfisheries (Serrano, 1992), namely for Ria de Aveiro (Docapesca \u2013 Statistical \n\nDepartment, 2013). This work was performed at Ria de Aveiro (Aveiro lagoon) that is \n\ncharacterized by a large number of other smaller channels between which lie significant \n\nintertidal areas, essentially mudflats, salt marshes and old salt pans (Picado et al., 2010). \n\nAveiro Lagoon is affected by a vast number of anthropogenic pressures: a) population \n\nsettlement, the municipalities encircling this system are populated by 350,000 \n\ninhabitants (INE, 2011); b) industries (chemical, metallurgic, ceramics, tannery and \n\npulp milling (Pacheco et al., 2005); c) agriculture and cattle rearing (Vasconcelos et al., \n\n2007); c) offshore fisheries and fish and shellfish capture inside the lagoon (Pastorinho \n\net al., 2012); d) the sizeable number of abandoned mines draining to the Vouga River or \n\nits tributaries (Delgado et al. 2000). Anthropogenic factors affect water quality and also \n\ninfluence the recruitment of several species in the lagoon (especially the migratory \n\nspecies like cuttlefish). Historical discharges of industrial and domestic effluents in Ria \n\nde Aveiro (Hall, 1982; Pereira et al., 2009a), for many years, affected the community of \n\naquatic individuals that live in the wide diversity of characteristic habitats of this \n\naquatic systems (Pombo and Rebelo, 2002). \n\nSeveral factors should be considered when studying the distribution of organisms such \n\nas seasonality, catchment size, estuary size and type, habitat type, near shore marine \n\nconditions, physical constrictions, the occurrence and severity of floods, salinity \n\ngradients, the ability of species to adjust to salinity and temperature fluctuations, \n\ndissolved oxygen levels, turbidity, food availability, predation, competition, \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X11000257#bib0240\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X11000257#bib0300\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X11000257#bib0300\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n| P a g e 182 \n\nreproductive conditions and habitat degradation (pollution and dredging) (Whitfield, \n\n1996). Some of these factors cannot be achieved under field conditions, and in this \n\nstudy, abiotic factors like water temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH and \n\nsalinity were measured to comprehend cuttlefish distribution in Ria the Aveiro. Among \n\nthe five factors studied, the two factors that seemed to be relevant to determine the \n\npresence or the absence of cuttlefish in the lagoon were the salinity and depth. \n\nSalinity fluctuations in Ria the Aveiro depend mainly upon the balance between \n\nfreshwater inflow and the tidal regime, with evaporation playing a major role in lagoon \n\nsystems with a large surface area. The results obtained in this work suggest that, the \n\ncuttlefishes in Ria the Aveiro are therefore more tolerant to higher than lower salinity \n\nconditions, which is in close agreement with values obtained for optimum embryonic \n\ndevelopment and growth of young cuttlefish (36-37), under aquaculture conditions \n\n(Domingues et al., 2001; Domingues et al., 2004; Baeza-Rojano et al., 2010). Indeed, \n\nthe entrance of cuttlefish in the lagoon may delay or suffer an interruption due to the \n\npresence of freshwater (Jorge and Sobral, 2004). This is relevant because within the \n\nlagoon some areas are affected by freshwater flooding (especially the sites near the \n\nmain rivers) and others by marine tides, whereas salinity is typically of marine \n\nenvironments.  \n\nAre\u00e3o (ARE), the site without cuttlefishes, is the site located further away from the sea, \n\nso exhibits only minor tidal effects and also receives freshwater from lagoons (located \n\nto the South) through a system of ditches whose input is calculated as 1.9 m\n3\n s\n\n-1\n \n\n(Rodrigues et al. 2009), both factors contribute to a very low salinity. This site presents \n\nthe lower limits of salinity and depth, what may justify the absence of cutlefish. \n\nMarine tide regulates the salinity in Aveiro lagoon but also influences the depth of sites, \n\nmainly the sites near the mouth of the lagoon. Indeed the sites that presented the highest \n\nvalues of depth were POR, SJA and GAF, all near the sea.  \n\nThe abiotic characteristics observed seem to favor the colonization of the lagoon by \n\ncuttlefish, practically throughout the year, although with marked fluctuations in \n\nabundance.  \n\nS. officinalis reproduces only once, over a short period at the end of its life (Mangold, \n\n1963). One of the most important characteristic of its life cycle is the seasonal \n\nmigrations between shallow waters in summer and deeper waters waters in winter \n\n(Gauvrit et al., 1997). Cuttlefish live approximately two years and exhibit mass \n\nmortality of adults after spawning period (Boletzky, 1983). Abiotic parameters such as \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n   Page | 183  \n\nsalinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc., affect the development of the \n\nSepia officinalis in its life cycle (Richard, 1971; Palmegiano and D\u2019apote, 1983; \n\nBouchaud and Daguzan, 1990; Domingues et al., 2001). Temperature clearly plays a \n\nmajor role in determining the life span of S. officinalis (Richard, 1971; Forsythe et al. \n\n1991, 1994). \n\nThe life cycle of cuttlefish in Ria de Aveiro starts with the entrance of adults entering \n\nreproduction period in spring. The reproduction peak is reached in summer, when water \n\ntemperature begins to increase, and apparently ends with the death of post-spawning \n\nindividuals and later in autumn with the return of new borned cuttlefish to sea. This \n\nstructure of reproductive life cycle presented in the Ria de Aveiro is in accordance to \n\nothers geographical areas, like the English Channel (Dunn, 1999; Wang et al., 2003 and \n\nChallier et al., 2005); the Estuary of Sado in Set\u00fabal (Portugal) (Neves et al., 2009) and \n\nthe French coast (Morbihan Bay) (Blanc et al., 1998).  \n\nThe length of mature individuals caught in Ria de Aveiro suggests that cuttlefish \n\nbreeders were in their first year of life. The energy required for the sexual development \n\nof males and females of cuttlefish is quite different (Dunn, 1999). Males attain sexual \n\nmaturity earlier than females (Gauvrit et al., 1997) being usually smaller than females \n\n(Pinczon-du-Sel and Daguzan, 1997). These facts explain the significant differences \n\nbetween weight-length relationships of different sexes in cuttlefish. Richard (1971) and \n\nBoletzky (1979) showed that reared cuttlefish growth was sigmoid. Forsythe and Van \n\nHeukelem (1987) described a two \u2013 phase curve, with an exponential phase followed by \n\na logarithmic phase.  \n\nCephalopods are known for their ability to accumulate high levels of essential elements \n\nand non-essential elements (Martin and Flegal, 1975; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; \n\nBustamante et al., 1998a, b; Bustamante et al., 2000; Raimundo et al., 2004). \n\nConsidering these two facts, the historical problem of pollution of Ria de Aveiro and the \n\nstrong capacity of cuttlefish to accumulate exogenous compounds, this study tried to \n\nunderstand the patterns of metal accumulation in S. officinalis in Ria de Aveiro. \n\nOne of the most important metals presented in the aquatic systems is mercury (Hg), \n\nsince it is widely considered to be among the top priorities in environmental pollutants \n\nin the scope of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and at a global scale \n\n(Pereira et al., 2009b). Ria de Aveiro is not an exception regarding the importance of \n\nthis metal within the lagoon, in fact the studied area has historical discharges of \n\neffluents from the chlor-alkali industry of the industrial complex of Estarreja into \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n| P a g e 184 \n\nLaranjo bay (Lucas et al., 1986; Hall et al., 1985; Pereira et al., 1998; Monterroso et al., \n\n2003b). Nowadays, the Laranjo bay is a non-significant active source of Hg since the \n\ndischarges stopped in 1985, however it is still an internal source of Hg due to the \n\nsediments that have been highly contaminated with Hg (Hall et al., 1985; Coelho et al., \n\n2008). Hg distribution in Ria de Aveiro showed that levels of Hg in the lagoon are low \n\nwith the exception of Laranjo bay that presented higher values. However, only one \n\nindividual of all the examined cuttlefishes presented an Hg level above the limit \n\npermitted, so we can conclude that the cuttlefish caught in the lagoon are not a concern \n\nfor human health. Once more, abiotic parameters interfered with life of cuttlefish, \n\nbecause temperature can contribute to a higher methylation rate (Bustamante et al., \n\n2006a), which could lead to a higher uptake of mercury by aquatic organisms. The \n\nhistorical contamination of Laranjo bay and the higher values of temperature observed \n\nin this sampling site can explain the higher values of Hg in this specific area of the Ria \n\nde Aveiro. The Hg contained in the sediments may become available to biota (Coelho et \n\nal., 2007), eventually to food chain thru the benthic organisms (Bryan and Langston, \n\n1992; Lee et al., 1998; Warren et al. 1998), or be remobilized when sediments are \n\ndredged and disposed into water bodies (Newell et al., 1998; Chapman et al., 2003). \n\nSimilarly the high Cd concentrations in Ria de Aveiro is also the result of the industrial \n\ncomplex of Estarreja, near the Laranjo bay, and the contamination of others locals of the \n\nlagoon are made by transport of contaminated sediments and water along the lagoon by \n\nthe tide currents of Ria the Aveiro (Pereira et al., 1998b, Monterroso et al., 2003a) and \n\nby plankton exportation (Monterroso et al., 2003b). Bustamante et al. (2000) suggested \n\nthat high Cd levels in digestive gland of species captured in contaminated areas are also \n\nrelated to the environment. \n\nMetal concentrations increase as the distance to the sea increase. This pattern of metals \n\ndistribution in digestive gland appears to reflect the location of anthropogenic sources \n\nof metals discharged in the northern region of Ria de Aveiro (Monterroso et al., 2003a). \n\nLaranjo (LAR) and Torreira (TOR) are, probably, the most contaminated areas, \n\npresenting the highest values of essential (Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) \n\nmetals in the digestive gland. The high values in Torreira (TOR) suggest that this site \n\nsuffers the influence of Largo da Coroa, considered the second most contaminated area \n\nafter Laranjo bay in Ria de Aveiro (Monterroso et al., 2003a).  \n\nFor metal-metal relationship in digestive gland and mantle, only Pb presented a low \n\ncorrelation between the two tissues. Only the ratio Cd:Cu in digestive gland presented a \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n   Page | 185  \n\npositive correlation with wet body weight, meaning that Cd was progressively \n\nsequestrated in digestive gland with age. This pattern was also observed for S. \n\nofficinalis in Pereira et al. (2009b) and for O. vulgaris in Raimundo et al. (2005). \n\nThe non-essential metal Cd, when in high concentrations in digestive gland, can \n\ncompete with Zn and Cu (essential metals) for the same ligands, specific \n\nmetalloproteins presented in digestive gland of cephalopods, since they have similarities \n\nin chemical behaviour (Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante, 1998a). For this \n\nreason, significant correlations between Cd-Cu and Cd-Zn were expected, as found in \n\nPereira et al. (2009b), although only Cd and Cu in digestive gland showed the expected \n\nbehaviour. Since essential elements like Cu tend to be maintained at a fairly constant \n\nconcentrations in tissues, Cd:Cu ratios increase in cephalopods contaminated by Cd \n\n(Bustamante et al., 1998a; Raimundo et al., 2005; Pereira et al., 2009b). Measured \n\nlevels of Cd in cuttlefish tissues, despite being below legal limits, may lead to some \n\nconcern for human consumption. \n\nThe cuttlefish S. officinalis feeds on a large variety of living prey, including small \n\nmolluscs, crabs, shrimps, other cuttlefish, and juvenile demersal fishes. Crustaceans and \n\nfishes, which are preferential preys of cuttlefish (Pinczon du Sel et al., 1997; Pinczon du \n\nSel et al., 2000), also accumulate more Hg than other species (Schuhmacher et al., \n\n1994).  \n\nMercury is considered to be one of the most problematic metals in marine ecosystems \n\ndue to bioaccumulation and biomagnification in marine food webs (EPA, 2001). \n\nVarious studies reported Hg concentrations in different tissues (Alcobia, 1995; Buzina \n\net al., 1989; Stoeppler et al., 1979; Rossi et al., 1993; Seixas et al., 2005a; Raimundo et \n\nal., 2004, 2010; Bustamante et al., 2008). Mercury concentrations in the Aveiro lagoon \n\nare greatly influenced by the historical discharges of mercury from industrial activities \n\ninto Laranjo Bay (Pereira et al., 1998a; Pereira et al., 2009a), leading to Hg \n\nconcentrations higher than other ecosystems also polluted, like Kastela Bay in Adriatic \n\nthat is known for receiving discharges of Hg from mine exploitation (Faganeli et al., \n\n2003).  \n\nLike other metals, Hg concentrations in cephalopod may vary with biological factors \n\nsuch as age (size), sex and maturity stage (Bustamante et al., 1998a; Raimundo et al., \n\n2004; Seixas et al., 2005a; Ayas and Ozogul, 2011). It is generally admitted that Hg \n\nconcentrations in cephalopod tissues are positively correlated with size (Monteiro et al., \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n| P a g e 186 \n\n1992; Rossi et al., 1993; Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 1999 in Bustamante et al., 2006a), \n\nhowever, due to restrict range of size of captured individuals this couldn\u2019t be verified.  \n\nWhile the mantle is a body compartment that can store Hg in significant amounts, the \n\ndigestive gland plays a major role in storage and detoxification of several metals. The \n\ndifferent patterns of accumulation of trace metals and Hg suggest that cephalopods have \n\ndifferent mechanisms/rates of uptake and/or sequestration of these metals (Pierce et al., \n\n2008). This contrast between trace metals and Hg partitioning was also observed in \n\nother cephalopods (Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas et al., 2005a; Bustamante et al., \n\n2006a).  \n\nMetal bioaccumulation in cephalopods is usually related to a single organ, mainly the \n\ndigestive gland, known to play a major role in the energetic metabolism of cephalopods \n\n(Boucaud-Camou and Boucher-Rodoni, 1983 in Bustamante et al., 2006a). The \n\ndigestive gland is known to accumulate metal in large amounts (Martin and Flegal, \n\n1975; Finger and Smith, 1987; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 2000). \n\nThis organ is deeply involved in the metabolism of Zn, Cu and Cd (Martin and Flegal, \n\n1975; Smith et al., 1984; Finger and Smith, 1987; Miramand and Guary, 1980; \n\nBustamante et al., 1998b, 2002a). The mean concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in \n\nthe digestive gland are much higher than the mean concentrations of those metals in \n\nmantle while Hg presents similar levels in both tissues. Metal concentrations in different \n\nmaturity stages of cuttlefish show that the accumulation is different for each stage of \n\ntheir life cycle (Bustamante et al., 2002b; Bustamante et al., 2004; Bustamante et al., \n\n2006b; Villanueva and Bustamante, 2006). The results obtained in this studied \n\ndetermine that some metals remain constant along the age (Fe and Cu); others increase \n\nalong maturity stage (Cd, Zn and Hg) and some decrease with age (Pb). Seasonal \n\nmigrations evidenced in the life cycle of S. officinalis may interfere with \n\nbioaccumulation processes of metals, since cuttlefish migrates from coastal areas (more \n\npolluted) to offshore (less polluted than coast) (Miramand et al., 2006). \n\nIn digestive gland, Zn presented a significant increase from stage I (243\u00b1112 \u00b5g g-\n\n1.DWt) to stage II (578\u00b1270 \u00b5g g-1.DWt), stage I presented a value 2.4 times higher \n\nthan stage II. This increase between immature and juveniles could be due to differences \n\nin efficiency of their digestive metabolism (Mangold, 1989 in Bustamante et al., \n\n2002b).  \n\nThe levels of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in the digestive gland are higher than those found \n\nin mantle, what is in close agreement with other cephalopod species (Raimundo et al., \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n   Page | 187  \n\n2004; Raimundo et al., 2005; Pereira, 2003; Pereira et al., 2009b). These metals, in S. \n\nofficinalis are preferentially accumulated in the digestive gland. Various studies \n\nconfirmed that the digestive gland of cephalopods concentrates high levels of Zn and \n\nCu, and have an exceptional ability to store Cd (Miramand and Guary, 1980; \n\nBustamante et al., 1998b, 2002a).  \n\nIn general, metal concentrations measured in this study for mantle and digestive gland \n\nof S. officinalis were higher, when compared with values reported for same species and \n\nother cephalopods of various studies, but comparable to previous studies along the \n\nPortuguese coast (Pereira et al., 2009b; Seixas et al., 2005b; Raimundo et al., 2005, \n\n2008). Nevertheless, comparisons between specimens from different ecosystems must \n\nbe done carefully as identical species may exhibit different feeding habits, growth rates \n\nand habitats, which may interfere with metal accumulation (Bustamante et al., 1998b; \n\nRaimundo et al., 2004; Pierce et al., 2008). \n\nExtremely high values of Cd were found in the mantle of specimens captured in Laranjo \n\n(LAR) but a relatively low value of this element was found in the digestive gland. The \n\nincrease of Cd in mantle, without a corresponding increase in the digestive gland, where \n\nthis element is stored (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002a; Bustamante et al., \n\n2002b) suggests that the levels in mantle result from a higher transference of Cd in \n\nwater, most likely as a result of uptake through the diet (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante \n\net al., 2002b). For Cd the values obtained in all sites of Ria de Aveiro are higher than \n\nthe values measured in previous studies.  \n\nThe similarity of Hg levels in mantle and digestive gland could be explained by the \n\naffinity of mantle to store MeHg, i.e. predominant form of Hg stored in muscle tissue \n\n(Harris et al., 2003; Amlund et al., 2007). However, compared to other metals like Cd, \n\nthe role of digestive gland in storage of Hg appears to be relatively limited. This may be \n\ndue to a preferential redistribution of Hg to muscular tissues as methylmercury (MeHg) \n\n(Bustamante et al., 2006a).  \n\nThe most striking result was the extremely high value of Pb in the digestive gland of \n\nimmature specimens. This aspect can be related with the source of intake of this metal. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no data on the respective proportions of elements \n\nincorporated from food and seawater has been published for cephalopods. So we \n\nconsider that there were two possibilities for this value, the food ingested by immature \n\nspecimens is probably highly contaminated with Pb or the specimens were subjected to \n\nan acute exposure and recent uptake of Pb by seawater. On these immature specimens, \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n| P a g e 188 \n\nbeing on an early stage of maturation, the digestive gland may not be working properly, \n\nleading only to the accumulation of metal and not to its detoxification. It was shown \n\n(Miramand et al. 2006) that embryos present very low metal concentrations compared \n\nto older cuttlefish, and that concentrations of embryos were close or even identical to \n\nthose measured in the vitellus of newly spawned eggs, which suggests that the vitellus \n\ncontains a sufficient amount of essential metals (Cu, Fe, and Zn) needed for the \n\ndevelopment of the embryos.  \n\nDuring the life cycle of cuttlefish, specifically between stage I and stage IV, Cd \n\nconcentrations increased 14 times, in the digestive gland, compared to a factor of 2 for \n\nmantle. Cd is strongly retained in the tissue of adult cuttlefishes and this high retention \n\ncapacity concerned almost exclusively the digestive gland. Several authors reported that \n\nthe digestive gland play a primary role in the accumulation of Cd in cuttlefish \n\n(Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002a). Thus, \n\nassimilated Cd in the digestive gland may be considered as actually stored. The lower \n\nretention efficiency for Cd measured in immature cuttlefish would result from the \n\nincomplete development of the digestive gland in early juveniles (Bustamante et al., \n\n2002b) and a restrict transfer of this non-essential metal from food in earlier stages. \n\nCephalopods such as Sepia officinalis accumulate Cd mainly from diet (Bustamante et \n\nal., 2002b). \n\nThe results revealed that the digestive gland of S. officinalis has an extraordinary \n\ncapacity to store harmful elements like Cd and Pb, but also essential elements like Fe, \n\nZn and Cu. Several studies also confirmed that the digestive gland of cephalopods \n\nconcentrates high levels of Zn and Cu, and have an exceptional ability to store Cd \n\n(Miramand and Guary, 1980; Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2002b). However, the digestive \n\ngland presented other functions like redistribution of metals to others tissues, and for \n\nthese reasons the digestive gland is consider a good biomarker of contamination for \n\nmetals in cuttlefish. Due to the species mobility together with the influence of local food \n\ncomposition at different sites of the lagoon, metal concentrations in tissues cannot be \n\nexclusively viewed as direct reflex of environmental conditions. However, the obtained \n\nresults and all that has been published suggest that the major source of contamination in \n\nRia de Aveiro is the large complex of chemical industries located near the lagoon. The \n\ncontinuous effluent discharge had a considerable impact on bottom sediments (OSPAR, \n\n2000). Sediments act as source and sink for pollution, because once the pollutants are \n\nintroduced, they may remain accumulated in soil for several years, even after removal \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n   Page | 189  \n\nof the sources (Paterson et al., 1996; Hursthouse, 2001; Wong et al., 2006). For \n\nexample, Ria de Aveiro still have a gradient contamination in the sediments (Pereira et \n\nal., 1998 and Coelho et al., 2005) because of the continuous direct discharges, since the \n\n1950s of the chlor-alkali industry. Soil contamination resulting from anthropogenic \n\nactivities may derive from both diffuse and local sources and is generally reflected by \n\nenhanced concentrations of acidifying contaminants (e.g. SO2, NOx), metals (e.g. \n\ncadmium, lead, mercury), metalloids such as arsenic, and organic compounds (such as \n\npesticides, herbicides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated \n\nbiphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins (PCDDs) (EC, 2002). According to Scullion (2006) the \n\nmain anthropogenic sources of soil contaminants are mining and smelting; fossil fuel \n\ncombustion; sewage sludge; process and manufacturing industries (specifically \n\nmetallurgical, electronics and chemical); waste disposal; the land spreading of \n\nfertilizers, fungicides and other agricultural materials; atmospheric deposition from \n\ntraffic; waste incineration; the spillage of liquids such as solvents or oil; and practices of \n\nirrigation with contaminated waters. For Aveiro Lagoon previous studies (Pastorinho et \n\nal., 2012) considered that the major sources of sediments contamination are the 3 main \n\nwatercourses (Caster, Antu\u00e3, and Vouga). However, Ria de Aveiro is influenced by \n\nstrong marine tides (70 x 106 m\n3\n, in Picado et al. 2010), which redistributes sediment \n\nbound metals. According to Pastorinho et al. (2012), bottom sediments in the Ria de \n\nAveiro system are in their majority unpolluted, with few metal hotspots and only these \n\nsites constitute a risk for biota. These results are in accordance with the ones obtained in \n\nthis work, which demonstrated that the only problematic site were Laranjo bay, \n\npresenting much higher values of metals. Indeed, these results suggest a gradient of \n\ncontamination in the direction of Laranjo. \n\nAs final conclusion, as shown throughout the present study, there are general \n\nsimilarities but also differences between the Ria de Aveiro and other geographical areas \n\nreferred in the study. This emphasizes its uniqueness not only in terms of abiotic \n\nparameters but especially in the biotic aspects, which enhances the idea that this \n\ntransitional ecosystem should be deeply studied for this specie. Indeed the Ria the \n\nAveiro is the only typically estuarine coastal lagoon, all the others sites represented the \n\noffshore or presented a higher communication with the offshore. \n\nThis study has provided the first attempt to explain the seasonal and spatial variations in \n\nthe reproductive life cycle of the cuttlefish in a wide range of sites in the Ria de Aveiro, \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n| P a g e 190 \n\nhaving in consideration historical discharges in the lagoon, and the results revealed \n\ndifferent patterns in the accumulation of different metals along the life cycle.  \n\nFuture research should be addressed in order to enable a progressive understanding of \n\nthe role of cuttlefish in Ria de Aveiro. New studies focused on the trophic ecology for \n\ncuttlefish should be made to better understand the predatory impact of this specie in fish \n\ncommunity of the lagoon. \n\n \n\nVI.1.
