Este trabalho utilizou dados do modelo WAVEWATCH III (WW3) entre 2001 a 2009 como ferramenta para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de aspectos importantes em uma determinada regi\u00e3o do Atl\u00e2ntico Sul que \u00e9 vulner\u00e1vel ao impacto de eventos extremos, ocasionados por ciclones extratropicais. Pelo fato de serem os principais controladores de padr\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticos, causarem extremas mudan\u00e7as no tempo e das maiores alturas de ondas serem geradas em sua regi\u00e3o de influ\u00eancia, estes fen\u00f4menos meteorol\u00f3gicos s\u00e3o de grande import\u00e2ncia para o estudo de ondas oce\u00e2nicas e suas a\u00e7\u00f5es em regi\u00f5es costeiras assim como tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 importante conhecer sua origem, forma\u00e7\u00e3o e trajet\u00f3ria. Com os dados das componentes U e V do vento provenientes do modelo foram calculadas as trajet\u00f3rias dos ciclones extratropicais baseados na vorticidade relativa de seu centro. Ao todo, 28 eventos foram analisados dentro deste per\u00edodo. Estas foram classificadas com base em suas trajet\u00f3rias em tr\u00eas padr\u00f5es, o Padr\u00e3o III \u00e9 o mais comum (41,4%), com uma maior incid\u00eancia de eventos que aparecem em maio. Os maiores valores de altura m\u00e1xima e m\u00e9dia foram gerados no outono e inverno, com uma maior incid\u00eancia tamb\u00e9m em maio. O evento de maio de 2001 apresentou a ocorr\u00eancia simult\u00e2nea de dois ciclones causando danos \u00e0 linha de costa em v\u00e1rias cidades. Os valores de altura de onda e intensidade do vento deste evento se mostraram superiores aos demais. Dados do sat\u00e9lite ENVISAT, obtidos por um sensor ASAR, foram comparados com os dados do modelo WW3 para o ano de 2007. Para comparar os dados de sat\u00e9lite com os dados de modelo foram utilizados dois algor\u00edtimos para uma representa\u00e7\u00e3o espa\u00e7o-temporal mais realista poss\u00edvel. Utilizando par\u00e2metros estat\u00edsticos como vi\u00e9s, e \u00edndice de espalhamento a altura de swell foi analisada. Os dados de sat\u00e9lite mostraram uma grande uniformidade espacial comparados com os dados do modelo. Subestima\u00e7\u00e3o da altura de swell pelo modelo nos tr\u00f3picos e em regi\u00f5es espec\u00edficas s\u00e3o encontradas em altas latitudes. Com o intuito de verificar e comparar os par\u00e2metros de comportamento de ondas pr\u00f3ximas de regi\u00f5es costeiras, foi realizado um estudo de 6 eventos, 3 localizados na regi\u00e3o sul, e mais 3 no nordeste do Brasil entre 2002 e 2009, priorizando eventos onde o swell era dominante. Estes eventos foram selecionados com base no intervalo no qual o sat\u00e9lite (ENVISAT) mede o comprimento de onda para uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o mais realista. Dados do modelo WW3 e do sat\u00e9lite foram utilizados como condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fronteira para o modelo SWAN. Para cada evento as duas simula\u00e7\u00f5es foram comparadas com base no tempo e espa\u00e7o e tamb\u00e9m para pontos espec\u00edficos localizados em \u00e1guas rasas e profundas. Observou-se que houve uma excelente correla\u00e7\u00e3o, evidenciada pelo coeficiente de Pearson, entre as duas simula\u00e7\u00f5es nas duas regi\u00f5es estudadas, principalmente na an\u00e1lise espacial e temporal. Em \u00e1guas rasas e profundas maior correla\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 observada no sul. Constatou-se tamb\u00e9m que o per\u00edodo de pico Tp para a simula\u00e7\u00e3o com dados do WW3, \u00e9 subestimado em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 simula\u00e7\u00e3o com dados do sat\u00e9lite em todos os eventos. Os resultados mostram que houve uma grande coer\u00eancia entre as duas simula\u00e7\u00f5es com valores de coeficiente de Pearson acima de 0.8. Embora o Tp aponte maior disparidade entre as duas simula\u00e7\u00f5es, a tend\u00eancia da s\u00e9rie hist\u00f3rica provou ser consistente em ambos os dados simulados; com o WW3 e com o sat\u00e9lite.\nAbstract\nOcean waves are caused disturbances on the surface of the oceans and they are one of the most important energy sources for modeling the geometry of the coasts around the world and constituting a hazard to coastal works and offshore operations. This study used the WAVEWATCH III (WW3) model data from 2001 to 2009 as a tool to obtain important aspects in a particular South Atlantic region that is vulnerable to the impact of extreme events caused by tropical cyclones. Because they are the main weather patterns drivers, causing extreme changes in weather and greater heights of waves being generated in its area of influence, these meteorological phenomena are of great importance for the study of ocean waves and their actions in coastal regions and it is also important to know your origin, development and trajetory. With wind components U and V from the model trajectories of extratropical cyclones were calculated based on relative vorticity from its center. Altogether, 28 events were analyzed within this period. These were classified based on their trajectories in three patterns, the pattern III is the most common (41.4%), with a higher incidence of events that appear in May. The highest maximum and average height values were generated in the fall and winter, with a higher incidence also in May. The event of May 2001 featured the simultaneous occurrence of two cyclones causing damage to the coastline in several cities. The wave height and wind speed values of the event were higher than the others. ENVISAT satellite data obtained by a ASAR sensor, were compared with the WW3 model data for the year 2007. To compare the satellite data with the model data two algorithms were used to provide a space-time representation as realistic as posssible. Using statistical parameters such as bias and scattering index the swell height was analyzed. Satellite data showed a great spatial uniformity compared with model data. Underestimation of swell height by the model in the tropics and at specific regions high latitudes are found. In order to verify and compare the wave behavior near coastal regions, a study of six events was conducted, three located in the southern region, and three more in northeastern Brazil between 2002 and 2009, prioritizing events where swell was dominant. For a more realistic comparison these events were selected based on the range in which the satellite (ENVISAT) measures the wavelength. WW3 model data and the satellite were used as boundary conditions for the SWAN model. The two simulations were compared based on time and space and also to specific points located in shallow and deep water, for each event. It was observed that there was an excellent correlation shown by the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two simulations studied in both regions, particularly in the temporal and spatial analysis. In shallow and deep water highest correlation is observed in the south. It was also found that the peak period Tp for simulation WW3 data is underestimated in relation to simulation with satellite data on all events. The results show that there was a great coherence between the two simulations with Pearson coefficient values above 0.8. Although Tp points out greater disparity between the two simulations, the trend of the series proved to be consistent in both simulated data.\nSum\u00e1rio\nLista de Figuras\tviii\nLista de Tabelas\tx\n1\tIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o\t1\n1.1\tObjetivos............................................................... 3\n1.2\tEstrutura da Tese....................................................... 4\n2\tMateriais e\tm\u00e9todos\t5\n2.1\tDados\tde Sat\u00e9lite ..................................................... 5\n2.2\tModelo de gera\u00e7\u00e3o e propaga\u00e7\u00e3o de ondas................................. 6\n2.2.1\tWAVEWATCH III..................................................... 6\n2.2.2\tSWAN.............................................................. 7\nRefer\u00eancias Bibliogr\u00e1ficas\t8\n3\tTracking extratropical cyclones which cause extreme ocean wave events in the\nSouthwestern Atlantic Ocean\t10\n3.1\tIntroduction .......................................................... 11\n3.2\tData and methods ...................................................... 13\n3.3\tResults and Discussion ................................................ 14\n3.3.1\tGeneral View .................................................... 15\n3.3.2\tEvent of May 2001 (Event 3)...................................... 20\n3.3.3\tModel description................................................ 20\nSynoptic features ..................................................... 25\n3.4\tConclusions ........................................................... 25\nAcknowledgements ................................................................... 27\nReferences\t28\n4\tUniform spatial representation of global ocean wave fields obtained from Satellite\nand comparison with model data\t30\n4.1\tIntroduction................................................................... 31\n4.2\tSatellite and model wave data.................................................. 33\n4.2.1\tSatellite data.......................................................... 33\n4.2.2\tThe wave model ......................................................... 34\n4.3\tUniform spatial representation................................................. 34\n4.4\tSwell Height................................................................... 36\n4.5\tConclusions ................................................................... 41\nAcknowledgements ................................................................... 41\nReferences\t42\n5\tSensibility of a model of regional waves the boundary conditions provided by glo-\nbal model and satellite\t43\n5.1\tIntroduction................................................................... 44\n5.2\tStudy area..................................................................... 46\n5.2.1\tSouth region of Brazil.................................................. 46\n5.2.2\tNortheast region of\tBrazil.............................................. 46\n5.3\tMaterials and methods.......................................................... 47\n5.3.1\tModel description....................................................... 47\n5.3.2\tSatellite data ......................................................... 47\n5.3.3\tBoundary conditions\tand Statistics indices.............................. 48\n5.4\tResults and discussion......................................................... 49\n5.4.1\tSouth region ........................................................... 50\n5.4.2\tNortheast region ....................................................... 52\n5.5\tConclusion............................................................ 55\nAcknowledgements ......................................................... 56\nReferences\t60\n6\tConclus\u00e3o\t62\n7\tAnexos\t64\nLista de Figuras\n3.1\tCyclones tracks Pattern I (A) and synoptic situation (B)....................... 15\n3.2\tCyclones tracks Pattern II (A) and synoptic situation (B)...................... 15\n3.3\tCyclones tracks Pattern III (A) and synoptic situation (B)..................... 17\n3.4\tWind direction and speed for the three patterns, on the studied locations...... 18\n3.5\tSignificant wave height and average height for the three locations............. 19\n3.6\tMaximum and average wind velocity for the three locations...................... 19\n3.7\tStudy area showing the grid used for the simulation of the event 3............. 21\n3.8\tSimultaneous tracks of cyclones associated with the event 3.

Ondas oce\u00e2nicas s\u00e3o perturba\u00e7\u00f5es ocasionadas na superf\u00edcie dos oceanos. As principais ondas de superf\u00edcie s\u00e3o as ondas de gravidade cuja for\u00e7a restauradora \u00e9 a gravidade, as quais s\u00e3o geradas pelo vento. As caracter\u00edsticas destas ondas dependem da velocidade e dura\u00e7\u00e3o (tempo) da a\u00e7\u00e3o do vento e pela extens\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie aquosa sobre a qual o vento est\u00e1 soprando. Est\u00e3o intimamente associadas \u00e0s varia\u00e7\u00f5es dos regimes atmosf\u00e9ricos, possuindo grande variabilidade espacial e temporal (CUCHIARA et al., 2006). S\u00e3o as principais e mais constantes fonte de energia no oceano, exercendo um papel fundamental na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fei\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras (TOZZI; CALLIARI, 2000). No oceano aberto podem propagar-se por enormes dist\u00e2ncias com a perda m\u00ednima de energia. Quando chegam pr\u00f3ximas a costa, sofrem diversos processos f\u00edsicos que envolvem estruturas de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o, adi\u00e7\u00e3o e remo\u00e7\u00e3o de energia da onda. Os processos que removem a energia s\u00e3o a dissipa\u00e7\u00e3o por fric\u00e7\u00e3o com o fundo, percola\u00e7\u00e3o e atenua\u00e7\u00e3o por viscosidade. As ondas pr\u00f3ximas do seu centro de gera\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o denominadas de vagas (sea) quando j\u00e1 se encontram afastadas do seu centro de gera\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o denominadas ondula\u00e7\u00f5es (swell). Atingem a costa do Rio Grande do Sul atrav\u00e9s do quadrante sudeste (SE) (MOTTA, 1967; STRAUCH, 1996; COLI, 2000). Elas possuem um per\u00edodo longo e altura e dist\u00e2ncia entre as cristas regulares. As vagas s\u00e3o ondas mais irregulares com per\u00edodo menor que as ondula\u00e7\u00f5es.\nO conhecimento do clima de ondas no tempo e no espa\u00e7o \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio para resolver a din\u00e2mica dos processos morfodin\u00e2micos e tamb\u00e9m para a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de obras costeiras, recupera\u00e7\u00e3o e reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o praial e opera\u00e7\u00f5es em mar aberto. Dados de campo s\u00e3o escassos na costa brasileira. Alguns estudos do clima de ondas foram realizados para determinadas \u00e1reas do sul do Brasil. Estes estudos foram baseados em diversas fontes de dados que abrangem observa\u00e7\u00f5es visuais (MOTTA, 1963; MELO; ALVES, 1993), medi\u00e7\u00f5es de campo (MOTTA, 1963; STRAUCH, 1998) e por sensoriamento remoto (COLI, 1994, 2000). Dados coletados em campo podem apresentar muitas falhas devido \u00e0 falta de energia, perda do equipamento, manuten\u00e7\u00e3o, entre outras. Assim uma alternativa \u00e9 o uso de dados oceanogr\u00e1ficos obtidos por sat\u00e9lites para extrair dados como altura, per\u00edodo e dire\u00e7\u00e3o da onda.\nAs medi\u00e7\u00f5es de sat\u00e9lites tem apresentado import\u00e2ncia cada vez maior em oceanografia, sobretudo pela extens\u00e3o das \u00e1reas cobertas, n\u00famero de observa\u00e7\u00f5es, sua repetibilidade e o n\u00famero de vari\u00e1veis medidas, embora a acur\u00e1cia das medi\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o seja muito grande e elas n\u00e3o possam ser estendidas a profundidades maiores, restringindo-se \u00e0 superf\u00edcie dos oceanos. De qualquer maneira, com o desenvolvimento da tecnologia de sensoriamento remoto, essas restri\u00e7\u00f5es tendem a ser superadas, sobretudo no que diz respeito a precis\u00e3o das medi\u00e7\u00f5es. Os sensores aplicados em sat\u00e9lites de observa\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica utilizam a radia\u00e7\u00e3o eletromagn\u00e9tica para coletar as informa\u00e7\u00f5es da superf\u00edcie da \u00e1gua. Estes sensores podem ser passivos ou ativos. Os sensores passivos apenas recebem as ondas que emanam naturalmente da superf\u00edcie. Por outro lado os sensores ativos s\u00e3o aqueles que emitem ondas e medem um ou mais par\u00e2metros da onda que s\u00e3o refletidos. Os sensores ativos operam na faixa de micro-ondas e s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m chamados de radares. Por operarem na faixa de micro-ondas e emitirem ondas, os radares tem a capacidade de realizarem medi\u00e7\u00f5es continuamente, sob qualquer condi\u00e7\u00e3o meteorol\u00f3gica. Dentro dos sensores ativos, destacam-se o escater\u00f4metro, o radar altim\u00e9trico e o radar de abertura sint\u00e9tica (SAR), que medem aspectos din\u00e2micos como eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie, velocidade e dire\u00e7\u00e3o do vento, cobertura de gelo (e seus movimentos), altura de onda e o espectro. O radar de abertura sint\u00e9tica avan\u00e7ada (ASAR) \u00e9 uma vers\u00e3o aprimorada do instrumento SAR e \u00e9 o \u00fanico sensor, at\u00e9 o momento, capaz de obter medi\u00e7\u00f5es do espectro direcional de ondas com cobertura cont\u00ednua e global, e consequentemente, permitir a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o completa de um estado de mar. As caracter\u00edsticas orbitais dos sat\u00e9lites se limitam \u00e0s observa\u00e7\u00f5es feitas durante as passadas que realiza com intervalos hor\u00e1rios a di\u00e1rios. Sendo assim, as desvantagens do uso destes dados est\u00e1 ligado ao intervalo de tempo entre as medi\u00e7\u00f5es e na restri\u00e7\u00e3o destas medidas a regi\u00f5es localizadas colinearmente \u00e0 trajet\u00f3ria do sat\u00e9lite (COLI, 1994).\nDevido \u00e0 escassez de dados coletados in situ, al\u00e9m dos dados de sat\u00e9lite, podemos utilizar a modelagem num\u00e9rica como ferramenta para obter par\u00e2metros de ondas para seu estudo e tamb\u00e9m para o fornecimento de previs\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas. A previs\u00e3o do estado do mar \u00e9 essencial para o projeto de constru\u00e7\u00f5es de prote\u00e7\u00e3o costeira, portos e canais de navega\u00e7\u00e3o (SCH-NEGGENBURGER; G\u00dcNTHER; ROSENTHAL, 2000) tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o importantes para atividades offshore como explora\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo e navega\u00e7\u00e3o. Os modelos de onda, no entanto, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o aplicados apenas em previs\u00f5es (forecasting), mas tamb\u00e9m usados com dados pret\u00e9ritos (hindcasting)para prever a propaga\u00e7\u00e3o de ondas em eventos passados, que podem auxiliar nos estudos relacionados \u00e0 eros\u00e3o costeira e transporte de sedimentos, estimativa da energia, projetos de portos e estruturas costeiras e oce\u00e2nicas como plataformas de explora\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo e tamb\u00e9m na reconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o de eventos extremos, como furac\u00f5es ou tempestades.\nA implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo de ondas utilizando condi\u00e7\u00f5es de contorno que melhor representem os fen\u00f4menos atmosf\u00e9ricos caracterizam-se como uma ferramenta de simula\u00e7\u00e3o\nbastante importante para o estudo da f\u00edsica das ondas (CUCHIARA et al., 2006). Nos modelos de primeira gera\u00e7\u00e3o a intera\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o-linear \u00e9 desprezada ou, se parametrizada, pouco significativa, sendo representada de uma forma simples (World Meteorological Organization, 1998). Nos modelos de segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o, a intera\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o-linear \u00e9 representada atrav\u00e9s de parametriza\u00e7\u00f5es ou tratada atrav\u00e9s de forma simplificada, o que impede o crescimento independente dos diversos componentes do espectro. Os modelos de segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o tem dificuldade na representa\u00e7\u00e3o de mares complexos gerados por r\u00e1pidas mudan\u00e7as nos campos de vento (GROUP, 1988). A primeira tentativa de produzir um modelo de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o foi baseado em um m\u00e9todo computacional introduzido por Hasselmann e Hasselmann (1981). Um grupo internacional de v\u00e1rios pesquisadores se uniu para desenvolver conjuntamente um modelo de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o, que poderia ser implementado operacionalmente em escalas global e regional. O grupo WAM (GROUP, 1988) desenvolveu o modelo WAM que apresentou grande sucesso, devido ao algoritmo DIA criado por Hasselmann e Hasselmann (1985) que forneceu uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o aproximada das intera\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o-lineares com muito baixo custo computacional. Desde o advento do algoritmo DIA, outros modelos de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam sido desenvolvidos de forma independente do grupo WAM. Uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo WAM foi desenvolvida por Tolman (1991) denominado WAVEWATCH. As descri\u00e7\u00f5es dos processo f\u00edsicos no WAM e no WAVEWATCH s\u00e3o similares. Booij, Holthuijsen e Ris (1997) desenvolveu um modelo de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em \u00e1guas rasas e bacias fechadas. Tolman e Chalikov (1996) apresentaram um modelo de ondas com novas formula\u00e7\u00f5es para a entrada de vento e os termos de fonte de dissipa\u00e7\u00e3o, bem como inova\u00e7\u00f5es no regime de propaga\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica usado no WAM.\nEste estudo visa utilizar os dados de modelos num\u00e9ricos para acompanhar eventos extremos no Atl\u00e2ntico Sul, bem como comparar estes dados com os do sat\u00e9lite ENVISAT e no comportamento do clima de ondas atrav\u00e9s de an\u00e1lises estat\u00edsticas.\n1.1\tObjetivos\nO objetivo geral deste trabalho \u00e9 a compara\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e temporal dos dados obtidos do espectro direcional de ondas obtidos pelo sat\u00e9lite ENVISAT, pelo sensor ASAR, com os dados obtidos pelo modelo WAVEWATCH III.\nAl\u00e9m desse objetivo geral, ser\u00e3o abordados os seguintes objetivos espec\u00edficos:\n\u2022\tCalcular as trajet\u00f3ria de ciclones extratropicais no Atl\u00e2ntico Sul entre 2001-2009 utilizando dados do modelo WW3.\n\u2022\tObter dados de altura de swell atrav\u00e9s do espectro direcional de ondas adquirido do ENVISAT, em uma malha regular.\n\u2022\tObter um algoritmo espa\u00e7o-temporal que organize os dados de maneira uniforme.\n\u2022\tComparar os resultados de simula\u00e7\u00f5es nas regi\u00f5es sul e nordeste do Brasil utilizando dados de sat\u00e9lite e modelo como entrada.\n1.2\tEstrutura da Tese\nEsta tese de doutorado est\u00e1 composta em torno de artigos cient\u00edficos de acordo com a Norma 103 do Programa de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Geoci\u00eancias da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. Os artigos foram submetidos \u00e0 publica\u00e7\u00e3o em peri\u00f3dicos. Sendo assim, o corpo principal da tese (que equivale as sess\u00f5es de resultados e discuss\u00f5es) \u00e9 apresentado em tr\u00eas artigos.\n\u2022\tO cap\u00edtulo 1 apresenta uma introdu\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o tema da tese e tamb\u00e9m seus objetivos.\n\u2022\tO cap\u00edtulo 2 cont\u00e9m a descri\u00e7\u00e3o dos m\u00e9todos utilizados para aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados utilizados nesta tese.\n\u2022\tOs cap\u00edtulos 3, 4 e 5 corresponde ao corpo principal da tese onde est\u00e3o localizados os tr\u00eas artigos cient\u00edficos.\n\u2022\tO cap\u00edtulo 6 abrange as considera\u00e7\u00f5es finais e principais conclus\u00f5es.\n2\tMateriais e m\u00e9todos\n2.1\tDados de Sat\u00e9lite\nOs dados de altura significativa e velocidade do vento para o artigo 1 foram obtidos atrav\u00e9s do Globwave (http://globwave.ifremer.fr/). Este projeto \u00e9 uma iniciativa de tr\u00eas anos financiado pela Ag\u00eancia Espacial Europeia (ESA), para atender \u00e0s necessidades dos usu\u00e1rios de produtos de onda obtidas por sat\u00e9lite em todo o mundo. Os dados usados foram adquiridos por alt\u00edmetro que \u00e9 um instrumento ativo que emite pulsos na banda de radar. O princ\u00edpio consiste em medir com precis\u00e3o a altitude de um sat\u00e9lite, atrav\u00e9s de pulsos, e em seguida, a dist\u00e2ncia entre o sat\u00e9lite e a superf\u00edcie do alvo. Ao calcular a diferen\u00e7a entre os dois, a \"altura da superf\u00edcie do mar\"\u00e9 obtida. Esta altura da superf\u00edcie do mar e, em particular quaisquer varia\u00e7\u00f5es, pode ser usado para deduzir uma vasta quantidade de informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o oceano e seus movimentos. Com os sistemas tais como Doris e GPS, que medem a posi\u00e7\u00e3o do sat\u00e9lite de forma extremamente precisa, a altura da superf\u00edcie do mar pode ser calculada com uma precis\u00e3o de apenas alguns cent\u00edmetros. Altimetria tamb\u00e9m pode determinar a altura de onda e velocidade do vento sobre o oceano, bem como a altura da superf\u00edcie de lagos e rios, informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre campo de gravidade da Terra, o gelo do mar e a calota de gelo presente na topografia.\nSensores altim\u00e9tricos estiveram presentes nos sat\u00e9lites Seasat em 1978, Geosat 19851988, ERS-1 e 2, de 1991, Topex / Poseidon, de 1992, e Jason de 2001. Os dados do alt\u00edmetro t\u00eam sido utilizados para produzir mapas de m\u00e9dias mensais de alturas de onda e a variabilidade da densidade de energia das ondas no tempo e no espa\u00e7o. Estes dados tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o utilizados com os programas de previs\u00e3o de ondas, para aumentar a precis\u00e3o das previs\u00f5es de ondas.\nOs dados de altura significativa de swell e per\u00edodo de pico de swell, para os artigos 2 e 3, foram obtidos atrav\u00e9s do espectro direcional de ondas adquiridos pelo sensor ASAR do sat\u00e9lite ENVISAT.\nO sat\u00e9lite ENVISAT foi lan\u00e7ado em mar\u00e7o de 2002 pela Ag\u00eancia Espacial Europeia com instrumentos que pudessem substituir os dados enviados pelo sat\u00e9lite ERS, seu antecessor. O principal objetivo do ENVISAT foi fornecer dados da atmosfera, do oceano, da terra e do gelo, visando o monitoramento do aquecimento global, do grau de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica\ne dos riscos de desastres naturais. O ENVISAT possui dez instrumentos a bordo, divididos entre sensores \u00f3pticos e sensores ativos, sendo seu principal sensor \u00f3ptico o MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) e seu principal sensor ativo o ASAR. A miss\u00e3o do sat\u00e9lite ENVISAT terminou em 08 de abril de 2012, ap\u00f3s a inesperada perda de contato com o sat\u00e9lite.\nO sensor ASAR \u00e9 uma vers\u00e3o aprimorada do instrumento SAR que j\u00e1 estava em opera\u00e7\u00e3o a bordo dos sat\u00e9lites ERS-1 e ERS-2; o ASAR tem uma antena de 10 m de comprimento, e operava em 5 modos distintos: modo de imagem, modo de polariza\u00e7\u00e3o alternada, modo de ampla faixa, modo de monitoramento global e modo de onda. Estes modos possuem resolu\u00e7\u00f5es variando de 25 km a 1 km, especialmente desenvolvidos para observar \u00e1reas continentais, \u00e1reas oce\u00e2nicas e calotas polares. Opera na banda C da faixa de micro-ondas do espectro eletromagn\u00e9tico. Tal sistema ilumina a superf\u00edcie da Terra e recebe o sinal retroespalhado por essa \u00e1rea, processando-o para sintetizar uma imagem de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial. Por operarem na faixa de micro-ondas e o radar fornecer sua pr\u00f3pria fonte de ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o tem a capacidade de realizarem medi\u00e7\u00f5es continuamente, sob qualquer condi\u00e7\u00e3o meteorol\u00f3gica.\nO sensor ASAR, no modo de onda, gera um tamanho m\u00ednimo de pequenas imagens, denominadas \"imagettes\", da superf\u00edcie do mar de 5 km x 5-10 km, semelhante ao ERS SAR, ao longo de 100 km da \u00f3rbita do sat\u00e9lite. Essas pequenas imagens s\u00e3o processadas para derivar os espectros de ondas da superf\u00edcie do mar e, consequentemente, o comprimento de onda, per\u00edodo, altura e dire\u00e7\u00e3o das ondas do mar.\n2.2\tModelo de gera\u00e7\u00e3o e propaga\u00e7\u00e3o de ondas\n2.2.1\tWAVEWATCH III\nO modelo WAVEWATCH III \u00e9 um modelo de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o desenvolvido pela NOAA/NCEP. Este modelo resolve a equa\u00e7\u00e3o do balan\u00e7o de a\u00e7\u00e3o para a energia espectral em termos de n\u00famero de onda k e dire\u00e7\u00e3o de onda 0, espa\u00e7o x e tempo t (TOLMAN, 1999). Admitindo-se a aus\u00eancia de corrente podemos expressar a equa\u00e7\u00e3o do balan\u00e7o a equa\u00e7\u00e3o do balan\u00e7o para a energia espectral como\nDE (k, x, \u00ed)\tciir flxi\u00c1 o.o.o\nDt\t= S(k, 0', x T) = Sin + Sn/ + SDs,\t(2.1)\nonde o lado esquerdo \u00e9 a taxa de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da densidade de energia dos componentes da onda que viaja com a velocidade de grupo. O lado direito representa os termos fonte para a equa\u00e7\u00e3o do balan\u00e7o energ\u00e9tico devido a entrada de energia do vento (Sin), transfer\u00eancia de energia n\u00e3o-linear por intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre as ondas (Sn/) e dissipa\u00e7\u00e3o (SDs). O pressuposto nesta equa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 que a escala de espa\u00e7o e tempo de ondas individuais s\u00e3o muito menores que as escala\ncorrespondentes \u00e0 varia\u00e7\u00e3o do espectro, das profundidades e correntes, quando consideradas.\n2.2.2\tSWAN\nSWAN \u00e9 um modelo de ondas de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o, desenvolvido na Delft University of Technology, para obten\u00e7\u00e3o de estimativas realistas de par\u00e2metros de ondas em \u00e1reas costeiras, lagos e estu\u00e1rios a partir de condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vento, batimetria e correntes (BOOIJ; RIS; HOLTHUIJ-SEN, 1999; RIS; HOLTHUIJSEN; BOOIJ, 1999). No entanto, SWAN pode ser usado em qualquer escala relevante para ondas de gravidade na superf\u00edcie gerada pelo vento.

The variability of ocean waves during the occurrence of extratropical cyclones in eastern south Atlantic, between 2001 and 2009 is examined. From a third-generation model, data of significant wave height, direction and wind speed were used to calculate the trajectories of cyclones based on the relative vorticity from its center. Altogether, 28 events were analyzed within this period. These were classified based on their trajectories in three patterns. To characterize the atmospheric conditions that originated these events was used reanalysis data. The highest values of maximum and average height were generated in the fall and winter with a higher incidence in May an pattern III being the most common. In addition, the extreme event of May 2001, generated by two simultaneous extracyclones caused a storm surge was analyzed in detail.\nKeywords: Ocean waves, extratropical cyclones, cyclone tracks, storm surge.\nResumo\nOs ciclones extratropicais geram grande influ\u00eancia na din\u00e2mica das ondas oce\u00e2nicas, intensificando-as e causando aumento das mar\u00e9s meteorol\u00f3gicas que causam eleva\u00e7\u00e3o an\u00f4mala do n\u00edvel do mar. A variabilidade das ondas oce\u00e2nicas durante a ocorr\u00eancia de ciclones extratropicais no Atl\u00e2ntico Sul Oriental, entre 2001 e 2009, \u00e9 examinada. A partir de um modelo de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o, dados de altura significativa, dire\u00e7\u00e3o e velocidade do vento foram utilizados para calcular as trajet\u00f3rias dos ciclones com base na vorticidade relativa do seu centro. No total, 28 eventos foram analisados nesse per\u00edodo. Estes foram classificados com base em suas trajet\u00f3rias em tr\u00eas padr\u00f5es. Para caracterizar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es atmosf\u00e9ricas que originaram esses eventos foram utilizados dados de rean\u00e1lise. Os valores mais altos de altura m\u00e1xima e m\u00e9dia foram gerados no outono e no inverno com maior incid\u00eancia em maio, sendo o padr\u00e3o III o mais comum.

This transfer is limited by the speed and duration of wind and the extent of the aqueous surface over which the wind is blowing. Thus, strong winds acts on the track, parallel to the coast, which intensifies when a center of low pressure is acting in conjunction with a central high pressure water in the coastal zone stack, while the low pressure associated with the cyclonic rotation increases the level of the ocean.\nAlthough, extensively studied in the northern hemisphere (HADLOCK; KREITZBERG, 1988; CATTO; SHAFFREY; HODGES, 2011; CHAMPION et al., 2011; BERNHARDT; DEGAETANO, 2012), there are fewer works on the behavior and characterization of extratropical cyclones in the southern hemisphere (SINCLAIR, 1994; SELUCHI, 1995; SINCLAIR, 1995), particularly in the south Atlantic.\nAn important aspect that has been attracting the attention of the scientific community recently is the classification of the extratropical cyclones in the South Atlantic. Gan e Rao (1991) analyzed 10 years of data (January 1979 - December 1988) where they observed two preferred cyclogenesis regions in South America: one near Uruguay's coast (31.5 \u00b0 S and 55 \u00b0 W), associated with the baroclinic instability due to the presence of the Andes to another over the Gulf of San Matias, Argentina, (42.5 \u00b0 S and 62.5 \u00b0 W), related to the baroclinic instability of the\nwesterlies. Rocha, Sugahara e Silveira (2004) analyzed six extratropical cyclones formed near the western South Atlantic between April and September 1999. They used hindcast information from third-generation wave model, showing wave heights up to 5 m in some events close to he Brazilian coast. Comparison with satellite altimeter data showed a systematic underestimation by 0.5 m of the significant wave height.\nParise, Calliari e Krusche (2009) analyzed twenty-three intense events storm tides between June 2006 and July 2007 in Cassino Beach, Brazil. According with their analysis, these extreme events have been more frequent in autumn and winter, with 35% prevalence in each of these two seasons of the year, followed by spring (17%) and summer (13%). They noticed that the SW winds occurred in 70% of the cases and were essential for the occurrence of elevations above sea level. These events were classified into three trajectory patterns: 1) cyclogenesis south of Argentina with a eastward shift of trajectory between 47.5 \u00b0 S and 57.5 \u00b0 S, 2) cyclogenesis to the south of Uruguay with eastward trajectory shift between 35 \u00b0 S and 42.5 \u00b0 S, 3) cyclogenesis in south of Uruguay with to shift to southeast and trajectory between 35 \u00b0 S and 57.5 \u00b0 S.\nDragani et al. (2010) investigated a possible increase in wave heights generated by wind in the southeastern continental shelf of South America between 32 \u00b0 S and 40 \u00b0 S. Using in situ time series (1996-2006) and annual average significant wave heights obtained by the satellite TOPEX (1993-2001), located on the continental shelf and in the adjacent ocean, they observed an apparently positive trend. The authors also implemented a version of the wave model SWAN forced with surface winds from the NCEP / NCAR in a regional domain for the period 1971-2005 for their study. The annual quadratic mean wave heights simulated showed significant positive trends in most of the inner shelf and in the adjacent ocean. They concluded that the most significant increase was observed between the years 80 and 90.\nBitencourt et al. (2011) examined intense wind events at the southern Brazilian coast associated with extratropical cyclones using wind speed observed at nine meteorological stations. They found that the winds are strongly associated with extratropical cyclones only south of 28 \u00b0 S.\nUsing a wave model with wind data reanalysis from 1979 to 2008, Machado et al. (2010), studied the wave energy in deep water (100 m) in the South Atlantic. The results indicated there were 40 extreme events (with at least 6 m wave height) in that period. Some of these events led to the erosion of 62.96 m3 / m and 1,8 m of elevation above sea level. They identified four synoptic generating patterns synoptic for these situations. Among the 40 events, 53.66% had a history of pattern II and 26.82% were related to pattern III, both representing 80% of the total.\nDragani et al. (2013) recently studied synoptic patterns associated with extreme wave conditions at the Rio de la Plata mouth using data series from 1996 to 2009. They identified 80\nevents with significant wave heights higher than 3.5 m in this period and selected 3 case studies which were classified according with three synoptic patterns. Nevertheless, the cyclones tracks that generated those patterns were not examined in details by the authors.\nThe event of May 2001 caused extensive damage to the coast of Santa Catarina where 11 counties were affected. Along with the coast of Santa Catarina, damages were reported on the coast of Paran\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. On the beach of Matinhos, in the state of Paran\u00e1, waves destroyed 19 homes and displaced about 35 families. About 4.5 km of coastline were hit hard by the wave force, and in some places the waves reached a height of 5 m and the sea has advanced 150 m to urban areas. On the coast of S\u00e3o Paulo, the sea invaded several neighborhoods of the cities of Santos and S\u00e3o Vicente, where the tide reached 1.5 m, according to the civil defense. Avenues, canals and storm sewers were clogged with lots of sand and some low walls were damaged or knocked down. Throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro, at least 160 families were left homeless. According to the newspapers, waves of 4 m were observed invading the streets and leaving lots of sand (INNOCENTINI; OLIVEIRA; Cunha Prado, 2003).\nIn the present work, we used data from 2001 to 2009 to analyze oceanography variables such as average and maximum significant wave height and wind speed and direction in a particular region of the South Atlantic which is vulnerable to the impact of extreme ocean waves and storm surges. In effect, we selected three locations on the south coast of Brazil possessing urban settlements, activities and residences very close to the ocean and thus very sensitive to its variability. There, the socioeconomic influences of the ocean intense events are therefore critical.\nThe contents of the article are the following. In the next section, we describe the dataset we used and explain the criteria to identify the extratropical cyclones trajectories. The general results and data are presented and discussed in the section 3.3. Next, we describe and quantify by means of wave and wind variables, the singular event that took place in May 2001 which combined two simultaneous cyclones and generated several damages on the coast, particularly in the city of Garopaba. This analysis was performed using the SWAN model and compared with satellite data. We offer a conclusion of the article in section 3.4.\n3.2\tData and methods\nThe data used were obtained by the processing of the model WAVEWATCH III (TOLMAN, 1999). These have been located at the site ftp://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/pub\n/history/waves. The period is from 2001 to 2009. This time interval has been chosen according with documentation of existing extreme events that occurred and affected mostly the state of Santa Catarina in Brazil. In table 1, all the events analyzed are listed.\nThe implementation of this model from which the data was extracted consider the entire globe as its domain with spatial resolution of 1 \u00b0 x 1.25 \u00b0 in latitude and longitude, respectively. The time step employed is 3 hours. Different wind fields are used and combined to force the wave system. These are available in intervals of 3 hour and obtained from the Global Data Assimilation Scheme (GDAS).\nIn order to calculate the cyclones tracks that occurred in the period of our interest, we used the zonal and meridional wind fields provided through the WAVEWATCH III output file, but generated by GDAS. The tracks, or trajectories, have been defined as a sequence of positions [x(t), y(t)], where t is counted from the first identification of the cyclone to its disappearance. This time interval considered for each particular event is the duration of the cyclone life (ROCHA; SUGAHARA; SILVEIRA, 2004). The trajectories were calculated with the sequence of relative vorticity (10, at the cyclone center, using the maximum negative vorticity of the geostrophic wind by using the formula Eq.(3.1)\nz\tdV10\tdU10\nS10 =\t,\t(3.1)\ndx\tdy\nwhere u10 e v10 are, respectively, the zonal and meridional components of wind measured at 10 m height with x representing the east-west, and y, the north-south direction. In order to better characterize the trajectory of systems that generate extremes, a threshold of vorticity less or equal to ((10) = -1,5 x 10-5 s-1 has been employed.\nThe Database Reanalysis Project R-1 NCEP / NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) was used to characterize the atmospheric conditions that originated events, primarily from May 2001. The zonal and meridional wind components were used at the 10 m height and atmospheric pressure, at mean sea level. Both quantities had spatial resolution of 2.5 \u00b0 x 2.5 \u00b0 and temporal resolution of 6 h (0000, 0600, 1200, 1800 UTC) (KALNAY et al., 1996).\n3.3\tResults and Discussion\nWe will focus on the analysis of the wave impacts at three places. Namely, the coastal cities of Rio Grande, Tramandai and Garopaba. These locations were chosen because their socioeconomical importance in southern Brazil and the wider impact to which they are subjected to by being near the field of action of extratropical cyclones. Their locations are represented in figures 1-3. In the next subsection we examine the events overall and in the subsection 3.3.2, a special attention is put on the singular event of May 2001.\n3.3.1\tGeneral View\nIn the period studied, we identify 28 extreme events associated to 28 ciclogenetic situations, occurring from latitude 30 \u00b0 S to latitude 55 \u00b0 S. The cyclones tracks can be classified into the three patterns proposed by Machado et al. (2010):\n\u2022Pattern I: Cyclogenesis at southern coast of Argentina moving eastward and track limited between latitudes 47.5 \u00b0 S and 57.5 \u00b0 S (Fig.3.1).\n\u2022Pattern II: Cyclogenesis at the south coast of Uruguay moving eastward with track limited between latitudes 28 \u00b0 S and 43 \u00b0 S (Fig.3.2).\n\u2022Pattern III: Cyclogenesis at south coast of Uruguay moving to southeast and tack between latitudes 32 \u00b0 S and 57.5 \u00b0 S (Fig.3.3).\nThe events are listed in Table 3.1, with the abovementioned patterns. The third event, occurred in May 2001, comprises two cyclones, but it is counted as a single event.\nFigure 3.1: Cyclones tracks Pattern I (A) and synoptic situation (B).\nFigure 3.2: Cyclones tracks Pattern II (A) and synoptic situation (B).\nFigures 3.1,3.2 and 3.3 show the trajectories of cyclones addition, synoptic characteristics for patterns I, II and III respectively. In the pattern I the low pressure center is located between\nTable 3.1: Events dates and their classification.\nEvents\tMonth\tYear\tPattern\n1\t1\t2001\tII\n2\t2\t2001\tII\n3\t5\t2001\tCyclone 1 II Cyclone 2 III\n4\t7\t2001\tIII\n5\t10\t2001\tI\n6\t11\t2001\tI\n7\t2\t2002\tIII\n8\t9\t2002\tIII\n9\t5\t2003\tII\n10\t5\t2003\tII\n11\t2\t2004\tII\n12\t3\t2004\tI\n13\t5\t2004\tIII\n14\t9\t2004\tI\n15\t5\t2005\tIII\n16\t8\t2005\tIII\n17\t6\t2006\tI\n18\t9\t2006\tIII\n19\t7\t2007\tIII\n20\t5\t2008\tII\n21\t6\t2008\tI\n22\t10\t2008\tII\n23\t11\t2008\tI\n24\t2\t2009\tIII\n25\t4\t2009\tIII\n26\t8\t2009\tIII\n27\t10\t2009\tI\n28\t12\t2009\tII\nLongitude (0)\nFigure 3.3: Cyclones tracks Pattern III (A) and synoptic situation (B).\ntwo high pressure centers, one on the continent and another farther away in the open ocean. The presence of high pressure in the center of the continent contributes to the formation of a track with wind SW direction which contributes to the stacking of water in the coastal region by the effect of Ekmann. In pattern II the low pressure center is close to the shore causing the winds generated by Hurricane act directly on it. Consequently the cyclone remains longer near the coast and, therefore, the impact is more specific. And the pattern III the low pressure center moves to SE creating a trail toward SW wind.\nThe patterns III, II and I occur in 41.4%, 31% and 27.6% of the cases, respectively. We also observed that they occur more frequently in autumn (35.7%) and spring (25%) with 21.4% recorded in May alone. This higher frequency in autumn is associated with stronger winds from the south of Brazil at the time of the year (PARISE; CALLIARI; KRUSCHE, 2009). Figure 3.4 shows the prevailing winds in the three trajectory patterns for the three locations studied. For the pattern I the wind from NE prevailed in three locations, with the specific aspects that in Garopaba also occurred in the presence of N and S winds and Rio Grande, SE winds can be observed. In pattern II, winds from SW prevailed for three locations. In Garopaba, winds from N are also observed. In TramandaG winds from S and E and in Rio Grande, winds from S. For pattern III, wind from SW prevailed in Garopaba, W-SW in Tramanda\u00ed and S-SW in Rio Grande.\nAccording to the figures of Table 3.2 we see that the highest values of average and maximum heights are associated with patterns II and III. The highest values of wind speed occurred in patterns II and III (Fig. 3.4). Parise, Calliari e Krusche (2009) analyzed 23 events for the Cassino Beach (RS) and noticed that the SW winds occurred in 70% of cases and were essential for the occurrence of elevations above sea level. Observing the wave height maximum and average values, we found that the larger values are associated with the patterns II and III (Table 3.2).\nThe higher values of average and maximum height were generated by events: 7, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 28. Among them, the events 10, 14, 18 and 28 showed very little variation between the average and maximum heights. The events with the largest wave heights occurred\nmore frequently in May, and in these events, pattern III occurs more frequently (50%). With respect to the wind velocity, the events 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 19 and 20 produced the largest values of maximum and mean velocity. In these events, pattern III again occurs with highest frequency (42,9%).\n(a)\t(b)\t(c)\n(d)\t(e)\t(f)\n(g)\n(h)\nFigure 3.4: Wind direction and speed for the three patterns, on the studied locations.\n(i)\nTable 3.2: Mean and maxima wave heights.\n\tPattern I\tPattern II\tPattern III\nMean Garopaba\t2.19\t2.77\t2.77\nMaximum Garopaba\t3.73\t5.36\t5.01\nMean Tramandai\t1.66\t2.07\t2.17\nMaximum Tramandai\t2.77\t3.88\t3.52\nMean Rio Grande\t1.82\t2.07\t2.37\nMaximum Rio Grande\t2.92\t3.76\t3.78\nTozzi e Calliari (1999) described four major classes of storms to the coast of Rio Grande do\nSul (Table 3.3).

This classification agrres with the patterns of trajectories presented in this work.\n3.3.2\tEvent of May 2001 (Event 3)\nBecause of its singular aspects, the third event, occurred in May 2001, will be described separately. This is associated with the simultaneous occurrence of two cyclones in most of the duration of the event. These cyclones which generated a severe storm surge that hit the coast of Santa Catarina. Elevated values of maximum and average significant wave height and wind velocity have been registered in the three locations, particularly in the region of Garopaba, as shown in Figure 3.5 and 3.6. Figure 3.8 shows the two tracks followed by the tropical cyclones, named here as cyclone 1 and cyclone 2. The first originated in latitude 39 \u00b0 S on 02/05/2001 and the second, at latitude 27 \u00b0 S on 04/05/2001. The first cyclone formed at a latitude away from the second. However, this generated a track wind along the coast who met the track formed by the second cyclone which probably potentiated the effect and intensity of the storm surge that hit the state of Santa Catarina. According to Innocentini, Oliveira e Cunha Prado (2003), the wave field intensivity was caused by the combined effect of these two tropical cyclones, since individually each cyclone and would not have the necessary fetch and duration to cause waves that intensity.\nBecause of the fact of the occurrence of two simultaneous extratropical cyclones this event was highlighted and its period of operation was simulated in waters near the coast using the SWAN model.\n3.3.3\tModel description\nSWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) is a model of third generation wave to obtain realistic estimates of wave parameters in coastal areas, lakes and estuaries from wind data, bathymetry and currents (BOOIJ; RIS; HOLTHUIJSEN, 1999; RIS; HOLTHUIJSEN; BOOIJ, 1999). The model is based on equilibrium equation of wave action. This equation includes each term source: wind input, the nonlinear interactions, white-capping, friction in the background and induced break deep. In this study we used the 41.01 version of the SWAN model.\nThe grid used in the southern region is curvilinear and has 305 956 (892 x 343) cells with high resolution of approximately 0.5 km off the coast and low resolution of approximately 1.5 km\nin deep water, rotated at 45o (Fig. 3.7). The area is approximately 286 000 km2, covering the entire coastal area of Rio Grande do Sul and part of Uruguay and the state of Santa Catarina. The bathymetry for this grid is composed only of data of the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) resolution of 30\" x 30\". The model was used in non stationary way, with a 5 minute time step and wind data input every 3 hours.\nFigure 3.7: Study area showing the grid used for the simulation of the event 3.\nBased on the elements described above, cyclone 1 belongs to the pattern III and Cyclone 2 to the pattern II. According Parise, Calliari e Krusche (2009), in the pattern II, a cyclone remains close to shore for longer, which causes a more localized impact. On the other hand, pattern III is responsible for a bigger rise in sea level (Machado et al. 2011). In the city of Rio Grande, wave heights varied between 0.7 and 2.28 m, in Tramandai, between 0.53 and 2.13 m and in Garopaba, between 0.58 and 2.8 m (Fig. 3.11). We can observe that the increase is significant wave height occur from south to north along the southern coast of Brazil. In Rio Grande the largest wave heights occurred on 05.05.2001 at 07 h, in Tramandai on 07.05.2001 at 13 h and Garopaba the peak was observed on 06.05.2001 at 07 h. The wind speed showed values between 3 and 12 m / s in Rio Grande, between 2.8 and 11 m / s in Tramandai and between 0.6 and 15.3 m / s in Garopaba (Fig 3.12). Winds from S-SW were predominant in Rio Grande, Tramandai and Garopaba (Fig. 3.13a, 3.13b and 3.13c). In the Rio Grande maximum wind speed occurred on 02.05.2001 at 13 h, in Tramandai on 05.05.2001 at 01 h and in Garopaba, on 05.05.2001 at 19 h. The astronomical tide for the state of Rio Grande do Sul is classified as mixed semi-diurnal, with average amplitude of about 0.4 m (CALLIARI; TOZZI; KLEIN, 1998). Thus the events described may have been magnified and intensified because the meteorological tide in the region has high typical values.\nTo check the significant height and wind speed data obtained by the SWAN model, these form compared with satellite data obtained by altimetry. The comparison period corresponds to the days of operation of the two cyclones.

Instead there was an underestimation of model values relative to the satellite values for significant wave height data and the wind speed.\nUsing data from the Superintendence of Ports and Waterways (SPH), we obtained a maxi-\nFigure 3.12: Wind speed for the three locations during the event of May 2001.\nmum level rise from meteorological forcing (storm surge) of 0.64 m for the region Tramandai on 05.05.2001 at 12:30 h, where the pressure in the center of the cyclone was 998.9 mbar. The value of storm surge for other locations was not calculated, since no data were available.\nSynoptic features\nThe first cyclone originated on day 02 near latitude 40 \u00b0 S (Fig. 3.14a) shifting to southeast (Pattern III). On day 03, the winds intensified towards SW (Fig. 3.14b). This day was the lowest pressure recording in the center of the cyclone of 990 mbar and from day 04, the winds associated took the SE direction (Fig. 3.14c). Another low pressure center near latitude 27 \u00b0 S also observed which moves eastward (Pattern II). On day 05, trail wind near the coast (Fig. 3.14d) was formed and it was intensified in the days 06 and 07 (Fig. 3.14e and Fig. 3.14f), when the lowest pressure recorded in the center of the cyclone was 998 mbar, losing power in the next two days (Fig. 3.14g and Fig. 3.14h).\n3.4\tConclusions\nWe have calculated the tracks of extatropical cyclones and classified them into 3 patterns. Pattern III is the most common (41.4%) with a higher incidence of events appearing in May. This agrees with the period of largest number of occurrences of coastal storms, as observed by Gan e Rao (1991). It was found that the prevailing winds of the patterns I, II and III were, respectively,\n(a) Rio Grande\n(b) Tramanda\u00ed\n(c) Garopaba\nFigure 3.13: Wind direction and speed of the event of May 2001 in: a) Rio Grande, b) Tramandai and c) Garopaba.\n(a)\t(b)\t(c)\t(d)\nFigure 3.14: Synoptic situation of atmospheric pressure at sea level (mbar) and wind field (m/s) each hour for the event in May 2001.\nNE, SW and SW in all three locations. The highest values of mean and maximum wave height are associated with patterns II and III, which are the most erosive and that generate the highest elevations in the sea level, respectively.\nWith the tracks calculated and classified into the three patterns, we determined the total number of events and analyzed the characteristics of significant wave heights and wind in the cities of Rio Grande, Tramanda\u00ed and Garopaba. We found that the largest values of wave heights are associated with patterns II and III (87.5%), especially the latter.\nConsidering the 28 events, we obtained a good overall correlation between data of significant wave height and wind speed. However, in some cases, associated with greatest significant wave heights, this correlation was not present. This may be related to the extension of the runway wind, as well as the duration of the wind, which varied significantly during the storm.\nThe event number 3, of May 2001 stood out from the others by presenting the simultaneous occurrence of two cyclones and by causing major damage to the coastlines in several cities. This event generated significantly higher values of maximum and average wave height. We have found that wave height and wind speed were significantly higher in the region of Garopaba, during the event. There was also evidence of a storm surge in the state of Santa Catarina. We found also that the event of May 2001 produced maximum significant wave height that overcame in roughly 10% all the other events (with exception to event 28) in all 11 years analyzed. These observations suggest the study of phenomena with similar characteristics of event 3 as a future topic investigation.\nAcknowledgements\nThe first author acknowledges financial support by CAPES, Brazil, through the Project Edital Capes Ci\u00eancias do Mar 09/2009.

In its so called wave mode, small areas of around 5 by 5 km are imaged along the satellite ground track, yielding thousands of wave spectra per orbit with global coverage. Our knowledge about wave climate and wave propagation has increased substantially since the launch of ERS-1 in the early 1990s (see a thoroughly discussion about the SAR wave mode in Hasselmann et al. (2013)).\nInvestigations about wave climate have increased and satellite data have been increasingly employed. Satellite observations have a global coverage and also provide information with a high level of accuracy. Along with satellite data, numerical modelling can be used as a tool for providing numerical predictions. Despite the irregular spatial and temporal coverage of satellite wave data, these records are supposedly the closest measurements to the true sea state. The results of a model for forecasting or hindcasting wave fields provide a regular, homogeneous field in time and space. However, they are subject to many uncertainties, such as the quality of wind input and the model physics and configuration. Thus, a comparison of data obtained by satellite with the model data model becomes very useful to determine the real sea state.\nYoung (1999) examined a data set covering a 10-year period acquired from a combination of satellite data and model predictions obtained in order to establish wind and wave global climates. The results were presented in terms of average monthly statistics for significant wave height, peak and average wave period, wave direction and wind speed and direction. The results clearly showed zonal variation for the wind speed and wave height, to extreme conditions that occur at high latitudes. It was observed that the swell generated from storms in the Southern Ocean penetrates across the Indian Ocean, South Pacific and South Atlantic. During the southern hemisphere winter, the swell still enters the North Pacific. It was also found that the western side of most continents have noticeably more intense wave climates than the east side; this is a result\nof the generation of longer fetches that exist on the West Coast and the direction of propagation of prevailing winds.\nReguero et al. (2012) used a global set of wave data from 1948 to 2008. Employing a calibration method, the data set have been fixed based on altimeter data from 1992 to 2008. The quality of the corrected results were compared with measurements from buoy and satellite altimeter. The diagnostic statistics showed an agreement both with scatter data as the statistical distribution of wave heights, indicating that the reanalysis adequately reflects the characteristics of the waves from satellite data between 1992 and 2008.\nA feasibility study to use wind speed and significant wave height measurements of simultaneous sources of scatterometer and altimeter satellite to observe the pattern of spatial and seasonal distribution of the dominant areas of swell and wind in all oceans has been proposed by Chen et al. (2002). Two normalised indices related to energy were presented. Based on these, global probability and intensity statistics for swell and wind were obtained. Regions with intense wave growth were observed in the Pacific, Northwest Atlantic, Southern Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The observed seasonality is somewhat different between the climates of swell and wind.\nAn analysis using a set of satellite altimeter data was carried out by Izaguirre et al. (2011), which provided a global comprehensive level for the year of 1992. An analysis of non-stationary extreme values, modelling the seasonal and inter annual variations was employed to characterise extreme significant wave height.\nRen et al. (2011) compared six years of ENVISAT satellite ASAR spectrum data with onedimensional wave spectra obtained from 44 buoys in the Northern Pacific. They found that the ASAR wave spectra tend to significantly underestimate the significant wave heights at high wind speeds and overestimate them at low wind speeds.\nENVISAT level 2 (ASA _WVW_2P) wave spectra data were compared with other altimeter and buoys measurements, located in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific Ocean, and with wave models by Li e Saulter (2012). This indirect comparison was made for 14 months, from November 2007 to December 2008. The ASAR swell data proved to be consistent with the model and buoy data.\nStopa et al. (2016) used synthetic aperture radar data to identify swell sources and trajectories, allowing a statistically significant estimation of swell dissipation. They employed the whole ENVISAT mission (2003 - 2012) to find suitable storms with swells (with periods T such that 13 &lt;T &lt;18 s) that were observed several times along their propagation. The analysis reveals that swell dissipation weakly correlates with the wave steepness, wind speed, orbital wave velocity, and the relative direction of wind and waves. Although several negative dissipation rates\nare found, there are uncertainties in the SAR-derived swell heights and dissipation rates. An acceptable range of the swell-dissipation rate is -0.1 to 6 x 10-7 m-1 with a median of 1 x 10-7 m-1.\nOne of the shortcomings of data obtained by satellite is the irregular spatial distribution inherent to these. In this work, we present an algorithm that reallocate the wave data in a uniform grid without the use of averages. Thus, only actual, ponctual measured values are plotted and analysed.\nIn this work we used global data for the whole year of 2007. The data used was the directional wave spectra (ASA _WVW_2P) obtained by the ENVISAT satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA) through the ASAR sensor. These data were compared with WAVEWATCH III (WW3) model data, developed for the same period. The ocean variable analysed is swell for a global grid.\nIn the next section we describe the data set used. In section 4.3, we present give details of the algorithm for the uniform data representation while the overall results on the wave fields are presented and discussed in section 4.4. The conclusion remarks of the article are given in section 4.5.\n4.2\tSatellite and model wave data\nIn this section we describe the data we have worked with.\n4.2.1\tSatellite data\nENVISAT was launched in March 2002 by the European Space Agency to follow on its predecessors ERS-1 &amp; 2. Its main objective was to provide atmosphere, ocean, land and ice data at monitoring global warming, the degree of air pollution and natural disaster risks. ENVISAT carried ten instruments on board, with optical sensors and active sensors, and among them its main asset, the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) sensor. The ENVISAT mission ended on 8 April 2012, following the unexpected loss of contact with the satellite.\nThe ASAR sensor is an enhanced version of the SAR instrument that was already in operation on board satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2. This has a 10 m long antenna, and operates in five different modes: image mode, mode alternating polarisation wide band mode, monitor mode, and global wave mode. The sensor in wave mode produces small 5 km x 5-10 km images, called imagettes, of the sea surface. These images are processed to derive the wave spectrum of the sea surface and hence the wavelength, period, height and direction of the waves. The processing\nof Level 2 data uses an algorithm developed and implemented by IFREMER/CERSAT ((JOHNSEN et al., 2006)).\n4.2.2\tThe wave model\nThe WW3 wave model (TOLMAN, 1999) developed by NOAA / NCEP solves the spectral action energy conservation equation. The physical model includes wave growth, dissipation due to wave breaking in the background, refraction, advection and nonlinear interactions.\nIn our implementation, the WW3 model is used with spatial resolution of 0.6 \u00b0 x 0.6\u00b0 for latitude and longitude respectively and temporal resolution of 3 hours. The simulations are performed in a global domain 70 \u00b0 S to 70 \u00b0 N and 0 to 360 \u00b0 E. As input the surface wind components (U and V) predictions and ice cover calculated by the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) are used.\nWe used data from the spectral partitions provided by the model. The WW3 model has both point and field output options available to provide quantitative descriptions of these individual spectral partitions. The analysis of the wave system described in (HANSON; PHILLIPS, 2001) is applied.\nThe spectral partitioning method subdivides the directional spectrum into a number of overlapping wave components (partitions), each of which can be characterised by average parameters such as significant height, mean frequency, direction of propagation, and directional scattering.\nRegardless of the method used, all the partitioning schemes follow the following logic: isolation of the peaks of energy, identification and combination of peaks of energy, removal of partitions with low energy and statistics of the main parameters of waves.\n4.3\tUniform spatial representation\nThe allocation of the satellite data, which is irregular in space, into a regular mesh is carried out by an algorithm with two procedures. The first rearrange the satellite data onto the model regular grid, placing the satellite data closest to its original irregular coordinates. When two satellite measurements are found, within the specified period of time (taken here as one month), in the same cell of the model mesh, the largest measured value is selected. Let Vsat 0Rg(x, t) denote the variable V measured by the satellite at a point (x, t) = (x, y, t) on latitude x, longitude y and time t. Let also lat(/), lon(J) be the latitudes and longitudes of the model's horizontal physical mesh of size N x M. This algorithm generates a regular submesh of size NB x MB,\nwhich can coincide with the model original mesh, particularly when the amount of satellite data over one month is sufficiently large and homogeneously distributed.\nProcedure 1 is described below.\nData: Satellite data over a month and model mesh\nResult: Satellite data Vsat-reg arranged on regular submesh\nfor (x, t) g Sat. global domain x one month do\ncount (I, J) = False;\nfor I =1,... N - 1, j =1,..., M - 1 do\nif x > lat(I) and x &lt;lat(I + 1) and y > lon(j) and y &lt;lon(J + 1) then\nif count (I, j) = true then\nif Vsat-reg(I, j, date(l, j)) &lt;Vsat-orig(X, t) then\ndate(i, j) = t;\nVsat-reg(I, j, date(I, j)) = Vsat-orIg (x, T)\nelse\n| increment I; j\nend\nelse\ndate(I, j) = t;\nVsat-reg(I, j, date(I, j)) = Vsat-orIg(x, T) ;\ncount (I, j) = true\nend\nend\nend\nend\nProcedure 1: Reallocate satellite data in regular mesh.\nThe second procedure compares the dates of the satellite measurements with model dates. This selects only the model dates that have a corresponding date with the satellite. Let k = 1,..., T be the dates computed by the model during the month under study. Algorithm 2 is described as follows.\nData: Dates where satellite data exists, spatial submesh and model temporal mesh Result: Model data Vmod-reg on the submesh and on selected dates\nfor k = 1,..., T do\nfor i = 1,... NB - 1, J = 1,..., MB - 1 do if date(i, J) > k and date(i, J) &lt;k + 1 then\n| Vmod-reg(i, J, date(i, J)) = Vmod-orig(i, J, k)\nend\nend\nend\nProcedure 2: Selects the valid dates on the model data.\nAs a result of the algorithm, the variables Vmod-reg and Vsat-reg can then be compared on the same spatio-temporal framework. In our comparison, we have computed swell height.\n4.4\tSwell Height\nTo analyse the data obtained from ENVISAT, through the ASAR sensor, we carried out a comparison with data obtained by the WW3 model. The swell height was obtained and simulated for the whole year of 2007. For the graphical presentation of results, we selected a single month for each of the four seasons.\nBesides the values of swell heights, we also computed the bias Eq.(4.1) and the scattering index Eq.(4.2) from our dataset. Specifically, we have used:\nV = M - S,\n/n rn=,_(M, - s,)2 s\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\nwhere V is the bias, SI is the scatter index and n is the number of observations. M stands for\nmodel and S for satellite satellite measurements. The bar over S represents spatial average.\nEach value of the swell height, as well as the bias and the scatter index is represented by a pixel, with its corresponding latitude and longitude, in the maps of all figures below.\nThe satellite wavelength measurements range is 100-400 m, which is equivalent to periods of 8-16 s. Thus we selected a corresponding data by the model which originally computes a wider range of periods, greater than 16 s and less than 8 s.\nIt is observed from the satellite and model data in figures 4.1 and 4.2 that the largest values of swell height are located near latitude 60 \u00b0 for both the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and the Northern Hemisphere (NH), corroborating with previous findings on ocean wave climate (YOUNG, 1999; IZAGUIRRE et al., 2011). In the months corresponding to winter and fall,\nin the respective hemispheres, these values intensify. Analysing both dataset we notice that the\n(a)\n(b)\nSwell February 2007 Satellite\nSwell February 2007 WW3\nFigure 4.1: Global distributions of swell height in meters by the satellite and model for the months of February and April, 2007.\nSH show a significant rougher sea state than the NH. In particular, stronger swell fields are observed in the South Pacific, Southern Africa and Southern and Eastern Australia in the autumn and winter of the SH. Important high swell also occur in the Southwestern Atlantic and is seen from the model data of April (figure 4.1) and in the model and satellite data of July (figure 4.2). These fields are associated with the frequent occurrence of extra-tropical cyclones in the South America, in the fall of the SH. In the NH, the highest waves are found in the North Pacific and North Atlantic during the winter, as shown in figure 4.1.\nSatellite measurements show very clearly high swell heights in the Northwestern Indian Ocean in the North Hemisphere late spring (June) and summer (figure 4.2). This can be explained by strong southwest winds that develops near the coast of Africa and is associated with the Asian summer monsoon Asian (YOUNG, 1999). The negative bias of July in this region, shown in figure 4.3, indicates the model did not accurately pick up this phenomenon. The largest bias in the comparison satellite-model, presented in figure 4.3, were observed at high latitudes, spe-\n(a)\t(b)\nSwell October 2007 Satellite\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5 E\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nSwell October 2007 WW3\nFigure 4.2: Global distributions of swell height in meters by the satellite and model for the months of July and October, 2007.\ncially in the SH. In figure 4.4, we see that the scatter index is below 0.5, almost everywhere. In some regions, these values were close to 1. Higher values (greater than 1) were observed in the North Atlantic, South Pacific and Northern Australia.\nThe bias we found presents complex characteristics for the year analysed. We could infer that from the months of between February and April, the highest values of bias, meaning overestimation by the model, are predominantly positive with a remarkable exception in regions of the Atlantic in latitude range 40-45o S and also in 40-45o N, including the North Pacific. In the months of July and October, the same extra-tropical range show underestimation by the model in the Atlantic, and South Indian Ocean. In the tropics, our results show less intense but more extensive areas with negative bias, and thus model underestimation of swell heights apparently contradicting previous findings of systematic overestimation of wave heights by numerical wave models (RASCLE et al., 2008). This may be related to the fact that in the algorithm used in this work, when more than one satellite measurement is found in the same cell of the model mesh for the same period of time, taken here as one month, the highest value is selected and a new\nvalue computed by the model is also picked up within the shortest time tolerance. Thus, this procedure is done without compromising the nearness in time for each two values compared.\n(a)\n(b)\nBias Swell February 2007\nFigure 4.3: Global bias for all four seasons of 2007.\nScatter Index Swell April 2007\nScatter Index Swell February 2007\nFigure 4.4: Global scattering index for all four seasons of 2007.\n4.5\tConclusions\nIn this work an algorithm for representing irregular satellite wave data in a uniform mesh has been introduced. This procedure also allows the comparison between satellite and model data in the same point in space and time.\nENVISAT swell heights, obtained through the ASAR sensor have been compared with the swell computed by the WaveWatchlll. As an propositional work, a short-scale simulation of the wave model were performed for the entire year of 2007 and results for a month of each season have been analysed through bias and scatter index.\nKnown features of the global wave climate have been corroborated as well as specific findings for the year studied. In special, higher latitude regions where the model underestimate the measured swell heights have been identified. Further, it has been noticed that in the tropics, less intense but more extensive areas also present negative bias, and thus model underestimation of swell heights. These findings should provide additional insights for the ocean wave modelling community and indication of future model improvements and calibration.\nThe features of the uniform satellite representation introduced here must be further investigated and extended to other physical variables such as wave period and direction and a similar study as the one presented here should be carried out using a more comprehensive dataset, incorporating several years.\nAcknowledgements\nThe first author acknowledges financial support by CAPES, Brazil, through the Project Edital Capes Ci\u00eancias do Mar 09/2009.

For this purpose the use of predictive models as well as satellite data have increased, as these are methods with low operating costs compared to field measurements. Thus, a comparison of data obtained by satellite with the model data used as a model input parameter serves as conditions to ascertain the accuracy of these measurements.\nComparisons between satellite data and mathematical models are common; for instance recent studies focused on the Australian region (GREENSLADE, 2001), Pacific Ocean (REN et al., 2011) and on the global domains (LI; HOLT, 2009; LI; SAULTER, 2012). In the South Atlantic, much fewer studies were carried out.\nRocha, Sugahara e Silveira (2004) analysed six extra-tropical cyclones formed in the Southwes\ntern Atlantic between April and September 1999. Using past events data from a third-generation wave model, they found values of wave heights up to 5 m during some events near the Brazilian coast. The comparison with the satellite altimetry data showed a systematic underestimation of 0.5 m in the significant wave height, relative to the model.\nPo\u00e7as et al. (2010) conducted a comparison of the directional wave spectra derived from radar images of the ENVISAT satellite with data from the wave model WAVEWATCH III (TOLMAN, 1999) and two buoys off the coast of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, in southern Brazil. There was a substantial correlation between the significant wave height data measured in situ by buoys, WAVEWATCH III output and those obtained by digital processing of SAR images. However, the peak period values showed some disparity between the measurements from buoys and satellite and also between the data model and satellite. Thus, the bias and mean square error are greater.\nUsing the wave model SWAN, Guimar\u00e3es, Farina e Toldo Jr. (2014), simulated extreme events generated by extratropical cyclones in the South Atlantic in the period 2000-2010 to check the impact on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. They compared the model with buoy data and statistical results showed that all three analysed wave parameters; significant wave height, peak period and direction peak had a good match with the reality in most of the cases studied, with correlation coefficients between 0.79 and 0.85. Six events during the study period showed significant wave heights above 5 m and it is found that the cyclogenetic pattern between latitudes\n31.5\t\u00b0 and 34 \u00b0 S is the most favourable for the development of high waves.\nThis work aims at verifying and comparing the behaviour of wave parameters near two coastal regions of Brazil using the model SWAN with boundary data provided by the ocean wave model WAVEWATCH III and by ENVISAT. This analysis was conducted in the southern and northeastern coastal regions of Brazil during events with predominant swell.\nThe reason to use events which swell waves were prevalent is because of the fact that the ENVISAT satellite measures the directional spectrum of long waves only. For the selection of events, a sweep in the WAVEWATCH III data (ftp://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/history/ waves) were performed in the period of the years 2002-2010 with events where the wavelength ranged in the interval (100,400) m which is equivalent to wave periods in about (8,16) s. Furthermore, we also required average significant wave heights to be greater than 2 m, in the selection.\n5.2\tStudy area\n5.2.1\tSouth region of Brazil\nThe coast of Rio Grande do Sul state is characterised by a broad coastal plain of approximately 615 km featuring a NE-SW orientation (DILLENBURG et al., 2000). It consists of unconsolidated quaternary deposits that do not have modern sands contributions from the continent. The continental shelf has 150-200 km wide, with maximum depths ranging from 100 to 140 m, and gentle slopes of 0.03 \u00b0 to 0.08 \u00b0. The shoreface is wide and shallow with an outer boundary at a depth of 10-15 m, with a predominance of sandy sediments (Toldo Jr et al., 2006). Because it is an open coast without a natural hedge, this is vulnerable to the action of waves, characterised by dominant swell generated in the South Atlantic and also by sea waves.\nCuchiara et al. (2009) obtained a characterisation of the wave climate based on a thorough review of existing field data and numerical modelling experiments. They found that wave regime in southern Brazilian shelf is characterised by waves of predominant directions of 100 \u00b0 and 160 \u00b0 with average significant wave heights ranging from 1 to 1.50m. The wave period varies between 6 and 14 s with a predominance of 8 s for sea and 12 s for swell.\n5.2.2\tNortheast region of Brazil\nThe Northeast region was chosen because part of its coast is susceptible to swell events originated in distant areas of the North Atlantic.\nSedimentation is influenced by semi-arid climate in the coastal zone, resulting in a reduced contribution to the river shore, with a small amount of silty-clay material transported (Maia, 1998). The current sedimentation is mainly carbonate with no hermatypic coral (CARANNANTE et al., 1988).\nAccording to Innocentini et al. (2001), the incident waves in the northeastern region are formed by trade winds and feature height below 1-1.5 m in open sea. Occasionally waves with periods between 15 and 20 s may rise coming from the North Atlantic storms. This region consists of local waves originated by the trade winds and swell generated by tropical cyclones in both hemispheres (INNOCENTINI et al., 2005).\n5.3\tMaterials and methods\n5.3.1\tModel description\nSWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) is a wave model of third generation for realistic estimates of wave parameters in coastal areas, lakes and estuaries from wind data, bathymetry and currents (BOOIJ; RIS; HOLTHUIJSEN, 1999; RIS; HOLTHUIJSEN; BOOIJ, 1999). The model is based on the balance wave action equation. This equation includes source terms for wind input, nonlinear interactions, white-capping, friction with the bottom and wave breaking. In this study, we used the 41.01 version of the SWAN model and two grids; one in the south and another in the northeast of Brazil.\nThe grid used in the southern region is curvilinear and has 275200 (800 x 344) cells with a higher resolution of 0.5 km off the coast and lower resolution of 1.5 km in deep water, rotated at 45 \u00b0 (Figure 5.1). The domain area is approximately 250000 km2, covering the entire coast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Santa Catarina and part of Uruguay. The bathymetry used for this grid was a combination of ETOPO1 model data with resolution of 1' x 1' (AMANTE; EAKINS, 2009) with nautical charts available from DHN / CHM (Brazil Navy) (https://www.mar.mil.br/dhn/chm/box-cartas-nauticas/cartas.html) which was obtained by using model data and the Oceanographic Observation Network (REMO).\nIn the northeast, the grid is also curvilinear with higher resolution near the coast and lower in deep water, having 524880 (1215 x 432) cells. This grid involves the entire coasts of the states of Piau\u00ed and Cear\u00e1, and part of the states of Maranh\u00e3o and Rio Grande do Norte (Figure 5.1). The bathymetry for this grid is composed only of data of the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) with resolution of 30'' x 30''.\nThe model was executed in non stationary mode, with 5 minute time step and wind data input every 3 hours.\n5.3.2\tSatellite data\nThe ENVISAT satellite was launched in March 2002 by the European Space Agency with instruments that could substitute the data sent by the satellite ERS, his predecessor. The main objective of ENVISAT data was to provide atmosphere, ocean, land and ice data, aimed at monitoring global warming, the degree of air pollution and natural disaster risks. ENVISAT had ten instruments on board, divided between optical sensors and active sensors, with its main optical sensor being MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) and its main asset, the ASAR sensor. The ENVISAT mission ended on 08 April 2012, after the unexpected loss of\nFigure 5.1: Study area with two grids in the southern and northeastern regions. The dots show the cities of reference for this study.\ncontact with the satellite.\nThe ASAR sensor was an enhanced version of the SAR instrument that was already in operation on board satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2: The ASAR had a 10 m long antenna, and operated in five different modes: image mode, mode alternating polarisation wide band mode, monitor mode, and global wave mode. These modes had resolutions ranging from 25 km to 1 km, specially developed to observe continental areas, ocean areas and polar ice caps. The sensor in wave mode generated small images, called \"imagettes\"of the surface of the sea with 5 km x 5-10 km, similar to ERS SAR, over 100 km of the satellite orbit. These small images were processed to derive the wave spectrum of the sea surface and hence the wavelength, period, height and direction of the waves. The processing of Level 2 data used an algorithm developed and implemented by IFREMER / CERSAT (JOHNSEN et al., 2006).\n5.3.3\tBoundary conditions and Statistics indices\nFor the boundary conditions we used data from the third generation wave model WAVEWATCH III (or simply WW3) (TOLMAN, 1999) developed by NOAA/ NCEP and data obtained by the EN-VISAT satellite, through the ASAR sensor.\nThe WW3 wave model solves the spectral action energy conservation equation. The physical model includes generation, dissipation due to breaking waves in the bottom, refraction, advection and nonlinear interactions. Our implementation includes the globe with domain (78 \u00b0S \u2014 78 \u00b0N) and spatial resolution of 1 \u00b0 x 1.25 \u00b0 in latitude and longitude respectively. Temporal resolution was 3 hours and wind fields, obtained from the Global Data Assimilation Scheme (GDAS), were input in the model in 3 hour intervals. This model outputs the wind speed and direction, as well as the integrated spectral parameters, such as significant wave height Hs, peak period Tp and the mean direction at the peak period Dp.\nData from WAVEWATCH III were nested in SWAN as boundary conditions. The wind components U and V, from the WAVEWATCH III for every 3 hours, were adjusted to the computational grid using a linear interpolation based on the Delaunay triangulation, and then these were smoothed on the model grid (GUIMAR\u00c3ES; FARINA; Toldo Jr., 2014). With regard to satellite data, the closest measure to the edge parallel to the coast were used. The initial conditions were defined based on a non-stationary JONSWAP spectrum distribution obtained through the wave parameters Hs, Tp and Dp and directional spreading.\nTo ascertain the quality of results from the two simulations, various statistical parameters as root mean square error (RMSE) Eq.(5.1), scattering index (SI) Eq.(5.2), bias Eq.(5.3), bias mean square slope (SS) Eq.(5.4) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) Eq.(5.5) were used\nand given by\nR=\nRMSE =\nSI =\n-^(M \u2014 S)2,\ni= i\nx a,&lt;m\u2014s)2\nS\nBias = M \u2014 S,\nSS =\nm=i (M)2 m=i (S)2\nrn=i(Mf\u2014M)(Si\u2014s) ve n=i(M\u2014M)2 \u2022\tn=i(Si\u2014S)2\n(5.1)\n(5.2)\n(5.3)\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n1\nwhere M refers the model results and S the satellite measurements with IM and S representing\ntheir mean values and n is the number of data points.\n5.4\tResults and discussion\nWe studied a total of six events in the period 2002 and 2009; three in the South region and three in the Northeast.

The mean peak period was approximately 8 s for WW3 boundary data and 9 s for satellite boundary data. In the three events studied, two lasted 12 days (E01 and E02) and another 9 days (E03), all of which occurred during the fall/winter in the Southern Hemisphere.\nTo compare the two simulations and also to analyse the behaviour of wave parameters as time series we considered two points within the computational domain at n different times; one located in shallow water (30 \u00b0 S, 50.05999 \u00b0 W with ==20 m depth), near the city of Tramandai, and other in deep water (30.8679 \u00b0 S, 48.9691 \u00b0 W, with >2000 m depth). The results are shown in table 5.3. The results show correlation between the two simulations for each of the events. Hs, Tp and Dp correspond to of all grid points, Hsw, TPsw and DPw are the variables in the shallow points and Hsdw, TPdw and DPw denote the points in deep water. R is the Pearson correlation coefficient, and R2 the coefficient of determination. The RMSE values (RMSE), scattering index (SI), mean square slope (SS) and (BIas) are also presented.\nTable 5.3: Statistical parameters for the three events in the southern region for n different times at two locations; shallow water (sw) and deep water (dw).

Exceptions to this are observed for DPdw and TPdw for the event E01, where the coefficients of Pearson are well below the ones found for other variables and events.\nIn all events, larger values of the scattering index are observed for the peak period. Regarding the SS and bias results, we see that the peak period is underestimated by the WW3 boundary data simulation in all events, both in shallow and deep water. This corroborate with Po\u00e7as et al. (2010) conclusions in which WW3 model data tend to be underestimated compared to ASAR wave data. We also observe that the bias in the significant wave height are very small in all cases and much less than those shown for the peak direction, although in the former case\nthere is not a consistent tendency detected.\nWe show in figures 5.2-5.4 the significant wave height and peak period in selected times where the bias reached its larger absolute values during each event. It can bee seen that Hs is generally overestimated by the WW3 boundary data simulation in all three cases with the exception with a small region in the southwest of the domain where a negative bias occurred. Regarding the peak period we have three remarks. First, only in the event E02 (figure 5.3) the bias is prominently negative, meaning larger Tp with the satellite boundary data. Second, in the event E01 (figure 5.2), the region where the bias is negative corresponds very closely to the Hs negative bias. This confirms an observation, supported by simulations of other times of the events, that negative bias in Hs is accompanied by negative bias in Tp. This suggests that the wave height is typically underestimated by the model when it does not detect longer waves. Finally, a narrow region delimited by the south of Patos lagoon and extending southwards, where the bias is noticeable larger and positive, is seen in figures 5.2 and 5.3. This can be identified roughly as the boundary of the area most affected by high waves generated by extra-tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic.\n5.4.2\tNortheast region\nThe data in table 5.2 show that the events studied in the Northeast region are not as energetic as the ones we considered in the South region. Nevertheless, these events presented longer waves and thus, they fit for a comparison using ASAR data. The mean significant wave height was slightly underestimated by the simulation with WW3 data, while the maximum significant wave height was overestimated by it.\nThe first event (E01N) lasted 7 days, the second (E02N), 16 days and the third (E03N) 12 days. All these took place during spring or summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\nIn this region we also selected two points within the computational domain for a local analysis. As the previous case, these points are located in shallow water (3.6184200 S, 380 W with ==20 m depth), near the city of Fortaleza, and in deepwater (2.12130 S, 36.71210 Wwith >2000 m depth).\nAs shown in table 5.4, there is a overall significant correlation, with exceptions, between the two simulations in all wave parameters. The correlation is lowest for Tp, mainly in the E03N event where the bias is negative. This event also had the lowest correlation values for Hs.\nAs observed in the southern region, the largest discrepancy between the simulated values occurs for Tp at all events, both for shallow and deep water environments. We notice also that on average the simulation with WW3 boundary data underestimated Hs and Tp in all events.\n(c) Bias\n(f) Bias\nFigure 5.2: Map wave field for Hs and Tp during event E01, where (a)(d) WW3, (b)(e) Satellite and (c)(f) Bias.\nIn figures 5.5-5.7, the wave field in terms of Hs and Tp are represented for selected times when the absolute value of bias was largest in each of the events.

These events were selected based on the period range captured by the satellite ENVISAT to propitiate a more realistic comparison. WW3 and satellite data were used as boundary conditions in the simulations with SWAN. The two simulations were compared in time and space and in selected points located in shallow and deep water for each event.\nThe results show that there was an overall correlation shown by the Pearson coefficient between the two simulations studied, particularly in the South region. As a general conclusion, we point out that the Tp has the lowest values for the coefficient of Pearson and also negative bias, meaning that the simulation with WW3 boundary data underestimated this variable.\nWe noticed also that Hs presented a very small bias. However the significant wave height was consistently higher in the simulation with the WW3 data in the critical times where the events presented largest absolute bias. Moreover, in the Northeast region, where the swell was more dominant, we found that the maximum significant wave height was higher for the simulations with WW3 data.\nAcknowledgements\nThe first author acknowledges financial support by CAPES, Brazil, through the Project Edital\nCapes Ci\u00eancias do Mar 09/2009.

Washington, DC, 1999. 110 p.\n6\tConclus\u00e3o\nEste trabalho usou o modelo WAVEWATCH III (WW3) como ferramenta para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de aspectos importantes em uma determinada regi\u00e3o do Atl\u00e2ntico Sul que \u00e9 vulner\u00e1vel ao impacto de eventos extremos entre 2001 a 2009. O modelo WW3 tamb\u00e9m foi utilizado para uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o global com dados do sat\u00e9lite ENVISAT da Ag\u00eancia Espacial Europeia (ESA) atrav\u00e9s do sensor ASAR para o ano de 2007. Os dados do modelo e do sat\u00e9lite tamb\u00e9m foram utilizados como entrada para o modelo SWAN, que foi utilizado em eventos em que as ondas de swell eram predominantes. Utilizando os dados das componentes U e V do vento provenientes do modelo WW3 foram calculadas as trajet\u00f3rias dos ciclones extratropicais entre 2001 a 2009. Estas foram classificadas em tr\u00eas padr\u00f5es, o Padr\u00e3o III \u00e9 o mais comum (41,4%), com uma maior incid\u00eancia de eventos que aparecem em maio. A influ\u00eancia destes padr\u00f5es foi analisada para tr\u00eas cidades da regi\u00e3o Sul, Garopaba (SC), Tramanda\u00ed (RS) e Rio Grande (RS). Verificou-se que os ventos dominantes dos padr\u00f5es I, II e III foram, respectivamente, NE, SW e SW em todos os tr\u00eas locais. Os maiores valores de altura m\u00e9dia e altura m\u00e1xima de onda est\u00e3o associados aos padr\u00f5es II e III, que s\u00e3o os mais erosivos e os que geram as maiores eleva\u00e7\u00f5es no n\u00edvel do mar, respectivamente. Os maiores valores de altura de onda est\u00e3o associados com os padr\u00f5es II e III (87,5%), especialmente o \u00faltimo. Foram encontrados um total de 28 eventos, onde foi observada uma boa correla\u00e7\u00e3o global entre os dados de altura de onda significativa e velocidade do vento. O evento de n\u00famero 3 apresentou a ocorr\u00eancia simult\u00e2nea de dois ciclones causando danos \u00e0 linha de costa em v\u00e1rias cidades. Os valores de altura de onda e intensidade do vento deste evento se mostraram superiores aos demais. Durante este evento Garopaba apresentou valores de altura e intensidade do vento mais elevados. O evento ocorrido em Maio de 2001 produziu altura significativa m\u00e1xima da onda que superou em cerca de 10% todos os outros eventos (com exce\u00e7\u00e3o do evento 28) em todos os 11 anos analisados.\nDados do sat\u00e9lite ENVISAT, obtidos por um sensor ASAR, foram comparados com os dados do modelo WW3 para o ano de 2007. Utilizando par\u00e2metros estat\u00edsticos como vi\u00e9s e \u00edndice de espalhamento a altura de swell foi analisada. Neste trabalho, foi introduzido um algoritmo para representar dados irregulares de onda do sat\u00e9lite em uma malha uniforme. Este procedimento tamb\u00e9m permite a compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados de sat\u00e9lite e modelo no mesmo ponto no espa\u00e7o e no tempo. Este algoritmo \u00e9 uma grande contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para a tese em geral. As maiores\nalturas foram observadas em altas latitudes (60 \u00b0 N e 60 \u00b0 S) para ambos os hemisf\u00e9rios. O HS apresentou os maiores valores de altura de swell, principalmente pelo fato do per\u00edodo analisado compreender outono e inverno neste hemisf\u00e9rio. Analisando os valores de vi\u00e9s constatou-se que as maiores varia\u00e7\u00f5es ocorrem em altas latitudes, predominando valores negativos. Sendo assim, na altura de swell ocorreu uma maior subestima\u00e7\u00e3o dos valores do modelo em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos valores do sat\u00e9lite. Al\u00e9m disso, verificou-se que, nos tr\u00f3picos, \u00e1reas menos intensas, mas mais extensas, tamb\u00e9m apresentam vi\u00e9s negativo e, portanto, subestimam as alturas do swell.\nDados do modelo WW3 e do sat\u00e9lite foram utilizados como condi\u00e7\u00e3o inicial para o modelo SWAN, que foi utilizado em eventos em que as ondas de swell eram predominantes. Estes eventos foram selecionados com base na faixa em que o sat\u00e9lite (ENVISAT) mede o per\u00edodo da onda para uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o mais realista poss\u00edvel. No total foram selecionados 6 eventos, sendo 3 localizados na regi\u00e3o sul e outros 3 na regi\u00e3o nordeste entre 2002 e 2009. Para cada evento as duas simula\u00e7\u00f5es foram comparadas com base no tempo e espa\u00e7o e tamb\u00e9m para pontos espec\u00edficos localizados em \u00e1guas rasas e profundas. Os resultados mostram que houve uma excelente correla\u00e7\u00e3o, evidenciada pelo coeficiente de Pearson, entre as duas simula\u00e7\u00f5es nas duas regi\u00f5es estudadas, principalmente na an\u00e1lise espacial e temporal. Foi constatado que o Tp, para a simula\u00e7\u00e3o com dados do WW3, \u00e9 subestimado em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 simula\u00e7\u00e3o com dados do sat\u00e9lite em todos os eventos. Os resultados obtidos mostram que houve uma grande coer\u00eancia entre as duas simula\u00e7\u00f5es. Apesar de o Tp apresentar disparidade maior entre as duas simula\u00e7\u00f5es, a tend\u00eancia mostrou-se coerente tanto nos dados simulados com o WW3 como do sat\u00e9lite.\nEste trabalho utilizou dados provenientes de sat\u00e9lite e de modelos num\u00e9ricos de onda, onde foi comparado diversos par\u00e2metros em escala global e regional (sul e nordeste do Brasil). Tamb\u00e9m foi comparado altura e velocidade de vento em situa\u00e7\u00f5es de eventos extremos para a regi\u00e3o sul do pa\u00eds. Os resultados mostram que ocorreu uma boa correspond\u00eancia entre os dados do sat\u00e9lite e modelo, no entanto foi observado que os dados provenientes do sat\u00e9lite tendem a superestimar os dados de modelo. Uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o mais detalhada e com maior quantidade de dados poderia validar isto e fica como um passo a ser feito em trabalhos futuros.\n7\nAnexos\nUNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL\nUNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO\nUFRGS INSTITUTO DE GEOCI\u00caNCIAS\nUNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL\nPesquisas em Geoci\u00eancias\nPorto Alegre, 14 de novembro de 2017.\nAo Heitor Perotto e colaboradores\nVenho comunicar o recebimento do manuscrito listado, submetido para publica\u00e7\u00e3o em Pesquisas em Geoci\u00eancias, \u00f3rg\u00e3o de divulga\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica editado pelo Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.\nContudo, para dar prosseguimentos \u00e0s atividades editoriais, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio realizar ajustes, necessitando, portanto, de nova submiss\u00e3o.\nOs principais problemas encontrados dizem respeito \u00e0 formata\u00e7\u00e3o, subdivis\u00e3o do texto, incluindo a necessidade de padronizar todas as refer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas de acordo com as normas da revista, conforme poder\u00e3o observar no arquivo em anexo, que deve ser utilizado para confec\u00e7\u00e3o de um novo arquivo e uma nova submiss\u00e3o.\nAgrade\u00e7o a sele\u00e7\u00e3o de Pesquisas em Geoci\u00eancias para a publica\u00e7\u00e3o de sua contribui\u00e7\u00e3o.\nObserva\u00e7\u00f5es:\na)\tSalvar a nova vers\u00e3o como o nome Man 713 Perotto et al.\nb)\tNa mensagem eletr\u00f4nica, no campo \u201cassunto\u201d, inserir: Man 713 Perotto et al.\nManuscrito 713: Tracking extratropical cyclones which cause extreme ocean wave events in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean.\nAutores: Heitor Perotto, Leandro Farina &amp; El\u00edrio Ernestino Toldo Junior.\nAtenciosamente,\nProf. Dr. Paulo Alves de Souza Editor Chefe\nPesquisas em Geoci\u00eancias\nInstituto de Geoci\u00eancias - Departamento de Paleontologia e Estratigraf\u00eda Av.
