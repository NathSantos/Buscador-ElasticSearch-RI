The river is under Federal \n\njurisdiction because is the natural border between the States of Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo, \n\nwith a length of 929 km. The river is known for its \u201cgood water quality\u201d and for \n\npresenting eleven hydropower plants, which have been constructed along the main \n\ncourse of the river. \n\nIn 2011, a systematic Physical, Chemical and Biotic (Phytoplankton and \n\nThermotolerant coliforms)\n1\n Monitoring Program started in eight cascade reservoirs of \n\nthe Paranapanema River reservoir cascade system (Jurumirim, Chavantes, Salto \n\nGrande, Canoas II, Canoas I, Capivara, Taquaru\u00e7u and Rosana). This initiative resulted \n\nfrom a partnership between the company in charge of the hydropower generation and \n\nresearchers of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), Campus of Botucatu. At that \n\ntime, I participated in this program as a research trainee supported by a scholarship \n\nfrom FUNDIBIO (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o do Instituto de Bioci\u00eancias \u2013 UNESP Botucatu). \n\nAiming to deep explore the monitoring results and use the academic knowledge \n\non the complexity of these ecosystems in order to improve the technical protocols of \n\nthe Monitoring Program, in 2013 we proposed the development of this PhD Thesis \n\nentitled: \n\n\"Evaluation to the use of water quality indexes and bioindicators - zooplankton \n\nand phytoplankton, in a monitoring program of Paranapanema River Reservoirs \n\nCascata (SP / PR - Brazil)\" (\u201cAvalia\u00e7\u00e3o do uso de \u00edndices de qualidade de \u00e1gua e \n\n                                                           \n1\n Zooplankton was additionally sampled - it was not part of the monitoring protocols. \n\n\n\nbioindicadores \u2013 zoopl\u00e2ncton e fitopl\u00e2ncton, em um programa de monitoramento \n\ndos Reservat\u00f3rios em Cascata no rio Paranapanema (SP/PR \u2013 Brasil)\u201d (in Portuguese). \n\nThe Thesis was partitioned into four distinct, but complementary, Chapters. Since \n\nthe themes are reasonably connected, some repetitions are inevitable. \n\nThe title of Chapter 1 is \u201cIdentifying limnological patterns in a large subtropical \n\nreservoir cascade \u2013 Paranapanema River, Brazil\u201d. The objective is to discriminate the \n\nmain limnological tendencies and recurrent patters along the Paranapanema River \n\ncascade. Analyses based on the reservoirs morphometric characteristics, operation \n\ntype, water retention type, physical, chemical and biological variables and trophic \n\nstatus. In this chapter were considered eight reservoirs, Jurumirim (JR), Chavantes \n\n(CH), Salto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas I (CI), Capivara (CP), Taquaru\u00e7u (TQ) e \n\nRosana (RS), arranged in a cascade system with a total of 37 sampling sites and two \n\nsampling seasons (wet and dry). We analyze water transparency, depth, temperature, \n\npH, condutivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total solids, suspended \n\nsolids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and thermotolerant coliforms as \n\nlimnol\u00f3gicas variables and also some ecologically important morphometric \n\ncharacteristics. \n\nThe Chapter 2 is entitled \u201cApplication of multiple-uses indices to assess water \n\nquality emphasizing the zooplankton community and focus on biomonitoring and \n\nmanagement purposes\u201d. Here we indeed to apply and compare the results of different \n\ntypes of water quality indices for multipurpose uses, such as water supply, trophy \n\nlevels evaluation and protection of aquatic communities. The selected indexes were \n\nWater Quality Index (WQI), Trophic State Index (Carlson, 1977 and some derived \n\nmodified models), Phytoplankton Community Index (FCI), Zooplankton Community \n\nIndex (ZCI) and the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) - a new tool that has been \n\nrecently developed. The objective is to generated new insights on this theme in order \n\nto improve the present water quality monitoring program at a regional scale - a \n\nrelatively large watershed from Southeast Brazil. \n\nThe Chapter 3 is entitled \u201cZooplankton community composition and structure \n\nas potential indicators of water quality and trophic state conditions in the \n\nParanapanema River reservoir cascade\u201d. The main goal of this study is to explore \n\ninformation on the structure of the zooplankton sampled in the Paranapanema River \n\n\n\nreservoir cascade (eight reservoirs), focusing on the potential of this community to \n\nevaluate changes in water quality and trophic level - biomonitoring purposes. \n\nInformation on the structure and functioning of planktonic communities in reservoir \n\necosystems provide opportunities to investigate patterns of responses to cyclical \n\nvariations and episodic disturbances and can be useful to evaluate the resilience in this \n\nkind of system to limnological changes in relatively short periods.  \n\nFinally, the Chapter 4 is entitled \u201cA new tool to assess ecosystem health in \n\nlarge subtropical reservoirs: development and validation of a Planktonic Index of \n\nBiotic Integrity (P-IBI)\u201d. We developed and validated a Planktonic Index of Biotic \n\nIntegrity (P-IBI) following Kane et al. (2009) with the purpose of effectively assess the \n\necosystem health of subtropical reservoirs. The study is based on a reservoir cascade \n\nsystem located in Southern Brazil and includes metrics of the plankton community \u2013 \n\nphyto and zooplankton. In contrast to traditional water quality approaches, the P-IBI is \n\nan aggregative indicator that can not only capture aquatic trophic status but also \n\nidentify variations in the aquatic ecosystems associated to the biota. The development \n\nand application of a viable Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) for subtropical \n\nreservoirs can be useful for management purposes \u2013 stakeholder\u2019s decision processes, \n\nimprovement of monitoring protocols, and expansion of scientific knowledge. \n\nWe hope this thesis can bring new insights to the research line on Ecology of \n\nReservoirs and that some ideas and obtained results may support better management \n\nresolutions too. \n\n\n\nSummary \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Identifying limnological patterns in a large \n\nsubtropical reservoir cascade \u2013 Paranapanema River, Brazil \n\n1 \n\n  \n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Application of multiple-uses indices to assess \n\nwater quality emphasizing the zooplankton community and focus on \n\nbiomonitoring and management purposes \n\n70 \n\n  \n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Zooplankton community composition and \n\nstructure as potential indicators of water quality and trophic state \n\nconditions in the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade  \n\n108 \n\n  \n\nChapter 4 \u2013 A new tool to assess ecosystem health in large \n\nsubtropical reservoirs: development and validation of a Planktonic \n\nIndex of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) \n\n138 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1 - Identifying limnological patterns in a large \n\nsubtropical reservoir cascade \u2013 Paranapanema River, Brazil \n\n\n\n1 \n \n\nIdentifying limnological patterns in a large subtropical reservoir cascade \u2013 \n\nParanapanema River, Brazil \n\n \n\nJuliana Pomari\na\n* and Marcos G.

The Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of \n\nthe high Paran\u00e1 River (La Plata basin) and is the natural border between the States of \n\nParan\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo, Southern Brazil.

A total of \n\n37 sites were sampled in two seasons (dry and wet). We analyzed the following \n\nlimnological and water quality variables: water transparency, depth, temperature, pH, \n\nconductivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total solids, suspended \n\nsolids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and thermotolerant coliforms. \n\nAdditionally, it was calculated the trophic state index for tropical/subtropical \n\nreservoirs, the water retention time and some important morphometric characteristics \n\nof each reservoir. Data analyzes focused on spatial (longitudinal and vertical \n\ndimensions) and seasonal (late summer-wet and late spring-dry periods) variation. The \n\nreservoir operational design (storage or run-of-river) is a major factor influencing on \n\nlimnological structure and functioning. It was concluded that the influence of the land \n\nuse intensification in the Paranapanema River middle stretches is also determinant and \n\ncomparable to the influence of the river damming.  \n\n \n\nmailto:jupomari@ibb.unesp.br\n\n\n2 \n \n\nResumo \n\nO presente estudo tem como objetivo identificar padr\u00f5es limnol\u00f3gicos na cascata de \n\nreservat\u00f3rios do rio Paranapanema como um sistema, baseado nas caracter\u00edsticas \n\nmorfom\u00e9tricas, tipo de opera\u00e7\u00e3o, tempo de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, vari\u00e1veis f\u00edsicas, \n\nqu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas, al\u00e9m do estado tr\u00f3fico, para fins de manejo.

For the South \n\nAmerican continent, there is an estimative of about 1,000 installed reservoirs \n\n(Agostinho et al., 2007). \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nMost large reservoirs in the country are primarily projected for production of \n\nelectricity. Brazil's water potential is one of the largest in the world, where \n\nhydropower plants have produced about 90% of the energy consumed in recent years \n\n(ca. 70,000MW). Presently there are at least 190 large hydropower plants (individual \n\nproduction higher than 30 MW) and 420 small ones (individual production lower than \n\n30 MW) (www.aneeel.gov.br). Additionally, a number of 1,000 different sites have \n\nbeen inventoried for new projects (potential 107,000 MW) (Kelman et al., 2006). \n\nFor the first decades of this new century, it is expected the construction of the \n\n3,700 dams worldwide, what could increase the global hydropower production by 73 \n\n%. This would correspond to intensification in the exploitation of the technically \n\nfeasible hydropower potential from 22 % to 39% (International Commission on Large \n\nDams, 2011). However, the role of hydropower in total global electricity production \n\nwill rise only slightly from 16 % in 2011 to 18 % until 2040 because of the concurrent \n\nincrease in global energy demand (Zarfl et al., 2015). \n\nHydroelectric dams are an integrated and complex generation system that \n\nprovide a relatively clean and renewable energy type. However, they can cause major \n\nsocio-environmental changes and interfere with the ecological structure and \n\nfunctioning of river basins (Tundisi et al., 1993; Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 2003; \n\nNogueira et al., 2006; Agostinho et al., 2007). \n\nThe construction of dams in the rivers transforms lotic stretches into lentic or \n\nsemi-lentic systems, promoting significant attenuations in current velocity and \n\nincrease in depth. The reservoirs, especially those of large size, are generally systems \n\nof great spatial and temporal complexity (Thornton, 1990; Straskraba et al., 1993; \n\nTundisi et al., 1993; Nogueira et al., 1999). \n\nIn terms of the operational design and engineering concept, reservoirs can be \n\nclassified as accumulation (storage) or run-of-river systems (Kelman et al., 1999). The \n\naccumulation systems are larger in size and volume, with high water retention time. \n\nThe distinctiveness between accumulation and run-of-river systems, in terms of \n\nphysical dimensions and functioning, affects the physical and chemical limnology of \n\nthese environments as well as the aquatic communities organization (Nogueira et al., \n\n2008; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2010; Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 2003; \n\nNogueira et al. 2012; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2013). \n\nhttp://www.aneeel.gov.br/\n\n\n4 \n \n\nThe accumulated limnological knowledge on reservoirs limnology promoted a \n\ngrowing understanding of these environments as an exclusive class of lakes (e.g. \n\nTundisi, 1988, Thornton, 1990; Stra\u0161kraba, et al., 1993; Henry, 1999, Tundisi and \n\nStra\u0161kraba, 1999). Despite of the structural and functional similarity between lakes and \n\nlarge reservoirs some particularities have been pointed out. For instance, Lind et aI. \n\n(1993) discussed the differences between lakes and reservoirs related to the \n\napplication of trophic state indexes. According to the authors, one of the main factor \n\nthat affect the application of these indices is the conspicuous spatial heterogeneity \n\nthat occurs in reservoirs. \n\nClassical studies on reservoirs, including Thornton (1990) and Wetzel (2001), \n\ndistinguish three areas in a reservoir: the region with strong influence of the incoming \n\nriver - lotic region; an intermediate - transition region and finally a region considered \n\nsimilar to a lake, located near the dam. However, it is now known that in large tropical \n\nreservoirs, this zonation is multidimensional, greatly influenced by the input of \n\nsecondary tributaries and also by the differential residence time of each reservoir arm \n\n(Nogueira et al., 1999, Nogueira, 2000; 2001; Pinto-Coelho et al., 2006). These \n\ndistinctive areas in reservoir ecosystem may also change seasonally, in a complex \n\ndynamics (Thornton et al., 1990; Henry and Maricatto, 1996; Nogueira et al., 1999; \n\nPagioro and Thomaz, 2002). \n\nThe large-scale variability of reservoirs along the main axis is determined by \n\nlongitudinal gradients of flow velocity, depth, width, particle sedimentation, \n\ntransparency and light penetration, and thermal stratification (Armengol et al. 1999; \n\nHenry and Maricatto, 1996; Paggioro and Thomaz, 2002). In comparison with lakes, \n\nreservoirs exhibit high watersheds area/water body area, shorter but varying \n\nretentions times, a rapid ageing process related to watershed uses, high capability to \n\nretain organic and inorganic matter (Straskraba, 1998; Straskraba and Tundisi, 1999). \n\nThe limnological conditions and the water quality of the rivers, lakes and \n\nreservoirs are greatly influenced by the drainage network, due to the biogeophysical \n\ncharacteristics of the basin, land uses and the state of conservation of the ecosystems. \n\nThus, differences in the concentration of total dissolved solids or particulates in water, \n\nfor example, reflect variations of geological nature, soil use and occupation, and \n\nprecipitation/evaporation rate. The characteristics of riparian vegetation along \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nwatercourses, in turn, may be responsible for differences in water temperature and in \n\nthe quantity and size distribution of the organic particles transported (Rice et al., 2001; \n\nJorcin and Nogueira, 2005). \n\nHowever, there are still many gaps in the understanding of these ecosystems. In \n\ncase of cascaded reservoirs, efforts have been undertaken to determine how their \n\noperation affects the ecological structure and organization of rivers or how cumulative \n\neffects spread throughout the system (Barbosa et al., 1999; Matsumura-Tundisi and \n\nTundisi, 2003; Nogueira et al., 2006; 2008; Jorcin and Nogueira, 2008; Naliato et al., \n\n2009; Nogueira et al., 2012; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2013). In Brazil, new \n\ncascades of reservoirs have been built or planned, including rivers under international \n\njurisdiction, such as Paran\u00e1 and Uruguay. \n\nAn integrated approach, including measurements and experimentation, is \n\nrequired for the understanding of the problems and working mechanisms of reservoir \n\necosystems, giving their inherent complexity, with many components and subsystems \n\nthat interact intensively in space and time (Tundisi, 2008). \n\nThe Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of the Paran\u00e1 River (La \n\nPlata basin), located between the coordinates 22\u00b0 - 26\u00b0 S and 47\u00b0 - 54\u00b0 W, on the \n\ntropical/subtropical boundary (Southeast/South Brazil). The river, with a length of 929 \n\nkm, is under Federal jurisdiction, because it is the natural border between the states of \n\nParan\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo. According to the CEEIPEMA (Executive Committee for \n\nIntegrated Studies of the Paranapanema River Basin) in 1980 the Paranapanema River \n\nwas classified as Class 1 (CONAMA Resolution 357/2005) from the headwaters to the \n\nconfluence of the Turvo River and as Class 2 from the confluence of the Turvo River to \n\nits mouth on the Paran\u00e1 River. These classifications intended \"to preserve the natural \n\nbalance of aquatic communities\". \n\nAiming to provide technical-scientific information on behalf of management \n\npurposes, the present study intended to identify limnological tendencies or patterns of \n\nvariation in the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade. We considered the \n\nmorphometric characteristics, operation type, water retention time, physical, chemical \n\nand biological variables and the trophic status. We hypothesized that: 1) the \n\nParanapanema River reservoir cascaded is highly influenced by the intensification of \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nthe agriculture land use towards the middle basin; 2) The reservoir operation is \n\ndeterminant in establishing reservoirs limnological patterns. \n\nStudy area \n\nThe Paranapanema River is the natural border between the states of Paran\u00e1 \n\nand S\u00e3o Paulo, with a length of 929 km. Since the 1950\u2019s, eleven hydropower plants \n\nwere constructed in the main course of the river. Ongoing studies have being carried \n\nout in eight of the reservoirs by researchers of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University, Campus \n\nof Botucatu, as part of a Limnological and Water Quality monitoring program of the \n\nParanapanema River reservoir cascade. Three of the reservoirs, Jurumirim, Chavantes \n\nand Capivara are storage systems (i.e. with high water retention times), whereas the \n\nothers, Salto Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, Taquaru\u00e7u and Rosana are run-of-the-river \n\nsystems. \n\nThe selected reservoirs for study purposes are Jurumirim (JR), Chavantes (CH), \n\nSalto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas I (CI), Capivara (CP), Taquaru\u00e7u (TQ) and \n\nRosana (RS), arranged in a cascade (upstream ? downstream) system. Information \n\nwere obtained at 37 sampling sites (Fig. 1), whose distribution intended to cover the \n\nlongitudinal gradient between the lotic (Paranapanema River entrance) and lentic \n\n(dam) areas of each reservoir, as well as the entrance of important secondary \n\ntributaries. At least three up to six sites in each reservoir were selected.

For this last variable 100 mL of sample was collected with sterilized \n\ngloves to avoid contamination and formerly wrapped in a sterile plastic envelope. \n\nSamples for total nitrogen and total phosphorus were previously digested \n\n(Valderrama, 1981) and then determined spectrophotometrically (Strickland and \n\nParsons, 1960). Turbidity was measured in a turbidimeter Tecnopon MS and total \n\nsolids were analyzed according to the amount of remaining residues in a beaker after \n\ntotal evaporation of a sample and subsequent oven drying at a set temperature (100 \u00b0 \n\nC) (APHA, 2005). \n\nThe determination of suspended solids followed the gravimetric method \n\naccording to the principle described in Cole (1979). Millipore AP40 membranes and \n\nvacuum filtration pump were used for the retention of particulate material in \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nsuspension in a known volume of water (500 to 1000 ml). The filters were pre-dried \n\n(450 \u00b0C for 1h) and weighed on the Denver Instrument analytical balance (0.00001g \n\nprecision). After filtration in the field, the filters were again dried and weighed to \n\nobtain the total suspended material (50 \u00b0C / 24h). Subsequently, the same filters were \n\ntaken to an oven type Mufla (Fanen brand model 413) at 450 \u00b0C for 1 hour to \n\ndiscriminate the organic and inorganic fractions. \n\nThe biochemical oxygen demand was determined by the Incubation Method \n\n(20 \u00b0C, 5 days) (APHA, 1998) and thermo tolerant coliforms quantitative determination \n\nwas performed according to the NMP technique, recommended by APHA (2005). \n\nTotal chlorophyll a concentration was determined after vacuum filtration \n\n(Millipore AP40 membranes) of 0.5 to 1 L of water from each sampling depth, \n\ndepending on the concentration of particulate material on the water sample. For \n\npigments extraction, cold acetone (90%) and manual maceration were used (Talling \n\nand Driver, 1963; Golterman et al., 1978). \n\nThe shore line development index was calculated according methodology \n\nproposed by H\u00e4kanson (2005) and using data collected from Duke Energy International \n\nParanapanema Generation (ABC da Energia). The theoretical residence time (days) was \n\ndefined as the ratio of reservoir volume and the flow calculated using the formula: TRT \n\n= V / (Q x 86,400), where V = reservoir volume (m\u00b3); Q = mean flow (m\u00b3 s\n-1\n\n) and 86,400 \n\n= number of seconds contained in a day. Input data are available at the government \n\nagency website (http://sar.ana.gov.br). \n\nThe trophic state index was determined in accordance with Cunha et al. (2013) \n\nfor tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr), which include six categories: (U) \n\nUltraoligotrophic (?51.1), (O) Oligotrophic (51.2 -53.1), (M) Mesotrophic (53.2-55.7), \n\n(E) Eutrophic (55.8-58.1), (S) Supereutrophic (58.2-59) and (H) Hypereutrophic (? 59.1), \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe studied parameters were compared with the references standards \n\nestablished by CONAMA Resolution 357/2005 (conditions of water quality categories \n\nfor Brazilian aquatic systems) for Class 1 waters \u2013 the better condition in which the \n\nParanapanema River is framed of.

In the wet \n\nseason different conditions were found along the reservoir. In the central region of the \n\nreservoir \u2013 station JR3, the temperature profile was practically isothermal while at JR1 \n\nand JR4 sites decreasing gradients were observed. Slightly stratification occurred at \n\ndam (JRDam) and upstream (JRUp) areas and more structured stratification occurred \n\nat JR2. Higher values of temperature were observed at the surface, varying between \n\n25 and 26.5 \no\nC, and the lower at the bottom, between 23 and 24 \n\no\nC. The amplitude of \n\nvariation between surface and bottom was higher at stations JR2 and JRUp, \n\napproximately 3 \no\nC. \n\nThe dry season was characterized by superficial stratifications \u2013 at JR1, JRUp \n\nand JR2, and isothermal condition at JRDam and JR4. At JR4 there was a decrease in \n\nthe temperature near to the bottom, bellow 21 m, and a small surface decrease was \n\nobserved at JRDam. \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Temperature profiles at the sampling sites of the Jurumirim reservoir in the \n2011 wet and dry seasons. \n \n\n The concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the water column were high in both \n\nperiods (Fig. 4). Profiles averages ranged from 8.6 mg l\n-1\n\n at JRDam to 9.3 mg l\n-1\n\n in JR2, \n\nin the wet season, and were higher in the dry period, between 10.28 mg l\n-1\n\n at JR4 and \n\n11.45 mg l\n-1\n\n at JRUp. In summer it was observed a considerable diminution of oxygen \n\nin the deepest layer of the water column at the dam zone (<5mg l\n-1\n\n). At others sampled \n\nsites, moderate decreases, around 2 mg l\n-1\n\n, occurred with increasing depth (JR4 and \n\nJR2) or values remained practically homogeneous (JR3, JR1 and JRUp). During the dry \n\nperiod, there was a small oxygen increase at the surface region of stations JR1, JRUp \n\nand JR2 and a bottom decrease at station JR4. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Dissolved oxygen profiles at the Jurumirim reservoir sampling sites in the \n2011 wet and dry seasons. \n \n\nThe values of conductivity, pH, turbidity, total and suspended solids, \n\nbiochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, thermo tolerant \n\ncoliforms and chlorophyll a for Jurumirim reservoir are shown in Figure 5. \n\nThe conductivity ranged from 44 ?S cm\n-1\n\n (JRUp) to 60 ?S cm\n-1\n\n(JR2) in the wet \n\nseason and between 50.38 ?S cm\n-1\n\n(JRUp) and 57.26 ?S cm\n-1\n\n(JR2) in the dry season. \n\nFor pH neutral or slightly alkaline values were measured in the wet season, \n\nranging from 7 (JR1) to 8 (JRDam), while in the dry season acid values predominated, \n\nbetween 4.64 (JR4) and 6.49 (JRUp). \n\nThe highest turbidity was observed during the wet season at JRUp, 42.98 NTU. \n\nFor the other sites, the values varied between 1.73 NTU, JRDam, and 25.69 NTU, JR1. \n\nIn the dry season it ranged between 3.85 NTU, JR1, and 36.28 NTU, JR2. \n\nIn the wet season lower values of total solids occurred at JR1, 53.3 mg l\n-1\n\n, and \n\nJRDam, 68.3 mg l\n-1\n\n, and higher at JR3, 89.6 mg l\n-1\n\n, and JR2, 97 mg l\n-1\n\n.

The values \n\nmeasured in the dry season ranged from 5.39 NTU (CH3) to 21.62 NTU (CH1). \n\nThe values of total solids determined in the wet season varied from 11.3 mg l\n-1\n\n, \n\nCH4, to 56.3 mg l\n-1\n\n, CH2. Higher values occurred during the dry season, between 61.3 \n\nmg l\n-1\n\n, CH2, and 72.7 mg l\n-1\n\n, CHDam. \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nHigher suspended solids values were found at stations CH1, Itarar\u00e9 axis \n\nupstream site, and CHDam.

In dry season the highest \n\nconcentration was found at CHDam 15.77 mg l\n-1\n\n and lower concentrations (<2) were \n\nobserved at CH2 and CH3. The inorganic matter fraction exceeds the organic fraction in \n\nall the Itarar\u00e9 axis sampled sites (CH1, CH2 and CH3). At the Paranapanema axis \n\nsampled sites (CHUp, CH4 and CHDam), the organic fraction was higher than the \n\ninorganic fraction, except for CHDam during the wet season. \n\nTotal nitrogen concentration in the water showed the highest values in the CH3 \n\n(392.98 ?g l\n-1\n\n) and CH2 sites (406.03 ?g l\n-1\n\n), in the wet season and at CH1 (302.05 ?g l\n-1\n\n) \n\nin dry season. The lower values occurred at CH4, 301.88 ?g l\n-1 \n\n(wet) and 197.87 ?g l\n-1 \n\n(dry season). \n\nThe total phosphorus concentrations ranged from 12.81 (CH4) to 39.76 ?g l\n-1 \n\n(CHDam) in the wet season. The CHDam high value is probably due to the high \n\nconcentration found in the depth of 35 meters (86.67 ?g l\n-1\n\n), just below the formation \n\nof the thermocline, where an increase of turbidity was detected too. In the dry period, \n\nthe values were much lower ranging from 5.34 ?g l\n-1\n\n, CHDam and 9.05 ?g l\n-1\n\n, CH1. \n\nAmong the sampled sites, the lowest values of biochemical oxygen demand \n\nwere observed at station CHUp, with 0.5 mg l\n-1\n\n O2 (wet season) and CH3, 0.6 mg l\n-1\n\n O2 \n\n(dry season).

In March, The lowest value of water transparency was observed in CIDam, 1.4 \n\nm (wet season), and at CIUp, with 2 m (dry season), while the highest was observed at \n\nCI1, 2.3 m (wet) and 3.6 m (dry). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Reservoir level and flow variation throughout the year (monthly average) \nand water transparency at the Canoas I reservoir sampling sites in the 2011 wet and \ndry seasons. \n \n\nThe temperature profiles along the water column show isothermal conditions \n\nin both sampled periods (Fig. 19), with values around 25-26 \no\nC (wet) and 22-24 \n\no\nC (dry \n\nseason). At CIDam and C1, a higher average temperature was observed in relation to \n\nCIUp, probably due to a tendency of heat accumulation in the more lentic zone - less \n\nadvective transport, deeper and of greater volume.

The \n\ninorganic fraction exceeded the organic fraction, except for RSDam, in the wet season, \n\nand the inorganic fraction exceeded the organic fraction at RSUp and RS1 in the dry \n\nperiod. \n\nHomogeneous values of total nitrogen concentration among the sampled sites \n\noccurred in the same season. Mean values were higher in the wet season, \n\napproximately 700 ?g l\n-1\n\n, compared to dry season, 470 ?g l\n-1\n\n. \n\nThe total phosphorus concentrations in the water ranged from 20.27 ?g l\n-1\n\n \n\n(RSDam) to 25.30 ?g l\n-1\n\n (RS1) in the wet season and from 6.83 ?g l\n-1\n\n (RSDam) to 22.16 \n\n?g l\n-1\n\n (RS1) in the dry season. \n\nThe biochemical oxygen demand ranged from 0.8 mg l\n-1\n\n O2 (RSUp and RS1) to 1.3 \n\nmg l\n-1\n\n O2 (RSDam) in wet season and from 0.8 mg l\n-1\n\n O2 (RS1) and 1.9 mg l\n-1\n\n O2 (RSDam) \n\nin dry season. \n\nThe thermo tolerant coliforms values varied between&lt;3 NMP/100ml, (RSDam, \n\n(wet and RS2, dry season) and 21 MNP/100ml, (RS1, wet and RS2, wet and dry season). \n\nThe chlorophyll a concentrations varied between 1.03 ?g l\n-1\n\n, RS1, and 1.52 ?g l\n-1\n\n, \n\nRSDam, in wet season and in the dry season between 1.71 ?g l\n-1\n\n, RSUp, and 7.50 ?g l\n-1\n\n, \n\nRS1. \n\nThe trophic status showed varied water quality with Ultraoligotrophic to \n\nMesotrophic conditions in the reservoir of Rosana. Except for one turbidity value (RS1 - \n\n154.79 NTU, dry season) and two total phosphorus values (RSUp \u2013 25.22 ?g l\n-1\n\n and RS1 \n\n\u2013 25.30 ?g l\n-1\n\n, wet season) all parameter are in agreement with CONAMA Resolution \n\n357/2005 standard for Class 1 (Table 4). \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 33 - Values (Mean, + S.D.) of conductivity, pH, turbidity, total and suspended \nsolids, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, thermotolerant \ncoliforms and chlorophyll a at the Rosana reservoir sampling sites in the 2011 wet and \ndry seasons. \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nThe first two axes (PC1 and PC2) of the principal component analysis \n\ncorresponded to 48.3% of the ordering of the sampled sites in relation to the \n\nlimnological variables (Table 5; Fig. 34). \n\nIn the first axis (PC1) the transparency, turbidity, inorganic suspended solids, \n\norganic suspended solids and chlorophyll a were the variables with greater influence \n\non the ordering of the points. In axis two (PC2) the distribution was mainly influenced \n\nby temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus (Table 5; \n\nFig. 34). The analysis demonstrates the strong influence of seasonality in the cascade \n\nof Paranapanema reservoirs. \n\n \nTable 5 - Principal Component Scores for Paranapanema River reservoir cascade \nconsidering the first two Components. \n\nLimnological Variables    PC1 (30,7%)    PC2 (17,6%) \n\nTransparency -0.405 -0.020 \nDeph -0.125 0.052 \nTemperature 0.061 -0.545 \npH 0.022 -0.420 \nCondutivity 0.100 -0.184 \nTurbidity 0.403 0.095 \n\nDissolved Oxygen -0.048 0.251 \nBiochemical Oxygen Demand 0.143 0.124 \nTotal Solids 0.199 0.061 \nInorganic Suspended Solids 0.415 0.191 \nOrganic Suspended Solids 0.390 0.165 \nTotal Nitrogen 0.225 -0.372 \nTotal Phosphorus 0.284 -0.381 \nChlorophill a 0.343 0.184 \nThemo tolerant Coliforms 0.089 -0.130 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \nFigure 34 - Principal Component Analysis of Paranapanema River reservoir cascade \nconsidering the first two Components PC1 and PC2 and using the seasonality as the \nfactor or ordination. \n\nDiscussion \n\nJurumirim reservoir \n\nThe Jurumirim reservoir exhibit a spatial organization pattern typical of large \n\nreservoirs, where gradual changes (gradient) of physical, chemical and biological \n\nconditions occur along the main axis established between the upstream (lotic zone) \n\nand the dam (lentic zone). For example, it was observed a clear increasing tendency, \n\napproximately 5 times, of transparency towards the dam for both seasons, and the \n\nopposite for turbidity and suspended solids. The reservoir showed a stratification \n\ntendency in the wet-warmer period (late summer \u2013 March), which has a strong \n\ninfluence on the limnology of the system. Oxygen values, for example, were high along \n\nthe water column, except for the deep zone of the dam region during the wet season \n\n(<5mg l\n-1\n\n), certainly due to an extended period of summer stratification. The pH, as \n\nwell as the temperature, also presented a considerable seasonal variation, with more \n\nbasic values in the wet season and neutral or slightly acid in the dry season. Only at the \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nJR2 station, a slightly higher value of chlorophyll (around 3.0 ?g l\n-1\n\n) was recorded, as a \n\nfunction of the local hydrodynamics, since this is an arm with little circulation of the \n\nwater.  \n\nChavantes reservoir \n\nInitially, it is important to consider that the sampling design for Chavantes \n\nreservoir is based on the existence of two \"longitudinal axes\": one of them formed \n\nalong the Itarar\u00e9 River Valley (CH1, CH2 and CH3), with lateral insertion into the \n\nParanapanema River, and the other corresponding to the Paranapanema River \n\nchannel, properly (CHUp, CH4 and CHDam). The analysis of the limnological \n\ncharacteristics of Chavantes reservoir corroborates the occurrence of these two large \n\ndistinct compartments. In general, variables such as turbidity, suspended solids, total \n\nnitrogen and total phosphorus (in this case only for wet season) exhibited lower values \n\nin the Paranapanema axis, compared to the Itarar\u00e9 axis. \n\nIn both spatial axes a longitudinal pattern of increase of water transparency \n\ntowards the dam was also observed, with the highest values in the Paranapanema axis \n\n(CHUp, CH4 and CHDam). Unlike the upper areas of the reservoir, the transparency in \n\nthe lacustrine zone is less affected by the summer heavy rains. \n\nDue to its large size, and by the fact that it is operated as a storage system, \n\nthere is a large seasonal variation of the water level. The pH values observed in the \n\nChavantes reservoir showed a high seasonal variation, tending to a more acidic \n\ncondition in the dry season and more basic in wet season. However, the influence of \n\nimportant factors associated with the annual variation of precipitation (e.g. sediment \n\nsupply) is limited to upstream zones, mainly on the Itarar\u00e9 axis. \n\nWith the exception of the CHUp, the Chavantes reservoir had a well defined \n\nthermal stratification, mainly in the central channel and lacustrine zone near the dam. \n\nThe variation of dissolved oxygen corroborates the temperature patterns, in \n\ngeneral, decreasing with depth in the wet and dry season. Low oxygen values were \n\nmeasured in the deep zones of the lentic region. This shows that this compartment, \n\ndue to the high depth, has a limited vertical circulation. A good indicator of the \n\nreservoir water quality condition is the low chlorophyll a values (maximum around 2 \n\n?g l\n-1\n\n). \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nSalto Grande reservoir \n\nAlthough it is a relatively small reservoir, there is a wide spatial and temporal \n\nvariation of the limnological conditions and water quality in Salto Grande reservoir. \n\nThe study demonstrates the influence of seasonality and compartmentalization on the \n\nphysical, chemical and biological characteristics of water. The importance of the \n\ncontribution of the tributary rivers to the central body of the reservoir is also an \n\nextremely relevant factor. The transparency of water, for example, is high in the \n\nupstream region (SGUp) influenced by the waters of the Chavantes reservoir \n\n(Paranapanema River) located upstream, and low at the mouth of the Pardo River \n\n(SG1). The opposite pattern of variation, as expected, was verified for turbidity and \n\nsuspended solids. In the case of turbidity values&lt;5 NTU occurred in the SGUp and SG2 \n\n(wet and dry seasons) and >80 NTU in SG1 (wet season). \n\nIt is a reservoir where isothermal conditions prevail, with continuous and \n\ncomplete mixing of the water column (high oxygen values). Tendency for surface \n\nstratification (microstratification) during the wet season in the lentic region was \n\ndetected. The pH values observed in the Salto Grande reservoir showed a significant \n\nseasonal variation, with more neutral values in the wet season and slightly basic ones \n\nin the wet season. \n\nThe highest concentrations of total nitrogen were observed at SG1 9Pardo river \n\nmouth) and SGDam, also under the influence of Pardo River. The same occurred for \n\ntotal phosphorus and chlorophyll a. \n\nCanoas II reservoir \n\nThe results for Canoas II reservoir demonstrate the existence of a moderate \n\nspatial gradient between the upstream zone and the dam zone. Seasonally important \n\nchanges in the dynamics of the system were observed. There was an increasing trend \n\nof transparency towards the dam (lentic environment). Likewise, a decreasing \n\nlongitudinal gradient of the turbidity and suspended solids concentration was \n\nobserved. \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\nIn terms of thermal structure, there was a prevalence of isothermal conditions \n\nor a slightly gradual decrease of temperature with depth. The concentrations of \n\ndissolved oxygen were high and had a vertical distribution pattern similar to that \n\nobserved for temperature, with relatively homogeneous values along the water \n\ncolumn or with small gradients. The pH values showed a considerable variation \n\ntemporal variation, tending to a more basic condition in the wet season and \n\nintermediate values in the dry season. The concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus) were similar between the different regions of the reservoir for the same \n\nseason. \n\nCanoas I reservoir \n\nThe Canoas I reservoir is highly influenced by the seasonal variations. Spatially \n\n(longitudinal), it presented a moderate compartmentalization. A considerable \n\nreduction of water transparency was observed during the wet season period. \n\nLongitudinally there was an increase in transparency, with lower values at CIUp and \n\nhigher values at CI1. The inverse, that is, a decreasing gradient towards the dam, was \n\nverified for suspended solids (wet season). \n\nMuch higher concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and total phosphorus) in \n\nwater occurred in the wet season and lower in the dry season. \n\nDuring both season predominated isothermal profiles or micro stratification \n\ntendencies close to the surface in CI1 and CIDam. This thermal structure indicates a \n\ncontinuous circulation of the water mass in the system, resulting in a homogeneous or \n\nrelatively homogeneous distribution of the others physical and chemical variables \n\nalong the water column. An increasing gradient of chlorophyll a towards the dam zone \n\noccurred in the dry season. \n\nCapivara reservoir \n\nThe results obtained in the Capivara reservoir demonstrate the great influence \n\nof both spatial compartmentalization and seasonal variation on the physical and \n\nchemical characteristics. An increasing longitudinal gradient of transparency evidences \n\nthe highest light penetration in the lacustrine zone. The temperature profiles show \n\ndifferent conditions along the reservoir. In the wet season it was seen increasing \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\ngradients of temperature and superficial stratifications, contrasting to more isothermal \n\nconditions in the dry season. This variability in the thermal structure influenced the \n\ndistribution of oxygen. In general, the concentrations were high, although slightly \n\nlower in summer due to the higher temperatures. \n\nThe spatial compartmentalization of the system was also indicated by variations \n\nin the conductivity values between the different sampling sites. \n\nThe pH values remained close to neutrality or were slightly basic. This variable \n\nis also an indicator of the spatial complexity of the system. \n\nIn the dry season, there was a wide variation of the suspended solids \n\nconcentration, up to 20 times, according to the sampling site. During this period there \n\nwas a decreasing trend toward the dam. \n\nThe concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) varied widely \n\namong the different compartments of the reservoir. The nutrients and chlorophyll a \n\nconcentrations can be considered relatively high when compared to the other \n\nreservoirs of the Paranapanema River. \n\nTaquaru\u00e7u reservoir \n\nThe results obtained in the Taquaru\u00e7u reservoir show a limited spatial \n\ncompartmentalization. However, there was considerable seasonal changes. \n\nAlthough transparency values were higher in the dam area during dry season, a \n\nlongitudinal gradient from the upstream was not evident. The same was observed for \n\nthe suspended solids. \n\nIsothermal condition or small decreasing gradients of temperature, was \n\nobserved at the different sampled sites along the reservoir. The continuous mixing \n\ncondition of the water column causes the oxygen values to be high in both seasons. \n\nThe pH was close to neutrality or slightly basic in the dry and wet season. The \n\nconcentrations of nutrients were much higher in the rainy season. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nRosana reservoir \n\nThe results obtained in the Rosana reservoir show a moderate influence of the \n\nspatial compartmentalization on the physical and chemical characteristics of the water. \n\nHowever, the effects of seasonality are clear. \n\nWater transparency, for example, showed lower values in the wet season and \n\nturbidity data were higher in both seasons There was no recurring tendency of \n\nincrease or decrease in transparency along the main axis of the reservoir. However, a \n\nlongitudinal decrease of the suspended material was verified for the wet season. \n\nIn both seasons and sites the vertical profiles of temperature are homogeneous \n\nor have small decreasing gradients. This pattern determines the homogeneous \n\ndistribution of oxygen throughout the water column. Comparatively, lower \n\nconcentrations of oxygen occurred in the wet season, certainly due to the negative \n\ninfluence of higher temperatures. \n\nThe pH was slightly basic in the wet season and intermediate in the dry season.  \n\nThe RS1 station is located in the river-reservoir transition zone of the reservoir, \n\nafter a sharp curve of the river, where the sedimentation of particles is intense \n\nresulting in higher concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids, and also \n\nhlorophyll a (dry season). \n\nNutrient concentrations (nitrogen and phosphorus) were higher in the wet \n\nseason compared to dry season. \n\n \n\nBased on the limnological characteristics of each reservoir we can verify the \n\ndistinctiveness of the two types of hydropower reservoirs defined in terms of \n\nfunctioning: storage and run-of-river systems. Both exhibit riverine, intermediate, and \n\nlentic compartments, but better discriminated in storage systems. In run-of-river \n\nreservoirs (short water retention time), the shape is generally simpler and shallower, \n\nand the water level variation has of low amplitude and high frequency (daily) as seen \n\nin Salto Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, Taquaru\u00e7u and Rosana. Conversely, Jurumirim, \n\nChavantes and Capivara are typical storage reservoir, with dendritic shapes, greater \n\nphysical stability, depth, volume, area, and variation in water level, and also seasonal \n\nthermal stratification. Such patterns have been previously demonstrated in Brazil by \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nSoares et al. (2008), Nogueira et al. (2012) and Perbiche-Neves et al. (2013) and \n\nsupports the second hypothesis proposed by this work. \n\nIn a comparative study of Chavantes and Salto Grande Perbiche-Neves et al., \n\n(2013) detected that due to the longer water retention time and larger area, \n\ncompartmentalization in Chavantes Reservoir was more evident. There was \n\ncontrasting conditions between the lotic region and the intermediate/lentic one. The \n\nauthor also pointed out for Salto Grande that the lateral variability was proportionally \n\nmore important with a clear influence of the Pardo River entrance, and also a certain \n\ndegree of separation of Novo River entrance (correspond to our 16 site \u2013 SG3), \n\nespecially due to the influx of water with lower transparency and higher \n\nconcentrations of suspended solids. \n\nThe rainfall pattern is similar along the cascade reservoirs, with higher values in \n\nsummer (December-February) and lower in autumn/winter (April to September). This \n\nseasonal regime had already been identified as an important factor influencing the \n\nlimnological functioning of the distinct Paranapanema River reservoirs (Nogueira et al., \n\n2002, 2006; Jorcin and Nogueira, 2005; Pagioro et al., 2005; Henry et al., 2006; \n\nNogueira et al., 2012). \n\nAccording to Cunha et al. (2013) the prediction of trophic state may be more \n\ncomplex in tropical/subtropical freshwaters because there are more environmental \n\nconstraints controlling nutrient dynamics and the phytoplankton responses in such \n\nwater bodies. The main reason for establishing a specific index for tropical/subtropical \n\nreservoirs different from the Carlson\u2019s one is that this classical model only considers \n\nthe highest productive seasons in temperate lakes (spring and summer), whilst \n\ntropical/subtropical systems may have high primary production through the year (e.g. \n\nCalijuri and Santos, 2001). High rainfall in tropical/subtropical regions may increment \n\nthe nonpoint sources from urban or agricultural areas and unbalance the \n\nbiogeochemical cycles (Qin et al., 2010; Thothong et al., 2011; Cunha et al., 2013). High \n\ntemperatures increase evaporation rates (Freire et al., 2009) and possibly affect the \n\ncirculation movements in the reservoirs water column. \n\nThe increasing trophic gradient observed along the cascade of Paranapanema \n\nRiver reservoirs is evidenced by differences in the concentration of total dissolved \n\nsolids or particulates in water, reflecting variations of geological nature, soil use and \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\noccupation, and precipitation/evaporation rate (Jorcin and Nogueira, 2005). Therefore, \n\nour first hypothesis is corroborated. The influence of the intensification of the land use \n\nin the Paranapanema River middle stretches is a determinant process, comparable to \n\nthe influence of the river damming. \n\nThe proper discrimination of the main tendencies of limnological variability and \n\nrecurrent patterns could be useful to improve the programs of reservoirs \n\nenvironmental management as well as the water quality monitoring protocols. \n\nReferences \n\nAgostinho, A.A.; Gomes, l.C. and Pelicice, F.M. 2007.

The selected indexes were Water Quality Index \n\n(WQI), Trophic State Index (Carlson, 1977 and some derived modified models), \n\nPhytoplankton Community Index (FCI), Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI) and the \n\nPlanktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) - a new tool that has been recently \n\ndeveloped. The Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of the high Paran\u00e1 \n\nRiver (La Plata basin) and is the natural border between the states of Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo, Southern Brazil. The study was carried out in eight reservoirs, Jurumirim (JR), \n\nChavantes (CH), Salto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas I (CI), Capivara (CP), \n\nTaquaru\u00e7u (TQ) e Rosana (RS), arranged in a cascade system considering a total of 37 \n\nsampling sites and two seasons. The objective is to generated new insights on this \n\ntheme in order to improve the present water quality monitoring programs and to \n\nvalidate new useful protocols at the regional scale \u2013 a relatively large watershed from \n\nSoutheast Brazil. The Water Quality Index ranged from \u201cGood\u201d to \u201cExcellent\u201d \n\ndemonstrating the good quality of water. The original model of Carlson (1977) shows \n\nan overestimation by sensitively increasing the levels of eutrophication of the \n\nreservoirs while TSI models proposed by Carlson modified by Toledo and CETESB, \n\n(2006) for reservoirs are more suitable for tropical and subtropical environments, and \n\nTSI for tropical/subtropical reservoirs is the most sensitive. The Communities Indices \n\nmailto:jupomari@ibb.unesp.br\n\n\n71 \n \n\nFCI, ZCI, P-IBI can fairly represent water quality standards which were reinforced, \n\nespecially for zooplankton, through correlations made in this study. \n\nResumo  \n\nNeste estudo, aplicamos e comparamos os resultados de diferentes tipos de \u00edndices de \n\nqualidade de \u00e1gua para m\u00faltiplos usos, como abastecimento de \u00e1gua, avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nn\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos e prote\u00e7\u00e3o de comunidades aqu\u00e1ticas. Os \u00edndices selecionados foram: o \n\n\u00cdndice de Qualidade da \u00c1gua (WQI), o \u00cdndice de Estado Tr\u00f3fico (Carlson, 1977 e alguns \n\nmodelos modificados), o \u00cdndice de Comunidade Fitoplanct\u00f4nica (FCI), o \u00cdndice de \n\nComunidade Zooplanct\u00f4nica (ZCI) e o \u00cdndice Planct\u00f4nico de Integridade Bi\u00f3tica (P-IBI) - \n\numa nova ferramenta que foi recentemente desenvolvida. O Rio Paranapanema \u00e9 um \n\ndos principais afluentes do Alto Rio Paran\u00e1 (bacia do Prata) e \u00e9 fronteira natural entre \n\nos estados do Paran\u00e1 e S\u00e3o Paulo, no sul do Brasil. O estudo foi realizado em oito \n\nreservat\u00f3rios, Jurumirim (JR), Chavantes (CH), Salto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas \n\nI (CI), Capivara (CP), Taquaru\u00e7u (TQ) e Rosana ), dispostos em cascata e considerando \n\num total de 37 locais de amostragem em duas esta\u00e7\u00f5es. O objetivo \u00e9 gerar novos \n\ninsights sobre esse tema para melhorar os atuais programas de monitoramento da \n\nqualidade da \u00e1gua e validar novos protocolos \u00fateis \u00e0 escala regional \u2013 em uma bacia \n\nhidrogr\u00e1fica relativamente grande do Sudeste do Brasil. O \u00cdndice de Qualidade da \u00c1gua \n\nvariou entre \"Bom\" e \"Excelente\" demonstrando a boa qualidade da \u00e1gua. O modelo \n\noriginal proposto por Carlson, (1977) do \u00cdndice de Estado Tr\u00f3fico (TSI) mostra uma \n\nsuperestima\u00e7\u00e3o ao aumentar sensivelmente os n\u00edveis de eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nreservat\u00f3rios enquanto que os modelos propostos por Carlson modificados por Toledo \n\ne CETESB, (2006) para reservat\u00f3rios, s\u00e3o mais adequados para ambientes tropicais e \n\nsubtropicais, enquanto o TSI para tropicais/subtropicais se mostrou o mais sens\u00edvel \n\npara os ambientes estudados. Os \u00edndices de comunidades FCI, ZCI, P-IBI podem \n\nrepresentar adequadamente padr\u00f5es de qualidade da \u00e1gua, refor\u00e7ada neste estudo, \n\nespecialmente para a comunidade zooplanct\u00f4nica, atrav\u00e9s de correla\u00e7\u00f5es desta com \n\nas vari\u00e1veis limnol\u00f3gicas e os \u00edndices de qualidade de \u00e1gua e estado tr\u00f3fico. \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\nKey words: Reservoir cascade system, Water Quality Index (WQI), Trophic State Index  \n\nPhytoplankton Community Index (FCI), Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI), Planktonic \n\nIndex of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI). \n\nIntroduction \n\nAs complex ecological systems with multiple uses, reservoirs present a \n\nhierarchy of functions, mechanisms of feedback, regulation, and control (Tundisi, \n\n2008). In order to assess such complex systems, the use of integrated indices and \n\nindicators are frequently used in environmental monitoring programs and are \n\ngenerally based on selected abiotic factors or community structure indicators (Thomaz, \n\n2000). \n\nEnvironmental indices and indicators emerged as result of the growing social \n\nconcern for the environmental aspects of socioeconomic development, a process that \n\nrequires a large number of information organized in distinct degrees of complexity \n\n(CETESB, 2015). The main goal of indices is to assess the present condition of the \n\nenvironment and monitor trends over time. They can provide an early warning signal \n\nof changes in the environment and they be used to diagnose the causes of \n\nenvironmental problems (Dale and Beyeler, 2001). \n\nEnvironmental indicators should represent key information about structure, \n\nfunction, and composition of the ecosystem (Dale and Beyeler 2001). They need to \n\ncapture the ecosystem complexities but remain simple enough to be easily and \n\nroutinely monitored and have the following criteria: be easily measured, be sensitive \n\nto stresses on the system, respond to stress in a predictable manner, be anticipatory, \n\npredict changes that can be averted by management actions, be integrative, have a \n\nknown response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time, and \n\nhave low variability in response (Dale and Beyeler 2001). \n\nThe most challenging problem on selection of environmental indices and \n\nindicators is to understand the fundamental principles of ecology, also the inherent \n\ncomplexity of environmental problems and the limitations of using just a single \n\nindicator or indices that integrate information across a range of attributes and/or \n\ndifferent levels of biological organization (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999; Wetzel, 2001). \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n Appropriate water quality indices can be useful for management purposes \u2013 \n\nstakeholder\u2019s decision processes, improvement of monitoring protocols, and \n\nexpansion of scientific knowledge, as well as to disseminate the results of the analyses \n\nto citizens (Kane at al., 2009) and to make it possible is inherent to take into account \n\nthat a proper choice of an index or indicators must be intrinsically related to the \n\nstudied environment and will often present such regional character, which means that \n\nthey will probably need some adaptation, but always taking into account the thought \n\non which this was based. \n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo State (Brazil), the official environmental agency called Companhia \n\nde Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental (CETESB), has monitored the water bodies for \n\nalmost three decades, always focused on public supply requirements. Nevertheless, \n\nmost surficial water ecosystems of this State are considered as Class 1 and 2 (Decree \n\nNo. 10,755) (S\u00e3o Paulo, 1977), which are equivalent to Special Class and Class 1 of the \n\nfederal CONAMA Resolution 357 (Brazil, 2005). This legislation predicts a more \n\ncomprehensive set of uses including \"to preserve the balance natural of aquatic \n\ncommunities\". Therefore, it is important that the water quality monitoring programs \n\nalso consider the biota composition and structure. \n\n According to this, the Special Class is destined: a) to the supply for human \n\nconsumption, with disinfection; B) the preservation of the natural balance of aquatic \n\ncommunities; and (c) the preservation of aquatic environments in fully protected \n\nconservation units, while Class 1 may be destined for: (a) supply for human \n\nconsumption after simplified treatment; (b) protection of aquatic communities; (c) \n\nrecreation of primary contact, such as swimming, water skiing and diving, (d) irrigation \n\nof raw vegetables and fruits that grow on the ground and are eaten raw without film \n\nremoval; and (e) the protection of aquatic communities in Indigenous lands. \n\n Although there is not an ideal model to measure environmental impacts, there \n\nare available options for selection and development of indices and indicators. More \n\napplied approaches have been requested by engineers and managers who work in the \n\nmanagement of reservoirs, in order to complement the basic limnological studies \n\nperformed by academic institutions (Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 2003; Tundisi, \n\n2006). \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\nBased on a study carried out in the 1970\u2019s by the National Sanitation \n\nFoundation of United States, CETESB adapted and developed a regional Water Quality \n\nIndex (WQI) to assess the water quality with the purpose of public supply. The WQI \n\nconsider nine parameters: water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical \n\noxygen demand, thermotolerant coliforms, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total \n\nsolids, and turbidity). The WQI is a widely accepted index and commonly used in water \n\nquality monitoring and the proposal was based on an opinion survey (Delphi method) \n\nwith specialists in water quality. They were argued about the variables to be evaluated, \n\nthe relative weight and the condition with which each parameter is presented, mainly \n\nin order to evaluate the contamination of the water bodies caused by the discharge of \n\ndomestic sewage (CETESB 2006). \n\nA trophic state index for temperate lakes was proposed by Carlson (1977), \n\nconsidering empirical relationships among Chlorophyll a (Chl a), Total Phosphorus (TP) \n\nand Secchi disk depth (SDD). This index has frequently been applied by researchers and \n\ngovernment institutions to, indirectly, estimate the algal biomass and indicate lake \n\ntrophic status. However, it is known that the relationships and the equations for \n\ncalculating the index should be adapted when applied to aquatic systems different \n\nfrom those studied by Carlson. Otherwise results of the index application can lead to \n\nmisclassification of the trophic status of a water body (Cunha et al., 2013). \n\nCurrently, in Brazil, there are modifications of Carlson original model\u00b4s based on \n\nthe prediction that the trophic state may be more complex in tropical/subtropical \n\nfreshwaters because there are more environmental constraints controlling nutrient \n\ndynamics and phytoplankton responses in such water bodies (Cunha et al., 2013). \n\nThese modifications take into account the same reasoning, but they present changes in \n\nthe calculation, in the number of variables analyzed and also in the weighting given to \n\neach one of them. \n\nAlthough the previously mentioned indices are widely recognized and used, in \n\n1998, the SMA\n1\n-65 Resolution (S\u00e3o Paulo, 1998) established a working group to revise \n\nthe Water Quality Index (WQI) in order to consider the aquatic biota and develop \n\nother assessment methods, which consider biological indicators integrated with to \n\neutrophication indexes. This technical group was composed of experts from CETESB, \n                                                           \n1\n S\u00e3o Paulo State Environmental Secretary \u2013 Secretaria de Meio Ambiente, in Portuguese. \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\nUniversities and Research Institutes that generated a first version for biological indexes \n\nbased on phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos and fish communities (CETESB, 2006). \n\nWe selected two of the proposed indices, the Phytoplankton Community Index (FCI) \n\nand the Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI) for reservoirs, for our study. \n\nIn this study we applied, and compared, different types of water quality indices \n\nthat are considered to be appropriated for assessment of aquatic ecosystems for \n\nmultipurpose uses (e.g. water supply, hydropower generation, aquaculture, recreation, \n\nirrigation, aquatic community\u2019s protection). Our case study is focused on the \n\nParanapanema River Reservoir Cascade. The following indexes were selected: Water \n\nQuality Index (WQI), Trophic State Index (Carlson, 1977 and three regionally modified \n\nmodels), Phytoplankton Community Index (FCI), Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI) \n\nand the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) - a new tool that has been recently \n\ndeveloped (see more details in Chapter 4). \n\nThe objective of the study is to get new insights on this subject, contributing for \n\nthe evaluation and improvement of the water quality monitoring program carried out \n\nin a large hydrographic basin from Southeast Brazil. \n\nAdditionally, we present an exploratory analysis on plankton, mainly \n\nzooplankton, responses to water quality and trophic conditions variability in the \n\nPaaranapanema basin. The perspective is to incorporate available academic \n\ninformation on practical protocols for environmental evaluation and management. \n\nPhytoplankton and zooplankton samples are regularly sampled and analyzed as part of \n\nthe regional water quality monitoring program sponsored by the hydropower \n\ngeneration company. \n\nStudy area \n\nThe study was carried out in the Paranapanema River Reservoirs Cascade \n\nconsidering the same eight reservoirs and 37 sampling sites described in Chapter 1 \n\n(Fig. 1; Tables 1 and 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nThe Water Quality Index (WQI) was calculated using nine variables: water \n\ntemperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, thermotolerant \n\ncoliforms, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total solids, and turbidity. The \n\nmethodologies concerning each individual variable (sampling and analysis) are detailed \n\nin Chapter 1. The WQI calculation was performed according to CETESB (2006) \n\nmethodology and the results, which can range from 0 to 100 (the higher the value the \n\nbetter the water quality), were classified according to Table 1, also a CETESB (2006) \n\nmethodology recommendation. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Water Quality Index (WQI) classification. \n\nWQI Classification \n\nCategory Rating \n\nExcellent 79 &lt;WQI ? 100 \n\nGood 51 &lt;WQI ? 79 \n\nRegular 36 &lt;WQI ? 51 \n\nPoor 19 &lt;WQI ? 36 \n\nVery Poor WQI ? 19 \n\n \n\nFor the Trophic State Indices four variables were used: Secchi disc \n\ntransparency, total phosphorus, reactive soluble phosphorus and chlorophyll a. \n\nSampling methods and analysis for each variables are also detailed in Chapter 1. To \n\ncalculate the indices we used the original model proposed by Carlson (1977) and the \n\nCarson Index modified by Toledo (1983) (apud Mercante and Tucci, 1999), by CETESB \n\n(2009) - Trophic State Index for reservoirs and by Cunha et al. (2013) - Trophic State \n\nIndex for tropical/subtropical reservoirs. The classification is in accordance with each \n\nmethod, which has variations in the rating values and categories (in this case, the \n\nlower the value the better the water quality), but, to facilitate comparison, the similar \n\nclassifications were represented in the same colors (Table 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Classes of Trophic State Index. \n\nTSI Classification \nTSI \n\nCarlson \nTSI Carlson \n\nmod.

For the FCI Index it is considered the proportion of the main community groups \n\nand/or the density of the organisms and the concentration of chlorophyll a or TSI (Chl \n\na). However, the numerically dominant group of phytoplankton in the Paranapanema \n\nRiver reservoirs cascade, Cryptophyceae, is not considered in the model. Therefore, for \n\nthis analysis we used the total density (org. ml\n-1\n\n) instead of the phytoplanktonic \n\ndominant groups, as well as the Trophic State Index, Carlson modified by Toledo model \n\nfor Chlorophyll a. For the ZCI it is considered the presence of the three main \n\nzooplankton groups (Rotifers, Copepods and Cladocerans), Calanoida/Cyclopoida ratio \n\nand TSI. (Carlson modified by Toledo) (see CETESB, 2006). \n\nFor phytoplankton qualitative analysis, an integrated sample was collected \n\n(entire water column) at each sampling station through vertical net hauls (20 ?m of \n\nmesh size) and immediately preserved in 2% formalin. The net samples were observed \n\nin an optical microscope (maximum magnification of 1000\u00d7) for taxonomical \n\nidentification and determination of the assemblage total richness. For phytoplankton \n\nquantitative analysis, three unfiltered samples were collected (van Dorn bottle) at the \n\nsubsurface (ca. 0.2 m), middle of the water column and near to the bottom (ca. 1 m \n\nabove the sediment). The samples were fixed and preserved with Lugol\u2019s solution. \n\nAfter sedimentation, the organisms (cell, colony, and filament) were counted using \n\ninverted microscopy (sensu Uterm\u00f6hl) at a magnification of 400\u00d7. At least 120 optical \n\nfields distributed in parallel transects were examined, and at least 150 organisms were \n\ncounted per sample. A mean value for the water column was calculated for further use \n\nin the FCI index. Since the dominant phytoplankton group (Cryptophyceae) in \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\nParanapanema River reservoirs cascade does not appear in the CETESB classification \n\ntable, we use only the organisms\u2019 density and the trophic state. \n\nThe zooplankton samples were collected using a conical net (30 cm mouth \n\ndiameter and 50 ?m mesh size) for vertical hauls from near bottom (ca. 1 m) to the \n\nsurface. In each site we collected to identical samples, one for qualitative and the \n\nother for quantitative purpose. Samples were fixed and preserved in 4 % \n\nformaldehyde. For the quantitative analyses, most organisms were counted at species \n\nlevel. Rotifera, and nauplii of Copepoda were counted in Sedgwick\u2013Rafter chambers, \n\nunder optic microscope Zeiss Standard 25 (at a magnification of \u00d7 200); and Cladocera, \n\ncopepodites and adult stages of Copepoda were counted using a stereo microscope \n\nZeiss Stemi SV 6 (maximum magnification of \u00d7 120). At least 150 specimens were \n\ncounted per subsample. Additional sub-samples, or even the entire sample, were \n\nanalyzed when the density of organisms was low (generally less than 100 organisms \n\nper 5 ml of sample, in case of Cladocera and Copepoda, and less than 100 organisms \n\nper 1 ml of sample, in case of Rotifera). \n\nBoth phytoplankton and zooplankton were sampled during wet/summer \n\n(March/2011) and dry/spring (October/2011) seasons. \n\nThe Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) was calculated according to \n\nmethodology detailed in Chapter 4. As this index is derived from a proposal developed \n\nfor natural large lakes, it was only used for the Paranapanema storage reservoirs \n\n(theoretical water retention time higher than 100 days) (Jurumirim, Chavantes and \n\nCapivara). \n\nTo facilitate comparisons, the classification rating was also showed in term of \n\ncorresponding colors, equivalent for similar categories of the distinct indices. The FCI \n\nfor reservoir and P-IBI is according to Table 3 (with the lower the value of the \n\nclassification corresponding to the better the water quality) and ZCI for reservoirs \n\nTable 4. \n\n  \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 FCI for reservoir and P-IBI classification. \n\nClassification FCIRes P-IBI \n\nExcellent 1 Excellent \n\nGood 2 Good \n\nRegular 3 Fair \n\nBad 4 Poor \n\nVery Bad \n \n\nVery Poor \n\n \n\nTable 4 \u2013 ZCI for reservoir classification based on T.S.I. (Chla) and Calanoida/Cyclopoida \nratio. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn order to reinforce the potential of the zooplankton as bioindicator of water \n\nquality and corroborate the effectiveness of the Zooplankton Community Index for \n\nReservoirs (ZCIres) and Plankton Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI), we performed an \n\nexploratory analysis using the Pearson correlation (Pearson, p<0,05) Statistic v. 7.0 \n\n(Statsoft, 2002). \n\nThe following genera or species of zooplankton were settled on as indicators of \n\ntrophic state from a selected literature review: Brachionus sp., Collotheca sp. and \n\nFilinia sp. among Rotifers; Argyrodiaptomus sp., Notodiaptomus iheringi, \n\nThermocyclops decipiens, and Thermocylops minutus, among the Copepods; and \n\nBosmina sp. and Daphnia sp. among Cladocerans. Additionally we considered the total \n\nabundance and richness of Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda (with and without \n\nnauplii) and the relation Calanoida/Cyclopoida + Cladocera. Zooplankton data were \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\ncorrelated with the limnological variables (transparency, dissolved oxygen, biochemical \n\noxygen demand, conductivity, chlorophyll, total phosphorus, soluble reactive \n\nphosphorus, total nitrogen, total suspended solids, organic suspended solids, inorganic \n\nsuspended solids) (Chapter 1) and with the quantitative results of WQI and modified \n\nCarlson T.S.Is indexes for reservoirs (CETESB, 2006) and for tropical and subtropical \n\nreservoirs (Cunha et al., 2013). We selected some results for graphical presentation. \n\nAll data, except pH, were log-transformed and the parametric distributions was \n\nverified in the software Statistic v. 7.0 (Statsoft, 2002). \n\nThe selection of zooplankton metrics is based on published information which \n\nwas carried out using a selected literature review, focused on the studied environment \n\nand which have regionalized characteristics of the occurrence and distribution of the \n\norganisms in the Paranapanema River reservoirs and in S\u00e3o Paulo State reservoirs with \n\ndifferent trophic states as well as some classical related literature that showed the \n\npotential indicator of this community. The accumulated experience of our research \n\ngroup can be found in Sendacz et al., (1985); Panarelli et al., (2001); Nogueira, (2001); \n\nSampaio et al., (2002); Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi,(2003); Casanova and Henry, \n\n(2004); Lansac-Toha et al., (2004); Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, (2005); Landa et al., \n\n(2007); Nogueira et al., (2008); Tundisi, (2008); Silva, (2008); Sartori et al., (2009); \n\nPerbiche-Neves and Nogueira, (2010); Perbiche-Neves et al., (2016) and Nogueira and \n\nNaliato, (2016). \n\nFor all index calculations were used the mean value for the water column for \n\nthe limnological variables, except transparency. \n\nResults \n\nThe Water Quality Index (CEYESB 2006) for the Paranapanema River reservoirs \n\ncascade resulted in only two distinct classifications, Good and Excellent (Table 5, \n\nAppendix I). Among the 74 determinations the Excellent condition widely prevailed (64 \n\ntimes) over the Good condition (10 times). The index evidences a decrease in the \n\nwater quality condition during the wet season. In this period the proportion of \n\nsampling stations considered Excellent corresponded to 81.1 % and in the dry season it \n\nwas 91.9 %. \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\nIn order to facilitate comparison among the different models of Trophic State \n\nIndex applied for the Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade all the results are \n\nshowed in Table 6. Lower levels of trophy were obtained when used the Carlson Index \n\n(1977). Results ranged from Hypereutrophic (SG1) to Oligotrophic (CH3, CH4 and \n\nCHDam) in the wet season and from Hypereutrophic (CP1 and CP2) to Oligotrophic \n\n(JR3, JRDam and CHDam) in the dry season. Most sampling sites (70.3 % considering \n\nboth seasons) were classified as Mesotrophic according to this index. The same \n\nnumber (8 times) of lower trophic conditions (Hypereutrophic/Eutrophic) was found in \n\nwet and dry seasons. \n\nFor the Carlson Trophic State Index modified by Toledo (Mercante and Tucci, \n\n1999), the Eutrophic condition was determined four times (SG1, wet season; CP1, CP2 \n\nand RS1, dry season). All others classifications varied between Oligo (71.6 %) and \n\nMesotrophic (21.6 %) conditions, during both wet and dry seasons (Table 6). Following \n\nthe original Carlson Index this model also indicates a decrease in the water quality \n\nduring the rainy season. \n\nThe results of the Trophic State Index for Reservoirs proposed by CETESB (2006) \n\nare similar to the ones of Carlson modified by Toledo, showing the predominance of \n\nOligotrophic and Mesotrophic conditions, 29.7 and 59.5% of the determinations, \n\nrespectively (Table 6). The stations with the best trophic conditions according to this \n\nmodel were JR3, JRDam and CH3, which were classified as Ultraolithotrophic during \n\nthe dry season when was detected an improvement of the water quality. \n\nThe most recent model of Trophic State Index proposed for tropical and \n\nsubtropical reservoirs (Cunha et al., 2013) indicated predominance of Ultraoligotrophic \n\nconditions, corresponding to 77.0 % of the sampling sites (Table 6), followed by \n\nOligotrophic condition (17.6 %). The index was also sensitive to poor condidition in wer \n\nseason, when one sites was classified as Eutrophic (SG1). The total results of the TSI \n\nmodels presented here are shown in Appendices II, III, IV and V. \n\nThe use of Phytoplankton Community Index for reservoir (FCI) resulted in \n\nsimilar proportion of Good and Excellent conditions, 47.3 and 51.3 % of the \n\ndeterminations, respectively (Table 7). Only one Regular condition was detected (SG1, \n\nwet season). Differently, for the Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI) the condition \n\nExcellent was not determined. Most sites were classified as Good (72.9 %) or Regular \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n(21.6 %), which could be observed in most sampled sites for both seasons (Table 7). \n\nThe sites SG1 and SG3 were classified as Bad conditions in both wet and dry seasons, \n\naccording to the ZCI. Both plankton indices were not sensitive to the seasonal \n\nvariation. \n\nThe Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) showed that most sites are in \n\nExcellent conditions (75 %) and the others are Good (25 %). Regular, Bad and Very Bad \n\nconditions were not detected. Jurumirim reservoir exhibited a higher number of \n\nsampled sites with \"Good\" conditions when compared with the others (Table 8). There \n\nwas no remarkable difference between wet and dry season. \n\nThree hundred and ninety nine correlations among distinct zooplankton metrics \n\nand environmental variables/integrated indices were performed (Appendix IV). Some \n\nvariables that had significant correlations with zooplankton were also evidenced in the \n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) shown in Chapter 1 (e.g. transparency, turbidity, \n\ninorganic and organic suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, \n\ntemperature, pH and dissolved oxygen). \n\nWe selected for graphical representation a set of significant correlations (p \n\n<0.05) (Figure 1). Conversely, although significant some correlations were not \n\nconsidered either because its amplitude of variation was not sensitive to capture \n\nenvironmental distinctiveness for the Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade (e.g. \n\ndissolved oxygen that also exhibits high values) (Chapter 1) or because the particular \n\nvariable (e.g. temperature) is not directly related to water quality. \n\nAmong rotifers the genera Brachionus sp. and Filinia sp. were correlated with \n\ntrophic increase (water quality decrease), while the genus Collotheca sp. exhibited an \n\nopposite tendency. For microcrustaceans we observed that Calanoida was correlated \n\nwith good water quality and low trophic levels as well as for Cladocerans, and the \n\nopposite, was observed for Cyclopoida. For lower microcrustacean taxonomic level it \n\ncan mention the inverse relationship of T. minutus with total phosphorus and the \n\ninverse relationship of Daphnia with TSI mod.

In order achieve a \n\nmore accurate assessment of ecosystem \"health\" and adjust to a multiple uses \n\nperspective, it is essential to conduct sensitive and robust biomonitoring programs. \n\nResults should provide an integrated view of the operating natural processes, as well \n\nas the effects of human actions and a rich variety of signals, which can be used to \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\ndiagnose environmental degradation (Karr, 2006; Kanne et al., 2009; Nogueira and \n\nNaliato, 2016). \n\nThe application of different water quality/trophic state indices in the \n\nParanapanema River reservoirs cascade exhibited different responses. For a better \n\ninterpretation it is imperative to consider that water quality concept is not absolute; \n\nthe terms \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d water quality have definite meaning only in relation to the \n\nuse of water and the assessment of the user (Parparov et al., 2010). \n\nFor monitoring programs to select the appropriate indicators and to provide \n\ninformation that contributes for management decisions, it is critical that the \n\nmanagement questions and required information be clearly articulated and \n\nunderstood (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999). In this way, the Water Quality Index (WQI) \n\nhas been regularly used in monitoring programs and it is considered a robust and \n\nreliable index once it is composed of physical, chemical and biological variables \n\npreviously established by experts to detect the quality of water for public supply \n\npurposes. In addition to these, it is essential to consider that when the results are \n\ncompared to those described in a more traditional limnological studies (i.e., Chapter \n\n1), they are fairly adequate in describing environmental conditions.   \n\nAccording to Thornton and Kennedy, (1999) limnologists have long used \n\nbroadly defined terms to describe complex changes associated with eutrophication \n\ni.e., eutrophic lakes are characterized as having high nutrients and algal abundance, \n\nwhile the opposite is true for oligotrophic lakes \n\nParparov et al. (2010) showed that water quality assessed with the Trophic \n\nState Index (TSI) is more suitable for needs of natural water resources management, if \n\neutrophication is a major threat.  Contrastingly, the WQI allows accounting for several \n\nwater resource uses and therefore it is a more robust and comprehensive tool for \n\nwater quality quantification and thus for sustainable water resources management. \n\nIn the last decades we have faced a discussion related to the misuse of the \n\noriginal TSI model proposed by Carlson (1977) for tropical/subtropical regions and \n\nregardless of the type of environment system (i.e. lakes, rivers, reservoirs, flooded \n\nareas). Carlson (1977) developed the Trophic State Index (TSI) for temperate lakes. It \n\nintegrates information about nutrient (phosphorus) concentration, chlorophyll, and \n\ntransparency (Secchi disk depth). The purpose of the trophic status index is to classify \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nwater bodies into different degrees of trophy, i.e. to assess water quality changes \n\nrelated to nutrient enrichment (Zagatto et al., 1999), and a number of studies were \n\ncarried out proposing modifications, or minor adaptations to better meet the criteria \n\nand purposes of this index for particular habitat/regional characteristics. \n\nAn important consideration is that temperate and tropical/subtropical aquatic \n\nsystems have specific sensitivities to eutrophication (Huszar et al., 2006), because they \n\nare exposed to different stressors magnitude concerning climatological attributes and \n\nland use shifts, with corresponding changes in physical, chemical and biological \n\ncharacteristics of the aquatic ecosystem (Ortiz- Jimenez et al., 2006). The prediction of \n\ntrophic state may be more complex in tropical/subtropical freshwaters because there \n\nare more environmental constraints controlling nutrient dynamics and the \n\nphytoplankton responses in such water bodies (Cunha et al., 2013). \n\nAccording to Cunha et al., (2013) the main reason for establishing a specific \n\nindex for tropical/subtropical regions is that the Carlson\u00b4s model only considers the \n\nhighest productive seasons in temperate lakes (spring and summer), whilst \n\ntropical/subtropical systems may have high primary production through all the year \n\n(Calijuri and Santos, 2001). \n\nThe TSIs comparative analyses are easier to be interpreted if one has solid \n\ninformation on the limnological structure and functioning of considered environment \n\nand of the methodological development of the selected models. In case of the \n\nParanapanema River reservoirs cascade if we compare the limnological data presented \n\nin Chapter 1, with the results of the original proposal of Carlson (1977), we observed \n\nthat this model overestimates the trophic condition - most sampling sites were \n\nclassified as Mesotrophic or even Eutrophic and Hypereutrophic. \n\nThe Carlson TSI models modified by, Toledo 1983 (apud Mercante and Tucci, \n\n1999) and by CETESB (2006) for reservoirs showed to be more appropriated for \n\ntropical and subtropical environments. In case of the first modified model around 70 % \n\nof the Paranapanema reservoirs determinations resulted in Oligotophic conditions, \n\nfollowed by Mesotrophic, 27 %. For the second it was around 60 and 30 %, for \n\nOligotrophic and Mesotrophic, respectively. These results are more realistic if \n\nconsidered the low concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll commonly \n\nfound in the Paranapanema reservoirs (Chapter 1; Henry, 2014; Nogueira et al., 2006; \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nPerbiche-Neves et al., 2011; Nogueira et al., 2014l). These models were also sensitive \n\nto the seasonal changes, capturing the water quality decrease during the rainy season \n\n(higher input of sediments/nutrients). A difference to be considered between both \n\nmodels is that the first does not take into account the type of environment, such as the \n\nreservoir ecosystem particularities that are considered in the second. \n\nThe TSI for tropical/subtropical reservoirs is the most recent proposed model \n\n(Cunha et al., 2013). It considered relevant ecological aspects for an appropriate \n\nassessment, including geographic positioning (tropical/subtropical region) and it was \n\ntested in a large number of reservoirs in the S\u00e3o Paulo State for validation purpose. \n\nThe results of its application showed to be a sensitive model with most classifications \n\nresulting as Ultraoligotrophic (77 %) followed by Oligotrophic (17.6 %) which can be \n\nassociated with the truly lower concentration of nutrients. Seasonality was not \n\ndetected, as well. Similar results were obtained for WQI, but in this case, seasonality \n\nwas better captured, resulting Excellent for 70 % of the determinations during the wet \n\nseason and 95 % in the dry season. \n\nThe incorporation of aquatic biota information, biomonitoring programs, \n\nassociated with the conventional study of abiotic variables, is a strategy that \n\npossibilities better environmental diagnosis in order to generate concrete subsidies for \n\nthe water resources management. Monitoring based on physical and chemical \n\nparameters, even including microbiological determinations, may be insufficient for a \n\nconclusive analysis of the diverse ecological dimensions of an aquatic system (Nogueira \n\nand Naliato, 2016). \n\nOrganisms integrate time and space in a more conservative manner than \n\nphysical and chemical variables and the incorporation of information on aquatic biota \n\ninto water monitoring programs is a necessary strategy for alignment with the most \n\nadvanced regulations (Nogueira and Naliato, 2016). By studying the ecological \n\nattributes (presence/absence, richness, abundance, dominance, equitability, \n\ntaxonomic and functional diversity) of aquatic communities, it is possible to cover the \n\nwide range of environmental conditions in the watershed and their potential effects on \n\nthe aquatic biota (CETESB, 2006; Bonada et al., 2006; Nogueira and Naliato. 2016). \n\nIn our study, we have tried to use the available information on plankton \n\ncommunities of the Paranapanema reservoirs cascade in a water quality approach. \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\nBased on the application of the Communities Indices for reservoirs (FCI and ZCI) \n\nproposed by CETESB (2006) we can assume that they have a good potential to \n\nrepresent water quality standards when compared to the already established WQI and \n\nTSI indices. The FCI resulted classified the studied sites in only two categories, Excellent \n\n(52 %) and Good (48 %). The ZCI resulted to be more sensitive to trophic increase, with \n\n73 % of the determinations as Good, 22 % as Regular and 5 % as Bad. However, it is \n\nimportant to mention that the lack of data and published results from these plankton \n\nindices applications, fundamental for comparison, is a difficulty that certainly can not \n\nbe ignored. \n\nThe Planktonic Index of Biotic (P-IBI) is a new tool for evaluation of lake \n\nintegrity (Kane et al., 2009). The first Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) proposed by Karr et \n\nal. (1986) recognizes the importance of interactions among five classes of main factors \n\nto the aquatic biota: energy, chemical constituents, habitat structure, hydrology, and \n\ninteractions between organisms. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency \n\ndeveloped a guidance for establishing biological criteria and biologically assessing for \n\nlakes and reservoirs (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999). \n\nChapter 4 deals specifically with the development and validation of the P-IBI \n\nproposal for Paranapanema River large reservoirs (Jurumirim, Chavantes and \n\nCapivara). The application of this index resulted in only two categories, Excellent, 75% \n\nof the determinations, and Good, 25 % of the determinations. This was similar to the \n\nFCI classifications and, as also observed for the FCI and ZCI indices, the P-IBI was not \n\nsensitive to seasonal changes. \n\nIn addition to the indices application in the present work we put some effort \n\ntrying to understand the zooplankton responses to the environmental variability, \n\nconcerning water quality and trophic state differences. \n\nThe zooplankton is a fundamental component of the pelagic food web in lakes, \n\nlinking primary producers to higher consumers, and the limnological research has a \n\nlong tradition in investigating the mechanisms that govern zooplankton diversity and \n\nspecies succession (Obertegger et al., 2007). \n\nThe successful use of the zooplankton community as a potential bioindicator of \n\nenvironmental quality in freshwater has already been reported (Pace and Orcutt, 1981; \n\nFerdous and Muktadir, 2009), especially when analyzing some ecological attributes of \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\nthe community (richness, abundance, dominance, diversity). The association of species \n\nto altered (eutrophic) or preserved (oligotrophic) environments, even for the \n\nParanapanema basin, are cited in the scientific literature (Nogueira et al., 2008). \n\nFurthermore, Perbiche-Neves et al. (2016) studies showed that zooplankton \n\nabundance (generally dominated by few species) is positively correlated to high values \n\nof chlorophyll and nutrients (especially N and P) and negatively to conductivity and \n\ndissolved oxygen. Besides these general trends, individual response of each species is \n\nless known but would be desirable to simplify biomonitoring schemes by using a \n\nsmaller number of species with the best response to eutrophication processes. \n\nThe simultaneous application and comparison of distinct water quality and \n\ntrophic state indices (WQI, TSI and TSI modifications, FCI, ZCI and P-IBI) is a new \n\napproach for the relatively well known, in terms of limnological features, \n\nParanapanema River reservoirs cascade. Results demonstrate the potential of using \n\nintegrated indices and plankton, mainly zooplankton, metrics as robust, as well \n\nsensitive, environmental indicators. For some models (e.g. FCI, ZCI, P-IBI) would be \n\nchallenging to incorporate a higher volume of data set to confirm the identified trends, \n\nand perhaps establish the new protocols for achieving a better management of these \n\nwater resources. \n\nEnvironmental indicators, when properly applied, provide valuable insight into \n\ncomplex environmental problems and can be used to effectively support the \n\nmanagement-decision process (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999). However, indicators are \n\nbased on simplifications and prudent choices must be made in data selection, \n\napplication, and interpretation. Managers must ensure that indicators are relevant to \n\nmanagement issues and target appropriate attributes of the environment. \n\nReferences \n\nBonada, N., Prat, N., Resh, V.

Tel.: +55 14 38800630; \n\nEmail address: jupomari@ibb.unesp.br \n\nAbstract \n\nHydropower represents more than two-thirds of Brazil\u2019s energy supply and several \n\nrivers have a series of dams along their course forming reservoir cascade systems, \n\nwhich create longitudinal discontinuities. The understanding of structure and \n\nfunctioning of plankton communities in reservoir ecosystems provide opportunities to \n\ninvestigate patterns of responses to cyclical variations and episodic disturbances. The \n\npurpose of this study is to improve the knowledge on zooplankton community \n\nstructure of the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade, with a special focus on \n\ndetecting patterns and species with indicative potential to evaluate environmental \n\nchanges. The zooplankton community structure and ecological attributes were \n\nevaluated for eight reservoirs, Jurumirim, Chavantes, Salto Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, \n\nCapivara, Taquaru\u00e7u and Rosana, considering 37 sampling sites and two seasons, wet \n\nand dry. To analyze zooplankton species as potential indicator of water quality and \n\ntrophic state we considered only storage (higher water retention time) reservoirs \n\n(Jurimirm, Chavantes and Capivara). Zooplankton data was correlated with total \n\nphosphorus, chlorophyll a and with the quantitative results of Water Quality Index. \n\nand Trophic State Index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs. A multivariate analyses was \n\nalso performed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) together with \n\nSIMPER analyses to examine the contribution of each variable to average \n\nresemblances between groups. The zooplankton community was composed by 112 \n\ntaxa distributed among the main groups, Rotifera (65), Copepoda (14) and Cladocera \n\n(33). The potential of a set of species as biondicators was evidenced, but there was no \n\nmailto:jupomari@ibb.unesp.br\n\n\n 109 \n \n\nremarkable species replacement by tolerant forms. This could be attributed to \n\ninherent variety of transient conditions involving hydrological, limnological, and \n\nbiological features, typical of reservoir ecosystems. Other point to be considered is \n\nthat in this basin the range of trophic conditions is still not too variable. Zooplankton is \n\nvaluable as indicators on changes in water quality and trophic conditions and can give \n\nus signs that the environment is undergoing changes before it\u2019s become drastic or \n\nirreparable. \n\nResumo \n\nHidrel\u00e9tricas representam mais de dois ter\u00e7os do suprimento de energia do Brasil e \n\nv\u00e1rios rios possuem uma s\u00e9rie de barragens ao longo do curso formando sistemas de \n\ncascata de reservat\u00f3rios, que criam descontinuidades longitudinais. A compreens\u00e3o da \n\nestrutura e do funcionamento das comunidades planct\u00f4nicas em ecossistemas de \n\nreservat\u00f3rios proporciona oportunidades para investigar padr\u00f5es de respostas a \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es c\u00edclicas e perturba\u00e7\u00f5es epis\u00f3dicas. O objetivo deste estudo \u00e9 aprimorar o \n\nconhecimento sobre a estrutura da comunidade do zoopl\u00e2ncton da cascata do \n\nreservat\u00f3rio do rio Paranapanema, com foco especial na detec\u00e7\u00e3o de padr\u00f5es e \n\nesp\u00e9cies como potencial indicador para avaliar as mudan\u00e7as ambientais. A estrutura \n\nda comunidade zooplanct\u00f4nica e atributos ecol\u00f3gicos foram analisados em oito \n\nreservat\u00f3rios, Jurumirim, Chavantes, Salto Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, Capivara, \n\nTaquaru\u00e7u e Rosana, considerando 37 pontos de amostragem e duas esta\u00e7\u00f5es, seca e \n\nchuva. Para analisar as esp\u00e9cies do zoopl\u00e2ncton como potencial indicador de qualidade \n\nda \u00e1gua e estado tr\u00f3fico consideramos apenas reservat\u00f3rios de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o (maior \n\ntempo de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua) (Jurumirim, Chavantes e Capivara). Os dados do \n\nzoopl\u00e2ncton foram correlacionados com f\u00f3sforo total, clorofila a e com os resultados \n\nquantitativos do \u00cdndice de Qualidade da \u00c1gua e \u00cdndice de Estado Tr\u00f3fico para \n\nreservat\u00f3rios tropicais/subtropicais. Realizou-se tamb\u00e9m uma an\u00e1lise de ordena\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nutilizando escalonamento multidimensional n\u00e3o-m\u00e9trico (NMDS) juntamente com \n\nan\u00e1lise SIMPER para examinar a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de cada vari\u00e1vel para semelhan\u00e7as \n\nm\u00e9dias entre os grupos. A comunidade zooplanct\u00f4nica foi composta por 112 t\u00e1xons \n\ndistribu\u00eddos entre os principais grupos, Rotifera (65), Copepoda (14) e Cladocera (33). \n\nUm conjunto de esp\u00e9cies com potencial para bioindicador foi evidenciado, mas n\u00e3o \n\n\n\n 110 \n \n\nhouve nenhuma substitui\u00e7\u00e3o esp\u00e9cies not\u00e1vel por formas tolerantes.

Access to energy is a fundamental \n\ndriver of economic growth, and during the next two decades, rivers around the world, \n\nincluding many currently free flowing rivers, are predicted to undergo development of \n\nhydropower plants that could double current global capacity (Opperman et al., 2015). \n\nHydropower accounts for more than two-thirds of Brazil\u2019s energy supply \n\n(Winemiller et al., 2015). Hydropower plants seems to be an attractive technology for \n\nmany countries because: 1) use of low-carbon source of energy; 2) In addition to direct \n\ngeneration, support a set of energy-related services, including renewable energy, such \n\nas wind and solar power; 3) is relatively low-cost domestic source of power that can be \n\nexploited with proven technology and 4) can provide and support multiple uses, from \n\nstorage to navigation (Opperman et al., 2015). \n\nIn Brazil, several rivers have a series of dams along their course forming \n\nreservoir cascade systems (Barbosa et al., 1999; Nogueira et al., 2006). This human \n\ninterference creates a series of alternating lotic and lentic stretches, discontinuities \n\nthat results in longitudinal shifts of riverine characteristics (Ward and Stanford 1983). \n\nThese shifts, which can be considered both negative (upstream) and positive \n\n(downstream), are also applied to the physical and chemical characteristics as well as \n\nthe attributes of biotic communities (Kennedy 1998).  \n\nStudies on the structure and functioning of planktonic communities in reservoir \n\necosystems provide opportunities to investigate patterns of responses to cyclical \n\n\n\n 111 \n \n\nvariations and episodic disturbances The understanding of plankton dynamics can be \n\nuseful to evaluate the resilience of this kind of ecosystem too, which can present deep \n\nchanges in limnological conditions in relatively short periods (Nogueira, 2001). \n\nThe use of zooplankton community characteristics as a tool for bioindication \n\nhas been considered for a long time with low informative value (Andronikova, 1996). \n\nHowever, zooplankton indices based on taxonomic composition, size distribution, \n\ntrophic levels, spatial patterns of distribution, functional characteristics and \n\nquantitative data may be of high informative potential, and should not be overlooked \n\nin monitoring studies (Gannon and Stemberger, 1978; Andronikova, 1996; Ferdous and \n\nMuktadir, 2009). \n\nZooplankton plays an important role in food web by linking the primary \n\nproducers, by consuming phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and even small zooplankton \n\norganisms, to higher trophic levels (Ferdous and Muktadir, 2009). Zooplankton \n\nrespond quickly to environment changes and act as an effective indicator of alterations \n\nin water quality, been more valuable as indicator of trophic conditions than has \n\ngenerally been considered (Gannon and Stemberger, 1978). \n\nThe structure and dynamics of the zooplankton community result from \n\ninteractions between fertility rates, mortality and dispersion of their populations. A \n\nlarge number of environmental variables constantly influences the zooplankton \n\nfunctional characteristics, directly and indirectly. Examples can include the effects of \n\ntemperature, quantity and frequency of precipitation, wind episodes, nutrient \n\navailability, food quality and quantity, intra and interspecific competition and \n\npredation (Nogueira and Matsumura-Tundisi, 1996; Serafim-J\u00fanior et al., 2005). \n\nModifications in the structure and dynamics of freshwater zooplankton, which \n\nis represented mainly by protozoans, rotifers, cladocerans and copepods, can spread \n\nalterations in the trophic structure (lower and higher levels), and, therefore, are \n\nrelevant for the entire ecosystem metabolism (Lansac-T\u00f4ha, et al., 2004). These \n\norganisms have a high growth rate, responding quickly to the impacts that alter the \n\nphysical and chemical conditions of the water (Sendacz et al., 1985; Matsumura-\n\nTundisi, 1999; Nogueira 2001; Serafim-J\u00fanior et al., 2003). \n\nIn these sense, the incorporation of information on aquatic biota, including the \n\nzooplankton community, in biomonitoring programs associated to the conventional \n\n\n\n 112 \n \n\nstudy of abiotic variables can be a strategy that enlarges the possibilities of diagnosis in \n\norder to generate concrete subsidies for an integrated management of surface water \n\nresources as pointed out by Nogueira and Naliato (2016). The authors also said that \n\nmonitoring based on physical and chemical parameters, and even including direct and \n\nindirect microbiological determinations, may be insufficient for a conclusive diagnosis \n\nof the different ecological dimensions of river systems. That is because of the risk of \n\nreflecting only momentary condition of the evaluated water system. \n\nThe potential use of the zooplankton community as successful water quality \n\nbioindicator has been reported (Pace and Orcutt, 1981; Ferdous and Muktadir, 2009). \n\nEspecially when analyzing some communities attributes, such as richness, abundance, \n\ndominance and diversity, associated to other aquatic biota data, the set of information \n\nmay contribute to a comprehensive strategic planning that must be applied at the \n\nbasin scale, with the goal of finding balance between exploitation of hydropower \n\npotential and sustainability of key natural resources (Winemiller et al., 2015). \n\nIn the Paranapanema River reservoirs, the zooplankton assemblages have been \n\nintensively studied, including analyses of faunal composition and diversity, effects of \n\nspatial compartmentalization, and seasonal cycles (e.g. Nogueira, 2001; Sampaio et al., \n\n2002; Nogueira et al., 2008; Sartori et al., 2009; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2010; \n\nPerbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2013). The first reservoir (Jurumirim) concentrates most \n\ninformation on zooplankton distribution and dynamics (Nogueira 2001; Casanova and \n\nHenry 2004; Mitsuka and Henry 2002; Panarelli et al. 2003; Sartori et al. 2009). \n\nSampaio et al. (2002) and Nogueira et al. (2008) also reported the zooplankton \n\nvariation along the reservoir cascade of the Paranapanema River. \n\nThe main goal of this study is to explore information on the structure of the \n\nzooplankton sampled in the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade (eight reservoirs), \n\nfocusing on the potential of this community to evaluate changes in water quality and \n\ntrophic level - biomonitoring purposes. \n\nIn the analysis of the zooplankton versus water quality and trophic state using \n\nlower taxonomical levels (species) as potential indicators it was considered only the \n\nthree larger storage reservoirs (Jurumirim, Chavantes and Capivara). The premise is \n\nthat they have water retention time higher than a hundred days what make possible \n\n\n\n 113 \n \n\nthe development of a proper plankton community (reduced limitation by intensive \n\nflow). \n\nStudy area \n\nThe study was carried out in the Paranapanema River Reservoirs Cascade \n\nconsidering, for zooplankton community structure and ecological attributes, the same \n\neight reservoirs and 37 sampling sites described in Chapter 1 (Fig. 1; Tables 1 and 2). \n\nMaterial and methods \n\nThe zooplankton samples were collected during wet/summer (March/2011) \n\nand dry/spring (October/2011) seasons using a conical net (30 cm mouth diameter and \n\n50 ?m mesh size) for vertical hauls from near bottom (ca. 1 m) to the surface. In each \n\nsite we collected two identical samples, one for qualitative and other for quantitative \n\npurpose. Samples were fixed and preserved in 4 % formaldehyde. For the quantitative \n\nanalyses, most organisms were counted at species level. Rotifera and nauplii of \n\nCopepoda were counted in Sedgwick\u2013Rafter chambers, under optic microscope Zeiss \n\nStandard 25 (at a magnification of \u00d7 200); and Cladocera, copepodites and adult stages \n\nof Copepoda were counted using a stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi SV 6 (maximum \n\nmagnification of \u00d7 120). At least 150 specimens were counted per subsample. \n\nAdditional sub-samples, or even the entire sample, were analyzed when the density of \n\norganisms was low (generally less than 100 organisms per 5 ml of sample, in case of \n\nCladocera and Copepoda, and less than 100 organisms per 1 ml of sample, in case of \n\nRotifera). The collected specimens are deposited in the Freshwater Invertebrate \n\nCollection of the Department of Zoology, Biosciences Institute (campus of Botucatu) of \n\nthe S\u00e3o Paulo State University. \n\nThe specimens of main zooplankton groups (Rotifer, Copepod and Cladocera) \n\nwere analyzed at the lowest taxonomic level, by specialized literature. The density of \n\nthe organisms were calculated from the volume of water filtered and the size of each \n\nsub sample, and expressed as numbers of individuals per cubic meter. The structure of \n\nthe zooplankton community was determined through species composition (list of taxa \n\nand respective occurrence) and ecological attributes: richness, total and relative \n\ndensity, Shannon-Wienner diversity (H ') and evenness (J'). \n\n\n\n 114 \n \n\nFor the analysis of the zooplankton species as potential indicator, data on \n\nindividual densities were correlated with total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and with the \n\nquantitative results of Water Quality Index (WQI) and Carlson Trophic State Index \n\nmodified and for tropical and subtropical reservoirs (T.S.Is ) (Chapter 2). All data were \n\npreviously log-transformed and significant correlations (p&lt;0.05) were retained. The \n\nsoftware Statistic v. 7.0 (Statsoft, 2002) was used. \n\nIn order to evidence community similarity among trophic status levels (T.S.I. for \n\ntropical and subtropical reservoirs) we used a multivariate analyses - non-metric \n\nmultidimensional scaling (NMDS) derived from a Bray\u2013Curtis similarity matrix with log \n\n(X+1) transformed data. Through SIMPER analyses, we examined the contribution of \n\neach variable to average resemblances between groups. PRIMER v6.0 was used. \n\nResults \n\nThe zooplankton community of the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade was \n\ncomposed of 112 taxa represented by Rotifera with 65 taxa (58%), Copepoda with 14 \n\ntaxa (12.5%) and Cladocera with 33 taxa (29.5%). The list of taxa, as well as the spatial \n\nand seasonal occurrence, is presented in Table 1. The most frequent species were \n\nConochilus unicornis (88%), Collotheca spp. (81%), Euchlanis dilatata (81%) and \n\nSynchaeta stylata (75%) among the rotifers; Notodiaptomus henseni (100%) and N. \n\niheringi (75%) among Copepoda Calanoida and Thermocyclops decipiens (100%), T. \n\nminutus (75%) and Microcyclops anceps (75%) among Copepoda Cyclopoida and the \n\ncladocerans Ceriodaphnia cornuta f. tipica (100%), Daphnia gessneri (100%), Bosmina \n\nhagmanni (94%), C. cornuta f. rigaudi (88%), C. silvestrii (88%), Bosmina freyi (81%), \n\nDiaphanosoma spinulosum (81%), D. birgei (75%) and Moina minuta (75%). \n\nThe highest values for richness were found in JR, 59 taxa during the dry season, \n\nfollowed by JR, CH and CP in the wet season, all with 51 taxa each. Conversely, the \n\nlowest values were found in TQ, 21 taxa (wet) followed by CI, 24 taxa (dry), CI (wet) \n\nand RS (dry), both with 25 taxa each (Fig. 1). \n\nThe total density highest values were observed in JR, CH and CP, being higher in \n\nJR with densities > 45,000 ind. m\n3\n in both seasons. Lower values occurred in RS (wet) \n\n217 ind. m\n3\n,\n \nfollowed by TQ (wet) 715 ind. m\n\n3\n, CI and CII (dry) with 807 and 854 ind. \n\nm\n3\n, respectively (Fig. 2). The highest densities values were found for the species \n\n\n\n 115 \n \n\nConochilus unicornis, Polyarthra spp., Synchaeta spp. and Synchaeta stylata among \n\nrotifers; Notodiaptomus henseni (calanoid) and Thermocyclops decipiens (cyclopoid) \n\namong copepods and Ceriodaphnia cornuta f. rigaudi, Moina minuta, Daphnia \n\ngessneri, C. cornuta f. tipica, C. silvestrii and Diaphanosoma spinulosum among \n\ncladocerans. \n\nThe relative abundance among the zooplankton groups are presented in Figure \n\n3a (wet season) and Figure 3b for dry season. During the wet season Rotifera \n\npredominated in the upstream portion of the river cascade \u2013 JR, CH, SG reservoirs and \n\nalso at CIIUp site, while Copepoda predominance was observed from CIIDam towards \n\ndownstream river. In the dry season, the dominance of Rotifera and Copepoda \n\nremained in the upper and lower portions of the river course, but there was an \n\nincrease of Cladocera representation. \n\nThe Shannon-Wienner diversity (H\u00b4) and evenness (J\u00b4) values were calculated \n\nper zoological group (Rotifer, Cladocera and Copepoda) and season (wet and dry). \n\nRotifer highest diversity values, greater than 3 bits. ind\n-1\n\n, occurred at JR1 and CHUp \n\n(wet) and at CP1 and TQUp (dry) while the lowest values occurred at TQ1 (wet) and \n\nSG1 (dry), both with 0 bits. ind\n-1\n\n. The highest evenness values, equal to 1, were found \n\nat CIUp, TQ2, RSUp (wet) and CII1, CIUp, TQUp, TQ2, RSUp and RSDam (dry), while the \n\nlowest values were observed at CP2 (wet) 0.437 and TQ1 (dry), equal to 0 (Fig. 4a and \n\n4b). For Copepoda, the highest diversity values occurred at TQ2, 2.44 bits. ind\n-1\n\n and \n\nCHDam, 1.99 bits. ind\n-1\n\n (wet) and in JR1, 2.02 bits. ind\n-1\n\n and CP4 2.31 bits. ind\n-1\n\n (dry) \n\nwhile the lowest values occurred at SG1, SG3 and CIUp (wet) all with 0 bits. ind\n-1 \n\nand \n\nCIIUp, 0.59 bits. ind\n-1\n\n, CP2, 0.64 bits. ind\n-1\n\n and CHUp, 0.69 bits. ind\n-1\n\n (dry). The highest \n\nevenness values were found at JR4, 0.996, CHUp, 0.985, TQ2, 0.945 (wet) and SG1, 1 \n\n(dry) while the lowest values were observed at SG1, SG3 and CIUp, equal to 0 (wet) \n\nand at TQDam, 0.356, CIIDam 0.357 and CI1, 0.399 (dry) (Fig. 4c and 4d). For \n\nCladocera, the highest diversity values occurred at CH4, 3.30 bits. ind\n-1\n\n, CPUp and \n\nCHDam, both with 3.19 bits. ind\n-1\n\n (wet) and at JR2, 2.98 bits. ind\n-1\n\n and CP1 2.94 bits. \n\nind\n-1\n\n (dry) while the lowest values, equal to 0 bits. ind\n-1\n\n,\n \n occurred in SG1, SG3 and RS1 \n\n(wet) and SG1 (dry).

The Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade is composed, in terms of the \n\noperational design and engineering concept, by two types of reservoirs: accumulation \n\n(storage) and run-of-river systems. The distinctiveness of reservoirs in terms of \n\ndimensions and functioning, accumulation and run-of-river systems, affects the \n\nphysical and chemical limnology of these environments (see Chapter 1) and also the \n\nstructure and dynamics of the aquatic communities (Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, \n\n2003; Nogueira et al., 2008; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2010; Nogueira et al. 2012; \n\nPerbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2013; Ferrareze et al., 2014). \n\nIn this study the zooplankton community of Paranapanema River reservoir \n\ncascade was composed of 112 taxa distributed among the main groups Rotifera (65), \n\nCopepoda (14) and Cladocera (33). These results are similar to the ones Sampaio et al. \n\n\n\n 131 \n \n\n(2002) that found by 108 taxa, Rotifera (76), Copepoda (7) and Cladocera (26). The \n\nsimilarities between both studies is also comparable in terms of the most frequent \n\nspecies. Although we found similarities in the composition and frequency, the species \n\nabundance and distributional patterns in each studied reservoir was quite variable \n\n(Sampaio et al., 2002). \n\nOther studies carried out in Paranapanema River reservoir cascade along the \n\nlast two decades, considering microcrustaceans (Copepoda and/or Cladocera) in the \n\nseries of reservoirs and/or reservoirs individually reveal a set of common species and \n\nsimilar frequency of occurrence (Panarelli et al., 2001; Nogueira, 2001; Casanova and \n\nHenry, 2004; Nogueira et al., 2008; Sartori et al., 2009; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, \n\n2010; Perbiche-Neves et al., 2016 and Nogueira and Naliato, 2016). This means that, in \n\nsome way, in this reservoirs system there is a reasonably well established zooplankton \n\ncommunity. \n\nSpecies composition in natural lakes lake, with a few exceptions, remains quite \n\nconstant for many decades, perhaps even centuries (Gannon and Stemberger, 1978) \n\nwhile reservoirs represent more complex and dynamics ecosystems, because of their \n\ninteractions with the watershed and the influx of tributaries (Stra\u0161kraba, 1997; \n\nStra\u0161kraba and Tundisi, 1999). Therefore, while in natural lakes plankton composition, \n\nspecies richness, and abundance of organisms are dependent on various factors such \n\nas lake origin, trophic state, colonization processes, and presence or absence of toxic \n\nsubstances or pollutants, in reservoirs the influence of spatial and temporal \n\nheterogeneity on plankton richness and diversity is even higher (Matsumura-Tundisi \n\nand Tundisi, 2005). \n\nThe high number of species in reservoirs and the reported variability can be \n\nrelated to distinct factors such as reservoir ageing, residence time, trophic state, \n\nbiological interactions, water basin endemism, and even to sampling designs and the \n\nexpertise of researchers (Matsumura-Tundisi, 1999; Rocha et al., 1999). \n\nIn our study the group of Rotifera, with the highest number of taxa (65) and \n\nnumerically dominant, had greater species richness in the middle to lower course of \n\nthe river - CII, CI, CP, TQ and RS reservoirs during the dry season. Cladocera showed \n\ngreater richness in the upper portion of the river - JR, CH and SG reservoirs in the both \n\nsampled seasons (wet and dry), and also in the middle course of the river - CII, CI, CP \n\n\n\n 132 \n \n\nand RS in the wet season. In terms of density, Rotifera showed highest values occurring \n\nin practically all reservoirs of the cascade, lower than Copepoda only in SG (dry \n\nseason), CP (wet and dry) and RS (wet season). Cladocera is a very important group in \n\nterms of species richness but its occurrence is always observed in low densities. \n\nThe zooplankton community density was higher in the accumulation reservoirs \n\n(storage system - JR, CH and CP), as expected (Nogueira et al., 2008). The relative \n\ndensity among groups showed the predominance of rotifers in the upper course of the \n\nriver in most sampled sites of JR, CH, SG during the wet and dry seasons. Conversely, \n\nthe predominance of copepods was observed in the middle and lower course of the \n\nriver - CII, CI, CP, TQ and RS. An increase of cladocerans occurred during the dry \n\nseason. \n\nThe diversity and evenness results have no recognized pattern of variation \n\nalong the reservoir cascade. Probably because of the intra reservoir variability, such as \n\nwater masses compartmentalization and tributaries influence, and their differential \n\neffects on different groups (Rotifera, Copepoda and Cladocera). \n\nDespite the great effort with the purpose of understanding the structure and \n\ndynamics of the zooplankton in Paranapanema River reservoir cascade (Panarelli et al., \n\n2001; Nogueira, 2001; Sampaio et al., 2002, Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003; \n\n2005; Casanova and Henry, 2004; Nogueira et al., 2008; Sartori et al., 2009; Perbiche-\n\nNeves and Nogueira, 2010; Perbiche-Neves et al., 2016), there are only few analyses \n\nthat includes the whole cascade, as a system, and all the main groups of zooplankton \n\ncommunity together. \n\nIn terms of regional zooplankton fauna, it is very important to consider the \n\nstudies of Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi (2003) on the composition and distribution \n\nof the Calanoida species in 21 reservoirs of S\u00e3o Paulo State by, carried out from 1979 \n\nonwards. Results show a considerable change in species composition. For instance, \n\nfrequent species such as Notodiaptomus conifer in the majority of the reservoirs of the \n\nMiddle Tiet\u00ea and Paranapanema River basins disappeared completely, being \n\nsubstituted by other ones. In case of Paranapanema River probably it was replaced by \n\nN. henseni, currently the most frequent, widely distributed and numerically more \n\nabundant. According to Gannon and Stemberger, (1978), perturbations that change \n\n\n\n 133 \n \n\nphysicochemical milieu or alter the balance of competition can cause extermination of \n\nsome species populations and allow the appearance of others. \n\nThe eutrophication of freshwaters causes great changes in the structure of \n\nzooplankton communities and one of the main difficulties in studying loss of \n\nbiodiversity due to eutrophication is the absence of previous records of species \n\ncomposition and/or misclassification of species, prior to eutrophication (Sampaio et \n\nal., 2002, Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003; 2005). In case of S\u00e3o Paulo State \n\nreservoirs, a pioneer typological study on 23 reservoirs during late 1970\u2019s established a \n\nbase line, comprising a seasonal study of their main physical, chemical and biological \n\ncharacteristics (Tundisi, 1981). \n\nIn the composition of the zooplankton community of the Paranapanema River \n\nreservoirs during the late 1970\u2019s, typical eutrophic bioindicators, such as Brachionus \n\ncalyciflorus, rarely occurred (Sampaio et al., 2002). Changes in community structure \n\nare expected during the process of eutrophication (Hellawell, 1978). In case of \n\nParanapanema reservoirs, the zooplankton is presently characterized by variation in \n\nthe proportions of the different species, but without any severe species replacement \n\nby tolerant forms. The accumulated information based on studies carried out in more \n\nthan three decades that clearly show the appearance, gradual and in low abundance, \n\nof trophic indicator species. \n\nThe results of the correlation and NMDS/SIMPER analyses (Table 2; Fig. 5, 6 and \n\n7) clearly indicated the potential of using the zooplankton as biondicators in the \n\nParanapanema River Basin. Nevertheless, results also indicated the need to find \n\nstatistically more consistency relationships. Perhaps this a problem that could be \n\nsolved if we increase our data set. In this sense, there is a good perspective through \n\nthe use of information from the ongoing long term monitoring program of the \n\nParanapanema River reservoir cascade. \n\nNevertheless, we also have to take into account the fact that reservoirs are \n\naquatic ecosystems subject to a set of conditions (human impacts, weather variability, \n\noperational engineering, etc.) which create a variety of transient situations affecting \n\nlimnological and biological features. The reservoir steady state is frequently disturbed \n\nand requires some time to reestablish (Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003). The \n\nphysical and chemical dynamics is intense and underlies a kind of organized chaos \n\n\n\n 134 \n \n\nwhich the biological components survive through adaptive strategies based on the \n\nmechanisms of species tolerance - capability to respond either to a certain \n\nenvironmental factor or to an assemblage that act synergistically on the organisms \n\n(Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003). \n\nAccording to Naselli-Flores et al. (2003), quite a number of ecological concepts \n\nhave been using terms such as ecological equilibrium, stability, steady-state, climax, \n\nstable state, etc. The term equilibrium was supposed to better depict the dynamic \n\nnature of a community when it is, or seems to be, persistent. Actually the persistency \n\nis only related to the temporal scale of the observer. The term stable state was \n\nproposed by Scheffer (1998) to describe the alternative stages in shallow lake \n\necosystems. The need for a clear definitions and the necessity for clarifying terms was \n\nopenly addressed in Rojo and \u00c1lvarez-Cobelas (2003). \n\nOccasionally, surprisingly large shifts occur in ecosystems. Theory suggests that \n\nsuch shifts can be attributed to alternative stable states and it implies that gradual \n\nchanges in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is \n\nreached at which a large shift occurs, which might be difficult to reverse (Scheffer and \n\nCarpenter, 2003). Even a tiny incremental change in certain conditions can trigger a \n\nlarge shift in some systems if a critical threshold known as \u2018catastrophic bifurcation\u2019 is \n\npassed (Kusnetsov, 1995). \n\nZooplankton is a valuable as indicators of water quality and trophic conditions \n\nthan has been under considered. It give us signs that the environment is undergoing \n\nchanges before these changes become drastic or irreparable. More attention must also \n\nbe given to eutrophication rate process so we can determine when natural rates are \n\nbeing accelerated by man\u2019s activities (Gannon and Stemberger, 1978). It is important \n\nto reinforce that this information is critically needed for wise management of aquatic \n\necosystems and indicator organisms may be useful not only for trophic state \n\nassessment but to reflect minor changes in water quality as well. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 135 \n \n\nReferences \n\nAndronikova, I.N. 1996.

We have analyzed the \n\nphytoplankton and zooplankton communities and determined the reservoirs\u2019 trophic \n\nstatus in the Paranapanema River. This is one of the main tributaries of the high \n\nParan\u00e1 River (La Plata basin) and is the natural border between the states of Paran\u00e1 \n\nand S\u00e3o Paulo, Southern Brazil. During the last half of twentieth century, eleven \n\nhydropower plants were constructed in the main course of the river. Three of the \n\nreservoirs are accumulation systems (i.e. high water retention times), whereas the \n\nothers are run-of-river dams. For the study the three larger reservoirs (Jurumirim, \n\nChavantes and Capivara) were selected. Physical, chemical and biological \n\n(phytoplankton and zooplankton) data were obtained in two sampling campaigns \n\ncarried out in March (wet season) and October (dry season) of 2011. For each reservoir \n\nwe sampled six stations, which were arranged in a gradient established between the \n\nlotic (Paranapanema River entrance) and lentic (dam) areas. According to the trophic \n\nstate index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr), the sampling stations were \n\ncategorized between ultraoligotrophic and mesotrophic, exhibiting low concentrations \n\nof phosphorus and chlorophyll. Four metrics achieved significant discrimination, in a \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\nset of twenty analyzed by discriminant analysis. The individual metric scores were \n\nsummed to provide a P-IBI score, which ranged as Mesotrophic (4-9), Oligotrophic (10-\n\n14) and Ultraoligotrophic (15-20) and corresponded with the classification of fair, good \n\nand excellent, respectively. Following the longitudinal sequence, Jurumirim was \n\nclassified as Oligotophic (qualitative category Good) and both Chavantes and Capivara \n\nas Ultraoligotrophyc (qualitative category Excellent). \n\nResumo \n\nDesenvolvemos e validamos um \u00cdndice Plankt\u00f4nico de Integridade Bi\u00f3tica (P-\n\nIBI) para reservat\u00f3rios subtropicais para avaliar a \u201csa\u00fade\u201d de seus ecossistemas. \n\nAnalisamos as comunidades fitoplanct\u00f4nica e zooplanct\u00f4nica e determinamos o \n\nestado tr\u00f3fico dos reservat\u00f3rios no rio Paranapanema. Este \u00e9 um dos principais \n\nafluentes do Alto Rio Paran\u00e1 (bacia do Prata) e \u00e9 fronteira natural entre os estados do \n\nParan\u00e1 e S\u00e3o Paulo, no sul do Brasil. Durante a \u00faltima metade do s\u00e9culo XX, onze \n\nusinas hidrel\u00e9tricas foram constru\u00eddas no curso principal do rio. Tr\u00eas dos reservat\u00f3rios \n\ns\u00e3o sistemas de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o (isto \u00e9, apresentam tempo de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua elevado), \n\nenquanto que os outros s\u00e3o do tipo fio d\u00b4\u00e1gua (baixo tempo de reten\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua). \n\nForam selecionados, neste estudo, os tr\u00eas maiores reservat\u00f3rios (Jurumirim, \n\nChavantes e Capivara). Os dados f\u00edsicos, qu\u00edmicos e biol\u00f3gicos (fitopl\u00e2ncton e \n\nzoopl\u00e2ncton) foram obtidos em duas campanhas de amostragem realizadas em mar\u00e7o \n\n(esta\u00e7\u00e3o chuvosa) e outubro (esta\u00e7\u00e3o seca) de 2011. Para cada reservat\u00f3rio foram \n\namostradas seis esta\u00e7\u00f5es, disposta em um gradiente estabelecido entre a regi\u00e3o l\u00f3tica \n\n(entrada do Rio Paranapanema) e l\u00eantica (barragem). De acordo com o \u00edndice de \n\nestado tr\u00f3fico para reservat\u00f3rios tropicais/subtropicais (TSItsr), as esta\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\namostragem foram categorizadas entre ultraoligotr\u00f3ficas e mesotr\u00f3ficas, \n\napresentando baixas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de f\u00f3sforo e clorofila a. Quatro m\u00e9tricas \n\nobtiveram discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o significativa, em um conjunto de vinte analisadas por an\u00e1lise \n\ndiscriminante. Os escores m\u00e9tricos individuais foram somados para fornecer uma \n\npontua\u00e7\u00e3o P-IBI, que variou como Mesotr\u00f3fico (4-9), Oligotr\u00f3fico (10-14) e \n\nUltraoligotr\u00f3fico (15-20) e correspondeu com a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de suficiente, boa e \n\nexcelente, respectivamente. Seguindo a sequ\u00eancia longitudinal, Jurumirim foi \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \n\nclassificado como Oligot\u00f3pico (categoria qualitativa Boa) e ambos Chavantes e \n\nCapivara como Ultraoligotr\u00f3fico (categoria qualitativa Excelente). \n\nIntroduction \n\nBrazil is a reservoir-orientated country, where most electricity production \n\ncomes from dammed rivers. According to The World Bank (2014), 32 countries, \n\nincluding Brazil, use hydropower to produce more than 80 % of their electricity \n\nrequirements. Further, at least 3,700 major dams, each one with a capacity of more \n\nthan 1 MW, are either planned or under construction in countries with emerging \n\neconomies (Zarfl et al., 2015).  \n\nThe construction of large reservoirs for hydropower generation during the last \n\ndecades is common all over the country (about 200 dams in operation and 200 under \n\nconstruction). These human-designed environments are particularly common in the \n\nSoutheast region, present in most rivers and have deeply changed the surrounding \n\nlandscapes. Besides the relatively clean and renewable energy production, additional \n\npositive aspects related to reservoirs are the strategic water storage, flood control, \n\nrecreation for local residents, tourism and other economic opportunities, such as \n\nfisheries and aquaculture (Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 2003). Among the negative \n\nimpacts it can be mentioned the considerable changes in the rivers\u2019 biota (Agostinho \n\net al., 2008; Nogueira et al., 2008; Nogueira et al. 2010).  \n\nStudies on reservoir limnology indicate that they constitute a particular class of \n\naquatic environment due to the dynamic interaction between riverine and lacustrine \n\ncompartments (Thornton et al., 1990; Armengol et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2003). \n\nThis distinctive pattern of spatial organization has been evidenced for several large \n\nBrazilian reservoirs (Nogueira et al., 1999; Pinto-Coelho et al., 2006; Soares et al., \n\n2008; Perbiche-Neves et al., 2011). The temporal and spatial complexity is even higher \n\nin the case of reservoir cascades. Despite some accumulated ecological information \n\n(Barbosa et al., 1999; Jorcin and Nogueira, 2005a, b; Nogueira et al., 2008; Naliato et \n\nal., 2009; Nogueira et al., 2010; Nogueira et al., 2012; Perbiche-Neves et al., 2011; \n\nMatsuura et al., 2015), research efforts are still necessary to understand the \n\nlimnological changes along the river continuum (Vannote et al., 1980), including the \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\nstructure and function after construction of series of dams - upstream and \n\ndownstream transference effects (i.e. downstream exportation of low oxygenated \n\nwater (deep located turbines), exportation of algae biomass, upstream nutrient and \n\nsolids retention, etc. (Matsuurra et al., 2015; Portinho et al., 2016). \n\nIntegrity of a given ecosystem can be assessed through the diagnosis of \n\nbiological attributes or indicators, which ideally are sensitive to a range of stresses, \n\nable to distinguish stress-induced variation from natural variation, relevant to society \n\nconcerns, and easy to measure and interpret. The complexity of biotic systems dictates \n\nthat integrity assessments should incorporate a variety of indicators (including \n\nelements and processes) from multiple organizational levels and spatiotemporal scales \n\n(Angermeier and Karr, 1994). \n\nThe Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) (Karr, 1981) is an ecologically based multi-\n\nmetric index for assessing the biological integrity of surface waters. It considered \n\ndistinct biotic attributes, ranging from individual to ecosystem-level properties. The IBI \n\nwas originally developed in the 1980s and used to assess fish assemblages as an \n\nindicator of aquatic ecosystem health (Karr, 1981; Karr et al., 1986). This tool has been \n\nadapted and modified in order to evaluate aquatic ecosystem health worldwide. A \n\nvariety of organisms have been used like littoral zone plants (Rothrock et al., 2008), \n\nbenthic macroinvertebrates (Fore et al., 1996, Li et al., 2010), aquatic insects (Silva et \n\nal., 2010), benthic diatom communities (Wu et al., 2012a), phytoplankton (G\u00f3mez et \n\nal., 2012; Wu et al., 2012b; Li et al., 2013), zooplankton (Carpenter et al., 2006) and \n\ncombined phyto- and zooplankton (Kane et al., 2009; Kane et al., 2015). IBIs have been \n\napplied to different aquatic environments such as rivers (Karr, 1981; Wu et al., 2012a; \n\nCassati et al., 2009; Esteves and Alexandre, 2011), estuaries (Carpenter et al., 2006; \n\nG\u00f3mez et al., 2012), lakes (Kane et al., 2009), reservoirs (Wu et al., 2012a) and \n\nreservoir cascades (Li et al., 2013) as well. \n\nAlthough IBIs have been used for many purposes, there is a unique study \n\nfocusing on the impact of cascading dams construction, which includes metrics related \n\nto phytoplankton assemblages (Li et al., 2013). The index values agreed with the \n\npattern of increased abundance and biomass of phytoplankton assemblages in \n\n\n\n142 \n\n \n\nreservoir areas and provided evidence of aquatic ecosystem degradation (as compared \n\nwith natural riverine stretches). \n\nAll components of reservoirs functioning can be influenced in major ways by \n\nthe dynamics of the phytoplankton and zooplankton once their abundances are \n\nrelated to nutrient/trophic status (i.e. total phosphorus and chlorophyll a \n\nconcentrations - eutrophic-oligotrophic gradients). Therefore, phytoplankton and \n\nzooplankton dynamics have a large impact on aquatic ecosystem and, as a \n\nconsequence, on humans who interact with these environments (Kane et al., 2009). \n\nWith the purpose of effectively assessing the ecosystem health of subtropical \n\nreservoirs, we developed and validated a Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) for \n\nthese systems, following Kane et al. (2009). The study is based on a reservoir cascade \n\nsystem located in Southern Brazil and includes metrics of the entire plankton \n\ncommunity \u2013 phyto and zooplankton. In contrast to traditional water quality \n\napproaches, the P-IBI is an aggregative indicator that can not only capture aquatic \n\ntrophic status but also identify variations in the aquatic ecosystems associated to the \n\nbiota. The development and application of a viable Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity \n\n(P-IBI) for subtropical reservoirs can be useful for management purposes \u2013 \n\nstakeholder\u2019s decision processes, improvement of monitoring protocols, and \n\nexpansion of scientific knowledge. \n\nFollowing Kane at al. (2009), our study included five goals: 1) to develop and \n\nimplement sampling protocols; 2) to develop a multimetric Planktonic Index of Biotic \n\nIntegrity (P-IBI) for subtropical reservoirs; 3) to validate the P-IBI for subtropical \n\nreservoirs statistically; 4) to apply the P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs using plankton \n\nselected data sets (2011 \u2013 March and October) from a Water Quality Monitoring \n\nProgram carried out in the Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade and 5) to \n\ndisseminate the results of the analyses to citizens and policy makers. \n\nMethods \n\nStudy area and site locations \n\nThe Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of the Paran\u00e1 River (La \n\nPlata basin), located between the coordinates 22\u00b0 - 26\u00b0 S and 47\u00b0 - 54\u00b0 W, on the \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\ntropical/subtropical boundary (Southeast/South Brazil). The river is the natural border \n\nbetween the states of Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo (Fig. 1), with a total length of 929 km. \n\nSince the 1950\u2019s, eleven hydropower plants have been constructed in the main river \n\ncourse. Three of the reservoirs are accumulation systems (i.e. with high water \n\nretention times), whereas the others are run-of-the-river systems. For this study the \n\nthree larger storage (accumulation) reservoirs (Jurumirim, Chavantes and Capivara) \n\nwere selected, based on the criteria that they are more lake like which allows \n\nsuccession of plankton assemblages. These three reservoirs have high shoreline \n\ndevelopment (> 15), high retention time (> 150 days), and are relatively deep (> 30 m \n\nnear to the dam) (Table 1). \n\nFor each reservoir we considered six sampling stations including the main \n\nspatial compartments identified from previous studies (Nogueira et al., 1999; 2012), \n\nwhich are arranged in a gradient established between the lotic (Paranapanema River \n\nentrance) and lentic (dam) areas (Fig. 1). \n\n\n\n144 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Geographic location of Paranapanema River showing the entire eleven reservoirs cascade and the selected ones highlighted with \nsampling sites. \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Samples for total phosphorus were previously digested (Valderrama, 1981) \n\nand then anlyzed spectrophotometrically (Strickland and Parsons, 1960). Total \n\nchlorophyll a concentration was determined in replicates after vacuum filtration \n\n(Millipore AP40 membranes) of 1 L of water from each considered depth. For pigments \n\nextraction it was used cold acetone (90%) after manual maceration were used (Talling \n\nand Driver, 1963; Golterman et al., 1978). \n\nThe trophic state index was determined according to Cunha et al. (2013) for \n\ntropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr), which consider six categories: (U) \n\nUltraoligotrophic (?51.1), (O) Oligotrophic (51.2 -53.1), (M) Mesotrophic (53.2-55.7), \n\n(E) Eutrophic (55.8-58.1), (S) Supereutrophic (58.2-59) and (H) Hypereutrophic (? 59.1). \n\nFor both, TP and Chl a, average values among depths of each sampling station was \n\nused to calculate the trophic state index. \n\n  \n\n\n\n146 \n\n \n\nPhytoplankton and Zooplankton samples \n\nFor phytoplankton, at each sampling station, an integrated sample was \n\ncollected (entire water column) through vertical net hauls (20 ?m of mesh size) and \n\nimmediately preserved in 4% formalin. The net samples were observed in an optical \n\nmicroscope (maximum magnification of 1000\u00d7) for taxonomical identification and \n\ndetermination of assemblage total richness. For phytoplankton quantitative analysis, \n\nthree unfiltered samples were collected (van Dorn bottle) at the subsurface (ca. 0.2 m), \n\nmiddle of the water column and near to the bottom (ca. 1 m above the sediment). The \n\nsamples were fixed and preserved with Lugol\u2019s solution. After sedimentation, the \n\norganisms (cell, colony, and filament) were counted using inverted microscopy (sensu \n\nUterm\u00f6hl) at a magnification of 400\u00d7. At least 120 optical fields distributed in parallel \n\ntransects were examined, and at least 150 organisms were counted per sample. The \n\nquantitative data were expressed as mean values for the water column. \n\nThe zooplankton samples were collected using a conical net (30 cm mouth \n\ndiameter and 50 ?m mesh size) and vertical hauls from near bottom (ca. 1 m) to the \n\nsurface. In each site/campaign an additional sample for qualitative analysis was \n\ncollected. Samples were fixed and preserved in 4 % formaldehyde. For the quantitative \n\nanalyses, most organisms were counted at species level using sub-samples. Rotifera, \n\nand nauplii of Copepoda were counted in Sedgwick\u2013Rafter chambers, by optic \n\nmicroscope Zeiss Standard 25 (at a magnification of \u00d7 200); and Cladocera, \n\ncopepodites and adult stages of Copepoda were counted using a stereo microscope \n\nZeiss Stemi SV 6 (maximum magnification of \u00d7 120). At least 150 specimens were \n\ncounted per subsample. Additional sub-samples, or even the entire sample, were \n\nanalyzed when the density of organisms was low (generally less than 100 organisms \n\nper 5 ml of sample, in case of Cladocera and Copepoda, and less than 100 organisms \n\nper 1 ml of sample, in case of Rotifera). \n\n  \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\nDeveloping a planktonic index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) for subtropical reservoirs \n\nMetric selection and statistical validation \n\nA number of plankton characteristics are directly related to the assemblage\u2019s \n\nstructure and composition and reflect the status of a range of environment attributes. \n\nIt is well known from scientific studies carried on along more than a century worldwide \n\nthat plankton features are susceptible to anthropogenic influences and can indicated \n\ndistinct levels of eutrophication. Based on previous experience on developing the P-IBI \n\n(Kane et al., 2009) as well as on the accumulated regional knowledge (e.g. Nogueira et \n\nal., 2008; Nogueira et al., 2009; Perbiche et al., 2011; Perbiche et al., 2016) 20 \n\ncandidate metrics were considered and included in the discriminant analysis to be \n\nused for the multimetric index for tropical and subtropical reservoirs: total calanoid \n\ndensity; total cyclopoid density; total cladocera density; total rotifer density; total \n\ncrustacean density; zooplankton ratio calanoid/cladocera + cyclopoid; zooplankton \n\nratio calanoid/cyclopoid; zooplankton richness; zooplankton diversity; zooplankton \n\nequitability; total phytoplankton density; % cyanobacteria; abundance of the most \n\ncommon Cyanobacteria genera Anabaena (Dolichospermum), Aphanizomenon, and \n\nMicrocystis; % of Anabaena (Dolichospermum), Aphanizomenon and Microcystis; \n\nedible phytoplankton density; inedible phytoplankton density; abundance of the \n\ninvasive species Ceratium cf. furcoides; phytoplankton richness; phytoplankton \n\ndiversity and phytoplankton equitability. \n\nTotal phosphorus concentrations (\u00b5g L\n-1\n\n), and total chlorophyll a concentrations \n\n(\u00b5g L\n-1\n\n) were used to classify the sites trophic status (from ultraoligotrophic to \n\nhypereutrophyc as proposed by Cunha et al., 2013). \n\nDiscriminant analysis (DA) was used to evaluate the ability of plankton metrics \n\nto distinguish among levels of degradation. DA discriminates among pre-specified \n\ngroups of samples based on a set of variables to find gradients among groups of \n\nsamples, then variation among groups is maximized, while within group variation is \n\nminimized (McGarigal et al., 2000). Discriminant analysis has been identified as an \n\nacceptable statistical method for the development of Indices of Biotic Integrity and can \n\nbe used to identify variables that discriminate between levels of degradation (USEPA, \n\n\n\n148 \n\n \n\n1998). We performed discriminant analyses (Statistica, version 7.0) to give a broad \n\nrange of conditions in both trophic status and in the candidate metrics. All 20 metrics \n\nand sites were included in the discriminant analysis. \n\nFour out 20 metrics were selected on through the discriminant analysis. In \n\norder to calculate individual metric scores we constructed \u2018\u2018boxplots\u2019\u2019 of the significant \n\nindividual plankton metrics frequency distributions. We used the 95th percentile as the \n\nupper boundary and zero as the lower boundary (Karr et al., 1996) and trisected each \n\nof the final individual metrics included in the multimetric P-IBI for subtropical \n\nreservoirs (based on significance in the discriminant analyses) into ranges that were \n\nassigned a score of 1, 3, or 5 to match those values assigned to the trophic status \n\ncondition. A 5, represented the better environmental condition (ultraoligotrophic) \n\nrange of trisection, while a 1, was the most degraded (mesotrophic) range of the \n\ntrisection. The statistically significant metrics for each site were summed to provide a \n\nP-IBI score and a classification applicable for subtropical reservoirs, in this case, \n\nranging from fair to excellent, or Mesotrophic (4-9), Oligotrophic (10-14) and \n\nUltraoligotrophic (15-20), respectively. \n\nWe performed two steps to calculate the P-IBI: 1) Use cutoff scores for each \n\nvariable to calculate individual metric values and 2) Estimate a subtropical reservoir \n\nmean metric score. \n\nP-IBI was computed through: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere: CAijk= Total Calanoid density metric score; Cyijk= Total Cyclopoid density \n\nmetric score; PRijk= Phytoplankton richness metric score; PDijk= Phytoplankton diversity \n\nmetric score; M = number of metrics; S = number of sites and R = number of reservoirs. \n\nFinally, a weighted Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistic (k) (Cohen, 1960) was calculated in \n\norder to judge the accuracy of classification. Cohen\u2019s Kappa is a statistical measure of \n\nthe agreement of two raters or two rating methods. In our case, we compared the \n\ntrophic status determined by TSItsr and the developed P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs. \n\nSignificance for the weighted Cohen\u2019s Kappa was judge ?=0.05 or hypothesis testing. A \n\nP ? IBI =\n1\n\nR\n  ?\n\nR\n\nk=1\n\n1\n\nS\n ?\n\nS\n\nj=1\n\n1\n\nM\n ?\n\nM\n\ni=1\n\n CAijk + CYijk + PRijk\n\n+ PDijk  \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\nCohen\u2019s Kappa of 1 indicates perfect agreement between the raters and 0 indicates \n\nthat any agreement is totally due to chance. There is no clear-cut agreement on what \n\nconstitutes good or poor levels of agreement, although a common set of criteria is: \n\n<0,00 = poor, 0,00-0,20 = slight, 0,21-0,40 = fair, 0,41-0,60 = moderate, 0,61-0,80 = \n\nsubstantial, 0,81-1,00 almost perfect (Landis and Kock, 1977). \n\n  \n\n\n\n150 \n\n \n\nComunication \n\nAn important goal of IBI development is to communicate the biotic integrity \n\nresults to a variety of different groups of stakeholders (Karr and Chu, 1997). This group \n\nranges from scientists and managers to citizens and policy makers who all have a stake \n\non management of lakes/reservoirs water quality. \n\nFurther, we graphed the data as simple bar plots of P-IBI scores and also \n\ndetermined qualitative categories of the P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs that reflect the \n\nlevel of degradation scoring system (i.e., poor, fair, good, excellent) and are effective \n\nfor summarizing reservoirs biological integrity. \n\nResults \n\nReservoirs trophic state condition and plankton richness \n\nThe selected Paranapanema River reservoirs exhibited low or relatively low \n\nconcentrations of TP (varying from 3,1 \u00b5g L\n-1 \n\nin Jurumirim to 67,2 \u00b5g L\n-1\n\n in Capivara) \n\nand Chl a (varying from 0,4 \u00b5g L\n-1\n\n in Chavantes to 7,0 \u00b5g L\n-1\n\n in Capivara) (Fig. 2). The \n\nobserved concentrations limited the range used on developing P-IBI from \n\nultraoligotrophic to mesotrophic status (Table 2), restricting the final classification \n\nfrom fair to excellent. \n\nThe plankton community richness seems to correspond to the trophic \n\nconditions of the selected reservoirs. In general, phytoplankton richness ranged \n\nbetween 116 (Chavantes) and 147 species (Jurumirim) in March, and between 112 and \n\n137 species in October, also in Chavantes and Jurumirim, respectively. Zooplankton \n\nwas represented by Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepod and the highest richness was \n\nfound in Jurumirim (58 species) in October and the lowest was in Chavantes (34 \n\nspecies) also in October. The total richness (number of taxa) for phytoplankton during \n\nthe entire period was 176 in Jurumirim, 158 in Chavantes and 180 in Capivara and for \n\nzooplankton it was 68 in Jurumirim, 58 in Chavantes and 64 in Capivara. \n\n \n\n\n\n151 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Total Phosphorus and Total Chlorophyll a concentrations in the cascade \nreservoir of the Paranapanema River during the study period. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n152 \n\n \n\nTable 2.

These results fairly represent the values obtained through the Trophic State \n\nIndex for tropical/subtropical reservoirs as presented in Table 2. There is also a good \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \n\ncorrespondence with the classification proposed by the P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs, \n\nwith scores ranging from Good in Jurumirim reservoir and Excellent in the Chavantes \n\nand Capivara reservoirs. \n\nFigure 3 (B to D) shows the P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs for each one of the \n\nselected reservoirs and sampling sites.

These reservoirs are considered as strategic for the \n\nenvironmental policy of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, the most populous and industrialized in \n\nthe country where deterioration of inland waters resources is critical. \n\nThe Paranapanena River has been considered as a fluvial system that preserves \n\na relatively good \u201cwater quality\u201d condition, with frequent classification of its reservoirs \n\nas oligotrophic or oligo-mesotrophic (Jorcin and Nogueira 2005a, b; Nogueira et al., \n\n2008; Jorcin and Nogueira, 2009; Nogueira et al., 2010; Henry, 2014).  \n\nThe use of plankton assemblages as integrative indexes for assessment of \n\nregional environmental variability is promising. Studies carried on along the \n\nParanapanema River reservoir cascade have shown that phytoplankton and \n\nzooplankton abundances are positively associated along the cascade. It has also been \n\ndemonstrated that their composition and structure, even in major taxonomical \n\ncategories, can be good indicators of distinct trophic conditions in the reservoirs \n\ncascade (Nogueira et al., 2008, Sartori et al., 2009; Nogueira et al., 2010; Perbiche-\n\nNeves and Nogueira 2010). \n\n\n\n155 \n\n \n\nThe determination of the trophic state index (TSI) is a traditional approach for \n\nevaluation of the water quality in freshwater systems. The TSI based on limnological \n\nvariables that are relatively simple to measure, easy to calculate, and simple to \n\nunderstand and explain. In our study we adopted the regional proposal of Cunha et al. \n\n(2013) for tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr), which is a modified version of the \n\noriginal Carlson TSI (1997). Despite the fact that the TSIsr proposes the use of annual \n\ngeometric mean based on 4 seasonal samplings (we have 2) and is recommended for \n\nlacustrine conditions (we have also sampled the upstream zones of reservoirs \u2013 river-\n\nreservoir transition), this index allows for comparison with the P-IBI in the case \n\nsubtropical reservoirs. Further, our sampling limitations can be overcome in the future, \n\nas additional data have been and will be collected under the auspices of the \n\nhydropower generation company. \n\nThe following considerations helps to justify the choose of TSItsr in our study: \n\n(i) the trophic state criterion may help the decision making process when managing \n\nreservoir eutrophication and estimating the risk of phytoplankton blooms; (ii) trophic \n\nstate criteria developed for temperate systems may overestimate the enrichment \n\ncondition of tropical/subtropical reservoirs; (iii) comparison with previous \n\ninvestigations (e.g. Lamparelli, 2004) and with the official monitoring protocol of the \n\nenvironment agency of S\u00e3o Paulo State (iv) the use of the TSItsr in other studies has \n\nbeen encouraged, based on the perspective that is more representative for \n\ntropical/subtropical freshwaters (Cunha et al., 2013). \n\nThe spectrum of variation resulting from the TSItsr for the selected \n\nParanapanema River reservoirs was relatively low. The classification varied between \n\nultraoligotrophic and mesotrophic, with the prevalence of the first condition (Table 2). \n\nThese results are in accordance with other studies carried this watershed (see above), \n\nand also with the P-IBI we have developed. In our study the reservoir scores (mean \n\nvalues) were very close and comprised the categories meotrophic, oligotrophic and \n\nultraoligotrophic and the reservoirs were classified either as ultraoligotrophic or \n\noligotrophic (qualitative categories Excellent or Good) (Figure 3). \n\nThe agreement between the two considered methodological approaches, TSItsr \n\nand the developed P-IBI, was slight (Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistic) (Table 3). This fact is \n\n\n\n156 \n\n \n\nprobably because of the low number of samples collected in a single year. \n\nNevertheless, there is a feasible possibility to enhance the P-IBI consistency in further \n\nanalyses, as systematic monitoring of Jurumirm, Chavantes and Capivara reservoir \n\ncontinue. \n\nPrevious to our study, the phytoplankton IBI was developed for a reservoir \n\ncascade in the Lancang-Mekong River, Southwest China (Li et al. 2013). The index was \n\ndeveloped using phytoplankton metrics (but not zooplankton metrics) and the results \n\ncorroborated the known longitudinal spatial pattern. Variability was mainly related to \n\nincreasing abundance and biomass of phytoplankton assemblages in reservoir areas. \n\nDespite using data of only two sampling periods, it is important to consider that \n\nthe selected periods (March and October 2011) are representative of the regional \n\nenvironmental variability, as they correspond to the most contrasting seasonal periods \n\n- end of summer/rainy season and end of winter/dry season, respectively. The type of \n\ndata used to develop our P-IBI is comparable with those of Kane et al., (2009) and \n\nother authors who developed IBI\u2019s (i.e. Carpenter et al., (2006), Rothrock et al., (2008), \n\nCassati et al., (2009), Li et al., (2010), Silva et al., (2010), Esteves and Alexandre, (2011), \n\nG\u00f3mez et al., (2012), Wu et al., (2012a), Wu et al., (2012b), Ruaro et al., (2013), Li et \n\nal., (2013), Kane et al., (2015)). \n\nMultimetric indices have been criticized because they reduce data into a single \n\nnumber (Wu et al., 2012b). However, agreeing with Ruaro et al. (2013), we believe that \n\nan integrative and simple index may be a fast and efficient tool to monitor aquatic \n\nenvironments. The advantages of using a multimetric system over a univariate \n\nassessment include: (1) they measure different responses to multi-stressors occurring \n\nwithin the region of interest, since metrics represent various taxonomic and functional \n\ngroups within the assemblages (biotic integrity) (Zalack et al., 2010); (2) they compare \n\nhabitats both within and among regions (Barbour et al., 1999), and (3) they \n\ncompensate for erratic responses of a few metrics, and (4) they incorporate metrics \n\nrelated to multiple ecological attributes that are valued by decision makers (Wang et \n\nal., 2005). \n\nMoreover, the ideas proposed by Karr (1981) have contributed to the \n\nmanagement of water resources and biological conservation (Ruaro et al., 2013). The \n\n\n\n157 \n\n \n\noriginal Karr IBI is one of the most frequently used and one of the most efficient in the \n\nassessment of freshwater ecosystems integrity. It allows the identification of priority \n\nsites for conservation (Lyons et al., 1995), integrates measurements of biological \n\ncondition and associated resources that are easily understood by public and official \n\nagencies, and allows the comparison of both individual and cumulative effects of a \n\nvariety of human activities (Karr and Chu, 2000). \n\nFinal considerations \n\nThis study demonstrated that the P-IBI is a potential tool for monitoring and \n\nmanagement of large subtropical reservoirs, and reflects differences in ecosystem \n\nhealth over space and time. The use of metrics associated with plankton assemblages \n\nis appropriated, once the organisms are sensitive to environmental changes and \n\nintegrates distinct time and space scales. \n\nP-IBI scores can be understood and used by nonscientists involved in the \n\nmaking, planning, and management decisions at an appropriate level for the multiple \n\nuses of subtropical reservoirs. This P-IBI generally agrees with previous evaluations of \n\nthe study reservoirs and can be easily integrated into the water quality monitoring \n\nprogram of the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade. \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors would like to thank CAPES Foundation for the first author financial support \n\n(PDSE fellowship proc.002422/2015-08), Defiance College, and Dr. Robert Michael McKay \n\n(BGSU) for an international internship opportunity and access to the studies in which this \n\narticle was based on.
