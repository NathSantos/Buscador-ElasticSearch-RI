Three sites (spaced 50 m apart) were \nselected. Three transects were anchored at each site, spaced equidistantly 2 m apart. Each transect \nextended from the base of the primary dunes to the inner surf zone at approximately 1m in depth, \nwith between 7 and 8 sampling levels. Monthly, with a 20 cm diameter core, one biological sample \nwas collected per transect at each level, a total of nine samples  per level. Within transects, the \ndistance between the levels was 20 m until the upper swash zone, from which the distance was 10 m \nuntil the 1-meter isobath. Zonation proved to be variable throughout the year. Variability was mainly \na reflection of the greater instability of the lower part of the beach, which comprised the lower \nmesolittoral zone and the inner surf zone. This was evidenced seasonally with the formation of \ndistinct groups of fauna in accordance with the peculiarity of each season of the year. The formation \nof these groups was strongly influenced by fluctuations in densities stemming from recruitments and \nthe migration of juvenile and adult infauna, as well as superimposing of the distribution of organisms \nas a result of rises in sea level due to storms.  \n \n\nRESUMO \n \nA zona\u00e7\u00e3o da macrofauna bent\u00f4nica na praia do Cassino, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil, foi estudada \ndurante um ano (junho 2004 a maio de 2005) com base em coletas mensais. Para isso escolheu-se 3 \nlocais, com 50 m de dist\u00e2ncia um do outro, sendo que em cada local foram fundeadas 3 transversais 2 \nm eq\u00fcidistantes. Cada transversal se estendeu desde a base das dunas prim\u00e1rias at\u00e9 aproximadamente \n1m de profundidade no infralitoral, sendo 7 a 8 n\u00edveis de coleta distribu\u00eddos em cada uma das \ntransversais. Mensalmente, utilizando-se um tubo extrator de 20 cm de di\u00e2metro, coletou-se uma \namostra biol\u00f3gica por transversal em cada n\u00edvel, totalizando nove amostras por n\u00edvel. A dist\u00e2ncia dos \nn\u00edveis de coleta em cada transversal foi de 20 m at\u00e9 o limite superior da zona de varrido, a partir da \nqual a dist\u00e2ncia foi de 10 m. A zona\u00e7\u00e3o mostrou-se vari\u00e1vel ao longo do ano, sendo que esta \nvariabilidade refletiu, principalmente, a maior instabilidade da zona inferior da praia, que \ncompreendeu o mesolitoral inferior e a zona de arrebenta\u00e7\u00e3o interna. Isto ficou evidenciado \nsazonalmente, com a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de distintos grupos faun\u00edsticos de acordo com a peculiaridade de cada \nesta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano. A forma\u00e7\u00e3o destes grupos foi fortemente influenciada pelas flutua\u00e7\u00f5es das \ndensidades, decorrentes dos recrutamentos e migra\u00e7\u00f5es de juvenis e adultos da infauna, e da \nsobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos organismos, em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua devido \u00e0s \nressacas. \nDescriptors: Sandy beaches; Benthic macrofauna; Zonation; Cassino Beach. \nDescritores: Praias arenosas; Macrofauna bent\u00f4nica; Zona\u00e7\u00e3o; Praia do Cassino. \n\n \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \n\nBeaches are dynamic environments where \nelements such as wind, water and sand interact, \nresulting in complex hydrodynamic and depositional \nprocesses (BROWN; MCLACHLAN, 1990). The \npeculiar demands or tolerations of each species to \ndifferent ecological factors result in a vertical \ndistribution of organisms in characteristic zones, \nwhich is known as zonation.  \n\nDespite the difficulty in identifying zonation \non sandy beaches, some schemes have been proposed. \nBased on the distribution of crustaceans, Dahl (1952) \nproposed a universal division into three zones. Salvat \n(1964) proposed a zonation scheme that divides \nbeaches into four zones (dry sand, retention, \nresurgence  and  saturation  zones)  based  on  physical \nfactors. In spite of these and other proposals, \ncontroversy remains regarding the validity of zonation \ndefinition schemes on sandy beaches (RAFFAELLI et \nal., 1991). \n\n\n\n \n\nIt has been verified that the zonation pattern \nof macrofauna changes according to the type of beach, \nand the number of zones increases from reflective \nbeaches to dissipative beaches (DEFEO et al., 1992a; \nJARAMILLO et al., 1993). \n\nAn analysis of macrofauna in the \nmesolittoral zone of 15 beaches in the state of Rio de \nJaneiro (Brazil) indicated more than one zonation \nscheme. There was the recognition of two or three \nbiological zones, and reflective beaches presented a \nmore stable pattern of two zones (VELOSO et al., \n2003).  \n\nIn a study carried out on a sandy beach in the \nstate of Paran\u00e1 (Brazil), a persistent pattern of four \nfauna zones was recorded throughout the year \n(SOUZA; GIANUCA, 1995). Also in Paran\u00e1, a study \nanalyzing the influence of morphodynamics on the \nbenthic community of 10 beaches recognized 4 fauna \nzones following the scheme proposed by Salvat (1964) \n(BORZONE et al., 1996). Borzone and Souza (1997) \nverified that macrofauna zonation adjusted to the \nSalvat (1964) scheme, but evidenced temporal \nvariations in zonation patterns, which were more \nrelated to the stability of the sediment than tide levels. \nBased on data from six beaches, Barros et al. (2001) \ndemonstrated that the macrofauna zonation pattern \nwas better adjusted to the Salvat (1964) scheme, with a \nsmall difference between the winter and summer \nresults.  \n\nThe Uruguayan coast on the border of the \nstate of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) biogeographically \nconstitutes what is known  as the Riogrande-\nUruguayan Sector, due to the similarity in the fauna \ncomposition of sandy beaches (ESCOFET et al., \n1979). A one-year accompaniment of macrofauna \nzonation at Barra del Chuy (Uruguay) indicated the \nexistence of three zones between the supralittoral zone \nand the lower levels of the swash zone (BRAZEIRO; \nDEFEO, 1996). However, the authors identified an \nimportant variation in the zonation of organisms \nthroughout the seasons of the year, which reinforces \nthe need for temporal follow-ups of the benthic \nmacrofauna in the Riogrande-Uruguayan Sector.    \n\nOn the northern coast of the state of Rio \nGrande do Sul (Brazil), daily accompaniment (for five \ndays) of benthic macrofauna zonation between the mid \nmesolittoral zone and the beginning of the surf zone \non three sandy beaches, distinguished only two fauna \nzones (NEVES; BEMVENUTI, 2006). Despite work \ncarried out regarding the composition and distribution \nof benthic macrofauna on beaches along the southern \ncoast of Rio Grande do Sul (GIANUCA, 1983, 1987; \nBORZONE; GIANUCA, 1990), there is a lack of \napproaches regarding quantitative sampling with \nreplication between the supralittoral zone and the \nlower bounds of the swash zone. The aim of the \npresent study was to determine the vertical distribution \n\nof benthic macrofauna during the four seasons of the \nyear on a sandy beach on the southern coast of Rio \nGrande do Sul. \n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n\nStudy Area \n \n\nThe sandy beaches of southernmost Brazil \nare exposed, with a slight decline, fine sand, moderate \nto strong wave action and well-developed surf zone, \npresenting dissipative to intermediate morphodynamic \nstates (GIANUCA, 1988; GARCIA; GIANUCA, \n1998; BORZONE; GIANUCA, 1990). The \nastronomical tides are insignificant, and \nmeteorological factors are the main cause of variations \nin water level (CALLIARI;  KLEIN, 1993).  \n\nCassino Beach, Rio Grande (RS) presents \ndissipative characteristics in the area near the jetties of \nBarra de Rio Grande, whereas 17.2 km southwards of \nthe western jetty (052\u00ba 14\u2019 040 W and 32\u00ba 15\u2019 554 S) \n(Fig. 1), intermediate characteristics were observed \n(CALLIARI; KLEIN, 1993; PEREIRA, 2005).  \n For the zonation denomination, the \nnomenclature proposed by Gianuca (1998) for Cassino \nbeach was used. The supralittoral level is a zone under \nthe effect of sea spray, which is only inundated by the \nocean during extreme events, such as tides of storms. \nThe mesolittoral corresponds to the zone inundated by \nthe tides, with the swash zone in its lower bounds, \nwhich is subjected to the swash and backwash of \nwaves. The upper bounds of the infralittoral was \ndenominated the inner surf zone, which is \ncharacterized by shallow sandy bottoms and turbulent \nbetween the lower swash zone and approximately 2 m \nin depth.  \n \n\nSampling \n \n\nThe sampling of benthic macrofauna was \nperformed monthly for a period of 12 months (June \n2004 to May 2005). Three sites were selected at a \ndistance of 50 m from each other. At each site, 3 \ntransects were demarked, 2 m equidistant from one \nanother. Each transect extended from the base of the \nprimary dunes to the inner surf zone at approximately \n1 m depth, with between 7 and 8 collection levels.  \nMonthly one biological sample was  collected per \ntransect at each level, a  total of  nine samples per \nlevel.  Within transects, the distance between the \nlevels was 20 m until the upper swash zone, from \nwhich distance was 10 m until the 1-meter isobath \n(Fig. 1). The smaller distance between levels on the \nlower parts of the beach was due to the greater number \nof species and organisms that tend to concentrate in \nthis area (GIANUCA, 1983). \n\nBiological samples were collected using a \ncore  of  20  cm  diameter  (0.031416 m2), sunk into \nthe  sediment  to  a  depth  of  20  cm,  as  most  of  the  \n\n294                                                    BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY, 55(4), 2007 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 1. Location of study area and sampling design from which the benthic \nmacrofauna was collected. \n\n \nmacrofauna abundance is found in the first 15-20 cm \nof depth in the sediment (BALLY, 1983). Samples \nwere sieved with a nylon mesh with a 0.5 mm pore \nopening, and the material collected was fixed in a 10 \n% formaldehyde solution. In the laboratory, organisms \nwere quantified and identified to the smallest possible \ntaxonomic level under a stereoscopic microscope. \n\nA monthly quantification was also \nperformed on the number of Ghost Crab burrows \n(Ocypode quadrata), which were mainly located in the \nsupralittoral zone. The method utilized to quantify the \ndensity of O. quadrata through the number of burrows \nwas also used by Neves and Bemvenuti (2006) and \nAlberto and Fontoura (1999) in works carried out on \n\nthe coast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Starting \nfrom the bases of the primary dunes, 100 m lines \nparallel to the beach were established. These lines \nwere anchored in the area of occurrence of the O. \nquadrata burrows at a distance of 5 m from one \nanother. Through the continuous arrangement of 1x1m \ngrid, the density of burrows along each line was \nrecorded.  \n\nRegarding the bivalve Mesodesma \nmactroides,  organisms  with a shell  length  between 1 \nand 10 mm were defined as recruits; those with 10.1 \u2013 \n42.9 mm were defined as juveniles; and as adults, \nthose with a shell length greater than 43 mm, \n\n                         NEVES ET AL.: ZONATION OF BENTHIC MACROFAUNA ON CASSINO BEACH                          295\n\n\n\n \n\naccording to the procedure proposed by Masello and \nDefeo (1986) and Defeo et al. (1992b). Recruits, \njuveniles and adults of the bivalve Donax hanleyanus \nwere defined respectively as organisms of 1-5 mm, \n5.5-15 mm and >15 mm in length, following Defeo \nand de Alava (1995). \n\nFor the analysis of the spatial variation of the \nbenthic macrofauna, samples pertaining to each level \nat each site were totaled on a monthly basis. \n\n \nEnvironmental Data \n\n \nSeasonal sediment samples were taken at \n\neach of the levels of the 3 sites. The grain size analysis \nof sediment were performed through the proportions \nof sand, silt and clay in the sediment were determined \nthrough sieving (> 0.062 mm in diameter) and \npipetting (&lt;0.062 mm in diameter), following \nprocedures described by Suguio (1973). During the \nmonthly sampling, wave height (visual observations), \naverage wave period (digital chronometer) and salinity \n(optical refractometer) were recorded, along with air \nand water temperatures Using a fixed reference, the \nmonthly topographic profile of the beach was obtained \nfor the central transversal at Site 2. For such, a dumpy \nlevel was used. Hourly data on wind speed and \ndirection were provided by the Barra de Rio Grande \nPilotage Authority.  \n\nTo characterize the seasonal \nmorphodynamics state of the beach, the Dean\u2019s \ndimensionless parameter (?=Hb/Ws.T) was \nemployed, where Hb is the wave height of the surf, Ws \nis the rate of sediment decantation and T is the wave \nperiod.  The ? values less than 1 represent reflective \nbeaches; intermediate beaches are classified within the \n1 to 6 interval; and dissipative beaches present ? \nvalues greater than 6 (SHORT; WRIGHT, 1983). \n \n\nStatistical Analyses \n \n\nIn order to analyze the zonation and possible \nvariations of the benthic macrofauna distribution \nthroughout the year, statistical analyses were \nperformed on the PRIMER v5 program (Plymouth \nRoutines in  Multi Ecological Research) using \nquantitative data (CLARKE; WARWICK, 1994). For \nthe multivariate analyses, the sum of the samples of \neach level, for site, was used to draw up a similarity \nspreadsheet (Q mode) using the Bray-Curtis \ndissimilarity index. The spring and summer data and \nthe annual total were transformed into ?? due to the \nconsiderable difference in the density of individuals \n(CLARKE;  GREEN, 1988). Multi-Dimensional \nScaling (MDS) analysis was then performed to find \nthe groups. This analysis is considered the most robust \nto verify the benthic macrofauna zonation on sandy \nbeaches (KENKEL; ORLOCI, 1986; RAFFAELLI et \nal., 1991). The difference between groups was tested \nthrough the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), at a \n\nsignificance level of p<5% and R statistic > 0.5. \nSimilarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) was used for \nthe determination of dissimilarity between the groups \nformed and to verify the contribution of the principal \nspecies in the groups formation. Levels 1 and 2 \n(supralittoral) were not considered in the multivariate \nanalyses, as they presented only benthic macro-\ninvertebrates originating from the stranding, i.e. \norganisms that were flung to these levels by storms. \nThe vast majority of them were dead at the time of \nsampling.   \n\nThe Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H\u2019) \nand the Peilou evenness index (J') were also \ndetermined for each level. \n\n \nRESULTS \n\n \nEnvironmental Variables \n\n \n Minimum salinity was recorded during the \nJuly  sampling (29 \u2030)  and  maximums  in January \n(36 \u2030) and March (36 \u2030). Water temperature of the \ninner surf zone followed the same tendency as air \ntemperature, with minimums recorded in July (water = \n14\u00baC and air = 15\u00baC) and May (water = 13.5\u00baC and air \n= 15\u00baC), and the maximum in January (water = 26\u00baC \nand air = 30\u00baC). Wave height presented higher values \nin November (1.5 m) and July (1 m), whereas the \naverage wave period ranged from 8 to 11.9 sec. \nAverage declivity of the beach was 1.7\u00ba throughout the \nsampling period. \n\nFrom the ? values, it was determined that \nthe beach studied presented an intermediate stage \nthroughout the four seasons of the year (Table 1). The \nsediment type for most of the area was classified as \nfine sand, but on some occasions medium sand \npredominated on the lower part of the beach (Table 1). \nThe beach presented constant erosion and accretion \nthroughout the year, but the profiles that composed the \nsummer were more stable (Fig. 2). \n\nDuring the 7 days prior to sampling of the \nbenthic macrofauna, NE wind was the most frequent, \nwith a maximum velocity of 26.4 m.s-1 in October. \nThe SW wind was more frequent in periods of lower \ntemperature, but its maximum velocity of 25.1 m.s-1 \noccurred in March (Table  2). \n \n\nBenthic Macrofauna \n \n A total of 18 taxa were collected in winter \n(June, July and August). Crustacea was the most \ndiverse,  followed  by polychaeta, which also occurred \nin the other seasons. At Level 4, there was a greater \naverage index of diversity (H\u2019=1.29) and greater \naverage density of macrofauna, but the highest number \nof taxa occurred at Level 6 (Table 3). \n\nMDS and ANOSIM analyses determined the \nformation of 3 groups: Level 3, Level 4 and Levels 5 \nto  8  (ANOSIM 3x4 R=0.9 and p=0.1%; 3x5-8 R=0.8 \n\n296                                                    BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY, 55(4), 2007 \n\n\n\n \n\nTable 1.

For  \nall months in which burrows were found, there was a \ngreater concentration in dune proximities, with a \nreduction in number of burrows toward the lower parts \nof the beach. \n\n \nDISCUSSION \n\n  \nA 3-zone pattern was found based on data \n\nrecorded throughout the year: the supralittoral, where \nthe Ghost Crab Ocypode quadrata occurred; the upper \nmesolittoral, characterized by polychaeta Euzonus \nfurciferus and the isopod Excirolana armata; and the \nfinal zone including the lower mesolittoral and inner \nsurf zone, which was characterized by the tidal \nmigrants clams Donax hanleyanus and Mesodesma \nmactroides, together with the amphipod \nPhoxocephalopsis sp. The fauna of the supralittoral \nzone may be related to the subterrestrial zone \ndescribed by Dahl (1952) and the dry sand zone \ndescribed by Salvat (1964).  In the scheme proposed \nby Dahl (1952), the mesolittoral, which corresponds to \nthe retention zone proposed by Salvat (1964), is \ncharacterized by cirolanid isopods. In the present \nstudy, Excirolana armata was found in this zone, \nalong with Euzonus furciferus, similarly to what was \n\nobserved on Uruguayan beaches (DEFEO et al., \n1992a; GIM\u00c9NEZ; YANNICCELLI, 1997). The third \nfauna zone corresponds to the infralittoral zone of \nDahl (1952), that includes the resurgence and \nsaturation zones of Salvat (1964) (MCLACHLAN, \n1990).  \n\nIn a one-year accompaniment of a \nUruguayan beach with similar characteristics of the \nbeach studied in the present work, 3 zones were also \nobserved based on the annual average abundance of \neach species. In the study, however, the occurrence of \nthe talitrid amphipod Pseudorchestoidea brasiliensis \nwas  recorded  in  the  supralittoral zone (BRAZEIRO; \nDEFEO, 1996). An earlier study on Cassino Beach \nreports the occurrence of this amphipod in the \nsupralittoral zone (GIANUCA, 1983). As recorded for \nother amphipods in the estuary region of Patos \nLagoon, this species presents an aggregated \ndistribution, which is reflected in its absence from the \nsampling of the present study.   \n In winter, there was the formation of 4 \nbiological zones: the supralittoral, where the Ghost \nCrab Ocypode quadrata occurred; the upper \nmesolittoral, characterized by Euzonus furciferus and, \nto a lesser degree, Excirolana armata; the mid \nmesolittoral, represented by the amphipod \nPlatyischnopidae; and the lower mesolittoral together \nwith the inner surf zone, inhabited by the tidal \nmigrants Donax hanleyanus and Mesodesma \nmactroides.  \n\n302                                                    BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY, 55(4), 2007 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \nFig. 5. Average densities per level of the organisms with greater densities during the seasons of the year. The letters A, B, C and \nD refer to winter, spring, summer and fall, respectively (June 2004 to May 2005). \n \n \n\nThe winter zonation pattern presented a \ndivision of the mesolittoral zone, similar to that found \nby James and Fairweather (1996). Raffaelli et al. \n(1991) concluded that up to 3 zones based on \nmacrofauna assemblages could be identified within the \n\nmesolittoral zone defined by Dahl (1952). The \ndivision of the mesolittoral zone was mainly due to the \noccurrence of the amphipod Platyischnopidae. The \nlow temperatures of the season may determine the \ndistribution  of  the  amphipod  in this zone.

(1990) observed that amphipods were more \nimportant in the infralittoral than in the mesolittoral \nzone, suggesting that higher temperatures exclude \namphipods from the upper parts of the beach. \n\nAnother factor that may have influenced the \ndivision of the mesolittoral zone was the low density \nof organisms found in winter, mainly stemming from \nthe absence of recruitments. Even if meteorological \nfactors are the main cause of variations in water level \non the beach studied (CALLIARI; KLEIN, 1993), \nwhere winds from the south can raise the sea level by \nas much as 2 m (BARLETTA; CALLIARI, 2003), the \ngreater frequency of southwestern winds, which \nreached as much as 16.1 m.s-1 in the 7 days prior to the \nsampling, did not cause a significant superimposing of \norganisms, probably due to the low density of benthic \nmacrofauna in the period.  \n\nIn spring, a 3-zone pattern was found, with \nthe supralittoral composed basically of Ocypode \nquadrata, the upper mesolittoral dominated by \nEuzonus furciferus and the lower mesolittoral together \nwith the inner surf zone characterized by amphipod \nBathyporeiapus sp., polychaeta Scolelepis gaucha and \nMesodesma mactroides. The spring zonation pattern \nfits into Dahl proposal (1952), but, similar to what \noccurred in the upper mesolittoral in winter, the \ncirolanid isopod zone was inhabited mostly by \nEuzonus furciferus. On a dissipative beach in \nUruguay, Defeo et al. (1992a) observed that \nExcirolana armata and Euzonus furciferus were \ndominant organisms in the mesolittoral zone, the latter \nbeing responsible for 44% of the overall benthic \nmacrofauna on the beach.  \n\nThe high densities of Bathyporeiapus sp. and \nScolelepis gaucha in spring were probably the cause of \nthe junction of levels located from the upper swash \nzone to the last level, located in the inner surf zone, \nthereby forming a single broad band that corresponded \nto the infralittoral zone of Dahl (1952).  \n\nOn a beach in the state of Paran\u00e1 (Brazil), \nBathyporeiapus ruffoi was normally well represented \nin the lower zones of the beach, extending its \ndistribution with high abundance into the infralittoral \nzone, especially in the spring months (BORZONE; \nSOUZA, 1997). In the present study area, the action of \nthe south, southwest and southeast winds, which \noccurred in the 7 days prior to the sampling, reaching \nvelocities of up to 24.6 m.s-1, raised the sea level and \nshould have collaborated to the increased density of \nBathyporeiapus sp. in the mid mesolittoral zone. In \nthis zone, the amphipod significantly superimposed its \ndistribution  with Scolelepis gaucha, the latter of \nwhich  a  species  that  present  greater  density  in  the \nmesolittoral zone, with values reaching 100 000 m-2 in \nspring and early summer (SANTOS, 1991).  \n\nOn flatter beaches, the lower zones can often \nbe fused and divided (DEFEO; MCLACHLAN, \n\n2005). In Chile, Jaramillo et al. (1993) observed that \nthe lower zone of the beach was broader on most \ndissipative beaches in comparison to other types of \nbeaches. Gim\u00e9nez and Yannicelli (1997) observed that \nseasonal changes in wind direction may cause a \nvariation in the position of the swash zone, leading to \nthe superimposing of species and broadening the lower \nzone of the beach. Furthermore, McLachlan (1990) \nverified that species inhabiting the lower zones of the \nbeach can extend their distribution to the infralittoral \nzone, which may explain the greater amplitude of the \nlower zone of the beach.  \n\nA differentiated zonation pattern was found \nin summer, when up to 5 zones were identified: the \nsupralittoral, composed of Ocypode quadrata; the \nupper mesolittoral, dominated by Scolelepis gaucha \nand Excirolana armata; the mid mesolittoral, \nrepresented by Scolelepis gaucha and Mesodesma \nmactroides; the lower mesolittoral, inhabited mostly \nby the tidal migrants Mesodesma mactroides and \nDonax hanleyanus together with Bathyporeiapus sp; \nand the inner surf zone, characterized by Mesodesma \nmactroides and Emerita braziliensis (Anomura, \nHippidae).  \n\nThe similarity between the groups that \ncharacterized the upper mesolittoral and inner surf \nzone was influenced by the low densities of benthic \nmacrofauna at the two levels. A relevant factor for this \nsimilarity was the low density of Euzonus furciferus in \nthe  upper  mesolittoral  zone,  a  zone  which was well \ncharacterized by this species in the other seasons of \nthe year. In summer, E. furciferus presented greater \nabundance   at  a  level  below  the  upper  mesolittoral \nzone, but even here its abundance was still not very \nhigh. The greater abundance at a lower level of the \nbeach (mid mesolittoral) may be the result of a damper \nsubstrate, which would favor the survival of this \nspecies in summer, season when occur the higher \nincidence of sunlight and warmer temperatures.  \n\nDuring the summer months, a greater \nnumber of people visit Cassino Beach, with \nconsequently greater vehicle traffic precisely in the \nzone where the polychaeta occur, which may have \ninfluenced the lower density of Euzonus furciferus for \nthe period. Jaramillo et al. (1996) observed no \nevidence of human impact on the benthic macrofauna \nof a Chilean beach, but Gianuca (1983) pointed out \nthat vehicles of all types, including trucks used by \nfishermen, affect the macrofauna of Cassino Beach.  \n\nMoreover, the low density of the inner surf \nzone reflects the turbulence of this zone, where \nhydrodynamic conditions are severe and cause \ninstability in the substrate. In a study on Dutch \nbeaches, Janssen and Mulder (2005) observed a low \ndiversity of species together with lower abundance in \nthe surf zone.    \n\n304                                                    BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY, 55(4), 2007 \n\n\n\n \n\nThe possible segregation of the other two \nbiological zones (mid and lower mesolittoral) was \npartially due to the greater occurrence of Scolelepis \ngaucha in the mid mesolittoral. Even with the \nsuperimposing of Mesodesma mactroides recruits in \nthe lower part of this zone (the species has two \nrecruitment periods \u2013 one between November and \nJanuary, and another between February and April \n(DEFEO et al., 1992b), the low frequency of winds \nfrom the south, except the SE in December, may not \nhave been sufficient enough to superimpose the \nspecies and thereby fuse these zones, as occurred in \nspring. Even with this separation, the 2 zones were not \nas distinct as the upper zones. McLachlan (1990) \nobserved that the lower zones of the beach were less \nclearly defined than the upper levels, though the \ndefinition was still evident. \n\nIn general, we can compare the summer \nzonation pattern to that proposed by Salvat (1964). \nThus, the supralittoral, upper mesolittoral, mid \nmesolittoral and lower mesolittoral respectively \ncorresponded to the dry sand, retention, resurgence \nand saturation zones of Salvat (1964). The inner surf \nzone was much more evident in this season and was \nseparated from the lower zones of the beach. \n\nSimilar to the summer zonation pattern \nfound in the present study, Barros et al. (2001) and \nBorzone et al. (2003) observed that the resurgence \nzone was characterized by abundance peaks of \nScolelepis squamata. \n\nIn fall, the 3-zone pattern repeated once \nagain, with the supralittoral composed basically of \nOcypode quadrata, the upper mesolittoral inhabited by \nEuzonus furciferus and Mesodesma mactroides and \nthe final zone, including the lower mesolittoral and the \ninner surf zone, was largely characterized by Donax \nhanleyanus. This pattern can be related to that \nproposed by Dahl (1952), but it should be pointed out \nthat the zonation scheme the author suggests is only \nbased on crustacean distribution, whereas in the \npresent study, other classes along with the Crustacea \nwere found in the distinct zones of the beach in \ndifferent seasons.  \n\nEuzonus furciferus once again characterized \nthe upper mesolittoral in fall, significantly extending \nits distribution to a level below. This was especially \ndue to the recruitment of the polychaeta, which \noccurred in this season. Kemp (1988) observed that \nEuzonus mucronata adults were restricted to the upper \nmesolittoral, whereas juveniles settled both within and \nbelow this zone. This can explain the significant \nexpansion in the distribution of Euzonus furciferus at \nthis time of year. Throughout the study, E. furciferus \nextended its distribution principally to Level 4, but this  \nwas only evident in fall, as a result of the recruitment \nof the species. \n\nIn the present study, the lower zone of the \nbeach in fall encompassed nearly the entirety of the \nswash zone, and was inhabited largely by Donax \nhanleyanus recruits. Cardoso and Veloso (2003) found \na similar result for a tropical beach, recording higher \nabundances of this species in winter and fall, when \nrecruits were mainly found in the swash zone.  \n\nDuring the study,  the levels 1 and 2 \n(supralittoral) were not considered in the multivariate \nanalyses because there were many organisms \noriginated from the stranding, i.e. organisms that were \nflung to these levels by storms, without the possibility \nof their returning to the lower parts of the beach, \nconsequently interfering in the recognition  of the \nzones. This phenomenon is commonly observed in \nsand beaches of Rio Grande do Sul, Uruguay and \nArgentina, where strong southern winds carry and \ndeposit a large number of organisms on the upper parts \nof the beach (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2004). \n\nIn summary, zonation on Cassino Beach \nproved to be variable throughout the seasons of the \nyear, however, based on the data for the entire year, \nthe following general zonation pattern is suggested: \nthe supralittoral, characterized by Ocypode quadrata; \nthe upper mesolittoral, characterized by the polychaeta \nEuzonus furciferus; and a broad lower zone, more \nvariable, including the lower mesolittoral and the inner \nsurf zone, characterized by diverse species.  \n\nThe two upper zones (supralittoral and upper \nmesolittoral) were more stable throughout the study \nperiod. Brazeiro and Defeo (1996) observed that the \nsupralittoral was the zone that presented greater \nstability over time, which was corroborated in the \npresent study. This stability was also recorded for the \nupper mesolittoral zone, principally due to the \ndistribution and occurrence of Euzonus furciferus. \nBorzone et al. (1996) concluded that biological zones \nmay be more evident in the presence of sedentary \nspecies than in the presence of migrant ones. Euzonus  \nfurciferus was found at depths greater than 10 cm in \nthe sediment, which should have influenced the greater \nstability of this zone.  \n\nThe greater variability of benthic \nmacrofauna in the lower zone of the beach, which \nincluded the lower mesolittoral and the inner surf \nzone, was evident seasonally with the formation of \ndistinct fauna groups according to the peculiarity of \neach season.  \n\nIn winter, the formation of two groups in the \nlower zone of the beach was mainly due to the low \ndensity of organisms, reflecting the absence of \nrecruitment. Even with the greater frequency of SW \nwinds on the days preceding the sampling, with a \nconsequent rise in sea level, the low density of benthic \nmacrofauna may have impeded the significant \nsuperimposing of species, resulting in the formation of \n\n                         NEVES ET AL.: ZONATION OF BENTHIC MACROFAUNA ON CASSINO BEACH                          305\n\n\n\n \n\ntwo groups. In spring, the high density of individuals \nat the lower levels of the beach, together with strong \nwinds that likely raised the sea level, caused the \nexpressive superimposing of species resulting in the \nformation of a single large group.  \n\nIn summer, recruitments and milder \nhydrodynamic conditions may have led to the \nformation of three groups in the lower zone of the \nbeach. Even with the high densities of benthic \nmacrofauna, the frequency of winds from south in the \n7 days prior to sampling was probably not sufficient \nenough to cause the superimposing of species. In this \nseason, the separation of the group corresponding to \nthe inner surf zone became more evident as a result of \ngreater densities in the swash zone, reflecting the \nrecruitment of tidal migrants. In fall, there was once \nagain the formation of a single group in the lower zone \nof the beach, reflecting the recruitment of one tidal \nmigrant (Donax hanleyanus) in the swash zone.  \n\nIn general, the spatial variability of the \nbenthic macrofauna groupings in the lower zone of the \nbeach during the distinct seasons of the year was \nstrongly influenced by fluctuations in densities \nstemming from both recruitments and the migration of \njuvenile and adult infauna. Another factor that \ninfluenced the vertical distribution of benthic \nmacrofauna was the superimposing of species \ndistribution due to the rise in sea level during storms.   \n \n\nREFERENCES \n \nALBERTO, R.
