A obduc\u00e7\u00e3o deste ofiolito sobre a plataforma ar\u00e1bica \n\nocorreu durante o Cret\u00e1cico Superior, relacionando-se com o fecho do oceano T\u00e9tis. A sequ\u00eancia \n\nobductada pode atingir os 20 km de espessura e ocupa toda a regi\u00e3o nordeste do Sultanado (Montanhas \n\nde Om\u00e3), formando uma faixa de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NE-SE com ca. de 550 km de comprimento e 150 km de \n\nlargura. Da base para o topo esta sequ\u00eancia compreende harzburgitos tectonizados (manto superior), \n\numa por\u00e7\u00e3o gabroica com texturas variadas cortada por dioritos e trondjemitos, e um complexo de diques  \n\nque alimenta a sequ\u00eancia extrusiva (lavas em almofada) superior. Esta \u00faltima pode ser subdividida , \n\ndependendo dos autores, at\u00e9 um m\u00e1ximo de 5 unidades principais. Geotimes \u00e9 a unidade basal desta \n\nsequ\u00eancia extrusiva, repousando diretamente sobre o complexo de dique em dique. Sobre esta assenta a \n\nunidade Lasail que, de acordo com Kusano et al. (2012), desenvolve interdigita\u00e7\u00f5es com a Geotimes \n\nsugerindo a possibilidade de corresponder a uma mera subunidade da \u00faltima. A unidade Alley repousa \n\nsobre as duas \u00faltimas e partilha uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o espacial com a unidade Bonin\u00edtica. \n\nOs dep\u00f3sitos de sulfuretos maci\u00e7os vulcanog\u00e9nicos localizam-se maioritariamente na regi\u00e3o norte de \n\nOm\u00e3, entre as sequ\u00eancias l\u00e1vicas, sobretudo na transi\u00e7\u00e3o Geotimes-Lasail. Barrie e Hannington (1999) \n\ndescrevem estes dep\u00f3sitos como sendo do tipo m\u00e1fico devido \u00e0 natureza das rochas encaixantes t\u00edpicas  \n\nnestes sistemas ofiol\u00edticos. Os min\u00e9rios s\u00e3o ricos em Cu e pobres em Pb quando comparados com outros  \n\ndep\u00f3sitos do tipo VMS (Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide). As primeiras evid\u00eancias de minera\u00e7\u00e3o destes \n\ndep\u00f3sitos remontam \u00e0 Idade do Bronze, tendo incidido sobretudo nos dom\u00ednios de enriquecimento \n\nsecund\u00e1rio (superg\u00e9nico) de cobre. As minas de Lasail, Bayda e Aarja, no distrito de Sohar, representam \n\nas primeiras explora\u00e7\u00f5es de min\u00e9rio, rico em calcopirite, conhecidas no pa\u00eds.  \n\nO dep\u00f3sito de Mandoos 1 localiza-se no norte de Om\u00e3, no distrito de Sohar, e foi descoberto em 2009 \n\nap\u00f3s campanha de prospe\u00e7\u00e3o geof\u00edsica (VTEM). Trata-se de um dep\u00f3sito oculto, coberto por gravilha s  \n\nn\u00e3o consolidadas, possivelmente hospedado na unidade vulc\u00e2nica Alley. A modela\u00e7\u00e3o tridimensiona l \n\ndo dep\u00f3sito com o software MICROMINE revela um corpo mineralizado com 550 m de comprimento \n\ne largura m\u00e1xima de 370 m, alongado segundo NW-SE e inclinado para SE; a sua espessura varia entre \n\n1 e 90 m. O c\u00e1lculo do volume da lent\u00edcula de min\u00e9rio aponta para um valor global de 1.8 milh\u00f5es m3 \n\nque, assumindo uma densidade m\u00e9dia de 4.44 g/cm3, resulta numa tonelagem de min\u00e9rio de \n\naproximadamente 8 Mt com 1.72 wt% Cu. A modela\u00e7\u00e3o espacial da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos valores de \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Cu e Zn no dep\u00f3sito n\u00e3o colocou em evid\u00eancia qualquer tipo de zonamento \n\ncomposicional relevante. \n\nEm Mandoos, duas campanhas distintas de amostragem foram efetuadas: uma amostragem pontua l \n\nlevada a cabo pela Dra. Ana Jesus em 2015, ao longo da frente de explora\u00e7\u00e3o Este; e uma amostragem \n\nem sondagens cedidas pela Mawarid \u00e0 Universidade GUtech. Destas amostragens resultou uma cole\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde 42 amostras, 27 das quais referentes a min\u00e9rios sulfuretados, 6 representando jaspes mineralizados , \n\n5 documentando sedimentos metal\u00edferos e 4 basaltos mineralizados. Todas estas amostras foram alvo \n\nde caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o petrogr\u00e1fica e geoqu\u00edmica detalhada com o intuito de contribuir com informa\u00e7\u00f5es \u00fateis  \n\n\u00e0 compreens\u00e3o do dep\u00f3sito de Mandoos e ao estabelecimento de um modelo metalogen\u00e9tico coerente. \n\nOs min\u00e9rios associados a dep\u00f3sitos do tipo m\u00e1fico s\u00e3o geralmente dominados por pirite, apresentando \n\nquantidades subordinadas de calcopirite e esfalerite. Tal \u00e9 observado nos min\u00e9rios texturalmente e \n\nmineralogicamente mon\u00f3tonos de Mandoos 1, os quais incluem ainda brechas cimentadas por s\u00edlica e \n\n\n\nVI \n \n\nalguns filossilicatos. Os sulfuretos de ferro predominam (principalmente pirite), ocorrendo ainda  \n\ncalcopirite, esfalerite, algumas fases mais ricas em cobre e, raramente, galena. Por sua vez, as fases \n\nminerais constituintes da ganga correspondem maioritariamente a quartzo, filossilicatos e laumontite .  \n\nOs min\u00e9rios s\u00e3o relativamente pouco retrabalhados termicamente, permitindo a preserva\u00e7\u00e3o de um \n\ngrande n\u00famero de arranjos espaciais prim\u00e1rios, sendo bastante comum a presen\u00e7a de texturas \n\nframboidais e colom\u00f3rficas, para al\u00e9m de icnof\u00f3sseis tipo polychetae piritizados. A origem biog\u00e9nic a  \n\nde texturas framboidais foi rejeitada, tendo esta sido esta atribu\u00edda \u00e0 propriedade ferromagn\u00e9tica da \n\ngreigite, precursor da pirite em texturas framboidais. As fases mais ricas em Cu (bornite, covelite e \n\nspionkopite) s\u00e3o correlacion\u00e1veis com os est\u00e1dios mais tardios de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o, evidenciando um \n\nevento mais oxidante. Esta lent\u00edcula mineralizada \u00e9 alimentada por um stock work caracterizado por \n\nbasaltos silicificados com dissemina\u00e7\u00f5es de pirite e alguns veios preenchidos por pirite e calcopirite , \n\nn\u00e3o sendo evidente o desenvolvimento de uma rede anastomosada de veios mineralizados.  \n\nTexturas prim\u00e1rias de marcassite (colom\u00f3rfica) e crescimentos de wurtzite em espa\u00e7o aberto (e em \n\ncontexto proximal de black -smoker) s\u00e3o observadas em algumas das amostras estudadas. Contudo, a \n\ncoexist\u00eancia de duas fases de ferro (pirite e marcassite) e de zinco (esfalerite e wurtzite) foi atribu\u00edda \u00e0s \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas abruptas que se podem fazer sentir, em poucos cent\u00edmetros, nestes sistemas. \n\nEstas duas fases (marcassite e wurtzite) cristalizam preferencialmente em equil\u00edbrio com solu\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nhidrotermais \u00e1cidas, sendo a mistura destas solu\u00e7\u00f5es com a \u00e1gua do mar respons\u00e1vel pelo aumento de \n\npH que, por sua vez, conduz ao desenvolvimento das fases mais est\u00e1veis nessas condi\u00e7\u00f5es (pirite e \n\nesfalerite) \n\nRelativamente aos sedimentos metal\u00edferos (umbers e ochres), estes evidenciam texturas sedimentares \n\ncom altern\u00e2ncias de bandas mais ricas ou empobrecidas em \u00f3xidos e hidr\u00f3xidos de ferro. \n\nAdicionalmente, observam-se tamb\u00e9m pseudomorfoses de sulfuretos, completamente oxidados. Por sua \n\nvez os jaspes mineralizados apresentam abundantes dissemina\u00e7\u00f5es de sulfuretos, sendo ainda cortados \n\npor veios selados por pirite e calcopirite. A forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos jaspes foi interpretada como s\u00edncrona do \n\nevento evolutivo mais oxidante, respons\u00e1vel pela forma\u00e7\u00e3o das fases mais ricas em Cu, enquanto a \n\ng\u00e9nese dos sedimentos metal\u00edferos foi atribu\u00edda a eventos tardios de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o da lent\u00edcula mineraliza da  \n\nno fundo oce\u00e2nico e/ou \u00e0 precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de metais libertados para a coluna de \u00e1gua em contexto exalativo \n\ne ambiente oxidante. \n\nOs dados de natureza geoqu\u00edmica, mais precisamente a an\u00e1lise dos padr\u00f5es de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o normalizada  \n\nde terras raras, sugere que a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos min\u00e9rios sulfuretados ter\u00e1 sido governada por misturas de \n\n\u00e1gua do mar e fluido hidrotermal, tal como nos jaspes, embora com propor\u00e7\u00f5es distintas. Os padr\u00f5es \n\nobtidos para os sedimentos metal\u00edferos (umbers e ochres) sugerem adsor\u00e7\u00e3o significativa de terras raras \n\ndispon\u00edveis na \u00e1gua do mar pelos filossilicatos constituintes dos sedimentos. As terras raras contidas nos \n\nmin\u00e9rios sulfuretados e nos jaspes dever\u00e3o resultar da lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o dos basaltos a muro da mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3 o, \n\naquando da altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal. Os enriquecimentos em terras raras evidenciados pelas amostras de \n\nmin\u00e9rio e jaspes podem ser alcan\u00e7ados com uma mistura de \u00e1gua do mar:basalto entre 0.85:0.15 e \n\n0.99:0.01 para basaltos pouco alterados e entre 0.50:0.50 e 0.95:0.05 no caso de basaltos alterados. A \n\nmodela\u00e7\u00e3o das magnitudes caracter\u00edsticas dos fluidos hidrotermais de an\u00e1logos modernos (TAG e EPR) \n\npodem ser simuladas com propor\u00e7\u00f5es entre 0.999:0.001 e 0.9999:0.0001, contudo a anomalia positiva  \n\nem Eu e fraciona\u00e7\u00e3o positiva em terras raras leves e pesadas t\u00edpicas nestes fluidos n\u00e3o s\u00e3o \n\ncompletamente reproduzidas. Os enriquecimentos relativos em Cd, W, Sn, Te e In revelados por alguns  \n\nmin\u00e9rios sulfuretados indicam a possibilidade do fluido hidrotermal mineralizante incluir uma \n\ncontribui\u00e7\u00e3o magm\u00e1tica (epis\u00f3dica? e muito dilu\u00edda), a qual pode ainda justificar outras diferen\u00e7as \n\ncomposicionais observadas. \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n\nPalavras-chave: Ofiolito de Sumail, Om\u00e3, sulfuretos maci\u00e7os, mineralogia dos min\u00e9rios, geoqu\u00edmica de \n\nrocha total. \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nXIII \n\nAbstract \n \n\nThe modelling of the Mandoos 1 massive sulphide deposit revealed an orebody of ca. 8 million tonnes \n\nwith an average grade of 1.72 wt% Cu. The spatial distribution of Cu and Zn concentrations suggests \n\nthat the ores are relatively homogenous in composition and were not significantly affected by metal \n\nzoning refinement processes. The massive sulphide lens is mainly composed of iron sulphide rich (pyrite  \n\n\u00b1 marcasite) breccias, cemented by silica \u00b1 phyllosilicates \u00b1 laumontite, having chalcopyrite (commonly \n\naltered to Cu-rich phases) and sphalerite as accessory minerals. The ores preserve large number of \n\nprimary textures (colloform and framboidal) and also tubeworms (polychetae). The observed large \n\namount of trace elements in the majority of mineral phases are consistent with the poor thermal \n\nreworking of the ores, also compatible with the monotonous and low diverse mineral assemblage.  This \n\nCu-rich VMS deposit is characterised by secondary Cu enrichment, developed during an oxidis ing \n\nevent, which might also be synchronous of jaspers formation. When these sulphide ores were not \n\ncovered, a seafloor weathering produced sequences of umbers and ochres with variable thickness, where \n\nmassive sulphide breccias are oxidised and impregnated with silica in a more cold and oxidis ing \n\nenvironment, although these can also be formed by direct precipitation of metals within the water \n\ncolumn, derived from exhalative discharges and deposited in such conditions. The REE normalise d \n\npatterns of sulphide ores are consistent with a mixture of seawater and vent fluids (derived from basalt \n\nleaching \u2013 SW:B). The relative REE enrichments displayed by the ore samples can be simulated by a \n\nratio of seawater (SW) and basalt (B) scattered between 0.85:0.15 and 0.99:0.01 for less altered basalts, \n\nwhile for altered basalts (B\u2019) the values range from 0.50:0.50 to 0.95:0.05. The same is observed in \n\nsulphide-mineralised jaspers, while the REE in umbers and ochres derives entirely from seawater. \n\nPresent-day vent-fluids REE magnitudes (TAG an EPR) are simulated with SW:B and SW:B\u2019 \n\ninteractions between 0.999:0.001 and 0.9999:0.0001. Nevertheless the pattern displayed by modern vent \n\nfluids, characterised by an evident Eu positive anomaly and positive LREE and HREE fractionation, is  \n\nnot completely reproduced by the performed simulation.

Introduction and Objectives \n \n\nOman, located in the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula is bordered by the United Arab \n\nEmirates (northwest), Saudi Arabia (West) and Yemen (southwest). The geologic al relevance of the \n\ncountry comes mostly because of the largest and also the best preserved slab of upper mantle, oceanic \n\ncrust and pelagic sediments in the world known as the Sumail ophiolite. A series of nappes were also \n\nemplaced along with the ophiolite; those thrust sheets comprise, from the bottom to the top, the Sumeini, \n\nHawasina, and Haybi nappes, that were emplaced onto the Arabian continental margin between \n\nConiacian and Campanian, during Neo-Tethys closure (Immenhauser et al. 2000). \n\nAccording to Barrie and Hannington (1999), the volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits (VMS) hosted \n\nin ophiolitic sequences are classified as \u201cmafic type\u201d due to the predominance of mafic rocks. Deposits \n\nof this type are normally fewer in number, smaller in size, Cu-rich and Pb-poor when compared with \n\nother types of massive sulphide ores. In Oman, VMS deposits are mostly found in the northern part of \n\nthe Sumail ophiolite, where the volcanic lava sequences are best exposed, and its exploitation goes back \n\nto the Bronze Age. \n\nThe Mandoos deposit was discovered in 2009 when the Mawarid Mining conducted a Versatile Time-\n\ndomain Electro-Magnetic (VTEM) survey over an extension of wadi gravels in the north of Oman. Four \n\nfirst-order anomalies were identified in the region and the presence of massive sulphides was confirmed \n\nduring a subsequent drilling survey. The Mandoos 1, Mandoos 2 and Mandoos 3 anomalies host massive \n\nsulphides but only the first includes Cu-mineralisation and tonnage economically viable for exploitation.  \n\nThe last anomaly (Mandoos 4) did not revealed the presence of orebodies of any kind (Mawarid Mining, \n\n2014). \n\nThe Mandoos 1 deposit is located in the Sohar region and is hosted in massive basaltic lavas  possibly \n\nrelated to the Alley volcanic unit. The mining operations started in October 2011 with extraction by \n\nopen pit and lasted till early-2015, when all activities were abandoned due to economic issues. \n\nUnderground exploration did not start due to problems with the local community. Engineers assessed a \n\ntotal mineral resource of 8 million tonnes of massive sulphides, with 5 million tonnes in reserves at 1.8% \n\nCu (Mawarid Mining, 2014). \n\nSamples for this study were obtained from in situ sampling and drill-cores picking from the assortment \n\noffered by the Company to the German University of Technology in Oman (GUtech). The main \n\nobjective of this work consists on the mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of the Mandoos  \n\nmassive sulphide ores, by means of: (1) detailed re-logging of the drill-cores at GUtech; (2) petrography \n\nand detailed mineralogical studies with an Electron Probe Micro Analyser (EPMA); (3) whole rock \n\nmulti-element geochemistry of a set of pre-selected samples from 2 different sampling surveys. All the \n\npetrography and analytical work was focused on massive sulphide samples (breccias), metalliferous  \n\nsediments (umbers and ochres) and jaspers (mineralised). The numerical analysis and modelling of data \n\nmining assay for a large number of drill cores provided by Mawarid Mining further allowed assessing \n\nthe vertical/lateral metal zonation in the orebody. The data and information collected represent a \n\nsignificant contribution to the establishment of a comprehensive metallogenetic model for the Mandoos  \n\nVMS deposit. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n2. Geological Setting \n\n3 \n \n\n2. Geological Setting \n\n2.1 Regional Setting \n\nIn Palaeozoic times, Oman was part of the Gondwana (southern half of Pangea supercontinent), bordered \n\nby Paleo-Tethys to the north and east and by Panthalassa to the west. From Late Carboniferous to Early \n\nPermian all the eastern region of Oman was covered by a thick ice sheet as recorded by tillite deposits  \n\nof the Hufq-Haushi area (Immenhauser et al. 2000). After that glaciation, a climatic warming result in \n\nlacustrine deposits in eastern Oman. The break-up of Gondwana led to the opening of two basins: the \n\nfirst rifting event separated the eastern Oman territory (Afro-Arabia) from northern Gondwana, called \n\nthe early Indian Ocean-Batain basin; the second rifting event detached the northern Arabia territory from \n\nfuture parts of Eurasia, labelled as Neo-Tethyan Hawasina basin. The rift shoulder uplift and the \n\nsimultaneous sea level rise led to the deposition of the Haushi Group sediments (shallow marine and \n\nfluvial) in the Early Permian. The subsequent global sea level rise and the thermal subsidence of the rift \n\nshoulders submerged the northern and eastern territories of Oman, resulting on the deposition of the \n\nAkhdar Group carbonates (Immenhauser et al. 2000). By the Middle-Late Permian, a large carbonate \n\nplatform was established over Oman (Saiq Formation) and this sedimentation lasted until Aptian-\n\nCenomanian. Outwards of the shelf carbonate platform, shelf slope carbonates from the Sumeini Group, \n\nproximal basin facies sediments from the Hawasina complex were developed. Two volcanic horizons, \n\ncomprising alkaline-basalts and rhyolitic tuffs from Triassic, are preserved within the Saiq Formation \n\n(Haybi complex). Sedimentation along the Arabian platform ceased at the end of Cenomanian when the \n\nAruma foreland basin was formed as a consequence of the passive margin contraction (Glennie et al., \n\n1973). In Upper Cretaceous (between Coniacian and Campanian times), the Sumeini, Hawasina, Haybi \n\nand ophiolite nappes were emplaced onto the Arabian platform. The Sumeini, Hawasina and Haybi \n\ncomplex are contemporaneous units preserving different, progressively more distal paleogeographic  \n\nfacies (Searle et al., 2003), but are nevertheless commonly referred to, as the Hawasina nappes.   \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFig 2. 1 \u2013 Geological map of northern Oman and Tethyan suture \n\nzones and ophiolites (adapted from Rollinson et al., 2014 and \n\nDilek &amp; Furnes, 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n2.1.1 Emplacement Models and Geodynamic Implications \n\nThe tectonic setting of the Sumail ophiolite is still open to discussion. According to various authors, the \n\nophiolite was originated in a typical mid-ocean ridge environment while others propose a supra-\n\nsubduction zone for its origin. The mid-ocean ridge model implies an obduction starting at the ridge; \n\ntherefore, similar ages would be expected for the ophiolite units and the subduction zone footwall \n\n(metamorphic sole and Haybi complex), which is not the case (Searle &amp; Cox, 1999). The Haybi complex \n\nis older than the ophiolite unit and records an oceanic-derived volcanism such as the Triassic alkaline  \n\n(ankaramites, nephelinites) and tholeiitic basalts (Searle &amp; Cox, 1999), as well as the Late Permian and \n\nLate Triassic limestone blocks and Cretaceous melanges. The amphibolites forming the metamorphic  \n\nsole are compositionally distinct of the ophiolite volcanic rocks and the Haybi complex alkaline basalts \n\ndisplay geochemical trends similar to those of the Haybi tholeiitic volcanic rocks (Triassic or Jurassic). \n\nTherefore, the ophiolite obduction could not have started at the mid-ocean ridge (Searle et al., 1999); \n\nthis is further reinforced by the similar dating of plagiogranites and metamorphic sole (Hacker, 1994), \n\nplacing the subduction of Haybi complex basalts beneath the ophiolite at the same time of the ophiolite  \n\nwas developed during the Cenomanian-Tourian (Searle &amp; Cox, 1999). \n\n \n\nThe plausible setting where older and colder material could be in contact with hot-forming ophiolite  \n\nrocks would be a transform-fault zone; however, clear evidence for that structural array is missing at \n\nOman (MacLeod &amp; Rothery, 1992). Searle &amp; Cox (1999) reject both previous models for the tectonic \n\nsetting that formed the Sumail ophiolite, which must have started above a northeast-dipping zone, away \n\nfrom the continental margin. The emplacement of the Sumail ophiolite began along with the Suma il \n\nthrust in a trench where older, colder ocean floor rocks (Haybi complex) were being subducted to the \n\nNE beneath the Sumail ophiolite, at the same time or right after the Sumail crustal sequence formation.  \n\nBetween 97-75 Ma the ophiolite was formed at a spreading centre above a northeast-dipping zone. The \n\nsubduction of Haybi volcanic rocks reached 12-14 km below the Moho and their metamorphic  \n\nrecrystallisation achieved the upper amphibolitic facies conditions in a time span between 95-93 Ma \n\n(Searle &amp; Cox, 1999). Those amphibolites formed the metamorphic sole and were welded to the base of \n\nthe mantle sequence of the ophiolite. During burial processes, greenschist facies metamorphism affected \n\nthe Haybi volcanic rocks, manganiferous cherts, exotic limestones, and shales, and they were welded \n\nonto the base of the amphibolites. All this sequence, ophiolite and metamorphic sole, was then emplaced \n\nonto the Arabian platform, reaching a distance of 350-400 km in a southwest direction (Searle &amp; Cox, \n\n1999). \n\nFig 2. 2 \u2013 Emplacement model where \n\nthe mid-ocean ridge is the starting  \n\npoint for the ophiolite obduction (in  \n\nSearle &amp; Cox, 1999) \n\n \n\n\n\n2. Geological Setting \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\nFig 2. 3 \u2013 Model for the ophiolite obduction in the northern Oman showing; A \u2013 structural position of Sumeini, Hawasina and \n\nHaybi complexes before the emplacement; B \u2013 formation of the metamorphic sole (in Searle &amp; Cox, 1999). \n\nPaleo-depths of metamorphism were estimated from high-pressure metamorphic rocks presently located \n\nin the southeastern sector of the ophiolite. All the continental margin of the Oman Mountains was \n\nsubducted to lower levels, in opposition to the central sector where no high-pressure metamorphic rocks \n\nare known. The deepest metamorphism is recorded by the As Sifah eclogites (garnet + clinopyroxene + \n\nglaucophane + phengite\u2013bearing metabasalts and garnet + chloritoid\u2013bearing metapelites) that were \n\nsubducted to depths around 90 km. The eclogites occur within the Permian carbonated Saiq formation \n\nand evolved along a clockwise P-T path culminating at 20\u201323 \u00b1 2.5 kbar and 540 \u00b1 75 \u00b0C, suggesting \n\nthat the continental crust was subducted underneath the ophiolite. Medium-pressure rocks are known in \n\nthe northern part of the ophiolite from crossite- and glaucophane-bearing metabasalts in the north of \n\nOman and high-pressure garnet amphibolites in the United Arab Emirates; however, in Bani Hamid \n\narea, the granulite facies point to P-T conditions of metamorphism of 6\u20139 kbar and 850 \u00b0C. In opposition \n\nto the Haybi complex that formed the majority of the metamorphic sole, the protoliths of granulites were \n\nquartzites and carbonates from the continental margin (Searle &amp; Cox, 1999). \n\n  \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n2.1.2 The Sumail Ophiolite \n\nThe Sumail ophiolite, also referred as Semail or Samail in the literature, has been recognised as the best \n\npreserved and largest slab of upper mantle, oceanic crust and pelagic sediments accessible on land. It \n\nwas emplaced from NE to SW onto the Arabian passive continental margin, during late Cretaceous times \n\ndue to the closure of the Tethys Ocean. With approximately 550 km long and 150 km wide (Searle et \n\nal., 1999) the ophiolite belt comprises a complete section of the upper crust peridotites (8 \u2013 12 km) and \n\noceanic crust (4 \u2013 7 km) (Lippard et al., 1986), exposing a slice of oceanic lithosphere up to 20 km thick.   \n\nThe typical oceanic lithosphere is entirely exposed in the Sumail ophiolite and its emplacement onto the \n\nArabian platform did not result in significant structural dismembering; i.e., despite of regional doming \n\nand local thrusting, primary lithostratigraphic relationships are fairly preserved. It is believed that the \n\noceanic nappe, along with several structurally underlying nappes, was emplaced in its present position \n\n(Glennie et al., 1973). \n\nThe mantle sequence of the Sumail ophiolite is mainly composed of tectonised harzburgite, originate d \n\nby partial melting of fertile primary spinel lherzolite (Searle et al., 1999). Below the Moho, high \n\ntemperature mineral lineations formed due to the plastic flow during mantle upwelling and diverging \n\naway from the ridge. Mineral fabrics originated during the ophiolite emplacement overprint these early \n\nmantle fabrics along the base, as evident in a strongly banded harzburgite -lherzolite-dunite basal unit.  \n\nThe appearance of plagioclase marks the petrological Moho, where dunite pods with small chromite-\n\nrich lenses occur (Searle &amp; Cox, 1999).  \n\nThe oceanic crustal section of the ophiolite is composed of cumulate gabbros overlain by isotropic  \n\ngabbros which are intruded by diorites and trondhjemites; some discordant wehrlites can intrude higher \n\nlevels of the crustal sequence. A sheeted dyke complex outlines the main pathways that fed the extrusive  \n\npillow lavas (Searle &amp; Cox, 1999). Up to 2 km of lavas form the upper sequence of the ophiolite , \n\noutcropping mostly in northern part of Oman. The volcanic sequence can be subdivided into different \n\nunits depending on the authors, resulting in a maximum of five major units (Alabaster et al, 1982; Gilge n \n\net al., 2014), as addressed below.  \n\n \n\nFig 2. 4 \u2013 Subduction-zone emplacement model showing the internal structure of the ophiolite (in Searl &amp; Cox, 1999). \n\n\n\n2. Geological Setting \n\n7 \n \n\n2.1.3 Volcano-stratigraphic Sequence \n\nAs aforementioned, the upper section of the ophiolite nappe is composed of up to 2 km of pillow lavas \n\ncovered by up to 30 m of pelagic sediments containing microfossils of Cenomanian to Turonian age \n\n(Gilgen et al., 2014). U-Pb zircon ages of trondhjemites from many different levels along the ophiolite  \n\nsection fall in the time window from 97.3 to 94.4 Ma (Rollinson, 2009). Those ages, considered together \n\nwith micropaleontology data gathered from pelagic sediments interbedded in the lavas, allow inferring \n\nthat the seafloor volcanism was active during ca. 10 m.y. (from ca. 98.9 to 89 Ma). According to Searle \n\nand Malpas (1982), it took 3 to 7 m.y. from the volcanism cessation until the ophiolite obduction; other \n\nauthors assume that the time span was even shorter, from 1 to 2 m.y. The Sumail ophiolite lavas form a \n\ndefined set of volcano-stratigraphic units presumably derived from overlapping volcanic centres at \n\nspreading axes and, thereafter, at off-axis locations (Gilgen et al., 2014). Five lava units were \n\ndistinguished by Alabaster et al. (1982) according to field, petrological and geochemical characteristics; \n\nthese are labelled as Geotimes, Lasail, Alley, Clinopyroxene-phyric, and Salahi. \n\nGeotimes is the lowermost unit of the extrusive volcanism; it lays directly on top of the sheeted dyke \n\ncomplex and can vary between 0.75 and 1.5km in thickness (Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986).  \n\nThese lavas can be recognised in the field considering: (i) the common occurrence of tubular pillow s  \n\ninstead of massive flows; (ii) the scarcity of amygdule and variole-rich textures; and (iii) the typica l \n\nreddish-brown colour due to the widespread, fine-grained hematite dissemination and hematite-rich \n\ninter-pillow hyaloclastites. They are slightly depleted in incompatible trace elements when compared to \n\nN-MORB basalts, along with negative anomalies of Nb and Ta (Godard et al., 2003) \n\nThe Lasail unit overlies, at least locally, Geotimes. According to Alabaster and Pearce (1985), the Lasail \n\nunit is restricted to some areas, being interpreted as a product of off-axis volcanism. However, follow ing \n\nKusano et al. (2012), the Lasail unit is inter-fingered with Geotimes and can be simply envisaged as a \n\nsubunit of the latter. It consists of grey to pale green basaltic to andesitic pillow lavas that can vary from \n\n0 to 0.75 km thick (Lippard et al., 1986); the typical green colour is due to the relative abundance of \n\nepidote and chlorite. Geochemically, the Lasail lavas are depleted in both light rare earth elements \n\n(LREE) and incompatible elements when compared to N-MORB basalts (Godard et al., 2003). \n\nThe Alley unit lies on top of both Geotimes and Lasail, and comprises grey and brown pillowed and \n\nmassive flows, as well as basalt breccias; this unit can vary from 0.75 to 2 km in thickness. The 2 to 3 \n\nmeters of pillows are characterised by abundant amygdule filled with zeolites and celadonite, besides \n\nglomerophyric clusters of clinopyroxene (Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986). The Alley and \n\nLasail lavas share a similar normalised pattern for rare earth element (REE), although the concentration \n\nin LREE is slightly lower in Alley lavas. These two units can be also differentiated on the basis of Zr \n\nand Cr contents (Lippard et al., 1986). \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nFig 2. 5 \u2013 Schematic representation of the volcano-stratighaphic sequence of the northern Oman \n\nillustrating also the position of some VMS deposits (adapted from Gilgen et al., 2014). \n\nOverlying these three volcanic units, some small-volume basaltic flows with abundant clinopyroxe ne  \n\nphenocrysts are found, belonging to the Clinopyroxene-phyric unit; these lavas area characterised by \n\nlower Zr and Ti contents but higher Cr grades (Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986). The Salahi \n\nunit consists of alkaline to transitional within-plate lavas (Alabaster et al., 1982). These two latter units  \n\nare restricted to specific areas and they are not found anywhere else besides the outcrops reported in \n\nAlabaster et al. (1982); both units are not associated with any sulphide mineralization (Gilgen et al., \n\n2014). Some boninitic outcrops show a spatial relationship with Alley lavas. Those lavas have regiona l \n\nmeaning but it is not clear if all the occurrences are limited to just one stratigraphic unit; they usually \n\noccur as vesicular pillows and sheet flows, reaching several meters in thickness, with  \n\n(micro)phenocrysts of orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, olivine, and chrome-spinel (Gilgen et al., 2014).  \n\nSome boninitic dykes found in the Shinas mine are younger than the Alley lavas, suggesting that their \n\ndevelopment and emplacement took place, at least in some areas, after the Alley unit.  \n\n2.2 VMS Deposits  \n\nVolcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposits precipitate from hydrothermal fluids and form \n\nstratiform accumulations of sulphides at sea floor level. Commonly associated with volcanic rocks, this  \n\ntype of deposits represent an important source of Cu, Zn, Pb, Au, and Ag along with Co, Sn, Ba, S, Se, \n\nMn, Cd, In, Bi, Te, Ga, and Ge as co- or by-products. The study of active, metal-precipitating \n\nhydrothermal vents on the sea floor has been the key factor to understand the land-based VMS deposits \n\nformation (Barrie and Hannington, 1999). \n\n\n\n2. Geological Setting \n\n9 \n \n\nA five-fold classification is commonly used to describe most of ancient and active VMS deposits. This  \n\nclassification is mainly based on the composition of the host rocks, assuming that the metals in sulphide  \n\nores derive mostly from leaching and scavenging of a footwall substrate. The main five types of host \n\nrocks composition where the classification is rooted are: mafic, bimodal-mafic, mafic-siliciclas tic , \n\nbimodal-felsic, and bimodal-silicic lastic (Barrie and Hannington, 1999). \n\nThe \u201cmafic type\u201d is defined by the larger predominance of mafic rocks on the hosting stratigraphic \n\nsequence given the rare or even absence of felsic rocks, although minor siliciclastic or ultramafic rocks \n\ncan be present. Ophiolites are one of the settings classified as mafic and most of the examples from this \n\ntype are exclusively Phanerozoic in age. Ocean ridges, advanced back-arc rifts and supra-subduction \n\nspreading zones are the common settings where modern analogues of this type are found. The basaltic  \n\nhost rock is predominantly tholeiitic, with some local boninitic occurrences. Mafic VMS deposits are \n\nnormally fewer in number, smaller, Cu-rich and Pb-poor in comparison with the other massive sulphide  \n\ndeposit types (Barrie and Hannington, 1999). \n\nThe \u201cbimodal-mafic\u201d type is characterised by having more than 50% of mafic rocks and a low  \n\npercentage (> 3%) of felsic ones in the hosting sequence; the mafic/felsic ratio is 3:1 or greater, but \n\nfelsic volcanic rocks are usually the nearest host rocks. The composition of the volcanic host rocks \n\npoints to primitive volcanic arcs or rifted primitive volcanic arc settings. Mafic rocks are usually basaltic  \n\nand tholeiitic (can be transitional to calc-alkaline), while felsic rocks have a rhyolitic composition or \n\ntransitional with calc-alkaline rhyolites. Noranda (Quebec) and Kidd Creek (Ontario) are the two main \n\nexamples of this \u201cbimodal-mafic\u201d type, although Kidd Creek is atypical due to its ultramafic footwall.  \n\nThe \u201cmafic-siliciclastic\u201d VMS type has identical proportions of mafic or intrusive rocks and siliciclas tic  \n\n(turbidites); in this VMS type, felsic rocks occur in small amounts or may even be absent from the \n\nhosting sequence. The Besshi deposit in Japan is one land-based example of this VMS type, similar to \n\nthe VMS occurrences in the rifted continental margin in the Gulf of California, the Middle Valley rift, \n\nor in the Escanaba trough at the northeast Pacific Ocean, or in the Atlantis II deeps of the Red Sea. \n\nThe \u201cbimodal-felsic\u201d VMS type is characterised by a higher content of felsic volcanic rocks (>50 %) in \n\ncomparison with siliciclastic rocks (<15 %) in the volcano-stratigraphic hosting sequence; mafic rocks \n\nusually complete the hosting sequence. Like in \u201cbimodal-mafic\u201d VMS deposits, deposits hosted in \n\n\u201cbimodal-felsic\u201d sequences share the same age distribution, but are more abundant in Phanerozoic times, \n\nusually related to more compositionally mature volcanic arcs, or rifted volcanic arc settings than the \n\n\u201cbimodal-mafic\u201d VMS types. High-silica rhyolite compositions are common in the felsic host rocks with \n\ncalc-alkaline to transitional affinities, while the mafic rocks comprise calc-alkaline or transitiona l \n\ntholeiitic to calc-alkaline rocks. This VMS type contains, in average, higher contents of Zn and Ag in \n\ncomparison with all the other VMS types (Barrie and Hannington, 1999). \n\nThe last type of VMS deposit is the \u201cbimodal-silic ic lastic\u201d which has equivalent proportions of volcanic  \n\nrocks (usually felsic rocks are much more abundant than mafic) and siliciclastic rocks. These deposits  \n\nare usually found in belts of Phanerozoic age (like the Iberian Pyrite Belt, Portugal and Spain). Some \n\nauthors refer that the felsic volcanic hosting rocks are generally calc-alkaline; however, this \n\ncompositional feature is usually due to crustal assimilation and that is consistent with continental arc or \n\nrifted continental arc settings. Tholeiitic basalts are the common mafic rocks in this type of VMS deposit, \n\nhowever there are exceptions like in the Iberian Pyrite Belt where alkaline basalts are found in higher \n\nlevels of the stratigraphic sequence. The \u201cbimodal-silicic lastic\u201d VMS deposits have the lowest contents \n\nin Cu and the highest in Pb, but are the largest in size in comparison with all the remaining VMS types \n\n(Barrie and Hannington, 1999). \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n2.2.1 Ophiolite-Hosted Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide Deposits \n\nOphiolite-hosted VMS deposits are \u201cmafic type\u201d deposits, also commonly referred as Cyprus type, \n\nnormally displaying a shape similar to those modern analogues found in massive sulphide mounds. They \n\noften display an elongated shape instead of equidimensional, reflecting the strong structural control set \n\nby fault zones in hydrothermal-mineralising venting. The footwall contact has usually a concave shape, \n\nwhile the hanging wall is flat, outlining a long-term exposure on the seafloor that tends to flatten the \n\nupper surface of the massive sulphide deposit. The massive sulphide lens formed along half grabens or \n\nadjoining listric fault zones are usually thicker in one flank and thinner towards their width. The lens  \n\ncomprises breccia and pyrite sands, covered by Fe-rich oxidized sediments (ochres) (Galley &amp; Koski, \n\n1997).  \n\nThe root of most of massive sulphide deposits goes tens of meters below the paleo seafloor where a \n\ndiscrete stockwork cuts the basaltic host rock and promotes the long-lived flow of hydrothermal(-\n\nmineralising) fluids responsible for the observed alteration halo (chlorite-quartz-pyrite). The sulphide  \n\nstockwork is composed of small and irregular, anastomosed veins/veinlets in a chlorite -quartz \n\ngroundmass (lower part) but, below the massive sulphide lens, the veins increase in size giving rise to \n\nin situ breccias. Recurrent rejuvenation of permeability, due to cyclic build-up of fluid pressure, \n\npromotes the development of spaces than can be filled with sulphides, forming small massive sulphide  \n\nlenses. In the upper stockwork, basalts are silicified whereas at the base of some ore lenses sulphide-\n\nquartz breccias may develop (Galley &amp; Koski, 1999). \n\nThere is a gradual contact (several meters) between the stratiform massive sulphide lens and the top of \n\nthe stockwork, where the veins coalesce to form the massive sulphide lens leaving altered basalt \n\nfragments isolated and almost indistinct towards the core of the lens. Those orebodies are normally \n\nmassive, made up of fine-grained granoblastic to idiomorphic pyrite, with abundant vuggy cavities line d \n\nby idiomorphic pyrite. Veins of colloform to sandy sulphides cut the massive sulphide that appears more \n\nbrecciated upwards. The blocks (cemented by \u201csandy\u201d sulphide) are normally colloform banded \n\nsulphide; however, some blocks of chalcopyrite aggregates are present in a matrix of pyrite and quartz. \n\nThese blocks might correspond to fragments of high temperature sulphide chimneys; some worm \n\nburrows (tube-worms) were identified indicating that some of the breccias might correspond to sulphide  \n\nchimneys. The sulphide lenses become less consolidated towards the top and are commonly covered by \n\nlayered Fe oxides sediments (ochres) composed of goethite, natro-jarosite, jarosite, hematite, maghemite  \n\nand magnetite; these sediments may include some interlayered graded beds of \u201cdetrital\u201d sulphide and \n\ntend to be confined to direct contact with the massive sulphide lenses whereas jaspers (commonly \n\nradiolarian-bearing) are not so restrict. The jaspers are thought to be formed from pelagic and \n\nhydrothermal chemical-sediments while ochres from in situ weathering of the underlying sulphide , \n\nalthough some authors suggest that this type of Fe-oxide deposits are formed from subaerial weathering \n\n(Galley &amp; Koski, 1999). \n\nPyrite is the main sulphide mineral in this type of ores, being chalcopyrite and sphalerite the second \n\nmost abundant sulphide minerals. These deposits can also include marcasite, cubanite, covellite, bornite , \n\ndigenite, chalcocite, galena, pyrrhotite, idaite, bravoite, carollite, and mackinawite, with minor amounts  \n\nof magnetite and hematite. The most common gangue components are quartz and gypsum. Referring to \n\nthe ochre caps, these include goethite, jarosite, amorphous oxides, hematite and rare native gold. The \n\nveining system of the stockwork consists mainly of pyrite and quartz-pyrite, being the pyrite present in \n\ndisseminations throughout the chloritized and silicified host lavas; it is in these silicified zones that the \n\nchalcopyrite veins are mostly concentrated. Pyrite in pyrite veins are commonly fine-graine d \n\ngranoblastic to idiomorphic (with small amounts of chalcopyrite and sphalerite forming inclusions and \n\nfracture infillings) while in quartz-pyrite veins, the sulphide is usually corroded and replaced by quartz \n\n\n\n2. Geological Setting \n\n11 \n \n\nand/or chalcedonic silica, being the latter more common at the top of the stockwork. In general, the \n\nmineral assemblage forming the base of the lens is pyrite-silica breccia, where pyrite and chalcopyrite  \n\nare surrounded and partially replaced by silica. On top, a massive pyrite facies of fine -graine d \n\n(idiomorphic to subhedral) pyrite; this pyrite is commonly zoned, with inclusions of pyrrhotite , \n\nchalcopyrite, magnetite, cubanite and Fe-rich sphalerite (Galley &amp; Koski, 1999). Colloform banded \n\nveins commonly cut the base of the massive pyrite, although these colloform textures are more abundant \n\nin the breccia zone. The colloform veins and rims are composed of interlayered pyrite, marcasite, \n\nchalcopyrite, sphalerite, and quartz, where chalcopyrite veining increases towards the top of the lens. \n\nCovellite, chalcocite and digenite are secondary copper minerals and are mostly present below the Fe \n\noxide ochre cap, although they can be found in the entire orebody replacing chalcopyrite (Galley &amp; \n\nKoski, 1999). \n\n2.2.2 VMS Deposits in Oman \n\nVolcanogenic massive sulphide deposits are mostly found in the northern part of the Oman Mountains , \n\nwithin the volcanic lavas sequence. Early evidence of mining is from the Bronze Age and Islam rise, \n\nmostly focused on secondary copper minerals found below strongly oxidised (superficial) caps (Lippard \n\net al., 1986). Lasail, Bayda and Aarja in the Sohar district were the first mines where primary \n\nchalcopyrite-bearing massive sulphides were exploited between 1983 and 1993; Lasail was the largest \n\ndeposit, producing 9.2 Mt of ore at 1.42 wt% copper. From 1994 to 2005, the iron-hats of Yanqul were \n\nmined for gold, but since 2000 many important discoveries have been made, and Hatta, Shinas, Safwa \n\nand Mandoos were mined by Mawarid Mining L.L.C. \n\n \n\nFig 2. 6 \u2013 Simplified geological map displaying the location of a large number of deposits within the volcanic units \n\nrepresented as in figure 2.1. \n\nThe 50 Mt total tonnage of the Sumail deposits are not comparable with other VMS districts around the \n\nworld (Franklin et al., 2005) but is in the same range indicated for the Troodos ophiolite VMS deposits.  \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nThe Geotimes/Lasail contact and to a lesser extent the Geotimes/Alley contact were thought to be the \n\nmain ore horizons, corresponding to the paleo-seafloor where the sulphide mounds were formed; \n\nhowever, some of the later discoveries do not fit this simplified model of occurrence (Gilgen et al, 2014).   \n\n2.2.3 The Mandoos Deposit  \n\nThere are no published data about the Mandoos 1 deposit, and the following information was gathered \n\nfrom a Mawarid Mining unpublished report. The Mandoos area (Fig 2.7), more specifically the Mandoos  \n\n1 deposit area, is covered by unconsolidated wadi gravels (8 to 34 m) and there are no signs of volcanic  \n\nrocks exposures; they only occur 2 km along strike to the north and south, and indications provided by \n\nthe regional geological mapping show that the volcanic sequence dips to the east. The Mandoos 1 ores \n\noccur intra-Lasail or Alley volcanic units, although the relatively high magnetisation of the host rock \n\nfavours the latter unit. Such differences in magnetic properties of the two volcanic units derive from the \n\nrelative amount of igneous iron-oxides in the lavas, thus providing characteristic magnetic signals. The \n\ngeology of the deposit was inferred from drill-holes and logging, showing that the massive sulphide in \n\nthe Mandoos 1 prospect spreads over 60 m thick in the northern part, which is interpreted as an evidence \n\nof a topographic-low or an asymmetric-graben infilling; a strong structural control of ore deposition and \n\naccumulation is suggested due to the significant thickness decrease of the lens towards north, east and \n\nwest.  \n\n \n\nFig 2. 7 \u2013 Location of Mandoos 1 open pit (ArcGIS). \n\nThe massive sulphide lens (Fig 2.8) is hosted in massive basaltic lavas with some minor pillow lavas \n\noccurring on its footwall.

A gossanous zone is also present where the lens was exposed to weathering, mostly \n\nin the transition from the mineralised volcanic rock and the unconsolidated wadi gravels. \n\nAs in most of the ophiolite-hosted deposits, pyrite is the dominant sulphide in Mandoos 1 deposit, with \n\nminor chalcopyrite and sphalerite. Chalcopyrite normally concentrates in the upper levels of the mas sive \n\nsulphide lens, and the higher copper grades together with some anomalous contents of Au, Ag and Zn \n\noutline the transition zone towards the iron-hat cover, strongly suggesting the progression of late \n\n(supergene?) enrichment processes. In the footwall of the lens there is a clay-silica-pyrite alteration \n\nzone, which appears to be more extensive towards the north and west and thin towards the south. The \n\nore in this deposit can be subdivided in three types: (i) the massive sulphide zone that comprises more \n\nthan 90% pyrite and late-formed chalcopyrite; (ii) the silica massive sulphide zone that occurs only in \n\nshort (and discontinuous) intersections; and (iii) the stockwork hosted in a silica-clay altered basalt \n\nplaced below the central part of the lens and showing a pyrite-quartz-jasper association, usually poor in \n\ncopper. \n\nMany different diachronic alteration events are recorded. Hematite-rich alteration is preserved in basalts \n\nshowing also evidence of carbonate alteration as veinlet infillings preceding the main mineralising event. \n\nAs referred before, the transition zone between the massive sulphide lens and the gossan cover is where \n\nthe higher grades of copper are found; that enrichment is mostly due to the alteration of chalcopyrite to \n\nchalcocite, bornite and covellite. Synchronous with the massive sulphide formation a chlorite (+quartz) \n\nalteration occurs and is best seen along the \u201cchilled margins\u201d in pillow lavas. \n\n \n\nFig 2. 8 \u2013 Cross-section of the ore body showing the relative position of the stockwork and the gossan cover (Mawarid \n\nMining, 2014). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3. Methodologies \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n3. Methodology \n \n\n3.1 Sampling \n\nThe sampling survey comprised two different phases. The first one took place throughout the east-wall \n\nof the Mandoos Mine open pit, granted to the Mawarid Mining Company; the second phase involve d \n\nsix drill-cores provided by the same company, after their previous re-logging. \n\nThe sample labelling distinguishes the survey phase. Samples from the open pit were labelled with MD, \n\ninitials for Mandoos, followed by the profile reference (P1, P2, P3 and P4) and sample number. Labels \n\nof drill-core samples comprise the original reference given to drill holes and the depth where the sample \n\nwas collected, besides the MD initials. \n\nThe first sampling phase was performed by Dr. Ana Jesus in May 2015 and includes samples from the \n\nmassive sulphide orebody and metalliferous sediments. This discrete sampling programme along the \n\neast-wall of the open pit (from the central part of the deposit towards south) allowed collecting 24 \n\nspecimens (Appendix I). \n\n \n\nFig 3. 1 \u2013 First sampling survey along the open pit east wall, illustrating the location of the 4 sampled profiles and some \n\nother collected samples. \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nThe second phase of the sampling survey was performed in March, 2016. The selected six drill holes  \n\nare not restricted to the ore body exposed in open pit, and embrace outskirt domains of the mineralise d \n\narea as illustrated in Figure 3.2. According to the available data, cores from drill hole MD174 should \n\nrepresent the north-western part of the ore body, while those from MD150 and MD178 should \n\ncharacterise its central domain; samples from MD429, MD430 and MD431 drill holes represent the \n\nsouth-estern part of the deposit, outside the open pit. The sampling programme wa s targeted to \n\nintersected segments of the ore lens, embracing cores of massive sulphide segments, mineralised jaspers \n\nand metalliferous sediments (umbers and ochres). Due to the poor core preservation, the spatial \n\nrepresentativeness of sampling might be compromised in certain parts of the section; indeed, the \n\nmajority of ore segments in drill holes display evidence of significant crumbling and/or variable  \n\nmingling, or show effects of strong weathering, being covered by sulphate crusts of irregular thickness . \n\nThe best approach was to collect all the well-preserved and less-altered specimens throughout the six \n\ndrill cores, totalling 18 samples and resulting in a combined collection of 42 samples: 27 of massive \n\nsulphides, 6 of mineralised jaspers, 5 of metalliferous sediments and 4 of a mineralised silicified basalt.  \n\n \n\nFig 3. 2 \u2013 Drill holes location at Mandoos 1; the red mark represents the drill holes sampled in this work (second survey); \n\ninformation from drill holes marked with the reference was used in the modelling exercise.

Methodologies \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n3.2 Sample Preparation \n\nSample preparation took place between May and September, 2016, using the facilities available at the \n\nSultan Qaboos University (SQU) and the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL). The \n\nfirst steps of sample preparation were made in SQU due to the impossibility to e xport rock samples out \n\nof Oman. \n\n3.2.1 Thin and Polished Sections Preparation \n\nA large number of polished thin sections and mounts were made, according the usual procedures, as \n\nfollows: \n\na) The samples were cut with a diamond saw considering the surface chosen for further \n\npetrographic analysis; the slabs should get the size to fit the glass for thin sections, or to fit the \n\nmounts cup. \n\nb) Mount samples were placed into cups, further filled with epoxy resin and then placed into a \n\nvacuum chamber hoven for resin settling. \n\nc) To prepare thin sections, the slabs were glued onto unpolished glasses; slab surfaces were \n\npreviously flattened in an automatic plate using 600 mesh silicon carbide powder. After being \n\nglued, the samples rested in a heated press for resin settling. \n\nd) All the thin section samples were trimmed with a diamond precision saw, and only about 0.5mm \n\nthick of rock was left glued on the glass. \n\ne) The lapping is one of the critical steps to get good results before polishing, and this process \n\ndiffers for thin sections or mounts. For thin sections the mechanism is completely automatic but \n\nthe good results will depend on the good calibration of the machine. The samples were placed \n\non a jig and the lapping was done in a plate using 600 mesh silicon carbide powder until the \n\nthickness of a bit more than 30 ?m was reached. The lapping of the mounts was completely \n\nhandmade, involving a sequence of steps to decrease the grid size and to get the best surface to \n\npolish. It started with a 220 mesh diamond plate followed by the 600 mesh diamond plate. After \n\nthe diamond plate the samples were lapped on a glass surface using silicon carbide powder, \n\nstarting with 800, then 1000 and finally 1200 mesh.  \n\nf) The other critical step is the polishing; it was done automatically but, like the lapping, a precise \n\ncalibration was critical for good results. Both sample types, thin sections and mounts, were \n\npolished using the same method. They were polished using a cloth plate impregnated with \n\ndiamond paste and lubricant. A series of different grain size diamond paste were used, starting \nwith 14 ?m (only for thin sections), 6 ?m, 3 ?m and finishing with 1 ?m. \n\n3.2.2 Powders for Whole-rock Multi-element Analysis \n\nAll the samples selected for whole-rock geochemistry were identically processed following the common \n\napproach; i.e.: \n\na) The samples were cut in thin slabs using a diamond saw. \n\nb) The surfaces of all slabs were smoothed with emery to remove traces of ink, weathering and \n\ncontamination from the saw blade. \n\nc) The size reduction of slabs was made by hammering the samples wrapped in white paper, to \n\navoid contact with the hammer and the metal base. \n\nd) When necessary, a Cr-hardened steel roll mill was used for size reduction of samples; this step \n\nwas only used when hammering was not enough to reduce the sample to the desired size. \n\ne) Powdering of all samples using an agate ring mill anytime the sample weight was between 100 \n\nand 120 gr; when that weight of sample was not achieved, a smaller agate ball mill was used \ninstead. \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nThe rock powders obtained through this process were also used to produce pressed-powder pellets for \n\nXRF. \n\n3.3 Analytical Procedures and Conditions \n\n3.3.1 XRD \n\nXRD analyses were performed in some samples to complement petrography whenever microscopy did  \n\nnot allow to clearly identify some mineral phases. The samples (a fine powder) were prepared at SQU \n\nfacilities and placed on a spinning single-crystal silicon sample holder. The XRD record, measured at a \n\nstep size of 0.0167\u00b0 (2?), was acquired with a X' Pert PRO X-ray Diffraction machine from Panalytical \n\nthat used a Cu-K? radiation (1.54060 \u00c5) and was set to 40 mA and 45 kV. The data was further assessed \n\nwith the \u201cHigh Score Plus\u201d software.  \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Portable EDXRF  \n\nDuring re-logging and sampling, a portable XRF was used at SQU facilities, as an auxiliary tool during \n\nmacroscopic sample characterisation. A Niton XL3t 950 Handheld XRF Analyzer (Thermo Scientific ), \n\ncalibrated with laboratory test standards and equipped with a SDD GOLDD+ detector and a Ag anode \n\nX-ray tube (excitation voltage 50 kV, 200 mA, 2 Watt), was used in such approach. The instrument self-\n\ncalibrates on an internal standard whenever the machine is switched on. No sample preparation is  \n\nrequired since the beam is shot directly onto the sample area to be analysed.   \n\n        \n\n3.3.3 Whole Rock WDXRF  \n\nOne alternative to get WDXRF data consists of prepare in advance powdered samples with a flat surface. \n\nThe preparation of pressed-powder pellets involved the following steps: \n\na) One pellet requires 12 g of rock powder, being that the average weight measured for all samples.  \nb) In a mortar, the sample was mixed with a mixture of acetone and elvacite (polymer), carefully \n\nmixed until reaching total homogenisation. \nc) The sample holder was placed in a press, and the sample placed in the holder with a tube and a \n\ncylinder to slightly press it. \nd) A perfect flat lid is placed onto the sample and pressure is slowly applied, allowing time for the \n\nvolatiles to escape and the polymer to settle. This procedure is done twice after carefully rotating \nthe sample holder for another position. \n\nAll measurements were carried at the Aveiro University facilities using an Axios equipment from \nPanalytical with a rhodium ampoule. The analytical error for major elements is 2% of the measured \n\nvalue, while minor and trace elements detection limits are available  in Appendix II. \n\n3.3.4 Whole Rock ICP-MS \n\nThe acquisition of minor and trace elements took place at the G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulous e  \n\nlaboratory (Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es), Universit\u00e9 of Toulouse III, via HR-ICP-MS ELEMENT XR \n\nand using the procedure described by Barrat et al. (2007). A HF-HClO4 digestion (Yokoyama et al., \n\n1999) with Tm addition (Barrat et al., 1996) was used to prepare the samples. After the acid digestion, \n\nthe samples were diluted and analysed to obtain all minor and trace element concentrations. Analytica l \n\nblanks were subtracted to BHVO2 and samples cps; so, if the blank is higher than the signal, the \n\ncalculated concentration is negative and cancelled. Instrumental detection limits, analytical and total \n\nprocedural blanks can be consulted in Appendix III. \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Methodologies \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n3.3.5 Electron Probe Micro Analysis \n\nAll mineral chemistry analyses were produced on polished mounts covered by a thin carbon coating (20 \n\nnm) at FCUL facilities. The instrument used in this stage was a JEOL-JXA 8200 Micro Probe, equipped \n\nwith four wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS), six analysing crystals (LIF, LIFH, PET, PETH, \n\nTAP and LDED2) and secondary and retro-diffused electron detectors coupled to an energy-dispersive \n\nspectrometer (EDS). The measurements were performed with a 5 \u00b5m diameter beam, a 25 nA current \n\nand an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. In routine, the acquisition time for peaks was 20 s and 5 s for \n\nbackground radiation. The standards used and the detection limits for all measured elements are listed \n\nin Appendix IV and Appendix V, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 4. Model for the Mandoos 1 Deposit \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n4. Model for the Mandoos 1 Deposit \n\n4.1 The Tridimensional Modelling of Mandoos 1 Deposit \n\nThe 3D model of the Mandoos 1 deposit was built using the data provided by Mawarid Mining and the \n\nMICROMINE software. The starting database includes data from 33 drill-holes (see figure 3.2): 29 \n\nalong the pit zone, one located 1 km north from the pit, and the last three placed 250 m SE from the pit \n\n(the last drill-holes were performed during one of the latest exploration surveys done by the company). \n\nThe 29 drill-holes are distributed in a regular 50 m x 50 m square grid.  \n\nThe data were organised in collar, survey, assay and lithology. Collar data includes geographica l \n\ncoordinates, altitude and drill-hole length (DHL), besides the bore-hole ID (BHID). Survey data includes \n\ndepth, azimuth and dip values. Assay data comprise concentration values of Cu, Zn and Fe in weight \n\npercentage (wt%) and Au and Ag in parts per million (ppm) linked to a particular depth. The lithology \n\ndata includes the depth where a given lithology intersected by drill-hole starts and ends, and the \n\nlithological information. The Mawarid Mining also provided STRING files containing the pit design \n\nand sections of the ore-body. \n\nThis complete database is essential to build the 3D model, and its organisation is a key factor to easily \n\ninsert the data on MICROMINE. Collar and survey data will allow placing the drill-holes, while assay \n\nand lithology data will let assigning grades and lithology along them. The STRING file for the pit design \n\nwas used to model the shape of the pit and site; a digital landscape model (DTM) was created from the \n\npit design file in addition with a geo-referenced image of the site extracted from Google Earth. In \n\naddition, the STRING file with the sections of the ore-body allowed to locating the orebody using not \n\nonly the information gathered from the 33 drill-holes, but also from all the drills done by the company \n\nin the Mandoos 1 deposit.  \n\n \n\nFig 4. 1 - Pit design with implanted drill cores and the orebody extension. \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nFigure 4.1 illustrates the N-S aligned pit, with 620 m length and 390 m width; its depth increases towards \n\nsouth where it reaches 160 m, 60 m more than the deepest part of the north sector. The massive sulphide \n\nbody has 550 m long and up to 370 wide; the average width is around 200 m. The massive sulphide lens  \n\nvaries in thickness from less than 1 m to a maximum of 90 m recorded in the northern sector of the \n\ndeposit. The lens shows also a general NW-SE elongation dipping moderately towards SE. \n\n4.1 Grades and Tonnage \n\nUsing the implicit modelling tool from MICROMINE, which uses simple kriging as the interpolation \n\nmethod, it was possible to model the Cu and Zn grades in the orebody. The buffer used in the \n\ninterpolation was 75 m, i.e.1.5 x the spacing between drills (50 m). Also, a colour code was given to the \n\nelements, red was used for Cu while blue was assigned to Zn. A colour grading, from light to dark \n\ncolours, represents lower and higher grades. The limits used to define the cut-off grade for the colour \n\ncoding were the minimum, first quartile, median and third quartile; however all analyses below the mine  \n\ncut-off grade (0.3 wt% Cu) were previously excluded. \n\nFig 4.3 displays Cu and Zn grades distribution along the deposit, respectively; image (A) in both figures  \n\nrepresents the higher grades with a cut-off defined by the third quartile of the concentration distributions , \n\ni.e. 2.44 wt% for Cu and 0.44 wt% for Zn. It is worth noting that the south sector is the most enriched \n\nin these elements, more precisely in section 2732850mN (drill-hole MD150 \u2013 Fig 3.2) where the two \n\nelements are largely overlapped, suggesting the lacking of significant metal zonation. The central sector \n\nof the deposit also shows Cu- and Zn-enriched zones (Section 2733000mN \u2013 Fig 3.2), but in this case \n\nan evident separation exists: a Cu-rich zone (MD071) to the east and a Zn-rich zone to the west \n\n(MD020). Along the two drill-holes that crosscut these two distinct zones there is no firm evidence for \n\nmetal zonation, as can be seen in the sections in Appendix VI. The same can also be inferred from the \n\nNW-SE cross section along the lens alignment (see Fig 3.2), Fig 4.4 and Fig 4.5 show the Cu and Zn \n\nvariations, respectively, along the ore body. As can be seen, the overlapping of Cu-rich and Zn-rich \n\nzones is recorded all over the entire lens. It is also clear that the north sector of the deposit is where the \n\nhighest thickness of the ore-body is observed (Fig 4.6); however, this thick accumulation of sulphide s  \n\ndo not display the highest grades. Due to the ore lens morphology and some evidence for NW-SE (to \n\nN-S?) fault zones, this thicker domain of the ore-body is interpreted as a hemi-graben filled with massive \n\nsulphides (Fig. 4.2).   \n\n \n\nFig 4. 2 \u2013 North sector fracture network and massive sulphide lens E-W cross-section showing the fault-related \n\ndisplacements consistent with a hemi-graben morphology. \n\n40m \n\n\n\n 4.

Model for the Mandoos 1 Deposit \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nThe Mawarid\u2019s engineers assessed in Mandoos 1 a total resource of about 8 Mt of Cu-rich massive \n\nsulphide ore (mine cut-off grade = 0.3 wt% Cu), including ca. 5 Mt in reserves with 1.8 wt% Cu \n\n(Mawarid Mining, 2014; Rob Willis, pers. com. to Ana Jesus, February, 2015). The orebody (Fig 4.6) \n\nvolume calculation revealed a total value of 1.8 M m3. Assuming a typical composition of about 80% \n\npyrite, 12% quartz, 5% chalcopyrite and 2% of sphalerite, and knowing that the respective densities are \n\n4.8 g/cm3, 2.65 g/cm3, 4.1 g/cm3 and 3.9 g/cm3, the massive sulphide lens comes out with an average \n\ndensity of 4.44 g/cm3 and total tonnage of 7.99 Mt. The average grade of 1.8 wt% Cu reported by the \n\ncompany is also obtained by a simple mean calculation of all Cu values above the mine cut-off grade; \n\nhowever when weighted, the average grade drops to 1.72 wt% Cu.  \n\n \n\nFig 4. 6 - NW-SE section of the Mandoos massive sulphide lens. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5. Petrography \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n5. Petrography \nThe present section of the work summarises the main mineralogical and textural features displayed by \n\nsulphide ores (including mineralised basalts), metalliferous sediments (umber and ochres) and jaspers \n\n(massive sulphide mineralised jaspers and manganese jasper) at microscale, using reflected and \n\ntransmitted light microscopy. Complementary EPMA information and additional macroscopic (hand \n\nsample) evidence will also be locally included. \n\n5.1 Sulphide Ores \n\nSamples of massive sulphides s.s. are not common in this deposit. Actually, throughout all the sampling \n\nsurvey there was no evidence of real massive sulphides; the ores normally occur as heterometric breccias \n\n(Fig. 5.1).  Texturally, these breccias are quite regular, with the exception of some cases comprising \n\nfragments that display wider textural diversity. The presence of pyritised (transversal and longitudina l) \n\ncross-sections of tubeworms (polychetae) is worth noting (Fig. 5.2 \u2013 1, 2), placing the examined samples \n\nin the black-smokers environment (MD-P2-3-2). A large number of samples consist of poorly calibrated \n\nbreccias mainly composed of pyrite clasts (Fig. 5.1). Their formation is possibly a result of successive \n\nmass-wasting events occurring at the sea-mounds. The clasts can vary from small, single, fractured, \n\n(sub)euhedral grains to large fragments of massive aggregates. These can differ in composition or in \n\ntexture, pyrite being the most common example. \n\nSamples from \u201cmassive sulphide ores\u201d show a monotonous mineral assemblage, comprising a small \n\nnumber of different mineral phases. They are mainly composed of re crystallised pyrite, having \n\nchalcopyrite, marcasite and sphalerite as common accessory minerals; Cu-rich phases are also present \n\nin some samples and quartz, laumontite and phyllosilicates are the usual gangue-forming phases. \n\nPrimary textures are common among the clasts: round to long colloform clasts (Fig. 5.2 - 4, 5, 6, 7) and \n\nframboidal masses (Fig. 5.3 \u2013 3) are seen throughout the breccias, usually associated with chalcopyrite , \n\noccurring as replacements of former pyrite grains. Often recrystallised, the cores of pyrite aggregates \n\nalso preserve primary textures such as framboidal and colloform; wherever these clasts do not show \n\npreserved primary textures, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the re crystallised and a second \n\ngeneration of pyrite.  All these structures appear to be replaced or filled by chalcopyrite \u00b1 bornite \u00b1 Cu-\n\nrich phases; usually, the alteration starts at the crystal borders and creates a Cu-rich ramification \n\nstructure that sometimes partly obliterates all the primary texture (Fig. 5.3 \u2013 7). Clasts, presumably \n\nrelated to hydraulic brecciation, are also frequent and these can vary in size, but normally are coarse-\n\nsized clasts composed mostly of recrystallised pyrite, crisscrossed by a network of late quartz-veins \n\nshowing a jigsaw fit texture, being the surroundings of the veins more recrystallised. \n\nPyrite clasts (varying from euhedral crystals to large masses) are typical, but marcasite, chalcopyrite and \n\nsphalerite clasts can also be seen. Pyrite shows distinct occurrence modes, being the most common as \n\neuhedral recrystallised masses where a growth zonation (or banding) is evident, usually decorated by \n\nsmall inclusions of sphalerite (Fig. 5.2 \u2013 8) and rarely by chalcopyrite inclusions. The growth zonation \n\nis often traced by alternation between well-recrystallised pyrite and porous pyrite. In some samples, \n\neuhedral pyrite displays vuggy arrangements. Marcasite can be seen more rarely as coarse euhedral grain \n\nmasses (Fig. 5.3 \u2013 2), displaying colloform textures and more often as masses (usually surrounded by \n\npyrite) partly replaced by chalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite occurs as large masses, being replaced by bornite  \n\nand other Cu-rich phases, and as clear masses/crystals with sphalerite inclusions. \n\nSome samples show a platy chalcopyrite in quartz and phyllosilicates veins and it can also be observed \n\nin crack-infillings affecting pyrite. Usually the cement of these breccias comprise quartz and \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\nphyllossilicates, or a mixture of quartz and small pyrite grains (\u201cpyrite sands\u201d); nevertheless laumontite  \n\nalso occurs, often as an accessory phase in the cement and as part of the mineral infillings of open spaces \n\nin large masses of pyrite and chalcopyrite. \n\nThe sample MD-P3-4-1 is an exception, displaying a carbonate cement. Similarly, the sample MD-NP-\n\n1 is characterised by a particular texture, where large sphalerite masses containing numerous oriented \n\nchalcopyrite (triangular) inclusions can be interpreted as a primary texture (Fig. 5.3 - 5), by analogy to \n\nwhat is commonly displayed by black-smokers. The sphalerite masses are inter-grown/filled with \n\nlaumontite and is locally replaced by bornite, as happens with co-existent chalcopyrite. The Zn-rich \n\nzone contacts with a Cu-rich zone, where some sphalerite can be seen replaced by chalcopyrite (?). In \n\nthese samples, some of the chalcopyrite masses are also inter-grown with laumontite; these late infillings  \n\nalso contain pyrite, marcasite and fine-grained sphalerite. The MD-NP-1 sample also includes skeletal \n\nwurtzite (paramorphic sphalerite) infilled/altered by iron sulphides taking advantage of the space \n\nbetween crystals. Platy crystals of wurtzite forming well-developed elongated prismatic aggregates \n\ncrystallised in open spaces (infilled with laumontite) can also be locally observed (Fig. 5.3 \u2013 4). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 5. 1 - Hand Samples: A \u2013 MD-NP-1 \u2013 Zn-rich ore, sphalerite and chalcopyrite rich ore with late laumontite infillings; B \n\u2013 MD-P3-4-1 \u2013 massive sulphide breccia mainly composed of pyrite clasts cemented by carbonates; C \u2013 MD-P2-3-2 \u2013 massive \n\nsulphide breccia cemented by silica and phyllosilicates, characterised by preserved primary textures, including pyritised  \n\ntubeworms; D - MD178-128.80 \u2013 massive sulphide breccia cemented by silica and crosscut by large sphalerite rich vein; E, \n\nF, G, H \u2013 samples of massive sulphide breccias displaying a silica rich cement.

Mineralised veins are seen crosscutting the basalts. Adjoining their walls, pyrite  \n\ndissemination is more intense and coarser-grained, whereas minor amounts of chalcopyrite can also be \n\npresent. The infillings of these veins include a mineral assemblage composed of coarse -grained euhedral \n\npyrite crystals encased by large masses of chalcopyrite with scarce sphalerite inclusions  (Fig. 5.4 \u2013 3). \n\nSphalerite is seen as inclusions in both pyrite and chalcopyrite; this sphalerite can show effects of \n\n\u201cchalcopyrite disease\u201d and is characterised by low Fe-contents. Some late-deposited quartz and \n\nphyllosilicate rich vein infillings (? poorly polished surface mineral) crosscut chalcopyrite masses; these \n\nalso carry some pyrite and sphalerite. A second generation of sphalerite is characterised by lighte r \n\ninternal reflections, indicating lower Fe-contents (presumably developed under lower temperature \n\nconditions); the zinc was possibly released during the sphalerite replacement by chalcopyrite and lately \n\nincorporated in the quartz rich veins. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 5. 4 \u2013 Hand Samples - MD430-131.00 (A) and MD430-127.70 (B) \u2013 Silicified basalt displaying sulphide disseminations \n\nand sulphide veins.

The first one shows a clear \n\nsedimentary texture composed of a rhythmic fine-grained banding of Fe-oxide poor to Fe-oxide enriched \n\nsediments (Fig. 5.5 F), the latter being more abundant and thicker. In these layers, the Fe-oxide grains  \n\ntend to develop clusters with ellipsoidal shapes (Fig. 5.6 \u2013 2) whose minor axes are sub-perpendicula r \n\nto the layering (indicating some compression, conceivably related to sedimentation and diagenesis  \n\nprocesses). The sample also displays two different types of carbonate veins, one perpendicular to the \n\nlayering, with no evidence of mineralization, and a later set of veins showing comb-texture (Fig. 5.6 \u2013 \n\n1) with accessory amounts of sulphides (chalcopyrite and Cu-rich phases? in Fig. 5.6 - 7). There is no \n\nother evidence of sulphide minerals or clasts. Sample (MD178-134.20) also shows a sedimentary \n\ntexture, but in this case the alternation of layers is between Fe-oxide rich (jasper like) and sulphide-ric h \n\nsediments (Fig. 5.5 E), the latter mainly composed of pyrite and chalcopyrite but also containing small \n\namounts of sphalerite and covellite. \n\nPyrite occurs in different textural arrangements, mostly forming fine-grained masses (resulting in a \n\n\u201cdirty-looking\u201d polished surface), but it can occur as well as sub-euhedral grains of variable size  \n\n(resulting in a \u201cclean\u201d polished surface). The massive pyrite borders sometimes show some \n\nrecrystallisation (?) and these massive aggregates may preserve some colloform texture s. As previously \n\nreferred, ochre sediments may include some interlayered graded beds of \u201cdetrital\u201d sulphide s and tend to \n\nbe confined to the contact with the massive sulphide lenses, as observed in this sample. A clear contact \n\nbetween massive sulphides and the layered Fe-rich sediment with sulphide rich intercalations also shows \n\na sphalerite infilling (vein/space??); it is characterised by very fine intergrowths of sub-euhedral \n\nsphalerite grains, quartz(?) and some covellite. The third type (MD174-62.15) shows a completely \n\ndifferent texture: a coarse-grained breccia impregnated and cemented by Fe-oxides and criptocrystalline  \n\nsilica (Fig. 5.5 C); the clasts are also replaced by Fe-(hydr)oxides and hydroxides, mostly hematite and \n\ngoethite. The observed texture is easily correlated with the massive sulphide breccias, where euhedral \n\naltered pyrite clasts (Fig. 5.6 \u2013 6, 7), along with colloform (Fig. 5.6 \u2013 8) and framboidal pyrite clasts, \n\ncan still be recognized as pseudomorphs. Some sulphides are still preserved in few mineral cores, \n\nnamely chalcopyrite being replaced by bornite and other Cu rich phases (Fig. 5.6 \u2013 3, 4).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 5. 5 \u2013 Hand Samples \u2013 A \u2013 MD-P2-2B \u2013 Ochre; B \u2013 Umber; C \u2013 MD174-62.15 - Oxidised massive sulphides; D \u2013 Massive \n\nsulphide mineralised jasper; E - MD178-134.20 \u2013 Ochre displaying sulphide layers close to the contact with the massive \n\nsulphide lens; F \u2013 MD-P2-2A - Layered ochre.

Petrography \n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n5.4 Jaspers  \n\nThe examined jaspers are always mineralised, as disseminations or vein infillings , particularly when in \ndirect contact with massive sulphides. Disseminations of pyrite are common, developing aggregates of \nsmall anhedral grains and, most often, aggregates of euhedral crystals of variable size, possibly \nrepresenting recrystallised grains (Fig. 5.7 \u2013 1). An intermediate stage between these two occurrence \nmodes is possibly represented by larger anhedral pyrite aggregates. Scarce chalcopyrite intergrowths  \nwith sphalerite displaying effects of \u201cchalcopyrite disease\u201d (secondary exsolution) are also disseminate d \nbut mostly associated with the anhedral pyrite aggregates. This chalcopyrite is loc ally replaced by \nbornite and covellite, suggesting a less reducing environment. Both euhedral pyrite and the aggregates \nhave sphalerite inclusions. Two different sphalerite inclusions can be seen: clear sphalerite (more \n\ncommon) and sphalerite with chalcopyrite segregations.  \n\nIt is also noticeable a grain size increase towards the massive sulphide veins; also, the grains become \nmore euhedral. The veins show a Fe-leached rim and are composed of large euhedral to sub-euhedral \ncrystals of pyrite encased in large masses of chalcopyrite, accompanied by quartz (Fig. 5.7 \u2013 5, 6). Some \npyrite grains show more \u201cclean\u201d and flat edges, contrasting with the core domains, which are more \nirregular, indicating the progression of recrystallisation processes. Chalcopyrite is usually seen filling \ncracks on the pyrite whereas there is evidence for scarce chalcopyrite inclusion in pyrite, mostly \nadjoining chalcopyrite masses. Besides the Fe-leached rims observed in the veins, other leached zones, \nwith no evidence of iron oxides are also seen throughout the samples. These are characterised by larger \npyrite crystals (Fig. 5.7 \u2013 2) and anhedral aggregates with a breccia texture; some sphalerite and \nchalcopyrite is also observed in this zone. The jasper impregnation by sulphides is possible due to \nincreasing porosity during leaching, leading also to the formation of veins and some collapse breccias  \n\n(Fig. 5.7 \u2013 3, 4), later silicified when the system temperature cools down. \n\nOne sample (MD-NP-3) shows a completely different mineralogy, being composed of cryptocrystalline  \nsilica inter-grown with manganese oxides; the sample also shows large euhedral pyrolusite crystals \n(diamond shape) and late veins possibly sealed by romanechite (according to its optical properties). In \nthe hand specimen it is evident the presence of jasper clasts within the manganese ore. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 5. 7 \u2013 Microphotography \u2013 1 \u2013 Fine-grained anhedral aggregates and euhedral Py disseminations in jasper \u2013 RL \u2013 PPL; \n\n2 \u2013 Py grain with jasper inclusions, displaying a leached rim \u2013 RL \u2013 XPL; 3 \u2013 Py breccia zone in contact with jasper having \n\ndisseminated Py \u2013 RL \u2013 PPL; 4 - Py breccia zone in contact with jasper including Py disseminations (as in microphoto 3) \u2013 RL \n\n\u2013 XPL; 5 - Sulphides associated with mineralised veins \u2013 RL \u2013 PPL; 6 - Sulphides associated with mineralised veins (as in \nmicrophoto 5) \u2013 RL \u2013 XPL; 7 \u2013 Disseminations in jasper, Ccp being altered by Cu-rich phases \u2013 RL \u2013 PPL; 8 -  Disseminations \n\nin jasper, Ccp being altered by Cu-rich phases (as in microphoto 7) \u2013 RL \u2013 XPL.

Mineral Chemistry \n \n\nSulphide phases forming the massive ores of Mandoos were the main focus of the work carried out using \n\nEPMA. Therefore, a comprehensive survey was prepared, covering different sulphides and textural \n\narrangements, and resulting in 946 quantitative analyses distributed over 15 polished mounts previous ly \n\nexamined under the reflected light microscope. The analytical dataset obtained include 310 analyses of \n\npyrite, 262 of chalcopyrite, 181 of sphalerite, 111 of marcasite, 64 of various Cu-rich phases, 13 of \n\nbornite and 5 of galena (Appendix VII for detection limits and Appendix VIII for analyses). \n\n6.1 Iron Sulphide Phases \n\nIron sulphides are by far the most abundant phases in the studied ore samples. Pyrite prevails and its  \n\ncomposition is close to ideal FeS2, with median composition of Fe0.999S2 and iron content scattered in \n\nthe 0.948-1.017 interval. Various elements are present in minor and trace amounts; the most significa nt \n\nare Cu, Zn and Pb, displaying highly asymmetric distributions typified by median values of 210 ppm, \n\n315 ppm, 180 ppm and contents up to 89780 ppm, 27890 ppm and 7070 ppm, respectively (Fig. 6.1). \n\nAlso worth mentioning is the presence of non-negligible amounts of As, In, Se and Co, characterised by \n\nmedian values of 70 ppm, 70 ppm, 90 ppm and 200 ppm respectively. \n\n \nFig 6. 1 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by 310 analyses of pyrite \n\n(concentration values in wt% ). Note the relative importance of Cu, Zn and Pb as minor elements. Traces of some other elements  \n\nare noteworthy, namely As, In, Se and Co (and Au?). \n\n \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nMarcasite composition is also close to ideal, with Fe0.949-1.017 and median composition of Fe0.997S2. It \n\ndisplays minor/trace amounts of Cu, Zn and Pb (like pyrite), which may reach 3820 ppm, 9800 ppm and \n\n3850 ppm, respectively (Fig. 6.2); the median values of the concentration distributions for these \n\nelements are BDL or quite close to that value (highlighting the strong distribution asymmetry), being \n\nthe third quartile equal to 1020 ppm, 320 ppm and 200 ppm respectively.  In addition, traces of Mn and \n\nCo are statistically meaningful, displaying median values of 70 ppm and 200 ppm, respectively. The last \n\ntwo elements are possibly accompanied by W, Te, In and Au, for which the calculated medians are BDL \n\n(third quartile = 428 ppm), 20 ppm, 60 ppm and 50 ppm. \n\n \nFig 6. 2 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by 111 analyses of marcasite \n(concentration values in wt% ). Note the relative importance of Cu, Zn and Pb as minor elements (like pyrite). Traces of Mn \n\nand Co also with statistical meaning. \n\nWhen plotted in a ternary diagram (Fig. 6.3), both pyrite and marcasite show similar behaviour , \n\nnotwithstanding the larger deviation displayed by pyrite analyses. The (S+As)\u2013Fe\u2013(Cu+In) diagram \n\nshows, as expected, a strong overlapping of the majority of samples in the FeS2 end-member field but \n\nwith a clear trend of Cu enrichment, in this case towards the chalcopyrite composition. The same trend \n\nis shown in the (S+As)\u2013(Zn+Cd+Co)\u2013(Cu+In) diagram, but it also points out an enrichment, although \n\nless significant, in Zn revealed by the compositional departure towards the sphalerite composition.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6.

In Figs 6.4 and 6.5, the textural arrangements where the \n\npyrite and marcasite analyses were obtained, are distinguished. Primary textures, such as framboidal and \n\ncolloform, and recrystallised masses or euhedral grains were individua lised. Despite some analyses \n\nmight be affected by crypto-exsolutions or crypto-inclusions (e.g. massive marcasite replaced by \n\nchalcopyrite \u2013 Fig 6.5), it is clear that Zn enrichments in pyrite or marcasite are mostly related to masses \n\nor individual grains; conversely, Cu enrichments are mainly observed in pyrite developing primary \n\ntextures (markedly framboids); this Cu-enrichment trend is not so clear in colloform marcasite.  \n\n \n\nFig 6. 4 - Bivariate diagram for textural discriminated pyrite analyses. \n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n6.0\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\n9.0\n\n10.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nIn\n+\n\nC\nu\n\n (\nw\n\nt%\n)\n\nCo+Cd+Zn (wt%)\n\nMassive/Euhedral\n\nColloform\n\nTube Worm\n\nFramboidal\n\nMassive w/  ccp exs ol\n\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\nS+As\n\n \n\n60\n\n50\n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 6. 5 - Bivariate diagram for textural discriminated marcasite analyses. \n\nSome colloform structures revealed rhythmic alternation between pyrite and a Cu-rich phase, probably \n\nbornite.

Clearly, \n\nthe most relevant  are the: (i) minor amounts of Zn, with median value of 920 ppm and maximum amount \n\nof 50290 ppm; and (ii) traces of Pb, Mo, In, Se and Co, displaying median values of 335 ppm, 335 ppm, \n\n60 ppm, 90 ppm and 100 ppm respectively. The incorporation of a variety of elements by chalcopyrite , \n\nand the existence of a great number of outliers, suggest that no compositional refinement is observed in \n\nthis mineral phase, also indicating that the development of chalcopyrite could be interpreted as a \n\ndecaying product of a previous Cu-rich phase and in \u201ctransition\u201d to other phases. \n\nBornite (Cu5FeS4) is also present, mostly replacing chalcopyrite. Its iron contents are less variable than \n\nthose of copper (Fe0.988-1.065 and Cu4.710-4.946) and a median composition of Fe1.005Cu4.849S4 can be \n\ncalculated on the basis of analyses compatible with the bornite stoichiometry. As in chalcopyrite, Zn \n\nand Pb are the most significant trace elements, with amounts ranging from 150 to 9060 ppm and up to \n\n1420 ppm, and median values of 1900 ppm and 880 ppm, respectively. The measured contents of Ag, \n\nMo and In are also non-negligible, reaching up to 520 ppm, 550 ppm and 790 ppm, with median values  \n\nof 150 ppm, 260 ppm and 130 ppm respectively (Fig 6.8). \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nMany other Cu-rich phases were analysed, optically undistinguishable under the current petrography.  \n\nThese were characterised and processed as a group of Cu-rich sulphides, separately from chalcopyrite \n\nand bornite. Variable in composition, these Cu-rich phases display copper contents from 22.359 to \n\n72.772 wt% (median = 53.250 wt%), and iron concentrations from 1.253 to 34.715 wt% (median = \n\n13.703 wt%); they also show significant amounts of Zn, up to 25 wt% (including an extreme outlie r), \n\ncharacterised by a median value of 4220 ppm. As can be seen in Fig 6.9, significant trace amounts of \n\nPb, Ag, Mo and Te were measured, displaying median values of 565 ppm, 215 ppm, 335 ppm and 435 \n\nppm, respectively, and maximum concentrations  up to 2930 ppm, 1330 ppm, 770 ppm and 73480 ppm, \n\nfollowing the very same order. \n\n \nFig 6. 8 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions (values in wt% ) displayed by 13 analyses of \n\nbornite being Zn and Pb the most significant trace elements. \n\n\n\n6.

Its \n\ncalculated median composition is Zn0.952Fe0.021S and the distribution of zinc and iron ion contents \n\nconfined to the following intervals: Zn0.576-0.999 and Fe0.002-0.210. Besides Fe, minor/trace amounts of Cu \n\nand Cd are meaningful, rising up to grades of 9.861 wt% and 0.673 wt%, respectively; concentration \n\ndistributions of these elements are, however, asymmetrical, presenting medians of 2610 ppm and 2020 \n\nppm. Also asymmetrical are the distributions of some meaningful trace amounts, such as Pb, As, Se, \n\nMn, Co, W and Te. These elements show maximum values up to 4960 ppm, 1770 ppm, 1020 ppm, \n\n41300 ppm, 1010 ppm, 2930 ppm and 1430, and their median contents are of 120 ppm, BDL, 50 ppm, \n\n110 ppm, 30 ppm, BDL and BDL respectively. The elements showing median values below detection \n\nlimit are characterised by third quartile values of 140 ppm, 520 ppm and 145 ppm respectively. Mo also \n\nhas significant trace amounts, but in opposition, it displays a quasi-normal distribution with median of \n\n560 ppm and amounts up to 1250 ppm (Fig 6.11). \n\n \nFig 6. 11 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by 181 analyses of sphalerite \n(values in wt% ). Minor/trace amounts of Cu and Cd are significant, traces of some other elements are noteworthy, namely Pb, \n\nMo and W, between others. \n\nFig 6.12 shows a Fe versus Cd bivariant plot of all samples, distinguishing the textural arrangements \n\nwhere the chemical analyses for sphalerite were gathered. It is observed that sphalerites in Mandoos 1 \n\nare relatively poor in Fe, and those samples displaying \u201cchalcopyrite disease\u201d features are characterised \n\nby higher amounts of Cd. Chemical analyses of wurtzite (distinguished from sphalerite under optica l \n\nmicroscopy, mostly due to its typical platy habit), sphalerite in masses showing triangular chalcopyrite  \n\nintergrowths (\u201cvent\u201d texture), and sphalerite with fibrous texture or occurring in veins/fractures share \n\nsimilar compositional characteristics in this plot, i.e. low contents of Fe and Cd (Fe &lt;1.5 wt%; Cd &lt;0.4 \n\n\n\n6. Mineral Chemistry \n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nwt%). Sphalerite forming massive/grain textural arrangements display two different trends, one towards \n\nCd enrichment (with low contents of Fe) and another towards Fe enrichments, showing low amounts of \n\nCd. The largest variation in Fe contents is recorded by sphalerite inclusions in pyrite, conceivably due \n\nto the \u201ccontamination\u201d of the host mineral.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 6. 13 - Bivariate diagram for textural discriminated sphalerite analysis. \n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0\n\nC\nd\n\n (\nw\n\nt%\n)\n\nFe (wt%)\n\nWurtzite\n\nMass w/ ccp intergrowth\n\nMassive/Grain\n\nInclusion\n\n\"Fibrous\"\n\nIn Vein/Fracture\n\nMassive w/ ccp disease\n\n40 30\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n\n8\n0\n\nFig 6. 12 - Ternary (S+As)\u2013Fe\u2013Cu\u2013 (Zn+Cd+Co) diagrams putting in evidence compositional dislocations towards Fe \n\nand Cu in sphalerites. \n\n \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nIn the S+As \u2013 Fe \u2013 Cu \u2013 Zn+Cd+Co diagram it is observed that wurtzite, massive sphalerite with \n\nchalcopyrite intergrowth, veins and fibrous chalcopyrite are all plotted close to the S+As \u2013 Zn+Cd+Co \n\naxis, overlaying the sphalerite ideal composition and showing no significant variations towards Fe \n\nenrichments. The same happens when Cu is added; thus, all samples are clustered in the Zn \u2013 Cd \u2013 Co \n\nvertex.  However, a distinct trend towards a minor Fe enrichment is observed in sphalerite samples \n\ndisplaying \u201cchalcopyrite disease\u201d features, forming massive aggregates and developing inclusions in \n\npyrite, being the first sphalerite type less Fe-enriched than the last two cases. These three different \n\ntextural arrangements also display a slight enrichment in Cu along with some sphalerite in veins. \n\n6.4 Galena \n\nGalena (PbS) is the less represented sulphide in all the studied samples. Indeed, tiny grains of galena \n\nare present in some samples, but their reduced dimension does not always allow the ac hievement of \n\nacceptable quantitative chemical analyses. The available data point to Pb contents varying from 0.976 \n\nand 1.005 atoms per formula unit, and a median composition of Pb0.976S. Although irregular, minor \n\namounts of Zn, Cu, Sb and Fe are present (Fig 6.14). These can go up to 20550 ppm, 5030 ppm, 2700 \n\nppm and 3410 ppm, and display median amounts of 10770 ppm, 3810 ppm, 1130 ppm and 1170 ppm , \n\nrespectively. The most significant trace amounts recorded are Sn, Se and Co; they are characterised by \n\nmedian values of 110 ppm, 100 ppm and 100 ppm and amounts that can reach 410 ppm, 690 ppm and \n\n380 ppm, respectively. \n\n \nFig 6. 14 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by 5 analyses of galena  \n(concentration values in wt% ). Note the relative importance of Zn, Cu, Sb and Fe as minor/trace elements. \n\n \n\n\n\n7. Whole Rock Chemistry \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n7. Whole-Rock Chemistry \n \n\nFrom the 42 samples collected during the sampling survey, 18 were chosen for minor and trace element \n\nanalysis via ICP-MS in the G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse laboratory (Observatoire Midi-\n\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es), Universit\u00e9 of Toulouse III. The same samples were also analysed via XRF for major elements \n\nat the University of Aveiro facilities. The analysed set comprises samples from different types of \n\nmassive sulphides (10), metalliferous sediments (6) and mineralised (sulphide-rich or Mn-rich) jaspers \n\n(2) (Appendix IX). Due to the limited number of samples, the correlation matrixes meanwhile calculated \n\nwere not as discriminative as expected, although a simple descriptive statistical study for the minor and \n\ntrace elements distributions was performed, and for major elements as well.  \n\n7.1 Major Elements \n\nThe major elements measured with XRF have concentration values consistent with the observations \n\ndone during re-logging and petrography. Indeed, samples of the Mandoos massive sulphides are Fe-rich \n\nand Cu-Zn-poor ores, and their correspondent grades are scattered in the intervals 3.96-24.73 wt% \n\n(median = 18.99 wt% Fe), 0.12-2.45 wt% (median = 0.51 wt% Cu) and 0.01-29.12 wt% (median = 0.048 \n\nwt% Zn) respectively, as can be seen in Fig 7.4. Silica contents are significant in these ores, rising up to \n\n13.87 wt% and having a median value of 11.02 wt% SiO2. These samples also contain Al and Ca, whose \n\noxides display median concentration values of 0.097 wt% Al2O3and 0.024 wt% CaO and maximum \n\ncontents of 5.46 wt% and 16.35 wt% respectively, following extremely asymmetric distributions .  \n\nSample MD-NP-1, a chalcopyrite- and sphalerite-rich ore sample, presents the highest Cu and Zn \n\ncontents coupled with significant grades of SiO2, Al2O3 and CaO mostly due to the presence of quartz \n\nand laumontite (CaAl2Si4O12 \u00b7 4H2O). As reported before, the ore samples are mostly breccias whose \n\ncement is enriched in SiO2, and this fact explains the high-silica content displayed by most of the \n\nsamples, excluding the specimens MD-P1-1-1 and MD-P3-4-1 which represent a massive pyrite \n\naccumulation and a breccia cemented by carbonates (thus displaying the highest content in CaO), \n\nrespectively. \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 7. 1 \u2013 Major elements distribution in sulphide ores.  \n\nUmbers (Fe- and Mn-rich sediments) and ochres (Fe-rich sediments) (Fleet &amp; Robertson, 1980) are the \n\ntwo metalliferous sediment types analysed in this section. As shown in Fig 7.2 (a), the Fe and Mn \n\ncontents are discriminative enough to separate both rock types (umbers and ochres). These contents have \n\ntheir values scattered between 26.52-54.73 wt% Fe and 0.2-1.78 wt% Mn respectively. Besides the \n\nexpected high-silica content, these samples also show CaO concentrations between 1.02 wt% and 12.61 \n\nwt% (median = 6.05 wt%). According to these results we may infer a set of 5 ochres and 1 umber \n\n(sample MD-178-110.5, with 1.78 wt% Mn). It is also possible to correlate the CaO contents with the \n\npresence of late carbonate veins, quite evident in sample MD-P2-2A, which is characterised by the \n\nhighest contents of this oxide. Noteworthy is the Cu extreme outlier (maximum = 3.73 wt%) displaye d \n\nby the sample MD-178-134.20, corresponding to a mineralised (massive sulphide) mineralised ochre. \n\nTwo different jasper samples were analysed, a mineralised sulphide-rich jasper (MD-150-114.10) and a \n\nmanganese ore with jasper clasts (MD-NP-3); Fig 7.2 (b) shows clearly the discrepant composition of \n\nthe two mineralised jasper samples, mostly in SiO2 and MnO. These element oxides have minimum \n\nvalues of 10.45 wt% and 0.01 wt% and maximum of 30.05 wt% and 47.19 wt% respectively, being the \n\nlatter value representative of the manganese ore (mainly pyrolusite \u2013 Appendix X). Also, the presence \n\nof minor amounts of Ba in the Mn-rich jasper sample is conceivably due to the presence of romanechite \n\n((Ba,H2O)2(Mn)5O10) in the manganese ore. \n\n \n\n\n\n7.

Also traces of Mo, Sn, Sb and Te are found in ore \n\nsamples whose distributions are characterised by median values of 8.08 ppm, 6.07 ppm, 6.35 ppm and \n\n12.46 ppm, respectively. \n\n \nFig 7. 3 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by massive sulphides (concentratio n  \n\nvalues in ppm). \n\nThe same set of minor elements is also found in metalliferous sediments, with the exception of Co and \n\nPb, just with trace amounts. Other relevant elements found in metalliferous sediments and measured as \n\ntraces are Cr, Ni and Sr (Fig 7.4); their correspondent grades are scattered within the 15.64-95.17 ppm, \n\n35.1-185.4 ppm and 36.21-117.13 ppm intervals, respectively.  \n\nDespite having a restrict number of samples, whole-rock analyses of mineralised jaspers show strong \n\nconsistency with the previous samples, displaying minor amounts of V, Co, Ni, As, Sr, Mo and Ba and \n\nsome traces of Ga, Te and Pb (Fig 7.5). The median values of 217 ppm, 67.61 ppm, 88.8 ppm, 287.62 \n\nppm, 224.86 ppm, 165.55 ppm and 372 ppm typify the concentration distributions of the aforementioned \n\nminor elements.  \n\nTo date there were no data available for minor and trace elements in samples representing the Sumail \n\nophiolite massive sulphides, being this exploratory work a further step in the characterisation of these \n\nores.  \n\n\n\n7.

In this approach, the relative enrichment and depletion of Eu and Ce were evaluated according \n\nto the Eu/Eu* and Ce/Ce* ratios defined as (McLennan, 1989): ?????* = ????(??? ? ???)0,5 and ?????? \n\n= 5????(4??? + ???). \n\nAll the samples representing sulphide ores (Fig 7.6A) are depleted in REE, as expected; their normalise d \n\npatterns are regular, revealing a feeble, almost imperceptible, enrichment in HREE, along with a positive  \n\nanomaly in Eu (Eu*= 1.15 to 1.84) and a slight negative anomaly in Ce (Ce*= 0.41 to 0.91). The sample \n\nMD-P3-4-1 represents a massive sulphide breccia cemented by carbonates and is the most REE enriched \n\n(?1 to 2\u00d7 C1) specimen of the entire set. This is possibly related to the incorporation of REE in \n\ncarbonates. As seen in Fig 7.6, the REE normalised pattern characterising the sulphide ores can be \n\nexplained by a mixture of vent fluids and seawater; with this simple mixture it is possible to obtain a \n\nslight enrichment in HREE and a Ce negative anomaly (inherited characteristic from the seawater) \n\ntogether with a Eu positive anomaly (the most distinctive feature of vent fluids). \n\nMetalliferous sediments (Fig 7.6B) are the most REE-enriched samples, displaying a wide range of \n\nvalues. The REE normalised patterns are characterised by LREE relative enrichments along with slight \n\nHREE depletions. An evident negative anomaly in Ce (Ce*= 0.15 to 0.18) is shown in all samples, \n\ntogether with a feeble negative anomaly in Eu (Eu*= 0.73 to 0.82). When compared with the seawater \n\npattern (Fig 7.6D) it is clear that their pattern indicates a REE scavenging of the ocean by adsorption in \n\nphyllosilicates forming the sediments.  \n\nBoth jasper samples share similarities in the pattern shape, revealing relative enrichments in LREE and \n\nfaint enrichments in HREE. Sample MD-NP-3 displays a weak positive anomaly in Ce (Ce*=1.19) and \n\nan evident negative anomaly in Eu (Eu*= 0.07), while sample MD-150-114.10 shows a negative  \n\nanomaly in Ce (Ce*= 0.34) and a positive one in Eu (Eu*= 1.56). The mineralised sulphide-rich jasper \n\ndisplays a pattern alike of that showed by the sulphide ore sample MD-P3-4-1; like in sulphide ore \n\nsamples, these REE normalised patterns suggest the development of mixtures of seawater and vent fluids  \n\nbut the former component (seawater) is now more important. The Mn-rich mineralised jasper shows a \n\ndistinct REE normalised pattern, conceivably due to the geochemical behaviour of Ce (Ce3+ is soluble  \n\nunder reducing conditions, precipitating as Ce4+ in oxidizing conditions); The sample is mainly \n\ncomposed of pyrolusite (Mn4+O2), identified via XRD (Appendix X), so most of the Ce might be \n\nincorporated in the Mn4+ position. \n\n\n\n7.

Depletion in Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, and Nb, as well as in REE and Th, are \n\nwell marked. However, Mo, Cd, In, Sb, Te and Pb display an evident enrichment in all the sulphide ore \n\nsamples. The Zn-rich sample (MD-NP-1) displays, as expected, a Cd enrichment above 60000x PM. \n\nThe sulphide ore samples are also characterised by amounts of Mo between 50 and 2300x PM, Sb can \n\nvary from ?300 to ?5000x PM and Te between 40 and 3000x PM; the Pb positive anomaly denotes \n\nenrichment above 180x PM, never exceeding 1190x PM. \n\nMetalliferous sediments are enriched in all the measured elements with exception of Sc, Ti, Cr, Co and \n\nNi. Well-defined positive anomalies in P, V, Cu, As, Mo, Sb, W, Pb and U are observed in all samples; \n\nP displays enrichments from ?40 to ?70x PM, while As (the most enriched element) is characterised by \n\nvalues ranging from ?980x PM to ?5600x PM. W and Pb also display high levels of enrichment in these \n\nsediments; W varies from ?45x to ?180X PM, while Pb enrichments can reach amounts ?1500x above \n\nthe primitive mantle. The measured Mo, In, Sb and Te concentration are also significant in some \n\nsamples, reaching maximums of 313x, 266x, 821x and 689x PM, respectively. \n\nJasper samples (MD150-114.10), represented by a mineralised sulphide-rich jasper and a manganese \n\nore with jasper clasts (MD-NP-3), are relatively enriched in As, Mo, Cd, Sb, W and U when compared \n\nto the primitive mantle. The As values range between 1230x and 7230x PM; Cd contents may reach up \n\nto 5270x PM; and Sb concentrations remain below ?1000x PM. In these samples, the U contents vary \n\nbetween 54x and 243x PM. Also noteworthy, are the enrichments in Ba (?108x PM) and W (?141x PM) \n\nin the MD-NP-3 sample, as well as in Cu (?535x PM) and Pb (?142x PM) in sample MD150-114.10. \n\nOverall enrichments in Cd, In, Te, W, and Sn (observed in the minor and trace elements chapter) \n\nrepresents conceivable signals of magmatic inputs to the hydrothermal-mineralis ing fluids involved in \n\nsulphide deposition. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7.

Whole Rock Chemistry \n\n \n\n61 \n \n\n7.5 Immobile Elements \n\nSince the relative mobility of elements in different geochemical settings is not a determined feature, \n\nbeing influenced by a wide number of features depending on element and/or environmenta l \n\ncharacteristics, it is crucial to test for each situation which elements present an immobile behaviour.  \n\nUsually, various elements (such as Al, Zr, Ti, Nb, Y, Sc) tend to behave as immobile in a large \n\nassortment of geological processes and a common and simple approach to validate such relative  \n\nimmobility consists in plotting these elements against each other, resulting in a good positive linear co-\n\nvariation that contains the origin.  \n\n  \n\nThe figure above (7.9) shows two examples of the plots obtained with the studied samples, indicating \n\nthat Y, Zr and Nb can be considered geochemically immobile during the development of sulphide ores, \n\nmineralised jaspers and metalliferous sediments; according to the available data, La and Yb can also be \n\n0.0\n\n10.0\n\n20.0\n\n30.0\n\n40.0\n\n50.0\n\n60.0\n\n70.0\n\n0.0 20.0 40.0\n\nY\n (\n\np\np\n\nm\n)\n\nZr (ppm)\n\nSulphide ores Umber &amp; Ochres Jaspers\n\n0.0\n\n10.0\n\n20.0\n\n30.0\n\n40.0\n\n50.0\n\n60.0\n\n70.0\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0\n\nY\n (\n\np\np\n\nm\n)\n\nNb (ppm)\n\nMassive Sulfides Umber &amp; Ochres Jaspers\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n10.0\n\n0.0 0.1 1.0 10.0\n\nY/\nZ\n\nr\n\nLa/Zr\n\nSulphide ores Umber &amp; Ochres Jaspers\n\nFig 7. 9 \u2013 Y vs Zr and Y vs Nb plots showing the immobility of these elements. \n\n \n\nFig 7. 10 \u2013 Y/Zr vs La/Zr plot showing two different sources for the studied samples. \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n \n\nclassified as immobile. Using now the ratios between immobile elements, one may put in evidence the \n\ndistinct sources (protoliths) related to the sulphide ores and hydrothermal sediments (Fig 7.10). \n\nThe plot La/Zr versus Y/Zr shown in Fig 7.10 is an example of that discrimination: a wide cluster that \n\ncomprises the massive sulphide samples and a more constricted cluster involving all the metalliferous  \n\nsediments (umber &amp; ochres). Noteworthy is the presence of the jasper samples in both clusters, which \n\nis entirely consistent with the mineralogical characteristics of the analysed samples: sample MD-NP-3 \n\n(manganese ore) shares more affinities with metalliferous sediments; sample MD150-114.10, a \n\nsulphide-rich mineralised jasper is compositionally influenced by the mechanims related to the sulphide  \n\nore development. The deviation displayed by sample MD-P3-4-1 is ascribed to the relative abundance \n\nof late-formed carbonates in the sulphide breccia. \n\nNormalising all the values to an immobile element will reduce the dilution factor, allowing to directly \n\ncompare samples. For this exercise, Y was the immobile element chosen. Fig 7.11 compares all samples \n\nfrom the three different rock types collected during sampling: sulphide ores, umber and ochres and \n\njaspers. A general inspection shows that all the samples display similar patterns; however: sulphide ores \n\nare the most chemically enriched; metalliferous sediments are the less chemically enriched; and jaspers \n\noccupy an intermediate position between those two \u201cend-members\u201d. \n\nA closer look into individual groups allow to better evaluate the enrichment factors; sulphide ores are \n\nmainly enriched in SiO2, Fe2O3, S, As, Sr, Mo, Ta and Tl. Sample MD-P3-4-1 displays a slightly \n\ndifferent pattern, also with the particularity of being the less-enriched sample amongst all sulphide ores, \n\nas expected (mineralised breccia cemented by carbonates). Samples MD-NP-1 and MD-178-128.80 \n\nshow evident enrichment in Zn and Cd not registered in other samples, which is compatible with the \n\nobserved significant amounts of sphalerite. Noteworthy is also the enrichment in Te in many samples. \n\nMetalliferous sediments (Fig 7.11C) show enrichment in SiO2, Fe2O3, CaO, As, Sr, Ba and U. Major \n\nvariations amongst these samples are in Cu, Cd, Te and Ta, whose enrichment factors can vary from \n\ntens to 1000x between them. \n\nJaspers present two different patterns but with common enrichments in SiO2, Fe2O3, S, As, Mo and U.  \n\nThe MnO, Ba and Sr enrichments in sample MD-NP-3 are significantly higher (1000x and 100x, \n\nrespectively) than those recorded by the sulphide-rich mineralised jasper. \n\n\n\n7.

Discussion \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n8. Discussion \n \n\nMafic type deposits are described as Cu-rich and Pb-poor when compared to other VMS deposits (Barrie \n\n&amp; Hannington, 1999). The geometric mean of metals concentration in sulphide ores from different VMS \n\ndeposits in distinct host-rock settings are reported in Hannington (2014). Fig 8.1 exhibits the distribution \n\nof these geometric mean concentrations in a Cu-Pb-Zn diagram, showing that the majority of VMS \n\ndeposits are plotted in the Zn-Pb-Cu field, while the mafic-type deposits are distributed within the Cu-\n\nZn-rich field. The studied VMS samples from Mandoos 1 deposit were also included in this diagram, \n\nrepresented by the median values of the available concentration metal distributions (marked as \n\nMandoos). Mandoos 1 is plotted in the Cu-type field, being relatively enriched in Cu when compared to \n\nother mafic-type deposits. The 8 Mt orebody displays an average grade of 1.72 wt% Cu, which showed \n\nto be slightly below the assessed value, although this might be explained by the incomplete database \n\nprovided by the company, which only made available the survey for 33 drill holes. Petrography and \n\nmineral chemistry did not present evidence for zone refining, and the modelling of Cu and Zn grades \n\nalso did not also document a metal zoning in the deposit. Nonetheless, it can be shown that (at least) \n\npart of the observed Cu enrichment comes from secondary Cu-rich phases developed in the course of a \n\nmore oxidising (late) evolving event. As previously stated, the presence of numerous primary textures \n\nin sulphide ores and clasts suggest that refining processes were not important during the development \n\nof Mandoos 1 ores, placing them in a black-smoker type environment (some of the studied samples \n\nconceivably represent products of the crumbling of hydrothermal chimneys). The large amount of \n\nprimary textures (framboidal and colloform) preserved in the studied samples allows also to reconsider \n\nthe topic regarding the biogenic origin of pyrite in such systems. Framboids are known to be spherical \n\nto sub-spherical aggregates, composed by microcrystals of equigranular pyrite with a dense (cubic-\n\n)packing arrangement; nevertheless, irregular aggregates (loose packing) are also common (Wilken &amp; \n\nBarnes, 1997). Many authors suggested that these forms corresponded to pyritized bacterial colonies ; \n\nhowever the nucleation of pyrite framboidal microcrystals can also be a result of the ferromagnetic \n\nproperties of greigite (Fe3S4), the precursor in this type of structure.

According to Wilken &amp; Barnes (1997) the \n\npreservation of framboidal textures may be related to secondary pyrite outward growth, while Ostwald \n\n&amp; England (1979) suggested that the crystallization of euhedral pyrite forms can result from framboids  \n\nrecrystallisation; this recrystallisation is characterised by an intermediate stage, of pyrite spherulites , \n\nending in the final euhedral shape; Fig 8.2 shows the same structures present in this deposit. In addition, \n\ncolloform textures provide us a sequential information of physical and chemical conditions during \n\nprecipitation and, despite the clear relationship between bacteria and sulphur reduction, the relationship \n\nof bacterial agents in the direct precipitation of crystals is more unlikely. These textures (colloform \n\ntextures), just like framboidal, are thought to result of primary precipitation from the hydrotherma l \n\nfluids, and not related to any bacterial related process. This is, possibly, the process that leads to the \n\nformation of most, if not all, colloform structures (Barrie et al. 2009). \n\nIt is also important to discuss the relationship between pyrite and marcasite, as well as between sphalerite  \n\nand wurtzite, considering their coexistence in some of the studied samples. This aims to constrain the \n\nphysical-chemical conditions that inhibit and/or favour one phase crystallization in relation to the other. \n\nRamdohr (1969) describes marcasite, unlike pyrite, as unstable under most pressure and temperature  \n\nconditions reproduced in laboratory experiments, only switched whenever particular circumstances are \n\nimposed (such as, quite acid solutions at moderate temperatures). It is also suggested by the same author \n\nthat wurtzite is metastable and its occurrence is only possible under low pressure and temperature \n\nconditions in equilibrium with acid solutions. The commonly acceptable paramorphism implies the \n\n\u201cchanging\u201d of wurtzite (hexagonal structure) to sphalerite (cubic structure); consequently, according to \n\nthis reasoning, the two mineral phases can only coexist in contexts where the slow reaction time-periods \n\nFig 8. 2 \u2013 A \u2013 Framboidal pyrite; B \u2013 recrystallized pyrite with preserved spherulites; C \u2013 pyrite polyhedron crystallised around \n\na framboid; D \u2013 clast of polyhedron pyrite with preserved framboidal core being replaced by chalcopyrite. \n\n\n\n8. Discussion \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nof the phase transformation are favoured. In sea mounds, dramatic variations in temperature and pH can \n\nbe recorded within short distances (millimetres to centimetres) due to the interaction of hydrotherma l \n\nvent fluids with cold sea water. Both minerals crystallise from acidic solutions; the mixture of such \n\nsolution with sea water would result in a pH increase. This allows to explain the common presence of \n\nmarcasite encased in pyrite crystals, where the abrupt variations in the chemical conditions promote the \n\ncrystallisation of the most stable phase. The same process can be used to explain the presence of \n\nparamorphic sphalerite after wurtzite.  \n\nThe Mandoos 1 stockwork is characterised by silicified basalts, where the silica is leached out from the \n\nbasalt due to high temperatures, increasing porosity and resulting in sulphide dissemination. The \n\ncontinuous leaching can also be responsible for small/local collapses and creation of breccia zones. With \n\nthe system cooling, the stockwork silicification becomes stronger due to the remaining silica advected \n\nfrom the deeper domains of the hydrothermal system. Strong silicification zones are seen associated \n\nwith larger euhedral pyrite clusters formed in vuggs and also large anhedral pyrite clas ts, showing \n\nbreccia texture, possibly corresponding to local collapse zones.  \n\nAs previously stated, the Mandoos sulphide ores are quite monotonous in composition and mainly \n\nformed by iron sulphides, although the presence of accessory Cu- and Zn-rich phases is common. A \n\ngeneral paragenetic sequence resulted from petrography is illustrated in Fig 8.3. However, as seen \n\nbefore, in these kind of geological environment, significant chemical variations can took place in short-\n\nrange space and such variations, combined with intense crumbling and mass-waste movements, may \n\nlead to different textural interpretations depending on the sampled area of the massive sulphide orebody.  \n\n \n\nFig 8. 3 \u2013 Schematic representation of the paragenetic sequence proposed for Mandoos 1 deposit. \n\nThe oxidation event is possibly synchronous of jaspers formation and the periodic leaching/silicifica tion \n\nevents would be responsible for the same hydrothermal imprint in jaspers and silicified (footwall) \n\nbasalts. The sulphide dissemination in jaspers is possible due to an increasing of porosity during \n\nleaching, leading also to the formation of veins and some collapse breccias, later silicified when the \n\nsystem was subjected to cooling. The presence of the leached rims in the pyrite crystals indicate the \n\ncirculation of late Fe-poor fluids, evidenced by the leaching of iron from the jaspers.  \n\nWhen massive sulphides are not covered, sea floor weathering can produce umbers and ochres, where \n\nmassive sulphide breccias are oxidised and impregnated with silica in a colder and more oxidis ing \n\nenvironment. Nevertheless, these can also be formed by direct precipitation of metals within the water \n\ncolumn, partly derived from the exhalative discharge, and further deposited in oxidising conditions  \n\nalong with the siliciclastic sediments (largely dominated by phyllosilicates). \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\nWhole rock chemistry, more precisely the REE normalised pattern analysis, suggests that sulphide ores \n\ndeposition is strongly influenced by a mixture of vent fluids and seawater, while the composition of \n\number and ochres is mainly determined by processes of seawater scavenging followed by phyllosilic a te  \n\nadsorption mechanisms (Fig 8.4). A mixture of seawater and vent fluids should also be involved in the \n\nformation of mineralised jaspers, but in this case the seawater weight in the mixture proportion is  \n\nconsiderably higher. With the exception of umber and ochres, whose REE contents appear to derive  \n\nexclusively from seawater, the REE abundances in sulphide ores and jaspers are conceivably related to \n\nthe leaching and scavenging of footwall basalts synchronous of their hydrothermal alteration. It is known \n\nthat footwall volcanic rocks are leached by infiltrated seawater, circulating along fractures, producing a \n\nvariably modified seawater which is further released in hydrothermal chimneys, as vent fluid. Assuming \n\nthat REE concentrations are in equilibrium with the vent fluid (i.e. that no significant fractionation took \n\nplace after the massive sulphide ore and jaspers deposition) a simple simulation can be performed in \n\norder to predict the ratio of seawater (SW) and basalt involved in such process. Regarding to footwall \n\nless altered basalts (B), a SW:B mixing proportion scattered between 0.85:0.15 and 0.99:0.01 is needed \n\nto simulate the REE enrichment displayed by the studied samples. If the more altered footwall basalts \n\n(B\u2019) are used, the requested SW:B\u2019 proportion mixtures range between 0.50:0.50 and 0.95:0.05 because \n\nB\u2019 are significantly more depleted in REE than B. It is also noteworthy that SW:B and SW:B\u2019 \n\ninteractions  simulate roughly the measured vent fluids in modern analogues magnitudes (TAG an EPR) \n\nwith mixing proportions between 0.999:0.001 and 0.9999:0.0001. Nevertheless, the pattern displaye d \n\nby these vent fluids, characterised by an evident Eu positive anomaly and positive LREE and HREE \n\nfractionation, are not completely reproduced in this numerical simulation. This is related to the simplis tic  \n\nmodelling and rough approach to the problem, which does not consider other geochemical factors that \n\nmay control the vent fluid composition; as previously shown, there is evidence for a magmatic  \n\ncontribution to the hydrothermal fluid responsible for the mineralisation, and this may be one cause for \n\nthe recorded differences. \n\n \n\nFig 8. 4 \u2013 Vent fluid REE binary simulation using seawater and basalt compositions. \n\n \n\n1.E-06\n\n1.E-05\n\n1.E-04\n\n1.E-03\n\n1.E-02\n\n1.E-01\n\n1.E+00\n\n1.E+01\n\n1.E+02\n\nLa Ce Pr Nd Sm Eu Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Yb Lu\n\nS\na\n\nm\np\n\nle\n/C\n\n1\n\nVent Fl ui d EPR Seawa ter Vent Fl ui d TA G FW  less al ter ed ba sa lt (B)\n\nFw a lter ed ba sa lt (B') SW :B (0.99:0.01) Sw:B ' (0. 9999:0.0001)\n\n\n\n9. Conclusions \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n9. Conclusions  \n \n\nThe metal contents of drill-core and open-pit samples place the Mandoos deposit in the Cu-rich VMS \n\nfield, near the typical Mafic-type VMS deposits. Additionally, the 3D modelling performed with \n\nMICROMINE estimates on ca. 8 Mt of ore with 1.72 wt% in Cu. The lack of evident chemical zonation \n\nof the orebody, as indicated by the 3D modelling results, suggests also that metal zoning refinement \n\nprocesses were not significant all through the evolving stages recorded by the ore-forming system at \n\nMandoos. \n\nThe massive ores are mainly composed of sulphide-rich breccias cemented by silica and/or zeolite s , \n\nwith minor phyllosilicates. These breccias are polymictic, comprising clasts widely varied in size , \n\ntextural arrangements and mineral composition. They are possibly part of the talus found in many \n\nhydrothermal field vents in present-day analogues, where the (cyclic) crumbling of hydrotherma l \n\nchimneys produce debris later cemented by siliceous fluids. This mineralisation type is characterised by \n\na monotonous and simple mineral assemblage mainly composed of pyrite and marcasite with minor \n\namounts of chalcopyrite, sphalerite and other Cu-rich phases.  \n\nThe ubiquitous presence of primary textures, ranging from framboidal and colloform pyrite and \n\nmarcasite, to the preservation of pyritised tubeworm burrows also place the studied samples in a black-\n\nsmoker type vent. In these environments, the presence of framboidal pyrite crystal is interpreted as \n\nconsequence of the magnetic properties of greigite, the precursor of pyrite. Additionally, the presence \n\nof marcasite and sphalerite (after pyrite and wurtzite, respectively) can be explained as a result of abrupt \n\npH (and T?) modifications experienced by the hydrothermal fluids, especially when mixture with sea-\n\nwater occurs in (sub)superficial conditions.  \n\nThe formation of jaspers is considered to be a result of the temperature collapse of the hydrotherma l \n\nsystem, correlative of the late oxidisation evolving stage, where Cu-rich mineral phases are formed \n\n(from chalcopyrite). Consequently, during the following bleaching of these silica and Fe-rich exhalative  \n\nrocks, sulphide mineralization also occurs, from the scavenging of iron from the jaspers. \n\nWhen the massive sulphides are exposed to the oxidising cold sea-water, oxidation phenomena occur, \n\nproducing metalliferous sediments. These are easily distinguishable by their REE pattern and metal \n\ncontents, which indicate that they derive, mostly, from sea-water fluids. Furthermore, the REE patterns \n\nfor the massive sulphide breccias and mineralised jaspers are compatible with the mixture of vent fluid \n\nand sea-water. Vent fluid simulations were performed and established mixtures of SW:B and SW:B\u2019 \n\nscattered between 0.85:0.15 and 0.99:0.01, and 0.50:0.50 and 0.95:0.05, respectively, in order to reach \n\nores and jaspers REE enrichment magnitudes. Modern day analogues vent fluid REE enrichments are \n\npredicted with mixtures of seawater and basalt ranging between 0.999:0.001 and 0.9999:0.0001, \n\nalthough, the typical pattern is not reproduced due to a magmatic contribution to the hydrothermal fluid \n\nwhich geochemical properties are not contemplated in the simulation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nOre mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman \n\n \n\n71 \n \n\nReferences \n \n\nALABAST ER, T., PEARCE, J.A. &amp; MALP AS, J., 1982, The Volcanic Stratigraphy and Petrogenesis of the Oma n  \n\nOphiolite Complex.
