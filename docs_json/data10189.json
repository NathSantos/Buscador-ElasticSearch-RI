In digital nerves injuries, the \nbest outcomes after repair were found in children, showing \nthe need of further nervous regeneration studies in adult \npopulations(2).\nUsing a tube for repairing an injured nerve is not new (3). \nTubes seem to be important for regeneration because they \ncomprise neurotrophic substances that help on guiding \naxons towards their distal target (4). The great driver towards \nresearches using tubes with veins emerged after experi-\nments in rats showing that the light of veins allows for nerve \nregeneration(5).\nIn large nervous substance losses, when a vein is used for \nfilling the gap, adherences may occur. However, when a vein \nis filled with muscles, these adherences are prevented, and \nthere is no fiber dispersion from proximal and distal stumps, \nalso enabling the avoidance of fibrosis and blood intake \nimprovement(6). \nBased on these data, the present study intended to compare \nthe effectiveness of a vein-covered denaturized muscle graft, \n\nin Wistar rats\u2019 tibial nerves, when compared to traditional \nautogenous graft, using counts of neurons marked with \nFluoro-Gold\u00ae.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\nThe experimental protocols used in this study have been \napproved by the Committee on Medical Ethics in Research, \nHospital S\u00e3o Paulo / Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, accor-\nding to the International Ethical Guidelines(7).  \nWistar race rats were used, which weighted 155 g in average, \nand kept under controlled conditions with light/dark cycle \n(12/12 h), at a temperature of  21\u00b1 2\u00baC, with water and food \nad libitum, throughout the experiment period.  \nIn total, 29 rats were operated, but only 15 could be included \nin the study group, because the others presented compli-\ncations during the performance of the various experimental \nprocedures, making data quantification difficult.  \nThe animals were anesthetized with a solution constituted of \nchloral hydrate, magnesium sulfate, thionembutal, propylene \nglycol, ethylene alcohol and 4ml/Kg distilled water.\nSurgery constituted of removing external jugular vein (Figure 1) \n\nSUMMARY\nThe purpose of this work was to study nervous regeneration \nthrough neurons counts by comparing two surgical techni-\nques for addressing nervous gaps on 15 rats\u2019 lower limbs. \nInitially, a 12-mm long vein tube from the left outer jugular was \nobtained, and then both lower limbs are operated, exposing \nthe tibial nerve at each side and performing a resection of \nan 8-mm nerve segment, at the same time simulating a gap \nand an autogenous nerve graft. Left gap repair consisted of \na usual conventional graft for nervous injury repair by means \nof microsurgical suture. The gap repair on right lower limbs \nwas made through quadriceps muscle, treated with liquid \nnitrogen, covered with an 8-mm tube of jugular vein.

The venous graft was kept soaked into 0.9% saline \nsolution until its use.   \nThe sciatic nerve and its branches (sural, peroneal, and \ntibial) were exposed. The right tibial nerve was dissected \nand manipulated as minimally as possible (Figure 3). An \n8-mm segment was sectioned, leaving a proximal stump \nof approximately 3 mm (Figure 4). The nerve segment was \nmaintained in 0.9% saline solution.  \nThe injury provoked to the left tibial nerve was adjusted by \ninterposing the nerve graft removed from the contralateral \nlimb and sutured with two epineural nylon 10-0 monofila-\nment stitches.\nAt the right side, 1 cm of muscle was removed, which was \nkept in liquid nitrogen for performing denaturing(8). The de-\nnatured muscle was sutured to proximal stump and then \ncovered with a vein tube (Figure 5). Once the vein was ac-\ncommodated on the whole muscle segment, suturing was \nprovided with the proximal and distal epineurium so that the \nvein could not be displaced from muscular graft. Muscle and \nskin planes were sutured with 4-0 nylon monofilament.  \nAfter 120 postoperative days, the animals were submitted \nto a new surgery for exposing right and left tibial nerves \n(Figure 6) for performing the neuronal marking with 3% \nFluoro-Gold\u00ae (Fluorochrome Inc.) for subsequent neuron \ncount at the anterior spinal cord horn.\n\nThe nerve was exposed to dye for 90 minutes. After that time, \nmuscle and skin planes were sutured. \nThe animals, 48 hours after dye exposure, were anesthetized \nagain and then submitted to a transcardiac perfusion by \nmeans of a port on thoracic box and heart exposure. The \nleft ventricle was punctured with a needle and the infused \nsolutions were drained by sectioning the right atrium.\nDuring perfusion, the buffered solutions at physiological pH \nphosphate 0.2M and 10% sucrose 10% were used. \nFinished the perfusion, the marrow was removed with the \naid of a microscope. Laminectomy was initiated at S2 level. \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Identification of the external jugular vein.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Measurement of the 12-mm segment to be \nremoved from external jugular vein.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 \u2013 Exposure of a sciatic nerve and its branches.\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 8- mm section of the right tibial nerve.\n\nFigure 5 \u2013  Jugular vein accommodation on muscle graft.\n\n\n\n99ACTA ORTOP BRAS 15 (2: 97-100, 2007)\n\nDorsal roots of L3, L4, L5, L6 and S1 were identified, and \nthe L3 and S1 roots\u2019 path was followed up to its entry into \nthe marrow, which was cross-sectionally sectioned in order \nto preserve L4, L5 and L6 segment. \n\nThe marrow segment was submitted to a cryoprotection \nprocess with 20% sucrose and subsequent cutting with a \nfreezing microtome, into 40\u00b5m sections.\nThe slides were assembled and analyzed under fluorescent \nmicroscope. The anterior horn of the spinal cord was asses-\nsed and motor neurons were identified (Figure 7). Only the \ncells typically marked with Fluoro-Gold were assessed in \norder to avoid any misinterpretation. From the total of cells, \nthe Abercrombie\u2019s(9) adjusting criteria were used for serial \ncuts to microtome.  \nAs statistical evaluation methods, the following tests were \nused: the paired \u201ct\u201d test, the signaled Wilcoxon\u2019s test and \nthe Mann-Whitney\u2019s test.\n\nRESULTS\nAfter neuron counting, results in absolute values were adjus-\nted by using the Abercrombie\u2019s criteria(9) (Table 1).\nMotor neurons counting at the anterior spinal cord horn \nFor statistical analysis, the paired \u201ct\u201d test was used, where \nit is performed by subtracting both sides of each rat and \nremoving its individual effect.

That age was selected in order to avoid losing them \nby age-related diseases(10).\nFifteen out of the 29 operated rats were used at the end of \nthe study, because during the experiment, some technical \nproblems such as animals\u2019 deaths by cardiac-respiratory \nfailure during anesthesia, postoperative complications, \npoor fixation or cryoprotection of the tissue, among others, \nmade us unable to use the remaining animals. However, as \na large amount of cells stained in each slide were analyzed, \nthis number of animals was enough to find similar data to \nliterature (11,12).\nThe selection of the external jugular vein is because of the \nadvantages it presents when compared to the femoral vein. \nThose advantages include: a) a wider diameter - which allows \na better quality suture and covers stumps\u2019 ends, avoiding \nthe development of neuromas at the suture, b) it does not \nhave valves - thus avoiding hurdles for axonal growth(13), \nc) vessel length is enough for tubing, and d) it avoids any \nsignificant tissue damage to rats\u2019 legs - by a double incision \nwhen addressing the nerve laterally and the venous graft \nmedially.  \nThe tibial nerve was used for two reasons: it reduces cell \ndeath and mimics peripheral injuries usually found in clinical \npractice. If the sciatic nerve was employed in this study, we \nwould be at risk of finding some problems to the rats, typical \nof lower limbs injuries, such as: insensitive parts autophagy \n(10), skin ulcers(11) and difficult upright position stabilization \nallowing the animal to eat. The use of both limbs of the same \nanimal was due to individual organic variations of each rat, \nwhich could compromise results reliability when comparing \nthe proposed surgical procedures (10,12).\nThe selection of an 8-mm size for substance loss was made \nby complying with the limits described in literature, which \nreports that this measure should not exceed 10 mm (14).\n\n\n\n100 ACTA ORTOP BRAS 15(2: 97-100, 2007)\n\nInside the vein graft, a muscle denaturized with liquid nitrogen \nwas used(15), because it presents a lower size reduction rate, \nwhich is 42%, while microwave denaturizing is approximately \n89%(16). Denaturing rate in the muscles employed in this \nstudy was approximately 20%. This data was obtained by \nmeasuring values previously and subsequently to denatu-\nrizing process.   \nThe established interval time of 4 months between the first and \nthe second surgery is due to the fact that this time is enough \nfor nerve regeneration(4), making the study to be more reliable, \nbecause by doing so, the nerve should not go through age-\nrelated biological changes, thus keeping its original structure. \nSome authors, however, consider 5 months as an optimal time \ninterval between procedures (17).  \nAfter tibial nerve section, during the first surgery, the rats showed \nlimping on both rear legs, while in the second procedure, they \nshowed clinically well and without any atrophies. The dissection \nof the surgical plane was easier on the leg grafted with vein-\ncovered muscle, which is consistent to literature findings(18). It \nis worthy to highlight that this is an interesting data, enabling \nclinical application in cases where cicatricial response is im-\nportant, such as for the treatment of compressive syndromes \nrecurrences (19).\nFor nervous regeneration analysis, we used the Fluoro-Gold\u00ae \nas a retrograde neuronal marker at 3% strength, but this may \nrange from 2 to 4%. This fluorescent marker enables a direct \nvisualization under a microscope, not requiring chromogens \nuse, which facilitates experiment reproduction(12).  This direct \nvisualization is based on the presence of a marker, retrogra-\ndely transported to cell body(20) thus allowing the nerve to be \nrepresented on marrow.\nThe negative aspect of using Fluoro-Gold\u00ae as a neuronal marker \nlies on the fact that by being illuminated during the analysis, \nfluorescence is progressively reduced, making a reassessment \nof the same slide impossible.  \nDuring transcardiac perfusion, a sucrose solution was used for \nprotecting the tissue against freezing aggressions, thus allowing \na better visualization and analysis of the tissue to be assessed. \nThis important step was reported by other authors(10,12).\nIn order to avoid counting the same cell more than once \n\nat different sections, the adjustment factor established by \nAbercrombie(9) was employed for 40 \u00b5m sections. The results \nwere presented as absolute and adjusted values (Table 1), \nbut the statistical analysis was made on the basis of adjusted \nvalues.  \nThree statistical tests were used for determining whether \na significant difference existed or not between employed \ntechniques.  \nThere was no statistically significant difference between the \nmethods; therefore, the denatured muscle graft covered with \nvein shows a similar number of marked cells when compared \nto the simple-graft method.   \nWe have not been able to compare the results of this study \nto literature data, because no correlation was found between \nmuscle-and-vein graft in reviewed studies.\nOliveira(14), using a denatured muscle graft compared to a \nconventional nervous graft, found no statistical difference \nbetween both methods as well.  \nTwo of the animals employed presented a lower number \ncell count, but the differences between both sides remained \nreasonably proportional, which did not change the statistical \nanalysis.   \nA combination of a muscle and vain graft was used, based \non the principle that an injured nerve produces a high amount \nof axon-regenerating substances (11) and the vein, for being \na tube system with selective permeability, would avoid these \nsubstances to be spread, facilitating nervous regeneration. \nThe denatured muscle would maintain basal membrane, \nacting as a support system for regenerating neurons.  \n\nCONCLUSION\nWe did not detect statistical differences between the groups \ntreated with conventional nervous graft and muscle graft de-\nnatured with liquid nitrogen covered with autogenous vein.  \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nWe acknowledge Drs.
