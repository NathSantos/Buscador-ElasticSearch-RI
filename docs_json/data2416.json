Sarcopenia.\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nThe reduction in strength and Muscle Mass (MM) that accompanies ageing is defined as sarcopenia1, which in turn is very prevalent in older adults of all ages, especially the very old ones2.\nSarcopenia is one of the most widely used variables for indicating reduced mobility and functional capacity and increased frailty in older adults, increasing the risk of falls and fractures, dependence on others to carry out activities of daily living, hospitalizations, and early death3,4.\nThe development of sarcopenia seems to stem from a numerical reduction in motor neurons, muscle fiber atrophy, especially of the type IIA, a decrease in anabolic hormones, an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, and changes in protein and calorie intakes that occur with ageing1-5-6.\nStudies have cited some factors that may be associated with sarcopenia, namely gender2,7, Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD), especially osteoarticular diseases8,9, and nutritional status10. The identification of such factors is important to prevent frailty and functional incapacity in older adults of all ages, especially the very old ones. However, there is a lack of studies that investigate such aspects in adults aged 80 years and older. Hence, the objective of this study was to analyze whether sarcopenia is associated with sociodemographic factors and NCD in very old adults.\nM E T H O D S\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2009 and May 2010 in the city\nof Presidente Prudente (approximately 210,000 inhabitants), located in the western region of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil11.\nThe participants were chosen by convenience sampling. A total of 135 female and male adults aged 80 years and older from the abovementioned city were invited to participate in the study. The municipal Department of Health provided the name, address, and telephone number of users of the municipal health care system. The study was advertised in the local media, and the individuals were invited to join by telephone. The inclusion criteria were: age 80 years and older and having lived in Presidente Prudente (SP) for at least two years. The exclusion criteria were: inability to walk, being bedridden, living in rural areas, using pacemakers, and incomplete personal data in the database. The final sample consisted of 120 individuals.\nThe participants were informed about the study objectives and data collection methodology, and that they were free to drop out of the study at any time. Only those who signed an informed consent form were allowed to join the study. All protocols were reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Estadual Paulista (Process n\u00b0 26/2009).\nSociodemographic factors and chronic noncommunicable diseases\nAge stratum (80-84 years and >85 years), gender, marital status, education level, ethnicity, and study NCD (high blood pressure, diabetes, and osteopenia/osteoporosis) were collected by a short version of the questionnaire Sa\u00fade, Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento (SABE, Health, Wellbeing, and Ageing), which covers many aspects of the lives of older adults, such as personal information, cognitive assessment, health status, functional status, work history, income source, mobility, and anthropometry12.\nNutritional status\nBody Mass Index (BMI) was used for classifying nutritional status.\nBody weight was measured by the electronic scale Filizola\u00ae, with maximum capacity of 180 kg and accuracy of 0.1 kg. Height was measured by the fixed stadiometer Sanny\u00ae, with a length of 2.20 m and accuracy of 0.1 cm. These measurements were used for calculating BMI [weight(kg)/height(m)2]. The nutritional status cut-off points were: underweight&lt;23 kg/m2; 23 kg/m2&lt;normal weight&lt;28 kg/m2; and obese >28 kg/m2 as suggested by Troiano et al.13\nDual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry\nBody composition was determined by the Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) device Lunar, model DPX-MD, software 4.7, using the three-compartment model (lean body mass, fat mass, and mineral mass). This technique estimates the total and compartmental body composition.\nOsteopenia/Osteoporosis\nOsteopenia and osteoporosis diagnoses were based on the bone mineral density of the proximal femur provided by the DXA device. The examination followed the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and the diagnoses were based on the criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO)14.\nSarcopenia\nSarcopenia was classified according to the Appendicular Muscle Mass Index (AMMI in kg/m2), given by the ratio appendicular muscle mass (upper limb muscle mass + lower limb muscle mass, in kilograms) to height (in square meters). Men with AMMI&lt;7.59 kg/m2 and women with AMMI&lt;5.57 kg/m2 were considered sarcopenic. These cut-off points were based on two standard deviations below the mean of a young group [n=60 (25 men and 35 women) aged 20 to 30 years, as suggested by Baumgartner et al.2.\nStatistical analysis\nThe Chi-square test analyzed whether sarcopenia was associated with the study sociodemographic factors and chronic noncommunicable diseases. Univariate binary logistic regression expressed the magnitude of the associations in Odds Ratios (OR) and respective 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI). All variables with p<0.20 in the Chi-square test were included in the multiple binary logistic regression model using the forward stepwise modeling strategy. The data were treated by the software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 at a significance level of 5%.\nR E S U L T S\nThe present sample consisted of 120 adults aged 80 to 95 years (83.4\u00b12.9 years), of which\n76 were females (83.4\u00b13 years) and 44 were males (83.4\u00b12.6 years).\nTable 1 shows the association between sarcopenia and sociodemographic factors. A greater proportion of older adults with sarcopenia were underweight (p=0.003) males (p=0.002) aged 80 to 84 years (p=0.011).\nTable 2 shows the association between sarcopenia and NDC. A greater proportion of older adults with sarcopenia had osteopenia/ osteoporosis (p=0.002).\nTable 3 shows the magnitude of the associations expressed as the odds ratio of sarcopenia for sociodemographic factors and chronic noncommunicable diseases. Males, males aged more than 85 years, underweight males, and males with osteopenia/osteoporosis are 3.68 (p=0.002), 3.17 (p=0.013), 3.34 (p=0.003), 4.33 (p=0.003) times more likely to have sarcopenia, respectively.\nTable 1.

The sociodemographic factors gender, nutritional status, and age are independently associated with sarcopenia.\nTable 5 shows the multiple model of the NCD associated with sarcopenia adjusted for age. Older adults with osteopenia/osteoporosis are 2.82 (p=0.035) times more likely to have sarcopenia regardless of age and having high blood pressure.\nD I S C U S S I O N\nThe present study aimed to analyze which sociodemographic factors and chronic noncommu-\nnicable diseases are associated with sarcopenia\nin very old adults. Osteopenia/osteoporosis, age, gender, and nutritional status were found to be associated with sarcopenia in this group.\nAge and gender are factors that can be associated with sarcopenia. Men have higher MM and higher incidence of sarcopenia than women15. Greater ageing-related MM loss in men stems from a decrease in growth hormone and testosterone16. This datum was found by Janssen et al.7 * *, who reported a prevalence of sarcopenia in older adults of 31% for women and 64% for\nmen. In New Mexico Baumgartner et al.2 found that the prevalence of sarcopenia was greater in very old adults, especially males. Our results corroborate these findings since the likelihood of this age group presenting sarcopenia is approximately three times greater than that of older adults aged 80 to 84 years, and males are approximately four times more likely to have sarcopenia than females.\nUsing Appendicular Muscle Man Index, Newman et al.17 found prevalences of sarcopenia in overweight and obese men of 8.9% and 0.0%, respectively; and in overweight and obese women, of 7.1% and 0.0%, respectively. Some years later Lee et al.10 found that sarcopenia is associated with underweight and consequently, with physical limitations in older Chinese males and females. Our finding corroborates Lee et al.10, who also found an association between sarcopenia and underweight in very old adults, who in turn were three times more likely to have the disease. Low protein intake by underweight adults may explain this association since low protein intake reduces muscle mass18.\nThe present study investigated the association between sarcopenia and education level since individuals with higher education level also have higher purchasing power, allowing them to purchase more high-protein foods, enabling them to maintain muscle mass19-20. However, no\nassociation was found between sarcopenia and education level in very old adults.\nThe prevalences of sarcopenia found in American male and female whites were 25.2% and 31.4%, respectively, and in blacks, 11.8% and 6.8%, respectively21. Lau et al.22 found prevalences of 12.3% and 7.2% in Chinese males and females aged more than 70 years, respectively. The smaller prevalence of sarcopenia found in blacks may stem from their different amount of lean body mass since blacks have more skeletal muscle at any age than whites23. Therefore, there may be ethnic differences in age-related muscle loss. However, the present study did not find an association between sarcopenia and ethnicity.\nSkeletal muscle is the main glucose consumer directly associated with insulin activity. Thus, the metabolic effects of sarcopenia include lower resting energy expenditure and fat oxidation, increasing the prevalences of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure24. Nevertheless, Lee et al.10 did not find sarcopenia to be associated with high blood pressure or diabetes. The present study did not find such associations either.\nMuscle mass seems to promote bone mass gain and maintenance because of the mechanical overload exerted by muscles on bones25. Genaro et al.26 found that sarcopenia is associated with lower femoral bone mineral density in menopausal women with osteoporosis. Di Monaco et al.27 found this same association in older Italian women who sustained a broken hip. Our result corroborates these studies since we also found an association between sarcopenia and osteopenia/osteoporosis in very old males and females. Additionally, these individuals are four times more likely to have sarcopenia.\nOne of the study limitations is the crosssectional design as it limits the ability of establishing causal relationships. However, we emphasize that studies about such aspects in adults aged 80 years or more are scarce.\nC O N C L U S I O N\nThe sociodemographic factors and chronic noncommunicable diseases independently associated with sarcopenia in adults aged 80 years and older are gender, age, nutritional status, and osteopenia/osteoporosis.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nWe thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico for the financial suport to Vanessa Ribeiro dos Santos.\nC O N T R I B U T O R S\nVR SANTOS selected the subjects; collected, analyzed and interpreted the data, and drafted, wrote, and reviewed the manuscript.
