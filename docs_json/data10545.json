Estudo in vitro.[Tese]. Ara\u00e7atuba: Universidade \n\nEstadual Paulista; 2018. \n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO GERAL \n\nO objetivo deste estudo foi sintetizar e caracterizar nanocomp\u00f3sitos formados \n\npor polifosfatos (trimetafosfato de s\u00f3dio (TMP) ou hexametafosfato de s\u00f3dio \n\n(HMP)) e fl\u00faor (F) associados \u00e0 nanopart\u00edculas de prata. Esses \n\nnanocomp\u00f3sitos foram avaliados quanto \u00e0 sua a\u00e7\u00e3o anti-biofilme de Candida \n\nalbicans (ATCC 10231) e Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175) e seu potencial \n\nem inibir a desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o do esmalte dent\u00e1rio por meio de ensaio in vitro de \n\nciclagem de pH. As nanopart\u00edculas de prata foram sintetizadas atrav\u00e9s da \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o do nitrato de prata (1 ou 10%) pelo borihidreto de s\u00f3dio (NaBH4) em \n\nmeio isoprop\u00edlico contendo trimetafosfato de s\u00f3dio (TMP) ou hexametafosfato \n\nde s\u00f3dio (HMP)) e fl\u00faor (F). Os nanocomp\u00f3sitos foram caracterizados por \n\nmicroscopia eletr\u00f4nica de varredura (MEV) e por difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X, e tamb\u00e9m \n\ndeterminada a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o inibit\u00f3ria m\u00ednima (MIC) contra c\u00e9lulas \n\nplanct\u00f4nicas de C. albicans e S. mutans. A efetividade contra biofilmes pr\u00e9-\n\nformados de 24h dos nanocomp\u00f3sitos, foi testada em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de 1x e \n\n10x os valores de MIC (de 40?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n), avaliada atrav\u00e9s da quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nc\u00e9lulas cultiv\u00e1veis (CFUs), da atividade metab\u00f3lica (XTT) e da biomassa total \n\n(Cristal Violeta). Os nanocomp\u00f3sitos contendo 10% de Ag apresentaram maior \n\nefetividade antimicrobiana contra ambos os microrganismos, comparados aos \n\nnanocomp\u00f3sitos contendo 1% de prata. O biofilme de S. mutans foi mais \n\nsuscet\u00edvel aos nanocomp\u00f3sitos TMP ou HMP/AgNP que o biofilme de C. \n\nalbicans, com redu\u00e7\u00f5es respectivas de 2,88-3,71 log10 e 0,45-1,43 log10. Os \n\nnanocomp\u00f3sitos permitiram uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de cerca de 75% da biomassa \n\ntotal e em torno de 90% da atividade metab\u00f3lica em ambos os biofilmes. Para \n\navalia\u00e7\u00e3o in vitro do potencial antic\u00e1rie, foi sintetizado um novo nanocomp\u00f3sito \n\ncontendo 0,2% de TMP, 100 ppm de fl\u00faor e 10% de Ag e caracterizado por \n\n\n\nmicroscopia eletr\u00f4nica de transmiss\u00e3o (MET).  Blocos de esmalte bovino (4 \n\nmm x 4 mm, n = 60) selecionados pela dureza superficial inicial (SHi) foram \n\nalocados em cinco grupos (n = 12): \u00e1gua deionizada (Placebo), 100 ppm F \n\n(100F), 225 ppm F (225F), 100 ppm F + 0,2% TMP (100F/TMP) e 100 ppm F + \n\n0,2% TMP + 10% Ag (100F/TMP/Ag). Os blocos foram tratados 2x ao dia com \n\nas solu\u00e7\u00f5es e submetidos a cinco ciclos de pH (solu\u00e7\u00f5es des e \n\nremineralizadora) \u00e0 37\u00b0 C. Em seguida, determinou-se a dureza superficial \n\nfinal (SHf) e a dureza subsuperficial integrada (?KHN), e a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nfluoreto (F) e c\u00e1lcio (Ca) no esmalte. A efetividade desse nanocomp\u00f3sisto \n\n(100F/TMP/Ag) contra a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de biofilmes simples e misto de C. albicans \n\n(ATCC 10231) e S. mutans (ATCC 25175) foi avaliada por meio da contagem \n\nde unidades formadoras de col\u00f4nias (CFUs). Os biofilmes foram tamb\u00e9m \n\nanalisados por microscopia eletr\u00f4nica de varredura (MEV). A dureza superficial \n\n(% SH) foi similar nas amostras tratadas com solu\u00e7\u00f5es contendo 225F, \n\n100F/TMP e 100F/TMP/Ag (p> 0,001). Al\u00e9m disso, a capacidade de reduzir o \n\ncorpo da les\u00e3o (?KHN) foi maior em 110F, 225F, 100F/TMP e 100F/TMP/Ag (p \n\n<0,001) na \u00e1rea A (5-20 ?m) e na \u00e1rea B somente com 225F e 100F/TMP. O \n\ngrupo 100F/ TMP/Ag apresentou maior desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1rea B (20-130 \n\n?m) (p&lt;0,001). A concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de F da solu\u00e7\u00e3o 100F/TMP/Ag foi semelhante \n\na 225F (p&lt;0,001). Os grupos 100F, 225F, 100F/TMP e 100F/TMP/Ag \n\napresentaram a maior e similar concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Ca (p> 0,001). A dureza \n\nsuperficial (% SH) foi similar nas amostras tratadas com solu\u00e7\u00f5es contendo \n\n225F, 100F / TMP e 100F / TMP / Ag (p> 0,001). Al\u00e9m disso, a capacidade de \n\nreduzir o corpo da les\u00e3o (?KHN) foi maior em 110F, 225F, 100F / TMP e 100F \n\n/ TMP / Ag (p&lt;0,001) na zona A (5-20 ?m) e na zona B apenas com 225F e \n\n100F / TMP. O grupo 100F / TMP / Ag apresentou maior desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\nzona B (20-130 ?m) (p&lt;0,001). A concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de F da solu\u00e7\u00e3o 100F / TMP / \n\nAg foi semelhante a 225F (p&lt;0,001). Os grupos 100F, 225F, 100F / TMP e \n\n100F / TMP / Ag apresentaram a maior e a mesma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Ca (p> \n\n0,001).Embora a solu\u00e7\u00e3o 100F/TMP/Ag tenha apresentado valores mais \n\nbaixos de \u00e1reas profundas do que a solu\u00e7\u00e3o contendo 225 ppm F, o \n\nnanocomp\u00f3sito foi capaz de inibir a desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie do esmalte. \n\nEstes nanocomp\u00f3sitos demonstraram atividade antimicrobiana significativa, \n\nespecialmente contra S. mutans, e podem ser considerados uma alternativa \n\n\n\npotencial para novos biomateriais odontol\u00f3gicos, visando a preven\u00e7\u00e3o ou \n\ntratamento de les\u00f5es cariosas. \n\nPalavras-chave: Polifosfatos; Nanopart\u00edculas de prata; Biofilmes; C\u00e1rie \n\ndent\u00e1ria; Desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o do dente. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMendes-Gouv\u00eaa CC. Antibiofilm and anticariogenic evaluation of \n\nnanocomposites formed by fluoride and sodium polyphosphates \n\nassociated with silver nanoparticles. In vitro study.[Thesis] Ara\u00e7atuba: \n\nUNESP - S\u00e3o Paulo State University; 2018.  \n\n \n\nGENERAL ABSTRACT \n\nThe aim of this study was to synthesize and characterize nanocomposites \n\nformed polyphosphates (sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) or sodium \n\nhexametaphosphate (HMP)) and fluoride (F) associated with silver \n\nnanoparticles. The anti-biofilm activity of the nanocomposites were evaluated \n\nagainst Candida albicans (ATCC ATCC 10231) and Streptococcus mutans \n\n(ATCC 25175) . as well as their potential in inhibiting demineralization and \n\nincreasing the remineralization of dental enamel by in vitro pH cycling assay. \n\nSilver nanoparticles were synthesized by reduction of silver nitrate (1 or 10%) \n\nby sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in isopropylic medium containing sodium \n\ntrimetaphosphate (TMP) or sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP)) and fluoride \n\n(F). The nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy \n\n(SEM) and X-ray diffraction. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the \n\nnanocomposites was determined against planktonic cells of C. albicans and S. \n\nmutans. Effectiveness of preformed 24-hour biofilms of nanocomposites at 1x \n\nand 10x MIC values was assessed by quantifying viable cells (CFUs), metabolic \n\nactivity (XTT) and total biomass (Crystal Violet). The nanocomposites \n\ncontaining 10% Ag showed higher antimicrobial effectiveness against both \n\nmicroorganisms compared to nanocomposites containing 1% silver. The S. \n\nmutans biofilm was more susceptible to the TMP or HMP-AgNP \n\nnanocomposites than the C. albicans biofilm, with respective reductions of 2.88-\n\n3.71 log10 and 0.45-1.43 log10. The nanocomposites allowed a reduction of \n\nabout 75% of the total biomass and about 90% of the metabolic activity in both \n\nbiofilms. For the in vitro evaluation of the anticaries potential, a new \n\nnanocomposite containing 0.2% TMP, 100 ppm fluorine and 10% Ag was \n\nsynthesized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). \n\nBovine enamel blocks (4 mm x 4 mm, n = 60) selected by initial surface \n\nhardness (SHi) were allocated in five groups (n=12): deionized water (Placebo), \n\n100 ppm F (100 F), 225 ppm F (225 F), 100 ppm F + 0.2% TMP (100 F / TMP) \n\n\n\nand 100 ppm F + 0.2% TMP + 10% Ag (100F / TMP / Ag). The blocks were \n\ntreated 2x daily with the solutions and subjected to five pH cycles \n\n(deismineralizang and remineralizing solutions) at 37 \u00b0 C. Then, the final \n\nsurface hardness (SHf) and integrated subsurface hardness (?KHN), the \n\nconcentration of fluoride (F) and calcium (Ca) in the enamel was determined. \n\nThe effectiveness of this nanocomposite (100F / TMP / Ag) against the \n\nformation of single and mixed biofilms of C. albicans (ATCC 10231) and S. \n\nmutans (ATCC 25175) was evaluated by the counting colony forming units \n\n(CFUs). Biofilms were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  \n\nSimilar values of %SH were observed for groups 225F, 100F/TMP and \n\n100F/TMP Ag (p> 0.001). The 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag solutions \n\nshowed capacity to reduce the lesion body (?KHN) in the depth of 5-20 ?m. F \n\nconcentration was similar in the enamel for the 100F/TMP/Ag and 225F (p> \n\n0.001). The groups 100F, 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag presented the \n\nhighest and the same concentration of Ca (p> 0.001). In relation to viable cells \n\n100F/TMP/Ag nanocomposite promoted significant log reductions in the number \n\nof CFUs of S. mutans, of 5.42 and 4.46 log10 respectively in single and mixed \n\nbiofilms and C. albicans was more resistant. SEM images confirmed these \n\nresults. The surface hardness (% SH) was similar in the samples treated with \n\nsolutions containing 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag (p> 0.001). In addition, \n\nthe ability to reduce the lesion body (?KHN) was greater in 110F, 225F, 100F / \n\nTMP and 100F/TMP/Ag (p&lt;0.001) in zone A (5-20 ?m) and in zone B only with \n\n225F and 100F/TMP. The 100F/TMP/Ag group showed greater \n\ndemineralization in zone B (20-130 ?m) (p&lt;0.001). The F concentration of the \n\n100F/TMP/Ag solution was similar to 225F (p&lt;0.001). Groups 100F, 225F, \n\n100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag showed the highest and the same concentration \n\nof Ca (p> 0.001).Although the 100F/TMP/Ag solution yielded lower values of \n\nlesion deep areas than the solution containing 225 ppm F, but the \n\nnanocomposite was able to inhibit demineralization of surface of enamel. These \n\ncompounds have demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity, especially \n\nagainst S. mutans, and can be considered a potential alternative for new dental \n\nbiomaterials, aiming at the prevention or treatment of carious lesions.  \n\n \n\n\n\nKeywords: Polyphosphates; Silver nanoparticles; Biofilms; Dental caries; Tooth \n\ndemineralization. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLISTA DE FIGURAS \n\nCapter 1: Sodium trimetaphosphate and hexametaphosphate impregnated \n\nwith silver nanoparticles: characteristics and antimicrobial efficacy \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - XRD patterns of commercial TMP (a) and HMP powder (b) and \n\nthe synthesized nanocomposites, respectively\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202624 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - SEM images and EDX mapping in 2-D at different \n\nmagnifications of T10 (a and b) and H10 (c and d).

INTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O GERAL \n\nA c\u00e1rie dent\u00e1ria \u00e9 considerada a doen\u00e7a mais prevalente nos seres \n\nhumanos, atingindo 80-90% da popula\u00e7\u00e3o mundial [Petersen, 2004]. Sua \n\netiologia j\u00e1 foi descrita como multifatorial por alguns autores [Keyes, 1960; \n\nNewbrune, 1978], enquanto outros defendiam ter um fator causador principal, \n\ncomo na revis\u00e3o de Sheiham e James [Sheiham and James, 2015], na qual \n\nafirmam ser o a\u00e7\u00facar o fator fundamental para o desenvolvimento desta \n\ndoen\u00e7a. Mas o que \u00e9 universalmente aceito \u00e9 que a agress\u00e3o \u00e0 superf\u00edcie \n\ndental \u00e9 causada pela a\u00e7\u00e3o do Streptococcus mutans [Hamada and Slade, \n\n1980] uma bact\u00e9ria Gram \n+\n, mais frequentemente encontrada no biofilme \n\naderido \u00e0 superf\u00edcie do esmalte. \n\nA patogenicidade do S. mutans, se d\u00e1 primeiramente pela alta \n\ncapacidade de formar biofilmes em superf\u00edcies s\u00f3lidas [Huang et al., 2013; \n\nShimotoyodome et al., 2007; Tamura et al., 2009]. O aumento da virul\u00eancia das \n\nc\u00e9lulas de S. mutans ao formar biofilme tamb\u00e9m pode estar associado a uma \n\nmaior toler\u00e2ncia ao baixo pH, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com culturas planct\u00f4nicas \n\n[Krzysciak et al., 2014]. No biofilme dental o S. mutans \u00e9 um dos principais \n\nprodutores de subst\u00e2ncias polim\u00e9ricas extracelulares, os exopolissacar\u00eddeos \n\n(EPS). Uma matriz rica em EPS proporciona estabilidade e coes\u00e3o mec\u00e2nica \n\nao biofilme e permite a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de microambientes altamente \u00e1cidos, que s\u00e3o \n\ncr\u00edticos para a patog\u00eanese da c\u00e1rie dent\u00e1ria [Klein et al., 2015]. Contudo, o \n\nprincipal fator de virul\u00eancia dessa bact\u00e9ria \u00e9 a secre\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos [Banas, \n\n2004], os quais levam \u00e0 desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o do esmalte dent\u00e1rio e o \n\naparecimento da les\u00e3o inicial de c\u00e1rie. \n\nOutros microrganismos tamb\u00e9m est\u00e3o relacionados com a doen\u00e7a c\u00e1rie, \n\ncomo a esp\u00e9cie f\u00fangica Candida albicans, que apresenta importante papel \n\ncomo agente secund\u00e1rio, sendo respons\u00e1vel pela progress\u00e3o do processo \n\ncarioso. De acordo com Pereira et al (2018) [Pereira et al., 2018], este fungo \n\npossui enzimas proteol\u00edticas que contribuem para a colagen\u00f3lise, evoluindo a \n\ndoen\u00e7a particularmente para a c\u00e1rie dentin\u00e1ria. Al\u00e9m disso, h\u00e1 ind\u00edcios que a \n\nC. albicans tem a capacidade de aderir a hidroxiapatita por meio de intera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\neletrost\u00e1tica, e podendo levar a dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o desse mineral [Nikawa et al., 2003]. \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nO amplo espectro de a\u00e7\u00e3o contra microrganismos [Xiu et al., 2012] torna \n\na prata um metal amplamente utilizado na preven\u00e7\u00e3o da coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ndispositivos m\u00e9dicos [Balazs et al., 2004; Monteiro et al., 2009], em curativos \n\nde feridas [Bjarnsholt et al., 2007; Gauger et al., 2003], em tratamentos de \n\nqueimaduras [Khundkar et al., 2010; Ulkur et al., 2005]. Em sua forma \n\nnanoparticulada, a prata (AgNP) mostrou-se maior efic\u00e1cia antimicrobiana por \n\nser mais reativa [Panacek et al., 2006] e permitir uma maior \u00e1rea de contato e \n\nconsequente intera\u00e7\u00e3o com bact\u00e9rias e fungos [Lok CN, 2006; Morones et al., \n\n2005].  \n\nO fl\u00faor (F) foi o principal agente utilizado na preven\u00e7\u00e3o da c\u00e1rie dent\u00e1ria, \n\npodendo ser utilizado de forma sist\u00eamica, nas \u00e1guas de abastecimento p\u00fablico, \n\nou de forma t\u00f3pica como uso em dentifr\u00edcios, g\u00e9is, enxaguat\u00f3rios ou vernizes. \n\nO F tem uma a\u00e7\u00e3o importante ao manter o equil\u00edbrio mineral dos dentes, \n\nagindo na din\u00e2mica do processo de desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o e remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndent\u00e1ria [Ten Cate, 1990]. A descoberta das propriedades do F em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 \n\npreven\u00e7\u00e3o da c\u00e1rie dent\u00e1ria pode ser considerada um marco na odontologia \n\npreventiva, e nesse sentido estudos vem sendo realizados visando  melhorar a \n\nefic\u00e1cia do F adicionando-o em produtos de higiene bucal e materiais \n\nrestauradores provis\u00f3rios.  \n\nMcGaughey and Stowell (1977) [McGaughey and Stowell, 1977], \n\ndivulgaram a efici\u00eancia de outros agentes, como os polifosfatos, capazes de \n\nmodificar a superf\u00edcie da hidroxiapatita atrav\u00e9s de sua adsor\u00e7\u00e3o, diminuindo a \n\nperda mineral e aumentando o processo de remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o.

The minimum inhibitory \n\nconcentration (MIC) was determined, which was followed by the quantification \n\nof the biofilm by counting colony-forming units (CFUs), the amount of metabolic \n\nactivity, and the total biomass. The MICs revealed greater effectiveness of \n\ncomposites containing 10% Ag (TMP + Ag10% (T10) and HMP + Ag10% (H10)) \n\nagainst both microorganisms. It was observed that T10 and H10 reduced the \n\nformation of biofilms by 56\u201376% for C. albicans and by 52\u201394% for S. mutans \n\nfor total biomass and metabolic activity. These composites promoted significant \n\nlog reductions in the number of CFUs, between 0.45\u20131.43 log10 for C. albicans \n\nand 2.88\u20133.71 log10 for S. mutans (p &lt;.001). These composites demonstrated \n\nsignificant antimicrobial activity, especially against S. mutans, and may be \n\nconsidered a potential alternative for new dental materials. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nStreptococcus mutans is the main cariogenic microorganism, and its \n\ncapacity to produce acid and survive at low pH, as well as its ability to \n\nsynthesize extracellular polysaccharides, are important virulence factors which \n\ncontribute to the colonization of the tooth surface, development of pathogenic \n\nbiofilms, and enamel demineralization  (Leone et al. 2008, Li and Chang 2008; \n\nDelbem et al. 2014). Although the development of dental caries is related to the \n\nformation of biofilm, the progression of established lesions may include species \n\nof Candida, particularly Candida albicans (Shibata and Morioka 1982; Monteiro \n\net al. 2015).  \n\nComposites containing calcium and phosphate have shown promising \n\nanticariostatic effects (do Amaral et al. 2013; Takeshita et al. 2015; da Camara \n\net al. 2016). Among the phosphate salts, sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) and \n\nsodium hexametaphosphate (HMP) have been effective in reducing enamel \n\ndemineralization and improving remineralization. They are inorganic \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\ncyclophosphates with the capacity to adsorb hydroxyapatite and protein through \n\nhydroxyl (Souza et al. 2013; Delbem et al. 2014) and amino (Leone et al. 2008; \n\nLi and Chang 2008) attachment sites. Added to low concentrations of fluoride in \n\nan appropriate proportion in oral health products, they provide a greater \n\nprotective effect than conventional fluoride products (da Camara et al. 2014; \n\nManarelli et al. 2015; Takeshita et al. 2015; Conceicao et al. 2015; da Camara \n\net al. 2016). \n\n The development of multifunctional biomaterials to be used in the health \n\nfield is the focus of increasing attention. Added to that, the exponential growth \n\nof nanotechnology, and the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) as an \n\nantimicrobial agent allowing for increased surface-to-volume ratios and specific \n\ninteractions with species of bacteria and fungi (Baker et al. 2005, Morones et al. \n\n2005; Lok et al. 2006), new approaches could be useful to prevent and control \n\ndental caries. A material containing AgNP as an antimicrobial agent, and \n\nsources of fluoride and phosphate to prevent the demineralization of dental \n\nenamel could achieve promising results. Thus, this study aimed to synthesize \n\ncomposites containing AgNP, F, and TMP or HMP, and to characterize and \n\nevaluate their effect against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSynthesis and characterization of the nanocomposites \n\nNanocomposites were synthesized based on the protocol proposed by \n\nMiranda et al. (2010), with some modifications. The synthesis was carried out in \n\nan alcoholic medium (isopropanol) using sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma-\n\nAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) as a reducing agent. Suspensions containing \n\nsodium trimetaphosphate (TMP, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS 7785-84-4) or sodium \n\nhexametaphosphate (HMP, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS 68915-31-1), fluoride (NaF, \n\nMerck, Darmstadt, Germany), and silver nitrate (AgNO3, Merck) were prepared \n\nin the presence of a surfactant (ammonium salt of polymethacrylic acid (NHPM), \n\nPolysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). AgNO3 was employed at 1% or 10% \n\nof the phosphate weight. The molar proportions between phosphates and \n\nfluoride was 1.2:1 TMP/NaF or 0.62:1 HMP/NaF, and between silver ions (Ag\n+\n) \n\nand NaBH4 it was 1:1.26. Samples were dried overnight at 70\u00b0C. AgNP with no \n\npolyphosphates was also synthesized.  \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nThe morphology of the nanocomposites was characterized by scanning \n\nelectron microscopy (SEM) on a Zeiss Supra 35VP microscope (S-360 \n\nmicroscope, Leo, MA, USA) with field emission gun electron effect (FEG-SEM, \n\n10 kV). A drop of each sample was placed on a silicon substratum and dried at \n\n40\u00b0C for 12 h. Two-dimensional images were constructed by analyzing the P \n\nK?, Ag L?1, and O K? energy emissions using energy dispersive X-ray detector \n\n(EDX) analysis with mapping. Samples were also characterized by X-ray \n\ndiffraction (XRD) (Rigaku diffractometer [Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan], \n\nDMax 2500PC) with CuK radiation (? = 1.5406 A) generated at a voltage of 40 \n\nkV and a current of 40 mA. The scanning range (2?) was from 20\u00b0 to 110\u00b0 with \n\na step size of 0.2\u00b0, a 1.0 mm divergent slit, 0.2 mm collection slot, and \n\naccumulation for reading every 0.02 s. \n\n \n\nDetermination of Ag\n+\n concentration \n\nThe concentration of Ag\n+\n in the composites was determined by a 9616 \n\nBNWP (Thermo Scientific, Beverly, MA, USA) ion-specific electrode coupled to \n\nan ion analyzer (Orion 720 A\n+\n, Thermo Scientific). One thousand ?g Ag ml\n\n?1\n \n\nwere prepared (1.57 g of dried AgNO3 for 1 l of deionized water) as a standard, \n\nand diluted in deionized water to achieve equivalent silver concentrations in the \n\ncomposites. Thus, the combined electrode was calibrated with solutions \n\ncontaining 6.25 to 100 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n. A silver ionic strength adjuster solution (ISA, \n\nCat. No. 940011), which provides a constant background ionic strength was \n\nused (1 ml of each sample/standard: 0.02 ml of ISA). \n\n \n\nMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) \n\nThe microdilution method was performed following the Clinical \n\nLaboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI: M27-A2 and M07-A9). The \n\nnanocomposites were diluted in deionized water in geometric progression, from \n\n2 to 1,024 times. Afterwards, each nanocomposite concentration obtained \n\npreviously was diluted (1:5) in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) for Candida \n\nalbicans (ATCC 10231), and in brain heart infusion (BHI, Difco, Le Pont de \n\nClaix, France) for Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175). Inocula from 24-h \n\ncultures were adjusted to the 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity equivalent in \n\nsaline solution (0.85% NaCl). Suspensions of each strain were diluted (1:5) in \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nsaline and subsequently diluted (1:20) in RPMI 1640 for C. albicans or BHI \n\nbroth for S. mutans. Each microorganism suspension (100 ?l) was added in the \n\nwells of microtiter plates containing 100 ?l of each nanocomposite \n\nconcentration. Polyphosphate/fluoride, AgNP, and chlorhexidine gluconate \n\n(CHG) (Periogard-Colgate, New York, NY, USA) were tested as controls. The \n\nmicrotiter plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, and the MICs were determined \n\nvisually as the lowest concentration of nanocomposites with no microorganism \n\ngrowth after 48 h. \n\n \n\nBiofilm formation and treatment \n\nSingle species biofilms were grown in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, \n\nCorning Incorporated, Tewksbury, MA, USA) containing 0.2 ml of C. albicans \n\ncell suspension (1 \u00d7 10\n7\n cells ml\n\n?1\n in artificial saliva) (Silva et al. 2010) or 0.2 ml \n\nof S. mutans (1 \u00d7 10\n8 \n\ncells ml\n?1\n\n in artificial saliva) (Arias et al. 2016). The plates \n\nwere incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. After this period, the biofilm-containing wells \n\nwere washed with 0.2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7, 0.1 M) to \n\nremove the non-adherent cells. Next, the nanocomposites were added to the \n\nbiofilms at concentrations based on the MIC values obtained previously. For \n\nthis, 0.2 ml of the T10 and H10 nanocomposites at MIC and 10 \u00d7 MIC were \n\ndiluted in artificial saliva, which was added to the biofilm-containing wells. AgNP \n\nwith no phosphates and CHG at 0.018% (positive control) were also tested \n\nagainst the biofilms, and artificial saliva with no nanocomposites was used as \n\nnegative control. The biofilms were then re-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. \n\n \n\nBiofilm quantification \n\nThe quantification of C. albicans and S. mutans cultivable cells from \n\nbiofilms treated with T10 and H10 was carried out by counting colony-forming \n\nunits (CFUs). For this, the biofilm-containing wells were scraped with a tip, \n\nusing 0.2 ml of PBS each time five times, totaling 1 ml of suspension, and the \n\ncell suspensions were then placed in Falcon tubes. The suspensions were \n\nvortexed and serially diluted in PBS and plated on SDA (C. albicans) or BHI (S. \n\nmutans). \n\n After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h for C. albicans and 48 h for S. mutans, \n\nthe total number of CFUs was counted and the log CFU per unit area (log10 \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nCFU cm\n?2\n\n) was determined. After the biofilms were treated, the total biomass \n\nwas analyzed by the crystal violet (CV) method (Monteiro et al. 2015). The \n\nbiofilms were washed with 0.2 ml of PBS and fixed by adding 0.2 ml of 99% \n\nmethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. The methanol was then removed and the \n\nwells were allowed to dry at room temperature. Then, 0.2 ml of CV (1%, v v\n\u20131\n\n, \n\nMerck) were added into each well, and after 5 min, the excess was withdrawn \n\nby washing each well-plate with deionized water. CV bound to the biofilms was \n\neluted using 0.2 ml of acetic acid (33%, v v\n\u20131\n\n, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), and the \n\nabsorbance was measured in a microtiter-plate reader (Eon Microplate \n\nSpectrophotometer; Bio Tek, Winooski, VT, USA) at 570 nm, and standardized \n\nin relation to the area of the well-plate (Abs 570 nm cm?2). \n\n Metabolic activity was assessed by the XTT reduction assay (2,3-bis (2-\n\nmethoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium \n\nhydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich). Biofilm-containing wells were washed once with 0.2 \n\nml of PBS and 0.2 ml of the solution containing 150 mg XTT l\n?1\n\n and 10 mg of \n\nphenazine methosulfate l\n?1\n\n in each well. The plates were then incubated at \n\n37\u00b0C, under agitation at 120 rpm, in the dark. After 3 h, the absorbance was \n\nread at 490 nm cm\n?2\n\n. All assays were performed, independently and in \n\ntriplicate, on three different occasions. \n\n \n\nMicroscopy \n\nThe structural analysis of single biofilms of C. albicans and S. mutans \n\nexposed to the nanocomposites was verified by SEM. Briefly, the biofilms were \n\nformed in 24-well plates as described before. Then, the T10 and H10 \n\nnanocomposites were added to the wells at the concentration of 10/100 ?g Ag \n\nml\n?1\n\n for C. albicans and 40/400 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n for S. mutans biofilms. After \n\ntreatment for 24 h, the wells were washed with PBS and the biofilms were \n\ndehydrated using an ethanol concentration series (70% for 10 min, 95% for 10 \n\nmin, and 100% for 20 min), followed by air drying for 20 min (Silva et al. 2013). \n\nThe bottom of the wells were cut with a scalpel blade (number 11, Solidor, \n\nLamedid Commercial and Services Ltda, Barueri, Brazil) heated in flame, and \n\nthe biofilms were coated with gold for scanning with the electron microscope (S-\n\n360 microscope, Leo, Cambridge, MA, USA) (Fernandes et al. 2016). \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nSigmaPlot 12.0 software (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) was \n\nused for statistical analysis; the significance level was set at 5%. CFUs, CV (for \n\nboth microorganisms tested), and XTT (C. albicans) data exhibited a normal \n\nand homogeneous distribution (Shapiro\u2013Wilks test) and were submitted to one-\n\nway analysis of variance, followed by the Fisher test. XTT data from S. mutans \n\nwere submitted to logarithmic transformation and one-way analysis of variance \n\nfollowed by the Fisher test. \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\nSynthesis, characterization, and Ag+ determination in the \n\nnanocomposites \n\nXRD and SEM demonstrated the association of silver nanoparticles in \n\nboth polyphosphates (sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) and sodium \n\nhexametaphosphate (HMP). The typical XRD pattern of the prepared T1 \n\n(TMP+Ag1%) and T10 (TMP+Ag10%) powder showed diffraction peaks at 2? = \n\n14.4\u00b0, 17.3\u00b0, 23.4\u00b0, 26.1\u00b0, and 29.2\u00b0, and the corresponding crystallographic \n\nform (PDF ? 72\u20131628) of the TMP salt (Figure 1a). Figure 1a shows diffraction \n\npeaks at 2? = 38.2\u00b0, 44.4\u00b0, and 64.6\u00b0, which can be indexed to (2 0 0), (1 1 1), \n\nand (2 2 0) planes of pure silver with the face centered cubic system (PDF ? \n\n04\u20130783). Figure 1b shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of HMP that present a \n\nwide halo between 15\u00b0 and 35\u00b0, characteristic of amorphous materials. The X-\n\nray diffraction patterns of H1 (HMP+Ag1%) and H10 (HMP+Ag10%) indicate \n\nsodium hexametaphosphate salt \u2013 (NaPO3)6 (PDF ? 3643), and suggest the \n\npresence of other polyphosphate salts, such as (NaH2PO4. (H2O), NaH2PO4, \n\nNa5P3O10, NaPO3, and Na2H2P2O7, by comparing the experimentally obtained \n\nXRD patterns with standard patterns (PDF ? 11\u2013651, 11\u2013659, 11\u2013652, 76\u2013\n\n788, and 11\u2013657). SEM images of T10 and H10 (Figure 2) show silver \n\nnanoparticles (white shades) dispersed and decorating the surface of the \n\nphosphates at micrometric size (gray shades). AgNP anchored on the surface \n\nof HMP or TMP were more evident in samples containing Ag at 10% than at 1% \n\nof Ag. The 2-D images were constructed by analyzing the energy released from \n\nthe O K?, P K? (constituents of the TMP and HMP material) and Ag K? \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nemissions, indicating the uniform distribution of these elements in the \n\ndemarcated area in the micrograph.  \n\nThe total amount of Ag\n+\n (from the AgNO3 source) added to the reaction \n\nto obtain AgNP with no TMP or HMP was 20,000 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n, and the ionic \n\nconcentration was determined by electrode method at 576.19 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n, thus a \n\nreduction of 97.12% of ionic silver was observed. All samples containing Ag at \n\n1% (H1 and T1) or 10% (H10 and T10) presented Ag\n+\n % reduction between \n\n98.04 and 99.85%. For H1 and T1 samples, the Ag concentrations were \n\ndetermined as 1.43 and 8.13 ?g Ag\n+\n ml\n\n?1\n, and the total amount of Ag used in \n\nthe reaction was 1,000 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n. For H10 and T10 samples, the Ag \n\nconcentrations were 129.8 and 195.4 ?g Ag\n+\n ml\n\n?1\n, and the total amount of Ag \n\nused in the reaction was 10,000 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n. \n\n \n\nAntimicrobial effect \n\nThe nanocomposites were effective against both strains tested in \n\nplanktonic form (Table 1). Composites containing Ag at 10% (T10 and H10) \n\nwere more effective against C. albicans (10 ?g Ag V) than against S. mutans \n\n(40 ?g Ag V), while at 1% Ag only H1 presented an effect against the \n\nmicroorganisms (80 ?g Ag V). For the group of AgNP without TMP or HMP \n\nsynthesized in the same conditions, the MIC values were 62.5 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n for C. \n\nalbicans and 125 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n for S. mutans. At lower Ag concentration (1%), \n\nonly H1 presented an antimicrobial effect. In this study, biofilm cells of C. \n\nalbicans were resistant to all concentrations tested of AgNP without phosphates \n\n(Figure 3). However, after adding the polyphosphates to the AgNP, there were \n\nsignificant reductions of 1.43 log10 in the C. albicans biofilm treated with T10, \n\nand 1.17 log10 treated with H10 (100 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n) (Figure 3a), when compared to \n\nthe negative control group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.014). Surprisingly, S. mutans \n\nbiofilm cells were more susceptible to T10 and H10 than the C. albicans biofilm \n\ncells, and they were similar to the CHG positive control (PC) (Figure 3a). \n\nNotably, there was a reduction of 4.2 log10 in the S. mutans biofilm at the lowest \n\nconcentration (40 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n) of T10.  \n\nThe total biomass quantification and metabolic activity in the C. albicans \n\nand S. mutans biofilms are shown in Figure 3b and c. Significant reductions (~ \n\n75%) in the total biomass of both microorganisms were observed in the lowest \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nconcentrations of T10 (10 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n) and H10 (40 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n), being similar to \n\nCHG (PC) (Figure 3b). Notably, the metabolic activity (Figure 3c) of C. albicans \n\nbiofilm was reduced (93.4\u201394.4%) at both 10 and 100 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n of T10 and at \n\n100 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\nof H10 (92.0%). T10 and H10 nanocomposites reduced the \n\nmetabolic activity of S. mutans biofilms by ~ 90%, at all concentrations tested. \n\n \n\nMicroscopy \n\nFigure 4 shows hyphal cell density similar to the negative control in all C. \n\nalbicans biofilms exposed to nanocomposites T10 and H10, while a reduction in \n\ncellular biomass was observed in biofilm treated with chlorhexidine gluconate. \n\nOn the other hand, the quantity of cells in the S. mutans biofilms treated with \n\nT10 and H10 was as suppressed as in the biofilm subjected to chlorhexidine \n\ngluconate treatment (Figure 5). \n\n \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThis study evaluated the antimicrobial action of nanocomposites against \n\nstrains of C. albicans and S. mutans in both the planktonic form and in biofilms \n\ngrown for 24 h. Analyses included the quantification of viable cells, total \n\nbiomass, and metabolic activity.  \n\nCurrently, there are several studies in the literature that show the \n\nmechanism of action of silver nanoparticles. As has already been \n\ndemonstrated, silver nanoparticles promote direct damage to the cellular \n\nmembrane by adhering to it (Li et al. 2008) or by dissolving it through the \n\nrelease of silver ions (Kon and Rai 2013). Then, once inside the cell of the \n\nmicroorganism, silver nanoparticles can lead to DNA damage (Li et al. 2008), \n\nmainly via production of ROS (Marambio-Jones and Hoek 2010; Duran et al. \n\n2016), and can also affect the electrochemical proton gradient through the \n\nrespiratory process, which could discontinue the ATP synthesis, leading to the \n\ndeath of the microorganism cell (Reidy et al. 2013). \n\nThe combination of silver nanoparticles with other compounds may \n\nimprove their antimicrobial activity (Pal et al. 2007; Monteiro et al. 2013). The \n\nresults of the present study demonstrated that the association of AgNP with \n\nTMP or HMP did not hinder the antimicrobial silver effect, but the association of \n\nAg and polyphosphates resulted in similar MICs at a lower Ag concentration \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n(Table 1). The crystallographic surface structures of AgNP are an important \n\nphysico-chemical property which is related to their antibacterial activity (Pal et \n\nal. 2007), and could be changed when associated with those polyphosphates. \n\nThe composites were more effective against planktonic cells of C. albicans (10 \n\n?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n) than S. mutans (40 Ag ml\n?1\n\n) when the Ag concentration was 10% \n\n(T10 and H10), while at 1%, just H1 showed an antimicrobial effect (80 ?g Ag \n\nml\n?1\n\n). HMP has the ability to increase outer membrane cell permeability \n\n(Shibata and Morioka 1982; Vaara and Jaakkola 1989), and it might facilitate Ag \n\nentrance into the microorganism cells. Indeed, the polyphosphate property of \n\nadsorption on protein by hydroxyl and amino sites (Leone et al. 2008; Li and \n\nChang 2008) may increase Ag availability and improve the antimicrobial effect \n\nof those composites. This was observed especially for T10 (TMP+Ag10%) and \n\nH10, (HMP+Ag10%) which have a higher Ag concentration impregnated on the \n\nphosphates. H1 (HMP+Ag1%) alone was shown to be effective against both \n\nplanktonic strains. These results demonstrate that not only was the amount of \n\nAg relevant for the antimicrobial effectiveness of the composites, but its \n\nassociation with the phosphates had a significant role in the increase in the \n\nantimicrobial potential of the TMP/HMP-AgNP nanocomposites. This has also \n\nbeen demonstrated by Humphreys et al. (2011) and the synergism between \n\npolyphosphates and silver might increase the permeability of the outer \n\nmembrane of bacteria associated to sequestration of divalent cations by \n\npolyphosphate (Maier et al. 1999; Akhtar et al. 2008; Obritsch et al. 2008), \n\nenabling silver to pass through the membrane and then causing damage to the \n\ncell, such as loss of DNA replication and protein inactivation (Feng et al. 2000). \n\n The greater susceptibility of planktonic cells of C. albicans in comparison \n\nto S. mutans planktonic cells can be primarily explained by the structural \n\ndifferences in their cell membranes (Malanovic and Lohner 2016). Membranes \n\nof bacteria are negatively charged due to anionic phospholipids, while the \n\ncharge in fungal membranes is neutral, constituted by zwitterionic phospholipids \n\nand ergosterol. The work of Abbaszadegan et al. (2015) states that the \n\nantimicrobial action of the nanoparticle shelf depends on the charge of the \n\nexternal surface of the particles as influenced by the stabilizers and capping \n\nagents used in the synthesis; thus, the AgNP fabricated in the present study \n\ncan be considered negatively charged. According to Mandal et al. (2016), the \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nmechanism of AgNP action depends on the outer charge of the bacterial \n\nmembranes, and this may explain the decreased susceptibility of S. mutans. \n\nFurthermore, the physical and chemical properties of the AgNP related to the \n\nrelease of Ag\n+\n ions are noteworthy. It seemed that AgNP were more clearly \n\nadhered to the surface of TMP than the surface of HPM (Figure 2a and c). This \n\ncould facilitate the release of Ag\n+\n ions, and hence, its highest concentration in \n\nthe composites containing TMP, regardless of the amount of AgNO3 (1 or 10%) \n\nused in the synthesis reaction. On the other hand, it did not increase the \n\nantimicrobial effectiveness of the T10, suggesting antimicrobial activity is not \n\njust related to the amount of Ag\n+\n ions released from that composite.  \n\nHowever, many antimicrobial agents that show effectiveness against \n\nplanktonic cells could be ineffective against the same microorganism grown in a \n\nbiofilm (Jefferson 2004; Kim et al. 2008). Biofilms of Candida species, for \n\nexample, can exhibit up to 65 times more tolerance to killing by metals than \n\ncorresponding planktonic cultures (Harrison et al. 2007). Although biofilms of C. \n\nalbicans showed tolerance against pure AgNP (Figure 3a), the addition of the \n\npolyphosphates resulted in inhibition of the growth of fungal biofilms. The same \n\noccurred against biofilm cells of S. mutans. Nevertheless, the microscopy \n\nimages (Figures 4 and 5) show that growth of C. albicans biofilm cells was \n\nsimilar to the negative control, while the reduction in biofilm cells of S. mutans \n\nwas consistent with chlorhexidine gluconate, as shown through CFU analysis. \n\nThe explanation would also be related to the mechanism of action of \n\npolyphosphates on planktonic cells (Maier et al. 1999; Akhtar et al. 2008; \n\nObritsch et al. 2008), and also for a probable buffer effect promoted by the \n\nphosphates in the S. mutans biofilm environment. To this end, as S. mutans is \n\nan acidogenic and aciduric bacterial strain, TMP and HMP may have hampered \n\nthe decrease in pH, and hence, the proliferation of the cells in the biofilm. \n\n The total biomass and metabolic activity of fungal and bacterial biofilms \n\nare shown in Figure 3b and c. Overall, the methods used to quantify microbial \n\nbiofilms were performed as complementary analysis. As shown in the results, \n\nthe lowest concentrations of T10 (10 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n) and H10 (40 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n) were \n\nable to reduce the total biomass in a manner similar to the positive control \n\n(CHG). Figure 3c shows the reduction in biofilm activity of C. albicans of \n\nbetween 92 and 94.4%, with the exception of the concentration of 10 ?g Ag ml\n?1\n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nH10. All concentrations of both T10 and H10 reduced the biofilm biomass of S. \n\nmutans by ~ 90%. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that  S. mutans may not have \n\nproperly absorbed and/or metabolized the salt of XTT (Kuhn et al. 2003; Gobor \n\net al. 2011), and hence, interfered with the spectrophotometer reading since \n\nthere was also low metabolic activity in the negative control group (NC).  \n\nFinally, looking at the antimicrobial effect of the polyphosphates TMP or \n\nHMP-AgNP in comparison with AgNP alone, the findings of the present study \n\ndemonstrate that both TMP and HMP with a very low NaF concentration \n\nsubstantially improved the effectiveness of AgNP against both the planktonic \n\nand sessile forms of the microorganism. This suggests that AgNP associated \n\nwith TMP or HMP polyphosphates and fluoride may be effective antimicrobial \n\nbiomaterials for promising applications to control caries disease. Future studies \n\nshould investigate the remineralization potential of these composites as well as \n\ntheir toxicity to make their incorporation in dental materials feasible. Studies \n\nconsidering different approaches to investigate the mechanisms of action of \n\nthese nanocomposites would also be opportune. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nIn this study, nanocomposites formed by AgNP associated with TMP or \n\nHMP polyphosphates and very low concentrations of fluoride were synthesized. \n\nThe antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effectiveness of these nanocomposites were \n\nobserved against S. mutans and C. albicans, both relevant dental caries \n\npathogens. Furthermore, the results suggest that TMP and HMP improved the \n\nantimicrobial potential of AgNP, enabling the use of smaller amounts of AgNP to \n\nproduce more biocompatible nanomaterials, which would be effective at \n\nreducing caries \u2013inducing pathogens and increasing the dental remineralization \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAbbaszadegan A, Ghahramani Y, Gholami A, Hemmateenejad B, Dorostkar S, \n\nNabavizadeh M, Sharghi H. 2015.

Methods: The nanocomposite contains \n\nthe following compounds 0.2% TMP, 100 ppm F, and 10% Ag (100F/TMP/Ag). \n\nBovine enamel blocks (4 mm x 4 mm, n=60) selected by the initial surface \n\nhardness (SHi) were followed allocated (n=12): deionized water (Placebo), \n\n100ppmF (100F), 225 ppmF (225F), 100ppmF + 0.2%TMP (100F/TMP) and \n\n100 ppmF + 0.2%TMP + 10%Ag (100F/TMP/Ag). Blocks were treated twice a \n\nday, and submitted to five pH cycles (demineralizing/remineralizing solutions). \n\nThe surface hardness loss (%SH), integrated loss of subsurface hardness \n\n(?KHN), fluoride (F) and calcium (Ca) in enamel were measured. The anti-\n\nbiofilm effect of 100F/TMP/Ag was assessed through counting of colony forming \n\nunits (CFUs), and structural analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. \n\nResults: 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP Ag showed similar values of %SH \n\n(p> 0.001). 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag groups were able to reduce the \n\nlesion body (?KHN) in the depth of 5-20 ?m. F concentration in enamel was \n\nsimilar for 100F/TMP/Ag and 225F (p> 0.001). 100F, 225F, 100F/TMP and \n\n100F/TMP/Ag presented the highest and the same concentration of Ca (p> \n\n0.001). 100F/TMP/Ag promoted significant reduction (p&lt;0.001) of  cultivable \n\ncells of S. mutans of 5.42 and 4.46 log10 in single and mixed biofilms \n\nrespectively, while C. albicans demonstrated more resistance. Conclusion: The \n\naddition of Ag to F/TMP did not interfere on the demineralization of enamel \n\nsurface and inhibits significantly the biofilm formation regarding to the main \n\nrelevant bacteria of dental caries, stimulating researches including its use in \n\nprevention or treatment of carious lesions. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Dental caries; Polyphosphates; Silver nanoparticles; Biofilms \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nDental caries is a multifactorial disease and can be considered as a \n\nconsequence of the metabolic activity of the microorganisms present in the \n\ndental biofilm specially the microorganisms that produce acids, as consequence \n\nof their expression of factors of virulence [Krzysciak et al., 2014]. The presence \n\nof biofilm on  dental surface is the indispensable factor for the development of \n\nthis disease [Nyvad et al., 2013]. It is known that Streptococcus mutans is the \n\nmain microorganism involved in the occurrence of caries, since it is capable of \n\nproducing acids and survive in this environmental, synthesizing polysaccharides  \n\nand decreasing the oral pH , being these important virulence factors that lead to \n\nthe demineralization of dental enamel [Fejerskov O, 2005]. Candida albicans, a \n\nfungus species frequently found in the oral cavity, plays an significant role as a \n\nsecondary agent and it is strong involved in the progression of the caries \n\nprocess, since this fungus has the capacity to produce enzymes as factors of \n\nvirulence, specially the proteolytic enzymes which contribute to collagenolysis, \n\nparticularly in dentinal caries [Pereira et al., 2018]. \n\nIn this sense, silver,  present an antimicrobial effect in broad-spectrum \n\n[Xiu et al., 2012], and has been  tested as antimicrobial agent [Balazs et al., \n\n2004; Bjarnsholt et al., 2007; Monteiro et al., 2009; Panacek et al., 2006] in \n\nwound dressings, burn treatments, creams, and coatings on medical devices  to \n\nprevent the microorganism colonization on the surfaces of these materials. In its \n\nnanoparticulate form, silver particles (AgNP) have showed considerable \n\nantimicrobial efficacy for allowing greater contact of its volume and so \n\nincreasing its interaction with bacteria and fungi [Lok CN, 2006; Morones et al., \n\n2005]. \n\nThe anticaries activity of phosphate salts, specially sodium \n\ntrimetaphosphate (TMP), has already been considered  effective against \n\nenamel demineralization [Danelon et al., 2014; Manarelli et al., 2011; Takeshita \n\net al., 2016; Takeshita et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2011]. Takeshita et al \n\n(2011).[Takeshita et al., 2011] confirmed the potential of TMP as a preventive \n\nagent  of caries, particularly in cases where fluoride use should be limited. \n\nDanelon et al (2014).[Danelon et al., 2014], it is ensured that the sodium \n\ntrimetaphosphate supplied  with different concentrations of fluoride (F) was able \n\nto decrease the mineral loss and increase the remineralization process, due to \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nits ability to modify the surface of the hydroxyapatite through its adsorption. The \n\ninhibition of in vitro enamel demineralization was also demonstrated using TMP \n\nassociated to F in mouth rinse by Favretto et al (2013) .[Favretto et al., 2013].  \n\nThinking in controlling dental caries by inhibiting the demineralization \n\nprocess and  modulating oral pathogenic biofilms , it would be opportune to \n\ndevelop a composite containing TMP, F and AgNP. So, the objective of this \n\nstudy was to synthesize and characterize a nanocomposite with TMP,  F,  and  \n\nAgNP, and to verify its effect on tooth enamel demineralization as well as its \n\nantimicrobial action in single and dual species of biofilms of Candida albicans \n\nand Streptococcus mutans.  \n\n \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nSynthesis and characterization of sodium trimetaphosphate, fluoride and \n\nsilver nanoparticles  \n\nThe synthesis of the nanocomposite with sodium trimetaphosphate \n\n(TMP),  fluoride (F)  and silver nanoparticles (AgNP) was performed on an \n\nalcoholic medium (isopropanol) using sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma-\n\nAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as a reductor agent, following the protocol \n\nproposed by Miranda et al (2010). [Miranda M, 2010] with some modifications. \n\nSuspensions containing sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS \n\n7785-84 4), fluoride (NaF, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and silver nitrate \n\n(AgNO3, Merck) were prepared in the presence of surfactant (ammonium salt of \n\npolymethacrylic acid (NHPM), Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). AgNO3 \n\nwas employed at 10% of the weight of TMP. The molar proportions between \n\nTMP  and F was 1.23 : 1 respectively. The nanocomposite was stove-dried \n\novernight at 70\u00b0C in . The size and morphology of 100F/TMP/Ag (Figure 1) and \n\nTMP (Figure 2) were investigated by transmission electron microscopy using \n\nHRTEM TECNAI F 20 Microscope operating at 200 kV. The samples were \n\ndispersed in isopropanol and deposited onto a carbon coated grid. The 2-D \n\nimages were constructed by analyzing the P K? and Ag L?1 energy emissions \n\nthrough Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS).  \n\n \n\nCompounds formulation and fluoride assessment \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nThe nanocomposite previously synthetized containing 0.2% TMP, Ag at \n\n10% and 100 ppm F (100F/TMP/Ag) were diluted in deionized water. The \n\ncontrol solutions used were deionized water, 100 and 225 ppm F (as NaF, \n\nMerck, CAS 7681-49-4, Germany). A solution containing  0.2% TMP, 100 ppm \n\nF (100F/TMP) was also prepared. F concentrations [Delbem et al., 2009] of the \n\ngroups containing or not Ag were checked prior to the beginning of the study. \n\n \n\nExperimental Design for pH-cycling \n\nEnamel blocks (4 mm \u00d7 4 mm, n=60) were obtained from bovine incisors \n\nkept in formaldehyde 2% pH 7.0 for 30 days prior to experimental procedures \n\n[Delbem and Cury, 2002]. Blocks were selected by initial surface hardness test \n\n(SHi; 320 to 380 KHN) and randomly divided in five experimental solutions \n\n(n=12 each). They were submitted to a pH-cycling regimen (5 days) and to \n\ntreatments (twice a day) with the following solutions: deionized water (Placebo), \n\n100 ppm F (100F), 225 ppm F (225F), 100 ppm F plus TMP at concentration of \n\n0.2% (100F/TMP) and 100 ppm F plus TMP at concentration of 0.2% plus Ag at \n\n10% (100F/TMP/Ag),. Next, final surface harness (SHf), integrated loss \n\nsubsurface hardness (?KHN), enamel fluoride (F), calcium (Ca) concentration \n\nwere determined. \n\n \n\npH-cycling and treatment with solutions \n\nThe blocks were submittedto five pH cycles during five days (one \n\ncycle/day), and immersed in a fresh remineralizing solution for two additional \n\ndays [Vieira et al., 2005]. They were immersed under constant stirring in each \n\nspecific solution 1 mL) when removed from the demineralizing (6 hours \u2013 Ca \n\nand P 2,0 mmol L\n-1\n\n in acetate buffer 0,075 mol L\n-1\n\n, 0,04 ?g F/mL in pH 4,7 \u2013 2,2 \n\nmL/mm\n2\n) and from the remineralizing solutions (18 hours \u2013 Ca 1.5 mmol L\n\n-1\n, P \n\n0.9 mmol L\n-1\n\n, KCl 0.15 mol L\n-1\n\n in cacodylic buffer 0.02 mol L\n-1\n\n, 0. 05 ?g F/mL in \n\npH 7,0 \u2013 1,1 mL/mm\n2\n).  The blocks were washed with deionized water for 30 \n\nseconds.  \n\n \n\nAnalysis of enamel hardness  \n\nSurface hardness was determined with Micromet 5114 hardness tester \n\n(Buehler, Lake Bluff, USA) and Buehler Omni Met software (Buehler, Lake Bluff, \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nUSA) with a Knoop diamond indenter under a 25 g load for 10s. Five \n\nindentations, separated by a distance of 100 ?m, were made in the center of \n\neach block to analyze initial surface hardness (SHi). After the pH-cycling, final \n\nsurface hardness (SHf) was calculated by producing five other indentations \n\n(100 ?m from the baseline indentations). For cross-sectional hardness \n\nmeasurements, blocks were sectioned at the center and one of the halves was \n\nincluded in acrylic resin and gradually polished until the enamel was totally \n\nexposed. One sequence of 14 indentations were created at different distances \n\n(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 220, and 330 ?m) from the \n\nsurface of the enamel, in the central region of the blocks, using a Micromet \n\n5114 hardness tester (Buehler Lake Bluff, IL, USA) with a Knoop diamond \n\nindenter under a 5-g load for 10 s. Integrated hardness (KHN \u00d7 \u00b5m) for the \n\nlesion into sound enamel was calculated by the trapezoidal rule (GraphPad \n\nPrism, version 3.02) and subtracted from the integrated hardness for sound \n\nenamel to obtain the integrated area of the subsurface regions in enamel, which \n\nwas named integrated loss of subsurface hardness (?KHN; KHN \u00d7 \u00b5m) [Spiguel \n\net al., 2009]. \n\n \n\nAnalysis of F and Ca concentration in the enamel  \n\nBlocks (n=12/per group, 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm) were obtained from the halves of \n\nthe original 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm specimens not embedded, and fixed with adhesive \n\nglue on a mandrel for straight. Self-adhesive polishing discs (diameter, 13 mm) \n\nand 400-grit silicon carbide (Buehler) were fixed to the bottom of polystyrene \n\ncrystal tube (J-10; Injeplast, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil). One layer of 50.0 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5m \n\neach enamel block was removed. The vials, after the addition of 0.5 ml HCl 1.0 \n\nmol L\n-1\n\n, were kept under constant stirring for 1 hour [Weatherell et al., 1985], \n\nmodified by Alves et al. [Alves et al., 2007]. For F analysis, specific electrode \n\n9409BN (Thermo Scientific, Beverly, MA, USA) and microelectrode reference \n\n(Analyser, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) coupled to an ion analyzer (Orion 720A+, Thermo \n\nScientific, Beverly, MA, USA) was used. The electrodes were calibrated with \n\nstandards containing from 0.25 to 4.00 ?g F/mL (100 ppm F, Orion 940907), \n\nunder the same conditions as the samples. The readings were conducted using \n\n0.25 mL of the biopsy solution, buffered with the same volume of TISAB II \n\nmodified NaOH [Akabane et al., 2018]. The results were expressed in ?g/mm\n3\n. \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nCalcium (Ca) analysis was performed using the Arsenazo III colorimetric \n\nmethod [Vogel et al., 1983]. The absorbance readings were recorded at 650 nm \n\nby using a plate reader (PowerWave 340, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). The \n\nresults were expressed as mg/mm\n3\n. \n\n \n\nBiofilm formation and treatment \n\nBiofilms from single and mixed cultures were cultured in 96-well \n\nmicrotiter plates (Costar\u00ae, Corning Incorporated, Tewksbury, MA,USA). Each \n\nwell received 200 ?l of C. albicans (ATCC 10231) cell suspension (1 \u00d7 10\n7\n ml \n\n-1\n \n\ncells in artificial saliva), according to the methodology by Silva et al. [Silva et al., \n\n2010], and 200 ?l of S. mutans (ATCC 25175) cell suspension (1 \u00d7 10\n8\n ml\n\n-1\n \n\ncells in artificial saliva), following the study of Arias et al. [Arias et al., 2016], for \n\nthe formation of simple biofilms. For biofilms of mixed species, 100 ?l of each \n\nsuspension (2 \u00d7 10\n7\n ml\n\n-1\n cells of C. albicans plus 2 \u00d7 10\n\n8\n cells ml\n\n-1\n of S. mutans) \n\nwas dispensed into each well. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 2 h for \n\nbiofilm adhesion. After this time, the wells containing biofilm were washed once \n\nwith 200 ?l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7, 0.1 M) to remove non-\n\nadherent cells. Subsequently, the treatment was carried out by adding 200 ?l of \n\nartificial saliva containing 100F/TMP/Ag at 40 \u00b5g ml\n-1\n\n. For positive and negative \n\ncontrol were used 0.018% Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG; Periogard, Colgate \n\nPalmolive Industrial Ltda, Sao Paulo, Brazil) and artificial saliva. The biofilms \n\nwere then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.  \n\n \n\nBiofilm quantification \n\nThe colony-forming unit counting test (CFUs) was used to quantify the \n\nsingle and mixed biofilms of C. albicans and S. mutans. For thus, biofilm-\n\ncontaining wells were scraped  and  the suspensions were vortexed and serially \n\ndiluted in PBS and plated on SDA (C. albicans), BHI (S. mutans). For mixed \n\nbiofilm,  microorganisms were plated on CHROMagar (Difco) (C. albicans) and \n\nBHI supplemented with amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) (S. mutans) [Fernandes \n\net al., 2016]. After this, the agar plates were incubated at 37\u00ba C during 24 h for \n\nC. albicans and 48h for S. mutans. In the next step the number of CFUs was \n\ncounted and log CFU per unit area (log10 CFU cm\n-2\n\n) was determined. The tests \n\nwere performed independently and in triplicate. \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n\nMicroscopy \n\n The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) was performed to visualize \n\nchanges in the structure of the simple and mixed biofilms submitted to the \n\ntreatment with the nanocomposite. Single and mixed biofilms were formed in \n\n24-well plates as descrived above. Briefly, after cell adhesion period, the \n\nnanocomposite, positive and negative controls were added to the wells as \n\npreviously described. After 24 h, the wells were gently washed once with PBS \n\nand the biofilms were dehydrated according to the protocol of Silva et al \n\n(2013).[Silva et al., 2013]. The bottom of each well containing  the biofilms was \n\nthen cut with a flame-sterilized scalpel blade (number 11, Solidor, Lamedid \n\nComercial e Servi\u00e7os Ltda, Barueri, Brazil). After this, the samples received a \n\ngold bath and SEM analysis was performed (S-360 microscope, Leo, \n\nCambridge, MA, USA) [Fernandes et al., 2016]. \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nThe analyzes of pH-cycling were performed using SigmaPlot  software \n\n(version 12.0) (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and the level of \n\nstatistical significance was set at 5%. The variables% SH and F did not present \n\nnormal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk) and homogeneous (Cochran test) and were \n\nsubmitted to Kruskal-Wallis followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls comparison \n\ntest. The Ca values were homogeneous (log10 transformation) and were \n\nsubmitted to analysis of variance at a criterion followed by the Student-\n\nNewman-Keuls test. For the variable ?KHN, treatments and areas were \n\nconsidered as variables of variation. The results showed normal and \n\nhomogeneous distribution and were submitted to analysis of variance at two \n\ncriteria followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. For the biofilm analysis, \n\nSigmaPlot 12.0 software was also used with a significance level of 5%. The \n\nquantification of the colony forming units (CFUs) of the simple and mixed \n\nbiofilms passed the Shapiro-Wilks test of normal and homogeneous distribution \n\nand were subjected to One Way Analysis of Variance. After all the paired data \n\nwere submitted to a multiple comparison protocol by the Holm-Sidak method. \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nSynthesis and characterization the nanocomposite \n\nTEM show images of  association  between silver nanoparticles  with \n\nsodium trimetaphosphate (TMP). Figure 1 shows  silver nanoparticles anchoring \n\non the surface of the TMP, in a dispersed and uncrosslinked form.   \n\nThe Histogram of TEM image (Figure 1-B) demonstrate the mean size of the Ag \n\nnanoparticles was 11 nm. Figure 1-A shows silver nanoparticles (gray shades) \n\ndispersed and decorating the surface of the phosphates at micrometric size \n\n(white shades)(Figure 1-C). The 2D images were constructed by analyzing the \n\nenergy released from the P K? (constituents of the TMP material) (Figure 1-D) \n\nand Ag K? (Figure 1-E) emissions, indicating the uniform distribution of these \n\nelements in the demarcated area in the micrograph.  \n\nThe Histogram and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) of the \n\ncommercial TMP indicated the mean size of 72nm and the presence of sodium \n\n(Na), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) (Figure 2). \n\n \n\nAnalysis of superficial (%SH) and tranversal hardness (?KHN), F and Ca \n\nconcentrations \n\nThe mean pH of all solutions was 7.9 (SD 0.1). The mean SH of blocks \n\nwas 360.0 (SD 9.8) KHN (p = 0,533). No significant differences were observed \n\namong the groups after random allocation (p = 0.474). \n\nThe use of 225F solution resulted in a 40% decrease in %SH in \n\ncomparison with 100F (Table 1). The demineralization of the enamel surface \n\nwas the similar in samples treated with solution containing 225F, 100F/TMP and \n\n100/TMP/Ag (table 1) (p > 0.001). In addition, the capacity to reduce the lesion \n\nbody (?KHN) was higher with 110F, 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag (p &lt;\n\n0.001) in zone A (5\u201320 ?m) and similar in zone B for 225F and 100F/TMP. The \n\n100F/TMP/Ag group had greater demineralization in zone B (20\u2013130 ?m) (p &lt;\n\n0.001) (Figure 3). \n\nA dose-response pattern was observed between F concentrations in the \n\nsolutions not supplemented with TMP/Ag and enamel fluoride uptake. The \n\naddition of TMP/Ag to the solution did not influence enamel F concentration, so \n\nthat its effect was similar to 225F, except for the Placebo, 100F and 100F/TMP \n\nwhich showed a lower concentration (p &lt;0.001). The 100F, 225F, 100F/TMP \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nand 100F/TMP/Ag groups had the highest and similar Ca concentration (p > \n\n0.001), followed by Placebo. \n\n \n\nAntimicrobial effect \n\n Figure 4 shows 100F/TMP/Ag nanocomposite afforded expressive \n\nreductions of S. mutans cultivables cells of 5.42 and 4.46 log10 respectively in \n\nsingle and mixed biofilms. Indeed, those reductions were statistically similar to \n\nthe reduction promoted by chlorhexidine glucanate (PC) regardless if S. mutans \n\ngrew in the presence or not of C. albicans. Figure 4 also suggests S. mutans \n\nwas more tolerant to both 100F/TMP/Ag and PC when its biofilm was formed in \n\nthe presence of C. albicans, increasing the S. mutans cell viability from 0.70 to \n\n2.29 log10 and from 1.23 to 2.52 log10. It is also noted that C. albicans was more \n\nresistant to 100F/TMP/Ag and PC in mixed biofilms, increasing the viable cells \n\nin 0.63 and 1.14 log10 respectively. Although 100F/TMP/Ag has reduced less \n\nthan 0.5 log10 the viable cells of C. albicans in both single and mixed biofilms, \n\nthe 100F/TMP/Ag effectiveness was considered statically significant when \n\ncompared to the negative control. \n\n \n\nMicroscopy \n\nFigure 5 shows the treatment with 100F/TMP/Ag nanocomposite was \n\neffective against single and mixed biofilms of C. albicans and S. mutans, and \n\nsimilar to the reduction obtained with treatment with chlorhexidine glucanate \n\n(positive control). \n\n \n\n \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThe present study showed that the nanocomposite synthesized  \n\ndemonstrated an anticarie and antimicrobial potential. \n\nThe ability of inhibition of demineralization was determined by an in vitro \n\nmodel that simulates the caries dynamics through pH cycling [Vieira et al., \n\n2005]. The concentration of TMP and F chosen was based on previous studies \n\n[Favretto et al., 2013; Manarelli et al., 2011] where mouth rinse containing \n\n100ppmF associated with 0.2% TMP also obtained similar results to the mouth \n\nrinse containing 225 ppm of F against artificial caries lesions [Favretto et al., \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n2013]. Even featuring no significant difference concentrations of fluoride in the \n\nenamel as well as in the present study compared to 100 ppm F group, the \n\nsurface and cross-sectional hardness were similar to 225 ppm F group. The \n\nassociation of TMP to 100 ppm F has shown that TMP does not further the \n\nuptake fluoride in the hydroxyapatite [Souza et al., 2013]. Nevertheless it was \n\nobserved an exponential reduction of the loss of Ca when immersed in acid \n\nsolution [Amaral et al., 2018; Souza et al., 2013]. The effect of TMP can be \n\nrelated to its capacity to hinder acid diffusion into the enamel [Akabane et al., \n\n2018; Moretto et al., 2013; Takeshita et al., 2011]  due to two possible reasons. \n\nFirst, the formulation with 100 ppm F only reduced the mineral loss in relation to \n\nplacebo with no significance difference of F, and lower Ca, present in the \n\nenamel when compared to 100F/0.2% TMP group (Table 1). Second, TMP \n\ndoes not enhance the deposition of calcium fluoride [Souza et al., 2013], but \n\nassociated to 100 ppm F increased the protective effect against enamel erosion \n\n[Manarelli et al., 2011]. TMP is adsorbed making a layer on enamel [Akabane et \n\nal., 2018; Amaral et al., 2018] that alters the selective permeability and diffusion \n\nof ions into the inner enamel [Akabane et al., 2018; Takeshita et al., 2011]. This \n\ncan explain the lower mineral loss in the deeper of the enamel (Zone B: Table 1 \n\nand Figure 1) and concentration of Ca (Table 1) in the enamel like the 225 ppm \n\nF. \n\nThe addition of the silver nanoparticles (AgNP) to  the nanocomposite \n\nwas aimed to add  antimicrobial action to TMP-F proportion proven effective \n\nagainst enamel demineralization. The concentration of AgNP was based on   \n\nMendes-Gouv\u00eaa et al (2018) [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018] In the present \n\nstudy, it was found that the addition of silver nanoparticles did not affect the \n\ndemineralization inhibition property of the enamel surface when associated to \n\nTMP/F, since %SH and ?KHN at zone A (5 \u2013 20 \u00b5m; Table 1 and Figure 1) \n\npresented similar values compared to a conventional 225 ppm F solution. The \n\nsame occurred in relation to the amount of F and Ca at ~50 ?m of depth from \n\nthe surface of the enamel (table 1) for 100F/TMP/Ag solution, which obtained \n\nvalues were close to the solution of 225 ppm F. The best effect of the group 225 \n\nppm F compared to 100 ppm F was dependent of the F uptake in the enamel. In \n\nthe case of 100F/0.2% TMP, it was dependent on the ability of TMP to reduce \n\nthe acid diffusion into the enamel. However, it appears that the product \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\ndeposited from the nanocomposite on the outer layer of the enamel does not \n\navoid deep mineral loss in the enamel. Probably, the product formed with Ag \n\nmay have a restricted effect on the outermost layer of the enamel and, when \n\nassociated with TMP, may affect its adsorption on the enamel.  \n\nAlthough there are no studies showing the association of Ag, TMP and F, \n\nother studies have already tested the action of the Ag with F in the enamel \n\ndemineralization and remineralization [Delbem et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012; \n\nNozari et al., 2017; Punyanirun et al., 2018; Zhi et al., 2013]. These studies \n\nagree that mechanism of action of Ag/F is due to deposition of calcium fluoride \n\nand silver phosphate on enamel. This coating formed on enamel from of the Ag \n\nand F would work as a source of F and PO4 inducing the precipitation of \n\nfluorapatite and producing superior enamel remineralization [Punyanirun et al., \n\n2018; Zhi et al., 2013]. Nevertheless, the majority of studies do not show an \n\nadditional effect of Ag when associated with F [Delbem et al., 2006; Liu et al., \n\n2012; Zhi et al., 2013], mainly in the deeper region of the enamel. The studies \n\nthat show an adjunct effect of Ag analyzed the enamel by micro-computed \n\ntomography [Punyanirun et al., 2018] or only determined the surface hardness \n\n[Nozari et al., 2017]. Indeed, the Ag ions which penetrated into the enamel [Liu \n\net al., 2012; Nozari et al., 2017; Zhi et al., 2013] may be responsible by the \n\nincrease in mineral density in depth of the lesions not signifying true \n\nremineralization [Liu et al., 2012; Zhi et al., 2013]. It seems that the deposits of \n\nAg and F formed would produce a great mineralization in the outer of the \n\nenamel as observer in the present study (zone A: 5 \u2013 20 \u00b5m; Table 1 and \n\nFigure1). \n\nNevertheless, these layers do not hinder acid diffusion into the enamel \n\nand the mineral loss in the inner of the enamel (zone B: 20 \u2013 130 \u00b5m). It is \n\nimportant to say that the studies cited above used Ag in its ionic form at 38% \n\nand the present study tested nanocomposites with silver nanoparticles at 10%. \n\nThus, the products formed on enamel from the nanocomposite may contain \n\ndifferences that influenced the results. Of the three groups with similarity in the \n\n%SH results (Table 1) showed no difference in the concentration of calcium in \n\nthe enamel. However, the higher presence of fluoride in the enamel was \n\nobserved for formulation with more F (225 ppm F) or with AgNP added \n\n(100/TMP/Ag). Despite this, the greater mineral loss with the nanocomposite in \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\ndepth in the enamel can be explained by two probable reasons. First, the \n\npresence of AgNP in the TMP/F formulation may have reduced the TMP \n\nadsorption on the enamel. TMP is able to hinder acid penetration into the \n\nenamel as described above. Second, the layer formed by products from AgNP \n\nand F did not block acid diffusion since the mineral loss in the deeper of the \n\nlesion occurred. However, nanocomposite should be tested in in situ and in vivo \n\nstudies since it presented the antimicrobial effect and the mineral loss may be \n\nlower than observed in the pH-cycling model. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that one of the limitations of in vitro pH cycling \n\nmodels is that it can not represent with fidelity the complex reactions that occur \n\nin the oral environment. In this study, we sought to correlate the effect of \n\nenamel demineralization reduction with the ability to inhibit the formation of \n\nbiofilms by microorganisms responsible for acid secretion that results in caries \n\nlesion. Thus, we tested this compound against simple and mixed biofilms of the \n\nbacterial specie Streptococcus mutans and the fungal specie Candida albicans. \n\nThe association of sodium trimethaphosphate (TMP), fluoride (F) and \n\nAgNPs was able to produce a nanocomposite with antimicrobial action against \n\nthe formation of biofilms of two important oral pathogens Candida albicans and \n\nStreptococcus mutans, regardless if it were in single or dual species forms. The \n\nresults of our previous study  [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018] demonstrated the \n\nassociation of TMP-Ag did not reduce the inhibition potential of AgNP against C. \n\nalbicans and S. mutans. Conversely, the highest effectiveness was displayed \n\nwhen AgNP were in TMP in particular against S. mutans. It is noteworthy that \n\n100F/TMP/Ag was also expressively effective to prevent the biofilm growth of S. \n\nmutans, reducing more than 99.999% the bioflm formation of this Gram positive \n\nbacteria. This highest inhibitory biofilm growth could be ascribed to alteration of \n\nthe surface of AgNP when associated with TMP, producing more imperfections \n\non there and the increase of the AgNP reactivity which leads on disruption of \n\nsome molecules, and hence enabling the \u201emembranolytic effect? when in contact \n\nwith microorganisms cells [Richter et al., 2017]. It is also known that AgNP may \n\nadhere to the microorganism outer membrane [Li et al., 2008] or the Ag\n+\n \n\nreleased could break the membrane [M., 2013], leading to intracellular damages \n\nand death of the cell. The concentration of Ag in 100F/TMP/Ag was the same \n\nused in our previous work [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018] of 40 \u00b5g/mL and could \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nbe able to reduce 4.2 log10 24h old- biofilm cells of S. mutans. The difference \n\nbetween the results in inhibiting the biofilm growth of S. mutans and C. albicans \n\nmay either credited by the increase of the permeability of the external \n\nmembrane of S. mutans by 100F/TMP/Ag due to the sequestration of divalent \n\ncations by TMP [Akhtar et al., 2008; Maier et al., 1999; Mendes-Gouvea et al., \n\n2018; Obritsch et al., 2008] that would permit the passage of Ag into the \n\nmembranes and so damage to the bacterial cell by DNA replication loss and \n\ninactivation of some proteins [Feng et al., 2000; Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018]. \n\nFurther one, the higher efficacy of 100F/TMP combinated with AgNP against S. \n\nmutans might be due to the buffer effect promoted by that polyphosphate, \n\nincreasing the pH of the acidic environment of S mutans biofilm and so \n\ninterfering on its development [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018]. \n\nAlthough AgNP with no F/TMP had not been compared with \n\n100F/TMP/Ag, our previous study could demonstrate TMP increased the action \n\nof AgNP against single 24h old-biofilms of both microorganisms C. albicans \n\n(ATCC 10231) and S. mutans (ATCC 25175). Again, S. mutans cells were more \n\nsusceptible to TMP-AgNP nanocomposite than cells of C. albicans, and it could \n\nbe explained by the change of the AgNP crystallographic surface structures \n\nwhen it is in combination with TMP [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018; Pal et al., \n\n2007]. The TEM images elucidate how AgNP are arranged in the compound. \n\nThey are anchored in a dispersive way on the TMP surface, and it could confirm \n\nthe modification on the crystallography physical-chemical property of AgNP.  \n\nIn spite of the preliminary anti-biofilm formation experiment performed in \n\nthis study, of note should be the antibacterial potential demonstrated by \n\n100F/TMP/Ag especially considering the low concentration of Ag  and the \n\nrelevance role of S. mutans in the dental caries process. Likewise, since both \n\npathogens S. mutans and C. albicans present virulence factors on progressive \n\ncaries, it is of relevance to control their presence in the oral cavity. The \n\nnanocomposite produced in the present study aggregate the properties of TMP \n\nand F in reducing the demineralization process on enamel surface as well as \n\nthe antimicrobial action of Ag. Further studies with in situ and in vivo \n\napproaches are strongly encouraged in the sense of confirming the therapeutic \n\npotential of TMP and other polyphosphates/F associated with AgNP in \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\npreventing the most prevalent chronic oral disease in whole world, which is the \n\ndental caries. \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAkabane S, Delbem AC, Pessan J, Garcia L, Emerenciano N, Goncalves DF, Danelon M: In situ \neffect of the combination of fluoridated toothpaste and fluoridated gel containing \nsodium trimetaphosphate on enamel demineralization.

For example, if you had four rank sums sorted in order, and \n\nfound no significant difference between rank sums  4 vs. 2, then you would not test 4 vs. 3 and 3 vs. 2, \n\nbut still test 4 vs. 1 and 3 vs. 1 (4 vs. 3 and 3 vs. 2 are enclosed by 4 vs. 2: 4 3 2 1).  Note that not testing \n\nthe enclosed rank sums is a procedural rule, and a result of Do Not Test should be treated as if there is no \n\nsignificant difference between the rank sums, even though one may appear to exist."}]}}}
