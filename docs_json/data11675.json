In this study, measurements of electrical conductivity were \n\naccomplished with Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and EM38 to develop the multiple \n\ndatasets for defining spatiotemporal moisture content changes and also estimating the hydraulic \n\nproperties of unsaturated soil under natural conditions and water injection test in two different \n\nsites.  \n\nThe First study was conducted at the campus of University of Lisbon in a location where had a \n\nloam soil, low permeability and high water retention capacity and the second site was a sandy \n\nsoil with high permeability and low water retention capacity located in the east of Lisbon. \n\nAppropriate relationships were derived based on the determination of the experimental curve ? \n\nvs. S by in-situ investigation to convert the electrical conductivity maps inferred from ERT and \n\nEm38 data to moisture content distribution images. In addition, the subsurface temperature \n\nvariations during the experiment was measured and the effect of temperature variations over \n\nERT images were removed by assuming 2% change in electrical resistivity per\u00b0C change in \n\ntemperature. \n\nTo estimate the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soil, flow simulations were firstly developed \n\nbased on Richards\u2019 equation and the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions of van \n\nGenuchten parametric models. Afterward, Uncoupled and coupled hydrogeophysical approaches \n\nwere used in order to constrain the van Genuchten parameters.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\niii \n \n\nResumo \n\n \n\nA condutividade el\u00e9ctrica tem sido frequentemente usada na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades e de \n\npar\u00e2metros hidr\u00e1ulicos do solo. Neste estudo, foram realizadas medi\u00e7\u00f5es de condutividade \n\nel\u00e9ctrica usando a tomografia el\u00e9ctrica (ERT) e o instrumento EM38, para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma \n\nbase de dados a utilizar na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das varia\u00e7\u00f5es espacial e temporal das propriedades \n\nhidr\u00e1ulicas da camada n\u00e3o saturada do solo, em condi\u00e7\u00f5es naturais e sujeito a um teste de \n\ninjec\u00e7\u00e3o. Os estudos foram realizados em dois locais distintos. \n\n \n\nO primeiro estudo foi realizado no Campus da Universidade de Lisboa, num terreno argiloso, \n\ncom baixa permeabilidade e com uma elevada capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua. O segundo \n\nestudo foi realizado num local com um solo arenoso, com permeabilidade elevada e fraca \n\ncapacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, localizado a leste de Lisboa. A partir dos modelos calculados \n\ndos dados de ERT e EM38, e de resultados laboratoriais de amostras colhidas nos locais, foram \n\nobtidas rela\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais entre a resistividade e o conte\u00fado de \u00e1gua no solo. Estas rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nforam posteriormente usadas para a convers\u00e3o dos modelos ERT e EM38 em mapas de conte\u00fado \n\nde \u00e1gua. A temperatura em profundidade foi tamb\u00e9m medida durante a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos perfis. \n\nEstes valores foram usados para corrigir os dados de ERT, assumindo uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o de 2% no \n\nvalor da resistividade pela varia\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura, de 1\u00ba Celsius. \n\n \n\nForam realizadas simula\u00e7\u00f5es de fluxo de \u00e1gua, baseadas na equa\u00e7\u00e3o de Richard, considerando os \n\npar\u00e2metros de van Genuchten para a representa\u00e7\u00e3o da reten\u00e7\u00e3o de condutividade hidr\u00e1ulica do \n\nsolo, com  o objectivo de obter estimativas das propriedades hidr\u00e1ulicas da camada n\u00e3o saturada \n\ndo solo. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\niv \n \n\nKeywords \n\n \n\nERT \n\nEM38 \n\nUnsaturated zone \n\n1D Coupled Hydrogeoelectrical Model \n\nMoisture Content Estimation \n\nHydraulic Conductivity Estimation \n\nVan Genuchten Parameters Estimation \n\nWater Injection Test \n\nSpatial Moment Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nv \n \n\nAbbreviations \n\n \n\nERT- Electrical Resistivity Tomography \n\nECa- Apparent Electrical Conductivity  \n\nGPR- Ground-Penetrating Radar  \n\nEM- Electromagnetic Methods  \n\nLHS - Latin Hypercube Sampling \n\nRMS - Root Mean Square \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n \n\nUndertaking the PhD program at University of Lisbon in the past four years was a truly \n\nexceptional experience in my life.  \n\nFirst of all I would like to acknowledge the expert guidance I received from my supervisor, Prof. \n\nFernando Santos.

Introduction \n\n \n\nThe importance of soil characterization in the top 1-2 meters is widely recognized as a key \n\nparameter in agriculture and is critical in determining crop productivity through its impact on \n\ngermination and growth of the plants. Development of the means to monitor soil moisture \n\nspatiotemporally in agricultural fields is very important for effective soil moisture management. \n\nMoreover, hydraulic conductivity is an important soil property when determining the potential \n\nfor water movement in topsoil and in spite of its importance; soil hydraulic conductivity remains \n\none of the most difficult of soil properties to assess and laboratory methods have limitations due \n\nto the size of the samples and usually in-situ methods are required to estimate hydraulic \n\nconductivity. Recent researches have shown that geophysical surveys using non-invasive and \n\ncost-effective methods are a viable alternative to direct and invasive measurements techniques \n\nfor hydrologic characterization. Direct methods are based on drilling and cause major \n\ndisturbance to the natural conditions. In addition, direct measurements by sample collection \n\ncannot be repeated over time on the same place, while hydrologic characterization of topsoil \n\nrequires a repetition of data collection from a specified field site. Moreover, direct measurements \n\ndo not usually cover a large area allowing only localized investigation which might cause \n\nuncertainty in hydrologic characterization of unsaturated zone. Geophysical methods, \n\nparticularly ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) (e.g. \n\nBinley et al., 2001, 2002a, 2002b; Cassiani et al., 2004; Binley and Kemna, 2005; Looms et al. \n\n2008a, 2008b) and also Electromagnetic methods (EM) (e.g. McNeill 1986; Williams and Hoey, \n\n1987; Kachanoski et al. 1988; Brevik and Fenton, 2002; Hezarjaribi and Sourell, 2007; \n\nTriantafilis and Santos, 2009, 2010) have been widely used to investigate the unsaturated zone.  \n\nSoil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by ERT and EM methods is a surrogate \n\nmeasure for soil properties and can be correlated with soil properties such as cation exchange \n\ncapacity (e.g. Triantafilis et al. 2009), depth to bedrock and soil texture (e.g. Zhu et al., 2010), \n\nclay content and salinity (e.g. Corwin and Lesch, 2005) or moisture content (e.g. Binley et al., \n\n2001)  by empirical or semiempirical relationships (e.g. Archie, 1942) or established in-situ \n\nrelationships (e.g. Binley et al., 2002a). Consequently, resistivity changes interpretation might be \n\ncomplicated unless variation in resistivity is dominated by one of these parameters.  \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nTime-lapse geophysical monitoring is also a powerful tool to estimate those hydrologic variables \n\nthat are time dependent such as water movement or hydraulic conductivity (e.g. Deiana et al., \n\n2007). The major aim of time-lapse monitoring is to identify changes in resistivity at selected \n\nlocations at different times accurately. This method is widely used to track tracer migration (e.g. \n\nDaily et al., 1992; Kemna et al., 2002; Slater and Sandberg, 2000, Singha and Gorelick, 2006; \n\nVanderborght et al., 2005) monitor infiltration (e.g. Barker and Moore, 1998; Binley et al., \n\n2002a; French and Binley, 2004; Dienna et al. 2007; Looms et al. 2008a, 2008b), underground \n\nsteam injection (Ramirez et al., 1993); trichloroethylene remediation (Daily and Ramirez, 1995) \n\nand environmental studies to monitor the remediation and migration of contaminants (Hayley et \n\nal., 2009; LaBrecque et al., 1996a; Shima et al., 1996).  \n\nSelecting appropriate method and devise and designing a suitable configuration depends on \n\nseveral factors such as the depth of investigation, required accuracy and the site specification. \n\nMany researchers (e.g. van Overmeeren et al., 1997; Huisman et al., 2001, 2002; Cassiani et al., \n\n2006) could successfully monitor the unsaturated zone by ground surface geophysical \n\nmeasurements where the depth of investigation was not deeper than a few meters below ground. \n\nAs pointed out by Binley and Kemna, (2005) and discussed in Dienna et al. (2007), ground \n\nsurface geophysical measurements is easier to achieve rather than borehole geophysical \n\nmeasurements which requires purpose-drilled boreholes and good contact between electrodes \n\nand formations and also requires less sophisticated data acquisition. Processing techniques are \n\nusually less time consuming and complex; however, ground surface geophysical measurements \n\nis rarely applied to the study of vadose-zone processes deeper than a few meters because of the \n\nlimited sensitivity at depth.  \n\nIn this study, measurements of ECa was accomplished by ground surface ERT and multi-height \n\nEM38 under natural condition and forced infiltration experiment to provide an insight into \n\nspatiotemporal soil moisture distribution and estimate hydrological parameters particularly \n\nhydraulic conductivity in unsaturated soil. We also investigated the EM38 quality and precision \n\nin monitoring ECa changes in comparison with ERT images.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n1.2. Thesis aim and objectives \n\nThe main aim of this thesis is to explore the potential of ERT and EM38 for soil moisture \n\ndetermination and hydraulic conductivity estimation in unsaturated zone.  To achieve the main \n\naim, the key thesis objectives were to: \n\n1. Two filed sites with different soil texture were selected to conduct geophysical \n\nmeasurements in topsoil. The first field site is a loam soil with low permeability and high \n\nwater retention capacity while the second study was conducted in a deep Arenosol soil \n\nwith high permeability and a low water retention capacity. \n\n \n\n2. A capacitance sensor was used to monitor moisture content variations during the \n\nexperiment in order to control the geophysical approach. \n\n \n3. Studies of moisture content soil distribution in topsoil and water movement under forced-\n\ninfiltration experiment were conducted using time-lapse ground surface ERT and multi \n\nheight EM38. \n\n \n\n4. In-situ relationships were derived based on the determination of the ECa and moisture \n\ncontent to convert the ECa changes to moisture content changes. \n\n \n5. The subsurface temperature variations during the water\u2013injection test were measured by \n\nusing suitably placed sensors and the effect of the temperature variations over ERT \n\nimages was removed. \n\n \n6. Unsaturated flow model were simulated in order to estimate the hydraulic conductivity \n\nand constrain the hydrological model through a comparison of flow simulations with \n\ntime-lapse geophysical images. \n\n \n7. The mass loss, centre-of-mass vertical motion and vertical spread of geophysical images \n\nwere evaluated using moment analysis. \n\n \n8. A 1D coupled geoelectric-infiltration model was developed in order to estimate hydraulic \n\nconductivity.  \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n1.3.Thesis organization \n\n \n\nThis thesis is divided into seven chapters: \n\nChapter One: provides a brief overview on geophysical application in unsaturated soil \n\ncharacterization and a description of the primary aim and objectives of the thesis. \n\nChapter Two: describes the study area including location, climate and soil information. \n\nChapter Three: describe and discuss ERT and electromagnetic (EM38) theory, equipments and \n\nforward and inversion process briefly.

Materials and Methods \n\nStudies of water movement in the unsaturated sandstone were conducted using ground surface \n\nERT and EM methods. We discuss the following aspects: 1) ERT and EM methods in \n\nmonitoring of unsaturated zone, 2) inversion process, 3) unsaturated flow simulation, 4) moment \n\nanalysis, 5) soil test methods, 6) field sensors for soil moisture measurement and 7) temperature \n\ninfluence in ERT and EM data. \n\n \n\n3.1.  EM methods \nEM sensors typically integrate the below-ground response to interrogate electromagnetic fields, \n\nand if the depth response function of the probe is known, the potential exists to invert the \n\nintegrated response to give a depth profile of the driving soil attribute (for example electrical \n\nconductivity). The EM technique was initially introduced for measuring and mapping soil \n\nsalinity (Halvorson and Rhoades, 1974; McNeill, 1986; Wollenhaupt et al., 1986) and was \n\nextended to quantifying and mapping soil moisture content. The relationship between soil \n\nmoisture content and ECa has been established by many investigators (e.g. Sheets and \n\nHendrickx, 1995; Hanson and Kaita, 1997; Reedy and Scanlon, 2003; Brevik et al., 2006; \n\nHezarjaribi and Sourell, 2007). Hossain, (2008) presented a comprehensive review of EM \n\nsensors in water content estimation. Different methods were used to calibrate the EM sensors \n\nagainst water content. For instance Kachanoski et al. (1988) developed the relationship between \n\nECa and moisture content, in a non-saline soil with low concentrations of dissolved electrolytes \n\nand found that the ECa explained 96% of the spatial variation in the soil moisture (surface to 0.5 \n\nm depth) in a 1.8-ha study area. However, they did not find any significant relationship between \n\nECa and moisture content at depths below 0.5 m. Hanson and Kaita, (1997) conducted an \n\nexperiment to observe the response of moisture content in soils of three salinity levels. The R2 \n\nvalues for the horizontal dipole orientation were 0.81, 0.89, 0.92 for low, medium and high \n\nsalinity level, respectively, and for the vertical dipole orientation were 0.76, 0.94 and 0.95. The \n\nEM38 was calibrated against neutron probe-based estimates of moisture content. Sherlock and \n\nMcDonnell, (2003) found a good relationship (R2 = 0.70) between ECa and gravimetrically \n\ndetermined moisture content from soil samples taken at a depth of 0.2 m. The same relationship \n\nwas observed by Brevik et al., (2006).  \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n3.1.1.The EM38 \n\nThe EM38 is a widely-used electromagnetic instrument for soil characterization developed by \n\nGeonics Ltd. (Ontario, Canada). It comprises two electrical coils, one a transmitter (Tx) and the \n\nother a receiver (Rx), placed 1 meter apart in a wooden frame (Fig.3.1). The transmitter coil is \n\nexcited with a sinusoidal current at a frequency of 14.6 kHz that creates a time-varying \n\nmagnetic field in the vicinity of the coil and when activated, the time-varying magnetic field \n\ninduces eddy currents in the soil. The magnitude of the eddy currents is proportional to the \n\nelectrical conductivity of the soil in that layer of the soil (Fig.3.2). Each current loop generates a \n\nsecondary magnetic field proportional to the value of the current flowing within the loop. A \n\nfraction of the secondary magnetic field from each loop is intercepted by the receiver coil of the \n\ninstrument; the sum of these signals is amplified and formed into an output voltage. The process \n\nof electromagnetic induction results in a secondary magnetic field which is 90\u00ba out of phase \n\nwith the primary field. The sensor coil is designed to measure this out-of-phase component, \n\nhence the notion of quadrature (Hossain, 2008). At low induction numbers, the apparent \n\nconductivity ?  in the vicinity of the transmitter coil is determined by the ratio of the \n\nmagnitudes of the out-of-phase secondary to primary magnetic fields using the following \n\nequation (McNeill, 1980): \n\n \n\n?\n?? ?                                                                                                                        (3.1) \n\nwhere   is the ratio of the out-of-phase secondary to primary magnetic fields, \n(Subscript \u2018Q\u2019 denotes quadrature, that is, 90\u00b0 out of phase) \n\n? = apparent electrical conductivity \n\n ?= 2?f (f = frequency in Hz) \n\n? = permeability of free space = 4? *  kg m/s2.A2 \n\ns = distance between transmitter and sensing coils or inter-coil spacing and is equal to 1 m in \n\nEM38 \n\nA = area of the (transmitter) coil \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \nFigure.3.1.

Schematic diagram of the Geonics EM38 unit showing locations of transmitter and receiver coils, the \n\nspatial structure of the primary magnetic field during the peak current phase within the transmitter coil and that of \n\nthe secondary magnetic fields generated in response eddy currents generated in the conductive medium. In this \n\nvertical dipole mode of operation, the primary field lines shown (HP) have cylindrical symmetry around the vertical \n\naxis (Lamb et al. 2005) \n\n \n\nIn cylindrical coordinates, the axial and radial components of the primary magnetic field in the \n\nvicinity of a magnetic dipole are given respectively by (Wait, 1982): \n\n \n\n?\n\n    /    /                                                                                     (3.2) \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n?    /                                                                                                          (3.3) \n \n\nwhere,  is the axial component of the magnetic field  \n\n is the radial component of the magnetic field \n\nz is the axial distance, along the axis of the field symmetry, from the coil \n\nr is the radial distance, perpendicular to the axis of field symmetry, from the coil \n\nA is the area of the (transmitter) coil \n\nThe approximation in (Equation 3.1) holds for both horizontal as well as vertical dipole modes \n\n(McNeill, 1980).  \n\nA key assumption in understanding the nature of the integrated response of the surface \n\nmeasurement of EM instruments like the EM38 is that individual, below ground \u2018current loops\u2019 \n\nare not influenced by others nearby (McNeill, 1980). Consequently, the net secondary magnetic \n\nfield at the receiver is the sum of the independent secondary magnetic fields from each of the \n\nindividual current loops. This gives rise to the notional depth-response of the EM sensor \n\naccording to the relative contributions of secondary magnetic fields arising from different depths \n\ndirectly below the sensor. For vertical and horizontal dipole configurations (McNeill, 1980), \n\nthese contributions are given respectively as: \n\n \n\n?   /                                                                                                                   (3.4) \n?   /                                                                                                            (3.5)  \n \n\nHere z is the ratio of axial distance below the sensor, and s is inter-coil spacing (1 m). Both of \n\nthese expressions, shown graphically in Figure 3.3(a), are developed from the notion that the \n\nsensor is placed, regardless of vertical or horizontal dipole mode of operation, on the surface of a \n\nconductive half-layer, whereby there is no conductive medium above the surface (z > 0) and a \n\nconductive medium below the surface (z &lt;0) (Hossain, 2008). The exact amplitude and phase of \n\nthe secondary field will differ from those of the primary field as a result of soil properties (e.g. \n\nclay content, moisture content and salinity), spacing of the coils and their orientation, frequency, \n\nand distance from the soil surface (Hendrickx et al., 2002). Although Equations 3.4 and 3.5 \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nimply no limit to the penetration depth of EM38, the \u2018effective\u2019 measurement depth of operation \n\nis accepted as 1.5 m and 0.75 m as 70% of the integrated response generated from those depths \n\nfor vertical and horizontal dipole operations respectively (McNeill, 1980). Rhoades and Corwin, \n\n(1981), on the other hand report that the EM38 is primarily responsive to a depth of 1.2 m \n\ncompared to other depths. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, the effective measurement depths \n\nof EM38 is accepted as being appropriate to agriculture as the depths represent the root zone area \n\n(Corwin and Lesch, 2005). \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Cumulative response of a multilayered earth \nThe secondary magnetic field measured at the receiver is the sum of the independent magnetic \n\nfields from each individual induced current loop. The relative contribution to the secondary \n\nmagnetic field, measured at the receiver, due to the homogeneous material within a thin \n\nhorizontal layer at a depth z was estimated in Equation 3.4 and 3.5 and shown in Fig.3.3a. Then \n\nthe relative contribution to the secondary magnetic field from all material below a depth z can be \n\nexpressed by the cumulative function RH,V (for horizontal or vertical coplanar transmitter\u2013\n\nreceiver dipole configurations) as defined by McNeill, (1980): \n\n \n\n?\n?\n\n                                                                                                                  (3.6) \n\n \n\nTaking into account these definitions, the response of an M-layer earth is calculated adding the \n\ncontribution from each layer independently, weighted accordingly to its conductivity and depth \n\nas: \n\n \n\n? ? ? ?

The expressions for the functions \n\nR(Z) are (McNeill, 1980): \n\n \n\n  /                                                                                                                      (3.8) \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n                                                                                                      (3.9) \n\n  \n\nwhere Z is the depth z divided by intercoil spacing s. The use of the cumulative function in \n\nlayered-earth models is mainly determined by the low induction number condition that, in a \n\nhomogeneous half-space, happens when the ratio of the transmitter\u2013receiver separation to the \n\nskin depth is much lesser than 1(McNeill, 1980). \n\n \n\na)                                                                          b)  \n\n \nFigure 3.3 a) Relative responses of EM38 to the secondary magnetic field in a homogenous profile at different \n\ndepths for the vertical (\u2014) and horizontal (---) dipole configurations. b) Cumulative responses versus depth for \n\nvertical (\u2014) and horizontal (---) dipole configurations from all material below depth (z).

Relevant aspects of this algorithm application will be given here (See \n\nSasaki (1989) for full description of this algorithm). The earth model used in the inversion \n\nprocess consists of a number of blocks whose distribution and size depend on the locations and \n\nnumber of intercoil spacing used in data acquisition. A forward modeling subroutine, based on \n\nthe cumulative response explained in 3.1.2 is used to calculate the apparent conductivity \n\nresponse of the model. The optimization equations are represented as follows (Sasaki, 1989): \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n? ? ?                                                                                           (3.10) \n\n \n\nwhere ?p is the vector containing the corrections applicable to the parameters (block \n\nconductivities, ?j) of an initial model, ?d is the vector of the differences between calculated and \n\nobserved apparent conductivity (y). J is the Jacobian matrix whose elements are given by:  \n\n \n \n\n?                                                                                                                                      (3.11) \n \n\nThe diagonal matrix W describes the accuracy of the measured data and includes the reciprocals \n\nof the data variances. The superscript T denotes the transpose operation. The quantity ? is a \n\nLagrange multiplier (damping factor, sensu stricto) that controls the amplitude of the parameter \n\ncorrections and whose best value is empirically determined. The elements of the matrix C are the \n\ncoefficients of the values of the roughness in each parameter, which is defined in terms of the \n\nfour neighbors (north, south, east and west), as: \n\n \n\n? ? ? ? ? ?                                                                                     (3.12) \n\n \n\nthat is, the elements of C are -4, 1 or 0. An iterative process allows obtaining the final model, \n\nwith its response fitting the data set in a least square sense. The misfit between data and model \n\nresponse is given by: \n\n \n?  ?                                                                                                                           (3.13) \n\n \n\nwhere N represents the number of data points (Santos, 2004). \n\n \n\n3.2. ERT \n\n3.2.1. Basic resistivity theory \n\nERT is the method for calculation of the subsurface resistivity distribution from multiple \n\nelectrical resistance measurements made using a quadrapole arrangement of electrodes (Fig.3.4). \n\nThe electrodes are placed either on the ground surface or in the borehole and a 2-D or 3-D image \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nof the resistivity can be achieved by varying the location and spacing of the electrodes. The \n\nfundamental physical law used in resistivity surveys is Ohm\u2019s Law that governs the flow of \n\ncurrent in the ground. Different quadrapole arrangements of electrodes are used in order to \n\nimages resistivity distribution.  In practically all surveys, the potential difference between two \n\npoints (normally on the ground surface) is measured (Fig.3.4). The potential difference is then \n\ngiven by: \n\n?                                                                                                                                  (3.14) \n\n?                                                                                                                            (3.15) \nK is a geometric factor that depends on the arrangement of the four electrodes. The calculated \n\nresistivity value is an apparent resistivity value that is the resistivity of a homogeneous ground \n\nthat will give the same resistance value for the same electrode arrangement. The relationship \n\nbetween the apparent resistivity and the true resistivity is a complex relationship and need to be \n\nachieved using inversion theory (will be briefly discussed 3.2.4) to determine the true subsurface \n\nresistivity from the apparent resistivity. Figure 3.5 shows the most common arrays used in \n\nresistivity surveys together with their geometric factors. In our study, we performed 2-D imaging \n\nsurveys using Wenner, Schlumberger and dipole-dipole arrays. Among the characteristics of an \n\narray usually the depth of investigation, the sensitivity of the array to vertical and horizontal \n\nchanges in the subsurface resistivity and the signal strength are the most important to consider. \n\nLoke (2001) presented a comprehensive study of different arrays weaknesses and strengths. The \n\nWenner array is relatively sensitive to vertical changes in the subsurface resistivity below the \n\ncenter of the array. However, it is less sensitive to horizontal changes in the subsurface \n\nresistivity. In general, the Wenner array is good in resolving vertical changes (i.e. horizontal \n\nstructures), but relatively poor in detecting horizontal changes (i.e. narrow vertical structures). \n\nThe Wenner array has a moderate depth of investigation. The signal strength is inversely \n\nproportional to the geometric factor used to calculate the apparent resistivity value for the array. \n\nAmong the common arrays, the Wenner array has the strongest signal strength. This can be an \n\nimportant factor if the survey is carried in areas with high background noise. In contrast, the \n\ndipole-dipole array is very sensitive to horizontal changes in resistivity, but relatively insensitive \n\nto vertical changes in the resistivity. That means that it is good in mapping vertical structures, \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nsuch as dykes and cavities, but relatively poor in mapping horizontal structures such as sills or \n\nsedimentary layers and also this array has the very small signal strength for large values of the \n\n\u201cn\u201d factor. The voltage is inversely proportional to the cube of the \u201cn\u201d factor. The Schlumberger \n\narray is moderately sensitive to both horizontal and vertical structures. In areas where both types \n\nof geological structures are expected, this array might be a good compromise between the \n\nWenner and the dipole-dipole array.  \n\n   \n\n \n\nFig.3.4.

(3.18) \n\nwhere H(?) is raised kernel function. \n\nThe ERT surveys were carried out using Schlumberger electrode configuration in forced-\n\ninfiltration experiment for development of 1D coupled geoelectric-infiltration and therefore, \n\nnumerical solution for this array will be discussed here briefly which will be used in chapter 6. \n\nFor Schlumberger electrode configuration using Equation (3.16) we have: \n\n?\n?\n\n? ? ? ?                                                                                                      (3.19) \n\nwhere s is half the current electrode spacing. \n\nAn explicit expression for the resistivity transform can be obtained by applying Hankel's \n\ninversion (see Watson, 1966) of the Fourier-Bessel integral to the expression of the apparent \n\nresistivity in the Schlumberger arrangement given by: \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ? ?

(3.21) \n\nSubstituting (3.21) in (3.20) we have: \n\n? ?\n?\n?                                                                                               (3.22) \n\nThis is a convolution integral relating the input ?  to the output T(y). In the frequency domain \n\nthe input-output relationship given by (3.22) takes the simple algebraic form since that the ?  and \n\nT functions belong to a linear system (Robinson, 1967): \n\nF (f) = Gs (f) Hs (f)                                                                                                                  (3.23) \n\nwhere   F(f)              T(y); Gs (f)            ?   \n\nHs(f) = Frequency characteristic of the resistivity filter, or simply the filter characteristic.  \n\nThe symbol             denotes a Fourier transform pair. \n\nTo determine the filter characteristic, following partial resistivity function for the Schlumberger \n\nsystem was chosen whose exact resistivity transform was known (Koefoed, 1968).  \n\n \n\n ?

For a given sampling interval ?x the Nyquist \n\nfrequency is fN = 1/(2?x) , and the corresponding sinc-response function is given by: \n ? ?                                                                               (3.26) \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nThe apparent resistivity ?  in the sampling points xi = i?x is then given approximately by: \n\n? ?       ? ?                                                                        (3.27) \nwhere  and are chosen so that the filter coefficients with smaller or larger indices can be \n\nneglected. As the expression of the apparent resistivity function is complicated, the Fourier \n\ntransform of the T(y) functions were first determined and the Fourier transform of the apparent \n\nresistivity functions were then obtained from it by the application of (3.23) (Ghosh, 1971). \n\nFourier transform of the T(y) functions were estimated in Johansen, (1975). Apart from the \n\nsampling frequency there are two factors affecting the accuracy: the tails of the filter must be cut \n\noff at some point, and the coefficients can only be calculated with a limited precision. The \n\nanalysis of the asymptotic behavior (demonstrated in Johansen, 1975) indicates that j= (-100) \u2013 \n\n(40) fulfills the expectations. The filter coefficients corresponding to a sampling frequency of 10 \n\npoints per decade were calculated in Johansen, (1975) and the actual precision of the filter was \n\nalso tested and proved in the same way as suggested by Ghosh, (1971). \n\n \n\n3.2.4. 1D resistivity inversion  \n\nLet the m-dimensional vector p (pl, p2... pn) stand for the m = 2N-1 resistivities and thicknesses \n\n(?1, dl, ... , ?N) i.e. \n\n                                                                                          (3.29) \n\n                                                                                    (3.30) \n\nAnd  \n\n                                                            (3.31)\n\nLet Yi be the measured values of ?app at abscissas ?i, i= 1, ... , n.

RES2DINV is a computer \n\nprogram that will automatically determine a two dimensional (2-D) resistivity model for the \n\nsubsurface for the data obtained from electrical imaging surveys (Griffiths and Barker, 1993). \n\nThis program is designed to invert large data sets collected with a system with a large number of \n\nelectrodes. The 2-D model used by the inversion program, which consists of a number of \n\nrectangular blocks, is shown in Figure 3.10. The arrangement of the blocks is loosely tied to the \n\ndistribution of the data points in the pseudosection. The distribution and size of the blocks is \n\nautomatically generated by the program using the distribution of the data points as a rough guide. \n\nThe depth of the bottom row of blocks is set to be approximately equal to the equivalent depth of \n\ninvestigation (Edwards, 1977) of the data points with the largest electrode spacing. The survey is \n\nusually carried out with a system where the electrodes are arranged along a line with a constant \n\nspacing between adjacent electrodes. A forward modeling subroutine is used to calculate the \n\napparent resistivity values, and a non-linear least-squares optimization technique is used for the \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\ninversion routine (deGroot-Hedlin and Constable, 1990; Loke and Barker, 1996). The program \n\nsupports both the finite-difference and finite-element forward modeling techniques and covers \n\nWenner, pole-pole, dipole-dipole, pole-dipole, Wenner-Schlumberger and equatorial dipole-\n\ndipole (rectangular) arrays. In addition to these common arrays, the program even supports non-\n\nconventional arrays with an almost unlimited number of possible electrode configurations (Loke, \n\n2001) \n\n \n\nFig.3.10. Arrangement of the blocks used in a model together with the data points in the pseudosection \n\n \n\n3.3.Time-lapse Inversion \n\nThe major aim of time-lapse inversion is to identify changes in resistivity at selected locations at \n\ndifferent times accurately. Independent data inversions can be carried out separately and changes \n\nin ERT images with time can be obtained by simply subtraction of pixel-by-pixel values from a \n\nbackground image, but in most cases, changes over time do not guarantee that the differences in \n\nresistivity values are only due to actual changes in the subsurface resistivity without taking the \n\nreference model and priori information into account Deiana et al. (2007). Different time-lapse \n\ninversion techniques are proposed to achieve accurate images of electrical conductivity \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nvariations. The ratio method, the difference inversion and the cross-model regularization are \n\ncommonly used in time-lapse inversion methods.  \n\nThe ratio method was proposed by Daily et al. (1992). In this method, ratios of initial and \n\nsubsequent datasets are inverted to highlight the areas of resistivity changes. This method has \n\nbeen widely used to monitor resistivity changes (e.g. Binley et al., 2002b). Presenting a \n\nquantitative resistivity change estimates are difficult for interpretation of petrophysical models, \n\nbut this approach can give a qualitative indication where resistivity changes are occurring \n\n(Hayley et al. 2011) \n\nLaBrecque and Yang, (2001) proposed the difference inversion method. This method minimizes \n\nthe misfit between the difference in two datasets and the difference between two model \n\nresponses and smoothness is imposed directly on the time-lapse model change. This approach \n\nhas been used for instance by Kemna et al. (2002) for tracer test monitoring and by Diena et al. \n\n(2007) for characterization of vadose zone via water injection. \n\nThe crossmodel regularization assumes that the material changes can be ignored during data \n\ncollection and therefore a time-invariant static model is used in this method. The inversion result \n\nof an initial dataset is used as a reference model for the inversion of subsequent datasets (Loke, \n\n1999; Oldenborger et al., 2007) in this approach. This method minimizes the changes in the EC \n\nimage that are not supported by data through adding a constraint that the second inversion result \n\nshould be similar to the first. Both crossmodel inversion and difference inversion require an \n\nindependent inversion of the first dataset. Therefore, artifacts in the initial independent inversion \n\nwill introduce artifacts into the time-lapse inversion. Moreover, LaBrecque et al. (1996b) noticed \n\nthat the initial dataset collected with permanently installed electrodes was the nosiest, thus, using \n\nthese methods will cause serious consequence if the initial dataset includes considerable level of \n\nnoise. \n\nHayley et al. (2011) presented a comprehensive comparison of the above mentioned methods \n\nusing the results of two examples. The authors found out that the ratio method is very sensitive to \n\nnoise. They also reported the difficulties they had with crossmodel regularization to not \n\nintroduce anomalies into the difference image due to differences in the resolution of the \n\nbackground structure between the two inversions and necessity of heavy regularization to \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\novercome this weakness. They found that the difference inversion approach produces the best \n\nresolution of time-lapse changes among the commonly used approach and less susceptible to \n\nnoise than the ratio method and crossmodel regularization. They mentioned that a careful \n\nselection of inversion parameters in the first inversion should be taken to resolve the background \n\nstructure and avoid introducing artifacts into the difference inversion. \n\nKim et al. (2009) defined a subsurface structure and the entire monitoring data in the space\u2013time \n\ndomain to obtain a four-dimensional space\u2013time model using just one inversion process. They \n\ndeveloped a new least-squares inversion algorithm that allows for the subsurface properties to \n\ncontinuously change in time. They introduced the regularizations not only in the space domain \n\nbut also in time, resulting in reduced inversion artifacts and improved stability of the inverse \n\nproblem. The algorithm was designed to provide reasonable subsurface images even if changes \n\nin the subsurface properties during the data acquisition cannot be ignored.  \n\n \n\n3.4.Electrical conductivity of Soils \n\nElectric current flows in earth materials at shallow depths through two main methods namely \n\nelectronic conduction and electrolytic conduction. In electronic conduction, the current flow is \n\nvia free electrons, such as in metals while, in electrolytic conduction, the current flow is via the \n\nmovement of ions in groundwater. In our study for soil characterization, electrolytic conduction \n\nis the main mechanism. Sedimentary rocks usually have resistivity range from 10 to about 10000 \n\n?.m, with most values below 1000 ?.m. Unconsolidated sediments generally have lower \n\nresistivity values than sedimentary rocks; with values ranging from about 10 to less than 1000 \n\n?.m. Clayey soil normally has a lower resistivity value than sandy soil. However, the overlaps in \n\nthe resistivity values of the different classes of soils are usually expected. This is because the \n\nresistivity of a particular rock or soil sample depends on a number of factors such as the porosity, \n\nthe degree of water saturation and the concentration of dissolved salts.  \n\nThe widely used relationship between resistivity and soil moisture is expressed as (Archie, 1942) \n\n                                                                                                                    (3.35) \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nwhere a, m, and n are petrophysical constants that are characteristic of the porous medium,  is  \n\nthe resistivity of the porous medium,  is the pore-water resistivity, ? is the porosity, and S is \n\nsaturation, which is the ratio of the water content and porosity. During an infiltration event, the \n\nmoisture content of a geological medium is generally the only factor that undergoes dramatic \n\nchanges, and the changes in resistivity can be related to changes in moisture content.  \n\n \n\n3.5.  Hydrologic Model \n\n3.5.1. Governing Flow Equation  \nRichards\u2019 equation is used to describe variably saturated flow in porous media. Three-\n\ndimensional Richards\u2019 equation can be expressed as: \n\n                                          (3.36) \n\nwhere h [L] is pressure head, z [L] is elevation, ? is volumetric moisture,  and  are \n\nthe horizontal and vertical unsaturated hydraulic conductivity [L/T] respectively as a function of \n\npressure head. The system is isotropic if . Equation (3.36) must be supplemented \n\nwith relevant constitutive models linking h, ? and K.  \n\n \n\n3.5.2. The Unsaturated Soil Hydraulic Properties \nThe unsaturated soil hydraulic properties, ?(h) and K(h), in (3.36) are in general highly nonlinear \n\nfunctions of the pressure head. Five different analytical models for the hydraulic properties were \n\nproposed by Brooks and Corey, (1964); van Genuchten, (1980); Vogel and C\u00edslerov\u00e1, (1988); \n\nKosugi, (1995) and Durner, (1994) and commonly used in flow simulations. We assume here \n\nthat the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions can be represented by the parametric \n\nmodels of van Genuchten, (1980) who used the statistical pore-size distribution model of \n\nMualem, (1976) to obtain a predictive equation for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity \n\nfunction in terms of soil water retention parameters: \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n, 0\n1 1/\n\n( ) 1 ( ) , 0\nmn\n\nr r\n\nf h\nm n\n\nf h h\n?\n\n? ? ?\n?\n\n???\n= = ??\n\n? ?+ ? ? + ?&lt;? ? ??\n                                                        (3.37) \n\n( )\n2\n\n1/ 2 1/\n\n, 0\n\n1 1 ) , 0\nr\n\nm m\nr\n\nKs h\nK Se\n\nfKs Kr Ks Se Se h\n? ?\n\n?\n\n?? ??\n= =? ? ? ?? = ? ? ? ?&lt;? ? ??\n\n                                         (3.38) \n\n \n\nWhere ?s is the saturated water content, ?r is the residual water content, defined as the water \n\ncontent for which the gradient ?  becomes zero, ? and n are empirical parameters and Ks is \n\nthe saturated hydraulic conductivity (Simunek et al, 2006). Therefore, to achieve an infiltration \n\nmodel, all five van Genuchten\u00b4s parameters (?r, ?s, ?, n, and Ks) must be first estimated. These \n\nparameters were estimated by using the Rosetta software (Schaap et al. 2001). Rosetta \n\nimplements pedotransfer functions based on artificial neural networks which predict water \n\nretention and saturated hydraulic conductivity from soil textural data and bulk density. In \n\naddition, we also used mini disk infiltrometer to evaluate these parameters in our study in the \n\nfield. \n\n \n\n3.5.3. 1D Flow Simulation \nA one-dimensional of Richards\u2019 equation (3.36) is expressed by: \n\nH\nK\n\nt z z\n?? ? ?? ?\n\n= ? ?? ? ?? ?\n                                                                                                                               (3.39) \n\nThe Richards\u2019 equation can be solved based on either h- or ?- form of the Richards equation to \n\ndescribe flow in a variably saturated soil. (e.g. Davis and Neuman, 1983; Huyakorn et al., 1983, \n\n1989; Hills et al., 1989; Kool and Van Genuchten, 1991; Kirkland et al., 1992). A limitation of \n\nthe ? -based formulation is that this form cannot be used to describe flow in the saturated zone, \n\nand flow in layered soils is also not easily simulated. The h-based formulation of (3.39) is \n\nconsidered to be more useful for practical problems involving flow in layered or spatially \n\nheterogeneous soils, as well as for variably saturated flow problems. Unfortunately, simulation \n\nof infiltration using the h-based formulation also often faces difficulties in conserving mass. \n\n(Haung et al. 1995) \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nIn this study, h-based formulation was used to develop a 1d coupled geoelectric-infiltration \n\nmodel for unsaturated hydraulic parameters characterization and we briefly discuss how to \n\nnumerically solve Equation (3.39) using h-based formulation by finite difference approach. \n\nThe water content, ? in Equation (3.39) is dependent on the pressure head, h. Therefore  term \n\ncan be expressed as  . The  term is equal to c(h) and is the water capacity (1/m). Let \n\nretention and hydraulic conductivity functions can be represented by (3.37) and (3.38). \n\nTherefore, c(h) can be expressed by: \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                  (3.40) \n\n \n\nwe added 10-20 to the function to aid in the numerical solution, which can be sensitive to values \n\nof c(h) = 0.  \n\nUsing the definition of total head, H = z+h, and applying    term to equation (3.39), we get \n\nthe flowing expression of 1d Richards\u2019 equation: \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                  (3.41) \n\nThe ordinary finite difference was applied to get following equation: \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                  (3.42) \n\nwhere Kim is the mean conductivity between the grid points at zi and zi-1, and Kip is the mean \n\nconductivity between the grid points at zi+1 and zi .We should estimate an average of the values \n\nof Ki-1 and Ki for Kim and Ki and Ki+1 for Kip, to calculate flow from Darcy's law between zi-1 and \n\nzi. The arithmetic means, Kim = (Ki-1+Ki)/2 and Kip = (Ki+Ki+1)/2 were used in this approach. \n\nBecause of the time-stepping method we use here, all the other variables, ci and Ki, are taken \n\n20\n\n1\n20\n\n1\n\n10 , 0\n( ) ( )( ) 10 , 0\n\n1 ( )\n\nn\nr\n\nmn\n\nh\nf n m hc h hh\n\nh\n\n?\n? ? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n+\n\n? ?\n?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?= ? ? +&lt;? ? ? ?+ ?? ? ??\n\n( ) 1\nh h h\n\nc h K\nh t t z z\n? ? ?? ? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? = = ? +? ?? ?? ? ? ? ?? ?? ?\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 11\n\nj j j j j j\ni i i i i i\n\ni ip im ip im\nh h h h h h\n\nc K K K K\nt z z z\n\n+ + + + +\n+ ?? ?? ? ?= ? ? + ? ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nfrom the values of hij and j and j+1 time levels are only given to the pressure head. In a truly \n\nimplicit solution, j time level solution would all be taken from the j+1 time level.  The only way \n\nto numerically solve (3.42) is to repeatedly calculate the time step, each time recalculating the \n\nvalues of ci and Ki with the updated values of hij+1 until solution converges to a fixed limit \n\n(Barker and Scott, 1998). The tridiagonal system of equations away from the boundaries may be \n\nrearranged to:   \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                  (3.43) \n\nwhere rzz = ?t/?z2 and rz = ?t/?z.  \n\nWe will assume that the bottom boundary at z0 is a constant pressure head, h0, therefore for \n\nbottom boundary, the equation is expressed by:  \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                  (3.44) \n\n \n\nThe infiltration flow at the upper boundary condition requires special treatment. We consider that \n\nthe mean flow between two grid points zi and zi+1. Since, the space steps, ?z, are uniform; we \n\ncenter qi+1/2 halfway between. In order to put the infiltration, qinf, at the soil surface, the \n\ncoordinate system was shifts up by ?z/2 (Barker and Scott, 1998). This does not change the \n\nfinite difference equations, but changes our interpretation of where they solve. \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                  (3.45) \n\nThe Mass Balance equation above shows how this approach works. We replace only the flow \n\nbetween znp-1 and znp-2 with Darcy's law, leaving the soil surface flow, qinf, intact. Therefore after   \n\nproper substitutions into equation (3.43) for the top boundary, we get the following equation:   \n\n                                                                                                                    \n\n( )( )\n( )\n\n1 1 1\n1 1\n\nj j j\nim i i im ip i ip i\n\nj\ni i ip im\n\nrzz K h c rzz K K h rzz K h\n\nc h rz K K\n\n+ + +\n? +? ? ? + + ? + ? ? ? ? =\n\n? + ? ?\n\n1 1\n1 21/ 2 1/ 2 inf( ) 1\n\nj j\nnp npi i im\n\nh hq q Kqh q\nc h\n\nt z z z z z\n\n+ +\n? ?+ ?\n\n? ??? + ?? ?\n? = ? ? = ? ? +? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ?\n\n( )( )\n( )\n\n1 1\n1 2\n\n1 0\n\nj j\ni im ip ip\n\nj\ni ip im im\n\nc rzz K K h rzz K h\n\nc h rz K K rzz K h\n\n+ ++ ? + ? ? ? ? =\n\n? + ? ? + ? ?\n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                  (3.46) \n\n \n\nAll flows are positive upwards in our coordinate system, so the infiltration flow, qinf, must be \n\nnegative during rain and positive for evaporation.  \n\nAs was discussed, the head-based approach used in this study, is known to produce mass balance \n\nerrors. In other words, the change in water content does not match the net inflow. Celia et al. \n\n(1987) and Celia et al. (1990) proposed a mass-conservative numerical scheme to solve the \n\nmixed-form Richards equation: \n\n                                                                                                                                                  (3.47) \n\n \n\nThe modified Picard method solves the mixed-q/h-form of Richards\u2019 equation. The mixed form \n\nof the Richards equation was thought to maintain the mass conservative property inherent in the \n\n?-based equation, while providing solutions in terms of the pressure head, h.  \n\n \n\n3.5.4. HYDRUS Package \nHYDRUS is a general software package for simulating water, heat, and solute movement in two- \n\nand three- dimensional variably saturated media (Simunek et al., 2006). The software package \n\nconsists of the computation computer program, and the interactive graphics-based user interface. \n\nThe HYDRUS program numerically solves the Richards equation for saturated unsaturated water \n\nflow and the convection-dispersion equation for heat and solute transport. The Galerkin finite \n\nelement method (Neuman, 1975; Zienkiewicz, 1977; Pinder and Gray, 1977) with linear basis \n\nfunctions is used to obtain a solution of the flow in equation (3.36) subject to the imposed initial \n\nand boundary conditions. The HYDRUS code uses the mass conservative method proposed by \n\nCelia et al. (1990). \n\n \n\n \n\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 111\n\nj j j j j j\ni i i i i i\n\nip im\nH H H Hh\n\nK K K\nt z z t z z z\n\n? ?? + + + + ++ ?? ?? ? ? ? ?? ? ?? ?= ? + ? = ? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ? ? ?\n\n( )\n( )\n\n1 1\n2 1 1\n\n1 1 inf\n\nj j\nim np np im np\n\nj\nnp np im\n\nrzz K h c rzz K h\n\nc h rz K q\n\n+ +\n? ? ?\n\n? ?\n\n? ? ? + + ? ? =\n\n? ? ? +\n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n3.5.5.  Mini disk infiltrometer \nMini disk infiltrometers are being considerably used for in-situ measurement of the unsaturated \n\nhydraulic properties of soil. These data are commonly used to evaluate the saturated and \n\nunsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Simunek and van Genuchten, (1996) discussed on how to \n\nestimate parameters in van Genuchten\u2019s model of the unsaturated soil-hydraulic properties from \n\nobserved cumulative infiltration data during transient water flow. They showed that the \n\ninfiltration data measured at only a constant tension does not yield enough information to \n\nestimate more than 2 parameters. They also showed how information could improve the \n\nuniqueness of the solution. Simunek and van Genuchten, (1997) continued their study with \n\nconsidering several different scenarios with using different additional information and concluded \n\nthat the best practical scenario is to estimate the parameters in van Genuchten\u2019s model from the \n\ncumulative infiltration curve measured at several consecutive tensions applied to the soil surface, \n\nin conjunction with knowledge of the initial and final water content. We used the DISC computer \n\nsoftware (developed by Simunek and Van Genuchten, 2000) for analyzing the cumulative \n\ninfiltration curve. A Marquardt-Levenberg type parameter optimization algorithm is used in this \n\nsoftware for inverse estimation of soil hydraulic properties from measured transient cumulative \n\ninfiltration and related data. \n\n \n\n3.6. Moment analysis \n\n2D spatial moments were calculated from the resistivity images according to \n\n                                                                                              (3.48) \n\nThe zeroth, first and second spatial moments correspond to i + j + k = 0, 1, and 2, respectively. \n\n?  is the water content changes based on the resistivity changes estimation (inferred from time-\n\nlapse ERT images), where the background water content has been removed.  is the volume of \n\ninterest (For a full description of moment analysis, see e.g. Ye et al., 2005). \n\nIn moment analysis, the mass of the system and location of the center of mass and how the mass \n\nspread at consecutive times is quantified. The zeroth moment, M00, is the mass in the system. \n\nThe first moment, M01 normalized by the mass, defines the vertical center of mass and finally \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nthe spread of the mass about its centre is related to the second spatial moment. For instance, the \n\nvertical spread of water in flow direction is defined using following equation: \n\n                                                                                                                        (3.49) \n \n\n3.7. Soil test \n\nSoil texture test is a qualitative classification tool to determine the Particle-size distribution \n\n(PSD) for soils. The texture of the soil depends on the relative sizes and shapes of the particles, \n\nand the distribution of those sizes. The classes are separated by the relative proportions of sand, \n\nsilt and clay using grading sieves. The class is then used to determine the soils responses to \n\nenvironmental and management conditions and also crop suitability. Based on the textures the \n\nsoil can be divided into two coarse (sand and gravel) and fine (silt and clay) grained soils groups. \n\nThe particle-size separation was carried out in two following steps: \n\n \n3.7.1.  Sieve Analysis \n\n \nStandard set of sieves are used to divide sand into classes, and to separate sand fractions from silt \n\nand clay fractions in the soil. The silt and clay fractions cannot be distinguished from one \n\nanother by sieve analysis. For soil sieving analysis, following steps were performed:  \n\n \n\n1. The soil samples were mixed with water and then were washed trough the sieves 0.063 \n\nmm. The retained soils on the sieves were collected and oven-dried for sieving analysis. \n\n2. All pieces of visible organic matter from the soil sample were removed. \n\n3. Approximately 50 g of each soil sample was weighted and the exact weight (Ws) was \n\nrecorded. \n\n4. The sieves, with the largest mesh on the top by successively finer meshes beneath were \n\nplaced. Samples were then poured into top sieve. The samples were shaken for 15 \n\nminutes using a shaker. \n\n5. Residues from each sieve were carefully collected for weighing.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n3.7.2.  Malvern Particle Size Analyzer \n \n\nTo determine the \u2018clay to silt ratio\u2019, the fraction of the soil passing through the last (0.063 mm) \n\nsieve was analyzed using laser granulometer Malvern Particle Size Analyzer MS2000 after \n\ndeflocculating with 30% sodium hexametaphosphate. The principle of operation consists in \n\nmeasuring the size of particles using the diffraction and diffusion of a laser beam. These particles \n\nscatter light at an angle that is inversely proportional to their size. The angular intensity of the \n\nscattered light is then measured by a series of photosensitive detectors. The map of scattering \n\nintensity versus angle is the primary source of information used to calculate the particle size.  \n\n \n\n3.8. Soil moisture measurement  \n\nMethods of soil moisture determination are classified into direct and indirect methods (Mu\u00f1oz-\n\nCarpena, 2004).  \n\n \n\n3.8.1. Direct methods \nIn direct methods, the weight of a soil sample is measured before and after oven drying. The \n\nremoval of moisture from a soil sample in this process is commonly referred as gravimetric \n\nmoisture content (kg/kg). Measurement of soil bulk density then enables the gravimetric \n\nmoisture content to be converted to volumetric moisture content which is expressed as a volume \n\nof water in a volume of undisturbed soil (m3/m3) (Hossain, 2008). \n\n \n\n3.8.2.  Indirect methods \nIndirect measurement methods are based on the estimation of physical and chemical properties \n\nof a soil such as electrical conductivity, heat capacity, dielectric constant, hydrogen content or \n\nmagnetic susceptibility that ultimately relates to soil moisture content (Hossain, 2008). \n\nIn this study, a capacitance sensor from Sentek Company was used to monitor moisture content \n\nvariations during the experiment in order to control the geophysical approach. The capacitance \n\ntechnique for soil moisture determination involves the measurement of the soil dielectric \n\nconstant by measuring the capacitance between two electrodes of a probe placed into the soil \n\nprofile. The dielectric constant is a measure of the capacity of a non-conducting material to \n\ntransmit electromagnetic waves or pulses. The theory of the capacitance technique was described \n\nby Dean et al. (1987) and Whalley et al. (1992). The capacitance change of the soil-water-air \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nmatrix is mainly governed by the soil moisture content as the dielectric constant of water is 81, \n\nmuch higher than that of other soil components i.e. soil minerals and soil air valued of 2-5 and 1 \n\nrespectively (Evett and Steiner, 1995; Mu\u00f1oz-Carpena, 2004). Therefore, the measurement of the \n\ndielectric constant of a soil is primarily determined by the volumetric soil moisture content. \n\n \n\n3.9. Temperature Changes \n\nThe goal of this experiment is to monitor electrical resistivity changes due to variations in the \n\nwater content in the unsaturated zone. In order to accomplish this, all other transient factors that \n\naffect the soil must be accounted for. Temperature has a strong influence on the electrical \n\nconductivity of the subsurface (Sen and Goode, 1992; Waxman and Thomas, 1974). Rein et al. \n\n(2004) studied the effect of temperature, soil moisture, and temporal variation of the ambient \n\nionic concentration on tracer tests, and concluded that even diurnal temperature variations can \n\nhave a relatively large effect. Yet in most time-lapse studies, the influence of temperature \n\nvariations has not been accounted for. Several attempts have clearly accounted for subsurface \n\ntemperature variation in resistivity map (e.g. Hauck, 2002; Michot et al., 2003; Hayley et al., \n\n2007; Hayley et al., 2009). It is common practice in electrical geophysics to assume a linear \n\nvariation in resistivity with temperature over the typical range of temperatures encountered in \n\nshallow surveys (Musgrave and Binley, 2011).  Sch\u00f6n, (2004) for instance proposed a 2.5% \n\nchange in electrical resistivity per \u00b0C change in temperature. Hayley et al. (2007) using a variety \n\nof near surface materials found out that the slope of the low temperature linear model is quite \n\nconsistent and a value between 1.8% and 2.2% change in electrical resistivity per \u00baC change in \n\ntemperature can be used if no other information is available.  \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nUsing EM38 and ERT methods in soil \n\ncharacterization at the campus of university of \n\nLisbon \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n4. Study of EM38 and ERT methods at the Campus of University of Lisbon \n\nStudy of the EM38 sensor and ERT were conducted in the campus of university on a loam soil \n\nwith low permeability and high water retention capacity under natural condition and forced-\n\ninfiltration experiment in order to monitor moisture content changes and hydraulic conductivity \n\nestimation. This chapter investigates the result of the EM38 and ERT data to detect and describe \n\nthe soil moisture content. In addition, the ability of the EM38 and ERT methods in hydraulic \n\nconductivity estimation are evaluated using the flow simulations and EM38 and ERT images \n\ncomparison. \n\n \n\n4.1. Soil Test \n\nFour soil cores down to a depth of approximately 1.5-2m were extracted along the profile in 3 \n\nand 6m in 2-Dec 2010, 9m in 21-Apr 2011 and 12m in 20-June 2011. These cores were \n\nsectioned into 0.2 m lengths and prepared for laboratory analysis of physical properties namely \n\nparticle density, bulk density, texture and gravimetric moisture content. The texture of extracted \n\nsoil samples from 6 and 9 meters are shown in Fig.4.1 and Fig.4.2. the method discussed in 3.7 \n\nwere used to determine soil texture. The particle size distribution analysis of all four boreholes \n\nindicates a fairly homogeneous soil with Loam texture class composed of 30-50%, 40-50% and \n\n15-25% concentration of sand, silt and clay respectively. The analysis of the third and fourth \n\nboreholes in 9 and 12 m shows a slightly greater sand concentration and lower amount of clay \n\nand silt contents than the first and second borehole. The average concentration of sand, silt and \n\nclay in the first and second borehole is about 35.5%, 45% and 19.5% respectively while in the \n\nthird and fourth borehole is 41%, 43.5% and 15.5% respectively. Moreover, particle densities for \n\nthe second, fifth and last samples of each core were measured by pycnometer in the lab. The \n\nestimated particle density was 2.65 with 0.03 tolerances. Bulk density measured using clod \n\nmethod was 1.72 with 0.05 tolerances. Therefore, the average porosity is about 35%.  \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \nFig.4.1.

Geophysical monitoring \n\nThe evolution of the moisture distribution were monitored by the ground surface ERT and multi-\n\nheight EM38 surveys since 28-Oct 2010 until 20-Jun 2011. Geophysical surveys were repeated \n\nweekly. If the equipment were available, ERT and EM38 were collected at the same day. Fig.4.3 \n\nshows a view of geophysical acquisition at field site. \n\n \n\n \nFig.4.3. A view of geophysical acquisition at field site using ground surface ERT and multi height EM38 \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Geoeletrical monitoring  \nIn this experiment a 2D ground surface ERT survey was performed. Wenner, Schlumberger and \n\nDipole-Dipole electrode configurations were employed using 4 point light 10W devise. \n\nExpansion and electrode spacing were 14.25m and 0.75 respectively. A total of 57, 81 and 153 \n\nmeasurements were made for each dataset respectively using Wenner, Schlumberger and Dipole-\n\nDipole electrode configurations. The first ERT dataset in 28-Oct 2010 was inverted so as to \n\ngenerate background images. Fig 4.4 presents the results of background image. The modeling \n\nresults indicate smooth resistivity variations along the profile. Greater resistivity values are seen \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\non the right side of the models where the soil texture analysis indicates lower clay content \n\nconcentration. While there is a high similarity between models generated using Wenner and \n\nSchlumberger electrode configurations, using a Dipole-Dipole electrode configuration resulted in \n\na model that showed greater resistivity values along the profile and a slightly different pattern of \n\nresistivity.  \n\nIn the next step, the time-lapse ERT data was inverted by RES2DINVx32 ver. 3.71. This version \n\nwas developed based on Kim et al. (2009) method. Effect of change in temperature with respect \n\nto background dataset was removed from all ERT data by applying a value of 2% change per \n\ndegree before inversion. Fig. 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 show the results of resistivity inversions in terms of \n\npercentage resistivity changes with respect to background obtained using Wenner, Schlumberger \n\nand Dipole-Dipole electrode configurations respectively in 4-Nov 2010, 11-Feb, 21-Apr and 20- \n\nJun 2011. It is worth mentioning that, the first dataset (4-Nov 2010) were collected with four \n\ndays delay after three days continuous rain with amount of 75, 60 and 10 mm respectively. The \n\nsecond dataset (11-Feb 2011) were collected by two weeks delay after the last rain, the third \n\nshown dataset were surveyed immediately after the rain and finally the last shown dataset were \n\ncollected in dry season. The decrease of resistivity during the rain period is clearly visible in the \n\nfirst and third shown models in Fig.4.5-7 (a, c). In contrast, there is no remarkable change in the \n\nsecond dataset in Fig.4.5-6 (b) and finally last model shown in Fig.4.5-7 (d) show a considerable \n\nresistivity increase in dry season. A comparison of the obtained models using different electrode \n\nconfigurations show  an obvious similarity between Wenner and Schlumberger electrode \n\nconfigurations results, while Dipole-Dipole electrode configuration show a greater change with \n\nmore scatter distribution.

The EM38 \n \n\nEM38 measurements were made in the vertical (EM38v) and horizontal (EM38h) modes of \n\noperation with 0.75m separation along the profile. Consequently 20 points were measured in \n\neach survey. Given the operating frequency of the EM38 (i.e. 14.5 kHz) and coil spacing (1.0 m), \n\nthe theoretical depth of exploration is 1.5 and 0.75m respectively for EM38V and EM38h when \n\nthe instrument is placed on the ground. To facilitate multi-height EM38 measurement, a \n\nspecially-designed polymer-plastic ladder (Fig.4.3) was constructed at heights corresponding to \n\n0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 m. EM38 measurements were collected in both vertical and horizontal in \n\nmentioned heights. Fig.4.8 shows the apparent soil electrical conductivity (mS/m) data collected \n\nin 28-Oct 2010 using EM38 in vertical and horizontal modes of operation. Joint inversion of \n\nmulti-height EM38 measurements was carried out using the algorithm proposed by Santos, \n\n(2004). The data of each survey was inverted considering a same initial five- layer earth model. \n\nThe first four layers were initialized with the same depth of 0.3m and electrical conductivity of \n\n15, 20, 25 and 35 mS/m respectively from the ground surface. The electrical conductivity of the \n\nlast layer was selected to be 50 mS/m. These values were estimated based on the apparent soil \n\nelectrical conductivity values collected by EM38 and the resistivity model obtained in previous \n\nsection. Fig 4.9 (a-c) shows the inverted models of the first EM38 dataset measured in 28-Oct \n\n2010. These models were generated using all 8 dataset shown in Fig.4.8 by applying the 1-D \n\nlaterally constrained inversion and using different values of damping factor. Each model was \n\nobtained after 15 iterations. Fig.4.9a was obtained using a small damping factor of ?= 0.3 which \n\ncorresponds to a less constrained inversion. The response of this model with total misfit of \n\n4.85% shows a robust model with significant lateral changes along the profile. The background \n\nresistivity value of this model is about 35 ohm.m which is reasonably consistent with the \n\ngeoelectrical model. Fig.4.9b was obtained using damping factor value of 3. The resistivity \n\nchanges along the profile are smoother than the first model, but the lateral changes are still \n\nobvious in this model. The misfit error is slightly greater than the first model with 5.18%. Finally \n\nthe last model using ? = 30 is shown in Fig.4.9c. This high damping factor (k) forces the \n\ncalculation of a solution with a significant degree of smoothness for a more uniform model. The \n\nmodel shows very smooth changes along the profile and there is a substantial disagreement \n\nbetween model obtained using ? = 30 with the geoelectrical model response in section 4.2.1 and \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nsoil texture test results. The total misfit is 7.67% which is greater than the first and second \n\nmodels. \n\nAll EM38 dataset collected during one year, were inverted through the same procedure using \n\ndamping factor values of 0.3,3 and 30 (not shown here). The models then were analyzed and \n\ncompared with resistivity model produced in section 4.2.1. We figured out that when ? = 3 the \n\nmodels well reflect the resistivity changes in our study. Although, small values of ? yield better \n\nfit, the lateral changes were exaggerated and artificial anomalies were produced in many cases. \n\nFurthermore, after finding the suitable value for damping factor, we inverted all EM38 datasets \n\nusing vertical and horizontal modes of operation on the ground and 0.3m height level where \n\nshows the significant changes in raw data along the profile. Our analysis indicates that using only \n\nthese data slightly improves the models and reduces the total misfit. Fig.4.9d shows the obtained \n\nmodel using the ground surface and 0.3m height data with a damping factor of 3. Therefore, for \n\nfurther investigation we used the models which were obtained using vertical and horizontal \n\nmodes of operation of the ground surface and 0.3m height level by applying a damping factor of \n\n3 and 15 iterations. An investigation of EM38 background model in Fig.4.9d shows smooth \n\nresistivity changes along the profile with the average resistivity of 30 ohm.m. The model shows a \n\nvery good consistency with ERT images in resistivity changes along the profile. Higher \n\nresistivity values are seen in the right and left upper zone of the profile. Afterward, independent \n\nEM38 datasets inversions were carried out separately. Obtained model were changed by \n\nsubtracting pixel-by-pixel values from a background image. The effect of the temperature change \n\nwith respect to background in 28-Oct 2010 was removed from EM38 data before inversion. \n\nFig.4.10 (a-e) show the results of multi-height EM38 data inversions in terms of percentage \n\nresistivity changes with regard to background in 4 and 25-Nov 2010, 20-Jan, 11-Feb and 20- Jun \n\n2011. The EM38 data in 4-Nov 2010, 11-Feb and 20- Jun 2011 (Fig.4.10a, c, d) were collected \n\nright before ERT surveys in these days. Although there is some difference between trends of \n\nresistivity changes inferred from EM38 and ERT images, pattern of results are reasonably \n\nsimilar. Both EM38 and ERT results show a decrease during the rain period in 4-Nov 2010 and a \n\nsignificant increase in 20- Jun 2011 in dry season. The second dataset (25-Nov 2010) were \n\ncollected after 12 days of continuous rain amounting to170 mm. The model obtained in 25-Nov \n\n2010 shows the greatest resistivity changes during the experiment with an average of 20% \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\ndecrease with regard to background. The maximum increase (about 20%) in both ERT andEM38 \n\nimages are seen in dry season in 20 Jun 2011 as expected.  \n\n \nFig.4.8.

In-situ resistivity and saturation relationship \n\nTo determine changes in soil moisture from ERT images, we did not assume the validity of \n\nArchie\u2019s law. In fact, we established an in-situ approach based on ? vs. S changes by plotting the \n\ninverted value of resistivity of the extracted sample as a function of the saturation. The plot \n\nallowed us to obtain an empirical relationship between ? and S from the best match of the \n\nexperimental data. To achieve this objective, we used the ERT images collected right before \n\nsampling and then the inverted resistivity values of related pixels were extracted and plotted as a \n\nfunction of saturation (Fig.4.11, a-c) to find out the best match of resistivity-moisture content \n\nchanges. The obtained relationship is given by the following equation:  \n\n                                                                                                           (4.1a) \n\n                                                                                                              (4.1b) \n\n                                                                                                              (4.1c) \n\nwhere S is the degree of saturation and ,  and  are the resistivity of the porous \n\nmedium in relevant degree of saturation obtained using Wenner, Schlumberger and Dipole-\n\nDipole electrode configurations respectively. The resistivity and saturation shows a strong \n\nrelationship in all electrode configurations in this study. The same procedure was applied to \n\ndetermine changes in soil moisture from EM38 images. The resistivity- saturation changes were \n\nplotted in Fig.4.11 (d). Resistivity and saturation shows weaker relationship in comparison with \n\nERT images and expressed by:  \n\n                                                                                                          (4.1d) \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n\n \n\ny = 18.683x-1.813\nR\u00b2 = 0.959\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n\n?\n(?\n\n.m\n)\n\nS\n\na)\n\ny = 20.243x-1.703\nR\u00b2 = 0.9372\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n\n?\n(?\n\n.m\n)\n\nS\n\nb)\n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.4.11.

Soil moisture measurement using capacitance sensor \n\nTwo Sentek PVC access tubes were fitted immediately after digging two holes in x=6 and x=9 \n\nmeters. Access tubes were pushed down the hole to the depth of 2 m for the measuring probes. \n\nTubes were fitted well to the soil to prevent vertical leaking of surface water around the tube and \n\nto minimize air gaps. One capacitance sensor was used and data was collected every 0.1 m in \n\ndepth along the access tubes. Soil moisture measurements were started in 16- Dec, 2010 and \n\nwere repeated weekly until March, 2011 for four months.  \n\nBefore readings, the sensor was normalized to air and water. Afterwards, volumetric soil water \n\ncontent was estimated by following equation: \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                       (4.2) \n\n \n\nwhere  is the volumetric soil moisture content measured by the capacitance sensor and SF is \n\nscaled frequency and is generated by comparing the probe response in the access tube in the soil \n\nto the probe responses in air and water (Sentek, 2001; Hossain, 2008). Coefficient A, exponent B \n\nand constant C were selected from Senetek calibration for loam soil and are equal to 0.013, 1 and \n\n0.326 respectively. \n\nVolumetric soil moisture content variations relative to a background measured in 16- Dec 2010 \n\nfor each of the tubes is illustrated at various depth levels in Figures 4.12 and 4.13. Each figure \n\nshows the volumetric soil moisture content variations in 23- Dec 2010, 7 and 28 Jan, 22-Feb and \n\n4- Mar 2011. In 16- Dec, 23- Dec 2010 and 7-Jan, 2011, data were measured in a period of \n\nintermittent moderate to heavy rainfall, while data obtained in 28-Jan and 22- Feb, 2011 were \n\nmeasured during the sporadic rainfall. Finally last dataset in 4- Mar 2011 were measured two \n\nweeks after the last rain. An investigation of the both tube access results indicates that the \n\nmoisture content decreased significantly in 4-Mar, 2011 as expected. Furthermore, each of the \n\ntube access shows visible decrease in 28-Jan and 22-Feb. No significant variations are seen in \n\n29-Dec 2010 and 7-Jan 2011. Moreover, the observed variations in the first tube access are not \n\nconsistent with the second tube access. The moisture content variations hardly exceeded 10% \n\nduring the experiment. The most remarkable moisture changes are seen in the first 50 cm of \n\ntopsoil during the data collection. To present a closer inspection of the quality of the moisture \n\ndata obtained with capacitance sensor, the weekly moisture content changes in one month from \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\neach of the access tubes were shown in Fig.4.14 and.4.15. The results were then compared to \n\nmoisture content changes inferred from resistivity models in the same place. Fig.4.16 and 4.17 \n\nwere calculated from resistivity data near the first and second access tubes respectively. Fig.4.14 \n\nand 4.15 show a very scattered and noisy moisture content variation during one month, while \n\nmoisture content changes inferred from the resistivity model show a smooth change with depth. \n\nConsidering daily rainfall data, trends observed in moisture content variations inferred from \n\nresistivity models are more consistent with our expectation. For instance, the data obtained in 14-\n\nJan, 2011 were collected 8 days after the last rainfall, while the data in 23-Dec, 2010 were \n\ncollected immediately after continuous heavy rain started in 18-Dec, 2010. Therefore the \n\nmaximum increase and decrease in moisture in shallower zone are expected in 23-Dec, 2010 and \n\n14-Jan, 2011 respectively. We also compared moisture content inferred from resistivity models \n\nwith those collected by the capacitance sensor for all other days (not shown here). We observed \n\nthat the relative moisture content data obtained by the capacitance sensor are not reliable for a \n\nquantitative investigation. More importantly, such data cannot be used as a reference to control \n\ngeophysical responses in our study. These data might be used for a qualitative comparison of \n\nmoisture content over the long time.  Therefore, we stopped measuring moisture content by the \n\ncapacitance sensor and we did not use these data in section 4.3 to convert resistivity changes to \n\nmoisture content changes. It is worth mentioning that we only used one capacitance sensor \n\nbought from Sentek Company in this experiment. Therefore to measure the moisture content \n\nalong the access tube, we manually moved the sensor inside the access tube in order to measure \n\nmoisture content in different depths. It would be one of the sourced of inaccuracy in our study. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \nFig.4.12.

Moisture content maps \n\nFig. 4-18 to 4-22 illustrate moisture content distribution computed by converting ERT images \n\nusing equation 4.1, respectively for 28-Oct and 4-Nov 2010, 11-Feb, 21-Apr, and 20- Jun 2011. \n\nMaps of moisture distribution clearly show how the moisture content of the unsaturated zone \n\nchanges during the experiment. The moisture content changed from an average of 28-32% in \n\nNovember to 22-27% in June. The right zone of the profile shows lower moisture content and \n\ngreater variation during the experiment. Moisture distribution maps obtained using Wenner and \n\nSchlumberger configurations are consistent as expected, but the estimated moisture content using \n\nDipole-Dipole is slightly lower than Wenner and Schlumberger configurations in the right side \n\nof the profile. Fig. 4.23a to Fig.4.23f show moisture distribution maps inferred from EM38 \n\nimages in 28-Oct, 4-Nov and 25-Nov 2010, 20-Jan, 11-Feb and 20- Jun 2011 respectively. An \n\ninvestigation of calculated maps in Fig. 4.23(a-f) indicates that the highest and lowest moisture \n\ncontent levels are seen in November and June respectively. The maps inferred from EM38 \n\nimages displays slightly greater moisture content and less lateral changes along the profile in \n\ncomparison with ERT images, yet the results are acceptably consistent. The spatiotemporal \n\nmoisture content changes barely exceeded 10% during the experiment which indicates that the \n\nsoil is semi-pervious and relatively homogeneous. The analysis of four soil cores taken in 2 Dec, \n\n2010, 20-Apr and 20-June 2011 for moisture content are consistent with moisture content \n\ndistribution maps inferred from EM38 and ERT images. \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n\nFig.4.18. 2D moisture content distribution in 28-Oct 2010 inferred from ERT image obtained by a) Wenner, b) \n\nSchlumberger and c) Dipole-Dipole electrode configurations using equations 4a-c. \n\n \n \n\nFig.4.19. 2D moisture content distribution in 4-Nov 2010 inferred from ERT images obtained by a) Wenner b) \n\nSchlumberger and c) Dipole-Dipole electrode configurations using equations 4a-c. \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \n\nFig.4.20. 2D moisture content distribution in 11-Feb 2011 inferred from ERT images obtained by a) Wenner, b) \n\nSchlumberger and c) Dipole-Dipole electrode configurations using equations 4a-c. \n\n \n\nFig.4.21. 2D moisture content distribution in 21-Apr 2011 inferred from ERT images obtained by a) Wenner b) \n\nSchlumberger, and c) Dipole-Dipole electrode configurations using equations 4a-c. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \n\nFig.4.22. 2D moisture content distribution in 20-Jun 2011 inferred from ERT images obtained by a) Wenner, b) \n\nSchlumberger and c) Dipole-Dipole electrode configurations using equations 4a-c. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFig.4.23. 2D moisture content distribution inferred from EM38 images by using equations 4d in a) 28-Oct, b) 4-Nov \n\nand  c) 25-Nov 2010, d) 20-Jan, e) 11-Feb and f) 20- Jun 2011. \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n4.6. Geophysical and hydrological parameters \n\nMany researchers that (e.g. Binley et al. 2002a; Looms et al. 2008a, 2008b; Dienna et al. 2007) \n\nhave shown that how geophysical monitoring could be applied for estimating hydraulic \n\nconductivity and constraining the hydrological model. EM38 images and also ERT images \n\nobtained using Wenner and Schlumberger electrode configurations were used in this study in \n\norder to estimate hydraulic conductivity.  \n \n\n4.6.1. Unsaturated flow modeling  \nUnsaturated flow model was built by a finite-element formulation using Hydrus 2D. Van \n\nGenuchten equations were applied as retention and hydraulic conductivity functions in this \n\nmodel. As mentioned in section 3.5.2, van Genuchten\u00b4s parameters (?r, ?s, ?, n, and Ks) for all \n\nsamples were estimated by Rosetta software based on the particle size distributions and bulk \n\ndensity. The ranges of van Genuchten\u00b4s parameters of soil samples are presented in table.4.1a. \n\nWe simplified the soil texture of the profile to two scenarios. A homogeneous soil was \n\nconsidered first, assuming uniform hydraulic parameters throughout the investigated area (table \n\n4.1b). Close inspection of grain size analyses from core sampling (discussed in section 4.1) and \n\nthe obtained geophysical models indicated that the subsurface may be roughly subdivided into \n\ntwo soil zones with slightly different hydraulic characteristics. Therefore we divided the soil to \n\ntwo zones, the left side from 0-7.5 m and right side from 7.5-15 m. Estimated van Genuchten\u00b4s \n\nparameters for each zone are given in table 4.1(c).Van Genuchten\u2019s equations along with \n\nestimated values were used as input for unsaturated flow simulation. Each simulation was \n\ninitiated separately by using the moisture content images inferred from ERT (Wenner and \n\nSchlumberger electrode configurations) and EM38 background images. Simulating the moisture \n\ncontent distribution, we used the same grid as the one used in EM38 and ERT inversions so as to \n\nmake it possible to compare geophysical responses with flow simulations and evaluate the \n\nhydraulic conductivity. The upper and bottom boundaries of the soil were simulated by \n\nimplementing atmospheric and free drainage boundary conditions respectively. The evaporation \n\nand precipitation data during the experiment were collected and used in these simulations. The \n\nsimulations were carried out for 238 days during 28-Oct 2010 to 20-Jun 2011 time period. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n    Table.4.1.

Estimating and constraining the hydrological parameters by geophysical data \nTo evaluate whether individual hydrologic models represent the field conditions, the geophysical \n\nresponse and simulating flow were compared using a misfit value: \n\n \n\n                                                                             (4.3) \n\n \n\nWhere is the simulated moisture content and is the moisture content inferred from ERT or \n\nEM38 images and N is the number of pixels of models. We compare the geophysical response \n\nand simulating flow based on the smallest misfit. The first ten time-lapse data sets collected by \n\nERT and EM38 were used in this evaluation. \n\nFig. 4.24, 4.26 and 4.28 presents a comparative illustration of the misfit error of simulating flow \n\nusing estimated van Genuchten\u2019s parameters for homogeneous soil (presented in table.4.1b) and \n\nERT and EM38 images. Among van Genuchten\u2019s parameters, the saturated hydraulic \n\nconductivity plays the most important role in dynamics of the vadose zone and in particular, it \n\ncontrols the speed of water infiltration (looms et al., 2008). Therefore we fixed all others \n\nGenuchten\u2019s parameters so as to make them the same as those shown in table.4.1b. Afterwards, \n\nseveral new simulations were carried out by changing saturated hydraulic conductivity values to \n\nfind the smallest misfit on the basis of the moisture content distribution. Percent of mass \n\nrecovery of ERT and EM38 images in monitoring moisture content were also calculated and \n\nplotted in Fig. 4.25, 4.27 and 4.29 in order to provide a better quantitative comparison of \n\ngeophysical model and simulating flow for hydraulic conductivity estimation. An investigation \n\nof ERT results in Fig.4.24 to Fig.4.27 shows good consistency between Wenner and \n\nSchlumberger electrode configurations results. The results of the misfit errors and present mass \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\nindicate that hydraulic conductivity value of 4.5 cm/day can reasonably reproduce the moisture \n\ncontent distribution during the experiment. Greater values of hydraulic conductivity yield higher \n\nmisfit error and underestimate mass recovery, while lower hydraulic conductivity overestimates \n\nmass recovery of the moisture content distribution and increases misfit error. The results of \n\nEM38 images are shown in Fig 4.28 and 4.29. An investigation of the misfit errors and present \n\nmass indicate that the hydraulic conductivity of 8 cm/day can better reproduce the moisture \n\ncontent distribution during the experiment. Lower hydraulic conductivities largely overestimate \n\nmass recovery and show greater misfit errors. On the other hand, greater hydraulic conductivities \n\nunderestimate mass recovery and also yield greater misfit errors. Hydraulic conductivity \n\nestimated using EM38 images is two times greater than that estimated by ERT images, yet all \n\nresults constrained hydraulic conductibility to be in 1-10 cm/day range. We also calculated the \n\nmisfit error and mass recovery of ERT images in comparison with simulating flow using 2-layers \n\nsoil and estimated van Genuchten\u2019s parameters in table 4.1c. The misfit error and mass recovery \n\nof ERT images in comparison with simulating model are shown in Fig 4.30 and 4.31 with ? =1. \n\nWe only presented ERT images inferred from Schlumberger electrode configuration since the \n\nresults of ERT images inferred from Wenner electrode configuration are very similar. Several \n\nnew simulations were carried out using multiple values for hydraulic conductivity reported in \n\nTable 4.1c. The goal was to find the smallest misfit and best mass recovery. Results indicate that \n\nsmallest misfit and best mass recovery are achieved by a 2-layer model with hydraulic \n\nconductivity of 4 and 5.3 cm/day among our flow simulations. Comparing misfit error obtained \n\nusing ERT images; we found that 2-layers soil (Fig 4.32b) reproduced moisture content \n\ndistribution slightly better than homogenous soil (Fig 4.32a) did. We also analyzed different \n\nscenarios for 2 layers soil such as greater hydraulic conductivity for the left zone rather than the \n\nright zone or greater differences between the hydraulic conductivity of the left and right zone \n\n(e.g. see Fig. 4.32c, d). Our investigation indicates that the hydraulic conductivity of soil slightly \n\nincreases along the profile from the left to the right side. We did the same procedure for EM38 \n\nimages to see whether yield better fit with 2-layer soil model. Different from ERT images, EM38 \n\nimages did not better match to 2-layer soil model.  \n\nIn Fig.4.33 and Fig.4.34, the moisture-content simulations in 4-Nov 2010, 11-Feb, 21-Apr and \n\n20- Jun 2011 were presented so as to better visualize moisture-content distribution. A \n\nhomogenous and a 2-layer soil with Van Genuchten parameters defined in table.4.1b and 4.1c \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nwere used to produce Fig.4.33 and Fig.4.34 respectively. The goal was to helps compare \n\nmoisture-content distribution inferred from ERT images with flow simulations that shows the \n\nmost similarity among simulations.  \n\nAn investigation of Fig.4.33 and Fig.4.34 in comparison with Fig.4.18 to Fig.4.22 show an \n\nacceptable estimation of moisture content values along the profile during the period of the \n\nexperiment. This finding indicated that the estimated hydraulic conductivity acceptably \n\nreproduce the water movement. The moisture content distribution maps inferred from ERT \n\nimages are to some extent different from flow simulations shown in Fig.4.33 and Fig.4.34. This \n\nis not surprising because our simulations limited to only homogenous and 2-layer soil scenarios \n\nwhile a significant degree of heterogeneity had been observed in the soil texture analysis. This \n\ndisparity is not the only source of disagreement of flow simulations and ERT images, the lateral \n\nwater movement, the inversion process of ERT data and the noise level in the ERT images \n\n(particularly in background ERT image) might explain this level of discrepancy. Yet, the flow \n\nsimulations using 2-layer soil with higher hydraulic conductivity in right side of the profile better \n\nmatches with ERT images. \n\nIn Fig.4.35, moisture-content simulations in 4-Nov and 25-Nov 2010, 20-Jan, 11-Feb and 20- \n\nJun 2011 were presented. A homogenous soil with Van Genuchten parameters defined in \n\ntable.4.1b and hydraulic conductivity of 8 cm/min was selected in order to compare the results \n\nwith EM38 images. A comparison of Fig. 4.35 with Fig.4.23 indicate that the water movement is \n\nwell reproduced using a saturated hydraulic conductivity equal to 8 cm/min, but the moisture \n\ncontent distribution inferred from EM38 images is relatively different from flow simulations due \n\nto the above-mentioned reasons discussed for ERT images. In addition, lower inherent accuracy \n\nof EM38 in comparison with ERT surveys and the absences of time-lapse inversion process for \n\nEM38 data contributed to creation of the discrepancy mentioned in these comparisons. \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \nFig.4.24.

Water Injection Test \n\nA small circular hole with total volume of 2512 cm3 was drilled to conduct an artificial water \n\ninjection test. The hole was filled by tap water with electrical conductivity of 110 ms/m once per \n\nday. The evolution of the injected water was monitored by symmetrical ERT surveys using a \n\npole-pole array in four directions in order to monitor lateral water movement. A total of 80 \n\nelectrodes were installed and connected to 80 active boxes to monitor water movement in four \n\ndirections. The expansion of each profile was the same and equal to 6.05m. 20 electrodes with \n\nthe electrode positions of X= 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.15, 3.25, 3.35, 3.45, 3.55, \n\n3.80, 4.05, 4.55, 5.05 and 6.05m were used in each profile. The borehole was located in the \n\nmiddle of the all four profiles in X=3-3.05m. Smaller electrode separations were selected near \n\nborehole (10 cm) for a higher resolution near the borehole and were subsequently increased to \n\n25, 50 and finally 100 cm at the both sides of the profile. A total of 190 measurements were \n\ntaken for each image. The total time required for each acquisition was about 15 minutes. \n\nERT data was collected in each profile twice per day for a week starting in 21-Sep 2011. Data \n\ncollection was done in early morning immediately after water injection and in the afternoon, \n\nwhen the borehole was almost empty of water. We collected two backgrounds for each profile, \n\none with empty borehole and one immediately after filling the borehole for the first time. \n\nConsidering similarities between profiles, we only show and discuss the results of the first \n\nprofile. The background model (collected with filled borehole) is shown in Fig.4.36. The \n\nmodeling result shows relatively high resistivity values (higher than 150 ?.m) in very shallow \n\nzone (less than 30 cm) and low resistivity with average value of 20 ?.m in deeper zone along the \n\nprofile. \n\nThe inversion of the time-lapse ERT data was carried out using RES2DINVx32 ver. 3.71. To \n\nbetter present resistivity changes near the borehole, we only used the data in the range of x=2.5-\n\n3.5 meter with the maximum depth of 1.5m for time-lapse inversion process. Fig. 4.37 shows the \n\nresults of the resistivity inversions for the first profile with data collected immediately after \n\nfilling the borehole, in terms of percentage resistivity changes with regard to background.  \n\n Fig.4.37 shows the resistivity decrease around the borehole over the period of time to some \n\nextent. Unfortunately, we were not able to draw out a quantitative model of resistivity changes in \n\norder to trace the water movement. A number of factors resulted in this undesired outcome for \n\nthe experiment:  \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\n1- The volume of borehole and consequently the amount of injected water were not enough \n\nto trace the water movement. \n\n2- The electrical conductivity of the injected water (110 ms/m) was not significantly greater \n\nthan the average electrical conductivity of the soil (50 ms/m) to trace the water movement \n\nbased on the electrical conductivity contrast. Of course, applying a saline tracer could \n\naim at monitoring water movement more effectively, but it might distort the field site for \n\nfurther investigation under the natural condition. \n\n3- The high level of moisture content before the water injection test was the main reason of \n\nthe low electrical conductivity of soil. Although the experiment was conducted in driest \n\nperiod of the year, the soil was still too wet for such experiment. \n\n4- We should have designed and installed a device to refill the borehole automatically to \n\nkeep the injected water in the ground level. The present of air gap (as a high resistivity \n\nanomaly) distorted ERT images near the borehole considerably.  \n\n5- The electrical conductivity of the most important zone of the experiment (x=2.5-3.5m and \n\nz=0-20cm) in four directions were dramatically influenced by electrical conductivity of \n\n40 electrodes connected to the ground. The observed data in this zone was noisy and the \n\nobtained model was also very unstable in inversion process. \n\n6- Due to lack of security, it was impossible to leave the equipment in the field to collect \n\ndense dataset for a better monitoring of resistivity changes. \n\n7- The period of ERT monitoring was not long enough to trace water movement. In fact we \n\nhad overestimated the hydraulic conductivity when designed the experiment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFig.4.36\n\ninjection test.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6. 2D vertical resistivity models of ERT background using \n\ninjection test. \n\n. 2D vertical resistivity models of ERT background using . 2D vertical resistivity models of ERT background using . 2D vertical resistivity models of ERT background using \n\n81\n\n. 2D vertical resistivity models of ERT background using \n\n81 \n\n. 2D vertical resistivity models of ERT background using . 2D vertical resistivity models of ERT background using pole-polepole electrode configurationselectrode configurationselectrode configurations for water \n \n\nfor water \n\n\n\n \n\na) \n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd) \n\ne)\n\nf)\n\nFig.4.37\n\nconfiguration with respect to background in\n\n7.

Both EM38 and ground surface ERT methods were capable of imaging changes in bulk \n\nresistivity in order to map seasonal moisture content distribution. The study of soil \n\nindicated that the soil moisture content hardly fall below 20% in dry season. We only \n\nobserved lower values of moisture content in very shallow zone in summer. In contrast, \n\nthe soil moisture content reached 30% during the rain period.  \n\n \n\n2. The experiment conducted at the campus of university of Lisbon proves that the soil is \n\nsemi-pervious sediment. The spatiotemporal moisture content change during the \n\nexperiment barely exceeds 10%. Our calculations using ERT and EM38 images constrain \n\nthe range of the saturated hydraulic conductivity to be in 1-10 (cm/day). The low contrast \n\nof the electrical conductivity between the excess moisture content and soil and also \n\ninsufficient temporal variation changes under natural condition in this study added to the \n\ncomplication of using the ground surface ERT and EM38 to present an accurate \n\nquantitative model in order to estimate hydraulic conductivity. Constraining and \n\nestimating of hydraulic variables in unsaturated soil usually requires very dense \n\nmonitoring of geophysical data under a designed-infiltration. In addition, a tracer with \n\nlarge electrical conductivity contrast might be needed to better visualize how tracer sinks.  \n\n \n\n3. Based on comparison of outcomes obtained using EM38 and those from ERT, EM38 \n\nproved to be acceptably capable in monitoring moisture content changes and water \n\nmovement in shallow zone. EM38 has the advantage of being less expensive, much \n\nfaster, and easier to use in data collection in comparison with the ERT method. \n\nFurthermore, EM38can cover a larger area in regional investigation. Paying special \n\nattention to both data collection and inversion is greatly important in order to achieve a \n\nquantitative model.    \n\n \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n4. A careful consideration of inverse problem should be taken into account to avoid the \n\neffects of overparameterization and smoothing from regularization that can impact the \n\nquantitative estimates of hydrogeologic parameter values using geophysical data. Several \n\ntime-lapse inversion algorithms were developed in geoelectrical modeling in order to \n\nobtain a quantitative model of subsurface. In this study, the method proposed by Kim \n\n(2009) was used to invert ERT data. This method introduces the regularizations not only \n\nin the space domain but also in time to reduce inversion artifacts and improve stability of \n\nthe inverse problem even if changes in the subsurface properties during the data \n\nacquisition cannot be ignored. Different methods mentioned in section 3.3 were used and \n\ncompared (not shown here) in this research and we found that the space-time \n\nparameterization method yields better results and is more user-friendly among those \n\nmethods.  \n\n \n\n5. Applying the established in-situ relationship for conversion of electrical conductivity to \n\nmoisture content has the advantage of using an approach same as ERT and EM38 images \n\nto calibrate field data which aims to reduce heterogeneity in moisture content distribution \n\nmapping. In contrast, the degree of saturation of extracted sample was limited and did not \n\ncover 0-1 range which made impossible to achieve a more accurate relationship. \n\nMoreover, localizing and estimating of the electrical conductivity of the related samples \n\nbased on the obtained inverted model is another source of uncertainty in an established \n\nin-situ relationship. Using Archie\u2019s law instead of the established in-situ relationship for \n\nconversion of the electrical conductivity to moisture content would considerably \n\noverestimate moisture content estimation in this study. \n\n \n\n6. In spite of the reported poor resolution of ERT images in mass recovery in many \n\npublications, the obtained results in this study shows a very good mass recovery at \n\nsimulating the moisture excess with respect to background. This is probably because of \n\nusing in-situ resistivity-saturation relationship which reduces the disagreement. In \n\naddition, the low degree of moisture content variations made the mass recovery \n\ncalculation more realistic.  \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n7. Neglecting temporal fluctuations in temperature when using electrical conductivity \n\nimages to monitor the moisture content distribution leads to errors when a quantitative \n\nestimate of moisture content is required. Many studies have tried to convert ERT images \n\nto moisture content maps however, if this is to be meaningful, then temperature variations \n\nwithin the image must be accounted for (Hayley et al. 2007).  The temperature data \n\nshows 12\u00b0c variations during the experiment. Such a variation significantly affects ERT \n\nand EM38 images and is required to be modified for a quantitative model.  \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUsing EM38 and ERT methods in soil \n\ncharacterization at the Campanhia das Lezirias \u2013 \n\nSamorra Correia \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n5. Study of EM38 and ERT methods at the Campanhia das Lezirias \u2013 Samorra Correia \n\nInvestigation of the EM38 and ERT methods in monitoring moisture content changes and \n\nhydraulic conductivity estimation on a deep Arenosol soil with high permeability and a low \n\nwater retention capacity was conducted in the Campanhia das Lezirias \u2013 Samorra Correia under \n\nnatural condition and forced-infiltration experiment. This chapter investigates the result of the \n\nEM38 and ERT surveys in soil moisture content monitoring and hydraulic conductivity \n\nestimation. A synthetic test was also performed in order to identify errors associated with the \n\nERT method and inversion process. \n\n \n\n5.1. Field Site Selection \n\nTo select a new suitable field site for the study, several 2D ground surface ERT surveys were \n\ncarried out. The goal was to find a fairly homogeneous soil, based on resistivity changes along \n\nthe profiles. Among several ERT images obtained in Samora- Correia, the ERT model shown in \n\nFig.5.1 shows the minimum lateral changes. An investigation of this model indicates a very \n\nresistive topsoil in the first two meter with smooth lateral resistivity variations along the profile \n\nparticularly between x=7.5m and x=27.5m (marked by red rectangular). Decrease of resistivity \n\nby depth is clearly visible in this model where it falls below 10 ?.m in the deeper zone. The \n\nsharp decrease of resistivity is related to groundwater level in field area. We repeated ERT \n\nsurvey in the same profile between x=7.5m and x=27.5m where shows the minimum lateral \n\nchanges (Fig.5.2) to more accurately investigate the lateral resistivity changes. Two soil cores \n\nwere taken to a depth of approximately 2m to analyze particle size distribution. We found \n\nsupportive evidence that the selected profile shown in Fig.5.2 is suitable to conduct our study in \n\nthis zone. Therefore further investigation was carried out in this profile.  \n\n\n\n \n\nFig.5.1. \n\ncurrent electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\nFig.5.2. \n\nelectrode configuration with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\nm. \n\nFig.5.1. 2D vertical resistivity image of \n\ncurrent electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\n. 2D vertical resistivity image of \n\nelectrode configuration with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\n2D vertical resistivity image of \n\ncurrent electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\n2D vertical resistivity image of \n\nelectrode configuration with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\n2D vertical resistivity image of \n\ncurrent electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\n2D vertical resistivity image of \n\nelectrode configuration with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\n2D vertical resistivity image of selected profile \n\ncurrent electrode (AB/2) expansion of 25 m and electrode spacing of 2.5 m.\n\n2D vertical resistivity image of the selected zone of\n\nelectrode configuration with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\n88\n\nselected profile using Schlumberger electrode configuration with maximum \n\nand electrode spacing of 2.5 m.\n\nselected zone of\n\nelectrode configuration with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\n88 \n\nusing Schlumberger electrode configuration with maximum \n\nand electrode spacing of 2.5 m.\n\nselected zone of the profile shown in Fig. 5.\n\nelectrode configuration with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of \n\nusing Schlumberger electrode configuration with maximum \n\nand electrode spacing of 2.5 m. \n\nprofile shown in Fig. 5.\n\nelectrode configuration with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of 12.5\n\nusing Schlumberger electrode configuration with maximum \n\nprofile shown in Fig. 5.\n\n12.5 m and electrode spacing of \n\nusing Schlumberger electrode configuration with maximum \n\nprofile shown in Fig. 5.1 using Schlumberger \n\nm and electrode spacing of \n\nusing Schlumberger electrode configuration with maximum \n\nusing Schlumberger \n\nm and electrode spacing of \n\n \nusing Schlumberger electrode configuration with maximum \n\nusing Schlumberger \n\nm and electrode spacing of 1.25 \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n5.2. Soil Test \n\nA total of eight soil cores down to a depth of approximately 1.8-2.5 m were extracted along the \n\nprofile since 17th Oct 2011 until 16th Oct 2012 (Fig.5.3). These cores were sectioned into 0.2 m \n\nlengths (Fig.5.4) and prepared for laboratory analysis of soil physical properties namely particle \n\ndensity, bulk density, texture and gravimetric water content. The particle size distribution \n\nanalyses of two cores along the profile were shown in Fig.5.5 and Fig.5.6. The particle size \n\ndistribution analysis indicated a sand texture class with less than five percent clay and silt, on \n\naverage. The observed average particle density and bulk density were 2.65 and 1.66 respectively \n\nand the porosity value was equal to 37%. As the average particle density and bulk density \n\nexhibited a low degree of variation along the field site, the site was considered homogeneous and \n\nthe porosity was fixed at 37%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \nFig.5.3.

Geophysical monitoring \n\nThe evolution of the moisture content distribution was monitored by the ground surface ERT \n\nsurveys since 17th Oct 2011 until 16th Oct 2012 under the natural conditions (Fig.5.7). \n\nGeophysical surveys were repeated monthly. The possibility of using EM38 and borehole ERT \n\nwere also examined in this study. \n\n \n\n \nFig.5.7.

Geoeletrical monitoring  \n2D ground surface ERT survey was performed using Schlumberger electrode configurations and \n\nusing 4 point light 10W devise with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of 10 m and \n\nelectrode spacing of 0.5 m (40 electrodes). A total of 361 measurements were done for each \n\ndataset. All data were inverted using RES2DINV with two iterations. Effect of change in \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\ntemperature with respect to background dataset was removed from all ERT data by applying a \n\nvalue of 2% change per degree before inversion. The models obtained from inversion of data \n\ncollected in Dec-2011, Jan, March, May, Jun and Aug-2012 were shown in Fig.5.8a to Fig.8f \n\nrespectively. The inversion images obtained during the experiment period show very resistive \n\ntopsoil in the first 2 meters followed by a sharp fall in resistivity in deeper zone. This pattern of \n\nchange in resistivity is attributed to the groundwater level and sharp moisture content variations \n\nin the transition zone. Comparisons of the successive models clearly show a fall in groundwater \n\nlevel during the Dec, 2011-Aug, 2012 time period. The highest level of the groundwater is seen \n\nin Dec-2011, while lowest groundwater level is seen in Aug-2012. The unsaturated zone shows a \n\nsmooth resistivity change during the experiment. The analysis of soil samples collected during \n\nthe experiment indicates that the groundwater level varies in 2.6-3.6 meter range. The highest \n\ngroundwater level was 2.6 meter seen in Dec-2011 and the lowest was slightly deeper than 3.6 \n\nmeters seen in Aug-2012. Relative seasonal groundwater level changes inferred from ERT \n\nimages are acceptably consistent with sampling results. Nevertheless ERT images overestimated \n\nthe width of the transition zone and consequently overestimated the groundwater level.      \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ne)\n\nf)\n\nFig.5.8. . 2D vertical resistivity image2D vertical resistivity image2D vertical resistivity images in a)in a) Dec-2011, b) Jan, c) March, d)\n\n94\n\n2011, b) Jan, c) March, d)\n\n94 \n\n2011, b) Jan, c) March, d)2011, b) Jan, c) March, d) May, e) Jun, e) Jun and and f) Aug 2012. ) Aug 2012.   \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n5.3.2.  In-situ resistivity and saturation relationship \nTo determine changes in soil moisture from ERT images, we did not again assume the validity of \n\nArchie\u2019s law in this study. We repeated the same procedure explained in 4.3 and established an \n\nin-situ approach based on ? vs. S changes. The obtained relationship (Fig.5.9) is given by the \n\nfollowing equation:  \n\n?                                                                                                                      (5.1) \n\nWhere S is the degree of saturation and ? is the resistivity of the porous medium in relevant \n\ndegree of saturation. Equation (5.1) was used to convert resistivity changes to moisture content \n\nchanges.\n\n \n\nFig. 5.9. Electrical resistivity of extracted samples as a function of the saturation \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Moisture content maps \nFig.5.10 shows the moisture content distribution map in 17-Jan 2012 inferred from ERT images \n\nby using equation (5.1). This dataset was collected with 1 day delay after about 10mm rainfall. \n\nAn investigation of this maps show a dry unsaturated zone in the first 2 meter with less than 8% \n\nmoisture content. In deeper zone, a very sharp moisture content rise from 8% to more than 25% \n\ny = 39.60x-2.36\nR\u00b2 = 0.955\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n\n?\n(?\n\n.m\n)\n\nS\n\n\n\n96 \n \n\nis seen. This rise is related to the groundwater influence in this zone. The data collected in 17-Jan \n\n2012, was selected as background for time-lapse inversion since the dataset collected in Dec-\n\n2011 was very noisy and unsuitable to be used as background. Fig.5.11 (a-f) show the inversion \n\nresults, in terms of percentage desaturation which obtained from converting differences of ERT \n\nimages with regard to background by using equation (5.1). An investigation of Fig.5.11 reveals \n\nthe influence of the seasonal groundwater level fall in ERT images in deeper zone. ERT image \n\nobtained in Aug (Fig.5.11f) shows the maximum level of desaturation with more than 25% with \n\nrespect to background in depths that are over 2 m. The moisture content changes in this zone are \n\nmainly influenced by seasonal rainfall. In contrary, the resistivity changes and consequently the \n\nmoisture content variations in unsaturated zone (less than 1.5-2m) are mainly influenced by daily \n\nrainfall due to the fast infiltration in high-permeability sediments. Unfortunately the monthly \n\nERT images could not aim at monitoring the water movement in unsaturated zone in order to \n\nestimate and constrain hydrologic parameters. We also examined whether we could map \n\nmoisture changes under natural condition with daily ERT monitoring. For instance, ERT images \n\nshown in Fig.5.11 (b, c and d) were modeled by inverting data collected in 6, 7 and 8-Apr 2012 \n\nafter the rainfall. Our investigations indicated that the very fast water movement in the \n\nunsaturated zone makes ERT images application complicated under the natural condition. \n\nImaging water movement in high-permeability sediments under natural conditions requires a \n\nvery dense data set collection during and after a heavy rain. Since the field site was not in Lisbon \n\nand arrangements were required to book a car and access to the field site, it was not possible to \n\nfind access to the field site at the right time. Neither was it possible to leave the monitoring \n\nequipment at the site, mainly due to security reasons. Therefore we designed a forced infiltration \n\nexperiment for soil characterization. The details of the forced infiltration experiment will be \n\nshown and discussed in section 5.4. \n\n \n\nFig.5.10. 2D moisture content distribution in 17-Jan, 2012 inferred from ERT images. \n\n\n\n \n\na) \n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ne)\n\nf)\n\nFig.5.11\n\nMar, b)\n\n1.

Borehole ERT \nResolution of ground surface ERT imaging decreases with depth. Cross borehole ERT usually \n\nprovides a more uniform vertical model resolution particularly when detailed information and \n\nquantitative model are required. Electrodes are usually installed in four or more boreholes to \n\nmonitor 3d spatial resistivity image. Also, it is possible to use mixed surface and borehole \n\nelectrodes for better resolution as long as all electrodes are in the same plane. In this study we \n\ntried to use borehole ERT in order to collect more accurate data to achieve a better quantitative \n\nmodel for hydraulic conductivity estimation. \n\n \n\n5.3.4.1. Borehole ERT devise   \n\nWe built a borehole tool in the lab and used 4 point light 10W devise and active boxes to monitor \n\nresistivity images in the field. 18 stainless steel nails were used as electrodes. They were \n\nsoldered to cables then taped to a PVC pipe every 10 cm (Fig.5.12a). The tube was then installed \n\nin an augured hole (Fig.5.12b). To ensure a good contact between the electrode and the \n\nsurrounding material, we filled the hole using dried sand by using a funnel and a long tube. In \n\nthat way we could ensure that the dry sand was filled from the bottom and did not create cavities. \n\nWe also shacked the PVC tube with the electrodes while backfilling to ensure a good packing. \n\nTo survey mixed surface and borehole ERT, we firstly connected all 18 cables (electrode) to the \n\nactive boxes (Fig.5.12c) and checked the contact resistance. Unfortunately, despite all efforts \n\nmade on this device, the contact resistance of the electrodes connection was not good enough for \n\nborehole resistivity images. The dryness of the soil as well as the loose packing of sand grains in \n\nthe field were the most important reasons that resulted in a less than satisfactory outcome.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\n \n\n   \n\nFig.5.12. a) Borehole ERT tool made in Laboratory. b) Tool installment in the field c) Electrode connection to active \n\nboxes. \n\n \n\n5.3.5. The EM38 \nEM38 measurements were made in the vertical (EM38v) and horizontal (EM38h) modes of \n\noperation with 0.5m separation along the profile and consequently 40 points were measured in \n\neach survey. To facilitate multi-height EM38 measurement, the ladder was again used and EM38 \n\nmeasurements were also collected in both vertical and horizontal in 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 m heights. \n\nThe ECa data collected in Dec-2011 is shown in Fig.5.13. The data indicate very low electrical \n\nconductivity (less than 10 ms/m) in both vertical and horizontal modes and all four heights. \n\nThese values indicated a very dry soil along the profile as expected.  \n\nJoint inversion of multi-height EM38 measurements was carried out using the algorithm \n\nproposed by Santos, (2004). The data of each survey were inverted considering initial five- layer \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\nearth model. The first four layers were initialized with the same depth of 0.3m and electrical \n\nconductivity of 2, 3, 4 and 5 mS/m respectively from the ground surface. The electrical \n\nconductivity of the last layer was selected to be 7 mS/m. These values were estimated based on \n\nthe resistivity model obtained in previous section and also data shown in Fig.5.13. The inverted \n\nmodels of the EM38 data are presented in Fig.5.14a. The model was obtained using all 8 dataset \n\nshown in Fig.5.13 by applying the 1-D laterally constrained inversion and using damping factor \n\nof ? = 3 and 15 iterations. The inverted model indicates high resistivity topsoil along the profile \n\nin the first 0.5 m followed by a sharp vertical resistivity fall with depth increment. The total \n\nmisfit error of the model is about 21%. We changed the electrical conductivity of layers in initial \n\nmodel and also damping factor frequently to see whether it can improves the misfit error. We \n\ncould not achieve significant improvement in inversion process and there was a clear \n\ndisagreement in models in comparison with ERT images and soil samples moisture content. \n\nAgain we changed the initial models, but this time by increasing the depth of investigation to 2.8 \n\nm (the underground water level). The reasons for increasing of depth of investigation to be more \n\nthan 1.5 m were that the average of the electrical conductivity collected in vertical mode on the \n\nground and 0.3 m height was about 8ms/s which is considerably greater than the expected \n\nelectrical conductivity of the first 1.5 m with a very dry soil. Therefore, the influence of \n\ntransition zone and groundwater on data was obvious to us and of course is not unexpected a \n\ndeeper penetration of electromagnetic induction where the subsoil is not conductive. The \n\ninverted model was obtained using a damping factor of 3, 15 iterations and a 5 layers initial \n\nmodels with depth of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.8 and electrical conductivity of 2, 4, 6 and 15 ms/m \n\nrespectively. The electrical conductivity of the last layer (deeper than 2.8 m) was selected to be \n\n50 ms/m. The new model contains considerably less total misfit error (about 13%). An \n\ninvestigation of the obtained image (shown in Fig.5.14b) is in a fairly good agreement with ERT \n\nimage in Fig 5.8a. We repeated EM38 data collection in Jan and Feb, 2012 and we made the \n\nsame procedure of data modeling (not shown here). Our investigation show that EM38 cannot \n\neffectively aims at monitoring resistivity changes in unsaturated sandy soil under natural \n\nconditions to present a quantitative model in order to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity \n\nand we stopped collecting EM38 data because:  \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n1- As was mentioned in section 5.3.3, imaging water movement in high-permeability \n\nsediments under natural conditions requires a dense data set collection during and after a \n\nheavy rain when a significant moisture changes are expected which was not possible to \n\nachieve it. \n\n2- A very dry unsaturated soil is not an ideal media for EM38 investigation when a \n\nquantitative and temporal study is required. Low values of electrical conductivity (less \n\nthan 9 ms/m) are very sensitive to noise. The main effective noise source is setting and \n\nmaintaining EM38 in Zero. It is necessary that this Zero be accurately achieved and \n\nobtained. Such an error would be negligible over the usual range of conductive soils, but \n\nit was significant in our study.  \n\n3- The great contrast of the electrical conductivity of groundwater has strong influence in \n\nEM38 images in the unsaturated zone with very dry sandy soil which make it \n\ncomplicated to draw out lateral and vertical moisture variation in unsaturated zone.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\n \nFig.5.13.

Water injection test  \nAn artificial water-injection experiment was carried out at a rate of 8.96 cm/h over a 12.6 by 2.1 \n\nm2 area of the field site, using drippers spaced every 30 cm over the surface (294 drippers) for \n\nabout 3 hours (Fig. 5.15a). Therefore, about 0.71 m3 of water was injected during the \n\nexperiment. The pressure compensating drippers with drip rate of 8 liters per hour (Fig. 5.15b) \n\nwere used for all 294 drippers in this experiment to guarantees uniform water distribution along \n\nthe entire lines. The water supplied from a nearby groundwater access to a water tank (Fig. \n\n5.15c) and was distributed to the drippers by using a pump to ensure constant flow during the \n\nexperiment. A water flow meter was connected to the system to verify a constant flow rate of \n\nwater and also measured the final amount of injected water.  \n\n                        a) \n\n \n\n                         \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\nb) \n\n \n\nc) \n\n \n\nFig.5.15a) a view of artificial water-injection experiment over a 12.6 by 2.1 m2 area and ERT monitoring, b) A \n\nsample of the pressure compensating drippers with drip rate of 8 liters per hour (294 drippers in this experiment was \n\nused to guarantees uniform water distribution along the entire lines), c) A view of water tanker and the electric \n\ngenerator in this experiment.  \n\n \n\n5.4.1. Temperature Sensor installation \n14 soil temperature sensors were installed in 2 boreholes at depths of 0.1 m, 0.3 m, 0.5 m, 0.7 m, \n\n0.9, 1.1 and 1.3 m. The sensors monitored temperature changes minutely during the experiment. \n\nFig.5.16 illustrates changes in temperature of the first borehole during injection of water at the \n\nexperiment. The temperature graphs for sensors in depths over 30 cm in Fig.5.16b show that the \n\ntemperature decreased sharply at the beginning of the water injection and followed by a gradual \n\nrise as water injection went on. Sensors with less than 30 cm but more than 10 cm show \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\nincreasing trends during the water injection.

Geophysical monitoring \nThe evolution of the injected water was monitored by ERT surveys. A 2D ground surface ERT \n\nsurvey using Schlumberger electrode configuration, with maximum current electrode (AB/2) \n\nexpansion of 5.85m and electrode spacing of 0.30 m was performed on this experiment.  A total \n\nof 361 measurements were taken for each image. The total time required for each acquisition was \n\nabout 22 minutes and 149 data sets were obtained during the water-injection and also three data \n\nsets were collected before the experiment to use as a background ERT image. The water \n\ninjection test was started at 10h30 in 16-Oct, 2012. ERT surveys were started by water injection \n\nand continued until 20-Oct, 2012. Smaller electrode separation was used in this experiment in \n\ncomparison with the previous section to allow a more detailed and dense lateral vertical data \n\ncollection in first 1.5 meter. It aims to better visualize and monitor resistivity changes in \n\nunsaturated zone and also eliminate the groundwater influence in ERT images for a better focus \n\non the unsaturated zone. The simpler bottom boundary conditions for flow simulations is also \n\nexpected when the simulations are carried out in unsaturated zone far from the groundwater, \n\notherwise the details information from the groundwater level variation is required for an \n\nacceptable flow simulation.    \n\nAll 3 background ERT data sets were inverted and the more stable and less noisy model was \n\nselected for further investigation in time-lapse inversion. The background model is shown in \n\nFig.5.17. The modeling result shows a resistive media along the profile which indicate the soil \n\nwas very dry before the water-injection (as discussed in section 5.3.1.). \n\n Fig.5.18 show the results of the resistivity inversions, in terms of percentage water content \n\nchanges which obtained from converting differences of ERT images with regard to background \n\nby using equation (5.1). We presented all ERT images collected during the water injection \n\n(Fig.5.18a to Fig.5.18h) until 2 hours after the water injection (Fig.5.18i to Fig5.18m) and some \n\nselected images from 17-Oct (the day after water injection) at 00h30, 4h50 and 18h40 in Fig.5.18 \n\n(n, o and p), at 18h00 from 18-Oct in Fig.5.18 (q), at 17h20 from 19-Oct in Fig.5.18(r) and \n\n18h12 from 20-Oct in Fig.5.18 (s). Two iterations were only used to invert all data in this study \n\nsince the greater number of iterations caused misleading anomalies in some time-lapse images.   \n\nFig.5.18 (a-h) shows clearly the infiltrating water front into the unsaturated zone shortly after the \n\ninjection.

Moment Analysis \n \n\n2D spatial moments were calculated from the resistivity images according to the description of \n\nmoment analysis discussed in 3.6. We only used the first 8 ERT images which were collected \n\nduring the water injection. We also used the inverted resistivity data in x=2.5-9.5m range in this \n\ncalculation to avoid the extrapolation effect of the ERT inversion model in moment analysis. \n\nThe results of these analyses are plotted in Fig.5.19 (a-c). The percent mass calculated using \n\nequation (3.48) after removing the mass from the background (Fig.5.19a) shows a poor \n\nresolution at simulating the amount of injected water. The mass error is fairly steady over the \n\nexperiment with a gradual decrease from 23% to 19.5%. As pointed out by many authors (see \n\ne.g. Looms et al., 2008; Binley et al., 2002b; Singha and Gorelick, 2005) the poor sensitivity of \n\nERT method (particularly ground surface ERT) in imaging water content amount might be \n\nexplained by the lateral water movement out of the measurement area in 2D survey, the inversion \n\nprocess, the noise level in the background resistivity image and the use of inadequate \n\npetrophysical relationships. Although, we used in-situ resistivity and saturation relationship to \n\nreduce this disagreement; however, the methods still suffers from the mass error balance.  \n\nTo estimate the centre-of-mass vertical motion, the first moment, M01 was calculated using \n\n(3.48) and then normalized by the mass of the system. The centre-of-mass vertical motion is \n\nshown in Fig.5.19b. The ERT-estimated of centre-of-mass vertical motion indicates clearly the \n\nvery fast infiltration and vertical downward migration. The centre of mass moved approximately \n\n55 cm from the injection source over 180 minutes. The centre of mass is in preference to other \n\nmeasures, such as the position of the tracer front, because (a) it has a physical basis, and (b) will \n\nbe sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity of the sandstone for gravity dominated flow. The \n\nvertical spread of water tracer was also calculated by using equation (3.49) and plotted in \n\nFig.5.19c. The graph shows a fairly monotonic trend of increasing in the vertical spread over the \n\nexperiment as water migrates downward. The vertical spread of the excess water content show a \n\ngreater scatter comparing the first moment. It is not unexpected due to the high sensitivity of the \n\nsecond moment computation to noisy data sets and smoothness optimization method used in \n\ninversion process. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n112 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.5.19.

Unsaturated flow modeling  \nUnsaturated flow models were built using finite-element formulation. Hydrus 2D was used to \n\nsimulate unsaturated flow. Van Genuchten equations were applied as retention and hydraulic \n\nconductivity functions in this model. Two different methods were used in this study to estimate \n\nall five van Genuchten parameters. At first, these parameters were estimated by Rosetta software \n\nbased on the particle size distributions and bulk density. The obtained values are given in table \n\n5.1(a).  \n\nIn addition, to estimate van Genuchten\u2019s parameters we used a mini disk infiltrometer in ten \n\npoints along the profile. At each point, the same consecutive tensions at -6, -4 and -2 were \n\napplied to the soil. One sample from each point was also taken before the experiment to measure \n\nthe initial water content in lab. Due to the very fast infiltration of sandy soil, it was impossible to \n\ntake a sample to measure final water content. Therefore we fixed the saturated water content to \n\nbe 0.37 to constrain the retention curve during the optimization. The cumulative infiltrations for \n\ntwo examples of mini disk infiltrometer data sets were plotted in Fig.5.20 as a function of time. \n\nThese data were used as input for DISK software to estimate van Genuchten\u2019s parameters. The \n\nobtained values in the inversion process are shown in table 5.1(b and c) for the first and second \n\ncumulative infiltrations shown in Fig.5.20. The minimum and maximum estimated hydraulic \n\nconductivity using mini disk infltrometer data along the profile were 0.01, 0.12 cm/min \n\nrespectively. Afterward, van Genuchten\u2019s equations with the estimated values in table 5.1 were \n\nused as input to the unsaturated flow simulation. Initial conditions were developed based on the \n\nwater content of samples which were taken just before the water injection. Regarding all above-\n\nmentioned evidences, a homogenous soil was selected for simulations. The bottom boundary of \n\nthe soil column was simulated by implementing a free drainage boundary condition. The \n\nsimulations were carried out for 180 minutes and the evaporation was neglected in all \n\nsimulations. Three simulations were obtained using van Genuchten\u2019s parameters estimations \n\nshown in table 5.1. The first, second and third simulation shown in Fig.5.21 present the \n\ncalculated centre-of-mass vertical motion of the simulating flow based on van Genuchten\u2019s \n\nparameters in table 5.1a, b and c respectively. The simulations derived from the cumulative \n\ninfiltrations, show a much slower infiltration in comparison with ERT images. This is not \n\nunexpected in coarse texture, since mini disk underestimates hydraulic conductivity by failing to \n\nincorporate to macropores. \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFig.5.20.

Estimating and constraining the hydrological parameters by geophysical data \nThe centre-of-mass vertical motions of simulated flow model in section 5.4.4 (Fig.5.21) were \n\ncompared to the centre-of-mass vertical motions of ERT images calculated in section 5.4.3 and \n\nwere shown in Fig.5.22. A comparison of the centre-of-mass vertical motion graphs shows that \n\nthe water trace sinks faster in the graph, derived from ERT images. As discussed in 3.6.2 how \n\nthe hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil plays the most important role among van \n\nGenuchten\u2019s parameters, we fixed all others van Genuchten\u2019s parameters to be the same values \n\nof the table 5.1(a) and then several new simulations were carried out by changing saturated \n\nhydraulic conductivity value to find the best match on the basis of the sinking process of the \n\nwater during the water-injection experiment. Several values of saturated hydraulic conductivity \n\nfrom ROSETTA database range for sand (Table.5.2) were used for new simulations.   \n\nThe results of the centre-of-mass vertical motions shown in Fig. 5.23 indicate that a hydraulic \n\nconductivity value of 0.65 cm/min can well reproduce the centre of mass vertical motion of \n\ntracer during the period of measurements. The vertical spread of the excess water content (with \n\nrespect to background) resulting from simulating models was also plotted in Fig 5.24 in order to \n\nprovide a better comparison of the simulated models and ERT images.

We used the Rosetta range of Van Genuchten\u00b4s parameters for sands \n\nin Table.5.2. We fixed the saturated water content to be 37% and constrained the residual water \n\ncontent not to exceed from 4% based on the observed water contents of the extracted samples. \n\nWe found that although changing theses parameters in mentioned range influenced the simulated \n\nmodel significantly, it is still insignificant comparing to the importance of the hydraulic \n\nconductivity role in dynamics of the unsaturated sandstone. To better visualize the influence of \n\nthese changes in our simulations, the maximum deviation of centre-of-mass vertical motions \n\nby  , ? and n changes were shown in Fig.5.25. \n\nThe vertical water movement simulations were shown in Fig.5.26 to provide a mean to better \n\nvisualize the water movement in unsaturated zone in order to compare the flow simulations with \n\nresults inferred from ERT images. A homogenous soil using Van Genuchten\u2019s parameters listed \n\nin table5.1a and saturated hydraulic conductivity equal to 0.65 cm/min were used in this \n\nsimulation. The water distribution inferred from ERT images (Fig.5.18 a-h) is to some extent \n\ndifferent with flow simulations shown in Fig.5.26 (particularly near the borders); however the \n\nvertical water movement is consistent. The results indicates that the estimated hydraulic \n\nconductivity well reproduce the water movement. The observed discrepancy between ERT and \n\nsimulated model is not surprising due to simplification of our simulations to homogenous soil, \n\nwhile based on findings summarized in section 5.2 we knew that the soil texture is not fully \n\nuniform along the profile. In addition, the water injection test always contains some unexpected \n\nerrors (e.g. damaged pressure compensating dripper) which make water injection during the \n\nexperiment not to be ideally uniform. Also, the inversion process and the presence of the noise in \n\nERT data are other factor that may contribute to observed disparities between the ERT and \n\nsimulated model.  \n\n\n\n117 \n \n\n \nFig.5.22.

Synthetic Test \nSynthetic numerical experiment was performed to examine how the ERT method could \n\ninherently alter the spatial moment analysis results and thereby influence the resulting of \n\nhydrologic parameters characterization. Forward hydrologic simulation of water movement \n\nduring the water injection was performed. The van Genukhten parameters listed in Table 5.1a \n\nwith Ks equal to 0.65 were used in this synthetic test. Afterward, the development of water \n\ninfiltration was inverted to electrical resistivity maps using equation 5.1. The electrical resistivity \n\nmaps were then used as input for a forward model calculation using the RES2DMOD program. \n\nWe used the same measurement configuration as used in the field. The forward models obtained \n\nwith RES2DMOD program were subsequently used as input for inversion. 5% random errors \n\nwere added to the synthetic data and the forward models were then inverted using RES2DINV. \n\nFinally, the inverted models were used to calculate spatial moment analysis. The inversion of the \n\nsynthetic data were carried out using independent inversion, the crossmodel regularization and \n\n4D space\u2013time methods (discussed in 3-3) in order to provide an insight into different inversion \n\nmethod resulting in spatial moment analyzes. The same discretization was used for all inversion \n\nprocess as well as simulated model. The synthetic test was designed only to be used as a means \n\nto identify errors associated with the ERT method and inversion process and therefore cannot be \n\ncompared with the moment analysis results conducted on the real data.  \n\nThe estimated values of mass, centre of mass vertical motion and vertical spread based on the \n\nsimulation of water movement and the synthetic data are shown in Fig. 5.27, 5.28 and 5.29 \n\nrespectively. (I) in Fig.5.27 to 5-29 show the spatial moment analyzes inferred from the \n\nsimulated model and (II), (III) and (IV) were inferred from the synthetic data inverted by \n\nindependent inversion, the crossmodel regularization and 4-D space\u2013time methods respectively. \n\nFig.5.27, illustrates that the water tracer mass is overpredicted by the ERT method. All inversion \n\nmethods used in the synthetic test overestimated the mass in system; however, the 4-D space\u2013\n\ntime model yielded a better resolution in mass recovery particularly at the beginning of the \n\nexperiment.  \n\nThe centre of mass vertical motion was shown in Fig.5.28. The centre of mass vertical motion \n\ninferred from the synthetic test is ahead of the simulated model. There is a significant difference \n\nbetween the 4-D space\u2013time model and two other inverted models at the beginning in Fig.5.28. \n\nAlthough the centre of mass vertical motion inferred from the 4-D space\u2013time model was also \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\noverpredicted, the estimated values are nonetheless quite close to the true value (difference \n\n?20%).  On the other hand, the vertical spread is more difficult to determine correctly. Fig. 5.29 \n\nshows a drastic difference between the values inferred from the synthetic test and simulated \n\nmodel. This result is not surprising, since the ERT data were inverted using a smoothness \n\noptimization method which spreads the water tracer location more widely over the area of \n\ninterest. \n\nThe results of synthetic test indicates a great difference between the spatial moment analyzes \n\ninferred from 4-D space\u2013time model and two others inversion models at the beginning of the \n\nexperiment. Although, in all inversion methods a coarser vertical discretization was used near the \n\nelectrodes to increase the sensitivity, the water tracer is a small target at the beginning to capture \n\nproperly in inversion process. The large contrast between the electrical conductivity of injected \n\nwater and background also make the inversion process more difficult to recover the sharp \n\nanomaly accurately. The 4-D space\u2013time model did a better job and the result of this method is \n\nvery close to simulated model. As the water tracer penetrated deeper and became more dispersed, \n\nthe results of other inversion methods become more similar and stable and ERT method is more \n\nsuccessful in capturing the water movement and therefore the centre of mass vertical motion and \n\nthe vertical spread were estimated more accurately.  \n\nThe synthetic test results and moment analyze calculations indicate that the determination of the \n\ncentre of mass vertical motion is fairly robust when the water tracer penetrated to deeper zone \n\n(with the less than 20% difference between synthetic test and simulated model). In contrary, \n\npredicting the vertical spread of the water tracer is more troublesome. The high sensitivity of the \n\nsecond moment analysis computation due to inversion process and noisy dataset in borehole \n\nERT survey were also reported by e.g. Binley et al. (2002b), Singha and Gorelick, (2005) and \n\nLooms et al. (2008).   \n\nThe first and second moment computations of field ERT data show also a drastic distortion at the \n\nbeginning in comparison with the synthetic test. Apart from the inversion effect, the influence of \n\nelectrodes at near surface and also water injection might have intensified this contrast between \n\nfield data and synthetic test.     \n\n\n\n124 \n \n\n \n\nFig.5.27.

Conclusions: \n\nThe results of our experiment in Samora-Correia, where the infiltration process was monitored \n\nunder natural condition and also forced infiltration experiment using ERT and EM38 allow to \n\nthe following conclusions: \n\n \n \n\n1. The moisture content variations in unsaturated sandstone and consequently the resistivity \n\nchanges are mainly influenced by daily rainfall due to the fast infiltration in high-\n\npermeability sediments. The both ERT and EM38 are capable to present qualitative maps \n\nof moisture content distribution; however the fast infiltration in unsaturated sandstone, \n\nmake it impractical to monitor water movement under natural condition to estimate and \n\nconstrain hydrologic parameters. In addition, we found it very difficult to work with \n\nEM38 over a dry sandy soil due to the reasons discussed in 5.3.5. \n\n \n\n2. The water injection test conducted at the Samorra Correia proves that fast infiltration in \n\npermeable sediments can be monitored by ground surface ERT successfully. The large \n\ncontrast between the electrical conductivity of injected water and soil in this study \n\nsimplified using the ground surface ERT to monitor unsaturated sandstone and was not \n\nessential to apply a saline tracer which might cause gravitational sinking of the tracer \n\nduring the experiment and requires more complicated interpretation.  \n\n \n\n3. In spite of poor resolution of ERT images to reproduce the precise water tracer mass, \n\nmoment analysis aimed at constraining the hydrological model. The first and second \n\nmoment analysis in this study constrains the range of the saturated hydraulic conductivity \n\nto be in 0.5-1.2 (cm/min). Moreover, the investigation of the influence of van \n\nGenuchten\u2019s parameters in unsaturated flowing simulation confirms again the importance \n\nof the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimation among van Genuchten\u2019s parameters. \n\nSince the synthetic test indicates that ERT method and inversion effects could \n\ndramatically overestimate and distorts the vertical spread in this experiment, the first \n\nmoment is a more reliable tool to constrain the hydraulic conductivity.  On the other \n\nhand, the first moment also was slightly overestimated by ERT method, therefore the \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\nrange of 0.5-0.7 cm/min could be a more accurate estimation for hydraulic conductivity \n\nin this study. \n\n \n\n4. The synthetic test shows that the 4-D space-time inversion model is significantly more \n\nsuccessful in mapping resistivity changes in this experiment. We also found that the 4-D \n\nspace-time method is more user-friendly among methods discussed in section 3-3. It was \n\nvery difficult to apply the crossmodel regularization on our data due to the presence of \n\nnoise in initial data sets. In addition, the synthetic test in this study shows how ERT \n\nmethod and inversion process inherently changes the shape and magnitude of the water \n\ntracer. The correct estimation of the hydrologic parameters depends highly on how well \n\nthe vertical changes in electrical resistivity are captured by the ERT method. Therefore, \n\nthe survey design, i.e., electrode spacing, measurement configuration, the inversion \n\nalgorithm and the electrodes contacts should be optimized in order to improve the vertical \n\nresolution. This is one of many factors that could have an impact on the results. \n\n \n\n5. The temperature data shows more than 5\u00b0c variations during the water injection that \n\naffects significantly (about 10%) in ERT images and is highly required to be modified for \n\na quantitative model.  \n\n \n6. Using Archie\u2019s law instead of the established in-situ relationship for conversion of the \n\nelectrical conductivity to moisture content will considerably underestimates moisture \n\ncontent estimation in this study (despite previous filed site). \n\n \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1D Coupled Geoelectric-Infiltration Model \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n129 \n \n\n6.1. Introduction \n\nERT images are increasingly being converted to hydrological models to estimates of water \n\ncontent or solute mass using petrophysical relationships. The converted images can then be used \n\nfor the estimation of soil hydraulic and transport properties. This method is referred to as \n\nuncoupled hydrogeophysical inversion (Ferre et al., 2009). In fact in uncoupled hydro-\n\ngeophysical inversion, ERT data first are inverted and then converted to soil hydraulic and \n\ntransport properties. This method was used in previous chapters to estimate hydraulic \n\nparameters. As discussed in chapter four and five and was also demonstrated in the synthetic test \n\nin chapter 5, the inversion procedures may propagate measurement errors and uncertainties \n\nrelated to parameter resolution that arise during the independent inversion of the geophysical \n\ndata to the hydrologic analysis. Geophysical inverse procedures commonly require the use of \n\nprior information (e.g. a smoothness constraint) to stabilize inversion problems (e.g. Menke, \n\n1984). It has been recognized that this regularization may not reflect the hydrologic conditions \n\nand can limit the value of hydraulic property estimates derived from geophysical observations. \n\nTemporal inversion techniques as we used can effectively reducing the inversion uncertainty by \n\ninterpreting multiple images simultaneously. However, time-lapse inversion still relies on an \n\nindependent ERT inversion step to infer hydrologic states. We also showed in the synthetic test \n\nin 5.4.6 that even time-lapse inversion can lead to uncertain estimates of soil hydraulic \n\nproperties.    \n\nIn contrary, in the coupled approach, geophysical measurements are directly used in the \n\nhydrological model by coupling a forward model of the geophysical measurements with a \n\nhydrological model. The parameters of the hydrological model (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) are \n\nchanged until the closest match is obtained between simulated model and observed data. The link \n\nbetween these simulated hydrological properties (e.g. soil water content) and the geophysical \n\nproperties required for the modeling of the geophysical measurements (e.g. bulk electrical \n\nconductivity) is provided by appropriate local-scale petrophysical relationships (Hinnel et al., \n\n2010). The distinguishing factor in the coupled inversion strategy is that, for any observed \n\ngeophysical data set, we couple a hydrologic and geophysical model to represent the forward \n\nmodel in the optimization. In practice, this is achieved through a straightforward process where \n\nan initial set of hydraulic parameters is proposed and a forward hydrologic is run using these \n\nparameter values. The model predicted hydrologic states (e.g. water content) are converted to \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\ngeophysical properties using petrophysical relations. The hydraulic properties are optimized to \n\nminimize the difference between predicted and measured geophysical observations. Coupled \n\nmodel does not require a geophysical inversion step, thereby avoiding geophysical resolution \n\nproblems due to inversion artifact. Rather, all of the data are considered in a single process \n\ntechnique by coupling the hydrologic model and the geophysical models. In summary, because \n\ncoupled inversion interprets the geophysical data in the context of the proposed hydrologic \n\nmodel, it provides a better test of the consistency of the proposed hydrologic model with the \n\ngeophysical observations.

We will present and discuss \n\nhere the results of five Vertical Electric Sounding (VES) data from 2D ERT datasets with the \n\nlargest depth of investigation. In Fig.2, we highlighted selected VES by a black rectangle. The \n\ndeepest VES is in the middle of electrodes spread (Marked with \u201cM\u201d) includes 19 measurements \n\nwith minimum and maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of 0.45 m and 5.85m \n\nrespectively.

The black rectangle distinguished the selected VES for coupled \n\nhydrogeoelectrical model. \n\n \n\n L2 L1 M R1 R2 \n\n\n\n133 \n \n\nThe specific problem we consider is the use of VES data to monitor the water movement over a \n\nhomogenous soil during 1D infiltration medium with uniform initial pressure head. As discussed \n\nin 5.4.2, the ERT data consisted of a time series of measurements during and after the water \n\ninjection test. We used the first eight time-lapse ERT data which were measured during the water \n\ninjection for our investigations.  \n\nThe coupled hydrogeoelectrical model requires two forward models: a hydrologic model and a \n\ngeoelectrical model and also a petrophysical relation.  \n\n6.2.1. 1D hydrologic model  \n\nThe hydrologic model enables the simulation of water movement with depth and time based on a \n\nnumerical solution of Richards\u2019equation. To develop a simplified 1D model of unsaturated flow, \n\nh-based formulation of equation 3.39 was used as discussed in 3.5.3. We used van Genuchten \n\nequations (3.37 and 3.38) to obtain a predictive equation for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity \n\nfunction in terms of soil water retention parameters. The time step (?t) and space step (?z) in all \n\nsimulations were selected to be 1 second and 1 cm respectively. The infiltrations models were \n\ntested against HYDRUS 1d software to evaluate the results. The results were consistent with \n\nHYDRUS 1d (not shown here). The mass errors in our simulations were less than 2%.     \n\n6.2.2. 1D resistivity forward modeling  \n\nIn the forward modeling problem, the subsurface resistivity distribution is specified and the \n\npurpose is to calculate the apparent resistivity that would be measured by a survey over such a \n\nstructure (Loke, 2004). For the 1-D case, where the subsurface is restricted to a number of \n\nhorizontal layers, the linear filter method discussed in 3.2.3 is commonly used. The subroutine \n\ndeveloped by Santos et al. (1997) based on the filter method was used to calculate the apparent \n\nresistivity. \n\n6.2.3. Petrophysical Relation \n\nThe hydrologic and electrical conductivity models are linked by the dependence of the soil \n\nelectrical conductivity on the soil water content. Equation 5.1 was used in order to convert soil \n\nwater content to bulk resistivity. \n\n \n\n\n\n134 \n \n\n6.3. Solution of the Analytical Model \n\nFirst, a hydrological model was developed. To achieve an infiltration model, all five van \n\nGenuchten\u00b4s parameters (?r, ?s, ?, n, and Ks) must be estimated. We fixed ?r and ?s to be 0.37 \n\nand 0.03 based on the results discussed in 5.2.  ?, n and Ks parameters range were extracted from \n\nROSETTA database range for sandstone listed in Table.6.1. The parameter ranges were then \n\nsampled using a Latin hypercube method (LHS). This method works like a constrained Monte \n\nCarlo sampling approach (McKay et al., 1979). Each parameter range is subdivided into M \n\nequally probable intervals. For each interval, one value is selected at random and subsequently \n\npaired at random with similarly determined values of the remaining parameters, resulting in M \n\nindependent realizations. All parameters were assumed to be uniformly distributed within the \n\nspecified intervals. A public domain software Latin hypercube sampling tool was used \n\n(http://www.mathepi.com/epitools/lhs/nrpage.html). In this study, the hydraulic parameters were \n\nassumed to be uncorrelated.  \n\nAfterward, a forward resistivity model was coupled to each hydrological model using \n\nEquation.5.1. This allows the simulation of soil water content can be converted into simulated \n\nresistivity distributions. The simulated resistivity images were then used as input for resistivity \n\nforward modeling to calculate ERT data. The simulated data were finally compared with the \n\nfield ERT data using following equation:  \n\n \n\n                                                                                    (6.1) \nwhere ?r is the average relative data error of the transfer resistances and is equal to 0.08 (Looms \n\net al., 2008) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.mathepi.com/epitools/lhs/nrpage.html)\n\n\n135 \n \n\n6.4. Results \n\n1000 parameter sets were sampled using LHS. Flow and transport simulations were then run for \n\neach parameter set using the same initial and boundary conditions. A homogenous soil was \n\nselected for all simulations. The bottom boundary of the soil column was simulated by \n\nimplementing a free drainage boundary condition. The upper boundary condition was a specified \n\nflux of 1.792 cm h?1 corresponding to 20% of the applied irrigation. This value was estimated \n\nfrom the mass error calculated using moment analysis in 5.4.3. The simulations were carried out \n\nfor 180 minutes and the evaporation was neglected in all simulations. \n\nTo evaluate whether the unsaturated hydraulic parameters are constrained by the data, we plotted \n\nthe misfit value (calculated from Equation.6.1) as a function of parameter values Ks, n and ? in \n\nFig.6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 respectively. Each figure has five sections which are related to the misfit \n\nvalues of different VES datasets. a, b, c, d and e in each figure presents the results of misfit \n\nvalues obtained using L2, L1, M, R1 and R2 datasets respectively. Only the 100 realizations with \n\nthe lowest misfit are included in the figures for illustration purpose. The parameter ranges of the \n\nrealizations with the lower misfit values are highlighted with red arrows in all figures and were \n\nalso listed in table.6.1. By comparing the extent of the range of each parameter with the a priori \n\nrange of the selected parameter and by evaluating whether the dots with low misfit values are \n\nclustered at certain parameter ranges, it becomes clear whether the data can reduce the \n\nuncertainty of the hydraulic parameters investigated.  \n\nFig.6.3 and 6.4 indicate that the parameter ranges of Ks and n are constrained compared with the \n\na priori range. Values of Ks in Fig 6.3 (expect 6.3b) centered around 0.80 cm min?1, appear to \n\nresult in slightly lower misfits between the simulated and ERT model and the misfit plots exhibit \n\na clustering at this intermediate Ks value. The results of L2, M, R1 and R2 are acceptably \n\nconsistent while L1 exhibits a wider range. The estimated range of Ks shows a very good \n\nconsistency with the results in chapter 5. Values of n in Fig.6.4 (expect 6.3d) are also constrained \n\nin range of 2-3.6. The results of L2, L1, M and R2 are to some extent consistent, but R1 shows a \n\nwider range.  \n\nIn contrary, Fig.6.5 show that the parameter ? is not constrained by the ERT data, since the range \n\nof the lower misfit realizations is almost identical to the a priori range in most of ERT datasets \n\nand the dots do not exhibit any structure. \n\n\n\n136 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.8\n\n2.9\n\n3\n\n3.1\n\n3.2\n\n3.3\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n3.6\n\n3.7\n\n3.8\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n\nM\nis\n\nfi\nt\n\nKs (cm/min)\n\na)\n\n2\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\n2.4\n2.5\n2.6\n2.7\n2.8\n2.9\n\n3\n3.1\n3.2\n3.3\n3.4\n3.5\n3.6\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n\nM\nis\n\nfi\nt\n\nKs (cm/min)\n\nb)\n\n2.4\n2.5\n2.6\n2.7\n2.8\n2.9\n\n3\n3.1\n3.2\n3.3\n3.4\n3.5\n3.6\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n\nM\nis\n\nfi\nt\n\nKs (cm/min)\n\nc)\n\n\n\n137 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.6.3. the misfit values of the simulated models with VES data as a function of Ks.

Conclusions \n\nWe have developed a coupled hydrogeoelectrical inversion framework in order to estimate three \n\nvan Genuchten parameters (?, n and Ks) from electrical resistances and inflow measurements \n\nobtained during constant head infiltration. The collected data were used in a forward manner to \n\nevaluate a series of plausible hydrologic models. By avoiding the use of geophysical inversion \n\ntools, uncertainties connected with inversion, such as artifacts and subjective constraints (e.g. \n\nregularization choice) were eliminated. The results showed that the joint interpretation of inflow \n\nand resistance measurements provide reasonably good constraints on the estimation of Ks and n.  \n\nMass balance considerations in simulated model revealed that water was being diverted away \n\nfrom the measurement area; however, the consistency of the water loss during the infiltration led \n\nus to adopt an effective average infiltration rate of 20% the applied irrigation. We feel confident \n\nthat this assumption is valid, but one could consider estimating the effective infiltration in future \n\nanalyses to minimize this uncertainty. It is not the only source of uncertainty in our study. The \n\nproposed methodology still required assumptions regarding choice of petrophysical relationships, \n\nsoil structure, investigated parameter ranges, misfit functions and data error levels. All these \n\nvariables are connected with uncertainty and represent subjective considerations that may \n\ninfluence the obtained results markedly. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n144 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConclusion and Recommendations \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n145 \n \n\n7.1. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe key finding of this research was that the apparent electrical conductivity data produced by \n\nERT and EM38 can be used to measure soil moisture and estimate hydrological properties of \n\nunsaturated zone. These methods can efficiently develop the dense datasets for describing spatial \n\nsoil properties variability.  \n\nThe results of this study show that the EM38 is a useful tool for soil moisture measurement and \n\nhence potentially useful in agricultural industry. EM38 proved to be capable in mapping \n\nmoisture content variation in shallow zone where the soil is not very dry. A very dry soil is not \n\nan ideal target when a quantitative and temporal study is required due to the strong influence of \n\nnoise in low values of electrical conductivity. EM38 has the advantage of being less expensive, \n\nmuch faster, and easier to use in data collection in comparison with the ERT method. \n\nFurthermore, EM38 can cover a larger area in regional investigation. Paying special attention to \n\nboth data collection and inversion is greatly important in order to achieve a quantitative model.  \n\nThe ground surface ERT study in Samorra Correia proves that fast infiltration in permeable \n\nsediments can be monitored successfully by ERT surveys. ERT method also yielded an \n\nacceptable quantitative model at the campus of University of Lisbon in a location where had a \n\nloam soil with low permeability and high water retention capacity. The results of ERT surveys \n\nshow a better resolution in mapping the spatiotemporal resistivity changes in comparison with \n\nEM38 where a quantitative model is required.   \n\n1D coupled hydrogeoelectrical model developed in this study showed that the data collected \n\nprovided information enough to constrain the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, and the van \n\nGenuchten parameter n, while it was not possible to constrain the parameter ?. Using additional \n\ngeophysical data such as GPR and EM38 might aim at better constraining the van Genuchten \n\nparameters. Additional information, such as pressure measurements and correlation of the van \n\nGenuchten parameters could be also incorporated to constrain the hydrologic model. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n146 \n \n\nOur study on inversion effects in soil characterization reveals the importance of a careful \n\nconsideration of inverse problem to avoid the effects of overparameterization and smoothing \n\nfrom regularization. Our investigation in both study areas demonstrates that the 4-D space-time \n\nmethod proposed by Kim et al. (2009) could results in a more accurate model with lower \n\nartefacts; however the synthetic test indicates that even the 4-D space-time method still changes \n\nthe shape of the model. Extending the use of coupled hydrological and geophysical models in \n\nhydrology investigation can be significantly reducing the uncertainty by avoiding the \n\nuncertainties connected with inversion. \n\nAssumptions in both study areas regarding the conceptual geologic model, including the 1D or \n\n2D flow assumption, the homogonous soil setup and the assumed constant petrophysical \n\nparameters. Most of these assumptions were made to simplify the conceptual model and \n\nminimize the number of free parameters.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n147 \n \n\n7.2. Recommendations \n\nThis study was confined to two small study areas with nearly uniform soil, to minimize the \n\ninfluence of factors other than soil moisture on EM38 and ERT data. While the results of the \n\nstudy are positive, extension of the study to different areas with a range of soil types is required \n\nto evaluate and generalize the results. \n\n \n\nFurther recommendations include: \n\nTo our knowledge no attempt has been made to develop time-lapse inversions in EMI field. The \n\nabsence of time-lapse inversion of EM38 data made the results unstable and noisy in this study \n\nwhere independent inversion of dataset was carried out and resistivity variation maps were \n\nachieved by subtraction of pixel-by-pixel values from a background image. Developing a time-\n\nlapse inversion algorithm for EM38 data will be a concrete step for expansion of EM38 use in \n\nsoil characterization where a dense multiple dataset is required. \n\nIn this study, the hydraulic parameters were assumed to be uncorrelated. In future work, it would \n\nbe of benefit to include correlation between parameters to constrain the parameter ranges. \n\nConsidering the parameters correlation allows a more efficient sampling of the parameter space \n\nby constraining less free parameters. In addition, all analysis was based on the key assumption \n\nthat the hydrologic model could be expressed using the van Genuchten parameterization. These \n\nmodels may not be the best in the study areas where we were working. Attempts should therefore \n\nbe made to test additional parameterization approaches to evaluate our research. \n\nThe 1D coupled hydrogeoelectrical model developed in this study was used to constrain three \n\nparameters (Ks, n and ?) of Van Genukhten parameters. The coupled approach can be used to \n\nevaluate whether or not the approach can aim at constraining r and s where information of \n\nthese parameters is not available. Since the result of the coupled model is positive, extension of \n\nthe coupled approach to integrating EM38 and hydrologic model is recommended. In addition, \n\nthis coupled model was limited to 1d approach. In order better to describe the hydraulic \n\nproperties of the subsurface, 2D extension of this program for both EM38 and ERT methods can \n\nbe achieved using 2D forward geophysical and hydrological models.  \n\n\n\n148 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n149 \n \n\nArchie, G.E., 1942.

A condutividade hidr\u00e1ulica \u00e9 uma propriedade do solo \n\nque determina a capacidade de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua neste meio e, embora se reconhe\u00e7a a \n\nsua grande import\u00e2ncia continua a ser um dos par\u00e2metros mais dif\u00edceis de estimar.As t\u00e9cnicas \n\nlaboratoriais t\u00eam limita\u00e7\u00f5es devido ao tamanho da amostra e ao facto das condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nlaboratoriais n\u00e3o serem as mesmas que no terreno, havendo prefer\u00eancia pelas t\u00e9cnicas de \n\nmedi\u00e7\u00e3o in-situ. Assim, o desenvolvimento de m\u00e9todos de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o espa\u00e7o-temporal do \n\nconte\u00fado em \u00e1gua no solo \u00e9 muito importante para o controlo daquele par\u00e2metro. \n\nInvestiga\u00e7\u00f5es recentes mostraram que os m\u00e9todos de geof\u00edsica aplicada s\u00e3o uma alternativa \n\necon\u00f3mica, e com a vantagem de serem m\u00e9todos n\u00e3o evasivos, para a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhidrol\u00f3gica do solo. Os m\u00e9todos directos, baseado em furos, provocam altera\u00e7\u00f5es nas \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es naturais do terreno.  Acresce que as medi\u00e7\u00f5es usando m\u00e9todos directos n\u00e3o podem \n\nser repetidas no tempo e no mesmo local, embora a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o hidrol\u00f3gica do solo exija \n\nessa repeti\u00e7\u00e3o. A monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o geof\u00edsica, usando m\u00e9todos 4D (espa\u00e7o-tempo) \u00e9 uma \n\nferramenta poderosa que pode ser usada para adquirir dados que permitam a estimativa das \n\nvari\u00e1veis hidrol\u00f3gicas que dependem do tempo, como a condutividade hidr\u00e1ulica. \n\nNeste estudo, utilizaram-se medidas da condutividade el\u00e9ctrica obtidas atrav\u00e9s de tomografia \n\nel\u00e9ctrica e da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do equipamento EM38 para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma base de dados, com \n\no objectivo de estudar as varia\u00e7\u00f5es espa\u00e7o-temporais do conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua e, tamb\u00e9m, \n\nestimar as propriedades hidr\u00e1ulicas de um solo n\u00e3o saturado. Este estudo foi realizado em \n\ndois locais distintos: um em condi\u00e7\u00f5es naturais e um outro em situa\u00e7\u00e3o de injec\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua. \n\nO primeiro estudo foi realizado no Campus da Universidade de Lisboa, num local em que o \n\nterreno \u00e9 predominantemente argiloso, com permeabilidade baixa e grande capacidade de \n\nreten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua. O segundo estudo foi realizado em Samora Correia (a Leste de Lisboa) \n\nnum local de solo arenoso com permeabilidade elevada e com fraca capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde \u00e1gua. As varia\u00e7\u00f5es de temperatura do solo foram medidas durante as experi\u00eancias e o \n\nefeito da varia\u00e7\u00e3o da condutividade com a temperatura foi avaliado em ambos os conjuntos \n\nde dados adquiridos (EM38 e resistividade), assumindo uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o da resistividade de 2%  \n\npor cada grau Celsius de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura. \n\nA estimativa das propriedades hidr\u00e1ulicas do solo n\u00e3o saturado foi feita com base em \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00f5es de fluxo de \u00e1gua. Os modelos hidrol\u00f3gicos utilizados permitem a simula\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\n\n\n158 \n \n\nmovimento da \u00e1gua em profundidade e em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo com base na solu\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica \n\nda equa\u00e7\u00e3o de Richard. Assumiu-se que a capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua e a condutividade \n\ns\u00e3o bem representadas pelos par\u00e2metros de van Genuchten (1980).  A equa\u00e7\u00e3o de Richard foi \n\nutilizada para o desenvolvimento de um modelo 1D, utilizando um passo temporal de 1 s e \n\nespacial de 1 cm. Os resultados do modelo foram comparados com os do programa HYDRUS \n\n1D com o objectivo de validar o modelo, tendo-se observado que os resultados s\u00e3o \n\nconsistentes com os calculados pelo HYDRUS. Os erros associados \u00e0s estimativas da massa \n\nde \u00e1gua s\u00e3o, aproximadamente de 2%. Para as simula\u00e7\u00f5es do movimento de \u00e1gua em meio  \n\n2D utilizou-se o programa HYDRUS. \n\nO c\u00e1lculo dos par\u00e2metros de Genuchten foi feito utilizando-se duas aproxima\u00e7\u00f5es.Na \n\nprimeira, sem os constrangimentos dos dados geof\u00edsicos e,na segunda usando esses \n\nconstrangimentos. No primeiro caso os dados geof\u00edsicos foram invertidos e os modelos \n\nobtidos usados na estimativa dos par\u00e2metros hidrol\u00f3gicos utilizando-se as rela\u00e7\u00f5es emp\u00edricas  \n\n(determinadas in-situ) entre a resitividade e o conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua (? vs. S). Esta aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfoi usada considerando um modelo 2D. A invers\u00e3o,  utilizando todos os dados recolhidos na \n\nexperi\u00eancia de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o, foi realizada usando-se t\u00e9cnicas de invers\u00e3o conhecidas por \n\n\u201ctime-lapse\u201d, com o objectivo de reduzir as incertezas. Mais especificamente, foram usados \n\nos seguintes m\u00e9todos: o m\u00e9todo da raz\u00e3o (ratio method), das diferen\u00e7as (difference inversion \n\nmethod), model cruzado (cross model) e a invers\u00e3o 4D. Os modelos de resistividade (ERT) e \n\nEM38 foram ent\u00e3o usados para o c\u00e1lculo do conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua usando-se as rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre a \n\nresistividade (condutividade) e o conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua, previamente estabelecidas para cada \n\nlocal.Utilizou-se o m\u00e9todo da an\u00e1lise dos momentos, aplicado aos modelos geof\u00edsicos, para \n\nse calcularem as condutividades hidr\u00e1ulicas. Neste m\u00e9todo procura-se quantificar a massa do \n\nsistema, a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do centro demassa e o modo como a massa se desloca no tempo. \n\nComparando os resultados do m\u00e9todo dos momentos com os obtidos das simula\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ninfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, foi poss\u00edvelobter uma estimativa da condutividade hidr\u00e1ulica. \n\nO estudo relizado no campus da Universidade de Lisboa, usando o primeiro m\u00e9todo mostrou \n\nque ambos os conjuntos de dados geof\u00edsicos (EM38 e ERT) conseguiram detectar varia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nda resistividade do solo representativas da varia\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal do conte\u00fado de \u00e1gua. Os \n\nresultados indicaram que o conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua, mesmo no ver\u00e3o, dificilmente diminui abaixo \n\nde 20%. Apenas se observaram valor baixos de conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua em zonas muito \n\nsuperficiais do terreno e durante o ver\u00e3o.Durante o per\u00edodo chuvoso, o conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua \n\natinge valores de 30%. Os resultados mostram que o solo no campus \u00e9 semi-perme\u00e1vel. A \n\n\n\n159 \n \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o espa\u00e7o-temporal do conte\u00fado de \u00e1gua \u00e9 da ordem de 10%. Os c\u00e1lculos realizados \n\nusando os dados de EM38 e ERT sugerem que a condutividade hidr\u00e1ulica dever\u00e1 ser da \n\nordem de 1-10 cm/dia. Neste local, os resultados obtidos com o EM38 s\u00e3o compat\u00edveis com \n\nos obtidos pelaresistividade (ERT). \n\nNa segunda zona de estudo (em Samora Correia), os resultados mostraram que as varia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndo conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua e, consequentemente, da resistividade.S\u00e3o fundamentalmente \n\ncondicionadas pela precipita\u00e7\u00e3o di\u00e1ria devido \u00e0 r\u00e1pida infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o e elevada permeabilidade \n\nhidr\u00e1ulica dos sedimentos arenosos. Os dados de ERT e de EM38 s\u00e3o capazes de mostrar de \n\nmodo qualitativo a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o do conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua. Ambos os m\u00e9todos s\u00e3o capazes de \n\ndetectar varia\u00e7\u00f5es na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o do conte\u00fado em \u00e1gua, no entanto, a r\u00e1pida infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\nzona n\u00e3o saturada, torna impratic\u00e1vel a monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o para a estimativa e constrangimento \n\ndos par\u00e2metros hidrol\u00f3gicos do movimento da \u00e1gua em condi\u00e7\u00f5es naturais. Adicionalmente, \n\nverificou-se ser muito dif\u00edcil trabalhar com o EM38 em solo arenoso e seco.  Assim, \n\ndesenhou-se e levou-se a efeito uma experi\u00eancia de injec\u00e7\u00e3o controlada de \u00e1gua. Nestas \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es foi poss\u00edvel monitorizar a r\u00e1pida infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o usando o m\u00e9odo da resistividade. O \n\nm\u00e9todo do momento constrangiu o intervalo dos valores da condutividade hidr\u00e1ulica saturada \n\nentre 0.5 e 1.2 cm/min. \n\nFoi realizado um estudo num\u00e9rico com o objectivo de verificar at\u00e9 que ponto a invers\u00e3o (n\u00e3o \n\ncontrangida) de dados de resistividade pode alterar a an\u00e1lise do m\u00e9todo dos momentos e \n\ninfluenciar a estimativa dos par\u00e2metros hidrol\u00f3gicos. Os resultados deste teste mostram que \n\nh\u00e1 uma influ\u00eancia significativa da invers\u00e3o. Contudo, foi poss\u00edvel verificar que a invers\u00e3o 4D \n\napresenta resultados satisfat\u00f3rios. \n\nNo segundo m\u00e9todo utilizado neste estudo, os dados geof\u00edsicos foram usados directamente no \n\nmodelo hidrol\u00f3gico. Nesta aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o os par\u00e2metros hidrol\u00f3gicos foram alterados at\u00e9 se \n\nobter concord\u00e2ncia entre os dados experimentais e as respostas do modelo. Desenvolveu-se \n\num modelo 1D com o objectivo de determinar os tr\u00eas par\u00e2metros de van Genuchten (?, n and \n\nKs)a partir da resistividade el\u00e9ctricae da \u00e1gua infiltrada. Os dados adquiridos em Samora \n\nCorreia, no teste de injec\u00e7\u00e3o de\u00e1gua foram ent\u00e3o utilizados na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de um conjunto de \n\nmodelos hidrol\u00f3gicos prov\u00e1veis. Dado que n\u00e3o se utilizou nenhuma invers\u00e3o de dados \n\ngeof\u00edsicos, as incertezas devido ao processo de invers\u00e3o, tais como artefactos matem\u00e1ticos e \n\nconstrangimento subjectivos foram eliminados. Os resultados obtidos da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o deste \n\nm\u00e9todo, revelaram-se constrangimentos razo\u00e1veis na estimativa de Ks e n. Os valores obtidos \n\n\n\n160 \n \n\nmostram uma boa coer\u00eancia com os obtidos com a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do primeirom\u00e9todo assumindo \n\nmodelos 2D.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n161 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tCover\n\ttable of content\n\tChapter 1\n\tChapter 2\n\tChapter 3\n\tchapter 4\n\tchapter 5\n\tchapter 6\n\tchapter 7\n\tRefrences\n\tResumo Alargado"}]}}}
