Advisor: \nViviani Silva Lirio. Co-advisor: Janderson Damaceno dos Reis. \n\n \n\nThe present works deals with the urban mobility in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, \n\nspecifically the commute mode choice process. Our aim is to analyze how travel time \n\nand travel cost, as well as the commuter characteristics, are associated with the \n\nprobability of choice of a certain mode of transport. Our main hypothesis is that both \n\ntime and cost are negatively associated with the choice of any mode. Our method is the \n\nAlternative-Specific Conditional Logit, a discrete choice econometric model that \n\nenables the inclusion of alternative-specific and individual characteristic variables, \n\nwhich has as main assumption the Independence of the Irrelevant Alternative (IIA): the \n\nprobability ratio of two alternatives depends solely on the characteristics of the these \n\nalternatives. We also employed the Nested logit model, which does not relay on the IIA \n\nassumption, because it nests similar alternatives. Our main data sources are the \n\nmicrodata from the 2007 and 2012 Origin Destination Surveys conducted by the \n\nCompanhia do Metropolitana de S\u00e3o Paulo; besides that, we also used monthly gasoline \n\nprices from the Ag\u00eancia Nacional do Petr\u00f3leo, G\u00e1s Natural e Biocombust\u00edveis and \n\nvehicle mileage from the Instituto Nacional de Metrologia, Qualidade e Tecnologia. The \n\nOrigin Destination Surveys have information about the household and the individual \n\ndemographic and economic characteristics; the position of the household, workplace \n\nand school of the interviewees; and information about the previous workday travels: \n\nweekday, origin/destination zone, purpose at origin/destination, mode of transport, hour \n\nand minute of departure/arrival. The dependent variable, the choice of the commute \n\nmode of transport, has three alternatives: transit, private motorized transport and non-\n\nmotorized modes. The independent variables are travel time and cost (alternative-\n\nspecific characteristics), age, sex, if study, employment relationship and degree of \n\neducation (characteristics of the individual). The results corroborate our initial \n\nhypothesis that travel time and cost are negatively correlated with mode choice, besides \n\nthat, the Conditional logit revealed a Value of Travel Time of 1.78 and 1.09 (nominal \n\nR$) for 2007 and 2012, respectively (the Nested logit revealed a Value of Time between \n\nR$ 0.04 and R$ 2.47): this is the value the average citizen of S\u00e3o Paulo is willing to pay \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto save one hour of commute travel time. The average marginal effect shows both the \n\nown-elasticity and the cross-elasticity of a mode\u2019s cost and time, with these information \n\nit is possible evaluate a series of transport policies that raise or reduce the mode\u2019s cost \n\nor time in order to discourage or encourage it. We perform several tests for the IIA \n\nassumption and we get mixed results: some reject it and some do not, depending on the \n\nmodel chosen and how we nest the alternatives. We conclude that it is possible to \n\nchange the behavioral pattern of choosing the commute mode of transport by changing \n\nthe travel cost and time, grounding possible transport policies that tax or improve the \n\nspeed flow of certain modes relative to others. \n\n  \n\n\n\nx \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nANCHANTE, Jayme Tolpolar, M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, junho de 2017. \nCommute mode choice in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo: an empirical analysis. Orientadora: \nViviani Silva Lirio. Coorientador: Janderson Damaceno dos Reis. \n\n \n\n O presente trabalho trata do tema da mobilidade urbana da cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil, \n\nespecificamente do processo de escolha do modo de transporte no deslocamento de casa \n\npara o trabalho. O objetivo \u00e9 analisar como o tempo e o custo de deslocamento, assim \n\ncomo caracter\u00edsticas do trabalhador, est\u00e3o associados com a escolha de um determinado \n\nmodal. Trabalha-se com hip\u00f3tese de que tempo e custo de deslocamento influenciam \n\nnegativamente a escolha dos modos de transporte. O m\u00e9todo utilizado \u00e9 o Logit \n\nCondicional com Vari\u00e1veis Espec\u00edficas das Alternativas, modelo econom\u00e9trico de \n\nescolha discreta que possibilita a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de vari\u00e1veis espec\u00edficas das alternativas \n\nassim como as do indiv\u00edduo, tendo como principal hip\u00f3tese o pressuposto da \n\nIndepend\u00eancia da Alternativa Irrelevante (IIA): a raz\u00e3o de probabilidades de duas \n\nalternativas depende exclusivamente da caracter\u00edstica destas duas alternativas. Tamb\u00e9m \n\nutiliza-se o modelo Logit Aninhado, que possui como grande vantagem o relaxamento \n\nda hip\u00f3tese da IIA ao aninhar alternativas semelhantes. Nossa principal fonte de dados \n\ns\u00e3o os micro dados das Pesquisas Origem Destino de 2007 e 2012 realizadas pela \n\nCompanhia do Metropolitano de S\u00e3o Paulo; al\u00e9m destas pesquisas, tamb\u00e9m utilizamos \n\ndados dos pre\u00e7os mensais da gasolina da Ag\u00eancia Nacional do Petr\u00f3leo, G\u00e1s Natural e \n\nBiocombust\u00edveis e a quilometragem de ve\u00edculos automotores do Instituto Nacional de \n\nMetrologia, Qualidade e Tecnologia. As Pesquisas Origem Destino possuem \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es sobre as caracter\u00edsiticas demogr\u00e1ficas e econ\u00f4micas do domic\u00edlio e do \n\nindiv\u00edduos; localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do domic\u00edlio, do trabalho e da escola dos entrevistados; e \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es sobre os deslocamentos realizados no dia \u00fatil anterior \u00e0 entrevista, dia da \n\nsemana, zona de origem/destino, motivo na origem/destino, modo de transporte, hora e \n\nminuto de sa\u00edda e chegada. A vari\u00e1vel dependente do modelo, a escolha do meio de \n\ntransporte para o trabalho, possui tr\u00eas alternativas: transporte p\u00fablico, transporte \n\nmotorizado privado e modos n\u00e3o motorizados. As vari\u00e1veis independentes utilizadas \n\ns\u00e3o custo e tempo de deslocamento (caracter\u00edsticas das alternativas), idade, sexo, se \n\nestuda, v\u00ednculo empregat\u00edcio e grau de instru\u00e7\u00e3o (caracter\u00edsticas do indiv\u00edduo). Os \n\nresultados corroboram nossa hip\u00f3tese inicial de que o custo e o tempo de deslocamento \n\n\n\nxi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nest\u00e3o negativamente correlacionados com a escolha modal, al\u00e9m disso, o Logit \n\ncondicional revelou um Valor do Tempo de Deslocamento de 1,78 e 1,09 (R$ nominais) \n\npara 2007 e 2012, respectivamente (o Logit aninhado revelou um Valor do Tempo entre \n\nR$ 0.04 e R$ 2.47): este \u00e9 o valor que um paulistano m\u00e9dio estaria disposto a pagar para \n\neconomizar uma hora de viagem para o trabalho. Os efeitos marginais m\u00e9dios mostram \n\ntanto as elasticidades pr\u00f3prias de tempo e custo de um modo quanto as elasticidades \n\ncruzadas, com essas informa\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 poss\u00edvel avaliar uma s\u00e9rie de pol\u00edticas de transporte \n\nque aumentem ou reduzam o custo e/ou tempo de deslocamento de um modo de \n\ntransporte com o intuito de (des)incentiv\u00e1-lo. V\u00e1rios testes foram realizados para avaliar \n\na validade da hip\u00f3tese IIA e o resultado foi inconclusivo: alguns a rejeitaram enquanto \n\noutros n\u00e3o, dependendo do modelo inicialmente escolhido e da forma como s\u00e3o \n\naninhadas as alternativas. Conclu\u00edmos ser poss\u00edvel alterar o padr\u00e3o de comportamento \n\nde escolha do modo de transporte para o trabalho alterando o custo e o tempo de \n\ndeslocamento dos modais, embasando poss\u00edveis pol\u00edticas de transporte que taxem ou \n\nmelhorem a fluidez de certos modais em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos demais. \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n 1.1. CONTEXT \n \n\n Everyday millions of people living in modern urban cities move between \n\nresidence and work, this phenomenon is known as commute. This task accompanies us \n\nfor most of our adulthood and requires considerable resources: around 8,820 hours of \n\nour lives (around 1 year1).  Despite the clear motivation (going to work), we don\u2019t truly \n\nunderstand it, both from a personal and a social point of view, why do I need to \n\ncommute, what determines the duration of my commute, why do I choose this specific \n\nmode2 and not a different one? The previous might seem too philosophical, so we, \n\nrightfully, stick to more mundane questionings, like will I arrive at my destination on \n\ntime or should I have taken a taxi (perhaps Uber or Cabify) instead of the bus. The \n\npresent work is going to address both theoretically and empirically one such issue: why \n\ndo we prefer a specific mean over the others, this is question is known in the transport \n\neconomics literature as mode choice. \n\n Ever since the Agriculture Revolution, humans have worked in the same place \n\nthey lived, conceptually and practically, the work commute almost didn\u2019t exist. Farmers \n\nplanted and harvested their crops; ranchers raised cattle, all in one \u201cproperty\u201d, the \n\ndivision of labor was rare and most of the population was dedicated to the primary \n\nsector. This lasted with certain stability up until the XVIII century, when another major \n\nchange happened in modern history: the Industrial Revolution. In this new urban \n\nenvironment driven by the market, the city center became highly valued land, primarily \n\nhousing industries of various types, thus concentrating most of the jobs. The workforce \n\nwas displaced to the outer region of cities because of this appreciation of the land, but \n\ntheir access to the city center \u2013 and therefore the industrial jobs \u2013 was guaranteed by the \n\nincipient transit system, moved first by coal, then fossil fuel (nowadays new sources are \n\nappearing, such as the biomass, solar and ethanol). Industrialists and the affluent class \n\nalso moved to the outskirts of the urbes, looking for greener and more spacious areas, \n\naway from dust and disease. This was perhaps the foundation of the work commute as a \n\nglobal generalized institution, conceived and driven by the \u201cmarket forces\u201d. \n\n                                                           \n1 Assuming a one-hour daily commute, 252 work-days in a year and 35 years of work. \n2 We will refer to mode or mean of transport simply as mode or mean. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Later on, other events influenced the way we commute and interact with the \n\nurban space. The emergence of the automobile with a gasoline internal-combustion \n\nengine in the beginning of the XX century was one such event. It was somewhat already \n\npresent since the mid-XIX century; however, the introduction of the mass production \n\nsystem started by the Fordism culminated in an accessible, fast and durable vehicle that \n\nbecame dominant as the commute mode. People could live and work wherever they \n\nwanted, as long as they had a car, the rest was \u201cassured\u201d: the road network was \n\nexpanding rapidly opening new urban frontiers, gasoline was cheap and highways were \n\nfast. Only the 1973 and the 1979 Oil Shocks made us rethink our development model. \n\nGasoline prices skyrocketed \u201cforcing\u201d nations to diverse their energetic and \n\ntransportation matrix. Today the usual commuter, besides the usual private choices as \n\ncars and motorcycles, also has available in its list of modes of transport the public \n\ntransit in its various forms \u2013 buses, trolleybuses, trams (or light rail), trains, subway and \n\nferries. These modes are now part of the urban scenery and proved themselves very \n\nefficient in terms of energy, especially in densely populated areas. \n\nNowadays, in the XXI century, with an ever increasing concern about the future \n\nof the planet\u2019s environment, the non-motorized \u2013 also known as active \u2013 modes are \n\nreturning to vogue, for being non-pollutant, healthy and cheap means of transportation. \n\nOn the technology side, we are witnessing a major change in individual transportation \n\nwith the new cellphone apps, such as Uber, Cabify, EasyTaxi and others, that are \n\nproviding specialized, intelligent and on-demand transportation solutions. \n\nDuring most of the commute development process, governments played a role of \n\nsustaining the fluidity of system constructing and maintaining; organizing it by \n\ninstalling traffic lights, paint and post signaling; and managing it during exceptional \n\ntimes, like accidents, using traffic agents and also during \u201cnormal\u201d times, collecting \n\ntolls for maintenance, for example. The concept that encompasses the previous \n\ninterventions is called passive policies, because the government only reacts to changes \n\nin the traffic conditions. It is still passive in the sense that it can\u2019t make structural \n\nchanges in the current traffic \u201cequilibrium\u201d - e.g. the current congestion level \n\n(DURANTON, TURNER, 2011; HSU, ZHANG, 2014). During the mid-XIX century, \n\ngovernments started to change their behavior towards traffic - one of the milestones was \n\nthe Smeed Report in the United Kingdom (SMEED, 1964) - planning and managing it \n\nkeenly, for example, restraining the access of motorized traffic to some places, usually \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe City Business District (CBD), and charging users for their congestion impact. These \n\nset of policies are called active because, contrary to the passive ones, they have a \n\nspecific goal, generally improving the social well-being (not private interests of a few) \n\nand this goal is usually different of what would have happen had the free forces of the \n\nmarket directed the traffic conditions.  \n\n One of the reasons for government intervention is that many private \n\ntransportation decisions usually lead to sub-optimal social results, as we can see when \n\nwe deal with underpriced roads from the classical routing paradox of Pigou-Knight-\n\nDowns (PIGOU, 1920; KNIGHT, 1924; DOWNS, 1962), unequal competition between \n\ntwo modes as the Downs-Thomson paradox (DOWNS, 1962; THOMSON, 1977) and \n\nalso when poor network building happens as in the Braess paradox (BRAESS, 1968). \n\nOf course, influencing collective decisions can have various outcomes depending on \n\nmany nuances, for example, the type and objective of the operator of such scheme \n\n(private profit maximizing or public welfare maximizing), what is exactly managed \n\n(traffic lanes, whole links or region rings) (DE PALMA, LINDSEY, WU, 2008). \n\n Among the active policies, it seems a world pattern that developing cities usually \n\nimplement some form of road space rationing whereas developed cities ones prefer a \n\ncongestion charge approach. Some permanent rationing scheme examples are: Athens \n\n(1982), Santiago (1986), M\u00e9xico City (1989), Metro Manila (1995), S\u00e3o Paulo (1997), \n\nBogot\u00e1 (1998), La Paz (2003), San Jos\u00e9 (2005), countrywide in Honduras (2008) and \n\nQuito (2010). Other places introduced it temporarily, such as Beijing, Italian cities, \n\nParis and New Delhi. Road pricing schemes have been implemented in Singapore \n\n(1975), Stockholm (2008), Helsinki (2011), London (2012) and Milan (2012). \n\n Another emerging policy outside the \u201cusual\u201d instrument set seems to be the \n\nincentive to the bicycle commute. For example, France announced a program in \n\npartnership with 20 companies (employing a total of 10,000 employees) in the summer \n\nof 2014 offering \u20ac 0.25/km for people who cycle to work. French Transport Minister \n\nFrederic Cuvillier expected that the scheme would boost bike use for commuting by \n\n50% (DE CLERCQ, 2014). However, the results of the six-month trial weren\u2019t so \n\nimpressive: 419 people agreed to participate, but only 19% were shifting from driving, \n\none major obstacle of the scheme is that transit subsidies and free parking are \n\nestablished policies (JAFFE, 2015). Several other countries are implementing such \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\npolicies, for example, the United States approved the Emergency Economic \n\nStabilization Act of 2008, which added the section 132(f) (known as the Bicycle \n\nCommuter Benefit) to the IRS Code, giving the opportunity of employees to receive a \n\nUS$ 20/month, tax-free, from their employers under the simple rule of regularly \n\ncommuting by bicycle, no forms or requirements needed (RUGGIERO, 2016; IRS, \n\n2017). Also, Belgium and Netherlands are offering tax-free payment of \u20ac 0.22 and \n\n\u20ac0.19/km of bike commuting respectively. In Germany commuters biking to work can \n\ndeduct \u20ac0.30/km from their taxable income. In the United Kingdom, more than 10,000 \n\ncompanies use the cycle to work scheme that allows employees to purchase bikes using \n\npre-tax income, thereby saving income tax and other deductions on their pay and the \n\nGerman federal government allows employers to offer \u201ccompany-paid private bicycles\u201d \n\nas a benefit to their employees (BUEHLER, HAMRE, 2014). \n\n A very important aspect, already cited previously, in mode choice is certainly \n\nautomobile ownership and usage dependency, which was observed in the United States \n\nby Downs (1992) and Downs (2004), which was also observed in Brazil by Brinco \n\n(2005). The motorization rate (motor vehicles per thousand people) is growing rapidly \n\nin most of the developing world (GAKENHEIMER, 1999), especially in China \n\n(RILEY, 2002). Total vehicle stock will increase from about 812 million in 2002 to \n\nover 2.08 billion units in 2030. By this time, 56% of the world\u2019s vehicles will be owned \n\nby non-OECD countries, compared with 24% in 2002. In particular, China\u2019s vehicle \n\nstock will increase nearly twenty-fold, to 390 million in 2030 (20.5 million in 2002) and \n\nBrazil\u2019s stock of vehicles jumped from 1 million in 1960 to 20.8 million units in 2002, \n\nwith estimates of going up to 83.7 million units in 2030 (DARGAY, GATELY, \n\nSOMMER, 2007). \n\n Although the automobile offers extraordinary personal mobility and \n\nindependence, it also directly effects the air pollution,  motor vehicle crashes, \n\npedestrian injuries and fatalities (FRUMKIN, 2002). Cars and trucks account for \n\napproximately 30% of emissions of oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons in the United \n\nStates, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (2002). Physical inactivity is \n\na well-documented risk factor for chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease, \n\nstroke, some cancers, diabetes, and depression; it is responsible for about 200,000 \n\ndeaths in the US each year, second only to tobacco, according to the United States \n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (2010). Although we are not explicitly \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsaying that the automobile is causing physical inactivity, it is certainly correlated with \n\nit, since auto trips (especially daily commuting) made at walkable distances could \n\notherwise combine active transportation (also known as non-motorized, represented \n\nmostly, but not totally, by walking and cycling) with an active health lifestyle, \n\ncollaborating with transportation, urban planning and health fields (SALLIS et al., \n\n2004). \n\n On the other side, cycling is related to general health improvement. Hartog et al. \n\n(2010) and Rojas-Rueda et al. (2011) estimated the benefits from a mode shift towards \n\ncycling for Netherlands and for Bicing users, the public bicycle sharing initiative in \n\nBarcelona, Spain, respectively. Oja et al. (2011) made a systematic review on the health \n\nbenefits of cycling, showing a positive correlation with cardiorespiratory fitness among \n\nchildren/adolescents and an inverse relationship with cardiovascular disease/coronary \n\nheart disease mortality, cancer mortality and morbidity among adults. The same goes \n\nfor walking; Lee and Buchner (2008) reviewed the literature related to walking as a \n\nmoderate-intensity physical activity. A practitioner would have lower rates of chronic \n\ndiseases, such as obesity and cardiovascular, less medical expenditures and only a slight \n\nincrease in activity-related injuries. Mutrie et al. (2002) made an intervention in three \n\nworkplaces in Glasgow, Scotland called \u201cWalk in to work out\u201d to promote walking \n\ncommute. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in general and in \n\nmental health, compared to the control group. \n\n Now we move on to present our geographical region of interest, S\u00e3o Paulo, and \n\nits country. Against the policy of most countries and cities that encourage active \n\ntransportation, Brazil is doing the opposite: auto ownership and usage is subsidized, \n\ntransit is encumbered. One of the possible reasons is the automotive industry weight in \n\nthe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its chaining power, policy-makers decided to \n\nexempt new vehicle sales from the Tax over Industrialized Products (IPI), for example, \n\nas a counter-cyclical measure against the world crisis of 2007-2008, and sustained the \n\nreduction of the Tax over the following years. According to the Intituto de Pesquisa \n\nEcon\u00f4mica Aplicada (IPEA, 2009), the IPI policy represented a renunciation of R$ 1.8 \n\nbillion in tax revenue, but also made possible to maintain around fifty thousand direct \n\nand indirect jobs in the country. Alvarenga et al. (2010) estimated that the IPI reduction \n\nwas responsible for 20.7% of the automobile sales in 2009. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 1 reinforces the arguments made in the previous paragraph, we can see \n\nthat the IPCA3\u2019s sub item Personal vehicle4, which comprises all costs of owning and \n\nusing a private motor vehicle, except fuel, is the lowest accumulated inflation in the \n\nJuly, 2006 to December, 2016 period among the selected inflations. In the Panel (a), the \n\nPublic transportation5 accumulated inflation is almost always higher than the IPCA \n\n(represented by the solid black line), except for a short period between July, 2013 to \n\nJanuary, 2015. This is most likely due to the social uprising called the \u201c20 cents \n\nmanifestation\u201d or \u201cJune journeys\u201d whose tipping point that brought the masses to the \n\nstreets was the transit fare adjustment, besides that, also government dishonesty, \n\nunderinvestment in education and health and overinvestment in sports events \n\n(BARREIRA, 2014). Gasoline6 accumulated inflation is much lower than the Public \n\ntransportation or the IPCA during the whole period. Carvalho et al. (2013) analyzed the \n\nPesquisa de Or\u00e7amentos Familiares data also note that the average household spends \n\n3% of its income with public urban transit. However, this is not the same for all income \n\ngroups, the 10% poorer committed 15% of their income and the next decile, 11.7%. \n\nAlso, from the 10% poorer, 30% doesn\u2019t undertake any spending with this item, which \n\ncould be a measure of exclusion, because they lack the pay capacity. \n\n                                                           \n3 IPCA, short for \u00cdndice de Pre\u00e7os ao Consumidor Amplo or Broad Consumer Price Index, is the official \ngovernment target index, which covers families with monthly income ranging from one to forty \n\nminimum wages, whatever the source, living in urban areas. During the period shown in the figure, the \n\ninflation target was 4.5% (with limit bands of \u00b12%).From July/2006 to December/2011, the Weighting \n\nStructure followed the 02/03 Family Budget Survey, and from January/2012 to December/2016 the \n\n08/09 Family Budget Survey. \n4 Personal vehicle is equal to the group . Ve\u00ed ulo pr prio  and it comprises: new automobile, \nlicense plate and licensing, voluntary vehicle insurance (called DPVAT in Brazil), traffic ticket, lubricating \n\noil, accessories and parts, tire and inner tube, automobile repair, parking, toll, lubrication and washing, \n\nused automobile, tow, vehicle paint, vehicle rent and motorcycle. \n5 The Public transportation represents the subgroup created by the author which comprises the sub \n\nite s  . \u00d4 i us ur a o , .

Panel (b) shows the \naccumulated for the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo \n\n  \n\n It is a clear fact that the relative prices between private and public transportation \n\nhas been unfavorable to the latter if we look at Brazil as a whole. In Panel (b), which \n\nshows the same accumulated inflations only for the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo, \n\nwe can make the same points. The relative price is even more disadvantageous to the \n\nPublic transportation, since Personal vehicle has an accumulated negative inflation \n\n(deflation) most of the period up until February, 2014. The period of rise in the Personal \n\nvehicle accumulated inflation coincides with the gradual increase in the IPI (2% for \n\nvehicles less than 1000cc from 01/01/2012 until 31/12/2013, 3% for the same category \n\nuntil 31/12/2014 and 7% from 01/01/2015, which was the original rate prior the \n\nbeginning of the reduction). \n\n Given the priority of the automobile over the more sustainable means of \n\ntransportation, among other factors, apparently traffic conditions are worsening. As \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nshows the Figure 2, average morning commute travel times are rising steadily over the \n\npast twenty years in the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo (MRSP), according to the \n\nInstituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica data7. \n\n A possible explanation for the simplified whole scenario is that as auto trips \n\nbecome more attractive (cost-effective or simply cheaper), more people will use it. This \n\nalso means that less people will use other modes; in the case of MRSP it means mostly \n\nwalking, bus and subway. Because of the inherent properties of transit (that we will \n\ndiscuss in the following sections) in regards to the economies of scale, losing \n\npassengers means at least one of two things: a higher fare or a decrease in the \n\nfrequency. In other words, this leads to a lower level of service, so it becomes less \n\nattractive and the marginal user will choose auto trips. This process is leveraged by \n\npublic national policy that incentives car ownership and usage. As time passes by, \n\ncommuters become more \u201cauto-dependent\u201d and it gets harder to propose policies that \n\ntry to break rule of Automobile Predominant Cities. Even in developed nations with \n\nhigh transit usage, like Europe and East Asia, road pricing policies face great opposition \n\nfrom citizens, even though it is well established in the academia that the whole society \n\ncan benefit from such policy. \n\n                                                           \n7 The calculation methodology can be found in the Appendix A. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Morning commute times of the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo from the \nPNAD data (1993-2013). Panel (a) shows percent sum of categories (%). Panel (b) \nshows average commute times \n\n \n\n Another important aspect in this process is the public expenditure on \n\ntransportation. For example, the S\u00e3o Paulo city council spent on urban infrastructure R$ \n\n454,658,604.3 in 2004, R$ 676,466,698.5 in 2007 and 685,571,645.85 in 2012; on road \n\ntransport R$ 239,960,365.85 in 2004, R$ 443,010,206.2 in 2007 and R$ 633,543,325.79 \n\nin 2012; and on other expenditures on the transportation function (mainly transit \n\nsubsidies) R$ 1,026,263,453.66, R$ 937,682,525.4 in 2007 and R$ 1,708,160,551.41 \n\n(all nominal values). This is the huge budget necessary to maintain the S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s \n\ntransport system functioning: it has the largest values of all Brazilian cities except for \n\nthe urban infrastructure in 2012, which Rio de Janeiro surpasses it, probably because of \n\nthe preparations for the 2012 Olympic Games. \n\n Continuing on the MRSP, it implemented some interesting pioneering policies, \n\nfor example, the Bilhete Mensal, a single fee which gives the right to freely use the city \n\ntransit system, R$ 140,00 for the bus, and R$ 230,00 for bus, subway and train, with a \n\nhalf discount for students (S\u00c3O, PAULO, 2013).

S\u00e3o Paulo was also one of the first Brazilian cities to regulate the \n\nindividual transportation mobile applications in 2016. \n\n With a unique, dynamic and fast grown economy since the XVIII century during \n\nthe gold exploration (FURTADO, 2007), its strength can also be seen in the \n\ntransportation indicators. If the MRSP were a country, it would rank among the top 20 \n\ncountries with a motorization rate (motor vehicles per thousand inhabitants) of 541, \n\naccording to the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles \n\n(International Organization of Motor Vehicles Manufacturers or OICA) and the 2013 \n\nDepartamento Nacional de Tr\u00e1fego\u2019s (DENATRAN) data. The Brazilian average is 198, \n\nmore than two times less than the MRSP. \n\n Apart from the automobile, the MRSP has a robust transport network and is \n\nserved by many public modes. Controlled by the State Government of S\u00e3o Paulo, the \n\nCompanhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) and the Companhia do \n\nMetropolitano (Metr\u00f4) operate the intercity train lines and the subways lines, \n\nrespectively. The city of S\u00e3o Paulo is also served by 16 private bus consortia under the \n\nmanagement of the S\u00e3o Paulo Transportes S.A. (SPTrans), with a total 15 thousand \n\nvehicles and more than 1,300 bus routes. The Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes \n\nUrbanos de S\u00e3o Paulo (EMTU/SP) is a state-controlled company responsible for the \n\nintercity bus system for the five metropolitan regions of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo \n\n(including the MRSP itself) (SPTRANS, 2017). \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Metr\u00f4 (2012c) \n\nFigure 3: Map of the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo, city and traffic zone limits, \nshowing the rail transit system (2012) \n\n \n\n 1.2. RESEARCH QUESTION AND CONTRIBUTION \n\n \n\n The present work aims to explore the relationship between travel cost and travel \n\ntime and the probability of choosing a certain mode of transport in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nThe theoretical and empirical evidence points that both correlations are negative: an \n\nincrease in the cost/time of a given mode of transport is associated with a lower \n\nprobability of choosing it and a higher probability of choosing competitor modes. \n\nPerhaps the true question is how strong this negative association is. \n\n The literature whose geographic interest is also the city of S\u00e3o Paulo - comprised \n\nby Lucinda, Meyer and Ledo (2013), Barcellos (2014), Pacheco and Chagas (2015) \u2013 \n\nusually apply a mixed or random coefficients logit framework (in this model some \n\nvariables have fixed coefficients and others might assume a normal distribution), using \n\ndata from the 2007 Metr\u00f4 Survey. There are several possible improvements in these \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nworks, for example, the Metr\u00f4 has already published a more recent survey in 2012 \n\nwhich updates all previous information brought by the previous survey. Also, these \n\nworks have some methodology issues, for example, they employed the same model for \n\nwork and education trips; also they failed to show how exactly they handled and \n\nconstructed their final database. Besides these studies, we are only aware of another one \n\nfor the city of S\u00e3o Paulo: Swait and Ben-Akiva (1987) which used data of 1985 Metr\u00f4\u2019s \n\nsurvey to calibrate a Parametrized Logit Captivity (PLC) mode, which is a \n\ngeneralization of the dogit model (GAUDRY, DAGENAIS, 1979). \n\n International literature is increasingly focusing in the Generalized Extreme-\n\nValue (GEV) logit models, especially the Cross-Nested specification, leaving behind \n\nmodels which rely on the Independence of the Irrelevant Alternative (IIA) assumption, \n\nas the Multinomial and Conditional Logit models. Nesting is the practice of grouping \n\nsimilar alternatives in nests, which allow for some degree of dependency of alternatives, \n\nwhereas cross-nesting is the practice of allowing the same alternative to belong to \n\ndifferent nests. Small (1987) proposed an Ordered GEV model departure time, which is \n\na continuous variable usually model as discrete intervals; however, he accounted for \n\nboth the order and the dependency of the outcomes. Vovsha (1997) proposed a cross-\n\nnested logit model to study is Tel Aviv, Israel, by using both Stated Preference (SP) and \n\nRevealed Preference (RP) data to model automobile, bus and rail commute choices and \n\ntheir respective access and leg modes. Bierlaire, Axhausen and Abbay (2001) explore \n\nthe stability of different model approaches to the SwissMetro transport data: \n\nMultinomial logit, MNL with non-linear utility function, nested logit and cross-nested \n\nlogit. The previous works also have some areas of improvement, for example, they \n\nfailed to control for individual characteristics which can be highly correlated with the \n\nmode choice; besides that, they could better explain the structure of their database and \n\nhow exactly they constructed their counterfactual trips (if it was necessary).. \n\n Our study makes a few contributions to the mode choice literature. First, we use \n\nboth publicly available transport surveys in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo: the 2007 Pesquisa \n\nOrigem Destino and the 2012 Pesquisa de Mobilidade. Most studies use only one cross-\n\nsection, which makes comparisons between two points in time impossible; and also, \n\nhaving at least two cross-sections allow us to cross-check the results by comparing \n\nthem. Second, we conduct a thorough description and processing on our dataset, \n\nexplaining how and why every single change, exclusion and creation was made, \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nincreasing the transparency of the present work and the reproducibility of the results. \n\nThird, we created a new method for calculating the travel cost for the private mode of \n\ntransport which involves first estimating the yearly mileage from sources outside the \n\nMetr\u00f4 data and also a new insight for estimating the counterfactual travel times by first \n\nfinding each mode of transport speed. Lastly, we took advantage of the full potential of \n\nour dataset including, sociodemographic characteristics of the commuter, which is not \n\nso common in practice, see for instance the works of Bierlaire, Axhausen and Abbay \n\n(2001), Dissanayake and Morikawa (2010) and Washbrook, Haider and Jaccard (2006). \n\n \n\n 1.3. HYPOTHESIS \n\n \n\n Travel cost and travel time are negatively associated with the probability of \n\nchoosing a certain commute mode of transport. \n\nThe individual characteristics of the commuter have various kinds of association \n\nwith the probability of choosing a certain commute mode of transport depending on the \n\ncharacteristic: i) sex, males have a higher probability of choosing private modes than \n\nfemales; ii) age, younger people have a higher probability of choosing transit and non-\n\nmotorized modes than elder people; iii) students have a higher probability of choosing \n\ntransit than non-students; iv) employment relationship, people with a contract have a \n\nhigher probability of choosing private and transit modes than other forms of \n\nemployment relationships; v) education degree, a higher education degree is associated \n\nwith a higher probability of choosing transit and private modes and a lower probability \n\nof choosing non-motorized modes. \n\n \n\n 1.4.

BACKGROUND \n\n \n\n 2.1. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n 2.1.1. Transportation market \n\n \n\n The transport market functions like any other market (e.g. oranges and labor) it \n\nmay be represented, from the point of view of neoclassical economics, by supply and \n\ndemand, equilibrium, price and quantity. Following one of the first formally developed \n\ntheoretical transport models, we can see these relationships from Walters (1961). \n\nAssuming homogeneity (identical vehicles and drivers) and the following traffic \n\nconditions: \n\nConsider two roads connecting A and B and assume that the unit \n(private) cost of a vehicle using road I is represented by C(I) in Figure \n1 [Figure 4 in the present work]. The unit cost is first horizontal but, \nas the number of vehicles increases, some congestion occurs and unit \ncosts rise. Similar conditions are apparent on road II. The unit cost \ncurve or vehicles using road II is lower than the unit cost on road I for \nlow traffic volumes, but for higher traffic volumes the unit cost on \nroad II rise above the cost on road I. The unit cost curve of road II is \nshown by C(II). If we assume that the routes are perfect substitutes \nfor one another we can draw one demand curve for the services of the \ntwo roads (WALTERS, 1961, p. 677-78). \n\n The main cost associated with the vertical axis is travel time. Therefore, as \n\ndemand increases, that is, if more vehicles enter a given transport system, the higher \n\nwill be everyone\u2019s travel time. A more severe and prominent case would be the morning \n\ncommute: as most workers begin at almost the same time (something between 7-9 a.m.) \n\nand in the same place (the Center Business District or CBD), a peak-hour demand \n\nwould make aggregated travel times rise steeply (at an extreme case, it would reach \n\ninfinity or everyone is simply still). \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Walters (1961, p. 678) \n\nFigure 4: Road demand, individual and aggregate private and marginal cost curves in a \nsimplified two-road network with homogeneous drivers \n\nThe unit cost curves C(I) and C(II) in Figure 1 [Figure 3 in the \npresent work] then measure marginal private cost. Equilibrium traffic \nflow can be found by summing the unit cost curves horizontally to \ngive C(T). Then OT is the total traffic flow, OT(I) on highway I and \nOT(II) on highway II. If we take the total traffic as given at OT the \ndistribution of traffic between roads will be efficient only if at T(I) \nand T(II) the marginal social costs, represented by MC(I) and MC(II), \nare equal. In general, efficiency requires a reduction in total traffic \nfrom T to T' and the distribution between roads such that the marginal \nsocial costs are both equal to PT' WALTERS, 1961, p. 678. \n\n Arnott and Small (1994) discusses some extensions of this simple model, which \n\nis also known as the Pigou-Knight-Downs paradox, due to the works of Pigou (1920), \n\nKnight (1924) and Downs (1962). For example, one can introduce a new mode choice: \n\ntransit, as in the Downs-Thomson paradox, due to Downs (1962) and Thomson (1977); \n\nor a different type of road network can be specified as in the Braess paradox, due to the \n\nwork of Braess (1968). These and other cases are mathematically formalized in the book \n\nof Small and Verhoef (2007), for example, the case of two modes \u2013 car and transit \u2013 and \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntwo roads - one free and other tolled \u2013 under a first-best and a second-best pricing \n\npolicy. \n\n Other topics and paradigms about the transportation market are highlighted in \n\nthe following paragraphs. The road network is often cited as an example of a public \n\ngood. Public goods have both the characteristics of being non-rival and non-excludable. \n\nA good is considered non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to \n\nthe marginal individual is zero or if its consumption by one consumer prevents \n\nsimultaneous consumption by others. A good is non-excludable if non-paying \n\nconsumers cannot be prevented from accessing it (MYLES, 1995). The simple \n\ntransportation market representation shows that roads are rival, because, as more people \n\nuse it, the marginal cost increases. Also, roads are excludable, because it is possible to \n\nexclude non-payers from using it, as it is happening in congestion charge schemes \n\npreviously cited. That is why congestionable goods are better called impure, according \n\nto Myles: \u201cSuch public goods are termed impure. The utility derived by each household \n\nfrom an impure public good is an increasing function of the level of supply and a \n\ndecreasing function of its use.\u201d (1995, p. 259). \n\n During high congestion periods, the inefficient allocation follows the rule of first \n\ncapture, as highlighted by Nash (2007): the road is used by those who arrive first and \n\nnot by those who most need (ambulances, firefighters etc.) or value (high willingness to \n\npay) it. Given a certain congestion level, the roads are used by those who are willing to \n\nbear its cost. Therefore, each individual, depending on their marginal cost, will have \n\ndifferent incentives to use the roads. \n\n The problem of overuse of the roads can also be seen from the point of view of \n\nthe Tragedy of the Commons (HARDIN, 1968). Even though society would be better \n\noff with less road use (the social equilibrium, for instance), each individual has \n\nincentives to deviate and consume more than the \u201cagreed\u201d. Again, it occurs because of \n\nthe difference between the private and the social costs. \n\n \n\n 2.1.2. Downs-Thomson Paradox \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n There are many ways our problem could be studied. We will present first a \n\nsimple model known as Down-Thomson (D-T) Paradox, where the commuter has two \n\nroute choices: a congestionable facility for auto driving and a transit route, to illustrate \n\nhow incentives to private modes can be \u201cperverse\u201d to public transportation. Then we \n\nwill derive a formal mathematical model for the fare level given an underpriced auto \n\nalternative. \n\n The D-T Paradox occurs in the sense that every individual traveler suffers from a \n\nhigher generalized travel cost after the highway capacity expansion due to the direct and \n\nindirect effects of the volume shifting. It is named after the seminal papers of Downs \n\n(1962) and Thomson (1977). \n\n We will discuss the paradox using the example presented by Arnott and Small \n\n(1994). Consider a commuter facing a route decision, whether take: i) a congestionable \n\nfacility, e.g. an expressway with a bridge, for the auto mode; or ii) a transit alternative, \n\ne.g. rail, which operates with economies of scale, that is, frequency rises (and travel \n\ntimes decreases) as more people use it. Any capacity expansion in the auto route, as \n\nwell as any policy that benefits the auto usage like the IPI reduction in the Brazilian \n\ncase, will divert people to the congested road, thus travel times will tend to remain \n\nconstant. \n\n However, this incentive also imposes an external cost on transit users, as less \n\npeople use transit, frequency decreases and travel times increases. The paradox only \n\ndisappears if bridge capacity is expanded above the level where it can accommodate all \n\ncommuters, which is usually not feasible in practice, due to high investment costs. \n\n We will now turn to the mathematical model presented by Small and Verhoef \n\n(2007) about optimal fare level of public transit when there is a competing mode that is \n\nunderpriced at peak-hour. We will assume that the transit alternative is some form of \n\nrail because it doesn\u2019t interact with the automobiles on the road, leading to a simpler \n\nmathematical formulation. \n\n Let  and ?  be the auto and rail trips per unit of time, with vehicle flow rate of = . The joint demand for these two types of travel can be derived from a benefit \nfunction , ? , which is the area under the inverse demand curve for the case of \nmore than one good. The inverse demand for either mode, given the amount consumed \n\nof the other type, is the partial derivative of the benefit function: \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n, ? = ?, ?  , = ,                                         (1) \n Let ?  and ? ?  be the total cost functions for auto and rail, including user \ncost for auto and both user and agency costs for rail: = ? = ?? = ??? + ?? = ? ? ??? ? + ? ? ?? ?          (2) \n As said before, costs on the two modes are independent of each other. The \n\ngeneralized price of mode = ,  is defined as the average user cost, , plus toll \nor fare payment, ? , and the user equilibrium conditions are such that marginal benefits \nare equal to this price for each transportation good: \n\n? = + ?\n? = ?? ? + ??                                                (3) \n\n Social surplus can be defined as benefits minus costs: = , ? ? ? ? ?                                      (4) \n The first-best solution is the marginal-cost pricing for each mode. First-order \n\nconditions for maximizing Eq. (4), after substituting Eq. (3), produce the following \n\nfirst-best policy: ? = ??? = ? ??? + ??? + ? ???? ? ??                         (5) \n The optimal road tax is the usual Pigouvian toll. The optimal transit fare is the \n\naverage agency cost with downward adjustments for any scale economies there might \n\nbe in the user costs (first term) and agency costs (last term). The identity, ?? , is the \nshort-hand for the three rail-cost terms, known as quasi first-best toll. \n\n Now consider the second-best solution, where auto toll is fixed at zero. We set \n\nup the Lagrangian for this case: \n\n? = , ? ? ? ? ? + ? [ ? ? ] + ? ? [ ??? ? +?? ? ?? ]                                                    (6) \n We find that ? =  and, substituting this and the constraints into the firs-order \nconditions with respect to  and ? , we obtain the following optimality conditions: \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n?? ? ?? + ?? ? =    ? ? + ? ? ?? =                                        (7) \n Where ?? ? and ??  are second derivatives of , ? . The second-best \ntransit fare is therefore: \n\n?? = ?? ? ? ? ? ??????? ????                                          (8) \n This second-best optimal fare equals the non-internalized marginal cost of \n\ntransit, ?? , less a term that multiplies the marginal congestion externality on the road \n( ? ) by a weight depending on demand sensitivities and marginal congestion cost. It \ndepends not only on the slope ?? , but also on the cross-effect ?? ?. This last weight \nis equal the number of new road travelers per rider deterred from the rail. \n\n We can understand Eq. (8) considering some special cases. If modes are perfect \n\nsubstitutes, ?? ? = ?? &lt; and both are equal to ?, the slope of the combined \ninverse demand curve for auto and rail trips together. It becomes the same solution as \n\nthe case for two parallel roads where one is optimally tolled, except for the quasi first-\n\nbest rail fare, ?? . When the modes are imperfect substitutes, the fraction remains \npositive (so the entire term is negative), but it is smaller than the perfect substitutes \n\ncase. This is because the cross-derivative in the numerator is smaller in absolute value \n\nthan the second derivative in the denominator, making it less attractive to lower the \n\ntransit fare in order to reduce auto congestion from an efficiency point of view, because \n\nthe modes are imperfect substitutes. \n\n When cross-elasticities of demand are zero, the whole fraction becomes zero. \n\nThe quasi first-best (?? = ?? ) becomes optimal, because auto use can\u2019t be affected. \nWhen the modes are complements, so that ?? ? becomes positive, the fraction becomes \nnegative and the entire term becomes positive: we then raise the rail fare beyond \n\nmarginal cost in the transit market because doing so reduces auto traffic \n\n(complementarity would be a situation where most auto traffic consisted of people \n\ntraveling to a transit station). \n\n We can also introduce some non-zero ?  charge for autos replacing ?  by ? ? ? . We can also rewrite ??  in terms of average and marginal costs of Eq. (5) \nand put the result as a per-user transit subsidy ?? : \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n?? ? ??? ? ?? = ? ? ? ? + ? ? ? ? ? ??????? ????             (9) \n Eq. (9) shows there are two sources of second-best transit subsidies in the model. \n\nThe first one is scale economies: if average cost exceeds marginal cost, it is desirable to \n\nsubsidize the difference. The second is auto congestion: insofar as lowering transit price \n\nis effective in reducing congestion costs by drawing away automobile users, it is \n\ndesirable to use subsidies to encourage this result. \n\n The size of the component depends on the degree of on the degree of \n\nunderpricing on auto traffic. If optimal congestion pricing was in place, the whole term \n\nwould disappear and optimal subsidy would be much smaller. Therefore, congestion \n\npricing can be viewed as a solution not only to the problem of traffic congestion, but \n\nalso to the problem of transit finance. We will not turn to the literature review regarding \n\nmode choice and pricing policies. \n\n \n\n 2.1.3. Random utility maximization model \n\n \n\n The following discussion of the random utility maximization (RUM) model is \n\nbased on Koppelman and Bhat (2006). The utility, , is a function of the attributes of \n\nthe alternatives and the characteristics of the individuals. If one alternative is chosen, it \n\nmeans that it has higher utility than others in the choice set. In other words, if \n\nalternative  is chosen if and only if the utility of alternative  is greater than or equal to \n\nthe utility of all other alternatives , in the choice set, : \n\n ( , ) ,   ?  ? >    ? ?                           (10) \n Given that, we can say that alternative  is preferred over other alternatives , in \n\nthe choice set . The random utility states that the utility function of individual  and \n\nalternative , , has both a deterministic or observable portion, , and a stochastic or \n\nrandom portion, ? , such that: \n= + ?                                                      (11) \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Also, we can say that the probability ?  that individual  chooses  is equal to \nthe probability of  being the largest of all , \u2026 , . With ? { \u2026 } denoting the \nalternative that decision maker  chooses, this probability is: \n\n? = ? = = ? ( >  ? = \u2026 ? ? )                                                        = ? (? ? ? ?  ? = \u2026 ? ? )            (12) \n Given the deterministic part of the function, the probability will depend upon the \n\ndistribution of the stochastic errors. Equation (12) shows two interesting features of \n\nRUM probabilities: i) it is based on utility differences only, that is, the addition of a \n\nconstant doesn\u2019t change the outcome probabilities; and ii) the scale of the utility is not \n\nidentified, multiplying each utility by a constant doesn\u2019t change the probabilities, so \n\nRUM models must normalize the utilities. \n\n The systematic (or deterministic) utility can also be divided into three parts: \n\n associated with the characteristics of the individual ;  associated with the \n\nattributes of the alternative ; and ,  which results from an interaction between \nthe attributes of alternative  and the characteristics of individual : = + + ,                                     (14) \n Considering the Conditional logit (CL) \u2013 but the assumptions also applies to the \n\nMultinomial logit (MNL) \u2013 it assumes that the error terms are independent and \n\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) as extreme value type I with a variance ? = 6? . \nMcFadden (1974a) demonstrated that the ?  that individual  chooses  is: \n\n? = ?? ?=                                                     (15) \n In the CL, the errors are assumed i.i.d. and they capture all unobserved \n\ndeterminants. If two alternatives are similar, errors might be positively correlated, for \n\nexample, in the case of a mode choice model, bus and train are both transit alternatives. \n\nIf the assumption of i.i.d. errors is violated, it means that CL and MNL parameters are \n\nbiased. Therefore, the CL model relies on a strong assumption: the Independence of \n\nIrrelevant Alternative (IIA). \n\n \n\n 2.3.1.1. Independence of Irrelevant Alternative (IIA) tests \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The IIA assumption is commonly explained in the context of the blue bus/red \n\nbus paradox. Suppose an individual has equal chances (one to one ratio or fifty-fifty per \n\ncent) of choosing between its car and the red bus to commute. A new alternative is \n\nintroduced \u2013 the blue bus \u2013 and it has the same characteristics as the red bus, except the \n\ncolor. If the IIA holds, the ratio of choosing between the red bus and the car should \n\nremain the same as before (one to one ratio), but now it must be 33.33 to 33.33%, \n\nbecause the blue bus also has a 33.33% chance. A more natural scenario would be the \n\ncar continuing to have a 50% chance and other 50% equally distributed between the red \n\nbus and the blue bus. \n\n There are various tests to see if the IIA assumption holds, we will follow the \n\ndiscussing in Cheng and Long (2007), although the author are very reticent about the \n\nsize and power of the following tests. McFadden, Train and Tye (1981) propose a \n\nlikelihood ratio test comparing the full model (which includes all possible outcomes for \n\nthe dependent variable) and a restricted model with ?  alternatives: \n= ? [ ( ? ) ? ( ? )]                                      (16) \n\n Where  is the log-likelihood function for the restricted estimation. Quite \n\nsimply, the test compares the value of the log-likelihood equation from the restricted \n\nestimation to the value obtained by plugging estimates from the full model into the log-\n\nlikelihood from the restricted model. When IIA holds, MTT is distributed as a chi-\n\nsquare with degrees of freedom equal to the number of parameters in the restricted \n\nmodel. \n\n The Small and Hsiao (1985) showed that MTT is asymptotically biased toward \n\naccepting the null hypothesis, so they propose a modified version of the MTT. First, the \n\nsample is randomly divided into subsamples A and B of roughly equal size. The full \n\nmodel from equation (1) is estimated on both subsamples, with estimates contained in \n\n and . The weighted average of the coefficients from the two samples is defined \n\nas: \n\n ? = ? + [ ? ? ]                                      (17) \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n A restricted subsample is created from subsample B by eliminating all cases \n\nwith a given value of the dependent variable\u2014in our case, category . The restricted \n\nchoice set is estimated using the restricted subsample yielding the estimates  with the \n\nlikelihood function . The Small-Hsiao statistic is: \n\n= ? [  ?? ? ? ]                                     (18) \n In which SH is asymptotically distributed as chi-square with the degrees of \n\nfreedom equal to the number of parameters in the restricted choice set. \n\n Hausman and McFadden (1984) proposed a Hausman test (Hausman, 1978) that \n\ncompares the estimates ? , which are consistent and efficient if the null hypothesis is \ntrue, to the consistent but inefficient estimates ?. The HM test is defined as: \n\n= ( ? ? ? )[ ?? ( ? ) ? ?? ( ? )]? (? ? ? )                    (19) \n Where ?? ( ? )  and ?? ( ? ) are the estimated covariance matrices. If IIA \nholds, HM is asymptotically distributed as chi-square with degrees of freedom equal to \n\nthe rows in ?. Significant values of HM indicate that the IIA assumption has been \nviolated. Hausman and McFadden (1984) note that HM can be negative if ?? (? ) ??? ( ? ) is not positive semidefinite, but they conclude that this is evidence that IIA \nholds. \n\n \n\n 2.3.1.2. Relaxing the Independence of Irrelevant Alternative assumption \n\n \n\n If the IIA assumption is rejected, one could use Nested multinomial logit \n\n(NMNL) since it relaxes the i.i.d. errors assumptions by allowing similar alternatives to \n\nhave correlated errors in the same nest.  We follow Heiss (2002) for a derivation of the \n\nmodel consistent with RUM. The researcher can partition the choice set into  subsets \n\n(nests) , = , \u2026 , . The nest which alternative = , \u2026 ,  belongs as : = { : ? , = , \u2026 , }                                 (20) \n The probability of individual  choosing  can be decomposed into two parts, ? =  - for a nesting structure of =  \u2013 is equal to the product of the probability \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto choose some alternative in nest , ? {   }, and the conditional \nprobability to choose  given that the nest has already been chosen ? { =|   }, that is: ? = Pr = = Pr{ = | ? } ? Pr{ ? }               (21) \n In the nested logit, the set of errors ? , \u2026 , ?  are assumed to follow a the \ngeneralized extreme-value (GEV) distribution \u2013 which is a generalization of the extreme \n\nvalue type I CL assumption - that allows for alternatives within nests to be correlated. \n\nLet  denote the correlation in the nest , and define the dissimilarity parameter be ? = ? ? . The marginal distribution of each error is an extreme value type I. \n The inclusive value for the ? nest corresponds to the expected value of the \nutility that decision maker  obtains by consuming an alternative in nest . It is a \n\nrescaled measure of attractiveness of the nest . Denote this value by : \n\n= ? ??                                            (22) \n The marginal choice probability for alternative , ? , comprises two ratios. The \nfirst one shows the conditional probability of choosing  given some alternative in the \n\nnest. The second is the probability of choosing some alternative from nest  is a CL \n\nprobability for the choice between the nests. \n\n? = ??? ? ? ?? ? ??=                                              (23) \n This probability is the full information likelihood contribution. The CL model is \n\na special case of the NML where ? = , ? = , \u2026 , . Also, the NMNL model is \nconsistent with RUM if all ?  lie in the unit interval. \n Another possibility is the more generalized approach of the Cross nested \n\nmultinomial logit model (CNL), we will follow the explanation of Bierlaire (2006). The \n\nprobability of choosing alternative  within the choice set  of a given choice maker is: \n\n? | = ???? ,\u2026,?? ,\u2026,                                                (24) \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Where the  is the number of available alternatives, = ? ,  is the \ndeterministic part of the utility function associated with alternative , and  is a non-\n\nnegative differentiable function defined on +. A more familiar exposition of the same \nformula, given homogeneity of  and the Euler\u2019s theorem is: \n\n? | = ? + ? \u2026? ? + ? \u2026=                                              (25) \n Where = ? . There are various possible formulations depending on the \nresearcher\u2019s objective, for example, Small (1987) studied departure time choice with a \n\nmodel called Ordered GEV and Vovsha (1997) applies the model to a mode choice \n\napplication, where one of the mode belonged to two nests. Wen and Koppelman (2001) \n\nproposed a formulation of a \u201cgeneral\u201d GEV model based on the following generating \n\nfunction: \n\n( , \u2026 , ) = ? (? ? ? ??? )?                           (26) \n Where ?  and &lt;. The condition ? ? =  ? ? provides \nuseful interpretation of nest allocation. Also, Wen and Koppelman (2001) provide \n\ndirect- and cross-elasticities formulae for the model. \n\n \n\n2.2. EMPIRICAL STUDIES \n\n \n\n This section explores some studies of the vast and increasingly richer mode \n\nchoice literature. This field \u201cbegins\u201d with the seminal paper of McFadden (1974a) as a \n\nfirst attempt to model discrete choice combining statistical analysis and economic \n\nbehavior theory, since then the author has contributed with a wide range of theoretical \n\nand practical models. The empirical part has evolved from the bi-outcome logit, the \n\nMultinomial logit (MNL), the Nested logit (NL) to an even broader class of models \n\nknown as generalized extreme value (GEV) model, from which can be derived all the \n\nprevious models and even a fairly useful Cross-nested logit (CNL) model, in which the \n\nsame alternative can belong to more than one nest. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n As we said before, McFadden (1974a) gave the microeconomic foundation \n\nbased on utility theory to the statistical model baptized as Conditional Logit (CL). \n\nAmong other things, its first axiom of the Independence of Irrelevant Alternative (IIA) \n\nstates that the odds of  being chosen over , given the choice set , depends solely on \n\nthe characteristics of alternatives  and , regardless of other alternatives \u2013 , , \u2026 ,  \n- in . We will talk no further here about its properties because we already did it in the \n\nprevious section. \n\n McFadden (1974b) derives mathematically the commute mode choice based on \n\nmicroeconomic utility maximization. The author starts by stating the general individual \n\ndecision as a utility maximization given a budget constraint problem, then moves to the \n\npopulation choice behavior or aggregated demand, from which he assumes there is a \n\nrepresentative individual with  alternatives described by a vector of  attributes, the \n\nutility function is made up of a portion of deterministic part and a stochastic term that \n\ndenotes the individual idiosyncrasies. The ending expression, after some distributional \n\nand equation forms, is a conditional logit model. The author uses data on 213 \n\nhouseholds from the San Francisco Bay Area before and after the introduction of a new \n\nrail system called the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). First, McFadden ran a binary \n\nlogit for auto and bus choice and four model specifications (including family income, \n\ncost, time, walk time, bus waiting and transfer time and alternative specific constant). \n\nAfter the appropriate discussion of the results, McFadden discusses whether the \n\n\u2018unexplained residual\u2019 from the binary logit model was correlated with the independent \n\nvariables. Regressing the residual estimates on the survey\u2019s omitted variables to see if \n\nany of them is significant and should be included in the model and also the possibility \n\nof simultaneity between mode choice and the independent variables. The author also \n\ncalculates the BART patronage using the CL, Cascade and Maximum models given \n\ncertain assumptions. \n\nBen-Akiva and Lerman (1974) develop the theory and estimation of a joint \n\ndecision of car ownership and commute mode choice by using a single Multinomial \n\nlogit (MNL) model. The way they overcome this problem is by simply multiplying each \n\nalternative in car ownership choice set by the counterpart of mode choice, generating a \n\njoint choice set of the form: (1) own zero autos and take transit; (2) own one auto and \n\nuse car; (3) own one auto and use transit; (4) own two or more autos and use car; and \n\n(5) own two or more autos and use transit. This simplification led to a feasible statistical \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nestimation, however, there are two major problems with this approach: i) from a \n\npractical point of view, implicitly, they are assuming that the both choices are \n\nsimultaneous, but it is more plausible to think that car ownership is a prior decision; and \n\nii) it also had an econometrical problem regarding the IIA assumption, which can\u2019t be \n\nsustained under such model. The data consisted of 1968 Home Interview Survey \n\nperformed in Washington D.C., observations were excluded when no work trips were \n\nmade, chosen mode was neither transit nor car and intra-zonal work trips. Independent \n\nvariables were alternative specific constants, number of auto per licensed drivers, \n\nhousehold income, travel time, travel cost and a dummy variable for trips whose \n\ndestination is the CBD. Value of in-vehicle travel time ranged from 8.59 to 11.14US$/h \n\nand out-of-vehicle from 39.16 to 58.87US$/h.  \n\nMcFadden (1978) studies residential location and is the first author to derive the \n\ngeneralized extreme value (GEV) model consistent with economic choice theory, the \n\nauthor is particularly interested in two problems: first, how to model individual \n\n(disaggregate) choice among residential location; second, how to estimate such model \n\nwhen the number of elemental alternatives is impractically large. McFadden\u2019s insight is \n\nthat some dwellings are sufficiently similar on their observed characteristics to be \n\ntreated as different and independent options in the choice, instead dwelling units which \n\nare perceived as similar are aggregated, depending on the degree of similarity. At one \n\nextreme, the elements of the aggregate will be perceived as independent, and choice will \n\nbe described by a Multinomial logit with individual dwellings as alternatives. At the \n\nother extreme, all dwellings with the same observed attributes will be perceived as \n\nvirtually the same, and the choice will be described by a Multinomial logit with \n\ndwelling types. McFadden moves on to explain the theory of housing location choice, \n\nbriefly, it depends on the attributes of the alternative, such as quality of public services, \n\nneighborhood and dwelling characteristics, as well as the consumer characteristics, such \n\nas age, family size, income etc. Then, the author derives the \u201cusual\u201d approach, which is \n\nto estimate two separate Multinomial logit models, first estimate the probability of \n\nchoosing a community (neighborhood) c, using a vector of observed attributes which \n\nvary only with community, then estimate the probability of choosing some dwelling n \n\ngiven the community, using a vector of attributes which vary with both community and \n\ndwelling. This approach follows the IIA assumption and requires less computational \n\neffort; however, there is a loss of efficiency (relative to estimating both models \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsimultaneously). Finally, the author proceeds to derive the GEV, whose special cases \n\nare the Multinomial (with the inclusive coefficients equal to one) and the nested logit \n\nmodels (where each inclusive value must lie in the unit interval to be consistent with \n\nrandom utility theory). The GEV model allows for general pattern of dependence \n\namong unobserved attributes of alternatives and yields an analytically tractable closed \n\nform for the choice probabilities. \n\n Train (1980) represents the joint probability of car ownership and commute \n\nmode choice as a two-step procedure, being the first is the conditional probability of a \n\nworker choosing a certain mode given his car ownership level, the second is the \n\nmarginal probability of the household choosing a certain car ownership level over all \n\nmodes. This assumption enabled the estimation processes by two independent MNL \n\nmodels: one for car ownership and another for commute mode choice. They run the \n\nmodel using data of the 1975 BART Survey. \n\n Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985) textbook is a milestone in the discrete choice \n\nliterature, since it first compiles very didactically both theory and practice of mode \n\nchoice analysis. For the non-specialist, is begins with some key statistical concepts and \n\nindividual choice behavior theory. It moves to Binary and Multinomial logit models, the \n\nrespective forecasting and testing techniques. The final part addresses the Nested logit \n\nand the systems of models, which include not only the mode of transportation decision, \n\nbut also job and house location, car ownership, destination for non-work trips etc. \n\n Small (1987) might be the first researcher to empirically estimate a GEV model, \n\nproposed by McFadden (1978). If there is proximate covariance, that is, a correlation \n\namong the unobserved random utility components for alternatives which are closer \n\ntogether on a natural ordering, the IIA might fail. One case is when the dependent \n\nvariable is a discrete representation of an underlying continuous variable. The model \n\nproposed by Small requires only that for a fixed , the correlation between random \n\nutility components for alternatives  and  be a non-increasing function of | ? |. His \nordered generalized extreme value (OGEV) model results from the function: \n\n( , \u2026 , ) = ? [? ? ???? ? ]??+=                              (27) \n Where  is a positive integer,  and  are constants satisfying &lt;= , \u2026 , + , , ? == = , \u2026 ,  and where =\n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n{ ? { , \u2026 , }| ? }. The difference between the OGEV and the NL model is \nthat, in the first one, the subsets  overlap, that is, each +  subset contains up to +  contiguous alternatives. Since each subset can have its own parameter , this \nprovides considerable flexibility to the correlation patterns, whose special case is when =   ?   it reduces to a MNL. The author also discusses an extended ordered \nGEV (EOGEV) model which further develops the OGEV. Small implements the four \n\nmodels (MNL, NL, OGEV and EOGEV) on two datasets, presented in Small (1982) \n\nand Train (1980), respectively; the first one is a sample of 527 commuters who must \n\nchoose their work arrival time between 12 alternatives (ranging from 40min early to \n\n15min late, with a 5min intervals); the second is a dataset consisting of commuter car \n\nownership and mode choice decisions. The generalized models performed poorly \n\ncompared to the MNL and NL models, exacerbating errors on misspecification and/or \n\nomitted variables. \n\n Available data usually contains information on the actual or observed choice of \n\nthe commuter, leaving the analyst the task of specifying the remaining not chosen \n\nalternatives or counterfactuals. A common practice is just ignoring this problem \n\nassuming that all decision-makers have the same choice set. However, Swait and Ben-\n\nAkiva (1987) used the MNL model as a benchmark comparing it with a Parametrized \n\nCaptivity Logit, which incorporates a probabilistic component for generating the \n\nalternatives to be included in the choice sets: the model separates the choice makers \n\nwho are captive to a single mode to the ones that really have a full choice set. The first \n\nstage of the estimation process consists of the choice set generation, the second is the \n\nactual mode choice. The model was calibrated for S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, using the 1977 \n\nOrigin-Destination Survey\u2019s data. \n\n Vovsha (1997) proposes a cross-nested logit model derived from the GEV class \n\nmore suitable to deal with cross similarities between different pure and combined \n\nmodes, allowing for differentiated measurement of pairwise similarities among modes. \n\nThe area of study is Tel Aviv, Israel, which is based primarily on two modes, \n\nautomobile and bus, however, planes are being made for the development of new, partly \n\ncompetitive and partly complementary, modes: suburban rail, light-rail transit and \n\nsubway. Vovsha criticizes two problems with standard nesting structure (transit and \n\nautomobile main nests, and further division of transit modes): (i) unambiguous \n\nidentification of the main transit leg for each combined trip and (ii) separation of local \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfeeder modes from trunk. One example where these assumptions are violated are the \n\npark-and-ride facilities where commuters can drive and park their cars near (or even \n\ninside) trunk transit stations, usually outside the central congested area. The dataset \n\ncomprises three surveys (1995 and 1996) for the morning peak hour travels in the Tel \n\nAviv metropolitan area: mode composition is about 70% automobile, 29% bus and 1% \n\nrail, however, for the Netanya-Tel Aviv corridor rail service is developed, accounting \n\nfor 10% of these trips. The deterministic portion of utility was comprised of mode-\n\nspecific constants, travel time and travel cost. Car ownership first segmented the trip \n\nmarkets into three groups (car captives, transit captives and mode choosers), then \n\n\u201cmain\u201d mode choices were automobile, bus, rail (three-legged, with bus/walking as first \n\nand third leg) and park-and-ride (three-legged, with automobile as first leg and \n\nbus/walking as third leg). Overall goodness of fit was relatively satisfactory and \n\ncoefficients were significant, except the cost variable: this can be explained by the \n\nnarrow range of automobile mode cost because of the absence of parking charges in \n\nobservations and by the narrow range of transit fares within the Tel Aviv metropolitan \n\narea. \n\n Bierlaire, Axhausen and Abbay (2001) explore stability of different model \n\napproaches to the SwissMetro transport data: Multinomial logit, MNL with non-linear \n\nutility function, nested logit and cross-nested logit. The SwissMetro is a survey which \n\nintends to forecast the demand for a magnetic levitation underground system operating \n\nat speeds up to 500km/h in partial vacuum connecting major Swiss conurbations. All \n\nthe models were estimated using the first author\u2019s software Biogeme, which can handles \n\nany type of GEV model. Contrary to most analysis whose data consists of stated \n\npreference (SP), this study is based on revealed preference (RP) sample road (770) and \n\nrail (435) users, which can be affected by the new mode. The variables in the utility \n\nfunction are the same for all modes: alternative specific constants, cost, time, age and \n\nfor transit the frequency, presence of luggage, seat configuration and the possession of \n\nannual season ticket. Looking at the log-likelihood value, there was a significant \n\nimprovement from the MNL to the NL model, and from the latter to the CNL model; \n\nthe value of time decreased across the MNL-NL-CNL models, from 1.2 to 1.15 to 1.12 \n\nsFr/min. \n\n Recent studies have been focusing increasingly in the NL models rather than the \n\nMNL ones, because the first model is more flexible regarding the IIA assumption: the \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nchoices in the same \u201cnest\u201d are allowed to be correlated, but not between nests. For \n\nexample, De Palma and Rochat (2000) estimated a NL model for the commute mode \n\nchoice in Geneva in which the first level the household chose between one or more than \n\none car (auto ownership) and at the bottom level it chose between private or transit \n\n(mode choice). \n\nDissanayake and Morikawa (2010) had an interesting methodological approach \n\nfor using both revealed and stated preference data. The stated preference data showed \n\nthe mode choices of transports already available, on the other side, the revealed \n\npreference was used for the Mass Rapid Transit System in Bangkok that would be \n\nimplemented in the following years. They estimated two models, the first, the \n\nbenchmark, is a NL with the RP, and the second is a NL with both RP and ST data, both \n\nof them had car ownership as the first level and mode choice at the bottom level. The \n\nsecond model performed better, showing more individually significant variables and a \n\nscale coefficient smaller than one and significant, according to the expectations. \n\n In regards to pricing policies and mode choice, Washbrook, Haider and Jaccard \n\n(2006) applied a questionnaire for people who currently drove alone to their \n\nworkplaces. They chose between drive alone, carpooling or a hypothetical express bus \n\nwhen choices varied in terms of time and cost attributed. Using this data, they calibrated \n\na Conditional Logit model for the Greater Vancouver suburb to estimate commuters\u2019 \n\nresponsiveness to various policies. They found that the most effective way to \n\ndisincentive single occupant vehicle choices is raising its cost, in other words, charging \n\nusers as a road pricing strategy. \n\n Vrtic et al. (2010) analyzed a revealed preference survey for four different \n\nchoices: one for political acceptability of road pricing and the other three (called \n\nbehavioral experiments) for joint car route and departure time choice (RDC), mode and \n\ndeparture time choice (MDC) and the third with mode and route choice (MRC), all in \n\nthe presence of road pricing. The questionnaires had 1,005 respondents from a sample \n\nof 2,290. They estimated a MNL model based on the joint datasets from the RDC, MDC \n\nand MRC experiments showed that, among other things, travelers resent more easily \n\navoidable costs more, such as parking that can be reduced by longer walking times and \n\ntolls that can be lessened by different routes and also that the Swiss commuters dislike \n\nearlier departure times, however, if choose to drive on a congested non tolled route, then \n\nthey prefer to depart earlier to make sure that they arrive on time or earlier. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The three following papers are quite similar in various aspects. Besides all the \n\nauthors being from the S\u00e3o Paulo University, all used the same data source \u2013 the 2007 \n\nMetr\u00f4 Survey; they all included work and education trips, running a different model for \n\neach purpose; they employed the same empirical methodology, multinomial and mixed \n\nlogit, and used the same independent variables (cost, time, income, age, sex, household \n\nsize and two dummy-variables for study and employment status). Also, they calculated \n\nthe travel cost (unobserved in the original Survey) exactly the same way. \n\n Lucinda, Meyer and Ledo (2013) study mode choice in the Metropolitan Region \n\nof S\u00e3o Paulo in order to estimate the welfare and traffic effects of a congestion charge. \n\nFirst, the authors discuss the experience of congestion charge in Singapore, London and \n\nStockholm and the current transport scenario in S\u00e3o Paulo. Then, they discuss the 2007 \n\nMetr\u00f4 Survey, presenting graphics about the departure/arrival time, mode share, mode \n\nshare for poor families and the importance of the Expanded Center region (S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s \n\nCBD). They show their calculation for the unobserved travel cost and also how they \n\nestimated the counterfactual trips (what would have been the travel time and cost for the \n\nmode snot chosen): they run two separate equations with a dependent variables as the \n\nlogarithm of the observed travel time and cost on dummy-variables for the departure \n\nand arrival times, trip purpose and distance; they only restricted train and subway for \n\nsome individuals\u2019 choice set. In the mixed logit, they found a VoTT of R$ 6.88 for \n\nwork-trips and also estimated that an expansion of the rotation scheme would lead to a \n\nlower welfare loss compared to the congestion charge. \n\n Barcellos (2014) studies mode choice in the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nin order to estimate the effect of a Tax over Fuel (the Fuels\u2019 Contribution of \n\nIntervention in the Economic Domain or CIDE in Portuguese) on the probability of the \n\ntravel mode choice. Using the 2007 Metr\u00f4 data and the mixed logit model results, the \n\nsimulation considers a tax of R$ 0.1 and R$ 0.5, in the first case, the automobile \n\nactually increases its mode share reducing transit\u2019s share, whereas in the second case, \n\nboth transit and automobile increase their share at the expanse of the non-motorized \n\nmodes. \n\n Pacheco and Chagas (2015) analyzed mode choice of the Metropolitan Region \n\nof S\u00e3o Paulo using the Metr\u00f4\u2019s 2007 Survey. Firstly, the authors discuss the role and \n\ncharacteristics of public roads and the difference between private and social costs. They \n\nestimated a multinomial mixed-effects logit model (it contains both a fixed effects and \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrandom effects, also known as random coefficients) with travel time and travel cost as \n\nwell as socioeconomic characteristics of the individual as explanatory variables \n\n(income, age, sex, if the person studies and if the person is employed). They grouped \n\nthe seventeen mode choices into six categories: non-motorized (walking and bicycle); \n\nbuses; rail (subway and train); motorcycle; automobile (driver and passenger); and taxi. \n\nThey estimated the same model (specification) for three different purposes of travel, \n\nfirst using the whole sample, second with work at the origin or destination and thirdly \n\nwith education at the origin or destination. The authors then move to a discussion of a \n\nflat congestion toll and its impact on the demand based on the derivatives of the cost \n\nvariables. \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY AND DATA \n\n \n\n 3.1. DATA \n\n \n\n The database used in the present research comes from various sources, but its \n\ncore is composed by the microdata from the transport surveys done by the Companhia \n\ndo Metropolitano de S\u00e3o Paulo8 (Metr\u00f4) in 2007 and 2012. Besides that, we also \n\ncollected monthly fuel prices from the Ag\u00eancia Nacional do Petr\u00f3leo, G\u00e1s Natural e \n\nBiocombust\u00edveis9 (ANP) and yearly vehicle mileage from the Instituto Nacional de \n\nMetrologia, Qualidade e Tecnologia10 (INMETRO). In this section, we will explain in \n\ndetail each dataset, especially those from Metr\u00f4. \n\n The surveys done by Metr\u00f4 are traditional sources of transport information about \n\nthe Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo (MRSP), Brazil. It was first implemented in 1967 \n\nfor the development of studies and projects for the initial subway network. Since then, \n\nthe survey has been carried out every 10 years (1977, 1987, 1997 and 2007), but since \n\n1997, intermediate surveys (2002 and 2012) are being executed to keep up with fast \n\nchanging dynamics of the city. Its primary goal is to identify the main daily trips of \n\npeople, by reason and mode of transportation. \n\n We used the transport data from Metr\u00f4 for several reasons. It is a complete \n\ndataset, with socio-economic and transport specific information, it is well documented \n\nand transparent (it contains the Household Research Manual, which explains each \n\nvariable in detail, the Code Manual, which contains the employment codes, the Zone \n\nMatching file, which provides information  about how the traffic zone codes changed \n\nfrom previous questionnaires) and it is statistically meaningful, it has a relatively large \n\nsample size, statistical weights and it is provided both as a dBase and a SAV file \n\nextension. Specifically, these two surveys, 2007 and 2012, were chosen for two main \n\nreasons. They are the most recent ones; therefore, they better portray the present reality \n\nof the region. Second, they are public, free-access and readily available for anyone \n\nwishing to download it, in Metr\u00f4 (2007) and Metr\u00f4 (2012). \n\n                                                           \n8 Company of the Metropolitan of S\u00e3o Paulo.

Website: http://www.inmetro.gov.br/ \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Both surveys are very similar in their three-block structure. The first block of \n\ninformation is about the household, its durable goods and socio-economic variables of \n\nthe residents. The second block informs the characteristics and localization of the \n\nschool, first and second jobs. The third has information about individual trips: which \n\nweekday; coordinates and traffic zone of origin, first, second and third transferences and \n\ndestination; purpose on origin/destination; departure and arrival time (hour and minute), \n\nmode choice, time walking at origin/destination, length and distance. Until four trips are \n\nrecorded per person. It is answered by everyone who took at least one trip the previous \n\nday. \n\n The official name of the 2007 Survey is Pesquisa Origem e Destino 2007 (here \n\nwe will refer to it simply as 2007 Survey). It raised information on 30 thousand \n\nrandomly chosen households and 120 thousand individuals distributed over 460 Traffic \n\nAnalysis Zones (TAZ), being 320 TAZ in the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality. The official name \n\nof the 2012 Survey is Pesquisa de Mobilidade da Regi\u00e3o Metropolitana de S\u00e3o Paulo \n\n2012 (here we will refer to it simply as 2012 Survey). It raised information on 8.1 \n\nthousand households and 32.4 thousand people distributed over 31 TAZ. \n\n It defines a series of concepts to standardize empirical analysis. Household is \n\nthe place of living of one or more families, a group or a single individual, it is limited \n\nby a wall and covered by a roof; a dweller is a family member, people who live in the \n\nhousehold most of the week, students and employees; a non-dweller is a military, \n\nstudent or worker who doesn\u2019t remain most of the week in the household, people who \n\nare there only visiting, traveling or doing business; a qualified respondent is every \n\ndweller in the household older than ten years old and capable of answering the \n\nquestions (the head of the house might answer for the incapable people older than ten), \n\nhowever, children younger than ten who go alone to school or work can answer; and a \n\ntrip is a movement between two points (an origin and a destination) with a defined \n\nreason, using one or more modes of transport, it is considered that the trip took place \n\nbetween 4 a.m. of a given day and 3:59 a.m. of the following day (24h period), the \n\ninformation about the trips are preferably about the previous day of the first visit to the \n\nhousehold and must be a workday (Monday to Friday) (METR\u00d4, 2007b; METR\u00d4, \n\n2012b). \n\n The 2007 and 2012 surveys consider an exhaustive (the last mode is \u201cothers\u201d, \n\nthat is, any mode which doesn\u2019t fit in any of the previous categories) mode choice set of \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nseventeen categories: bus from the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality; bus from other \n\nmunicipalities; intercity bus; chartered bus; school vehicle; driving a car; passenger of a \n\ncar; taxi (cab); microbus from the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality; microbus from other \n\nmunicipality; intercity microbus; subway (tube); train (rail); motorcycle; bicycle; \n\nwalking; and others. \n\n The walking mode has some special features. It is only considered as a sole \n\nmode when it is the only mode in the whole journey, that is, it never appears with \n\nanother mode. Trips whose reason is either work or school must always be recorded, \n\nregardless of the distance. For other reasons, walking trips are only registered if the \n\ndistance is over 5 blocks (approximately 500m). \n\n We collected monthly fuel information for each Brazilian State from the ANP, \n\nas previously discussed. The fuels surveyed are hydrous ethanol, regular gasoline (we \n\nwill refer to it simply as gasoline), liquefied/liquid petroleum gas (LPG or commonly \n\nreferred to as propane or butane), compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel fuel and diesel \n\nfuel S1011. They provide information about the number of stations surveyed, unit of \n\nmeasurement, average resale price, standard deviation of the resale price, \n\nminimum/maximum resale price, average resale margin, and the previous information \n\nabout the distribution price as well (ANP, 2012). We merged this information into the \n\nMetr\u00f4\u2019s dataset according to the year and month variables presented in both sources. \n\n We collected data about the energetic efficiency of light motor vehicles from the \n\nINMETRO. There is information about the vehicle category, brand/company, model, \n\nversion, engine, speed transmission, air conditioning, assisted steering, fuel, mileage \n\n(divided between urban and rural cycle and hydrous ethanol and gasoline) and the \n\nPrograma Brasileiro de Etiquetagem (PBE) fuel efficiency classification (which ranges \n\nfrom A as the lower consumption and E as the higher consumption) from 2009 to 2012. \n\nFrom 2013 to 2016, the INMETRO added the following information: exhaust emissions \n\n(non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide), \n\nenergetic consumption (in MJ/km), a new PBE 2013 classification and the presence of \n\nthe Programa Nacional da Racionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do Uso dos Derivados do Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s \n\nNatural (CONPET) Seal of Energetic Efficiency 2013. \n\n                                                           \n11 Diesel fuel with a 10 mg/kg maximum sulfur limit, as defined by the National Council on the \n\nEnvironment, CONAMA, issued resolution 403/2008. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 3.2. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY \n\n \n\n This section covers all empirical procedures of the work. Since the data pre-\n\nprocessing, travel time estimation, cost calculation and model specification. All the \n\nfollowing data adjustments and statistical analysis were carried out using the software \n\nStata 11.2/SE - StataCorp (2009a) \u2013 unless otherwise stated and we shall follow their \n\nterminology throughout the work. All Stata code will be fully available at a public \n\nrepository called \u201cMsc. thesis\u201d in the author\u2019s GitHub page (https://github.com/jayme-\n\nanchante). \n\n \n\n 3.2.1. Data pre-processing \n\n \n\n Both 2007 and 2012 Metr\u00f4 databases were appended totalizing 250,203 \n\nobservations (196,698 from 2007 and 53,505 from 2012). For practical reasons, some \n\nchanges were made. Some variables that appeared only in 2007 were excluded: \n\n\u201ccondmora\u201d (housing condition: owned, rented, ceded or other); \u201cqt_micro\u201d (number of \n\nmicrocomputers in the household); \u201cpag_viag\u201d (who paid for the trip: oneself/family, \n\nemployer, exempted or other); \u201ctp_esauto\u201d (the kind of parking for automobile: didn\u2019t \n\npark, paid public parking, sponsored, own parking lot, public free parking, one-time \n\nparking or monthly parking); \u201cvl_est\u201d (the value paid for the parking); \u201cpe_bici\u201d (why \n\nhave you traveled on foot or on bicycle: short distance, other modes were expensive, far \n\nbus stop, infrequent transit, long trip, crowded transit, physical activity or other \n\nreasons); and \u201ctp_esbici\u201d (the kind of parking for bicycle: free bicycle parking, paid \n\nbicycle parking, private place, public place or other). Also, the variable \u201ctotal individual \n\nincome\u201d can take up to different values depending on the year: six-digit for 2012 and \n\neight-digit for 2007, however, no income higher than 6-digit appears in either survey. A \n\nproper day, month and year variables were created based on the \u201cdata\u201d variable (the day \n\nthe interview took place in the household).  \n\n For the next paragraphs, we numbers in parenthesis are the total number of \n\nobservations excluded because of the stated reason. We checked the dataset to find \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\npossible logical inconsistencies and/or typing errors. Some observations (148) were \n\ndated prior to 2007, from 1982 and 1999 and some didn\u2019t show any date at all (175). \n\nThe day the trip took place took values from \u201c2\u201d (Monday) to \u201c6\u201d (Friday); however, \n\nvalues \u201c0\u201d were found (457). People could travel from or to outside the researched area \n\n(MRSP) and it is foreseen in the Survey Manual (METR\u00d4, 2007b; METR\u00d4, 2012b). \n\nThe code of the workplace municipality should range from 1 to 39, according to the \n\nCode Manual, however values \u201c99\u201d appeared as first work (570) and second work (25). \n\nSome observations also didn\u2019t record information on distances traveled (194). \n\n For methodological reasons, some changes were made. People who had no \n\nrecorded trips were excluded (33,427). This is due to the tautology of the problem: one \n\ncannot study trips that didn\u2019t happen. Again, we kept observations of people who went \n\nfrom home to work (home-work based trips) as trip motives, leading us to exclude \n\n170,097 observations. There are several reasons for this narrowing: i) basically all \n\nworks on the mode choice literature use a dataset consisting of morning commute trips; \n\nii) other-purpose trips have a different set of explanatory variables, such as convenience, \n\ndestination characteristics, etc; iii) and from the point of view of the public policy, \n\nother-purpose trips are not as important as home-work trips, because each purpose \n\naccounts for a small portion of traffic and those trips are more flexible, especially the \n\ndeparture/arrival time and location (on the contrary, most jobs start at around 8 a.m. and \n\nare located in the Central Business Center). We also kept only the trips that begin and \n\nend in the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality (12,853 observations dropped), because it is not \n\nfeasible to estimate intercity bus fare, which is better explained later on, when we \n\ndiscuss how we created the cost variable. \n\n Other exclusions include: persons which choose the \u201cother\u201d category for mode \n\nof transportation (41), since we cannot precise what mode it really is; persons which \n\nchoose buses from municipalities other than S\u00e3o Paulo (6); persons which choose \n\nmicrobuses from municipalities other than S\u00e3o Paulo (7); persons which choose \n\nintercity microbuses (10); households which did not declare their comfort items (29); if \n\nthe number of automobiles in the household (\u201cqt_auto\u201d is the name of the variable in the \n\ndataset) is a missing (481); if the number of bicycles in the household (\u201cqt_bicicle\u201d is \n\nthe name of the variable in the dataset) is a missing (1); if the Traffic Analysis Zone \n\n(TAZ) of the first work is a missing (1260). We excluded extreme values (even though \n\nthey might represent the behavior of the population), because those values were thought \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto be erroneous and/or far from the reality in some form. For example, non-motorized \n\nspeeds over 200 km/h or general commutes longer than 10h, our arbitrarily chosen \n\nmeasure were values lower than the 5th and higher than 95th percentiles of distance, time \n\nand speed variables for each mode, which resulted in 3,708 observations excluded. The \n\nfinal dataset consisted of 26,797 observations, 21,186 belonging to the 2007 Metr\u00f4 \n\nSurvey and 5,611 belonging to the 2012 Survey. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Estimating the urban gasoline mileage based on the automobile\u2019s year \n\nof manufacture \n\n \n\n Both 2007 and 2012 Metr\u00f4\u2019s Surveys present the number of automobiles per \n\nhousehold as well as the year of manufacture of three of them12. There is no other \n\ninformation regarding the category, brand, model, type of engine, transmission and \n\nother characteristics of the vehicle which could ultimately lead to an accurate estimation \n\nof the vehicle mileage. Moreover, we can\u2019t tell what is the year of the automobile used \n\non the trip made by this mode, so we will assume that the trip is always made in the \n\nautomobile stated in the variable whose dictionary name is \u201cANO_AUTO1\u201d which is \n\nthe \u201cyear of manufacture \u2013 Auto 1\u201d or the vehicle with the latest manufacture year. \n\n Furthermore, we collected data from the INMETRO website which provides \n\nofficial government information on vehicle mileage for gasoline/diesel and hydrous \n\nethanol in rural and urban areas (we are going to use solely gasoline mileage in urban \n\nareas). However, information is only available for vehicles manufactured between 2009 \n\nand 2016. We downloaded the available archives as Portable Document Format (.pdf \n\nextension) and using the services of two websites13 we converted the files to Microsoft \n\nExcel Worksheet (.xlsx extension), manually appending and correcting the spreadsheets. \n\nSince the volume of information was enormous, we selected only vehicles whose \n\ncategory was either Subcompact (defined as passenger vehicles with area until 6.5 m2, \n\n+/- 0.1 m2) or Compact (defined as passenger vehicles with area from 6.5 to 7 m2, +/- \n\n                                                           \n12 There is no information about the criteria for defining which are these three vehicles and in which \norder they are going to be reported, that is, if it is ordered by intensity of use, date of acquisition, date of \nmanufacture, price or other. However, a simple inspection reveals that it follows a decreasing order of the \nyear of manufacture, that is, the first car to be reported is the latest manufacture year. \n13 Nitro software online (https://www.pdftoexcelonline.com/en/) for pdfs from 2009 to 2012 and \npdftoexcel.com (http://www.pdftoexcel.com/) for pdfs from 2013 to 2016. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.1 m2) as proxies for an average commuting vehicle. We could use each year\u2019s average \n\nmileage to merge into the Metr\u00f4\u2019s surveys; however, there are many automobiles in the \n\nMetr\u00f4\u2019s dataset which were manufactured prior 2009, as we can see from the following \n\ntable: \n\n \n\nTable 1: Year of manufacture of the first automobile in 2007 and 2012 Metr\u00f4's Surveys \n\nYear Frequency Percent Cumulated \nPrior 2009 17,321 90.89 90.89 \n\n2009 264 1.39 92.28 \n2010 493 2.59 94.86 \n2011 480 2.52 97.38 \n2012 445 2.34 99.72 \n2013 54 0.28 100 \nTotal 19,057 100 \n\n Source: elaborated by the author \n\n \n\n Our method to overcome this data gap (mileage prior 2009) relies on one \n\nreasonable assumption: each passing year, vehicles become more efficient in terms of \n\nmileage (or for our purpose we can think backwards: each previous year automobiles \n\nwere less efficient in terms of mileage). This is assumption seems to hold for the \n\nINMETRO dataset as we can see from the following bar graphic showing average \n\nmileage for each year. We can argue that this assumption might hold in the \u201creal world\u201d \n\nif we think that as time passes, technology improves, and as technology improves, new \n\nfuel efficient engines are created, car body becomes lighter and other aspects are \n\nimproved, implicitly \u201ctime is making mileage increases\u201d. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 5: Mean gasoline mileage over year (2009-2016), sub-compact and compact \nvehicle categories \n\n \n\n Therefore, our objective is to estimate if and how much time affects automobile \n\nmileage. To fulfill our objective, we ran a dummy variable fixed effects model with a \n\ndeterministic trend. We also included two other variables besides these those.  \n\nAccording to the INMETRO (2009-2016) methodology, the reference values of models\u2019 \n\nmileage14 were tested with the optional air conditioning and assisted steering, as \n\nindicated. So, we included in the model a dummy variable for the presence of air \n\nconditioner (with value equal to \u201c1\u201d indicating the presence of air conditioner and \u201c0\u201d \n\notherwise) and dummy variables for each type of assisted steering (electric, \n\nelectrohydraulic, hydraulic and mechanic). We grouped the individual variable by \n\nbrand/company and model (totalizing 61 automobiles/individuals). We are primarily \n\ninterested in the coefficient of the deterministic trend which tells us how much the \n\nmileage increases with each passing year. \n\n                                                           \n14 According to the INMETRO methodology (INMETRO, 2017), the reference values are obtained from \n\nconsumption measures performed in laboratory according to the NBR 7024 standards. To approximate \n\nthe its values to those perceived by actual drivers, the INMETRO adopted the same adjustment factors \n\nas the United States Environment Protection Agency. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Estimating the effect of time on vehicular gasoline consumption \n\n  \nVARIABLES Gasoline mileage (city) \n  \nDeterministic trend 0.1367*** \n (0.01566) \nAir conditioning -0.8113*** \n \nAssisted steering: \n \n\n(0.08282) \n\nelectrohydraulic 0.6406** \n (0.2769) \nhydraulic -0.6359*** \n (0.2089) \nmechanic -0.2623 \n\n (0.1866) \nConstant -263.55*** \n (31.577) \n  \nObservations 822 \nR-squared 0.710 \nFixed effects Yes \n\nAssisted steering base category: electric \n\nt statistics in parentheses \nSource: elaborated by the author \n\n* p &lt;0.05, ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001 \n \n\n As we can see from the table above, the variables were significant (except one of \n\nthe assisted steering dummies). The model\u2019s goodness-of-fit represented by the \n\ncoefficient of determination (R-squared) is relatively high, that is, 71% of the variance \n\nof the dependent variable, gasoline mileage, is explained by the model. In particular, the \n\ndeterministic trend was significant at the 1% level and we can interpret it as time \n\nincreases by one year, gasoline mileage increases, in average, by 0.1367 km/l, holding \n\nother variables constant. Using this estimate, we can now fill in the missing values for \n\nthe mileage of cars manufactured prior 2009. For the manufacture years prior 1970, we \n\ntreated mileage as being equal to the year of 1970, which is 5.5658 km/l, otherwise \n\nvalues would be nearly zero for the oldest manufactured automobiles (1920 is the oldest \n\nautomobile in the dataset). Also, there were 94 cases where the year of the first \n\nautomobile is missing, even though the household had at least one item, so we replaced \n\nthose missing observations by the sample median of the year of the manufacture of the \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfirst automobile, which was 2002 for the 2007 Survey and 2007 for the 2012 Survey. \n\nWe also used the automobile median to generate the year of manufacture of the \n\nmotorcycles and twice the respective auto mileage. \n\n \n\n 3.2.3. Counterfactual travel times estimation \n\n \n\n The structure of the dataset that we currently have is one observation (one row) \n\nfor each individual, that is, we have information about the observed or actual choice; \n\nhowever, we need to have or to estimate the counterfactual scenarios, that is, what \n\nwould have happen had the individual chosen a different mode to commute. The \n\nfollowing two tables exemplify what we are explaining. Table 3 displays three \n\nindividuals, the first one choose private mode, the second transit and the third a non-\n\nmotorized mode, each one with their own characteristics. However, we should note that \n\nthe time and cost variables are attributes of the alternatives, whereas sex and age are \n\ncharacteristics of the individuals. Table 4 displays three rows per individual, each row \n\nshows a different mode choice, noting that each individual chose the same mode as the \n\nprevious table (given by the Choice column), for the same individual, each mode has a \n\ndifferent time and cost, nonetheless, sex and age (as well as other socio-demographic \n\ncharacteristics) remain constant for the same individual. \n\n \n\nTable 3: Observed Metr\u00f4\u2019s data structure \n\nPerson_id Mode Time Cost Sex Age \n1 Private 20 5 Male 30 \n2 Transit 45 3 Female 25 \n3 Non-motorized 30 0 Male 20 \n\nSource: elaborated by the author \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4: Observed Metr\u00f4\u2019s data structure with mode choice counterfactuals \n\nPerson_id Mode Choice Time Cost Sex Age \n1 Private 1 20 5 Male 30 \n1 Transit 0 30 2 Male 30 \n1 Non-motorized 0 45 0 Male 30 \n2 Private 0 15 2 Female 25 \n2 Transit 1 45 3 Female 25 \n2 Non-motorized 0 60 0 Female 25 \n3 Private 0 20 4 Male 20 \n3 Transit 0 25 3 Male 20 \n3 Non-motorized 1 30 0 Male 20 \n\nSource: elaborated by the author \n \n\n Our next task is \u201ccreating\u201d the counterfactual mode choices. Our assumption is \n\nthat people remember more accurately their origin and destination points (since during \n\nthe interview, interviewees only need to answer the address of each location and can \n\ncite references, like gas stations, supermarkets, based on that information the data \n\nprocess stage will fill the latitude and longitude coordinates, which decreases recalling \n\nerror) than at what time they departure and arrived at such locations. Given that, instead \n\nof trying to estimate directly the travel times, our strategy is to estimate the average \n\nspeed - the ratio between distance and time \u2013 regressing each mode\u2019s speed on \n\nindividual characteristics. \n\n We initially made a visual inspection of histograms for each mode (transit, \n\nprivate and non-motorized), as well as distributions between different modes intra-\n\ncategory, also varying between Surveys and other variables. We also performed various \n\nmultivariate tests of means to see whether mean speed differed between transit, private \n\nand non-motorized options (intra-category differences). For transit options, we rejected \n\nthe hypothesis that they all have the same sample mean (assuming homogeneity and \n\nallowing for heterogeneity), however, since estimating different travel times for each \n\ntransit option would require to know if the person lives near a bus, a subway and/or a \n\ntrain station, we will assume that all transit options are part of a \u201cunified\u201d system of \n\ntransit, which have the same mean speed, and all person have access to that system. For \n\nprivate options, we rejected the hypothesis that all sample means are the same; however, \n\nif we exclude \u201cmotorcycle\u201d from the test, we didn\u2019t reject the hypothesis, since it holds \n\na fairly small mode share among private modes, we accepted the hypothesis that the \n\nsample mean for private modes are the same. For non-motorized modes, we rejected the \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhypothesis that walking and cycling have the same sample mean, but we did not reject \n\nthe hypothesis that walking/cycling mean speed differ from the two Surveys, since we \n\ncannot observe the person\u2019s ability of cycling, we are assuming that everyone (has the \n\nability of walking and) chooses walking as non-motorized mode. \n\n There isn\u2019t any literature regarding specifically the prediction of transit speeds \n\nand there is no demographic variable that can explain it per se. However, we can think \n\nabout the transit speed as the sum of two speeds: the speed of the individual while \n\nwalking to/from a station and the speed of the vehicle itself. For the \u201cfirst\u201d speed, we \n\nincluded as explanatory variables age and sex variable as in the non-motorized speed \n\nregression (latter explained). For the \u201csecond\u201d speed, we included variables that could \n\nindicate the effect of time and space over the vehicle speed: the day of the week \n\n(Weekday dummy variables, equal to \u201c3\u201d if the trip occurs on a Tuesday, \u201c4\u201d if the trip \n\noccurs on a Wednesday and so on, the base category is Monday), the departure hour \n\n(ranging from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c23\u201d, since early departure should avoid the rush hour and supply \n\nof vehicles might also change depending on the time of the day) and dummy variables \n\nfor each origin TAZ. Since the latter variable is different for the 2007 and the 2012 \n\nSurveys, we estimated a different regression for each survey. The following table \n\ndisplays the regression of transit speed on explanatory variables for the 2007 and 2012 \n\nSurveys. We can see that age and sex variables had the same sign as the non-motorized \n\nspeed regression, which is the expected, as people get older they tend to walk slower \n\nand also males walk faster than females. For the weekday dummies, all days seem to \n\naffect positively the speed compared to Monday and this relationship is even stronger \n\non Friday. The latter the departure hour, the faster the transit speed, contrary to what \n\ncould be expected (latter departures might face more congestion of the rush hour); \n\nhowever, a possible explanation might be the fact that commutes by transit tend leave \n\nhome earlier (because transit is less reliable than a motor private mode, for example), \n\nand the earlier in the day, the lower the public transportation fleet provision (and higher \n\nthe time waiting). All variables were individually significant and the R-squared was \n\nhigher than we expected, since we are estimating transit speed without a proper \n\nestablished theory. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5: Estimating average transit speed for each Metr\u00f4 Survey \n\n 2007 Survey 2012 Survey \nAge -0.0060 -0.0095 \n (0.0047) (0.0066) \nSex 0.1784 0.3315* \n (0.1164) (0.1578) \nMonday 0.0000 0.0000 \n (.)

There \n\nare, however, some papers on driving behavior and individual characteristics, especially \n\nsex and gender. For example, Rhodes and Pivik (2011) applied a phone survey in the \n\nstate of Alabama on 504 teens and 409 adults showed a riskier driving behavior for teen \n\nand male than for adult and female drivers.  \u00d6zkan and Lajunen (2006) investigated the \n\ndifferences between sex and gender on driving skills and accident involvement among \n\nyoung drivers. Reasoning as we did on the transit speed regression, the private \n\nmotorized speed can be described as the sum of two factors: the behavior of the \n\nindividual driver and speed of the vehicle itself. Regarding the \u201cfirst\u201d speed, we \n\nincluded socio-demographic characteristics:  age, sex, number of family dwellers, \n\nfamily income (nominal R$) and employment relationship (base category is formal \n\ncontract). For the \u201csecond\u201d speed\u201d, we used the day of the week, the departure hour and \n\ndummy variable for each origin TAZ. The following table displays the results of the \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nregression of transit speed on the previous explanatory variables for the 2007 and 2012 \n\nSurveys. Age had an inverse relationship with private speed whereas males, on average, \n\nhad a higher speed than females, which is our a priori expectation, since elder people \n\nmight be more conservative than young people in this respect and males might assume a \n\nriskier driving behavior than females. The number of family dwellers also showed a \n\nnegative relationship with private speed; people who live alone might have a riskier \n\nbehavior than parents with children or couples living with other relatives. Income had a \n\npositive relationship with speed, we think about income being positively related to more \n\npowerful (engine power) cars and a household located near major (and faster) highways. \n\nAll employment relationship had a lower speed than the formal contract (base category), \n\nit might be the case that formal contractors could have a stiffer arriving time. The \n\nweekday dummies had varies relationships with the base category, Monday. The \n\ndeparture time had a negative relationship with speed, this could mean that latter \n\ndeparture might face more congestion. All variables were individually significant and \n\noverall goodness of fit was higher than expected. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6: Estimating average private speed for each Metr\u00f4 Survey \n\n 2007 Survey 2012 Survey \nAge -0.0363*** -0.0031 \n (0.0086) (0.0134) \nSex 0.8846*** 1.1292*** \n (0.2139) (0.3366) \nFamily_dwellers -0.0999 0.0395 \n (0.0803) (0.1248) \nFamily_income 0.0000 -0.0000 \n (0.0000) (0.0000) \nFormal contract 0.0000 0.0000 \n (.)

For example, Murray et al. (1966) \n\nemployed a photographic method for recording simultaneously the displacements which \n\noccur in walking, studying the gait pattern of sixty men. The patterns for fast speed \n\nwalking had a mean of 7.848 km/h and a standard deviation of 0.9, while free speed had \n\na mean of 5.436 km/h and a standard deviation of 0.72. Also, younger men (20-25 years \n\nold) walked significantly faster than the older men, taking the longest strides in the \n\nshortest time, while older men (60-65 years old) tended to take the shortest strides. \n\nHeight also influenced the stride length, showing the greatest magnitude for the tall \n\nsubjects and the least for the short subjects. All of the displacement patterns, except the \n\nstride width and the foot angles, were notably similar for repeated walking trials of the \n\nindividual subjects. Murray, Kory and Clarkson (1969) continue the previous study by \n\nextending the upper limits of the age range to 87 to test whether a \"presenile\" walking \n\npattern is consistent and progressive with advanced age. Sixty-four \u201cnormal\u201d men \n\n(normal strength and range of motion) in age groups from 20 to 87 years were recorded \n\nby interrupted-light photography. Free speed mean was 5.004 km/h with a standard \n\ndeviation of 0.828 whereas fast speed mean was 7.02 km/h with a standard deviation of \n\n1.44. Again, walking speed of the men in the three oldest age groups was significantly \n\nlower than that of the younger men for both their free and fast speed walking trials. \n\n Given the previous works, age, sex and weight are the standard variables for \n\nexplaining walking speed. Since we did not reject the hypothesis that cycling and \n\nwalking had different mean speeds and cycling holds a small mode share, we treated \n\ncycling and walking as the same mode. Since we do not observe the individual\u2019s \n\nweight, we regressed the average non-motorized speed on age (years) and sex (\u201c1\u201d for \n\nmale and \u201c0\u201d for females). We found a negative relationship between speed and age and \n\nmales had a higher speed than females. Both individual t-tests rejected the hypothesis \n\nthat the coefficients are equal to zero at 1% significance, although the coefficient of \n\ndetermination (the r-squared) resulted smaller than we expected. \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 7: Estimating average non-motorized speed for both Surveys \n\n Speed \nAge -0.0112** \n (0.0037) \nSex 0.3063** \n (0.1045) \nConstant 3.4854*** \n (0.1554) \nObservations 5,736 \nR2 0.0073 \n\nStandard errors in parentheses \n\nSource: elaborated by the author \n* p &lt;0.05, ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001 \n\n \n\n Estimating the counterfactuals also implies that we are estimating the \n\nindividual\u2019s choice set and most likely not all alternatives might be available to all \n\nindividuals. For transit and private counterfactuals, we reasoned that if the distance is \n\ntoo small, the commuter would never choose to go on these modes. We calculated the \n\n1th percentile of the distance for the observed commuters by transit (1.72km) and private \n\n(0.63km) modes, and excluded those counterfactual alternatives for individuals whose \n\ndistances were smaller than those values, which resulted in dropping 7,009 observations \n\nfor transit counterfactuals and 3,226 observations for private counterfactuals. We used \n\nthe same reasoning for non-motorized counterfactuals, but thinking that if the distance \n\nwas too large, the commuter would never choose this mode. We calculated the 99th \n\npercentile of the distance for the observed commuters by non-motorized modes \n\n(2.78km) and excluded these counterfactual alternatives for individuals whose distances \n\nwere bigger than this value, which resulted in dropping 17,057 observations for non-\n\nmotorized counterfactuals. \n\n Continuing about the choice set generation; we assumed that every commuter \n\nhad non-motorized and transit as a counterfactual (after excluding the extreme distance \n\nimpediments). However, for the private counterfactual we had to look the household\u2019s \n\nvehicles to see whether a private mode is feasible. We assumed that commuters whose \n\nhousehold had at least one automobile could and would commute by auto as a \n\ncounterfactual. We also assumed that commuters whose household had at least one \n\nmotorcycle could and would commute by motorcycle, if they haven\u2019t already chosen \n\nauto as counterfactual. Commuters whose household did not have neither automobiles \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nnor motorcycles could, in theory, commute by taxi; however, this may not be feasible, \n\nsince in the original dataset we only observe 148 taxi commutes or 1.44% of the private \n\nmode share, which is much less than the 6,653 commuters whose household does not \n\nhave neither an auto nor a motorcycle. Keeping the private share equal to the observed \n\ndata, we should have around 192 taxi trips as counterfactuals, since we cannot estimate \n\nthe probability of choosing taxi over other private modes, we randomly assigned 192 \n\ntaxi trips for commuters whose household does not have neither an auto nor a \n\nmotorcycle as draws from a binomial distribution with one trial (n equal to one) and \n\nprobability of success, p, equal to 0.03. We excluded the private counterfactuals for \n\ncommuters whose household did not have neither automobiles nor motorcycles and the \n\nones that weren\u2019t assigned the \u201cpossibility\u201d of commuting by taxi, resulting in the \n\nexclusion of 5,451 counterfactuals. \n\n After estimating each mode\u2019s speed (in the case of transit and private categories \n\nfor different Surveys as well), we divided the observed (reported) distance by the \n\nestimated speed for each individual, generating a new variable for the travel time. As \n\nalready discussed previously, since observed travel times tend to be rounded up in sharp \n\ntimes (because of reported departure/arrival times), we decided to use the estimated \n\ntravel time not only for the counterfactual travel times, but also for the actually chosen \n\nmodes, because our estimated turned out to be more evenly distributed around those \n\nsharp times, with spikes less accentuated. We did not follow the previous general rule \n\nfor two cases: the speed differences between automobiles and motorcycles and walking \n\nand bicycling. In the observed data, motorcycles had a mean speed 3.89km/h higher \n\nthan automobiles whereas cycling had a mean speed 2.31km/h higher than walking. We \n\nalready discussed who commuted by motorcycle as counterfactual, a different and \n\nharder task would be who would cycle rather than walk in their non-motorized \n\ncounterfactual: we can observe whether the commuter has at least one bicycle in their \n\nhousehold, however we cannot observe whether he or she has the ability to pedal. In the \n\nobserved dataset, we had 201 people commuting by bicycle or 3.5% of the non-\n\nmotorized mode share; an equivalent share in the non-motorized counterfactual would \n\nbe around 140 cycle commutes. As in the case of taxi, we randomly assigned the \n\npossibility of commuters who had at least one bicycle in their households to cycle as \n\ndraws from a binomial distribution with one trial (n equal to one) and probability of \n\nsuccess, p, equal to 0.08. Motorcyclists and cyclists had an estimated travel time equal \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto their distance divided by the estimated speed plus 3.89 km/h for motorcyclists or plus \n\n2.31 km/h for cyclists. \n\n The next figure displays the observed and estimated travel times: the first \n\ncolumn shows transit travel times; the second, private; and the third, the non-motorized. \n\nThe first row shows the observed travel times (what we had in our \u201coriginal\u201d dataset); \n\nthe second row shows the travel times for those same modes as they were estimated by \n\nour models; and the third row shows the travel times for the counterfactuals, that is, the \n\nmodes that weren\u2019t actually chosen by the commuters and that we also estimated. We \n\ncan perceive in the first row how observed travel times show large spikes around sharp \n\ntimes and has small mass between those spikes. The second column shows more even \n\ndistributions, however, they all share a trend to be right/positive skewed, maybe that is a \n\nsign that our models overestimated the speeds, resulting in lower travel times. This \n\ntrend is even more evident in the third row for transit and private modes, which were \n\nmore right-skewed: this may be due to the fact that those low travel times are the \n\ncounterfactuals of non-motorized trips, which tend to be shorter, and since transit and \n\nprivate display higher speeds, this (dividing a shorter distance by a higher speed) result \n\nin lower travel times. Non-motorized column in the third row, on the contrary, seem to \n\nbe a little left-skewed: since it is the counterfactual of the other modes and it has a lower \n\nspeed, it results in higher travel times. We will continue to deal with our counterfactual \n\nchoice set generating as we move on to the cost estimating. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Observed and estimated sample distribution of travel times by mode \n\n \n\n 3.2.4.

The bus from the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality fare is stipulated in R$ 2.3 for \n\n2007/2008 and R$ 3 for 2012, (SPTRANS, 2017), it should be noted that students only \n\npay half fare (this is valid for all forms of public transportation, subway and train \n\nincluded) as defined by the local law, (SPTRANS, 2017). For buses from other \n\nmunicipalities and inter-city buses we first checked the Empresa Metropolitana de \n\nTransportes Urbanos de S\u00e3o Paulo S. A. website (EMTU, 2017) to retrieve the intercity \n\nbus fare. There were 6,150 different fares depending on your consortium, type of \n\nservice, line, section/integration, extension and road toll for the year of 2017 and the \n\nMetropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo. Added to this, the fact that there is no exact \n\ninformation about the route or the coordinates of the origin/destination and that there is \n\nno fare information prior 2015, it is infeasible to estimate the fare cost for intercity \n\ntravels. Since this mode accounts for approximately 13% of intercity travels, we decided \n\nto keep in the analysis only trips whose origin and destination are the municipality of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo (after doing this, it still remained 6 observations which used buses from other \n\nmunicipalities, we excluded them). We also assumed that the cost for chartered bus is \n\nthe same as the public buses. \n\n Automobile cost was calculated according to the equation 24. It is composed \n\nsolely of fuel expenses, which may be an oversimplification, because we did not \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\naccount for other important costs like insurance, depreciation, parking, maintenance and \n\ntaxes, however, drivers only perceive their marginal cost for short term decisions, which \n\nis fuel cost, once all other costs are paid (most occur only once at the begin/end of each \n\nyear). So, auto cost is the ratio between the distance (straight line between origin and \n\ndestination, in kilometers) and mileage (in kilometers per liter of gasoline), multiplied \n\nthe price of one liter of gasoline in the month the trip took place (which is an \n\ninformation available at the Metr\u00f4\u2019s Surveys), prices collected in the ANP (2012). \n\nMileage is not observed in the Metr\u00f4 dataset, instead we estimated its average by the \n\nyear of manufacture. Since motorcycle year of manufacture was not observed either, we \n\nassumed that it was the median of the year of auto manufacture for each Survey, which \n\nis 2002 for the 2007 Survey and 2007 for the 2012 Survey, and that motorcycle mileage \n\nis twice the value of auto mileage in the same years. \n\n \n\n = ?? / \u00d7 $/                              (28) \n \n\n Taxi fare is defined by law, as a fixed R$ 3.5 plus \u201c2.1\u201d times the distance \n\ntraveled, S\u00e3o Paulo (2006), and as a fixed R$ 4.1 plus \u201c2.5\u201d times the distance, S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo (2010). Motorcycle cost was also estimated using equation 24, however, it is half \n\nthe auto cost, because we are assuming the motorcycles are around twice as fuel \n\nefficient as automobiles. \n\n For the microbuses, we are also assuming that they follow the same law as the \n\npublic buses. Subway and train fares are also defined by the same law as buses and they \n\nhave the same tariffs. Thus, we are assuming that all transit alternatives have the same \n\ncost, according to the Survey and if the commuter is a student or not. \n\n Finally, cycling and walking pose no monetary cost to the commuter, so their \n\ncost is assumed to be zero. If we think marginally, as we did in the auto cost, this may \n\nbe true; however, the global cost of walking and cycling is certainly not zero, if walking \n\nthe person needs special clothing for some kinds of weathers or an umbrella if it is \n\nraining and if cycling the person needs a bicycle, which is also may need some kind of \n\nmaintenance, parking facilities and proper clothing and accessories. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Next two tables provide the summary statistics for cost and time variables for the \n\n2007 and 2012 Surveys, respectively. Sample mean of both cost and time is higher for \n\ntransit than private; and higher for private than cost, for both Surveys. Contrary to most \n\nworks, where there is a clear trade-off between cost and time: faster commutes usually \n\nresult in higher costs, in our dataset transit is both more time consuming and more \n\nexpensive than private modes. There are some possible explanations for this \n\nphenomenon: i) a direct effect is the government subsidy for the gasoline through its \n\nmonopolistic company Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S. A. (Petrobras); ii) and an indirect effect \n\nbeing the Downs-Thomson paradox taken place in the practice, as the private vehicle \n\nreal prices are actually declining due to heavy subsidizing, it shifts people from public \n\ntransportation towards private transportation, increasing the fare as the system cost is \n\nbeared by less users; and iii) the way we created the private cost, we only took into \n\nconsideration the gasoline costs, not the other various direct and indirect cost of both \n\nowning and using a private motorized mode. We can also note that, despite non-\n\nmotorized modes being in practice slower (in terms of speed) than both transit and \n\nprivate, their travel times is, on average, lower than the other two modes. This can only \n\nbe explained by the fact the distance commuted by non-motorized modes are smaller, \n\nthat is, people live near their work or work near where they live. As most works, the \n\nstandard deviation of transit travel times was higher than private travel times for both \n\nSurveys: a simple interpretation might be that transit is a less reliable mode than private \n\nand non-motorized, which has a practical explanation, since the transit user does not \n\ncontrol the schedule and the route of this mode. Lastly, we can note that, although we \n\ncreated a sample around 15-20% the size of the original dataset for each Survey, the \n\nsample still account for almost 6 million trips for the 2007 Survey and 6.7 million trips \n\nfor 2012. \n\n \n\nTable 9: Summary statistics of Cost (R$) and Time (h) variables for the 2007 Survey \n\n Summary of Cost Summary of Time   \nMode Mean Std.

Model specification \n\n \n\n First of all, let us define our dependent variable, the choice of mode of transport. \n\nThe respondents in the Metr\u00f4\u2019s Surveys may choose among an exhaustive choice set of \n\nseventeen options considered by the questionnaire: bus from the S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nmunicipality, bus from other municipalities, intercity bus, chartered bus, school vehicle, \n\ndriving a car, passenger of a car, taxi (cab), microbus from the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality, \n\nmicrobus from other municipality, intercity microbus, subway (tube), train (rail), \n\nmotorcycle, bicycle, walking and others, as shown in the first column of Table 11. \n\n We turned the seventeen modes of transport into three broad categories: Transit \n\n(1), Private (2) and Non-motorized (3), which is demonstrated in the second column of \n\nTable 11. This aggregation followed our subjective judgment based on the modes\u2019 \n\ninherent characteristics. Transit comprises all public-access mass transportation whose \n\nitinerary is not fully under the user control, namely bus from the S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nmunicipality, chartered bus, microbus from the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality, subway and \n\ntrain. Private includes all forms of motorized private means: driving a car, passenger of \n\na car, taxi and motorcycle. Non-motorized, also called active transportation, are all \n\nmeans that require active participation of the traveler: walk and bicycle. Taxi is perhaps \n\nthe most hard to label, it could be both private or transit. Its price is established by law \n\nand it is heavily regulated as other transit options; however, we opted to mark it as \n\nprivate to its cost structure similar to the other private means and also because the user \n\nhas full control over the itinerary of the travel. The cost structure reason applies \n\ngenerally to all classifications, all transit options share (or were \u201cforced\u201d to share) the \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsame cost structure as the private and non-motorized. Modes classified in none of the \n\nthree categories are bus and microbus from other municipalities, intercity bus and \n\nmicrobus for reasons already discussed in the section 3.2.4., school vehicle resulted in \n\nno trips because we are study commute trips only and the others category is excluded \n\nbecause we can\u2019t specify exactly what mode of transportation it is and because it has a \n\nnegligible market share. \n\n \n\nTable 11: Specification for the dependent variable mode of transportation choice \n\nModes of transportation Mode \nBus from the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality (1) \n\nBus from other municipalities - \nIntercity bus - \n\nChartered bus (1) \nSchool vehicle - \nDriving a car (2) \n\nPassenger of a car (2) \nTaxi (cab) (2) \n\nMicrobus from the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality (1) \nMicrobus from other municipality - \n\nIntercity microbus - \nSubway (tube) (1) \n\nTrain (rail) (1) \nMotorcycle (2) \n\nBicycle (3) \nWalking (3) \nOthers - \n\nSource: elaborated by the author \n\n \n\n The following table specifies the independent variables that compose the \n\ndeterministic portion of the utility function. As already mentioned, travel time and \n\ntravel cost are the two most consecrated variables that determine home-work mode \n\nchoice. Since there might be other unobserved variables that can affect mode choice and \n\nmight be correlated with travel time and travel cost, we also included socio-economic \n\ncharacteristics of the individual as control variables: age, sex, whether he studies, the \n\nemployment relationship and the education degree. These variable were chosen both \n\nfrom a theoretic perspective, since they are usually used as control variables in most \n\nempirical works, and from a practical point of view, they are the variables we have \n\navailable in the Metr\u00f4 microdata that are both exogenous and probably correlated with \n\nthe mode choice. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 12: Explanatory variables - code, variable, description and unit of measure \n\nCode Variable Description Unit of measure \n\nTT Travel time \nTotal travel time \n\nbetween origin and \ndestination \n\nHours \n\nTC Travel cost \nTotal travel (variable) \ncost between origin \n\nand destination \nR$ \n\nAge Age Age of the individual Years \nSex Sex Sex of the individual 1-male, 0-female \n\nStudy Study \nWhether the person is \n\ncurrently studying \n1-yes, 0-otherwise \n\nEmploy \nEmployment \nrelationship \n\nDummy variable for \neach  employment \n\nrelationship \n(employee with formal \n\ncontract; employee \nwithout formal \ncontract; public \n\nservant; self \nemployed; employer; \nliberal professional; \n\nfamily business \nowner; and family \n\nworker) \n\n1-if person works as \neth employment \nrelationship; 0-\n\notherwise \n\nDegree Education degree \n\nDummy variable for \neach education degree \n(illiterate/incomplete \nelementary school, \n\ncomplete \nelementary/incomplete \n\nsecondary school, \ncomplete \n\nsecondary/incomplete \nhigh school, complete \n\nhigh/incomplete \ncollege, complete \n\ncollege \n\n1-if person works as \ndth education degree; \n\n0-otherwise \n\nSource: elaborated by the author \n\n \n\n We didn\u2019t include individual income for practical reasons: there were a lot of \n\nmissings in the data. However, we could include the household income in the model, \n\nbut we didn\u2019t do it for theoretical and econometric reasons. It is well accepted that there \n\nis a strong relationship between auto ownership and mode choice; however, one can\u2019t \n\ndirectly include the number of autos in the household as an independent variable \n\nbecause of its strong endogeneity. Before the emerge of the generalized extreme value \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmodels, several proposals have been put forward to try to work around this problem, for \n\nexample Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1974) and Train (1980), including household income \n\nas a regressor would have the same problems as auto ownership, as extensively \n\ndiscussed in the previous papers and in the literature. Also, McFadden (1981) \n\nformulates a model in which income doesn\u2019t influence mode choice since it cancels out \n\nwhen the conditional indirect utility functions of different modes are compared; Small \n\nand Rosen (1981) derive the same results by analyzing user benefits within the discrete \n\nchoice framework. The inclusion of income is empirically advocated by Jara-D\u00edaz and \n\nVidela (1989), although they point out that we can\u2019t recognize it as an exogenous \n\nvariable, but rather representing other phenomenon (taste and habits). \n\n The next chapter presents the work\u2019s results, its interpretation and discussion \n\nwith the literature. First, we show the alternative-specific conditional logit models for \n\nthe 2007 and the 2012 Surveys and the tests on the IIA assumption. We also present two \n\npossible nesting structures for the nested multinomial logit model. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. RESULTS \n\n \n\n 5.1. ALTERNATIVE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONAL LOGIT MODEL \n\n \n\n We first ran two Conditional logit models with case variables (commuter \n\ncharacteristics) for the 2007 and 2012 Surveys. This model is also called Alternative-\n\nspecific conditional logit in the Stata software and it is also known as McFadden\u2019s \n\nchoice model in honor to its contributions to the logit models. In the \u201cpure\u201d Multinomial \n\nlogit, all the coefficients are the individual characteristics (known as case variables) and \n\nrefer to the base alternative (just as when we are interpreting dummy variables). In the \n\nother side of the spectrum, in the \u201cpure\u201d Conditional logit, all the coefficients are the \n\nalternative characteristics (alternative variables) and the coefficients are the same for all \n\nalternatives, it is often called by social scientists as fixed-effect logistic regression \n\nbecause the choices of the same individual are clustered together. The McFadden\u2019s \n\nchoice model is a hybrid because it is composed of both the individual and the \n\nalternative variables, in practice one could ran this model within the Conditional logit \n\nframework by interacting the case variables with J-1 outcome dummy-variables and \n\nsetting the Jth alternative as the base outcome. \n\n Table 15 presents the Alternative-specific conditional logit model for the 2007 \n\nand 2012 Survey. The alternative-specific variables are travel cost and travel time and \n\nthe case variables are sex, age, study, employment relationship and education degree. \n\nThe first column shows the variable names; the next three columns show the estimates \n\nfor the 2007 Survey; and the last three columns show the estimates for the 2012 Survey. \n\nAt the bottom, we have general information about the estimation, the number of \n\nobservations that we used to run the model, the number of cases or individuals, cases \n\ndropped and the value of time, we will detail further the last two. Some cases were \n\ndropped or excluded from the model, because they only had one mode in their choice \n\nset. Since we are estimating a Conditional logit, the choice needs to be conditional on \n\nsome choice set, if the choice set possesses a single option, then it is infeasible to \n\ninclude this individual in the model. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn our specification, the ratio between the travel time and cost coefficients is \n\nknown in the literature as the Value of Travel Time Savings or simply the value of time. \n\nThis is the amount of money people are willing to spend to save a certain amount of \n\ntime (in our case, one hour) of their commute. We found a value of time of R$ 1.78/h \n\nand R$ 1.09/h, for 2007 and 2012 respectively. The monthly wage (nominal values) of \n\nour weighted sample is R$ 1,326.8 and R$ 1,359.18, for 2007 and 2012 respectively; \n\nthis results in an hourly wage-rate15 of R$ 7.65 and R$ 7.84. In his paper about cost-\n\nbenefit analysis, Litman (2008), along with other institutions like the U. S. Department \n\nof Transportation, the Australian Bureau of Transport Economics and the UK \n\nDepartment for Transport, among others, suggests that the value of time should be \n\naround 35% of the hourly-wage. Our estimates lie between 23% and 14%, for 2007 and \n\n2012 respectively, which is a little lower than expected, especially for 2012, this might \n\nbe explained by the fact that the travel time coefficient was much higher than that of \n\n2007, it wasn\u2019t statistically significant and that the 2012 sample was much smaller than \n\nthe 2007. Although the next three studies all used the 2007 Metr\u00f4 survey and almost \n\nidentical methodologies, they found very different commute values of time: Barcellos \n\n(2014) ran two models - a Multinomial logit and a Mixed logit; in the first one she \n\nfound a value of time of R$ 3.27/h, in the second one, R$ -1.02/h; Lucinda et al. (2014) \n\nran a Mixed logit with a value of time of R$ 56.88/h. Pacheco and Chagas found a value \n\nof time of R$ 8.58. \n\nNow we will proceed to the analysis of the individual coefficients, first with \n\nalternative-specific, then the case variables. According to Cameron and Trivedi (2011), \n\na negative sign of an alternative-specific variable means its own-effect is negative and \n\nthe cross-effect is positive, that is, a negative coefficient means that an increase on that \n\nvariable decreases the probability of choosing that alternative and increases the \n\nprobability of choosing the other alternatives. Both travel time and cost variables have a \n\nnegative sign, which is in accordance with our expectations and also is the usual in the \n\nliterature. These variables were all individually significant, except travel time in 2012, \n\nwhich is unusual in the literature, since travel time is expected to play an important role \n\nin the mode choice process. Also, we should note that both time and cost decreased the \n\n                                                           \n15 Hourly wage-rate given by the ratio between the annual wage (monthly wage times twelve) and the \n\naverage number of working hours per year (52 - weeks in year - multiplied by 40 \u2013 the usual  worki g \nday). \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmagnitude of their coefficients (they became less negative), especially time, which more \n\nthan halved its value. \n\nThe case variables have many different pattern behaviors depending on the \n\nSurvey and/or mode of transportation. We will not discuss each variable\u2019s sign and \n\nmagnitude now, only later when we present the average marginal effects. Generally, age \n\nwas significant only for the 2007 Survey for the private mode, sex was significant \n\noverall, study was not significant, the employment relationship dummies were for the \n\nprivate mode in 2007 and not significant in 2012 overall, and the education degree \n\n\u201cHigh school\u201d and \u201cCollege\u201d dummies were significant for private mode in 2007 and \n\nnot significant in 2012. The constants, also called alternative-specific constants, were \n\nestimated for the sole purpose of accounting for any effects not captured by other \n\nvariables, a non-significant coefficient is good sign that the model is well specified. In \n\nour case, these variables were significant for the private mode in 2007 and for the transit \n\nmode in 2012. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 13: Alternative-specific conditional logit for the 2007 and 2012 Surveys \n\n   2007 Survey  2012 Survey \n Generic Transit Private Generic Transit Private \nCost -0.483***   -0.325***   \n (-7.43)   (-4.11)   \nTime -0.861***   -0.354   \n (-5.00)   (-1.13)   \nAge  0.010 0.028***  -0.018* 0.001 \n  (1.79) (5.28)  (-2.39) (0.09) \nSex  -0.350** 0.618***  0.064 0.974*** \n  (-2.79) (5.05)  (0.35) (5.49) \nStudy  -0.268 0.034  -0.456 -0.270 \n  (-1.29) (0.18)  (-1.46) (-0.96) \nInformal contract  -0.341 0.078  0.004 0.180 \n  (-1.89) (0.46)  (0.01) (0.64) \nPublic agent  -0.153 0.154  0.423 0.664 \n  (-0.61) (0.63)  (1.20) (1.93) \nSelf employed  -0.590*** 0.668***  -0.405 0.832*** \n  (-3.29) (3.87)  (-1.61) (3.55) \nEmployer  -1.060** 1.392***  -1.850** 0.675 \n  (-2.91) (4.90)  (-2.66) (1.74) \nIndependent professional 0.124 0.980**  0.912 1.363* \n  (0.34) (2.93)  (1.51) (2.34) \nFamily business employer -0.328 1.646***  -0.091 2.095* \n  (-0.74) (4.52)  (-0.10) (2.43) \nFamily business employee -0.299 2.113***  -3.056* -0.050 \n  (-0.41) (3.57)  (-2.33) (-0.05) \nElementary school  -0.031 0.521  -0.190 -0.076 \n  (-0.09) (1.49)  (-0.37) (-0.15) \nSecondary school  -0.235 0.549  -0.593 -0.158 \n  (-0.68) (1.60)  (-1.17) (-0.32) \nHigh school  0.267 1.106***  -0.196 0.451 \n  (0.82) (3.41)  (-0.40) (0.96) \nCollege  0.191 1.965***  -0.540 1.056* \n  (0.57) (5.94)  (-1.08) (2.16) \n_cons  0.772 -2.189***  2.409*** -0.319 \n  (1.93) (-5.64)  (3.88) (-0.55) \nObservations 30,095   7,545   \nCases 14,202   3,587   \nCases dropped 6,985   2,024   \nValue of time 1.78   1.09   \nt statistics in parentheses \nSource: elaborated by the author \nEmployment relationship base category: Formal contract \nEducation degree base category: Incomplete elementary school \n* p &lt;0.05, ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n There are three variants of the marginal effects: the average marginal effect \n\n(AME), marginal effect at a representative value (MER) and marginal effects at the \n\nmean (MEM). MER provides an estimate of the marginal effect at a particular value, = ?, usually the ? value is the sample mean, thus becoming the marginal effect at \nthe mean (MEM). The AME does a slightly trickier yet elegant computation. We will \n\nexplain it through an example in our context: suppose we are going to estimate the \n\nAME of the sex variable on the probability of choosing a commute mode. The AME \n\ncomputes two scenarios: first, treat each case as if it were female, for example, \n\nregardless of what sex the person really is and leaving all other independent variable \n\nvalues as is, then computing the probability of choosing transit as a mode (then private \n\nand non-motorized as well). Second, we do the same thing, but treating the person as \n\nthough it were male. The difference between the two probabilities is the Average \n\nMarginal Effect. \n\n Table 14 shows the alternative-specific variables\u2019 AME computed for each \n\nSurvey. The first column shows two blocks, one for each variable, cost and time, and \n\neach block is divided by mode of transportation, that is, the first line refers to the AME \n\nof the transit cost. The next three columns refer to the 2007 Survey and the last three, to \n\nthe 2012 Survey. Each Survey has three columns, one for the probability of choosing \n\neach one of the commute modes. For example, the first coefficient (first row second \n\ncolumn), -0.091, shows the AME of the transit cost on the probability of choosing \n\ntransit as a commute mode; the next coefficient on the side (first line third column), \n\n0.034, shows the AME of the transit cost on the probability of choosing private as a \n\ncommute mode, both for the 2007 Survey. As we said in the previous paragraph, the \n\nnegative sign of both cost and time coefficients implied that its own-effect is negative \n\nand the cross-effect is positive. For example, in the first line, a one-unit (R$ 1) increase \n\nin the transit cost is associated with a decrease on the probability of choosing transit by \n\n9.1 percentage points (pp.), an increase on the probability of choosing private by 3.4 pp. \n\nand an increase on the probability of choosing a non-motorized mode by 5.7 pp. All \n\naverage marginal effects were individually statistically significant, except travel time \n\nfor the 2012 Survey. \n\n From this table, we can infer how sensitive commute choice is to cost and time \n\nchanges and how policy interventions would impact the commute mode shares. For \n\nexample, an increase in the transit cost would favor the choice of non-motorized over \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nprivate in 2007 and private over non-motorized in 2012. In 2007, non-motorized cost \n\nand time own-effects are higher than the other modes, that is, it is more sensitive; on the \n\nother hand, in 2012, the three modes are more or less equally sensitive in its own-effect, \n\nwith non-motorized having a slightly lower own-effect. A policy to incentive transit \n\nridership when subsidizing the transit fare by R$ 1 would increase the probability of \n\ntransit ridership by 7.3 pp. and decrease the private commute by 4 pp and non-\n\nmotorized by 3.2 pp. in 2012. A policy to inhibit private commute when taxing gasoline \n\nby R$ 1 would decrease the probability of choosing private by 9.7 pp. and increase the \n\nprobability of transit ridership by 3.4 pp. and non-motorized by 6.3 pp. in 2007. A \n\npolicy to decrease transit travel times, for example, the creation of exclusive bus lanes, \n\nby 6 min (or 0.1 hours in our measure) would increase the probability of transit \n\nridership by 0.79 pp. and decrease the private probability by 0.44 pp. and non-motorized \n\nby 0.35 pp. Another possible policy could be to incentive bicycle ridership to work. \n\nLike what France and United Stated do, Brazil could incentive bicycle and walk \n\ncommuting by subsidizing it by the amount of the transit fare, R$ 3.2 in 2012, which \n\nwould, on average, increase the probability of non-motorizing commuting by 21.44 pp. \n\nand decrease transit by 10.24 and private by 10.88 pp. \n\n \n\nTable 14: Alternative-specific variables\u2019 average marginal effects \n\n        2007 Survey             2012 Survey \n\nCost Transit Private \nNon-\n\nmotorized \nTransit Private \n\nNon-\nmotorized \n\nTransit -0.091*** 0.034*** 0.057*** -0.073*** 0.040*** 0.032** \n (-10.15) (11.61) (6.43) (-4.70) (7.23) (2.86) \n\nPrivate 0.034*** -0.097*** 0.063*** 0.040*** -0.075*** 0.034** \n (11.61) (-11.14) (7.19) (7.23) (-4.70) (2.88) \n\nNon-motorized 0.057*** 0.063 -0.120*** 0.032** 0.034** -0.067** \n (6.43) (7.19) (-6.85) (2.86) (2.88) (-2.88) \n\nTime       \nTransit -0.163*** 0.061*** 0.101*** -0.079 0.044 0.035 \n\n (-6.48) (11.72) (4.62) (-1.18) (1.36) (1.01) \nPrivate 0.061*** -0.174*** 0.112*** 0.044 -0.081 0.037 \n\n (11.72) (-6.48) (4.78) (1.36) (-1.17) (1.00) \nNon-motorized 0.101*** 0.112*** -0.214*** 0.035 0.037 -0.073 \n\n (4.62) (4.78) (-4.72) (1.01) (1.00) (-1.00) \n\nz statistics in parentheses \n\nSource: elaborated by the author \n* p &lt;0.05, ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001 \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 15 presents the case variables\u2019 average marginal effects for the 2007 \n\nSurvey. The first column shows the variable names and the next three columns show the \n\nAME for each mode of transport. We will comment first the continuous variables, in \n\nour case only age, then the categorical variables. Age shows a significant coefficient \n\nonly for private and non-motorized modes; transit and non-motorized presented a \n\nnegative sign, this indicates a negative relationship between age and the choice of these \n\nmodes. The interpretation of its magnitude is as follows: using transit as example, the \n\naverage marginal effect of a one unit (one year) increase in age is associated with a 0.1 \n\npercentage point decrease of choosing transit as a commute mode, adjusted to the \n\nsample distributions of all the variables in the model. \n\nGoing now to the categorical variables, sex shows a significant coefficient for \n\ntransit and non-motorized modes. The sign interpretation is slightly different from the \n\ncontinuous variables. A negative sign means a given category has a lower probability of \n\nchosen a certain mode of transport compared to the base category. Males have a lower \n\nprobability of choosing transit and non-motorized than females, and the inverse is true \n\nfor the private modes. The magnitude interpretation is as follows: being a male raises \n\nthe probability of choosing private as commute mode by 15 percentage points compared \n\nto females. Study was not a significant variable in neither mode of transport, it showed a \n\nnegative sign for transit and positive for the other modes. For the employment \n\nrelationship, public agent was not significant; informal contract was significant only for \n\nthe transit mode; independent professional and family business employee was \n\nsignificant for private only; self employed, employer and family business employer was \n\nsignificant for transit and private modes. All categories were negative for the transit \n\nmode compared to the base category, formal contract, positive for the private mode, and \n\nnegative for non-motorized, except for the informal contract. The higher magnitudes \n\nwere found for the employer and family business employee categories. For the \n\neducation degree, elementary and secondary school were significant only for the private \n\nmode, high school was significant for private and non-motorized, and college was \n\nsignificant for all modes of transport. A negative sign was found for all the categories \n\nfor the transit and non-motorized modes, and positive for the private mode. We can see \n\nan increase both in magnitude and significance, the higher the education degree. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 15: Case variables\u2019 average marginal effects for the 2007 Survey \n\n   2007 Survey  \n Transit Private Non-motorized \nAge -0.001 0.005*** -0.005*** \n (0.22) (6.20) (3.75) \nSex -0.111*** 0.150*** -0.039 \n (5.63) (7.24) (1.32) \nStudy -0.053 0.026 0.027 \n (1.88) (0.96) (0.58) \nInformal contract -0.070** 0.040 0.030 \n (2.73) (1.55) (0.72) \nPublic agent -0.040 0.041 -0.002 \n (1.19) (1.19) (0.03) \nSelf employed -0.159*** 0.177*** -0.017 \n (5.74) (6.16) (0.42) \nEmployer -0.301*** 0.357*** -0.057 \n (4.75) (6.84) (0.77) \nIndependent professional -0.047 0.189*** -0.143 \n (0.92) (3.93) (1.71) \nFamily business employer -0.180** 0.356*** -0.176 \n (2.60) (6.13) (1.89) \nFamily business employee -0.208 0.449*** -0.241 \n (1.82) (4.74) (1.60) \nElementary school -0.043 0.108* -0.064 \n (0.85) (1.96) (0.79) \nSecondary school -0.083 0.127* -0.044 \n (1.68) (2.38) (0.55) \nHigh school -0.028 0.205*** -0.176* \n (0.60) (4.01) (2.31) \nCollege -0.105*** 0.384*** -0.279*** \n (2.03) (6.90) (3.59) \nz statistics in parentheses \nsource: elaborated by the author \n* p &lt;0.05, ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001 \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n Table 16 presents the case variables\u2019 average marginal effects for the 2012 \n\nSurvey, it has the same layout as the previous table. Starting the coefficients \n\ninterpretation, age shows a significant coefficient for transit and private modes, with a \n\npositive sign for private and non-motorized modes. Compared to the previous table, the \n\nsign for transit and private remained equal, that means, the older the person, the greater \n\nthe probability of choosing private and the lower the probability of choosing transit. For \n\nthe non-motorized, the sign changed from negative to positive; however, it was not \n\nstatistically significant in 2012, we would expect its sign to be negative and to have a \n\ngreater magnitude than transit, as it happens in 2007. Sex was significant for all modes \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwith a positive sign for the private mode only, exactly the same as the previous table: \n\nmales have a higher probability of choosing private compared to females, and females \n\nhave a higher probability of choosing transit and non-motorized compared to males. \n\nStudy was not significant at all, the same as the previous Survey. For the employment \n\nrelationship, informal contract was not statistically significant; public agent and \n\nindependent professional were significant only for the private mode; self employed, \n\nemployer, family business employer and family business employee were significant for \n\ntransit and private modes. All significant variables were negative for the transit mode, \n\npositive for the private mode and not statistically significant for non-motorized mode, \n\nthis is the same general behavior in terms of significance and sign compared to the \n\nprevious Survey, although the magnitudes changed slightly according to the variable. \n\nFor the education degree, college was the only significant variable and only for transit \n\nand private modes. All the variables were negative for the transit mode, positive for the \n\nprivate mode, for the non-motorized mode, elementary and secondary school were \n\npositive and high school and college were negative, compared to the base category \n\nilliterate or incomplete elementary school. For the transit and private modes, we can that \n\nthe higher the education degree, the greater the coefficient magnitude: more formal \n\neducation is associated with a lower probability of choosing transit as a commute mode \n\nand a higher probability of choosing a private mode. In the non-motorized mode, the \n\neffect is somewhat small and neither coefficient is statistically significant.

In the first column we can see the survey year \n\nand the mode of transportation. In the next four columns we can see the Hausman \n\nstatistics and in the next four columns the Hausman-McFadden statistics. The tests were \n\nconducted according to the following procedure: one mode of transport is defined as the \n\nbase alternative, the test statistic is calculated excluding one of the other alternatives, \n\nsince we have three modes of transportation, there are two possibilities for exclusion, \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthat is why we have two calculated statistic for each test for each mode of \n\ntransportation. For example, in the first line, transit was kept as the base outcome, then \n\nin the 574.41 chi2, we excluded the private mode, and in the 1076.25 chi2 we excluded \n\nthe non-motorized mode. Most of the times, we rejected the null hypothesis of the IIA \n\nassumption, except in the Hausman test keeping the non-motorized mode as base \n\noutcome, when in three cases it didn\u2019t meet the asymptotic assumptions (it returned  a \n\nnegative statistic) and in one case it didn\u2019t reject the null hypothesis. Also, in the \n\nHausman-McFadden test for the private mode in 2012, the variance matrix was non-\n\nsymmetric or highly singular; the software returned the coefficients, but not the robust \n\nstandard errors. Although McFadden (1974a, p. 243) argues that the Multinomial and \n\nConditional logit models should be used in cases where the alternatives \u201ccan plausibly \n\nbe assumed to be distinct and weighted independently in the eyes of each decision \n\nmaker\u201d. This is probably our case, since we have well distinguished alternatives; \n\nhowever, we aggregated the alternatives according to our needs and possibilities, but, \n\npossibly, in the eyes of the decision makers they were dependent of each other. Since \n\nwe rejected the IIA assumption in our tests, we will proceed to further specify a Nested \n\nlogit model, which doesn\u2019t rely on this assumption.  \n\n \n\nTable 17: Tests for the IIA assumption (2007 and 2012 Surveys) \n\n Hausman Hausman-McFadden \n\n2007 chi2 p chi2 p chi2 p chi2 p \n\nTransit 574.41 0.00 1076.25 0.00 365.82 0.00 1025.18 0.00 \n\nPrivate 443.09 0.00 286.06 0.00 347.28 0.00 231.01 0.00 \n\nNon-motorized -502.88 .* -206.45 .* 1107.23 0.00 523.51 0.00 \n\n2012         \n\nTransit 289.16 0.00 670.04 0.00 156.66 0.00 275.43 0.00 \n\nPrivate 185.83 0.00 0.00 1.00 65981.84 0.00 ** ** \n\nNon-motorized -73.15 .* 5.52 0.99 220.31 0.00 197.97 0.00 \n\nH0: the IIA assumption holds. \n\n* If chi2<0, the estimated model does not meet asymptotic assumptions. \n\n** The variance matrix is nonsymmetric or highly singular.

The Nested logit groups similar alternatives into nests, inside a nest we \n\ncan relax the IIA assumption while between nests, the IIA is still valid. \n\n \n\n 5.2. NESTED LOGIT MODELS \n\n \n\n Although we have a clear gain by relaxing the IIA assumption, the Nested logit \n\nalso has its disadvantages. The main one is the nesting design. Since we need to group \n\nsimilar alternatives, we have to define ex ante which alternatives are similar in a \n\ncompletely arbitrary process. We have only three alternatives, so this is not so much of \n\na problem, since there are only three possible ways which we can group our alternatives. \n\nAll the possibilities are illustrated in the following figure. Two alternatives will always \n\nbe grouped together and one alternative will be left alone, with no further branching: \n\nthis case is known as a degenerate branch, a branch with only one alternative. The tree \n\ndesign number 1 is separates between motorized (transit and private) and non-\n\nmotorized; tree number 2 separates between what we called \u201cfringe\u201d modes (transit and \n\nnon-motorized) and private motorized; tree number 3 separates between individual \n\n(private and non-motorized) and transit. \n\n \n\nSource: elaborated by the author \n\nFigure 7: Tree design possibilities. Design 1: grouping transit and private in the same \nbranch. Design 2: grouping transit and non-motorized in the same branch. Design 3: \ngrouping private and non-motorized in the same branch. \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The next three tables show the Nested logit models results, they all have a \n\nsimilar layout. The names of the variables appear in the first column, in the second \n\ncolumn we have the coefficients of the 2007 Survey and in the third column we have \n\nthe coefficients of the 2012 Survey. The first block (first two lines) we have the \n\nalternative-specific variables time and cost; in the next block we have the first-level \n\ncoefficients or the case variables; as second-level coefficients, we only used the \n\nalternative-specific constants; then we have the first-level taus or dissimilarity \n\nparameters, which measure the degree of correlation of random shocks within each of \n\nthe types of transportation, dissimilarity parameters greater than one imply that the \n\nmodel is inconsistent with the Random Utility Model (RUM); the Conditional logit is a \n\nspecial case of the Nested logit in which all the dissimilarity parameters are equal to \n\none, at the bottom of the output, we find a likelihood-ratio test of this hypothesis. \n\nEquivalently, the property known as the IIA imposed by the Conditional logit model \n\nholds if and only if all dissimilarity parameters are equal to one. \n\n Table 18 presents the Nested logit results for the tree design number 1. We will \n\nkeep the following discussion brief because we already did it extensively in the \n\nConditional logit. The alternative-specific variables were all significant, except time in \n\nthe 2012 Survey. The implicit Value of Time is R$ 1.13 and R$ 0.26 for 2007 and 2012, \n\nrespectively, which is a lot lower than expected for 2012. For 2007, age, study, the \n\nemployment relationship and the highest education degree were significant; for 2012, \n\nsex and three categories of the employment relationship were significant only. The \n\nalternative-specific constants were significant only for 2007, indicating that there are \n\nsome unaccounted factors that influence the commute mode choice. The taus are less \n\nthan or equal to one, that is, they are in the expected interval, one of them is always \n\nexactly equal to one, because it is the degenerate branch. The Likelihood Ratio test \n\nindicates that we cannot reject the null that all of the log-sum coefficients are 1 and \n\nhence we should go back to the Conditional logit model. \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 18: Nested logit, tree design number 1 (2007 and 2012 Surveys) \n\n 2007 Survey 2012 Survey \n   \nTime -0.283* -0.0614 \n (-2.40) (-0.29) \nCost -0.251*** -0.233** \n (-6.00) (-2.78) \nMotorized   \nAge 0.0235*** -0.00587 \n (7.34) (-0.96) \nSex 0.0192 0.519*** \n (0.25) (3.38) \nStudy 0.269* -0.320 \n (2.05) (-1.22) \nEmployment relationship:   \nInformal contract -0.114 0.0233 \n (-0.98) (0.09) \nPublic agent -0.102 0.380 \n (-0.66) (1.25) \nSelf employed 0.292** 0.573** \n (2.85) (2.68) \nEmployer 0.671*** 0.0275 \n (3.48) (0.08) \nIndependent professional 0.554* 1.064* \n (2.52) (2.12) \nFamily business employer 1.634*** 1.320* \n (5.52) (2.41) \nFamily business employee 1.105** -0.485 \n (2.68) (-0.52) \nEducation degree:   \nPrimary school 0.262 0.159 \n (1.20) (0.31) \nSecondary school 0.377 -0.0621 \n (1.79) (-0.12) \nHigh school 0.903*** 0.489 \n (4.53) (1.01) \nCollege 1.503*** 0.747 \n (7.38) (1.52) \nTransit_cons -0.182*** 0.0848 \n (-6.77) (0.96) \nNon-motorized_cons 0.986*** -0.486 \n (4.11) (-0.88) \nMotorized tau 0.729*** 0.711** \n (5.84) (2.67) \nNon-motorized tau 1.000 1.000 \n (0.00) (0.00) \nLR test for IIA (tau=1), p-value 0.113 0.575 \nt statistics in parentheses \nsource: elaborated by the author \n* p &lt;0.05, ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001 \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Table 19 presents the Nested logit results for the tree design number 2.

DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS \n\n \n\n This research attempted to measure the correlation between economic, \n\ndemographic and transportation variables and the probability of choosing a certain \n\ncommute mode of transport. We began by giving a brief history of the work commute, \n\nthe importance and the relationship of the automobile in the process, and illustrating the \n\ncommute pattern with the Brazilian and S\u00e3o Paulo average travel times, usage and \n\nownership cost of private and transit modes, and an overview of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nWe proceeded to the contribution of the present work, as well as the statement of the \n\nhypothesis and the objectives. \n\n We dived into a more technical explanation of the transportation literature. First, \n\nby presenting a simple abstraction of the transportation market, with its supply and \n\ndemand, showing how congestion deviate the equilibrium from the social optimum to a \n\nlower and less efficient private equilibrium, when roads are untolled. We also presented \n\na mathematical formulation of the Down-Thomson paradox, in which every individual \n\ntraveler suffers from a higher generalized travel cost after the highway capacity \n\nexpansion due to the direct and indirect effects of the volume shifting. We derived the \n\nmost important discrete choice statistical models aligned with microeconomic theory \n\nbased on the Random Utility Maximization, first the Logit, the Multinomial logit (ML) \n\nand the Conditional logit (CL), all of which rely on the Independence of Irrelevant \n\nAlternative (IIA) assumption, that is, the probability ratio of two alternatives is totally \n\nindependent of any other alternative in the choice set. Despite the fact that it is heavily a \n\nconceptual matter whether the IIA holds or not in a given choice set, we presented three \n\nstatistical tests to validate or not the IIA assumption. Then, we exposed a recent class of \n\nmodels that do not rely on the IIA assumption, called Generalized Extreme Value \n\n(GEV) mode, whose most prominent member are the Nested logit (NL) and Cross-\n\nNested Logit (CNL) models. Finally, we discussed some of the most relevant works in \n\nthe rich mode choice literature, beginning with works of Daniel McFadden in the \n\ndecade of 1970\u2019s up until the GEV models in the 2000\u2019s. \n\n In the third chapter, we explained our data sources as well as our empirical \n\nstrategy. The core dataset is composed of two of the most recent transportation surveys \n\ncarried out by the Metr\u00f4 company, but we also collected gasoline prices from the ANP \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nand yearly vehicle mileage from the INMETRO. We begin our strategy by showing \n\nexactly how we pre-processed our data: dropping missing values, smoothing noisy data, \n\nremoving outliers and resolving inconsistencies. The second part consisted of estimating \n\nthe counterfactual travel times, that is, the travel times of the modes not taken (not \n\nobserved in the dataset). Thirdly, we estimated the observed and counterfactual travel \n\ncosts. Finally, we made explicit our model specification for both the dependent and the \n\nindependent variables. \n\n In the fourth chapter, we showed our results from the models estimation for both \n\n2007 and 2012 Surveys. First, we specified a Conditional logit model, which has both \n\nalternative-specific and case-specific variables. Cost and travel time, the alternative-\n\nspecific variables, were negatively correlated with the probability of choosing any \n\ncommute mode, which was as expected and fully confirmed our initial hypothesis about \n\nthese coefficients. The Value of Travel Time Savings (VoTT), that is the ratio between \n\nthe time and cost coefficients, we found was low compared to some studies and high \n\ncompared to others, in a somewhat middle ground; this is a strong indicator that more \n\nstudies are necessary to confirm the true magnitude of the S\u00e3o Paulo Value of Time. We \n\nalso estimated the average marginal effects (AVE) for the cost and time variables, with \n\nthis information we can precisely know how this variables are correlated with the \n\nprobability of choosing a certain commute mode. For example, were we interested in \n\ndiscouraging private commuting by raising a gasoline tax by R$ 1/L, we would expect \n\nthat in 2012 the probability of choosing private mode decrease by 7.5 p.p. and increase \n\nin 4 p.p. and 3.4 p.p. for transit and non-motorized, respectively. The AVE for the case \n\nvariables revealed that males have a higher probability of choosing private modes and a \n\nlower probability of choosing transit and non-motorized modes, confirming our initial \n\nhypothesis. Older people have a lower probability of choosing transit and non-\n\nmotorized and a higher probability of choosing private as commute mode, except the \n\nnon-motorized coefficient for 2012, which was not significant, thus partially confirming \n\nour hypothesis. A formal contract as employment relationship leads to a higher \n\nprobability of choosing transit, in accordance with our initial hypothesis, but is \n\ncorrelated with a lower probability of choosing private as commute mode, contrary to \n\nour hypothesis. A higher education degree is associated with a lower probability of \n\nchoosing transit (contrary to expected), a higher probability of choosing private modes \n\nand a lower probability of choosing non-motorized modes, as initially expected. We \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nperformed the Hausman and the Hausman-McFadden tests for the Independence of the \n\nIrrelevant Alternative assumption, most of the results pointed to a rejection of the IIA \n\nassumption. Our next step was to specify a Nested logit model, since we have three \n\nalternatives, there were also three nesting possibilities, which we estimated for each \n\nSurvey. The significance, sign and magnitude of the coefficients were somewhat similar \n\nbetween the Nested logit models and the Alternative-specific logit models; however, the \n\nValue of Time ranged to some degree of variability and, perhaps more importantly, \n\nthere were some cases were we rejected IIA assumption and others which we did not, \n\nbased on the results of the Likelihood Ratio test. This indicates the dependence of the \n\nIIA assumption on the model specification and the nesting structure, pointing to the \n\nneed for further investigation in these topics. \n\nIn view of the previous results, we fully accept our initial hypothesis that travel \n\ncost and time is negatively associated with the probability of choosing a certain \n\ncommute mode, and also that its own-effect is negative and the cross-effect is positive, \n\nfor both variables. We also showed that the demographic characteristics \u2013 age, sex, \n\nstudy, employment relationship and education degree - were also significantly \n\nassociated with the probability of choosing a certain commute mode. \n\nThe present work can serve as basis for further research in the transport mode \n\nchoice, especially in the Brazilian context. However, we are fully aware that the present \n\nwork can be improved in many aspects. For example, instead of estimating travel time \n\ncounterfactuals using econometric techniques, there are more appropriate \n\nmethodologies specifically for this purpose, micro-simulation is one such case, as \n\nimplemented by softwares like TransCAD, Vissim, MATSim, Quadstone Paramics, \n\nTRANUS and others. Also, past data could be gathered for S\u00e3o Paulo to see changes in \n\ntime, because the Metr\u00f4\u2019s survey was first made in 1960; however, public data is only \n\navailable for 2007 and 2012 at the moment. We could expand the mode choice analysis \n\nfor other Brazilian cities that had at least one origin-destination survey, for example, \n\none such city that available publicly and freely its data is Belo Horizonte (for 2002 and \n\n2012). \n\n   \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nALVARENGA, G.

Since 1993, it includes three \nquestions about the morning commute travel times. \n\n The first question people are asked is whether they work; if they do, they are \nasked whether their workplace is the same as their residence (if yes, we account their \ncommute times as 0min); if not, they are asked how much time does it take them to go \nstraight from home to work, according to four categories: less than 30min, between 30 \nand 60min, between 60 and 120min or more than 120min. We could treat each interval \nas point data at their mean (e.g. the first category is always equal to a 15min commute, \nthe second is 45min and the third is 90min) and treating the last category as being \nalways equal to a point data of 120min \u2013 as in Pereira and Schwanen (2013); however, \nthis does not take into account the true nature of the data: it is interval data and the last \ncategory (more than 120min) is right-censored. Therefore, we estimated the average \nmorning commute times by regressing each year\u2019s microdata on a constant only, which \nprovides a more accurate proxy for the average metropolitan commute times. The \nprocess involves maximizing the following log-likelihood function: = ? log { ? ? ? ? ?? }? + ? log {? ? ?? ? ? ? ?? }     (29) \nIn which the first sum comprises the observations ?R are right-censored; we know only \nthat the unobserved  is greater than or equal to ? . The second sum comprises the \nobservations which are intervals ?I, we know only that the unobserved  is in the \ninterval [ , ]."}]}}}
