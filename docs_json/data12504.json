Bacteria are the main \ninfectious agents in goats with respiratory disease. \nM. haemolytica is an opportunistic bacterium that \ncauses pleuropneumonia in ruminants, mainly \ncattle, and although, goats are less susceptible they \n\nare also vulnerable in stressful conditions such as \ntransportation (RAHAL et al., 2014; PONNUSAMY \net al., 2017; SINGH et al., 2011).\n\nM. haemolytica pleuropneumonia can \naffect goats of all ages (RAHAL et al., 2014; \nEKONG et al., 2015). The disease can cause high \neconomic losses due to treatment costs, slowdown \nin weight gain, condemnation of carcasses, and a \ndecrease of meat and milk production (EMIKPE et \nal., 2010; PONNUSAMY et al., 2017). Diagnosis is \nbased on clinical history, clinical signs, gross and \nhistopathological findings, associated with bacteria \n\n1Setor de Patologia Veterin\u00e1ria, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), 91540.000, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.

Forty goats transported from the Northeast to the Southern region of Brazil died \nduring shipment, or 2-3 days after unloading. Clinical signs included dyspnea, mucopurulent nasal discharge, and coughing. All goats were \nnecropsied, and multiple tissues were collected for histopathological analysis and involved agent identifications. All lungs showed pulmonary \nconsolidation, predominantly affecting the cranioventral lobes, in addition to the marked fibrinous pleuritis, pleural thickening, and pleural \nadhesions, that affected 90% of the goats. Histologically, there was fibrino-suppurative pleuropneumonia characterized by a diffuse neutrophilic \ninfiltrate admixed with fibrin. Non-hemolytic [85% (34/40)] and hemolytic [15% (6/40)] species were obtained in bacteriological culture. Fir \nMannheimia spp. was reported in 26 isolates and subsequently confirmed as M. haemolytica (99% identity), after amplification and partial \nsequencing of the 16S rDNA gene. Stress may trigger the development of bacterial pleuropneumonia in goats, and non-hemolytic strains of M. \nhaemolytica may cause this condition in goats with severe immunosuppression.\nKey words: goat diseases, respiratory diseases, pathology, PCR.\n\nRESUMO: Descreve-se os aspectos epidemiol\u00f3gicos, cl\u00ednicos, patol\u00f3gicos e bacteriol\u00f3gicos da pleuropneumonia por Mannheimia haemolytica \nem caprinos, ap\u00f3s transporte prolongado. Quarenta caprinos transportados da regi\u00e3o Nordeste para a regi\u00e3o Sul do Brasil morreram durante \na viagem ou 2-3 dias ap\u00f3s o desembarque.

However, \nprevention strategies are more effective and include \nthe improvement of housing conditions, sanitary \nmanagement, and biosecurity practices. Avoiding \nstressful factors, such as the assembly of animals \nfrom different origins without proper quarantine is \nalso effective (SILVA et al., 2012; ZECCHINON et \nal., 2005). Additionally, administration of minerals, \nvitamins, food, and water of high quality, can aid in \nprevention (EMIKPE et al., 2010). Many farmers do \nnot understand the effects of poor transport conditions, \nwhich often lead to a reduction in immunity and \ncolonization of the lung by opportunistic agents. \nThis report described the epidemiological, clinical, \npathological, and bacteriological findings of 40 M. \nhaemolytica pleuropneumonia cases associated with \nstress due to shipment.\n\nMATERIALS   AND   METHODS\n\nEpidemiology, clinical signs, pathology, and \nbacteriology\n\nOver a 1.5-year time span (June 2016 to \nDecember 2017), eight trucks transported hundreds \nof goats along similar routes from the Northeast \nBrazil to Porto Alegre. These goats were housed in \ntwo farms located in the municipality of Porto Alegre \n(Parallel 30\u00ba between 29\u00ba10\u201930\u2019\u2019 South and Meridian \n50\u00ba between 51\u00ba05\u201900\u2019\u2019 West), where 40 goats died \nand were sent for necropsy. At necropsy, fragments \nof various organs were collected and fixed in 10% \nneutral buffered formalin. Samples were routinely \nprocessed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin \n(HE) for histopathological analysis. Samples of \nlungs were also collected for bacteriological culture. \nData on the outbreak was obtained through field-\nwork on the farms.\n\nSamples were processed and cultivated \nunder aerobic and microaerobic conditions in \n5% sheep blood agar and MacConkey agar, and \nincubated for 72h at 37\u00b0C. The isolated bacterial \ncolonies were identified by their cultural, \nmorphologic and biochemical characteristics \naccording to MARKEY et al. (2013).\n\nMolecular identification\nTwenty-six bacterial isolates were submitted to \n\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to identification. \n\nBacterial cells were harvested from blood agar and total \nbacterial DNA was extracted using QIAmp DNA Kit \n(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \nThe PCR assay was projected for the amplification of \na 499bp fragment of Mannheimia spp. 16S rRNA gene \n(forward primer: 5\u2019-TCACCAAGCCGTCGATCTCT-3\u2019, \nreverse primer: 5\u2019-TTCGCACATGAGCGTCAGTAC-3). \nPCRmix included 1U Taq Platinum (Invitrogen), 10X \nof buffer Taq, 15pmol of each primer, 200nM of each \ndeoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 1.5mM MgCl2 and \n20ng of the total DNA in a final volume of 25?L. The PCR \nconditions were: 95\u00b0C for 5min followed by 35 cycles of \n95\u00b0C for 30 seconds (s), 59\u00b0C for 45s and 72\u00b0C for 30s, \nand a final cycle of 72\u00b0C for 10min. The Mannheimia \nspecie determination was performed amplifying the whole \n16S rRNA ribosomal sequence (1,450bp) following by \nsequencing and analysis according previously described \nby SIQUEIRA et al. (2018). The generated sequence was \ndeposited in the GenBank (accession number MK106144). \nMultiple alignment were performed with Mannheimia \nrelated species 16S rDNA sequences, available from \nGenBank (NCBI) database, in ClustalW alignment, and \na phylogenetic tree was constructed using the genetic \ndistance model of Tamura-Nei by UPGMA method with \n1,000 replicates, including Escherichia coli as outgroup, in \nthe Genious Tree Builder (Geneious version 9.1).\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn eight shipments of goats conducted \nfrom June 2016 to December 2017 from Northeast \nBrazil to Porto Alegre in closed trucks with poor \nventilation and hygiene, 40 6\u2013month-old to 4-year-\nold goats (28 males and 12 females) died due to \npleuropneumonia. All goats were densely crowded \ntogether, irrespective of their origin, age, sex or \nhealth condition. The mortality levels varied in \neach transport, and included other causes, such as \nhaemonchosis, cetosis, E. coli, Salmonella spp. and \nEimeria spp. enteritis. Each truck carried 300-700 \ngoats and traveled a distance of 3,769km over for \napproximately 5 days. According to the owners, \ngoats were not allowed to leave the truck during the \nshipment, and water was not available. On arrival, \nsome goats were dead, and others showed symptoms \nincluding poor body condition, apathy, anorexia, \ndyspnea, bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge \n(Figure 1A), and died within 3-5 days.\n\nAt  necropsy, goats had a regular to poor \nbody condition, were dehydrated, and showed \nmucopurulent nasal discharge. Consistent findings \nincluded non-collapsing lungs with varying degrees \nof right cranioventral consolidation (Table 1). These \n\n\n\nMannheimia haemolytica pleuropneumonia in goats associated with shipping stress.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.49, n.1, 2019.\n\n3\n\nconsolidation areas were dark-red and firm, and \nfrequently covered by fibrin (Figure 1B and 1C), in \naddition to a pinkish foam in the trachea and large \nbronchi. In 90% (36/40) of the cases, adhesions of the \nvisceral to parietal pleura were observed. Gelatinous \npleural effusion occurred in 37.5% (15/40) of the \nnecropsied goats. Twenty percent (8/40) of the goats \nhad large numbers of nematodes (Haemonchus \ncontortus) in the abomasal lumen.\n\nHistologically, all goats had a \nfibrinosuppurative pleuropneumonia, characterized \nby a marked focally extensive inflammatory infiltrate \nin the pleura, alveoli, bronchi, and bronchioles. \n\nExudate consisted mainly of intact and degenerate \nneutrophils occasionally with deformed elongated \nnuclei (\u201coat cells\u201d) associated with marked necrosis \nof the respiratory epithelium and fibrin deposition \n(Figure 1D). Additionally few lymphocytes, plasma \ncells, or macrophages were observed within the \ncellular infiltrate. The visceral pleura was markedly \nthickened by a layer of fibrin associated with \nneutrophils (Figure 1E). Marked intra-alveolar and \ninterlobular edema of the pulmonary septa was \nobserved in all cases.\n\nIn all samples cultured in blood agar, pure \ncultures of the genus Mannheimia were isolated, of \n\nFigure 1 - Pleuropneumonia by Mannheimia haemolytica in goats in Brazil.

The isolates \nwere positive for esculin-hydrolysis, negative for \nONPG beta-galactosidase and unable to grow on \nMacConkey\u2019s agar.\n\nThe PCR assay was positive for \nMannheimia spp. in all isolates, as identified \nby the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Subsequently, \nM. haemolytica was confirmed by complete \nsequencing of the 16S rDNA gene with 99% \nidentity in all analyzed isolates. Furthermore, the \nphylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) confirmed the \nbacteria as M. haemolytica, by the clusterization \nof the N706/16 others M. haemolytica strains with \nhigh confidence. \n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe diagnosis of pleuropneumonia \nin the goats of the current report was based on \nepidemiological, pathological, bacteriological, \nand molecular findings. The shipment of goats is \na common farm practice (SINGH et al., 2011). \nHowever, transportation of live animals between \ndistant regions without animal welfare consideration \nmay result in high mortality. Deaths are most often \ncaused by respiratory disease, a condition known \nas \u201cshipping fever\u201d (VIANA et al., 2007; ROSA \net al., 2013). Aggravating adverse conditions in \ntransportation were evident in our study. The \ngoats were transported between two distant and \nmarkedly different regions (the Northeast and the \nSouthern Brazilian regions are climatically distinct, \nespecially, regarding temperature and humidity). \nTransportation vehicles had a closed environment \nwith poor air quality and densely crowded animals. \nPneumonia caused by stress due to transportation has \nbeen described in shipping fever in cattle (ROSA et \nal., 2013), sheep, and goats (AHMED et al., 2017; \nEKONG et al., 2015; RICE et al., 2008). \n\nGross and microscopic lesions observed \nin all goats examined in the present study are similar \nto those described for shipping fever (WILD &amp; \nMILLER, 1991; MAHU et al., 2015; ZECCHINON \net al., 2005). Aggravating stress factors related to \ntransportation most likely affected the development \nand severity of the disease observed in the goats \nof this report; stress factors such as commingling \nanimals from different origins, transmission of the \nagent among animals, and the maintenance of the \ninfection due to the high humidity, resulted in high \nmorbidity during transport (PONNUSAMY et al., \n2017; SINGH et al., 2011). It is likely that the clinical \nsigns were aggravated by the lack of food, and \nwater, the long duration of the shipment, parasitism \nby bloodsucking nematodes and poor management \npractices (EKONG et al., 2015; ZECCHINON et al., \n2005). It is suggested that all these adverse conditions \ncause changes in the respiratory microenvironment \nresulting in upper airway irritation and reduction of \nmucociliary clearance, reduction in innate immunity, \nand consequently, adhesion and colonization of the \nlungs by pathogenic bacteria (RAHAL et al., 2014; \nVIANA et al., 2007). \n\nM. haemolytica is characterized by \nhemolysis in blood agar, growth on MacConkey\u2019s \nagar and biochemical positivity and negativity for \nbeta-galactosidase and esculin hydrolysis tests, \nrespectively (MARKEY et al., 2013). However, \natypical phenotypic characteristics were reported \nin 85% of the isolates of our cases; although, M. \nhaemolytica was identified in all samples through \nthe molecular analysis. Using phylogenetic \nanalysis we were able to infer that the isolates \nare M. haemolytica, since other closely related \nMannheimia species did not align to our isolates in \nthe phylogenetical analysis. \n\nM. haemolytica with deletion of the \nhemolysin gene was previously reported in association \nwith pleuropneumonia and septicemia in a bovine \ncalf (MAHU et al., 2015) and in nasopharyngeal \nbiopsy of healthy sheep (WILD &amp; MILLER, 1991). \nNon-typical characteristics of the isolates obtained in \nthe present study included no growth in MacConkey \nagar, as well as beta-hemolytic negative colonies and \npositive beta-galactosidase ONPG, which is atypical \nfor M. haemolytica. It is likely that the immuno \ncompromised goats became more vulnerable to \nchanges from commensal non-hemolytic bacteria to \nopportunistic pathogens (YENER et al., 2009). \n\nSeveral factors may interfere in the \nphenotypic variation of microorganisms, such \nas environmental factors (RAHAL et al., 2014), \nenzymatic inhibition by drugs, serotype particularities \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Distribution of lesions in the pulmonary \nlobes. \n\n \n\nDistribution  Cases (%) \n\nCranioventral 67.5 \nCranial 22.5 \nMultifocal 2.5 \nMiddle 2.5 \nCranial and middle 5.0 \n\n \n\n\n\nMannheimia haemolytica pleuropneumonia in goats associated with shipping stress.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.49, n.1, 2019.\n\n5\n\n(RICE et al., 2008) and handling of samples (YENER \net al., 2009). Other authors have also obtained non-\nhemolytic M. haemolytica isolates and confirmed \nthem using molecular methods (YENER et al., 2009; \nMAHU et al., 2015). High sensitivity and specificity \nof the test were observed in hemolytic as well as \nnon-hemolytic isolates, which makes the molecular \ntest indispensable and recommended for definitive \ndiagnosis of M. haemolytica pneumonia (RAHAL et \nal., 2014; AHMED et al., 2017). \n\nIn conclusion, stressful factors may favor \nthe development of bacterial pleuropneumonia in \ngoats of all ages, and non-hemolytic M. haemolytica \ncolonies can also generate the disease in goats under \ninadequate welfare conditions.\n\nACNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nWe are grateful to the Mozambican Instituto de \nBolsas de Estudo (IBE) and to the Brazilian, Conselho Nacional \nde Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecn\u00f3logico (CNPq) and \n\nCoordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior \n(CAPES), for the support to this work.\n\nDECLARATION   OF   CONFLICTING   \nINTERESTS\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.
