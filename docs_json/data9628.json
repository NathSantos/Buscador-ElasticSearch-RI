O \nesgotamento dos recursos naturais, pre\u00e7o pago por todas as amenidades \ncriadas, levou os governos mundiais a procurarem um acordo internacional \nque limitasse o aumento da polui\u00e7\u00e3o. A primeira tentativa a, conseguir o \nconsenso internacional foi o Protocolo de Quioto, que entrou em vigor a 16 de \nFevereiro de 2005, 90 dias ap\u00f3s a ractifica\u00e7\u00e3o da R\u00fassia. Nele, 54 pa\u00edses \nconcordaram reduzir em 20% as emiss\u00f5es dos Gases com Efeito de Estufa \n(GEE), at\u00e9 2020 e com base nas emiss\u00f5es verificadas em 1990. No \nseguimento da assinatura do Protocolo de Quioto, a Uni\u00e3o Europeia p\u00f4s em \nmarcha o seu pr\u00f3prio plano de controlo das emiss\u00f5es de carbono, designado \npor \u201cEuropean Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS)\u201d, que, desde ent\u00e3o, \ntem liderado os movimentos mundiais para o controlo do CO2. Enquadrando-se \nnas linhas gerais de Quioto, o EU-ETS foi implementado atrav\u00e9s duma \ndirectiva europeia com o objectivo global de fazer incorporar nos custos de \nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o as externalidades causadas pelas emiss\u00f5es poluentes e promover o \ninvestimento em tecnologias limpas, impondo limites m\u00e1ximos (\u201ccaps\u201d) \u00e0s \nemiss\u00f5es de cada pa\u00eds e instituindo esquemas espec\u00edficos para a \ncomercializa\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono, com vista \u00e0 mitiga\u00e7\u00e3o das emiss\u00f5es j\u00e1 emitidas. \nAlguns anos depois do lan\u00e7amento do EU-ETS, surgiram os produtos \nfinanceiros de carbono.  \n\nAt\u00e9 ao momento os mercados de emiss\u00f5es ainda n\u00e3o foram estudados de \nforma consistente, duma perspectiva financeira, e s\u00e3o ainda necess\u00e1rias \nnovas investiga\u00e7\u00f5es acad\u00e9micas sobre o tema espec\u00edfico da din\u00e2mica da \nforma\u00e7\u00e3o dos pre\u00e7os dos EUA, dos CER e de todos os restantes activos de \ncarbono, incluindo os seus derivados. \n\nAssim sendo, e com base na informa\u00e7\u00e3o publicada pela European Energy \nExchange (EEX) ao longo de um per\u00edodo de mais de cinco anos, a presente \ndisserta\u00e7\u00e3o procura avaliar qual dos mercados \u2013 spot ou forward \u2013 lidera o \nprocesso de forma\u00e7\u00e3o do pre\u00e7o do carbono. \n\nAp\u00f3s a an\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica das caracter\u00edsticas dos dados, analisaremos ao \npormenor os pre\u00e7os spot e os pre\u00e7os dos futuros de carbono, focando-nos nos \nconceitos mais importantes dos commodity markets: o convenience yield, o \npr\u00e9mio de risco e a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre estas duas vari\u00e1veis. Ao analisarmos os \npre\u00e7os dos futuros de carbono duma perspectiva ex-post para verificar se \nexiste evid\u00eancia emp\u00edrica para um pr\u00e9mio de risco positivo, conclu\u00edmos que se \nverifica uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o negativa entre os pr\u00e9mios de risco e o time-to-maturity de \ncada activo em an\u00e1lise. Ao investigarmos quais os factores que influenciam os \npr\u00e9mios de risco e o convenience yield, obtemos resultados que sugerem que \nambos s\u00e3o afectados negativamente pela volatilidade do pre\u00e7o spot, e que o \npre\u00e7o tem um impacto positivo no convenience yield; mais, vemos que no geral \nos convenience yields influenciam de forma positiva os pr\u00e9mios de risco.  \n\nSendo vari\u00e1veis os resultados obtidos em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da Fase do Protocolo Quioto \na que dizem respeito os activos analisados e das respectivas maturidades, h\u00e1 \nevid\u00eancia de que os direitos de emiss\u00e3o - e o EU-ETS em particular \u2013 parecem \nestar a atingir os resultados procurados no que diz respeito \u00e0 protec\u00e7\u00e3o do \nambiente, reduzindo os GEE. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m ind\u00edcios crescentes de que as \nincertezas quanto \u00e0 viabilidade futura do EU-ETS est\u00e3o a diminuir.  \n\nComo suporte \u00e0 defini\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edticas, destacamos a evid\u00eancia emp\u00edrica de \nque as externalidades provocadas pelos GEE j\u00e1 est\u00e3o a ser incorporadas nas \nestruturas de custo dos agentes econ\u00f3micos, nomeadamente nos pre\u00e7os da \nelectricidade. Contudo, a permiss\u00e3o do short-selling e do banking entre \nper\u00edodos sucessivos do Protocolo de Quioto poderia aumentar a liquidez e \nmelhorar a efici\u00eancia do mercado de carbono. \n\nPor \u00faltimo, os factores combust\u00edveis (carv\u00e3o, g\u00e1s e petr\u00f3leo), condi\u00e7\u00f5es \nclimat\u00e9ricas e restri\u00e7\u00f5es do mercado, revestiram-se de particular interesse ao \nevidenciar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o dos contratos de CO2 com a intensidade de consumo de \nenergia, nomeadamente com os mercados electricidade (spot e de futuros).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nCO2, Carbon-dioxide allowances, carbon pricing, carbon  futures, carbon cost-\nof-carry, carbon price discovery, market efficiency, carbon finance, global \nwarming, Green House Gas (GHG), EU ETS, Kyoto Protocol, Carbon Trading, \nEmission Unit Allowances (EUA), Certified Emission Reductions (CER), \nEuropean Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). \n\n\n\nabstract \n\n \nWorld economic development, starting with industrial revolution in the late 18th \ncentury, has led to increasing pollution levels all over the world. Depletion of \nnatural resources has been the result and the price paid for all the amenities \nand comfort bring by development. Because of this, world governments \ndecided to try to find a consensual way to control pollution escalation. The first \nsuccessful international attempt to do that is known as \u201eThe Kyoto Protocol? and \nentered into force on 16 February 2005, 90 days after its ratification by Russia. \nThere, 54 countries put forward the overall goal of reducing GHG emissions by \n20% below 1990 levels, until 2020.  \n\nFollowing Kyoto Protocol signature, European Union has implemented its own \ncarbon control scheme, the so-called European Union Emission Trading \nScheme (EU-ETS), which leads the carbon control worldwide movements, \nsince then. With the general aim of incorporating externalities caused by \npollution in the production costs and to foster investment in clean technologies, \nthe EU-ETS was launched through an EU directive. Within Kyoto framework, \nthis new EU ETS imposed emission?s caps over each European country and \nestablished specific carbon trading schemes to mitigate emitted pollution.  \n\nSome years after the launching of EU ETS, carbon financial products have also \ndeveloped all over international Stock Exchanges. So far, emission markets \nhave not yet been consistently studied from a financial point of view and we still \nhave a lack of academic work on the specific subject of pricing dynamics of the \nEUAs, CERs and other carbon assets, as well as its derivatives. \n\nSo, using European Energy Exchange data with a time spam of more than five \nyears, this thesis attempts to evaluate which market \u2013 spot or forward \u2013 leads \nthe carbon price discovery process. We focus specifically on carbon future \nprices and on carbon spot prices, analysing them in a most thorough way. \n\nAfter analyzing the statistical properties of data, we focus on the most important \nconcepts in the commodity markets: the convenience yield, the risk premium \nand the relationship between these variables, for the Exchange under analysis. \n\nWe analyze carbon futures prices from an ex-post perspective to find if there is \nevidence for significant positive risk premia and conclude that a negative \nrelationship between risk premia and time-to-maturity does exist. When testing \nfor factors influencing risk premia and convenience yields, we obtain results \nimplying that spot price volatility impact negatively both of them and that the \nprice itself impact the convenience yield in a positive way; more, generally \nconvenience yields influence risk premia in a positive way. Results change \ndepending on the Kyoto Protocol Phase and on the characteristics of the \nassets used, but seem to confirm that uncertainties about the future of the EU \nETS are disappearing. So, we can assume that allowances appear to be \nproducing the desired results, in terms of environmental protection. \n\nFor policy, empirical evidence found that there is already a pass-through of \nexternalities caused by GHG costs into the cost structure of economic agents, \ninfluencing namely electricity prices. The EU ETS seems, though, to fulfil its \ngoal of reducing GHG emitted. Nevertheless, allowing short-selling and banking \nbetween successive Kyoto periods could increase liquidity and improve market \nefficiency. \n\nFinally, the role of fuels (coal, gas and oil), weather and market constraints, \nwas found to be of particular interest relating CO2 contracts to energy \nconsumption intensity, namely to electricity spot and futures markets. \nMoreover, the recently created liberalized electricity market throughout Europe \nencouraged the development of environmental protection policies since newly \ncarbon financial contracts emerged in this context. \n \n\n \n\n\n\nTable of Contents \n\nChapter 1.

Introduction and Structure of the Thesis \n\nThe debate about greenhouse gases (GHG) still is at world spot light and the interest it \n\ncatches (from scientists, governments, enterprises and the general public) is reinforced \n\nby all natural catastrophes and climate changes impact on our everyday life, anytime \n\nsomewhere in the planet. In fact it is increasingly accepted that anthropogenic climate \n\nchange is enhanced through increased emission of pollutants such as CO2. Human \n\nactivities, in particular the development of industry and population growth over the last \n\n200 years, have caused an increase in atmospheric concentration of GHG, mainly \n\ncarbon dioxide and methane. The augmentation of these gases in the atmosphere - in \n\nitself essential to the existence of life - intensifies the natural greenhouse effect that \n\noccurs on Earth and leads to the increase in planet average temperatures. This \n\ntemperature increase causes sea-levels to rise and weather conditions to worsen, giving \n\nway to major storms, floods and droughts and causing increasingly severe disruptions \n\non climate and on Earth\u2018s life system as we know them. It is now widely accepted that \n\nall these environmental problems will have huge economic and social impact. \n\nBecause of that, climate change (CC) is no longer an issue discussed by specialists only \n\nand has become a focus of general interest among ordinary people and media. As a \n\nconsequence of all this public attention, societies, led by governments, have been trying \n\nto take action to reduce their GHG emissions either voluntarily or through regulatory \n\nconstraints. \n\nThe first international agreement on climate change has been put forward in Kyoto in \n\n1994, entered into force on 16 February 2005, after having been signed by 54 countries \n\nand has been formally adopted in 1997. It became known as the Kyoto Protocol with the \n\noverall goal of reducing GHG emissions caused by humankind. Specifically it aims to \n\nreduce carbon emissions by 20% below 1990 levels, until 2020. \n\nCC is, above all, a terrible threat in most people\u2018s minds, but beating climate change is \n\nalso a historic opportunity to turn humanity onto a path of sustainable growth for \n\neveryone around the globe. In fact, the solutions to fight against climate change and \n\n\n\nPage 6 of 92 \n\n \n\nstabilize environment will produce further economic development and will vitalize \n\neconomies, building secure, fairer and more innovative societies. So, not only we must \n\nact, but it makes no sense not to act, some authors claim. \n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union has \n\ndecided to introduce its own emission trading system, the so-called European Union \n\nEmission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which imposes over European countries specific \n\nemissions\u2018 limits. The EU directive is transposed into national law through the so-called \n\nNational Allocation Plans (NAPs) where flexible instruments allow national polluting \n\nentities for yearly efficient CO2 abatements. Through NAPs, each year emissions are \n\nreduced first where it is possible to do so at the lowest cost. \n\nThe purpose of the EU ETS is threefold:  \n\nFirst, to cut carbon emissions, through the definition of a cap fixing the amount each \n\npolluting entity can emit over a certain period of time. To respect the cap, either \n\nproduction / consumption have to be reduced or - and that is the more realistic and \n\ndesired approach - or more efficient technologies must be developed, i.e., industries \n\nmust switch to \"cleaner\" technologies.  \n\nThe second aim of the EU ETS is to internalize externalities caused by CO2 emissions: \n\na higher concentration of carbon in the atmosphere is harmful to everyone, thus people \n\nproducing CO2 should pay for it.  \n\nThird, European climate policy seeks to foster firms investment in cleaner \n\ntechnologies. \n\nBecause of all this legal, social and economic dynamics, CO2 financial markets have \n\nalso developed and carbon financial products (based on carbon emission allowances \n\nand/or carbon emission reduction credits) have been launched and started being traded \n\nwith increasing liquidity within international stock exchanges, namely those related to \n\nthe EU emissions trading scheme. Besides spot contracts, futures and options, carbon \n\nfinancial assets are also available OTC and on exchanges across Europe.  \n\nTo study the relationship between EU ETS CER and EUA spot and futures prices on \n\nEuropean Exchanges and to facilitate progressive building on knowledge, we have \n\n\n\nPage 7 of 92 \n\n \n\nchosen to structure our study in five parts: Chapter one presents the introduction and the \n\nstructure of the Thesis; Chapter two prepares the way for our main objective, presenting \n\nthe basics of Carbon Market and of Carbon Finance; Chapter three makes a quick \n\nliterature review related with our theme, allowing us to make the ?problem formulation\u2018 \n\nwe want to address; Chapter four presents the data we have used and their statistical \n\nproperties, and provides the models to be used in the empirical analysis on carbon spot \n\nand futures prices in the EEX Exchange, analyzing the  evolution of data through time \n\nand the relationship that exists between spot and future prices, illustrating the concepts \n\nof risk premiums and convenience yields in futures markets; Finally, Chapter five \n\npresents and explores the empirical results, presents some policy recommendations and \n\nconcludes. \n\n  \n\n\n\nPage 8 of 92 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2. The Basics of Carbon Market and Carbon Finance  \n\n2.1. CARBON MARKET: POLICIES, MECHANICS AND MARKET SEGMENTS \n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is an international scientific forum, \n\ncreated in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World \n\nMeteorological Organization (WMO) to help humanity deal with one of the most \n\nfundamental challenges of human History: the transition to a low-carbon economy. Its \n\nmain goal has been to provide world political leaders and thinkers with a clear scientific \n\nview on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential \n\nenvironmental and socio-economic impacts. Through a number of reports it has helped \n\ndeveloping scientific consensus on the subject.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 1: PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF KYOTO PROTOCOL PROCESS \n\nOver a decade ago, in 1992 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n\nChange (UNFCCC) has been put forward and created the umbrella framework on \n\nclimate change which set a strategic direction (?reducing greenhouse gases emissions is \n\ngood and we all should do it?). This is the largest global consensus framework ever \n\nratified - it is now signed by 194 countries \u2013 and, since then, together with the IPCC, the \n\nUNFCCC tries to influence world progress on the subject.

Carbon Emissions Control Policies \u2013 Ways of Action to Solve the \n\nProblem \n\nClimate Change issues are not consensual. Across a wide spectrum, some voices argue \n\nthat carbon emissions and climate change are not linked, while others consider one \n\noriginates the other and urge immediate concerted global action to reduce the flow of \n\nemissions into the atmosphere. Even among those that advocate for action there are not \n\nconsensus about timing, goals, and means. Despite all the controversy, one thing is \n\ncertain: any form of intensified regulation will have (and is already having) profound \n\nimplications on business. \n\n2.1.1.1. THE STABILIZATION WEDGE THEORY BY PACALA AND SOCOLOW  \n\nIn 2003, Professors Socolow and Pacala of Princeton University proposed 15 potential \n\nwedges to act over carbon emissions. They have said that to maintain the same global \n\nlevel of carbon emissions between 2004 and 2054 one would merely had to choose 7 \n\nout of the 15 wedges they propose and then implement, manage and control them along \n\nall the subsequent 50 year period. \n\nThey thought of each wedge to be one strategy. The 15 wedges (strategies) they \n\nproposed were: \n\n? To drive more efficient vehicles; \n\n? To reduce the number of vehicles on the road; \n\n? To produce more energy efficient buildings; \n\n? To make the coal power plants two times more efficient; \n\n? To switch from coal to gas in base load power production; \n\n? To capture CO2 at base load power plants and store it; \n\n? To capture CO2 at hydrogen producing power plants and store it; \n\n\n\nPage 10 of 92 \n\n \n\n? To capture CO2 at coal to syn-gas\n1\n fuel plants; \n\n? To use nuclear power instead of coal; \n\n? To use wind power instead of coal; \n\n? To use photovoltaic power instead of coal; \n\n? To use wind produced hydrogen in fuel-cell cars instead of gasoline; \n\n? To use biomass fuels instead of fossil fuels; \n\n? To reduce deforestation and afforest areas that are currently been denuded of \n\nforest; \n\n? To change agricultural methods from intensive to ?conservation tillage\u2018. \n\nIn their opinion, each wedge/strategy has different levels of efficiency and must be \n\ncarefully combined with other in order to achieve specific policy targets results. \n\n2.1.1.2. CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES \n\nIn 2006, British economist Nicholas Stern stated that the benefits of early action on \n\nclimate change considerably outweigh costs. ?Unless emissions are curbed, climate \n\nchange will bring high costs for human development, economies and the environment\u201d, \n\nhe said. The report he published \u2013 the Stern Review - concluded that resource costs \n\nrequired to avoid many of the worst impacts of climate change would be only around \n\n1% of global GDP over a 50 years period (until 2050). Additionally, in the report it was \n\nargued that the amount needed to invest would not only be a cost but would also create \n\nopportunities, would add to global competitiveness and probably would have other \n\nlateral benefits. Finally, the Stern Review argued that investment made in CC would \n\nalso avoid an expected cost of minus 5% of consumption by mitigating climate change \n\nmarket impacts and risk catastrophe (in his report\u2018s baseline climate view Nicholas \n\nStern has given each impact/risk some probability curves). \n\nStern report concluded saying that ?if we invest now, while time frames are long, we are \n\ngoing to have a return on our investment in terms of avoided costs that can be pretty \n\n                                                \n\n1\n Syn-gas is the abbreviation for Synthesis gas. This is a gas mixture that comprises of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and \n\nhydrogen. The syn-gas is produced due to the gasification of a carbon containing fuel to a gaseous product that has some heating \n\nvalue. Some of the examples of syn-gas are as follows \u2013 gasification of coal, waste to energy gasification, steam reforming of \nnatural gas to generate hydrogen. Syn gas has 50% the energy density of natural gas. \n\n\n\nPage 11 of 92 \n\n \n\nsignificant (factors between 5 and 20 times the required investment, depending upon the \n\nfuture climate scenarios and some other complex factors)?. \n\nEven though it is somewhat unusual for investors to include adaptation in their \n\ninvestment portfolio, people still have two ways of action to abate CO2 and to minimize \n\nclimate change (CC): mitigation or adaptation. \n\nAdaptation tries to solve problems caused by the carbon already emitted or the one we \n\ncannot avoid to emit (that will be emitted for sure, considering present economic and \n\nsocial conditions and outlooks). So, adaptation seeks to deal with global warming that is \n\nalready taking place or that will inevitably take place in the future. It has been driven \n\nmostly by people who believe climate change is really taking place but it is thought to \n\ninclude more and more governments in a near future. Water is one of the most important \n\nadaptation sectors for investment within climate change. Others are population growth \n\nand infrastructure issues. An exhaustive perspective would be: \n\n \n\nMitigation focuses on how to stop the carbon from being emitted (or on how to reduce \n\ncarbon emission levels) and tries to change present and future behaviors. Mitigation \n\nsectors include the alternative energies and cleantech sector projects, namely: Power, \n\nEnergy Efficiency, Transportation, Buildings, Industry, Agriculture, Waste and \n\nForestry. Classic Clean Technologies: Solar, Wind, Water, Geothermal, Bioenergies, \n\nother clean technologies. \n\nHowever, it is commonly agreed upon that effective action on Climate Change will \n\nrequire: long-term quantity goals, joint efforts to limit costs, a broadly comparable \n\n\n\nPage 12 of 92 \n\n \n\ninternational price for carbon, cooperation to develop efficient clean technology, \n\neffective regulation and fair distribution of effort among all international players. All \n\nseasoned with good standards, transparency, political persuasion and, finally, a good \n\npublic understanding of actions and policies implemented. \n\n2.1.2. The Kyoto Protocol Mechanics \n\nKyoto Protocol (KP) addresses both carbon adaptation and carbon mitigation and \n\nfunctions based on a ?shortage\u2018, a need for carbon assets, artificially created by KP \n\nsigning parties through emissions limitation, formally entered into the Protocol. It \n\n?imposes\u2018 carbon emissions limits over governments for those countries who have \n\nratified it - both the industrialized and the transition ones - who, in turn, restricts \n\nemissions of national entities through the so-called ?grandfathering? of permits. This \n\nentails providing permits to firms for free, on the basis of its historical emissions \n\nalthough keeping in mind the aim of progressive carbon emissions reduction, one year \n\nafter another. Cap limit is the lever controlled by governments, who control the supply \n\nof credits received. \n\nBy ratifying Kyoto Protocol, governments accept these limits and impose them on \n\ndomestic market actors, negotiating allocation plans and allocating each company an \n\namount of credits for every year. Entities that, for whatever reason, emit less in a given \n\nyear than the emitting limits they have, can take the exceeding amount of credits they \n\ndidn\u2018t use (as a result of emitting less) or those they generate (as a result of investing in \n\nCDM\n2\n or JI\n\n3\n projects) and sell them to a company who is going to emit more. \n\nKyoto Protocol implementation has been organized in three different periods. Phase \n\nOne of Kyoto Protocol began in 2005 with Russia\u2018s ratification and ran until December \n\n2007. Phase II, the Kyoto commitment period, has started about three years ago and it \n\nwill end in 2012. Discussions to find an agreement for a third period are under way but \n\nhave already experienced some difficulties. The so-called Post-Kyoto Phase is expected \n\n                                                \n\n2\n Clean Development Mechanism (see \u00a7 4 hereafter). \n\n3\n Joint Implementation Projects (see \u00a7 4 hereafter). \n\n\n\nPage 13 of 92 \n\n \n\nto run from 2013 to 2020, but its details are still subject to the results of those \n\nnegotiations (the first attempt to reach a deal has been a public failure, at Copenhagen \n\n2009, followed by the recent Cancun 2010 world meeting on Climate Change).  \n\nTo help each country meet the specific carbon target it has been given (carbon \n\nreductions targets, measurable emission caps that governments have to reach against a \n\n1990 ?baseline\u2018 or starting point), Kyoto Protocol introduced the well known ?emission \n\nallowances? together with three flexibility mechanisms. These ?Flex Mex\u2018, as they are \n\ncalled - aimed at GHG emissions reductions and viewed both as critical and innovative - \n\nallow governments to interchange and to trade their carbon credits among each other; \n\nthen, governments allow their own economic actors to do the same. The Flex Mex are \n\nconsidered to be the reason behind all the interest in terms of carbon investment, carbon \n\ntrading and carbon finance.  \n\nKyoto Protocol incorporates three types of flexible mechanisms, which are: the clean \n\ndevelopment mechanism (CDM), joint implementation projects (JI), and international \n\nemissions trading (IET). CDMs are mechanisms through which investment can be made \n\nby historic carbon emitters \u2013 developed countries -, to help developing world new \n\ninfrastructures to become less carbon intense. They constitute a kind of a ?steam valve\u2018 \n\nthat ties together efficiency (in terms of marginal abatement cost), responsibility and \n\nequity. Along with CDM we have JI projects, which allow industrialized\n4\n or transition \n\ncountries to jointly invest in emission reduction projects in other industrialized and \n\ntransition countries. For emission reductions resulting from JI and CDM projects, \n\ncountries are granted Emission Reduction Units (ERU) and Certified Emission \n\nReductions (CER) respectively, which they may use to comply with their emission caps. \n\nUnlike CDM, which generates additional reductions, JI projects only allow carbon \n\nallowances transfer from one country to another; thus, the total authorized emission \n\nlevel remains the same after the implementation of a JI offset project. IET allows for \n\nemissions trading between governments resulting from country\u2018s carbon allowances \n\nsurplus/deficit. \n\n                                                \n\n4\n Very often the industrialized countries are referred to as Kyoto Protocol annex B countries. \n\n\n\nPage 14 of 92 \n\n \n\n2.1.2.1. TYPES OF KYOTO COMPLIANCE UNITS \n\nThere are several kinds of Kyoto compliance units which have the same value in terms \n\nof carbon control: Assigned Amount Units (AAUs), Certified Emissions Reductions \n\n(CERs), Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) and Removal Units (RMUs).  \n\n? AAUs are the total budget of emission units assigned to each nation for a given \n\nperiod of time, resulting from the specific Kyoto Protocol reduction target that has \n\nbeen negotiated.  \n\n? EUA is the EU ETS emissions\u2018 unit which has been thought of to be equivalent to a \n\nunit of carbon emissions under Kyoto Protocol. That is, an emission permit for a ton \n\nof CO2e\n5\n in the EU ETS, known as a European Union Allowance (EUA), is fungible \n\nwith the Kyoto permits that governments use to comply with their Kyoto targets.  \n\n? CERs are additional carbon emission permits that states or polluting entities may \n\nobtain through the CDM Kyoto Flexible Mechanisms, designed to help developing \n\ncountries reduce their dependency on GHG emissions as their economies grow.  \n\nCERs are created by a firm or an Annex B\n6\n country\u2018s investing in a CO2e-reduction \n\ntechnology in a developing country project that would not have occurred otherwise. \n\nCERs are thus intended to work as carbon offset credits and offer developed \n\ncountries the opportunity to access cheaper abatement opportunities than might \n\nexist domestically, by helping non-Annex I\n7\n countries mitigating their carbon \n\nproduction. Largely because of their attractiveness as a source of cheap offsets, \n\ndemand for CERs among European firms has been growing substantially since the \n\nEU ETS began. The supply however, has been constrained by the EC because of \n\ndoubts about if CDM projects are actually contributing to real emissions reductions. \n\n                                                \n\n5\n CO2e stands for CO2 equivalent units of any greenhouse gas. \n\n6\n Annex B in the Kyoto Protocol lists those developed countries that have committed themselves to control their greenhouse gas \n\nemissions in the period 2008\u201312, including those in the OECD, Central and Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation. The list of \n\nAnnex B countries currently (2007) matches that of Annex I, with the exclusion of Turkey  (UNFCC) \n\n7\n By default the countries other than those of the Annex I, are referred to as Non-Annex I countries. Annex I to the UNFCCC lists \n\nall the countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in 1990, plus countries with ?economies in \n\ntransition\u2018, Central and Eastern Europe (excluding Albania and most of the former Yugoslavia).  Under Article 4.2 (a and b) of the \n\nConvention, Annex I countries commit themselves specifically to the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels of \nGHG emissions by the year 2000. (UNFCC). Non-Annex I countries are developing countries recognized by the Convention. \n\n\n\nPage 15 of 92 \n\n \n\nTherefore, the EC examines all CERs created from CDM projects thoroughly \n\nbefore admitting them into market circulation as fungible carbon credits. \n\n? Finally, ERUs are credits similar in nature to CERs, except they are offset credits \n\nthat are created by the investment in carbon technology by one Annex B country in \n\nanother Annex B country through the Kyoto Protocols Joint Implementation (JI) \n\nprograms. Intended to provide a similar function to that of CERs, JIs have been \n\nspecifically relevant in the former soviet states of Eastern Europe; nevertheless, its \n\nmarket volume has been extremely small since carbon emission trading schemes \n\nbegan.  \n\n \n\nFIGURE 2: CARBON ASSETS AMOUNTS SURRENDERED IN YEAR 2008 (EUROPE) \n\n? Specific to LULUCF\n8\n we still have Removal Units (RMU), which are generated \n\nin Annex B parties by LULUCF activities that absorb carbon dioxide. Annex B \n\nParties can use RMUs to help meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments. \n\n2.1.3. World Carbon Markets \n\nThere is not one carbon market in the world, but many carbon markets. In a way, we can \n\nthink about them as carbon ?currencies?. \n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is the bigger world carbon ?currency\u2018 market whose total ?capital \n\nstock\u2018 is around 60 billion tons of CO2. Within Kyoto Protocol each government hold in \n\na government ?account\u2018 or register its own AAU (European countries have 26,2 billion \n\nof these AAU ?carbon units\u2018, a part of which are distributed through the EU ETS).   \n\nAdditionally to the big 57 billion Kyoto allowances market, we have the Kyoto Protocol \n\nFlexible Mechanisms ?currencies\u2018 (CER, ERU and RMU) which are ?created? by \n\nemitting entities investing in CDM, JI or LULUCF projects and add to the AAU market. \n\n                                                \n\n8\n Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry projects. \n\nTotal surrenders for 2008 2.075.245.163 100,00%\n\nCERs and ERUs 81.717.146 3,90%\n\n2008 free allowances 1.908.402.867 92,00%\n\n2009 allowances or allowances \n\np urchased at auction 85.125.150 4,10%\n\nS o urc e : Euro pe a n C o m m is s io n; IP /09/794; M a y 2009\n\n\n\nPage 16 of 92 \n\n \n\nThe Flex Mex market is estimated to value between 1,5 and 2 million CO2e tons \n\n(coming mainly from CDM and JI projects). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 3: WORLD CARBON MARKET SEGMENTS \n\nThe most significant CDM and JI greenhouse gas reduction project types (or Project \n\nClasses) include industrial gas\n9\n projects (the biggest class because of its projects being \n\nthe cheapest to be implemented), renewable energy projects (second largest class; may \n\ngrow to be the largest as the industrial gas projects start being finished), methane \n\nreduction projects (third class; mainly from cement plants, coal mines and waste \n\ntreatment processes and storage), energy efficiency, fuel switching, transportation and \n\nbiomass (afforestation/reforestation projects).  \n\nThe cost of reducing one ton of CO2 is very different from company to company, from \n\nsector to sector and from country to country. Therefore, there are companies that will \n\nfind it cheaper to invest in reducing their own emissions and others that will prefer to \n\ninvest in their suppliers\u2018 reduction or in developing countries projects (CDM and JI, \n\ne.g.).  Each one must find their best and most efficient way, starting by ?the low hanging \n\nfruit\u2018, the cheapest emission reductions. \n\n                                                \n\n9\n Examples of industrial gas projects are the HFC-23 and N2O reduction projects. \n\n$10 price trigger \n\nCompliance with EU ETS \n\nPrivate installation buying \n\nGovernment \n\ncompliance buying \n\nKyoto: 57 Billion AAUs \n\ndistributed amongst 36 countries \n\nEU: 26,2 \n\nBillion AAUs  \n\nRGGI  \n\nEU ETS: 10,4 \n\nBillion AAUs  \n\nKyoto Flexible \n\nMechanisms \n\n(mainly CDM and JI \n\nprojects)  \n\nEU: Other \n\nPolicies  \n\n\n\nPage 17 of 92 \n\n \n\nIn 2007 the Clean Development Mechanisms were expected to have a capital stock of \n\naround 2 billion Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits coming fro m around 1.600 \n\nprojects. In that same year (2007) the World Bank estimated the amount of capital \n\ncommitted to CDM projects to be about 12 billion USD (US Dollars) and the capital \n\nready for investment in this kind of projects to be over 20 billion USD. \n\n2.1.4. The EU ETS Market \n\nUnder Kyoto Protocol, European Union has committed itself to reduce its GHG \n\nemissions by 8% below 1990 year levels, during the period 2008 - 2012.  \n\nSeeking to jointly achieve their Kyoto goals in a cost-efficient way, EU member states \n\nimplemented the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS), a Europe-wide \n\ncap and trade scheme launched in 2005. Formerly referred to as the EU Emissions \n\nTrading Scheme, the EU ETS is based on progressive carbon emissions reduction like \n\nKyoto Protocol and is the largest single market in the world emission allowances \n\ntrading. Considered the first of its kind, it accounted for approximately 67 billion Euros \n\nin 2008. \n\nThe Directive 2003/87/EC, enforced on 25 October 2003, did not include all sources of \n\nemissions on the EU ETS. Initial covered sectors were: installations in the energy and \n\nindustrial sectors (specifically combustion energy activities and biomass plants with a \n\nrated thermal capacity greater than or equal to 20 MWh), mineral oil refineries and coke \n\novens, ferrous metal production, cement and lime, bricks and ceramics, glass, pulp and \n\npaper. At first, transport, aviation, land use change, forestry, and wastes were not \n\ncovered by the scheme. After having enlarged its initial coverage, the EU ETS currently \n\nincludes more than 12,000 installations in the 27 EU Member States, accounting for \n\naround 55 % of the EU\u2018s total CO2 emissions and about 30% of its overall GHG \n\nemissions. The majority of these emissions covered \u2013 approximately 60% \u2013 belong to \n\nthe EU\u2018s 200 electricity generators which form the biggest single sector in the carbon \n\npermits market.  \n\n\n\nPage 18 of 92 \n\n \n\nBeyond the EU ETS market we still find in Europe the \u2018Other Policies\u2018 market, called \n\nthe ?non-regulated market\u2018, which comes mainly from transport and heating and \n\nrepresents 45% of Europe\u2018s total GHG emissions.  \n\n2.1.4.1. THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EU ETS \n\nEuropean Commission (EC) is the institution responsible for setting the cap on the total \n\nnet emissions allowed within the EU ETS. After deciding the total number of European \n\nUnion Allowances (EUA)\n10\n\n to deliver for each Phase, EC allocates to EU member states \n\neach own annual quotas, making it available at the start of each year (in February). \n\nAfterwards, usually by the end of March of each compliance year, the member state \n\ngovernment submits to the approval of the EC its own National Allocation Plan (NAP).  \n\nTo enforce the emissions\u2018 cap, after analyzing their actual emission volumes over the \n\nprevious year, at the end of compliance year (on April 30th) the EU requires entities \n\ncovered by the scheme to hold and convey one emission permit for each ton of CO2e\n11\n\n \n\nemitted. So, after receiving its permits allocations, each emitting entity must evaluate its \n\nestimated emissions for the year ahead; if they estimate to exceed their allocated EUAs, \n\ncompanies have two possibilities: they may either abate some of their emissio ns or buy \n\non the market the EUAs\n12\n\n they lack. The intended effect is that companies with cheap \n\nabatement opportunities will abate more CO2 and sell the exceeding EUAs in the market \n\nto companies for which abatement is more costly.  \n\nCompliance is enforced by a rigorous financial penalty per missing permit and a \n\nrequirement to cover any deficit resulting from a compliance failure, through the \n\nsurrendering of additional permits in excess of compliance needs in the following year. \n\nThus, the penalty is not a cap\u2018s price but a strict disincentive to non-compliance: if \n\ncompanies fail to comply, they have to pay the penalty and must also deliver the \n\n                                                \n\n10\n One EUA allows for the emission of one ton of CO2 in each calendar year. \n\n11\n ?CO2e? carbon dioxide equivalent unit is the common carbon standardized measurement; is the unit in which greenhouse gas \n\nemissions are measured under the Kyoto Protocol. It includes all 6 gas types identified by Kyoto as having high global warmin g \n\npotential: carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (MH4), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and \n\nsulphur hexafluoride (SF6). \n\n12\n Keep in mind that companies may also use CERs and ERUs generated from CDM and JI projects for compliance instead of \n\nEUAs.  \n\n\n\nPage 19 of 92 \n\n \n\nmissing EUAs in the following year. For the period 2005-2007 the penalty has been 40 \n\nEuros but it has been raised to 100 Euros/ton\n13\n\n, from 2008 onwards. \n\nEuropean Commission monitors the trading and surrendering of carbon permits through \n\na European wide system of company accounts. Once firms have obtained their annual \n\nallocation they are free to trade it on the market, through any of the Carbon Exchanges \n\nthat have emerged with the EU ETS: European Climate Exchange (ECX London), \n\nEuropean Energy Exchange (EEX, Leipzig), Blue Next (Paris), NordPool (Oslo), etc.. \n\nAccording to PointCarbon, besides these four European exchanges, there are two other \n\nworld leading exchanges in term of volumes traded: the Green Exchange (Nymex, \n\nNewYork) and the Energy Exchange Austria (EEA, Wien).  \n\nOther than emissions of carbon dioxide, at first, from 2008 onwards the EU ETS also \n\nincludes emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), resulting from the production of nitric acid \n\nin the Netherlands and in Norway. \n\n2.1.4.1. EU ETS BANKING AND BORROWING LIMITATIONS \n\nEUAs can be traded freely between states and, with some restrictions, pollutant entities \n\ncan ?bank\n14\n\n? or ?borrow? allowances and credits from one compliance year to another. \n\nUsing the permits saved in previous periods to comply with next period needs (or \n\nselling them on the market) is called ?banking?.  \n\nHowever, banking is allowed only between compliance periods belonging to the same \n\nPhase of the ETS, and it is strictly prohibited between Phases. This major restriction is \n\ncommonly known as the trading period break: EUAs that were issued in a previous \n\ntrading period (2005 \u2013 2007 or 2008-2012) were valid only during that same trading \n\nperiod\n15\n\n and could not be used for the subsequent trading period, the Kyoto \n\ncommitment period (2008 - 2012) or the post-Kyoto period. Figure 4 below shows the \n\n                                                \n\n13\n Refer to International Network for Sustainable Energy and to www.ourclimate.eu  \n\n14\n The act of storing a EUA for later usage is commonly called banking. The act of emitting more than the allocated cap and using \n\npermits from the following period to cover excess emissions is called borrowing. \n\n15\n France and Poland initially allowed for limited banking between 2007 and 2008, but later decided to ban inter -period transfer as \n\ndid all other members. \n\n\n\nPage 20 of 92 \n\n \n\neffect of the prohibition banking between Phase I and Phase II for different futures \n\nprices. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4: HISTORIC PRICE EVOLUTION OF CARBON ASSETS (EEX, ECX, BN AND PN EXCHANGES) \n\nThe series show EEX, ECX and BlueNext carbon futures contracts quotations from \n\nApril 2005 to October 2009 with different maturities. The sharp drop on the price we \n\nobserve at the beginning of 2007 is the result of non-bankability of permits from Phase I \n\ninto Phase II, which meant that the underlying spot price was not a valid reference for \n\nthe ensuing period. This also meant that any possible arbitrage between spot and 2008 \n\nfutures contract prior to the issuance of Phase II permits was not possible. \n\nThe opposite approach of ?banking? is called ?borrowing\n16\n\n? and is also possible. Since \n\ncompanies obtain their EUAs for the current year at the end of February and the \n\ncompliance date is only on April 30th, they may use them to comply with the preceding \n\nyear\u2018s requirements. For example, firms are allocated their yearly allowances in March \n\neach year. However, to help firms avoid being caught short of permits at compliance \n\ndate, the European Commission requires surrendering of compliance permits for the \n\nyear just ended only on April of the following year. Thus, it is always possible for firms \n\nto take a portion of their next year\u2018s allocation and use it for the previous year\u2018s \n\ncompliance, should they need to. In this way borrowing from future years within a \n\n                                                \n\n16\n Borrowing a EUA is to use at the present compliance year a carbon permission unit delivered for compliance in a future year. \n\n\n\nPage 21 of 92 \n\n \n\nPhase can occur. Similarly to the banking restrictions, permits may be borrowed from \n\nfuture years within Phases, but not between Phases. \n\n2.1.4.2. EU ETS PHASE III \n\nSince regulation issues are critical to carbon price development, we will summarize in \n\nthis section the most important regulatory cornerstones for the third period of EU ETS \n\n(and Kyoto Protocol). The diagram below displays its decision making process, until \n\n2013.  \n\n \nFIGURE 5: TIME SCHEDULE FOR KYOTO THIRD PERIOD \n\nWith the third period agreement in perspective, in January 2008 the European \n\nCommission has put forward its climate and energy proposal. Following agreement \n\namong Member states and the European Parliament, a revised EU ETS Directive for \n\nPhase III was put forward on 17 December 2008, as part of the wider EU 2020 Climate \n\n&amp; Energy Package. The so-called 20-20-20 policy is to be reached by 2020 and consists \n\nin a three wedge policy: \n\n? 20% reduction in emissions for the European countries by the year 2020; \n\n? 20% renewable energy target-share by the year 2020; \n\n? 20% net energy efficiency gains by the year 2020 (through increased \n\nefficiency, energy use reduction through other measures). \n\nFurther, in order to demonstrate its leadership, to challenge and to encourage broad \n\nparticipations in the post-Kyoto low carbon world, Europe has announced that, if the \n\n\n\nPage 22 of 92 \n\n \n\nworld actively engages in this challenging quest, it would raise its own GHG reduction \n\ntarget to 30% by year 2020. \n\nBuilding on learning from the first and second periods and with the objective of \n\nimproving the EU ETS design in such a way that it will be more efficient, more \n\nharmonized and fairer, the revised CO2 Emissions Trading Directive becomes more \n\nenvironmentally ambitious, foreseeing some important changes for the third trading \n\nperiod, starting in 2013. Its goal is to keep the EU on track to cut 60-80 percent \n\nemissions by year 2050, so that it raises emissions reduction targets and delivers more \n\npredictable market conditions and more certainty for industry. \n\nKey elements of the Revised EU ETS Directive are:  \n\n? Compliance periods length will be enlarged from 5 to 8 years. \n\n? A centralized, EU-wide cap on emissions (compared with the current system of \n\nNational Allocation Plans set by individual Member States). The cap will follow a \n\ndeclining trajectory from 2013 onwards, being annually reduced by 1.74% of the \n\naverage annual level of the Phase II cap. It will deliver an overall reduction of \n\n21% below 2005 verified emissions by 2020.  \n\n? A significant increase in auctioning levels, to ensure that carbon cost is better \n\nintegrated into business decisions. During the first two periods, most certificates \n\nwere allocated for free. However, some industries, such as electricity generators, \n\nare able to pass on to customers the opportunity costs of CO2, generating extra \n\nprofits. So, a decision is taken that at least 60% of allowances will be auctioned \n\nby 2020, compared to around 3% in Phase II. Moreover, there will be 100% \n\nauctioning to the power sector, across most of the EU.  \n\n? 300 million allowances from the New Entrant Reserve will be made available \n\nuntil the end of 2015 to co-fund up to 12 commercial scale demonstrations of \n\nenvironmentally safe Carbon Capture and Storage and renewable energy \n\ntechnologies, in order to provide an incentive for their rapid development. This is \n\nthought to put the EU at the forefront of the development of CCS technology. \n\n\n\nPage 23 of 92 \n\n \n\nRegarding banking possibilities for the third period, at first the common view at the \n\nbeginning of 2008, was that only certificates from CDM/JI-projects delivered pre-2013 \n\ncould be included in phase III, within certain limits. However, the rights to use CERs \n\nhave been extended by the revised EU Directive and a limited quantity is allowed to be \n\nused in such a way that the overall liability with these credits does not exceed 50% of \n\nthe EU-wide regarding the 2008-2020 period reductions. Further, based on the argument \n\nthat stricter emission reductions can be achieved only within an international agreement, \n\nthe generation of new CERs in the third period will be allowed only if an international \n\nagreement on a Kyoto follower carbon protocol is reached. \n\n2.1.5. Voluntary Markets \n\nBesides Kyoto Protocol related markets, we still have the so-called Voluntary Carbon \n\nMarkets (appearing everywhere, in Australia, China, Russia, etc.). Voluntary markets \n\ninclude any non-regulated carbon market having firm or fixed emissions targets, \n\nincluding any GHG emitting activity of an unregulated firm or one which does not have \n\nto comply with one of the previously described carbon markets.  \n\nWCI RGGI ASIA-PACIFIC \n\nMARKET \n\n50% of the EU ETS market; \n\nIs the largest carbon trading \n\nmarket in North America; \n\nUntil 2012 will cover only \n\nelectricity generation and \n\nconsumption; \n\nUntil 2015 will add \n\ntransportation and heating \n\nfuel. \n\nIs the USA regional cap-and-trade \n\nprogram of 10 northwestern states \n\n(Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, \n\nMaryland, Massachusetts, New \n\nHampshire, New Jersey, New York, \n\nRhode Island, and Vermont); \n\nFist auction was on Sept.25, 2008; \n\nNot restricted to RGGI companies;  \n\nAny interested entity can buy; \n\nIf total demand is inferior to supply of \n\nallowances  allowances price will be \n\n$1,86/ton (this is called the reserve price); \n\nOn August 26, 2008 the Chicago Climate \n\nExchange (CCX) launched: \n\n? RGGI allowance futures contract \n\n? RGGI options contract. \n\nNew South Wales (Australia) \n\ntargeting power sector; \n\nAustralian government green \n\npaper (cap-and-trade schemes); \n\nNew Zealand ETS covering \n\nforestry sector (January 2008); \n\nother sectors to be phased in by \n\n2013. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 6: WORLD CARBON VOLUNTARY MARKETS \n\n\n\nPage 24 of 92 \n\n \n\nOne of these Voluntary Carbon Markets is the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, \n\nformed by an association of 10 US States cooperating to reduce their GHG emissions. It \n\nis the first organized market created in the U.S. and has begun its own ETS in 2008, \n\nhaving a CO2 futures market already underway. At present there is no established flow \n\nof Kyoto credits into the RGGI system but there can be if the price of the RGGI carbon \n\nunits goes above 10 USD. \n\nIn year 2006 these markets were estimated to be around a factor of 100 less than what \n\nwas traded in the regulated markets. Nevertheless, they have the advantage of preparing \n\nthe way for carbon emission reductions, helping to spur innovation and presenting \n\nspecific emission caps / trading regulated allowances more appropriate to deliver the \n\nscale of change required within a limited time frame. \n\nAround the world we can find the following most significant voluntary carbon markets: \n\n? The North American Western Climate Initiative (WCI), in the United States and Canada; \n\n? The North American Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), in the USA; \n\n? The Asia-Pacific Carbon Market. \n\nVoluntary markets are fast growing markets. Committed to reduce GHG emissions 6% \n\nbelow the baseline period of 1998-2001, by 2010, Chicago Climate Exchange Carbon \n\nFinancial Instruments alone accounted for a trading volume of 72 million USD in 2007 \n\n(with similar volume in the first 3 months of 2008). In 2007 it has been expanded to list: \n\n? futures on CER contracts; \n\n? futures on AAU/EUA contracts; \n\n? CER options; \n\n? futures and options on RGGI (in 2008); \n\nVoluntary markets also include project-derived carbon credits for voluntary end users \n\n(not generated under a regulatory scheme), which comprise verified emissions \n\nreductions (VERs), non-verified emission reductions (ERs) and prospective emission \n\nreductions (PERs). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPage 25 of 92 \n\n \n\n2.2. FUNDAMENTALS OF CARBON FINANCE \n\nIncreased levels of uncertainty and risk resulting from Kyoto Protocol Emissions \n\nTrading Systems implemented around the world have caused higher costs to companies. \n\nTo help them deal with these new issues, a set of proper financial tools has developed \n\nand a whole new financial area of research has appeared. With new financial assets to \n\nbe managed and new financial instruments to be learned Carbon Finance was born. \n\n2.2.1. Carbon Finance \u2013 a definition \n\nCarbon finance can be defined in many different ways and there are many different \n\ndefinitions we can refer to. A few examples follow. \n\nThe World Bank Carbon Finance Unit offers us a somewhat traditional, transaction-\n\nbased definition for carbon finance:  \n\nCarbon finance is basically a payment to a project entity (any legal entity, public or private, NGO, etc.) for the \n\nemission reductions units/certificates  from that project, once the project is operational and typically at a yearly \n\nbasis, like a commercial transaction. \u2026 carbon finance provides a means of leveraging new private and public \n\ninvestment into projects in developing countries and economies in transition that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, \n\nthereby mitigating climate change while contributing to sustainable development. \n\nSonia Labatt and Rodney R. White, in their book on carbon finance\n17\n\n, put forward the \n\nfollowing definition of carbon finance: \n\nCarbon finance explores the financial implications of living in a carbon constrained world \u2013 a world in which \n\nemissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases carry a price. Thus, carbon finance: 1) Represents one \n\nspecific dimension of environmental finance. 2) Explores the financial risks and opportunities associated with a \n\ncarbon constrained society. 3) Anticipates the availability and use of market-based instruments that are capable of \n\ntransferring environmental risk and achieving environmental objectives. \n\nThe Yale University publication ?Carbon Finance: Environmental Market Solutions to \n\nClimate Change? proposes us a collection of definitions and usages. A few examples: \n\nIn its Preface, Stewart Hudson approaches this topic directly: \n\n                                                \n\n17\n Carbon Finance: The Financial Implications of Climate Change, Wiley Finance, ISBN: 978-0-471-79467-7, April 2007. \n\n\n\nPage 26 of 92 \n\n \n\n\u2026 carbon finance has several different features. The first involves developing a market that trades in two new \n\ncommodities \u2013 carbon allowances and their close cousins, carbon offsets. A second feature of carbon finance relates \n\nto investment. \u2026 carbon finance has a research element, one that will lead to a better understanding of how private \n\nfirms have positioned themselves for success in a clean energy economy, or more troubling, how they have failed to \n\ndo so. Assessments of carbon risk and reward, and the readiness of corporate firms to profit from the transition to a \n\nlow carbon future, will \u2026  affect the trading and investment prospects inherent in what we mean by carbon finance. \n\nIn Chapter 13 of Yale\u2018s book, Andrew Aulisi employs the term carbon finance to specifically mean carbon pricing, \n\nor transactions associated with CO2 credits. He remarks, for instance, that carbon pricing or carbon finance is really \n\njust one facet of a much more complex issue. \n\nFinally, if we report to Wikipedia\n18\n\n, we can find a broader definition: \n\nCarbon finance is a new branch of Environmental Finance. Carbon finance explores the financial implications of \n\nliving in a carbon-constrained world, a world in which emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases \n\n(GHGs) carry a price. Financial risks and opportunities impact corporate balance sheets, and market -based \n\ninstruments are capable of transferring environmental risk and achieving environmental objectives. Issues regarding \n\nclimate change and GHG emissions must be addressed as part of strategic management decision-making. \n\nThe general term Carbon finance  is applied to investments in GHG emission reduction projects and (to) the creation \n\n(origination) of financial instruments that are traded on the carbon market. \n\nWhether carbon finance is in fact a narrow or a broad term, a simple revenue stream or a \n\ncomplex instrument, a transactional or a general approach to solve environmental \n\nproblems and climate change, or some combination of all of these, most of these and \n\nother definitions try, above all, to illustrate that finance, in general, can be an important \n\ntool to include in the climate change solution set that the world needs to put forward. \n\n2.2.2. Commodity Likeness \n\nUsually, within Economics literature, the term ?commodity? refers to a physical good, \n\nsuch as food, oil, corn or gold, which are bought and sold in markets, often through \n\nderivatives contracts. A commodity is thus a product which is traded on a commodity \n\nexchange. \n\nCarbon allowances are not physical products. They are immaterial assets needed only \n\nbecause of governments\u2018 actions and because of legislation, when caps were imposed \n\n                                                \n\n18\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_finance \n\n\n\nPage 27 of 92 \n\n \n\non emissions and each polluting entity is asked to convey a permit per each ton of GHG \n\nproduced. If industries pollute less than the amount of allowances they have got, they \n\ncan trade the surplus through spot, forward, future or options contracts. Allowances\u2018 \n\nprice is determined by difference between allowed and real emissions, meaning by \n\nmarket equilibrium between offer and demand. So, when an industry has more \n\nallowances than actual emissions it will cash them out on the market, if it is short on \n\nallowances it will buy more on the market. \n\nHence, carbon allowances are assets representing the right to pollute the environment, a \n\nright formally guaranteed by governments and given to different industries depending \n\non their own polluting historic profile. Carbon allowances are like a commodity. And its \n\nprice can be understood as the cost that must be paid to benefit from the possibility to \n\nsurpass the permissions\u2018 amount that has been given. Thus, it is the marginal cost of \n\npolluting the environment or the marginal gain of reducing the GHG emissions and an \n\nindependent (financial) investor can perceive the money he invests on the carbon market \n\nas a physical tool that can be used to help reducing carbon emissions at the same time it \n\ngenerates financial returns to him. \n\n2.2.3. The Convenience Yield \n\nCommonly, in Finance literature, the convenience yield is a measure of the added value \n\nor premium associated with holding an asset, instead of detaining its term contract (i.e. \n\nforward, future or option). Because of relative scarcity of the product, of strong demand \n\nor of hazardous market movements, sometimes, holding the underlying asset may \n\nbecome more profitable than carrying the contract or derivative instrument.  \n\nBy choosing to hold the physical good instead of its term contract, the agent has the \n\noption regarding consumption and no risk of commodity shortage. However, often the \n\ndecision to postpone consumption implies storage expenses. The net cost per unit of \n\ntime between the benefits of postponing the consumption and the costs of storing the \n\nproduct is termed the convenience yield. A good example is the actual purchasing of \n\nphysical barrels of oil instead of its future contracts. In the hypothesis of a sudden oil \n\noffer reduction due to OPEC\u2018s production downgrade decision, the difference between \n\n\n\nPage 28 of 92 \n\n \n\ninitial oil purchasing price (plus its storing costs) and the price after OPEC\u2018s decision \n\nwould be the convenience yield.  \n\nIt is though easy to understand that GHG allowances are, in fact, a classic commodity \n\nlike oil, gas or gold. The only difference is that for CO2 allowances there are no storing \n\ncosts. So we must find similarities in its economic fundamentals. \n\n2.2.4. Carbon Assets Trading  \n\nWithin Kyoto Protocol framework to get the amount of allowances and/or credits \n\nneeded to offset their emissions and respect their defined carbon targets, emitting \n\nentities may choose between: \n\n? implementing internal emissions abatement schemes, or  \n\n? launching external strategies (namely by participating in emissions trading or \n\nin JI and CDM projects). \n\nTo choose which carbon control strategy they must choose, polluting companies must \n\nstart by taking into consideration carbon allowances\u2018 price and their own internal \n\nemissions abatement costs level. Because of internal abatement costs becoming higher \n\nand higher, emissions trading schemes are getting increasingly popular policy \n\ninstruments through which both national and local governments around the globe seek \n\nto move their economies to a model of growth that doesn\u2018t cause unsustainable \n\nquantities of CO2 and other GHGs emitted into the atmosphere.  \n\nA research by Point Carbon (Point Carbon, 2008) among a sample of ETS market \n\noperators, indicates that 33% of them were GHG emitting companies regulated by a \n\nETS, 32% were CER generators, 15% were Financial &amp; Banking Institutions, 3% were \n\nfrom Governmental Organizations, 3% were companies from outside the ETS and 14% \n\nhad other non specified objectives. So, not all the operators pursue their compliance \n\nobjective through trading.  Furthermore, according to the World Bank the most active \n\ncarbon market participants are large power companies, banks and investment funds. \n\n(Gagliardi &amp; Sehest; 2008).  \n\n\n\nPage 29 of 92 \n\n \n\nCarbon trading market covers transactions of GHG emission allowances and of project-\n\nbased emission reductions credits. We can summarize the types of carbon assets \n\navailable for trading these days as presented in Figure 7 below. \n\nFIGURE 7: CARBON ASSETS TYPOLOGIES \n\nAccording to its financial relevance we can find three types of carbon assets: \n\n? Primary CERs and primary ERUs (purchased on a forwarded basis and prior \n\nto certification; carry project delivery risk); \n\n? Secondary CERs and secondary ERUs (traded in the futures and in the \n\nforwarded markets; volume is guaranteed). \n\n? Carbon Emission Allowances (emission caps accepted by governments under \n\nKyoto Protocol). \n\nThe trading of emission allowances focus on formal, specific carbon products, created \n\nunder the Kyoto Protocol (Assigned Amount Units and European Units Allowances, for \n\n                                                \n\n19\n The underlying value for every typology of these carbon assets is one ton of CO2-equivalent emissions. \n\n20\n Joint Implementation projects (see title 2.1.2.) \n\n21\n Clean Development Mechanism (see title 2.1.2.) \n\n22\n Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Projects. Under Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol, Parties decided that greenhouse gas \n\nremovals and emissions through certain activities \u2014 namely, afforestation and reforestation since 1990 \u2014 are accounted for in \n\nmeeting Kyoto Protocol\u2018s emission targets. Conversely, emissions from deforestation activities will be subtracted from the amount \nof emissions that an Annex I party may emit over its commitment period. (see www.unfccc.int) \n\nCarbon Assets \n\nClasses \n\nCarbon Assets \n\nTypologies\n19\n\n  \n\nDescription \n\nAllowances Assigned Amount \n\nUnit (AAU) \n\nTotal carbon emission quantity each state/entity is \n\nallowed to emit within Kyoto Protocol \n\nAllowances European Union \n\nAllowance (EUA) \n\nUnit issued to installation under the EU ETS \n\nCredits (both \n\nprimary and \n\nsecondary) \n\nEmission \nReduction Unit \n\n(ERU) \n\n \n\nUnit of emissions reductions created through JI\n20\n\n \nprojects Units that are issued to Annex I parties. \n\nCredits (both \n\nprimary and \n\nsecondary) \n\nCertified \nEmission \n\nReduction (CER) \n\nUnit of emissions reductions created through \nCDM\n\n21\n projects \n\nCredits Removal Unit \n\n(RMU) \n\nRMUs are generated in Annex B Parties by \n\nLULUCF\n22\n\n activities that absorb carbon dioxide. \n\nAnnex B Parties can use RMUs to help meet their \nKyoto Protocol commitments. \n\n\n\nPage 30 of 92 \n\n \n\nexample) which are allocated by a regulator, usually under a cap-and-trade regime. \n\nProject-based credits transactions focus on the purchase of emission reduction credits \n\n(CERs and ERUs) obtained from the participation and/or financing of GHG emissions \n\nreducing projects. Contrary to allowances trading, a project-based transaction can occur \n\neven outside a regulatory framework, where an agreement between a buyer and a seller \n\nis sufficient.  \n\nTo comply with Kyoto Protocol, governments in most of the EU countries and Japan \n\nhave CER/ERU purchase programs. According to some authors, the total governmental \n\ndemand for the first Kyoto phase has been around 707 million tons units (both CER and \n\nERU).  \n\nCarbon assets can be traded as spot financial instruments but since 2005, when carbon \n\ntrading started, an important derivatives market has developed throughout Europe, \n\nalongside the spot market. The following carbon financial products are available at \n\nregulated Exchanges: spot settlements, forward contracts, futures contracts, and option \n\ncontracts. \n\nFIGURE 8: ETS MARKET SIZE AND CHANGE OF VOLUMES \n\nIn Europe, the most traded carbon finance instruments are the AAU, which accounted \n\nfor 84,2% of all EU ETS transactions, in the first Quarter of 2009.

CO2 TRADING IN EUROPE  \n\nEven though there is room for considerable growth and consolidation yet, carbon \n\nmarket is now a fully operational commodity market characterized by a low degree of \n\nboth liquidity and transparency.  \n\nIn fact, the Exchange Handbook (EH) refers to the EU ETS as ?the world\u2018s largest \n\ncarbon  compliance market, \u2026 both in terms of volume and volatility? representing \n\nsome two-thirds of carbon market activity. The fact that both EU demand and EU ETS \n\nstructural flaws are quickly reflected in exchange traded prices confirms its dominance. \n\nThe EH goes further arguing that the collapse of EUA prices on the Exchanges listing \n\nthem, between year 2006 and year 2007, has been initiated by information that \n\nEuropean Commission had issued too many emissions permits in Phase I of the EU \n\nETS. Also, the announcement by the European Commission of its intention to curtail \n\nthe use of CERs in Phase Three (beginning in 2012) had an almost immediate \n\ndepressive effect both on prices and on exchange activity. We agree with EH analysts \n\n\n\nPage 32 of 92 \n\n \n\nwhen they say that these are indications of healthy market functioning but, at the same \n\ntime, a manifestation of poor market regulation. \n\nThe European GHG emission allowances market has been created by a regulatory \n\nsystem, universally accepted by market actors. It presents the following characteristics: \n\n? Asymmetric information access among market players. Due to fact that some \n\nbig companies submitted to Kyoto protocol and some funds involved in \n\nquota/credit trading are at same time investors and clients, they get more \n\ninformation about current market status than their peers; \n\n? The EUA system is a dealer market. The European Carbon Exchanges provide \n\nliquidity to investors by trading shares for themselves and publicizing prices \n\neven if no trade exists. For a significant number of trading days during 2008 \n\nand 2009, the EUA exchanged volumes of contracts were very small or even \n\nzero and the prices were set through the auction trading system. During this \n\nperiod CO2 prices showed evidence of high variability and big discontinuities \n\nin offer/demand equilibrium. \n\n? EUAs being perceived more as a financial liability than as having intrinsic \n\nvalue or as being able of generating real economic added value; \n\n? High impact of regulatory announcements (f.i. may 2006); \n\n? The liberty of negotiating where ever one wants to. The legal framework of the \n\nEU ETS does not regulate how and where the trading of carbon assets takes \n\nplace and installations engaged in carbon control schemes may negotiate OTC \n\ncontracts and trade assets directly with each other, or use the organized markets \n\nto buy and sell their assets via a broker, a bank or other market intermediary.  \n\nThe EU ETS dominates the world global carbon market with spot, futures, and option \n\ntrades in market valuing \u20ac37 billion (US$50 billion) in 2007, with future contracts \n\naccounting for the major part of this value.  \n\nA - Carbon Finance Contract Types \n\nCarbon contracts can be defined as transactions whereby one party pays another party in \n\nexchange for a given quantity of GHG emission credits (or allowances), to be used by \n\n\n\nPage 33 of 92 \n\n \n\nthe buyer to meet its climate mitigation objectives. Being highly sensitive to regulation, \n\ndesign parameters and rules, ETS are heavily dependent on government policy settings. \n\nSpot Contracts offer immediate delivery, between 24 and 48 hours after transaction \n\nhave taken place. Typically, as in the European Energy Exchange, the minimum size of \n\nthe contract is 1000 tons of CO2e, even though other exchanges allow for lower \n\nminimum amounts. Price tick size is 0.01\u20ac/t.  \n\nWithin a carbon futures contract, at the time of the settlement the buyer and seller \n\nagree on the delivery and/or payment of a certain quantity of allowances at a certain \n\npoint of time in the future and at the price agreed upon. This contract gives the holder \n\nthe right and the obligation to buy or sell a certain amount of CO2 allowances, at a pre-\n\nsettled date in the future and at a predefined price. Carbon future contracts are written \n\nover EUAs or CERs and are fully standardized. Its expiry dates are the last trading day \n\nof December, from 2009 to 2012 for EUAs Futures and from 2009 to 2014 for CERs \n\nFutures. Usually the delivery is physical. Both parties of a futures contract must \n\nexercise the contract (buy or sell) on the settlement date. ECX is by far the most liquid \n\nmarket in the carbon Futures segment, accounting for almost 98% of all the market. \n\nIn the case of the European Carbon Futures the buyer and seller agree at the time of the \n\nconclusion of the transaction that EU emission allowances of a certain quantity will be \n\ndelivered and/ or paid at the price agreed on at a certain point of time in the future. \n\nForward contracts are also available, where the maturity and the underlying amount \n\nare not standardized but negotiated between counterparties. Amounts and tick \n\nspecifications are similar to spot contracts.  \n\nOptions are contracts whereby one party (the holder or buyer) has the right, but not the \n\nobligation, to exercise the contract on a future date (the exercise date or expiry date). \n\nThe other party (the writer or seller) has the obligation to respect the contract. Since the \n\noption gives the buyer a right and the seller an obligation, the buyer pays the option \n\npremium regardless of exercising it or not exercising it. The ECX exchange offers \n\nEuropean-style options with underlying EUA and CER Futures. Its expiry date is three \n\ntrading days before the expiration of the underling Future contract. According to Brett \n\nGenus and Aidan Freebairn from Evolution Markets, the year2009 was the first full year \n\n\n\nPage 34 of 92 \n\n \n\nof European carbon options trading. They refer that EUA options volumes on the \n\nEuropean Climate Exchange (ECX) experienced 71 per cent growth on a year-on-year \n\nbasis, with 415.5 million tones traded, and that CER options which trade began on ECX \n\nonly in May 2008, showed 34% growth with 91.1 million traded in 2009 against 67.8 \n\nmillion in 2008. \n\nWith markets becoming more mature, more sophisticated products are expected to be \n\nintroduced in the market. Specifically it will be possible to trade Spreads on EUAs and \n\nCERs, by buying or selling the implied price difference between EUA and CER (both \n\nfor spot and futures contracts), and Strips, by buying or selling simultaneously Futures \n\ncontracts from all available maturities (www.bluenext.fr). In this thesis we will only \n\nfocus, though, on carbon future and spot assets, not on options, or on any other carbon \n\nderivatives. \n\n2.2.5. EU ETS Price Mechanics \n\nBeing an externality, carbon costs could be forced to be incorporated directly, through \n\nthe definition of GHG taxes, or indirectly, through definition of emission caps leading \n\nto the development of a CO2 emissions market. Either way, policy makers should be \n\nable to minimize environmental impacts and costs and markets should respond to new \n\ninformation.  \n\nEurope has chosen regulation instead of taxing and created the EU ETS carbon market. \n\nBecause of carbon caps imposed on them by legislation countries, companies and other \n\nemitting entities gave rise to the carbon market when they sought to meet their GHG \n\ncommitments through the buying and selling of emission allowances and emission \n\nreduction credits. So, for policy to be effective in influencing investment decisions in \n\ncleaner technologies factors like carbon price signals, system credibility, market \n\npredictability and flexibility are of crucial importance. So far, the results are promising. \n\nIn fact, a 2005 survey\n24\n\n indicates that half of all companies in Europe\u2018s energy-intensive \n\n                                                \n\n24 \nReview of EU Emissions Trading Scheme, conducted by McKinsey on behalf of the EU Commission, was published in November \n\n2005. Its findings reflect responses from 167 companies and 163 other institutions.  \n\nhttp://www.bluenext.fr/\n\n\nPage 35 of 92 \n\n \n\nindustry regarded already the EU ETS as one of the primary factors affecting their long-\n\nterm investment decisions and profitability outlook.  \n\nIn spite of being an artificial market created by regulators, the dynamics of carbon \n\nprices have been increasingly driven by market fundamentals, as in other commodities \n\nmarkets. Currently, economic activity, oil, natural gas and coal prices, changes in \n\npolitical frameworks as well as uncertainty and expectations regarding the achievement \n\nof Kyoto targets are - among others - the main components influencing the market price \n\nof carbon.  \n\nHereafter we recall the basics of some economics rationales, presenting them in the \n\nperspective of the CO2 market: the marginal cost of abatement, the supply and demand \n\nprice mechanics and the emissions shortfall factor (as well as other carbon impacting \n\nfactors, like institutional aspects, economic growth, energy consumption and weather \n\nconditions).  \n\n2.2.5.1. THE MARGINAL COST OF ABATEMENT \n\nThe economics reasoning behind any product profitability states that, in a competitive \n\nmarket, its price must be equal to its marginal cost. Similarly, in theory, carbon price \n\nshould be equal to its marginal abatement cost. In fact, a polluter company will abate \n\nemissions if the carbon marginal abatement cost (CMAC) is smaller than current EUA \n\nprice and will buy emission permits if the CMAC is above EUA spot quotation. Thus, \n\neach one must know each own CO2 abatement cost curve or, at least, a typical, average \n\none. \n\nWithin a dynamic equilibrium model, Rubin (1996) and Baker and al. (2009) argue that \n\nthere is a typical abatement cost curve, that the CMAC is equal for every company \n\nwithin the same trading scheme and, finally, that the discounted CMAC is invariable \n\nover time, for a given quantity of emissions (see Figure 10 below).  \n\nUsually, on the left-hand side of the dashed line in Figure 10 we find the cheapest \n\nemissions, those to be reduced through optimization of output process; between the two \n\ndashed lines, namely in the steeper part of the curve, we must use technical \n\n\n\nPage 36 of 92 \n\n \n\ninstruments\n25\n\n to reduce GHG; finally, in the third part of the curve, it is too costly to \n\nimprove carbon efficiency further through technical improvements and it is more \n\nsensible to buy allowances.  \n\n \nFigure 10: The cost of different abatement instruments - the abatement cost curve \n\nSource: Partially adapted from Tillmann (2009), Figure 3.2. \n\nHowever, some authors claim, the process of finding its own marginal costs is polluted \n\nwith too much difficulties and there are some problems we have to consider when \n\ntaking decisions upon abatement costs. Similar to carbon allowances demand, marginal \n\ncosts are dependent of economic conditions, weather, fuel prices, aids, political \n\nframework and many other factors which companies cannot control all the time.  \n\nSo, starting from there, the characteristic marginal abatement curve is determined by \n\neach own cost structures and technical opportunities leading to emissions abatement, \n\nalong with the possibility of using Kyoto flexible mechanisms (Emissions Trading, \n\nJoint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism). The most important \n\n                                                \n\n25\n See second \u00a7 hereafter. \n\n\n\nPage 37 of 92 \n\n \n\ntechnical instruments one can use include fuel switch, energy efficiency improvement, \n\nheat and power co-generation, renewable or technological change (TC)\n26\n\n.  \n\n2.2.5.2. CO2 ALLOWANCES SUPPLY AND DEMAND MECHANISMS \n\nLike other commodity markets, the EUA price is mainly driven by the equilibrium \n\nbetween supply and demand and influenced by other factors related to market structure \n\nand institutional policies. \n\nHowever, EUA is a non-standard commodity which exhibits some specific features. For \n\ninstance, polluting production entities do not need to physically hold the actual permits \n\nto perform their objectives. They just have to match the allowances they have been \n\ngiven (or they have acquired) with the verified emissions they have produced, reporting \n\nthem on their yearly compliance report to the European Commission. \n\nA. Market Supply of EUAs \n\nCarbon allowances supply is politically fixed, first by European Commission and then \n\nby each Member State government through National Allocation Plans (NAPs).  \n\nDuring the first Kyoto period market offer (the carbon allowances supply side) was \n\nquite limited, since no carbon credits other than Phase I EU allowances could be used \n\nfor compliance: neither the use of Kyoto credits nor Phase II EUAs \u2013 through \n\nborrowing \u2013 were allowed. Also, in Phase I polluting entities have been given all the \n\nallowances they need, based on their GHG emitting historic profile. Thus, the number \n\n                                                \n\n26\n Addressed in several research papers, TC is considered to be a very interesting way to change the structure of the abatement cost \n\ncurve and to reduce CO2 emissions. It is understood as ?the increase in output resulting from the creative use of the same level of \ninputs, through the process of invention, innovation, and diffusion\" (free adaptation from Tillmann (2009); page 13.  \n\nTrying to understand how TC affects the structure of the Abatement Cost Curve, in his paper ?Valuation and Hedging of Carbon -\n\nDerivatives? Mathias Tillmann warns that ?in spite of all the assumptions that we can take about the reducing impact of TC all over \nthe CMAC curve, there can be increasing CMAC with TC at high levels of abatement?.  \n\nElaborating a little more on that, Tillmann reminds us Baker\u2018s research (2008) which states that at very high levels of abate ment \n\ncosts the new, more efficient, technology will be substituted away (because of its extremely high costs). So he concludes, we must \n\ntry to understand which type of marginal costs we are dealing with, especially when marginal benefits to be obtained from \n\nabatement are uncertain. It may be critical to ensure that new technologies make it possible to abate emissions, even at higher levels \n\nof abatement (for instance, using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies) and to know the CMAC associated with each  type \n\nof technology in order to select the best abatement alternative, with a clear view of its real impact on cost . For in -depth analysis on \n\nthe impact of Technological Change on abatement costs and on CMAC, refer to Mathias Tillman and Baker work papers (2008). \n\nBecause of its importance for policy makers, who have to determine the cap value for the years ahead, TC has been object of many \nother research and different approaches have been proposed in order to represent it. \n\n\n\nPage 38 of 92 \n\n \n\nof allowances available on the market was strictly equal to the number of allowances \n\ninitially allocated by regulators to installations and to new entrants\n27\n\n and matched the \n\namount just needed by polluting entities. There was no need for trading them. \n\nIn Kyoto Phase II, the flexible mechanisms and the emission shortfall factor were \n\nintroduced into the system, allowing for the ?production? of CER. It also emerged some \n\ncompanies who didn\u2018t need all the allowances they have got. Since there were some \n\nother who needed more than they have got, companies start trading between each other. \n\nAfter some time, institutional investors came into play and allowances trading became \n\nincreasingly sophisticated. \n\nIt is expected that, from 2013 onwards, a distinction will be made between industries \n\nfacing competition outside the EU\n28\n\n and other companies, like electricity producers, \n\nwhich have the ability to pass-on the increased costs of carbon certificates. \n\nProgressively, auctioning will become the basic principle and will be the rule rather \n\nthan the exception. No allowances will be allocated free of charge for electricity \n\nproduction (where, across most of the EU, will be 100% auctioning to the power \n\nsector), with very limited and temporary options to derogate from this rule. Sectors and \n\nsub-sectors found to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage will receive \n\nallowances for free, based on ambitious benchmarks, but for non exposed industries it \n\nwill be phased out. These rules imply that a much larger (estimated at more than half the \n\ntotal number of allowances in 2013) and increasing share of allowances will be \n\nauctioned.  \n\nB. Market Demand of EUAs \n\nCarbon allowances demand is a function of expected CO2 emissions, defined caps and \n\n?market sentiment?. In the long run, the demand for carbon allowances can also be \n\naffected by economic growth and marginal abatement costs. \n\n                                                \n\n27\n During Phase I none of other equilibrium factors that could affect market price, such as banking and borrowing provisions or the \n\ninflow of project credits and other flexibility mechanisms, were allowed.  \n\n28\n in order to eliminate the competitive disadvantage European players are said to have because most of their competitors outside the \n\nEU not being subject to mandatory CO2 control schemes \n\n\n\nPage 39 of 92 \n\n \n\nLike other commodities, one of the factors influencing EUA demand that is most \n\ndifficult to capture is ?market sentiment?. This expression refers to factors such as \n\nuncertainty about future energy prices and policy decisions, which are especially \n\nimportant for investors\u2018 expectations and the building of their own risk and defense \n\nstrategies. \n\nThe level of expected emissions depends on a large number of factors, both short run \n\nand long run, like energy prices (which are influenced by weather conditions), \n\nconsumption levels, industrial production, economic growth and technology used.  \n\nLong-term marginal abatement costs are determined by investment decisions in low \n\ncarbon-intensive technologies and in energy saving measures. Since investment costs \n\nare high and the future of the ETSs still present some uncertainties, on the overall firms \n\nstill choose to face mainly short term abatement costs, when deciding on their \n\nallowance demand level. \n\n \nFIGURE 11: EMISSIONS TRADING MOST EFFICIENT POINT \n\nSource: Partially adapted from Sartor (2008), Figures 1 and 2. \n\nUnder the standard assumption of rising marginal costs and in order to respect the \n\ncarbon emissions cap it has been given a profit maximizing firm will decide to abate all \n\nthose emissions for which the marginal abatement cost falls below the market price of \n\n\n\nPage 40 of 92 \n\n \n\ncarbon permits (through technological change or using any of the referred technical \n\ninstruments). Considering the economic rationality of people and firms\u2018 decisions, it is \n\nexpected that only those emissions that are cheaper to abate than the corresponding \n\npermit\u2018s price will be abated. On the other hand, firms will buy allowances on the \n\nmarket for all those emissions that would be more expensive to abate than the price to \n\nbe paid to continue to emit them. \n\nThis result is presented graphically in Figure 11 above where only the cheapest \n\nabatement alternatives have been carried out in moving from Q1 to Q* and where CO2 \n\nallowances have to be bought to move further from Q* to Q**, to respect regulator\u2018s \n\npollution limits. \n\nBy doing so, the social optimal level of emissions (the point where Marginal Social \n\nCost is equal to Marginal Social Benefit) and the cap limit is attained with the least \n\npossible cost. \n\n2.2.5.3. CO2 MARGINAL DAMAGE FUNCTION, CO2 MARGINAL BENEFIT FUNCTION AND \n\nCO2 PRICE \n\nBecause carbon emissions are a market externality, in the absence of regulation they are \n\ncostless from the perspective of polluters. However, pollution imposes damages on \n\nsociety and, like any other negative market externality, causes an increasing damage to \n\nsociety as the quantity polluted increases. As a result, we can draw a marginal damage \n\nupward function showing that the higher the pollution the higher the cost to society, per \n\neach new pollution unit produced (see Figure 12). At the same time, because it takes \n\ncompanies\u2018 resources to reduce their emissions, it is more costly to abate all emissions \n\nthan only a small portion of them and marginal costs of abatement rise with the total \n\namount of abatement to be done, we can also represent the marginal abatement cost \n\nfunction (CMAC) on an equivalent upward sloping function.  \n\nOn the other hand we know that:  \n\n? the lower the price of carbon allowances/permits, the higher the quantity \n\npolluters are willing to buy (using them instead of reducing emissions);  \n\n? the lower the emissions the higher the benefit for society (that is the benefit \n\nsociety can get from pollution is a downward sloping demand function).  \n\n\n\nPage 41 of 92 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 12: The welfare loss to society from the absence of control on emissions of a pollutant \n\nSource: Partially adapted from Sartor (2008), Figures 1 and 2. \n\nSo, a normal downward sloping curve describing the demand for emission permits and \n\nthe marginal benefit society get from pollution can also be drawn as being the same \n\ncurve.  \n\nConsidering this assumptions, at first and if we disregard the damages pollution imposes \n\non society, the total pollution the economy would produce would be the entire amount \n\nunder the demand curve and the quantity emitted would be Q1, that is, all the emissions \n\nthe economy need to make with no restriction. Nevertheless, at this pollution level the \n\nmarginal cost to society from emitting, measured by the marginal damage function, \n\nwould be greater than the marginal benefit, as measured by the demand curve for \n\nallowances. We find the net welfare loss for society resulting from this externality by \n\ncomputing the excess of cost over benefit, for each unit emitted over the point Q*, \n\nwhere the marginal benefit of polluting is equal to its marginal cost. Therefore, there \n\nwould be a net welfare loss to society from emitting Q1 and it would have an incentive \n\nto emit less, either by producing (polluting) less or by abating/mitigating the pollution it \n\nmakes. In this case, those who want to emit more either will invest on CDM projects to \n\ngenerate CER or go to the market and buy to those who emit less and still have permits \n\nto sell. The resulting equilibrium carbon price will be P*;Q*  in Figure 12. \n\nP*\n\n0 Emissions /\n\nAbatement\n\nQ*\n\nNet Loss to Society\n\nQ1\n\nMarginal Cost to Society / Emissions \nMarginal Damage Function\n\nE\nu\n\nro\ns \n\n/ \nD\n\no\nll\n\na\nrs\n\nDemand for Emission Permits / \nSocial Benefit from Pollution \n\n\n\nPage 42 of 92 \n\n \n\n2.2.5.4. THE RATIONALES BEHIND CARBON EMISSIONS CAP  \n\nEmissions trading systems propose a policy tool to help society limit pollution to \n\n?efficient\u2018 levels, incorporating all polluting costs and starting by stopping those \n\npolluters for whom it is cheaper to abate. The process begins with an environmental \n\nregulator deciding on a socially optimal level of pollution allowable for that market: \n\nQ** in Figure 13 below. To enforce that social optimum, the regulator issues permits up \n\nto the quantity of Q** (SCAP, offer level of polluting allowances) and then legally \n\nrequires each polluter to hold a permit for each unit of pollution they wish to emit. \n\nNow, provided that the market regulator can effectively enforce the new law, firms, in \n\nthe aggregate, will be allowed to emit the socially optimal level of emissions Q** only. \n\n  \nFIGURE 13: THE EMISSIONS SHORTFALL FACTOR \n\nSource: Partially adapted from Sartor (2008), Figures 1 and 2. \n\nFurthermore, by making pollution permits scarce through the setting of a cap on the \n\ntotal level of emissions, the regulator forces its value to increase from P* to P** (this \n\ncap limit is represented by the supply curve labeled ?Scap? in Figure 13). As a \n\nconsequence of the cap imposed on emissions (Scap) the supply of emissions is forced to \n\nshift to a lower aggregate quantity \u2013 from quantity Q* to the new compulsory quantity \n\nQ**. Consequently, from basic supply and demand theory, allowances will have a new \n\nequilibrium value in the market (marked ?P**; Q**? in Figure 13). \n\n\n\nPage 43 of 92 \n\n \n\nIf carbon allowances have a positive market value and are trading freely on the market, \n\nprofit maximizing companies which make pollution face an economic choice: for each \n\nextra unit of pollution made beyond their allocated cap by their activity, they have to \n\nchoose either: 1) to pay the cost of abating the additional unit of emissions (e.g. through \n\ninvestment in a new production technology or simply choosing not to produce the extra \n\nunit); or 2) to sacrifice the cost of buying an allowance, conceding them the right to \n\nemit the additional unit of pollution and carry on their normal activity.  \n\nOn the other hand, if that profit maximizing firm got from the regulator more emissions \n\npermits than it needs, it can sell the excess it got to firms needing to pollute more.  \n\nThe difference between verified emissions and allocated allowances within a given \n\ncompliance period is termed the emissions shortfall factor and it depends on the \n\nemissions abatements required by governments through the cap, which can be estimated \n\nupon released data. It is one important factor, critical to carbon price determination. \n\n2.2.5.5. THE IMPACT OF OTHER FACTORS \n\n? The Impact of Institutional Factors \n\nIt is easy to understand that, within EU ETS, institutional decisions about the strictness \n\nof the cap are decisive to initial carbon price formation within a Kyoto Trading Period. \n\nBesides, any decision or announcement from regulators (Member States governments or \n\nthe EC itself) can easily induce changes in market players\u2018 behaviour.  \n\nDuring K.P. Phase I, official communications by the European Commission were \n\nessential to reach a better information flow on installations' net short/long positions\n29\n\n \n\nand the disclosure of compliance results keeps being seen as the cornerstone of changes \n\nin market participants\u2018 expectation and strategies. In April 2006, for instance, when \n\nMember States and the European Commission disclosed the 2005 verified emissions for \n\nall EU ETS installations, the positive gap between initial allocation to industrials and \n\n                                                \n\n29\n An installation is defined as short (long) when it records a deficit (surplus) of allowances allocated with reference to its actual \n\nemissions level. \n\n\n\nPage 44 of 92 \n\n \n\nbusiness-as-usual emission forecasts caused a sharp fall in carbon prices of all \n\nmaturities (more than 50% in four days)\n30\n\n. \n\nPolitical choices can also impact the functioning of the market: in October 2006, \n\nannouncements by the European Commission to validate more strictly NAPs during \n\nPhase II reinforced the general feeling that the market could be short during 2008-2012. \n\nFrom this date on, Phase II prices increased and stabilized over 20\u20ac/ton of Carbon \n\nDioxide\n31\n\n. In this sense, Alberola (2008) identifies two structural endogenous breaks in \n\nthe time-series of spot prices during 2005-2007: the first compliance period break goes \n\nfrom April 24, 2006 to June 12, 2006; and, due to the EU Commission stricter Phase II \n\nvalidation, the second break occurred from October 26, 2006 onwards\n31\n\n. \n\n? The Impact of Energy Prices \n\nCO2 emissions are directly linked to the use of fossil fuels (such as oil, gas and coal), at \n\nleast in Europe. In turn, demand for fossil fuels depends only on their absolute and \n\nrelative prices.  \n\nDuring Phase I, short term abatement decisions, and thus the demand for allowances, \n\nwere mainly driven by unexpected fluctuations in energy demand, energy prices and \n\nweather conditions. Power and heat operators are major actors on the EU ETS\n32\n\n and, so, \n\nunexpected fluctuations on energy demand for power and heat generation and the \n\nmarginal costs of fuel switching, from high carbon intensive energy sources to low \n\ncarbon-intensive sources, still be the most important determinants of carbon allowances \n\ndemand and carbon abatement measures implementation, in the short run.  \n\nMany studies conducted on the subject [Mansanet-Bataller (2007), Delarue and \n\nD\u2018haeseleer (2007), Alberola (2008), Bunn and Fezzi (2008), Ellerman and Feilhauer \n\n(2008) ] concluded that, in fact, energy prices are the most important short term drivers \n\n                                                \n\n30\n See Figure 2, Figure 15, Figure 16 and Figure 17. \n\n31\n By mid 2006 Phase I spot prices started its way downwards towards zero until the end of Phase I due to banking restrictions \n\nimplemented between 2007 and 2008 [Alberola and Chevallier (2009)]. See Figure 4 in page 16, title 2.1.4.1. \n\n32\n The main sector whose share was the largest in terms of emissions covered by the EU ETS in Phase I was the power sector, which \n\naccounted for over 50% of emissions capped by the scheme. Their emissions abatement costs were (and still are) assumed to be the \nlowest compared to others sectors, notably through fuel switching from coal to gas. \n\n\n\nPage 45 of 92 \n\n \n\nof the demand for EUAs, due to the ability of power generators to switch between their \n\nfuel inputs. As shown by Alberola, energy prices forecast errors have basically driven \n\nEUA price changes during 2005-2007, but their influence depended also on institutional \n\nevents. Most part of analysis made, show that brent, natural gas, coal, as well as \n\nswitching prices all impact significantly carbon spot prices, their influence varying in \n\nfunction of the Kyoto sub-periods under consideration and of potential structural breaks \n\nto be detected in the time series. \n\n? The Impact of Weather Conditions  \n\nIn addition, Alberola (2008) pointed out also that CO2 prices are also affected by \n\nunexpected weather variations like temperature levels, rainfall and wind speed. Cold \n\nwinters increase the need for heating by electricity or fuels, whereas warm summers \n\nlead to higher electricity demand for cooling and lower rate of operation of nuclear \n\npower plants due to reduced cooling capacity of rivers. Rainfall, wind speeds and sun \n\nshine hours affect the share of power generated by carbon-free heat generation from \n\nhydropower, wind and solar energy. As a whole, weather conditions influence both the \n\ndemand and the offer of energy and they are widely acknowledged to play an important \n\nrole in explaining CO2 prices. \n\nAs an example, during the winter 2006, colder temperatures than the decennial average \n\nhave had the expected positive impact on EUA price changes; on the other hand, \n\ntemperatures hotter than average during the Winter 2007, have affected negatively \n\ncarbon price changes. \n\n? The Impact of Economic Activity  \n\nMany experts consider that economic activity is the most obvious driver of CO2 price \n\nchanges. It is the least understood, though. Economic growth leads to higher industrial \n\nproduction in general, to an increase in energy demand and to higher pollution \n\nemissions. This leads to higher CO2 allowances demand. The first empirical analysis \n\ndevoted to this topic may be the one conduct by Alberola in 2009. Based on a thorough \n\nanalysis of EU economic activity evolution between 2005 and 2007, Alberola attempted \n\nto extricate economic activity potential impacts on carbon price changes. His \n\neconometric analysis shows that three out of nine industrial sectors had a significant \n\n\n\nPage 46 of 92 \n\n \n\neffect on EUA price changes from July 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007. These sectors were \n\ncombustion, paper and iron which totaled 78% of allowances allocated. He have also \n\nreferred that both the variation of production and the net carbon short/long position \n\nclearly impacted CO2 price changes, as expected. He has concluded that the role played \n\nby yearly compliance positions and industrial production peaks on the new carbon \n\nmarket is significant and, based on the 2009 analysis he extended to German industrial \n\nsectors (during 2005-2007), he confirmed the role played by the power sector in EUA \n\nprice changes.  \n\n\n\nPage 47 of 92 \n\n \n\nChapter 3. Price Discovery and Price Transmission within \n\nEuropean CO2 Financial Markets - Problem Formulation, \n\nMethodology and Literature Review \n\n3.1. COMMENTS ON THE INTEREST OF THE TOPIC \n\nClimate change, global warming and all the effects of human-caused GHGs are major \n\nchallenges faced by international community, with its negative outcomes being \n\nincreasingly evident, from record temperatures to rising sea levels. In economic terms \n\nthe Stern review has warned that, in the absence of policy action, climate change would \n\nreduce world GDP by between 5% and 20%; on the other hand, Stern Review estimated \n\nas well the cost of acting to reduce GHG emissions to be around 1% of world GDP, \n\nonly. So, it would compensate to act. \n\nBased on a ?cap and trade? system Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC 1998) has been the first \n\ninternational joint-attempt to slow down and stabilize the pace of climate change. There, \n\nmost countries joint together and set targets to reduce GHG and to force a downward \n\ntrend on carbon emissions. The trading mechanism implemented by Kyoto allows most \n\nGHG abatement to occur in those sectors of the world economy in which it is cheapest \n\nto do so, making it possible to achieve the cap with the lowest possible economic \n\nimpact and in a most efficient manner. So far, and following the Kyoto Protocol \n\nsignature, several international markets for carbon permits have emerged around the \n\nworld with the EU ETS at the forefront, both in terms of market size, market maturity, \n\nand regulatory framework. In fact, the European Union Emissions Trading System is \n\nalready a success story, being considered worldwide one of the major steps towards \n\nreducing the environmental pressure humanity has put on Earth equilibrium. \n\nHowever, the introduction of the ETSs by Kyoto Protocol has also created some new \n\nchallenges to polluters, especially to polluting companies. They started being forced to \n\nmonitor and control their own carbon emissions, afterwards they were asked to manage \n\nnew systems, to develop knowledge on carbon assets, including its derivatives, and to \n\nincorporate costs of carbon allowances into their cost structures. So far, companies have \n\n\n\nPage 48 of 92 \n\n \n\nsucceeded to deal with all these new challenges, but there is too much to be learned and \n\ntoo much need for more technical research and guidance. And, as Nicolas Stern has put \n\nit, the issue of having a broadly comparable global price for carbon is one of the most \n\nimportant ones. For market participants, academics, policy makers and traders/hedgers \n\nunderstanding carbon pricing processes and carbon price behavior, as well as the links \n\nbetween carbon allowances spot price and carbon allowances futures price within the \n\nEU ETS is of vital importance. \n\nBesides, trading in CO2 is rather different from trading in more traditional commodities. \n\nFirst, in carbon market polluters (namely energy producers) hold EUA or CER \n\nprimarily to reduce the cost of adjusting their production structure over time or to avoid \n\nshortages, while in pure financial markets securities are used mainly for protection, \n\nspeculation and hedging. Second, through the cap regulators impose on them, \n\nEUA/CER sellers are forced to reduce their emissions and, most of all, are expected to \n\nsave a part of the allowances they get; if they do this they can cash them out on the \n\nmarket and sell them to someone who emits more than his allocated amount. Third, \n\ncontrary to the value of a stock which depends on profit expectations of the firms, \n\nEUA/CER price is determined mostly by balance between supply and demand of \n\npermits (Madaleno and Pinho, 2010). Fourth, contrary to ordinary stocks which \n\nliquidity may be influenced by the amount of shares to be released, the annual amount \n\nof carbon allowances given to each polluting entity or to each country is set up in an \n\nadministrative way for all trading periods in the EU-Directive. Fifth, carbon allowances \n\nhave full validity only during a trading period, meaning that the value of an allowance \n\nexpires after each commitment period. Nevertheless, for the next period break (between \n\n2012 and 2013), it is expected that unused allowances will keep being converted into \n\nallowances valid for the ensuing period (banking will be allowed), but each time-break \n\nperiod decision may be left up to each individual European member state. This means \n\nthat all excess licenses may become worthless. \n\nIllustrating this very fact, at the end of 2007, EU ETS spot price approached zero. As \n\nPinho and Madaleno (2010) point out, Parsons, Ellerman and Feihauer believed this \n\nzero value to result from the allocation mechanisms features of carbon allowances, \n\nnamely the banking and borrowing prohibition between Kyoto periods. \n\n\n\nPage 49 of 92 \n\n \n\nBecause of carbon spot value having crashing down to zero and having been taken out \n\nof markets during almost two years, questions about what should be the right price for \n\ncarbon externalities arouse. As well as questions about carbon price discovery. As \n\nMilunovich and Joyeux (2007) put it, ?the existing literature on carbon markets \n\nprovides theoretical arguments for and against carbon control  schemes. \u2026  the \n\neffectiveness of any existing carbon trading scheme will rely on the ability of the market \n\nmechanism to produce prices which accurately reflect the true marginal costs of GHG \n\nabatement. In this context, the important issue of market efficiency and price discovery \n\nin carbon derivative markets also arises.? The existence of a long-run link between \n\ncarbon spot price and its derivative price (futures price in our case) is essential and may \n\nhelp in estimating future spot price or in taking management decisions about investment \n\nin carbon emissions reduction. Milunovich and Joyeux (2007) add, ?otherwise, spot and \n\nfutures prices could diverge by assuming independent stochastic paths and the futures \n\nposition that was meant to mitigate price risk would instead result in additional risk \n\nexposure?. They conclude saying that an independent (inefficient) futures market ?has a \n\npotential to undermine the efficiency of any carbon trading scheme and we need  to \n\nuncover which market reflects new information first and leads the price discovery \n\nprocess.?  \n\nIn fact, like any other commodity market carbon allowances and its derivatives \u2013 both \n\nfutures and options \u2013 carry risk to which all operators are exposed, namely investors and \n\ntraders. Specifically, price risk arises when futures price fluctuates, forcing agents to \n\nhedge their positions through the taking of long or short positions both in the forward \n\nand in the spot markets. The existence of forward risk premia in carbon prices makes it \n\nevident that there are some carbon market agents that act because of risk considerations \n\nwhereas other are energy market agents who act in an attempt to take environmental \n\nrisks into their cost structures and into energy\u2018s prices. \n\nThat\u2018s why, companies participating in Emission Trading Schemes \u2013 both on a \n\ncompulsory and on a voluntary basis -, have to master all aspects related to the new \n\nfinancial instruments created by this new regulatory framework. Because carbon market \n\nembodies energetic, economics and finance related issues, at the same time, it is very \n\nchallenging and renders carbon price discovery and carbon price transmission between \n\n\n\nPage 50 of 92 \n\n \n\nExchanges especially complex issues and important questions to be addressed. Even \n\nthough there are already good work on the subject, so far, emission markets have not yet \n\nbeen consistently studied from a financial point of view. So, we think there still is room \n\nfor more academic work, namely on the specific subject of pricing dynamics of the \n\nEUAs, CERs and other carbon products, as well as its derivatives. That\u2018s why we \n\nchoose to address the theme of carbon price discovery in this master thesis.  \n\nReferring to price discovery Milunovich and Joyeux (2007) argue that Empirical \n\nanalyses of price discovery in general uses Granger type causality tests between spot \n\nand futures prices or volatility spillover tests. Thus if the futures price volatility  is \n\nfound to lead the spot price volatility  then the futures market is said to dominate the \n\nspot market and vice versa. Other studies develop the hypothesis of spot and futures \n\nprices being co-integrated and the subsequent decomposition of the price vector into a \n\npermanent and a transitory component (Stock and Watson 1988) assuming that the \n\npermanent component is an unobserved efficient market price. Information \n\ncontributions to efficient price discovery are then measured using, for example, \n\nHasbrouck (1995) and Gonzalo and Granger (1995) decompositions. Even though \n\nempirical evidence is not sufficiently clear, there seem to be more accounts of the \n\nfutures market dominating the spot market than the other way around, these authors \n\nconclude. \n\nUhrig-Homburg and Wagner (April, 2009) also consider that there are indications ?\u2026 \n\nthat the futures market leads the price discovery process which  is consistent with \n\nresults known from many financial and commodity markets. One reason may be the \n\nhigher liquidity in the futures market. As opposed to spot contracts, transactions with \n\nEUA futures do not have to be accounted for in the emissions registers before maturity \n\nand  companies without their own EUA allocations can only achieve short positions in \n\nthe futures and not in the spot market. Companies seeking reliable price signals in the \n\nEU ETS should therefore always start by looking at the futures market?, they conclude. \n\nAs the issue of carbon price discovery is complex and can be addresses with different \n\nperspectives and methodologies, this is not a comprehensive study. We will only try to \n\ncontribute with some more light into the subject. \n\n\n\nPage 51 of 92 \n\n \n\nThe remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: Section 3.2. presents a brief \n\nliterature survey and analyzes the relationship between spot and future prices; Section \n\n3.3. formulates the problem to be studied and presents the methodology of our analysis; \n\nSection 4.1. describes the data and its stylized statistical properties; Section 4.2. \n\nprovides the models to be used in our empirical analysis and computes them \n\n(concentrating on the relationship between carbon spot prices and carbon futures prices \n\nin the EEX through time and illustrating the concepts of risk premia and convenience \n\nyields in CO2 futures market); Section 4.3. provides our empirical findings. We \n\nconclude in Chapter 5.  \n\n3.2. PREVIOUS STUDIES AND LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nWith the maturing of CO2 market, relevant academic works taking a financial \n\nperspective of carbon trading have been published, more and more in recent years. \n\nNevertheless these academic financial analyses remain quiet sparse and concentrate \n\nmainly on EU ETS Phase I - and sometimes on its early stages -, so that an extensive \n\nand consistent analysis on the subject is still needed.  \n\nIn fact, until now the economics of the EU ETS has been the focus of most of the \n\nacademic work done, trying to evaluate whether the market is effectively leading \n\ntowards a reduction of world emissions, or if it provides the necessary flexibility and \n\ncost abatement tools for reaching Kyoto Protocol targets. [Rubin (1996), Egenhofer \n\n(2007), Kruger (2007), Veith (2008), McKinsey (2009) and Baker (2009) . \n\nBenz and Klar (2008) analyses the liquidity of the EU ETS futures market. Paolella and \n\nTaschini (2006) advocate for an econometric approach to the analysis of unconditional \n\ntail behavior and the heteroskedastic dynamics in the CO2 and SO2 allowances returns \n\nfor the US markets. They also propose a GARCH structure to model the heteroskedastic \n\n(changing volatility) dynamics of carbon returns. Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner (2006) \n\nexplore the performance and optimal design of derivatives on carbon emission \n\nallowances and Seifert, Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner (2008) built a stochastic \n\nequilibrium model for the EU ETS and analyze the resulting CO2 spot price dynamics. \n\nUsing spot and futures prices from German EEX, Daskalakis, Psychoyios and \n\n\n\nPage 52 of 92 \n\n \n\nMarkellos (2009) find evidence that market players tend to adopt standard no-arbitrage \n\npricing techniques. Benz and Tr\u00fcck (2009) put forward the use of Markov switching \n\nmodel, as well as ARCH and GARCH models for stochastic variables because of the \n\npresence of different stages in price development, price volatility and density forecasts \n\nallowing for heteroskedasticity. Daskalakis and Markellos (2009) suggest that inter-\n\nphases carbon futures can best be modeled with stochastic convenience yield models. \n\nChevallier, Ielpo and Mercier (2009) give statistical evidence that the cost-of-carry \n\nrelationship does not hold with 2008 and 2009 carbon allowances contracts prices (spot \n\nand futures); nevertheless, Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner (2007) use cointegration \n\nmethodology and found evidence of linkage between spot and futures prices using the \n\ncost-of-carry approach; using the VECM, they also find that futures markets lead carbon \n\nCER price discovery process. Contraditing the findings of Benth, Cartea and Kiesel \n\n(2008) for electricity markets, Chevallier (2010) explore the value of risk premia in \n\ncarbon allowances spot and futures prices from Bluenext and ECX and find positive \n\ntime-varying risk premia (higher for post-2012 contracts than for Phase II contracts). \n\nAlso contradicting previous researches from Bessembinder and Lemmon (2002) for the \n\nelectricity market, Chevalier find a positive relationship between risk premia and the \n\nvariance of carbon spot prices. \n\nRegarding market efficiency, Daskalakis and Markellos (2008) found inconsistent \n\nevidence about the weak form of market efficiency; they justify their findings with the \n\nimmaturity of the EU ETS and with the restrictions imposed on short-selling and on \n\nbanking. Similar findings from Milunovic and Joyeux (2007) conclude that market is \n\nefficient in the long run. In terms of price discovery, they find that the spot and futures \n\nmarkets seemed to share information efficiently and to contribute to price discovery \n\njointly. Parallel to the information diffusion pattern found in returns, they describe some \n\nevidence of bi-directional volatility transfers between the spot and various futures \n\ncontracts. \n\nSome other previous studies have focused on price discovery and on the major factors \n\nwhich might drive the EUA prices. They conclude that EUA prices appear to be drived \n\nmainly by energy prices (e.g. Bunn &amp; Fezzi 2008; Benz &amp; Klar, 2008), oil prices \n\n(Bataller, 2006), and unanticipated weather conditions (Alberola, 2008). Furthermore, \n\n\n\nPage 53 of 92 \n\n \n\ngiven that power sector is the main operator in the emission schemes, there is evidence \n\nof existing a strong linkage between electricity prices and carbon assets prices \n\n(Daskalakis &amp; Markellos, 2009). In fact, generally big spikes (both high and low) seem \n\nto be linked to oil markets, energy sector and economic cycles. \n\nLiterature on the study of the convenience yield in carbon allowances is much rare. \n\nHowever, also for the EEX market, Borak and al. (2006) examined the nature of \n\nconvenience yield for carbon allowances futures, finding that the market has changed \n\nfrom initial backwardation to contango, with major convenience yields explained \n\nmainly by price values and volatility of spot prices. Nevertheless, they have analyzed \n\nonly data of carbon spot and futures available from October 2005 to September 2006, \n\nwhich refers just to the first year of the Kyoto Protocol experimental period. \n\nGagliardi (2009) considers that carbon spot and futures prices follows the same process \n\nand are almost perfectly correlated. He goes on arguing that ?in general, forward and \n\nfutures prices differ due to marking-to-market and implied options. Since the futures on \n\nEUA do not include valuable options, such as those regarding the quality of the \n\nunderlying to be delivered, only the valuation differences due to marking-to-market \n\neffects resulting from correlations between the EUA spot prices and the risk-free \n\ninterest rates remain.? However, in another analysis Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner \n\n(2007) argue that this correlation is not evident and chose to ignore the difference. They \n\nconclude that the relationship between spot and futures prices within a trading period \n\n?should thus be explained entirely by the cost-of-carry approach?. \n\nRelevant to our present study, about price discovery is the work made by Cason &amp; \n\nGangadharan (2006), Rubin (1996), Godal &amp; Klaasen (2006) and Schleich and al. \n\n(2006), all focusing on the implications for financial markets of the EUA banking \n\nprohibition between EU ETS Phases. \n\nWe have already realized that the existing literature on carbon markets provides \n\ntheoretical arguments for and against CO2 trading schemes \u2013 e.g. Cooper (1996), \n\nKlepper (2003), McKibbin (1999) and McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2006) - but Samuelson \n\nhave already told us: ?\u2026 the effectiveness of any existing carbon trading scheme will \n\ndepend upon the ability of the market mechanisms to produce prices which can reflect \n\n\n\nPage 54 of 92 \n\n \n\nthe true marginal costs of GHG abatement?. Surely the Planet, the Kyoto Protocol and \n\nall of us will gain if we listen to our long known teacher of Economics. \n\nSo, we agree with him and, at the same time, we share the point of view of Milunovich \n\nand Joyeux (2007) when they point the issue of market efficiency and price discovery in \n\ncarbon derivative markets as one of the most important to be addressed. After their \n\nanalysis Milunovich and Joyeux conclude that, overall, it seems that the EU ETS futures \n\nmarket fulfils its roles of providing a means for effective risk management and at the \n\nsame time they contribute to the price discovery process in the spot market. However, \n\nthey also conclude that ?it appears that, comparing to mature markets, this carbon  \n\nrelatively new market exhibits a number of peculiarities (e.g. the lack of market \n\nefficiency) which participants must take into account when trading in carbon futures.? \n\nEmpirical research made by Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner (2007) show that, for futures \n\nmaturing within the Kyoto Protocol trial period, after initial divergence spot prices \n\nequal discounted futures prices. They also defend that futures contracts lead the price \n\ndiscovery process of CO2 emission allowances. Therefore, because of its price \n\ndiscovery facilitating role and because of offering means of hedging from CO2-related \n\nrisks, EUA futures are of crucial importance for all participants in the carbon emissions \n\nmarket. However, all their analysis were performed regarding early stages of Phase I \n\nand, due to market design and bankability limitations between periods, they alert that \n\ntheir conclusions may not be applicable for Phase II; so, maybe market agents are not \n\nable to learn much about fair third period futures prices, neither from the first period \n\nprices nor from the current prices of carbon futures. \n\nAs a reference, we have also reviewed some works related to risk premium on \n\nelectricity and on other energy markets. Fama and French (1988) say that it may occur \n\nviolations of the Samuelson effect when inventory is high and forward price volatilities \n\nincrease with contract maturity. Pindyck (2001) made some research on oil and on crude \n\noil futures markets finding evidence of backwardation in these markets, higher during \n\ntimes with big volatility data. Botterud and al. (2002) found equivalent results regarding \n\nthe Nordic market of electricity. Longstaff and Wang (2004) found evidence of implicit \n\nnegative excess yields and positive risk premia in futures for PJM (Pennsylvania, New \n\nJersey, Maryland) electricity markets. Wei and Zhu (2006) analyzed convenience yields \n\n\n\nPage 55 of 92 \n\n \n\nand risk premium for natural gas market. Daskalakis and Markellos (2009) concentrate \n\non the impact of CO2 EU ETS allowances on electricity risk premium and conclude that \n\nthere exists a positive relationship between emission allowance spot returns and \n\nelectricity risk premia within the EU ETS. Redl et al. (2009) also conclude in favor of \n\nthe existence of a positive forward premia in EEX and Nord Pool electricity prices from \n\n2003 to 2008.  \n\nAs opposed to some previous researchers and to public\u2018s attention \u2013 which has been \n\nmore directed towards the economics and efficiency of the trading systems \u2013 we will \n\nfocus on the financial perspective of carbon market, concentrating mainly on the \n\ncharacteristics of the EU ETS Phase II and basing our analysis on the carbon products \n\ntraded in the EEX regulated exchange. Furthermore, contrary to previous studies which \n\nhave generally focused on the EU ETS Phase I (2005-2007), this study extends the \n\nperiod of analysis to a broader time-period using data from October 2005 to October \n\n2009 and examines EEX carbon allowances price from a risk management perspective. \n\nSince it covers a complex issue that can be addressed from very different perspectives \n\nand methodologies, the present Master Thesis does not aim to be a comprehensive \n\nstudy. It attempts to analyze market efficiency and price discovery within carbon \n\nallowance markets with a double focus: ?Price Transmission and Price Discovery within \n\nCO2 Financial Markets? and the study of ?The relationship between spot and futures \n\nmarkets in the EU ETS?. \n\nOur motivation arises from the fact that carbon emission trading schemes are a \n\nrelatively new subject, mainly in its financial angle, and its markets are expected to \n\ngrow fast. Volumes are increasing at a fast pace and many investors and operators are \n\nincreasingly attracted by the opportunities created in this new and challenging market. \n\nWe believe this speed will accelerate with the economy crisis overcome. \n\n3.3. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY \n\nRegulatory, economics and some finance work on carbon market have already been \n\naddressed in some previous studies, so that we have included a short summary of the \n\nexisting literature in the previous section. Even though it is necessary to understand the \n\n\n\nPage 56 of 92 \n\n \n\nmain characteristics of the market, it is not in the scope of this thesis to address EU ETS \n\neconomical issues. We take here a purely financial perspective. \n\nSo, like Gagliardi and Sehested (May 2009) we too do not aim to analyze the \n\nconsequences of CO2 allowances allocation process - even if it impacts the price itself -, \n\nnor will we examine the economic rationales and the repercussion on market efficiency \n\nresulting from the prohibition of banking/borrowing. However, we are aware of the \n\nimportance of pinpointing some restrictions of carbon market that may impact the \n\npricing of carbon financial instruments. For example, it is important to consider that \n\nboth derivatives and its underlying assets should be continuously traded throughout the \n\nlife of the derivative contract, in order to have risk neutral pricing. This does not happen \n\nwithin CO2 market since banking and/or borrowing is prohibited between Kyoto market \n\nphases. In fact, inter-phases futures can be traded continuously, but the underlying spot \n\nproduct (the carbon allowances, AAU and EUA) from different phases cannot. These \n\nrestrictions on banking and borrowing means that emission allowances become \n\nworthless at the end of each phase and that an inter-phase derivative is essentially \n\nwritten on an asset that is not available during the whole life of its contract. According \n\nto Gagliardi and Sehested (May 2009), this restriction put a serious doubt on the \n\napplicability of the theoretical framework of the cost-of-carry pricing model for futures \n\nand the Black-Scholles framework for options (the latter is not relevant for us here, \n\nsince we will focus our analysis only on futures and spot contracts). So, relative to inter-\n\nphase assets they consider it may therefore be necessary to adopt alternative models\n33\n\n. \n\nFinally, in order to evaluate carbon price discovery process it is imperative to \n\nunderstand how pricing significant information is integrated into the market. Thus, like \n\nMilunovich and Joyeux (2007) and like Gagliardi and Sehested (May 2009), we seek: \n\n to find out which market reflects new information first and leads the price \n\ndiscovery process; \n\n to evaluate the EU ETS carbon asset\u2018s performance in sending to users price \n\nsignals that reflect relevant information about the future cost of carbon emissions.  \n\n                                                \n\n33\n For example, equilibrium models (Daskalakis, 2008) or multi-factors models (Schwartz-Smith model, for instance, refer to \n\nCarvalho paper (2010) on References Chapter of this thesis). \n\n\n\nPage 57 of 92 \n\n \n\n Which market \u2013 spot or future \u2013 leads the carbon price discovery process. \n\nWill new information show up in spot markets or in futures markets first? In other \n\nwords, which market is the center of price discovery\n34\n\n on carbon exchanges? Volume \n\ndata from different exchanges and agencies shows that EUA futures trading is much \n\nmore liquid than spot trading, even for the least liquid futures contract under scrutiny. \n\nThis is frequent in many other commodity markets and, within carbon market, could \n\nhave some specific explanations like the absence of a spot carbon asset being traded all \n\nlong the inter-phase period. So, a first guess would be in favor of the futures contract \n\nleading price discovery process.  \n\nAll this and other issues have been studied in the context of other commodities and \n\nfinancial assets but regarding carbon permits it still lacks some more in-depth empirical \n\nwork. Again, here we pretend to add with our own contribution to the discussion, \n\nfocusing on understanding the relationship between EEX carbon spot price and EEX \n\ncarbon futures spot price, namely through deep analysis of its risk premium and of its \n\nconvenience yield. \n\nThe financial products used in our analysis are EUA and CER spots and futures prices \n\nwith different maturities (Dec2006, Dec2007, Dec2008, Dec2009, Dec2010, Dec2011 \n\nand Dec2012) listed in the European Energy Exchange (EEX)\n35\n\n, from 2005 to Oct2009. \n\nThe historical prices have been obtained directly from the EEX website.  \n\n  \n\n                                                \n\n34\n Spot and futures prices are usually tested in mature markets with very high data frequency. For example, Theissen (2005) uses \n\ndata with a frequency of 15 seconds. For the immature EU ETS, only daily data are available. However, in sparsely traded markets, \n\ndifferences in price discovery between spot and futures contracts may also be observed on a daily data basis, as shown, for e xample, \nby Kavussanos/Nomikos (2003) for the freight futures market. \n\n35\n The EEX is located in Leipzig. Other important European carbon exchanges are the Bluenext based in Paris, the ECX based in \n\nLondon and the NordPool with its head offices in Oslo. Competition for market share of the global carbon market induced several \n\nannouncements about alliances between exchanges and the launch of new exchanges. Powernext\u00ae Carbon, the leading spot EUA \nmarket, was sold to NYSE Euronext in December 2007 and NYSE Euronext launched the new environmental exchange BlueNext.  \n\n\n\nPage 58 of 92 \n\n \n\nChapter 4. Price Discovery and Price Transmission within \n\nEuropean CO2 Financial Markets - Evidence from Market Data \n\nIn this analysis we use spot and futures prices of carbon allowances that trade under the \n\nEU ETS. The European Union allowances (EUA) are allocated to carbon emitting \n\ninstallations by regulator and the Certified Emissions Reductions (CER) are obtained by \n\npolluting entities through investment in CDM projects. Both are traded on the OTC \n\nmarkets and on the organized exchanges. The trading occurs between firms that over-\n\nemit and firms that under-emit relative to their allocations and among other market \n\nparticipants such as speculators, arbitrageurs and hedgers. The total number of permits \n\nissued is consistent with the path undertaken by the EU towards its overall Kyoto \n\ncommitment objective (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 8% below its 1990 level \n\nby year 2012 and reduction of 20% by year 2020). The EUA are legally binding and \n\ntargeted installations are required to surrender, in the month of April of the following \n\nyear, permits equivalents to the amount of emissions produced each year. In the case \n\nwhere an insufficient number of permits are surrendered, the organization is given a \n\npenalty\n36\n\n and still has to surrender the deficit permits. Therefore the penalty charged \n\ndoes not represent an upper limit of the price of carbon emissions; it really is a severe \n\ndiscouragement to exceed the imposed limit.  \n\nUntil now the EU ETS has evolved through two phases. Phase I (2005\u20132007) was \n\nplanned to be a pilot phase to prepare the EU for compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, \n\nincluded only about 40% of European CO2 total emissions and targeted mainly the \n\nelectricity sector. With the beginning of the second phase (2008\u20132012), the EU ETS has \n\nbroadened its coverage and incorporated other industries and other types of greenhouse \n\ngases (e.g. methane, nitrous oxide, etc). The EU ETS is expected to achieve full \n\ncompliance with the Kyoto Protocol in Phase II. Although some European member \n\ncountries have suggested that unused Phase I permits should be valid GHG offsetting \n\ninstruments in Phase II, most of them have decided that the two Phases were \n\n                                                \n\n36\n 100 Euros; refer to the end of point 2.1.4. of this thesis \n\n\n\nPage 59 of 92 \n\n \n\ninconsistent and Phase I permits should not be used in Phase II.  After 2012 the EU-ETS \n\nwill enter what is already referred to as the Post-Kyoto Period. \n\nAs argued by Daskallakis and Markellos (2008) the fact that the EU ETS is a very \n\nyoung, immature market means that significant differences in terms of stakeholders, \n\nliquidity, information and pricing may exist between spot and futures markets and \n\namong market operators. Furthermore, the pricing mechanism and the relationship \n\nbetween spot and futures allowance prices may vary considerably depending on the \n\nfutures contract that is written and on if it expires in the same phase or between different \n\nphases of the EU ETS, respectively. Given these idiosyncrasies of carbon markets, the \n\npresent study analyses spot market data along with futures market data from contracts \n\nmaturing both inter-phase and intra-phase. \n\n4.1. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS (DATA DESCRIPTION) OF THE DATA USED \n\nContrary to Daskalakis/Psychoyios/Markellos (2009), who focus only on spot and \n\nfutures markets for contracts written within the trial period, and to Uhrig-Homburg \n\n(2009), who also limit their analysis to the first period contracts, we will analyze a \n\nlarger data span, covering both the trial period and the Kyoto commitment period. \n\nTherefore, we will focus in a time-period ranging from 2005 to 2009 and will include \n\nboth Phase I and Phase II carbon assets. Data used is daily prices coming from the EEX \n\nofficial website. For carbon spot price we have divided our sample into two sub-periods \n\nin order to organize our analysis into a Phase I period (October 2005 to November \n\n2007) and a Phase II period (March 2008 to October 2009). \n\nLike any other futures contract, at the date of the transaction the buyer and the seller of \n\nEuropean Carbon Futures (ECF) traded in the European Energy Exchange (EEX)\ni\n agree \n\non the payment/delivery of a certain amount of EUA/CER, at a certain price and at a \n\ncertain point of time in the future. Each contract\u2018s party has the right or the obligation to \n\nbuy or sell a certain amount of CO2 allowances, at a pre-settled date in the future and at \n\na predefined price. Thus the delivery and/or purchase of EUA/CER form the object of \n\nECFs contracts and its price is specified in Euros per EUA or Euros per CER. \n\nSettlement prices for the respective futures contract are established after the end of \n\n\n\nPage 60 of 92 \n\n \n\ntrading, on each exchange trading day. The penultimate exchange trading day of \n\nNovember is the last day of trading for each future contract. Carbon derivative products \n\nused in our analysis are EUA and CER spots and futures prices with maturities \n\nDec2006, Dec2007, Dec2008, Dec2009, Dec2010, Dec2011 and Dec2012. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 14: HISTORIC CO2 SPOT PRICES AND CO2 FUTURES PRICES (EUA AND CER) \n\nFigure 14 above depicts the evolution of spot prices and futures contracts, both for EUA \n\ncontracts and for CER contracts, for all maturing dates considered (from 2006 to 2012). \n\nData time span is from 04 August 2005 to 01 October 2009.  \n\nAs we can see, both spot and futures carbon markets are characterized by a particularly \n\nhigh historical volatility, with some major spikes appearing here and there, showing \n\nperiods of different volatility all along the years we have got. Alberola, Chevalier and \n\nCh\u00e8ze (2008) have identified two structural breaks for the 2005-2007 period and we \n\nthink it could be interesting to test for structural breaks also within Phase II futures \n\ncontracts. We will let it for future research. \n\nIf we disregard the beginning of the Fist Period falling towards zero value, from \n\nSeptember 2006 to March 2008 (Spot value and Futures Dec2006 and Dec2007), we \n\ncan observe that EUA futures prices ranged from a minimum of 9,43\u20ac (EUA Futures \n\nDec2006; 12/05/2006) and 8,10\u20ac (EUA Futures Dec2009; 12/02/2009) to a maximum \n\nvalue of 34,72\u20ac (18/04/2006) and 33,30\u20ac (30/06/2008). The record low came with the \n\nmarket turmoil that took place in February 2009, as an effect of international sub-prime \n\n\n\nPage 61 of 92 \n\n \n\ncrisis and of decreasing energy prices. After this recent break-down, carbon prices \n\nincreased again and remained relatively stable around 15\u20ac/EUA, until the end of our \n\nsample data. On the other side, carbon maximum values are considered to be a \n\nconsequence of high oil prices which pressures electricity production through the use of \n\nfossil fuels and, thus, pressures demand for carbon assets. If we refer to CER futures we \n\nsee that prices have had minimums of 7,55\u20ac and maximums of 26,30\u20ac, with an average \n\nranging from 14,86\u20ac to 18,35\u20ac. So, we agree with Gagliardi and Sehested (May 2009) \n\nwhen they conclude that, generally, big spikes in both directions seems to be linked to \n\noil markets, to economic expectations and to the energy sector. \n\nBefore going any further and apply the econometrical analysis to our data it is necessary \n\nto perform a quick statistical analysis on the series to identify the main features of price \n\ndynamics and the characteristics of price distribution. In general terms, data main \n\nstatistics are: average prices for the period ranging from 11,24\u20ac to 21,71\u20ac (depending on \n\nthe asset being analyzed) with negative mean returns ranging from -0,025 to -1,124. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 15: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS OF SPOT PRICES AND FUTURES PRICES (LOGARITHMIC RETURNS) \n\nData explanation: ?EEX CO2 Spot Value? is the EEX spot price, ?EEX; F1PE; Dec06? \n\nand ?EEX; F1PE; Dec07? is the EEX carbon future contracts for period I with maturity \n\nin 2006 and 2007, respectively, ?EEX; F2PE; Dec08?, ?EEX; F2PE; Dec09? ?EEX; \n\nF2PE; Dec10?, ?EEX; F2PE; Dec11? and ?EEX; F2PE; Dec12? is the EEX carbon \n\nfuture contracts for period II with maturities from 2008 to 2012. ?Obs.? refers for the \n\nnumber of observations. The rest of the variables are the standard ones.  \n\nIn this table we present the descriptive statistics for logarithmic returns, meaning that \n\nwe have computed ft = log Ft - log Ft-1 and st = log St \u2013 St-1, where low case letters are \n\nreturns and F and S stand for future and spot prices, respectively. \n\nAll price series present non-zero skewness and excess kurtosis. Also, summary statistics \n\nof the data show that we have non-normal distributed returns negatively skewed and \n\nEEX CO2 Spot Val ue EEX; F1PE; Dec06 EEX; F1PE; Dec07 EEX; F2PE; Dec08 EEX; F2PE; Dec09 EEX; F2PE; Dec10 EEX; F2PE; Dec11 EEX; F2PE; Dec12\n\nObs. 547 295 547 176 390 390 390 390\n\nMean -1,125 -0,357 -1,124 -0,042 -0,038 -0,031 -0,025 -0,018\n\nVari ance 8,200 5,167 6,690 3,842 3,170 3,088 3,039 2,940\n\nSkewness 0,050 -0,404 -0,856 -0,752 -0,437 -0,486 -0,598 -0,574\n\nKurtosi s 10,426 30,829 11,798 15,220 16,451 16,465 17,283 16,380\n\n\n\nPage 62 of 92 \n\n \n\nleptokurtic. The negative skewness suggests that the distribution has a long left tail, \n\nhence generating large negative values. The value for kurtosis is very high (higher than \n\nthree) which indicates that tails decay less quickly compared to a normal distribution, \n\nimplying that the distribution has fat tails. Since we work with logarithmic returns, price \n\nstationarity would not be a problem, as the variables are stationary at their log first \n\ndifference\n37\n\n. \n\nAs we have referred to earlier in this thesis, in the literature carbon emission allowances \n\nprices are usually presented as having high historical volatility\n38\n\n. In fact historic carbon \n\nspot prices show some volatility, with a standard deviation value of 2,86%; futures price \n\npresent standard deviation values ranging from 1,74% to 2,59%, depending on which \n\nfuture contract maturity we are talking about.  \n\nBoth in Figure 15 above, in Figure 16 and in Figure 17 below we can see that volatility \n\nfor Period I futures - FutDec06 and FutDec07 - is higher than that of Period II. This is \n\nconsistent with the fact of market being very young, recent and immature, with Period I \n\nfunctioning as an experimental stage for carbon market. Carbon futures contracts from \n\n2008 to 2012 show a much lower volatility between them, may be due to market \n\nbuilding on learning from Phase I.  \n\nGoing a little bit further, if we break up data series and plot them according to Kyoto \n\nProtocol Period (plotting each Phase\u2018s trading prices separately), we can get some more \n\ndetail on information. In Figure 16 below we can see that carbon prices \u2013 both spot and \n\nfutures - tend to move together. As we have pointed out, during year 2006 prices \n\nshowed great volatility and, after having attained its highest level (around 30 Euros per \n\npermit), they started its way down towards zero. \n\nAt the beginning of year 2006 we can see the effects of growing energy consumption, \n\ncaused by an extreme cold in Europe. Together with increasing oil prices (relative to \n\n                                                \n\n37\n Results will be provided upon request. \n\n38\n Refer to Paolella and Taschini (2008) or to Daskalakis, Psychoyios and Markellos (2009) for a detailed description of the \n\nstatistical properties of EUA prices series. \n\n\n\nPage 63 of 92 \n\n \n\ncoal), this led to an increased use of electricity production power plants and to higher \n\ndemand for CO2 allowances, pulling prices up and up in the months ahead. \n\n \nFIGURE 16: PHASE I EEX CARBON PRICES (SPOT AND FUTURES) \n\nNevertheless, as argued by Daskalakis and Markellos (2008), immediately after that we \n\ncan observe a major market correction which took place during April/May 2006 and \n\nturned out to be the first negative spike of the data series. In fact, carbon price dropped \n\nabruptly from approximately 30 to 10 Euros washing away over half of the EU ETS \n\nmarket value. It is believed that this market correction has been fostered by the \n\npublication of some reports regarding 2005 actual emissions level for every installation \n\nfalling under the EU ETS directive. These reports indicated that EU member states had \n\nover-allocated EUAs to their emission intensive firms and that consequently the market \n\nwas not as short as was thought to be. For Gagliardi and Sehested (May 2009), the \n\npublication of 2006 emissions and allowances data did showed that most sectors and \n\nmember states had excess allowances comparing to their needs.  \n\nWe have already referred that banking and borrowing was prohibited between the first \n\ntwo EU ETS Kyoto periods (from 2007 to 2008) and any unused allowances by the end \n\nof year 2007 could not be used for compliance in 2008. Moreover, as Gagliardi reminds \n\nus the expected spot price for the year 2008 was influenced by factors that did not have \n\nany impact on first period\u2018s spot prices, such as the European Union final decision \n\nregarding EUA allocations for the second trading period. As a possible consequence of \n\n\n\nPage 64 of 92 \n\n \n\nthat, first period futures EUA lose value until they reach zero Euros (what we can \n\nobserve clearly in Figure 16 above). \n\nIn effect, looking at Figure14, at Figure 16 and at Figure 17 we can see a real break \n\ndown of CO2 spot price along with Phase I futures price. Even if Phase II futures price \n\nhave also felt a great impact, carbon spot price (the bold blue line) and Phase I futures \n\nstart falling apart from Phase II futures prices since Spring 2006 and, from mid \n\nSeptember, they experienced a real price crash (refer to Figure 14).  Carbon spot price \n\nreaches zero value and, since Q1 2008, it is stopped from being traded during almost \n\none year, until 16 January 2009. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 17: PHASE II EEX CARBON PRICES (SPOT AND FUTURES) \n\nBecause of that, between year 2006 and the beginning of year 2009 we can see that \n\nnone of the futures contracts exhibit a stable long-run relationship with spot price. As \n\nMilunovich and Joyeux argue (2007) this was due to the unavailability of a relevant \n\ncarbon spot price for the Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Adding to this, \n\nwe also consider that information instability and regulation uncertainties resulting from \n\nKyoto Phase change has greatly contributed to carbon spot pricing break-down and to \n\nfutures breaking apart from spot. Hence, during this inter-Period break, futures prices \n\nwere not co-integrated with carbon spot price. Many academics consider that, during \n\nthis period, futures contracts have functioned as a vehicle of price discovery for the \n\nfuture Phase II spot price. \n\n\n\nPage 65 of 92 \n\n \n\nBoth in the figure 14 and in Figure 17 we can also observe the beginning of trading of \n\nfutures on Certified Emission Reductions (CER)\n39\n\n. After some years of trading only \n\nEUA futures at EEX, futures on CER were launched, starting being traded on 26 March \n\n2008. At first, its trading price was much lower than this of EUA futures, but slowly it \n\nwent up until it approaches EUA futures prices. Nevertheless CER futures trading prices \n\ntend to be lower than those of EUA futures prices and than those of carbon spot price \n\n(we can observe the price difference with spot price after spot trading prices reappear, in \n\nJanuary 2009).  \n\n4.2. THE RISK PREMIA AND THE CONVENIENCE YIELDS IN CARBON EMISSION \n\nALLOWANCES \n\nAs Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner remind us (2009), in general the relationship between \n\nspot and futures prices depends on the fundamental market characteristics and there \n\nexists a wide variety of markets. At the one end of the spectrum we find commodities \n\nsuch as gold, which can easily be stored and function like investment assets. In cases \n\nlike this the futures price is determined by no-arbitrage circumstances. If we presuppose \n\na constant interest rate r and no storage costs or dividends, the only costs of holding the \n\nunderlying will be the predetermined interests. In this case, futures price is given by the \n\nstandard cost-of-carry econometric model. \n\nNevertheless, in many commodity markets, Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner (2009) keep \n\narguing, a significant part of the demand is determined by real needs. As a result, \n\nholding the physical security will impose costs but can result also in extra benefits for \n\nthe holder. These benefits, which add to the income of the spot commodity\u2018s holder as \n\nopposed to the holder of a futures contract, are defined as a convenience yield. Such \n\nprofits may result from the opportunity to avoid shortages in the spot commodity when \n\nrequired for incorporating into the production process. Classical examples are those of \n\nfuels like gas, coal, and oil.  \n\n                                                \n\n39\n Remember from previous Chapters that CERs are the certified emission reductions generated by polluters through their \n\nparticipations in CDM projects. See Chapter 2. \n\n\n\nPage 66 of 92 \n\n \n\nIn addition, at the other end of the market spectrum, Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner \n\n(2009) tell us, we find pure consumption goods, such as power or wheat, which are \n\neither almost non-storable or are storable only at unaffordable costs. In this case, the \n\nlink between spot prices and futures prices no long exists. \n\nAs we have explained before, EUAs are traded without restrictions within the same \n\ntrading period; the only major storage costs are the predetermined interests. So, in the \n\nabsence of stochastic interest rates, the only probable reason for up-dated carbon futures \n\nprices to be different from carbon spot prices is the existence of a latent convenience \n\nyield on the spot EUA, Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner (2009) conclude. Nevertheless, \n\nsince companies can easily borrow EUAs from next year\u2018s allocation it is not \n\nanticipated a major convenience yield for futures maturing after the subsequent \n\ncompliance date but still be within the same trading period. \n\nFinance theory tells us that, in general, forward and futures prices differ due to marking-\n\nto-market and implied choices. Since futures on EUAs do not include valuable choices, \n\nsuch as those vis-\u00e0-vis the quality of the underlying asset to be delivered, Uhrig-\n\nHomburg and Wagner (2009) consider that it only remains the valuation differential due \n\nto marking-to-market effects coming from differences between the EUA spot prices and \n\nthe risk-free interest rates; they carry and argue that the relationship between spot and \n\nfutures prices within a trading period should therefore be fully explained by the cost-of-\n\ncarry model. Since first period spot certificate could not be transferred to the second \n\ntrading period they viewed the transition period between 2007 and 2008 to a different \n\nsituation, considering a future 2008, for example, to be comparable to the situation \n\ndescribed previously for power and wheat. With the cash-of-carry arbitrage not being \n\npossible and the first period spot certificate not suitable for the second trading period, \n\nspot price for the year 2008 was expected to be influenced by factors not having any \n\nimpact on first period\u2018s spot prices (such as EC final decision regarding EUA \n\nallocations for Phase II). As such, Uhrig-Homburg and Wagner (2009) expect the cost-\n\nof-carry or constant convenience yield model not to hold in such a situation. \n\nFinancial literature early models \u2013 namely the cost-of-carry model - generally state that \n\nin equilibrium discounted forward prices must equal current spot prices. So, implied \n\nyields from spot and futures prices should equal riskless interest rates within the same \n\n\n\nPage 67 of 92 \n\n \n\ntrading period. Even if we accept that there may be temporary disequilibrium due to the \n\nimmaturity of the market, in the long-term, discounted futures prices and spot prices \n\nshould be co-integrated. Like Pinho and Madaleno (2010) refer, this no-arbitrage \n\nreasoning is based on a buy-and-hold strategy which functions well in typical financial \n\nand commodity markets, but doesn\u2018t function in non-tradable commodities markets, like \n\nelectricity and carbon.  \n\nGagliardi and Sehested (2009) remind us that the Futures market is usually described as \n\nhaving four possible conditions. The market may exhibit backwardation, when futures \n\nprice Ft,T (price in time t, with maturity or delivery in T with T > t) is less or equal the \n\ncurrent spot price ST . It is described as normal backwardation if Ft,T is less or equal to \n\nthe expected value for spot price in T, that is E(ST). On the other hand, contango usually \n\nrefers to a situation where futures price is higher than the spot price, and normal \n\ncontango similarly denotes the market condition in which Ft,T  E(ST).   \n\nIn fact, for every moment t in time, carbon allowances futures price Ft,T with delivery in \n\nT can be greater than current spot price at time t, St and greater than the expected spot \n\nprice at delivery time T, Et(ST). In this case the market is said to be in contango (more, \n\nin normal contango). When futures price Ft,T is less or equal than current spot price St \n\nand less than expected value of spot price at delivery time T, Et(ST), futures market is \n\nsaid to exhibit backwardation (and normal backwardation). Normal backwardation is \n\nequivalent to a positive risk premium, since the risk is transferred to the long position\n40\n\n \n\nin futures contract. Figure 18 below summarizes these four possible states of the futures \n\nmarket. \n\nFutures Market Possible States \n\nBackwardation Ft,T  ST \n\nNormal Backwardation Ft,T  E(ST) \n\nContango Ft,T  ST \n\nNormal Contango Ft,T  E(ST) \nFIGURE 18: FUTURES MARKETS ALTERNATIVE SITUATIONS \n\n                                                \n\n40\n The buyer of a futures contract is said to have a long position, while the seller assume a short position.  \n\n\n\nPage 68 of 92 \n\n \n\nThere is no clear consensus about the reasons which drive the market towards one of the \n\nabove conditions, nor on the actual situation of the market. In the opinion of Gagliardi \n\nand Sehested (2009) market appears to be in contango when operators believe the \n\ndemand will rise and when the market is not in over-allocation as it has been in Phase I \n\nof the EU ETS. Otherwise it will be in backwardation. \n\nPrevious research\n41\n\n results point out that price volatility influences negatively both the \n\nconvenience yield and risk premia, while spot price influences positively the \n\nconvenience yield value. More, there are signs that there exist a relationship between \n\nrisk premium and the convenience yield, but there persists some uncertainty about its \n\nsign and, also, the level of its statistical significance. Results change depending on the \n\nKyoto Phase under analysis and on the futures contract maturities. Nevertheless, we can \n\nconclude that carbon market has been in contango most of the time.  \n\nAccording to the theory of storage, in addition to interest foregone through the \n\ncommodity, storage costs for holding the commodity and a convenience yield on \n\ninventory has to be considered. This reasoning is integrated in the following expression: \n\n Ft,T = Ste\n(r+sc- )(T-t) \n\n      (1) \n\nwhere Ft,T is the futures price at time t for a contract with delivery in time T; \n\nSt is the asset spot price at time t; \n\nr is a constant interest rate\n42\n\n;  \n\nsc stands for storage costs, and \n\n is the convenience yield and represents the benefit obtained by holding the \n\nphysical asset, using or applying it.  \n\nSo, the convenience yield is the incremental value of spot prices over futures prices \n\nafter accounting for carrying costs. According to this theory, arbitrageurs would be able \n\nto make risk-free profits if futures price deviates from this relationship.  \n\n                                                \n\n41\n Some authors that have studied CO2 price dynamics are: Madaleno/Pinho (2010), Uhrig-Homburg/Wagner (2009), Daskalakis/ \n\nPsychoyios/Markellos (2009), Benz/Tr\u00fcck (2008), Paolella/Taschini (2008), Seifert/Uhrig-Homburg/Wagner (2008), Fehr/Hinz \n\n(2006), Borak et al. (2006), among others. \n\n42\n In the estimations we performed we have assumed a constant interest rate of 4%. Sensitivity analysis performed with this interest \n\nrate revealed that the main conclusions remained the same. \n\n\n\nPage 69 of 92 \n\n \n\nAn easily understandable way to think of the cost-of-carry model is to think of it as \n\ncomparing the futures and spot prices of a product by adjusting the spot price for the \n\nadvantages to holding it rather than the long futures position (that is, the right to buy the \n\nspot product at time T) and the disadvantages of holding it versus the long futures \n\ncontract. The cost-of-carry model is also referred to as the no-arbitrage pricing model \n\nbecause it implies that, under a set of conditions that are approximated by modern \n\nfinancial markets, market participants can make risk free profits if they buy the \n\nunderpriced good and sell the overpriced good.  \n\nDespite some market distortions in the real world \u2013 such a trader borrowing constraints, \n\nand transaction costs \u2013 there is considerable literature which suggests the cost-of-carry \n\nmodel frequently holds in mature and liquid financial and storable commodities markets \n\nwithin the limits of transaction costs. Nevertheless we know that, within carbon \n\nmarkets, storage costs are null. \n\nSo, we agree with Milunovich and Joyeux when they say that in an efficient market the \n\nfutures price should equal the spot price, adjusted for the opportunity cost of holding a \n\nspot position, that is, the interest foregone, less a dividend/convenience yield. The cost-\n\nof-carry model is derived from a no-arbitrage condition that operates on a risk-free \n\nportfolio. We also share the point of view of Pindyck (2001) when he says that \n\ndifferences between current spot prices and futures prices can be explained by storing \n\ncosts, ware-housing costs and a convenience yield. Considering that in carbon markets \n\nstorage costs are null\n43\n\n, if we presume no-arbitrage possibilities between spot and \n\nfutures markets, we can obtain a formula for the convenience yield. S, we can imagine \n\nthat we hold a unit of carbon emissions rights at time t, which current spot price is St. \n\nAs Borak and al. (2006) put it, if we assume the existence of a convenience yield, \n\nholding the emission rights until maturity will pay the following revenues: \n\nST-St+ (T-1)        (2) \n\n                                                \n\n43\n Carbon allowances are immaterial and carbon storage costs only exist on company\u2018s balance sheets. \n\n\n\nPage 70 of 92 \n\n \n\nwhere (T-1) is the convenience yield gained from holding the asset from time t to time \n\nT. If at the same time we right a futures short contract for delivery in T, its return will \n\nbe equal to Ft,T-ST. \n\nSo, given the no-arbitrage argument we must have: \n\nST-St+ (T-1)+Ft,T-ST = (e\nr(T-t)\n\n-1)St          \n\n        (T-1) = Ste\nr(T-t)\n\n-Ft,T      (3) \n\nwhich is the equation for the convenience yield. Given that positions are covered, the \n\ntransaction involves no risk and the total return ends-up being non-stochastic (Wei and \n\nZhu; 2006). So, the returns should be equal to those of a risk-free investment, whose \n\nreturn is rf, with price St. \n\nLike in all other markets, expectations and risk choices of carbon market operators will \n\ndecide CO2 futures prices. This approach states that futures price is composed of two \n\ncomponents, the expected future spot price and the risk premium. Thus, the very \n\nexistence of risk premia means that futures prices are not unbiased predictors of future \n\nspot prices. In this case, if we did used simple futures prices it would end up in \n\nerroneous estimates of future spot prices and in ineffective decisions of carbon market \n\nparticipants.  \n\nSimilar to all other financial markets, we can take risk premium as the reward of market \n\nparticipants for accepting to bear risk, meaning, for choosing to hold risky investments \n\ninstead of choosing to invest in risk-free assets. Since carbon allowances demand \n\nfluctuates through time depending on economic conditions, energy markets demand and \n\non weather conditions, we also expect risk premia to vary in magnitude over time, in \n\nresponse to the evolution of those markets and of the global economy. Samuelson \n\n(1965) found a typical decreasing term structure in futures price volatility as maturity \n\nincreased (the term structure of a commodity forward price volatility), which became \n\nknown as the Samuelson effect or time-to-maturity effect. \n\n\n\nPage 71 of 92 \n\n \n\nLet Et(ST) be the spot price we expect today (time t) an asset will have at time T, and \n\nFt,T the price we have to pay today for a carbon allowances future contract with maturity \n\nat time T. The risk premium (RP) is given by:  \n\nRPt = Ft,T-Et(ST)      (4) \n\nWeron (2008) tells us that many authors consider the forward premium (FP) to be the \n\nrisk premium (RP), but putting RP=-FP. Chevallier (2010) also uses the forward \n\npremium, referring to it directly as the risk premium. We agree with the latter and will \n\nuse the forward risk premium each time we want to refer to the risk premium. So, we \n\ncalculate carbon allowances risk premium at time t as the difference between traded \n\nfutures price and the ex-post delivery spot price (Chevallier; 2010), where the spot price \n\nat time T (the ex-post delivery futures price FT,T) is used as a proxy of the expected \n\nfutures price at time t with delivery in T, that is Et(FT,T): \n\nRPt = Ft,T-ST       (5) \n\nWe also compute this risk premium in carbon allowances prices for all contracts in EEX \n\nwith delivery between 2006 and 2012. We expect this risk premium to vary in \n\nmagnitude over time due to the fact that carbon allowances demand also varies through \n\ntime depending on weather and other energy markets. The way risk premium method \n\ndoes function as a good estimator for carbon futures prices suggest that futures prices \n\ncannot be used as unbiased estimators of expected future spot price. On the contrary, \n\nthey reflect the demand and supply for hedging purposes (Karakatsani and Bunn, 2005). \n\nEarlier studies on electricity market forward risk premium concluded that risk premia in \n\nelectricity markets are a negative function of time-to-maturity (Benth, Cartea and \n\nKiesel, 2008; Diko, Lawford and Limpens, 2006). In order to test if this relationship \n\nbetween time-to-maturity and forward risk premium holds also at carbon market, we \n\nestimate the following model: \n\nRPt = + Tt+  T\n2\n\nt+ t     (6) \n\nwhere:  \n\n is the constant term ; \n\n\n\nPage 72 of 92 \n\n \n\nTt = T-t stands for the remaining time-to-maturity of the underlying contract, and  \n\nt is an i.i.d. Gaussian white noise error variable with mean 0 and variance \n2\n.  \n\nTime-to-maturity is computed as the difference between the trading day t and the first \n\nday of the delivery period for the underlying contract (in calendar days). The constant \n\nterm  stands for the overall relative hedging pressure, while  and  coefficients \n\nrepresent the relationship between risk premia and time-to-maturity. \n\nTo assess the commodity price models used, we have inspected separately the empirical \n\ndetermination of the convenience yield and risk premium.  \n\nWe have already seen that the convenience yield is the gain achieved for holding the \n\ncommodity instead of holding its derivative contract. Its value depends on a number of \n\nfactors (Pindyck, 2001), such as: current price level, price volatility and storage level \n\n(for deeper explanations refer to Wei and Zhu; 2006). As previously mentioned, in \n\ncarbon allowances there is no physical storage cost for holding an emission right (Borak \n\nand al., 2006). Our empirical convenience yield can then be formalized as follows: \n\nt = 0+ 1St+ 2\n2\n\nt+ t     (7) \n\nwhere:  \n\nt is the marginal convenience yield as specified in (3);  \n\nSt is the log spot price of carbon emission allowances;  \n\n2\nt is the price volatility modeled as a GARCH (1,1)\n\n44\n.  \n\nIf theories are correct, we should expect both 1 and 2 to be positive. \n\nTo validate the theory of commodity prices we also regress the extracted risk premium \n\ncomponent on the convenience yield and price volatility. The risk premium is then \n\nmodeled as: \n\nRPt = 0+ 1\n2\n\ns,t + 2 t+ t     (8) \n\n                                                \n\n44\n We will specify the volatility forecasting measures below, but for the convenience yield regression we have just used the \n\nGARCH(1,1) specification given that results obtained were very similar using other common volatility forecasting measures. \n\n\n\nPage 73 of 92 \n\n \n\nWe choose to perform the regression in this way since Considine and Larson (2001) \n\nsuggested that risk premium is positively related to price volatility, and Schwartz (1997) \n\nsuggested that risk premium should be positively related to the convenience yield. Also, \n\nwe assume a simple variance structure for the spot for the tractability of the estimation, \n\nwhich simultaneously captures the time-varying aspect and, finally, we obtain the time \n\nvarying conditional variance from the GARCH (1,1) model. \n\nIn the following section we will present and discuss the empirical results obtained.  \n\n4.3. EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n\nAfter applying the econometric models presented above, in the following section we \n\nwill give detailed analysis results for carbon allowances risk premia and convenience \n\nyields. Prediction \n\nInitially we anticipated that carbon futures prices would predict expected CO2 future \n\nspot prices. Hereafter we present the results obtained with carbon allowances risk \n\npremium measure we have used described in equation (5) above . \n\n \nFIGURE 19: RISK PREMIA ON EEX PHASE I CARBON ASSETS \n\nIn Figure 19 above we present risk premium evolution for carbon spot prices and for \n\ncarbon futures with maturity December 2006 to December 2007 (Kyoto Protocol Phase \n\nI data). In Figure 20 below we display the evolution of risk premium for carbon spot \n\nprices and for carbon futures with maturity December 2008 to December 2012 (Kyoto \n\nProtocol Phase II data).  \n\n\n\nPage 74 of 92 \n\n \n\n \nFIGURE 20: RISK PREMIA ON EEX PHASE II CARBON ASSETS (EUA) \n\nWe also present risk premia of CER (which started being traded at EEX only at the end \n\nof March 2008) in Figure 21 below. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 21: RISK PREMIA ON EEX PHASE II CARBON ASSETS (CER) \n\nAll these three figures allow us to recognize the time varying nature of risk premium in \n\nEEX carbon allowances. Moreover, regardless of its size and maturity period, risk \n\npremia seem to vary together, even though it presents different magnitudes among \n\nfutures of different maturities (especially with respect to CER risk premia). \n\n\n\nPage 75 of 92 \n\n \n\nWe can see that Phase I contracts presented much higher risk premia and much higher \n\nrisk premia variations than those of Phase II, especially during the first quarter of year \n\n2006. Phase II contracts show higher variations of risk premia between the end of \n\nquarter two and the beginning of quarter three of year 2008. The lowest values of Phase \n\nI carbon contracts happened at the beginning of quarter two 2006 and from quarter one \n\n2007 onwards, because of exogenous factors to which we have already referred to \n\nearlier. In Phase II carbon allowances futures contracts, the minimum values were \n\nreached at beginning of first quarter 2009, maybe because of international economic \n\ncrisis, economic activity slow down and consequent lowering in pollution emissions. \n\nThis has probably contributed to the start of carbon risk premia decreasing. During \n\n2009 risk premia remained relatively stable but low (below 5\u20ac/EUA).  \n\nWe also think that differences between Phase I risk premia and Phase II risk premia \n\nmay be an indication of decreasing uncertainties around post-Kyoto negotiations, \n\nincreasing efficiency of the EU ETS, which allow for easier and faster incorporation of \n\ninformation into prices, and increasing rationality of investors, who have learned \n\nthrough time all along Phase I. In spite of all these maturing market signs, we still have \n\na long way to go in terms of energy efficiency and emissions control in electricity \n\nproduction and all other economic sectors. In fact, Germany (and EEX) seems to be \n\ngiving the first steps towards reducing GHG emissions burden and cleaner technologies \n\nare starting to be preferred to other more pollutant alternatives. \n\nThe positive sign of risk premia shows that expected future spot prices turned out to be \n\nlower than forward prices. This means that market for CO2 at EEX those days has been \n\nin normal contango\n45\n\n (except for FCER, during 2009), which disagrees with Daskalakis \n\nand Markellos results of 2009 but is in direct support of Chevallier\u2018s conclusions (2010) \n\nfor the French market. Furthermore, risk premium found for carbon allowances prices \n\nvary in magnitude across delivery periods of both Phase I and Phase II futures even \n\nthough the relative magnitude of risk premia keeps being similar all along the period \n\nanalyzed, maintaining its relative position. Regarding CER futures, we can see that \n\n                                                \n\n45\n The sign of the risk premium (positive for most of the sample period) indicates that expected spot prices are lower than the \n\nforward price, which implies that the day-ahead market for CO2 in EEX is in normal contango. Notice that we have mentioned \npreviously that we are considering RP = -FP. Refer to section 4.2. for the definition of normal contango. \n\n\n\nPage 76 of 92 \n\n \n\nFCER Dec08 had a much greater risk premium compared to all other CER futures, \n\nmaybe because of its cross-Periods characteristic.  \n\nIn Figure 22 below we present descriptive statistics for risk premia calculated through \n\nequation (5). We can see that the average risk premium is positive for all futures \n\ncontracts analyzed. \n\nRisk \nPremium \n\nEEX; F1PE; \nDec06 \n\nEEX; F1PE; \nDec07 \n\nEEX; F2PE; \nDec08 \n\nEEX; F2PE; \nDec09 \n\nEEX; F2PE; \nDec10 \n\nEEX; F2PE; \nDec11 \n\nEEX; F2PE; \nDec12 \n\nObs. 293 545 174 389 389 389 389 \nMean 11,294 11,253 3,679 7,099 7,593 8,100 8,623 \n\nVariance 5,855 10,389 3,432 3,421 3,407 3,402 3,400 \nSkewness 0,023 0,300 0,588 0,660 0,716 0,777 0,841 \n\nKurtosis 1,906 1,621 3,648 3,827 3,960 4,082 4,172 \nFIGURE 22:  DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR RISK PREMIA OF FUTURES MATURING DEC2006/DEC2012 \n\nAs we can observe, mean Phase I futures contracts risk premium and variance are \n\nclearly higher than those of Phase II. As such, we may conclude that risk premia may \n\ntend to reduce as the market matures. Besides, differences in spot and futures prices can \n\nalso be associated with weather conditions, economic activity risks, and other fuel \n\nmarkets relationships, as we have mentioned before. In summary, risk premium is a \n\nsubstantial component of carbon futures prices and in a significant way from the \n\neconomics perspective. Uncertainties over the future of EU ETS appear to be \n\ndisappearing and maybe allowances are producing the targeted results on the whole \n\neconomy, namely regarding the incorporation of externalities costs due to pollution. In \n\nfact, we must note that a competitive market should reflect the costs associated with EU \n\nETS carbon allowances and it seems that German market has started doing that.  \n\nIn order to investigate the relationship between risk premium and time-to-maturity \n\nequation (6) has been computed and results plotted in Figure 23 (there, for each future \n\ncontracts under analysis, we have plotted risk premia and time-to-maturity, in days). \n\n\n\nPage 77 of 92 \n\n \n\n \nFIGURE 23: RISK PREMIUM BY TIME-TO-MATURITY FOR EACH OF THE FIVE SAMPLE CONTRACTS \n\nIn direct contradiction with earlier results attained for electricity markets but favoring \n\nthose of Chevallier (2010), the negative relationship between risk premium and time-to-\n\nmaturity (risk premium increases with decreasing time-to-maturity) is not verified in the \n\nEEX market. In effect, Phase I futures contracts show higher risk premia in spite of \n\ntheir lower time-to-maturity. In spite of this, there is evidence of significant time-\n\nvarying risk premium in carbon allowances prices but the relationship for futures \n\n\n\nPage 78 of 92 \n\n \n\ncontracts in Phase II (2008-2012) does not seem to have changed as time-to-maturity \n\nincreases. \n\nNow, we go to the next stage and calculate the convenience yield regression computing \n\nequation (7) using for the volatility the specification of a GARCH(1,1)\n46\n\n model for the \n\nconditional variance. At the same time, we evaluate how the variance of spot prices and \n\nyields improve the forecast performance of futures premium by regressing equation (8). \n\nAt the top panel of Figure 24 below we plot the convenience yields in futures prices \n\nmaturing in November 2006 and November 2007, and at the bottom panel we plot \n\nfutures prices maturing in November 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. \n\n \n\nFIGURE 24: CONVENIENCE YIELDS IN FUTURES PRICES WITH DELIVERY IN PHASE I (TOP PANEL) AND WITH DELIVERY IN PHASE II \n\n(BOTTOM PANEL) \n\nAt a first glance we can say that the series for the convenience yields estimates differ \n\nsignificantly from Pilot Period (2005-2007) to Kyoto Period (2008-20012). Between \n\nquarter four 2005 and quarter two 2006 (top panel) the yield is positive with values \n\n0&lt;<10 and we can observe high volatilities. At the beginning of 2006, when news \n\n                                                \n\n46\n Defined by the recursive relationship . This model could be extended to a higher order GARCH(p, \n\nq) model simply by including additional lagged squared innovations and/or conditional variances on the right-hand-side of the \n\nequation. Nevertheless the GARCH(1,1) fitted just well to our purposes and is supported by the findings of, for example, Figlewski \n(1997) of GARCH(1,1) superiority confined to stock market and its volatility forecasting. \n\n\n\nPage 79 of 92 \n\n \n\nabout allowances over-allocation for the pilot period were released, it occurred a \n\nsignificant shock on carbon allowances price that also affected convenience yields, \n\nwhich decreased until -20&lt;<-25 values from Q2 2007 to Q4 2007.  \n\nShock on convenience yields for Phase II contracts showed a different pattern, with \n\nmuch lower convenience yields compared to those of Phase I. Maybe due to the larger \n\ndata span we have for empirical analysis performed, we find results that contradict those \n\nof Borak and al. (2006). The effect of price shock on futures prices was more dramatic \n\nin Phase II contracts than during Pilot Phase (2005-2007). In spite of the strong \n\nsimilarities for convenience yields in the time series of both Phases, we find different \n\nlong-term reactions to the price shock. The persistence of negative convenience yields \n\nin Phase II futures may result from market participant\u2018s expectations regarding lower \n\nallocations for the commitment period (Borak and al., 2006). Between quarters 2 and 3 \n\nof year 2008 we may say that the longer the maturity date, the higher the convenience \n\nyields. On the whole, results obtained in our analysis are opposite to those of Borak and \n\nal. (2006). However, for the description of the relationship between the convenience \n\nyields and spot prices we take these authors\u2018 work as a reference. \n\nIn Figure 25 hereafter we present the data leading to the plot of Figure 24. In this table \n\nwe present the coefficients and standard errors for the estimated regression (7) using \n\nGARCH (1,1) as computed for the volatility of spot price returns. Each column refers to \n\na different future maturing date (first line of the matrix). \n\n \n\nFIGURE 25: REGRESSION ESTIMATES FOR THE FUTURES EUAS CONVENIENCE YIELDS OF MATURITY DEC2006 \n\nTHROUGH DEC2012 FOR THE ENTIRE SAMPLE PERIOD. \n\n\n\nPage 80 of 92 \n\n \n\nExcept FutDec08, both price and volatility seem to significantly influence the \n\nconvenience yield, with its signs being as anticipated by price theories. Even though \n\nprice volatility does not have a statistically significant impact on convenience yield for \n\nPhase I futures contracts and the signs of the estimated coefficients for December 2007 \n\nthrough December 2012 contracts oppose the existent theory, it favors the results of \n\nBorak and al (2006). As a result, the spot price is positively correlated to the \n\nconvenience yield, which becomes higher the longer the date maturity is. On the whole, \n\ndue to spot prices remaining at low levels, the market still exhibits negative \n\nconvenience yields regardless of the shock. Thus, results show that convenience yields \n\ncan be explained by spot price levels and volatility, while the stochastic volatility have a \n\nnegative impact on yields.  \n\nKeeping in mind that the yield is the dividend that we receive from holding the asset (an \n\nallowance unit, in the case of carbon market), the negative sign relating both indicates \n\nthat investors may see no privilege in holding the asset with respect to futures periods \n\n(even if not statistically significant for FutDec07 and FutDec10). However, this result \n\ndeserves a deeper analysis. \n\nFinally, in an attempt to confirm the theory of commodity prices we compute equation \n\n(8) and calculate the risk premium on the volatility of spot carbon allowances and on the \n\nconvenience yield. Figure 26 show the results we have obtained. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFIGURE 26: DETERMINATION OF THE RISK PREMIUM FOR EEX EUA OF MATURITY DEC06/DEC12. \n\nOnce more we confirm that carbon spot prices volatility has a significant negative sign \n\nand this time it influences negatively the risk premium. The convenience yield seems to \n\n\n\nPage 81 of 92 \n\n \n\nhave a statistically significant, strong, positive correlation with Phase I risk premium, \n\nnamely on Phase II Kyoto period futures maturing on December 2009, 2011 and 2012. \n\nHence, in terms of volatility influence on risk premium our results are opposite of \n\npreceding theories postulates. Regarding convenience yields, at best, we can describe \n\nthe outcome of this explanatory variable as mixed. \n\nFor FutDec07 and FutDec08, this simple empirical model explains a significant portion \n\nof estimated risk premium variation. The adjusted R\n2\n is 0,59 and 0,62 respectively. For \n\nall others, it is able to explain no more than a small portion, where 0,23 &lt;R\n2 \n&lt;0,38. The \n\nresult obtained is consistent with the risk premium regressions for other financial and \n\ncommodity markets (see Wei and Zhu, 2006).  \n\n\n\nPage 82 of 92 \n\n \n\nChapter 5. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations \n\nThe purpose of this thesis has been to examine the correlation between spot and futures \n\nmarkets for CO2 emission allowances in the EU ETS, trying to contribute for a better \n\nknowledge of the carbon price discovery process. Specifically, on the basis of the \n\nGerman electricity and carbon market, the EEX, we have examined the issues of price \n\ndiscovery, market efficiency and the empirical relationship between carbon allowances \n\n(both EUA and CER) futures price and carbon spot price in the European Union carbon \n\nmarket.  \n\nKeeping this purpose in mind we have started by describing the EU ETS market \n\nfunctioning, with a particular focus on its organization, its participants, the economics \n\nof its fundamentals and the basic principles of carbon finance. After highlightening the \n\nmain characteristics of the market which might affect carbon pricing methodology, we \n\nhave carried out some empirical analysis on both spot and futures EEX time series. We \n\nhave defined and measured carbon futures risk premium and its convenience yield, we \n\nhave inspected their properties and, finally, modeled the relationship between futures \n\nand spot prices in the EU ETS using classic theories. To conclude, we have examined \n\nthe computation of risk premium and convenience yields on the basis of specifications \n\nput forward by several commodity pricing models. Since increasing historic data is \n\navailable, it has been possible for us to extend the period of analysis, comparing to other \n\nprevious studies. So, all the research was made for the first two Phases of Kyoto \n\nProtocol (the pilot period, from 2005 to 2007, and the Kyoto commitment period, from \n\n2008 to 2012).  \n\nThe statistical and econometrical analysis have showed that the historical distribution of \n\nour data diverge significantly from standard normal distribution and empirical results \n\nsuggest a changing correlation pattern between carbon futures and carbon spot prices, \n\ndepending on the type of futures contract or on the Phase we are looking at. Our \n\nfindings may be summarized as follows:  \n\nFirst, we have got evidence of contango in the EEX futures carbon market. \n\n\n\nPage 83 of 92 \n\n \n\nSecond, we found considerable differences in results obtained for different maturity \n\ncontracts and for different Kyoto Protocol trading periods. \n\nThird, the traditional negative relationship between risk premium and time-to-maturity \n\nis not verified in the EEX market.  \n\nFourth, spot prices have a significant positive influence on convenience yields; on the \n\ncontrary, price volatility seems to have a negative impact on them. More, the \n\nconvenience yield increases with time-to-delivery (the longer the latter, the higher the \n\nfirst).  \n\nFifth, there is a statistically negative relationship between price volatility and risk \n\npremium. \n\nFinally, the positive impact of the convenience yield onto the risk premium gives mix \n\nresults, depending on the Period and on futures contract used for performing the \n\ncomputation. \n\nLike Daskalakis and Markellos (2008), our results show that allowing for short-selling \n\nand banking between successive Kyoto periods could boost liquidity and develop \n\nmarket efficiency. As such, this should be taken into account in policy building. Future \n\nresearch may undertake more in-depth analysis about forecast errors, which may help \n\nfor a better understanding of differences between estimated futures price and real (ex-\n\npost) spot prices. Furthermore, price volatility, future spot prices and convenience \n\nyields don\u2018t appear to be the most important explanations for convenience yields values \n\nand for risk premia magnitudes; this led us to attempt to identify fundamental drivers \n\nfor risk premia. Fuels (coal, gas and oil), weather and market constraints, were found to \n\nbe of particular interest relating CO2 contracts to energy consumption intensity, namely \n\nto electricity spot and futures markets. \n\nMoreover, increasing impact of CO2 allowances contracts on the electricity industry\u2018s \n\ncosts show that energy market has indeed become a critical factor for carbon market \n\ndevelopment. In fact, the recently liberalized electricity market throughout Europe led \n\nto the development of environmental protection policies as newly carbon financial \n\ncontracts emerged in its context. \n\n\n\nPage 84 of 92 \n\n \n\nAgreeing with Milunovich and Joyeux (2007) we consider that, overall, it seems that the \n\nEU ETS futures market fulfils its roles of contributing to carbon price discovery process \n\nin the spot market. Even more, it starts being a mean of effective incorporation of the \n\nGHG externalities into the production cost structures and into products/services final \n\nprice. However, this relatively new market still exhibits a number of idiosyncrasies (e.g. \n\nit still lacks some market efficiency) relative to mature markets which must be taken \n\ninto account both by market operators and policy makers. Empirical results provide \n\nevidence that uncertainties over the future of carbon markets seem to be decreasing, that \n\nit has started to produce the targeted results and, finally, that the EU ETSs carbon \n\nemissions futures market is beginning to provide meaningful forward price signals to \n\nmarket participants (influencing spot electricity prices and the costs of other polluting \n\nactivities). This means that market participants are already factoring carbon prices into \n\ntheir long term business decisions, with a pass-through of additional costs caused by \n\npollution externalities into production costs at present, there is an ongoing research that \n\nis already investigating these specific aspects . \n\n\n\nPage 85 of 92 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n1.

It provided the framework for trading both electricity contracts and \ncarbon allowances contracts.  \n\nSpot trading started in 2000 and, at present, hourly and various other electricity block contracts are \n\ntraded: base ( average price for the 24 hours of the day) and peak (average price for the work day, from \n\n9a.m. to 8 p.m.) load contracts. EUA spot trading began in the early days of 2005 and, in August 2005, \n\nEEX started providing clearing services for EUA OTC trading. EUA Spot contracts have a contract \n\nvolume of 1 EUA and are traded in EUR per EUA. The settlement price is established after the end of \n\ntrading on every exchange trading day. \n\nDerivatives market in EEX started in 2001 with futures contracts on electricity indices. Three years later \n\nbegun the trading of options on these futures and in 2005 futures on physical electricity and on European \n\nCarbon Futures (ECFs) were launched. ECFs are characterized as First or Second period, depending on \n\nwhen the EUA actual delivery takes place: those which the delivery was planned to happen during the \nthree year period 2005-2007 belong to First period category, those with delivery planned to happen \n\nduring the five year period 2008-2012 belong to Second period category. Belonging to the First period, \n\nthere were traded ECFs maturing on December 2006 and on December 2007. From the Second period, \n\nECFs maturing in December 2008, December 2009, December 2010, December 2011 and December \n\n2012 were traded (the last two still are, at present).  \n\n \n\nFut Dec 06 Fut Dec 07 Fut Dec 08 Fut Dec 09 Fut Dec 10 Fut Dec 11 Fut Dec 12\n\n11,9\n***\n\n16,2\n***\n\n16,8\n***\n\n9,78\n***\n\n9,91\n***\n\n9,67\n***\n\n10,9\n***\n\n(0,42) (0,566) (0,513) (0,49) (0,617) (0,618) (0,55)\n\n -0,0414\n**\n\n -0,108\n***\n\n -1,84\n**\n\n -0,603\n***\n\n -0,571\n***\n\n -0,495\n***\n\n -0,459\n***\n\n(0,00794) (0,00664) (0,0954) (0,046) (0,0534) (0,0548) (0,0548)\n\n3,25\n***\n\n4,67\n***\n\n -2,07\n*\n\n3,07\n**\n\n2,14\n**\n\n2,94\n***\n\n2,9\n***\n\n(0,807) (0,671) (0,744) (0,943) (0,717) (0,532) (0,408)\n\nR\n2\n\n0,162 0,485 0,691 0,379 0,36 0,389 0,415\n\nN 293 545 174 389 389 389 389\n\nmodel used: RPt = s,t t t\n\nPhase I Phase II\n\nObs. -  FutDec06, FutDec07, Fut Dec08, FutDec09, FutDec10, FutDec11 and FutDec12 refer to EEX; F1PE; Dec06 and Dec07 Futures Contracts, as well \n\nas to EEX; F2PE; Dec08, 09, 10, 11 and 12 futures contracts, respectively. *** indicates 1% significance level and ** indicates 5% significance level.
