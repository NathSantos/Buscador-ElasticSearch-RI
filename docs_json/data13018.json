Not only is there a loss of binocular\nvision with reduced peripheral visual field and loss of depth perception\ncausing various job restrictions, but also a sense of facial disfigurement.\nOne\u2019s self-image, self-esteem, and self-confidence may be affected. Be-\ncause eye contact is such an essential part in human interaction, it is\n\nArtificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in\nenucleated socket with porous polyethylene\nspherical and quad-motility implant\n\nKeywords: Eye enucleation; Orbital implants; Eye, artificial; Polyethelene; Image processing,\ncomputer-assisted/methods\n\nPurpose: To compare artificial eye amplitudes in enucleated socket\nwith porous polyethylene either spherical or quad-motility implant\nand study the characteristics of artificial eyes fit with the two orbital\nimplants. Methods: A total of 21 patients were prospectively studied\nwho underwent enucleation because of an intraocular melanoma and\nthe randomization defined a porous polyethylene either spherical or\nquad-motility orbital implant. Measurements of the amplitude of the\nartificial eye were obtained with prism and digital photos. The software\nScion Image analyzed the digital photos (www.scioncorp.com) and\nthe quantitative data were allocated to groups. The measurements\n(height, length, thickness) and weight of the 21 artificial eyes were\nanalyzed. Student\u2019s t-test was performed to determine the significance\nof difference between groups (p<0.05). Results: There was no sta-\ntistically significant difference of the artificial eye amplitude analyzed\nby means of prisms between both orbital implants (p>0.05 for all\ndirections). On analyzing the digital photos, the artificial eye with\nspherical implant showed higher artificial eye amplitude downward\n(p=0.009) among patients older than 55 years old, rightward (p=0.036)\nand downward (p=0.008) among the 9 patients with enucleated right\neye. Height and length were similar in the 21 artificial eyes but those\nartificial eyes fit with quad-motility orbital implants were statistically\nsignificant thicker (p<0.001) and heavier (p=0.001). Conclusions:\nThe similar amplitude of movement of artificial eyes was observed\nwith both spherical and quad-motility orbital implants. Artificial eyes\nfit with quad-motility orbital implant are significantly thicker and\nheavier than those fit with spherical orbital implant.\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\n\nArq Bras Oftalmol. 2007;70(5):831-8\n\n832 Artificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in enucleated socket with porous polyethylene spherical and quad-motility implant\n\nextremely important for the artificial eye patient to maintain a\nnatural and normal appearance with the prosthetic eye(1-3).\n\nThe ideal orbital implant should be able to correct the\norbital volume loss as well as maintain socket motility to\nachieve maximum cosmesis with the use of prosthesis. In\naddition, it should have low exposure and migration rates, be\neconomical, technically simple to implant, and applicable for\nenucleation, evisceration or secondary orbital implantation(4).\n\nPorous polyethylene (PP) is made of synthetic material\n(high-density polyethylene powder), which is heated below\nthe melting point and molded into specific shapes (Medpor\u00ae;\nPorex Surgical Inc., Fairburn, GA, USA)(5-6). Due to its good\nmolding, tissue tolerance, and stability, porous polyethylene\nhas been used in craniofacial reconstructive surgeries since\n1982(5) and in enucleation implant since 1989(6). This material\nhas an extensive pore system that permits fibrovascular\ningrowths which has the advantage of preventing migration,\nextrusion, and infection(6). Attachment of the extra-ocular\nmuscles to the implant in locations mimicking their normal\nanatomical insertion sites optimizes implant movement\nwithout increasing the incidence of exposure(7). Porous\nimplants should be used in those patients who express an\ninterest in later peg insertion, a procedure that primarily\nimproves the amplitude of horizontal prosthetic saccades(8).\nBy 2002, PP implants were the most frequently used after\nprimary enucleation (42.7%)(9).\n\nMany shapes of orbital implants have also been deve-\nloped: the buried implants, magnets, flat anterior surface,\ntantalum mesh, protruding 4 mounds on the anterior sur-\nface(4). PP implants are available in spherical, egg, conical,\nand mounded shape (quad-motility)(9).\n\nThe placement of a peg or screw is often performed as a\nsecond procedure several months after initial placement of\nthe orbital implant, but it has been associated with conjunc-\ntival breakdown and exposure of the implant, chronic dis-\ncharge, pyogenic granulation formation, and conjunctival\novergrowth(10).\n\nThe results of a survey done with active members of the\nAmerican Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive\nSurgery (ASOPRS) showed a decline in implant pegging,\nonly 8.1% of all the implants reported were pegged(9).\n\nThe motility of a nonintegrated artificial eye may be\ncaused by at least two forces: 1) the rubbing force between the\nposterior surface of the artificial eye and the conjunctiva that\ncovers the implant may cause the artificial eye to move.\nBecause this force is likely to be approximately equal in all\ndirections, it would cause comparable horizontal and vertical\nartificial eye amplitudes; 2) an artificial eye usually fits snu-\ngly in the conjunctival space (possibly not in the superior\nfornix). During upgaze and downgaze, the upper and lower\neyelids move along with the eye (or implant), albeit with a\nsmaller amplitude. Consequently, the upper and lower forni-\nces also move upward and downward, and thereby contribute\nto the vertical amplitude of the artificial eye. In contrast, the\nmedial and lateral canthi hardly move during horizontal eye\n\n(or implant) movements. Therefore, the medial and lateral\nconjunctival fornices probably move much less than the\nupper and lower fornices(11).\n\nThe quad-motility implant (Medpor\u00ae; Porex Surgical Inc.,\nFairburn, GA, USA) is a rounded orbital implant with four\nmounds located anteriorly. The anterior mounds provide pro-\njections in the Tenon capsule and conjunctiva that allow\ncoupling of the implant with the ocular prosthesis without\npenetrating the conjunctiva. These mounds also may partially\nsupport the weight of the prosthesis, thereby reducing the\namount of weight being supported by the lower eyelid and\nfornix, which often leads to lower eyelid droop(4).\n\nThe quad-motility implant is available in three sizes: small,\nmedium, and large, approximating the volume of a 16-, 18-,\nand 20- millimeter sphere. The spherical implant is available in\nfour sizes: 16-, 18-, 20-, and 22- millimeter of diameter(4).\n\nSynchronous simultaneous movements of the two eyes in\nthe same direction are called versions. The versions fulfill the\nfirst two tasks assigned to the motor system of the eyes: to\nenlarge the field of view and to bring the object of attention\nonto the fovea. In this study, prisms were used to evaluate the\nprosthesis motility based on voluntary version as the patient\u2019s\nonly eye was looking to an object located at 1 m of distance.\nPrisms are able to evaluate the artificial eye amplitude in the\ncentral visual field.\n\nTo digitalize one image means to give space value (x; y)\nand the light to the points (pixels) that makes the figure. The\nimage can be analyzed by a specific program that, manipu-\nlating mathematics of the pixels, allows to analyze the mar-\ngins and make the measurements of any parameter(12). Digital\nphotos were taken of each patient in the ocular primary\nposition and at the four main gazes to evaluate the artificial\neye amplitude in the external visual field.\n\nIn normal individuals there is an age-related decrease in\nextra-ocular muscle function. Aging anophthalmic patients\nshould exhibit a gradual loss of large-amplitude prosthetic\nmovement, while the animated small-amplitude excursions\nare preserved. The motility benefits of pegged hydroxyapatite\nmay thus become less significant with advancing age(13).\n\nTo evaluate the current assumption that quad-motility\norbital implant yields better artificial eye motility than sphe-\nrical orbital implant, we compared the amplitude and the\ncharacteristics of the artificial eye in patients who randomly\nreceived either quad-motility or spherical porous polyethy-\nlene orbital implant. Prism and digital photos were a quan-\ntitative method to analyze the artificial eye amplitude.\n\nMETHODS\n\nPatients\n\nPatients from the oncology sector of the Department of\nOphthalmology of the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, who\nunderwent enucleation because of an intraocular melanoma,\nwithout extrascleral extension on ultrasound examination,\n\n\n\nArq Bras Oftalmol. 2007;70(5):831-8\n\nArtificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in enucleated socket with porous polyethylene spherical and quad-motility implant 833\n\nwere eligible for the study. We excluded patients with a low\nvisual acuity in the remaining eye and patients with a history\nof strabismus, any eye surgery, or orbital disorders.\n\nA total of 21 patients were eligible for this study. During\nthe surgery, 11 patients received the spherical implant and 10\npatients received the quad-motility implant (Figure 1).\n\nThe age of the patients ranged from 31 to 80 years. The\npatients were separated into two groups: under and over 55\nyears old.\n\nRandomization\n\nThe type of implant was selected immediately before sur-\ngery by opening an envelope with a previously randomized\nassignment. The surgeon did not perform the amplitudes of\nthe artificial eye recordings. Until after the artificial eye\nrecordings, the investigators who recorded the eye amplitude,\nas well as the patients, were unaware of the type of enuclea-\ntion implant.\n\nSurgical technique\n\nThe same surgeon made the 21 surgeries. The patient\nentered the operation room with a skin mark on the forehead\nshowing the side of the surgery. Enucleation was performed\nas follows: 1) 360\u00b0 peritomy, blunt dissection of conjunctiva,\nunder Tenon\u2019s capsule and between the rectus muscles; 2) the\nfour rectus muscles were identified with a squint hook and cut\nfrom the eye after a 5-0 polyglactin double-armed suture\nwhich was passed just posterior to each tendon; 3) the optic\nnerve was cut with curved scissors; 4) disinsertion of both\noblique muscles during the eye removal; 5) hemostasis with\nfinger pressure; 6) implant inserted in the orbit with an\nimplant introducer (the four mounds of the quad-motility\nimplant were located anteriorly); 7) the four rectus muscles\nwere directly sutured on the surface of the orbital implant\nwith 5-0 polyglactin suture; 8) the two oblique muscles were\n\nleft untagged; 9) the anterior surface of both implants was\nwrapped with autogenous tissue (deep temporalis fascia); 9)\nTenon\u2019s capsule and conjunctiva were closed in separate\nlayers with 6-0 polyglactin; and 10) temporary tarsorrhaphy\nwith 4-0 silk.\n\nAn algorithm has been developed to determine the appro-\npriate locations for the reattachment of the four rectus mus-\ncles (Table 1) on the spherical implant(7). The reattachment of\nthe four rectus muscles on the quad motility was done on the\nmargin of the tunnels among the four mounds.\n\nFollow-up\n\nAt the first postoperative visit, the bandage was changed.\nThe second postoperative visit was scheduled 3 days after\nsurgery. At that visit, the bandage and the temporary tarsor-\nrhaphy were removed. The socket was inspected and the\npatient used topical antibiotics drops four times a day until the\n30th postoperative day. The third postoperative visit was 2\nweeks after surgery and the conjunctival suture was removed\nunder topical proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%.\n\nSix weeks after the surgery, the patients were referred to\nthe ocularist to fit the artificial eye. The anterior surface of the\nartificial eye was made based on the contralateral eye (color\nof iris, color of sclera, size of pupil) and the posterior surface\nwas made with mold of impression.\n\nThe patients returned to the clinic after six weeks for mea-\nsurements of the amplitude of the artificial eye, which were\n\nFigure 1 - Spherical and Quad-motility orbital implant\n\nTable 1.

The prosthesis was mea-\nsured using pachymetry (height, length and thickness) and\ndigital balance (weight).\n\nArtificial eye amplitude recordings\n\nPrism was placed in front of the eye and the fixation point\nwas located at one meter. The observer noted the eye and the\nartificial eye movements. The prismatic dioptria was increa-\nsed until no improvement in artificial eye motility. The smal-\nlest prismatic dioptria that showed the best artificial eye mo-\nvement, was considered the result.\n\nPhotos were taken with digital camera (Sony, Cyber-shot,\n3.3 mega pixels) in the primary position and four extreme\ngaze positions. A standard millimeter ruler was placed close\nto the artificial eye. The software Scion Image (www.scioncorp.\ncom/scion_image_windows.htm) was used to analyze the pho-\ntos, with a standard way of measurements of the five photos\n(Figure 2).\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nStatistical analysis was performed with EPI INFO, Ver-\nsion 6.04. Quantitative data for groups (enucleated eye, age\nand orbital implant) and artificial eyes are presented as mean\nand standard deviation(14). Student\u2019s t-test was performed to\ndetermine the significance of differences among groups. The\ncriterion for significance was p<0.05.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDemography\n\nOf a total of 21 patients eligible for this study, 11 were\nmale (52.4%) and 10 were female (47.6%).

Six\npatients had the implant in the right orbit and four patients had\nthe implant in the left orbit.

Nine patients\nhad the implant in the right orbit and 2 patients had the\nimplant in the left orbit. The size of the implants was 18 (6\ncases) and 20 (5 cases).

Analyzing the re-\nsults, he could infer that volume and motility are factors that\nprevent the contractional process of the anophthalmic socket.\nThe study leads to this conclusion, reinforcing that in order to\n\navoid cavity contraction it is necessary to perform a primary\norbital implantation in cases of evisceration or enucleation. It\nis possible to achieve a good final result by the use of a\ntechnically well-fitted artificial eye(15).\n\nSome details of the surgical technique for all patients in\nthis study seem to improve the cosmetic results. The four\nrectus muscles were directly sutured on the surface of the\nquad-motility and spherical orbital implant. Other authors\nhave used the same technique(11,16-17), although others have\nreattached the six muscles(7).\n\nAnderson and co-authors advanced the four extraocular\nmuscles over the front of the implant by suturing the medial\nand lateral rectus muscle together in the horizontal channel of\nthe implant and suturing the superior and inferior rectus\nmuscles in the vertical channel(4). We believe that this sutu-\nring extraocular muscle procedure will block the orbital\nimplant motility. In this study, the suture of the extraocular\nmuscles in the quad-motility was done at the respective mar-\ngin of each channel. There was no difference of location of\nthe four extraocular muscle sutures in the quad-motility or-\nbital implant like it happens in spherical orbital implants.\n\nThe anterior surfaces of both orbital implants were co-\nvered with a patch of autogenous material (deep temporalis\nfascia). A comparative study of bovine pericardium versus\nhomologous sclera as wrapping for hydroxyapatite orbital\nimplants showed a significantly higher incidence of exposure\nwith bovine pericardium(18). The use of banked sclera as a\npatch may potentially contain human immunodeficiency\nvirus(19) or other infectious agents(20). Temporalis fascia as a\npatch graft has several advantages. The procedure is safe and\nmay be performed in the same surgical field. As it is an\nautologous graft, there will no be immunological reaction.\nThere is no risk of disease transmission. The temporalis fascia\nis a sturdy fibrous tissue thick enough to cover the anterior\nsurface of both orbital implants but thin enough to be con-\ncealed, pliable, and easy to work with(21). The placement of\nunwrapped hydroxyapatite implants after enucleation pro-\nvides essentially the same motility as wrapped implants(22).\nThe middle path sclera provides the combined advantages of\na wrapped implant (additional barrier of protection between\nthe rough surface of the implant and conjunctiva) and an\nunwrapped implant (better and faster vascularization).\n\nIn our study, all patients were referred to the ocularist 6\nweeks after surgery. At this postoperative time there was no\nedema, no conjunctival inflammation or dehiscence. Some\nauthors studied early replacement of the conformer by an\nocular prosthesis. It was done in 12 enucleated patients, who\nwere pleased with the cosmetic benefit afforded by the early\nintroduction of the prosthesis(23).\n\nTo compare the motility of sclera-covered hydroxyapatite\nand alloplastic enucleation implants, a retrospective, non-\nrandomized comparative trial was done with 76 anophthalmic\npatients, who were examined less than 120 days after surgery.\nBoth orbital implants showed similar movement, although\ndirectly coupling hydroxyapatite implants to the prosthesis\n\nTable 8.

There appears to be no motility benefit of nonpegged\nhydroxyapatite over spherical alloplastic implants(24).\n\nBy the methodology used in this study, the patients were\nexamined with the artificial eye and the amplitude of mo-\nvement of the artificial eye was analyzed by two methods: (1)\nprism and (2) computer program Scion Image. A more detai-\nled statistical analysis was performed of this subset of vertical\n(up and downward) and horizontal (right and leftward) move-\nment. The enucleated eye was also considered, once right or\nleftward are done with different muscles when the enucleated\neye is the right or the left one.\n\nA randomized trial with the purpose of comparing artifici-\nal eye amplitudes in patients who received either a hydroxy-\napatite or an acrylic, sclera-covered spherical implant after\nenucleation showed that, when no motility peg is placed,\nacrylic and hydroxyapatite spherical implants yield com-\nparable saccadic amplitudes of the artificial eye. However,\nsaccadic symmetry did not differ significantly between the\nacrylic group and the hydroxyapatite group (p>0.1 for any\nsaccadic direction). Artificial eye amplitudes were markedly\nmore restricted horizontally than vertically. In all saccadic\ndirections, the relation between target amplitude and artificial\neye amplitude was linear(11).\n\nLarger implants seem to provide improved implant moti-\nlity, which should result in more dramatic prosthetic move-\nment. Several factors must be considered in choosing the\nappropriate size of implant for a particular patient. Exces-\nsively large implants may increase the risk of extrusion, make\nprosthesis fitting difficult, or result in patient discomfort.\nIdeally, sufficient space must remain in the socket to allow\nfitting of prosthesis with at least 2 ml of volume and approxi-\nmately 4 mm central thickness(25). In this study, the central\nthickness of the artificial eye fitted with spherical orbital\nimplant had a mean of 4.5 mm, but with quad-motility orbital\nimplant had a mean of 7.68 mm.\n\nSome authors found that shell volume was broadly related\nto shell weight, though neither measurement was related to\ncosmetic result. Those patients without orbital implants had a\nmean shell weight of 3.1 g, as compared with 2.8 g in those\nwith implants(26). The patients of this study, with spherical orbital\nimplants had a mean artificial eye weight of 1.79 g, as com-\npared with 2.69 g in those with quad-motility orbital implant.\n\nImplant motility appears to decline with age(13). This was\ndemonstrated by our study and it is the reason why patients\nwere divided into two groups of age: younger and older than\n55 years, based on the mean age of the 21 patients. In a group\nof patients younger than 55 years old, there was no difference\nof artificial eye amplitude for any gaze. In a group of patients\nolder than 55 years, there was statistically significant diffe-\nrence only downward (p=0.009), with spherical orbital im-\nplants showing better results.\n\nTo evaluate the eyelid position before and after the exter-\nnal prosthesis adaptation, using digital image processing te-\nchniques, 18 patients were evaluated at the \u201cFaculdade de Me-\n\ndicina de Botucatu - Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP\u201d,\nwith and without the external prosthesis. Qualitative and\nquantitative analysis were made using the Scion Image Pro-\ngram. The image processing allowed objective evaluations of\nthe measures, contributing to the patient follow-up(27). This\nwas also observed in the measurements of this study, which\nwere adequate, simple and reliable in enucleated patients.\n\nBecause the image processing was done with extreme\ngaze in this study, measurements of the prosthesis motility\nwere also obtained with prism, to evaluate central visual field\nonce, in conversational speech ocular movements are limited\nto low-amplitude saccades within a few degrees of primary\nposition. While tracking objects, the eyes rotate only approxi-\nmately 10\u00ba to 15\u00ba before head turn naturally occurs(27). In this\nstudy, all results are higher than 15\u00ba and artificial eye motility\nat the central visual field can be considered acceptable for\nboth orbital implants.\n\nIsolated innervations to an extraocular muscle of the eye\ndo not occur, nor can the muscles from one eye alone be inner-\nvated. Impulses to perform an eye movement are always\nintegrated, and all ocular movements are associated. Whene-\nver an impulse for the performance of an eye movement is\nsent out, corresponding muscles of each eye receive equal\ninnervations to contract or relax. In enucleated patients, the\nonly eye is going to focus the object located at 1m of distance\nand the orbital implant is going to follow the only eye. The\neyes move toward the apex of the prisms. If the prisms are\nplaced base-out in front of the eyes, they must converge; if the\nprisms are placed base-in, the eyes must diverge. If the prisms\nare placed base-up or base-down, the eyes must perform a\nvertical movement. The only four main directions were eva-\nluated in this study.\n\nIn this study, abduction of the artificial eye is significantly\nbetter than adduction for both orbital implant. Others authors\ncompared outcomes of enucleation and evisceration. They\nconcluded that abduction of the orbital implant is also signi-\nficantly better than adduction in eviscerated eyes and implant\nmotility is greater than prosthesis motility(28).\n\nThe efficiency of transmitting movement from the implant\nto the prosthesis determines the degree of the prosthetic mo-\ntility. Movement is transmitted from orbital implant through\nsurface tension at the conjunctival-prosthetic interface and\nmovement of the fornices(25). The quad-motility orbital im-\nplants have irregularly shaped surfaces that create indirect\ncoupling mechanism between the implant and prosthesis that\nimparts greater movement to the prosthesis(4,25).\n\nThis study showed that spherical and quad motility orbital\nimplants yield comparable artificial eye motility, although\nthe artificial eyes fit with a quad motility orbital implant are\nthicker and heavier.\n\nRESUMO\n\nObjetivos: Comparar a amplitude de movimento da pr\u00f3tese\nocular em cavidade enucleada e com implante orbit\u00e1rio esf\u00e9-\n\n\n\nArq Bras Oftalmol. 2007;70(5):831-8\n\n838 Artificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in enucleated socket with porous polyethylene spherical and quad-motility implant\n\nrico e \u201cquad-motility\u201d e estudar as caracter\u00edsticas das pr\u00f3teses\noculares adaptadas com os dois modelos de implantes orbit\u00e1-\nrios.
