The objective of \ntissue engineering is to provide effective solutions in the treatment and healing \nof bone defects in a long-term. The present work gives a new option for the \nfabrication of bone scaffolds with controlled porosity that can be designed for \nthe optimization of the implants. Highly concentrated colloidal inks were \nprepared with the aim of using them in a robotic deposition device called \nrobocasting. Three types of calcium phosphate powders doped with strontium \nwere synthesized, calcined, comminuted and characterized. Concentrated \nsuspensions with 60 vol% of solid content were successfully prepared and their \nphysical properties modified afterwards in order to obtain inks with optimal \nbehavior for direct-write assembly.  Different three-dimensional architectures \nwere made through robotic deposition, then dried and sinterized maintaining \ntheir shape.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nList of Figures \n\nFigure 1.

Introduction \nEvery year, there are millions of people around the world who need some kind of \n\nprostheses, and the need for all kinds of implants became very well known in our \n\nsocieties. The medicine field has experience great advances in the last decades and \n\nthe main motivation for this was to increase life expectancy. According to the \n\ndemographic forecasts for the near future in the developed countries, the percentage \n\nof elder people would be considerably bigger than in infants and teenagers. \n\n \n\nThe massive longevity of the population encourages the researchers to develop new \n\nsolutions that help to maintain a good quality of life at the elder age. The new motto is \n\nnot only to preserve the life of patients but also to provide reliable long-term medical \n\nsolutions. This has also positively influenced the surgical procedures bringing \n\nimprovements in the techniques, and accelerated the development of new prostheses \n\nand orthopedic implants to replace or regenerate bone tissues. These should be \n\nmade of biocompatible materials that ensure an acceptable lifetime for the patient, \n\nand provide the best performance.  \n\n \n\nWhen bone suffers damage due to a fracture, disease (osteoporosis, for instance) or \n\nwear (in the case of joints), and there is a need to replace it either entirely or in a \n\npartial manner, the traditional method has been to use either autograft (a graft of the \n\npatient\u00b4s own bone) or allograft (a graft from another human, via a bone bank). The \n\nformer requires a additional operation to harvest the bone (from the iliac crest, for \n\nexample), and this results in increased pain, risk of infection, post-operative care and \n\ncost. The quantity of autograft available is limited according to each patient. Allograft \n\nbone is also limited in availability, and carries a serious risk of disease transmission, \n\nas well as non-optimal performance of the graft.\n1\n \n\n \n\nThe new approach is to produce implants made of biomaterials to replace bone, \n\nwhich should match the functional requirements and characteristics of the natural \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           3 \n \n\ntissue. This means that orthopaedic implants should be biocompatible, corrosion \n\nresistant, mechanically resistant, and promote osseointegration.  \n\n2. Literature Review \n\n2.1. Biomaterials \n\nA biomaterial can be defined as any material used to restore a part or function of \n\nnatural living tissue or organ in the body in a safe, reliable and physiologically \n\ncompatible way.\n2 \n\nBiomaterials can be either synthetic as polymers, metals, ceramics \n\nand composites, or even biological as wood, bone and cells. Some examples of \n\nbiomaterials as well as its advantages, disadvantages and possible applications are \n\nshown on Table 1.  They can be also classified according to their biological behaviour \n\nbased on the response of the recipient living tissue or environment:\n3\n \n\n? Bioinert materials, when introduced to the body do not cause any reaction or \n\ninteract with the biological tissue, meaning that the host won\u00b4t recognized them \n\nas a strange body. Examples: titanium, zirconia and alumina. \n\n? Biotolerant materials are not necessarily rejected by the host but rather \n\nmoderately accepted by the recipient tissue which encapsulates the implant \n\nwith a fibrous interface. Examples: stainless steel, glass, chromium-cobalt \n\nfibers and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). \n\n? Bioactive materials may cause a reaction or have an effect on the living \n\nenvironment, also due to their composition are capable of forming a direct link \n\nwith the tissue. In the case of bone grafts, these materials have calcium and/or \n\nphosphate ions that help them to get attached to the surrounding bone. \n\nExamples: hydroxiapatite, bioactive glasses. \n\n? Biodegradable/reabsorbable materials are those that suffer of slow \n\ndegradation and gradual substitution of the host tissue. Examples: tricalcium \n\nphosphate and bioactive glass. \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           4 \n \n\nIn order to achieve an optimal restoration of a bone graft, three different processes \n\nmust take place:\n4 \n\n1) osteoinduction- estimulation for the production of sufficient \n\nosteoblasts (the mononucleate cells responsible for bone formation) and the factors \n\nto promote their differentiation are provided, 2) osteoconduction- these cells should \n\nbe able to adhere, grow and infiltrate on the implant, and finally 3) osseointegration- \n\nthe successful anchorage of an implant achieved by direct bone to implant contact. \n\nLooking for the ideal biomaterial for a specific bone restoration might become difficult \n\nconsidering that some materials match and even exceed the required mechanical \n\nproperties, but do not promote these processes, or it can happen to be the other way \n\naround. For these reason, the best option is to combine two biomaterials with different \n\nmechanical, structural and chemical properties that can complement each other in a \n\nbalanced manner. \n\nTable1. Class of Materials Used in the Body\n2 \n\n \n\n2.2 Tissue Engineering \n\nWhen tissue is severely damaged or lost, including its extracellular matrix (ECM) it is \n\nnot possible to restore it just with the supply of drugs, structural proteins and growing \n\nfactors. It is necessary to provide a new biological or artificial ECM so the cells can \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           5 \n \n\nproduce neotissue. This substitute of the native matrix is called \u201cscaffold\u201d and it is \n\nbasically a three-dimensional support that serves as a template for the infiltration and \n\nproliferation of cells into the damaged tissue or organ.\n5\n The scaffold must have the \n\narchitecture on which neotissue is desired to grow and provide sufficient support \n\nwhile the tissue is growing. In the case of bone scaffolds for orthopaedic applications, \n\nthese should have enough mechanical resistance to withstand the required degree of \n\nloading during their use in vivo. \n\nBone is constituted by different types of cells (osteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, \n\nosteocytes, osteoclasts) which are in need of proper vascularization, and they are \n\nprotected by a strong composite matrix made of interwoven fibrous proteins (collagen, \n\nadhesion proteins). Bone matrix is a natural composite  significantly mineralized (65% \n\nby weight) with a complex structure organized into lamellae (plate-like structure).\n6 \n\nIt \n\nconsists of collagen bundles which have been infiltrated by a crystalline mineral \n\nphase very similar to synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA)Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The main \n\ndifference is that some of the tetrahedral [PO4]3- phosphate groups have been \n\nreplaced by planar [CO3]2- carbonate groups, so it can be described as carbonated \n\nhydroxyapatite (CHA). It has been shown that \u201ccollagen and the apatite mineral form \n\ncontinuous, independent, interpenetrating networks\u201d.\n6-8 \n\nAs it can be seen of Fig. 1, bone is anatomically differentiated depending on its \n\nstructural features and it can be defined as either compact (cortical) bone or spongy \n\n(cancellous or trabecular) bone. The compact bone is very dense with only 10% of \n\ninternal porosity, and the spongy bone on the other hand has an interconnecting \n\nporous architecture ranging from 50 to 90% of porosity and made up of curvilinear \n\nstruts called trabeculae.\n6  \n\nWhile the cortical bone is mainly found on the shafts of long \n\nbones like the femur and tibia, the cancellous bone appears at the ends of long bones \n\nand in the vertebral body.  \n\nBone scaffolds should have a certain degree of porosity according to the targeted \n\nspot of the bone to be restored. This porosity should be comprised of macro- and \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           6 \n \n\nmicro-interconnected pores that not only help to mimic the architecture of the \n\nreplaced piece, but also contributes to the mass transport properties necessary for \n\nthe osteoinduction, osteoconduction and osseointegration. Nevertheless, porous \n\nscaffolds are inherently weak, especially if they are made of calcium phosphates, and \n\nit is necessary to optimize their mechanical resistance so that they can give the \n\nrequired support while bone regenerates and they are slowly reabsorbed. This can be \n\ndone by characterizing and simulating the mechanical performance of each specific \n\nthree-dimensional architecture with the aid of a finite element modelling (FEM) \n\nsoftware.\n7 \n\nIndeed, many features must be taken into account when developing an \n\noptimal scaffold for a certain application; properties of the material, morphology and \n\nstructure, type and volume fraction of the pores, as well as its interfacial state and \n\ndegradation rate.\n8 \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Anatomy of the Bone\n9\n \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           7 \n \n\n2.3. Calcium Phosphates \n\nCalcium phosphate biomaterials are polycrystalline ceramics deriving from individual \n\ncrystals of a highly oxidized substance (calcium salt) that have been fused together. \n\nThe two most widely used are tricalcium phosphate Ca3(PO4)2 (in its ?-TCP phase or \n\n?-whitlockite), and hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2.\n10\n\n Both materials are known to be \n\nbiocompatible, osteoconductive and to promote osseointegration. However, they are \n\nnot osteoinductive, meaning that they are uncapable of producing bone in the \n\nabsence of bone cells. The main differences between these two materials is that \n\ntricalcium phosphate (TCP) presents faster in vivo degradation (due to its higher \n\nsolubility in water), while hydroxyapatite provides better mechanical resistance.\n8-10 \n\nThese bioceramics have been used for decades in orthopaedic and maxillofacial \n\napplications including: repair of bone and periodontal defects, alveolar ridge \n\naugmentation, ear implants, maxillofacial reconstruction, spine fusion, bone space \n\nfillers, bone cement additives, composites and metal implant coatings.\n8   \n\nBoth of these \n\ntwo biomaterials show a promising future for bone tissue engineering applications by \n\nthe fabrication of scaffolds.  \n\nTricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite can even be mixed into a biphasic calcium \n\nphosphate material (BCP) that combines the great biodegradability of ?-TCP with the \n\nstrong mechanical properties of HA.\n11 \n\nIncreasing the ?-TCP/HA ratio will give a more \n\nbiodegradable material since ?-TCP dissolves preferentially from its matrix, releasing \n\ncalcium and phosphate ions to the media, enhancing the in vivo activity and \n\ndecreasing the resorption time. Simultaneously, a higher ?-TCP/HA ratio will diminish \n\nthe mechanical strength in the BCP material. However, it has been proved that the \n\nmixture of calcium phosphates turns out to be the ideal choice.\n11 \n\nSintered hydroxyapatite has higher crystallinity than mineral bone and as a \n\nconsequence a lower rate of degradation, so it can take more than five years to be \n\nreabsorbed by the body, while tricalcium phosphate can be completely degraded in \n\none or two years.\n12 \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           8 \n \n\nThe ?-phase of tricalcium phosphate is unstable at low temperatures and it is \n\nobtained by heating the ?-phase at temperatures higher than 1150\no\nC, although the \n\nprecise temperature at which this occurs has not been found yet. On the other hand, \n\n?-TCP cannot be obtained by direct precipitation, it is rather the result from the \n\ncalcinations of Ca deficient apatites at 700-800\no\nC, together with water loss as \n\ndescribed by the following equation:\n13 \n\n                                 Ca9(HPO4)(PO4)5(OH) ? 3Ca3(PO4)2+H2O                               (1) \n\nIn the case of HA, it can be obtained by different methods such as 1) precipitation, 2) \n\nthermal treatments at high temperature or even 3) hydrothermal conversion from \n\ncoral.\n8-14\n\nSince hydroxyapatite is non-stoichiometric it can be made by mixing \n\nsolutions with calcium and phosphate ions in a Ca/P=1.67 ratio with a pH>9. In the \n\nsecond method, HA is obtained by solid state reactions starting from other calcium \n\nphosphates (monetite or brushite) that contain CaO, Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 at \n\ntemperatures around 1200\no\nC and having an atmosphere with the same volumes of \n\nwater vapour (as a source of OH\n- \n\ngroups) and oxygen.\n14\n\nOn the third method, HA \n\nreplaces the aragonite while preserving the porous structure. The following exchange \n\ntakes place:\n18 \n\n       10CaCO3 + 6(NH4)2HPO4+2H2O   ? Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2+6(NH4)2CO3+4H3CO3   (2) \n\nIn order to compare the properties of different calcium phosphate bioceramics (HA, ?-\n\nTCP and BCP) J.Franco et al. prepared and tested dense ceramic samples by cold \n\nisostatic pressing at 1.4GPa followed by sintering in air.\n11\n\n The results are shown on \n\nTable 2. The densities were determined by the Archimedes method. Flexural \n\nstrengths were measured in four-point bending, while plane strain fracture toughness \n\nmeasurements were performed on single end notch bend specimens loaded in three \n\npoint bending. \n\nOn Table 3, the mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite are compared with those \n\nfrom other bioceramics and also from human bone (cancellous and cortical). As it can \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           9 \n \n\nbe noted, HA presents compressive strength values that are five times higher than \n\ncompact bone and twice bending strength. However, cortical bone shows much better \n\nfracture toughness and significantly lower elastic modulus. For this reason HA is not a \n\ngood option for repairing defects in high-load bones, such as femoral and tibial bones. \n\nTable 2.

Mechanical properties of bioactive ceramics and human cortical and cancellous bones\n15 \n\n \n\nLately, ionic incorporations into calcium phosphates bioceramics, such as magnesium \n\n(Mg), zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr), have had increasing interest in the bone tissue \n\nengineering field due to properties enhancement and the benefitial mechanisms that \n\nthey induce after implantation.\n16 \n\nIn the case of Sr, it became really popular in the \n\nprevention and treatment of osteoporosis as a ranelate compound due to its  ability to \n\nprevent bone loss by a mechanism of reducing bone resorption and promoting bone \n\nformation.\n17\n\n In vitro studies have shown that strontium ranelate  increases collagen \n\nand non-collagen protein synthesis, enhances preosteoblastic cell proliferation, \n\ndepresses osteoclast differentiation, and reduces the osteoclasts function.\n18\n\nOnce it is \n\nadministrated in the body as Sr salt, it seeks for bone and diffuses into the Haversian \n\ncapillaries walls until it reaches the extracellular fluid where it can be deposited into \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           10 \n \n\nthe mineral structure or substitute the Ca positions in bone crystals thanks to their \n\nchemical analogy.\n 17\n\n \n\n2.4. Solid Free-form (SFF) Fabrication Techniques \n\nLately, the different additive manufacturing  (AP) techniques provide a suitable \n\nsolution for designing and producing patient oriented customized implants at a \n\nreasonable cost. Such techniques are or also called solid free-form fabrication (SFF) \n\nor layered manufacturing since it builds an object layer by layer via the processing of \n\nsolid sheet, liquid or powder material, using two- dimensional sections.\n19\n\n This \n\ntechnology allows producing dimensionally-accurate three dimensional (3D) models \n\ndirectly from computer-aided design (CAD) files without using hard tooling, moulds or \n\ndies.\n19 \n\nFortunately, the modern medical imaging techniques like computerized tomography \n\n(CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also based on layers and \n\nthe format of the images can be transformed to a CAD file (Fig.2). This allows to take \n\nthe medical images of the injured bone from any patient, and to use them to design \n\nand produce orthopaedic implants through additive manufacturing.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Three-dimensional view of a skull from a CT scan\n20 \n\n \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           11 \n \n\nThe rapid manufacturing systems available on today include stereolitography, fused \n\ndeposition modelling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), ink-jet and three \n\ndimensional printing (3DP), hot-melt printing, electron beam melting (EBM), and \n\nrobocasting.\n19\n\n \n\n \n\nConventional porous scaffold fabrication methods (including solvent casting along \n\nwith particulate leaching, gas foaming, freeze drying, fibre meshing, melt moulding, \n\nphase separation and supercritical-fluid technology) do not provide precise control \n\nover pore size, geometry and spatial distribution.\n21 \n\nAs a solution, SFF techniques are \n\nvery useful for the design and fabrication of bone scaffolds with complex shapes, \n\ngiving the advantage to create optimal internal porous structures that can provide the \n\ndesired mechanical resistance along with the required permeability and diffusion \n\nproperties, being possible to create interconnected porosity for osteoconduction and \n\neven internal channels for  the micro-vascularization of the scaffold.\n21 \n\n \n\nIn order to fabricate bioceramic scaffolds, some of these solid freeform techniques \n\nfabricate the scaffold via an indirect process that involves the preparation of a lost \n\nmould (negative replica of the desired structure) made of an organic material (usually \n\npolymer or wax). The ceramic slurry is infiltrated into the mould, then dried and \n\nheated up at the melting temperature of the secondary material (to get rid of it), and \n\nfinally the scaffold is sintered at a higher temperature.\n22 \n\nSuch is the case of \n\nstereolitograhy and fused deposition modelling. \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Indirect processing of ceramic structures via rapid prototyping processes.\n22\n\n \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           12 \n \n\nThe main problem with this indirect procedure is that the removal of the polymer or \n\nwax can delay for too long, it often takes days to obtain scaffolds that are free of \n\norganic defects.\n23\n\n \n\nThe 3DP technique consists on distributing a powder over a surface over which a \n\nmulti-channel ink-jet head selectively applies an adhesive (binder) which hardens the \n\ndesire geometry of each section. The platforms move vertically until the piece is \n\nentirely finished by simultaneously covering the surface each time with a new layer of \n\npowder. There have been attempts to used CaP powders to produce scaffolds, \n\nthough the main constraint is the toxicity of the binders.\n24\n\n Also, the process itself \n\nproduces scaffolds with rough surfaces and limited feature resolution.\n23\n\n \n\n \n\nSimilarly, SLS also uses powder to make the template, but instead of injecting the \n\nbinder it uses a sintering device that consists of an automated infrared beam which \n\ncovers the section that will become solid. Researchers from the University of Texas at \n\nAustin,\n25\n\n developed an indirect process for preparing porous, shaped implants made \n\nof calcium meta-phospthate powder (with a calcium to phosphorus molar ratio of 0.9) \n\nby selective laser sintering. Such powder is obtained after thermally reacting a \n\nmixture of monocalcium phosphate (MCP, Ca(H2PO4)2) and dicalcium phosphate \n\n(DCP, CaHPO4) at 1000 ?C for 12 h, then allowing to cool at 500 \no\nC and the \n\nquenching in water. Afterwards, the powder was comminuted in a mechanical grinder \n\nat 20,000 rpm during 2 min, and then sieved with a size fraction of 106-125 \u00b5m in \n\norder to give a pore size distribution of 10-200 \u00b5m for the implant.  \n\n \n\nThe indirect process for  making CaP scaffolds through SLS  uses a fusible polymer \n\nbinder that is either coated on the desired substrate particles, typically by fluidized \n\nbed processes, or simply mixed with those particles.The obtained implants (Figure 4) \n\nhad a very low relative density (50%) due to the porosity, and their compressive \n\nstrength (70 MPa) was not enough for load-bearing applications. However, they are \n\nsuitable for maxillofacial applications of bone replacement, since in the in-vivo tests \n\nexhibited good biocompatibility and osseointegration. \n25 \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           13 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.

Robocasting \n\nAlso called direct-write assembly, differs from the other SFF techniques being the \n\nonly one to allow building ceramic scaffolds using water-based inks with minimal \n\norganic content (<1wt%) without the need for sacrificial support materials or \n\nmould.\n26\n\nThis technique consists on the robotic deposition of highly concentrated \n\ncolloidal suspensions (inks) capable of fully supporting their own weight during \n\nassembly. A 3D structure is printed directly as a network of ink rods through the \n\ndeposition nozzle.\n26\n\nRobocasting allows to produce periodic structures with spanning \n\nfeatures that vary between ~100\u00b5m and a few millimetres, with rod diameters that \n\nranges also in the meso-scale. \n\nWhen preparing the ink, the important relations between colloidal stability, rheological \n\nbehaviour, and ceramics fabrication must be taking into account.  First, they must \n\nexhibit a well-controlled viscoelastic response; that is, they must be able to flow \n\nthrough a deposition nozzle and then \u201cset\u201d immediately to facilitate shape retention of \n\nthe deposited features even as they span gap in the underlying layers.\n27\n\n Second, they \n\nmust contain high colloid volume fractions to minimize drying-induced shrinkage after \n\nassembly; that is, the particle network must be able to resist compressive stresses \n\narising from capillary tension.\n27 \n\nTo obtain an ink with such characteristics, careful \n\ncontrol of the colloidal forces is necessary to prepare a highly concentrated stable \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           14 \n \n\nsuspension and then induce a system change (by modifying the pH, ionic strength or \n\nsolvent quality) that causes a fluid-to-gel transition, see Fig.5. \n\n \n\nFigura 5. (A) Schematic illustration of robocasting equipment and (B) optical view of robocasting head, \nwhich deposits a concentrated colloidal suspension in a layer-by-layer build sequence to generate \n\ncomplex, three-dimensional parts.\n28 \n\n \n\nThe physical parameters that take place at the deposition of the ink through the \n\nnozzle are described by the following equation: \n29 \n\n                                                                      ?r=r ?P/2?                                                  (3)                                                                 \n\nwhere ?P is the pressure gradient applied along the nozzle length that provokes a \n\nradially varying shear stress (?r), r is the radial position within the nozzle (e.g. r=0 at \n\nthe centre axis and r=R at the nozzle wall). Plug or laminar flow may occur within the \n\nnozzle depending upon the velocity profile and the ink stability.\n29 \n\nIn recent years, different studies have been done remaining the fabrication of calcium \n\nphosphate scaffolds (HA, ?-TCP and BCP) by direct-write assembly.\n7,11,21,23\n\n The \n\nresults have been successful since it has been possible to produce scaffolds with \n\nrelatively complex architectures that were dried, sintered and characterized \n\nafterwards. This encourages researchers to continue working on this line.   \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           15 \n \n\nFor instance, P. Miranda et al. have studied the mechanical optimization of porous \n\nceramic scaffolds through the understanding and optimization of their macro- and \n\nmicro-structure.\n7,26,30 \n\nThis can be done with the aid of robocasting and the finite \n\nelement method (FEM). They have fabricated HA and?-TCP scaffolds consisting of a \n\n3D square mesh of interpenetrating rods and tested them under uniaxial compression \n\nat different directions. In Fig.6 are shown some scanning electron microscope (SEM) \n\nimages from one of the HA scaffolds. The ink used for robocasting had a final solid \n\ncontent of 35 vol%. Each layer from the CAD file consisted of parallel rods spaced \n\n400 \u00b5m from centre to centre. The rods from adjacent layers are orthogonal and the \n\nspacing between layers was set to 225 \u00b5m. The external dimensions of the scaffolds \n\nwere set about 10x10x10 mm so that a total of 44 layers were deposited.\n30\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Colloidal Processing \n\nThe term \u201ccolloid\u201d is used to define any particle that possesses at least one dimension \n\nin the size range 10\n?3\n\n?1 \u00b5m while dispersed in a liquid or gas phase. Colloidal \n\nsystems have a large contact area between particles and the dispersing medium.\n28 \n\nFor this reason, surface forces have a strong effect on the behaviour of the \n\nsuspension. Colloidal processing involves five different steps: 1) powder synthesis, 2) \n\nsuspension preparation, 3) consolidation into the desired component shape \n\n(robocasting), 4) removal of the solvent phase (water and additives), and 5) \n\ndensification (sintering) to produce the final microstructure required for optimal \n\nperformance. This last step may also help to get rid of unintentional heterogeneities \n\n(or defects) introduced at any stage of the fabrication process.\n 28\n\n \n\n2.5.1. Interparticle Forces \n\nDepending on the magnitude and nature of the interparticle forces, colloidal \n\nsuspensions can present a 1) dispersed, 2) weakly flocculated, or 3) strongly \n\nflocculated state. In the first state, the individual colloids are repelled when they \n\nnearly approach each other, having a repulsive barrier >>kbT. In the second state, \n\ncolloids are aggregated into a shallow secondary minimum with a well depth?2?20 \n\nkbT, having either the formation of isolated clusters (also called flocks) in suspension \n\nat lower volume fractions than the gel point (?<?gel) or a particle network  at higher \n\nvolume fractions (???gel).\n28\n\nWhen this happens, there is an equilibrium separation \n\ndistance between aggregated particles. On the other hand, in the coagulated or \n\nstrongly flocculated state, particles aggregated into a deep primary minimum, forming \n\neither discrete clusters or a touching particle network, depending on the concentration \n\nof the suspension.  \n\nThe stability of the suspension is controlled by the total interparticle potential energy, \n\nVtotal, which can be described as follows:\n 28\n\n \n\n                                      Vtotal = VvdW + Velec + Vsteric + Vstructural                                                       (4) \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           17 \n \n\nWhere VvdW is the attractive potential energy due to long-range van der Waals \n\ninteraction between particles, Velec the repulsive potential energy resulting from \n\nelectrostatic interactions between like/charged particle surfaces, Vsteric the repulsive \n\npotential energy resulting from steric interactions between particles surfaces coated \n\nwith adsorbed polymer species, and Vstructural  the potential energy resulting from the \n\npresence of nonadsorbed species in solution that may either increase or decrease \n\nsuspension stability (Fig.7).  \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

(For depletion forces, ? is approximately the depletant diameter)\n 28\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           18 \n \n\nThere are five ways to modify the Vtotal and consequently the stability of a colloidal \n\nsuspension by tailoring the different types of interparticle forces:\n 28\n\n \n\na) van der Waals forces:Long-range forces from vdW interactions are omnipresent \n\nand always attractive between similar particles. These can be mitigated within the \n\nsuspension until reaching the desired degree of stability. One approach is to \n\ncompletely diminish by suspending particles in and index-matched solvent. \n\nb) Electrostatic forces: In aqueous suspensions, the stability can be modified by \n\nproviding similar charges of sufficient magnitude on the colloids surfaces. As \n\npredicted by the DLVO theory, colloidal systems can become unstable when the ionic \n\nstrength is increased or the pH is adjusted toward the isoelectric point (IEP). \n\nHowever, it may be difficult to succeed generating stable dispersion based only on \n\nthis approach. There may be solubility concerns that limit the working pH range, also \n\nan extended double-layer thickness can cause unacceptable drying shrinkage. \n\nc) Steric forces: Organic particles that can be adsorbed by the colloids are often \n\nsupplied to the system to induce steric repulsion.This can be done in aqueous and \n\nnon-aqueous dispersions. The added particles may have different molecular \n\narchitectures such as homopolymers, diblock copolymers, comblike copolymers, and \n\nfunctionalized short chain dispersants.The density and thickness (?) of the adsorbed \n\nlayers should be enough to vanquish the vdW forces between particles and to prevent \n\nconnecting flocculation. In order to have steric interactions, the particles must \n\napproach each other at a separation distance less than twice the adlayer thickness. \n\nd)Electrosteric forces: polyelectrolyte species are widely used in colloidal \n\nsuspensions to achieved both steric and electrostatic stabilization. These additives \n\nhave at least one type of ionisable segment (e.g. carboxylic or sulfonic acid groups) \n\nand molecular architectures that include homopolymers, like poly(acrylic) acid, or \n\nblock copolymers with one or multiple ionisable groups. Adsorption of these species \n\nis strongly influencedby the physical and chemical features of the colloids surfaces \n\nand the solvent medium. For instance, if the surfaces of the targeted particles are \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           19 \n \n\noppositely charged with respect to the polyelectrolyte, then adsorption is strongly \n\nencouraged. At small adsorbed amounts, these additives can induce flocculation due \n\nto surface change neutralizations or bridging mechanisms. At higher adsorbed \n\namounts, colloid stability increases thanks to the long-range repulsive forces \n\ngenerated from electrosteric interactions. In Fig. 8, it is represented an example of \n\nmodifying the adsorption behaviour and conformation of polyelectrolyte additives by \n\ntailoring the solvent conditions (e.g. pH and ionic strength). Assignments of the vdW \n\nplane, the plane of charge (?0) and the steric interaction length (?) must be taken into \n\naccount when modelling the colloidal interactions. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

These can induce either flocculation or stabilization of the \n\nbigger particles. Depletion occurs with the presence of a negative depletant \n\nconcentration gradient near primary particles surfaces. This starts at a distance \n\ndefined as the depletion layer thickness which is related to the depletant diameter.

Suspension Rheology \n\nThe critical parameters that govern the rheological behaviour of a colloidal \n\nsuspension are the following: the apparent viscosity (?), the yield stress under shear \n\n(?y) and compression (Py), and the viscoelastic properties of the system such as the \n\nloss (G\u201d) and the elastic (G\u00b4) moduli. All of these can be tailored by the use of the \n\nalready discussed additives.\n28\n\n \n\nThe fabrication of CaP scaffolds by robocasting requires the use of highly \n\nconcentrated colloidal inks (???max) that can present excellent shape retention after \n\nthe forming the porous structure. It is important to understand the ideal flow behaviour \n\nrequired for the successful ejection of a strong enough filament from the nozzle. If the \n\nink is excessively fluid, it will have no trouble to flow out, however it won\u00b4t be able to \n\nretain its shape. In the opposite case, if the ink is overly viscous, if will struggle to flow \n\nout through the nozzle, and if it does there might occur rupture of the filament several \n\ntimes.  \n\nConcentrated inks usually present a viscoelastic behaviour that can be recognized \n\nafter performing dynamic rheological measurements (or oscillatory techniques). In this \n\ntype of characterization, a frequency dependant shear stress or strain must be \n\napplied to the colloidal system in order to obtain the complex shear modulus (G*), \n\nwhich has a real (elastic, G\u2019) and an imaginary (viscous, G\u201d) component  represented \n\nas follows:\n 28\n\n \n\n                                                              G* = G\u2019+ iG\u201d                                                  (5) \n\nWhere G\u2019= G* cos ?, G\u201d= G* sin ?, and ?is the phase angle. When a suspension is \n\npurely elastic (solid like), the applied strain and resulting stress are in phase (?=0), \n\nmeaning that the energy is completely stored. On the contrary, when a suspension is \n\npurely viscous (liquid like), the energy is completely dissipated, and the applied strain \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           21 \n \n\nand resultant stress are fully out of phase (??90\no\n). Thus, a viscoelastic behaviour (gel \n\nlike) should be at an intermediate range 0<?<90\no\n. \n\n3. Experimental Procedures \n\n3.1. Powder Preparation and Characterization \n\nThree types of HA powders with different compositions were prepared as raw \n\nmaterials for the colloidal suspensions. One of the powder compositions was \n\nprepared with pure HA while the other two compositions were doped with 5%Sr and \n\n10%Sr. The calculations for the preparation of the solutions used in the synthesis of \n\nthe powders had the following starting criteria (Ca+Sr) / P= 1.62. Assuming that the \n\ninitial concentration of the initial P solution was fixed at 1.2M, the concentrations for \n\nthe solutions of the other precursors were calculated in a way that maintained the \n\nstarting criteria, meaning that the total concentration of the precursors (Ca and Sr) \n\nwas 1.94M in the three cases. The quantities for the doping ions used for the \n\nsynthesis were 0.097M (5%Sr) and 0.194M (10%Sr). The three different powders \n\nwere prepared by chemical precipitation, starting from calcium nitrate 4-hydrate \n\n[Ca(NO3)2?4H2O] (Panreac Quimica S.A., Barcelona, Spain), di-ammonium hydrogen \n\nphosphate [(NH4)2HPO4] (Vaz Pereira-Portugal, Sintra, Portugal), and strontium \n\nnitrate [Sr(NO3)] (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), as chemical precursors for calcium, \n\nphosphorous and strontium respectively. \n\nFor each powder synthesis, two solutions (P, Ca or Ca+Sr) were prepared with \n\ndistilled water and predetermined concentrations, and then mixed homogenously \n\nusing a magnetic agitator at 500 rpm during a few minutes. After stirring, both \n\nsolutions were filtered through a 53 \u00b5m mesh to avoid contaminations and impurities. \n\nThe Ca solution was poured inside a reactor (previously heated up to 90 \no\nC) which \n\nwas closed afterwards, and agitation was set at 1000 rpm. Then the P solution was \n\npoured inside the reactor using a peristaltic pump (Heidolph Pumpdrive 5206) and the \n\nflux rate was set at 86.8 ml/min. Once the complete addition of both solutions in the \n\nreactor was finished, ammonium hydroxide (ca. 25%NH3, Sigma-Aldrich) was added \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           22 \n \n\nto the mixed solution in order to reach a pH=9 and maintain it. The precursors were \n\nlet inside the reactor during 2h after addition. At the end of this, the precipitated \n\nsuspension was removed from the reactor, filtered under vacuum to get the \n\nprecipitated powder, which was dried at 100\no\nC in an oven to remove the remaining \n\nsolvent. Then, it was deagglomerated and calcined at 1000\no\nC during 2h with a slope \n\nrate of 5\n o\n\nC/min. Some samples were calcined at lower temperatures (400, 600, 700, \n\n800, and 900\no\nC) for characterization purposes only. \n\n After calcinations, the powders were ball milled in dry state during 15+15+15min. \n\nSamples of the three raw powders along with calcined powders at all the mentioned \n\ntemperatures were subjected to X-ray characterization in order to  obtain information \n\nof their microstructures and phase changes. After ball milling, the particle size \n\ndistribution of the powders was analysed in a laser dispersion instrument (COULTER \n\nLS230, UK) using a Fraunhofer optical model.  \n\n3.2 Ink Preparation and Characterization \n\nThe preparation of the CaP ink for robocasting was performed at three different \n\nstages: 1) preparation of a concentrated suspension, 2) addition of a viscosifier agent, \n\nand finally 3) addition of a gelifying agent. The same powders with the three different \n\ncompositions (0%Sr, 5%Sr and 10%Sr) were used for this purpose. \n\n The additives employed for the ink preparation were the following: ammonium \n\npolycarbonate (Targon 1128, BK Ladenburg, Germany) as a dispersant in order to \n\nget highly concentrated CaP suspensions, polyvynilpyrrolidone (PVP K90, mol wt. \n\n~360 000, Sigma-Aldrich) and hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HMC, mol wt. 410 \n\n000, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as viscosifying agents, and polyethylenimine (PEI \n\n50% w/v in water, mol wt. 2000, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as gelifying agent.  \n\nIn a previous work, after comparing the ability of different dispersants for preparing \n\nhighly concentrated HA suspensions, Targon 1128 revealed to be the most efficient, \n\nenabling to achieve up to 50 vol% of solid loading.\n31\n\n It is an anionic-type dispersant \n\nthat helps to develop high zeta potentials in the neutral or alkaline pH region where \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           23 \n \n\nHA is thermodinamically stable, leading to an increase of the repulsive force among \n\nthe colloids. Targon\u2019s efficiency as dispersant and electrostatic stabilizer might be \n\nrelated to the composition of the functional groups along its polyelectrolyte chains.\n31\n\n  \n\nAlso calle hypromellose, HMC is an inert white to off-white powder that can be \n\nswelled in water to form a viscous colloidal solution. It can be an enteric film coating \n\nmaterial or a matrix binder in solid dosage forms. It is used as a viscosity control \n\nagent, gelling agent, film former, stabilizer, dispersant, lubricant, binder, emulsifier, \n\nand suspending agent. End applications include adhesives and glues, agriculture, \n\nbuilding materials, personal care products, detergents and surfactants, paints, printing \n\ninks, and coatings, pharmaceuticals, food products, polimerization and textiles. The \n\nviscosity of HMC 2% w/v varies within 50 to 50,000 cps. \n32 \n\nAlso known as polyvidone or povidone, PVP is a polymer that comes as highly cross-\n\nlinked flakes in its dry state.\n 33\n\n It was initially used as a blood plasma substitute and \n\nlater in a wide variety of applications in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics and industrial \n\nproduction.\n 34\n\n An important property of PVP is its solubility in water and other polar \n\nsolvents. Its ability to rise the viscosity of a suspension with increasing concentration \n\ndepends essentially on the molecular weight.\n33 \n\nIt has been used as a thickening agent \n\nin tooth whitening gels. \n\nBranched PEI is a cationic polymer which is liquid at room temperature, soluble in hot \n\nwater, cold water at low pH, methanol, and ethanol. It has been already used as a \n\nflocculant in order to gellify robocasting with good results. \n35 \n\nThe evaluation of the minimum quantity of dispersant to be added (1 wt% with respect \n\nto the powder), in order to obtain a well dispersed suspension, was done according to \n\nrheological measurements performed with a rheometer (C-VOR Bohlin Instruments, \n\nUSA). Suspensions with a solid content of 60 vol% were prepared by the mixture of \n\nthe right amount of water and dispersant, and the subsequent addition of the powders \n\nin small amounts, giving time for homogenization between each powder depositi on. \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           24 \n \n\nDuring this stage, the suspensions were agitated at 350 rpm using a stirrer (Ika Labor \n\nTechnik RW20n).\n \n\nIn the second stage, increasing concentrations of viscosifying (HMC, PVP, and \n\nHMC+PVP)  together with a fixed amount of water, were added into the previously \n\nprepared concentrated suspensions (60 vol%) and then characterized with the help of \n\na rheometer to get the right amount  to use which turn out to be 0.5 wt% with respect \n\nto the powder. After addition, the suspensions were placed in a container with small \n\nceramic balls, and then place between mixing rolls during 24 h to achieve good \n\nhomogenization. In consequence to the addition of water, the solid volume fraction \n\ndecreased to 55 vol%.  \n\nSimilarly, in the last stage of the ink preparation, the gelifying agent was added (along \n\nwith a certain amount of water) to the suspension on increasing amounts and mixed \n\nfirmly by hand with a spatula, until the desired gel consistency (similar to a tooth \n\npaste) was obtained, always performing the appropriate rheological measurements \n\nwith each amount. The solid content decreased to 50 vol% of CaP.  \n\nRheological tests were done at the viscommetry mode for the three stages of the ink \n\npreparation, and at the oscillatory mode (frequency sweep) only for the gelifying \n\nstage. For all the measurements, a cone-plate geometry (40mm diameter) was used \n\nwith a gap size of 150 ?m, temperature was set at 25\no\nC, and the samples were \n\nenclosed inside a metal ring cooled with di-ionized water in order to prevent \n\nevaporation of the suspensions during the tests.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           25 \n \n\n3.3. Fabrication of the scaffolds \n\nRobocasting of the inks was done at the University of Badajoz, in the Department of \n\nMaterials from the Faculty of Engineering. Three-dimensional periodic CaP scaffolds \n\nwere fabricated using a robotic deposition device (3-D Inks, Stillwater, OK), illustrated \n\nin Fig. 9. The inks were prepared as described previously with the only difference that \n\nthe homogenization, at the viscosifying and the gelifying stages, was performed \n\ninside a planetary centrifugal mixer (ARE-250, Thinky Corp., Tokyo, Japan) for a few \n\nminutes after each addition.Only PVP was used as viscosifying agent of these \n\nprocessed inks.  \n\nThe printing syringe was partially filled with the corresponding ink, tapped vigorously \n\nunder small vacuum to remove bubbles, and then placed on a 3-axis motion stage of \n\nthe robocasting device, controlled independently by a computer-aided direct write \n\nprogram (Robocad 3.0, 3-D Inks). \n\nIn order to know the printing limitations of the inks, they were deposited through \n\nconical (plastic) and cylindrical (metallic) nozzles with diameters of 410\u00b5m, 330\u00b5m \n\nand 250\u00b5m, at three different printing speeds 10mm/s, 15mm/s and 20mm/s. Several \n\narchitectures were consolidated using different computer 3-D models of the layers \n\nincluding the following features: squared, circular and triangular shapes, tetragonal \n\nand radial meshes, severalin-plane rod spacings (s), several layer spacings (h), \n\nseveral different external dimensions, and different numbers of printed layers. \n\nDeposition was done in a non-wetting oil bath to prevent non-uniform drying during \n\nassembly. The oil was removed manually using big pipettes and the samples were \n\ndried in air at room temperature for 24h and then at 400\no\nC (1\n\no\nC/min heating rate) for \n\n1h to remove the additives. Finally, the dried samples were sintered at 1200\n o\nC with a \n\nslope of 3\n o\nC/min during 2h.  \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           26 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.

A 3-axis robotic arm moves the injection syringe while pressing \n\nthe ceramic ink through the cylindrical deposition nozzles, immersed in an oil bath, to create a self -\nsupporting 3-D network of ceramic rods. Relevant dimensions of the scaffolds (rod diameter d, rod \n\nspacing s and layer height h) are indicated.\n30 \n\n4. Results and Discussion \n\n4.1 Particle size distribution \n\nThis parameter is of critical importance for the preparation of robocasting inks. The \n\nsmaller are the particles, the smaller will be their aggregates, having a smaller \n\nprobability that one of these might obstruct the nozzle. The particle size distributi on \n\nwas measured every time after the each ball milling step until obtaining results similar \n\nthe ones presented in Fig. 10 and Table 4. Having relatively wide distribution makes it \n\neasier to prepare a highly concentrated suspension, since better packing behaviour \n\nmight occur due to interparticle void filling of the smaller colloids can take place.\n11 \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           27 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

Volume Statistics (Arithmetic) of particle sizes from 10%Sr CaP powder.\n\n \n\n4.2. X-Ray diffraction characterization \n\nThe spectrums generated from the raw HA powders in the three compositions were \n\nvery similar between each other and to those obtained from calcined powders  at \n\n400\no\nC, 600\n\no\nC and 700\n\no\nC showing only the same crystalline HA phase. A first \n\nappearance of ?-TCP phase occurred at the spectrums from doped powders calcined \n\nat 800\no\nC, while the pure 0%Sr powder calcined at the same temperature had no \n\nsubstantial changes. These first ?-TCP peaks had higher intensity in the 10%Sr \n\npowder compositionn. At 900\no\nC the 0%Sr powder presented its first ?-TCP peaks, \n\nhaving a very similar spectrum than the 5%Sr powder that had no remarkable \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           28 \n \n\nchanges, while the 10%Sr powder continue developing its ?-TCP phase. At 1000\no\nC \n\nthe three compositions increased the number and intensity of their peaks, meaning \n\nthat they improve the crystallinity of both phases while the maximums where moved \n\nfrom the left side to the centre of the spectrum. After comparing all the \n\nmentionedXRD results, the influence of strontium on the enhancement of ?-TCP \n\nphase is more than evident.

Types of rheological behaviour exhibited by colloidal dispersions: (a) Newtonian flow; (b) \n\nshear thinning; (c) shear thickening; (d) Bingham plastic; and (e) pseudoplastic with a yield stress.\n28\n\n \n\nThe results from the rheological measurements performed on the viscometry mode to \n\nthe highly concentrated suspensions (60vol%of solid content) with increasing \n\ncontents of dispersant are shown in Fig. 13. If we compare the curves with those from \n\nFig.12, it is easy to identify that the suspensions present a pseudoplastic or shear-\n\nthinning behaviour, meaning that the viscosity decreases along with the shear rate, \n\nwhile the shear stress does the opposite.Increasing the amount of Targon from 0.5- \n\n1.0wt% induced adecrement in the viscosity of the suspensions, adding more than \n\nthis quantity leads to a raise of the viscosity. So, for the purpose of making highly \n\nconcentrated suspensions, the lowest viscosity must be achieved.  \n\nThe rheological parameters monitored at suspensions with 55vol% solid content, \n\n1wt% of dispersant and increasing quantities of HMC are presented in Fig.14. The \n\ncurves also present a shear thinning behaviour, although not so well defined as those \n\nin Fig.13. The more stable trajectory is presented with 0.5wt% of HMC, while the \n\nother three showed certain drops along the shear rate. Also, the consistency of the \n\nother three suspensions presented several lumps, thus when mixing with the gelifying \n\nagent, extremely aggregated pastes (unable to flow) were obtained. So the right \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           30 \n \n\namount in order to cause an ideal reaction in addition with PE was fixed at 0.5wt% for \n\nHMC, PVP and a mixture of HMC+PVP (0.25%+0.25%).  \n\n \n\nFigure 13.60vol% 0%Sr CaP suspensions with different concentrations of Targon (T) \n\n \n\nFigure 14.CaP suspensions 55vol% 0%Sr 1wt%T with increasing amounts of HMC. \n\nIn Fig. 15, logaritmic curves for the measurements performed with the fixed 0.5wt% \n\nquantity for the three viscosifying additives were compared in order to know their \n\neffects before the addition of the gelifying agent. The weakest of the three was PVP, \n\nfollowed by the mixture HMC-PVP although not in the middle range as it may be \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           31 \n \n\nthought, and finally HMC displays a substantial increase on the viscosity of the \n\nsuspensions.  \n\n \n\nFigure 15.Comparison of the viscosifying effect of HMC, PVP and HMC+PVP  \n\nThe effect of strontium on the flow behaviour of the robocasting inks can be inferred \n\nlooking at the profiles from Fig.16. With the same ammounts of additives in the \n\nsuspension (1wt%T, 0.5wt%PVP, 0.4wt%PEI), the 0%Sr suspension presents higher \n\nviscosity than both Sr doped inks along all the shear rate. The 5%Sr and 10Sr% inks \n\ntraced very similar trayectories that intersect each other several times.  \n\nThe graph in Fig. 17 shows the maximum added amounts of gelifying agent (PEI) \n\namong different combinations of suspensions tested. Obviously, the viscosifying \n\nadditive employed was PVP since it is the weakest and allows to add more gelifier. \n\nThe suspensions had 1wt% of Targon, 0.5wt%PVP and the following quantities of \n\nPEI: 0.4wt% for 0%Sr, 0.6wt%for 5%Sr, and 0.8wt% for 10%Sr. All the suspensions \n\npresented almost the same consistency at the time third stage of the ink preparation.  \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           32 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 16.Effect of the strontium content on the suspension behaviour \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

In \n\nFig. 18, the models for the three possible types of response that can be obtained from \n\nsuch tests are illustrated. A liquid-like response is observed when G\u201d>G\u2019 along the \n\nentire frequency spectrum, these vary as w and w\n2 \n\n, respectively, as w?0. A gellike \n\nresponse is observed when G\u2019and G\u201dvary as w\nj\n, where j = 0.3 \u2013 0.7, depending on the \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           33 \n \n\nsystem. A solid-like response is observed when G\u2019> G\u201dalong the frequency spectrum, \n\nwhere G\u2019is independent of frequency as w?0.\n28\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18.Schematic representation of oscillatory behaviour as a function of frequency for (A) liquid, \n\n(B) gel, and (C) solid response.\n28 \n\nOn Fig. 19 are shown the results from oscillatory sweeps performed at samples from \n\nthe three different compositions previous to the addition of the gelifying agent \n\n(0%PEI). The 0%Sr suspension presented a higher elastic response compared to \n\nthose obtained from the doped inks. Also, former shows a more pronounced rheo-\n\nviscosifying behaviour than the strontium compositions. This means that by \n\nincreasing the frequency (flow rate) the inks  present a more viscous consistence. For \n\nthe three different suspensions, the elastic modulus (G\u2019) stays relatively stable along \n\nthe frequency sweep, while the viscous modulus (G\u201d)  presents slopes which are \n\nmore tilted at frequencies below 1Hz. The previous statements confirm that the \n\nsuspensions present a solid-like response in all the oscillatory results. This is mainly \n\ndue to the high solid particles concentrations on the inks, higher than fifty volume \n\npercent. On the results from Fig. 20, the suspensions were added with 0.4wt% \n\namount of PEI. As expected, the three inks continue presenting a solid-like response \n\nbut at much higher scale, meaning that the valuesfor both modulus are substancially \n\nbigger, specially for the viscous one. Another change is that the elastic modulus \n\nshows slight slopes in the three cases. The0%Sr suspensions has a much greater \n\nrheo-viscosifying behaviour compared to the doped suspensions and to its previous \n\nresult with no PEI addition. The 10%Sr ink showed a higher viscous modulus during \n\nthe entire oscillatory frequency sweep. \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           34 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19.Oscillatory frequency sweep results from inks with no addition of PEI \n\n \n\nFigure 20. Oscillatory frequency sweep results from inks with 0.4wt% PEI \n\n4.4 Robocasting of scaffolds \n\nThe robotic depositions were performed using three different inks (0%Sr-55vol%-\n\n0.5wt%PVP-0.4wt%PEI, 5%Sr-50vol%-0.5wt%PVP-0.6wt%PEI, and 10%Sr-50vol%-\n\n0.5wt%PVP-0.8wt%PEI) and three different nozzle tips (red-conical-plastic-250\u00b5m, \n\norange-cylindrical-metallic-330\u00b5m, and blue-conical-plastic-410\u00b5m). The geometry \n\nand diameter of the nozzle tip is a critical factor that may cause failure of the ink \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           35 \n \n\ndeposition. For instance, only one sample was achieved to be successfully printed \n\nthrough the smaller red nozzle with the 0%Sr ink. It had a cubic architecture (1cm\n3\n) \n\nwith tetragonal mesh, outer support ring, rod diameter d=250\u00b5m, horizontal center to \n\ncenter spacing between rods s=500\u00b5m, vertical spacing between layers s=200\u00b5m.  \n\nThe main problem source seems to be the generation of bubbles within the inks, \n\nwhich are really difficult to remove, thus they are trapped in the syringe where they \n\nflow along with the ink until they get trapped at the nozzle because their superficial \n\ntension is higher than the injecting pressure of the deposition device. So when this \n\nhappens, either the process may be completely interrupted and the nozzle tip must be \n\nremoved, or the process may suffer a delay on the injection while the pressure is \n\novercome and the bubble extruded, but this causes a dramatic increase on the flow \n\nthus imperfections on the template. Issues of this kind where experienced when using \n\nthe orange nozzle, although in leaser degree than with the previous. The blue nozzle \n\nwas optimal since its relatively big diameter enabled the bubbles to be easily ejected \n\nwithout causing imperfections.  \n\nA total number of twenty samples were produce by robocasting, four pairs of identical \n\nscaffolds and sixteen with different characteristics (Table 5). The spanning features \n\nhad different shapes and sizes up to the range of a few milimiters of separation \n\nbetween rods. This is difficult to achieve and requires very good physical properties of \n\nthe ink, since flow is usually aided by the traction of the filament with the substrate or \n\nwith the underlying rods, so when this aid is absent the filament must have really \n\ngood characteristics in order to flow by itself and to maintain its shape without \n\nbending once it is linked.  \n\nThe picture on Fig. 21 shows the sixteen different types of scaffolds fabricated. \n\nSample 1 was done using a red nozzle (d=250\u00b5m), samples 4,5,7,8 and 9 were done \n\nusing an orange nozzle (d=330 \u00b5m). The remaining samples 2,3,6 and 10-16 were \n\nfabricated with a blue nozzle (d=410 \u00b5m). The scaffolds with squared layers have one \n\ncentimeter per side and different heights due to different number of printed layers. \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           36 \n \n\nSome of them may look the same but may differ either on having a supporting \n\nexternal ring or different ink composition. The cylindrical architectures have a \n\ndiameter of 1.5cm with internal holes diameters of 3mm and 6mm. The triangular \n\nscaffold has 1cm on the base and it is 1.8cm long. The shrinkage after sintering was \n\naround 15% compared to the initial volume for all the specimens.  \n\n \n\nTable 5.

At this temperature, all the powders presented a \n\nsecond CaP phase, beta-tricalcium phosphate. However, it was noticed through the \n\nXRD results that increasing the content of Sr enhances the development of ?-TCP \n\nphase. \n\nThe robocasting inks were prepared and tailored with the help of different additives \n\nsuch as dispersing agent (Targon), viscosifying agents (HMC and PVP), and gelifying \n\nor flocculating agent (PEI). The final solid content achieved on the suspensions was \n\nfifty volume percent (50vol%). Such inks presented a viscoeslastic behaviour on the \n\nrheometer, as well as a solid-liker rheo-viscosifying response on the oscillatory tests.  \n\nFinally, twenty scaffolds were successfully produced through the direct-writte \n\nassembly technique using different nozzle geometries (conical and cilindryical), \n\nmaterials (plastic and metallic) and tip diameters (250\u00b5m, 330\u00b5m and 410\u00b5m). \n\nRelatively complex architectures were successfully consolidated and maintained their \n\nshape after drying in air and upon sintering at 1200\no\nC. Considering the 50vol% water \n\nand organic content, the shrinkage after these two processes was less than the \n\nexpected, around 15% of the initial volume for all the architectures.  \n\nFurther work must be done in the near future to characterize the samples produce \n\nwith these CaP inks; for instance, performing mechanical and biological tests in order \n\nto have a better idea of thein-vivoperformance of these scaffolds. \n\n  \n\n\n\n                                            \n \n\nEuropean Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           39 \n \n\nReferences \n\n1.
