However, \ngeological events after the formation of the deposit (folds, faults, etc.) can change the \ndirection of spatial continuity of certain attributes, with the mixing of samples belong-\ning to different formation eras (in the case of stratiform deposits) in the same elevation. \nThis study presents a solution for deposits with stratigraphic grades combined with \nsamples of different origins. The solution is a two-dimensional estimate obtained by \naccumulating the thicknesses of P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n in a phosphate deposit (as compared to tradi-\n\ntional statistical analysis in three dimensions).\n\nKeywords: accumulation, ordinary kriging, phosphate.\n\nResumo\n\nA modelagem geol\u00f3gica de dep\u00f3sitos estratiformes pode-se tornar muito com-\nplexa, muitas vezes fazendo uso de envelopes geol\u00f3gicos de pequena espessura e \nexigindo o uso de sub-blocos (com base em coordenadas cartesianas) para produzir \num modelo de blocos coerente.

Introduction\n\nT he est i mate of a n at t ribute \n(grade, thickness, etc.) using geostatis-\ntical data requires certain assumptions, \nand among them is the assumption that \nthe attribute presents autocorrelation in \ntime and/or space. These estimates are \nbased on temporal/spatial continuity \nfor the attribute, which in turn is based \non the sample values of the attributed \nmodel. In many cases, the database \nis geo-positioned using a Cartesian \ncoordinate system. However, the con-\n\ntinuity of the phenomenon may not be \ncompatible with this type of coordinate. \nAt the time of formation of mineral de-\nposits, the minerals are crystallized or \ndeposited in positions consistent with \nan active geological process, and this \nprocess determines the continuity of at-\ntributes related to the constitution of the \nrocks (e.g. mineral grades). Geological \nevents subsequent to the formation of \nthe deposit, such as folding, can change \nthe direction of continuity of certain at-\n\ntributes (Koppe et al., 2006). There are \nsome ways around this issue, such as \ncoordinate transformations (McArthur, \n1987; Deutsch, 2002) and accumulation \nin two dimensions (2D) (Krige, 1981).\n\nIn cases where one dimension is \nmuch smaller than the others (stratiform \ndeposits), it is usual to use the accumula-\ntion method of grades by the layer thick-\nness, where the estimate of the grades is \nobtained indirectly. This process cannot \nbe considered a simplification because \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0370-44672014670179\n\n\n\n432\n\nThe efect of accumulation in 2D estimates in phosphatic ore\n\nREM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(4), 431-437, oct. dec. | 2014\n\nit adds complexity to the estimation \nprocess. Besides requiring additional \nsteps to obtain the final grades, it can \ngenerate inconsistencies if not executed \nproperly, with, for example, extreme \nvalues exceeding the minimum and \nmaximum grades of the original data. \n\nThis article aims to present the \nsteps in the estimation of a phosphatic \ndeposit (P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n) through the accumula-\n\ntion process in 2D, showing all the \nnecessary steps for its implementation. \nIn addition, the reasons for choosing \nto perform the estimation in 2D rather \nthan the conventional three dimensions \n\n(3D) are shown. The deposit studied \nhad several layers of phosphatic ore \ninterspersed with layers of waste rock. \n\nThe positions of the Highwall and \nthe Footwall were determined using \ndata from drillholes. The results of the \nmodeling showed almost horizontal \nlayers, with a slight folding, and large \nvariations in thickness\n\nThe determination of the spatial \ncontinuity of the deposit could be under-\nmined by mixing samples of the same \nlevel (elevation), Z, belonging to a dif-\nferent geological formation era (distinct \nstratigraphic levels), correlating samples \n\nthat may be on the Highwall in a drill-\nhole at one given Z coordinate and on \nthe Footwall in another drillhole at the \nsame Z coordinate, as shown in Figure \n2(a) (holes A, B, C and D). In view of \nthis, the unfolding (transformation of \nCartesian coordinates to stratigraphic \ncoordinates) of the deposit could be \na way of improving the results of the \nanalysis of spatial continuity, given \nthat in deposits of sedimentary origin, \nthe values from sediments of the same \ngeological age (stratigraphically on the \nsame horizon) tend to have high spatial \ncorrelation (Figure 1 (b)).\n\nFigure 1. Theoretical example of \nhow folds in the geological phenomenon \n(a) may affect the analysis of spatial \ncontinuity, and (b) how unfolding of \nthe layer can reduce the problem. It can \nbe noted in (a) that, independent of the \norientation of the ellipsoid search of \nsamples, those of the same geological \n\nera (1, 2 and 3) will be the same, if prop-\nerly analyzed. After the transformation \n(b), samples of the same geological era \n(1, 2 and 3) have the same orientation \nand coordinates in the search plan.\n\nFinally, in certain cases, the Eu-\nclidean distance is an inadequate mea-\nsure (as in the Figure 2) and should be \n\nreplaced by, for example, a \"curved\" \ndistance measurement in layers with \nfolds (Dagbert et al. 1984).\n\nTo determine whether the study \nshould be performed in 3D with sup-\nport, or in 2D, accumulating grades \nby the thickness, the series of tests pre-\nsented below were performed.\n\n2. Methodology\n\nThe sample data from a drill-\ning campaign were obtained from \nd r i l l  c o r e s  o f  d i f f e r e n t  l e n g t h s  \n(different bases). \n\nThese data from distinct bases \ncan be used for accurate geological \nmodeling, but to estimate grades (from \na statistical point of view) using them \nmay create bias in the results.\n\nThe database provided for geo-\n\nstatistical modeling had a total of 1643 \nsamples in the layer of interest. Because \nof the characteristics of the mineral \ndeposit, it was impossible to regularize \nthe bases of the samples, i.e. setting all \nthe samples to a constant length for \ngeostatistical analysis. In addition, the \ndatabase was composed of data from \nfour drilling campaigns, each with \nspecific goals and its own protocol for \n\nsample preparation, taking no account \nof a standard sample size, varying be-\ntween 0.1 and 2.12 m. \n\nThe bias created by the use of that \ndata unmodified is shown in Table 1, \nwhere data for a drillhole obtained by \nthe fourth drilling campaign is shown. \nNote that the layers adjoining the con-\ntact region show a small sample thick-\nness (some with high grade).\n\nFigure 2\nCross section of \ninterest layer (north\u2013south)\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\n-50\n\n-60\n\nE\nle\n\nva\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\nIsatis NE (m)\n\n(a) (b) Figure 1\n\n\n\n433\n\nDiego Machado Marques et al.\n\nREM: R.

Typically, such a com-\nposition is linear in nature, involving \ncalculation of a weighted mean of adjacent \nsamples uniformly over a greater length \nthan a single sample length (Sinclair and \n\nBlackwell, 2002). Some of the common \nreasons for sample regularization are: to \nprovide an equal basis (support) for geo-\nstatistical analysis, and reduce the number \nof extreme values and the variability that \nthese values may cause.\n\nThere are several different methods \nfor the regularization that can be used, \ndepending on the nature of the mineraliza-\ntion and type of mining process. Common \n\nregularization methods are: regularization \nby the height of the bench, regularization \nby constant length, and regularization by \nore zone. \n\nThe only method applicable (without \nbreaking the samples into smaller inter-\nvals) is the regularization method by ore \nzone. The result of this adjustment may \nbe seen in Figure 3, where each sample \nrepresents a drillhole.\n\nFigure 3\nHistogram of the length\n\n of the sample of interest\nafter the regularization by ore zone.\n\nAfter sampling regularization, it can \nbe seen that there is a great variability in \n\nthickness. Thus, a sample set does not ex-\nist on the same basis, preventing a study in \n\n3D without bias, as seen in the theoretical \nexample shown in Figure 4 and Table 2.\n\nFigure 4\nTheoretical example of \n\nregularization by ore zone.\n\nDrillhole Length of sample (m)\nGrade of \nsample \n\nP\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nTotal length \n(m)\n\nArithmetic \nmean of \ndrillhole \nP\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nWeighted \nmean of \ndrillhole \nP\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nRelative \nerror (%)\n\nFS4101\n\n0.1 14.2 1.87 12.3 19.9 38.3\n\n0.1 6.7\n\n0.1 9.8\n\n1.37 23.5\n\n0.1 9.5\n\n0.1 9.9\n\nTable 1\nExample of statistical bias created \n\nby using samples with different bases.\n\n\n\n434\n\nThe efect of accumulation in 2D estimates in phosphatic ore\n\nREM: R.

Accumulation\n\nThe regionalized variables (VRs) \nmust be such that all linear combina-\ntions of their values keep the same \nmean. If f(x) represents the grade of a \nsample, the sum of samples multiplied \nby their weight (in this example, the \nlength of the sample), ?i?i*f(xi), is the \narithmetic mean (1/n)*?if(xi), which \nmust have the same mean grade (Journel \nand Huijbregts, 1978).\n\nThe process of regularization en-\nsures that the sample regionalized vari-\n\nables have the same length and therefore \nthe same basis, which is necessary for the \nimplementation and use of geostatistical \nanalysis. But in some cases, this is not \nenough (e.g. chemical variables associ-\nated with particle size fractions) or not \napplicable (e.g. small, thick layers of ore). \nIn the case of a thin layer of iron ore, one \nusual method of estimation is the use of an \nauxiliary variable obtained by multiplying \nthe grade by the thickness (i.e. accumula-\ntion). The estimated grades are obtained \n\nindirectly by the relationship between the \nestimated cumulative variable and the esti-\nmated thickness. This practice stems from \nvariations in the basis (thickness) and the \nproblem of the non-additive nature of the \ncontent of the resulting variable (Marcotte \nand Boucher, 2001). \n\nAn accumulation process for trans-\nforming a set of 3D data to a 2D data set \nis divided into two steps. In the first step, \nfor each sample, the chemical variable is \nmultiplied by its length, as in Equation 1.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere:\n\u2022\t Zc\n\ni\n = accumulated sample value;\n\n\u2022\t Z\ni\n= grade of the sample;\n\n\u2022\t L\ni \n= length of the sample.\n\nIn the second step, the sum of the ac-\ncumulations is divided by the total length \n\nafter providing the weighted mean grade \nof the drillhole. At the end of the process, \n\nthere is a set of 2D data. A simple example \nillustrates the procedure \u2013 see Table 3.\n\nTable 3\nExample of the accumulation \nprocess used in this study.\n\nDrillhole Length of sample (m)\nGrade of \nsample of \nP\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nAccumu-\nlated grade \nof P\n\n2\nO\n\n5 \n(%) \n\nfor each \nsample\n\nTotal length \nof drillhole \n\n(m)\n\nAccumu-\nlated grade \nof drillhole \nP\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nWeight \nmean of \ndrillhole \nP\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nFS4101 0.1 14.2 1.42 1.87 37.21 19.9\n\n0.1 6.7 0.67\n\n0.1 9.8 0.98\n\n1.37 23.5 32.195\n\n0.1 9.5 0.95\n\n0.1 9.9 0.99\n\nZc\ni\n = Z\n\ni\n + L\n\ni \n               i= 1,2,...,n\n\nLength of \ndrillhole (m)\n\nGrade of \ndrillhole P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nArithmetic mean \nP\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nWeight mean \nP\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\nRelative error \nP\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (%)\n\n0.67 12 14.33 15.25 6.03\n\n0.67 13\n\n1.34 18\nTable 2\nSummary statistics for the theoretical \nexample of regularization by ore zone.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the mean \ncalculations ignoring the differences \n\nin basis between samples, and com-\npares them with results considering the \n\ngrades by thickness in the calculation of  \nthe mean.\n\nAccumulation creates a new set \nof 2D data, where each value repre-\n\nsents the grade of a drillhole from ac-\ncumulated survey data (multiplied by \n\nthe total thickness of the mineralized \nlayer).

Structural analysis\nThe analysis of the spatial charac-\n\nteristics (similarity patterns) of region-\nalized variables relating to a mineral \ndeposit is usually preceded by a criti-\ncal examination of the geology of the \ndeposit and a full analysis of the data. \nThere are several mathematical tools \n\nto measure the spatial continuity of a \nmineral deposit, including madograms, \ncovariograms, correlograms, etc. Stud-\nies of autocorrelation in geostatistics \nare often referred to as variography \nbecause of traditional emphasis on the \nvariogram or semivariogram (Sinclair \n\nand Blackwell, 2002).\nThere is a strong anisotropy in \n\nthe major directions of continuity (for \nboth variables), as can be seen in the \nFigure 6.

Statistical analyses \nwere performed with the accumulated data \nand the data was weighted. The weighted \ndata was used as reference for validation \nof the final results. For each survey, the \n\ncumulative variable was divided by the \nlength, resulting in a weighted average for \nthe survey. This weighted variable (as it \nwill be called from now on) is extremely \nimportant because it serves as a basis for the \nvalidation of the estimated model, as well \nas a reference for possible post-processing \nof the results (if necessary).\n\nThe layer of interest has 368 drill-\nholes with information on P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n.

Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(4), 431-437, oct. dec. | 2014\n\nTo estimate the accumulated P\n2\nO\n\n5\n \n\nvariable and the variable thickness, \nthe ordinary kriging method was used \n(Matheron, 1963). The estimation was \nperformed using a 2D block model. The \nblocks had X and Y dimensions of 50 m, \nand after the process of de-accumula-\ntion, had variable heights (Z-coordinates \nof the blocks in the geologic modeling \nprocedure). \n\nTo perform the estimation by \n\nordinary kriging, the search ellipsoid \nwas aligned with the variogram of the \ncorresponding variable. A minimum of \nsix and a maximum of 16 samples at a \ndistance of 3000\u20132000 m in N135 and \nN45 were required. The search ellipsoid \nwas divided into eight angular sectors. \nTo avoid problems of de-accumulation \nafter the estimates, it is important that \nthe search strategy of the accumulated \nvariable and the accumulator (in this \n\ncase, the thickness variable) is the same, \nand if necessary, the same variogram \nshould be used for the estimation. In \nthis case, it was possible to estimate \neach variable with its own variogram \nwithout further problems when mak-\ning the de-accumulation. Figure 7 (a) \nshows the results of estimation for the \nvariable thickness. Figure 7 (b) shows \nthe estimation results for the cumulative \nvariable P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 7\nLocation map with the results of the \nestimates for (a) variable thickness and (b) \naccumulated variable P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n.\n\nFor each block of the estimated \nlayer, the result of the accumulated vari-\nable P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n was divided by the estimated \n\nvalue of the thickness. The results are \nshown in Figure 14 (b). A quick com-\nparison of the measured variable P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n \n\n(Figure 8 (a)) and the de-accumulated \nvariable P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (Figure 8 (b)) shows a \n\ngood visual validation.\n\nFigure 8\nLocation map of the (a) weighted variable \nof P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n (data) and (b) variable de-accu-\n\nmulation of P\n2\nO\n\n5\n.\n\nBesides visual validation, a valida-\ntion of the global mean was undertaken. \nThe mean of the declustering weighted \ndata was 18.39% and the estimate gave \na result of 18.11% P\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n. Another way \n\nto validate the estimation is through \nthe analysis of derivation (Swath Plot). \n\nThe analysis derivation performs a local \nvalidation, where the average block is \ncompared with the average of the data \nin narrow bands in various directions \nof the block model. The validation was \nperformed in two directions: along the \neast (slices every 500 m) and along the \n\nnorth (slices every 500 m). The results \ncan be seen in Figure 9 (a) and (b). In \nthese figures, the red line represents the \nvalues read from ungrouped data by \n\u2018nearest neighbor\u2019 and the black line \nrepresents the values from the model \nobtained by kriging.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n4.3. Estimates\n\nImportantly, both variables show \nthe same directions of continuity, which \n\nwas expected. This does not mean that the \ndirection of major continuity of variable \n\nP\n2\nO\n\n5\n is the same as that presented in the cu-\n\nmulative variable, although it is very likely.\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n437\n\nDiego Machado Marques et al.\n\nREM: R.

The correction of the samples \nusing regularization is essential to \nthe practice of geostatistics, and the \nwrong choice of method can lead to \na significant bias in the estimates. As \ndemonstrated in this case study, the use \nof samples with different bases causes \nbias of the data mean. \n\nFurthermore, regardless of the \n\nadjustment of the sampling method, this \nbias can be propagated by spatial conti-\nnuity analysis, leading to inappropriate \ncalculation of the weights of the samples \nin the estimation process.\n\nAs the case study with a stratiform \ndeposit shows, with low thickness, there \nis the possibility of using unfolding tech-\nniques, a dynamic anisotropy search (in \nthe estimate) and/or sub-blocks.\n\nHowever, as no adequate basis \n\ncorrection method was found to permit \nanalysis of spatial continuity in 3D, \nthese methods were discarded.\n\nAlthough being an indirect es-\ntimation method, the analysis and \nestimation of spatial continuity of \nthe variables in 2D showed satis-\nfactory results.
