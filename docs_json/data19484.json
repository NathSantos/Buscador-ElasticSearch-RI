Therefore, I ask in advance, \n\nplease forgive me if your name is not cited in these next lines. Nevertheless, if you did \n\nanything, does not matter how small it was, to help me achieve the results exposed in this text, \n\nknow that I own you a life debt, even if I do not remember it. \n\nFirst of all, I want to thank FAPESP for the scholarships, under processes 2013/08736-\n\n6 and 2014/05738-0, that allowed this project to become true. \n\nSecondly, but not less, I would like to thank my family, my parents, Edison and Izabel, \n\nmy brother and sister, Ricardo and Erica, my sister in law, Maria, as well as my nephew and \n\nniece, Giacomo and Isabel, for soften  my life during such hard years. \n\nTo \u201colder\u201d friends of the Soil Science department, Osvaldo, Sueli, S\u00e2mala, Get\u00falio, \n\nLorena, Raul, Renata Beltz, Selene, Mariana and Laura, I thank the hours of discussion, \n\nwhere you were patient enough to hear much more than speak.  \n\nTo \u201cnewer\u201d friends, H\u00e9lio, Renato, Sara and Raquel, thanks for all the coffee hours. \n\nTo the whole class of 2005 from the best Unesp campus in the world, thank you for \n\nbeing part of my early career years, that prepared me for this moment. Special thanks to \n\nRufi\u00e3o and Salsicha, whom made my time in Piracicaba to look like it was just a continuation \n\nof my undergrad period. \n\nThanks to Erreinaldo and everybody at the LPV for allowing me to use their area for \n\nmy experimentation, and for giving me support every time that I needed. \n\nThanks to all the interns that helped me in all steps of my field and lab work: Julia, \n\nKatharina, Patrick, Marte, Felipe and Vitor. \n\nThanks to Dr. Alvaro Pires da Silva for letting me use his lab facilities, and to his crew, \n\nJair and Rossi, that helped me during part of my analysis. \n\nThanks to Sonia and Chiquinho for all the good work in the manufacturing of excellent \n\nimpregnated soil blocks, and for helping me at the lab whenever you could. \n\nThanks to Dr. Daniel Gimenez and Dr. Richard Heck, for all the learning and support \n\nduring my time in foreign lands.  \n\nThanks to Eliana for correcting this text, and everybody that work at the library from \n\nthe College of Agriculture, for all the help during my master\u2019s and doctorate. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n6 \n\nWe are coming to an end. Again, hope your name was cited here, if not, know that only \n\nfour names are in my mind now. I know what you are thinking - \u201cyou ungrateful b\u2026!\u201d. Well, \n\nget over it and let us continue. \n\nFirst, I would like to thank Virginia and Gonzalo for all the good moments. But \n\nespecial thanks must be given to Virginia. If you can see 12 beautiful and long tables along \n\nthis text, filled with the most interesting data about surface sealing and all that science stuff, is \n\nbecause she organized those tables. I have to say, is not every day that you have an intern with \n\na Master degree working for you. \n\nSecondly, I would like to thank Rodrigo Zenero. Without your work, there would be no \n\nthesis. Normally, we do not read about problems in the final work. However, I must declare \n\nthat, if in this world, demons and evil creatures are real, part of them must live inside \n\nelectrical devices. And a half of the population live inside our \u201cdear\u201d MicroRelief Meter. You \n\nshould be canonized for being able to make it finish my readings when I most needed it. \n\nThirdly, thanks to my advisor, Dr. Miguel Cooper. After four years, you have learned \n\nhow stubborn I can be. And, even so, during all this time you gave me your support and \n\nadvise. I cannot say that I changed, but I sure have matured during the time working with you. \n\nHope to continue our partnership in the years to come. \n\nAnd last, but not least. During the last years I am getting more and more certain that \n\nthere is no supreme being in the middle of the universe controlling our lives. No master in the \n\nuniverse. No after, just now. However, I cannot deny the faith of my parents, that, by holding \n\nthem up, it kept me strait on my path. At the same time, a dear friend of mine, already thanked \n\npreviously, gave me good moments of discussion about God, life and its mysteries, during \n\nthis last semester. The overall lesson that I take from it all, is that we born, live, and die, \n\nwithout knowing nothing for sure. Doubt, as logic, is the very essence of the human race. So, \n\nif I do not even know it for sure if multifractal parameters do really mean something, whom \n\nam I to deny the existence of something? Thus, in the name of my parents, I thank their God, \n\nwho, by making them happier in some way, made me a blessed man. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY \n

infer\u00eancias sobre seu comportamento. Par\u00e2metros \n\nquantitativos s\u00e3o comumente utilizados na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura e os multifractais ainda s\u00e3o \n\nsubutilizados na ci\u00eancia do solo. Alguns estudos mostraram rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre par\u00e2metros \n\nmultifractais com a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da rugosidade superficial do solo devido \u00e0 chuva e a \n\nheterogeneidade do sistema poroso. No entanto, uma assinatura multifractal relacionada a um \n\ncomportamento espec\u00edfico do solo ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1 estabelecida. Portanto, os objetivos desta \n\npesquisa foram: (i) relacionar par\u00e2metros multifractais com mudan\u00e7as na estrutura do solo por \n\nmeio da an\u00e1lise de mapas de rugosidade superficial e de imagens 2D provenientes de blocos \n\nimpregnados de solo; e (ii) utilizar estes par\u00e2metros para identificar as etapas de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo solo devido ao selamento e encrostamento superficial. Um experimento com chuva \n\nsimulada com intensidade de 120 mm h\n-1\n\n foi montado em uma Nitossolo Vermelho \n\neutrof\u00e9rrico argiloso em parcelas quadruplas onde aplicou-se volumes de 40, 80 e 120 mm, \n\nmais um controle sem-chuva. A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da rugosidade superficial foi avaliada em tr\u00eas \n\nescalas: um rugos\u00edmetro de campo (MRM) reuniu leituras numa grade fixa (10 x 10 mm, \n\n640000 mm\u00b2); um esc\u00e2ner com triangula\u00e7\u00e3o de lasers em multilinhas (MLT) foi usado em \n\nlaborat\u00f3rio, sobre blocos de solo, criando uma grade aleat\u00f3rio (0,5 mm de resolu\u00e7\u00e3o, 5625 \n\nmm\u00b2); um tom\u00f3grafo de raios-X (XRT) reuniu leituras de um bloco de solo em uma grade fixa \n\n(0,074 x 0,074 mm, de 900 mm\u00b2). Para a an\u00e1lise micromorfom\u00e9trica, amostras de solo \n\nindeformado (0,12 x 0,07 x 0,05 m) foram impregnadas, cortadas em blocos, polidas e \n\nsubdivididas em tr\u00eas camadas (0 a 10 mm, 20 a 30 mm e de 40 a 50 mm), paralelas \u00e0 \n\nsuperf\u00edcie, tendo cinco imagens (amplia\u00e7\u00e3o de 10x, 156,25 \u00b5m\n2\n pixel\n\n-1\n) geradas por camada. \n\nAp\u00f3s a segmenta\u00e7\u00e3o, tr\u00eas imagens foram selecionadas por camada e o sistema poroso foi \n\navaliado. An\u00e1lises de rugosidade n\u00e3o mostraram diferen\u00e7as (p > 0.10) entre par\u00e2metros \n\nmultifractais nas medi\u00e7\u00f5es da escala MRM, enquanto MLT e XRT puderam ser utilizadas \n\npara modelar a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da rugosidade com o aumento do volume de chuva. Como essas \n\nduas ultimas escalas apresentaram resultados similares, MLT poderia substituir o uso de XRT \n\nem tais an\u00e1lises, devido ao seu menor custo e possibilidade de cobrir \u00e1rea mais vasta durante \n\nas an\u00e1lises. O comportamento multifractal dos poros mudou de acordo com o \n\ndesenvolvimento do selamento superficial e da camada avaliada, sendo sensitivo a mudan\u00e7as \n\nno grau de fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o (n\u00famero de poros) dentro de cada classe de tamanho de poros. As \n\ndimens\u00f5es de Hausdorff a esquerda do espectro (Lf(?)min, L?f(?) and D2) tiveram rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nlinear com o aumento de volume de chuva para ambas medi\u00e7\u00f5es de rugosidade superficial do \n\nsolo e de \u00e1rea de poros. Entretanto, D2 n\u00e3o foi significativo (p > 0.10) entre volumes de chuva \n\npara diferenciar a porosidade pr\u00f3xima a superf\u00edcie, embora os par\u00e2metros D0-D1, D0-D2 e \n\nD1-D2 pudessem ser utilizados para descrever mudan\u00e7as nessa camada. Conclui-se que o \n\nespectro multifractal \u00e9 sens\u00edvel \u00e0 mudan\u00e7as estruturais no solo causadas pela chuva e que \n\npode ser utilizado na parametriza\u00e7\u00e3o da degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da rugosidade superficial do solo e da \n\nporosidade. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Eros\u00e3o pela \u00e1gua; Microrelevo; Escala; Sistema poroso \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n10 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n11 \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nQuantitative parameterization of soil surface structure with increasing rainfall volumes \n\n \n\nThe study of soil structure allows inferences on soil behavior. Quantitative parameters \n\nare oftentimes required to describe soil structure and the multifractal ones are still underused \n\nin soil science. Some studies have shown relations between the multifractal spectrum and both \n\nsoil surface roughness decay by rainfall and porous system heterogeneity, however, a \n\nparticular multifractal response to a specific soil behavior is not established yet. Therefore, the \n\nobjectives of this research were: (i) to establish relations between multifractal parameters and \n\nsoil structure changes by analyzing both soil surface roughness maps and 2D images from \n\nimpregnated soil blocks; and (ii) to utilize these parameters to evaluate soil surface \n\ndegradation by the processes of crusting and sealing. An experiment with simulated rainfall \n\nwas assembled on a Fine Rhodic Kandiudalf with an intensity of 120 mm h\n-1\n\n in quadruplicate \n\nplots at amounts of 40, 80, and 120 mm, plus a no-rainfall control. The evolution of the \n\nsurface roughness was evaluated in three scales of measurement: a field microrelief meter \n\n(MRM) gathered readings on a fixed grid (10 x 10 mm, 640,000 mm\u00b2); a multistripe laser \n\ntriangulation (MLT) scanner was used in the laboratory in soil blocks, creating a random \n\nmesh (0.5 mm of resolution, 5625 mm\u00b2); an X-ray tomography (XRT) scanner gathered \n\nreadings of a soil block on a fixed grid (0.074 x 0.074 mm, 900 mm\u00b2). For \n\nmicromorphometrical analysis, undisturbed soil samples (0.12 x 0.07 x 0.05 m) were \n\nimpregnated, sliced in blocks and polished. Each block was divided into three layers (0 to 10 \n\nmm, 20 to 30 mm and 40 to 50 mm), parallel to surface, and five images (10X magnification, \n\n156.25 \u00b5m\n2\n pixel\n\n-1\n) were taken by layer. After segmentation, three representative images were \n\nchosen by layer and the pore system was evaluated. Roughness analyzes showed no \n\ndifferences (p > 0.10) between multifractal parameters across rainfall amounts for MRM \n\nmeasurements, while both MLT and XRT could be used to model roughness degradation by \n\nrainfall increase. Since the last two scales presented similar results, MLT could replace XRT \n\nin such analysis, due to its lower cost and possibility of a larger area coverage. The \n\nmultifractal behavior of pores changed according to sealing development and depth of \n\nmeasurement, being sensitive to the changes on size distribution and fragmentation degree \n\n(number of pores) within each size class. The Hausdorff dimensions at the left side of the \n\nspectrum (Lf(?)min, L?f(?) and D2) showed a linear behavior with increasing rainfall amount, \n\nconsidering both soil surface roughness and area of pores measurements. However, D2 was \n\nnot different (p > 0.10) along rainfalls for the porosity closer to surface, although parameters \n\nD0-D1, D0-D2 and D1-D2 could be used to described the changes in this layer. Was \n\nconcluded that the multifractal spectrum is sensitive to structure changes caused by rainfall \n\nand that it can be used to parameterize both soil surface and pores degradation. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Water erosiom; Microtopography; Scale; Porous system \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n12 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n13 \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n\nThe description of the soil structure assists the understanding of its behavior in the \n\nenvironment, which is important to explain complex processes that occur in the soil, such as \n\nwater and air movement, nutrient cycling and erosion. However, characterization of the \n\nstructure must not depend only on its visual description if we want to logically describe the \n\nsystem. Particularly, to understand a physical process, a mathematical approach is very often \n\nthe most appropriate, because it uses a logical organization of thoughts to explain the system. \n\nAs a result, soil physicists rely on both mathematical and statistical modeling to describe \n\nprocesses in soil, and a range of indexes are used to characterize physical quality of a soil. \n\nIn the last century, several methods were used to estimate numerical data, which were \n\nused to express soil structure regarding its stability and functioning. These methods are \n\nmainly based on direct measurements of one or more soil physical attributes that, after some \n\nmathematical reasoning are linked to a determined behavior. For instance, aggregates size \n\ndistribution can be used to calculate the weighted mean diameter, which is commonly used to \n\ndescribe the stability of the soil structure. On the other side both pores size and shape \n\ndistribution are associated to several flux equations and used to model both inputs and outputs \n\nin soil, which basically governs soil functioning. The association between stability and \n\nfunctioning dictates the physical quality of a soil, that may be addressed in different ways. For \n\nexample, to achieve high crop productivity, the ideal relation between stability and \n\nfunctioning may not be the same as to the one to reduce erosion rates to a minimum. \n\nTherefore, the term soil physical quality can be ambiguous. This subject will be developed \n\nduring the section 2.1.2 to clarify the objectives and the methodology used during this \n\nresearch. \n\nNonetheless, since soil presents several functions on the ecosystem, which may lead to a \n\nrange of indexes used to characterize it, it may be considered as a complex system. This \n\nbrings up the importance of finding a parameter that relates to several soil attributes, allowing \n\nits interpretation in several areas of research. The fractal theory was broadly employed in the \n\nstudy of chaotic systems, such as turbulence, and in soil science it was used as a parameter to \n\ndescribe patterns of spatial distribution of different materials, from fungi and bacterial \n\ncommunities until scaling properties of soil aggregation, that interferes in both pores size and \n\nshape distribution. However, the range of interpretations that can be uniquely drawn from \n\nfractal results is very narrow. The main issue with interpretations only based in a fractal \n\napproach is to rely on a unique number so that it will describe several processes occurring at \n\nthe same time. Thus, the fractal dimension of a dataset is often correlated to other variables \n\n\n\n \n \n\n14 \n\nbefore conclusions can be made. In that sense, the multifractal approach allows more \n\nflexibility, as it will be scrutinized throughout this text, and a range of interpretations can be \n\nmade without the need of other variables input. However, its use is still incipient in soil \n\nscience. This fact may be associated to the multiplicity of parameters displayed by such \n\nanalysis, many of whom still lack physical interpretation. \n\nTherefore, the objectives of this research were: (i) to establish relations between \n\nmultifractal parameters and soil structure changes by analyzing both soil surface roughness \n\nmaps and 2D images from impregnated soil blocks; and (ii) to utilize these parameters to \n\nevaluate soil surface degradation by the processes of crusting and sealing. \n\nThe hypothesis tested were: i) The multifractal spectra is sensitive to structure changes \n\ncaused by a range of rainfall amounts; ii) some multifractal parameters can be used to model \n\nthe steps of soil surface degradation by rainfall. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n15 \n\n2 DEVELOPMENT \n\n2.1 Literature review \n\n2.1.1 Analyses of complex systems: soil as a multifractal \n\nA complex system is one that presents a challenge against universal modeling. In other \n\nwords, when it is difficult to find a suitable model to describe phenomena, because these \n\noccur in a system that has too many variables, we call this system complex (CHU, 2011). The \n\nfractal theory has aided the understanding of several complex systems where other \n\nmathematical approaches have shown to be laborious, or even erroneous. Because of that, a \n\nquick review of this theory is provided. \n\n \n\n2.1.1.1 Fractal theory \n\nIn Mathematics, the dimension of a space can be described as the minimum set of \n\ncoordinates to specify any points within it. The theory of measure, by Henri Labesgue, gives \n\nthe notion of linear measure on a straight line, of plane measure on a bi-dimensional plane, of \n\nvolume measure in three dimensional space (BESICOVITCH, 1928). Knowing that length \n\nexists not only in straight lines, but also in a space, Constantin Carath\u00e9odory defined the s-\n\ndimension of a set in a q-dimensional space as any integer number considering q   s. This \n\nstates the dimensions in a Euclidean space, which are always integer numbers \n\n(BESICOVITCH, 1928). \n\nWith the development of the set theory and Georg Cantor\u2019s idea of the existence of \n\nuncountable sets (an infinite of infinities), the Euclidean point of view, traced by general \n\ntopology, changed and mathematicians proved the possibility of non-integer dimensions. \n\nHausdorff (1919) using the axiomatic of set theory wrote a paper on his definitions of \n\ndimensions, and Besicovitch (1928, 1937) applied Hausdorff theorems on the description of \n\nsets of fractional dimensions. The definition is as follows, and can be similarly applied to \n\nhigher dimensional spaces: considering a finite sequence of sets Ui (U1,U2,\u2026,Un) that cover a \n\nset A (Ui   A) in a q-dimensional space (q equals a positive integer), and knowing di is the \n\nsequence (d1, d2,\u2026, dn) of the diameters of Ui, which di   ?, and ? is a positive number, the s-\n\ndimension of the measure A (s-dimA) can be defined as: \n\n          \n   \n\n   \n\n  \n\n  (1) \n\nIn a linear set Besicovitch assumed three possibilities: (i) there exists 0      1, if \n\n     for           and        for          , then A is a s-dimensional set; (ii) \n\nif          for any     , then A is one-dimensional; (ii) if          for any \n\n\n\n \n \n\n16 \n\n   , then A is 0-dimensional. This was called the Hausdorff dimension of a set and, due to \n\nthe possibility of fractional dimensions, was useful to describe the geometry of some strange \n\nsets. \n\nTo compute the dimension of an object is easier to calculate the Minkowski-Bouligand \n\ndimension, which is, in most occasions, similar to the Hausdorff dimension. A way to \n\ncalculate this is to cover the object with boxes with different side lengths L. The relation \n\nbetween L and the number of boxes N(L) that cover the object follows a power law \n\n      \n \n\n \n \n \n\n  (2) \n\nand, when L  , the boxes approximate the real shape and size of the object, \n\nexpressing Equation 3. \n\n        \n   \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n  (3) \n\nD is Minkowski-Bouligand dimension, also called the box-counting dimension, and   \n\nis a proportionality constant that represents the number of initiators of the object. This \n\nequation can also calculate the topological dimension of lines, squares and cubes, but nothing \n\nprevents D of being a non-integer number. \n\nIf the boxes are square, there is a scale relation when L decreases and a more \n\ninsightful way of writing Equation 3 is: \n\n  \n \n\n  \n      \n\n   \n  \n\n \n\n  \n \n  \n\n (4) \n\nWhere   \n \n\n  \n  is the number of boxes with size \n\n \n\n  \n, and    is the scale factor. When   is \n\n1, D can be expressed by using logarithm in Equation 5, where we can calculate D by two \n\nforms, approximately, by the slope of the log log plot of   \n \n\n  \n  vs  \n\n \n\n  \n , or exactly, by finding \n\nthe limit of this function. \n\n      \n   \n\n     \n \n  \n \n\n    \n \n  \n \n\n (5) \n\n2.1.1.2 Fractals in Nature \n\nAs stated before, the fractional dimension is not new in mathematics. However, its use \n\nto explain physical phenomena started only in 1967. By measuring the coast of several \n\ncountries and continents in different scales, Richardson (1961) showed that conventional \n\nmeasurement techniques could give enormously distinct results, with lengths increasing \n\nrapidly according to the magnification of the scale. Based on plots of scale vs length, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n17 \n\nRichardson saw a power law relation. Therefore, he used a log plotting to calculate the slopes \n\nof such relations and propose to use this parameter to distinguish the coastlines. \n\nMandelbrot (1967) made a mathematical interpretation of Richardson\u2019s measurements \n\nusing Equation 3 as basis, considering that the number N(d) of segments of length d needed to \n\nwalk across the coastline was proportional to (1/d)\nD\n, for some exponent D and a \n\nproportionality constant k (Equation 6).  \n\n         \n   \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n  (6) \n\nThe length L( ) of the coastline would be equal to the sum of all d: \n\n              (7) \n\nTherefore, by joining Equations 6 and 7: \n\n        \n   \n\n         (8) \n\nApplying logarithms: \n\n           \n   \n\n                   (9) \n\nIf the initiator is a unique line,    , and because its length would depend on the \n\nscale of measurement,   may be substituted by \n \n\n  \n, where    is a scale factor, generating \n\nEquation 10: \n\n        \n   \n\n     \n \n  \n \n\n    \n \n  \n \n\n (10) \n\nIf the data points of Richardson\u2019s log log plots lied along a straight line, the \n\nassumption on Equation 6 was justified, and Mandelbrot called the exponent D as the \u201cfractal \n\ndimension\u201d of the coastline, permitting Richardson's data to be interpreted by this value. This \n\nwas the first proof that, at some scales, natural systems could be represented by a simple \n\npower law that relates the characteristics of an object to an exponent, which was considered as \n\na dimension of the system. \n\nMandelbrot used the term \u201cfractal\u201d to designate the objects that exhibit repeating \n\npatterns at different scales and did extensive work on reviewing, theorizing and describing \n\nsuch objects and their relations with physical systems. Such interpretations were impacting in \n\nthe study of chaotic systems, since the fractal dimension helps to explain the scale relation of \n\ncomplex shapes, where details appear to contain more information than the general analysis of \n\nthe object. Therefore, the fractal theory defines spatial and temporal models of systems that \n\n\n\n \n \n\n18 \n\nexhibit a range of symmetry, characterized by a power law dependent on the number of \n\nrepetitions of a given characteristic. \n\n \n\n2.1.1.3 Multifractal theory \n\nAlthough the fractal theory presents an easy way of characterize a system, complex \n\nstructures of nature present variations that cannot be analyzed by a simple fractal model. In \n\nnature most of the processes are stochastic, and the mass distribution along the systems is not \n\nhomogeneous. The multifractal analysis includes this density variation, which are expressed \n\nin a multifractal spectrum (CHHABRA et al., 1989; CHHABRA; JENSEN, 1989) that gives a \n\nquantitative description of a heterogeneous phenomenon (STANLEY; MEAKIN, 1988). \n\nPerfect and Kay (1995) describes the fractal dimension as \u201ca non-integer dimension that \n\ndetermines the capacity of a generator in occupying a space\u201d and Stanley and Meakin (1988) \n\nsaid a \u201c\u2026multifractal phenomena describes the concept that different regions of an object \n\nhave different fractal properties\u201d. Therefore, the multifractal approach brings much more \n\ninformation of a process that happens at different scales, since it considers the heterogeneity \n\nof the system. \n\nIf a system presents areas of different densities, it means that at each step of its \n\nformation, different probabilities occurred at different regions. For example, in a volume of \n\nsoil, the formation of soil aggregates occurs at different amounts in each region, and areas \n\nwith higher concentration of solids are going to present morphology different to areas with \n\nhigher porosity. This shows that the distribution of probabilities of the mass along the object \n\ncan be used to describe the system and to interpret the system\u2019s organization. \n\nOnce again recurring to the counting-box technique, the mass probability of the ith \n\nbox       can be considered as the ratio between the number of points with mass of the ith \n\nbox       and the total mass of the system  . \n\n        \n     \n\n \n (11) \n\nSmaller the box size, smaller is the mass contained in that box compared to the rest of \n\nthe image. Therefore, there is a dependence between       and L, decreasing the probability \n\nof each box with the decreasing of L, which may be expressed by a power law. \n\n         \n   (12) \n\n   is called the Lipschitz-Holder exponent, or the strength of singularity (CHHABRA; \n\nJENSEN, 1989). This exponent characterizes the scale in the ith region or spatial location and \n\ncan be interpreted as the local behavior of       in the center of a box with diameter L \n\n\n\n \n \n\n19 \n\n(POSADAS et al., 2003). We can calculate   \n \nby Equation 10 and, because the probability \n\nmeasures the fraction of the points that occupy a region, we think of this ratio as a dimension. \n\n       \n   \n\n        \n\n      \n (13) \n\nBecause of a logarithm property, smaller probabilities gives higher values of   , being \n\nthe contrary true. Since    turns into a local exponent when    , and similar values can be \n\nfound in different regions (boxes) of the system, the measure is called a \u201cmultifractal\u201d \n\n(PARISI et al., 1985), exhibiting a range of power laws (Equation 11). \n\n        \n \n\n \n \n    \n\n (14) \n\nThe number of boxes      where       has exponents      is proportional to the \n\ninverse of the box size   and to an exponent f(?), which is the Hausdorff dimension of a set of \n\nboxes having the same strength singularity and can be loosely defined as a set of \"fractal \n\ndimensions\". Plotting f(?) vs ? we obtain a parabolic curve, with concavity up, known as the \n\nsingularity spectrum, or the multifractal spectrum of the object. As cited by Chhabra and \n\nJensen (1989) this curve \u201c\u2026provides us with a precise mathematical description of the \n\nmultifractal behavior of a data set of an object\u201d. \n\nDue to difficulties in direct computation of f(?), various methods where proposed to \n\nobtain it. Two main methods will be described here: the Legendre transformation of the ?(q) \n\ncurve and the use of partition function        . \n\n \n\n2.1.1.3.1 Legendre transformation of ?(q) \n\nFrom Equation 11 is possible to note a conservation of probability: \n\n      \n\n \n\n   \n\n   (15) \n\nRearranging Equations 11 and 15, and adding a distortion exponent   to evaluate the \n\nbehavior of the distribution of mass in the measure, we get to the Equation 16 (BENZI et al., \n\n1984): \n\n      \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n  \n      \n\n \n   \n\n \n\n \n (16) \n\nWe note that the distortion depends on the L size of the box, and it follows a power \n\nlaw (MANDELBROT, 1974; HENTSCHEL; PROCACCIA, 1983; BENZI et al., 1984):  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n20 \n\n      \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n        (18) \n\nWhere      is a non-linear function of   if the fractal is not uniform, i.e. in the case of \n\na multifractal measure, and it relates to an infinite number of generalized dimensions    as \n\nshowed by Hentschel and Procaccia (1983): \n\n             (19) \n\nJoining Equations 19 and 18, applying logarithms and limit, so    , we get the \n\ndefinition of the generalized dimensions used by Hentschel and Procaccia (1983): \n\n   \n \n\n   \n   \n   \n\n          \n     \n\n   \n\n    \n (20) \n\nThe slope of the curve           is  :  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n (21) \n\nAnd due to the non-linearity of      there exists a range of    from which there are \n\nequivalent intercepts       (  =1,2,\u2026,N): \n\n            (22) \n\nThus, using the Legendre transformations of the           curve is possible to get an \n\n          spectrum. \n\n \n\n2.1.1.3.2 Partition function           \n\nChhabra and Jensen (1989) proposed a direct method to determine the      spectrum, \n\nwithout recurring to the Legendre transformations. For this, they used the comparison of the \n\ndistortion of the mass probabilities over the sum of all boxes at this size (Equation 23). \n\n        \n  \n \n\n  \n \n     \n\n   \n\n (23) \n\nUsing a relationship between the Hausdorff dimension and Shannon\u2019s entropy, \n\nEquation 22 can generate Equations 24 and 25. \n\n        \n   \n\n                     \n    \n   \n\n    \n (24) \n\n \n\n        \n   \n\n                   \n    \n   \n\n    \n (25) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n21 \n\nConsidering the intervals where the linear correlation between the numerators of \n\nequations 23 and 24 vs      is high, we can estimate the f(?) spectrum. \n\n \n\n2.1.1.3.3 Multifractal spectrum parameters \n\nThe f(?) spectra presents a convex parabolic shape, from where several parameters are \n\nknown (Figure 1). The maximum Hausdorff dimension (f(?)max) occurs at q = 0 and it is \n\nknown as the capacity or the box counting fractal dimension (D0), representing the global \n\ninformation or system average (VOSS, 1988). When the Hausdorff dimension equalizes the \n\nLipschitz-Holder exponent (f(?) = ?), q is 1 and this is called the entropy dimension (D1), \n\nsince is related to the Shannon entropy (SHANNON; WEAVER, 1949). When q is 2, f(?) is \n\nmathematically associated with the correlation function (HENTSCHEL; PROCACCIA, 1983) \n\nand represents the correlation of the measures contained in a L size box, being called \n\ncorrelation dimension (D2). If a process is indeed multifractal, these sorts as D2 ? D1 ? D0 \n\n(HENTSCHEL; PROCACCIA, 1983). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Schematic of a multifractal spectrum and graphical interpretations of the capacity dimension (f(?)max \n\n=D0) and the entropy dimension (f(?)?? =D1). \n\n \n\n \n\nOther parameters can be assessed from the spectrum and their physical interpretation \n\nmay help describe soil structure changes (Figure 2). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n22 \n\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 Schematic of a multifractal spectrum and parameters that can be estimated: Rf(?)min: minimum \n\nHausdorff dimension at right of D0; Lf(?)min: minimum Hausdorff dimension at left of D0; ?Rf(?): \n\nrange of Hausdorff dimensions at right of D0; ?Lf(?): range of Hausdorff dimensions at left of D0; \n\nf(?)ratio: ratio between ?Rf(?) and ?Lf(?); ?min: minimum Lipschitz-Holder exponent; ?max: maximum \n\nLipschitz-Holder exponent; ??: the complete range of Lipschitz-Holder exponents; ?R?: range of \n\nLipschitz-Holder exponents at right of D0; ?L?: range of Lipschitz-Holder exponents at left of D0; \n\n?ratio: ratio between ?R? and ?L? \n\n \n\nThe minimum Hausdorff dimension at left of D0 (Lf(?)min) is related to positive range of \n\nq\u2019s, so it can be interpreted as the fractal dimension of areas presenting higher probabilities. \n\nThe range between D0 and the Lf(?)min (?Lf(?)) represents how uniform the fragmentation \n\nprocess occurs at areas with higher probabilities, and values closer to 0 may show a \n\nhomogeneous process, or one dominated by smaller probabilities. Similarly, the minimum \n\nHausdorff dimension at right of D0 (Rf(?)min) represents the fractal dimensions of areas with \n\nsmaller probabilities, and the range between this and D0 (?Rf(?)) shows the diversity of \n\ndimensions of these areas. While the ordinate axe relates to the fragmentation process at \n\ndifferent ranges of probabilities, the Lipschitz-Holder exponent (?) shows how probabilities \n\nchange along scales. Thus, its minimum (?min) shows how the distribution changes over scale \n\nin areas of higher density, and its maximum (?max) how it happens for the areas with lower \n\ndensity. The range at left and at right of ?(D0) (?L? and ?R?) indicate which class changes \n\nmore over scale when compared to the systems\u2019 mean. The whole range (??) represents how \n\ndiverse the system is along scales. Both ratios (f(?)ratio and ?ratio) relates the behavior of areas \n\nwith small probabilities to those with high probabilities, and show which class is more \n\n\n\n \n \n\n23 \n\nfragmented and changes more across scale, respectively. They are calculated according to \n\nEquations 26 and 27. \n\n           \n      \n\n      \n (26) \n\n \n\n       \n   \n\n   \n (27) \n\n \n\n2.1.1.4 Fractal and multifractal applications in soil science \n\nFractal techniques have been used in soil science as an alternative to conventional \n\ngeometry (PACHEPSKY et al., 1996; GIMENEZ et al., 1997). The fractal dimension \n\nassumes that a soil property is scale dependent and can be represented by a power law. In soil \n\nbiology it was used in evaluation of mycelial morphology of different fungi species (BODDY \n\net al, 1999). In the soil chemistry area, Rice and Lin (1993) were the first to evaluate the \n\nfractal nature of humic materials, followed by Senesi (1999), Rizzi et al. (2004) and Fedotov \n\nand Shoba (2013). Also Rice et al. (1999) and Sokolowska et al. (2009) considered patterns of \n\nthe distribution of soil organic matter. Fractal dimensions were also used in many other areas \n\nof soil chemistry, e.g., as a parameter to estimate cation exchange capacity (ERSAHIN et al., \n\n2006; BAYAT et al., 2014), to evaluate mineral dissolution (GUARRACINO et al., 2013), \n\nnitrogen adsorption isotherms (PAZ FERREIRO; WILSON; VIDAL V\u00c1ZQUEZ, 2009), soil \n\nmetal contamination (GERANIAN; MOKHTARI; COHEN, 2013), amongst others. \n\nThe field of soil physics is where the use of fractal analysis started, and, because of that, \n\nis the area with most vast use for such theory. It started in the analysis of soil particles \n\ndistribution (ORFORD; WHALLEY, 1983), and have been widely used until today for the \n\nsame purpose (TYLER; WHEATCRAFT, 1992; STANCHI et al, 2006, BIEGANOWSKI et \n\nal., 2013; PENG et al., 2014). In the analysis of the structure Turcotte\u2019s (1986) paper on soil \n\nfragmentation was a pioneer, while publications by Young and Crawford (1991), and \n\nCrawford, Sleeman and Young (1993), are the classical base for fractal modeling of \n\naggregates size distribution. In the field of pore analysis its use was really expanded, \n\nespecially considering the image analysis of soil pore systems. The first work considering the \n\npore system was the one from Rieu; Sposito (1991), and was followed for more than 30 \n\npublications on the same subject, considering methodological problems and specific \n\napplications. There are several review papers about fractal under the structure scope. \n\nGhanbarian-Alavijeh et al. (2011) reviewed the pore-solid-fractal approach; Perfect and Kay \n\n\n\n \n \n\n24 \n\n(1995) the applications in soil and tillage researchs. All things considered, the fractal theory \n\nwas, and still have been, well explored in soil science. \n\nHowever, the fractal approach characterizes the mean properties of a dataset and cannot \n\nprovide information on average behavior deviations of a power law (POSADAS et al., 2003). \n\nThe multifractal analysis includes density variations and can be expressed in a multifractal \n\nspectrum (CHHABRA et al., 1989; CHHABRA; JENSEN, 1989), which integrates and \n\nquantifies the spatial properties of the studied object (POSADAS et al., 2003). The \n\nmultifractal tool is much newer if compared to the fractal approach, especially applied to the \n\nsoil science field. For example, during the literature review for this research, it was found 10 \n\npapers which used multifractal analysis for particle size distribution, 4 in the analysis of soil \n\nstructure and 21 considering the pore system, being 5 about water retention modeling. The \n\nrespective number of papers considering the fractal applications were 19, 46, 27 and 45. \n\nSome parameters of the multifractal spectrum are well known and related to the \n\nheterogeneity of the porous system (POSADAS et al., 2003). However, due to its still \n\nincipient use in soil science, soil properties leading to a multifractal behavior are not \n\nestablished yet, which makes the interpretation of soil multifractal parameters an important \n\nsubject of investigation. \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Definition of soil physical quality \u2013 stability and functioning \n\nThe description of any system demands the creation of an ordered list of parameters \n\nwith specific definitions that allows us to explain each step of the phenomena occurring in \n\nsuch system. Let us take as example the term \u201csoil science\u201d. Before knowing its significance, \n\nit is necessary to define separately what is \u201csoil\u201d and what is \u201cscience\u201d. Soil (from Latin \n\nsolum, Anglo-French soy and Middle-English soile, meaning \u201cground\u201d) can be defined as a \n\ntriphasic (consisting of air, liquids and solids) and tridimensional body that occupies the \n\nEarth\u2019s surface. It is bordered by the atmosphere above, the lithosphere below and by water \n\nbodies laterally (i.e. lakes, rivers, seas and oceans) and beholds life. Its genesis arises from the \n\ninteraction between a parental material with climate and organisms over time, being affected \n\nby the relief. Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \"knowledge\") is a systematic enterprise \n\nthat builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions \n\nabout the universe. Science is also associated with the scientific method itself, which the \n\nOxford English Dictionary (2015) defines as \"a method or procedure \u2026 consisting in \n\nsystematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and \n\nmodification of hypotheses\". Thus, \u201csoil science\u201d can now be defined as a systematic \n\n\n\n \n \n\n25 \n\norganization of the knowledge achieved of the subject \u201csoil\u201d by experimentation. It is \n\ndeveloped by the study of soil as a natural resource of the surface of the Earth, based on the \n\ndescription of its genesis, classification and mapping, using physical, chemical and biological \n\nattributes, and aiming to enhance its use, management and conservation. \n\nAlthough very broad, we can follow the same premise to define \u201csoil physical \n\nquality\u201d. Is important to state that the aim of this work is not to create a global definition for \n\nthis term, but the reader needs to understand our scope when referring to it during this text. A \n\nbrief comment on the definition of soil structure is needed. As stated before, soil is triphasic. \n\nHow the three phases interact forming different arrangements between solids and pores (i.e. \n\nthe spaces not occupied by solids that can be filled up by liquid or air) is defined as \u201csoil \n\nstructure\u201d. \n\n\u201cSoil quality\u201d can be defined as \u201cthe ability of a soil to perform functions that are \n\nessential to people and the environment\u201d (DORAN et al., 1994). Since soil structure affects \n\nwater and air movement, influencing its ability to execute vital functions, and all of the above \n\nare physical processes occurring in soil, the term \u201csoil physical quality\u201d will be considered in \n\nthis text as a measure of the ability that soil structure has to perform functions that are \n\nessential to mankind and the environment. Thus, a soil with good physical quality presents a \n\nsoil matrix resistant to disaggregation, at the same time allowing life to exist. In other words, \n\na soil with high physical quality must be resistant to erosion and exhibit a degree of \n\norganization that allows the development of flora and fauna. \n\nAll classical soil physical properties (texture, bulk density, aggregates shape and size) \n\nallow inferences about soil physical quality, because they all relate to the matrix arrangement. \n\nHowever, it is common to find that most publications on soil physical quality are associated to \n\nsome physical index, in an attempt to resume several soil attributes into fewer variables. Such \n\nindex may be linked to properties that command crop development, like compaction and \n\nresistance to penetration. Some examples are the aggregates tensile resistance (DEXTER; \n\nKROESBERGEN, 1985; MULLINS et al., 1992), relative bulk density (H\u00c5KANSSON, \n\n1990) and the least limiting water range (SEVERIANO et al., 2011). On the other hand, soil \n\nstructural stability, which is a measure of how soil structure maintains its coherence over \n\ntime, is also an important physical qualifier. In this case, clay dispersion (LEVY et al., 1993) \n\nand distinct measures of aggregates stability (Le BISSONNAIS, 1996) are widely used to \n\nproduce indexes, since they show how soil behaves against erosion. \n\nWe can consider the soil functioning as the third pillar of soil physical quality. The term \n\n\u201cfunction\u201d relates to how the soil plays its role in the ecosystem. Then, its \u201cfunctioning\u201d is \n\n\n\n \n \n\n26 \n\nany process that leads to this end. The main physical processes in soil are modeled via flux \n\nequations. These are used to model water (RAATS, 2001) and air (MOLDRUP et al., 2001) \n\nmovement in soil. In that way, properties that represent these processes are also indicative of \n\nthe degree of physical quality of a soil. Examples are the use of the classical water retention \n\ncurve (DEXTER, 2004a, 2004b), the surface water infiltration rate (ZHOU; LIN; WHITE, \n\n2008), the air permeability (BALL et al., 1997), hydraulic conductivity (PAGLIAI; \n\nVIGNOZZI; PELLEGRINI, 2004), amongst others. Some of these will be explored in this \n\ntext. \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Soil erosion: its mechanic and the \u201csealing\u201d process \n\nSoil erosion is a set of natural processes that changes a soil, diminishing its capability \n\non exercising its function in the ecosystem. These processes cause physical, chemical and \n\nbiological changes. They are marked by: the selective removal of particles, which changes the \n\nstructure, interfering in the dynamics of fluids and heat; the decline in the content of organic \n\nmatter and nutrients, causing decay in soil fertility; and, as a result, a reduction in the biota. \n\nHuman accelerated erosion is a major cause of cultivable soils depletion, making them \n\nunsuitable for exploitation. To change this feature, several soil conservation techniques are \n\nused to reduce erosion to a minimum rate. These techniques are the result of extensive \n\nresearch on the causes of erosion, which are explained by the mechanics of the erosion \n\nprocess, that relates the soil and the erosive agents. \n\n \n\n2.1.3.1 Physical Erosion \n\nIt is common to divide erosion into physical, chemical and biological, according to its \n\ncause (LAL, 2001). The physical erosion is the process in which a natural agent causes the \n\nbreakdown, transport and deposition of soil particles and aggregates (MORGAN, 2005). \n\nDuring this text we will only discuss this type of erosion and address it simply by \u201csoil \n\nerosion\u201d. \n\nThe natural agents cited above are any force of nature capable of implementing \n\nsufficient energy to detach soil particles and aggregates, and move them, until they deposit at \n\na location different from its origin. Wind and water are those agents, but they may be assisted \n\nby fire (SHAKESBY, 2011; GABET, 2014), since fire weakness the structure, and gravity as \n\nsupporter agents (LAL, 2001). However, wind or water are still needed to detach and carry \n\nthe soil to a lower gravitational reference (e.g. point closer to earth\u2019s center). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n27 \n\nIn the case of water, erosion may occur due to its performance in liquid form, through \n\nthe action of rainfall, rivers and sea waves (LAL, 2001), or in solid form, due to expansive \n\naction of water during the condensation process, or to the melting that destabilizes the \n\nstructure (ANDERSLAND; WIGGERT; DAVIES, 1996). In tropical regions, which \n\nrepresents a major area of Brazil, the main erosion agent is rainwater, since summer \n\nrainstorms are very common in such climate. The rainfall is primarily responsible for the \n\nerosion in places where the soil bares unprotected, due to tillage operations, and prone to \n\ncrumbling. \n\n \n\n2.1.3.1.1 Mechanics of erosion caused by rainfall \n\n2.1.3.1.1.1 Rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility \n\nConsidering rainfall itself, several attributes interfere in its \u201cerosivity\u201d, i.e. its capacity \n\nin causing erosion (WISCHMEIER; SMITH, 1960; SALLES; POESEN; GOVERS, 2000). \n\nWe can summarize the main attributes as: the raindrop size (UIJLENHOET; STRICKER, \n\n1999), pressure exerted over the soil (NEARING; PARKER, 1994) and velocity when \n\nreaching the target (GUO et al., 2013); the rainfall intensity (ASSOULINE; BEN-HUR, 2006) \n\nand amount (DALLA ROSA et al., 2012); and the composition of the rainwater (BORSELLI \n\net al., 2001). Most studies on soil erosion process keep one or two of these attributes as \n\nvariables, while maintaining all others constant. In studies with simulated rainfall, the \n\nraindrop size, velocity, pressure and angle of contact can be controlled by the devices sets. \n\nThen, is left to the researcher to decide on the intensity and amount to be used during \n\nexperimentation.  \n\nOnce rainfall impacts on soil surface, the erosion starts to be controlled by its intrinsic \n\nproperties, such as: soil type and steepness, that are dependent on the parental material, \n\nregional climate and landform (WISCHMEIER; MANNERING, 1969); tillage and cover, \n\nfactors that are controlled by man (i.e. land use) (DALLA ROSA et al., 2012). Once again, \n\nthese are attributes that can be controlled or evaluated separately, to comprehend their \n\nrelationship with erosion rates (VAN OOST; GOVERS; DESMET, 2000; LAL, 2001).  \n\nRainfall erosion begins with the impact of raindrops over the soil surface (NEARING; \n\nBRADFORD; HOLTZ, 1987), continues through disintegration of clods and aggregates (Les \n\nBISSONNAIS, 1996), extends up to the runoff (NEARING; PARKER, 1994) and it ends with \n\nthe sedimentation. Part of the sediments formed during the rainfall event are carried along \n\nwith the water to the watercourses and are deposited in the lower parts of the relief (e.g. \n\nriparian zones). However, part of these particles and aggregates can also settle very close to \n\n\n\n \n \n\n28 \n\nits origin, causing local changes in soil surface structure by forming a \u201cseal\u201d. Since the whole \n\nerosion process consists of these three main steps (particles and aggregates detachment, runoff \n\nand sedimentation) this will be further discussed. \n\n \n\n2.1.3.1.1.2 Particles and aggregates detachment and transport \n\nThe detachment of the particles is the first stage of the erosion process and occurs \n\nmainly by three causes: the raindrop impact, which releases its kinetic energy on the soil \n\nsurface, breaking aggregates and clods where the structure has weak points, and spreading \n\nparticles around; slaking, due to rapid moistening, that increases aggregates internal pressure, \n\ncausing micro-implosions that create ruptures that induce crumbing; and by water induced \n\nstructure weakness, since water acts as a lubricant that allow structural sliding when soil is \n\nsaturated (Les BISSONNAIS, 1996).  \n\nThe second stage of erosion is the transport of aggregates and particles. It starts with the \n\nspreading caused by the impact of the raindrop, and continues when water starts to flow in \n\nsurface, carrying sediments downhill (MORGAN, 2005). Water surface flow only happens if \n\nrainfall intensity exceeds soil hydraulic conductivity capacity (DARBOUX et al., 2001). To \n\nbe transported, the sediment must be detached from the soil matrix (SHARMA, 1996), and \n\nthe rate and distance is dependent on the energy of the water flux at surface (DARBOUX at \n\nal., 2001), which is dependent on the steepness (NEARING; PARKER, 1994) and roughness \n\nof the surface (DARBOUX; HUANG, 2005). During the superficial flux of particles, i.e. the \n\nrunoff, more particles can be detached and transported, depending on the shear capacity of the \n\nflux and the shear resistance of the soil (HUANG; BRADFORD; LAFLEN, 1996).  \n\nIf the water flow at surface is laminar, particles removal is of uniform thickness over the \n\narea, causing what is called as sheet or interrow erosion (DESCROIX et al., 2008). When the \n\nflux concentrates and the flow becomes turbulent, soil removal occurs by forming intermittent \n\nrills (MORGAN, 2005). If these evolve to become persistent and deeper, the so called gullies \n\nare formed. In the current specialized literature, these have been divided into ephemeral \n\ngullies and gullies according to their depth and width (CHESWORTH, 2008). \n\n \n\n2.1.3.1.1.3 Particles and aggregates deposition \u2013 sealing and crust formation \n\nThe last step of the erosive process is the deposition of particles and aggregates that \n\nwere detached from the soil matrix. The deposition happens according to the size and weight \n\nof sediments. The first particles and aggregates to deposit are those with low transportability, \n\ni.e. the heavier and wider ones (BERTONI; LOMBARDI NETO, 2005). The lightest \n\n\n\n \n \n\n29 \n\nmaterials are the last ones to deposit, reaching larger distances from its origin. The runoff \n\nflow energy also influences the morphology and distribution of particles. Irregular depositions \n\nsuggest erosive events with turbulent flow, while uniform deposits, with well-selected grain \n\nsizes, are an indicative of laminar flow (MOMOLI et al., 2007). \n\nSediments properties differ according to their origin and, many times, can be \n\ndistinguished from local horizons by color, particles size distribution, organic carbon content, \n\npH and exchange complex constitution (FULLEN et al., 1996). Local sediments are, in \n\nessence, of coarser fractions, since clay and silt can be transported through larger distances. \n\nThe amount of clay and silt also increases in proportion to the slope, since the steeper slopes \n\ncontribute to the acceleration of runoff, increasing the soil erodibility. Hence, parental \n\nmaterial, relief and precipitation are the determinant factor influencing the size distribution of \n\nthe sediments. \n\nThe deposition of particles and aggregates over the original soil surface forms a layer \n\nwith different structure from the one underlying. The increase in thickness of this layer may \n\nchange the surface bulk density, due to an decrease in the porosity, followed by an decrease in \n\nits hydraulic properties, fact why this layer is called a \u201csoil seal\u201d. When this layer of soil dries \n\nout, is common to occur an increase in the resistance to penetration, while its aspect becomes \n\nbrittle and laminar, forming a so called \u201csoil crust\u201d. Although sometimes the terms soil \n\ncrusting and soil sealing are considered as synonymous, soil sealing describes the wet process \n\nin which porosity decreases due to a rearrangement of structure, while soil crusting marks the \n\nincrease in soil strength due to the drying of this rearranged structure (BERGSMA et al., \n\n2000).  \n\nConsidering the above, crusts can be separated into two types: structural and \n\ndepositional. These two types give birth to different microstructure morphologies, and may \n\noccur successively, initiating with the sealing of the surface by an structural brokenness, \n\nfollowed by an depositional process of particles on its top. Structural crusts are formed by the \n\nreorganization of the soil surface due to a local displacement of fragments, i.e., clods and \n\naggregates, without the sedimentation of particles. They are the result of gradual packaging \n\nand coalescence of small clods and aggregates, which are mainly produced by the breakdown \n\nof bigger aggregates due to an increased internal stress during wetting, i.e., slaking \n\n(NORTON; SCHROEDER; MOLDENHAUER, 1986). Depositional crusts are the result \n\nfrom the displacement of fragments and particles due selective decantation in puddles, formed \n\nduring the runoff process, where the water slowly infiltrate into the soil (KOOISTRA; \n\nSIDERIUS, 1986).  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n30 \n\n2.1.4 Soil surface roughness vs soil physical quality \n\nThe behavior of the soil surface structure has an important role on air, water and \n\nnutrients dynamics. In tropical and subtropical regions it is common to have high intensity \n\nrainfall events during summer seasons, and rainfall erosivity can lead to greater problems on \n\nbare and/or tilled soil. The raindrop impact changes soil microtopography, which controls \n\nsurface depressional water storage (BURWELL et al., 1963; HANSEN et al., 1999; \n\nBORSELLI; TORRI, 2010), drainage and runoff (SEGINER, 1969; ROMKENS et al., 2001), \n\nand even interferes on infiltration rates (BURWELL; LARSON, 1969; MAGUNDA et al., \n\n1997; GUZHA, 2004). Therefore, the state of the soil microtopography is dependent on, and \n\ncontrols, soil erosion (MAGUNDA et al., 1997; DARBOUX et al., 2005; RODR\u00cdGUEZ-\n\nCABALLERO et al., 2012). \n\nVery often, the roughness of a surface is a measure of its state. Smith (2014) ratify that \n\n\u201csurface roughness\u201d generically defines any \u201c\u2026resulting parameter\u2026that determines the \n\nminimum amount of information necessary to parameterize topographic complexity at a \n\ndegraded scale in the most physically meaningful way\u201d. He also states that this is subjective \n\nand dependent on the objectives of a study. Therefore, in soil science, the surface roughness is \n\nconsidered as a parameter that represents the variability of a set of (z) heights inside an (x, y) \n\narea and can be used to interpret the morphology of the microtopography. Commonly, this \n\nparameterization separates roughness into two classes: the Oriented Roughness, governed by \n\nthe slope and tillage marks, and the Random Roughness (RR), representing the distribution of \n\nsoil clods and particles (ALLMARAS et al., 1966; CURRENCE; LOVELY, 1970; \n\nKAMPHORST et al., 2000). The latter one, a major percentage of total roughness, is the most \n\nrelevant considering fluxes at surface, since it controls the dynamics of runoff and it is \n\ngoverned by soil intrinsic attributes (i.e. particles and clods size distribution, water dispersed \n\nclay and aggregates stability). \n\nConsequently, several devices that collect data are used to estimate roughness \n\nparameters. The pin meter (BURWELL et al., 1963), the laser profilometer (CURRENCE; \n\nLOVELY, 1970) and the infrared microrelief meter (MRM) (CASTRO et al., 2006; \n\nCASTILHO et al., 2011) are examples of equipments used in field, that perform readings of \n\n(z) heights in square grids with a (x,y) resolution ? 1 mm. Other devices, generally used in the \n\nlaboratory, case of Huang\u2019s laser scanner (HUANG et al., 1988) and the Multistripe Laser \n\nTriangulation (MLT) scanner (HIRMAS et al., 2016), reach finer horizontal resolutions, up to \n\n0.5 mm. In addition, computed tomography allows the generation of even higher resolution \n\nimages, as far as 0.02 mm (20 \u00b5m) by using standard X-ray computed tomography (XRT) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n31 \n\n(ELLIOT; REYNOLDS; HECK, 2010) or even 0.001 mm (1 \u00b5m) using X-ray \n\nmicrotomography (\u00b5XRT) (ZHOU et al., 2013). Information on increasing scales stimulates \n\nthe study of fragmentation processes caused by rainfall, because it allows mapping clods \n\ndisruption by reaching scales close to the actual size of the soil\u2019s primary particles, which was \n\nonly possible previously via mathematical and/or statistical modeling. Furthermore, the \n\ngathering of real physical data on different scales can help enhance models used to estimate \n\nmore complex variables (i.e. drainage, runoff, soil loss).  \n\nApart from the above, the roughness parameterization depends on distinct mathematical \n\napproaches as well. Allmaras et al. (1966) first used the standard error of log of heights, and \n\nCurrence and Lovely (1970) showed the standard deviation of heights was enough if Oriented \n\nRoughness was corrected. Since these indexes only represent the vertical range of roughness, \n\nwithout considering the spatial component (KAMPHORST et al., 2000), several authors tried \n\na geostatistical approach (VIDAL V\u00c1SQUEZ et al., 2009; DALLA ROSA et al., 2012). \n\nHowever, the scale factor is also important and fractal models were also used in conjunction \n\nto spatial modeling (HUANG; BRADFORD, 1992; VIDAL V\u00c1SQUEZ et al., 2005, 2010). \n\nTwo facts restrain the use of fractal theory on roughness analysis: (1) it relies on a single \n\nnumber to describe the whole system; (2) although fractal indices may represent \n\nmorphological responses to rainfall, they cannot be used to actually quantify fluids dynamics \n\nat the surface (KAMPHORST et al., 2000). In this sense, multifractal models excel. The \n\nmultifractal approach consider several dimensions related to local occurrence of probabilities \n\nof a process, which merges the information of scale and spatial distribution, making it \n\npossible to generate indexes that may be used to model complex variables. This rising \n\ntechnique in soil science is still little explored in the evaluation of surface roughness \n\n(GARC\u00cdA MORENO et al., 2008; SAN JOS\u00c9 MART\u00cdNEZ et al., 2009; VIDAL V\u00c1SQUEZ \n\net al., 2010), but it is very promising in the generation of parameters that may express \n\nstructural changes of the soil surface. \n\n \n\n2.1.5 Soil structure image analysis  \n\nMicromorphometrical analysis consists on the evaluation of thin sections taken from \n\nsoil blocks impregnated with polyester resin. This technique allows the study of the soil \n\nmicrostructure and to quantify the shape, size and soil pore connectivity using quantitative \n\nindexes related to pores and aggregate morphology (RINGROSE-VOASE, 1987; HORGAN, \n\n1998; HOLDEN, 2001). Since the pore system morphology is related to water movement and \n\nthe matrix arrangement is associated to pedogenic processes and biological activity (BOUMA \n\n\n\n \n \n\n32 \n\net al., 1977; RINGROSE-VOASE, 1987; PAGLIAI; DENOBILI, 1993) this technique has \n\naided in the study of the soil structure (RINGROSE-VOASE; BULLOCK, 1984). \n\nThe selection and interpretation of soil pore morphological parameters still requires \n\nresearch (DROOGERS et al., 1998; HOLDEN, 2001) and, although this approach allows to \n\nsystematically analyze a soil sample, it provides a partial result, since the analysis are made in \n\ntwo-dimensional soil sections.  \n\nThe computed tomography scan is an alternative to the bidimensional problem. This is a \n\nrelatively new technique in soil analysis, since X-rays were discovered only in the late \n\nnineteenth century by WC Roentgen (HECK, 2009). The X-rays attenuation index calculus \n\nobtained mathematical foundations only in 1963 by Cormack (CARVALHO, 2007) and initial \n\nworks using this technique to study the soil emerged only in the 1980s. It was widely used in \n\nthe study of soil porosity and hydraulic properties, initiating with innovative studies in the \n\n1980s, related to soil bulk density (HAINSWORTH; AYLMORE, 1983), water movement in \n\nsoil-plant system (PETROVIC et al., 1982) and soil moisture (CRESTANA, 1985). In the \n\nearly 1990s, it was used aiming to understand the structure morphology and behavior, by \n\nmacroporosity measurements (PHOGAT; AYLMORE, 1989; GREVERS et al., 1989; \n\nANDERSON et al., 1990), biopores reconstruction (JOSCHKO et al., 1992, 1993) and effect \n\nof aggregate size on solute transportation (ANDERSON et al., 1992). In the late 1990s and \n\nearly 2000s, the main use of this technique switched to understanding structure modifications \n\nin soils, such as due to cropping system (OLSEN; B\u00d8RRESEN, 1997), decomposition of \n\norganic waste (De GRYZE et al., 2006) and to wetting and drying cycles (PIRES et al., 2007). \n\nNevertheless, although the studies using CT brought a new approach to image analysis, \n\nthere was not a distinguished language used to describe soil structural quality that implicated \n\nin a leap between these and classical techniques. And the calculation of indexes that are \n\nactually based on a tridimensional approach is still scarce, since much work has been done \n\nanalyzing the bidimensional slices that form the reconstructed 3d image. \n\n \n\n2.2 Material and methods \n\nAn experiment with simulated rainfall was assembled on a Fine Rhodic Kandiudalf \n\n(SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2014), i.e., a Nitossolo Vermelho eutrof\u00e9rrico argiloso \n\n(EMBRAPA, 2013), located at 22\u00ba41\u201951.5\u201d S and 47\u00ba37\u201953.2\u201d W, at the \u201cLuiz de Queiroz\u201d \n\nCollege of Agriculture \u2013 University of Sao Paulo, in the city of Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil \n\n(Figure 3). Piracicaba is in an altitude of 554 meters, in a subtropical region of the state of Sao \n\nPaulo. Its climate is Cwa, according to the classification of K\u00f6ppen-Geiger. Temperatures \n\n\n\n \n \n\n33 \n\nthrough the year vary from a maximum of 310.65 K to a 289.15 K minimum. The annual \n\naverage rainfall is 1230 millimeters, with typically three dry months during the year (June, \n\nJuly and August).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Schematic showing the localization of a Fine Rhodic Kandiudalf (22\u00ba41\u201951.5\u201d S; 47\u00ba37\u201953.2\u201d W), at \n\n\u201cLuiz de Queiroz\u201d College of Agriculture, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, where an experiment with \n\nsimulated rainfall was assembled with quadruplicate plots divided in four blocks, each one containing \n\nthe treatments No-rainfall, 40, 80 and 120 mm of rainfall \n\n \n\nThe preparation of the soil, the sampling design and all measurements are described \n\nnext. \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Soil preparation and experimental design \n\nSoil preparation was carried at the end of March 2014, by two disk harrowing (24 discs \n\nx 50.80 cm) operations: the first was for soil breakdown and disturbance of grass clumps, and \n\nthe second, two weeks later, to simulate the conventional preparation of the seedbed. After the \n\ntillage operations, the soil was fully bare, presenting broken and partially decomposed straws \n\nof the previous crop (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and a distribution of different size clods. We \n\nremoved tillage marks using a rake, in order to diminish its interference in the Oriented \n\nRoughness. Then, the area was fenced, to impede animal passage, and 16 plots (1 m\n2\n) were \n\nestablished in a contour line following the elevation of the terrain. A gap of 0.5 m was left \n\n\n\n \n \n\n34 \n\nbetween plots to avoid drifts from neighboring treatments. A random blocks design divided \n\nthe contour line in 4 blocks wherein rainfall applications were randomized (Figure 4). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 (a) Picture of a Rhodic Kandiudalf after the second passage of a leveling harrow, (b) image showing \n\nhow was the slope of the area and the localization of the water tank, and (c) leveled photo from the 1 \n\nm\n2\n plots, demarcated by a black/yellow tape and arranged in a line perpendicular to the slope.

Six undisturbed \n\nsamples were collected by plot: two soil blocks (12 x 12 x 5 cm) were scanned by a \n\nmultistripe laser triangulation (MLT) scanner and a X-ray tomography (XRT) scanner, \n\nrespectively, to obtain information about surface roughness (item 2.2.4); two cylinders (2.5 x \n\n5 cm) were collected to measure the bulk density (item 2.2.5.2), and to model the water \n\nretention curve (item 2.2.5.3); two soil blocks (12 x 7 x 5 cm) were used in aggregate stability \n\ntests (item 2.2.5.2) and micromorphometrical analyses (item 2.2.6.1). One disturbed sample \n\nwas collected by experimental block at the surface (0-5 cm), to characterize the soil particles \n\ndistribution (item 2.2.5.2), pH and exchange complex composition (item 2.2.5.1) (Figure 5). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n35 \n\nThe particles size distribution and chemical composition of the exchange complex are \n\nsummarized on Table 1 and Table 2. The blocks were homogeneous. However, during \n\nstatistical procedures the block design was maintained due to other possible causes of \n\nvariance (e.g. terrain slope, machinery passage, etc.).  \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 (a) Disposition of the sampling inside each plot and (b) scheme with the measures of each sample: \n\ntwo cylinders with 50 mm in diameter, that were used for bulk density and water retention curve \n\nevaluations; two rectangular blocks (120 x 70 mm), that were used in micromorphometrical and \n\naggregates stability analyses; and two square soil blocks (120 mm x 120 mm) that were used in \n\nroughness analyses. The dots represent the resolution of roughness measurements. A field \n\nmicrorelief meter was used to gather information of the whole 1 m\n2\n plot (10 mm resolution).

The simulator operates at a \n\nheight of 2.4 m above the soil and consists of a oscillating spray nozzle (VeeJet Nozzle, H/U-\n\n80100, Spraying Systems, Co.) connected to a system that maintain a pendulum movement to \n\nsimulate rainfall in a total area of 1m\n2\n. The entire system is supported by metal pipes that \n\nbrings lightness and firmness at the same time. To avoid the effects of drift a plastic cover \n\nwas placed around the equipment (Figure 6a). \n\nThe rainfall intensity was chosen based on regional climate characteristics and soil \n\nstructural features. For example, Hudson (1965) stated that rainfall intensities over 25 mm h\n-1\n\n \n\nare erosive for most tropical and subtropical soils. However, soil erosion is a combination \n\nbetween rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility, which depends on intrinsic properties of soil, \n\nsuch as structural stability. Castilho et al. (2011), studying the same soil of this research \n\n(Rhodic Kandiudalf), found undisrupted clods even after 10 natural rainfalls with intensities \n\nhigher than 25 mm h\n-1\n\n. Magunda et al. (1997), in a similar soil (Mollic Kandiudalf), found \n\nminimal changes on soil surface roughness after 126 mm of simulated rainfall with an \n\nintensity of 63 mm h\n-1\n\n. These are evidences that such soils possess a highly stable structure. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n37 \n\nConsidering that, to fully understand this soil disruption behavior due to cumulative \n\nrainfall, higher intensities must be used during simulation tests, so that a wider range of \n\nstructural changes may be captured. \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Soil surface roughness measurements \n\nThe evolution of the surface roughness was evaluated in three scales of measurement. In \n\nthe field, a portable field microrelief meter (MRM) was used, coupled with an infrared sensor \n\n(GP2Y0A21YK0F, SHARP Corporation) with \u00b10.05 mm resolution, and making readings on \n\na fixed grid (10 x 10 mm), totaling 10,201 points per plot (Figure 6a). In the laboratory two \n\nfiner scales were obtained from soil blocks. One block from each plot was scanned by a \n\nmultistripe laser triangulation (MLT) scanner (NextEngine, Inc.), creating a random mesh \n\naveraging 60,000 points (resolution of 0.5 mm) (Figure 6c). A second block from each plot \n\nwas scanned using an X-ray tomography (XRT) scanner model XT H 225st, third generation, \n\nwith a total of 1918x1534 detectors (Figure 6b). To reduce artifacts and image noise a high \n\npassage filter was used. The acquisition voxel size was of 74.5 x 74.5 x 74.5 \u00b5m. This process \n\nresults in average of 3018 two-dimensional projection images that are reconstructed to portray \n\na three-dimensional soil structure. The final image was reconstructed using maximum \n\nresolution, and the process was filtered by back projection, using CT PR O 3D and \n\nVGSTUDIO.  \n\nTo minimize influences of artifacts and disturbances on samples edge, only a central \n\narea from each resulting mesh was analyzed, cropping areas of 800 x 800 mm, 75 x 75 mm \n\nand 30 x 30 mm for MRM, MLT and XRT, respectively.  \n\n \n\n2.2.5 Soil attributes \n\n2.2.5.1 Chemical analyses \n\nThe determinations of pH in water, CaCl2 0.01 mol L\n-1\n\n, KCl 1 mol L\n-1\n\n, and of the \n\ncontent of exchangeable aluminum (Al), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca) and \n\nmagnesium (Mg) were performed according to Raij et al. (2001). The Walkey-Black method \n\nwas used for the determination of the organic carbon content (OC), as described in Anderson \n\nand Ingram (1992). All soil samples were air dried and sieved (&lt;2 mm) prior to each \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 (a) Rainfall simulator (with a blue cape) and field microrelief meter (MRM) sensor (black device); (b) \n\nX-ray tomography (XRT) third generation scanner, with a total of 1918x1534 detectors (c) multistripe \n\nlaser triangulation (MLT) scanner; (d) soil block (120 x 120 mm) aligned at 150\u00ba and ready to be \n\nscanned by the MLT scanner; (e) example of a reconstructed image using the MLT accompanying \n\nsoftware \n\n \n\n2.2.5.2 Physical analyses \n\nThe bulk density (BD) (Mg m\n-3\n\n) was determined using the cylinder method according to \n\nGrossman and Reinsch (2002). Cylinders (2.5 x 2.5 cm) were collected in quadruplicates by \n\nrainfall amount. The particle size distribution was determined by the hydrometer method \n\n(GEE; OR, 2002), using 40 g of sieved disturbed samples (&lt;2 mm) after air dried. The \n\nnumber of replicates was the same as for the cylinder method used for BD. The particles \n\ndensity (PD) (Mg m\n-3\n\n) was determined from the same disturbed samples (&lt;2 mm) using a \n\nHelium pycnometer (AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation \u00ae). The ratio of \n\nvolume of pores (Pr) (m \n3\n m\n\n-3\n) was calculated from BD and PD (Equation 28), indicating the \n\nrelative amount of voids of the soil (VOMOCIL, 1965). \n\n     \n          \n\n  \n\n  \n  (28) \n\nAn aggregates stability test was conducted according to Le Bissonnais (1996) using \n\nblocks of soil (12 x 7 x 5 cm) collected in quadruplicates according to rainfall amount. The \n\nsurface of each block (0-10 mm) was ripped off, from which, aggregates were manually \n\n\n\n \n \n\n39 \n\nbroken and normalized to a diameter between 4 and 2 mm. The 10 mm layer was chosen in an \n\nattempt to boost the chances of detecting the changes caused by sealing. After, pre-treatments \n\nwere applied in triplicates of 5 g of normalized aggregates, dried at 313,15 K for 24 h. The \n\npre-treatments were: slow wetting, where dry aggregates were placed in a filter paper over a \n\nsaturated sponge and slowly moistened by capillary forces; fast wetting, where dry aggregates \n\nwere submerged directly into water; and mechanical breakdown, when dry aggregates were \n\npreviously moistened with alcohol and shaken, while submerged in water, with controlled \n\nenergy. After each pre-treatment, the aggregates were immersed in alcohol and sieved (0.053 \n\nmm), with the retained soil once again dried (313,15 K for 24 h). These dry aggregates were \n\nthen passed through a set of six sieves (2, 1, 0.5, 0.106 and 0.053 mm), generating an \n\naggregates size distribution, which was consequently used to calculate the weighted mean \n\ndiameter (WMD) (Equation 29).  \n\n              \n  \n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n (29) \n\nWMD considers the equivalent diameter of aggregates (  ), which is the average \n\ndiameter between a subsequent set of sieves (e.g. between sieves 2 mm and 1 mm    = 1.5 \n\nmm), having the relative mass of aggregates (\n  \n\n  \n) as weights.    is the total mass of \n\naggregates (5 g) and    is the mass of aggregates retained at each sieve i. \n\n \n\n2.2.5.3 Hydrological analyses \n\nSoil water retention curve (SWRC): The SWRC is the correlation between the \n\ngravimetric water content (?) and the matric potential in the soil (?m). Undisturbed soil \n\nsamples were collected in cylinders (2.5 x 2.5 cm). Using a nylon string, each cylinder was \n\nsubdivided into three parts (top, middle and bottom) while maintaining the original structure. \n\nThe subsamples were relocated to smaller cylinders (2.5 x 0.8 cm). Since there were \n\nquadruplicate samples for each rainfall amount, it totaled 48 subsamples. Curves were \n\ngenerated using these subsamples in pressure plates for potentials of -0.001; -0.003; -0.006; -\n\n0.008; -0.010; -0.033 -0.070 MPa and -0.100, and disturbed samples (&lt;2 mm) in high \n\npressure plates for potentials of -0.300, -0.500 and 1.5 MPa. The curves were fitted using the \n\nempirical model proposed by van Genuchten (1980), which parameters are the soil water \n\ncontents at saturation ?s and residual ?r, plus the empirical parameters n and ? (Equation 30). \n\nChanges in the inclination of the curves were evaluated using parameters n and ?. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n40 \n\n      \n       \n\n            \n \n   \n\n (30) \n\nSoil hydraulic conductivity [K(?)]: The hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated soil \n\nwas calculated by measurements with a mini disk infiltrometer (Mini Disk Infiltrometer, \n\nDecagon Devices) at four potentials (-1.5, -3.0, -4.5 and -6 cm) (Figure 5). To calculate the \n\nunsaturated hydraulic conductivity, the method by Zhang (1997) was used. \n\n \n\n2.2.6 Image analyses \n\n2.2.6.1 Micromorphometrical analyses \n\nUndisturbed soil samples, oriented to the surface and collected in cardboard boxes (0.12 \n\nx 0.07 x 0.05 m), were impregnated using a polyester resin (MURPHY, 1986), styrene \n\nmonomer (CASTRO et al., 2003), a catalyzer (RINGROSE-VOASE, 1991) and a fluorescent \n\npigment (MURPHY et al., 1977). The impregnation procedure and image acquisition was \n\ndone as described by Castro et al. (2003). \n\nIn the laboratory, the samples were air dried for 10 days and at 313.15 K with forced air \n\ncirculation for 48 hours. These samples were put in containers and placed in a desiccator \n\nconnected to a vacuum pump, which helps the solution to penetrate the pores. The \n\nimpregnation was held by a solution of polyester resin and styrene monomer (1/1), using a \n\nhardening solute (Butanox M50, 10 drops L\n-1\n\n of solution) and a fluorescent colorant (Tinopal \n\nOB, Ciba-Geigy\u00ae, 5 g L\n-1\n\n of solution). After drying, the samples were sliced in blocks and \n\npolished. Image (1024x768 pixels) acquisition using a digital color camera (Sony DFW-\n\nX700) in 10X magnification (156.25 \u00b5m\n2\n pixel\n\n-1\n) was made using a charged couple device \n\n(CCD) system, connected to a magnifying glass with a polarizer (Zeiss). \n\nEach block was divided into three layers (0 to 10 mm, 20 to 30 mm and 40 to 50 mm), \n\nparallel to surface, and five images were taken from each layer. After taking the pictures, \n\nimages analyses, using software ImageJ, followed the steps showed in Figure 7: each RGB \n\nimage (24 bits) was converted to 8 bits (256 gray-levels); since most images showed artifacts \n\nrelated to illumination, with central pixels presenting higher values than those from the edge, \n\na filter was applied around the image to smooth the values around the image center; after this \n\ncorrection, plugin \u201cCTofsoil\u201d was used to select areas of low variance in an attempt to smooth \n\nthe histogram and facilitate the segmentation process; an average histogram was calculated \n\nfor all blocks and used to choose the threshold between pores and solids; after segmentation, \n\npores with equivalent diameter less than 50 \u00b5m (?13 pixels) were excluded prior to any \n\ncalculations. Then, three representative images, from each layer, were used in further analysis.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Example from steps of the binarization of a bidimensional image. (a) RGB image taken using a digital color camera (Sony DFW -X700) in 10X magnification; (b) \n\nimage transformed to a unique 8 bit channel of 256 grey-level colors; (c) 8 bit image after correcting the illumination distribution; (d) 8 bit image where areas with \n\nlow variance (grey) were demarked to calculate a histogram; (e) binary image with white pores (255) and black matrix (0); (f)  binary image after deleting pores \n\nwith diameter less than 50 \u00b5m (<13 pixels) \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nThe total area of pores (%) was estimated by the ratio between the number of pixels \n\nrepresenting the pore system and the total number of pixels of the image (MORAN et al. \n\n1988). The classification of pores by shape and size was executed using software Soil Pore \n\nImage Analysis - SPIA (COOPER et al., 2016). \n\n \n\n2.2.6.2 Soil surface roughness analyses \n\nBoth MRM and MLT generate (x, y, z) data frames to create Digital Elevation Models \n\n(DEM). These were rasterized into matrices, whose rows and columns dimensions represents \n\n(x, y) coordinates and cell values are (z) heights, which were interpreted as grey-level images, \n\nhaving the cells as pixels and the heights as bit depth. For XRT three-dimensional binary \n\nimages, the surface was estimated by adding the number of (z) axe voxels, at each (x, y) \n\nposition, from the first bidimensional slice of the surface (pure air) until the first one \n\nrepresenting the solid phase. Then, by subtracting the total number of slices and multiplying \n\nthe resulting two-dimensional image by the scan\u2019s resolution (0.0745 mm) we obtained a \n\nrepresentation of the surface of the soil. \n\nOnce we gathered the images from all scales, general trends of terrain slope (Oriented \n\nRoughness) were removed by linear regressions, and all calculations were made using the \n\nabsolute value of the models deviations. Data were rearranged to present a minimum height of \n\n1 mm. Since MLT scanner measures the distortion patterns of lasers over an object (HIRMAS \n\net al., 2016), places where light is lost (cracks) creates gaps in the DEM. These gaps were not \n\nconsidered in descriptive statistics and interpreted as zero (0) during multifractal calculations, \n\nwhich interferes in some spectra features that will be explained next. \n\nThere are several roughness indexes that have been used in rainfall simulation studies \n\n(BERTUZZI et al., 1990). However, the facility of calculation and the good correlation with \n\nrainfall (ELTZ; NORTON, 1997), as to other important variables (KAMPHORST et al., \n\n2000; GARC\u00cdA MORENO et al., 2008), makes the random roughness index RRi a suitable \n\nindex to be used on describing soil roughness behavior across rainfall increase, reason to why \n\nit was used as an standard measure in this study (Equation 31). It is the standard deviation of k \n\nheights    within a plot with average height    (KAMPHORST et al., 2000). \n\n      \n \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n (31) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n43 \n\n2.2.6.3 Multifractal analysis \n\nFor all images the multifractal spectrum f(?) was calculated using the partition function \n\n?i(q, L) (Equation 22) and a box-counting technique. By covering an image with boxes of \n\ndifferent sizes L and applying Equation 23 for a range of q values (q   ) is possible to \n\ncalculate ?(q) and f(q) (Equations 24 and 25). In this method, a grid of boxes of size L covers \n\nthe image and the number of boxes that contain at least one pixel representing the object of \n\nstudy is counted (POSADAS et al., 2003). \n\nMultifractal spectra from the 2d images and the maps were calculated according to \n\nPosadas et al. (2003) with the software Multifractal Analysis System 3.0 \n\n(http://inrm.cip.cgiar.org/home/downmod.htm; accessed on 27 June 2015). For the \n\ncalculations using the 3d images an ImageJ plugin was used. For each image, maximum and \n\nminimum q values were selected when f(q) and ?(q) were linear functions (R\n2\n ? 0.98). Values \n\nof q were estimated using a ?q of 0.1 to create a more detailed spectrum. \n\nAs shown in Figures 1 and 2 the f(?) spectra presents a convex parabolic shape, from \n\nwhere several parameters are known or can be estimated. The parameters evaluated during \n\nthis research were: D0, D1, D2, D0-D1, D0-D2, D1-D2, Lf(?)min, ?Lf(?), Rf(?)min,, ?Rf(?), \n\n?min,, ?max, ?L?, ?R?, ??, f(?)ratio and ?ratio. \n\nIt was discussed that D0 is a fractional dimension of the mass contained in a fragmented \n\nsystem, i.e. one that possesses parts with and without mass. For example, if someone wants to \n\nanalyze the pore system of a soil, the pore phase is considered as the one containing the mass \n\nof the system, while the solids are considered weightless during the analyses. When all points \n\nhave mass, D0 is equal to the object\u2019s topological dimension. Since roughness analyses \n\nconsider a surface, D0 should be equal to 2 for all plots. However, the MLT data, as explained \n\nin item XXX, present gaps, and D0 was not exactly 2 for this dataset. Nevertheless, how D0 \n\nrelates to other dimensions is less affected by the gaps if the covered area (i.e. the area \n\ncontaining mass) is prevalent, since points with mass have major influence over spectrum \n\nformat, especially considering its left side. All MLT images presented 90% or more of \n\ncovered area, thus this feature was not considered as a problem. \n\nAlthough previous information from each parameter was presented on section 2.1.1.3.3, \n\nspecific interpretations are presented here. Lf(?)min can be interpreted as the fractal dimension \n\nof micro-watersheds in roughness analyses, or large macropores in pore system analyses. \n\n?Lf(?) represents the homogeneity of the fragmentation at these areas, and values closer to 0 \n\nmay show a unifractal process, or one dominated by micro-valleys and smaller macropores. \n\nSimilar interpretations can be made at the right side for Rf(?)min and ?Rf(?). ? shows how the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n44 \n\nsame range of heights, or pores sizes, change across scales. Thus, ?min shows how the \n\ndistribution of the highest micro-watersheds, or larger macropores, changes over scale, and \n\n?max how it happens for the lowest micro-valleys and smaller macropores. ?L? and ?R? \n\nindicate which class of heights and macropores changes more over scale when compared to \n\nthe systems\u2019 mean. ?? represents diversity across scales, i.e. how differentiated it is its \n\nroughness or porosity. f(?)ratio and ?ratio shows the ratio between micro-valleys and micro-\n\nwatersheds, or between large and small macropores, and it is an indicative of which class is \n\nmore fragmented or changes more across scales. \n\n \n\n2.2.7 Statistical analyses \n\nIn the case of soil roughness, since the datasets were large (e.g. the smallest grid had \n\nmore than 6,000 points), initial evaluation was made by descriptive statistics (maximum, \n\nminimum, mean, median, mode, variance, skewness and kurtosis) of each heights and \n\nexploratory analysis using histograms. Although all calculations were carried out with \n\noriginal height values, histograms present a logarithmic abscissa, for better visual \n\ninterpretations. In the case of the aggregates stability an exploratory analysis was made using \n\nthe plot of the distribution of masses of aggregates according the equivalent diameters. These \n\nvariables were important to characterize the behavior of soil surface according to rainfall \n\namount before interpreting the multifractal parameters. For bulk density, ratio volume of \n\npores, aggregates size distribution, random roughness index, unsaturated soil hydraulic \n\nconductivity, image pores distribution and all multifractal parameters, direct measures of \n\ndifferences between means were used in interpretations. \n\nAn Anova with randomized blocks was applied to all variables and each multifractal \n\nparameter, and significant differences (p &lt;0.10) were considered in further analyses. In the \n\nanalysis of the soil surface roughness, the scale of measurement was used as an additional \n\nfactor to rainfall amount as a cause of variance. For images pore analysis and water retention \n\ncurves depth was the additional factor, since the impregnated blocks and the cylinders were \n\ndivided in three layers before each analysis. \n\nBefore comparing means, we checked the homogeneity of variances amongst treatments \n\nusing Levene\u2019s test. In case of homoscedasticity, Tukey-Kramer Honest Significance \n\nDistance (Tukey HSD) was used, as for heteroscedasticity, Dunnett\u2019s modified Tukey-Kramer \n\n(DTK) pairwise multiple comparison was used instead. When differences in means across \n\nrainfall amounts were significant (p &lt;0.10) and a linear pattern was observed, linear \n\nregressions were used to explain behavior across rainfall. The coefficient of determination \n\n\n\n \n \n\n45 \n\n(R\u00b2) was used to check the models explained variance, and the significance of the angular \n\ncoefficient (slope) was used for comparisons and interpretations.  \n\nAll tests and regressions were made using R-project software (R CORE TEAM, 2015). \n\nHomogeneity test used functions of package \u201ccar\u201d (FOX; WEISBERG, 2011), and mean tests \n\nfrom packages \u201cagricolae\u201d and \u201cDTK\u201d (LAU, 2013; MENDIBURU, 2015). \n\n \n\n2.3 Results and discussion \n\n2.3.1 Soil surface roughness \n\nIn an initial glance over samples\u2019 DEMs on each scale, we notice that physical changes \n\nhappens on all scales with rainfall application, considering the opposite treatments of no-\n\nrainfall and 120 mm ( \n\nFigure 8). Even in a coarser scale (MRM), there is a smoothing after rainfall, with a \n\ndiminishing appearance of peaks and a spreading of the valley over the area. The persistent \n\npeaks represent very stable clods that do not disrupt even after 120 mm of rainfall. In higher \n\nscales there is a more pronounced flattening. This happens mainly because sample size is \n\nsmaller and covers an area smaller than the average size clod. Thus, on such scales, disruption \n\nof very small clods (MLT) and particles spreading (XRT) are expected to be the dominant \n\nprocesses. This may be seen in the flatter and smother image from MLT after rainfall, \n\nindicating general dismantlement of clods, and flatter, but more rugged, image from XRT, \n\nindicating the presence of small particles covering the surface. \n\nLooking on descriptive statistical parameters of heights response to rainfall increase, we \n\nnote, a general negative linear behavior for the variance of MRM, while its maximum, mean, \n\nmedian and mode, and all variables (less skewness and kurtosis) of MLT and XRT, present a \n\nnegative quadratic behavior, with maxima around 80 mm (MRM) and 40 mm (MLT and \n\nXRT) of rainfall (Table 3). The negative linear behavior of variance was expected, since it is \n\nreasonable to think that when rainfall increases, more clods disrupt, and heights tend to \n\ndiminish, as well as its variability. The initial increase of these parameters on MLT and XRT \n\nshow that, at the beginning of the disruption process, the surface becomes more complex, i.e. \n\nrougher. It is easy to imagine that, at the beginning of the rainfall event, some clods disrupt \n\nmore easily than others, and that not all pulverize entirely, instead they break into increasingly \n\nsmaller clods. This increases heterogeneity of heights, especially in areas closer to more stable \n\nclods. As stated before, MRM gathers information of larger features, showing how average \n\nsize clods behave with rainfall increase. In this case, a linear decrease of heights is expected, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n46 \n\nbecause it represents the average behavior of the system, which is a general flattening. \n\nHowever, at a larger scale, where the small clods are responsible for the aspect of the \n\nroughness, anything that increases the quantity of this type of clods will favor the increase of \n\nheight differences.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Digital elevation models from the surface of a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf, before (No rainfall) and after \n\nrainfall simulation (120 mm), obtained in three scales, by: a field microrelief meter sensor (MRM, 10 \n\n\u2013 800 mm); a multistripe laser triangulation scanner (MLT, 0.5 \u2013 50 mm); and an X-ray tomographer \n\n(XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm) \n\n \n\nThe mean, the median and the mode represent the central tendency, which means that an \n\nincrease in these variables is not always accompanied by an increase in variance, but can \n\nshow that the distribution has shifted right. MRM skewness at 80 mm shows a light skewness \n\nleft (-0.04), which may represent such displacement. However, since the variance reduces, the \n\nincrease of these variables just means that during clod breakdown micro-valleys are filled \n\nfaster than peaks are destroyed. In summary, proximity between means, medians and modes \n\n\n\n \n \n\n47 \n\nwithin rainfall amount, plus skewness and kurtosis data, show that heights behave very close \n\nto normal [P~N(\u00b5, ?\u00b2)] in all scales.

When rainfall has not \n\noccurred yet, both MLT and XRT show very similar distributions. MRM has a larger \n\ndistribution of heights. More or less, all distributions could be extrapolated to a normal after \n\n80 mm of rainfall. However, at 40 mm, MLT and XRT present a bimodal distribution. This \n\nagrees with the initial increment in variance after the first rainfall, since, as explained before, \n\nsoon after rainfall, the heterogeneity is enhanced, and different classes of clods size are \n\ncreated in a short space of time during disruption process. This contributes to the appearance \n\nof peaks that represent each new clod size class that dominate the surface. Nevertheless, \n\nconsidering all other rainfall amounts and scales, there is nothing that extrapolates to much \n\nnormality. Allmaras et al. (1966) recommended the logarithm transformation of heights, but \n\nCurrance and Lovely (1970), and Kamphorst et al. (2000), also stated that most heights \n\ndistributions behave as normal. Considering all histograms, and skewness and kurtosis values, \n\nno transformations were used to normalize the dataset. \n\n \nFigure 9 \u2013 Histograms from surface elevation measurements on a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf, before (No rainfall) \n\nand after rainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120 mm), obtained in three scales, by: a field microrelief \n\nmeter sensor (MRM, 10 \u2013 800 mm); a multistripe laser triangulation scanner (MLT, 0.5 \u2013 50 mm); \n\nand an X-ray tomography scanner (XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nRainfall increase appears to concentrate distributions over all scales, with more \n\nmarkedly features on MLT and XRT, where we see more narrow and peaked distributions \n\nafter 120 mm of rainfall. XRT becomes very narrow at 120 mm, when its central value \n\nrepresents more than 50% of the distribution. At the same rainfall amount, MRM have bigger \n\ntails on both sides and presents more subtle changes, concentrating on a uniform distribution \n\nbetween 15 and 25 mm. Increasing rainfall augment the possibility of clods disruption, which \n\nis expected to homogenize heights, which would cause the narrowing of the histograms. \n\nDifferences in scales are basically related to range. While MLT and XRT present very similar \n\nhistograms: on first two rainfall amounts both are centered around 8 mm, and after 120 mm \n\npresent distinct narrowing degrees; MRM is always centered above 20 mm. Thus, different \n\nparametrization is expected for each scale. \n\n \n\n2.3.1.1 Random Roughness - RRi \n\nIn  \n\nTable 4 we find the average from all variables (RRi and multifractal parameters) of each \n\nfactor (rainfall and scale). The Anova showed that RRi had differences (p &lt;0.10) among \n\nscales within all rainfall amounts, and among rainfalls only for MLT and XRT. After testing \n\npairwise means, differences among rainfalls presented no significance (p > 0.10), while MRM \n\nwas considered significantly different from MLT and XRT. The difference in range was \n\nenough to differentiate scales; however, the subtle narrowing of distributions was not \n\nexpressed by RRi. Magunda et al. (1997) also found, in a Mollic Kandiudalf with similar \n\nparticles size distribution and carbon content as the soil of this study, only 5% reduction in \n\nRRi after 126 mm of simulated rainfall in a scale from 25 to 200 mm. Hence, in stable soils it \n\nseems to be difficult to find more accentuated differences along rainfall application. This \n\ncorroborates results showed on section 2.3.2.2, where aggregates size distributions did not \n\npresent significant differences (p > 0.10) along rainfall application. \n\nSeveral studies use RRi as an independent variable to model more difficult to obtain soil \n\nattributes. Considering that, we did a linear regression between average RRi and rainfall \n\namount for each scale (Figure 10). For rainfall amount, only MRM had a very significant (p &lt;\n\n0.05) slope (?1 = -0.0048), but still not very far from 0. The heteroscedasticity of MLT and \n\nXRT, confirmed by Levene\u2019s test, must be the contributing factor to diminish the significance \n\n(p &lt;0.2) on these scales, since they present increasingly smaller coefficients (?1 = -0.0078; ?1 \n\n= -0.0112), which would indicate a more accentuated response to rainfall by magnifying the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n51 \n\nscale of measurement. Even if there is a general decreasing behavior of RRi according to \n\nrainfall amount, the lack of significance makes it difficult to consider this variable as a good \n\nindicator of surface behavior. Significance appears to be linked specifically to the range of \n\nvariances within each factor. This can lead to two hypothesis: (i) RRi is not effective in \n\nevaluating rainfall effects in this type of soil; or (ii) the lack of significance is related to the \n\nactual inexistence of physical differences on soil surface after rainfall. Since the second \n\nhypothesis is easily refuted by visual examinations of surface before and after rainfall, other \n\nparameters may explain better changes of soil surface with rainfall across scales. \n\n \nSlope (?1) p-values: \u201c^^\u201d&lt;0.35, \u201c^\u201d &lt;0.2, \u201c*\u201d &lt;0.1 and \u201c**\u201d &lt;0.05 \n\n \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Linear regressions from Random Roughness indexes (RRi) of a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf with rainfall \n\namount as independent variable.

For MLT and XRT \n\nthere are clearer differences on both ? and f(?) ranges, with a narrowing of ? and decreasing \n\nof Lf(?)min and Rf(?)min with rainfall increase. Differences between scale have MRM with \n\n\n\n \n \n\n52 \n\nwider and longer spectra, while MLT and XRT are more similar, with differences related to \n\nrange of dimensions. \n\n \nFigure 11 - Multifractal spectra of elevations from a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No rainfall) and after \n\nrainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120 mm), obtained in three scales, by: a field microrelief meter sensor \n\n(MRM, 10 \u2013 800 mm); a multistripe laser triangulation scanner (MLT, 0.5 \u2013 50 mm); and an X-ray \n\ntomography scanner (XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm) \n\n \n\nTo simplify interpretations, the parameters on Table 4 were used to unravel the \n\nmultifractal behavior of soil surface. For MRM, no parameters were significantly different \n\nacross rainfall, even the ones related to the left spectrum side [Lf(?)min, ?Lf(?)]. Again, for this \n\nscale, the variability within rainfall amount was too high to consider average spectra \n\ndifferences as a response to physical differences. This may confirm that on this soil and at this \n\nscale (from 10 to 800 mm), rainfall input is not enough to cause a modification on the general \n\nmultifractal pattern of surface roughness. This type of soil is known to present high stability. \n\nStudying roughness changes by natural rainfall at the same soil, Castilho et al. (2011) noticed \n\na reduction in total roughness after rainfall. However, they state that random clods would \n\npersist (i.e. undisrupted) even after 10 rainfall events. This stability favors a heterogeneous \n\nbehavior of surface roughness even with rainfall. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Parameters calculated from roughness maps, from a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No rainfall) and after rainfall simulations (40, 80 \n\nand 120 mm), obtained in three scales, by: a field microrelief meter sensor (MRM, 10 \u2013 800 mm); a multistripe laser triangulation \n\nscanner (MLT, 0.5 \u2013 50 mm); and an X-ray tomographer (XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm) \n\n  MRM MLT XRT \n\n  No Rainfall 40 mm 80 mm 120 mm No Rainfall 40 mm 80 mm 120 mm No Rainfall 40 mm 80 mm 120 mm \n\nRRi 8.50 A 8.48 A 8.15 A 7.97 A 2.21 aB 2.31 aB 1.51 aB 1.43 aB 1.92 aB 2.12 aB 1.09 aB 0.77 aB \n\nD1 1.988 \n \n\n1.984 B 1.991 B 1.984 C 1.986 a 1.992 aA 1.990 aB 1.996 aB 1.996 \n \n\n1.999 A 2.000 A 2.000 A \n\nD2 1.958 B 1.944 B 1.970 B 1.945 B 1.952 bAB 1.969 abAB 1.961 abB 1.986 aA 1.987 A 1.994 A 1.997 A 1.996 A \n\nD0-D1 0.0117 \n \n\n0.0158 A 0.0087 A 0.0158 A 0.0155 a 0.0090 aAB 0.0107 aA 0.0045 aB 0.0037 \n \n\n0.0015 B 0.0005 B 0.0005 B \n\nD0-D2 0.0418 A 0.0558 A 0.0298 A 0.0553 A 0.0487 aAB 0.0322 aAB 0.0397 aA 0.0152 aB 0.0127 B 0.0065 B 0.0032 B 0.0037 B \n\nD1-D2 0.0300 A 0.0400 A 0.0210 A 0.0395 A 0.0333 aAB 0.0233 aAB 0.0290 aA 0.0108 aB 0.0090 B 0.0050 B 0.0028 B 0.0033 B \n\nRf(?)min 1.726  \n1.662 \n\n \n1.716 \n\n \n1.769 \n\n \n1.819 a 1.783 a 1.711 a 1.717 a 1.703 \n\n \n1.707 \n\n \n1.787 \n\n \n1.712 \n\n \nLf(?)min 1.694 B 1.681 B 1.658 B 1.669  \n\n1.827 aA 1.743 abAB 1.739 abAB 1.614 b 1.930 aA 1.875 abA 1.803 bcA 1.693 c \n\nR?f(?) 0.275 \n \n\n0.339 \n \n\n0.284 \n \n\n0.231 \n \n\n0.183 a 0.218 a 0.290 a 0.284 a 0.315 \n \n\n0.293 \n \n\n0.214 \n \n\n0.288 \n \n\nL?f(?) 0.306 A 0.319 A 0.342 A 0.331 \n \n\n0.174 bB 0.258 abAB 0.262 abAB 0.387 a 0.088 bB 0.125 bB 0.197 abB 0.308 a \n\nf(?)ratio 0.915 A 1.230 B 0.841 \n \n\n0.908 \n \n\n1.045 A 0.950 B 1.109 \n \n\n0.785 \n \n\n5.710 aA 2.416 aA 1.071 a 0.979 a \n\n?min 1.904 B 1.895 B 1.916 B 1.898 B 1.925 AB 1.923 B 1.916 B 1.936 AB 1.979 aA 1.979 aA 1.977 aA 1.971 aA \n\n?max 2.157 A 2.185 A 2.165 A 2.156 A 2.141 A 2.102 B 2.136 A 2.087 B 2.090 aA 2.048 abB 2.030 bB 2.028 bC \n\n?? 0.253 A 0.290 A 0.249 A 0.258 A 0.216 AB 0.179 B 0.219 A 0.151 B 0.111 B 0.069 C 0.053 B 0.057 C \n\n?R? 0.144 A 0.168 A 0.154 A 0.139 A 0.125 A 0.093 B 0.125 A 0.083 B 0.085 aA 0.046 abB 0.029 bB 0.027 bC \n\n?L? 0.109 A 0.122 A 0.095 A 0.119 A 0.091 AB 0.086 B 0.094 A 0.069 B 0.026 B 0.023 C 0.024 B 0.030 B \n\n?ratio 1.344 B 1.373  \n1.650 A 1.240 A 1.435 B 1.048 \n\n \n1.356 A 1.180 A 3.218 aA 2.056 ab 1.087 bA 0.829 bA \n\nqmin -3.43 A -3.95 A -3.28 A -3.10 A -2.85 A -4.80 A -4.08 A -6.80 A -8.10 aB -18.68 aA -17.50 aB -36.48 aA \n\nqmax 6.93 A 6.28 B 8.88 B 7.30 A 8.68 A 6.15 B 6.50 B 12.98 A 18.40 A 17.90 A 21.23 A 34.90 A \n\nLower case letters represent significant differences (p &lt;0.10) between rainfall amounts within scales and uppercase letters represent significant differences (p &lt;0.10) \n\nbetween scales within rainfall.

This behavior contributes to maintain a high variability of \n\nsurface roughness even after rainfall application, which would reflect on the spectra. \n\nFor MLT, that represents a larger scale, from 0.5 and 75 mm, the case was different. \n\nThere were significant differences (p &lt;0.10) for f(?) parameters D2, Lf(?)min and L?f(?). As \n\nexplained before, f(?) can be interpreted as the fractal dimension of areas with same \n\nprobability, and which scale organization relates to the magnitude of an specific ? range (? + \n\n ?). In other words, f(?) is a fragmentation index of an specific class of probabilities, \n\nrepresented by a fractional number between 1 and 2 (i.e. topological dimension of a surface). \n\nSmaller the value of f(?), more fragmented is the region represented by this range of \n\nprobabilities and smaller is the area covered by such features. On MLT, Lf(?)min significantly \n\n(p &lt;0.10) decreases from 1.827, before rainfall, to 1.614, after 120 mm of rainfall. The \n\nLf(?)min represents the dimension of areas with high probabilities (peaks). Therefore, the \n\ndecrease in Lf(?)min means that peak areas are becoming more sparse, which would happen if \n\nthe surface is getting flatter. Not only Lf(?)min is related to the flattening process, but it also \n\nshows at what degree the process diminishes at each rainfall amount, since it represents the \n\narea filling capacity of one class of probabilities. This may be better observed by L?f(?). It \n\nshows that the interval between D0, the average filling capacity of the system, and Lf(?)min, \n\nsignificantly (p &lt;0.10) increase from 0.174 to 0.387. This means that after 120 mm of rainfall \n\nthe peaks has twice less filling capacity than before rainfall, which implicates in twice less \n\nchance of finding high points  over the surface. \n\nFor reasons explained in section 2.2.6.3, MLT does not have D0 = 2 for all images, \n\nwhich may dislocate D2. However, without considering the gross value of D0, the behavior \n\nacross rainfalls must be explored. D2 is an specific value of f(?) that represents the correlation \n\nof the measures contained in a L size box. Thus, the increase from 1.952, before rainfall, to \n\n1.986, after 120 mm of rainfall, shows that the correlation is increasing with rainfall increase. \n\nThat is, the local dimensions of different areas within an L size box, are becoming similar. \n\nThis shows once again how the surface becomes homogeneous with rainfall increase, and that \n\nthere is a positive spatial pattern, where higher heights will have more probability of being \n\nsurround by other high points. \n\nFor XRT the behavior was similar on f(?), with significant (p &lt;0.10) differences on \n\nLf(?)min, decreasing from 1.930 to 1.693, and L?f(?), increasing from 0.088 to 0.308. \n\nNevertheless, XRT also had significant (p &lt;0.10) differences for ? parameters ?max, ?R? and \n\n\n\n \n \n\n55 \n\n?ratio. We have to remember that ? values show how height distribution changes \n\nproportionally to scale. It represents the slope of the linear relation of [logPi(L)/logL], and, \n\nbecause of the logarithm, smaller probabilities relate to higher ? values. That is why the right \n\nside of the spectrum is related to the micro-valleys (i.e. areas with small probabilities). Since \n\nit is a slope, ? represent the rate in which probabilities change along scales. ?max then \n\nrepresents how fast areas with smaller probabilities change across scale. For XRT, rainfall \n\nincrease changes ?max from 2.090 to 2.028. Thus, rainfall enables a reduction in rate on which \n\nthe micro-valleys distribution will change along scale. ?R?, which show how ?max distances \n\nfrom the systems average, decreases from 0.085 to 0.027, showing that, after rainfall, scale \n\nhas four times less influence over low probabilities areas when compared with the average \n\nheight of the surface. ?ratio is the relation between right and left side of the spectrum. That is, \n\nit shows which range of probabilities change more along the scales. Before rainfall, ?ratio is \n\n3.218, which means that valleys change more than peaks along the scales. At 80 mm of \n\nrainfall, the ratio almost becomes one (1.087), which indicate that extremes (i.e. peaks and \n\nmicro-valleys) behave similarly among the scales. After 120 mm of rainfall ?ratio is 0.829, \n\nindicating that the low probabilities area changes less across scales than the peaks. \n\nConsidering there were no significant differences (p > 0.10) on Rf(?)min, the fragmentation of \n\nthe micro-valleys is the same across rainfall, but with smaller differences among scales, which \n\nmeans the heights are closer to the average, i.e. more homogeneous. \n\nDifferences across scales of measurement happened for almost all variables. Once again \n\nD2, Lf(?)min, L?f(?), ?max, ?R? and ?ratio had significant differences (p &lt;0.10), but also there \n\nwere differences (p &lt;0.10) on D1, D0-D1, D0-D2, D1-D2, f(?)ratio, ?L?, ?R?, ?min and ?ratio. \n\nOnly Rf(?)min and R?f(?), were not different across scales (p > 0.10). This means the variance \n\non the right side of spectra is too high to permit average differences between scales. The right \n\nside relates to the negative range of q\u2019s, which mathematically contributes to enhance the \n\nvariance of the estimates on this part of the spectrum. To circumvent such problem, some \n\nauthors have used a method called \u201cgliding box\u201d to increase the number of L size boxes \n\nduring calculations and diminish the variance on the right side of the spectra (GARC\u00cdA \n\nMORENO et al., 2008). However, since 18 parameters were sensitive in differentiating scales \n\nin this research, the box-counting method seems to be suffice in analysis of this kind. In \n\nalmost all comparison between f(?) parameters (D2, D0-D2, D1-D2, Lf(?)min, L?f(?)) MLT is \n\nnot different (p > 0.10) from XRT. For ? parameters (?L?, ?R? and ?ratio) this was not always \n\ntrue, with XRT presenting significantly smaller ?L? and ?R? and larger ?ratio values at \n\ndifferent rainfall amounts. This diversity is related to the narrowing of the ? range with grid \n\n\n\n \n \n\n56 \n\nincrement. The finer grid, associated to a smaller area of measurement, influence the scale \n\narrangement of probabilities, since differences in height start to diminish. However, it is \n\ninteresting to note that the fragmentation is similar on these two scales of measurement. \n\n \nSlope (?1) p-values: \u201c^^\u201d&lt;0.35, \u201c^\u201d &lt;0.2, \u201c*\u201d &lt;0.1 and \u201c**\u201d &lt;0.05 \n\nFigure 12 - Linear regressions from parameters D2: correlation dimension, Lf(?)min: minimum Hausdorff \n\ndimension at left of D0, ?Lf(?): range of Hausdorff dimensions at left of D0, estimated from \n\nmultifractal spectra of a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No rainfall = 0 mm) and after rainfall \n\nsimulations (40, 80 and 120 mm), obtained in two scales of measurement, by: a multistripe laser \n\ntriangulation scanner (MLT, 0.5 \u2013 50 mm; solid line and + symbols); and an X-ray tomography \n\nscanner (XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm; dashed line and x symbols) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n57 \n\nSince no parameters were significant for MRM, we can only use the mutltifractal \n\nparameterization on MLT and XRT data. Considering the previous discussion, the \n\nregressions, according to rainfall, of the average parameters D2, Lf(?)min and L?f(?) from \n\nthese two scales are displayed on Figure 12. Parameter D2 has the lowest R\u00b2 (0.57, 0.70), and \n\nslopes (-0.00023, -0.00008) are very close to 0, with relatively high p-values (0.16, 0.11). \n\nLf(?)min and L?f(?) had more significant (p > 0.05, 0.01; 0.05, 0.02) slopes (-0.00161, -\n\n0.00196; 0.00161, 0.00183), and models that better explain the variability along rainfall (R\u00b2= \n\n0.84, 0.96; 0.84, 0.93). Hence, these two variables are the most import for describing the soil \n\nsurface roughness variability across rainfalls. Most importantly, since there are no significant \n\ndifferences (p > 0.44, 0.65) between slopes of different measurement methods, one may be \n\nchosen over the other in the evaluation of the surface roughness. \n\n2.3.2 Physical attributes \n\n2.3.2.1 Bulk Density and Ratio of Volume of Pores \n\nIn an initial evaluation we can use simple parameters that relate to soil structural \n\nchanges. The average bulk density (BD) and ratio of volume of pores (Pr) are showed in Table \n\n5. Although we note an increase in BD after rainfall simulation, which causes a diminishing in \n\nPr, differences were not significant (p > 0.10).  \n\n \n\nTable 5 - Averages of Bulk Density and Ratio of Volume of Pores from quadruplicates of a \n\nFine Rhodic Kandiudalf (22\u00ba41\u201951.5\u201d S, 47\u00ba37\u201953.2\u201d W) at surface (0 - 2.5 cm) \n\nbefore (No-rainfall) and after rainfall simulations (40, 80, 120 mm) \n    No-rainfall 40 mm 80 mm 120 mm \n\nBulk Density \n  (Mg m\n\n-3\n) \n\n \n\n1.20 1.25 1.24 1.24 \n\nRatio of Volume of Pores \n \n\n(m\n3\n m\n\n-3\n) \n\n  0.55 0.53 0.54 0.53 \n\nThere were no differences (p >0.10) between rainfall amounts. \n\n \n\nOne of the difficulties on trying to evaluate soil surface processes is to consider the \n\nscale in which they happen. The depth in which the sealing occurs for this soil is very narrow, \n\nas discussed in section 2.3.4. When observed in the microscope, most of the crusts, even after \n\n120 mm of rainfall, were smaller than 10 mm (i.e. 0.10 cm). Therefore, the height of the \n\ncylinder used for BD measurements had 2.5 times the width of the crust. Bergsma et al. \n\n(2000) cites that a crust can vary from a few millimeters to a maximum of 2 or 3 cm wide. \n\nThis wide variance given by the authors is because their text try to create an international \n\nliterature for soil erosion and conservation studies, which make it reasonable, in a world \n\n\n\n \n \n\n58 \n\nscenario, to consider several classes of soils. As reported before, the soil of this study presents \n\na very stable structure, theme that is going to be explored in section 2.3.2.2. Thus, is \n\nconvenient to infer that the cylinder size was not enough to find differences between rainfall \n\namounts, reason to why it was decided to divide the samples in narrower depths when \n\ncomputing the water retention curves that are showed in section 2.3.3.2. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.2 Aggregates stability \n\nThe aggregates size distribution (ASD) and the weighted mean diameters (WMD) are \n\nshown in Table 6. Differences were not significant (p > 0.10) between rainfall amounts for all \n\npre-treatments, which reflects the high stability of such soil. However, a pattern is observed. \n\nSlow wetting (SW) had a higher concentration of aggregates bigger than 2 mm (903.15, \n\n916.23, 898.98 and 894.31 g kg\n-1\n\n), followed by the values from mechanical breakdown (MB) \n\n(585.29, 594.13, 551.66 and 534.27 g kg\n-1\n\n) and fast wetting (FW) (215.24, 193.83, 223.92 and \n\n184.92 g kg\n-1\n\n). Le Bissonnais (1996) states that it is common to find much smaller values for \n\nFW, since it relates to the slaking of dry soils when they are rapidly moistened (e.g. during \n\ntropical storms common during summer). Since this process is related to the raising pressure \n\ninside aggregates and clods, that may cause several internal ruptures in different parts of the \n\nstructure, it is expected to have a higher degree of dismantlement, after all, it occurs \n\nsimultaneously in several parts of the aggregate. \n\nTwo facts are promptly noted by checking all pre-treatments. First, with regard to the  \n\ndifferences between treatments, all distributions present relatively high WMD. Second, \n\ndifferent distribution patterns occur after each pre-treatment, as can be seen in Figure 13, that \n\nshows the distributions according to equivalent diameters. FW curves covers a wider range of \n\ndiameters, concentrating between 0.75 and 3.5 mm. MB is more concentrated around 1.5 and \n\n3.5 mm, and SW is dominated by aggregates with 3.5 mm of diameter. Although there were \n\nno differences (p > 0.10) amongst rainfall amount, in FW we can better differentiate the \n\ncurves according to rainfall, where 120 mm of rainfall decreases the amount of big \n\naggregates, while increasing the concentration of very small aggregates (&lt;0.053 mm). The \n\ncurves for MB and SW behave similarly according to rainfall amount, being difficult to \n\ndistinguish differences between simulations. \n\nWith this information we can theorize which process is going to be dominant during \n\nclods disruption in this soil according to rainfall. At first, if the soil is dry when rainfall starts, \n\nbig clods will suffer slaking, which will create wider distributions, with sizes reaching from \n\ncentimeters to a few millimeters. When water starts to accumulate and the moisture \n\n\n\n \n \n\n59 \n\nstandardizes at the surface, the breakdown due to raindrop impact will be the dominant \n\nprocess, but not as effective, since most clods remain bigger than 1 mm. The results for SW \n\nshow that almost no clod crumbles when the soil is already humid and water flux is slow. \n\nWhen studying surface roughness in the same area, Castilho et al. (2011) noticed the \n\npersistence of undisrupted random clods even after 10 natural rainfall events (with intensity > \n\n25 mm h\n-1\n\n). This resistance is a natural feature of this class of soil. Brazilian Rhodic \n\nKandiudalfs (SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2014), i.e., Nitossolos Vermelhos eutrof\u00e9rrico \n\n(EMBRAPA, 2013), are known to present high contents of iron oxides, even in silt and sand \n\nfractions (FERREIRA et al., 2003), because of their parental material (basalt). That generates \n\ncohesive bonds that are difficult to break. The cohesive forces of such elements prevents \n\ndispersion by water alone, maintaining the structure stable for longer periods of time. Such \n\nsoils even present a challenge during particles size analysis, since its total dispersion is very \n\ndifficult due to these strong cohesive forces (COR\u00c1 et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Aggregates size distribution at surface (0-10 mm) of a Fine Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No-rainfall) \n\nand after rainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120 mm).

There were \n\nsignificant differences (p &lt;0.10) between rainfall amounts and between tensions. K(?) was \n\nalmost always significantly bigger at 1.5 cm, that represent pores with equivalent diameter of \n\n1.98 mm. At 40 mm of rainfall, for all tensions, K(?) drops almost to one third of its initial \n\nvalue in all tensions, which does not significantly change with increasing rainfall. In 40 mm \n\ndifferences between tensions starts to fade, with no significant differences between tensions of \n\n1.5 and 3 cm. At 120 mm of rainfall there were no significant differences (p > 0.10) between \n\nall tensions. That means that with increasing rainfall the reorganization of the pores close to \n\nthe surface causes a drastic change in the structure, probably standardizing pore sizes to a \n\nsmaller equivalent diameter.  \n\n \n\nTable 7 \u2013 Values of unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity at surface from a Rhodic \n\nKandiudalf before (No rainfall) and after rainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120 \n\nmm).

Instead, rainfall caused pronounced changes in macropores bigger than 0.66 mm. \n\nHence, changes in soil hydraulic conductivity from pores with equivalent diameter between \n\n0.66 and 1.98 mm may be related to changes in their size distribution, which would be \n\nreflected in the beginning of the water retention curve (WRC), and/or to changes in pores \n\nshape and connectivity, that can be evaluated by micromorphometrical analysis. \n\n \n\n2.3.3.2 Water Retention Curve \u2013 WRC \n\nIn Figure 14 is possible to observe differences in average WRCs by rainfall amount and \n\ndepth of measurement. There is a general decreasing in the dispersion of points with \n\nincreasing rainfall, which is related to the homogenization of the structure within each \n\n\n\n \n \n\n62 \n\ntreatment. The curves show that rainfall causes differences in all three layers with increasing \n\namount. However, main distinction occur at the superficial layer. In all rainfall amounts, the \n\ncurves at surface stay beneath others (middle and subsurface) for most potentials (showed in \n\npF, i.e., log10|-h| cm). \n\nBefore rainfall, all curves presented similar shape and were closer to one another. This \n\nindicates that before rainfall the structure does not change from surface till the depth of 2.4 \n\nmm. We can verify that by checking the WRC fitted parameters in Table 8. There are no \n\ndifferences between layers before rainfall for ?s (1.00, 1.00 and 1.00 kg kg\n-1\n\n) and ?r values \n\nare very close (0.14, 0.08 and 0.12 kg kg\n-1\n\n). Equality between ?s values shows that there is \n\nhomogeneity in the part of the curve that represent structural pores. The ?r is more affected by \n\nthe inclination of the curve, since it depends on the location of the inflection point at a lower \n\npotential (van GENUCHTEN, 1980), which shows when the porosity changes from structural \n\nto textural (DEXTER, 2004a). This can be observed by the ? and n parameters. Parameter ? \n\npresented a little increase on the middle curve (1.98, 2.48 and 1.31) while n presented a small \n\ndecrease (1.30, 1.21 and 1.27). The parameter ? is related to the position of the inflection \n\npoints, while n to the steepness of the curve (van GENUCHTEN, 1980). Higher ? indicates \n\ninflections closer to the end of the curve, i.e. higher percentage of structural pores, and lower \n\nn relates to smaller gradients  ?/ h, which is typical of curves that are less steep. Since the \n\nshape and ?s and ?r are very similar, there is no reason to consider differences between curves \n\nbefore rainfall. \n\nAfter 40 mm of rainfall, the curves of deeper layers (middle and subsurface) presented a \n\ndifferent curvature when compared to the surface. Just with one rainfall there were changes in \n\n?s (1.00, 0.49 and 0.49 kg kg\n-1\n\n) and a positive linear behavior of ?r (0.16, 0.18 and 0.19 kg \n\nkg\n-1\n\n). It is easy to imagine that rainfall would decrease ?s at surface, due structural changes \n\ncaused by sealing. However, values of ? (3.13, 0.06 and 0.03) and n (1.34, 1.64 and 1.83) \n\nshow that deeper layers suffered more changes with the first application of simulated rainfall. \n\nThe increase in steepness (i.e. increasing n) and decrease of structural porosity (i.e. decrease \n\nof ?), along with a linear increase in ?r, may point to an increase in clay content due to \n\nilluviation from the upper layer. The clay padding would explain the reduction of ?s. \n\nImagining that structural pores are the first to be filled, a decrease of ? would also be \n\nplausible, and it is noteworthy that an increase in clay content would explain the rising of ?r. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Average water retention curves from a Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No-rainfall) and after rainfall \n\nsimulations (40, 80 and 120 mm). Averages calculated from quadruplicate soil cylinders (2.5 x 2.5 \n\ncm) collected by rainfall amount. Each cylinder was divided in three parts (0.8 x 2.5 cm) to \n\ncapture the transitions caused by soil sealing. Depths represent layers very close to soil actual \n\nsurface (surface, 0 - 0.8 mm), an intermediate layer between parts that can be affected by sealing \n\nand the soil original structure (middle, 0.8 \u2013 1.6 mm) and the layer less directly affected by rainfall \n\n(subsurface. 1.6 \u2013 2.4 mm) \n \n\nAt 80 mm all curves are once again very similar in shape and more superimposed. \n\nNevertheless, they are less steep and displaced downward when compared to before rainfall, \n\nindicating a loss of structural porosity. Although ranges between ?s (1.00, 0.60 and 0.54 kg \n\nkg\n-1\n\n) and ?r (0.17, 0.16 and 0.17 kg kg\n-1\n\n) is larger than it was after 40 mm of rainfall, ? values \n\n(1.46, 0.20 and 0.08) are smaller at surface and n values are very similar (1.40, 1.38 and 1.43), \n\ncorroborating the less steep shape. \n\nAfter 120 mm of rainfall there are profound differences between layers, with three very \n\ndistinct curves. There is a huge difference between the values of ?s (0.37, 0.43 and 0.45 kg \n\nkg\n-1\n\n), while ?r (0.17, 0.18 and 0.19 kg kg\n-1\n\n) remains very close. This represents an immense \n\ndifference in structure between the three layers, since at surface the soil retains 0.08 kg kg\n-1\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n64 \n\nless than at subsurface. Although the surface layer is the most degraded, changes occur  at all \n\ndepths, since low ? values (0.02, 0.03 and 0.03) and high n values (10, 3.32 and 3.85) shows a \n\ncomplete change in soil behavior, with values very similar to ones found for sandy soils (van \n\nGENUCHTEN, 1980), where the lack of aggregation leads to more steep curves, with \n\ninflection occurring right at the beginning of the curve, at higher potentials. \n\n \n\nTable 8 \u2013 Parameters from average water retention curves of a Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No-\n\nrainfall) and after rainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120 mm).

This shows that the sealing process is not completely linear from surface to the \n\nunderlying layers. Instead, changes occurs at different amounts at each depth, depending on \n\nwhich process is dominant at surface. For example, if clay dispersion is dominant, deeper \n\nlayers will suffer faster changes than the overlying soil. If slaking and/or mechanical break \n\nstarts to rearrange clods, the surface presents more changes.  \n\nSince K(?) presents great changes right after the first rainfall, and curves at surface \n\nchange gradually across rainfall amount, other features must be changing to impede water \n\nmovement. The WRC shows structural differences related to retentions characteristics, that \n\nmay be extrapolated to pores size distribution if bulk density is known. However, soil \n\nconductivity does not only depends on pore sizes, but also on its shape, tortuosity and \n\n\n\n \n \n\n65 \n\nconnectivity. Shape and connectivity can be easily estimated by micromorphometrical \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Image Pore Analysis \n\n2.3.4.1 Micromorphometrical analysis \n\nThe distribution of the percentage of area of pores by format and size are presented in \n\nTable 9. A graphical representation can be found in Figure 15. Independently of the rainfall \n\namount and depth, the dominant class of pores was the complex with diameters larger than \n\n1000 \u00b5m. This type of pore is associated to the degree of connectivity in a pore system. The \n\ndefinition of \u201ccomplex\u201d is an allusion to the difficulty to define such pores based on a unique \n\ndiameter value, since they are not circular or elongated. Thus, complex pores are normally \n\nmore ramified, and bigger this pore is, higher is the chance of connectivity throughout the \n\nsystem. At the same time that complex pores (> 1000 \u00b5m) dominated, they changed (p &lt;0.10) \n\nwith the rainfall volumes applied on the surface layer, with a decrease in area from 35.360 %, \n\nbefore rainfall, to 20.308 % after 120 mm of rainfall. The fact that this happened only at the \n\nsurface is associated to the sealing process, which modifies the soil structure only at the first \n\nfew millimeters of the soil surface. On the other hand, the average of this class of pores was \n\nlarger at the 40 mm rainfall than before rainfall,  but the differences were not significant, \n\nwhich is evidently related to the high variability within this treatment. Analogously to the \n\nsurface roughness discussion, initial rainfall increases variability within the soil, instead of \n\nstandardizing it due to clod disruption, especially considering the high stability of the \n\naggregates of this soil. The more stable parts will disrupt less, so at the beginning of the \n\nrainfall event the variability increases, until soil moisture standardizes, and the structure at the \n\nsurface starts to breakdown. \n\nThe smaller area occupied by complex pores (> 1000 \u00b5m) was followed by an increase \n\nin the area of smaller size pores, such as smaller complex (500 \u2013 1000 \u00b5m and 100 - 200 \u00b5m) \n\nand elongated (20 - 50 \u00b5m) types. Rounded pores did not present differences (p > 0.10) for all \n\nsizes within the soil surface among rainfalls. This may be associated to the very small area \n\ncovered by such pores and the high variability of the pore systems. Analyzing the behavior of \n\nthe means, an increase of almost all rounded pores as rainfall volume increases can be \n\nobserved. This may show that the pore structure is becoming less and less connected. \n\nWhen comparing depths at the same rainfall volume it is interesting to note that, before \n\nrainfall, there is practically no differences (p > 0.10) between layers, meaning that the whole 5 \n\ncm layer is homogeneous. The biggest differences between depths are observed at the 80 mm \n\n\n\n \n \n\n66 \n\nvolume of rainfall, with all complex pores from 100 to 1000 \u00b5m decreasing as depth \n\nincreases. Although changes by rainfall occur mainly at the surface, the accumulative rainfall \n\ncan cause a collapse of the structure due to increase moistening, which weakens cohesive \n\nbonds, thanks to the lubricant action of water. This favors the increase of the bulk density in \n\ndeeper layers, which might be confused with crust formation. We can infer that this is not the \n\ncase here, since the distribution of rounded pores decreases, which is the contrary of what \n\nhappen in a sealed layer, where the area of rounded pores rises due to fragmentation of big \n\ncomplex and elongated pores.

Results are averages from quadruplicate soil blocks \n\nhaving triplicate images within rainfall amount and depth of measurement. Images were taken, \n\nparallel to the real surface of the soil, for three depths,: surface (0-10 mm), middle (20- 30 mm) and \n\nsubsurface (40 \u2013 50 mm) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n69 \n\nAnother important factor, that must be take into account in the discussion of pore \n\nconnectivity, is the number of pores. For example, if a soil has a high percentage of area \n\ncovered by complex pores with diameter larger than 1000 \u00b5m, but these are divided into 100 \n\nunits, it is easy to understand that this pore system would be little connected when compared \n\nto one with same area but represented by only 10 units. The idea of connectivity is important \n\nin a conservationist point of view, since it allows the soil to infiltrate and percolate water \n\nmore easily and faster, increasing the initiation time and diminishing the volume of runoff. \n\nThe number of pores by type and size are found in Table 10 and the graphical \n\nrepresentation is in Figure 16. Again differences (p &lt;0.01) between rainfall amounts occurred \n\nonly at the surface, with an increase of the number of complex (200 \u2013 400 \u00b5m and 500 \u2013 1000 \n\n\u00b5m), elongated (20 \u2013 50 \u00b5m) and rounded (50 \u2013 100 \u00b5m) pores. As stated in the area of pores \n\ndiscussion above, the fact that the area of big complex pores was significantly diminished and \n\ndivided between the types cited above (smaller complex, elongated and rounded pores), one \n\ncan infer that rainfall is indeed decreasing connectivity at the surface, attributing this to the \n\nsoil surface sealing process. We note that several size classes are empty, which make it \n\nplausible to summarize them into broader size classes to facilitate interpretation. In Table 11, \n\nand Figure 17 and Figure 18, we find the same dataset divided into three size classes (large, \n\nmedium and small). Some differences (p &lt;0.10) are not observed as before, especially \n\nbecause variances within each class are increased. However, the average presented in each \n\ncondensed class has similar behavior as to the one of the previous classes. At the surface, \n\nthere is a linear decrease of large complex pores with rainfall increase, followed by a \n\nsignificant (p &lt;0.01) increase in the area of medium complex, medium elongated, small \n\nelongated and small rounded pores. Differences (p &lt;0.10) between depths occur primarily \n\nafter 80 mm of rainfall. Number of pores at the surface increase (p &lt;0.10) substantially with \n\nrainfall volume, especially the small rounded ones. Important to note that, after 120 mm of \n\nrainfall, the number of pores in several classes is bigger (p &lt;0.10) then the one at the same \n\nrainfall in a deeper layer. This shows how significantly the structure has changed at surface \n\ndue to sealing. \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 10 - Distribution of number of pores by format and size in a Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No-rainfall) and after rainfall simulations (40, 80 \n\nand 120 mm).

At surface, \n\nthe spectrum after 120 mm of rainfall presents the minimum f(?) at both left and right side, \n\nand also the wider ? range, which could mean that sealing causes an increase on the \n\nfragmentation of the pore system, with big pores becoming less frequent along the system (i.e. \n\nsmaller f(?) at left side) at same time small pores become more frequent, since this is the only \n\ntreatment that presents a right spectrum side. In the subsequent layer, after the first rainfall (40 \n\nmm) the pores became less fragmented, reaching higher f(?) values for most part of the \n\nspectra. At subsurface all treatments were much more similar. All rainfall amounts induced a \n\nmore fragmented left side, indicating that big pores distribution did not change at this layer \n\nwith increasing rainfall. At the same time, the spectrum before rainfall had a wider right side, \n\nwhich could mean that, for this treatment, small pores are more equally distributed along \n\nscales. Other interpretations are difficult to be made only by a visual approach. Thus, we now \n\ntake our attention to the parameters contained in Table 12. \n\n \n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Multifractal spectra of area of pores from a Fine Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No rainfall) and after \n\nrainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120 mm), obtained from the average of triplicate images of \n\nquadruplicates blocks of soil. Soil blocks were impregnated and images taken in three depths, \n\nparallel to the real surface of the soil: surface (0-10 mm), middle (20- 30 mm) and subsurface (40 \u2013 \n\n50 mm) \n\nAt surface, differences (p &lt;0.10) with rainfall increase occurred positively for D0-D1, \n\nD0-D2, D1-D2, L?f(?) and ?L?, and negatively for Lf(?)min and ?min. D1 is the entropy \n\ndimension, following the information entropy definition (SHANNON; WEAVER, 1949). \n\nThus, D1 represents the heterogeneity of the system (MART\u00cdNEZ et al., 2009), since it \n\nmeasures the decrease in information as the box size increase during the box-counting \n\n\n\n \n \n\n76 \n\nanalysis (POSADAS et al., 2003). A decrease in D1 when compared to D0, i.e., an increase in \n\nD0-D1, implicates an increase in heterogeneity. As mentioned in the soil roughness \n\ndiscussion section, D2 represents the correlation of the measure contained in a L size box \n\n(POSADAS et al., 2003). Therefore, a decrease in D2 with regard to D0, i.e., D0-D2, \n\nimplicates diminishing correlation, and in comparison to D1, i.e., D1-D2, means that \n\ncorrelation drops faster than the rate in which information is lost. Rainfall caused an increase \n\nin heterogeneity, noted by D0-D1 (0.07, 0.07, 0.09 and 0.10), and a decrease in correlation \n\nmarked by D0-D2 (0.15, 0.14, 0.21 and 0.21). The fact that D0 did not change significantly \n\nshows that the system\u2019s average is not altered, which would mean that all changes are related \n\nto the displacement between small and big pores distributions, without big changes in the total \n\narea of pores. This agrees with the summarized micromorphometrical results, where, while no \n\ndifferences (p > 0.10) were found for area of pores on most of the sizes (large, medium and \n\nsmall) and classes (complex, elongated and rounded), there were several differences (p &lt;\n\n0.10) in the number of pores, indicating an increase in the fragmentation of the porosity with \n\nrainfall increase. \n\nRainfall also increased D1-D2 intervals (0.07, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.11). While large \n\ncomplex pores decreased most in area, the increase in the number of pores was more \n\npronounced for the class of small rounded ones, going from 424 before rainfall, to 662 after \n\n120 mm (Table 11). Considering the creation of new rounded pores from the collapse of big \n\ncomplex pores as spatial dependent, and that spots where the structure is weaker are going to \n\nfade more easily and faster than others, we can imagine that the final geometry of the pore \n\nsystem is going to be unequally distributed. Therefore, correlation between different regions \n\nwould drop fast with increasing rainfall. In contrast, D1 gives the probability of pore \n\noccupation of the ith L size box without considering the way they are distributed (V\u00cdDAL \n\nVAZQUEZ et al., 2008). Thus, even if information loss along scales is affected by rainfall, \n\nany geometrical distribution would promptly affect D2, making it to drop faster than D1. \n\nVidal V\u00e1zquez et al. (2008) also used the multifractal formalism to evaluate changes caused \n\nby rainfall, but with regard to the pores size distribution obtained by Hg porosimetry. Their \n\nresults were very similar for D1, D0-D1 and Lf(?)min. However, their differences for D2 were \n\nnot significant (p &lt;0.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nTable 12 \u2013 Multifractal parameters calculated from area of pores of a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No-rainfall) and after rainfall simulations \n\n(40, 80 and 120 mm), obtained from the average of triplicate images of quadruplicates blocks of soil.

The left side shows \n\nthe Hausdorff dimensions and the Lipschitz-Holder exponents related to the large pores. A \n\ndecrease in Lf(?)min indicates an increase on the fragmentation of large pores, which was \n\ndiscussed before considering D1 and D2. The decrease of ?min was followed by the increase of \n\n?L?, i.e., there was no displacement of ?(f(?)max). This shows that the scale relation for the \n\nfragmentation of large pores has also changed. Narrower ? ranges are related to more \n\nhomogeneous pore systems (POSADAS et al. 2003; VIDAL V\u00c1ZQUEZ et al., 2010), where, \n\nsometimes, D0 is enough to represent the whole system. Increasing ?L? followed by a \n\ndecrease in Lf(?)min indicate that larger pores were fragmented into smaller pores, which are \n\ndistinguished from the previous class by featuring a distinct degree of fractality, i.e., a \n\ndifferent Hausdorff dimension.  \n\nWhen  we examine the middle layer, more differences (p &lt;0.10) are noted: D0, D1, D2, \n\nRf(?)min, Lf(?)min, R?f(?), f(?)ratio, ?min, ?max, ?R? and ?ratio. However, these differences look \n\nrandom at first, i.e., they do not follow a trend across rainfall amount. Nevertheless, this is \n\nfurther evidence that, during the sealing process, changes do occur at deeper layers, even if it \n\nis difficult to find a pattern. What we note is that, instead of a linear trend, most differences \n\noccur after the first rainfall (40 mm). D0, D1 and D2 reach their maximum after this rainfall \n\namount. As explained before, D1 and D2 increase implicates in a decrease in information loss \n\nover scales and an increase in correlation between different regions of the measure, \n\nrespectively. Posadas et al. (2003) found high correlations between D0 and total area of pores. \n\nSince D0 is the average Hausdorff dimension of the system, which represents the underlying \n\nfragmentation process, this is expected to happen. The middle layer had a much higher \n\npercentage of pores area after 40 mm of rainfall (46.45 %) when compared to other treatments \n\n(32.25, 39.96 and 34.40 %). \n\nMany other parameters follow the same behavior, by peaking (Lf(?)min, f(?)ratio, ?min and \n\n?ratio) after 40 mm of rainfall. In contrast, Rf(?)min decreases with rainfall input, reaching its \n\nminimum after 120 mm of rainfall. Rf(?)min is the Hausdorff dimension, i.e. the fragmentation \n\nindex, of very small pores. Thus, a decreasing Rf(?)min indicate a reduction of the contribution \n\nof small pores, i.e., the area of small pores is reduced. This corroborates in parts the \n\nmicromorphometrical data, since smaller Rf(?)min after 40 mm of rainfall (1.82, 1.71, 1.77 and \n\n1.68) is paired with smaller area covered by small elongated  (0.04, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04) and \n\nrounded (1.52, 0.94, 1.09 and 1.37) pores. In the case of 120 mm, even if the area of these \n\n\n\n \n \n\n79 \n\nclasses of pores increase when compared to 80 mm, we note that the number of pores in such \n\nclasses also increase, which also interferes in the fragmentation of the system. \n\nAt the deepest layer (subsurface) two parameters of the left side of the spectra presented \n\ndifferences (p &lt;0.10) with rainfall increase (D1-D2, L?f(?)). However attentions must be \n\npaid to the significance of the differences for qmin values. While differences were significant \n\n(p &lt;0.10) for qmin in all layers, two facts contributed to the lack of discussion of this \n\nparameter in other depths. First, differences were less pronounced at surface and middle, with \n\nranges of 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, than at subsurface, ranging 0.4. Secondly, the magnitude \n\nand order of parameters from the left side did not always accompanied the differences \n\nbetween qmin values at upper layers. For example, at surface, the minimum Lf(?)min was 1.78, \n\neven with when L?f(?) was the shortest.  \n\nConsidering this last statement, is important to remember that fragmentation is a \n\nmeasure of two things: the filling capacity of a process, i.e., larger the area covered by the \n\nobject, larger its Hausdroff dimension is; and the degree of brokenness, i.e. more divided the \n\nobject is in the system, smaller its Hausdroff dimension is. The results above for the porosity \n\nof a Rhodic Kandiudalf, measured by two-dimensional image analysis, seems to demonstrate \n\nthat most multifractal parameters are associated not only to the area of pores, but also to the \n\nnumber of pores at each level of size and shape. \n\nThe differences (p &lt;0.10) between depths within each rainfall amount show that the \n\nsurface had higher values when compared to the underlying layers of soil, for all the left side \n\nparameters, while the contrary holds for some parameters of the right side. Most of the time, \n\nthe middle layer was the opposite of the surface. For example, while D0, D1 and D2 had the \n\nhighest values at surface before rainfall (1.93,1.86 and 1.80), the middle had the lowest (1.89, \n\n1.80 and 1.72), while the subsurface got intermediate values (1.89,01.81,1.74). This just \n\nindicates that, at surface, the area of big pores was higher during all rainfalls, which \n\ncorroborates some of the micromorphometrical results. The middle layer works as a transition \n\nbetween a very opened surface, i.e. a layer with high percentage of pores, to a mild \n\nfragmented subsurface. When rainfall starts to act on the soil, transformations seems to be \n\nmore pronounced in this transition, especially on the right side of the spectrum. This means \n\nthat, although this layer has smaller pores, those are less stable than the ones at the surface, \n\nsince particles tend to close more the pores at this layer than at surface. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n80 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n81 \n\n3 CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe multifractal spectra is sensitive to structure changes caused by rainfall. Considering \n\nthe soil surface roughness, the multifractal parameterization is useful to evaluate \n\nmodifications, caused by rainfall, on very fine scales. However, for the soil of this study, it is \n\nnot possible to use the multifractal approach in datasets with resolutions coarser than 10 mm, \n\nsince a pattern could not be found in such scale, i.e., MRM. There seems to be a relation \n\nbetween decreasing grid resolution and increase in randomness of heights, since other \n\nclassical index, i.e., RRi, also could not distinguish changes provoked by rainfall. The \n\nmultifractal behavior of this soil is not distinguishable (p &lt;0.10) between measurements \n\nmade at minimum resolutions of 0.074 mm and 0.5 mm. Therefore, is more convenient to use \n\nthe device that work closer to the upper part of this range, i.e., MLT, for two reasons: its \n\nlower cost and greater area coverage. Considering the area and number of pores, obtained by \n\nmicromorphometrical techniques, the multifractal behavior changed according to sealing \n\ndevelopment and depth of measurement, being sensitive to the changes in the pores size \n\ndistribution and their fragmentation degree within each size class. Whereas this soil presents \n\ndominant complex pores across rainfall amounts and layers, it is not possible to correlate any \n\nspectra parameter to pores shape modification. \n\nSome multifractal parameters are suitable for modeling steps of soil surface degradation \n\nby rainfall. The Hausdorff dimensions at the left side of the spectrum are the parameters most \n\nsensitive to physical changes related to rainfall erosion. Lf(?)min, L?f(?) and D2 were the \n\nparameters that often showed a linear behavior with increasing rainfall amount, considering \n\nboth surface roughness and area of pores measurements. However, D2 from porosity was not \n\ndifferent (p > 0.10) along rainfall amounts at surface. In this case, D0-D1, D0-D2 and D1-D2 \n\npresented as parameters that could be used to describe the changes in the pore system.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n82 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n83 \n\nREFERENCES \n\nANDERSLAND, O.B.; WIGGERT, D.C.; DAVIES, S.H.
