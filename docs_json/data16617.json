Among the over 50\nspecimens collected until now, the only occurrences not\nbelonging to this group are a small archosaur (probably\n\n02_Art01_Reichel.pmd 28/11/2005, 14:20173\n\n\n\nREVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 8(3), 2005174\n\nrelated to Rhadinosuchus, according to Machado &amp; Kischlat,\n2003), found in Schoenstatt outcrop, and an indeterminate\ntusked dicynodont, found in Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova outcrop.\nThis dominance of cynodonts does not occur in any other\noutcrop of the Santa Maria Formation. Besides, some\ncynodonts identified from the Schoenstatt outcrop, including\nCharruodon (Abdala &amp; Ribeiro, 2000) and Santacruzodon\n(Abdala &amp; Ribeiro, 2003), are distinct from those already\ndescribed for the two biozones established for the Santa Maria\nFormation: the Therapsid Biozone (Mesotriassic) and the\nRhynchosaur Biozone (Neotriassic) (Scherer et al, 1995;\nSchultz et al., 2000). Thus, Abdala et al. (2001), proposed a\nnew biozone, the Traversodontidae Biozone, for the fossil\nassemblage found at that outcrop, which should be\npositioned between those cited above.\n\nLucas (2001) argued that the occurrence of the new fauna\nwas much restricted (only at the Schoenstatt outcrop) and\nthe new cynodont taxa do not represent a distinct stage of\nevolution related to those cynodonts from the underlying\nTherapsid Biozone (Dinodontosaurus Biozone of Lucas, 2001)\nto support the establishment of a distinct biozone, so that he\nincluded the Schoenstatt outcrop and its fauna in his\nDinodontosaurus Biozone.\n\nIn this study, we analyze the diagenetic pattern of the\nfossil bones from the Traversodontid Biozone, including the\nSchoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova outcrops and also com-\npare the data obtained from these two outcrops with those\ncoming from other known outcrops belonging to the other\nbiozones of the Santa Maria Formation. Our goal is to deter-\nmine if, from a diagenetic point of view, the Schoenstatt and\nthe Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova outcrops constitute a distinct level\nwithin the Middle-Upper Triassic sequence of Brazil.\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING AND LOCATION OF\nTHE OUTCROPS\n\nThe outcrops of Schoenstatt (Santa Cruz do Sul city, UTM\n359767 E, 6709062 N) and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova (Ven\u00e2ncio Aires\ncity, UTM 394997 E, 6720253 N) (Figures 1 to 3) are composed\nof decimetric layers of massive red mudstones, alternated\nwith amalgamated lenticular bodies of fine sandstones. These\nrepresent the typical association of the Alemoa Member of\nthe Santa Maria Formation. The age attributed to this unit is\nLadinian to Eonorian, based mainly on its paleotetrapods\n(Scherer et al., 2000).\n\nThe materials used for comparisons (Table 1) were collected\nin the Sanga Pinheiros outcrop, in Candel\u00e1ria city (UTM 331263\nE, 6705014 N) and in the Faixa Nova outcrop, in Santa Maria\ncity (UTM 229955 E, 6711041 N), in red mudstones and fine-\ngrained sandstones of Ladinian-Carnian age (Figure 1).\n\nThe Santa Maria Formation tetrapod fauna has been\ndivided into two units: the Therapsid Biozone, of Ladinian\nage and the Rhynchosaur Biozone, of Carnian age (Schultz\net al., 2000; Figure 4). The names indicate that the inferior\nzone is dominated by the presence of therapsid synapsids,\nespecially the herbivorous dicynodont Dinodontosaurus,\nwhile the hyperodapedontid rhynchosaurs (Diapsida,\n\nArchosauromorpha) dominate the upper one. The\nchronostratigraphic datum for the Rhynchosaur Biozone is a\nradiometric age of 227 My. obtained at the basis of the\nIschigualasto Formation from Argentina (Rogers et al., 1993),\nin which the same rhynchosaurs occur. Therapsid non-\nmammalian cynodonts occur both in Therapsid and\nRhynchosaur Biozones, but are represented by distinct taxa\nin each one of them (Abdala et al., 2001).\n\nThe Traversodontid Biozone fills the hiatus between the\nTherapsida and Rhynchosauria Biozones, corresponding to\nthe Neoladinian, as proposed by some authors (Scherer et\nal., 1995, Schultz et al., 1994, 2000; Figure 4).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThe material studied (Table 1) consists of bone fragments\nof cynodonts collected from the Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia\nNova outcrops, which belong to the collection of the\nPaleontology and Stratigraphy Department of the Universida-\nde Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). In both outcrops\nthe bones are disarticulated, sometimes fragmented or crushed,\nprobably due to trampling. There is no evidence of selective\ntransport, nor a preferential bone orientation, which confirms\nthe absence of hydraulic influence on the distribution of the\nbones. All the bones occur in a pelitic matrix, which formed in\na low-energy environment (Machado, 2004).\n\nThe materials collected in Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia\nNova outcrops are macroscopically very similar, with a thin\nand darkned layer covering all the bones. The absence of\nsignificant volumetric changes in the bones from these\noutcrops also becomes evident when compared to the\n\nFigure 1. Map showing the geographic location (arrows) of the\nstudied outcrops: 1, Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova; 2, Schoenstatt; 3, Sanga\nPinheiros; 4, Faixa Nova.\n\n02_Art01_Reichel.pmd 28/11/2005, 14:20174\n\n\n\n175REICHEL ET AL. \u2013 DIAGENETIC PATTERN OF FOSSILS FROM THE TRAVERSODONTIDAE BIOZONE\n\nmaterials from other localities of South Brazilian Triassic (e.g.\nthose pictured by Holz &amp; Schultz, 1998 from Therapsid and\nRhynchosaur Biozones).\n\nIn order to compare diagenetic patterns among different\nstratigraphic levels within the Santa Maria Formation, the\nfossils from Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova were\nconfronted, with those coming from the Therapsid and\nRhynchosaur Biozones (referred by Holz &amp; Schultz, 1998).\nThin sections and respective fossil bones from dicynodonts\n(5 specimens) and rhynchosaurs (18 specimens) were used.\nFrom these, one specimen of dicynodont (thin section UFRGS\nPV0969T) and two of rhynchosaurs (thin sections UFRGS\nPV0970T and UFRGS PV0298T) were selected to be analyzed\nin detail. The thin section UFRGS PV0969T was analyzed by\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as described below.\nThe samples were separated into groups according to their\norigin: Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova, Schoenstatt, Sanga Pinheiros and\nFaixa Nova outcrops (Table 1).\n\nAn impregnation technique, adapted from Timm (1996),\nwas applied to some bone samples in order to prepare them\nas thin sections for histological analysis under optical\nmicroscope (Figures 6 - 8). Another technique applied in this\nstudy was X-Ray diffractometry (XRD), using macerated\nmaterials. This technique characterizes the diagenetic pro-\ncesses that occurred at those paleoenvironments through\nthe identification of the minerals present both in the bones\nand the surrounding matrix (Table 2). XRD analyses were\nperformed with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using Cu K\u00e1\nradiation with generator conditions of 40 kV, 20 mA, with a\nstep size of 0.020 2q and a time step of 1 s.\n\nSome of the sections were also analyzed by SEM. The\nsamples selected were from Schoenstatt (M7), Vila Est\u00e2ncia\nNova (M9), and Sanga Pinheiros (one of thin sections used\nby Holz &amp; Schultz, in 1998, UFRGS PV0969T), representing\nthe Therapsid Biozone. All these samples were coated with\ncarbon. Qualitative and semi-quantitative chemical analyses\n\nwith Electron Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDS) were made in\nselected spots in each sample (Figure 9). Each spot was\nphotomicrographed (Figure 10).\n\nRESULTS\n\nOptical microscopy\nObservation under an optical microscope indicated that\n\nall the bones collected in Shoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova\nhave an equally poor histological preservation due to the\ndissolution of the bone tissue. This state of preservation\nprecludes the identification of preserved bone structures,\nwith the exception of some minor walls of the trabecular bone\nand also little fragments of lamellar bone (Figure 6). On the\nother hand, in most of the fossil bones from the Therapsid\nand Rhynchosaur Biozones (Holz &amp; Schultz, 1998) it is\npossible to observe more histological structures preserved\n(contrasting with the bad external preservation) such as\nalmost complete bone lamellae (Figure 5). The main filling\nminerals in Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova outcrops are\nquartz (Figures 6 - 8), and calcite (Figure 8). The quartz crystals\noccur filling the pores of the bones, forming huge crystals or\njust aggregations of small crystals. In the thin sections from\nfossils from Therapsid and Rhynchosaur Biozones no quartz,\nbut just calcite was found in the bones, between bone\nlamellae, splitting them (Figure 5). Calcite crystals are also\npresent in the bones from Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova,\nbut in much smaller quantity than in those from Therapsid\nand Rhynchosaur Biozones (Holz &amp; Schultz, 1998). In the\nthin sections, the dark layer which macroscopically\ncharacterizes the bones from Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia\nNova (Figures 6 and 8) occurs as well defined dark stains,\nnot only covering the external border of the bones but also\ninside them, generally close to fractures.\n\nX-Ray Diffractometry (XRD)\nThree bone XRD analyses and two matrix XRD analyses\n\nwere made on materials from Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova, while four\nbone analyses and one matrix analysis were made on\nSchoenstatt materials. The results of the analyses are\npresented in Table 2. In all bone samples fluorapatite was\n\nFigure 2. General view of the Schoenstatt outcrop (Santa Cruz\ndo Sul).\n\nTable 1.

Quartz and calcite are also detected in most bone\nsamples, except for the sample UFRGS PV0579T (from\nSchoenstatt), where no calcite was detected and UFRGS\nPV0583T, where no quartz was detected. In all sediment\nsamples quartz was detected.\n\nScanning Electron Microscopy\nFigure 9 shows the percentages of P, Ca and Si found in\n\neach sample. Three analyses were made on materials from\nthe Therapsid Biozone collected in the Sanga Pinheiros\noutcrop (UFRGS PV0969T) and four on materials from the\nTraversodontid Biozone, two from the Schoenstatt (M7) and\ntwo from the Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova (M9) outcrops.\n\nThree kinds of samplings are represented in Figure 9: those\nidentified as \u201cbone\u201d represent EDS analyses of the elements\ndetected in a bone spot. These samples present high\nconcentration of Ca and P (reflecting just the presence of the\nmain constituents of bone hydroxylapatite). The samplings\nidentified as \u201cpore\u201d represent EDS analyses of pores of the\nbones, where diagenetic minerals were accumulated. The third\nkind of sampling, identified as \u201caverage\u201d, represents EDS\nanalyses of spots containing both bone and pore fillings.\n\nIn one of the samples (M9) the dark layer, which covers\nthe external surface of most bones, was also analyzed. An\naverage percentage of 63.62% of Mn was detected, always\nassociated with Ba (in concentrations of nearly 7%). A\nphotomicrograph of this Mn and Ba enriched area was taken\n(Figure 10). Low concentrations of Al (1.35%), Si (3.54%), Cl\n(0.75%) and Ca (1.85%) were detected in the same sampling.\nOn the other hand, in the fossils from Therapsid and\nRhynchosaur Biozones, external layers around the bones are\nmainly represented by Fe oxides (Holz &amp; Schultz, 1998).\n\nIn some isolated samplings of Schoenstatt (M7) other\nelements were detected as Ir (0.96%), Nd (19.94%) and V\n(66.77%).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe study of the morphological and chemical\ncharacteristics of the fossil bones can provide information\nabout environmental conditions during early taphonomic\n\nhistory. It is possible to determine the level of microstructure\npreservation of fossils only after microscopic analyses. All\nthe microanalyses made here showed a poor histological\npreservation of the bones from Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2n-\ncia Nova outcrops, on the contrary of the bones from Faixa\nNova (Therapsid biozone) and Sanga Pinheiros (Rhynchosaur\nbiozone) outcrops, in which the histological preservation is\nbetter in spite of the poor external preservation. The main\npermineralizing minerals in Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova\noutcrops are quartz and calcite and the external dark coloured\nlayer is composed of Mn oxides and Ba. Comparing these\ndata to samples from Rhynchosaur and Therapsid biozones\n(Figure 9 \u2013 UFRGS PV0969T and observation of other thin\nsections under the optic microscope), where no quartz crystals\nare found, the high quartz (Si) concentrations detected in\nSchoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova become even more\nevident, attributing them an exclusive mineralogic feature.\n\nQuartz filling the pores of bones could result from\npedogenic or phreatic processes in arid environments (Hesse,\n1989). In the case of pedogenic processes, the quartz could\nresult from the precipitation of inorganic silica in the form of\nsilcretes, in a process closely related to soil formation and/or\nweathering (Hesse, 1989). Machado (2004) found some root\nmarks in the Schoenstatt outcrop, which were interpreted as\nevidence of paleosoil. Regarding phreatic processes,\n\nFigure 4.

In both cases the bones act as a nucleus for\nthe silicification when they are not in geochemical equilibrium\nwith Si rich percolant fluids (if previously carbonated, for\nexample). Therefore, they become potential targets for\ndissolution and epigenic substitution by quartz. The process\ncould be incomplete (affecting just a percentage of the fossil,\nwith some calcite remaining). So, it is possible that the\nsilicification process in these fossils has been eodiagenetic\nover a previously carbonated material (also by phreatic or\npedogenic processes, according to Da Rosa et al., 2003).\n\nThe exact mechanism of this switch between quartz/calcite\ndeposition is still poorly understood. It is possible that\nchanges in pH and silica concentrations may have caused\ndissolution of calcite and deposition of silica, or dissolution\nof silica and deposition of calcite (Krauskopf, 1972).\nNevertheless, it is unclear what kind of environmental\nchanges may have caused such geochemical alterations.\n\nIn the material studied low quartz concentrations are\nfound in the bone samplings, demonstrating that this mineral\nconcentrates preferentially in the pores, and not in the bone\nmatrix itself (compare in Figure 9, bone and pore samples,\nfrom Schoenstatt [M7] and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova [M9]). The\nquartz concentration in these samplings is much higher than\nthat present in bones from Sanga Pinheiros (UFRGS PV0969T).\n\nIt is very important to stress that the absence of Ca in the\npore of the Schoenstatt sample analyzed by SEM does not\nindicate the total absence of Ca in all pores, because the\ndiagenetic minerals do not necessarily have a homogeneous\ndistribution inside the fossils. In fact, the presence of calcite\nwas detected for Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova fossils\nby X-Ray Diffractometry (Table 2) and Optic Microscopy\nanalyses (Figure 8).\n\nThe Optic Microscopy analyses (Figures 5 - 8) enable us\nto visualize the real difference between the mineral filling of\nthe bones from the Traversodontid biozone (Schoenstatt and\nVila Est\u00e2ncia Nova outcrops) and the bones from the other\nbiozones. In the Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova outcrops,\n\nFigure 5.

Photomicrograph of a bone from the Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova\noutcrop: A, quartz crystals, B, bone layers, C, manganese.\n\nthe quartz crystals are clear and easily recognizable,\ndemonstrating a different diagenetic pattern between those\noutcrops and those where no quartz crystal was recognized\n(Holz &amp; Schultz, 1998).\n\nThese microscopic analyses demonstrate that there is no\nrelationship between the appearance of the bones and their\nhistological preservation. The same was concluded in a\nmicroscopical analysis of archaeological bones (Garland,\n1989). This author stressed the intimate relationship between\nthe depositional environment and the histological\npreservation of bone tissues. Therefore, the similar\nhistological preservation pattern observed in Schoenstatt\nand Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova samples suggests a correlation\nbetween both the localities studied and their respective\ndepositional environments. In both, the same kind of\ndissolution of bone tissue can be observed. Hard skeletal\nparts dissolution can occur during diagenesis or weathering\ndue to the infiltration of water associated with pH variations\nof the environment. Calcite is dissolved in acid conditions,\n\nFigure 7. Photomicrograph of a bone from the Schoenstatt outcrop:\nA, Quartz crystals.\n\n02_Art01_Reichel.pmd 28/11/2005, 14:20177\n\n\n\nREVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 8(3), 2005178\n\nwhile quartz becomes soluble under alkaline conditions (Holz\n&amp; Sim\u00f5es, 2002). Therefore, the sedimentary environment at\nthe time of the Traversodontid Biozone may have been more\nacidic during the beginning of the fossilization process\n(eodiagenesis), allowing the precipitation of quartz in the\npores of the bones.\n\nGeochemical considerations indicate that the silica\nreleased during weathering of alkali feldspars will not be used\nup completely by the formation of clay minerals, because in\nthe most abundant clay minerals, Si:Al ratios are below 2:1\nwhereas in alkali feldspars ratios are 3:1. During alteration of\nalkali feldspars to clay minerals, silica is left over and from\nthis excess silica quartz can be formed. The solubility of\namorphous silica in water at 25\u00b0C and at a pH below 9 is\nabout 120 ppm SiO\n\n2\n, with silica in solution in the monomeric\n\nform. It has been shown that even from strongly\nundersaturated solutions (concentrations down to 0.5 ppm\nSiO\n\n2\n) silica can be adsorbed by hydroxides of Fe, Al, Mn, Mg\n\nand other elements. So, in natural sedimentary environments,\nthe hydroxides of Fe, Al, Mn, Mg, etc. adsorb silica and thus\nenable the formation of quartz in marine and fresh water\nenvironments (Harder &amp; Flehming, 1970). At this point it is\nimportant to stress the presence of manganese in the fossils\nanalyzed, which may have some influence in the quartz\nconcentration on the outcrops studied.\n\nThe formation of silicic acid (H\n4\nSiO\n\n4\n) in shallow waters or\n\nin the interstitial waters, or in the interstitial water of a\nquartzous sediment (Taguchi et al., 1988), is probably related\nto intense rainfall during early diagenetic stages. This would\nlead to a minor acidification around fossil bones, which could\ncause damage to the bone structure. However, when this\nsilicic acid encounters an alkaline environment, represented\nby a previously carbonated bone, precipitation of silica in\nthe bone pores begins. This could explain why the fossil\nbones from these outcrops present a poor histological\npreservation but keep their original size, preventing the\nvolumetric changes which occur in the bones coming from\nthe other biozones (like those studied by Holz &amp; Schultz in\n\n1998) caused by the expansive growing of calcite crystals\ninside the bones. The silicification of fossils, as an\neodiagenetic process, turns them relatively resistant to any\nother subsequent diagenetic processes (Carson, 1991), as\ncompression or physical distortions.\n\nThe apatite detected in the fossils was identified as\nfluorapatite by the XRD, so that the fossil-bone mineral is\nfrancolite (carbonate fluorapatite), rich in fluorine and carbon\ndioxide. According to Newesely (1989), in vivo bones begin\na crystalographic maturation of the hydroxylapatite with an\ni n c o r p o r a t i o n  o f  F - t o  i t s  s t r u c t u r e  i n  v e r y  l o w\nconcentrations. This substitution may continue during\ndiagenesis, depending on the conditions of the environment.\nDahllite (the apatite with F- concentration&lt;1%), which\noccurs in in vivo bones, changes to francolite (the apatite\nwith F- concentration >1%, which was detected by the XRD\nanalyzes). The fluorine does not only substitute the\nhydroxyls (OH- radicals in hydroxylapatites), which can\ncompletely disappear, but also substitutes PO\n\n4\n3- for CO\n\n3\n2-,\n\nwhile the apatite turns into carbonate-fluorapatite (Lucas\n&amp; Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t, 1991). These chemical alterations occur by simple\nionic change. The increase in fluorine concentration during\n\nFigure 10.

The nature of the\nionic substitutions between the bone apatite and the\nsurrounding sediment can also influence the solubility of the\nhydroxylapatite: substitutions involving fluorines decrease\nits solubility, while carbonatic inclusions increase it (Pate et\nal.,1989).\n\nIn the Schoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova outcrops, the\nionic changes between the sediment and the bones studied\nled to the substitutions of OH- by F- (see Table 2, the detection\nof fluorapatite [francolite] by the XRD). Therefore, the\nreduction of the apatite solubility could have contributed to\na better morphological preservation of the bones (in spite of\npoorer histological preservation). The fossils of the Therapsid\nand Rhynchosaur Biozones, which were affected by\ncarbonate solutions, present marked volumetric changes\n(Holz &amp; Schultz, 1998).\n\nNevertheless, the most important factor for the\npreservation of these fossils has not only been the occurrence\nof silica, but the occurrence of silica associated with other\nfactors. The processes that involve the precipitation of silica\ninside the bone pores indicate acid environments, which could\ndamage the bones if they were exposed for a too long time to\nsuch conditions (because the bones could have been\ncompletely dissolved). The presence of calcite increased the\nalkalinity, preventing these excessive acid conditions.\n\nIn this case, even if hydroxylapatite represents the best\ndefined constituent of the inorganic matrix of the bone, it\ndoes not occur in a pure state, nor represents the only\ninorganic phase (Newesely, 1989). This indicates that\ndiagenesis is not a simple process and never depends on\none isolated factor or mineral. Not just the soil and\ngroundwater, but the bone itself has a complex and variable\n\ninorganic composition that contributes to variations of the\ndiagenetic processes. Therefore, strong similarity between\nthe diagenetic patterns of different localities can be very\nuseful for stratigraphic correlation.\n\nMany details can still be explored in the future, including\nthe trace elements detected by SEM analyses (Mn, Ba, V, Nd,\nIr) and their paleoenvironmental implications, leading to a\nmore precise understanding of the relationship between the\noutcrops studied and an understanding of the biology of the\ncollected fossil groups (Williams, 1989; Williams et al., 1997;\nToots &amp; Voorhies, 1965).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe outcrops of Schoenstatt (Santa Cruz do Sul) and Vila\nEst\u00e2ncia Nova (Ven\u00e2ncio Aires) present the same diagenetic\npattern, which is distinct from others within the Santa Maria\nFormation. Both of them present a high percentage of silica\nfilling the bones, while in the other levels (Therapsid and\nRhynchosaur Biozones), silica is absent. It could be observed\nboth in optic microscopy and SEM analyzes. A distinct\nbiostratinomic pattern was also observed for the fossil\nassemblages of these outcrops (Machado, 2004). These\ndiagenetic and biostratinomic patterns, which are shared by\nSchoenstatt and Vila Est\u00e2ncia Nova outcrops and differ from\nthose of the other biozones, reinforce the existence of a\ndistinct biozone for the middle portion of the Santa Maria\nFormation, even if represented by two isolated outcrops.\n\nThe faunal change, observed in the Traversodontid\nBiozone, could be interpreted in this case, as a consequence\nof an environmental change (arid climate, according to Ma-\nchado, 2004), which would produce the distinct sedimentary\nfacies observed in this unit within the Santa Maria\nFormation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Marina B.
