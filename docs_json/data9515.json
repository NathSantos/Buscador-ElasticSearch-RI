To identify tick-borne pathogens among dogs from \nCampo Grande, MS, Brazil testing seropositive for Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi), a serological and molecular \nstudy was conducted to detect Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys and Babesia vogeli in 60 serum and spleen samples. A \nconfirmatory diagnosis of L. infantum based on serological and molecular assays was also performed, as was sequence \nalignment and phylogenetic analysis to assess the identity of the parasite species infecting these animals. IgG antibodies \nto Ehrlichia spp., B. vogeli and L. infantum were found, respectively, in 39 (65%), 49 (81.6%) and 60 (100%) of \nthe sampled dogs. Twenty-seven (45%), fifty-four (90%), fifty-three (88.3%), two (3.3%) and one (1.6%) dog were \npositive, respectively, for E. canis, Leishmania spp., Leishmania donovani complex, Babesia sp. and Anaplasma sp. in \nPCR assays. After sequencing, the amplicons showed 99% of identity with E. canis, B. vogeli, A. platys and Leishmania \nchagasi isolates. The findings of this study indicate that L. infantum-seropositive dogs from Campo Grande are exposed \nto multiple tick-borne pathogens, which should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of dogs with clinical \nsuspicion of leishmaniasis.\n\nKeywords: Ehrlichia canis, Babesia vogeli, Anaplasma platys, Leishmania infantum, dogs, co-infection.\n\nResumo\n\nPat\u00f3genos transmitidos por carrapatos atingem uma variedade de hospedeiros vertebrados.

Vet.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTick-borne pathogens are emerging agents responsible for \ndiseases in both humans and animals worldwide (SHAW\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2001). Ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis and babesiosis are tick-borne \ndiseases of worldwide occurrence in dogs, whose main vector is \nthe brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2003; NAKAGHI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008; OLIVEIRA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008). Dogs \ncan be infected by several agents of the Anaplasmataceae family \n(DUMLER\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2001), such as Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, \nEhrlichia chaffeensis, Anaplasma platys, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, \nNeorickettsia risticii (INOKUMA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2001) and N. helminthoeca \n(HEADLEY\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006).\n\nEhrlichia canis is a common pathogen among domestic dogs \nin Brazil, and is considered primarily responsible for canine \nmonocytic ehrlichiosis (NAKAGHI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008; DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2009). Clinical manifestations of the disease include fever, \nweight loss, anorexia, bleeding disorders and lymphadenopathy \n(CASTRO\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2004; NAKAGHI\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2008). Anaplasma \nplatys, a bacterium that parasitizes platelets, causing canine cyclic \nthrombocytopenia (COHN, 2003), has also been reported in \ndogs in Brazil (DAGNONE\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2009). Furthermore, A. \nphagocytophilum also has been detected molecularly in dogs in the \nstate of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (SANTOS\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). Although \ndogs infected with A. platys and A. phagocytophilum usually present \nmild symptoms or are asymptomatic (HARRUS\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1997; \nKOHN\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008; RAR; GOLOVLJOVA, 2011), some cases \nmay be serious or fatal, particularly when co-infections are involved \n(DANTAS-TORRES, 2008). The confirmation of the occurrence \nof E. ewingii (OLIVEIRA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009) and A. phagocytophilum \n(SANTOS\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011) in dogs from Minas Gerais and Rio de \nJaneiro, respectively, showed that other Anaplasmataceae agents \ncirculate among dogs in Brazil, although the vector tick species \ninvolved in these transmission routes remains unknown.\n\nBabesiosis, which is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the \ngenus Babesia sp., is an emerging disease transmitted to humans \nand animals by ticks (IRWIN, 2009). In Brazil, apart from a single \nreport of B. gibsoni in a dog in the state of Paran\u00e1 (TRAPP\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2006), dogs are more often parasitized by B. vogeli (PASSOS\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2005; FURUTA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009). Clinical manifestations of canine \nbabesiosis are characterized by fever, lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, \npale mucous membranes, splenomegaly, and weight loss. The \nprognosis for diseases caused by piroplasm species is usually good, \nexcept when the disease is caused by B. rossi and B. gibsoni (IRWIN, \n2009; SOLANO-GALLEGO; BANETH, 2011).\n\nVisceral leishmaniasis (VL), an infectious disease that affects \nboth humans and animals, is caused by protozoan parasites of \nthe genus Leishmania, such as Leishmania (Leishmania) donovani \nand Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. The latter is endemic in \nthe New World in regions extending from the southern United \nStates to northern Argentina, including Brazil (KUHLS\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2011). The diagnosis of VL has proved to be problematic, mainly \nbecause of the wide variety of non-specific clinical symptoms, \nincluding a broad spectrum of presentations (BLAVIER\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2001). The immunosuppression observed in VL may promote the \noccurrence of co-infections with other agents such as Ehrlichia, \n\nBabesia, Dirofilaria, Toxoplasma and Neospora in endemic regions \n(FEITOSA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2000; PAULAN\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013). On the other \nhand, a primary infection with tick-borne agents is likely to \nbe a contributing factor to the establishment of canine VL, as \nwas shown for ehrlichiosis in a longitudinal study of naturally \nexposed na\u00efve dogs (MEKUZAS\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009). The present study \naimed to verify the occurrence of E. canis, A. platys and B. vogeli \namong L. infantum-seropositive dogs from Campo Grande in the \nBrazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), using serological and \nmolecular techniques.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nBetween June 2011 and March 2012, serum and spleen samples \nwere collected from 60 L. infantum-seropositive dogs from the \nCenter for Zoonosis Control (CZC) of Campo Grande, Mato \nGrosso do Sul and subjected to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent \nassay (ELISA). Blood samples for the serological tests were drawn \nfrom each dog by cephalic venipuncture and stored without \nanticoagulant (EDTA). During necropsy, fragments of spleen \nwere collected aseptically and stored in absolute ethanol for DNA \nextraction. Additionally, serological and molecular assays were \nperformed for a confirmatory diagnosis of L. infantum.\n\nA Leishmania sp. strain isolated in Ara\u00e7atuba, S\u00e3o Paulo, \nBrazil, characterized as donovani complex, probably L. infantum, \nusing molecular techniques described by Cortes\u00a0et\u00a0al., (2004), was \nused in this study. The parasites were maintained on RPMI-1640 \nmedium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) supplemented with \n10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Canyon \nCity, USA) at 25 \u00b0C and were used to prepare the crude antigens \nfor IFAT and ELISA.\n\nThe ELISA method employed here was described in detail by \nOliveira\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2008). Briefly, 100 mL of crude Leishmania sp. \nantigen diluted in 0.05M sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer \n(pH 9.6) was added to each well on ELISA plates (Nunclon TM \nsurface; Nunc, Denmark) and 5mg mL protein concentration was \nused. After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the plates were washed \nthree times with 0.05% PBS Tween-20. The plates were blocked \nwith 200 mL containing 6% skim milk for 2 hours at 37 \u00b0C to \nreduce nonspecific binding. The blocking agent was removed, \nand individual dog serum diluted (1:400) in PBS Tween-20 \nwith 5% skim milk added to each well, followed by incubation \nfor 90\u00a0minutes at 37 \u00b0C and washing as described above. One \nhundred mL of alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-dog IgG \n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) diluted at 1: 4.000 in PBS \nTween-20 with 5% normal rabbit serum was added to each well, \nfollowed by incubation for 90 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. The plates were \nwashed and the substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate) diluted in \ndiethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, was added. Absorbance at 405 nm \nwas read after 45 minutes of incubation at room temperature, using \nan ELISA reader (Dynex Technologies, USA). The discriminating \nabsorbance value (cut-off) was determined as being 2.5 times the \nmean absorbance value of the negative control.\n\nEhrlichia spp. antigen was obtained from E. canis (Jaboticabal \nstrain)-infected DH82 cells maintained in culture in the \nImmunoparasitology Laboratory of UNESP at Jaboticabal, S\u00e3o \n\n526\n\n\n\nDetection of tick-borne pathogens in dogs from Mato Grosso do Sul\n\nPaulo (AGUIAR\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007). Babesia spp. antigen was prepared \nby intravenous inoculation of B. vogeli (Jaboticabal strain) into a \nsplenectomized three month-old dog negative for hemoparasites \nby PCR and serology (FURUTA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009). Giemsa-stained \nblood smears were examined microscopically twice daily day for \nthe presence of parasites. After peak parasitemia was observed on \nthe fifth day after inoculation, infected blood was collected with \nAlsever\u2019s solution (113.7 mM glucose, 27.2 mM sodium citrate, \n71.8 mM sodium chloride).\n\nSlides containing air-dried fixed B. vogeli trophozoite-\ninfected blood, E. canis-infected DH82 cells and Leishmania \nsp. promastigotes were tested by IFAT (Indirect Fluorescent \nAntibody Test), as described previously (FURUTA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009; \nNAKAGHI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008; OLIVEIRA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008). Antigen slides \nwere removed from storage (?20 \u00b0C) and allowed to thaw at room \ntemperature for 30\u00a0min. Ten microliters of twofold dilutions of \nsera (cut-off of 1:64 for Ehrlichia spp., 1:40 for B. vogeli and 1:40 \nfor L. infantum) were placed in wells on antigen slides. Canine sera \nknown to be positive for E. canis, B. vogeli and L. infantum were \nobtained from symptomatic dogs with ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and \nleishmaniasis treated in the Governador Laudo Natel Veterinary \nHospital of UNESP at Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, and used as positive \ncontrol. Negative control serum samples were obtained from dogs \n(unexposed to these agents, according to negative PCR and IFAT \nresults) that were kept at the kennel of the Department of Veterinary \nPathology of UNESP at Jaboticabal. Slides were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C \nin a moist chamber for 45 min, washed 3 times in PBS (pH\u00a07.2) \nfor 5 min, and air dried at room temperature. FITC-labeled \nanti-dog IgG conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich?, St. Louis, MO, USA) \n\nwas diluted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (dilution \nof 1:32) and added to each well. These slides were incubated again \nat 37\u00a0\u00b0C, washed 3 times in PBS, then in distilled water, and air \ndried at room temperature. Next, coverslips were placed on the \nslides, which were examined under a fluorescence microscope.\n\nDNA was extracted from spleen fragments using the \nQIAamp DNA Blood and Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, \nCalifornia, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \nEach sample of extracted DNA was used as a template in 25 \u00b5L \nof reaction mixture containing 10x PCR buffer, 1.0 mM MgCl2, \n0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs) mixture, and \n1.5\u00a0U Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, \nUSA) with 0.5 \u00b5M of genus specific primers for Ehrlichia spp. \n(16S\u00a0 rRNA\u00a0 gene) (MURPHY\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1998), Anaplasma spp. \n(16S\u00a0 rRNA gene) (MASSUNG\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1998), Babesia spp. \n(18S\u00a0 rRNA\u00a0 gene) (CARRET\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1999), Leishmania spp. \n(kinetoplast DNA) (MICHALSKY\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2002) and L. donovani \ncomplex (CORTES\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004) (Table\u00a01). Positive controls of \nE.\u00a0 canis and B. vogeli DNA samples were obtained from dogs \ninfected experimentally with Jaboticabal strains of E. canis \n(CASTRO\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004) and B. vogeli (FURUTA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009), \nrespectively. A. platys DNA positive control was obtained from a \ndog from Campo Grande, MS naturally infected with A. platys \n(DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009). L. infantum DNA positive control was \nobtained from parasites maintained in culture. Ultrapure sterile \nwater was used as negative control. To prevent PCR contamination, \nthe DNA extraction, reaction setup, PCR amplification and \nelectrophoresis were performed in separate rooms. The reaction \nproducts were purified using a Silica Bead DNA Gel Extraction \n\nTable\u00a01.

Purified amplified DNA \nfragments were subjected in-house to sequence confirmation in an \nautomatic sequencer (ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer\u00a0-\u00a0Applied \nBiosystem/ Perkin Elmer) and used for subsequent phylogenetic \nanalysis. Phylogenetic reconstructions were based on DNA sequence \nalignment of positive samples. Consensus sequences were obtained \nby analyzing the sense and antisense sequences using the CAP3 \nprogram (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgibin/MobylePortal/portal.py). \nComparisons were made with sequences deposited in GenBank \nusing the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST).\n\nResults\n\nIgG antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., B. vogeli and L. infantum \nwere found, respectively, in 39 (65%), 49 (81.6%) and 60 (100%) \nsampled dogs. IFAT titers ranged from 40 to 5120 for B. vogeli, \n64\u00a0to 2048 for Ehrlichia spp. and 40 to 20480 for L. infantum. \nThirty-four dogs (56.6%) showed antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., \nB.\u00a0vogeli, and L. infantum; 6 (10%) dogs were seronegative for \nEhrlichia spp. and B. vogeli, but seropositive for L. infantum. \nFive (8.3%) dogs were seropositive only for Ehrlichia spp. and \nL. infantum; 15\u00a0(25%) were seropositive only for B. vogeli and \nL. infantum, and six (10%) dogs were only seropositive for \nL.\u00a0infantum (Table\u00a02).\n\nTwenty-seven (45%) dogs were positive for E. canis nPCR, \n54 (90%) for Leishmania spp. PCR, 53 (88.3%) for L. donovani \ncomplex PCR, two (3.3%) for Babesia spp. PCR and only one \ndog (1.6%) for Anaplasma spp. nPCR. All 27 E. canis-nPCR \npositive dogs showed antibodies to the agent; 12 (30.7%) out of \n39 Ehrlichia spp -seropositive dogs did not test positive in the \nnPCR assay. Twenty-one (35%) out of 60 sampled dogs were \nnegative for both Ehrlichia spp -IFAT and nPCR. Twenty-three \n(38.3%) dogs were positive for both E. canis and Leishmania spp. \nPCR assays, and 22 (36.6%) for E. canis and L. donovani complex \nPCR assays (Table\u00a02).\n\nOnly one dog was positive for both B. vogeli-IFAT and \nPCR, showing a low titer (40) in IFAT. One dog was positive in \nPCR but negative in IFAT for B. vogeli. Forty-eight (80%) dogs \ntested positive for B. vogeli only in IFAT. Ten (16.6%) dogs were \nnegative for both B. vogeli-IFAT and PCR. One dog (1.6%) was \n\npositive for E. canis nPCR and Babesia spp. PCR, respectively, \nand one animal (1.6%) tested positive in the Leishmania spp., \nL. donovani complex and Babesia spp. PCR assays. One (1.6%) \ndog tested positive in all Anaplasma spp. nPCR, Leishmania spp. \nand L.\u00a0donovani complex PCR assays, and showed antibodies for \nboth B. vogeli and L. infantum (Table\u00a02).\n\nFifty-three dogs (88.3%) tested positive in L. infantum IFAT \nand Leishmania spp. and L. donovani complex PCR assays. Only \none dog was positive for Leishmania spp. PCR and negative for \nL. donovani complex PCR. All 54 Leishmania-PCR positive dogs \nshowed antibodies to this agent; 6 (10%) and 7 (11.6%) out of 60 \nL. infantum-seropositive dogs did not test positive in Leishmania \nspp. and L. donovani complex PCR assays, respectively (Table\u00a02).\n\nAfter sequencing, amplicons obtained in the E. canis nPCR \n(358 pb) showed 99% of identity with sequences of E. canis found \nin dogs from the Philippines (JX893523), Japan (AB723712) and \nTaiwan (GU810149) by BLAST analysis. An amplicon obtained \nafter Anaplasma spp. nPCR (546 pb) showed 99% of identity \nwith sequences of A. platys found in dogs from the Philippines \n(JQ894779), Croatia (JQ396431) and Malaysia (JF683610). \nAmplicons obtained in Babesia spp. PCR (400 pb) showed 99% of \nidentity with sequences of B. vogeli found in dogs from Colombia \n(JN368081), China (HM590440) and Venezuela (DQ297390). \nAmplicons obtained in L. donovani complex PCR (447pb) showed \n99% of identity with the complete sequence of Leishmania infantum \n(syn. L. chagasi) (AF169138, AF103741, AF169139).

Although Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Health \nrecommends serological assays for the diagnosis of L. infantum \n(BRASIL, 2003), cross-reactivity between Trypanosoma cruzi \nand Leishmania braziliensis-infected patients is well documented \nin the serodiagnosis of leishmaniasis (VEXENAT\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1996; \nLUCIANO\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009). In our study, cross-reactivity between \ndog serum samples positive to T. cruzi and L. braziliensis could not \nbe discarded, since the occurrence of T. cruzi and L. braziliensis \namong dogs is documented in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul \n(POMPILIO\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005; SAVANI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009; SOUZA\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2009; CORVALAN\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). One dog that tested positive \nin the Leishmania spp. PCR assay but negative in the PCR assay \nfor L. donovani complex could be infected by other Leishmania \nspp. species, i.e., L. braziliensis or L. amazonensis, which have \nbeen reported previously in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul \n(DORVAL\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006; CORVALAN\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011).\n\nThere are a few reports about the occurrence of Babesia spp. \nin dogs from Campo Grande, MS, which are based only on the \nobservation of piroplasms in blood smears (SALGADO, 2006). \nSerology is a useful tool for the diagnosis of reservoir hosts for \nBabesia spp., because the parasitemia in dogs naturally infected \nwith B. vogeli is usually low (FURUTA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009). Although \nthe molecular detection of B. vogeli in the present study was low \n(3.3%), the overall seroprevalence was 81.6%, suggesting a previous \nexposure to this agent. PCR is considered a highly sensitive and \nspecific technique, but its sensitivity is low when samples are \ncollected from naturally asymptomatic Babesia-infected dogs \nin the chronic phase of the disease (BOOZER; MACINTIRE, \n2003), when low fluctuations in parasitemia are observed (IRWIN, \n2009). In our study, the presence of dogs seropositive to B.\u00a0vogeli \nshowing negative results for Babesia spp. PCR suggests the \noccurrence of subclinical or chronic phase of the disease in these \nanimals. On the other hand, these same dogs could have been \nexposed to B. vogeli previously, maintaining detectable\u00a0antibody \nlevels. After sequencing, the Babesia spp. found in dogs from \nCampo Grande showed 99% of identity with B. vogeli, which \nhas already been found in dogs in the Brazilian states of Minas \nGerais (PASSOS\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005; COSTA-J\u00daNIOR\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009), \nPernambuco (RAMOS\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010), Goi\u00e1s (DUARTE\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011) \nand Mato Grosso (SPOLIDORIO\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). Serological surveys \nrevealed that the prevalence of antibodies to B. vogeli in dogs in \nBrazil ranged from 28.7% (COSTA-J\u00daNIOR\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2009) to \n46.4% (VIEIRA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013). Also, B. gibsoni has been detected \nin dogs in the state of Paran\u00e1 (TRAPP\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006).\n\nAlthough the presence of E. canis DNA has already been \ndetected in dogs in Campo Grande (DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009), \nthe present work showed a high occurrence of seropositive (65%) \nand PCR-positive animals (45%), indicating that this agent \nis widespread among dogs in this city. Thirty percent of dogs \nseropositive to E. canis were negative in the PCR assay, suggesting \nthat these animals could be in the subclinical or chronic phase \nof the disease or that they were previously exposed to E. canis. \nEhrlichia canis is a widespread tick-borne agent of dogs in Brazil \nand has been molecularly detected in several states, e.g., S\u00e3o \nPaulo (NAKAGHI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008; DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009), Rio \nde Janeiro (MACIEIRA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005), Paran\u00e1 (DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n\n2003), Bahia (CARVALHO\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008), Mato Grosso do Sul \n(DAGNONE\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2009) and Para\u00edba (TANIKAWA\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n2013). Antibodies to E. canis have also been detected in almost all \nBrazilian states, with the prevalence of exposure in dogs ranging \nfrom 4.8% (SAITO\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2008) to 73% (NAKAGHI\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n2008). Although E. canis DNA has been detected in humans \nin Venezuela (PEREZ\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2006; UNVER\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2001), the \nimportance of the parasite as a zoonotic agent remains unknown.\n\nAnaplasma platys has been molecularly detected in dogs in the \nstates of from Mato Grosso do Sul (DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009), S\u00e3o \nPaulo (DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009), Pernambuco (RAMOS\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2010) and Paran\u00e1 (SILVA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012). The percentage of A. platys \npositive samples by PCR assay in our study (1.6%) was lower than \nthat found by Dagnone\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2009) (45%) in dogs of Campo \nGrande, MS, probably because all the dogs sampled in the earlier \nstudy showed clinical signs of tick-borne diseases and the presence \nof intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in leucocytes and platelets. \nPCR has shown higher sensitivity in dogs sampled in the acute \nphase of the disease caused by A. platys (DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009).\n\nThe occurrence of co-positivity in PCR for B. vogeli and \nE.\u00a0canis in one dog, and the evidence of exposure to both agents \n(seropositivity for E. canis and B. vogeli in 56.6% of the sampled \ndogs) suggest the transmission of both agents by the same tick \nvector. Cases of co-infection by B. vogeli, E. canis and A. platys \nare frequently found due to the common tick vector of Brazilian \ndogs, R. sanguineus (DAGNONE\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003; NAKAGHI\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2008; OLIVEIRA\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2008), which can transmit all three \nagents (DANTAS-TORRES, 2008). Moreover, the environmental \nconditions may have contributed to the animals\u2019 exposure to the \nagents, since they lived in the same location (CZC). Studies are \nmuch needed on the interaction of tick-borne agents and Leishmania \nparasites in the establishment and course of the disease.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper described a study of the molecular \ndetection of E. canis, A. platys and B. vogeli in L. infantum-\nseropositive dogs from Campo Grande, MS. These pathogens should \nbe included in the differential diagnosis of dogs with compatible \nclinical signs and hematological abnormalities suggestive of tick-\nborne diseases in Campo Grande, MS.\n\nReferences\n\nAguiar DM, Saito TB, Hagiwara MK, Machado RZ, Labruna MB. \nSerological diagnosis of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis with Brazilian \nantigen of Ehrlichia canis.
