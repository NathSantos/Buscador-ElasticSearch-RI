FORMOSO*\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA Permian bentonite deposit at Melo, Uruguay is composed of a calcite-cemented sandstone containing clay\n\npseudomorphs of glass shards (0\u20130.50 m) overlying a pink massive clay deposit (0.50\u20132.10m). The massive\n\nbed is composed of two layers containing quartz and smectite or pure smectite respectively. The smectite is\n\nremarkably homogeneous throughout the profile: it is a complex mixed layer composed of three layer types\n\nwhose expandability with ethylene glycol (2EG 1EG or 0EG sheets in the interlayer zone which correspond\n\nto low-, medium- and high-charge layers respectively) varies with the cation saturating the interlayer zone.\n\nThe smectite homogeneity through the profile is the signature of an early alteration process in a lagoonal\n\nwater which was over saturated with respect to calcite. Compaction during burial has made the bentonite\n\nbed a K-depleted closed system in which diagenetic illitization was inhibited. Variations in major, REE and\n\nminor element abundances throughout the massive clay deposit suggest that it originated from two successive\n\nash falls. The incompatible element abundances are consistent with that of a volcanic glass fractionated from\n\na rhyolite magma formed in a subduction/collision geological context.\n\nKey words: bentonite, REE, incompatible elements, mixed-layer minerals, Uruguay.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBentonite beds are generally formed by alteration\nof volcanic ash in sea, brackish or fresh waters (Grim\nand G\u00fcven 1978). They represent useful chrono-\nstratigraphic units that can be traced for very long\ndistances.

A fossil reptile (Pareiasaurus ameri-\ncanus) discovered at Acegu\u00e1 indicates that the ben-\ntonite bed can be correlated to the Daptocephalus\nbiozone of the Karoo basin (Barberena et al. 1985)\nwhich belongs to the Upper Permian (Tatarian) ac-\ncording to D.C. Ara\u00fajo, unpublished data.\n\nThe Melo bentonite bed crops out in a small\nquarry 50 m on the South side of the Melo to Mon-\ntevideo road (Uruguay) 1 km from the R7 and R6\nroad intersection and 20 km from the Melo city\n(Fig. 1a). This bentonite bed and the Acegua one\nbelong to the Late Permian Yaguary Formation\n(Tatarian) of the Bacia do Paran\u00e1 (Andreis et al.\n1996). The rocks are mostly sandstones of fluvi-\natile and eolian origin alternating with mudstone\ndeposits (red beds) which are typical lagoonal de-\nposits formed during the Late Permian regression.\nConcomitantly, the volcanic activity in the north-\nern part of Patagonia increased, peaking during the\nTriassic and Early Jurassic (Andreis et al. 1996).\nThe magmas were silica-rich, and the eruptions were\nhighly explosive and gave rise to large ash deposits\n(Axelrod 1981). The bentonite bed itself is a pink,\nmassive, soft rock 1.6 m thick (Fig. 1b). It is over-\nlain by a calcite-cemented sandstone 50 cm thick.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2006/7/24 \u2014 18:16 \u2014 page 527 \u2014 #3\n\nCHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF TWO BENTONITE DEPOSITS 527\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nXRD ANALYSES\n\nThe bentonite samples were gently ground after\ndrying at 60?C and the powders were ultrasonical-\nly dispersed in distilled water. The &lt;0.1 m? frac-\ntion was separated using centrifugation and Ca-,\nNa- and K-saturated with 1N CaCl2, NaCl or KCl,\nrespectively. The excess of chloride was rinsed\nusing ethyl alcohol until no white precipitate was\nformed with AgNO3. An aliquot of the K-saturated\nsamples was Ca-exchanged using the same proce-\ndure (K-Ca samples). Oriented and random powder\nmounts were prepared for each sample. XRD pat-\nterns were recorded using a Siemens D500 diffrac-\ntometer (Cu K? radiation generated at 40 kV and\n40 mA), equipped with a stepping motor drive on\nthe goniometer (SOCABIM DACO system) and a\nKevex PSI detector (resolution: 260 eV). The an-\nalytical conditions regarding angular range, scan-\nning step size and counting time were 2\u201335 and\n2\u201375 ?2? , 0.025 and 0.040 ?2? , 4 s for oriented pre-\nparations and random powders, respectively. De-\ntailed XRD patterns were obtained from random\npowders in the 32\u201342 (4s) and 58\u201364 ?2? (8s) an-\ngular ranges for detailed study of hkl bands charac-\nteristic of 3D structures.\n\nCalculations of XRD patterns were performed\nusing the MLM3C software developed by Plan\u00e7on\nand Drits (2000). Atomic coordinates for the dif-\nferent layer types were set as recommended by\nMoore and Reynolds (1989), and the structural for-\nmula determined from chemical analyses was used\nto define the layer composition. The d00l of the dif-\nferent layer types was adjusted as needed within\nthe limits given by Sato et al. (1992) to improve\nthe quality of the fit (Table I).\n\nAmong the other parameters that had to be\nadjusted in the trial-and-error fitting procedure, spe-\ncial attention was paid to the proportions of each\nlayer type, and to the coherent scattering domain\nsize (N). The Reichweite parameter (Jagodzinski\n1949) for these three-component MLM was limited\nto R= 0 (random interstratification). Because on1y\n\nthe main features of the experimental XRD patterns\nwere reproduced, the estimated precision on the\nproportion of the different layer types is about\n\u00b110%. An additional parameter describes the seg-\nregation degree of the third component (Pcc).\n\nCHEMICAL ANALYSES\n\nMajor and minor elements including Rare Earth\nElements (REE) were analyzed from bulk rock\nsamples by ICP-Emission spectroscopy. Trace el-\nements were analyzed by ICP-MS (Service d\u2019ana-\nlyses du CNRS, Nancy). The cation exchange ca-\npacity (CEC) of the &lt;1?m fraction was obtained\nfrom Mg2+-exchanged Ca-saturated samples, the\nexcess of Mg salt being carefully washed out with\nethanol. Mg2+ was then exchanged by NH+4 and\nanalyzed in the exchange solution by atomic absorp-\ntion spectrophotometry.\n\nTOTAL SURFACE AREA (TSA)\n\nTSA measurements (external + internal surfaces)\nwere performed on the run products (&lt;1?m frac-\ntion) using the adsorption of ethylene glycol mono-\nethyl ether (EGME) according to the method re-\ncommended by Heilman et al. (1965). The total\nsurface area (TSA) is calculated from the measu-\nred EGME mass divided by the monolayer EGME\nmass adsorbed per surface unit (3.77 10?4 g m?2).\n\nRESULTS\n\nPETROGRAPHY\n\nThe studied profile is composed of two parts: From\nthe top down they are:\n\n1) 0 to 0.50 m deep: From 0 to 20 cm, the upper\nsandstone is composed of angular quartz and\nfeldspar grains, disseminated in a clay matrix\nand cemented by calcite. It exhibits glass shard\npseudomorphs in its lower part from a depth\nof 20 cm to the sandstone-bentonite interface.\nCalcite cement is more abundant in the lower\nthan in the upper part. Feldspar, mostly pla-\ngioclase, was observed only in the upper sand-\nstone.

The volcanogenic\ndebris, as well as the detrital grains, seem to\nhave been deposited simultaneously with the\nprecipitation of calcite.\n\n2) 0.50 to 2.10 m deep: the bentonite bed is a mas-\nsive pink clay with layer a density of 1.92 \u00b1\n0.05 g cm?3. Clay pseudomorphs are absent;\nthe microstructure is typical of clay-rich sedi-\nments. Calcite and dolomite crystals are pre-\nsent in all the bentonite samples as trace com-\nponents (&lt;1% in weight). The examination\nof thin sections of the massive clay bed did\nnot show the presence of any magmatic phe-\nnocrysts (zircon, sanidine, micas). The coarser\ngrains size (5 to 10?m) contains only quartz.\n\nXRD ANALYSES\n\nPowder XRD patterns from the massive\n\nbentonite bed\n\nXRD patterns from bulk rock powders show that\nthe bentonite bed is mostly composed of a well-\ncrystallized smectite. Quartz is present in the upper\npart from a depth of 0.50 to 1.30 m. Other silica-\ntes (feldspar, mica or zeolites) or carbonates com-\nmonly observed in bentonite beds are not present\nhere. The 0.60 diffraction peak at 1.498 \u00c5 shows\n\nthat the smectite is dioctahedral. Its intensity sug-\ngests a large size of the coherent scattering domains\nin the b direction (Moore and Reynolds 1989), and\nis remarkably homogeneous throughout the profile.\nThe Ca-saturated samples exhibit a large asymme-\ntrical band at 2.58 \u00c5 typical of completely turbo-\nstratic 3D structures (Reynolds 1992).\n\nXRD patterns of oriented samples\n\n(&lt;1?m fraction)\n\nCa-saturated samples. As the studied samples are\napparently all composed of \u201cpure smectite\u201d, only\nsample 8 (1.55m depth) will be detailed for sim-\nplicity. The intensity and sharpness of the 001 peak\nin the AD and EG XRD experimental patterns is\ntypical of a \u201cwell-crystallized\u201d smectite (Fig. 2a-b).\nHowever, calculated patterns (Plan\u00e7on and Drits\n2000) give a coherent solution for the AD and EG\nXRD patterns for a random MLM of 2W or 2EG\n(96%) and 1W or 1EG (4%) expanded layers (Ta-\nble II).\n\nK-saturated samples. The expandability is strong-\nly reduced: the 001 peak shifts to 11.94 \u00c5 and\n14.06 \u00c5 in the AD and EG states, respectively (Fig.\n2c-d). Calculated patterns do not give a coherent\nsolution for the two states. Indeed, the best approx-\nimations for AD and EG are a single three compo-\nnent random MLM, and a mixture of two three\ncomponent random MLM respectively (Fig. 2c-d).\n\nK-Ca saturated samples.

This indicates that some layers have\nirreversibly fixed the K+ cations. The calculated\npatterns do not give exactly the same solution for\nthe AD and EG states but the best solution for\nboth of them is a three component random and two\ncomponent random MLM (Fig. 2e-f).\n\nAll samples present the same XRD pattern dif-\nferences between the Ca-, K- and K-Ca-saturated\npreparations suggesting that the crystal structure of\nthe smectite is remarkably constant all over the ben-\ntonite bed. It is characterized by strong layer charge\nheterogeneities.\n\nThree types of layers have been considered in\nthe mixed layering depending on their respective\nlayer charges (Sato et al. 1992):\n\n\u2013 high-charge layers: collapsed to 10 \u00c5 after K-\nsaturation (0 water or ethylene glycol layer:\nSm0W, Sm0EG),\n\n\u2013 medium-charge layers:1 EG or EG in the K-\nsaturated state re-expanding to 2EG in the K-\nCa sample,\n\n\u2013 low-charge layers: 2EG even in the K-saturated\nsamples.\n\nExcept for the Ca-saturated samples, the calculated\nXRD patterns do not give similar solutions for the\nAD and EG states (Table II). Such a discrepancy\nmay be due to the fact that water and ethylene glycol\nmolecules do not have the same dipolar moment.\nThus, the number of water or ethylene glycol layers\ndepends on the Ca and K ion distribution within the\ninterlayer zones.\n\nCHEMICAL ANALYSES OF THE MASSIVE\n\nBENTONITE BED\n\nBulk rock composition (Table III)\n\nBased on bulk rock chemical compositions, the\nmassive bentonite bed appears to be divided in two\nzones. The upper zone (0,5\u20131,55 m) is SiO2-rich\nwhile the lower one (1,55\u20132,10 m) is Al2O3, Fe2O3,\nCaO, MgO \u2013 rich (Figs. 3a, b, c).

Thus, it is more appro-\npriate to compare ratios than absolute amounts of\nmajor elements excluding SiO2. The MgO/CaO and\nAl2O3/MgO ratios are roughly constant within the\ntwo zones but change abruptly at \u20131.55 m (Figs.\n3d, e). The MgO/MgO + Fe2O3 ratio decreases\nfrom bottom to top forming two successive para-\nbolic trends joining at \u20131.55 m (Fig. 3f). To the\nchemical changes observed at \u20131.55 m corresponds\nalso changes in physical properties of the clay min-\nerals. Indeed, the average TSA value (Ca-saturated\nsamples) is lower in the upper part: 597.90 instead\nof 596.64 m2 g?1. Such a convergence between\nchemical and physical properties strongly suggests\nthat the bentonite bed is composed of two layers,\neach of them being homogeneous in itself (constant\nchemical composition and TSA values).\n\nTrace elements and REE abundances\n\nTrace and REE element concentrations (Table IV)\nvary with depth. For simplicity, elements exhibiting\nthe same concentration profiles have been grouped.\nFour groups were distinguished: 1) identical con-\ncentrations amounts in the two layers (Co, Ga, Hf,\nNb, Rb, Sn, Sr, Ta, Th, Zr). This group is rep-\nresented by the Sr concentration profile (Fig. 4a);\n\n2) higher concentrations in the bottom layer (Cs,\nCu, Ge, In, Pb, U, Zn). This group is represented\nby the Cs concentration profile (Fig. 4b); 3) higher\nconcentrations in the upper layer (Ba, Be). This\ngroup is represented by the Ba concentration pro-\nfile (Fig. 4c); 4) identical patterns with a larger\nrange of variation in the bottom layer (Ce, Dy, Er,\nEu, Gd, Ho, La, Lu, Nd, Pr, Sb, Sm, Tb, Tm, Y,\nYb). This group is represented by the Dy concen-\ntration profile (Fig. 4d). The total REE concentra-\ntions in the studied samples vary from 130 to 570\nppm. However, in spite of these large differences,\nthe REE pattern abundances, normalized to chon-\ndrite, are constant in shape throughout the profile\n(Fig. 4e). They all show the negative Eu anomaly.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE VOLCANIC GLASS\n\nAs bentonites result from an alteration process, the\nchemical composition of the initial volcanic ash is\nmodified through gains and losses of elements with\nrespect to the altering solutions. Christidis (1998)\nshowed that these chemical exchanges depend on\nthe composition of the volcanic debris and the wa-\nter/rock ratio in a marine system. Consequently, it\nis excluded to use the proportions of the major ele-\nments to determine the original glass composition.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2006/7/24 \u2014 18:16 \u2014 page 531 \u2014 #7\n\nCHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF TWO BENTONITE DEPOSITS 531\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n0.5 0.6 0.7\n\nMgO/MgO + Fe 2O3Al2O 3/MgO\n\nSiO2 %\n\nde\npt\n\nh \n(c\n\nm\n)\n\nAl2O3 % oxide  %\n\nFe2O3 CaO MgO\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Evolution of the major chemical components throughout the profile. a) Variation of absolute values\n\nvs depth (m). b) Variation of MgO/CaO, Al2O3/MgO and MgO/MgO + Fe2O3 ratios vs depth (m).\n\nChristidis (1998) showed that only the ratios of the\nrelatively immobile elements in the bulk bentonite\nrock (smectite + accessory minerals) are potential\nindicators. Such attempts at chemical fingerprint-\ning have had mixed success because alteration pro-\ncesses have been shown to variably modify the rel-\native proportions of most elements. However, using\nratios of the so-called \u201cimmobile\u201d elements such\nas Ti, Zr, Y and Nb in the projection of Winch-\nester and Floyd (1977), the studied samples are in\nthe rhyolite composition field or near its boundary\n\nwith comendite/pantellerite one (Fig. 4f). The Eu\nanomaly is commonly attributed to the removal of\nEu by plagioclase feldspar during fractionation of\nthe melt. This anomaly is typical of evolved mag-\nmas.\n\nConsidering the Permian age of the bentonite\ndeposit, the source of the volcanic glass could be\nrelated to a volcanic activity triggered by the col-\nlision of the northern active margin of the Patag-\nonian micro-plate with the South American conti-\nnental plate (Ramos 1984).\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2006/7/24 \u2014 18:16 \u2014 page 532 \u2014 #8\n\n532 LIANE M.

Evaporation con-\ncentrated seawater in the lagoon until the conditions\nfor calcite precipitation were attained. The forma-\ntion of montmorillonite instead of zeolite suggests\nthat the water was not highly saline or alkaline as\nhappens in playas. The formation of montmoril-\nlonite from rhyolitic or dacitic glass produces opal\nCT (Altaner and Grim 1990). In the present case,\nthe absence of opal CT or secondary quartz indi-\ncates that oversaturation with respect to amorphous\nsilica was not attained. The lack of zeolite and opal\nCT suggests that the solutions were continuously\ndiluted by fresh water from rivers forming the del-\n\ntaic environment. The presence of small amounts of\ncalcite and dolomite crystals in the bentonite sam-\nples indicates that calcium concentration was lower\nthan alkalinity (Hardie and Eugster 1970). These\nconditions favor the formation of Mg smectites.\n\nCompared to the chemical compositions of\nmontmorillonite formed from rhyolite ash altered\nin a lacustrine environment (Zielinski 1982), the\nMelo bentonite presents a number of similarities: 1)\ndepletion in Rb, Na, K and U; 2) conservation of Th,\nTa and Hf; 3) enrichment in Ca, Mg, Sr. These facts\npoint to the influence of fresh water input in the\nlagoon.

There-\nfore, whatever the chemical variations in the profile\nwere, the formation of montmorillonite happened\nin identical conditions throughout the bentonite de-\nposit. This process is different from the progres-\nsive diagenetic transformation of volcanic glass to\nsmectite in deep-sea environments (Hein and Scholl\n1978). In the latter case, polyphased assemblages\nare produced while some glass relics survive. Fur-\nther, the smectitic minerals produced contain only\na few illite layers.\n\nThe absence of any K-bearing mineral phase\nin the Melo bentonite implies that excess Si4+ and\nK+ ions were leached out of the system. During\nburial, as compaction increases the density of the\nsediment and decreases its permeability, the ben-\ntonite bed became progressively more compact and\nformed a closed K-depleted chemical system in\nwhich the smectite-to-illite diagenetic reaction was\ninhibited. This explains why there are no illite-\nsmectite mixed layers as commonly observed in K-\nbentonites (Huff and T\u00fcrkmenogl\u00fc 1981, Altaner\net al. 1984). Nevertheless, even though illite is\nnot formed, charge heterogeneities still appear, as\nshown by the effects of K- and K-Ca-saturations on\nXRD patterns. The Melo smectite is an interstra-\ntification of expandable layers that have different\nlayer charge.\n\nIn summary, the volcanic glass was probably\naltered shortly after deposition in lagoonal water\nthat was oversaturated with respect to calcite. These\nparticular conditions were stable during the ash\nfall, which explains the mineralogical homogeneity\nthroughout the profile. Afterwards, diagenetic con-\nditions did not modify the composition of the smec-\ntite significantly because the compacting bentonite\nbed became progressively a Ca-rich K-depleted\nclosed system that was improper to illitization. The\ncompaction process destroyed the volcanoclastic\nstructures, except in the upper sandstone where\nthese structures were preserved by the rigidity of\nthe calcite cement.\n\nGRADING IN A SINGLE ASH FALL OR\n\nIN TWO ASH FALLS?\n\nThe abrupt variation of major component concen-\ntrations at the depth 1.55 m (Fig. 3) suggests that\nthe bentonite bed is composed of two parts. This\nis confirmed by variations in trace element abun-\ndances elements with greater or lower abundance in\nthe upper layer, i.e., Cs, Cu, Ge, In, Pb, U, and Zn,\n(group 2, represented by the Cs concentration pro-\nfile type, Fig. 4b) or Ba and Be (group 3, represented\nby the Be concentration profile type, Fig. 4c) and\nDy concentration profile type for group 4 (Fig. 4d)\nrespectively. Compared to sample 8 (1.55 m depth)\nwhich has the lowest REE abundance, most of the\nupper ones appear to be more HREE depleted than\nthe lower ones (Fig. 4e). The La/Yb ratio varies\nfrom 3,04 to 7,80. This means that the HREE were\npartially leached (Christidis 1998). The four groups\nof elements are shown in Figures 5a to 5d.\n\nThere variations in the amounts of major and\ntrace elements are significant. They suggest that\neither the chemical composition of the magmatic\nproducts has varied during a rhythmic volcanic\neruption, or that two successive eruptions produced\nthe ash falls. In either scenario, the two ash de-\nposits were superimposed before the transforma-\ntion of glass into smectite. The lack of any detrital\ndeposit between the two parts militates for a single\nrhythmic event. Unfortunately, as magmatic phe-\nnocrysts and particularly heavy minerals have not\nbeen found in the massive bentonite bed, it is almost\nimpossible to discriminate between the two alter-\nnatives.\n\nA POSSIBLE RHYOLITIC COMPOSITION\n\nEven if most of the major element abundances are\nmodified during the transformation of volcanic glass\nto smectite, the less mobile ones (Fe3+, Al) sug-\ngest that the initial ash composition was closer to\nrhyolite than to rhyodacite or andesite. This is con-\nfirmed by the so-called \u201cimmobile\u201d elements such\nas Ti, Zr, Y and Nb. Using ratios rather than ab-\nsolute values, the projection from Winchester and\nFloyd (1977) can be applied to altered volcanic ma-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2006/7/24 \u2014 18:16 \u2014 page 536 \u2014 #12\n\n536 LIANE M.

In the\npresent case, most of the studied samples are in the\nrhyolite composition field or near its boundary with\ncomendite/pantellerite (Fig. 4f). The Eu anomaly is\ncommonly attributed to the removal of Eu by pla-\ngioclase feldspar during fractionation of the melt.\nThis anomaly is typical of evolved magmas.\n\nTherefore, the Melo bentonite probably deri-\nved from ash resulting from an explosive frag-\nmentation of the residual melt, after plagioclase\nfeldspar crystallized from a rhyolitic magma. This\nis confirmed by spider diagrams (Figs. 5a to 5d)\nnormalized to a subduction/collision rhyolite glass\n(Juteau and Maury 1997). Considering that the neg-\n\native Rb, K and Eu anomalies are related to mag-\nmatic differentiation and plagioclase crystallization\nrespectively, it appears that the bentonite patterns\nare close to the reference line.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBased on its chemical characteristics, the thick\nMelo bentonite bed resulted probably from the su-\nperposition of two different volcanic ash deposits.\nUsing the distribution of incompatible elements,\nthe composition of the original glass appears to be\nsimilar to that of glass resulting from the fractiona-\ntion of a rhyolitic magma in a subduction/collision\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2006/7/24 \u2014 18:16 \u2014 page 537 \u2014 #13\n\nCHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF TWO BENTONITE DEPOSITS 537\n\nde\npt\n\nh \n(m\n\n)\n\nde\npt\n\nh \n(m\n\n)\n\nFig. 5b \u2013 GROUP 2\n\nsetting.
