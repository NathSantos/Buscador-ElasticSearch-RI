Most simulations must apply fast computing to emulate equipment use or, broadly speaking, a complete process. The developed or applied simulation software is able to integrate not only the projected system (piece of equipment or process) but also the non-project scenario such as out-of-specification application and troubleshooting. Engineering simulation projects in the Oil and Gas industry from upstream to downstream have been developed by ESSS, a Brazilian spin-off company dedicated to research problems and deploy solutions, bringing to its customers the best-in-class of engineering associated with a reduction of time, money and resources utilized. Sub-areas of the Oil and Gas business have their own technical approach and investment, thus very specific analysis that allows the use of simulation software: well and drilling engineering, multiphase flow in porous media, hydraulic fracturing, acid stimulation, water injection, welding, downstream and upstream equipment for combined gas-liquid-solid separation and equipment with fluid structure interaction. After twenty years of project development, ESSS has accomplished a reasonable task in providing more knowledge to this industry.\nKeywords: \u25a0 petroleum engineering \u25a0 software \u25a0 simulations \u25a0 CAE \u25a0 CFD \u25a0 FEA \u25a0 EDA\nResumo\nA simula\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma t\u00e9cnica chave da Engenharia de Petr\u00f3leo, pois consegue reduzir tempo, verbas e recursos empregados.

ESSS has the answer in one of its most recent projects.\nSubsea umbilicals are structures that transmit electricity from offshore platforms, onshore facilities and equipment. They are composed of a number of hydraulic cables which include electrical or optical fiber cables applied for controlling a subsea structure or floating offshore platform (figs. 1 and 2).\nFigure 1 - 3D schematic view of a simulated umbilical.\nFigura 1 - Representa\u00e7\u00e3o esquem\u00e1ti-ca 3D de umbilical simulada.\nFigura 1 - Representaci\u00f3n esquem\u00e1ti-ca 3D de umbilical simulada.\nFigure 2 - Cut views of a simulated umbilical, (left) mesh refinement colored by thermal energy and (right) disposition of a range of cables that form the umbilical.\nFigura 2 - Cortes transversais de umbilical simulada, (esquerda) realce de malha em cores atrav\u00e9s de energia t\u00e9rmica e (direita) disposi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma gama de cabos que constituem a umbilical.\nFigura 2 - Cortes transversales de umbilical simulada, (izquierda) realce de malla en color a trav\u00e9s de energ\u00eda t\u00e9rmica y (derecha) disposici\u00f3n de una gama de cables que constituyen el umbilical.\nOil and gas exploration and production have already experienced CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) simulation since its early stages, such as for gun perforation (*) of wells in reservoirs.\nWell engineering\nAiming to analyze most well productivity factors (gun perforation density, phase angles and diameter), several simulations were carried out for a matrix of different reservoirs and well types. CFD simulation has contributed with results of flow lines and pressure fields around wells, which cannot be evaluated by traditional reservoir simulators. Based on these analyses applying refined meshing, the well productivity calculation becomes sharply precise. In addition, the skin factor (*) can be determined and unified to the parameter back in the reservoir simulation.\nSkin factor computes the effect of flow restrictions from the formation causing a permeability loss.\nDuring the hydrocarbon well perforation and completion, it is common to find natural fractures of different sizes capable of draining the perforation fluid and affect the controlled production operation. ESSS has developed with Petrobras a computational analysis of particle (proppant) deposition within a natural fracture around a hydrocarbon well (fig. 3).\nFigure 3 - Perspective of all types of simulations applied in well development.\nFigura 3 - Visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o de todo tipo de simula\u00e7\u00e3o aplicada ao desenvolvimento de po\u00e7os.\nFigura 3 - Visualiza-ci\u00f3n de todo tipo de simulaci\u00f3n aplicada al desarrollo de pozos.\nGun perforation deals with the application of explosion loads to communicate cemented wells with the formation\nThe project aimed at developing a numerical simulation model to study particle deposition in an existing crack in a pit oil producer, with the aim of evaluating trends in the settlement of particles of different sizes and shapes. The physics involved in the problem is complex, and the modeling becomes extremely difficult, since the boundary conditions are not known and must be estimated to obtain numerical results. Thus, the work serves mainly as a development methodology to analyze the potential of numerical simulation tools to reproduce problems in the settlement of particles. The geometry used in the project is composed of a cylindrical shaft and a slot of rectangular cross section. The modeling of the settlement of the particles was evaluated using different methodologies. The problem of fluid flow was solved using computational fluid dynamics and the calculation of individual particle trajectories, including interactions between them, with the application of Newton's laws of motion, using the method of discrete elements (Moraes et al., 2011). The gravitational effect, as expected, proved to be important in the dynamics of particle deposition. As the particulate flow reaches the bottom of the slot, the particle is substantially stagnant, before promoting the packaging and consequently closing the slit. The methodology showed results consistent with the physical packaging involving particles in a confined geometry, providing the basis for testing various properties of the particles and operating conditions, thus targeting the largest packaging slit. The mathematical model, currently under development, has shown great potential to assist in implementing these critical operational processes encountered during drilling and completion of oil producing wells.\nDrilling engineering\nIt has been possible for ESSS and Petrobras to simulate the flow of a drilling fluid through the process with the bit rotating. Reverse flow on drilling aims to cool down and lubricate the bit as well as carry rock particles through the flow. In conventional drills, drilling fluid is injected into the internal region of the drill bit and back to the outer annular. However, by the proposed conceptual Petrobras drilling, fluid is injected into the annular region through the axle itself. The purpose of the simulation project has been to study the flow in this configuration, using CFD analysis\nperformed on a PDC drill bit type. The PDC drill bit has been modelled with the mechanism of shear characteristic, turbulent flow and a non-Newtonian fluid in rotating equipment. Results of the multiphase simulations allowed an assessment of the distribution of solid particles along the field, and thus verification of the possible accumulation regions by identification of particle paths in the computational domain (fig. 4).\nFigure 4 - Results of fluid path (lines) and velocity intensity colored in a drilling simulation.\nFigura 4 - Resultados do caminho do fluido (linhas) e intensidade da velocidade (em cores) em simula\u00e7\u00e3o de perfura\u00e7\u00e3o.\nFigura 4 - Resultados de la ruta del fluido (l\u00edneas) e intensidad de la velocidad (en color) en la simulation de perforation.\nMultiphase flow in porous media\nA study on the modeling of multiphase flow in porous media was undertaken to simulate the coupling between the well and the reservoir. To perform the simulations, several experimental data are needed from the reservoir to be analyzed. The numerical simulation of oil reservoirs aims at optimizing production by positioning several producers and injectors, including horizontal wells. This is a result of recent advances and innovations in drilling techniques that have allowed the use of horizontal wells, and found a new and wide range of fields in oil exploration. These applications have shown significant economic advantages, and consequently opened up the possibility of exploiting thin reservoirs, natural fracturing formations with low permeability, high anisotropy and in some cases, sand production wells (Sansoni Junior et al, 2007).\nESSS has also developed a module with Petrobras for the solution of two-phase Darcy's law coupled with a commercial CFD software (ANSYS FLUENT). Alternative equations for multiphase flow in porous media have been developed and a new solver has been implemented within the software. Those based on Darcy's law equations are well known in the area of reservoir simulation. The transport equations of saturation and pressure are not standards in ANSYS FLUENT program and must therefore be programmed via UDF (User Defined Functions). There are some alternative formulations for the differential equations of two-phase flow in porous media. The formulation where the pressure and the saturation are the main variables was chosen to solve the problem. It is considered for this step that the capillary pressure effects are negligible, gravitational effects are negligible, the fluids can be treated as incompressible and that the local porosity of subsurface environment is constant (although variable in space). In the left equation, the mobility of the water and oil are varying with time and space, since these variables depend on water saturation. The equation on the right corresponds to the saturation transport (water or oil). The procedure for calculating the solution of the two scalar equations using ANSYS FLUENT software considered validated model data from literature for saturation and pressure fields. It is important to mention that the methodology used was to verify the convergence in time step by varying the Courant number until the solution does not vary significantly any more. This can be observed for bends Courant between 0.25 and 0.1, characterizing thereby that the converged numerical solution for the time-step problem was achieved by scanning different fields for different saturation Courant. The behavior of the water and the oil in the porous medium is dependent on the choice of relative permeability curves. The robustness of the code was tested for a case of greater non-linearity of a relative permeability curve model (fig. 5).\nTo better check the variation of pressure values in a well, a project considered the numerical simulation of transient pressure data comparing theory and Darcy mixture model. By definition, well tests measure the transient pressure while the well flow is kept constant. So, when it comes to well testing, a study of the transient behavior of the pressure in the reservoir needs to be made. The transient response of the pressure together with the constant flow into the well also depends on both properties in the reservoir. These properties\nPressure (kgf/cmz)\nFigure 5 - Results of fluid pressure in a reservoir simulation.\nFigura 5 - Resultados da press\u00e3o do fluido em simula\u00e7\u00e3o de reservat\u00f3rio.\nFigura 5 - Resultados de la presi\u00f3n del fluido en simulaci\u00f3n de dep\u00f3sito.\nmay be the permeability of the rock, the high heterogeneity of the reservoirs as well as the damaged well (skin factor). In well tests, it is measured by the evolution of the pressure in the well due to the variation of flow imposed at the well itself. The measured flow during production serves as an indication of the productivity of the reservoir, and pressure measurements can be used to calculate the properties of the reservoir. The following practical results can be obtained in a test of the well; the static pressure of the reservoir, effective permeability of the produced fluid, transmissivity of the reservoir, the approximate drainage area of the shell and the possibility of commercial exploitation. An example of a well test is simulated and validated. This paper compares two different theoretical formulations used in reservoir simulation: Darcy's Law, which can be used in conjunction with the law of conservation of mass to obtain an expression for the hydraulic diffusivity of fluid flow in porous media, and the mixing theory, which allows a local description of the flow in a porous medium supported by a thermodynamically consistent theory that generalizes the continuous classical mechanics. The problem for research is, given the two different formulations, to determine the behavior of the pressure along the porous medium and compare the results. The compressibility of oil and formation are accounted for. The flow is one-dimensional and the test case for validation is illustrated in the Model for comparison of different approaches. One of the cases studied, shows the pressure at x = 0 and sealed porous medium at x = L. Due to the pressure exerted on the limit being much lower than the initial pressure, the fluid\nbegins to move. For the case of liquids in porous media, the results are very close. This shows that using a more simplified theory, such as Darcy's law, leads to the same results as the mixing theory. The computationally less expensive model can then be applied to real cases without loss of generality. A case of open pit and a hydraulic fracture was also simulated. The findings from the two cases can be seen below. The use of CFD enabled the accounting for changes in the pressure field in a hydraulically fractured well considering the fracture line and the actual dimensions.\nAnother project was the development of a solver for single-phase flow in porous media Black Oil. The objective is to develop a tool with the capability of solving two directions of the flow between the well and the reservoir. Aiming to use all capabilities of ANSYS FLUENT software, the equations for single-phase flow in porous media, considering the hypothesis Black Oil, were developed through UDF. Dialogs were scheduled to facilitate the use of the new solver and facilitate the entry of data for problem resolution. Various types of reservoirs can be solved with the new solver. Homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs may be chosen as well as the fluid in the porous medium having constant or variable properties in the reservoir. This type of solver can assist petroleum engineers in decisions such as: how to design the best well to produce oil or gas from reservoir rock; to analyze the influence of the well geometry and completion in well productivity; determine increased productivity of hydraulically fractured wells; describe the distribution of the flow along the horizontal well; determine what the optimal length and diameter of a horizontal well is, and if multi-fractured wells, determine the optimum number of fractures along the well. The use of CFD in these types of cases fills a gap between the well and the reservoir. The reservoir simulators have good computational tools for mathematical modeling of flow through porous media, but poor representation of the well. In vessels, the simulation results are slightly affected by the geometry or type of well completion. Already in simulated wells, a better analysis of the well is made considering the characteristics of the well, such as hydraulic fractures, open intervals, completion and geometry, but these tools are very inaccurate compared to the flow in porous media. The regions near the well were removed from IMEX software and imported into the CFD calculation. Reservoirs with simple drainage areas were used for the numerical validation and\nthe new solver was compared with the IMEX simulator. With these results, the pressure drop in the well was disregarded and considered open pit (without completion). Reservoirs with more actual drainage areas were also simulated. The geometries of reservoirs IMEX and ANSYS FLUENT are close but not identical. Therefore, the comparison of results for the flow in the well is not identical.\nHydraulic fracturing\nHydraulic fracturing is a technique widely used in the oil industry. For creating a fracture in a porous medium, a fluid must be injected into the reservoir at high pressure. This pressure must be high enough to induce a fracture in the rock, which will be opened according to the stress to which the rock has been subjected. A material (proppant) is pumped into the fracture in order to keep it open after the pressure falls. Fractures filled with proppant create a narrow channel which connects the reservoir with the shaft through a highly conductive medium. In general, the fracture propagates in both directions from the pit, reaching great heights and expressive horizontal lengths. Typically, thicknesses of a fracture in low permeability formations are to the order of 2.5mm, while its length can reach hundreds of meters. In high permeability reservoirs, such openings are much larger, reaching up to 5cm, while the lengths are limited to tens of meters. Hydraulic fractures increase production in wells due to the highly conductive connection established between the well and the reservoir. The production of fractured wells depends on several factors such as the dimensions of the fracture, the fracture conductivity, conductivity of the formation and the drainage area of the reservoir. Another important factor is the damage created during the fracturing process. The behavior of the flow in regions near the well is extremely important for a correct prediction of well productivity. A more refined mesh around the well is necessary to take into account the high pressure gradients, the behavior of the radial flow and the heterogeneity of the well. The general equation for fluid flow in porous media can be found in at least two approaches: the technique of site and the average volumetric mixing theory. Macroscopic equations obtained after the volumetric integration over a representative volume\nelement (REV) permit the use of the classical mechanics of continuity approach. The use of mixture theory gives rise to new parameters in order to consider the interaction between the thermo-mechanical components. The mixture theory allows a local description of the flow in porous media, supported by a thermodynamically consistent theory that generalizes the classical mechanical continuity approach. The geometry of the reservoir is circular and fairly simple. The production of an open pit was simulated in order to compare the productivity gain of fractured vertical wells. For calculation purposes, only a quarter of the simplified circular reservoir was considered. Two symmetry boundary conditions were imposed. Flow rates calculated by the CFD model, considering pit fractures, were compared with the flow of another model with flow and reservoir having similar properties, built in IMEX geometry. The schematic diagram for the propagation of the pressure within the fracture may be observed in the case of finite conductivity. As the geometry of the fracture is circular and its permeability is much higher than the training, you can see the propagation of pressure in the form of fracture. This paper presents a CFD study to analyze the propagation of pressure in the reservoir and fracture. It is considered a transient reservoir for all cases. The analysis presents a challenge for the numerical solution due to the different scales involved. The dimensions of the reservoir (km), the well (cm) and fracture (mm) are designed precisely. The main objective of this study was to analyze the increased production of fractured wells considering fractures of finite conductivity compared to wells without fractures (fig. 6).\nAcid stimulation\nA numerical simulation with acid stimulation in wells was performed to evaluate the flow of acid into a pit of oil production and its effects on training-based carbonate. Simulations of acidification will be held considering the formation of wormholes. The dummy variables of the reactive flow in porous media under the influence of prevailing operating conditions are pressure and flow of acid. The standard stochastic properties of the rock consist of permeability and porosity. During the drilling operation of oil wells, which are\nFigure 6 - Time evolution of fluid pressure throughout the fracture simulation in a near-well region.\nFigura 6 - Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo de press\u00e3o do fluido em toda a simula\u00e7\u00e3o de fratura em regi\u00e3o pr\u00f3xima ao po\u00e7o.\nFigura 6 - Evoluci\u00f3n del tiempo de presi\u00f3n del fluido en toda la simulaci\u00f3n de fractura en regi\u00f3n pr\u00f3xima al pozo.\nhorizontal, vertical or directional, it is the invasion of one common share of the drilling fluid in the rock formation. Although undesirable when it occurs in invasion of permeable zones (yield potential), this causes a local damage. This term refers to the alteration of the permeability in the well and this change can cause reduced production and even stop the flow of oil to the well. In this regard, drilling fluids employed in drilling need to have special features. These fluids contain a thickening agent such as calcareous or dolomitic lime, in order that any damage can be removed by an additional operation of acidification. This operation consists of pumping a predetermined volume of acid solution into the formation. The acid-base reaction promotes the dissolution of the damage, restoring the original properties of the rock. The study focused on the prediction of the patterns of formation of wormholes, seeks to optimize the sizing of the volume of acid injection, pending an efficient acidification with less time and cost of operation. Currently, CFD has been complementing experimental and theoretical work to provide\neconomically attractive alternatives, enabling breakthroughs in conditions often unavailable experimentally (fig. 7).\nFigure 7 - Wormholes formed by fluid penetration within the rock and colored by pressure results of the CFD simulation.\nFigura 7 - Fendas formadas pela penetra\u00e7\u00e3o do fluido na rocha e em cores devido aos resultados da press\u00e3o na simula\u00e7\u00e3o CFD.\nFigura 7 - Fendas formadas por la penetration del fluido en la roca y en colores debido a los resultados de la presi\u00f3n en la simulaci\u00f3n CFD.\nWater injection\nA study of modeling flow and reactions in water injection wells and oil reservoirs, with the aim of using CFD to reproduce the flow, has been undertaken. Specifically, the evaluated cases involve injection wells, i.e., wells used for inserting water into the reservoir, causing a pressure increase and enabling the production of oil. The water is injected in such processes and interacts with the acidic minerals present in the reservoir via a series of chemical reactions. These reactions can lead to the formation or solubility of minerals in the reservoir, thereby changing the porosity and permeability of the medium. Thus, the main chemical reactions occurring in the process were also included in the mathematical formulation. In the simulations, a one-axisymmetric reservoir section was presented. In this area, it was then possible to observe variations in porosity and permeability of the medium, along with variations in volume fractions of the components of rock (calcite and dolomite). The results obtained allow visualization of variations in porosity and the volume fraction of calcite, for example.\nWelding\nA fluid-structure interaction simulation has been set up to solve an important engineering problem, which is how to safely weld a pipe while operating.\nThe welding operation is a procedure performed when the equipment that is being welded is in service, and is generally used when there is a need for some kind of repair or adjustment that cannot be made during equipment downtime, or when the cost of failure is very high. Welding pipelines in operation requires heating the duct wall and must prevent ignition temperature of the product inside the duct by transferring this heat to the fluid flow. When dealing with thermal phenomena, it is fundamental to model the heat source correctly.\nIn this project, a numerical model was developed by CFD to account for the influence of the flow of the product line on the process of exchange of energy generated by the heat source for welding. The numerical results of the CFD simulation were compared with traditional welding process software and the results on this type of analysis bring great advantages, with realistic characteristics to the fluid simulation of multiphase flow, beyond the capacity of traditional software typically used to check the operation of the welding process. Also, CFD and FEA coupled can reveal residual stress on pipes (fig. 8).\nFigure 8 - Results of thermal stress colored by temperature in a piece of equipment from a fluid-structure interaction simulation.\nFigura 8 - Resultados da tens\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica em cores devido \u00e0 temperatura em equipamento, obtida na simula\u00e7\u00e3o de intera\u00e7\u00e3o em estrutura fluida.\nFigura 8 - Resultados de la tension t\u00e9rmica en color debido a la temperatura en equipo, obtenida en la simulaci\u00f3n de interacci\u00f3n en estructura fluida.\nHeat transfer has been investigated for fluid through the duct, and by welding streams through simulation considering all the properties of solids (duct, sleeve and strings) and gases (methane, in the duct, and air in the tubes gap) with local variation of temperature.\nResults allowed verification of temperature profile along the pipeline, in addition to monitoring the local temperature of the duct. Thus, it was possible to evaluate the temperature on the inner wall of the duct, which is fundamental to the operation of repair, and depending on the cooling rate, to predict the hardness after the welding process. Subsequently, the temperature profile is brought to a structural analysis such as transient thermal load condition, which may determine the residual stresses. One can analyze the temperature profile of the weld and its displacement effect on repair and pipe.\nThe development of this study allowed Petrobras greater knowledge of the temperature fields and cooling rates, thereby allowing safer operations of the repair process under specific conditions not addressed by traditional software.\nUpstream equipment for gas-liquid-solid separation\nModeling internal devices from three-phase primary oil separation (gravity settling) has been challenging the industry since natural gas, oil, water and sand have been lifted simultaneously through the flow of a production riser. Due to the difficulty of a single step separation, three main chains need to adapt their standards to transfer their volume to be treated, injected or disposed of (Moraes et al., 2011).\nThe first stage of separation is located immediately downstream of the manifold production and performs the separation of the three phases: water, oil and gas. Gravitational separator vessels are mostly used for two-phase gas-liquid separation. Several devices are present in gravitational separator vessels: cyclones, baffles, mist eliminators in agglutination section, structured fillings and control of the oil-water interface systems.\nModelling and simulation of the flow within vessels with full gravity separators have to take into account influence of the internal devices and the efficiency of phase separation must be calculated. Results indicate sizing and positioning of these devices in order to maximize the residence time of the phases in the machine, and optimize their performance (fig. 9).\nThe design flow within a cyclone, located at the entrance of the vessel section known as primary separation has been studied. Gas is separated from the liquid at the bottom of the vessel in the fluid accumulation section, where the retention time should be sufficient to separate the remaining gas phase dissolved in the liquid phase.\nResults have shown that equipment installed has a weak centrifugal effect, insufficient for effective separation. Solutions have been to allow the gas phase to bypass the vortex finder and leave the cyclone through the overflow. The liquid phase presented great inertia and ends up colliding with the walls of the device. Thus, the efficiency of the cyclone is limited and it is expected that small droplets are transported by the gas stream leaving the cyclone through its upper outlet. New configurations for this entry are being proposed and evaluated using the same methodology, in order to lead to the cyclone effect separating the phases.\nUpstream equipment for liquid-solid separation\nMultiphase flow has been simulated for a riser flowline with oil, gas, water and sand, based on the scenario where the gravel packer is \"dead\". Gravel packing operations are performed to prevent sand production, because if sand is produced, it can accumulate inside the lines and risers, causing downtime for oil. Thus, if the gravel packer is \"dead\", the produced sand must be carried in the continuous phase, avoiding downtime and PIG operations. Accordingly, the CFD approach was used to verify whether the sand would accumulate in a given riser flowline during oil production or not.\nFigure 9 - 3D view of fluid velocity simulation results within a gravitational separation vessel.\nFigura 9 - Representa\u00e7\u00e3o 3D dos resultados da simula\u00e7\u00e3o de velocidade do fluido em vaso de separa\u00e7\u00e3o por gravidade.\nFigura 9 - Representaci\u00f3n 3D de los resultados de la simulaci\u00f3n de velocidad del fluido en vaso de separaci\u00f3n por gravedad.\nThe complexity of this study stems from the fact that four phases coexist in the system (three continuous phases and a dispersed phase), and the vast extent of the simulation domain. As it is impractical to simulate the entire length of the line due to the high computational cost, it was chosen to simulate two different sections of geometry, first passing through the lowest point of the flowline and second containing the greatest vertical angle to the sea. Both geometries are approximately 300m long. Here, CFD simulations were transient, since the sand particles needed to be monitored throughout the domain. To reduce the number of equations\nin the mathematical modeling, water and oil phases were modeled as a single pseudo-phase and gas-liquid flow was modeled using the VOF model. The dispersed phase was treated by the Lagrangian approach, enabling the consideration of the size distribution of the sand particles.\nThe project allowed us to calculate and verify the location of the gas volume fraction in a region of the domain, showing the achievement of an intermittent regime. It was also observed where particles accumulate. The results obtained show that not all particles leave the domain. Particles with\nsmaller diameters are entrained, while larger particles are retained, allowing Petrobras engineers to identify possible problems of accumulation of sand and consequently estimate the frequency and the need for maintenance on the line.\nAnother study evaluated the potential removal of the liquid film around particles, using CFD to study a device where there is a mixture of substances A, B and dissolved salts. The gradient of composition in this mixture is such that at the beginning of the operation, the top of the equipment is mostly occupied by the substance, while there is no presence of this substance in the background. Salt particles from a device positioned upstream fall into this equipment, and a thin film of the substance A can be found in these particles when they reach the bottom of the equipment. The main purpose of this equipment is to promote the removal of this film around the particles. For this purpose, the device has baffles inside. The intention of this study is, through CFD simulation, to analyze different geometric configurations for the device, evaluating the effect of shear rate on the removal of the film. The geometries and the meshes of this case were generated parametrically, so that a new setting could easily be generated. Four configurations were examined: one without and three cases with baffles at 35, 45 and 60 degrees, respectively.\nTwo-dimensional simulations were transient. The continuous phase, multi-component, was considered to represent the three species, whereas the Lagrangian approach, two-way coupling, was adopted to simulate the salt particles. The post-processing software allows customization of En-sight via the Python programming language characteristics, associated with particular functions of this software. This possibility of development was used to supply a demand post-processing that was not, in principle, available at the interface of the software used. This is the monitoring of shear stress per particle, i.e. the recorded values of shear stress to which the particles are subjected while they go through their career in the field. For this, it was necessary to integrate with the software development team of ESSS.\nWith the simulations, it was noticeable that the higher shear rate, which is directly linked to mass transfer of MEG (Monoethylene Glycol) to brine, was obtained in the case of the smallest angle with baffles. Cases without baffles were\nthose which had lower shear rates. Analyses were performed for the shear stresses in the entire field of equipment and only in the area where there are particles. There was a higher rate of shear when considering only the regions with salt particles (10 to 15 % higher). From the literature review of mass transfer conducted and the results obtained in the simulation, an analysis of mass transfer has been performed which aims to analyze the volume of MEG that will be recovered in the operation of the equipment, depending on the thickness of the liquid film around the particles. Thus, the required residence time for the particles to lose the entire salt film in the existing liquid was obtained. It was noted that the lowest residence time required is given for the case with higher shear rate (lower angle baffles). However, the residence times required are still much smaller than the residence time of the particles of salt.\nIn general it was found that the baffles provide efficiency in the recovery of MEG in the process, especially due to increased shear rate experienced by the particles in the presence thereof. However, it is known that baffles could also cause clogging problems in the equipment due to accumulation of particles.\nUpstream equipment for gas-liquid separation\nA project has been developed to analyze the flow within a compact gas-liquid separator. The objective of the project has been to model the flow within a Petrobras design cyclonic separator to assess its efficiency in separating the gas and liquid phases. By obtaining a simulation methodology, further studies of geometric optimization of the device have been possible, either by reducing the number of prototypes to be tested or by evaluating them experimentally.\nCyclonic separation is based on the generation of a centrifugal field, in a cylindrical body, acting similarly to gravitational separators, but with the gravitational field of intensity hundreds (to thousands) of times larger, promoting better separation of fluids with different densities. The flow inside the cyclone is complex, gas phase exits through the\nupper outlet, named \"overflow\". The liquid phases leave the separator through the bottom outlet, named \"underflow\". The vortex breaker extends to near the end of the conical section. Shortly after the end of the conical section, a device was included to stop the gas generated from falling into the lower sections of the equipment. The thicknesses of all internal walls, according to ANSI Standards B.36.10 and B.36.19 were considered in generating the geometry.\nTo simulate the flow within the device Eulerian-Eulerian modeling approach has been applied. The gas phase was regarded as the primary, continuous phase while the dispersed liquid phases were considered, both with an average diameter of 500 microns. To model the exchange of momentum between phases a coefficient of symmetrical drag was prescribed. The simulations were transient, following up the flow along the simulation time until a steady state was reached. There was no temperature exchange with external environment. It was observed that the liquid level remains constant, specified by the Petrobras team for the configuration's chosen position. In addition, there was a negligible gas drag in the underflow output current, proving the efficacy of the device in the separation of gas and liquid phases. Due to the low residence time of the phases, the Petrobras design engineers could choose to modify the geometry accordingly to their separation objectives.\nUpstream equipment for liquid-liquid separation\nNumerical simulations of water-oil separation within hydrocyclones were conducted with the objective of generating a guide to \"best practices\". This methodology has been applied to studies of the flow in hydrocyclones and cyclones, single and multiphase, to optimize geometry and operating conditions of the equipment. Despite displaying geometries and very simple operations, hydrocyclones are challenging due to the numerical modeling of complex physical phenomena that characterize the flow, even in the simplest case (single phase). Very specific models should be used for the treatment of turbulence and the movement behavior of the phases (Moraes et al., 2008).\nTo validate the methodology studied in a model of hydrocyclone dimensions, operating conditions and measurements of speed and load loss profiles detailed in literature have been applied. For the single-phase, a case study of the influence of mesh parameters (type, disposition of fines, and total number of control volumes), applied boundary conditions, and turbulence models were used (fig. 10).\nThe results obtained were satisfactory, since the methodology developed is efficient and reliable. The tangential velocity profiles obtained in the numerical simulation were consistent, qualitatively and quantitatively, with the experimental results. Innovative final methodology obtained, which is able to allow detailed visualization of the internal phenomena in hydrocyclones, has been used in the development of new models for hydrocyclones operating with water and oil, and is being applied (and improved) in work in progress in the group. The development of new models of hydrocyclone for the separation of water and oil is the object of extreme interest to Petrobras. A further application of hydrocyclones for separation platforms, for example, can drastically reduce the size, or the number of gravitational separators for the same purpose. Such separators are usually the larger pieces of equipment installed, in contrast to batteries of hydrocyclones which generally occupy a very small space.\nUsing the methodology of numerical simulation of the flow inside hydrocyclones, previously developed by the same R&amp;D group, ESSS performed a study of geometric optimization of a model of hydrocyclone for a given operating condition. The base model was developed by Petrobras and has been patented.\nBased on this model, five other geometries were generated from variations of the hydrocyclone (operations scale-up and scale-down) geometry. These geometries were then simulated for certain operating conditions, defined by the Petrobras team involved in the project. The goal was to choose some of these geometries to be manufactured and go through an experimental study. The choice was based on the geometry of the best relationship between the tangential velocity profile and the pressure drop obtained. After comparing the results, the geometries of the prototypes for the manufacture of steel, which was used for operations in field tests with water and oil, were defined.\nFigure 10 - 3D view of velocity contours from CFD simulation of a hydrocyclone.\nFigura 10 - Representa\u00e7\u00e3o 3D dos contornos de velocidade obtida na simula\u00e7\u00e3o por computador de um hidrociclone.\nFigura 10 - Representaci\u00f3n 3D de los contornos de velocidad obtenida en la simulaci\u00f3n por computa-dora de un hidrocicl\u00f3n.\nAnother study dealt with simulation within an alternative valve to reduce emulsion in the oil primary separation. At all stages of the primary processing of oil, the degree of emulsion water in oil or vice versa is an extremely important factor, which may also limit the production of a particular platform. Some equipment installed along the primary processing chain, among which we can mention valves and underwater centrifugal pumps, end up facilitating the generation of emulsion. This is because they impose a high degree of shear on the fluid flowing through them, which hampers the water separation equipment.\nDeveloped in this project was an alternative to the valves normally used to regulate flow and pressure drop. This valve has a peculiar geometry, able to impose a much lower shear\nto the fluid passing through it. Thus, the degree of emulsion generated is smaller when compared to conventional valves, which directly implies a greater ease of separation of the oil-water stream. The CFD tool was used to evaluate the hydrodynamics inside the valve, thus allowing greater understanding of the flow inside the device and optimizing its main geometrical parameters, reducing the cost of building new prototypes and testing. Laboratory tests were conducted using some prototypes of this valve and their results were compared with those obtained with the numerical simulation. The degree of agreement between experimental data and numerical simulations was high, with axial and tangential velocities qualitatively very similar in profile (Moraes et al., 2009). The simulation was able to capture the profile expected for cyclonic pressure of the valve, with the pressure\ndecreasing as the distance to walls, and the current lines show the establishment of the circulatory flow in the bottom of the valve, allowing the establishment of a centrifugal field, promoting phase separation by the cyclone effect.\nA pre-floating tank has been simulated aiming to evaluate alternatives or geometrical modifications, which was capable of increasing water-oil separation efficiency. Performance results of three types of washing tank with different flows and concentrations of oil in water via computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD) were obtained. Such tanks differ by whether or not internal, and what type of internal mechanics (product distributor, collector of water and oil and baffles) are used. Variations in concentration and flow were made in order to measure the effects of these variables on the separation efficiency. The inner tank is more efficient than the internal free, since the recirculation of water produces a smaller dead volume. Moreover, it was possible to identify some potential problems in the water trap design.\nUpstream equipment with fluid structure interaction\nSimulation of annular flow within flexible pipes was carried out with CFD. Mechanical failures in the use of flexible risers for subsea connections between extraction and oil rigs may occur and compromise its integrity. These failures occur mostly due to rupture of the outer protective cover, which can lead to corrosion. This is due to the presence of seawater passing through a hole in any part of the outer jacket, coming into contact with the metal inner layers, which are responsible for mechanical strength, and remaining in this region due to the polymer lining of the duct being waterproof. To remedy corrosion, risers can receive injections of a fluid corrosion inhibitor in their annular region (between the two raincoats) replacing seawater that was present and minimizing this undesirable phenomenon. The injection of this fluid inhibitor as described above is suggested by engineers to reduce the corrosion process alternative. Considering the difficulty of conducting experiments able to reproduce the effects with great precision, the ESSS team conducted a detailed study of the structural behavior and its\nhydrodynamics, helping to develop an innovative technique for prevention of the problems mentioned above.\nStructural analysis of the behavior of the riser under loading pressure determined the displacement of the protective cover, and thus the region of fluid dynamics analysis was defined. Due to the high complexity of the outflow region between the plates (to the order of millimeters), and the prohibitive cost of a full hydrodynamic simulation of the entire riser (to the order of kilometers), a solution was proposed by the artifice of a condition periodicity. The fluid dynamic results and correlations were analyzed for loss and flush time. The analysis allows Petrobras engineers greater assertiveness in the analysis of the flush out process.\nDownstream equipment for liquid-solid separation\nESSS conducted studies of the separator vessel and the bottom of the fractionator coke. The delayed coking process converts heavy petroleum fractions, typically the vacuum residue arising from the distillation unit at the refinery, into light or higher value added products such as LPG, naphtha, gas oil and coke. The focus of the study is the analysis of the bottom of the fractionator, the coke separator vessel, whose goal is the removal of coke fines arising from previous steps. The coke collected in the separator vessel is then sent to the kiln for firing and eventual discharge. However, part of the system coke remains as undesirable fines. The accumulation of these coke fines in the bottom of fractionators, for example, is a real problem in refineries, due to the unplanned stoppages caused in them, among other considerations (Oliveira et al., 2011). The problem associated with such vessels, is that during their cleaning process, it was found that no, or almost no, fine coke accumulated in the interior. This cleaning process consists of feeding a heavy diesel chain (GOP) hot, followed by a cold GOP, and finally another stream of wash oil, always waiting for equality between the inlet temperature of the cleaning fluid and pot temperature. The upward flow is entering the bottom of the pot and out the spout of the pot into the bottom of the tower. The flow of these fluids release is generally low, just\nto avoid the drag of coke fines for fractionation. However, the cold GOP is more viscous and dense than extra heavy oil (GOEXP) and can therefore adduce fines back to the bottom of the tower during the step of release from the vessel. The problems associated with the appearance of fines in the bottom of the fractionator are: forming coke \"in situ\u201d at the bottom of the fractionator; entrainment of fines during the steps of filling and/or venting of the drums; poor decoking, sending fines for the heating vessel and consequently to the tower; and gain loss of the drums (fig. 11).\nFigure 11 - 3D view of volume of fraction results within a vacuum separation vessel.\nFigura 11 - Representa\u00e7\u00e3o 3D dos resultados de volume de fra\u00e7\u00e3o em vaso de separa\u00e7\u00e3o por v\u00e1cuo.\nFigura 11 - Representation 3D de los resultados de volumen de fraction en vaso de separaci\u00f3n por vac\u00edo.\nTo examine the veracity of these hypotheses, given the difficulty of measuring what really happens over time and the fractionation process in the separator vessel for coke, the CFD analysis proves a valuable tool for the study and is the subject of this report. Initially, we evaluated the degree of drag of coke fines, using the removal vessel for a completely empty condition input flow vessel, coke and density of two distributions diameter. The hypothesis that was used to evaluate the size of the particles that pass through the filters recirculating at the bottom of the towers of the Delayed Coking Units at Petrobras, with an initial diameter corresponding to the diameter of the filter of CASE 1 was\nraised: this would be too large in diameter compared with the diameter of particles found within the tower CASE 1.\nSmaller particles favor the drag causing a short-circuit between the input line and the output line of the vessel. No drag was observed using larger particles, so that the particles found in the vessel at the opening for cleaning should be larger than the particles removed from the bottom of the fractionator. This question can be remedied with an analysis of particle size distribution in both locations.\nThe study also aimed to evaluate the geometry of the vessel in the normal flow of operation and reduced flow. ESSS compared the current geometry of CASE 1 in the normal flow, the CASE 1 geometry with the edges of the trough extended in normal and reduced flow, and the geometry of CASE 2 in normal and reduced flow. The geometry of CASE 1 with extended chute was designed with the aim of facilitating the deployment, reducing the additional costs in CASE 1.\nThe geometry of CASE 2 with reduced flow recirculation had a lower coke particle size in the exit region of the vessel, which would lead to lower drag compared to other geometries. One can also observe that the worst case is the current geometry of CASE 1, considering the cases studied. The geometry of CASE 1 with extended chute was better than the current, but far from ideal that would direct settling of particles without recirculating the vessel. Interestingly, even as the largest flow in the geometric arrangement existing, CASE 2 presents itself as among the best studied. This can be seen from the flow profiles in the vessel, where CASE 2 presents a more homogeneous profile, i.e. there appears to be a lower short-circuit in relation to the coke entering the system.\nDownstream equipment for gas-liquid separation\nA study of internal hydrocarbon reflux for heavy naphtha and kerosene under a fractionating bed has been performed using CFD. The study aimed to evaluate the homogeneity in the distribution of hydrocarbons in the collecting-pan\ncirculating reflux top (pan with chimneys and \"downpipes\"). In this pan, there is the withdrawal of current flow from the top, sending down the internal reflux (heavy naphtha) to the liquid distributor, which feeds the fractionation bed with heavy naphtha and kerosene. The study was conducted considering only a geometric arrangement operating on a single condition; the condition of maximum flow. However, as the simulation strategy was considered to be a quarter of the pan geometry, this model implies simplification in reducing the computational time for this study. Schematically, it represents the five \"downpipes\" evaluated for the geometry of the collecting pan considered.\nThe simulations were performed considering a quarter of the collector section, incompressible fluid and transient with time step of 0.1s, the effect of variation in the distribution of hydrocarbons (liquid phase) and the effect of the position of the \"downcomer\" in relation to the position of \"downpipes\". Accordingly, the variation of the volume fraction of liquid was considered. As a result of this work, Petrobras has generated a patent for this innovative solution.\nAnother study was the quench system riser. The quench system is a very important area of preparation of this charge before entering the riser. The main objective is to use a vapor charge to disperse a liquid load, causing it to enter the riser with a larger contact area with the catalyst present in the riser, thus facilitating the vaporization and cracking reactions. The vapor charge is also used for high temperature, causing some energy to be previously transferred to the liquid phase. It is desirable that there is no steam condensation phenomenon, as this can impair the function of the steam that will perform the load dispersion and energy supply.\nThe goal of this work has been to define the two-phase flow regime that is established after mixing, to study the mass transfer between the phases of steam and condensation of liquid and to observe the differences when switching the position of the inputs of liquid and vapor.\nInitially a two-dimensional modeling was used throughout the study but a step -dimensional study by including a new geometry of the quench system with an angle of 30\u00b0 between the main riser and the line was included. The following are the steps: first step - 2D study of the quench\nsystem, considering both settings, fluid in the main steam line and the main line; second step- 3D study including the new geometry with an angle between the centerlines of the riser and the injection nozzle of the quench.\nThe ESSS team has noted that the flow regime obtained by CFD simulation is close to the void, which agrees with the map of flow at Perry &amp; Green, ranked from the velocities of the liquid and vapor flow regimes.\nA benchmark study for the modeling of ejectors has been performed. The aim has been to validate a mathematical model using techniques of CFD of an ejector with experimental data available in literature. Simulations were performed at different operating conditions in 2D and 3D geometry of an ejector on a laboratory scale as described by the model and experimental results in the literature. Different turbulence models have been tested. 2D geometry for the best results was obtained with the turbulence model SST k-e. For comparison with experimental data, the ESSS team has evaluated the ratio drag for different pressure conditions at the exit, and the pressure profile measured along the ejector wall. Three cases with different conditions of saturated steam used as the operating fluid were simulated. The results were highly satisfactory compared to experimental data, thus validating the modeling of ejectors and especially supersonic flows with characteristics.\nAn important study of two-phase flow in an annular regime within pipes has been performed. The annular flow pattern is found in different equipment for the oil industry and problems such as wear and corrosion have been identified and associated mostly near pipe accidents. This study proposed an analysis of local phenomena using CFD. The biggest challenge was in pioneering the use of CFD in this regime of multiphase flow, which has been overtaken by introduction of a gradual and fundamental study of phenomena involved in annular flow. The results showed the same patterns as found in experimental work, and highlighted the formation of liquid film on the walls of the duct. The methodology employed in the project development has opened up a promising line of research into multiphase flow.\nAnother important study considered the inclusion of LPG mixture in a Natural Gas flow. According to the curve\nof natural gas production in the Pre-salt area, there is a forecast surplus of LPG in the short and medium term, and study into logistics alternatives for the internal consumption of this product is relevant. Among the alternatives studied is the adequacy of one of the Petrobras terminals for incorporation of LPG to specified Natural Gas. To ensure the vaporization of the LPG mixture, Petrobras proposed a system with spray nozzles to facilitate contact between the phases and the consequent vaporization of LPG. Therefore, a CFD study was asked to verify the efficiency of the system. Thus, studies were performed to simulate the injection of LPG in the flow of sales gas line in order to assess the phenomena of heat transfer and mass systems using sprays without this consideration. The spray system applied in this study was a sprinkler nozzle that would meet the flow of LPG under different conditions of load loss. For definition of the beak and its characteristics, the industrial catalog of spraying system supplier products was applied.\nThe injection of LPG was taken in the flow direction of the sales gas, i.e. featuring a co-current flow. The selected LPG injection system was positioned in the center of the duct. The results showed that when using the spray, since there are droplets in the field due to the spraying process, there is an increase in the interfacial exchange area intensifying the phenomenon of heat and mass transfer, resulting in rapid mixing of LPG and sales gas. The analysis considering a system without spray showed that it required longer intervals for the total mixture of LPG to occur.\nESSS has also developed a study on heat and mass transfer in vacuum distillation columns. The model sought to evaluate the exchange of heat and mass transfer in spray sections. A detailed study of the flow in the section including the phenomena of heat and mass transfer between the liquid and vapor phases allows for a wealth of information related to fluid dynamics of interest, such as equipment, stagnation regions and hot spots, among others. The thermodynamic model to calculate the vapor-liquid equilibrium for mixtures of hydrocarbons can be defined in many ways. The proposed generic methodology was used in three different refineries, the results were validated against the results obtained from actual measurements in the units and against commercial software for the calculation of thermodynamic equilibrium. Although this software offers a much more\nsimplified approach, the comparison was important for basic model checking. The 3D model of steady state considered a Lagrangian approach for the drops what is positive for the calculation of the equilibrium between the phases. The modeling of the liquid-vapor equilibrium used employs Raoult's law which takes into account both the vapor and the liquid as ideal, or by the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation.\nThe proposed model was able to predict the occurrence of regions of exhaust steam in the equipment side. However, the ideal center where the \"wetting\" of the vapor occurs at this temperature is significantly lower than the next to the side region. The interpretation of this behavior has become more reliable when analyzing the results obtained with the mass fraction of the liquid. Exhaust regions were observed near the side justifying the high temperatures observed in the vapor phase in the near wall region. The existence of regions exhaust impairs the contact between liquid and vapor phases, and therefore, specifying the desired product could not be achieved. This developed innovative modeling was useful for Petrobras to assess the traditional designs of distillation columns.\nRefer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas\n\u25a0\tMARTINS, A.
