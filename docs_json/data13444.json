The main objective of this thesis was to \n\ndescribe the sex-driven foraging patterns of a pelagic top predator - Cory\u2019s \n\nShearwater, Calonectris borealis - breeding in the small island of Berlengas, \n\nPortugal, during the chick-rearing seasons of 2010-2014. We identified the \n\nenvironmental predictors that determine the selection of foraging areas by \n\nfemale and male Cory\u2019s Shearwaters and the role of breeding experience in this \n\nprocess. This medium-term study also assessed, in a scenario of climate \n\nstochasticity, the ecological impacts of climatic conditions in marine \n\nenvironments and the possible change in the distribution of this species in the \n\nNorth Atlantic, considering the increase in sea surface temperature and given \n\nthe vulnerability of seabird predators to extreme climatic events. We studied the \n\nforaging distribution of fifty-five male and female Cory\u2019s shearwaters with GPS \n\ntracking devices during the chick-rearing period between 2010 \u2013 2014, and \n\naccessed their trophic choices with stable isotope analysis (SIA) of their \n\nplasma. The study sample was also divided between experienced and \n\ninexperienced individuals using the total number of breeding attempts as a \n\nproxy for experience, and the prediction that reproductive success typically \n\nincreases with breeding age and experience in seabirds. This study benefited \n\nfrom a long-term database of the breeding population, such that minimum age, \n\nsex and previous breeding experience were known for most of the individuals. \n\nWe found spatial segregation of female versus male Cory\u2019s Shearwaters as well \n\nas inexperienced versus experienced breeders, which increased during the last \n\n\n\n \n\nIV \n\ncouple of years. Males relied heavily on static variables like the bathymetry of \n\nthe area, while females were much more explorative, having a different \n\ncombination and weighting of important variables (i.e. productivity proxies). \n\nFemales undertook much larger foraging journeys than males, in years of \n\ngreater environmental stochasticity. Finally, climate stochasticity might have a \n\nsignificant influence on the spatial distribution of the species, exercising greater \n\ninfluence on male and experienced individuals (i.e. the group showing a more \n\nstatic distribution). Nevertheless, the true effects of such large-scale events \n\ncannot be encompassed on such a short-term study, making the continuity of \n\nmonitoring the foraging ecology of this species crucial to understand the impact \n\nof climate change on this and other marine taxa. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Sex-driven foraging segregation, Breeding experience, Calonectris \n\nborealis. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nV \n\nResumo \n\nUm conhecimento dos padr\u00f5es da ecologia de aves marinhas, representa uma \n\ncontribui\u00e7\u00e3o importante para compreender quais as \u00e1reas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndestas aves e o porqu\u00ea de estas as escolherem. Permite ainda conhecer, de \n\nque modo \u00e9 que a presen\u00e7a de condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais adversas influencia o \n\ncomportamento destas aves. O principal objetivo desta tese foi descrever os \n\npadr\u00f5es comportamentais de ambos os sexos de um predador pel\u00e1gico, tendo \n\ncomo modelo de estudo a Cagarra, Calonectris borealis, reprodutores na \n\npequena ilha da Berlenga, Portugal, durante o per\u00edodo de desenvolvimento das \n\ncrias de 2010 a 2014. Foram identificados os principais fatores ambientais que \n\ninfluenciam a sele\u00e7\u00e3o e os seus padr\u00f5es de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, e qual o papel do \n\nsexo e da experi\u00eancia de indiv\u00edduos nestas escolhas. Este estudo de m\u00e9dio-\n\nprazo tamb\u00e9m reflete, num cen\u00e1rio de mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas, os impactos \n\necol\u00f3gicos que estes ter\u00e3o em ambientes marinhos e a qual a poss\u00edvel \n\naltera\u00e7\u00e3o na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o desta esp\u00e9cie no Atl\u00e2ntico Norte, considerando o \n\naumento da temperatura da superf\u00edcie do mar e a vulnerabilidade destes \n\npredadores face a eventos clim\u00e1ticos extremos. Para dar resposta a estes \n\nobjetivos, utilizamos dispositivos GPS para acompanhar indiv\u00edduos desta \n\npopula\u00e7\u00e3o durante os quatro anos deste estudo e comparamos os resultados \n\ncom a sua ecologia tr\u00f3pica atrav\u00e9s de an\u00e1lises isot\u00f3picas. Em seguida, \n\nanalisamos as diferen\u00e7as na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e comportamental de \n\ncinquenta e cinco indiv\u00edduos pertencentes a esta popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Cagarras \n\nreprodutoras na costa litoral portuguesa. O grupo foi dividido entre indiv\u00edduos \n\nexperientes e inexperientes usando o n\u00famero total de tentativas de \n\nacasalamento como um indicador para a experi\u00eancia, e a suposi\u00e7\u00e3o de que o \n\n\n\n \n\nVI \n\nsucesso reprodutivo normalmente aumenta com a idade e a experi\u00eancia em \n\naves marinhas. Este estudo beneficiou de um conhecimento de longo prazo da \n\npopula\u00e7\u00e3o alvo, sabendo a priori dados como a idade m\u00ednima das aves, o sexo \n\ne o historial do sucesso reprodutor para a maioria dos indiv\u00edduos. Atrav\u00e9s da \n\nan\u00e1lise de is\u00f3topos de azoto e carbono do plasma e sangue destas aves, \n\ninferimos qual o efeito da experi\u00eancia de um individuo na sele\u00e7\u00e3o de presas na \n\nsua ecologia tr\u00f3fica. Os resultados confirmam a exist\u00eancia de segrega\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nespaciais entre machos e f\u00eameas, assim como de aves experientes e \n\ninexperiente. As principais vari\u00e1veis ambientais que influenciaram a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nespacial de indiv\u00edduos do sexo feminino foram a dist\u00e2ncia \u00e0 col\u00f3nia e a \n\ntemperatura da superf\u00edcie do mar, fazendo com que adotem um \n\ncomportamento mais explorat\u00f3rio e pel\u00e1gico em anos de maior estocacidade. \n\nPor sua vez, nos indiv\u00edduos do sexo masculino essas vari\u00e1veis dizem respeito \n\n\u00e0 profundidade da \u00e1gua e das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de clorofila a. Os resultados \n\ndeste estudo mostram ainda que o aquecimento global pode exercer influ\u00eancia \n\nsignificativa sobre a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial da Cagarra, especialmente em aves \n\nexperientes (que apresentam uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o mais est\u00e1tica). No entanto, os \n\nverdadeiros efeitos de tais eventos de grande escala n\u00e3o podem ser \n\nenglobados num estudo de t\u00e3o pequena dura\u00e7\u00e3o, tornando a continuidade de \n\nmonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gica desta esp\u00e9cie cruciais para entender o impacto das \n\nmudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas sobre este grupo de animais marinhos. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Segrega\u00e7\u00e3o espacial, Experi\u00eancia reprodutiva, Calonectris \n\nborealis \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n\nList of Tables \n\n \n\n \n\nTable I \u2013 Mean regional and local environmental predictors in the colony \n\nsurroundings of female and male Cory\u2019s shearwaters from Berlenga between \n\n2010 and 2014 ................................................................................................  39 \n\n \n\nTable II \u2013 Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models (GLMMs) testing the effect \n\nof the interaction between year and sex on regional and local environmental \n\npredictors in the colony surroundings  .............................................................. 40 \n\n \n\nTable III \u2013 Estimated overlap (Bhattacharyya's Affinity, BA) between male and \n\nfemale Cory\u2019s shearwaters Kernel Utilisation Distributions (Kernel UD) ..........  42 \n\n \n\nTable IV \u2013 Parameter estimates from Generalized Additive Mixed Models fitted \n\nto the Area Restricted Search behaviour of female and male Cory\u2019s shearwaters \n\nshowing the ranking on the candidate?models based on the corrected Akaike \n\nInformation Criteria (AICc) ...............................................................................  43 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nVIII \n\nList of Figures \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 GPS tracking devices CatTraq Travel Loggers .............................  27 \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Fieldwork procedures at the breeding colony ................................. 28 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Home range and foraging areas of male and female Cory\u2019s \n\nshearwaters during the chick-rearing seasons of 2010-2014.  ........................  41 \n\n \n\nFigure 4  \u2013 Generalized Additive Mixed Model representation   .....................  44 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter I - Introduction \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n1.1  Marine environment and Marine top predators \n\nMarine environment ecosystems are complex adaptive systems, among the \n\nmost diverse on Earth, linked across multiple scales by flow of water and \n\nspecies movements (Levin and Lubchenco 2008). The immense oceans \n\nencompass habitats ranging from highly productive coastal regions to much \n\nless productive deep-sea environments. Taking into account the size of such \n\necosystems, their resources are sparse and scattered over large areas, making \n\ntheir location largely unpredictable (Weimerskirch et al. 2007). Oceans are \n\nsubdivided into several ecosystems based on different characteristics of depth, \n\noceanography, productivity and populations of organisms that are linked in \n\ntrophic food chains and webs (Sherman 1993). They also experience seasonal \n\npatterns in primary productivity, particularly at higher latitudes, leading to \n\nchanges in predator distributions. As marine productivity tends to be distributed \n\nheterogeneously, with high productive areas located close to specific locations \n\nsuch as shelf edges or coastal upwellings (Ainley and Boekelheide 1990; Bakun \n\n1990; Crawford 2007), marine organisms such as fish are found in patches of \n\ndifferent sizes, depending on the process concentrating them and on the \n\nspecific behaviour of the species.  Oceanographic phenomena such as ocean \n\ncurrents, winds or river influx introduce varying complexities in the interlinkages \n\nbetween biotic components and environmental characteristics especially in the \n\ncoastal waters (Chen et al. 2004; Tweddle et al. 2010; Wetz and Wheeler \n\n2004). Wind-driven coastal upwellings consists on the rise of cold and deep \n\nsubsurface waters that are rich in nutrients, and contribute for an increase in the \n\ndensity of primary producers such as phytoplankton, which will consequentially \n\nattract zooplankton, followed by zoo \u2013 and phyto \u2013 planktivorous pelagic fish \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nwhich in turn will attract top predators such as large fish, cetaceans or seabirds \n\n(Malik et al. 2015). Such diversity in vertebrate and invertebrate communities \n\nallow top marine predators such as seabirds to specialize, coping with this \n\nunpredictable location of prey by adopting specific foraging strategies perfected \n\nby strong natural selection processes (Hunt &amp; Schneider 1987; Weimerskirch \n\n2007). Within such diverse and dynamic environments, animals seek highly \n\nproductive areas, by changing their foraging grounds and strategies, \n\ndetermined by species dispersal capacity and energy requirements, which may \n\nvary during the annual cycle (Green et al. 2009). Altering foraging grounds also \n\ndepends on food availability in order to fulfil their energetic requirements and, \n\nconsequently, maximizing fitness (Polovina et al. 2001; P\u00e9ron et al. 2010). \n\nTop marine predators are important top consumers in marine environments, \n\nhaving major influence in ecological processes that occur in these ecosystems \n\n(Scheriber and Burger 2001; Werner 2010; Paiva et al. 2013a). Such predator, \n\nincluding marine mammals, large teleosts, seabirds and sharks, occupy high \n\ntrophic levels in marine habitats, and have been declining worldwide (e.g. Estes \n\net al. 2006; Myers and Worm 2003; Baum et al. 2003; Pauly et al. 1998). Many \n\nstudies show that the decline of these populations can have cascading effects \n\non lower trophic levels on both coastal and pelagic areas (Myers and Worm \n\n2003; Scheffer et al. 2005; Heithaus et al. 2008).  In fact, declines in top \n\npredator abundance often alleviate predation pressure on meso-consumers, \n\nwhich indirectly increase the mortality rate of resource species (Myers et al. \n\n2007; Scheffer et al. 2005). The loss of top predators is thus predicted to cause \n\nnumerical increases in meso-consumers and declines in resource species. Due \n\nto the position and importance that top predators undertake in the food chain, \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nthey usually are considered indicators of the status and performance of the \n\nmarine ecosystems. These conditions also qualify them as good subjects for \n\necological studies and favour the development of research programs aimed at \n\nidentifying and analysing any trends that could lead to the better understanding \n\nand management of marine ecosystems, potentially preventing deregulation of \n\necological processes and disruption of ecosystem services (Block et al. 2011). \n\nGiven the conspicuity of seabirds as marine predators, they play an important \n\nrole as sentinel organisms because unexpected changes in their numbers, \n\nhealth or breeding success provide an alarm that may indicate an unknown \n\npollution or food supply problem (Furness and Camphuysen 1997).  \n\n \n\n1.2  Procellariiformes seabirds  \n\nThe tubenosed seabirds (albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters) are well \n\nknown for their pelagic wide-ranging lifestyle. These long-living cosmopolitan \n\nbirds spend most of their life at sea and are tied to small oceanic islands only \n\nfor breeding (Dell\u2019ariccia et al. 2010). The Procellariiformes order includes four \n\nfamilies: Hydrobatidae (storm petrels), Pelecanoididae (diving petrels), \n\nDiomedeidae (albatrosses), and Procellariidae (shearwaters), and has the most \n\nlong-lived species among birds (Bried 2003; Werner 2010). Generally, most \n\nspecies belonging to this group are colonial and gather annually in large \n\nnumbers at somewhat few locations in order to reproduce (Piatt and Sydeman \n\n2007). They present extreme life history strategies, such as the laying of a \n\nsingle egg per breeding season, followed by a long incubation and chick rearing \n\nperiod (Warham 1990; Schreiber &amp; Burger 2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nThe evolution of aggregated breeding systems, generally referred to as \n\ncolonies, is believed to have benefited from information exchange, cooperation, \n\nefficient defence against predators and several other benefits (Wittenberger and \n\nHunt 1985; Danchin and Wagner 1997; Brown and Brown 2001). Breeding is \n\ngenerally considered one of the most energy-consuming phase because of the \n\nhigh resource expenditure that it involves (egg production, nest attendance etc) \n\nand the constraints that it generates. Pelagic birds are true sea travellers during \n\nmost of the year, but during the breeding season are central place foragers that \n\nneed to return to the colony regularly, to incubate their eggs or attend their \n\nchicks. During this period, they are forced to commute between their colonies \n\nand pelagic feeding zones at sea to provision their offspring (i.e. central-place \n\nforaging behaviour; Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1990). This strategy imposes \n\nenergetic constraints which limit foraging range and thus accessibility of certain \n\nmarine habitats. Breeding occurs generally during summer, when productivity is \n\nhighest. During the non-breeding season, birds can disperse over wide areas or \n\nmigrate to completely different habitats as they no longer need to be central-\n\nplace foragers (Shaffer et al. 2006; Bost et al. 2009a; Egevang et al. 2010).  \n\nDespite the advantages of breeding in large aggregations, there are \n\ndistinct costs such as competition for resources or disease transmission, and \n\nthe complex trade-off between costs and benefits leads to large variation in \n\ncolony size across species, space and time (Wittenberger and Hunt 1985; \n\nBrown and Brown 2001).  Although a great understanding of these animal\u2019s life \n\nstyle and their functional ecology in environments with high unpredictability of \n\nfood resources, has been achieved in the last decades, most of the information \n\nregarding the group is based on the reproductive phase of their life cycles. Such \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nknowledge has been gathered especially during the chick-rearing period, when \n\nfood and energy demand is augmented, and when the birds have their \n\ndistribution restricted to the surroundings of their breeding colonies, making \n\nthem easier to handle and track (Paiva et al. 2010a; Haug 2015). Throughout \n\nthe non-breeding season, seabirds are not bound to return to their nests, and \n\nusually take on migratory routes that can cover many thousands of kilometres \n\ninto remote oceanic areas. Due to the inherent difficulty in equipping and \n\ntracking seabirds for a long period of time, and through such distances, \n\ninformation about the non-breeding period is still relatively scarce (i.e. when \n\ncompared to the breeding season; Wilson et al. 2002).  \n\n \n\n1.3  Environmental variability  \n\nIt is known that seabirds forage over conspicuous regions, where ocean \n\nproductivity is naturally enhanced due to several oceanographic features and \n\nprocesses, which include upwelling areas associated with continental shelves \n\n(Louzao et al. 2006) or seamounts (Morato et al. 2008b); water mass properties \n\nlike temperature (Paiva et al. 2010b) or salinity (Ainley et al. 2005); processes \n\nlike tidal currents (Becker et al. 1983; Hunt et al. 1998); fronts (Spear et al. \n\n2001; Bost et al. 2009) and thermoclines (Navarro &amp; Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds 2009); \n\ndistance to shore (Briggs et al. 1987) or colony (Hunt Jr. 1997); and wind \n\nconditions (Garthe et al. 2009). Tremblay et al. (2009) concluded that the \n\nrelative importance of diverse environmental predictors of marine productivity \n\ndepend on several factors, such as the species considered, sex, breeding \n\nstatus, locality and scale of the study. It is most likely that Procellariiformes take \n\nadvantage of their dimethyl sulphide (DMS) olfactory capabilities in searching \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nfor advantageous areas (Nevitt 1999; Nevitt et al. 2002), and then might use \n\nvisual cues to locate prey at smaller scales (Tremblay et al. 2009). \n\nThese processes have been affected greatly by climate change, which is \n\nclosely related to large-scale atmospheric phenomena, correlating changes \n\nobserved in atmospheric circulation with changes in oceanic circulation. This \n\ntypically leads to harsh outcomes in biological processes throughout food webs \n\nall across the oceans. One of the best known large-scale atmospheric \n\nphenomena associated with climate change is the North Atlantic Oscillation \n\n(NAO) (reviewed by Stenseth et al. 2003). The NAO refers to a north?south \n\nalternation in atmospheric mass between the subtropical Atlantic and the Arctic \n\nand therefore involves desynchronised behaviours between the climatological \n\nlow-pressure centre near Iceland and the high-pressure centre near the Azores \n\n(Hurrell et al. 2003). The effects of NAO over the north Atlantic varies regionally \n\n(Stenseth et al. 2003). For instance, along the Portuguese Current system a \n\nnegative NAO index indicate a perceptible decrease in the sea surface \n\ntemperature (SST), caused by strong winds that toughen the upwelling \n\nphenomenon. This in turn can be related to an overall increase in abundance \n\nand accessibility of marine organisms from lower trophic levels, to top marine \n\npredators (Mann &amp; Lazier 2006). \n\nPaiva et al. (2013a) concluded that dramatic changes in the distribution and \n\nforaging behaviour of Cory\u2019s shearwaters during 2010, comparatively to \n\nprevious years seems to have been mostly related to a climatic event that \n\noccurred during the winter of 2009-2010. This climatic phenomenon was clearly \n\ndepicted by a record-breaking negative NAO index (Osborn 2011), which \n\nsignificantly affected the productivity and decreased the abundance of pelagic \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nprey fish, which in turn altered the foraging and feeding ecology of Cory\u2019s \n\nshearwaters and decreased their reproductive success. These negative trends \n\nin the abundance of pelagic prey cause great concern because not only does \n\nthe NAO affect these lower trophic organisms but they also suffer the influence \n\nof intensive commercial fishing activities. (Paiva et al. 2013a). Overall, It seems \n\nthat for the Portuguese Current system, moderate either negative or positive \n\nvalues of the extended winter NAO index are indicative of higher prey \n\navailability months latter (i.e. spring-summer), when Cory\u2019s shearwaters are \n\nbreeding. While more severe (i.e. far from zero), either negative or positive, \n\nextended winter NAO index values leading to a notorious decrease in prey \n\navailability, and thus an altered foraging pattern and low reproductive success \n\nfor Cory\u2019s shearwaters (Paiva et al. 2013a; Haugh et al. 2015). \n\n \n\n1.4 Trophic markers \n\nUnderstand and reporting how animals exploit their environment and how \n\nthey cope with seasonal variation in resource abundance has been a major \n\nquestion in ecology (Johnson 1980; Wilcove &amp; Wikelski 2008). Migratory \n\nanimals depend on multiple regions (e.g.,non-breeding, breeding and migratory \n\nstop-over sites) and therefore these species may be more vulnerable to \n\nenvironmental perturbations than sedentary species (Wilcove &amp; Wikelski 2008; \n\nForman &amp; Godron 1986; Kelly et al. 2005). For example, anthropogenic \n\nalteration within a species\u2019 breeding range may cause decreased breeding \n\nsuccess (Robinson &amp; Wilcove 1994) and disturbance at stop-over sites may \n\naffect the ability to refill fat reserves (Blem 1980; Moore et al. 1995). Hence, \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nconservation management of animal populations depends on an understanding \n\nof these trophic and spatial ecology behaviours (Aarts et al. 2008).  \n\nAs previously stated, marine ecosystems are highly heterogeneous \n\nenvironments in which productivity is controlled by physical features and \n\nprocesses, and the spatial ecology of seabirds at sea will have a direct \n\ninfluence on the prey that these animals exploit and consequently on their diet \n\ncomposition (Haury et al. 1978). The study of seabird foraging behaviour has \n\nalways been hampered by the problem of assessing at-sea distribution, \n\nindividuals being particularly difficult to track (Votier et al. 2010). Stable isotopic \n\nanalysis (SIA) of biological tissues are often used to measure the isotopic \n\nsignatures of seabirds and thus interpret their trophic choices. The rationale of \n\nusing SIA is generally based on the assumption that when stable isotope \n\nsignatures are incorporated in the proteins of consumers, they reflect those of \n\nthe proteins in their diet in a predictable manner (Post 2002; Bearhop et al. \n\n2004). \n\nStable isotope signatures can then be a fundamental alternative to the \n\nconventional ways of analysing diets, i.e. through collecting stomach contents \n\nor faeces (Cherel et al. 2007), and may simplify the monitoring of changes in \n\nmarine ecosystems. Stable isotope ratios of Carbon (\n13\n\nC/\n12\n\nC, ?\n13\n\nC) and \n\nNitrogen (\n15\n\nN/\n14\n\nN, ?\n15\n\nN) are most commonly used in seabird stable isotope \n\necology (Ramos and Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds 2012). The use of ?\n15\n\nN is based on the \n\ntrophic richness of \n15\n\nN as we go up on the trophic web (Forero and Hobson \n\n2003).  According to Bond and Jones (2009), in each trophic level the \n15\n\nN \n\nvalues increase 3 to 5% due to the production of urea, since the \n14\n\nN is \n\npreferentially excreted in comparison with \n15\n\nN. On the other hand, the use of \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n?\n13\n\nC on the marine environment is based on the \n13\n\nC gradient, because \n13\n\nC \n\nenriches from offshore to inshore regions, from benthic to pelagic strata of the \n\nwater column and with decreasing latitude, allowing ?\n13\n\nC to behave like a \n\ngeographical indicator of foraging habitats (Cherel, Hobson &amp; Weimerskirch \n\n2000; Forero and Hobson 2003, Quillfeldt, McGill &amp; Furness 2005; Cherel et al. \n\n2006). \n\nDepending on tissue-specific isotopic turnover, stable isotope \n\nmeasurements reflect average dietary records over days (blood plasma) to \n\nyears (feathers) and have thus the potential to portrait nutritional variation at \n\ndifferent time-scales (Dalerum &amp; Angerbj\u00f6rn 2005) as isotopic forms are \n\nfractioned and incorporated in new formed tissue through diet at specific \n\ntemporal or spatial scales (Cherel et al. 2007). For instance, feathers allow us to \n\nanalyse a period of information correspondent to the time of feather growth but, \n\nin contrast, red blood cells represents a period of a few weeks and plasma to \n\nabout 7 days (Cherel et al. 2005; Hobson 2005). To infer geographical positions \n\nwith isotopic analyses, the most reliable materials are those that are \n\nmetabolically inactive so they retain signatures during a fixed growth period \n\n(Hobson 2005). As reported by Forero and Hobson (2003), keratinous materials \n\nsuch as feathers are particularly suitable because keratin is metabolically \n\ninactive and conserves dietary signals integrated over the period in which they \n\ngrew. Moult patterns of bird feathers are seasonally predictable and consistent \n\nover time (Inger and Bearhop 2008; Ramos et al. 2009). \n\nThe great benefit of using such techniques over stomach regurgitations for \n\ninstance, is that it provides not only information about the food ingested in the \n\nsort-term (like a snapshot picture of the individual diet) but also the food that \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nwas assimilated by tissues (from short- to long-term depending on the tissue). \n\nConventional dietary analysis are also more prone to misinterpretations of the \n\nproportions of some food sources, due to the diverse rates of digestion of \n\ndifferent prey types. Lastly the gathering of feather and/or blood samples is less \n\nstressful for the bird than the collection of diet samples by flushing their \n\nstomach contents (Paiva et al. 2010a).  \n\n \n\n1.5  Tracking devices \n\nSeabirds spend most of their time at sea and are challenging to observe \n\nwhen not attending nests during the breeding season. Although they are \n\nconsidered the most threatened group of birds worldwide, conservation efforts \n\nwere traditionally centred on threats faced at their breeding grounds (Ramirez et \n\nal. 2008) which are beneficial but highly insufficient, lacking the insight of the \n\nquality, location and extent of their feeding grounds which have crucial \n\nimportance for the breeding success and survival of these marine top predators \n\n(Davis et al. 2005).    Research has been therefore biased toward land-based \n\nobservations, with the at-sea biology of smaller species generally limited to \n\ncounts of travelling and foraging birds from opportunistic or research vessels \n\nwhich has also provided insight into the distribution and at-sea behaviour of \n\nthese animals. Such studies are time or area restricted and unable to give \n\ndetailed insights, such as distinguishing breeding status, sex or even species \n\n(Grecian et al. 2012), limiting the data and insights of the foraging behaviour of \n\nsuch individuals (Weimerskirch et al. 2005a). Also, the presence of vessels \n\nalters the normal behaviour of the birds and are normally associated with high \n\ncosts (Grecian et al. 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nHowever, knowledge of foraging behaviour is essential to understand both \n\nthe ecological roles of seabirds and constraints acting upon them in marine \n\necosystems (Wilson et al. 2002). The most productive and cost-effective way to \n\nstudy the flight and foraging behaviour of birds at sea employs electronic \n\ndevices attached to individuals (Wilson et al. 2002; Daunt et al. 2003; Garthe et \n\nal. 2007). A variety of loggers and techniques have been revolutionizing the \n\nstudy of habitat foraging and selection, being developed and improved during \n\nthe last 40 years (Gr\u00e9millet et al. 2000; Hamer et al. 2007; Weimerskirch and \n\nWilson 2000), equipped with increasing availability of remotely sensed data, \n\ncomputation power and the sophistication of analytical methods (Fauchald &amp; \n\nTverraa 2003; Ballance et al. 2006, Tremblay et al. 2009). \n\nSince 1990 there was an upgrade of the technology used to study seabird \n\necology at sea, with the use of satellite telemetry (platform terminal transmitters \n\n[PTTs]), accurate devices (1-3 km) with solar power improved lifespan that do \n\nnot require recovery for data processing. (Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1990). \n\nPresently two types of devices are heavily used to study seabirds: Global \n\nlocation sensing or geolocation (GLS) and global positioning system (GPS). \n\nGeolocation uses changes in ambient light levels to estimate sunrise, sunset, \n\nday length, and hence, longitude and latitude. The spatial resolution of these \n\ndevices can be improved with the addition of temperature sensors to record \n\nlong range movements (Burger &amp; Shaffer 2008). One of the most recent \n\ntracking devices to come on line are GPS devices. These are unlimited in range \n\nand are capable of much higher resolution and accuracy than satellite \n\ntransmitters or conventional radio telemetry (Hulbert and French 2001; \n\nH\u00fcnerbein et al. 2000). As with most new technologies, the first GPS data \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nloggers were too heavy to deploy on all but very large-bodied seabirds such as \n\nalbatrosses (Diomedae; (Waugh et al. 2005; Weimerskirch et al. 2002) and \n\ngannets (Sulidae; (Gr\u00e9millet et al. 2004). The possibility of recording locations \n\nevery second at accuracies within meters of true location and, the rather \n\ninexpensive price and small size of such devices have made them suitable \n\nenough to be used in several seabird species. The latest equipment, with \n\npackage sizes in the range of 8-12 g, bring small and medium-sized seabirds (c. \n\n300 g and larger) into the scope of possible applications. Currently, attachment \n\nof miniaturized sensors linked to data loggers has been popularized since these \n\nloggers do not call for long-distance signal reception and are lightweight devices \n\nwith unmatched precision useful for identifying key habitat areas. However, as \n\nwith GPS or GLS recorders, the limitation is that birds have to be recaptured or \n\npass close to a remote data-recovery system to download the information, and \n\nthus involves a risk of losing data (Wilson et al. 2007, Burger &amp; Shaffer 2008). \n\nThe only time where birds faithfully return to the colony is during the breeding \n\nseason, so most of the information available is restricted to this period of their \n\nlife cycle. Tracking studies should control for adverse effects of the transmitter \n\nload and biases, and although it has been questioned (Barron et al. 2010, \n\nKidawa et al. 2011) Burger and Shaffer (2008) propose a guideline, recognizing \n\nthat behavioural and fitness changes can be avoided by keeping the transmitter \n\nweight below 3% of the bird\u2019s body weight (Phillips et al. 2003). The studies \n\nperformed by using this type of technology has already contributed significantly \n\nto conservation planning and monitoring of several species according to BirdLife \n\nInternational (www.birdlife.org/). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n1.6 Foraging strategies in relation to age and breeding experience \n\nMarine predator foraging behaviour depends largely on the distribution, \n\nabundance and reliability of their prey (Staniland et al. 2006), but also on \n\nintrinsic factors such as body mass, sex (Hindell et al. 1991; Kato et al. 2008) \n\nand breeding stage (Shaffer et al. 2003). As seen before, marine food \n\nresources are scarce and often patchily distributed (Weimerskirch et al. 2007), \n\nwith this, clutches of a single egg and the development pattern of chicks, \n\npredominantly the prolonged nestling period resulting from slow growth, and the \n\nlarge accumulation of fat, are among some of the adaptations to such an \n\nunpredictable environments (Boersma &amp; Parrish 1998). Foraging behaviour and \n\nflexibility in the diet is particularly important, as it allows individuals to exploit \n\nshifting prey diversity and adjust to changing spatio-temporal distributions of \n\nprey (Bowen et al. 2006; Montevecchi et al. 2009). Although studies focusing on \n\nseabirds during the last decades have multiplied immensely, the vast majority of \n\nthis work has been focused on breeding individuals (Votier et al. 2011). This \n\ntendency is due to the fact that breeders represent an important part of the \n\npopulation and are more likely to return to the colony, increasing the chances \n\nfor logger retrieval. Seabirds have a long life spans and an extensive period of \n\nimmaturity (Burger &amp; Shaffer 2008) corresponding up to 50% of the non-\n\nbreeding adults of the population (Klomp &amp; Furness 1992). Generally these \n\nnon-breeders attend the colonies along with the breeders for most, if not all the \n\nbreeding season, but these inexperienced and failed breeders are not \n\nnecessarily forced as central place foragers since they have no duties at the \n\ncolony/nest. Therefore the prospect to adapt a more explorative foraging \n\nbehaviour at sea and rely on different areas than the rest of the population is \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nthen possible. Immature individuals normally show higher dispersal rates when \n\ncompared with breeders (Huyvaert &amp; Anderson 2004) and it\u2019s generally \n\nbelieved that the lower breeding success of younger birds is at least partially \n\nassociated to lower foraging success (Forslund &amp; P\u00e4rt 1995), but there are very \n\nfew studies which compare the foraging efficiency of experienced and \n\ninexperienced individuals (Weimerskirch et al. 2005a).  \n\nHowever, there is no golden rule to such tendencies. Some exceptions have \n\nbeen observed, showing that young inexperienced wandering albatrosses \n\n(Diomedae exulans) had similar foraging success when compared to \n\nexperienced adults, differing only on their foraging strategies (Weimerskirch et \n\nal. 2005b). Some exceptions include the aforementioned study, which found \n\nthat young, inexperienced wandering albatrosses (Diomedae exulans) actually \n\nhad similar foraging success to that of experienced adults, but differed in their \n\nstrategies. Inexperienced birds foraged more intensively and found more prey \n\nduring the night. In another study by Bunce et al. (2005) on Australasian \n\ngannets (Morus serrator), it was interestingly found that inexperienced breeders \n\nhad lower breeding success only when food availability was scarce, though this \n\nwas not evident in a later and perhaps more detailed work on the same species \n\n(Pyk et al. 2007). Other studies show that immature gannets (Morus bassanus) \n\nbreeding on the British Isles, (Votier et al. 2011) can disperse widely, potentially \n\nexploring other colonies, but mainly acted as central place foragers when \n\ncompared with experienced breeders. While first time breeders of black-browed \n\nalbatross (Talassarche melanophrys) had lower reproductive success and lower \n\nsurvival rates when compared with older, more experienced individuals (Nevoux \n\net al. 2007). With such disperse results, it is believed that foraging efficiency \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\ndevelops and increases with age and experience (Zimmer et al. 2011; Le \n\nVaillant et al. 2013; Gutowsky et al. 2014), possibly leading to the notion that \n\nsome species have such an extended period of immaturity that they are efficient \n\nforagers by the time they start breeding (Weimerskirch et al. 2005a; \n\nWeimerskirch et al. 2014).  \n\n \n\n1.7  Foraging sexual segregation \n\nSegregation of males and females is particularly common in marine central \n\nplace foragers during the breeding period, when foraging ranges are restricted \n\nby the need to return repeatedly to the breeding site to care for offspring (Page \n\net al. 2005, Weimerskirch et al. 2009). Sexual segregation is thought to reveal \n\ncompetitive exclusion by the dominant sex, or to reflect niche specialisation \n\n(Phillips et al. 2004) but could also be a consequence of differing parental roles \n\n(Thaxter et al. 2009, Elliott et al. 2010) or differences in the nutritional \n\nrequirements of males and females as proposed by Lewis et al. (2002).  Many \n\nstudies show that males and females exploit different prey species or habitats, \n\nreflecting in between-sex differences in isotopic signatures (Bearhop et al. \n\n2006, Phillips et al. 2011).  \n\nForaging segregation can occur at various spatial scales, ranging from \n\ndifferences in local habitat use to broad geographical distributions (Catry et al. \n\n2005). A recent study by Cleasby et al. (2015) provides clear evidence of sexual \n\nsegregation in northern gannets (Morus bassanus), where males and females \n\ndiffered in their usage of mixed and stratified waters, proving sex-specific \n\nhabitat segregation across tidal mixing regimes. Other sexual differences in the \n\nforaging behaviour of seabirds are often related to sexual size dimorphism \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nfound in many species such as the giant petrels (Macronectes spp; Gonz\u00e1les-\n\nSol\u00eds et al. 2000) Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans; Weimerskirch et al. \n\n1993; Weimerskirch 1995) and Gray-headed Albatross (T. chrysostoma; Phillips \n\net al. 2004). In some seabirds, sexual dimorphism in body mass and wing \n\nmorphology is thought to play a functional role in flight performance and is used \n\nto explain differences in distribution of males and females at sea at least for part \n\nof the year (Phillips et al 2004). However, sexual differences in size and shape \n\nmay be poor predictors of differentiation in the way male and female seabirds \n\nexploit the marine environment. In some species with considerable sexual \n\ndimorphism, such as the Cory\u2019s Shearwater (Calonectris borealis) recent \n\nstudies show that pronounced sexual size dimorphism in bill size, body mass \n\nand wing-length has no apparent connection to foraging behaviour and feeding \n\necology, at least during the stage of incubation (Navarro et al. 2009; Ramos et \n\nal. 2009).  Therefore inspecting other stages of this species life cycle, is \n\nnecessary to understand if sexual segregation and sexual behaviour is due to \n\nsexual dimorphism or environmental factors such as food resources. Moreover, \n\nthe influence of sex on the feeding ecology of seabirds may also be related with \n\nthe experience of the individual, and, in this study we try also to relate these two \n\nvariables, sex and breeding experience, in describing the foraging ecology of \n\nthe birds. \n\n \n\n1.8  Study questions \n\n We deployed GPS-loggers in male and female (also inexperienced and \n\nexperienced) Cory\u2019s shearwaters during September of 2010 \u2013 2014 (i.e. mid \n\nchick-rearing period), in order to disentangle possible intersexual segregation \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\non the foraging strategies, at-sea distribution and trophic ecology of this \n\nspecies. We specifically wanted to answer a three-fold question: (1) Do female \n\nCory\u2019s shearwaters differ from males in their foraging strategies and \n\ndistribution? Until now, most studies reported the inexistence of inter-sexual \n\ndifferences (e.g. Navarro &amp; Gonz\u00e1lez-S\u00f3lis 2009, Paiva et al. 2010a, but see \n\nRamos et al. 2009 and Navarro et al. 2009 for a counterpoint), especially during \n\nthe chick-rearing phase when the task of provisioning the growing chick is \n\nequally shared between sexes; (2) Will both sexes react differently to life history \n\ntrait factors, such as environmental stochasticity and breeding experience? We \n\nexpect females to react more obviously to annual changes of productivity in the \n\ncolony surroundings, and thus exploit more pelagic waters, like they do during \n\nthe pre-laying exodus when they segregate from males (Paiva et a. 2013a, \n\nHaug et al. 2015). Moreover, inexperienced individuals should exhibit higher \n\nvalues on foraging effort parameters (e.g. maximum distance to colony), \n\nespecially during years of poor productivity on the colony surroundings (Haug et \n\nal. 2015); (3) Will the inter-sexual foraging segregation translate into isotopic \n\nsegregation and differential body condition between sexes? In this species, like \n\nfor other marine predators, spatial segregation usually leads to isotopic \n\nsegregation, through the exploitation of different baseline isoscapes (Graham et \n\nal. 2010), through the choice of feeding on isotopically different prey species \n\n(Paiva et al. 2010b) or a combination of both. A higher foraging effort usually \n\nresults into lower adult body condition and overall breeding success (Paiva et \n\nal. 2013a). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 - Methods \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n \n\n2 2.1 Study Area \n\n2.1.1 Berlengas archipelago \n\nThe Berlengas archipelago is located in the Portuguese coast, at \n\napproximately 10Km west of the town of Peniche, in the north Atlantic. The \n\nlargest Island of the archipelago is the granitic skerry called Berlenga Island \n\n(39\u00b012\u201940\u2019\u201949N, 09\u00b030\u201929\u2019\u2019W), that reaches an altitude of 88m, with a maximum \n\nlength of 1,5Km and a total area of 78,8ha. Two groups of smaller Islets called \n\nEstelas and Farilh\u00f5es are also part of the archipelago and, together with \n\nBerlenga, are the three main dry land extensions of the area. The archipelago \n\nreached the status of natural reserve in 1981 by the Portuguese government \n\nand since then, the islands passed through successive improvements on total \n\narea covered and conservation importance, which culminated in June 28th \n\n2011, when the Berlengas Natural Reserve (R.N.B.) was included in the World \n\nNetwork of Biosphere Reserves (W.N.B.R.), under positive ruling of UNESCO \n\n(Santos et al. 2012).  \n\nThe entire archipelago presents high biodiversity, with 76 fish species \n\ncurrently reported in the reserve area (Rodrigues et al. 2008). This, allied with \n\nthe favourable combination of bathymetric features and ocean and wind \n\ncirculation (namely the Azorean anti-cyclone and the Portuguese continental \n\nshelf upwelling), characterizes the area as rich feeding and breeding grounds \n\nfor several seabird species (Paiva et al. 2010b; Werner 2010). Berlenga \n\nfeatures the only breeding populations of pelagic seabirds in continental \n\nPortugal: the Cory\u2019s Shearwater (Calonectris borealis), and the Madeira Storm-\n\nPetrel (Oceanodroma castro), the former only in Farilh\u00f5es. Presently, the \n\narchipelago hosts approximately 850 breeding pairs of Cory\u2019s Shearwaters, \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\ndistributed among Farilh\u00f5es Islets (500-550 pairs) and Berlenga Island (300 \n\npairs) (Lecoq et al. 2011). The European Shag (Phalacrorax aristotelis), Lesser \n\nBlack-backed Gull Larus fuscus, and until recently, the critically endangered \n\nCommon Murre Uria aalgae also attended breeders on the island.  The most \n\nabundant bird is the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) which possibly \n\nundertakes a negative effect on the other seabird populations as stated by \n\nLecoq et al. (2011) when they registered predation of Cory\u2019s shearwater eggs at \n\nFarilh\u00f5es islets. Other limiting factors for the presence of seabirds on Berlenga \n\nIsland are the introduced mammals: Black rats, Rattus rattus, and wild rabbits, \n\nOryctolagus cuniculus (Amado 2007). It is known that the presence of rats and \n\nother introduced mammals can lead to the decrease of population numbers or \n\neven to the extinction of other species including seabirds (Towns et al. 2006; \n\nJones et al. 2008). The archipelago is not only an important breeding ground \n\nbut its marine area is also important during spring (March) and autumn \n\n(September) migrations of the Northern gannet, Morus bassanus, which is \n\nregularly seen in flocks of several thousand individuals. There are also \n\nobservations of a Critically Endangered species, Balearic shearwater, Puffinus \n\nmauretanicus, in large flocks passing near Cape Carvoeiro (Ramirez et al. \n\n2008).  \n\nIn 2011, the Berlengas Natura 2000 site (SPA) was enlarged to include a \n\nsignificant proportion of its marine area. Linked to this site extension, the \n\nPortuguese nature conservation agency (ICNF) launched an initiative to \n\ndevelop a management plan for the new area. Unfortunately, the baseline \n\ninformation proved to be insufficient and clear planned actions were lacking. As \n\na result, the LIFE + Berlengas, launched on June 1\nst\n with a total duration of four \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nyears was created, coordinated by the Portuguese Society for the Study of \n\nBirds (SPEA), in partnership with the Conservation Institute for Nature and \n\nForest (ICNF), the Municipality of Peniche (CMP), the Faculty of Social \n\nSciences and Humanities (FCSH) of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and with \n\nan external observer the School of Tourism and Maritime Technology (ESTM), \n\nthe Polytechnic Institute of Leiria. \n\nLIFE Berlengas aims to monitor the fauna and flora of the archipelago, \n\ncontrol and eradicate invasive species of plants and mammals and implement a \n\nsustainable management strategy of natural values, contributing to the \n\nconservation of a vast area that includes the Natura 2000 network. \n\nManagement of seabirds also take place, as monitoring the breeding seabird \n\nspecies (Cory\u2019s shearwater, Madeira Storm petrel, Cormorant among others) as \n\nwell as augmenting the number of artificial nests for Cory\u2019s shearwater and \n\nstorm-petrel, individual tracking of species and metal ringing of these birds, are \n\nalso included in this project. (http://berlengas.eu/pt/enquadramento). \n\n \n\n2.1.2 The Atlantic Ocean \n\nWhen studying top marine predators such as the Cory\u2019s Shearwater, the \n\nstudy area is greatly enlarged since most of the tracking data from their \n\nmigratory processes extends the surrounding colony area to cover large \n\nportions of the Atlantic Ocean, as individuals are often present in coastal areas \n\nof the North and South America as well as the African coast. Oceanographic \n\ncharacteristics over such large areas are under influence of several \n\nenvironmental factors, showing remarkable variations in ecological aspects, \n\nsuch as sea surface temperature and marine productivity which, in turn, can \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nplay a significant role in species distribution and behaviour (Warham 1996; \n\nLouzao et al. 2006; Paiva et al. 2010c).  \n\nThe North Atlantic Basin is under influence of the North Atlantic Gyre, one \n\nof the five major oceanic gyres. It is a circular system of ocean currents that \n\nstretches across the North Atlantic from near the equator almost to Iceland, and \n\nfrom the east coast of North America to the west coasts of Europe and Africa. \n\nThe composing currents of the North Atlantic Gyre include the Gulf Stream in \n\nthe west, the Canary Current in the east, the North Atlantic Current in the north \n\nand finally the Atlantic North Equatorial Current in the south, forming a \n\nclockwise rotating subtropical gyre (Barton 2001). \n\nThis gyre is particularly important for the central role it plays in the \n\nthermohaline circulation, bringing salty water west from the Mediterranean Sea \n\nand then north to form the North Atlantic Deep Water, as well as nutrient-poor \n\nwarm water extracted from subtropical areas by the Gulf Stream, and nutrient-\n\nrich cold water injected into the system via the Arctic Labrador Current (Barton \n\n2001). This cycling profile is not the same throughout the year, with seasonal \n\nvariations occurring during summer. This effect is caused by the increase of the \n\nsea surface temperature (SST), and results in a significant shift of productivity \n\nvalues of areas close to the Portuguese coast towards areas located in the \n\nArctic Circle (Paiva et al. 2010b; Soares 2013). Consequences such effects on \n\nthe at-sea distribution and behaviour of Cory\u2019s Shearwater in the North Atlantic \n\ncan be found throughout the literature (e.g. Granadeiro et al. 1998; Paiva 2009; \n\nRoscales et al. 2011), although it\u2019s generally focused on the breeding period. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n2.2 Study Species \n\nThe Cory\u2019s Shearwater (Calonectris borealis) is a colonial, medium sized \n\nlong-distance migrant procellariform. Like most other Procellariiformes, they \n\nshow no sexual dimorphism in plumage characters, however, sexual \n\ndimorphism in bill size and shape, wing length, and overall body size is \n\nconsiderable. Nevertheless, accurately sexing a bird by analysing a single \n\nmorphometric variable has shown to be almost impossible (Granadeiro 1993, \n\nThibault et al. 1997, Navarro et al. 2009). Until very recently (2014), we could \n\nconsider two subspecies, Scopoli's shearwater and Cory's shearwater (the \n\nMediterranean Calonectris diomedea diomedea, and the Atlantic Calonectris \n\ndiomedea borealis respectively), that are now split into two distinct species \n\nfollowing Del Hoyo et al. 2014 (http://www.birdlife.org/). They are nocturnal on \n\ntheir breeding grounds, and in late afternoon birds can be observed waiting for \n\ndarkness at sea in front of their colonies, in flocks of hundreds or thousands of \n\nindividuals, before coming onshore (Warham 1990).  \n\nC. borealis migrates through long trans-equatorial migration routes to \n\nmove between non-breeding and breeding areas. During the non-breeding \n\nseason (December-February) they migrate to productive areas located in the \n\nSouth Atlantic which are associated with the Benguela, Agulhas, Brazil and \n\nCanary Currents (Gonz\u00e1lez-Solis et al. 2007; Ramos et al. 2012). During the \n\nbreeding season (March-October) Cory\u2019s shearwater migrate and breed in the \n\nNorth Atlantic archipelagos such as Berlengas, Azores, Madeira and Canary \n\narchipelagos (Navarro et al. 2007; Paiva et al. 2010b). \n\nTheir reproductive behaviour is characterized by a great energetic \n\ninvestment from both parents, spread throughout the 8 months of the breeding \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\ncycle, with a long egg incubation period (54 days) and a very long chick rearing \n\nperiod (90 days). During this period, the parents take alternate foraging trips to \n\nprovide food for the young and restock their own nutritional necessities, often \n\ntravelling tens to hundreds of kilometres from the breeding site on a single \n\njourney (Magalh\u00e3es 2008). Their food regime consists mainly on epi - and - \n\nmesopelagic fish and also on squid (Granadeiro et al. 1998; Xavier et al. 2011). \n\nAt the start of the breeding season \u2013 pre-laying period - Cory\u2019s \n\nshearwaters begin to attend their nesting colony around one month prior to \n\nlaying. These birds present high levels of philopatry, and thus tend to maintain \n\nthe same nest of previous years, and couples are also usually faithful for life. \n\nMales will arrive first and attend the colony more frequently than females, partly \n\nin order to protect the selected nest against other conspecifics and copulate.  \n\nThereafter they leave the nesting area to feed, replacing the energy lost during \n\nmigration from the non-breeding areas and stocking up on nutritional reserves \n\nthat will sustain them through the early stages of the reproductive process \n\n(Werner 2010, Paiva et al. 2013a). \n\nFemales embark on an approximate twenty day journey (Jouanin et al. \n\n2001) a pre-laying exodus after copulation, key to build up body reserves to \n\nform and lay their egg. This departure starts in early May and after their return \n\nto the colony, in late May, females lay the egg which will be incubated in shifts \n\nby the breeding pair during almost two months (Paiva et al. 2010b). This dual \n\neffort of biparental care also extends to the high energy demand period of chick-\n\nrearing, after the eggs are hatched (starting at the end of July). To respond to \n\nthese high energetic needs, the foraging strategy employed by the species is \n\nbased on a cycle between short (1-2 days) and long trips (3-9 days), with short \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\ntrips used to provide for the chick, while long trips are performed to replenish \n\nthe adult\u2019s nutritional reserves. (Magalh\u00e3es et al. 2008; Navarro and Gonz\u00e1lez-\n\nSol\u00eds 2009; Paiva et al. 2010a; 2010b; 2010c). This strategy allows birds to \n\nbalance the constraint of regularly visiting the colony on the one hand, and \n\naccessing better fishing areas farther from the colony on the other. \n\nAs the chick rearing process progresses, both the frequency of food input \n\nand degree of digestion by the parents decrease (Ramos et al. 2003). By the \n\nend of September, the chick will stop growing and a reduction in the overall \n\nbody size will be compensated by wing growth. This process lasts until late \n\nOctober and early November when chicks finally fledge to start exploring the \n\nocean at night (Warham 1990).  During winter, the species travels thousands of \n\nkilometres to feed in warmer climates, being found mainly in South Africa, \n\nBrazil, and southern central Atlantic (Camphuysen &amp; Van Der Meer 2001; \n\nRamos et al. 2009b) \n\n \n\n2.3  Fieldwork \n\nThe tracking study was conducted on Berlenga Island located in the \n\nPortuguese coast (39\u00b0 23\u2019 N, 9\u00b0 36\u2019 W), during September (chick-rearing period \n\ndata) of 2010 \u2013 2014. GPS tracking devices CatTraq Travel Loggers (Fig. 1) \n\n(Perthold Engineering LLC) were employed as GPS-loggers, as these gadgets \n\nseem to provide the most accurate data, with an error of meters (Ramirez et al. \n\n2008). This specific device (44.5 * 28.5 * 13mm) weighs 15g and contains a \n\nSiRF StarIII chipset, a patch antenna and an 180mAh Lithium-ion battery. \n\nDevices were stripped of their original plastic case and sealed with a thermo-\n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nFigure 1 - GPS tracking devices, CatTraq Travel \nLoggers employed as GPS-loggers. \n\nretractile rubber sleeve for waterproofing. Loggers weight represented between \n\n1.9% and 2.7% (median = 2.5%) of the birds weight. \n\nDevices were set to record data each 5 minutes, with loggers\u2019 batteries \n\ndraining out in about 15 days. The study colony is situated on the eastern side \n\nof the \u201cOld Island\u201d of Berlenga where approximately 130 pairs of Cory\u2019s \n\nshearwater nest in rock crevices, burrows and (mostly) artificial nests.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBirds were captured during the night at their nest sites, weighed and \n\nindividually identified by their ring numbers. GPS loggers were then attached \n\nusing TESA\u00ae tape (Wilson et al. 1997) to the contour feathers along and in \n\nbetween both scapula\u2019s (Fig. 2). As an extra security measure we glued the tips \n\nof each tape stripe used to attach the logger. The birds were then returned to \n\ntheir nests, this process took less than 10 minutes in order to minimize the \n\noverall stress. At logger retrieval, a blood sample (Fig. 2) of about 0.5 ml was \n\ncollected from the tarsal vein of each individual, for evaluation of its trophic \n\nchoices during the tracking period, through stable isotope analysis (SIA; trophic \n\necology). \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nThe 55 tracked birds (N = 27 female and N = 28 male Cory\u2019s shearwaters) \n\nwere divided into experienced and inexperienced individuals using the total \n\nnumber of breeding attempts as a proxy for experience, following indications of \n\nprevious studies (Jones &amp; Ryan 2014; Froy et al. 2015; Haug et al. 2015) and \n\nthe prediction that reproductive success typically increases with breeding age \n\nand experience in seabirds (e.g. Forslund and P\u00e4rt 1995). Our study benefited \n\nfrom a long-term database of the breeding population, such that minimum age, \n\nsex and previous breeding experience (i.e. fledging success) were known for \n\nmost of the individuals (Lecoq et al. 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThus, birds included in this study were categorized as inexperienced (? 2 \n\nyears of breeding successfully; N = 26) and experienced (> 2 successful years; \n\nN = 29) individuals, based on the frequency distribution of the historical \n\nbreeding success records. The breeding scores extended back to 2005 for our \n\nstudy site, and we considered the 7-year breeding success of the individuals, \n\nprior to our study (2005\u20132010). The former assumption is supported by a \n\nFigure 2 - Fieldwork procedures at the breeding colony (A) Process of logger \n\ndeployment; (B) Collection of blood samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\npositive significant correlation (Spearman rs = 0.77, N = 55, P &lt;0.001) between \n\nestimated age of individuals and chicks that fledged by each individual per \n\nbreeding attempt since 2005. \n\nEach year, the tracked birds were measured (body weight and wing \n\nlength) in order to calculate their body condition index (BCI). This index was \n\nobtained from the residuals of the linear regression of body weight on wing \n\nlength, a measure of structural size (Brown 1996). BCI is therefore a measure \n\nof mass corrected for size and is considered an indicator of energetic reserves. \n\n \n\n2.4  Area of Restricted Search (ARS) zones \n\nFauchald &amp; Tveraa (2003) developed a technique, named First Passage \n\nTime (FPT) to assess the spatial scale that animals use to encounter their prey. \n\nFPT is, by definition, the time required for an animal to pass through a circle \n\nwith a given radius r. By moving this circle along the path of the animal, we will \n\nobtain a scale-dependent measure of search effort and therefore the \n\nbehavioural response of an individual in the environment. Because top marine \n\npredators usually forage in a patchy and hierarchical environment (Fauchald \n\n1999), increases in the turning rate and/or decreases in speed of its foraging \n\npath should be related to the so-called Area Restricted Search (ARS) \n\nbehaviour. ARS will then appear as an individual reaction to changes in the \n\nresources availability and distribution, by increasing the residence time in the \n\nproductive patch (Fauchald &amp; Tveraa 2003). \n\nZones of Area Restricted Search (ARS) were estimated applying First \n\nPassage Time (FPT) analysis, following (Fauchald &amp; Tveraa 2003) and using \n\nsoftware R 3.0 (R Development Core Team 2014). Usually, \u2018in water\u2019 positions \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nresult in very small-scale ARS zones (<100 m diameter), which considerably \n\nincrease the variance in FPT and can camouflage larger-scale ARS zone \n\n(Weimerskirch et al. 2007). To address this problem, we removed bouts on the \n\nwater and interpolated locations to obtain a distance interval of 0.1 km for FPT \n\nanalysis (Pinaud 2008). We considered positions with speed &lt;3 km h\n-1\n\n as \n\nresting or preening behaviours on the water or inland, after inspection of the \n\nfrequency distribution of speeds. Following the recommendations of (Pinaud \n\n2008), FPT analysis was performed in two steps: 1) to detect large-scale ARS \n\nwe run the analysis on the whole path, estimating the FPT every 1 km for a \n\nradius r from 1 to 50 km; 2) to detect small spatial scale events we run again \n\nFPT analysis every 0.1 km for an r varying between 0.1 and 10 km. The plot \n\nrepresenting variance in log (FPT) as a function of r allowed us to identify the \n\nARS scales by peaks in the variance. In this calculation, FPT was log \n\ntransformed to make the variance independent of the magnitude of the mean \n\nFPT (Fauchald &amp; Tveraa 2003). It is also possible to locate where the bird \n\nentered an ARS zone and the time spent on that area by plotting FPT values \n\nwhere a peak of variance occurred as a function of time since departure from \n\nthe colony. ARS locations were also used to feed the General Linear Additive \n\nModels (GAMMs). \n\n \n\n2.5  Habitat use \n\nGPS locations of each bird where ARS behaviour was detected (ARS \n\nzones) were examined under the adehabitatHR R package (Calenge 2006) \n\ngenerating Kernel Utilization Distribution (Kernel UD) estimates. The most \n\nappropriate smoothing parameter (h) was chosen via least squares cross-\n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nvalidation for the unsmoothed GPS data, and then applied as standard for the \n\nother datasets and grid size was set at 0.05\u00ba (to match the grid of environmental \n\npredictors). We considered the 50% and 95% kernel UD contours to represent \n\nthe core foraging areas (FR) and the home range (HR), respectively. \n\nThe extent of within-year overlap between male and female home ranges \n\nwas estimated using Bhattacharyya\u2019s affinity (BA; Bhattacharyya 1943), which \n\nranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (complete overlap). Using BA as a measure of \n\nspatial overlap, we used a randomization technique to test the null hypothesis \n\nthat there was no difference in the spatial distribution of males and females in \n\neach year of the study. If the null hypothesis was true, the magnitude of the \n\noverlap between males and female 50% and 95% kernels should not differ \n\nsignificantly from that calculated if sex were randomly assigned. Therefore, for \n\neach year the sex of each bird was randomly assigned using the same sex ratio \n\nas the observations in that year. In total, we generated a null distribution for BA \n\nbased on 1000 randomizations of our dataset in order to test whether the \n\noverlap between male and female home-ranges was significantly different than \n\nexpected. P-values were determined by the proportion of random overlaps that \n\nwere smaller than the observed overlap, if the observed overlap was smaller \n\nthan all 1000 randomly generated overlaps, then p was ? 0.005 (see Breed et \n\nal. 2006 for a similar approach). More details on BA and other measures of \n\nspatial overlap can be found in Fieberg &amp; Kochanny (2005). \n\n \n\n2.6  Environmental data \n\nThe extended winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index was used as a \n\nlarge-scale environmental predictor for the North Atlantic area, and specifically \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nfor the Western Iberia Upwelling Ecosystem (WIUE). The NAO index refers to a \n\nnorth\u2013south alternation in atmospheric mass between the subtropical Atlantic \n\nand the Arctic, and thus involves out-of-phase behaviour between the \n\nclimatological low-pressure centre near Iceland and the high-pressure centre \n\nnear the Azores (https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/hurrell-north-\n\natlantic-oscillation-nao-index-station-based). We also used some small-scale \n\nenvironmental predictors, such as chlorophyll a concentration (CHL) and SST \n\ndata, downloaded from http://oceanocolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/, as daily night-time \n\nproducts with a resolution of 0.04\u00b0 (approx. 4 km) in the SMI-HDF format. \n\nBathymetric data (BAT), taken as water depth, was downloaded from the \n\nETOPO2v2 database at a spatial resolution of 0.03\u00b0 (approximately 3 km; \n\nhttp://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/fliers/01mgg04.html). HDF files were converted \n\nto raster using the Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools in ArcGIS 9.2 (Roberts et \n\nal. 2010), and then to ASCII to create composites. All composites were \n\nconstructed using the freeware R environment (version 2.14, R Core Team \n\n2014) and mosaic function of the raster package. Spatial gradients of SST, CHL \n\nand BAT (SSTG, CHLG and BATG, respectively) were obtained by estimating \n\nthe proportional change (PC) within a surrounding 3 \u00d7 3 cell grid using a moving \n\nwindow as follows: PC = [(maximum value ? minimum value) \u00d7 100/maximum \n\nvalue] (Louzao et al. 2006). SSTG and CHLG are believed to be good indicators \n\nof oceanic fronts, while the BATG was used as a proxy for slope. Additionally, \n\ntwo more static variables were generated. Distance to land (DLAN) was \n\ncalculated using the distance tool in the ArcGIS 10.1 spatial analyst toolbox. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n2.7  Stable isotope analysis (SIA) \n\nStable-nitrogen isotope ratios (\n15\n\nN: \n14\n\nN, expressed as ?\n15\n\nN) and stable-\n\ncarbon isotope ratios (\n13\n\nC: \n12\n\nC, expressed as ?\n13\n\nC) on plasma and red blood \n\ncells of Cory\u2019s shearwater were assessed to investigate the effect of experience \n\non their foraging ecology and prey selection. The ratios represent the prey \n\ningested in the past few weeks before the blood sample. The ?\n15\n\nN is mainly \n\nused to define the trophic position of the consumer, while ?\n13\n\nC reflects the \n\nforaging habitat of the consumer (Inger &amp; Bearhop 2008, Ceia et al. 2012). It is \n\nassumed that potential intraspecific differences in assimilation efficiency or \n\nphysiology, does not impact the blood isotope values significantly (Votier et al. \n\n2011). There is a gradient of high to low values of ?\n13\n\nC from coast to offshore \n\ndue to the organic enrichment at the coast that is gradually diluted. Red blood \n\ncells (RBC) are regenerated every 12-22 days while plasma has a turnover rate \n\nof about 7 days, therefore they represent prey ingestion in different time scopes: \n\nRBC reflects the trophic ecology the last few weeks, and plasma reflects \n\nchoices made in the last trips before sampling (i.e. around 7 days; Inger &amp; \n\nBearhop 2008). \n\nEach of the tracked birds was sampled upon return from a foraging trip. \n\nBlood samples (1 ml) were collected from the tarsal or brachial vein using 25-\n\ngauge needles under license. Blood samples were then separated into plasma \n\nand red blood cells (hereafter termed RBC) by a centrifugation at 12000 rpm for \n\n15 min, within 2-4 hours of sampling and stored frozen at \u201320 \u00b0C until \n\npreparation for analysis. Successive rinses with a 2:1 chloroform/methanol \n\nsolution were performed on the plasma samples in order to deplete it for lipids, \n\nwhich may disturb the results (Cherel et al. 2005b). Plasma samples were dried \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nin an aspirating hood for 48h at 60\u00b0C for the ethanol to evaporate. Isotope ratios \n\nof carbon and nitrogen were then determined through standard methodology \n\n(Bearhop et al. 2006, Phillips et al. 2009) by continuous-flow isotope ratio mass \n\nspectrometry, using an EA-IRMS (Isoprime, Micromass, UK). The analytical \n\nprecision for the measurement was 0.2\u2030 for both carbon and nitrogen. All \n\nvalues presented are means \u00b1 1 SD unless otherwise stated. \n\n \n\n2.8 Statistical analysis  \n\nGeneralized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) tested the effect of (1) year \n\n(2010 \u2013 2014), (2) sex and, (3) the interaction between 1 and 2 (i.e. \n\nindependent variables) on the (1) regional and (2) local environmental \n\npredictors, (3) foraging trip characteristics, (4) habitat of foraging areas, (5) \n\ntrophic ecology and (6) fitness parameters (i.e. dependent variables). Trip \n\nidentity was nested within the individual as a random term to avoid potential \n\npseudo-replication problems, since all individual birds performed multiple trips. \n\nGaussian distribution of error terms and a log-link function were used in the \n\nmodelling. Post-hoc multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction were used \n\nto identify significant differences between categories of each independent \n\nvariable. R packages used in the GLMMs were lme4 (Bates et al. 2014) and \n\nlmerTest (Kuznetsova et al. 2014).  \n\nWhen modelling the occurrence of ARS behaviour (First Passage Time \u2013 \n\nFPT \u2013 duration) in male and female Cory\u2019s shearwaters we used GAMMs to (1) \n\nselect the most parsimonious models explaining FPT and (2) estimate \n\nsmoothers for each of the environmental parameters for the top-ranked models \n\n(?AICc &lt;2). GAMMs combine the utilities of linear mixed models (Pinheiro &amp; \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nBates 2000) and generalized additive models (Hastie &amp; Tibshirani 1990) so that \n\nrandom factors, fixed factors and nonlinear predictor variables can all be \n\nestimated in the same statistical model. We developed separate models for \n\nmale and female birds and included (1) year, (2) breeding experience and (3) all \n\ndifferent environmental predictors of productivity (e.g. SST) as fixed factors, trip \n\nidentity within bird identity as a random term (to account for pseudoreplication \n\nissues). \n\nAs part of the gam functions within the R package mgcv (Wood 2002) the \n\nsmoothing parameter is chosen automatically using generalised cross-validation \n\n(GCV). In order to model spatial auto-correlation we included an isotropic thin \n\nplate spline which is set up as a two-dimensional smoother based on both x and \n\ny coordinates (in R this would be specified as s(x,y)). Incorporating a spatial \n\nsmoother is one means of modelling a spatial trend within a model, more details \n\non this approach can be found in Wood (2002). Prior to modelling we examined \n\ncorrelations between all environmental variables in order to ascertain whether \n\ncollinearity may have occurred. We assumed that a correlation of greater than \n\nSpearman correlation: rs = 0.5 was problematic, and thus the environmental \n\npredictor (from the pair of highly correlated ones) which produced the highest \n\nAkaike Information Criteria (AIC) value on a univariate analysis was excluded. \n\nInitially we restricted GAMMs to a maximum of 5 knots to prevent over-fitting, \n\nhowever if GAMMs failed diagnostic checks we increased the number of knots \n\nuntil these checks were satisfactory. For the spatial smoothers in the models we \n\nused the default settings in the mgcv package (Wood 2002) to estimate the \n\nnumber of knots required. When performing GAMMs, minimum adequate \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nmodels were selected by backwards selection, using K-fold cross-validation, \n\nwhere K = 5, following Hastie &amp; Tibshirani (1990). \n\nTo establish the isotopic niche among periods with the stable isotope data \n\nwe applied the recent metric SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R), \n\nwhich is based in a Bayesian framework that confers a robust comparison to be \n\nmade among data sets concerning different sample sizes (Jackson et al. 2011). \n\nThe area of the standard ellipse (SEAc, an ellipse that has 40% probability of \n\ncontaining a subsequently sampled datum) was adopted to compare between \n\ninexperienced and experienced bird isotopic signatures and their overlap in \n\nrelation to the total niche width (both groups combined), and a Bayesian \n\nestimate of the standard ellipse and its area (SEAB) to test whether group 1 is \n\nsmaller than group 2 (i.e. p, the proportion of ellipses in inexperienced birds that \n\nwere lower than in experienced individuals; see Jackson et al. 2011 for more \n\ndetails). All the metrics were calculated using standard.ellipse and convexhull \n\nfunctions from SIBER implemented in the package SIAR (Stable Isotope \n\nAnalysis in R; Parnell et al. 2010) under R 2.15.2 (Core Team 2014). All data \n\nare presented as mean \u00b1 1 SD, unless otherwise stated. Results were \n\nconsidered significant at p ? 0.05.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3 - Results \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\n \n\n3 Results \n\nDuring 2010, 2011 and 2013 the NAO index (Jun - Aug) was on average \n\n5.7 values significantly lower and the SST within 200km off Berlenga was 2.8 \u00baC \n\nsignificantly higher when compared to 2012 and 2014. During the same 3 years, \n\nbirds travelled ~ 187.3 km significantly further from their colony and spent more \n\n14.1 % of time in foraging areas when compared to 2012 and 2014. Moreover, \n\nfemales travelled ~101.8 km significantly further from their colony and spent \n\nmore 18.5 % of time in foraging areas when compared to male Cory\u2019s \n\nshearwaters (Table I and II, Fig. 3). SST and ASST were on average 3.2 and \n\n4.1 \u00baC significantly higher, respectively, in 2010, 2011 and 2013 than in 2012 \n\nand 2014, while CHLA was 1.1 mgm\n-3\n\n lower on 2010 when compared to the \n\nother four years. The plasma carbon and nitrogen signatures were 2.1 and 1.5 \n\n\u2030 significantly lower and higher, respectively, in the years 2010, 2011, 2014 \n\nthan in 2012 and 2013. Females showed a plasma nitrogen signature 2.1 \u2030 \n\nlower and a plasma SEAb 1.2 units higher than males. The adult\u2019s BCI was 0.6 \n\nsignificantly lower in 2010, 2011, 2013 than in 2012, and 2014, while females \n\nhad a 0.7 lower BCI than males. \n\nDuring 2010, 2011 and 2013 there was a significantly smaller proportion of \n\noverlaps between sexes for both the 50% and the 95% Kernel UD. During 2012 \n\nand 2014, the percentage of overlap between sexes was high (>42.8%) and \n\nnon-significantly different (Table III). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3\n9\n\n \n \n\nT\na\n\nb\nle\n\n I\n.

The FPT duration in females increased with increasing BAT \n\nand BATG and with decreasing distance to land and SST (Fig. 4). Moreover, FPT duration \n\nwas typically higher in experienced females and with lower SSTA, than in inexperienced \n\nfemales with higher SSTA. The FPT duration was also higher in recent years and in \n\nexperienced females, than in earlier study years and inexperienced females. FPT duration \n\nincreased in males, with decreasing BAT and BATG, SST and DLAN, while it increased \n\nwith increasing CHLG.

(2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n46 \n\n4.1 General discussion \n\n \n\n Several studies report partial or complete inter-sexual spatial foraging \n\nsegregation in seabird species, such as in black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche \n\nmelanophris (Huin 2002), cape gannets Morus capensis (Gr\u00e9millet et al. 2004), \n\nHawaiian petrels Pterodroma sandwichensis (Wiley et al. 2012) or streaked \n\nshearwaters Calonectris leucomelas (Yamamoto et al. 2011). While seeking if inter-\n\nsexual segregation occurred in our study species, our results reveal that individual \n\nexperience as well as sex differences can play a significant role in Cory\u2019s \n\nShearwater\u2019s ecology and at-sea behaviour during the chick-provisioning season, \n\nspecially taking into account the changing levels of productivity that occurred in the \n\nsurroundings of the birds\u2019 colony throughout the time frame of our study (2010-\n\n2014). As described by former studies (e.g. Paiva et al. 2013a, 2013b; Haug et al. \n\n2015) our results also link the negative NAO index values (Hurrel et al. 1995) and \n\nthe subsequent decrease in productivity (proxied by a decrease in CHLA and \n\nincrease in SST) in the Northeast Atlantic with alterations in the foraging behaviour \n\nof Cory\u2019s Shearwaters breeding in the continental shelf of Portugal.  \n\nIn fact, there are a number of studies in relating sexual differences with \n\nforaging ecology, often with contradictory results. Overall, seabirds with pronounced \n\nsexual size dimorphism are often more associated with sexual differences in foraging \n\nbehaviour and ecology (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. 2000, Phillips et al. 2004). Sex-specific \n\ndifferences in foraging behaviour are usually credited to the influence of body size on \n\nforaging efficiency and intra-specific competition but there are also studies showing \n\nno sexual differences in foraging ecology and behaviour (Navarro et al. 2009, Ramos \n\net al. 2009). The study presented here shows the importance of examining a large \n\nrange of environmental conditions, indispensable to detect sexual differences in \n\n\n\nJustin da Silva Pereira (2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n47 \n\nforaging ecology and behaviour, even if such differences are relatively small. \n\nHowever, even small differences may be ecologically relevant because both sexes \n\nwill face strong competition when environmental conditions are poor. \n\nAccording to our first prediction, our study suggests that inter-sexual \n\ndifferences in the foraging behaviour and distribution of Cory\u2019s shearwaters do exist. \n\nThese differences are evident in years of greater stochasticity (specially during 2010, \n\n2011 and 2013, when NAO index values were very low), when females travelled \n\nsignificantly further from their colony and spent more time in foraging areas when \n\ncompared to male Cory\u2019s shearwaters (Table I and II, Fig. 3). Contrastingly during \n\nthe breeding seasons of 2012 and 2014, no significant differences in foraging areas \n\nwere observed, leading us to believe that productivity plays an important role in inter-\n\nsexual differences in the foraging behaviour of these birds.  \n\nOn the other hand, and according to our second prediction, life history trait \n\nfactors such as environmental stochasticity, affected both sexes in different ways. \n\nFemales exploited more pelagic waters during poor oceanographic productivity while \n\nmales remained closer to areas surrounding the colony. Interestingly, experience \n\nalso seems to play an important role on the birds foraging behaviour, as our result \n\nshow that inexperienced males exhibit higher values on foraging effort parameters \n\n(e.g. maximum distance to colony) when compared to more experienced ones. \n\nInexperienced individuals presented a higher pelagic behaviour than experienced \n\nones, with feeding strategy based on prey located on lower trophic levels. \n\nExperienced individuals\u2019 distribution was greatly concentrated around coastal areas, \n\nwith few foraging areas and diet based on higher trophic level prey. These results \n\ncould be explained by the fact that young Cory\u2019s shearwaters (non-breeders) spend \n\nmost of the time at sea, as do many other species of seabirds (Warham 1996). Thus, \n\n\n\nJustin da Silva Pereira (2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n48 \n\nthe opportunity is presented to learn and gather information on the conditions and \n\nforaging opportunities of different sites, allowing them to forage on different location \n\nof more experienced individuals when productivity is low. By analysing foraging \n\ndistributions of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), P\u00e9ron (2012) emphasised \n\nthe impact of increases on sea surface temperatures. In her study, increases in \n\ntemperature acted as one of the main drivers of foraging distribution on the species, \n\ninducing birds to search for resources in higher latitudes. It is not unreasonable to \n\nextrapolate that a similar scenario occurred in Cory\u2019s shearwater, since sea surface \n\ntemperature (SST) was considered one of the most influential environmental \n\npredictors affecting the spatial distribution of both male/female and \n\nexperienced/inexperienced individuals. \n\nFinally, results from the stable isotope analysis depicted significant differences \n\non the foraging ecology of female and male individuals. Results from the Carbon \n\nisotope analysis indicates that males foraged closer to land during chick provisioning \n\nseasons, while females tended to forage in more pelagic areas. These results \n\nsupport the conclusions made based on tracking and activity patterns, and fall into \n\naccord with data from isotopic analyses reported for the breeding season by Haug \n\n(2015) and Missagia (2015). \n\n \n\n4.2  Environmental factors driving inter-sexual foraging segregation  \n\nOur study has considered the NAO as a surrogate of marine productivity. \n\nStudies by Osborn 2011; Paiva et al. 2013a, have unveiled details about the \n\nrelationship between large scale atmospheric phenomena, driven by the NAO, and \n\nits effects on different levels of the food web. Negative values for 2010, 2011 and \n\n2013 have coincided with significant increases in SST and reductions in CHLA, \n\n\n\nJustin da Silva Pereira (2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n49 \n\ncontrasting to what happens in 2012 and 2014, when positive NAO where observed. \n\nDespite the fact that the at-sea patterns were generally similar between sexes, \n\nsexual segregation was observed in years of greater environmental stochasticity, \n\nwhen marine productivity was the lowest. Birds travelled greater distances from their \n\ncolony as well as spent more time in foraging areas when compared to years of \n\nhigher productivity. Therefore, previous studies finding no evidence of sexual \n\nsegregation in foraging behaviour and foraging strategies of Cory\u2019s shearwater \n\n(Ramos et al. 2009, Navarro et al. 2009) are partly explained by the fact that they \n\nwere conducted solely during the incubation period, and presumably during years of \n\nrelatively good environmental conditions. In fact, Ramos et al. (2009) suggested that \n\nsubtler differences between the two sexes might exist, for instance in diving \n\nbehaviour, or be detected in resource partitioning such as differences in the size of \n\nprey consumed between both sexes. While we did not examine such factors in this \n\nstudy, we were able to show significant differences between males and females in \n\nforaging distribution and oceanographic features within the birds\u2019 foraging areas, as \n\nwell as in several aspects of trophic ecology. Foraging trip characteristics, habitat of \n\nforaging areas, trophic ecology (measured by stable isotope signatures) and body \n\ncondition of females during years of poor environmental conditions were significantly \n\naffected, and thus differed from those of males (also from females during good \n\nyears). Therefore, our study suggests that sexual differences in foraging ecology for \n\nthe Cory\u2019s shearwater are likely to be relevant during poor environmental conditions. \n\nOur results make sense in the light of the competitive exclusion by the dominant sex, \n\ni.e. males over females (Phillips et al. 2004), which will occur mostly when \n\nenvironmental conditions are poor and resources are scarce.  Furthermore, previous \n\nstudies regarding such effects were conducted merely during a single breeding \n\n\n\nJustin da Silva Pereira (2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n50 \n\nseason, and thus failed to detect such important influence of environmental \n\nconditions on sexual foraging segregation. \n\nSex-specific niche divergence and habitat segregation can arise from a \n\ndifference between sexes in parental roles (Thaxter et al. 2009) but the roles of male \n\nand female Cory\u2019s Shearwater do not appear to differ during chick-rearing (Navarro \n\net al. 2009). However, males and females could forage in different areas in order to \n\nensure that their chicks receive the optimum blend of prey species. Sex-specific \n\ndifferences were observed by analysing the first passage time (FPT; a proxy of \n\nforaging effort), where experienced females appear to spend less time searching for \n\nprey comparatively with inexperienced female. The foraging ecology of a marine \n\npredator is highly dependent on the abundance and distribution of prey (Bell 1991), \n\nand their dispersion is associated to large-scale ocean productivity (Hyrenbach et al. \n\n2002). Thus the differences presented in foraging behaviour may be given by the \n\ncontrasting productivity in the proximity of the island of Berlenga. The comparison of \n\nthe two NAO values (2010; -4.64 and 2011; -1.6) suggests a large difference in \n\noceanographic conditions (Osborn 2011), and therefore, may be a threshold in the \n\nsurroundings of BER when the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems is \n\nseverely affected (Walther et al. 2002) to force birds to leave their habitually \n\nproductive grounds in search of higher prey availability.  \n\n  \n\n4.3 Differential effects of the foraging choices on the trophic ecology of \n\nboth sexes \n\nOverall, the carbon isotopic signatures suggest that males seem to feed on \n\nprey inhabiting coastal environments (i.e. higher carbon signature) when compared \n\nto females, which exhibited a more exploratory and pelagic-oriented foraging pattern \n\n\n\nJustin da Silva Pereira (2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n51 \n\n(Quillfeldt et al. 2005). The option to forage over more pelagic environments, where \n\nprey availability is naturally more unpredictable (Weimerskirch 2007), might have \n\nimpacted the body condition of females during our study period. Females seem to \n\nhave been preying on low trophic level prey when compared to males, because they \n\npresented a lower nitrogen signature mostly during 2010, 2011 and 2013. There \n\nmight be at least two reasons for this, 1) females were more explorative in 2010, \n\n2011 and 2013 (i.e. years of poor environmental conditions, thus probably with lower \n\nfood availability) preying on low trophic level prey, such as cephalopod or less \n\nnitrogen rich small pelagic fish species (e.g. Scomber sp; Paiva et al. 2010c), or 2) in \n\nyears of food scarcity birds tend to attend more to fishery discards (Bicknell et al. \n\n2013) and when doing so, males might gain access to higher trophic level prey in \n\ncompetition with females (Navarro et al. 2010). Although both hypotheses can be \n\ntrue, only the collection of more tracking and blood data along with vessel monitoring \n\nsystem data during subsequent years will disentangle the major driver of this pattern \n\nbetween females and males. Nevertheless, both groups were isotopically segregated \n\neven in years where both sexes were foraging on similar regions (i.e. a higher \n\nforaging area overlap in 2012 and 2014 than on the other study years), which \n\ncertainly results from individuals feeding on isotopically different prey (Votier et al. \n\n2011) \n\n \n\n4.4 Conservation considerations  \n\nMuch has been discussed concerning the impact of climate change on the \n\ndistribution of seabirds. The general agreement points towards the prejudicial effects \n\nand fluctuations of highly influential environmental predictors, like sea surface \n\ntemperature, dissolved oxygen and productivity rates (Schreiber and Burger, 2001, \n\n\n\nJustin da Silva Pereira (2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n52 \n\nIrons et al., 2008). In fact, in years of food scarcity birds tend to attend more to \n\nfishery discards (Bicknell et al. 2013) which arises great concerns, given the danger \n\nthat these behaviours represent to the birds (i.e. mortality through bycatch events; \n\nBarcelona et al. 2010). It is expected that changes in the environment should cause \n\nan increase on the global spatial distribution of Cory\u2019s Shearwaters, with \n\nexperienced and inexperienced birds foraging in areas that until now have been \n\nignored. Temperature increase can act as one of the main drivers of foraging \n\ndistribution on the species, maybe inducing birds to search for resources in \n\nincreasingly offshore areas and higher latitudes. Although previous studies have \n\nshown that Cory\u2019s Shearwater present a remarkable foraging plasticity, and may be \n\namong the species of seabirds better adapted to endure climatic variations (Dias et \n\nal. 2010; Paiva et al. 2010a), some concerns arise with these shifts in environment \n\nconditions. For instance, we can also speculate that experienced birds would be \n\nmore affected by shifts in distribution than inexperienced ones, since these birds \n\nalready engage in migratory events that takes them to more pelagic areas (Missagia \n\net al. 2015). \n\n \n\n4.5  Conclusion \n\nThis study documented a clear spatial segregation of female versus male \n\nCory\u2019s Shearwaters as well as inexperienced versus experienced breeders, which \n\nincreased during the last couple of years. Males relied heavily on static variables like \n\nthe bathymetry of the area, while females were much more explorative, having a \n\ndifferent combination and weighting of important variables (i.e. productivity proxies). \n\nFemales undertook much larger foraging journeys than males, in years of greater \n\nstochasticity, similar to those during the pre-laying period. This study also adds to \n\n\n\nJustin da Silva Pereira (2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n53 \n\nprevious studies (e.g. Ramos et al. 2009; Navarro et al. 2009), proving that by \n\nanalysing multiple year breeding seasons, sexual segregation in foraging behaviour \n\nand foraging strategies in Cory\u2019s Shearwater can be observed and thus, subtler \n\ndifferences between both sexes may be especially important in years of poor \n\nenvironmental conditions. \n\nOur results also allow us to conclude that experience plays an important role \n\ndetermining the occurrence of spatial segregation in the species, showing it as a trait \n\nthat should not be considered by itself, but added to a much bigger group of \n\ninfluencing factors. Climate stochasticity might have a significant influence on the \n\nspatial distribution of the species, exercising greater influence on male and \n\nexperienced individuals (i.e. the group showing a more static distribution). \n\nNevertheless, the true effects of such large-scale events cannot be encompassed on \n\nsuch a short-term study, making the continuity of monitoring the foraging ecology of \n\nthis species crucial to understand the impact of climate change on this and other \n\nmarine taxa. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJustin da Silva Pereira (2015) Environmental driven sexual segregation in a marine predator \n \n\n55 \n\nAarts G., MacKenzie M., McConnell B., Fedak M., Matthiopoulos J.
