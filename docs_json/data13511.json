Apesar dos crescentes esfor\u00e7os e aumento dos estudos, muito pouco ainda \n\nse conhece sobre a biologia b\u00e1sica das esp\u00e9cies de anuros brasileiros. A biologia reprodutiva \n\nde Bokermannohyla ibitiguara, um hil\u00eddeo end\u00eamico do Cerrado brasileiro, provavelmente a \n\nsavana mais amea\u00e7ada do mundo, foi estudada em 17 expedi\u00e7\u00f5es a campo, entre agosto/2010 \n\ne julho/2011. A esp\u00e9cie apresenta reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o prolongada de outubro a junho. Os machos \n\nvocalizaram sobre diversos tipos de substratos em matas de galeria ao longo de riachos. O \n\ninvestimento reprodutivo (massa das g\u00f4nadas/massa do corpo) de machos foi 0,29% e o de \n\nf\u00eameas 20,26%. F\u00eameas gr\u00e1vidas apresentaram uma m\u00e9dia de 202 ov\u00f3citos com di\u00e2metro \n\nm\u00e9dio de 1,96 mm e o modo reprodutivo da esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 semelhante ao modo 4: ovos e est\u00e1gios \n\nlarvais iniciais em bacias naturais ou constru\u00eddas em riachos. Foi descrito o comportamento \n\nde corte complexo da esp\u00e9cie, com est\u00edmulos ac\u00fasticos e t\u00e1teis, al\u00e9m de briga entre dois \n\nmachos e canto de briga. Machos sat\u00e9lites foram observados e a m\u00e9dia de tamanho corporal \n\nn\u00e3o diferiu da de machos vocalizadores. A vocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 mista, composta de notas \n\ncurtas e longas, sugerindo diferentes fun\u00e7\u00f5es. Houve correla\u00e7\u00e3o negativa entre frequ\u00eancia \n\ndominante do canto e tamanho do corpo do macho e positiva entre dura\u00e7\u00e3o da nota longa e \n\ntamanho do macho, caracter\u00edsticas que podem estar sob sele\u00e7\u00e3o pela f\u00eamea. Houve correla\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npositiva entre a temperatura do ar e dura\u00e7\u00e3o da nota longa e negativa entre a temperatura do ar \n\ne a taxa de repeti\u00e7\u00e3o de pulsos. Durante os experimentos de playback, os machos n\u00e3o \n\nalteraram a propor\u00e7\u00e3o de notas curtas e longas quando simulamos um intruso, mas sim, \n\nalteraram par\u00e2metros das notas curtas originais; esse canto modulado foi classificado como \n\ncanto agressivo. Nossos resultados sugerem que as notas curtas s\u00e3o o componente agressivo \n\ndo canto misto, enquanto as notas longas devem ser o componente de an\u00fancio. Sendo esta \n\nesp\u00e9cie end\u00eamica e fortemente associada a matas de galeria, acreditamos que nossos dados \n\nser\u00e3o extremamente \u00fateis para a\u00e7\u00f5es de manejo e conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Anuros; reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o; territorialidade; atividade de vocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o; Cerrado. \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nBrazil is the country with the greatest amphibian anuran diversity, with almost 850 species \n\ndescribed. Despite the increasing efforts and increase in the studies, the basic biology of the \n\nBrazilian anuran species is poorly known. The reproductive biology of Bokermannohyla \n\nibitiguara, a hylid frog endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado, probably the most threatened \n\nsavanna in the world, was studied in 17 field expeditions between August/2010 and \n\nJuly/2011.This species is a prolonged breeder, with males calling from October to June. \n\nMales used a variety of calling sites along the gallery forests of streams. The reproductive \n\ninvestment of males (gonad mass/body mass) was 0.29% and that of females was 20.26%. \n\nFemales contained a mean of 202 mature oocytes in the ovaries, each with a mean diameter of \n\n1.96 mm, and the reproductive mode of the species is similar to mode 4: eggs and early larval \n\nstages in natural or constructed basins in streams. Herein, we described the complex courtship \n\nbehavior of the species, involving tactile and acoustic stimuli, a male-male fight, and the fight \n\ncalls. Satellite males were observed and mean body size was similar to that of calling males. \n\nMales emit a mixed call, composed by short and long notes, suggesting different functions. \n\nThere was a negative correlation between dominant frequency of the call and male body size, \n\nand a positive correlation between long note duration and male body size, which might be \n\nunder sexual selection pressure. Air temperature correlated positively with long note duration \n\nand negatively with pulse rate. During the playback experiments with males, they did not alter \n\nthe proportion of long to short notes when simulating an intruder, but rather they vary some \n\nacoustic parameters of the original short notes; this modulated call was classified as \n\naggressive call. Our results suggest that short notes are the aggressive component of the \n\nmixed call, while long notes might be the advertisement component. Since this species is \n\nendemic and strongly associated with gallery forests, we believe that our data might be very \n\nuseful for conservation practices. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Anurans; reproduction; territoriality; calling activity; Cerrado. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O GERAL \n\n \n\nAtualmente s\u00e3o conhecidas aproximadamente 6000 esp\u00e9cies de anf\u00edbios anuros (Frost, \n\n2011), sendo que a maior riqueza encontra-se na Am\u00e9rica tropical (Duellman, 1988).

Diante das amea\u00e7as \n\nque os anf\u00edbios v\u00eam sofrendo nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, com a extin\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies e o decl\u00ednio de \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es em v\u00e1rias partes do mundo, provocadas, principalmente, por altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos \n\nh\u00e1bitats e doen\u00e7as (e.g. Becker et al., 2007; Loyola et al., 2008; Becker &amp; Zamudio, 2011), \n\nestudos sobre a biologia das esp\u00e9cies s\u00e3o de extrema urg\u00eancia. V\u00e1rios aspectos podem ser \n\nabordados dentro da biologia dos anuros, como comportamento social e reprodutivo (cuidado \n\nparental, vocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, territorialidade), distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e temporal, preda\u00e7\u00e3o, competi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nintra e interespec\u00edfica, defesa, entre outros (Duellman &amp; Trueb, 1994; Wells, 2007). \n\nEstudos sobre a biologia reprodutiva das esp\u00e9cies de anuros t\u00eam aumentado na regi\u00e3o \n\nNeotropical (e.g. Martins, 1988; 1993; Haddad &amp; Cardoso, 1992; Brasileiro, 1998; Freitas et \n\nal., 2001; Wogel et al., 2002; Giasson, 2003; Menin &amp; Giaretta, 2004; Toledo, 2004), \n\ndescrevendo, por exemplo, a temporada de atividade reprodutiva das popula\u00e7\u00f5es, geralmente \n\nbaseada na atividade de vocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de machos (Pombal Jr., 1997; Bernarde &amp; Machado, \n\n2001; Toledo et al., 2003), e discutindo a interfer\u00eancia de fatores abi\u00f3ticos \u2013 como a \n\npluviosidade \u2013 sobre a atividade reprodutiva (Aichinger, 1987; Praderio &amp; Robinson, 1990). \n\nA pr\u00f3pria atividade de vocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido objeto de estudo dentro desta \u00e1rea (Martins &amp; \n\nHaddad, 1988; Zina &amp; Haddad, 2005; Junc\u00e1 e Lugli, 2009). Entretanto, apesar destes \n\ncrescentes esfor\u00e7os, existem menos herpet\u00f3logos na regi\u00e3o Neotropical comparado \u00e0s regi\u00f5es \n\ntemperadas, e a biologia da maioria das esp\u00e9cies \u00e9 praticamente desconhecida (Kriger, 2010). \n\nOutro ponto cr\u00edtico \u00e9 que nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas a descri\u00e7\u00e3o de novas esp\u00e9cies tem sido mais \n\nacelerada (e.g. Ara\u00fajo et al., 2009), cujo ritmo n\u00e3o \u00e9 acompanhado pelos estudos em biologia \n\ndas esp\u00e9cies. \n\nEstudos sobre sele\u00e7\u00e3o sexual e territorialidade em anuros da regi\u00e3o Neotropical s\u00e3o \n\nainda mais escassos (e.g. Lips, 2005; Giasson &amp; Haddad, 2007), se comparado aos estudos \n\nem regi\u00f5es temperadas (e.g. Licht, 1976; Davies &amp; Halliday, 1977; Howard &amp; Kluge, 1985; \n\nWoolbright, 1989; Howard et al., 1994; Katsikaros &amp; Shine, 1997). Dada a complexidade dos \n\necossistemas neotropicais, \u00e9 de se esperar que o estudo e entendimento dos processos de \n\nsele\u00e7\u00e3o sexual e intera\u00e7\u00f5es territoriais entre machos que aqui ocorrem contribuam de forma \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n \n\nexpressiva para o conhecimento que j\u00e1 \u00e9 bastante avan\u00e7ado nas regi\u00f5es temperadas (Wells, \n\n2007). Muitos grupos de pesquisa nas regi\u00f5es temperadas desenvolveram in\u00fameros e \n\nconsistentes estudos sobre poucas esp\u00e9cies (e.g. Ryan, 1983; Gerhardt &amp; Doherty, 1988; Ryan \n\net al., 1990; Gerhardt &amp; Brooks, 2009), enquanto nossa grande quantidade de esp\u00e9cies \n\npermanece inexplorada. \n\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o, dividida em dois cap\u00edtulos, teve como objetivo estudar a biologia \n\nreprodutiva de Bokermannohyla ibitiguara Cardoso (1983), end\u00eamica do Cerrado brasileiro, \n\ncuja biologia praticamente desconhecida conferiu \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie o status de Dados Deficientes pela \n\nIUCN (Caramaschi and Eterovick, 2004). O primeiro cap\u00edtulo aborda sua biologia b\u00e1sica, \n\ndescrevendo s\u00edtios de vocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos machos, organiza\u00e7\u00e3o do coro, padr\u00e3o temporal de \n\nreprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, distribui\u00e7\u00e3o temporal, modo reprodutivo, investimento reprodutivo de machos e \n\nf\u00eameas e intera\u00e7\u00f5es sociais entre machos e f\u00eameas (e.g. comportamento de corte, briga entre \n\nmachos, macho sat\u00e9lite). O primeiro cap\u00edtulo est\u00e1 apresentado em ingl\u00eas, nas normas da \n\nrevista Amphibia-Reptilia, para a qual foi submetido recentemente. O segundo cap\u00edtulo, \n\ntamb\u00e9m redigido em ingl\u00eas na forma de manuscrito, aborda a quest\u00e3o da atividade de \n\nvocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos machos em si, atrav\u00e9s de observa\u00e7\u00e3o direta e experimentos de playback com \n\nmachos em campo. A fun\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes partes do canto foi investigada, bem como a \n\ndescri\u00e7\u00e3o de um canto agressivo especializado e de um canto de briga, al\u00e9m de avaliar \n\ncorrela\u00e7\u00f5es entre par\u00e2metros do canto e tamanho do corpo dos machos e temperatura. \n\nO estudo foi realizado na \u00e1rea rural do munic\u00edpio de Sacramento (19\u00b051\u2019S; 47\u00b026\u2019O), \n\nestado de Minas Gerais, em fazendas pr\u00f3ximas \u00e0 represa de Peixoto (fig. 1A). As observa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ne coletas foram realizadas em tr\u00eas riachos: i) riacho permanente 1 (20\u00ba16\u201921,9\u201dS; \n\n47\u00ba04\u201924,5\u201dO; altitude 677 m; fig. 1B), ii) riacho tempor\u00e1rio (20\u00ba13\u201909,9\u201dS; 47\u00ba06\u201921\u201dO; \n\naltitude 880 m; fig. 1C) e iii) riacho permanente 2 (20\u00ba12\u201920,1\u201dS; 47\u00ba07\u201953,6O\u201d, altitude 839 \n\nm; fig. 1D). \n\nO clima da regi\u00e3o \u00e9 classificado como mesot\u00e9rmico de inverno seco (Araujo et al., \n\n2009). O relevo \u00e9 bastante montanhoso, apresentando topos achatados e arredondados, com \n\nencostas escarpadas em forma de cuestas e c\u00e2nions, predominando os latossolos. A paisagem \n\n\u00e9 formada por cerrad\u00f5es, cerrados e campos nos interfl\u00favios, florestas de galeria cont\u00ednuas no \n\nfundo e nos flancos dos baixos vales, tamb\u00e9m estando presente a floresta estacional decidual \n\n(ver Araujo et al., 2009). Romero &amp; Nakajima (1999), em refer\u00eancia a Serra da Canastra, \n\nlocalizada a aproximadamente 60 km da \u00e1rea de estudo, descrevem os tipos de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncomo sendo florestas mes\u00f3filas de encosta, cap\u00f5es, cerrad\u00e3o, cerrado, campo cerrado, campo \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n \n\nlimpo e campo rupestre. Haddad et al. (1988) caracterizam a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o do Parque Nacional da \n\nSerra da Canastra como constitu\u00edda de campos rupestres, com pequenas manchas de cerrado e \n\nmatas de galeria. O clima \u00e9 marcadamente sazonal, com um ver\u00e3o quente e chuvoso (outubro \n\na mar\u00e7o) e um inverno seco (abril a setembro), com precipita\u00e7\u00e3o total anual entre 1300 \u2013 1700 \n\nmm de chuva (Queirolo &amp; Motta-Junior, 2007). \n\n \n\n \nFigura 1.

This is the case of Bokermannohyla ibitiguara, a stream-dweller treefrog endemic \n\nto the Cerrado of southeastern Brazil. The species is classified as \"Data Deficient\" by the \n\nIUCN, thus, herein we describe the species\u2019 reproductive biology. Fieldwork was conducted \n\nfrom August 2010 to July 2011. The reproductive activity occurred from October to June and \n\nwas positively correlated with air temperature, air humidity, and monthly rainfall. Individuals \n\nwere observed only in gallery forests at the margins of streams and males used different \n\nsubstrates as calling sites. Males did not aggregate in specific parts of the streams and \n\ndistance among males was higher in the dry season. Males and females did not differ in \n\nlenght, but females without mature oocytes were lighter than males. The reproductive \n\ninvestment of males (gonad mass/body mass) was 0.29% and that of females was 20.26%. \n\nFemales contained a mean of 202 \u00b1 75 mature oocytes in the ovaries, each with a mean \n\ndiameter of 1.96 \u00b1 0.16 mm. We describe, for the first time for the genus, a complex courtship \n\nbehaviour and also male-male fight and satellite behaviour. The Cerrado is probably the most \n\nthreatened savanna in the world, being intensively modified in the last decades. Endemic \n\nspecies associated to gallery forests, such as B. ibitiguara, are highly vulnerable to habitat \n\nalterations. Thus, our study provides important data on the species\u2019 biology, which might be \n\nvery useful for conservation practices. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Bokermannohyla ibitiguara, Hylidae, courtship behaviour, calling sites, temporal \n\ndistribution \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nCurrently, 5966 amphibian anurans are known in the world (Frost, 2011), with the \n\nhighest diversity found in the American tropics (Duellman, 1988). The greatest anuran \n\nrichness, 847 species, is found in Brazil (SBH, 2011), with approximately 60% of endemism \n\n(Vasconcelos and Rossa-Feres, 2005). Despite the great diversity, in the Neotropics, \n\napproximately 35% of the amphibians are endangered due to habitat loss or fragmentation, as \n\nwell as a result of habitat split (Becker et al., 2007; Loyola et al., 2008). Habitat loss is \n\nconsidered the greatest threat to Brazilian amphibians (Silvano and Segalla, 2005), probably \n\nbecause of alteration or complete elimination of specific humid microhabitats used by the \n\nspecies (Beebee, 1996; Young et al., 2000). Furthermore, there are fewer herpetologists in the \n\nNeotropics compared to temperate regions and its huge fauna is still poorly known (Kriger, \n\n2010). This is a dangerous combination of facts for anuran diversity conservation, making \n\nurgent the study of species\u2019 natural history and ecology.  \n\nAlthough studies on anuran natural history have increased in the Neotropical region, \n\nmost of them focus on forest species from the Amazon or the Atlantic forest domain (e.g. \n\nCanelas and Bertoluci, 2007; Bernarde and Kokubum, 2009; Montanarin, Kaefer and Lima, \n\n2011). The biology of anuran species from open habitats, such as the Cerrado, although \n\nwidely distributed and commonly observed in the field, are much less studied (e.g. Brasileiro \n\net al., 2005; Giaretta et al., 2008; Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2011). The Brazilian Cerrado is the second \n\nlargest South American domain, with an original area of approximately 2.5 million square \n\nkilometers (Silva et al., 2006), mostly composed by grasslands, seasonal savannas, and \n\ncorridors of gallery forests. The Cerrado is the largest, most species-rich, and probably most \n\nthreatened tropical savanna in the world (Silva and Bates, 2002), thus included among the 25 \n\nmost threatened hotspots on Earth (Myers et al., 2000). This open formation in central South \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n \n\nAmerica harbors approximately 204 anuran species (Valdujo, 2011) and has been intensively \n\nmodified in the last 40 years, primarily due to urban and agricultural development; currently \n\nonly 20% of its original area remains and only about 6% of that area is legally protected \n\n(Myers et al., 2000). \n\nThe genus Bokermannohyla (Faivovich et al., 2005) includes 29 hylid species, \n\ndistributed in Center, South and Southestern Brazil (Frost, 2011). Together with the genera \n\nHyloscirtus, Miersiohyla, Hypsiboas and Aplastodiscus they form the Cophomantini tribe, a \n\nwell-supported clade (Faivovich et al., 2005; D\u2019Heursel and Haddad, 2007). Bokermannohyla \n\nibitiguara (Cardoso, 1983) is a stream-dweller frog, endemic to the Cerrado in Southeastern \n\nBrazil. The species is currently placed in the B. pseudopseudis group, with B. alvarengai, B. \n\npseudopseudis, B. saxicola, B. oxente, and B. itapoty (Faivovich et al., 2005; Frost, 2011). \n\nGeneral information on its natural history can be found in the original description (Cardoso, \n\n1983). It is a medium-size species with robust body, males\u2019 call is composed by primary and \n\nsecondary notes, and adults inhabit rocky environments along small streams (Cardoso, 1983). \n\nPopulation status is unknown and reproductive habits had never been published in detail. \n\nThus, B. ibitiguara is currently included in the Data Deficient category by the IUCN \n\n(Caramaschi and Eterovick, 2004).  \n\nHerein, we describe the reproductive biology of B. ibitiguara, including habitat use \n\npatterns, breeding period, and social behaviours, such as a complex courtship and male-male \n\nfight, both described for the first time for the genus Bokermannohyla. Moreover, following \n\nthe reccomendation of Pimenta et al. (2005), that researchers should concentrate efforts to \n\nstudy Data Defficient species to obtain information on their population status, we believe that \n\nthe results reported here will not only increase our knowledge on the basic biology of the \n\nspecies, but also might be extremely useful for conservation practices. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nStudy area \n\nFieldwork was conducted in private farms in the municipality of Sacramento \n\n(19\u00b051\u2019S; 47\u00b026\u2019W), Minas Gerais state, Southeastern Brazil. Three streams were sampled: \n\n(i) permanent stream 1 (20\u00ba16\u201921.9\u201dS; 47\u00ba04\u201924.5\u201dW; 677 m elevation); (ii) temporary stream \n\n(20\u00ba13\u201909.9\u201dS; 47\u00ba06\u201921\u201dW; 880 m elevation), and (iii) permanent stream 2 (20\u00ba12\u201920.1\u201dS; \n\n47\u00ba07\u201953.6\u201dW, 839 m elevation). \n\nThe study area is located at about 60 km from the Serra da Canastra National Park. \n\nThe climate is markedly seasonal, with a hot and rainy summer (October to March) and a dry \n\nwinter (April to September), with total annual precipitation between 1300-1700 mm (Queirolo \n\nand Motta-Junior, 2007). The topography is mountainous, with flat or rounded hills, reaching \n\nup to 1500 m elevation, with deep valleys and many streams (Dietz, 1984). The landscape \n\nconsists of savannas, locally named as Cerrado vegetation, grassland fields at higher \n\nelevations, gallery forests in the valleys along streams, and patches of semideciduous forest \n\n(Dietz, 1984; Araujo, Condez and Sawaya, 2009). \n\n \n\nData collection  \n\nSeventeen field expeditions yielded 190 hours of observations on the natural history of \n\nB. ibitiguara throughout a whole year (August 2010 to July 2011). Two field expeditions per \n\nmonth were made in the rainy season, except for March (n = 11 expeditions) and one per \n\nmonth in the dry season (n = 6 expeditions). \n\nIndividuals were found by active search guided by male vocalizations and were \n\nobserved with flashlights. To reduce the interference of luminosity on the frogs\u2019 behaviour, \n\nred lights were used (e.g. Sazima and Pombal-Jr., 1986; Miranda et al., 2008; Mott and \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n \n\nSparling, 2009), avoiding, whenever possible, to point the light focus directly toward the \n\nindividuals (Toledo, 2004). To examine some reproductive traits (see item below), 27 \n\nindividuals were hand-captured, anesthetized with lidocaine 10%, fixed in formalin 10%, and \n\npreserved in alcohol 70% (McDiarmid, 1994).  \n\n \n\nHabitat use \n\nHabitat use by individuals of B. ibitiguara was registered monthly, describing male \n\nvocalization site, such as leaf, trunk, branch, inside water, inside hidden places, and on the \n\nground, also evaluating male abundance in each type of substrate. We also measured \n\nhorizontal distance from the water (DFW), height above water (HAW), height above ground \n\n(HAG), and distance to the nearest neighbor (DNN), this last one divided into categories (less \n\nthan 1 m; 1 to 5 m; 5 to 10 m and over 10 m). We performed a Chi-squared test for the \n\nfrequencies of less than 5 m and more than 5 m, comparing the DNN between the rainy \n\nseason (Oct \u2013 Mar) and dry season (Apr \u2013 Sep). \n\n \n\nTemporal distribution and temporal breeding pattern \n\nThe numbers of calling males and active females were registered every night. Data on \n\nrain and air humidity were obtained from the meteorological station of the municipality of \n\nSacramento, by the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), and the air and water \n\ntemperatures were registered at each stream with an annalogical thermometer. To verify \n\nabiotic effects on species activity we performed a multiple correlation analysis, using \n\nKendall\u2019s rank coefficient (Zar, 1999). The species\u2019s breeding pattern was classified as \n\nprolonged or explosive, according to Wells (1977a). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n \n\nBody size and reproductive traits \n\nMale and female body mass and snout-vent lenght (SVL) were measured in the field \n\nwith a dynamometer (0.1 g) and an analogic caliper (0.05 mm), respectively. Males were \n\nrecognized by the presence of secondary sexual traits: developed prepollex, hypertrophied \n\nforearm, and yellowish vocal sac. To verify the occurrence of sexual size dimorphism (SSD), \n\nmean values were compared through a Student\u2019s t-test (Zar, 1999). \n\nReproductive mode of the species was determined (sensu Haddad and Prado, 2005). \n\nSince we did not find any clutches in the field, mature oocytes in the ovaries of gravid \n\nfemales were analyzed to obtain information on clutch and egg size. Diameter of \n\napproximately 10 oocytes per female was measured under a Leica stereomicroscope with a \n\nphoto capturing software (Leica Application Suite). To examine the relationship between \n\nfemale body size and clutch size, Spearman correlation analysis was performed between the \n\nvariables: (i) female SVL vs. n oocytes in the ovaries, and (ii) female body mass vs. ovary \n\nmass. The same analysis was also used to verify if there was a tradeoff between oocyte \n\nnumber and oocyte size. \n\nThe reproductive investment (RI) was calculated for both males and females as the \n\npercentage of gonad mass/body mass (Prado and Haddad, 2005). Body and gonad mass were \n\nmeasured in a digital balance (0.001 g). Males collected in a preliminary field trip, in January \n\n2010, were also used. \n\n \n\nSocial interaction observations \n\nTo study social interactions, we used the methods of focal-animal sampling, all \n\noccurrences sampling, and sequence sampling (Altmann, 1974). Animals were recognized \n\nthrough natural skin marks (spots, scars, etc.; Bradfield, 2004). Females and males were \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n \n\ndifferentiated in the field by the secondary sexual traits described above. Digital photo, audio, \n\nand video recordings were made whenever possible. \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\n \n\nHabitat use and chorus structure \n\nMales of Bokermannohyla ibitiguara were observed calling only inside the gallery \n\nforests, along the streams encovered by the canopy. They were found calling from tree or \n\nshrub leaves (56.6%; n = 129), trunks (21.9%; n = 50), branches (10.1%; n = 23), inside \n\nhidden places \u2013 among roots and leaves, under rocks or fallen trunks \u2013 (7.5%; n = 17), on the \n\nground (2.2%; n = 5), and partially submersed in the water (1.8%; n = 4; fig. 1). When males \n\ncalled perched, they could be either above the water or above the ground: mean HAW was \n\n1.13 \u00b1 0.89 m (range 0 \u2013 2.93 m; n = 67 observations) and mean HAG was 0.99 \u00b1 0.74 m \n\n(range 0 \u2013 2.93 m; n = 136). In the last case, mean DFW was 0.67 \u00b1 0.64 m (range 0.05 \u2013 3.54 \n\nm; n = 117). Most commonly, males called parallel to the ground (92%; n = 210), but also in \n\nvertical or diagonal position (8%; n = 18) relative to the ground. \n\n Considering chorus structure, calling males did not aggregate at specific sites, but \n\nrather they were distributed sparsely along the streams. Only 4.3% of males participating in \n\nthe chorus were less than 1 m from the nearest calling male, 45.7% were distant between 1 \n\nand 5 m, 19.7% between 5 and 10 m, and 30.3% were farther than 10 m from the nearest \n\ncalling male. Comparing the frequencies between seasons, males tend to be closer (&lt;5 m) to \n\neach other in the rainy season, and more distant (> 5 m) in the dry season (Chi-square ?21 = \n\n10.21, P &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n \n\nTemporal distribution and temporal breeding pattern \n\nCalling males of B. ibitiguara were found from October to June (fig. 2). Adult females \n\nwere found from November to February and in April. Bokermannohyla ibitiguara exhibited a \n\nprolonged breeding pattern (sensu Wells, 1977a; see discussion). \n\nMaximum number of calling males per month correlated significantly with air \n\ntemperature (Kendall\u2019s rank coefficient ? = 0.48, P &lt;0.05), relative air humidity (? = 0.68, P &lt;\n\n0.05), and total monthly rainfall (? = 0.60, P &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\nBody size and reproductive traits \n\nAverage SVL and mass of males and females are shown in table 1. The population \n\nshowed no SSD for SVL (Student\u2019s t-test t74 = -0.05, P = 0.96), but females without eggs \n\nwere significantly lighter than males (t73 = 2.59, P &lt;0.05). \n\nAlthough we were not able to observe the oviposition site, as individuals were hidden \n\nin rock crevices or under fallen trunks (see description below), the reproductive mode of B. \n\nibitiguara is probably similar to mode 4 (sensu Haddad and Prado, 2005): eggs and early \n\nlarval stages in natural or constructed basins; subsequent to flooding, exotrophic tadpoles in \n\nstreams. During observation of courtship 1 and 2 (see below), it was possible to recognize two \n\nlikely oviposition sites: (1) a basin covered by leaves and a fallen trunk, with 10 cm diameter \n\nand 5.5 cm deep, and (2) a cavity in the stream\u2019s banks, with 20 cm between end of the cavity \n\nand beginning of the stream water. The first site is probably a natural basin. \n\nWe did not find any clutches in the field, probably because oviposition sites were in \n\nhidden locations. Clutch size and egg diameter were then estimated by analyzing mature \n\noocytes from gravid females (table 1). Oocytes were black on the animal pole and beige on \n\nthe vegetative pole. One female spawned one single egg while kept in the plastic bag, and its \n\ndiameter was 1.99 mm inside an individual jelly capsule with 3.4 mm of diameter. Males \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n \n \n\ninvested approximately 0.3% of their body mass in gonads and females 20.3% (table 1). \n\nFemale body mass and ovary mass were positively correlated (Spearman correlation rs4 = \n\n0.90, P &lt;0.05, n = 6), but n oocytes and oocyte diameter were not correlated (rs4 = -0.54, P = \n\n0.26, n = 6), neither were female SVL and n eggs (rs4 = 0.49, P = 0.32, n = 6). \n\n \n\nCourtship behaviour, male territoriality, and satellite males \n\nWe observed three sequences of courtship behaviour: courtship 1 and 2 with the same \n\nfemale, on 18 January, 2011 (air temperature = 21\u00b0C), and courtship 3 on 28 February, 2011 \n\n(air temperature = 22\u00b0C). The male calls, attracting the female; when she approaches, they \n\nstand face to face and he slaps the female at her side, once or twice, guiding her to the nest, \n\nwhere she enters to inspect. The basic events of B. ibitiguara courtship are summarized in fig. \n\n3; however, there were some differences among the three courtships (table 2). \n\nDuring courtship number 2, a satellite male followed the pair quietly. Although he was \n\nnoticed by the pair, the courtship occurred normally. After the courtship, they all entered the \n\noviposition site, inside a cavity amidst the rocks, and the resident male kept calling for about \n\nfive more minutes. Then, the resident stopped calling for another 5 min, and this should be the \n\ntotal time of oviposition (see discussion below). Afterwards, both the resident male and \n\nfemale left the oviposition site, and the satellite male remained inside. After a while, the \n\nsatellite male began to call inside the cavity and the resident male approached and called \n\ntoward the satellite male. Following, the resident male entered the cavity and different sounds \n\nwere emitted, probably fight calls (Chapter 2). After that, both males jumped off the cavity \n\ninto the water stream, and it was possible to observe the fight (fig. 4A). They remained \n\nclasped chest to chest, using their prepollical spines to injure the opponent\u2019s head region (e.g., \n\neyes and the tympanum). The fight lasted about 18 min, but at the final 6 min, the satellite \n\nmale simply subdued the resident male, until they released themselves. The satellite male won \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe fight and remained calling inside the cavity. He was larger (SVL = 41.6 mm) and heavier \n\n(body mass = 5.44 g) than the calling male (38.75 mm, 4.5 g). Many scars became visible on \n\nthe resident\u2019s head (fig. 4B). \n\nSatellite behaviour was observed many times during the study (n = 20 satellite males), \n\nwhere non-calling males remained next to males that were calling. In two occasions we \n\nobserved two satellite males next to one calling male. Average distance between satellite and \n\ncalling male was 54 \u00b1 29 cm (range 15 \u2013 100 cm; n = 13). Mean SVL of satellite males was \n\n39.2 mm (n = 9) and mean mass was 4.32 g (n = 8); mean SVL of calling males was 39.3 mm \n\n(n = 8) and mean mass was 4.50 g (n = 7). Satellite and calling males did not differ \n\nsignificantly neither in SVL (t15 = 2.13, P = 0.95) nor in mass (t13 = 2.16, P = 0.76). \n\n \n\nDISCUSSION \n\n \n\nBokermannohyla ibitiguara males used a great variety of microhabitats for calling. \n\nEterovick et al. (2010) presented some data about microhabitat use for other Bokermannohyla \n\nspecies [(B. martinsi, B. nanuzae, B. saxicola, and Bokemannohyla sp. (gr. circumdata)], \n\nallowing comparison. Adults of B. ibitiguara showed the greatest variation in microhabitat \n\nuse, followed by B. nanuzae; B. saxicola, both species in the B. pseudopseudis group, which \n\nused only three types of microhabitats (rocks, leaves, and branches). Bokermannohyla \n\nsaxicola and B. nanuzae showed the shortest distance from the water (average 0.18 and 0.32 \n\nm, respectively), followed by B. ibitiguara (average 0.67 m). In terms of height (above \n\nground or water), all species remain closer to the substrate compared to B. ibitiguara, except \n\nfor Bokermannohyla sp. (gr. circumdata), which showed an average height varying from 1.38 \n\nto 2.67 m. \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n \n\nDuring this study, adults of B. ibitiguara were always in the interior of the gallery \n\nforests, associated with the streams. Considering species in the B. pseudopseudis group, \n\nwhich occur predominantly in open formations, B. oxente and B. itapoty also have association \n\nwith riparian vegetation (Lugli and Haddad, 2006a,b), but B. alvarengai and B. saxicola seem \n\nto breed in streams without vegetation (Eterovick and Sazima, 2000). The dependence on \n\nforested areas and streams is also known for other species of Bokermannohyla (B. circumdata, \n\nB. hylax, B. izecksohni, and B. luctuosa), as well as species in the related genus Aplastodiscus \n\n(A. albosignatus, A. arildae, A. callipygius, A. ehrhardti, A. leucopygius) (Haddad, Toledo \n\nand Prado, 2008), all species typical of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain. At our study \n\nsite, even with the riparian vegetation being fragmented in many portions and presenting \n\nroads nearby, males were able to use a great variety of microhabitats as calling sites, \n\nsuggesting that B. ibitiguara is, at some extant, resistant to human alterations. However, as \n\nthe species is strongly associated to gallery forests and streams, it is mandatory to preserve \n\nthese habitats properly. \n\nCalling males of B. ibitiguara tended to be closer to each other during the rainy season \n\ncompared to the dry season. This suggests that calling males seem to spread themselves along \n\nthe water bodies as much as possible, but in the rainy season, when male density is higher, \n\nthey end up being closer to each other. The organization of calling males in choruses in \n\nspecific parts of the water bodies has advantages, for example by increasing female attraction \n\nefficiency and decreasing individual exposure and predation risk (Ryan, Tuttle and Taft, \n\n1981; Wells, 2007). However, for B. ibitiguara, as males are extremely territorial, it is \n\nprobably more profitable to remain as far as possible from each other, avoiding costs \n\nassociated to territorial conflicts (e.g. male wounds; this study). \n\nCalling activity of B. ibitiguara males was positively correlated with air humidity, air \n\ntemperature, and total rainfall. This result was expected, since high temperatures and rains are \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n \n\nknown to strongly influence the reproductive activity of anurans in the neotropics (Eterovick \n\nand Sazima, 2000; Bertoluci and Rodrigues, 2002; Prado, Uetanabaro and Haddad, 2005). \n\nAlso, air humidity is another factor that undoubtedly limits breeding activity of frogs, \n\nalthough few studies have actually tested this prediction (e.g. Cree, 1989). B. ibitiguara is a \n\ntypical prolonged breeder (sensu Wells, 1977a), because (i) males called during several \n\nmonths (Oct \u2013 Jun), (ii) we did not observe females arriving synchronously to the \n\nreproductive site, and (iii) breeding activity did not increase significantly after heavy rains, as \n\nobserved for some explosive breeders at the study site (e.g. Scinax fuscovarius and \n\nElachistocleis sp.; pers. obs.). Furthermore, other explosive breeder traits were not observed, \n\nsuch as active search for females or males intercepting females. \n\nContrary to most anurans, where females are larger than males (Shine 1979), B. \n\nibitiguara showed no SSD in SVL, as previously observed for other species in the B. \n\npseudopseudis group: B. oxente (Lugli and Haddad, 2006a), B. saxicola (Eterovick and \n\nSazima, 2004), and B. alvarengai (Lugli and Haddad, 2006b). Actually, in this last case, \n\nSazima and Bokermann (1977) observed that males are larger than females. Differently, \n\nfemales of B. itapoty are larger than males (Lugli and Haddad, 2006b). However, B. \n\nibitiguara males were significantly heavier than females without eggs, probably because \n\nfemales showed a high reproductive investment (RI) (average 20.26%), as already observed \n\nfor other anurans, such as Leptodactylus chaquensis (RI = 16%; Prado and Haddad, 2005), \n\nPhysalaemus albonotatus (RI = 16.6%; Prado and Haddad, 2005) and P. crombiei (RI = \n\n32.06%; Pupin et al., 2010). Since we found a positive correlation between female body mass \n\nvs. ovary mass, we suggest that there is a selective pressure towards female fecundity increase \n\nand, therefore, female body size increase (the fecundity advantage hypothesis; Darwin, 1874). \n\nThis hypothesis has constantly been proposed to explain larger females in different animal \n\ngroups (e.g. Head, 1995; Brana, 1996), including anurans (e.g. Shine, 1979; Kupfer, 2007). \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe size-fecundity relationship was not significant between the variables n oocytes vs. \n\nfemale SVL, which could be explained by the small sample size, but also because oocyte size \n\nwas highly variable among females. Intraspecific variation in egg size has been reported for \n\nother anuran species (e. g. Rafi?ska, 1991; Kaplan and King, 1997; Camargo, Sarroca and \n\nManeyro, 2008). However, in B. ibitiguara this variation was not explained as a tradeoff \n\nbetween oocyte number and oocyte size, which could also be due to the small number of \n\ngravid females analyzed here. \n\nThe RI of males was low (average 0.29%), compared to some other frogs (e.g. \n\nRhacophorus arboreus: 5.15%; R. schlegelii: 1.06%; Kusano, Toda and Fukuyama, 1991; \n\nLeptodactylus chaquensis: 4.13%; L. podicipinus 0.75%; Prado and Haddad, 2003; Scinax \n\nfuscovarius: 1.21%; Rodrigues, Uetanabaro and Lopes, 2005). High RI measured as relative \n\ntestes size in anuran males are generally associated to the occurrence of multi-male spawning \n\nand sperm competition (Emerson, 1997; Prado and Haddad, 2003; Rodrigues, Uetanabaro and \n\nLopes, 2005), term defined by Parker (1970). The basic idea of this concept is that a male \n\nwith larger testes would increase the probability of fertilizing female\u2019s oocytes when breeding \n\nsimultaneously with other males. On the other hand, low RI for males, as we found in B. \n\nibitiguara, might occur when there is low risk of sperm competition, for example: (i) in \n\nspecies in which the female interacts with only one male during a complex courtship and \n\ndeposit eggs in a hidden place, as observed here and previously reported for species in the \n\ngenus Leptodactylus (Prado and Haddad, 2003), and/or (ii) in species in which males actively \n\ndefend their territories, engaging in fights, reducing the probability of multi-male spawning, \n\nas observed for B. ibitiguara. As a result, we hypothesize that although it seems to exist a \n\nstrong selective pressure towards female fecundity increase, which could lead to female body \n\nsize increase, the presence of male-male fights tends to select larger males as well (see Shine, \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n \n\n1989; Katsikaros and Shine, 1997). Consequently, B. ibitiguara males and females do not \n\ndiffer in SVL. \n\nMany species of the genus Bokermannohyla deposit their eggs in flowing waters, \n\nwhich is described as reproductive mode number 2 (e.g. Bokermannohyla alvarengai, B. \n\nnanuzae e B. sazimai; Haddad and Prado, 2005). However, other species are known to deposit \n\ntheir egss in standing water, as B. luctuosa (Haddad and Sawaya, 2000), or in natural or \n\nconstructed basins in both lotic or lentic environments (modes 1 and 4, respectively; Haddad e \n\nPrado, 2005). From our observations, we suggest that B. ibitiguara exhibits a variation of \n\nreproductive mode number 4, depositing eggs in lotic environments, probably in basins in \n\nhidden places, such as rock crevices or amidst fallen leaves or trunks. \n\nThe courtship in B. ibitiguara is relatively complex, involving accoustic and tactile \n\nstimuli, during which the male guides the female toward his nest and the female can inspect it. \n\nThis is the first description of courtship for the genus Bokermannohyla. A similar courtship is \n\nknown for other species in the Cophomantini tribe, such as some species of Aplastodicus \n\n(Haddad and Sawaya, 2000; Hartmann, Hartmann and Haddad, 2004; Zina and Haddad, \n\n2007). However, the process from female arrival until her entrance in the nest lasted much \n\nless time in B. ibitiguara than compared to Aplastodiscus species: in B. ibitiguara, the first \n\ncourtship lasted about one hour, and the other two, about 30 minutes, whereas in \n\nAplastodiscus the courtship can last many hours (Haddad and Sawaya, 2000; Hartmann, \n\nHartmann and Haddad, 2004; Zina and Haddad, 2007). Another difference is that the tactile \n\nstimulus in B. ibitiguara, when the male reaches the female, is similar to a slap and it is \n\nsomewhat aggressive, while in Aplastodiscus there is only one ore more soft touches. \n\nConsidering aggressiveness itself, the stimulus in B. ibitiguara is more similar to the one \n\nreported for the eleutherodactylid Diasporus diastema, where the male bumps the female, \n\nalmost making her fall off the perch (Ovaska and Rand, 2001). \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n \n\nFemale inspection of male nest has been previously reported for other species in the \n\nCophomantini tribe (e.g. species of Aplastodiscus: Zina and Haddad, 2007; Hypsiboas faber: \n\nMartins and Haddad, 1988). In B. ibitiguara, it is possible that inspection can be decisive for \n\nmale rejection by the female, as observed in courtship 1 (this study). However, she can also \n\nreject the male prior to nest inspection, as in courtship 3 (this study), when the male remained \n\ncalling perched on a branch, there was no nest inspection, and the female moved towards \n\nanother male. The importance of female inspection of nests is an evidence that males with \n\nbetter territories can achieve higher reproductive success (e.g. Wells, 1977b), which can \n\nexplain why males of this species should risk themselves in fights. Scars were commonly \n\nfound in males of B. ibitiguara, which could have been caused by male fights, as observed \n\nonce in the present study.  \n\nWe did not observe any amplexus, but it probably occurred after courtship 2, inside \n\nthe groove cavity. After the female has left the cavity, she was collected and had almost no \n\nmature oocytes in her ovaries. Analyzing the abdominal cavity, we observed that the right \n\novary still had two mature oocytes and the oviduct was dilated, although the left ovary had \n\nonly atretic oocytes and the oviduct was not dilated. These evidences support the occurrence \n\nof amplexus and spawning in the cavity. In this case, the amplexus could have lasted at most \n\n10 minutes, which was the total time the calling male and the female remained inside the nest. \n\nShort amplexus and spawning have already been reported for other anuran species (e.g. \n\nGuibemantis liber: Blommers-Schl\u00f6sser, 1975; Crossodactylus gaudichaudii, 1 to 2 minutes: \n\nWeygoldt and Carvalho-e-Silva, 1992; Hyla cinerea,15 to 35 minutes under lab conditions: \n\nGarton and Brandon, 1975; Crinia georgiana, 23 minutes: Roberts et al., 1999). \n\nSatellite male behaviour is common in anurans with prolonged breeding season \n\n(Wells, 2007). We sometimes observed that when manipulating calling males, they stopped \n\ncalling and satellites started calling. This suggests that males of B. ibitiguara show plasticity \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n \n\nin the reproductive strategies, alternating between calling and satellite behaviour, as already \n\nobserved for other hylids (Perril, Gerhardt and Daniel, 1978; Haddad, 1991; Zina and Haddad, \n\n2006). In one occasion, a smaller satellite male approached a calling male (distance 15 cm) \n\nand remained still. At first, the calling male emitted an agressive call composed by short notes \n\nfacing the satellite male, but after that the resident male soon turned the other way around and \n\nkept calling normally. It was also observed that satellite males were less agressive then calling \n\nmales when manipulated; calling males tended to puncture our fingers with their spines. \n\nThese observations fit the concept of a more submissive behaviour of satellite male compared \n\nto the calling male (Emlen, 1976; Toledo and Haddad, 2005). However, during courtship 2, \n\nthe satellite male was agressive, larger and heavier, being able to defeat and take the calling \n\nmale territory. Also, on average, satellite males were the same size of calling males, as \n\ncommonly observed for hylids (e.g. Perril and Magier, 1988; Lance and Wells, 1993, Toledo \n\nand Haddad, 2005; Alcantara, Lima and Bastos, 2007). Thus, satellite behaviour in B. \n\nibitiguara males seems to depend on ecological factors rather than male size itself.  \n\nBokermannohyla ibitiguara reproduced for several months at the study site and \n\nindividuals were abundant in many streams. Moreover, the species occur in Southeastern \n\nBrazil, the most developed region of the country. However, besides the original description \n\n(Cardoso, 1983), little information had been previously published on the species\u2019 natural \n\nhistory. This highlights how poorly is our knowledge on anuran biology in Brazil, the world \n\nrichest country in anuran species (SBH, 2011). Natural history data is essential for \n\ncomprehending the reproductive strategies and social interactions in anurans, also raising \n\nquestions for future studies. Therefore, researchers should concentrate efforts in studying and \n\npublishing data on basic biology, mainly for Data Deficient species (IUCN), which will be \n\nuseful for studies focusing on other aspects, such as ethology, ecology, genetics, and \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n \n\nphylogeny. Also, natural history data might support conservation strategies, producing more \n\neffective results. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n \n\nWe would like to thank C. F. B.

The \n\ngladiator frog, Bokermannohyla ibitiguara, is a hylid endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado and \n\nhas a mixed call, composed by long and short notes. Vocalizations and social contexts of their \n\nemissions have never been studied before. Thus, herein, we describe the influence of male \n\nsize and temperature on call properties, and investigate the social contexts of the different \n\nnotes of the call through direct observations and playback experiments conducted in the field. \n\nDominant frequency correlated negatively with male body size, whereas long note duration \n\ncorrelated positively, and there was a weak correlation between pulse rate and male body size. \n\nAir temperature correlated negatively with long note duration and positively with pulse rate. \n\nPlayback experiments with males showed that that they did not change the proportion of long \n\nto short notes in the presence of an intruder (= playback), but rather they exhibited a graded \n\naggressive call, where short notes become longer, with lower dominant frequency and more \n\npulsated. We interpreted this call as an aggressive call. Our results suggest that dominant \n\nfrequency and long note duration might be under sexual selection by females, as they could \n\npotentially choose larger males with better territories relying on such parameters. On the other \n\nhand, pulse rate variation seems to be best explained by temperature. Short notes seem to be \n\nthe aggressive component of the mixed call, and the aggressive call is a variation of such \n\ncomponent. We also describe the fight call emitted by males engaged on a combat, each one \n\nemitting one type of note. This is the first description of a fight call for the genus \n\nBokermannohyla. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Bokermannohyla ibitiguara, Hylidae, sexual selection, fight call, calling \n\nbehavior. \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nSexual selection was defined as being the selection force acting differently in each sex \n\nor sexual function, due to the different strategies adopted by each sex, favoring reproductive \n\nsex-specific adaptations (Darwin, 1859, 1871; Carranza, 2009). It drives the ability of \n\nindividuals of one sex (generally males) in competing for mates (intra-sexual selection) and \n\nalso affects reproductive traits evaluated during mate choice (inter-sexual selection) (Krebs &amp; \n\nDavies, 1993). In anurans, some of these traits associated with \u201cbest\u201d quality males could be \n\nbody size, reproductive site fidelity, territory quality, and call properties, each one indicating \n\nstronger or healthier individuals (see Lips, 2005). \n\nStudies on male calling behavior in anurans is a good way to access sexual selection in \n\nthis group (e.g. Murphy, 1994; Gerhardt et al., 2000; Lea et al., 2000; Murphy &amp; Gerhardt, \n\n2002; Murphy, 2003; Giasson &amp; Haddad, 2007; Wogel &amp; Pombal-Jr, 2007). Most species \n\nemit more than one type of call, used in different social contexts (Duellman &amp; Trueb, 1994). \n\nIn general, male calls have two main purposes: to attract females (advertisement call) and to \n\nrepel other males (aggressive call). The advertisement call is considered a pre-zygotic \n\nisolating mechanism, preventing hybridization (Haddad et al., 1994). Aggressive call is part \n\nof the male\u2019s territorial behavior, which can also include chases and fights (Martins et al., \n\n1998). Despite these benefits, the emission of calls throughout the breeding season may \n\nimpose costs because of the higher energy expenditure and higher predation risk (Wells, \n\n2007). However, intraspecific call variation has been described, in which males emit different \n\nparts of the call in the presence of the predators or the females (e.g. Ryan, 1985). This may \n\nrepresent an adaptive behavior to solve the conflict between predation risks and reproductive \n\nsuccess. \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n \n\nIn general, the most commonly heard sound emitted by anuran males is the \n\nadvertisement call (Wells, 1977a), consequently it is also the most studied one (e.g. Ryan &amp; \n\nWilczynski, 1990; Martins &amp; Jim, 2003, 2004; Louren\u00e7o et al., 2010). For many species there \n\nis a negative correlation between male body size and call dominant frequency (e.g. Sullivan, \n\n1982; Howard &amp; Young, 1998; Giasson, 2003). Additionally, male success in obtaining mates \n\ncan be related to its larger body size (Lee &amp; Crump, 1981; Lee, 1986; Morris, 1989; Bastos &amp; \n\nHaddad, 1996; Bernard, 2007), probably because females are capable of choosing males \n\nevaluating their call properties (e.g. Howard &amp; Young, 1998; Lea et al., 2000; Murphy &amp; \n\nGerhardt, 2002; Gerhardt et al., 2007). In short, males\u2019 calling behavior is essential to \n\nelucidate sexual selection and territoriality in anurans. \n\nBesides direct observations in the field, playback experiments with frogs have been \n\nconducted either in the laboratory or in the field (Gerhardt et al. 2000; Murphy &amp; Gerhardt, \n\n2002; Gerhardt et al., 2007; Wogel &amp; Pombal-Jr, 2007). The advantages of lab-based \n\nexperiments are that one can effectively control for abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, rainfall, \n\nwind) and there is little or no noise interference, such as water sound or other conspecific or \n\nheterospecific males\u2019 vocalizations. However, any degree of captivity is disturbing and \n\nunnatural (Warwick, 1990), which certainly interferes in the animals\u2019 responses. Furthermore, \n\nwhen the aim of the study is the male vocal responses to playback, lab work is completely \n\nineffective, as males, in general, tend to stop calling when manipulated and kept in captivity \n\n(e.g. Taigen &amp; Wells, 1985). In this case, playback experiments in the field are recommended, \n\ndespite the lack of control for many variables and the difficulty in reaching the animals. (e.g. \n\nBee et al., 2000; L\u00fcddecke, 2002). \n\nBokermannohyla ibitiguara (Cardoso, 1983) is an endemic hylid frog from the \n\nBrazilian Cerrado. Despite being very common in its area of occurrence, its basic biology is \n\npoorly known (see Chapter 1). Males have a developed prepollex spine, establish territories \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n \n\nalong the stream, and engage in physical combats with other males (Chapter 1). According to \n\nthe original description, the advertisement call is composed by four to six primary long notes, \n\nfollowed by a sequence of about 10 secondary short notes (Cardoso, 1983). When two males \n\ncall next to each other, commonly one emits only long notes while the other one emits only \n\nshort notes (Cardoso, 1983). The occurrence of mixed call plus the fact that males can emit \n\ndifferent parts of the call depending on the social context, led us to hypothesize that long and \n\nshort notes should have different social functions. As B. ibitiguara males are territorial, we \n\ntested, through direct observation and playback experiments in the field, the hypothesis that \n\nthe first part of the call, with long notes, have the function of female attraction, while the \n\nsecond part, composed by short notes, have the function of aggressive call. We also checked \n\nif male body size and air temperature are correlated with acoustic characteristics of the call, \n\nand tested whether male response to playback is associated with male body size. Moreover, \n\nwe describe a fight call recorded during a male-male fight, which had never been previously \n\nreported for the genus Bokermannohyla. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nStudy area \n\nFieldwork was conducted in private farms in the municipality of Sacramento \n\n(19\u00b051\u2019S; 47\u00b026\u2019W), Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil. Three streams were sampled: (i) \n\npermanent stream 1 (20\u00ba16\u201921.9\u201dS; 47\u00ba04\u201924.5\u201dW; 677 m elevation); (ii) temporary stream \n\n(20\u00ba13\u201909.9\u201dS; 47\u00ba06\u201921\u201dW; 880 m elevation), and (iii) permanent stream 2 (20\u00ba12\u201920.1\u201dS; \n\n47\u00ba07\u201953.6\u201dW, 839 m elevation). \n\nThe study area is located at about 60 km from the Serra da Canastra National Park.The \n\nclimate is markedly seasonal, with a hot and rainy summer (October to March) and a dry \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n \n\nwinter (April to September), with total annual precipitation between 1300-1700 mm (Queirolo \n\nand Motta-Junior, 2007). The topography is mountainous, with flat or rounded hills, reaching \n\nup to 1500 m elevation, with deep valleys and many streams (Dietz, 1984). The landscape \n\nconsists of savannas, locally named as Cerrado vegetation, grassland fields at higher \n\nelevations, gallery forests in the valleys along streams, and patches of semideciduous forest \n\n(Dietz, 1984; Araujo et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nData collection \n\nObservations on male calling behavior occurred throughout the species\u2019 calling season \n\n(Oct \u2013 Jun). Individuals were located by search at breeding sites, guided by male calling \n\nactivity, and they were observed with headlamps. To reduce light interference on males\u2019 \n\nbehavior, red lights were used, as suggested for different nocturnal animals (e.g. Sazima &amp; \n\nPombal-Jr., 1986; Miranda et al., 2008; Mott &amp; Sparling, 2009). Whenever possible, we \n\navoided to point the light focus directly to the animals (Toledo, 2004). \n\n \n\nVocalization analyses, male body size and temperature \n\nCalls were recorded using a Marantz Professional PMD-660 digital recorder, with \n\nunidirectional microphone Sennheiser ME66 (19 cm/s speed), at a 16-bit resolution and \n\n44100 Hz sampling rate. Air temperature and time of recording were registered, as well as \n\nsocial context assumed as relevant. We described the fight call emitted by males during a \n\nmale-male fight. The analyses were performed using the software Raven Pro 1.3 (Cornell Lab \n\nof Ornithology). We mostly used the 512 points option (Fast Fourier Transformation, FFT), \n\nbrightness = 70, and contrast = 70. \n\nFor bioacoustic analyses and interpretations, we used the following terms (adapted \n\nfrom McLister et al., 1995; Martins &amp; Jim, 2003): \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n \n\n Call/vocalization: sequence of sounds produced and emitted in a temporal pattern; in \n\nthis species it consisted of more than one type of note (mixed or composite call). \n\n Note: the total amount of sound energy generated by the male during an air flow cycle, \n\nobserved through trunk and vocal sac inflation and deflation. \n\n Pulses: subdivision of the note in smaller temporal units; in this species, pulses are \n\ngenerally distributed in groups of pulses. \n\n Short pulses: pulses with extremely short durations (&lt;5 ms), not well-structured and \n\ndifficult to measure; in B. ibitiguara, such pulses are present in the short notes and \n\nsometimes at the very beginning of long notes. \n\nTo evaluate if parameters of males\u2019 advertisement call were influenced by male body \n\nsize and temperature (e.g. Howard &amp; Young, 1998; Toledo &amp; Haddad, 2005; Giasson &amp; \n\nHaddad, 2006), we performed linear regression analyses (Zar, 1999) between these variables \n\nand the call parameters. Advertisement call acoustic parameters evaluated were: (1) average \n\ndominant frequency (Hz) \u2013 about 5 long notes and 5 sequences of short notes of each male, \n\n(2) long note duration (s) \u2013 10 long notes for each male, and (3) pulse rate, counting the \n\nnumber of pulses and short pulses in 0.5 s from the onset of the 5 long notes for each male. \n\nWe chose these parameters because they are known to be preferred by females of anurans \n\n(Gerhardt, 1994). Snout-vent length (SVL) of males was measured in the field with an \n\nanalogic caliper (0.05 mm) and male mass was measured with a dynamometer (0.1 g). Males \n\nwere individualized through natural marks (spots, scars, etc.; Bradfield, 2004).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n \n \n\nSocial functions of notes: Direct observations and playback experiments \n\nDuring our study, we observed any male behavior that could yield conclusions about \n\nsocial functions of both parts of the advertisement call. We also recorded focal male calls in \n\nnatural conditions, checking if males emitted different parts of the call depending on the \n\nnumber of males attending the chorus and/or whether their calling activity was influenced by \n\nthe distance of the nearest calling neighbor (DNN). We expected that in larger choruses and at \n\nshort DNN, emission of short notes \u2013 assumed to have a territorial function \u2013 would increase. \n\nThus, we used Student\u2019s t-test to compare: (1) the average number of short notes emitted by \n\nmales calling alone or with another male and (2) the average number of short notes emitted by \n\nmales in groups of 3 to 5 individuals. ANOVA was used to compare the number of short \n\nnotes emitted in three different groups of DNN: 101 to 500 cm, 501 to 1000 cm and above \n\n1000 cm. We expected that males would emit more short notes in the group of 3 to 5 calling \n\nmales, and within the group of DNN from 101 to 500 cm. \n\nFor the playback construction, we used advertisement calls recorded from October to \n\nDecember 2010, from which we analyzed the following parameters: (1) average dominant \n\nfrequency (Hz), (2) average duration of long notes (s), (3) average duration of the short notes\u2019 \n\nsequences (s), (4) average time interval between notes (s), and (5) average number of long \n\nnotes emitted between short notes\u2019 sequences. For parameters 1, 2 and 3, we analyzed about 5 \n\nnotes and 5 sequences of short notes for each individual (N = 15 males); for number 4, we \n\nanalyzed 15 intervals for each individual (N = 5 males) and for number 5 we also used the \n\nlatter individuals (N = 32 sections). After determining mean values for each parameter (table \n\n1), we chose, from our recordings, specific notes that showed the closest values from these \n\naverages. We then constructed playbacks of 1 minute each, according to each treatment, using \n\nthe free software Audacity 1.3 Beta. \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 1.

For each test, we used a \n\nmini system Philips AZ-302S with an audio CR-ROM, containing the constructed playback in \n\noriginal WAV format, adjusting the volume to emit the same SPL at 50 cm, thus simulating at \n\nmost the natural condition of male\u2019s call (e.g. Rosso et al., 2006). Although the ideal \n\ncondition for playback experiments is to use potent amplifiers and fixed speakers (e.g. \n\nGerhardt et al. 2000; Murphy &amp; Gerhardt, 2002), such thing is difficult to do with this species \n\nin the field, because individuals are commonly found perched on the vegetation and inside the \n\ngallery forests (Chapter 1). Nonetheless, our speakers were good enough to evaluate males\u2019 \n\nresponses. \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe playback experimental procedure was as follows: the sound source was held at \n\nabout 50 cm from the male, recording male\u2019s call without playback (control treatment; 1 \n\nminute). After that, we began the test period, playing the playback for 1 minute and recording \n\nmale\u2019s response during this minute (Giasson, 2003). This procedure was performed for three \n\ndifferent treatments, each one with its own playback track: T1) a call with only long notes, \n\nT2) a call with only sequences of short notes, and T3) a mixed call, similar to the common \n\nadvertisement call, with both long and short notes. For both control and test periods we \n\ncounted the number of short and long notes emitted by the male. Each individual was tested \n\nonly once per treatment (N = 41 males); in a few cases, two tests using the same male \n\noccurred, but those were separated by at least a period of non-calling activity (e.g. Luna et al. \n\n2010). We managed to do 16 replicas for T1, 16 for T2, and 17 for T3. However, as many \n\nmales practically stopped calling during the playback \u2013 which was assumed as lack of \n\nresponse \u2013 we were able to consider 7 replicas for T1, 13 replicas for T2, and 11 replicas for \n\nT3. \n\nDifferences in the mean number of short and long notes before and during the \n\nplayback were tested using a t-test for dependent samples (Zar, 1999). We assumed that, if \n\nshort notes had the function of agressive call, the number of short notes should increase when \n\nsimulating an intruder, i. e., during the playback; similarly, if long notes had the main \n\nfunction of female attraction, the number of long notes should decrease. \n\nSince we had a number of replicas without male response to the playbacks, we \n\ninvestigated whether males of the non-responding group were significantly smaller than males \n\nthat responded to the playbacks. Mean SVL and body mass of responding and non-responding \n\nmales were compared through a Student t-test (Zar, 1999). All data set was checked for \n\nnormality with Shapiro-Wilk test. Tests were considered statistically significant when p &lt;\n\n0.05. All analyses were performed in the program Statistica v.10 (Statsoft). \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n \n \n\nRESULTS \n\n \n\nAdvertisement call properties, body size, and temperature \n\nAlthough the call of B. ibitiguara has already been described in the original \n\ndescription of the species (Cardoso, 1983), table 1 shows complementary measures of the \n\nadvertisement call. Dominant frequency of calls were negatively correlated with both male \n\nbody mass (R\u00b2 = 0.65; N = 49; p &lt;0.001; figure 1A) and male SVL (R\u00b2 = 0.74; N=49; p &lt;\n\n0.001; figure 1B). As expected, larger and heavier males showed calls with lower dominant \n\nfrequency, whereas smaller and lighter males showed calls with higher dominant frequency. \n\nLong note duration (s) correlated positively with male body mass (R\u00b2 = 0.55; N = 40; p &lt;\n\n0.001; figure 1C) and at a marginally significant level with male SVL (R\u00b2 = 0.51; N = 40; p = \n\n0.052; figure 1D): larger and heavier males emitted longer notes. Although the correlations \n\nbetween male body mass and SVL versus pulse rate were statistically significant (p &lt;0.05), \n\nthey were very weak (R\u00b2 = 0.03 and R\u00b2 = 0.006, respectively). Long note duration (s) \n\ncorrelated negatively with air temperature (\u00baC) (R\u00b2 = 0.24; N = 40; p &lt;0.001; figure 2A), \n\nwhereas pulse rate showed a positive correlation (R\u00b2 = 0.13; N =38; p &lt;0.001; figure 2B). \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

During the peaks of \n\ncalling activity, males never emitted only short notes; this only happened during periods of \n\nlow calling activity, when males emitted mostly sequences of short notes but at a low \n\nrepetition rate.  \n\nOn 21 January, 2010, we observed two males approximately 60 cm of distance \n\nbetween each other, and there was a female nearby, which was noticed by the males. In this \n\ncase, both males emitted mostly long notes, in antiphony. On 25 January, 2011, we observed a \n\ncalling male, a satellite male, and a female nearby. In this case, the calling male also emitted \n\nmostly long notes. \n\n On 20 November, 2010, we observed two males, with no females nearby. Both males \n\nemitted mostly short notes and few long notes. In two occasions, we observed a calling male \n\nturning to a satellite male and emitting short notes toward him; after that, the calling male \n\nturned around and restarted the emission of mixed calls. There was a female nearby in one of \n\nthese occasions.  On 18 January, 2011, before engaging on a fight, a resident male emitted \n\nshort notes towards the satellite male. Also, when satellite male started to call, both males \n\nemitted short notes, although long notes were still present. \n\nThe number of short notes emitted by individuals alone or with another calling male \n\nwas not different from those emitted by males in groups of 3 to 5 individuals (t = -0.54; p = \n\n0.59). Also, there was no difference in short notes\u2019 emission among any of the groups of \n\nDNN (F = 1.31, p = 0.29). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \n \n\nPlayback experiments and aggressive call \n\n During the playback, nearly all males would instantaneously turn around to face the \n\nsound source. This happened even in cases of total lack of response (N = 18). Some \n\nabandoned the calling site after a while (N = 3), and some interacted not aggressively, but \n\nrather in antiphony (N = 5). Males responded better to calls from T1 (long notes) and T3 \n\n(mixed notes), but after T2 (only short notes) they were often inhibited (N = 9). This behavior \n\nwas conspicuous because, even when they remained calling, the call was usually less intense \n\nand at a lower repetition rate.  \n\nThere was no difference in average SVL (mm) between males that responded and \n\nmales that did not respond to T1 (t = 1.72; p = 0.12), T2 (t = -0.09; p = 0.93) and T3 (t = 0.02; \n\np = 0.98). Considering average male body mass (g), there was no difference for T2 (t = 0.28; \n\np = 0.78) and T3 (t = 0.11; p = 0.91), but for T1, responding males were significantly heavier \n\nthan non-responding ones (t = 2.22; p &lt;0.05). Considering the treatments all-together, there \n\nwas no difference neither in SVL (t = 0.32; p = 0.75) nor in mass (t = 0.61; p = 0.55) between \n\nresponding and non-responding males. \n\n Inside each treatment, there was no difference between the number of short and long \n\nnotes emitted before and during the playback, except for T3 (normal advertisement call), in \n\nwhich males significantly reduced the emission of long notes during the playback (t = 3.75, p \n\n&lt;0.05). Moreover, on average, males tended to emit less long notes and more short notes \n\nduring T1 and T3 playback experiments, whereas during the T2 playback males emitted more \n\nlong notes and practically maintained the number of short notes (figure 3). \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

Gray bars are long notes and white bars are short notes (see text for details). \n\n \n\nWe observed that dominant frequency and note duration of the short notes emitted in \n\nresponse to the playbacks were slightly different from that of the short notes emitted in the \n\ncommon mixed advertisement call before the playback, but the number of short notes per \n\nsequence was similar (table 2; figure 4). We propose that the call emitted during the playback \n\nis the aggressive call itself, which was heard sometimes in natural conditions without \n\nplayback. The short notes commonly emitted in the mixed advertisement call could be \n\nconsidered as an aggressive component of the mixed call (see discussion). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 2.

Although the recording presents water noise on \n\nthe background, we were able to recognize two types of notes, A and B, each one emitted by \n\none of the males (figure 5). Note A is to some extent similar to a common long note, but note \n\nB is different from any other notes previously described for this species. Note B shows two \n\nwell-defined harmonics, and possibly a third harmonic after the middle of the note (figure 5). \n\nIt was possible to individualize four notes A and four notes B in a segment of 10 seconds, \n\nwhich were used here to measure and describe the call (table 3).  \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

We found that the mean interval between \n\nnotes was 0.64 s (table 1), while in the original description it was 0.15 s (Cardoso, 1983). \n\nCardoso (1983) stated that the pulses are similar for all the notes, but we observed that the \n\npulses of the short notes are shorter and more difficult to measure than the pulses of the long \n\nnotes. We also observed that the number of long notes between the sequences of short notes \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n \n\nvaried from 1 to 17, while Cardoso (1983) described a variation between 4 and 6. Herein, the \n\nnumber of pulses for long notes in a 0.5 s interval varied from 10 to 41 (see figure 2B), while \n\nin the original description the variation is from 15 to 18 pulses for the entire note. These \n\ndifferences could be explained by the smaller sample size in the original description, although \n\nthis information is not clear there (Cardoso, 1983). On the other hand, in the original \n\ndescription the dominant frequency ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 kHz (Cardoso, 1983), which is \n\nsimilar to our results (1.4 \u2013 2.3 kHz). Such slight differences in characteristics of the calls are \n\ncommonly observed between populations of the same species (e.g. Snyder &amp; Jameson, 1965; \n\nRyan &amp; Rand, 2003). Furthermore, it is important to mention that our results and Cardoso\u2019s \n\nresults are separated by almost 30 years of bioacoustic analyses improvement. \n\nDominant frequency of B. ibitiguara calls was strongly correlated to male body size: \n\nas expected, larger and heavier males exhibited calls with lower frequency, whereas smaller \n\nand lighter males exhibited calls with higher frequency (e.g. Guimar\u00e3es &amp; Bastos, 2003; \n\nToledo, 2004; Giasson &amp; Haddad, 2006). Although this correlation is originated because of \n\nthe difference in laryngeal components of individuals of different sizes (Martin, 1972), it may \n\nalso indicate that this spectral trait of male call might be under sexual selection. It is possible \n\nthat females of B. ibitiguara select males through the evaluation of the call frequency, as \n\npreviously reported for other anurans (Ryan, 1980; Ryan et al., 1992; M\u00e1rquez &amp; Bosch, \n\n1997). Females might have an advantage in choosing larger males, i.e., males with lower \n\ndominant frequencies, because since this species is territorial (Chapter 1), larger males are \n\nlikely to monopolize better-quality territories for oviposition. \n\nLong note duration was also correlated with male body size, a trait that may also be \n\nunder sexual selection pressure (e.g. Klump &amp; Gerhardt, 1987; Gerhardt, 1994). However, in \n\nthe present study, this trait was explained by air temperature as well: at higher temperatures, \n\nmales emitted shorter calls. Thus, the evaluation of this call trait by females will depend on \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe current air temperature. Pulse rate correlated very weakly with male body size (R\u00b2 &lt;0.05), \n\nbut more strongly with air temperature (R\u00b2 = 0.13), which indicates that this trait might be \n\nmore influenced by abiotic factors, but other abiotic variables should be investigated. The \n\nevolution of anuran call properties and female choice is very complex, given that calls are \n\ncomposed by a set of characters, which evolve at different rates (Cocroft &amp; Ryan, 1995). \n\nStudies on male choice by B. ibitiguara females are needed to elucidate the role of call \n\nproperties on the sexual selection mechanism in this species.  \n\nBokermannohyla ibitiguara males exhibit a mixed call and our results indicate that one \n\npart of the call may be directed to females (advertisement) and another part directed to males \n\n(aggressive). The mixed call is advantageous to males because they can share the functions of \n\nfemale attraction and male aggressiveness, lowering energetic costs related to aggressive \n\ncalls\u2019 emission (Wells, 1988; Lingnau et al., 2004). These calls may be less attractive to \n\nfemales (Wells, 1988; Lingnau et al., 2004), but the aggressive part seems to be important, as \n\nmale territoriality in frogs is often related to higher reproductive success (e.g. Wells, 1977b; \n\nUrsprung et al., 2011). In B. ibitiguara, the long notes might constitute the advertisement part, \n\nas we observed in two occasions males emitting these notes with a female nearby. However, \n\nplayback experiments with females are needed to confirm such assumption, as well as female \n\npreferences in general, which was not possible to conduct here because receptive females \n\nwere very hard to find in the field during our study (Chapter 1). \n\nConsidering the short notes, we found that males can emit two types: one in natural \n\nconditions, and the other when simulating an intruder (e.g. playback). The latter call was \n\nsometimes also heard in natural conditions. These calls are similar, since the number of short \n\nnotes emitted per sequence was not statistically different. However, they exhibited important \n\ndifferences; the call emitted during the playback had lower dominant frequency, was longer \n\nand presented groups of structured pulses. Based on these results, we suggest that the short \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \n \n\nnotes of the mixed advertisement call may have territorial function, and the aggressive call \n\nitself, emitted when there is an intruder (during the playback), is a variation of the short notes. \n\nIf short notes have indeed a territorial function, why did not our playback experiments \n\nconfirm such assumption? Males did not statistically reduce the emission of long notes, \n\nexcept for the T3 treatment, and did not increase the emission of short aggressive notes during \n\nthe playbacks. Since we discovered a variation in the short notes, one possible explanation is \n\nthat the aggressiveness of B. ibitiguara aggressive call is not related to the number of short \n\nnotes emitted (e.g. Giasson &amp; Haddad, 2006), but rather in the modulation of some \n\nparameters of the original short note. During the playbacks, short notes became longer, with \n\nlower dominant frequency, and exhibited more pulses and short pulses, a very much similar \n\npattern to the African painted reed frog, Hyperolius marmoratus (Grafe, 1995). In Pseudacris \n\ncrucifer, a North American hylid, for example, males increased aggressive call duration and \n\nthe number of aggressive calls in response to increases in stimulus intensity (i.e. synthetic \n\ncalls; Schwartz, 1989). Although the number of aggressive calls (short notes) in B. ibitiguara \n\nremained the same, aggressive notes were longer, which clearly shows energy investment of \n\nthe male. Furthermore, the dominant frequency of the short notes emitted during the \n\nplaybacks was significantly lower than that of the normal short notes. It is known that males \n\nmay lower the dominant frequency when interacting vocally with nearby males (Wagner, \n\n1989; Howard &amp; Young, 1998; Bee et al., 2000), increasing its apparent fight ability and \n\navoiding fights (see below). At last, the groups of pulses in the aggressive call were audibly \n\nmore aggressive than the single group of short pulses from the original short notes of the \n\nmixed calls. Thus, it is possible that B. ibitiguara might show graded aggressive calls (sensu \n\nWells, 1988; Martins et al., 1998), in which males may vary the aggressive and advertisement \n\nelements as males gradually approach. In this case, males can vary the aggressive element in \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n \n \n\nterms of dominant frequency, duration, and pulse structure of the short notes when there is an \n\nintruder nearby. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that our replication with actual male response for each \n\ntreatment was not high; maybe males do emit more short notes and less long notes in the \n\npresence of a real intruder. Since the males would instantaneously turn around to become \n\n\u201cface to face\u201d with the \u201cintruder\u201d (the sound source) during the playback, the visual \n\ncomponent in territorial interactions might be important for this species. In some frog species, \n\nstereotyped behaviors, such as foot flagging, leg kicking, and body raising, are known to have \n\naggressive function towards other males (e.g. Am\u00e9zquita &amp; H\u00f6dl, 2004; Giasson &amp; Haddad, \n\n2006; Preininger et al., 2009). We did not see any aggressive visual signal in this species \n\nduring our direct observations, but they might have existed when running the playback, which \n\nwe could not see because we turned off all the lights to avoid any interference. We did not use \n\ndummy frogs either, which could elicit different male responses (e.g. Luna et al., 2010). \n\nFuture studies might focus on such aspects. \n\nMales of B. ibitiguara emitted the same number of short notes regardless of the \n\ndistance of the nearest neighbor and the number of males attending the chorus, which means \n\nthat short notes are always present. These short notes were mostly the common short notes of \n\nthe mixed call. As already observed (Chapter 1), males of B. ibitiguara tended to occur \n\nsparsely along the streams, establishing territories. Since fights are costly (Robertson, 1986; \n\nMartins &amp; Haddad, 1988), physical combat is strongly avoided and disputes of males are \n\ngenerally resolved with signalizations (Robertson, 1986), which have been suggested as a way \n\nto evaluate each other\u2019s ability to fight without actually fighting (Parker, 1974). It seems to be \n\ntrue for B. ibitiguara, since we observed male-male fight only once during all field work \n\n(Chapter 1), and such fight only ocurred because the satellite male accompanied the entire \n\ncalling male\u2019s courtship sequence and tried to steal the territory (Chapter 1). The conventional \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n \n \n\nterritorial signalization for this species is probably the aggressive part of the call (short notes), \n\nwhich might function as a constant signal that the male is willing to defend its territory if \n\nnecessary. \n\nSince males of B. ibitiguara tend to avoid fights, the capacity of B. ibitiguara to lower \n\nthe dominant frequency of their aggressive calls in the presence of an intruder might be \n\nexplained by the \u201cbluff of size\u201d hypothesis (Wagner, 1992): the signal sent to the opponent is \n\ndeceptive, and by doing so, males seem larger than they actually are. The assessment of the \n\nopponent characteristics related to fight ability, such as male size, is an important part of the \n\ndecision whether or not to engage on a fight, which fits the concept of the Game Theory \n\n(Myerson, 1991), a widespread concept used to explain conflicts between individuals. Also, \n\nthe strategy of engaging on fights only in the last case can also be seen as an Evolutionary \n\nStable Strategy (ESS; Maynard-Smith &amp; Price, 1973), since B. ibitiguara males tend to \n\nexhibit this sequence of behaviors to prevent any unnecessary injuries, which might be \n\nadaptative. If all males are capable of behaving this way, it is probable that a mutant strategy \n\nwill not succeed, as assumed by the EES theory. \n\nWe expected that smaller males would be more inhibited by the presence of an \n\nintruder (playbacks) than larger males, first because those are generally less likely to win male \n\ncombats (Wells, 1978; Shine, 1989; Katsikaros &amp; Shine 1997) and second because the winner \n\nof the fight observed for B. ibitiguara was indeed heavier and larger (Chapter 1). Still, body \n\nsize of B. ibitiguara males did not interfere with male\u2019s response to playback, except for body \n\nweight in T1. Although one could hyphotesize that males are not able to recognize intruder\u2019s \n\nsize through its call properties, this is probably not true, as males lowered the dominant \n\nfrequency of their calls when exposed to an intruder (see discussion above). Moreover, by \n\nlowering the dominant frequency of their aggressive calls, even smaller males may increase \n\ntheir apparent fight ability, having the chance to defend their territories without actually \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \n \n\nfighting. Therefore, the lack of response to playbacks might be related with other factors, such \n\nas male condition, degree of male activity, social context, or even by the presence of the \n\nobserver and artificial reproduction of the calls during the playback experiments. \n\nFight calls are common during male agonistic interactions in frogs, but this is the first \n\ndescription of this type of call for the genus Bokermannohyla. The two types of notes \n\nrecorded during the fight between B. ibitiguara males had lower dominant frequencies than \n\nthe advertisement call, as observed in Centrolene lynchi fight call (Dautel et al., 2011). \n\nHowever, in the latter case, only one of the males emitted the fight call, whereas in B. \n\nibitiguara calls were emitted by both males. Other hylids in which both males emitted fight \n\ncalls during the combat are Hypsiboas faber (Martins &amp; Haddad, 1988), Scinax \n\nfuscomarginatus (Toledo &amp; Haddad, 2005), Dendropsophus elegans (Bastos &amp; Haddad, \n\n1995), and Scinax rizibilis (Bastos &amp; Haddad, 2002). Hypsiboas faber emitted two types of \n\nnotes, similarly to B. ibitiguara, but S. fuscomarginatus emitted only one type. Like B. \n\nibitiguara, males of S. fuscomarginatus and S. rizibilis emitted fight call notes at irregular \n\nintervals, while in H. faber such notes were emitted in an alternated way by the males. \n\nBrasileiro (1998) described a fight call for Physalaemus centralis, which has a similar \n\nstructure compared to that of B. ibitiguara, with each type of note emitted by one male, one \n\nnote similar to the advertisement call and the other very different. However, this fight call was \n\nnot emitted when males were fighting, but rather when they were very close to each other (15 \n\ncm; Brasileiro, 1998). \n\nOur study revealed that B. ibitiguara vocal repertoire is much more complex and \n\nfurther studies on calling behavior, call properties, and sexual selection are needed. However, \n\nthis study provides important data on the species\u2019 vocal behavior, which we expect will \n\ncontribute and encourage future studies trying to understand the mechanisms of mate \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n \n \n\nselection and male-male social interactions in this hylid frog endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado \n\nand included in category of Data Deficient (Caramaschi and Eterovick, 2004). \n\n  \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAM\u00c9ZQUITA, A.; H\u00d6DL, W.

Quando \n\nempoleirados, machos ficaram a uma altura m\u00e9dia de 1,13 \u00b1 0,89 m acima da \u00e1gua ou 0,99 \u00b1 \n\n0,74 m acima do solo, neste caso distantes horizontalmente 0,67 \u00b1 0,64 m em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 \u00e1gua. \n\n Esta esp\u00e9cie n\u00e3o apresentou dimorfismo sexual em tamanho quanto ao comprimento rostro-\n\ncloacal (CRC), por\u00e9m f\u00eameas sem ovos foram significativamente mais leves do que machos, \n\nprovavelmente pelo fato de o investimento reprodutivo das f\u00eameas (20,26%) ser bem mais \n\nalto do que o dos machos (0,29%). \n\n F\u00eameas gr\u00e1vidas continham uma m\u00e9dia de 202 \u00b1 75 ov\u00f3citos, com di\u00e2metro m\u00e9dio de 1,96 \u00b1 \n\n0,16. Os ov\u00f3citos apresentam polo animal preto e polo vegetativo bege. A partir da massa das \n\ng\u00f4nadas ovadas, a massa da desova foi estimada em 0,97 \u00b1 0,36 g.  \n\n Em f\u00eameas gr\u00e1vidas, houve uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o positiva entre massa corp\u00f3rea e massa do ov\u00e1rio. \n\nPor\u00e9m, n\u00e3o houve rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre CRC da f\u00eamea e n\u00famero de ov\u00f3citos. Isso pode estar \n\nrelacionado com a varia\u00e7\u00e3o individual do di\u00e2metro dos ov\u00f3citos, apesar de n\u00e3o ter sido \n\nobservado um trade-off entre n\u00famero de ov\u00f3citos e di\u00e2metro dos mesmos. \n\n A corte nesta esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 complexa, apresentando al\u00e9m dos est\u00edmulos ac\u00fasticos, uma ou duas \n\ninvestidas do macho na f\u00eamea, semelhante a um tapa, o que parece ser importante para o \n\nprocesso de condu\u00e7\u00e3o da f\u00eamea at\u00e9 o s\u00edtio de oviposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Os dois s\u00edtios observados foram \n\nlocais escondidos, e em pelo menos um deles foi observada inspe\u00e7\u00e3o da f\u00eamea. O modo \n\nreprodutivo da esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o do modo reprodutivo 4, caracter\u00edstico do g\u00eanero, com \n\novos e est\u00e1gios larvais iniciais em bacias naturais ou constru\u00eddas em riachos.  \n\n O comportamento de macho sat\u00e9lite foi comum nesta esp\u00e9cie, sendo que um mesmo macho \n\npode alternar entre sat\u00e9lite e vocalizador. Machos sat\u00e9lites ficaram a uma dist\u00e2ncia m\u00e9dia de \n\n0,54 \u00b1 0,29 m dos machos vocalizadores. Machos sat\u00e9lites e vocalizadores n\u00e3o apresentaram \n\ndiferen\u00e7as quanto ao CRC e massa corporal. \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n \n \n\n Machos vocalizadores tendem a se distribuir esparsamente ao longo dos corpos d\u2019\u00e1gua, \n\npossivelmente evitando conflitos. Entretanto, os machos s\u00e3o territoriais, e foi observado um \n\ncombate f\u00edsico, cada um investindo seu espinho do pr\u00e9-p\u00f3lex, principalmente na regi\u00e3o dos \n\nolhos e t\u00edmpanos do oponente; o canto de briga foi gravado e descrito, com duas notas \n\ndistintas, cada qual emitida por um indiv\u00edduo, de forma temporalmente irregular. \n\n O canto da esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 considerado misto, onde h\u00e1 uma parte direcionada \u00e0s f\u00eameas \n\n(componente de an\u00fancio) e outra aos machos (componente agressivo). Nossos resultados \n\nsugerem que o componente de an\u00fancio s\u00e3o as notas longas, enquanto o agressivo, as notas \n\ncurtas, emitidas em sequ\u00eancias. Este componente agressivo est\u00e1 sempre presente, \n\nindependentemente do n\u00famero de indiv\u00edduos no coro ou a dist\u00e2ncia do vizinho mais pr\u00f3ximo. \n\n Machos maiores tendem a apresentar cantos com frequ\u00eancias mais baixas e notas mais longas. \n\nEm contrapartida, um aumento na temperatura do ar significou uma emiss\u00e3o de notas mais \n\ncurtas, mas com uma taxa de pulsos maior. A taxa de pulsos apresentou uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o muito \n\nfraca com o tamanho corp\u00f3reo do macho. Esta combina\u00e7\u00e3o de fatores demonstra que a \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o da comunica\u00e7\u00e3o em B. ibitiguara \u00e9 complexa, dependendo tanto de fatores \n\npossivelmente selecionados pela f\u00eamea quanto de fatores abi\u00f3ticos, como a temperatura. \n\n Os experimentos de playback mostraram que o canto agressivo de B. ibitiguara \u00e9 uma \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o do componente agressivo do canto misto, pois \u00e9 mantido o mesmo n\u00famero de notas \n\npor sequ\u00eancia, mas modificam-se alguns par\u00e2metros ac\u00fasticos: a frequ\u00eancia dominante \n\ndecresce, a nota se torna mais longa e mais pulsada, com grupos de pulsos e pulsos curtos. \n\n A capacidade de o macho emitir um canto agressivo com uma frequ\u00eancia mais baixa deve \n\nestar relacionada com um aumento da habilidade de luta aparente, j\u00e1 que isso indicaria um \n\nmacho maior e mais prov\u00e1vel de vencer combates e manter o territ\u00f3rio. Isto explica porque a \n\nresposta dos machos ao playback n\u00e3o dependeu do tamanho dos mesmos, j\u00e1 que atrav\u00e9s do \n\ncanto agressivo os machos menores conseguem parecer maiores. \n\n Sendo esta esp\u00e9cie end\u00eamica do Cerrado, provavelmente a savana mais amea\u00e7ada do mundo, \n\ne tamb\u00e9m fortemente associada com matas de galeria, acreditamos que nossos resultados de \n\naspectos b\u00e1sicos e aplicados da hist\u00f3ria natural podem ser \u00fateis em a\u00e7\u00f5es conservacionistas, \n\nal\u00e9m de encorajar futuros estudos com esta e outras esp\u00e9cies brasileiras.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\tCAPA\n\tFOLHA DE ROSTO\n\tFICHA CATALOGR\u00c1FICA\n\tCOMISS\u00c3O EXAMINADORA\n\tAGRADECIMENTOS\n\tEP\u00cdGRAFE\n\tSUM\u00c1RIO\n\tRESUMO\n\tABSTRACT\n\tINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O\n\tREFER\u00caNCIAS\n\tCAP\u00cdTULO I - HABITAT USE, REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN A STREAM-DWELLER TREEFROG OF THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO\n\tCAP\u00cdTULO II - CALL PROPERTIES, PLAYBACK EXPERIMENTS, AND FIGHT CALL IN A GLADIATOR TREEFROG ENDEMIC TO THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO\n\tCONCLUS\u00d5ES"}]}}}
