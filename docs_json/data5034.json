Com o crescimento das novas pot\u00eancias econ\u00f3micas as previs\u00f5es apontam para que esta tend\u00eancia se acentue, aumentando at\u00e9 51 % entre 2010 e 2035. A combust\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo e dos seus derivados \u00e9 a principal fonte de energia a n\u00edvel mundial, representando 34% do total, por isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 de admirar que no mesmo per\u00edodo as previs\u00f5es apontem para que tamb\u00e9m se verifique um aumento tanto no consumo (~20%) como na produ\u00e7\u00e3o do petr\u00f3leo (~7%) (OPEC, 2011). No entanto, \u00e9 um facto conhecido que o petr\u00f3leo, como os restantes combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis, \u00e9 uma fonte de energia n\u00e3o renov\u00e1vel, e ao ritmo a que est\u00e1 a ser consumido as suas reservas dever\u00e3o durar pouco mais de 80 anos (OPEC, 2011). Visto que num futuro pr\u00f3ximo os biocombust\u00edveis n\u00e3o parecem vir a ser um substituto v\u00e1lido para os combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis (Achten et al., 2008, Stephen et al., 2010), as empresas petrol\u00edferas est\u00e3o obrigadas a procurar alternativas, nomeadamente atrav\u00e9s da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de crudes mais pesados. Estes crudes, que anteriormente eram descartados, s\u00e3o caracterizados por uma maior viscosidade e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de compostos indesejados, como metais pesados ou compostos de enxofre. Uma vez que as reservas em crudes pesados representam mais do dobro relativamente \u00e0s reservas convencionais (Javadli and Klerk, 2012), as empresas petrol\u00edferas v\u00eam-nos como uma poss\u00edvel op\u00e7\u00e3o a m\u00e9dio-longo prazo para a ind\u00fastria petrol\u00edfera.\nDurante a combust\u00e3o do petr\u00f3leo e dos seus derivados libertam-se para a atmosfera uma grande variedade de subst\u00e2ncias poluentes, entre as quais se destacam os compostos de enxofre, como \u00f3xidos de enxofre, por exemplo o SO2, e metal-sulfatos sob a forma de part\u00edculas de pequenas dimens\u00f5es. Estes compostos s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis por muitos problemas: o SO2 quando em elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es provoca irrita\u00e7\u00e3o bronquial e desencadeia ataques de asma. Alem disso, a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o prolongada \u00e0s part\u00edculas de enxofre representa um factor de risco importante associado \u00e0 mortalidade por doen\u00e7as cardiopulmonares ou por cancro do pulm\u00e3o (Pope et al., 2002; Mohebali et al., 2008). Por outro lado a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o dos compostos de enxofre na atmosfera leva \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de um aerossol de \u00e1cido sulf\u00farico, que contribui para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de chuvas \u00e1cidas (Bender and Weigel, 2011) e para o alargamento do buraco na camada de ozono (Denis, 2010)\nAssim, e uma vez que, no seu conjunto, a gasolina, o gas\u00f3leo e outros combust\u00edveis representam 75 a 80 % dos produtos das refinarias (Babich and Moulijn, 2003), o mundo tem visto na regula\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus teores de enxofre uma maneira eficaz de controlar as suas emiss\u00f5es e limitar os seus efeitos adversos (Mohebali and Ball, 2008). Em v\u00e1rios pa\u00edses tem-se assistido ao surgimento de limites legais cada vez mais restritos, reduzindo as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de enxofre nos combust\u00edveis. Nos Estados Unidos da Am\u00e9rica, por exemplo, verificou-se a redu\u00e7\u00e3o do limite m\u00e1ximo de 3400 ppm em 2003 para 30 ppm em 2010 para todos os combust\u00edveis refinados, com limites mais apertados para a gasolina e o gas\u00f3leo. Na Uni\u00e3o Europeia, desde 2009, tamb\u00e9m se tem verificado uma restri\u00e7\u00e3o na legisla\u00e7\u00e3o, com o estabelecimento de um limite m\u00e1ximo de 10 ppm de enxofre para a gasolina e o gas\u00f3leo (OPEC, 2011).\nPara responder a este problema e remover de forma eficaz o enxofre contido no petr\u00f3leo, nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas t\u00eam sido desenvolvidas v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas. Entre elas, aquela que \u00e9 mais conhecida e amplamente\nusada pela ind\u00fastria petrol\u00edfera \u00e9 a hidrodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o (HDS). Este \u00e9 um processo catal\u00edtico que, resumidamente, se caracteriza por conjugar press\u00f5es e temperaturas elevadas (entre 150 a 3000 psi e 290 e 455 \u00b0C respectivamente), na presen\u00e7a de catalisadores met\u00e1licos, para fazer reagir hidrog\u00e9nio gasoso com o enxofre contido no petr\u00f3leo e assim formar g\u00e1s sulf\u00eddrico (H2S) que \u00e9 facilmente removido (Nikkolaj et al., 2000; Whitehurst et al., 1998; Shafi and Hutchings, 2000; Javadli and Klerk, 2012). Esta t\u00e9cnica apresenta no entanto uma grande limita\u00e7\u00e3o: n\u00e3o \u00e9 eficaz na remo\u00e7\u00e3o do enxofre presente nos compostos arom\u00e1ticos mais complexos, como os derivados do dibenzotiofeno (DBT), muito abundantes nos crudes mais pesados. Estes compostos apresentam uma estrutura molecular que protege o \u00e1tomo de enxofre e dificulta a reac\u00e7\u00e3o com o hidrog\u00e9nio, tornando-se numa grande barreira \u00e0 obten\u00e7\u00e3o de combust\u00edveis com os n\u00edveis de enxofre exigidos por lei a partir dos crudes pesados (Grossman et al., 2001; Javadli and Klerk, 2012; Chen et al., 2009; Monticello, 2000; Onaka etal., 2001).\nPara dessulfurizar esses compostos, a ind\u00fastria recorre ao agravamento das condi\u00e7\u00f5es usadas anteriormente (HDS profunda), aplicando o tratamento por mais tempo, a press\u00f5es e temperaturas superiores (Reichmuth et al., 2000), com novos e mais complexos catalisadores (Klein et al., 1999; Dolbear and Skov, 2000; Abotsi and Scaroni, 1989). No entanto, com o intensificar de condi\u00e7\u00f5es, surgiram v\u00e1rios problemas, como o aumento dos custos da dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o (Grossman et al., 2001, McFarland, 1999), o aumento da polui\u00e7\u00e3o (Singh et al., 2012) e ainda, em casos mais extremos, uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade do combust\u00edvel, que devido \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es demasiado restringentes sofre uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o no n\u00famero de octanas (Reichmuth et al., 2000; Javadli and Klerk, 2012; Dolbear and Skov, 2000).\nEstes problemas levaram a que surgisse a necessidade de desenvolver t\u00e9cnicas alternativas ou complementares para remo\u00e7\u00e3o do enxofre. Uma delas \u00e9 a biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o (BDS), que se caracteriza por permitir, atrav\u00e9s da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de microrganismos, alcan\u00e7ar a dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos compostos mais recalcitrantes \u00e0 HDS, sem a necessidade de press\u00f5es ou temperaturas elevadas, nem de hidrog\u00e9nio ou catalisadores met\u00e1licos (Reichmuth et al., 2000, Mohebali and Ball, 2008; Caro et al., 2007). Isto torna todo o processo mais f\u00e1cil, com menor impacto ambiental e mais barato, com alguns estudos a indicar uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o do capital inicial para metade e uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de 15 % dos custos operacionais (Pacheco et al., 1999; Linguist and Pacheco 1999; Kaufman et al., 1998)\nNos estudos de BDS o composto mais usado \u00e9 o DBT (Bressler and Fedorak, 2001) por ser abundante nos crudes, ser dif\u00edcil de dessulfurizar pelos m\u00e9todos normais (Borgne and Quintero, 2003) e por ser relativamente f\u00e1cil de manipular (Kropp and Fedorak, 1998; Alves, 2007).\nA biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o pode ocorrer atrav\u00e9s de vias anaer\u00f3bicas ou aer\u00f3bicas. No entanto, a que apresenta maior potencial \u00e9 uma via aer\u00f3bica designada 4S. Esta via caracteriza-se por promover a remo\u00e7\u00e3o do enxofre do DBT atrav\u00e9s de uma s\u00e9rie de processos oxidativos, convertendo-o em 2-hidroxibifenil (2-HBP) (Nomura et al., 2005) sem que haja destrui\u00e7\u00e3o do esqueleto de carbono, o que se traduz na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da maior parte do potencial energ\u00e9tico do combust\u00edvel (Wang and Krawiec, 1996).\nNo entanto este processo apresenta algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es que t\u00eam impedido a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o industrial. Uma delas \u00e9, por exemplo, a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o da BDS do DBT na presen\u00e7a de sulfatos ou outras fontes de enxofre de acesso f\u00e1cil. Alguns estudos demonstraram que bastam pequenas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de sulfatos para se inibir completamente a dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o (Kim et al., 2004; Mohebali et al., 2008). E isto obriga a que se usem meios com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es nulas ou residuais de sulfatos quando se cultivam os microrganismos.\nOutro problema \u00e9 o custo do processo, que apesar de ser mais barato do que a HDS profunda, n\u00e3o deixa de ser um processo algo dispendioso, recaindo uma grande parte dos custos (entre 30 a 40 % do total) sobre o meio de cultura (Ma et al., 2006). Assim para tornar este processo mais atractivo \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio procurar alternativas mais baratas, como por exemplo o uso de fontes de carbono resultantes de res\u00edduos agro-industriais, desperd\u00edcios ou plantas de cultivo f\u00e1cil (Alves et al., 2008) Nessa categoria, h\u00e1 muitos produtos com capacidades para serem usados como fontes de carbono alternativas, como por exemplo a polpa de alfarroba (Ceratonia siliqua L.), que \u00e9 um res\u00edduo resultante do processamento das sementes de alfarrobeira, aquando da extrac\u00e7\u00e3o da goma. Esta polpa caracteriza-se por ser extremamente rica em a\u00e7\u00facares como sacarose, glucose e frutose (50 % (g/v)), sendo facilmente utilizada para produzir xaropes ricos em a\u00e7\u00facar (Manso et al., 2010) j\u00e1 testados com sucesso no crescimento microbiano (Carvalheiro et al., 2011; Mendes et al., 2007; Sanchez-Segado etal., 2012).\nOutro poss\u00edvel exemplo de uma fonte alternativa s\u00e3o os frutos do medronheiro (Arbutus unedo) os medronhos. Os medronheiros s\u00e3o arbustos bastante abundantes em Portugal, mas cujo aproveitamento \u00e9 ainda algo limitado, havendo muito desperd\u00edcio. Os seus frutos caracterizam-se por apresentarem elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de a\u00e7\u00facares (42 a 50% g/v), com 60 % frutose e 40 % glucose (Ayaz et al., 2000; Alarc\u00e3o-E-Silva etal., 2001) e, quando maduros, s\u00e3o facilmente macerados, permitindo fazer sumos altamente ricos em a\u00e7\u00facar com provas dadas como fontes de carbono para o crescimento microbiano (Santo et al., 2012).\nUma outra poss\u00edvel fonte de carbono s\u00e3o os tub\u00e9rculos de tupinambo (Helianthus tuberosus). Esta planta, cultivada em todo o mundo, caracteriza-se por ter teores elevados de a\u00e7\u00facares, sob a forma de inulina. A inulina \u00e9 um polissac\u00e1rido formado por uma cadeia de frutose com liga\u00e7\u00f5es p (2 ^1) em que, uma mol\u00e9cula de glucose est\u00e1 ligada a cada extremidade atrav\u00e9s de uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o a (1\t2). Esta planta \u00e9 resistente \u00e0 seca,\nao gelo, a parasitas, a doen\u00e7as, aos solos salinos e n\u00e3o necessita de grandes quantidades de fertilizantes (Zhao, 2011), sendo por isso muitas vezes utilizada na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de solos em \u00e1reas desertificadas (Cheng, 2009). Estas caracter\u00edsticas fazem do tupinambo uma fonte de carbono atractiva tendo tamb\u00e9m j\u00e1 sido testado com sucesso no crescimento microbiano (Gencheva et al., 2012, Cheng et al., 2009, Liang et al., 2012)\nO uso destas fontes alternativas para a BDS tem no entanto um inconveniente, que se prende com o facto de estas apresentarem concentra\u00e7\u00f5es consider\u00e1veis de sulfatos (Frazer, 1935; Werther et al., 2000). Portanto, para impedir que ocorra inibi\u00e7\u00e3o da dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o, torna-se importante remov\u00ea-los. Um dos m\u00e9todos mais comuns de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfatos baseia-se na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de b\u00e1rio sobe a forma de BaCl2 para precipitar os sulfatos (Jegadeesan etal., 2005). Quando em solu\u00e7\u00e3o, o cloreto de b\u00e1rio dissocia-se, permitindo que o b\u00e1rio\nse ligue aos sulfatos formando BaSO4. Este apresenta uma baixa solubilidade (0.00285 g/L a 30 \u00b0C) e portanto precipita sendo facilmente removido (Guo etal., 2009).\nDentro dos microrganismos conhecidos pelo seu potencial para a biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o pode destacar-se o g\u00e9nero Gordonia (Kim et al., 1999, 2000; Mohebali et al., 2007a). Este apresenta j\u00e1 v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies descritas como capazes de dessulfurizar o DBT pela via 4S, como por exemplo Gordonia sp. estirpe CYKS1 (Rhee et al., 1998), Gordonia desulfuricans, Gordonia nitida e Gordonia alkanivorans (Shavandi et al., 2009, 2010; Mohebali etal., 2007a, 2007b, 2008; Alves etal., 2004).\nO g\u00e9nero Gordonia (Goodfellow and Alderson, 1977) enquadra-se na ordem dos Actinomycetales, subordem Corynebacterineae e caracteriza-se por englobar microrganismos aer\u00f3bicos, com presen\u00e7a de catalase, gram-vari\u00e1veis a gram-positivos, n\u00e3o formadores de esporos. De acordo com o NCBI, at\u00e9 Agosto de 2012 estavam descritas 32 esp\u00e9cies de Gordonia. Estas foram isoladas dos mais variados tipos de ambientes: da rizosfera do solo, de po\u00e7os de petr\u00f3leo, de solos contaminados com hidrocarbonetos, de bio-reactores de tratamento de \u00e1guas residuais ou at\u00e9 de cad\u00e1veres. Apesar de algumas esp\u00e9cies de Gordonia serem patog\u00e9nicos oportunistas como G. bronchialis (Sng et al., 2004) e G. araii (Jannat-Khah et al., 2009), na sua maioria o g\u00e9nero \u00e9 conhecido pelas suas caracter\u00edsticas de bio-remedi\u00e7\u00e3o e biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos mais variados compostos (Arenskotter et al., 2004), bem como pela produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biosurfactantes, caroten\u00f3ides e \u201cGordonano\u201d um polissac\u00e1rido que induz agrega\u00e7\u00e3o celular (De los Reyes et al., 1998a, 1998b, De Miguel et al., 2001, Kondo etal., 2000)\nEste trabalho centra-se na bact\u00e9ria Gordonia alkanivorans estirpe 1B, que foi isolada a partir de amostras de solo recolhidas dos terrenos contaminados de hidrocarbonetos na \u00e1rea da EXPO-98 (Lisboa, Portugal) (Alves et al., 2004). Quando cultivada em meio m\u00ednimo sem sulfatos, com glucose como \u00fanica fonte de carbono, esta estirpe foi capaz de dessulfurizar o DBT, reduzindo-o de 478 para 168 pM em 120 h, o que corresponde a uma taxa especifica de dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o de 1.03 pmol de DBT/ (g peso seco/h) (Alves et al., 2004).\nUma fonte de carbono alternativa rica em glucose foi tamb\u00e9m testada anteriormente com sucesso. Usando hidrolisados de lamas de papel reciclado como \u00fanica fonte de carbono obtiveram-se valores de dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o e crescimento superiores aos observados em glucose, com o consumo de 250 pM de DBT em 96 h correspondendo a uma produtividade especifica de 2-HBP de 1.1 pmol/ (g (peso seco) /h) e um pmax de 0.035 h- , claramente superior ao obtido com glucose (0.019 h-) (Alves etal., 2008).\nMais recentemente esta estirpe foi descrita como sendo frutof\u00edlica (Alves and Paix\u00e3o, 2011) o que significa que consome preferencialmente frutose e n\u00e3o a glucose, crescendo e dessulfurizando mais depressa quando a frutose \u00e9 a \u00fanica fonte de carbono. Assim, este trabalho tenta tirar proveito dessa caracter\u00edstica metab\u00f3lica para explorar novas fontes de carbono alternativas ricas em frutose e determinar qual a melhor para a biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o realizada pela estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B.\nUma vez que os dados relativos \u00e0 frutofilia s\u00e3o escassos, foi necess\u00e1rio fazer uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre os rendimentos em biomassa relativo ao crescimento com glucose e aqueles obtidos com frutose. Assim foram realizados crescimentos da estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B, em frasco agitado, com 25 g/l de glucose ou frutose, com 400 pM de DBT. Usando a glucose como fonte de carbono, a estirpe 1B alcan\u00e7ou a fase estacion\u00e1ria ao fim de 287 h com uma taxa especifica m\u00e1xima de crescimento (pmax) de 0.030 h- . Com frutose o crescimento\n1\nbacteriano atingiu o valor m\u00e1ximo entre as 117 e 161 h e uma pmax de 0.070 h- .\nPara avaliar a capacidade de biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o, foi analisada a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP. Durante o crescimento em glucose a estirpe 1B produziu 306 pM de 2-HBP em 312 h com o consumo total do DBT. Assim, em m\u00e9dia foram produzidos 12 pmol de 2-HBP por cada grama de a\u00e7\u00facar consumido e a taxa espec\u00edfica m\u00e1xima\n-1 -1\nde produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP (q2-HBP) foi de 1.19 pmol g- (peso seco) h- . No crescimento em frutose a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima de 2-HBP (393 pM) foi atingida em 89 h sem o consumo completo da fonte de carbono (sobrando 2 g/l de frutose) e com o desaparecimento completo do DBT. Isto traduz-se numa q2-HBP de 6.565\n-1 -1\npmol g- (peso seco) h- com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 17 pmol de 2-HBP por cada grama de frutose consumida. Estes resultados confirmam os resultados obtidos por Alves &amp; Paix\u00e3o (2011), ou seja, confirmam que esta estirpe \u00e9 frutof\u00edlica. Nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es testadas, verific\u00e1mos um aumento da taxa de crescimento quando a estirpe 1B foi cultivada com frutose como fonte de carbono, obteve-se um aumento na taxa de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP por grama de a\u00e7\u00facar e houve um aumento na taxa espec\u00edfica m\u00e1xima de dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o que atingiu um valor\n5.5\tvezes superior ao obtido em glucose.\nNo estudo de potenciais fontes de carbono alternativas, foram seleccionados produtos com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas de frutose, como a polpa de alfarroba (40 % frutose), os medronhos (60 %) e os tub\u00e9rculos de tupinambo (80%). Partindo destas fontes foram elaborados sumos e xaropes ricos em a\u00e7\u00facares, que foram posteriormente optimizados para a biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s de uma hidr\u00f3lise \u00e1cida e da remo\u00e7\u00e3o dos sulfatos neles contidos.\nComparando os teores de a\u00e7\u00facar entre as fontes n\u00e3o tratadas, verificou-se que o xarope de alfarroba apresentou a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00facares totais mais elevada (339g/l), mas tamb\u00e9m a menor percentagem de frutose (19%), sendo que aproximadamente 51 % dos seus a\u00e7\u00facares se encontravam sob a forma de sacarose (constitu\u00edda por 50 % de frutose) O sumo de medronho apresentou 173 g/l de a\u00e7\u00facares, dos quais 67% eram frutose, e o sumo de tupinambo foi o que apresentou menor conte\u00fado em a\u00e7\u00facares totais (~22g/l) dos quais ~52 % s\u00e3o frutose (n\u00e3o estando contabilizadas as mais de 120 g/l de inulina presentes no sumo).\nAnalisando o teor de sulfatos do xarope e dos sumos n\u00e3o tratados verificou-se que, como esperado, todos apresentavam quantidades detect\u00e1veis: o xarope de alfarroba ~49 mg/l, o sumo de medronho ~41 mg/l e o sumo de tupinambo apresentou os valores mais elevados, ~451 mg/l.\nAssim, antes de prosseguir com o estudo destas fontes de carbono alternativas foi fundamental testar o efeito inibit\u00f3rio dos sulfatos na dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o do DBT pela estirpe 1B. Usando 10 g/l de frutose como fonte de carbono e concentra\u00e7\u00f5es progressivamente mais elevadas de sulfatos, determinou-se o efeito inibit\u00f3rio na\ndessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o avaliando a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP. Analisando os resultados verificou-se que, nestas condi\u00e7\u00f5es, at\u00e9 concentra\u00e7\u00f5es reduzidas de sulfatos (6 mg/l) provocam algum efeito inibit\u00f3rio (22,4 %) e que 60 mg/l s\u00e3o suficientes para provocar a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o completa. Por fim o IC50 \u00e0s 72 h para a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o da dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o pelos sulfatos foi estimado em 13,6 \u00b1 0,6 mg/l, um valor diferente do determinado por Mohebali e colaboradores (2008), que observaram inibi\u00e7\u00e3o total da biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma estirpe de Gordonia alkanivorans com 14,4 mg/l de sulfato; no entanto esta observa\u00e7\u00e3o foi feita em condi\u00e7\u00f5es diferentes e com uma estirpe diferente de G. alkanivorans.\nEstes resultados reafirmam que, para termos uma dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o eficaz, s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias concentra\u00e7\u00f5es baixas de sulfatos e, tendo em conta os valores registados nas fontes de carbono alternativas, surge a necessidade de reduzir as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es nelas presentes. Para tal foram realizados testes preliminares para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o dos sulfatos com o cloreto de b\u00e1rio. Estes revelaram ser necess\u00e1ria uma temperatura de pelo menos 30 \u00b0C para que a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o ocorra de forma eficaz. Partindo desses resultados procedeu-se \u00e0 optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos tratamentos atrav\u00e9s de um planeamento experimental seguindo uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de dois factores, fazendo variar a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de BaCl2, o tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao BaCl2 ou o pH a que ocorre a reac\u00e7\u00e3o, para o xarope de alfarroba e para o sumo de tupinambo. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es \u00f3ptimas para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfatos da alfarroba foram 0,4 % (w/v) BaCl2 durante 36 h a 30 \u00b0C (Silva et al., in press), e do tupinambo foram 0,5% (w/v) BaCl2 durante 36 h a 30 \u00b0C e pH 8,73.\nQuando se utiliza o xarope de alfarroba como fonte de carbono no crescimento com G. alkanivorans estirpe 1B, com 25 g/l de a\u00e7\u00facares totais, h\u00e1 um efeito inibit\u00f3rio do crescimento celular. Independentemente dos tratamentos a que foi sujeito, sempre que a estirpe foi cultivada com este xarope, houve uma paragem prematura do crescimento antes que se desse o consumo completo quer da fonte de carbono quer da fonte de enxofre (DBT). O xarope de alfarroba n\u00e3o tratado e n\u00e3o hidrolisado permitiu ainda assim alcan\u00e7ar uma pmax de 0.1099 h- . No entanto, devido aos sulfatos e outras fontes de enxofre presentes no meio, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP foi de apenas 50 pM em 93 h com uma q2-HBP de 0,43 pmol g- (peso seco) h- \u25a0 Nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es \u00f3ptimas para dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o os resultados foram melhores e apesar de ter havido uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o na pmax para\n-1 -1\n0.0595 h- a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP alcan\u00e7ou os 117 pM em 70 h, com uma q2-HBP de 1,56 pmol g- (peso seco) -1\nh- , resultando na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 8 pmol de 2-HBP por grama de a\u00e7\u00facar consumido. Comparando os resultados que se obtiveram utilizando os diferentes xaropes, verifica-se que os tratamentos tiveram um efeito positivo, levando a um aumento da biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o, ainda que o efeito inibit\u00f3rio se mantivesse.\nO sumo de medronho revelou-se imposs\u00edvel de dessulfurizar pelo m\u00e9todo de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o dos sulfatos por adi\u00e7\u00e3o de cloreto de b\u00e1rio. Quando se adiciona BaCl2 ao sumo, este reage, aumentando gradualmente a sua viscosidade, at\u00e9 que, em poucas horas, acaba por se converter numa geleia bastante s\u00f3lida, o que o torna in\u00fatil como fonte de carbono para este g\u00e9nero de ensaios. Por outro lado, mesmo sem ser tratado, este sumo mostrou ter outro inconveniente, no decorrer do crescimento, se for usado com uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 25 g/l de a\u00e7\u00facares totais, este sumo leva a que ocorra uma queda abrupta do pH do meio, de valores superiores a 6 para valores de aproximadamente 3. Isto vai provocar um choque \u00e1cido e a morte da cultura microbiana antes do consumo total da fonte de carbono. Assim para ultrapassar este problema, foi necess\u00e1rio reduzir a\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de sumo de medronho para 10g/l de a\u00e7\u00facares totais, mantendo os 400 pM de DBT. Isto permitiu que o crescimento decorresse de forma normal com o consumo total da fonte de carbono, apresentando uma pmax de 0.0469 h- e uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 146 pM 2-HBP em 94 h com uma q2-HBP de 5 pmol\n1 1\ng- (peso seco) h- e uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o media de 15 pmol de 2-HBP por grama de a\u00e7\u00facar.\nDe entre as fontes de carbono alternativas testadas, aquela em que os resultados mais beneficiaram com a optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos tratamentos foi o sumo de tupinambo. Quando este foi usado como fonte de carbono, na sua forma n\u00e3o tratada e n\u00e3o hidrolisada, com uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o equivalente a 25 g/l de a\u00e7\u00facares redutores, permitiu que a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B crescesse ate uma densidade \u00f3ptica de 4,72 (a 600 nm), com uma\n-1\npmax de 0,0546 h- sem que ocorresse qualquer produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP. Uma hidr\u00f3lise acida deste sumo permitiu converter a inulina em frutose e glucose e isto resultou numa maior concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00facares dispon\u00edveis para a bacteria, que e incapaz de consumir inulina. Assim, quando o sumo hidrolisado foi utilizado como fonte de carbono (a 25 g/l de a\u00e7\u00facares totais) a bacteria conseguiu atingir n\u00e3o s\u00f3 um crescimento maximo superior\n-1\n(13,15 de absorvancia a 600 nm), com tambem uma pmax mais acentuada (0,0816 h-). No entanto, as elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de sulfatos causaram a total inibi\u00e7\u00e3o da dessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o tendo sido registada qualquer produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP. Para superar este problema foi necess\u00e1rio recorrer \u00e0 conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o da hidr\u00f3lise acida com o tratamento optimizado com BaCl2 para desta forma, remover os sulfatos. Utilizando o sumo de tupinambo tratado e hidrolisado (a 25 g/l de a\u00e7\u00facares totais) n\u00e3o se verificaram quaisquer efeitos inibit\u00f3rios e\n-1\na estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B atingiu um maximo de absorvancia de 15 (a 600 nm) com uma pmax de 0,06 h- . Para alem do mais, ate ao fim do crescimento ocorreu o consumo completo da fonte de carbono e, ao contr\u00e1rio do observado com as restantes fontes alternativas, deu-se o consumo total da fonte de enxofre em apenas 96 h. Ou seja, nestas condi\u00e7\u00f5es foi poss\u00edvel dessulfurizar 400 pM de DBT em 400 pM de 2-HBP com\n-1\t-1\numa q2-HBP de 5,06 pmol g- (peso seco) h- resultando numa media de 16 pmol de 2-HBP por grama de a\u00e7\u00facar.\nComo alternativa ao tratamento por hidr\u00f3lise \u00e1cida, para converter a inulina e permitir que o crescimento da estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B, e tambem poss\u00edvel recorrer \u00e0 ac\u00e7\u00e3o enzim\u00e1tica, com o aux\u00edlio de inulinases, enzimas que degradam especificamente a inulina em frutose e glucose. Assim, foi testado o potencial de um extracto enzim\u00e1tico Talf1 (Paix\u00e3o et al., 2012) num processo de sacarifica\u00e7\u00e3o e fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o simultanea (SSF) para a biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o com a bacteria. Ap\u00f3s se ter obtido resultados positivos com a inulina pura, progrediu-se para a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o no sumo de tupinambo n\u00e3o tratado e como tambem este revelou resultados positivos, prosseguiu-se finalmente para o sumo de tupinambo submetido ao tratamento \u00f3ptimo com BaCl2 mas n\u00e3o hidrolisado. Assim a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B foi cultivada com ~10 g/l de a\u00e7\u00facares totais provenientes do tupinambo e suplementada pela adi\u00e7\u00e3o de 5 % (v/v) de extracto enzim\u00e1tico Talf1. A an\u00e1lise destes resultados mostrou que ocorreu um melhoramento consider\u00e1vel de todos os parametros analisados,\n-1\nnomeadamente no crescimento microbiano, tendo sido atingida uma maior pmax (0,1288 h-) e na maior -1 -1\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-hidroxibifenil, com uma q2-HBP de 8,33 pmol g-1 (peso seco) h-1, e numa produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 28 pmol de 2-HBP por grama de a\u00e7\u00facar consumido.\nDa an\u00e1lise global deste estudo pode concluir-se que a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B foi capaz de crescer e dessulfurizar com as tr\u00eas fontes de carbono alternativas. No entanto, o sumo de tupinambo, depois de optimizado, mostrou ser a melhor alternativa, permitindo valores de crescimento microbiano e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-HBP semelhantes ou mesmo superiores aos obtidos com frutose comercial. O tupinambo \u00e9 uma fonte barata e f\u00e1cil de obter ou cultivar e que apresenta boa potencialidade para a biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o utilizando a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B, abrindo assim caminho a que, no futuro, possa contribuir para uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos custos associados ao processo da biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o de crude.\nPalavras-Chave: Biodessulfuriza\u00e7\u00e3o, Combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis, Dibenzotiofeno, Gordonia alkanivorans estirpe 1B, Fontes de carbono alternativas, Bact\u00e9ria frutof\u00edlica.\nAbstract\nBiodesulfurization of fossil fuels still presents limitations that hinder its industrial application. One is the cost of the culture media formulation for the production of biocatalysts. Another is related to the levels of sulfates in the medium, which provoke the inhibition of desulfurization even in small concentrations.\nIn this context, the goal of this work was to test different agro-industrial materials and assess the biodesulfurization ability of G. alkanivorans strain 1B. Knowing that this bacterium is fructophilic, only fructose rich alternative carbon sources were selected. Thus, carob pulp, strawberry tree fruits (STF) and Jerusalem artichoke tubers were used to produce sugar-rich liquors and juices, which were optimized through acidic hydrolysis and sulfate removal with BaCl2. The treatments proved successful in improving desulfurization with two carbon sources, but not with STF juice. This juice reacted adversely to BaCl2 and pH changes, so only lower concentrations allowed normal cellular growth and 2-HBP production, which achieved 146 pM in 94 h with a maximum specific productivity (q2-HBP) of 5.00 pmol g- (dry cell weight) h- . Carob pulp liquor revealed inhibitory effects, causing cellular growth to stop before full consumption of either sugars or DBT. Even with\n-1 -1\noptimal biodesulfurization conditions, q2-HBP was only of 1.56 pmol g- (DCW) h- . Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) proved to be the best source for biodesulfurization. When hydrolyzed, treated with BaCl2 and with 25 g/l total sugars, JAJ allowed the complete conversion of 400 pM DBT into 2-HBP in 73- 96 h with a q2-HBP of 5.06\n-1 -1\npmol g- (DCW) h- . When treated and non-hydrolyzed, JAJ was used in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with 5 % (v/v) Talf1 enzyme extract (inulinases), the results were improved, resulting in the\n-1 -1\nhighest q2-HBP (8.33 pmol g- (DCW) h-). These results highlight the great potential of JAJ as a cheaper alternative carbon source for biodesulfurization.\nKeywords: Biodesulfurization; Dibenzothiophene; Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B;

recent years there has been an increase of the world's energy demands, which, according to long term previsions, should continue to rise by 51 % between 2010 and 2035 (OPEC, 2011). Fossil fuels currently account for 87 % of primary commercial energy supply, 29 % of total energy is obtained from coal, 24 % comes from natural gas, and the biggest portion, 34 % comes from oil. Even though developed countries are restricting the use fossil fuel derivatives, predictions point to an increase of oil demand, mostly in the emerging economical potencies such as China and India, but also in the less developed countries. Overall, until 2035 there should be an increase of over 20 % [86.8 to 109.7 million barrels a day (Mb/d)] of oil demands. As a response to this growing tendency, production has been rising considerably. In 1990 about 65 million barrels of oil were produced each day, with an average sulfur content of about 1.1 %. In 2010 the world production rose to 86.4 Mb/d and predictions point to an increase up to 93.5 Mb/d in 2035 (OPEC, 2011).\nBiofuels are proposed by many as the viable alternative to fossil fuels, however these do have some drawbacks: they have lower energy content per unit of volume (Achten et al., 2008), cause excessive wear of engines (Girtler et al., 2010), have bigger temporal instability (Nelson et al., 2010), their availability is limited (Weyer et al., 2010) and there is a lack of infrastructures to produce and distribute biofuels (Stephen et al., 2010). So, now and in the near future, biofuels shouldn't be able to substitute fossil fuels in the global or domestic energy profile; thus, the majority of fuels of this century should still be produced from the hydrocarbon feed stocks of fossil origin.\nIt is a well-known fact that fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source, and with the increase in demand even optimistic previsions point to 84 years' worth of oil reserves. In order to expand these reserves, oil companies are forced to search for heavier and more contaminated crude oils which wouldn't be used in other circumstances. These are characterized by having higher viscosity, and greater concentrations of heavy metals, sulfur and other undesirable particles. Since the world's resources on heavy oil are more than twice those of conventional light crude oil (Javadli and Klerk, 2012), it makes them a possible midterm solution for the industry.\n1.2\tSulfur\nPetroleum is considerably rich in sulfur. In fact it is its third most abundant element, after carbon and hydrogen (Pokethitiyook et al., 2008). The average sulfur content varies from 0.03 to 7.89 mass % in crude oil (Soleimani et al., 2007), but depending on the sulfur content of any given crude oil supply, the sulfur concentration of the middle distillate fraction used to make diesel fuels can range widely from &lt;500 to > 5000 mg/L (Mohebali and Ball, 2008). Sulfur compounds can be divided in to two forms: inorganic and organic. Inorganic sulfur, such as elemental sulfur, H2S and pyrite is present in both dissolved and suspended form (Agarwal and Sharma, 2010). Organic sulfur comprised of thiols, sulfides, and thiophenic compounds represents the main source of sulfur found in crude oil. Crude oils with higher viscosities and higher densities usually contain higher amounts of more complex sulfur compounds. While aliphatic acyclic sulfides\n(thioethers) and cyclic sulfides (thiolanes) are easy to remove, the sulfur contained in aromatic rings, such as thiophene and its derivatives, which can be up to 70 % of total sulfur (e.g. benzothiophene, dibenzothiophene, benzonaphthothiophene), is much more recalcitrant (Gray et al.,1995; Aminsefat et al., 2012; Javadli and Klerk, 2012).\n1.3\tPollution\nSince the beginning of the industrial revolution the Earth's atmosphere has been increasingly attacked by exhausts from both static and moving pollution sources that burn fossil fuels and release harmful pollutants which cause extensive changes to the natural characteristics of the air (Nuhu, 2012).\nThe combustion of fossil fuel generates emissions of nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, sulfur as sulfur dioxide (SO2), that is corrosive and toxic, and the fine particulate matter of metal sulfates. These emissions are responsible for damages in many different areas. Gaseous chemical compounds of sulfur constitute a major health hazard when present in the air: the large-ring thiophenes, such as dibenzothiophene, abundant in crude oil, are toxic to mammals (Murphy et al., 1992); SO2 gas at high levels can cause bronchial irritation and trigger asthma attacks in susceptible individuals and long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important risk factor for cardio-pulmonary and lung cancer mortality (Pope et al., 2002; Mohebali et al., 2008). In addition, incomplete burning of liquid fossil fuels causes emissions of aromatic sulfur compounds to the air (Ho and Lee, 2002), and the oxidation of sulfur compounds in the atmosphere eventually leads to aerosol of sulfuric acid. This aerosol causes acid rains, which are responsible for the corrosion of many infrastructures and monuments, and even affect several living organisms including agricultural crops, thus causing direct damage to the economy (Bender and Weigel, 2011). The aerosol is also harmful to the stratospheric ozone contributing to the hole on the Earth's protective ozone layer (Denis, 2010). Lastly, sulfur compounds even prevent functioning of all major pollution control technologies such as automobile catalytic converters (Maricq etal., 2002) making it more difficult to fight against pollution.\nSince gasoline, diesel and non-transportation fuels account for 75 to 80 % of the total refinery products (Babich and Moulijn, 2003), it's only natural that countries find the reductions of sulfur concentration in fuels as the most effective way to decrease the amount of SO2 emitted in to the air and limit its prejudicial effects (Mohebali and Ball, 2008).\n1.4\tRegulations\nAs a response to these problems, in recent years there has been an increasing concern regarding the sulfur levels in fossil fuel and its derivatives. Throughout the world countries have been drastically reducing the legal limits on sulfur concentration of these energy sources. This can be illustrated by limits on on-road diesel and gasoline, as shown on Figure 1 and 2 respectively.\nSince 2003 and up to 2010, the USA has lowered the legal limit from 3400 to 30 ppm maximum standard for all refiners. EU member states also showed their concern and since 2005 they have required certain volumes of 10 ppm fuels in their markets, alongside 50 ppm fuels. This was further tightened in January 2009, when\nthe EU stipulated that all gasoline and on-road diesel should contain a maximum sulfur content of 10 ppm, with off-road diesel sulfur reaching the same level in January 2011. China's response came in December 2009 with the establishment of a nationwide gasoline sulfur limit of 150 ppm. Stricter fuel quality requirements of 50 ppm also have been imposed in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzen. China is expected to lower its nationwide limits to 50 ppm by December 2013, and possibly to a maximum 10 ppm in the 2016 time frame. India has also required 150 ppm sulfur gasoline nationwide and 50 ppm sulfur gasoline for 13 selected cities with large vehicle populations and high pollution levels since September 2010.\nFigure 1 - Representation of the legal sulfur maximum concentration in on-road diesel by September 2011 throughout the world.

Adapted from the \"World oil outlook\" by \"Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u201d (OPEC).\nThis tendency should continue, as OPEC predictions point to even greater increases in limitations worldwide. As Table 1 and 2 illustrate, the next decades should bring the sulfur legal limits to historic lows, as even African and Middle Eastern countries bring down their maxima.\nIn order to keep up with increasingly stricter regulations, the oil industry had to develop methods that would effectively remove the sulfur from the fossil fuels.\nTable 1- Expected regional gasoline sulfur content.

But the best known and widespread method is hydrodesulfurization (HDS).This is a catalytic process which consists on the conversion of the organic sulfur present in the fuel oil into hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S) by making it react with the oil at high pressures, between 150 and 3000 psi, and high temperatures, between 290 and 455 \u00b0C, in a fixed-bed reactor with the aid of metal catalysts such as CoMo/Al2O3 or NiMo/Al2O3 (Nikkolaj etal., 2000; Whitehurst etal., 1998; Shafi and Hutchings, 2000; Javadli and Klerk, 2012).\nEven though HDS can easily remove great amounts of sulfur, it isn't enough to meet the legal demands. This is mostly because this technique isn't effective at removing complex polycyclic sulfur compounds, very abundant in these oils, such as dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives which still remain even after HDS. Molecules such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-2mDBT), which have alkyl groups surrounding the sulfur atom, are extremely hard to desulfurize because of low reaction rates. These recalcitrant compounds represent a significant barrier to reach very low sulfur levels in middle and heavy distillate-range fuels (Grossman et al., 2001; Javadli and Klerk, 2012; Chen et al., 2009; Monticello, 2000; Onaka et al., 2001).\nsophisticated and expensive catalysts (Klein et al., 1999; Dolbear and Skov, 2000; Abotsi and Scaroni, 1989). The final desulfurization level is influenced by many factors such as the properties of the specific catalyst used (active species concentration, support properties, synthesis route), the reaction conditions (sulfiding protocol, temperature, partial pressure of hydrogen and H2S), the nature and concentration of the sulfur compounds and reactor and process design (Babich and Moulijn, 2003). Deep HDS technology, however, has several drawbacks, most of them being direct consequences of the extreme conditions applied, which limit its usefulness. Firstly they make the process of removing the organic sulfur too expensive (McFarland, 1999) and substantially increase its carbon footprint (Singh et al., 2012); they alter the final product by causing undesirable effects on fuel quality, because the higher temperatures and pressures allow the reduction of other chemical components (Folsom et al., 1999), thereby reducing the octane number of the fuel (Reichmuth et al., 2000; Javadli and Klerk, 2012; Dolbear and Skov, 2000); the catalysts\u2019 lifespan is shortened by the poisoning effect of the generated H2S (the heavier the feedstock, the faster the catalyst deactivates) (Furimsky and Massoth, 1992; Vogelaar et al., 2003); the used catalysts form a hazardous waste and its disposal poses problems (Bhatia and Sharma, 2012); and deep HDS is affected by components in the reaction mixture such as organic hetero-compounds and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Egorova, 2003; Folsom etal., 1999; Konishi etal., 2000; Monticello, 1996).\nAlthough HDS processes have dominated desulfurization of petroleum in the past as the sulfur limits are decreased, there will be a need to increase the number of HDS units with large new capital investments and/or higher operating costs. This, combined with successive economic crisis, motivates the development of innovative process technologies and opens the path to explore alternative desulfurization pathways (Chandra Srivastava, 2012).\n1.6\tBiodesulfurization\nBiotechnology is based on the use of living organisms to produce or modify products for specific applications. Nowadays it has become an important tool for the development of new approaches and solutions in many areas, such as agriculture, food, pharmaceutical or environment industries (Gavrilescu and Chisti, 2005; Singh, 2010). The biological catalysts are capable of operating in a wide range of ambient temperature and pressure and have a high selectivity, so their application results in a reduction of energy costs, lower emissions and minimal generation of undesirable by-products (Borgne and Quintero, 2003; Singh et al., 2006; Sen, 2008).\nPetroleum refining is traditionally based on the use of physicochemical processes, however, because of its characteristics, the biotechnological approach has become an attractive alternative or complement in the development of new petroleum refining processes as well as in the remediation and disposal practices during the last two decades. Several microorganisms and their enzymes have already been studied on both laboratory and pilot scale to apply on several parts of the refining process, such as biodenitrogenation, biodemetallation, biodemulsification and microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR), biological control of reservoir souring and transformation of heavy crude to light crude (Singh et al., 2006; Sen 2008, Huang et al.,\n2010). Although many biotransformation processes have been described, many opportunities remain to be exploited in this area (Mohebali and Ball, 2008; Singh etal., 2012).\nThe removal of sulfur mediated by microorganisms or biodesulfurization (BDS) is already an extensively studied approach. The first studies were reported in the 50's and 60's, but only in the last 20 years have there been successful breakthroughs (Soleimani et al., 2007; Debabov, 2010; Alves and Paix\u00e3o, 2011). Through BDS it is possible to remove most of the HDS recalcitrant sulfur compounds at mild operating conditions without molecular hydrogen (Reichmuth et al., 2000), resorting to microorganisms that can remove sulfur from DBT and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Mohebali and Ball, 2008; Caro et al., 2007) using them as their sulfur source making it an easy and environmental friendly process. Furthermore studies also shown that BDS requires approximately two times less capital and 15 % less operating costs in comparison with traditional HDS (Pacheco et al., 1999; Linguist and Pacheco 1999; Kaufman et al., 1998).\n1.7\tModel Compounds\nIn biodesulfurization studies the most commonly used model compound is DBT (Bressler and Fedorak, 2001).This molecule, as stated before, is very abundant in crude oil, it is also a recalcitrant substance hard to desulfurize by HDS, and its alkyl derivatives are considered amongst the hardest to desulfurize by traditional methods (Borgne and Quintero, 2003), surviving even to deep HDS treatment (Amorelli et al., 1992). In addition, contrary to other substances, DBT is easy to manipulate since it's not mutagenic or extremely hazardous to human health (Kropp and Fedorak, 1998; Alves, 2007).\n1.8\tDibenzothiophene biodesulfurization\nAnaerobic biodesulfurization\nIn anaerobic environments, BDS follows the reductive desulfurization scheme. Through it organic sulfur is converted into hydrogen sulfide, which is then catalytically converted into elemental sulfur. This approach may be of some use at the refinery (Kaufman et al., 1998) since oxidation of hydrocarbons to undesired compounds, such as colored and gum-forming products, is residual (McFarland, 1999). However, maintaining an anaerobic process is extremely difficult and the specific activity of most of the isolated strains have been reported to be insignificant for DBTs (Armstrong et al., 1995).\nAerobic biodesulfurization\nUnder aerobic conditions, desulfurization occurs through oxidative pathways. These result in the production of sulfate, which is water-soluble and can be removed with the aqueous phase.\nDifferent species may have specificity for particular sulfur compounds, and metabolic pathways are not necessarily restricted to sulfur (Kirkwood et al., 2005, 2007a, b), thus desulfurization may occur differently depending on the substances present.\nThis form of desulfurization, however, comes with an associated carbon cost. BDS is only viable if there is a selectivity of sulfur over carbon. If the carbon metabolism is high, it becomes important to harvest the microorganisms to recover some of the lost carbon.\nThere are three known pathways that attack the DBT molecule:\n-\tThe Kodama pathway: Analogous to the naphthalene degradation pathway (Kodama et al., 1973), begins with the dihydroxylation of the peripheral aromatic ring of the DBT molecule, followed by its cleavage. This results in the accumulation of 3-hydroxy-2-formyl-benzothiophene as a water-soluble end product, with lower carbon content than DBT but with the sulfur atom intact.\n-\tThe Van Afferden pathway: This is another ring-destructive pathway that results in the complete mineralization of DBT. Van Afferden et al. (1993) isolated Brevibacterium sp. DO, capable of using DBT for growth as the sole source of carbon, sulfur and energy. During DBT mineralization first there is an oxidation into DBT sulfone, then an aromatic dioxygenase causes the rupture of the thiophenic ring to form 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2'-sulfinate DBT. Finally a second action of the dioxygenase opens the 2,3-dihyroxybenzene nucleus, resulting in sulfite, which is oxidized to sulfate, and benzoate which is mineralized in to CO2 and H2O.\nThe ring-destructive pathways may be valuable in biodegradation of DBT in the environment. However they aren't commercially useful for the petroleum industry since the destruction of the carbon skeleton of sulfur compounds by the bacteria reduces the fuel's calorific value.\n-\t4S pathway: This is the third and most valuable to the petroleum industry. It owes its name to the formation of four sulfur compounds during the metabolism of DBT. First, a DBT monooxygenase (DszC) catalyzes two oxidation steps and converts DBT into Dibenzothiophenesulfone (DBTS). Then a second monooxigenase, DBT sulfonemonooxigenase (DszA), turns DBTS into 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl), and finally a liase, 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate desulfinase (DszB), promotes the removal of the sulfur resulting in the formation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl and sulfite. There is a fourth enzyme, FMN-reductase (DszD) with an indirect yet important role, since it regulates the activity of the monooxygenases by regulating the levels of reduced flavin (Nomura et al., 2005).\nThis pathway is especially important, because with it the microorganisms are able to remove sulfur from DBT and use it as a sulfur source, but they are incapable of destroying the carbon skeleton, maintaining most of the calorific value of the fossil fuel (Wang and Krawiec, 1996).\nSeveral studies have been conducted using bacterial genera capable of using 4S pathway for BDS, which include Arthrobacter, Agrobacterium, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas and the two most important as of now: Gordonia and Rhodococcus (Clark and Kirk, 1994; Tanaka etal., 2002; Alves etal., 2007; Alves and Paix\u00e3o, 2011).\n1.9\tLimitations of BDS process\nThere are a few limitations to this alternative process, which have delayed its commercial use. Most of the studies presented tend to focus on model compounds (Grossman et al., 2001; Alves, 2007), so results may not translate in the same way when using actual oils. These are much more complex substrates so it is necessary to take into account the problems such as toxicity of compounds present in the oil, as well as the existence of steric hindrance associated with the structure of these compounds that hinder the activity of microbial enzymatic systems (Alves, 2007).\nIn fact, results with actual fossil fuel derivatives are somewhat lower than desired. Studies with petroleum show results of total sulfur removals between 30 and 70 % for mid-distillates (Grossman et al., 1999), 24 to 78 % for hydro-treated diesel (Rhee et al., 1998; Maghsoudi et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2006), 20 to 60 % for light gas oils (Chang etal., 2000; Ishii etal., 2005) and 25 to 60 % for crude oils (McFarland, 1999).\nMoreover, BDS shows a low conversion rate which may be caused by feedback inhibition of the enzyme activities, or even the accumulation of 2-HBP, the product of the 4S pathway, which is extremely toxic to most microorganisms affecting their viability (Alves and Paix\u00e3o, 2011).\nThere are other problems closely related to the large scale operation, such as the difficulty in controlling the various parameters that regulate biocatalyst activity and stability, the oil/water volume ratio, the logistics of sanitary handling, shipment, storage and use of microorganisms within the production field or refinery environment (Javadli And Klerk, 2012). There are also problems associated with the tri-phasic system, one of the most used in BDS (Kaufman et al., 1997; Setti et al., 1997; McFarland et al., 1998). The cells, mixed with water and oil, produce a sort of surfactant, which emulsifies the oil and makes the separation from water very difficult (Naito et al., 2001).This system also makes cell recovery very difficult (Alves, 2007).\nAnother big setback lies in the fact that BDS of DBT is inhibited in the presence of other sulfur compounds in the culture medium. In fact, even small concentrations of sulfate or other easy access sulfur sources produce an inhibitory effect on BDS (Kim et al., 2004; Mohebali et al., 2008). To add up, the bacteria have very low sulfur requirements. In Rhodococcus sp., the cells were found to require 0.1 mM of sulfur for normal growth (Reichmuth et al., 2000). Only 1 % of bacterial dry weight is sulfur (Stoner et al., 1990), which implies a very low need in relation to this element. Therefore, it is important to use feedstocks containing low residual concentration or even a null content of sulfur.\nFinally, there is also a limitation shared with many other biotechnological processes, which is the costs of the culture medium, representing 30 to 40 % of the total, namely the carbon source, which makes the process more expensive. At present, there is no economically suitable method for large-scale preparation of biocatalysts (Ma et al., 2006). Thus, in order to reduce costs, it is important to search for cheap and widely available raw materials. The utilization of alternative carbon sources derived from agro-industrial by-products, wastes or plants that can be grown on marginal land may thereby represent a sustainable strategy to use when searching for carbon sources for biotechnological processes (Alves et al., 2008). Alternative substrates\nhave widely been used as feedstock for several fermentation processes such as for the production of lactic acid (Bustos et al., 2005), polyhydroxybutyrate (Hu et al., 1999), ethanol (Karimi et al., 2006), pullulan (Israilides et al., 1998), xanthan gum (Yoo and Harcum, 1999), bacterial cellulose (Bae and Shoda, 2005), xylanase (Nascimento et al., 2003; Alves et al., 2008) and biocontrol agents (Abadias et al., 2003; Costa et al., 2001; Peighami-Ashnaei etal., 2009; Verma etal., 2007 Manso etal., 2010)\nThere are many examples, where residues were successfully used in order to lower the production costs, such as malt extract, dry beer extract, soy powder, fruit syrups and molasses. However, many more are yet to be explored.\n1.10\tAlternative Carbon sources\n1.10.1\tCarob pulp\nThe carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is a leguminous tree that is native to Mediterranean countries. It is very abundant in Portugal, mostly in the southern area, in Algarve. This tree grows in soft and dry places, preferring poor and calcareous soils (Batlle et al., 1997). It's also drought-resistant and requires little care being regarded as a possible crop for dry land areas for diversification and revitalization of coastal agriculture in its native countries (Tous, 1996).\nRecent data indicates that carob pod production worldwide amounts to nearly 400,000 tons/year, of which 50,000 tons are produced each year in the Algarve, and its interest lies mostly on the seeds. The seed's endosperm is a molecule composed of mannose and galactose sugar units (ratio 4:1). This polysaccharide, LBG or locust bean gum, presents high viscosity in water, over a wide range of temperatures and pH. It can be used as a thickener, stabilizer, binder and gelling agent in the food industry and in several technical applications (Manso et al., 2010), including the manufacture of chemicals, paper and cosmetics as well as in the pharmaceutical industry (Avallone etal., 1997; Makris and Kefalas, 2004; Santos etal., 2005).\nWorld demand for LBG equates to about 30,000 tons of carob seed. The seed is processed in Portugal and the products obtained are exported to Japan, Holland, Denmark and USA (Correia and Martins-Lougao, 2005).\nSince carob seeds represent only 10 % of the weight of the fruit, there is a large amount of waste material in the remaining 90 % of carob pulp. These carob industrial wastes are small carob kibbles with a high content of sugars, around 50 %, mainly sucrose (more than 30 %), fructose and glucose with values of 20 to 50 % (Petit and Pinilla, 1995), 45 % (Avallone et al., 1997), 48 to 56 % (Yousif and Alghzawi, 2000), and 28 to 82 % (Biner et al., 2007). These are easily extractable by water, producing sugar-rich syrups (Manso et al., 2010) which give economical relevance to the carob pulp as an inexpensive and available feedstock for various biological products. Carob pulp is already used as a cocoa substitute in the food industry, or even directly in the diet of farm animals (Lima-Costa etal., 2012).\nEven though carob pods have these applications, at the present most are discarded and not effectively used. For that reason the by-product of this industry represents a cheap and available raw material to produce a value-added product, being among the industrial residues most used as new carbon sources for several bioprocesses (Carvalheiro etal., 2011; Mendes etal., 2007; Sanchez-Segado etal., 2012).\n1.10.2\tStrawberry tree fruit\nThe strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) is native to the Mediterranean region, Western Europe, northern to western France and Ireland. It is very common in Portugal, and its fruit is mainly used as food and as raw material to make a strong alcoholic drink, \u201caguardente de medronho\u201d, as well as jams. It is very im portant in terms of environmental aspects due to its tolerance to dryness and its ability to regenerate and recolonize after forest fires.\nThe fruits are very rich in vitamins, organic acids, phenolic compounds, and their sugar concentration ranges from 42 % to 52 % (Ayaz et al., 2000; Alarcao-E-Silva et al., 2001) of which 60 % is fructose and 40 % is Glucose. There are some studies which report the successful use this fruit as a carbon source (Santo et al., 2012). However, this is mostly an unexplored resource that grows naturally and in large quantities throughout the country.\n1.10.3\tJerusalem artichoke\nJerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) also known as sun root or topinambour, is a species of sunflower. Although native to North America, this species has long since been cultivated throughout the world. It is traditionally grown for animal consumption or sugar production for food, electronics and pharmaceutical applications. (Baldini et al., 2004; Bosticco et al., 1989; Meijer and Mathijssen, 1991; Marchetti, 1993).\nAlthough its yield is lower than other sugar producing plants such as corn or sugar beet it has other advantages. Jerusalem artichoke has high fertility and demands low amounts of fertilizers. It can grow on poor land; it's resistant to pests, diseases and saline soils (Zhao, 2011). Furthermore, it can resist desert conditions and frost better than other cultures. And since it is drought-resistant, it can be used to improve soil and water conservation in desertfied areas (Cheng, 2009).\nInstead of accumulating starch, Jerusalem artichoke tubers accumulate inulin. Inulin is a linear fructan in which a variable number of fructose units are linked by p (2 ^1) bonds, and glucose typically ends the inulin chain through an a (1\t2) bond. Inulin is soluble in water and after hydrolytic breakdown the reducing sugars\nfructose and glucose are released.\nThese characteristics make this plant a natural source of fructose for the industry and an attractive alternative carbon source for microbial growth. Several studies have already been conducted not only with inulinaseproducing yeasts for the production of ethanol (Gencheva et al., 2012), but also with microorganisms using the acid-hydrolyzed extracts as carbon source. Jerusalem artichoke has also been used as carbon source for\nthe production of other compounds such as biodiesel (Cheng et al., 2009) and propionic acid (Liang et al., 2012).\n1.11\tSulfur content of the alternative carbon sources\nThe use of alternative carbon sources by desulfurizing bacteria might raise a problem associated to the presence of readily bioavailable sulfur compounds. As it is well known, plant material and agro-residues usually carry considerable amounts of sulfate (Frazer, 1935; Werther et al., 2000), which hinder their use in BDS processes. Thus, in order to use these carbon sources for BDS studies it is first necessary to reduce sulfate concentration to minimum levels and for this, there are several methods. One of the most common is the use of barium, namely in the form of barium chloride (BaCl2), to precipitate the sulfate (Jegadeesan et al., 2005). When mixed in solution, BaCl2 dissociates, allowing the barium atoms to bond with the sulfate groups forming barium sulfate (BaSO4). In this form it has a very low solubility (0.00285 g/L at 30 \u00b0C) and thus immediately precipitates, being easily removed (Guo et al., 2009). Although barium can be hazardous to human health, it becomes less toxic when bound to sulfate allowing an easier manipulation, essential for large scale work. This process is abundantly used in some industries such as bleach factories as a method to remove excess sulfate (Rudie and Hart, 2006) that is relatively easy and cheap to use.\n1.12\tThe genus Gordonia\nThe genus Gordonia was established in 1997, after a first failed attempt in 1971, when Tsukamura proposed the creation of the genus Gordona, whose individuals were subsequently reclassified in the genus Rhodococcus (Goodfellow and Alderson, 1977).\nPhylogenetically, the genus Gordonia belongs to the order Actinomycetales, suborder Corynebacterineae, which makes them a close relative of the genera Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium and Nocardia. According to the NCBI website, as of August of 2012 the genus Gordonia comprised 32 validly published species (NCBI, 2012).\nThe members of this genus are very diverse (Takeuchi and Hatano, 1988) and they are characterized as aerobic, catalase positive, gram-positive to gram-variable bacteria that do not form spores. Gordonia species have been isolated from very different native biotopes such as soil or mangrove rhizosphere, from extensively industrially influenced habitats such as oil-producing wells or hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, from artificial sources such as wastewater treatment bioreactors or biofilters, and from diseased humans. Other Gordonia species have also been isolated from activated sludges in aeration tanks of biological sewage-treatment plants (Lemmer and Kroppenstedt, 1984) and from the packing material of a biofilter used for biological odor abatement (Bendinger et al., 1995; Klatte et al., 1996).\nSome Gordonia species, like G. bronchialis (Sng et al., 2004) or G. araii (Jannat-Khah et al., 2008) are opportunistic pathogens, causing grave diseases in immunosuppressed individuals. However, the genus Gordonia is mostly recognized for other characteristics such as its bioremediation and biodegradation capacities, since these microorganisms are able to degrade xenobiotics, substituted and non-substituted\nhydrocarbons, environmental pollutants and natural compounds that are not readily biodegradable (Arenskotter etal., 2004). Therefore, individuals of this genus are able to act on contaminated soils and water, helping in the recovery of these environments (Luo et al., 2007; Bendinger et al., 1993). Some species such as Gordonia cholesterolivorans can even degrade steroid compounds as cholesterol, cholesterone, ergosterol and stigmasterol (Drzyzga et al., 2011). Others like Gordonia polyisoprenivorans are able to degrade both natural and synthetic rubber (Linos et al., 1999).\nThe individuals of the genus Gordonia also have a great biotechnological potential, since through their anabolic pathways they produce several compounds with many applications. Some species can produce biosurfactants (De los Reyes et al., 1998a, 1998b), carotenoids (De Miguel et al., 2001) and \u201cGordonan\u201d (Kondo et al., 2000), which is a cell aggregation-inducing polysaccharide.\nOne of the most important characteristic of this genus is its ability to perform BDS through the 4S pathway (Kim et al., 1999, 2000; Mohebali et al., 2007a). The first representative of the genus Gordonia described as being capable of DBT desulfurization was Gordonia sp. strain CYKS1 (Rhee et al., 1998). Since then many others have been described within the genus, such as Gordonia desulfuricans, Gordonia nitida and Gordonia alkanivorans. The latter is probably the most studied and the one with greater number of strains important to BDS. In recent years 2 strains have been especially studied: RIPI90A (Shavandi et al., 2009, 2010; Mohebali et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008) and strain 1B.\n1.13\tGordonia alkanivorans strain 1B\nThis work is centered on Gordonia alkanivorans Strain 1B, which was isolated from soil samples harvested from hydrocarbon-contaminated grounds at the EXPO-98 area (Lisbon, Portugal).\nMuch is already known about this strain, since its isolation it has been the center of many studies. In 2004 Alves et al. showed, among other things, that this strain had great desulfurization capabilities. When grown with a minimum medium and with glucose as single carbon source, it reduced DBT concentration from 478 to 168 pM after 120 h of culture, corresponding to a specific desulfurization rate of 1.03 pmol of DBT/(g of dry cell/h). This rate is similar to that obtained with another Gordonia sp. strain, CYKS1 (0.917 pmol of DBT/[g of dry cell/h]), which reduced the concentration of DBT from 320 to 50 pM after 120 h of bacterial cultivation (Rhee et al., 1998). The maximum extracellular concentration of 2-HBP, however, was somewhat lower, about 120 pM, which is only 27 % of the consumed DBT (450 pM). This non-stoichiometric accumulation of 2-HBP had also been observed in Bacillus subtilis strain WU-S2B (Kirimura et al., 2001) and in Nocardia sp. strain CYKS2 (Chang et al.,1998; Alves et al., 2004).\nLater in 2007, another work by the same team studied the strains desulfurization operon (dsz). In their research they identified its genes and compared them with previously described bacterial genes from Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8. Three open reading frames were identified: dszA, dszB and dszC, which showed high similarity to those of IGTS8 (88 % for dszA, 88 % for dszB and 90 % for dszC). In the same work Alves et al., proceeded to clone and express G. alkanivorans dszAB genes in Escherichia coli. The resulting\nrecombinant strain was able to grow in a culture medium containing dibenzothiophene sulfone (DBTS) as the only sulfur source, desulfurizing the same amount of DBTS (0.2 mM) to 2-HBP, but 4.5-fold faster than strain 1B (Alves et al., 2007).\nMore recently Alves and Paix\u00e3o studied the effect of 2-hydroxybiphenyl in cells of both Gordonia alkanivorans 1B and Rhodococcus erythropolis D1 grown in glucose. The IC50 values obtained showed especially the high acute toxicity of 2-HBP with low IC50 values, 0.52 mM for strain D1 and 0.62 mM for strain 1B. These results were also confirmed by the chronic toxicity data which resulted in IC50 of 0.21 to 0.27 mM for strain 1B and IC50 of 0.38 to 0.47 mM for strain D1. They observed that these results were similar to those obtained by Chen et al. (2008), using Microbacterium sp. (41 % of growth inhibition with 0.2 mM 2-HBP) and those obtained by Rhee et al. (1998) with a Gordonia strain (with increase of generation time by about 50 % with 0.2 mM 2-HBP). By analyzing these results they stated that, since 1B's growth rate is slower than that of D1, microorganisms exhibiting faster generation times could be more resistant to 2-HBP accumulation during a BDS process, thus explaining the differences in toxicity (Alves and Paix\u00e3o, 2011).\nSome studies were also conducted to evaluate the performance of the hydrolyzates of recycled paper sludge as alternative low-cost feedstock for biological desulfurization. They showed that this glucose rich hydrolyzate, obtained after enzymatic mixture dialysis (dialyzed hydrolyzate), successfully allowed DBT desulfurization. 250 pM DBT was consumed after 96 h, displaying a maximum specific productivity of 2-hydroxybiphenyl of\n1.1\tpmol/g(dry cell weight)/h. Moreover maximum specific growth rates showed that 1B grows better using hydrolyzates in comparison with the corresponding culture medium containing commercial grade glucose as the only carbon source (pmax for dialyzed hydrolyzate recycled paper sludge was 0.035 h- while pmax for glucose was 0.019 h-1) (Alves et al., 2008).\nRecently, this strain has been described as being fructophilic (Alves and Paix\u00e3o, 2011). This means it prefers fructose to glucose as a carbon source to grow, growing faster and thus desulfurizing at faster rates in the presence of fructose. Fructophilic pathways were usually associated with yeasts; in fact, until the discovery of this characteristic, lactic bacteria were the only exception (Endo, 2012; Sutterlin, 2010). Since the utilization of microorganisms in industry requires cheap carbon sources to be productive, the fact that this strain is fructophilic opens new possibilities in terms of available carbon sources, allowing the exploration of some fructose rich residues and plants that might both make the process cheaper and more efficient.\n1.14\tScope of the thesis\nThis study tries to take advantage of the recently discovered fructophilic behavior of Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B, to explore new fructose rich alternative carbon sources for the biodesulfurization process. With this in mind three sources were selected for testing, carob pulp, strawberry tree fruit, and Jerusalem artichoke tubers. These were chosen based on their availability, natural characteristics, and high fructose content.\nThe main goals were:\n> To produce liquors and juices with high concentrations of sugar and high percentages of fructose;\n>\tTo optimize them for growth and biodesulfurization with G. alkanivorans strain 1B;\n>\tTo compare the results obtained and select the best alternative carbon source for BDS.\n2.\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1\tChemicals and reagents\nDBT (99 %) was obtained from Acros Organics, 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) was from Sigma, dimethylformamide (DMF) and Na2CO3 (>99 %) were from Riedelde Haen 4-mDBT (96 %) was from Aldrich Chem. Co. BaCl2.2H2O (>99 %) and Sodium sulfate anhydrous (>99 %) were obtained from Merck. CFDA and PI were acquired from Invitrogen. Inulin (90-95 %), from chicory roots, was purchased from Fagron. Jerusalem artichoke tubers were cultivated in our laboratory campus (LNEG, Portugal). Strawberry tree fruits were collected in Castelo Branco, Portugal. Carob pods were obtained from Agrupa, Faro, Portugal. All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available.\n2.2\tMicroorganism and culture media\nThe microorganism used in this study was the bacterium Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B, isolated in our laboratory (Alves et al., 2005). The basal salts medium used for the cultivation/maintenance of this microorganism and further on for the desulfurization and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) tests, was a sulfur-free mineral culture medium (SFM) containing 1.22 g/l NH4Cl, 2.5 g/l KH2PO4, 2.5 g/l Na2HPO4.2H2O, 0.17 g/l MgCl2.6H2O. This medium was supplemented with 0.5 ml/l of Vishniac solution (Vishniac and Santer, 1957), a trace elements solution without sulfur, and its final pH was adjusted to 7.5. In the assays aiming to evaluate the effect of different sulfate concentrations in the ability of G. alkanivorans to desulfurize DBT, the SFM medium was further supplemented with increasing concentrations of a sterile solution of Na2SO4 sterile solution.\nBacterial cultures were performed in shake-flasks incubated at 30 \u00b0C and 150 rpm of agitation in a horizontal incubator (unitron CH-4103, Infors AG, Bottingen, Switzerland). For most of the assays the inoculum was 2 % (v/v), of a culture grown with fructose (5 g/l) as single carbon source and 200 pM DBT as single sulfur source for 72 hours. When using glucose as single carbon source the inoculum was 2 % (v/v) from a culture grown with glucose (5 g/l) and 200 pM DBT for 7 days.\n2.3\tBiodesulfurization assays\nBiodesulfurization (BDS) tests were mostly performed in 500 ml shaken-flasks with 100 ml of total volume. 400 pM of DBT, dissolved in DMF, were added to the sterilized medium to be used as sulfur source.\nThese assays were carried out with a concentration of approximately 25 g/l of reducing sugars, unless otherwise stated. Pure carbon sources such as glucose, sucrose and fructose were dissolved in millipore water in 50 % (w/v) concentrated solutions, which were filter sterilized with a 0.22 pm pore sterile filter before being added to the medium in aseptic conditions.\n2.4\tCarob pulp liquors\nCarob pulp was mixed with deionized water in a 1:1 ratio and left shaking overnight at room temperature. The resulting mixture was taken to a press in order to extract the liquor which was then subjected to an acidic hydrolysis by lowering the liquor's pH to 2 with hydrochloric acid and leaving it at 55 \u00b0C for 48 hours. Afterwards the pH was raised to 7.5 using NaOH and the liquor was filter sterilized.\nDifferent concentrations of sterile BaCl2 were added to the carob pulp liquor in aseptic conditions, shaken vigorously and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for different periods of time. To stop the reaction the liquor was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes (Biofuge 15, Heraeus Sepatech, Germany) (Silva et al., in press) and the pellet discarded. The effects of BaCl2 concentration and time of treatment on sulfate removal from carob pulp liquor were studied according to the statistical design.\nTests were later conducted to evaluate the desulfurization ability of G. alkanivorans using the carob pulp liquors treated with different concentrations of BaCl2. The liquors were diluted in sulfur-free medium in a ratio of 1:6 and used as the single carbon source and 400 pM of DBT were added as a model fuel for BDS.\nG. alkanivorans was then grown with three different carob pulp liquors: untreated, hydrolyzed and treated under optimal conditions, all with 25 g/l of reducing sugars to assess their quality as carbon sources for BDS.\n2.5\tJerusalem artichoke juice\nThe Jerusalem artichoke tubers were washed and dried to remove dirt and other particles before taking them to a juicer. The resulting liquid was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C. At this point, part of the liquid was stored for later usage, while the rest was submitted to an acidic hydrolysis to convert the inulin into fructose and glucose. As with the carob liquor, the juice's pH was lowered to 2 using HCl, and it was left for 48 hours at 55 \u00b0C. Afterwards the pH was adjusted to different values using NaOH tablets, and the juices were filter sterilized. Different concentrations of sterile BaCl2 were then added to the Jerusalem artichoke juices in aseptic conditions, shaken vigorously and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 36 hours. The juice was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes and the pellet discarded. The effects of BaCl2 concentration and pH on sulfate removal from Jerusalem artichoke juice were studied according to the statistical design.\nThe resulting juices were then used as carbon sources with approximately 25 g/l of reducing sugars to determine the treatments effect on both microbial growth and desulfurization.\nThe optimal conditions which resulted from the study of these assays were then applied to both the hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed juice for the desulfurization assays. G.alkanivorans was submitted to four different assays using hydrolyzed, treated and untreated juice and non-hydrolyzed treated and untreated juice as the single carbon source for BDS.\n2.6\tExperimental design\nExperimental distribution for two factors, according to the Doehlert uniform shell design (Doehlert, 1970) was used to produce response surfaces. Fourteen experiments (including replicates) were carried out within an experimental domain, which differed for the carob pulp liquors and the Jerusalem artichoke juices.\nWhen applied to the liquors, BaCl2 (X1) varied between 0 % (w/v) and 0.5 % (w/v) and time (X2) between 6 and 36 hours. When applied to Jerusalem artichoke juice, BaCl2 (X1) concentration varied between 0.125 % (w/v) and 0.625 % (w/v) and pH (X2) between 5 and 9 hours. These interval values were selected after preliminary assays. Coded representation of the factors was used for calculation purposes. The response under study was the sulfate concentration. The model used to express the responses was a second order\n22\npolynomial model: y/=p0+p1X1+p2X2+p12X12+p11X1 +p22X2 where, Yi is the response from experiment i; p are the parameters of the polynomial model; X is the experimental factor level (coded units).\n2.7\tStrawberry tree fruit juice\nStrawberry tree fruits were mashed into a pulp which was centrifuged for 20 min at 10000 rpm at 4\u00b0C (Sigma, 2-16K, Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany). The liquid layer was removed and treated using UV to prevent some contaminants. The juice was then used in BDS assays as the single carbon source with concentration of 10 and 25g/l of reducible sugars.\n2.8\tSimultaneous saccharification and fermentation tests\n2.8.1\tEnzymatic extract\nTalf1 enzymatic extract was produced in our laboratory by the yeast strain Talf1 isolate (Paix\u00e3o et al., 2012). It was cultivated in yeast-malt extract broth medium supplemented with 25 % (v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice. At the end of the growth assay, after 8 days, the culture was centrifuged and the extract was filter sterilized.\n2.8.2\tAssays with inulin and Jerusalem artichoke\nThe assays using inulin were performed with 200 pM DBT with and without the addition of 3 % (v/v) of Talf1 enzymatic extract.10 g/l of inulin from a concentrated solution 20 % (w/v) were also added as the sole carbon source.\nThe assays using Jerusalem artichoke juice were performed with 400 pM DBT with and without the addition of 5 % (v/v) of the same enzymatic extract. Non-hydrolyzed Jerusalem artichoke juice both treated and untreated with BaCl2 was added as single carbon source to obtain approximately 10 g/l of reducing sugars.\n2.9\tAnalytical methods\nThe development of the culture was monitored both by analysis of the absorbance at 600 nm (Thermo Electron Corporation Spectrophotometer, model Genesys 6, Madison, USA) and dry cell weight (DCW) values, by centrifuging the samples 15 minutes at 13000 rpm at room temperature and drying them overnight at 100 \u00b0C.\nSulfate concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Dionex chromatograph ICS-1000 (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with an ASRS - Ultra II suppressor, an AG14A (4 x 50 mm) pre-column and an IONPAC AS14A (4 x 250 mm) column. Sodium carbonate 8 mM was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nThe DBT desulfurization was mostly evaluated by measuring 2-HBP production (the final product of DBT desulfurization). The culture broth was previously acidified with HCl and then the 2-HBP and DBT were extracted from with ethyl acetate during a 5 min vortex. After the phase separation occurred, the organic phase was analyzed by gas-chromatography (GC) in a gas-chromatograph (Model CP9001, Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands) equipped with a flame ionization detector. An Alltech 10 % SE-30 on 80/100 Chromosorb W-HP column was used with nitrogen as the carrier gas. The chromatograph oven start temperature was 190 \u00b0C for 2 minutes and the end temperature 225 \u00b0C maintained, for 2 minutes (heating rate of 6 \u00b0C/min). The injector and detector temperatures were set for 250 and 290 \u00b0C, respectively. In all GC measurements 4-mDBT was used as internal standard to minimize variations.\nGlucose, sucrose and fructose concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography instrumentation (Waters LC1 Module 1 plus, Millford, LA) equipped with a differential refractive index detector. A Waters SugarPak 1 column (6.5 x 300 mm, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used operating at 75 \u00b0C with Ca-EDTA at 50 g/L as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The samples were prepared by centrifuging 15 minutes at 13000 rpm at room temperature. SSF assay samples were left 10 minutes in boiling water, immediately after being collected, in order to inactivate the enzyme activity and prevent further degradation of the inulin molecules.\nFlow cytometric analysis was performed in a FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm and data were analyzed using WinMDI 2.9 software (1993-2000, Joseph Trotter). G. alkanivorans cells were stained with both carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) (green fluorescence, FL1) and Propidium iodide (PI) (red fluorescence, FL3). CFDA is a non-fluorescent permeant substrate that is taken up by the cells and converted inside the cell to a fluorescent substance by esterases, and PI binds to DNA but cannot cross an intact cytoplasmic membrane. Stock solutions of 10 mM CFDA in acetone and 1.5 mM PI in distilled water were prepared and stored at -20 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C, respectively. Cells were centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 10 minutes (Microfuge 18 Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter inc., Palo Alto, Germany), resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and sonicated for 10 seconds. Concentration of the cell suspension was adjusted to approximately 3000 events per second by flow cytometric analysis and the sample total volume set to 1 ml. The cells were then incubated with 5 pl of CFDA for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed and resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer. To complete the double-staining, 1 pl of PI was added and the flow cytometric analysis performed immediately. Instrument settings were selected for the forward and side scatter signals in order to discriminate the cells from background noise and debris. Samples containing Tris-HCl buffer without cells were analyzed to confirm the presence of a constant background noise and confirm that this was not due to unstained cells. For the control assays, healthy (metabolic active) cells were harvested during the exponential phase using fructose as\nthe single carbon source (5 g/l) and 200 ^M of DBT, and after several days of nutrients starvation (stressed cells). Dead cells were obtained by incubating healthy cells) in ethanol at 70% (v/v) for 1 min.\n3.\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1\tFructophilic behavior of Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B\nThere is little work published about the fructophilic behavior of Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B (Alves &amp; Paixao 2011), so it became fundamental to show how this strain reacts with pure carbon sources before moving on to the alternative, more complex ones. In this context, desulfurization assays with strain 1B were carried out to demonstrate and compare its ability to grow and desulfurize using DBT (400pM) as single sulfur source and glucose (25 g/l) or fructose (25 g/l) as sole carbon source in batch cultures.\nFigure 3- Time-course profile of the desulfurization of 400 pM DBT by G. alkanivorans strain 1B with 25 g/l of glucose (a) and fructose (b) as the single carbon source. All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.\nFigure 3 shows the time course of strain 1B cultivation using glucose (Fig. 3a) and fructose (Fig. 3b). When glucose was used as the single carbon source, the maximum cellular growth was obtained after 287 hours, with approximately 11 absorbance units at 600 nm, the complete consumption of the carbon source and a specific maximum growth rate (pmax) of 0.030 h- . When fructose was used, the growth results showed an increase. Maximum cellular growth was obtained after only 117 to 161 hours, reaching more than 12\n-1\nabsorbance units, with about 2 g/l of fructose left, and with a pmax of 0.070 h- . These results clearly show that\nThe desulfurization ability was evaluated in terms of 2-HBP production, the end product of the 4S pathway. As shown in Fig. 3a, when strain 1B was grown on glucose, 2-HBP was already detectable at 23 hours, achieving a maximum value of 306 pM by the end of the growth (312 h). In spite of 400 pM DBT having been consumed, ~25 % of 2-HBP produced was not accounted by GC (similar results have been described before) (Alves et al., 2005). On average 12 pmol of 2-HBP were produced for each gram of consumed sugar. The maximum production rate was 3.2 pM/h and the maximum specific production rate (q2-HBP) was 1.19 pmol g-(DCW) h- . When strain 1B was grown in fructose, 2-HBP was first detected at 24 hours, achieving a maximum value of 393 pM in only 89 h, which translates in a maximum production rate of 31 pM/h and a q2-\n-1 -1\nHBP of 6.565 pmol g- (DCW) h- with approximately 17 pmol of 2-HBP produced for each gram of consumed sugar. Comparing the results observed with both carbon sources tested, it becomes clear that fructose is not only responsible for faster cellular growth rates, but also for faster desulfurization. With this carbon source the 2-HBP final concentration reaches values very close to stoichiometry, and the maximum specific desulfurization rate is 5.5-fold higher than with glucose. These results highlight the fructophilic behavior of G. alkanivorans strain 1B.\n3.2\tAlternative carbon sources\n3.2.1\tSugar concentration\nIn order to lower the costs associated with the BDS process it becomes important to use alternative and cheap carbon sources with a low sulfur concentration. Knowing that this bacterium is fructophilic it's also fundamental to obtain liquors and juices rich in fructose. In this context, several liquors and juices were prepared from carob pulp kibbles, strawberry tree fruits and Jerusalem artichoke tubers, Table 3 shows their sugar and sulfate concentration.\nAll of them revealed great sugar concentrations, with high percentages of fructose. Comparing the untreated liquors or juices, carob pulp liquor (CPL) was the one that presented the highest sugar concentration (339 g/l), but also the lowest percentage of fructose (19 %). Strawberry tree fruit juice (STFJ) had 173 g/l sugars, of which 67 % was fructose, and Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) was the one with the lowest total sugar content (~22 g/l) where ~52 % was fructose.\n3.2.2\tSulfate\nRelatively to the sulfate content, the alternative carbon source with the highest sulfate concentration was JAJ (~451 mg/l), while the other two presented considerably lower values, ~49 mg/l for CPL and ~41 mg/l for STFJ.\n1- This represents the average value of 2-HBP production per hour, without taking into account the dry cell weight. It is useful when comparing production rates for assays in which no dry weight values were calculated.\nTable 3 - Sugar (g/l) and sulfate (mg/l) concentration for the liquors and juices prepared from carob pulp kibbles, strawberry tree fruits and Jerusalem artichoke tubers.\nConcentration\n\tSucrose (g/l)\tGlucose (g/l)\tFructose (g/l)\tTotal Sugars (g/l)\tSulfate (mg/l)\nCarob pulp liquor (CPL)\t174\t100\t65\t339\t49,11\nStrawberry tree fruit juice (STFJ)\t1\t56\t116\t173\t40,54\nJerusalem artichoke juice\t7\t4\t11\t22*\t451,28\n(JAJ)\n*Note: at least 123 g/l of inulin should be added to this value.\n3.3\tDesulfurization inhibition by sulfates\nMany studies have demonstrated that the presence of readily available sources of sulfur leads to an inhibition of the BDS process (Setti et al., 1999, Bahtia and Sharma, 2010). To evaluate the inhibitory effect of sulfate on the ability of G. alkanivorans strain 1B to desulfurize DBT, growth assays were performed in sulfur-free medium which was supplemented with increasing concentrations of sulfate, from 6 to 60 mg/l. Pure fructose (10 g/l) was used in the assays as the carbon source to guarantee that there was no addition of sulfate that may affect the results. Figure 4 shows the effect of different concentrations of sulfate on the time course profiles of G. alkanivorans cell growth (Fig. 4a) and 2-HBP production (Fig. 4b). These results were compared with a control assay in the same conditions where no sulfate was added in order to determine the percentage of desulfurization inhibition (Fig. 4a).\nFig. 4b demonstrates that the increase of sulfate concentration resulted in a decrease of 2-HBP production as well as in a delay in the beginning of the DBT desulfurization. When no sulfate was added (0 mg/l), DBT desulfurization began in the first hours. For a concentration of 6 mg/l of sulfate there was still no 2-HBP production after the first 24 h and the final quantity attained was smaller, presenting already a desulfurization inhibition of 22.4 %. As the concentration of sulfate increased, 2-HBP appeared progressively later and in smaller quantities. With 34 mg/l of sulfate, the production of 2-HBP only began after more than 48 h and in very low concentrations and for 60 mg/l full inhibition occurred since GC analysis did not detect any 2-HBP. This desulfurization inhibition by sulfate has been observed in works studying desulfurization via the 4S metabolic pathway (Ohshiro et al., 1996), the pathway that G. alkanivorans uses for the degradation of DBT. From the desulfurization inhibition results for 72 h, ranging from 22.4 % to 100 % inhibition for the tested\nsulfate concentrations (6 to 60 mg/l), the median inhibitory concentration value (IC50) was interpolated from the curve of the % inhibition against concentration by linear regression. The IC50-72h value estimated for sulfate was 13.6 \u00b1 0.6 mg/l. Mohebali and coworkers in 2008, also studied the effect of sulfate on the DBT desulfurization but with a different Gordonia strain and using a resting cell system reporting that sulfate with concentrations of 14.4 mg/l or higher repressed the desulfurization.\nObserving the time course profile of cell growth, two different growth patterns can be detected (Fig. 4a). When sulfate concentration was residual (6 mg/l of sulfate) there was a longer lag phase and a slower growth rate, similar to the growth assay where DBT was the only sulfur source available. On the other hand, for higher concentrations of sulfate, the growth patterns presented a reduced lag phase and faster growth. The slower growth pattern can be related to the low solubility of DBT in aqueous solution, approximately 0.0061 mM (Seymour et al., 1997), and the need to metabolize it to release the sulfur. As the desulfurization inhibition became higher (for 11 mg/l of sulfate the inhibition was already around 40%) the sulfur source used for cell growth was preferentially the sulfate available in the culture medium, instead of DBT, resulting in a faster growth profile.\nThe overall results showed that even a small concentration of sulfate can translate into a great loss of the desulfurization yield so, the optimization of sulfate removing methods becomes of great importance when\nusing alternative carbon sources.\nFigure 4-Effect of sulfate concentration (mg/l) on G. alkanivorans strain 1B growth (a) and DBT desulfurization ability in terms of 2-HBP production (b). All the values are means of at least three replicates. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.\n3.4\tRemoval of sulfate\nIn order to remove the sulfate present in the liquors and juices, it was necessary to optimize the BaCl2 precipitation method. In this context, after determining the initial sulfate concentrations in the carbon sources (Table 3), some wide range preliminary tests were performed using CPL to determine the basic conditions for sulfate removal using BaCl2.\nTable 4 presents the results from these preliminary assays. The analysis of these results shows that low temperatures drastically reduce sulfate precipitation, even after extended periods of time. The removal of sulfate was similar either at 30\u00b0C or at 50 \u00b0C, and even with or without agitation. Thus, further precipitation assays were held at 30\u00b0C with no agitation.\nTable 4- Preliminary results of different conditions for sulfate removal using BaCl2 on carob pulp liquor.\nSample\tBaCl2 (%w/v)\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\tTime\tSulfates mg/l\nCPL\t0,25\t4\t30 min\t40,798\nCPL\t0,25\t4\t1h\t39,664\nCPL\t0,25\t4\t3h\t46,323\nCPL\t0,25\t4\t5h\t37,762\nCPL\t0,25\t4\t17h\t51,705\nCPL\t1\t4\t17h\t13,761\nCPL\t1\t30\t17h\t9,191\nCPL with\t1\t30\t17h\t8,856\nagitation\t\t\t\t\nCPL\t1\t50\t17h\t9,291\nOther exploratory studies were also developed with the other carbon sources. In the case of the strawberry tree fruit juice, it reacted to even low concentrations of BaCl2 and almost immediately solidified turning into a sort of jelly, which made impossible to use it for further growth assays. So, the methods of BaCl2 sulfate removal were useless for this carbon source.\nIn order to optimize the conditions for sulfate removal by BaCl2 two experimental designs were developed: one for CPL and another for JAJ.\n3.4.1\tOptimization of sulfate removal from carob pulp liquor using a statistical experimental design\nThe effects of BaCl2 concentration and exposure time on sulfate removal from carob pulp liquor were studied. Table 5 shows the results of experiments following a surface response methodology according to the Doehlert distribution for two factors (Doehlert., 1970). The data obtained from the application of the experimental design were further used for regression analysis and the polynomial model-derived parameters (p0 to p22) are displayed in Table 6. The p parameters of the polynomial models (when using coded units varying from -1 to +1) utilized to estimate the responses have precise meanings: p0 represents the analyzed response in the center of the experimental domain; the magnitude of pl and p2 indicates the importance of the respective\nfactors (concentration and time, respectively) on the responses; the interaction parameter, p12, indicates how the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other factor. The values of p11 and p22 determine how the response surface folds downward (negative values) or upward (positive values) quadratically, more or less rapidly depending on the magnitude of the absolute value.\nAnalyzing the data in Table 5 considering the exposure time of 21h, the addition of growing concentrations of BaCl2 to the carob pulp liquors results in successive decreases of sulfate concentration (tests 1 through 6). The addition of 0.25 % and 0.50 % of BaCl2 decreases in average 17.2 % and 66.0 % of the sulfate in the broth, respectively. Within this data set sulfate decreased linearly with the addition of BaCl2. The rate of decrease was of 64.8 mg/l of sulfate per BaCl2 percent unit. Similarly, considering the exposure time of about 34 h, the increasing BaCl2 concentrations, 0.125 % and 0.375 %, allowed sulfate precipitation of 7.6 % and\n65.8\t%, respectively. An exposure time of 8 h for the same BaCl2 concentrations showed the achievement of\n5.5\t% and 41.5 % of sulfate precipitation levels, respectively. Thus, these results indicate that a BaCl2 concentration of 0.125 % is not enough to obtain significant sulfate precipitation, independently of the exposure time.\nTable 5- Experimental design and the obtained response (residual sulfate concentration in carob pulp liquor) throughout the domain under study.

For BaCl2 concentration of 0.375 %, the increase of the exposure time from 8 h to 34 h (see tests 7, 8, 11 and 12 in\nConsidering the Table 5, the data suggests an important role of the amount of BaCl2 in the reduction of sulfate concentration in carob pulp liquors as compared with exposure time. The relative importance of BaCl2 concentration and the exposure time towards sulfate concentration is given by the value of p parameters in the regression equation (Table 6). The value of p1 for sulfates is fivefold higher than p2 meaning that the time of exposure is fivefold less influential to the final sulfate concentration than the amount of BaCl2 used in the process. The relative difference of p values affects the results of the experiments shown in Table 6. The presence of greater amounts of BaCl2 allows a more reduced time in the process of sulfate precipitation but the correct level of each factor is paramount in the definition of the optimal factor values. In this sense the magnitude of p12 (interaction between BaCl2 concentration and time) provides information about how the two factors, together, contribute to the response. p12 is higher than p2 meaning that it is important to carefully define a value for each factor. The response surface shown in Figure 5 displays the variation of sulfate concentration within the experimental domain.\nTable 6- Parameters of the polynomial models representing the studied responses.pO, response at the center of the experimental domain; pi and p2, parameters of the factors 1 and 2, respectively; pi2, parameter of the interaction of the factors 1 and 2; pi 1 and p22, self-interaction parameters of the factors 1 and 2, respectively).\n\t\tModel\tSulfate\n\t\tpo\t40.67\n$2&lt;D aS E S ra Q. a> \u25a0u o 2\t\tpi\t-18.51\n\t\tp2\t-3.73\n\t\tp12\t-6.29\n\t\tpii\t-7.76\n\t\tp22\t-5.87\nModel validation\t\tEffectiveness of the parameters\t44.26\n\tCO CD H\u2014&lt;CD - .C O CO i_L\tSignificance level (%)\tF(5,8), a=0.01\n\t\tLack of fit\t24.83\n\t\tSignificance level (%)\tF(1,7), a=0.01\nR2\t\t(coefficient of multiple determination)\t0.97\nThe importance of BaCl2 on the response is expressed by the vertical lines on the response surface: a small variation of BaCl2 concentration produces a response in the sulfate concentration.

Thus, to obtain a carob pulp liquor with minimal\nFigure 5- Response surface (mg/l sulfate) for the factors time of treatment (6-36 hours) and BaCl2 concentration (0-0.5 %), showing the cross-influence in sulfate concentration. (Note: coded representation of the factors instead of experimental domain was used for calculation purposes).\n3.4.1.1\tAnalysis of experimental data\nStatistical validation of the polynomial equations was made by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Deming and Morgan, 1987). The adequacy of the models to fit the sets of data was performed using two statistical tests: (i) the F-test for the effectiveness of the factors which detects whether the source of variance, included in the residuals, is due to the inadequacy of the models to reproduce experimental data; and (ii) the F-test for the lack of fit, that is performed in order to detect if the origin of the variance was due to experimental error. Table 6 shows the Fisher variation ratios and levels of confidence evaluated for each F-test. F-test for the effectiveness of the factors applied to sulfate concentration showed a level of confidence at which the null hypothesis (H0) can be rejected of 0.01 %. Thus, with a good level of confidence it can be assumed that a significant amount of variance in the data has been represented by the factors in the models, i.e. the factors, as they appear in the model, do have an effect upon the responses analyzed.\nThe F-ratio for the lack of fit also seems to be highly significant for sulfate concentration, as the null hypothesis can be rejected with a level of confidence of 0.01 %. In these conditions, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted, which means that the lack of perfect prediction of the models is explained by the experimental error. All the models fit well the sets of data. Model analysis by the coefficient of multiple\n2\ndetermination (R ) was also performed (Table 6). This coefficient shows that only a limited amount of the sum of squares corrected for the mean is accounted for by the residuals (3 %).\n3.4.1.2\tDesulfurization evaluation using carob pulp liquor treated with BaCl2\nThe carob pulp liquors, obtained from the seven different conditions of the experimental design (see Table 3), were all tested to evaluate how the sulfate removal affects the DBT desulfurization by G. alkanivorans strain 1B (Figure 6). The production of 2-HBP was observed only in three of these conditions, namely: 0.5 % of BaCl2 for 21 h, and 0.375 % of BaCl2 for 8 h and 34 h. From these, 0.5 % of BaCl2 for 21 h was the most efficient condition producing the higher quantity of 2-HBP (237 pM), which support the results of the experimental design (Fig. 5). For lower concentrations of BaCl2 (0.125 %, 0.25 %), independently of the time tested, no desulfurization occurred (Fig. 6).\nThese results showed that most of the conditions were unable to remove the sulfate to levels that allowed desulfurization. However, based on the sulfate levels measured by HPLC and the IC50 calculated previously (13.6 mg/l), there should have been some desulfurization in all the assays. This may indicate the presence of other sulfur sources, besides sulfate, that may affect desulfurization of DBT. As previously stated, when using agro-industrial materials as carbon sources for biodesulfurization these problems should be expected, since there is little control over the amount of sulfur rich compounds present in these residues, such as amino acids that have been proved to inhibit desulfurization (Mohebali et al., 2008). This experimental design highlights that 0.5 % of BaCl2 and a time of exposure of 21 h were adequate conditions for the sulfate removal from carob pulp liquor regarding its effective utilization in BDS, but in order to achieve zero sulfates it becomes\nG. alkanivorans strain 1B in terms of 2-HBP production. All the values are means of at least three replicates, and the error bars indicate standard deviations\n3.4.2\tOptimization of sulfate removal from Jerusalem artichoke juice using a statistical experimental design\nThe sulfur contents of JAJ are almost ten times greater than those found on CPL so, in order to remove such amounts, it became necessary to further optimize the treatment. Based on the maximum precipitation conditions determined for CPL, 36 hours were determined as the fixed period of exposure, since longer exposure times would become impractical. It was then necessary to experiment with another parameter, in this case pH, since several studies have shown that pH levels have great influence on the formation and precipitation of barium sulfate (Rudie et al., 2006).\nThe effect of BaCl2 concentration and the juice's pH on sulfate removal from Jerusalem artichoke was studied using the same methods as for CPL (Table 5). Like previously observed, the addition of greater amounts of BaCl2 reduces the final concentration of sulfate (tests 1 through 6). At pH 7, the rate of sulfate reduction is\n383.8\tmg/l per each percent unit of BaCl2.\nTable 7- Experimental design and the obtained response (residual sulfate concentration in Jerusalem artichoke juice) throughout the domain under study. Experiments performed in duplicated for statistical analysis.\nTest\tDesign\t\tResponses\n\tBaCl2 (% w/v)\tPH\tSulfate (mg/l)\n1\t0.375\t7\t34.05\n2\t0.375\t7\t24.73\n3\t0.63\t7\t3.95\n4\t0.63\t7\t4.84\n5\t0.125\t7\t198.54\n6\t0.125\t7\t198.81\n7\t0.5\t8.73\t10.00\n8\t0.5\t8.73\t11.70\n9\t0.25\t5.27\t192.03\n10\t0.25\t5.27\t191.23\n11\t0.5\t5.27\t26.26\n12\t0.5\t5.27\t31.02\n13\t0.25\t8.73\t59.21\n14\t0.25\t8.73\t59.02\nWhen the concentration of BaCl2 is doubled at pH 5.27 (tests 9 - 12) and pH 7 (tests 1 - 4), the amount of final sulfate concentration drops a value between 6.7 and 7.1 times. At pH 8.73 (tests 7, 8, 13 and 14) the final sulfate concentration drops 5.5 times indicating a less efficient activity at this pH.\npH also shows a relevant effect on the responses. For low concentrations of BaCl2 (tests 9, 10, 13 and 14) increasing pH from 5.27 to 8.73 decreases the sulfate 3.2-fold. For higher concentrations of BaCl2 (tests 7, 8, 11 and 12) the same range of pH change leads to a 2.6-fold drop in sulfate.\nThe relative importance of the factors on the responses is well represented by the values of the p factors in the linear models. In fact, the contribution of BaCl2 concentration (p1 = - 99.97) towards sulfate reduction is twice as important as pH (p2 = -43.39) contribution. The interaction of both factors (p12 = 66.23) shows a positive input in the response (final sulfate concentration) in opposition with the trend of the individual factors. This indicates a lower efficiency of high concentrations BaCl2 at highly alkaline pH, as demonstrated in tests 7, 8, 13 and 14.\nFigure 7- Response surface for the factors pH (5 - 9) and BaCl2 concentration (0.125 - 0.625 %), showing the cross-influence in sulfate (Note: coded representation of the factors instead of experimental domain was used for calculation purposes).\nTable 8- Parameters of the polynomial models representing the studied responses. |30, response at the center of the experimental domain; pi and |32, parameters of the factors 1 and 2, respectively; pi 2, parameter of the interaction of the factors 1 and 2; pi 1 and p22, self-interaction parameters of the factors 1 and 2, respectively).\n\tModel\tSulfate\n\tp0\t29.41\nModel parameters\tpl\t-99.97\n\tP2\t-43.39\n\tp12\t66.23\n\tpll\t72.13\n\tp22\t33.49\nModel validation (Fischer test)\tEffectiveness of the parameters\t887.22\n\tSignificance level (%), F(5,8) Lack of fit Significance level (%), F(1,7)\ta= 0.01 11.79 a= 0.025\nR2\t(coefficient of multiple determination)\t0.97\nThe response surface in Figure 7 shows the variation of sulfate concentration within the limits of the experimental domain. The vertical lines show that the relative weight of BaCl2 on the concentration of sulfate is more influent than pH. In fact, a small variation of BaCl2 concentration produces a great response in the sulfate concentration. The lower quadrants show that small concentrations of BaCl2 seem to be less effective at acidic pH. In accordance, the lower left quadrant shows the highest values of sulfate concentration. This\nvalue decreases as both pH and BaCl2 increase to obtain a minimum value of sulfates at pH = 7 (code 0) and BaCl2 = 0.5 - 0.55 % (code 0.5 - 0.7). The response surface profile is consistent with the values of p1 and p2 for sulfate (Table 8); however, the rate of concentration changes more rapidly when approaching the lower sulfate level.\n3.4.2.1\tAnalysis of experimental data\nStatistical validation was performed as stated for CPL in section 3.4.1.1. Table 8 shows the Fisher variation ratios and levels of confidence evaluated for each F-test.\nF-test for the effectiveness of the factors applied to sulfate concentration showed a level of confidence of 0.01 %, at which the null hypothesis (H0) can be rejected Thus, with a good level of confidence, it can be assumed that a significant amount of variance in the data has been represented by the factors in the models, i.e. the factors, as they appear in the model, do have an effect upon the responses analyzed.\nThe F-ratio for the lack of fit also seems to be highly significant for sulfate concentration, as the null hypothesis can be rejected with a level of confidence of 0.025 %. In these conditions, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted. The lack of perfect prediction of the models is explained by the experimental error. All the models fit well the sets of data.\n2\nModel analysis by the coefficient of multiple determination (R ) was also performed (Table 8). This coefficient shows that only a limited amount of the sum of squares corrected for the mean is accounted for by the residuals (1 %).\n3.4.2.2\tDesulfurization evaluation using Jerusalem artichoke juice treated with BaCl2\nThe seven juices resulting from the different test conditions were used as carbon sources to test the effects of the treatments on the actual BDS process by G. alkanivorans strain 1B. The consumption of DBT and production of 2-HBP occurred on all of the conditions as shown on Figure 8 (a and b). Analyzing the consumption of DBT, the treatment with 0.125 % BaCl2, pH 7 proved to be the less efficient, with 154 pM of remaining DBT by 144 hours followed by both the acidic treatments 0.25 and 0.5 % BaCl2 (83 and 34 pM respectively). The most efficient were clearly the alkaline treatments, 0.25 and 0.5 % BaCl2, which by 72 hours had 18 and 43 pM DBT, respectively. Production-wise, the treatment with 0.125 % BaCl2, pH 7 was once again the worst, with a maximum of only 181 pM 2-HBP, followed by both acidic treatments with 264 pM and the treatment with 0.25 % pH 8.73 with 275 pM. The most efficient treatments were the remaining three, with very similar values, the treatment with 0.5 % BaCl2, pH 8.73 achieved a maximum of 353 pM and the treatments with 0.375 and 0.65 %, pH 7 reached 353 pM and 328 pM, respectively. The obtained results weren't entirely in accordance with the results of the experimental design. The lowest BDS results belonged to a juice with a weaker treatment with a high concentration of sulfate, which is expected; however, there should be a bigger difference between both acidic treatments since one has almost 200 mg/l of sulfate and the other ~30 mg/l. Moreover, taking into account both fastest the DBT consumption and the maximum 2-HBP production, the treatment with the best potential was BaCl2 0.5 % pH 8,3, and not the one with the lowest\nconcentration influencing the BDS process, this is once again the result of using complex carbon sources.\n400\na\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\ns;' -\n'*'\u2022% '*\u2022\n\\S-\n0\n400\n350\nDM57 Bad; 025% pM 7 BdCI; 0 375% 0K873 BaCI; 0 5%\ns- 7 a \u00a1.- b\npH 8.73\t025%\n300\nf 250\nA\nQ.\nCD\n200\n150\n100\n60 80 100 Time (hours)\n120\n140\n160\ns\n0\n\n\nFigure 8- Effect of the seven treatments of Jerusalem artichoke juice, with BaCl2, in the DBT desulfurization process by G. alkanivorans strain 1B in terms of DBT consumption (a) and 2-HBp production (b). All the values are means of at least three replicates, and the error bars indicate standard deviations.\nThe results also seem to be in disagreement with the ones obtained for sulfates inhibition. According to them there should be no desulfurization when using the juices with higher concentration of sulfates (tests 5, 6, 9, 10, 13 14). However, the sugar concentration in the juices was more than twice the one used on the inhibition assays; this resulted in much higher biomass production, which could account for a larger need of sulfur, thus explaining the lower inhibitory effect.\nThe analysis of all the data on this experimental design shows that a concentration of zero sulfate can be achieved with 0.5 - 0.55 % (w/v) BaCl2 at pH 7. However analysis of the actual BDS shows better results when using alkaline pH, thus the optimal condition was determined to be 0.5% (w/v) BaCl2 at a pH of 8.73.\nDuring this treatment an accumulation of barium sulfates can occur, which can constitute an environmental problem in a large scale BDS application; however, this drawback can become an economic advantage because barium sulfates can be recovered at end of the process and be used for further applications, such as\n3.5\tDesulfurization assays using the alternative carbon sources\n3.5.1\tCarob Pulp Liquor\nCarob pulp liquor is commonly used in several bioprocesses because of its high sugar concentration. Due to its relatively low sulfate concentration and high fructose content it also becomes a potentially interesting carbon source for biodesulfurization with G. alkanivorans strain 1B.\nTo test effectiveness of this liquor for BDS, batch assays were conducted using the liquor to obtain 25 g/l total concentration of glucose, fructose and sucrose with 400 pM initial DBT. Figure 9a represents cellular growth and 2-HBP production by the strain 1B during this assay. Maximum optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was 4.9\n-1\nat 144 h and the pmax was 0.1099 h- . In terms of desulfurization, 2-HBP production started at around 20 h, achieving its maximum of 50 pM by 93 h. The maximum production rate was of 1.30 pM/h, while the q2-HBP\n-1 -1\nwas of 0.43 pmol g-1 (DCW) h-1. This reduced level of production reveals the abundance of sulfate or other easy access sulfur sources. As Fig. 9a shows a great part of the biomass was formed without the production of 2-HBP. In fact, by 15 h, OD600 was already at 2.18, almost half of the maximum OD600 (4.9), with no evidence of desulfurization. These results accentuate the need for optimization of the liquor.\nThe next step was to submit the liquor to an acidic hydrolysis, with the intention of converting the sucrose (51 % of the sugar content) into glucose and fructose. As a result, there was an increase of glucose and fructose, which reached 40 %, however there was also a loss in the amount of total sugars (dropping from 339 to 299 g/l). This hydrolysis should contribute to an increase of the specific rates, since the cell no longer needs to spend energy and nutrients on the enzymatic pathway to metabolize this sugar. Once again, this liquor was used in assays as the single carbon source to obtain 25 g/l total concentration of glucose and fructose with 400 pM initial DBT. Its potential for BDS was tested and the results for both cellular growth and 2-HBP production are shown in Figure 9b. The behavior of the culture was very similar to the non-hydrolyzed version. The maximum OD600 of 4.9 was achieved after 98 h, with no visible lag phase and a pmax of 0.0916 h-\n1\n. This slight increase of the growth rate could be the result of the easier access to the carbon source. Even so this treatment had a greater positive effect on desulfurization. 2-HBP reached detectable concentrations by 18 h, with a maximum value of 84 pM by 66h and its maximum production rate was of 3.85 pM/h with a q2-HBP of\n-1 -1\n1.57 pmol g- (DCW) h- . This was a significant increase with the maximum specific production rate raising more than 3-fold. However, like before, the sulfate or other easy access sulfur sources could be limiting the BDS abilities of the strain.\nThe final step was to remove the sulfate from the liquor using BaCl2, to prevent some inhibition of the BDS process. To do this, the optimal conditions determined by experimental design were applied to the hydrolyzed liquor. The treatment was very effective in removing the sulfates, reducing their concentration from 49 to 0\nhydrolyzed CPL (b) and hydrolyzed CPL treated with BaCl2 in optimal conditions as the single carbon source. All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.\nGrowth assays were conducted in batch mode with the treated liquor as the single carbon source (25 g/l of fructose and glucose) and 400 pM of DBT. The results for cellular growth and 2-HBP production are shown on Figure 9c. After 92 hours the culture reached a maximum OD600 of 4.9 and its pmax was of 0.0595 h- . This reduction of the pmax could be explained by the absence of easy access sulfur sources, which forces the bacteria to use the DBT, thus spending resources in the metabolic pathway, which would otherwise be used for cellular growth. Analysis of the desulfurization activity reveals that the production of 2-HBP began in the first 17 hours, and its maximum of 117 pM was obtained after only 70 h. Maximum production rate was of 3.27\n-1 -1\npM/h with a q2-HBP of 1.56 pmol g- (DCW) h- , and for every gram of consumed sugar an average of 8 pmol of 2-HBP were produced.\nWhen comparing the three liquors it becomes clear that the treatments were successful and led to the improvement of the BDS process. While it is true that both the non-hydrolyzed and hydrolyzed liquor presented greater growth rates, the analysis of Figure 9 will prove that \u201coptimal\u201d liquor is the best for the BDS process. When grown with this liquor, the strain had a lower maximum growth rate and its 2-HBP production rates were roughly the same as the hydrolyzed liquor. However since there were no easy access sulfur sources in the medium, desulfurization started much earlier, and by 17 h 2-HBP concentration was already 10 pM, which is 30% higher than that obtained for the hydrolyzed liquor one hour later. This resulted in a final 2-HBP concentration ~28 % higher and thus in a more effective desulfurization.\nThe results obtained with the liquor were, however, less promising than those with fructose. In all of them the growth stopped before the exhaustion of the carbon source, remaining 4, 9.5 and 10.9 g/l in the broth with pure, hydrolyzed and \u201coptimal\u201d liquors, respectively, without depleting the sulfur source and with no lag phase to indicate any inhibitory effect. Multiple approaches were used to try to solve this problem, such as: i) extraction of the liquor at 4 \u00b0C, to limit the presence of inhibitors; ii) use of other carob kibbles, since these were from a new batch and the results obtained in the experimental design were somewhat better; iii) use of activated charcoal, as a filter to remove possible inhibitors. However the final result remained the same.\nThe explanation could be related to the variable abundance of weak short chain lipophilic acids in CPL, such as acetic acid or butyric acid in the carob pods (Berna et all., 1997). These acids even in small concentrations are known to cause inhibition of bacterial growth. When in their undissociated form, these acids present a great solubility on the cell membrane, penetrating into the cytoplasm where they dissociate and release protons, causing a toxic effect, by lowering the internal cellular pH (Booth 1985, Roseiro 1991). As a response, the cells promote a detoxification mechanism based on ATPase inversion, which start to function as proton pumps, spending ATP to expel protons (Warth 1988). On a small scale this should have almost no practical effect on the culture. However, as the number of proton pumps rises, the amount of available ATP decreases and cellular metabolism lowers, which could even cause an abrupt stop of the growth. The acid percentage which is in its undissociated form is dependent on the pH of the culture. At values close to 7.5 these shouldn\u2019t represent much danger. However, as the pH drops and approaches the pKa the weak acids become extensively undissociated and cause the referred toxic effects on the cells (Esgalhado et al., 1996).\nFigure 10- Flow cytometric analyses of G. alkanivorans stained simultaneously with CFDA and PI, grown on DBT (i, ii, iii) as the sulfur source. Analyzed cells were at different physiological states: healthy exponential growing cells (i), cells submitted to starvation for several days (ii) and dead cells (iii). Three subpopulations can be differentiated: (A) viable cells, (B) stressed or injured cells and (C) dead cells\nFlow cytometry was used to evaluate the physiological response of G. alkanivorans cells to the stress growth conditions generated by the presence of alternative carbon sources in the medium. Figure 10 shows a series of controls for G. alkanivorans strain 1B using 5 g/l of fructose as carbon source and 200 pM of DBT as sulfur source, stained with both CFDA and PI. The obtained results allowed the differentiation of four subpopulations: viable cells (A) (CFDA +, PI-), stressed or injured cells (B) (CFDA+, PI+), cells with permeabilised cytoplasmic membranes(C) (CFDA -, PI+), and intact cells with compromised enzymatic activity (D) (CFDA-, PI-). Exponential growing cells (i) were stained mainly with CFDA (78.5 %), some were stained with PI (3 %),or with both dyes (9.7 %) and 8.8 % were unstained. In the starved culture (ii) the proportion of PI+ cells (CFDA- and CFDA+) was much higher (64.2 %) compared to the exponential growing cells density plot (i), indicating, as expected, a more compromised culture. Ethanol-killed cells (iii) only showed a small percentage of unstained cells 5 % and cells with fluorescence emission for PI 94.4 % (PI+ cells)\nFigure 11 shows the flow cytometric analyses of cells taken during the evolution of a strain 1B culture grown with carob pulp liquor as the carbon source (25 g/l total sugars) and 400 pM of DBT as the sulfur source. Fig. 11a, depicts the density plot of cells taken from the middle of the exponential phase, showing a large percentage of healthy cells (42.0 %) and almost no permeabilised cells (4.2 %), as expected. However, from the observation of Fig. 11b, concerning cells taken from the stationary phase, it was revealed that there were almost no events in the upper right quadrant (injured cells) (1.1 %), and the proportion of permeabilised cells was only 13.2 %,suggesting that cell permeability did not occur, at least in a high extension, in this early stationary phase. However, a massive increase in the percentage of cells in the lower left quadrant (D) (68.6 %) was observed. This could represent an increase of uncompromised metabolically inactive cells, which wouldn't be stained with CFDA or PI. If so, these results would be in accordance with the effects of the\nlipophilic acids, thus explaining the unpredicted stop of the culture. At the start of the growth assay, with pH close to 7.5, most of the weak acids are in dissociated form. However, as the growth progresses, the external\npH lowers to values below 5.5 which are much closer to the pKa of the weak acids, resulting in high\nconcentrations of the undissociated forms. This in turn\nwould lead to reduction of the growth rate and an\neventual stop of the bacterial growth.\nFigure 11- Flow cytometric analyses of G. alkanivorans stained simultaneously with CFDA and PI, grown on DBT as the sulfur source and\nCPL, 25 g/l total sugars, as the carbon source. The cells were harvested during the exponential phase (A) and stationary phase (B). Results were obtained in duplicate and each analyzed in triplicate\n3.5.2\tStrawberry tree fruit\nAt first, strawberry tree fruit seemed like a potentially viable alternative carbon source. It presented high sugar content, with a great percentage of fructose, and relatively small sulfate concentration (Table 3). Nonetheless it already had one problem, the impossibility of sulfates removal with BaCl2. The STFJ was used as carbon source in a batch assay to obtain 25 g/l total concentration of glucose, fructose and sucrose with 400 pM initial DBT. Figure 12 represents the growth and 2-HBP production by the strain 1B.\nAs the Figure 12 shows, the bacteria were unable to sustain a long time growth curve. Even though the growth achieves a pmax of 0.087 h, it had an abrupt stop at 24 hours. During this period there was no production of detectable 2-HBP, nor was the carbon source fully consumed, with 16 g/l remaining. This sudden stop of the growth can be explained by an acidic choc that probably kills the majority of the cell population. In fact, at 24 h the registered pH was 3.02, this is well below the limit the bacteria can handle (approximately 5). Moreover tests done with STFJ showed that it has a strange reaction to variations of pH. When pH is above 7, it reacts in the same way as with BaCl2, turning into a jelly. When pH is falls below 6, is rapidly lowers to values close to 3. Immediately after the inoculation, the medium's pH was around 7.5, but as the bacterial culture entered the exponential phase, the pH dropped to values close to 6 at which time the reported effect of STFJ acted suddenly lowering the pH to 3.\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120 i\n1009;\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nco X\nI CM\nFigure 12- Time-course of the desulfurization of 400 pM DBT by G. alkanivorans strain 1B with 25 g/l of sugars from STFJ as the single carbon source. All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.\nA flow cytometry analysis of a similar growth confirms the abrupt death of most of the cells with a pH of 3.01. Figure 13a shows the physiological states of G. alkanivorans cells during an assay with 400 pM DBT, as the sulfur source, and 25 g/l total sugars, from STFJ. After 16 hours of growth, there was a low proportion of injured cells (3.7 %), around 9 % of cells with permeabilised membranes, 15 % of active cells, and a high proportion of metabolically inactive cells (71.5 %), which, as previously noted, is a known response to acidic stress.\nAt 40 hours (Figure 13b), after the culture stopped growing, approximately 85 % of the cells were either injured (19.1 %) or permeabilised (65.6 %) and only 5.7 % remained active and healthy, supporting the hypothesis that the extremely low pH was responsible for their damage.\nIn order to minimize the effects of the STFJ on the pH, a new desulfurization assay was conducted using a smaller concentration of the juice, the equivalent of 10 g/l of the analyzed sugars, maintaining the DBT concentration of 400 pM. The results are shown on the Figure 14.\nFigure 13- Flow cytometric analyses of G. alkanivorans stained simultaneously with CFDA and PI, grown on DBT as the sulfur source and STFJ with 25 g/l of total sugars. Analyzed cells were harvested during the exponential phase (A) and stationary phase (B).

All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.\nThis time the bacteria were able to grow in a regular manner, achieving a maximum OD600 of 2.6 at 64 hours and a pmax of 0.0523 h- with the carbon source fully consumed by the end of the growth. Analyzing the desulfurization during the first hours of growth there was no 2-HBP production, which is a symptom of the sulfate present in the medium. Only after 22 hours there was an appearance of 2-HBP, reaching its top value\n-1 -of 146 pM by 94 hours. Maximum production rate was of 7.38 pM/h and the q2-HBP was of 5 pmol g- (DCW) h-\n1\n. DBT wasn't fully consumed remaining more than 31 % (125 pM) of the original concentration, which is expected since carbon is limiting, however the bacteria produced on average 15 pmol of 2-HBP for each gram of consumed sugar.\nEven though the strain 1B was able to use strawberry tree fruit to desulfurize, it presents several problems which would make using it on an industrial level somewhat complicated, becoming a less attractive option for the BDS process.\n3.5.3\tJerusalem artichoke\nJerusalem artichoke juice is, amongst the three sources, the one with greatest potential to grow the strain 1B, because, once hydrolyzed, it has the highest levels of fructose. However it is also the one in which treatments are most needed in for it order to be used in BDS.\nUntreated, non-hydrolyzed juice was used as the single carbon source in a DBT biodesulfurization assay, as to obtain approximately 25 g/l of total reducing sugars in the growth medium. As Figure 15a shows, there was some cellular growth, with a maximum OD600 of 4.72 after 39 hours, and a pmax of 0.0546 h- . During this time there was also no production of 2-HBP. These results were expected, since the bacteria cannot use inulin as a carbon source, and all the other sugars were in small concentrations (approximately 4g/l at the beginning), being fully consumed by 47 hours. Desulfurization was also not expected since the sulfate present in the juice (451 mg/l) was more than enough for this level of cellular growth.\nThe next step was of course to promote the acidic hydrolysis of the inulin in the juice in order to make the fructose available to the bacteria. This treatment caused a great increase of the sugars content in JAJ (from ~22 to 145 g/l) with fructose concentration reaching 115 g/l (~80 % of the total). Fig. 15b shows the progress of a BDS assay using 400 pM DBT and approximately 25 g/l of glucose and fructose from the hydrolyzed juice, as the only carbon source. Unlike the previous assay, this time there was a greater cellular growth, a\n-1\nmaximum OD600 was obtained at 91 h with a value of 13.15 and the pmax was of 0.0816 h- , with total sugar consumption by the end of the growth. The results of the desulfurization, however, remained: by the end of the growth no detectable 2-HBP had been produced, which was expected since there were still large quantities of sulfate in the juice, enough to even sustain the growth of the culture to these levels.\nIn order to make the BDS process possible, it became necessary to remove the sulfate present in the juices, so the optimal precipitation conditions (0.5 % BaCl2, 8.73 pH), determined through the experimental design assays, were applied to both juices (hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed). The treatment greatly reduced sulfates concentration from 451 to 11 mg/l. Non-hydrolyzed JAJ treated with BaCl2 shows a significant decrease on total sugars (from 22 to 4 g/l); contrary to the observed in the hydrolyzed JAJ treated with BaCl2 which revealed no substantial alteration on sugar levels (from 140 to 145 g/l total sugars).\nThe two resulting juices were then used as carbon sources for desulfurization of DBT (400 pM) by the strain 1B. The sugar concentrations were approximately 25 g/l of fructose and glucose for the hydrolyzed juice, and the equivalent taking into account the inulin for the non-hydrolyzed. The results are shown on Fig. 15c and d. Both assays revealed the production of 2-HBP, however their growth curves were very different. The bacteria grown using non-hydrolyzed juice, with approximately 1 g/l of consumable sugars, achieved a maximum\n-1\nOD600 of only 2.40 at 66 h and their pmax was of 0.0428 h- . 2-HBP production was already registered at 18\nhours reaching a maximum concentration of 43 pM by the end of the growth. The maximum production rate was of 1.74 pM/h and the q2-HBP was 1.23 pmol g- (DCW) h- . These results show that the treatment was very effective, since even this small growth resulted in the production of 2-HBP, meaning that the remaining sulfate was so residual it wasn't enough to sustain this small need for sulfur, and thus no inhibition of the BDS process was observed. When grown with the treated and hydrolyzed juice (Fig. 15d), the bacteria reached a\n-1\nmaximum OD600 of 15 after 96 h, presenting a pmax of 0.06 h- , with total consumption of the carbon source by the end of the growth. Production of 2-HBP was also registered at 18 hours, but its maximum concentration was much higher, reaching approximately 400 pM of 2-HBP between 73 and 96 hours, which resulted from total consumption of the DBT. The culture's maximum production rate was of 28.2 pM/h and its q2-HBp was\n-1 -1\n5.06 pmol g- (DCW) h- . The consumption of each gram of sugar resulted on an average production of 16 pmol of 2-HBP.\nA flow cytometry analysis was also conducted for a BDS assay in similar conditions. The results in Figure 16 show the culture's state in the middle of exponential phase.\nFigure 15- Time-course of the desulfurization of 400 pM DBT by G. alkanivorans strain 1B with 25 g/l total sugars of JAJ (a), hydrolyzed JAJ (b), JAJ treated with BaCl2 in optimal conditions (c) and hydrolyzed JAJ treated with BaCl2 in optimal conditions (d) as the single carbon source. All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.\n2-HBP (pM)\t2-HBP (pM)\nIt can be seen on Figure 16 that 55.6% of G. alkanivorans cells were healthy, and 1.2 % were permeabilised, a result very similar to the control obtained for fructose (Fig. 10i).\nFigure 16- Flow cytometric analyses of G. alkanivorans stained simultaneously with CFDA and PI, grown on DBT as the sulfur source and JAJ, hydrolyzed and treated with BaCl2, as the carbon source, with 25 g/l total sugars. Analyzed cells were harvested during the exponential phase. Results were obtained in duplicate and each analyzed in triplicate\nBy comparing the results obtained with the four juices, it becomes clear that the treatments were very successful. The hydrolysis led to an increase in maximum biomass, from 3.52 and 1.52 g/l DCW to 7.84 and 7.94 g/l DCW (treated and untreated, respectively). The treatment with BaCl2 led to the production of 2-HBP which was unachievable in the untreated juices. A decrease of the pmax was observed as a result of the treatment, from 0.0546 h-1 to 0.0428 h-1 in the non-hydrolyzed juices and from 0.0816 h-1 to 0.06 h-1 in the hydrolyzed ones. This might be explained by the presence of the sulfates, since they represent an easy access sulfur source, allowing for a smaller energy cost when comparing with DBT.\nAfter its treatments, JAJ presents itself as a good potential carbon source, allowing high 2-HBP production rates without major inhibitors or complications.\n3.5.4\tSimultaneous saccharification and fermentation\n3.5.4.1\tInulin\nAn alternative to the acidic hydrolysis of the inulin present in the Jerusalem artichoke would be to use enzymes to degrade it into fructose and glucose in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). This process could bring some advantages, such as a gradual release of the monosaccharaides, preventing a possible inhibitory effect caused by excess carbon. Or a greater specificity, since the scope of its action is limited to the inulin molecules, unlike the acidic hydrolysis which can affect multiple compounds.\nIn this context, DBT desulfurization assays with G. alkanivorans strain 1B were carried out to screen the ability of this strain to grow and desulfurize DBT using commercial inulin (10 g/l) and JAJ (10 g/l reducing sugars) as the sole carbon source, with and without the presence of inulinases (Talf 1 crude enzymatic extract (Paixao et al., 2012)). Figure 17 shows the time course profile displaying the bacterial growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans strain 1B in batch cultures, with 10 g/l of inulin as the only carbon source and 200 pM of DBT as sulfur source, without the presence of inulinases (Fig. 17a) and supplemented with 3 % (v/v) Talf1 enzymatic extract (Fig. 17b).\n17a). A low growth, with a pmax of 0.02 h- , occurred due to the presence of residual fermentable sugars in the commercial inulin, approximately 1 g/l of reducing sugars (sucrose, fructose and glucose). This growth was not sufficient for the bacterium to produce 2-HBP from DBT, because the strain used only the residual readily bioavailable sulfur compounds present in the commercial inulin, to grow due to the scarce carbon source available.\nWhen 3 % of Talf1 enzymatic extract was added in a SSF process with the same desulfurization conditions, G. alkanivorans strain 1B was able to grow and desulfurize (Fig. 17b), presenting a maximum OD600 of 2.8 by\n-1 -1\n38 hours, a pmax of 0.08 h- , better than that obtained with fructose (0.070 h-). 2-HBP was first detected at 15 hours, achieving a top value of 139 pM by 42 hours. Maximum production rate was of 6.74 pM/h and a q2-HBP was of 5.88 pmol g-1 (DCW) h-1 (lower than fructose at 25g/l, 6.565 pmol g-1 (DCW) h-1). In this case the residual sulfur compounds present in the inulin were consumed before the available sugars, therefore the bacteria was forced to desulfurize DBT to obtain the necessary sulfur for the growth. In the first hours of the assay there was an accumulation of hydrolyzed monosaccharaides which were then completely consumed during the bacterial growth (Fig. 17b). These results demonstrated that even in temperature and pH\nFigure 17- Growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans in batch cultures with 10 g/l of inulin as the only carbon source and 200 pM of DBT as the sulfur source, without the presence of inulinases (a) and supplemented with 3% Talf1 enzymatic extract (b). All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.\n3.5.4.2\tJerusalem artichoke\nOnce Talf1 enzymatic extract efficiently hydrolyzed pure inulin within BDS conditions, allowing the growth and desulfurization to occur, a second set of assays were performed testing the Jerusalem artichoke juice. Figure 18 shows the time course profile displaying the bacterial growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans strain 1B in batch cultures with untreated non-hydrolyzed JAJ (10 g/l reducing sugars), as the sole carbon source, and 400 pM of DBT, as sulfur source, without the presence of inulinases (Fig. 18a) and supplemented with 5 % (v/v) Talf1 enzymatic extract (Fig. 18b). A higher concentration of DBT was added in this set of assays, to guarantee that the sugars were all consumed without any sulfur limitation. A higher concentration of enzymatic extract (5 %) was also employed, to guarantee the efficient hydrolysis of JAJ, which may contain inulin fibers harder to hydrolyze than the commercial inulin.\nAs observed in the assay with pure inulin (Fig. 17a), there was no desulfurization and almost no bacterial growth in the batch cultures without the addition of inulinases (Fig. 18a), because strain 1B cannot metabolize\n-1\ninulin. A low growth, with a pmax of 0.03 h- and a maximum OD600 of 2.66 at 72 hours, occurred due to the presence of readily available fermentable sugars (~3 g/l) and sulfates in the natural juice (Fig. 18a). When 5 % of Talf1 enzymatic extract was added to the bacterial culture, both growth and desulfurization were observed (Fig. 16b). Again, there was an accumulation of hydrolyzed monosaccharaides in the first hours,\n-1\nwhich were completely consumed during the bacterial growth. The pmax was of 0.05 h- with a maximum OD600 of 8.06 at 42 hours and the 2-HBP maximum production rate was of 6.64 pM/h (Fig. 18b) with its production starting between 24 and 42 hours and reaching a maximum of 123 pM at 65 hours.\nFigure 18- Growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans in batch cultures in diluted Jerusalem artichoke juice (10 g/l of reducing sugars) as the only carbon source and 400 |iM of DBT as the sulfur source, without the presence of inulinases (a) and supplemented with 5% Talf1 enzymatic extract (b).\nAs previously stated, the Jerusalem artichoke juice is very rich in sulfate that can inhibit the desulfurization and consequently decrease the 2-HBP production. So, the next step was to test the juice treated with BaCl2. Figure 19 shows the time course profile displaying the bacterial growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans strain 1B in batch cultures with non-hydrolyzed Jerusalem artichoke juice treated with BaCl2 (10 g/l reducing sugars) as the only carbon source and 400 pM of DBT as sulfur source, supplemented with 5% Talfl enzymatic extract.\nOnce again, when cultivated with 5 % of Talfl enzymatic extract, both growth and desulfurization were observed (Fig. 19). Accumulation of hydrolyzed monosaccharaides occurred in the first hours, being completely consumed during the course of the bacterial growth. The pmax was 0.1288 h- with a maximum OD600 of 6.18 at 66 hours. Analyzing the 2-HBP production, it was first detected at 25 h, achieved a maximum\n-1\nof 279 pM by 66 h and the maximum production rate was 16,8 pM/h while the q2-HBP was of 8.33 pmol g--1\n(DCW) h- , translating into the production of 28 pmol of 2-HBP for each gram of consumed sugar.\nComparing both the growth rate and 2-HBP production between treated and untreated juices, it becomes clear that the treatment was effective: pmax was increased 2.6 times and maximum 2-HBP production rate went up\n2.5\ttimes. Even comparing with the pure source, the commercial inulin, these results proved to be much better. pmax was 1.6 times higher, maximum 2-HBP production was improved 2.5 times and maximum specific production rate went up 1.4 times. This increase in comparison with the pure source can be explained by the presence of extra nutrients other than carbon, in which the Jerusalem artichoke juice is rich. These nutrients could have supplemented the minimum medium used for the BDS assays contributing to a better performance\nFigure 3- Growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans in batch cultures in diluted JAJ, hydrolyzed and treated with BaCl2 (10 g/l of reducing sugars), as the only carbon source and 400 PM of DBT as the sulfur source, supplemented with 5% Talf1 enzymatic extract All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.\nStudies with enzymatic extracts for degradation of complex carbon sources are rare on the BDS field. A separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process was already applied successfully in BDS studies with this bacterium, testing hydrolyzates of recycled paper sludge (Alves et al 2008). That seems to be the only existing study, and this is the first time that a SSF process was applied, opening a new focus of research.\n4.\tCONCLUSIONS\nThe main goal of this work was to test different types of agro-industrial materials and assess the biodesulfurization ability by G. alkanivorans strain 1B viewing the selection and the optimization of BDS process for the most promising alternative carbon source.\nIn this context, and previously knowing that G. alkanivorans strain 1B is a fructophilic bacterium, fructose rich materials were selected, namely: carob pulp, strawberry tree fruits and Jerusalem artichoke tubers. These materials were used to produce sugar rich liquors and juices, which were optimized through acidic hydrolysis and treatments with BaCl2 for sulfate removal and further tested for DBT-desulfurization. The results obtained with the different liquors and juices prepared indicate that all the three raw materials have the potential to be used as alternative carbon sources in BDS processes by strain 1B.\nHowever, this study showed that Jerusalem artichoke juice was the most promising alternative carbon source for both growth and DBT-desulfurization with the G. alkanivorans strain 1B. Using the optimized JAJ as the sole carbon source, no inhibitory effects were observed, having been achieved normal bacterial growth results, with the complete consumption of the carbon source and the 400 pM of DBT. The simple treatments applied to JAJ (sulfate removal with BaCl2 and acidic hydrolysis) were sufficient to allow desulfurization with levels very close to those obtained with commercial fructose, either in terms of: maximum 2-HBP produced (400 pM, achieved in similar times for both), 2-HBP production rate (31 pM/h for fructose and 28 pM/h for JAJ) and maximum 2-HBP production per gram of sugar consumed (17 pmol/g sugar for fructose and 16 pmol/g sugar for JAJ). The major difference seems to be that JAJ promotes greater biomass formation, reaching a maximum OD600 of 15, within 96 h, against a maximum OD600 of 12, within 117 to 161 h, for fructose. This fact\n- -1\ncontributed to a slightly decrease of the q2-HBP in the juice, 5.06 pmol g-1 (DCW) h- , which in fructose was\n- -1\n6.565 pmol g-1 (DCW) h- . Furthermore, the application of Talf1 inulinases to JAJ in a SSF process, as an alternative approach to the acidic hydrolysis treatment, allowed the achievement of remarkable results, surpassing those obtained not only with the acid hydrolyzed JAJ but even with commercial fructose. The results from JAJ in a SSF with enzymes showed a pmax 1.84 times higher than with fructose and 2.15 times higher than with acid hydrolyzed JAJ, a q2-HBP 1.27 times higher for fructose and 1.65 times higher for the other JAJ, and a ratio of 2-HBP production per gram of sugar consumed 1.63 times higher for fructose and 1.74 times higher for the acid hydrolyzed JAJ.\nJerusalem artichoke may not be a residue of any particular industry, but the fact that it can grow on poor soils, exposed to very different climates, ranging from the very hot to the very cold, and is even resistant to contaminants of the soil and parasites, makes it very easy and cheap to produce, being available anywhere around the world. Moreover, since its sugar content is mostly inulin, it is less likely to be contaminated, being more easily stored.\nTo sum up, the Jerusalem artichoke juice is an excellent alternative carbon source that can prove to be a very valuable asset for the further acceptance of the biodesulfurization as an alternative or complement to the sulfur removal from crude oil. The promising results obtained in this study open a new focus of research\n5.\tFUTURE WORK\nFuture work will include continuous culture assays viewing a further optimization of desulfurization kinetics using the Jerusalem artichoke juice optimized as carbon source. Then it could be interesting to test model fuels to evaluate the desulfurization ability in the presence of multiple simultaneous compounds, such as the derivatives of DBT and benzothiophene. And an ultimate goal would be to conduct biodesulfurization assays on actual crude oil or gasoline/diesel, to determine the G. alkanivorans strain 1B potential to desulfurize in conditions usually found at industrial level.\n6.\tBIBLIOGRAPHY\n1.\tAbadias, M., Teixid\u00f3, N., Usall, J. &amp; Vi\u00f1as, I.
