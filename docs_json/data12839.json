Current transpiration radiometers rely on steady state temperature \nmeasurements in a porous element crossed by a know gas mass flow. As a \nconsequence of the porous sensing element\u2019s intrinsically high thermal inertia, \nthe instrument\u2019s time constant is in the order of several seconds. The proposed \ninstrument preserves established advantages of transpiration radiometers while \nincorporating additional features that broaden its applicability range. The most \nimportant developments are a significant reduction of the instrument\u2019s response \ntime and the possibility of separating and measuring the convective and \nradiative components of the heat flux. These objectives are achieved through \nthe analysis of the instrument\u2019s transient response, a pulsed gas flow being \nused to induce the transient behavior. \n \n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nTABLE OF

The relevance of \n\nheat flux as a thermodynamic design parameter is discussed. The \n\nthesis\u2019s contribution, objectives and structure are also discussed and its \n\nintegration in a continuous line of development is addressed in order to \n\nadequately explain the framework in which this work took place. A \n\nreview of the available methods to measure heat flux, along with a \n\ndiscussion of their relative merits and major advantages and \n\ndisadvantages, is presented. The contribution of the present work is \n\nestablished and discussed by comparison. \n\n \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe standard interpretation of heat flux defines it as the energy in transit owing to a \n\ntemperature difference per unit cross-sectional area, normal to the flux direction. \n\nAlthough there are no devices that can measure energy and hence heat or heat flux \n\ndirectly, the effects of energy in transit can be monitored and the heat flux inferred. \n\nHeat flux in a thermodynamic system typically varies in both space and time, reflecting \n\nthe state of the system. Knowledge of heat flux properties in a thermodynamic system \n\nenables its assessment in terms of efficiency, safety and availability, embodying an \n\nimportant design, control and diagnostic parameter for most operational thermal \n\nsystems. \n\n Heat transfer can occur by means of conduction, convection and radiation, \n\neither as independent or as combined phenomena. The objective of measuring heat \n\ntransfer is the quantification of the heat flux. In a solid, heat flux will occur due to \n\nconduction alone, but at a solid/fluid interface (a case of practical significance to \n\nengineers), the resulting heat transfer will occur owing to at least two of these three \n\nmodes. Most heat flux sensors measure the total heat flux at the interface or surface, \n\nwith important consequences when comparisons are made between experimental results \n\nand theory or computational fluid dynamics, or correlations of experimental results are \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nfor example used to calibrate a heat flux sensor. The separation of the relative \n\ncontributions of convection and radiation to the total heat flux, often referred to as \n\nheat flux partitioning, is generally the most troublesome issue. A radiation correction \n\ncan in most cases be easily applied to an experimental configuration, providing the \n\nsurface temperature and radiative properties of the experimental domain are known \n\n[Childs et al. 1999]. Extensive studies are available regarding applications where heat \n\nflux partitioning must be carried out [Blanchat et al. 2009]. \n\n Radiation heat flux is an especially important parameter as far as high \n\ntemperature applications are concerned, namely in systems such as boilers, furnaces or \n\ncombustion chambers. These systems place severe constraints upon instrumentation \n\ndue to the harsh physical conditions, in the form of high temperatures and various \n\naggressive processes that include dust, soot or highly reactive chemical species. Such \n\nsystems are also usually characterized by the occurrence of fouling processes which can \n\nseverely, if not completely, restrict the application of most types of sensors. As much as \n\npossible, they must therefore be robust, reliable and able to avoid or minimize the \n\nfouling problem on the sensors themselves. \n\nPhysical methods available for the purpose of heat flux measurement are usually \n\nbased on the monitoring of temperatures. However, while temperature measurements \n\nare common and well accepted, heat flux measurements are often given lesser \n\nconsideration because they are less intuitive: temperature is one of the fundamental \n\nproperties of a substance and can be determined by human senses, whereas heat flux is \n\na derived quantity that is not easily sensed. How and where the thermal energy goes is \n\noften equally (or more) important than temperature levels. Optimizing the thermal \n\nenergy transfer in many systems is crucial to their performance, rendering sensors that \n\ncan be used to directly sense heat flux extremely important and fully justifying the line \n\nof work that eventually led to the present work. \n\nMost methods for measuring heat flux are based on temperature measurements \n\non or close to the surface of a solid material, usually involving the insertion of a device \n\neither onto or into the surface, which can cause both physical and thermal disruptions. \n\nAs a result, good measurements must aim at minimizing the disruption caused by the \n\npresence of the sensor. It is particularly important to understand the thermal \n\ndisruption caused by the sensor because it cannot be readily visualized and because all \n\nheat flux sensors have a temperature change associated to the measurement. \n\nConsequently, a wise selection of the sensor type and operating range is important for \n\ngood heat flux measurements. Of no lesser importance are the reliability and the \n\nrobustness of the sensor, so these factors should also be considered when selecting a \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nparticular instrument, and must guide the development of any new sensor, as described \n\nhere. \n\n1.2 Framework and Relevance \n\nThe desirability for heat flux measurement techniques and instruments as good as \n\npossible is rather self evident and is undoubtedly the driving force behind the \n\ncontinuing development both in this field and in others related to it, by taking \n\nadvantage of the existing instruments, namely diagnostic and control systems. \n\nHowever, in this particular case, another reason was at least as important and \n\njustifies to some extent some of the approaches and decisions that shaped the overall \n\ndeveloped work. The present thesis can obviously be taken solely at face value, but it \n\ntakes a somewhat broader significance when looked upon from the wider point of view \n\nof the whole line of work that eventually led to the present transpiration radiometer \n\nand that came about through a continuous line of development that can be said to \n\nhave begun in the early 1990s, as detailed below, and that relies on some principles \n\nproposed in the 1970s. \n\n In most studies involving radiometers the output of the instrument has to be \n\nobtained in steady-state conditions, for which a variety of theoretical models are \n\navailable. However, reliable or accurate steady-state data are usually not enough within \n\nthe framework of advanced diagnostic systems, since for certain measurement \n\napplications it is also very important to record dynamic characteristics, such as the \n\ntransient response of the instrument. If the results are to be obtained in transient \n\nconditions, its response time must be considerably shorter. This is one of the main \n\ndriving forces behind the present work. \n\nThe blow-off effect that the transpiration principle implies is central to the desired \n\nperformance of such an instrument. Indeed, besides having a cooling effect on the \n\nsensing element, the transpiration gas is intended both to keep the sensing element \n\nclean during operation by deflecting incoming particles and also, just as importantly, to \n\nenable the separation of the radiative and convective components of the total heat flux. \n\nThis can be achieved bearing in mind that the transpiration gas mass flow rate will \n\ndictate conditions on the sensing element\u2019s surface exposed to the incoming heat flux. A \n\ncritical transpiration gas mass flow rate will define the following two operating modes: \n\n\u2022 For a transpiration gas mass flow greater than the critical value the external \n\nstream boundary layer is destroyed and only the radiative component of the \n\ntotal heat flux is received by the sensing element; \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n\u2022 For a transpiration gas mass flow smaller than the critical value the boundary \n\nlayer is not destroyed and the sensing element receives both to the radiative \n\nand the convective components of the total heat flux. This feature enables the \n\nseparate measurement of the convective and radiative components since the \n\ntotal heat flux is:  \n \n\n \ntot rad convq q q= + , (1.1) \n\n \n\nthe radiative heat flux being measured directly and the convective heat flux \n\nbeing calculated from the relationship above. \n\nEven from a purely operational point of view, radiation heat flux measurement \n\nis arguably the most important part of the problem, since the high temperature levels \n\noften found in industrial furnaces dramatically reduce the relative importance of \n\nconvective heat flux in overall energy balance analyses. Nevertheless, it cannot be \n\nignored since a variety of advanced diagnostic systems rely on total, radiative and \n\nconvective heat fluxes as input parameters [Calisto et al. 2008], although the \n\ndevelopment of radiometers and total heat flux meters has always been stronger than \n\nthe development of selective heat flux sensors for industrial applications. \n\nAs will be discussed further below, transpiration radiometers are interesting for \n\nsituations where other techniques are too complex and expensive to be transferred to \n\ncurrent industrial applications, mainly due to the high temperature, aggressive \n\nenvironments involved. Previous work along these principles was undertaken in the \n\nearly 1970s [Moffat et al. 1971]. The basic principle already was to blow air through a \n\nporous plug (essentially a porous disk mounted on a cylindrical water-cooled copper \n\nbody) which composed the exposed surface of the gauge.  \n\nThe air flow had several purposes, the most important of which was to literally \n\nblow-off any fluid boundary layer from the surface of the gauge if the flow was \n\nsufficiently high, resulting in the elimination of convection. Secondly, the flow provided \n\nthe temperature difference measured by the gauge, the output signal being proportional \n\nto the difference between porous disk and inlet air temperatures. The output signal was \n\nmonitored by a differential thermocouple, one of the junctions being attached to the \n\nback face of the porous disk (on its axis) and the junction set in the transpiration gas \n\nstream just behind the disk. The thermal radiation flux was proportional to the signal \n\nobtained with the differential thermocouple, i.e., to the temperature difference between \n\nthe porous medium and the transpiration stream. The porous disk temperature was \n\nitself a function of the flow rate and specific heat of the air, as well as of the net \n\nradiation heat flux to the disk. The balance between gas cooling and radiation heating \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\ndetermined the disk temperature, although a calibration procedure was necessary to \n\nestablish the efficiency of the heat transfer process between the gas and the disk. A \n\nsecond thermocouple could be attached to the disk edge, allowing the use of the \n\ninstrument as a Gardon gauge if the gas stream was switched off.  \n\nGardon or circular foil gauges were among the first heat flux gauges originally \n\ndeveloped to measure thermal radiation flux [Gardon 1953], with their applicability \n\nlater extended to convection measurements [Gardon 1960]. The Gardon gauge (also \n\nknown as the asymptotic calorimeter) consists of a hollow cylinder of one material \n\n(which acts as a heat sink) with a thin foil of a second material attached to one end. \n\nThe radial temperature difference between the centre of the disc and its edge is a \n\nfunction of the heat flux to the disk and of the radial temperature profile. \n\nMore closely related to the work discussed here was a similar but slightly \n\ndifferent radiometer for operation in high-ash boilers [Brajuskovic and Afgan 1991, \n\nBrajuskovic et al. 1991]. Basic differences were the fact that instead of going through \n\nthe plug, the air was directed through slots around a solid plug, and the sensing \n\nelement was replaced by a Gardon-type heat flux sensor. Indeed, the air flow kept the \n\nash particles from reaching the heat flux gauge and took away the thermal energy as in \n\nother transpiration gauges, and heat transfer was radial trough the plug as in a circular \n\nfoil gauge. The heat flux was proportional to the temperature difference measured \n\nbetween the centre and the edge of the plug. Due to their theoretical ability to perform \n\nheat flux partitioning and to evaluate deposit thicknesses, these radiometers had the \n\npotential to serve as a basis of online furnace and boiler diagnostic systems. \n\nBesides these developments albeit not entirely separate from them, a particular \n\nline of development led directly to the work described here. It relied on the same \n\nprinciple of blowing off the convective component of the total heat flux, reverting to \n\nthe option of having gas crossing the sensitive element [Afgan and Leontiev 1995]. This \n\ninstrument used a thick (namely when compared with Gardon foils) porous disk as \n\nsensing element, replacing the thin net used in earlier instruments. The thicker porous \n\ndisc had the advantage of collecting the totality of the thermal radiation incident on \n\nthe surface, no thermal radiation escaping to the inner side of the gauge body due to \n\nthe non-existent transmissivity of the porous element. In addition, the temperature \n\nmeasurements were made at the front and back surfaces of the porous disk, enabling \n\nthe determination of the incoming radiation by an energy balance to the porous disk.  \n\nThe work described here can be said to be in direct continuity from further \n\ndevelopment of this configuration, namely by the supervisor of this thesis as part of his \n\nown PhD, during the course of which a fully operational transpiration heat flux meter \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nwas developed, built and tested in industrial conditions [Martins 1998], its formulation, \n\nspecifications and performance being discussed in associated publications [Martins et al. \n\n1998, Martins et al. 2000]. Any of these references makes clear that a rugged and \n\nreliable radiometer was obtained, these qualities being extensively proved in full-scale \n\ntests carried out in a thermoelectric coal-burning facility. Fouling was indeed shown to \n\nbe avoided thanks to the transpiration air flow. However, somewhat large response \n\ntimes (up to 5 s) were observed.  \n\nWhile being perfectly adequate for a wide range of applications, namely those in \n\nwhich the instrument was tested, the integration of such an instrument in equipment or \n\nsystems that exhibit strongly time-dependant behaviours could be hindered by such \n\ncomparatively high response times. The instrument was also rather bulky, especially \n\ndue to the necessary water refrigeration system, which could also render it less \n\nattractive for some applications. Hardware such as gas turbines (especially for \n\npropulsion applications) readily comes to mind as examples of systems that require \n\nfast-response instruments, due to the sheer speed at which it operates and which in \n\nturn renders slow-responding sensors inappropriate while having restrictions regarding \n\nthe bulk and weight of all subsystems, including sensors. \n\nThe application range of that version of the instrument was subsequently shown \n\nto be potentially extended in order to effectively perform heat flux partitioning (which \n\nother work suggested by failed to effectively implement) and to obtain a faster response \n\nversion using a transient operational mode. The path towards these conclusions was \n\nsimilar, since a MSc dissertation was first presented [Hit 2004], having the same \n\nsupervisor as the one presented here, followed by subsequent publications [Martins et \n\nal. 2006a, Martins et al. 2006b], potential applications in diagnostic systems also being \n\ndiscussed [Calisto et al. 2008]. \n\n1.3 Heat Flux Measurement: Literature Review \n\nAs mentioned earlier, temperature measurements are common and well accepted but \n\nheat flux measurements are often given lesser consideration because they are less \n\nintuitive. Consequently, sensors that can be used to directly sense heat flux can be \n\nextremely important and the present chapter is essentially devoted to the review and \n\ndiscussion of available techniques for thermal radiation and convection flux \n\nmeasurements.  If radiation and convection are to be measured separately in situations \n\nwhere both occur simultaneously (arguably the majority of applications), some form of \n\nheat flux partitioning must be performed. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nThere is a large variety of available heat flux measurement techniques, which can be \n\narranged into several categories. One such possible classification broadly divides these \n\ntechniques into the following four categories: \n\n\u2022 Spatial temperature gradient techniques \u2013 the heat flux across a spatial \n\ndistance can be determined by measuring temperatures at discrete locations and \n\nrelating to the temperature gradient and the material properties; \n\n\u2022 Temporal temperature change techniques \u2013 a heat balance is applied to a \n\nparticular region of the sensor and the temporal measurement of a temperature \n\nis related to the heat flux; \n\n\u2022 Energy supply or removal techniques \u2013 a heater or cooler is used to supply or \n\nremove energy from a system and a heat balance used to relate the temperature \n\nmeasured to the heat flux; \n\n\u2022 Mass transfer analogy techniques \u2013 measuring mass transfer instead of heat \n\ntransfer and using an analogy to infer heat transfer. \n\nDue to the often conflicting requirements for sensitivity, robustness, size and cost, \n\nany given single heat flux measurement technique is hardly suitable for all applications, \n\nthe trend being indeed for increased diversity. \n\nAs mentioned above, temperature measurements are paramount in most heat flux \n\nmeasurement techniques. A large number of journal articles and chapters in \n\ninstrumentation books have been written over the years reviewing available heat flux \n\nmeasurement techniques. Some well-established references (in the sense that they have \n\nbeen widely cited) cover general principles [Goldstein 1970, Kostkowski and Burns \n\n1970, Baker and Ryder 1975, Eckert and Goldstein 1976, Thompson and Emrich 1981, \n\nAtkinson et al. 1983, Goldstein and Chiang 1985, Childs et al. 1999] while others focus \n\non specific methods or specific applications, ranging from radiation measurements \n\n[Edwards 1970], transient techniques [Scott 1970], high-temperature measurements in \n\ngases [Grey 1970], high-speed aerodynamics [Grey 1970, Neumann et al. 1988, Neumann \n\n1989], combustion applications [Butler et al. 1994, Arai et al. 1996, Chander and Ray \n\n2005] to fluidised bed reactors [Saxena et al. 1989] and power engineering machines and \n\ninstallations [Jaremkiewicz et al. 2009]. An extensive review covering a wide spectrum \n\nof methods, with particular emphasis to those oriented to convective heat flux \n\nmeasurement, is available [Diller et al. 1993], along with more recent and equally wide-\n\nranging references to which the present review is also indebted [Moffat 1988, Moffat \n\n1990, Moffat 1998, Childs et al. 1999]. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nOne unifying factor is that most methods require accurate temperature \n\nmeasurements to be made somewhere as the key to good heat transfer measurements. \n\nMany well-established and often cited books and articles have been written covering \n\ndifferent aspects of temperature measurement [Baker and Ryder 1975, Eckert and \n\nGoldstein 1976, McGee 1988, Childs et al. 2000], while others cover specific aspects \n\nsuch as very high temperature measurements [Neuer et al. 2001]. \n\n1.3.1 Spatial Temperature Gradient Techniques \n\nDifferential Layer and Planar Thermal Gradient Devices \n\nThe simplest heat flux sensor is the so-called layered gauge, consisting of a layer of a \n\nmaterial with known thermal conductivity and well-defined thickness, together with \n\ntwo temperature measurement devices located on two opposite faces of the gauge. The \n\ngauge is designed so that the heat flux is one-dimensional in the direction defined by \n\nthe two thermocouples. By measuring the temperature difference under these \n\nconditions, all the data required to determine the heat flux are available. Actually, \n\nunder these specific conditions, Fourier\u2019s law can be written as follows, where all the \n\nquantities are known with the exception of the heat flux and the temperature \n\ndistribution is linear: \n\n \n\n '' 1 2\n1 2\n\nd\n\ndx\nT kT Tk k Tq\nx Lx x\n\n?\n= ? = ? = ? ?\n\n?\n, (1.2) \n\n \n\nwhere T1 and T2 are measured temperatures, x1 and x2 are measurement locations \n\nresulting in sensor thickness L, which along with thermal conductivity k are not usually \n\nknown with sufficient accuracy for any particular sensor to avoid direct calibration of \n\neach sensor. The heat transfer rate (in W) is \n''\n\nx x\nq Aq=  is and A is the heat transfer \n\narea. An adhesive layer may also be required between the sensor and surface to \n\nsecurely attach the sensor, which adds an additional thermal resistance and increases \n\nthe thermal disruption. Temperature measurements on the sensor and on the \n\nsurrounding undisturbed material are recommended to quantify this disruption. A \n\ndetailed analysis of the performance of this gauge was presented by [Hager 1965]. \n\nSimilar gauges were later proposed taking advantage from the development of materials \n\nscience and new production technologies [Godefroy et al. 1990, Hager et al. 1991]. \n\nThe selection of a temperature-measuring technique for determining the \n\ndifference in temperature depends on the need to provide reasonable sensitivity and \n\nsignal output for the range of heat flux under consideration. The temperature difference \n\ncan be measured by a variety of methods, most commonly by means of thermocouples. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nThese have the advantage of generating their own voltage output, which is a function \n\nof the temperature difference between their two junctions. They can thus be connected \n\nin series to form a thermopile that amplifies the output from a given temperature \n\ndifference, the voltage output E being: \n\n \n\n \nT\n\nE NS T= ? , (1.3) \n \n\nwhere N is the number of thermocouple junction pairs and ST is the Seebeck coefficient \n\nor thermoelectric sensitivity of the junction, calculated as the absolute value of the \n\ndifference between the Seebeck coefficient of each metal and usually expressed in volts \n\nper degree centigrade. The corresponding sensitivity of the heat flux sensor is: \n\n \n\n T\nS ''\n\nNS LE\nS\n\nkq\n= = .  (1.4) \n\n \n\nAlthough sensitivity is determined in practice from a direct calibration, the last \n\nmember of the previous equation can be used to determine the effects of different \n\nparameters for design purposes. The transient response is a function of the separation \n\ndistance and the material\u2019s thermal diffusivity ?. A one-dimensional analysis gave the \n\ntime required for a 98% response as [Hager 1965]: \n\n \n\n \n21.5L\n\nt\n?\n\n= .  (1.5) \n\n \n\nFrom the equations above it can be seen that while sensitivity increases with \n\njunction separation L, the time response increases proportionally to the square of this \n\ndistance. The use of a thicker layer and/or a lower thermal conductivity material \n\nincreases the gauge sensitivity since a relatively large temperature difference is \n\nobtained, leading to lower heat flux levels. However, these design options also increase \n\nthe thermal inertia of the gauge and consequently its time response, one of the major \n\ndrawbacks in the design of these gauges. It should be noted that the temperature \n\ndifference can be determined by means of thermometers, thermistors, or resistance \n\ntemperature devices (RTDs), as well as by thermal radiation-based devices and optical \n\nmethods, besides thermocouples and thermopiles. Thermocouple-based measurement is \n\nwell known [Heitor and Moreira 1993], but research continues regarding better signal \n\nprocessing procedures, especially in transient measurements [Frankel et al. 2008]. The \n\npossibility of using intrinsic thermocouples rather than standard soldered ones [Genix et \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nal. 2009] or the use of non-standard semiconductor thermoelectric modules, as opposed \n\nto conventional thermocouples [Ploteau et al. 2007], is also being pursued. \n\nOne of the first reported heat flux sensors made use of this technique, with \n\nthermometers placed on either side of a cork floor to determine the heat loss in a food \n\nprocessing plant [Hencky 1915]. Some forms of thermopile sensors have found \n\nwidespread application, leading to commercial production, and several are listed below \n\nas examples. There is a variety of gauge configurations, with the basic configuration \n\nillustrated in Figure 1.1. The most simple is merely a thermal resistance layer, to which \n\na thermopile with several hundred junctions is fitted over areas in the range of some \n\nhundred square centimetres, with the possibility of using flexible material, such as \n\nmylar or kapton in order to allow for some surface conformability. Gauges made with \n\nthese materials lead to uses at relatively low temperatures (around 500\u00b0C) and \n\nconvection heat transfer studies [van Dorth et al. 1983], although applications such as \n\nfluidised bed combustion chambers [Kumada et al. 1990] and fouling in combustion \n\nchambers [Marner et al. 1989] have been reported. The major limitations of this \n\ntechnique, when thermal radiation has to be measured in high temperature harsh \n\nenvironments, are the problems related with the control of the gauge temperature, the \n\ncleanness of the sensing element and the separation of the convection component of the \n\ntotal heat flux. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 - Basic layered gauge principle and thermopile for differential temperature \n\nmeasurement [Diller et al. 1993]. \n\n \n\nAnother successful, widespread and commercially available design using a \n\nthermopile consists of thin pieces of two types of metal foil, alternately wrapped around \n\na thin plastic (once again kapton) sheet and welded on either side to form \n\nthermocouple junctions, as illustrated in Figure 1.2 [Ortolano and Hines 1983], with a \n\nseparate thermocouple included to provide a measure of the sensor temperature. Such \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nsensors are typically limited to measuring temperatures below 250\u00b0C and heat fluxes \n\nlower than 100 kWm-2, with response times of approximately 20 ms. Sensors with \n\nhigher sensitivity are made with semiconductor thermocouple materials for geothermal \n\napplications, with operating temperatures of up to 1250\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 - Thermopile heat flux sensor [Ortolano and Hines 1983]. \n\n \n\nDifferent manufacturing techniques (namely thin-film sputtering techniques) \n\nresult in very thin sensors with low physical and thermal disruption, which when used \n\ntogether with (and for which the use of) high-temperature thermocouples, allow \n\noperating temperatures to exceed 800\u00b0C, being best suited for heat flux values above   \n\n1 kWm-2, with no practical upper limit. The sensor\u2019s thinness allows the thermal \n\nresponse time to be less than 10 \u00b5s, giving a good frequency response, often well above \n\n1 kHz [Hager et al. 1993, Holmberg and Diller 1995]. A similar sensor design makes use \n\nof screen printing techniques of conductive inks and a large number of thermocouple \n\npairs (up to 10,000), yielding sufficiently high sensitivities to measure heat fluxes as low \n\nas 0.1 Wm-2, thermal time constants of about 1 s and upper temperature limits of \n\napproximately 150\u00b0C [Terrel 1996]. Sensitivities better than 40 mVW-1cm-2 have been \n\nobtained with similar sensors [Langley et al. 1999], the trend being towards more \n\nsensitive sensors with micromachined components [Escriba et al. 2005]. \n\nAnother common technique for measuring the temperature difference across the \n\nthermal resistance layer is to wrap wire and then plate one side of it with a different \n\nmetal (usually wire with copper plating), resulting in a wire-wound sensor looking \n\nsimilar to the sensor shown in Figure 1.2. The difference is that the constantan wire is \n\ncontinuous all around the sensor, so it does not form discrete thermocouple junctions. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nNonetheless, a high sensitivity can be achieved because of the hundreds of windings on \n\nthe sensors, although at the expense of limited temperatures (up to about 150\u00b0C) and \n\nlarge time constants of around 1 s [van der Graaf 1989]. Plated sensors using ceramic \n\nunits are available for operation temperatures above 1000\u00b0C. \n\nA very popular version of plated wire sensors uses a small anodized piece of \n\naluminium inserted into a water-cooled circular housing, commonly known as the \n\nSchmidt-Boelter gauge, illustrated in Figure 1.3 [Kidd and Nelson 1995], available in \n\nsizes as small as 1.5 mm diameter which render them highly attractive for aerodynamic \n\ntesting applications [Neumann 1989]. There is also some ability to contour the surface \n\nof the sensor to match a curved model surface for complex shapes. Care must be taken \n\nwhen measuring low heat fluxes with Schmidt-Boelter gauges, although limitations and \n\nerror avoidance methodologies are well understood [Robertson and Ohlemiller 1995]. \n\nA variation on the differential thermopile heat flux sensor concept relies on the \n\nthermal gradient being artificially created by a temperature differential on the surface \n\nplane of the component. This can be achieved, for example, by using alternate layers of \n\nmaterials of different thermal conductivities or different thicknesses, or by exposing one \n\nhalf of the thermopile junctions to the convective boundary condition fluid [Godefroy et \n\nal. 1990]. Typically using several hundred thermocouple pairs and aluminium \n\nnitride/silicon monoxide vacuum-deposited differential layers, the substantial difference \n\nin the thermal conductivity of the two thermal resistance layers generates a sufficiently \n\nlarge thermal gradient in the plane of the thermopile for sensitive measurements. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Schmidt-Boelter gauge [Hukseflux 2009]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nGardon gauges \n\nThe circular foil gauge was one of the first heat flux gauges originally developed to \n\nmeasure thermal radiation fluxes [Gardon 1953], with its applicability later extended to \n\nconvection measurements [Gardon 1960]. The Gardon gauge (also known as the \n\nasymptotic calorimeter) consists of a hollow cylinder of one material (which acts as a \n\nheat sink) with a thin foil of a second material attached to one end. The radial \n\ntemperature difference between the centre of the disc and its edge is a function of the \n\nheat flux to the disk and of the radial temperature profile, measured by means of a \n\nthermocouple formed by the junction of a thermoelectrically dissimilar wire connected \n\nto the centre of the disc, usually a copper wire connected to a Constantan disc, itself \n\nresting on a copper cylinder as illustrated in Figure 1.4. Each gauge must thus be \n\ncalibrated in order to take into account all the parameters influencing the temperature \n\nprofile, e.g., heat losses through the thermocouple wires and variable thermal properties \n\nof the disk. \n\nFor a uniform heat flux, typical of incoming radiation, the centre to edge \n\ntemperature difference is proportional to the heat flux (neglecting heat losses down the \n\ncentre wire and assuming that thermal conductivity is constant with temperature), that \n\nis: \n\n \n\n \n'' 2\n\n0 4s\nq r\n\nT T\nkL\n\n? = ,  (1.6) \n\n \n\nwhere L is the foil thickness and r the active radius of the foil. The output voltage is \n\nproportional to the product of the temperature and the thermoelectric sensitivity of the \n\ndifferential thermocouple. The gauge\u2019s time response was demonstrated to be [Gardon \n\n1953, Gardon 1960]: \n\n \n\n \n2\n\n4\nr\n\nt\n?\n\n= ,  (1.7) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the material\u2019s thermal diffusivity. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Basic Gardon gauge configuration [Diller, James et al. 1993]. \n\n \n\nParticular care is required when convection heat fluxes are measured. It has \n\nbeen shown both analytically and experimentally that the output is incorrect for \n\nconvective heat transfer because of the distortion of the foil\u2019s temperature profile from \n\nthe assumed radially symmetric, parabolic profile of radiation [Kuo and Kulkarni 1991]. \n\nSince the amount of error is a function of the gauge geometry, the fluid flow and the \n\nheat transfer coefficient, it is difficult to reliably correct. This renders the calibration \n\ncurves, obtained by means of a thermal radiation heat source, inadequate for \n\nconvection heat flux measurements, so that correction factors must be considered \n\n[Diller et al. 1993]. Consequently, great care must be taken to keep the temperature \n\ndifference across the gauge small if Gardon gauges are used to measure convective heat \n\ntransfer. The basic Gardon-type gauges have been widely used over time, namely with \n\nimproved calibration procedures [Ballestr\u00edn et al. 2006], with recent versions making \n\nuse of micromachining technologies [Oh et al. 2006]. \n\nFor high temperature and high heat flux operation, some problems have also \n\nbeen reported [Young et al. 1984, Englund and Seasholtz 1988, Neumann et al. 1988]. \n\nIn situations such as combustors, water cooling is usually supplied through the body of \n\nthe sensor to keep the temperature from exceeding material limits. Due to the resulting \n\ntemperature mismatch between the gauge and surrounding material in which it is \n\nmounted, a water-cooled gauge is not recommended for convection heat transfer \n\nmeasurements. It is also important for a water-cooled gauge to ensure that \n\ncondensation does not occur on the sensor face. Despite the aforementioned limitations, \n\nsuccessful high-temperature measurements have been reported using circular foil gauges \n\n[Thibault and Hoffman 1979, Shepherd 1985].  \n\nAlthough most heat flux sensors are designed to measure the total heat flux, \n\nsensors have been developed to separate convection from radiation (as discussed in \n\nfurther detail below). The most common method is to put a transparent window over \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nthe sensor to eliminate convection to the sensor face. Once the resulting sensor only \n\nmeasures radiation, it is termed a radiometer. The field of view can however be limited \n\nin these radiometers and must be included in the interpretation of results. In a dirty \n\nenvironment where the transmission of the window could be degraded, air is usually \n\nblown across the face of the window to keep particles away from the sensor. \n\nGardon gauges have been reported in use for fire spread experiments in the \n\nfield, measuring both total and radiant heat fluxes emitted from the flame front, a \n\nsapphire window attachment being added to the radiant heat flux transducer to \n\neliminate convective heat transfer [Silvani and Morandini 2009], with the usual caveats \n\nregarding mixed convective-radiative experiments, which have been widely studied \n\n[Kuo and Kulkarni 1991], still applying. As with Schmidt-Boelter gauges, care must be \n\ntaken when measuring low heat fluxes [Robertson and Ohlemiller 1995]. Both types of \n\ngauges are also used as components in hybrid heat flux measurement systems such as \n\nthe so-called plate thermometer [Ingason and Wickstr\u00f6m 2007]. \n\nRefractive index methods \n\nA temperature gradient across a transparent medium will cause a local variation in its \n\nrefractive index. This physical phenomenon can be measured by a number of optical \n\ntechniques such as schlieren photography, shadowgraph and interferometry. The \n\nsensitivity of each method is different, with the schlieren and shadowgraph techniques \n\nbeing appropriate for large thermal gradient applications and interferometry for \n\napplications where the thermal gradient is less severe as in, for example, natural \n\nconvection [Goldstein 1970]. \n\n1.3.2 Temporal Temperature Change Techniques \n\nThe basic heat transfer equations can describe the relationship between temperature \n\ngradients and surface heat transfer. If the wall material thermal properties are known \n\nalong with sufficient detail about the temperature history and distribution, heat \n\ntransfer can be determined as a function of time, after some manipulation, at a location \n\nnear to or on the surface of interest. Two general types of solutions are used to reduce \n\nthe temperature history to heat flux. These are commonly designated as the semi-\n\ninfinite solution and calorimeter methods. Usually involved are surface temperature \n\nmeasurements using thermocouples or RTDs and optical methods that allow for \n\nsimultaneous measurement of temperatures over the entire surface. All require \n\nsubstantial effort from the user to initiate the test procedure and reduce the data to \n\nfind heat flux.  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nA number of techniques are based on these principles, including slug \n\ncalorimeters, plug gauges, null point calorimeters, coaxial thermocouple gauges, thin-\n\nskin and thin-film sensors, and surface temperature monitoring of the whole \n\ncomponent. \n\nAn important technique for short-duration heat flux tests is to measure the \n\nsurface temperature history on a test object with a fast-response temperature sensor. \n\nFor sufficiently short times and a sufficiently thick material, heat transfer can be \n\nassumed to be one-dimensional and thermal effects considered not to reach the back \n\nsurface of the material. The temporal temperature variation \n\n \n\n \n2 2 2\n\n2 2 2\np\n\nT k T T T\n\nt c x y z?\n\n? ?? ? ? ? ?? ?= + +? ?? ???? ? ? ?? ?\n,  (1.8) \n\n \n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ? is the density and cp is the specific heat, becomes \n\na one-dimensional, semi-infinite solution, and for a step change of heat flux at time      \n\nt = 0 the surface temperature is given by [Diller et al. 1993]: \n\n \n\n \n''\n\nS i\n\np\n\n2q t\nT T\n\nk c? ?\n? = ,  (1.9) \n\n \n\nwhere Ti is the uniform initial temperature of the substrate and Ts is the surface \n\ntemperature as a function of time. Data analysis of the measured temperature record \n\ncan be performed by several methods, the simplest of which makes use of the analytical \n\nsolution with each sampled data point to recreate the heat flux signal. The most \n\npopular equation for this conversion for uniformly sampled data (i.e. uniform time \n\nsteps) for any time tn is [Cook and Felderman 1966]: \n\n \n\n \np'' 1\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n( )\n\nn\ni i\n\nn\n\ni\ni i\n\nk c T T\nq t\n\nt t t t\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n=\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n? + ?\n? .  (1.10) \n\n \n\nModifications are also available to provide higher solution stability [Diller and \n\nKidd 1997], as well as numerical solutions to account for changes in property values \n\nwith varying temperatures [George et al. 1991]. Due to the noise amplification inherent \n\nin the conversion from temperature to heat flux, analogue methods have been \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\ndeveloped to electronically convert the temperature signal before digitizing the signal \n\n[Schultz and Jones 1973]. \n\nSlug calorimeters, plug gauges and null point calorimeters \n\nA typical slug calorimeter comprises a quantity or \u2018slug\u2019 of material, thermally \n\ninsulated from its surroundings, as illustrated in Figure 1.5. A single temperature \n\nmeasurement at the base of the slug is made and is assumed to represent the \n\ntemperature of the entire slug mass m, this assumption being valid within a few per \n\ncent if the Biot number, Bi = hL/k, is lower than 0.1, with k and h being the \n\nconduction and convection heat transfer coefficients, respectively, and L the depth of \n\nthe slug. This condition is essentially a classic lumped mass approximation in which the \n\ntemperature throughout the sensor is assumed to be uniform while changing with time. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 \u2013 Slug calorimeter [Diller et al. 1993]. \n\n \n\nWhen exposed to a fluid at a temperature Tf and heat transfer coefficient h over \n\nan active area A, the solution for the temperature change is the following exponential \n\nfunction [ASTM 1988a]: \n\n \n\n f t\n\ni f\n\nT T\ne\n\nT T\n??\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n,  (1.11) \n\n \n\nwhere Ti is the initial temperature and the time constant ? is: \n\n \n\n p\nmc\n\nhA\n? = .  (1.12) \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nThe time constant can be derived from the temperature response of the system, \n\nwhich can then be used to quantify the heat transfer coefficient h. Although these \n\ncalorimeters are simple in principle, it is often difficult to obtain reliable results because \n\nof heat losses and non-uniform temperatures. If more accurate results are required, the \n\nlosses through the insulation layer should be modelled and accounted for by a \n\ncorrection term [Diller et al. 1993]: \n\n \n\n p p\nd d\n\nd dloss loss\nmc mcT T\n\nq q K T\nA t A t\n\n= + = + ? ,  (1.13) \n\n \n\nwhere ?T is the temperature difference between the slug calorimeter and the \n\nsurrounding material. This can be taken as the rise in temperature of the slug, \n\nassuming that the surrounding material temperature remains constant for the duration \n\nof the data acquisition. The constant Kloss for a given sensor can be determined by \n\ncalibration and supplied by a laboratory or manufacturer. Slug calorimeters are \n\nnormally used when the energy input to the surface is fairly constant. They can only \n\nproduce useful data for short exposures; the duration of use is limited because T will \n\napproach T? and they must be restored to an initial condition before reuse. It is \n\nrecommended that a period defined by t = L2/2? be allowed prior to logging of data \n\n[ASTM 1988a]. Severe disadvantages of this form of device, particularly when \n\nmeasuring large heat fluxes, are the disruption to the thermal boundary layer owing to \n\nthe thermal discontinuities introduced by the sensor material boundaries and the \n\ndifficulty of quantifying the heat losses through the insulation layer. It is recommended \n\nthat the slug itself is manufactured with the same material as the surroundings in order \n\nto ensure minimization of non-uniform temperature effects. Despite the aforementioned \n\nlimitations in terms of experiment time limitations the development of slug calorimeter-\n\nbased system continues, including as part of calibration facilities and flammability and \n\nfire safety studies [Filipczak and Lyon 2002, Filipczak et al. 2005]. \n\nThe plug gauge is a development of the slug calorimeter [Liebert 1994], \n\ncomprising a slug instrumented with multiple thermocouples to provide the \n\ntemperature distribution. An annulus is created on the backside of the surface, four \n\nthermocouples being attached along the remaining plug to estimate both the \n\ntemperature gradient and the change in thermal energy content in the plug. This setup \n\ngives a better estimate of the heat flux than the slug calorimeter. An additional \n\nadvantage is that the measurement surface is physically undisturbed. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nNull-point calorimeters are a further extension of the slug calorimeter principle, \n\ndeveloped to improve plug gauge response times [ASTM 1988b]. They are designed for \n\nthe measurement of extremely high heat flux levels (over 1000 kWm-2). In order to \n\nprotect the thermocouple and wires, these are mounted in a cavity behind the surface, \n\nthe temperature measurement location being placed closer to the surface. The heat flux \n\nmeasurement is based on a one-dimensional transient conduction solution and is given, \n\nas for a semi-infinite geometry, by Equation 1.10. In order to eliminate the effects of \n\nthe initial temperature transient on the indicated heat flux, a value of 1.375 is \n\nrecommended for the ratio of hole diameter to the thermocouple distance from the \n\nsurface, b [Kidd 1990b]. Measurements can be taken until the thermal transient reaches \n\nthe back of the sensor at depth L, the useful period of measurement being bounded by: \n\n \n\n \n2 23 0.3b L\n\nt\n? ?\n\n&lt;&lt;.  (1.14) \n\n \n\nThe term on the right-hand side of the above inequality is associated with an \n\nerror in the semi-infinite approximation of less than 1% [Kidd 1990b]. \n\nCoaxial thermocouple gauges \n\nThe principle of the coaxial gauge is to measure the variation in surface temperature \n\ndirectly as a function of time. A thermocouple is formed by a concentric arrangement \n\nconsisting of a central thermocouple material which is electrically isolated from the \n\nouter thermocouple material by an insulating sheath. The thermocouple circuit is \n\ncompleted at the surface by applying a thin layer of one of the thermocouple materials \n\nby, for example, vacuum deposition. Alternatively, the thermocouple circuit can be \n\ncompleted by removing the insulation at the tip and soldering or merging the two \n\nmetals together. The heat flux can be determined from the temporal temperature \n\nmeasurement as for null-point calorimeters. Average coaxial thermocouple material \n\nproperties can be used for the material properties product, ?cpk [Garcia and de Schor \n\n1990, Kidd 1990a]. Response times are typically 1 ms or less which, although slower \n\nthan the thin-film sensors, are sufficient for a wide range of applications [Neumann \n\n1989]. \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nThin-skin and thin-film devices \n\nThis method has been used to study heat transfer in, for example, spacecraft or nuclear \n\nwarhead re-entry vehicles. In these studies, part of the surface of a model or component \n\nis removed and replaced with a thin layer or \u2018skin\u2019 of a highly conductive material such \n\nas copper, which forms the slug calorimeter [Schultz and Jones 1973]. \n\nThe assumption in the analysis is that the rate of temperature rise at the rear \n\nsurface, which can be monitored with thermocouples, is equal to the rate of rise in the \n\nmean temperature. Lateral conduction along the skin is ignored. Heat loss from the rear \n\nof the skin is assumed to be negligible due to the presence of insulation. Air, which has \n\na relatively low thermal conductivity, can be used for this purpose. Because of advances \n\nin thin-film and optical surface temperature measurement, the thin-skin method is \n\nconsidered outdated for most modern aerodynamic testing [Neumann 1989], but is in \n\nmuch use for thermal conductivity measurements [Louren\u00e7o et al. 2000]. \n\nThin-film sensors are physically small devices applied to the surface of interest \n\nand exhibit fast response to thermal conditions because of their small size, as illustrated \n\nin Figure 1.6. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 - Basic thin film sensor configuration [Diller et al. 1993]. \n\n \n\nA metallic resistance layer is sputtered, painted and baked, or plated onto the \n\nsurface. Because the resulting thickness of the sensor is less than 0.1 \u00b5m the response \n\ntime is a fraction of 1 \u00b5s and there should be no physical or thermal disruption of the \n\nmeasured temperature due to the sensor. The method is used for basic measurements \n\napplicable to gas turbine engines, rockets, internal combustion engines and high-speed \n\naerodynamics [Diller et al. 1993]. In addition to surface temperature measurement \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n(single-layer sensors), thin-film sensors can also be used to measure heat flux in layered \n\nor composite assemblies. \n\nSensors of this type were traditionally obtained by vacuum depositing or \n\npainting, and sintering on to platinum resistance thermometers an electrically \n\ninsulating surface, with lead wires obtained in similar fashion. It is not always \n\npracticable to manufacture components of an insulating material that will allow the \n\napplication of thin-film surface sensors for heat transfer studies. One technique to \n\novercome this limitation involves the application of sensors to a polyamide film. An \n\nalternative development for use in aggressive environments, such as turbomachinery \n\nresearch, involves the application of vitreous enamel to a component for electrical \n\nisolation of the surface sensors [Doorly 1988]. \n\nMost thin films produced by a wide variety of methods, either physical or \n\nchemical (PVD, CVD, sputtering, etc.) for temperature sensor applications, can be used \n\nonly in very narrow ranges of temperatures, where their components are not subjected \n\nto differential thermal expansions, recrystallizations, and grain size modifications \n\n[Louren\u00e7o et al. 1998]. \n\nThin-film sensors have also been combined in a hybrid instrument for solar \n\nradiation measurements which relies on them for direct heat flux measurements, which \n\nare compared and satisfactorily corroborated by an indirect system, consisting of a \n\nCCD camera that uses a water-cooled heat flux sensor as a reference for converting \n\ngray-scale levels into heat flux values [Ballestr\u00edn and Monterreal 2004]. \n\nOptical surface monitoring \n\nOptical methods allow the measurement of the entire temperature field over a section \n\nof the surface, with a large amount of data being collected but requiring a more \n\nchallenging interpretation of data to obtain quantitative heat flux values than with \n\nmeasurements systems that use point sensors.  \n\nThe most widespread optical temperature measurement method is the use of \n\nliquid crystals to record colour change. Of particular relevance to heat transfer studies \n\nare the cholesteric (or chiral-nematic) liquid crystals which react to changes in \n\ntemperature and shear stress by changing colour. These are popularly named \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nthermochromic liquid crystals. The thermal response of crystals, which is dependent on \n\ntheir viscosity, ranges from 5 ms to a few seconds [Ireland and Jones 1987]. They \n\ndegrade when exposed to ultraviolet light and are prone to chemical contamination. As \n\na consequence, crystals are encapsulated in polymer spheres, forming a water-based \n\nslurry that can be painted or applied with an airbrush to the surface of interest for use \n\nover temperature ranges from 5 to 150\u00b0C. Setting the lighting for reproducible colour, \n\ntemperature calibration, image acquisition, and accurately establishing the starting \n\ntemperature are crucial steps, detailed procedures for accurate measurements having \n\nbeen established [Baughn 1995, Camci 1996, Alekseev 1997]. A complete system \n\ntypically includes a high-quality video camera, lighting system, calibration system, \n\ncomputer hardware and software for image processing and a liquid crystal kit. \n\nAlthough the basic materials are cheap, the associated equipment is expensive. \n\nThe colours can be recorded by means of a video camera and can be stored in \n\nterms of the primary colours: red, green and blue. The frames can later be digitally \n\nanalysed via a computer and frame grabber and the data converted from the RGB \n\nsystem to a hue, saturation and intensity system. Comparison of the hue values with \n\ncalibration results gives the surface temperature for each pixel location. A video \n\nrecording of the surface temperature variation in response to a fluid temperature \n\nchange can be used to determine the surface heat flux and corresponding surface heat \n\ntransfer coefficient. For semi-infinite conditions, the optically measured variation in \n\ntemperature with time can be related to the heat transfer coefficient (assumed \n\nconstant) by solving the following equation: \n\n \n\n \n2\n\ni\n\ni\n\n1 erfc( )\nT T\n\ne\nT T\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n= ?\n\n?\n,  (1.15) \n\n \n\nwhere \n\n \n\n \np\n\nt\nh\n\nc k\n?\n\n?\n=   (1.16) \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nand erfc(.) is the complementary error function available in standard mathematics \n\ntexts. \n\nThermographic phosphors emit radiation in the visible spectrum when \n\nilluminated with ultraviolet light. The intensity of emission at specific wavelengths can \n\nbe related to the temperature over a wide range of surface temperatures. A CCD \n\ncamera is required to record the transient optical images and calibration is challenging, \n\nbut high-temperature applications are particularly appealing [Bizzak and Chyu 1995]. \n\nInfrared thermography is also in widespread use, with a variety of recent references \n\navailable [Hakenesch 1999, Astarita et al. 2000, Astarita et al. 2006]. \n\nThermal Radiation Methods \n\nAll materials continuously absorb and emit electromagnetic waves or photons by \n\nraising or lowering their molecular energy levels. The intensity and wavelengths \n\ndistribution of emission can be related to the absolute temperature of the material. \n\nAccording to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, radiated heat transfer is proportional to the \n\nfourth power of the difference in temperature. Detectors of thermal radiation or \n\nradiometers can broadly be grouped according to how the incoming radiation interacts \n\nwith the detector material. Generally, thermal detectors convert incident radiation into \n\na temperature rise and photon detectors absorb the energy of the incident radiation. \n\nPhoton detectors were initially more laboratory-bound due to the fact that they were \n\nusually more fragile than thermal detectors but they are nevertheless in continuous \n\ndevelopment because they are inherently adequate to high temperature applications \n\n[Bhattacharya et al. 2007]. Not all photomultiplication-based instruments are fragile, \n\nhowever, since heavy-duty, rugged versions exist for radiation measurements in \n\nindustrial burners [Sanz et al. 2008]. \n\nThe advantage of thermal radiation methods is that they are non-contact or \n\nnon-disruptive. Sensing surfaces are often treated with appropriate coatings in order to \n\nestablish known, high surface absorptivities/emissivities, enabling thermal radiation \n\nmeasurements. However, some problems arise if these measurements are to be carried \n\nout in high temperature, aggressive environments such as those usually found in heavy-\n\nduty industrial equipment.  Basic problems to be solved are the need to avoid sensing \n\nelement surface fouling, corrosion problems and contamination of the measurements by \n\nthe convective component of the total heat flux, not to mention the simple survival of \n\nthe instrument in such a hostile environment. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nIn situations where convection and radiation coexist, gauges generally measure \n\nthe total heat flux. In order to perform heat flux partitioning, gauges are usually \n\ndesigned to measure either radiation or convection, but not both. Arguably the easiest \n\nway to measure only radiation is to place a transparent window or lens between the \n\nradiation source and the heat flux gauge. A number of devices are based on this \n\napproach [McGee 1988], such as pyrometers, bolometers and infrared cameras, \n\nrepresenting a well-developed and specialized field. The purpose of this review is not, \n\nhowever, to detail these devices. Incident heat fluxes are typically measured either with \n\ngauges using RTDs or thermocouples, or by directly measuring the radiation with \n\nphotoconductive detectors [Baker and Ryder 1975]. In a different approach, the total \n\nheat flux and the convection component can be measured by using two heat flux \n\ngauges, one with a high-emissivity coating and the other with a low-emissivity coating, \n\nthe radiation component being the difference between the measurements of the two \n\ngauges. Illustrated in Figure 1.7 is an example of such a sensor [Hukseflux 2009], with \n\none gauge coated with gold and the other with a black absorbent. \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\nFigure 1.7 \u2013 Convective and radiative heat flux sensor with two sensing elements of different \n\nemissivities [Hukseflux 2009]. \n\n \n\nOther variations on the layered gauge principle for high temperature \n\nmeasurements rely on water-cooled configurations, many of which were developed from \n\nthe latter half of the 1960s to the early 1970s [Anson and Godridge 1967, Schulte and \n\nKohl 1970]. Illustrated in Figure 1.8 is the Anson-Godridge sensor, used to measure the \n\nheat flux within an oil-burning boiler. Other similar systems were reported for use as a \n\ntotal heat flux meter in power plant boilers, with an interesting contribution regarding \n\nthe proposed engineering solutions to permanently install the gauges inside the boiler. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nSince the meters are directly installed on the heat exchanger tubes, the heat sink and \n\ngauge cooling system are the tubes themselves. A portable version was also proposed, \n\nwhere a heat pipe took the role of the boiler tubes [Neal et al. 1980]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8 \u2013 Anson-Godridge sensor [Anson and Godridge 1967]. \n\n \n\nProblems arise with the radiation-only devices when the environment of the \n\nmeasurement is dirty enough to leave deposits on the window, which degrades its \n\ntransmission. The hollow ellipsoidal total radiation flux meter uses a thermopile as the \n\nsensing element where all the radiation entering through an inlet small orifice is focused \n\nby an ellipsoidal mirror [Chedaille and Braud 1972], the basic sensing element being the \n\nlayered gauge described above. The ellipsoidal mirror, with a near-unitary reflectivity \n\nregardless of wavelength and incident angle, is added in order to focus all the radiation \n\nfalling on the frontal orifice of the heat flux sensor. A flow of dry nitrogen is injected \n\nthrough small holes placed at the mirror walls in order to avoid the condensation of \n\nvapours and the deposition of particles. The sensitivity and response time of this gauge \n\ndepend essentially on the thermopile used as sensing element. The most important \n\nadvantage of the ellipsoidal radiometer is its high efficiency in converting thermal \n\nradiation into sensible heat (once again regardless of wavelength and direction of \n\nincidence), its major drawbacks being the influence of the nitrogen stream on readings, \n\nits fragility and the need for periodic calibration which limits its use to laboratory \n\napplications. The cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the ellipsoidal mirror and the location \n\nof the thermopile give the gauge its high sensitivity and are main factors contributing \n\nto its fragility. Any degradation in mirror reflectivity strongly affects the gauge \n\nperformance and the validity of its calibration curve. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nThe basic ellipsoidal radiometer has been continuously developed over time, \n\ninvolving improved versions of the instrument itself, its applications in full-scale \n\nindustrial studies [Hayes et al. 2001] and its calibration procedures [Murthy et al. 2000, \n\nHayes et al. 2001, Murthy et al. 2003], with further refinements still taking place and \n\nyielding higher sensitivities [Oliveira and Yanagihara 2004, Oliveira and Yanagihara \n\n2008]. This improved version, designated as a semi-ellipsoidal radiometer due to its \n\nmodified cavity geometry, is illustrated in Figure 1.9. \n\n \n\n \n    \n\nFigure 1.9 \u2013 Semi-ellipsoidal radiometer [Oliveira and Yanagihara 2008]. \n\n \n\nOther radiometers adequate for application in thermal radiation measurements \n\nin full-scale furnaces were proposed. One of them is also a variation of the layered \n\ngauge, but in this case the gas screen around the sensing element is present mainly in \n\norder to eliminate the convective component of the total heat flux [Ballintijn and \n\nGinsel 1968]. Considering the sensing element type and the described design, relatively \n\ngood sensitivities can be obtained at the expense of large response times. However, this \n\ngauge can distinguish between radiative and total heat flux just by switching the gas \n\nscreen on or off, thereby performing heat flux partitioning. It also comprises a rugged \n\nand simple design, which is an important consideration when industrial uses are \n\nforeseen. Its principal problems are the limited ability of the gas screen to avoid fouling \n\nand the convective heat flux component, with adverse effects on the gauge accuracy \n\nand reliability, and the possible cooling effect of the sensing element due to the gas \n\nscreen. Despite these limitations, the gauge was successfully used for heat flux studies \n\nin industrial furnaces [Hoogendoorn et al. 1970]. \n\nAnother solution developed for measuring radiation heat flux in combusting \n\nenvironments is the transpiration radiometer, this technique having been successfully \n\napplied to the measurement of radiative heat loads in gas turbine engines [Atkinson et \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nal. 1988] and to the characterization of pool fires [Matthews and Longenbaugh 1989]. \n\nThe basic principle is to blow air through a porous plug (essentially a thin porous disk \n\nmounted on a cylindrical water-cooled copper body) which composes the exposed \n\nsurface of the gauge, rather than around the sensing element. The air flow has several \n\npurposes, the first of which is to literally blow-off any fluid boundary layer from the \n\nsurface of the gauge if the flow is sufficiently high, resulting in the elimination of \n\nconvection. Secondly, the flow provides the temperature difference measured by the \n\ngauge, the output signal being proportional to the difference between the porous disk \n\nand inlet air temperatures. The output signal is monitored by a differential \n\nthermocouple, one of the junctions being attached to the back face of the porous disk \n\n(on its axis line) and the junction set in the transpiration gas stream just behind the \n\ndisk. The thermal radiation flux is proportional to the signal obtained with the \n\ndifferential thermocouple, i.e., to the temperature difference between the porous \n\nmedium and the transpiration stream. The porous disk temperature is itself a function \n\nof the flow rate and specific heat of the air, as well as of the net radiation heat flux to \n\nthe disk. The balance between gas cooling and radiation heating determines the disk \n\ntemperature, although a calibration procedure is necessary to establish the efficiency of \n\nthe heat transfer process between the gas and the disk. A second thermocouple can be \n\nattached to the disk edge, allowing the use of the instrument as a Gardon gauge if the \n\ngas stream is switched off [Moffat et al. 1971]. \n\nThe instrument requires two calibration steps. The first is the determination of \n\nthe transpiration gas mass flow rate required to eliminate the convective heat flux. The \n\nsecond step is required in order to obtain a correlation between the incident radiation \n\nflux and the corresponding output signal, the whole calibration procedure being \n\nperformed under the same conditions (pressure and external cooling) found during \n\nactual measurements. This complex calibration procedure is the gauge\u2019s main \n\ndisadvantage, which is offset by significant advantages such as the possibility of \n\nmeasuring radiation heat fluxes even in the presence of convection or other thermal \n\nfluxes governed by external flow aerodynamics. In addition, the gauge is naturally not \n\naffected by fouling, since particles are deflected by the transpiration stream and the \n\nsensing element has a view angle of virtually 180\u00b0.  \n\nA similar but slightly different radiometer for operation in high-ash boilers was \n\nproposed and studied in detail [Moffat et al. 1971, Brajuskovic and Afgan 1991, \n\nBrajuskovic et al. 1991]. Basic differences are the fact that instead of going through the \n\nplug, the air is directed through slots around a solid plug, and the sensing element is \n\nreplaced by a Gardon-type heat flux sensor. Indeed, the air flow keeps the ash particles \n\nfrom reaching the heat flux gauge and it takes away the thermal energy as in other \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\ntranspiration gauges, and heat transfer is radial trough the plug as in a circular foil \n\ngauge. The heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference measured between \n\nthe centre and the edge of the plug. This \u201cclean\u201d heat flux gauge can be used with a \n\nsecond gauge that has no air flow, to form a system to measure particle deposition in \n\ncombustors. As deposition occurs in the \u201cdirty\u201d gauge surface, the heat transfer \n\nresistance increases and the measured heat flux drops [Marner et al. 1989]. The \n\nthickness of the deposit can then be related to the difference in heat transfer between \n\nthe two gauges. Another fundamental difference is a significantly more powerful \n\nscreening jet (with a maximum velocity at least twice as high), when compared with \n\nthe previous solutions. The effect of the screening-gas flow rate level on the calibration \n\ncurve and response time was investigated, and time constants between 2.3 and 4.6 \n\nseconds and an accuracy of plus or minus 10% or better were reported in detailed \n\nstudies of this gauge [Brajuskovic and Afgan 1991]. Due to their ability to perform heat \n\nflux partitioning and to evaluate deposit thicknesses, these radiometers are the basis of \n\nonline furnace and boiler diagnostic systems [Calisto et al. 2008]. \n\nThe same principle of blowing off the convective component of the total heat \n\nflux is used in another heat flux meter (which reverts to the option of having gas \n\ncrossing the sensitive element) that allows the separate measurement of the convection \n\nand radiation components of the total heat flux. Once again, if the transpiration gas \n\nflow rate is above a critical flow rate, sufficient for blowing off the boundary layer on \n\nthe sensing element surface, the sensing element is exposed to the total heat flux, i.e., \n\nconvection plus radiation heat fluxes. If the transpiration gas mass flow rate is higher \n\nthat the critical flow rate, the convection heat flux to the sensing element is eliminated \n\nand the sensing element only receives the radiation heat flux. With two independent \n\nsuccessive measurements, there is the possibility of assessing both the radiation and the \n\nconvection components of the received heat flux, effectively performing radiation \n\npartitioning [Afgan and Leontiev 1995]. This instrument uses a thick (namely when \n\ncompared with Gardon foils) porous disk as sensing element, replacing the thin net \n\nused in earlier instruments [Moffat et al. 1971].  \n\nThe thicker porous disc has the advantage of collecting the totality of the \n\nthermal radiation incident on the surface, no thermal radiation escaping to the inner \n\nside of the gauge body due to the non-existent transmissivity of the porous element. In \n\naddition, temperature measurements are made at the front and back surfaces of the \n\nporous disk, enabling the determination of the incoming radiation by an energy balance \n\nto the porous disk. This configuration was pursued further, first by obtaining and \n\ntesting an operational version of the instrument [Martins et al. 1998, Martins et al. \n\n2000], then by extending its application range in order to effectively perform heat flux \n\n\n\n \n\npartitioning and to obtain a faster response version using a transient operational mode\n\n[Martins et al. 2006a, Martins \n\nas discussed in the following chapters.

This methodology is akin to other applied in other \n\nestablished techniques such as hot wire anemometry or thermal conductivity \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nThe usual energy exchange method is by means of an electric circuit heater or \n\nby dissipation of a pulsed radiation source from a laser, namely because the power is \n\neasily measured and controlled. Cooling can be achieved with convective passageways \n\nwithin the device or by means of the Peltier effect [Shewan et al. 1989]. Owing to the \n\nresponse time of a typical active heat flux sensor arrangement and of power limitations \n\nassociated to the electrical heating, these methods are not recommended for either high \n\nheat fluxes or for high temperature applications, limiting its applicability in high-\n\ntemperature industrial furnaces. Active heating methods have also been incorporated \n\non low boundary condition-disruption devices [Saidi and Kim 2004]. \n\nA typical sensor design for the measurement of heat transfer into a surface is \n\nthe use of heater strips exposed to the convective boundary condition but well insulated \n\non the back and sides of the sensor. Electric current is passed through the heater strip \n\nmaterial until equilibrium is achieved, monitored by a surface temperature device such \n\nas a thermocouple or RTD. A wide variety of such devices has been developed and \n\nanalysed [Poloniecki et al. 1995]. A sandwich construction can be applied to a surface, \n\ncomprising an insulating layer, a heater, a black background and a liquid crystal layer, \n\nin order to obtain local steady state heat transfer values. Commonly used heaters have \n\nincluded thermistors, thin layers of gold, nichrome wires and carbon fibres. The \n\ndifficulty in applying a uniform layer to a complex geometry can be overcome by means \n\nof producing a flexible sandwich which can be stuck to the component of interest. One \n\nembodiment of this technique is to use carbon fibres as the heater within an epoxy \n\nresin. Thermochromic liquid crystals are applied to the surface to measure the \n\ntemperature.  \n\nEnergy supply methods can also be used in a transient mode by applying a \n\nknown quantity of heat to a surface and by measuring the thermal response. The use of \n\na laser to supply a discrete local heat flux, along with an infrared camera system, has \n\nalso been employed to determine the local surface temperature distribution due to \n\nheating [Porro et al. 1991]. A conduction solution using this measured temperature \n\ndistribution can be used to calculate the heat transfer coefficient. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nMass transfer analogy techniques \n\nWell-known mathematical similarities between the partial differential equations that \n\ngovern heat and mass transfer are embodied in the boundary layer relations that rely \n\non the Nusselt, Reynolds, Prandtl, Sherwood and Schmidt adimensional numbers. \n\nThese can be practically exploited in order to obtain heat transfer measurements from \n\nthe observations of mass transfer experiments, which have the advantage of being \n\ngenerally much easier to carry out (especially on complex or difficult geometries) than \n\nheat transfer experiments and are less prone to experimental error and uncertainty. \n\nAdditionally, it is much easier to model the equivalent of adiabatic and isothermal \n\nboundary conditions.  \n\nOne of the best-known mass transfer methods is the naphthalene sublimation \n\ntechnique [Goldstein and Cho 1995]. At atmospheric pressure and temperatures, \n\nnaphthalene (C10H8) sublimates from solid to vapour, i.e. without any intermediate \n\nliquid phase. This, together with the fact that naphthalene is easily cast and machined, \n\nand that its relevant thermophysical properties are well documented, make it an ideal \n\nchoice. Naphthalene is applied to the surface using casting, machining, spraying or \n\ndipping (or a combination of these), the local mass distribution being measured by \n\neither weighing or using a surface profile gauge. In order to obtain local rather than \n\nsurface-average information, the surface is divided into a number of individual \n\nsegments which are weighed separately. The experiment is run for a long enough period \n\nin order to create a reasonable loss of the solid naphthalene, the transferred mass being \n\nmeasured by either weighing or using a surface profile gauge at the completion of the \n\nexperimental run. Using the appropriate heat and mass transfer relations, the Nusselt \n\nnumber, and hence the convective heat transfer coefficient, can be computed. Albeit \n\nuseful, the technique does have a number of drawbacks, namely excessive experimental \n\ntimes at low flow velocities and the difficulty of adequately controlling ambient \n\ntemperature over long periods. The vapour pressure of naphthalene is very sensitive to \n\nambient temperature, so that long experimental times can produce significant \n\nexperimental errors.  \n\n Vapour pressure sensitivity to temperature is also important at high velocities \n\nwhere viscous heating occurs. In high shear flows, naphthalene can be worn-off the \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nsurface by erosion. Long experimental times may cause significant changes in shape in \n\nthe mass transfer model. The results are by definition time-average values. For wind \n\ntunnels, a naphthalene-free air stream should be maintained and variations in air \n\nsupply temperature minimized. The latent heat of vaporization of naphthalene will \n\ncause a drop in the actual surface temperature compared with that of the free stream. \n\nIt is therefore advisable to measure the temperature of the naphthalene model by \n\nthermocouples on the surface. This technique has nonetheless been used to provide \n\naccurate and valuable data for applications where conventional heat transfer \n\ninstrumentation would be more difficult, in particular: external and internal flows, \n\nnatural convection, fins and heat exchanger geometries, turbulence promoters, \n\nimpinging jets, rotating surfaces and the cooling of electronic devices [Souza Mendes \n\n1991]. \n\n1.3.4 Conclusions \n\nAn analysis of the main features, advantages and disadvantages of the various methods \n\nmakes relevant some comparisons with those of the instrument developed and described \n\nherein. \n\nInstruments with short response times are typically laboratory-bound and \n\ncomparatively fragile devices, since their fast responses are often achieved with low \n\nthermal inertia components at the expense of robustness. At the opposite side of the \n\nspectrum, so to speak, are rugged industrial-grade instruments meant for operation in \n\nhigh-temperature, aggressive environments were fouling may be an issue. These tend to \n\nhave much larger response times and are usually bulky and require subsystems such as \n\nwater cooling circuits or must incorporate features such as windows for convection \n\ncontamination avoidance in the case of radiometers which, in any case, tend to increase \n\noverall dimensions, complexity and unit cost. Air-blowing cleaning systems can also be \n\nused both for fouling avoidance and for boundary layer blow-off, thus avoiding \n\nconvection contamination. Furthermore, the implementation of heat flux partitioning \n\nrequires instruments that are usually more complex, typically having two separate \n\nsensing elements, or even two separate instruments for measuring each component of \n\nthe incident heat flux. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nThe proposed instrument, while somewhat less robust than earlier transpiration \n\nradiometers, was proven to withstand environments with high temperatures and the \n\npresence of soot and dust particles. Thanks to its low thermal inertia microperforated \n\nsensing element, the designed and proposed instrument allows faster responses than \n\nconventional radiometers without significantly compromising its robustness and \n\nespecially without losing the ability to avoid fouling thanks to its transpiration airflow. \n\nFurthermore, faster temperature responses allow a transient operational mode that \n\npotentially enables heat flux partitioning implementation, which is aided by the precise \n\nairflow control allowed by the instruments precisely defined and comparatively simple \n\ngeometry. Comparatively diminished dimensions and complexity are achieved using air \n\nrather than water refrigeration. This instrument was the subject of a patent \n\napplication, and the fact that this patent was granted indicates that the issuing \n\norganization\u2019s own services did not find any instruments with quite the same features \n\nas the one under discussion, which validates the intended novelty and contribution of \n\nthe present document. \n\n1.4 Objectives and Thesis Contribution \n\nThe literature review carried out beforehand shows that most of the established \n\nmethods were developed to be used in clean, well-controlled laboratory environments. \n\nIn many cases, the proposed techniques are too complex and expensive to be \n\ntransferred to current industrial applications and have significant limitations when used \n\nin high temperature, aggressive environments, leading to a lack of heat flux gauges able \n\nto be used in high temperature, aggressive industrial equipment. \n\nFrom the discussion in the paragraphs above, a clear development line towards \n\na rugged and reliable radiometer becomes apparent, from the basic principle of using a \n\ntranspiration gas both to eliminate convection by blowing off the boundary layer and \n\nto deflect incoming soot particles in order to diminish fouling. A robust operational \n\nversion had been obtained in earlier work, with adequate performance but much \n\npotential for further enhancements, especially as far as bulk and response times were \n\nconcerned. Its potential for heat flux partitioning was indentified and discussed but not \n\nachieved, while other instruments that enable that partition are not suitable for \n\naggressive environments. The next logical step to be taken was thus to attempt: \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n\u2022 A diminution of the sensor\u2019s overall dimensions; \n\n\u2022 A reduction of the sensor\u2019s response time; \n\n\u2022 The implementation of heat flux partitioning. \n\nThese objectives and contributions of the work described here had however to \n\nbe achieved without compromising earlier instrument\u2019s demonstrated capabilities and \n\nadvantages.  \n\nThe problems of the large time constant and of the implementation of a \n\ntransient operation that would enable an effective heat flux partitioning are related \n\nbecause of the control of allowable thermal levels in the system and of the impact of \n\nthe transpiration airflow in the temperature fields within the sensing element. The \n\nlatter\u2019s features, notably its morphology and thermal inertia, were also variables to be \n\nconsidered. \n\nPrevious instruments were unable to implement heat flux partitioning because \n\nof the need to keep temperatures below certain values, especially in order to keep its \n\nradiative emission low when compared to incident radiation from the surroundings. \n\nThis meant that the transpiration airflow could not be switched off for enough time to \n\nimplement a transient operation mode where the instrument\u2019s steady response was \n\nanticipated by measuring the slope of the temperature variation curve, which was \n\nshown to be proportional to the incident heat flux. \n\nRather than using the thick (4 mm) porous steel cylinder used in previous \n\ninstruments, a low thickness (0.1 mm) microperforated plate was used. The \n\nmicroperforated pattern allows a preservation of the transpiration airflow, albeit \n\ninducing a transmissivity component in the overall radiative flux balance that must be \n\ntaken into account. Besides intrinsically lowering the instrument\u2019s response time, the \n\nnew element\u2019s much lower thermal inertia leads to much faster temperature curve \n\nresponses, which in turn allow the switching off of the transpiration airflow for very \n\nbrief times that nevertheless allow a sufficient temperature increase for curve slope \n\ncalculation and total heat flux determination. \n\nThis means that from an operational point of view the instrument can be \n\nthought of mainly as a radiometer, since the default airflow that crosses the sensing \n\nelement is supercritical, i.e. with a mass flux high enough to blow-off the boundary \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nlayer on its outer surface and eliminate convection. That airflow can however be set to \n\nsubcritical values (or even totally shut-off) several times per second in order to enable \n\ntotal heat flux determination without exceeding maximum allowable temperatures, \n\nprovided the data acquisition system has enough time resolution for the purpose. If \n\nthese on-off cycles are short enough, it can be assumed that conditions in the \n\nsurroundings have not changed significantly and heat flux partitioning is achieved \n\nbecause both components of the total heat flux are measured, radiation directly and \n\nconvection by difference between successive total flux and radiation measurements. \n\nThis means that the instrument\u2019s basic operation mode makes use of the protection \n\nafforded by the transpiration gas while still inducing pulses of calculation-enabling \n\ntemperature transients. \n\nOverall dimensions are made smaller in part due to the use of the \n\naforementioned low-thickness microperforated plate, but especially by the use of air \n\nrather than water refrigeration, enabled by the sensing element\u2019s lower thermal inertia. \n\nAn instrument embodying all the principles above was designed, after adequate \n\nanalytical and numerical models were developed and compared, along with further \n\ndimensioning procedures and numerical simulations. Several prototypes were built and \n\ntested with a data acquisition and processing system designed for the purpose. Detailed \n\ncalibration procedures were also developed and proposed. \n\nA patent application was prepared and submitted during the development and \n\ndesign process, the issuing organisation (Instituto Nacional de Propriedade Industial \u2013 \n\nPortuguese National Institute of Industrial Property) having approved the preliminary \n\nreport, having found no impediments to patentability, and issued a provisional patent \n\napplication that must be converted into a definitive patent application,  pending a \n\ndecision to carry on by the administration of the University of Aveiro, as patent co-\n\nproprietor, to be taken until August 1st, 2013 [Calisto and Martins 2012]. \n\n1.5 Thesis Structure \n\nChapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the problem of heat flux measurement and \n\nthe relevance of heat flux as a thermodynamic variable and design parameter. The \n\nthesis\u2019s contribution, objectives and structure are also discussed and its integration in a \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\ncontinuous line of research and development is addressed in order to adequately explain \n\nthe framework in which this work took place. A review of the available methods to \n\nmeasure heat flux, along with a discussion of their relative merits and major \n\nadvantages and disadvantages, is presented. The contribution of the present work is \n\nestablished and discussed by comparison. \n\nChapter 2 provides a review of the relevant physical phenomena that must be \n\ntaken into account during the instrument\u2019s development, namely in the definition of \n\nboth the analytical formulation of its theoretical model and its operational \n\nspecifications. The integration of the analytical treatment of a large number of small \n\nholes with variable physical conditions into a model for heat conduction within the \n\ncylindrical element and its interaction with boundary and initial conditions is not \n\nstraightforward, but is discussed and achieved by treating the cooling effect of the \n\nairflow as a heat sink term. Green\u2019s functions and finite differences are used with the \n\npurpose of obtaining a solution to the boundary value problem resulting from the \n\nphysical conditions of the sensor, including the system\u2019s transient behaviour, its \n\nresponse under various situations being discussed, namely in the simultaneous \n\noccurrence of non-uniform initial temperature fields, the presence of heat sink terms \n\nand non-homogeneous boundary conditions. Solutions are compared with \n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software solutions and the usefulness of the \n\ndeveloped models is discussed. \n\nChapter 3 is a study of dimensional and operational parameters that influence \n\nthe sensor\u2019s performance. Assumptions and simplifications made in the process of \n\ndeveloping the analytical model are discussed, along with the instrument\u2019s \n\ndimensioning and design procedures, taking into account conclusions from the previous \n\nchapter and establishing the procedures necessary for carrying out various analytical \n\nand numerical parametric studies, namely as far as relevant mass flow values, boundary \n\nlayer control, compressibility and transmissivity in the microperforated plate, transient \n\neffects or the external cooling system are concerned.  \n\nChapter 4 is a detailed discussion of the experimental setup and of equipment \n\nselection procedures, along with the presentation and discussion of data acquisition and \n\ncontrol setups. The specifications of the various components that were used in the \n\ncourse of the experimental work are presented, while their integration into the data \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nacquisition and control system are detailed along with implemented methodologies and \n\nprocedures. Special relevance is given to the data processing flow and operations. \n\nMeasurements carried out with the discussed setup are described and relevant \n\ncomparisons with previously developed analytical and numerical models are made \n\nagainst experimental data.

The analytical description of small holes with variable \n\nphysical conditions and their interaction with boundary and initial \n\nconditions into a model for heat conduction is not straightforward, \n\nrendering necessary simplifications in order to yield a compact and \n\nreadily understandable model without loss of detail and accuracy. \n\nPossible approaches are presented and compared with numerical \n\nsimulations performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \n\nmethods, with emphasis on the element\u2019s transient behaviour in \n\nsituations such as the simultaneous occurrence of non-uniform initial \n\ntemperature fields, heat sink terms and non-homogeneous boundary \n\nconditions. The merits of the proposed approaches are discussed, \n\nnamely in terms of potentially reduced computational effort when \n\ncompared to CFD. \n\n \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nUnderlying the present dissertation is the problem of adequately measuring radiative \n\nand convective heat fluxes, either on their own or in combination. Such measurements \n\nmust in some practical cases be performed in relatively short times, both in order to \n\nobtain a fast response for its own sake and to adequately capture possible fast, time-\n\ndependant behaviours.  \n\nThe relative importance of both heat transfer modes may differ, depending on \n\nparticular conditions of each application, but each mode reflects different \n\ncharacteristics of the respective thermodynamic system, regardless of their relative \n\ncontribution. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nBy definition, convective heat transfer depends on the existence of a fluid \n\nstream on the heat transfer surface to be considered, its intensity being directly related \n\nto local parameters such as boundary layer characteristics, fluid properties or local \n\ntemperature differences between fluid and wall. Radiative heat transfer not only does \n\nnot require a physical medium to take place but also has an integral nature (in the \n\nsense that it takes into account exchanges with the global system), depending on the \n\nradiative properties of the participating surfaces and on the temperature difference \n\nbetween them. Any enclosed fluid may also participate in the radiative transfer balance \n\ndepending on its radiative properties and temperature. For these reasons, the \n\nconvective and the radiative heat fluxes may be considered as two different diagnostic \n\nparameters, the first reflecting local conditions while the second reflects global or \n\nintegral conditions.  \n\nIn order to determine the associated heat flux, a total heat flux measurement \n\nproblem can thus be divided in two parts, the first one being the identification of the \n\nrelevant heat transfer modes and the second the analysis of the sensing element \n\nresponse to an energy load. One of the purposes of the instrument to be developed was \n\nprecisely the differentiation between radiative and convective components of the total \n\nheat flux, i.e. performing heat flux partitioning.  \n\nThe study of the relationship between the received heat load and the \n\ntemperature field in the sensing element under known conditions can then be carried \n\nout, the sensor\u2019s thermal behaviour depending on the total heat load and not on the \n\nassociated transfer modes, allowing a separate study of both parts of the overall \n\nproblem. Radiation heat flux measurement is however the most important part of the \n\nproblem from an operational point of view, since the high temperature levels usually \n\nfound in industrial furnaces reduce the relative importance of convective heat flux in \n\nthe overall energy balance analysis. Nevertheless, convective heat flux cannot be \n\nignored since a variety of diagnostic systems rely on total (rather than merely \n\nradiative) heat fluxes as input parameters [Calisto et al. 2008]. \n\nBroadly speaking, any of the radiative flux measurement techniques and \n\napproaches discussed in Chapter 1 could be used. If the environment is clean and \n\nconvection free, the only additional parameter to account for is typically surface \n\nemissivity, since the surface temperature can be known most of the times. The sensing \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nelement surface should therefore be a grey surface with a known emissivity, which must \n\nbe as high as possible in order to increase the instrument sensitivity.  \n\nObviously, if measurements are carried out in the presence of convective heat \n\nfluxes, some precautions are required in order to prevent the radiative component from \n\nbeing contaminated by convective contributions. If the environment is not clean, \n\ntypically if there is particulate matter in suspension, fouling on the sensing element \n\nsurface must be prevented since it will affect its radiative properties and render its \n\ncalibration curves useless.  \n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 1, a usual technique for the avoidance of the \n\nconvective component of the total heat flux is the addition of a special transparent \n\nwindow to the gauge, protecting the sensing element from contact with the gas stream. \n\nThis procedure effectively eliminates the convection component of the total heat flux \n\nand an appropriate selection of the window material renders the attenuation of the \n\nradiative component negligible, but the instrument view angle is typically reduced.  \n\nThis is the main reason for the use of a gas screen around the sensing element \n\nto avoid fouling on the sensor surface, with air or nitrogen being blown through specific \n\nslots around the sensing element or through the element itself if it is porous or \n\nperforated. The gas screen\u2019s cooling effect on the sensing element not only also affects \n\nthe sensor\u2019s output but can be made a central feature of its operation mode, as \n\ndiscussed below in further detail.  \n\nIn most studies involving radiometers the output of the instrument has to be \n\nobtained in steady state conditions, for which a variety of theoretical models are \n\navailable. However, reliable steady-state data are usually not enough within the \n\nframework of advanced diagnostic systems, since for certain measurement applications \n\nit is also very important to record dynamic characteristics such as the transient \n\nresponse of the instrument. If the results are to be obtained in transient conditions, this \n\nresponse time must be considerably shorter.  \n\nAs explained in Chapter 1, this was one of the main driving forces behind the \n\npresent work and a suitable theoretical formulation is necessary. Such a formulation \n\nwas developed by Martins [Martins 1998] in his PhD thesis, leading to an operational \n\nheat flux meter, tested in industrial conditions, its formulation, specifications and \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nperformance being discussed in subsequent publications that are evidence of a rugged \n\nand reliable radiometer [Martins et al. 1998, Martins et al. 2000].  \n\nFouling was shown to be avoided thanks to the transpiration air flow, although \n\nlarge response times (up to 5 s) were observed. While adequate for a wide range of \n\napplications, the integration of such an instrument in systems that exhibit strongly \n\ntime-dependant and fast behaviours could be hindered by high response times. The \n\ninstrument was also bulky due to its refrigeration system. Gas turbines come to mind \n\nas examples of systems that require fast-response instruments due to the speed at \n\nwhich they operate and which render slow-responding sensors inappropriate and have \n\nrestrictions regarding the bulkiness and weight of any subsystem. \n\nRelevant differences exist between the aforementioned instrument and the one \n\ndeveloped, designed and discussed here, especially as far as the sensing element is \n\nconcerned. A relatively thick porous steel cylinder was used in the older version, its \n\nhigh thermal inertia compensated to some extent by the advantage of collecting the \n\ntotality of the thermal radiation incident on the surface, no thermal radiation escaping \n\nto the inner side of the gauge body due to the non-existent transmissivity of the porous \n\nelement. \n\nThe low thickness microperforated (in order to preserve the transpiration \n\nairflow) plate proposed in the version discussed here does induce a transmissivity \n\ncomponent in the overall radiative flux balance that must be taken into account, but  \n\nlowers the instrument\u2019s response time and makes for much faster temperature curve \n\nresponses, which in turn allow the switching off of the transpiration airflow for very \n\nbrief times that nevertheless allow a sufficient temperature increase for curve slope \n\ncalculation and total heat flux determination. \n\nDifferences also exist in terms of the interaction of the sensing element with the \n\ntranspiration gas, rendering the model based on energy balances inadequate to describe \n\nthe microperforated plates\u2019 behaviour. The presence of a large number of small holes \n\nwith variable physical conditions (i.e. temperatures) must be accounted for in a model \n\nfor heat conduction within the cylindrical element and its interaction with boundary \n\nand initial conditions. This is not straightforward but can be achieved by treating the \n\ncooling effect of the airflow as a heat sink term, as described below. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nFurther refinements were discussed in subsequent articles [Martins et al. 1998, \n\nMartins et al. 2000], namely a fully transient formulation [Martins 1998] that allowed \n\nfor an extension of the instrument\u2019s application range by opening the way to achieving \n\na faster response and eventually heat flux partitioning.  \n\nIn the first subsequent experimental approaches, necessary transient behaviours \n\nwere induced by varying the incident heat flux, exposing and masking the sensing \n\nelement with a shutter. The transpiration airflow was kept at a steady value while \n\nseveral furnace set points were considered. The exposition of the sensing element to the \n\nhot furnace would lead to an increase in temperature and a direct proportionality \n\nbetween the slope of the line tangent to the temperature response curve and the \n\nincident heat flux was established, with the same slope being observed in the linear \n\nportion of the curve for the same heat fluxes regardless of the initial temperature [Hit \n\n2004]. This meant that it is unnecessary to \u201cwait\u201d for steady-state values and that the \n\ntransient output of the radiometer can be used to determine the incident heat flux \n\n[Martins et al. 2006a, Martins et al. 2006b]. These conclusions led directly to the work \n\npresented in the present document. \n\nA noteworthy difference between the aforementioned experimental studies and \n\nthe proposed operational mode has to do with how the transient behaviours are \n\ninduced, since in the present case a pulsed transpiration gas mass flow is to be used, \n\nthis option holding more promise since on/off control through the use of fast-response \n\nelectrovalves is easier and faster to implement than the use of a front shutter. The \n\nelectrovalve typically controls two distinct transpiration mass flow levels: a maximum \n\nvalue that ensures boundary layer blow-off and allows sufficient cooling for the sensing \n\nelement, and a much lower value that lets some hot gases reach the sensor and that \n\ncan even be set to a zero value if instrument protection (both in terms of fouling and \n\nthermal levels) is not compromised. This does introduce significant differences with the \n\naforementioned earlier studies. In those cases the lower temperature level was reached \n\nwith the transpiration airflow switched-on but without instrument exposure to the hot \n\nsource (effectively reproducing a cold experiment, as discussed in Chapter 4), and \n\ntemperatures only rose when the instrument was placed in the furnace, without \n\nvariation in the transpiration airflow. This meant that the temperature increase was \n\nsolely due to the incoming heat flux, no discussion being made in terms of heat flux \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\npartitioning, although the magnitude of the transpiration airflows used and that were \n\nalso necessary for sensing element thermal protection/refrigeration purposes would \n\ncorrespond to situations where the boundary layer would be blown-off and only \n\nradiative heat fluxes would be measured. This would also explain the fact that the \n\nslopes of the transient temperature curves were the same in the heating and cooling \n\nprocesses, since the driving force behind them would be the presence or absence of the \n\nincoming heat flux, given the constant transpiration airflow [Hit 2004]. \n\nThe pulsed transpiration mass flow principle means that when the airflow is \n\nturned on above a critical value the instrument will behave like a conventional \n\ntranspiration radiometer. In such conditions the temperature measured by the \n\nthermocouple attached to the perforated plate will be a steady-state equilibrium value \n\ndictated by the incoming radiation heat flux and the cooling provided by the \n\ntranspiration airflow. The situation where the airflow is switched-off and the boundary \n\nlayer will no longer be blown-off, however, will present a dramatic increase in measured \n\ntemperature that is driven not only by the presence of a convective component in \n\naddition to the radiative component that was already present, but also by the absence \n\nof transpiration cooling in the sensing element. This process would lead to a steady-\n\nstate value that would be reached if temperatures were allowed to increase and \n\nstabilize, and would indeed be proportional to the total received heat flux. \n\nNevertheless, the slope of the transient temperature curve at the start of the pulse \n\n(hence the zero value for time) would still be proportional to the incoming heat flux: \n\n \n\n \ntotal\n\n0\n\nd\nd\n\nt\n\nT\nq\n\nt\n?\n\n=\n\n= .  (2.1) \n\n \n\nThe analysis of the transient response is intended precisely to avoid reaching \n\nsuch high temperatures, which would not enable the convenient assumption of a \n\ncomparatively insignificant plate emission term and most importantly could severely \n\ndamage components and their weldings and attachments. If the process is carried out in \n\na sufficiently rapid fashion, the radiative component of the heat flux can be treated as \n\nconstant and the convective component can be estimated. A calibration of the transient \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\ntranspiration radiometer would thus involve the determination of the proportionality \n\nconstant ? for various incident heat fluxes. \n\nWhen the transpiration airflow is reset at its initial mass flux, the transient \n\ntemperature curve will decrease back towards its initial value dictated by the incident \n\nradiative flux but especially by the transpiration airflow, at a rate (i.e. slope) that will \n\nbe a function of the magnitude of both factors and that can also be quantified. \n\n2.2 Model Requirements and Analytical Approach \n\n2.2.1 Problem Statement \n\nThe problem of obtaining a formulation for an instrument sensitive element is \n\nessentially one of conduction within the element\u2019s solid material, which can be assumed \n\nto be homogeneous in terms of composition and properties, with temperature fields \n\nresulting from convective, radiative and imposed temperature boundary conditions.  \n\nIn a solid body in which temperature differences occur, heat flow can be thought \n\nof as the rate of energy transfer (in Js-1) associated with the vibrational energy of atoms \n\nand molecules in the body, and heat flux is the heat flow per unit area at any point of \n\nthe body. As mentioned earlier it cannot be measured directly but its effects can be \n\nobserved on the surroundings, as in the melting of ice or the vaporization of water. \n\nInside a solid body, the heat flux can be determined from the temperature distribution \n\nonly if the relationship between temperature and heat flux is thoroughly understood. In \n\na solid body with a steady temperature gradient, heat flux has a magnitude and a \n\ndirection and is usually denoted as q\n?\n. The component of heat flux (in Wm-2) for \n\ndirection x is for example: \n\n \n\n \n''\n\nx\n\nT\nkq\n\nx\n\n?\n= ?\n\n?\n,  (2.2) \n\n \n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity in Wm-1K-1 and the negative sign implies that heat \n\nalways flows in the direction of reducing temperature and \n''\n\nx x\nq Aq=  is the heat rate (in \n\nW) and A is the heat transfer area. In cartesian coordinates the other heat flux \n\ncomponents are: \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n'' ''\n\n and \ny z\n\nT T\nk kq q\n\ny z\n\n? ?\n= ? = ?\n\n? ?\n,  (2.3) \n\n \n\nembodying Fourier\u2019s law of heat conduction, which applies to bodies that are \n\nhomogeneous (i.e. with the same substance overall), isotropic (heat flow with equal \n\nease in any direction) and of macroscale size. \n\nFor a three-dimensional cylindrical system such as the sensor element, the heat \n\ndiffusion equation is readily available in most of the heat transfer literature references, \n\nincluding the most widespread [Holman 1986, Incropera and DeWitt 1996]. This is \n\nadequate for any given solid with heat conduction, and where surface phenomena (i.e. \n\nconvection and radiation) are boundary conditions for the differential equation to be \n\nobtained. The form of the heat diffusion equation, when transient conduction and heat \n\ngeneration/sink terms (denoted as g, in Wm-3) are considered, can be given as: \n\n \n\n \np2\n\n1 1T T T T\nkr k k g c\n\nr r r z z tr\n?\n\n? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?+ + + =? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ?\n  (2.4) \n\n \n\nor, for constant k \n\n \n\n \n2 2 2\n\n2 2 2 2\n\n1 1 1T T T T g T\nr r k tr r z ??\n\n? ? ? ? ?\n+ + + + =\n\n? ?? ? ?\n.  (2.5) \n\n \n\nSpatial coordinates are r in the radial direction, ? in the angular or azimuthal \n\ndirection and z along the cylindrical axis or cylinder thickness. Density ? (kgm-3) and \n\nspecific heat cp (Jkg\n-1K-1) can be grouped as the material\u2019s thermal diffusivity ?. The \n\naforementioned references do not usually present any form of deduction for this \n\nequation, typically restricting themselves to the deduction of the cartesian case and \n\nleaving the cylindrical coordinates problem as a mere exercise. The deduction of the \n\nappropriate form of the heat equation is nevertheless rather straightforward and useful \n\nin the definition of an adequate mathematical model for the sensor, given its cylindrical \n\nshape. Some simplifications must be made at this point in order to obtain a viable \n\nmodel for the sensor, as discussed below. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nThe differential equation of heat conduction does not describe the temperature \n\ndistribution in a region and will have numerous solutions unless a set of boundary \n\nconditions and an initial condition for a time-dependant problem are prescribed. The \n\nmathematical form of the solutions to heat conduction equations is determined by the \n\nboundary conditions, i.e. the value of the temperature (or its derivative) at the \n\nboundaries of the heat conducting body. The combination of an energy equation, \n\nspecific boundary conditions and an initial condition is called a boundary value \n\nproblem. In this particular case the body has an orthogonal geometry, which means \n\nthat its boundaries are located where one coordinate is a constant, such as the outer \n\nradius of the cylinder. \n\nInitial conditions usually specify a temperature distribution in a medium at the \n\norigin of the time coordinate, that is, t = 0, while boundary conditions describe what \n\nphysically takes place at the boundaries of the region. The number of boundary \n\nconditions for a boundary value problem depends on the form of the energy equation \n\nand the geometry of the system under consideration. On a given surface, temperature \n\nor heat flux distributions can be specified, or there may be exchanges by convection \n\nand/or radiation, the boundary condition being derived by performing an energy \n\nbalance on the surface. The non-linear radiation term can be troublesome to obtain in \n\nsome analytical approaches. Boundary conditions are often defined by specifying either \n\ntemperature or heat flux distributions on surface S in the well-know forms of: \n\n\u2022 Dirichlet (or first kind boundary conditions) in which a temperature \n\ndistribution is prescribed at the boundary surface, that is: \n \n\n ( ),  on T f r t S= ?   \n \n\nwhere the prescribed surface temperature ( ),f r t?  is in general a function \nof position and time, and the special case: \n\n \n\n 0 on T S=   \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nis called the homogenous boundary condition of the first kind, r\n?\n being a \n\ngeneric position vector, defined as adequate for each particular \n\napplication. \n\n\u2022 Neumann (or second kind boundary conditions) in which a heat flux \n\ndistribution is prescribed at the boundary surface, i.e.: \n \n\n ( ),  on Tk f r t S\nn\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n?\n\n  \n\n \n\nwhere T n? ?  is the derivative along the outward drawn normal of the \n\nsurface and ( ),f r t?  is the prescribed heat flux in Wm-2, the special case \n \n\n 0 on \nT\n\nk S\nn\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n  \n\n \n\n being called the homogenous boundary condition of the second kind. \n\n\u2022 Robin/Fourier (or third kind boundary conditions) in which a heat \n\ntransfer coefficient is specified and can be obtained by setting radiation \n\nand heat supply terms to zero, that is: \n \n\n ( ),  on Tk hT hT r t S\nn\n\n?\n\n?\n+ =\n\n?\n?\n\n  \n\n \n\nwhere for generality ambient temperature ( ),T r t?\n?\n\n is assumed to be a \n\nfunction of position and time. The special case: \n\n \n\n 0 on \nT\n\nk hT S\nn\n\n?\n+ =\n\n?\n  \n\n \n\nis called the homogenous boundary condition of the third kind. \n\nAdditional boundary conditions (fourth and fifth kinds) can be defined for \n\nvarious physical situations such as interfaces and convection or radiation fluxes, but \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nthese are not always practical to use for analytical purposes since they require the \n\nspecification of surroundings\u2019 (either fluids or surfaces) temperatures. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the features of previous versions of the sensor that \n\nwas felt to be the most perfectible was its response time, which in turn led to the \n\nrequirement of lowering its thermal inertia. The idea of using a metallic foil much \n\nthinner than the original porous steel disc came about naturally as a means of \n\nobtaining a much lower thermal inertia, while the option for a microperforated pattern \n\nenables a much more precise control of element geometry and physical properties when \n\ncompared to the porous steel disc, without compromising the transpiration gas flow. \n\nThis is essential since the transpiration gas pulses are central to the envisioned \n\noperational principle, for two main reasons.  \n\nOn the one hand, various changes in intensity of these pulses\u2019 mass flow rate \n\nwill provide transient temperature variations with varying slopes that can be related to \n\nthe incident heat fluxes. On the other hand, sufficiently high mass flows will be \n\nresponsible for enabling the instrument to operate purely as a radiometer, by blowing \n\noff the boundary layer on the sensing element\u2019s exposed face and thus eliminating the \n\nconvection heat flux component. As mentioned earlier, this would be done in a periodic \n\nfashion in order to allow for the separation of the components of the total heat flux.  \n\nIt is therefore essential to take into account the effects of the air flow pulse \n\nwhen developing any analytical description of the sensing element being exposed to \n\nincident heat fluxes and crossed by a comparatively cold mass flow. It is however \n\nobvious that a detailed accounting of a large number of small perforated holes \n\ndistributed across the metallic element would be rather difficult to implement in purely \n\nanalytical terms. The cooling effect of the transpiration mass flow and transient effects \n\ndue to variations in that flow can be more sensibly described through the definition of a \n\nheat sink term (i.e. a negative generation component) in the basic differential equation. \n\nAssuming that azimuthal symmetry can be considered and that the temperature \n\ngradient across the element\u2019s thickness must be considered, a more versatile model is \n\nobtained and can be readily simplified if this gradient can be ignored, depending on \n\nwhich particular thicknesses are to be considered. In this case, the heat equation: \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n2\n\n1 1 1T T T g T\nr\n\nr r r z z k tr ? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?+ + + =? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ?\n  (2.6) \n\n \n\ncan be simplified to become: \n\n \n\n \n1 1T T g T\n\nr\nr r r z z k t?\n\n? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?+ + =? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n  (2.7) \n\n \n\nsince azimuthal (i.e. angular) variations are not to be considered. This is a first-order \n\npartial differential equation with respect to time and second-order partial differential \n\nequation with respect to the spatial coordinates r and z. An initial condition is \n\ntherefore required for the temporal variation, which can be as simple as a constant \n\ninitial temperature when time equals zero, or: \n\n \n\n ( ), , 0 iT r z t T= = .  (2.8) \n \n\nThis condition would correspond to a situation where the sensor was not \n\nexposed to any incident heat fluxes or transpiration gas flows, and the temperature \n\nover the whole element would be either that of the surroundings or one imposed by an \n\nexternal refrigeration system. Other situations would involve situations where a more \n\ncomplex (in the sense that it would not be constant in space) initial temperature field \n\nwould be in existence at the moment where any given effect must be evaluated. This \n\ncould be a situation where an initial equilibrium resulting from incident heat fluxes and \n\nthe imposed temperature would be disturbed by a variation in the transpiration gas \n\nflow. \n\nBoundary conditions must then be specified in spatial terms in order to allow \n\nfor the solution of the spatial component of the problem. A cylindrical element with \n\nradius b and thickness c is considered to be exposed to an incident heat flux qinc at       \n\nz = c. The precise nature of this flux is not known beforehand so it can, as a first \n\napproximation, be considered merely as an imposed heat flux rather than being \n\nspecified as either convection, radiation or combined boundary conditions. At z = 0 the \n\nelement being heated by heat flux qinc will lose heat by an undetermined proportion of \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nconvection and radiation to the tube that supplies the airflow and is assumed to be at a \n\nlower temperature. This heat flux is designated qem. The outer radial surface at r = b is \n\nmaintained at a temperature T = Text. \n\nFor generality it can be assumed that both the sink term g(r,z,t) and the flux \n\nboundary conditions qem(r) and qinc(r) vary with position and time. This spatial \n\nvariation will be the case to be considered in some situations, while several \n\nsimplifications can be introduced in other situations, namely time-independent heat \n\nfluxes.  \n\nThe literature states that non-homogenous boundary conditions may give rise to \n\nconvergence difficulties when the solution is evaluated near the boundary. Thus, \n\nwhenever possible, it is desirable to transform non-homogenous boundary conditions \n\ninto homogenous ones [\u00d6zisik 1993]. This could be achieved by performing a variable \n\nchange in the form ? = T - Text and solving the heat equation for the new variable, the \n\nnon-homogenous boundary condition T - Text at r = b being rendered homogeneous in \n\nthe form ? = 0 at r = b and with all remaining boundary conditions and the heat \n\nequation adjusted accordingly. This could however render performing surface radiation \n\nbalances more complicated. In these conditions, the differential conduction equation \n\ncan be written as: \n\n \n\n ( )\n2 2\n\n2 2\n\n1 1 1\n, ,\n\nT T T T\ng r z t\n\nr r k tr z ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n+ + + =\n\n? ?? ?\n  (2.9) \n\n \n\nin 0 ? r ? b and 0 ? z ? c for t > 0 with boundary conditions: \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\n( )\n\next\n\nem\n\ninc\n\next\n\n0 at 0\n\n at \n\n at 0\n\n at \n\n, ,  at 0\n\nT\nr\n\nr\n\nT T r b\n\nT\nq z\n\nz\n\nT\nq z c\n\nz\n\nT r z t T t\n\n?\n= =\n\n?\n\n= =\n\n?\n= =\n\n?\n\n?\n= =\n\n?\n\n= =\n\n   (2.10) \n\n \n\nThe imposition of an incoming heat flux may be debatable in purely physical \n\nterms, since the heat flux at that boundary is the result of the balance between \n\nsurroundings and gas temperatures on the one hand and the surface temperature on the \n\nother, especially when radiation is to be considered.  \n\nThe assumption of a fixed incoming, radiation-dominated heat flux can be \n\nconsidered reasonable if the contribution of the emission component of the surface \n\nbalance is kept low when compared to the incident radiation component, which can be \n\nachieved if surface temperatures are likewise kept as low as possible. This assumption \n\nof an imposed incoming radiation heat flux is furthermore justified by the use of the \n\ntranspiration principle, which implies that for sufficiently high transpiration mass flows \n\nthe convective heat transfer is eliminated which, as mentioned in detail later, will \n\ncorrespond to a situation to be encountered for most of the instrument\u2019s operation time \n\nand will result in a purely radiative boundary condition. \n\nFor any given set of conditions in the high-temperature environment, high \n\ntranspiration gas flows are required in order to lower surface temperatures, diminishing \n\nthe magnitude of radial flows within the sensing element (overall temperatures being \n\ncloser to the temperature imposed on the outer radius) and rendering the emission term \n\nmuch less significant. This principle was already applied to nullify these terms in \n\nenergy balances for sensing elements of previous versions of the instrument [Martins \n\n1998]. High gas flows also have other advantages such as a more effective deflection of \n\nincoming soot particles, with the lower temperatures placing less severe thermal \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nconstraints on the outer refrigeration system, and the welding between the \n\nthermocouples and the microperforated plate. \n\nIt should be noted that the incident heat flux to be considered is not necessarily \n\nthe overall flux due to the conditions surrounding the outer surface of the element, \n\nbecause of its microperforated pattern and its non-specular surface. While convective \n\nexchanges are not significantly altered compared with those for a non-perforated \n\nsurface, other than by the difference in surface area, radiative exchanges can be \n\nsubstantially different due to transmission and reflection phenomena. \n\nThe spectral irradiation G\n?\n (typically in Wm-2\u00b5m-1) that strikes a \n\nsemitransparent medium surface can be reflected, absorbed or transmitted in diverse \n\nproportions, following from a radiation balance that: \n\n \n\n \n,ref ,abs ,tr\n\nG G G G\n? ? ? ?\n= + + .  (2.11) \n\n \n\nThe determination of these components is in general complex, depending on the \n\nupper and lower surface conditions, the wavelength of the radiation and the \n\ncomposition and thickness of the medium, where volumetric effects can strongly \n\ninfluence conditions. If total rather than spectral (i.e. integrated over the whole \n\nspectrum), hemispherical components are assumed, reflectivity ?rad, absortivity ?rad and \n\ntransmissivity ?rad yield: \n\n \n\n \nrad rad rad\n\n1? ? ?+ + =   (2.12) \n\n \n\nthe subscript \u201crad\u201d being present to avoid confusions with density ? and thermal \n\ndiffusivity ?. \n\nWhile most solids are opaque and have zero transmissivity, the microperforated \n\nplate has a non-zero value which must be taken into account. From Kirchhoff\u2019s law, it \n\nwill also be assumed that the total, hemispherical absortivity of the surface is equal to \n\nits total hemispherical emissivity ?.  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nIf the temperature of the sensing element surface exposed to the hot \n\nsurroundings responsible for the incoming radiation is kept low enough to make \n\nconsidering its radiative emission negligible, this means that the qinc heat flux \n\nconsidered as a boundary condition can be regarded as the incident radiative (and if \n\npresent, convective) heat fluxes minus the transmitted and reflected radiative \n\ncomponents. \n\nThe achievement of low surface temperatures on the sensing element, which \n\ngiven the element\u2019s low thickness and consequent lack of thermal gradients along its \n\nsymmetry axis is the same as keeping the element\u2019s temperature low over its whole \n\nvolume, is therefore important in terms of simplicity of analysis: low surface \n\ntemperatures ensure that the emission term is negligible when the difference to the \n\nsurroundings is large, as is typical in boilers and furnaces. \n\nAddressing once more the formulation, in this case the transient heat \n\nconduction problem is non-homogenous because of the non-homogeneity of the \n\ndifferential equation (due to the generation term) and/or the boundary conditions.  \n\nHeat conduction problems described by non-homogenous partial differential \n\nequations and boundary conditions can be handled with more or less difficulty by a \n\nvariety of techniques, from orthogonal expansion to Laplace transforms or Green\u2019s \n\nfunctions (GF) [Carslaw and Jaeger 1959, Arpaci 1966, \u00d6zisik 1993]. A homogeneous \n\ndifferential equation is a linear equation where all terms include either the dependent \n\nfunction or one of its derivatives, while a non-homogeneous equation includes a term \n\nthat is a function of only the independent variable. Similarly, a boundary condition is \n\nhomogeneous when the dependent variable or its derivatives, or any linear combination \n\nof the dependent variable or its derivatives, vanishes at the boundary. \n\nThe orthogonal expansion and separation of variables technique is arguably the \n\nmost common, having extensively been presented and discussed in most of the standard \n\nreferences on heat conduction, with some claiming that it is the proper way of solving \n\nthis type of heat conduction problems [Arpaci 1966, \u00d6zisik 1968]. Its application can be \n\ndifficult to handle when non-homogenous boundary conditions are present because this \n\npresence gives rise to convergence difficulties when the solution is evaluated near the \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nboundary. So, whenever possible, it is desirable to transform non-homogenous into \n\nhomogenous boundary conditions.  \n\nThe non-homogeneous generation term is also typically handled if the problem \n\nis split into a set of simpler problems, which can be done if the generation term and the \n\nnon-homogenous part of the boundary condition do not depend on time [\u00d6zisik 1993].  \n\nThis is usually achieved by splitting the overall problem for the T(r,z,t) temperature \n\ndistribution into a steady-state problem that contains the non-homogenous components \n\nand is solved for TST(r,z), and a homogenous transient problem solved for THM(r,z t), \n\nwith the T(r,z,t) solution for the original problem being given by: \n\n \n\n ( ) ST HM, , ( , , )T r z t T T r z t= +   (2.13) \n \n\nThis formulation becomes increasingly complex for two- or three-dimensional \n\ngeometries and with increasing numbers of non-homogeneous boundary conditions. \n\nLaplace transforms are also commonly used but present the problem of the existence of \n\nan inverse transform not always being guarantied [\u00d6zisik 1993]. \n\nAn immense number of analytical solutions for conduction heat transfer \n\nproblems have been accumulated over the years. Even so, in many practical situations \n\nthe geometry or boundary conditions are such that an analytical solution has not been \n\nobtained at all or else involves such a complex solution procedure that numerical \n\nevaluation becomes too cumbersome or difficult. As discussed below, in these situations \n\nother approaches may be more fruitful, finite-difference methods readily coming to \n\nmind as the most common and widespread example, with the basics of the method \n\nbeing readily available even in the most basic heat transfer manuals [Holman 1986, \n\nIncropera and DeWitt 1996]. \n\nIn any case, the difficulty of treating the microperforated patterns as heat sink \n\nterms and integrating the presence of this non-homogeneous term must be dealt with, \n\ndictating to a large extent the most reasonable options in terms of analytical approach \n\nand complexity. The procedure implemented for calculation of the temperature fields \n\nusing both the GF and finite differences methods nevertheless has some similarities, \n\nboth approaches being highly structured and methodical processes. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Green\u2019s Functions Formulation \n\nMethods based on the use of Green\u2019s Functions (GF) are viable alternatives, being \n\nflexible, powerful, and especially well-suited for these particular applications given the \n\nfact that the same GF for a given geometry is a building block for determining the \n\ntemperature distribution for situations such as a space-variable initial temperature \n\ndistribution and time- and space-variable boundary conditions or volume energy \n\ngeneration/removal [Carslaw and Jaeger 1959, Stakgold 1967, \u00d6zisik 1993, Cole et al. \n\n2010]. This method can be viewed as a restatement of a boundary value problem into \n\nintegral form and is useful if the GF is known (or can be found), and if the integral \n\nexpressions can be evaluated. If these two limitations can be overcome, the GF method \n\noffers several other advantages such as systematic solution procedure due to GF \n\nlibraries being available, saving time and reducing the possibility of error, which is \n\nparticularly important for two- and three-dimensional geometries. For complex \n\nproblems in which the heat conduction is caused by several non-homogeneous terms, \n\nthe effect of each term can be considered separately. The GF method leads to \n\nanalytical solutions in the form of integrals, the solution taking the form of a \n\nsuperposition (sum) of several integrals, one for each non-homogeneous term in the \n\nproblem. \n\nTwo- and three-dimensional transient GF can be found by simple multiplication \n\nof one-dimensional transient GF for the rectangular coordinate system for most \n\nboundary conditions, provided that the body is homogeneous and orthogonal. This \n\nmultiplicative property can result in great simplification in the derivation of the \n\ntemperature, as well as providing a very compact means of cataloguing the GF in these \n\ncases. For cylindrical coordinates, the multiplicative property of the GF applies to \n\ncertain two-dimensional geometries, which is a further factor of attraction in the \n\nparticular case under discussion. \n\nSeveral books give a good overview of the GF method [Carslaw and Jaeger \n\n1959, Stakgold 1967, \u00d6zisik 1993, Duffy 2001]. Of special interest is another reference \n\n(that has recently been updated in its second edition), presenting an overview of the \n\nGF method and giving extensive tables of GF for heat conduction and diffusion. These \n\nare organized with a number system for the number of spatial dimensions, the type of \n\ncoordinate system and the type of boundary conditions, most of the book being devoted \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nto transient heat conduction and convergence improvement procedures [Cole et al. \n\n2010]. \n\nOther references have similar objectives to the work presented here, applying \n\nGF to heat conduction applications in the context of sensor development applications \n\n[Beck and Keltner 1987, Cole 2004], including in full cylindrical geometries, or the \n\nbehaviour and temperature fields of structures in very high temperature environments, \n\nsuch as fires [Beck and Keltner 1987, Cole 2004, Wang et al. 2005, Wang and Tan \n\n2007a, Wang and Tan 2007b]. \n\nMost references focus their analyses on very particular applications in which \n\nsome convenient simplifications can be made, either by considering uniform initial \n\ntemperature fields, the lack of generation/heat sink terms, homogeneous boundary \n\nconditions or steady-state situations. The ultimate aim of the work described here is to \n\nestablish the formalism necessary to study an azimuthally symmetrical cylindrical \n\ngeometry in which all these matters must be considered simultaneously, which leads to \n\nthe matter of establishing the requirements of the model to be developed. \n\nThe aforementioned pulsed operation principle dictates that the model must \n\ndescribe the effect of the various mass flows to be considered, especially as far as \n\ntemperature fields within the disk and its time response are concerned. The latter is \n\nfundamental since received heat fluxes were, as mentioned earlier, proven to be directly \n\nproportional to the slope of the tangent to the temperature response curve which, in \n\nturn, allows an anticipation of the instrument\u2019s steady-state values. \n\nArguably the main conceptual difficulty in the passage from the actual physical \n\nsystem to its analytical description is, in this case, taking into account the \n\nmicroperforated pattern that underlies the transpiration radiometer principle, in order \n\nto evaluate the effect of the various mass flows that will cross the plate. As mentioned \n\nearlier, the presence of a large number of small holes with variable physical conditions \n\nis not straightforward but can be achieved by treating the cooling effect of the airflow \n\nas a heat sink term. \n\nThe usefulness of GF lies in the fact that once one such function is known the \n\ntemperature distribution ( ),T r t?  in the medium is readily computed by the Green\u2019s \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nFunction Solution Equation (GFSE). In the case of the original three-dimensional \n\ntransient, non-homogeneous heat conduction and for constant material thermal \n\nproperties, the solution for ( ),T r t?  is expressed in terms of the three-dimensional GF \n\n( ), | ,G r t r t?? ?  as: \n \n\n \n\n( )\n\n( )\n\n( )\n' '\n\n' ' '\n\nReg\n\n' ' '\n\n0 Reg\n\n' '\n\n0\n1\n\n'\n\n'0\n1\n\n, ( , | , 0) ( )d\n\n( , | , ) ( , )d d\n\n,\n( , | , )d d\n\n, d d\n\ni\n\nj\n\nj\n\nt\n\nst\ni i\n\ni i\nS\n\ni\n\nst\n\nj j j\nS\n\nj j r r\n\nT r t G r t r F r v\n\nG r t r g r v\nk\n\nf r\nG r t r s\n\nk\n\nG\nf r s\n\nn\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n? ? ?\n\n?\n? ? ?\n\n? ? ?\n\n=\n\n=\n=\n\n=\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n\n?? ?\n\n?? ?\n? ?\n\n? ? ?\n\n? ? ?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n?\n\n  (2.14) \n\n \n\nwhere Reg refers to the entire volume of the region considered, Si refers to the \n\nboundary surfaces of the region Reg, i = 1, 2, ..., N where boundary conditions of the \n\nsecond through fifth kinds are applied, Sj refers to the boundary surfaces of the region \n\nReg, j = 1, 2, ..., N where boundary conditions of the first kind are applied, and N is \n\nthe number of continuous boundary surfaces. Differential volume and surface elements \n\nin the 'r\n?\n variable are 'dv , 'd\n\ni\ns  and 'd\n\nj\ns  respectively. The physical significance of the \n\nvarious terms in second member of the equation above is: \n\n\u2022 The first term is for the contribution of the initial condition function \n\n( )'F r?  on the temperature distribution; that is, GF '( , | , )G r t r ?? ?\n\nevaluated for ? = 0 is multiplied by ( )'F r? and integrated over the whole \nregion Reg; \n\n\u2022 The second term is for the contribution of energy generation ( ),g r t? on \ntemperature ( ),T r t? , that is, GF '( , | , )G r t r ?? ? multiplied by ( ),g r t?  and \nintegrated over the whole region Reg and over the time from ? = 0 to t; \n\n\u2022 The third term represents the contribution of the non-homogeneous \n\nterms ( ),i if r ?\n?\n\n of the boundary conditions on the temperature, for \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nboundary conditions of the second through the fifth kinds. It consists of \n\nthe GF evaluated at the boundary, multiplied by ( ),i if r ?\n?\n\n and integrated \n\nover the whole boundary surface and over the time from ? = 0 to t; \n\n\u2022 The last term represents the contribution of the non-homogeneous terms \n\n( ),j jf r ?\n?\n\nof the boundary conditions on the temperature, for boundary \n\nconditions of the first kind. The benefit of rendering homogeneous the \n\nimposed temperature condition at r = a becomes apparent, since this \n\nlast term would vanish and possible convergence issues near the \n\nboundary would be addressed. \n\nAs mentioned above, once the GF is known, the temperature distribution \n\n( ),T r t?  in the medium is readily computed. Therefore, the establishment of the proper \nGF for any given situation is an integral part of the solution methodology using this \n\napproach. GF can be obtained by various techniques such as Laplace transforms or the \n\nmethod of images, but the simplest, straightforward and general approach uses the \n\nclassic separation of variables technique for determining GF [Carslaw and Jaeger 1959, \n\n\u00d6zisik 1993, Cole et al. 2010]. \n\nThe number of exact solutions in transient heat conduction and diffusion is \n\nextremely large and growing. Thus, numbering systems were devised in order to \n\norganize them while the numbers themselves can convey explicit meaning and contain a \n\ngreat deal of information. Arguably the most handy system was proposed in 1985 \n\n([Beck and Litkouhi 1985], with further discussion [Beck 1984, Beck 1986]) allowing for \n\na less tedious solution location procedure and a lesser effort in developing new solutions \n\nand simplifying the construction of a computer database in the form of the Green\u2019s \n\nFunctions Library [Cole 2000]. \n\nThe numbering system makes it easier to keep track of the different possible \n\ncombinations of boundary conditions and the GF associated with them. In cylindrical \n\ncoordinates with azimuthal symmetry a specific GF is identified by a \u201cnumber\u201d of the \n\nform R0JZKL, in which R and Z represent the coordinate axes, and the letters \n\nfollowing each axis name take on values 1 (Dirichlet condition, prescribed \n\ntemperature), 2 (Neumann condition, prescribed heat flux), or 3 (Robin convective \n\ncondition) to represent the type of boundary conditions present at the body faces \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nnormal to that axis. Some references also list type 4 (Carslaw condition, thin film with \n\nno convection) and 5 (Jaeger condition, thin film with convection) boundary conditions \n\n[Cole et al. 2010]. \n\nNumber 0 is also used to denote the lack of a physical boundary: designation \n\nR02 represents a solid cylinder (no physical boundary at r = 0) with a boundary \n\ncondition of type 2 at r = a. Number R01Z13 describes a GF for a solid cylinder with \n\nthe following boundary information: no physical boundary at r = 0, the curved face at \n\nr = a has a type 1 boundary (G = 0), the face at z = 0 has a type 1 boundary and the \n\nz = L face has a type 3 boundary (convection) [Cole 2004, Cole et al. 2010]. The \n\nnumbering system is also able to account for time- and space-variable boundary \n\nconditions, initial temperature distributions, interfaces and generation/sink terms [Cole \n\net al. 2010]. \n\nFor the case under discussion the solid cylinder will have a R01 numbering in \n\nthe radial direction, illustrating the facts that no physical boundary needs to be \n\nspecified at the centre of the cylinder (which corresponds to a symmetry situation) and \n\nthat the external refrigeration system imposes a fixed temperature on the outer radius. \n\nPerpendicular to the cylinder\u2019s axis are two circular surfaces where heat fluxes occur, \n\nleading to a Z22 designation in the z direction if the temperature gradient across the \n\ncylinder thickness is to be considered. \n\nOf special interest is the fact that multidimensional GFs can be obtained from \n\nthe multiplication of one-dimensional GF in all cartesian cases and in some cases for \n\ncylindrical coordinates, namely if the problem involves only the (r, z, t) variables (i.e. if \n\nthe problem has azimuthal symmetry), as is the case in the problem under study: \n\n \n\n \n( )( )\n\n( ) ( ) ( )' ' ' '01 22 01 22, , | , , , | , , | ,\n\nRZ R Z\n\nR Z R Z\n\nG G G\n\nG r z t r z G r t r G z t z? ? ?\n\n= ?\n\n=\n\n  (2.15) \n\n \n\nwhere the one-dimensional GF will be GR01 and GZ22, respectively for the radial and z \n\ndirections. These are tabulated in several references [Carslaw and Jaeger 1959, \u00d6zisik \n\n1993, Cole et al. 2010] and can be written as: \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\n ( )\n( ) ( )\n\n( )\n\n'\n2 2 0 0( )'\n\n01 2 2\n1 1\n\n1\n, | ,\n\ni it a\ni\n\nR\ni i\n\nJ r a J r a\nG r t r e\n\na J\n\n? ??\n? ?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n=\n\n= ?

(2.17) \n\n \n\nwhere J0 and J1 are Bessel functions of the first kind and ?i are eigenvalues found from \n\nJ0(?i) = 0. \n\nBoth GF expressions above involve infinite series, raising numerical issues \n\nassociated with the solution of infinite series solutions, which can have slow \n\nconvergence that render obtaining accurate numerical values difficult and can lead to \n\nlengthy computer evaluation time due to the large number of terms to be evaluated. \n\nThe latter are an issue in heat conduction, especially if many temperature values (in \n\nspace or time) or high numerical accuracy are needed. \n\nEvery infinite series must be truncated to a finite number of terms when \n\nevaluated numerically on a computer. The number of terms determines the accuracy of \n\nthe numerical result but the number of terms required for accurate evaluation can vary \n\nwith time and location within the body and this non-uniform convergence makes \n\ndifficult a beforehand estimate of how many terms of the series are necessary. The use \n\nof a fixed number of terms, for example for the purpose of evaluating temperature \n\nvariations over time in several locations, risks poor accuracy in some locations and a \n\nwaste of computer time in others. Thus, a convergence criterion is needed to choose the \n\nnumber of terms, at any location and time, to provide a predetermined accuracy \n\nwithout wasting computer cycles. \n\nWhen the series contains an exponential factor the most usual convergence \n\ncriterion is to specify the maximum allowable absolute value of the time-exponential \n\nargument, which decreases monotonically and dominates the convergence behaviour in \n\nthe aforementioned series. Tracking the value of the argument is a conservative way of \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\ncontrolling convergence but is possible to apply ahead of time in order to specify the \n\nnumber of necessary series terms. The convergence criterion is to continue to add terms \n\nto the series until the argument of the exponential factor exceeds a maximum set value.  \n\nExpressions for both GR01 and GZ22 include time-exponential arguments in the \n\nform e-A where A is either ?2?(t - ?)/a2 or j2?2?(t - ?)/b2. Their presence multiplying by \n\nall other terms in each series causes rapid numerical convergence of the series for large \n\nFourier numbers (or dimensionless times) Fo = ?(t - ?)/a2 and ?(t - ?)/b2. The \n\nconvergence criterion can be used to determine the number of series terms needed for \n\naccurate evaluation of temperatures, terms being added until A > Kmax, where Kmax is \n\nthe maximum allowable absolute value of the exponential argument. This determines \n\nthe size of the exponential factor and controls the convergence speed.  \n\nConsider the example of GZ22, dimensionless times are usually considered large if \n\n?t/b2 > 0.025 for this type of GF [Cole et al. 2010]. The exponential term will be \n\nsmaller than 0.001 when the absolute value of the argument is greater than Kmax = 6.9, \n\ni.e.: \n\n \n\n \n2\n\nm\n2\n\n6.9\nt\n\nb\n\n??\n> .  (2.18) \n\n \n\nIn this case ?m = j?, so the above relation yields Nmax= 9 for Fo = 0.001, meaning that \n\nonly eight terms of the infinite series are necessary to make the exponential factor \n\nsmaller than 0.001. If ?t/b2 = 0.025 only five terms are necessary, and for \u201clarge\u201d \n\nvalues of ?t/b2 (such as 0.17 or larger) only the first term is necessary [Cole et al. \n\n2010]. \n\nIt should be noted that the GF method, as discussed above, yields analytical \n\nexpressions for temperatures over times and locations for a given set of initial \n\nconditions, sink terms and boundary conditions, that can be expressed in numerical \n\nterms if necessary values such as temperatures, coordinates or times are supplied. In \n\norder to perform the computations required by the Green\u2019s Function Solution Equation \n\n(GFSE), analytical forms of the initial temperature field, the sink term and the \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nboundary conditions in terms of time and spatial coordinates are necessary so that they \n\ncan be used as input in the GFSE for performing integrations.  \n\nWhile the GF formulation is potentially extremely useful, it does have some \n\nlimitations that must be kept in mind, namely when variable boundary conditions or \n\nsource/sink terms are to be considered. Such a situation would lead to the use of \n\nanalytical functions of time and spatial variables that would require updating as \n\nnecessary, since in the case under discussion the sink term will be constant neither in \n\ntime nor in location. Its magnitude is a function of the difference between local and \n\ntranspiration flow temperatures (even if the latter is assumed to be constant). This \n\nmeans that for arbitrarily short times solutions will probably be fairly accurate. \n\nNonetheless, their accuracy will diminish if the sink term is not updated. This difficulty \n\ncan be overcome by applying GFSE in an incremental approach, implementing an \n\niterative calculation procedure that can be described as follows: \n\n1. Adequate GFs are selected; \n\n2. A grid of points is defined for calculation purposes in spatial coordinates; \n\n3. Boundary conditions are specified; \n\n4. An initial temperature field is specified as an analytical function of space \n\ncoordinates and time t; \n\n5. The grid and the initial temperature field are used for computing an \n\ninitial sink term, based on the temperature difference between the solid \n\nand the transpiration airflow and features such as hole diameter and plate \n\nthickness. Once again an analytical function of space coordinates and time \n\nt is sought; \n\n6. A number of summation terms is specified; \n\n7. A timestep is selected; \n\n8. Temperatures as a function of initial temperature fields and sink terms are \n\ncomputed for t = timestep; \n\n9. Updated analytical temperature fields and sink term functions, or if \n\nnecessary/applicable boundary conditions, are obtained from calculated \n\npoint temperature and coordinates. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nThe process is repeated until either a maximum number of iterations (i.e. a \n\ntotal time) are performed or some other termination criterion is met, such as minimum \n\ntemperature variations between iterations, as shown in Figure 2.1. \n\nThis iterative process and updating of boundary and sink terms is not \n\nencountered in most literature references given the fact that those applications deal \n\nwith constant boundary and source/sink terms, the case of successive heating and \n\ncooling cycles being the only notable exception [Talati and Jalalifar 2009]. The \n\nreasonability of such an approach must therefore be carefully considered, especially \n\nwhen intrinsically iterative methods such as transient finite differences can be \n\nconsidered as alternatives, as discussed below. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Iterative GF calculation methodology. \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Finite Difference Formulation \n\nA typical finite difference formulation typically involves the approximation of \n\ndifferential increments in temperature and space coordinates, once an adequate element \n\ngrid of nodes has been defined.

Such problems can be \n\nset up using the resistance concept for describing heat transfer between nodes.  \n\n The thermal resistance concept is widely used and can be thought of as the \n\nratio between a driving potential and the corresponding heat transfer rate. The thermal \n\nresistance for conduction is usually given as: \n\n \n\n \nt,cond\n\nL\nR\n\nkA\n= ,  (2.19) \n\n \n\nwhere L is the spatial distance, A the area and k the thermal conductivity, while for \n\nconvection the following expression is used: \n\n \n\n \nt,conv\n\n1\nR\n\nhA\n= ,  (2.20) \n\n \n\nwhere h is the convection heat transfer coefficient. \n\n Radiation is a somewhat more complex matter. While the radiation heat flux \n\nfrom hot surroundings to a colder surface is usually written as: \n\n \n\n ( )4 4rad sur sq A T T??= ? ,  (2.21) \n \n\nwhere ? is the surface emissivity and ? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, it can also be \n\nexpressed as: \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n ( )rad sur srq h A T T= ? ,  (2.22) \n \n\nwith a radiation heat transfer coefficient in the form: \n\n \n\n ( )( )2 2r sur s sur sh T T T T?? ? ?= + +? ?? ? .  (2.23) \n \n\nHere the radiative transfer is modelled in a manner similar to convection in the sense \n\nthat it is linearized, making the heat exchange proportional to a temperature difference \n\nrather than to the difference between two temperatures to the fourth power. It should \n\nhowever be noted that hr strongly depends on temperature while the temperature \n\ndependence of the convection heat transfer coefficient h is generally weak. A thermal \n\nresistance for radiation can nevertheless be written as: \n\n \n\n \nt,rad\n\nr\n\n1\nR\n\nh A\n=   (2.24) \n\n \n\nDesignating a node of interest with the subscript i and adjoining nodes with \n\nsubscript j, the steady-state input to node i will be zero, that is: \n\n \n\n 0j i\ni\n\nj ij\n\nT T\nq\n\nR\n\n?\n+ =? ,  (2.25) \n\n \n\nwhere qi is the heat delivered to node i by heat generation, radiation, etc., while Rij can \n\ntake the form of convection boundaries, internal conduction, etc.  \n\nThe specification of volume element ?V and internal nodal resistances is \n\nstraightforward for cartesian coordinates, especially when the grid consists of equally-\n\nspaced increments ?x, ?y and ?z. For the case under consideration, with its \n\ncylindrical coordinate system, internal nodal resistances and volume element ?V can be \n\nsummarized as listed in Table 2.1: \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Internal nodal resistances and volume element for cylindrical \n\ncoordinates. \n\nNomenclature for increments r, m; ?, n; z, p \n\nVolume element ?V rm?r???z \n\nRm+  ( )m 2\nr\n\nk r r z?\n\n?\n\n+ ? ? ?\n  \n\nRm- ( )m 2\nr\n\nk r r z?\n\n?\n\n?? ? ?\n \n\nRn+ m\nr\n\nk r z\n\n??\n? ?\n\n \n\nRn- m\nr\n\nk r z\n\n??\n? ?\n\n \n\nRp+ \nm\n\nz\n\nkr r ?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n \n\nRp- \nm\n\nz\n\nkr r ?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n \n\n \n\nOnce steady-state problems are set up, a system of equations is constructed and \n\ncan be solved for nodal temperatures using matrix inversion techniques or, more \n\ntypically when the number of nodes becomes larger, Gauss-Seidel iterations applied by \n\nsolving for temperature Ti in terms of the resistances and temperatures of adjoining \n\nnodes Tj as: \n\n \n\n \n( )\n\n( )1\ni j ijj\n\ni\n\nijj\n\nq T R\nT\n\nR\n\n+\n=\n\n?\n?\n\n.  (2.26) \n\n \n\nThe procedure usually involves the specification of an initial set of values for Ti \n\nobtained by any adequate method, which are then used to recalculate nodal \n\ntemperatures. The process continues until temperature variations between iterations \n\nare arbitrarily small.  \n\nWhen the problem of interest is transient, the net energy transfer into the node \n\nmust be evidenced as an increase in internal energy of the node, which when expressed \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nin terms of specific heat and temperature leads to an approximation for its rate of \n\nchange in time from instant t to t+1 as: \n\n \n\n \n1\n\np\n\nt t\n\ni i\nT TE\n\nc V\nt t\n?\n\n+ ??\n= ?\n\n? ?\n  (2.27) \n\n \n\nwhere V?  is the volume element. Designating the thermal capacity as: \n\n \n\n \np\ni\n\ni i i\nC c V?= ?   (2.28) \n\n \n\nthe general resistance-capacity formulation for the energy balance on a node is \n\n \n\n \n1t t t t\n\nj i i i\ni i\n\nj ij\n\nT T T T\nq C\n\nR t\n\n+? ?\n+ =\n\n?\n? .  (2.29) \n\n \n\nSuch formulations can be developed on the basis of a forward-difference \n\ntechnique, in that the temperature of a node at a future time increment is expressed in \n\nterms of the surrounding nodal temperatures at the beginning of the time increment. In \n\nthis case the expressions are called explicit formulations because it is possible to write \n\nnodal temperatures explicitly in terms of the previous nodal temperatures. In this \n\nformulation, the calculation proceeds directly from one time increment to the next until \n\nthe temperature distribution is calculated at the desired final state. \n\nThe difference equation may also be formulated by computing the space \n\nderivatives in terms of the temperatures at the t+1 increment. Such an arrangement is \n\ncalled a backward-difference formulation because the time derivative moves backward \n\nfrom the times for heat conduction into the node. This backward-difference formulation \n\ndoes not permit the explicit calculation of Tt+1 in terms of Tt. Rather, a whole set of \n\nequations must be written for the entire nodal system and solved simultaneously to \n\ndetermine temperatures Tt+1, so the backward-difference method produces an implicit \n\nformulation for the future temperatures in the transient analysis. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nThe advantage of an explicit forward-difference procedure is the direct \n\ncalculation of future nodal temperatures. However, the stability of this calculation is \n\ngoverned by the selection of the values of space and time increments. On the one hand, \n\na selection of a small value of space increment automatically forces the selection of \n\nsome maximum value of time increment. On the other hand, no such restriction is \n\nimposed on the solution of the equations which are obtained from the implicit \n\nformulation. This means that larger time increments can be selected to speed up the \n\ncalculation. The obvious disadvantage of the implicit method is the larger number of \n\ncalculations for each time step. For problems involving a large number of nodes, \n\nhowever, the implicit method may result in less total computer time expended for the \n\nfinal solution because very small time increments may have to be imposed in the \n\nexplicit method from stability requirements. Much larger time increments can be \n\nemployed with the implicit method to speed the solution. \n\nThe time increment necessary to ensure stability is usually given as [Holman \n\n1986]: \n\n \n\n \n( )\n\nmin\n1\ni\n\nijj\n\nC\nt\n\nR\n\n? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ?\n? ?? ?? ?? ??\n\n  (2.30) \n\n \n\nwhile the following expression is useful for alleviating potential problems of round-off \n\nerrors in computer solutions when small thermal resistances are employed: \n\n \n\n 1\nt t\n\nj it t\n\ni i i\nji ij\n\nT Tt\nT q T\n\nC R\n+\n\n? ??? ? ?= + +? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n? .  (2.31) \n\n \n\nAs mentioned above, heat generation (or heat sinks, as needed in the present \n\ncase) and radiation phenomena can be accounted for with term qi, while convection \n\nboundaries are treated in the same way as internal conduction. Given the method\u2019s \n\niterative approach, it is always possible to update sink terms, convection and radiation \n\nbetween iterations, adjusting their magnitude with the nodal temperatures calculated in \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nall iterations. This is especially relevant concerning radiation, given its strongly non-\n\nlinear nature. \n\nRegarding the implementation of finite differences, the iterative calculation \n\nprocedure that can be described as follows: \n\n1. A grid of points is defined for calculation purposes in spatial coordinates; \n\n2. Nodal resistances, element volumes, sink terms and thermal capacities are \n\ncalculated; \n\n3. An initial temperature field is specified as nodal temperatures; \n\n4. The stability criterion is applied in order to determine the minimum time \n\nincrement; \n\n5. New nodal temperatures are computed for t = ?tmin; \n\n6. Updated sink terms and radiation resistances obtained if necessary; \n\n7. The process is repeated until either a maximum number of iterations (i.e. \n\na total time) are performed or some other termination criterion is met, \n\nsuch as minimum temperature variations between iterations. \n\nThis process can be summarized as illustrated in Figure 2.2. \n\nWhen the transpiration airflow is reset at its initial mass flow, the transient \n\ntemperature curve will decrease back towards its initial value dictated by the incident \n\nradiative flux but especially by the transpiration airflow, at a rate (i.e. slope) that will \n\nbe a function of the magnitude of both factors and that can also be quantified. \n\n2.3 Assumptions and Simplifications \n\nA proper methodology needed to be established in order to implement both the GF \n\nmethod and the finite difference approach. Despite the fact that the GF library lists a \n\nnumber of readily available analytical formulations, these must nevertheless be \n\nadequately used by setting up a solution to the conduction problem under study, and \n\nall necessary operations must be performed in order to obtain temperature values for all \n\nlocations and times of interest. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Iterative finite difference calculation methodology. \n\n \n\nIn order to use both the GF method and finite differences as a basis for the \n\nstudy and development of a heat flux meter, it was felt necessary to gain more precise \n\ninsight into their results in an incremental fashion. This was done by comparing results \n\nof both approaches with those obtained with equivalent CFD simulations of the same \n\nphysical problem, including heat sink terms, radiation and convection. \n\nAt this point the question of whether a one-dimensional approach was adequate \n\nin describing the problem needed to be addressed, in order to proceed with parametric \n\nstudies. As mentioned earlier an assumption of azimuthal symmetry is reasonable for \n\nthe case under discussion, given its geometry and boundary conditions. Thus, a fully \n\nthree-dimensional approach would be unnecessary, but more importantly the sensing \n\nelement\u2019s small thickness (much smaller than its diameter) could render conduction \n\none-dimensional in radial direction and lead to a much simpler approach by ignoring \n\ntemperature gradients along the element\u2019s thickness. \n\nThis was exactly the basis for the analytical model developed for Gardon gauges \n\n[Gardon 1953]. Their sensing elements typically have thicknesses ranging from as low as \n\n0.05 to 0.2 mm (hence the frequently used designation of \u201cthin foil\u201d).

Other applications of \n\nmicroperforated steel plates were found (including, oddly enough, espresso machine \n\nfilters) with thicknesses around the same value that exhibited satisfactory mechanical \n\nresistance.  \n\nAs discussed below in Chapter 3, common manufacturing processes such as \n\nphotoetching place a limitation on the range of hole diameter to plate thickness ratio, \n\nrendering impractical holes with diameters smaller than the plate thickness. For the \n\nintended range of sensing element diameters (around 10 mm), hundreds of 0.1 mm \n\nholes can nevertheless be fitted in order to preserve the transpiration principle, and the \n\nquestion of whether a one-dimensional approximation to the behaviour of the sensing \n\nelement can be settled by examining the plate\u2019s Biot number. Biot numbers are usually \n\ncalculated as: \n\n \n\n cBi\nhL\n\nk\n=   (2.32) \n\n \n\nwhere h is the convection heat transfer coefficient, k is the thermal conductivity and Lc \n\nis a characteristic length that is often indicated as a solid\u2019s volume to surface area ratio \n\nbut can also be, for simple geometries, a radius or a thickness. For lumped analysis \n\nvalidity purposes the criterion is usually to regard it as valid when Bi &lt;0.1. \n\nWhile thermal conductivity is at most dependent on temperature, the \n\nconvection heat transfer coefficient is strongly dependent on the airflow velocity on the \n\nsurface. In order to roughly evaluate which Biot numbers are to be expected, thermal \n\nconductivity is assumed to be on the lower side of the range of values for stainless steel \n\n(typically ranging between 13 and 19 WK-1m-1), while for simplicity in a rough \n\napproach convection coefficients can be assumed to be those of air in forced convection \n\nfound in standard textbook tables (up to 200 WK-1m-2), although as discussed in detail \n\nbelow the determination of convection coefficients is a much more complicated matter \n\nand will be performed with adequate care later on. Suffice to say for the moment that \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nactual convection coefficients for the application under discussion will be typically \n\nhigher than those used for these Biot number calculations. \n\nIf a Biot number is calculated based on plate thickness (0.1 mm) and radius \n\n(4.75 mm, as will be explained in Chapter 3) as characteristic lengths, Biot numbers \n\nwould be Bi = 0.0015 and Bi = 0.076 respectively. An Lc characteristic length can more \n\nproperly be defined and used to calculate a solid\u2019s volume to surface area ratio. If a 9.5 \n\nmm total diameter, 0.1 mm hole diameters and 0.1 mm plate thickness are used, the \n\nfollowing Biot numbers are obtained as a function of the number of holes: \n\nTable 2.2 \u2013 Plate Biot number as a function of the number of holes. \n\nNumber of Holes 250 500 750 1000 \n\nBiot Number 0.00071 0.00067 0.00064 0.00061 \n\n \n\nThese are hardly surprising considering the plate\u2019s very low thickness and can \n\narguably be even lower if effects that have to do with convection enhancing phenomena \n\nare considered, as will be discussed in further detail below. \n\nAll Biot numbers in Table 2.2 are below the conventional Bi &lt;0.1 limit where \n\nlumped analysis is deemed reasonable but values for the radial direction are without \n\nsurprise larger than those for thickness, where the very low Biot number values \n\nindicate negligible temperature gradients, make a one-dimensional approximation \n\nreasonable and greatly simplify obtaining accurate models for describing the sensing \n\nelement\u2019s behaviour and testing and verifying results for both approaches. \n\nThe selection of an adequate value for the convection coefficient is of the utmost \n\nimportance while being somewhat more complicated than apparent at first sight and \n\ncertainly not as simple as used values tabulated in textbooks. \n\nStandard heat transfer references often list relationships meant to be used for \n\ndeveloping or fully developed flows. If heating is occurring at the surface of a tube \n\nthrough which a fluid is flowing, Nusselt numbers and heat transfer coefficients are \n\nhighest at the inlet, where boundary layer thicknesses are smallest, and decrease \n\ngradually towards fully developed values. These effects are usually described by \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\ndefining an entry length, defined as the distance from the entrance where relevant \n\nvariables reach within 2% of their fully developed values. Laminar flows show strong \n\ndependency on the Reynolds number and lead to entry length values as high as 115 \n\ntimes the diameter, while turbulent flows entry lengths\u2019 are much shorter and less \n\ndependent on Reynolds numbers. However, in many flows of practical interest entrance \n\neffects only become insignificant beyond lengths higher than 10 diameters. \n\nFurthermore, Nusselt numbers for uniform surface temperatures and uniform heat flux \n\nconditions are nearly identical in the entrance regions [\u00c7engel 2006].  \n\nGiven the plate\u2019s very low thickness, the lateral areas of individual holes are \n\nvery low, so that the relationships for entry regions have a limited applicability even if \n\nseveral hundreds of holes are to be considered. These small lateral areas also raise the \n\nquestion of determining the precise nature of the convection interaction of the \n\ntranspiration airflow with the perforated plate. Since the transpiration airflow is \n\nexpected to be colder than the surroundings and the plate, heat will be removed by \n\nconvection not only in the microperforated pattern but also (and potentially mostly) on \n\nthe windward face of the perforated plate, on which the incoming transpiration airflow \n\nimpinges. The magnitude of this heat transfer will be a function of the surface areas \n\nand the local temperature difference between the air and each surface, besides the local \n\nconvective heat transfer coefficient that can be influenced by geometry and flow \n\nconditions.  \n\nWhile single hole relationships are useful and important in understanding the \n\nnature of the convective interaction between the airflow impinging on a perforated \n\nsurface and the holes themselves [Sparrow and Gurdal 1981, Cho et al. 1997], other \n\nparameters have greater importance as far as perforated patterns are concerned. The \n\nmatter of considering a repetitive pattern is nevertheless fundamental since this regular \n\ngeometry gives rise to a symmetry pattern whereby each hole is surrounded by a region \n\nwhere symmetry surfaces exist as its boundaries. Within each such unit cell, the heat \n\ntransfer and fluid flow characteristics are identical to those of all the other cells that \n\nblanket the surface, so that measurements for a single cell yield information for the \n\nentire surface [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982], as can be seen from the illustration in Figure \n\n2.3. \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Fluid flow passing from the upstream surface into the perforated pattern [Sparrow \n\nand Ortiz 1982]. \n\n \n\nAlthough it was found that the influence of the hole length-to-diameter ratio \n\nhas significance, it was shown that the appropriate heat transfer area for the \n\ndetermination of the heat-transfer coefficient is essentially that of the hole-approach \n\nflow [Andrews et al. 1991]. Various studies showed that correlations for Nusselt and \n\nReynolds numbers using a convection coefficient based solely on the hole internal \n\nsurface area did not adequately correlate the experimental results, indicating that \n\ninternal hole heat transfer was not the dominant physical process. The use of the hole \n\napproach surface area to define convective heat transfer coefficient resulted in a good \n\ncorrelation of the results, indicating that the hole approach convective heat transfer \n\nwas the dominant heat transfer process [Andrews et al. 1988]. \n\nThe importance of the hole spacing-to-diameter ratio is therefore fundamental in \n\nthe determination of heat transfer coefficients since it influences the acceleration of the \n\nairflow when transitioning from its incoming bulk velocity to the faster flowing airflow \n\ntowards and inside the holes. Correlations for a variety of situations and geometries \n\nhave been developed, typically relying on experimental results and considering a large \n\nvariety of Reynolds numbers, up to 20,000 [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982, Dorignac et al. \n\n2005, Fenot et al. 2005].  \n\nAs discussed in further detail in Chapter 3, a 2.5 spacing-to-diameter ratio was \n\neventually selected due to boundary layer control and radiation transmissivity \n\nconsiderations. This led to a perforated pattern with 0.1 mm holes with a 0.25 mm \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\nspacing, and interestingly some of the correlations mentioned above are available for \n\nthe exact 2.5 spacing-to-diameter ratios of interest in the present work [Sparrow and \n\nOrtiz 1982], although this was actually only realised after the dimensioning procedures \n\ndiscussed in Chapter 3 were carried out and components had been manufactured \n\naccording to those specifications.   \n\nWhile these correlations were admittedly obtained with somewhat larger holes \n\nthan those under discussion (with diameters ranging from 1 to 10 mm), the fact that \n\nthe diameters to be considered here are smaller is not expected to significantly \n\ninvalidate such relationships since recent experimental results show that airflow \n\ncharacteristics in microtubes (i.e. for somewhat lower diameters than those considered \n\nhere), namely heat transfer correlations for laminar and turbulent flows, are the same \n\nas for larger tubes if the higher velocities related to smaller diameter and possible \n\ncompressibility phenomena are duly taken into account [Yang et al. 2012]. \n\nThe aforementioned correlations propose Nusselt numbers based on different \n\nassumptions regarding characteristic lengths. An earlier study proposes that the Nusselt \n\nnumber can be determined as [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982]: \n\n \n\n \n1 30.486Nu 0.881Re Pr=   (2.33) \n\n \n\nwith Pr being the Prandtl number (which for air is approximately 0.7) and defining the \n\nReynolds number Re as a function of density ?, air velocity v, hole diameter d and \n\ndynamic viscosity \u00b5: \n\n \n\n Re\nvd?\n\n\u00b5\n=   (2.34) \n\n \n\nand writing the Nusselt number as: \n\n \n\n Nu\nhA\n\nek\n=   (2.35) \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\nwhere h is the convection coefficient, k is the thermal conductivity of air, A is the area \n\nof the surface that participates in the heat transfer process (i.e. the unit cell area minus \n\nthat of the holes) and e is the hole spacing. This means that this Nusselt number is \n\nbased on a characteristic length that is the ratio of geometric features rather than an \n\nindividual constant of the pattern, and that different characteristic lengths are used in \n\nthe Reynolds and Nusselt numbers. \n\n Other studies extended the work presented in the earlier reference mainly by \n\nusing a larger variety of spacing-to-diameter ratios (from 1.7 up to 9.6), using an \n\nalternative formulation for the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers based on the same \n\ncharacteristic length A/e and expressing the Nusselt number as a function of the \n\nReynolds number and unit cell parameters, yielding in each hole: \n\n \n\n \nh\n\nRe\nvd\n\ne\n\n?\n\n\u00b5\n=   (2.36) \n\n \n\nand \n\n \n\n \n1.979 0.163\n\n0.409\nh\n\nNu 1.202 Re\ne e\n\ndA\n\n? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?= ? ?? ?? ? ?? ?? ? ?? ?\n,  (2.37) \n\n \n\nwith results within 10% of all experimental measurements [Dorignac et al. 2005]. The \n\nearlier formulation was used mainly for compactness. \n\nThese formulations allow the calculation of a convection heat transfer coefficient \n\nto be used both in a volumetric heat sink term and in the convective boundary \n\nencountered on the windward side of the plate, in terms of an incoming air mass flow. \n\nThis in turn enables the study of the effect of varying mass flows passing through the \n\nperforated pattern, of which the convection coefficient will be a function. \n\nIt is therefore necessary to obtain a relationship between the incoming \n\ntranspiration mass flows, which can be characterized in terms of their pressures, \n\ndensities, temperatures and velocities, and the velocities in the holes and resulting \n\nReynolds and Nusselt numbers and therefore convection coefficients. All this for any \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\ngiven perforated pattern, especially as far as its hole diameter-to-spacing ratio is \n\nconcerned since it dictates heat transfer areas. \n\nAt this point it is a reasonable to assume that all the incoming compressed air \n\npasses through the holes in the perforated pattern, although in practice some leakage is \n\nexpected at the fringe of the plate if some less than perfect welding is present. \n\nNevertheless, this assumed mass continuity can be expressed as: \n\n \n\n \n1 2\n\nm m=? ? ,  (2.38) \n\n \n\nwhere \n1\n\nm?  is the mass flow in the compressed air feed tube and \n2\n\nm?  is the sum of mass \n\nflows in the N holes of the pattern, i.e.: \n\n \n\n \n2 2\n\n1 2\n1 1 2 24 4\n\nd d\nv N v\n? ?\n\n? ?=   (2.39) \n\n \n\nwhere ?, v and d are densities, velocities and diameters, respectively. This equation can \n\nbe simplified and rearranged by multiplying and dividing each side of the equation by \n\nthe relevant dynamic viscosity, obtaining the following relationship where Reynolds \n\nnumbers are made to appear: \n\n \n\n \n1 1 1 2 2 2\n\nRe Red N d\u00b5 \u00b5= .  (2.40) \n\n \n\nGiven the fact that the plate is a rather poor heat exchanger due to its low \n\nthickness and relatively low surface area, and that relatively high mass flows are to be \n\nused in order to ensure boundary layer blow-off, the bulk of the transpiration airflow is \n\nnot expected to heat up significantly, even when considering a temperature increase \n\ndue to compression in the holes. This means that viscosity variations due to \n\ntemperature differences are assumed to not be significant and allow writing the \n\nReynolds number in the holes as: \n\n \n\n 1 1\nh 2\n\n2\n\nRe\nRe Re\n\nd\n\nNd\n= = .  (2.41) \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nOnce Reynolds numbers for the holes are known, the Nusselt number \n\ncorrelations above can be used to compute various convection coefficients, as intended. \n\nA certain incoming mass flow is a function of the tube area, the airflow velocity and its \n\npressure, and it is always possible to obtain a desired mass flow by any combination of \n\nsuch parameters. In practice, constraints are usually posed in terms of a fixed feed line \n\ndiameter (and therefore flow area) and a compressed air supply pressure. Operational \n\nparameters are described in detail in Chapter 3, when the dimensioning of the \n\nperforated plate and the setting of operation conditions are discussed. Within the \n\nframework of developing an adequate formulation for the sensing element such detail is \n\nunnecessary and some parameters were fixed, namely the compressed airflow cross \n\nsection and the supply pressure. \n\nGiven the plate\u2019s very low thickness, the question of whether to consider the \n\nlateral area of the holes in the perforated pattern for convective heat transfer purposes \n\ncould be thought of as secondary, but that assumption does require some careful \n\nconsideration. The plate\u2019s effective frontal area can be calculated as the difference \n\nbetween its actual frontal area and the area of each hole multiplied by the number of \n\nholes, while the total hole lateral area is the perimeter of each hole multiplied by the \n\nnumber of holes and the plate thickness. If a plate diameter of 9.5 mm and a 0.1 mm \n\nhole diameter equal to the plate thickness, the area ratio can be calculated as shown in \n\nTable 2.3. \n\nTable 2.3 \u2013 Plate areas as a function of the number of holes. \n\nNumber of holes 250 500 750 1000 \n\nEffective frontal area [m2] 6.89\u00d710-5 6.70\u00d710-5 6.50\u00d710-5 6.30\u00d710-5 \n\nHole lateral area [m2] 7.85\u00d710-6 1.57\u00d710-5 2.36\u00d710-5 3.14\u00d710-5 \n\nArea ratio 8.77 4.26 2.76 2.00 \n\nTotal area [m2] 7.68\u00d710-5 8.27\u00d710-5 8.86\u00d710-5 9.44\u00d710-5 \n\n \n\nWhile the frontal area of the plate is obviously higher than the sum of the \n\nlateral areas of the holes, the contribution of the latter naturally rises as their number \n\nincreases. When the number of holes is in the order of a thousand, as will happen in \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nthe prototype, the frontal area of the plate is still double that of the holes, but it was \n\nfelt necessary to take the hole area into account by adding it to the frontal area when \n\nused in the aforementioned relationships for the determination of the convective \n\ncoefficient. \n\nAs the diameter of the compressed air supply, the same value as earlier was \n\nused, i.e. 9.5 mm, while a supply pressure of 5 bar was specified since it is the standard \n\nsupply pressure at the laboratory where the experimental work was to be conducted, \n\nand a supply temperature of 25\u00baC was also assumed. Likewise, using the \n\naforementioned assumption that the bulk of the airflow will not heat up significantly in \n\ncontact with the plate, Prandtl numbers and air thermal conductivities were taken to \n\nbe those at 25\u00baC. \n\nConvective heat transfer coefficients could thus be calculated as a function of \n\nincoming air mass flows, representing the actual physical situation to be encountered \n\nby the prototype when in operation. It should be noted that the aforementioned \n\ncorrelations for Nusselt numbers use the full area of the unit cell rather than a value \n\nthat subtracts the frontal area of the holes. However, this correction was considered \n\nrelevant when using the correlation, so that the total area values in Table 2.3 were \n\nused in the calculations. The fact that the correlations were obtained for a range of \n\nspacing-to-diameter ratios (2.0 and 2.5 for the version used) means that for a given \n\nplate frontal area a large number of holes is necessary to fulfil the ratio requirement, \n\nmeaning that the areas for small numbers of holes were not used because they would \n\npotentially translate a situation outside the bounds of the correlations\u2019 validity. \n\nFurthermore, as discussed in Chapter 3, a low number of holes in the pattern would \n\nlead to poor flow uniformity and low transmissivity that could have detrimental effects \n\non the sensing element\u2019s intended performance. Values for 1000 holes are for the \n\nmoment sufficiently representative for model development purposes. \n\nIllustrated in Figure 2.4 is the Nusselt number as a function of the Reynolds \n\nnumber, using both of the aforementioned relationships, i.e. the earlier one embodied in \n\nthe upper curve of black circles [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982] compared to values resulting \n\nfrom the application of the latter work [Dorignac et al. 2005], for hole diameter between \n\n1 and 15 mm and hole spacing/diameter ratios ranging from 1.7 to 9.6.  \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nThe plot in Figure 2.5 illustrates the same numbers calculated using the values \n\nand assumptions discussed above. The graphic in Figure 2.6 illustrates the relationship \n\nbetween incoming mass airflow and the convection heat transfer coefficient on the \n\nplate, where as expected the power function adjusted from calculated values, i.e.: \n\n \n\n 0.48645654h m= ? .  (2.42) \n\n \n\nThe same 0.486 exponent as in Equation 2.33 is displayed. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Reynolds vs. Nusselt number relationships [Dorignac, Vullierme et al. 2005]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Calculated Reynolds and Nusselt number relationship. \n \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n0.0E+00 1.0E+04 2.0E+04 3.0E+04 4.0E+04 5.0E+04 6.0E+04 7.0E+04\n\nN\nu\n\nRe\n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Convection heat transfer coefficient as a function of transpiration mass flow. \n\n \n\nAlthough different criteria where used in the definition of which particular area \n\nshould be used, Nusselt numbers are approximately the same for the same Reynolds \n\nnumbers, although the calculated values lie mostly outside the range of Reynolds \n\nnumbers shown from the references. This is not necessarily surprising given the fact \n\nthat somewhat a smaller perforated pattern is considered here, so that the Reynolds \n\nnumber will be higher for similar total mass flows. \n\nWithin the framework under discussion and for the same reason encountered in \n\nthe field of mechanics of materials, a 60\u00ba staggered pattern (also known as an \n\nhexagonal pattern given the fact that any node is surrounded by six others in an \n\nhexagonal arrangement) was used in preference to a square pattern since it guarantees \n\nan isotropic distribution in the plane of the plate, while for instance a square pattern \n\nwould lead to an orthotropic behaviour [Dowling 1999]. While the earlier of the \n\nreferences cited when calculating convection coefficients relied on the 60\u00ba staggered \n\npattern [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982], the other also studied the square pattern [Dorignac \n\net al. 2005]. Illustrated in Figure 2.7 is the hexagonal pattern of unit cells considered in \n\nthe earlier study, showing the unit cell\u2019s pitch (the same as spacing e considered in the \n\npresent work) and diameter. \n\ny = 45654x0.486\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1\n\nC\no\nn\nv\ne\nct\nio\nn\n c\no\ne\nff\nic\nie\nn\nt \n[W\n\nm\n-2\nK\n\n-1\n]\n\nTranspiration airflow [kgs-1] \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nThe same pattern was used in the remainder of the work described here but in a \n\ndifferent fashion for plate transmissivity calculations. The pattern can also be thought \n\nof as an equilateral triangle with a hole at each vertex, and area calculations using \n\ntriangular elements are slightly more simple than for hexagons, while the holes merely \n\ndictate a need to divide their perimeter, each hole having only one sixth of its \n\nperimeter and area within a particular cell, the same as saying that a single hole in the \n\npattern belongs to six different units. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Hexagonal unit cell pattern [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982]. \n\n \n\nSuch considerations are relevant in terms of finite differences in order to \n\ncompute element surface areas sink terms for heat transfer. The thermal resistance \n\nformulations in Equations 2.29 to 2.34 require element areas for conductive, convective \n\nand radiative heat transfer, and plate thickness L, hole diameters d and their spacing e \n\ndictate unit cell volumes and heat transfer areas, as summarized in Table 2.4. \n\nRegarding the specification of element areas in the resistance formulations, it is \n\nproposed to consider the upper surface of the element for radiative heat transfer, while \n\nfor convective transfer, given the plate\u2019s very low thickness, the area to be considered \n\nwill be that of the lower surface of the element plus the lateral area of the holes. This \n\neffectively means that the volumetric heat sink term is converted into a superficial \n\nresistance term that no longer needs to be taken into account in term qi of Equations \n\n2.35, 2.36, 2.39 and 2.41. This only occurs for this very particular situation where a \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nthin plate is being considered and a convection coefficient was determined for the whole \n\nof the perforated pattern. \n\nTable 2.4 \u2013 Unit Cell Parameters. \n\nUnit Cell \n\n \n\nElement Frontal Area \n2\n\nsin(60)\n2\ne\n\n  \n\nUnit Cell Volume \n2\n\nsin(60)\n2\ne\n\nL   \n\nEffective Frontal Heat Transfer Area \n2 2\n\nsin(60)\n2 8\ne d?\n\n?   \n\nEffective Volume \n2 2\n\nsin(60)\n2 8\ne d\n\nL\n?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?\n\n  \n\nHole Lateral Heat Transfer Area \n2\nd\n\nL?   \n\nOverall Convective Transfer Area \n2 2\n\nsin(60)\n2 8 2\ne d d\n\nL\n?\n\n?? +   \n\n \n\nIf the assumption of the same convection coefficient for the windward face of \n\nthe elements and for the interior of the holes was not considered reasonable, as could be \n\nthe case for a much thicker plate, a volumetric sink term (in Wm-3) could nevertheless \n\nbe readily calculated from a properly calculated convection coefficient by specifying an \n\ninterfacial area density Dsink (in m\n-1) for each particular unit cell, as the ratio between \n\nthe area for convective heat transfer within the holes in that cell (m2) and the unit cell \n\nvolume (m3). This density parameter would be constant for each particular unit cell \n\nand the same throughout the total volume of the component, unless specified otherwise. \n\nOnce a thickness and the unit cell parameters were selected, the interfacial area density \n\ncould be defined and allow the calculation of the area over which the convective heat \n\nsink would take effect using relationship: \n\n \n\n \nsink sink\n\nA D V= ?   (2.43) \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nwhere ?V is the element volume. The volumetric convective heat sink can be defined \n\nusing Newton\u2019s law of cooling in the form: \n\n \n\n ( )sink node air sinkg h T T D? = ?   (2.44) \n \n\nwhere is h is the convection coefficient for the airflow through the holes, Tnode is the \n\nnodal temperature and Tair is the temperature of the airflow. \n\nIt should be kept in mind that the sink term above merely describes the amount \n\nof heat that is removed from the plate by convection due to the temperature difference \n\nbetween the transpiration airflow and the perforated pattern, but that the magnitude \n\nof the temperatures in the plate is ultimately dictated not only by convection but also \n\nby the radiative interaction between the sensing element\u2019s surface and its hot \n\nsurroundings, via the radiative source\u2019s area and emissivity and the element\u2019s own \n\nreflectivity, emissivity and transmissivity. \n\nRather than introducing the relevant element areas explicitly in the resistance \n\nformulations using the cumbersome relationships listed in Table 2.5, these can be used \n\nto specify element area and volume correction factors to the frontal area A. This is \n\ndone both for the element radiative heat transfer areas in the form: \n\n \n\n \ncorr rad\n\nA A? = ,  (2.45) \n\n \n\nwhere A the element frontal area. Likewise, a correction factor can be defined for the \n\nconvective exchange in the form: \n\n \n\n \ncorr conv\n\nA A? = ,  (2.46) \n\n \n\nwhile a corrected volume for element heat capacity correction can also be defined as: \n\n \n\n \ncorr corr\n\nV V? ? = ? ,  (2.47) \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nwhere ?V is the element volume. This value is expected to be the same as for the \n\nradiative heat transfer area correction factor given the fact that the corrected volume is \n\nmerely the effective (i.e. corrected) area multiplied by the plate thickness. \n\nOnce the unit cell parameters are set, the correction factors can be determined \n\nfrom the relationships in Table 2.4. Using the aforementioned values of 0.1 mm for the \n\nhole diameter and plate thickness and of 0.25 mm for the hole spacing, the correction \n\nfactors become: \n\n \n\n rad\ncorr\n\n0.8549\nA\n\nA\n? = =   (2.48) \n\n  \n\n conv\ncorr\n\n1.4353\nA\n\nA\n? = =   (2.49) \n\n  \n\n rad\ncorr\n\n0.8549\nV\n\nV\n?\n\n?\n= =\n\n?\n  (2.50) \n\n \n\nAs expected the correction factors for the radiation area and the volume are the \n\nsame and take into account the diminution in frontal area and volume due to the holes, \n\nyielding values lower than unity, while the correction factor for convection is higher \n\nbecause of the sum of the lateral area of the holes to the effective frontal area, as was \n\npreviously discussed and is shown in Table 2.4. \n\nIt should be noted that this definition of a radiative transfer area where a \n\ndifference between blockage and opening areas is implied is essentially the same as \n\ntaking into account a transmissivity term, which means that the application of this \n\nradiative area correction factor inherently takes into account this radiative property of \n\nthe element that is extended to the total area of the plate. \n\nThe discussion above is furthermore useful in another situation, which has to do \n\nwith the boundary layer blow-off phenomenon. If the transpiration mass flows are \n\ninsufficient to eliminate the boundary layer on the side of the plate exposed to the high \n\ntemperature surroundings, some convection heat transfer will take place and the same \n\narea considered for radiative heat exchange must be considered for this convective \n\ntransfer, effectively introducing another resistance at each computational node. This \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\neffect was duly taken into account when comparing situations where relatively low \n\ntranspiration mass flows were used. \n\n2.4 Implementation and Results \n\nCalculations with the GF and finite differences methods were implemented using \n\nWolfram Mathematica 8, while CFD simulations were performed using ANSYS, namely \n\nits CFX module. \n\nThe purpose of such comparisons warrants some further discussion as far as \n\ntheir motivation is concerned. It could be argued that the commercial CFD software \n\ncould be used with confidence given its established reputation in a wide range of \n\napplications and previous experience, even as far as the author and supervisor of the \n\npresent document are concerned, and that the complexities related to the development \n\nof the aforementioned analytical and numerical approaches would thus be rendered \n\nunnecessary. Operational prototypes could thus be designed and built, their \n\nperformance and output being subsequently compared with the CFD model and its \n\nresults, without bothering with complex analytical formulations. \n\nThe use of the CFD software was always intended for design purposes, not only \n\nregarding the sensing element itself but especially when considering the overall \n\ninstrument as a system consisting of various components, rather than merely as a \n\nsensing element. \n\nThis does not mean that proper analytical and numerical methodologies would \n\nnot be useful, going beyond a mere unwillingness to use a commercial tool without a \n\nmore detailed theoretical understanding of the underlying phenomena. \n\nWhile undoubtedly more detailed in terms of the range of phenomena and \n\nmodels than can be implemented and studied, CFD software does require the \n\nspecification of particular geometric features of the systems to be studied, as for \n\ninstance the diameter and pitch of a particular perforated plate. This is typically done \n\neither directly in a CAD module of the CFD package or by importing the necessary \n\nfiles from dedicated CAD software, after which the finite element mesh is created for \n\ncomputation purposes. \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nParametric studies of geometry changes can thus be rendered somewhat \n\ncumbersome in terms of methodology due to this need for creating new geometry files. \n\nFurthermore, precisely because CFD software typically implements a variety of \n\nphysical models in great detail, simulations can take significant amounts of time to run. \n\n The methodologies proposed and discussed above can potentially reduce the \n\ncomputational effort involved, at least for the type of geometry of interest, since \n\nparametric tests regarding various perforation parameters can be conducted merely by \n\nadjusting the unit cell parameters listed in Table 2.4, while various operational \n\nconditions can be simulated by specifying relevant temperatures in the boundary \n\nconditions and airflows or calculating convection coefficients using the correlation of \n\nEquation 2.42, rather than creating new CAD geometries to be imported and meshed \n\ninto the CFD software. Relevant information about the behaviour of the sensing \n\nelement such as temperature spatial distributions, transient variations or time \n\nconstants ?, can thus be obtained at a fraction of the computational effort. \n\nThe choice for Mathematica came naturally since it is the foremost \n\ncomputational software program used in scientific and engineering technical computing, \n\nincluding relevant features such as mathematical function libraries (such as the Bessel \n\nfunctions and their zeros for GR01 calculation), support for symbolic computation and \n\nnumeric and symbolic tools for calculus, two- and three-dimensional data and function \n\nvisualization tools, solvers for various differential equation types and a programming \n\nlanguage supporting procedural, functional and object oriented constructs. \n\nOn the other hand, the choice for ANSYS  is equally self-evident, given its pre-\n\neminence as a numerical simulation and analysis tool, namely in terms of CFD and \n\nespecially now that CFX and Fluent are both available within a common package. All \n\nrelevant phenomena within the framework of the present discussion, such as fluid flow, \n\nheat sink terms, convection and radiation heat transfer between hot gases and solid \n\nsurfaces or conduction heat transfer within a solid, could thus be studied. \n\nBesides the conduction equations within the solids and the fundamental single-\n\nphase fluid flow Navier-Stokes equations employed in standard computational fluid \n\ndynamics software, the other models implemented in CFX are radiation and turbulence \n\nmodels. \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nGiven the low optical thickness of the envisaged application, the selected \n\nradiation simulation technique was the Discrete Transfer model [Shah 1979]. This \n\nmodel is based on tracing the domain by multiple rays leaving from the bounding \n\nsurfaces and depends upon the discretization of the equation of transfer along rays. The \n\npath along a ray is discretized by using the sections formed from breaking the path at \n\nelement boundaries and the physical quantities in each element are assumed to be \n\nuniform. These rays have to be traced through the domain in the same way that the \n\nphotons would be tracked in the Monte Carlo model, rendering the model description \n\nfor both Monte Carlo and Discrete Transfer models more or less identical. For the \n\nresults to be accurate the elements must be chosen so that the radiation field is \n\nreasonably homogeneous inside them. This means, for example, that they must be small \n\nenough that the scattering optical depth is less than unity across each element. The \n\nDiscrete Transfer model was found to be more computationally efficient than the \n\nMonte Carlo technique and was thus used. \n\nRegarding turbulence, one of the most prominent turbulence models, the k-? (k-\n\nepsilon) model, has been implemented in most general purpose CFD codes and is \n\nconsidered to be the industry standard model. It uses Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes \n\nequations and has proven to be stable and numerically robust and has a well \n\nestablished regime of predictive capability. For general purpose simulations, the k-? \n\nmodel offers a good compromise in terms of accuracy and robustness. \n\nWithin CFX, the k-? turbulence model uses the scalable wall-function approach \n\nto improve robustness and accuracy when the near-wall mesh is very fine. The scalable \n\nwall functions allow solution on arbitrarily fine near wall grids, which is a significant \n\nimprovement over standard wall functions. \n\nThe wall function method uses empirical formulas that impose suitable \n\nconditions near to the wall without resolving the boundary layer, thus saving \n\ncomputational resources. All turbulence models in CFX are suitable for a wall function \n\nmethod. Scalable wall functions overcome one of the major drawbacks of the standard \n\nwall function approach in that they can be applied on arbitrarily fine meshes. If the \n\nboundary layer is not fully resolved, the logarithmic wall function approximation to \n\nmodel the boundary layer is relied upon without affecting the validity of the scalable \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\nwall function approach. If the details of the boundary layer are not sought then it may \n\nnot be worth fully resolving it. \n\nAll simulations and calculations were carried out on a computer equipped with \n\nan Intel Core i7 processor at 2.93 GHz clock frequency and 4 MB of RAM, on a \n\nWindows 7 64-bit operating system. \n\nOnce possible approaches to the problem at hand are identified and reasonable \n\nassumptions and simplifications are made, the various options can be put to the test \n\nthrough an incrementally more detailed procedure. \n\nThe analysis of the various possible Biot numbers indicates that a radial one-\n\ndimensional approach is reasonable given the plate\u2019s low thermal gradients along its \n\nthickness, greatly simplifying the formulation of the problem both for Green\u2019s functions \n\nand finite differences. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, a comparison of results with equivalent CFD simulations \n\nwas always intended as means of validating their accuracy. Implied is also the \n\ncomparison between both of the approaches discussed before, if only to rule out the use \n\nof one in detriment of the other if large discrepancies are verified or if significant \n\ndifferences in computational effort become apparent. \n\nA one-dimensional finite differences approach to the problem takes the form of a \n\nradial problem where a single element is considered along the plate thickness (i.e. the z \n\ndirection) and with the same height as the plate itself. The one-dimensional, radial \n\nnature of the problem leads to thinking of the elements as a succession of annular \n\nregions and setting ?? = 2?, which leads to an isotropic behaviour as far as the \n\nangular coordinate is concerned, the question of how many elements to consider in the \n\nradial direction remaining.  \n\nConvective and radiative boundaries are treated as thermal resistances, with the \n\ntemperature imposed by an external refrigeration system specified on the outermost \n\nnode. Generation/sink terms are considered into the qi term of the finite difference \n\nformulation but, as discussed earlier, the plate\u2019s low thickness enables the treatment of \n\nheat removed from the element in the holes of the perforated pattern in a convective \n\nresistance term where it is considered along with the convection on the element\u2019s (and \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nthus the plate\u2019s) windward face. The discussion above retains the possibility of using a \n\nvolumetric sink term and the finite difference code developed for simulation purposes \n\n(see Appendix A) can be readily adapted to take into account a variable sink term, \n\nwhich indeed remains built into the formulation (albeit as a constant) and will be used \n\nin the first simple simulations, where various heat sink terms will be considered for \n\ncomparison with the GF and CFD approaches. \n\nThese initial simulations are intended to gain confidence in the approaches in \n\nsituations where anomalous results would be sufficiently clear to stand out and simple \n\nto analyze. The relative merits of the possible approaches can also be compared with \n\nease and decisions regarding their implementation taken with more confidence. \n\nRegarding the use of the GF approach in a one-dimensional radial approach \n\nwith an imposed temperature Text on the outer radius a, the aforementioned one-\n\ndimensional GR01 function is necessary, that is: \n\n \n\n ( )\n( ) ( )\n\n( )\n\n2\n2\n\n'\n( ) 0 0'\n\n01 2 2\n1 1\n\n1\n, | , i\n\nt a i i\n\nR\ni i\n\nJ r a J r a\nG r t r e\n\na J\n\n? ? ? ??\n?\n\n? ?\n\n? ? ?\n\n=\n\n= ? ,  (2.51) \n\n \n\nwhere J0 and J1 are Bessel functions of the first kind. Note that the formulation would \n\nbe written in the same manner if a long cylinder where the effect of conditions on its \n\nextremities would be insignificant was considered.

Thus, \n\nan alternative solution was tested, where the contribution of the non-homogeneous \n\nboundary, i.e. the third term on the second member of Equation 2.56, is given as [Cole \n\net al. 2010]: \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n( ) ( )\n\n( )\n\n2\n2\n\n'\n\n'\n( ) 0 0 ' '\n\next 2 20\n1 1\n\n1\n1 2 di\n\na t a i i\n\nr\ni i\n\nJ r a J r a\nT e r r\n\na J\n\n? ? ? ??\n?\n\n? ?\n\n? ? ?\n\n=\n=\n\n? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?\n?? .  (2.57) \n\n \n\nA converged solution employing fewer than 50 terms in the series was found \n\nusing the alternative solution, while for 1000 terms the slower version employing the \n\nnon-homogeneous condition still had not converged. The alternative solution was \n\ntherefore employed in the following calculations. \n\nA simple one-dimensional radial case can thus be studied using both the GF \n\nformulation and the finite difference method, and the same study can be easily \n\nimplemented in CFD software, with all the necessary flexibility in terms of geometry \n\ncreation and boundary condition specification, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. \n\nFigure 2.9 illustrates one of the reasons of the choice of Mathematica as the \n\nsoftware for implementing Green\u2019s functions. The ease of specification of integrals, sums \n\nand Bessel functions necessary to the calculations is readily apparent.  \n\nAs a starting point for the comparative study, a simple radial conduction case \n\nwas considered, with adiabatic tops as far as the thin plate is concerned, no nodal \n\nbalances due to convection or radiation having to be performed in finite differences and \n\nno need to perform updating procedures discussed earlier and summarized in Figure 2.1 \n\nneeding to be considered for the GF solution. For simplicity, no variations in material \n\nproperties were considered, although this will not be the case later. Properties were \n\nassumed to be those of stainless steel at ambient temperatures, in all three methods. \n\nFrom the variety of tests carried out, two are described and their conditions \n\nsummarized in Table 2.5. As discussed earlier, the negative heat generation term can be \n\nthought of as heat sink that will lead to an amount of heat to be removed from the \n\nplate by convection due to the temperature difference between the transpiration airflow \n\nand the perforated pattern, but that the magnitude of the temperatures in the plate are \n\nultimately dictated not only by convection but also by the radiative interaction \n\nbetween the sensing element\u2019s surface and its hot surroundings, via the radiative \n\nsource\u2019s area and emissivity and the element\u2019s own reflectivity, emissivity and \n\ntransmissivity. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 ANSYS CFX implementation of radial transient heat conduction in a thin plate. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Mathematica implementation of the R01 Green\u2019s function. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\nTransient temperature curves at the centre of the plate (the region where the \n\nthermocouple will be installed in the prototype) were determined along with radial \n\ntemperature distributions as a function of time at several timesteps. Regarding the \n\nimplementation of GF, this was done by plotting the T(r,t) distribution both as a \n\nfunction of radius r and time t. \n\nRadial temperature distributions in the plate for Case 1 (see Table 2.5) \n\nobtained using GFSE are shown in Figures 2.10 for times 0.2, 0.5 and 1 s, as well as for \n\nfully converged steady-state conditions.

The \n\nquestion of comparing the accuracy of the GF method results with those of the finite \n\ndifferences approach makes sense and its usefulness cannot be questioned from the \n\npoint of view of obtaining analytical insight into the problem. Its separation of effects \n\ncaused by initial temperature fields, generation terms and boundary conditions is \n\nespecially relevant. In these conditions, where the element\u2019s thermal behaviour is \n\nentirely dictated by the initial temperature field and constant boundary temperatures \n\nand generation terms, the GF method can be looked upon as an exact analytical \n\nsolution where no manipulations are necessary besides the integrations and sums \n\ndescribed in Equations 2.52 to 2.57. From this point of view and only for these \n\nparticular conditions, the GF method can be regarded as an analytical benchmark for \n\nthe numerical CFX and finite differences methods. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the GF method may become inaccurate if variations in \n\nboundary conditions fail to be taken into account. In the absence of explicit analytical \n\ndescriptions of these variations, some form of updating procedure is necessary. New \n\nanalytical functions for all necessary parameters can be obtained at time intervals short \n\nenough to ensure that no relevant transient variations are missed, based on energy \n\nbalances at a number of spatial points in space sufficient to ensure that spatial \n\naccuracy is retained. The functions obtained in this manner are used as the initial \n\ntemperature fields, generation/sink terms and boundary conditions for the subsequent \n\ntime iteration. \n\nIn so doing the GF method becomes a sort of hybrid, with an analytical basis \n\nbut requiring iterative numerical procedures to recalculate boundary conditions in order \n\nto maintain its accuracy. Furthermore, most practical situations, and certainly the one \n\nunder discussion in the present document, will need to take into account variations in \n\nthe intensity of generation/sink terms and of boundary conditions such as the radiative \n\nand convective exchanges with surroundings, even if the overall system is one-\n\ndimensional along its radius, as assumed here. \n\nNumerical methods such as finite differences or finite elements are intrinsically \n\niterative (even in steady-state formulations and, inherently more so, in transient \n\napproaches) and their formulation explicitly considers the diversity of heat transfer \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nmodes that can take place at the boundaries as discussed earlier for finite differences, \n\nwhere various resistance terms were defined for each phenomenon. \n\nAlthough elegant in formal terms, computationally powerful in some situations \n\nand always useful as a fully analytical approach, the iterative procedure for GF is less \n\ninteresting than the inherently iterative transient finite differences approach, which \n\nthus becomes more economical in computational terms, if less compact in the \n\ndescription of the problem when compared with an analytical approach.  \n\nFrom the point of view taken in this document, GFSE is first and foremost a \n\npowerful analytical tool that in this particular case is less flexible and more \n\ncumbersome to implement than an intrinsically numerical and iterative finite \n\ndifferences approach. The latter method will therefore be used in more detailed \n\ncomparisons with the commercial CFD software. These will consider the actual \n\ngeometry of the components, namely its perforated pattern, by relying on the \n\nrelationships obtained above for convection heat transfer coefficients as a function of \n\ntranspiration airflows, as well as on the correction factors for convective and radiative \n\nheat transfer areas and element volumes. The variations of material properties with \n\ntemperature will also be considered.  \n\nThe two purely numerical methods were tested for situations where radiation \n\nand convection are present, in order to compare results from the purpose-developed \n\nfinite difference model with those of the commercial software. The same thin plate as \n\nbefore was used, but with air at a given temperature on one side, and surroundings \n\nwith a predefined temperature and no convection on the other, allowing the study of \n\nconditions more closely akin to those of the perforated plate to be studied subsequently. \n\nPurely convective and radiative boundaries were first studied separately and later \n\ncombined, and good concordance between the results obtained from CFX and finite \n\ndifferences was apparent. \n\nThe transient transpiration principle to be used in practice was also tested by \n\nusing results from simulations at a given transpiration airflow level as initial values for \n\nsubsequent simulations where the airflow is diminished or eliminated. This process only \n\nrequires the necessary adjustments in terms of boundary conditions, especially as far as \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\nthe convection coefficient is concerned, since no significant airflow will be considered \n\nand values for natural convection can be used. \n\nA final test was performed before moving on to the simulation of the full scale \n\nsystem, which can be thought of as a simpler version of the perforated plate \n\nsimulations that must later be studied.  \n\nIn terms of CFX, the setup is merely a small circular section of the perforated \n\nplate with the same perforation patterns as the definitive plate and similar to those \n\ndiscussed above. This plate is exposed to radiation from the furnace on one side while \n\nbeing cooled by a transpiration airflow crossing it from the other, with an imposed \n\ntemperature at the outer radius. A comparison is intended with the numerical model \n\nrelying on finite differences that was developed and discussed above, including the \n\ncorrelations for the convection coefficient and the area correction factors. While not \n\nexpected to be as accurate as the CFD simulation, since it does not take into account \n\nall the complex behaviours, such as turbulence, that occur in the interaction between \n\nthe perforated plate and both its hot surroundings and its cooling transpiration airflow, \n\nthe model is nevertheless expected to provide reasonable values for the transient \n\ntemperature fields within the element. This simplified setup also allows for much faster \n\nsimulations. Temperature results are shown in Figure 2.20. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.20 \u2013 CFX setup of the small perforated section and illustration of the resulting \n\ntemperature field. \n\n \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n\nAs before, radial temperature profiles at various timesteps were obtained, for \n\nvarious radiation source temperatures and several different mass flows. An example is \n\nillustrated in Figures 2.21 and 2.22 for a mass flow of 0.001 kgs-1 at 298 K, a radiative \n\nsource at 1023 K and an imposed temperature at the outer radius of 473 K, which is \n\nalso the plate uniform initial temperature.  \n\nAn interesting feature of the CFX curves is the slight \u201cwobble\u201d that occurs in \n\nthe radial temperature profiles and that is due to the fact that the curve along the \n\nradial direction where values were sampled passes close to the holes, although not \n\nintersecting them. This effect is obviously absent from the finite differences curves. \n\nThe curve behaviours are similar and a comparison of the scales of the graphs of \n\nFigures 2.21 and 2.22 shows that calculated values for the two methods differ in less \n\nthan 10% in all cases. Figure 2.23 likewise illustrates the transient temperature curves \n\nat the centre of the plate, with 10% error bars placed on the finite differences results \n\ncurve emphasizing the difference between calculated values. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.21 \u2013 Radial temperature profiles using CFX. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n410\n\n420\n\n430\n\n440\n\n450\n\n460\n\n470\n\n480\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nT\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n [\nK\n]\n\nRadius [mm]\n\n0 s\n\nCFX 0.005 s\n\nCFX 0.01 s\n\nCFX 0.05 s\n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.22 \u2013 Radial temperature profiles using finite differences. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.23 \u2013 Transient temperatures at the centre of the plate. \n\n \n\nThe results from these studies show that the finite differences model is able to \n\nprocess the same physical problem as the commercial CFD software and that the \n\ncorrelation obtained for the convection coefficient provides accurate values.

The comparison of an explicit method (such as finite differences as \n\nimplemented here) with the implicit methods on which CFX relies, compounded by \n\nlocal heterogeneities such as the microperforated pattern, was expected to lead to even \n\ngreater differences. From this viewpoint, the obtained results are satisfactory given the \n\nsimplicity of the approach and the assumptions and simplifications made. \n\nInsight about the various occurring physical phenomena was nevertheless gained \n\nfrom the development and testing of the GF and finite differences models and \n\nconfidence in the results of the CFD software was enhanced by the comparisons that \n\nwere carried out, building on previous experience with such software. \n\n2.5 Concluding Remarks \n\nThe present chapter was devoted to the description of the instrument\u2019s working \n\nprinciple and to possible formulations for the study of the sensing element\u2019s behaviour.  \n\nThe problem requirements were first of all discussed and subsequent \n\nsimplifications were implemented as necessary and once their reasonability was \n\nestablished. Among these requirements, the need to take into account a non-\n\nhomogeneous transient problem was foremost, especially given the presence of the \n\ninteraction between a perforated plate being heated by radiation and a colder \n\ntranspiration airflow crossing the pattern of holes, leading to the analytical treatment \n\nof such an interaction as a heat sink term. \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\nThe GF method was recognized as being well suited to the task of providing an \n\nanalytical solution to the heat diffusion equation within the three-dimensional \n\ncylindrical system embodied by the sensor element, and a proper methodology was \n\nestablished in order to implement the GF method and solve the conduction problem in \n\norder to obtain temperature values for all locations and instants of interest, for a \n\nvariety of cases. Concurrently, a finite differences approach was also found to be \n\nadequate for the same purpose, with added benefits in terms of implementation in \n\nconditions where boundary conditions require updating in space and time. \n\nIn order to describe the phenomena that needed to be integrated into the model, \n\nrelationships were obtained for convection heat transfer coefficients as a function of \n\ntranspiration airflows, together with correction factors intended to take into account \n\nthe perforation parameters of the sensing element. Given the latter\u2019s low thickness and \n\nafter studying the areas involved in convective and radiative heat transfer processes, a \n\ndecision was taken to treat the heat transfer in the holes together with convection in \n\nthe windward face of the plate. Nevertheless, the formulation necessary to deal with a \n\nvolumetric generation/sink term was obtained and discussed, and remains built into the \n\nformulation for use in a different set of assumptions if necessary. \n\nA comparison of results of both approaches with those of equivalent CFD \n\nsimulations of the same physical problems showed good approximation and \n\nsimultaneously provided both increased confidence in the results provided by the GFSE \n\nand validation for the simulations to be carried out for dimensioning purposes using \n\nCFD software. \n\nThe use of the CFD software was always intended for design purposes, not only \n\nregarding the sensing element itself but especially when considering the overall \n\ninstrument as a system consisting of various components, rather than merely as a \n\nsensing element. The methodologies proposed and discussed showed reduced simulation \n\ntimes and overall computational effort for the type of geometry of interest, parametric \n\ntests regarding physical parameters of the sensing element and operational conditions \n\nsuch as airflows can be conducted merely by adjusting unit cell parameters or relevant \n\ntemperatures, airflows and convection coefficients using the developed correlations. \n\nRelevant information about the sensing element\u2019s behaviour regarding temperature \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\nspatial distributions, transient variations or its time constant ?  for various conditions \n\ncan thus be obtained at a fraction of the computational effort of CFD simulations. \n\nLikewise, relevant phenomena such as those arising from the pulsed \n\ntranspiration airflows to be employed in practice can be implemented with reasonable \n\nresults at a fraction of the computational effort required for CFD simulations.  \n\nThese numerical results, along with the insight gained into the physical \n\nprocesses at work within and around the sensing element, are felt to fully justify the \n\neffort that was put into the development of the analytical and numerical methods \n\nproposed, implemented and discussed in the present chapter. This is especially relevant \n\nregarding the finite differences approach that was extended with good results to a \n\ndomain of application, i.e. the transient interaction between a transpiration airflow and \n\na perforated plate exposed to convective and radiative boundary conditions that was \n\nnot encountered in any bibliographical reference, although others unknown applications \n\nof the sort obviously cannot be ruled out. \n\n  \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\nDIMENSIONING PROCEDURES AND \n\nPARAMETRIC STUDIES \n\n \n\nThe overall configuration of the system is studied, together with \n\ndimensional and operational parameters that influence sensor \n\nperformance. Assumptions and simplifications made in the process of \n\ndeveloping the analytical model are discussed, along with the \n\ninstrument\u2019s dimensioning and design procedures, taking into account \n\nconclusions from the previous chapter and establishing the procedures \n\nnecessary for carrying out various analytical and numerical parametric \n\nstudies as far as relevant mass flow values, boundary layer control, \n\ncompressibility and transmissivity in the microperforated plate, \n\ntransient effects or the cooling system are concerned. \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe ultimate goal of the work described here is an instrument for the measurement of \n\nconvective and radiative heat fluxes which would overcome drawbacks noted in \n\nconventional heat flux meters (or at least in existing transpiration radiometers such as \n\nthe one from which the present work originated) by having several desirable advantages \n\nthat cannot be found in conventional instruments, namely: \n\n\u2022 A more compact configuration and a less complex system by the use of air \n\ncooling both in a microperforated low-thickness sensing element and in a porous \n\nholder/outer casing; \n\n\u2022 A significantly reduced response time obtained through a lower overall thermal \n\ninertia and the implementation of the transient response analysis; \n\n\u2022 An effective heat flux partitioning (i.e. splitting the total heat flux into the \n\nradiative and convective components thereof) achieved through a pulsed airflow \n\noperation mode. \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nThe proposed sensing element is to have a much lower thermal inertia than those of \n\nearlier instruments and exhibit faster temperature variations in time, while being much \n\nmore efficiently refrigerated, thus reducing cooling requirements. This makes the \n\navoidance of excessive temperatures within the system much easier, renders using air \n\ncooling a viable option and has several interesting consequences, such as: \n\n\u2022 Lesser refrigeration needs allow the use of a much less complicated and more \n\ncompact refrigeration system when compared with conventional transpiration \n\nradiometers, which use water refrigeration systems that require more parts in \n\nmore complex configurations and, consequently, added manufacturing, assembly \n\nand maintenance complexities; \n\n\u2022 A faster response using an operational mode where transient behaviours are \n\ninduced by variations in the transpiration airflow can be defined. It was proven \n\nearlier [Hit 2004, Martins et al. 2006a, Martins et al. 2006b] that the slope of \n\nthe line tangent to the temperature response curve is directly proportional to \n\nthe total heat flux received by a porous disc, making it unnecessary to \u201cwait\u201d \n\nfor steady-state values and using the transient output of the radiometer to \n\ndetermine the incident heat flux. The necessary transient behaviour is induced \n\nby using a pulsed transpiration gas mass flow; \n\n\u2022 The transient behaviour induced by using a pulsed transpiration gas mass flow \n\nmay also enable the implementation of heat flux partitioning, since the airflow \n\ncan be made subcritical for short time periods in order to measure the total \n\nheat flux rather than only the radiative component, temperature levels being \n\nnevertheless kept within acceptable levels. This ability has not been achieved by \n\nearlier instruments. \n\nThe proposed microperforated plate maintains established advantages of \n\ntranspiration radiometers such as their protection from fouling by soot particles and \n\ntheir ability to withstand high temperature and heat flux environments, provided by \n\nthe preservation of the air mass flow on which the transpiration radiometer principle is \n\nbased \n\nThe pulsed operation principle dictates that the effect of the various mass flows to \n\nbe considered must be described, especially as far as temperature fields within the disk, \n\ntime responses and heat flux partitioning are concerned. Received heat fluxes were \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\nproven to be directly proportional to the slope of the tangent to the temperature \n\nresponse curve, which in turn allows an anticipation of the instrument\u2019s steady-state \n\nvalues. The faster response of the proposed instrument enables its integration in \n\nstrongly time-dependant systems, and its reduced bulk and weight are useful in systems \n\nwhere such restrictions may apply. \n\nThe main conceptual difficulty in the passage from the actual physical system to its \n\nanalytical or numerical description is taking into account the microperforated pattern \n\nthat underlies the transpiration radiometer principle, in order to evaluate the effect of \n\nthe various mass flows that will cross the plate. This difficulty is evident in any kind of \n\nanalytical approach, so that some simplifications had to be made. As described earlier, \n\na description of the cooling effect of the airflow was achieved by treating it as a heat \n\nsink term integrated both in a Green\u2019s functions formulation and a finite difference \n\nscheme, used for the purpose of obtaining a solutions to the boundary value problem \n\nresulting from the physical conditions of the sensor, and comparisons with CFD \n\nsimulations confirmed the soundness of the approach. \n\nTreating the presence of a large number of small holes with variable physical \n\nconditions is not straightforward. As far as the use of CFD tools is concerned, \n\nnumerous small features usually involve more geometrically complex models and \n\ntypically require additional mesh refinements for adequate accuracy, and compromises \n\nmust be reached regarding these requirements versus computational times and \n\nnecessary computer resources. However, previous experience with CFD tools was extant \n\nand the comparisons made with GFSE and finite difference calculations described in \n\nthe Chapter 2 justified their use for more detailed simulations, especially those intended \n\nto study features that could not be taken into account, as the microperforated pattern, \n\nor parts of the system that are not central to the discussion and that for that reason \n\nwere not considered in the analytical model, such as the external refrigeration system.  \n\nThus, much of the overall design relies both on standard fluid mechanics and heat \n\ntransfer analytical tools, as well as on CFD. The selection of physical and operational \n\nparameters, as well as performance analysis of the proposed heat flux measurement \n\ninstrument, also relies on CFD, along with various analytical principles described in \n\ndetail below. \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\n3.2 Proposed Configuration, Objectives and Approach \n\nThe proposed microperforated sensing element, central to the intended instrument \n\nperformance, was discussed above and especially in Chapter 2 but must itself be \n\nanalysed in terms of the temperature fields developed within it, not only when \n\ninteracting with high-temperature environments and external cooling systems, but \n\nespecially in interaction with various transpiration mass flows and taking into account \n\nphenomena such as gas compressibility and transmissivity to the incident radiation. \n\nDecisions needed to be taken beforehand regarding the overall configuration of \n\nthe instrument, especially concerning how necessary airflows are handled and the \n\nexternal refrigeration system\u2019s features and dimensioning. Given the stated objective of \n\nusing a less cumbersome (both in terms of dimensions and complexity) solution than \n\nwater cooling (which led to more parts in more complex configurations, with added \n\nmanufacturing, assembly and maintenance complexity), compressed air is the most \n\nobvious alternative. Although any suitable cooling gas can be used, air is the most \n\nstraightforward choice, considering its availability and cost effectiveness. Nevertheless, \n\nthe question of how to make this airflow interact with the rest of the system remained. \n\nThis was addressed by using a refrigeration airflow (separate from the aforementioned \n\ntranspiration airflow) that interacts with a porous steel part that serves both as a \n\nsensing element holder and as an outer casing for the overall system. This porous part \n\nmakes use of the large specific area (defined as the ratio between the surface area \n\navailable for heat transfer and the volume) of the porous parts to effectively interact \n\nwith the stream of cooling air and render a proper design and dimensioning process \n\nnecessary. \n\nEven if the airflows come from the same compressed air source or circuit, they \n\nmust be somehow separated in order to adequately play their roles. This can be \n\nachieved by placing a solid component within the porous outer casing, that should be \n\nas thin as possible in order not to unduly increase overall thermal inertia while being \n\nsufficiently sturdy to withstand the pressures of the compressed air flows and the \n\nstresses of the welding process to which it will be subjected during prototype \n\nconstruction. This component can take the form of a hollow cone placed within the \n\nsensor casing, below the microperforated plate. \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\nThe porous holder must be placed atop and joined to a non-porous base that \n\nhouses the refrigeration airflow tube and the conical component. The refrigeration \n\nairflow enters the non-porous base tangentially in order to provide it with a swirl \n\ncomponent and therefore to increase its residence time in the space between the cone \n\nand the porous holder, when compared to a situation where its injection would be made \n\nalong the part\u2019s revolution axis, i.e. parallel to the transpiration airflow. All joints \n\nbetween the porous holder, the non-porous base and the cone must necessarily be \n\nairtight and be achieved with welding or brazing. \n\n Temperature measurements in the microperforated plate are made using a 0.25 \n\nmm diameter thermocouple that is passed inside the conical element through a sealed \n\nhole in its lower tube, and is then connected by laser welding to the centre of the \n\nmicroperforated plate using a slightly larger central hole for guidance. The plate is then \n\nattached (e.g. brazed) to the porous holder in order to guarantee air tightness around \n\nits rim. This assembly dispenses with moving parts. \n\nOnce the compressed air tubes are connected to supply lines and the \n\nthermocouple is connected to a data acquisition system, which also controls an \n\nelectrovalve that regulates the pulsed transpiration airflow using the associated \n\nsoftware, the instrument is ready to measure heat fluxes. \n\nIllustrated in Figures 3.1 to 3.4 is the proposed overall configuration of the \n\nsystem (definition drawings of each of the various components). The dimensions that \n\nare shown were specified once the dimensioning procedures described in this chapter \n\nwere complete and prospective providers for the parts were consulted, since some \n\nadjustments required by the manufacturing processes had to be made. An exploded and \n\nan assembly view are also provided in Figures 3.5 and 3.6 respectively.  \n\n \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Microperforated plate definition drawing. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Non-porous base definition drawing. \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Cone definition drawing. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Porous holder definition drawing. \n\n \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Exploded view of main prototype components. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Prototype assembly. \n\n \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\nIn order to produce viable instrument prototypes, the plate\u2019s overall physical \n\nparameters, such as its diameter, thickness and material, must therefore be defined. Its \n\nperforated pattern must also be defined in terms of diameter, spacing and placement. \n\nGiven the fact that the proposed instrument is essentially (despite all aforementioned \n\ndifferences with conventional versions) a transpiration heat flux meter, conditions for \n\nthe implementation of the boundary layer blow-off principle must be ensured, as this \n\nrequirement has a direct impact on the definition of a proper perforated pattern. This \n\nmeant that analytical models that describe boundary layer blow-off for various \n\nsituations were examined and used to determine necessary gas mass flows, regardless of \n\nparticular features of the perforated plate. \n\nOnce the necessary compressed air mass flows are determined, the matter of \n\npassing them through a microperforated pattern also raises the question of knowing \n\nwhether the considerable difference in diameter between the feed line tubes and the \n\nplate holes, along with pressure differences between both sides of the plate, can give \n\nrise to compressibility and choked flow conditions that can place an upper limit to the \n\npassable mass flow through each hole and therefore trough the overall perforated \n\npattern, that must be dimensioned accordingly. \n\nHowever, the selection of perforated pattern parameters must consider one other \n\nphenomenon, namely a radiation transmissivity term that was absent in the sensing \n\nelements of earlier instruments because of their opacity. This led to the need to \n\nadequately describe and calculate the transmissivity of a perforated thin plate, to \n\nspecify a maximum acceptable value (since it cannot be avoided) and to adjust the \n\nperforation parameters accordingly. Care must be taken to avoid possible undesirable \n\neffects such as extraordinary transmission phenomena. This makes necessary some \n\nfurther caution regarding the interaction between incident radiation (namely as far as \n\nits wavelength is concerned) and the holes of the microperforated pattern. \n\nThe procedures described above result in the definition of the geometric and \n\ndimensional features of the various system components, together with its physical \n\nproperties. Nonetheless, other studies remain to be carried out, namely as far as \n\noperational parameters or transient effects are concerned. Parameters such as the \n\nmagnitude of the transpiration and refrigeration airflows or external medium \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\ntemperatures, as well as their relationships with temperatures developed within the \n\nsensing element, must be carefully addressed. \n\nFor any given set of conditions in the high-temperature environment, \n\nconsiderable transpiration gas flows are required in order to provide enough \n\nrefrigeration to keep temperature fields in the sensing element within acceptable limits \n\nand to lower surface temperatures, diminishing the magnitude of radial flows within the \n\nmicroperforated plate (overall temperatures being closer to the temperature imposed on \n\nthe outer radius) and rendering the emission term much less significant. This principle \n\nwas already applied to nullify these terms in energy balances for sensing elements of \n\nprevious instruments [Martins 1998].  \n\nHigh gas flows also have other advantages such as a more effective deflection of \n\nincoming soot particles, while the lower temperatures place less severe constraints on \n\nthe outer refrigeration system. In earlier transpiration instruments, large airflows were \n\nindispensible at all times in order to provide refrigeration, which meant that convection \n\nmeasurements were never performed because the airflow could not be interrupted, in \n\norder to impede the hot gases from making contact with the sensor surface. Typical \n\nairflows ranged from 10 to 60 SLPM (Standard Litres per Minute) while in the work \n\ndescribed here significantly lower values are expected thanks to much-reduced \n\nrefrigeration needs. In order to always be able to blow-off the boundary layer, this \n\nvalue is nevertheless strongly overdimensioned. \n\nWhat happens within the sensing element when the pulsed operation results in \n\nsubcritical mass flow values is also of particular relevance, given the transpiration \n\nairflow\u2019s refrigeration role. Care must be taken in order to ensure that excessive \n\ntemperatures are not reached during those situations. Such transient effects must be \n\nstudied and anticipated beforehand. This means that while the transpiration airflow \n\nmust be known with precision in order to quantify its effect in terms of time-varying \n\ntemperature fields in the sensing element and of boundary layer blow-off, the \n\nrefrigeration airflow can, if necessary, be set at a maximum value, regardless of other \n\nconsiderations. \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\n3.3 Dimensioning and Design Procedures \n\n3.3.1 Basic Assumptions \n\nThe proposed changes discussed earlier in terms of overall configuration, operation \n\nmode and physical features do not make reasonable a direct transposition of the \n\nspecifications of components of earlier instruments. This does not mean that some \n\nitems do not have similar dimensions between instruments, even if these can in some \n\ncases be somewhat arbitrarily imposed, the most obvious example probably being the \n\nsensing element\u2019s frontal area. The earlier instruments mentioned before used a sensing \n\nelement with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 4 mm [Martins 1998]. Besides \n\nallowing some form of comparison, this diameter results in a manageable part that \n\nallows for the intended reduction in both overall dimensions and thermal inertia, and \n\nwas thus specified as a basic parameter. \n\nAs already mentioned, an example of application of low thickness \n\nmicroperforated plates was found in espresso machine filters that were around 0.1 mm \n\nin thickness. These samples showed adequate thermal behaviour and good mechanical \n\nresistance. Thus, the idea to use similar components for the instrument\u2019s sensing \n\nelement was naturally considered. A survey of providers, manufacturing technologies \n\nand prices for obtaining the plates resulted in the selection of photo-etched rather than \n\nmicro-machined components. This technique is very useful in obtaining the required \n\ncomponents effectively but has the limitation that holes with diameters smaller than \n\nthe plate thickness are extremely difficult to obtain, thus placing limits on hole \n\ndiameter to plate thickness ratios. \n\nAll other component dimensions were thus specified using the referred diameter \n\nand thickness values as starting points, although some had to be subsequently slightly \n\nadjusted due either to the dimensioning procedures and numerical studies discussed \n\nbelow, or to limitations imposed by the various manufacturing processes. Some of these \n\noccurred while some components were already under production but no significant \n\nchanges were required, the only noteworthy one being the change in effective diameter \n\nof the microperforated pattern that came about due to a need to increase the cone wall \n\nthickness when it was no longer possible to adjust the porous holder\u2019s inside diameter. \n\nThis meant that the porous holder has an internal diameter of 10.5 mm, the cone wall \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nis 0.5 mm in thickness and thus has an internal diameter of 9.5 mm rather than the \n\nintended 10 mm. The microperforated pattern was extended to a diameter of 9.75 mm \n\nin order to ensure it covers as much area as possible by overlapping the top of the cone. \n\n3.3.2 Boundary Layer Control, Mass Flow Rate and Compressibility \n\nin the Microperforated Plate \n\nA central aspect of the proposed heat flux measurement method is the possibility of \n\nenabling an effective heat flux partitioning which, as discussed earlier, requires the \n\nelimination of the boundary layer on top of the sensing element. The transpiration \n\ncooling principle of blowing a gas stream through a porous wall is especially useful \n\nbearing in mind that the perforated plate is merely a particularly well-ordered porous \n\nmedium. If the blowing gas mass flow is sufficiently high, the aerodynamic and thermal \n\nboundary layers developing on the porous surface are destroyed and the convective \n\nheat transfer from the main stream to the considered surface is eliminated. \n\nThe effect of a transpiration cross stream on the Nusselt number for a laminar \n\nboundary layer developing on porous wall is well established, relationships for the \n\nlimiting conditions of a main stream parallel and perpendicular to a flat plate [Hartnett \n\nand Eckert 1957], as well as for turbulent boundary layers being available [Kutateladze \n\nand Leontiev 1964, Leontiev 1966]. Subsequent work focused mainly on empirical and \n\nnumerical studies, with a particular emphasis on the latter [Tedeschi et al. 1995, \n\nFranca et al. 1998].  \n\nThe critical transpiration gas (CTG) mass flow rate required to promote the \n\ndestruction of the boundary layer over the porous disc is a basic parameter to be \n\ndefined for the proposed heat flux sensor. In the definition of the CTG mass flow rate it \n\nis necessary to consider the laminar or turbulent nature of the mainstream flow (i.e. on \n\nthe furnace side), its velocity and temperature, the density ? between the TG and the \n\nmain stream gas, as well as the local geometry. The local Reynolds number Rex defines \n\nthe boundary layer nature, while the density difference is defined mainly by \n\ntemperature differences, the influence of the geometry being introduced through an \n\nappropriated choice of Nusselt number correlation.  \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\nA variety of expressions is available for mass flows (typically given in kgs-1) or \n\nmass fluxes (in kgs-1m-2) in various situations, namely laminar or turbulent flows over \n\nflat plates or stagnation situations. A comparative study of these various transpiration \n\nmass flow or flux relationships is available, with some very useful conclusions [Martins \n\n1998]. This comparison was conducted for the purpose of determining not only the \n\ncritical blow-off mass flow or flux for any given situation, but also in order to study its \n\nsensitivity to various parameters. For the blow-off a laminar boundary layer, the \n\nfollowing relationship is valid for 0.7 &lt;Pr &lt;1 [Hartnett and Eckert 1957]: \n\n \n\n 0 0\nw,cr\n\nx\nRe\n\nv\nj C\n\n?\n\n?\n= ,  (3.1) \n\n \n\nwhere C = 0.62 for laminar flow over a flat plate and C = 2.35 for laminar stagnation \n\nplane flow, while the air density ratio is: \n\n \n\n 0\n\nw\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n= ,  (3.2) \n\n \n\n?0 and ?w  being the air densities for the main stream and at the porous wall, \n\nrespectively. For a turbulent boundary layer and ? &lt;1, the following equation was \n\npreviously proposed [Martins 1998]: \n\n \n\n ( )\n2\n\n1\n0.112 5\n\nw,cr x 0 0 x\n\n1 11\n0.02888 ln 1 1.32 Re Re\n\n1 1 1\nj v\n\n?\n?\n\n? ?\n\n??\n? ?? ??+ ??? ???= +?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?\n\n.  (3.3) \n\n \n\nIt was found that the sensitivity of the critical mass flux relatively to the \n\ndensity ratio is higher for the laminar boundary layer. This is important information \n\ngiven the fact that the main stream temperature is not necessarily known. Another \n\nconclusion was that for Rex > 10\n5 the limiting critical mass flux is always given by the \n\nlaw for a turbulent boundary layer, regardless of the value of the density ratio.  \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\nFor Rex &lt;10\n5 the value of the limiting flux is not so clear and actually depends \n\non the effective transition Rex, that is the laminar or turbulent nature of the boundary \n\nlayer, the density ratio ? and the main stream flow direction relatively to the sensor \n\nsurface (parallel or stagnation flow). The mass flux values necessary for boundary layer \n\nblow-off are also higher than for Rex > 10\n5, as illustrated in Fig. 3.7, where the CTG \n\nmass flux as a function of Rex and ? is plotted. Once it is not possible to predict the \n\nReynolds number for which transition occurs, the relations for the turbulent boundary \n\nlayer were plotted for the whole Reynolds number range [Martins 1998]: \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 Critical transpiration gas (CTG) mass flux as a function of Rex and ? for turbulent \n\nboundary layers, a laminar boundary layer in a stagnation flow and a laminar boundary layer \n\ndeveloping along a flat plate [Martins 1998]. \n\n \n\nIt can be observed that the critical mass flux is given in an adimensional form \n\nwhere mass flux j, with units in kilograms per second per square meter, is divided by \n\nthe main stream velocity and density. Results in Figure 3.7 mean that in order to \n\nalways guarantee an effective blow-off, the relationship valid for laminar boundary \n\nlayer on a stagnation plane flow valid for  0.7 &lt;Pr &lt;1.0 can be used for CTG \n\ncalculation, that is: \n\n \n\n\n\n123 \n\n \n\n 0 0\nw,cr\n\nx\n\n2.35\nRe\n\nv\nj\n\n?\n\n?\n=   (3.4) \n\n \n\nThe Reynolds number for the main stream must also be specified for the \n\nstagnation flow situation: \n\n \n\n Re\nvL?\n\n\u00b5\n= .  (3.5) \n\n \n\nThe characteristic length L was considered to be the same as the perforated \n\nplate\u2019s diameter which, in effect, corresponds to a situation where a nozzle would be \n\nblowing straight at the perforated plate. Although arguably unrealistic, this assumption \n\nis helpful in the specification of an assuredly critical transpiration flow. The density can \n\nbe calculated as before, while the dynamic viscosity of the fluid can be found from the \n\nstandard power law: \n\n \n\n \n0 0\n\nn\n\nT\n\nT\n\n\u00b5\n\n\u00b5\n\n? ??? ??= ?? ???? ?\n,  (3.6) \n\n \n\nwhere n = 0.7 for air and \u00b50 is a known dynamic viscosity at temperature 0T , usually \n\n1.71\u00d710-5  Nsm-2 at 273 K [White 1998]. It should also be noted that the fluid density \n\nand velocity used in the calculation of the main stream Reynolds number are the same \n\nused in the determination of the critical transpiration mass flow. \n\n The calculation of the CTG does not take into account any parameters related \n\nto the porous medium being crossed by the transpiration airflow. Previous transpiration \n\nradiometers used large mass flows in order to ensure boundary layer blow-off while \n\nproviding additional refrigeration to keep temperature fields in the sensing element \n\nwithin acceptable bounds and to minimize the surface radiation emission [Martins \n\n1998]. This means that a sensing element with a much lower thermal inertia could fulfil \n\nsuch requirements while relying on either smaller transpiration airflows or less bulky \n\nrefrigeration systems than previous instruments. In any case, once a CTG value is \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n\nobtained, the question remains about how it will interact with the porous element it is \n\ncrossing in thermal and dynamic terms.   \n\nThe fact that the sensing element being studied is a thin plate with a \n\nmicroperforated array of small holes also raises questions about the behaviour of the \n\ntranspiration airflow when transitioning from the feed tube to the plate itself, since the \n\nlarge difference in flow areas raises possible compressibility issues that may result in \n\nchoked flow conditions and inhibit mass flow increases that could be necessary in order \n\nto ensure boundary layer blow-off. Furthermore, given the fact that the transpiration \n\nand refrigeration airflows are provided by compressed air at several times the \n\natmospheric pressure, sonic flow is likely to occur since pressure ratios as low as 2:1 \n\nmay be sufficient for its occurrence.  \n\nFor given stagnation conditions, the maximum possible mass flow passes \n\nthrough a duct when its throat is at the critical or sonic condition. The duct is said to \n\nbe choked and can carry no additional mass flow unless the throat is widened. \n\nCompressible flow theory available in any of the standard textbooks states that for \n\nisentropic flow through a duct (a common and convenient assumption) the maximum \n\nmass flow possible is proportional to the throat area and stagnation pressure, and \n\ninversely proportional to the square root of the stagnation temperature, which for air  \n\n(? = cp/cv = 1.4) reduces to [White 1998]: \n\n \n\n \n*\n\n0\nmax\n\n0\n\n0.6847p A\nm\n\nRT\n=?

While the velocity is merely the ratio of the mass flow rate and the flow area, \n\nthe Mach number must be determined in order to compute the stagnation pressure, \n\nand can be calculated as the ratio between this velocity and the local speed of sound a: \n\n \n\n Ma\nv\n\na\n= ,  (3.10) \n\n \n\nwhich in turn can be calculated as: \n\n \n\n a RT?= ,  (3.11) \n\n \n\nwhere, as mentioned earlier, ? is the specific-heat ratio for air, R is the ideal gas \n\nconstant and T the temperature. \n\nAt this point the calculations to be performed are dimensioning procedures for \n\nthe perforated plate that must enable it to perform as intended for most foreseeable \n\nsituations. As far as its function is concerned, as the sensing element of an instrument \n\nthat is first and foremost a radiometer regardless of other possible features such as heat \n\nflux partitioning, this means that boundary layer blow-off must be ensured over a wide \n\nrange of conditions, including the less favourable.  \n\nGiven the instrument\u2019s intended function as a radiometer, care must be taken \n\nto ensure some certainty that the blow-off process is effective, and this can be achieved \n\nin several ways. The use of the relationship valid for laminar boundary layer on a \n\nstagnation plane flow provides the highest critical flow estimate for a given Reynolds \n\nnumber, while considering the density ?w at the porous wall to that of the compressed \n\nair flow that crosses the plate, although the actual value is smaller and could readily be \n\nestimated using well-established relationships for the pressure loss trough the \n\nperforated pattern and the related density variations [Kolodzie and Van Winkle 1957, \n\nFried and Idelchik 1989, Ishizuka et al. 2005]. \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\nConsidering the density ?w at the porous wall as being equal to that of the \n\ncompressed air flow that crosses the plate will lead to overestimated transpiration \n\nairflows and will actually increase the calculated critical mass flow for higher supply \n\npressures, which is obviously counterintuitive. This assumption is merely intended to \n\nensure boundary layer blow-off for any conditions and does not mean that such \n\noverestimated airflows will necessarily be used in normal operational conditions, where \n\nthe mass flow to be used will probably be considerably smaller.  \n\nMoreover, the nature of the airflow on the furnace side must also be taken into \n\naccount, since stagnation flows are not necessarily the most common in normal \n\nconditions, nor is their magnitude similar in terms of velocity to those used to compute \n\nthe maximum values to be handled by the perforated plate. Nevertheless, the capability \n\nto work in extreme conditions remains built into the system. \n\nThe critical transpiration mass flow will thus be a function of conditions on the \n\nside of the compressed air fed to the system, namely its pressure, temperature and \n\ngeometry (i.e. tubing diameters that influence mass flow), and conditions in the main \n\nstream such as the flow direction, velocity, temperature and pressure. While in some \n\napplications it may be assumed that the main stream is at atmospheric pressure, in \n\nothers, such as gas turbines, that assumption may not be valid. In this particular case, \n\ngiven the fact that the experimental work to be carried out would take place in a \n\nfurnace open to the atmosphere, the pressure was set at 1,013\u00d7105 Pa (i.e. 1 atm)  for \n\nall calculations and simulations, air density in the main stream being a function of \n\ntemperature. \n\nIn the case under discussion the flow will not be passed through a single duct \n\nbut rather though a pattern of small holes. This means that the microperforated plate \n\nmust be dimensioned in such a way that it enables the passage of the required mass \n\nflow even if conditions become sonic at the level of the small holes. The calculation of \n\nthe maximum mass flow permissible in the small holes can then be compared with the \n\ncritical transpiration gas mass flow in order to determine the minimum number of holes \n\nnecessary to accommodate the necessary gas flow, bearing in mind that a greater \n\nnumber of holes of the same diameter will diminish the mass flow through each of them \n\nby dividing the incoming total flow, so that a greater total flow can be circulated. \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \n\nIn terms of transpiration airflow handling, the perforated plate will thus be \n\nconsidered adequately dimensioned when the number of holes of a certain diameter is \n\nsufficient to accommodate the largest considered mass flow, which is in turn dictated \n\nby boundary layer blow-off requirements, and this maximum mass flow is ensured even \n\nif choked flow conditions are present in the perforated pattern. Other considerations \n\nthat have to do with the interaction between the perforated pattern and incoming \n\nradiation are addressed in detail later on. \n\nUnder the aforementioned assumptions, the critical transpiration mass flow    \n\n(in kgs-1) will increase with increasing density ?w at the porous wall, and will obviously \n\nbe higher for increasing main stream stagnation flow velocities, Equation 3.4 showing a \n\ndirect proportionality between the critical mass flow value and the stream velocity, \n\nthat is tempered by the inverse proportionality between the critical mass flow and the \n\nsquare root of the Reynolds number.  \n\nIt should be remembered that stagnation flows on the perforated plate are \n\nassumed and that reasonable velocities must be specified for these flows, which likewise \n\nrequire the definition of representative furnace temperatures, namely in order to \n\ncalculate air densities, viscosities and Reynolds numbers on the \u201chot\u201d side of the plate, \n\nassumed to be at one atmosphere in pressure as mentioned above. Conversely, while \n\nthe temperature of the incoming transpiration airflow can safely be assumed to be \n\nconstant at 25\u00baC, possible variations in pressure must be taken into account because \n\nthey do occur in practice and influence the density of the compressed air flow which, as \n\ndiscussed, will be considered equal to that of the air near the porous wall.   \n\nWith all these values, density ratios ? and critical mass fluxes and flows can be \n\ncalculated as described by Equations 3.2 and 3.4. Assumed furnace temperatures were \n\nconsidered in increments of 250\u00baC from 500 to 1500\u00baC, stagnation flow velocities were \n\nset at 1, 2, 5, 10 ms-1 and then in increments of 10 up to  50 ms-1, while the range of \n\nvalues considered for the compressed air pressure ranged from 2 to 8 bar, at 0.5 bar \n\nincrements. \n\nConsidering the aforementioned formulae and the assumptions listed above, the \n\nhighest critical mass fluxes naturally occur for the highest value of density ?w at the \n\nporous wall for each considered temperature, for the highest values of stagnation flow \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\nvelocities and for the highest temperatures considered in the furnaces, since these \n\nminimize the density ratio ? for any fixed supply pressure and therefore maximize the \n\ncritical mass flow, as illustrated in Figures 3.8 and 3.9. One of the interesting results \n\nfrom the numerical simulations of the perforated plate being crossed by varying gas \n\nmass flows, described in further detail below, is the conclusion that densities at the \n\nplate wall, averaged over its entire area since local variations result from the holes, can \n\nbe thirty times or more smaller than the density of the incoming compressed air flow, \n\nillustrating the large degree of overdimensioning present in these considerations.  \n\nThese critical mass flows are processed and fed from the compressed air system \n\nbut given the large pressure differences with the atmospheric pressure in the furnace \n\nthe possibility of choked flow in the holes of the microperforated pattern must be taken \n\ninto account. Equations 3.7 to 3.11 allow the calculation of the maximum mass flow \n\nthat can be accommodated by a hole of a certain diameter. The calculation of the \n\nchoked mass flows allows an analysis of the number of necessary holes of a certain \n\ndiameter, but other factors must be kept in mind, namely the need to ensure as \n\nuniform a flow as possible on the outer surface of the plate and the fact that the \n\nradiation transmissivity of the plate is a direct function of the perforated and non-\n\nperforated areas of the plate, as discussed below.  \n\nFor small hole diameters the choked flow value will naturally be very low, so \n\nthe criterion selected for dimensioning the perforated plate was to study the number of \n\nholes of a certain diameter necessary to accommodate the highest critical mass flow \n\nrate encountered in the previous step of the process, this value occurring for a \n\nstagnation velocity of 50 ms-1 and for the maximum density considered at the porous \n\nwall, that is the density corresponding to the compressed air flow at 8 bar for each of \n\nthe temperatures of interest. As mentioned earlier, the assumption of such values does \n\nnot mean that such overestimated airflows will necessarily be used in normal \n\noperational conditions, where the mass flow to be used will probably be considerably \n\nsmaller and relatively small mass flows will ensure boundary layer blow-off. \n\nOnce values for both the critical transpiration mass flows necessary to ensure \n\nboundary layer blow-off and the mass flow that can be passed in a given hole at choked \n\nflow conditions are available, the number of necessary holes can be thought of as \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\nmerely the ratio between the critical mass flow and the choked flow in each hole of the \n\npattern, since it is assumed that all the incoming compressed air is passed through the \n\nperforated pattern, although this may not be the case if a faulty welding process is \n\napplied to the edge of the plates when they are attached to the porous holder. These \n\nareas are obviously not only a function of the number of holes and their number but \n\nalso of their spacing, so that the numbers of holes obtained here must be considered \n\nalong with the intended values for plate transmissivity. Furthermore, the ability to \n\naccommodate the necessary number of holes with a specified spacing on a plate with a \n\npre-determined diameter and therefore frontal area must obviously checked, ensured \n\nand adjusted if necessary. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 \u2013 Critical mass flows as a function of the assumed densities at the porous wall and \n\nfurnaces temperatures, for the maximum stagnation velocity. \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.0005\n\n0.001\n\n0.0015\n\n0.002\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nC\nri\nti\nca\nl \nm\na\nss\n f\nlo\nw\n [\nk\ng\ns-\n1\n]\n\nAir density at porous wall [kgm-3]\n\n523 K\n\n773 K\n\n1023 K\n\n1273 K\n\n1523 K\n\n1773 K\n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 \u2013 Critical mass flows as a function of the assumed densities at the porous wall and \n\nstagnation flow velocities, for the maximum densities at the porous wall. \n\n \n\nChoked flows in the holes are determined from Equation 3.7, which requires a \n\nknowledge of conditions upstream of the plate in terms of temperature, pressure and \n\nflow velocity, so that Mach number and stagnation temperatures and pressures, can be \n\ncalculated using Equations 3.8 to 3.11. Pressures and temperatures are the same as \n\nconsidered before, while flow velocities and Mach numbers upstream of the plate are \n\ncalculated considering the feed line diameter and from the maximum critical mass flow \n\nat each temperature, that is the critical value occurring for the highest density at the \n\nporous plate and highest stagnation external flow, as mentioned above. \n\nOnce these values are available, the necessary number of holes in the pattern \n\ncan be calculated as the ratio between the maximum critical mass flow to be \n\naccommodated at a given temperature and the choked mass flow for a specified hole \n\ndiameter, as listed in Table 3.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.0005\n\n0.001\n\n0.0015\n\n0.002\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nC\nri\nti\nca\nl \nm\na\nss\n f\nlo\nw\n [\nk\ng\ns-\n1\n]\n\nStagnation flow velocity [ms-1]\n\n523 K\n\n773 K\n\n1023 K\n\n1273 K\n\n1523 K\n\n1773 K\n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Critical mass flow to choked flow ratios, indicative of the number of holes. \n\nd* [mm] \nCritical mass flow to choked flow ratios \n\n523 K 773 K 1023 K 1273 K 1523 K 1773 K \n\n0.005 194.22 270.72 343.53 413.68 481.78 548.22 \n\n0.1 48.56 67.68 85.88 103.42 120.45 137.06 \n\n0.5 1.94 2.71 3.44 4.14 4.82 5.48 \n\n1 0.49 0.68 0.86 1.03 1.20 1.37 \n\n \n\nFrom the values in Table 3.1 it is visible that a single 1 mm hole would be able to \n\naccommodate almost any possible critical mass flow under discussion, while for the \n\nintended hole diameter of 0.1 mm the number of necessary holes to handle the \n\nmaximum critical mass flow is merely 138. If all 138 holes were placed tangent to each \n\nother along the diameter of the plate, a total diameter of 13.8 mm would be obtained, \n\nwhich proves that it is a simple matter to place the necessary number of holes in the \n\nspecified plate diameter. Additionally, other considerations regarding the specification \n\nof the perforation pattern parameters have more to do with plate transmissivity and \n\nflow uniformity issues rather than with boundary layer blow-off and compressibility \n\nproblems in the holes leading to insufficient transpiration mass flows. This also means \n\nthat the number of holes calculated from plate transmissivity and flow uniformity \n\ncriteria will lead to a safely overdimensioned number of holes as far as transpiration \n\nrequirements as concerned. \n\nAs mentioned earlier mass flows are heavily overestimated merely for \n\ndimensioning purposes, and actual operational mass flows are expected to be much \n\nsmaller, but another related matter should be kept in mind. \n\n The use of comparatively high transpiration mass flows is fundamental from the \n\npoint of view of the measurement principle and the analytical approaches discussed in \n\nthe previous chapter, since these large airflows are the only way of achieving the low \n\nsurface temperatures that enable the assumption of a negligible emission component in \n\nthe radiative balance between the plate\u2019s surface and the hot surroundings encountered, \n\nfor instance, in furnaces.  \n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\nGiven the fact that the aforementioned CTG airflows are largely \n\noverdimensioned, the operational use of similar values will ensure both the intended \n\nboundary layer blow-off and the low surface temperatures. As discussed in Chapter 4, \n\nthe maximum mass flows achievable in a measurable manner (i.e. using mass flow \n\nmeters rather than simply connecting compressed air lines at the maximum pressure \n\nsetting) in the laboratories where the experimental studies took place are indeed similar \n\nin magnitude to the maximum values discussed above, although slightly smaller but \n\ncertainly sufficient to ensure both intended objectives.  \n\nAnother interesting effect to be considered is a lessening of the importance of \n\nthe external refrigeration system. The contact area between the porous medium and the \n\nrim of the plate was maximized to a reasonable extent without leading to unduly large \n\ndiameters atop the instrument, nevertheless remaining rather small. The bulk of the \n\nplate\u2019s refrigeration needs, if only for radiative emission minimization, will undoubtedly \n\nbe met by the transpiration airflow given its magnitude and its direct contact with a \n\nmassive portion of the plate\u2019s mass and volume. This also means that the fail-safe \n\nposition of the valves controlling the transpiration airflow must be such that the \n\nairflow is on in the absence of control signal in the valve, which must thus be a \n\nnormally-open valve. \n\n3.3.3 Plate Transmissivity \n\nBesides boundary layer control and compressibility issues, other considerations must be \n\nmade regarding the use of the microperforated plate, since the presence of the pattern \n\nof holes has other implications.  \n\nWhile the option of using a thin perforated plate rather than a comparatively \n\nthick sinterized porous cylinder as the sensing element is rather naturally intuitive from \n\nthe strict point of view of its thermal inertia, it does entail a need to carefully consider \n\nsome factors that could otherwise be ignored. Especially relevant is the issue of the \n\nelement\u2019s transmissivity, since the combination of the low thickness and the perforated \n\npattern renders it non-opaque, such an effect being visible (although at a different \n\nwavelength than the ones at which the element is expected to perform) even when such \n\nthe plate is held at arm\u2019s length. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\nThe behaviour of a solid element exposed to incident radiation is a complex \n\nphenomenon even in cases when no perforation is present, since solids can exhibit \n\nvarious degrees of emissivity, reflectivity and transmittance that can be characterized \n\nwith varying levels of accuracy and complexity. The problem is compounded by the \n\npresence of any degree of porosity that implies some convection and alters the radiative \n\nand conductive behaviours. This additional complexity should be taken into account \n\neven in cases when no perforation is apparent through the whole thickness of the \n\nelement, since phenomena such as internal reflection, reemission and scattering can \n\noccur within the cavities of the porous medium and the interfaces between phases. \n\nThere are numerous references that deal with various aspects of porous media, \n\nincluding their thermal behaviour, and increasingly with media with very small (i.e. \n\nnanoscale) and ordered porosities [Wehrspohn 2005]. Of interest within the framework \n\nof the present work is also the existence of transient effects of radiative transfer in \n\nsemitransparent materials [Siegel 1998]. \n\nAn accurate evaluation of the medium\u2019s thermal behaviour is of critical \n\nimportance for its use as a sensing element but such an analysis is potentially difficult \n\ndue to the aforementioned internal reflection, reemission and scattering phenomena. \n\nThese are potentially very difficult to analyse. Thus, a variety of techniques are \n\navailable in order to simplify the task, often involving the determination of a single \n\neffective thermal conductivity for the simpler case of a single solid material and only \n\none gas. Some involve detailed calculations of radiative balances within the cavities \n\n[Tsai and Strieder 1986] but most are based on averaging techniques that treat the \n\nhighly heterogeneous phases (each of which can be either opaque, transparent or semi-\n\ntransparent) as one or several homogeneous materials [Travkin and Catton 2001], \n\nrelying on known morphology data and yielding average values for the various \n\nmaterials, that enable much simpler heat transfer calculations. \n\n The thin perforated plate is a very particular case of porous medium, for several \n\nreasons, and is fortunately a much simpler situation than those mentioned above. In all \n\nrelevant situations but especially given the plate\u2019s low thickness and the related small \n\ndiameter and spacing of the microperforated patterns, special care must be applied \n\nwhen studying periodic structures exposed to electromagnetic radiation, due to the \n\npossible occurrence of unforeseen and usually unfamiliar phenomena, such as the \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nphenomenon of greatly enhanced transmission of light through a subwavelength \n\naperture in an otherwise opaque metallic film patterned with a regularly repeating \n\nperiodic structure, such as the microperforation under discussion.  \n\nThis phenomenon is designated as Extraordinary Optical Transmission (EOT). \n\nWhen light of a certain wavelength falls on a subwavelength aperture, it is diffracted \n\nisotropically and evenly in all directions, with minimal far-field transmission. This is \n\nthe understanding from classical aperture theory as first described [Bethe 1944] and \n\nlater corrected [Bouwkamp 1950]. In EOT however, the regularly repeating structure \n\nenables a much higher transmission efficiency to occur, up to several orders of \n\nmagnitude higher than that predicted by classical aperture theory [Ebbesen et al. 1998, \n\nMart\u00edn-Moreno et al. 2001], this effect being widely studied and exploited when such \n\namplifications are sought [Chao-Chun 1973, Letrou and Gheudin 1992, Green and Yi \n\n2004, Canpean and Astilean 2009]. \n\nIt is therefore necessary to make sure that no such effects are to be expected \n\nwhen defining the microperforated pattern that is intended to interact with incoming \n\nthermal radiation. The latter is usually defined as the emission of electromagnetic \n\nwaves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero. Moreover, in \n\nthe scope of this document it is conventionally defined as ranging from about 0.1 \u00b5m to \n\nseveral hundred microns, covering the infrared, visible and near-ultraviolet portions of \n\nthe electromagnetic spectrum. \n\nThe sensor prototype will be tested in a blackbody furnace which can be set to \n\ntemperatures up to 1500\u00b0C. Thus, in order to verify whether EOT phenomena can be \n\nexpected, the wavelength range of the radiation produced in the furnace must be \n\ndetermined. \n\nAccording to Wien\u2019s displacement law, there is an inverse relationship between \n\nthe wavelength of the peak of the emission of a black body and its temperature when \n\nexpressed as a function of the wavelength, that is: \n\n \n\n \nmax 3\n\nT C? = ,  (3.12) \n\n \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\nwhere C3 = 2897.8  K\u00b5m. This means that if furnace temperatures from 750 to 1500\u00b0C \n\nare considered, emission maxima will range from 2.83 to 1.63 \u00b5m, while spectral \n\nemissive power as a function of temperature and wavelength can be calculated using \n\nPlanck\u2019s distribution: \n\n \n\n ( )\n( ) ( )\n\n2\n0 1\n\n, 5 5\n0 2\n\n2\n,\n\nexp 1 exp 1\nb\n\nhc C\nE b\n\nhc kT C T\n?\n?\n\n? ? ? ?\n= =\n\n? ? ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n\n  (3.13) \n\n \n\nwhere h and k are the universal Planck and Boltzmann constants respectively, c0 is the \n\nspeed of light in vacuum and with C1=3.742\u00d710\n8 W\u00b5m4m-2 and C2=1.439\u00d710\n\n4 K\u00b5m, as \n\nillustrated in Figure 3.10. \n\nAs discussed earlier the envisaged plate thickness values for the present \n\napplication were around 0.1 mm, with limitations on hole diameter to plate thickness \n\nratios imposed by the manufacturing processes. Given the results in Table 3.1, it is \n\nvisible that the avoidance of EOT phenomena in subwavelength apertures is \n\nstraightforward, since hole diameters are significantly larger than incoming radiation \n\nwavelengths. The wavelength band where 80% of emitted radiation at the considered \n\ntemperatures occurs (i.e. excluding the lower and upper 10% of the total range) can \n\nalso be calculated using the blackbody radiation functions, as summarized in Table 3.2. \n\nThe hole diameter-to-plate thickness ratio limitation must be combined with the \n\ngeometric analysis of the transmissivity in order to establish proper dimensions for the \n\nmicroperforated pattern to be obtained, bearing in mind the fact that transmissivity \n\nshould be kept as low as possible when other radiative heat exchange parameters such \n\nas absorption and reflection are constant, in order to maximize the amount of heat \n\nabsorbed by the plate and transformed into a measurable temperature increase for \n\ntransient analysis. \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 \u2013 Spectral emissive power as a function of temperature and wavelength. \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Emitted radiation parameters \n\nTemperature [K] Emission Maximum [\u00b5m] 80% Range [\u00b5m] \n\n523 5.54 14.23 \n\n773 3.75 9.63 \n\n1023 2.83 7.28 \n\n1273 2.28 5.85 \n\n1523 1.90 4.89 \n\n1773 1.63 4.20 \n\n \n\nTransmission phenomena through solids with periodic apertures can be of very \n\ncomplex description and are especially studied in the range of frequencies relevant for \n\nradio and microwave applications.

For normal incidence \n\nthe power transmittance is the geometrical ratio of opening to blockage, that is \n\n[Winnewisser et al. 1998]: \n\n \n\n \nrad\n\nOpening\nBlockage\n\n?\n?\n= .  (3.14) \n\n \n\nOpening and blockage areas will depend upon which particular unit cells are \n\nconsidered and these, in turn, are a function of the perforation parameters, the most \n\nusual perforated pattern using circular holes being the 60\u00ba staggered pattern used here. \n\nUnit cell parameters, namely hole diameters and their spacings that dictate opening \n\nand blockage areas are summarized in Table 3.3. \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 \u2013 Unit Cell Parameters \n\nUnit Cell \n\n \n\nOpening \n2\n\n8\nd?\n\n  \n\nBlockage \n2 2\n\nsin(60)\n2 8\ne d?\n\n?  \n\n \n\nwhere e is the distance between holes and d is their diameter. The selection of a 60\u00ba \n\nstaggered pattern over a square pattern was already discussed in Chapter 2 and has to \n\ndo with guaranteeing an isotropic distribution in the plane of the plate, as opposed to \n\nthe orthotropic behaviour of a square pattern [Dowling 1999]. \n\nA variety of perforated patterns is thus defined in terms of hole diameter and \n\nspacing, and the resulting transmissivity can then be plotted as summarized in     \n\nTable 3.4 and illustrated in Figure 3.11. The aforementioned limitations in the hole \n\ndiameter-to-plate thickness must be remembered at this point, along with the selection \n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\nof a 0.1 mm thickness for the plate. This means that the hole diameter was set at the \n\nsame value so that the transmissivity plot only takes into account this diameter and \n\nvarious hole spacings e. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 \u2013 Plate transmissivity as a function of the hole diameter to spacing ratio of the \n\nperforated pattern. \n\n \n\nA maximum acceptable transmissivity value was arbitrarily set at 20%. If a hole \n\n0.1 mm in diameter is considered, a spacing of 0.233 mm between holes ensures the \n\nintended transmissivity, so that the final spacing was specified as 0.25 mm for a \n\ntransmissivity of 17%, leading to the configuration illustrated in Fig. 3.1. \n\n3.3.4 Cooling System \n\nAs mentioned earlier the relative importance of the external refrigeration system is \n\nlessened by the magnitude of the transpiration airflow and its cooling effect on the \n\nplate, given the airflow\u2019s direct contact with the bulk of the material of which the plate \n\nis made of and the admittedly rather small contact area between the porous medium \n\nand the rim of the plate. \n\nThe porous component is nevertheless important, if only as a means of \n\ncontaining, directing and ultimately handling the transpiration airflow. This function \n\ncould arguably have been performed by a solid component. Temperatures could be \n\nminimized if the metal mass exposed to high heat fluxes was kept low by using small \n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\nT\nra\nn\nsm\n\nis\nsi\nv\nit\ny\n \n\ne /d\n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\nouter tubing diameters, but this could be problematic from the strict point of view of \n\nsystem robustness. As mentioned earlier, the minimization of dimensions and the \n\nlessening of the thermal inertia of the overall system were never intended to be \n\nobtained at the expense of robustness, which meant that wall thicknesses of at least     \n\n1 mm had to be used for safety. \n\nThe idea of rendering the plate holder porous can be thought of merely as an \n\nadditional benefit in terms of component safety in avoiding excessive temperatures by \n\nmaking use of this comparatively large wall thickness, and therefore volume, as a heat \n\ntransfer surface. \n\nThe porous steel casing is thus intended to serve as a holder for the \n\nmicroperforated plate with some refrigeration around its outer diameter, the plate being \n\nwelded to the top of the porous holder. The intention is to make use of the large \n\nspecific area (defined as the ratio between the surface area available for heat transfer \n\nand the volume) of the porous parts to interact with a stream of cooling air. \n\nAn analytical description of heat transfer within a porous medium can be \n\ndifficult to describe if some assumptions are not made in order to simplify the \n\napproach. It is indeed a field of study in its own right, with large numbers of articles \n\nbeing published every year and relevant studies being continuously carried out, so \n\nmuch that even well-established academic manuals have been in need of constant \n\nupdating to take into account new analytical approaches, new porous medium \n\nmorphologies such as metal foams (rather than the more conventional packed solid \n\nspheres) or the large number of empirical correlation for relevant parameters such as \n\nNusselt numbers or convection coefficients that have been emerging [Kaviany 1995, \n\nVafai 2005]. \n\nThe one-equation equilibrium or the two-equation non-equilibrium models are \n\ncommonly used. The first model assumes that there is no temperature difference \n\nbetween the local fluid and solid phase while the second model treats the fluid and solid \n\nseparately, considering the local temperature difference between them. The latter is \n\nmore difficult to apply because it requires information on the interfacial heat transfer \n\ncoefficient, which is usually determined through a large number of experimental \n\ninvestigations [Kim 1993]. Owing to this difficulty, some investigators have used the \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \n\none-equation model for the analysis of convection heat transfer in a general porous \n\nmedium. However, the one-equation model is only valid when the local temperature \n\ndifference between fluid and solid is negligibly small. This will not be the case in heat \n\nexchanger applications where the difference in the thermal conductivities of the fluid \n\nand solid is significant and certainly not the case as far as the microperforated plate \n\nand the transpiration airflow are concerned, since no significant heating of the air \n\nflowing through the microperforated pattern is to be expected. \n\nThe most widely available models are for spherical media, that is materials \n\nwhere the porosity consists of the empty spaces between packed solid spheres. Other \n\nconfigurations are somewhat less well established and a large part of current work in \n\nthe field focuses on other morphologies, such as spherical pores or open-cell metal foams \n\n[Boomsma et al. 2003]. \n\n Given the fact that the cooling system is a somewhat secondary component of \n\nthe system in terms of the measurement process itself and that a proper analytical \n\napproach would for that reason be outside the main focus of the work described here, \n\nthe emphasis was put merely on an adequate determination of its performance rather \n\nthan on a comprehensive analytical formulation, commercial CFD software being used \n\nfor the purpose, namely the CFX module of ANSYS 13. \n\nAs discussed in Chapter 4, the porous components that were eventually ordered \n\nconsisted of porous steel with spherical pores. This required the definition of several \n\nparameters necessary to the simulation, especially as far as the porous medium \n\nmorphology was concerned, namely its volume porosity and its interfacial area density. \n\nIt was assumed that different porosity grades represented equally sized spherical voids \n\nof diameter dp, the other important parameter being porosity, which can change for \n\ndifferent types of packing and is a sufficient parameter to characterize the \u201cpacking\u201d of \n\nthe hollow spheres. The free volume Vvoid can be found from the number of pores and \n\nthe volume of a single pore, Vvoid=NVp. Defining porosity ? as the ratio of free to total \n\nvolumes: \n\n \n\n void\n\ntot\n\nV\n\nV\n? =   (3.15) \n\n \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\nand the volume of a single spherical void Vp, the number of voids per volume can be \n\ncalculated as: \n\n \n\n p\n\ntot\n\nNV\n\nV\n? = .  (3.16) \n\n \n\nThe number of voids per unit volume nV is expressed as: \n\n \n\n \nV\n\ntot p\n\nN\nn\n\nV V\n\n?\n= = .  (3.17) \n\n \n\nThe specific interfacial surface area between the voids and the air can be defined \n\nas: \n\n \n\n p\np\n\ntot\n\nNA\na\n\nV\n= ,  (3.18) \n\n \n\nwith Ap being the surface area of a single spherical void, the SI unit of the specific area \n\nbeing m2/m3 or m-1. It then follows that: \n\n \n\n p\np\n\np\n\nA\na\n\nV\n?= ,  (3.19) \n\n \n\nwhere Ap/Vp is the specific surface area of a single void. The surface area-to-volume \n\nratio can be calculated for every object and this ratio is the smallest for a sphere. This \n\nmeans that the interfacial area calculation used here is underestimating the real area of \n\nnon-ideal voids: \n\n \n\n \n\n2\n\np\n\np\n\n3\np p\n\np\n\n4\n2 6\n\n4\n3 2\n\nd\n\nA\n\nV dd\n\n?\n\n?\n\n? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?\n= =\n\n? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?\n\n, (3.20) \n\n\n\n142 \n\n \n\nand finally: \n\n \n\n \np\n\np\n\n6\na\n\nd\n?= .  (3.21) \n\n \n\nAs mentioned when the construction of prototypes is discussed, the parts were \n\nmade using sintered steel with 25% porosity consisting of interconnected pores \n\naveraging 7 \u00b5m in diameter dispersed throughout the material, thermal conductivity \n\nbeing similar to a 400-Series stainless steel for the solid matrix. These pore diameters, \n\nvolume porosities and part total volumes led to an interfacial area density of about \n\n2.14\u00d7105 m-1, but it should be noted that the aforementioned grossly underestimates \n\ninterfacial area due to the fact that the assumption of uniform and spherical pores is \n\noverly simplified. A look at the SEM (Scanning Electronic Microscopy) image \n\nillustrated in Figure 3.12 clearly shows that the voids are very irregular and have a \n\nlarge variation in volume in any such materials. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 \u2013 SEM image of the irregularity in void geometry and the significant variations in \n\ntheir volume (image courtesy of Applied Porous Technologies AB). \n\n \n\nAnother parameter was necessary in order to run the simulations, namely the \n\nheat transfer coefficient between the fluid and solid phases. Setting this value is \n\nnotoriously difficult given the complexity of the matter, and the large number of \n\nnumerical and experimental studies published in recent years on this specific topic has \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\nto do with the determination of adequate correlations for particular porous \n\nmorphologies, materials, fluids and component geometries, in this context especially as \n\nfar as Nusselt numbers or Reynolds numbers based on Darcian flow velocities that are \n\nstrongly dependant of the listed variables [Boomsma et al. 2003]. Given the relative \n\nimportance of the porous medium in the overall performance of the system, at least \n\nwhen compared with the behaviour of the transpiration airflow interacting with the \n\nperforated plate, temperatures at the interface between the plate and the porous \n\nmedium were evaluated by carrying out parametric studies in order to evaluate the \n\nvariations that this parameter can have, rather than developing an approach with the \n\nsame level of analytical detail as used for instance in the evaluation of critical \n\ntranspiration flows or the interaction between incoming radiation and the perforated \n\npattern. The CFD simulations where the relationships above were put into used will be \n\ndescribed in the next section \n\nOnce the design principles stated above are used to determine some of the most \n\nimportant geometrical and dimensional features of the sensing element and to evaluate \n\nsuch important operational parameters as the transpiration airflows, the performance of \n\nthe system as a whole must be studied, especially as far as the temperatures reached \n\nwithin the system for different incident radiation and transpiration airflow levels, as \n\nwell as their variations in time, are concerned. \n\n3.4 Parametric Studies \n\nThe main parametric studies conducted using ANSYS CFX have to do with the central \n\nprinciple underlying the instrument under discussion, namely the correlation between \n\nthe temperature measured by a thermocouple attached to the centre of the \n\nmicroperforated plate that serves as a sensing element, and the various incident heat \n\nfluxes and transpiration airflows to which the element is exposed, the latter being \n\neither a radiative heat flux if the transpiration mass flow is supercritical or otherwise a \n\nconvective and radiative total heat flux. The various dimensioning procedures were \n\ndiscussed above, and the parametric studies to be conducted using CFX allow to some \n\nextent an evaluation of their adequacy as far as the instrument\u2019s overall thermal \n\nperformance is concerned, especially regarding magnitude and time variation of the \n\ntemperatures to be measured by the thermocouple. The reasonability of various \n\n\n\n144 \n\n \n\nassumptions made in the development of the analytical model, for example ignoring the \n\nsurface radiative emission term in the heat flux balance with hot surroundings, can also \n\nbe validated in the numerical studies, since this emission term can be discounted if \n\nsurface temperatures are comparatively low, as can be verified form the simulation \n\nresults. \n\nBesides the validation of design options and dimensioning procedures, the \n\nquestion of determining which operational conditions are most adequate must be kept \n\nin mind and discussed in terms of transpiration and refrigeration airflows and their \n\nimpact on measurements. The fact that measured temperatures result from the balance \n\nbetween incident radiation and the cooling effect of various transpiration mass flows is \n\nespecially relevant both in the context of operational conditions and in the verification \n\nof the assumption that the radiative emission from the plate is to be discounted.  \n\nThe transient behaviour implied by the pulsed operation principle must also be \n\nadequately described for the various expected changes in incident heat fluxes and \n\ntranspiration airflow. Of critical importance is the determination of acceptable limits to \n\nthe thermocouple temperature when the transpiration airflow is significantly reduced or \n\neven switched off, in order to define adequate times for the induced pulsed behaviour. \n\nCentral to characterizing the instrument\u2019s performance is the relationship \n\nbetween the measured temperature (or the slope of its time variation curve), the \n\nincident heat flux and the various transpiration airflows. In order to proceed with such \n\nstudies, some preparation is necessary in setting up the simulations. \n\nThe basic configuration of the system has already been established and \n\ndiscussed, and the process of obtaining adequate CAD models for importation onto \n\nCFX was straightforward. However, the large difference in size between features of the \n\nmodels could be troublesome because of implications in terms of specifying an adequate \n\ncomputational mesh. An example is the transition from the very fine mesh necessary to \n\nadequately represent each hole in the perforated pattern, which requires several \n\nelements on the perimeter of hundreds of holes 0.1 mm in diameter, to the mesh \n\nlocated in the air of fluid domains located on either side of the plate and that extend \n\nfor several centimetres.  \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2, all simulations and calculations were carried out on \n\na computer equipped with an Intel Core i7 processor at 2.93 GHz clock frequency and  \n\n4 MB of RAM, on a Windows 7 64-bit operating system. As usual in applications of the \n\nkind, potential computational limitations arising from stringent mesh requirements can \n\nbe alleviated by the possibility of making use of symmetries occurring in the system. In \n\nthis particular case the overall geometry of the system consists of components with \n\ncylindrical components symmetrical in the angular direction, while at the level of the \n\nmicroperforated plate the pattern has an angular periodicity of 60\u00ba, as discussed above. \n\nThis led to the specification of a geometry consisting of an angular sector of 60\u00ba with \n\nrotational symmetry boundary conditions specified on either side, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.13. \n\nAs a standard procedure in numerical studies, mesh independence was \n\nattempted by evaluating changes in the temperature at the centre of the sensing \n\nelement between successive refinements and stopping the refinement process when no \n\nsignificant changes occurred. Although differences in the monitored variable were \n\nalready low (&lt;5%), this process could not be continued due to a lack of memory in the \n\nsystem that caused the meshing program to exceed its limits in terms of memory \n\nallocation handling. Thus, the meshes used were the most refined usable ones resulting \n\nfrom this refinement process.  \n\nFigure 3.13a illustrates the solid component of the computational domain (in \n\nblue), with the limits of the fluid domain shown in wireframe. The rotational symmetry \n\nabout the z-axis is readily apparent and the 60\u00ba section of the perforated plate is shown \n\nplaced on top of the cone, with its outer section overhanging it. This surface will be set \n\nas an imposed temperature boundary condition, since it corresponds to the surface of \n\nthe porous holder where the plate will be attached. \n\nSymmetry and mass continuity require the specification of only one-sixth of the \n\nintended overall mass flow entering the inlet at the bottom at a specified pressure and \n\ntemperature, while the upper part of the fluid domain is defined as an opening at \n\natmospheric pressure and a set value of external blackbody temperature. The latter is \n\ndefined as the effective blackbody temperature of any bodies beyond the boundary, \n\nwhich is exactly how the calibration furnace surfaces are intended to be represented. \n\n\n\n146 \n\n \n\nBesides this external blackbody temperature the software also requires a local fluid \n\ntemperature to be defined at the location of the boundary.  \n\nSimulations were conducted in order to find out if the earlier assumption of \n\nsmall values of heating for the overall airflow crossing the perforated plate under \n\ntypical furnace temperatures and transpiration mass flows was valid, as was found to \n\nbe the case. This meant that the airflow was considered to be entering the domain at \n\n298 K (i.e. 25\u00baC) and the local fluid temperature at the opening was set at 300 K for \n\nmost simulated situations. The only exception was the simulation of situations where \n\nthe transpiration airflow is cut and the steady-state response of the sensor to \n\nconvection and radiation was sought, in which case the local fluid temperature was \n\nconservatively set at the same value as the external blackbody temperature. The \n\nintended transient operation mode means that such situations will not be encountered \n\nin practice but temperatures potentially reached in those cases were nevertheless \n\nstudied as an indication of extreme bounds for thermal levels although, as will be \n\ndiscussed in the following chapter, the situation of gas temperatures reaching the same \n\nvalues as those of the furnace surfaces is unrealistic. \n\nIn this chapter the opening temperatures were set assuming a unitary \n\nemissivity, which is obviously not the case in the situations encountered in the \n\nexperimental studies. Necessary adjustments to this parameter for comparison purposes \n\nwill be discussed later in this text. \n\nFigure 3.13b shows the type of imposed boundary conditions, while Figure 3.14 \n\nis a close-up view of the mesh at the level of the perforated pattern. Note that this \n\nconfiguration does not model the interaction of the refrigeration airflow with the porous \n\nmedium. The integration of this factor into the simulation would require a less refined \n\nmesh to run due to system limitations encountered in the aforementioned refinement \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 3.13 \u2013 60\u00ba unit cell geometry symmetry (a) and opening (blue), inlet (black), symmetry \n\n(red) and wall (green) boundary conditions (b). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the presence of a swirling component in the refrigeration airflow, \n\ninjected tangentially in the non-porous casing base and intended to augment its \n\nresidence time in the space between the solid cone and the porous holder, invalidates \n\nthe use of the 60\u00ba symmetry. So, the refrigeration airflow and its interaction with the \n\nporous medium needs to be addressed in a different model. Moreover, this other model \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 \u2013 Close-up view of the perforated pattern mesh. \n\n\n\n148 \n\n \n\nwill provide simulated values for the temperatures achieved at the surface where the \n\nperforated plate will be attached to the porous holder, which only emphasises its \n\nimportance even if, as discussed below, the essential contribution in terms of system \n\nrefrigeration comes without surprise from the transpiration airflow. \n\nThe basic configuration of the model for studying the interaction of the \n\nrefrigeration airflow with the porous medium is illustrated in Figure 3.15, where the \n\ntangential injection of the refrigeration airflow that provides the swirl component is \n\nvisible. Both the transpiration and the refrigeration airflows can be seen in the form of \n\nstreamlines, together with a plane showing the temperature distribution in the cone, \n\nthe non-porous base and the porous holder. It should be noted how some of the \n\nstreamlines actually cross the porous component. Results and implementation details of \n\nthis model will be discussed further below. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15 \u2013 Basic configuration of the model studying the porous medium interacting with the \n\nrefrigeration airflow. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\nNote that the microperforated pattern is not simulated in this model and \n\nunderstandably so considering the limitations encountered in simulating even one sixth \n\nof the perforated plate, as discussed above. This does not mean that this model does \n\nnot consider the presence of the plate, but merely that the component was modelled as \n\na porous medium for which an interfacial contact area between solid and fluid phases \n\nwas calculated. This is a very straightforward process given the very well-ordered \n\ngeometry of the perforated plate, where areas and volumes are easily calculated as \n\ndiscussed in the previous chapter, and heat transfer coefficients can likewise be \n\ncalculated. \n\n3.4.1 Variations of Plate Temperatures with Incident Heat Fluxes \n\nThe basic configuration illustrated in Figures 3.13 and 3.14 allows the simulation of a \n\nvariety of situations. Of central interest within the framework under discussion is \n\nobviously the thermal response at the location where the thermocouple will be attached \n\nto the plate, that is, at its centre. This response must be evaluated as a function of a \n\ncombination of incident heat fluxes and transpiration mass flows, but in order to \n\nunderstand the underlying influence of each of these factors their influence was studied \n\nseparately, starting with a parametric study of the effect of incident heat fluxes. \n\nThese heat fluxes are ultimately the result of placing the system in a furnace \n\nthat for the moment will be assumed to have a unitary emissivity, although this is not \n\nnecessarily the case in practice, as will be discussed later. This means that heat flux \n\ncoming from the cavity defined by the surrounding furnace walls is assumed to \n\ncorrespond to the emissive behaviour of a blackbody, where the spectral emissive power \n\nof Equation 3.13 is integrated over the entire wavelength spectrum to give the \n\nblackbody total emissive power: \n\n \n\n 4\nb\n\nE T?= ,  (3.22) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This means that the system must be able to \n\ncope with thermal conditions that become comparatively more stringent as the \n\ntemperature of the surroundings increases, leading to a need for strong refrigeration \n\n\n\n150 \n\n \n\nrequirements in order to keep superficial plate temperatures sufficiently low to allow a \n\ndiscounting of the emission component.  \n\nSince a significant amount of the plate refrigeration is provided by the \n\ntranspiration airflow, this will lead to the use of comparatively high mass flows, as \n\ndiscussed below, but requires a study of the behaviour of plate temperatures under \n\ndifferent incident heat fluxes for any given transpiration mass flow. \n\nA variety of simulations was carried out by setting increasing values of furnace \n\ntemperature for a range of transpiration mass flows, but in order to study the influence \n\nof the received radiation on the plate temperatures, a given mass flow must be set. A \n\nfixed outer refrigeration temperature was assumed for the moment at 200\u00baC, although a \n\nmore detailed study of this parameter will be performed and discussed later in the \n\nchapter when simulations or the porous medium are analyzed. \n\nSome of the assumptions made during the discussion of the analytical models in \n\nthe previous chapter and the dimensioning procedures discussed above were verified, \n\nnamely the very small temperature gradients across the plate\u2019s thickness and the \n\navoidance of choked flow conditions in the range of transpiration mass flows used in the \n\nsimulations. The fact that these temperatures are also influenced by the sensing \n\nelement\u2019s emissivity must also be kept in mind, so a parametric study for this variable \n\nis also desirable. Shown in Figure 3.16 are the results of simulations at a fixed \n\ntranspiration mass flow (1\u00d710-3 kgs-1) for increasing radiation source temperatures, with \n\nthree different plate emissivities. \n\nFor the higher furnace temperatures, large differences in measured plate \n\ntemperatures are apparent, which renders a precise determination of this parameter \n\nespecially important. \n\n\n\n151 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 \u2013 Plate temperatures as a function of furnace temperature and plate emissivity. \n\n \n\nThe aforementioned plate temperatures are also especially relevant regarding \n\nthe underlying assumption that the emission component of the radiative balance \n\nbetween the plate and its hot surroundings can de ignored. Surface temperatures must \n\nbe kept to low values (e.g. smaller than 100\u00baC) in order not to invalidate this \n\nassumption. This in turn requires adequate plate cooling if the instrument is to work at \n\nhigh furnace temperatures, and most of the cooling will be provided by the \n\ntranspiration airflow, as discussed in the next section. In any case, for low surroundings \n\ntemperatures the radiative balance may not allow the convenient assumption of a non-\n\nsignificant emissive component for the plate. Consequently, if a model that relies on \n\nsuch an assumption is to be comfortably used, high surroundings temperatures must be \n\nassumed. \n\n3.4.2 Variations of Plate Temperatures with Transpiration Mass \n\nFlows \n\nIn a similar fashion to the simulations discussed before for the variations of plate \n\ntemperatures with various incoming heat fluxes caused by blackbodies at various \n\ntemperatures, simulations of the thermal behaviour of the plates can also be set up in \n\norder to study the influence of increasing mass flows, for a given heat source \n\ntemperature. Such a study is especially relevant in order to evaluate the mass flows \n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\n750 950 1150 1350 1550 1750\n\nM\ne\na\nsu\nre\nd\n t\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n [\nK\n]\n\nBlackbody temperature [K]\n\n? = 0.8\n\n? = 0.5\n\n? = 0.25\n\n\n\n152 \n\n \n\nnecessary to enable neglecting the radiative emission of the plate, by studying the \n\ntemperature distribution over it.  \n\nIllustrated in Figure 3.17 is the variation of plate temperatures for the \n\nmaximum furnace temperature of 1773 K and various transpiration mass flows and \n\nplate emissivities. Another less evident but nevertheless intuitive parameter must also \n\nbe taken into account, and that is the temperature of the compressed air supply. While \n\nvalues measured in the laboratory in the months of August and September were \n\ntypically between 20 and 25\u00baC and most of the time closer to the latter value (which \n\nfor that motive was used as a reference in simulations), values measured in December \n\ncould be as low as 10\u00baC, which rendered relevant a study of the influence of air supply \n\ntemperature, since some differences are expected for lower heat flux levels and higher \n\nmass flows. This effect must be taken into account in practice for calibration and \n\noperation purposes, by specifying a correction coefficient for the airflow temperature \n\nthat can take the form of the deviation percentage shown in Figure 3.18, where \n\ntemperatures obtained at 10\u00baC are divided by those obtained at 25\u00baC. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17 \u2013 Plate temperatures as a function of transpiration mass flows and sensing element \n\nemissivities. \n\n \n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\n600\n\n650\n\n700\n\n750\n\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05\n\nM\ne\na\nsu\nre\nd\n t\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n [\nK\n]\n\nMass flow [kgs-1]\n\n? = 0.8\n\n? = 0.5\n\n? = 0.25\n\n\n\n153 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.18 \u2013 Percentage of deviation in measured temperatures for different supply \n\ntemperatures. \n\n \n\nThese results emphasize the need of using relatively high transpiration mass \n\nflows for emission component minimization purposes. It should be kept in mind that \n\nhigher mass flows could possibly lead to compressibility issues in the perforated plate. \n\nThere is therefore a need to balance the sensitivity of the system with the assumption \n\nof insignificant emission values and the guarantee of boundary layer blow off. \n\nBesides boundary layer blow-off and refrigeration considerations requirements \n\nthat tend to dictate that mass flows be kept as high as possible in most situations, the \n\neffect of increasingly high mass flows, obviously bounded by the onset of \n\ncompressibility and choked flow, is to diminish the dependence of the instrument \n\noutput on the mass flow, and this effect is visible in the asymptotic behaviour of the \n\nsensor temperature curves, that flatten for increasing mass flows.  \n\nAttaining a temperature reading value independent of the mass flow may not be \n\npossible for the reasons mentioned above, but another effect of the high mass flows is to \n\ndiminish the instrument\u2019s sensitivity for a given furnace temperature range, since the \n\nrelative magnitude of values measured by the thermocouple will be compressed, so to \n\nspeak, to a narrower temperature range.  \n\n0.0%\n\n0.5%\n\n1.0%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\n2.5%\n\n3.0%\n\n3.5%\n\n4.0%\n\n4.5%\n\n5.0%\n\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05\n\nD\ne\nv\nia\nti\no\nn\n p\ne\nrc\ne\nn\nta\ng\ne\n [\n%\n]\n\nMass flow [kgs-1]\n\n\n\n154 \n\n \n\nA maximum plate temperature can be defined as the temperature that, resulting \n\nin an emission component: \n\n \n\n 4\nem max\n\nq T??=   (3.23) \n\n \n\nwill lead to a relationship where emitted radiative flux will be a small percentage of the \n\nreceived flux, of the type: \n\n \n\n \nem rec\n\n0.02q q&lt;  (3.24) \n\n \n\nor \n\n \n\n \n\n0.25 0.25\n4\n\nrec furnace furnace\nmax\n\nplate plate\n\n0.02 0.02q T\nT\n\n?\n\n? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?&lt;=? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ?\n.  (3.25) \n\n \n\nIllustrated in Table 3.4 are the maximum admissible temperatures that satisfy \n\nthe 2% requirement, listed for various plate emissivities and furnace temperatures, \n\nassuming blackbody behaviour for the furnace cavity. A comparison between the values \n\nin the table and the graphs in Figures 3.16 and 3.18 shows that the fulfilment of the \n\nrequirement is not particularly troublesome, even for blackbody furnaces and \n\nexpectably even less so for sources with smaller emissivities. \n\nLikewise, a maximum value for the transpiration airflow can be defined for \n\naccuracy and sensitivity reasons, but while earlier transpiration radiometers relied on \n\nthe measurement of a temperature difference that could be rendered too small for \n\naccuracy by high mass flows, the present instrument only measures one temperature. \n\nIts sensitivity over a range of temperatures is however strongly affected by the mass \n\nflow as mentioned above, but a mass flow value that would render the line slopes of \n\nFigure 3.18 too small to be meaningfully measured would be limited by the onset of \n\nchoked flow conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\n155 \n\n \n\nTable 3.4 \u2013 Maximum admissible temperatures for emission component minimization. \n\nFurnace Temperature [K] \nPlate Emissivity \n\n0.8 0.5 0.25 \n\n1773 705 793 943 \n\n1523 606 681 810 \n\n1273 506 569 677 \n\n1023 407 457 544 \n\n773 307 346 411 \n\n \n\nA sensitivity coefficient for the instrument can be defined as the ratio between \n\nits output signal and the received heat flux, the measured temperature also depending \n\non the transpiration mass flow in addition to the received heat flux. The sensitivity \n\ncoefficient can thus be plotted as the ratio Tmeasured ? qrec for the range of transpiration \n\nmass flows [Martins 1998]. \n\nA linear relationship will exist between the thermocouple reading and the fourth \n\npower of the furnace temperature, which multiplied by the Stefan-Boltzmann constant \n\nand the furnace cavity emissivity becomes the radiation emitted by the source. This \n\nlinear relationship enables the determination of the heat flux for a given temperature \n\nreading, and can also be expressed in an inverse fashion, with the measured \n\ntemperature as function of the incident heat flux. This alternate version represents the \n\nrelationship between the instrument\u2019s output and the incident radiation and is useful \n\nbecause the linear relationship is preserved when the incident radiation is divided by \n\nthe mass flow at which the curve was obtained. This allows a direct representation of \n\nthe linearity of the steady-state instrument response, each instrument having its \n\nparticular curve as an individual characteristic [Martins 1998]. These considerations \n\napply for steady state conditions, while the intended pulsed transpiration mode is \n\nintrinsically transient. The simulation of transient conditions will be discussed later, \n\nbut such considerations are nevertheless useful given the fact that the instrument under \n\ndiscussion can conceivably be used as a conventional, steady state transpiration \n\n\n\n156 \n\n \n\nradiometer, although this is not its intended function and its calibration in such \n\nconditions was not carried-out. \n\n3.4.3 External Refrigeration System Temperatures \n\nAs mentioned above the presence of a swirling component in the refrigeration airflow, \n\ninjected tangentially in the non-porous casing base and intended to augment its \n\nresidence time in the space between the solid cone and the porous holder, makes the \n\nuse of the 60\u00ba symmetry more problematic, first of all because more mesh elements \n\nwould be needed. Periodic boundary conditions could have been used in order to \n\nreproduce the swirling airflow but a less computationally burdensome solution was used \n\ninstead. With the exception of the microperforated plate, the geometry of all \n\ncomponents, including the porous holder, is fully modelled. The microperforated plate \n\nis modelled as a second porous medium for which an interfacial contact area between \n\nsolid and fluid phases was easily calculated given the very well-ordered geometry of the \n\nplate. \n\nDespite the fact that the bulk of the system refrigeration comes from the \n\ntranspiration airflow, simulated values for the temperatures achieved at the surface \n\nwhere the perforated plate is attached to the porous holder were obtained in two \n\ndistinct parametric studies. In all cases a heat transfer coefficient was set in the plate, \n\nwith the same magnitude as discussed in Chapter 2 for the convection coefficient in the \n\nperforated pattern, but with a low, conservative value. Furnace temperatures were set \n\nat their maximum value of 1500\u00baC. In the first, the refrigeration airflow is set to zero \n\nwhile various transpiration mass flows are simulated passing through the perforated \n\nplate, corresponding to a situation where all the plate refrigeration comes from \n\ntranspiration. A conservative value for the convection coefficient in the porous medium \n\nwas assumed, and the radiation source was set as a blackbody, which will not \n\nnecessarily be the case in practice. Average temperatures on the interface between the \n\nplate and the porous medium can be determined, as illustrated in Figure 3.19. These \n\ntemperature values are useful because they can serve as pessimistic estimates for the \n\nfixed outer refrigeration temperature assumed in the parametric studies of plate \n\ntemperatures. Figure 3.19 shows that the value set at 200\u00baC was indeed on the high \n\nside and that temperatures on the rim of the plate are lower. \n\n\n\n157 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.19 \u2013 Average temperatures on the interface between the plate and the porous medium \n\nfor various transpiration mass flows. \n\n \n\nIn the second study the transpiration and refrigeration airflows were both set at \n\n0.0005 kgs-1 and the same temperatures as above were determined and are illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.20. The same conclusion as above regarding the fixed outer refrigeration \n\ntemperature applies. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.20 \u2013 Average temperatures on the interface between the plate and the porous medium \n\nfor various convection heat transfer coefficients. \n\n370\n\n390\n\n410\n\n430\n\n450\n\n470\n\n490\n\n510\n\n0 0.0002 0.0004 0.0006 0.0008 0.001\n\nIn\nte\nrf\na\nce\n t\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n [\nK\n]\n\nTranspiration mass flow [kgs-1]\n\n340\n\n342\n\n344\n\n346\n\n348\n\n350\n\n352\n\n354\n\n356\n\n358\n\n360\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nIn\nte\nrf\na\nce\n t\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\nti\nu\nre\n [\nK\n]\n\nPorous medium convection coefficient [Wm-2K-1]\n\n\n\n158 \n\n \n\n3.4.4 Transient Temperature Curves \n\nThe intended pulsed operation mode for the instrument dictates that the transient \n\nbehaviour of its sensing element be studied, when exposed to variations in incident heat \n\nflux, or more particularly in this context when variations occur in the transpiration \n\nairflow. \n\nBesides the matter of ascertaining whether the default airflow is supercritical or \n\nnot and the implications of this fact on the nature of the heat flux being measured, the \n\nintensity of the pulses must be adjusted to ensure that temperature levels in the plate \n\nare kept within reasonable limits. Besides the obvious requirement of avoiding excessive \n\ntemperatures that could damage the components of the system, the plate emission \n\ncomponent of the radiative heat balance must be must once again be considered. \n\nA steady-state first approach to the problem will result in temperature profiles \n\nsuch as those illustrated in Figures 3.16 and 3.17, and temperature levels for the \n\ninstrument operating purely as a radiometer can be evaluated in this way. Once the \n\ntranspiration airflow is reduced or even shut down, temperatures will rapidly rise to \n\nhigh values, so it is impractical to keep the airflow at low levels for significant times. \n\nThis is nevertheless an improvement over previous transpiration radiometers, where the \n\ntranspiration airflow had to be kept at high values at all times in order not to \n\ncompromise the sensing element\u2019s cooling, transient behaviours being induced using \n\nmechanical shutters in front of the furnace openings. \n\nVarious transient simulations were therefore conducted in order to gain some \n\ninsight into the sensing element\u2019s thermal behaviour when subjected to sudden \n\nvariations in incident heat fluxes or transpiration mass flows. Such simulations were set \n\nup using the results of steady-state simulations as initial values and were especially \n\nintended to evaluate the slopes of the transient temperature curves to be expected in \n\npractice.  \n\nThe effect of increased furnace temperatures starting from a moderate initial \n\nvalue were simulated first, in a process akin to that described for the transient testing \n\nof earlier transpiration radiometers where the transient behaviours were obtained \n\nthrough the use of a mechanical shutter placed between the sensing element and the \n\nfurnace. Illustrated in Figure 3.21 are transient temperature curves at the centre of the \n\n\n\n159 \n\n \n\nplate for a situation where a 0.001 kgs-1 transpiration mass flow crosses the sensing \n\nelement, initially for a blackbody cavity temperature of 1023 K and then subjected to \n\nsteps in furnace temperature to 1273, 1523 and 1773 K. The surface emissivity of the \n\nsensing element was set at 0.8.  \n\nSimulated next were more relevant situations where the transient behaviour is \n\nobtained by variations in the transpiration mass flow. The same initial situation as \n\nabove was used, and steps in the initial 1 gs-1 mass flow were specified at 0.25, 0.5, 2.5 \n\nand 5 gs-1 and no variation in the furnace temperature, with the resulting transient \n\ntemperature curves at the centre of the plate illustrated in Figure 3.22. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.21 \u2013 Transient temperature curves at the centre of the plate for various steps in \n\nfurnace temperature and a constant transpiration mass flow. \n\n \n\n \n\n325\n\n375\n\n425\n\n475\n\n525\n\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50\n\nT\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n [\nK\n]\n\nTime [s]\n\n1273 K\n\n1523 K\n\n1773 K\n\n\n\n160 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.22 \u2013 Transient temperature curves at the centre of the plate for various steps in \n\ntranspiration mass flow and a constant furnace temperature. \n\n \n\nIn all cases differences in the slopes of the transient temperature curves are \n\nevident, depending of the intensity of the driving force for the temperature variation, \n\ni.e. higher temperatures or more or less refrigeration, and as expected the intensity of \n\nthe rate of change, materialized in the slopes, is higher for larger steps in temperature, \n\npositive for lessened transpiration airflows and negative (reflecting a cooling process) \n\nfor heightened transpiration airflows.  \n\nNotice that in all cases the transpiration airflow was never shut off, while the \n\nintended pulsed transpiration operation mode will demand such conditions, or at least \n\nwill require significantly lower transpiration mass flows in order to enable the \n\nmeasurement of the convective component of the incident heat flux. \n\n As mentioned earlier, such situations where the transpiration airflow is cut are \n\nsimulated by setting the local fluid temperature at the same value as the external \n\nblackbody temperature, to get a sense of the magnitude of the slopes of the resulting \n\ntemperature curves, that would never be allowed in practice but that could conceivably \n\nbe encountered and dictate such transient responses before the transpiration mass flow \n\nwas reset at its initial value.  \n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\n\n325\n\n330\n\n335\n\n340\n\n345\n\n350\n\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50\n\nT\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n [\nK\n]\n\nTime [s]\n\n0.25 g/s\n\n0.5 g/s\n\n2.5 g/s\n\n5 g/s\n\n\n\n161 \n\n \n\nThe pulsed transpiration operation mode means that the stabilized temperature \n\nvalues shown above will never be reached due to a continuous switching on and off of \n\nthe transpiration airflow. In practical terms this means that the temperature must be \n\nmonitored and the electrovalve that controls the transpiration airflow must open when \n\ntemperatures above a specified value are detected. On the other hand, as mentioned \n\nearlier, the valve does not have to stay shut until stable readings are obtained for the \n\ntotal heat flux, since measuring the slope of the transient temperature curve allows the \n\nanticipation of this steady-state value because of its proportionality to the incident \n\nheat flux [Hit 2004, Martins et al. 2006]. \n\nThe use of short duration pulses is also relevant because if the on/off cycles are \n\nshort enough, it can be assumed that conditions in the surroundings have not changed \n\nsignificantly and heat flux partitioning is achieved because both components of the \n\ntotal heat flux are measured, radiation directly and convection by difference between \n\nsuccessive total flux and radiation measurements. This is possible provided that the \n\ndata acquisition system has enough time resolution for the purpose and places \n\nchallenges in terms of temporal resolution and noise levels that must be adequately \n\naddressed. \n\nThe new element\u2019s much lower thermal inertia makes for much faster \n\ntemperature curve responses, which in turn allow the switching off of the transpiration \n\nairflow for very brief times that nevertheless allow sufficient temperature increases for \n\ncurve slope calculation and total heat flux determination, although it is conceivable \n\nthat in some situations it may be practical to wait for steady-state values if variations \n\nare sufficiently rapid, as would be the case in high temperature and high transpiration \n\nmass flows situations. \n\nThe software does not allow the direct specification of two different alternate \n\nmass flows, so a step function (set either at a zero or one value) controlled by a sine \n\nfunction using the intended period as an argument was implemented to control the \n\nairflow value as a function of time.  \n\nThe adjustment of the periodicity of the mass flow pulses will be dictated by \n\nthe instrument response as a function of prevalent temperatures and mass flow \n\n\n\n162 \n\n \n\ncombinations and will require some level of adjustment and calibration in any case to \n\nkeep temperatures within reasonable bounds, as discussed further in Chapter 4. \n\nIllustrated in Figure 3.23 are CFX output graphs two different furnace \n\ntemperature-transpiration airflow combinations where the measured temperature values \n\nare kept roughly within the same range by adjusting the pulse period. Temperatures \n\nrise when the airflow is set to zero by the step function and decreases when the mass \n\nflow is reset at its default specified value. Mass flows and furnace temperatures were in \n\nthese cases set to moderate values in order to illustrate curves with equally moderate \n\nslopes. As discussed in Chapter 4, very steep variations are encountered in practice. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.23 \u2013 Transient temperatures in the plate. \n\n \n\nThe intended transient transpiration mode means that the instrument \n\ncalibration is not to be carried out as for conventional transpiration radiometer, but \n\nrather by determining the variation in slope of the transient temperature curves for a \n\nvariety of conditions.  \n\nSince a large number of on/off cycles (within limitations imposed by a minimum \n\ntemperature interval necessary for slope determination and by the electrovalve \n\n\n\n163 \n\n \n\nresponse) is expected to occur for any given time interval, a calibration process will \n\nconsist of the analysis of response curve slopes with the intention of establishing a \n\nquantitative linear relationship between furnace set points, transpiration airflows and \n\ntransient temperature curves slopes, as discussed in detail in Chapter 4. \n\n3.5 Concluding Remarks \n\nThe dimensional and operational parameters that influence sensor performance were \n\ndetermined and discussed, based both on established analytical principles and on the \n\nsimulation software that was compared to the analytical models discussed in the \n\nprevious chapter. \n\nAssumptions and simplifications made in the process of developing the \n\nanalytical model were discussed and found to be reasonable. \n\nRanges for the relevant mass flow values to be used for the intended range of \n\nfurnace working temperatures could also be identified in order to guarantee the \n\nsimplification of the radiative balance between the plate and its surroundings and to \n\nensure proper boundary layer control while avoiding compressibility phenomena. The \n\ninstrument\u2019s transient behaviour was also found to be within expectations and the \n\nproposed external cooling system was likewise found satisfactory in theory. \n\nThese procedures in turn led to the building of the prototypes discussed in the \n\nfollowing chapter and provided the framework to evaluate their performance, by \n\ncomparison with simulated values determined using the methodologies discussed above, \n\nalthough necessary adjustments naturally had to be made in order to accommodate \n\ndifferences dictated by laboratory conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n164 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n165 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\nEXPERIMENTAL STUDY \n\n \n\nA detailed discussion of the experimental setup is presented along with \n\nthe presentation and discussion of data acquisition and control setups. \n\nThe specifications of the various components that were used in the \n\ncourse of the experimental work are presented and their integration \n\ninto the data acquisition and control system are detailed along with \n\nimplemented methodologies and procedures. Special relevance is given \n\nto the data processing flow and operations. Measurements carried out \n\nwith the discussed setup are described and relevant comparisons with \n\npreviously developed analytical and numerical models are made against \n\nexperimental data. Instrument calibration procedures are also \n\nproposed, described and discussed, together with the experimental \n\nuncertainty analysis. \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nIn the previous chapter design strategies based on the use of analytical and numerical \n\nmodels for the heat and mass transfer phenomena in the sensing element were \n\npresented, discussed and used to build design rules in order to meet requirements, \n\nprototypes of the instrument being built based on those design rules. \n\nThese prototypes are identical as far as their principal physical features are \n\nconcerned, although small differences resulting from the various manufacturing and \n\nassembly processes cannot be ruled out and will addressed later in order to verify if \n\nsignificant biases are induced. In the present chapter the experimental verification of \n\nthe instrument prototypes is presented and discussed.  \n\nThe chapter starts with a discussion of the experimental setup and of the \n\nequipment selection procedures, along with the presentation and discussion of data \n\nacquisition and control setups. The various components that were used in the course of \n\nthe experimental work are presented, while their integration into the data acquisition \n\nand control system is detailed along with implemented methodologies and procedures, \n\n\n\n166 \n\n \n\nincluding the data processing flow and operations. Measurements carried out with the \n\ndiscussed setup are described and relevant comparisons with previously developed \n\nanalytical and numerical models are made against experimental data. Instrument \n\ncalibration procedures are also discussed.  \n\n4.2 Integrated Hardware and the Prototype \n\nThe essential components of the experimental set-up comprise the above-described flux \n\nmeter instrument, a radiation source and a data acquisition and processing system, as \n\nillustrated in Figure 4.1. Characteristics of the various components are given in detail \n\nin the next paragraphs. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe transpiration gas mass flow rate control and measurement is a fundamental \n\naspect in the operation the present instrument, and accurate heat flux measurements \n\nare dependent not only of an accurate measurement of the temperature in the \n\nmicroperforated plate but also of a precise control and measurement of the \n\ntranspiration gas mass flow rate. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, compressed air was chosen as the transpiration gas. A \n\npressure regulator, a gas filter, a rotameter and two manometers compose the TG \n\ncontrol unit. The pressure regulator has the function of uncoupling the pressure in the \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Experimental System. \n\n\n\n167 \n\n \n\ninstrument air circuit from that in the air supply line. Without this regulator, any \n\npressure fluctuation in the line would be transmitted to the instrument circuit resulting \n\nin TG mass flow fluctuations affecting the instrument readings. The filter was chosen \n\nso that its grade efficiency is higher to that of the porous disc material, filtering \n\nparticles as small as 5 \u00b5m.  \n\nThe rotameter (and its associated needle valve) has the function of controlling \n\nand measuring the TG mass flow rate. Depending on the TG mass flow rate, different \n\npressure levels are obtained downstream, so that a manometer is required to calculate \n\nthe actual mass flow rate. Figure 4.2 shows a photograph of the TG control unity panel \n\ntogether with the corresponding diagram. A digital mass flow meter was also available \n\nand was tested, showing similar readings to those of the rotameter. Since the latter \n\ncaused lesser pressure losses and was easier to control, it was used preferentially. \n\nThe pressure regulator and the filter are standard pneumatic devices from \n\nParker Hannifin Co. with a maximum input pressure of 10 bar and a maximum output \n\npressure of 6 bar. The rotameter is an Omega Engineering instrument (FL-3840ST \n\nmodel) with maximum output of 40 SLPM of air at 20\u00baC and 1.013 bar, an accuracy of \n\n\u00b12% FS and a repeatability of \u00b10.25% FS. The manometers are manufactured by \n\nVDO and have a maximum output of 4 bar and an accuracy of \u00b12.5% FS. Only the \n\ntranspiration airflow is connected to this setup, the refrigeration airflow being \n\nconnected to the same compressed air supply but without any control besides \n\npreliminary checks that were sufficient to ensure that the refrigeration mass flow values \n\nemployed in the simulations discussed in Chapter 3 were actually exceeded in practice, \n\nalthough in part due to some leakage within the sensor casing, as discussed further \n\nbelow. \n\nThe overall configuration of the instrument was discussed in Chapter 3, along \n\nwith the dimensioning if the main features of the most important system components, \n\nnamely the microperforated plate, the airflow separation cone, the porous outer casing \n\nand the non-porous base on top of which the porous holder is placed. The \n\naforementioned components are illustrated and briefly discussed below. \n\n\n\n168 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Photograph and diagram of the TG measurement and control unit, \n\nshowing the pressure regulator (a), the rotameter (b) and the manometer (c). \n\n \n\nEach component was ordered in a total of 12 units with the available budget, \n\nexcept for the perforated plates, of which 50 were purchased.  It was at first thought to \n\nkeep some components in reserve but the decision was eventually taken to incorporate \n\nall available parts into prototypes, since some level of damage to the parts was to be \n\nexpected during testing and valuable time could be lost waiting for the assembly of new \n\nprototypes. \n\nA major concern was the robustness, or lack thereof, of the attachment of the \n\nthermocouple to the perforated plate. While some of the weldings eventually broke, \n\nmainly due to some rough handling such as being dropped, others resisted quite well, \n\nwhich indicates a need to improve both the robustness of the joint itself and the \n\nrepeatability of the welding process, transforming it from an artisanal task into an \n\nindustrial process. \n\n The microperforated plate is arguably the most important component given its \n\nfunction as a sensing element and as fundamental in preserving the transpiration \n\nprinciple. As discussed earlier a survey of providers, manufacturing technologies and \n\nprices for obtaining the plates resulted in the selection of photo-etched components that \n\nmade holes with diameters smaller than the plate thickness extremely difficult to \n\nobtain, thus placing limits on hole diameter to plate thickness ratios.  \n\n(b)(c)\n\n(a)\n\nbar\n\nbar\n\n\n\n169 \n\n \n\nThe stainless steel plates were provided by a leading photoetched component \n\nmanufacturer, Precision Micro Ltd of Birmingham, UK. As illustrated in Figure 4.3 the \n\nprocess require some adjustments but did eventually result in the intended perforated \n\npattern. In order to increase their emissivity, an oxidisation procedure consisting in \n\nkeeping their temperature at 850\u00baC for approximately 8 hours was performed, although \n\na totally uniform matte black colour for the whole surface was not achieved. Figure 4.4 \n\nshows an oxidized plate after it was mated to the porous holder and with the \n\nthermocouple laser-welded on, together with a non-oxidized sample. A difference in \n\nsurface colour is apparent but the surface is still highly specular, so this treatment \n\nprobably had little effect and the surface emissivity is probably close to that of the \n\noriginal non-oxidized stainless steel. \n\nThe determination of surface emissivities is a field of its own and has given rise \n\nto a large number of publication, including detailed studies for relevant emissivity \n\nmeasurement methodologies in materials of interest such as different types of steel at \n\ncomparatively low temperatures [Carpenter and Sewell 1962], or for much higher \n\ntemperature values [Paloposki and Liedquist 2005], as well as for other metallic alloys \n\n[Maynard 2011]. In any case it is apparent that the emissivity values usually \n\nencountered in technical tables are consistent and generally accurate, and indicate that \n\nemissivities for polished, non-oxidized stainless steel such as the one received from the \n\nmanufacturer typically has a surface emissivity lower than 0.2 and potentially as small \n\nas 0.1. \n\nThe temperature and time of this oxidization process could have been increased, \n\nbut given the plate\u2019s very low thickness and small hole diameters there were some \n\nconcerns that stronger oxidization could weaken the component and render it unable to \n\nwithstand the air pressure from the transpiration airflow, so the matter was not \n\npursued further. \n\n\n\n170 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIllustrated next in Figures 4.5 and 4.6 are the stainless steel non-porous base \n\n(including the refrigeration airflow tubing) and airflow separation cone (including the \n\nsmall hole where the thermocouple is passed). Both components were machined used \n\nstandard turning and milling equipment, and sourced from local manufacturers. The \n\ncone was the more difficult of the two to obtain, given the need of long and thin \n\nturning cutting tools for the machining of its inner cavity. This capability was not as \n\neasy to find locally as expected but was nevertheless found at in injection moulds \n\nmanufacturing company in the Aveiro region, without the need of purchasing special \n\ntools for the purpose. \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Microperforated plate: early unsuccessful attempt and detailed view of the intended \n\nmicroperforated pattern. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Non-oxidized plate sample and oxidized unit mounted on instrument. \n\n\n\n171 \n\n \n\n \n\nIllustrated next is the porous holder (Figure 4.7). This component was \n\nsomewhat more difficult to obtain, for various reasons.  \n\nSome companies specializing in porous components were contacted in order to \n\nascertain their capabilities in terms of part specifications, both in terms of porosity \n\nparameters and achievable dimensional tolerances. The latter item was especially \n\nrelevant because of the small dimensions of some parts of the components. These were \n\ntypically obtained by building moulds which were then filled with small diameter metal \n\nspheres that were subsequently sintered. Given the fact that a relatively small number \n\nof components was to be ordered for the prototypes, delivery times and most of all \n\nprices were regarded as being unreasonable because they represented a significant \n\nportion of the available budget. Smaller unit prices could only have been obtained for \n\nmuch larger orders that would have been too costly to consider, especially as far as \n\nearly prototypes are concerned, since lessons learned during this study could not have \n\nbeen incorporated. There was therefore a need to find a viable alternative. \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Non-porous base and refrigeration airflow tubing. \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Non-porous cone for airflow separation. \n\n\n\n172 \n\n \n\nSome industries rely on porous steel components that are machined from porous \n\nblocks rather than moulded. Plastic injection mould manufacturers, for instance, use \n\nporous steel in some parts of the moulds for degassing purposes, and such parts could \n\nbe machined from commercially available porous blocks. The porosity parameters were \n\nnot necessarily optimal regarding the porous medium performance but some \n\ncompromise was necessary if components were to be obtained at a reasonable cost for \n\nan adequate performance. This less optimal solution meant that there was not as much \n\nfreedom of choice in terms of unit cell and pore configurations as for a custom made \n\nporous medium. This in turn did not for instance allow the selection of better studied \n\nporous structures for which more analytical and empirical relationships would have \n\nbeen available for use in the numerical studies mentioned in the previous chapter. \n\nThe parts were thus made using metal manufactured by International Mould \n\nSteel, Inc. of Florence, Kentucky, USA. Porcerax II comes as sintered steel blocks with \n\n25% porosity, consisting of interconnected pores averaging 7 microns in diameter, \n\ndispersed throughout the material. Thermal conductivity is similar to a 400 Series \n\nstainless steel. \n\n \n\n \n\nSeveral processing technologies for obtaining the final components can be used, \n\nalthough EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining) is recommended in order to maximize \n\nventing. This was done but in turn led to the occurrence of another potentially serious \n\nproblem. Component specifications were provided to a local company with EDM \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Porous holder. \n\n\n\n173 \n\n \n\nequipment and manufacturing proceeded without problems until the final step, where \n\nan employee polished the parts in order to make them look better. This obviously led \n\nto concerns regarding the maintenance of the surface porosity. Another EDM passage \n\nwas then performed and the components duly exhibited the rough surfaces typically \n\nobtained with EDM, but the extent to which polished could have affected porosity \n\nalong the component\u2019s thickness remained. \n\nOnce the prototypes were assembled and the compressed air lines were \n\nconnected, very little airflow was apparent by touch through the porous medium, which \n\nwas not completely unexpected considering the results of the CFD simulations \n\ndescribed in Chapter 3.  \n\nA very simple test was nevertheless carried out in order to illustrate the passage \n\nof the refrigeration airflow through the porous medium, using a drop of dishwashing \n\nliquid detergent dissolved in water. By dipping a fingertip in that water and then \n\ntouching the porous component, thus leaving a small amount of water on top of it, a \n\nfoaming of the detergent could immediately be observed, proving the passage of the \n\nairflow, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Porosity verification. \n\n \n\nThe matter of assembling the aforementioned components naturally came about \n\nnext. One of the interesting aspects of the proposals received from the porous \n\ncomponent manufacturers was the option of having all components built, assembled \n\nand factory-tested for airtightness. The greater part of the costs was that of the porous \n\n\n\n174 \n\n \n\ncomponents themselves, and as mentioned earlier was in itself sufficient to make finding \n\nanother option necessary, but such an option would have been the most interesting \n\nfrom a strictly technical point of view, if financially unpractical. It should nevertheless \n\nbe considered in future versions of the instrument, especially if the patenting process \n\nproceeds further. \n\nSince all components, including the central sheathed thermocouple, were \n\nmetallic in nature, some form of welding and brazing process was envisaged for their \n\nassembly. Local industries and workshops with welding capabilities were contacted but \n\nreplied that they were not up to the task of handling such small components, especially \n\nthe thermocouple.  \n\nWatchmakers or jewellers with the ability to carry out repairs were then sought \n\nbut such capabilities were found to be not as widespread as they once were. Watches \n\nare nowadays much more reliable than several decades ago, while typically either much \n\ncheaper and not worth repairing, or expensive but usually sent back to the \n\nmanufacturer for repairs. Jewellery is another matter and repairs must indeed take \n\nplace, usually being subcontracted to specialists that recommended contacting the \n\ninstitution where most of them get their training. \n\nThe Portuguese Professional Training Centre for the Jewelry and Watchmaking \n\nIndustries (CINDOR - Centro de Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Profissional da Ind\u00fastria de Ourivesaria e \n\nRelojoaria) was therefore contracted and one of the teachers at the institution proved \n\nable and willing to provide the necessary assembly services for a very reasonable fee. \n\nThe thermocouple was thus laser welded to the plate and the remaining components \n\nwere brazed to each other. This artisanal method proved sufficient in this early \n\nprototype phase of development but more systematic and repeatable industrial \n\nprocesses are necessary if and when commercial instruments are to be built, this matter \n\nand its implications being addressed in greater detail later on. \n\nTemperature measurements in the microperforated plate are made using \n\nungrounded 0.25 mm diameter, stainless steel sheathed, K-Type Omega thermocouples \n\n(KMQSS-IM025U-300) that are passed inside the conic element through a sealed hole \n\nin its lower tube and are then laser-welded to the centre of the microperforated plate. \n\nShown in Figure 4.9 is a close-up of the thermocouple attachment to the plate, once the \n\n\n\n175 \n\n \n\nlater has been brazed into place at the top of the porous holder.  The temperature \n\nprobes\u2019 output was verified for 273.15\u00baC and 373.15\u00baC and a maximum relative error of \n\n\u00b1 0.2 % was found, both using the thermocouple calibration hardware available in the \n\nlaboratory and the traditional boiling water/melting ice method. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Thermocouple attachment. \n\n \n\nAs discussed earlier one of the most important objectives was to significantly \n\ndiminish the overall dimensions of the system, when compared with earlier \n\ntranspiration radiometers. The achievement of this objective is readily visible in      \n\nFig. 4.10, where the proposed instrument is compared with an earlier, water cooled \n\nsystem [Martins 1998]. Shown are the water inlet, outlet and circulation system, the \n\ntranspiration airflow conduit and the two thermocouples required by the older \n\ninstrument. The newer system is much smaller thanks to its lower refrigeration \n\nnecessities, which allow the use of a much more compact air refrigeration system. The \n\ndifference in frontal area between systems is shown, being a potential issue in the \n\ninstallation of the sensors in systems where dimensions are restrictive factors. The \n\nearlier system is however more robust in actual operation, but this fact was a foregone \n\nconclusion evident from the start and was not the central issue. \n\n Visible are the transpiration and refrigeration compressed air tubes. The latter \n\nis wrapped in aluminium adhesive foil in order to reflect radiative heat coming from the \n\ncalibration furnace and avoid damage to the plastic tubing, given its proximity to the \n\n\n\n176 \n\n \n\nfurnace aperture and the fact that unlike the transpiration tubing it is not shielded by \n\nthe instrument body. A more detailed view of the prototype can be seen in Figure. \n\n4.11. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Size comparison between the proposed instrument and an earlier, water cooled \n\nsystem. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Assembled prototype. \n\n\n\n177 \n\n \n\nSome other problems became apparent during testing. It was found that the \n\naluminium adhesive foil intended to avoid damage to the plastic tubing by reflecting \n\nradiation coming from the furnace was not sufficient for the purpose. The plastic tubing \n\nwas not affected directly, but the adhesive that was used to glue it to the metal tube \n\nwas degraded, leading to its detachment under operation. Additional shielding was \n\ntherefore needed and provided as illustrated in Figure 4.12. It consists of a thin metal \n\nplate coated with reflective material that is fitted to the front of the furnace using \n\nadjusting and spacing nuts. The plate has a central opening with a diameter such that \n\nonly the instrument body can be fitted through it, leaving the refrigeration tubing on \n\nthe outside. \n\n \n\n \n\nEven this shielding was not sufficient depending of the configuration of the \n\nradiation source, which brings us to the matter of discussing its nature. \n\nThe primary radiation source, located in the laboratory of the Mechanical \n\nEngineering Department of the University of Aveiro, is a GERO RO 30-200 tubular \n\nfurnace capable of reaching temperatures up to 1500\u00baC. The furnace cavity is 30 mm in \n\ndiameter, 350 mm in length and is heated over the central 200 mm of its length. The \n\nheating module consists of electric resistance MoSi2 wire coiled around a ceramic tube, \n\nintegrated in light ceramic fibre insulation with a perforated stainless steel sheet \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 \u2013 Additional tubing shielding. \n\n\n\n178 \n\n \n\nhousing. The cavity\u2019s aspect ratio does not, however, insure that the radiating cavity \n\ncan be considered as a black body, given verified temperature non-uniformities along \n\nthe tube, as summarized in Table 4.1. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Furnace axial temperature profiles \n\nSet Point \n\nTemperature \n\n[\u00baC] \n\nPosition [cm] \n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 \n\n500 305 485 525 500 405 275 \n\n750 610 740 780 757 650 326 \n\n1000 808 986 1025 1000 890 580 \n\n \n\nIf the furnace was to be reliably used for calibration purposes, its cavity\u2019s \n\nemissivity needed to be determined in order to quantify the amount of thermal \n\nradiation that exits the cavity as a function of the furnace controller set point. A NEC \n\nTH-9100 infrared camera was used to measure the temperature of the cavity, averaged \n\nover its whole area and assuming a unitary emissivity. The apparent emissivity can be \n\ndefined as the ratio between the measured temperature value and the furnace set point: \n\n \n\n cav\napp\n\nset\n\nT\n\nT\n? =   (4.1) \n\n \n\nMeasurements were carried out over 4 days with ambient temperatures ranging \n\nbetween 21 and 25\u00baC for furnace set points of 750, 1000, 1250 and 1500\u00baC. These \n\nmeasurements lead to the calculated apparent cavity emissivities shown in Figure 4.13 \n\nalong with the underlying linear relationship, plotted using the averages of the cavity \n\ntemperatures and displaying the associated linear regression parameters. \n\n\n\n179 \n\n \n\n \n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the apparent emissivity distributions yield the \n\nrelationship shown below: \n\n \n\n 3\napp\n\n0.305 1.4 10? ?= \u00b1 \u00d7   (4.2) \n\n \n\nThis emissivity is for a situation where the end of the tubular furnace opposite \n\nto the instrument location is not fitted with the ceramic plug provided precisely for this \n\npurpose, as illustrated in Figure 4.14, where both options are shown. \n\n This open-end configuration had to be used because of the interaction between \n\nthe transpiration airflow and the furnace, especially at high set point temperatures. \n\nWith the other end closed, the transpiration airflow heated up significantly inside the \n\nfurnace cavity and was blown back towards the instrument, degrading the integrity of \n\nthe compressed air tubes and their gluing to the sensor casing, and degrading the \n\naluminium foil coatings of the shielding shown in Figure 4.12.  \n\nTests could thus not proceed in such conditions and the plug had to be removed \n\nto avoid the problem of the hot gas blowback. The use of the plug would have been \n\nbeneficial from the point of view of the apparent furnace emissivity, since it would have \n\nreflected some radiation directly to the surface across the length of the cavity and \n\ncertainly heated significantly and emitted a large amount of radiation, since it becomes \n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 Relationship between furnace set point and cavity temperatures. \n\ny = 0.3119x - 7.9363\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9999\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500\n\nM\ne\na\nsu\nre\nd\n t\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\nSet point temperature [\u00baC]\n\n\n\n180 \n\n \n\nvisibly red-hot. Apparent emissivities measured at the sensor location were shown to be \n\nmuch higher with the plug fitted. The plug can be modified by performing an oblique \n\nperforation that would enable the hot transpiration airflow to exit the cavity, without \n\nallowing radiation to directly escape the cavity. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe absence of the plug opens a significant area to cold surroundings, causing a \n\nlarge radiative transfer due to a large temperature difference even for surfaces where \n\nthe radiative view factor is not very large, as is the case of the central, heated portion \n\nof the cavity. Without surprise, the apparent emissivity for the configuration where the \n\nplug is fitted is: \n\n \n\n 4\napp\n\n0.88 1.82 10? ?= \u00b1 \u00d7   (4.3) \n\n \n\nAs discussed below, this must be taken into account when measurements are \n\ncompared with the simulations discussed in Chapter 3, since those were set up using \n\nunitary emissivities. \n\nOnce the emissivity can be safely dealt with, other measurements can take \n\nplace. More particularly, some contamination of the transpiration airflow by the \n\nrefrigeration airflow was detected, in the sense that some refrigeration compressed air \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.14 \u2013 End of the tubular furnace opposite to the instrument location, with \n\nand without the ceramic plug fitted. \n\n\n\n181 \n\n \n\ncrossed the sensing element due to perfectible welded joints between the porous holder \n\nand the interior cone. Given the fact that the measurement of the transpiration mass \n\nflow is a central element in the instrument\u2019s operation principle it was fundamental to \n\nquantify the magnitude of this contamination. \n\nThis was measured, for various refrigeration mass flows, by tightly fitting each \n\nsensor to a tube linked to a Omega FMA 1816 digital gas mass flowmeter while \n\nplugging the transpiration air inlet in order to ensure that all the possible leakage flows \n\nthrough the sensing element. The flowmeter has a 0-2 SLPM range with an accuracy of \n\n\u00b11.5 % FS. This setup is illustrated in Fig. 4.15. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe instruments were connected directly to the compressed air system and \n\ntested at various pressures up to 5 bar. Measurements were repeated three times for \n\neach instrument and the mean value at each pressure was determined with the \n\nobjective of determining the three units with the smaller contamination values, to be \n\nused in subsequent tests, where one of these eventually suffered damage in consequence. \n\nAs expected beforehand, airflow contamination was found to increase linearly \n\nwith pressure to a maximum at 5 bar. The highest contamination airflow registered was \n\n1.43 SLPM but even at 5 bar the selected instruments registered an average \n\ncontamination airflow of 0.67 SLPM. This is a very small value when compared to the \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 \u2013 Transpiration airflow contamination measurement. \n\n\n\n182 \n\n \n\ntranspiration airflows, meaning that in practice the measured transpiration mass flows \n\ndo not require an adjustment taking this contamination into account. \n\nThe output of the thermocouple was read using an Omega Engineering Inc. \n\ninstruNET series INET-100b acquisition and control system. InstruNet provides \n\nmicrovolt-range absolute accuracy, using a topology where the analogue electronics are \n\nclose to the sensor in electrically quiet boxes outside the PC, and noisy digital \n\nelectronics are left inside the computer. The external box contains signal conditioning \n\namplifiers for each channel and can be directly attached to sensors such as \n\nthermocouples, returning engineering units to the PC (e.g. \u00b0C or volts). The controller \n\ncontains a 32 bit microprocessor with 256KB of RAM that manages the external \n\n\u201cnetwork\u201d of devices and all real-time tasks are off-loaded to this processor, not \n\nburdening the host computer with real-time issues. The instruNet iNET-100 box \n\nprovides 16 single-ended/8 differential analogue inputs, 8 analogue outputs and 8 \n\ndigital I/O lines. The instruNet system supports the digitizing of multiple channels at a \n\nmaximum aggregate sample rate of 166Ks/sec, where each channel can be digitized at \n\nits own rate. According to specifications, K-type thermocouples connected to the \n\nsystem have accuracies (including cold junction compensation, voltage measurement \n\nand linearization errors) of \u00b10.6\u00baC in the temperature range of interest. \n\nRegarding the analysis of the instrument\u2019s transient response, the setup only \n\nhad to be slightly adjusted. A bifurcation in the compressed air supply before the \n\nmanometers and the rotameter provides the non-controlled refrigeration airflow, while \n\nthe remainder of the air supply proceed to these control units in order to allow the \n\ncontrol and measurement of the transpiration airflow using an electrovalve that is \n\ncommanded by the data acquisition system that monitors the instrument\u2019s output. \n\nUpper and lower temperature limits can be defined for switching on and off the \n\nairflow, or varying it between upper and lower values if the option of switching it off \n\ncompletely is not retained. The easiest way of implementing a complete elimination of \n\nthe airflow in its off position is merely disconnecting the tubing from the regulator on \n\nthe adequate side of the valve. \n\nThis can be implemented by feeding the transpiration airflow through two \n\npreviously adjusted flow regulators, depending of the position of the electrovalve, \n\n\n\n183 \n\n \n\nresulting in the configuration illustrated in Figure 4.16, while Figure 4.17 illustrated the \n\nelectrovalve and the flow regulators themselves. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16 \u2013 Transient airflow control setup. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 \u2013 Control electrovalve and flow regulators. \n\n\n\n184 \n\n \n\n4.3 Experimental Results \n\nThe experimental testing of the instrument included cool and hot experiments, the \n\nlatter being carried out both in steady state and in transient conditions. Broadly \n\nspeaking, such tests can be said to have the following objectives: \n\n\u2022 To confirm previously discussed mathematical and especially physical \n\nassumptions; \n\n\u2022 To test the instrument\u2019s repeatability; \n\n\u2022 To establish a calibration procedure and calibrate the instruments; \n\n\u2022 To seek possible additional relevant and unforeseen phenomena and effects. \n\nFor that purpose the instrument\u2019s output as a function of various transpiration \n\nmass flows and incident heat fluxes was studied, especially regarding the transient \n\nexperiments in order to establish the calibration of the instrument working as a \n\ntransient transpiration heat flux meter. \n\nThe aforementioned three units with lesser airflow contamination values were \n\ntested in order to verify the repeatability of the experimental results and establish the \n\ninstrument calibration curve. The tested instruments will henceforth be designated as \n\nSensor 1, Sensor 2 and Sensor 3. \n\nDuring cool experiments the radiation heat flux is negligible because the \n\ninstrument is exposed to room temperature, while in for the hot experiments the \n\ninstrument output is monitored for different known heat flux levels. These steady state \n\nexperiments were followed by a study of the transient response of the instruments, \n\nnamely the determination of the slopes associated with their temperature response \n\ncurves, and their calibration. \n\nThe cool experiments are intended to establish a reference output for a null \n\ninput that can be used to check and correct possible bias errors. The hot experiments, \n\non the other hand, are meant to verify the instrument performance in comparison with \n\nnumerical predictions obtained earlier. Despite the fact the instrument is intended to \n\nhave an intrinsically transient operation mode, steady-state calibration curves could be \n\nobtained at this point. This was not done given the intended transient operation, but \n\n\n\n185 \n\n \n\nthe instrument can always be looked upon as a steady-state instrument if the pulsed \n\nairflow is maintained at a constant value.   \n\nThe transient experiments are foremost in importance since they are meant to \n\nestablish the instrument\u2019s transient operation mode calibration curves, i.e. when the \n\npulsed operation principle is used, where a linear relationship between the slope of the \n\ntransient temperature curve at the start of the pulse and the incoming heat flux is \n\nanticipated, as stated in Equation 2.1. \n\nDuring the setting up of the experiment, special care was required in order to \n\nreduce the noise associated to the thermocouple readings. This aspect was particularly \n\nimportant due to the low temperature levels to be measured, given the fact that the \n\nsurface temperatures of the sensing element were to be kept relatively low, as \n\nmentioned earlier. For that purpose, sheathed thermocouples were used and the sheaths \n\nwere connected to a common ground. \n\nIn the steady-state mode experiments, after each temperature or airflow level \n\nvariation, 5 minutes were allowed in order to let readings stabilize and the temperature \n\nmeasurements where then conducted during another 5 minutes at a 10 Hz sampling \n\nrate. The averaged temperature value for one second was taken as representative of the \n\ninstantaneous temperature, and the variation of this instantaneous value was then \n\nanalyzed over the whole sampling time. No need was found to make further \n\nadjustments since the observed fluctuations in signal fell within the range of \n\nthermocouple error, obviously unlike the situation described below regarding the setup \n\nfor transient measurements. \n\nFor the cool experiments, the instrument output was registered for different TG \n\nmass flow rates similar to those later considered for the hot experiments. The cooling \n\nsystem was active but the sensing surface was not receiving any relevant incident heat \n\nflux, while for the hot experiments the source furnace was heated up to the various set \n\npoints and staged at that temperature until stable temperature levels were attained. \n\nThe transpiration and refrigeration airflows were then set to the appropriate levels and \n\nthe heat flux meter was placed into the furnace cavity, at a position and depth where \n\nthe temperature measured by the thermocouple stabilises at the highest level, in order \n\nto minimize edge effects from the furnace cavity. \n\n\n\n186 \n\n \n\nThe radiation source temperature was continuously monitored and the \n\ntemperature readings from the flux meter thermocouples were taken after a stable \n\ncondition in the radiation source was obtained, as explained above. For each radiation \n\nflux level, different transpiration gas mass flows were considered and the corresponding \n\nflux meter output temperatures were read. Each measurement condition, defined by the \n\nradiation source temperature and the TG mass flow rate was repeated five times.  \n\nThe values considered for the radiation source temperature are listed in     \n\nTable 4.2 together with the corresponding blackbody radiation fluxes. As mentioned \n\nearlier, care must be taken when analyzing results given the fact that these values are \n\nfor blackbody emission and as mentioned earlier correction factors must be introduced \n\ndepending of the experimental setup used. In the case under discussion the furnace \n\nemissivity was corrected using Equation 4.2 and the emitted radiation was calculated \n\naccordingly, as described in Table 4.2. It is readily visible that the low apparent \n\nemissivity of the furnace to be employed has strongly detrimental effects as far as \n\nreachable heat flux levels are concerned, thereby limiting the testing range of the \n\ninstruments under discussion. \n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Furnace set points \n\nSet Point Temperature [\u00baC] qrad [kW/m\n2] qcorr [kW/m\n\n2] \n\n500 20.25 6.17 \n\n750 62.10 18.94 \n\n1000 148.90 45.42 \n\n1250 305.06 93.04 \n\n1500 560.30 170.89 \n\n \n\nRegarding transpiration mass flows, a rotameter was used in order to set 6 \n\nvolumetric flow levels (measured in the rotameter linear scale at 50, 70, 90, 110, 130 \n\nand 150mm) for each run, airflow pressures and temperatures being registered and used \n\nto compute mass flow rates from the volumetric rates using the calibration curve \n\nprovided by the manufacturer. \n\nConsidering the number of set points for the radiation source temperature (5) \n\nand transpiration mass flows (6) above, thirty different steady-state operation \n\n\n\n187 \n\n \n\nconditions were verified for each prototype. In addition, each working condition was \n\nverified five times, resulting in one hundred and twenty independent measurements for \n\nthe experimental verification of each instrument. \n\nThe setup for the transient experimental is the same from the point of view of \n\nthe use of the basic hardware, except for the fundamental issue of the implementation \n\nof the pulsed transpiration airflow. As discussed above this requires the use of the setup \n\nillustrated in Figures 4.15 and 4.16 and different procedures in terms of signal \n\nacquisition and processing, as discussed below in the relevant section. \n\nThe instrument output should ideally be zero for a null incident flux but there \n\nare a number of phenomena that may induce deviations from such an ideal scenario, \n\nresulting in bias errors. The output signal for a null heat flux can thus be useful in \n\norder to correct such errors. The same overall behaviour is apparent for all three \n\ninstruments and the example of Sensor 1 is illustrated in Figure 4.18, showing \n\nmeasured temperatures in five runs for each instrument where mass flows were \n\ngradually increased.  \n\nThe temperature scale shows that differences are negligible but an underlying \n\nphysical phenomenon is nevertheless evident. Similar effects were observed in earlier \n\napplications of transpiration radiometers [Martins 1998]. Different phenomena may \n\ncontribute for the results shown but it is not possible obtain a conclusion with the \n\navailable data. A global cooling effect due to the gas expansion after it passes through \n\nthe perforated pattern may be present, and the slight increase in temperature observed \n\nfor low mass flows can be due to some heating due to some amount of compression as \n\nthe air passes through the perforated pattern that is overwhelmed by the expansion \n\ncooling process at higher mass flows. The relatively low velocities involved, even within \n\nthe holes, are not expected to lead to a heat generation due to friction to play an \n\nimportant role.  \n\n\n\n188 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 \u2013 Sensor 1 cool experiment measured temperatures. \n\n \n\nThe matter is somewhat irrelevant for the intended transient conditions, due to \n\nthe large number of cycles occurring in very short times that lead to comparatively \n\nhigher plate temperatures and especially because in the transient mode the heat flux is \n\ndetermined based on the sensing element temperature variation with time and not on \n\nits absolute value, as would be the case in the steady state mode. \n\nAs mentioned earlier the hot experiments are intended to verify the \n\ninstrument\u2019s response to different heat flux levels, under different operating conditions \n\ndefined by various transpiration mass flows. The results for the upper attainable \n\nfurnace temperatures of 1500\u00baC must be taken with some caution due to the cooling \n\nload of the transpiration gas in the furnace cavity together with the latter\u2019s power \n\nlimitation, resulting in an effective lower temperature in the furnace cavity and \n\nconsequently in a lower heat flux.  \n\nWhen the higher mass flows where used the furnace visibly struggled to achieve \n\nthe required set point temperature, so that the aforementioned ceramic plug was placed \n\nin a partially closed position to enable some of the hot gas blowback discussed above to \n\nallow the furnace to reach higher temperatures. This in turn led to a need to use even \n\nmore tubing shielding on the compressed air feed lines. \n\n17.8\n\n18.0\n\n18.2\n\n18.4\n\n18.6\n\n18.8\n\n19.0\n\n0.0E+00 2.0E-04 4.0E-04 6.0E-04 8.0E-04 1.0E-03 1.2E-03\n\nM\ne\na\nsu\nre\nd\n T\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\ns \n[\u00ba\nC\n]\n\nMass Flow [kgs-1]\n\n\n\n189 \n\n \n\nThis procedure was tried but the variation induced in the furnace\u2019s apparent \n\nemissivity was felt to render the measured temperatures unreliable, so the values for \n\nthe 1500\u00baC set point in the furnace were left out of the steady-state experimental \n\nanalysis. \n\nCurves such as those illustrated in the previous chapter, where measured plate \n\ntemperatures are shown to be a function of furnace temperatures and transpiration \n\nmass flows, were obtained and show the same overall behaviour with one notable \n\nexception: the measured temperature scale is expectedly lower than the values \n\nsimulated for blackbody sources due to the lower apparent emissivity of the cavity of \n\nthe furnace employed in the laboratory experiment.  \n\nThe curves obtained for blackbody sources discussed in Chapter 3 must be \n\nadapted for comparison purposes between the numerical model and the experimental \n\nvalues, so new curves were obtained by correcting the blackbody temperature using the \n\napparent emissivity in Equation 4.3. As in Chapter 3 and for model validation \n\npurposes, these curves were obtained for a range of plate emissivities that allow a \n\ncomparison with the experimental response curve, as shown in Figure 4.19, where the \n\nmeans of the values obtained in the five runs conducted for each of the 3 sensors are \n\nalso displayed with 2% error bars on the lower simulated values. A mass flow of    \n\n0.001 kgs-1 was considered and the corrected heat fluxes are those of Table 4.2.  \n\nThe experimental values are consistent with a sensor surface emissivity of \n\naround 0.25, indicating that the oxidization process did not lead to the intended high \n\nemissivities. This is nevertheless somewhat irrelevant given the intended transient \n\noperation mode where the heat flux is determined based on the sensing element \n\ntemperature variation with time. \n\nThe instrument\u2019s performance over long times was evaluated by placing one of \n\nthe tested instruments in a larger furnace than the one discussed above, made available \n\nfor a limited time at the Department of Ceramics and Glass Engineering of the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro. Two 8 hour runs at its maximum temperature of 1300\u00baC on two \n\nconsecutive days were conducted in a closed furnace with a circular opening in its door, \n\nrendering the emissivity much higher than for the tubular furnace discussed above and \n\nthus exposing the sensing element to much higher radiative heat fluxes. \n\n\n\n190 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 \u2013 Numerical temperatures for the corrected furnace emissivity, various element \n\nemissivities and experimentally measured values for the same operational conditions. \n\n \n\nThe small diameter and large thickness of the opening in the furnace\u2019s door \n\nrendered impossible the use of the refrigeration airflow tubing, so that the instrument \n\nwas used with only the transpiration airflow switched on, with glass wool placed \n\naround the instrument in order to close the gap with the opening. The interior of the \n\nfurnace had significant amounts of ceramic dust particles that were stirred by the \n\ntranspiration airflow, thus replicating the aggressive and dirty environments where the \n\ninstrument is expected to perform. The configuration of the furnace and the placement \n\nof the instrument in its door are illustrated in Figure 4.20.  \n\nNo damage was apparent after the 16 hours of these tests, indicating that the \n\ninstrument has the potential to withstand adverse conditions over long periods of time, \n\nalthough further testing is desirable. These steady experiments provide added \n\nconfidence for the crucial component of the work under discussion, namely the analysis \n\nof the transient response. \n\n \n\n290.0\n\n300.0\n\n310.0\n\n320.0\n\n330.0\n\n340.0\n\n350.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nM\ne\na\nsu\nre\nd\n T\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\ne\nr \n[K\n\n]\n\nFurnace Heat Flux [kWm-2]\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\nMean - Sensor 1\n\nMean - Sensor 2\n\nMean - Sensor 3\n\n\n\n191 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 \u2013 Closed furnace for 8 hour runs. \n\n \n\nAs mentioned earlier the hot experiments are intended to verify the \n\ninstrument\u2019s response to different heat flux levels, under different operating conditions \n\ndefined by various transpiration mass flows. As discussed above these experiments were \n\nconducted both in steady-state but especially in transient conditions, in order to \n\nquantify the instrument\u2019s transient response, since this will be the basis of it transient \n\nmode operation. \n\nThe transient conditions were induced using the pulsed transpiration mass flow \n\nworking principle, meaning that when the airflow is turned on at a supercritical mass \n\nflux level the instrument will behave like a conventional transpiration radiometer, and \n\nthe temperature measured by the thermocouple attached to the perforated plate would \n\nbe a steady-state equilibrium value dictated by the incoming radiation heat flux and \n\nthe cooling provided by the transpiration airflow, if such conditions were allowed to be \n\nreached. This also means that although it was not the intent behind its development, \n\nthe instrument under discussion can also be used as a traditional transpiration \n\nradiometer.  \n\nThe situation where the airflow is eliminated and the boundary layer is no \n\nlonger blown off will present a dramatic increase in measured temperature driven not \n\nonly by the presence of a convective component in addition to the radiative component \n\n\n\n192 \n\n \n\nthat was already present, but also by the absence of transpiration cooling in the sensing \n\nelement. \n\nAs discussed earlier such a process would eventually lead to a steady-state value \n\nthat would be reached if temperatures were allowed to increase and stabilize, and \n\nwould indeed be proportional to the total received heat flux, according to the \n\nrelationship shown earlier in Equation 2.1: \n\n \n\n \ntotal\n\n0\n\nd\n\nd\nt\n\nT\nq\n\nt\n?\n\n=\n\n=   (4.4) \n\n \n\nwhere the slope of the transient temperature curve at the start of the pulse (hence the \n\nzero value for time) would be proportional to the incoming heat flux. \n\nAn adequate analysis of the sensing element\u2019s transient response is precisely \n\nintended to avoid reaching such high temperatures, allowing the resetting of the \n\nsupercritical transpiration mass flow once the proportionality constant ? is established. \n\nThis would enable the convenient assumption of a comparatively insignificant plate \n\nemission term and most importantly would avoid severe damage to the components \n\nand their welding and attachments.  \n\nFurthermore, if the process is carried out in a sufficiently rapid way, the \n\nradiative component of the heat flux can be treated as constant and the convective \n\ncomponent can be estimated based on the radiative heat flux measured for a \n\nsupercritical transpiration mass flow. A calibration of the transient transpiration \n\nradiometer would thus involve the determination of the proportionality constant ? for \n\nvarious incident heat fluxes, with temperature curves slopes being quantified in degrees \n\nper second (\u00baCs-1 or Ks-1). \n\nA previous attempt to verify the proposed formulation was developed within \n\nthis research team [Martins 1998, Martins et al. 1998, Martins et al. 2000], including \n\nexperimental studies using a different heat flux instrument, operated at a constant \n\nblow off mass flow rate, and using a diaphragm between the sensor and the radiation \n\nsource to create the transient. The performed studies showed a direct proportionality \n\nbetween the slope of the line tangent to the temperature response curve and the \n\n\n\n193 \n\n \n\nincident heat flux, the same slope being observed in the linear portion of the curve for \n\nthe same heat fluxes regardless of the initial temperature, establishing the soundness of \n\nthe transient transpiration principle [Hit 2004]. \n\nThe latter reference mentioned the difficulty of identifying the exact moment    \n\nt = 0 mentioned in Equation 2.1, with a precision sufficient to decide the exact starting \n\npoint for slope determination purposes, and suggested higher data acquisition \n\nfrequencies as a remedy. This problem is compounded by the noisy nature of the \n\noutput signal from the thermocouple, since even when the sensing element is \n\nexperiencing heating or cooling, as discussed earlier when its transient behaviour was \n\nsimulated, fluctuations in the temperature curve will manifest themselves and small \n\nvariations from one instant to the next can even be contrary to the overall heating or \n\ncooling tendency, rendering necessary some form of filtering to account for fluctuations \n\nin the signal, as discussed below. \n\nThe output of the thermocouple was read using the same data acquisition \n\nsystem, connecting its terminals to the external box that contains the signal \n\nconditioning amplifiers that convert millivolt readings to \u00b0C, with the \u00b10.6\u00baC \n\naccuracies for K-type thermocouples. The acquisition and control system was \n\nprogrammed to control the electrovalve open and close cycles based on maximum and \n\nminimum cycle temperatures rather than on a time period. This option was retained in \n\norder to ensure that a possibly less than judicious period selection does not result in \n\nexcessive temperatures in the sensing element, due to the valve being closed for too \n\nlong. The valve opens when the maximum cycle temperature is reached, letting the \n\ntranspiration airflow eliminate the convection heat transfer and cool the sensing \n\nelement until the lower cycle temperature is reached and the valve closes again. Some \n\nmeasured temperature overshoot is always to be expected at both ends of the \n\ntemperature spectrum, due to some delay in the response of the valve and some \n\ncontroller drift. \n\nAn acquisition frequency must also be defined, at a value sufficiently high to \n\ncapture the transient temperature variations occurring in the element, so that care \n\nmust be taken to ensure that the frequency is sufficiently high in order not to miss \n\npossible temperature curve inflexions. This parameter was duly taken into account in \n\nthe experimental study, as discussed below. \n\n\n\n194 \n\n \n\nThe system was also programmed to register the valve position (0 for closed and \n\n1 for open), writing results as standard csv (comma separated values) files that can be \n\nopen and processed in software such as Excel, Mathematica or Matlab. A real-time \n\ninterface is available and allows a continuous monitoring of the measurements, as \n\nillustrated in Figure 4.21. The noisy nature of the temperature signals is evident in \n\nmost measurement runs and the interface allows some magnification in terms both of \n\ntime and temperature. Such an interface is always useful, if only for interrupting a \n\nmeasurement run if something is visibly wrong with the process. It also allows a \n\nvisualisation of the signal stabilization, since some transient adjustment must always be \n\nconsidered at the start of each experiment. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.21 \u2013 Data acquisition system real-time interface. \n\n \n\nFiles resulting from the described procedure contain information about the \n\ninstant of measurement, the position of the valve and measured temperatures. When \n\nplotted the files show the same basic information, as illustrated in Figure 4.22, \n\ndisplaying \u201craw\u201d values, before any data processing procedures are applied. Noise in \n\nthe temperature signal is not usually perceptible unless a certain degree of \n\nmagnification is used (which is not necessarily practical in most situations where an \n\nentire experimental run is to be visualized for analysis purposes), but is nevertheless \n\nalways present and should be dealt with either by reducing its magnitude or by \n\nprocessing the obtained data. Another phenomenon can also be noticed in the lower \n\nvalues of the temperature cycles, namely a variation over time. As can be seen by the \n\n\n\n195 \n\n \n\ntime values the graph plots temperatures at the start of the run, where the instrument \n\noutput has not stabilized. Care was therefore taken in the calibration runs, starting \n\nmeasurements only after such effects were no longer apparent, which occurred after a \n\nfew minutes. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22 \u2013 Raw data plots. \n\n \n\nWhile the data acquisition procedures should be tailored to reduce as much as \n\npossible the noise levels in the signal, and although the transient data found in the \n\nwork under discussion are not particularly noisy when compared to those found in \n\nother applications, some form of data filtering is desirable in order to make the trends \n\nin the data stand out from background noise. Furthermore, when seeking a calibration \n\ncurve for the instrument, these noisy data must be adequately processed for a correct \n\ncalculation of transient temperature curve slopes. \n\nFor the case under discussion, the use of the Savitzky-Golay smoothing \n\nalgorithm for data filtering purposes was decided upon, for a variety of reasons. It is a \n\nwell established and widely used tool that is nowadays available in most scientific \n\ncomputation software packages (such as Mathematica or Matlab) and therefore does not \n\nhave to be specifically programmed to be used. Furthermore, Savitzky-Golay smoothing \n\nis very easy to apply and can be used to calculate inherently smoothed first and second \n\nderivatives of the signal, which is especially relevant in this context given the stated \n\nneed to calculate the slope of the transient temperature curve. \n\n0\n\n1\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nM\ne\na\nsu\nre\nd\n T\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\nTime [s]\n\nTemperature\n\nValve On-Off\n\n\n\n196 \n\n \n\nA FIR is a filter with an impulse response (or response to any finite length \n\ninput) is of finite duration, settling to zero in finite time in contrast to infinite impulse \n\nresponse (IIR) filters that may have internal feedback and continue to respond \n\nindefinitely (although usually decaying). FIR filters are inherently stable and require no \n\nfeedback, meaning that any rounding errors are not compounded by summed iterations \n\nand the same relative error occurs in each calculation. This also makes implementation \n\nsimpler, but typically comes at a higher computational cost when compared with IIR \n\nfilters. \n\nThe Savitzky\u2013Golay FIR smoothing filter essentially performs a local \n\npolynomial regression (of degree k) on a series of values (of at least k + 1 points which \n\nare treated as being equally spaced in the series) to determine the smoothed value for \n\neach point. The main advantage of this approach is that it tends to preserve features of \n\nthe distribution such as relative maxima, minima and width, which are usually \n\n'flattened' by other adjacent averaging techniques like moving averages [Savitzky and \n\nGolay 1964]. \n\nGiven a set of data containing both signal and noise, the objective of the \n\nSavitzky-Golay method is to replace the raw data by a smoother set of data \n\nrepresenting the true signal responsible for the recorded intensities. For a constant \n\nunderlying signal, the most natural means of estimating the true signal from a set of \n\nmeasurements would be to average the values. Spectral data, such as the periodic \n\ntemperature signals imposed by the transient transpiration operation, typically contain \n\npeaks superimposed on a background signal and therefore a more subtle use of \n\naveraging is required if the essential structure in the data set is to be retained.  \n\nThe smoothed time series is obtained by replacing each value of the series with \n\na new value which is obtained from a polynomial fit to 2n+1 neighbouring points \n\n(including the point to be smoothed), with n being equal to, or greater than the order \n\nof the polynomial.  \n\nIllustrated in Figure 4.23 are calculated first derivatives curves for a run with \n\nthe furnace at 1500\u00baC, where higher slope values occur. \n\n\n\n197 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.23 \u2013 Calculated first derivatives. \n\n \n\n An important conclusion was reached in the course of this experimental and \n\nanalytical process, and the graph above is helpful in making the point, since it readily \n\nindicates that a more easily measureable indication of the instrument\u2019s transient \n\nresponse can be the maximum value of the first derivative of the temperature curve, \n\nrather than its value at instant t = 0 when each airflow pulse begins and ends: \n\n \n\n \ntotal\n\nmax\n\nd\n\nd\n\nT\nq\n\nt\n?=   (4.5) \n\n \n\nThe identification of this instant t = 0 is extremely difficult for the case when \n\nthe airflow is turned off and the temperature curve rises, even at high data acquisition \n\nfrequencies (which were tested up to 500 Hz and could conceivably have been set at \n\neven higher values since the hardware allowed it) and with adequate filtering. The \n\nuncertainty associated with the specification of a particular instant for curve slope \n\ncalculation purposes would lead to significant variations in the calculated slope value \n\nand render the use of this value hazardous for calibration purposes. \n\nThis strategy can also be justified from the point of view of the data acquisition \n\nsystems available in practice, where the available hardware may not enable very high \n\n-225\n\n-175\n\n-125\n\n-75\n\n-25\n\n25\n\n75\n\n125\n\n175\n\n225\n\n275\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nC\na\nlc\nu\nla\nte\nd\n S\nlo\np\ne\n [\n\u00baC\n\ns-\n1\n]\n\nTime [s]\n\n\n\n198 \n\n \n\nacquisition frequencies. In the studies presented here, a 250 Hz acquisition frequency \n\nwas used, although in practice frequencies as low as tens of Hz can be encountered in \n\nacquisition systems deployed in industrial applications. \n\nParametric tests were performed at various transpiration mass flows (0.001, \n\n0.002 and 0.003 kgs-1) and as expected it was found that higher measured slopes are \n\nencountered at higher mass flows, leading to greater correlation coefficients in the \n\nlinear relationships between heat fluxes and measured slopes. Since greater \n\ntranspiration mass flows values not only increase the sharpness of variations but also \n\nprovide greater protection from incoming particles as mentioned earlier, transpiration \n\nmass flows should be set as high as possible and the higher tested mass flow value was \n\nsubsequently used in all tests. Furthermore, the calibration procedure was carried out \n\nusing this constant value and the fact that different calibration curves would be \n\nobtained at other values must be kept in mind. \n\nGiven the results of the 8 hour runs described above where the refrigeration \n\nairflow was shut down without any detrimental effect, the later was set at only 20% of \n\nits maximum value. \n\nSwitching the transpiration mass flow on and off will lead to two distinct \n\nsituations, the temperature rising when the airflow is shut down due to the absence of \n\nrefrigeration and the addition of an admittedly small convective component (a \u201ctotal\u201d \n\nincident heat flux thus being present) and falling when the airflow is restored, cooling is \n\npresent and convection is eliminated.  \n\nDefining an operational mode where the airflow valve is controlled by setting a \n\nmaximum temperature above which the valve opens and minimum value at which it \n\ncloses, the temperatures measured by the thermocouple will overshoot the maximum \n\nset temperature due to the inherent delay introduced by the valve-opening process, and \n\nthis overshoot will increase with increasing furnace set point temperatures. The \n\nrestoration of the airflow, which is kept constant between experiments, will likewise \n\nresult in higher cooling curve slopes for higher furnace set points, due to the greater \n\ndifference in temperature between the plate and the airflow. \n\nIn any case a linear relationship between the two aforementioned incident heat \n\nflux situations and the temperature curve slopes is expected. Given the fact that \n\n\n\n199 \n\n \n\nseveral heating and cooling cycles occur every second (with more cycles at higher \n\nfurnace temperatures given the proposed operational mode) due to the sensing \n\nelement\u2019s low thermal inertia, several slope measurements per second can be carried out \n\nfor both heating and cooling and the correspondent incident heat fluxes will be \n\ndetermined using the following relationships: \n\n \n\n \ntotal heating\n\nmax,heating\n\nd\nd\nT\n\nq\nt\n\n?=   (4.6) \n\n \n\n \nrad cooling\n\nmax,cooling\n\nd\nd\nT\n\nq\nt\n\n?=   (4.7) \n\n \n\nEquation 4.4 embodies a proportional relationship between the incoming heat \n\nflux and the slope of the transient temperature curve at the start of the pulse (hence \n\nthe zero value for time) and where the linear calibration curve has a zero intercept \n\nvalue, meaning that no slope is measured for a non-existent incoming heat flux. \n\nGiven the aforementioned difficulty in determining instant t = 0 and the \n\nproposed use of the maximum slope in each cycle, it should be kept in mind that while \n\nfor higher heat fluxes maximum slope values are expected to be reached very rapidly, \n\nslower responses are to be expected at lower incident heat flux values where the \n\nmaxima are not reached at quite the same speed, meaning that a bias resulting from \n\nthe experimental conditions can be expected to lead to non-zero intercept values. This \n\nin turn means that Equations 4.6 and 4.7 must be adapted in order to include non-zero \n\nintercepts Kheating and Kcooling:  \n\n \n\n \ntotal heating heating\n\nmax,heating\n\nd\nd\nT\n\nq K\nt\n\n?= +   (4.8) \n\n \n\n \nrad cooling cooling\n\nmax,cooling\n\nd\nd\nT\n\nq K\nt\n\n?= +   (4.9) \n\n \n\n\n\n200 \n\n \n\nThe relationships themselves can be established by determining a large number \n\nof slopes at each heat flux level and performing a standard statistical analysis of the \n\nobtained values, especially as far as their mean values and standard deviations are \n\nconcerned, allowing the determination of slope uncertainties at a given confidence \n\ninterval. This is especially relevant regarding the calibration of the instrument, as \n\ndiscussed below. \n\nPlots of mean measured slopes (calculated with 500 samples each) versus \n\nfurnace heat fluxes can be presented for each instrument, as shown in Figures 4.24 to \n\n4.29, with radiative heat fluxes corresponding to furnace set point temperatures of 1000 \n\nto 1500\u00baC, with 100\u00baC increments, as illustrated in Table 4.3 after correction with the \n\napparent emissivity described in Equation 4.2. \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 \u2013 Furnace set points for transient runs \n\nSet Point Temperature [\u00baC] qcorr [kW/m\n2] \n\n1000 45.42 \n\n1100 61.40 \n\n1200 81.42 \n\n1300 105.88 \n\n1400 135.49 \n\n1500 170.89 \n\n \n\n\n\n201 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 \u2013 Sensor 1 linear relationship between mean temperature curve slopes and furnace \n\nheat fluxes, in the heating situation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.25 \u2013 Sensor 1 linear relationship between mean temperature curve slopes and furnace \n\nheat fluxes, in the cooling situation. \n\n \n\ny = 0.4498x + 13.859\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9873\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n75 125 175 225 275 325\n\nR\na\nd\nia\nti\nv\ne\n H\n\ne\na\nt \nF\nlu\nx\n [\nk\nW\n\nm\n-2\n]\n\nSlope [Ks-1]\n\ny = -1.3472x - 355.66\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9837\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n-400 -390 -380 -370 -360 -350 -340 -330 -320 -310 -300\n\nR\na\nd\nia\nti\nv\ne\n H\n\ne\na\nt \nF\nlu\nx\n [\nk\nW\n\nm\n-2\n]\n\nSlope [Ks-1]\n\n\n\n202 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.26 \u2013 Sensor 2 linear relationship between mean temperature curve slopes and furnace \n\nheat fluxes, in the heating situation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.27 \u2013 Sensor 2 linear relationship between mean temperature curve slopes and furnace \n\nheat fluxes, in the cooling situation. \n\n \n\ny = 0.482x + 4.8714\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9796\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n75 125 175 225 275 325\n\nR\na\nd\nia\nti\nv\ne\n H\n\ne\na\nt \nF\nlu\nx\n [\nk\nW\n\nm\n-2\n]\n\nSlope [Ks-1]\n\ny = -1.1183x - 262.28\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9854\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n-400 -380 -360 -340 -320 -300 -280\n\nR\na\nd\nia\nti\nv\ne\n H\n\ne\na\nt \nF\nlu\nx\n [\nk\nW\n\nm\n-2\n]\n\nSlope [Ks-1]\n\n\n\n203 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.28 \u2013 Sensor 3 linear relationship between mean temperature curve slopes and furnace \n\nheat fluxes, in the heating situation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.29 \u2013 Sensor 3 linear relationship between mean temperature curve slopes and furnace \n\nheat fluxes, in the cooling situation. \n\n \n\nIt was hoped that the greater dimensional control of the various features of all \n\nsystem components would lead to instruments with very similar behaviours when \n\ny = 0.5504x - 15.131\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9911\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350\n\nR\na\nd\nia\nti\nv\ne\n H\n\ne\na\nt \nF\nlu\nx\n [\nk\nW\n\nm\n-2\n]\n\nSlope [Ks-1]\n\ny = -2.0375x - 589.28\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9879\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n-380 -370 -360 -350 -340 -330 -320 -310\n\nR\na\nd\nia\nti\nv\ne\n H\n\ne\na\nt \nF\nlu\nx\n [\nk\nW\n\nm\n-2\n]\n\nSlope [Ks-1]\n\n\n\n204 \n\n \n\ncompared among themselves, but Figures 4.24 to 4.29 show that although the \n\ninstruments\u2019 response is linear, albeit with admittedly perfectible correlation \n\ncoefficients, considerable differences remain between them. This renders an individual \n\ncalibration for each instrument indispensable. The main justification for the verified \n\ndifferences may be the artisanal nature of the instrument\u2019s production, namely the \n\nwelding processes that must evolve into an automated procedure if full-scale production \n\never takes place. \n\nIt should be noted that the linear equations displayed in Figures 4.24 to 4.29 are \n\nnot instrument calibration curves since no measurement uncertainties and resulting \n\ninstrument uncertainty ranges are indicated. These will be determined below where the \n\ninstrument calibration procedures are discussed, but the expected linear relationship \n\nbetween curve slopes and incident heat fluxes is nevertheless apparent. \n\nAnother interesting and expected effect given the temperature-controlled \n\noperational mode was observed regarding the magnitudes of the measured heating and \n\ncooling temperature curve slopes at the various furnace set points: each instrument also \n\ndisplays a linear relationship between the heating and cooling temperature curve slopes, \n\nas illustrated in Figures 4.30 to 4.32. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.30 \u2013 Sensor 1 linear relationship between heating and cooling temperature curve slopes. \n\n \n\ny = -0.3296x - 275.1\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9783\n\n-400\n\n-390\n\n-380\n\n-370\n\n-360\n\n-350\n\n-340\n\n-330\n\n-320\n\n-310\n\n-300\n\n75 125 175 225 275 325\n\nC\no\no\nli\nn\ng\n S\nlo\np\ne\ns \n[K\n\ns-\n1\n]\n\nHeating Slopes [Ks-1]\n\n\n\n205 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.31 \u2013 Sensor 2 linear relationship between heating and cooling temperature curve slopes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.32 \u2013 Sensor 3 linear relationship between heating and cooling temperature curve slopes. \n\n \n\nDifferences in instrument performance are clear in the obtained correlation \n\ncoefficients, Sensor 3 displaying higher correlation values while Sensor 2 visibly \n\nperforms worse than the other two.

As in other \n\ntypes of measurement, the major problem with heat flux measurement is the error \n\ncaused by the disruption due to the presence of the sensor itself.  \n\nFor sensors based on spatial temperature gradient methods, a larger signal \n\nimplies a larger temperature difference and a larger temperature disruption. For sensors \n\nbased on the transient temperature change, the surface temperature is changing while \n\nthe measurement occurs. The larger the temperature change, the easier the \n\ndetermination of the sensor heat flux, but the larger the error from the sensor \n\ntemperature disruption. The error caused by this disruption is fairly easy to estimate \n\nfor conduction but for convection, however, the effect of the surface temperature \n\ndisruption on the developing thermal boundary layer is much more difficult to estimate \n\nand the effect on the heat flux can be much larger than the percentage change of the \n\ntemperature [Robertson and Ohlemiller 1995]. It is therefore imperative, in convection \n\nmeasurements, to keep the thermal disruption of the sensor to a minimum. This is \n\nsomewhat less relevant in the case under discussion since radiation will clearly be \n\npredominant. \n\nCalibration of differential heat flux sensors can be achieved by conduction, \n\nconvection or radiation methods, either on their own or in combination. One-\n\ndimensional conduction calibration can be carried out by mounting the sensor in a good \n\nthermal insulator with known heat addition and removal at each end. Problems with \n\nthis method arise from the need of knowing the thermal conductivity of the different \n\nmaterials and also the interfacial contact resistances.  \n\n\n\n207 \n\n \n\nA well-established and therefore common laboratory method is the calibration of \n\nsensors against a well-defined convection correlation such as for jet impingement \n\n[Martin 1977]. In this technique a sensor mounted flush with the surface is exposed to a \n\nfluid jet of known geometry, velocity and temperature; the expected value of the local \n\nflux is determined from an established correlation for this geometry and for given flow \n\nconditions. This is then used for the calibration against the electrical signal from the \n\nsensor.  \n\nA variety of references exist for calibration methodologies and facilities, from \n\nsimple layered gauges [Hager et al. 1994], to round robin studies of the calibration of \n\nvarious sensors using different methods [Pitts et al. 2006] or radiative calibration \n\nprocedures of heat flux sensors [Murthy et al. 2000], including the determination of and \n\nradiative heat flux measurement uncertainty [Bryant et al. 2003]. \n\nAlso widely discussed are fire testing situations where the convective component \n\ncan be significant, rendering necessary proper heat flux partition experimental setups \n\n[Lennon and Silcock 2006]. Specific heat flux meter calibration procedures for fire \n\ntesting laboratories are also available [Filtz et al. 2002]. \n\nAlternatively, the sensor can be irradiated to a known intensity by, for example, \n\nquartz lamps. Thermal radiation sources such as a laser are well suited for the transient \n\ncalibration where a mechanical shutter can be used to modulate the heat flux. A \n\ncomprehensive review of high-temperature radiation reference sources for calibration \n\npurposes was recently published [Hartmann 2009]. \n\nAs mentioned earlier one of the problems encountered during the present study \n\nwas the cooling of the furnace inner surfaces induced by the cold transpiration airflow \n\nand the small amount of contamination coming from the lack of airtightness with the \n\nrefrigeration airflow. The problem had already been encountered in earlier transpiration \n\nradiometers\u2019 development and to the best knowledge of the author there are no \n\npurpose-developed calibration furnaces that take this problem into account, requiring \n\nkeeping it in mind when analysing results. This only compounds the problem that lies \n\nin the fact that the furnace cannot be taken as a primary calibration standard, which \n\nmeans that an uncertainty in the radiative heat flux at each furnace set point should \n\n\n\n208 \n\n \n\nalso be taken into account, namely by estimating it based on the uncertainties in the \n\nfurnace emissivity and the temperature values, as explained below. \n\n4.4.1 Calibration Procedure \n\nAs mentioned above, the calibration procedure of the instrument will involve the \n\ndetermination of the uncertainties associated with each calibration curve, i.e. the \n\nrelationship between measured slope and the heat flux to be determined. \n\nBearing in mind some of the discussion of results above, the calibration process \n\ncan be broadly described as follows: \n\n1. Mass flow and acquisition frequency are set at constant values; \n\n2. Maximum and minimum temperatures for the opening and closing of the \n\nelectrovalve controlling the transpiration mass flow are set; \n\n3. Once initial transient behaviours stabilize, data acquisition is performed;  \n\n4. Transient temperature curves are processed using Savitzky-Golay filtering; \n\n5. Mean values for the slopes at each heat flux level are calculated, together \n\nwith the respective uncertainty; \n\n6. The uncertainty in the furnace heat flux is calculated; \n\n7. Calibration curves, including uncertainties in slope and intercept, are \n\nobtained through linear regression. \n\nAs discussed above measurements were performed at an arbitrary constant \n\ntranspiration mass flow of 0.003 kgs-1, corresponding to the higher value considered in \n\nthe transient tests when various mass flows were used, since it was found, as expected, \n\nhigher measured slopes and higher correlation coefficients in the linear relationships \n\nbetween heat fluxes and measured slopes are encountered at higher mass flow rates. \n\nHigher transpiration mass flows values also provide more effective protection against \n\nincoming particles. The data acquisition frequency was likewise set at a constant value \n\nof 250 Hz, previously proven to be sufficient for the task at hand. \n\n\n\n209 \n\n \n\nMaximum and minimum temperatures for the opening and closing of the \n\nelectrovalve that controls the transpiration mass flow rate were set at 120 and 90\u00baC \n\nrespectively for tests carried out at furnace temperatures ranging between 1000 and \n\n1500\u00baC, with 100\u00baC increments. These temperatures where kept the same for all tests \n\nsince they have implications in terms of response times materialized in the number of \n\nmeasurement cycles per time unit. Higher heat fluxes lead to sharper temperature \n\nvariations, enabling faster cycles, with average cycle times ranging from 1.7 s at 1000\u00baC \n\nto 0,75 s at 1500\u00baC, using the aforementioned maximum and minimum temperatures. \n\nThis temperature interval was selected for two reasons, the least of which was \n\nproducing clear maximum slope values, which might be more difficult to identify for \n\nsmaller temperature ranges than the specified 30\u00baC, although smaller temperature \n\nintervals obviously allow faster heating and cooling cycles. \n\nThe main reason for the specified range was however providing valve opening \n\nand closing temperature values that would be common to the entire operation range, in \n\norder to establish the expected linear variation pattern. At high heat flux levels a low \n\nmeasured temperature might not be reached even after the transpiration airflow was \n\nrestored, while at lower heat flux levels the higher measured temperatures might not be \n\nreached given the fact that for temperature control safety reasons the cycle was \n\nprogrammed to always start from a situation where the transpiration airflow is on. \n\nNumerous transient temperature curves slopes were determined for calibration \n\npurposes, 500 values being used to calculate mean values and standard deviations for \n\neach furnace set point, after the aforementioned stabilization times. These mean values \n\nand respective standard deviations, together with the sample size and a specified \n\nconfidence interval (in this case, 95%), allowed the calculation of the uncertainties in \n\nthe heating and cooling slopes. The values used to calculate the slope mean values were \n\nthemselves obtained after the implementation of Savitzky-Golay filtering, as described \n\nearlier. \n\nThe aforementioned cooling of the furnace by the cold transpiration airflow \n\nmeans that the furnace cannot be taken as a primary calibration standard and renders \n\nthe quantification of the uncertainty in the radiative heat flux at each furnace set point \n\n\n\n210 \n\n \n\nnecessary, based on the uncertainties in the furnace emissivity and the temperature \n\nvalues. Writing the corrected heat flux as: \n\n \n\n 4\napp\n\nq T? ?=   (4.10) \n\n \n\nits uncertainty due to uncertainties in the temperature and the apparent emissivity can \n\nbe written as: \n\n \n\n \napp\n\n2 2\n\n2 2\nq\n\napp\nT\n\nq q\n\nT\n?\n\n? ? ?\n?\n\n? ? ? ?? ??? ???? ?= +??? ?? ? ???? ??? ? ?? ?\n  (4.11) \n\n \n\nor \n\n \n\n ( ) ( )\napp\n\n2 2\n4 2 3 2\n\nq app\n4\n\nT\nT T\n\n?\n? ? ? ? ? ?= +   (4.12) \n\n \n\nThe uncertainty in the apparent emissivity can be found in Equation 4.2, while \n\nthe uncertainty in temperature was set at 0.75% of each temperature, as per NIST \n\nreference tables [NIST 1999]. This value is for standard K-type thermocouples, rather \n\nthan the sheathed thermocouple used here, but is nevertheless a reasonable upper \n\nestimate. \n\nObtaining uncertainty values both for the furnace heat fluxes and the \n\ntemperature curve slopes enables the calculation of calibration curves by performing \n\nlinear regressions. Despite its seeming simplicity, the problem of finding the best \n\nstraight line through an experimentally determined set of points on the x-y plane has \n\ntriggered the publication of hundreds of papers in a host of fields since Gauss\u2019 original \n\ndevelopment of the method of least-squares estimation (LSE). Although the traditional \n\nregression of y on x is widely used and included in most hand calculators and \n\nspreadsheets, only rarely are the x values actually error-free. In reality, both x and y \n\nerrors may be significant, and may vary from point to point. Furthermore, the errors in \n\n\n\n211 \n\n \n\nthe two coordinates may be highly correlated, although in the present case the \n\ncorrelation was assumed to be nonexistent. \n\nThe approaches to fitting straight lines to collections of x-y data pairs can be \n\nbroadly grouped into two categories: the \u201cstandard\u201d least-squares methods in which the \n\ndistances between the fitted line and the data in the y-direction are minimized, and the \n\n\u201cbivariate\u201d least-squares methods in which the perpendicular distances between the \n\nfitted line and the data are minimized. In all of these methods, weights may be also \n\napplied to the data to account for the differing uncertainties in the individual points. In \n\n\u201cstandard\u201d least-squares, the weighting pertains to the y-variables only, whereas in \n\n\u201cbivariate\u201d methods, weights can be assigned for the x- and y-variables independently. \n\nA variety of references are available listing available linear least-squares data \n\nfitting methods [Cantrell 2008], one of the most widespread being developed by York, \n\nfirst giving the general solutions for the LSE best straight line in terms of its slope and \n\ny intercept and errors in these two parameters, when both observables (Xi, Yi) are \n\nsubject to errors which vary from point to point [York 1966]. A more general solution \n\nalso allowed for the possible correlation between the x and y errors at each point [York \n\n1968]. A compact set of equations for the slope, intercept, and standard errors was \n\nproposed [York et al. 2004] and implemented in an iterative function available at the \n\nMatlab website [Wiens 2010], used here. \n\nThis methodology enables the calculation of the same type of linear relationship \n\nbetween temperature curve slopes and heat fluxes as displayed in Figures 4.24 to 4.29, \n\nbut taking into account the aforementioned x- and y-variables uncertainties.  \n\nFigures 4.33 and 4.34 are examples of the plots resulting from the application of \n\nthe Matlab function, where the calibration curves obtained using standard least-squares \n\nestimation are compared with the method proposed by York [York et al. 2004]. The \n\nfunction represents errors in x (slope) and y (heat flux) as error bars around the mean \n\nvalues. \n\n \n\n\n\n212 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.33 \u2013 Comparison of LSE and York-method linear regressions for the heating situation \n\nin Sensor 1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.34 \u2013 Comparison of LSE and York-method linear regressions for the cooling situation \n\nin Sensor 3. \n\n \n\nRegression results, regarding parameters such as calibration curve slopes, \n\nintercepts and respective standard errors, are summarized in Table 4.4.

It should be stressed that given the experimental setup the convective \n\ncomponent of the heat flux is probably always too small to have a significant impact on \n\nmeasurements even for the heating situation where the total heat flux is received by \n\nthe sensing element. \n\n \n\nTable 4.4 \u2013 Linear regression results summary \n\n  Method Slope Error Intercept Error \n\nSensor 1 \n\nHeating \n\nLSE 0.450 - 13.859 - \n\nYork 0.479 \u00b10.015 8.423 \u00b12.076 \n\nCooling \n\nLSE -1.347 - -355.657 - \n\nYork -1.462 \u00b10.054 -394.815 \u00b117.204 \n\nSensor 2 \n\nHeating \n\nLSE 0.482 - 4.871 - \n\nYork 0.485 \u00b10.015 3.389 \u00b12.221 \n\nCooling \n\nLSE -1.118 - -262.282 - \n\nYork -1.212 \u00b10.044 -292.240 \u00b113.104 \n\nSensor 3 \n\nHeating \n\nLSE 0.550 - -15.131 - \n\nYork 0.580 \u00b10.018 -21.088 \u00b12.948 \n\nCooling \n\nLSE -2.037 - -589.282 - \n\nYork -2.062 \u00b10.089 -597.063 \u00b128.792 \n\n \n\n\n\n214 \n\n \n\nUsing the results summarized in Table 4.4, Equations 4.8 and 4.9 can be \n\nrewritten as: \n\n \n\n ( ) ( ) -2total,sensor 1\nmax,heating\n\nd\n0.479 0.015 8.423 2.076  [kWm ]\n\nd\nT\n\nq\nt\n\n= \u00b1 + \u00b1   (4.13) \n\n \n\n ( ) ( ) -2rad,sensor 1\nmax,cooling\n\nd\n1.462 0.054 394.81 17.20  [kWm ]\n\nd\nT\n\nq\nt\n\n= ? \u00b1 ? \u00b1   (4.14) \n\n \n\n ( ) ( ) -2total,sensor 2\nmax,heating\n\nd\n0.485 0.015 3.389 2.221  [kWm ]\n\nd\nT\n\nq\nt\n\n= \u00b1 + \u00b1   (4.15) \n\n \n\n ( ) ( ) -2rad,sensor 2\nmax,cooling\n\nd\n1.212 0.044 292.24 13.10  [kWm ]\n\nd\nT\n\nq\nt\n\n= ? \u00b1 ? \u00b1   (4.16) \n\n \n\n ( ) ( ) -2total,sensor 3\nmax,heating\n\nd\n0.480 0.018 21.088 2.948  [kWm ]\n\nd\nT\n\nq\nt\n\n= \u00b1 ? \u00b1   (4.17) \n\n \n\n ( ) ( ) -2rad,sensor 3\nmax,cooling\n\nd\n2.062 0.089 597.06 28.8  [kWm ]\n\nd\nT\n\nq\nt\n\n= ? \u00b1 ? \u00b1   (4.18) \n\n \n\nTrue heat flux partitioning potential is demonstrated but can only be really \n\nachieved once reliable test and calibration facilities are available. Given the \n\naforementioned lack of calibration sources that are not affected by the transpiration \n\nairflow, this means that further work is necessary regarding the facilities themselves, \n\nbesides improvements to the instruments themselves. \n\nObserved standard deviation were higher in the cooling cases and translate into \n\nabsolute higher error values in this process in comparison with the heating process, \n\nreflecting the complex interaction encountered when the transpiration airflow meets \n\nplate and thermocouple. \n\nAs mentioned above it was hoped that a precise dimensional control of the \n\ngeometric features of the various components would result in instruments with very \n\n\n\n215 \n\n \n\nsimilar behaviours when compared with each other, which could potentially make \n\nindividual calibration for each instrument indispensable. This is clearly not the case, \n\nconsiderable differences existing between instruments as materialized in the differing \n\ncalibration curve parameters, especially slopes and their uncertainties. \n\nThe linearity of the transient responses of all three instruments is nevertheless \n\nsatisfactory, as can be judged by the correlation coefficients shown in Figures 4.24 to \n\n4.29, and their reasonable accuracy was also established above for the transpiration \n\nmass flow and range of temperatures used in this particular calibration. The reason for \n\nthat undesirable behaviour, namely in an industrial production framework, was already \n\ndiscussed in a previous section. \n\nProviding a plate central zone with holes placed at a slightly greater distance \n\nfrom the thermocouple attachment point should diminish the risk of disruption of the \n\nperforated pattern while rendering the welding itself easier to execute and more robust, \n\nwithout significantly coming to the detriment of the sensor\u2019s thermal inertia. \n\nThe issue of weldings quality and variability is relevant not also from the pure \n\nthermal point of view but also in terms of overall instrument robustness. While some \n\nunits withstood all tests without any visible changes, including the two 8 hour runs, \n\none unit broke during operation (the thermocouple coming loose from the plate but still \n\nbeing capable of temperature measurements) while two others broke due to clumsy \n\nhandling, being dropped to the ground and breaking the thermocouple attachment. \n\nThese facts emphasize the need to revise the thermocouple attachment method, \n\nwhich is far from being a trivial matter given its small size, and attachment location \n\nfree space, as well as the low plate thickness. These challenging requirements led to \n\nsome unusual options that resulted in functioning prototypes with some handicaps that \n\nmust be addressed in future versions of the instrument.  \n\nFrom the analytical point of view, the fact that the calibrations above took \n\nplace at a single, arbitrary transpiration mass flow must be remembered. Now that the \n\nbasic principle is established and was shown to be viable, tests at other mass flows \n\nwould enable the establishment of a range of calibration curves for various situations \n\npotentially more suited to other possible working conditions, bearing in mind that in \n\n\n\n216 \n\n \n\nterms of transient operation sensitivity higher mass flow rates were shown to lead to \n\ngreater temperature curve slopes. \n\n4.5 Concluding Remarks \n\nThe present chapter was devoted to the description of the experimental verification and \n\ncalibration of the transient transpiration heat flux meter prototypes. \n\nThree flux meters were built and tested. A description of the constructed \n\nprototypes and of the experimental setup was presented along with a discussion of the \n\nexperimental procedure followed in the experimental study of the instrument\u2019s \n\nperformance. \n\nA reasonable agreement was found between the steady experimental data and \n\nthe numerical model predictions, despite the uncertainty regarding the sensing \n\nelement\u2019s surface emissivity. Measured steady temperatures were the same in all cases \n\nto a very small difference and the instrument output is linear with heat fluxes. Truly \n\nlong terms tests could not be performed with the available equipment but runs lasting \n\nseveral hours at high temperatures indicate a basic soundness of the design and its \n\npotential for full scale applications, despite some concerns in terms of robustness if \n\nsome changes are not introduced. \n\nA calibration procedure for the instrument\u2019s transient behaviour was described \n\nand discussed. Calibrated relationships between measured maximum temperature curve \n\nslopes and furnace heat fluxes are discussed, namely in terms of the effect of \n\nuncertainties in their magnitudes on the calibration curves. Conclusions regarding \n\noperational aspects are also presented. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n217 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\nGLOBAL CONCLUSIONS AND PROPOSED \n\nDEVELOPMENTS \n\n \n\nA summary of all the work described within this thesis is provided and \n\nthe main conclusions are listed and discussed.  Proposed developments \n\nto be carried out in the future are also presented. \n\n \n\n5.1 Summary \n\nThe present document presents a new embodiment of the transpiration radiometer \n\nprinciple, intended to maintain established features of previous instruments of the same \n\ntype while diminishing their dimensions and response time, the purpose of such \n\ninstruments remaining the measurement of the total hemispherical radiation and its \n\nseparation into radiative and convective heat fluxes being proposed.  \n\nThe proposed concept is particularly suitable and intended for high \n\ntemperature, harsh environments. The transpiration principle implies the possibility of \n\neliminating the convective component of the heat flux, hence the transpiration \n\nradiometer designation. \n\nA bibliographic review covering existing techniques heat flux measurements \n\nmade clear that no instrument exists with the particular combination of features \n\nproposed here. This assumption was embodied in a patent request and supported by \n\nthe fact that the relevant issuing organization (Instituto Nacional de Propriedade \n\nIndustrial \u2013 Portuguese National Institute of Industrial Property) approved the \n\npreliminary report, having found no impediments to patentability, and issued a \n\nprovisional patent application that must be converted into a definitive patent \n\napplication,  pending a decision to carry on by the administration of the University of \n\nAveiro, as patent co-proprietor, to be taken until August 1st, 2013 \n\n\n\n218 \n\n \n\nA chapter was devoted to the description of the instrument\u2019s working principle \n\nand of possible formulations for the study of the sensing element\u2019s behaviour.  \n\nThe problem requirements and subsequent simplifications were discussed and \n\nimplemented as necessary. The need to take into account a non-homogeneous transient \n\nproblem was foremost, especially given the presence of the interaction between a \n\nperforated plate being heated by radiation and a colder transpiration airflow crossing \n\nthe pattern of holes, leading to the analytical treatment of such an interaction as a heat \n\nsink term. \n\nThe GF method was recognized as being well suited to the task of providing an \n\nanalytical solution and a proper methodology was established in order to implement it \n\nin order to obtain temperature values for all locations and times of interest. A \n\nconcurrent finite differences approach was also found to be adequate for the same \n\npurpose, with added benefits in terms of implementation in situations where boundary \n\nconditions vary in space and time. Other relationships necessary to describe phenomena \n\nthat needed to be integrated into the model were obtained and implemented. \n\nA comparison of results of both approaches with those of equivalent CFD \n\nsimulations of the same physical problems showed good approximation and \n\nsimultaneously provided both increased confidence in the results provided by the GFSE \n\nand validation for the simulations to be carried out for dimensioning purposes using \n\nCFD software. \n\nThe dimensional and operational parameters that influence sensor performance \n\nwere determined and discussed, based both on established analytical principles and on \n\nthe simulation software that was compared to the analytical models discussed in the \n\nprevious chapter. \n\nRanges for the relevant mass flow values to be used for the intended range of \n\nfurnace working temperatures were also identified in order to guarantee the \n\nsimplification of the radiative balance between the plate and its surroundings and to \n\nensure proper boundary layer control while avoiding compressibility phenomena. The \n\ninstrument\u2019s transient behaviour was also found to be within expectations and the \n\nproposed external cooling system was likewise found satisfactory in theory. \n\n\n\n219 \n\n \n\nThe procedures developed earlier led to the building of the prototypes and \n\nprovided the framework to evaluate their performance, by comparison with simulated \n\nvalues, although necessary adjustments naturally had to be made in order to \n\naccommodate differences dictated by laboratory conditions. \n\nThree flux meters were built and tested. A description of the constructed \n\nprototypes and of the experimental setup was presented along with a discussion of the \n\nexperimental procedure followed in the experimental study of the instrument\u2019s \n\nperformance. \n\nA reasonable agreement was found between the experimental data and the \n\nnumerical model predictions, Runs lasting several hours at high temperatures indicate a \n\nbasic soundness of the design and its potential for full scale applications. \n\nA calibration procedure for the instrument\u2019s transient behaviour was described \n\nand discussed. Calibrated relationships between measured maximum temperature curve \n\nslopes and furnace heat fluxes were discussed, namely in terms of the effect of \n\nuncertainties in their magnitudes on the calibration curves. Conclusions regarding \n\noperational aspects were also presented. \n\n5.2 Conclusions \n\nThe various tasks summarized above resulted in an operational heat flux meter that \n\nwas shown to have significantly lessened dimensions, geometrical complexity and \n\nresponse times when compared with earlier transpiration radiometers. \n\n The much-reduced thermal inertia and cooling needs of the sensing element \n\ndeveloped for the present instrument furthermore enabled a switching off of the \n\ntranspiration mass flow, enabling the possibility of performing heat flux partitioning \n\ngiven the small times associated with the transient measurement cycles, meaning that \n\nsufficiently fast consecutive measurements of total and radiative heat fluxes render the \n\nestimation of the convection component by difference realistic. This feature was not \n\npresent in earlier instruments because of the refrigeration needs, which made \n\ntranspiration airflows indispensable at all times. Given the experimental setup the \n\nconvective component of the heat flux is probably always too small to have a \n\nsignificant impact on measurements, and the heat flux partitioning potential \n\n\n\n220 \n\n \n\ndemonstrated can only be really achieved once reliable test and calibration facilities are \n\navailable.  \n\nThe satisfactory linearity and accuracy displayed by the instruments can be \n\nattributed to the precise control of dimensional parameters in the sensing elements, and \n\nthe option of using such components is considered to be validated. However, it was \n\nhoped that this precise dimensional control would result in instruments with identical \n\nbehaviours when compared with each other, potentially rendering individual calibration \n\nfor each instrument necessary. This is not the case, considerable differences existing \n\nbetween instruments as materialized in the differing calibration curve parameters, \n\nespecially slopes and their respective uncertainties. \n\nThe linearity of the transient responses of all three instruments is nevertheless \n\nsatisfactory as indicated by the correlation coefficients of their regression curves, and \n\ntheir reasonable accuracy was also established for the transpiration mass flow and \n\nrange of temperatures used in this particular calibration, the uncertainties in slopes \n\nleading to less than 5% variations of their values.  \n\nBetter control and repeatability in the various welding processes would partially \n\novercome verified differences and are essential if full-scale industrial is ever to take \n\nplace, since issues regarding the quality of the weldings were identified. \n\nThe lack of quality of some weldings was first of all visible in the existence of \n\nthe contamination leakage between airflows and must also be present at the junction of \n\nthe thermocouple to the plate, where the microperforated pattern can be more or less \n\ndamaged by the welding process and change the local interaction between the \n\ntranspiration airflow and the plate, as well as the temperature distribution in the plate \n\nitself, influencing the thermocouple output and potentially causing the observed \n\ndifferences, especially during the cooling process when the airflow actually crosses the \n\nplate and causes a somewhat more erratic observed cooling process behaviour. \n\nExperience in handling of the prototypes during the testing procedures also \n\nshowed that the sensing elements are sufficiently sturdy to handle some level of \n\nmishandling without measurable harm and can withstand shocks and impacts greater \n\nthan those to be expected in aggressive high temperature environments with large \n\n\n\n221 \n\n \n\namounts of soot and dust particles. More extensive long term tests are however \n\nnecessary in order to conclude if these positive traits are retained over time. \n\nThe microperforated plate was shown to be easy to refrigerate, while initial \n\nconcerns regarding the lack of robustness both of the 0.25 mm thermocouples \n\nthemselves and their welding to the perforated plate were not wholly verified in \n\npractice, so their use can be recommended for the intended purpose. Truly long terms \n\ntests could not be performed with the available equipment but runs lasting several \n\nhours at high temperatures indicate a basic soundness of the design and its potential \n\nfor full scale applications. \n\nThe fact that most of the sensing element refrigeration actually comes from the \n\ntranspiration airflow was corroborated to a large extent by the 8 hour runs described \n\nabove, where the refrigeration airflow was shut down without any detrimental effect. \n\nThis means that the option for a porous holder can be re-examined and compared with \n\nthe possibility of providing a thin-walled holder that could be maintained at acceptable \n\ntemperatures purely by being refrigerated by the transpiration airflow, resulting in a \n\nmuch less complex and cheaper system.  \n\nCost considerations are fundamental for several reasons, both in this prototype \n\nstage and especially in possible later production versions where this academic discussion \n\nwill need to move into much more practical considerations. Possible reductions in \n\nsystem complexity such as those arising from doing without a porous holder can also \n\nhave a significant impact in terms of price and must therefore be investigated, but in \n\nany case the high unit prices and building/assembly costs encountered in the work \n\ndescribed here would be brought down by ordering larger batches of components. These \n\nreduced costs would in turn increase the likelihood of an actual operational deployment \n\nof the proposed instruments. \n\nWhile troublesome, the artisanal and perfectible welding processes used were \n\nnot an obstacle in establishing the potential of the type of proposed instrument but \n\nrather an identified area of further refinement in future improved versions. \n\nThe fact that the relevant issuing organization (Instituto Nacional de \n\nPropriedade Industrial \u2013 Portuguese National Institute of Industrial Property) issued a \n\nprovisional patent application, having found no impediments to patentability, indicates \n\n\n\n222 \n\n \n\nthe novelty of the work described here and helps putting into perspective an eventual \n\ncommercial interest in optimized and more thoroughly tested instruments of the same \n\ntype, given the potential demonstrated here. \n\n5.3 Future Developments \n\nThe work started with the present study may proceed in different directions, especially \n\nsince the developed instrument may be improved in various ways. Bearing in mind \n\nsome the conclusions discussed in each chapter and above, the following research topics \n\nare recommended for future work:  \n\n\u2022 Given the aforementioned lack of calibration sources that are not affected by \n\nthe transpiration airflow, further work is necessary regarding the calibration \n\nheat sources, besides improvements to the instruments themselves; \n\n\u2022 A calibration setup capable of adequately producing measurable convective heat \n\nfluxes usable for calibration purposes is fundamental in fulfilling the potential \n\nshown here in terms of heat flux partitioning implementation; \n\n\u2022 Truly long term testing must be carried out in order to prove the soundness of \n\nthe retained design options embodied in the present version of the instrument; \n\n\u2022 Providing a plate central zone with holes placed at a slightly greater distance \n\nfrom the thermocouple attachment point should diminish the risk of disruption \n\nof the perforated pattern while rendering the welding itself easier to execute and \n\nmore robust, without significantly coming to the detriment of the sensor\u2019s \n\nthermal inertia; \n\n\u2022 The capability to implement all necessary weldings is a reliable fashion will \n\nhave to be developed through a combination of purpose built equipment and \n\nrevised design. This is relevant in terms of building ease and reliability but \n\nespecially so in terms of operational robustness and measurement accuracy; \n\n\u2022 Crystal growth techniques such as laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) could \n\nbe used to obtain thermocouple junctions grown directly onto the intended \n\nemplacement on the microperforated plate [Feigelson 1985, Andreeta and \n\nHernandes 2010]. Such techniques are becoming more widespread and the \n\nmachinery necessary to their implementation is steadily decreasing in cost, \n\n\n\n223 \n\n \n\nrendering it potentially interesting in circumventing thermocouple welding \n\nissues; \n\n\u2022 The problems encountered in the refrigeration airflow tubing due to the hot gas \n\nblowback from the furnace also indicate that the present solution must be \n\nchanged, the most obvious solution being to change the inlet from its present \n\ntangential location to an inlet concentric (i.e. annular) with that of the \n\ntranspiration airflow, in order to let the body of the instrument provide it with \n\nthe same shielding from direct radiation; \n\n\u2022 Standard tubing dimensions and fittings should be used as much as possible, \n\nlessening some problem encountered in the present version; \n\n\u2022 The sensing element spectral sensitivity can be optimized or even tailored to \n\nspecific wavelengths both by superficial treatments for emissivity adjustment \n\nand by adjusting microperforated plate parameters such as thickness or hole \n\ndiameter and spacing; \n\n\u2022 The transient transpiration principle implemented here can be extended to more \n\ncomplex geometries besides the cylindrical components studied here, especially \n\nin systems where air cooling is already used, as is the case in the cooling of \n\nsome gas turbine blades. \n\nAll of the aforementioned points would be important both in the validation of the \n\nwork described within this document but especially as contributions to an improved \n\ncommercial version based on the design proposed herein \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n224 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n225 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n[Afgan and Leontiev 1995] N.
