SHIKANAI-YASUDA(6)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nNo vector transmitted cases of Chagas disease had been notified in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo since the 1970s. However, in March, \n2006, the death of a six-year-old boy from the municipality of Itaporanga was notified to the Center for Epidemiological Survey of the \nS\u00e3o Paulo State Health Secretariat: an autochthonous case of acute Chagas disease. The postmortem histopathological examination \nperformed in the Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas of the Botucatu School of Medicine confirmed the diagnosis. Reference to hospital records, \nconsultation with the health professionals involved in the case and interviews with members of the patient\u2019s family supplied the basis \nfor this study. We investigated parasite route of transmission, probable local reservoirs and vectors. No further human cases of acute \nChagas disease were diagnosed. No locally captured vectors or reservoirs were found infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Alternative \ntransmission hypotheses - such as the possible ingestion of foods contaminated with vector excreta - are discussed, as well as the need \nto keep previously endemic regions and infested houses under close surveillance. Clinicians should give due attention to such signs \nas uni- or bilateral palpebral edema, cardiac failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, anasarca and atypical signs of nephrotic syndrome or \nnephritis and consider the diagnostic hypothesis of Chagas disease. \n\nKEYWORDS: Acute Chagas disease; Clinical features; State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNo vector transmission of Chagas disease (CD) had been notified \nto the health authorities of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo since the mid 1970s9. \nOver the last thirty years the Control Program of the Superintend\u00eancia \nde Controle de Endemias - SUCEN (Superintendency for the Control \nof Endemic Diseases) has been adjusting its actions according to the \nextent of home triatomine infestation. Thus, the areas marked out for \nactive vector search had been gradually restricted. Active vector search \nwas finally discontinued in the year 2002. At the same time investment \nin the educational part of the Control Program was supplemented, aiming \nto stimulate residents in rural zones and the outskirts of cities under \nsurveillance to notify the occurrence of suspected insects in their homes. \nAccordingly, they are now partaking in the work of CD prophylaxis. \nSurveillance posts were installed to collect and identify the insects \ncaptured by local residents13. \n\nAs it has been a rare occurrence in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo for at least \nthree decades, acute Chagas disease (ACD) can now be a diagnostic \nchallenge for those general medical practitioners who are not familiar \nwith its signs and symptoms. Indecision and the consequent lack of \n\nprompt diagnosis tend to delay or even prevent the prescription of specific \ntreatment. Concerning epidemiological surveillance, the identification \nof an isolated occurrence is as important as that of an outbreak or an \naccidental laboratory contamination: immediate control measures are \nrequired. \n\nIn March 2006 a lethal case of ACD - a six-year-old boy from \nthe municipality of Itaporanga - was notified to the Center for \nEpidemiological Surveillance of the S\u00e3o Paulo State Health Secretariat, \nor Centro de Vigil\u00e2ncia Epidemiol\u00f3gica da Secretaria de Estado da Sa\u00fade \nde S\u00e3o Paulo (CVE-SP). Postmortem examination had established the \ndiagnosis of his condition. The municipality of Itaporanga is included \nin the XVIth Botucatu Regional Health Section. An investigation into the \ncase was initiated by a team which included epidemiological surveillance \ntechnicians from: the municipality of Itaporanga, branches of SUCEN \nbased in the municipalities of Sorocaba, Itarar\u00e9, S\u00e3o Paulo and Mogi \nGua\u00e7u, XVIth Botucatu Health Regional Section, Epidemiological \nSurveillance Group based in the municipality of Avar\u00e9, and CVE-SP. \nThe task of investigating mode of transmission, reservoirs, and vectors \ninvolved was assigned to a multi-professional team from central and \nlocal administrative levels. \n\n\n\nWANDERLEY, D.M.V.; RODRIGUES, V.L.C.C.; LEITE, R.M.; DIAZ, S.Y.; CARVALHO, M.E.; SANTOS, S.O.; TATTO, E.; CARLI, M.S.; COELHO, K.I.R.; SILVA, P.R.; T\u00daLIO, S.A.; \nSILVA, I.R. &amp; SHIKANAI-YASUDA, M.A. - On an acute case of Chagas disease in a region under vector control in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo, \n52(3):151-6, 2010. \n\n152\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nWe analyzed information kept in the records of the institutions where \nthe patient had received medical care, both as an outpatient and as an \ninpatient, in Itaporanga, Avar\u00e9 and Botucatu. We describe the consequent \nepidemiological and entomological investigation, which involved a \nsearch for triatomine vectors and potential vertebrate reservoirs in the \narea. We made house calls and had talks with members of the patient\u2019s \nfamily. From his parents, both his brothers and his grandmother (who \nlives in another house) blood samples were collected for the serological \ntests: immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and Enzyme-Linked \nImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of Chagas disease, \nwhich were performed as specified by the kit manufacturers (Immuno-\ncom, WAMA diagn\u00f3stica and Test ELISA para Chagas \u2013 BIOSChile \nrespectively). Triatomines and vertebrate reservoirs were searched for \ninside and outside the house and in the annexes. Dislodging agents \nwere applied before insecticide spraying. Light traps7 to capture adult \ntriatomines and traps intended for synanthropic as well as wild potential \nvertebrate Trypanosoma cruzi reservoirs were also set up on the \npremises10. Fluid extracted by abdominal compression from the captured \ntriatomines was used to prepare both May-Gr\u00fcnwald/Giemsa stained \nsmears to be examined for trypanosomes10 and precipitin blood meal \nidentification tests12. Giemsa stained10 blood smears from the captured \nsynanthropic and wild animals were also examined for trypanosomes. \nXenodiagnosis, using 10 insect specimens (Triatoma infestans and \nPanstrongylus megistus 4th and 5th nymphal stages) was another diagnostic \ntechnique applied to this case. \n\nRESULTS\n\n1. Clinical investigation: A six-year-old male was taken to an \nout-patient clinic in Itaporanga on February 8th, 2006. He had nausea, \nhyporexia, and cephalea. Diagnostic hypotheses: upper respiratory tract \ninfection (URTI) and helminthiasis. Ceftriaxone was prescribed and \nadministered accordingly. February 11th, 2006: new consultation, this \ntime at Nossa Senhora das Gra\u00e7as Hospital in Itaporanga. Observed: \nfever, edema, and abdominal pain. Prescribed: Dipirone and Dimethicone. \nFebruary 13th, 2006: no health improvement. The patient was taken for \nfurther consultation. Diagnosis: pharyngitis. Chest radiography failed \nto show any heart or lung problem (eventually identified in Avar\u00e9 and \nBotucatu). February 15th, 2006: emergency consultation in Itaporanga. \nRequested: chest radiography. Diagnosis: pneumonia. The patient was \nfebrile; chest radiography showed a paracardiac effusion on the right \nside and enlargement of the cardiac area. Treatment with Ceftriaxone \nwas maintained. \n\nThirteen days after the first consultation (February 21, 2006) \nemergency attention was required. Observed: facial edema and persistent \nfever (38.6 \u00baC). Body weight was increased by 2.0 kg (edema). Urinalysis, \nnormal. Hospitalization in Itaporanga: diagnostic hypotheses, nephritis \nand bronchopneumonia. Chest radiography showed progressive \nenlargement of the cardiac area. Hemogram: moderate anemia without \nleukocytosis. According to the laboratory examinations, renal function \nwas normal: BUN = 19.0 mg/dL; creatinine = 0.6 mg/dL. Antistreptolysin \nO titer (ASO) = 800 UI/mL (negative &lt;299 UI/mL). Three days \nafterwards (February 24th, 2006): urinalysis, normal. BUN increased to \n23.2 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.7 mg/dL (still within normal limits). The patient \nwas transferred to the Santa Casa hospital in Avar\u00e9. Here, laboratory \n\ntest results diverged from those previously obtained elsewhere. Now \nsevere anemia (Hb = 9.1g/dL) and left shift leukocytosis (18 600/mm\u00b3) \n(9.0%) were detected. Diagnosis: pneumonia with pleural effusion and \nrespiratory failure. Abdominal pain increased in intensity; the hypothesis \nof acute abdomen was formulated. Chest radiography: interstitial opacity \nof the right lung base (paracardiac), homogeneous opacity of the right \nlung base (pleural effusion), accentuation of the right lung hilum, and \nenlargement of the cardiac area. A routine radiography of the abdomen \nshowed a normal aspect of bone structures, anatomical images preserved, \nintestinal gases distributed as usual and no pathological calcifications \nobserved, the hypothesis of acute abdomen was ruled out.\n\nOn February 25th, 2006: thoracic fluid drainage (thoracentesis) on \nthe right side. No acid-fast or other bacilli were found in the pleural \nfluid. Oxacillin, Amicacin and Ceftriaxone were prescribed. On this \nday, the X-ray picture showed small subcutaneous emphysema and a \nthoracic tube on the right side; interstitial opacity on the right lung base \nand enlarged cardiac area. Laboratory test results on February 26th, 2006 \nshowed: creatinine = 0.8 mg/dL; BUN = 26 mg/dL; total serum protein \n= 4.2 g/dL; serum albumin = 1.7 g/dL; serum globulin = 2.5 g/dL;  \nA/G ratio = 0.7; amylase = 11U/L. According to the nurse\u2019s report, the \npatient had diarrhea and oliguria; the pleural fluid was \u201cpurulent\u201d. On \nthe following day his condition worsened: he had oliguria and dyspnea, \nwas anorectic, crying and moaning with intense abdominal pain. On \nFebruary 28th, 2006, the patient\u2019s condition was declared critical, he was \ntransferred to the Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas da Faculdade de Medicina de \nBotucatu - Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP, where hypotension \nwas observed (P\n\nsys\n = 90 mm Hg; P\n\ndias\n = 60 mm Hg).\n\nCultures of pleural fluid, blood, urine, and feces showed negative \nresults. March 2nd, 2006: the echocardiogram showed slight hypertrophy \nand moderate systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV); pericardial \neffusion and moderate to serious mitral insufficiency. Treatment for heart \nfailure was started. An investigation was initiated into the etiology of \nthe myocarditis. The child was pronounced dead on March 7th, 2006, 27 \ndays after the first consultation. \n\nNecroscopical examination established the diagnosis of ACD. \nConsequential causes: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, ascitis (200 mL, \ncitrine-yellow), chronic passive pulmonary congestion. Terminal cause: \nheart failure. Serological tests (ELISA and passive hemagglutination \nfor the diagnosis of ACD) performed postmortem (on March 14th, \n2006) were positive. The results of the same tests, applied to relatives \nof the patient (mother, father, grandmother, and two brothers) were \nnegative. Heart histological sections showed T. cruzi amastigote \u201cnests\u201d, \ninflammatory mononuclear infiltrate and sparse granulomatous structures \nin the interstitial spaces. The cardiac fibers showed diffuse alteration, \nvascular congestion interstitial and interfibrillar edema; agglomeration of \namastigotes. Mononuclear infiltration, mainly composed of lymphocytes \nand plasma cells. Myofibers, predominantly dissociated were observed \n\n2. Epidemiological investigation: Our epidemiological investigation \nincluded domiciliary visits to the relatives of the deceased patient. \nAccording to them, he was delivered normally in a hospital maternity \nward. His height and weight had been normal for his age and he was \nperiodically examined at a public Health Center in the municipality, \nregularly receiving milk. There were no records of past illness, blood \ntransfusion or hospitalization. \n\n\n\nWANDERLEY, D.M.V.; RODRIGUES, V.L.C.C.; LEITE, R.M.; DIAZ, S.Y.; CARVALHO, M.E.; SANTOS, S.O.; TATTO, E.; CARLI, M.S.; COELHO, K.I.R.; SILVA, P.R.; T\u00daLIO, S.A.; \nSILVA, I.R. &amp; SHIKANAI-YASUDA, M.A. - On an acute case of Chagas disease in a region under vector control in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo, \n52(3):151-6, 2010. \n\n153\n\nHis family had been living for seven months in a wooden house \nwith poor standards of hygiene and frequent contact with animals in \nits periphery. It was impoverished and dysfunctional (a chronically \nalcoholic father and a mother suffering from depression). In addition to \nthe deceased, his parents and two brothers, aged one and seven, occupied \nthe family house. They had previously lived on a farm in the municipality \nof Salto de Pirapora. No records of blood transfusion or hospitalization \nof this patient could be found in the Health Centers of Salto de Pirapora \nor Votorantim, which his family had access to. \n\nAs stated by the deceased patient\u2019s father, a \u201cbarbeiro\u201d (\u201ccone-\nnosed bug\u201d, Hemiptera: Reduviidae), which had fallen from the roof \nof the family house during the day, was captured at the beginning of \nFebruary, 2006, and duly notified to the health authorities on February \n20th, 2006. According to the patient\u2019s mother, she had, less than 30 days \nearlier, captured another \u201cbarbeiro\u201d specimen in his bed. That insect was \neventually destroyed. In spite of his age, the boy still sucked a pacifier \nand remained frequently in bed for long periods and complained of leg \npain. He liked to eat raw vegetables, but had been losing his appetite for \nabout a year, was rather aggressive, introverted, and easily tired when \nplaying with other children. His grandfather died of CD more than 20 \nyears ago and one of his uncles has also been infected. \n\nXenodiagnosis was applied to three members of the family (with the \nexception of the one-year-old child) which came out negative.\n\nA nationwide serologic survey is now applied to children five-years-\nold or younger in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. It includes the municipality of \nItaporanga. One of the localities selected is in the proximity of that where \nthe family of the deceased patient lived. From a sample of 356 sera, none \nproduced positive results (personal communication, Prof. Alejandro O. \nLuquetti-UFGO, Goi\u00e2nia, GO, Brazil). \n\n3. Entomological investigation: The triatomine specimen captured \nby the deceased boy\u2019s family and notified to the local health authorities on \nFebruary 20th, 2006, was identified as Panstrongylus megistus, negative \nfor T. cruzi. A consequence of this finding was an exhaustive search for \ntriatomines inside the house and in the surrounding area; no triatomines \nwere found. \n\nThe family house is made of wooden planks (Fig. 2), and has marks \nof the permanence of such domestic animals as poultry, ducks, pigs, \ndogs, and cows in its periphery, where their feces accumulated. Inside \nthe house mice tracks were visible. The family declared that, after the \ndeath of their child, the Social Promotion Sector of the Municipality \nassisted them in cleaning the house and clearing the surrounds of weeds. \nThey have also sprayed insecticides as recommended. A new exhaustive \nentomological investigation included spraying the house with alpha-\nCypermethrin preceded by the application of a dislodging agent (Pirisa). \nAnother investigation was made in this area after a period of three months. \nLight traps were set up to capture triatomines in the surrounds of a house \nwhere the deceased boy\u2019s family had stayed for about 30 days during the \nmonth of August 2005. No triatomines were found.\n\n4. Situation of the entomological surveillance for Chagas disease \nin the municipality of Itaporanga, state of S\u00e3o Paulo: The municipality \nof Itaporanga is located in the Southwest of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil \n(23\u00b042\u201924\u201dS, 49\u00b029\u201924\u201dW). It is included in the Governmental Region \nof Avar\u00e9 (an administrative subdivision of the state), in the homogeneous \nMicro-Region of Campos de Itapetininga, a subdivision of the former. \nFive infected specimens of Triatoma infestans had been captured here \nin the year 1978, while the last capture of T. infestans (one specimen) in \nthe Municipality of Itaporanga dates back to 1974. Since then, very few \nspecimens of P. megistus have been found in human domiciles, some of \nthem naturally infected. During the 1980s, triatomine infestation reached \nextremely low levels in Itaporanga. The year 1988 marked the last \nextensive search for triatomines in houses and their surroundings. Not a \nsingle specimen was captured during that year. Since then, entomological \nsurveillance has been maintained by encouraging local people to notify \nthe health authority or the local school, of the presence of any insect \nsuspected of being a \u201cbarbeiro\u201d. It should be emphasized that, in the \nlocality where the deceased patient had his residence, the capture of a \nfemale specimen of P. megistus (negative for T. cruzi infection) had been \nnotified. On March 8, 2006 the consequent search for triatomines was \nnegative. No triatomine species were found.\n\nFrom the year 2000 onwards, P. megistus has been the only species \ncaptured in the municipality of Itaporanga (95.2% inside houses), \n\nFig. 1 - Intracellular Trypanosoma cruzi (amastigota \u201cnest\u201d) inside myocardial fibers. \nInflammatory reaction.\n\nFig. 2 - Home of the deceased ACD patient, in the rural zone of Itaporanga, SP, Brazil.\n\n\n\nWANDERLEY, D.M.V.; RODRIGUES, V.L.C.C.; LEITE, R.M.; DIAZ, S.Y.; CARVALHO, M.E.; SANTOS, S.O.; TATTO, E.; CARLI, M.S.; COELHO, K.I.R.; SILVA, P.R.; T\u00daLIO, S.A.; \nSILVA, I.R. &amp; SHIKANAI-YASUDA, M.A. - On an acute case of Chagas disease in a region under vector control in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo, \n52(3):151-6, 2010. \n\n154\n\ninfected (15.5%); these have been isolated specimens, without formation \nof colonies (Table 1). \n\nThe two triatomine specimens captured inside houses during the \nperiod from 2001 to 2003 had precipitin tests positive for human blood. \nThose specimens captured more recently had only bird and dog blood \nidentified as ingested. According to the entomological norms in force \nat that occasion in the Control Program of Chagas disease - Programa \nde Controle da Doen\u00e7a de Chagas - PCDCh, all the residents of a \nhouse where an infected triatomine had been captured should undergo \nserological tests for T. cruzi infection, to ascertain the consequences of the \noccurrence of infected vectors in a human dwelling. Serological tests of \nthe inhabitants of the municipality of Itaporanga, during the periods from \n1984 to 1988 and from 1990 to 1993, showed a total of 12.06% positive \nresults. Remarkably, none of the positive tests were observed in people \naged 15 years or younger2. The serological data in the later years 2001 \nand 2002, consisted of, respectively, six and 10 blood samples and one \nseropositive in each year, both belonging to the age group 51 to 60 years. \n\n5. Reservoir investigation: Before spraying the place with dislodging \nagents, a comprehensive investigation into the possible occurrence of \nvertebrate animal reservoirs was made in the area. Traps were installed for \nthe capture of wild animals known to be potential reservoirs of T. cruzi. \nThis resulted in the capture of two specimens of Didelphis albiventris. \nFresh and stained blood smears, in addition to xenodiagnosis, were all \nnegative for flagellate forms of T. cruzi. A specimen of Rattus rattus was \nshown to be positive for Trypanosoma (Herpetosoma) lewisi, observed \nin fresh blood smears. This protozoon strain was isolated by inoculation \nin laboratory mice (Wistar).\n\n6. General orientation: The Health Service personnel were \ninstructed to keep a record of every bit of information about cases of \nfever in the families when collecting insects reported by householders of \nItaporanga inhabitants. Notifiers were told to be alert to the emergence \nof symptoms (especially fever) in any member of their families during \nthe 90 days following notification. Furthermore, they should look for \nmedical service and make known the discovery of blood-sucking insect/s \nin their homes. \n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFollowing the Control Program of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (PCDCh) \nnorms, the specific duties under the responsibility of SUCEN should \nbe aimed at the control of vector triatomines. Upon the detection of T. \ninfestans specimens in the human domicile, a serological investigation \nof the local residents should be made. Regarding the occurrence of \nother vector species, this investigation will depend only on the indoor \ndetection of vectors with ingesta identified as human blood and infected \nwith T. cruzi. In the high plateau of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, as a whole, \nno reagent cases have been found among young people4, considering \nthe current conditions for performing serological tests in population \nsamples. The same is not true for the littoral5. In the neighborhood of \nItaporanga CD was still prevalent in the six years or over age group in \n1976. This explains the concern for diagnosing congenital CD infection \nin the female seroreagent group3. \n\nSerological tests for CD applied to the inhabitants of Itaporanga \nbetween the years 1976 and 1978 produced 19.22% positives - confidence \ninterval 95% of the\n\n \npositives = 17.27 to 21.34 out of a total of 1,441 \n\nsamples from four localities2. In the 2-to-29-year-old age-group 42.23% \nof the cases are clustered, which indicates a problem of CD transmission \nin this area. It is important to note that Itaporanga was included in the \nproject of serological survey among school-children in the first series \nof the fundamental classes. That survey, made between 1973 and 1983, \ncomprised 54 municipalities of different regions of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. \nThe proportions of positives were 14.0% and 8.4% in 1973 and 1974 \nrespectively, and decreased with the passage of time until they reached \nthe values of 0.9% and zero per cent in 1982 and 1983, respectively2. \n\nIn Itaporanga, seroreactivity results have now reached values \ncomparable to those characteristic of past infection, in spite of the fact \nthat infected P. megistus specimens have been observed. The occurrence \nof this species infected with T. cruzi has been detected6; thus, vigilance is \nmaintained in many areas of the state13. On every occasion that an insect \nis notified, SUCEN promotes cautious observation of the area mentioned, \n(attendance to notification) in search of vector foci and colonies11. \n\nIn spite of all caution we were compelled to report the occurrence of \nan ACD case in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: a previously healthy six-\nyear-old child, resident in the rural zone of Itaporanga, manifested clinical \nsigns and symptoms compatible with those of ACD, such as continuous \nfever, leg and face edema, intense abdominal pain, myocardiopathy, and \neventually heart failure. \n\nAs the semiological techniques used failed to identify the etiology \nof the disease, the patient did not receive the specific treatment. \nThe etiological diagnosis of this case was the result of postmortem \nhistopathological and parasitological examinations performed at least \n27 days after the first medical consultation. \n\nProbable contact with the triatomine specimen found by the patient\u2019s \nmother on his bed (destroyed without having been examined), could \npossibly have caused the infection through his eyelid mucosa or small \nquantities of triatomine excreta might have been ingested, accepting the \nhypothesis that the insect was, in fact, infected. According to estimates \nof incubation periods of Chagas disease (three to 22 days for oral \ntransmission, and five to 15 days for vectorial transmission), contact \n\nTable 1\nTriatomine capture in the municipality of Itaporanga, SP, Brazil,  \n\nfrom 2000 to 2006\n\nYEAR Panstrongylus megistus \ncollected\n\nPanstrongylus megistus \ninfected\n\nIntra Peri Intra Peri\n\n2000 12 - 1 -\n\n2001 9 - 1 -\n\n2002 14 2 5 -\n\n2003 19 - 3 -\n\n2004 8 - 1 -\n\n2005 8 1 1 -\n\n2006 14 1 1 -\n\nSource: SUCEN/DCV/NIT, 2009.\n\n\n\nWANDERLEY, D.M.V.; RODRIGUES, V.L.C.C.; LEITE, R.M.; DIAZ, S.Y.; CARVALHO, M.E.; SANTOS, S.O.; TATTO, E.; CARLI, M.S.; COELHO, K.I.R.; SILVA, P.R.; T\u00daLIO, S.A.; \nSILVA, I.R. &amp; SHIKANAI-YASUDA, M.A. - On an acute case of Chagas disease in a region under vector control in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo, \n52(3):151-6, 2010. \n\n155\n\nwith the triatomine specimen which was notified could have caused the \ninfection. However, in this case the route of infection of T. cruzi would \nbe difficult to trace. Vectorial transmission should not be ruled out \naltogether, as an infected specimen of P. megistus had been captured in \nthe municipality of Itaporanga in the year 2006. However, this hypothesis \nis based on the slimmest evidence. The hypothesis of oral contamination \nwas considered remote as the other members of the patient\u2019s family, who \nshared the same sources of nutrients (father, mother, and brothers), were \nnot demonstrated to be infected. \n\nThis case history exposes the difficulty that a clinician may \nexperience in trying to act promptly to diagnose a case of ACD, even in \nthe environment of a tertiary-level hospital. Recent and well documented \noutbreaks of trypanosomiasis resulting from oral contamination, exhibited \nsome manifestations which until recently would have been considered \nunusual. It is evidently necessary to adopt new definitions for suspected \ncases of ACD to enable clinicians to reach without delay the correct \ndiagnosis, so that the specific treatment can be promptly started. \n\nIn addition to the classic definitions of the acute disease1, fever \npersisting for more than five days, adenomegaly with hepatosplenomegaly, \nbilateral edema of the eyelids, edema of the extremities, exanthema, \nmyocarditis and meningoencephalitis, the inclusion of such signs \nas suspected glomerulonephritis with a normal urinary sediment, \npericarditis, cardiac failure with or without pleural effusion, icterus \nwithout apparent cause, associated with fever; anasarca without urinary \nor cardiac dysfunction, associated with fever; fever without any apparent \nfocus in patients with such positive epidemiological data as direct contact \nwith triatomines or with food contaminated with their excreta should \nbe investigated. \n\nAlthough associated with a great number of symptoms, ACD has \nnot been a diagnostic hypothesis as frequently as should be reasonably \nexpected. Now, the most important vector of CD is under control \nin Brazil8, but there have been many recent reports of probable oral \ntransmission. The acute phase of CD is characterized by very high \nconcentrations of trypomastigotes in the peripheral blood. Thus, the live \nparasite is readily identified in fresh blood samples. This is a simple, \nefficient, rapid and inexpensive means, highly recommended for the \nidentification of the etiological agent of CD. In case of positive result, \nimmediate specific treatment should be prescribed. This case history \nemphasizes the importance of the maintenance of the program of active \nsurveillance and the inclusion of areas where the vector is already under \ncontrol. We suggest the creation of two levels of control. Level One: \ncontrol of triatomines, which will count upon the cooperation of the \ncommunity and surveillance institutions; selection of techniques sensitive \nenough to detect new, scarcely evident triatomine colonies. Immediate \nnotification of positive cases to the Health Units. Level Two: training \nof Health Teams should be adequately updated to permit a prompt \nidentification of suspected cases of ACD, even when the patients are \ncoming from a region where the vector control has been considered \nsuccessful for the last decades. We aim to avoid misdiagnosis and the \nworsening of a patient\u2019s condition towards an otherwise avoidable death.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nDalva Marli V.

Em mar\u00e7o de 2006 a Vigil\u00e2ncia \nEpidemiol\u00f3gica registrou \u00f3bito por doen\u00e7a de Chagas aguda, em \nItaporanga, de paciente de seis anos de idade. Exame histopatol\u00f3gico post \nmortem realizado no Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas da Faculdade de Medicina de \nBotucatu confirmou o diagn\u00f3stico. Consultamos prontu\u00e1rios de hospitais \ne entrevistamos profissionais de sa\u00fade envolvidos al\u00e9m de familiares do \npaciente. Descrevemos medidas adotadas in loco para identificar a via \nde transmiss\u00e3o, reservat\u00f3rios e vetores. Discutimos as poss\u00edveis fontes \nde infec\u00e7\u00e3o. Na regi\u00e3o n\u00e3o foram identificados outros casos humanos, \nvetores ou reservat\u00f3rios vertebrados infectados por Trypanosoma cruzi. \nSalientamos a import\u00e2ncia de manter a vigil\u00e2ncia, mesmo em \u00e1reas onde \na transmiss\u00e3o de doen\u00e7a de Chagas est\u00e1 interrompida e naquelas ainda \ninfestadas por triatom\u00edneos. Deve-se admitir a hip\u00f3tese diagn\u00f3stica de \ndoen\u00e7a de Chagas quando observados: edema palpebral (uni ou bilateral), \ninsufici\u00eancia card\u00edaca, miocardite, pericardite, anasarca, quadros \nsimilares aos de s\u00edndrome nefr\u00f3tica ou glomerulonefrite sem causas \noutras aparentes, em pacientes com dados epidemiol\u00f3gicos positivos. \nEncontro, mesmo em raras ocasi\u00f5es, de triatom\u00edneos na regi\u00e3o ou ainda \ncontato com alimento contamin\u00e1vel com formas infectantes de T. cruzi. \n\nREFERENCES\n\n 1.
