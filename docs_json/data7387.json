Such residues, called \noily sludge, are basically composed of oil, water, \nsolids, and their characteristics, such as varied \ncomposition, make their reutilisation very difficult, \nand confer on them high recalcitrance. Moreover, \nincineration of this residue is not recommended \ndue to high energy costs, the potential risk of air \npollution and the persistence of PAHs (Ururahy et \nal., 1998). Thus studies must be carried out aiming \n\nthe improvement of the current suitable \ntechnologies or the development of new ones. \nThe landfarming system is the most world-wide \nknown technology used to treat the oily sludge. \nThis system is designed to ensure the aerobic \nbiodegradation of the residue in the soil superficial \nlayer (Kataoka, 2001). However, this technology \ndemands long process times and large areas and \nthere is a potential risk of groundwater \ncontamination if the landfarming is not well \nconstructed. \nDue to the low biodegradation efficiency observed \nin the treatments where the oily sludge is mixed \nwith soil (landfarming, biopile, and composting) \n \n\n\n\nCrivelaro, S. H. R. et al.  \n\nBraz. Arch. Biol. Technol. v.53 n.5: pp. 1217-1224, Sept/Oct 2010 \n\n1218\n\n(Bossert et al., 1984; Mishra et al., 2001; Juteau et \nal., 2003; Ayotamuno et al., 2007;  Mach\u00edn-\nRam\u00edrez et al., 2008), nutritional amendment is \none of the possibilities to tackle this problem \n(Brown1   Hahn and Loehr, 1992; Chokshi and \nNelson, 2003; Mrayyan and Battikhi, 2004). \nAccording to Ururahy et al. (1998), oily sludges \npossess limited amounts of nitrogen and \nphosphate, and most of the nitrogen is not \navailable, since it is part of complex structures, \nrelatively inaccessible to microorganisms.  \nIn Brazil, it is very common to dispose vinasse (a \nby-product of the alcohol distillation process with \nfertilisation characteristics) in agricultural fields, a \nprocess called ferti-irrigation, as a partial or total \nsubstitute for mineral fertilisers, mainly potassium. \nIn general, to produce one litre of alcohol, 10 to 15 \nlitres of vinasse are produced, depending on sugar \ncane quality and the industrial process (Cortez et \nal., 1992), which corresponds to approximately \n170 billion litres per year of this residue in Brazil \n(Agrianual, 2004). \nConsidering that the ethanol production in Brazil \nis in expansion due to a rising internal and world-\n\nwide demand for alternative energy sources and \nthat soils have a limited support capability to \nreceive the vinasse, the search for additional \napplication for the vinasse is very important. Thus, \nthis work evaluated the potential use of vinasse as \na biostimulation agent for the biodegradation of \noily sludge in soil.  \n \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nOily sludge and vinasse characteristics \nThe oily sludge was obtained from \nReplan/Petrobras oil refinery (Paulinia/SP/Brazil) \nprior to its disposal in the landfarming system. \nVinasse was collected at Usina Am\u00e9rica \n(Assis/SP/Brazil). Tables 1 and 2 show the \nphysicochemical characteristics of the oily sludge \nand vinasse, respectively. The analyses were \nperformed by Icasa laboratory (Instituto \nCampineiro de An\u00e1lise de Solo e Adubo \u2013 Icasa), \naccording to the methodology proposed by \nEmbrapa (1997). \n\n \nTable 1 - Oily sludge characteristics. \n\nN % 0.53 \ntotal P (P2O5) % 0.0908 \n\nK K2O (%) 0.025 \nCa % 0.29 \nMg % 0.11 \nS % 0.32 \nFe % 0.69 \nMn % 0.0138 \nCu % 0.00275 \nZn % 0.0683 \nB % 0.005 \nNa % 0.13 \nCo % 2.50 \nMo % -a \nAl % 0.71 \nBa % 0.005211 \nCd % 0.000028 \nCr % 0.005781 \nNi % 0.001414 \nPb % 0.001323 \n\nmoisture 65oC % 80.86 \nmoisture 105oC % 81.33 \norganic matter % 63.85 \n\nashes % 36.15 \ndensity g/mL 1.03 \n\nC/N ratio  66.93 \npH  7.20 \n\na not detected. \n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of the Use of Vinasse as a Biostimulation Agent \n\nBraz.

Until performing \nthe biodegradation experiment, the samples were \nstored at 5 oC. Table 3 summarises some \nphysicochemical characteristics of the soil sample. \nThe physicochemical analyses were performed by \nIcasa laboratory according to the methodology \nproposed by Embrapa (1997). In order to verify \nthe influence of the vinasse in the biodegradation \nof the oily sludge, a batch biodegradation \nexperiment (121 days) was carried out in Bartha \nbiometer flasks (250 mL) used to measure the \nmicrobial CO2 production (Bartha and Pramer, \n1965; R\u00e9gis and Bidoia, 2005; Inazaki et al., 2004; \nMariano et al., 2008a-c and 2009b).  \nTable 4 shows the treatments simulated in the \nrespirometric experiments. The quantity of water \n\nor vinasse added to adjust the soil moisture to \n64.2% of the soil field capacity was 0.11 mL/g dry \nsoil. For each treatment, the biometer flasks were \nprepared in triplicates (3 x 50 g of soil) and \nincubated at 27 oC in the dark. The CO2 produced \nwas trapped in a 10.0 mL solution of KOH (0.2 \nN), located in the side-arm of the biometer. This \nsolution was periodically withdrawn by syringe, \nand the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed was \nthen measured by titrating the residual KOH [after \nthe addition of barium chloride solution (1 mL; 1.0 \nN) used to precipitate the carbonate ions] with a \nstandard solution of HCl (0.1 N). During this \nprocedure, the biometers were aerated for 1.5 \nminute through the ascarite filters. At the end of \nthe experiment, replicates of each treatment were \nthoroughly mixed together for microbiological \nanalysis. \n\n \n \nTable 3 - Soil characteristics. \n   (mmolc/dm3) \npH (CaCl2) 4.1 Ca 8.0 \norganic matter (%) 0.5 Mg 5.0 \nP  (%)  0.0003 Al 21.0 \nmoisture (%) 12.0 K 0.6 \nfield capacity (g H2O/g soil) 0.36   \ngrain size distribution   (%) \n\nsand 47.2   \nsilt 22.7   \nclay 30.1   \n\nmicronutrients (%) \n\nS Na Fe Mn Cu Zn B \n\n0.001 0.0007 0.0004 0.00011 0.00001 0.00007 0.000048 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nCrivelaro, S.

The plate \ncounts were performed as follows: samples of 1 g \nof soil were added to 9 mL of 0.85 % sterile saline \nsolution in test tubes and agitated mechanically for \n2 minutes. After appropriate serial dilutions, 1 mL \nof the suspension were spread over the surface of \nduplicate petri dishes and incubated for 48 h at 35 \noC (bacteria) or 28 oC (fungi). The total \nheterotrophic bacteria count was carried out at the \nbeginning and at end of the respirometric \nexperiment. \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nThe daily CO2 productions in the respirometric \nexperiment are represented in Figures 1 to 3, \nwhere each error bar represents one SD (standard \n \n\ndeviation) of three replicates. The evolution of the \nCO2 production in treatment 2 (soil + vinasse) \n(Fig. 1) showed that the vinasse was practically \ntotally biodegraded in approximately 40 days after \nbeing applied to the soil. When considering the \ntreatments with oily sludge and vinasse (Fig.2 and \n3), a similar behaviour was observed, i.e. the CO2 \nproduction in the treatments with vinasse initially \ndifferentiate from the controls and after similar \nperiod (40 days), it decreased until reaching values \nnext to the controls. Thus, since there was no \ndifference between the CO2 produced from the \ntreatments with or without vinasse after the \ncomplete consumption of the vinasse, it showed \nthat the vinasse did not biostimulate the \nbiodegradation of the oily sludge at the \nmineralization level. It is important to emphasise \nthat mineralization studies involving \nmeasurements of total CO2 production can provide \nexcellent information on the biodegradability \npotential of hydrocarbons (Balba et al., 1998). \n \n\n \n \n \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\ntime (days)\n\nC\nO\n\n2\n p\n\nro\nd\n\nu\nc\ne\nd\n\n (\n\u00b5\n\nm\no\n\nl.d\n-1\n) (1) - soil\n\n(2) - soil + vinasse\n\n \nFigure 1 - CO2 production for treatments 1 and 2. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nEvaluation of the Use of Vinasse as a Biostimulation Agent \n\nBraz.

In almost all counts, the \ntreatments with vinasse had a microbial population \ngreater at the final time than the controls without \nvinasse. The exception was verified in the total \nheterotrophic bacteria count for treatments with an \noily sludge concentration of 7 % (treatments 3 and \n4, Fig. 5). It indicated that generally vinasse had a \npositive effect on the soil microbial population, \novercoming the toxicity of the oily sludge that \ncould have negative effects on the microbiot, as \nobserved by Mielniczuk (1991). \n\nThe increase in the soil microbial population \ncaused by the vinasse was also observed by Prata \net al. (2001) and Mariano et al. (2009a) in their \nbiodegradation experiments. However, as \nobserved by Hickman and Novak (1989), the total \nmicrobial biomass could be a poor predictor for \ndetermining the biodegradation potential, mainly \nbecause the active biomass could differ in species \ncomposition and in metabolic regimes. Certainly \nthese additional microorganisms preferentially \nbiodegraded the more labile carbon sources as the \nglycerol present in the vinasse (Rodella et al., \n1983; Prata et al., 2001); otherwise, a marked \ndecrease in the CO2 production after the \nconsumption of the vinasse would not be \nobserved. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCrivelaro, S.
