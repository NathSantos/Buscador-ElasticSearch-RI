Non-\ncynodont remains are restricted to a single specimen of Rhadinosuchidae (Archosauriformes: Proterochampsia).\nThe taphocoenosis is characterized by the chaotic accumulation of tens of isolated fossil bones within a block of\nmudrock 10 m wide and 20 m long, and approximately 5 m thick. The site lies within an approximately 30 m\nthick succession of red mudstone displaying horizons of rhizoliths and carbonate nodules which are interpreted\nas palaeopedogenic carbonate precipitation in alluvium on a semi arid floodplain. Preservation of the fossil bones\nat this site is unusually good. Microstructure of the bones shows external and internal precipitation of calcite and\nquartz in the vessel cavities and pores in the bone matrix indicating that they were initially filled by calcite, and\nthan partially replaced by quartz. These features combined with the presence of calcareous rhizoliths and\ncarbonate nodules, suggest that the bones were accumulated on a playa lake margin with the position of the\nshoreline being controlled by the groundwater table movements between dry and wet seasons. The taphocoenosis\nshows a predominance of disarticulated and disassociated skulls and mandibles. Commonly large and very small\nbones occur side-by-side with no preferred orientation. This taphonomic style suggests a biogenic agent of\nconcentration of the bones by selective predation.\n\nKey words: Biogenic concentration, floodplain, Triassic, vertebrate taphonomy.\n\nRESUMO \u2013 Perto da cidade de Santa Cruz do Sul (regi\u00e3o central do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil), um afloramento\nTri\u00e1ssico da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Santa Maria apresenta uma assembl\u00e9ia f\u00f3ssil bastante incomum, consistindo de uma\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de restos esqueletais de ter\u00e1psidos desarticulados, com predom\u00ednio de ossos de cinodontes herb\u00edvoros\ne carn\u00edvoros.

However, the genesis of such concentrations is often\npoorly researched or not considered at all. Taphonomic\nprocesses such as scavenging, predation, trampling, fluvial\ntransportation and re-working of organic remains all leave\ntheir taphonomic signature on the fossil assemblage\n(Turnbull &amp; Martill, 1988). Thus, to fully understand the\npalaeoecological significance of the fossil assemblage such\nevents must be adequately investigated as part of a detailed\ntaphonomic analysis. This study concerns a fossil bone\naccumulation in the Triassic portion of the Paran\u00e1 Basin of\nsouthern Brazil. This very large intracratonic basin of\nsouthwestern Gondwana, was intermittently active from the\nLate Ordovician to early Cretaceous. It is NE-SW orientated\nand is approximately 1,750 km long and 900 km wide, covering\nan area of 1,700,000 km2 (Figure 1A).\n\nThe basin formed after the Brasiliano Cycle (the Brazilian\ntectonic equivalent for the coming together of Gondwana\nduring Proterozoic) with plutonic events (610-580 m.y.) and\nsubsequent cooling and thermal subsidence in Cambro-\nOrdovician times (500-450 m.y.). During the middle Mesozoic,\n\npreceding the opening of the South Atlantic, the Paran\u00e1 Basin\nunderwent tectonic reorganization due to the paroxysm of\nthe Sierra de la Ventana-Cape Fold Belt orogen. This\ntectonism resulted in uplift of large areas of the former Paran\u00e1\nBasin, leading to intraplate rifting and the formation of several\nsmall extensional basins (Zerfass et al., 2003, 2004). Our study\nfocuses on the red-bed type sediments (Figure 2) that\naccumulated in one of these restricted extensional basins\nduring the Middle Triassic. They form part of the Santa Maria\nFormation (sensu Andreis et al., 1980) that crops out in Rio\nGrande do Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil (Figure 1B).\nThis formation has two members, called Passos das Tropas\nand Alemoa. The conglomerates of the Passo das Tropas\nMember have not yielded any fossil vertebrates to date.\n\nThe Alemoa Member contains the study site and is\ncharacterized by large amounts of tabular, massive or thinly\nlaminated red coloured mudstones with calcitic palaeosol\nhorizons ( i.e., rhizoliths and carbonate nodules) and some\ninterfingering sandstone lenses. Fonseca (1999) attributes\nthese deposits to an anastomosed fluvial system, where the\nmudstones (associated with calcrete nodules) were deposited\non the floodplain while the sandstone lenses represent in-\nchannel deposits.\n\nMiddle Triassic tetrapod faunas mainly comprise\narchosaurs, dicynodonts, cynodonts, rhynchosaurs, besides\nless well represented groups like procolophonids and\nsphenodontids (e.g., Schultz, 1990; Rubert &amp; Schultz, 2004).\n\nMost of the paleontological record of Rio Grande do Sul\nTriassic rocks shows some kind of biostratinomic or\ndiagenetic modification, including hydraulic selection of\nbones, scavenger action and diagenetic \u201cexplosion\u201d and re-\ncementation (e.g., Holz &amp; Barberena, 1994; Holz &amp; Schultz,\n1998; Holz &amp; Souto-Ribeiro, 2000).\n\nDuring taxonomic analysis, Abdala et al. (2001) noted\nthat the taphocoenosis of a section located at Santa Cruz do\nSul city, in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul State, is\nvery peculiar because of the large number of cynodont skulls\nand lower jaws found in these massive red mudstones. We\nhave investigated this peculiar location, known as the\nSchoenstatt outcrop, and have confirmed the findings of\nAbdala et al. (2001) that unlike other fossiliferous outcrops\nin the Triassic succession in Rio Grande do Sul State, the\nSchoenstatt outcrop is characterized by a bone accumulation\nof low taxonomic variability with highly disarticulated and\nselective preservation.\n\nThe traditional taphonomic models (e.g., Holz &amp;\nBarberena, 1994) for the Triassic succession do not explain\nthe taphonomic signature of this particular outcrop, thus a\ndetailed taphonomic study was developed based on\npalaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction\n(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002) in order to understand the\nsequence of events that led to this unusual fossil occurrence.\nSmith &amp; Swart (2002) observed this kind of fossil\nconcentration at the Omingonde Formation (Karoo\nSupergroup, Namibia). They recognized three different\ntaphonomic assemblages. Schoenstatt taphocoenosis seems\nto be very similar to the assemblage found in loessic plains,\n\nFigure 1.

Composite stratigraphic profile of the Triassic successionin the study area, showing main environmental facies and thelithostratigraphic units. The studied outcrop represents the passagefrom the Santa Maria to the Caturrita Formation (modified from Holz\n&amp; Scherer, 2000)\n\nin which isolated skulls without lower jaws and isolated\npostcranial bones of different cynodonts taxa were collected.\n\nSEDIMENTOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY\nOF SCHOENSTATT OUTCROP\n\nThe Schoenstatt outcrop is located alongside road RS\n287 near Santa Cruz do Sul city (UTM (22) 359767 E, 6709062\nN), about 150 km from Porto Alegre (capital of Rio Grande do\nSul State, Figure 1). It displays approximately 20 m of mudstone\n(Alemoa Member, Santa Maria Formation, sensu Andreis et\nal., 1980) topped by nearly 15 m of fine to very fine sandstone\n(Caturrita Formation sensu Andreis et al., 1980).\n\nThe mudstone is either massive or has millimetre scale,\nintermittent horizontal lamination. Rhizoliths, some with fibro-\nradial calcite mineralization and calcium carbonate filled\nfractures are common. The uneven distribution of tetrapod\nfossils in this unit is clearly anomalous. The basal 15 m of the\nsection are almost barren of fossils, whereas the upper part\nof the succession (between 15 and 20 m, Figure 3) numerous\nvertebrate fossils and coprolites are found in lateral\nassociation with carbonate nodules. Immediately above the\nbone concentration, a horizon of carbonate nodules occurs\nin association with calcite-filled fractures.\n\nThe sandstone dominated Caturrita Formation (sensu\nAndreis et al., 1980) at the top of the section is apparently\nbarren of fossils. It is composed of four fine-grained\nsandstone bodies structured with horizontal lamination and\ntrough cross-bedding and very fine-grained sandstones\ndisplaying climbing ripple cross-lamination, rhizoliths and\nsmall carbonate nodules (3 cm diameter).\n\nThe Schoenstatt section is interpreted as a facies\nassociation of channel and floodplain deposits. The upper\nsandstone is interpreted as an in-channel deposit of a low\nsinuosity river with flanking semi arid and sparsely vegetated\nfloodplain represented by the mudrock dominated\ninterchannel sequences.\n\nTetrapod paleofauna\nAbdala et al. (2001) were the first to describe the fauna\n\ncollected at the Schoenstatt outcrop, where more than 50\nbone elements of cynodonts were observed, including skulls,\nlower jaws and postcranium elements. They were classified\nas herbivorous Traversodontids and one carnivorous\nChiniquodontid based on features of the postcanines.\n\nAlthough Abdala et al. (2001) found only cynodonts at\nthe Schoenstatt outcrop, Machado &amp; Kischlat (2003)\ncollected from the same locality several disarticulated bones\nof the skull, a partial lower jaw and a few elements from the\nhind limbs of a proterochampsid archosaur (Figure 4).\n\nTAPHONOMIC DATA\n\nThe taphocoenosis occur in the form of loosely packed,\nscattered bone elements forming a 5 m thick level with\napproximately 10 m lateral extension at the outcrop, as\ndepicted by the schematic block diagram in Figure 3.\n\nData on fossil distribution and taphonomic signatures were\nobtained by detailed stratigraphic description of outcrops and\nacquiring taphonomic data such as fossil orientation,\ndisarticulation, preservation and association with fossil remains.\n\nAll collected specimen were identified and registered in\nthe fossil bone data bank of the vertebrate paleontology\nlaboratory of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul\n(data bank UFRGS PV-T). From analysis of these fossils and\nthe field data some observations can be made.\n\nThere is a predominance of skulls and lower jaws and a\ndisparity in the number of preserved pelvic girdles and\nshoulder girdles (Table 1).\n\nCarbonate concretions (Figure 5) are present in several\nstratigraphic levels within the studied profile, but they are more\nconcentrated in association with the bone accumulations and\nmany of the bones are enveloped in a carbonate crust. X-ray\ndiffractometry and Scanning Electron Microscopy of the\nconcretionary material that occurs on the external surface (Figure\n6A) of the bones as well as the internal permineralization shows\nit to consist mainly of calcite, as is usually found in other\ndiagenetically affected bones from the Santa Maria Formation\n(Andreis et al., 1980; Holz &amp; Schultz, 1998). However, the analysis\ndid indicate the presence of silica, especially in the internal pores\nof the bones (Reichel et al., 2005). The association of quartz and\ncalcite suggests that this area has a distinct mode of preservation,\nwhere silica (quartz) filled the internal porous structure and\nVolkmann and Haversian canals of the bones before the bone\nmaterial itself was replaced by calcite (Figures 6B, C).\n\nBertoni.pmd 20/12/2006, 14:19275\n\n\n\nREVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 9(3), 2006276\n\nPR\nOV\n\nAS\n\nCoprolites occur at the same stratigraphic level as the\nbone accumulation. They consist only of external molds\nsecondarily infilled by calcite (Figure 7) and because no\ninternal structures are preserved, they have not yet been\naccurately identified. The faunal composition of the\ntaphocoenosis is clearly biased towards herbivorous\ncynodonts. The taphocoenosis consists of four types of\nherbivorous cynodonts, one carnivorous cynodont and one\nproterochampsid archosaur. Despite the taxonomic variety,\nthe low diversity of bone elements is noticeable, as well as\nthe rare occurrence of articulated skeletal segments.\n\nMany different complete or fragmented lower jaws and\nskulls, teeth (Figure 8), limb bones, vertebrae and other\nindeterminate fragments were identified, but only one\narticulated vertebral section and one pelvic girdle was found.\nTwo of the four preserved femora belong to herbivorous\ncynodonts, which were huge in comparison to the archosaur\nfound in the taphocoenosis (Table 1).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTaphocoenosis of disarticulated and fragmented bones in a\nfloodplain setting can result from selective transportation by\n\nBone Number of Approximate\n\nspecimens s i z e\n\nSkull 11 (1) 5 - 30 cm (10 cm)\n\nLower Jaw 12 (1) 5 - 30 cm (8 cm)\n\nFemur 2 (2) 10 - 20 cm (10 cm)\n\nPelvic girdle 1 10 cm\n\nIschium 1 5 cm\n\nIlium 1 5 cm\n\nTibia 1 10 cm\n\nHumerus 1 (1) 10 cm (5 cm)\n\nScapulacoracoid 1 3 cm\n\nRadio 2 3 cm\n\nUlna 2 2 cm\n\nArticulated vertebrae 5 10 cm\n\nIsolated vertebrae 5 (1) 2 - 3 cm (1 cm)\n\nIndeterminate fragments 8 Very variable\n\nTable 1.

In addition, there is no\npreferential orientation of the bones, indicating that there was\nno competent unidirectional flow involved in the accumulation\nof these bone elements. The fossil-bearing mudstone is relatively\nhomogeneous throughout the studied section, without\ndevelopment of sandstone lenses, indicating slow settling of\nsuspended sediment within a low energy environment at the\nbottom of a standing water body. Thus, there is no evidence for\nrunning water as an agent for the bone concentration, and the\npresence of fossils has to be explained by other factors than\nhydraulic transportation, such as biogenic concentration.\n\nThe presence of a semi-aquatic proterochampsid\narchosaur supports biogenic concentration as the key agent\nof bone accumulation for this fossil assemblage. Bonaparte\n(1971) and more recently Arcucci (1990) and Sill (1995)\nsuggested an aquatic habit for this archosaur group due to\nadaptations such as a long rostrum, flattened skull and the\ntype of tooth insertion in the lower jaw. The protochampsid\nremains in the bone accumulation suggests the proximity of\na relatively permanent body of water. This archosaur is\n\ncomparable to other Neomesozoic crocodilians which actively\npreyed on smaller animals such as the herbivorous cynodonts.\n\nIn addition, isolated teeth were found lying on top of a\ncynodont skull (Figure 9A) and other have a very irregular\nstacking pattern, herein called a chaotic mode of preservation\n(Figure 9B). These characteristics also strengthens the\nhypothesis of biogenic concentration of this assemblage,\nbecause running water could not stack the bones in that\nway, hence, this mode of accumulation is very likely to be the\nresult of biogenic activity.\n\nAnother factor that corroborates the hypothesis of biogenic\nconcentration by predators/scavengers is the presence of\ncoprolites, because these are characteristic of areas with intense\npredatory activity (Behrensmeyer, 1991) and is an indicative of\nanimal-plant or animal-animal interaction (Behrensmeyer &amp;\nHook, 1992). The analyzed material exhibits surface\ncharacteristics caused by extrusion muscles, but do not present\nadherence of organic debris. Souto (2001) found the same\nfeatures in coprolites of other Triassic locations in Rio Grande\ndo Sul State. The fact that these coprolites are fossilized as\nexternal moulds suggests similar conditions to those causing\nthe non-preservation of plant material in that outcrop.\n\nThe calcareous concretions occur isolated and in\nassociation with the fossils, more densely in patches or\nlenses. This pattern of areal distribution of the concretions is\ntypical of marginal pond environments (Hubert, 1978).\n\nThe presence and amount of carbonate nodules varies\nwithin the geological section, indicating vertical oscillation of\nthe groundwater table (phreatic level). At higher positions,\nplant and animal colonization led to the formation of porosity\nof the soil profile. Cementation in the vadose zone is frequently\nassociated with rhyzoliths, which record the orientation and\nposition of former root systems (Beckner &amp; Mosley, 1998).\n\nAt a later stage, this porous zone is filled with carbonate,\nrecording the marginal zone of the ponds formed when the\nphreatic level intersects the floodplain surface (da Rosa et\nal., 2003). At the base of the mudstone succession of the\n\nFigure 4. The presence of a proterochampsidae archosaur is a\n\nkey factor for the interpretation of the fossil assemblage studied in\n\nthis paper, because this archosaur group had an aquatic habit, as\n\nindicated by adaptations such as a long rostrum, flattened skull\n\nand the type of teeth insertion in the lower jaw. This kind of\n\narchosaur was capable of preying on small animals.

In addition, the presence of rhyzolithes indicate\npaleosols (Klappa, 1980), showing that this area was wet\nenough to develop vegetation.\n\nCaliche horizons found within the mudstones and\nsandstones of the fluvial systems are the result of progressive\nsoil calcification which is characteristic of arid or semi-arid\nclimates, such as those prevailing during the Middle Triassic\n(Holz &amp; Scherer, 2000). The presence of caliche concretions\nwithin the floodplain deposits suggests deposition under a hot\nclimate with alternating wet and dry seasons (Pierini et al., 2005)\nforming ephemeral water bodies on the floodplain. During periods\nof restricted rainfall, any standing water body would be quickly\noccupied by the vertebrate groups that lived in the area\n\nOrigin of the taphocoenosis\nThe sedimentological and taphonomic data suggest that\n\nthe Schoenstatt outcrop area was an oasis on a semi-arid\nfloodplain, since vertebrate remains generally are rare in distal\nfloodplain deposits and, when they occur, they are preserved\nas disarticulated or isolated postcranium elements, such as\nvertebrae and ribs (Smith, 1980, 1993).\n\nSince the fossiliferous association in the study area is\ncomposed of 90% herbivorous and carnivorous cynodonts\nand there is no evidence of hydraulic transport, we consider\nthat the composition of this taphocoenosis biased and does\nnot accurately reflect the composition of the fauna that lived\nin the region at that time. The taphonomic pattern displayed\nby the Schoenstatt outcrop leads us to the conclusion that\nthis bias is caused by biogenic concentration.\n\nWood et al. (1988), Dominguez-Rodrigo (1998), Hungerb\u00fchler\n(1998) and recently Sanders et al. (2003) observed floodplain\n\nsediments with fossiliferous concentration strongly biased\ntowards preservation of skulls and lower jaws, besides an uneven\nrelation between the number of preserved scapular and pelvic\ngirdles, and association of bone remains from different Voorhies\ngroups. These studies indicate that this kind of taphocoenosis\nis formed as a result of predator/scavenger action. Skulls and\nlower jaws represent bones with relatively low nutritional value\nand therefore are usually discarded by predators (Behrensmeyer,\n1991), hence they accumulate and concentrate in the floodplain.\nBehrensmeyer &amp; Boaz (1980) state that predation may result in\nconcentration of carcasses in habitats like swamps, ponds and\nwaterholes, where scavengers and predators may have dragged\ndead animals away from the habitats in which they lived. When\nlower jaws are broken posterior to the symphisis, this may indicate\npredator action, because modern hyenas are known to break these\nbones to access the tongue (Behrensmeyer &amp; Boaz, 1980).\n\nIn the case of the Schoenstatt taphocoenosis, carnivorous\ncynodonts and archosaurs were probably responsible for bone\nconcentration, although direct evidence of necrophagy or\npredation (e.g., tooth marks) have not been recorded. Mechanical\nremoval of the caliche crust reveals a highly crazed bone surface,\nhence precluding accurate observation of tiny structures such\nas tooth marks. A similar situation is described by Smith (1980)\nstudying several outcrops from the Beaufort Formation (South\nAfrica), where predation/necrophagy is interpreted to be the\ncause for the observed preservational bias of the taphocoenosis,\nin spite of the lack of direct evidence. Njau &amp; Blumenschine\n(2006) point out that predators, such as the proterochampsid\narchosaur of the Schoenestatt taphocoenosis, lived in aquatic\nsettings. Normally, they do not transport prey over long\ndistances and usually consume prey in the water, a short distance\nfrom the kill site, typically on the shoreline. Njau &amp; Blumenschine\n(2006) suggest that mammalian carnivores gnaw and break bones\nto various degrees in order to access marrow, grease and brain\ntissue. Tooth-marking is inflicted during defleshing, gnawing,\n\nFigure 6. The fossils recovered from the study outcrop show both\n\nexternal and internal concretionary mineralization.

In contrast, crocodilians access these\nnutrients by producing carcass segments, some of which can\nbe swallowed whole. Those parts that cannot be reduced in size\nsufficiently may come to bear tooth marks and other bone\ndamage before being abandoned. The carcass parts that escape\nconsumption are discarded either complete or broken and allowed\nto sink to the bottom of the pond. The discarded fragments are\nreferred to by Davidson &amp; Solomon (1990) as \u201cflown-off\u201d pieces\nand result in scattered and isolated fossil bone accumulations\nwith little or no evidence of gnawing and chewing, a pattern\nvery similar to the fossil record at the Schoenstatt outcrop.\n\nRogers &amp; Broughton (2001) define three hypothetical agents\nof biogenic selection of the bone remains, based on the difficulty\nof disarticulation and transport of the selected part (i) unselective:\nthe hunter usually transports the entire preyed animal; (ii) more\nselective: the hunter usually discards parts of low use before\ntransporting the carcass; (iii) most selective: the hunter usually\ntransports parts of highest use only. Based on this classification,\nwe suggest that the Schoenstatt taphocoenosis was caused by\nmost selective action, because skulls, lower jaws, tooth and\nvertebral elements were preferentially preserved and all\nconsidered elements with low nutritional value.\n\nTaphonomic model\nDuring deposition of the Schoenstatt strata a sequence of\n\nbiogenic, sedimentary and climatic events occurred leading to\nthe preservation of a biogenically concentrated taphocoenosis\n\nFigure 8. The fossil.bearing strata contains bones of very different\n\nsizes and shapes, hence precluding selective transportation.

Features of the fossils found at the outcrop: A, teeth preserved at the roof top of the skull; B, anterior fragment of a skull in dorsal\n\nview, with a right forelimb composed by a humerus, ulna and a radius attached. This kind of preservational features precludes hydraulic\n\nsorting and strengthens the hypothesis of biogenic concentration of this assemblage.

In this situation,\nthe ephemeral lake margin developed vegetation and attracted\nherbivorous therapsids and, in their consequent carnivorous\npredator and scavenger species, an ecologic situation which\nresulted in a biased record, favoring the preservation and\naccumulation of the least nutritious bone elements.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThanks are due to R.

Terrestrial\n\nbones that were in the vadose zone, forming the external and\ninternal concretions observed in the collected specimen.\n\nDuring a subsequent drought period, the carbonate encrusted\nbones were subjected to incipient silicification, marking the early\ndiagenetic phase of the diagenetic process. This silica probably\nprecipitated in the carbonate encrusted bones because of the\ngeochemically active halo surrounding the bones, since calcium\ncarbonate creates an extremely alkaline microenvironment.\n\nThe absence of fossil bones and the small quantities of\ncarbonate nodules and rhyzoliths in the lower portion of the\nmudstone section suggests a prolongated period of low phreatic\nlevel, representing a period of drought situation that resulted in\nformation of very low biomass during that period, hence the\nabsence of fossils in that part of the stratigraphic section.\n\nFinally, using an analogy with recent ecosystems, the\nlocus represented by the Schoenstatt outcrop suggests an\noasis, with availability of water and vegetation, occurring in\nthe middle of a relatively extensive dry floodplain.\n\nThe Schoenstatt palaeoenvironment may be compared\nwith Etosha pan in Namibia, an extensive topographic\ndepression seasonally flooded, holding water for a short time\nduring the rainy season. During the dry season the landscape\nchanges. Large shallow lakes evaporate quickly and take the\nform of salt-crusted, desiccated mud. Because of these\ndramatic seasonal changes, species that reside here must be\nable to adapt or migrate to other areas (Hipondoka, 2005).\nThe Etosha pan supports a great number of animals, such as\nwhite rhinos, elephants, hunting dogs, lions, leopards, and\nantelopes during the wet season (Mwalyosi, 1977). So, this\narea seems to have the function of a wetland in the semi-arid\nclimate of Namibia, creating an oasis within the arid corridor\nwhich stretches from the northeast of the African continent\nto the coast of Namibia in the south-west (Bobe, 2006).\n\n The Schoenstatt outcrop is interpreted as the geological record\nof a seasonally flooded pond, with huge concentration of calcium\ncarbonate, located at a great semi-arid floodplain, similar in many\nways to the present day environment of Ethosa pan in Namibia.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe taphonomic analysis presented here integrates\nsedimentological and paleontological data to explain the formation\nand preservation of a new type of taphocoenosis in South-Brazilian\nTriassic rocks. Based on this data set, can be concluded that the\ntaphocoenosis had little or no direct influence of hydraulic transport,\nas indicated (i) by the enclosing rock types (finely laminated and\nmassive mudstone of a distal floodplain setting) indicating slow\nsettling of suspended sediment, incapable to transport bones, (ii)\nby the lack of orientation of the fossil bones and (iii) by the\nnoticeable mixture of bones with very different sizes and densities.\n\nThe taphocoenosis contains mainly bones of herbivorous\nand carnivorous cynodonts (90%) and hydraulic\ntransportation appears to have played no role in its formation.\nThus the faunal composition is taken to reflect the original\nbiocoenosis, with a predominance of herbivores over\ncarnivorous individuals.
