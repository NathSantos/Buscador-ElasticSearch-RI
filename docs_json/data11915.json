There is not enough space here to list all of them and \n\nthe ways they have helped me. From the administrative personnel at the various institutions I \n\nvisited (most notably, Christina Book, at NCAR in Boulder [U.S.A.], a friend for life!), to the \n\ngraduate and undergraduate students I met at some of those research centers, not forgetting the \n\nroommates and landladies I had during my stays abroad (especially, 91 years young Louise \n\nAdams, a dear friend!), or even the, always amicable, NCAR shuttle drivers, I truly believe that \n\nevery single person I met during this, not always easy, journey deserves my profound \n\nappreciation. \n\nTo Professor Pedro Miranda, from the University of Lisbon (UL), I am indebted for the \n\ncontinued support and guidance (muito obrigado Professor!). Doctor Jo\u00e3o Teixeira, the \n\ncoordinator of the GPCI project, has been crucial in helping to define the context for my \n\ndoctoral work. I here acknowledge all the support and research opportunities he offered me \n\n(muito obrigado Jo\u00e3o!). Doctor Pedro Soares from the Center of Geophysics of the University \n\nof Lisbon has always been available, and provided significant guidance at important stages of \n\nmy work. Doctor Pedro Viterbo, from then Portuguese Meteorological Institute, offered helpful \n\ncomments on work developed during the first doctoral year. It was with great pleasure that I \n\nworked under the supervision of both Doctor Phil Rasch, and Doctor Andrew Gettelman, while \n\nat NCAR. Their friendly and informal ways gave me with much needed confidence in my \n\nresearch work. I additionally thank Professor Jos\u00e9 Teixeira da Silva (UL), and Professor \n\nFernando Santos (UL), for providing me with letters of recommendation. \n\nMany thanks go to all the GPCI collaborators, whose model simulations and observational data \n\nare the raw material for my doctoral investigation. I am especially appreciative of the \n\ninteraction with Doctors Cecile Hannay and Jennifer Kay, from NCAR, Doctor Roel Neggers \n\nfrom the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), Doctor Johannes Karlsson from \n\nthe Department of Meteorology of the Stockholm University (MISU), and Doctor Yuying \n\nZhang from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL, U.S.A.). \n\nA few unstructured one-on-one meetings were very insightful and provided me with interesting \n\nideas and suggestions, namely, the meetings in Boulder with Doctor George Kiladis, at the \n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (U.S.A.), and with Doctor Gunilla \n\nSvensson (MISU), at NCAR; the meetings in Pasadena, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \n\n|  ii  | \n\n\n\n \n\n(U.S.A.), with Doctors Edward Olsen, Eric Fetzer, and Brian Kahn; and a more recent meeting \n\nat NCAR with Doctor Peter Caldwell (LLNL / Program For Climate Model Diagnosis and \n\nIntercomparison [PCMDI], U.S.A.). \n\nFinally, to my parents and sister, an infinite thank you for all the support and love, and, last but \n\nnot least, to Doctor Sylvain Dupont: thank you for always being there (merci Vain!). \n\n|  iii  | \n\n\n\n \n\nAbstract \n \n\nThe GPCI (GCSS / working group on numerical experimentation Pacific Cross-section \n\nIntercomparison) project offers a new approach for the intercomparison of models, by focusing \n\nthe analysis on a single cross section in the NE Pacific ocean. It is targeted at the \n\nstratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep convection regimes, as well as the respective \n\ntransitions. Three-hourly satellite observations and model simulations were prepared for GPCI \n\nfor the JJA season. The seasonal mean results for variables such as total cloud cover, liquid \n\nwater path, and outgoing longwave radiation show high scatter among models. Mean vertical \n\nvelocity, and relative humidity, suggest good, overall, representation of the Hadley circulation. \n\nStill, differences exist between models (e.g., in the intensity of the deep convection, or \n\nhumidity content in the boundary layer). The main cloud types are represented differently (e.g., \n\ntoo low stratocumulus clouds). The transitions between stratocumulus and shallow cumulus \n\nshow two distinct behaviours (smooth versus abrupt with bimodal nature) reflecting distinct \n\ncloud parameterization approaches. None of them reproduces well the observations. Following \n\nGEPAT (Grade-based Empirical Pattern Analysis Technique), different cloud patterns were \n\nanalyzed in terms of the means of associated parameters. Model relative humidity has negative \n\nbiases in the boundary layer and subtropical mid troposphere. sBLT (sequential Boundary-\n\nLayer-Top determination scheme) offered a more thorough characterization of the boundary \n\nlayer (top). Mean BLT height and strength show big spread among models. Models disagree in \n\nthe time of the diurnal maxima of relative humidity, cloud fraction, and liquid water content. \n\nPrecipitation lacks in diurnal amplitude in the deep convection area. The \u201cScinertia\u201d concept \n\nwas introduced, based on the analysis of diurnal cycle results for cloud cover and low \n\ntropospheric stability. GPCI proved useful for the work presented below, both in the \n\ncharacterization of model shortcomings, and in helping envision avenues for future \n\ninvestigation using models and observations. \n\nKeywords: GPCI, cloud regimes, GEPAT, boundary layer, sBLT, humidity structure, Scinertia \n\n|  iv  | \n\n\n\n \n\nResumo \n \n\nApesar dos consider\u00e1veis avan\u00e7os dos \u00faltimos 20 anos ao n\u00edvel da parametriza\u00e7\u00e3o de nuvens, a \n\nrepresenta\u00e7\u00e3o de nuvens ainda \u00e9 um desfio para as comunidades de modela\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo e do \n\nclima. A urg\u00eancia do desenvolvimento de parametriza\u00e7\u00f5es de nuvens para modelos de \n\ncircula\u00e7\u00e3o geral (GCM) \u00e9 refor\u00e7ada pelo facto de a quantidade de nuvens gerada pelos modelos \n\nter um impacto significativo no comportamento do sistema clim\u00e1tico previsto pelos modelos. \n\nEm particular, os atuais modelos de clima tendem a responder de forma diferente em \n\nexperi\u00eancias de sensibilidade das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas. Defici\u00eancias nas parametriza\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nresultam igualmente numa representa\u00e7\u00e3o inconsistente do ciclo hidrol\u00f3gico ao n\u00edvel \n\ntermodin\u00e2mico, o que acarreta importantes consequ\u00eancias para a simula\u00e7\u00e3o da circula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\natmosf\u00e9rica tropical e subtropical. Estes t\u00f3picos s\u00e3o investigados por diferentes grupos do \n\nGCSS (Global energy and water cycle experiment Cloud System Study), cuja estrat\u00e9gia tem \n\nsido bem sucedida na defini\u00e7\u00e3o e compreens\u00e3o de regimes de nuvens fundamentais, e no \n\ndesenvolvimento e melhoramento de parametriza\u00e7\u00f5es de nuvens. No entanto, o uso exclusivo \n\nde vers\u00f5es unidimensionais dos modelos atmosf\u00e9ricos, tradicionalmente feito no GCSS, n\u00e3o \n\npermite uma compreens\u00e3o profunda do papel fundamental das nuvens no clima, o que implica \n\nque as parametriza\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00eam de ser testadas nas vers\u00f5es completas (tridimensionais) dos GCMs. \n\nEssa \u00e9 uma tarefa que pode ter que envolver a an\u00e1lise de enormes quantidades de dados de \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas. \n\nNeste contexto, o projeto GPCI (GCSS / working group on numerical experimentation Pacific \n\nCross-section Intercomparison) oferece uma nova (e menos pesada) abordagem para a \n\nintercompara\u00e7\u00e3o de GCMs, focando a an\u00e1lise num n\u00famero reduzido de localiza\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo \n\nde uma sec\u00e7\u00e3o, e permitindo uma integra\u00e7\u00e3o de dados de modelos e de observa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nrelativamente simples. GPCI tem estado centrado nos (sub)tr\u00f3picos do sector NE do oceano \n\nPac\u00edfico, e desenvolveu um programa especificamente dedicado \u00e0 investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de regimes de \n\nnuvens fundamentais que tipicamente ocorrem nas fronteiras orientais dos oceanos \n\n(sub)tropicais, nomeadamente, estratoc\u00famulos, c\u00famulos pouco profundos, torres de convec\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nprofunda, e as transi\u00e7\u00f5es entre eles. O conhecimento ganho a partir de uma an\u00e1lise detalhada \n\ndo comportamento destes sistemas de nuvens e dos ambientes din\u00e2micos e termodin\u00e2micos a \n\neles associados, recorrendo a dados de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal obtidos de observa\u00e7\u00f5es e de \n\nmodelos de previs\u00e3o do tempo e do clima, dever\u00e1 oferecer pistas para o desenvolvimento e \n\nmelhoramento de novas parametriza\u00e7\u00f5es de nuvens, camada limite e convec\u00e7\u00e3o. Tendo sido \n\n|  v  | \n\n\n\n \n\ndesenvolvida em estreita liga\u00e7\u00e3o com o projeto GPCI, a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o apresentada nesta tese foi \n\norientada segundo as linhas dos principais objetivos e quest\u00f5es cient\u00edficas do projeto. \n\nGPCI pode ser visto como um projeto de intercompara\u00e7\u00e3o de n\u00edvel 2, em que todos os modelos \n\nparticipantes t\u00eam de seguir um conjunto comum de especifica\u00e7\u00f5es e protocolos predefinidos. A \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00e3o b\u00e1sica imposta foi a de que os modelos deveriam correr em modo de clima, usando \n\ntemperatura da superf\u00edcie do mar (SST) prescrita como condi\u00e7\u00e3o fronteira. O per\u00edodo de \n\ninteresse corresponde a junho-julho-agosto (JJA). A regi\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica a estudar esta \n\ncompreendida entre -5\u00baN a 45\u00baN e 160\u00baE a 240\u00baE, e inclui 13 localiza\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo de uma \n\nsec\u00e7\u00e3o. Os resultados das simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas foram pedidos numa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal de 3 \n\nhoras para vari\u00e1veis na forma de perfis verticais e para vari\u00e1veis a um n\u00edvel fixo. Mais de vinte \n\ninstitui\u00e7\u00f5es de previs\u00e3o do tempo e do clima aderiram ao projeto e extensas quantidades de \n\ndados de sat\u00e9lite foram preparados para uso no GPCI. A an\u00e1lise de dados de modelos e de \n\nrean\u00e1lises sugere que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel estudar os principais aspetos da fenomenologia das nuvens, \n\nrecorrendo apenas a uma sec\u00e7\u00e3o individual alinhada com a circula\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica associada \u00e0 \n\ncircula\u00e7\u00e3o da c\u00e9lula de Hadley na regi\u00e3o em causa. \n\nUma an\u00e1lise preliminar de dados de modelos e de observa\u00e7\u00f5es, com o objetivo de se obter uma \n\nvis\u00e3o geral das carater\u00edsticas m\u00e9dias do ciclo hidrol\u00f3gico durante o ver\u00e3o na regi\u00e3o GPCI, foi \n\nfeita com particular enfase na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o vertical das nuvens, e nos processos que envolvem \n\nfatores din\u00e2micos e ambientais que t\u00eam um papel na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o dos campos de nuvens. As \n\nm\u00e9dias sazonais da maior parte das vari\u00e1veis (e.g., cobertura nebulosa total [TCC], conte\u00fado \n\nde \u00e1gua l\u00edquida integrado na vertical [LWP], e radia\u00e7\u00e3o emergente de longo comprimento de \n\nonda [OLR]) s\u00e3o caracterizadas por um elevado grau de dispers\u00e3o entre os v\u00e1rios modelos, que \n\nraramente mostram uma boa concord\u00e2ncia com as observa\u00e7\u00f5es em todos os pontos da sec\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nPerfis m\u00e9dios de velocidade vertical (w) e de humidade relativa (RH), sugerem que as \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas b\u00e1sicas da circula\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica regional imposta pela c\u00e9lula de Hadley s\u00e3o, de \n\num modo geral, bem representadas, apesar de, em detalhe, existirem diferen\u00e7as substanciais \n\nentre os v\u00e1rios modelos (e.g., na intensidade da convec\u00e7\u00e3o profunda, ou no conte\u00fado em \n\nhumidade na camada limite). Uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o vertical de cobertura nebulosa \n\n(CF) nos v\u00e1rios modelos, mostrou bem os desafios da parametriza\u00e7\u00e3o e simula\u00e7\u00e3o de nuvens \n\nem GCMs, com as simula\u00e7\u00f5es a mostrarem uma variedade de comportamentos ao n\u00edvel da \n\nrepresenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos diferentes tipos de nuvens (e.g., estratoc\u00famulos demasiado baixos) e das \n\ntransi\u00e7\u00f5es entre eles (e.g., presen\u00e7a de mais do que uma camada de nuvens nas \u00e1reas de \n\ntransi\u00e7\u00e3o). Estes resultados foram validados com observa\u00e7\u00f5es da ocorr\u00eancia de nuvens obtidas \n\n|  vi  | \n\n\n\n \n\ncom os sat\u00e9lites CloudSat e CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite \n\nObservations). Um estudo ao n\u00edvel dos processos f\u00edsicos relevantes para as nuvens, revelou \n\nque, de um modo geral, existe uma resposta not\u00f3ria da circula\u00e7\u00e3o de larga escala a mudan\u00e7as \n\nna SST prescrita nos modelos. As respostas de outras vari\u00e1veis, tais como, balan\u00e7o da radia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde pequeno comprimento de onda no topo da atmosfera (NSRTOA) e TCC, s\u00e3o ainda mais \n\npronunciadas e variam de modelo para modelo. O facto de, na maior parte dos modelos, a \n\nresposta ao aumento da SST nem sempre ser coerente entre as diferentes vari\u00e1veis, aponta para \n\na necessidade de um melhor controlo do comportamento da simula\u00e7\u00e3o de importantes \n\npar\u00e2metros relacionados com as nuvens, incluindo aqueles cruciais para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nfor\u00e7amento radiativo das nuvens. N\u00e3o foi encontrada (nos dados de 3-em-3 horas das \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00f5es para JJA 1998) nenhuma rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3bvia entre as nuvens baixas (dos regimes de \n\nc\u00famulos pouco profundos e de estratoc\u00famulos) a subsid\u00eancia e a SST (ou mesmo a \n\nestabilidade est\u00e1tica da baixa troposfera [LTS]). \n\nFoi feita uma an\u00e1lise de fundo da transi\u00e7\u00e3o entre regimes convectivos, baseada no \n\ncomportamento espaciotemporal das nuvens em simula\u00e7\u00f5es dos modelos, em rean\u00e1lises e em \n\nobserva\u00e7\u00f5es de sat\u00e9lite. Com esse objetivo em mente, foram desenvolvidas v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas para \n\ndetetar transi\u00e7\u00f5es de regime de nuvens, e ou, caracterizar a sua estrutura sazonal. Fun\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de probabilidade, obtidas para TCC nas v\u00e1rias posi\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo da sec\u00e7\u00e3o GPCI, \n\na partir de dados de 3-em-3 horas para a esta\u00e7\u00e3o JJA 1998, mostram diferen\u00e7as de modelo para \n\nmodelo e apresentam importantes disparidades mesmo em posi\u00e7\u00f5es onde os modelos mostram \n\npraticamente o mesmo valor na TCC m\u00e9dia. Dois comportamentos distintos foram \n\nidentificados ao n\u00edvel da transi\u00e7\u00e3o entre os estratoc\u00famulos e os c\u00famulos dos ventos al\u00edsios: \n\numa transi\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente gradual da TCC; e uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o mais abrupta, com car\u00e1cter \n\nbimodal. Estes dois tipos de comportamentos s\u00e3o, provavelmente, um resultado da maneira \n\ncomo as nuvens s\u00e3o parametrizadas nos respetivos modelos. De qualquer maneira, nenhum \n\ndestes comportamentos coincide com a forma como as transi\u00e7\u00f5es se d\u00e3o em dados \n\ncorrespondentes a observa\u00e7\u00f5es da TCC do ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology \n\nProject). Estat\u00edsticas da cobertura nebulosa obtidas segundo uma metodologia desenvolvida \n\npara a dete\u00e7\u00e3o de fortes gradientes de TCC ao longo da sec\u00e7\u00e3o, mostram uma diversidade de \n\ncomportamentos entre os modelos, por exemplo, no valor m\u00e9dio do decr\u00e9scimo de TCC, na \n\nsua frequ\u00eancia de ocorr\u00eancia, ou nos histogramas da localiza\u00e7\u00e3o dessas transi\u00e7\u00f5es em TCC (as \n\nrean\u00e1lises tamb\u00e9m diferem do ISCCP). Adicionalmente, foi tamb\u00e9m efetuada uma an\u00e1lise \n\nespectral preliminar da s\u00e9rie temporal correspondente a varia\u00e7\u00f5es da localiza\u00e7\u00e3o das transi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\n|  vii  | \n\n\n\n \n\nabruptas em TCC ao longo da sec\u00e7\u00e3o. N\u00e3o tendo sido detetados picos importantes nos \n\nrespetivos espectros, foi na forma da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal nas correspondentes s\u00e9ries, que os \n\nmodelos mais se distinguiram (e.g., uma tend\u00eancia, num dos modelos, para as transi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nocorrerem mais para norte na sec\u00e7\u00e3o no per\u00edodo final da esta\u00e7\u00e3o JJA; ou a relativamente \n\npequena amplitude das oscila\u00e7\u00f5es de localiza\u00e7\u00e3o encontradas num outro modelo). Em termos \n\nda evolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial da altura do topo das nuvens vista ao longo da sec\u00e7\u00e3o, a m\u00e9dia dos \n\nmodelos est\u00e1 pr\u00f3xima dos dados de an\u00e1lise, apesar de, especialmente a sul das \u00e1reas de \n\nestratoc\u00famulos, todos os resultados diferirem de observa\u00e7\u00f5es MISR (Multiangle Imaging \n\nSpectroradiometer). Ainda no contexto da transi\u00e7\u00e3o de regime de nuvens, foi desenvolvida \n\numa nova abordagem de an\u00e1lise de padr\u00f5es espaciais (GEPAT [Grade-based Empirical Pattern \n\nAnalysis Technique]) com objetivo de se analisarem as condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais associadas a \n\ndiferentes estruturas espaciais da TCC identificadas pela nova t\u00e9cnica durante a esta\u00e7\u00e3o JJA \n\n1998. Foram assim encontrados seis diferentes padr\u00f5es espaciais de cobertura nebulosa t\u00edpicos \n\nda esta\u00e7\u00e3o (cada um com diferente representatividade de ocorr\u00eancia temporal). As \n\ncorrespondentes m\u00e9dias em termos de outras vari\u00e1veis, tais como w aos 700 hPa, LWP, SST, \n\nLTS, e dire\u00e7\u00e3o e intensidade do vento, foram analisadas, tendo sido encontradas diferen\u00e7as, \n\nespecialmente ao n\u00edvel dos campos de w aos 700 hPa e LWP. Algumas ideias da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfutura da t\u00e9cnica incluem: a an\u00e1lise de outras esta\u00e7\u00f5es e anos (separada ou conjuntamente); \n\numa compara\u00e7\u00e3o de resultados para diferentes regi\u00f5es; e o uso de dados puramente \n\nobservacionais. \n\nFoi dada especial aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 estrutura da humidade na regi\u00e3o GPCI, com o objetivo de uma \n\nmaior compreens\u00e3o do seu papel como um dos principais par\u00e2metros no contexto do ciclo \n\nhidrol\u00f3gico, particularmente atrav\u00e9s da sua influ\u00eancia na forma\u00e7\u00e3o e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das nuvens. Para \n\nesse fim, foram analisadas ao longo da sec\u00e7\u00e3o, observa\u00e7\u00f5es de sat\u00e9lite (AIRS [Atmospheric \n\nInfraRed Sounder]), simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas e an\u00e1lises da atmosfera, referentes a perfis de RH, \n\nobtidos para JJA (2003) na forma de m\u00e9dias sazonais, vari\u00e2ncia e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal. A \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o dos modelos com os dados AIRS mostrou diferen\u00e7as significativas (e.g., valores \n\nbastante inferiores de RH nos n\u00edveis mais baixos da camada limite nas simula\u00e7\u00f5es, valores \n\nmais elevados do que as observa\u00e7\u00f5es na tropopausa, e maior secura aos n\u00edveis m\u00e9dios da \n\natmosfera nas regi\u00f5es subtropicais nos modelos). No que diz respeito ao desvio padr\u00e3o, ainda \n\nque, de um modo geral, os modelos apresentem maior variabilidade de RH, existem nas \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00f5es, valores mais baixos na camada limite ao longo de toda a sec\u00e7\u00e3o. Pensa-se que os \n\nvalores mais elevados de desvio padr\u00e3o apresentados pelos modelos imediatamente acima da \n\n|  viii  | \n\n\n\n \n\ncamada limite a norte da regi\u00e3o dos c\u00famulos pouco profundos devam estar associados \n\nprimariamente \u00e0 relativamente fraca resolu\u00e7\u00e3o vertical dos dados AIRS usados (mais do que \n\nserem uma consequ\u00eancia de defici\u00eancias nos modelos). A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nvertical de RH parece apontar para a necessidade de se incluir na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o das transi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nentre os estratoc\u00famulos e os c\u00famulos dos ventos al\u00edsios, a influ\u00eancia, n\u00e3o apenas da estrutura \n\nda humidade nas camadas da troposfera logo acima da camada limite, mas tamb\u00e9m do perfil de \n\nhumidade at\u00e9 \u00e0s camadas superiores da troposfera. Mais especificamente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 \n\nestrutura da humidade na baixa troposfera, foi apresentada uma nova metodologia para a \n\ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o do topo da camada limite sobre o oceano (sBLT [sequential Boundary-Layer-\n\nTop determination scheme]). Os resultados preliminares parecem promissores, especialmente \n\npela sua abrangente aplicabilidade, e dado que a t\u00e9cnica permite uma maior caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ncamada limite (e do seu topo) que outros m\u00e9todos relacionados. M\u00e9dias sazonais para a altura e \n\na intensidade do topo da camada limite foram analisadas para modelos e an\u00e1lises ao longo da \n\nsec\u00e7\u00e3o GPCI, e mostram dispers\u00e3o consider\u00e1vel, exceto em termos da (praticamente comum) \n\ntaxa de subida do topo da camada limite de norte para sul entre a \u00e1rea dos estratoc\u00famulos e a \n\ndos c\u00famulos pouco profundos. As \u00e1reas de convec\u00e7\u00e3o profunda e dos estratoc\u00famulos \n\napresentam, respetivamente, o maior e o menor grau de defini\u00e7\u00e3o (intensidade) do topo da \n\ncamada limite. Segundo a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o sBLT, foram encontradas nos modelos, e para as v\u00e1rias \n\nlocaliza\u00e7\u00f5es na sec\u00e7\u00e3o, diferen\u00e7as na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal da representatividade dos v\u00e1rios \n\ntipos de camada limite. A esse respeito, apenas dois dos modelos se assemelham \u00e0s \n\nobserva\u00e7\u00f5es AIRS. Foi ainda desenvolvida uma vers\u00e3o atualizada da t\u00e9cnica para dete\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmudan\u00e7as abruptas na cobertura nebulosa ao longo da sec\u00e7\u00e3o. A nova metodologia pareceu \n\napresentar maior robustez no constrangimento dos resultados dos modelos para aquelas \n\nsitua\u00e7\u00f5es que efetivamente correspondem a transi\u00e7\u00f5es espacialmente consistentes com a \n\ndefini\u00e7\u00e3o dos regimes de nuvens caracter\u00edsticos dos estratoc\u00famulos e dos c\u00famulos dos ventos \n\nal\u00edsios. Os valores da ocorr\u00eancia das transi\u00e7\u00f5es baixou drasticamente na maior parte dos \n\nmodelos, e permitiu, uma melhor identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos impactos que diferentes filosofias de \n\nparametriza\u00e7\u00e3o de nuvens t\u00eam no comportamento dos modelos a este n\u00edvel. Por \u00faltimo, foram \n\nobtidos os perfis m\u00e9dios de RH correspondentes a cada um dos dois regimes de nuvens \n\nidentificados, tendo sido verificadas importantes diferen\u00e7as entre os dois regimes, para um \n\ndeterminado modelo, mas tamb\u00e9m entre os modelos, principalmente na forma como diferem os \n\nseus perfis de estratoc\u00famulos e de c\u00famulos pouco profundos na m\u00e9dia e alta troposfera. Foram \n\npropostas formas concretas de se estender a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o dos potenciais impactos da estrutura \n\nda humidade da troposfera na transi\u00e7\u00e3o entre os regimes de nuvens. \n\n|  ix  | \n\n\n\n \n\nUm dos principais t\u00f3picos para o projeto GPCI \u00e9 a representa\u00e7\u00e3o, em modelos de previs\u00e3o do \n\ntempo e do clima, de varia\u00e7\u00f5es diurnas das nuvens e de par\u00e2metros relacionados. Essas \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es foram analisadas com base em dados de 3-em-3 horas obtidos dos modelos e de \n\nobserva\u00e7\u00f5es. O ciclo diurno m\u00e9dio na esta\u00e7\u00e3o JJA foi descrito para diferentes localiza\u00e7\u00f5es na \n\nsec\u00e7\u00e3o GPCI. Foram apresentados resultados para: circula\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica associada com a \n\ndin\u00e2mica de larga escala na regi\u00e3o do Pac\u00edfico NE dominada pela c\u00e9lula de Hadley; perfis \n\nverticais de v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros de interesse para as nuvens; e anomalias m\u00e9dias do ciclo diurno \n\nem tr\u00eas posi\u00e7\u00f5es da sec\u00e7\u00e3o, representativas dos principais regimes de nuvens/convec\u00e7\u00e3o que \n\ncaracterizam a regi\u00e3o. A velocidade vertical aos 700 hPa apresenta, em geral, nos modelos e \n\nan\u00e1lises, um ciclo diurno marcado na zona de converg\u00eancia inter-tropical (ITCZ). Nalguns \n\nmodelos varia\u00e7\u00f5es diurnas mais fracas foram tamb\u00e9m encontradas na regi\u00e3o dos ventos al\u00edsios \n\ne nas regi\u00f5es subtropicais. Num dos modelos o ciclo diurno de w aos 700 hPa \u00e9 praticamente \n\ninexistente em qualquer das posi\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo da sec\u00e7\u00e3o. A intensidade e dire\u00e7\u00e3o do vento na \n\nbaixa troposfera mostrou varia\u00e7\u00f5es diurnas caracter\u00edsticas. A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o vertical de RH, CF, e \n\nconte\u00fado em \u00e1gua l\u00edquida das nuvens (CLW), mostrou alguma variabilidade diurna em todos \n\nos modelos analisados, especialmente abaixo dos 600 hPa na \u00e1rea de convec\u00e7\u00e3o profunda. Os \n\nmodelos n\u00e3o concordam na altura do ciclo diurno em que simulam os valores m\u00e1ximos destas \n\nvari\u00e1veis. Verificou-se, em geral, uma melhor concord\u00e2ncia entre a varia\u00e7\u00e3o diurna de CF e \n\nCLW nos estratoc\u00famulos e nos c\u00famulos pouco profundos do que na ITCZ. H\u00e1, na regi\u00e3o \n\nsubtropical num dos modelos, CF simulada sem CLW associada. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s anomalias \n\nm\u00e9dias diurnas de LTS, TCC, e precipita\u00e7\u00e3o (observa\u00e7\u00f5es deste par\u00e2metro foram obtidas de \n\ndados TRMM [Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]), os modelos tendem a concordar no \n\nprimeiro par\u00e2metro, mas diferem uns dos outros, e em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s observa\u00e7\u00f5es, nos outros \n\ndois.(e.g., na ITCZ, a TCC do ISCCP apresenta dois m\u00e1ximos relativos, sendo o mais \n\npronunciado o que ocorre cerca das 16:00h locais, enquanto que nos modelos e an\u00e1lises, o pico \n\nde TCC mais importante d\u00e1-se tipicamente de madrugada). Nos estratoc\u00famulos o ISCCP \n\n(TCC) tem a menor varia\u00e7\u00e3o diurna, sendo a esse respeito, ultrapassado pelos modelos. De \n\nqualquer maneira, \u00e9 nessa regi\u00e3o que se verifica uma maior concord\u00e2ncia entre modelos, \n\nan\u00e1lises e observa\u00e7\u00f5es na altura do ciclo diurno em que se d\u00e1 o m\u00e1ximo de TCC. No que diz \n\nrespeito \u00e0 taxa de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, a maior parte dos resultados mostra um pico relativamente bem \n\ndefinido em todas as localiza\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo da sec\u00e7\u00e3o, mas apresentam, para os modelos, uma \n\nfraca amplitude diurna na ITCZ comparativamente aos dados TRMM. Finalmente, foi \n\ninvestigada a liga\u00e7\u00e3o, durante o ciclo diurno, entre a LTS e a cobertura nebulosa nos \n\nestratoc\u00famulos para o caso particular de um modelo com um esquema de parametriza\u00e7\u00e3o que \n\n|  x  | \n\n\n\n \n\nassocia os dois, tendo-se argumentado sobre a exist\u00eancia de um certo grau de \u201cin\u00e9rcia\u201d na \n\nresposta da cobertura nebulosa subtropical em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s varia\u00e7\u00f5es diurnas de LTS. Do mesmo \n\nmodo, e uma vez que a resposta (positiva) das nuvens \u00e0 estabilidade est\u00e1tica do ambiente \n\npareceu ser mais eficaz para a altura do ciclo diurno em que o valor de TCC era o mais baixo, \n\ninferiu-se qualitativamente sobre uma poss\u00edvel depend\u00eancia dessa resposta no valor \n\napresentado pela cobertura nebulosa. At\u00e9 que ponto estar\u00e1 a \u201cScin\u00e9rcia\u201d (ou \u201cin\u00e9rcia dos \n\nestratoc\u00famulos [Sc]\u201d em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 LTS) relacionada com a estrutura da humidade da (m\u00e9dia) \n\ntroposfera, foi uma quest\u00e3o deixada para investiga\u00e7\u00e3o futura. \n\nDois pontos, para concluir. Primeiro, este trabalho mostra bem como os atuais modelos de \n\nprevis\u00e3o num\u00e9rica do tempo e do clima ainda apresentam uma deficiente representa\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nnuvens e de processos relacionados. Segundo, a abordagem proposta pelo projeto GPCI provou \n\nser \u00fatil na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos principais problemas dos modelos, e na defini\u00e7\u00e3o de poss\u00edveis \n\nlinhas de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o futura, quer ao n\u00edvel da modela\u00e7\u00e3o, quer na frente observacional. \n\n|  xi  | \n\n\n\n \n\nList of Figures \n \nFigure 2.1 - Annual mean global distribution of low stratiform clouds (stratus, stratocumulus, and fog) obtained \n\nfrom surface observations (from Klein and Hartmann 1993). .................................................................- 8 - \nFigure 2.2 - Illustration of the main cloud regimes associated with thermally direct circulations between the \n\ntropics, and the subtropics of the eastern boundaries of the main oceanic basins (EQ for equator) (from Stevens \n2005). .......................................................................................................................................................- 9 - \n\nFigure 2.3 - Schematic representation of the physical and dynamical processes that affect the cloud-topped \nmaritime boundary layer (adapted from Garratt 1992). .........................................................................- 13 - \n\nFigure 3.1 - Representation of the GCSS/WGNE Pacific cross section (black diagonal line), and ISCCP low cloud \ncover (%) climatology for the June-July-August season (courtesy Dr. Cecile Hannay)........................- 21 - \n\nFigure 3.2 - Histograms of wind direction at 1000 hPa for six points along the GPCI transect from ERA-40 for \nJune-July-August (JJA) 1998.................................................................................................................- 26 - \n\nFigure 3.3 - Histograms of precipitation from the NCAR and GFDL models for one GPCI point (5\u00b0N, 195\u00b0E) and \ntwo adjacent (5\u00b0 to the east and west along the same latitude) points for June-July-August 1998. .......- 27 - \n\nFigure 3.4 - Histograms of total cloud cover from the NCAR and GFDL models for one GPCI point (20\u00b0N, \n215\u00b0E) and two adjacent (5\u00b0 to the east and west along the same latitude) points for June-July-August 1998.\n...............................................................................................................................................................- 28 - \n\nFigure 4.1 - Mean sea surface temperature (SST) along the GPCI transect for June-July-August (JJA) 1998 (left) \nand 2003 (right) from the participating models and ECMWF analysis. ................................................- 29 - \n\nFigure 4.2 - (a) Total column water vapor from the models along GPCI for June-July-August 1998 together with \nERA-40 and SSM/I, (b) as in (a) but for total cloud cover and ISCCP observations, (c) as in (a) but for liquid \nwater path, (d) as in (a) but for precipitation and GPCP observations, (e) as in (a) but for outgoing longwave \nradiation (OLR) and CERES observations, and (f) as in (a) but for net shortwave radiation at the top of the \natmosphere (TOA) and CERES observations.

\n\n1 Introduction \n\n1.1 Motivation and main goals \n\nNotwithstanding the considerable improvement in cloud and cloudy boundary layer \n\nparameterization in the last 20 years (e.g., Tiedtke 1993; Del Genio et al. 1996; Fowler et al. \n\n1996; Rasch and Kristj\u00e1nsson 1998; Lock et al. 2000; Lock 2001; Bony and Emanuel 2001; \n\nTeixeira and Hogan 2002; Tompkins 2002), the representation of clouds is still a challenge for \n\nthe weather and climate modelling communities (e.g., Teixeira 1999; Jakob 1999; Duynkerke \n\nand Teixeira 2001; Siebesma et al. 2004), thus underlining the continued need for \n\nobservational methods and campaigns targeted at different cloud systems, along with the \n\ndevelopment of cloud parameterization in GCMs (General Circulation Models). This urgency \n\nis reinforced by the fact that the amount of cloud generated by the models has a significant \n\nimpact on the predicted behaviour of the climate system (e.g., Cess et al. 1989; Slingo 1990). \n\nIn particular, current climate models tend to respond differently in climate change sensitivity \n\nexperiments, often showing diverging cloud-climate feedbacks, a situation explained, to a great \n\nextent, by significant differences in low (boundary layer) cloudiness (e.g., Bony et al. 2004; \n\nBony and Dufresne 2005; Bony et al. 2006; Wyant et al. 2006; Stephens 2005). \n\nParameterization deficiencies also result in thermodynamically inconsistent representation of \n\nthe hydrologic cycle, which has important implications in the simulation of the (sub)tropical \n\natmospheric circulation and its interplay with boundary layer and deep convection clouds (e.g., \n\nPhilander et al. 1996; Ma et al. 1996; Larson et al. 1999). \n\nThese topics are investigated by different GCSS (Global energy and water cycle experiment \n\nCloud System Study) working groups (boundary layer clouds, cirrus, frontal clouds, deep \n\nconvection, and polar clouds), which have been successful in defining and understanding \n\nfundamental cloud regimes (e.g., Duynkerke et al. 1999; Bretherton et al. 1999; Bechtold et al. \n\n2000; Redelsperger et al. 2000; Stevens et al. 2001; Randall et al. 2003; Siebesma et al. 2003), \n\nand in the development of new cloud and cloudy boundary layer parameterizations (e.g., \n\nCuijpers and Bechtold 1995; Lock et al. 2000; Golaz et al. 2002; Teixeira and Hogan 2002; \n\nCheinet and Teixeira 2003; Lenderink and Holtslag 2004; Bretherton et al. 2004b; Soares et al. \n\n2004; Bretherton and Park 2009). Traditionally, four main steps characterize the GCSS \n\nstrategy: i) creation of an observationally-based case study; ii) evaluation of CRM (Cloud-\n\n- 1 - \n\n\n\n-    Introduction    - \n\nResolving Model) and LES (Large-Eddy Simulation) models for the case study; iii) evaluation \n\nof parameterizations using SCMs (Single-Column Models); and iv) develop and improve \n\nparameterizations using the statistics from the CRM and LES models. \n\nHowever, the exclusive use of one-dimensional (SCM) versions of the atmospheric models \n\ndoes not allow a deep understanding of the fundamental role of clouds in climate (e.g., cloud-\n\nclimate feedbacks) owing to the fact that the large scale dynamics is prescribed in the SCM and \n\nCRM models. This implies that parameterization testing has to be done in the complete (3D \n\n[three-Dimensional]) versions of weather and climate prediction models, which potentially \n\nentails the analysis of very large amounts of model simulation data. In this context, the GPCI \n\n(Global energy and water cycle experiment cloud system study / working group on numerical \n\nexperimentation Pacific Cross-section Intercomparison) project offers a new and much lighter \n\napproach for the intercomparison of GCMs, by focusing the analysis on a reduced number of \n\nlocations along a cross section in a carefully chosen geographical region, allowing for a \n\nrelatively straightforward model and observational data integration. More precisely, the GPCI \n\napproach has, this far, been focused on the (sub)tropical NE Pacific ocean, although, in \n\ngeneral, suitable for other similar regions (e.g., in the SE Pacific). \n\nCloud parameterization development and improvement resorting to high temporal resolution \n\nmodel output to allow the evaluation of the representation of the diurnal cycle, and the \n\nexploration and validation of state-of-the-art observational datasets to understand different \n\ncloud regimes and the transitions between them, are at the core of GPCI\u2019s motivations. In the \n\nlong run this approach could also contribute to a better understanding of how the global \n\nchanges in precipitation, evaporation, and hydrologic cycle are taking place. \n\nHaving been developed in tight connection with the GPCI project, the investigation presented \n\nin this thesis was oriented along the lines of GPCI\u2019s main goals and scientific questions \n\n(Section 3.1.2). \n\n1.2 Outline \n\nThis thesis is divided into 8 main chapters. \n\nThe introductory chapter is followed by an overview of cloud climatology, cloud-related \n\nprocesses, and dedicated observational campaigns, given separately in a global, and in a \n\nregional perspective, with a special focus on (sub)tropical maritime low boundary-layer clouds. \n\nAlso in Chapter 2, a brief description is given of the main physical processes thought to impact \n\n- 2 - \n\n\n\n-    Introduction    - \n\nthe formation of low stratiform cloudiness over the subtropical oceans. The last section is \n\ndedicated to cloud parameterization, and presents a general view on some of the main aspects \n\nof the representation of clouds in numerical models. \n\nChapter 3 is dedicated to the GPCI project, and starts with some background, followed by the \n\nproject\u2019s main goals. The project protocol is detailed, and information is presented on the \n\nparticipating models, and observational datasets used in this work. The chapter closes with a \n\ndiscussion on the representativeness of the GPCI cross section and concludes on the robustness \n\nof the GPCI approach. \n\nThe fourth chapter, is focused on a preliminary analysis of GPCI model and observational data, \n\nand discusses the corresponding results with the goal to give an overview of the mean \n\ncharacteristics of the summertime atmospheric hydrologic cycle in the (sub)tropical NE \n\nPacific. Emphasis is also given to the vertical distribution of clouds, and to processes involving \n\ndynamical and environmental factors that play a role in the maintenance of total and low cloud \n\nfields on a seasonal time scale. \n\nAn in-depth analysis of convective regime transition, based on the spatiotemporal behaviour of \n\nclouds is attempted in Chapter 5, resorting to cloud data from model simulations, atmospheric \n\nreanalysis, and satellite observations. To gain insight into the question of the transition in \n\n(sub)tropical cloud regimes, several techniques are developed to detect the transitions, and or \n\nsummarize their main seasonal features. Additionally, a preliminary spectral analysis of the \n\nseasonal record of spatial shifts in the location of sharp gradients in cloud cover is performed, \n\nand a novel approach to clustering of spatial patterns is introduced, and subsequently applied to \n\ntotal cloud cover along the GPCI transect, with the final goal to indentify main spatiotemporal \n\nfeatures of the seasonal cloud cover, and compare associated environmental conditions. \n\nChapter 6 is dedicated to the study of the humidity structure in the GPCI region, with the goal \n\nto better understand its role as one of the main parameters in the context of the hydrologic \n\ncycle, particularly through its influence on cloud formation and evolution. State-of-the-art \n\nsatellite observations are analyzed along the cross section, together with model simulations and \n\natmospheric analyses. A number of results, based on the treatment of relative humidity data for \n\nthe summer season, are presented, namely, seasonal mean profiles, variance, temporal \n\nevolution, boundary-layer properties, and potential impact on cloudiness structure and \n\ntransition. The chapter introduces a new methodology for the determination of the top of the \n\nmaritime boundary layer, and updates the technique for the detection of abrupt changes in the \n\nspatial distribution of clouds initially presented in Chapter 5. \n\n- 3 - \n\n\n\n-    Introduction    - \n\nAs one of the main topics in GPCI, the representation, in weather and climate prediction \n\nmodels, of the diurnal variation of clouds and cloud-related parameters, is the focus in Chapter \n\n7. Three-hourly model output and observational data are used to characterize the diurnal cycle, \n\nas seen in seasonal means at different locations along the GPCI transect. Results are presented \n\nfor: atmospheric circulation associated with the large-scale dynamics in the Hadley-cell-\n\ndominated NE Pacific; a number of cloud-related vertically-distributed variables; and for June-\n\nJuly-August mean diurnal cycle anomalies at three specific locations in the cross section, \n\nrepresentative of the main cloud/convection regimes found in the region. \n\nThe main conclusions of this work are presented in Chapter 8, followed by a list of the \n\nbibliography referenced. \n\nA note on the contents of the CD-ROM with the appendixes to this work forms the Appendix, \n\nplaced at the end of the thesis. \n\n- 4 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\n2 Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans \n\nClouds are known to be an important regulator of the climate system. They interact with the \n\natmosphere in many ways, and influence its dynamic behaviour at different scales, from those \n\nat which they occur, to the global atmospheric circulation. Randall (1989) categorized the \n\ndirect effects of clouds on the atmosphere in three \u201ccloud forcing\u201d mechanisms: radiative \n\nforcing, latent forcing, and convective forcing. The radiative forcing (Ramanathan 1987) \n\ndescribes the clouds\u2019 modulation on the solar and terrestrial radiative fluxes; the latent forcing \n\ndescribes the effects of vaporization and condensation latent heat that occur in clouds and \n\nprecipitation; the convective forcing describes additional effects of heat, moisture, and \n\nmomentum transport in convective clouds, associated with latent heat release, but treated \n\nseparately from it. Through the combination of these three forcings, clouds profoundly \n\ninfluence the distribution of energy in the atmosphere, and the hydrologic cycle, and, therefore, \n\nthe large-scale atmospheric circulation. Despite all the current knowledge, clouds are still one \n\nof the biggest challenges in climate research. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n\n(IPCC) emphasized that one of the sources of uncertainty in global climate prediction is the \n\nincomplete knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the formation, dissipation, and radiative \n\nproperties of clouds (Houghton et al. 1990; Houghton et al. 1992; Solomon et al. 2007). \n\nThe next two sections of this chapter present an overview of cloud climatology, cloud-related \n\nprocesses, and dedicated observational campaigns, in global (Section 2.1), and in regional \n\n(Section 2.2) perspectives, with a special focus on (sub)tropical maritime low boundary-layer \n\nclouds. In Section 2.3, the main physical processes thought to impact the formation of low \n\nstratiform cloudiness over the subtropical oceans are briefly described. Section 2.4 (Cloud \n\nparameterization) gives a general view on some of the main aspects of the representation of \n\nclouds in numerical models. \n\n2.1 Global scale \n\nThe maritime atmospheric boundary layer (MBL) differs in many aspects from the atmospheric \n\nboundary layer (BL) over the continents. A few characteristics of the MBL, as compared to the \n\ncontinental BL, are typically highlighted, namely: a) the air close to the surface is moister, with \n\nrelative humidity in the range of 75 % to 100 %; b) the diurnal cycle tends to be weaker \n\n- 5 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\n(though not negligible); c) except close to the coast, the difference in temperature between the \n\nair and the surface tends to be small (as a result of radiative cooling the air is usually up to 2 K \n\ncooler than the surface water, with significant temperature differences resulting in vigorous \n\nconvection able to balance the effects of horizontal thermal advection [except in regions with \n\nstrong sea surface temperature contrast], which makes for a neutral surface layer over most \n\noceanic regions); d) more than 95 % of the global MBL has clouds, the exceptions being the \n\ncoastal areas where warm and dry continental air is advected over a colder ocean, and some \n\nregions (e.g., in the western boundaries of the subtropical oceans) where air is advected from \n\nareas with relatively high sea surface temperature (SST) to areas with lower SSTs. \n\nBoundary-layer clouds, or, in general, low clouds, occur frequently in the atmosphere, and are \n\nnotably abundant in the MBL. The fact that they cover large areas of the globe make them \n\nparticularly important for the radiative balance of the planet. A crucial climate topic is thus the \n\nunderstanding of the factors that control their abundance (e.g., Randall et al. 1984; Klein and \n\nHartmann 1993; Bony et al. 2004; Sandu et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2011). \n\nShallow cumulus (ShCu), stratus, stratocumulus (Sc), and nimbostratus are the most frequent \n\ncloud types in the BL. Recent investigation suggests that the Sc and ShCu play an important \n\nrole in the tropical and subtropical atmospheric circulation (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; \n\nSiebesma 1998; Larson et al. 1999). These two types of clouds are described in the next \n\nparagraphs. \n\nStratocumulus occurrence is particularly frequent over the oceanic regions and is generally \n\nassociated with subsidence conditions in the subtropical regions and mid-latitudes. This is \n\nparticularly notorious in subtropical regions in the eastern boundaries of the great oceans, \n\nwhere the descending branch of the Hadley cell circulation forces the subsidence of air over \n\nrelatively cold surface waters, e.g., the regions to the west of California (NE Pacific), Peru (SE \n\nPacific), Namibia (SE Atlantic), and Mauritania (NE Atlantic) (Hanson 1991; Klein and \n\nHartmann 1993; Ma et al. 1996). Also noteworthy is the formation of Sc that occur during the \n\nWinter over the warm current regions of the western boundary of the big ocean basins (e.g., \n\nKuroshio current [NW Pacific] and Gulf current [NW Atlantic]). In these regions, the contact \n\nof cold continental air masses with a relatively warm ocean surface results in strong heat and \n\nhumidity fluxes that increase the depth of the MBL and favor convection, in contrast to what \n\nhappens in the subtropical subsidence regions where convection is maintained by strong cloud-\n\ntop radiative cooling (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Bretherton et al. 2004a). A third type of \n\nlow stratiform clouds, Arctic stratus, forms essentially during the Summer, and, in many cases, \n\n- 6 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nresults from the radiative cooling of moist air reaching the Arctic from subpolar latitudes (e.g., \n\nHerman and Goody 1976; Curry et al. 1988). A unique characteristic of these stratus is the \n\ntendency to form multiple cloud layers, and the occurrence of humidity inversions with an \n\nincrease of moisture from the base to the top of the inversion layer. Other types of stratus \n\ninclude those that occur during the Summer in the SE China plateau, and the maritime Summer \n\nstratus of the mid-latitudes between 45\u00b0N and 60\u00b0N. \n\nSeveral observational campaigns and initiatives have been focused on improving the \n\nunderstanding of the Sc thermodynamic and turbulent structure, and chemistry, among them: \n\nFIRE (First International satellite cloud climatology project Regional Experiment [Albrecht et \n\nal. 1988]); ASTEX (Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition EXperiment [Albrecht et al. 1995]); and \n\nDYCOMS-II (the second Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus field study \n\n[Stevens et al. 2003]). These have provided important data for a number of subsequent studies \n\non Sc (e.g., Duynkerke and Driedonks 1987; Hignett 1991; Duynkerke and Teixeira 2001). \n\nMore recently the use of  Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) models has increased our \n\nunderstanding of fundamental mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of \n\nSc (e.g. Moeng et al. 1996; Stevens et al. 1998; Duynkerke et al., 1999). Climate research has \n\nreinforced the idea that Sc are important agents of its variability and dynamics (e.g., Philander \n\net al. 1996; Clement and Seager 1999; Bony and Dufresne 2005). \n\nAnother type of low cloud with an important presence in the BL, and typically associated with \n\nconvective boundary layer (CBL) situations is the ShCu. Its distribution affects on average, \n\nrespectively,  12 %, and 5 %, of the area over the oceans, and continents (Duynkerke 1998). \n\nOne peculiar aspect of ShCu is the fact that they typically occur in oceanic regions where the \n\ntrade winds prevail, in which case they are commonly known as the trade-wind cumulus. These \n\nclouds often make the transition between Sc-dominated regions and the ITCZ (Inter Tropical \n\nConvergence Zone) associated with the ascending branch of the Hadley cell. In the continental \n\nmid-latitudes ShCu are frequent during the Summer, and can evolve into cumulonimbus when \n\nconditions are favorable for deep convection. By intensifying the vertical transport of heat, \n\nmoisture, and momentum in the ITCZ, and contributing to the overall humidity and heat \n\ntransport in the Hadley cell system, ShCu exert a direct influence on the global atmospheric \n\ncirculation and hydrologic cycle (e.g., Tiedtke 1987; Siebesma 1998). ShCu also posses \n\nradiative properties that indirectly affect the radiative balance of the planet (e.g., Ackerman et \n\nal. 1981; Marshak et al. 1995). \n\n- 7 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nAmong the observational campaigns and initiatives dedicated to ShCu are: BOMEX (Barbados \n\nOceanographic and Meteorological EXperiment [Kuettner and Holland 1969]); SCMS (Small \n\nCumulus Microphysics Study [French et al. 1999]); ARM (Atmospheric Radiation \n\nMeasurement [Brown et al. 2002]); and RICO (Rain In shallow Cumulus over the Ocean \n\n[Rauber et al. 2007]). Data from these campaigns were used in a number of research works \n\n(e.g., Warner 1977; Smith and Jonas 1995; De Roode and Duynkerke 1997). As with Sc, LES \n\nmodels are extensively used for the investigation of the CBL with ShCu (e.g., Sommeria 1976; \n\nSiebesma and Cuijpers 1995; Neggers et al. 2004). \n\nFigure 2.1 presents an annual climatology of the global distribution of low stratiform clouds \n\n(stratus, stratocumulus, and fog) obtained from surface observations. In the next section, the \n\nfocus is on the regional characterization of the cloud systems that typically occur close to the \n\neastern boundaries of the big oceans, including the kind of low boundary-layer clouds whose \n\nregional maxima can be seen in Fig. 2.1 off the coasts of California, Peru, and Namibia. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - Annual mean global distribution of low stratiform clouds (stratus, stratocumulus, and fog) obtained \nfrom surface observations (from Klein and Hartmann 1993). \n\n2.2 Regional scale \n\nThe global distribution of low stratiform clouds patent in Fig. 2.1 clearly puts in evidence one \n\nof the most characteristic aspects of this type of clouds: the persistence of their occurrence to \n\nthe east of the maritime subtropical anticyclones. Climatologically, these regions are marked \n\nby the presence of the (easterly) trade winds blowing (from the mid-latitudes) in the direction \n\nof the ITCZ. As mentioned in the previous section, stratus clouds form over the ocean in areas \n\nwith relatively low SST, and below a strong temperature inversion at the top of the MBL. The \n\ninversion layer, also present in the trades, is maintained by the subsidence associated with the \n\n- 8 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\ndescending branch of the Hadley circulation and imposes a (vertical) limit to stratiform \n\nconvection forcing the clouds to stay relatively low (there is some evidence of a possible \n\nrelation between the intensity of the temperature inversion and the amount of stratus in the \n\nMBL). The inversion strength is linked to the intensity of the Hadley cell, which, in turn is, in \n\npart, determined by deep convection in the tropics (Klein and Hartmann 1993). As the trades \n\napproach the ITCZ, and higher SSTs, the inversion layer gradually deepens and the \n\ntemperature inversion becomes less pronounced. This is usually accompanied by an increase in \n\nconvection activity resulting in the formation of cumulus clouds that become dominant to the \n\ndetriment of stratiform clouds. The mechanisms behind this transition are a current topic of \n\ninvestigation (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2010; Sandu et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2011). An illustration \n\nof the basic interplay between the boundary layer clouds, the SST and the large-scale \n\natmospheric circulation in thermally direct circulations such as the Hadley (/Walker) cell, is \n\ngiven in Fig. 2.2, with deep precipitating cumulus towers found (in the ITCZ / western tropical \n\noceans) over warm waters near the equator (EQ) as mediators of the ascending branch of the \n\ndirect circulation(s); stratocumulus clouds covering the relatively cold (eastern) subtropical \n\noceans under the influence of the subsiding branch of the large-scale, and land/sea circulations; \n\nand trade-wind cumulus in between, in concomitance with a deepening of the MBL (as \n\nmentioned in the previous section, ShCu play an important role in the transport of heat and \n\nhumidity that contributes to fuel the Hadley circulation). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 - Illustration of the main cloud regimes associated with thermally direct circulations between the \ntropics, and the subtropics of the eastern boundaries of the main oceanic basins (EQ for equator) (from Stevens \n\n2005). \n\nIn the specific case of the Pacific region close to California, the conditions for the occurrence \n\nof stratocumulus during the Summer season seem to include a well defined subtropical \n\nanticyclone, trade winds blowing equatorward with divergence indicative of strong subsidence, \n\n- 9 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nand a sharp temperature inversion at the top of a well mixed ~ 1000 m deep MBL (e.g., Klein \n\nand Hartmann 1993). A qualitative analysis of these aspects is given in the next paragraphs. \n\nNote firstly, that, an intense subtropical anticyclone is favorable to an increase of BL \n\ncloudiness, since, along with increased subsidence, steadiness of the wind field, and advection \n\nof relatively cooler air, it dries the troposphere, and limits the disrupting influence mid-latitude \n\ncyclones have on the BL processes. Moreover, it seems that atmospheric circulation changes \n\nforce SST variations, probably through the effects on the energy balance of the ocean mixing \n\nlayer, of the conjunction of stronger surface winds, more vigorous surface fluxes, and cloud \n\ncover (Klein et al. 1995). It should be kept in mind, however, that it is inadequate to think of \n\nlow clouds as being solely related with SST; in that point of view it would be tempting to infer \n\nthe existence of a global climatic feedback from the negative correlation between low clouds \n\nand SST that happens in certain circumstances. There is no clear indication of such a feedback \n\n(e.g., Hartmann and Michelsen 1993; Klein et al. 1995; Bony et al. 1997). \n\nConcerning, more specifically, the link between the strength of the inversion at the top of the \n\nMBL and stratiform cloud cover, the question is on its physical meaning. It is believed that the \n\npresence of the inversion layer forces the moisture that evaporates from the ocean surface to \n\naccumulate in the MBL and, eventually, reach saturation. Once a cloud is formed, convection \n\nis easily maintained, essentially owing to strong cloud-top radiative cooling (in the absence of \n\nclouds at higher levels, and, particularly, if the overlying free troposphere is relatively dry). \n\nUnder these conditions the cloud will remain confined to the MBL because the inversion layer \n\nhinders its vertical (convective) development. It can then be concluded that an inversion layer \n\nis a necessary condition for the formation of (subtropical) MBL stratus. Still, it would be \n\nimprudent go much further and make a direct link between changes in inversion strength and \n\nchanges in stratiform cloud cover. Another related aspect is the existence in the subtropical \n\nregions of a possible link between stratus and low tropospheric (static) stability (LTS, defined \n\nas the difference between the potential temperature at 700 hPa and at the surface). A positive \n\nfeedback between both has even been suggested (Hanson 1991). In fact, this type of clouds \n\nhelp maintain the MBL relatively cool through longwave radiative cooling and scattering of \n\nshortwave energy from the Sun. This may cause an increase of the static stability, which can, \n\nin turn, be potentially responsible for a subsequent increase in stratus, and so on. The efficacy \n\nof such a feedback has to be evaluated taking into account that the MBL temperature is, to a \n\ngreat extent, determined by the SST. Knowing that the big heat capacity of the ocean implies \n\nthat the SST is relatively unaffected by radiation changes (at least in shorter time scales), limits \n\n- 10 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nthe effectiveness of the proposed feedback (Klein and Hartmann 1993). In any case, it should \n\nbe stressed that the association between stratus and static stability does not necessarily imply a \n\ncausal relation (in any direction). Nevertheless, some studies have shown a significant link \n\nbetween maritime low cloud cover and measures of atmospheric vertical stability in the MBL. \n\nKlein and Hartmann\u2019s (1993) conclusions were drawn from the analysis of large areas of the \n\nmaritime subtropics at the seasonal scale, showing a strong relation with LTS, while Wood and \n\nBretherton (2006) showed improved connections using a variant of LTS, the estimated \n\ninversion strength (EIS). \n\nObservations suggest that, there is, in the NE Pacific and similar regions, a relation between \n\nthe behaviour of the cloud cover at a given location and environmental conditions the \n\ncorresponding air mass experienced upwind along the trajectory of the trades. An immediate \n\nconclusion is the need to adopt a Lagrangean perspective to follow the history of the MBL \n\natmospheric flow and understand its implications for the cloudiness (e.g., Klein et al. 1995; \n\nMauger and Norris 2010). In that case, the prediction of MBL cloud properties in GCMs \n\n(General Circulation Models) must take into account, not only local boundary conditions, but \n\nalso, the meteorological history of the MBL air. This points to the need for prognostic, instead \n\nof diagnostic, MBL cloud parameterization schemes (e.g., Tiedtke 1993). \n\nRegarding the cloud transition that happens in the trades downwind from the regional Sc \n\nmaximum, it has been mentioned that it is associated with a deeper MBL and with SSTs higher \n\nthan those found in the Sc-dominated areas. In the transition region the stratiform clouds tend \n\nto be confined to a relatively thin layer immediately below the inversion layer, and are \n\ntypically decoupled from the surface as a source of moisture, except during the presence of \n\ncumulus associated with intermittent convection (e.g., Bretherton 1992; Klein et al. 1995). \n\nAdditional data on the thickness and temperature contrast of the inversion indicate that, as the \n\nMBL height increases, the intensity of the inversion, defined as the combination of those two \n\nquantities (Neiburger et al. 1961), decreases, which allows for an easier entrainment on the \n\nMBL of relatively dry air from the free troposphere above it. The combined effect of the \n\ndecoupling from the surface and of the thinning of the stratiform cloud layer, is, by itself, \n\nresponsible for an increased efficacy of the cloud dissipation by solar energy absorption, and, \n\nconsequently, favors larger diurnal variations of cloud cover. This enhanced diurnal cycle of \n\nlow cloudiness in the Sc-to-ShCu transition areas was observed during ASTEX (Albrecht et al. \n\n1995). \n\n- 11 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nHowever, the mechanism responsible for the restoration of the stratiform cloud layer, that \n\noccurs during the night, is less clear. The humidity flux associated with intermittent convective \n\nclouds could contribute for the renewal of the stratus layer in parts of the region where \n\nconvection coexists with thin stratus, but, in regions where the diurnal cycle is more \n\npronounced, there seems to be the need for an additional mechanism. A possible candidate is \n\nthe nocturnal substitution of air heated during the day, by the advection of colder and saturated \n\nair from upwind (e.g. Wang et al. 1993). \n\nFinally, since low clouds have a much more significant effect on top of the atmosphere \n\nshortwave radiative fluxes than on longwave radiative fluxes, the diurnal variations of the \n\ncloud cover associated with this type of clouds are particularly important to estimate cloud-\n\ninduced changes in the planetary radiative balance. Seasonal variations of the diurnal cycle \n\nshow that the largest diurnal cycle amplitudes occur during the summer months in both \n\nhemispheres (Rozendaal et al. 1995). \n\n2.3 Physical processes \n\nIn Fig. 2.3, the key processes discussed above, whose interplay is thought to contribute to the \n\nformation, maintenance, and breakup of low stratiform cloudiness in the (subtropical) MBL, \n\nare illustrated. In addition, Fig. 2.3 introduces intermittent drizzle, longwave heating, and \n\nmicrophysical variability as fundamental factors for understanding cloud and cloudy boundary \n\nlayer evolvement. A quick summary of the main physical processes and how they compete in \n\ndetermining the phenomenology of the cloudy MBL is given in the next paragraphs. \n\nThe longwave cloud-top radiative cooling is, to a great extent, responsible for driving the \n\nconvective turbulence in the MBL, but also spurs turbulent entrainment of relatively warm and \n\ndry air from the overlying free troposphere. This entrainment tends to result in a deepening of \n\nthe MBL, against the large-scale subtropical subsidence. The radiative cooling is counteracted \n\nby entrainment warming, and surface heat fluxes, while the drying effect of cloud-top \n\nentrainment is counteracted by surface moisture fluxes (e.g., DYCOMS-II [Stevens et al. \n\n2003]; Stevens 2005). \n\nConcerning the humidity structure of the free troposphere, the greater the moisture content of \n\nthe overlying environment, the more downwelling longwave radiation will be felt at cloud top. \n\nThis can offset the longwave radiative cooling, and potentially lead to a decrease of convective \n\nturbulence associated with cloud-top cooling. Such a situation tends to favor the decoupling of \n\n- 12 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nthe cloud layer from the surface as a source of moisture (Bretherton and Wyant 1997; Stevens \n\n2000), and may result in a thinning of the stratiform clouds. On the other hand, if a moist \n\noverlying environment extends all the way down to the cloud level, the potential reduction of \n\nthe drying of the cloud layer due to the entrainment of overlying (in this case relatively moist) \n\nair may, overall, counteract the effects of the aforementioned decoupling, and even favor cloud \n\nformation (e.g., Sandu et al. 2010). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Schematic representation of the physical and dynamical processes that affect the cloud-topped \nmaritime boundary layer (adapted from Garratt 1992). \n\nAnother mechanism that may contribute to the breakup of this type of cloud layer, known as \n\ncloud-top entrainment instability (CTEI, Lilly 1968; Randall 1980; Deardorff 1980; Siems \n\n1991, Kawai and Teixeira 2010), is thought to take place when subsaturated air, entrained in \n\nthe cloud layer, is subsequently cooled by evaporation to the point of becoming negatively \n\nbuoyant. The consequence is, potentially, the enhancement of the turbulent entrainment of \n\nmore subsaturated air, in a positive feedback that ultimately results in a thinning, and eventual \n\nbreakup, of the cloud layer (Yamaguchi and Randall [2008], question the effectiveness of this \n\nfeedback as being responsible for cloud dissipation). It is also possible that the combination of \n\n(intermittent) drizzle (e.g., Paluch and Lenschow 1991) and latent heat release in the cloud \n\nlayer (Bretherton and Wyant 1997), leads to MBL decoupling conditions, if they happen to \n\n- 13 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\noffset the effects of cloud-top radiative cooling on the convective turbulence. Once again, the \n\ncloud layer would undergo a thinning and, possibly, breakup. \n\nAs previously mentioned, thinner cloud layers are more prone to dissipation by solar energy \n\nabsorption (shortwave radiative heating). This situation favors relatively large diurnal \n\nvariations of cloud cover in regions where these thinner cloud layers tend to be more abundant \n\n(e.g., the Sc-to-ShCu transition areas of the maritime subtropics). \n\nA deeper understanding of the interplay between the physical processes presented above, and \n\nof its modulation by the large-scale dynamics and environmental conditions, is crucial for the \n\nimprovement of the numerical representation of clouds. \n\n2.4 Cloud parameterization \n\nIn the first attempts at climate simulation with GCMs, clouds were prescribed. Their \n\ndistribution was then usually introduced in the models as climatological values of zonal means, \n\nignoring its spatiotemporal variation (e.g. Holloway and Manabe 1971). An important step \n\nforward in cloud modelling happened with the inclusion of the effects of important parameters \n\nsuch as relative humidity, vertical velocity, and static stability in the numerical schemes for the \n\nrepresentation of clouds. That resulted in a more realistic simulation of cloud-related \n\nproperties. The following paragraphs present a brief overview of some of the main topics of \n\nGCM cloud parameterization. \n\nA fundamental aspect of atmospheric modelling is the difference between the two basic \n\ncomponents of a GCM, the (large-scale) dynamics component, and the physics \n\n(parameterization) component. While the equations that govern the dynamics are well known \n\n(e.g., Navier-Stokes equations of motion), the lack of previously established equations for most \n\nof the physics, requires the use of (elaborate) conceptual schemes. This is, primarily, due to the \n\nfact that a number of physical process, such as, the ones associated with radiative transfer, \n\nturbulent mixing, orographic forcing, moist convection, surface fluxes, or clouds, which have a \n\nsignificant impact on the large-scale circulation, occur at spatial scales smaller than those \n\ntypically resolved by atmospheric models. It is the need to somehow represent the effects on \n\nthe atmospheric flow of these subscale mechanisms that is behind the development of \n\nparameterization schemes. Or, in other words, the combined influence of the subscale \n\nprocesses needs to be formulated in terms of the basic variables resolved by the models. The \n\n- 14 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nsimulation of boundary layer clouds by a GCM relies on a delicate balance between the \n\ndifferent physical processes parameterized. \n\nThree main types of cloud parameterization schemes have been used in climate and weather \n\nprediction models for some time: i) empirical \u201cdiagnostic\u201d parameterizations in which the \n\ncloud cover is diagnosed as a function of relative humidity and some additional variables (e.g., \n\nSlingo 1980); ii) parameterizations in which cloud cover and cloud water are diagnosed based \n\nin the probability distribution of the subscale variability of thermodynamic variables \u2013 PDF \n\n(Probability Density Function)-based cloud schemes (e.g., Mellor 1977; Sommeria and \n\nDeardorff 1977); iii) \u201cprognostic\u201d parameterizations for liquid/solid water and or for the cloud \n\ncover (e.g., Sundqvist 1988; Tiedtke 1993). \n\nThe scheme proposed by Slingo (1980) is essentially based on the diagnostic relations between \n\ncloud cover and relative humidity. One of the main goals of the scheme was then try to \n\nrepresent stratocumulus in a realistic way, given their known importance in the climate system. \n\nThis was one of the reasons why diagnostic information about the strength of the inversion at \n\nthe BL-top was also included in the cloud cover parameterization. The link between the \n\namount of stratiform clouds and the intensity of the inversion, briefly described in the previous \n\nsections for the subtropical latitudes, is based on observational data (e.g., von Ficker 1936; \n\nKlein and Hartmann 1993) whose climatology indicates that, except in the Arctic region, the \n\nseason with more stratus is simultaneously the one for which the low troposphere static \n\nstability is the highest. However, there is in this diagnostic scheme the possibility of a strong \n\npositive feedback, since the cloud-top radiative cooling intensifies the inversion which, in turn, \n\nresults in an increase in the amount of cloud, and so on. Slingo (1987) discusses this feedback \n\nin view of observations that suggest its occurrence in the BL. Notwithstanding, the \n\nparameterization scheme proposed by Slingo was probably the first one able to (with GCMs) \n\nrealistically simulate cloud cover associated with stratocumulus. \n\nContrary to Slingo\u2019s diagnostic scheme, developed for GCMs, the Sommeria-Deardorff-Mellor \n\n(1977) scheme was initially applied in CSRMs (Cloud-System-Resolving Models) of the BL. \n\nOnly later they were used in GCMs (e.g., Smith 1984). This scheme is based on the statistical \n\ndescription of subscale condensation processes. In its original paper, Sommeria and Deardorff \n\n(1977) proposed a scheme in which it was needed to evaluate double integrals, while Mellor \n\n(1977) demonstrated that the problem could be reduced to integration in a single variable. \n\nPDF-based parameterizations constitute, theoretically, an ideal framework for the development \n\nof subscale cloud parameterizations, and for the coupling of its sources and dissipative \n\n- 15 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nprocesses with parameterization schemes for convection and turbulence. Additionally, owing \n\nto the intrinsically continuous nature of a PDF, the problems with discontinuities, affecting \n\nmany of the current cloud parameterization packages that deal with physical processes with \n\nassociated critical limits (thresholds), can be avoided. The biggest issue with these methods is, \n\nhowever, the determination of the characteristics of the PDF itself, for different situations and \n\ncloud types. Some studies have showed that a careful choice of the probability distributions for \n\neach specific case yields good results, thus indicating the large applicability of this kind of \n\nschemes. See, for instance, the results of the investigation of the subtropical Sc-to-ShCu \n\ntransition in Bechtold et al. (1995), and Cuijpers and Bechtold (1995). \n\nA statistical scheme presents some advantages when compared to a prognostic scheme, \n\nprimarily, because it is based on, fairly solid, physical and mathematical concepts, but also \n\nbecause it is diagnostic, thus needing less computational memory and being less prone to \n\nnumerical instability. However, the implementation of these parameterizations in GCMs can be \n\nsomewhat difficult, given the complexity of some of its components. Lastly, there is also the \n\nproblem with the representation of other types of clouds other than the ones associated with the \n\nBL, for which the scheme has been validate (e.g., Teixeira 2000). \n\nThe implementation of prognostic schemes in GCMs is relatively recent. Until 1991, cloud \n\nprognostic schemes treated cloud cover through diagnostic relations (e.g., Sundqvist 1988). \n\nDuring that same year an alternative prognostic scheme for the cloud cover was firstly \n\nproposed (Tiedtke 1991; Tiedtke 1993). The scheme was inspired by the need to link the \n\nsources of liquid water and cloud cover to convection, and, essentially, consists of two \n\nprognostic equations, one for the liquid/solid water (allowing both to coexist), and the other \n\none for cloud cover. In the scheme, the cloud production and dissipation (including BL clouds) \n\nis linked to the parameterized physical processes (convection, vertical movement, radiative \n\nheating, turbulence), which is desirable, and allows the representation of the main feedback \n\nprocesses among them. However, the intricacy of this link imposes added difficulty to the \n\nevaluation of the scheme\u2019s global performance, since errors in a certain component can be \n\nreflected on the parameters associated with cloud cover, which, in turn, will, potentially, be felt \n\nin the rest of the model (e.g., Jakob 1999). \n\nAn important limitation to the GCMs\u2019 ability of correctly representing clouds, is the vertical \n\nresolution adopted. It is well known that a realistic representation of the BL processes requires \n\nan adequate vertical resolution in the lower troposphere and, particularly, at the level of the \n\ninversion layer at the top of the BL. To tackle that issue, in addition to variable vertical \n\n- 16 - \n\n\n\n-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - \n\nresolution, there is the need for adaptative grids able to adjust themselves to an inversion \n\nknown to have  important spatiotemporal variation (as discussed in the previous sections). \n\nAnother important issue has to do with the fact that the different parameterization schemes that \n\ncomprise the physics of a GCM, differ from each other in terms of the layers of the atmosphere \n\nwere, ideally, they need higher vertical resolution (e.g. van Meijgaard and van Ulden 1998; \n\nLenderink and Holtslag 2000). \n\n- 17 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\n3 The  GPCI project \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe importance of atmospheric model intercomparison in climate studies was emphasized in \n\n1989 by the Joint Scientific Committee (JSC) of the World Climate Research Program \n\n(WCRP). There was then the need for more comprehensive and standardized climate model \n\nintercomparison efforts. In 1992 the JSC endorsed the creation of GCSS (Global energy and \n\nwater cycle experiment [GEWEX] Cloud System Study) as a long term program (Browning et \n\nal. 1993; Browning et al. 1994; Randall et al. 2003). GPCI (Global energy and water cycle \n\nexperiment cloud system study / working group on numerical experimentation Pacific Cross-\n\nsection Intercomparison) was established in 2004 and joined GCSS a year later (Teixeira et al. \n\n2008a; Teixeira et al. 2011). GPCI is part of the GCSS\u2019s GCM (General Circulation Model) \n\ncommunity and is dedicated to the intercomparison of three-dimensional (3D) global and \n\nregional models. \n\n3.1.1 Background \n\nThe GPCI project can be seen as a follow-up to the 3D model intercomparison performed \n\nunder the European Cloud Systems Study (EUROCS) along a similar cross section in the \n\n(sub)tropical NE Pacific ocean (Siebesma et al. 2004). The focus was on the June-July-August \n\n(JJA) season, but only monthly means at four times during the day were available during \n\nEUROCS. Although meaningful conclusions on model deficiencies could be drawn, the coarse \n\ntemporal resolution didn\u2019t allow for a detailed study of the diurnal cycle. Moreover, there was \n\na lack of observational data with which to validate important aspects of the model simulations, \n\nsuch as the vertical structure of tropospheric temperature and humidity, which had to be \n\nevaluated solely against reanalysis data (known to have limitations, especially over remote \n\nareas of the global oceans). \n\nAs will be seen below in more detail, at the core of GPCI\u2019s setup and project protocol is a \n\nrequest for high temporal resolution 3-hourly model output, and observational data. Also a step \n\nfurther from EUROCS is the recent availability of satellite retrievals of the vertical structure of \n\nimportant cloud-related parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, cloud occurrence) from a new \n\n- 18 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\ngeneration of sensors and platforms (e.g., AIRS [Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder], and \n\nCloudSat). \n\nFinally, GPCI is open to the participation of a larger number of atmospheric modelling centers, \n\nincluding American institutions (not present in EUROCS). Also, the inclusion in GPCI of more \n\nrecent model versions from the centers that participated in EUROCS will allow for an \n\nevaluation of the respective model development efforts. \n\n3.1.2 Main goals \n\nAs part of the GCSS community, the main goal of GPCI is to characterize deficiencies in the \n\nrepresentation of (sub)tropical clouds and cloud-related processes in climate and weather \n\nprediction models, with an emphasis on different cloud and convection regimes and on the \n\ntransitions between them. The GPCI framework is specifically set up for the investigation of \n\nthree fundamental cloud regimes that typically occur over the eastern boundaries of the \n\n(sub)tropical oceans, namely, stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep cumulus. Knowledge \n\ngained from a detailed analysis of the behaviour of these cloud systems, and associated \n\ndynamical and thermodynamical environments, in models and observations should offer \n\ninsight for the improvement and development of new parameterizations of clouds, boundary \n\nlayer, and convection.  \n\nA number of core scientific questions guide the progression of the GPCI activities, among \n\nthem: what controls the diurnal cycle of cloud properties over the (sub)tropical oceans?; how \n\ndo models represent these processes?; what is the humidity structure in the subtropical upper \n\ntroposphere?; can models simulate it?; can the current tools for model diagnostic and \n\nvalidation, and available observational data, reveal the deficiencies in the cloud, convection, \n\nand boundary layer parameterizations used in state-of-the-art climate and weather prediction \n\nmodels?; how to make GPCI results a reference point for future model development efforts? \n\nTo answer these questions GPCI is, at the present stage, primarily focused on: ? gathering \n\nmodel and observational data for the JJA season in the GPCI geographical location; ? \n\ndeveloping and exploring methodologies for the study of important (sub)tropical cloud regimes \n\n(stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep convection) and respective transitions; ? evaluating \n\nmodels and observations for a characterization of the hydrologic cycle; ? understanding the \n\nrole of the interplay between the large-scale dynamics and environmental factors in the \n\nbehaviour of the different cloud regimes; ? using and validating the newest generations of \n\ncloud-related satellite datasets, namely in what concerns the vertical structure of temperature, \n\n- 19 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\nhumidity, and clouds; ? describing the (maritime) atmospheric boundary layer representation \n\nin models and in observations; and ? helping the participating centers in the development new \n\nparameterizations. \n\nThe GPCI approach has already proven useful in the fulfillment of some of these goals (e.g., \n\nTeixeira et al. 2008a; Karlsson et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2011). \n\n3.2 Setup \n\n3.2.1 The NE Pacific Summer \n\nGiven GPCI\u2019s main goals summarized above (Section 3.1.2), and the fact that the project \n\nenvisioned the participation of a large number of modelling centers and the extensive use of a \n\nvariety of observational datasets, there was the need to focus the investigation on a confined \n\ngeographical area to avoid a computationally demanding data treatment and analysis. This, and \n\nthe desire to include in the study fundamental (sub)tropical cloud systems, led to the choice of \n\nthe (sub)tropical NE Pacific ocean region. In fact, the large-scale and environmental conditions \n\nfound in the NE Pacific area, can, in general, be found in similar regions of the eastern \n\nboundaries of the (sub)tropical oceans (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Sandu et al. 2010). \n\nMore specifically, the GPCI region is confined between -5\u00baN to 45\u00baN and 160\u00baE to 120\u00baW, an \n\narea from the coast of California to the Equator, previously the focus of a number of studies of \n\nthe maritime boundary-layer clouds and cloud-related processes (e.g., Riehl et al. 1951; Klein \n\nand Hartmann 1993; Fetzer et al. 2004; Siebesma et al. 2004; Karlsson et al. 2010; Sandu et al. \n\n2010; Teixeira et al. 2011). In terms of the large-scale dynamics, the phenomenology in the \n\nregion is dominated by the Hadley circulation, with deep convection in the inter-tropical \n\nconvergence zone (ITCZ), and large-scale subsidence in the subtropics. Fundamental cloud \n\nregimes of interest for the GCSS can be found in this oceanic region reasonably well separated \n\nin three main cloud regimes, namely, stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep cumulus, \n\noften showing characteristic cloudiness transition behaviour. The mean circulation in the \n\nregion allows a study of the main features associated with the cloud phenomenology resorting \n\nonly to individual cross sections aligned parallel to the low level trajectories of the atmospheric \n\nflow (see Section 3.5 Representativeness of the cross-section). Moreover, the persistency of a \n\nrelatively well defined Hadley circulation implies that meaningful conclusions can be taken \n\nfrom the investigation of a time period of only a few months. Choosing JJA as the study period \n\nis, in part, based on: i) the fact that this season typically exhibits small sea surface temperature \n\n- 20 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\n(SST) anomaly in the region (1 K to 2 K, overall [see Fig. 4.1]); ii) it is the season of \n\nmaximum occurrence of low clouds (Fig. 3.1); and iii) because the diurnal cycle presents its \n\npeak amplitude during the summertime (e.g., Rozendaal et al. 1995). \n\nFigure 3.1 illustrates the location of the GPCI cross section in the NE Pacific from the coast of \n\nCalifornia to the equatorial region, superimposed on a JJA climatology of the low (boundary \n\nlayer) cloud cover obtained from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) \n\nobservational data. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Representation of the GCSS/WGNE Pacific cross section (black diagonal line), and ISCCP low cloud \ncover (%) climatology for the June-July-August season (courtesy Dr. Cecile Hannay). \n\n3.2.2 Project protocol \n\nGPCI can be seen as a level-2 model intercomparison project (Gates 1992) in which all the \n\nparticipating models have to follow the same line of predefined project specifications and \n\nprotocols: i) simulations made under standard conditions; ii) common diagnostics in standard \n\nformat; and iii) validation against common data. \n\nThough standardized, the specifications are kept at a relatively generic level with the basic \n\ncondition being that the models run in climate mode (i.e., without data assimilation) and using \n\nprescribed SSTs as boundary condition. As the period of interest is the JJA season (1998 and \n\n2003), it is advised that the numeric simulations begin by the 20th of May. The requested \n\noutput corresponds to the period between the 1st of June and the 31st of August. Regarding the \n\ngeographical area of interest, it is requested that model data be sent for: i) 13 locations along \n\nthe GPCI cross section, starting at 35\u00baN, 125\u00baW and moving southwestwards at 4\u00ba longitude \n\nand 3\u00ba latitude steps until -1\u00baN, 173\u00baW; ii) locations every 5 \u00d7 5 degrees in a grid ranging from \n\n-5\u00baN to 45\u00baN and 160\u00baE to 240\u00baE (referred to below as the 2D maps). Finally, the simulation \n\n- 21 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\nresults are to be submitted in high temporal resolution (every 3 hours at 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, \n\n18, and 21 UTC), and at full vertical resolution, i.e., on model levels. \n\nThe following is a list of the different variables of the GPCI standard output. \n\nVertical profiles as a function of pressure (10 parameters): pressure (hPa), potential \n\ntemperature (K), specific humidity (g/kg), relative humidity (%), zonal wind (m/s), meridional \n\nwind (m/s), vertical velocity (Pa/s), cloud cover (%), liquid water content (g/kg), ice water \n\ncontent (g/kg). \n\nSingle-level variables (18 parameters): sea surface temperature (K), outgoing longwave \n\nradiation (W/m2), surface downward longwave radiation (W/m2), net shortwave radiation at the \n\ntop of the atmosphere (W/m2), surface net shortwave radiation (W/m2), surface downward \n\nshortwave radiation (W/m2), surface latent heat flux (W/m2), surface sensible heat flux (W/m2), \n\ntotal cloud cover (%), total column water vapour (kg/m2), liquid water path (g/m2), ice water \n\npath (g/m2), convective precipitation (mm/d), stratiform precipitation (mm/d), top of the \n\natmosphere net clear sky shortwave radiation (W/m2), top of the atmosphere clear sky \n\nlongwave radiation (W/m2), surface net clear sky shortwave radiation (W/m2), surface net clear \n\nsky longwave radiation (W/m2). \n\n2D maps (for 7 parameters): outgoing longwave radiation (W/m2), precipitation (mm/day), \n\ntotal cloud cover (%), total column water vapour (kg/m2), liquid water path (g/m2), relative \n\nhumidity at 850 hPa (%), relative humidity at 200 hPa (%), vertical velocity at 300 hPa (Pa/s), \n\nvertical velocity at 700 hPa (Pa/s). \n\n3.3 Participating models \n\nOver twenty weather and climate prediction organizations have joined GPCI, sending model \n\nsimulation output following the specifications of the project protocol presented above (Section \n\n3.2.2).

In fact, satellite observations have been a crucial tool for recent \n\nprogress in the understanding of clouds as key players in the climate system (e.g., Ramanathan \n\net al. 1989; Harrison et al. 1990; Rossow and Schiffer 1991; Rossow and Schiffer 1999; \n\nWielicki et al. 1995; Chylek et al. 2007), and for the validation of climate and weather \n\nprediction models (e.g., Cess et al. 1997; Webb et al. 2001; Randall et al. 2003; Zhang et al. \n\n2005). \n\nA collection of satellite data has been prepared for GPCI by the GCSS Data Integration for \n\nModel Evaluation (DIME) initiative. These datasets include high temporal resolution data from \n\n- 23 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\nthe International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), together with daily products \n\nfrom the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), the Global Precipitation Climatology \n\nProject (GPCP), and the Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) Operational \n\nVertical Sounder (TOVS). Given it\u2019s 3-hourly temporal resolution, the ISCCP cloud data has \n\nbeen particularly useful  in the study of cloud regime transitions in the GPCI region. Note, \n\nhowever, that the model total cloud cover simulations have, this far, been directly compared \n\nagainst ISCCP total cloud cover information, without resort to the ISCCP simulator (Klein and \n\nJakob 1999; Webb et al. 2001), a tool that converts cloud-related information from the models \n\ninto ISCCP cloud properties (cloud top pressure, cloud amount, and cloud optical thickness). \n\nNo ISCCP simulator output was requested because many of the participating centers had not \n\nimplemented the tool in their respective models. \n\nIn fact, the bulk of the observational data used in this study was retrieved from the GCSS-\n\nDIME Web site in formats prepared for the GPCI project area of interest: see \u201cCROSS-PAC\u201d \n\nand \u201cGPCI\u201d at http://gcss-dime.giss.nasa.gov/. CERES (Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy \n\nSystem) ES9 (Earth Radiation Budget Experiment [ERBE]-like Science product 9) data were \n\nobtained from the Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC) at the National Aeronautics and \n\nSpace Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center (http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/). The \n\nSSM/I data and images are produced by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and sponsored by the \n\nNASA Pathfinder Program for early Earth Observing System (EOS) products. SSM/I is \n\nonboard polar orbiting satellites, property of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program \n\n(DMSP). Retrievals from three DMSP satellites carrying SSM/I (F11, F13, and F14) \n\noperational during JJA 1998 were used. RSS SSM/I can be found online at \n\nhttp://www.remss.com/ssmi/ssmi_description.html. The GPCP dataset combines precipitation \n\ninformation from several sources. Microwave estimates are based on SSM/I, infrared (IR) \n\nprecipitation estimates are obtained from geostationary satellites and polar-orbiting satellites, \n\nand gauge data are assembled and analyzed by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre \n\n(GPCC). A hierarchy of geostationary (GOES [Geostationary Operational Environmental \n\nSatellite], GMS [Geosynchronous Meteorological Satellite], Meteosat) and polar orbiting \n\n(NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]) satellites are used by ISCCP to \n\nretrieve and calculate cloud related products. \n\nOther important observational datasets used in GPCI are opportunely described in following \n\nsections of this thesis, whenever specifically applied for model evaluation, these include: cloud \n\noccurrence information from CloudSat and CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared \n\n- 24 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\nPathfinder Satellite Observations), cloud-top-height data from MISR (Multiangle Imaging \n\nSpectroradiometer), temperature and humidity profiles from AIRS, and 3-hourly precipitation \n\ninformation from TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission). \n\nTable 3.2 gives basic information on the observational datasets used in this work, including, \n\ndataset name, horizontal and temporal resolution of the data products, and the parameters \n\nretrieved. \nObservational Datasets \n\nSource Dataset Reference Hor. res. ?t Parameter \n\nASDC CERES ES9 Wielicki et al.

Two basic ideas are behind these maps: 1) the fact that a single cross section may \n\nmiss relevant phenomena occurring in its vicinities (e.g., the diurnal cycle over the \n\nstratocumulus regions close to the coast of California may be modulated by subsidence caused \n\nby convection events over land, which can only be inferred from the analysis of the land \n\nportion of the 2D maps, since the GPCI transect is exclusively maritime); and 2) the need to \n\nanswer the question about the representativeness of the transect, in the sense of, to what degree \n\ncan any findings based solely on the analysis of data along the transect be extrapolated to the \n\n- 25 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\nbroader area of the (sub)tropical NE Pacific. This last point is addressed in the next paragraphs \n\nresorting to two different types of results. \n\nFirstly, ERA-40 winds are used to produce histograms of wind direction in a number of \n\ntransect locations to infer the degree of alignment of the GPCI section relative to the low level \n\ntrajectories of the atmospheric flow. More precisely, 1000 hPa and 900 hPa JJA 1998 winds \n\nwere analyzed at six different locations, as shown in Fig. 3.2. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Histograms of wind direction at 1000 hPa for six points along the GPCI transect from ERA-40 for \nJune-July-August (JJA) 1998. \n\nFigure 3.2 shows the wind direction histograms corresponding to the 1000 hPa level, for points \n\n2\u00b0N, 8\u00b0N, 14\u00b0N, 20\u00b0N, 26\u00b0N, and 32\u00b0N. For the sake of brevity, the corresponding results for \n\nthe 900 hPa level are not shown here. From these histograms it is apparent that, for most of its \n\nspan, the winds tend to be reasonably parallel to the transect (especially between 8\u00b0N and \n\n26\u00b0N, at 1000 hPa, and 14\u00b0N and 26\u00b0N, at 900 hPa). This comes in support of the, previously \n\nmentioned, argument that it is possible to study the main features associated with the cloud \n\nphenomenology in the GPCI region by resorting only to individual cross sections. Note, \n\nhowever, that, individually, the participating models may differ from ERA-40 in this regard, \n\nthough, as shown in the next chapter, all of them simulate the main features of the regional \n\n0\n\n45\n\n90\n\n135\n\n180\n\n225\n\n270\n\n315\n\n2 2 . 5\n\n6 7 .5\n\n1 1 2 .5\n\n1 5 7 .52 0 2 .5\n\n24 7 . 5\n\n2 9 2 .5\n\n33 7 . 5\n\n            JJA 1998\n       20\u00ba N @ 1000 hPa\n\n0 4 0 80 1 2 0 1 6 0 2 0 0\n# events\n\nE RA- 40\n\nGPCI section\n\nN\n\n0\n\n45\n\n90\n\n135\n\n180\n\n225\n\n270\n\n315\n\n22.5\n\n67.5\n\n112.5\n\n157.5202.5\n\n247.5\n\n292.5\n\n337.5\n\nJJA 1998\n       26\u00ba N @ 1000 hPa\n\n0 4 0 8 0 1 2 0 16 0 2 0 0\n# events\n\nERA- 40\n\nGP CI  sectio n\n\nN\n\n0\n\n45\n\n90\n\n135\n\n180\n\n225\n\n270\n\n315\n\n22.5\n\n67.5\n\n112.5\n\n157.5202.5\n\n247.5\n\n292.5\n\n337.5\n\n       JJA 1998\n       32\u00ba N @ 1000 hPa\n\n0 4 0 8 0 1 2 0 16 0 2 0 0\n# events\n\nERA- 40\n\nGP CI sect io n\n\nN\n\n0\n\n45\n\n90\n\n135\n\n180\n\n225\n\n270\n\n315\n\n22.5\n\n67.5\n\n112.\n\n157.5202.5\n\n247.5\n\n292.5\n\n337.5\n\n             JJA 1998\n        2\u00ba N  @ 1000 hPa\n\n5\n\n0 4 0 8 0 1 2 0 16 0 2 0 0\n# events\n\nERA- 40\n\nGPCI sectio n\n\nN\n\n0\n\n45\n\n90\n\n135\n\n180\n\n225\n\n270\n\n315\n\n22.5\n\n67.5\n\n112.5\n\n157.5202.5\n\n247.5\n\n292.5\n\n337.5\n\nJJA 1998\n        8\u00ba N @ 1000 hPa\n\n0 4 0 8 0 1 2 0 1 60 2 0 0\n# events\n\nE RA-40\n\nGP CI se ction\n\nN\n\n0\n\n45\n\n90\n\n135\n\n180\n\n225\n\n270\n\n315\n\n22.5\n\n67.5\n\n112.\n\n157.5202.5\n\n247.5\n\n292.5\n\n337.5\n\n       JJA 1998\n       14\u00ba N @ 1000 hPa\n\n5\n\n0 4 0 8 0 1 2 0 1 6 0 2 0 0\n# events\n\nN\nERA- 40\n\nG P CI  section\n\n- 26 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\nHadley circulation (as seen in the respective seasonal means along the cross section), thus \n\nsuggesting that the southeasterly advection of boundary layer air, is, in the models (as in ERA-\n\n40), fairly parallel to the GPCI cross section. \n\nThe second type of analysis resorts to information from the 2D maps to obtain histograms of \n\ncloud-related variables, such as total cloud cover (TCC) and precipitation, not only for the \n\ncross section locations but also for longitudinally adjacent points (5\u00b0 to the east and to the \n\nwest). Figure 3.3 shows, for the GFDL and the NCAR models, the precipitation histograms for \n\none GPCI point (5\u00b0N, 195\u00b0E), and two adjacent points, obtained for JJA 1998. Figure 3.4 \n\nshows TCC histograms for the same models and season (the GPCI point is now 20\u00b0N, 215\u00b0E). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Histograms of precipitation from the NCAR and GFDL models for one GPCI point (5\u00b0N, 195\u00b0E) and \ntwo adjacent (5\u00b0 to the east and west along the same latitude) points for June-July-August 1998. \n\nFor the two parameters shown, there is a clear similarity of the respective histograms between \n\nadjacent points for a given model, though quite different results can be found between the two \n\nmodels presented. This is still the case for other transect points and models (not shown).  \n\nOnce again, these results support the idea that the single-section approach used in GPCI may \n\nbe able to provide robust conclusions on main model physical processes, not only for the cross \n\nsection itself, but, as seen in Fig. 3.3 and Fig. 3.4, for the broader region of the (sub)tropics it \n\nrepresents. \n\n \n\n0.4 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n  precipitation (mm/day)\n\n5N 190E    \n\nNCAR    \n\n \n\n \n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n0.4 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n  precipitation (mm/day)\n\n5N 195E    \n\nNCAR    \n\n \n\n \n\n0.4 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n  precipitation (mm/day)\n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n5N 200E    \n\nNCAR    \n\n \n\n \n\n0.4 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n  precipitation (mm/day)\n\n5N 190E    \n\nGFDL    \n\n \n\n \n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n0.4 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n  precipitation (mm/day)\n\n5N 195E    \n\nGFDL    \n\n \n \n\n0.4 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n  precipitation (mm/day)\n\n5N 200E    \n\nGFDL    \n\n \n\n \n\n- 27 - \n\n\n\n-    The  GPCI project    - \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Histograms of total cloud cover from the NCAR and GFDL models for one GPCI point (20\u00b0N, \n215\u00b0E) and two adjacent (5\u00b0 to the east and west along the same latitude) points for June-July-August 1998. \n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n  total cloud cover (%)\n\n  20N 220E\n\n  NCAR\n\n \n\n \n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n  total cloud cover (%)\n\n  20N 220E\n\n  GFDL\n\n \n\n \n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n  total cloud cover (%)\n\n  20N 215E\n\n  GFDL\n\n \n\n \n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n  total cloud cover (%)\n\n  20N 215E\n\n  NCAR\n\n \n\n \n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n  total cloud cover (%)\n\n  20N 210E\n\n  NCAR\n\n \n\n \n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n  total cloud cover (%)\n\n  20N 210E\n\n  GFDL\n\n \n\n \n\n  r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\n- 28 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\n4 Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations \n\nThis chapter focuses on the first results obtained for GPCI and is intended to give an overview \n\nof the mean characteristics of the summertime atmospheric hydrologic cycle in the \n\n(sub)tropical NE Pacific as seen in model simulations and in observations, with an emphasis on \n\nthe vertical distribution of clouds, and on processes involving dynamical and environmental \n\nfactors that play a role in the maintenance of total and low cloud fields on a seasonal time \n\nscale. \n\nThe analysis presented here is in part based on the results published in Teixeira et al. (2011), a \n\nwork that benefited from substantial contributions from the author of this dissertation. \n\n4.1 Sea surface temperatures \n\nAs stated in the previous chapter, the basic request for the numerical simulations for GPCI was \n\nthe use of prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as a boundary condition for the climate \n\nruns, and, except for the coupled ocean-atmosphere version of the NCEP model, this was the \n\ncase for the participating models, though resorting to the use of slightly different SST analysis \n\ndatasets and implementation techniques. A quick look at the seasonal mean of the SSTs \n\nreported along the GPCI transect is presented below in Fig. 4.1 for June-July-August (JJA) \n\n1998 and 2003. \n BMRC\n CCC\n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Mean sea surface temperature (SST) along the GPCI transect for June-July-August (JJA) 1998 (left) \nand 2003 (right) from the participating models and ECMWF analysis. \n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n288\n\n290\n\n292\n\n294\n\n296\n\n298\n\n300\n\n302\n\n304\n \n\nS\nS\n\nT\n (\n\nK\n)\n\nlatitude\n\nJJA 1998\n\n ERA-40 June transect average\n ERA-40 July transect average\n ERA-40 Augut transect average\n ERA-40 JJA transect average\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n288\n\n290\n\n292\n\n294\n\n296\n\n298\n\n300\n\n302\n\n304\n\n \n\n \n\nlatitude\n\n CMC\n CSU BUGS\n CSU MMF\n DWD\n ECMWF\n ERA-40 (98)\n GFDL\n GKSS\n JAMSTEC\n JMA\n KNMI\n LMD\n M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France\n NCAR\n NCEP\n NCEP G&amp;M3\n UCLA\n UKMO\n UQM\n\nJJA 2003\n\n ECMWFan June transect average\n ECMWFan July transect average\n ECMWFan August transect average\n ECMWFan JJA transect average\n\n- 29 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nThree main features can be identified in both plots in Fig. 4.1, namely: i) a quasi-linear \n\nsouthward increase of SST along the trade winds, from about 290 K of the relatively cold \n\nwaters off the coast of California (35\u00b0N), to about 301 K, close to 10\u00b0N; ii) practically constant \n\nvalues in the area under the influence of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) (5\u00b0N to \n\n11\u00b0N); and iii) a slight decrease south of the ITCZ. There is, however, some dispersion among \n\nthe values from individual models, particularly notorious north of 17\u00b0N for JJA 2003. Going \n\nfrom 1998 to 2003, there is an overall increase of the SSTs along the transect, more \n\npronounced in its northern half, with an associated decrease in the mean latitudinal SST \n\ngradient. For illustration purposes, the monthly and seasonal mean \u201ctransect averages\u201d are \n\nshown for two analysis products from ECMWF (ERA-40 [1998] and ECMWFan [2003]). \n\nThese indicate that the increase in the seasonal \u201ctransect average\u201d from 1998 to 2003 is mostly \n\ndue to an accentuated monthly increase in the SSTs from June to July and August 2003 (note \n\nthat the value for June is lower in 2003 than in 1998). \n\nFinally, the SSTs obtained with the only coupled simulations available (NCEP GFS and \n\nMOM3 [NCEP G&amp;M3, in Fig. 4.1]) show very small differences between 1998 and 2003, \n\nexcept in the southernmost portion of the transect, where, even though increased in 2003, the \n\nSSTs are still below those from the other models, and are, interestingly, more similar to the \n\n1998 values from ERA-40. Regarding the relatively warm values obtained during JJA 1998 in \n\nthe subtropical regions, it can be argued that these may in part be associated with \n\nunderrepresentation of cloud cover probably linked to an important feedback between low \n\nclouds and the SST. \n\n4.2 Single-level parameters \n\nThis section is dedicated exclusively to JJA 1998 results. Figure 4.2 shows the seasonal mean \n\nvalues of a number of single-level cloud-related parameters. A brief description of these mean \n\nfields along the GPCI cross section is given here. A more detailed view can be found in \n\nTeixeira et al. (2011). \n\nThe analysis starts with total column water vapor (TWV) shown in Fig. 4.2a.

In SSM/I terms, \n\nthe TWV increases from around 18 kg m-2 in the northernmost part of the transect (35\u00b0N) to \n\nabout 50 kg m-2 at 8\u00b0N. Climatologically, these are  major changes in the atmospheric column \n\nand are related to the transition from a shallow boundary layer, capped by a dry upper \n\ntroposphere, to a regime characterized by fully developed moist convection events that reach \n\ndeeper as one approaches the ITCZ. The good agreement between SSM/I and ERA-40 for \n\nTWC is worthy of notice and, although somewhat expected, given the fact that ERA-40 \n\nassimilates related observational information, can be seen as indicative of good quality of the \n\nSSM/I data, while suggesting that ERA-40 reproduces well the component of the hydrological \n\ncycle responsible for this integral parameter. Unfortunately, this high degree of agreement is \n\nuncommon for the other variables analyzed, as will be seen later. The TWV average for the \n\nensemble of models is also very close to the observations and the reanalysis in all points of the \n\ntransect, with a relatively small (as compared to other variables) across-model standard \n\ndeviation. Note, however, that the model range reveal important departures from the \n\nobservational truth, of concern especially in the stratocumulus regions (north of 29\u00b0N) and in \n\nthe deep tropics (south of 11\u00b0N), where the range is O(20 kg m-2). To a great extent, the \n\nsituation in the stratocumulus is concomitant with the models\u2019 representation of the boundary \n\nlayer, and particularly with its vertical reach, a key feature of the cloudy boundary layer. This \n\nwill be discussed throughout the remainder of the chapter, and will receive a special focus in \n\nChapter 6. \n\nFigure 4.2b shows the seasonal mean total cloud cover (TCC) field along the GPCI transect for \n\nmodels, ERA-40, and ISCCP observations. Compared to the TWV results, TCC has an \n\naccentuated degree of scatter, as seen in the model range and standard deviation, confirming \n\nthe poor ability of current weather and climate prediction models to simulate clouds. Both \n\nERA-40 and the model ensemble average present important departures from the observations, \n\nin contrast with the results discussed above for TWV. More specifically, note in ERA-40 the \n\nnegative bias in the stratocumulus and initial transition to cumulus (23\u00b0N to 35\u00b0N), and the \n\npositive bias in the ITCZ. In turn, the ensemble average follows the ISCCP TCC relatively \n\nwell up to 20\u00b0N, but is even more negatively biased (-20 % to -30 % bias), as compared to the \n\nobservations, than ERA-40 north of that location. Contributing to this situation, is the \n\nexistence, among the available models, of extremely low values of seasonal mean TCC in the \n\nstratocumulus regime. Finally, it is important to bear in mind that the current ISCCP products \n\n- 32 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nhave uncertainties, particularly for tropical TCC, which is underestimated by about 10 % to 15 \n\n%, due to non detection of very thin cirrus (e.g., Stubenrauch et al. 1999). Nevertheless, at the \n\npresent, it is believed that the ISCCP cloud cover product is more reliable than ERA-40, a \n\nreanalysis obtained without assimilation of explicit cloud information (more recent ECMWF \n\nreanalysis efforts have shown improvement in the representation of maritime low clouds \n\n[K\u00f6hler 2005; Hannay et al. 2009] relative to ERA-40). \n\nIn relative terms, what is said above about the behaviour of ERA-40 and model ensemble \n\naverage TCC, as compared to ISCCP observations, is still valid for the liquid water path \n\n(LWP) parameter, shown in Fig. 4.2c with observations from SSM/I, namely: i) both ERA-40 \n\nand the ensemble average are below SSM/I in the stratocumulus regions; ii) ERA-40 \n\noverestimates LWP over the trade cumulus regions (unlike the ensemble average); iii) in the \n\ndeep tropics, ERA-40 clearly exceeds SSM/I (350 g m-2 versus 200 g m-2), where the ensemble \n\naverage stays close to the observations. Apart from the absolute peak value in the ITCZ, the \n\nrest of the cross section (to the north) is characterized by a relatively modest variation of \n\nSSM/I LWP, with a minimum value of about 55 g m-2 at 14\u00b0N, a maximum value of about 110 \n\ng m-2 at 26\u00b0N, and a value of about 80 g m-2 at 35\u00b0N. That said, it should be noted that \n\nmicrowave instruments such as SSM/I do have significant uncertainties (see Li et al. 2008, for \n\na comparison of LWP products from different satellite observations). The improvement of \n\nthese observational issues depends on how successful more recent instruments, such as those \n\nonboard CloudSat (e.g., Stephens et al. 2002), will be, in helping to clarify and reduce the \n\nuncertainties that affect LWP. \n\nFigure 4.2d presents seasonal mean precipitation with observations from GPCP. The first \n\nnoticeable feature is the key difference (common to all datasets analyzed) between the \n\nsubtropical regions, where (low) boundary layer clouds prevail, and the ITCZ, dominated by \n\ndeep convection. In particular, the subtropics receive very small amounts of precipitation, \n\nexcept in the case of (at least) one model with maximum values close to 2 mm day-1 in the \n\ntrade cumulus regions. In the ITCZ, GPCP amounts to around 9 mm day-1, slightly below the \n\nmodel ensemble average, and about half the value for ERA-40. Traditionally, it has been \n\ndifficult to obtain accurate observations of precipitation in relatively dry areas such as the \n\nsubtropics (e.g., Adler et al. 2003) and for this reason the error bars for the GPCP product in \n\nthese regions will be relatively large (e.g., Janowiak et al. 1998) and (percentwise) more \n\nimportant than in the ITCZ. \n\n- 33 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nIn Fig. 4.2e, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) results are shown, with observations from \n\nCERES. For the subtropical regions, the model ensemble average, and ERA-40, give OLR \n\nvalues that are, respectively, lower, and higher, than the observations. In the ITCZ-dominated \n\nregions, ERA-40 has a negative bias of about 20 W m-2 relative to CERES data, while the \n\nensemble average closely follows the observations. As expected, the underestimation of OLR \n\nin ERA-40 is consistent with ERA-40\u2019s positive biases of TCC, LWP, and precipitation in the \n\nITCZ. \n\nWith observations from CERES, Fig. 4.2f presents results for the net shortwave radiative flux \n\nat the top of the atmosphere (NSRTOA). It is clear that the reanalysis and the ensemble \n\naverage have similar values in the subtropical regions and all the way to 14\u00b0N, but, while in the \n\nstratocumulus areas (north of 23\u00b0N) both ERA-40 and the model average are above the \n\nobservations by up to 50 W m-2 (owing to the negative bias in cloud cover and cloud water), in \n\nthe shallow cumulus regions (between 14\u00b0N and 23\u00b0N), in turn, both underestimate NSRTOA. \n\nIn ERA-40 this is consistent with the described overestimation of LWP in the trades. A \n\npossible explanation for the corresponding bias of the ensemble average may come from the \n\nfact that trade wind cumuli have been found to be too reflective in climate model simulations \n\nas compared to observations (e.g., Potter and Cess 2004; Karlsson et al. 2008). Further south, \n\nin the ITCZ area, the ensemble average is closer to CERES than ERA-40, which shows a \n\nnegative NSRTOA bias of ~50 W m-2 (possibly in connection with the positive LWP and cloud \n\ncover bias found there). Finally, the high scatter among the models is, once again, problematic, \n\nand (more poignantly in the case of the shortwave radiation) points out to the need for greater \n\nmodel development efforts, especially thinking about the coupling between oceanic and \n\natmospheric model components, with the purpose of seasonal and climate prediction (recall the \n\ncase of the coupled model simulations in Fig. 4.1 [SSTs]). \n\n4.3 Profiles along the section \n\nIn this section the results from three additional variables are analyzed. The focus is on their \n\nsummertime seasonal distribution in the vertical along the GPCI cross section. Again, only a \n\nbrief description of the mean fields is given, and for just a subset of the participating models. \n\nFor a more comprehensive look, please refer to Teixeira et al.

Qualitatively, the basic features \n\nassociated with the regional Hadley circulation can be easily identified in all of the individual \n\nresults presented: with upward motion in the ITCZ, and a broad area of downward motion \n\ncharacterizing the subtropical free troposphere. A closer look, however, reveals several \n\nsubstantial differences between the models, namely: very shallow upward-motion layers in the \n\nITCZ (e.g., ETH/MPI); the width of the deep convection area (e.g., BMRC versus UKMO); \n\nand the strength of the deep convection (e.g. NCAR versus ERA-40). \nBMRC subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998 ECMWF subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998 ETH / MPI subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998\n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 - Vertical cross sections of subsidence along the GPCI transect for June-July-August (JJA) 1998 from \nmodels and ERA-40. \n\n-0\n.1\n\n5\n-0\n\n.1\n-0\n\n.0\n5\n\n-0\n.0\n\n2\n-0\n\n.0\n15\n\n00.\n01\n\n5\n0.\n\n02\n0.\n\n05\n0.\n\n1\n0.\n\n15\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\np\ne \n\n(h\nP\n\na)\nr\n\nes\nsu\n\nr\nGFDL subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998 JAMSTEC subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998 M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\np\n\ne \n(h\n\nP\na)\n\nr\nes\n\nsu\nr\n\nNCAR subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998 UKMO subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998 ERA-40 subsidence (Pa/s) JJA 1998\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\np\ne \n\n(h\nP\n\na)\nr\n\nes\nsu\n\nr\n\n- 35 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nLess pronounced, but still important, are also the differences in the subsidence field in the \n\nsubtropics, particularly for the free-troposphere above the trades (17\u00b0N to 23\u00b0N). \n\nFinally, note, how relatively low in the vertical profile, rather strong values of subsidence can \n\nbe felt in ERA-40 (and to some extent in UKMO) between 14\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N.

It should be kept in mind that, as a key player in the hydrologic \n\ncycle, relative humidity can be very informative of model deficiencies in its characterization. \n\nIn the case of the simulated boundary layer (as perceived from the relative humidity signature), \n\nthe most striking difference is in the way it grows from the stratocumulus to the shallow \n\ncumulus regions. In the ITCZ area, the differences pointed out above for the vertical velocity \n\nfield are now even more obvious, especially in what concerns the strength and width of the \n\ndeep convection. Another interesting feature is the minimum in relative humidity around 400 \n\nhPa in the ITCZ (the models do not agree on its absolute value). To conclude, recall that a \n\ndirect comparison between simulated and observed relative humidity is performed in Chapter \n\n6, resorting to satellite (AIRS) data. \n\nThe last variable chosen for analysis in this section is (cloud) liquid water content, shown in \n\nFig. 4.5 for models, ERA-40, and satellite observations from CloudSat (e.g., Stephens et al. \n\n2008). The CloudSat results correspond to the climatology for JJA for the period 2006 to 2010. \n\nKnown issues with this observing system, especially in getting information close to the ground \n\n(in the first km above the surface), and insufficient vertical resolution (~ 250-500 m), affect its \n\nreliability in what concerns the boundary layer liquid water content, and can explain a \n\nsomewhat flat stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition, as compared to most models (though \n\noverall showing a similar content of liquid water). Further south, in the deep tropical regions, \n\nthe variety of cloud liquid water vertical structures among the datasets shown is striking, with \n\nsome models (e.g., JAMSTEC) showing virtually no liquid water in the lower troposphere, \n\nwhile reporting its existence erroneously high in the  profile. Finally, it is apparent that UKMO \n\nis the model that most closely follows CloudSat\u2019s observations of liquid water content, \n\nespecially south of 26\u00b0N and up to 700 hPa in the ITCZ region, and thus, can be considered the \n\nmost accurate simulation among the different models. Bear in mind, however, that such a \n\nconclusion is somewhat superficial, given the fact that the CloudSat retrieval algorithm uses a \n\nfairly simple mixed-phase relation resorting to temperature information from ECMWF \n\nanalysis. \n\n- 37 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\n \nETH / MPI cloud liquid water (g/kg) JJA 1998ECMWF cloud liquid water (g/kg) JJA 1998\n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Vertical cross sections of liquid water (content) along the GPCI transect for June-July-August (JJA) \n1998 from models and ERA-40, and for JJA 2006-10 for CloudSat observations. \n\n4.4 Vertical distribution of clouds \n\nHaving analyzed the vertical distribution of subsidence, relative humidity, and liquid water \n\ncontent along the GPCI transect in the previous section, the attention will now be directed to \n\ncloud fraction, a key parameter of the phenomenology associated with the thermodynamics of \n\nthe hydrologic cycle.

Essentially, the lidar detects optically thin cloud layers, but cannot penetrate very deep \n\ninto (dense) cloud tops, while the radar is able to retrieve information from deeper in thick \n\nhydrometeor layers, but is limited by detection thresholds and contamination from surface \n\nclutter. These constraints are responsible for some of the features in the CloudSat and \n\nCALIPSO plots in Fig. 4.6, namely, less cloud occurrence in the ITCZ for CALIPSO, as \n\ncompared with CloudSat, and the \u201cclear\u201d surface layer in CloudSat. Note that CALIPSO\u2019s \n\nrelatively high cloud occurrence in the subtropics (north of 23\u00b0N along the transect) is \n\nsomewhat expected, and is an indication that stratocumulus decks form in the region in \n\nconditions unfavorable to the existence of upper-level optically-thick cloud layers. \n\nThere seemed to be enough reasons to envision the merging of information from CPR and \n\nCALIOP, especially in face of their virtually simultaneous measurements.

Moreover, the value of \n\nGPCI's relatively straightforward approach in trying to tackle these issues is well patent here, \n\nas it allows for the simultaneous evaluation of a number of important cloud and convection \n\nregimes. \n\nAmong the models shown, there is, in general, a qualitatively good representation of the \n\nevolution of the depth of the cloudy boundary layer going from the stratocumulus regions to \n\nthe deep tropics, with ECMWF, GFDL, and UKMO more realistically getting the expected \n\nsmooth and gradual deepening boundary layer (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2010). There are, however, \n\nsome noteworthy issues including: i) too low stratocumulus clouds (e.g., NCAR); ii) presence \n\nof distinct cloud layers in the transition areas (e.g., between 14\u00b0N and 23\u00b0N in BMRC); and iii) \n\nvery small cloud fraction (e.g., JAMSTEC). The differences in the ITCZ are significant, as \n\nwell, with some models showing substantial cloud fraction at all levels in the column (e.g., \n\nNCAR), in contrast with models with negligible amounts in the lower troposphere, but with \n\nlarge values in the upper troposphere (e.g., JAMSTEC); or models with large values in the \n\nlower troposphere, but with relatively low amounts in the upper troposphere (e.g., M\u00e9t\u00e9o-\n\nFrance). Finally, a quick comparison with the results in the right plot in Fig. 4.6, reveals \n\nNCAR as the most accurate simulation of the vertical distribution of cloud fraction, even more \n\nso than ERA-40. \n\n4.5 Process studies \n\nKeeping the focus on the climatological characterization of the hydrologic cycle, as inferred \n\nfrom cloud and cloud-related parameters associated with the different regimes found along the \n\nGPCI cross section, a process-oriented study is proposed here to investigate the interplay \n\nbetween dynamical and environmental variables which potentially impact cloud formation and \n\ncharacteristics in the GPCI region. The main goal is to describe the models\u2019 response to a \n\nvariety of large-scale and surface forcings. Given the fact that the analysis is based on a \n\nrelatively limited time period (JJA 1998 and 2003), the results presented here should be \n\nregarded as only preliminary. \n\nIn Section 4.5.1, the influence of the (prescribed) SSTs, on the large-scale atmospheric \n\ncirculation, and on a number of parameters, is investigated based on monthly means taken \n\nalong the GPCI section. In Section 4.5.2, the investigation goes a step further and looks at the \n\n- 41 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nrelation among subsidence, cloud cover, SST, and atmospheric stability obtained directly from \n\nthe available 3-hourly model and reanalysis data. \n\n4.5.1 Monthly means versus SST \n\nA relatively straightforward approach was taken to obtain, for the model simulations and \n\nECMWF analysis, the relations between SST and, vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700hPa), total \n\ncloud cover (TCC), liquid water path (LWP), precipitation (P), outgoing longwave radiation \n\n(OLR), and net shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (NSRTOA), shown in Fig. \n\n4.8. \n\n \n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35\n-0.16\n-0.12\n-0.08\n-0.04\n0.00\n0.04\n0.08\n0.12\n0.16\n\nw\n 7\n\n00\nhP\n\na \n(P\n\na/\ns)\n\nlatitude\n\n      COOL\n ECMWF\n M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nTC\nC\n\n (%\n)\n\nlatitude\n      COOL\n\n NCAR\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nLW\nP\n\n (g\n/m\n\n2 )\n\nlatitude\n\n      COOL\n NCEP\n ECMWFan\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\nP\n (m\n\nm\n/d\n\nay\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n     WARM\n ECMWF\n M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35\n215\n\n230\n\n245\n\n260\n\n275\n\n290\n\n305\n\n320\n\nO\nLR\n\n (W\n/m\n\n2 )\n\nlatitude\n\n      WARM\n NCAR\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35\n250\n275\n300\n325\n350\n375\n400\n425\n450\n\nN\nS\n\nR\nTO\n\nA\n (W\n\n/m\n2 )\n\nlatitude\n\n   \n   \n\nW\nA\n\nR\nM\n\n N\nC\n\nE\nP\n\n E\nC\n\nM\nW\n\nFa\nn\n\nFigure 4.8 - Vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700hPa), total cloud cover (TCC), liquid water path (LWP), \nprecipitation (P), outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and net shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere \n(NSRTOA) along GPCI from models and ECMWF analysis (ECMWFan) composited for the months with the \ncoolest (spatially averaged) monthly mean SST (COOL [squares]) and warmest (spatially averaged) monthly \n\nmean SST (WARM [stars]) among June, July, and August from 1998 and 2003. \n\nAt a first step, the coolest and warmest months, in terms of the transect-averaged SST, were \n\nidentified from the six months that comprise the two JJA seasons in 1998 and 2003 (the \n\navailable periods for GPCI). For the months thus identified, the corresponding monthly means \n\nfor the other parameters were then calculated at a second stage. In the results shown, the \n\ncoolest- and warmest-SST months have been found to be June 1998 and August 2003, \n\nrespectively (June 2003 and August 2003 in the case of the ECMWF analysis, for which only \n\n- 42 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\n2003 data were available). Essentially, all of the datasets have ~ 297 K for the coolest month, \n\nand ~ 299 K for the warmest month, which implies a ~ 2 K SST departure between the \u201ccool\u201d \n\nand \u201cwarm\u201d fields presented in Fig. 4.8. \n\nAs stated above, the main goal here is to analyze how, in a climatological sense, cloud-related \n\nparameters change in relation to changes in large-scale dynamical and environmental variables. \n\nIn this particular case, the investigation of changes between cool- and warm-SST months, \n\nbasically follows an approach widely used in climate sensitivity studies, that tries to \n\ncharacterize the simulated model response to specific perturbations imposed to the (prescribed) \n\nSST field. Spatially uniform perturbations of +2 K and -2 K are traditionally used (e.g., Cess et \n\nal. 1996; Bony et al. 2004), complemented by more complex spatially and time varying SST \n\nperturbations (e.g., Wyant et al. 2006). From what is said in Section 4.1, the SSTs prescribed in \n\nthe GPCI simulations correspond to analysis, and are thus quite realistic, in general showing, \n\nfor 2003, not just an overall increase, as compared with 1998, but also an accompanying \n\ndecrease in the along-transect gradient in the trades (Fig. 4.1). Recall, though, that there are \n\nslight dataset and implementation-technique differences among the different simulations used \n\nhere. In the ideal situation all models use the same SSTs, as is done in the traditional approach. \n\nThe fields of vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700hPa) produced for both \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cwarm\u201d \n\nmonths are, overall, qualitatively similar, and, as expected, depict the ascending and \n\ndescending branches of the Hadley circulation, with negative values of the pressure velocity in \n\nthe ITCZ (~ 5\u00b0N to 11\u00b0N) and positive values elsewhere, that peak in the subtropics (32\u00b0N to \n\n35\u00b0N). It is between 17\u00b0N and 29\u00b0N (mostly in the trades) that the different results agree the \n\nbest. In terms of the differences going from the \u201ccool\u201d to the \u201cwarm\u201d months, the results show: \n\na general intensification (except for the maximum values for NCAR and ECMWF, that have a \n\nslight decrease) and widening (especially towards the north) of the deep convection area \n\nassociated with the ITCZ; a decrease in subsidence at 17\u00b0N; in the trades, and all the way to \n\n32\u00b0N, the datasets do not agree in their response, showing both slight decreases or increases in \n\nsubsidence (except for NCEP, that shows a consistent decrease, and for ECMWFan, that shows \n\nan overall increase); at 35\u00b0N there is, in general, a marked increase in subsidence, the \n\nexceptions being ECMWFan, that basically doesn't change, and NCAR, that decreases. In fact, \n\ntwo mainly distinct behaviours can be found, on one side, NCAR simulates an overall weaker \n\nHadley circulation in the warm month, in clear contrast with ECMWFan, that intensifies the \n\nHadley circulation in response to the higher SSTs. In conclusion, there, is overall, a noticeable \n\n- 43 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nresponse of the large-scale circulation to the change(s) in the prescribed SSTs in all the models \n\n(and analysis) shown. \n\nRegarding the cloud cover response, the ITCZ shows a clear overall increase in TCC in all of \n\nthe datasets (except for NCEP). To some extent, this is expected, given the fact that the warmer \n\nSSTs have been found to favor an increase in the deep convective activity in this area. Note \n\nthat the decrease in the peak absolute value of w700hPa in the ITCZ (8\u00b0N) for NCAR is \n\nassociated with a relatively shy increase in TCC, as compared with the responses in the other \n\ndatasets. The response in the ITCZ is in contrast with the situation to the north of 17\u00b0N, where \n\nthe models show lower values for the warm-month TCCs versus the cold-month TCCs. Again, \n\nthis is to some extent expected in these regions, and a positive sign (from a climate modelling \n\nperspective) since warmer SSTs tend to be more favorable to shallow-cumulus clouds and less \n\nfavorable to the formation of extensive stratocumulus cloud decks (at 26\u00b0N and 29\u00b0N all \n\nresults agree in the TCC decrease). In this regard, and looking closer, a couple of results stand \n\nout in that they seem less intuitive, namely, the increases in TCC at 32\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N for NCAR, \n\nand at 35\u00b0N for ECMWFan. In NCAR this is even more striking, since, accompanying the \n\nincrease in SST, there is also a decrease in the intensity of the subtropical subsidence \n\n(w700hPa). Assuming that the TCC at 29\u00b0N and 32\u00b0N is essentially associated with low \n\nboundary layer cloudiness, and taking into account ECMWF and ECMWFan in that area, one \n\ncould argue that the fact that their (spatially-averaged) TCC decreases in the \u201cwarmer\u201d SST \n\nmonth, even in face of relatively important concomitant increases in the local \u201cwarm-month\u201d \n\nsubsidence, are an indication of a cloud response more directly connected to the change in the \n\nthermodynamic state of the lower troposphere (e.g., its static stability [typically negatively \n\ncorrelated with the SST]) than with the change in the large-scale dynamics (at least as \n\ntranslated by w700hPa). This is in line with some of the findings by Sandu et al. (2010). \n\nIn terms of the LWP variable, ECMWFan, M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance, and ECMWF, show a behaviour \n\nsimilar to that of their respective TCC parameter. The responses in TCC and LWP aren\u2019t as \n\nclear for NCAR, with at least five locations along the transect showing LWP and TCC with \n\nopposing responses. Overall, it seems as if the previously described weakening of the Hadley \n\ncirculation in NCAR entails lower values of simulated LWP in the GPCI region. There is, \n\nhowever, some interesting regional variation in NCAR's behaviour, especially in the distinct \n\ndecreases in LWP between -1\u00b0N and 11\u00b0N (ITCZ included), in clear contrast with the average \n\nincrease between 32\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N (well in the subtropical stratocumulus area) where, as stated \n\nabove, TCC also increases. Again, NCAR seems to respond with increased cloud formation \n\n- 44 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\n(TCC and LWP) in the stratocumulus area, even under large-scale dynamic and environmental \n\nconditions traditionally agreed as less favorable to extensive low boundary-layer cloudiness (as \n\ndiscussed in the previous paragraph). The available NCEP LWP had bad-data, and or units \n\nproblems and was not included in the plot. \n\nThe increase in precipitation (P) in response to warmer SSTs is noticeable, and, particularly for \n\nthe ITCZ, shows a clear dependence with the concomitant intensification (and widening) of the \n\ndeep convection region discussed above (for w700hPa). Quantitatively, the models show some \n\ninteresting nuances in the ITCZ, with ECMWF being clearly overactive in its precipitation \n\nresponse, as compared with its response in the other parameters discussed. This is in contrast \n\nwith the case of M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance, that shows a weaker intensification in precipitation, while being \n\nrelatively more responsive in the increases in TCC and LWP, and intensification of |w700hPa|. \n\nNote that NCAR actually shows a decrease in the peak precipitation intensity in the ITCZ, at \n\n8\u00b0N, while presenting at 11\u00b0N a significant increase in the precipitation rate in the warm month \n\n(~ 4 times higher) \u2013 a very clear response to the transition in the local dynamics regime, that \n\ngoes from downward motion (~ 0.02 Pas-1) in the \u201ccooler\u201d regime, to upward motion (~ -0.02 \n\nPas-1) in the \u201cwarmer\u201d regime. Finally, to the north of the ITCZ, there is an increase in \n\nprecipitation up to 20\u00b0N in all datasets, with basically unchanged precipitation rates to the \n\nnorth of 23\u00b0N, except for NCEP, that shows more precipitation at 26\u00b0N and 29\u00b0N, with the \n\nvalue at 26\u00b0N being almost as high as the values found in the deep convection area (e.g., at \n\n11\u00b0N), and, again, probably in association with a relatively important decrease in the intensity \n\nof the subsidence at 26\u00b0N (~ 0 Pas-1 in the monthly mean response for the warm SSTs). \n\nIn the ITCZ (and generally south of 17\u00b0N) most results show the expected link between OLR \n\nand variables such as TCC, LWP, and precipitation, that is, coherent simulated \n\nincreases/decreases in those three variables, are associated with decreases/increases in the \n\ncorresponding response of the OLR parameter to the warmer SSTs. This is, however, not the \n\ncase for NCEP, that shows relatively important increases in OLR between 8\u00b0N and 17\u00b0N, \n\nwhich is clearly more in line with the remarkable decrease in TCC, than with the increase in \n\nprecipitation in that area (recall that NCEP LWP data wasn't available). In the shallow cumulus \n\nand stratocumulus areas (north of 17\u00b0N), however, NCEP's OLR (overall decrease) appears to \n\nbe more sensitive to the precipitation changes (increase) than with the TCC changes (decrease) \n\nshown in response to the higher SSTs. The other datasets show the expected increase in OLR \n\nin response to the overall decrease in TCC (and LWP) to the north of 17\u00b0N (expect for \n\nECMWFan, that shows no apparent change in OLR between the warm and the cool months to \n\n- 45 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nthe north of 23\u00b0N, in line with the shy response in its LWP). Finally, looking at 32\u00b0N and \n\n35\u00b0N, NCAR's increase in OLR seems counterintuitive, given the increases in TCC and LWP, \n\nand raises a question about how high above the surface the associated cloudiness may have \n\nbeen simulated, since the lowest the cloudiness the lowest its expected impact on the OLR. The \n\navailable ECMWF OLR had bad-data, and or units problems and was not included in the plot. \n\nIn the remaining set of results, there is, overall, the expected link between NSRTOA, TCC, and \n\nLWP. This is especially true for LWP, whose local response (increases, or decreases) to the \n\nwarmer SSTs correlates well with the corresponding NSRTOA response (decreases, or \n\nincreases, respectively). One noteworthy departure from this close link is seen at 29\u00b0N, for \n\nboth NCAR and ECMWFan, that show decreases in NSRTOA, but also in both, TCC and \n\nLWP, in their simulated responses to +2 K SSTs. The available ECMWF NSRTOA had bad-\n\ndata, and or units problems and was not included in the plot. \n\nIn summary, one main finding of the analysis presented above, is the fact that the general \n\nresponse to the increase in SST is not always coherent among the different variables, \n\nparticularly at the local level at specific locations along the GPCI transect. This points out to \n\nthe need to better constrain the simulated behaviour of important cloud-related variables, \n\nincluding those crucial for the evaluation of the cloud radiative forcing. Any improvements in \n\nthis area would contribute to increase our understanding of the impacts and feedbacks of \n\nclouds in the hydrologic cycle, and ultimately of their key role in the climate system. Another \n\nimportant aspect of this study was the ability to, to some extent, qualitatively evaluate the \n\nrelative impact of the increase in SST as compared to that of the (concomitant) changes in the \n\nlarge-scale dynamics (w700hPa), in the response of the cloud variables to the (+2 K) SST \n\nperturbation. A more complete analysis of these dependencies is beyond the scope of this \n\nsection. Bony et al. 2004, and Wyant et al. 2006 offer further insight on this topic. Finally, it \n\nshould be added that, although the vertical velocity field (e.g., w700hPa) can be seen as a \n\nmeaningful proxy of the large-scale (sub)tropical circulation, and knowing its key role in the \n\nphenomenology of the difference tropical and subtropical cloud regimes, it is certainly not the \n\nonly important large-scale factor that can impact the behaviour of cloud variables, others \n\nbeing, for instance, mid-tropospheric dry intrusions, and temperature lapse rate modifications. \n\n4.5.2 Large-scale forcings \n\nIn this section the focus is more specifically on low cloud cover (LCC, obtained for each point \n\nin the GPCI transect simply from the maximum value of cloud fraction simulated in the layer \n\n- 46 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nbetween the surface and 680 hPa). The investigation tries to understand to what extent the \n\ninterplay between subsidence and SST, and alternatively, subsidence and low tropospheric \n\nstability (LTS, calculated at each location in the GPCI cross section taking the difference \n\nbetween the potential temperature at 700 hPa and the SST), relates to the model simulated low \n\ncloud cover in the segment of the GPCI transect between 14\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N (shallow cumulus \n\nand stratocumulus regions). The analysis is based solely on data for JJA 1998. Again, although \n\none single season and year cannot offer statistically significant conclusions, it is worthwhile to \n\nexplore the high temporal resolution (3-hourly) model output. \n\nFigure 4.9 is based on Fig. 16 in Teixeira et al. (2011), but shows, in addition to low cloud \n\ncover as a function of SST and subsidence, low cloud cover as a function of LTS and \n\nsubsidence, together with the joint probability density functions (jPDFs) for SST versus \n\nsubsidence, and LTS versus subsidence. At least as a first approximation, the left and right \n\nends of the SST axis in Fig. 4.9 can be seen as the northern and southern ends of the segment \n\nof the GPCI transect between the shallow cumulus and the stratocumulus, respectively (for the \n\nLTS it would be the other way around, although, most probably, to a lesser degree). \n\nThe jPDFs (in numbered contour lines) show, for all the results, the most representative bins in \n\nthe 0 to 0.05 Pas-1 subsidence range, confirming that the region between 14\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N is \n\ndominated by large-scale downward motion. For the binning used, the peak values in the \n\njPDFs seem more dispersed in the SST plots than in the LTS plots. Especially for the models \n\nshown (NCAR and UKMO), the largest values of subsidence are found in association with the \n\ncoldest SSTs. \n\nThe value of the mean LCC for each bin in the jPDFs of subsidence versus SST, and \n\nsubsidence versus LTS, is given by the color (%) scale. Although it is clear in all results that \n\nthe colder SSTs (below ~ 295 K) are associated with the highest LCCs  (above ~ 70 %), it \n\nseems difficult to find any obvious relation among the three parameters in any of the results \n\nshown. The NCAR results, show a more complex dependency of LCC on SST (and LTS), with \n\na decrease in LCC for the coldest (highest) waters (LTS). Note, as well, that the peak LCC in \n\nNCAR is found for negative subsidence values (though in relatively rare events). Particularly \n\nfor positive subsidence and in the vicinity of the most representative bins in the LTS plots (0 to \n\n0.05 Pas-1 [subsidence] and 15 K to 17 K [LTS] for NCAR and UKMO, and 0 to 0.05 Pas-1 and \n\n19 K to 21 K for ERA-40), these results do not show any specific dependency of LCC on the \n\nlarge-scale dynamics (vertical velocity at 700 hPa [mb]). \n\n- 47 - \n\n\n\n-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - \n\nMore comprehensive investigation on the interplay between cloud properties and measures of \n\nvertical stability has shown a significant relation between cloud cover and vertical stability in \n\nthe cloudy boundary layer (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Wood and Bretherton 2006). \n\nNCAR low cloud cover (%) JJA 1998 NCAR low cloud cover (%) JJA 1998\n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 - Mean low cloud cover for jointly binned classes of vertical velocity at 700 hPa (mb) and: sea surface \ntemperature (left column), and low tropospheric stability (right column) along the GPCI transect (14\u00b0N to 35\u00b0N) \n\nfor June-July-August (JJA) 1998 for two models and ERA-40.\n\n286 288 290 292 294 296 298 300 302\nsea surface temperature (K)\n\n-0.35\n-0.30\n-0.25\n-0.20\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n v\nel\n\noc\nity\n\n a\nt 7\n\n00\n m\n\nb \n(P\n\na/\ns)\n\n14 to 35 degrees\nN\n\north\n\n286 288 290 292 294 296 298 300 302\nsea surface temperature (K)\n\nUKMO low cloud cover (%) JJA 1998\n\n-0.35\n-0.30\n-0.25\n-0.20\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n v\nel\n\noc\nity\n\n a\nt 7\n\n00\n m\n\nb \n(P\n\na/\ns)\n\n14\nto\n\n35\ndegrees\n\nN\north\n\n0102030405060708090\n\n286 288 290 292 294 296 298 300 302\nsea surface temperature (K)\n\nERA-40 low cloud cover (%) JJA 1998\n\n-0.35\n-0.30\n-0.25\n-0.20\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n v\nel\n\noc\nity\n\n a\nt 7\n\n00\n m\n\nb \n(P\n\na/\ns)\n\n14\nto\n\n35\ndegrees\n\nN\north\n\n-0.35\n-0.30\n-0.25\n-0.20\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n v\nel\n\noc\nity\n\n a\nt 7\n\n00\n m\n\nb \n(P\n\na/\ns)\n\n14 to 35 degrees N\north\n\n7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33\nlow tropospheric stability (K)\n\nUKMO low cloud cover (%) JJA 1998\n\n-0.35\n-0.30\n-0.25\n-0.20\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n v\nel\n\noc\nity\n\n a\nt 7\n\n00\n m\n\nb \n(P\n\na/\ns)\n\n14 to 35 degrees N\north\n\n7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33\nlow tropospheric stability (K)\n\nERA-40 low cloud cover (%) JJA 1998\n\n-0.35\n-0.30\n-0.25\n-0.20\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n v\nel\n\noc\nity\n\n a\nt 7\n\n00\n m\n\nb \n(P\n\na/\ns)\n\n14 to 35 degrees N\north\n\n7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33\nlow tropospheric stability (K)\n\n- 48 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\n5 Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition \n\nFollowing a more traditional look at seasonal means of cloud-related parameters, presented in \n\nChapter 4 to characterize the mean thermodynamic structure in weather and climate prediction \n\nmodels, the study will now turn to a more detailed analysis of the recurring transition in \n\nconvective regime associated with the Hadley circulation, a prominent feature of the eastern \n\nboundaries of the (sub)tropical oceans (e.g., Sandu et al. 2010), discussed above specifically \n\nfor the GPCI region. \n\nThe different cloud regimes associated with the large-scale overturning circulation (e.g., \n\nboundary layer clouds, deep convection towers, and the transitions between them) exert an \n\nimportant impact on the (sub)tropical atmospheric circulation, and thus on the climate system \n\nas a whole (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; Ma et al. 1996; Larson et al. 1999). One important \n\naspect of these cloud systems is the relative contrast of their cloud radiative forcing (CRF) \n\n(e.g., Ramanathan et al. 1989; Hartmann et al. 1992) and feedbacks (e.g., Larson et al. 1999; \n\nLindzen et al. 2001), two factors that make their relative spatiotemporal partitioning an \n\nimportant subject in climate change investigation. Climate change sensitivity experiments (e.g., \n\ndoubling CO2), show striking differences in the climate models' response in (low) boundary \n\nlayer clouds, in many cases resulting in diverging cloud-climate feedbacks (e.g., Bony et al. \n\n2004, Bony et al. 2006; Bony and Dufresne 2005; Wyant et al. 2006; Stephens 2005). In \n\nparticular, it has been shown that the low-level cloudiness found in regions of moderate \n\nsubsidence (e.g., trade-wind ShCu [shallow cumulus]) strongly influence modelled responses \n\nof CRF to prescribed ocean surface warming, mostly owing to their ubiquitous nature, and, \n\nhence, higher statistical weight (e.g., Bony et al. 2004). In this context, it can easily be argued \n\nthat any changes in the (sub)tropical transitions between Sc (stratocumulus) and ShCu would \n\nhave an impact on the tropical radiation budget, and therefore should be an important part of \n\nthe investigation of cloud\u2013climate feedbacks. \n\nIn the following sections, cloud data from model simulations, atmospheric reanalysis, and \n\nsatellite observations are used in the GPCI framework to gain insight into the question of the \n\ntransition in (sub)tropical cloud regimes. This is done by describing the observations, and \n\nevaluating and intercomparing the different models in view of their specific cloud and \n\nboundary-layer parameterizations. Several techniques to detect the transitions, and or \n\nsummarize their main seasonal features, are proposed in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, after the \n\n- 49 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\npresentation of results from a preliminary spectral analysis of the seasonal record of spatial \n\nshifts in the location of sharp transitions in total cloud cover (TCC), a novel approach to \n\nclustering of spatial patterns is introduced, and subsequently applied to TCC along the GPCI \n\ntransect, with the final goal to indentify main spatiotemporal features of the seasonal tropical \n\nand subtropical TCC, and compare their respective environmental conditions. \n\nThe analysis presented in Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3, is, in part, based on the results \n\npublished in Teixeira et al. (2011). Section 5.1.4 discusses results published in Karlsson et al. \n\n(2010). The two publications were co-authored by the author of this thesis. \n\n5.1 Representation of cloud transition \n\nThe brief sequence of results presented below is intended to characterize the spatiotemporal \n\nnature of the subtropical Sc-to-ShCu transitions, and how their presence and behaviour can be \n\ndetected, or inferred, in different ways, depending on which aspect of its phenomenology one \n\nfocuses on. Several approaches are then used to reveal different expressions of this transition, \n\nas seen in models and observations: from its impact on traditional seasonal climatologies of \n\ncloud cover (Section 5.1.1); to how it affects the summertime distribution of cloud cover \n\nvalues in different locations (Section 5.1.2); and how abrupt these transitions may actually be, \n\nas seen in high temporal resolution data (Section 5.1.3); or, more specifically looking at low \n\nboundary layer clouds, how their mean cloud-top height evolves along the GPCI transect \n\n(Section 5.1.4). \n\n5.1.1 Seasonal mean cloud cover \n\nAs a starting point of the analysis of the cloud regime transitions, done in the next sections \n\nresorting to TCC information, Fig. 5.1 shows the individual model mean TCC behind the \n\nstatistics presented in Fig. 4.2b (namely, model ensemble mean, ensemble mean plus and \n\nminus one standard deviation, and maximum and minimum values [range] at each location \n\nalong the GPCI section). \n\nThe choice of TCC for this investigation, is partly based on the fact that the analysis is \n\nperformed along the whole length of the GPCI transect, therefore encompassing the different \n\ncloud regimes (Sc to the north, ShCu in the transition areas, and deep convection towers in the \n\ninter-tropical convergence zone [ITCZ] ). A corresponding study, using low cloud cover (LCC) \n\ninstead, is not included here, owing to the lack of LCC output in the GPCI protocol (a simple \n\n- 50 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\ndefinition of LCC was used for the results presented in Fig. 4.9, knowing, though, that it may \n\nnot be exactly the one in use in the different models). Note that, by looking at the features in \n\nthe TCC field alone, one cannot directly infer on the nature of the associated convection \n\nregimes; it is only from the knowledge gained in the preceding chapters, that a close link \n\nbetween TCC and convection regimes can be reported. In this regard recall, for instance, the \n\nseasonal means of the vertical distribution of cloud fraction along GPCI presented in Fig. 4.7. \n\nNote that these results indicated that in the northern portion of the cross section, the TCC \n\nreported is probably very often mostly coming from the low cloudiness  simulated  during the \n\nJune-July-August (JJA) 1998 season. \n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nJJA 1998\n \n\nto\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n BMRC             KNMI\n CCC   M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France\n CMC              NCAR\n CSU BUGS    NCEP\n CSU MMF       UCLA\n DWD   NCEP G&amp;M3\n ECMWF         UKMO\n ETH / MPI        UQM\n GFDL               LMD\n GISS                 JMA\n GKSS          ERA-40\n JAMSTEC     ISCCP\n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - June-July-August (JJA) 1998 mean total cloud cover along GPCI from each one of the participating \nmodels, ERA-40 reanalysis, and ISCCP observations. \n\nIt was stressed in Teixeira et al. (2011) that the large degree of scatter among the models\u2019 mean \n\nTCC is a clear indication of the serious problems current weather and climate prediction \n\nmodels have simulating clouds. Going a step further in that discussion, the question is now on \n\nwhether the way in which the transitions between the different cloud regimes happen in the \n\nmodels contributes to the perceived model (and reanalysis) deficiencies. Can it (at least partly) \n\nexplain the differences in TCC between NCAR and ERA-40 in the 17\u00b0N to 35\u00b0N portion of the \n\ntransect (where NCAR is consistently above ERA-40)? How do the cloud transitions in M\u00e9t\u00e9o-\n\nFrance and UKMO compare to the ones in ISCCP between 20\u00b0N and 32\u00b0N (where the three \n\ndatasets show relatively small TCC departures)? \n\n5.1.2 Histograms \n\nAlthough an important tool for a quick evaluation of first-order differences among \n\ncorresponding results from different model simulations, seasonal mean diagnostics (e.g., the \n\n- 51 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nTCC mean in Fig. 5.1), fall short of providing higher-order information such as temporal \n\nvariability, which, usually, is valuable in further sorting out the relative performance of the \n\nmodels. In this section, TCC is analyzed from the perspective of its probability density \n\nfunction (PDF), taken individually at each location along the GPCI transect with the goal to \n\nfurther explain the nature of the cloud regime transition in the region, namely: 1) how is it \n\nbeing reproduced in the models; and 2) what do observations (e.g., ISCCP) show in this \n\nrespect. \n\nIn Fig. 5.2, PDFs of TCC along the GPCI transect, obtained from 3-hourly data from JJA 1998, \n\nare presented, for models, reanalysis, and ISCCP observations.  \n\nECMWF cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998 ETH / MPI cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998 GFDL cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998\n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - June-July-August (JJA) 1998 histograms of total cloud cover along the GPCI transect for some of the \nmodels, ERA-40, and ISCCP. \n\n05152535455565758595\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\nJAMSTEC cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998 M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998 NCAR cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\nUKMO cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998 ERA-40 cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998 ISCCP cloud occurrence (%) JJA 1998\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntotal cloud cover (%)\n\n-1\n2\n5\n8\n\n11\n14\n17\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n35\n\nla\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n- 52 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nThe clear differences among these results, once again, confirm the variety of model behaviours \n\nin what concerns the simulation of clouds. Note that important differences in the TCC \n\ndistributions can be found even in locations where models do show practically the same mean \n\nTCC (e.g., ECMWF, GFDL, and UKMO at 20\u00b0N [typical location for Sc-to-ShCu transitions] \n\nwhere all show ~ 60 % TCC). In more detail, and looking separately at each one of the three \n\nmain cloud regime domains along the GPCI cross section, the situation is, for the Sc domain \n\n(26\u00b0N to 35\u00b0N): i) ISCCP, NCAR, and UKMO do not have any counts in the lowest TCC bins \n\n(TCC &lt;30 %); ii) GFDL and JAMSTEC preferably fall in the extreme TCC bins (TCC &lt;10 % \n\nand TCC > 95 %); while iii) ECMWF, ETH/MPI, ERA-40, and M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France fall somewhere \n\nin between those two situations. In the ShCu domain (14\u00b0N to 26\u00b0N): i) ECMWF, JAMSTEC, \n\nM\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, NCAR, ERA-40, and ISCCP show relatively smooth transitions, covering the \n\nbins between ~ 20 % and 90 % TCC; ii) overall, the TCC distributions are wider in ISCCP, \n\nERA-40, ECMWF, and M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, and relatively narrower for JAMSTEC, and \n\n(particularly) NCAR; iii) in contrast, the transitions in UKMO, ETH/MPI, and (particularly) \n\nGFDL are quite abrupt. Finally, in the ITCZ domain (5\u00b0N to 11\u00b0N): i) often high values of \n\nTCC (> 70 %) characterize the distributions for GFDL, NCAR, and M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France; ii) \n\nECMWF, ETH/MPI, ERA-40, and ISCCP also show an important peak in the highest TCC \n\nbins, but have a wider spread in the overall distribution; iii) on the other hand, UKMO has a \n\npreference for lower TCC bins (TCC &lt;50 %), and shows a considerable spread in the deep \n\nconvection TCC values; iv) JAMSTEC stands out as having its TCC distributed mostly \n\nbetween 20 % and 40 % TCC. In summary, two very distinct Sc-to-ShCu transitions can be \n\nidentified in these TCC results, namely, a relatively smooth southward evolution (e.g., NCAR) \n\nand a more abrupt one with a bimodal character (e.g., UKMO). \n\nAssuming that the main reason behind the differences in the TCC transition among the model \n\nresults is mostly related to the way clouds are parameterized, a quick review of two distinct \n\ncloud parameterizations used in two of the models shown seems appropriate. In the case of the \n\nNCAR model, it could be argued that, to its smooth transition in the TCC evolution in the \n\nsubtropics contributes the fact that its subtropical boundary layer cloudiness is, partly, \n\nparameterized in tight connection with the lower tropospheric stability (LTS, defined as the \n\ndifference between the potential temperatures at 700 hPa and at the surface) \u2013 an empirical \n\nrelation (e.g., Slingo 1980; Klein and Hartmann 1993) that has been adapted and used in \n\nclimate modelling (e.g., Slingo 1987; Rasch and Kristj\u00e1nsson 1998), but that, apparently, \n\nperforms better at describing this link between low clouds and LTS, on larger spatiotemporal \n\n- 53 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nscales (e.g., Kawai and Teixeira 2010). Recall that the results shown above, were obtained \n\nfrom the 3-hourly (and grid box) model output. That said, it is probable that NCAR is partly \n\nadjusting to the LTSs found along the GPCI transect (decreasing southward with increasing \n\nSSTs) by diagnosing corresponding climatological values of cloud cover, which then \n\npotentially leads to the smooth transition in TCC (the tight adjustment of [low] cloud cover to \n\nLTS may also be a reason for the relatively narrow seasonal TCC PDF distributions described \n\nabove in the transition domain). It should be noted, however, that this parameterization may \n\nnot always have the final word on the boundary layer cloud determination, and that, because \n\nTCC reported by models generally results from the application of cloud overlap assumptions of \n\nsome sort, to the vertically distributed cloud fraction (including the boundary layer \n\ncontributions), the overall impact of this parameterization on the final values of TCC cannot be \n\nfully understood from the available model output. \n\nIn the case of the UKMO model, the cloudy boundary layer parameterization is known to have \n\nbeen developed with the idea of the existence of a finite number of spatially separated \n\nsubtropical physical regimes, such as those associated with stratocumulus, cumulus, and the \n\ntransitions from cumulus to stratocumulus (e.g., Lock et al. 2000). This kind of simplification \n\nmay be responsible for the bimodal nature of the TCC distribution along GPCI in the UKMO \n\nand (partly) in the GFDL results. \n\nGoing back to what ISCCP shows, although a final evaluation of the models in terms of these \n\nboundary layer cloud transitions would have to come from the study of a larger geographical \n\narea, and a longer time period, the preliminary conclusion is that none of these two very \n\ndifferent model behaviours and parameterization approaches reproduces well the observed \n\npattern in TCC distribution along the GPCI cross section for the JJA 1998 season. \n\n5.1.3 Sharp gradients \n\nThe results presented in the two preceding sections showed well that the evolution of cloud \n\ncover along the GPCI transect is subject to changes that have a signature, not only in the mean \n\nvalues, but also in the nature of the local distributions of total cloud cover (TCC) \u2013 both shown \n\nto be quite different among the various datasets. Although undeniably useful for the study of \n\nthe transitions in cloud regime, these two views of the TCC field are static by definition, and \n\nthus, cannot provide information on how the cloud cover values (coherently) change in time \n\nalong the cross section during the season. Here, the investigation is taken to a new level \n\nresorting to the available high temporal resolution model output and observational data, so as \n\n- 54 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nto produce estimates of how often the transitions are characterized by more or less abrupt \n\ndiscontinuities in the TCC field (known to be a manifestation of the subtropical maritime Sc-\n\nto-ShCu transitions). \n\nThe methodology proposed for the new kind of averaging can be divided into two main steps: \n\n(i) starting at the northernmost point (35\u00b0N, in the Sc region) and progressing southward along \n\nthe cross section, determination of the location of the first significant decrease in TCC (e.g., \n\nabove a given threshold of 30 % TCC); (ii) calculation of the average TCC to the northeast \n\n(NE) and southwest (SW) of the location determined in (i). This is performed for each one of \n\nthe TCC records available 3-hourly. Note that, in step (ii), it is assumed that the TCC field is \n\nclose to spatially uniform in the transect domains to the north and to the south of the transition \n\nlocation. Finally, the values for the seasonal mean TCC of the abrupt transition are obtained for \n\nthe extreme north and south locations in the transect, respectively, from the means of all the \n\nNE and SW TCC averages; and for the mean location of the transition, as the mean of all the \n\nlocations found in the 3-hourly data. Histograms of the transition location are computed as \n\nwell. Bear in mind that, because the TCC field may actually not be uniform, the averaging of \n\nthe TCC over the NE and SW domains mentioned above [step (ii)] can potentially result in a \n\nTCC difference between these domains lower than the threshold used to identify the abrupt \n\ndecrease in TCC (this may even result in a SW TCC average higher than the one to the NE). \n\nAn updated version of this methodology, developed to overcome this issue, is presented later in \n\nsection 6.3.3.1. \n\nFigure 5.3 presents, for ERA-40 and ISCCP, a summary of the main features associated with \n\nthe occurrence of abrupt decreases in TCC along the GPCI transect, obtained by applying the \n\nmethodology described in the previous paragraph to data for JJA 1998. Both ERA-40 and \n\nISCCP show an important jump in TCC (left plot). These results show that this approach was \n\nable to capture discontinuities in the TCC field, whose magnitude and prevalence can, in part, \n\nbe responsible for the TCC features that are typically seen in the more traditional seasonal \n\nmeans of TCC along the GPCI transect (note the high seasonal occurrence [occ] in both ERA-\n\n40 and ISCCP, shown in the plot to the right [location histograms]). It should be said that these \n\nresults were practically unchanged using different values for the TCC threshold (e.g., 20% or \n\n30% TCC), an indication of the robustness of the methodology. Recall, however, that the TCC \n\nvalues reported by the models may not (always) correspond to (low) boundary layer cloud \n\ncover (typically the cloudiness more directly subject to this kind of transitions), but can also (or \n\nexclusively) include information on high- and mid-level cloud cover. \n\n- 55 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nImportant departures between ERA-40 and ISCCP are highlighted in the context of this kind of \n\nanalysis. In the left plot in Fig. 5.3, the two datasets differ, not only in the mean strength of the \n\nTCC gradients (~ 15 % and ~ 40 %, respectively for ERA-40 and ISCCP), but also in the mean \n\nTCC to the NE and SW of the abrupt decreases in TCC (ISCCP is ~ 10 % above ERA-40 to \n\nthe NE, and ~ 15 % lower to the SW), and in the mean location of the gradients (~ 20\u00b0N in \n\nISCCP and ~ 26\u00b0N in ERA-40). In what concerns the histograms of the location of the sharp \n\ngradients (right plot), it can be seen that the transition from Sc to ShCu occurs, in ERA-40, \n\nmuch more to the north (with the peak at 35\u00b0N, the northernmost point in the transect) than in \n\nISCCP (with the peak at 23\u00b0N). In a lagrangian perspective this would mean that the break-up \n\nof the Sc decks into ShCu happens too early in ERA-40, as compared to ISCCP, and could be \n\nan additional reason for the negative cloud bias (ERA-40 vs. ISCCP) found in the subtropics \u2013 \n\napart from the overall lower TCC values in the Sc areas shown in Fig. 5.2, and described in the \n\nprevious chapter (Fig. 4.2b). \n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 - June-July-August (JJA) 1998 ISCCP and ERA-40 cloud cover statistics obtained from a methodology \nbased on the identification of large gradients of total cloud cover (tcc drop > 30 %) along the GPCI transect (see \ntext for details): (left) seasonal mean values, and (right) histograms of the locations of the abrupt changes in total \n\ncloud cover (occ stands for occurrence [in percent]). \n\nIn Fig. 5.4, the results presented for (some of) the participating models show a diversity of \n\nbehaviours in the sharp TCC transitions in all of the main features under investigation. \n\nGenerally speaking: 1) the mean TCC decrease, as shown in these plots, is found to be between \n\n~ 45 %, in the UKMO simulations, and ~ 15 % for M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (for ISCCP it is ~ 40 % [Fig. \n\n5.3]); 2) the seasonal frequency of occurrence (occ, in the plots) is between 86.7 %, for NCAR, \n\nand ~ 100 % in the other models; 3) the variability in the TCC values to the NE and SW of the \n\nmean gradient locations is large, and patent in the contrast between BMRC and ECMWF (the \n\nNE TCC in BMRC is about the same as the SW TCC in ECMWF [~ 55 % TCC]); and 4) the \n\ndifferent histograms show one, two, or even three relatively well defined peaks. \n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n100\nJJA 1998\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\n \n\nto\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n ERA-40\n ISCCP\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n\nJJA 1998\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nnu\nm\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n e\n\nve\nnt\n\ns\nlatitude\n\nocc ~ 97.1 %  ERA-40\nocc ~ 90.6 %  ISCCP\n\n- 56 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 - Similar to Fig. 5.3, but for some of the GPCI models. \n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n100\n \n\nBMRC\n\nto\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n\nocc ~ 100 %\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nJJA 1998\n\n n\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n e\n\nve\nnt\n\ns\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n\n to\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n \n\nECMWF\n\nlatitude\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\nocc ~ 99.2 %\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nJJA 1998\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n100\n\n n\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n e\n\nve\nnt\n\ns\n\nto\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n \n\nETH / MPI\n\nlatitude\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\nocc ~ 99.9 %\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nJJA 1998\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n\n \n\nGFDL\n\nlatitude\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\n to\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nocc ~ 99.2 %\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nJJA 1998\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n100\n\n n\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n e\n\nve\nnt\n\ns\n\nto\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n \n\nJAMSTEC\n\nlatitude\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n\nocc ~ 98.9 %\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nJJA 1998\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n to\n\nta\nl c\n\nlo\nud\n\n c\nov\n\ner\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n \n\nMeteoFrance\n\nlatitude\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\nocc ~ 96.9 %\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nJJA 1998\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n100\n \n\nNCAR\n\nto\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n\nocc ~ 86.7 %\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nJJA 1998\n\n n\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n e\n\nve\nnt\n\ns\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\n\n to\nta\n\nl c\nlo\n\nud\n c\n\nov\ner\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n \n\nUKMO\n\nlatitude\n\n0\n30\n60\n90\n\n120\n150\n180\n210\n240\n270\n300\n\nocc ~ 99.3 %\n\ntcc drop > 30 %\n\nJJA 1998\n\n- 57 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nIn more detail, it is worth noting that the overall good agreement between the location \n\nhistograms for GFDL (Fig. 5.4), and ISCCP (Fig. 5.3), especially in what concerns the location \n\nof the main peak (23\u00b0N), happens in concomitance with two substantially different histograms \n\nof TCC along the transect (Fig. 5.2). To some degree, this is also the situation for ECMWF and \n\nETH/MPI (with similar location histograms with one central peak between 26\u00b0N and 29\u00b0N, but \n\ndifferent TCC histograms). The NCAR model clearly stands out from all the other models in \n\nthe sense that the main peaks in its location histogram are found in the ITCZ area, at 5\u00b0N and \n\n8\u00b0N, where the vast majority of sharp-gradient events happen. This is more easily understood \n\nin connection with the result shown in Fig. 5.2 (histograms of TCC along the transect), where \n\nit is apparent that the NCAR TCC only very gradually decreases from the Sc, in the northern \n\nportion of the transect, to the ShCu, and all the way to 14\u00b0N (recall NCAR\u2019s narrow TCC \n\nPDFs along the trades), from where it increases towards the ITCZ. This leaves the occurrence \n\nof abrupt decreases in TCC mostly to the area south of the deep convection region. Note that \n\nusing LCC would probably eliminate the high peaks in the location histograms to the south of \n\nthe ITCZ, and would probably (further) lower the absolute number of these events along the \n\ncross section. Again, this is partly a consequence of the way subtropical boundary layer clouds \n\nare parameterized in the NCAR model (see the discussion in Section 5.1.2). \n\nThe complementariness of the different techniques proposed for the investigation of cloud \n\nregime transitions along the GPCI transect is well patent \u2013 none of them can independently \n\nfully describe these transitions. In the next section, yet another perspective on the cloud \n\ntransitions is presented, with the focus more specifically on changes in the low-cloud fields. \n\n5.1.4 Cloud-top height \n\nAs qualitatively discussed in previous sections (e.g., Sections 4.2 to 4.4), the evolution of the \n\ncloud regimes along the GPCI cross section happens in association with a deepening of the \n\nmaritime boundary layer from the Sc, to the north of the transect, to the ShCu, in the trades, \n\nand all the way to the vicinity of the deep convection area (ITCZ). Here a more quantitative \n\nanalysis of the evolution of the boundary layer is presented. It relies on the assumption that the \n\nlow clouds in the region are mostly confined to the boundary layer (particularly in the Sc \n\nregimes), and resorts to cloud top height (CTH) information to produce a climatological \n\nestimate of boundary layer depth, for observations and models along the GPCI transect. The \n\nCTH climatology constitutes an important model evaluation tool, that can provide insight on \n\n- 58 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nhow well the models treat the processes responsible for the maintenance of the cloudy \n\nboundary layer. \n\nThe results presented below are based on the findings reported in Karlsson et al. (2010), a \n\npaper co-authored by the author of this thesis. \n\nOn the observational side, the study is based on the level-2 wind-corrected CTH product \n\nobtained from the retrievals by the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on the Terra \n\nsatellite (Moroney et al. 2002; Davies et al. 2007). Terra is on a sun-synchronous polar-orbit \n\nand crosses the Equator at ~ 1030 local solar time (descending node). Operationally, MISR \n\nuses nine cameras at different angles to detect CTH reflectivity, that is then used in stereo-\n\nmatching algorithms (Muller et al. 2002), and subsequently subject to geometrical adjustments \n\nto infer cloud motion and CTH (Zong et al. 2002). The CTH product used offers a horizontal \n\nresolution of 1 \u00d7 1 km2, and a nominal accuracy of 6560 m (6300 for low-level clouds [Naud et \n\nal. 2004; Garay et al. 2008]). MISR CTHs have been reported to be accurate in the Sc and \n\nShCu areas (Garay et al. 2008; Genkova et al. 2007). For this study, CTHs below 3000 m were \n\naccrued during JJA 2003, for each one of the 13 locations along the GPCI section (in 3\u00b0 x 4\u00b0 \n\nlatitude, longitude domains). The spatial average of the CTHs for each domain was then \n\nconverted to cloud-top pressure using geopotential and temperature data from atmospheric \n\nreanalysis. \n\nFor the model simulations (and ECMWF analysis) the low clouds\u2019 cloud-top pressure was \n\nobtained for each location in the cross section from the vertically distributed cloud fraction for \n\nthe model levels > 700 hPa (below ~3000 m), provided that no clouds were reported above 700 \n\nhPa, and assuming the low clouds to be arranged in maximum overlap. Clouds with cloud \n\ncondensate below 0.01 g kg-1 were disregarded, assuming that they would not be detected by \n\nthe satellite instrument (other values for this threshold were tried). The final low-clouds\u2019 cloud-\n\ntop pressure was then obtained from the weighted average of the half pressures above the \n\nmodel levels with (detectable) cloud fraction (the respective cloud tops are assumed to be \n\nlocated above the actual level where the cloud fraction is reported by the model), weighted by \n\nthe respective amount of cloud fraction that would be seen from above in the case of a \n\nmaximum cloud overlap. \n\nIn Fig. 5.5, the JJA 2003 CTH results along the GPCI transect are summarized for the models, \n\nECMWF analysis, and MISR. In terms of the seasonal means (in plots a and b), there is an \n\noverall good agreement between the ECMWF analysis and the model ensemble. Basically, \n\nboth show an increase in CTH along the entire transect from a value of ~ 950 hPa at 35\u00b0N to ~ \n\n- 59 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\n875 hPa at 28\u00b0N, and a maximum of ~ 825 hPa at 5\u00b0N. MISR also shows an increase in CTH \n\nbetween 35\u00b0N (~ 925 hPa) and 20\u00b0N (~ 825 hPa), but has lower mean CTH to the south of \n\n20\u00b0N, and gets closer to the simulated CTH between 17\u00b0N and 11\u00b0N (~ 875 hPa at 11\u00b0N), \n\nstaying below the models, and analysis, in the deep convection area and south of it. MISR's \n\nmuch higher spatial resolution permits the detection of relatively fine spatial detail in the cloud \n\nscenes. It is thus speculated that the decreased CTH, south of 20\u00b0N (transition to the trades and \n\nITCZ), is probably related with the detection of small cumuli that stay below the subsidence \n\ninversion (e.g., Genkova et al. 2007; Zhao and Di Girolamo 2007), a situation that may be \n\nassociated with the decoupling between the (ocean) surface and the top of the maritime \n\nboundary layer, by an intermediate weakly-stable layer. Figure 5.5c shows only relatively \n\nsmall departures in CTH variability between MISR and the models (MISR's CTH variability is \n\nabove [below] that from the models, and analysis, to the north [south] of 23\u00b0N [20\u00b0N]). The \n\nsharp decrease in MISR's variability, going from 23\u00b0N to 20\u00b0N, possibly indicates the area \n\nwhere the trasition from Sc to ShCu is more frequent (recall that ISCCP has at 23\u00b0N the \n\nmaximum peak in its histogram of the location of abrupt decreases in total cloud cover [Fig. \n\n5.3, for JJA 1998]). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 - Boundary layer height estimate based on the pressure at the top of low clouds, obtained along the \nGPCI transect for June-July-August 2003, for models, ECMWF analysis [dashed line], and MISR observations \n\n[solid black line]. The solid dark-gray line represents the median of the model ensemble, the light-gray envelope \nrepresents the interquartile model range, and the dark-gray envelope represents the range of model values: (a) \n\nmean values, (b) mean values for the models individually [gray lines], and (c) temporal variability (one standard \ndeviation). (Figure taken from Karlsson et al. 2010). \n\n- 60 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nKarlsson et al. (2010) show, in addition to CTH, results from an alternative technique to \n\ndetermine the top of the maritime boundary layer (BLT) and estimate its depth, \u201cbased on the \n\nheight of the maximum vertical RH [relative humidity] gradient with respect to pressure.\u201d It \n\nwas applied to humidity data from models, analysis, and satellite observations. Although \n\nequally promising for BLT investigation, a discussion of that technique, and corresponding \n\nresults, is left to Section 6.3.1 (Relative humidity as a proxy for boundary layer depth), and \n\nSection 6.3.2 (A new scheme to determine the BLT), where an updated version of the \n\nmethodology is introduced. \n\n5.2 Refined analysis \n\nTo close the chapter, results from a more in-depth investigation of some of the aspects of the \n\ncloud regime transitions discussed above, are presented in the next couple of sections. Firstly, \n\nin Section 5.2.1 (Modes of temporal variability) the study tries to refine the characterization of \n\nabrupt changes in TCC done in Section 5.1.3 (Sharp gradients), and performs a spectral \n\nanalysis of the corresponding 3-hourly record, with the goal to understand the dynamics of the \n\nTCC transition in terms of the variability of its location. This is presented to complement the \n\nstatic view offered by the location histograms (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). Section 5.2.1 ends with \n\nproposals for future work, and suggestions on how to extend the analysis to other key \n\nparameters. Finally, Section 5.2.2 (Environmental conditions associated with main seasonal \n\nTCC fields) tries to go beyond the all-encompassing seasonal mean view of the TCC field \n\npresented in Section 5.1.1 (Seasonal mean cloud cover), and resorts to high temporal resolution \n\n(3-hourly) TCC data for the identification of spatiotemporal patterns corresponding to \n\npreferred modes of behaviour of the cloud regime transitions that occur along the GPCI cross \n\nsection. This is done using a newly developed clustering technique, whose TCC results are \n\nthen used to composite other cloud-related variables, to infer potential impacts of their \n\ninterplay on the regime transitions that occur in the region. \n\n5.2.1 Modes of temporal variability \n\nThe first step to prepare the data for the spectral analysis of the spatial variability of the sharp \n\ngradients in TCC (see Section 5.1.3 for details on how to detect these abrupt changes in TCC \n\nalong the GPCI transect) was the subtraction, from the corresponding 3-hourly record, of the \n\nvalue of their seasonal mean location (all given in latitude along the cross section). The result \n\nis a record of location anomalies that allows for a relatively straightforward intercomparison \n\n- 61 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\namong different datasets. Figure 5.6 shows, for JJA 1998, the seasonal anomaly record for a \n\nfew of the models, ERA-40 reanalysis, and ISCCP observations, and offers a quick view of the \n\ndynamics of the TCC transition in terms of the shifts in its location in complement of the \n\ninformation in the respective location histograms (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). Note that in the abscissa \n\naxis (time) the minor ticks correspond to days (8 UTCs, 3-hourly), and the labels (located at \n\nthe beginning of each week during the season) indicate the number of 3-hourly records up to \n\nthat point in time. Also, keep in mind that a positive (negative) latitudinal displacement \n\nindicates a position along the transect to the north (south) of the seasonal mean location. \n\nThere are some noteworthy differences among the datasets shown in Fig. 5.6. For instance: in \n\nISCCP, the latitudinal displacements are, overall, relatively large (between +16\u00b0 and -16\u00b0), and \n\nthe sharp decreases in TCC tend to stay for longer periods to the north of the mean location, a \n\nsituation that changes dramatically in the last two weeks of August, when these consistently \n\ntend to stay to the south of the mean location; ERA-40 shows, overall, a highly changeable \n\nlocation of the sharp gradients, with displacements confined between +8\u00b0 and -24\u00b0; in the \n\nsecond half of the season there is, in the reanalysis, a tendency of the sharp gradients to stay for \n\nlonger periods in a given location (either to the north or to the south of the mean location); for \n\nNCAR, the displacements oscillate between -8\u00b0 and +20\u00b0, and show a noticeable change in the \n\nlast 4 weeks of the season, with the sharp gradients preferably staying to the north of the \n\nseasonal mean location (especially in the last week of August), probably a result of earlier (in a \n\nlagrangian sense) Sc-to-ShCu transitions, owing to the warming SSTs (lower LTS) \n\nexperienced in the northern part of the transect towards the end of the JJA 1998 season (see the \n\ndiscussions in Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3); ETH/MPI shows the smallest latitudinal \n\ndisplacements (basically between +8\u00b0 and -8\u00b0), and is the dataset whose sharp gradients \n\nhappen continuously for longer periods in any of the sides of the mean location (e.g., a positive \n\ndisplacement for the whole fifth week of JJA); finally, in UKMO, the main feature seems to be \n\nthe increase in the variability of the location of the sharp gradients towards the end of the \n\nseason. \n\n- 62 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 - June-July-August (JJA) 1998 time series of the location (relative to the seasonal mean position) of \nsharp gradients in total cloud cover (see text for details) for ISCCP observations, ERA-40 reanalysis, and some of \nthe GPCI models (in the abscissa axis, minor ticks correspond to days, and labels, located at the beginning of each \n\nweek during the season, indicate number of 3-hourly records up to that time). \n\n1 57 113 169 225 281 337 393 449 505 561 617 673 729\n-24\n-20\n-16\n-12\n-8\n-4\n0\n4\n8\n\n12\n16\n20\n24\n\nJJA 1998\n\n \n\nla\ntit\n\nud\nin\n\nal\n d\n\nis\npl\n\nac\nem\n\nen\nt\n\nISCCP\n\n1 57 113 169 225 281 337 393 449 505 561 617 673 729\n-24\n-20\n-16\n-12\n-8\n-4\n0\n4\n8\n\n12\n16\n20\n24\n\nJJA 1998\n\n \n\n \n\nla\ntit\n\nud\nin\n\nal\n d\n\nis\npl\n\nac\nem\n\nen\nt\n\nERA-40\n\n1 57 113 169 225 281 337 393 449 505 561 617 673 729\n-24\n-20\n-16\n-12\n-8\n-4\n0\n4\n8\n\n12\n16\n20\n24\n\nJJA 1998\n\n \n\n \n\nla\ntit\n\nud\nin\n\nal\n d\n\nis\npl\n\nac\nem\n\nen\nt\n\nNCAR\n\n1 57 113 169 225 281 337 393 449 505 561 617 673 729\n-24\n-20\n-16\n-12\n-8\n-4\n0\n4\n8\n\n12\n16\n20\n24\n\nJJA 1998\n\n \n\n \n\nla\ntit\n\nud\nin\n\nal\n d\n\nis\npl\n\nac\nem\n\nen\nt\n\nETH / MPI\n\n1 57 113 169 225 281 337 393 449 505 561 617 673 729\n-24\n-20\n-16\n-12\n-8\n-4\n0\n4\n8\n\n12\n16\n20\n24\n\nJJA 1998\n\n \n\n \n\nla\ntit\n\nud\nin\n\nal\n d\n\nis\npl\n\nac\nem\n\nen\nt\n\ntime (3-hourly)\n\nUKMO\n\n- 63 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\nFigure 5.7 presents the power spectra corresponding to the temporal series shown in Fig. 5.6, \n\nand, additionally, the power spectrum for M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (whose temporal series is not shown in \n\nFig. 5.6). It is apparent that there are no outstanding peaks in any of the plots. Nevertheless, \n\nrelatively speaking, they show, overall, the expected behaviour when compared against the \n\nrespective anomaly records analyzed above, e.g., ISCCP is generally slower (higher power in \n\nthe lower frequencies) than UKMO or ERA-40, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France is similar to ISCCP, and \n\nETH/MPI has more power in the lowest frequencies than UKMO. In more detail, there is a \n\nrelatively well define power peak in UKMO around a period of 12.5 days (10-2 in the \n\nfrequency axis), while, for ERA-40, the most prominent peak is located around 6.25 days. \n\nIt would be interesting to extend this analysis to other cloud-related parameters of interest for \n\nthe topic of the subtropical cloud regime transitions. Taking advantage of the 3-hourly model \n\nand reanalysis data, variables such as LTS, SST, and free tropospheric humidity could be \n\nspatially averaged in a domain upwind of the mean location of the sharp gradients in TCC (or \n\nLCC), and the record of their anomaly relative to the respective seasonal means be subject to \n\nthe same kind of treatment proposed above (Figs. 5.6 and 5.7). Relevant questions could then \n\nbe asked, for instance, about the correlations between each one of those anomaly records and \n\nthe anomaly of the location of the sharp gradients of TCC (or LCC); or, how do their spectra \n\ncompare. Finally, it seems imperative to perform this kind of investigation also for results \n\nobtained using more refined definitions of the sharp gradients in cloud cover, e.g., the one \n\npresented later in Section 6.3.3.1, more robust, and potentially able to provide better guidance \n\nfor the compositing of the other key parameters. \n\n- 64 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 - Frequency spectra of the June-July-August 1998 time series presented in Fig. 5.6 for ISCCP \nobservations, ERA-40 reanalysis, and some of the GPCI models (M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France is not shown in Fig. 5.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n10-3 10-2 10-1 100\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n\nISCCP\n\n \n\npo\nw\n\ner\n\nfrequency (cycles per 3 hours)\n10-3 10-2 10-1 100\n\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n\nERA-40\n\n \n\npo\nw\n\ner\n\nfrequency (cycles per 3 hours)\n\n original  original\n smoothed  smoothed\n\n10-3 10-2 10-1 100\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n\nNCAR\n \n\n \n\npo\nw\n\ner\n\nfrequency (cycles per 3 hours)\n10-3 10-2 10-1 100\n\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n\nETH / MPI\n\n \n\n \n\npo\nw\n\ner\n\nfrequency (cycles per 3 hours)\n\n original  original\n smoothed  smoothed\n\n10-3 10-2 10-1 100\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n\nUKMO\n\n \n\n \n\npo\nw\n\ner\n\nfrequency (cycles per 3 hours)\n\n10-3 10-2 10-1 100\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n\nM\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance\n\n \n\n \n\npo\nw\n\ner\n\nfrequency (cycles per 3 hours)\n\n original  original\n smoothed  smoothed\n\n- 65 - \n\n\n\n-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - \n\n5.2.2 Environmental conditions associated with main seasonal TCC fields \n\nThe goal here is to describe the environmental conditions associated with distinct features of \n\nthe cloud regimes (and respective cloud transitions) that occur during the JJA season in the \n\ntropical and subtropical NE Pacific ocean. A first step would have to do with the search for \n\npreferred spatiotemporal modes in the behaviour of the TCC field along the GPCI cross \n\nsection. It was suggested that such investigation on the behaviour of the TCC field could be \n\nperformed resorting to a clustering methodology. The decision to follow this kind of approach \n\nled to the development of GEPAT (Grade-based Empirical Pattern Analysis Technique), a \n\nnovel cluster analysis technique introduced in Appendix A.4 to this thesis. Preliminary GEPAT \n\nresults seem adequate for the accomplishment of that goal. It is in this context that ERA-40-\n\nversus-ISCCP GEPAT results for TCC are used for the compositing of key dynamical and \n\nthermodynamical variables believed to have an important role in the maintenance and \n\nevolution of the cloud phenomenology in the GPCI region.

For that \n\nend, state-of-the-art satellite observations are analyzed along the GPCI cross section, together \n\nwith model simulations and atmospheric analyses. A number of results, based on the treatment \n\nof relative humidity data for the summer season, are presented, namely, seasonal mean \n\nprofiles, variance, temporal evolution, boundary-layer properties, and potential impact on \n\ncloudiness structure and transition. \n\n6.1 Validation of simulations of relative humidity \n\nIn this section, the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) is introduced. This advanced remote \n\nsensing instrument constitutes an important source of satellite data for numerical weather \n\nprediction and for climate research, specifically for its strengths in providing, with \n\nunprecedented detail and on a daily basis, global profiles of temperature and humidity. The \n\nfocus is on the use of June-July-August (JJA) 2003 relative humidity information to validate \n\nmodel simulations. The section ends with a discussion of some of the challenges of bringing \n\ntogether models and observations, in an integrated and meaningful way, in the particular \n\ncontext of the GPCI transect. \n\n6.1.1 The Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder \n\nUntil recently, most large-scale water vapor climatological studies have depended primarily on \n\nanalyses of radiosonde data. Radiosondes have good resolution in the lower troposphere in \n\npopulated regions, but are notoriously unreliable, and are usually unsuitable for detecting \n\ntrends of water vapor in the upper troposphere. Also, these traditional measurement systems \n\nlack over remote oceanic regions. More recently, substantial progress has been made using \n\nsatellite observations to obtain total column water vapor, and (low-resolution) vertical profiles \n\nof humidity, from infrared and microwave sensors. One disadvantage of satellite observations \n\ncomes from their inability to provide water vapor data for certain weather and cloud \n\nconditions, or above a number of surface types. \n\n- 68 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nAIRS \n\nAIRS (Aumann et al. 2003) is a state-of-the-art advanced infrared sounding system launched \n\non May 4, 2002, on the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Earth \n\nObserving System (EOS) Program\u2019s Aqua platform, into a nominal altitude of 705 km in a \n\ncircular sun-synchronous near-polar orbit with equatorial crossings at 0130 local time, on the \n\ndescending (southward moving) orbit, and 1330 local time, on the ascending (northward \n\nmoving) orbit. Its period is 98.8 min, and orbital correction maneuvers maintain the orbit with \n\na repeat cycle of 16 days. Together with other instruments on Aqua (e.g., AMSU [Advanced \n\nMicrowave Sounding Unit]), AIRS forms an integrated cross-track nadir-scanning sounding \n\nsystem. This instrument suite combines infrared and microwave retrievals, a feature designed \n\nto allow for a significant reduction of the limiting effects of cloud contamination in the field of \n\nview of infrared sounders. The infrared spectrometer/radiometer covers the 3.7 ?m to 15.4 ?m \n\nspectral range with 2378 spectral channels. With the basic goal of supporting NASA\u2019s interest \n\nin process study and climate research, AIRS is, additionally, the first hyperspectral IR \n\n(InfraRed) radiometer designed to support NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n\nAdministration) / NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) requirements for \n\noperational numerical weather forecasting. At launch, AIRS had an expected seven-year \n\nlifetime. The sounding goals of AIRS were to produce 1 km tropospheric-layer mean \n\ntemperatures with a root-mean-squared (RMS) error of 1 K, and layer precipitable water with a \n\nRMS error of 20 %, in cases with up to 80 % effective cloud cover (also called effective \n\nfractional cloud cover, or infrared cloud fraction, given by the product of the fraction of the \n\nfield of view [FOV] covered by clouds and the cloud emissivity at 11 ?m). It is the ability of \n\nthe AIRS sounder to work in combination with the microwave sounder that enables the \n\nfulfillment of the \u201c1 K/1 km\u201d requirement for temperature, and 15 %/2 km humidity vertical \n\nresolution, globally, and under clear and cloudy conditions. In comparison to existing \n\nobservations, AIRS brings high vertical resolution combined with global daily coverage. \n\nOf the 2378 spectral channels of the AIRS instrument, 1524 are used to derive regression \n\ncoefficients, and considerably fewer channels are used in the AIRS physical retrieval steps. \n\nAIRS retrieval algorithms deconvolve spectrally adjacent lines whose weighting function \n\npeaks are spaced closely in the vertical. Ultimately, the retrievals from the instrument suite are \n\nmade available as data in the form of calibrated spectral radiances, radiance estimates from \n\nforward models of radiative transfer, and geophysical state estimated through retrieval \n\nalgorithms. Those data are made available through the GSFC (Goddard Space Flight Center) \n\n- 69 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nDAAC (Distributed Active Archive Center), mapped onto regular grids, referenced as \u201cLevel \n\n1B\u201d (calibrated radiances), \u201cLevel 2\u201d (spot by spot retrievals with nominal 45 km resolution \n\nfrom the AMSU FOV), and \u201cLevel 3\u201d (global gridded) data. The L3 data are given on a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 \n\nlatitude-longitude grid, and can be downloaded as 1-day, 8-day, or monthly mean segments \n\n(the ascending and descending orbits are gridded separately). \n\nAIRS has been providing: ? atmospheric temperature profiles; ? specific humidity profiles; ? \n\ntotal precipitable water vapor; ? fractional cloud cover; ? cloud-top pressure and temperature; \n\n? total ozone burden of the atmosphere; ? column abundances of minor atmospheric gases \n\n(e.g., CO2, CH4, CO, and N2O); among other products. Of particular importance is the  \n\nrecognized ability of AIRS to measure water vapor in the upper troposphere between 300 hPa \n\nand 100 hPa. \n\nValidation efforts \n\nA number of relevant publications (e.g., Fetzer et al. 2003) have documented the comparison \n\nof AIRS retrieved products with collocated/contemporaneous independent data, to infer \n\nobservational errors and establish the accuracy of those products. Radiosondes are the main \n\nsource of such observational data. In general, the results validate the AIRS retrievals of \n\ntemperature and humidity to within the design specifications. \n\nTobin et al. (2006) used high-quality dedicated radiosondes, launched for AIRS validation at \n\nthe Atmospheric Radiation Monitoring (ARM) Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) site at Nauru \n\n(166.9\u00b0E, 0.5\u00b0S), and another ARM site in Oklahoma, and concluded that, at Nauru, biases \n\nbetween AIRS and radiosonde water vapor were in the range -4 % to 6 % in 2 km layers in the \n\nlower troposphere (with total precipitable water vapor biases of less than 5 %, surpassing the \n\ntheoretical limit of 5 % [Aumann et al. 2003]). They showed that the biases had only a weak \n\ndependence on cloud amount. Divakarla et al. (2006) compared AIRS full retrievals against \n\nglobally available operational radiosondes (including both land and water cases) and reported \n\nbiases of less than about 10 % in 2 km layers. They also found potential temperature biases of \n\n~ 0.5 K, at 600 hPa, and ~ -0.5 K, at 300 hPa (temporal variations in CO2 absorption may have \n\ncontributed to slight biases in the retrievals). McMillin et al. (2007) use GPS data to rescale \n\nradiosonde profiles, and find overall agreement between the AIRS and radiosonde integrated \n\nprecipitable water (IPW) vapor observations, indicative of the good performance of AIRS as a \n\nwater vapor sounder (consistent with the results published by Tobin et al. [2006] and Divakarla \n\net al. [2006] mentioned above). Focusing on the upper troposphere, Gettelman et al. (2004) \n\ncompared AIRS profiles collocated to in situ aircraft data in the upper tropospheric / low \n\n- 70 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nstratospheric region. They found a good match between temperatures in the two data sets, \n\nshowing no bias, and a standard deviation of 1.5 K. For water vapor below 150 hPa the \n\nstandard deviation was around 20 %, without big departures, and, in the same way, relative \n\nhumidity at 250 hPa (and below) was also unbiased, with a standard deviation of 9 %. Fetzer et \n\nal. (2003), using data from Vaisala operational radiosondes over water, shows AIRS full \n\nretrievals of water vapor with biases of -4 % to 4 %, in 2 km layers, between the surface and \n\n500 hPa. Comparing AIRS with European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast \n\n(ECMWF) reanalyses in the Eastern Pacific, and operational radiosondes in Southern \n\nCalifornia and Hawaii, Fetzer et al. (2004) showed biases of -5 % to 3 % for full retrievals in \n\nthe surface-to-700 hPa layer. Fetzer et al. (2006), comparing matched AMSR-E (Advanced \n\nMicrowave Scanning Radiometer for EOS) and AIRS independently-derived total precipitable \n\nwater vapor (PWV) for two 16-day periods, showed RMS differences of about 0.2 kg/m2 (a \n\nbetter agreement than the global mean difference seen by Amenu and Kumar [2005] between \n\nNVAP [NASA Water Vapor Project] and a model reanalysis). Again, they notice weak \n\ndependence of biases on inferred AIRS cloud amount, indicating that the AIRS cloud clearing \n\nmethodology (Susskind et al. 2003) does not introduce significant cloud-dependent biases. On \n\na regional scale, the work points out to the fact that the largest AIRS wet observational biases \n\nwere located in regions more affected by persistent stratus cloud cover, and that trade wind \n\ncumulus regions had observational biases between AIRS and AMSR-E near zero (it is also in \n\nthe trades that AIRS full-retrieval yields peak to values as high as 90 %). \n\nOf special relevance for this work, is the generic conclusion that several comparisons of AIRS \n\nover-ocean full retrievals of water vapor against radiosondes, consistently indicate mean biases \n\nof only a few percent, usually irrespective to cloud amount up to 70 % to 80 % (AIRS effective \n\nfractional cloud cover). We note that previous examination of absolute differences in humidity, \n\nshows better agreement between AIRS and radiosondes over sea than over land, in line with \n\nthe expectation that the AIRS retrievals should be more accurate over water (the higher surface \n\nreflectivities enhance the sensitivity of the microwave channels to changes in moisture). \n\nFinally, regarding the global AIRS retrievals, it has been concluded that, at least for humidity, \n\ntemperature, and related products, the primary source of sampling biases is clouds affecting \n\nAIRS infrared signal. From the results of the retrieval algorithms\u2019 calculations it is apparent \n\nthat the percent of accepted geophysical parameters does decrease with increasing cloud \n\nfraction, in a manner that depends on the geophysical parameter. It can therefore be inferred \n\nthat the fraction of AIRS full retrievals yields will vary with season and location. \n\n- 71 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nThe identification of these biases can be done recurring to (global) comparisons between AIRS \n\nand, other satellite data sets, model reanalyses, or even GCM (General Circulation Model) \n\nsimulations (preferably with an ensemble of different models). In this perspective, this work \n\ncan be, in part, seen as yet another such effort, in which AIRS observational data are subject to \n\ncomparison with model simulations in addressing regional-scale climate processes of \n\nimportance to global climate (change) studies. \n\n6.1.2 AIRS relative humidity along GPCI \n\nFor this study, AIRS-version-4 humidity and temperature data were processed following \n\nGettelman et al. (2006) to obtain a dataset of relative humidity (RH) throughout the \n\ntroposphere in the (sub)tropical NE Pacific Ocean. The resulting RH dataset, with daily \n\ntemporal resolution for JJA 2003, is analyzed and compared to weather and climate prediction \n\nmodel simulations in the GPCI framework. \n\nMore precisely, the first step for the calculation of RH profiles, was to gather available \n\nstandard Level 2 (L2) profiles for which the infrared retrieval had been successfully completed. \n\nThis is important, since, only the successful convergence of the algorithms during the final IR \n\nretrieval for the bottom-most part of the profile, can ensure full retrievals with the specified \n\nsystem accuracy of 1 K in 1 km layers (15 % in 2 km layers) over the entire temperature \n\n(humidity) profile (complete convergence occurs utilizing the full complement of microwave \n\nand infrared radiances from AMSU and AIRS, respectively). As mentioned, full retrievals \n\noccur more frequently under less cloudy conditions, and none are obtained for effective \n\nfractional cloud cover greater than about 80%. These water vapor (q) and temperature \n\nretrievals were then used to derive RH for each profile (RH = q/qs \u00d7 100, in percent, where qs \n\nis the saturation water vapor mixing ratio). The calculations of RH were further restricted to \n\nregions where water vapor is greater than 10 ppmv, the nominal reported instrument \n\nsensitivity. The formulation of Goff and Gratch (1946) over water, for temperatures > 273 K (0 \n\n\u00b0C), and over ice, for temperatures &lt;253 K (-20 \u00b0C), was used to calculate qs. A linear \n\ncombination was used between 253 K and 273 K. Other alternative formulations exist, but the \n\nfact that this is identical to what is used in (some) GCMs, may facilitate comparisons. Given \n\nthe fact that the AIRS retrievals provide a column water vapor ( q ) between two pressure \n\nlevels, and temperature on the corresponding (sub)layer edges, the RH profiles were calculated \n\nusing a corresponding column saturation vapor pressure ( sq ) obtained from numerical \n\nintegration of the saturation vapor pressure profile in the sublayer, assuming linear temperature \n\n- 72 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nchange between its two adjacent edges. Detailed sensitivity tests were conducted and the \n\nresults are not highly sensitive to the method chosen (Gettelman et al. 2006). \n\nFinally, the profiles of RH (at the AMSU nominal ~ 45 km spatial resolution) were binned into \n\na 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 latitude\u2013longitude grid, with longitude bins held constant at 111 km. Also, the \n\nascending and the descending orbits of Aqua were commingled in a single daily record. The \n\ndataset comes in 20 pressure levels between 1000 hPa and 5 hPa (1000, 925, 850, 700, 600, \n\n500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 20, 15, 10, 7, and 5 hPa), but here only the \n\ninformation from the levels 70 hPa and below is used (it is believed that AIRS sensitivity to \n\nwater vapor drops rapidly around 100 hPa). Bear in mind that, following the AIRS convention, \n\nthese pressures refer to the bottom of the sublayers. \n\nAs discussed above, the limiting effects of the presence of clouds in the AIRS FOV, implies a \n\nreduction of the number of full retrievals with increasing cloud amount. In this work it is \n\nassumed that, for the model simulations, the value corresponding to the 80 % AIRS effective \n\nfractional cloud cover threshold is of the order of 70 % total cloud cover (TCC). The \n\nconsequences of this constrain in the sampling characteristics of AIRS data, and the way it \n\naffects/defines the methodology of model validation and intercomparison, is discussed in the \n\nnext section (6.1.3 Matching models and observations). \n\nFigure 6.1 presents three samples of RH extracted for the GPCI cross section from the daily \n\nAIRS RH record. These are compared with GOES10 (Geostationary Operational \n\nEnvironmental Satellite 10) imagery in the infrared (channel 4, wavelength 10.7 ?m). The \n\nthree different days were chosen as representing three distinct synoptic meteorological \n\nsituations typically found during JJA 2003 in the (sub) tropical NE Pacific. A straight black \n\nline is superimposed on the GOES images to schematically locate the GPCI transect. Taking \n\ninto account that the AIRS data corresponds to an entire 24 hour period of measurements, it \n\nwas desired to find GOES images showing persistent meteorological features, as captured in \n\nthe 00 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) and 12 UTC snapshots, corresponding to those \n\nsame days in terms of the local time in the study area. The GOES images shown were all taken \n\nat 12 UTC, which, in local solar time, corresponds to approximately 03:40 am (~ 00:30 am) at \n\nthe northernmost (southernmost) point in the cross section. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n- 73 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n \n\nAIRS RH (%) 7th August 2003\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\nAIRS RH (%) 26th August 2003\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\nAIRS  RH (%) 30th August 2003\n\n-1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35\nlatitude\n\n \n\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n0102030405060708090\n\nFigure 6.1 - Daily Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) relative humidity (RH) profiles along the GPCI cross \nsection (black diagonal line), together with 12 UTC GOES10 satellite infrared snapshots for August 7 (top row), \n\n26 (mid row), and 30 (bottom row), 2003 (see text for details). \n\nIn the first row in Fig. 6.1, dated August 7th, 2003, the GOES IR signal is relatively strong \n\nalong the entire cross section, with the proximity of a low pressure system in the mid-latitude \n\nNE Pacific, broken packs of low level cloudiness all the way from the subtropical \n\nstratocumulus (Sc) regions (northern segment of the transect) to the equatorial central Pacific, \n\nand a dormant ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone), at least in terms of the intensity of the \n\ndeep convection in the vicinities of the transect. Looking at the 25 % RH line (between red and \n\nbrown in the color scale), the AIRS RH transect clearly depicts an ITCZ centered at around \n\n8\u00b0N. Note also the relatively deep atmospheric boundary layer (BL), with a top (assumed, for \n\nthe trades and the Sc areas to be [in a first approximation] the 50 % RH [e.g., Siebesma et al. \n\n2004] line [between the yellow and green colors]) consistently at ~ 850 hPa to the north of \n\n14\u00b0N. A prominent feature in this plot is the relative maximum in RH centered at 26\u00b0N, \n\n- 74 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nconnecting the top of the BL to upper-level relatively high values of RH. In the mid row in Fig. \n\n6.1, dated August 26th, 2003, the GOES image shows, in contrast, an anemic infrared signal \n\n(basically spanning the entire portion of the tropical Pacific shown), associated with an active \n\nITCZ, and a more homogeneous low level cloudiness field, extending southward along the \n\ncross section, from the subtropical Sc area to the trades (around 20\u00b0N, see the location of the \n\nHawaiian Islands), where the cloudiness is broken, with the darker areas much probably \n\nassociated with relatively clear skies. Note also the inexistence of any important mid-latitude \n\ncyclonic disturbance affecting the \u201carea of catchment\u201d of the section. Accordingly, and \n\ncomparatively to the situation on August 7, the AIRS RH vertical cross section has a moister \n\nITCZ, with a more well defined (and vertical) northern (RH) \u201cboundary\u201d (up until 300 hPa), \n\nand a generally lower BL top in the Sc area (especially to the north of 26\u00b0N). But, perhaps, the \n\nmore striking aspect is now the very dry area, roughly between 750 hPa and 450 hPa, to the \n\nnorth of 17\u00b0N. Note the minimum above the trades (17\u00b0N to 23\u00b0N), with values of ~ 5 %, or \n\nless, RH. On August 30th, 2003 (bottom row in Fig. 6.1), four days after the previous situation \n\ndescribed (mid row in Fig. 6.1), the region across the GPCI transect immediately to the east of \n\nthe Hawaiian Islands, witnessed the peak strength of Jimena, by then a hurricane with \n\nsustained winds slightly over 160 km/h \n\n(http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2003/jimena/jimena.php). This is clearly the main \n\ndeparture from what is seen in the previous GOES image (note that the Sc decks appear even \n\nmore well defined on August 30). Jimena shows in the AIRS profiles centered at 20\u00b0N, and \n\nlends the RH cross-section a look that resembles a double ITCZ. \n\nIn conclusion, the broad potential uses of the AIRS data are here undoubtedly displayed, even \n\n6.1.3 Matching models and observations \n\nA common feature of most of the studies referenced above (see [AIRS] Validation efforts, in \n\nin view of some of the physical processes affecting cloud formation and evolution discussed in \n\nChapter\u2019s 2 [Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans] Section 2.3 (e.g., the \n\nimpacts of free tropospheric humidity on the subtropical Sc cloud decks). \n\nSection 6.1.1) is the focus on the observational validation, i.e., an assessment based on \n\ncollocated, usually contemporaneous, matches between AIRS retrievals and the chosen \n\ncorrelative truth. Of primary importance in climate studies, though, are the uncertainties and \n\nbiases that may arise from the temporal and spatial sampling characteristics of a certain \n\ninstrument, and or remote sensing platform, and, particularly, their potential \n\n- 75 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nlimitations/strengths under different atmospheric conditions. Moreover, in this context, it is \n\nfrequently found that purely observational biases are only a small portion of total biases. \n\nSeparating sampling induced misrepresentation of atmospheric state from the other error \n\nprocesses is one of the great challenges of validating and using satellite datasets. \n\nOn the other hand, in validating model results with observations it is usually recommendable to \n\n AIRS RH dataset \n\n spatially match the observational and the simulated records of relative \n\ne vertical, recall that the preliminary procedure \n\nadapt the numerical simulations output to the spatial and temporal resolutions of the \n\nobservational dataset. This is generally done by applying certain constrains, thresholds, or \n\ncompositing the model record. Naturally, this mindset can be reversed in case the available \n\nmodel data is, in any particular perspective, more limited than the observational data. \n\nRelatively sophisticated methodologies have been developed with these concerns in mind, \n\nbeing the ISCCP simulator (see Section 3.4, Observational datasets) a good example of the \n\nefforts toward more meaningful comparisons of models and observations. \n\nThis section presents the methodologies followed to characterize the\n\nprepared for GPCI introduced above. As the investigation of observational biases is outside the \n\nscope of this study, the main focus is on sampling biases, and potential consequences to the \n\nresults presented in the following sections. \n\nSpatial matching \n\nHorizontal    To\n\nhumidity was the first task to be accomplished. First of all, the model data was made available \n\nby the different centers already along the cross section, following the GPCI specifications \n\n(which did not suggest any particular way to extract the results to the 13 points comprising the \n\ntransect, or to the grid cells in the broader 2D maps [Section 3.2.2, Project protocol]). The \n\nparticipating centers reported the use of different techniques for that end (e.g., nearest grid \n\npoint, bilinear interpolation). Table 3.1 shows the horizontal resolution and number of vertical \n\nlevels of the different models. In the case of the AIRS data, the original 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 latitude-\n\nlongitude grid had to be degraded to the 5\u00b0 \u00d7 5\u00b0 resolution of the 2D maps, and to the 13 \n\nlocations along the GPCI transect. Given that the GPCI points coincided with grid nodes in the \n\nAIRS dataset, it was decided to take the average RH of the nearest 4 AIRS grid nodes to get \n\nthe values for the 2D and transect locations. \n\nVertical    Regarding the matching in th\n\nfollowed to obtain RH from the AIRS temperature and specific humidity retrievals (Section \n\n6.1.2), used an inferred (linear) temperature profile between adjacent (temperature) pressure \n\n- 76 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nlevels to calculate the column saturation vapor pressure from the humidity value for the \n\ncorresponding sublayer. This means that the RH information on the AIRS vertical grid actually \n\napplies to the sublayer above the pressure levels themselves. To better correlate models and \n\nobservations, the relative humidity profiles were linearly interpolated in the vertical (at each \n\none of the GPCI locations) to a common 10 hPa -spaced regular pressure grid (the AIRS data \n\nwas analogously interpolated in the vertical). The interpolated model simulations correspond \n\nthus to point values. An alternative would be to further integrate these values in the vertical for \n\neach (overlying) sublayer. This would require the assumption of a certain vertical profile for \n\nthe relative humidity in the sublayers, a procedure that was not adopted in the this work, also to \n\npreserve a higher degree of detail in the vertical. \n\nTemporal matching \n\nTo match the 3-hourly model output with the daily temporal resolution of the AIRS data, daily \n\nned, in this work it is assumed that, for the model simulations, the value \n\ns, the (unconstrained) JJA \n\nsimulation output. \n\naverages were calculated for the RH simulations. Apart from the seasonal averages and the \n\npercentages shown in the results that follow, all other calculations (e.g., variance [standard \n\ndeviation], moving averages [temporal evolution]) were performed on the daily record. \n\nSampling matching \n\nAs previously mentio\n\ncorresponding to the 80 % AIRS effective fractional cloud cover threshold is ~ 70 % TCC. \n\nThis value was then applied as an upper threshold for the selection, among the 3-hourly model \n\noutput, of only those profiles of RH contemporaneous with values of the TCC parameter below \n\n70 % (inclusive). The accrued RH profiles were then the basis for the calculation of the \n\n\u201cconstrained results\u201d used for a more direct comparison with AIRS. \n\nThe top row in Fig. 6.2 shows, for some of the participating model\n\n2003 mean TCC along the GPCI cross section. It also depicts the 70 % TCC (horizontal green) \n\nline, and the percentage of time TCC is less than or equal to 70 % at each one of the transect \n\nlocations, which is also the percentage of \u201cusable\u201d RH profiles according to the TCC constrain \n\n(TCC70% hereinafter). As expected, the locations mostly affected by the TCC70% constrain, \n\nare those with the highest average TCC values, pronouncedly the ITCZ region (~ 8\u00b0N), where \n\nthe number of usable profiles can be as low as ~ 20%, and the Sc regions (especially at 32\u00b0N). \n\nThe trades (~ 17\u00b0N to 20\u00b0N) are less affected by the constrain, showing, in two of the models, \n\nvalues that surpass 70%. Note that these percentages were obtained from the 3-hourly record of \n\n- 77 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 - Top row: June-July-August (JJA) 2003 mean total cloud cover (red line with triangles) along the \nGPCI cross section for four of the participating models (the horizontal green line marks the 70 % total cloud cover \n\nvalue), together with the respective percentages of occ nce of  total cloud cover less than or equal to 70 % \n(gray col\n\nTh e \n\nbetween (T  \n\niases in relation to weather and climatic patterns preponderant in different regions, \n\nurre\numns).

The\n\nresults show a general dry bias, especially between levels 800 hPa and 200 hPa, and between \n\n2\u00b0N and 17\u00b0N (around the ITCZ). This is in line with the fact that, in the ITCZ, higher values \n\nof TCC are typically associated with more intense deep convection and higher RH values at all \n\nlevels in the vertical. The models seem to produce this (note, however, the slight moist bias at \n\nlower levels in the ITCZ in NCAR). Regarding the Sc region, it is interesting to notice that the \n\nmodels with the highest TCCs in those areas (to the north of ~ 26\u00b0N) show, in these plots, a \n\nwet bias right above the boundary layer. Again, this is, potentially, a good sign for these \n\nmodels, since it is expected that higher Sc cloudiness to be associated with a relatively dry free \n\ntroposphere above the BL.

It is based on model simulations and AIRS observations for JJA 2003. \n\n6.2.1 Seasonal mean and variance \n\n2003. It qualitatively depicts the RH si\n\n(sub)tropical NE Pacific, with the ITCZ centered at 8\u00b0N (in June [not shown] the ITCZ is \n\nlocated between 5\u00b0N and 8\u00b0N, while in August [not shown] it is located between 8\u00b0N and \n\n11\u00b0N), a moist BL, and a relatively dry free troposphere, capped by higher RH values in the \n\ntropopause. A look at the daily record of AIRS RH transects indicates that this (typical \n\nclimatological) RH picture, not rarely, suffers disruption during the season, especially owing, \n\nfor instance, to the influence of baroclinic disturbances, in the northernmost part of the section, \n\nand tropical depressions and hurricanes, in the lower latitudes (see Fig. 6.1). Still, it is, mostly, \n\nthe sampling idiosyncrasy of the AIRS experiment (especially in what concerns the presence of \n\nclouds) that ultimately modulates the RH evolution in this particular dataset. In more detail, the \n\n- 79 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nmean RH section is characterized by a very moist BL, with values above 70 % at 1000 hPa \n\nalong the whole cross section (recall that, for AIRS, a value at 1000 hPa actually represents the \n\nlayer between 1000 hPa and 925 hPa), being over 95 % between just north of 20\u00b0N and the \n\nITCZ, a hint that the trades constitute an important source of the moisture that help fuel (via \n\nlatent heat release) the deep convection in the ITCZ (recall that the low-level atmospheric flow \n\nblows along the trades in the direction of the ITCZ, and experiences increasing sea surface \n\ntemperatures [SSTs]). Regarding the top of the BL (BLT), if one takes the 50 % RH line to be \n\na proxy for its location (e.g., Siebesma et al. 2004), the BLT is at its lowest position at 35\u00b0N, at \n\n~ 940 hPa, and deepens southward until a value of ~ 860 hPa, at 17\u00b0N. Noteworthy is also the \n\n(overall) southward intensification (weakening) of the vertical gradient of RH just below \n\n(above) the BLT between those two positions. For July (not shown) the southward deepening \n\nof the BL is the steepest, while for August (not shown) the BLT is close to 850 hPa for most of \n\nthe transect between 20\u00b0N and 32\u00b0N. In the vertical, the seasonal ITCZ is characterized by a \n\ndome-shaped structure capped by a layer of RH with values as high as 50 % up to ~ 530 hPa. \n\nAt 500 hPa, there is a minimum in the amount, and latitudinal extent, of the ITCZ RH, with the \n\nlayers above showing the reverse picture until the tropical tropopause is reached at ~ 150 hPa \n\n(at 8\u00b0N). Finally, the driest portion of the vertical section is found in a layer between 650 hPa \n\nand 450 hPa (mid troposphere), essentially extending from the trades to the Sc (in the northern \n\nportion of the section), and showing values below 20 % RH. This minimum is associated with \n\nthe large scale atmospheric subsidence that characterizes the dynamics of the subtropical free \n\natmosphere. In June (not shown) that domain is even broader, both vertically and horizontally, \n\nand the RH falls below 10 % in a thin layer centered at 600 hPa between latitudes 26\u00b0N and \n\n29\u00b0N. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3 - June-July-August 2003 vertical structure of relative humidity (RH) along the GPCI cross section as \nseen in the mean (left plot) and standard deviation (right plot) taken from AIRS observations. \n\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\nlatitude\n\nAIRS  RH mean (%) AIRS RH std dev (%)\n\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n0102030405060708090\n\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\nlatitude\n\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n- 80 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nT  \n\nodels presented in Fig. 6.2, JJA 2003 cross sections of \n\nhe right plot in Fig. 6.3 shows the corresponding RH standard deviation for JJA 2003. Note\n\nthat both plots in this figure use the same color scale. There is an outstanding difference \n\nbetween the structure of the mean RH and the corresponding standard deviation field, with the \n\nstandard deviation assuming notoriously lower values (below 25 %). One of the areas that \n\nshows the least variability in humidity extends from 23\u00b0N to (at least) the south end of the \n\ncross section, and is found generally below 900 hPa, coinciding with the area of highest mean \n\nRH values. In contrast, relatively high values of standard deviation (15 % to 20 %) are found in \n\na layer with a constant top close to 890 hPa between 35\u00b0N and 26\u00b0N (Sc region). This feature \n\nis probably associated with the local variability in the location of the BLT. Lower standard \n\ndeviation values (10 % to 15 %), homogeneously spread between 20\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N, and 870 hPa \n\nand 450 hPa, are an indication of the relative steadiness of the subtropical subsidence during \n\nJJA 2003. Another interesting detail in this plot is the minimum that extends in the vertical to \n\nabout 600 hPa roughly between 2\u00b0N and 8\u00b0N, in clear contrast with the higher values found \n\nimmediately to the north of it. This may, in part, be explained by the northward shift of the \n\nITCZ during the season, an argument, in part, supported by the higher values in the vertical to \n\nthe south of 2\u00b0N. Finally, the highest values of RH standard deviation for JJA 2003 are mainly \n\nfound between 2\u00b0N and 11\u00b0N, centered between 300 hPa and 400 hPa, at the base (and mostly \n\ntowards the south) of the upper-level relative maximum of (mean) RH associated with the \n\ntropical tropopause above the ITCZ. \n\nFigure 6.4 shows, for the same four m\n\nseasonal mean RH, RH standard deviation, and the corresponding biases versus the respective \n\nAIRS results. Keep in mind that these are (TCC70%) constrained results. All the models show, \n\nin the RH means (column to the left), the general features associated with the RH signature of \n\nthe Hadley circulation described above for AIRS (left plot in Fig. 6.3), and in a previous \n\nchapter, for the unconstrained model results (Fig. 4.4). Regarding the comparison with the \n\nAIRS seasonal mean RH (second column from the left), there are significant biases in these \n\nmodels, namely: i) a very important negative bias in the lowest portion of the BL (except to the \n\nnorth of 32\u00b0N); ii) in contrast with a strong wet bias immediately above it, along the whole \n\ntransect (except for NCAR, with the wet bias confined between 11\u00b0N and 20\u00b0N), a situation \n\nassociated with deeper BLs in the models than in AIRS; iii) in the deep convection area \n\n(around 8\u00b0N), there is (above a surface dry bias extending up to ~ 900 hPa) a wet bias between \n\n~ 800 hPa and ~ 450 hPa, associated with, not just higher RHs going to higher levels, but also \n\nwith wider ITCZs than in AIRS (the exception being ECMWF, with a slightly narrower ITCZ);

Still, although the models show, overall, higher RH \n\nvariability, there are distinct features in the comparison with AIRS. The right column in Fig. \n\n6.4 shows a lack of variability in RH in the BL along the entire cross section, with models \n\npresenting negative standard deviation biases of up to -20 % in the subtropical BL (23\u00b0N to \n\n35\u00b0N) (recall that the variance is evaluated from the daily averaged model output and not from \n\nthe 3-hourly record). This is probably associated with the simulation of persistently deep \n\nsubtropical BLs, as in the ECMWF and UKMO models. Another noteworthy feature is the \n\npositive bias just above the BL (particularly north of 20\u00b0N). More so than a model deficiency, \n\nthis is probably associated with the relatively poor vertical resolution of this AIRS dataset, \n\nwhich may not the able to detect the finer detail in the variability of the vertical location of the \n\nBL top, particularly in the subtropics. \n\n6.2.2 Intraseasonal evolution \n\nTo qualitatively investigate how the vertical structure of RH evolves during the JJA season, 5-\n\nations \n\nday running means of the RH record were obtained for different locations in the GPCI cross \n\nsection (the details are given above in Bias, moving averages, and standard deviation \n\ncalculation). The corresponding JJA 2003 results for AIRS and two of the participating models \n\nare shown in Fig. 6.5. Again, the model results are obtained from the (TCC70%) composited \n\nRH profiles, being the vertical white columns in the plots, gaps arising from (at least) five \n\nconsecutive days with TCCs above 70 %. From the discussion of Fig. 6.2, this situation is \n\nexpected to occur more frequently in the NCAR model than in the BMRC model, and, for any \n\nof the models, more frequently in the deep convection and Sc regions, than in the trades. \n\nLooking at the larger set of models, a general first conclusion is that, for the three loc\n\nshown (8\u00b0N, 20\u00b0N, and 32\u00b0N), there seems to be, overall, a better spatiotemporal correlation \n\nbetween any two given models than between the models and AIRS. It is also immediately \n\napparent that the comparison of models and AIRS in terms of the humidity content in the BL, \n\nITCZ, and subtropical mid troposphere, presented above, is still patent in these results, \n\nparticularly in what concerns the model biases in the lowest levels along the transect, and the \n\ndepth of the BL. What these plots put in evidence is essentially the fact that, at 32\u00b0N, the RH \n\nvariations tend to be coherent throughout the entire profile, as opposed to having (especially at \n\n20\u00b0N [trades]) periods when a drying of the mid troposphere is accompanied by a moistening \n\nat upper levels. This seems to point out to the need to include in the investigation of the \n\n- 83 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nbreakup of the Sc cloud decks that happens in the transition to the trade-wind shallow cumulus, \n\nthe influence, not just of the humidity structure in the free troposphere immediately above the \n\nBL, but also of the humidity profile all the way to the upper troposphere. A synergistic \n\napproach between AIRS and other instruments onboard Aqua could be tried to tackle this \n\nissue. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 - June-July-August (JJA) 2003 5-day runnin means of the vertical distribution of relative humidity \n(RH evolution) at three different locations along the PCI cross section (8\u00b0N, 20\u00b0N, and 32\u00b0N), for AIRS \n\n6.3 Is relative humidity a driver for cloud transition? \n\nTo answer this question, this section is divided into three main sections. Section 6.3.1 (Relative \n\ng \nG\n\nobservations (top row) and two participating models (mid and bottom rows). \n\nhumidity as a proxy for boundary layer depth) presents a brief bibliographical review on \n\nboundary layer top determination. In section 6.3.2 (A new scheme to determine the BLT) the \n\nadequacy of relative humidity for the assessment of basic characteristics of the NE Pacific \n\nmaritime atmospheric boundary layer, such as its depth and inversion strength, is explored \n\nresorting to a new scheme for the determination of the top of the boundary layer.

Section 6.3.3 (Cloud cover \n\ntransitions) revisits the topic of abrupt transitions in cloud cover along the GPCI transect, \n\nfirstly, by introducing an updated methodology for the location of these discontinuities in the \n\ncloud fields. The corresponding results are then used as guidance for the calculation of the \n\nspatial averages of relative humidity profiles, composited as located upwind, or downwind, of \n\nthe location of the strong cloud cover gradients thus found during the JJA 2003 season in data \n\nfrom models and analysis. \n\n6.3.1 Relative humidity as a proxy for boundary layer depth \n\nOwing to the complexity of its phenomenology, the boundary layer has been given a great deal \n\nof attention in observational and in modelling studies. Simulation of boundary layer clouds in \n\nglobal climate models is still a challenge (e.g., Weare 2004; Bony and Dufresne 2005; Teixeira \n\net al. 2008b; Karlsson et al. 2008), and would benefit from a better understanding of the \n\nobserved behaviour of the planetary boundary layer. In this context a few related studies can be \n\nhighlighted, namely: Seibert et al. (2000) thoroughly review and compare operational methods \n\nfor the determination of the height of the atmospheric boundary layer (e.g., methods that use \n\nprofile data from measurements [radiosonde profiles, sodar and wind profiler data] or from \n\nnumerical model output, and mixing height parameterization using simple equations or \n\nmodels); Karlsson et al. (2010), present a cloud-top height (CTH) approach (discussed in \n\nSection 5.1.4 of this work) for the determination of the (sub)tropical maritime boundary layer \n\ntop (BLT) from satellite observations, reanalysis data, and climate model simulations (an \n\nexample among other satellite-based methodologies developed to tackle the issue of the \n\ndetermination of the BLT on a global scale from satellite data); passive-sensor CTH methods \n\n(e.g., Minnis et al. 1992; Wood and Bretherton 2004; Zuidema et al. 2009) have been \n\nsuccessfully applied in regions dominated by low level (stratocumulus) clouds (e.g., Stevens et \n\nal. 2007); spaceborn lidars (active sensors) have been used to estimate the boundary layer \n\nheight (BLH) from observed CTHs in stratocumulus areas (e.g., Ahlgrimm and Randall 2006; \n\nLin et al. 2009); based on satellite retrieved vertical distributions of temperature and humidity, \n\nother studies have tried to locate the inversion that typically caps the maritime boundary layer, \n\ne.g., Fetzer et al. (2004), using AIRS, and von Engeln et al. (2005), using radio occultation \n\ndata; in addition to CTH, Karlsson et al. (2010) present an alternative technique to determine \n\nBLT and estimate BLH from the vertical gradient of relative humidity. \n\n- 85 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nMore specifically, Karlsson et al. (2010) used \u201cthe height of the maximum vertical RH gradient \n\nwith respect to pressure\u201d found between the surface and 700 hPa. The method was successfully \n\napplied along the GPCI cross section to models, analysis, and AIRS observations, and the \n\nresults showed, mostly in the subtropics, a fairly good agreement with the CTH-based BLT \n\nestimate for the same models and analysis, and MISR (Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer) \n\nobservations. In the next section, an updated version of the RH-based methodology is \n\nintroduced. It basically consists of additional conditions imposed to the evaluation of the RH \n\nprofile in a sequence of stages of increasing constrain refinement. The methodology has thus \n\nbeen named sBLT, for sequential Boundary-Layer-Top determination scheme. \n\nThe introduction to sBLT starts with a brief overview of the main concepts behind its \n\noperation, followed by a description of the basic algorithm and subsequent steps for the \n\ndetermination of the BLT from a given RH profile. The section then proceeds to a discussion \n\nof a number of statistics to characterize the climatological BLT for a given location. After a \n\nfew additional remarks, and the presentation of developments envisioned for the near future, \n\npreliminary results are discussed for a few case studies. sBLT statistics for JJA 2003 along the \n\nGPCI transect are analyzed for models, and atmospheric analysis. To close the section, the \n\nsame kind of statistics are presented for the corresponding AIRS RH record. \n\n6.3.2 A new scheme to determine the BLT \n\nThe RH results analyzed up to this point in the thesis, obtained from models and observations, \n\neither as seasonal climatologies, or at particular times during the JJA season (Fig. 4.4, Fig. 6.1, \n\nFig 6.3, Fig. 6.4, and Fig 6.5), show that in the (sub)tropical NE Pacific the MBL is typically \n\nvery moist, at least as seen along the GPCI cross section. Moreover, there is, for all of the \n\ntransect locations in all those results, a marked upward decrease in RH at some point in the \n\nvertical profile, separating the moist lower levels from a relatively dry mid troposphere. It is \n\nknown that these are important features of the (sub)tropical MBL, and that, in particular, the \n\nsharp decrease in RH is typically associated with the approximate location of its top. Locating \n\nthe level of the strong decrease in RH has been the basic motive behind a number of RH-based \n\nBLT determination methods recently proposed in the literature (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2010, \n\nMartins et al. 2010). Introduced below, sBLT is yet another such proposal. RH is believed to \n\nbe a befitting variable for this purpose owing to the fact that it depends on both temperature \n\nand humidity. \n\n- 86 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n6.3.2.1 Basic concepts \n\nHumidity Profile    The sBLT methodology is solely based on the manipulation of relative \n\nhumidity data (observational, or simulated) given in the form of vertical profiles spanning the \n\nlayer from the surface to (ideally) the upper troposphere. In the first data treatment step, \n\nprofiles are screened for bad values (inexistent data, or RH &lt;0 % [RH > 100 % is, at this stage, \n\nincluded in the analysis]), being disregarded if a bad data entry is found at one or more levels. \n\nIn the second step, the RH information is interpolated to a regularly-spaced vertical grid (in \n\nwhat follows, the RH is assumed to be on a vertical pressure grid). The interpolation to a \n\ncommon vertical grid is especially useful when dealing with RH information from different \n\nsources, either used in combination, or for the purposes of comparison between different \n\ndatasets. Specific issues arising from the interpolation procedure are discussed later (see \n\nAdditional Remarks). \n\nRH-Gradient Profile    Once a RH profile has been screened and interpolated, it is used for \n\nthe calculation of the corresponding RH-gradient (RHgrad) profile. The RH and pressure \n\ninformation for two adjacent levels is used such that the RHgrad for the layer bounded by the \n\ntwo levels is obtained dividing the RH difference between the top and bottom levels by the \n\ndifference in pressure between the bottom and top levels. This value is then assigned to the mid \n\nlevel for that layer (this implies that the levels in the RHgrad profile correspond to the mid \n\nlevels of the original RH profile). Given the pressure drop going up in the profile, this assures \n\nthat a positive (negative) RHgrad corresponds to an increase (a decrease) in RH between the \n\nbottom and the top levels of the layer in question. \n\nUpper Threshold    For a given sublayer in the RH profile, the upper threshold (ut) is the RH \n\nvalue at the respective top level (this level is then called put). \n\nLower Threshold    For a given sublayer in the RH profile, the lower threshold (lt) is the RH \n\nvalue at the respective bottom level (this level is then called plt). \n\nLower Cumulative Average Line    For a given sublayer in the RH profile, the lower \n\ncumulative average line (local) starts at the respective plt, where it is equal to lt, and is built all \n\nthe way to the bottom of the profile, taking, at each profile level, a value equal to the \n\ncumulative average of the RHs from all the levels between it (inclusive) and the plt. The local \n\nis also assigned to the corresponding RHgrad level, i.e., the midlevel of the sublayer in the RH \n\nprofile. The local should be seen as a continuous line, with values between the profile levels \n\nobtained from the linear interpolation of the local values at respective adjacent levels. \n\n- 87 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nS1 index    A given level in the RHgrad profile is classified as S1 if the corresponding RHgrad \n\nis different than zero (irrespective of the sign). As an index, S1 can be 0, or 1, respectively \n\nwhen RHgrad is 0, or RHgrad is different than zero. \n\nS2 index    If a given level in the RHgrad profile is a S1, it will be classified (also) as a S2 if \n\nthe corresponding RHgrad is negative (i.e., RH decreases between the bottom and the top \n\n[levels] of the respective sublayer in the RH profile). As an index, S2 will be 1 if RHgrad is \n\nnegative, and 0 otherwise. \n\nS3 index    If a given level in the RHgrad profile is a S2, it will be classified (also) as a S3 if \n\nthe corresponding local is never lower than the corresponding ut (in which case S3 = 1). In \n\ncase the local gets to be lower than ut, S3 will be given a value between 0 (exclusive) and 1 \n\n(exclusive), obtained from the division of the difference in pressure between the point where \n\nthe local (first [going from plt toward the bottom of the profile]) gets to be equal to ut and the \n\nplt, by the difference in pressure between the bottom of the RH profile and plt. S3 will only be \n\n0 if S2 is equal to 0. S3 is the only continuous S# index. \n\nS4 index    If a given level in the RHgrad profile is a S2, it will be classified (also) as a S4 if, at \n\nthe bottom of the RH profile, the corresponding local is not lower than lt. In that case S4 is \n\nequal to 1, being equal to 0 otherwise (i.e., if S2 = 0, or the local is lower than lt at the bottom \n\nof the RH profile). Note that there isn\u2019t, at this point, any direct link between S4 and S3, in the \n\nsense that a level in the RHgrad profile can be a S4 without it (fully) being a S3. The only \n\ncommonality arises from the fact that both S3 (full or partial) and S4 need to be a S2. A link \n\nbetween S3 and S4 is imposed at a later stage in the scheme (as explained below at sS#). \n\nS# Order    There is an order implied in the S# classification. A level classified as a S4 is said \n\nto be higher in the classification order, than a level that could not be classified as being more \n\nthan a S3, and so on. \n\nS# Classification of the RHgrad Profile    Before proceeding to the basic sBLT algorithm, \n\neach level in the RHgrad profile has to be classified following the sequence of S# indexes \n\npresented above. The input information for the basic algorithm is, for each level (mid level) in \n\nthe RHgrad (RH) profile: 1) pressure; 2) RHgrad strength (absolute value of RHgrad); 3) \n\nRHgrad sign; 4) S1 index; 5) S2 index; 6) S3 index; and 7) S4 index. \n\nThe S Profile    A S profile is obtained by locating in the RHgrad profile the levels with the \n\nstrongest full S# indexes, that is, for each one of the (four) S# = 1, the one with the highest \n\nRHgrad strength (irrespective of the sign) is picked to represent S# in the S profile. It can then \n\n- 88 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nhappen that a S profile may not have a S3 determined (if all are 0 &lt;S3 &lt;1), even if it has a S4 \n\ndetermined. Another possible situation is the one for which the same level in the RHgrad \n\nprofile is assigned all four S#, i.e., it has the strongest S1, which, in turn is also a S2, a (full) \n\nS3, and a S4. \n\nThe strict S# (sS#)    If a level classified as a S4 is only a partial S3, i.e., 0 &lt;S3 &lt;1, then its \n\nsS# will only be a sS2, that is, it will, in the more strict sense, be classified as a sS2. This arises \n\nfrom the fact that, the sS# classification sequence starts at the lowest S# (S1) and chooses it as \n\nthe sS# if S(#+1) is not 1, thus stopping at S2 if S3 is only partial, even if S4 is equal to 1. This \n\nimposes a tight link between sS3 and sS4, and ensures that, when analyzing the final sBLT \n\nresults, any BLT classified as a sS4 is known to be a sS3 as well (i.e., a full S3 [S3 = 1]). More \n\nimportantly, a sS# is never a sS(#+1). Even when only a partial S3, S4 levels are, nevertheless, \n\nuseful for the purposes of initialization of the basic sBLT algorithm. \n\n6.3.2.2 The basic sBLT algorithm \n\nFour main steps comprise the basic sBLT algorithm, they are ordered as follows: \n\n1: In the RHgrad profile, identification of the level with the strongest RHgrad (irrespective of \n\nthe sign) among the levels with the highest S# classification (see S# Order above). The search \n\nis performed only on full S# indexes, i.e., S# = 1 (any S# = 0, or 0 &lt;S3 &lt;1, are disregarded at \n\nthis step). \n\n2: Using the level chosen at step 1: as a reference, proceed down in the profile, and elect it as \n\nthe BLT if: the level is already the lowest level in the RHgrad profile; or, all levels below it are \n\nas high as it is in the S# classification order; or, all levels below it are either sS1, or S1 = 0. \n\n3: If at step 2: no BLT has been determined, then, using the level chosen at step 1: as a \n\nreference, proceed down in the profile to the level with the strongest RHgrad that is stronger \n\nthan the RHgrad of the reference level, chosen among the levels classified as S(r-1), being Sr \n\nthe classification of the reference level. In case no level is found to meet the condition, the \n\nsearch is instead performed among the levels classified as S(r-2). And so on. The search stops \n\nat S2, i.e., this search is not to be performed among levels classified as S1. \n\n4: If at step 3: a level has been found to meet the imposed condition, it is then taken to step 2: \n\nof the algorithm and subject to the same scrutiny going down the algorithm step sequence. On \n\nthe other hand if no level has been found to meet the condition imposed at step 3:, the \n\nreference level from step 1: is chosen as the BLT for the profile being analyzed. \n\n- 89 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nS! The following information is then stored for S!, the BLT determined by the basic algorithm: \n\n1) pressure (keep in mind that this is a level of the RHgrad profile corresponding to a mid level \n\nof the original RH profile); 2) RHgrad strength (absolute value of RHgrad); 3) RHgrad sign; \n\nand 4) sS#. \n\nNote that S! can only be a S1 if no level in the RHgrad profile has been classified as higher that \n\nS1. \n\n6.3.2.3 BLT determination \n\nPartial-Profile Looping    In the partial-profile loop, S! are obtained for all and each one of \n\nthe subprofiles that are embedded in the full RHgrad profile, that is, starting with the full \n\nRHgrad profile (i.e., the one with the bottom at the lowest RHgrad profile level and the top at \n\nthe highest RHgrad profile level), each successive profile with the bottom at the lowest \n\nRHgrad profile level and the top at the RHgrad profile level right below the top level of the \n\nprevious subprofile. The first subprofile in this sequence is then the full profile itself, the \n\nsecond subprofile will have its top at the level just below the top of the first subprofile, and so \n\non. The final result is a catalogue of all the S! thus obtained, and, in particular, the number of \n\ntimes/subprofiles for which a given RHgrad level has been chosen as the S!. \n\nS! Dp    With the information from the partial-profile loop it is possible to determine, for each \n\nRHgrad level ever chosen as a S!, the corresponding lifespan, i.e., the RHgrad profile span \n\ncomprised between the tops of the first and last subprofiles for which it has been chosen as the \n\nS!. Note that the operation of the basic algorithm described above implies that the RHgrad \n\nlevel in question was continuously chosen as the S! during the respective portion of the partial-\n\nprofile loop sequence. Defining ftop as the pressure at the RH-profile level just above the top \n\nlevel of the first subprofile, and ltop as the pressure at the RH-profile level just below the top \n\nlevel of the last subprofile (recall that the RHgrad profile levels correspond to mid levels of the \n\nRH profile), Dp is calculate, for all RHgrad levels ever chosen as the S!, as the difference \n\nbetween the respective ltop and ftop (Dp = ltop - ftop). \n\n7.S1    For the purposes of comparison of the sBLT results with the results that would be \n\nobtained following the RH-based BLT determination technique of Karlsson et al. (2010) (JK10 \n\nhereinafter), the strongest RHgrad for the subprofile with ftop = 700 hPa is identified. Once \n\nlocated, the level corresponding to this (strongest) RHgrad is stored as 7.S1, where S1 comes \n\nfrom the fact that this specific RHgrad is the S1 that would have been chosen for the S profile \n\n- 90 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n(see details above at The S Profile) corresponding to the RHgrad profile with ftop at 700 hPa. \n\nKeep in mind that JK10 focused solely on the RH information below 700 hPa. Also, since \n\nJK10 does not make explicit reference to the sign of the gradient, it is here assumed that S1 \n\nwould be their choice (recall that an S1 in the S profile may not necessarily be an S2). \n\n7.S2    In addition to the search for 7.S1, it can be of interest to find 7.S2, which is the S2 that \n\nwould have been chosen for the S profile (see details above at The S Profile) corresponding to \n\nthe RHgrad profile with ftop at 700 hPa. Note that 7.S2 is the strongest RHgrad with negative \n\nsign, i.e., the strongest RH decrease with height, found in the RHgrad profile with ftop at 700 \n\nhPa. \n\nPPtop    As will be seen below, it may be of interest to find, in the RHgrad profile, the level \n\nwith the highest Dp. In a more general situation this search can be performed on only a specific \n\n(intermediate) portion of the RHgrad profile. In case the search is to be done between the \n\nbottom and a specific level of the RHgrad profile, the level with the highest Dp thus found is \n\nsaid to be associated with PPtop, where PP stands for partial profile, and top is a given pressure \n\nvalue (e.g., 650 hPa). If top is the pressure at the top of the (full) RHgrad profile, PPtop is \n\ncalled FP (for full profile). Note that, in either case (intermediate portion of the profile, FP, or \n\nPPtop) the Dp values are the ones obtained from the analysis of the RHgrad profile as a whole. \n\nFinal sBLT Solution    The final sBLT solution is the BLT corresponding to the RHgrad level \n\nwith the highest Dp. As mentioned above, the choice can be made among only the RHgrad \n\nlevels comprised between a particular portion of the RHgrad profile, although, typically, the \n\nfinal sBLT solution is obtained for, either the FP, or a given PPtop. The following information \n\nis then stored for the final sBLT solution: 1) pressure (keep in mind that this is a level of the \n\nRHgrad profile corresponding to a mid level of the original RH profile); 2) RHgrad strength \n\n(absolute value of RHgrad); 3) RHgrad sign; 4) sS#; and 5) whether the final solution is, or \n\nnot, the 7.S1 (the values for this parameter are then 1, or 0, respectively). It should be stressed \n\nat this point that a sS# is never a sS(#+1). But, as mentioned above [The strict S# (sS#)], a sS# \n\nis necessarily a sS(#-1). For instance, it can never happen that a level classified as a sS1 is \n\nsimultaneously a sS2 (or above), meaning that a sS1 is strictly an increase in RH with height. \n\nThis is in clear contrast with the situation for the S profile, for which a S# can be a S(#+1). \n\n6.3.2.4 Climatological BLT characterization \n\n- 91 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nThe sBLT methodology can be applied to a single RH profile or to a number of profiles in a \n\ngiven spatiotemporal domain, in which case a number of statistics are typically obtained. Note \n\nthat, a prerequisite for the statistical analysis, is that all individual elements of the sBLT \n\nsolutions set, for a spatiotemporal domain of interest, need to have been found for a common \n\nPPtop. \n\nBLT Level    The mean pressure for all the final sBLT solutions [point 1) of Final sBLT \n\nSolution above]. \n\nBLT Strength    The mean RHgrad strength for all the final sBLT solutions [point 2) of Final \n\nsBLT Solution above (again, RHgrad strength is the absolute value of RHgrad)]. \n\nsS# Distribution    The histogram of sS# for the final sBLT solutions [point 4) of Final sBLT \n\nSolution above]. \n\nnot7.S1    Two things are evaluated for this statistic, one is the percentage (among the set of \n\nBLTs determined for the particular spatiotemporal domain) of final sBLT solutions that do not \n\ncoincide with 7.S1 [a value of zero for the parameter in point 5) of Final sBLT Solution \n\nabove], and the other is the percentage (among the set of BLTs determined for the particular \n\nspatiotemporal domain) of final sBLT solutions with pressures [point 1) of Final sBLT \n\nSolution above] less than 700 hPa. \n\n6.3.2.5 Additional remarks \n\nStrongest-S# Disambiguation    In case the highest RHgrad strength for a given S# (with an \n\nindex S# = 1) is found at two or more levels in the RHgrad profile, a disambiguation procedure \n\nis needed whenever it is desired to have only one level chosen. This is required, for instance, \n\nwhen trying to build a S Profile, or for the initialization of the basic sBLT algorithm, or to \n\ndetermine 7.S1. The currently adopted disambiguation procedure starts by looking at the value \n\nof the S(#+1) index for each one of the \u201cambiguous\u201d levels, and chooses the level for which \n\nthis index is the highest. If still there is the need for disambiguation in terms of the S(#+1) \n\nindex values, the procedure then looks at the value of the S(#+2) index for each one of the \n\nremaining (\u201cambiguous\u201d) levels, and so on. If the procedure gets all the way to the evaluation \n\nof the last index in the S# sequence, i.e., S4, and still two or more levels remain \n\n(\u201cambiguous\u201d), the one closest to the bottom of the profile is chosen. Note that the use of S3 as \n\na continuous (0 ? S3 ? 1) index is only applied for the purposes of this kind of disambiguation. \n\nFor any other uses, it is seen as a \u201c0 or 1\u201d index (like all the other S# indexes). In the particular \n\n- 92 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\ncase the set of levels that need to be disambiguated are nonadjacent to each other, this final \n\nchoice is based on the fact that the lowest level would (to the highest degree) be the one less \n\nmarked by relatively dry sublayers below it. In the particular case the set of levels that need to \n\nbe disambiguated are adjacent to each other (e.g., corresponding to sublayers obtained from the \n\ninterpolation of a larger sublayer of the original RH profile with a  given vertical rate of change \n\nfor RH), the final choice is based on the (first order) assumption that, at the top of the boundary \n\nlayer, the decrease of RH going up in the vertical is such that (locally) the corresponding \n\n(underlying [continuous]) RH curve is concave up, meaning that the highest decrease rate is \n\nfound right at the BLT. This feature would then not be as clear in discrete RH profiles, such as \n\nthe ones typically obtained from models and observations (especially if given in coarse vertical \n\nresolution). The disambiguation choice is then an attempt at getting closer to the actual BLT \n\n(this is revisited below at Future Developments). \n\nBasic sBLT Algorithm Initialization    By starting the basic algorithm at the level with the \n\nstrongest RHgrad among the levels with the highest S# classification, the sBLT scheme tries to \n\napply a first screening of the RHgrad profile for levels that overlay thick layers of dry air. Such \n\nRHgrad profile levels have the lowest probability of getting to the highest S# in the S# \n\nclassification sequence. Extremely dry air intrusions are thus assumed to be atypical \n\noccurrences in the (subtropical) maritime boundary layers. \n\nRegular p Profiles    Although the linear interpolation makes the vertical distribution of RH \n\nsmoother, the location of the main gradients in the profile should not change much if the new \n\nvertical grid is finer than the original grid. \n\nPPtop Choice    Given the fact that, ultimately, sBLT bases its operation on geometrical \n\nconsiderations, it is possible that, for specific types of RH profiles, the BLT determined for the \n\nFP is at a level not realistic for a boundary layer. Taking this into account, testing has been \n\nperformed to determine a reasonable value for PPtop. For the current sBLT implementation, \n\nthis value has been found to be top = 650 hPa, that is, PP650. Still, since the S! Dp values have \n\nto be calculated from the analysis of the RHgrad profile as a whole (see PPtop above), in \n\nsBLT, no portion of the RH profile is discarded from analysis (contrary to JK10, that focused \n\nsolely on the RH information below 700 hPa). Nevertheless, the FP results should always be \n\nanalyzed, and can be potentially valuable to check for model and observational dataset \n\ndeficiencies, namely, for the occurrence of unrealistically deep BLs. \n\nsBLT versus JK10    It should be stressed that sBLT allows for a straightforward comparison \n\nof its results with those that would be obtained following JK10. In fact, JK10 is embedded in \n\n- 93 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nsBLT. Note, however, that JK10 worked in model levels, and that no disambiguation \n\nprocedure was reported in that publication. Another advantage of using sBLT comes from the \n\nfact that, even in the cases when sBLT and JK10 coincide, sBLT can still give additional \n\ninformation, useful to further characterize the BLT and the BL beneath it, namely in what \n\nconcerns its sS# distribution statistic. This statistic is of special interest when comparing \n\ndifferent spatial and or temporal domains, since it has information on, e.g., the kind of RH \n\nstructure of the boundary layer, most typical in a given season or region. \n\nsBLT versus Critical-Threshold Methods    As mentioned above, with sBLT, the BLT is \n\ndetermined based on geometrical considerations. This seems to impart some robustness to the \n\nsBLT approach, particularly in the sense that it allows the determination of BLTs for a wider \n\nrange of situations (especially in terms of the humidity content of the BL) than approaches that \n\nimpose specific (typically minimum) thresholds to the vertical gradients of RH and or potential \n\ntemperature (e.g., Martins et al. 2010). \n\n6.3.2.6 Future developments \n\nTesting    sBLT is still in its development infancy. There is the need for further testing, \n\nespecially on case studies with carefully chosen RH profiles, for which the sBLT results would \n\nbe compared to the results from alternative RH-based (and other) methods (e.g., Fetzer et al. \n\n2004, von Engeln et al. 2005, Karlsson et al. 2010). \n\nDisambiguation Assumptions    It would be important to assess the robustness of the \n\nassumption that, at the top of the boundary layer, the decrease of RH going up in the vertical is \n\nsuch that (locally) the corresponding (underlying [continuous]) RH curve is concave up \n\n(meaning that the highest decrease rate is found right at the BLT). This issue, first raised above \n\nat Strongest-S# Disambiguation, could be investigated resorting to fine resolution observation \n\nof the BLT, e.g., from dedicated radiosonde or satellite observational campaigns. \n\nS1    In the current sBLT version, except for constant-RH profiles, a BLT is always \n\ndetermined, even if the S! out of the basic algorithm is a sS1. This implies that a BLT can be \n\nfound in a profile characterized by a combination of constant-RH layers and layers showing an \n\nincrease in RH with height, a case for which the BLT would end up corresponding to a RH \n\nincrease with height (a situation not thought to be realistic [at least for the typical subtropical \n\nMBL]). A future development would then be to further constrain the algorithm to determine \n\nBLTs only for sS2, or above, S! solutions, or, at least, disregard sS1 \u201cBLTs\u201d in the evaluation \n\n- 94 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nof the BLT Level and BLT Strength statistics, but still storing sS1 situations for supplemental \n\ninformation on the RH behaviour in the dataset in question. \n\nsBLT Statistics    Testing of sBLT results needs also to be done in a statistical framework. \n\nDevelopment of additional sBLT statistics should be a priority. \n\nnot7.S2    This is an example of a statistic that would be interesting to implement. It is similar \n\nto the not7.S1 statistic, but with the focus on 7.S2, instead. \n\n6.3.2.7 Case studies \n\nFigure 6.6 presents four case studies, chosen to illustrate basic sBLT concepts, and the \n\nresulting sBLT BLT for specific RH profiles. In Fig. 6.6a, the S profiles are shown for the full \n\n(bottom to top) and the 700 hPa (bottom to 700 hPa) profiles. Recall that a S profile is obtained \n\nby locating in the RHgrad profile the levels with the strongest RHgrad for each S# index (S# = \n\n1). f.S# and 7.S# are then the levels found for the full and the 700 hPa S profiles, respectively. \n\nApart from the S profiles, the level for the BLT solution of the basic sBLT algorithm is also \n\nshown (S!), with an indication of the respective sS# (in light gray). \n\n \n\n- 95 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.6 - Four vertical profiles of relative humidity (RH, black lines with open circles [at profile levels]), and \nrespective profiles of the vertical gradient of relative humidity (RH grad., gray lines with black crosses [at the mid \nlevels of the RH profiles]).

The thick black solid and dash lines indicate, respectively, the 700 hPa and \n\n650 hPa levels (see text for details). \n\nIt is immediately apparent that, for this (Fig. 6.6a) RHgrad profile, the two S profiles differ \n\nsubstantially, except for S4, that is the same in both S profiles. Additionally, this same S4 is, \n\nfor both, the solution of the basic algorithm.

Note as well, that 7.S1 does not coincide with 7.S2 for the fact that \n\nthe former corresponds to an increase of RH with height (a positive RHgrad.). As mentioned, \n\nthis 7.S1 is assumed to be the JK10\u2019s solution. But perhaps the most striking thing about the \n\ncase in Fig. 6.6a is the fact that 7.S2, the (mid) level with the strongest RH decrease in the 700 \n\nhPa profile, was not chosen by the basic sBLT algorithm as the BLT solution. This is an \n\nindication of the robustness of sBLT in being able to detect and manage intermediate dry \n\nlayers (e.g., associated with residual layers, or with dry intrusions). Figure 6.6b, illustrates the \n\nuse of a PP650. The final sBLT solution for this profile is indicated by the light gray thick line, \n\nsBLT!4. It is then the solution for a PP650 and corresponds to a sS4. Note how 7.S1 would not \n\nbe an adequate BLT for this profile. Figure 6.6c, shows a case for which the sBLT solution is \n\nabove 700 hPa. Finally, in Fig. 6.6d the FP sBLT solution seems unreasonable as a BLT, \n\nunlike the PP650 sBLT solution, which seems more realistic. For this profile, 7.S1 coincides \n\nwith the sBLT solution, itself a sS4. \n\n6.3.2.8 Model and analysis results \n\nThe results presented in the next two figures pertain to eight of the GPCI models and to one \n\natmospheric analysis dataset (ECMWFan). These results were obtained from the available 3-\n\nhourly records. \n\nIn the left plot in Fig. 6.7, the sBLT BLT Level statistic is presented for models and analysis \n\nalong the GPCI cross section as obtained for the JJA 2003 season. The transect average is also \n\ngiven for each model at the C position in the abscissa. The models included here are a subset of \n\nthe models shown in Fig. 5 of JK10 (except for JAMSTEC, that wasn\u2019t included in that study). \n\nAlthough the models aren\u2019t individually identified in JK10, it can be said, looking at the model \n\nspread, that there is, overall, a good agreement between the sBLT results and the findings by \n\nJK10. All models show: a similar BLT growth rate between 35\u00b0N (Sc, ~ 940 hPa model mean) \n\nand 17\u00b0N (shallow cumulus [ShCu], ~ 840 hPa model mean); the ITCZ (8\u00b0N) dip (at 14\u00b0N in \n\nGFDL, and inexistent in M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance); and, higher BLTs to the south of the ITCZ. The \n\nbiggest departure between sBLT and JK10 seems to be, for some of the models, deeper sBLT \n\nBLs found between 17\u00b0N and 20\u00b0N (in the trades). For the transect as a whole, NCEP and \n\nGFDL present the deepest and shallowest BLs, respectively; and, although deeper than \n\nM\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance in the Sc and ShCu regions, JAMSTEC has a transect average below the former, \n\nowing to a significant decrease in BLT height south of 17\u00b0N. By looking at mean RH sections \n\n- 97 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nfor some of these models, it can be concluded that the dip in BLT height in the ITCZ is \n\nassociated with a very moist surface overlaid by a relatively gentle RH decrease going up in \n\nthe deep convection area. Finally, from the fact that all models tend to show, in these results, \n\nbasically the same (close to constant) growth rate of BLT height, it could also be argued that \n\n(at least to a first approximation) their Sc BL representation in terms of simulated humidity \n\ncontent and BL depth is the main reason behind the departures found downwind in the ShCu \n\nBLTs. \n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35 C\n1000\n\n950\n\n900\n\n850\n\n800\n\n750\n\nJJA 2003JJA 2003\n\nB\nLT\n\n p\nre\n\nss\nur\n\ne \n(h\n\nP\na)\n\nlatitude\n\n UKMO\n NCAR\n NCEP\n GFDL\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35 C\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n1.4\n\n1.8\n\n2.2\n\n2.6\n\n3.0\n\nB\nLT\n\n s\ntre\n\nng\nth\n\n (%\n/h\n\nP\na)\n\nlatitude\n\n M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance\n ECMWFan\n JAMSTEC\n ECMWF\n BMRC\n\n \n\nFigure 6.7 - Mean June-July-August (JJA) 2003 boundary layer top (BLT) pressure (left plot) and strength (right \nplot) along GPCI for eight participating models and ECMWF analysis (ECMWFan), determined using the sBLT \n\nmethodology applied to relative humidity data (see text for details). \n\nThe right plot in Fig. 6.7, presents, for the same models and analysis, the sBLT BLT Strength \n\nstatistic.

The comparison between the whole-transect \n\nresults in both plots in Fig. 6.7 highlights some interesting differences among the datasets. \n\nNote, for instance, the case of ECMWFan and M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance, the two show in the left plot a \n\npractically coincident BLT in all points in the transect but differ substantially in the transect-\n\naveraged BLT strength with M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance showing lower values (note the striking departure in \n\nthe Sc areas). Finally, NCAR shows not just one of the lowest BLTs, but also one of the \n\nweakest. In fact, M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance and NCAR follow each other very closely in terms of the mean \n\nBLT strength along the cross section, though NCAR has a lower BLT in any of the transect \n\nlocations. \n\nThe sBLT sS# Distribution and not7.S1 statistics are presented in Fig. 6.8 for the same nine \n\ndatasets. \n\n- 98 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n \n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\n S1  S2  S3  S4 S1  S2  S3  S4 S1  S2  S3  S4\n\n S1  S2  S3  S4 S1  S2  S3  S4 S1  S2  S3  S4\n\n S1  S2  S3  S4 S1  S2  S3  S4\n\nUKMO\n\nUKMO\n\nNCEP\n\nNCEP\n\nNCAR\n\nNCAR\n\nM\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance\n\nM\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance\n\nJAMSTEC\n\nJAMSTEC\n\nGFDL\n\nGFDL\n\nECMWFan\n\nECMWFan\n\nECMWF\n\nECMWF\n\nBMRC\n\nBMRC\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n S1  S2  S3  S4\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa not7S1\n\n above700hPa\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nB\nLT\n\n v\ns.\n\n 7\nS\n\n1 \n(%\n\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n \n\nFigure 6.8 - June-July-August 2003 sS# Distribution (BLT S hist.) and not7.S1 (BLT vs. 7S1) statistics along \nGPCI for eight participating models and ECMWF analysis (ECMWFan), determined using the sBLT \n\nmethodology applied to relative humidity data (see text for details). \n\n- 99 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nT\n\nheight (pressure) information (e.g., \n\nhe results in Fig. 6.7 contain information more directly related to BLT characteristics, namely \n\nand strength, in turn, while showing BLT-related \n\n\u201cabove700hPa\u201d occurrence), Figure 6.8 presents, in addition, results that relate to the humidity \n\n(RH) characteristics of the BL itself, i.e., the portion of the atmosphere below the BLTs \n\ndetermined. The \u201cBLT S hist.\u201d occurrence histograms show how often the different BL types \n\noccur at each one of the transect locations, and in the cross section as a whole (at C in the \n\nabscissa). For instance, a sS4 BL is one for which the vertically-averaged RH is equal to, or \n\nabove, the highest of the two RH values used to evaluate the respective BLT strength (see the \n\nexplanations above at S1, S2, S3, and S4 index, and at sS#). The first aspect in the results \n\nshown is the rare occurrence of sS1 BLs (sS# is in these plots denoted as S#). Only three of the \n\nmodels show sS1, essentially in the deep convection area, and with less than ~ 3 % seasonal \n\noccurrence. A second notorious feature in these results is that sS4 BLs clearly dominate, both \n\nspatially and temporally, the exception being the JAMSTEC model for which sS4 has, for the \n\nsection as a whole, an occurrence of about 40 %. In this regard, the ITCZ (~ 8\u00b0N) is the area \n\nwhere sS4 BLs tend to occur less frequently, with five of the nine datasets showing values \n\nbelow 50 % seasonal occurrence. Overall, the second most dominant type of BL is sS3 that \n\ntend to occur more in the ITCZ. Models show important differences in the sS3 representation, \n\nwith JAMSTEC as the only model for which sS3 is the dominant type. In NCEP and UKMO, \n\nsS3 is as representative as sS2, with the later dominating the deep convection region, the area \n\nwhere sS2 occur more frequently in all of the datasets shown. Recall that a sS2 is necessarily \n\nnot a sS3, meaning that the sS2 BL is characterized by the presence of one or more layers of air \n\nwith RH lower than the lowest of the two RH values used to evaluate the respective BLT \n\nstrength. It is noteworthy that, for NCAR and M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance, sS4 dominates with more than 90 \n\n% occurrence in all of the transect locations. Still, although both models are very similar in \n\nterms of BLT strength, they differ in BLT height, with M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance showing deeper BLs, as \n\nmentioned above. Finally, recall that (only) geometrical considerations are implied in the sS# \n\ndetermination, such that, no information on the actual BL humidity content can be directly \n\ninferred from these results. The BL humidity content can be obtained from the kind of analysis \n\npresented in Fig. 4.4 (seasonal means of RH). Note, for instance, NCEP and UKMO, with \n\npractically the same BLT height, and very similar sS# histograms, to the north of 20\u00b0N, a \n\nsegment where the two differ the most in BLT strength. This situation is probably associated \n\nwith moister BLs in the UKMO simulations. \n\n- 100 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nRegarding the \u201cBLT vs. 7S1\u201d results, it is evident that it is in the ITCZ that most frequently the \n\nsBLT solution differs from the 7.S1 BLT (for GFDL the peak value is only ~ 1.5 %). As these \n\nsituations may arise from the simple fact that the sBLT solution falls above 700 hPa, the \n\n\u201cabove700hPa\u201d line indicates how frequently that was the case. The difference between those \n\ntwo statistics (the gray segment) thus indicates, for each location in the cross section, the \n\npercentage of time sBLT didn\u2019t coincide with 7.S1 while being below 700 hPa. Note, for \n\ninstance, that NCEP has, at 14\u00b0N, its mean BLT at ~ 810 hPa, well below 700 hPa, though \n\nhaving at the same location ~ 40 % occurrence of BLT above 700 hPa. To the north of 17\u00b0N \n\nboth the \u201cnot7S1\u201d and the \u201cabove700hPa\u201d lines are below 10 % in all models except NCEP. \n\nFinally, note that UKMO has ~ 50 % sS2 occurrence at 8\u00b0N, where \u201cnot7S1\u201d is ~ 80 %. This \n\nmeans that, at 8\u00b0N, for at least ~ 30 % of the time, an sS2 is not 7.S1. This can only occur in \n\ntwo different situations: 7.S1 is a sS1, i.e., an increase of RH with height; or, the level that \n\ninitiated the basic algorithm was at least a S3, and was located below a 7.S1 that was, \n\nsimultaneously, at least a S2. Only a not7.S2 sBLT statistic would allow a more definite \n\nanswer in these cases. \n\n6.3.2.9 Summertime statistics from daily AIRS data \n\nThe sBLT results for the JJA 2003 daily AIRS data are presented in Fig. 6.9. \n\nFor this AIRS dataset, no sS1 BLs have been determined, and the highest occurrence value for \n\neither sS2, or sS3 BLs is below 10 % (see the ITCZ area), meaning that sS4 BLs dominate, \n\nwith more than 95 % occurrence in the cross section as a whole. This is an indication of \n\nconsistently moist BLs, in the sense that the presence of intermediate dry layers is probably \n\nrare. This fact may also arise from the relatively coarse vertical resolution of the dataset in \n\nquestion. The models that most resemble these observations in terms of the type of BL most \n\nrepresented are NCAR and M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance. Note that the AIRS BLTs are rarely not at the level \n\ncorresponding to 7.S1. BLTs above 700 hPa are also rare with a ~ 4 % occurrence in the deep \n\nconvection area, and an isolated peak of ~ 1 % at 23\u00b0N. At about 0.46 %/hPa, the AIRS \n\ntransect-averaged BLT strength is well below the value for most of the models (the minimum \n\nmodel value is ~ 0.65 %/hPa [M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance]). The seasonal mean BLT height along the cross \n\nsection compares very well with JK10 (apart from a lower sBLT at 35\u00b0N ~ 950 hPa [~ 925 hPa \n\nin JK10]). \n\n \n\n- 101 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n975\n\n950\n\n925\n\n900\n\n875\n\n850\n\nJJA 2003\n\nJJA 2003\n\nB\nLT\n\n p\nre\n\nss\nur\n\ne \n(h\n\nP\na)\n\nlatitude\n\n AIRS\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nAIRS\nB\n\nLT\n s\n\ntre\nng\n\nth\n (%\n\n/h\nP\n\na)\n\nlatitude\n\n AIRS\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nB\nLT\n\n S\n h\n\nis\nt. \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n S1  S2  S3  S4\n\n-1 5 11 17 23 29 35C\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\nAIRS\nB\n\nLT\n v\n\ns.\n 7\n\nS\n1 \n\n(%\n)\n\nlatitude\n\n not7S1\n above700hPa\n\n \nFigure 6.9 - Mean June-July-August (JJA) 2003 boundary layer top (BLT) pressure (top row left plot) and \n\nstrength (top row right plot), together with the sS# Distribution (BLT S hist.) and not7.S1 (BLT vs. 7S1), statistics \ndetermined along GPCI using the sBLT methodology applied to AIRS relative humidity data (see text for details). \n\nTo close the section, and thinking about possible avenues for future applications of sBLT, first \n\nof all, it would be of interest to extend the kind of analysis proposed above to the broader \n\ndomain of the NE Pacific, and even to the global oceanic (sub)tropical regions. Other seasons \n\nshould also be investigated especially for a study of the spatiotemporal behaviour of the sBLT \n\nstatistics. In particular, the sS# Distribution statistic could be used to composite BLT Level and \n\nBLT Strength for each one of the sS#. This compositing approach could also be tried for other \n\nkey parameters such as BL moisture content, proxies for the large-scale dynamics, \n\nenvironmental conditions, cloud behaviour, and cloud-regime transition characteristics. \n\n6.3.3 Cloud cover transitions \n\nAs mentioned, this section revisits the topic of abrupt transitions in cloud cover along the GPCI \n\ntransect. Section 6.3.3.1 introduces a new methodology for the location of discontinuities in the \n\ncloud fields, a follow up of the technique presented in Section 5.1.3 (Sharp gradients), \n\nimplemented constraining the definition of an abrupt cloud cover change. The results for the \n\n- 102 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\ncloud transition statistics (e.g., histograms of their location), are presented in the closing \n\nsection, along with seasonal mean relative humidity profiles spatially averaged upwind and \n\ndownwind of the transition locations determined from JJA 2003 3-hourly model and analysis \n\ndata. \n\n6.3.3.1 An updated version of the analysis of abrupt changes in cloud cover \n\nSince the focus is now exclusively on subtropical cloud transitions, the analysis proposed here \n\nis limited to the segment of the GPCI transect comprised between 14\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N, that is, an \n\narea encompassing solely the ShCu and Sc domains. Recall that the results presented in \n\nSection 5.1.3 were obtained along the whole span of the section, thus including the deep \n\nconvection area and the latitudes south of the ITCZ. \n\nThe new method comprises these steps: (i) determination of the location of the strongest \n\n(greater-than or equal to 30 %) southward decrease in TCC, calculated between two adjacent \n\ntransect locations (as with the previous method, the TCC transition location is assigned to the \n\nposition to the north, among the two adjacent transect locations used to calculate the TCC \n\ndecrease [i.e., the one from where the TCC drops], furthermore, if two or more locations share \n\nthe same strongest TCC decrease value, the one most to the south is chosen); (ii) check if all \n\nthe TCC values to the north of the location determined in (i) (including the TCC value at the \n\ntransition location), are above the average TCC calculated in the domain south of the transition \n\nlocation; (iii) if that is the case, verify if the average TCC for the domain north of the transition \n\nlocation (calculated including the TCC value at the transition location) is above the average \n\nTCC to the south of the transition location by at least 30 %. Only if all these conditions are met \n\na TCC transition is said to occur. This is performed for each one of the TCC records available \n\n3-hourly. Finally, the values for the seasonal mean TCC of the abrupt transition are obtained \n\nfor the extreme north and south locations in the transect, respectively, from the means of all the \n\nTCC averages obtained for the north of and south sides of the transition locations. The mean \n\nlocation of the transition, is the mean of all the locations found in the 3-hourly data. \n\nHistograms of the transition location are computed as well. \n\nThat said, it is now clear that the mean TCC difference between the north and south domains \n\nwill always be at least 30 %. This wasn\u2019t the case for the \u201cold\u201d method (Section 5.1.3), that \n\ncould, potentially, result in a TCC difference between the two domains lower than the \n\nthreshold used to identify the abrupt decrease in TCC, or even in a mean south-side TCC \n\naverage higher than the mean north-side TCC average. \n\n- 103 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n6.3.3.2 Relative humidity signature of sharp gradients in cloud cover \n\nContemporaneous with the calculation of the TCC averages for the north of and south sides of \n\nthe transition locations found following the method described in the previous section, was the \n\nevaluation, for each one of the 3-hourly records with a TCC transition determined, of the \n\nrespective spatially-averaged profiles of relative humidity. Figure 6.10 shows the JJA 2003 \n\nseasonal results for both the TCC transitions (occurrence, mean location, mean north and south \n\nTCC averages, and histograms of transition location) and the corresponding mean RH profiles \n\nfor the north and south sides of the abrupt southward decreases in the TCC parameter. \n\nStarting with the seasonal occurrence of abrupt TCC changes, it is evident that the values are, \n\nfor the new method, and for all the datasets, much lower than those obtained previously, shown \n\nin Fig. 5.4 (for JJA 1998). This is the case, even taking into account only the transect segment \n\nbetween 14\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N. The occurrence values drop from above 90 % to values typically \n\nbelow 25 %, and indication of the robustness of the new method in constraining the model \n\nresults to the situations with a spatially consistent cloud-regime transition. The UKMO model \n\nstands out from the rest with a an occurrence value of ~ 64 %, a feature probably associated \n\nwith the peculiarity of its boundary layer cloud parameterization (see the discussion in Section \n\n5.1.2). The histograms of the transition location are quite different among these datasets, with \n\nthe main peaks found either close to 14\u00b0N, or at 35\u00b0N. The mean location for the transition \n\nfalls between ~ 23\u00b0N (NCAR) and ~ 29\u00b0N (ECMWFan). The seasonal mean value of the TCC \n\nto the north of the transition locations found during the season is typically above 80 % (~ 100 \n\n% in GFDL), while the value to the south is ~ 40 % (below 30 % for BMRC and UKMO). \n\nRegarding the RH profiles, these can be seen as representing the typical Sc (North) and ShCu \n\n(South) RH profiles, at least, for these sharp decreases in TCC. As expected, the ShCu show a \n\ndeeper BL, with mean (vertically-averaged) BL RHs as high as, or even above, those found in \n\nthe Sc BL. Close to the surface, both cloud regimes have similar RH values, with the \n\nmaximum at the surface for the Sc, while for the ShCu the BL peak RH is above the surface, \n\nsomewhere between 960 hPa and 920 hPa. It is above ~ 600 hPa that the biggest differences \n\nare found among the models in the comparison between the respective ShCu and Sc RH \n\nprofiles. Between ~ 600 hPa and ~ 250 hPa, overall similar ShCu and Sc RH profiles are seen \n\nfor ECMWFan, UKMO, and NCAR; consistently lower Sc RH characterizes ECMWF; and \n\nsubstantially higher Sc RH is found in the BMRC, and M\u00e9t\u00e9oFrance models. The highest \n\noverall similarity between the Sc and ShCu RH profiles is found in the ECMWF and \n\n- 104 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\nECMWFan datasets, which are also similar in the TCC transition statistics, except in terms of \n\noccurrence (ECMWF ~ 37 %, ECMWFan ~ 24 %). \n\nThis kind of investigation on the potential impacts of the tropospheric humidity structure on \n\nthe (sub)tropical cloud regime transitions seems necessary to better constrain the models\u2019 \n\nboundary layer cloud behaviour. While there is the need for more observational insight on this \n\n(e.g., Sandu et al. 2010), extending the approach proposed above to analyze numerical \n\nsimulations seems timely. A number of ideas in that direction conclude this section and \n\nchapter, namely: 1) find, additionally, the seasonal means of the RH profiles at the transition \n\nlocation, and just south of it, instead of averaging all the RH profiles in the domains to the \n\nnorth and to the south of the transitions; 2) perform these two types of analysis [in Fig. 6.10 \n\nand proposed in point 1)] individually for each location along the cross section, as a way to \n\ninfer (for each model) any variations in how the Sc and ShCu RH profiles compare when the \n\ntransitions occur later (more to the south) or earlier (more to the north) along the transect (the \n\nmodels should then be intercompared in this respect); 3) add to all these investigations, \n\ninformation on important parameters, such as, sea surface temperature, low tropospheric \n\nstability, proxies for the large-scale dynamics, low level winds, among others; 4) also, a \n\ncomparison between the seasonal mean RH field for the 14\u00b0N-to-35\u00b0N segment of the GPCI \n\ncross section, and the mean RH fields for the same segment, composited separately for those \n\ntimes when the TCC transition falls in specific transect locations, could be tried (this would \n\nallow a broader view of the RH field, as opposed to looking at individual RH profiles). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n- 105 - \n\n\n\n-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - \n\n \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n S\nou\n\nth\n N\n\nor\nth\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\nBMRC     RH (%)  \n\n S\nou\n\nth\n N\n\nor\nth\n\n14 20 26 32\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\njja03 occ.=24.6%\n\n   \n to\n\nta\nl c\n\nlo\nud\n\n c\nov\n\ner\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nBMRC    latitude   \n\n h\nis\n\nto\ngr\n\n.(\n%\n\n)\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n S\nou\n\nth\n N\n\nor\nth\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\nECMWF  RH (%) \n14 20 26 32\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100 jja03 occ.=37.2%\n\n h\nis\n\nto\ngr\n\n.(\n%\n\n)\n\n   \n to\n\nta\nl c\n\nlo\nud\n\n c\nov\n\ner\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nECMWF  latitude \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\nGFDL     RH (%)  \n14 20 26 32\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\njja\n03\n\n o\ncc\n\n.=\n21\n\n.5\n%\n\n h\nis\n\nto\ngr\n\n.(\n%\n\n)\n\n   \n to\n\nta\nl c\n\nlo\nud\n\n c\nov\n\ner\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nGFDL    latitude   \n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n S\nou\n\nth\n N\n\nor\nth\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n  JAMSTEC RH (%)\n14 20 26 32\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\njja\n03\n\n o\ncc\n\n.=\n25\n\n.4\n%\n\n h\nis\n\nto\ngr\n\n.(\n%\n\n)\n\n   \n to\n\nta\nl c\n\nlo\nud\n\n c\nov\n\ner\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n  JAMSTEC latitude\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n S\nou\n\nth\n N\n\nor\nth\n\npr\nes\n\nsu\nre\n\n (\nhP\n\na)\n\n  M\u00e9t\u00e9oFran.

As mentioned in \n\nChapter 3 (The GPCI project), GPCI can be seen as a follow-up of the EUROCS (European \n\nCloud Systems Study) climate model intercomparison, most notably in the much higher (3-\n\nhourly) temporal resolution of the requested model output and observational datasets. The 3-\n\nhourly model and satellite data have proven crucial in the characterization of the regional \n\nclimatology of clouds, boundary layer, and large-scale dynamics and environmental \n\nconditions, done in previous chapters resorting to a number of traditional approaches and new \n\nmethodologies, not possible with lower temporal resolution datasets (e.g., the cloud transition \n\nanalysis, or the boundary layer statistics). In this chapter the focus is more specifically on the \n\ndiurnal cycle, as seen in seasonal means at different locations along the GPCI cross section. \n\nBecause, in the (sub)tropical NE Pacific the diurnal cycle presents its peak amplitude during \n\nthe summertime, the data available for June-July-August (JJA) should prove useful for the \n\npreliminary evaluation of models and observations proposed in the next sections. \n\n7.1 Seasonal mean characteristics \n\n7.1.1 Atmospheric circulation \n\nIn an attempt to characterize mean diurnal changes in the large-scale dynamics associated with \n\nthe Hadley circulation in the NE Pacific, models and reanalysis (ERA-40 [ECMWF 40 Year \n\nRe-analysis]) data for vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700), and 1000 hPa -to- 850 hPa vertically \n\naveraged horizontal wind direction (defined as to where the wind is blowing to, and reported in \n\ndegrees clockwise from North) and speed, were obtained for JJA 1998 at 8 different times \n\nduring the day, for each one of the 13 locations along GPCI. The corresponding mean results, \n\npresented in Fig. 7.1, show: a discernible diurnal cycle of w700 in the ITCZ (Inter-Tropical \n\nConvergence Zone, 8\u00b0N), in ERA-40, and in the ECMWF and NCAR models, with minimum \n\nvalues between 6 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) and 9 UTC (approximately between 7 \n\npm and 10 pm, local solar time [LST]); a relative minimum in subsidence in the trades and \n\nsubtropics (to the north of ~ 17\u00b0N) between 9 UTC and 15 UTC (at 26\u00b0N, 12 UTC ~ 3 am \n\nLST) in ECMWF and NCAR (3 hours earlier in GFDL); practically imperceptible diurnal \n\n- 107 - \n\n\n\n-    Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations    - \n\ncycle in UKMO at any of the locations in the transect; an overall tendency for the trade winds \n\n(17\u00b0N to 23\u00b0N) to blow slightly more to the south between 3 UTC and 9 UTC (between ~ 5:30 \n\npm and ~ 11:30 pm LST, at 20\u00b0N); also the period of the day when the winds are stronger \n\ngenerally to the north of 11\u00b0N (e.g., ERA-40). \n\n   ECMWF w700 (Pa/s)    GFDL w700 (Pa/s)    NCAR w700 (Pa/s)    UKMO w700 (Pa/s)    ERA40 w700 (Pa/s)\n\n \n\nFigure 7.1 - For four of the participating models and ERA-40 reanalysis, June-July-August 1998 mean diurnal \ncycle of vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700, top row), and horizontal wind direction (to where the wind is blowing \nto, in degrees clockwise from North, mid row) and speed (bottom row) vertically averaged in the 1000 hPa to 850 \nhPa layer, all at each one of the 13 locations along GPCI, and for 8 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) 3-hourly \n\nduring the day. \n\n7.1.2 Full-profile parameters \n\nThe JJA 1998 mean diurnal cycle for three vertically distributed cloud-related variables is \n\npresented in Fig. 7.2, Fig. 7.3, and Fig. 7.4, for four participating models and ERA-40 \n\nreanalysis, and at three different locations in the GPCI cross section, respectively, the ITCZ \n\n(8\u00b0N), the shallow cumulus area (ShCu, 20\u00b0N), and the stratocumulus area (Sc, 32\u00b0N).

No specific relation is perceptible in ECMWF and GFDL \n\nbetween the diurnal variations of RH and CF. This is not the case in UKMO and ERA-40, that \n\nshow a positive correlation between the two, with a peak in CF around 15 UTC. In NCAR, the \n\nmaximum in CF between 6 UTC and 9 UTC happens ~ 3 hours earlier than a slight moistening \n\nof the lowest levels in the boundary layer. For the ShCu there is in all datasets a good \n\nagreement between CF and CLW, a situation still valid in the Sc areas. \n\nFinally, the Sc results for NCAR show that the slight increase in RH close to the top of the \n\nboundary layer, between 12 UTC and 18 UTC, is accompanied by higher CF values, especially \n\nat the levels just above a very shallow boundary layer CF maximum. Also, the upper CF \n\nmaximum happens ~ 3 hours later than the low-level maximum in CF. Note, however, that \n\nmost CF simulated above 900 hPa doesn't have any CLW. \n\n7.1.3 Diurnal anomalies from single-level variables \n\nJJA 1998 mean diurnal cycle anomalies are analyzed in this section obtained from model \n\nsimulations, ERA-40 reanalysis, and observations from ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud \n\nClimatology Project) and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission). The results are given \n\nfor three locations in the GPCI cross section, namely, one in the ITCZ (8\u00b0N), one in the ShCu \n\narea (20\u00b0N), and one in the Sc area (32\u00b0N). Three variables were chosen for analysis: low \n\ntropospheric stability (LTS), total cloud cover (TCC), and precipitation (P). The results are \n\npresented in Fig. 7.5. \n\nBriefly, the precipitation observations used here, were extracted from the TRMM 3B42 \n\nprecipitation rate product (Huffman et al. 2007), a 3-hourly, 0.25\u00b0 \u00d7 0.25\u00b0, global (50\u00b0S to \n\n50\u00b0N) dataset, covering the period from December 1997 to the present. 3B42 is obtained at \n\nfine intervals with the TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) combining \n\nmicrowave sensor precipitation estimates. Where unavailable, those estimates are substituted \n\nby infrared (IR) estimates from geostationary IR observations. These data are available online \n\nat the Goddard Earth Sciences Data &amp; Information Service Center (GES-DISC). \n\nThe LTS variable (defined as the difference between the potential temperature at 700 hPa and \n\nat the surface), shows for all models and at any of the three locations along the GPCI transect, \n\nvery similar mean diurnal variation behaviour, both in terms of amplitude and phase, with daily \n\nmaxima typically found between 3 UTC and 6 UTC, and minima between 15 UTC and 21 \n\n- 111 - \n\n\n\n-    Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations    - \n\nUTC in the ITCZ, and 3 hours (UTC) earlier in the ShCu and Sc areas. ECMWF is the model \n\nwith the least diurnal amplitude in the ITCZ, while showing in the other two regions, similar \n\nvalues as compared to the other datasets. The GFDL model shows, in all regions, the maximum \n\nand minimum LTS values shifted 3 hours earlier from the rest. No other variable shows this \n\noverall high degree of (intra-, and inter-model) diurnal coherence between the various regions. \n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nLT\nS\n\n (K\n)\n\nITCZ         UTC                 \n\n ECMWF\n GFDL\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nLT\nS\n\n (K\n)\n\nShCu         UTC                 \n\n NCAR\n UKMO\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nLT\nS\n\n (K\n)\n\nSc              UTC                \n\n ERA40\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\nT\nC\n\nC\n (%\n\n)\n\nITCZ         UTC                 \n\n ISCCP\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n\nT\nC\n\nC\n (%\n\n)\n\nShCu         UTC                 \n\n ISCCP\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n\nT\nC\n\nC\n (%\n\n)\n\nSc              UTC                \n\n ISCCP\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nP\n (m\n\nm\n/d\n\nay\n)\n\nITCZ         UTC                 \n\n TRMM\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nP\n (m\n\nm\n/d\n\nay\n)\n\nShCu         UTC                 \n\n TRMM\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n\nP\n (m\n\nm\n/d\n\nay\n)\n\nSc              UTC                \n\n TRMM\n\n \n\nFigure 7.5 - For four of the participating models, ERA-40 reanalysis, ISCCP observations, and TRMM estimates, \nJune-July-August 1998 mean diurnal cycle anomalies of low tropospheric stability (LTS), total cloud cover \n\n(TCC), and precipitation (P), obtained in three different areas along GPCI (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone \n[ITCZ, 8\u00b0N], shallow cumulus [ShCu, 20\u00b0N], stratocumulus [Sc, 32\u00b0N]), and for 8 UTC (Universal Time \n\nCoordinated) 3-hourly during the day. \n\nISCCP's TCC in the ITCZ shows two relative maxima, the most pronounced being the one at 3 \n\nUTC (~ 4 pm LST), and a secondary one at 18 UTC (~ 7 am LST).

In the ShCu and Sc areas the \n\ngeneral tendency is for a single TCC cycle. ISCCP shows in the ShCu the biggest diurnal \n\namplitude in TCC.

It is in the \n\nSc that ISCCP has the least diurnal variation in TCC, with models showing larger values in this \n\nrespect (particularly GFDL with a diurnal amplitude as large as in the ShCu). Overall, there is, \n\nin the Sc, a better agreement between the datasets in the location of the daily maximum in \n\nTCC: 18 UTC (~ 9:30 am LST) in ISCCP, and ECMWF; 21 UTC (~ 12:30 pm LST) in ERA-\n\n40; and between 12 UTC (~ 3:30 am LST) and 15 UTC (~ 6:30 am LST) in UKMO, NCAR, \n\nand GFDL. \n\nIn terms of precipitation rate (ECMWF is not shown), most datasets show a (single) diurnal \n\npeak sometime between 12 UTC and 18 UTC at any of the three locations along the transect \n\n(about 3 hours earlier in the ShCu and Sc for GFDL). In the ITCZ, all datasets lack in diurnal \n\namplitude as compared to TRMM, and, except for NCAR, are not in phase with the \n\nobservations, showing the peak precipitation 3 hours earlier than TRMM. In general, the \n\ndatasets are more in phase with TRMM in the Sc, although showing higher diurnal amplitudes. \n\nIn the ShCu, TRMM has a principal peak t 21 UTC, and a secondary one between 12 UTC and \n\n15 UTC. No other dataset has more than one precipitation peak in the ShCu (or at any of the \n\nother positions). \n\nA final note about the Sc results, to highlight that, except between 0 UTC (~ 3:30 pm LST) and \n\n6 UTC (~ 9:30 pm LST) for UKMO and NCAR, the diurnal evolution in TCC is basically out \n\nof phase with the diurnal variation in LTS. In fact, the peak TCC is found at a time close to the \n\nlowest diurnal value of LTS in practically all models and ERA-40. Assuming that TCC in the \n\nSc is essentially associated with low level (boundary layer) stratiform cloudiness (see the cloud \n\nfraction results in Fig. 7.4), and looking more specifically at the NCAR results, a model that (at \n\nleast in this version) is known to link this type of subtropical clouds to LTS (see the discussion \n\nin Section 5.1.2), it could be inferred that the Sc response to LTS is dependent, not only on the \n\ntime of the day, but also (or perhaps, above all) on the (in this case) TCC value, that is, the \n\n(positive) cloud response to LTS is most effective for the lowest TCC values in the diurnal \n\ncycle (at 0 UTC in NCAR). Then, once the (increasing) cloud amount reaches a certain \n\nthreshold (at 6 UTC in NCAR) the Sc become less sensitive to (the decreasing) static stability \n\nof the environment (that, for NCAR, happens between 6 UTC and 15 UTC), showing what \n\ncould be called \u201cScinertia\u201d (for \u201cstratocumulus inertia\u201d), i.e., a certain degree of inertia in the \n\nresponse to LTS (as mentioned, the TCC maximum in the Sc happens, for NCAR, between ~ \n\n- 113 - \n\n\n\n-    Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations    - \n\n3:30 am and ~ 6:30 am, LST, the later being the time when LTS is at its minimum). Naturally, \n\nother parameters should be taken into consideration in this type of analysis (e.g., to what \n\ndegree \u201cScinertia\u201d is related to the humidity structure of the free/mid troposphere?). Answers \n\nto some of these questions should be found in high spatiotemporal resolution observational and \n\nmodelling efforts targeted at the subtropical Sc regime. \n\nIt is apparent that models differ from each other, and from ERA-40, ISCCP, and TRMM, \n\nmostly in TCC and precipitation, and particularly in the deep convection and trade wind \n\nregions. Given that there is an indication (both observational and modelling) that diurnal-scale \n\nprocesses can have an impact on phenomena occurring on longer time scales, these \n\ndiscrepancies should be given more attention by the climate prediction community, especially \n\nbeing the diurnal cycle the most distinct (forced) mode of variability in the atmosphere.\n\n- 114 - \n\n\n\n-    Summary and conclusions    - \n\n8 Summary and conclusions \n\nNotwithstanding the considerable improvement in cloud parameterization in the last 20 years, \n\nthe representation of clouds is still a challenge for the weather and climate modelling \n\ncommunities. The urgency for the development of cloud parameterization in GCMs (General \n\nCirculation Models) is reinforced by the fact that the amount of cloud generated by the models \n\nhas a significant impact on the predicted behaviour of the climate system. In particular, current \n\nclimate models tend to respond differently in climate change sensitivity experiments. \n\nParameterization deficiencies also result in thermodynamically inconsistent representation of \n\nthe hydrologic cycle., with important implications in the simulation of the (sub)tropical \n\natmospheric circulation. These topics are investigated by different GCSS (Global energy and \n\nwater cycle experiment Cloud System Study) working groups, whose strategy has been \n\nsuccessful in defining and understanding fundamental cloud regimes, and in developing, and \n\nimproving cloud parameterizations. However, the exclusive use of one-dimensional versions of \n\natmospheric models, as traditionally done in GCSS, does not allow a deep understanding of the \n\nfundamental role of clouds in climate, which implies that parameterization testing has to be \n\ndone in the complete (3D) GCMs, a task that potentially entails the analysis of very large \n\namounts of model simulation data. \n\nIn this context, the GPCI (GCSS / working group on numerical experimentation Pacific Cross-\n\nsection Intercomparison) project offers a new and much lighter approach for the \n\nintercomparison of GCMs, by focusing the analysis on a reduced number of locations along a \n\ncross section, allowing for a relatively straightforward model and observational data \n\nintegration. GPCI has been focused on the (sub)tropical NE Pacific ocean, and developed a \n\nframework specifically targeted at the investigation of fundamental cloud regimes that \n\ntypically occur over the eastern boundaries of the (sub)tropical oceans, namely, stratocumulus, \n\nshallow cumulus, deep cumulus, and the transitions between them. Knowledge gained from a \n\ndetailed analysis of the behaviour of these cloud systems, and associated dynamical and \n\nthermodynamical environments, in high temporal resolution data from weather and climate \n\nprediction models and from observations, should offer insight for the improvement and \n\ndevelopment of new parameterizations of clouds, boundary layer, and convection. Having been \n\ndeveloped in tight connection with the GPCI project, the investigation presented in this thesis \n\nwas oriented along the lines of GPCI\u2019s main goals and scientific questions. \n\n- 115 - \n\n\n\n-    Summary and conclusions    - \n\nGPCI can be seen as a level-2 model intercomparison project, in which all the participating \n\nmodels have to follow the same line of predefined project specifications and protocols. The \n\nbasic condition imposed is that models run in climate mode and using prescribed sea surface \n\ntemperatures as boundary condition. The period of interest is the June-July-August (JJA) \n\nseason. The focus geographical domain ranges from -5\u00baN to 45\u00baN and 160\u00baE to 240\u00baE, and \n\nencompasses 13 locations along the a cross section. The simulation results were requested in a \n\n3-hourly temporal resolution for a number of variables, either as vertical profiles, or single-\n\nlevel variables. Over twenty weather and climate prediction organizations have joined the \n\neffort, and an extensive amount of satellite data has been prepared for GPCI. Analysis of \n\nmodel and reanalysis data suggest that it is possible to study the main features associated with \n\nthe cloud phenomenology resorting only to an individual cross section aligned with the \n\natmospheric circulation associated with the regional thermally-direct Hadley cell. \n\nA preliminary analysis of GPCI model and observational data, with the goal to give an \n\noverview of the mean characteristics of the summertime atmospheric hydrologic cycle in the \n\n(sub)tropical NE Pacific, has been performed with an emphasis on the vertical distribution of \n\nclouds, and on processes involving dynamical and environmental factors that play a role in the \n\nmaintenance of total and low cloud fields on a seasonal time scale. The seasonal mean results \n\nfor most variables (e.g., total cloud cover, liquid water path, and outgoing longwave radiation) \n\ntend to be characterized by a high degree of scatter among the simulations, with models rarely \n\nshowing good agreement with the observations in all of the transect locations. Mean profiles of \n\nvertical velocity, and relative humidity, suggest that the basic features associated with the \n\nregional Hadley circulation are, overall, well represented, though, in detail, substantial \n\ndifferences exist between the models (e.g., in the strength of the deep convection, or humidity \n\ncontent in the boundary layer). A comparison of the vertical distribution of cloud fraction \n\nhighlighted the challenges in the parameterization and simulation of clouds in climate models, \n\nwith simulations showing a variety of behaviours in the representation of the different cloud \n\ntypes (e.g., too low stratocumulus clouds) and transitions between them (e.g., presence of \n\ndistinct cloud layers in the transition areas), these results were validated against observations of \n\ncloud occurrence from the CloudSat and CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared \n\nPathfinder Satellite Observations) satellites. Process-oriented studies indicate, overall, a \n\nnoticeable response of the large-scale circulation to change in the prescribed sea surface \n\ntemperatures in all of the models. The responses of other variables such as net shortwave \n\nradiation at the top of the atmosphere, and total cloud cover, are even more striking, and vary \n\n- 116 - \n\n\n\n-    Summary and conclusions    - \n\nfrom model to model. The fact that the general response to the increase in sea surface \n\ntemperature is not always coherent among the different variables for a given model, points out \n\nto the need to better constrain the simulated behaviour of important cloud-related parameters, \n\nincluding those crucial for the evaluation of cloud radiative forcing. No obvious relation \n\nbetween low clouds in the stratocumulus and shallow cumulus regimes, and subsidence and sea \n\nsurface temperature (or low tropospheric stability) has been found in 3-hourly model data for \n\nthe JJA 1998 season. \n\nAn in-depth analysis of convective regime transition, based on the spatiotemporal behaviour of \n\nclouds, was performed resorting to cloud data from model simulations, atmospheric reanalysis, \n\nand satellite observations. To gain insight into the question of the transition in (sub)tropical \n\ncloud regimes, several techniques were developed to detect the transitions, and or summarize \n\ntheir main seasonal features. Probability density functions of total cloud cover along the GPCI \n\ntransect, obtained from JJA 1998 3-hourly data, are different for the various models, presenting \n\nimportant departures even in locations where the models show practically the same mean total \n\ncloud cover. Two very distinct stratocumulus -to- shallow cumulus transitions could be \n\nidentified (a relatively smooth southward evolution, and a more abrupt one with a bimodal \n\ncharacter) and associated with two distinct parameterization approaches. None of the two \n\nmodel behaviours (or parameterizations) reproduces well the observed pattern seen in \n\ncorresponding ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) observations. Cloud \n\ncover statistics from a methodology based on the identification of large gradients of total cloud \n\ncover along the cross section show a diversity of behaviours among the models, for instance, in \n\nthe mean cloud cover decrease, in their seasonal frequency of occurrence, or in the histograms \n\nof the location of the transition (ISCCP and reanalysis differ as well). Additionally, a \n\npreliminary spectral analysis of the seasonal record of spatial shifts in the location of these \n\nsharp gradients in cloud cover was performed. No outstanding peaks were found in the \n\ncorresponding spectra, being the differences in the temporal evolution of the underlying record \n\nwhat mostly distinguished the models (e.g., the tendency for the abrupt transitions to occur \n\nmore to the north of the transect toward the end of the JJA season, or the small amplitude in the \n\nlocation change). In terms of the evolution of clout-top height along the section, the model \n\nensemble compared well with the analysis product used, though, especially south of the \n\nstratocumulus areas, all results departed from corresponding MISR (Multiangle Imaging \n\nSpectroradiometer) observations. Still in the context of cloud regime transition, a grade-based \n\napproach to clustering of spatial patterns was introduced (GEPAT [Grade-based Empirical \n\n- 117 - \n\n\n\n-    Summary and conclusions    - \n\nPattern Analysis Technique]), and subsequently applied to total cloud cover along the cross \n\nsection, with the final goal to indentify main spatiotemporal features of the seasonal cloud \n\ncover, and compare associated environmental conditions. Six different cloud-field patterns for \n\nJJA 1998, with different seasonal representativeness, were analyzed in terms of the respective \n\nmeans of vertical velocity at 700 hPa, liquid water path, sea surface temperature, low \n\ntropospheric stability, and wind direction and speed. Noteworthy differences were found \n\nmostly in the characteristics of the vertical velocity, and liquid water path fields. A few ideas \n\nfor a future application of the technique include: the analysis of other seasons and years \n\n(separately or in combination); a comparison of results for different regions; and a more direct \n\nuse of purely observational data. \n\nThe humidity structure in the GPCI region was given special attention, with the goal to better \n\nunderstand its role as one of the main parameters in the context of the hydrologic cycle, \n\nparticularly through its influence on cloud formation and evolution. State-of-the-art satellite \n\nobservations from AIRS (Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder) were analyzed along the cross \n\nsection, together with model simulations and atmospheric analyses. A number of results, based \n\non the treatment of relative humidity data for the summer season, were analyzed, namely, \n\nseasonal mean profiles, variance, and temporal evolution. The comparison with the AIRS \n\nseasonal mean relative humidity showed significant biases in the models (e.g., important \n\nnegative bias in the lowest portion of the boundary layer, a positive bias in the tropopause \n\nlayer, and a generally drier subtropical mid troposphere). In terms of standard deviation, \n\nalthough models show, overall, higher relative humidity variability, there is a lack of \n\nvariability in the boundary layer along the entire cross section. A positive bias just above the \n\nboundary layer north of the trades, is argued to be probably associated with the relatively poor \n\nvertical resolution of the AIRS dataset used (more so than a model deficiency). The temporal \n\nevolution of the vertical distribution of relative humidity seems to point out to the need to \n\ninclude in the investigation of the stratocumulus \u2013to- shallow cumulus transition, the influence, \n\nnot just of the humidity structure in the free troposphere immediately above the boundary \n\nlayer, but also of the humidity profile all the way to the upper troposphere. Regarding, more \n\nspecifically, the humidity structure of the lower troposphere, a new methodology for the \n\ndetermination of the top of the maritime boundary layer was introduced (sBLT [sequential \n\nBoundary-Layer-Top determination scheme]). The results seem promising, especially for its \n\nbroad applicability, and given that it permits a characterization of the boundary layer (top) not \n\noffered in other such methodologies. Seasonal mean boundary-layer-top height and strength \n\n- 118 - \n\n\n\n-    Summary and conclusions    - \n\nwere analyzed for models and analysis along the GPCI cross section, showing considerable \n\nspread, except in the (practically common) rate of southward deepening of the boundary layer. \n\nThe deep convection and the stratocumulus areas, present, respectively, the least, and the most \n\nwell defined boundary layer tops. Following the sBLT classification, different seasonal \n\ndistributions of the representativeness of the main boundary layer types, were found among \n\nmodels and for different locations along the transect. In this respect, only two of the models \n\ncompared well with AIRS. An updated version of the technique to detect abrupt spatial \n\nchanges in the cloud fields along the cross section was developed. It seemed more robust in \n\nconstraining the model results to the situations with a spatially consistent cloud-regime \n\ntransition. Much lower occurrence of the transitions was reported with the new technique, with \n\nbig differences among the models (unlike the corresponding results for the previous version of \n\nthe technique). It allowed for a better understanding of the impact of distinct cloud \n\nparameterization approaches on regime transition behaviour. Finally, relative humidity profiles \n\ncomposited for the two cloud regimes separated by the transition locations identified, showed \n\nmarked differences between the two regimes for a given model, with the biggest differences \n\namong the models, found in the mid and upper troposphere. Concrete ways to extend the \n\ninvestigation of the potential impacts of the tropospheric humidity structure on the \n\n(sub)tropical cloud regime transitions were proposed. \n\nAs one of the main topics in GPCI, the representation, in weather and climate prediction \n\nmodels, of the diurnal variation of clouds and cloud-related parameters, was analyzed resorting \n\nto 3-hourly model output and observational data. The seasonal mean diurnal cycle was \n\ncharacterized for different locations along the GPCI transect. Results were presented for: \n\natmospheric circulation associated with the large-scale dynamics in the Hadley-cell-dominated \n\nNE Pacific; a number of cloud-related vertically-distributed variables; and for JJA mean \n\ndiurnal cycle anomalies at three specific locations in the cross section, representative of the \n\nmain cloud/convection regimes found in the region. A discernible diurnal cycle of vertical \n\nvelocity at 700 hPa could be identified in the inter-tropical convergence zone in reanalysis \n\ndata, and in some of the models (weaker diurnal variations were also found in the trades and \n\nsubtropics). One of the models showed practically no diurnal variation of this parameter at any \n\nof the locations in the transect. Wind intensity and direction also showed characteristic diurnal \n\nchange. Vertically-distributed relative humidity, cloud fraction, and cloud liquid water content \n\nresults, showed, some diurnal variability in all of the datasets, particularly in the deep \n\nconvection areas and below 600 hPa. Models do not agree in the time of the diurnal maxima of \n\n- 119 - \n\n\n\n-    Summary and conclusions    - \n\nthese variables. Temporal correspondence between cloud fraction and cloud liquid water \n\ncontent is, overall, better constrained in the shallow cumulus and stratocumulus areas than in \n\nthe inter-tropical convergence zone. There is, in the subtropics in one of the models, cloud \n\nfraction reported in the boundary layer without any associated cloud liquid water content. As \n\nfor mean diurnal anomalies of low tropospheric stability, total cloud cover, and precipitation \n\n(with precipitation rate observations from TRMM [Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]), \n\nmodels tend to agree well in the first parameter, but differ from each other and the observations \n\nin the other two (e.g., in the deep convection region ISCCP's total cloud cover shows two \n\nrelative maxima, the most pronounced happening at ~ 4 pm, local solar time, while the other \n\ndatasets tend to have the most pronounced peak in the early morning). In the stratocumulus \n\nISCCP has the least diurnal variation in total cloud cover, being, in this respect, surpassed by \n\nthe models. Overall, there is, in the stratocumulus, a better agreement between the datasets in \n\nthe location of the daily maximum in total cloud cover. Concerning the precipitation rate, most \n\ndatasets show a relatively well defined peak in all of the locations along the transect, but lack \n\nin diurnal amplitude in the deep convection area (as compared to TRMM). Finally, the link \n\nbetween stratocumulus and low tropospheric stability was discussed for a particular model \n\nknown to bind the two, and led to the argument of the existence of a certain degree of \u201cinertia\u201d \n\nin the response of subtropical cloud cover to low tropospheric stability changes during the \n\ndiurnal cycle.  Also, since the (positive) cloud response to the stability of the environment \n\nseemed to be most effective only when total cloud cover was at its lowest values in the diurnal \n\ncycle, a possible dependence of the response on cloud amount was inferred. To what degree \n\n\u201cScinertia\u201d (for \u201cstratocumulus inertia\u201d) would be related to the humidity structure of the \n\nfree/mid troposphere, was a question left for future research. \n\nTo conclude, two points. First, this work shows well how current weather and climate \n\nprediction models still suffer from deficiencies in the representation of clouds and cloud-\n\nrelated processes. Second, the GPCI framework proved useful, in the characterization of main \n\nmodel shortcomings, and in helping envision possible avenues for future investigation, both on \n\nthe modelling side and on the observational front. \n\n- 120 - \n\n\n\n-    References    - \n\n9 References \n\nAckerman, S.

The main goal of GPCI is to evaluate and help\n\n\nunderstand and improve the representation of tropical and subtropical cloud processes in weather and climate\n\n\nprediction models. In this paper, a detailed analysis of cloud regime transitions along the cross section from\n\n\nthe subtropics to the tropics for the season June\u2013July\u2013August of 1998 is presented. This GPCI study confirms\n\n\nmany of the typical weather and climate prediction model problems in the representation of clouds: un-\n\n\nderestimation of clouds in the stratocumulus regime by most models with the corresponding consequences in\n\n\nterms of shortwave radiation biases; overestimation of clouds by the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) in\n\n\nthe deep tropics (in particular) with the corresponding impact in the outgoing longwave radiation; large\n\n\nspread between the different models in terms of cloud cover, liquid water path and shortwave radiation;\n\n\nsignificant differences between the models in terms of vertical cross sections of cloud properties (in partic-\n\n\nular), vertical velocity, and relative humidity. An alternative analysis of cloud cover mean statistics is pro-\n\n\nposed where sharp gradients in cloud cover along the GPCI transect are taken into account. This analysis\n\n\nshows that the negative cloud bias of some models and ERA-40 in the stratocumulus regions [as compared to\n\n\nthe first International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP)] is associated not only with lower values of\n\n\ncloud cover in these regimes, but also with a stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition that occurs too early along\n\n\nthe trade wind Lagrangian trajectory. Histograms of cloud cover along the cross section differ significantly\n\n\nbetween models. Some models exhibit a quasi-bimodal structure with cloud cover being either very large\n\n\n(close to 100%) or very small, while other models show a more continuous transition. The ISCCP observa-\n\n\ntions suggest that reality is in-between these two extreme examples. These different patterns reflect the di-\n\n\nverse nature of the cloud, boundary layer, and convection parameterizations in the participating weather and\n\n\nclimate prediction models.\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\nBy the end of World War II there were 22 weather\n\n\nships stationed in the Atlantic Ocean and 24 in the Pa-\n\n\ncific Ocean.1 From July to October 1945, three weather\n\n\nships were stationed in a Pacific transect from San Fran-\n\n\ncisco to Honolulu and were able to sample in a fairly\n\n\ncontinuous manner the weather conditions in a region\n\n\nwhere important climatic cloud transitions occur from\n\n\nstratocumulus regimes (off the coast of California) to\n\n\ncumulus regimes close to Hawaii. The observations col-\n\n\nlected by these ships along this Pacific Ocean transect\n\n\nallowed, for the first time, construction of a detailed view\n\n\nof the three-dimensional structure of this key subtropical\n\n\nboundary layer transition as the atmosphere is advected\n\n\nover warmer waters (and lower subsidence) along the\n\n\ntrade winds (Riehl et al. 1951).\n\n\nAlong similar transects, the stratocumulus cloud decks,\n\n\nwhich typically overlay the cold waters off the west coast\n\n\nof continents, transition to shallow cumulus topped\n\n\nboundary layers (e.g., Albrecht et al. 1995; Bretherton\n\n\net al. 1999) and then eventually to deep cumulus con-\n\n\nvection over the warmer waters of the intertropical\n\n\nconvergence zone. The cloud regimes, associated with\n\n\nthe boundary layer, deep convection, and the transitions\n\n\nbetween them, play a significant role in modulating the\n\n\ntropical and subtropical atmospheric circulation and are\n\n\nknown to have a profound influence on the physics and\n\n\ndynamics of climate (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; Ma et al.\n\n\n1996; Larson et al. 1999). In climate change sensitivity\n\n\nexperiments (e.g., doubling CO2), current climate models\n\n\ndisplay profoundly different responses in terms of\n\n\nboundary layer (low) clouds, often leading to cloud\u2013\n\n\nclimate feedbacks of opposing signal (e.g., Bony et al.\n\n\n2004, 2006; Bony and Dufresne 2005; Wyant et al. 2006;\n\n\nStephens 2005). It is tenable that changes in the charac-\n\n\nteristics of the stratocumulus to cumulus transition play\n\n\nan important role in cloud\u2013climate feedbacks.\n\n\nUnfortunately, many of the important characteristics\n\n\nof these cloud regimes are not realistically represented\n\n\nin weather and climate prediction models (e.g., Jakob\n\n\n1999; Duynkerke and Teixeira 2001; Siebesma et al.\n\n\n2004). This is in spite of some promising advances in the\n\n\ndevelopment of cloud and cloudy boundary layer pa-\n\n\nrameterizations during the last several years (e.g.,\n\n\nTiedtke 1993; Del Genio et al. 1996; Fowler et al. 1996;\n\n\nRasch and Kristja?nsson 1998; Lock et al. 2000; Lock 2001;\n\n\nBony and Emanuel 2001; Teixeira and Hogan 2002;\n\n\nTompkins 2002).\n\n\nThe need to better understand the physics and dy-\n\n\nnamics of clouds and to improve the parameterizations\n\n\nof clouds and cloud-related processes in weather and\n\n\nclimate prediction models led to the creation of the\n\n\n1 After the war 13 weather ships remained in the Atlantic and\n\n\nPacific until 1980.\n\n\n5224 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)\n\n\nCloud Systems Study (GCSS) in the early 1990s (Browning\n\n\net al. 1993; Randall et al. 2003). The research efforts in\n\n\nGCSS have been divided into different cloud types\n\n\n(boundary layer clouds, cirrus, frontal clouds, deep con-\n\n\nvection, and polar clouds) and have extensively used\n\n\nlarge-eddy simulation (LES) and cloud-resolving models\n\n\n(CRM) to assess and develop parameterizations for single-\n\n\ncolumn models (SCM), which are one-dimensional ver-\n\n\nsions of weather and climate prediction models.\n\n\nThe traditional GCSS strategy can be divided in the\n\n\nfollowing steps: (i) create a case study using observations;\n\n\n(ii) evaluate CRM/LES models for the case study; (iii)\n\n\nuse SCMs to evaluate the parameterizations; and (iv) use\n\n\nthe statistics from CRM/LES to develop and improve\n\n\nparameterizations. This strategy has been quite successful\n\n\nin improving CRM/LES models, in helping to define and\n\n\nunderstand fundamental cloud regimes (e.g., Duynkerke\n\n\net al. 1999; Bretherton et al. 1999; Bechtold et al. 2000;\n\n\nRedelsperger et al. 2000; Stevens et al. 2001; Randall et al.\n\n\n2003; Siebesma et al. 2003) and in developing new pa-\n\n\nrameterizations for clouds and the cloudy boundary layer\n\n\n(e.g., Cuijpers and Bechtold 1995; Lock et al. 2000; Golaz\n\n\net al. 2002; Teixeira and Hogan 2002; Cheinet and Teixeira\n\n\n2003; Lenderink and Holtslag 2004; Bretherton et al. 2004;\n\n\nSoares et al. 2004; Bretherton and Park 2009).\n\n\n2. GCSS/WGNE Pacific cross-section\nintercomparison\n\n\na. Introduction\n\n\nDespite its successes, the current GCSS strategy of\n\n\nusing only one-dimensional subsets (SCMs) of weather\n\n\nand climate prediction models falls short of addressing\n\n\nthe fundamental role of clouds in climate since it does not\n\n\nallow for feedback to the large-scale dynamics. The latter\n\n\ncan only be achieved by using fully three-dimensional\n\n\nmodels of the atmosphere. In turn, the analysis of such\n\n\nmodels is notoriously difficult owing to the large amount\n\n\nof information required for meaningful conclusions to be\n\n\ndrawn.\n\n\nIn this paper, a model evaluation strategy is adopted\n\n\nin which weather and climate prediction models are ana-\n\n\nlyzed along a cross section in the Pacific Ocean, from the\n\n\ncoast of California to the equatorial region, as illustrated\n\n\nin Fig. 1. The figure also depicts the low (boundary layer)\n\n\ncloud cover climatology from the International Satellite\n\n\nCloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) (Rossow and Schiffer\n\n\n1999) for the June\u2013July\u2013August (JJA) season. This ap-\n\n\nproach aims at complementing the more traditional ef-\n\n\nforts in GCSS by providing a simple framework for the\n\n\nevaluation of weather and climate prediction models\n\n\nthat encompasses several fundamental cloud regimes,\n\n\nsuch as stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep cu-\n\n\nmulus, as well as the transitions between them. The fact\n\n\nthat data is only needed along a model transect allows for\n\n\na technically less involved intercomparison.\n\n\nThe overall goal is to use the GPCI framework to un-\n\n\nderstand cloud regimes and regime transitions in the\n\n\ntropics and subtropics and to characterize the main de-\n\n\nficiencies in climate models in terms of the representa-\n\n\ntion of clouds and cloud-related processes. These analyses\n\n\nshould lead to the development of new parameteriza-\n\n\ntions of clouds, boundary layer, and convection and con-\n\n\nsequently contribute to more accurate predictions of\n\n\nclimate change. Ultimately, it is the combination of the\n\n\nmodel and the satellite data and the use of new analysis\n\n\ntechniques that will improve our ability to not only es-\n\n\ntablish the model shortcomings but also to gain insight in\n\n\nthe physical reasons leading to these deficiencies.\n\n\nPreliminary studies using a similar cross section across\n\n\nthe Pacific Ocean were performed in the context of a\n\n\nEuropean Cloud Systems Study (EUROCS). While im-\n\n\nportant, the EUROCS results (Siebesma et al. 2004) were\n\n\nlimited due to coarse temporal resolution (only monthly\n\n\nmean values at four different times per day were avail-\n\n\nable) and the absence of some critical observational data\n\n\nsources for the evaluation of the model results, such as\n\n\ninformation about the tropospheric temperature and\n\n\nhumidity structure.\n\n\nAs a summary, the main general motivations for\n\n\nGPCI are\n\n\nd to study important cloud regimes and transitions\u2014\n\n\nstratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep convection;\nd to evaluate models and observations in the tropics and\n\n\nsubtropics in terms of the atmospheric hydrologic\n\n\ncycle;\nd to utilize a new generation of satellite datasets;\nd to help the development of new cloud, convection, and\n\n\nturbulence parameterizations in weather and climate\n\n\nmodels;\n\n\nFIG. 1.

Model data\n\n\nModel output from over 20 weather and climate pre-\n\n\ndiction organizations was collected and organized for\n\n\nGPCI (see appendix A and Tables A1 and A2 therein for\n\n\nmore information). The three-hourly model output from\n\n\nsimulations of the periods of June\u2013July\u2013August 1998 and\n\n\n2003 (only 1998 results are discussed in this paper) is\n\n\nproduced for 13 points along the GPCI transect from\n\n\n358N, 1258W in the northeast to 18S, 1738W in the\n\n\nsouthwest (see appendix B for details on the GPCI\n\n\nspecifications\u2014in particular, the locations of the points).\n\n\nA three-hourly model output frequency permits better\n\n\ncharacterization of the diurnal variability and provides\n\n\nthe opportunity of applying novel model evaluation\n\n\ntechniques. These types of analyses were unavailable\n\n\nduring the EUROCS study (Siebesma et al. 2004) be-\n\n\ncause of the temporally sparse data sampling.\n\n\nc. Satellite data\n\n\nIn the context of GPCI, model results are evaluated\n\n\nagainst a variety of satellite observations. Satellite ob-\n\n\nservations have been for some time a fundamental tool\n\n\nfor our understanding of the role of clouds in the climate\n\n\nsystem (e.g., Ramanathan et al. 1989; Harrison et al. 1990;\n\n\nRossow and Schiffer 1991, 1999; Wielicki et al. 1995;\n\n\nChylek et al. 2007) and for the evaluation of climate and\n\n\nweather prediction models (e.g., Cess et al. 1997; Webb\n\n\net al. 2001; Randall et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2005). The high\n\n\nvertical and temporal resolution of the GPCI model data\n\n\nwill facilitate a more complete utilization of satellite data.\n\n\nA collection of satellite data related to GPCI is avail-\n\n\nable online at the GCSS Data Integration for Model\n\n\nEvaluation (DIME) Web site (http://gcss-dime.giss.nasa.\n\n\ngov/). These datasets include high temporal resolution\n\n\ndata from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology\n\n\nProject (ISCCP) together with daily products from the\n\n\nSpecial Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), the Global\n\n\nPrecipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), and the TIROS\n\n\nOperational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). For more details\n\n\non the satellite data see appendix C. In this manuscript\n\n\nthe potential of the ISCCP data for the study of cloud\n\n\nregime transitions is explored in detail. Note, that when\n\n\nusing the ISCCP simulator (Klein and Jakob 1999; Webb\n\n\net al. 2001) it is often possible to extract more informa-\n\n\ntion from a comparison between models and ISCCP ob-\n\n\nservations. Unfortunately, many of the models used in the\n\n\nGPCI exercise do not have the ISCCP simulator imple-\n\n\nmented. To make this intercomparison as inclusive\n\n\nand simple as possible no ISCCP simulator output was\n\n\nrequested.\n\n\nd. Two-dimensional data\n\n\nIt can be argued that a single cross section may miss\n\n\nkey physical events that occur in a certain region. For ex-\n\n\nample, when analyzing the diurnal cycle over the stra-\n\n\ntocumulus regions, it must be taken into account that\n\n\nsubsidence may be caused by convection somewhere over\n\n\nland, which may not be present in the cross section. To\n\n\ntackle these types of problems without requiring vast\n\n\namounts of three dimensional data, GPCI requested out-\n\n\nput [of only a few variables such as outgoing longwave\n\n\nradiation (OLR) or precipitation, for example] in a two-\n\n\ndimensional region that contains the cross section (58S\u2013\n\n\n458N, 1608E\u20131208W).\n\n\n3. How representative is the GPCI transect?\n\n\nThe first obvious question regarding this study is: how\n\n\nrepresentative is the GPCI transect in the sense of cap-\n\n\nturing the most relevant physical processes of this region\n\n\nof the subtropical and tropical Pacific?\n\n\nIn this section two types of results are shown so as to\n\n\naddress this question. First, the wind direction at 1000\n\n\nand 900 hPa along the GPCI cross section from the 40-yr\n\n\nECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) product (Uppala et al.\n\n\n2005) is analyzed. Figures 2 and 3 show histograms of\n\n\nwind direction at 900 and 1000 hPa, respectively, for six\n\n\npoints along the GPCI transect for June\u2013July\u2013August\n\n\n(JJA) 1998. These figures illustrate how, for (at least) the\n\n\npoints from 88 to 268N (at 1000 hPa), and from 148 to\n\n\n268N (at 900 hPa), the wind direction histograms are\n\n\nreasonably parallel to the GPCI transect. These results\n\n\nconfirm that, at least for ERA-40, the orientation of the\n\n\nGPCI transect is close to the mean boundary-layer trade\n\n\nwind trajectories. This may well not be exactly the case\n\n\nfor some of the models, but as will be shown later, all\n\n\nmodels exhibit characteristics of a Hadley circulation in\n\n\nthis region, suggesting that the model boundary layer\n\n\ntrajectories do not diverge profoundly from the ERA-40\n\n\nresults.\n\n\nThe 2D dataset mentioned above is used so as to in-\n\n\nvestigate how representative histograms of variables, like\n\n\ntotal cloud cover (TCC) and precipitation, are along the\n\n\nGPCI transect compared to longitudinally adjacent points\n\n\n(5 degrees to the east and to the west). Figure 4 shows the\n\n\nhistograms of precipitation for one GPCI point (58N,\n\n\n1958E) and the two adjacent points from the GFDL, and\n\n\nNCAR models for the period of June\u2013July\u2013August\n\n\n1998. Figure 5 shows a similar plot but for the TCC and\n\n\nanother GPCI point\u2014208N, 2158E.

Similar results\n\n\nare obtained for different points along the GPCI transect\n\n\nas well as for different models (not shown). Overall, these\n\n\nresults support the idea that GPCI is sufficiently repre-\n\n\nsentative for the purposes of this study of the main model\n\n\nphysical processes of the subtropics in this region.\n\n\n4. Mean single-level parameter results\n\n\nIn this and the following subsections several results will\n\n\nbe analyzed. The results shown correspond to June\u2013July\u2013\n\n\nAugust 1998. The sea surface temperature (SST) boundary\n\n\ncondition is prescribed in virtually all of the models (the\n\n\nexception being the NCEP coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere\n\n\nversion] but following slightly independent implemen-\n\n\ntation techniques (e.g., different SST analysis). Figure 6\n\n\nshows the June\u2013July\u2013August 1998 mean SST prescribed\n\n\n(or obtained, in the case of the coupled system) for each of\n\n\nthe model simulations along the GPCI transect. Although\n\n\nusing slightly different implementations for describing\n\n\nSST, all of the (uncoupled) models show similar SST\n\n\ndistributions along the GPCI transect. The SSTs increase\n\n\nalmost linearly southward from the cold waters (;290 K)\n\n\noff the coast of California and peak in the ITCZ region\n\n\n(;302 K). The SST from the NCEP coupled simulation\n\n\n[NCEP GFS and MOM3 (G&amp;M3) in the figure] is\n\n\nwarmer in the subtropical regions, associated (at least\n\n\npartly) with a negative cloud bias. We will return to this\n\n\nimportant feedback between low clouds and the SST.\n\n\nFigure 7a shows the ensemble (composed of the differ-\n\n\nent models) model mean and the across-model variabil-\n\n\nity of total column water vapor (TWV) along the GPCI\n\n\ntransect for JJA 1998. The across-model variability is\n\n\ncharacterized by the ensemble mean plus or minus the\n\n\nstandard deviation and by the maximum and minimum\n\n\nvalues attained by any of the models (range) for a par-\n\n\nticular GPCI-transect point. Also shown are the results\n\n\nfrom ERA-40 and the SSM/I observations. The increase\n\n\nof TWV from the stratocumulus regions off California\n\n\ntoward the ITCZ follows the increase in SST. According to\n\n\nSSM/I, the TWV increases from around 18 kg m22 close\n\n\nto the California coast (358N) to just over 50 kg m22 over\n\n\nthe ITCZ. This illustrates well the major changes that\n\n\nFIG. 2. Histograms of wind direction at 900 hPa for six points along the GPCI transect from ERA-40 (June\u2013July\u2013August 1998).\n\n\n15 OCTOBER 2011 T E I X E I R A E T A L . 5227\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noccur in the atmospheric column as it transitions from a\n\n\nsituation with a shallow boundary layer, capped by a dry\n\n\nupper troposphere, to a situation with fully developed\n\n\ndeep moist convection events.\n\n\nTWV is an integral parameter that is fundamental in\n\n\ncharacterizing the atmospheric hydrologic cycle. In this\n\n\ncontext, the good agreement between SSM/I and ERA-40\n\n\nis worthy of notice. If these observations and analyses\n\n\nwere to differ in any significant manner in terms of this\n\n\nkey parameter, this would mean that there were some\n\n\nserious deficiencies in either or both of these datasets.\n\n\nFortunately this is not the case. Of course, since ERA-40\n\n\nassimilates observations such as (or of the type of) SSM/I,\n\n\nit could still be argued that these similarities are to be\n\n\nexpected. In general, these results suggest that ERA-40\n\n\nis reproducing well this integral parameter in terms of\n\n\nthe hydrologic cycle. On the other hand, as will be amply\n\n\ndiscussed in this paper, ERA-40 still suffers from de-\n\n\nficiencies in many variables and this type of agreement\n\n\nbetween ERA-40 and the observations is not so com-\n\n\nmon for other parameters.\n\n\nMany of the models exhibit a behavior, in terms of\n\n\nTWV, that is not substantially different from the one\n\n\nobtained with SSM/I or ERA-40. This is not necessarily\n\n\nsurprising given the integral nature of TWV. Some models,\n\n\nhowever, do show noticeable departures from SSM/I\n\n\nand ERA-40 (in some, or even all, of the locations along\n\n\nthe GPCI transect). Because TWV is an integral measure\n\n\nof the atmospheric water vapor content, the across-model\n\n\nstandard deviation looks relatively small when compared\n\n\nto other variables, but the minimum and maximum values\n\n\nare of concern. In the stratocumulus regions, the differ-\n\n\nence between the maximum and minimum values is of\n\n\nthe same order of magnitude as the measured TWV.\n\n\nThese differences in terms of TWV are often associated\n\n\nwith differences in boundary layer height. Boundary layer\n\n\nheight is a key parameter in characterizing the cloudy\n\n\nboundary layer structure and, as will be discussed below,\n\n\nthe models produce a variety of behaviors leading to sig-\n\n\nnificant differences in terms of clouds and boundary layer\n\n\nheight (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2010). In the deep tropics the\n\n\ndifference between maximum and minimum values is\n\n\nO(20 kg m22).\n\n\nThe simulated and observed (ISCCP) total cloud cover\n\n\n(TCC) along the GPCI transect is shown in Fig. 7b.\n\n\nImmediately obvious, when compared with TWV, is the\n\n\nFIG. 3.

From this plot alone it is\n\n\nquite clear that weather and climate prediction models\n\n\nhave serious problems simulating clouds. Note that, as\n\n\nopposed to TWV (as discussed above), ERA-40 diverges\n\n\nsubstantially from ISCCP. Although ISCCP observations\n\n\nstill have significant uncertainties, in particular ISCCP\n\n\nTCC in the tropics is an underestimate by 10%\u201315%\n\n\nbecause of very thin cirrus that are not detected (e.g.,\n\n\nStubenrauch et al. 1999), it is fair to argue that at this stage\n\n\nof current understanding, the ISCCP cloud cover product\n\n\nis more trustworthy than ERA-40, which is an analysis\n\n\nthat assimilates virtually no explicit cloud information.\n\n\nIn particular, ERA-40 underestimates TCC in the strato-\n\n\ncumulus (and initial transition to cumulus) region, between\n\n\n238 and 358N and overestimates TCC in the ITCZ region.\n\n\nThis negative TCC bias in the stratocumulus regions was\n\n\nmuch more pronounced in ERA-15, the previous version\n\n\nof the reanalysis (Duynkerke and Teixeira 2001), but has\n\n\nbeen ameliorated with subsequent model improvements,\n\n\nnamely increased vertical resolution in the boundary layer\n\n\n(Teixeira 1999). ERA-Interim, the most recent ECWMF\n\n\nversion of the reanalysis, has shown significant additional\n\n\nimprovements of the simulations of marine low clouds\n\n\ndue to the implementation of the eddy-diffusivity mass-flux\n\n\napproach, originally proposed by Siebesma and Teixeira\n\n\n(2000), focused on the stratocumulus regime (Ko?hler 2005;\n\n\nHannay et al. 2009).\n\n\nThe models in general, as can be seen by the ensemble\n\n\nmean, still underestimate TCC in the stratocumulus\n\n\nregions\u2014a negative bias of around 20%\u201330% compared\n\n\nto ISCCP. Some models produce extremely low values\n\n\nof TCC in regions typically associated with stratocumulus\n\n\nand where ISCCP TCC is large. However, there are a few\n\n\nmodels that manage to simulate stratocumulus TCC in a\n\n\nrelatively accurate manner. In the trade cumulus regions\n\n\nbetween 148 and 208N the ensemble mean shows good\n\n\nagreement with ERA-40 and ISCCP. In the ITCZ region\n\n\nthe ensemble model mean is reasonably close to ISCCP,\n\n\nwhile ERA-40 overestimates TCC by as much as 20%\n\n\n(note, however, the possible ISCCP negative bias in the\n\n\ndeep tropics mentioned above). The standard deviation\n\n\nand range between maximum and minimum values of\n\n\nTCC in this region are also quite large. Overall the TCC\n\n\nacross-model variability (standard deviation and range) is\n\n\nuncomfortably large throughout the entire GPCI tran-\n\n\nsect: the difference between the maximum and minimum\n\n\nvalues is always larger than 50% cloud cover.\n\n\nIt is important to note that sometimes in the plots being\n\n\nshown the maximum and minimum values are associated\n\n\nwith models that are clearly underperforming when\n\n\nFIG. 4.

On the other hand, the range between models\n\n\nin variables like TCC is physically significant (not nec-\n\n\nessarily in a purely statistical sense) and should be in-\n\n\nterpreted as a serious problem of weather and climate\n\n\nprediction models in general. The reader interested in\n\n\nanalyzing the data from a particular model is advised to\n\n\ngo to the GPCI/DIME Web site (http://gcss-dime.giss.nasa.\n\n\ngov/gpci/modsim_gpci_models.html).\n\n\nFigure 7c shows the equivalent figure but for the liquid\n\n\nwater path (LWP) with observations from SSM/I. It is\n\n\nclear that both ERA-40 and the ensemble model mean\n\n\nunderestimate LWP in the stratocumulus regions, while\n\n\nERA-40 (but not the ensemble mean) overestimates LWP\n\n\nvalues over the trade cumulus regions. Over the deep\n\n\ntropics ERA-40 clearly overestimates LWP as compared\n\n\nwith SSM/I, with a peak of around 350 g m\n22\n\n\nversus an\n\n\nobserved peak of about 200 g m\n22\n\n\n, while the ensemble\n\n\nmean is relatively close to the observations.\n\n\nIt must be noted that LWP observations from micro-\n\n\nwave instruments such as SSM/I can have significant un-\n\n\ncertainties (see Li et al. 2008, for a comparison between\n\n\ndifferent satellite observations of LWP). The results\n\n\nshown in Fig. 7c are, however, consistent with the overall\n\n\npicture of an underestimation of clouds from ERA-40\n\n\nand the ensemble mean over the stratocumulus regions\n\n\nand an overestimation of ERA-40 over the ITCZ. More\n\n\nrecent observations such as from CloudSat (e.g., Stephens\n\n\net al. 2002) may help clarify some of the observational\n\n\nissues and narrow down the observational uncertainties.\n\n\nA remarkable characteristic of the model results is again\n\n\nFIG. 5.

This figure illustrates well a key dif-\n\n\nference between the subtropical regions dominated by\n\n\nboundary layer clouds and the ITCZ dominated by deep\n\n\nconvection. In models and observations the subtropics are\n\n\ncharacterized by modest (or virtually absent) amounts of\n\n\nprecipitation, with the exception of the model maximum\n\n\nvalue, showing that at least one model produces precip-\n\n\nitation close to 2 mm day\n21\n\n\nin the trade cumulus regions.\n\n\nNote that accurate observations of precipitation in these\n\n\nrelatively dry regions are hard to obtain (e.g., Adler et al.\n\n\n2003), and we should consider that the error bars asso-\n\n\nciated with GPCP in these regions are relatively large\n\n\n(percentwise) (e.g., Janowiak et al. 1998). Over the ITCZ,\n\n\nGPCP shows mean June\u2013July\u2013August 1998 values of\n\n\naround 9 mm day21 slightly below the model ensemble\n\n\nmean. ERA-40, on the other hand, produces values\n\n\nslightly above the maximum value of all the models and\n\n\nabout twice as estimated by GPCP; again, an overactive\n\n\nERA-40 in the deep tropics is apparent.\n\n\nThe outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) results are\n\n\nshown in Fig. 8a with observations from CERES. Over the\n\n\nsubtropical regions dominated by boundary layer clouds\n\n\ntopped by a dry free troposphere, the OLR CERES\n\n\nobservations lie in-between the model ensemble mean\n\n\nvalues (lower than the observations) and ERA-40 (higher\n\n\nthan the observations). In the deep convective regions\n\n\nERA-40 underestimates the OLR, when compared with\n\n\nCERES data, producing a bias of around 20 W m\n22\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhile the ensemble mean follows the CERES observa-\n\n\ntions quite closely. An underestimation of OLR in ERA-40\n\n\nfor the ITCZ is consistent with positive ERA-40 biases\n\n\nof LWP, precipitation, and TCC.\n\n\nThe equivalent figure for the net shortwave radiative\n\n\nflux at the top of the atmosphere (SW at TOA) is shown\n\n\nFIG. 7.

The results of\n\n\nnet SW at TOA from ERA-40 and from the ensemble\n\n\nmean are relatively similar in the subtropical regions.\n\n\nOver the stratocumulus areas both ERA-40 and the\n\n\nensemble mean overestimate the net SW at TOA by up\n\n\nto 50 W m22 on the mean, reflecting a negative bias in\n\n\nterms of cloud cover and cloud water. Over the Cu regions\n\n\nERA-40 and the ensemble model mean underestimate\n\n\nthe net SW radiation at TOA. For ERA-40 this can be\n\n\n(at least) partly explained by an overestimation of LWP\n\n\nin the region. Simulated subtropical trade wind cumulus\n\n\nhas been reported to be too reflective in climate models\n\n\ncompared to observations (e.g., Potter and Cess 2004;\n\n\nKarlsson et al. 2008). This might explain the ensemble\n\n\nmodel mean underestimation of net SW radiation in the\n\n\nCu regions. In the ITCZ the ensemble model mean shows\n\n\nbetter agreement with CERES, while ERA-40 is asso-\n\n\nciated with a negative TOA net SW radiation bias of\n\n\n;50 W m\n22\n\n\n, most likely connected to the positive LWP\n\n\nand cloud cover bias in the region. Again, the variability\n\n\nbetween the different models is substantial and clearly\n\n\nproblematic in particular in the context of coupled ocean\u2013\n\n\natmosphere seasonal and climate prediction.\n\n\n5. Vertical cross sections\n\n\nFigure 9 shows vertical cross sections of subsidence in\n\n\nPa s21 along the GPCI transect from the different models.\n\n\nQualitatively all models produce (as expected) features\n\n\nthat resemble the Hadley circulation with dominant up-\n\n\nward motion over the ITCZ and a dominant subsidence\n\n\nregion throughout the subtropical free troposphere.\n\n\nIn spite of the qualitative agreement, there are several\n\n\nsubstantial differences between the models. For example,\n\n\nsome models, ETH/MPI being the most extreme case,\n\n\nexhibit a fairly shallow layer of upward vertical motion\n\n\nin the ITCZ (in the ETH\u2013MPI model over the ITCZ the\n\n\nlayer of upward mean vertical velocity does not appear\n\n\nto extend above 700 hPa). The width and strength of the\n\n\ndeep convection regions are other examples of the dif-\n\n\nferences between the models, with the GISS model\n\n\nhaving a fairly wide and weak deep convection (as given\n\n\nby the vertical velocity field) while ERA-40 has a rela-\n\n\ntively narrow and much stronger deep convection ver-\n\n\ntical velocity structure. Another relevant difference is\n\n\nthe fact that some models have a peak of vertical ve-\n\n\nlocity in the convective regions in the lower troposphere\n\n\nwhile others also have a peak in the upper troposphere.\n\n\nIn addition, and although the patterns are in general\n\n\nrelatively similar between the different models, there are\n\n\ndifferences in the subsidence regions as well. In particular,\n\n\nthe free-troposphere vertical structure of subsidence in\n\n\nthe trade wind regions and the vertical extent of the sub-\n\n\nsidence field in the boundary layer can be quite different\n\n\nbetween the models. The vertical structure of subsidence\n\n\nis crucial in determining the vertical extent of boundary\n\n\nlayer convection and the characteristics of clouds.\n\n\nThe corresponding results for relative humidity are\n\n\nshown in Fig. 10. Relative humidity is a particularly in-\n\n\nformative field in terms of the characterization of the\n\n\natmospheric hydrologic cycle in a variety of aspects from\n\n\nboundary layer and cloud properties to the dryness of the\n\n\nsubtropical free troposphere. As with subsidence, a first\n\n\nlook at the different relative humidity model fields shows\n\n\nFIG. 8. (a) Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from the models along GPCI for June\u2013July\u2013August 1998 together\n\n\nwith ERA-40 and CERES, (b) as in (a) but for net shortwave radiation at the TOA and CERES observations. Results\n\n\nfrom the different models are shown as ensemble mean results, the mean plus or minus the standard deviation, and\n\n\nthe maximum and minimum values attained by any model for a particular point (referred to as range).\n\n\n5232 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat all models possess the qualitative characteristics of a\n\n\nHadley-like circulation. The boundary layer evolves from\n\n\nshallow and cloudy (with high values of relative humidity)\n\n\nover the cold upwelling waters off California to a deeper\n\n\ntrade-wind boundary layer over warmer waters. Over the\n\n\nwarm regions of the ITCZ the troposphere is dominated\n\n\nby deep convection (in general, with high relative humid-\n\n\nity values throughout the troposphere) and in the sub-\n\n\ntropical free troposphere the dynamics is dominated by\n\n\nthe large-scale subsidence associated with very low values\n\n\nof relative humidity.\n\n\nIn spite of the qualitative agreement between the\n\n\nmodels, the level of disagreement is significant. In terms\n\n\nof the boundary layer the most obvious difference is re-\n\n\nlated to how the boundary layer grows from the Sc re-\n\n\ngions to the Cu regions in the models. Some models show\n\n\na low boundary layer height over the Sc regions [e.g.,\n\n\nNCAR, UQM) often together with a low growth of the\n\n\nboundary layer over warmer waters, while other models\n\n\nseem to produce an excessive growth of the boundary\n\n\nlayer reaching values that are not realistic (e.g., the DWD\n\n\nproduces a boundary layer height over the trade cumulus\n\n\nregions close to 700 hPa). Note that we do not compare\n\n\ndirectly model relative humidity results with observa-\n\n\ntions in this paper [e.g., results from comparisons with\n\n\nthe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are left for\n\n\na future publication], and that this discussion is meant to\n\n\nhighlight the differences between the models (and the\n\n\nERA-40 analysis).\n\n\nAs discussed before concerning vertical velocity, models\n\n\nshow substantial differences in terms of deep convection\n\n\nthat are even more obvious when analyzing the vertical\n\n\ndistribution of relative humidity along the GPCI transect.\n\n\nDifferences are clear not only in terms of strength and\n\n\nwidth of deep convection but also in terms of wetness and\n\n\ndryness (in relative humidity terms) of particular regions\n\n\nof the atmosphere. For example, virtually all models have\n\n\na minimum of relative humidity around 400 hPa but dis-\n\n\nagree on the absolute value of the relative humidity mini-\n\n\nmum. Some of the models (e.g., ETH\u2013MPI, Me?te?o-France,\n\n\nUCLA) have values of relative humidity that are lower\n\n\nthan 20%, while other models (e.g., GFDL, JAMSTEC)\n\n\nhave values close to 50%. Below the tropical tropopause\n\n\nthe differences are also significant, with some models (e.g.,\n\n\nGISS, CMC) showing values of relative humidity close to\n\n\n40% while others [e.g., CSU multiscale modeling frame-\n\n\nwork (MMF), ECMWF] have values close to 100%.\n\n\nIn the subsidence regions over the subtropical bound-\n\n\nary layer, the models also show substantial differences\n\n\nhighlighting the fact that the physics of the free tropo-\n\n\nsphere in the models can be quite complex. Below the\n\n\ntropopause close to 358N, models range from the very dry\n\n\n(e.g., DWD, GISS) with relative humidity close to 10% to\n\n\nthe very wet with relative humidity close to 70% (e.g., CSU\n\n\nBUGS). All models exhibit a minimum value for relative\n\n\nhumidity in some region of the subtropical free tropo-\n\n\nsphere, but the location of this region can vary signifi-\n\n\ncantly from model to model. Some models exhibit this\n\n\nminimum above the stratocumulus regions (e.g., NCAR)\n\n\nwhile other models (e.g., GKSS), Meteo-France) exhibit\n\n\na minimum much closer to the deep convection regions.\n\n\nFigure 11 shows similar results for cloud fraction cross\n\n\nsections. This figure illustrates well the vast differences\n\n\nbetween models and is a good preamble for the detailed\n\n\ndiagnostics and discussion that will follow in the sub-\n\n\nsequent sections. Qualitatively, virtually all models seem\n\n\nto follow the expected evolution of the boundary layer\n\n\nfrom the stratocumulus regions to deep tropics, but often\n\n\nwith fairly significant differences. Some models [e.g.,\n\n\nECMWF, GFDL, UKMO) show a smooth and gradual\n\n\nevolution of the cloudy boundary layer height that, based\n\n\non some previous studies, appears to be relatively realistic\n\n\n(e.g., Wyant et al. 1997; Wood and Bretherton 2004; von\n\n\nEngeln et al. 2005; Karlsson et al. 2010). But, there are\n\n\nmany issues including (i) models that have stratocumulus\n\n\nclouds too close to the surface (e.g., NCAR); (ii) models\n\n\nthat produce cloudy boundary layers that are too deep\n\n\nover the trades (e.g., DWD); (iii) models that produce\n\n\na cloud evolution by generating two fairly distinct cloud\n\n\nlayers (e.g., BMRC); (iv) models that produce very\n\n\nsmall values of cloud cover; and (v) models that show no\n\n\nclear evolution of the cloudy boundary layer from stra-\n\n\ntocumulus to cumulus (e.g., NCEP).\n\n\nThe fact that there are two sets of results from NCEP,\n\n\ncoupled and uncoupled to an ocean model (NCEP\n\n\nGFG&amp;MOM3 and NCEP, respectively), leads to some\n\n\ninsight into the impact on clouds of the coupling to an\n\n\nocean model. Both coupled and uncoupled versions show\n\n\nsmall amounts of boundary layer cloud fraction, with a\n\n\npeak positioned too far to the southwest and no clear\n\n\nevolution of the cloudy boundary layer from stratocu-\n\n\nmulus to cumulus. However, the uncoupled version pro-\n\n\nduces larger values of cloud cover (close to 40%) than the\n\n\ncoupled version (less than 20%), and the SST of the\n\n\ncoupled model version is overestimated (Fig. 6). These\n\n\nresults are associated with a well-known positive feed-\n\n\nback between subtropical boundary layer clouds and the\n\n\nSST, where a negative bias in cloud cover and cloud water\n\n\nleads to warmer surface waters (due to increased short-\n\n\nwave radiation at the ocean surface) that, in turn, lead to\n\n\neven less clouds (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; Ma et al. 1996;\n\n\nPark et al. 2005; Teixeira et al. 2008).

In the lower troposphere\n\n\nsome models show large cloud amounts (e.g., Me?te?o-\n\n\nFrance) while other models show virtually no clouds (e.g.,\n\n\nJAMSTEC). In the upper troposphere some models have\n\n\nlarge values of cloud cover (e.g., NCAR) while others\n\n\nhave relatively small values (e.g., GISS, Meteo-France).\n\n\nSimilar results for liquid water content are shown in\n\n\nFig. 12, where in addition to the model data, the June\u2013July\u2013\n\n\nAugust climatology (2006\u201310) of liquid water content from\n\n\nCloudSat observations is plotted as well (e.g., Stephens\n\n\net al. 2008). In most respects the liquid water content\n\n\nfigures confirm the general results obtained for cloud\n\n\nfraction. However, there are some noteworthy features\n\n\nthat are important to highlight. Some models erroneously\n\n\nproduce liquid water at altitudes where most likely there\n\n\nis virtually no liquid water. At this stage it is unclear if\n\n\nthese are postprocessing issues or real model problems.\n\n\nSome models do reproduce the expected evolution of\n\n\nclouds along the transition from stratocumulus to cumu-\n\n\nlus with values of mean boundary layer liquid water that\n\n\nare roughly similar to the values obtained from CloudSat,\n\n\nwhich is clearly a positive sign both from a modeling and\n\n\nobservational perspective. In this context it must be noted\n\n\nthat CloudSat has some problems related to the retrieval\n\n\nof liquid water content in the boundary layer. Independent\n\n\nof specific issues related to the retrieval methodology,\n\n\nCloudSat has difficulties in obtaining reliable measure-\n\n\nments close to the ground (roughly below 1 km above the\n\n\nsurface) and its vertical resolution (;250\u2013500 m) is not\n\n\nadequate to fully resolve the strong gradients close to the\n\n\ntop of the boundary layer. Owing to these constraints,\n\n\nCloudSat is not able to produce a Sc-to-Cu transition as\n\n\nclearly as some of the models. In spite of this, CloudSat\n\n\nappears to support the idea that the cloudy boundary-\n\n\nlayer height evolves from values close to 1 km above the\n\n\nsurface near the coast of California to near 2 km in the\n\n\ntrade cumulus regions.\n\n\nSome of the models do exhibit what appears to be\n\n\nclearly pathological behavior in the subtropical bound-\n\n\nary layer region\u2014from models that show extremely low\n\n\nvalues of liquid water content (with maximum values\n\n\nclose to 0.02 g kg21) to models that have different dis-\n\n\ncrete layers of cloud in the vertical. In spite of the fairly\n\n\npoor model results (in general) in the Sc to Cu transition\n\n\nregion, close to the ITCZ the model results can be con-\n\n\nsidered even worse. In these deep tropical regions the\n\n\nmodel liquid water content vertical structure is almost as\n\n\nvaried as the number of models. Hardly any two models\n\n\nseem to share a similar cloud liquid water vertical struc-\n\n\nture. If the CloudSat observations are used as guidance, it\n\n\nis possible to state that the UKMO appears as the model\n\n\nthat is closest to the observations. But even this is argu-\n\n\nable given the fairly ad-hoc manner in which the CloudSat\n\n\nretrieval algorithm discriminates between liquid water\n\n\nand ice (based on a simple mixed-phase relation using\n\n\ntemperature from ECMWF analysis).\n\n\nOverall, these figures illustrate the enormous difficulty\n\n\nthat models have in even producing cloud vertical struc-\n\n\ntures that are somewhat in qualitative agreement with\n\n\neach other and with the few global observations that exist.\n\n\nNote that additional results and figures can be obtained\n\n\nat the GPCI/DIME webpage (see section 4).\n\n\n6. Boundary layer cloud transition and statistics\nusing sharp gradients\n\n\nIn the previous sections we reported on a variety of\n\n\nmodel diagnostics related to cloud regime transitions. This\n\n\nwas done mainly with the goal of characterizing the mean\n\n\nthermodynamic structure in a variety of weather and cli-\n\n\nmate prediction models. In this section, and in the fol-\n\n\nlowing one, we use cloud data from the different models\n\n\nand from ISCCP observations to characterize in more\n\n\ndetail the cloud transitions in the tropics and subtropics\n\n\nand to evaluate how well the models reproduce these\n\n\ntransitions. In this context we try to relate the results of\n\n\nsome of these models with the parameterizations used\n\n\nfor representing clouds and the boundary layer.\n\n\nIn a previous section (Fig. 7b) the June\u2013July\u2013August\n\n\n1998 mean TCC along the GPCI cross section for the\n\n\nmodel ensemble mean, ERA-40, and ISCCP is shown. This\n\n\ntype of typical seasonal mean is calculated in a straightfor-\n\n\nward way, by estimating the temporal mean at each one\n\n\nof the cross-section points. However, since instantaneous\n\n\n(3-hourly) values of cloud cover can have sharp gradients\n\n\nalong the GPCI transect, this averaging methodology will\n\n\nsmooth out the gradients and will consequently lose in-\n\n\nformation related to these discontinuities, which are im-\n\n\nportant manifestations of the stratocumulus to cumulus\n\n\ntransition.\n\n\nIn this section a different methodology to perform the\n\n\naveraging is proposed: by (i) determining the location of\n\n\nthe first sharp gradient (specifically a drop with a partic-\n\n\nular threshold of 20 or 30%) in total cloud cover (TCC)\n\n\nalong the transect starting at the northernmost point (Sc\n\n\nregion) every three hours and then (ii) assuming uniform\n\n\ncloud cover to the northeast (NE) and southwest (SW)\n\n\nof the gradient\u2019s location by taking the spatial averages\n\n\nof TCC for all the points to each side (NE and SW) of the\n\n\nlocation of the sharp gradient. Figure 13 shows that,\n\n\nusing this methodology, it is possible to capture some of\n\n\nthe features of this discontinuous transition. The results\n\n\nin this figure correspond to TCC data from ISCCP and\n\n\nERA-40. The left figure shows averaged TCC for both\n\n\n5242 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERA-40 and ISCCP based on this methodology (i.e.,\n\n\naveraged TCC for all the points south and north of each\n\n\nindividual transition location) with the jump in TCC\n\n\nbeing located at the mean gradient location, while the\n\n\nfigure on the right shows histograms of the locations of\n\n\nthese strong (.30%) gradients of TCC. Using different\n\n\nthresholds for the drop of TCC (e.g., 20% or 30%) does\n\n\nnot make much of a difference in the final mean results,\n\n\nwhich is a positive outcome regarding the robustness of\n\n\nthe method. Note that even in the subtropics changes in\n\n\nTCC may not reflect only changes in boundary layer cloud\n\n\ncover [or low cloud cover (LCC)] but also changes in high\n\n\nand midlevel cloud cover.\n\n\nThere are substantial differences between ERA-40 and\n\n\nISCCP in this context. The mean gradient strength is dif-\n\n\nferent between the two with values around 40% for ISCCP\n\n\nand 20% for ERA-40. The TCC values to the northeast\n\n\nand southwest of the gradient\u2019s location are quite different\n\n\nas well\u2014to the northeast of the mean gradient location\n\n\nISCCP TCC is about 10% larger than ERA-40 TCC, while\n\n\nto the southwest ERA-40 TCC is about 15% larger than\n\n\nISCCP TCC. The mean location of the gradient is also\n\n\ndifferent, with the ERA-40 location being at 268N while\n\n\nthe ISCCP location is at 208N.\n\n\nThis analysis suggests that the ERA-40 negative cloud\n\n\nbias in the Sc regions is related, not only to the fact that\n\n\nTCC values in the Sc regions are in general lower than in the\n\n\nISCCP data, but also to the fact that the transition from\n\n\nstratocumulus to cumulus (i.e., location of the mean gradi-\n\n\nent) is too far to the northeast\u2014too early from a Lagrangian\n\n\nperspective\u2014as compared to ISCCP observations.\n\n\nAn analysis of the histogram of locations of the sharp\n\n\ngradient for both ERA-40 and ISCCP (Fig. 13, right panel)\n\n\nclearly shows that the transition from stratocumulus to\n\n\ncumulus occurs too early (in a Lagrangian perspective)\n\n\nin the ERA-40 dataset with a histogram peak close to the\n\n\ncoast of California (358N), while the peak in the ISCCP\n\n\nobservations is close to 238N. Another difference between\n\n\nthe two datasets is the occurrence (occ) of instantaneous\n\n\ngradients (larger than 30%) of TCC along the GPCI\n\n\ntransect. It is slightly less in the ISCCP dataset (around\n\n\n90% of the times) than in the ERA-40 dataset (around\n\n\n97% of the times). Note that, for TCC gradients larger than\n\n\n50%, ISCCP and ERA-40 have a frequency of occurrence\n\n\ngreater than 60% and 70%, respectively (not shown).\n\n\nFigure 14 shows similar results, but for the different\n\n\nmodels, where it is clear that there are substantial dif-\n\n\nferences between the models in this context. These major\n\n\ndifferences exist in all of the main parameters being ana-\n\n\nlyzed: the location and strength of the mean gradient,\n\n\nthe cloud amount northeast and southwest of the mean\n\n\ngradient\u2019s location, and the characteristics of the histo-\n\n\ngram of the gradient locations.\n\n\nIn terms of the strength of the mean gradient there are\n\n\nimportant differences between models such as UCLA, CSU\n\n\nBUGS, and UKMO (with gradients stronger than 40% on\n\n\nthe mean) and models such as CMC that have virtually no\n\n\ngradient in TCC between stratocumulus and cumulus re-\n\n\ngimes (recall that ISCCP has a value of around 40%). The\n\n\nstronger gradients in models such as UKMO and UCLA\n\n\nare probably related to the nature of the cloudy boundary-\n\n\nlayer formulation. This will be discussed in more detail in\n\n\nthe next section. In terms of the frequency of occurrence of\n\n\ngradients in TCC as large as 30%, most models are close to\n\n\nthe results from ERA-40 with values just slightly below\n\n\n100% except for the following models: NCAR, LMD,\n\n\nCCCma, and GISS, which have values below 90%.\n\n\nAgain, and as expected, there is a large amount of var-\n\n\niability in terms of the TCC values to the northeast and\n\n\nsouthwest of the mean gradient locations for the different\n\n\nFIG. 13.

In addition, there is a variety of shapes for the\n\n\nmodel histograms of the instantaneous locations of these\n\n\nstrong gradients.

(Continued)\n\n\n15 OCTOBER 2011 T E I X E I R A E T A L . 5245\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalid questions regarding the model simulations are 1) how\n\n\nare the models reproducing this transition; 2) how do the\n\n\nmodels compare to satellite observations (e.g., ISCCP) of\n\n\nthe transition; and 3) is this transition, in TCC, for example,\n\n\nfairly abrupt or pretty continuous in its nature?\n\n\nAs an attempt to answer these questions, Fig. 15 shows\n\n\nhistograms of instantaneous TCC along the GPCI tran-\n\n\nsect from the different models, ERA-40, and the ISCCP\n\n\nobservations for JJA98. Again, a variety of behaviors be-\n\n\ntween the different models is clear. In this context models\n\n\nsuch as NCAR and UKMO illustrate well two very dis-\n\n\ntinct behaviors. It is clear that the differences in TCC be-\n\n\ntween the models are more than just differences in terms\n\n\nof mean TCC, which is a traditional metric for the eval-\n\n\nuation of cloud cover parameterizations in climate pre-\n\n\ndiction models. In the UKMO model, the cloud cover\n\n\nshows a clear bimodal structure with most events occur-\n\n\nring for TCC values either close to 0% or close to 100%.\n\n\nNCAR, on the other hand, shows a substantially distinct\n\n\nbehavior with a relatively smooth transition from the\n\n\nsubtropical stratocumulus regions to the tropics. These\n\n\nfairly distinct results were already clear when analyzing\n\n\nFig. 5, which illustrated the differences between the GFDL\n\n\nand NCAR TCC in the GPCI point situated at 208N. In\n\n\npractice, at latitudes close to 208N, a typical transition re-\n\n\ngion between stratocumulus and cumulus regimes, these\n\n\nthree models (GFDL, UKMO, and NCAR) have fairly\n\n\nsimilar JJA98 mean TCC values. However, it is clear from\n\n\nthese histograms that similar mean results can be associ-\n\n\nated with significantly different cloud distributions.\n\n\nThese two very distinct behaviors are associated with\n\n\nthe manner in which clouds and cloud-related processes are\n\n\nFIG. 14. (Continued)\n\n\n5246 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameterized. In the NCAR model, cloud cover associ-\n\n\nated with the subtropical boundary layer is partly param-\n\n\neterized based on dependence on the lower-tropospheric\n\n\nstability (LTS) parameter, which is defined as the differ-\n\n\nence between the potential temperature at 700 hPa and\n\n\nat the surface (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Rasch and\n\n\nKristja?nsson 1998). This empirical relation is based on\n\n\nobservations (e.g., Slingo 1980; Klein and Hartmann\n\n\n1993) and versions based on similar ideas have been used\n\n\nas boundary-layer (stratocumulus) cloud cover parame-\n\n\nterizations for some time (e.g., Slingo 1987). However,\n\n\nthis empirical dependence is apparently valid in longer\n\n\ntime scales (e.g., seasonal) but not necessarily at the\n\n\ntypical time-step and horizontal gridbox scales (e.g.,\n\n\nKawai and Teixeira 2010). By utilizing this dependence\n\n\nbetween cloud cover and LTS directly as a cloud cover\n\n\nparameterization, the NCAR model is partly imposing\n\n\na climatological value of cloud cover leading to the fairly\n\n\ncontinuous TCC transition shown in Fig. 15. Note how-\n\n\never that, although the LTS parameterization is likely\n\n\nresponsible for the behavior of the NCAR TCC statistics,\n\n\nthis cannot be stated for sure because of a variety of rea-\n\n\nsons: total cloud cover is not the same as level-by-level\n\n\ncloud fraction (there is a cloud overlap calculation in-\n\n\nvolved), the cloud fraction at each point and level is de-\n\n\ntermined as some combination of different cloud fractions\n\n\nof which the LTS cloud fraction is only one, and it is also\n\n\nnot clear how often the LTS cloud fraction parameteri-\n\n\nzation determines the final values of cloud fraction.\n\n\nThe UKMO model (and partly GFDL) has a cloudy\n\n\nboundary layer parameterization based on the concept\n\n\nof \u2018\u2018distinct cloud regimes\u2019\u2019 (e.g., Lock et al. 2000), which\n\n\nassumes that the subtropical boundary layer can be di-\n\n\nvided in a finite number of different types or regimes\n\n\n(e.g., stratocumulus, cumulus, transition from cumulus\n\n\nto stratocumulus). In this approach the problem of\n\n\nparameterizing boundary layer properties is appar-\n\n\nently simplified by the fact that only a finite number of\n\n\ndifferent physical regimes need to be represented. A\n\n\nkey problem of this parameterization philosophy is\n\n\nthe representation of the transitions between the\n\n\ndifferent discreet regimes. This \u2018\u2018discrete\u2019\u2019 nature of\n\n\nthe UKMO cloudy boundary layer parameterization\n\n\nis presumably responsible for relatively sharp cloud\n\n\nregime transitions and consequently the bimodal na-\n\n\nture of the TCC histograms.\n\n\nIn Fig. 15 ISCCP observations of TCC (shown twice at\n\n\nthe bottom of each page) show results that are somewhere\n\n\nin-between these two extreme behaviors. Although ISCCP\n\n\nshows a certain degree of bimodality these results suggest\n\n\nthat none of these more \u2018\u2018extreme\u2019\u2019 parameterization phi-\n\n\nlosophies produces a fully realistic answer when compared\n\n\nto the observations.\n\n\nAlthough many of them do fall into one of these cate-\n\n\ngories, models exhibit a variety of behaviors in terms of\n\n\nTCC histograms. The GISS model, for example, shows no\n\n\napparent transition, while the CCC model exhibits quite\n\n\na complex distribution. The UCLA model, on the other\n\n\nhand, shows a fairly random histogram. In addition, some\n\n\nmodels exhibit histogram peaks in specific regions that are\n\n\nnot apparent in the observations: JAMSTEC has a clear\n\n\n30% peak at 88N, while KNMI has a 50% peak at around\n\n\n238N.\n\n\n8. Low cloud cover versus vertical velocity and\nsea surface temperature\n\n\nThe period of this study (June\u2013July\u2013August 1998) is too\n\n\nshort to obtain statistically significant results concerning\n\n\nrelations between cloud properties such as cloud cover\n\n\nand other properties such as measures of vertical sta-\n\n\nbility (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Wood and\n\n\nBretherton 2006; Kawai and Teixeira 2010). However, it\n\n\nis still useful to investigate how different cloud structures\n\n\nproduced by different models relate to meteorological\n\n\nquantities such as SST and subsidence along GPCI.\n\n\nPrevious studies have shown a significant relation be-\n\n\ntween cloud cover and different variables that basically\n\n\ncharacterize atmospheric vertical stability in the cloudy\n\n\nboundary layer. Klein and Hartmann (1993) showed a\n\n\nstrong relation between seasonal low cloud cover (aver-\n\n\naged in fairly large regions of the oceanic subtropics) and\n\n\nlower tropospheric stability, while Wood and Bretherton\n\n\n(2006) showed improved dependencies using a variant of\n\n\nLTS. Kawai and Teixeira (2010) showed that not only\n\n\ncloud cover correlates better with a variable related to\n\n\ncloud top entrainment instability (CTEI), but that in ad-\n\n\ndition higher moments of LWP (variance, skewness, and\n\n\nkurtosis) are also strongly related to this CTEI variable.\n\n\nIn the present study, the relation between low cloud\n\n\ncover (LCC), on the one hand, and vertical velocity and\n\n\nSST, on the other, in a few models and ERA-40, is in-\n\n\nvestigated in more detail. Both vertical velocity and SST\n\n\nare known to be related to LCC in the subtropics. Over the\n\n\nSc regions, with cold SSTs and large values of subsidence,\n\n\nLCC values are typically large. While being advected over\n\n\nwarmer waters and regions with lower values of sub-\n\n\nsidence, LCC typically decreases.\n\n\nThe 2D joint histograms of SST and subsidence at\n\n\n700 hPa for the period JJA98 are analyzed (not shown)\n\n\nfor ERA-40 and the following models: NCAR, GFDL,\n\n\nUKMO, and the NCEP coupled simulation.

It\n\n\nis also clear that, while in the UKMO and ERA-40 there\n\n\nis a gradual LCC transition as a function of SST, NCAR\n\n\nand GFDL show LCC peaks that are not associated with\n\n\nthe coldest temperatures and are related to negative\n\n\nsubsidence values.

Conclusions\n\n\nIn this paper an analysis of cloud transitions, in weather\n\n\nand climate prediction models, in tropical and subtropical\n\n\nregions is performed. Three-hourly datasets from a vari-\n\n\nety of models were used in the context of the GCSS/\n\n\nWGNE Pacific Cross-section Intercomparison (GPCI)\n\n\nfor the June\u2013July\u2013August 1998 season. The focus is on\n\n\nstudying cloud cover changes from extensive stratocumuli\n\n\ndecks (with high values of cloud cover) to situations\n\n\nwhere cumuli (with low values of cloud cover) domi-\n\n\nnate. This is an important transition in the context of\n\n\ncloud\u2013climate feedbacks, and characterizing how differ-\n\n\nent models simulate this transition is a key task in model\n\n\ndiagnostics.\n\n\nThis study reiterates many of the general concerns in\n\n\nterms of simulations of clouds and cloud-related pro-\n\n\ncesses (which apply not only to models but also to re-\n\n\nanalysis such as ERA-40), some of them already reported\n\n\nin the EUROCS (Siebesma et al. 2004) and other sim-\n\n\nilar diagnostic studies. Models tend to underestimate\n\n\nclouds in the stratocumulus regions, both in cloud cover\n\n\n(as compared to ISCCP) and liquid water path (as com-\n\n\npared to SSM/I), which is reflected in positive shortwave\n\n\nradiation biases at the surface and top of the atmosphere.\n\n\nIn the deep tropics, ERA-40 (in particular) overestimates\n\n\ncloud cover, liquid water path, precipitation and (as\n\n\na consequence) underestimates the outgoing longwave\n\n\nradiation.\n\n\nA major concern is the large spread in the results\n\n\nbetween the different models in terms of cloud cover,\n\n\nliquid water path, and shortwave radiation. Although\n\n\nall models exhibit a Hadley-like circulation (in terms of\n\n\nvertical velocity and relative humidity) the differences\n\n\nbetween them are substantial, in particular, in terms of\n\n\ncloud cover and liquid water content vertical structure.\n\n\nThe fact that for cloud-related variables ERA-40 often\n\n\nproduces results that are less realistic than many of the\n\n\nmodels is a great illustration of the problems associated\n\n\nwith assimilating cloud-related information in weather\n\n\nprediction models.\n\n\nIt is important that the models should be able not only\n\n\nto produce realistic values of mean cloud cover over the\n\n\nstratocumulus and cumulus regions (which has been his-\n\n\ntorically a major problem for climate and weather pre-\n\n\ndiction models) but also be able to capture some of the\n\n\nmore dynamic features that are discussed in this paper\n\n\nsuch as the sharp gradients of cloud cover along the GPCI\n\n\ncross section and cloud cover histograms in general.\n\n\nAn analysis of the results using these tailored diagnostics\n\n\nallows one to dig deeper into the reasons for the defi-\n\n\nciencies exhibited by the models and to connect these\n\n\nshortcomings with parameterization methodologies.\n\n\nComparing the cloud cover mean statistics obtained by\n\n\ntaking into account sharp gradients in cloud cover along\n\n\nthe GPCI transect, allows one, for example, to determine\n\n\nthat the negative cloud bias of ERA-40 in the stratocu-\n\n\nmulus regions (as compared to ISCCP) is associated\n\n\n(i) not only to lower values of cloud cover in these regimes\n\n\nbut also (ii) to a stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition that\n\n\noccurs too early along the trade-wind Lagrangian tra-\n\n\njectory (too much to the northeast).\n\n\nIt is shown that histograms of cloud cover along the\n\n\nGPCI cross section differ significantly from model to\n\n\nmodel. In particular, some models (e.g., UKMO) exhibit\n\n\na quasi-bimodal structure with cloud cover being either\n\n\nclose to 100% or close to 0%, while other models (e.g.,\n\n\nNCAR) show a more continuous transition. The ISCCP\n\n\nobservations show results that are somewhere in-between\n\n\nthese two extreme behaviors. We speculate that these\n\n\ndifferent patterns reflect the different nature of the\n\n\ncloud and boundary layer parameterizations, with some\n\n\nmodels (e.g., UKMO) basing their parameterizations on\n\n\nthe idea of distinct regimes (with the consequent sharp\n\n\ntransitions between them) while other models base their\n\n\nparameterizations on \u2018\u2018climatological\u2019\u2019 relations (e.g.,\n\n\nNCAR).\n\n\nAcknowledgments.

As the periods of interest were the seasons June\u2013\n\n\nJuly\u2013August 1998 and 2003, the simulations started 20 May\n\n\n1998 and 2003. The requested GPCI output corresponds to\n\n\nthe periods between 1 June and 31 August 1998 and 2003.\n\n\nRegarding the geographical area of interest, it was\n\n\nrequested that model data should be sent for i) 13 locations\n\n\nalong the GPCI cross section starting at 358N, 1258W and\n\n\nproceeding southwestward at 48 longitude and 38 latitude\n\n\nsteps to 18S, 1738W and ii) locations every 58 3 58 in a grid\n\n\nranging from 258 to 458N, 1608 to 2408E (referred to as\n\n\nthe 2D maps).\n\n\nFinally, the simulation results were submitted in high\n\n\ntemporal resolution every 3 h at hours 00, 03, 06, 09, 12,\n\n\n1500, 18, and 21 (UTC) and at full vertical resolution,\n\n\nthat is, on model levels.

The observations and the regional and\n\n\nglobal model data have been prepared in the context of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\n(GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) Pacific Cross-Section Intercomparison (GPCI). The GPCI transect\n\n\ncovers the transition from a stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer (MBL) off the coast of California to\n\n\na trade cumulus\u2013topped, less-well-defined, MBL, and finally to the deep-convection regions in the in-\n\n\ntertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Multiangle Im-\n\n\naging Spectroradiometer (MISR) have been used to derive observational records of the two BLH estimates.\n\n\nAnalyses from the ECMWF are also used in the study. Both BLH estimates in the models, the ECMWF\n\n\nanalysis, and the observations agree on a southward vertical growth of the MBL along the GPCI transect in\n\n\nthe stratocumulus region. Away from the region typically associated with extensive cloud cover, the two BLH\n\n\nestimates depict different evolutions of the MBL. In most models, the height of the main RH inversion\n\n\ndecreases southward from ;188N, reaching a minimum at the ITCZ, whereas the height of the RH inversion\n\n\nin the ECMWF analysis and a few of the models is fairly constant all the way to the ITCZ. As a result of\n\n\ninsufficient vertical resolution of the gridded dataset, the AIRS data only manage to reproduce the initial\n\n\ngrowth of the BLH. The median-model CTH increases from the stratocumulus-topped MBL to the ITCZ. In\n\n\ncontrast, the observed MISR CTHs decrease southward from 208N to the ITCZ, possibly indicative of the fact\n\n\nthat in these regions MISR manages to capture a variety of cloud tops with a mean that is below the subsidence\n\n\ninversion while the models and the ECMWF analysis mainly simulate CTHs corresponding to the height of\n\n\nthe subsidence inversion. In most models and in the ECMWF analysis, the height of the main RH inversion\n\n\nand the CTH tend to coincide in the northern part of the GPCI transect. In the regions associated with trade\n\n\ncumuli and deep convection there is a more ambiguous relation between the two BLH estimates. In this\n\n\nregion, most of the models place the CTH above the main RH inversion. The ECMWF analysis shows a good\n\n\nagreement between the BLH estimates throughout the transect.\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\nLarge persistent decks of low stratiform cloudiness\n\n\ncan be found in the eastern parts of the subtropical\n\n\nocean basins (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993). Because\n\n\nof large-scale subsidence and relatively cold waters, the\n\n\nmarine boundary layer (MBL) is normally shallow in\n\n\n* The National Center for Atmospheric Research is sponsored\n\n\nby the National Science Foundation.\n\n\nCorresponding author address: Johannes Karlsson, Department\n\n\nof Meteorology, Stockholm University, 10691 Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n\nE-mail: johannes@misu.su.se\n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2010 K A R L S S O N E T A L . 1845\n\n\nDOI: 10.1175/2010JAMC2338.1\n\n\n? 2010 American Meteorological Society\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthese regions and upside-down convection, generated by\n\n\ninfrared cloud-top cooling, is important for maintaining\n\n\nthe well-mixed MBL. When the air mass of the lower\n\n\ntroposphere is advected equatorward with the trade winds,\n\n\nit is exposed to increasing sea surface temperatures\n\n\n(SST) as well as weakening subsidence. The surface\n\n\nfluxes of heat and moisture increase, and surface-driven\n\n\nconvective updrafts become increasingly important\n\n\nfor maintaining the MBL. As a consequence of these\n\n\nchanges, the depth of the MBL is increasing and the\n\n\nstratocumulus-topped MBL evolves into a cumulus-topped\n\n\nMBL (e.g., Bretherton and Wyant 1997; Bretherton et al.\n\n\n1999).\n\n\nThere is a substantial contrast in cloud radiative forc-\n\n\ning between these two cloud regimes (Ramanathan et al.\n\n\n1989; Hartmann et al. 1992). In the stratocumulus re-\n\n\ngion the clouds, because of their extensive cloud cover,\n\n\nstrongly influence the top-of-the-atmosphere albedo.\n\n\nHowever, because of the relatively small difference be-\n\n\ntween cloud-top temperature and surface skin temper-\n\n\nature these clouds only weakly influence the outgoing\n\n\nlongwave radiation. During the summer, when the in-\n\n\nsolation is large, the surface net cloud radiative cool-\n\n\ning in the stratocumulus regime is around 100 W m\n22\n\n\n(Ramanathan et al. 1989). For the cumulus-topped re-\n\n\ngion the cloud cover is significantly smaller and the\n\n\noverall influence of these clouds on the radiation budget\n\n\nis less profound.\n\n\nIn the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s\n\n\nFourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4; Solomon et al.\n\n\n2007) differences in cloud response in a warmer climate\n\n\nare attributed to be the primary source of cross-model\n\n\nvariability, and thus uncertainty, of future projections.\n\n\nBony and Dufresne (2005) suggested that the main un-\n\n\ncertainty of the cloud feedback, in turn, is associated\n\n\nwith MBL clouds in regions of large-scale subsidence.\n\n\nThe decks of stratocumulus clouds found in the eastern\n\n\npart of the subtropical ocean basins and the mechanisms\n\n\nresponsible for the breakup into trade wind cumulus\n\n\nthus have substantial impact on the global climate. This\n\n\nhas been the motivation of several field campaigns\u2014for\n\n\nexample, the First International Satellite Cloud Clima-\n\n\ntology Project (ISCCP) Regional Experiment (FIRE;\n\n\nAlbrecht et al. 1988), the Atlantic Stratocumulus Tran-\n\n\nsition Experiment (ASTEX; Albrecht et al. 1995),\n\n\nthe East Pacific Investigation of Climate (EPIC) model\n\n\n(Bretherton et al. 2004), the Second Dynamics and Chem-\n\n\nistry of Marine Stratocumulus field study (DYCOMS-II;\n\n\nStevens et al. 2003), and Rain in Shallow Cumulus over\n\n\nthe Ocean (RICO; Rauber et al. 2007)\u2014as well as ex-\n\n\ntensive modeling activities (e.g., Krueger et al. 1995;\n\n\nBretherton et al. 1999; Svensson et al. 2000); McCaa and\n\n\nBretherton 2004).\n\n\nStill, the mechanisms responsible for the often abrupt\n\n\ntransition between the cloud regimes are not fully un-\n\n\nderstood. The concept of a cloud-top entrainment insta-\n\n\nbility (CTEI) was originally proposed by Lilly (1968) and\n\n\nwas further explored by Randall (1980) and Deardorff\n\n\n(1980). CTEI would occur when subsaturated air is en-\n\n\ntrained into the stratocumulus-topped MBL. The rela-\n\n\ntively lighter entrained air is then cooled by evaporation\n\n\nand might, under certain conditions, become negatively\n\n\nbuoyant. This is hypothesized to positively feed back on\n\n\nthe turbulent entrainment, resulting in the breakup of\n\n\nthe stratus layer. Whether the CTEI feedback is strong\n\n\nenough to account for the cloud breakup has, however,\n\n\nrecently been questioned (e.g., Yamaguchi and Randall\n\n\n2008). Other studies indicate that drizzle (e.g., Paluch\n\n\nand Lenschow 1991) and excess in-cloud latent heat\n\n\nrelease over cloud-top radiative cooling (Bretherton\n\n\nand Wyant 1997) cause a decoupling of the MBL. The\n\n\nconsequence of the decoupling is a decline in the vertical\n\n\nmoisture transport to the cloud layer, which eventually\n\n\nmay cause the stratus layer to break up.\n\n\nOver subtropical oceans, changes in the depth of the\n\n\nwell-mixed boundary layer, confined by the subsidence\n\n\ninversion, are associated with mesoscale and large-scale\n\n\nprocesses of vertical motion and temperature discrep-\n\n\nancies between the advected air mass and the SST. Air\n\n\nadvected equatorward with the trade winds from the\n\n\nrelatively shallow stratocumulus-topped MBL will expe-\n\n\nrience a vertical growth that is due to increasing en-\n\n\ntrainment of relatively warm and dry free-tropospheric\n\n\nair into the boundary layer and/or decreasing subsidence.\n\n\nThe simulation of boundary layer clouds in general\n\n\ncirculation models (GCMs) is a notorious challenge for\n\n\nthe modeling community (e.g., Weare 2004; Bony and\n\n\nDufresne 2005; Teixeira et al. 2008a; Karlsson et al.\n\n\n2008). To make reliable model projections of the future\n\n\nclimate it is important that changes occur for the right\n\n\nreasons. It is therefore necessary, although not suffi-\n\n\ncient, to have a good representation of the processes\n\n\nthat determine the present-day climate. Evaluating the\n\n\nrepresentation of the boundary layer height (BLH) in\n\n\nmodels offers an integrated way of evaluating the chain\n\n\nof processes that affects the MBL. The BLH is controlled\n\n\nby physical processes on a wide range of scales and also\n\n\nhas a close connection to the type of cloud regime and\n\n\nthus to the cloud forcing on the climate.\n\n\nThere are operational, surface-based, methods to de-\n\n\ntermine the height of the boundary layer [see Seibert\n\n\net al. (2000) for a review]. However, in remote regions\n\n\nknowledge on the vertical extent of the boundary layer\n\n\nstems from field campaigns and satellite estimates.

The increasing sophistication of\n\n\n1846 J O U R N A L O F A P P L I E D M E T E O R O L O G Y A N D C L I M A T O L O G Y VOLUME 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsatellite instrumentation opens up new possibilities to\n\n\nincrease our knowledge of the boundary layer. In re-\n\n\ngions where BLH coincides with the cloud-top height\n\n\n(CTH) of low clouds (i.e., stratocumulus regions), esti-\n\n\nmates of BLH can be derived from satellite-retrieved\n\n\ncloud-top heights (e.g., Minnis et al. 1992; Ahlgrimm\n\n\nand Randall 2006; Wood and Bretherton 2004; Zuidema\n\n\net al. 2009). Most of these studies derive the CTHs by\n\n\ncombining low-level cloud-top temperatures retrieved\n\n\nfrom passive satellite IR sensors with SSTs and lapse\n\n\nrates. These IR-derived CTH estimates do, however,\n\n\ndepend on several more or less empirically assured as-\n\n\nsumptions regarding, for example, the lapse rate valid\n\n\nfor the whole well-mixed MBL and the near-surface\n\n\ntemperature and humidity. In addition, the presence of\n\n\ntemperature inversions complicates CTH retrieval since\n\n\nthe temperature profiles will have the same temperature\n\n\nat two or more levels. Nevertheless, the BLH derived\n\n\nfrom IR retrievals has proven successful in regional\n\n\nevaluations (e.g., Minnis et al. 1992; Stevens et al. 2007).\n\n\nSome recent studies (e.g., Ahlgrimm and Randall 2006;\n\n\nLin et al. 2009) have instead utilized active spaceborne\n\n\nlidars to estimate the BLH from CTHs in the stratocu-\n\n\nmulus regions. The advantage of active sensors is that\n\n\nthey provide direct measurements of the CTHs. The rel-\n\n\natively poor spatial and temporal sampling is the down-\n\n\nside. For the period analyzed in this study no spaceborne\n\n\nlidar data are available.\n\n\nOther studies have utilized satellite retrievals to iden-\n\n\ntify the vertical location of the inversion in temperature\n\n\nand moisture that typically caps the boundary layer. To\n\n\nmention a couple, Fetzer et al. (2004) used Atmospheric\n\n\nInfrared Sounder (AIRS) data to identify the subsidence\n\n\ninversion off the coast of Baja California and von Engeln\n\n\net al. (2005) estimated a global distribution of planetary\n\n\nboundary layer height from radio occultation data.\n\n\nIn this study, we analyze the mean and variability of\n\n\nBLH along a transect in the eastern Pacific Ocean (see\n\n\nFig. 1) in models and observations. The transect covers\n\n\nthe transition from a stratocumulus-topped MBL off\n\n\nthe coast of California to a trade cumulus\u2013topped, less\n\n\ndefined, MBL, and finally to the deep convection in the\n\n\nITCZ as shown schematically in Fig. 2. In deriving the\n\n\nBLH two different estimates are used. The first esti-\n\n\nmate is the height of the maximum vertical gradient of\n\n\nrelative humidity (RH) with respect to pressure. Since\n\n\nthe RH is both temperature and moisture dependent it\n\n\nFIG. 1. The ISCCP D2 JJA climatological low cloudiness in the eastern subtropical and\n\n\ntropical Pacific Ocean.

The second estimate is the CTH\n\n\nof low clouds. In the stratus regime, cloud-top cooling\n\n\nacts to preserve the subsidence inversion, and therefore\n\n\nthe two BLH estimates are expected to coincide in this\n\n\nregion. In the trade wind cumulus\u2013topped MBL the\n\n\ncumulus clouds are the result of convective updrafts,\n\n\ngenerated by turbulent surface heat fluxes or mass con-\n\n\nvergence in the lowest layers of the atmosphere, which\n\n\npenetrate through the conditionally unstable layer above\n\n\nthe mixed layer. The vertical extent of the convective\n\n\nupdrafts depends on the energy input at the surface as\n\n\nwell as the vertical distribution of moisture and tem-\n\n\nperature in the lower troposphere. Thus, there is no a\n\n\npriori reason for these two BLH estimates to coincide in\n\n\nthe trade wind cumulus regime and even less in the\n\n\nproximity of the ITCZ. Still, the individual BLH esti-\n\n\nmates contain relevant information on the state of the\n\n\nMBL and the boundary layer clouds, information that\n\n\ncould be applicable when evaluating GCMs. The benefit\n\n\nof the two BLH estimates is that they enable a relatively\n\n\nstraightforward comparison between models and satellite\n\n\nobservations.\n\n\n2. Method and data\n\n\nModel and observational data are from the Global\n\n\nEnergy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud\n\n\nSystem Study (GCSS) Pacific Cross-Section Inter-\n\n\ncomparison (GPCI; Teixeira et al. 2008b, 2010, manu-\n\n\nscript submitted to J. Climate). The intention of GPCI\n\n\nis to provide a relatively simple framework to evaluate\n\n\nmodels against observations. The Pacific cross section is\n\n\nroughly aligned parallel to the trade winds and stretches\n\n\nfrom 358N, 1258W in the northeast to 18S, 1738W in the\n\n\nsouthwest (Fig. 1). The summer climatological low-level\n\n\ncloud fraction (Fig. 1) shows a smooth transition from\n\n\nextensive cloud cover in the stratocumulus region to\n\n\nsmaller cloud cover in the trade wind cumuli region and\n\n\nequatorward (from ISCCP \u2018\u2018D2\u2019\u2019 data; Rossow and\n\n\nSchiffer 1999). This smooth transition is largely a statis-\n\n\ntical feature; the transition is often abrupt in its nature\n\n\n(e.g., Teixeira et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to\n\n\nJ. Climate). On occasion, actinoform clouds form in\n\n\nconnection with the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transi-\n\n\ntion (Garay et al. 2004). Siebesma et al. (2004) carried\n\n\nout an intercomparison of cloud representation along\n\n\nthis Pacific cross section in GCMs. One of the main\n\n\nconclusions of their study was that most models sub-\n\n\nstantially overestimated (underestimated) the down-\n\n\nwelling surface radiation in the stratocumulus (trade wind\n\n\ncumuli) regime. The GPCI study involves more models\n\n\nand has a broader target and finer temporal resolution.\n\n\nThe period studied in our analysis is June, July, and\n\n\nAugust (JJA) of 2003. As a quasi-observational record,\n\n\nanalyses (model version CY26R3) from the European\n\n\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)\n\n\nare used.\n\n\na. Observations\n\n\n1) MULTIANGLE IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER\n\n\nThe Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR)\n\n\ninstrument on board the sun-synchronous polar-orbiting\n\n\nTerra satellite has nine cameras that view the earth at\n\n\ndifferent angles. The operational retrieval of CTHs re-\n\n\nsorts to stereo-matching algorithms that coregister re-\n\n\nflectivity patterns of different images (Muller et al. 2002)\n\n\nand to geometrical considerations that translate the total\n\n\ndisparity (apparent distance) of each stereo-matched cloud\n\n\nelement to cloud motion and CTH (Zong et al. 2002).\n\n\nIn the analysis, the MISR level-2 wind-corrected cloud-\n\n\ntop-height product (Moroney et al. 2002; Davies et al.\n\n\n2007) is used. The MISR CTHs have a horizontal reso-\n\n\nlution of 1 3 1 km2 and a nominal accuracy of 6560 m\n\n\n(Moroney et al. 2002). For low-level clouds the statisti-\n\n\ncal error is smaller, approximately 6300 m (Naud et al.\n\n\n2004; Garay et al. 2008). The MISR CTHs are extracted\n\n\nfor 38 latitude 3 48 longitude boxes centered at the\n\n\ntransect grid points, and only cloud tops below 3000 m\n\n\nare considered. The number of MISR orbits during JJA\n\n\n2003 with good registration quality varies between 12\n\n\nand 23 for the individual transect boxes (rightmost\n\n\nnumbers in Fig. 1). Because of problems in retriev-\n\n\ning good-quality cloud movement vectors (winds), the\n\n\nnumber of passages with wind-corrected CTHs is lower.\n\n\nWell-organized cloud scenes with sufficient contrast\n\n\nare favorable conditions for successful retrieval of cloud\n\n\nmotion (Moroney et al. 2002). Scenes with relatively\n\n\nhomogenous stratocumulus decks or scattered trade wind\n\n\ncumuli thus pose more of a challenge for the retrieval\n\n\nalgorithm. This is illustrated in the lower number of orbits\n\n\nwith retrieved wind-corrected low CTHs (,3000 m),\n\n\nwhich varies between 5 and 19 along the transect (left-\n\n\nmost numbers in Fig. 1). Because the cloud-movement\n\n\nretrieval is sensitive to the cloud scene itself, a potential\n\n\ncloud-sampling bias cannot be excluded. The descending\n\n\nnode\u2019s equatorial crossing time for the sun-synchronous\n\n\nTerra satellite is about 1030 local solar time. The tem-\n\n\nporal sampling unfortunately rules out analysis of the\n\n\ndiurnal cycle. One advantage with the MISR instrument\n\n\nis the stereophotogrammetric cloud-top height retrieval,\n\n\nwhich, in contrast to infrared instruments, requires no\n\n\ninformation on the atmospheric state (Garay et al. 2008).\n\n\nWith the relatively fine horizontal resolution of the in-\n\n\nstrument comes a limited spatial coverage.\n\n\n1848 J O U R N A L O F A P P L I E D M E T E O R O L O G Y A N D C L I M A T O L O G Y VOLUME 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious studies have shown the retrieved MISR CTHs\n\n\nto be in good agreement with in situ observations in the\n\n\nstratocumulus regime (Garay et al. 2008) and with other\n\n\nremote sensing data in the trade wind cumulus regime\n\n\n(Genkova et al. 2007).\n\n\nFor the comparison with the GPCI model results,\n\n\nMISR CTHs are converted to pressure by using reanal-\n\n\nysis data from the National Centers for Environmental\n\n\nPrediction (NCEP; Kalnay et al. 1996). First, the spatial\n\n\naverage MISR CTHs are calculated for the 38 3 48 cross-\n\n\nsectional boxes. The NCEP geopotential and temperature\n\n\nfields are then interpolated bilinearly to be representative\n\n\nat the transect point. Third, the MISR cloud-top pressure is\n\n\nderived by assuming a constant lapse rate and hydrostatic\n\n\nbalance between the NCEP reanalysis levels that enclose\n\n\nthe mean MISR CTHs.\n\n\n2) THE ATMOSPHERIC INFRARED SOUNDER\n\n\nWith more than 2000 spectral channels, the AIRS in-\n\n\nstrument provides information on the vertical distribu-\n\n\ntion of water vapor and temperature (and thus relative\n\n\nhumidity) in the atmosphere (Aumann et al. 2003; Chahine\n\n\net al. 2006). The AIRS instrument is on board the polar-\n\n\norbiting sun-synchronous Aqua satellite, which crosses\n\n\nthe equator at approximately 1330 and 0130 local solar\n\n\ntime on the ascending and descending node, respec-\n\n\ntively. In this study we use the horizontally gridded,\n\n\ndaily, level-3, standard retrieval, version-4.0 data on\n\n\npressure levels. The pressure levels located in the lower\n\n\ntroposphere and considered in this analysis are 1000,\n\n\n925, 850, and 700 hPa. Over the ocean, the AIRS re-\n\n\ntrievals have been validated to be accurate within 1 K\n\n\nfor 1-km-layer averages and to 15% for 2-km-layer aver-\n\n\nages for temperature and humidity, respectively (Fetzer\n\n\n2005).\n\n\nFetzer et al. (2004) utilized AIRS retrievals to de-\n\n\nscribe the subsidence-related temperature inversion and\n\n\nthe height-resolved water vapor field over the subtrop-\n\n\nical Pacific Ocean. The temperature inversions showed\n\n\ngood agreement with ECMWF model analyses, and, rel-\n\n\native to operational radiosondes in the region, the height-\n\n\nresolved moisture field showed small biases in the lower\n\n\ntroposphere.\n\n\nAs also discussed in Fetzer et al. (2004), two issues\n\n\nshould be taken into consideration when using AIRS\n\n\ndata to study the lower troposphere. First, the AIRS re-\n\n\ntrieval accuracy is sensitive to the cloud cover and only\n\n\nfor infrared effective cloud fractions (i.e., the emissivity\n\n\nmultiplied by the cloud fraction) of less than 70% is the\n\n\nretrieval successful. This evidently has implications for\n\n\nthe yield in regions of extensive cloudiness. The biased\n\n\nsampling related to the cloud cover sensitivity of the\n\n\nAIRS retrievals has been shown to introduce a moist\n\n\nbias in terms of the total precipitable water vapor\n\n\n(PWV) in the stratocumulus regions (Fetzer et al. 2006).\n\n\nIn the subtropics, which are characterized by dry free-\n\n\ntropospheric air, the PWV is expected to be indicative of\n\n\nthe height of the well-mixed MBL. The moist bias in\n\n\nterms of PWV in the AIRS data for the stratocumulus\n\n\nregions could then imply that the biased sampling to-\n\n\nward smaller cloudiness is associated with an over-\n\n\nsampling of relatively deeper MBL. Second, the coarse\n\n\nvertical resolution of the AIRS dataset rules out analysis\n\n\nof finer vertical structures. The ECMWF analyses as-\n\n\nsimilate radiances from AIRS (McNally et al. 2006).\n\n\nb. Models\n\n\nIn Table 1 the model centers and model versions in-\n\n\ncluded in the analysis are listed. The models that con-\n\n\ntribute data to the GPCI project but do not have all\n\n\nnecessary variables to derive the BLH estimates (a small\n\n\nsubset of all models that contribute data to the GPCI\n\n\nproject) are excluded from the analysis. The model sim-\n\n\nulations were conducted with prescribed SSTs. The sur-\n\n\nface temperature of the ocean is crucial for the evolution\n\n\nof the MBL along the transect. Thus, for a fair compari-\n\n\nson of modeled boundary layer and cloud-height evolu-\n\n\ntion, prescribed SSTs are a necessity. As reference, Fig. 3\n\n\nshows reanalyzed SSTs along the GPCI transect from\n\n\nNCEP. The simulated atmospheric fields are reported as\n\n\n3-hourly snapshots except the radiative and turbulent\n\n\nfluxes, which are reported as 3-h means. The analysis\n\n\nis performed on model levels. The modelers have used\n\n\ndifferent interpolation techniques when reporting the\n\n\ndata at the horizontal points of the transect. The models\n\n\ndo have different horizontal and vertical resolutions;\n\n\nhowever, regardless of these differences all model re-\n\n\nsults are analyzed in the same way.\n\n\nBoth BLH estimates are derived from the model data.\n\n\nIn the process of deriving the low-cloud-top pressure in\n\n\nthe models, the following steps/assumptions are made:\n\n\n1) model levels with gridbox-mean cloud condensate\n\n\nof ,0.01 g kg\n21\n\n\nare treated as cloud free, 2) only low-\n\n\ncloud-top scenes in which no high or medium high\n\n\nclouds are present (.3000 m or ,700 hPa) have been\n\n\nused, 3) the simulated boundary layer clouds have\n\n\nbeen assumed to be maximally overlapped when cal-\n\n\nculating cloud-top pressure, and 4) the cloud tops in\n\n\nthe models and in the ECMWF analysis have been\n\n\nassumed to be located at the half-level above the reg-\n\n\nular model level.\n\n\nA threshold on the simulated cloud condensate (step\n\n\n1) is necessary because satellites have a lowest detect-\n\n\nable limit. A couple of models also exhibit \u2018\u2018empty\n\n\nclouds\u2019\u2019\u2014that is, they have cloud fraction but virtually\n\n\nno condensate. The choice of cloud condensate threshold\n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2010 K A R L S S O N E T A L . 1849\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhas little impact on the cloud-top pressure in terms of the\n\n\nacross-model variability and mean model value. How-\n\n\never, the number of identified low-cloud-top scenes\n\n\nis highly sensitive to the choice of cloud condensate\n\n\nthreshold. Using a too-large threshold leads to model\n\n\nlevels being erroneously treated as cloud free and de-\n\n\ncreases the number of low-cloud-top pressures derived.\n\n\nOn the other hand, using a too-small threshold also de-\n\n\ncreases the number of derived low-cloud-top pressures\n\n\nsince a smaller number of optically thin high clouds are\n\n\nfiltered out by the algorithm. The choice of 0.01 g kg21\n\n\noptimizes the number of low-cloud-top scenes identified\n\n\nwhile not increasing the cloud-free scenes. Because high\n\n\ncloud tops (e.g., deep convection towers or frontal and\n\n\ncirrus clouds) are not representative of the boundary\n\n\nlayer, these are excluded from the analysis (step 2). For\n\n\nthe remaining cloud scenes\u2014those containing low clouds\n\n\nwith enough condensate\u2014the mean cloud-top pressure\n\n\npcloud is derived, assuming the clouds reported at the\n\n\nmodel levels to be maximally overlapped:\n\n\np\ncloud\n\n\n5\n\n\n?\nn\n\n\ni51\n( f\n\n\ni\n? fmax\n\n\ni\n)p\n\n\ni\nd\n\n\ni\n\n\n?\nn\n\n\ni51\n( f\n\n\ni\n? fmax\n\n\ni\n)d\n\n\ni\n\n\n0\n\n\nd\ni\n5 0, f\n\n\ni\n# fmax\n\n\ni\nd\n\n\ni\n5 1, f\n\n\ni\n. fmax\n\n\ni\n\n\n?\n\n\nfmax\ni\n5 0, i 5 1\n\n\nfmax\ni11\n\n\n5 f\ni\n, f\n\n\ni\n. fmax\n\n\ni\n\n\n? ,\n\n\nwhere fi is the cloud fraction at model level i, fmaxi is the\n\n\nlargest model level cloud fraction, pi is the pressure of\n\n\nthe model half-level, and di is a unit step function, which\n\n\nis unity if the model level cloud fraction exceeds the\n\n\npreviously largest cloud fraction and zero otherwise.\n\n\nThe sums are calculated from above; the lower bound of\n\n\nsummation (i 5 1) thus corresponds to the uppermost\n\n\nmodel half-level below 700 hPa (;3000 m) classified as\n\n\ncloudy, and the upper bound of summation (i 5 n)\n\n\ncorresponds to the model level closest to the surface. For\n\n\nexample, a scene with a cloud fraction of 30% at 800 hPa\n\n\nand of 50% at 900 hPa results in a mean cloud-top pres-\n\n\nsure of 840 hPa while a scene with a cloud fraction of 50%\n\n\nat 800 hPa and of 30% at 900 hPa results in a mean cloud-\n\n\ntop pressure of 800 hPa.\n\n\nThe BLH estimate based on the height of the maxi-\n\n\nmum vertical RH gradient with respect to pressure is\n\n\nderived in the following way.

Results and discussion\n\n\nThe vertical distributions of all 1 3 1 km2 MISR\n\n\nCTHs retrieved during JJA 2003 for the northern part of\n\n\nthe transect (328\u2013208N) are shown in Fig. 4. This part of\n\n\nthe GPCI transect comprises the region of solid stratus\n\n\nas well as where the stratus-to-cumulus transition (SCT)\n\n\nin general occurs. The distributions have been normal-\n\n\nized by the total number of samples at each transect\n\n\npoint. The mean cloud-top height increases as one moves\n\n\nsouthward, from 969 m at 328N to 1806 m at 208N. This\n\n\nindicates a comparable increase in the mean BLH since\n\n\nthe cloud-top height is expected, at least in the stratocu-\n\n\nmulus region, to coincide with the subsidence inversion\n\n\nand thus represent the BLH. While the mean cloud-top\n\n\nheight increases southward, the distributions also widen\n\n\nduring the SCT (Fig. 4), indicative of a weakening of\n\n\nthe subsidence inversion and warmer SSTs enhancing\n\n\nthe turbulent surface fluxes and convective updrafts. Al-\n\n\nthough the seasonal trend in SST during the analyzed\n\n\nperiod is larger in the northern part of the GPCI transect\n\n\n(Fig. 3), possibly implying a similar behavior of the CTH\n\n\nvariability, the widening of the distributions (Fig. 4)\n\n\nrather indicates that more convective situations are as-\n\n\nsociated with larger variability.\n\n\nThe fact that the distributions tend to be multimodal is\n\n\npartly attributable to temporal variability in the retrieved\n\n\nCTHs between different MISR overpasses (not shown).\n\n\nThis is especially true for the 238 and 208N points (Fig. 4),\n\n\nwhich only have a modest number of overpasses (5 and 7,\n\n\nrespectively) with retrieved wind-corrected CTHs. For\n\n\nthe boxes centered at 328, 298, and 268N the numbers of\n\n\nsatellite passages with retrieved wind-corrected CTHs\n\n\nduring JJA 2003 are 16, 15, and 14, respectively (see\n\n\nleftmost numbers in Fig. 1). Multilayer cloud scenes are\n\n\na challenge for the MISR wind retrieval (Moroney et al.\n\n\n2002), and an increased number of these events at 238 and\n\n\n208N as well as a smaller number of good-quality orbits\n\n\ncould be the reason why fewer overpasses have wind-\n\n\ncorrected CTHs.\n\n\nFigure 5a shows the modeled and observed BLH es-\n\n\ntimate based on the pressure at which the maximum\n\n\nvertical RH gradient with respect to pressure is found as\n\n\na function of latitude along the transect. In Fig. 5b the\n\n\nlatitudinal evolution of the BLH estimate in each of\n\n\nthe individual models is shown. All individual models,\n\n\nthe ECMWF analysis, and the AIRS data show an ex-\n\n\npected southward increase in this BLH estimate from\n\n\n358 to 208N. This is also the part of the transect where the\n\n\nmost solid cloud deck is found (cloud cover above 50%;\n\n\nsee Fig. 1) and where the stratus-to-cumulus transition is\n\n\nexpected to take place. The median-model ensemble\n\n\nvalue shows a good agreement with the ECMWF anal-\n\n\nysis in this region (and with AIRS from 358 to around\n\n\n258N), where the BLH evolves, according to the vertical\n\n\nlocation of the main RH inversion, from around 950 hPa\n\n\nat 358N to around 850 hPa at 208N. These values are\n\n\nconsistent with previous observational estimates from in\n\n\nsitu measurements (Schubert et al. 1995) and GPS radio\n\n\noccultation satellite observations (von Engeln et al.\n\n\n2005). Despite the apparent good agreement in terms of\n\n\nthe median-model ensemble, the variability between\n\n\nmodels in mean BLH is too large: at places the differ-\n\n\nence between the maximum and minimum model values\n\n\nis as large as the BLH itself.\n\n\nThe median-model BLH estimate based on the RH\n\n\ninversion (Fig. 5a) decreases southward from 188N and\n\n\nreaches a minimum at the ITCZ, which during the an-\n\n\nalyzed period is located around 58\u2013108N. However, a\n\n\ncouple of models as well as the ECMWF analysis show\n\n\na fairly constant BLH from 188N to the ITCZ (Fig. 5b).\n\n\nAn important characteristic of the evolution of BLH\n\n\nis the fact that there is little change south of around 208N\n\n\nin the ECMWF analysis, AIRS, and a couple of models.\n\n\nAgain this is consistent with some previous observations\n\n\n(von Engeln et al. 2005) and was highlighted by Schubert\n\n\net al. (1995) to contrast previous perceptions of a more\n\n\ndramatic deepening of the trade wind inversion equa-\n\n\ntorward (see, e.g., Fig. 14.7 in Emanuel 1994). The lower\n\n\nand close-to-constant values of the BLH south of 208N\n\n\nin the AIRS data (Fig. 5a) can be mostly attributed to\n\n\nthe coarse vertical resolution of this particular dataset\n\n\nversion. The fact that data show the trade wind inversion\n\n\nto be found almost exclusively between 925 and 850 hPa\n\n\nFIG. 3. NCEP SSTs along the transect during JJA 2003.

A preliminary case study in the trade wind boundary\n\n\nlayer shows that it is possible to improve the retrieved\n\n\nvertical structure of temperature and RH in the lower\n\n\ntroposphere using the high-vertical-resolution AIRS sup-\n\n\nport retrieval product (J. Martins 2009, personal com-\n\n\nmunication). However, a more extensive analysis of the\n\n\nAIRS support retrieval product is outside the scope of\n\n\nthis study.\n\n\nNote that, while models show different evolutions of\n\n\nthe BLH estimate based on the height of the main RH\n\n\ninversion, all models and observations agree in a de-\n\n\ncrease of the RH inversion strength toward the ITCZ\n\n\n(not shown).\n\n\nThe model median and ECMWF analysis temporal\n\n\nvariability of the BLH estimate show good agreement\n\n\nalong the transect (Fig. 5c). The increase of variability\n\n\ntoward the ITCZ is likely a combination of weaker\n\n\nsubsidence inversions and a larger variability in the\n\n\nstrength of the convective updrafts. The southward de-\n\n\ncrease in the seasonal cycle amplitude of the prescribed\n\n\nSSTs (Fig. 3) is not reflected in the variability of the\n\n\nBLH estimate based on the RH gradient. The differ-\n\n\nences between the models in terms of the temporal\n\n\nvariability of the BLH is again substantial and is a cause\n\n\nfor concern, with some models showing variability\n\n\nvalues that are almost 5 times as large as others. Ac-\n\n\ncording to AIRS, variability of the RH-based BLH es-\n\n\ntimate is, more or less, nonexistent south of 208N (Fig.\n\n\n5c). This is most likely attributable to the coarse vertical\n\n\nresolution of the AIRS dataset, although the absence of\n\n\ndiurnal variability in the AIRS data also should con-\n\n\ntribute to the lower variability.\n\n\nThe simulated and observed BLH estimates based on\n\n\nlow-cloud-top height are shown in Fig. 6. Described\n\n\npreviously in section 2a(1), MISR 1 3 1 km2 low CTHs\n\n\nare spatially averaged over 38 3 48 boxes centered at the\n\n\ntransect points (Fig. 1) for a more fair comparison with\n\n\nthe model data. The median model, the ECMWF anal-\n\n\nysis, and the MISR data all show an increase in CTH\n\n\nfrom 358 to 208N (Fig. 6a), in line with the RH inversion\n\n\nestimate. In a stratocumulus-topped MBL the two BLH\n\n\nestimates are expected to coincide because the vertical\n\n\ngrowth of the cloud is limited by the inversion. Ac-\n\n\ncording to the ECMWF analysis and the model median\n\n\nthe cloud-top height then increases farther south of 208N\n\n\nto the ITCZ (;58\u2013108N). This is in contrast to the MISR\n\n\nresults that instead show a decrease in low-level CTH\n\n\nfor the same stretch of the transect. The region from\n\n\n208N to the ITCZ is typically associated with trade wind\n\n\ncumuli and deep convection. We speculate that the CTH\n\n\ndecrease seen in the MISR data is connected to the\n\n\ndecoupling of the MBL and the transition to a cumulus-\n\n\ntopped boundary layer. When the MBL becomes de-\n\n\ncoupled, a weakly stable transition layer separates the\n\n\nsurface mixed layer from the layer capped by the sub-\n\n\nsidence inversion. A large majority of the convective\n\n\nplumes do not have enough energy to reach the sub-\n\n\nsidence inversion. This results in a multitude of small\n\n\ncumuli with cloud tops below the subsidence inversion.\n\n\nA small number of more energetic convective plumes\n\n\nmanage to penetrate through the transition layer and\n\n\nreach the subsidence inversion and above. This pre-\n\n\ndominance of relatively shallow and small cumuli with\n\n\ncloud tops beneath the subsidence inversion has been\n\n\ndocumented in several recent studies (e.g., Genkova\n\n\net al. 2007; Zhao and Di Girolamo 2007). The discrep-\n\n\nancy between the MISR and the model and analysis\n\n\nresults (Fig. 6a) probably illustrates the essential dif-\n\n\nference between what is being observed by MISR and\n\n\nwhat is being simulated by the models and the ECMWF\n\n\nanalysis. The models (and the ECMWF analysis) are\n\n\ntrying to represent cloud cover and mean liquid water\n\n\ncontent in grid boxes with sizes on the order of 100 3\n\n\n100 km2. On the other hand, MISR CTHs retrievals\n\n\nFIG. 4.

In prac-\n\n\ntice, it appears that the models (and the ECMWF\n\n\nanalysis) are mostly capturing a CTH that roughly cor-\n\n\nresponds to the top of the boundary layer while MISR is\n\n\nable to capture a variety of cumulus cloud tops with\n\n\na mean that is below the boundary layer depth. Note,\n\n\nhowever, that this could also partly be an artifact of too\n\n\nfew satellite passages with wind-retrieved low cloud tops.\n\n\nThe CTH temporal variability of the models and the\n\n\nECMWF analysis is in relatively good agreement with\n\n\nthe MISR observations (Fig. 6c). There is a weaker\n\n\nlatitudinal dependence on the variability of the BLH\n\n\nestimate based on CTH than is the case for the RH\n\n\ngradient estimate. The variability is also in general smaller\n\n\nfor the low-cloud-top pressure than for the BLH estimate\n\n\nbased on the RH gradient. There is an interesting de-\n\n\npendence on the cloud regimes: in the stratocumulus re-\n\n\ngion the variability in the height of the RH inversion and\n\n\nCTH is very similar, with values of around 30\u201340 hPa,\n\n\nwhereas in the deep convection regions the variability\n\n\nof the RH inversion height is almost 2 times the corre-\n\n\nsponding values for the CTH.\n\n\nFigure 7 shows mean versus temporal variability (1\n\n\nstandard deviation) of the two BLH estimates at dif-\n\n\nferent points along the transect for the individual models\n\n\nand observations. The mean model variability for both\n\n\nBLH estimates increases toward the ITCZ (;58\u2013108N),\n\n\nand the across-model spread shows the same tendency.\n\n\nIn the region typically associated with stratus clouds, the\n\n\nmodels show internal consistency and better agreement\n\n\nwith the observations with respect to the mean and the\n\n\ntemporal variability of both BLH estimates when com-\n\n\npared with regions associated with trade wind cumulus\n\n\nand deep convection. The ECMWF analysis mean and\n\n\nvariability of the BLH estimates stay relatively close to\n\n\nthe model mean values. As discussed earlier, because of\n\n\nthe poor vertical resolution of the dataset AIRS is not\n\n\nable to produce realistic results because of poor reso-\n\n\nlution in the cumulus- and deep convection\u2013dominated\n\n\nregions.\n\n\nFIG. 5.

The different shades of gray\n\n\nof the markers indicate the geographical location of the\n\n\npoints along the GPCI transect. Data points on the right\n\n\n(left) side of the 1-to-1 line indicate that the mean cloud-\n\n\ntop height is below (above) the main RH inversion.\n\n\nFrom the diagram it is evident that the estimates show\n\n\nbetter agreement in the northern (stratocumulus) part\n\n\nof the transect (darker shades of gray), both for models\n\n\nand for observations. Here, the majority of the models\n\n\nproduce CTHs at a slightly lower altitude than inversion\n\n\nheights, which is what is expected for a stratocumulus-\n\n\ntopped MBL. At lower latitudes where convective\n\n\nupdrafts are more important for maintaining the MBL\n\n\nand the subsidence inversion is significantly weaker,\n\n\na majority of the models depict CTHs that extend higher\n\n\nthan the height of the main vertical RH gradient. This\n\n\nmay well be because of the decrease in the altitude of\n\n\nthe main RH inversion that most models appear to have\n\n\nin the deep convection region (Figs. 5a,b), which is\n\n\nnot consistent with previous observations or with the\n\n\nECMWF analysis. In the presence of boundary layers\n\n\nthat are not well mixed, the cloud-base RH inversion\n\n\nmay be comparable in strength to that of the boundary\n\n\nlayer inversion (e.g., Zeng et al. 2004). This could be the\n\n\nreason why several models show a decrease in the alti-\n\n\ntude of the main RH inversion equatorward where the\n\n\nsubsidence inversion weakens. A few models show the\n\n\nopposite behavior, placing the low cloud tops at a lower\n\n\naltitude than the main RH inversion (Fig. 8). In the\n\n\nparticular case of the ECMWF analysis, the two esti-\n\n\nmates, CTH and BLH, show a remarkably good agree-\n\n\nment along the whole stretch of the transect. Although it\n\n\nwould be nice to assume that this is a realistic behavior,\n\n\nit is still not clear how many of the characteristics of the\n\n\nECMWF analysis are model dependent (as opposed to\n\n\nrelying fundamentally on the observations being as-\n\n\nsimilated). In this context, it is important to remind the\n\n\nreader that very few of the observations being assimi-\n\n\nlated in the ECMWF analysis have a direct impact on\n\n\nthe tropical and subtropical cloudy boundary layer over\n\n\nthe ocean. In particular, 1) there are virtually no radio-\n\n\nsonde observations in the region, 2) the infrared sounding\n\n\ninformation being assimilated is for noncloudy (clear)\n\n\nsituations, and 3) the sensitivity of infrared and micro-\n\n\nwave observations to the cloudy boundary layer vertical\n\n\nstructure is negligible.\n\n\nFIG. 6.

Summary and conclusions\n\n\nIn the framework of GPCI (Teixeira et al. 2008b,\n\n\nTeixeira et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to J. Climate)\n\n\nwe analyze the boundary layer height evolution in models\n\n\nand observations in a situation in which the lower atmo-\n\n\nsphere is advected, by the prevailing northeasterly trade\n\n\nwinds, from a typically stratocumulus-topped MBL off\n\n\nthe coast of California to a trade cumulus\u2013topped MBL\n\n\nand farther south to the deep convective regions of the\n\n\nITCZ.\n\n\nIn this study, satellite-based observations are utilized\n\n\nto estimate the boundary layer height over this remote\n\n\nocean area. From these datasets, two proxies for bound-\n\n\nary layer height have been defined: 1) the pressure at the\n\n\nlevel at which the maximum vertical gradient (with re-\n\n\nspect to pressure) of RH is found and 2) the cloud-top\n\n\npressure of low clouds. These estimates enable a rela-\n\n\ntively straightforward comparison between models and\n\n\nsatellite observations. AIRS and MISR retrievals have\n\n\nbeen used as a satellite record for the proxies based\n\n\non the RH inversion and low-cloud-top pressure, re-\n\n\nspectively. Analysis results from ECMWF for the area\n\n\nare also used in this context. The period studied is June\u2013\n\n\nAugust 2003.\n\n\nThe observational data and the models, including the\n\n\nECMWF analysis, clearly show an increase in boundary\n\n\nlayer height (most pronounced in the northernmost\n\n\npart) along the GPCI transect from the stratocumulus\n\n\nregions toward the equator. The two observational es-\n\n\ntimates agree well on the magnitude of the depth of the\n\n\nboundary layer in the stratocumulus region and the\n\n\nintermodel variability as well as that the observational\n\n\nvariability is the smallest in this region. Farther south,\n\n\nthe two methods of estimating the boundary layer height\n\n\nshow less agreement. Most likely, the AIRS data un-\n\n\nderestimate the boundary layer height south of 208N,\n\n\nwith very little variability (mainly because of a lack of\n\n\nvertical resolution of this particular AIRS product),\n\n\nwhereas the MISR data depict a decrease in cloud-top\n\n\nheight to the shallowest observed layers close to the\n\n\nequator. We speculate that the different evolution in the\n\n\nCTH of MISR, the models, and the ECMWF analysis\n\n\nsouth of 208N highlights the difference in what is being\n\n\nobserved by MISR and what is being simulated by\n\n\nthe models and the ECMWF analysis.

The models show more variability in the\n\n\nboundary layer height estimate based on the RH in-\n\n\nversion than in the estimate defined from the low-cloud-\n\n\ntop height. A possible reason for the larger variability in\n\n\nthe RH inversion\u2013based estimate might be that it oscil-\n\n\nlates between the subsidence inversion and a potentially\n\n\nstrong cloud-base RH inversion that may be present in\n\n\nboundary layers that are not well mixed. When advected\n\n\nsouthward along the transect, the air experiences in-\n\n\ncreased buoyancy fluxes, eventually creating a convective\n\n\nbackground state. In practice, models have different\n\n\nparameterizations for different types of clouds and dif-\n\n\nferent rules for when and how these parameterizations\n\n\nare combined. For convective situations the interplay of\n\n\nparameterizations in distributing the buoyant energy is\n\n\nimportant for the state of the boundary layer. The lesser\n\n\nagreement between models in the region typically associ-\n\n\nated with shallow cumulus and cumulus might thus be\n\n\nrelated to a more complex and subjective interplay of the\n\n\nincreased number of parameterizations contributing to the\n\n\nvertical redistribution of humidity and temperature for\n\n\natmospheric states in which deep convection might occur.\n\n\nThe fact that the growth of the MBL along the GPCI\n\n\ntransect depicted from the BLH estimates in both\n\n\nmodels and observations is less dramatic agrees with\n\n\nthe result of Schubert et al. (1995) rather than previous\n\n\nideas, suggesting a steeper increase in the height of the\n\n\nMBL from the trade wind cumulus region to the ITCZ\n\n\n(e.g., Emanuel 1994, see his Fig. 14.7).\n\n\nThis study presents feasible methods of how satellite-\n\n\nbased observational techniques can be used for evalu-\n\n\nating the boundary layer height in large-scale models\n\n\nFIG. 8.

Paul Try, as the  \nfirst International GEWEX Proj-\nect Office (IGPO) Director, suc-\nceeded by Rick Lawford, are perhaps \n\n\ntwo of the most intelligent, remarkable, and yet humble \nindividuals I had the pleasure of working with. I learned \nso much from them during these past years that shar-\ning the experiences would fill a book. The energy level of  \nPeter van Oevelen, the new IGPO Director, has not only re-\nenergized me during these last months of my chairmanship, \nbut has also reassured me that the GEWEX community has \nbeen so fortunate as to attract some of the most dedicated \nand talented colleagues to direct the IGPO. While Directors \nand SSG chairs have come and gone, Dawn Erlich has been \nthe anchor and most loyal and caring guardian GEWEX has \nhad over the years. I am also grateful to my assistant, Diane \nHohnbaum at University of California-Irvine for her help \nand service over the past 5 years.\n\n\nNeedless to say, I have also had the pleasure of working with \nan outstanding group of panel and working group chairs \nand hundreds of volunteers, including all the SSG members \nover the years. My thanks go to all of you, and my apologies \nthat I cannot mention everyone by name in this commen-\ntary. (The GEWEX News Editorial Board would not allow \nme the space!)\n\n\nI had the good fortune of becoming the second SSG Chair \nafter a remarkable tenure by our colleague Moustafa \u201cMous\u201d \nChahine of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Under Mous\u2019 lead-\nership the GEWEX program truly flourished, as best docu-\nmented in the GEWEX Phase I (1990\u20132002) report. The  \naccomplishments of our various panels, including widely-used \ndata sets such as the International Satellite Cloud Climatol-\nogy Project (ISCCP) by the GEWEX Radiation Panel (GRP); \ncontributions by the GEWEX Modelling and Prediction \nPanel (GMPP) such as the Project for the Intercomparison \nof Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes and the GEWEX \nCloud System Study; and the accomplishments of the Con-\ntinental-Scale Experiments (CSEs) initiated by the GEWEX \nHydrometeorology Panel (GHP), are just a few examples. \n\n\nWe started Phase II of GEWEX with each of our three panels \n(GRP, GMPP and GHP) to address the critical challenging \n\n\nCommentary\n\n\nReflections on My Term as \nChairman of the GEWEX SSG \n\n\nSoroosh Sorooshian, Ph.D., N.A.E.\nChair, GEWEX Scientific Steering Group\n\n\nscientific questions that were identified in Phase I and the \ninitiation of the Coordinated Enhanced Observation Period \n(CEOP). Most recently, CEOP was merged with GHP and \ntransformed into the new Coordinated Energy Water Cycle \nObservations Project (also CEOP) under the leadership of \nToshio Koike and the late John Roads. \n\n\nPerhaps one of the most interesting experiences of chair-\ning the SSG has been the appreciation I have gained for \nthe wide range of scientific questions and activities that \nthe GEWEX program is addressing. None of us, no mat-\nter how broadly we are educated, can expect to be an ex-\npert in all aspects of the GEWEX program. During the past  \n8 years, even though I have been exposed to a wide range \nof topics under the GEWEX umbrella, in no way can I \nclaim that I have become an expert in all aspects. One thing \nis certain however: the duties of the SSG Chair force one \nto \u201cthink outside the box\u201d (in my case, hydrology). Dur-\ning my term as Chairman, I have heard comments such as \n\u201cGEWEX has become a purely land-hydrology activity\u201d as \nwell as comments from many of my hydrology colleagues \nthat \u201cGEWEX has not paid as much attention to the land-\nhydrology aspects.\u201d For better or worse, the complexities of \nmultidisciplinary projects such as GEWEX require a bal-\nanced approach, and therefore one should not expect an  \noptimal outcome based on one\u2019s disciplinary point of view. \n\n\nThroughout the years we have maintained that GEWEX \nshould \u201cStay the Course\u201d and minimize reorganizing itself \nto focus on the science and observation issues that are the \ncore of the panel activities. I still feel strongly that this is \nthe best approach to produce the desired outcomes; let me \nelaborate using the critical issue of prediction as an example. \nPrediction of future climate scenarios at various scales has \nbeen a key focus of the World Climate Research Programme \n(WCRP) and in more recent years has been highly empha-\nsized. Much of the recent emphasis is perhaps due to the In-\ntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) process. \nWhile the IPCC has mainly focused on climate models at \nthe global scale, it is becoming more apparent that the issue \nof regional-scale predictions will be dominant in the next \nround of IPCC assessments. As a result, any downscaling to \nregional scales will require some degree of testing and vali-\ndation with real data. Therefore, the role for the GEWEX \nprogram is crucial, not only because of its long-term focus \non providing global observations, but also for its role in con-\nducting process and modelling studies at the scales required \nfor the finer spatial and temporal resolutions. \n\n\nOnly time will tell, but I nevertheless predict that the impor-\ntance of the GEWEX program will only grow as we move \nforward into the future. I am sure under the leadership of \nthe incoming chair, Thomas Ackerman, and in cooperation \nwith the WCRP programs, particularly the Climate Vari-\nability and Predictability Project, the GEWEX program will \nremain a core activity that benefits the international com-\nmunity currently faced with addressing the uncertainties \nassociated with the impact of climate change on resources \nsuch as water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nRecent News of Interest\n\n\nCurrently, eight model groups are participating in the \nGEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS) Third \nLarge Eddy Simulation (LES) Case. The case is still open and \nthe deadline for sending in model results has been extended \nto 15 January 2009. Preliminary results will be presented at \nthe American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting on 15\u201319  \nDecember 2008 in San Fransisco, California, USA.

However, when it was realized that the polar orbiting \nsatellite imagers (AVHRR) which serve as the ISCCP radi-\nance calibration reference standard needed to be calibrated \nand monitored, Chris quickly stepped into this key role. The \ncalibration problem was a huge undertaking because of the \nlarge number of radiometers. His work achieved the first, and \nstill only, comprehensive and consistent absolute calibration \nof all the radiometers in the entire constellation of operational \nweather satellites.

The approach used \nby GPCI builds on the EUROpean Cloud Systems Project \n(EUROCS; Siebesma et al., 2004) where weather and cli-\nmate prediction models are analyzed along a Pacific Ocean \ncross section, from the stratocumulus regions off Califor-\nnia, across the shallow convection trade-wind areas, to the \ndeep convection regions of the Intertropical Convergence \nZone. This approach provides a simple framework for 3-di-\nmensional model evaluation that includes several important \ncloud regimes such as stratocumulus and shallow and deep \ncumulus, as well as the transitions between them. The fact \nthat data are needed only along a cross section provides a \ntechnically easier intercomparison. \n\n\nOver 20 weather and climate prediction organizations partic-\nipated during the first phase of GCPI and submitted model \noutput, including: the National Center for Atmospheric Re-\nsearch (NCAR), the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-\nistration /Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Geophysi-\ncal Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, the National Centers for \nEnvironmental Prediction, the European Centre for Me-\ndium-range Weather Forecasts, the United Kingdom Me-\nteorological Office (UKMO), MeteoFrance, the Japanese \nMeteorological Agency, and the Max Planck Institute for \nMeteorology. Instantaneous model output was collected ev-\nery 3 hours for the periods of June\u2013August 1998 and 2003, \nwhich allowed for detailed studies on the temporal variabil-\nity of cloud properties. \n\n\nThe first results and model evaluation were presented at a \njoint GPCI and GCSS Boundary Layer Cloud Working \n\n\nGroup workshop in September 2006. A comparison of \nmonthly mean properties between models and observations \nshowed that although most models often suffer from similar \nproblems (e.g., negative stratocumulus cloud bias and posi-\ntive shallow cumulus cloud bias) they also have quite dif-\nferent characteristics (e.g., the depth of the boundary layer \nevolving from a low to a high sea surface temperature region \ncan be substantially different from model to model).\n\n\nAlso, histograms of cloud cover along the cross section dif-\nfered from model to model. The figure at the top of page 1 \nshows that some climate models (e.g., UKMO/HadGAM) \nexhibit a quasi-bimodal structure with cloud cover being \neither close to 100 percent or close to zero, while other cli-\nmate models (e.g., NCAR/CAM3) show a more continuous \ntransition. The GEWEX International Satellite Cloud Cli-\nmatology Project (ISCCP) observations showed results that \nare somewhere between these two extreme behaviors. These \npatterns reflect the different nature of the cloud, convection \nand boundary layer parameterizations, with some models \nbasing their parameterizations on the idea of distinct regimes \n(with the consequent sharp transitions between them) while \nothers base their parameterizations in climatological values. \n\n\nGPCI is now entering Phase II, where the models are to be \nconfronted along the GPCI transection with cloud obser-\nvations derived from new satellite products. Model results \nhave been submitted for June\u2013July\u2013August 2003 and are be-\ning evaluated with a number of satellite products including \nthe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)-derived tempera-\nture and humidity data, and cloud-top heights derived from \nthe Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer. \n\n\nThe combination of infrared and microwave radiances us-\ning AIRS and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit and \nHumidity Sounder for Brazil allows the retrieval of high \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nGEWEX and WGNE Join Forces \non Parameterization \n\n\nChristian Jakob1 and Martin Miller2\n1Chair, GEWEX Modelling and Prediction Panel, Monash \nUniversity, Victoria, Australia; 2Chair, Working Group on \nNumerical Experimentation, European Centre for Medium-\nrange Weather Forecasts, Berkshire, United Kingdom\n\n\nFor many years the GEWEX Modelling and Prediction \nPanel (GMPP) and the Working Group on Numerical Ex-\nperimentation (WGNE) have successfully collaborated on \nthe development and evaluation of the representation of \nsubgrid scale processes in terms of larger-scale parameters, \n(i.e., parameterization for atmospheric and land-surface \nmodels). A recent initiative, described below, has strength-\nened this collaboration further by bringing the two groups \neven closer together and aligning their activities.\n\n\nBackground\nGEWEX has a long tradition in research, observations, \nand modelling of the global water and energy cycles, where \nparameterization science features strongly. Most of the \nGEWEX parameterization development activities are facili-\ntated in the groups of GMPP, namely the GEWEX Cloud \nSystem Study (GCSS), the GEWEX Land/Atmosphere \nSystem Study (GLASS), and the GEWEX Atmospheric \nBoundary Layer Study (GABLS). Over the past decade or \nso, these groups have changed the research landscape in \ntheir respective areas by developing unique approaches to \nparameterizations and the means by which they are evalu-\nated, which are now widely adopted in the community. \nDespite these successes, some of which have gone relatively \nunnoticed, a feeling has emerged that interest and activities \nin the development of parameterizations for atmospheric \nmodels is somehow in decline. \n\n\nMany of the processes that are important to weather and  \nclimate act on scales smaller than the grid-sizes of contempo-\nrary models used in numerical weather prediction (NWP), \nseasonal prediction and climate simulation. Examples of \nsuch processes are turbulence and convection in both the \natmosphere and the ocean, cloud processes, and processes \nrelated to the energy, water and biogeochemical exchanges \nat land and ocean surfaces. As these processes affect the evo-\nlution of the Earth System on all time-scales, they need to be \nrepresented in models\u2014this is usually achieved by means of \nparameterization. It is generally accepted that the key defi-\nciencies, and hence uncertainties, in our current climate pro-\njections are directly related to our ability to represent these \nparametrized processes. Modern parameterizations are com-\nprised of conceptual models of the processes they are aiming \nto represent. Importantly, this extends their usefulness well \nbeyond the application in a model, as the conceptualization \nof a process requires a deep understanding of the important \nmechanisms and feedbacks. It can be argued that in many \nareas the need for improved parameterizations has driven \nresearch progress such as in the design and implementation \nof both field experiments and research satellites. \n\n\nParticipants at the 24th Meeting of the Working Group on Numerical \nExperimentation (WGNE), Montreal, Canada, 3-7 November 2008.\n\n\nresolution temperature and humidity profiles for infrared \ncloud fraction (the product of emissivity and coverage) up \nto about 70 percent. The AIRS retrievals have a nominal \n45 km horizontal spacing. Standard retrieved products in-\nclude surface temperature, infrared cloud fraction, cloud \ntop temperatures and pressures, and profiles of temperature \nand water vapor. The vertical resolution of the AIRS system \nis specified as 1 km for temperature and 2 km for water va-\npor in the troposphere. The actual resolution may be better, \nand some results suggest sensitivity to sub-kilometer tem-\nperature structure under certain conditions. AIRS achieves \naccuracies of 1 degree Kelvin per kilometer in temperature \nand 10 percent per 2 km in relative humidity.\n\n\nThe figure on page 4 shows two relative humidity cross sec-\ntions along the GPCI transection from AIRS and the NCAR \nclimate model for June\u2013July\u2013August 2003. It is clear that \ncompared to AIRS the NCAR model produces a boundary \nlayer that is unrealistically shallow. This is a result that has \nbeen confirmed by other sources. Major differences above \nthe boundary layer may also be due to sampling issues re-\nlated to the AIRS data. \n\n\nFinally, in order to incorporate Cloudsat and Cloud-Aero-\nsol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations \n(CALIPSO) cloud data, it is planned to extract data from \nthese instruments for the June-July-August period of 2008 \nalong the transection, together with GPCI Phase II model \nsimulations.\n\n\nAll GPCI model data are available at the Data Integration \nModel Evalulation (DIME) web site (http://gcss-dime.giss.\nnasa.gov/gpci/modsim_gpci.html), where users may intercom-\npare individual models with observations. GPCI is partially \nsupported by the NASA Modelling, Analysis, and Predic-\ntion (MAP) Program.\n\n\nReference\nSiebesma, A. P., et al., 2004. Cloud representation in general circulation \nmodels over the Northern Pacific Ocean: A EUROCS intercomparison \nstudy. Quart. J. Roy. Meteor. Soc. 103, 3245\u20133268. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nRecent decades have seen great advances in both comput-\ning and model design, leading to the application of mod-\nels with smaller and smaller grid-sizes, particularly in the \nNWP area. Limited-area NWP models are now routinely \nused at grid-sizes well below 10 kilometers. These grid-\nsizes begin to approach scales where certain processes that \nhave traditionally been parametrized can be resolved by \nthe model. Perhaps the prime example for such a process \nis that of atmospheric deep convection. This development \nhas led to the erroneous impression in some quarters that \nparameterizations, in particular those of deep convection, \ndo not require much further development as they will be-\ncome obsolete in the foreseeable future. \n\n\nWhile it is likely that a small number of research activi-\nties will employ global models of high enough resolu-\ntion to be able to abandon the parameterization of deep \nconvection, it is highly unlikely that even the most ad-\nvanced prediction centers will be routinely using models \nof such resolution for several decades to come. This is \nparticularly true for efforts in medium- and extended-\nrange prediction as well as climate prediction and simu-\nlation, where the requirements of ensemble methods will \nprohibit the use of such high-resolution models. Even \nwhere these can be used, the parameterization of pro-\ncesses other than deep convection will remain of crucial \nimportance to climate research.\n\n\nIn contrast to the great advances in computing and general \nmodel development, the scientific field of parameteriza-\ntion development has not advanced correspondingly, least \nof all for key moist processes such as clouds and convec-\ntion. There are a number of likely reasons for this. Param-\neterization research requires a team effort where all aspects \nof development are covered in a holistic manner. It needs \nto be embedded in a global or limited area modelling ef-\nfort to ensure that the work is relevant and practicable in \nthe context of the overall model development. This makes \nit difficult to establish sustainable efforts away from large \nmodelling centers and, with only a few notable exceptions, \nmany centers have reduced their relative efforts in param-\neterization in recent years. \n\n\nIt is likely that the perceived weaknesses in progress also \ncomes from a lack of visibility and promotion of param-\neterization research through relevant international organiza-\ntions. In the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), \nparameterization development activities have a relatively \nlow profile and are mostly concentrated in GMPP, which in \nitself is a modest component of one of several large WCRP \nprojects. The research efforts of the World Meteorological \nOrganization (WMO) on weather prediction, which are co-\nordinated by the Comission for Atmospheric Science (CAS), \nhave had relatively few specific parameterization efforts. It \nhas been through the strong collaboration of GMPP with \nWGNE that parameterization development was connected \nto the main NWP and global models. Given the current \nand future importance of parameterization to ALL applica-\ntions used in the many WCRP and CAS programmes, it is \n\n\nnotable how little visibility and support has been given to \nparameterization development. \n\n\nNew Plan for Parameterization Activities\nGiven the arguments outlined above, it is suggested that it \nis time to rethink the organization of parameterization de-\nvelopment in the various WMO activities, with the specific \naims of:\n\n\n(1) re-establishing parameterization development as \nan important scientific discipline; \n\n\n(2) promoting throughout all WMO research program-\nmes the need for additional investment in param-\neterization development; \n\n\n(3) facilitating the necessary dialogue between param-\netrization developers and model users in all areas \nof model application; \n\n\n(4) facilitating scientific activities, such as coordinated \nresearch programmes, workshops, and scientific \nconferences on parameterization; \n\n\n(5) embracing parameterization development as an \nimportant contribution to enhance our predictive \ncapabilities on all space and time-scales; and \n\n\n(6) building a critical mass within the WMO structure \nto make significant progress in critical areas of par-\nameterization development over the next 10 years.\n\n\nTo achieve these ambitious aims, it was agreed that it would \nbe best to form one central, highly visible parameterization \nexpert group within WMO. As WGNE provides links to all \nmodelling communities from weather to climate, the most \nnatural place for the parameterization expert team is under \nits auspices. The parameterization group will engage with all \nprojects and working groups and aims to become the focal \npoint for parameterization development within WMO and \nthe community it represents. As this new group adds substan-\ntially to WGNE\u2019s portfolio, a new WGNE co-chair with spe-\ncific responsibility for the parameterization activities has been \nappointed. The membership of the expert group is drawn \nfrom existing groups within WCRP and CAS and the cur-\nrent chairs of the GEWEX projects GMPP, GCSS, GLASS \nand GABLS. It is a stated aim of the group to investigate and \nencourage the inclusion of parameterization efforts beyond \nthe atmosphere and land surface, such as the ocean and the \ncryosphere, to enable cross-fertilization of concepts.\n\n\nWhile the reorganization of parameterization research in it-\nself is unlikely to bring about the required reinvigoration of \nthis important area of modelling, it can serve as a launch \nplatform. It is our sincere hope that the wider research and \napplications community will embrace this effort and make \noptimal use of it by engaging with and supporting param-\neterization developers. This is crucial if the improved models \ncalled for by all user communities are to be developed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nRAMI4PILPS: \nAssessing Shortwave Radiation Fluxes in \n\n\nLand Surface Schemes\n\n\nJean-Luc Widlowski1, Kendal McGuffie2 and Bernard Pinty1\n1European Commission, Directorate General Joint Research \nCentre, Institute for Environment and Sustainability, Ispra, Italy;\n2University of Technology, Sydney, Australia\n\n\nRemotely sensed information about crucial surface properties\u2014\nsuch as albedo, leaf area index and the fraction of photosyntheti-\ncally active radiation\u2014is now available operationally and can be \nused in assimilation mode by Land Surface Schemes (LSS) of \nclimate and/or numerical weather prediction models. It is thus \nmore pertinent than ever to assess the accuracy and consistency \nof the absorbed, reflected and transmitted shortwave radiation \nfluxes in LSS.\n\n\nAt the Pan-GEWEX Meeting in 2006, the GEWEX Global \nLand Atmosphere System Study (GLASS) endorsed the Ra-\ndiation Transfer Model Intercomparison reference solutions for \nthe Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameteriza-\ntion Schemes (RAMI4PILPS) suite of experiments. The goal of \nRAMI4PILPS is to evaluate current radiative transfer formula-\ntions, look-up table approaches, and parametric solutions that \nquantify the shortwave radiation transfer within and beneath \nvegetation canopies in a manner suitable for inclusion in LSS of \nclimate simulation and weather prediction models. \n\n\nAll RAMI4PILPS experiments focus exclusively on (solar) short-\nwave radiation, specifically on its partitioning into reflected (R), \nabsorbed (A) and transmitted (T) flux components in the visible \nand near-infrared spectral regions. RAMI4PILPS experiments \ndo not involve quantities pertaining to longwave radiation, nor \ndo they involve forcing terms or temporal evolutions. Instead, \nthese experiments are \u201cinstantaneous snapshots\u201d of how direct \nor diffuse shortwave radiation (impinging at the top of a vegeta-\ntion canopy) is partitioned into the aforementioned flux com-\nponents, such that the energy balance can be written as: A=1-R \n- (1-?)T, where ? is the soil albedo.\n\n\nWithin the RAMI4PILPS suite of experiments, two different \nsets of test cases are proposed: (1) structurally homogeneous \nenvironments that are reminiscent of grasslands and closed for-\nest canopies, where participants are required to deliver all three \nradiative surface fluxes (R, A, and T) on the basis of detailed \nspectral and structural canopy descriptions; and (2) structurally \n\n\nheterogeneous environments that are reminiscent of shrublands \nand open forest canopies, where participants are provided with \ndetailed canopy descriptions and the surface reflectance, R (often \navailable in real application from remote sensing observations) \nand are requested to deliver their model\u2019s estimate of the parti-\ntioning of the remaining energy into A and T. \n\n\nIn all cases the soil albedo, illumination conditions and foliage \nspectral properties are given, as are detailed structural properties \nof the various canopies. RAMI4PILPS will assess the quality of \nthe submitted radiative fluxes by direct comparison with refer-\nence solutions obtained from Monte Carlo models that were \nevaluated during the various phases of the RAMI benchmarking \nexercise (Pinty et al., 2001, 2004; Widlowski et al., 2007). \n\n\nRAMI4PILPS directly benefits participants of PILPS by: (1) \nquantifying the typical errors associated with different modes of \nestimating the partitioning of shortwave radiative surface fluxes \nin LSS; (2) identifying the impact that structural and spectral \nsub-grid variability may have on these flux estimates; and (3) \nverifying the conservation of energy at the level of the surface.  \nRAMI4PILPS can thus be envisaged as a quality control mecha-\nnism to assess the appropriateness of radiative flux formulations \nin current and future LSS in light of assimilation efforts of remote \nsensing products into climate and weather prediction models.\n\n\nInterested participants are asked to contact the RAMI4 \nPILPS coordinator (rami.webadmin@jrc.it) and submit their \nflux estimates before 15 April 2009 using the procedure out-\nlined on the RAMI4PILPS web site at http://rami-benchmark. \njrc.ec.europa.eu/. For both sets of RAMI4PILPS test cases, the \nsubmission of simulation/look-up table results from stand-\nalone radiation transfer models as well as modules that are part \nof larger simulation models are encouraged, be they Soil Veg-\netation Atmosphere Transfer, numerical weather prediction or \nregional/global circulation models. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nPinty, B., et al., 2001.

The \nPan-GCSS meetings are held every 3 years to promote inter-\naction between its many working groups, discuss advances \non relevant topics in the field of clouds and convection, and \nattract new scientists to its activities.\n\n\nGCSS investigates cloud systems, their role in the climate sys-\ntem, and their representation in models in order to improve \nprediction of weather and climate using state-of the-art mod-\nelling and data assimilation systems. This research is presently \nconducted through four working groups that concentrate on \ndifferent cloud systems: (1) boundary layer clouds, (2) cir-\nrus clouds, (3) precipitating convective cloud systems, and \n(4) polar clouds. The strategy of these groups is to conduct \nprocess-oriented studies based on field experiments using \nhigh-resolution models such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) \nmodels and Cloud Resolving Models (CRMs) as a virtual \nlaboratory. Observational data, LES model and CRM output \nare analyzed and compared among different model codes and \nused to develop and evaluate parameterizations to be used in \nlarge-scale climate and numerical weather prediction (NWP) \nmodels. This parameterization evaluation is performed by \nSingle Column Model (SCM) versions of General Circula-\ntion Models (GCMs) that are challenged to reproduce simi-\nlar cloud and turbulent transport properties as observed and \nsimulated in virtual laboratories. The critical premise of this \nstrategy is that the intermodel differences between the high \nresolution model (i.e., CRM and LES) output is substantially \nsmaller than the intermodel differences of the parameterized \nprocesses in the SCMs. \n\n\nA new and overarching theme of GCSS is related to cloud \nmicrophysics, precipitation, and the influence of these pro-\ncesses on the mean thermodynamic atmospheric state. Three \nexamples of the present research are given below. \n\n\nThe first example deals with warm maritime shallow clouds \nsuch as those observed during the Rain in Cumulus over \nthe Ocean (RICO) experiment, which has quantified con-\nvincingly that precipitation is a common feature for these \nclouds, a feature often neglected in large-scale models. The \ntenth intercomparison case for LES models and SCMs \nof the Working Group of Boundary Layer Clouds showed \nthat precipitation limits the growth of these cumulus clouds \nand hence the depth of the boundary layer, while consecu-\ntive sensitivity studies reveal that moister boundary lay-\ners lead to deeper clouds that rain more. The LES ensem-\nble mean value of the surface rain rate is 21 Wm-2, which \n\n\nAdvances in Modelling and Observing Clouds \nand Convection Highlighted at the \n\n\n4th PAN-GCSS Meeting\n\n\nA. Pier Siebesma, Chair, GCSS Panel\nRoyal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), De Bilt,  \nThe Netherlands; Delft University of Technology, Delft, The \nNetherlands\n\n\nis in close agreement with the SPOL-radar estimates of  \n18 Wm-2. The individual LES model results, however, exhibit \na wide spread ranging from 0 to 25 Wm-2. More worrying \nis the observation that the LES models with sophisticated \nbinned microphysics schemes do not provide more accurate \nprecipitation rates than the ones with simpler two-moment \nbulk microphysical schemes for these warm clouds. SCMs \nshow an equivalent large range of uncertainty in precipita-\ntion. Many of these uncertainties can be attributed to un-\ncertainties in the assumed probability distribution functions \nof the raindrop sizes and the evaporation rates of rain; more \ndetails can be found at http://www.knmi.nl/samenw/rico.\n\n\nThe second example is based on mixed-phase stratocumulus \nclouds such as those observed during the U.S. Department of \nEnergy\u2019s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Pro-\ngram\u2019s Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (MPACE) at  \nthe Alaskan coast near Barrow. The upper half of the well-mixed \nboundary layer contained a mixed-phase cloud with a cloud \ntop temperature of -15\u00b0C. The observed liquid water path was  \n160 g m-2 and the ice water path, computed as the mass of \nice between the surface and cloud top, was 15 g m-2. A model \nintercomparison study of SCMs, CRMs and LES models has \nbeen organized jointly by the GCSS Polar Clouds Working \nGroup and the ARM Program (Klein et al., 2008). This study \nshows that, on average, all three classes of models strongly \nunderestimate the amount of supercooled water by a factor of \nthree (see figure on next page). This underestimation is most \nprominent for models using a single moment microphys-\nics scheme in which the split-up between ice and water is a \nsimple diagnostic function based on temperature only. The \nbias is reduced for more sophisticated two-moment bulk mi-\ncrophysics schemes. However, further reduction through the \nuse of even more sophisticated explicit binned microphysics \ndid not improve on the underestimation tendency, which is \nin line with findings for the warm clouds of RICO. Sensitiv-\nity studies show that the underestimation of the supercooled \nliquid water is predominantly due to the conversion rates of \nliquid water to ice.\n\n\nThe third and last example concerns cirrus ice clouds based \non observations from 9 March 2000 at the Oklahoma ARM \nSouthern Great Plains site; these observations form the basis \nof a model intercomparison study organized by the Cirrus \nWorking Group. The main focus of this study is on evalua-\ntion of these ice clouds for ice water path (IWP), ice number \nconcentration (ICN) and ice particle fall speeds. While there \nis fair agreement between observations and the CRM results \nfor IWP and ICN, all models seem to underestimate the ice \nparticle fall velocity. Moreover, SCMs tend to overestimate \nice amount and underestimate the decay of ice water content \nwith time. The errors point toward problems with the vertical \nvelocity, the influence of subgrid variability, and the specifica-\ntion of ice particle fall velocity in present day parameteriza-\ntions for ice clouds. \n\n\nThese three examples demonstrate that cloud microphysics is \none of the larger uncertainties for all cloud types (warm, ice and \nmixed-phase) and that further dedicated research is needed.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nTo respond to this urgent need, a new cloud microphysics \nworking group was established, chaired by Ulrike Lohmann, \nwith a kick-off meeting held during the Pan-GCSS meeting. \nTwo different approaches are currently being put forward. One \napproach is to conduct idealized simulations for the CRM \n(and where possible for the SCM) community. Ben Shipway \nof the UK Met Office has proposed three idealized cases: (1) \none warm rain maritime cumulus case based on RICO; (2) \na deep convective case from the Kwajalein Experiment; and \n(3) one mixed-phase case from MPACE (Klein et al., 2008). \nIn order to separate uncertainties caused by dynamics from \nuncertainties caused by the microphysical formulation itself, \ndynamics are partially prescribed through simple transient \nupdraughts that advect moisture and hydrometeors, keep-\ning the temperature fixed (including negation of latent heat \nrelease) and allowing only positive increments to the initial  \nvapor field. This way uncertainties due to different formula-\ntions in the microphysics can be more easily quantified. \n\n\nThe second approach uses long-term SCM intercomparisons \nat the atmospheric profiling site Cabauw (The Netherlands) \nusing the CloudNet classification scheme. Participating \nSCMs are nudged with European Centre for Medium-range \nWeather Forecasts reanalyses and the outputs are evaluated \nwith CloudNet data, which provides information about \ncloud phase and the type of precipitation. This approach can \nbe used for the validation of freezing parameterizations and \nprecipitation development in SCM/GCM and NWP. If suc-\ncessful, it can be extended to ARM sites and others. \n\n\nAlthough parameterization evaluations of large-scale models \nusing SCMs based on individual cases\u2014such as is done rou-\ntinely in the four working groups\u2014are a necessary step in pa-\nrameterization development, it is not necessarily sufficient to \nevaluate new parameterization schemes in a broader 3-dimen-\nsional (3-D) context. Therefore, the GEWEX Pacific Cross \nSection Intercomparison (GPCI) Working Group is evaluat-\ning cloud properties of 3-D climate and numerical weather \npredictions along a transection over the Pacific Ocean encom-\npassing regions of persistent stratocumulus, shallow cumuli, \n\n\nScatterplot of median liquid water path and ice water path from ob-\nservations and model simulations based on MPACE. The dashed rect-\nangle indicates the likely range of the regionally averaged liquid and \nice water path. Note that most models (SCMs as well as CRMs) tend \nto strongly underpredict the liquid water path for these arctic mixed-\nphase clouds (taken from Klein et al.).\n\n\nand deep convective tropical clouds, the three prevalent cloud \ntypes over the marine subtropics. For recent developments \nand background, please see the article on the cover page of \nthis newsletter.\n\n\nA new focal point of GCSS deals with cloud climate feed-\nback. The Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project \n(CFMIP) was launched in 2003 to encourage coordinated \nresearch in the area of cloud feedback in climate models.  \nCFMIP has been successful in quantifying the uncertainties \nin cloud climate feedback and has identified low clouds as be-\ning highly influential. The project is now entering its second \nphase, during which a prime question is, Which modelling \nassumptions in the parameterizations of clouds, boundary \nlayer, and convective processes affect their response to climate \nchange? To this purpose, a collaboration between CFMIP \nand GCSS has been initiated and practical working plans \nwere discussed during breakout sessions at the Pan-GCSS \nMeeting. For more details on the future plans of the GCSS/\nCFMIP collaboration, see page 10 in this newsletter. \n\n\nA special theme at the meeting was high-resolution model-\nling on large domains. Ever increasing computer resources \nallow us to resolve spatial scales over more than three orders \nof magnitude on time scales of several days to weeks. Marat \nKharoutdinov, of Stony Brook University, showed the poten-\ntial of LES modelling of tropical deep convection on large \ndomains of 200 km at a resolution of 100 meters based on \nobservations from the Global Atmospheric Research Program \n(GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE). It is encour-\naging to see that realistic mesoscale structures such as precip-\nitation-induced cold pools do show up in such simulations, \nprovided that LES is conducted on large enough domains \n(see figure below). This opens the opportunity to use LES \nmodelling as a virtual laboratory for deep convection in a way \n\n\nTop view of a 100x100 km zoom-in area of an LES of tropical convec-\ntion based on GATE showing cold pools, cumulus congestus, and deep \nconvection (Courtesy Marat Khairoutinov, Stony Brook University).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nthat is similar to its application to smaller scale boundary layer \nclouds during the last decade. \n\n\nAnother interesting development is the use of CRMs as op-\nerational high resolution numerical weather prediction mod-\nels. Axel Seifert (Deutscher Wetterdienst) showed results of \nthe German convective-scale short range model Consortium \nfor Small-scale Modelling, Germany (COSMO-DE) that is \noperationally running with a resolution of 2.8 km. This devel-\nopment addresses new parameterization issues, such as how \nto parameterize cloud-related processes at resolutions of 1\u20135 \nkm. This is a difficult resolution (a \u201cphysics no man\u2019s land\u201d) \nat which convective cloud processes are partially resolved but \nit is not clear whether standard parameterization approaches \nand quasi-equilibrium assumptions are applicable. The inter-\naction between parameterized boundary layer processes and \nthe resolved convection appears to be crucial. \n\n\nA final new development is the use of Global Cloud Resolv-\ning Models, such as the Japanese Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral \nAtmospheric Model that operates at a resolution of 3.5 km, \nalbeit for short periods only (Miura et al., 2007). Despite \nthe fact that dependency of the resolved convection on un-\nresolved processes exists, these model results offer an unprec-\nedented and interesting model database to analyze interac-\ntions between large-scale atmospheric circulation and tropical \nconvection in a global context.\n\n\nFinally, in order to strengthen the interaction between the \nGCSS modelling community and the observational commu-\nnity, there was a special session on: results of recent field cam-\npaigns such as the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analy-\nsis Project (AMMA), the Climate Observation and Prediction \nStrategy, and the Tropical Warm Pool International Cloud \nExperiment (TWP-ICE); cloud climatologies of new satellite \nproducts such as those derived from Cloudsat and the Cloud-\nAerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations; \nand new products from atmospheric profiling stations such as \nARM and CLOUDNET. As a result, new GCSS cases based \non TWP-ICE and AMMA are being designed by the GCSS \nWorking Group on Precipitating Convective Systems, and \nsatellite products from the A-Train satellite constellation will \nbe used for model evaluation on GPCI. \n\n\nIt was encouraging to see such a fruitful collaboration among \nmodel developers, the cloud observational community and \nthe climate model evaluation community. The challenge \nof GCSS for the coming years will be to keep the dialogue \namong these three communities alive.

Intermodel differ-\nences in cloud feedbacks remain the primary source of this \nspread (Randall et al., 2007; Dufresne and Bony, 2008). It \nshould be emphasized, however, that uncertainties in cloud \nprocesses and feedbacks are not the sole problem of climate \nsensitivity estimates. \n\n\nClouds play a critical role in anthropogenic aerosol-induced \nclimate forcing. In addition to modulating the Earth\u2019s radia-\ntion balance, clouds also play a key role in the hydrological \ncycle and in the large-scale atmospheric circulation, at both \nplanetary and regional scales. By affecting precipitation and \natmospheric dynamics, uncertainties in cloud and moist \nprocesses are a concern for virtually all aspects of climate \nmodelling and climate change research. In a context where \nthe climate modelling community is increasingly focusing its \nefforts on the assessment of regional climate change impacts \nand biochemical (e.g., carbon and aerosols) climate feed-\nbacks, improving our understanding of cloud-climate inter-\nactions and the representation of cloud and moist processes \nin climate models remains imperative. It is in fact an urgent \nneed if we are to gain confidence in simulations of future \nclimate changes, both at the global and regional scales.\n\n\nThe difficulty that general circulation models (GCMs) have \nin predicting clouds, which was first emphasized 30 years \nago by A. Arakawa and J. Charney, has been an unresolved \nproblem for the modelling community. Fortunately there \nare now new resources available to observe clouds, such as \nthe A-Train constellation of satellites, the long time-series \nof ground-based observations from instrumented sites, and \nmany observational campaigns. On the modelling side, \ncloud-resolving models (CRMs) and large-eddy simula-\ntion models (LES) now run on increasingly large space \nand time scales, and a new generation of climate models is \nemerging that uses CRM physics in place of conventional \nparameterizations and performs global simulations of the \nEarth\u2019s atmosphere. In such a context, two questions arise: \n(1) Why has progress been so slow in the representation \nand understanding of cloud-climate interactions? and (2) \nHow can we ensure that these new resources will actually \nlead to progress? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nCFMIP Phase 2\nPart of the problem is that bridges have been missing between \ndifferent research communities involved in cloud studies. To \nremedy this problem, Phase 2 of the Cloud Feedback Model \nIntercomparison Project (CFMIP-2), in close collaboration \nwith the GEWEX Cloud System Study (GCSS), is currently \nengaged in the construction of three such bridges.\n\n\nBridge 1: CFMIP Observation Simulator Package (COSP)\nCOSP is a community software tool, which was developed at \nseveral research centers (the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, \nLMD Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, Colorado State Univer-\nsity and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) and \nallows us to diagnose from climate model outputs some quan-\ntities (e.g., brightness temperatures at specific wavelengths,  \nradar reflectivities and lidar scattering ratios) that can \nbe directly and consistently compared to satellite re-\ntrievals, while taking into account issues related to the \nviewing geometry, the cloud vertical overlap, the sen-\nsitivity of instruments and the attenuation of the re-\nmote signals (Klein and Jakob, 1999; Webb et al., 2001; \nChepfer et al., 2008; Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2008). COSP  \nincludes modules capable of simulating the International \nSatellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), CloudSat \nand Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite \nObservations (CALIPSO) data, and will be widely distrib-\nuted to modelling groups (http://www.cfmip.net). \n\n\nBridge 2: Process-Oriented Diagnostics\nThe evaluation of general circulation model simulations\u2014not \nonly at the large-scale level and on long time-scales but also at \nthe process level\u2014will contribute to a better understanding \nof the physical processes involved in the large-scale behavior \nof clouds and their dependence on model parameterizations, \nand help to better assess the credibility of these simulations \n\n\nby comparison with LES/CRM models and in-situ observa-\ntions from instrumented sites or field campaigns.\n\n\nBridge 3: Idealized Simulations\nOne condition to narrow the widening gap between sim-\nulation and understanding in climate modelling (Held, \n2005) is to better understand the reasons why complex \nclimate models behave the way they do and why they \ndiffer from one another. Examining moist processes and \ncloud-climate feedbacks in a suite of simplified or idealized \ncontexts, such as in aqua-planet experiments (Medeiros et \nal., 2008) or through uni-dimensional cloud feedback ex-\nperiments that aim to mimic the behavior of specific cloud \ntypes predicted by GCMs under climate change (Zhang \nand Bretherton, 2008), will help to determine and priori-\ntize the most critical processes. Such guidance is critical \nif we are to design observational and modelling strategies \nto improve our confidence in climate model predictions. \nThese experiments will also help to build a bridge between \nglobal climate modelling, very fine-scale modelling and \nconceptual or theoretical representations of the climate \nsystem. The benefits associated with each approach may \ncomplement each other in a constructive way.\n\n\nRecommendations for Advancing Cloud-Climate  \n  Feedback Assessments\nTo foster the above activities, the CFMIP and GCSS com-\nmunities, with the endorsement of the GEWEX Scientific \nSteering Group and the World Meteorological Organi-\nzation (WMO) Commission for Atmospheric Sciences \n(CAS) Working Group on Numerical Experimentation \n(WGNE), have prepared a set of recommendations for ad-\nvancing the assessment of cloud-climate feedbacks. Those \nrecommendations were discussed at the last meeting of the \nWCRP Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) \n\n\nTo better evaluate and improve the representa-\ntion of cloud and moist processes by climate \nmodels and to better understand cloud-climate \nfeedbacks, CFMIP2 (in close collaboration with \nGCSS) is engaged in three main activities:\n\n\n(1) the development of an observation sim-\nulator package to evaluate models\u2019 clouds \nusing satellite observations; \n\n\n(2) process diagnostics to better evaluate \nand understand the processes responsible \nfor the large-scale behavior of clouds in \ngeneral circulation models; and \n\n\n(3) idealized simulations to better under-\nstand the cloud-climate feedbacks pro-\nduced by climate models. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nheld in Paris, France, in September 2008, which led the \nWGCM to recommend that:\n\n\n(1) COSP be used in a subset of the main numeri-\ncal experiments that will be coordinated by the \nCoupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) \nin support of the next IPCC assessment report; \n\n\n(2) a few idealized experiments be included in the set \nof the next climate model intercomparison project \n(CMIP5) experiments; and \n\n\n(3) additional cloud diagnostics proposed by CFMIP-\nGCSS be extracted from the models participating \nin CMIP5. \n\n\nA broad scientific community interested in cloud stud-\nies, both on the modelling and observation sides, is keen \nto participate in this effort and contribute to advances \nin cloud-climate feedback assessments by the time of the \nFifth Assessment Report of the IPCC. By that time and \nbeyond, these initiatives will also benefit from and sup-\nport GEWEX-WGNE joint efforts on the improvement of \nphysical parameterizations in climate models. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBodas-Salcedo, A., M.

Research in modelling and observing the degree of land-\natmosphere coupling and feedbacks on local and regional scales \nhas been evolving since the start of the well-known GEWEX \nGlobal Land Atmospheric Coupling Experiment (GLACE). \nWATCH addresses hydrological land-atmosphere coupling, \nand LoCo under the GEWEX Global Land Atmosphere Sys-\ntem Study is studying local land-atmosphere coupling to iden-\ntify conditions or areas where land-atmosphere interaction has \na significant impact on the local climate. LoCo also designs \nmodel intercomparison studies. Results from the workshop in-\ncluded a better definition of local coupling and an outline of an \noverview scientific paper on the topic. \n\n\nA good conceptual definition of local land-atmosphere cou-\npling involves the temporal and spatial scale of all land surface-\nrelated processes directly influencing the state of the Planetary \nBoundary Layer (PBL) (see figure on page 13). These processes \ninclude:\n\n\n(1) direct moistening/drying and heating/cooling of the \nPBL, and the feedback exerted by this PBL change on \nthe surface fluxes;\n\n\n(2) impact of the change of the PBL depth or thermodynam-\nic state on the formation/disappearance of PBL clouds \n(shallow cumulus) induced by land surface fluxes;\n\n\n(3) triggering and fuelling of shallow or deep convection; \nand \n\n\n(4) accumulation of hydrological anomalies in the soil wa-\nter or snow reservoir, as well as the subsequent impacts \nof these surface states on the surface energy balance.\n\n\nIt was also recognized that many expressions of land-atmo-\nsphere coupling are not easily tied to the local scale, such as \nprecipitation response to changing soil moisture in GLACE. \nLarge-scale atmospheric circulation\u2014under certain condi-\ntions\u2014is also clearly affected by the state of the land surface. \nThese examples are considered to be beyond the immediate \nscope of the LoCo theme. Each of the processes listed above is \nbriefly discussed below, guided by the presentations and discus-\nsions that emerged during the workshop. \n\n\nDirect Land-PBL Feedback\nWhile evaporation clearly moistens the atmosphere, it does \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\n(partly) rely on the atmospheric demand for water, depending \non the moisture condition: a straightforward feedback loop is \nevident. However, the state of the (well-mixed dry) PBL is not \nonly dependent on the surface fluxes of heat and moisture but \nalso on the overlying free atmosphere. Daytime PBL drying oc-\ncurs due to a mixing-in of dry air, in spite of an upward surface \nmoisture flux. This feedback needs to be considered when trying \nto estimate surface evaporation from simple environmental vari-\nables, like available energy (A) or vapor pressure deficit (D). \n\n\nA number of diagnostics and concepts were discussed at the \nworkshop. Jim Shuttleworth used the definitions of \u201cclimato-\nlogical resistance\u201d (defining the ratio between A and D) and the \n\u201carea average surface resistance\u201d to give a theoretical explanation \nfor differences in trends between open water and actual evapora-\ntion rates, depending on the aridity of the climate. Compared to \nearlier concepts of the Priestly-Tailor coefficient or McNaugh-\nton\u2019s coupling coefficient, the role of PBL feedback in the char-\nacterization of the surface state is clear. \n\n\nLikewise, Joe Santanello expanded on ear-\nlier work by Alan Betts by decomposing \nthe diurnal evolution of the surface tem-\nperature and humidity into a surface driven \nand entrainment driven component. Pilot \nstudies with the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration\u2019s (NASA) Land In-\nformation System (LIS) were carried out to \nidentify the impact of switching between a \nsuite of land surface or PBL models. The \ndiagnostic is also built into the Single Col-\numn Model (SCM) testbed environment \ndeveloped by Roel Neggers, which is used \nmore and more in GEWEX Cloud System \nStudy (GCSS) and GEWEX Atmospheric \nBoundary Layer Study (GABLS) model \nintercomparison studies. \n\n\nCumulus Formation\nMichael Ek cast the relative contribution of land wetness versus \natmospheric entrainment nicely in an expression of the PBL \nrelative humidity tendency. He performed SCM studies for a \nfew special cases where PBL cloud formation appeared to be \nhighly sensitive to both surface evaporation and atmospheric \nstability above the PBL. However, cloud formation (and its im-\npact on surface radiation and conditional stability) is not well \nembedded in the diagnostics above, so more attention should \nbe focused on these feedbacks in future diagnostic studies. \n\n\nTriggering and Fuelling Convection \nAlthough she was not present at the workshop, the work of \nKirsten Findell proved a valuable component of the LoCo \ntheme, particularly those pieces dealing with the creation of area \nmaps and conditions where soil moisture values affect the for-\nmation of convection (Findell and Eltahir, 2003). SCM models \nwere forced with observed atmospheric profiles that were used \nto identify when and where different soil moisture states were \nable to determine whether or not convection was triggered. Al-\nthough in many cases convective triggering is not determined by \nthe local soil moisture state, cases can be found where convec-\ntion is preferably triggered over either moist or dry soils. Craig \n\n\nFerguson expanded on this concept by calculating the Convec-\ntive Triggering Potential (CTP) and the atmospheric dewpoint \ndepression from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder satellite data \nas a first promising step to creating land-atmosphere feedback \nmaps from spaceborne observations. In addition, he explored \nthe correlations between soil moisture and Lifting Condensa-\ntion Level (LCL) using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radi-\nometer - Earth Observing System data. \n\n\nOn a somewhat smaller scale, Chris Taylor studied the formation \nand dynamics of Mesoscale Convection Systems in the Sahel \nregion, depending on the spatially varying surface temperature \npattern induced by earlier rain storms. He argues that convec-\ntive triggering often takes place at the interface between wet and \ndry soil patches, where both a sufficient surface heating and fur-\nther fuelling of the convective system with moisture occur. His \nwork clearly points at the need to consider spatial variability as a \ncontributor to convective activity and land-atmosphere feedback \nwithin the scope of LoCo.\n\n\nAccumulation of Anomalies\nThe (hydrological) land state has a long \nmemory; many observational and mod-\nelling studies have shown the importance \nof hydrological anomalies in the past to \nexplain extreme conditions in the pres-\nent. Local land-atmosphere interaction \nmay turn into long-lasting positive feed-\nback loops when critical thresholds are \nexceeded. Sonia Seneviratne used a plot \nof monthly mean surface evaporation \n/sensible heat versus a soil moisture in-\ndex to demonstrate a clear difference in \nmemory (causing hysteresis in the plot) \nfor a Northern and Southern European \nFluxnet site. This type of analysis can be \nused to evaluate the realism of land-at-\n\n\nmosphere coupling representation in current climate models.\n\n\nOne of the ultimate goals of the LoCo community is to pro-\nduce comprehensive global distributions of where and when \nthe land surface and the atmosphere have a strong mutual feed-\nback, either positive or negative. The importance of this work \nis demonstrated by Stefan Hagemann, who reviews the various \npathways of land-atmosphere coupling and their representa-\ntion in global climate models (GCMs) used for present-day \nand future climate calculations. Bernie Bisselink\u2019s precipitation \nrecycling analysis made clear that on relatively short mutual \ndistances within Europe, strong recycling is favored under very \ndifferent climatological conditions. Since multiple diagnostics \nand processes are involved, multiple maps already exist. Randy \nKoster provided observational support of the earlier defined \nhotspots of land atmosphere coupling by pinpointing areas \nwhere the correlation between temperature and precipitation \nidentifies regions where evaporation is both highly variable (by \na variation in the degree to which it is controlled by radiation \nor soil water content) and highly coherent (expressing a strong \nsurface control on the evaporation). Such hotspot regions are \nhighly dynamic and are expected to be geographically shift-\ned with climate change, as highlighted by Sonia Seneviratne.  \nRichard de Jeu used satellite imagery of surface soil moisture to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nplot the global distribution of typical time scales of changes in \nsoil moisture, another way to express the potential soil control \non evaporation variability. Together with the remote sensing \nbased maps of Craig Ferguson, a suite of coupling products will \nbecome available that highlights different aspects of the cou-\npling: the PBL feedback (Betts\u2019 soil moisture LCL diagram), \nconvective triggering, soil memory (satellite soil moisture), and \npathways possibly including large-scale processes (Koster\u2019s cou-\npling coefficient).\n\n\nA global map with coupling strength diagnostics needs to in-\ncorporate these various coupling mechanisms. As a start, we \npropose to apply a hierarchy approach where the coupling \npathway may be associated with an index, which is subsequent-\nly plotted. The first level of coupling is the direct PBL feed- \nback, which may be expressed as the degree to which evapo-\nration is sensitive to soil moisture. A positive feedback may \nemerge when low evaporation/high sensible heat flux may en-\nhance PBL growth that leads to further drying and a higher \nBowen ratio. A second level would cover the formation of PBL \nclouds and its radiative consequences. A positive feedback here \nmight be a case where clouds develop at high moisture con-\ntents, reducing surface radiation, surface heating, and PBL \ngrowth and allowing for a further build-up of PBL humidity. \nThe third level is the triggering of convection, which may show \npositive or negative feedback via the likelihood of generating \nprecipitation that moistens the soil, as detailed by Findell and \nTaylor. Finally, level four expresses an overall hydrological feed-\nback signature that is produced by the impact of land surface \non precipitation, i.e., diagnosed from the coupling coefficient \ndetailed by Koster.\n\n\nWhat would such a map look like? Starting from the first level \ncoupling, areas will be highlighted where changes in soil mois-\nture do have a pronounced effect on the daytime PBL. For in-\nstance, the ratio between the surface and entrainment Bowen \nratio diagnosed from Santanello\u2019s framework changes signifi-\ncantly for small soil moisture perturbations. Where this is not \nthe case, a strong impact of land surface on the atmospheric \nstate cannot be expected, and further analysis is not necessary. \nFor areas where index 1 is significant, the second and third feed-\nback via cloud formation or convective triggering can be tested. \nLikewise, a small soil moisture perturbation leads to cloud for-\nmation which is either shallow without rain (index 2) or deeper \nwith possible rainfall (index 3). The formation of rainfall will \nat the end be labeled as index 4. If somewhere in the chain this \nfeedback appears weak or even negative, a strong impact of (lo-\ncal) land state on (local) precipitation is not expected.\n\n\nThis framework is still maturing; a proof of concept will be ex-\namined using the NASA LIS coupled to the Weather Research \nFoundation atmospheric model featuring a suite of land, PBL \nand convection parameterization schemes. For a number of \ndifferent climate regimes, a set of snapshot experiments will be \nset up and perturbation experiments applied to determine the \nhierarchy of coupling indices. If this setup is successful, we will  \nextend it to the multi-year global scale. For more information, \nvisit http://www.knmi.nl/~hurkvd/LoCo_workshop_2008.html. \nReferences\nFindell, K.

Sev-\neral upper air and surface stations have been renovated, and \nworkshops focused on surface and upper air measurements \nhave led to improved quality of observations. Four technical \nsupport projects have been established in developing areas \nto provide direct technical support to GCOS stations. Nine \nCommission for Basic Systems Lead Centers for GCOS \nhave been established around the world to provide better \ncoordination with operating stations. \n\n\nThe BSRN Project Manager noted that activities beyond ba-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nsic data collection have been constrained during the past 2 \nyears as a result of BSRN management focusing on the data \narchive transition, and also due to widespread tightening of \nbudgets. Considerable work on other topics related to sur-\nface radiation and associated interests continues both within \nand outside BSRN. While there has long been an empha-\nsis on the open publication of results obtained within the \nBSRN project, this meeting saw a renewed request that all \nsubstantial undertakings related to the organization\u2014and \nparticularly its working groups\u2014should lead to and result \nin such publication or results needed to ensure that the work \nreceives appropriate credit and will be readily available for \nfuture generations who will pursue this work. \n\n\nIt was noted that BSRN should consider providing a broad-\ner range of data products through its archive in order to \nbe more responsive to its user community, and to extend \nthe utility of the information acquired as part of the effort. \nFuture guidance will be provided to the BSRN archive as to \nwhich products might be most useful. \n\n\nResults were summarized from the International Workshop \non Global Dimming and Brightening (GDB), held 10\u201314 \nFebruary 2008 in Ein Gedi, Israel. In particular, BSRN is \nwell positioned to address GDB issues, and was recognized \nas a world leader in surface radiation measurement activities. \nThere was general agreement at the conference that longer, \nbetter spatially distributed surface radiation measurement \nrecords are needed, especially over the oceans. In addition, \nagreement was reached that the GDB phenomenon is real \nand that the next step is to determine the causes.\n\n\nThe Surface Radiation Budget Project has produced a con-\ntinuous record of shortwave/longwave radiation data (SRB \nV3.0) for the top of the atmosphere as well as the Earth's \nsurface at a 1\u00b0 longitude by 1\u00b0 latitude resolution for the \ntime span of 23 years, from July 1983 to June 2006. The data \nare given at 3-hourly, 3-hourly-monthly, daily, and monthly \nmeans. Since these data are derived from satellite-based ob-\nservations, it is important to validate the data set against \nground-based measurements such as those of BSRN. \n\n\nThe culmination of several years\u2019 work as reported in three \ndefining publications has resulted in a proposed reference \ngroup of pyranometers for diffuse solar irradiance. This \nwork has established the certain accuracy uncertainty in dif-\nfuse solar irradiance observations, considering all the ma-\njor known sources of uncertainty are found to be within  \n2\u20134 W/m2. The work provides a reference through which \ncurrent and future diffuse solar irradiance observations can \nbe evaluated, although the work provides more for a meth-\nodology and set of evaluation criteria by which other in-\ndependent approaches can be evaluated and related to the \nsame level agreement.\n\n\nLarge uncertainties were still reported to exist in our knowl-\nedge of the Earth radiation balance and its representation \nin climate models. Accordingly, global mean radiation bud-\ngets simulated by climate models differ largely, particularly \n\n\nat the surface. BSRN data provide a unique opportunity to \nconstrain these uncertainties. The data suggest that many \nmodels overestimate downward solar radiation and underes-\ntimate downward longwave radiation. \n\n\nBSRN data also allowed the detection of widespread sur-\nface solar brightening since the early 1990s, after decades of \ndimming. Global climate model simulations performed at \nthe Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) with the \nECHAM5-HAM model suggest that brightening will turn \nback into a dimming in the coming decades, and downward \nlongwave radiation will increase at 2\u20133 Wm-2 per decade. It \nwill therefore be exciting to see what BSRN data will show \nover coming years, and whether they will support or dis-\nprove the model predictions.\n\n\nMany additional focused papers were presented on the work \nof BSRN site scientists and other topics related to surface ra-\ndiation observation and quantification. The meeting provides \nan excellent forum for these papers, where many of those in \nattendance share similar interests and often conduct related \ninvestigations. All presentations were directly related to some \naspect of quantitative surface radiation determination, as \nwell as the use and evaluation of that information. While \nthere were too many presentations to review here, the com-\nplete agenda and most presentation materials are available on \nthe BSRN website at http://www.gewex.org/bsrn.html. \n\n\nAs of early 2008, BSRN has 3,941 site-months of data in the \narchive from 39 ground sites located on all continents; the \nearliest data go all the way back to 1992. The measurements \nare made at 1-minute, 2-minute, 3-minute or 5-minute in-\ntervals. Considerable work is needed to process the BSRN \ndata to make them comparable with the GEWEX SRB data. \nAdditionally, the BSRN data files contain 11 quality flags \nfor each data point. A procedure needs to be designed to ap-\npropriately use the information in order to exclude possibly \nerroneous data.\n\n\nThe exceptional hospitality of the KNMI staff, particularly  \nDr. Wouter Knap, in hosting the meeting and arranging for \nthe site tour of the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmo-\nspheric Research was greatly appreciated.\n\n\nA new peer-reviewed international journal reporting on all \naspects of Earth System Modelling is open for submis-\nsions. JAMES has sections for research articles, short top-\nics, review articles, and a special section for articles on \npolicy and science education related to climate science. \nJAMES is an open-access journal, so anyone with internet \naccess can read and download articles at no cost. \n\n\nSee the JAMES web site for more details at http://adv-\nmodel-earth-syst.org/.\n\n\nNew Publication: Journal of Advances \nin Modelling Earth Systems (JAMES) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\n25th ISCCP Anniversary Symposium\n\n\n23\u201325 July 2008 \nNew York, NY, USA\n\n\nWilliam B. Rossow\nNOAA/CREST, City College of New York, NY, USA\n\n\nIn July 2008, the International Satellite Cloud Climatology \nProject (ISCCP), the first project of the World Climate Re-\nsearch Programme, marked the 25th Anniversary of the begin-\nning of data collection. Not bad for a project that originally \nwas to last for only 5 years! The original concept for ISCCP \nwas to collect and distribute enough global satellite data to \nfacilitate research on the role of clouds in climate, specifical-\nly their effects on the radiation budget and their role in the \natmospheric water cycle. These data were to be sampled at \nsufficiently fine space-time intervals to capture the mesoscale-\nto-global scale and diurnal-to-interannual variations of cloud \nphysical properties.\n\n\nIn addition to calibrating, navigating, quality checking and \ndistributing the satellite radiance data for the research com-\nmunity to use (one of the earliest projects to invest in more \n\u201cuser-friendly\u201d Level 1 data), ISCCP conducted a comparison \nof the then-existing cloud algorithms and then processed the \nradiance data to provide several different cloud data products \nfor research. After more research and evaluation results accu-\nmulated, the ISCCP analysis was revised, particularly to in-\nclude a treatment for ice clouds. The ISCCP product line has \ncontinued to expand, now including radiative flux profiles, \ncloud particle sizes and several subsets concerning specific \ncloud system types (i.e., convective tracking, cyclone tracking, \npattern recognition analysis for tropics and midlatitudes).\n\n\nTo celebrate this occasion, as well as to take stock of research \nprogress and discuss plans for the future, a Symposium was \nheld at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n(NASA) Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the \nGlobal Processing Center for ISCCP. About 40 scientists from \nsix countries participated. The presentations are posted on the \nISCCP website at: http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/index.html.\n\n\nInvited speakers began each topic session: J. Hansen (NASA \nGISS, Clouds in Climate); R. Schiffer [University of Mary-\n\n\nParticipants at the ISCCP Anniversary Symposium\n\n\nland, Baltimore County, International Satellite Cloud Cli-\nmatology Project (ISCCP) Evolution from Lake Balaton to \nGEWEX]; J.J. Bates [National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center, \nProducing Climate Data Records]; C. Stubenrauch [Labo-\nratoire de M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie Dynamique, Cloud Properties from \nRemote Sensing]; A.D. Del Genio (NASA GISS, Cloud Be-\nhavior from Remote Sensing); E. Raschke (Hamburg Univer-\nsity, Cloud Effects on the Radiation Budget); C. Kummerow \n[Colorado State Unicersity (CSU), Clouds in the Hydrologi-\ncal Cycle]; and G. Stephens (CSU, New Frontiers in Cloud \nRemote Sensing).\n\n\nThree discussion sessions took place at the meeting, concern-\ning: (1) making ISCCP \u201coperational,\u201d (2) the way forward to \nunderstanding cloud-climate feedbacks and (3) future cloud \nresearch. One idea that was discussed for the operational ver-\nsion of ISCCP involved a more intimate merger of the imaging \nand sounding instruments on the polar orbiting satellites that \nform the anchor for the data set: several possible approaches \nwere suggested. Another concern was about \u201coperational\u201d cli-\nmate data set production, particuarly the need for continual \nevaluation (and correction if needed) by the research com-\nmunity. No clear way forward on cloud-climate feedback was \nidentified, so it is clear that new analysis approaches need to \nbe developed that can reduce the complexity of the problem \nwithout sacrificing the validity of the results. Some early steps \nalong these lines were presented at the Symposium and many \ninformal discussions took place during breaks about new \napproaches and collaborations. The discussion of the newer \ncloud measurements indicates that the next several years of \nresearch should produce important results; there were also \ndiscussions about how to combine results from many differ-\nent kinds of instruments most effectively. In particular, the \ntime resolution of the geostationary imaging measurements \nhas to be combined with the more extensive spectral informa-\ntion and vertical profiling from polar orbiting instruments to \nconstruct a complete view of the dynamics of cloud systems.\n\n\nThe ISCCP products have now developed into one of the lon-\ngest time records of global cloud variations and have become \npart of the Global Climate Observing System. Approval of \ncontinuing funding now makes it possible to switch the anal-\nysis from the 30-km sampled radiances to the 10-km sampled \n\n\nradiances, which will provide results at nearly \nthe full (infrared) resolution and make the \nproducts statistically more robust for cloud \nprocess studies. While ISCCP was not origi-\nnally designed as a \u201cclimate data record,\u201d with \nthe record length growing there is more inter-\nest in that use. There are a number of features \nthat make the current products less useful for \nthat purpose, but approval has been obtained \nto re-engineer the ISCCP processing system \nto improve the quality enough to form a \ncloud Climate Data Record and to make the \nwhole project \u201coperational\u201d to continue into \nthe future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nGEWEX Executive and\nJoint CLIVAR-GEWEX Executive Meetings\n\n\n25\u201326 August 2008\nSilver Spring, Maryland USA\n\n\nPeter van Oevelen\nDirector, International GEWEX Project Office, Silver Spring, MD, \nUSA\n\n\nThe GEWEX Executive Meeting was hosted by the Inter-\nnational GEWEX Project Office (IGPO). IGPO staff met \nwith the three GEWEX Panel Chairs and the Chair of the \nScientific Steering Group (SSG) to review GEWEX ac-\ntivities and planning based on guidance given by the SSG \nand the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) \nJoint Scientific Council. Following the GEWEX Execu-\ntive Meeting, IGPO hosted a 2-day joint meeting with the \nClimate Variability and Predictability Project (CLIVAR) \nExecutive members to discuss current and future collabo-\nration between the two programs and their roles within \nWCRP for the next 2 to 5 years. \n\n\nDuring the GEWEX Executive Meeting, the GEWEX \nPanels presented their progress and future plans, empha-\nsizing cross-panel cooperation. While we are clearly on the \nright track as we tighten links between the panels, much \ncan still be done. Discussions included how to strengthen \nthe ways in which modelling development completed by \nthe GEWEX Modelling and Prediction Panel relates to \nmodelling activities completed by other GEWEX proj-\nects and working groups, particularly in acquiring clar-\nity on matters such as model parameterization and model \nimprovement activities versus model diagnostics. One of \nthe challenges for the GEWEX Radiation Panel (GRP) is \nhow to create data sets from the latest observing systems \nthat enhance rather than replace long time series such as \nthe International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project. To  \naddress this issue GRP is looking at \u201cfamilies\u201d of products \n\n\nParticipants at the GEWEX Executive and Joint CLIVAR-GEWEX Executive Meetings\n\n\nthat each serve distinct needs but share underlying proper-\nties. Under the Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Ob-\nservations Project (CEOP), the GEWEX Panel for hydro- \nclimate studies, work on a Multi-Model Analysis for CEOP \nto produce an ensemble mean and variance data set to sup-\nport CEOP science activities was presented. Both CEOP \nco-chairs also showed how CEOP has been progressing \nsince the its merger with the GEWEX Hydrometeorology \nPanel in 2007. \n\n\nAt the joint GEWEX/CLIVAR Executive Meeting, two \nprimary issues were addressed. The first, how to implement \nWCRP crosscuts\u2014in particular, Monsoons and Extremes. \nFor the crosscuts it was agreed that a new panel or steering \ngroup would be counterproductive and difficult to man-\nage for both projects. Instead, the idea to have short-term \n(1\u20133 year) thrusts focusing on tangible tasks that address a \nspecific aspect of monsoons or extremes was deemed very \nuseful and feasible. These so-called foci would be led by a \nsmall team of dedicated scientists involved in the actual \nwork. The joint executive proposed to bring this idea for-\nward during the Pan-WCRP Monsoon meeting held in \nBeijing, China, on 20\u201325 October 2008. For the extremes \ncrosscut, Ronald Stewart and David Legler took up the \nchallenge to work this out with respect to droughts.\n\n\nThe second issue focused on a strategy for the production \nof a \u201clegacy document\u201d in which each program addresses \nits vision with respect to the future of WCRP as a whole. \nGEWEX will take a two-tier approach in which its panels \nand working groups will be asked to contribute to a docu-\nment much like the GEWEX Phase I Accomplishment \nBrochure (http://gewex.org/GEWEXAccompBroc.pdf) that \ncontains short descriptions of the areas where significant \nadvancements have been made and the challenges that have \nbeen addressed. The second step will look forward, both in \nthe relative short to medium timeframe of 2\u20135 years and \nthe longer term (beyond 2013). An overview will be as-\nsembled based upon the input from the GEWEX commu-\n\n\nnity in which the research areas \nand activities that need to be \ninstigated, continued or phased \nout will be presented, along \nwith a rationale. The challenges \nthat remain or that have not yet \nbeen addressed will be present-\ned as well. The collection of the \nlegacy documents from all the \nWCRP-involved projects will \nserve as the basis for discussions \nrelated to future WCRP plans.\n\n\nThe GEWEX and CLIVAR Ex-\necutive members reiterated their \nintention to continue working \ntogether to serve the internation- \nal research community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\n2nd CEOP Annual Meeting \n\n\n15\u201317 September 2008 \nGeneva, Switzerland \n\n\nSam Benedict\nInternational GEWEX Project Office, Silver Spring, MD, USA\n\n\nThe meeting, hosted by the World Climate Research Pro-\ngramme (WCRP), focused on the finalization of the Scien-\ntific Implementation Plan (SIP) for the GEWEX Coordinat-\ned Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project (CEOP). \nThe SIP and copies of all of the meeting presentation mate-\nrials\u2014including abstracts of talks and posters\u2014are available \nat the CEOP home page: http://www.ceop.net.\n\n\nIn his opening talk, Dr. Ghassem Asrar, the Director of \nWCRP, noted that since CEOP assumed responsibility for \nall GEWEX hydroclimate activities in 2007, the Project has \naccepted a new role in undertaking unique scientific stud-\nies and promoting research on the use of model prediction \nensembles and associated statistics by comparing them with \nobservations, and making these results available to other re-\nsearchers for further analysis. CEOP has also devoted consid-\nerable efforts and resources to assemble and make available \nsustained regional reference observations of key meteoro-\nlogical and radiation parameters, together with analysis tools \nand methods, standards for archiving, distributing, analysis \nand visualization of these observations for scientists around \nthe world. In this context CEOP is encouraged to continue \nits focus on contributions to GEWEX that support WCRP \nmission objectives as established in the WCRP Strategic \nFramework 2005\u20132015: to \u201csupport climate-related decision \nmaking and planning adaptation to climate change by devel-\noping science required to improve climate predictions, the \nunderstanding of human influence on climate, and use this \nscientific knowledge in an increasing range of practical appli-\ncations of direct relevance, benefit and value to society.\u201d \n\n\nIn his presentation, the Chairman of the GEWEX Scien-\ntific Steering Group called on CEOP to contribute signifi-\ncantly more to major efforts that are underway to reduce \nuncertainties associated with the climatically sensitive and \nkey hydrological processes in regions where CEOP is ac-\ntive, and ensure their proper representation in the climate \nsystem models.\n\n\nAlso addressed at the meeting was the Global Earth Obser-\nvation System of Systems (GEOSS) 10-Year Implementa-\ntion Plan Reference Document, which states that CEOP \nshould be considered as a prototype of GEOSS. Recogniz-\ning this as an ultimate achievement of CEOP, part of the \nmeeting was organized around this theme with the intent \nof showing the unique nature of the collaboration between \nCEOP, the international group of numerical weather pre-\ndiction centers, and the broader climate research commu-\nnity represented by the World Meteorological Organiza-\ntion, WCRP and GEWEX as they all move toward the \nimplementation of GEOSS. \n\n\nIn this context, the Senior Scientific Expert for the Group \non Earth Observations (GEO) water activities recommend-\ned that CEOP pay close attention to actions related to its \ncontributions to Water Task WA-06-02 (Droughts, Floods \nand Water Resource Management) and Water Task WA-08-\n01 (Integrated Products for Water Resource Management \nand Research) in the near term (2009\u20132011). CEOP will \nmeet its commitments to GEO by maintaining its contin-\nued efforts to improve models and enhance the quality and \nintegration of important hydroclimate data sets. Addition-\nally, CEOP will make an immediate contribution to the \nGEO Portal, a web-based interface for searching and ac-\ncessing the data, information, imagery, services and appli-\ncations at http://www.earthobservations.org. \n\n\nThe presentations and breakout periods organized at the \nmeeting emphasized the expansion of the scope of CEOP \nscience activities. In addition to the Regional Hydrocli-\nmate Projects (RHPs), CEOP includes groups focused on \nstudies in high elevations, monsoon, extremes, cold regions \nand semi-arid regions. A special session associated with the \nCEOP Monsoons Study showed how it is synergistic with \nthe overall WCRP Monsoon Crosscut Initiative. A special \nsession on the CEOP High Elevation Study identified the \npossibility of organizing a global high elevation watch pe-\nriod. The review of CEOP Extremes studies showed that \nCEOP will continue to focus on drought, heavy precipita-\ntion, floods and low flows, including (in some instances) \nthe intermeshing of these extremes. At the same time the \nlinks between the CEOP Cold Regions Study and several \nRHPs were clearly identified. This work will also be coor-\ndinated with the WCRP Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) \nProject. A review of semi-arid regions studies showed prog-\nress on meeting the goals established for this element of \nCEOP.\n\n\nParticipants at the 2nd Annual CEOP Meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19November  2008\n\n\nGlobal Energy and Water Cycle Experiment\n\n\nGEWEX NEWS\nPublished by the International GEWEX Project Office \n\n\nPeter J. van Oevelen, Director\nDawn P.

The \nother CEOP science efforts reviewed at the meeting in-\ncluded a study of the influence of aerosols and the study \nof water isotopes. A review of CEOP modelling efforts was \nalso undertaken at the meeting including explicit global, \nregional, land surface, and Hydrologic Applications Project \n(HAP) reports. All of these modelling groups are looking \nat an ensemble of international models in many different \nregions focused on the CEOP reference sites that were de-\nscribed at the meeting, along with the CEOP satellite data \nset during a review of the CEOP Data Management com-\nponent. With respect to the data issues facing CEOP, it was \nconcluded that a systematic effort was needed to match this \nexpanded CEOP science framework with new and better \nspecialized data sets and data integration tools.  This led to \na number of points of discussion associated with the need \nfor:\n\n\n(1) Better data sets and data integration tools with \nincreased focus on defining and generating new \nmulti-sensor, multi-scale integrated data sets.\n\n\n(2) CEOP to aggressively pursue the fulfillment of \ncommitments made by international participants \nin CEOP to provide, validate, archive and stage \nthe complete baseline data set prescribed in the \ninitial CEOP requirements. \n\n\n(3) CEOP to maintain its relationship with data ar-\nchive centers at the University Corporation for \nAtmospheric Research, the Max-Planck Institute, \nthe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the \nUniversity of Tokyo. \n\n\n(4) CEOP Co-Chairs to ensure that space agencies\u2014\nthrough the Committee on Earth Observation \nSatellites and other important funding groups\u2014\nare encouraged to actively support the CEOP im-\nplementation process. \n\n\n(5) CEOP to coordinate Regional Hydroclimate Proj-\nects efforts in the provision and integration of the \nnew data types necessary to achieve CEOP science \nobjectives. \n\n\n(6) Cooperation with other groups within WCRP \nand GEWEX that are producing specialized data \nsets necessary to meet the CEOP data set require-\nments.\n\n\nThe 3rd Annual CEOP Meeting is scheduled to be held 19\u2013\n21 August 2009 in Melbourne, Australia, prior to the paral-\nlel GEWEX and Integrated Land Ecosystem-Atmospheric \nProcesses Study Science Conferences with joint sessions be-\ning held the following week. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24-28 August 2009 \u2014 Melbourne, Australia\n\n\nWater in a Changing Climate  \nProgress in Land-Atmosphere Interactions and Energy/Water Cycle Research \n\n\nParallel Science Conferences with Joint Sessions\n\n\nThe Sixth International Scientific Conference on the Global Energy and Water Cycle and the Second Integrated Land \nEcosystem-Atmosphere Processes Study (iLEAPS) Science Conference are holding joint sessions to present and discuss \nthe latest scientific developments in the areas of water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles through keynote talks and oral and \nposter presentations. \n\n\nThe venue will provide an opportunity for cross-fertilization efforts between the sciences represented by GEWEX, as part of \nthe World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and iLEAPS, as part of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme \n(IGBP), in addressing present and future climate and global change challenges. \n\n\nPapers are invited for all sessions of the GEWEX and iLEAPS conferences as well as for the following joint session themes:  \n(1) Land in the Climate System; (2) Aerosol, Cloud, Precipitation and Climate Interactions; and (3) Future Generation of Inte-\ngrated Observation and Modelling Systems. \n\n\nFor a full description of the conferences, joint sessions, program updates, and to submit an abstract, see: \n\n\nhttp://www.gewex.org/2009gewex_ileaps_conf.html\n\n\nWednesday, 26 August 26 2009 \nGEWEX/iLEAPS Joint Sessions* \n\n\nSession A:  Land in the Climate System \n                   (R.

From psychology, and other social sciences, to biology, medicine, data mining, \n\n\nstatistics, information retrieval, pattern recognition, climate, remote sensing, machine learning, \n\n\nand marketing, clustering techniques have been successfully applied to practical problems, \n\n\neither for understanding (e.g., identify different variants of psychological depression), or utility \n\n\n(e.g., data compression). More precisely, cluster analysis divides data into groups (clusters), \n\n\nbased on the abstract assumption that there is an underlying grouping in the data structure, \n\n\neither as separate sets of individuals, or a hierarchy of groups. This is done based exclusively \n\n\non information intrinsic to the data, and is for this reason usually called unsupervised \n\n\nclassification or unsupervised learning. \n\n\nDepending on the specific problem, the most suitable clustering technique will necessarily be \n\n\nsome flavor of a number of main approaches, such as prototype-based clustering (e.g., K-\n\n\nmeans Clustering), hierarchical clustering (e.g., Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering), or \n\n\ndensity-based clustering (e.g., DBSCAN [Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications \n\n\nwith Noise]). For many climate-related problems, the nature of the phenomenology, and or the \n\n\napproach taken to tackle it (e.g., weather patterns, climate regimes, cloud characteristics) make \n\n\nprototype-based, and particularly K-means clustering, a reasonable choice (e.g., Jakob and \n\n\nTselioudis 2003; Rossow et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2007). As a prototype-based technique, the \n\n\nK-means (iterative) algorithm generates a single partitioning of the data into a number of (K) \n\n\nclusters and associated centroids (ideal prototypes representing the center of each set of data \n\n\nobjects [cluster], such that each object is more similar [following the evaluation of a proximity \n\n\nmeasure] to its prototype than to the prototype of any of the other sets). However, the fact that \n\n\nK is a user-specified parameter, and because the prototypes (initial or final) do not necessarily \n\n\ncorrespond to actual data objects (note also that random initialization [of centroids] is often \n\n\nused with this technique), gives K-means a certain degree of subjectivity, even if additional \n\n\ntests are performed (e.g., multiple runs of the technique, each starting with different sets of \n\n\ninitial centroids). \n\n\n- 1 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to overcome some of the issues of the traditional K-means clustering technique \n\n\n(specially in what concerns the random initialization of centroids, and the subjective \n\n\nspecification of the number K), a new clustering technique is proposed here that, among other \n\n\nthings: selects for the set of initial centroids, objects taken directly from the dataset being \n\n\nanalyzed; presents a bound for the maximum number of test runs possible (based solely on the \n\n\nnumber of objects in the dataset); and, has the value for K as an objective outcome of the \n\n\nclustering analysis. These aspects of the new technique make it (purely) empirical in nature, \n\n\nmost notably in the selection of the initial prototypes, themselves consistent with states of the \n\n\nsystem (represented by the dataset), and thus, physically meaningful in the specific context of \n\n\nits constrains (e.g., large-scale dynamics, environmental and thermodynamic conditions), and \n\n\nspatiotemporal domain. \n\n\nGEPAT (Grade-based Empirical Pattern Analysis Technique) will be introduced below, and \n\n\napplied to JJA 3-hourly TCC data for the investigation of potential clustering behaviour, \n\n\ncorresponding to preferred patterns of the distribution of cloud cover along the GPCI cross \n\n\nsection, and thus, of the cloud regime transitions that characterize the region. \n\n\nAfter a quick overview of some basic concepts crucial to understand the mechanics of cluster \n\n\nanalysis, the section is essentially divided in two main parts, a first one dedicated to the basic \n\n\nGEPAT algorithm, with the steps involved in the employment of a (grade-based) proximity \n\n\nmeasure in the stages of selection, and assignment of dataset objects to a reference object; and \n\n\na second part dedicated to the optimization process, through which a number of statistics are \n\n\nobtained from prospective clusterings, for inspection and validation of the relative merits of \n\n\ntheir data partitionings. Following a few additional remarks, the section ends with a couple of \n\n\nideas on possible avenues for future development of the GEPAT approach. \n\n\nIntroductory material on cluster analysis can be found, e.g., in Jain and Dubes (1988), \n\n\nAlgorithms for Clustering Data, and in Tan et al. (2005), Introduction to Data Mining. An \n\n\noften referenced publication is also Anderberg (1973), Cluster Analysis for Applications. \n\n\n2 Basic concepts \n\n\nPattern Space    The data objects mentioned above correspond, in this study, to 3-hourly \n\n\nrecords of TCC distributed along the 13 points of the GPCI cross section. Each one of these \n\n\nrecords (or data units) represents a (spatial) TCC pattern and can be seen as a single point in a \n\n\n- 2 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13-dimensional pattern space. Each point in this space can be denoted by a vector, whose (13) \n\n\ncomponents (or attributes) are the scalars corresponding to the TCC values at each location in \n\n\nthe GPCI transect. \n\n\nNormalization    To prepare the data for the cluster analysis, it is required that all 13 attributes \n\n\nof each data unit be available. Additionally, it is usually recommendable to perform some sort \n\n\nof normalization (e.g., for zero mean and unit variance), adjusted to the chosen proximity \n\n\nmeasure. Given the fact that all 13 attributes of each TCC pattern correspond to the same data \n\n\ntype and scale, no a priori normalization has been applied to the data, also because the \n\n\nproximity measure adopted has a scaling factor based on the standard deviation (the details are \n\n\ngiven below). Care should be taken, though, to understand the impact this kind of data \n\n\nmanipulation has, in potentially changing the separation between natural clusters. \n\n\nTypes of Clusterings    The term clustering refers to the collection of all clusters (natural or \n\n\nproposed by cluster analysis) present in a dataset. A clustering can be classified in a number of \n\n\nways, that basically translate the relations between individual clusters. For instance, \n\n\nhierarchical clustering is used for nested clusters, while non-overlapping clusters characterize \n\n\na partitional clustering. If each data unit is assigned to a single cluster, the clustering is \n\n\nclassified as exclusive, on the other hand, if an object belongs to more than one cluster, the \n\n\nclustering is called non-exclusive, or overlapping. A clustering will be complete if every object \n\n\nis assigned to a cluster, and partial otherwise. \n\n\nTypes of Clusters    Clusters that are far from each other, such that the intra-cluster distance \n\n\nbetween any two objects of the same cluster is smaller than the minimum distance between any \n\n\nof the clusters, are said to be well-separated clusters. Density-based clustering abstracts \n\n\nclusters as being regions of higher object density than its surroundings. For prototype-based \n\n\nclusters, a reference point is determined, usually as a centroid (e.g., the average of all the \n\n\npoints in the cluster), to which all the points in the cluster are similar to a higher degree than to \n\n\nthe prototypes of any of the other clusters. \n\n\nProximity Measures    In prototype-based cluster analysis, the assignment of an object to a \n\n\ncentroid is done based on the evaluation of a proximity measure, designed specifically for the \n\n\ndata, and goal, of the cluster analysis. Objects are typically assigned to the \u201cclosest\u201d centroid. \n\n\nA proximity measure can be either a dissimilarity, e.g., Euclidian distance in a pattern space; or \n\n\na similarity, e.g., the grade-based index employed in GEPAT, formally defined as follows: \n\n\n \n\n\n- 3 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n?\n=\n\n\n?\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n? ?\n?=\n\n\nn\n\n\nd d\n\n\njdid\n\n\nN\n\n\nvv\n\n\nn 1\nij 1,0max\n\n\n1\ng\n\n\n?\n(A.1) \n\n\n \n\n\nwhere i and j represent two patterns (j being a centroid, for instance), d represents a particular \n\n\ndimension in the pattern space (or, in this study, a specific location along the GPCI cross \n\n\nsection), n is the total number of dimensions of the pattern space (n = 13, the total number of \n\n\npoints along the cross section), vid and vjd are the dth components of the vectors representing \n\n\npatterns i and j, respectively, ?d is the standard deviation calculated from the variation of the \n\n\nvalues of the dth component of all the patterns in the dataset, and N represents the number of \n\n\nstandard deviations to be applied. \n\n\nAs mentioned above, there is a scaling factor involved in the application of Eq. (A.1). It affects \n\n\nthe 13 vector components of each pattern in the dataset differently, depending on the \n\n\ncorresponding standard deviation (N?d, more precisely). Given the possible range of values of \n\n\nthe TCC parameter (0 % to 100 %), and assuming typical N?d > 1 %, this essentially implies, \n\n\nfor gij, a context in which the population of patterns (and concomitantly of any natural clusters) \n\n\nis, in relation to the original data, nonuniformly contracted toward the origin of the 13-\n\n\ndimensional pattern space. This means that this proximity measure evaluates scaled distances \n\n\nbetween patterns: ( )djdidjdid Nvvvv ??=? ** . Finally, it should be noted that a percent version of \n\n\nthe gij index is preferably used, that is, 100gij \u00d7 . \n\n\nA Grading Threshold    In GEPAT, the application of the proximity measure presented above \n\n\nis done, in a first stage, with the purpose of selecting a set of reference patterns, expected to, at \n\n\neast to some degree, represent an equivalent number of clusters in the data, and, thus, required \n\n\nto be different from each other by a corresponding amount. For that end, an upper threshold \n\n\n(T0) is imposed on the value of the grade when evaluated between pairs of prospective \n\n\nreference patterns (this process is presented below in more detail). \n\n\nIn summary, using the basic concepts presented above, it can be said that GEPAT is a \n\n\nprototype-based technique intended for complete and exclusive partitional clustering, resorting \n\n\nto a similarity proximity measure constrained by an upper threshold. \n\n\n- 4 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 The basic GEPAT algorithm \n\n\nThe first part of the application of GEPAT to a dataset of patterns is relatively straightforward, \n\n\nand can be divided into the following four steps: \n\n\n1: Selection of a Starting Reference Pattern (SRP) \n\n\n2: Formation of a set of Reference Patterns (RPs) \n\n\n3: Assignment of each pattern to the most similar RP \n\n\n4: Computation of the cluster centroids (Centroid Patterns [CPs]) \n\n\nThe SRP from the first step (1:) is an actual pattern, and can be randomly selected among the \n\n\npatterns that form the dataset being analyzed. In practice, the first available pattern of the \n\n\nseasonal record of TCC has been chosen as the SRP. At step 2:, an iteration on the entire \n\n\ndataset is performed, aimed at finding RPs in addition to the SRP. The iteration starts with the \n\n\nSRP as a reference pattern, against which the other patterns are graded using the GEPAT \n\n\nproximity measure of similarity. The order used for the iteration corresponded to the temporal \n\n\norder of the dataset patterns, as they were obtained during the season. If a pattern is found to be \n\n\nsimilar to the SRP by less than a specified threshold (e.g., T0 = 20 %) it is classified as a new \n\n\nRP. The iteration proceeds, and an additional RP is determined every time a pattern grades by \n\n\nless than the specified threshold against each and every one of the RPs gathered until that \n\n\npoint. At the end of the iteration, together, the SRP and all the additional RPs, form the final \n\n\nset of Reference Patterns. Note that no constraint is imposed on the total number of RPs found \n\n\n(this number is a function of T0, SRP, and the order chosen for the iteration sequence). For the \n\n\nassignment process that takes place at step 3:, all patterns in the dataset are graded against each \n\n\none of the RPs selected in the previous step (2:), and assigned to the RP that gives the highest \n\n\ngrade, that is, the RP most similar to it. Finally, at step 4:, two basic statistics are obtained for \n\n\neach one of the RPs (clusters) found: the representativeness, calculated as the percentage of \n\n\npatterns assigned to a given RP, relative to the total number of patterns in the dataset; and a \n\n\nsecond statistics, corresponding to the average (mean) of all the patterns assigned to a given \n\n\nRP, called the Centroid Pattern (CP), and representing the centroid (center) of the \n\n\ncorresponding cluster of patterns. It should be noted that, with GEPAT, no empty clusters are \n\n\nformed, since all RPs will at least be singletons \u2013 given the fact that to a RP is assigned, at \n\n\nleast, the corresponding pattern. \n\n\n- 5 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Partitioning evaluation \n\n\nHaving obtained a GEPAT clustering using the basic algorithm introduced above, it would be \n\n\nimportant to gain some insight on the adequacy of its partitioning. Ideally, this should be done \n\n\nin an objective fashion resorting to quantitative information extracted from the clustering itself. \n\n\nThough still not a well-developed, or extensively used, part of cluster analysis, a number of \n\n\napproaches have been developed for cluster evaluation (also called cluster validation). This \n\n\nsection presents the first stage of GEPAT's optimization procedure. In fact, contrary to \n\n\ntraditional practice, cluster evaluation is at the core of this new technique. \n\n\nClustering Criteria and Objective Functions    The development of any prototype-based \n\n\npartitional clustering entails the adoption of some kind of clustering criterion amenable to \n\n\nquantification. This criterion can also be viewed as an objective function that expresses the \n\n\ngoal of the clustering. Essentially, it is expected that this function be a single diagnostic \n\n\nmeasure of the overall goodness of a partitioning, so that the relative merits of two clusterings \n\n\nof the same data can be inferred by comparing the values of the measure for each clustering. \n\n\nFor GEPAT, the goal could be stated as the maximization of the grades of each pattern versus \n\n\nthe most similar centroids, so that the best clustering would be the one with the highest overall \n\n\n(e.g., mean) grade. This would suffice, but, as detailed below, in defining an objective \n\n\nfunction, GEPAT goes beyond this relatively simple approach. \n\n\nTwo Basic Statistics    The introduction of two additional basic concepts seems appropriate at \n\n\nthis point: the size of a clustering (K), and the size of a cluster (Si). K is the total number of \n\n\nclusters found by a cluster analysis, and Si is the number of patterns in a given cluster (which \n\n\ncan also be given as a representativeness percentage [Si%], as defined above in the fourth step \n\n\nof the basic GEPAT algorithm). \n\n\nIndices of Cluster Validity    Cluster validation typically resorts to statistically-based indices, \n\n\nand numerical measures, applied to inspect various aspects of a clustering structure, and aimed \n\n\nat an objective judgement of the corresponding partitioning. These indices can be classified as \n\n\nunsupervised (or internal), or supervised (or external) evaluation measures, depending, \n\n\nrespectively, on their use of information exclusively present in the data set, or information \n\n\nfrom sources external to the data set. When specifically applied for the purpose of comparing \n\n\ndifferent clusterings, or different clusters, these measures (internal or external) are called \n\n\nrelative indices. In the current application of GEPAT, only unsupervised measures are used, in \n\n\n- 6 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncombination, and in a relative-index framework. Note, finally, that internal indices can be \n\n\nfurther categorized into measures of cluster cohesion (tightness, compactness), and measures \n\n\nof cluster separation (isolation). While the former indicate how much alike the patterns in a \n\n\ncluster are, the latter translate the degree of isolation between a cluster and other clusters. As \n\n\nwill be seen below, GEPAT presents alternative indices that may not directly fit in any of these \n\n\ntwo categories. \n\n\nThe Singleton Index (SI)    This index is defined for a given clustering as the ratio between \n\n\nthe number of clusters with more than one pattern assigned to it (or, equivalently, all GEPAT \n\n\nclusters that remain if the singleton clusters are disregarded) and the size of the clustering (K). \n\n\nSI is a continuous measure with values on a 0 to 1 scale. \n\n\nThe Cluster Grade (CG)    The Cluster Grade is the mean value of the grades between each \n\n\npattern in a cluster and the corresponding RP. CG varies continuously on a 0 % to 100 % scale. \n\n\nThe Mean CP Grade (MG)    An overall grade for the CPs in a clustering, MG is defined as \n\n\nthe mean of the CGs from all the clusters. To some extent, MG offers insight on the global \n\n\ndegree of cluster cohesion. \n\n\nThe CPs' Degree of Dissimilarity (DD)    The first step to obtain this quantity is the \n\n\ncalculation of the grades for all the pairs of CPs that can be formed by combining all the CPs \n\n\nof a clustering two-by-two. The mean value of these grades, called the CPs' Degree of \n\n\nSimilarity (DS), is then subtracted from 100 to give GEPAT's DD, a 0 % to 100 % continuous \n\n\nmeasure that, at least in a first approximation, can be seen as an unsupervised measure of the \n\n\noverall degree of separation between the clusters. \n\n\nThe Smoothness of the Cluster-Size Distribution (SS)    This measure uses the size of the \n\n\nindividual clusters in the form of representativeness percentages (Si%, defined above), firstly to \n\n\nevaluate what is here called the Absolute Roughness of the cluster-size distribution (AR), \n\n\ndefined below in Eq. (A.2). AR can be seen as the sum of the areas of rectangles with width b, \n\n\nand heights (hSi%) given by the difference between the highest value of cluster \n\n\nrepresentativeness (S0%) and the representativeness of a particular cluster (Si%): \n\n\n \n\n\n?\n=\n\n\n=\nK\n\n\ni\nihSbAR\n\n\n1\n% (A.2) \n\n\n \n\n\n- 7 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere K is the size of the clustering. Because AR can be greater than 100 %, a factor to \n\n\nnormalize the absolute roughness (fNR) is used. fNR is evaluated using the same equation for \n\n\nAR (Eq. A.2), but for a theoretical situation in which a clustering with the same size K would \n\n\nhave a S0% of 100 %, and consequently, Si% equal to 0 % for all the other K-1 clusters. This is \n\n\nonly an abstract generalization, since a value S0% = 100 % could only correspond to a situation \n\n\nwith K = 1. Equation (A.2) would then take the form: \n\n\n \n\n\n( )[ ]1100 ?= KbfNR (A.3) \n\n\n \n\n\nwhere K-1 results from the fact that the rectangle corresponding to S0% (equal to 100 %, in the \n\n\nabstract case) has a height hS0% equal to 0 % (and would not contribute any area to fNR). \n\n\nDividing AR by fNR, and multiplying the result by 100, gives a degree of Normalized \n\n\nRoughness (dNR) calculated as: \n\n\n \n\n\n( )\n( )?\n\n\n=\n\n\n?\n?\n\n\n=\nK\n\n\ni\niSSK\n\n\ndNR\n1\n\n\n0 %%1\n1 (A.4) \n\n\n \n\n\nFinally, the smoothness of the cluster-size distribution is simply:  \n\n\n \n\n\n(A.5) dNRSS ?=100\n\n\n \n\n\nSS is a 0 % to 100 % continuous measure. \n\n\nA Global Index of Clustering Validity (G)    Plainly put, the maximization of either MG or \n\n\nDD, could, single-handedly, be used as the basic criteria for GEPAT's objective function. \n\n\nHowever, not only those two important measures of cluster validity (respectively for cohesion, \n\n\nand for separation) are used in combination, but, information from other two unsupervised \n\n\nmeasures (SI and SS) is also included in the computation of GEPAT's global index of \n\n\nclustering validity (G). Using the same notation as above, G is calculated as follows: \n\n\n \n\n\n( ) SSSIDDMGG +\n?\n?\n?\n\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n\n\u00d7??\n?\n\n\n??\n?\n\n\n+=\n2\n1\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\n(A.6) \n\n\n- 8 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Eq. (A.6), the average between the two more traditional measures (MG and DD) is \n\n\nmultiplied by the Singleton Index (SI), and the linear average between this result and the \n\n\nSmoothness of the Cluster Size Distribution (SS), is then the final value for G. From the \n\n\ndefinitions of the four indices used in Eq. (A.6), it can be expected that, for instance, the lower \n\n\nthe SI, the higher MG will be, since the (undesired) singleton clusters contribute to MG with a \n\n\nCG of 100 %. \n\n\nSummarizing, GEPAT\u2019s goal is then stated as the maximization of this global index (G), such \n\n\nthat, the best one of two clusterings is the one with the highest G (again, the indices of \n\n\nclustering validity are used in GEPAT, typically, as relative indices). \n\n\n5 Iterating for the remaining partitionings \n\n\nA recurring issue with prototype-based partitional techniques has to do with the sensitiveness \n\n\nof the objective function to the initialization of the cluster analysis. Indeed, in addition to the \n\n\nfact that these techniques converge to a final clustering that often only offers a local extreme of \n\n\nthe objective function (a maximum, or a minimum, depending on the specific clustering \n\n\ncriterion), the results are generally different for different sets of initial centroids, or RPs, in \n\n\nGEPAT terminology. \n\n\nTheoretically, this problem could be solved by evaluating the chosen objective function for all \n\n\npossible partitions (e.g., of a specified size K, as in K-means, or, in GEPAT terms, associated \n\n\nwith all possible SRPs [even if not actual patterns, thinking about an abstract application of \n\n\nGEPAT] and a specified T0), and pick the one that optimizes the function. This seems \n\n\nstraightforward, but is impractical due to the astronomical number of partitions, even for \n\n\nrelatively small data sets. \n\n\nSeveral approaches to limit the number of partitions to be evaluated, and for the selection of \n\n\ninitial centroids, have been proposed, and discussed, in the literature (e.g., selecting the initial \n\n\ncentroids from random samples of patterns). In the currently implemented version, GEPAT \n\n\nobjectively suggests a specific set of such experiments, whose number is tied to the number of \n\n\npatterns in the dataset. More precisely, what is proposed is, to perform as many runs of the \n\n\nbasic GEPAT algorithm, as the number of patterns in the dataset, by using, in each run, a \n\n\ndifferent pattern as a SRP (step 1: of the basic algorithm presented previously). The role of \n\n\n- 9 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEPAT's global index of clustering validity, G, as a relative index is then, to help pick the \n\n\npartitioning for which it is optimized (the one with the highest G). \n\n\nG Disambiguation    It cannot be ruled out that two, or more, GEPAT clusterings of a given \n\n\ndataset, and for a specified grading threshold T0, end up having the same value for the global \n\n\nindex G. In these cases, a strategy has been adopted, in which the values of the individual \n\n\nterms in Eq. (A.6) are closely inspected for the purposes of G disambiguation. At this point in \n\n\nGEPAT's development, and for the particular dataset with the (JJA) seasonal record of TCC \n\n\nalong the GPCI cross section, the disambiguation procedure is as follows: 1) if between two \n\n\nclusterings with the same G, all the terms in Eq. (A.6) have the same respective value in both \n\n\nclusterings, then the clustering corresponding to the SRP obtained earlier in the record \n\n\nsequence is picked as the final solution of the cluster analysis; 2) if, on the other hand, there are \n\n\ndifferences in the values of the individual terms in Eq. (A.6), the choice for the final solution \n\n\nwill be, firstly, the clustering for which SI is highest, or, additionally, if there is still more than \n\n\none clustering with the same highest SI, the clustering for which MG, DD, and finally SS, are \n\n\nhighest, if at any point in the evaluation sequence there is still the need for further \n\n\ndisambiguation; 3) finally, if still, two or more clusterings share the same extreme value for SS, \n\n\nthen again, as in 1), the clustering corresponding to the SRP obtained earlier in the record \n\n\nsequence is picked as the final solution of the cluster analysis. \n\n\n6 Basic thresholding \n\n\nKnowing that the final solution mentioned above is the result of the application of GEPAT \n\n\nusing a specific grading threshold T0, it seems pertinent to, for a given data set, inquire on the \n\n\ncharacteristics of the final solution for different grading thresholds, namely in what concerns \n\n\nthe values attained by the different measures of cluster validity that are used in the calculation \n\n\nof G. \n\n\nFor that end, it is current practice with GEPAT, to perform what is here referred to as Basic \n\n\nThresholding. It is no more than obtaining the final GEPAT solution for several grading \n\n\nthresholds between 0 % and 100 %, in a number that will depend on the needs of the particular \n\n\nclustering investigation (e.g. 5 % T resolution). \n\n\n7 Choosing a particular clustering (K0) \n\n\n- 10 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor practical reasons, it may be of interest to look at particular clusterings, namely in what \n\n\nconcerns the total number of clusters in it, or clustering size. This is specially the case when \n\n\nthe goal is to look at the CPs from the cluster analysis of different datasets, and qualitatively \n\n\nevaluate them in an intercomparison framework. \n\n\nThrough the thresholding methodology presented above, GEPAT offers a way to perform the \n\n\nsearch for the desired clustering of size K0, by successively narrowing the thresholding \n\n\ninterval, and increasing the thresholding resolution, to find the T0 that gives a final GEPAT \n\n\nsolution of size K0. Note that, fixing the value of K, will, potentially, result in different T0 \n\n\nvalues for the final solutions of different datasets. \n\n\nMore generally, a first search usually allows K to vary on a specified range of values suitable \n\n\nfor the purposes of a particular investigation (as opposed to fixing it). This is typically \n\n\nperformed on a dataset to be used as the reference in the intercomparison effort (e.g., \n\n\nobservational data). The chosen K0 is then fixed for the other data sets. \n\n\nUsing the values of K, MG, DD, SI, and SS, obtained for a basic thresholding (e.g., with a 5 % \n\n\nT resolution), a sequence of steps to find the K0 clustering has been defined as follows: 1) \n\n\nrecord the T interval for which K is greater than 1 and lower than the total number of patterns \n\n\nin the data set (e.g., T = ]0 to 95[ %); 2) redefine the interval from 1), by taking its interception \n\n\nwith the T interval for which the measure SI is equal to 1 (e.g., T = ]0 to 45] %); 3) taking into \n\n\naccount the interval from 2), define the range of K values useful for the specific goal of the \n\n\ninvestigation (e.g., K between 3 and 8), and annotate the interception of the corresponding T \n\n\ninterval with the interval from 2) (e.g., T = [20 to 25] %); finally, 4) perform a higher-\n\n\nresolution thresholding of the T interval from 3) and pick the threshold T0 that offers the best \n\n\ncompromise between the different clustering validity measures; this T0 will then correspond to \n\n\na particular K0 (e.g., T0 = 25 % and K0 = 6). \n\n\nAs noted above, usually firstly obtained for the reference dataset, the value K0 is then fixed for \n\n\nthe other datasets of interest, when going through the four-step sequence presented in the \n\n\nprevious paragraph with the goal to search for the corresponding (K0) final clustering solutions. \n\n\nIn that case, step 4) is simply used for the choice of the K0-sized clustering corresponding to \n\n\nthe lowest value of T in the interval (this ensures that the clustering chosen will be the one with \n\n\nthe highest degree of dissimilarity [at least among the corresponding set of RPs]). \n\n\nOne alternative to the approach presented above would be to, instead, fix a grading threshold \n\n\nT0, and look at the differences between the GEPAT results of the different data sets. \n\n\n- 11 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 RPing \n\n\nA step further in the application of the GEPAT methodology, RPing is, in the general case, \n\n\nbased on the imposition of a user-specified set of RPs in substitution of steps 1: and 2: of the \n\n\nbasic GEPAT algorithm presented earlier. Note that: i) it is necessary that those RPs and the \n\n\npatterns of the dataset being investigated belong to the same pattern space; ii) there is no \n\n\ngrading threshold involved in RPing; and iii) RPing is performed in a single run of the basic \n\n\nGEPAT algorithm. \n\n\nMost notably, RPing can be used for the direct comparison of the clustering structure of two \n\n\ndifferent datasets by, for instance, imposing the RPs of a particular clustering of a reference \n\n\ndataset (e.g., obtained following the sequence of steps presented above in Choosing A \n\n\nParticular Clustering [K0]) as the basis for the cluster analysis of the second dataset. In this \n\n\nregard, RPing would be useful, for example, in the evaluation of how well model simulation \n\n\ndata clusters around a set of RPs from a particular clustering of an observational dataset of \n\n\nreference. Insight on the relative goodness of such a clustering could then be obtained by \n\n\ncomparing the various measures of cluster validity between the two data sets, in particular, the \n\n\ndistribution of the cluster representativeness (Si%) and the mean CP grade (MG). \n\n\nOther uses for RPing can be easily envisioned, specially in face of its various disguises. \n\n\nConventional and Nonconventional RPing    When the set of RPs specified in RPing is taken \n\n\nfrom the result of the regular application of GEPAT to a reference dataset (either from a single \n\n\nrun of the basic GEPAT algorithm, or from a final solution of the iteration through all the \n\n\npossible GEPAT partitionings, or even, from the choice of a particular K0 clustering), the \n\n\nRPing is called conventional. On the other hand, if the set of user-specified RPs has patterns \n\n\nsubjectively taken from a dataset (or several datasets), the RPing is said to be nonconventional. \n\n\nInsourced and Outsourced RPing    If among the set of specified RPs, one pattern (or more) \n\n\ncome from a dataset other than the one being subject to RPing, the RPing is considered \n\n\noutsourced. In contrast, when all the patterns belong to the dataset under evaluation, the RPing \n\n\nis considered insourced. Both, conventional and nonconventional RPing can be insourced or \n\n\noutsourced. \n\n\nThe Scaling Factor in RPing    As mentioned above, only a single run of the basic GEPAT \n\n\nalgorithm is used in RPing, with steps 1: and 2: of the basic algorithm being substituted by a \n\n\nset of user-specified RPs. This means that GEPAT's proximity measure is only used at step 3: \n\n\n- 12 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof the basic algorithm, for the assignment of each pattern in the dataset to the most similar RP. \n\n\nRecall now that, the scaling factor embedded in the equation of the proximity measure, \n\n\ndepends, by definition, on the standard deviation of the (vectorial) components of the dataset \n\n\npatterns. A relevant question is then raised in a RPing context: which standard deviation \n\n\ninformation should be used with the proximity measure at step 3: of the basic algorithm? \n\n\nAlthough there is no a priori convention on this, it is current practice to, for conventional \n\n\nRPing (outsourced or insourced), use in the evaluation of the proximity measure, standard \n\n\ndeviation information obtained from the same dataset as the (specified) RPs; and, for \n\n\nnonconventional RPing (outsourced or insourced), to use standard deviation information, \n\n\nexclusively, from the dataset being subject to RPing. \n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that, in the case of outsourced RPing (of any type) it can happen that \n\n\nsome of the external RPs end up resulting in empty clusters. This is contrary to what would \n\n\nhappen in a regular GEPAT application (for which, as previously explained, any cluster is at \n\n\nleast a singleton). No specific treatment of empty clusters is currently performed in GEPAT. \n\n\nThis is a matter left for future developments of the technique. \n\n\nFrom what was presented above, RPing could also be classified as forced cluster partitioning. \n\n\n9 Space and time requirements \n\n\nDepending on the specific application, and dataset parameters, GEPAT will require differing \n\n\namounts of computer memory and computational time. A quick hint on the magnitude of those \n\n\noperational  requirements is given below. In what follows, m is the total number of patterns in \n\n\na dataset, n is the number of dimensions of the pattern space (or the number of components of \n\n\nthe pattern vectors), K is the size of a clustering, or the corresponding number of CPs (K' \n\n\nindicates clustering sizes that may vary for different runs of the basic GEPAT algorithm), g is \n\n\nthe number of measures of cluster validity used to evaluated the clusterings, and l a number of \n\n\nspecific GEPAT experiments. \n\n\nSingle Run of the Basic GEPAT Algorithm    The storage required by a single run of the \n\n\nbasic algorithm is O((m + K)n + g). In terms of time requirements, there is a first iteration on \n\n\nthe entire set of m patterns for the formation of the set of initial RPs O(m?n), and then, K \n\n\niterations on the m patterns for the assignment of patterns to the \u201cclosest\u201d RP O(K(m?n)), \n\n\nwhich gives a total time O((K + 1)m*n). \n\n\n- 13 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the Final GEPAT Solution    As mentioned above, the determination of the final \n\n\nGEPAT solution for a dataset of m patterns requires m runs of the basic algorithm, one for each \n\n\none of the patterns in the dataset. The storage required will then be O(m?n + m(K'?n + g)) and, \n\n\nfor the same reason, the time requirements will be O(m2?n(K' + 1)). \n\n\nThresholding Experiments    GEPAT thresholding is typically performed with the goal of \n\n\nfinding a particular clustering of size K0. For that end, a number of experiments are usually \n\n\nneeded, each for a different value of the grading threshold. Individually, these experiments are \n\n\nintended to give a final GEPAT solution  for the respective grading threshold. Being l the total \n\n\nnumber of such experiments, the space requirements of the thresholding is then O(m?n + \n\n\nl?m(K'?n + g)), and the time requirements O(l*m2*n(K' + 1)). \n\n\nTaking into account that K and K' increase to m as the grading threshold T increases to 100 %, \n\n\nand recalling that a basic thresholding (T = 0 % to T = 100 % [e.g., 5 % by 5 %]) is usually \n\n\nrecommended for an initial general overview of the clustering nature of a dataset, it can be \n\n\nconcluded that the current version of GEPAT can easily become computationally expensive, \n\n\nspecially for large datasets (m). \n\n\n10 Additional remarks \n\n\nT0 = 0 % and the Best-Liked Record    Whenever the basic GEPAT algorithm is run using a \n\n\ngrading threshold T0 of 0 %, the result is a clustering of size 1, that is, a single cluster is \n\n\nformed, whose size is the total number of patterns in the dataset (recall the second step of the \n\n\nbasic algorithm, 2: Formation of a set of Reference Patterns [RPs]). In other words, any SRP \n\n\nwould necessarily become the sole RP of the analysis. Under these circumstances, any change \n\n\nin the value of G as evaluated for different runs of the basic algorithm using different SRPs, \n\n\ncan only be attributed to changes in the value of the MG measure, since all the other indices of \n\n\ncluster validity involved in the computation of G, namely, DD, SI, and SS, remain unchanged \n\n\nat 0 %, 1, and 100 %, respectively. It can then be concluded that the final GEPAT solution for \n\n\nthe dataset (the one with the highest G among the clustering results for all the dataset patterns \n\n\ntaken as SRPs) will (for T0 = 0 %) be the one for which MG is the highest. As MG is, in this \n\n\ncase, simply the mean value of the grades between each pattern in the dataset and the pattern \n\n\nused as the SRP, the pattern behind this SRP can then be said to be, overall, the one \u201cbest-\n\n\nliked\u201d by (or more \u201csimilar\u201d to) the rest of the pattern population. Note that this pattern may \n\n\n- 14 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiffer from the CP of the pattern set as a whole. Interestingly, for T0 = 0 %, the CP is, for the \n\n\nfocus dataset, simply, the mean seasonal value of the TCC field along the GPCI cross section, \n\n\nas it is traditionally evaluated (e.g., Fig. 5.1). \n\n\nTsat and the Saturation Domain    Compared with the situation presented above for a grading \n\n\nthreshold T0 of 0%, the case of T0 = 100 % is at the other end of the GEPAT spectrum in what \n\n\nconcerns the total number of clusters proposed by the analysis. In that case, a clustering of size \n\n\nK, equal to the total number of patterns in the dataset, will be obtained, independently of the \n\n\nSRP used. Each individual cluster will then correspond to a singleton (Si = 1). In fact, it often \n\n\nhappens that this is (still) the case for thresholds lower than 100 %, and all the way down to \n\n\nwhat is, in GEPAT, called the saturation threshold, Tsat, defined, precisely, as the lowest \n\n\ngrading threshold for which the resulting clustering is of size K. The T domain between Tsat \n\n\nand T = 100 % is known as the saturation domain. For any threshold T in this domain, the \n\n\nmeasures SI, and SS will always be 0, and 100 %, respectively, which, according to Eq. (A.6), \n\n\nresults in a constant global index G of 50 %. Note also, that MG will remain at 100 % in the \n\n\nsaturation domain (singletons have CGs of 100 %). For the DD measure, although it is constant \n\n\ntoo, its value will depend on the dissimilarity degree evaluated among all the individual \n\n\npatterns of the dataset, which makes it, in this particular context, an interesting measure to look \n\n\nat, when comparing the potential clustering nature of different datasets. Finally, keep in mind \n\n\nthat Tsat corresponds to an upper limit of the value of the GEPAT's proximity measure for a \n\n\ngiven dataset, in the sense that the grade between any two patterns in the dataset will always be \n\n\nlower than Tsat. The less \u201csimilar\u201d the dataset patterns, the lower the Tsat. \n\n\n? for DD    Given the fact that to calculate the CPs\u2019 degree of dissimilarity, DD, there is the \n\n\nneed to compare the entire set of (K) CPs of a clustering against each other using the proximity \n\n\nmeasure in Eq. (A.1), it could be argued that the standard deviations (?d) to be used in the \n\n\nevaluation of gij for DD, should be obtained for this particular set of patterns, that is, from the \n\n\nvariability of each one of the n components of the CP patterns themselves. Using, instead, the \n\n\n?d calculated from the entire set of patterns in the dataset being analyzed (as is done in this \n\n\nstudy), implies only an approximation to that theoretically more precise evaluation of gij. Note \n\n\nthough, that the larger the clustering size, K, the closer will the ?d obtained from the set of CPs \n\n\nbe to the ?d obtained from the dataset as a whole (and, hence, more accurate the approximate \n\n\nversion of gij will be). This is particularly true for any clustering obtained for a grading \n\n\nthreshold T in the saturation domain, since each dataset pattern will itself be a CP, and, \n\n\nconsequently, both ?d versions will coincide. \n\n\n- 15 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexibility or Subjectivity?    It is apparent, from what has this far been disclosed about \n\n\nGEPAT, that (not just for the fact that it is still under initial development) it is amenable to \n\n\nadjustment in several of its operational aspects, e.g., the exact form of the proximity measure \n\n\nadopted, the number and type of measures of cluster validity, as well as their combination in \n\n\nthe equation for the global index, or the procedure for G disambiguation, among other things. \n\n\nThese aspects can (and should) all be subject to further testing and improvement. The point \n\n\nhere, though, is that GEPAT offers a great deal of flexibility, and that these, and any other \n\n\nfuture developments, can still be undertaken in the grade-based and purely-empirical \n\n\nframework it preconizes. \n\n\nOther Versions of GEPAT    The version of GEPAT introduced here is only one of a number \n\n\nof other versions developed up to date. More specifically, work has been done on two main \n\n\nversions of the proximity measure, one tailored for patterns corresponding to PDF distributions \n\n\n(PDF-based Absolute-departure Grading), and a second one built for patterns associated with \n\n\nspatial distributions of a given parameter (Field-based Critical-departure Grading). Either one \n\n\nof those two GEPAT approaches can be applied in a 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional context (or even \n\n\nin higher dimensions, in the PDF case). The PDF-based version has actually been developed, \n\n\nand tested, for a joint PDF (2D) framework, to study the clustering nature of a dataset made of \n\n\nTCC histograms much like the ones discussed in Section 5.1.2 (in fact, those jPFDs are made \n\n\nof 13 1D PDFs, one for each location along the GPCI cross section). The results analyzed later \n\n\nin this section, and in the next one, were obtained using the 1D, Field-based Critical-departure \n\n\nGrading GEPAT introduced in this thesis (the term \u201ccritical\u201d is derived from the use, in the \n\n\nproximity measure, of the max function, and a scaling factor, as in Eq. A.1). \n\n\n11 Future developments \n\n\nA number of modifications to a few important components of the novel grade-based approach \n\n\nto clustering presented here are listed below. These refinement attempts are part of a larger \n\n\ncatalogue of adjustments, whose implementation can potentially improve GEPAT, and, \n\n\nhopefully, make it less computationally demanding. \n\n\nThe Proximity Measure    As presented in Eq. (A.1), the grade-based proximity measure \n\n\nyields the same result for two patterns that have: the same number of components with the \n\n\nsame (&lt;1) value of the scaled distance versus the respective reference-pattern\u2019s components; \n\n\n- 16 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalong with the same number of components with a value of zero for the max function, \n\n\nindependent of the specific departure (versus the reference) of those components, beyond the \n\n\nrespective value of the critical factor (N?d). This congenital flaw could be overcome by \n\n\nchanging the proximity measure to the following one: \n\n\n \n\n\n?\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n? ?\n?= ?\n\n\n=\n\n\nn\n\n\nd d\n\n\njdid\n\n\nN\n\n\nvv\n\n\nn 1\nij\n\n\n1\n1,0maxg\n\n\n?\n(A.7) \n\n\n \n\n\nwhere (as in Eq. A.1) i and j are two patterns (j being a centroid, for instance), d represents the \n\n\ndimension in the pattern space, n is the total number of dimensions, vid and vjd are the dth \n\n\ncomponents of the vectors representing patterns i and j, respectively, ?d is the standard \n\n\ndeviation calculated from the variation of the values of the dth component among all the \n\n\npatterns in the dataset, and N represents the number of standard deviations to be applied. \n\n\nCPs instead of RPs for MG evaluation    As defined above, the mean CP grade, MG, is the \n\n\nmean of the CGs (Cluster Grades) from all the clusters in a given clustering. The CG, in turn, \n\n\nwas defined as the mean value of the grades between each pattern in a cluster and the \n\n\ncorresponding RP. Given the fact that a clustering is (for prototype-based techniques, as is \n\n\nGEPAT), ultimately, represented by its CPs, it seems more reasonable to redefine the CG and \n\n\n(concomitantly) the MG measures, so that they are, instead, calculated using the CPs as the \n\n\nreference. Note that MG would be the only measure affected by this adjustment, since DD is \n\n\nalready CP-based, and the other two measures (SI, and SS) are based solely on the size of the \n\n\nindividual clusters (a quantity that does not change with the new viewpoint). \n\n\nCPing    In line with the comments made in the previous item (CPs instead of RPs for MG \n\n\nevaluation), it would be important to adjust the RPing methodology so as to, alternatively, \n\n\nresort to CPs, instead of RPs. Keep in mind that what was said at Conventional and \n\n\nNonconventional RPing, Insourced and Outsourced RPing, and The Scaling Factor in RPing, \n\n\ncan be directly transposed to the CPing proposed here. \n\n\nGEPAT and K-means    In the basic K-means algorithm, an iterative, hill-climbing, \n\n\nmethodology is used to find the clustering solution, towards which the underlying process is \n\n\nintended to converge. The K-means clustering solution often corresponds to (only) a local \n\n\nextreme of an objective function. In fact, due to a number of issues regarding the sensitivity of \n\n\nthe algorithm to dataset parameters and cluster initialization, several experiments are usually \n\n\nperformed in K-means to find the most adequate clustering (e.g., change the [user-specified] \n\n\n- 17 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameter K, and choose the clustering that gives the \u201chighest\u201d value of an evaluation \n\n\nmeasure). With this in mind, and recalling the basic GEPAT algorithm, and its relative \n\n\nfrugality (time requirements O((K + 1)m?n), as discussed earlier), as compared to K-means \n\n\n(time requirements O(I?K?m?n), where I is the number of iterations required for convergence \n\n\nin the basic K-means algorithm), it can be concluded that the GEPAT experiments, that, by \n\n\ndefinition, are needed to obtain what was called the final GEPAT solution (see the notes above \n\n\non Iterating For The Remaining Partitionings), are, to a great deal, what can make GEPAT a \n\n\ncomputationally demanding technique. Nevertheless, recall once again, that, even for K-means, \n\n\nthere is, usually, the need for additional experiments, and thus, for multiple runs of its basic \n\n\nalgorithm, when investigating on the clustering nature of a dataset. That said, there seems to be \n\n\nsome interest in somehow merging these two clustering techniques. One way to do so would be \n\n\nto use a GEPAT-type initialization process (steps 1: and 2: of the basic GEPAT algorithm) in \n\n\nsubstitution of the random initialization of clusters often used in K-means, and, from there, \n\n\nperform a K-means-style, hill-climbing iteration for a clustering solution. This would also \n\n\nmean that K would depend on the grading threshold T0, on SRP, and on the order chosen for \n\n\nthe iteration sequence at step 2: of the basic GEPAT algorithm, instead of being a user-\n\n\nspecified parameter (with these characteristics, such a technique could still be called \n\n\n\u201cempirical\u201d). The final clustering solution for the dataset would then be secured following the \n\n\nGEPAT procedure established for that end. Basically, what is proposed with the merging of the \n\n\ntwo techniques substitutes steps 3: and 4: of the basic GEPAT algorithm by the basic K-means \n\n\nalgorithm, which would, necessarily, increase the computational time requirements of the \n\n\nmerged technique, relative to any of the two original ones (assuming that everything else \n\n\nremains unchanged). \n\n\nOther future developments of GEPAT can be anticipated. Some of which are concerned with: \n\n\na) a study of the consequences of using a grading threshold at stage 3: of the basic GEPAT \n\n\nalgorithm, a procedure that could potentially leave some of the patterns in the dataset out of the \n\n\npartitioning (this would make GEPAT go from being able to provide a complete clustering to \n\n\nbeing classified as [only] a partial clustering technique), and would, consequently, increase the \n\n\nvalues for the cluster evaluation measures CG and MG; b) making sure that the standard \n\n\ndeviation information needed in the application of GEPAT's proximity measure to evaluate the \n\n\nDD measure is updated for the specific set of CPs being intercompared (see the discussion \n\n\nabove at ? for DD); c) finding an objective way to deal with the empty clusters that may result \n\n\nfrom the RPing (CPing) methodology; d) reducing the time requirements of the operation of \n\n\n- 18 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe different GEPAT applications, e.g., by eliminating any redundancies in the process of \n\n\nchanging the SRP in Iterating For The Remaining Partitionings towards the final GEPAT \n\n\nsolution; e) refining the cluster validity measures, and their use in the estimation of the global \n\n\nindex G. \n\n\nAgain, along with the implementation of any of these ideas, careful testing needs to be \n\n\nperformed, namely, on datasets with distinct clustering nature, and resorting to a thorough \n\n\ninvestigation of cluster validity on a sound statistical framework, with the goal to infer and \n\n\nattest GEPAT's robustness. \n\n\n12 Case studies \n\n\nFigure A.1 shows the result of applying GEPAT with a threshold T0 = 0 %, to the JJA 1998 \n\n\nISCCP observational record of TCC along the GPCI cross section. As previously mentioned, \n\n\nthis particular use of GEPAT gives a final clustering solution corresponding to a single \n\n\npartition, associated with what was called the \u201cbest-liked\u201d pattern (the RP shown in Fig. A.1). \n\n\nRecall also that, for the T0 = 0 % case, the CP obtained is no more than the seasonal mean TCC \n\n\nalong the transect. Overall, the RP and CP found are similar, with the CP being a somewhat \n\n\nsmoother version of the former. The RP presents more pronounced local extremes of TCC, \n\n\nnamely, the higher values in the ITCZ (5\u00b0N to 8\u00b0N) and Sc (and beginning of the transition \n\n\nfrom Sc to ShCu, ~ 20\u00b0N), and lower values of TCC in the ShCu (14\u00b0N to 17\u00b0N), and to the \n\n\nsouth of the ITCZ.  \n\n\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n0\n\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\nThresh. = 0 %\n\n\nISCCP\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure A.1 - Total cloud cover fields along GPCI for the Reference Pattern (RP) and the Centroid Pattern (CP) \nobtained from the application of GEPAT with a threshold (Thresh.) of 0 % to June-July-August 1998 ISCCP data \n\n\n(see text for details). \n\n\n- 19 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the slight differences between the CP shown in Fig. A.1 and the ISCCP mean \n\n\nseasonal TCC in Fig. 5.1 arise from the fact that, in preparation for GEPAT, additional \n\n\nscreening was performed on the observational data as to eliminate records with bad values at \n\n\nany of the 13 positions in the cross section. \n\n\nIn Table A.1, information is presented, pertaining to the dataset of ISCCP TCC, and values of \n\n\nassociated GEPAT quantities, corresponding to the cluster analysis presented in Fig. A.1. \n\n\nRegarding the ISCCP data, the maximum number of good records (Maximum # of good \n\n\nrecords) and the number of good records found (# of good records found), indicate, \n\n\nrespectively, the expected number of TCC patterns corresponding to a three-month-long (JJA) \n\n\n3-hourly record (720), and the actual number of good patterns that passed the GEPAT \n\n\nscreening criteria as being adequate for the subsequent cluster analysis (563). For the cluster \n\n\nanalysis itself, the table lists the following items: the value of the grading threshold applied (T0 \n\n\n= 0 %); the record ID (in the 3-hourly seasonal sequence) of the starting reference pattern (SRP \n\n\n= 506); the size of the clustering (K = 1); the values for the four GEPAT measures of cluster \n\n\nvalidity MG, DD, SI, and SS (for the \u201cbest-liked\u201d record found, MG is ~ 42.2 %, and, as \n\n\nexpected, DD, SI, and SS, are equal to 0 %, 1, and 100 %, respectively); the final GEPAT \n\n\nevaluation, as seen in the value of the global index of clustering validity, G (~ 60.6 %); and \n\n\nfinally, the bottom portion of the table with only a single line of entries, where, rec, refpat, \n\n\npatcnt, patrep %, and patgrd % stand for, record (ID = 506 [the SRP]), reference pattern (001 \n\n\nindicates that the record has been used as a reference pattern), pattern count (also cluster count, \n\n\nSi = 563, i.e., all the [good] patterns in the dataset), pattern representativity (also cluster \n\n\nrepresentativity, Si% = 100 %), and pattern grade (also cluster grade, CG ~ 42.2 %), \n\n\nrespectively.

The respective \n\n\nresults are shown in Fig. A.2. As mentioned above, the results of a basic thresholding offer a \n\n\nbroad look at the characteristics of the (final) GEPAT solutions for different grading \n\n\nthresholds, namely in what concerns the values of the different measures of cluster validity \n\n\nused in the calculation of G, presented in the plot to the right. Apart from these numbers, the \n\n\nplot to the left shows the record ID of the SRP, and the size of the clustering (K) for each value \n\n\nof the grading threshold (as commented above, 563 is the total number of good ISCCP TCC \n\n\npatterns found). \n\n\n \n\n\nFigure A.2 - GEPAT basic thresholding with a 5 % threshold resolution applied to June-July-August 1998 ISCCP \nTCC data along GPCI: (left) Starting Reference Patterns\u2019 ID (SRP), and size of the clusterings (K), and (right) \n\n\nfour cluster validity measures (SS, DD, MG, SI), along with the values for the global index of clustering validity, \nG (see text for details). \n\n\nA striking feature of the results shown in Fig. A.2 is the variation of the SRPs corresponding to \n\n\nthe final GEPAT solutions for the different grading thresholds. Recall that these solutions are \n\n\nalready the outcome of the G Disambiguation procedure presented earlier, that, in the \n\n\nparticular case of the saturation domain (see Tsat and the Saturation Domain), gives the \n\n\nclustering solution associated with the first (good) record of the season as the final GEPAT \n\n\nsolution (1, for this dataset). In fact, ISCCP's Tsat is found to be 95 %, a conclusion reached \n\n\nfrom the values of K (563 at 95 % [562 at 90 %]) and SI (0 at 95 % [~0.002 at 90 %]). The \n\n\nbehaviour of K and SI is noteworthy too. K increases monotonously, and particularly rapidly, \n\n\nbetween the 50 % (K = 94) and 80 % (K = 520) thresholds, while SI decreases monotonously, \n\n\nand particularly rapidly, between those same thresholds (SI ~ 0.93, and ~ 0.07, respectively, for \n\n\nT = 50 %, and T = 80 %). For the other measures of cluster validity: SS is 100 % for 0 %, and \n\n\nsaturation domain thresholds, and has an absolute minimum of ~ 86 % at 25 %; DD is 0 % at 0 \n\n\n% threshold (as expected), jumps to ~ 50 % at T = 5 %, and stays between ~ 66 % and ~ 70 % \n\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0\n\n\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n\n\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n\n\nISCCP\n563\n\n\n   \n  K\n\n\n (\nnu\n\n\nm\nbe\n\n\nr \nof\n\n\n p\nat\n\n\nte\nrn\n\n\ns)\n\n\n \n\n\nS\nR\n\n\nP\n (\n\n\nre\nco\n\n\nrd\n ID\n\n\n)\n\n\nthreshold (%)\n\n\n SRP\n K\n\n\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n\n\nS\nI i\n\n\nnd\nex\n\n\n SI\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\nISCCP\n\n\n   \nva\n\n\nlid\nity\n\n\n m\nea\n\n\nsu\nre\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nthreshold (%)\n\n\n G\n SS\n DD\n MG\n\n\n- 21 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween 40 % and 100 % thresholds, with a maximum ~ 69.8 % at T = 70 %, and a value of ~ \n\n\n66.8 % in the saturation domain; MG has a value of ~ 42.2 % at 0 % threshold (as discussed \n\n\nabove [Table A.1 with T0 = 0 %, \u201cbest-liked-record\u201d, results]), shows an absolute minimum of \n\n\n~ 33.5 % at 15 %, from where it grows almost linearly all the way to the 70 % threshold (~ 96 \n\n\n%), and, as expected, approaches 100 % as the threshold approaches the saturation domain. \n\n\nFinally, the global index of clustering validity, G, is ~ 60,6 % at a 0 % threshold, has an \n\n\nabsolute maximum of ~ 81 % at 50 %, from where it consistently decreases (owing to the sharp \n\n\ndecrease in SI [recall Eq. A.6]) to a value of 50 % in the saturation domain. \n\n\nThe investigation turns now to finding particular clusterings for the purpose of the \n\n\nintercomparison of cluster analysis results among a number of different JJA 1998 TCC \n\n\ndatasets, namely, from observations, reanalysis, and model simulations. To accomplish that \n\n\ngoal, the four steps presented above at Choosing A Particular Clustering (K0) were applied, in \n\n\na first stage, to ISCCP TCC observations to find a clustering of a size reasonable for the \n\n\nqualitative intercomparison proposed in the context of this thesis. Assuming that any K \n\n\nbetween 3 and 8 would fit the objectives, the choice ended up being the clustering with K0 = 6, \n\n\nobtained for a grading threshold T0 = 23.6 % determined with the refined thresholding depicted \n\n\nin Fig. A.3. The other GEPAT quantities for this particular clustering are: a record ID = 207 for \n\n\nthe corresponding SRP; the clustering validity measures MG, DD, SI, and SS, with values of ~ \n\n\n42.7 %, ~ 58.1 %, 1, and ~ 84.6 %, respectively; and a global index of clustering validity G ~ \n\n\n67.5 %. \n\n\n22 23 24 25\n0\n\n\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n\n\nISCCP\n563\n\n\nS\nR\n\n\nP\n (\n\n\nre\nco\n\n\nrd\n ID\n\n\n)\n\n\nthreshold (%)\n\n\n \n\n\n SRP\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n   \n  K\n\n\n (\nnu\n\n\nm\nbe\n\n\nr \nof\n\n\n p\nat\n\n\nte\nrn\n\n\ns)\n\n\n K 0.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nS\nI i\n\n\nnd\nex\n\n\n SI\n\n\n22 23 24 25\n30\n\n\n40\n\n\n50\n\n\n60\n\n\n70\n\n\n80\n\n\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\nISCCP\n\n\n   \nva\n\n\nlid\nity\n\n\n m\nea\n\n\nsu\nre\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nthreshold (%)\n\n\n SS\n\n\n G\n\n\n DD\n\n\n MG\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure A.3 - GEPAT refined thresholding of ISCCP June-July-August 1998 TCC data along GPCI: (left) the \nparticular threshold, T0 (23.6 %), and clustering, K0 (6) found (indicated by the red lines), and (right, along the \n\n\nvertical red line) the corresponding four cluster validity measures (SS, DD, MG, SI), along with the values for the \nglobal index of clustering validity, G (see text for details). \n\n\nFigure A.4 shows the RPs and CPs for the ISCCP (K0 = 6) clustering discussed in the previous \n\n\nparagraph.

Keep in mind that these Si% are the weights to be applied to \n\n\neach one of the respective CPs in the weighted average that gives the CP for the dataset as a \n\n\nwhole (or equivalently, the CP for the clustering with T0 = 0 %), that, in this case, is the \n\n\n(traditional) seasonal mean TCC along the GPCI transect. \n\n\n \n\n\nFigure A.4 - GEPAT RPs, CPs, RPs\u2019 record ID (numbers in bold), and grading threshold (Thresh.) corresponding \nto the K0 = 6 clustering depicted in Fig. A.3, obtained for ISCCP June-July-August 1998 TCC observations along \n\n\nGPCI. \n\n\nAccording to the basic GEPAT algorithm, the RPs shown in Fig. A.4 are the initial set of RPs \n\n\nformed using the 207 pattern as the SRP. These RPs are then the ones to which the patterns in \n\n\nthe dataset are assigned based on the highest value of the proximity measure. This results in the \n\n\nformation of K clusters, whose respective CPs are the prototype patterns corresponding (in this \n\n\nversion of GEPAT) to the centers of the clusters. With this in mind, the CPs are viewed, and \n\n\nused, in subsequent investigations of the TCC field as the sole representatives of the GEPAT \n\n\nclustering. In this context, it is pertinent to comment on a number of features of the CPs \n\n\npresented in Fig. A.4, also because ISCCP is the reference dataset for what follows in this, and \n\n\nthe next section. Using the record ID as the reference for the plots, note that: in plot 031, the \n\n\nmost representative CP highly resembles the CP for the dataset as a whole (Fig. A.1) in what \n\n\nconcerns the evolution of the TCC field along the transect, with the main difference being an \n\n\noverall ~ 15 % higher TCC for all the locations south of 20\u00b0N (note also that the peak value in \n\n\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n0\n\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP031\n\n\nThresh. = 23.6 %\nISCCP\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n043\n\n\nISCCP\n\n\nThresh. = 23.6 %\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n207\n\n\nThresh. = 23.6 %\n\n\nISCCP\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n0\n\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n019\n\n\nThresh. = 23.6 %\n\n\nISCCP\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n380\nThresh. = 23.6 %\n\n\nISCCP\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n009 Thresh. = 23.6 %\n\n\nISCCP\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\n- 23 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Sc regions is in 031 ~ 95 % [at 29\u00b0N]); 031 is the only plot for which the ITCZ shows a \n\n\nTCC plateau (5\u00b0N to 8\u00b0N), while the other CPs tend to show a single peak at 5\u00b0N, 8\u00b0N, or even \n\n\n11\u00b0N (probably associated with the northward shift of the ITCZ during the JJA season); plot \n\n\n031 shows a relatively smooth TCC transition, going from the peak at 29\u00b0N to a local \n\n\nminimum at 17\u00b0N; in 043 there is, relative to 031, a general decrease in TCC in all the \n\n\npositions south of 23\u00b0N, but a consistently high Sc TCC with a value of ~ 90 % all the way to \n\n\n23\u00b0N, south of which it rapidly decreases to ~ 30 % at 11\u00b0N, a much steeper transition than in \n\n\n031, associated with a single-peaked (5\u00b0N) well defined, but less prominent ITCZ (~ 70 %); \n\n\nrelative to 043, the third most representative CP, shown in plot 207, essentially has Sc decks \n\n\nmore confined to the north, still a relatively steep transition going from the Sc to the ShCu, but \n\n\nhigher transect minimum values of TCC (~ 40 % at 14\u00b0N and south of the ITCZ); in plot 019 a \n\n\nrelatively important TCC peak (~ 75 %) in the ITCZ (8\u00b0N) is contrasted by a relatively flat Sc-\n\n\nto-ShCu TCC transition between, 29\u00b0N and 17\u00b0N (~ 70 % at 29\u00b0N, ~ 60 % at 20\u00b0N, and ~ 50 \n\n\n% at 17\u00b0N), although showing a ~ 80 % peak TCC in the Sc region, at 32\u00b0N (remember 019's \n\n\nrelatively low Si% ~ 6 %); for the least representative CPs in plots 380 and 009, the TCC is \n\n\nbelow 70 % in all the transect locations, the local peak associated with the ITCZ (at 11\u00b0N in \n\n\nboth CPs) is quite low (~ 55 % in 380, and below 40 % in 009), and lower than the peak values \n\n\nof TCC in the Sc; finally, note in 009, that its very shy ITCZ is associated with a relatively \n\n\nconsistent Sc deck, all the way to a peak just below ~ 65 % at 26\u00b0N, south of which the TCC \n\n\ntransitions relatively smoothly, with a rate similar to that in plot 031, to an absolute minimum \n\n\nof ~ 25 % at 14\u00b0N. \n\n\nFigure A.5 is the equivalent of Fig. A.4, but for ERA-40 TCC reanalysis data. As mentioned in \n\n\nChoosing A Particular Clustering (K0), after the determination of K0 for the reference dataset, \n\n\nK0 is used as a fixed parameter during the search for a clustering of the same size for the \n\n\nremaining datasets of interest (recall that, for ISCCP, the K0 determined [Fig. A.3] is equal to \n\n\n6). For ERA-40, a K0 = 6 corresponds to a T0 = 24 %. Again, the CPs shown are identified \n\n\nusing the respective RPs\u2019 record ID and are ordered by decreasing cluster representativeness, \n\n\nSi%, ~ 22.1 %, ~ 20.8 %, ~ 19.9 %, ~ 18.8 %, 12.5 %, and ~ 6 %, respectively for 027, 169, \n\n\n694, 047, 541, and 001. \n\n\nA first note on the ERA-40 results concerns the distribution of Si% among the different \n\n\nclusters. It is somewhat more uniform than in the ISCCP clustering, with a lower maximum \n\n\nvalue, and a value below 10 %, only for the least representative cluster. Compared to the CPs \n\n\nfor ISCCP, ERA-40\u2019s CPs depict, overall, a significantly more prominent ITCZ, and a less \n\n\n- 24 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnotorious decrease in TCC in the transition from the Sc to the ShCu regions. These two aspects \n\n\nare in line with the TCC field descriptions provided in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2. Keeping these \n\n\nidiosyncratic divergences in mind, there seems to be, however, an analogous general behaviour \n\n\nof the TCC fields when going from the CP with the highest Si% to the next two CPs in the \n\n\nsequence, namely, a lowering of the TCC in the transect regions characterized by the lowest \n\n\nTCCs (14\u00b0N to 20\u00b0N in the ShCu, and south of the ITCZ). Also, the TCC transition looks \n\n\nflatter in the third CP (694) than in the second CP (169), specially between 32\u00b0N and 20\u00b0N. \n\n\nAmong the CPs with Si% above 15 %, 047 (Si% ~ 18.8 %) is the one that shows the most \n\n\npronounced decrease in TCC in the transition regions, particularly between 26\u00b0N (where the Sc \n\n\npeak at ~ 80 % TCC) and 14\u00b0N (~ 40 % TCC). The CP in plot 541, shows the lowest TCC \n\n\nvalues for the two extreme north locations (~ 35 % and ~ 45 %, at 35\u00b0N and 32\u00b0N, \n\n\nrespectively), a situation that would correspond to a later development (in a Lagrangian sense) \n\n\nof the Sc decks, farther away from the coast of California (this happens 12.5 % of the time \n\n\nduring the JJA 1998 season [as inferred from the corresponding Si%]). In the least \n\n\nrepresentative CP, the ITCZ\u2019s signature is barely distinct, with a broad area (2\u00b0N to 11\u00b0N) of \n\n\nTCC values between 60 % and 70 %, below those in the Sc regions (this is similar to the \n\n\nsituation in the two ISCCP CPs with the lowest Si%). Finally, there seems to be (as for ISCCP) \n\n\na tendency for the ITCZ to show a single, more outstanding, TCC peak for the less \n\n\nrepresentative CPs, as opposed to showing two relatively close TCC values at 5\u00b0N and 8\u00b0N. \n\n\n \n\n\nFigure A.5 - GEPAT RPs, CPs, RPs\u2019 record ID (numbers in bold), and grading threshold (Thresh.) corresponding \nto a particular K0 = 6 clustering obtained for ERA-40 June-July-August 1998 TCC reanalysis data along GPCI. \n\n\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n0\n\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n027\n\n\nThresh. = 24 %\n\n\nERA-40\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n169\n\n\nThresh. = 24 %\n\n\nERA-40\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n694\n\n\nERA-40\n\n\nThresh. = 24 %\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n0\n\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n047\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\nThresh. = 24 % ERA-40\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n541\n\n\nThresh. = 24 %\n\n\nERA-40\n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n-1 2 5 8 111417202326293235\n\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n\n100\n\n\n RP\n CP\n\n\n001\n\n\nThresh. = 24 % ERA-40\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nto\nta\n\n\nl c\nlo\n\n\nud\n c\n\n\nov\ner\n\n\n (\n%\n\n\n)\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\n- 25 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conclude the analysis, it is imperative to present a close comparison of the values for T0, \n\n\nSRP, and the measures of cluster validity between the two GEPAT solutions discussed above. \n\n\nThe two K0 = 6 clusterings, for ISCCP, and for ERA-40, compare as follows (in respective \n\n\norder): T0 is 23.6 % and 24 %; SRPs' record ID are 207 and 694; MG is ~ 42.7 % and ~ 42.1 \n\n\n%, DD is ~ 58.1 % and ~ 47.9 %; SI is 1 for both; SS is ~ 84.6 % and 93.5 %; and G is ~ 67.5 \n\n\n% and ~ 69.2 %. Given the higher G, ERA-40\u2019s TCC data for JJA 1998 can, in this context, be \n\n\nsaid to cluster better around the respective (K0 = 6) CPs than ISCCP. Note that choosing in Fig. \n\n\nA.3, the clustering for T0 = 23.4, and K0 = 7, would increase ISCCP\u2019s G to ~ 69.3 %. \n\n\nThe search for a particular clustering of size K0 = 6 was also performed on 3-hourly JJA 1998 \n\n\nTCC simulated by the GPCI models. The results for a few of the models are presented in Fig. \n\n\nA.6, with the CPs, and in Table A.2, with the corresponding T0, Si% distribution, MG measure, \n\n\nand the global index G. Regarding Si%, among the eight models shown, the value for the most \n\n\nrepresentative CP is below 26 %, and the lowest value for the least representative CP (CP6 in \n\n\nTable A.2, typically above 8 %) is ~2 %. In terms of the MG validity measure, the lowest value \n\n\nbelongs to NCAR (~ 40 %) and the highest value to JAMSTEC (~ 49 %). The global index of \n\n\nclustering validity, G, is between M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's ~ 70.1 % and JAMSTEC's ~ 73.3 %. The \n\n\nresults correspond to clusterings obtained from a refined GEPAT thresholding, whose final \n\n\nchoices have, among these models, T0 values ranging from 23 % (M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France) to 31 % \n\n\n(NCEP). Note that for ETH/MPI the clustering shown has a K0 of only 5, since none of the \n\n\nrefined thresholding attempts yielded a clustering with 6 clusters. \n\n\nCP1 CP2 CP3 CP4 CP5 CP6 \nModel Si% \n\n\n(%) \nSi% \n (%) \n\n\nSi% \n (%) \n\n\nSi% \n (%) \n\n\nSi% \n (%) \n\n\nSi% \n (%) \n\n\nMG \n(%) \n\n\nG \n(%) \n\n\nT0 (%) \n\n\nECMWF 21.39 20.97 20.83 18.47 10.14 8.19 44.11 70.68 25 \nETH / MPI 25.69 25.42 23.19 21.67 4.03 nd 44.98 72.20 26* \nGFDL 25.00 21.81 20.56 18.33 12.08 2.22 48.24 70.65 27 \nJAMSTEC 21.11 19.72 19.17 15.97 12.36 11.67 49.37 73.30 28 \nM\u00e9t\u00e9o-France 20.08 19.11 19.11 18.27 13.67 9.76 41.51 70.14 23 \nNCAR 20.83 19.31 19.03 18.06 14.31 8.47 39.98 70.41 25 \nNCEP 21.73 21.03 16.43 14.48 13.37 12.95 48.71 72.10 31 \nUKMO 21.90 20.64 20.08 16.74 15.48 5.16 45.23 72.45 25 \nnd = no CP could be determined; * .2633786E+02 \n\n\n \n\n\nTable A.2 - CP representativeness (Si%), mean CP grade (MG), global index of clustering validity (G), and \ngrading threshold (T0) for (K0 = 6) GEPAT clusterings obtained for June-July-August 1998 TCC along GPCI \n\n\nsimulated by eight of the participating models. \n\n\nThe high TCC scatter seen in Fig. A.6 in all of the locations along the GPCI cross section, and \n\n\nfor any of the six CPs, is reminiscent of the situation in Fig. 5.1, for the seasonal mean TCC. \n\n\nQualitatively, CP1 seems to be the CP for which the scatter is, overall, lower, specially \n\n\n- 26 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween 23\u00b0N and 29\u00b0N (peak TCC values in the Sc regions), and at 8\u00b0N (ITCZ). Moreover, in \n\n\nCP1, apart from the differences in the TCC values in the deep convection region, an additional \n\n\nfactor contributing to the scatter between 2\u00b0N and 14\u00b0N is the discrepancy in the location of \n\n\nthe ITCZ among the different models, a situation less pronounced in the next 3 CPs (specially \n\n\nin CPs 2 and 4). CPs 2 to 4 show a better colocation in what regards the ITCZ, although with a \n\n\nhigher range in the peak TCC, as compared with CP1. In general, and more so in the first three \n\n\nCPs, the models show the typical features found in the seasonal mean TCC field, namely, \n\n\nhigher TCC values in the ITCZ and Sc, and lower TCCs in the ShCu and south of the ITCZ \n\n\n(M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, and to some extent NCAR, are the only models that consistently show this \n\n\nbehaviour in all of the six CPs). The main differences among the CPs are then mostly related \n\n\nwith the relative magnitudes of the TCC compared between each one of those regions, as well \n\n\nas the characteristics of the Sc-to-ShCu transition. Note, though, that there is no significant \n\n\nagreement among the models in terms of TCC changes going from the most to the least \n\n\nrepresentative CPs. \n\n\n \n\n\nFigure A.6 - For eight of the participating models, GEPAT CPs corresponding to a particular clustering of size K0 \n= 6 obtained for June-July-August 1998 TCC simulated along GPCI. \n\n\nIndividually, the models show some remarkable differences among the respective set of CPs. \n\n\nFor the sake of brevity only a few of the models are highlighted here.

For the NCAR model: it shows higher TCC \n\n\nin the Sc than in the ITCZ in three of the CPs (CPs 1, 3, and 4, with ~ 58 % combined Si%), \n\n\nand higher TCC in the ITCZ than in the Sc in two other CPs (CPs 2, and 5, with ~ 34 % \n\n\ncombined Si%), CP6 (Si% ~ 8.5 %) shows similar TCC values (~ 80 %) in both the ITCZ and \n\n\nSc; smoother and less pronounced Sc-to-ShCu TCC decreases are found in the two CPs with \n\n\nthe highest ITCZ TCCs (specially in CP5). In the seasonal mean in Fig. 5.1, the model from \n\n\nJAMSTEC shows: no apparent ITCZ peak, an absolute transect maximum of ~ 80 % TCC at \n\n\n17\u00b0N, and Sc TCC between ~ 45 % at 35\u00b0N, and ~ 70 % at 26\u00b0N. JAMSTEC's clustering in \n\n\nFig. A.6 shows: a broad area of consistently high TCC to the north of 5\u00b0N in both CP1 and \n\n\nCP6; in CPs 2 and 4, it has, comparatively, a not as wide area of relatively high TCC (higher in \n\n\nCP4 than in CP2), confined between 14\u00b0N and, 29\u00b0N in CP2, and 26\u00b0N in CP4; and a \n\n\nprominent TCC peak (~ 90 %) centered at 17\u00b0N in CPs 3 and 5, and notoriously isolated in \n\n\nCP5 (Si% ~ 12 %). Finally, for NCEP (the model with the second highest MG ~ 48.7 %): it is \n\n\nvery clear that there are big differences among the six CPs; disregarding the northernmost two \n\n\npositions in the section, there is, for CP1 (Si% ~ 22 %), a strikingly good agreement with the \n\n\nseasonal mean ISCCP TCC shown in Fig. 5.1; CP3 is the one that most closely resembles the \n\n\nmodel\u2019s seasonal mean TCC in Fig. 5.1 (though showing a lower ShCu minimum ~ 10 % at \n\n\n14\u00b0N, also the lowest among any of the CPs); CP2 (Si% ~ 21 %) is unique in the sense that, \n\n\ntogether with the highest of all ITCZ TCC peak values (slightly above 70 %), it presents, \n\n\noverall, the lowest TCC for the ShCu and Sc regions (17\u00b0N to 35\u00b0N) with a peak of ~ 25 % at \n\n\n23\u00b0N (the only southward decrease in TCC in this area is found between 20\u00b0N and 17\u00b0N); CPs \n\n\n4 and 5 (~ 28 % combined Si%), in contrast, have very low values of TCC in the deep \n\n\nconvection area (&lt;30 %) accompanied with peaks of high TCC in the subtropics (~ 80 %); \n\n\nfinally, CP6's broad area of relatively high TCC, between 5\u00b0N and 23\u00b0N, is a feature similar to \n\n\nthe one described for UKMO's CP6, although shifted north relative to the later by ~ 6\u00b0 (note \n\n\nthat NCEP's CP6 is ~ 2.5 times more representative than UKMO's CP6). \n\n\nOne important conclusion of the analysis presented in the previous paragraphs is that GEPAT \n\n\nseems useful in the identification of clusters of patterns in the TCC data investigated. These \n\n\n- 28 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatterns can be used as the basis for subsequent compositing of the model simulation results, \n\n\nwith the goal of better understanding underlying model deficiencies. Models, such as those \n\n\nfrom JAMSTEC and NCEP analyzed above, would, potentially, benefit from such an \n\n\napproach, that could also be applied in finding any compensating errors in models that score \n\n\nwell in terms of the (e.g., seasonal) mean fields. \n\n\nFinally, a closing remark on these results to stress that, only from the analysis of basic \n\n\nthresholding results it is possible to have a first notion on which grading threshold would offer \n\n\nthe best GEPAT clustering for a given dataset. What is shown in Fig. A.6, and in Table A.2, \n\n\ncorrespond to a request for a clustering of a very specific size K0 = 6, which may not \n\n\nnecessarily be the ideal K0 for any of those datasets. \n\n\nWith the goal to more directly compare the clustering structure of the ERA-40 TCC dataset \n\n\nwith the one obtained for ISCCP, a outsourced conventional GEPAT RPing experiment was \n\n\nperformed on the ERA-40 TCC, using, as a reference, the set of RPs from the particular K0 = 6 \n\n\nclustering from ISCCP analyzed above.

Specifically, the numbers for ERA-40 CPs\u2019 Si% are now ~ 31.5 %, ~ 28.8 %, ~ \n\n\n17.4 %, ~ 14.4 %, ~ 6 %, and ~ 1.9 %, respectively, for the CPs associated with the ISCCP \n\n\nRPs with record IDs 031, 019, 207, 043, 380, and 009 (the numbers for ISCCP, and for the \n\n\n\u201cunforced\u201d ERA-40 clustering are given above, in the discussion of Figs. A.4 and A.5, \n\n\nrespectively). \n\n\nIn what concerns the CPs, although between this clustering and the \u201cunforced\u201d one in Fig. A.5 \n\n\nthe two most r\n\n\nrespective fourth clusters, although to a lesser extent), important departures characterize the \n\n\nremaining clusters as (respectively) compared to each other. In fact, the numbers for MG and G \n\n\nshow that this RPing result corresponds to a slightly poorer clustering, as compared with the \n\n\n\u201cunforced\u201d ERA-40 clustering (MGs of ~ 40 % and ~ 42.1 %, and Gs of ~ 62.4 % and ~ 69.2 \n\n\n%, respectively), or with the ISCCP reference clustering (MG ~ 42.7 %, and G ~ 67.5 %). \n\n\nFinally, there seems to be, overall, a better agreement between the ERA-40 clusterings \n\n\n(\u201cforced\u201d and \u201cunforced\u201d), than between the ERA-40 clustering that resulted from the RPing \n\n\nand the ISCCP clustering that was used as the source of the RPs that initialized the RPing. \n\n\nThree concluding points before proceeding to the next section: i) in the future, the CPs \n\n\nrepresenting the clusterings will show \u201cerror bars\u201d indicating the magnitude of the stand\n\n\ndeviations of each one of the (vectorial) components of the patterns that belong to the \n\n\nrespective clusters; ii) the development of a more quantitative comparison between a clustering \n\n\nresulting from RPing and the reference clustering will be pondered; and iii) it would be \n\n\ninteresting to obtain, separately for each cluster in a given clustering, the TCC histograms \n\n\nproduced for Fig. 5.2. \n\n\nThe m in goal here is to describe the environmental conditions associated with distinct features \n\n\ntropical and subtropical NE Pacific ocean. A first step would have to do with the search for \n\n\npreferred spatiotemporal modes in the behaviour of the TCC field along the GPCI cross \n\n\n- 30 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsection. It was suggested that such investigation on the behaviour of the TCC field could be \n\n\nperformed resorting to a clustering methodology. The decision to follow this kind of approach \n\n\nled to the development of a novel cluster analysis technique (GEPAT), whose preliminary \n\n\nresults, discussed in the previous sections, seem adequate for the accomplishment of that goal. \n\n\nIt is in this context that ERA-40-versus-ISCCP GEPAT RPing results for TCC are used for the \n\n\ncompositing of key dynamical and thermodynamical variables believed to have an important \n\n\nrole in the maintenance and evolution of the cloud phenomenology in the GPCI region. The \n\n\nanalysis that follows tries to qualitatively infer potential impacts of the interplay of those key \n\n\nparameters, on the regime transitions that, generally, occur in maritime regions adjacent to the \n\n\neastern boundaries of the subtropical oceans. \n\n\nThe nonavailability of crucial observations (e.g., vertical velocity) on the 3-hourly temporal \n\n\nresolution needed for the study, is the main justification for the alternative use of reanalysis \n\n\npath (LWP), sea surface temperature (SST), and low tropospheric \n\n\ndata. Nevertheless, it was still tried to have some purely observational input, by resorting to \n\n\nclustering results from the GEPAT RPing of ERA-40 TCC based on RPs from ISCCP (the \n\n\nsame RPing discussed in the previous section and shown in Fig. A.7). The corresponding set of \n\n\nERA-40 CPs, and associated cluster partitioning, was used to guide the compositing of the \n\n\nother ERA-40 variables. \n\n\nFigure A.8 shows ERA-40 JJA 1998 seasonal mean fields of vertical velocity at 700 hPa \n\n\n(W700mb), liquid water \n\n\nstability (LTS) along the GPCI transect, together with section-averaged wind direction (direc) \n\n\nand speed. In each one of the six top panels shown, the means were calculated from data \n\n\ncomposited, respectively, for each one of the six clustering partitions of corresponding ERA-40 \n\n\nTCC data, that resulted from the RPing experiment presented in Fig. A.7 (based on a K0 = 6 \n\n\nISCCP clustering). Note that, as in Fig. A.7, the plots in Fig. A.8 are ordered left-to-right and \n\n\ntop-to-bottom by decreasing cluster representativeness (Si%). Additionally, the bottom plot in \n\n\nFig. A.8, shows the means for the season as a whole, included for reference. Note that the Si% \n\n\nvalues are the same ones presented earlier in the discussion of Fig. A.7 (recall that these Si% \n\n\nare the weights to be applied to each one of the respective composited means in the weighted \n\n\naverage that gives the traditional seasonal mean results shown in the bottom plot). Using the \n\n\nCPs presented in Fig. A.7 as a starting point, a comparative approach is adopted in the analysis \n\n\nof the composited results shown in Fig. A.8. The goal is to characterize how the associated \n\n\nenvironmental factors change going from one TCC CP to the next. \n\n\n- 31 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main differences between the TCC CPs in plots 031 and 019 (Fig. A.7). One is \n\n\nthe much lower TCC to the south of the ITCZ in 019 (at -1\u00b0N and 2\u00b0N), and the other is the \n\n\ndeparture in TCC in all points between 14\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N (ShCu and Sc), with values in the range \n\n\nof ~ 50 % to ~ 60 % in 019 (with a broad area of practically uniform TCC [~ 60 %] between \n\n\n20\u00b0N and 32\u00b0N), and ~ 55 % to ~ 75 % in 031. Note that the ITCZs peak at ~ 90 % in both \n\n\nplots. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n- 32 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFigure A.8 - ERA-40 JJA 1998 seasonal mean fields of vertical velocity at 700 hPa (W700mb), liquid water path \n(LWP), sea surface temperature (SST), and low tropospheric stability (LTS) along the GPCI transect, together \n\n\nL  \n\n\nwith section-averaged wind direction (direc) and speed, composited for each one of the six clustering partitions \ndepicted in Fig. A.7.

In the respective plots in Fig. A.8, the wind is more \n\n\nintense, and slightly more to the south, in 207, the LWP in 207 is much lower in the ITCZ, \n\n\nhigher to the north of it, until 23\u00b0N, and presents similar values to those in 031 between 26\u00b0N \n\n\nand 35\u00b0N.

Finally, though showing, to the most part, similar SSTs \n\n\nand LTSs, the LTS is slightly higher at 35\u00b0N in 207. \n\n\nTo conclude the analysis, 019 is, in a broad sense, the panel in Fig. A.8 whose results most \n\n\nesting to: i) analyze the \n\n\nresemble the results shown in the bottom panel with the seasonal means. Interestingly, a high \n\n\ndegree of similitude is also found between the corresponding TCC CP in Fig. A.7 and the \n\n\nERA-40 mean TCC in Fig. 5.1 (except for the southernmost and northernmost points in the \n\n\ntransect). One interpretation for this could be that, the insight offered by the (traditional) \n\n\nseasonal mean is somewhat limited in the sense that, in this particular case, it represents the \n\n\nview obtained from only ~ 29 % of the dataset records during the JJA 1998 season (deduced \n\n\nfrom the GEPAT representativeness of the respective TCC CP [019]). \n\n\nIn a future development of the work presented above it would be inter\n\n\nsame kind of results obtained for each one of the GPCI models; ii) extend the analysis to other \n\n\nseasons (separately or in combination), and include more years; iii) compare the results \n\n\nobtained for (cross sections in) different regions (e.g., the five subtropical maritime stratus \n\n\nregions identified in Klein and Hartmann [1993]), and for all such regions combined; iv) get \n\n\nthe RPs (or the CPs) for a particular (K0) clustering of the (e.g., cloud cover) data \n\n\ncorresponding to all the regions combined and perform subsequent RPing (or alternatively \n\n\nCPing) experiments using those same RPs (CPs) but for each region individually (e.g., for the \n\n\nsame time period used to get the reference RPs [CPs]), and compare the resulting Si% PDFs for \n\n\neach region; v) if what is proposed in iv) is performed with a tight constraint on the grading \n\n\nthreshold for the pattern assignment stage of the RPing (CPing) experiments (imposing this \n\n\nkind of constraint has not yet been tried, but is mentioned in Future Developments), a \n\n\n- 34 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomparison among the various regions, of compositing results of the kind of those discussed \n\n\nabove (Fig. A.8) could be done with added confidence; vi) extend the analysis to the broader \n\n\nregions that encompass the cross sections; and finally, vii) use (more directly) purely \n\n\nobservational data for as many variables as possible. \n\n\n14 References \n\n\nAnderberg, M.

The copyright to the materials published in AMS journals, \nmonographs, and other publications is transferred from the author of the works to the AMS at the \ntime it is accepted for publication allowing the AMS to act as the steward for the intellectual \nproperty contained in the published works. It also allows the AMS to protect the value of the \nmaterials in order to generate revenue for the AMS to support the peer-review publication \nprocess so crucial to the scholarly scientific endeavor. \n \n1. General Copyright Information \n \nThe recipient of an AMS copyrighted work is not free to copy it and distribute the copy without \nobtaining prior permission from the AMS. This concept has been the foundation of copyright \nprotection and continues to be the basic assumption of this policy. In addition, this policy \nrepeatedly refers to two additional basic assumptions. \n \n\n\n1) Transmitting an AMS copyrighted work through a computer network is a form of \ncopying. \n\n\n2) The AMS permits the use of links as a form of citation to its works. \n \nThis policy (and other related statements) will be reviewed from time to time and amended or \nrevised as necessary based on the experiences gained under its use and/or changes in the law. \nThe AMS Publications Commission plays a key role in helping to formulate AMS\u2019s copyright \npolicies. The AMS Council, however, must approve all such policies. This document supersedes \nall previous AMS copyright policies and any related statements. \n \n2. Copyright notice \n \nThe AMS requires that any republication of an AMS copyrighted work contain a copyright \nnotice.  The AMS copyright notice must be displayed on the first page of any AMS copyrighted \nwork that is published in print or on the first screen of a digitized work (such as a website). It is \nacceptable to place the string \u201c\u00a9 Copyright [date of publication] AMS\u201d as a hypertext link to the \nfull copyright notice. \n \n\n\nAMS\u2019s Full Copyright Notice \n \n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright [date of publication] American Meteorological Society (AMS). Permission \nto use figures, tables, and brief excerpts from this work in scientific and educational \nworks is hereby granted provided that the source is acknowledged. Any use of material in \nthis work that is determined to be \u201cfair use\u201d under Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSeptember 2010 Page 2 \n\n\nor that satisfies the conditions specified in Section 108 of the U.S. Copyright Act (17 \nUSC \u00a7108, as revised by P.L. 94-553) does not require the AMS\u2019s permission. \nRepublication, systematic reproduction, posting in electronic form, such as on a web site \nor in a searchable database, or other uses of this material, except as exempted by the \nabove statement, requires written permission or a license from the AMS. Additional \ndetails are provided in the AMS Copyright Policy, available on the AMS Web site \nlocated at (http://www.ametsoc.org/) or from the AMS at 617-227-2425 or \ncopyrights@ametsoc.org. \n\n\n \n \n3. Requirement for copyright transfer \n \nAs a condition of publishing a work with the AMS, an author must transfer copyright to the work \nto the AMS. This requirement may be waived for some materials. The copyright transfer \n(referred to as the assignment of copyright) becomes effective when an AMS editor or \nappropriate AMS staff member accepts the work for publication. \n \nOnce assignment of the copyright to AMS has occurred, authors must incorporate the AMS \ncopyright notice (see section 2) into any copy of the work made available to others. The AMS \nwill maintain the accepted version as the definitive version of the published work, as amended \nthrough editorial processing for publication. In the event that the AMS makes the published work \navailable electronically, authors who maintain personal electronic collections should implant a \nlink to the definitive version maintained by the AMS and should distribute only links pointing to \nthe AMS definitive version. \n \nThe copyright transfer forms are available on the AMS Web site  (http://www.ametsoc.org/) on \nthe \u201cAuthors\u2019 Resource Center\u201d pages.  There are several different copyright transfer forms.  \nNearly all authors will use one of the \u201cstandard\u201d copyright forms, and most will use the form that \nprovides for the transfer of copyright to the AMS by the author(s).  A separate form provides for \nauthors to sign a statement that the work was created as part of their official duties as a United \nStates government employee and is therefore precluded from copyright protection.  An \nadditional form is available on the AMS Web site for works subject to Crown Copyright.  A \nnumber of government laboratories have special copyright policies for contractors who work at \nthose laboratories, and the Authors\u2019 Resource Center Web site contains a set of forms specific to \neach of those laboratories. \n \nAll authors must sign the appropriate copyright transfer form or statement that the work was \ncreated as part of the author\u2019s duty as a United States Government employee or at the direction \nor control of any government department of any country. If there is more than one author of a \nwork, all authors must sign an appropriate form.   It is not sufficient for one author to sign on \nbehalf of coauthors.  Coauthors may all sign the same form or each sign a separate form.  \n \nThe AMS and many other publishers have a policy that authors submit a work for consideration \nfor publication to only one editor at a time. The authors must notify editors if a work is identical \nto or substantially the same as a work submitted to another publisher. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSeptember 2010 Page 3 \n\n\n4. Permission for use of copyrighted works of others \n \nAn author who uses the material of another author or copyright owner, such as a graphical \nimage, text, etc., is expected to obtain written permission from that author or copyright owner to \ninclude the material in the author\u2019s work and provide a copy of that permission to the AMS.  The \npermission must be broad enough to permit the AMS to distribute the material as contained in \nthe work in any and all media now known or later developed.  A sample permission form is \navailable on the AMS website in the Authors\u2019 Resource Center on the same page as the \ncopyright transfer forms. Note that some copyright holders provide a \u201cblanket permission\u201d \nsimilar to that of the AMS that allows use of figures, tables, and brief excerpts without written \npermission (see section 2).  No additional action is required of authors who make use of \nmaterials that fall under such blanket permission. \n \n5. Citation to AMS works using links \n \nThe AMS permits citations to its works through the use of links, and encourages the widespread \ndistribution of links to the definitive versions of AMS copyrighted works and does not require \nthat authors obtain prior permission to include such links in their new works. Execution of a link \nto view a work is considered permissible under these policies. Redistributing a copy created by \nthe execution of a link, however, requires permission from the AMS. In addition, entities or \nindividuals may not upload copies of AMS copyrighted works to a server for distribution by \nlinks without the permission of the AMS.  \n \nThe AMS considers it to be an infringement of its copyright if a series of links forms a pattern \nequivalent to the table of contents to an AMS publication or creates a compilation of AMS \ncopyrighted works. To avoid misunderstandings, individuals should consult with the AMS \nbefore duplicating a substantial portion of an AMS copyrighted work with links. \n \n6. Definitive copy of a work and Early Online Releases (EORs) \n \nThe AMS, in its role as steward, is obligated to ensure the work is permanently archived so that \nthe published research record will always be available to future generations.  This stewardship \nrole requires that the AMS maintain the definitive published version of any work published in an \nAMS journal and give permission to copy only true representations of that definitive version. \nThe definitive version is defined as the version that has been accepted by an editor, \nprofessionally edited, and provided to the community as the final published form in print and/or \nelectronic form in one or more formats that can be used to render the content. \n \nIn seeking to provide new research results to the research community as quickly as possible, the \nAMS provides limited access to an Early Online Release (EOR) of an accepted manuscript for \nthe period in which the accepted manuscript is being prepared for publication.  As soon as the \ndefinitive published version is available, it replaces the EOR version so that only the definitive \nwork can be accessed from that point forward.  EORs are not intended to be used as \nreplacements for the definitive published versions and, therefore, permission cannot be provided \nto post these almost-final versions on any non-AMS database or web site. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSeptember 2010 Page 4 \n\n\n7. Distribution from non-AMS database or web site \n \nCopies of an AMS copyrighted work may not be placed on a non-AMS database or web site \nwithout permission from the AMS unless provided for under this policy. \n \na. Distribution prior to submission \n \nThe posting of a draft manuscript on Internet servers, such as an \u201ce-print server\u201d or the author\u2019s \nhome page, provides an opportunity for increased communication among researchers.  The AMS \ndoes not want to inhibit this avenue of scientific exchange. At the present time, and as long as \ncertain requirements are met, the AMS treats such postings as informal publication and will not \nreject a manuscript that has been posted in this way on the basis of prior publication. \n \nThe AMS strongly recommends that authors choosing to post their work prior to submission post \nwith it a notice similar to the one shown below. \n \n\n\nSample of Notice \n \n\n\nThis document is provided by the contributing author(s) as a means to ensure timely \ndissemination of scholarly and technical work on a noncommercial basis. Copyright and \nall rights therein are maintained by the author(s) or by other copyright owners. It is \nunderstood that all persons copying this information will adhere to the terms and \nconstraints invoked by each author's copyright. This work may not be reposted without \nexplicit permission of the copyright owner. \n\n\n \nb. Distribution after submission but prior to editorial decision \n \nAn author who submits a work for consideration by an AMS editor should include the following \nnotice on any copy of the work posted by the author: \n \n\n\nThis work has been submitted for publication. Copyright in this work may be transferred \nwithout further notice, and this version may no longer be accessible. \n\n\n \nc. Distribution after editorial decision \n \nFor a work that was posted prior to the transfer of copyright to the AMS, permission is granted \nunder this policy for the work to remain available online until publication by the AMS provided \nthe following notice is included at the time the copyright assigned to the AMS: \n \n\n\nPermission to place a copy of this work on this server has been provided by the AMS.  The \nAMS does not guarantee that the copy provided here is an accurate copy of the published \nwork. \n\n\n \nAn author shall remove the work no later than the first of the month following the issue of the \nAMS publication containing the work.  Once the definitive version of the work is published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSeptember 2010 Page 5 \n\n\nthe AMS, entities or individuals operating databases of web sites may replace the removed copy \nof the work, at the discretion of the server operators, with an abstract from and/or a summary of \nthe work, along with a full citation to the AMS publication that can contain a link to the \ndefinitive copy of the work that resides on the AMS server. \n \nd. Open access institutional repositories \n \nThe AMS understands there is increasing demand for institutions to provide open access to the \npublished research being produced by employees, such as faculty, of that institution.  In \nrecognition of this, the AMS grants permission to each of its authors to deposit the definitive \nversion of that author\u2019s published AMS journal article in the repository of the author\u2019s institution \nprovided all of the following conditions are met: \n \n\n\n? The article lists the institution hosting the repository as the author\u2019s affiliation. \n? The copy provided to the repository is the final published PDF of the article (not the EOR \n\n\nversion made available by AMS prior to formal publication; see section 6).  \n? The repository does not provide access to the article until six months after the date of \n\n\npublication of the definitive version by the AMS. \n? The repository copy includes the AMS copyright notice. \n\n\n \n8. Permissions granted to its authors by the AMS \n \nThe AMS grants its authors the following permissions: \n \n\n\n? Permission to reuse any portion of the author\u2019s work, without a fee, in future lectures, \npress releases, or works of the author's own, provided that the AMS citation and notice of \nthe AMS copyright are included. \n\n\n? Permission to post a copy of the work on the author's personal homepage (that is, a Web \npage under the direct control of the author) on a non-AMS server for noncommercial \ndistributions, provided the AMS copyright notice (see section 2) is attached to the \npersonal copy and that it represents the definitive copy (see section 6). \n\n\n? Permission to have the work posted on open access institutional repositories under the \nconditions provided in section 7d.  \n\n\n? Permission for the author\u2019s employer to distribute copies of the work to other employees \nwithin the organization. \n\n\n \nThe assignment of copyright to the AMS does not affect the right of the author to seek patent \nprotection for any invention that may be disclosed in the work.   \n \n9. Republication \n \nThe AMS maintains a policy of not republishing works, whether copyrighted by the AMS or by \nothers, except under limited conditions where an editor determines there is significant benefit in \nrepublication. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSeptember 2010 Page 6 \n\n\n10. Edited collections \n \nIn most cases of conference proceedings and some other forms of collection, the collection as a \nwhole is copyrighted by the AMS, while the authors may hold copyright to the individual \ncomponents of the collection. \n \nNo collection in which the AMS is the sole or joint copyright holder may be posted for open \ndistribution without prior permission from the AMS. Notice of permission must accompany the \nAMS copyright notice. \n \n11. Permissions \n \nAll AMS journals and monograph publications are registered with the Copyright Clearance \nCenter (CCC) 222 Rosewood Drive, Danvers, MA 01923. The CCC provides an easy and \neffective means of obtaining permission for most uses of AMS copyrighted materials for a \nmodest fee. The AMS encourages use of the CCC for permission processing whenever possible. \nRequests for permission to use AMS copyrighted works can also be directed to the Director of \nPublications at AMS Headquarters, 45 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02108-3693; fax: 617-742-\n8718; e-mail: copyright@ametsoc.org. \n \n12. Interpretation of coverage \n \nThe AMS copyright transfer form grants the AMS all rights in the work, including, without \nlimitation, the right to publish the work in whole or in part in any and all media now known or \nlater developed."}]}}}
