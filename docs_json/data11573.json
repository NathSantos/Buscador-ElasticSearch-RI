No \nentanto, esses elementos apresentam elevado grau de toxicidade quando \ningeridos ou inalados, e s\u00e3o considerados perigosos quando presentes no meio \nambiente, devido principalmente ao fato de poderem reagir com mol\u00e9culas de \nO3, promovendo a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da camada de oz\u00f4nio. \n\nConsiderando a alta aplicabilidade dos halog\u00eanios e seus efeitos \nadversos ao ambiente e em sistemas biol\u00f3gicos, faz-se necess\u00e1rio o \nestabelecimento de m\u00e9todos sens\u00edveis, com exatid\u00e3o e precis\u00e3o, para a sua \ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nT\u00e9cnicas como eletrodos de \u00edon seletivos, cromatografia de \u00edons, \nan\u00e1lise por ativa\u00e7\u00e3o de n\u00eautrons instrumental, espectroscopia de fluoresc\u00eancia \npor raios-X, entre outros, foram propostos e aplicados com sucesso para analise \nde halog\u00eaneos em diversas matrizes, no entanto, em alguns casos, morosas \netapas de preparo de amostras s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias, al\u00e9m de algumas das t\u00e9cnicas \napresentarem limita\u00e7\u00f5es para analise multielementar, baixa sensibilidade, baixa \nfrequ\u00eancia anal\u00edtica, incid\u00eancia de interfer\u00eancias e curta faixa linear para \nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nAl\u00e9m de problemas para sua quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o, a medida de raz\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica \nde halog\u00eanios ainda \u00e9 um desafio. Algumas t\u00e9cnicas t\u00eam sido aplicadas para \neste prop\u00f3sito como a espectrometria de massas de raz\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica e \nespectrometria de massas por ioniza\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica, entretanto, normalmente \napresentam baixa precis\u00e3o al\u00e9m de apresentarem muitos dos problemas \napresentados para quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nDesta forma, o objetivo geral deste trabalho \u00e9 apresentar propostas a \nfim de solucionar os problemas enfrentados para an\u00e1lise de halog\u00eanios por \nespectrometria de massas por plasma indutivamente acoplado (ICP-MS) e \nanalise de raz\u00f5es isot\u00f3picas por multicoletor (MC)-ICP-MS, aplicando os \nm\u00e9todos desenvolvidos para o estudo de casos ambientais reais.  \n\nUma breve introdu\u00e7\u00e3o abordando os conceitos b\u00e1sicos sobre a \nimport\u00e2ncia dos halog\u00eanios, uma vis\u00e3o geral sobre funcionamento de \nequipamentos ICP-MS, determina\u00e7\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise isot\u00f3pica de halog\u00eanios por \nICP-MS \u00e9 apresentada no Cap\u00edtulo 1 o qual \u00e9 seguindo pelos Cap\u00edtulos 2, 3 e 4 \nonde se apresentam novas propostas para determina\u00e7\u00e3o de halog\u00eanios por meio \nda analise direta de s\u00f3lidos utilizando vaporiza\u00e7\u00e3o eletrot\u00e9rmica (SS-ETV)-\nICP-MS e aplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos m\u00e9todos propostos a analise de amostras biol\u00f3gicas, \nminerais e ambientais em diferentes estudos. O Cap\u00edtulo 5 apresenta o \ndesenvolvimento de um m\u00e9todo simples para determina\u00e7\u00e3o direta de Br em \namostras de pol\u00edmeros por abla\u00e7\u00e3o a laser (LA)-ICP-MS, enquanto que os \nCap\u00edtulos 6, 7 e 8 abordam o desenvolvimento de m\u00e9todos para medida da \nraz\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica de halog\u00eanios em \u00e1gua do mar e amostras de gelo marinho por \nMC-ICP-MS.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 2, uma nova metodologia para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de Cl em \namostras biol\u00f3gicas e bot\u00e2nicas usando SS-ETV-ICP-MS \u00e9 apresentada. As \namostras s\u00f3lidas foram pesadas diretamente em plataformas de grafite (copos \nde grafite da t\u00e9cnica cup-in-tube) e inseridas no forno de grafite. Os par\u00e2metros \nde potencial de r\u00e1dio frequ\u00eancia (RF) e a vaz\u00e3o de g\u00e1s carreador foram \notimizados em 1300 W e 0,7 L min-1, respectivamente.  \n\nPadr\u00f5es aquosos foram utilizados para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o da curva de \ncalibra\u00e7\u00e3o com o aux\u00edlio de modificadores pr\u00e9-secos (Pd + Nd ou Pd + Ca) ou \nutilizando um material de referencia certificado (CRM) s\u00f3lido com os mesmos \nmodificadores pr\u00e9-secos ou sem a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de modificadores. O limite de \nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o (LOQ) obtido foi 5 \u00b5g g-1 sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es otimizadas.  \n\nA concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Cl foi determinada em cinco amostras de refer\u00eancia \ncertificadas, com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es certificados para Cl, al\u00e9m de tr\u00eas amostras de \nrefer\u00eancia certificados com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es certificadas para Cl indispon\u00edveis, \nneste \u00faltimo caso, os resultados foram comparados \u00e0queles obtidos utilizando \nespectrometria de absor\u00e7\u00e3o molecular de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o com fonte cont\u00ednua \n(HR-CS MAS). As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas demonstraram-se em acordo, a um \nn\u00edvel de confian\u00e7a estat\u00edstica de 95%, com os valores certificados ou de \nrefer\u00eancia. \n\nO Cap\u00edtulo 3 apresenta um novo m\u00e9todo para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o direta e \nsimult\u00e2nea Br e Cl em amostras de carv\u00e3o utilizando SS-ETV-ICP-MS. O \nprocesso n\u00e3o requer pr\u00e9-tratamento de amostras e necessita de pequenas \nal\u00edquotas de massa de amostra (cerca de 0,5 mg). Todos os par\u00e2metros \noperacionais, incluindo vaz\u00e3o de g\u00e1s carreador e potencial de RF, foram \notimizados para o m\u00e1ximo de sensibilidade.  \n\nO uso de modificadores/ carreadores de aeross\u00f3is (Pd, Pd + Al e Pd + \nCa) foi avaliado e a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de Pd e Ca foi escolhida, permitindo a ado\u00e7\u00e3o \ndas temperaturas de pir\u00f3lise e vaporiza\u00e7\u00e3o de 700 oC e 1900 oC, \nrespectivamente. Cloro foi determinado com o auxilio de calibra\u00e7\u00e3o utilizando \npadr\u00f5es s\u00f3lidos, enquanto Br foi determinado tanto por calibra\u00e7\u00e3o aquosa \nquanto utilizando CRM s\u00f3lidos. Os LOQs obtidos foram de 0,03 \u00b5g g-1 para Br \ne 7 \u00b5g g-1 para Cl, interfer\u00eancias espectrais n\u00e3o foram observadas. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 4 foi avaliada a viabilidade da an\u00e1lise direta de s\u00f3lidos por \nHR-CS MAS para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de F e ETV-ICP-MS para determina\u00e7\u00e3o \nsimult\u00e2nea de Cl, Br e I em material particulado inal\u00e1vel no ar (PM10), \ncoletados na regi\u00e3o metropolitana de Aracaju, Sergipe, Brasil.  \n\nAs an\u00e1lises de F por HR-CS MAS foram realizadas monitorando a \nmol\u00e9cula de CaF que foi gerada a altas temperaturas na c\u00e2mara de grafite ap\u00f3s \na adi\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e1lcio em uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o Ca/ F de 35. As an\u00e1lises por ETV-ICP-MS \nforam realizadas utilizando Ca como modificador qu\u00edmico/ carreador de \naerossol com a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o concomitante de Pd como modificador permanente, a \nfim de evitar perdas de Cl, Br e I durante a etapa de pir\u00f3lise. \n\nA abordagem de analise direta de s\u00f3lidos resultou em LOQs adequados \npara a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de halog\u00eaneos em PM10, usando a calibra\u00e7\u00e3o por adi\u00e7\u00e3o de \nanalito ou calibra\u00e7\u00e3o utilizando um CRM solido. O m\u00e9todo permitiu a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos halog\u00eanios em 14 PM10 coletadas em uma cidade costeira do \nnordeste do Brasil. Os resultados demonstraram varia\u00e7\u00f5es de teor de halog\u00eanios \nde acordo com as condi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas, principalmente relacionados a \nchuvas, umidade e irradia\u00e7\u00e3o solar. \n\nO Cap\u00edtulo 5 foi destinado \u00e0 avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da LA-ICP-MS \npara an\u00e1lise de Br em amostras de pol\u00edmeros. Os par\u00e2metros operacionais do \nLA-ICP-MS, incluindo a vaz\u00e3o de g\u00e1s carreador, potencial de RF, tamanho da \ncratera de abla\u00e7\u00e3o e frequ\u00eancia do laser foram otimizados para o m\u00e1ximo de \nsensibilidade. Os valores otimizados foram 0,6 L min-1 para vaz\u00e3o de g\u00e1s \ncarreador (He), 950 W de potencial de RF, 120 \u00b5m de tamanho da cratera de \nabla\u00e7\u00e3o e 15 Hz de frequ\u00eancia do laser.  \n\nSob condi\u00e7\u00f5es otimizadas foi poss\u00edvel determinar, com exatid\u00e3o, Br em \n5 amostras certificadas de pol\u00edmeros e 5 amostras reais de pol\u00edmeros obtidas em \nestabelecimentos locais em Ghent, B\u00e9lgica por calibra\u00e7\u00e3o externa utilizando \nCRMs contendo diferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de Br e por calibra\u00e7\u00e3o externa \nutilizando apenas um CRM monitorando 12C+ como padr\u00e3o interno.  O LOQ \nobtido foi de 110  \u00b5g g-1 para Br. \n\nO Cap\u00edtulo 6 apresenta um m\u00e9todo simples para medida da raz\u00e3o \nisot\u00f3pica de Br em \u00e1gua do mar por MC-ICP-MS, utilizando nebuliza\u00e7\u00e3o \npneum\u00e1tica para introdu\u00e7\u00e3o da amostra. Os sinais dos is\u00f3topos de Br+ foram \nmedidos livre de interfer\u00eancias utilizando alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o. O efeitos de mem\u00f3ria \npara Br foi diminu\u00eddo utilizando  5 mmol L-1 NH4OH como solu\u00e7\u00e3o de limpeza \nentre as medidas. O conte\u00fado cati\u00f4nico da \u00e1gua do mar foi removido por \ncromatografia cati\u00f4nica utilizando uma resina Dowex 50WX8. Pr\u00e9-\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o das amostras foi obtida por evapora\u00e7\u00e3o a 90\u00b0C, sem perda ou \nfraccionamento isot\u00f3pico de Br.  \n\nDiscrimina\u00e7\u00e3o de massas foi corrigida por corre\u00e7\u00e3o externa utilizando \nbracketing, embora Sr, Ge e Se foram testados como potenciais padr\u00f5es \ninternos. Os valores 81Br/ 79Br obtidos para os materiais de refer\u00eancia isot\u00f3picos \n(NaBr) NIST (material de referencia padr\u00e3o) SRM 977 e (\u00e1gua do mar) IRMM \nBCR-403 demonstraram estar de acordo com os valores da literatura. \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 7, a medida da raz\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica de Cl em \u00e1gua do mar por \nMC-ICP-MS atrav\u00e9s de nebuliza\u00e7\u00e3o pneum\u00e1tica tradicional foi realizada \nutilizando, i) alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o de massa (potencial de resolu\u00e7\u00e3o de 10.000) para \nresolver interfer\u00eancias espectrais, ii) 5 mmol L-1 NH4OH como solu\u00e7\u00e3o de \nlimpeza a fim de diminuir o efeito de mem\u00f3ria e iii) uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Cl de \n? 70 mg L-1.  \n\nA carga cati\u00f4nica da \u00e1gua do mar e de sais de cloreto (NaCl, KCl) foi \neficientemente removida sem afetar a composi\u00e7\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica original da Cl \natrav\u00e9s de cromatografia cati\u00f4nica utilizando resina de troca i\u00f4nica Dowex \n50WX8. O m\u00e9todo desenvolvido demonstrou alta exatid\u00e3o e precis\u00e3o, atestadas \npela medi\u00e7\u00e3o da raz\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica 37Cl/ 35Cl na amostra CRM NIST 975a (valor \nobtido de 0,319765 \u00b1 0,000022, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com um valor de refer\u00eancia de \n0,319768 \u00b1 0,000187 a uma precis\u00e3o de ~ 0,007%, desvio padr\u00e3o relativo, n = \n3). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, o valor  ?37Cl (baseado no padr\u00e3o de cloro em agua do \nmar, SMOC) foi determinado para cinco padr\u00f5es diferentes que variaram de -\n0,54 a + 0,89 \u2030. \n\nO Cap\u00edtulo 8 apresenta um estudo ambiental de Br e Cl  em gelo \nmarinho coletados durante a expedi\u00e7\u00e3o Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem \neXperiment 2012, em diferentes profundidades e locais. Todas as medi\u00e7\u00f5es de \nraz\u00e3o isot\u00f3picas de Br e Cl foram realizadas de acordo com os m\u00e9todos \napresentados no Cap\u00edtulo 6 e 7. \n\nA concentra\u00e7\u00e3o destes elementos variou de 700 para 31000 \u00b5g L -1 para \nBr e de 200 para 8000 mg L-1 para Cl, sendo que as menores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \nforam relacionados com o gelo coletado em maiores profundidades, estando a \ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Br e Cl provavelmente relacionadas a processos \nde dessaliniza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nOs valores de ?81Br e  ?37Cl  apresentaram rela\u00e7\u00e3o linear com a suas \nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es, sugerindo que o processo de dessaliniza\u00e7\u00e3o desempenha um \npapel no fraccionamento isot\u00f3pico no gelo do mar. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nDit werk presenteert nieuwe methodes voor de kwantitatieve bepaling \nvan halogenen door middel van inductief gekoppeld plasma massaspectrometrie \n(ICP-MS)  en voor de meting van isotopen verhoudingen gebruikmakend van \nmulticollector (MC) ICP-MS.   \n\n  Vier methodes voor directe vastestofanalyse (SS) door middel van \nICP-MS \u2013 drie met behulp van elektrothermische vervluchtiging (ETV) en \u00e9\u00e9n \nmiddels laser ablatie (LA) \u2013 en twee methodes voor de isotopenanalyse van Br \nen Cl in zeewater met MC-ICP-MS werden ontwikkeld. Deze methodes werden \ntoegepast op stalen afkomstig uit concrete studies en geven als dusdanig \nrelevante resultaten met betrekking tot milieuprocessen. In alle methodes \nwaarin SS-ETV-ICP-MS toegepast werd, werden de vaste stalen direct \nafgewogen in grafietbuisjes en ingebracht in de grafietoven. De instrumentele \nparameters werden geoptimaliseerd voor het bekomen van een hoge \ngevoeligheid en effici\u00ebnte verwijdering van de matrix. Chloorbepaling in \nbiologische stalen kon uitgevoerd worden via kalibratie tegenover waterige \nstandaardoplossingen, in de aanwezigheid van vooraf gedroogde modifiers (Pd \n+ Nd of Pd + Ca) of met gecertificeerde vaste referentiematerialen (CRMs), \neveneens in de aanwezigheid van vooraf gedroogde modifiers of zonder \ngebruik te maken van modifiers, wat leidt tot een kwantificatielimiet (LOQ) \nvan 5 \u00b5g g-1. Voor de bepaling van Br en Cl in steenkoolstalen werd Cl accuraat \ngemeten middels kalibratie met vaste standaarden, terwijl Br ook succesvol \nwerd gekwantificeerd via kalibratie met waterige standaardoplossingen, in \nbeide gevallen met vooraf gedroogde modifiers (Pd + Ca). \nKwantificatielimieten van 0.03 \u00b5g g-1 en 7 \u00b5g g-1 werden bereikt voor \nrespectievelijk Br en Cl. In een derde deel van dit werk werden F, Cl, Br en I \nbepaald in fijn stof (PM10). Fluor werd bepaald middels hoge resolutie \nmoleculaire absorbtiespectrometrie (HR-CS MAS), waarbij de CaF molecule \ngeobserveerd werd, terwijl Cl, Br en I bepaald werd door middel van SS-ETV-\nICP-MS. De methode liet de kwantificatie van halogenen toe in 14 PM10-stalen \nverzameld in een noordoostelijke kuststad in Brazili\u00eb. De resultaten toonden \nvariaties in halogeengehalte naargelang de meteorologische omstandigheden, in \nhet bijzonder gerelateerd aan regenval, relatieve luchtvochtigheid en \nzonneschijn. In een vierde deel wordt de bepaling van broom in polymeerstalen \nmet LA-ICP-MS behandeld. Onder geoptimaliseerde omstandigheden kon Br \naccuraat bepaald worden in vijf verschillende polymeerstandaarden (CRM) en \nvijf \u2018echte\u2019 polymeerstalen door externe calibratie tegenover verschillende \nCRMs en eveneens door externe calibratie tegenover slechts \u00e9\u00e9n CRM, mits \ngebruik van het 12C+ als interne standaard. De LOQ werd bepaald op 110 \u00b5g g-1 \nBr.  \n\nDaarnaast werd aangetoond dat de accurate en precieze meting van \nbroom- en chloorisotopen verhoudingen in zeewater via MC-ICP-MS mogelijk \nis mits het gebruik van hoge massaresolutie, en door toevoeging van 5 mmol L-\n1 NH4OH aan alle staal-, standaard- en wasoplossingen (voor \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nanalietconcentraties van ? 3 mg L-1 voor Br en ? 70 mg L-1 voor Cl). Het \novergrote deel van de kationen in zeewater werd voorafgaand aan de analyse \nverwijderd door kationenuitwisselingschromatografie (Dowex 50WX8 hars). In \nhet geval van Br liet het uitdampen van de stalen bij 90\u00b0C toe om de stalen op \nte concentreren zonder analietverlies of isotopische fractionatie. Voor beide \nelementen werd gecorrigeerd voor massadiscriminatie door externe correctie in \neen staal-standaard \u2018bracketing\u2019 benadering, en tevens werd ook nagegaan of \nSr, Ge of Se kunnen aangewend worden als potenti\u00eble interne standaarden voor \nBr-isotopenanalyse. Vergelijking van de bekomen resultaten bij de analyse van \nCRMs met de referentiewaarden of waarden uit de literatuur, toonde aan dat \nbeide methodes aanleiding geven tot precieze en accurate resultaten. Tot slot \nwerden deze methodes toegepast als onderdeel van een milieustudie rond de \naanwezigheid van Br en Cl in zeeijs verzameld op verschillende dieptes en \nlocaties tijdens de Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment 2012 expeditie. \nDe concentratie van deze elementen in de stalen bedroeg 700 tot 31000 \u00b5 g L-1 \nBr en 200 tot 8000 mg L-1 Cl en er werd een relatie aangetoond tussen de Br en \nCl concentraties in de stalen en de overeenkomstige ?81Br en ?37Cl waarden. De \nlagere concentraties en ?-waarden werden geobserveerd in diep zeeijs, wat \nwaarschijnlijk verklaard kan worden door de optredende ontzoutingsprocessen.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n This work presents new approaches for halogen determination in a \nvariety of samples using inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-\nMS) and for isotope ratio measurements by multicollector \u2013 inductively \ncoupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) and application of the \nmethods developed to real environmental cases. Four methods for solid \nsampling (SS) analysis by ICP-MS, three using electrothermal vaporization - \ninductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (ETV-ICP-MS) and one using \nlaser ablation - inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), \nand two methods for isotopic analysis by MC-ICP-MS, one for Br and another \nfor Cl in sea water, were developed. The methods were applied for studying \nsamples from real study cases, providing significant results with respect to \nenvironmental processes.  For all three methods using SS-ETV-ICP-MS, the \nsolid samples were directly weighed into graphite \u2018cups\u2019 that were subsequently \ninserted into the graphite furnace, and the instrumental parameters were \noptimized for high sensitivity and efficient matrix removal. Chlorine \ndetermination in biological samples could be carried out using aqueous \nstandard solutions, when using pre-dried modifiers (Pd + Nd or Pd + Ca) or \nusing solid certified reference material (CRM), accompanied with or without \nthe same pre-dried, achieving a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5 \u00b5g g-1. For \nBr and Cl determination in coal samples, Cl was accurately determined using \ncalibration against solid standards, whereas Br could also be quantified \nadequately by using calibration against aqueous standard solutions, both using \npre-dried modifiers (Pd + Ca), LOQs of 0.03 \u00b5g g-1 for Br and 7 \u00b5g g-1 for Cl \nwere achieved. F, Cl, Br and I were determined in particulate matter, F was \ndetermined via high resolution \u2013 continuum source molecular absorption \nspectrometry (HR-CS MAS) for monitoring the CaF molecule, while Cl, Br and \nI were determined via SS-ETV-ICP-MS. This method allowed the \nquantification of the halogens in 14 PM10 samples collected in a Northeastern \ncoastal city in Brazil. The results demonstrated variations of the halogen \ncontents according to meteorological conditions, particularly related to rainfall, \nhumidity and sunlight irradiation. Bromine determination in polymer samples \nwas accomplished via LA-ICP-MS after the optimization of the operational \nparameters for high sensitivity. Under optimized conditions, it was possible to \naccurately determine Br in 5 different certified polymer reference materials and \n5 real polymer samples by external calibration using different certified \nmaterials containing different concentrations of Br and by external calibration \nagainst a single certified material monitoring 12C+ as internal standard. The \nLOQ obtained was 110 \u00b5g g-1 of Br. Bromine and Cl isotopic analysis in \nseawater via MC-ICP-MS was proven feasible, operated in high mass \nresolution and by decreasing the memory effect using 5 mmol L-1 of NH4OH in \nsample, standard and wash solutions. Optimal analyte concentrations were ? 3 \nmg L-1 for Br and ? 70 mg L-1 for Cl. The major cation load of seawater was \nremoved via cation exchange chromatography (Dowex 50WX8 resin). In the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\ncase of Br, evaporation of the samples at 90\u00b0C permitted analyte \npreconcentration without Br loss or isotope fractionation. Mass discrimination \nwas corrected for by external correction in a sample-standard bracketing \napproach for both elements. Sr, Ge and Se were also tested as potential internal \nstandards for Br isotopic analysis but provided no advantage. Both methods \ndemonstrated high precision and accuracy based on the comparison of \nexperimental values with certified and literature values. The methods were \napplied within the context of an environmental study of Br and Cl in sea ice \ncollected during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment 2012 voyage at \ndifferent depths and locations. The concentration of these elements in the \nsamples ranged from 700 to 31000 \u00b5g L-1 for Br and from 200 mg L-1 to 8000 \nmg L-1 for Cl, and a relation between the concentrations and the corresponding \n?81Br and ?37Cl values was found. Lower concentrations and  ? values were \nobserved for sea ice collected at greater depths and are probably related to \ndesalinization processes.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAcronyms  \n \nCRM - Certified Reference Material \nETV - Electrothermal Vaporization \nETV-ICP-MS - Electrothermal Vaporization - Inductively Coupled Plasma - \nMass Spectrometry \nGF - Graphite Furnace \nHR-CS MAS - High-Resolution Continuum Source Molecular Absorption \nSpectrometry \nIC - Ion Chromatography  \nICP - Inductively Coupled Plasma \nICP-MS - Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry \nID - Isotope Dilution \nIRMS - Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry   \nLA-ICP-MS - Laser Ablation - Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass \nSpectrometry \nLOD \u2013 Limit of Detection \nLOQ \u2013 Limit of Quantification \nMC-ICP-MS - Multicollector - Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass \nSpectrometry \nMIC \u2013 Microwave - Induced Combustion \nNCIMS - Negative Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry \nNIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology \nPC - Principal Component \nPFA - Perfluoroalkoxy Alkane \nPM10 \u2013 Particulate Matter ? 10\u00b5m \nPN - Pneumatic Nebulizer \nPN-MC-ICP-MS \u2013 Pneumatic Nebulization - Multicollector - Inductively \nCoupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry \nPTIMS - Positive Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry \nPVSA - Peak Volume Selected Absorbance \nRF \u2013 Radio Frequency \nRSD \u2013 Relative Standard Deviation \nSIPEX-2 - Australian-led Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment-2 \nSMOB - Standard Mean Ocean Bromide \nSRM \u2013 Standard Reference Material \nSSB - Sample-Standard Bracketing Approach  \nSS-ETV-ICP-MS \u2013 Solid Sample - Electrothermal Vaporization - Inductively \nCoupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry \nTIMS - Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry \nTp - Pyrolysis Temperature \nTv - Vaporization Temperature \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nContents \nIntroduction 1 \n1.

Specially, the sample pretreatment can be a challenging issue \nfor halogen determination and must be carefully carried out in order not \nto promote analyte loss or contamination. \n\n In this sense, the use of Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass \nSpectrometry (ICP-MS) is an attractive alternative for halogen \ndetermination, presenting high sensitivity, multielement capabilities, \nwide linear dynamic range and can be coupled to solid sample \ntechniques. Moreover, it can be used for isotope ratio measurements \nwith high precision. \n\nThus, the aim of this work was to develop straightforward \nmethods for halogen determination by solid sample \u2013 electrothermal \nvaporization - inductively coupled plasma-Mass Spectrometry (SS-\nETV-ICP-MS) and laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass \nspectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and for halogen isotope measurements by \nmulticollector - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (MC-\nICP-MS), applying the developed methods for studying samples \nobtained from real life cases. \n\nThis work is divided to eight chapters, consisting of a revision \nof the literature in Chapter 1; the development of methods for halogen \ndetermination by solid sample analysis using ICP-MS and a case study \nin the Chapters 2, 3 and 4; the development of a straightforward method \nfor Br determination in polymer samples via LA-ICP-MS in Chapter 5; \nand the development of methods for halogen isotope ratio measurements \nand a case study in Chapters 6, 7 and 8.    -------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------                                                                           \n\n\n\n?\n\n?\n\n        \n\n  \n\n\n\n?\n\n?\n\nChapter 1 - Halogens:  From a brief look at their \n\nimportance to their determination by inductively coupled plasma - \n\nmass spectrometry \n\n\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n5 \n\n?\n\n1.1. Introduction \n\nThe halogens are a group of elements which present distinct \napplications, physiological functions, properties and toxicological \nimportance [1-2]. They are released into the environment either by \nhuman activities or natural processes, hence their monitoring is \nimportant in order to assess, among others, contamination, impacted \nareas, environmental reactions and biological mechanisms [1-2]. \n\nThe monitoring of halogens in environmental and biological \nsystems is still a challenging task due to analytical issues, which range \nfrom the sample preparation to the instrumental detection by the selected \ntechnique [3-4]. \n\nIn order to avoid analyte loss or contamination, the sample \npretreatment must be wisely selected and carefully carried out. A few \napproaches may be used, such as pyrohydrolysis, combustion bomb, \noxygen flask, microwave - induced combustion (MIC) or even \nextraction procedures. In this sense, direct solid sample analysis is a \nvery attractive alternative since no sample pretreatment is required, thus \navoiding the risk of contamination and/or analyte loss [4]. \n\nAmong the available techniques for halogen analysis, ICP-MS \nhas demonstrated to be attractive due to its multielement capabilities, \nhigh sensitivity and wide linear range for calibration, in addition to the \npossibility to carry out high precision isotope ratios measurements, \nmainly using MC-ICP-MS [5]. \n\nThus, the aim of this chapter is to introduce the concepts \nassociated to halogen analysis, from sample pretreatment to the \ninstrumental analysis by ICP-MS, addressing part of the discussion on \nprinciples and basic concepts of the techniques.   \n\n1.2. Halogens \n\nHalogens are reactive elements from group 17 of the periodic \ntable, which present different physical properties among them. These \ndifferences lead to distinct reactions and applications [1-6]. \n\nIn nature, the halogens can be found in several natural \nreservoirs as halides combined with other elements [1-2, 6]. The \ndistribution of halogens in nature is not entirely known, firstly because, \nin some cases, they are present at very low concentrations, hindering \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n6 \n\n?\n\ntheir monitoring using the available traditional techniques [6,7-9], and \nsecondly, due to their dynamic characteristics regarding environmental \nprocesses such as volcanic eruptions, movement of wind and sea, and \nenvironmental reactions, as for example bromine explosion events \n(which is a photocatalytic reaction that converts halides salts into \nreactive halogens which are released to the environment) [6,10].  \n\nIndustrially, the halogens are employed for several purposes, \nincluding water treatment [11], as polymers additives and in paper \nmanufacturing [12] and oral hygiene products [13]. Despite their wide \napplicability, a few problems are generally related to their presence in \nthe environment, such as the ability to destroy O3 [14] molecules. \nTherefore, the halogens are regarded as powerful disrupting agents of \nthe ozone layer [7, 15-17]. \n\nThe halogens can be released to the atmosphere by \nanthropogenic processes as well as by natural processes, such as \nvolcanic eruptions and evaporation from the ocean. The majority of the \norganic gases containing halogens is man-made and may remain in the \natmosphere for up to 100 years [9-10]. \n\nIn biological systems, the halogens can be found either as halide \nions or as part of organic molecules, which include proteins, and present \ndifferent properties [18-19]. An example is the capture of iodine by the \nthyroids acting on the hormonal adjustment [20], and the decrease in the \nincidence of teeth cavities by the use of fluorine. Chlorine helps \nregulating the osmotic pressure in extracellular fluids and is also present \nin saliva and digestive fluids in the stomach [10].\n\nThe properties of the halogens and halogenated compounds \ncalled the attention of the pharmaceutical industry, and several studies \nhave been carried out applying halogens or compounds containing \nhalogens as medicinal drugs to help the treatment of serious diseases, \nsuch as cancer [21] or diseases with a lower death incidence, such as \nthose related to the central nervous system [22]. \n\nDespite the potential benefits associated to the diverse uses of \nhalogens, several toxic effects are related to their presence which are \nmore intensified at high concentrations, in some cases the toxic effects \nof the halogens at high concentrations resemble those attributed to \nelements such as As and Hg [23]. \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n7 \n\n?\n\n1.3. Halogen determination \n\n1.3.1. Sample pretreatment  \n\nThe sample pretreatment required for halogen determination by \nmeans of ICP-MS is a critical step since most procedures adopted to \ndecompose solid samples are based on the use of inorganic acids, which \npromote the volatilization of the halogens as hydrogen halides. In \naddition, contamination and interferences arising from the reagents used \nfor sample preparation are also important issues to be considered [24]. \nThus, methods that do not require the use of inorganic acids during the \nsample pretreatment may be successfully employed; these include \npyrohydrolysis [25], microwave-induced combustion (MIC), \ncombustion based procedures and alkaline treatment. [26]. Moreover, \nthe sample handling in order to reduce the particle\u2019s size prior the \nsample pretreatment is an important issue for halogen determination, \nmethods which avoid the heating of the sample by physical processes \nmay be preferred in order to avoid analyte volatilization. \n\nPyrohydrolysis was first used for industrial processes and it was \napplied as a sample pretreatment process for analytical purposes for the \nfirst time in 1954 [25], and since then it has been successfully used for \nsample preparation associated to the determination of volatile analytes in \nseveral sorts of samples. The basic principle of pyrohydrolysis is the \nheating of the sample, which leads to volatilization of the analytes that \nare carried to and retained in a solution that shows affinity for the \nanalytes [4]. \n\nFigure 1 presents the simplified scheme of a pyrohydrolysis \ndevice, in which the sample is heated in a sample holder (Figure 1D) \npositioned into a quartz tube (Figure 1C) volatilizing the analyte, while \nwater is inserted through a tube using a peristaltic pump in order to \nproduce water vapor. The water vapor is carried by a gas flow inserted \nby a tube (Figure 1A) that also carries the analytes to the condenser. The \nwater vapor containing the volatized compounds from the sample is \ncondensed and retained into the absorbing solution [28]. Heating is \nnormally provided by a furnace (Figure 1B), which is normally based on \nelectrothermal heating with a temperature control.\n\nPyrohydrolysis devices have been successfully applied for \nsample pretreatment prior to the determination of volatile elements in \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n8 \n\n?\n\ndifferent matrices such as coal, geological samples [29-30], biological \nsamples [31] and even carbon nanotubes [28]. \n\nFigure 1.

Closed \nsystems will be focused in this chapter due to the goal of decreasing the \npossibility of analyte loss by volatilization and therefore, is feasible to \nbe applied for halogen determination. \n\nClosed combustion systems may avoid loss of the analyte due \nto the retention of the combustion products into the vessels, with \nsubsequent absorption of the analytes in an absorbing solution [32]. \nThese systems comprise the combustion bomb, the oxygen flask and, the \nmore recently developed technique for combustion, the MIC. \n\nThe combustion bomb is normally used for organic matrices \nwith the advantage of simplicity and ability to decompose the samples in \nonly a few minutes (normally less than 30 min including cooling step).  \nIn the combustion bomb, the sample (at least 0.5 mg) is combusted \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n9 \n\n?\n\ninside of a vessel made of stainless steel that is pressurized with oxygen. \nThe products generated by the combustion of the sample are absorbed \ninto a suitable solution located into the stainless steel bomb [4]. \n\nFigure 2.

An aliquot of about 5 to 10 \nmL of the absorbing solution is inserted onto the bottom of the vessel in \norder to trap the products of the combustion reaction. Oxygen is used to \npressurize the system from 20 to 30 atm [4]. \n\nDue to the high temperature generated from the combustion, it \nis necessary to cool down the system before removing the resulting \nsolution, a step that usually requires water or an ice bath can be \nemployed for this purpose [4].  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n10 \n\n?\n\nThe combustion bomb may be employed for combustible \nsamples, although combusting reagent may be employed in order to \nextend the use of the combustion bomb for samples which are not easily \ncombusted [4].  \n\nThe drawbacks associated to combustion bombs include the \npossibility of contamination with metals from the metallic parts of the \ndevice, the processing of one sample per time, reducing the sample \nthroughput, and the need for an adequate absorbing solution, considering \nthe analyte [4].  \n\nAnother combustion system that can be applied is the oxygen \nflask (Figure 3), also known as Sch\u00f6niger flask or Sch\u00f6niger system. \nThe flask is a simple combustion system composed of a glass vessel \ncontaining oxygen at atmospheric pressure and an absorbing solution \nwhich is inserted at the bottom of the vessel [4, 33]. \n\nFigure 3.

The ignition of the \nsample is initiated by an electrical current applied to the Pt wire or by a \nfocused infrared lamp; another option is the use of a piece of paper \nwhich is usually ignited before the introduction of the Pt holder into the \nvessel [33].  \n\nUnlike the combustion bomb, there is a limitation of sample \nmass that can be used (which is considerably lower than that for the \ncombustion bomb), which means that analysis of samples containing \ntrace levels of the analyte may be compromised. Moreover, the system \nrequires constant monitoring during the sample pretreatment and \ncontamination from the materials used for the combustion may be \nexpected [33] \n\nMore recently, MIC has been introduced as a sample \npretreatment technique that can be applied for to a wide range of \nanalytes and matrices including, for example, soil and carbon nanotubes \n(which were successfully combusted by this technique after proper \noptimization of the operating parameters) [4, 32]. In MIC, an aliquot of \nthe sample is combusted inside of a quartz vessel pressurized with \noxygen; the ignition is started by microwave irradiation. Similarly to \nother combustion techniques, in MIC the gases resulting from the \ncombustion are absorbed in a solution, although in MIC the absorbing \nsolution is subject to reflux [32]. \n\nThe MIC system (Figure 4) is basically a combination of a \ncommercially available microwave oven for wet sample digestion and \nthe combustion techniques. The samples are prepared as pellets and \npositioned on top of a small piece of low-ash filter paper in a quartz \nholder. An ammonium nitrate solution is added as an igniter and the \nsystem is then closed, pressurized with oxygen to 15 to 25 atm and then \nthe microwave radiation (maximum power of 1400 W) is applied to start \nthe combustion [4, 32].  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n12 \n\n?\n\nFigure 4.

Thus, rupture disks are used in the cap to release the pressure \nof the system in case of \u2018violent\u2019 reactions. The quartz vessels are the \nsame as those used for conventional digestion procedures using a \nmicrowave oven. Contamination is reduced by the use of quartz instead \nof stainless steel, which is normally used in the combustion bomb [4, \n32].  \n\nTemperatures of about 1300 oC are reached during the \ncombustion of the sample (this temperature is also reached using a \ncombustion bomb), which is suitable for most applications [4]. \n\nThe absorbing solution is added at the bottom of the vessel in \norder to absorb the products generated from the combustion. After the \nsystem is cooled down the solution can be removed, diluted and \nanalyzed [4,32].  \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n13 \n\n?\n\nOpposite to the combustion techniques where the total \ndegradation of the sample is aimed at, extraction procedures or even \npartial degradation of the samples have also demonstrated to be \napplicable in the context of halogen determination, with the advantage \nof simplicity and low cost when compared to the combustion techniques \n[4].  \n\nSample pretreatment in alkaline media employing, for example, \ntetramethylammonium hydroxide and heating, or even diluted acids \nconcomitantly with ultra-sound energy have gained interest and, in \nseveral cases, provided results that were comparable to those obtained \nusing combustion techniques [31, 34]. \n\nThe use of alkaline media has been successfully applied for \nsample pretreatment of botanical and biological samples for posterior \nhalogen determination [35-36]. In this method, TMAH and heating were \nemployed, promoting the partial decomposition and partial or complete \nsolubilization of the sample, allowing analysis by ICP-MS after proper \nselection of the sample introduction system [37]. \n\nThe employment of alkaline media sample pretreatment for \nhalogen determination presents the advantage of avoiding the formation \nof volatile halogen compounds, such as HCl, which are easily formed in \nacidic media [37]. The procedure is also simple and fast, allowing high \nsample throughput and reducing the risk of contamination.  \n\nAnalyte extraction may replace sample decomposition in \nseveral applications. Ultrasound energy and diluted acids are normally \nemployed in order to extract the analytes from the matrix, resulting in \nmethods that are simple and associated to high sample throughput [38]. \nHowever, the use of diluted acids may lead to the formation of volatile \nforms of halogens. \n\nA very attractive alternative for halogen determination, that \ndoes not involve laborious sample pretreatment, is the use of direct solid \nsample analysis, which will be further described.  \n\n1.3.2. Direct solid sample analysis  \n\nAlthough sample pretreatment procedures are considered well-\nestablished and accepted, solid and slurry sample analysis present \nadvantages over procedures based on wet sample pretreatment [39]. The \nassociated benefits are summarized below: \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n14 \n\n?\n\n1. decreased risk of contamination, since the amount of \nreagents used is reduced or eliminated and the sample \nhandling is significantly reduced; \n\n2. increased detection capability, since the sample is not \ndiluted; \n\n3. reduced risk of analyte loss; \n4. increased sample throughput; \n5. reduced need for special apparatus for sample \n\npretreatment;  \n6. contributes to the environment, since little or no toxic \n\nor corrosive reagents are required; \n7. allows the study of microhomogeneity. \n\nSolid sample analysis may be accomplished by using the \nsample as a powder or in situ; a few techniques may require some \nsample pretreatment in order to produce pellets or another form that is \nsuitable for introduction into the instrument [39].\n\nIt is clear that direct solid sample analysis presents several \nadvantages over the traditional sample pretreatment procedures by the \nsimple fact that no sample pretreatment is required, although direct solid \nsample analysis normally requires more from the quantification \ntechnique than an analysis carried out after the sample pretreatment, as \nthe matrix of the sample is not destroyed. \n\nIn general, interferences are expected to increase when using \nsolid sampling analysis, including those that would not be present while \nanalyzing a digested sample, due to the presence of relatively large \nquantities of the matrix [39]. Other difficulties that have limited the \napplication of solid sample analysis are based on the fact that only a few \ninstrumental techniques are powerful enough to analyze liquid and solid \nsamples, and normally for those techniques, special apparatus for solid \nsample analysis are required, and problems with sample homogeneity \nare intensified at low masses. \n\nMatrix components are responsible for spectral interferences \n(which will be discussed further) and non-spectral interferences; hence, \nthe analytical technique must be able to avoid or deal with possible \ninterferences. The extent of the effect that may be exerted by the sample \nmatrix is a function of the sample mass introduced in the equipment.  \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n15 \n\n?\n\nThe use of micro amounts of sample is normally preferred; however, a \ncompromise must be considered in order to reduce the effect of \nheterogeneity of the sample. Typical precision values are expected to be \nup to 15% of relative standard deviation (RSD), which are considered \nacceptable for direct solid sample analysis [39-40]. \n\nIdeally, the behavior of the analyte in the samples should be the \nsame as the behavior of the analyte in the standards. However, this \nstatement is, sometimes, difficult to achieve using solid sample analysis \nwhen aqueous standards are used for calibration, since the chemical \nform of the analyte in the solid sample normally differs significantly \nfrom the chemical form of the analyte in aqueous standards [39]. On \noccasions, calibration has to be carried out against a solid sample, such \nas a certified reference material (CRM) [40]. \n\nDifferent approaches can be performed in order to achieve \naccurate results, such as the use of different calibrations approaches and \nequipments that allow for the destruction of the matrix of the sample in \nsitu as SS-ETV-ICP-MS. \n\nOther effects that can be expected from the analysis of solid \nsamples are difficulties associated to non-homogeneous distribution of \nthe analyte, since the amount of sample is considerably reduced [40]. \n\n1.3.3. Instrumental analysis \n\nThe choice of the technique for halogen determination is also \nconsidered critical due to the limited number of options that are suitable \nfor this task, particularly when the analytes are expected to be present at \ntrace levels [4, 28].  \n\nThe quantification of halogens may be carried out by different \ntechniques, including ion chromatography (IC) [41] and ion-selective \nelectrodes [42]. Both techniques require the analyte to be in aqueous \nmedium and in ionic form, which implies the fact that sample \npretreatment is required in order to solubilize the analytes properly.  In \norder to avoid the sample pretreatment step, halogens quantification in \nsolid samples may be performed by techniques such as instrumental \nneutron activation analysis [43], X-ray fluorescence spectrometry [44] \nand laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy [45].  \n\nA few disadvantages are frequently related to these techniques, \nincluding low sensitivity, low sample throughput, limitations for multi \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n16 \n\n?\n\nelement analysis, incidence of interferences and short linear range for \nquantification.  \n\nIn order to fill the gap associated to alternatives for halogen \ndetermination, techniques such as high resolution continuum source \nmolecular absorption spectrometry (HR-CS MAS) [46] and ICP-MS \n[27, 28] were recently proposed for halogen determination, offering high \nsensitivity, high sample throughput, and, in the case of ICP-MS, multi \nelement character and a wide linear range for quantification. \nNevertheless, there are only a few examples of the application of these \ntechniques for halogen determination in the literature. \n\nIsotope ratio measurements of halogens, which is normally \nlimited to Br and Cl, are even more complex to be performed, and the \namount of techniques that can be applied for this purpose is very limited.  \n\n These techniques include isotope ratio mass spectrometry \n(IRMS) [48], negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry (NCIMS) \n[49], thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) [50, 51] and one \napplication example using HR-CS MAS [52]. Unfortunately, these \ntechniques are characterized by a number of drawbacks, such as the \nneed for time-consuming sample preparation procedures, the occurrence \nof memory effect and/or poor precision. \n\nPositive thermal ionization mass spectrometry (PTIMS), \nrelying on the monitoring of the polyatomic Cs2Cl\n\n+, has been applied \nto the measurement of Cl isotope ratio in different standards and \nwater samples. However, it was demonstrated that the technique \nsuffers from mass fractionation depending on the Cl concentration \n[53].\n\nIn the case of this work, MC-ICP-MS, which is a powerful \ntechnique for high-precision isotopic analysis, was used. However, \napplication of MC-ICP-MS for halogen isotope ratio measurements \nis limited to a few examples in the literature, typically using sample \nintroduction systems that allow the insertion of a \u201cdry\u201d vapor into the \nplasma [54, 55]. \n\n1.4. Short overview about ICP-MS \n\nICP-MS is a powerful analytical technique with the ability to \nperform multi-element analysis at trace levels and in a large variety of \nsample types [56]. \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n17 \n\n?\n\nThe basic principle of ICP-MS is the detection of analytes \nwhich are separated based on their mass charge ratio (m/z) following \nionization in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) [5].  \n\nA typical analytical routine in ICP-MS begins with aspiration of \nthe sample and aerosol formation that takes place in the sample \nintroduction system. A conventional sample introduction system for \nICP-MS is composed of a nebulizer and a spray chamber, which are \ncommercially available with different geometries [5, 56-57]. \n\nThe nebulizers typically used in ICP-MS are classified as \npneumatic (PN) and ultrasonic nebulizers. In PN, the aerosol is formed \nowing to the interaction between the liquid sample flow and a an Argon \ngas flow at high speed, while in ultrasonic nebulization the aerosol of \nthe sample is formed as a result of contact of the liquid sample to an \nultrasonic transducer, the sample introduction efficiency for these \nnebulizers can range from about 2 to 20% [5, 56-58]. \n\nImmediately after formation, the aerosol droplet diameters are \nheterogeneously distributed, which often results in the formation of a \ndense aerosol. In order to reduce the diameter and homogenize the \ndroplets that reach the ICP, the nebulizer is connected to a spray \nchamber, which allows only small droplets to reach the plasma, hence \nfacilitating the desolvation step that takes place immediately afterwards \nin the plasma [5, 56]. As a consequence, the steps of dissociation and \nionization are also benefited, and the deleterious effects that derive from \nthe addition of water droplets in the plasma are minimized. Typical \nspray chamber designs include the Scott type (or double pass) and \ncyclonic type and, in some cases, a combination of the Scott type with a \ncyclonic spray chamber [57]. \n\nOnce the aerosol has passed the spray chamber, the droplets are \ncarried to the central channel of the plasma, where the processes of \ndesolvation, volatilization, atomization and ionization take place [5, 57]. \nArgon plasmas are typically used in ICP-MS instruments. The plasma is \ninitially formed by an electrical discharge and is maintained by the \nenergy coupled to it by a radio frequency (RF) generator. The \ntemperature in the plasma may be as high as 10,000 K in the induction \nzone and from 5,000 to 7,000 K in the central channel of plasma due to \nthe insertion of the cold aerosol of the sample [5]. \n\nThe ions formed in the ICP are extracted to a region of high \nvacuum after passing through a region of intermediate vacuum that \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n18 \n\n?\n\nnormally contains two cones, a sampler and a skimmer cone. The ions \nare extracted from the interface and guided to the mass spectrometer by \nan ion optic system, which also stops particles, neutral species and \nphotons from entering the mass analyser and the detector [59]. \n\n The most common mass analyzer is the quadrupole due to its \nlow cost and simplicity when compared to other commercially available \nmass analyzer [5, 57]. The main drawback associated to quadrupole \nmass analyzers is the low mass resolution (about 300u) and its non-\nsimultaneous detection of different isotopes. Mass analyzers based on \nthe combination of magnetic and electric sectors (double focusing) are \nbetter suited when a higher mass resolution is required to separate the \nanalyte ions from interfering ions. In these mass analyzers, the ions are \nspatially separated according to their m/z ratio [60] and might be \nsimultaneously detected if more than one detector is available in the \nequipment. \n\nOnce the ions are selected by the mass analyzer, they reach the \ndetector and generate an electrical signal that will be further processed. \nElectron multipliers are the detectors normally employed in single \ncollector instruments, whereas Faraday cups are preferred for MC-ICP-\nMS [60-61]. \n\nAnalysis using ICP-MS may be hindered by interferences. \nSpectral interferences, such as those originating from the formation of \npolyatomic ions in the plasma environment, are fairly common and \nrequire special instrumentation or operating conditions to be eliminated. \nThese include the use of a collision and/or reaction cell in quadrupole-\nbased instruments, mathematical equations based on the signal measured \nat alternative m/z ratios, changes in the plasma conditions and use of \nhigh-resolution mass spectrometers.   \n\nNon-spectral interferences, on the other hand, are somehow less \npredictable than spectral interferences. They lead to a suppression or \nenhancement of the analyte signal due to the effects in the processes of \naspiration and nebulization of the sample, ionization of the analyte and \ntransmission and detection of the ions [5, 62]. In general, non-spectral \ninterferences may be corrected for by the adoption of calibration \nstandards prepared in the same medium as the samples. Alternatives \nsuch as the use of standard addition calibration, internal standards or \nisotope dilution (ID) calibration [5] may be advantageously used.  \n\n   \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n19 \n\n?\n\n1.4.1. Isotope ratio measurements by MC-ICP-MS \n\nThe ability of obtaining isotopic information makes ICP-MS an \nattractive technique to perform isotope ratio analysis. In this approach, \ntwo or more isotopes of a given element are measured in order to \nprovide information on induced or natural changes in one or more \nisotopes ratio. Isotope ratio measurements may, e.g. be employed to \ndetermine the age of geological materials, to assist in understanding \nenvironmental and biological reaction mechanisms and to identify \ncontamination sources. [60, 63].  \n\nUnfortunately, the application range of isotope ratio analysis \nusing quadrupole ICP-MS is limited by the relatively low precision, \nnormally higher than 0.1% RSD for \u201ctraditional\u201d quadrupole based ICP-\nMS and about 0.05% RSD for quadrupole based ICP-MS equipped with \ncollision/reaction cell due to the temporal homogenization of the ions \nbefore they reach the detector [63]. The main disadvantages of \nquadrupole based ICP-MS equipment for isotopic analysis are basically \nthe non-simultaneous isotope monitoring and the non-flat peak shape, in \naddition to other instrumental peculiarities that include low resolution \nand detector issues. \n\nIn this sense, the use of MC-ICP-MS it preferred due to (i) its \ncapability to measure different isotopes of the same element \nsimultaneously, which implies that plasma instabilities will not affect \nthe measured isotope ratio; (ii) the occurrence of flat-shaped peaks, \navoiding variations in the measured signal due to small shifts in the \nposition of the signal maximum and (iii) special instrumental \npeculiarities that increase the stability of the measurements [60].  \n\nThe simultaneous monitoring of isotopes is of great importance \nfor isotope ratio measurements, since fluctuations in the signals are \nlikely to happen for both isotopes at the same time. This feature is \npossible due to the use of a double-focusing mass analyzer with Nier\u2013\nJohnson geometry, which simultaneously separates the isotopes in space \nwithin a given mass window, and multiple detectors positioned after the \nmass analyzer, each one monitoring a different isotope [61, 63].  \n\nAnother important characteristic of MC-ICP-MS is the flat-\nshaped peak, obtained by maintaining the width of the exit slit (collector \nslit) at a higher aperture than the entrance slit (source slit) [63]. A side \neffect from this approach is the \u201cdeterioration\u201d of the equipment\u2019s \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n20 \n\n?\n\nresolution. In this case, peaks that are usually separated using a single \ncollector high resolution ICP-MS instrument are often not completely \nseparated using MC-ICP-MS. Therefore, the instrument is said to \noperate in \u201cpseudo\u201d medium or high resolution. However, in most cases, \na mass window (shoulder) in the signal where the contribution of the \nsignal comes solely from the analyte is observed, which is sufficient to \ncarry out precise isotope ratio measurements [63]. \n\nIn addition to the basic instrumental requirements for high \nprecision isotope analysis by MC-ICP-MS, other effects, such as mass \ndiscrimination, matrix effects and interferences, need to be counteracted \nin order to allow accurate and precise results. Once the elements have \nbeen ionized in the ICP, the ions are extracted into the mass \nspectrometer and transmitted for posterior detection. Mass \ndiscrimination may occur during these steps, resulting in inaccurate \nresults regarding the true isotope ratio. Non-conventional sample \nintroduction systems, such as desolvator systems and vapor generation, \ncertain sample preparation processes and matrix effects may also induce \ndifferent degrees of mass discrimination [60]. \n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to correct for mass \ndiscrimination, although this is still a challenge and sometimes the \ncorrection presents some pitfalls. Common approaches adopted to \ncorrect for mass discrimination effect are discussed below. \n\nExternal correction using a standard with a well-known isotope \nratio may be useful. In this case, the standard-sample-standard \nbracketing approach is used, where the isotope ratio related to the \nsample is measured, and this measurement is preceded and followed by \nthe measurement of an isotopic standard with a known isotopic \ncomposition. In order to apply this method for correction, the \nconcentration of the analyte in the sample and standards must be as \nsimilar as possible, ideally not exceeding 30% of difference. However, \nthis theoretical limit may vary depending on the analyte, matrix \ncomposition, sample introduction system used and instrumental setup. \nSince the matrix may influence the magnitude of mass discrimination, it \nis advisable that both (sample and standards) present the same matrix \ncomposition, which can be achieved by the isolation of the analyte from \nthe sample [60, 63]. \n\nCorrection using an internal standard is also feasible. In this \napproach, a known concentration of an element (with a known isotopic \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n21 \n\n?\n\ncomposition and a similar mass to that of the element for which the \nisotope ratio will be measured) is added to the sample solution. The bias \nbetween the measured and the known isotope ratios of the standard is \nused to determine the mass discrimination factor per unit of mass, which \ncan be subsequently used to correct the isotope ratio of the analyte in the \nsample [60, 63]. \n\nAll elements show isotope fractionation in environmental or \nbiological processes, a few elements show isotope fractionation due to \nradiogenic decay, as for example, 87Sr which is a result from 87Rb decay. \nIn this case, the 88Sr/86Sr ratio does not suffer variation and may be used \nin order to correct for mass discrimination [60, 63] \u2013 a procedure known \nas \u2018internal correction\u2019. \n\nIn a brief look at the current literature, it is possible to find \ndifferent approaches that have been proposed for mass discrimination \ncorrection, demonstrating that there is still some discussion in order to \nfind the most suitable and accurate approach. As the mass fractionation \ndepends on different factors including the analyte and matrix, it is \npossible that the most suitable approach for correction varies from case \nto case. \n\nAfter correction, the isotope ratio is usually represented as the \nratio associated to the measured isotopes or relative to a standard or \nsample, termed as ? values, which is calculated according to Equation 1 \n[63]: \n\n????? ?\n??\t\n??\n????\t??\t??\n\n???\t??\t??\n?? ????     (Equation 1) \n\nIn Equation 1, Rsample refers to the isotope ratio of the element in \nthe sample and Rstandard is the isotope ratio of the element in the standard. \n\n1.4.2. Halogen determination by ICP-MS \n\nQuantitative determination of halogens by ICP-MS is usually \nnot a trivial task, mainly due to issues associated with sample \npretreatment, memory effect when using conventional sample \nintroduction systems, relatively low sensitivity (when compared to the \ntypical ICP-MS sensitivity for other elements of the periodic table) and \nthe presence of spectral interferences [64].  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n22 \n\n?\n\nMemory effect is a critical issue for halogen determination by \nICP-MS, especially when acidic solutions are used [65], which is likely \ndue to the formation of volatile species, such as HX (X=Cl, Br and I). In \norder to reduce the memory effect, a few strategies may be adopted, \nincluding the use of alternative sample introduction systems and specific \nwashout solutions that should be employed between successive \nmeasurements cycles [36].    \n\nThe relatively low sensitivity associated to halogen \ndetermination by ICP-MS results from their high ionization energy \n(17.42 eV for F, 12.97 eV for Cl, 11.81 eV for Br and 10.45 eV for I), \nand hence, low ionization efficiencies (in the order of 30, 5 and 0.9% for \nI, Br and Cl, respectively). Fluorine is the most critical halogen to be \nanalyzed by ICP-MS, since negligible populations of F+ are formed in \nAr plasma. Quantification of F by ICP-MS may be accomplished using a \nHe plasma [47] or using a non-conventional approach monitoring \nnegative ions by ICP-MS [66], but reports on F analyse by means of \nICP-MS are scarce. \n\nSpectral interferences associated to halogens quantification by \nICP-MS are due to the formation of polyatomic ions, which include \n16O18O1H+ and 34S1H+ overlapping with the m/z of 35Cl+; 36Ar1H+ and \n36S1H+, overlapping with the m/z of 37Cl+; 40Ar39K+, 31P16O3\n\n+ and \n38Ar40Ar1H+ overlapping with the m/z of 79Br+ and 32S16O3\n\n1H+, \n40Ar40Ar1H+ and 33S16O3\n\n+ overlapping with the m/z of 81Br+ also \njeopardizes the determination of halogens by ICP-MS, mainly in low \nresolution mode. The impact of these polyatomic ion interferences \ndepend on the sample introduction system and on the sample matrix, \nsince K, P and S are easily found at relatively high concentrations in \nseveral matrices, Ar is the plasma gas and O and H come from water and \nother reagents used for sample preparation. \n\nAn alternative to avoid the undesired effects associated to \nhalogen determination by ICP-MS include the use of direct solid sample \nanalysis with devices such as laser ablation (LA-ICP-MS). However, \nproblems regarding calibration strategy for quantification, isotope \nfractionation for isotopic analysis, and instrumental cost are still \nsignificant [60, 69]. \n\nElectrothermal vaporization \u2013 inductively coupled plasma \u2013 \nmass spectrometry (ETV-ICP-MS) has proved to be an efficient \napproach for direct solid sample analysis, especially for quantitation of \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n23 \n\n?\n\nvolatile elements and/or for the analysis of samples that are not suitable \nfor conventional sample preparation protocols [69]. The use of \nelectrothermal vaporization (ETV) adds the possibility to remove the \nmajor matrix load during the pyrolysis step and the use of aqueous or \nsolid standards for calibration. \n\n The fact that devices especially designed for solid sample \nanalysis by ETV-ICP-MS are not commercially available has limited the \nnumber of publications and applications of this technique to only a few \nexamples that are available in the literature, thus, this field of research is \nbelieved to be very promising and still holds potential for exploitation. \n\nAntes et al. (2013) have developed a system for direct solid \nanalysis by ETV-ICP-MS. The system was applied with success for the \ndetermination of Cl in petroleum coke using standard addition \ncalibration in order to correct for differences in the behavior of the \nanalyte in the sample and in the calibration standards [69]. The first \napplication of the ETV for halogen determination was described by Yan \net al. (1996). In their work, an ETV was developed and successfully \nemployed for the determination of Br, Cl and I in aqueous standards \nusing a He-Ar plasma, resulting in a more energetic plasma, and \ntherefore, better sensitivity for halogen determination using ICP-MS \n[47]. \n\n1.4.3. Solid sample analysis by ICP-MS \n\nDirect analysis of solids by ICP-MS is usually accomplished by \nusing either a laser ablation system (LA-ICP-MS) (Figure 5) or, less \ncommon ETV-ICP-MS. \n\nAnalysis by LA is based on the focusing of a laser beam on the \nsurface of the sample, which is kept in an inert atmosphere. The pulsed \nlaser converts part of the sample in an aerosol or vapor, which is carried \nby an inert gas to the ICP [70]. \n\nApplication of LA extends to several fields of research and is \nparticularly popular in geochemistry, where LA-ICP-MS has become \none the main techniques for multielemental determination and isotopic \ndating, besides being able to map the distribution of chemical elements \nin the samples.   \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n24 \n\n?\n\nFigure 5. Simplified scheme of LA-ICP-MS [70]. Reprinted \nfrom Mass Spectrom. Rev., Vol. 29, Resano, M., Garcia-Ruiz, E., \nVanhaecke, F., Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass \nspectrometry in archaeometric research, p. 55\u201378, 2010, Copyright \n(2016), with permission from WILEY. \n\nThe main disadvantage associated to the use of LA is the \ndifficulty to attain a suitable calibration approach for quantification due \nto the need for standards with the same characteristics of the samples \n[70]. Therefore, differences in vapor formation and transportation \nbetween sample and standards may lead to errors, requiring special \napproaches for calibration using this technique [60].  \n\nAnother drawback of the technique is related to the cost of the \nequipment when compared to other sample introduction systems, \nbesides that isotope fractionation is more likely to occur in these systems \n[60]. \n\nAll in all, LA has been applied successfully for halogen \ndetermination by several authors in several matrices presenting the goal \nof performing spatially resolved analysis. Most of the authors have used \nisotope dilution ID as a calibration approach to counteract the \ndifferences between samples and standards [71, 72].\n\nOn the other hand, the use of ETV-ICP-MS may expand the \npossibilities for direct solid quantification by ICP-MS, enabling the use \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n25 \n\n?\n\nof aqueous standards for calibration and the sample pretreatment in situ\n[39]. \n\nIn ETV-ICP-MS (Figure 6), an aliquot of the sample is inserted \ninto a graphite furnace (GF) and a temperature program is applied. The \ntemperature program functions as an in situ sample pretreatment step \ninside of the GF, allowing the elimination of the solvents (in the case of \nliquid and slurry samples) during a drying step and the elimination of \nthe matrix of the sample during a pyrolysis step. After the solvents and \nmatrix of the sample have been eliminated, the analytes are volatized \nand carried to the plasma during the vaporization step [73]. \n\nFigure 6.

In order to vaporize the samples, the electrodes \nconnected to the vaporizer cell provide energy capable to produce \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n26 \n\n?\n\ntemperatures as high as 2,800 oC (for example), which is suitable for the \nvaporization of most elements of the periodic table. Once vaporized, the \nanalytes and eventually other concomitants from the matrix are carried \nto the ICP by a carrier gas flow (normally Ar) [73]. \n Typically, in ETV-ICP-MS a temperature program is applied, \nwhich includes drying, pyrolysis and vaporization steps. During the \ndrying step, solvents and products with lower volatilization temperatures \nfrom the sample are eliminated, whereas in the pyrolysis step the main \nobjective is to eliminate matrix components, preventing them to be \ncarried to the ICP during the vaporization step [73, 74].  \n The pyrolysis step must be carefully optimized in order to \nprevent plasma loading without promoting the concomitant vaporization \nof the analyte. Chemical modifiers may be used to increase the thermal \nstability of the analyte, allowing the use of elevated pyrolysis \ntemperatures, and improve the analyte transfer from the ETV to the ICP. \nChemical modifiers may be used either as a solution, in which case the \nmodifier is co-injected with each sample aliquot, or it may be deposited \nonto the graphite tube surface, providing thermal stability to the analytes \nand /or acting as an aerosol carrier [39, 74].  \n\nThe vaporization step follows pyrolysis, volatilizing the \nanalytes that are then carried to the ICP. During the pyrolysis step \n(Figure 6A) the internal gas flow flushes all the vapors out of the \nvaporizer cell, while during the vaporization step (Figure 6B) the orifice \nof the vaporizer cell is sealed by a graphite tip and the internal gas flow \ncarries the analytes to the ICP [39, 74].  \n\nThe use of ETV is suitable for analysis of liquid, slurry and \nsolid samples (using a special apparatus for insertion of the sample into \nthe graphite tube). V\u00f6lkopf et al. have developed the \u201ccup-in-tube\u201d \ntechnique, with the purpose of introducing solid samples directly into \nthe graphite tube [74]. In this technique, the sample is weighed inside of \nglass capillary tubes and transferred into the cup that can be inserted in \nthe graphite tube (Figure 7). \n\n\n\n  Chapter 1 \n\n27 \n\n?\n\nFigure 7. Cup-in-tube technique for ETV-ICP-MS [Adapted from 75, \nwith permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry. \n\nThe advantages of the use of ETV-ICP-MS are the possibility \nof analysis of micro sized samples, high transport efficiency of analytes \nto the plasma when compared to conventional sample introduction \nsystems, possibility to analyze organic samples and also samples with \nhigh solid content, possibility of calibration using aqueous standards, \npossibility of analysis of solid and slurry samples and separation of the \nanalyte from the matrix of the sample due to the temperature program \napplied, reducing the risk of interferences [39-40,74]. \n\nIn quantitative analysis using SS-ETV-ICP-MS, the calibration \nstrategies include external calibration against aqueous standards, solid \nstandards (CRMs), by standards addition, with or without internal \nstandards, and ID [74]. \n\nThe use of external calibration with aqueous standards, which is \nwidely used for quantification of trace elements in digested samples, is a \nvery attractive alternative for quantification by ICP-MS. However, in \nSS-ETV-ICP-MS this approach is sometimes not feasible, since the \nanalytes in the sample are normally present in a different form than the \nanalytes in the aqueous standards, resulting in different thermal behavior \n[39]. Calibration using solid standards, mainly using CRMs with similar \ncomposition to that of the samples, may result in better accuracy due to \nthe similarity of the matrices [69].  \n\nUnder special circumstances, standard addition calibration may \nbe used when solid standards are not available [69]. ID may also be \nhelpful in these cases, although it requires isotopically enriched \nstandards, which are expensive. \n\n\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Application of direct solid sample analysis for \n\nthe determination of chlorine in biological materials using ETV-\n\nICP-MS  \n\nNote: Portions of the text and data discussed in this chapter are \nreproduced or adapted from the publication authored by de Gois, J.

Introduction \n\nChlorine is regularly produced by industries worldwide and has \napplications that range from purification of drinking water to the \nproduction of bleached paper, plastics, solvents and pharmaceuticals \n[76].  \n\nGiven the widespread use of Cl, exposition to the element \noccurs frequently due to manipulation of products, transportation or \neven due to environmental contamination [76, 77]. According to the \nAgency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry, exposure to Cl may \naffect the respiratory tract and eyes, causing acute irritation and \ntriggering inflammatory processes [78].  \n\nMonitoring of Cl in biological and botanical materials is \ncharacterized by difficulties that extend from sample pretreatment until \nthe final instrumental determination [79].  \n\nSample preparation must be carefully conducted in order to \navoid contamination and analyte loss; acid digestion, which is most \nfrequently used as a sample treatment procedure, is not recommended \ndue to the formation of HCl, which can be lost by volatilization. \nMoreover the instrumental determination frequently suffers from poor \nsensitivity, risk of interferences, low analytical throughput and, on \noccasions, high analytical cost [69, 47, 79 - 81]. \n\nHence, the goal of this work was to develop a method for the \ndirect determination of Cl in biological and botanical samples using SS-\nETV-ICP-MS, including a systematic investigation of calibration \nprotocols. \n\n  \n2.2. Experimental \n\n2.2.1. Instrumentation \n\nAll experiments were carried out using an Elan ICP-MS, \nequipped with an HGA-600 MS electrothermal vaporizer and an AS-60 \nautosampler (Perkin-Elmer SCIEX, Thornhill, Canada). Platinum \nsampling and skimmer cones were used, the optimized conditions of the \nICP-MS were 1300W of RF power, 0.7 L min-1 of nebulizer gas flow, \n1.2 L min-1 of auxiliary gas, 15.0 L min-1 of main gas, dwell time for the \nreadings of 50 ms, detector voltages of 1250 V for pulse mode and -\n2280 V for analogue mode.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n32 \n\n?\n\nAll measurements were carried out in Peak Hopping scanning \nmode and autolens mode on. The \u2018cup-in-tube\u2019 technique described by \nVollkopf et al. [75] was used, where the sample introduction opening of \nthe pyrolytically coated graphite tube is enlarged so that the sampling \n\u2018cup\u2019 can be inserted directly into the GF using Teflon tweezers.  \n\nThe solid sampling cup is made from high-density \nelectrographite and coated with pyrolytic graphite and has approximate \ndimensions of 7.0 x 4.5 x 6.8 mm, and it supports a maximum of 160 \nmg of sample [75]. The solid sampling cups, loaded with the sample \n(using a glass capillary), were inserted into the graphite tube and \nremoved after completion of the analysis using a special apparatus. \n\n  The solid samples were weighed using a micro balance model \nM2P (Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). Argon with a purity of 99.996% \n(White Martins, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) was used as plasma, carrier and \ninternal gas of the ETV. \n\nIn order to provide comparative results for samples with \nunknown Cl concentration, a ContrAA 600 high-resolution continuum \nsource atomic absorption spectrometer (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, \nGermany) with a transversely heated graphite tube atomizer was used. \nThe SrCl molecule was used for quantitative measurements of Cl at \n635.863 nm, using integrated absorbance of three pixels (peak volume \nselected absorbance (PVSA) A?3,int).  \n\nPyrolytically coated graphite tubes (Analytik Jena) were used \nin all experiments. The solid samples were weighed directly onto solid \nsampling platforms (Analytik Jena) using an M2P micro balance. A \nmanual solid sampling system, SSA 6 (Analytik Jena), was used to \ninsert the SS platforms into the graphite tube. The optimized pyrolysis \nand vaporization temperatures for the HR-CS MAS technique were \n600oC and 2300oC, respectively. \n\n2.2.2.  Reagents, standards and samples  \n\nAll reagents used were at least of analytical grade. Deionized \nwater was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, \nUSA) with a resistivity of ?18.2 M? cm. Individual stock standard \nsolutions containing 1000 mg L-1 of Ca or Cl were obtained from \nQuimilab (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil). A 1000 mg L-1 Pd stock standard solution \nfrom Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, US), a 1000 mg L-1 Nd (Spex, New \nJersey, US), Sr (Vetec, Duque de Caxias, Brazil) and Zr  solution \n(Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) were used. The liquid samples and \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n33 \n\n?\n\nmodifiers (at a concentration of 1000 mg L-1) were automatically \ninserted into the GF in 20 \u00b5L aliquots using the autosampler. \n\n The following Standard Reference materials (SRM) were used: \nCorn Bran (SRM 8433), Bovine Muscle Powder (SRM 8414), Whole \nEgg Powder (SRM 8415), Wheat Flour (SRM 1567a), Bovine Liver \n(SRM 1577b) and Non-Fat Milk Powder (SRM 1549) all from NIST \n(Gaithersburg, USA); Pig Kidney (BCR 186) and Mussel Tissue (BCR \n278R), both from IRMM (Geel, Belgium) and Beef Liver (NCS-ZC \n71001) from NACIS (Beijing, China). \n\n2.2.3. Analytical procedure \n\nCarrier gas flow rate, RF power and pyrolysis and vaporization \ntemperatures (Tp and Tv, respectively) were optimized using the \ncertified sample SRM 8414 for solid sampling studies as the \nconcentration of Cl in this sample is within the concentrations expected \nin the samples. A 50 mg L-1 Cl solution was also used to investigate the \nexperimental parameters.  \n\nThe use of modifiers was evaluated by pipetting Pd and the \nmixture of Ca + Pd and Nd + Pd as acidic aqueous solutions directly \nonto the solid samples. For comparison, the modifiers were also pre-\ndried into the sampling cup, prior to insertion of the solid samples or \naqueous standards. For the studies involving aqueous solutions, 10 \u00b5L \naliquots of each modifier were added concomitantly to the samples.  \n\nAlternatively, the sampling cup was pre-treated with a total of \n200 \u00b5g Pd as permanent modifier (10 injections of 20 \u00b5L of the stock \nsolution). Calcium and Nd were then pre-dried using a Tp of 1000oC \n[82], before the addition of each sample. \n\nChlorine determination in SRM was carried out using \ncalibration against aqueous or solid standards using Pd + Nd or Pd + Ca \npre-dried as modifiers and also without modifier using a solid standard. \nThe calibration range extended from 0.2 to 3.0 \u00b5g Cl. All measurements \nwere carried out monitoring the isotope 35Cl.  \n\nThe heating temperature of the ETV is based on the 1: solvent \nand acid removal at 1,000oC for 10s when pre-dried modifiers were \nused, 2: insertion of the sample at 20oC, 3: Drying step at 100oC for 10s, \n4: Pyrolysis step at the optimal temperature for each modifier for 10 s \nand 5: Vaporization step at the optimal temperature for each modifier \nfor 18 s. The whole process considering the removal and inserting of the \ncup containing the sample takes about 4 min.\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n34 \n\n?\n\nIn order to establish a comparison of the results with those \nfrom an alternative technique, the biological samples were directly \nweighed (approximately 0.05 to 0.5 mg) onto SS platforms, previously \ntreated with a total of 400 \u00b5g (10 injections of 40 \u00b5L containing 40 \u00b5g \nof the modifier) of zirconium as a permanent chemical modifier. \nSubsequently, 10 \u00b5L (2% m/v) of the molecule-forming Sr solution (as \nSrCO3) was pipetted onto the biological samples and introduced into the \nGF to be submitted to the temperature program, aiming at the \ndetermination using HR-CS MAS.  \n\n2.3. Results and discussion \n\n2.3.1. Optimization of ICP-MS operating parameters \n\nInitial experiments involved optimizing the ICP-MS \nparameters, which include the carrier gas flow rate and the plasma RF \npower, in addition to the evaluation of the short-term signal stability.  \n\n The carrier (internal) gas flow rate exerted significant \ninfluence on the analytical signal, as also observed by Antes et al. [69]. \nThe analytical signal was found to be maximum at a carrier gas flow \nrate of 0.7 L min-1 (Figure 8a), and symmetrical peaks were observed \nunder this condition. Higher gas flow rates resulted in significant \ndecrease in sensitivity, suggesting that the transport efficiency of Cl \nfrom the ETV to the ICP is critically influenced by this parameter. \nHence, a carrier gas flow rate of 0.7 L min-1 was selected for further \nexperiments. \n\n The RF power (Figure 8b) was also investigated, since the \nhigh ionization potential of Cl (12.97 eV) would require a \nproportionally high plasma power to provide optimum sensitivity. \nIncreasing the RF power from 800 to 1300 W resulted in an increase in \nsensitivity by a factor of two, as expected. Hence, the RF power was \nmaintained at 1300 W for further experiments.  \n\nConsidering the organic nature of the samples and the \npossibility of deposition of carbon on the cones with a direct effect on \nthe analytical signal [69-72], a short-time stability study was conducted \nby adding mass aliquots of about 500 \u00b5g of the solid sample SRM 8414 \nand monitoring the integrated signal for 40 min. In order to establish a \ncomparison, an aqueous standard was also evaluated, and a relatively \nlow pyrolysis temperature was adopted (200 oC) in order to simulate an \nextreme condition.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n35 \n\n?\n\nFigure 8. Effect of instrumental operating parameters on the analytical \nsignal for Cl (monitoring the isotope 35Cl) obtained by ETV-ICP-MS: \n(a) carrier gas flow rate and (b) RF power. Results are shown using the \nSRM 8414 solid sample and for an aqueous standard without the use of \nmodifiers; in both cases, the absolute Cl mass inserted is approximately \n1 \u00b5g. Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures were set at 500 and 2000 \noC, respectively. \n\nFigure 9. Short-time stability for Cl using about 500 \u00b5g of the sample \nSRM 8414 and an aqueous standard without the use of modifiers, \nmonitoring the isotope 35Cl. Conditions: pyrolysis and vaporization \ntemperatures 200 oC and 2000 oC, respectively; 0.7 L min-1 carrier gas \nflow rate and 1300 W RF power. Each individual signal obtained from \nSS-ETV-ICP-MS was normalized to 1 mg of sample; individual counts \nwere divided by the signal obtained in the first measurement in each \nseries.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n36 \n\n?\n\nThe results, shown in Figure 9, demonstrate that the analytical \nsignal did not suffer from significant drift over the evaluated period, \nsuggesting that the sample matrix was efficiently eliminated even at low \npyrolysis temperatures and/or the residual matrix that was transported to \nthe ICP could be fully decomposed prior to introduction of the ion \nstream into the MS. Visual inspection of the sampling and skimmer \ncones following this experiment has also attested the absence of \ndeposited material, corroborating this assumption. \n\n2.3.2. Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures \n\nThe transient signals obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-MS using either \naqueous standards or solid samples were symmetrical (slightly tailed) \nand relatively short even without the use of modifiers, as shown in \nFigure 10.  \n\nFigure 10. Signal profile obtained by ETV-ICP-MS. Conditions: \npyrolysis and vaporization temperatures 500 oC and 2000 oC, \nrespectively; 0.7 L min-1 carrier gas flow rate and 1300 W RF power \nmonitoring the isotope 35Cl: a) is aqueous standard signal for 1 \u00b5g of Cl \nand b) is solid standard RM 8414 for 0.2 \u00b5g of Cl both without the use \nof modifiers.  \n\nConsidering the difference in sensitivity that was detected \nbetween aqueous standards and solid samples observed in Figure 10, an \nevaluation of the effect of chemical modifiers was performed as an \nattempt to stabilize Cl in aqueous solutions and to equalize the \nsensitivity for both aqueous and solid standards, which would exert an \nimportant influence on the quantification process. \n\nCalcium and Nd were firstly evaluated, since these elements \nare known to form thermodynamically stable compounds with Cl and \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n37 \n\n?\n\nthe signal profile could be improved with the co-injection of 10 \u00b5g of \nPd, which coincides with the findings of Resano et al. [82], who \nadopted the use of pre-dried Pd as a modifier to carry out iodine \ndetermination by ETV-ICP-MS.  \n\nConsidering these aspects, pyrolysis and vaporization curves \nwere established in the absence of a modifier and also using Pd alone or \nits mixtures with Nd or Ca. The results are shown in Figure 11.  \n\nFigure 11. Pyrolysis and vaporization curves obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-\nMS for Cl in aqueous standards (1 \u00b5g) and in the SRM 8414 (bovine \nmuscle) solid sample: (a) aqueous standard using aqueous modifiers; (b) \nsolid SRM using aqueous modifiers; (c)  aqueous standard using pre-\ndried modifiers; (d) solid SRM using pre-dried modifiers. Each \nindividual signal obtained from SS-ETV-ICP-MS was normalized to 1 \nmg of sample; signals were also normalized to the highest signal \nachieved in each individual curve. Error bars present the RDS on the y \nscale. \n\nThe use of Pd + Ca as an aqueous chemical modifier for Cl in \naqueous solutions (Figure 11a) reduced the analyte loss at temperatures \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n38 \n\n?\n\nhigher than 200 \u00baC and/or contributed to an improved transport \nefficiency of the analyte to the ICP.  \n\nCuriously, the sensitivity was significantly reduced when a \nmixture of Pd and Nd was employed, suggesting either a strong \ninteraction of the analyte with the modifiers in the condensed phase, \nhence reducing the vaporization efficiency, or a reduction in transport \nefficiency of the analyte to the ICP.      \n\nThe effect of chemical modifiers pipetted onto solid SRM 8414 \nis shown in Figure 11b. The curves demonstrate that the analytical \nsignal tends to decrease with increasing pyrolysis temperature, \nsuggesting that premature volatilization of the analyte occurs.  \n\nThe only condition that allowed the signal to be maintained \napproximately constant was the absence of a modifier. Overall, the \nresults shown in Figures 11a and 11b demonstrate that the efficiency of \nchemical modifiers is somewhat limited and the performance is similar \nor worse than when no modifier is used in the process. A possible \nconclusion is that somehow the presence of nitric acid from the liquid \nmodifiers medium is leading to the formation of HCl during the stages \nof thermal pre-treatment and, hence, results in premature loss of the \nanalyte.  \n\nIn order to avoid any potential effect deriving from the \npresence of acids in the GF, the modifiers were pre-dried onto the \ninternal surface on the solid sampling cup prior to insertion of the solid \nsamples or aqueous standards. In this sense, Pd was thermally deposited \nonto the sampling cup by successive injections of the liquid modifier, \nfollowed by application of a specific temperature program in order to \nform a coating containing 200 \u00b5g of deposited Pd. The additional \nmodifiers, Nd or Ca, were pre-dried onto the Pd-modified surface \nimmediately before the injection or insertion of the samples [82].  \n\nThe results, shown in Figures 11c and 11d, demonstrate that the \npre-dried modifiers allowed significant thermal stability for Cl to be \nachieved. Considering the aqueous standard, maximum pyrolysis \ntemperatures of 600 oC using Pd + Nd and 700 oC using Pd + Ca \n(Figure 11c) could be used, whereas Cl in the solid SRM was \nmaintained stable at up to 1000 \u00baC, using permanently deposited Pd \nmixed with either Ca or Nd, in their pre-dried forms.  \n\nIn general, higher stability was observed using the Nd or Ca co-\nmodifiers with Pd, which may be related to the high dissociation energy \nof the molecules formed between Cl and Nd or Ca [83].  Based on \nFigure 11, the optimized pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures used \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n39 \n\n?\n\nfor the determination were respectively, 200oC and 2000oC without the \nuse of modifiers, 300oC and 2100oC using Pd as modifier, 600oC and \n1500oC using Pd + Nd pre-dried as modifier and 700oC and 1800oC \nusing Pd + Ca pre-dried as modifier  \n\n2.3.3. Evaluation of potential interference from sulfur on the \nanalytical signal  \n\nSulfur may promote spectral interference at m/z 35 due to the \nformation of 1H34S+. Since sulfur may be present at relatively high \nconcentrations in the analyzed samples, a simulation was carried out to \nevaluate whether any interference would occur under the conditions \nadopted in this work. Hence, an aqueous solution containing 250 mg L-1 \n\nS was analyzed using a low Tp (200 oC), in order to prevent \nvolatilization of the element during thermal pre-treatment. The resulting \ntransient signal, measured at m/z = 35 and also at m/z 34 (for reference), \nis shown in Figure 12. \n\nThe peak area values obtained at m/z 35 were similar to those \nobserved from blank solutions, regardless of the chemical modifier \nadopted, which suggests that interference from polyatomic 1H34S+ is \nunlikely to occur.  \n\nFigure 12. Signal obtained from the vaporization of 5.0 \u00b5g of S using \nSS-ETV-ICP-MS at m/z 34 and 35. Conditions: pyrolysis and \nvaporization temperatures 200 oC and 2000 oC, respectively; 0.7 L min-1\n\ncarrier gas flow rate and 1300 W RF power; no modifier was used.\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n40 \n\n?\n\n2.3.4. Calibration and analytical accuracy  \n\nCalibration against aqueous standards is a fast and simple \napproach, but the fundamental requirement is that the behavior of the \nanalyte (i.e. the relative sensitivity) in aqueous standards and in the \nsamples should be similar.  \n\nHowever, analytical procedures employing SS frequently suffer \nfrom pronounced matrix effects deriving from the presence of \nsignificant amounts of matrix inside the GF [40]. The situation becomes \neven more complex when transportation between the ETV and the ICP \nis considered, since the solid particles from the matrix may assist in the \nprocess of nucleation and the transport efficiency from solid samples \nmay be significantly better than from aqueous standards. \n\nHence, in order to establish an adequate calibration procedure, \ncalibration curves were obtained for a sample mass ranging from 0.1 to \n1.5 mg of the SRM 8414 (bovine muscle), corresponding the range \nfrom 0.188 \u00b5g to 2.820 \u00b5g of Cl, herewith denominated calibration \nagainst a solid sample, and also using aqueous standards resulting in the \ninsertion of Cl masses that varied from 0.2 to 3.0 \u00b5g. Both calibration \napproaches were evaluated with and without the use of pre-dried \nmodifiers, as discussed in the previous session. The resulting figures of \nmerit are shown in Table 1. \n\nTable 1.

Apparently, the interaction with the \nmodifier and/or the transport efficiency in these cases is concentration-\ndependent, resulting in polynomial calibration curves.  \n\nThe use of pre-dried Pd + Ca or Pd + Nd as chemical modifiers \nresulted in similar sensitivities for calibration against aqueous standards \nand against a solid SRM, suggesting that calibration against aqueous \nstandards would be a feasible approach. In essence, it can be assumed \nthat analyte interaction with the chemically modified surface is more \nsignificant than the analyte interaction with the matrix, an effect that \nultimately normalizes the analyte thermal stability and the transport \nefficiency between aqueous solutions and the solid sample.   \n\nAs illustrated before (Figure 10), if no modifiers were used, \nlower signals resulted from the analysis of aqueous standards when \ncompared to a solid SRM, even when the nominal analyte mass \nintroduced into the furnace via the aqueous standard exceeded the Cl \nmass in the solid SRM. This was attributed to the loss of Cl during \ndrying and pyrolysis steps, which were conducted at 100 oC and 500 oC, \nrespectively. In contrast, the chemical interaction of chlorine species \nwith the solid matrix appeared to be sufficient to maintain the analyte in \nthe condensed phase under the conditions adopted in this work. \nTherefore, it is assumed that the used of modifiers is necessary when \nthe use of aqueous standards is aimed. \n\n The limit of quantification (LOQ) was calculated as 10 times \nthe standard deviation of ten measurements of the empty SS cup divided \nby the slope of the calibration curve obtained, and adjusted to the \naverage sample mass used in the analytical procedure. Using SS-ETV-\nICP-MS in this work a LOQ of  5 \u00b5g g-1 was achieved, which is \ncomparable to that obtained by Antes et al. for petroleum coke samples \n(3.5 \u00b5g g-1), although using sample mass aliquots that are ten times \nhigher than those typically used in this work.   \n\nThis means that the current approach, using pre-dried modifiers \nand calibration against aqueous standards, is about 10 times more \nsensitive than the method previously described, with significantly lower \nsample consumption [28]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n42 \n\n?\n\n Some other techniques which require sample pretreatment as \npyrohydrolysis combined with IC can achieve LOQ of 1 \u00b5g g-1 [80]. \nHowever using a considerable mass of sample (1g) and the \ndetermination by HR-CS-GF-MAS after acid digestions using 100 mg \nachieving a LOQ of about 3 \u00b5g g-1 [84]. However those techniques \nrequire extra procedures, equipment, reagents and a relatively high mass \nof sample. \n\nFive SRMs were analyzed using calibration against a solid \nSRM and also against aqueous standards in the absence of a modifier \nand using pre-dried Pd + Nd or Pd + Ca. The results are presented in \nTable 2. As can be seen, the concentrations obtained using SS-ETV-\nICP-MS are in good agreement with the certified values at a 95% \nstatistical confidence level, regardless of the calibration approach \nadopted.  \n\nThe fact that calibration against aqueous standards can be \napplied without compromising the accuracy and regardless of the nature \nof the sample is remarkable and it is described for the first time for the \ndirect analysis of solid samples using SS-ETV-ICP-MS aiming at \nhalogens determination.  \n\nThree SRM without certified Cl concentrations were also \nanalyzed using SS-ETV-ICP-MS. In these cases, the results were \ncompared to those obtained from the analysis using HR-CS-GF-MAS \n(Table 3). The results from both techniques are in good agreement one \nanother.   \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n???\n\n?\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n44 \n\n?\n\n2.4. Conclusions \n\n In order to avoid the typical problems related to Cl \ndetermination by the commonly employed instrumental and sample \npreparation techniques, the use of SS-ETV-ICP-MS may be regarded as \na sensitive and accurate alternative. The methodology is relatively \nsimple, since it does not require any time-consuming sample \npretreatment. Calibration against solid reference materials or against \naqueous standards using Pd + Nd or Pd + Ca was proven feasible for the \ndetermination of Cl in five certified standard materials and three non-\ncertified samples by SS-ETV-ICP-MS. The procedure may probably be \nextended to other biological or botanical samples. \n\n\n\n? ?\n\nChapter 3 - Simultaneous determination of bromine and \n\nchlorine in coal using SS-ETV-ICP-MS \nNote: Portions of the text and data discussed in this chapter are \n\nreproduced or adapted from the publication authored by de Gois, J.

Introduction \n\nChlorine is essential for humans, animals and plants, and is a \nprecious commercial article since ancient times, as it was used, among \nother things, for the conservation of food. Bromine, in contrast, has no \nknown physiological function. Both elements, however, can also be \nhighly toxic and hazardous to the environment, depending on the \ncompound in which they are present and their concentration [1, 8, 9, 85-\n87].  \n\nCoal is a potential source of halogens due to the release of these \nelements to the atmosphere during combustion. The release of Br and Cl \nfrom coal is a serious concern, mainly because coal is, and probably will \nremain for quite some time, employed as a major source of energy in \nmany countries [88]. The presence of these elements in coal, considering \nthe increasing consumption of coal in the last decades, may represent a \nrisk to the environment and consequently for living organisms [89-90].\n\nIn order to avoid the problems related to sample pretreatment \nand also to determine trace levels of Br and Cl, solid sample analysis \nmay be carried out using ETV-ICP-MS, which leads to advantages, such \nas reduced risk of interference, greatly reduced risk of contamination, \nincreased sensitivity and suitability as a simultaneous trace elemental \nanalytical procedure [40]. \n\nGiven the high importance of Br and Cl determination in coal \nsamples and the feasibility of its determination using SS-ETV-ICP-MS, \nthe aim of this work was to develop an analytical method for Br and Cl \ndetermination in coal samples using direct solid sample analysis. \n\n3.2. Experimental \n\n3.2.1. Instrumentation \n\nAll experiments were carried out using an Elan 6000 \ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer equipped with an HGA-\n600 MS electrothermal vaporizer coupled to an autosampler model AS-\n60 from Perkin-Elmer SCIEX (Thornhill, Canada). The cup-in-tube \ntechnique described by Vollkopf et al. [75] was used for solid sampling \nexperiments. The samples were directly weighed into a solid sampling \nglass capillary using a micro-balance model M2P (Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, \nGermany) and transferred to pyrolytically-coated graphite cups from \nPerkin-Elmer (Norwalk, USA).  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n48 \n\n?\n\nThe operating parameters of the ICP-MS instrument are listed \nin Table 4. Argon with a purity of 99.996% from White Martins (S\u00e3o \nPaulo, Brazil) was used as plasma, carrier and internal gas of the ETV.  \n\nA Model contrAA 600 high-resolution continuum source \natomic absorption spectrometer (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany) \nwith a transversely heated graphite tube atomizer was employed for \ncomparison. Pyrolytically coated graphite tubes (Analytik Jena) were \nused in all experiments.  \n\nTable 4.

A manual solid \nsampling system SSA 6 (Analytik Jena) was used to insert the SS \nplatforms into the graphite tube. For the determination of Br, the \noptimized pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures were 800 and 2200 \n\u00b0C, respectively, while for Cl determination the pyrolysis and \nvaporization temperatures were 600 oC and 2300 oC, respectively.  \n\nThe molecular absorption of CaBr molecule was measured at \n625.315 nm and the SrCl molecule was measured at 635.862 nm, both \nusing integrated absorbance over three pixels  PVSA, A?3,int) [91]. \n\n3.2.2. Reagents, standards and samples  \n\nAll reagents used were at least of analytical grade. Deionized \nwater was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, \nUSA) with a resistivity of 18.2 M? cm. Individual stock solutions \n\n\n\n? Chapter 3 \n\n49 \n\n?\n\ncontaining each 1000 mg L-1 Ca, Cl and Br were obtained from \nQuimilab (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), Pd from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, USA) \nand Al, K, P, S and Sr  from Spex (New Jersey, USA). \n\nThe coal CRMs used were BCR-180 and BCR-182 from IRMM \n(Geel, Belgium), NIST 1630a and NIST 1632b from National Institute \nof Standards and Technology (NIST) (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and \nSarm-19 from South Africa Bureau of Standards (Randburg, South \nAfrica). \n\n3.2.3. Analytical procedure \n\nPyrolysis and vaporization temperatures of the ETV, the carrier \ngas flow rate and RF power of the ICP-MS were optimized using the \nCRM BCR-182 for the studies with direct SS analysis, and an aqueous \nsolution containing Br and Cl.  \n\nThe modifiers studied were Pd and its corresponding mixtures \nwith Ca and Al. In the latter cases, 200 ?g Pd was deposited in excess \ninto the sampling cups (10 injections of 20 ?L of a solution containing 1 \ng L-1) whereas Ca and Al were pre-dried using 20 ?L of a solution \ncontaining 1 g L-1 and applying the drying temperature of 100 oC and a \npyrolysis temperature of 1000 oC before the addition of the samples \n[82].  \n\nThe quantification of Br and Cl in the CRM was carried out \nupon calibration using the CRM BCR-182; Br was also quantified \nfollowing calibration against aqueous standard solutions. All \nmeasurements were carried out monitoring the isotopes 79Br and 35Cl. \n\nFor comparison, Br and Cl were also determined by HR-CS GF \nMAS. For Br determination a Ca2+ solution was pipetted directly into \nthe graphite tube as the molecule-forming reagent. The coal samples (?\n0.2\u20133 mg) were directly weighed onto the SS platform previously \ntreated with a total of 400 ?g Zr (10 injections of 40 ?L containing 40 \n?g Zr each) (i.e., which had not to be renewed throughout the lifetime of \nthe platform) and introduced into the GF to be submitted to the \ntemperature program [91]. \n\n Chlorine was determined using Sr2+ as the molecule-forming \nreagent. Coal CRM were directly weighed (? 0.05 to 0.5 mg) onto the \nSS platform, also previously treated with a total of 400 \u00b5g of zirconium \nas a permanent chemical modifier. Afterwards, 10 \u00b5L (2% m/v) of the \nmolecule-forming Sr solution (as SrCO3) has been injected over the coal \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n50 \n\n?\n\nsamples on the SS platform and introduced into the GF to be submitted \nto the temperature program [92].  \n\n3.3. Results and discussion \n\n3.3.1. Optimization of ICP-MS operating parameters \n\nRF power and carrier gas flow-rate were optimized aiming at \nmaximum sensitivity for the analytes. The results are shown in Figures \n13a and 13b. The RF power was evaluated (Figure 13a) and maximum \nsignal was obtained at 900 W for Br and at 1200 W for Cl, using the \nBCR-182 coal CRM. This difference is related to the ionization potential \nof each element; Br an Cl have ionization potentials of 11.81 eV and \n12.97 eV, respectively, which means that Cl requires more energy to be \nionized. Since the sensitivity associated to Cl determination is lower \nthan for Br, the RF power was chosen to be 1200 W. \n\nFigure 13. Effect of carrier gas flow-rate (A) and RF power (B) on the \nanalytical signal obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-MS for Br and Cl in BCR-\n182 coal CRM and in aqueous standard solutions. Pyrolysis and \nvaporization temperatures were set at 400 \u00b0C and 2000 oC, respectively. \nNormalized signals refer to the ratio between the individual signal and \nthe highest signal in the series. \n\nThe carrier gas flow-rate influences the sensitivity and the \nanalytical signal profile, as already observed by Antes et al. [69] for Cl \ndetermination in coke samples. In our work, the carrier gas flow-rate did \nnot exert significant influence on the analytical signal profile, and a \nmaximum intensity was achieved with a carrier gas flow-rate of 1.1 L \nmin-1 (Figure 13b).  \n\n\n\n? Chapter 3 \n\n51 \n\n?\n\n3.3.2. Evaluation of pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures  \n\nPyrolysis and vaporization temperatures were evaluated in \nparallel with a study of modifiers/aerosol carriers. In addition to \nincreased thermal stability, the use of modifiers was evaluated as a \nmeans to equalize the sensitivity for both aqueous standard solutions and \nsolid samples, which would allow the subsequent determination of Br \nand Cl using calibration against aqueous standard solutions. \n\nCalcium and Al were chosen due to their high bonding energies \nwith Br and Cl, which has led to their use as molecule forming reagents \nin halogen determination by HR-CS MAS [83].  \n\nThe use of Ca and Al as individual modifiers, however, resulted \nin distorted transient peaks, and symmetrical signals could only be \nobtained upon the concomitant use of Pd, a finding that is in agreement \nwith similar studies by Resano et al. [82]. Hence, the combined Pd + Ca \nand Pd + Al modifiers were evaluated as to their ability to improve the \nthermal stability for the analytes.  \n\nPyrolysis and vaporization curves are shown in Figure 14 for \naqueous standard solutions and a solid CRM. Figure 14 demonstrates \nthat in the absence of modifiers, analyte losses occur already at pyrolysis \ntemperatures as low as 200 \u00b0C for aqueous standards, whereas higher \nstability is observed for the solid sample, which is likely due to the \ncovalent interaction of Cl and Br with matrix components. \n\nIn general, the use of chemical modifiers provided a significant \nincrease in thermal stability for both analytes in the aqueous solution, \nbut there is also an improvement in stability for the solid samples. The \nuse of Pd + Ca provided the best thermal stability for aqueous standards \ncompared to Pd alone and Pd + Al in all cases.  \n\nOverall, it is likely that the thermal stability provided by the \nmodifiers acts together with improved transport efficiency in the \npresence of Pd + Ca or Al, which is likely to occur due to the favorable \ninteraction between the halogens and Ca and Al, particularly. The \noptimum conditions chosen for each modifier are presented in Table 5  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n52 \n\n?\n\nFigure 14.

Chapter 3 \n\n53 \n\n?\n\n3.3.3.  Evaluation of potential interfering species \n\nSpectral interferences can drastically affect the accuracy of the \nmeasurements, particularly considering the formation of polyatomic ions \nsuch as 16O18O1H+ and 34S1H+, which overlap with 35Cl+; 36Ar1H+ and \n36S1H+ which overlap  with 37Cl+; 40Ar39K+, 31P16O3\n\n+ and 38Ar40Ar1H+, \nwhich overlap with 79Br+ and finally 32S16O3\n\n1H+, 40Ar40Ar1H+ and \n33S16O3\n\n+,which overlap with 81Br+. Since coal usually contains \nsubstantial amounts of S and K, an interference evaluation was \nnecessary to assure the correctness of the quantification. \n\nFigure 15.  Analytical signal profiles obtained from 20 ?L injections of \naqueous solutions containing 500 mg L-1 of K, P or S, P or K; pyrolysis \nand vaporization temperatures 100 oC and 2000 oC, respectively. A and \nB refer to the signal profile obtained for the BCR-182 coal CRM using a \nsample mass of 100 \u00b5g, and C, D and E refer to the signal profiles \nobtained for aqueous solutions containing S, P and K, respectively. \n\nIn order to evaluate if interfering species could be present and \naffect the accuracy of the measurements, aqueous solutions containing \n500 mg L-1 of K, P and S were analyzed using the lowest pyrolysis \ntemperature possible (100 oC), in order to avoid volatilization during this \nstep.  \n\nAs can be seen in Figure 15, although the peaks at the \nrespective m/z of K, S and P were pronounced, as shown by the green \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n54 \n\n?\n\nline, baseline values were obtained for Cl and Br in their respective m/z, \nwhich leads to the assumption that no interference due to polyatomic ion \nformation takes place under the conditions adopted. This should be even \nless significant considering that a higher pyrolysis temperature was \nchosen for the quantification, with further reduction in the population of \nconcomitant species in the ICP [40]. \n\n3.3.4. Figures of merit and analytical application \n  \n\nAlthough calibration against aqueous standard solutions is \nregarded as the simplest procedure available for quantification, the \nbehavior of the analyte in aqueous standard solutions must be similar to \nits behavior in the samples, generating similar responses.  \n\nThis is particularly critical in SS-ETV-ICP-MS, since the \ninfluence of the matrix on analyte vaporization is amplified and the \ntransport efficiency from the ETV to the ICP must be considered. \nHence, calibration against aqueous standard solutions is frequently ruled \nout as a feasible approach in analytical procedures that involve direct \nsampling analysis and ETV-ICP-MS [40]. \n\nTable 6.

Chapter 3 \n\n55 \n\n?\n\nagainst aqueous standard solutions was performed within the range of \n0.02 - 0.10 \u00b5g Br and 0.1 - 5.0 \u00b5g Cl, with and without the use of \nmodifiers and under the optimized pyrolysis and vaporization \ntemperatures presented in Table 6. \n\nTable 6 shows the slope and linear correlation coefficient \nobtained for each calibration approach for both analytes. As shown, \nnone of the modifiers was able to provide a similar sensitivity for \ncalibration against aqueous and solid standards for Cl, which implies \nthat a solid reference material has to be used for calibration.  \n\nThe sensitivity deriving from calibration using BCR-182 was \nsignificantly lower than the one obtained for Cl using aqueous standard \nsolutions, which suggests that either the transport efficiency is improved \nin the latter case or analyte vaporization from the solid matrix is \nhindered by a strong interaction with matrix components. This situation \ncontrasts with the one observed for Br, since for this element the use of \nPd + Ca or Pd + Al provided similar sensitivity for both calibration \napproaches, suggesting that good accuracy could be obtained with \ncalibration against aqueous standard solutions. \n\nAlthough both Pd + Ca and Pd + Al provided similar sensitivity \nfor calibration against aqueous standard solutions and using a solid \nCRM for Br determination, the determination of Br and Cl was carried \nusing Pd + Ca due to the higher thermal stability provided by this \ncombination of modifiers, as can be seen in the pyrolysis and \nvaporization curves shown in Figure 14. \n\nThe sensitivity was also improved with the adoption of Pd + Ca, \nparticularly for Cl. Overall, it can be assumed that the chemical \ninteraction between Br and Ca or Al was effective particularly using a \nsolid sample, since the sensitivity improved as a result of higher \ntransport efficiency and thermal stability. The same effect was noticed \nfor Cl, although the interaction of the analyte with the co-modifier (Ca \nor Al) was not sufficient to equalize the sensitivity for aqueous standard \nsolutions and solid reference material.  \n\nThe LOQ was calculated as 10 times the standard deviation of \nten measurements of the empty cup divided by the slope of the \ncalibration curve, adjusted to the sample mass used for analysis. The \nLOQs obtained were 0.03 \u00b5g g-1 for Br and 7 \u00b5g g-1 for Cl. This is the \nfirst time that detection limit for Br is reported using SS-ETV-ICP-MS; \na comparison with the LOQ of 5 ?g g-1 obtained using SS-HR GF MAS \n[18] shows an improvement of about two orders of magnitude for SS-\nETV-ICP-MS, using approximately the same sample mass. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n56 \n\n?\n\nRegarding Cl, Antes et al. obtained a similar LOQ for \npetroleum coke using SS-ETV-ICP-MS (3.5 \u00b5g g-1), although using \nsample mass aliquots of about 5 mg, i.e. ten times higher than the typical \nsample mass required in the current work [69]. Determination of \nhalogens using laser ablation and ICP-MS provide typically higher \nLOQ, such as 6 \u00b5g g-1 for Br and 27 \u00b5g g-1 for Cl in geological and \nenvironmental samples, as described by Boulyga and Heumann [64]. \n\nChlorine was determined in five coal CRM using calibration \nagainst BCR-181. The results, shown in Table 7, are in agreement with \nthe certified values and with the comparison technique, demonstrating \nthe accuracy of the methodology. \n\nTable 7.

Introduction \n\nHalogens and halogenated compounds differ significantly in \nreactivity, physical properties and toxicity. Although some halogens, \nsuch as Cl and I, are regarded as essential elements to several forms of \nlife, it is generally agreed that the presence of halogens in the \nenvironment is associated to hazards which include their ability to react \nwith O3 molecules and the potential to interfere in the balance of \natmospheric SOx and NOx [14, 93,94]. \n\nThe majority of the atmospheric halogen content comes from \nmarine aerosols, although the emission of halogens from volcanic \neruptions also plays an important role on the dynamics of the halogens \nin the Earth environment [95-96]. \n\nOther sources of halogens include the release of I2 and CH3Br \nfrom algae and land plants and anthropogenic processes [97], such as the \ncombustion of fossil fuels and the manufacturing of polyfluorinated \ncompounds [98], lubricants, varnishes and pesticides [99-100].  \n\nParticulate matter (PM) is normally composed by suspended \nliquids and solid particles floating in the air which are released in the \natmosphere from specific sources or formed by reactions in the \natmosphere. The determination of halogens in PM 10 (droplets from 2.5 \nto 10 \u00b5m in diameter), known as inhalable coarse particle, is an \nimportant task due to the high risk to the public health as they can be \ninhaled and reach the lungs. Moreover this type of analysis can bring \nimportant information about pollution [101].  \n\nGiven the hazardous nature of halogens in the environment and \nseveral mechanisms that lead to their release into the atmosphere, the \ndetermination of halogens in the air is an important - and complex - \nanalytical task. For this purpose, several techniques have been \nhistorically used, and more recently and far less frequently, HR-CS \nMAS and ICP-MS have been described for this task [91]. \n\nThe association between direct solid sampling analysis and the \nabove-mentioned spectrometric techniques has been proven effective for \ntrace element determination in a number of applications, which may be \nparticularly useful in the case of the PM10 analysis, since the presence of \nrelatively high levels of silicates and oxides turn acid-based digestion \ninto complex routines [102]. In addition, the halogens are prone to react \nreadily under acidic conditions and at high temperatures to form their \nrespective hydrogen halides, which are volatile and may be lost during \nthe digestion procedure.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n62?\n\n?\n\nThe use of line source atomic absorption spectrometry is not \nsuitable for fluorine determination due to the fact that its main resonance \nlines are located below 95 nm, which cannot be achieved.  \n\nRecently, the feasibility of adapting a HR-CS atomic absorption \nspectrometer to carry out analysis based on diatomic molecule formation \n(which can absorb over a wider spectral range) inside the GF has been \ndemonstrated for F determination by monitoring molecules such as SrF \n[103], BaF [104], GaF [105], AlF and MgF [106].  \n\nMore recently, Mor\u00e9s et al. [107] demonstrated the feasibility of \ndetermining F by monitoring the CaF molecule at 606.440 nm region, \nwhich is advantageous because of the reduced risk of spectral \ninterferences in this spectral range and the strong absorption intensity of \nthe molecule at this line. This was a major breakthrough for AAS, since \nF cannot be directly determined using ICP-MS, due to the high \nionization potential of this element, which hinders the formation of \npositive and singly ionized ions under the typical operating conditions of \nthe instrument.  \n\nGiven the widespread distribution of halogens in the \nenvironment and the importance and challenges associated with their \ndetermination, the aim of this work was to assess the application of \ndirect solid sample analysis for the determination of F using HR-CS GF \nMAS and Br, Cl and I using ETV-ICP-MS in PM10, a procedure which \nwas applied to the analysis of PM10 from the city of Aracaju, located in \nthe Northeast of Brazil. \n\n4.2. Experimental \n\n4.2.1. Instrumentation \n\n Fluorine determination was carried out using a high-resolution \ncontinuum source atomic absorption spectrometer model ContrAA 700 \n(Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany) with a transversely heated graphite \ntube atomizer. The ContrAA 700 is equipped with a high-intensity \nxenon short-arc lamp operating in \u201chot-spot\u201d mode, a high resolution \nmonochromator consisting of a pre-dispersing prism and an echelle \ngrating monochromator, and a linear array charge coupled device \ndetector (CCD) with 200 analytically accessible pixels. \n\nDirect insertion of the solid samples was accomplished by \nmeans of the SSA 600 automatic solid sampling device (Analytik Jena \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n63 \n\n?\n\nAG). The SSA 600 is composed of a set of tweezers, which transport the \npyrolytically-coated SS-platforms into the GF.  \n\nSolid samples were directly transferred to the SS-platforms \nusing a stainless steel micro spatula. Aqueous standards and reagents \nwere injected manually onto the SS-platform using micropipettes with \ndisposable tips. The CaF diatomic molecule spectrum was used to \ndetermine F in the PM10 samples. The molecular band head at 606.432 \nnm was monitored using only one pixel due to the high intensity of this \nline; the use of less intense lines using more pixels resulted in poor \nprecision compared to this line.  \n\nChlorine, Br and I were determined using an Elan 6000 \ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer equipped with an HGA-\n600 MS ETV device from Perkin-Elmer (Thornhill, Canada). The \u2018cup-\nin-tube\u2019 technique described by Vollkopf et al [75]. was used for the \nsolid sampling experiments. \n\nThe samples were directly weighed using a solid sampling glass \ncapillary and a micro-balance model M2P (Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, \nGermany) and transferred to pyrolytically-coated graphite cups from \nPerkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT, USA). The operating parameters of the \nICP-MS instrument are listed in Table 9. Argon with a purity of \n99.996% (White Martins S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) was used as plasma and \ncarrier gas and as the protective and purge gas of the ETV.  \n\nTable 9.

Reagents, Standards and Samples \n\n All reagents used were at least analytical grade. Deionized \nwater was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, \nUSA) at a resistivity of 18.2 M? cm. Individual stock standard solutions \ncontaining each 1000 mg L-1 Ca (Ca(NO3)2), Cl (KCl), Br (KBr) and I \n(KI) were obtained from Quimilab (S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil), Pd \n(Pd(NO3)2) from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, USA) and F (NaF) from \nSpex (New Jersey, NJ, USA).  \n\nTwo CRMs, NIST 1648 and NIST 1648a Urban Particulate \nMatter, from NIST (Gaithersburg, USA), were used. \n\n4.2.3. Sampling of Airborne Inhalable Particulate Matter \n\n The PM10 samples were collected following the directives of \nthe Brazilian Technical Standards Association (NBR 9547). The \ncollection was carried out using a high volume sampler which was \ninstalled in Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil in a territory administrated by \nSergipe\u2019s Environment and Water Resources Department  (Secretaria de \nEstado do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos H\u00eddricos, Aracaju, SE, Brasil). \nThe sampling location is adjacent to residential and industrial areas, next \nto a region with a relatively intense traffic of motorized vehicles. \n\nSample collection was carried out using glass fiber filters for \nPM10. Prior to use, the glass fiber filters (Energ\u00e9tica, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, \nBrazil) were maintained on a desiccator for 24 h. Collection of PM10\nsamples was carried out using an air flow of 1677 m3 for 24 hours. At \nthe end of the sampling procedure, the samples were placed into a \ndesiccator for 24 h before weighing. Sample collection was carried out \nduring dry and rainy seasons in the period ranging from February 06, \n2013 to June 09, 2013.  \n\n4.2.4. Analytical procedure \n\nThe samples were grinded prior analysis. Fluorine \ndetermination by SS-HR-CS GF MAS was carried out by monitoring the \nCaF molecular absorption band at 606.432 nm, which provided adequate \nsensitivity for the purpose of this work. The absorption spectrum of the \nCaF molecule is shown in Figure 16 for the real PM10 sample from \n02/April/2013. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n65 \n\n?\n\nFigure 16. Wavelength resolved absorption spectrum of the CaF \ndiatomic molecule obtained from a PM10 sample in the 606.15 \u00b1 0.45 \nnm spectral region. Absorbance is normalized to the highest absorbance \nobserved in this spectral window. \n\nPyrolysis and atomization temperatures were optimized using \none of the PM10 samples and the mass of molecule-forming agent (Ca) \nwas optimized using one of the PM10 samples and a standard solution \ncontaining F. The PM10 samples (or standard solution) were directly \nweighed (? 0.2 - 1 mg) onto the SS platform, previously treated with a \ntotal of 400 \u00b5g thermally deposited Pd to act as a permanent chemical \nmodifier [108]. Subsequently, 10 \u00b5L of the molecule-forming Ca \nsolution at 1.0 g L-1 were placed with a micropipette on top of the PM10\nsamples on the SS platform and introduced into the GF, followed by \napplication of the temperature program of the instrument. \n\nChlorine, Br and I determination were carried out using SS-\nETV ICP-MS. Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures of the ETV, the \ncarrier gas flow rate and RF power of the ICP-MS instrument were \noptimized. The modifiers studied were Pd and the mixture of Pd + Ca. In \nthese cases, 200 ?g Pd was deposited onto the internal surface of the \nsampling cups (10 injections of 20 ?L of a 1.0 g L-1 Pd solution), \nwhereas Ca was pre-dried using 20 ?L of a 1.0 g L-1 Ca solution [9, \n105]. The temperature programs of the GF and ETV are presented in \nTable 10. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n66?\n\n?\n\nThe PM10 sample from 02/April/2013, collected in the city of \nAracaju, was used during all optimization steps, whereas NIST 1648 \nCRM was used for calibration.  \n\nMeteorological data were obtained from the Brazilian Weather \nDatabase for Teaching and Research (Banco de Dados Meterol\u00f3gicos \npara Ensino e Pesquisa) [109]. Statistical analysis was performed using \nSTATISTICA v.6.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). All measurements \nwere carried out at least in triplicate. \n\nTable 10.

Results and discussion\n\n4.3.1. Optimization of ICP-MS Operating Parameters  \n\nIn addition to the GF temperature program, the RF power and \nnebulizer gas flow rate may exert significant influence on sensitivity and \nsignal stability for ETV-ICP-MS analysis. \n\nRF power and carrier gas flow rate of the ICP-MS were \noptimized and the results showed that the highest sensitivity was \nachieved upon adoption of an RF power of 1300 W for Cl, 1100 W for \nBr and 1000 W for I. These differences are likely to be related to the \nhigh ionization potential of the elements, which increase in the order Cl \n> Br  > I. Since the most critical element regarding sensitivity is Cl due \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n67 \n\n?\n\nto its high ionization potential (12.97 eV), the selected RF power was \n1300 W.  \n\nSimilarly, the carrier gas flow rate represents a critical factor for \nhalogen determination by ICP-MS, and aspects such as signal profile \nand sensitivity are affected by this parameter [28].  \n\nThe results demonstrated that although the adoption of carrier \ngas flow rates between 0.5 L min-1 and 0.6 L min-1 resulted in higher \nsensitivity, especially for Cl, the RSD were remarkably higher under \nthese conditions, which may be partially attributed to the reduced \ntransfer rate of the analyte containing-vapor through the transfer hose, \nresulting in condensation losses especially for Cl.  \n\nOn the other hand, the adoption of carrier gas flow rates higher \nthan 0.7 L min-1 resulted in reduced sensitivity, which is believed to be \ndue to the reduced residence time of the analytes in the ICP. Considering \nthese aspects, the carrier gas flow rate was set at 0.7 L min-1. \n\n4.3.2. Fluorine measurements using HR-CS-GF MAS \n\nThe molecule forming agent (Ca) must be added favorably in \norder to promote the formation of CaF, ideally without any measurable \nresidue of F on the platform at the end of each analytical cycle. The \nrequired mass of Ca to be added to F-containing samples was evaluated \nusing 100 ng of F in the form of an aqueous standard. Calcium was \nadded as an aqueous solution, prepared from Ca(NO3)2.   \n\nThe effect of increasing Ca mass on the measurable signal \nobtained from the formation of CaF is shown in Figure 17. From this \nfigure, it is clear that at least 6 \u00b5g of Ca are required to achieve \nmaximum sensitivity for CaF produced from an aqueous fluorine \nsolution. \n\nThe situation is less critical for the solid PM10, since the natural \nconcentration of Ca in these samples was typically sufficient to produce \nhigh populations of the CaF molecule even without addition of Ca as an \naqueous solution. Nonetheless, in order to assure sufficient excess of Ca \nin all cases, 10 \u00b5g Ca (10 \u00b5L of a Ca solution at 1.0 g L-1) was added to \nall samples to assure uniform molecule formation regardless of the \nnative Ca content of the samples.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n68?\n\n?\n\nFigure 17. Effect of Ca mass on the signal obtained for the CaF \nmolecule by SS-HR-CS GF MAS at 606.4322 nm using 100 ng of F as \naqueous solution. Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures were set at \n1100 \u00b0C and 2200 oC, respectively. Signal was normalized dividing the \nmeasurements value by the highest measurement value obtained. \n\n4.3.3. Temperature program optimization \n\nThe temperature program should be optimized in order to \npromote efficient vaporization of the analyte during the vaporization \nstep, and ideally most of the matrix should be removed without analyte \nloss during the pyrolysis step. \n\n The pyrolysis (Tp) and vaporization temperatures (Tv) for F (as \nCaF) using SS-HR-CS GF MAS (Figure 18a) and for Cl, Br and I using \nSS-ETV-ICP-MS (Figures 18b-18d) were optimized using a \u2018real\u2019 PM10\nsample (Sample 02/April/2013).  \n\nFor F, it is shown in Figure 18a that a Tp of 1200 oC could be \nused without analyte loss, which is significantly higher than the \npreviously reported values for the CaF molecule [107]. This additional \nstability may be attributed to the use of thermally deposited Pd onto the \nplatform surface as a permanent modifier. A pyrolysis temperature of \n1100 oC was chosen for subsequent studies in order not to reduce the \nlifetime of the graphite tube and SS platform.  \n\nThe vaporization temperature curve, which is also shown in \nFigure 18a, demonstrates that diffusional losses and/or molecule \ndissociation occur to a significant extent at temperatures higher than \n2200 \u00b0C, which was then selected for subsequent experiments.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n69 \n\n?\n\nPyrolysis and vaporization temperature curves obtained using \nSS-ETV-ICP-MS for Cl, Br and I were also evaluated and are shown in \nFigures 18b-18d. Chemical modifiers, which may also act as aerosol \ncarriers, were evaluated.  \n\nThe use of chemical modifiers in the form of acidic solutions \nwas proven to promote analyte losses during the pyrolysis step, which is \nlikely due to the formation of volatile hydrogen halides. Hence, as a \nmeans to remove the acid from the solution, the chemical modifier \nsolutions were pipetted into the graphite tube and submitted to a drying \nstep prior to insertion of the samples.  \n\nFigure 18. Pyrolysis and vaporization curves obtained for (A) CaF using \nSS-HR-CS GF MAS and (B) Cl, (C) Br, and  (D) I using SS-ETV-ICP-\nMS. Operating conditions adopted for SS-ETV-ICP-MS measurements: \n1300 W RF power; 0.7 L min-1 carrier gas flow rate. Normalized signals \nrefer to the ratio between each individual signal and the highest signal in \nthe series. All data were obtained using the 02/April/2013 PM10 sample. \nPalladium was used as permanent chemical modifier for both techniques\nand Ca in solution form was used as molecule-forming agent for SS-HR-\nCS GF MAS and modifier/aerosol carrier for SS-ETV-ICP-MS. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n70?\n\n?\n\nUnder these conditions, thermal stability was achieved for all \nelements up to a pyrolysis temperature of 500 oC, and even in the \nabsence of chemical modifiers a similar thermal stability was observed \u2013 \nan effect that may be related to the presence of Ca in the samples, which \nmay itself act as stabilizing agent. Adoption of a Tp of 500 \u00b0C allowed \nthe analysis to be carried out without deposition of solid residues on the \nsampling cone, which suggests efficient matrix elimination.  \n\nOptimum vaporization temperatures ranged from 1600 oC for \nBr to 2300 oC for I, both without the use of chemical modifiers. As a \ncompromise condition, the Tv was maintained at 2100 oC. Despite the \napparent usefulness of a modifier-free determination, the concomitant \naddition of Pd + Ca was considered necessary in order to decrease the \ninteraction of the analytes with the graphite surface [108], and also as a \nmeans to reduce the potential influence of Ca concentration on the \nsensitivity achieved for the analytes vaporized from different samples.  \n\n4.3.4. Quantification and analytical figures of merit \n\nOne of the challenges of direct solid sample analysis concerns \nthe calibration procedure, since identical analyte behavior in calibration \nstandards and in the solid matrix are, on occasions, hardly achieved. \nStrategies that include the adoption of specific operating conditions of \nthe instrument and the use of chemical modifiers or aerosol carriers are \nfrequently useful in equalizing the behavior of the analyte in standards \nand samples [82].  \n\nIn order to assure maximum similarity between the samples and \nthe calibration standards, the calibration curves were obtained using the \nNIST 1648 CRM for the determination of Br, Cl and I by SS-ETV ICP-\nMS. Since there are no APM reference materials with a certified \nconcentration for F, this element was determined by standard addition \nusing SS-HR-CS GF MAS.  \n\nIn order to check the accuracy of the measurements, the \ncertified reference sample NIST 1648a was analyzed for Br, Cl and I. In \naddition, three \u2018real\u2019 PM10 samples were also analyzed using standard \naddition calibration, in order to further asses the accuracy of the \nprocedure. The results are shown in Table 11. \n\nDue to the high amount of S (5%), K (~1%) and P (~1%) in the \ncertified reference sample NIST 1648, spectral interferences, which are \nrelated to the formation of 34S1H+, which overlaps with 35Cl+, and \n40Ar39K+ and 31P16O3\n\n+ , which overlap with 79Br+, could occur. However, \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n71 \n\n?\n\nas can be seen from the results in Table 11, these interferences do not \npresent a problem with this analytical method.  \n\nIn the previous studies, it was shown that these interferences are \nrarely a concern, since the above-mentioned polyatomic ions are not \nformed quantitatively or are not detected upon vaporization S, K and P \nusing ETV-ICP-MS. Since the determined values were in good \nstatistical agreement (95% confidence level) with the certified values for \nthe analytes in NIST 1648, it is assumed that the procedure is free of \ninterferences.  \n\nSince no CRM for F was available, the determination of the \nreferred element was carried out by standard addition in order to check \nfor the presence of matrix effects. Although standard addition \ncalibration using solid samples and aqueous standards may sound as a \nsomewhat odd approach, the results were useful to demonstrate that the \nadded analyte behaves very similarly to the \u2018native\u2019 analyte present in \nthe solid samples, which validates the approach. \n\nThe precision was determined as the RSD of three replicate \nmeasurements of NIST 1648a CRM. The RSD values ranged between \n0.8% (F) and 12.9% (Cl).   \n\nThe limits of detection were calculated as the ratio between \nthree times the standard deviation of ten blank measurements and the \nslope of the calibration curves, adjusted to the typical sample masses \nthat were inserted in the graphite tube. The calculated values were 0.3 \n\u00b5g g-1 (0.4 ng m3) for F by SS-HR-CS GF MAS, and 0.02 mg g-1 (30 ng \nm3) for Cl, 0.1 \u00b5g g-1 (0.1 ng m3) for Br and 2 ng g-1 (0.003 ng m3) for I \nby SS-ETV-ICP-MS, which are suitable for the analysis of PM10\nsamples. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n72?\n\n?\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n73 \n\n?\n\n4.3.5. Analysis of PM10 samples \n\nThe halogen content of 14 PM10 samples collected during \ndifferent periods in the city of Aracaju was assessed using the newly \ndeveloped methods. Each filter was loaded with PM10 masses ranging \nfrom 29 mg to 59.3 mg, which corresponds with 17 ?g to 36 ?g PM10\nper cubic meter of air. The results are shown in Table 12.  \n\nAs can be seen, the concentration values ranged from 793.4 to \n2642.7 ng m-3 for F, 647 to 7573 ng m-3 for Cl, 1.4 to 17.6 ng m-3 for Br \nand from 1.167 to 4.285 ng m-3 for I. The most significant variation in \nconcentration levels was detected for Cl, which may be related to the \nfact that the samples originate from a coastal region. As expected, Br \nwas the least abundant element in the analyzed samples.  \n\nPrecision, reported as RSD, ranged between 0.8 and 9.2% for F, \n0.6 and 12.9% for Cl, 0.6 and 12.4% for Br and 0.02 and 9.2% for I, \nreferring to triplicate measurements of the PM10 samples. These values \nreflect an adequate sample homogeneity, which was aided by the \ngrinding process of the glass fiber filters containing PM10.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n74?\n\n?\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n75 \n\n?\n\nOverall, the increase trend in F concentration levels were found \nto be opposite to that of the other halogens, whereas variations in Br, Cl \nand I concentrations showed a similar trend. The similarity regarding \nvariations in the concentrations of Cl, Br and I was already described\n[110] and it has been suggested that this behavior is related to the fact \nthat these elements originate mainly from the sea, even though a fraction \nof the Br and I content has also been shown to derive from soil \nemissions, microbial activity and biomass combustion [111].  \n\nFigure 19. Effect of relative air humidity on the determined \nconcentrations of F (obtained by SS-HR-CS GF MAS), Br, Cl and I \n(obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-MS) in airborne inhalable particulate matter \n(PM10) samples. The PM10 samples were collected in the coastal city of \nAracaju, Sergipe, Brazil, between February and June, 2013.  \n\nThe concentrations of Cl, Br and I were directly related to the \nrelative air humidity at the time of collection, in the sense that these \nelements were more abundant in PM10 samples collected at higher \nhumidity conditions. The opposite behavior was observed for F, which \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n76?\n\n?\n\nwas determined to be at higher concentrations in samples collected \nduring reduced air humidity conditions (Figure 19). These results \nsuggest that, in fact, the atmospheric Cl, Br and I content originate from \nsources that differ from those responsible for the presence of F. \n\nThe Br/I concentration ratios varied from 1.0 to 6.4, with an \naverage value of 3.7 \u00b1 1.6. These values are comparable to those \nobserved in Hawaii (approximately 3.5) and in the western pacific ocean \n(approximately 6.4), which is yet another evidence to the fact that these \nelements originate from marine sources [112].  \n\nFluorine concentrations were also related to the sunlight \nincidence (Figure 20). Since the main source of F emission is not fully \nclear, it can be assumed that vaporization of F-containing compounds \nfrom urban dust is more efficient at higher irradiation periods, hence \nincreasing the absolute F concentration in PM10 samples collected after \nlonger sunlight exposure. \n\nIt should be emphasized that the PM10 collection site is \nsurrounded by roads with a relatively intense circulation of motorized \nvehicles, a few industries and a large residential area, which are \nregarded as potential emission sources of inhalable particles to the \natmosphere. Another important factor to be considered is the high \nreactivity of F with fiberglass, therefore it's concentrations may also to F \nin vapor form not only to MP10. \n\nFigure 20. Effect of sunlight irradiation (insolation) on the determined \nconcentration of F obtained by SS-HR-CS GF MAS in airborne \ninhalable particulate matter (PM10) samples collected in the coastal city \nof Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n77 \n\n?\n\nPrincipal component (PC) analysis of the data related to the \nhalogen concentrations in the PM10 samples was carried out in order to \ninvestigate statistically the correlation between the halogen content and \nthe weather conditions at the time of sample collection. The score plot of \nPC1 versus PC2 considering the concentrations of F, Cl, Br and I \n(Figure 21) resulted in the identification of two distinct groups of \nsamples, which are related to the accumulated rainfall during the \ncollection period.  \n\nThe accumulated rainfall during the months of March and April \nreached values of 7.8 mm and 10.8 mm, respectively, whereas in May \nand June these values were raised to 195.8 mm and 115.4 mm, \nrespectively.  \n\nFigure 21. Score plot of PC1 versus PC2 considering for halogens in \nPM10 samples. Square on the right side (red) represents samples from \nrainy periods while the square on the left side (blue) represents the \nsamples from periods without rain. \n\nThe sample collected in March 06, 2013 was grouped together \nwith the samples collected during the rainy months, which results from \nan abnormally high rainfall that occurred the day before the collection. \nDespite the sample collected in February 06, 2013 has been collected \nduring the dry season it is not grouped together in this group, one \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n78?\n\n?\n\npossible explanation is based on the relative humidity of the previous \ndays, February 04 and 05 of 2013 (76% and 72 %, respectively), which \nwere higher than the dry days (69% in average) and lower than the rainy \ndays (79% in average) resulting in a different trend for this sample.  \n\nIn PC1 axis, the right side group shows that the concentrations \nof Cl, Br and I are predominant parameters. In the left side group, F \nconcentration is the predominant parameters. The concentrations of Cl, \nBr and I have been directly related to higher humidity conditions, \nwhereas an opposite behavior was observed for F. \n\n4.4. Conclusions \n\nDirect solid sample analysis using HR-CS-GF MAS for F \ndetermination and ETV-ICP-MS for Cl, Br and I determination in PM10 \nsamples have proven to be efficient and fast approaches and interesting \nalternatives to avoid the problems related to halogen determination and \nsample preparation. Monitoring of an analytical line in the visible region \nfor F determination via absorption of the CaF molecule provided \naccurate results with high sensitivity. \n\n The simultaneous determination of Cl, Br and I using SS-ETV-\nICP-MS was demonstrated for the first time and it was proven feasible, \naccurate and sensitive for halogen determination in airborne inhalable \nparticulate matter. Application of both methods to a set of PM10 samples \ncollected in a Northeastern coastal city in Brazil revealed that the \npresence of halogens correlates well to weather conditions, particularly \nto accumulated rainfall and relative air humidity. Higher relative air \nhumidity resulted in higher concentrations of Cl, Br and I, which are \nusually originated from marine sources, whereas the F is more \nabundantly present in periods with higher sunlight incidence.    \n\n\n\nChapter 5 - Direct solid sample analysis for Br \n\nquantification in polymers by LA-ICP-MS \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n81 \n\n?\n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nPlastic materials are widely used in our daily life, requiring \ndifferent properties for different applications, such as treatment with \nflame retardants. One technique to achieve flame retardance in polymers \nis based on scavenging of radicals formed during combustion, which is \nnormally achieved by adding halogenated compounds to the polymer as \nan additive [113 - 116]. \n\nBrominated compounds are preferred over other halogens, \nwhich is due to the fact that F presents high electronegativity, generating \nthermally stable compounds, Cl compounds are not easily degraded in \nnature and I is large enough to be easily dissociated from the compound \nit is bounded to. On the other hand, Br compounds are more \nbiodegradable in nature than Cl compounds. Bromine also dissociates \nreadily from organic molecules at high temperatures, forming a radical \nthat acts as scavenger [117]. \n\nAlthough there are advantages associated to the use of Br \ncompounds as flame retardants, its presence in the environment is \nconsidered hazardous and its inhalation may produce irritation and tissue \ndamage, in addition to other environmental effects such as the depletion \nof the ozone layer [23, 116-118]. \n\nIn this sense, monitoring of Br concentration in products that \nmay release the element to the atmosphere is considered important and \nthe use of ICP-MS is an attractive technique for this task due to the high \nsensitivity and wide linear calibration range [5]. However, a \nconventional analysis by ICP-MS normally requires sample \npretreatment, which is time consuming, requires additional equipments \nand promotes dilution of the sample, which leads to increased limit of \ndetection (LOD) and the possibility of contamination.  \n\nHalogen determination in polymers requires even more \ncomplex sample preparation setups, since extreme conditions of \ntemperature and pressure are required for the destruction of the sample \nmatrix without promoting analyte loss or contamination [114].  \n\nIn this sense, direct analysis brings the advantages of decreasing \nthe possibility of analyte loss and contamination.   \n\nDirect solid sample analysis (SS) by means of laser ablation \n(LA) or ETV, has shown to be an efficient strategy for Br determination \nby ICP-MS in different matrices. However, some drawbacks are still \npresent, such as difficulties associated to calibration and low precision \nof the results due to non-homogenous distribution of the analyte in the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n82 \n\n?\n\nsamples. Nonetheless, ID calibration has been successfully applied for \nBr quantification by LA-ICP-MS, whereas external calibration using \naqueous and solid standards may be successfully used in SS-ETV-ICP-\nMS for different matrices [69, 40, 64]. \n\nThus, the aim of this chapter is to evaluate the capability of \ndirect solid sampling analysis by LA-ICP-MS for Br analysis in \npolymeric samples, exploring simple and straightforward techniques for \ncalibration. \n\n5.2. Experimental  \n\n5.2.1. Instrumentation \n\nThe LA-ICP-MS experiments were carried out using a GeoLas \nArF excimer-based LA system (MicroLas, Germany), coupled to an \nElement XR single-collector sector field instrument (Thermo Scientific, \nGermany).  \n\nTable 13.

The ablation cell was coupled to the ICP-MS \ntorch via a 3-mm-internal-diameter Tygon tubing using Ar-He as the \ncarrier [119]. Helium was driven through the ablation cell to carry the \nanalytes and Ar was added to the gas stream leaving the cell using \nTeflon connection. The operating parameters of the LA-ICP-MS system \nare presented in Table 13. \n\n5.2.2. Samples, reagents and standards \n\nAll reagents used were at least analytical grade. Deionized \nwater was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, \nUSA) at a resistivity of 18.2 M? cm. Six CRMs and five \u2018real\u2019 samples \nobtained from the local markets of the city of Ghent in Belgium were \nused. The reference materials used were the polyethylene CRMs ERM-\nEC680, ERM-EC681 and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) ERM-\nEC591 obtained from the Institute for Reference Materials and \nMeasurements (IRMM, Geel, Belgium). The polyethylene CRMs PE, \nPE-H-11A and PEL-11A were supplied by Modern Analytical \nTechniques LLC (Hillsborough, USA). Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene \nresin CRM BAM was obtained from the Federal Institute for Materials \nResearch and Testing (Berlin, Germany). \n\n5.2.3. Analytical procedure \n\nThe samples were placed onto a plastic platform and inserted \ninto the ablation cell. The surfaces of the samples were cleaned prior to \nthe analysis by pre-ablation of the top layer using the optimized \nconditions and without measuring the signal. Sample ablation was \ncarried out using 300 laser pulses at a frequency of 15 Hz ranging the \nsamples surface. Integrated signals were used. \n\nQuantifications were carried out by external calibration using \nthe CRMs containing different concentrations of the analyte and also by \nexternal calibration using only one CRM and monitoring 12C as an \ninternal standard.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n84 \n\n?\n\n5.3. Results and discussion \n\n5.3.1. Optimization of the LA-ICP-MS parameters \n\nSensitivity is an issue for Br analysis by ICP-MS due to its high \nionization energy. Therefore, in order to obtain the maximum sensitivity \nof the method and to enable its application for trace Br analysis, the \noperating parameters of carrier gas flow, RF power of the ICP-MS, spot \nsize and pulse frequency of the laser were optimized using a \u2018real\u2019 \npolyethylene sample. \n\nThe use of He as a carrier gas promotes the formation of smaller \nparticles during the ablation of the sample when compared to Ar, \nincreasing the sample transport efficiency and also the process of \nionization in the plasma [119,120]. Thus, the He flow rate was \noptimized maintaining the Ar flow constant at 0.7 L min-1, as can be \nseen in Figure 22, the selected gas flow was 0.6 L min-1, although little \ninfluence on the signal intensity was associated to this parameter. As the \nAr flow is connected after the ablation cell, this parameter does not \naffect the ablation efficiency and vapor flush from the ablation cell thus \nthis parameter was not optimized. \n\nFigure 22.  Effect of carrier gas flow rate on the integrated signal for Br \nin polyethylene using LA-ICP-MS. Conditions: 950 W RF power, spot \nsize of 120 \u00b5m and 15 Hz laser pulse frequency. Normalized signal refer \nto the ratio between each individual signal and the highest signal. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n85 \n\n?\n\nThe results in Figure 23 demonstrate that the spot size plays an \nimportant role in the achieved sensitivity. The maximum spot size \nevaluated, 120 \u00b5m, provided the highest sensitivity. This is according to \nexpectations, since a smaller amount of sample is ablated with small \nspot sizes. Smaller spot sizes may also lead to inaccurate results due to \nvariations in the signal, an effect explained by the combination of \nfluence, mass ablation rate and crater aspect ratio reaching high depth \nand affecting the ablation efficiency [120, 121]. \n\nFigure 23. Effect of the spot size on the integrated signal for Br in \npolyethylene using LA-ICP-MS. Conditions: 950 W RF power, He \ncarrier gas flow of 0.6 L min-1 and 15 Hz laser pulse frequency. \nNormalized signal refer to the ratio between each individual signal and \nthe highest signal. \n\nThe repetition rate (Figure 24) and RF power (Figure 25) were \noptimized for maximum intensities, resulting in maximum signals at 15 \nHz and 950 W, respectively. Overlap of craters may be expected when \nusing high repetition rates and large spot sizes, which may promote the \nheating and melting of plastic samples, modifying the ablation \nefficiency. However, this effect was not observed in the present work, \nsince the signals were proven sufficiently stable throughout the analysis \ninterval.\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n86 \n\n?\n\nFigure 24.

Figures of merit and application \n\nCalibration using solid standards in ICP-MS may be very \nchallenging, mainly in the case of LA-ICP-MS where the interaction of \nthe laser with the sample may change depending on matrix composition. \nThis effect frequently leads to differences in the ablation efficiency of \nthe sample and particle formation, resulting in different sensitivities for \ndifferent matrices [122].  \n\nAs previously mentioned, two calibration strategies were \nevaluated in this work: 1 - External calibration using different CRMs as \nexternal standards and 2 - External calibration using a single CRM as \nexternal standard, in combination with internal standardization.  \n\n Figure 26 presents the calibration curve obtained using \ndifferent CRMs as external standards. As can be seen, a linear \ncorrelation was obtained, despite the differences in sample composition \nassociated to the CRMs. This suggests that the ablation efficiency is not \nstrongly affected by the polymer composition, at least not for the \ndifferent polymers studied in this work. \n\nFigure 26.  Bromine response in CRMs of polymers containing different \nconcentrations of Br using a LA-ICP-MS composed by a GeoLas ArF \nsystem and an Element-XR ICP-MS. RF power of 950 W, He carrier gas \nflow of 0.6 L min-1, Spot size of 120 \u00b5m and frequency of 15 Hz. \n\nThe use of external calibration with internal standization using a \nsingle CRM as an external standard requires the presence of one element \n(the internal standard) with known concentration in the samples and \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n88 \n\n?\n\nstandards, which behaves similarly to the analyte during the ablation, \ntransportation and ionization in the plasma [122]. In the case of \npolymers, it is possible to estimate the carbon concentration based on \nthe polymer composition. This approach prevents additional steps for \nquantification of the internal standard, thus simplifying the method. \n\nTable 14 presents the results obtained using the polyethylene \nCRM PE-H-11A as an external standard and monitoring the signal of \n12C+ as an internal standard. It is possible to observe that for all samples, \nexcept for one, the determined Br concentrations are in agreement with \nthe certified value. The exception is ERC-EC591, which is a \npolybrominated diphenyl ether sample. Estimation of the carbon content \nprior to the quantification of Br is more difficult which hinders the \naccurate quantitation of the analyte in this sample besides ablation \nefficiency may be different for this sample. \n\nTable 14.

The PE sample is namely bromine-free, which allow \nits use as a matrix blank. However, ten measurements of gas blank did \nnot show significant differences in signal intensity compared to the \nmeasurements of this sample; thus, the gas blank may be used as a \ntrustworthy blank. \n\nBromine was quantified in five commercial samples, 3 \npolypropylene and 2 polyethylene, by LA-ICP-MS using external \ncalibration using different CRMs as external standards and external \ncalibration using the sample CRM PE-L-11A and monitoring 12C+ as an \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n89 \n\n?\n\ninternal standard. The results are presented in Table 15, where it is \npossible to observe that, although accurate results (assuming that the \ncalibration against solid polymer standards is accurate) can be obtained, \nthe precision was deteriorated when 12C+ was used as an IS. This may be \nrelated to differences between the C and Br behavior during ablation, \naerosol transportation and ionization in the plasma. The concentration of \nBr in the \u2018real\u2019 samples ranged from 117 \u00b5g g-1 to 225  \u00b5g g-1. \n\nTable 15.

A common Br isotopic reference material \nis seawater, which has a fixed Br isotopic composition and is referred to \nas Standard Mean Ocean Bromide (SMOB). The isotopic composition \nof SMOB was determined by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry, \nalthough the most commonly used reference standard, NIST SRM 977 \nNaBr salt, was characterized by TIMS [50,51].  \n\nThe atomic weight of bromine was recently re-evaluated on the \nbasis of previously unknown natural isotope fractionation processes \n[123]. Bromine isotope fractionation has been reported in brines and \nsaline groundwater, as well as in artificially produced materials [124].  \n\nThe potential for bromine isotope fractionation induced by \nother natural processes, such as brine rejection during polar sea ice \nformation or autocatalytic processes such as \u201cbromine explosions\u201d, are \nyet to be investigated [125-128]. With the aim of investigating such \nprocesses, this chapter presents a simple method for the isotopic analysis \nof Br in seawater using MC-ICP-MS after minimal sample pre-\ntreatment.  \n\nIn contrast to the metallic elements normally analyzed for their \nisotopic composition using MC-ICP-MS, Br is a relatively volatile \n(when present as Br2 or as Br\n\n- in acidic medium) non-metal, with a high \nionization energy [129]. Isotopic analysis of Br using MC-ICP-MS in its \nstandard configuration (using PN for sample introduction) represents a \nchallenge for a number of reasons. \n\n The use of a nebulizer mounted onto a spray chamber for \nsample introduction in MC-ICP-MS may result in pronounced memory \neffects for Br, while the introduction of water and/or other solvents into \nthe central channel of the plasma is known to increase the risk of \nspectral interference [54, 57, 130].  \n\nIn order to avoid these problems related to Br isotopic analysis \nusing MC-ICP-MS in its standard configuration, alternative sample \nintroduction strategies have been proposed, including the insertion of Br \nas a gas into the ICP by oxidation of Br- into the volatile Br2 species \n[54],  photochemical vapor generation of Br (as CH3Br) [131] and the \ncoupling of gas chromatography to MC-ICP-MS [55], as well as the \ncombination of IC and aerosol desolvation (using NaHCO3/Na2CO3\nbuffer in order to avoid Br-losses in the desolvator system) as an online \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n94 \n\n?\n\nstrategy for Br MC-ICP-MS isotopic measurements in natural waters \n[132].   \n\nIn addition to the specific problems related to Br isotopic \nanalysis in MC-ICP-MS, the seawater matrix presents an additional \nchallenge as a result of the high concentrations of dissolved salts. Even \nafter dilution, the high salt content may lead to deposits on and damage \nto the cones, reducing the sensitivity and negatively affecting stability of \nthe measurements [133,134].  \n\nThe presence of high amounts of easily ionizable elements \n(such as Na, K and Ca) gives rise to non-spectral interference, while \nadditional polyatomic ions, such as 40Ar39K+ and 40Ar41K+ overlap with \nthe 79Br+ and 81Br+ analyte signals, respectively, at low mass resolution \n[135].  \n\nAlso correction for mass discrimination is more complicated in \nthe presence of a matrix, unless all samples and the external standard \nshow exactly the same matrix composition Therefore, matrix removal \nprior to isotopic analysis using MC-ICP-MS is strongly advised to avoid \nfurther instrumental and analytical problems. In order to separate the \nanalyte from the seawater matrix, several techniques, such as vapor \ngeneration and ion exchange chromatography [55,133,134,136], have \nbeen described in the literature. In this work, only column \nchromatography was considered.  \n\nThe aim of this work was to develop a simple and accurate \nmethodology for Br isotope ratio measurements in seawater using MC-\nICP-MS, with minimal sample pretreatment.  \n\n6.2. Experimental \n\n6.2.1. Instrumentation \n\nAll isotope ratio measurements were carried out using a Thermo \nScientific (Germany) Neptune MC-ICP-MS instrument, with a sample \nintroduction system consisting of a 100 \u00b5L min-1 PFA (Perfluoroalkoxy \nAlkane) nebulizer mounted onto a dual spray chamber, consisting of a \ncyclonic and a Scott-type sub-unit. Three combinations of cones and \ninterface pump were evaluated: (i) a standard interface pump and \nstandard cones, (ii) a jet interface pump and standard cones, and (iii) a \njet interface pump, jet sampling cone and X-type skimmer cone. \n\nThe measurements were performed using static collection with \nFaraday cups connected to 1011 ? amplifiers for monitoring the signal \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n95 \n\n?\n\nintensities for the internal standards and 1012 ? amplifiers for the Br \nisotopes. Gain calibration and baseline correction were performed before \neach measurement session. The operating parameters are summarized in \nTable 16. \n\nTable 16.

The nuclides monitored were 79Br, 35Cl, 23Na and 103Rh (as \ninternal standard).  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n96 \n\n?\n\n6.2.2. Reagents, standards and samples  \n\nAll reagents used were of analytical grade or better. Ultrapure \nwater (resistivity ?18.2 M? cm) was obtained from a Milli-Q Element \nwater purification system (Millipore, France). Pro-analysis purity grade \n14 mol L-1 HNO3 (ProLabo, Belgium) was further purified by sub-\nboiling distillation in PFA equipment. TraceSELECT\u00ae NH3 was \nobtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).  \n\nPolypropylene chromatographic columns (Eichrom, USA) filled \nwith 1 mL of a cation exchange resin were used for matrix removal. \nThree cationic resins were evaluated: Dowex\u00ae 50WX8 (200-400 mesh) \nand Dowex\u00ae 50WX8 (100-200 mesh) both from Sigma-Aldrich, and \nDowex\u00ae 50WX4 (200-400 mesh) from Alfa Aesar (USA). These resins \ndiffer from one another in particle size and/or degree of cross-linking.  \n\nNaBr isotopic standard reference material NIST SRM 977 and \nSr isotopic standard reference material NIST SRM 987 SrCO3 were \nsupplied by NIST (MD, USA). Individual 1,000 mg L-1 standard \nsolutions of Br, Cl, Ge, Na, Se and Rh were obtained from Inorganic \nVentures (the Netherlands). The standard solutions for Br, Cl, Na, Rh \nwere used for quantitative measurements, while Ge and Se were used as \ninternal standards for internal mass bias correction [123]; their isotopic \ncomposition was taken from reference [137].  \n\nSuprapur NH4Cl (Merck, Germany) was used as source of Cl \nfor matrix matching. The seawater CRM IRMM BCR-403 was used as \nan in-house Br isotope ratio standard, while NIST SRM 977 was used as \nBr isotopic reference material. \n\n6.2.3. Analytical procedure \n\nIn-house standards were prepared by dilution of a stock solution \nof NIST SRM 977 containing 200 mg L-1 of Br. The samples were \nprepared to final concentrations of Br between 1,000 \u00b5g L-1 and 4,000 \n\u00b5g L-1 in 5 mmol L-1 of NH3.  \n\nA chlorine matrix was simulated by addition of ultrapure NH4Cl \nto obtain final Cl concentrations ranging from 300 to 1000 mg L-1. The \nconcentration of the internal standard was adjusted so as to obtain a \nminimum signal intensity of 0.5 V for the minor of the two isotopes \nmonitored (86Sr ? 0.7 V, 87Sr ? 0.5 V for, 77Se ? 0.5 V, 78Se ? 1.5 V, \n72Ge ? 0.5 V and 74Ge ? 0.7V). \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n97 \n\n?\n\nA number of approaches to correct for instrumental mass \ndiscrimination were tested. Internal correction was employed using Sr, \nSe or Ge as an internal standard with the application of Russell\u2019s revised \nexponential law. External correction was applied using a sample-\nstandard bracketing approach (SSB) [138].  \n\nFor determination of the concentrations of Br and Cl using \nquadrupole-based ICP-MS, the calibration standards, blank solutions \nand samples were prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3 with the aim of \ndecreasing memory effects for these elements. For Na determination, all \nsolutions were prepared in 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3. All measurements were \ncarried out using 1 \u00b5g L-1 Rh as internal standard. \n\nThe preparation of the chromatographic columns was preceded \nby cleaning the polypropylene column with ultrapure water. \nSubsequently, the column was filled with 1 mL of resin (previously \nwashed with ultrapure water to remove soluble organic compounds). 2 \nmL of sample solution was loaded onto the column and the Br-fraction \nwas eluted with 2 mL of ultrapure water. The 2 mL of eluent leaving the \ncolumn during sample loading and the 2 mL of eluent leaving the \ncolumn during Br elution were collected in the same \npolytetrafluoroethylene vessel.  \n\nAn aliquot of NH3 was added to obtain a final concentration of \n5 mmol L-1 for water evaporation on a hot plate at 90 \u00b0C until a total \nvolume of about 1 mL was reached (about 5 hours of evaporation). No \nloss of bromine was observed during the evaporation process, as is \nshown in section 6.3.3. \n\n  \n6.3. Results and discussion \n\n6.3.1. Preliminary studies  \n\nThe occurrence of spectral interferences is one of the main \nfactors which hinder accurate isotope ratio measurements. In this work, \npseudo-high mass resolution (resolving power = 8,000) was used to free \nthe Br+ signals from spectral overlap, while maintaining a flat peak \nshoulder, enabling the high precision required for isotopic analysis to be \npreserved to the largest possible extent [135]. \n\nFigure 27 shows the spectral peaks for both Br isotopes after \noptimization of the instrument settings with the MC-ICP-MS instrument \nequipped with the standard interface pump and cones (Figure 27a), and \nwith a jet interface pump, jet sampling cone and X-type skimmer \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n98 \n\n?\n\n(Figure 27b), respectively. As the signal intensity with the jet interface \npump and standard cones was similar to that using the standard interface \npump (and standard cones), these results have not been shown in the \nfigure. Optimization of the RF power, nebulizer gas flow rate and torch \nposition were carried out aiming at higher signal intensity for Br+ and a \nlower one for the interfering ions. The settings of the focus quad and \ndispersion quad lenses were optimized daily to achieve the best plateau \nfor 81Br+.\n\nFigure 27. Spectral peaks observed at the m/z ratios of 79 and 81 for a \nsolution containing 2,000 \u00b5g L-1 of Br in high resolution mode using a \nThermo Neptune MC-ICP-MS instrument. (A) Standard interface pump \nand cones and (B) jet interface pump, jet sampler cone and X-type \nskimmer cone. \n\n  \nDespite the ca. 5-fold lower signal intensity obtained with the \n\nstandard cones, a better peak shape (Br+ plateau) was obtained than \nwhen using a jet sampling cone and X-type skimmer. Thus, all further \nBr isotope ratio measurements were carried out using standard cones. \nDue to the low sensitivity of ICP-MS for Br, especially at high mass \nresolution, the concentration of Br may have an important influence on \nthe accuracy and precision attainable. Hence, the use of standard \nsolutions containing from 1,000 \u00b5g L-1 to 4,000 \u00b5g L-1 of Br were \nevaluated (Figure 28).  \n\nThe signal intensity for these standard solutions ranged from \n0.08 V (1,000 \u00b5g L-1 Br) to 0.32 V (4,000 \u00b5g L-1 Br) with a standard \ninterface pump and standard cones. According to counting statistics, the \nprecision was slightly worse at 1,000 \u00b5g L-1 Br, whereas for\nconcentrations ?2,000 \u00b5g L-1 an acceptable precision (?0.003 % RSD \nfor n = 3) was obtained. In addition, after correction for instrumental \nmass discrimination, the experimentally determined isotope ratios \nmeasured were in agreement with the certified value. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n99 \n\n?\n\nFigure 28.

Several wash solutions \u2013 milli-Q water, 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3\nsolution and 5 mmol L-1 NH3 solution \u2013 were evaluated for their \ncapability to overcome this drawback and hence, to increase the sample \nthroughput.  \n\nThe results (Figure 29) demonstrated that the longest washout \ntime was required when using 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3 solution, while also a \nhigher background signal was observed. The best behavior was observed \nwhen using 5 mmol L-1 NH3 solution. Considering that among \u2018real\u2019 \nsamples there might be some variation in the pH value, 5 mmol L-1 of \nNH3 was added to all diluted samples prior to analysis in order to avoid \nan enhanced memory effect for Br at too low a pH value. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n100 \n\n?\n\nFigure 29.

Even though the level of interference is expected to be lower for Sr \nthan for the other candidate internal standards, the results using Sr as an \ninternal standard were accompanied with higher RSDs than the results \nobtained relying on another internal standard (Figure 30).  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n102 \n\n?\n\nFigure 30.

There is no significant deterioration in the \nprecision and accuracy when using external correction in a standard-\nsample bracketing approach only. \n\n6.3.3. Evaluation of resins \n\nIn order to avoid the adverse effects arising from the direct \nanalysis of seawater to the largest possible extent, IC was relied on to \nremove the bulk of the alkali and earth alkali cations prior to Br isotopic \nanalysis. As shown in Table 18, three variants of a cation exchange \nresin, differing from one another in particle size and/or degree of cross-\nlinking, were evaluated. Quantitative recovery of Br was easily achieved \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n103 \n\n?\n\nwith all resins as Br- shows no affinity towards the resin, such that on-\ncolumn isotope fractionation did not occur.  \n\nTable 18.

The maximum tolerable sample \nvolume was determined to be 2 mL. \n\nThe Br concentration in seawater is expected to be higher than \n4,000 \u00b5g L-1 [139]. 2 mL of seawater sample was loaded onto the \ncolumn and a total of 4 mL column eluent was collected. The resulting \n2-fold dilution did not negatively affect the precision attainable, but to \nextend the application range to samples with a lower Br concentration, a \npre-concentration step by means of evaporation was included in the \nsample pre-treatment. \n\n For evaluating this approach, standard solutions containing \n1,000 \u00b5g L-1 of Br were reduced in volume from 4 mL to ?1 mL; the \nfinal volume was subsequently adjusted to 1 mL with Milli-Q water. \nThe Br recovery obtained for standard solutions prepared in HNO3 was \n77 \u00b1 5 % and the 81Br/79Br isotope ratio was 0.97284 \u00b1 0.00008; for \nwater-based standards, the recovery was 97 \u00b1 9 % and the 81Br/79Br ratio \nwas 0.97293 \u00b1 0.00005, whereas for standards prepared in 5 mmol L-1\n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n104 \n\n?\n\nNH3, a recovery of 98 \u00b1 5 % and a \n81Br/79Br ratio of 0.97293 \u00b1 0.00002 \n\nwere found. These ratios all compare favorably to the isotope ratio \nobtained for the standard after dilution only (0.97291 \u00b1 0.00002). \n\nFigure 31. Effect of sample and standard Cl concentration on 81Br/79Br \nmeasurement results obtained using MC-ICP-MS (external correction in \na SSB approach for correction for instrumental mass discrimination, \nn=3, mean \u00b1 SD). \n\nThe presence of chlorine in post-column solutions may also \nlead to non-spectral effects [140]. Figure 31 presents the effect of Cl \n(added as NH4Cl) on the \n\n81Br/79Br isotope ratio measurement results, \ncorrected for instrumental mass discrimination using external correction \nin a sample-standard bracketing approach. \n\n It can be concluded from these results that matrix matching for \nCl is necessary in order to achieve accurate 81Br/79Br ratio \nmeasurements, since a lower 81Br/79Br ratio than expected was obtained \nusing samples containing higher Cl concentrations than the standards. \nOn the other hand, when using standards containing higher Cl \nconcentrations than the samples, the 81Br/79Br ratio was biased high. The \nsame trend was observed using internal correction with an internal \nstandard. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n105 \n\n?\n\n6.3.4.

The Br isotope ratio results were \nexpressed as ?81Br = [(Rsample-Rstandard)/Rstandard] x 1000, in which the \nstandard is SMOB (Standard Mean Ocean Bromine) [5]. Although the \nprecision of the ?81Br (SMOB) values calculated for the samples \ncontaining Cl was slightly affected by the Cl concentration, the results \nobtained for both, Br isotopic reference material NIST SRM 977 and \nseawater reference material (Table 19), are in accordance with the \nliterature values [55,141]. \n\nTable 19.

Introduction \n\nThe 37Cl/35Cl isotope ratio is considered a useful diagnostic \nparameter for geochemical processes in seawater, sea ice and the \natmosphere [142-143]. However, high-precision isotopic analysis of \nCl still is an analytical challenge. \n\nSeveral techniques have been deployed for the measurement \nof the Cl isotope ratio, including electron impact ionization mass \nspectrometry [144], IRMS [145], NCIMS [49] and more recently \nHR-CS MAS [52]. Unfortunately, these techniques are characterized \nby a number of drawbacks, such as the need for time-consuming \nsample preparation procedures, the occurrence of memory effects \nand/or a poor precision. \n\nPTIMS relying on the monitoring of the polyatomic Cs2Cl\n+ \n\nion, and IRMS are normally employed for Cl isotopic analysis and \nthey have been applied to the measurement of the Cl isotope ratio in \ndifferent samples, however, mass fractionation which is dependent of \nthe Cl concentration was observed in the case of PTIMS [146-148]. \n\nThe application of MC-ICP-MS to Cl isotopic analysis is far \nfrom trivial, mainly due to i) the low sensitivity, resulting from the \nhigh ionization potential of Cl (12.967 V), ii) the occurrence of \nspectral interference, mainly due to the formation of polyatomic ions \ncontaining elements, such as H, O, S and/or Ar \u2013 e.g., 16O18O1H+ and \n34S1H+, the signals of which overlap with that of 35Cl+, and 36Ar1H+, \nthe signal of which overlaps with that of 37Cl+, iii) memory effects \nand iv) potential contamination from samples in HCl medium, \nroutinely analyzed with this instrumentation [148-149]. \n\nThe introduction of the target element Cl as a dry vapor has \nshown to be an efficient strategy to avoid or at least strongly reduce \nthe level of spectral interference for Cl determination and isotopic \nanalysis by ICP-MS, as it allows the separation of Cl from the matrix \nof the sample. In addition, the introduction of a dry aerosol using \nvapor generation, laser ablation (LA), ET), GC or a dessolvator \nsystem may improve the sensitivity due to the enhancement of the \nsample introduction efficiency [131, 148-150].  \n\nDespite the fact that vapor generation has improved the \ncapabilities for Cl determination and isotopic analysis via ICP-MS, \nthe overall procedure is laborious and requires specific equipment \nand reagents, which on occasions prevents the use of an autosampler. \nThe use of a wet plasma and sample introduction via conventional \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n????\n\n?\n\nPN allows a simpler measurement protocol, use of the standard \nautosampler and an increased sample throughput with the standard \nMC-ICP-MS configuration [151].\n\nMost of the current literature on isotopic standards for Cl \npresents the data as the ?37Cl value, calculated relative to Standard \nMean Ocean Chloride (SMOC). However, it was reported that ?37Cl \nmay range from -0.07 (Miyajima, Japan) to +0.08 (Woods Hole, US) \n\u2030 in seawater, depending on the geographical provenance of the \nsample [142]. In igneous rocks, a variation in ?37Cl (always relative \nto SMOC) from -0.85 to +0.25 was reported [132], for different \ncommercially available inorganic standards, ?37Cl values from -2.24 \n\u2030 (for KCl) to 0.92 \u2030 (for HCl) were reported and for organic \nsolvents from -5.01 \u2030 (for 1,1,1-Trichloroethane) to +2.85 \u2030 (for \n1,1-dichloroethene) [146]. \n\nThe NaCl isotopic standards SRM 975 and SRM 975a, both \nfrom NIST (USA), and ISL-354, from the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA, Austria) were used for evaluating the \naccuracy of the measurements. Those standards were accurately \ncharacterized in terms of their Cl isotopic composition by Wei, et al. \n[147], who reported 37Cl/35Cl isotope ratios of 0.319876 \u00b1 0.000067 \nfor NIST SRM 975, of 0.319768 \u00b1 0.000187 for NIST SRM 975a, \nand of 0.319549 \u00b1 0.000044 for ISL-354. The ?37Cl values \n(expressed relative to SMOC) compiled by Brand et al. in an IUPAC \nTechnical Report were +0.43 \u2030 for NIST SRM 975, +0.2 \u2030 for \nNIST SRM 975a and +0.05  \u2030 for ISL-354 [152]. \n\nThe aim of the present work was to assess the feasibility of \ntraditional MC-ICP-MS (wet plasma conditions &amp; use of PN for \nsample introduction) for high-precision isotopic analysis of Cl by \nadequately addressing the problems of spectral interference, low \nsensitivity and memory effects. After method optimization ?37Cl was \ndetermined for a number of commercially available standards. \n\n7.2. Experimental  \n\n7.2.1. Instrumentation \n\nAll isotope ratio measurements were carried out using a \nThermo Scientific (Germany) Neptune MC-ICP-MS instrument, with \na sample introduction system consisting of a 100 \u00b5L min-1 PFA \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n?\n\n111 \n\n?\n\nnebulizer mounted onto a dual spray chamber, consisting of a \ncyclonic and a Scott-type sub-unit. \n\nThe measurements were performed using static collection \nwith Faraday cups connected to 1012 ? amplifiers. Gain calibration \nand baseline correction were performed before each measurement \nsession. The operating parameters are summarized in Table 20. \n\nQuantification of Cl and Na were carried out using a \nquadrupole-based Elan DRCPlus ICP-MS unit (Perkin Elmer, CT, \nUSA). The nuclides monitored were 35Cl, 23Na and 103Rh (as internal \nstandard).  \n\nTable 20.

Reagents, standards and samples  \n\nAll reagents used were of analytical grade or higher purity. \nUltrapure water (resistivity ? 18.2 M? cm) was obtained from a \nMilli-Q Element water purification system (Millipore, France). Pro-\n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n????\n\n?\n\nanalysis purity grade 14 mol L-1 HNO3 (ProLabo, Belgium) was \nfurther purified by sub-boiling distillation in PFA equipment. \nTraceSELECT\u00ae NH3 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). \n\nPolypropylene chromatographic columns (Eichrom, USA) \nfilled with 1 mL of Dowex\u00ae 50WX8 (200-400 mesh) cation \nexchange resin were used for matrix removal. Chlorine isotope \nmeasurements were carried out for NIST SRM 975a NaCl isotopic \nreference material (MD, USA), BCR CRM 579 reference material \n(mercury in coastal sea water) from the Institute for Reference \nMaterials and Measurements of the European Commission (IRMM, \nBelgium) and in commercially available extra pure NaCl (batch # \nK04243400), pro analysis KCl (batch # K36308936641) and \nSuprapur NH4Cl (batch # B363143), all of which supplied by Merck \n(Germany). NH4SO4 was obtained from Merck (Suprapur purity). \nIndividual 1,000 mg L-1 standard solutions of Cl, Na and Rh \n(Inorganic Ventures, the Netherlands) were used in the context of \nelemental assay via quadrupole-based ICP-MS. \n\n7.2.3. Analytical procedure \n\nEach sample or standard was prepared by loading a \npolypropylene chromatographic column filled with 1 mL of Dowex\u00ae\n\n50WX8 cation exchange resin (previously washed with ultrapure \nwater to remove soluble organic compounds) with 1 mL of solution \ncontaining 1,000 mg L-1 of Cl. The Cl-fraction (Cl- shows no affinity \ntowards the resin) was eluted with 2 mL of milli-Q water and this \nfraction was diluted to a final volume of 10 mL.  \n\nThe Cl concentration, as well as the residual (post-column) \nNa concentration were determined using quadrupole-based ICP-MS \nafter addition of Rh (final concentration of 1 \u00b5g L-1) as an internal \nstandard. Chlorine quantification was carried out via external \ncalibration (calibration curve). Standard, blank and sample solutions \nwere prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3 in order to decrease memory \neffects. Sodium determination was carried out using solutions \nprepared in 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3.  \n\nChlorine isotope ratio measurements were performed in \ndiluted samples with a Cl concentration of 100 mg L-1 (samples and \nstandards were all prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3). In-between every \ntwo solutions, the sample introduction system was rinsed with 5 \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n?\n\n113 \n\n?\n\nmmol L-1 NH3 solution during 3 min. The mass bias was corrected \nfor using external correction in a SSB approach. \n\n7.3. Results and discussion \n\n7.3.1. Spectral interferences \n\nChlorine isotope ratio measurements with MC-ICP-MS may \nsuffer from severe spectral interference, depending on the \ncomposition of the sample, the analyte element concentration, the \nsample introduction system selected and the mass resolution used. \n\nAfter proper optimization of the instrument settings, a mass \nresolving power 10,000 (defined as R = m/?m, with ?m the \ndifference between the masses where the analyte intensity amounts \nto 95% and 5% of the maximum signal intensity, respectively) was \nachieved. A resolving power corresponds to a mass resolution \n(R=m/?m with ?m the full peak width at 5% of its maximum peak \nheight) of approximately 5,000 [135].  \n\nThe theoretical resolution required to resolve the analyte \nsignal from that of the polyatomic ion, interfering at low mass \nresolution, at the m/z ratio of 35Cl+ is about 1,000 for 16O18O1H+ and \n5,100 for 34S1H+ (assuming equal intensities for analyte and \ninterfering signal). At the m/z ratio of 37Cl+, a resolution of about \n3,900 is required for resolving the analyte signal from that of 36Ar1H+ \n\n(assuming equal intensities for analyte and interfering signal).  \n\nThe calculations of the resolutions required were done based \non the atomic masses as provided by the Commission on Isotopic \nAbundances and Atomic Weights from the International Union of \nPure and Applied Chemistry [153].  \n\nThe major cation load of seawater can be removed easily via \nthe use of a cation exchange resin [149]. However, anions containing \nS (such as S04\n\n2-) are self-evidently not expected to be removed using \nthis approach, leading to the formation of 34S1H+ in the plasma. Cl \ncan be isolated from other matrix compounds by alternative or \nadditional approaches, such as precipitation using Ag+ [6], vapor \ngeneration and the use of high performance liquid chromatography \nor gas chromatography [132]. However, these approaches add \ncomplexity to the procedure; therefore, it was decided to rely on the \npseudo-high resolution mode to resolve this interference.  \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n????\n\n?\n\nAlthough sulfur is present in seawater, no signal for the \n34S1H+ polyatomic ion was observed for a seawater sample after \nsubmitting it to cation exchange chromatography, which is due to the \nlow concentration of S compared to Cl\u2013  in seawater, for which the \n[SO4\n\n2-]/[Cl1-] ratio is, on average, 0.14 [139].  \n\nFigure 32. Mass spectra recorded at an m/z  ratio of 35 (a) and of 37 (b) \nusing MC-ICP-MS with sample introduction via conventional PN at \npseudo high resolution (resolving power of approximately 10,000) for a \nstandard solution containing 1 mg L-1 of Cl and 500 mg L-1 of S. \n\nIn order to promote the formation of 34S1H+ and thus, to \nidentify the exact positions of the signals of the analyte and \ninterfering ions, the spectral peaks at m/z ratios of 35 and 37 (Figure \n32) were recorded for a standard solution containing 1 mg L-1 of Cl \nand 500 mg L-1 of S. As can be seen in Figure 32, it is possible to \nidentify a narrow mass window in the lower mass range (left side) of \nthe signal in both figures in which the signal derives solely from Cl. \nHence, the final measurements (static mode) were performed in these \nnarrow mass windows with regular monitoring for mass shift. \nAdditionally, due to the use of wet plasma conditions, it is possible \nto observe a significant contribution of polyatomic ions containing O \nand H to the signal measured at an m/z ratio of 35 and containing Ar \nand H at an m/z ratio of 37. \n\n7.3.2. Memory effect \n\nCl isotope ratio measurement via pneumatic nebulization \n(PN)-MC-ICP-MS is hindered by pronounced memory effects, \nwhich may also significantly affect isotope ratio measurements. \nSeveral wash solutions were studied in terms of washout behavior. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n?\n\n115 \n\n?\n\nRapid reduction of the Cl signal intensity back to background levels \nis desirable when using external correction in a sample-standard \nbracketing correction for mass bias [132, 151]. Three different wash \nsolutions were evaluated: 0.14 mol L-1 HNO3, ultrapure water (as \nobtained from a Milli-Q system) and 5 mmol L-1 NH3. The standards \nwere also prepared in the corresponding medium. \n\nFigure 33. Transient signals recorded for 35 Cl using conventional \nnebulization and MC-ICP-MS with aspiration of different wash \nsolutions between successive injections of a 100 mg L-1 Cl standard.  \nThe standard solutions were prepared in the same medium. \n\nFigure 33 presents the effect of these three different wash \nsolutions on the remaining signal after measuring a standard \ncontaining 100 mg L-1 of Cl and made up in the same medium. \nUnder acidic conditions, the formation of HCl is favorable, which is \nnot easily washed out due to vapor formation and retention of the \nvapor formed inside the spray chamber.  \n\n7.3.3. Chlorine concentration and mass bias correction \n\nDue to its high ionization potential, the sensitivity \ndemonstrated by ICP-MS for Cl is low when compared to other \nelements, an effect that is more pronounced using pneumatic \nnebulization due its low sample introduction efficiency when \ncompared to vapor generation [131,149]. Therefore, establishing the \nminimum concentration required for Cl isotope measurement is a \ncritical factor. Figure 34 presents the difference in accuracy and \nprecision observed at different Cl concentrations. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n????\n\n?\n\nUnder the conditions adopted in this work, the Cl isotope \nratio could be measured with good accuracy and precision (37Cl/35Cl \n= 0.319765 \u00b1 0.000022 for NIST SRM 975a, RSD ~ 0.007% for n = \n3) at a Cl concentration of ? 70 mg L-1. \n\nA high concentration of Cl is required due its low ionization \nefficiency, which is estimated according to the Saha equation to be \napproximately 0.9%, while for the majority of the elements \ncommonly determined by ICP-MS, this value is higher than 90% \n[67], such that a Cl concentration approximately 100-fold higher \nthan typical for other elements is required. \n\nFigure 34. Effect of Cl concentration on the Cl isotope ratio as \nmeasured using MC-ICP-MS (wet plasma conditions) in a solution of \nNIST SRM 975a NaCl (mass bias corrected for by external correction in \na sample-standard bracketing approach, n=3).\n\nThe relatively high concentration of Cl required for high-\nquality isotope ratio measurements via PN-MC-ICP-MS, is not \nproblematic as the concentration of Cl in the natural sources of \ninterest, such as seawater, is normally >> 100 mg L-1 [151].  \n\nMass bias correction was applied by external correction \nusing an SSB approach. To obtain the best performance using this \ncorrection method, it is important that both, standard and sample \nsolutions are matrix- and concentration-matched and the time \ninterval between the measurement of two successive solutions \n(standard and sample or sample and standard) should not be too long. \nIn this work, the major cation load of the samples was removed via \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n?\n\n117 \n\n?\n\ncation exchange chromatography and pronounced Cl memory effects \nwere avoided by using 5 mmol L-1 NH3 as wash solution. Under \nthese conditions, the time interval between the analyses of two \nsolutions was limited to 3 min and external correction was proven \nfeasible. \n\n7.3.4. Sample preparation and method accuracy \n\nSample preparation was carried out by loading 1 mL of \nsample solution (e.g., seawater) into a polypropylene \nchromatographic column filled with 1 mL of Dowex\u00ae 50WX8 cation \nexchange resin and eluting the analyte fraction with 2 mL of milli-Q \nwater. The resulting solution was then diluted to a final concentration \nof 100 mg L-1 of Cl in 5 mmol L-1 NH3. This approach allowed \nefficient removal of the major cation load \u2013 as confirmed by the \nabsence of Na (&lt;LOD = 0.1 \u00b5g L-1) in the post-column solution.  \nAbsence of Cl isotope fractionation was demonstrated by the results \nfor ?37Cl in NH4Cl, analyzed before and after passage through the \ncation exchange column (Table 21).  \n\nThis comes as no surprise as Cl- is not expected to show any \naffinity towards the chromatographic resin. The results (Table 21) \nobtained for the seawater sample (BCR CRM 579) and for NIST \nSRM 975a were in good agreement with the values reported in the \nliterature.  \n\nA variation in ?37Cl from -0.07 to +0.08\u2030 has been reported \nfor seawater; the reference value reported in Table 21 is the average \n\nTable 21.

These differences may be attributed to differences in the \nproduction process of the reagents or in the source of the salts. \n\n7.4. Conclusions \n\nDespite the occurrence of spectral interference, memory \neffects and the characteristic low sensitivity, isotopic analysis of Cl \nin seawater can be successfully performed using PN-MC-ICP-MS \n(wet plasma conditions). High mass resolution,  the use of 5 mmol L-\n1 NH3 as a wash solution and a minimum Cl concentration of 70 mg \nL-1 were required to achieve accurate and precise results. The method \nis applicable to seawater samples and to saline solutions, after a \nsimple chromatographic cleanup step. The proposed procedure is \nsimpler and faster than other methods typically deployed for Cl \nisotopic analysis.  \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Quantification of bromine and chlorine and \n\nisotope ratio measurements in Antarctic sea ice \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n121 \n\n?\n\n8.1. Introduction \n\nThe increasing temperature in Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans \nhas been linked to the so-called global warming, which is considered to \nbe a consequence of several human activities such as land-clearing, \nfossil-fuel burning, industrial activities and increasing the concentration \nof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [154-155].  \n\nOne of the consequences from the increasing temperature is the \ndecrease of the sea ice extension; this effect has been more notorious in \nthe Arctic Ice and less clear in the Antartic due to its isolation by big \namounts of cold water [156-157].  \n\nDue to its whiteness, the surface of the sea ice normally reflects \nthe sunlight back to space. When the sea ice surface is reduced, the \nsunlight focuses on the seawater, increasing the temperature of the \noceans. As a consequence, the raise in atmospheric temperature is \nintensified [158]. \n\nHalogens may play an important role in global warming events \nwhen present in the environment due to a series of factors, such as \ndestruction of the ozone layer through catalytic reactions, affecting the \npartitioning of HOx and NOx, oxidizing dimethyl sulphide and affecting \nthe oxidation of volatile organic compounds, among others [118,125]. \nNevertheless, the halogens have demonstrated great potential as proxies \nof polar ice extent and are related in concentration to sea water [125-\n128, 139].  \n\nConsidering the importance of the sea ice towards a series of \nenvironmental phenomena such as influence in the polar albedo, oceanic \ncirculation and the atmosphere-ocean transfer of heat, salts and gases \n[158], it is of vital importance to understand the mechanisms and \ntimescales by which the sea ice interacts with other components of the \nEarth\u2019s climate system, in order to be able to accurately predict both the \nnature and rate of future climate change.  However, the understanding of \nEarth\u2019s climate system demands accurate and well-resolved records of \nsea ice extent and rates of change obtained from an independent and \nreliable sea ice proxy, but existing sea ice proxies suffer from \nlimitations. \n\nMethanesulphonic acid, a product of ocean algae emissions, \ncorrelates with satellite observations of sea ice extent off the East \nAntarctic coast, but is reactive and remobilized in ice cores over \ncentennial time scales [159]. Another example is related to Na in ice \ncores, that reflects glacial-interglacial sea ice variability, but on shorter \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n122 \n\n?\n\ntimescales is strongly influenced by meteorology as well as competing \nsea ice and open ocean emission sources. Diatom biomarkers recorded \nin Southern Ocean sediments are a specific proxy of sea ice extent, but \nsuffer from low temporal and spatial resolution and are not preserved in \nsome regions. Bromine and Cl determined in polar ice cores offer a \nnovel solution to these limitations [158, 125-128].\n\nGiven the lack of studies on isotope ratio of halogens in sea ice \nand the importance associated to well resolved records of sea ice for the \nbetter understanding of the environmental phenomena which contributes \nto the sea ice melting and formation, the aim of this work is to evaluate \nthe halogen isotope ratio in Antartic sea ice from different locations and \ndifferent collection depths in order to evaluate their behavior in those \nsamples. \n\n8.2. Experimental \n\n8.2.1. Instrumentation \n\nThe isotope ratio measurements were carried out using a \nThermo Scientific (Germany) Neptune MC-ICP-MS instrument, with a \nsample introduction system consisting of a 100 \u00b5L min-1 PFA nebulizer \nmounted onto a dual spray chamber, consisting of a cyclonic and a \nScott-type sub-unit. The measurements were performed using static \ncollection with Faraday cups connected to 1012 ? amplifiers. Gain \ncalibration and baseline correction were performed before each \nmeasurement session. The operating parameters are summarized in \nTable 22. \n\nQuantification of Br, Cl and Na was carried out using a \nquadrupole-based Elan DRCPlus ICP-MS unit (Perkin Elmer, CT, \nUSA). The nuclides monitored were 79Br, 35Cl, 23Na and 103Rh (as \ninternal standard).  \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n123 \n\n?\n\nTable 22.

Reagents, standards and samples  \n\nAll reagents used were of analytical grade or higher purity. \nUltrapure water (resistivity ? 18.2 M? cm) was obtained from a \nMilli-Q Element water purification system (Millipore, France). Pro-\nanalysis purity grade 14 mol L-1 HNO3 (ProLabo, Belgium) was \nfurther purified by sub-boiling distillation in PFA equipment. \nTraceSELECT\u00ae NH3 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). \n\nPolypropylene chromatographic columns (Eichrom, USA) \nfilled with 1 mL of Dowex\u00ae 50WX8 (200-400 mesh) cation \nexchange resin were used for matrix removal. Chlorine and Br \nisotope measurements were carried out using a NIST SRM 975a \nNaCl and a NIST SRM 977 NaBr isotopic reference materials (MD, \nUSA), respectively. These materials were used for mass bias \ncorrection and to check the method accuracy. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n124 \n\n?\n\nIndividual 1,000 mg L-1 standard solutions of Br, Cl, Na, and \nRh were obtained from Inorganic Ventures (the Netherlands). \nSuprapur\u00ae NH4SO4 was obtained from Merck. \n\nThe certified seawater reference material BCR CRM 579 \n(mercury in coastal sea water), from the Institute for Reference \nMaterials and Measurements of the European Commission (IRMM, \nBelgium), was used. \n\n8.2.3. Analytical procedure \n\nEach sample or standard was prepared by loading up to 2 mL \nof sample into a polypropylene chromatographic column filled with \n1 mL of Dowex\u00ae 50WX8 cation exchange resin (previously washed \nwith ultrapure water to remove soluble organic compounds), eluting \nwith 2 mL of deionized water and diluting to a final volume of 10 \nmL.  \n\nThe Br and Cl concentration, as well as the residual (post-\ncolumn) Na concentration were determined using quadrupole-based \nICP-MS after addition of Rh (final concentration of 1 \u00b5g L-1) as an \ninternal standard.  Quantification was carried out via external \ncalibration (calibration curve). Standard, blank and sample solutions \nwere prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3 in order to decrease memory \neffects. Sodium determination was carried out using solutions \nprepared in 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3.  \n\nBromine isotope ratio measurements were performed in \ndiluted samples with a Br concentration of 3,000 \u00b5g L-1, whereas Cl \nisotope ratio measurements were performed in diluted samples with a \nCl concentration of 100 mg L-1 (samples and standards were all \nprepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3). A preconcentration step consisting of \nan evaporation on a hot plate at 90 \u00b0C for about 5 hours was carried \nout for the samples that presented Br concentration lower than 3,000 \n\u00b5g L-1. No preconcentration step was required for Cl isotope ratio \nmeasurements. \n\nIn-between every two solutions, the sample introduction \nsystem was rinsed with a 5 mmol L-1 NH3 solution for 3 min. The \nmass bias was corrected for using external correction in a SSB \napproach, matching the Cl concentration in the standards with the \nsamples for Br isotope ratio measurements. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n125 \n\n?\n\nAll measurements were performed using high resolution \nmode, measuring in the narrow mass window where the signal \ncontribution is solely from Br or Cl isotopes. In order to promote the \nformation of 34S1H+ and then, to identify the narrow mass window \nfor Cl isotopes, the optimization of this parameter was performed \nusing a solution containing 1 mg L-1 of Cl and 500 mg L-1 of S. \n\nThe values were calculated as ?X = [(Rsample-\nRstandard)/Rstandard] x 1000, where X= \n\n81Br or 37Cl, using as a standard \nthe certified reference sea water BCR CRM 579. \n\n8.2.4. Collection of samples \n\nThe samples were carefully collected in order to prevent \ncontamination. The involved personnel was equipped with clean room \ngarments (Tyvek overall, overshoes and polyethylene gloves) over their \nwarm clothes, and items dedicated to sample collection and storage were \ncleaned and sealed in plastic bags. \n\nFigure 35. Locations of the ice stations visited during the SIPEX-2 \nexpedition and sample collection. \n\n Contamination-free samples were collected using the \nequipment designed by Lannuzel, et al (2006) [160] in different depths \ncodified from si1 (top of the sea ice) to si6 (bottom of the sea ice). After \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n126 \n\n?\n\nsample collection, the ice cores were triple bagged and stored at -18oC \nuntil processing in the laboratory for analysis. \n\nThe collection of the samples was performed during the \nAustralian-led Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment-2 (SIPEX-2) \nmarine expedition in 2012 (26 Sep\u201310 Nov), geographical location is \n64\u201365oS/116\u2013121oE, presented in Figure 35. Three local sea water and \nice samples were collected for comparison proposes.\n\n8.3. Results and discussion \n\n8.3.1. Concentration of Br and Cl in sea ice \n\nThe total concentration of Br and Cl was measured in the sea \nice samples after the cation load removal through a cationic column.  \n\nChlorine and Br concentrations in the sea ice presented a linear \ncorrelation, with a slope of 0.0037 and a correlation coefficient of \n0.9896 (Figure 36). The determined slope is similar to the slope obtained \nby Morris, et al. (0.0035), which is considered as a signature of seawater \nand thus no bromine explosion effect could be observed from the sea ice \nmeasurements in this work. The concentration of Br in sea ice ranged \nfrom 700 to 31000 \u00b5g L-1 and for Cl from 200 mg L-1 to 8000 mg L-1. \nThe variation in concentration was related to the depth of the sea ice \ncollected; the more deep the sea ice was collected the lower the Cl and \nBr concentrations were. This finding might be related to desalination \neffect.  \n\nThe desalination process in sea ice (which is responsible for \ndecreasing the concentration of elements in the sea ice when compared \nto seawater) is linked to gravity drainage and flushing [162]. The gravity \ndrainage is explained as equilibrium of the salinity gradient in the \ninterstitial brine that follows the temperature gradient in sea ice. With \nthe cooling of ice from above during the winter, the brine density of the \nsea ice becomes unstable, maintaining the highest densities at the top of \nthe ice, which may explain the results obtained in terms of \nconcentration, as presented in Figure 36. However, depending on the \npermeability of the sea ice, a convective overturning of brine within the \nmushy ice may occur. The flushing effect is, however, explained as a \nsort of \u201cwash out\u201d of salty brine with fresh meltwater during summer, \nwith the pressure over the meltwater working as the force to move \ndownwards and to elute brine out [161-162].   \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n127 \n\n?\n\nIn Figure 36 it is possible to observe a wide and linear range of \nconcentrations of Br and Cl in the sea ice collected, suggesting that the \ndesalination process acts similarly for both elements.  \n\nFigure 36. Relation between Br and Cl concentrations, measured by \nICP-MS, in the collected sea ice during the SIPEX-2 expedition.\n\nMost of the sea ice collected, specifically stations 2, 6, 7 and 8 \nis composed of granular sea ice (Figure 37) and columnar sea ice formed \nby sea water, supporting the idea that the decrease in the concentration is \ndue to desalination from frozen sea water since only a small amount of \nsea ice is composed of snow. \n\n The condition under which the sea ice was formed plays an \nimportant role to determine its structure. Frazil-ice crystals with granular \ntexture are normally linked to the rapid freezing of the ocean surface \nwhile ice pancakes are usually formed under turbulent conditions. After \nthe cover is formed, the ice starts to grow from the base to the surface, \nleading to the formation of crystals with elongated columnar texture. \n\nThe formation of the sea ice in this work probably occurred by \nfreezing seawater onto the underside of existing sea ice, tending to form \ncolumnar and granular ice. Only a small fraction of the sea ice studied \nhere was composed by compacted snow as can be seen in Figure 37. \n\n0\n\n10000\n\n20000\n\n30000\n\n40000\n\n0 2500 5000 7500 10000\n\nB\nr\n (\n\nm\ng\n L\n\n-1\n)\n\nCl (mg L-1)\n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n128 \n\n?\n\nFigure 37.  Observed texture of the sea ice collected during the SIPEX-\n2 expedition. \n\n8.3.2. Isotopic composition of Br and Cl in sea ice \n\nAll samples were analyzed regarding their Br and Cl isotope \nratios. Figure 38 presents the results of the measurements. A trend is \nvisible for both Br and Cl in the sea ice collected. It is possible to \nobserve that fractionation is more pronounced in deepest samples, which \nmay be explained by the fact that the deep sea ice is older than the top \nsea ice, being exposed to desalination more severely than the top sea ice. \nIn this case, there is the possibility that during the sea ice formation and \ndesalination the processes of gravity drainage and flushing promoted the \nfractionation of Br and Cl with approximately the same intensity for \nboth elements, since their concentrations are also related. \n\nIt is also possible to notice in Figure 38 that the stations 4 and 7 \ndo not present such a strong fractionation in the bottom of the sea ice as \nother stations. It is possible that, for these stations, there is a mixing of \nthe composition of the sea ice (top and bottom sea ice) and therefore the \nhomogenization of its composition.  \n\nMoreover, the ? values determined in seawater samples were in \nagreement with the ?  values reported in the literature for seawater \n(about 0), demonstrating that no fractionation takes place in seawater. \nThe determined ? values in the standards were in agreement with the \ncertified values (approximately -0.7 for ?81Br and 0.2 for ?37Cl), \nattesting the accuracy of the method. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n129 \n\n?\n\nFigure 38. ?\n81Br  and ?37Cl values from the sea ice collected during the \n\nSIPEX-2 voyage, measurements were carried out by MC-ICP-MS. std= \nStandards SRM 975a NaCl and a NIST SRM 977 NaBr, st means \nstations from 2 to 8, si means depth from 1 to 6.  Water 1 to 3 and ICE 1 \nto 3 are local water and ICE collected for comparison. All the ? values \nwere calculates based on the sea water BCR CRM 579.\n\nDue to the processes that the sea ice undergoes for its \nformation, including desalination, it is possible that (linked to the \ndecrease of the Br and Cl concentration) some fractionation effects \noccur, mainly due to the low temperature of the medium and the relative \nlow mass of these elements [161].  \n\nApparently, the process of desalination also plays a role in the \nisotope ratio of halogens due to differences in isotope migrations in the \nsea ice. Figure 39 presents the Br and Cl isotopic composition of the \ncollected sea ice regarding the concentrations measured. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n130 \n\n?\n\nFigure 39. Relation between the Cl and Br concentrations and their \nisotope ratio in the sea ice collected during the SIPEX-2 expedition.  \n\nFigure 40 presents the relationship between the determined Br \nand Cl isotope ratio values. This may support the idea that both elements \nrespond to the environmental processes at the same rate, and also that \nbromine explosion effects do not seem to play a role in their isotope \ncomposition, since variations in isotope composition are observed as a \ntrend for both elements. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n131 \n\n?\n\nFigure 40. Relation between ?81Br and ?37Cl values from the sea ice \ncollected during the SIPEX-2.\n\n8.4. Conclusions \n\nDifferences in Br and Cl concentration in sea ice were \nobserved. There is a general descending trend in the concentration of the \nhalogens at greater depths for sea ice samples. The decrease in the \nconcentrations of Br and Cl is probably related to the desalination \nprocess associated to sea ice formation, which also promoted the \nfractionation of their isotopes with a similar trend. The behavior of both \nelements is, somehow, linked.\n\n\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\n\nFinal Considerations \n\n133 \n\n?\n\n9. Final considerations \n\nDespite challenging, the use of SS-ETV-ICP-MS has proven to \nbe a feasible approach for halogen determination in different matrices, \nwith the potential of decreasing the amount of interferences and \nallowing calibration using aqueous standards to be carried out. \n\nThe LOQs obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-MS were in general \nimproved over those obtained by other approaches for halogen \ndetermination by ICP-MS, mainly due to the fact that no sample dilution \nis needed and to the high sample introduction efficiency of the ETV-\nICP-MS. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this technique for \nhalogen analysis in different samples thus the methods can applied for \nreal cases ranging from biological to environmental studies unrevealing \nthe chemistry of halogens which has not been studied due to the \nlimitation of measuring its concentration at low levels. \n\nMoreover, the use of slurry and liquid samples may be studied \napplying ETV-ICP-MS, which may improve the sample throughput and \ndispense the use of special apparatus for sample introduction into the \nETV. \n\nLA-ICP-MS for direct solid sampling analysis, which is \ncurrently commercially available, has demonstrated to be a feasible \ntechnique for Br analysis in polymers, allowing its quantification by \ndifferent straightforward approaches as the use of a single certified \nstandard monitoring 12C+  \n\nHalogen isotope analysis by MC-ICP-MS using conventional \nsample introduction systems also demonstrated to be a feasible and \nsimple approach, eliminating the need for coupling with other \ntechniques, such as gas chromatography or vapor generation, increasing \nthe sample throughput and simplifying the procedure for analysis. The \ndeveloped methods allowed accurate and precise isotope ratio \nmeasurements of Br and Cl and high sample throughput. \n\nThe developed methods were applied for real environmental \ncases, helping to understand environmental phenomena as well as the \ninvestigation of possible contamination sources. \n\n\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\n\nReferences \n\n135?\n\n?\n\n10.
