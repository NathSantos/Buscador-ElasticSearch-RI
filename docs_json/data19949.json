Este trabalho \u00e9 parte do projeto \nFIRECNUTS (PTDC/AGR-CFL/104559/2008) - efeitos de um inc\u00eandio \nnas reservas de nutrientes, din\u00e2mica e exporta\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 e lida com estas \nlacunas de pesquisa, estudando a exporta\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes \nselecionados (cati\u00f5es, azoto e f\u00f3sforo) numa \u00e1rea florestal recentemente \nqueimada, no centro-norte de Portugal (Sever do Vouga). Os objetivos \nespec\u00edficos foram comparar as exporta\u00e7\u00f5es de  cati\u00f5es, assim como de \nazoto e f\u00f3sforo nas formas totais e sol\u00faveis, principalmente \u00e0 escala de \nmicro-parcela: (i) para duas das esp\u00e9cies de \u00e1rvores mais propensas ao \nfogo, i.e. eucalipto e pinheiro; (ii) para duas das geologias mais comuns \nna \u00e1rea, i.e. granito e xisto; (iii) para diferentes orienta\u00e7\u00f5es do declive, \ni.e. face a norte e face a sul; (iv) com tempo-desde-inc\u00eandio durante os \nmeses iniciais ap\u00f3s inc\u00eandio e durante um per\u00edodo de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o \nmais extenso. As exporta\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes foram particularmente \nacentuadas nos tr\u00eas meses ap\u00f3s o fogo. No entanto, ap\u00f3s este per\u00edodo \ninicial, foram observados tamb\u00e9m picos nas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de \nnutrientes, em associa\u00e7\u00e3o a eventos de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o intensa, com \ndiferen\u00e7as na varia\u00e7\u00e3o de cada nutriente, e com o decl\u00ednio das \nexporta\u00e7\u00f5es de f\u00f3sforo a seguir um padr\u00e3o mais linear com o tempo \ndesde o inc\u00eandio. Os resultados deste estudo enfatizaram a import\u00e2ncia \nde uma camada protetora do solo (ou seja, com as agulhas das \u00e1rvores \nqueimadas de pinheiro) para minimizar a exporta\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes p\u00f3s-\nfogo. A geologia tamb\u00e9m foi identificada como uma vari\u00e1vel importante \nna avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de riscos de eros\u00e3o p\u00f3s-inc\u00eandio e na defini\u00e7\u00e3o de \nmedidas de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do solo. A orienta\u00e7\u00e3o do declive n\u00e3o foi uma \nvari\u00e1vel decisiva neste estudo. Estes resultados mostram tamb\u00e9m que \nas escalas de tempo mais amplas s\u00e3o \u00fateis para obter mais \nconhecimento sobre o ciclo hidrol\u00f3gico dos nutrientes e os complexos \nprocessos que ocorrem nas \u00e1reas de floresta queimada. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nWildfires, Mediterranean Basin, water erosion, overland flow, base \ncations loss, nitrogen loss, phosphorus loss, vegetation, geology, slope \naspect, micro-plot and slope scale. \n\n \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe aim of this work was to perform an evaluation of post-fire nutrient \nlosses by overland flow at micro-plot scale, and at slope scale (although \non a limited basis) in a recently burnt Mediterranean area, providing \nestimates of the range of base cations, nitrogen and phosphorus exports \nin a fire-prone landscape. It represents an important add-on to the up to \nnow modest number of studies on post-fire nutrient losses by overland \nflow conducted in the Mediterranean region, for anticipating the impacts \nof recurrent fires on soil productivity. This work is part of the FIRECNUTS \nproject (PTDC/AGR-CFL/104559/2008) - WildFIRE effects on topsoil \nCarbon and NUTrient Stocks, dynamics and exports \u2013 and addresses \nthese research gaps by studying the export of selected nutrients (base \ncations, nitrogen and phosphorus) in a recently burnt forest area in north-\ncentral Portugal (Sever do Vouga).The specific objectives were to \ncompare base cations exports together with nitrogen and phosphorus \nexports in the total and soluble forms by overland flow mainly at the \nmicro-plot scale: (i) for the two predominant and fire-prone forest types in \nnorth-central Portugal, i.e. eucalypt and pine plantations; (ii) for the two \nprevailing parent materials in the region, i.e. granite and schist; (iii) for \ntwo different slope aspects, i.e. a slope facing north and a slope facing \nsouth; (iv) with time-since-fire during the initial months of the window-of-\ndisturbance and for an extended monitoring period. In parallel, nitrogen \nand phosphorus stocks in the topsoil were also compared. Nutrient \nexports were particularly pronounced in the three months after fire. \nHowever, after this initial period, peaks in nutrients concentrations were \nalso observed in association to intense rainfall events, with differences in \nthe variation of each nutrient, with phosphorus exports decline following \na more straightforward pattern with time since fire. The results of this \nstudy emphasized the importance of a protective soil layer (i.e. of \nscorched pine needle) for minimizing post-fire nutrient export. Parent \nmaterial was also found to be an important variable when assessing \npost-fire erosion risks and defining soil conservation measures. Slope \naspect was not a decisive variable in his study. These results also show \nthat broader time scales are useful to gain insight into the hydrological \nand nutrient cycle complex processes in burnt forest areas. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\ni \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nChapter 1 -

Fire is now recognised worldwide \n\nas a natural phenomenon in Mediterranean regions but present-day fire regimes strongly \n\nreflect human activities such as the widespread planting of highly flammable pine and \n\neucalypt forests (Lloret, 2004). \n\nThroughout the past decades, wildfires have burned and affected increasingly large \n\nareas of land in Mediterranean ecosystems (Pausas et al., 2008). That trend is expected to \n\ncontinue, especially with projections of future climate changes with temperature rising and \n\nassociated risk of intensified drought or more intense precipitation events, among other \n\nfactors (Blake et al., 2010; Caon et al., 2014). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n\n(IPCC) report concluded that global climate change will increase the risk of extreme fire \n\nevents (IPCC, 2007). This tendency emphasizes the general reservations about the limits to \n\nthe fire resilience of these ecosystems that have been continually devastated by fire over the \n\npast decades (Pausas et al., 1999; Pausas et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2006b; Shakesby, 2011). \n\nIn Portugal, over the past decades, wildfires have devastated on average around \n\n100 000 ha of land each year (Pereira et al., 2006a), with dramatically higher figures for dry \n\nyears like 2003 and 2005. Due to the nature of the country\u2019s forestry activities as well as to a \n\nlikely increase in fire-propitious meteorological conditions, fire frequency in Portugal is not \n\nexpected to decrease in the foreseeable future (Pereira et al., 2006b). Such unprecedented \n\nfrequencies and spatial extensions of wildfires have contributed to the increase of interest in \n\nstudying wildfire effects.  \n\n1.2 Brief summary of fire effects on soil and water resources \n\nFire can considerably alter soils and their major ecological functions as the basis of many \n\necosystems resources. A global rise of fire occurrence, area burned or expansion of fire \n\nseasons has been acknowledged and many of the responses of soils to fire are as unique as \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n2 \n\nthe complex interactions among driver factors such as weather conditions during and \n\nfollowing fire, type and growth of vegetation, soil characteristics or land management (Blake \n\net al., 2010). \n\nWhile wildfire is a natural disturbance, the more frequent occurrence of wildfires, often \n\nwith high-intensity, can offset the ecological balance and have a significant negative impact \n\non soil degradation, biological diversity and water cycle (Caon et al., 2014; Crouch et al., \n\n2006). Wildfires have been considered as a significant, if not the main, cause of hydrological \n\nand geomorphological change in fire-prone landscapes (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006).  \n\nVegetation and litter cover removal as well as soil physical and chemical alterations are \n\nusually designated as direct hydrological and geomorphological effects from wildfires. These \n\nchanges are followed by indirect effects, such as reduced infiltration and increased sediment \n\navailability for transport. Finally, these effects will lead to an increase of overland flow \n\ngeneration and soil erosion (Figure 1.1; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). This marked increase in \n\noverland flow and erosion not only cause on-site land degradation but can also cause \n\nincreased sediment and nutrient inputs into adjacent streams or rivers, that can negatively \n\naffect the water quality in downstream aquatic systems, with potential contamination of \n\ndrinking water supplies (Bowman and Boggs, 2006; Emelko et al., 2011; Shakesby, 2011; \n\nSmith et al., 2011). \n\nBase cations, nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in forest soils \n\necosystems that can be significantly impacted by fire events. The combustion of litter and the \n\nsurface horizons of soils frequently produces nutrient-rich erodible ash, organic matter and \n\nmineral material, that can be an increase in soil fertility, facilitating crop production, or it can \n\ndestroy the protective vegetation canopy and forest floor, leading to a reduced infiltration \n\ncapacity and potential transport of nutrient-enriched sediments from burnt slopes, by wind \n\nand water erosion (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Shakesby, 2011).  \n\nNeary et al. (2005), Shakesby and Doerr (2006), Ferreira et al. (2008), Shakesby (2011) \n\nand Caon et al. (2014) have recently gathered aspects of the principles and processes \n\ngoverning the complex relationships between fire and soil. Previous studies in the \n\nMediterranean region (e.g. Cerd\u00e0 and Lasanta, 2005; Cerd\u00e0 and Robichaud, 2009; Ferreira et \n\nal., 2005a; Prats et al., 2012; Shakesby et al., 1996), have revealed strong and occasionally \n\nextreme responses in runoff generation and associated soil and nutrient losses following \n\nwildfire, in particular during the earlier stages of the so-called \u2018\u2018window-of-disturbance\u2019\u2019 \n\n(Figure 1.1; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). \n\nThis model represents a simplification of the sediment yield response to post-fire \n\nhydrological and geomorphological changes. Conversely, the role of each fire induced change \n\nto the post-fire hydrological and erosive response is still not entirely understood. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.1 - The \u2018\u2018window-of-disturbance\u2019\u2019 after wildfire, with the hypothetical decline in sediment \n\nyield and the role of three erosion-limiting factors: vegetation cover, litter cover, and stone lag \n\ndevelopment (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). \n\n \n\nIn most cases, the first 4\u20136 months period after a fire present frequently bigger \n\nsusceptibility to erosion because the lack of a protective litter and vegetation cover (Andreu \n\net al., 2001; Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Ferreira et al., 2005a; Thomas et al., 1999) promotes overland \n\nflow and erosion, but also because of the exhaustion of the nutrient-enriched ash layer (Caon \n\net al., 2014; Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2008; Khanna et al., 1994; Knoepp et al., 2005; Pausas et al., \n\n2008; Pereira et al., 2011; Shakesby, 2011; Thomas et al., 1999) and due to the maximum fire \n\npotential in summer (July\u2013August), as a result of higher temperatures and rainfall deficit \n\nduring this season, and the possibility of intense post-wildfire rainfall the following autumn\u2013\n\nwinter (November\u2013January) (Andreu et al., 2001; Ferreira et al., 2005a). \n\nA number of factors raise some concerns about the occurrence of wildfires in the \n\nMediterranean basin, mainly because of the above mentioned direct and indirect effects. \n\nWildfire frequency, severity and the size of burned areas, as well as the strong influence of \n\nhuman activities impact through land management practices, land-use changes such as land \n\nabandonment and widespread introduction of fire-prone species are viewed as drivers of the \n\nincrease of the wildfire activity (Moreira et al., 2009; Shakesby 2011). \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n4 \n\nIn Portugal, the number and severity of wildfires is not expected to decline in the future, \n\nas a result of the economic importance of the country\u2019s forestry activities using highly \n\nflammable species and the foreseeable raise in the occurrence of meteorological conditions \n\nfavorable to fire (Carvalho et al., 2010; Moreira et al., 2009; Pereira et al., 2006b). Strong and \n\nsometimes extreme increases in runoff generation and the associated losses of sediments \n\nhave also been observed for eucalypt and pine plantations, the two principal fire-prone forest \n\ntypes in north-central Portugal (Ferreira et al., 2005a; Prats et al., 2012; Shakesby et al., \n\n1996). \n\nPost-fire land management operations with heavy machinery (e.g. plowing; logging), \n\nleads to forest soil disturbances and have been acknowledged as an important cause for \n\nelevated soil erosion rates in some post-fire studies in the Mediterranean region (Shakesby et \n\nal., 1994; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2004; Shakesby, 2011; Martins et al., 2013). An increase of the \n\nnumber of wildfires and recurrence at the same area, alongside the impacts of these generally \n\nused practices can be one of the major pressures to Mediterranean soils (Shakesby, 2011). \n\nAccording to Shakesby (2011), post-fire soil losses in the Mediterranean are very \n\nimportant, although sediment losses are considered low when compared to other regions, \n\nbecause of the frequent presence in this region of shallow soils with a history of intense \n\ndisturbances, in a nutrient-poor environment. More important than the quantity, or in any \n\ncase on the same level of importance, the quality of the material that is being lost during post-\n\nwildfire erosion should be faced as a key focus of interest in this line of research (Shakesby, \n\n2011). Minor post-fire soil losses could be significant for soil longevity in some areas, on \n\naccount of soil organic matter and nutrient losses in solution or adsorbed onto eroded \n\nsediment particles (e.g. Kutiel and Naveh, 1987). The combination of high fire frequency and \n\nshallow soils in a nutrient-poor environment, characteristic of many fire-prone \n\nMediterranean areas, increases the risk of soil fertility depletion (Pausas and Vallejo, 1999).  \n\n1.3 Research on post-fire nutrient mobilization in the Mediterranean region: soil \n\nand overland flow  \n\nSince the 1990s, when research activity into post-wildfire soil erosion in the \n\nMediterranean region expanded (Shakesby, 2011), following the beginning of the dramatic \n\nincrease in fire activity (Moreno et al., 1998; Pausas, 2004), several studies in this region have \n\naddressed the present-day hydrological response and erosion rates for areas affected by \n\nforest fires (e.g. Cammeraat and Imeson, 1999; Doerr et al., 2000; Ferreira et al., 2005b; \n\nImeson et al., 1992; Shakesby et al., 1993, 1996, 2002), and soil nutrients dynamics after fire \n\n(e.g. Andreu et al., 1996; Gimeno-Garc\u00eda et al., 2000; Pardini et al., 2003; Rodr\u00edguez et al., \n\n2009). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n5 \n\n \n\nComparability among studies can be challenging due to several factors as fire behaviour \n\nand recurrence, precipitation regimes during the post-fire period, fire-induced changes \n\naccording to different fire severity, and ecosystems specific features mixtures. Only a few \n\nstudies in the Mediterranean have deal with fire-induced alterations on nutrient transport \n\ncarried on by hydrological and erosion processes changes (e.g. Cancelo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013; \n\nDeBano et al., 1998; D\u00edaz-Fierros et al., 1990; Lasanta and Cerd\u00e0, 2005; Machado et al., 2015). \n\nIn Portugal, a small number of studies using experimental plots were performed focusing on \n\nthese changes occurring in nutrient output by overland flow, and most of these only \n\nevaluated solute form losses (Coelho et al., 2004; Ferreira et al., 1997, 2005a; Thomas et al., \n\n1999, 2000a, 2000b; Walsh et al., 1992). \n\nTherefore, in spite of concerning the same land-cover types and having similarities in \n\nclimate and type of soil, most of these studies presented results of different parameters, \n\npredominantly in the dissolved form, obtained by different methodologies. It is known that \n\nnutrients within ash on the soil surface (resultant of burning of litter and vegetation) are \n\nsusceptible to both solution and physical erosion processes, increasing the potential for \n\nexport of nutrients in both dissolved and particulate form (Lane et al. 2008), with particulate \n\nbeing the dominant form of loss (Sharpley et al. 1992). \n\nRegardless of being generally recognized, there is less information currently available on \n\nthe potential downstream environmental consequences of enhanced nutrient losses \n\nfollowing wildfire in relation to impacts on water quality, which are intrinsically linked to \n\npost-fire hydrological and soil erosion processes (Blake et al., 2010). Hence, a better \n\nunderstanding of post-fire nutrient behaviour, in both dissolved and particulate forms, allows \n\na more accurately interpretation of the evolution of nutrient losses and its effects on \n\nvegetation recovery, soil productivity and downstream water quality. This knowledge gap is \n\nbeing addressed by the present work.  \n\nThe present work is part of the FIRECNUTS project (PTDC/AGR-CFL/104559/2008) - \n\nWildFIRE effects on topsoil Carbon and NUTrient Stocks, dynamics and exports \u2013  that \n\naddresses these research gaps by studying the export of organic carbon and selected key \n\nnutrients (base cations, nitrogen and phosphorus) in a recently burnt forest area in north-\n\ncentral Portugal (Sever do Vouga). \n\n1.4 Aims of the present work \n\nThe general objective of this thesis is to contribute to deepen and broden the knowledge \n\non the hydrological and erosion response focusing on the nutrient cycle complex processes in \n\nrecently burnt forest areas and understand the ecological consequences of these processes.  \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n6 \n\n \n\nTherefore, this thesis work pretends to gain insight into the magnitude of post-fire soil \n\nfertility losses in the Mediterranean region, which is crucial information for defining post-fire \n\nland management measures to reduce soil degradation. \n\nFor that matter, key nutrient exports (base cations, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus \n\nexports in the total and soluble forms: total nitrogen and nitrate; total phosphorus and \n\nortophosphate) by overland flow were evaluated in a recently burnt forest area. This \n\nevaluation was done mainly at the micro-plot scale and on a limited basis at the slope scale \n\n(presented here only in one of the chapters). \n\n \n\nThe specific objectives were:  \n\n(i) to assess post-fire stocks of key nutrients in the topsoil and ash layer. \n\n(ii) to describe the temporal variation in topsoil nutrient stocks and distribution \n\nfollowing wildfire and post-fire management. \n\n(iii) to quantify the post-fire nutrient losses by overland flow (under the influence of \n\ndifferent features): \n\n\u2022 for the two predominant and fire-prone forest types in north-central Portugal, \n\ni.e. eucalypt and pine plantations;  \n\n\u2022 for the two prevailing parent materials in the region, i.e. granite and schist);  \n\n\u2022 for two different slope aspects, i.e. a facing-north slope and a facing-south slope;  \n\n\u2022 with time-since-fire during the initial months of the window-of-disturbance and \n\nfor an somewhat extended monitoring period.  \n\n(iv) to describe the temporal variation in key nutrient losses following wildfire and post-\n\nfire management. \n\n(v) to establish the relationships between post-fire key nutrient losses and hydrological \n\nand erosion processes. \n\n \n\nSite differences in soil nutrient dynamics are expected given the different features in \n\nterms of types of forest plantations, parent materials and slope aspects, as well as the shallow \n\nsoil on this study area that brings the parent material close to the plant root zone (Yavitt, \n\n2000). \n\n1.5 Outline of this thesis work \n\nThis document starts with this Chapter 1, presenting the motivation and importance of \n\nthis work, the outline of this thesis and a brief introduction to wildfire effects on soil nutrient \n\nstocks and exports by overland flow. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n7 \n\n \n\nThe organization of this thesis follows four main chapters, Chapters 2 to 5, in which \n\nthese objectives were set. These chapters correspond to papers published or submitted for \n\npublication and stands by itself. These papers have been organized to cope with the \n\nobjectives of this work, thus providing the framework for the rest of this thesis. \n\nChapter 2 present a short-term study on base cations losses in contrasting slopes in \n\nterms of vegetation (eucalypt vs. pine) and parent material (granite vs. schist), during a \n\nlimited selection of major rainfall events over the six-months monitoring period. It presents \n\nalso a comparison between micro-plot scale and slope scale, with comparison to an unburnt \n\nslope only at the slope scale. \n\nChapters 3 and 4 are based on the same study sites of Chapter 2, at the same contrasting \n\nslopes in terms of vegetation (eucalypt vs. pine) and parent material (granite vs. schist), \n\npresenting short-term nutrient losses for all the rainfall events over the six-months \n\nmonitoring period, at the micro-plot scale. Chapter 3 presents results for nitrogen losses, \n\nwhile Chapter 4 deals with  phosphorus losses. \n\nTo cope with the limitations of short-term studies, Chapter 5 presents a variation of \n\nnitrogen and phosphorus losses for all the rainfall events over an extended monitoring \n\nperiod, in contrasting slopes in terms of slope aspect. This was done in recently burnt \n\neucalypt plantations, at the micro-plot scale, over a twenty-months monitoring period. \n\nChapter 6 provides the conclusions of the present work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAndreu, V., Imeson, A.C., Rubio, J.L., 2001.

Besides soil particles themselves, soil cations can be lost by fire-enhanced \n\noverland flow, increasing the risk of fertility loss of the typically shallow and nutrient poor \n\nMediterranean soils. Although the importance of cations for land-use sustainability is widely \n\nrecognised, cation losses by post-fire runoff have received little research attention. The \n\npresent study aimed to address this research gap by assessing total exports of Na+, K+, Ca2+ \n\nand Mg2+ in a recently burnt forest area in north-central Portugal. These exports were \n\ncompared for two types of planted forest (eucalypt vs. maritime pine plantations), two types \n\nof parent materials (schist vs. granite) and for two spatial scales (micro-plot vs. hill slope). \n\nThe study sites were a eucalypt plantation on granite (BEG), a eucalypt plantation on schist \n\n(BES) and a maritime pine plantation on schist (BPS). Overland flow samples were collected \n\nduring the first six months after the wildfire. Cation losses differed strikingly between the \n\ntwo forest types on schist, being higher at the eucalypt than pine site. This difference was \n\nevident at both spatial scales, and probably due to the extensive cover of a needle cast from \n\nthe scorched pine crowns. The role of parent material in cation export was less \n\nstraightforward as it varied with spatial scale. Cation losses were higher for the eucalypt \n\nplantation on schist than for that on granite at the micro-plot scale, whereas the reverse was \n\nobserved at the hill slope scale. Finally, cation yields were higher at the micro-plot than slope \n\nscale, in agreement with the general notion of scaling-effect in runoff generation. \n\nKeywords \n\nWildfires, Base Cations, Overland Flow, Water Erosion, Mediterranean Basin \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n14 \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nIn Portugal, like in other Mediterranean countries, wildfires are now widely accepted to \n\nbe a natural phenomenon. However, fire frequency and intensity are considered to have \n\nincreased dramatically since the 1960s (Pereira et al., 2006; Shakesby, 2011). As principal \n\ncauses of this intensified fire regime have been appointed a combination of socio-economic \n\nfactors, in particular the large-scale planting of fire-prone tree species such as eucalypt and \n\npine, and the extensive abandonment of traditional land-use practices (Moreira et al., 2009; \n\nShakesby et al., 2011).  \n\nThe increase in fire occurrence is a matter of concern for the (semi-)natural ecosystems \n\nin the Mediterranean Basin because it exerts both immediate and lasting environmental and \n\necological impacts (Certini, 2005; Shakesby, 2011). Most of these impacts are directly or \n\nindirectly related to changes in the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils, which \n\naffect biogeochemical cycles, and may therefore increase the risk of soil degradation (Certini, \n\n2005; Knoepp et al., 2005; Shakesby, 2011; Soto et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 2000a, 2000b).  \n\nDuring fires, macro-nutrients (N and P) and base cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) \n\ncontained in plant biomass and in the litter and soil organic layers may be lost through \n\nvolatilization, convection (of ash and smoke), or particulate transport (Knoepp et al., 2005; \n\nNeary et al., 1999; Soto et al., 1997; Wanthongchai et al., 2008). After a fire, the elements \n\ndeposited as ash or mineralized from burnt organic matter on the soil surface are often \n\nleached into the soil or lost by wind and water erosion (Caon et al., 2014; Knoepp et al., 2005; \n\nNeary et al., 1999; Soto et al., 1997; Wanthongchai et al., 2008). \n\nCation losses by hydrological processes are strongly affected by fire-induced changes in \n\nsoil cover due to the (partial) combustion of vegetation and litter layer (Certini, 2005; \n\nFerreira et al., 2005; Granged et al., 2011; Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992; Shakesby, 2011; Zavala et \n\nal., 2010). The increase in bare soil, which is known to enhance the erosive potential of rain \n\ndrops (Certini, 2005; Fernandez-Raga et al., 2010), and the removal of vegetation and litter, \n\npromotes overland flow and the associated sediment losses (Ferreira et al., 2005, 2008; \n\nGranged et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2014; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). Fire-induced changes in \n\ntopsoil properties such as, infiltration capacity (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Moody et al., 2013; \n\nShakesby, 2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006), porosity (Granged et al., 2011), soil water \n\nrepellency (Doerr et al., 2006; Keizer et al., 2008; Malvar et al., 2011), organic matter (Bad\u00eda \n\net al., 2014; Knoepp et al., 2005) and aggregate stability (Varela et al., 2010), can further \n\nenhance overland flow and losses in soil and soil fertility. The first rainfall events after a \n\nwildfire are often of major importance in terms of cation depletion (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; \n\nKnoepp et al., 2005; Shakesby, 2011). \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n15 \n\nThe magnitude of post-fire cation losses is extremely variable, depending on a complex \n\ninterplay of factors such as type and growth stage of the vegetation, fire behaviour and \n\nseverity, local fire history, antecedent weather conditions, and site characteristics (Brais et \n\nal., 2000; Caon et al., 2014; Certini, 2005; Knoepp et al., 2005; Neary et al., 1999; Shakesby \n\nand Doerr, 2006). The temperature reached in soils during burning is particularly important \n\nfor the direct fire effects on soil fertility (Caon et al., 2014; Certini, 2005). Low-intensity \n\nwildfires are usually associated with an increase, albeit ephemeral, in soil cation availability \n\n(Brais et al., 2000; Scharenbroch et al., 2012) whereas moderate- and high-intensity fires \n\ngenerally produce base cation losses (Certini, 2005; Shakesby, 2011). \n\nThe effects of fire on soil nutrient dynamics in forest areas have been addressed by \n\nvarious studies (Caon et al., 2014; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2007; Kutiel and \n\nShaviv, 1992; Trabaud, 1994; Wanthongchai et al., 2008; Yildiz et al., 2010). However, post-\n\nfire export of base cations by overland flow has received little research attention; in spite the \n\nfew-existing studies clearly suggested its relevance for soil productivity (Cancelo-Gonz\u00e1lez et \n\nal., 2013; Ferreira et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 1999, 2000b). Especially in the fire-prone \n\nregions of the Mediterranean Basin with their typically shallow and nutrient poor soils, fire-\n\nenhanced cation exports are particularly relevant for land-use sustainability (Ferreira et al., \n\n2005, 2008; Shakesby, 2011). \n\nIn Portugal, post-fire cation export by runoff was studied by Thomas et al. (1999, 2000b) \n\nand Ferreira et al. (2005). These three studies assessed the losses for the two principal forest \n\ntypes in the study region - plantations of eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and maritime \n\npine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) - at different spatial scales ranging from micro-plot to catchment. \n\nHowever, Thomas et al. (1999, 2000b) and Ferreira et al. (2005) measured the losses of \n\ndissolved or exchangeable cations rather than the total losses, and, thus, most likely \n\nunderestimated the full impacts of wildfires on soil fertility.  \n\nTo address this research gap, the present study aimed at providing further insights into \n\ntotal cation exports by post-fire overland flow in recently burnt Mediterranean forests. To \n\nthis end, total losses of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in post-fire runoff were quantified: i) for two \n\ncontrasting spatial scales, i.e. that of micro-plot and hill slope; ii) for two contrasting forest \n\ntypes, i.e. the eucalypt and maritime pine plantations that are now dominating the north-\n\ncentral Portuguese mountains; and iii) for two contrasting bedrock types, i.e. schist and \n\ngranite that are both widespread in north-central Portugal. These base cation losses by \n\noverland flow were furthermore compared with the stocks in the ash and uppermost soil \n\nlayers, both immediately after the wildfire and at the end of this study as well as with the \n\nlosses under long-unburnt conditions, albeit only at the slope scale and just for a eucalypt \n\nplantation. As post-fire hydrological and geomorphological activity in the study region is \n\nparticularly intense during the early stages of the so-called \u201cwindow of disturbance\u201d (Ferreira \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n16 \n\net al., 2005, 2008; Malvar et al., 2011; Martins et al., 2013; Prats et al., 2014; Shakesby, 2011;  \n\nShakesby and Doerr, 2006), base cation losses were monitored  during the first six months \n\nafter a wildfire. Plans to continue the monitoring scheme had to be abandoned as the recently \n\nburnt study sites were terraced in preparation for a new eucalypt plantation. \n\n2.2 Material and Methods \n\n2.2.1 Study area and study sites \n\nThe study area was located within the Vouga River Basin, near the Ermida village in the \n\nSever do Vouga municipality, Aveiro District, north-central Portugal (Figure 2.1). At the end \n\nof July 2010, a wildfire ravaged the area for two days and consumed almost 295 ha of forest \n\nlands (DUDF, 2011). The \u201cErmida\u201d burnt area was predominantly covered by eucalypt \n\nplantations but also included a few, small maritime pine stands. The fire severity was, on \n\noverall, moderate, since the litter layer and undergrowth vegetation of herbs and shrubs \n\nwere mostly completely consumed, whereas the tree crowns were typically only partially \n\ncombusted (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). Within the burnt area, three hill slopes were selected \n\nfor this study for their moderate fire severity and, at the same time, contrasting forest types \n\nas well as parent materials (Table 2.1). The BEG study site concerned an eucalypt plantation \n\non granite, the BES site an eucalypt plantation on schist and the BPS site a maritime pine \n\nslope on schist (Figure 2.1.). In addition, a long-unburnt (more than 20 years) eucalypt \n\nplantation on schist (UES) was selected just outside the burnt area, whilst a long-unburnt \n\nMaritme Pine site could not be located within reasonable distance (Figure 2.1.). \n\nThe climate of the study area can be classified as humid meso-thermal, with moderate \n\nbut prolonged warm dry summers (K\u00f6ppen: Csb; DRA-Centro, 2002). Mean annual \n\ntemperature at the nearest climate station (Castelo Burg\u00e3es: 40\u00ba 51\u2019 10\u2019\u2019N, 8\u00ba 22\u2019 44\u2019\u2019W at \n\n306 m a.s.l.) was 14.9 oC (SNIRH, 2011: 1991-2011). Annual rainfall at the nearest rainfall \n\nstation (Ribeiradio: 40\u00ba 73\u2019 65\u2019\u2019N, 8\u00ba 30\u2019 08\u2019\u2019W at 228 m a.s.l.) was, on average, 1609 mm but \n\nvaried markedly between 960 and 2530 mm (SNIRH, 2011: 1991-2011). The study area is \n\npart of the Hespheric Massif, one of the region\u00b4s major physiographic units. This unit mainly \n\nconsists of pre-Ordovician schists and greywackes but includes Hercynian granites at several \n\nlocations (Ferreira, 1978). According to the existing soil map (1: 1 000 000; Cardoso et al., \n\n1973), the soils in the study area are predominantly Humic Cambisols. However, the soils of \n\nthe four study sites were also described in the field, and ranged from Humic Leptosols to \n\nHumic Cambisols at the BEG and BES sites; Lithic Leptosols to Humic Leptosols at the BPS \n\nsite; and Umbric Leptosols at the UES site (IUSS, 2006).

The uppermost 2 cm of the soils at the study \n\nsites were rather coarse, with a loam to sandy-clay loam texture, and very rich in organic \n\nmatter, ranging from 16 to 29 % (Table 2.1). \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - General slope description.

One of the strips was used for repeated \n\ncollection of soil samples, another for measuring runoff at the micro-plot scale, and the \n\nremaining for measuring runoff at the slope scale. The strips for the runoff measurements \n\nwere some 5 m wide, leaving the remaining part of the slope for destructive soil sampling. \n\nThe long-unburnt site was less wide, so that it was decided not to install the micro-plots. \n\nFor this study, only samples of the topsoil (0-2 cm depth) were collected because \n\nmoderate fires have been reported to mainly affect the upper 2 cm of soil (Bad\u00eda-Villas et al., \n\n2014a; 2014b). Soil samples were first collected on August 10 2010, before the occurrence of \n\nany rainfall after the wildfire, and then again on February 16 2011, before the terracing \n\noperations. At the first occasion, also samples of the ash layer were collected. Sampling was \n\ndone at five equally-spaced points along a transect that was laid out from the base to the top \n\nof the slope section, and shifted 1-2 m across the slope between subsequent sampling \n\noccasions. At each transect point the ashes were collected over an area of 0.5 m2 (0.5 m x 0.10 \n\nm) and the topsoil (0-2 cm depth) over an area of 0.25 m2 (0.5 m x 0.5 m). \n\nThe study sites were instrumented with runoff plots by August 25 2010, before the \n\noccurrence of any significant post-fire rainfall, as registered by various rainfall gauges that \n\nhad been installed across the burnt area (see underneath). This involved the installation, at \n\nthe base of the slope section of three bounded micro-plots of approximately 0.28 m2, at \n\ndistances of 1-2 m from each other. \n\nAs prior studies in the region have found contradictory results on the role of slope \n\nposition on post-fire runoff and erosion at the micro-plot scale (Malvar et al., 2015; Prats et \n\nal., 2014), the micro-plots were located at the base of the slope section where the forest stand \n\nwas planted (i.e. at the bottom of the property). This allowed easy access and, thus, facilitated \n\nspeedy data and sample collection, on the one hand, and, on the other, minimized the \n\ndisturbance to the slopes, which was a concern as the slopes were located within an \n\nexperimental catchment (Keizer et al., 2015). Four plot outlets of 0.5 m wide were also \n\ninstalled at the base of each slope section, together making up an unbounded slope-scale plot \n\nwith a width of approximately 2 m and contributing areas of 62 m2 (UES), 75 m2 (BPS), 97 m2 \n\n(BES) and 154 m2 (BEG). The outlets of the runoff plots were connected, using garden hose, to \n\none or more high-density polyethylene tanks of 30 or 70 L to collect the overland flow. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom August 25 2010 until February 23 2011, the runoff collected in the various tanks \n\nwas measured at 1- to 2-weekly intervals, mainly depending on the occurrence of rainfall. \n\nWhenever the runoff in a tank exceeded 250 mL, a sample was collected in a 500 mL \n\npolyethylene bottle that had been previously rinsed with HCl (pH &lt;2.0) and distilled and \n\ndeionised water. The samples were then transported to the laboratory in cool boxes and \n\nstored at 4 \u00baC for no longer than 24h. The 1- to 2-weekly field trips also involved \n\nmeasurement of the rainfall accumulated in four storage gauges (in-house design) that had \n\nbeen installed across the study area by the middle of August 2010. Their main purpose, \n\nhowever, was to validate the automatic recordings of two tipping-bucket rainfall gauges \n\n(Pronamic Professional Rain Gauge with 0.2 mm resolution) that had been installed at close \n\nproximity to two of the storage gauges. \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Laboratory work \n\nUpon arrival at the laboratory, the ash and soil samples were air dried. The base cation \n\ncontent of the first 2 cm of the topsoil was determined for each soil sample individually (n=5; \n\nFigure 1), whereas the base cations content of the ash layer was determined for one \n\ncomposite sample per site and sampling occasion (as the amounts of ash were limited). The \n\nsoil and composite ash samples were digested with HNO3 and H2SO4 in teflon vessels placed \n\nin a sand bath at 250\u00baC (APHA, 1998). After digestion, samples were filtered through paper \n\nfilters and then analysed for their Na, K, Ca and Mg concentrations using a Perkin Elmer \n\nAnalyst 200 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Because of logistic constraints, only \n\nabout half of the runoff samples that were collected during the 6-month study period could \n\nbe analysed for this study. The runoff samples analysed here were those collected following \n\nthe two monitoring periods (i.e. read-outs) of each month with the highest rainfall amounts, \n\nso that the runoff samples from in total 12 read-out periods were included in this study. The \n\nanalysis of total base cations (i.e. dissolved plus particulate forms) in the selected samples \n\neither started shortly upon arrival at the laboratory or, whenever that was not possible, was \n\ndelayed up to a maximum period of 6 months, after first acidifying the sample with HNO3 to a \n\npH below 2 and then storing it at 4\u00baC. The Na, K, Ca and Mg concentrations in runoff samples \n\nwere determined using the same procedure as described above for ash and soil samples. \n\nTotal suspended sediment concentration of the selected runoff samples was also determined, \n\nusing the standard gravimetric method (APHA, 1998). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n21 \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Data analysis \n\nDifferences in base cation contents of the ash and soil samples as well as differences in \n\nbase cation exports by runoff and the respective concentrations were evaluated for the pairs \n\nof study sites with contrasting forest types (BES vs. BPS), parent materials (BES vs. BEG) and \n\nfire regimes (BES vs. UES). This was done with the Student\u2019s t-test if the assumptions of \n\nnormality and homogeneity of variance were not rejected. If one or both of them were indeed \n\nrejected, square root and logarithmic transformations of the data were tried first and, if \n\nunsuccessful, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test was applied (Zar, 1999). \n\nRelationships between the base cation exports at the different study sites for each read-out \n\nwere explored by means of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Zar, 1999). The \n\nSpearman rank correlation coefficient was also computed to assess how well selected \n\nenvironmental variables (rainfall amount and intensity, total overland flow, sediment losses) \n\ncould explain the export of Na, K, Ca and Mg, both at the micro-plot and slope scale (Zar, \n\n1999). All statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 11.0 package software, \n\nemploying a significance level of 0.05. \n\n2.3 Results and discussion \n\n2.3.1 Base cation contents in ash and topsoil \n\nIn the ashes collected at the different eucalypt and pine sites immediately after the \n\nwildfire, the common order of abundance of base cations was Ca2+ > K+ > Mg2+ > Na+ (Table \n\n2.2.). These results are consistent to those found by Gabet and Bookter (2011) which also \n\nanalysed ash cations by acid digestion, however if exchangeable forms were quantified, the \n\norder of cation abundance would be expected to differ: Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ > Na+ (Ferreira et al., \n\n2005; Khanna et al., 1994).   \n\nThe comparison between ash cation contents at the eucalypt site (BES) and the maritime \n\npine site on schist (BPS) did not reveal significant differences (Student\u2019s t-test, p>0.05) \n\nbetween the two types of tree plantations (Table 2.2.). Nonetheless, base cation contents \n\nwere, on average, consistently higher in the ashes collected at the BPS than BES site (Table \n\n2.2.). Between-site differences in ash cation contents could reflect differences in either \n\nvegetation or litter layer, or both (Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Ferreira et al., 2005; Khanna et al., 1994; \n\nPereira et al., 2011; Soto and Diaz-Fierros, 1993).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n22 \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 - Average (\u00b1 standard deviation) base cation concentrations/stocks in the ash and topsoil \n\nlayers of burnt slopes, immediately (August 2010) and sixth months (February 2011) after fire.

However, as base cation concentrations were \n\nconsistently higher at the BPS than BES site, one might hypothesize that litter layers \n\ninfluenced ash cation contents since long-unburnt maritime pine stands in the study region \n\ntypically have more developed litter layers than long-unburnt eucalypt stands. As a result of \n\ntheir well-developed litter layers, pre-fire carbon stocks and cation contents in the organic \n\nsoil horizon of maritime pine stands (Nunes et al., 2010) are usually higher than in eucalypt \n\nstands (Ribeiro et al., 2002), so one might presume that soil organic matter combustion \n\ncontributed to the higher cation contents in BPS ashes. On the other hand, tree combustion \n\ncould have also played a role in the cation availability in ashes because trees were partially \n\nconsumed by fire (Table 2.1). The pronounced difference in Ca2+ contents, in particular, \n\npossibly reflected the difference in tree composition, since the Ca2+ content at the BEG site \n\nwas also markedly lower than at the BPS site. Such a pine vs. eucalypt contrast in ash Ca2+ \n\ncontent could well involve differences in combustion characteristics, since eucalyptus leaves \n\n(Ribeiro et al., 2002) have higher cation contents than pine needles (Nunes et al., 2010).  \n\nNa+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ash contents immediately after the wildfire were, on average, higher \n\nthan topsoil contents, whereas the opposite was true for K+ (Table 2.2.). The natural \n\navailability of this cation in soils (cf. UES data; Table 2.2) together with its high temperature \n\nthreshold (i.e. temperature at which a given cation is volatilized) in soils [760-774\u00baC; cf. Bod\u00ed \n\net al. (2014) and Knoepp et al. (2005)], might account for the different pattern of K+ ash/soil \n\nconcentrations. Since the present, moderate-severity fire (with NIR-based estimates of \n\nMaximum Temperature Reached at 0-2 cm depth ranged from 325 to 405 \u00baC; Pedrosa, 2012) \n\nwas unlikely to have produced important K+ losses from the topsoil through volatilization and \n\nsince K+ is not the most abundant cation in vegetation and litter (Nunes et al., 2010; Ribeiro et \n\nal., 2002), K+ contents were expected to be higher in the soil than in the ashes. On the other \n\nhand, differences between ash and soil concentrations were particularly pronounced in the \n\ncase of Ca2+, with lower (90\u201395 %) concentrations in soil than ash samples, as would be \n\nexpectable from previous studies (Ferreira et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2007; Pereira et al., \n\n2012). The reason behind these findings is two-fold. On one hand it can relate to the natural \n\ncomposition of litter layers and vegetation, which is typically Ca2+ enriched (Nunes et al., \n\n2010; Ribeiro et al., 2002), and on the other, to the temperature threshold (1240-1484 \u00baC) for \n\nCa2+ in soils, which is higher than for the other cations (Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Knoepp et al., 2005). \n\nAs a consequence, Ca2+ and K+ swapped places in the order of predominance of base cations \n\nin the topsoil compared to the ash layer. \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n24 \n\n \n\nThe comparison of the topsoil base cation contents, in August 2010, at the recently burnt \n\nand long-unburnt eucalypt plantations on schist (BES vs. UES) suggested that the wildfire did \n\nhave a significant (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test, p<0.01) direct effect but just in the case of \n\nCa2+ (Table 2.2). The combustion of belowground biomass and topsoil organic matter during \n\nfire is likely to have promoted a Ca2+ increase in soils since this material is typically Ca2+ \n\nenriched (Knoepp et al., 2005; Nunes et al., 2010; Ribeiro et al., 2002). Likewise, the \n\nincorporation of Ca2+ enriched ground ash (Table 2.2) into the soils could have influenced \n\nCa2+ availability since substantial increases in soil Ca2+ contents have been reported after ash \n\ndeposition (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Caon et al., 2014; Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992). \n\nThe relative proportion of cations in soils also seems to have been affected by fire, as \n\nreported by other authors (Caon et al., 2014; Knoepp et al., 2005), since the order of \n\nabundance of cations at the BES site (K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+) was clearly different than at the \n\nUES site (K+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > Ca2+). Like in the case of the ash layer, base cation contents in the \n\ntopsoil did not reveal significant differences (Student\u2019s t-test, p>0.1) between the two types of \n\ntree plantations on schist (Table 2.2). Also in agreement with the ash results, the average \n\ntopsoil contents of all four cations, immediately after fire, were consistently higher at the \n\nmaritime pine (BPS) than eucalypt site (BES). This could be due to a somewhat higher soil \n\nburnt severity at the eucalypt site, as its higher organic matter content (Table 2.1) would \n\npresume higher base cation contents (Granged et al., 2011; Knoepp et al., 2005; Soto and \n\nDiaz-Fierros, 1993; Terefe et al., 2008). Topsoil base cation contents did not differ \n\nsignificantly between the two types of parent material either (Student\u2019s t-test and Mann-\n\nWhitney Rank Sum test, p>0.3). All four base cations did, however, consistently revealed \n\nhigher concentrations at the eucalypt site on granite (BEG) than schist (BES), most likely due \n\nto the higher organic matter content of BEG soils (Table 2.2) which increases cation exchange \n\ncapacity and their retention in soils (Granged et al., 2011; Knoepp et al., 2005; Terefe et al., \n\n2008). \n\nFrom August 2010 to February 2011, a decrease in soil cation contents was observed at \n\nthe long-unburnt site (UES), possibly as result of erosion, cation leaching into deeper soil \n\nlayers, and/or plant uptake (Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2008; Khanna et al., 1994; \n\nKnoepp et al., 2005). For the burnt slopes, a similar justification can be given for the lower \n\nNa+, K+ and Mg2+ soil contents observed six months after the fire, but the same is not true for \n\nCa2+ since its contents almost doubled between the two sampling periods (Table 2.2). In the \n\ncase of this element, the results most likely reflected leaching of Ca2+-enriched-ash into the \n\nsoil (Ferreira et al., 2008; Knoepp et al., 2005; Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992; Soto and Diaz-Fierros, \n\n1993; Wangthongchai et al., 2008), since substantially higher Ca2+ concentrations were \n\nobserved in ashes than in soils (Table 2.2). Despite the temporal variations, the relative \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n25 \n\nproportion of cations in soils was maintained at the long-unburnt (K+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > Ca2+) and \n\nburnt eucalypt site on schist (K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+), suggesting that the influence of fire \n\nwas still present after a six month period (Caon et al., 2014). Differences among sites with \n\ndistinct types of vegetation (BPS vs. BES) and parent material (BEG vs. BES) were also \n\nmaintained between the two sampling periods, which reinforces the hypothesis of processes \n\noccurring within the \u201cwindow of disturbance\u201d (Ferreira et al., 2005, 2008; Shakesby and \n\nDoerr, 2006). \n\n2.3.2 Base cation export by overland flow \n\n2.3.2.1 Micro-plot scale \n\nThe 12 read-outs selected for this study, which represent the two monitoring periods of \n\neach month with the highest rainfall amounts, corresponded to 962 of the 1205 mm of \n\nrainfall that fell over the entire study period, and amounted, on average, to 74 % of the \n\noverland flow produced by the micro-plots over this 6-months period. The associated total \n\nbase cation losses at the three recently burnt sites differed markedly for the four elements \n\n(Table 2.3). At all three sites, total Mg2+ exports were lowest and total K+ exports highest, with \n\nrelative differences between the two cations ranging from a factor of 3 to 5. The relative \n\norder of total Ca2+ and Na+ losses, on the other hand, was possibly related to parent material, \n\nsince Ca2+ export was, on average, higher at the two sites on schist (BES and BPS) but lower at \n\nthe site on granite (BEG). Assuming the ash layer to be the principal source of the exported \n\ncations, either in its dissolved or particulate form, K+ and Na+ were over-represented in the \n\nobserved exports. K+ was the most exported cation but ranked second in the ashes, while Na+ \n\nwas the least abundant in the ashes but ranked second/third in terms of exports (Table 2.2 \n\nand Table 2.3). Ca2+ and Mg2+, on the other hand, were under-represented because their rank \n\nin post-fire overland flow was lower than in the ashes (Table 2.2 and Table 2.3). Such a \n\npreferential transport of monovalent over divalent cations would agree well with their higher \n\nsolubility in water (Brais et al., 2000; Cancelo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013; Certini, 2005; Knoepp et \n\nal., 2005; Soto and Diaz-Fierros, 1993).  The lower affinity of monovalent cations to bind to \n\nsoil organic matter might also account for these results as they are less likely to be retained in \n\nsoils (Cancelo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013; Knoepp et al., 2005; Soto and Diaz-Fierros, 1993). In fact, \n\nthe exports of monovalent cations tended to represent a larger fraction of the topsoil cation \n\nstocks (Table 2.2 and Table 2.3) than the exports of divalent cations (11- 93% vs. 4-27%). \n\nThis could indicate that the topsoil acted as a source of K+ and Na+ losses at the micro-plot \n\nscale once the ash layer was exhausted as a source, whereas it acted as a sink of divalent \n\ncations and, in particular, Ca2+. \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n26 \n\n \nTable 2.3 - Total (dissolved plus particulate) average (\u00b1 standard deviation) cation losses, overland \n\nflow, runoff coefficients (%) and sediment losses at the micro-plot scale for the 12 selected read-outs \n\nduring the first six months following a wildfire.

At the BES site, losses of dominant ash and soil cations like K+ and Ca2+ were \n\nhighly correlated to variables related to hydrological processes (Table 2.4), in particular to \n\nrainfall intensity (r=0.65 for K+; r=0.87 for Ca2+) and overland flow (r=0.52 for K+; r=0.81 for \n\nCa2+). Malvar et al. (2015) and Prats et al. (2014) also found that rainfall intensity was a key \n\nfactor in the post-fire response of micro-plots in recently burnt eucalypt stands in the study \n\nregion, especially in terms of sediment losses. The higher soil hydrophobicity combined with \n\na slower recovery of litter and ground vegetation under burnt eucalypt stands were likely to \n\nhave promoted overland flow and the associated cation losses (Table 2.3) at the BES site \n\n(Doerr et al., 1998; Knoepp et al., 2005; Malvar et al., 2011, 2013; Thomas et al., 1999, \n\n2000b), particularly under intense rainfall.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.4 - Spearman Rank correlations between environmental variables (rainfall amount and \n\nmaximum intensity during 30 minutes - I30, overland flow and suspended sediments) and cation \n\nlosses (averages per read out), at micro-plot scale.

This stronger dependence on erosion processes confirms the idea of other \n\nauthors (Knoepp et al., 2005; Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992; Martins et al., 2013; Thomas et al., \n\n2000a, 2000b) that the existence of a needle cover, resulting from needle cast from the \n\npartially combusted crowns of resinous trees, may act as a protection for soils, thereby \n\nlimiting overland flow and the associated sediment and cation losses at burnt pine sites. \n\nParent material also played an important role in cation export (Table 2.3 and Figure 2.2) \n\nsince losses were 1.5 to 4 times higher on schist (BES) than on granite (BEG). As cations are \n\nadsorbed on the surface of negatively charged materials such as organic colloids, higher \n\nexports would be expected from the organically-poor schist soils than granite soils (Table \n\n2.1) due to the existence of fewer cation exchange sites (Granged et al., 2011; Knoepp et al., \n\n2005; Terefe et al., 2008; Shakesby 2011). On the other hand, the sandy texture of granite \n\nsoils might have provided greater water infiltration capacity at micro-plot scale (Boix-Fayos \n\net al., 2006; Shakesby, 2011), thereby generating lower amounts of overland flow and \n\nconsequently lower cation exports at the BEG site (Table 2.3). Differences between the \n\nrelative order of total Na+ and Ca2+ losses on granite and schist seem to be linked to soil \n\nproperties and hydrological processes. The high correlation coefficients between Na+ losses \n\nand overland flow at the BEG site (Table 2.4) suggest that the export of the highly-soluble Na+ \n\nions was promoted by the lack of Na+-adsorption sites in granite soils (possibly due to the \n\nhigher availability of divalent cations), especially since lower amounts of overland flow were \n\nrequired for Na+ mobilization at the BEG site than at the BES site (Table 2.3). As a \n\nconsequence, Na+ exports were also higher at the BEG site than at the BES site. In the case of \n\nthe divalent cations which are less easily mobilized as monovalent ions (Cancelo-Gonz\u00e1lez et \n\nal., 2013; Soto and Diaz-Fierros, 1993; \u00dabeda et al., 2009), however, the amount of overland \n\nflow generated was a limiting factor in promoting promote Ca2+ export at the BEG site \n\n(r=0.35) but not at the BES site (r=0.81). \n\n2.3.2.2 Slope scale \n\nAt slope scale, the 12 read-outs selected for this study amounted, on average, to 92 % of \n\nthe total overland flow produced by the open-plots. As regards to the associated total cation \n\nlosses, values were, on average, 2-fold lower (Table 2.5) at the long-unburnt (UES) than at the \n\nrecently burnt eucalypt plantations on schist (BES). Fire disruption of soil structure and \n\nhydraulic properties might account for these findings (Ferreira et al., 2005; 2008; Shakesby, \n\n2011; Thomas et al., 1999, 2000b), since sediment losses were higher at the burnt site, but \n\nnot the overland flow (Table 2.5).  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n29 \n\n \n \n\nTable 2.5 - Total (dissolved plus particulate) average cation losses, overland flow, runoff coefficients \n\n(%) and sediment losses at slope scale, for the 12 selected read-outs during the first six months \n\nfollowing a wildfire.

For each line, different symbols, letters and \n\nnumbers correspond to significant differences (p<0.05) among slopes with respectively, different \n\nparent material (BEG vs BES), vegetation (BES vs BPS) and fire regime (BES vs UES). \n\n \n\nVariable BEG BES BPS UES \n\nCation losses (g m-2)     \n Na+ 0.16* \n\n \n\n0.04+, a,1 0.05a 0.051 \n\n K+ 1.04* 0.10+,a,1 0.09a 0.042 \n\n Ca2+ 0.35* 0.05+,a,1 0.05a 0.021 \n\n Mg2+ 0.18* 0.02+,a,1 0.02a 0.011 \n\nOverland flow (mm)\u00b0 24.0* 10.5+,a,1 10.8a 14.31 \n\nRunoff coefficient (%) 2.4* 0.9+,a,1 0.8a 1.51 \n\nSediment losses (g m-2) 140.2* 6.1+,a,1 3.5a 1.22 \n o Total rainfall associated = 962 mm \n\n \n\n \n\nFor this site (BES), the addition of ash to the soils might have increased soil water \n\nretention, leading to lower runoff generation (Ebel et al., 2012). However, the ash layer was \n\nnot able to prevent the detachment of soil particles by rainsplash erosion. An analysis of the \n\namount of overland flow associated to each read-out seems to support this idea since runoff, \n\nunlike sediment losses, was higher at the BES than UES site in the second trimester after fire.  \n\nOn the other hand, at the unburnt site, the high hydrophobicity of soils under eucalypt \n\nstands particularly after a dry season might have also been responsible for the higher runoff \n\namounts observed in the first trimester after the fire, since high soil moisture levels are \n\nrequired to break soil water repellency (Keizer et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2013). As regards to \n\nsediments, the existence of a soil protective layer (litter and vegetation) at unburnt sites, \n\nmost likely prevented sediment losses during the period of intense overland flow. The \n\nSpearman Rank correlation analyses presented in Table 2.6 clearly suggest that differences in \n\ncation exports between unburnt and burnt sites must be related to differences in hydrological \n\nand erosion processes, since little effect of environmental variables were found at the UES \n\nsite, unlike at the BES site (Figure 2.3 and Table 2.6).

In the BES site, on the other hand, K+ and Ca2+ were respectively the \n\nfirst and second most exported cations, possibly as a result of the depletion of the cation-\n\nenriched ash layer as hypothesized at the micro-plot scale (cf. Section 2.3.2.1). For the other \n\nburnt sites (BEG and BPS), K+ was also the element with the highest export rates, but the \n\nrelative order of export of the other cations differed from the BES site. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Correlations between cation losses in sites with different fire regime (BES vs. UES), \nvegetation (BES vs. BPS) and parent material (BES vs. BEG), at slope scale. Data points correspond to \nthe average cation losses in each of the 12 read-outs analyzed for the present study. \n\n \n\n \n\nAt the BPS site, the exports of highly reactive-highly soluble cations (K+>Na+) were \n\nhigher than that of less reactive-less soluble divalent cations (Ca2+>Mg2+). At the BEG site, \n\ncation exports followed the order of soil cation contents (cf. Section 3.1), thereby suggesting \n\nthat cation losses were more dependent on soil erosion than on metal reactivity (i.e. solubility \n\nin water and affinity to bind to organic matter).  \n\nFor the burnt slopes, differences in cation exports were also identified between micro-\n\nplot and slope scale. In comparison to the micro-plot scale, a substantial decrease (one order \n\nof magnitude) in cation exports was observed at slope scale (Table 2.3 and Table 2.5).  \n\nAlthough a higher number of micro-plots would have been desirable to capture the \n\nheterogeneity within each slope, in the present study, the cation exports measured at the \n\nthree micro-plots did not encompassed slope-scale exports. Therefore, one can presume that \n\nthe lower cation exports were largely the result of lower overland flow and erosion rates at \n\nthe slope scale (Table 2.5) since cation exports were strongly dependent on hydrological and \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n32 \n\nerosion processes (Table 2.6). This seems to agree with the current opinion that runoff and \n\nerosion decrease with increasing spatial scale (Boix-Fayos et al., 2006; Coelho et al., 2004; \n\nFerreira et al., 2005, 2008; Shakesby, 2011), especially due to re-infiltration opportunities \n\nresulting from a high spatial variability of soil water repellency, macroporosity and \n\nvegetation patterns following fire (Boix-Fayos et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2008; Shakesby, \n\n2011).  \n\nWhen comparing sites with different pre-fire vegetation features (Table 2.5 and Figure \n\n2.3), similar cation exports were observed at eucalypt (BES) and pine plantations (BPS) on \n\nschist, in opposition to what was observed at micro-plot scale (cf. Section 2.3.2.1). The \n\nimprovement of hydrological connectivity at larger scales might have reduced the water \n\nerosion at the BES site (Table 2.5), since cations losses were highly correlated to sediment \n\nlosses (Table 2.6), unlike at micro-plot scale (Figure 2.3). Despite these results, cation exports \n\nwere, on average, lower at the BPS than BES site, which confirms the importance of a soil \n\nprotective layer for the reduction of cation losses in burnt areas (cf. Section 2.3.2.1).  \n\nParent material, on the other hand, had a significant effect (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum \n\ntest, p<0.01) on base cation exports in burnt areas, since higher cation losses (one order of \n\nmagnitude) were found at the granite (BEG) than at the schist (BES) site (Table 2.5), as \n\nopposite to the micro-plot scale (Table 2.3). These findings seem to support the idea that \n\nprocesses occurring at larger scales are more likely to resemble the natural hydrological and \n\nerosive response of burnt slopes, since higher overland flow and associated sediment and \n\ncation losses as found in the present study (Table 2.5), have been reported for sandy soils \n\n(Knoepp et al., 2005; Shakesby, 2011). \n\n2.3.3 Cation concentrations in overland flow \n\n2.3.3.1 Micro-plot scale \n\nImmediately after the first post-fire rainfall event, all burnt sites exhibited a peak in total \n\nbase cation concentrations (Figure 2.4) as a response to the leaching of the cation rich-easily \n\nerodible ash layer (Ferreira et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 1999). As the ash reservoir diminished \n\nand eroded sediments progressively coarsened (which causes a reduction of the cations \n\nsorption capacity to eroded soil particles), a sharp decrease in cation levels was observed, \n\nparticularly in the first two months following fire (Figure 2.4). From this point one, cation \n\nconcentrations were maintained at low levels and slight peaks occurred only as a response to \n\nextreme rainfall events, as referred by other authors (Ferreira et al., 2005; Soto et al., 1997). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.4 - Cation concentrations in overland flow (mg L-1) at micro-plot scale. BEG \u2013 burnt eucalypt-\ngranite site; BES \u2013 burnt eucalypt-schist site and BPS \u2013 burnt pine-schist site. \n\n \n\n2.3.3.2 Slope scale \n\nThe comparison between cation concentrations at the long-unburnt (UES) and burnt \n\neucalypt plantations on schist (BES), confirms the impact of wildfires as higher cation \n\nconcentrations were found at BES than UES site (Figure 2.5). The increase of bare soil areas \n\nas a result of the (partial) combustion of vegetation and litter layer (Ferreira et al., 2005; Soto \n\net al., 1997; Soto and Diaz-Fierros, 1993; Thomas et al., 1999, 2000b), possibly promoted \n\noverland flow and the associated sediment and cation losses at the BES site (Table 2.5). In \n\ncomparison to the micro-plot scale, at a larger scale, cation concentrations exhibited clear \n\ndifferences between burnt sites as well as a more complex variation pattern (Figure 2.5). At \n\nthe granite site (BEG), several cation peaks were observed within the first 6 months after fire, \n\nwhereas at schist sites (BES and BPS) high cation levels were only found during a short \n\nperiod of time (1 to 2 months) after burning (Figure 2.5). A potential explanation for these \n\npatterns involves the existence of a continuous source of cations on granite \u2013 the topsoil, and \n\na finite source on schist \u2013 the cation-rich ash layer (Ferreira et al. 2005). As a consequence, \n\nhigher cation exports were found on granite than on schist (Table 2.5 and Figure 2.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.5 - Cation concentrations in overland flow (mg L-1) at slope scale. BEG \u2013 burnt eucalypt-\n\ngranite site; BES \u2013 burnt eucalypt-schist site; BPS \u2013 burnt pine-schist site and UES \u2013 unburnt eucalypt-\n\nschist site. \n\n \n\n2.4 Conclusions \n\nThe present study clearly demonstrated the effects of wildfires on cation mobilization by \n\noverland flow. Cation exports were particularly intense in the two months after fire but after \n\nthis initial period, peaks in cation concentrations were also observed in association to intense \n\nrainfall events. \n\nThese results suggest that wider time scales (i.e. wider than 6 months) are needed to \n\nevaluate the full extension of wildfires on forest lands. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to \n\nrecommend that post-fire management efforts should focus on the first 3 months after fire, to \n\nminimize the loss of soil fertility and degradation of burnt forest areas. \n\nThe present work also showed that scale size is an important factor when studying the \n\neffects of wildfires on soil degradation, since different responses were observed at micro-plot \n\nand slope scale. At smaller scales, cation losses were higher than at larger scales, possibly \n\nbecause runoff and erosion decreases at larger scales as a result of changes in the soil \n\ninfiltration patterns. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n35 \n\nThese findings confirm the idea that although micro-plots may be suitable to quickly \n\ncharacterize the hydrological and erosion response in burnt forest areas, studies carried out \n\nat a larger scale are probably closer to reality due to a better representation of the natural \n\nconnectivity within forest systems. \n\nStudies at broader spatial scales, as well as wider time scales, are therefore \n\nrecommended to assess the effective risk of post-fire soil fertility loss, which has important \n\nimplications for the recovery process of burned Mediterranean forests as well as for post-fire \n\nland management. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe present study was carried out in the framework of the FIRECNUTS project \n\n(PTDC/AGRCFL/104559/2008), funded by the FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC), with co-funding by \n\nFEDER through COMPETE (Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade; POFC), and \n\nwith support of the research grants, attributed by FCT/MCTES, of Dalila Serpa \n\n(SFRH/BPD/92650/2013), Raquel Vasconcelos Ferreira (SFRH/BD/45778/2008) and Mar\u00eda \n\nLuz Rodr\u00edguez-Blanco (SFRH/BPD/90640/2012).

Most of the studies on fire-affected areas \n\nhave focused on sediment losses by overland flow, whereas few have addressed post-fire \n\nnutrient export. The present study aimed to address this research gap by assessing nitrogen \n\n(nitrate and total nitrogen) losses by overland flow in a recently burnt area in north-central \n\nPortugal. To this end, three burnt slopes were selected for their contrasting forest types \n\n(eucalypt vs. pine) and parent materials (granite vs. schist). The selected study sites were a \n\neucalypt site on granite (BEG), a eucalypt site on schist (BES) and a maritime pine site on \n\nschist (BPS). Overland flow samples were collected during the first six months after the \n\nwildfire on a 1- to 2-weekly basis, after which this study had to be cancelled due to bench \n\nterracing of some of the sites. A peak in total nitrogen concentrations was observed in burnt \n\nareas immediately after the first post-fire rainfall event as a response to the erosion of the N-\n\nenriched ash layer. After this initial peak, smaller peaks were observed throughout the study \n\nperiod, mainly as a response to overland flow and/or erosion events. Nitrogen export differed \n\nstrikingly between the two types of forests on schist, being higher at the eucalypt than at the \n\npine site, due to the lack of a protective soil layer. Parent material did not play an important \n\nrole on nitrogen export by overland flow since no significant differences were found between \n\nthe eucalypt sites on granite and schist. The present study provides some insight into the \n\ndifferences in post-fire soil fertility losses between forest types and parent materials in the \n\nMediterranean region, which is crucial information for defining post-fire land management \n\nmeasures to reduce soil degradation. \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n44 \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nWildfire, Micro-Plot Scale, Overland Flow, Nitrogen Loss, Vegetation, Geology \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe increasing frequency of wildfires over the past decades has raised the concern over \n\nthe resilience capacity of Mediterranean ecosystems to fire (Pausas et al., 2008; Pereira et al., \n\n2006; Shakesby, 2011). By altering vegetation and soil properties, a fire typically disrupts the \n\nhydrological and geomorphological processes in forest areas (Shakesby, 2011; Shakesby and \n\nDoerr, 2006), so recurrent wildfires are likely to affect the functioning of natural systems. In \n\nthe Mediterranean region, in particular, fires have been reported to increase overland flow \n\ngeneration and the associated soil and nutrient losses (Caon et al., 2014; Certini, 2005; \n\nFerreira et al., 2005; Machado et al., 2015; Pausas et al., 2008; Shakesby, 2011; Thomas et al., \n\n1999, 2000a, 2000b), increasing the risk of degradation of the already shallow and poor \n\nMediterranean soils (Ferreira et al., 2005; Shakesby, 2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006).  \n\nPost-fire nutrient losses by water occur mainly during the earlier stages of the so-called \n\n\u2018\u2018window-of-disturbance\u2019\u2019 (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). This has typically been attributed to \n\nthe (partial) consumption of the protective litter and vegetation cover, which promotes \n\noverland flow generation and soil erosion (Andreu et al., 2001; Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Ferreira et \n\nal., 2005; Prats et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 1999). However, also the exhaustion of the \n\nnutrient-enriched ash layer deposited after the fire has been suggested as an important factor \n\n(Caon et al., 2014; Khanna et al., 1994; Knoepp et al., 2005; Pausas et al., 2008; Pereira et al., \n\n2005; Shakesby, 2011; Thomas et al., 1999). Nonetheless, the magnitude of post-fire nutrient \n\nlosses appears to be extremely variable, depending on an interplay of factors such as fire \n\nseverity and recurrence (Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Brais et al., 2000; Caon et al., 2014; Knoepp et al., \n\n2005; Neary et al., 1999; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006), post-fire rainfall patterns (Bod\u00ed et al., \n\n2014; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006), vegetation type and recovery (Caon et al., 2014; Cerd\u00e0 and \n\nDoerr, 2008; Certini, 2005; Knoepp et al., 2005; Neary et al., 1999), terrain steepness (Bod\u00ed et \n\nal., 2014; Certini, 2005; Neary et al., 1999; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006) and soil characteristics \n\n(Certini, 2005; Neary et al., 1999; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006).  \n\nIn spite of the relevance of soil nutrient status for the productivity of Mediterranean \n\nforest ecosystems (Andreu et al., 1996; Dur\u00e1n et al., 2010; Ferreira et al., 2005; Gimeno-\n\nGarc\u00eda et al., 2000; Pardini et al., 2003; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2009), post-fire nutrient losses by \n\noverland flow have been poorly studied in the Mediterranean Basin (e.g. Cancelo-Gonz\u00e1lez et \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n45 \n\nal., 2013; DeBano et al., 1998; D\u00edaz-Fierros et al., 1990; Lasanta and Cerd\u00e0, 2005; Machado et \n\nal., 2015). In the case of Portugal, few studies have measured post-fire nitrogen export by \n\noverland flow (Coelho et al., 2004; Ferreira et al., 1997, 2005; Thomas et al., 2000a, b; Walsh \n\net al., 1992). Like the present study, most of the prior studies investigated nitrogen losses for \n\nthe two principal forest types in north-central Portugal, i.e. plantations of eucalypt \n\n(Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), but they only evaluated \n\nsolute losses and not total nitrogen losses (i.e. solute + particulate fraction). Furthermore, \n\nprior studies involved larger spatial scales than this study, i.e. 16 m2 plots (Ferreira et al., \n\n1997, 2005; Thomas et al., 2000a, b; Walsh et al., 1992) and small catchments (Ferreira et al., \n\n1997, 2005), which typically have more complex hydrological and erosion responses.  \n\nA better understanding of post-fire nutrient export behaviour, in both its dissolved and \n\nparticulate forms, is therefore crucial for a more reliable assessment of soil fertility losses \n\nfollowing wildfires as well as of their potential eutrophication effects on downstream aquatic \n\nsystems.  \n\nThe present study aims to address this knowledge gap, by evaluating total nitrogen \n\nexports by post-fire overland flow in a recently burnt area of the western Mediterranean \n\nBasin. Since it proved impossible to find a long-unburnt pine plantation in the immediate \n\nsurroundings of the burnt area and since it was preferred to instrument a nearby long-\n\nunburnt eucalypt plantation with slope-scale plots rather than of micro-plots (see for more \n\ndetails in Machado et al., 2015), this study does not allow to assess the effects of fire on \n\nnitrogen losses by overland flow. Instead, the main purpose of the current work was to \n\ncompare post-fire nitrogen losses for different combinations of land cover and parent \n\nmaterial. The specific objectives were to quantify total nitrogen as well as nitrate losses by \n\noverland flow at the micro-plot scale for: (i) two contrasting forest types - i.e. eucalypt and \n\nmaritime pine plantations, which dominate the north-central Portuguese mountains; (ii) for \n\ntwo contrasting bedrock types - i.e. schist and granite, which are the prevailing parent \n\nmaterials in north-central Portugal. These losses were furthermore related to the nitrogen \n\nstocks of the ash layer and the topsoil, for a better understanding of the N cycle following fire.  \n\nAs two of the three study sites were terraced 6 months after the fire in preparation for a \n\nnew eucalypt plantation, the present study had to be restricted to the immediate post-fire \n\nperiod because this technique completely altered the topography of the slopes (Martins et al., \n\n2013). Although this constitutes a drawback compared to the initial plans to monitor runoff \n\nand erosion during the first 2-3 years after fire, prior studies in the study region have \n\nsuggested that the post-fire hydrological and erosion response is strongest during the first 4 \n\nto 6 months after the wildfire (e.g. Ferreira et al., 2005, 2008; Malvar et al., 2011; Martins et \n\nal., 2013; Prats et al., 2014; Shakesby, 2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n46 \n\n \n\n3.2 Materials and Methods \n\n3.2.1 Study area and sites \n\nThe study area was located within the Vouga River Basin, near the Ermida village in the \n\nSever do Vouga municipality, north-central Portugal (Figure 3.1). \n \n\n \nFigure 3.1 - Location of the Ermida study area within the Vouga River basin, north-central Portugal. \n\nLocation of the study sites: BEG \u2014 burnt eucalypt-granite site, BES \u2014 burnt eucalypt schist site and \n\nBPS \u2014 burnt pine-schist site. Bold line represents the Ermida catchment. \n\n \n\nThe area was burnt between July 26 and July 28 2010 by a wildfire that consumed, in \n\ntotal, 295 ha of forest (DUDF, 2011). Before the fire, the \u201cErmida\u201d study area was \n\npredominantly covered by commercial eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus Labil.) plantations but \n\nalso included some maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) stands. Fire severity was, on overall, \n\nmoderate, since ashes were black, the litter layer and understory vegetation (herbs and \n\nshrubs) was almost completely consumed by fire, and tree crowns were only partially \n\ncombusted (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). According to Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n47 \n\nmeasurements, the maximum temperatures reached by topsoil (0-2 cm layer) during fire \n\nvaried from 325 to 405\u00baC in the study area (Pedrosa, 2012). Within the burnt area, three hill \n\nslopes were selected for this study for their contrasting forest types and parent materials \n\n(Figure 3.1). The BEG study site concerned an eucalypt plantation on granite, the BES site \n\nconcerned an eucalypt plantation on schist and the BPS site a maritime pine site on schist.  \n\nThe climate of the study area can be classified as humid meso-thermal with moderate \n\nbut prolonged warm dry summers (K\u00f6ppen; Csb, DRA-Centro, 2002). The mean annual \n\ntemperature at the nearest climate station (Castelo-Burg\u00e3es: 40\u00b051?10?N, 8\u00b0 22?44?W at 306 \n\nm a.s.l.) was 14.9 \u00b0C (1991\u20132011; SNIRH, 2011), with average monthly temperatures ranging \n\nfrom 8.9 \u00b0C in January to 21 \u00b0C in July. Annual rainfall at the nearest rainfall station \n\n(Ribeiradio: 40\u00b073?65?N, 8\u00b030?08?W at 228 m a.s.l.) was, on average, 1655 mm, but varied \n\nmarkedly between dry (960 mm) and wet (2530 mm) years (1991\u20132011; SNIRH, 2011). \n\nThe study area is part of the Hesperic Massif, one of the region\u2019s major physiographic \n\nunits. This unit is dominated by pre-Ordovician schists and greywackes but also includes \n\nHercynian granites (Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995). The granites exhibit evidences of granular \n\ndisintegration, otherwise designated by arenisation, with accumulation of sand particles and \n\ngravel. The soils are mapped as Humic Cambisols (1:1000000; Cardoso et al., 1973), but \n\naccording to a field survey carried out in the area, soils range from Humic Leptosols to Humic \n\nCambisols at the BEG and BES sites; and from Lithic Leptosols to Humic Leptosols at the BPS \n\nsite (IUSS, 2006). The topsoil (0\u20132 cm) at the study sites was rather coarse, with a loam to \n\nsandy-clay loam texture, and high (19\u201329%) organic matter content (Table 3.1). \n\n3.2.2 Experimental set-up, field data and sample collection \n\nEach of the study sites was divided into 2 strips running from the base to the top of the \n\nslope section. One of the strips was used for repeated collection of soil samples and the other \n\nfor measuring overland flow at the micro-plot scale. Samples and plots at each site were \n\ntreated as independent observations, although this can be questioned given the reduced \n\ndistances between the samples/plots. This possible form of pseudo-replication is, however, \n\ntypically difficult to avoid in wildfire studies (Hurlbert, 1984; Mantgem et al., 2001); in the \n\ncase of the study area, due to the impossibility to find three or more slopes that were \n\nsufficiently similar in land cover, parent material, terrain characteristics (exposition, slope \n\nangle) and fire severity to be considered replicate sites. Worth stressing is that the \n\nsamples/plots from each of the present study sites typically exhibited considerable \n\nvariability, suggesting that they can indeed be considered independent observations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n48 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 - General slope description.

Soil sampling was done on 2 occasions: first, \n\non August 10 2010, roughly two weeks after the wildfire and before the occurrence of any \n\nrainfall; and then again, on February 16 2011, before terrace construction. At the first \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n49 \n\noccasion, ash samples were collected along with soil samples. At both occasions ash and/or \n\nsoil sampling was done at five equally-distant points along a transect that was laid out from \n\nthe base to the top of the slope section. At each point of the transect ashes were collected over \n\nan area of 0.25 m2 (0.5 m \u00d7 0.5 m) and topsoil (0-2 cm depth) over an area of 0.06 m2 (0.25 m \n\n\u00d7 0.25 m). At the second sampling occasion, the transect was shifted approximately 1-2 m \n\nacross the slope. \n\nThe study sites were instrumented with overland flow plots on August 25 2010, before \n\nthe occurrence of post-fire rainfall. This involved the installation, at the base of the slope \n\nsection, of three replicate bounded micro-plots of approximately 0.28 m2, at distances of \n\n1-2 m from each other. The main criteria for the location of the micro-plots were: i) the easy \n\naccess, as it facilitates speedy data and sample collection, and ii) the minimization of slope \n\ndisturbance, which was a concern because the slopes were located within an experimental \n\ncatchment (Keizer et al., 2015). The outlets of the micro-plots were connected, using garden \n\nhose, to one or more high density polyethylene 30 to 70 L barrels to collect overland flow. \n\nFrom August 2010 to February 2011, overland flow was measured at 1- to 2-weekly \n\nintervals, depending on the occurrence of rainfall. Whenever the overland flow in a barrel \n\nexceeded 250 mL, a sample was collected in a 500 mL polyethylene bottle that had been \n\npreviously rinsed with HCl (pH &lt;2.0) and distilled and dionized water. The samples were \n\nthen transported to the laboratory in cool boxes and stored at 4\u00baC for no longer than 24 h. \n\nThe 1- to 2-weekly field trips also involved measurement of rainfall accumulated in 4 storage \n\ngauges (in-house design) that had been installed across the study area by the middle of \n\nAugust 2010. Their main purpose, however, was to validate the automatic recordings of two \n\ntipping-bucket rainfall gauges (Pronamic Professional Rain Gauge with 0.2 mm resolution) \n\nthat had been installed in close proximity to two of the storage gauges. \n\n3.2.3 Laboratory analyses \n\nUpon arrival to the laboratory, the ash and soil samples were air dried and sieved \n\nmanually with a 2 mm sieve. Total nitrogen content (TKN) in ashes and soils was determined \n\nusing the Kjeldahl method (Bremner, 1979). Aside from nitrogen, soil samples were also \n\nanalysed for: i) bulk density, using the core method as described by Porta et al. (2003); ii) soil \n\nparticle size, following the international method of mechanical analysis as defined by Guiti\u00e1n \n\nand Carballas (1976); and iii) organic matter, determined by loss on ignition at 550\u00baC for 4 h, \n\nas described by Botelho da Costa (2004).  \n\nOverland flow samples were analysed for total nitrogen (i.e. dissolved plus particulate N \n\nforms) and nitrate (NO3-N) using a flow injection FIAstarTM 5000 analyser (FOSS-Tecator). \n\nPrior to analysis, overland flow subsamples (50 mL) for determining NO3-N concentrations \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n50 \n\nwere filtered with 0.45 ?m Millipore\u00a9 membrane filters. Subsamples (50 mL) for analysing \n\nTN were subjected to an oxidative digestion, using peroxodisulphate/alkali (Oxisolv\u00ae, \n\nMerck) and then filtered. Total suspended solids (TSS) in overland flow samples were \n\nquantified gravimetrically through filtration of 50 to 150 mL of water by a glass fibre filter, \n\nfollowed by drying to a constant weight at 105 \u00baC (APHA, 1998). \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Data analyses \n\nDifferences in total Kjedahl nitrogen (TKN) ash and topsoil contents between sites with \n\ndifferent forest type (BES vs. BPS) and parent material (BEG vs. BES) were evaluated by a a \n\none-way ANOVA followed by a multi-comparison Tukey\u2019s test, if the assumptions of \n\nnormality (checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test) and homogeneity of variance (checked by the \n\nLevene\u2019s test) were not rejected. If one or both of them were rejected, logarithmic \n\ntransformations of the data were performed to comply with the assumptions of the ANOVA \n\n(Zar, 1999).  \n\nRegarding NO3-N and TN exports in overland flow and their respective concentrations, a \n\none-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey\u2019s test was performed to test differences between sites \n\nwith contrasting vegetation (BES vs. BPS) and parent material (BEG vs. BES), after checking \n\nfor data normality and homogeneity of variance. Whenever one or both of the ANOVA \n\nassumptions were not met, logarithmically transformed data was used in the analysis (Zar, \n\n1999). Between-site differences in overland flow and sediment losses were also evaluated by \n\na one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey\u2019s test.  \n\nThe influence of environmental variables (rainfall amount and intensity, overland flow \n\nand sediment losses) on nitrogen losses by overland flow was assessed by the Pearson\u2019s \n\ncorrelation coefficient. In the case of the variables that had not met the normality assumption \n\nby the above-mentioned Shapiro-Wilk test, the coefficients were computed for the \n\ntransformed data.  \n\nAll statistical analyses were performed with SigmaPlot 11.0 package software, using a \n\nsignificance level of 0.05. \n\n3.3 Results \n\n3.3.1 Ash and topsoil nitrogen contents \n\nThe average total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) content in ash and topsoil layers at the three \n\nstudy sites are shown in Table 3.2. No significant differences were observed between the \n\nashes collected at sites with contrasting forest type or parent material (ANOVA: F = 0.847, \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n51 \n\np = 0.455). At all the study sites, TKN contents immediately after the wildfire (August 2010) \n\nwere on average roughly twice as high in the ashes than in the topsoil (Table 3.2). \n\nThe comparison of topsoil nitrogen contents in August 2010 did not reveal significant \n\ndifferences (ANOVA: F = 0.325, p = 0.729) between the two types of tree plantations (BES vs. \n\nBPS) on schist (Table 3.2). Topsoil TKN contents did not differ significantly between the two \n\ntypes of parent material (BEG vs. BES) either (ANOVA: F = 0.325, p = 0.729). From August \n\n2010 to February 2011, a significant decrease (58 to 75%) in soil TKN contents was observed \n\nat all three study sites (Table 3.2). However, six months after the fire (Table 2), there were \n\nalso no significant differences between sites with distinct types of vegetation and parent \n\nmaterial (ANOVA: F = 0.801, p = 0.476). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - Average (\u00b1 standard deviation; n = 5) total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentrations/stocks \n\nin the ash and topsoil layers of the three study sites, immediately (August 2010) and sixth months after \n\nfire (February 2011).

At all the study sites, peaks of NO3-N and TN exports were \n\ngenerally associated to major runoff events. Nitrate exports, however, represented only a \n\nsmall fraction (1 to 6%) of TN exports. The comparison of NO3-N (ANOVA: F = 6.732, p = \n\n0.003; Tukey\u2019s test: p = 0.004) and TN exports (ANOVA: F = 4.346, p = 0.019; Tukey\u2019s test: p = \n\n0.016) between sites with contrasting types of vegetation revealed significant differences \n\nbetween the eucalypt and the pine site on schist (Figure 3.2). \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n52 \n\nGlobal TN losses over the entire study period (Table 3.3) were almost four times as high \n\nat the BES site (1.32 g m-2) than at the BPS site (0.35 g m-2). For NO3-N, differences between \n\nthe two sites were even more pronounced, being about 10 times higher at the BES site (0.04 g \n\nm-2) than at the BPS site (0.004 g m-2). Parent material, on the other hand, did not play an \n\nimportant role in post-fire nitrogen exports (Figure 3.2 since no significant differences were \n\nfound for either NO3-N losses (ANOVA: F = 6.732, p = 0.003; Tukey\u2019s test: p = 0.834) or TN \n\nlosses (ANOVA: F = 4.346, p = 0.019; Tukey\u2019s test: p = 0.130) at the BEG and BES sites. In \n\nterms of global exports, however, TN losses were more than two times higher at the BES site \n\n(1.32 g m-2) than at the BEG site (0.62 mg m-2), whereas NO3-N exports were very similar at \n\nthe two sites (BEG = 0.03 g m-2; BES = 0.04 g m-2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.2 - Average overland flow amounts, and nitrate (NO3-N) and total nitrogen (TN) losses by \n\noverland flow within the first 6 months after fire.

As regards to \n\nnitrate, the environmental variables governing the export of this inorganic nitrogen form \n\ndiffered with pre-fire vegetation (Table 3.4). \n\nAt the BES site, NO3-N losses were highly correlated with hydrological variables (rainfall \n\namount, rainfall intensity, and overland flow), whereas at the BPS site no significant \n\ncorrelations were found between NO3-N exports and the environmental variables \n\ninvestigated in the present study. Comparing the two sites with contrasting parent materials, \n\ndifferences were also observed between environmental variables controlling NO3-N exports \n\nat the granite and schist sites. At the BEG site NO3-N exports were highly correlated with both \n\nhydrological variables and sediment losses, whereas at the BES site they were mostly \n\ndependent on hydrological variables (Table 3.4). \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n54 \n\n \n \n\nTable 3.4 - Pearson\u2019s correlations between environmental variables (i.e. rainfall amount, maximum \n\nrainfall intensity during 30 min \u2013 I30, overland flow and suspended sediments) and nitrogen losses by \n\noverland flow (averages per read out).

For the subsequent study period, all slopes \n\nrevealed complex patterns in NO3-N concentrations, which appeared to be largely \n\nindependent from rainfall amounts as well as from overland flow and sediment losses at each \n\nsite (Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3).  \n\nAs regards to TN, a major peak was also observed for the first post-fire rainfall event but \n\nthis peak has occurred at all three study sites, unlike was the case for NO3-N (Figure 3.2 and \n\nFigure 3.3). After this initial peak, smaller peaks in TN levels were observed throughout the \n\nstudy period, mainly in association with peaks in overland flow or sediment losses (Figure \n\n3.2 and Figure 3.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.3 - Average sediment losses, and nitrate (NO3-N) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in \n\noverland flow within the first 6 months after fire.

As fire severity \n\nwas similar at the two study sites, these results most likely reflected the pre-fire N contents in \n\naboveground vegetation and litter layer, which were found to have  similar N levels in \n\nunburnt eucalypt (Ribeiro et al., 2002) and maritime pine stands (Nunes et al., 2010) in the \n\nstudy region. Sites with contrasting parent materials also presented similar TKN ash \n\ncontents, which agree with the fact that forest stands in the study region commonly have \n\nsimilar topsoil nitrogen contents on unburnt granite and schist soils, independently from the \n\ntype of tree plantation (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2011). For all the burnt sites, TKN ash contents \n\nimmediately after the wildfire were, on average, higher than topsoil contents. The reason \n\nbehind these findings is probably related to the natural composition of plant biomass and \n\nlitter layers, as they are typically richer in N than soils (Nunes et al., 2010; Ribeiro et al., \n\n2002). \n\nThe comparison of topsoil TKN contents, immediately after the wildfire, revealed no \n\nsignificant differences between the two types of tree plantations on schist, in agreement with \n\nthe results for the ash layer (Table 3.2). These results could be related to similar N contents in \n\nbelowground biomass and topsoil organic matter in unburnt eucalypt (Ribeiro et al., 2002) \n\nand pine sites (Nunes et al., 2010). This hypothesis is also supported by the similar organic \n\nmatter contents in BES (22%) and BPS (19%) soils, immediately after fire (Table 3.1). Topsoil \n\nTKN contents did not differ between the two types of parent material either, in accordance to \n\nwhat was found by other authors for unburnt forest areas in central Portugal (Magalh\u00e3es et \n\nal., 2011). An explanation for these findings would also be the existence of comparable \n\norganic matter contents in granite (29%) and schist (22%) soils (Table 3.1). \n\nFrom August 2010 to February 2011, a decrease in soil TKN contents was observed at all \n\nthree burnt sites. This could have involved two mechanisms, i.e. N leaching into deeper soil \n\nlayers as well as N losses by runoff and soil erosion (Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Caon et al., 2014; Cerd\u00e0 \n\nand Doerr, 2008; Certini, 2005; Khanna et al., 1994; Knoepp et al., 2005; Pausas et al., 2008; \n\nShakesby, 2011; Thomas et al., 1999). Six months after the fire, no significant differences in \n\nTKN contents were found among sites with distinct forest (BES vs. BPS) or with different \n\nparent materials (BEG vs. BES), in line with what was found immediately after the fire. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n57 \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Nitrogen exports by overland flow \n\nDespite the similar ash and topsoil N contents in eucalypt and pine sites, NO3-N and TN \n\nlosses were consistently higher at the eucalypt site on schist than at the pine site on schist \n\n(Table 3.2 and Table 3.3). The stronger soil water repellency in eucalypt than in pine stands, \n\nas has been observed in the study region both before and after wildfires (Doerr et al., 1998; \n\nKeizer et al., 2005a, b; Santos et al., 2013), combined with a somewhat slower recovery of \n\nlitter and ground vegetation under burnt eucalypt stands (Doerr et al., 1998) were likely to \n\nhave promoted overland flow and the associated sediment and N losses at the BES site. On \n\nthe other hand, the existence of a needle cover at the pine site, resulting from needle cast \n\nfrom the partially combusted pine crowns, might have reduced overland flow and the \n\nassociated sediment and nutrient transport (Knoepp et al., 2005; Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992) by \n\nincreasing surface storage and resistance against flow and, at the same time, decreasing \n\nsplash erosion (Martins et al., 2013; Prats et al., 2012, 2013; Shakesby et al., 1996; Thomas et \n\nal., 2000a, b). Other studies in the study region have also found needle cast following low and \n\nmoderate severity fires to be highly effective in reducing runoff and especially erosion \n\n(Martins et al., 2013; Prats et al., 2012, 2013; Shakesby et al., 1996; Thomas et al., 2000a, b). \n\nIn the case of soluble N forms, like NO3-N, the existence of a needle cover was particularly \n\nrelevant in preventing losses by overland flow, since NO3-N exports were not significantly \n\nrelated to any of the hydrological variables at the BPS site as opposed to the BES site (Table \n\n3.4). \n\nTN exports, on the other hand, were apparently less affected by the needle cover, since a \n\nstrong relationship was found between TN losses and hydrological/erosion variables at both \n\nthe BPS and BES site. As post-fire TN transport results mainly from an increase in the export \n\nof particulate N forms (Soto et al., 1997), one might conclude that the existence of a needle \n\ncover was particularly important for the protection of the easily-erodible solute-enriched ash \n\nlayer, as reported by other authors for the nearby Caramulo Mountains (Ferreira et al., 2005; \n\nShakesby, 2011; Thomas et al., 1999). The fact that a peak in NO3-N concentrations was \n\nobserved in both eucalypt sites immediately after the first significant post-fire rainfall event \n\nbut not at the pine site seems to corroborate this idea (Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3). Overall, the \n\nneedle cover was effective in reducing soil fertility losses since TN exports represented only \n\n6% of topsoil N stocks at the BPS site as opposed to 15 % at the BES site.  \n\nParent material did not have a significant effect on N losses by overland flow. Even so, \n\nglobal TN exports were higher at the BES site than at the BEG site (Table 3.3). From the \n\nPearson\u2019s correlations presented in Table 3.4, the hydrological/erosion variables governing \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n58 \n\nTN export were the same at the BES and BEG slopes. Therefore, one might hypothesize that \n\nthe differences between these two sites were most likely related with the coarser texture of \n\nthe granite soils (Table 3.1), which was also reported by Wahren et al. (2016) for the study \n\nregion. A coarser texture can be expected to increase water infiltration and reduce runoff, \n\nparticularly at the micro-plot scale (Boix-Fayos et al., 2006; Shakesby, 2011). This seems to \n\nbe supported by the work of Wahren et al. (2016) since lower annual runoff coefficients were \n\nreported for Hydrological Response Units (HRU\u2019s) with shallow soils derived from granite \n\nthan from schist. As a result, lower amounts of overland flow and lesser sediment losses were \n\ngenerated at the BEG site, ultimately leading to lower TN exports. The fact that the TN losses \n\nrepresented twice as much of the topsoil N stock at the BES site (15 %) than at the BEG site \n\n(7%) also seems to support the idea that erosion by water was the main factor explaining the \n\ndifferences between granite and schist soils (Table 3.2 and Table 3.3). \n\nIn the case of NO3-N, on the other hand, differences in global exports were minimal \n\nbetween granite and schist soils (Table 3.3). As larger amounts of overland flow were \n\ngenerated at the BES than BEG site, and as overland flow had a strong influence on NO3-N \n\nexport at both sites (Table 3.4), one might hypothesize that the lower topsoil organic matter \n\ncontent at the BES site (Table 3.1) influenced the availability of inorganic N forms in soils, by \n\nlimiting mineralization processes (Caon et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2000b). \n\n3.4.3 Nitrogen concentrations in overland flow \n\nNitrogen concentrations in overland flow exhibited a very distinct variation pattern than \n\nN losses (Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3). Unlike N exports, peaks in N concentrations were not \n\nclearly associated with the major runoff events (Figs. 2 and 3). In fact, almost all plots \n\nexhibited a marked peak in NO3-N and TN concentrations during the first significant post-fire \n\nrainfall event. These peaks probably reflected the detachment and transport of the N \n\nenriched, easily erodible ash layer and of the partially combusted organic material on the \n\nground surface, as also suggested by previous studies in the region (Ferreira et al., 2005, \n\n2008; Thomas et al., 1999). No such peak, however, was found for NO3-N concentrations at \n\nthe BPS site but this could be explained by the post-fire needle cast providing a protective \n\ncover to the solute-enriched ash layer (Ferreira et al., 2005; Shakesby, 2011; Thomas et al., \n\n1999). \n\nAs the ash layer became exhausted and erosion started to affect the topsoil, peaks in TN \n\nconcentrations were mainly associated with major rainfall events, as a result of peaks in \n\noverland flow and associated sediment losses (Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3). In contrast, peaks \n\nin NO3-N concentrations were often unrelated to rainfall events, possibly because nitrification \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n59 \n\nprocesses are largely dependent on microbial activity (Bad\u00eda, 2000; Caon et al., 2014; Murphy \n\net al., 2006). \n\n3.5 Conclusions \n\nThe present study focused on post-fire nitrogen mobilization by overland flow at the \n\nmicro-plot scale. The fact that this work was carried out in the Mediterranean region is \n\nimportant for anticipating the impacts of recurrent fires on soil productivity because fire \n\nfrequency is expected to increase in the future as a result of climate changes.  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe main findings of the present work were that:  \n\n \n\ni) the existence of a protective litter layer (i.e. of scorched pine needles) at the burnt pine \n\nsite considerably reduced post-fire N export compared to the burnt eucalypt site, mainly by \n\ndecreasing overland flow generation and the associated sediment losses. This information \n\ncan be considered relevant for post-fire land management since it emphasizes that \n\nspontaneous mulching can be highly effective to reduce soil (fertility) losses and, thereby, will \n\nmake further soil conservation measures superfluous.   \n\n \n\n ii) overland flow and soil (fertility) losses were markedly lower at the eucalypt site on \n\ngranite than at that at the eucalypt site on schist, probably due to the coarser texture and, \n\nthus, higher infiltration capacity of the granite soils. This parent material-related difference in \n\npost-fire erosion risk is important for defining priorities in post-fire land management and, in \n\nparticular, for the application of soil conservation measures such as mulching.  \n\n \n\nThe results of this study must nonetheless be interpreted with some caution because \n\nmicro-plots may not fully represent post-fire hydrological and erosive processes at the field \n\nscale, which is the key management unit in north-central Portugal due to the reduced size of \n\nland properties. \n\nFurthermore, the lack of data from pre-fire or unburnt sites prevents the assessment of \n\nfire effects on N losses by overland flow, so this work only provides estimates of the range of \n\nN exports in a fire-prone landscape. \n\nEven so, the present findings are viewed as an important contribution to the current \n\nknowledge of post-fire nutrient mobilization and redistribution and of the resulting soil \n\ndegradation in the Mediterranean Basin, especially since such information continues to be \n\nscarce for this region and since Mediterranean soils are typically nutrient poor. \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n60 \n\nFuture studies are, however, recommended to address broader spatial scales as well as \n\nwider time scales to fully understand post-fire nutrient dynamics. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe present work was carried out in the framework of the FIRECNUTS project \n\n(PTDC/AGRCFL/104559/2008), funded by the FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC) through CESAM \n\n(UID/AMB/50017/2013), with co-funding by FEDER through COMPETE (Programa \n\nOperacional Factores de Competitividade; POFC), and with support of the research grants \n\nattributed by FCT/MCTES (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia/Minist\u00e9rio da Ci\u00eancia, da \n\nTecnologia e Ensino Superior, Portugal) to Raquel Vasconcelos Ferreira \n\n(SFRH/BD/45778/2008), Dalila Serpa (SFRH/BPD/92650/2013) and Mar\u00eda Luz Rodr\u00edguez-\n\nBlanco (SFRH/BPD/90640/2012).

Research on fire-\n\naffected areas has given more attention to sediment losses by fire-enhanced overland flow \n\nthan to nutrient exports, especially in the Mediterranean region. To address this knowledge \n\ngap for post-fire losses of phosphorus (P) by overland flow, a recently burnt forest area in \n\nnorth-central Portugal was selected and instrumented immediately after a wildfire. Three \n\nslopes were selected for their contrasting forest types (eucalypt vs. pine) and parent \n\nmaterials (granite vs. schist). The selected study sites were a eucalypt site on granite (BEG), a \n\neucalypt site on schist (BES) and a maritime pine site on schist (BPS). Micro-plots were \n\nmonitored over a period of six months, i.e. till the construction of terraces for reforestation \n\nobliged to the removal of the plots. During this 6-month period, overland flow samples were \n\ncollected at 1- to 2-weekly intervals, depending on rainfall. Total P and PO4-P losses differed \n\nmarkedly between the two types of forests on schist, being lower at the pine site than at the \n\neucalypt site, probably due to the presence of a protective layer of pine needle cast. Parent \n\nmaterial did not play an important role in PO4-P losses by overland flow but it did in TP \n\nlosses, with significantly lower values at the eucalypt site on granite than that on schist. \n\nThese differences in TP losses can be attributed to the coarser texture of granite soils, \n\ntypically promoting infiltration and decreasing runoff. The present findings provided further \n\ninsights into the spatial and temporal patterns of post-fire soil fertility losses in fire-prone \n\nforest types during the initial stages of the window-of-disturbance, which can be useful for \n\ndefining post-fire emergency measures to reduce the risk of soil fertility losses. \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n68 \n\nKeywords \n\nWildfire, Micro-Plot Scale, Overland Flow, Phosphorus Export, Forest type, Parent \n\nmaterial \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nWildfires are a widespread phenomenon, acting as a major driver of ecosystem change \n\nall over the world (Caon et al., 2014; Coombs and Melack, 2013; Doerr and Cerd\u00e0, 2005; \n\nKugbe et al., 2014; Lane et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2014a; Tsibart et al., 2014; Wang et al., \n\n2015).  \n\nIn the Mediterranean region, wildfires have affected increasingly large areas of land \n\nthroughout the past decades (Pausas et al., 2008). This trend is expected to continue, \n\nespecially since projections of future climate change foresee rising temperatures and \n\nincreasing risks of drought spells in this fire-prone region (Anaya-Romero et al., 2015; Blake \n\net al., 2010; Caon et al., 2014). While wildfires are a natural disturbance in many ecosystems, \n\nmore frequent fires and more severe fires can offset the ecological balance of the ecosystems \n\nand have a significant negative impact on soil fertility, soil biological diversity as well as on \n\nthe water cycle (Caon et al., 2014; Crouch et al., 2006; Malvar et al., 2015a).  \n\nSoil fertility is particularly affected by recurrent wildfires because the heating-induced \n\nchanges in soil physical, chemical and biological properties deeply affect the biogeochemical \n\ncycles of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (Caon et al., 2014; Certini, 2005; Knoepp et al., \n\n2005; Shakesby, 2011). \n\nIn the case of phosphorus, the combustion of vegetation as well as of litter by fire \n\nfrequently produces a layer of P-enriched ash and charcoal that can be easily lost by leaching \n\ninto the soil and/or lost by wind or water erosion (Bod\u00ed et al., 2011, 2014; Johnson et al., \n\n2007; Pereira et al., 2014a, 2014b). Also the P pool of the topsoil itself can be markedly \n\naffected by fire since heating promotes the mineralization of topsoil organic matter and, \n\nthereby, the release of inorganic P (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Certini, 2005; Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992). \n\nThe fate of inorganic P following fire depends strongly on pre- and post-fire soil properties \n\n(Certini, 2005; Murphy et al., 2006). In acidic soils, inorganic P tends to adsorb to newly \n\nformed Al, Fe and Mn oxides and hydroxides (Certini, 2005; Murphy et al., 2006; Otero et al., \n\n2015), whereas in neutral or alkaline soils it especially binds to Ca-minerals or precipitates as \n\nCa phosphate (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Certini, 2005; Murphy et al., 2006). Nonetheless, P \n\nsorption/desorption processes are highly dynamic (Otero et al., 2015), so even small changes \n\nin soil pH as often observed after fire can easily cause desorption of inorganic P from metal \n\noxides or calcium compounds formed immediately after fire (Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992; \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n69 \n\nMurphy et al., 2006). As the topsoil P reservoir is depleted by fire-enhanced overland flow \n\nand erosion (Caon et al., 2014; Certini, 2005; Ferreira et al., 2005; Pausas et al., 2008; \n\nShakesby, 2011; Thomas et al., 1999, 2000a, 2000b), and P is exported in both its dissolved \n\nand particulate forms, there can be a loss of soil fertility (Caon et al., 2014; Johnson et al., \n\n2007; Knoepp et al., 2005; Neary et al., 1999; Soto et al., 1997).  \n\nIn the Mediterranean Basin, the effects of fire on soil P availability have been addressed \n\nby various studies (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Caon et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2007; Kutiel and \n\nShaviv, 1992; Otero et al., 2015). Post-fire losses of P by overland flow, however, have been \n\npoorly investigated (Cancelo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013; DeBano et al., 1998; D\u00edaz-Fierros et al., \n\n1990; Lasanta and Cerd\u00e0, 2005). In Portugal, particularly few studies have measured post-fire \n\nP export by overland flow (Coelho et al., 2004; Ferreira et al., 1997, 2005; Thomas et al., 1999, \n\n2000a, 2000b; Walsh et al., 1992), especially considering the more than 100.000 ha that are \n\nburnt each year. These prior studies investigated P losses for the two principal forest types in \n\nnorth-central Portugal, i.e. plantations of eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and maritime \n\npine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) but at larger spatial scales than in the present work, i.e. 16 m2 plots \n\n(Ferreira et al., 1997, 2005; Thomas et al., 2000a, 2000b; Walsh et al., 1992), small (Ferreira \n\net al., 1997, 2005) and large catchments (Santos et al., 2015a, 2015b). Perhaps more \n\nimportantly, these prior studies only addressed soluble P losses and not total P losses (i.e. \n\nsolute + particulate fraction). Hence, a better understanding of overall losses of nutrients \n\nafter fire, in both dissolved and particulate forms, is required for a more accurate assessment \n\nof the risks of post-fire soil fertility losses and its possible impacts on forest recovery.  \n\nThe present study aims to address this knowledge gap by determining the exports of \n\ntotal phosphorus (TP) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (PO4-P) by post-fire overland flow \n\nin a recently burnt forest area in the Mediterranean. The current work, however, does not \n\nquantify the effects of fire on P losses since comparable but long unburnt could not be found \n\nin the vicinity of the study sites. Instead it intends to compare these losses for different \n\ncombinations of forest type and parent material. To this end, TP and PO4-P losses by \n\noverland flow were quantified at the micro-plot scale for: i) two contrasting forest types, i.e. \n\neucalypt and maritime pine plantations, which dominate the north-central Portuguese \n\nmountains and are both fire-prone; and ii) two contrasting bedrock types, i.e. schist and \n\ngranite, which are the prevailing parent materials in north-central Portugal. Phosphorus \n\nlosses by overland flow were further compared with their stock in the ash and upper soil \n\nlayer, for a better appreciation of the relevance of these losses for the P cycle following fire.  \n\nAs all three study sites were (partially) terraced with a bulldozer 6 months after the fire, \n\ncompletely changing the topography of the terrain (Martins et al., 2013), the present work \n\nwas forcedly limited to the immediate post-fire period. \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n70 \n\n \n\n4.2 Materials and Methods \n\n4.2.1 Study area and sites \n\nThe study area was located within the Vouga River Basin, near the Ermida village in the \n\nSever do Vouga municipality, north-central Portugal (Figure 4.1). Between July 26 and July 28 \n\n2010 a wildfire consumed a total of 295 ha of forest in this area (DUDF, 2011). Before the fire, \n\nthe Ermida study area was covered predominantly by commercial eucalypt plantations \n\n(Eucalyptus globulus Labil.) but also included some maritime pine stands (Pinus pinaster Ait.). \n\nFire severity was classified as moderate, because ashes were predominantly black, the litter \n\nlayer and understory vegetation were almost completely consumed by the fire and tree \n\ncrowns were only partially combusted (Table 4.1; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.1 - Location of the Ermida study area within the Vouga River basin, north-central Portugal. \n\nLocation of the study sites: BEG \u2014 burnt eucalypt-granite site, BES \u2014 burnt eucalypt schist site, and \n\nBPS \u2014 burnt pine-schist site.

The mean annual \n\ntemperature at the nearest climate station (Castelo-Burg\u00e3es: 40\u00b051?10?N, 8\u00b0 22?44?W at 306 \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n72 \n\nm a.s.l.; 15 km north of the study area) was 14.9 \u00b0C (1991\u20132011; SNIRH, 2011), with average \n\nmonthly temperatures ranging from 8.9 \u00b0C in January to 21 \u00b0C in July. Annual rainfall at the \n\nnearest rainfall station (Ribeiradio: 40\u00b044?12?N, 8\u00b018?03?W at 228 m a.s.l.; 5 km east of the \n\nstudy area) was, on average, 1655 mm, but varied markedly between dry (960 mm) and wet \n\n(2530 mm) years (1991\u20132011; SNIRH, 2011). \n\nThe study area is part of the Hesperic Massif, a physiographic unit that is dominated by \n\npre-Ordovician schists and greywackes but locally includes Hercynian granites (Pereira and \n\nFitzPatrick, 1995). The soils are mapped as Humic Cambisols (1:1000000; Cardoso et al., \n\n1973), but according to a field survey carried out on January 2011, soils ranged from Humic \n\nLeptosols to Humic Cambisols at the eucalypt sites, and from Lithic Leptosols to Humic \n\nLeptosols at the pine site (IUSS, 2006). The topsoil (0-2 cm) at the study sites was rather \n\ncoarse, with a loam to sandy-clay loam texture, and high (19\u201329%) organic matter content \n\n(Table 4.1). \n\n4.2.2 Experimental set-up, field data and sample collection \n\nWithin the burnt area, three hill slopes were selected for their contrasting forest types \n\nand parent materials, i.e. Burnt Eucalypt on Granite (BEG) vs. Burnt Eucalypt Schist (BES) vs. \n\nBurnt Pine on Schist (BPS) (Table 4.1). \n\nAt each site, a baseline experimental design was implemented which comprised dividing \n\nit into two strips running from the base to the top of the slope section. One of these strips was \n\nused for repeated collection of soil samples and another for monitoring overland flow at the \n\nmicro-plot scale. A necessary limitation of this work was that samples and plots within each \n\nslope were treated as replicates. Although this can be considered as a form of pseudo-\n\nreplication, this is typically difficult to avoid in wildfire studies (Hurlbert, 1984; van Mantgem \n\net al., 2001), due to the impossibility to find three or more slopes that are similar enough (in \n\nterms of land cover, parent material, terrain characteristics and fire severity) to be \n\nconsidered replicate sites. \n\nSoil sampling was limited to the topsoil (0-2 cm depth) since moderate fires are widely \n\nknown for affecting mainly the upper 2 cm of soil (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Zavala et al., 2014). \n\nSampling was performed on 2 occasions: on August 10 2010, approximately two weeks after \n\nthe wildfire and before any post-fire rainfall occurrence; and on February 16 2011, \n\nimmediately before the start of the bench terracing. At the first occasion, ash samples were \n\ncollected along with soil samples. At both occasions ash and/or soil sampling was done at five \n\nequally-distant points along a transect that was laid out from the base to the top of the slope \n\nsection. At each point of the transect ashes were collected over an area of 0.25 m2 (0.5 m \u00d7 0.5 \n\nm) and topsoil (0-2 cm depth) over an area of 0.06 m2 (0.25 m \u00d7 0.25 m). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n73 \n\n \n\nThe study sites were instrumented with overland flow plots on August 25 2010, before \n\nthe occurrence of any post-fire rainfall. This involved the installation, at the base of the slope \n\nsection, of three bounded micro-plots of approximately 0.28 m2, at distances of 1-2 m from \n\neach other. The outlets of the micro-plots were connected to high density polyethylene \n\nbarrels to collect overland flow. The placement of the micro-plots at the bottom of the slope \n\nsection was done to facilitate access and, thus, field measurements and runoff sample \n\ncollection as well as to minimize disturbance which was a concern since the sites were \n\nlocated within an experimental catchment (Keizer et al., 2015). From August 2010 to \n\nFebruary 2011, overland flow was measured at 1- to 2-weekly intervals, depending on the \n\noccurrence of rainfall. Whenever the overland flow in a barrel exceeded 250 mL, a sample \n\nwas collected in a 500 mL polyethylene bottle that had been previously rinsed with \n\nhydrochloric acid (pH &lt;2.0), and distilled and deionized water. The samples were then \n\ntransported to the laboratory in cool boxes and stored at 4\u00baC for no longer than 24 h before \n\nlaboratory analysis. \n\n4.2.3 Laboratory analyses \n\nUpon arrival to the laboratory, the ash and soil samples were air dried and then sieved \n\nmanually with a 2 mm sieve. Available phosphorus (Pav) content in ash and soils was \n\ndetermined by the Bray method (Bray and Kurtz, 1945), using a mixture of ammonium \n\nfluoride (0.03 M) and hydrochloric acid (0.025 M) as extractant. The extracted P was \n\nanalyzed spectrophotometrically as orthophosphate by the molybdenum blue method (APHA, \n\n1998). Soil samples were also analysed for: i) soil particle size, following the international \n\nmethod of mechanical analysis as defined by Guiti\u00e1n and Carballas (1976); and ii) organic \n\nmatter content, which was determined by loss on ignition at 550\u00baC for 4 h, as described by \n\nBotelho da Costa (2004). In addition, bulk density of the upper 5 cm of soil was determined \n\nusing the core method, as described by Porta et al. (2003). \n\nOverland flow samples were analysed for total phosphorus (i.e. dissolved plus \n\nparticulate P forms) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus, i.e. orthophosphate (PO4-P). This \n\nwas done using a flow injection FIAstarTM 5000 analyser (FOSS \u2013 Tecator). Prior to analysis, \n\n50 mL subsamples for determining PO4-P concentrations were filtered with 0.45 ?m \n\nMillipore\u00a9 membrane filters. Subsamples (50 mL) for analysing TP, on the other hand, were \n\nfirst subjected to an oxidative digestion, using peroxodisulphate/alkali (Oxisolv\u00ae, Merck), \n\nand then filtered. The concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) of the overland flow \n\nsamples was quantified gravimetrically through filtration of 50-150 mL of runoff by a glass \n\nfibre filter, followed by drying to a constant weight at 105 \u00baC (APHA, 1998). \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n74 \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Data analysis \n\nAvailable phosphorus (Pav) contents of ash and topsoil samples were compared for the \n\nsites with contrasting forest types (BES vs. BPS) and for the sites with contrasting parent \n\nmaterials (BEG vs. BES) by means of a one-way ANOVA followed by a multi-comparison \n\nTukey\u2019s test. The underlying assumptions of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and homogeneity \n\nof variance (Levene\u2019s test) were explicitly tested and, if one or both were rejected, data were \n\nlogarithmically transformed prior to the analysis (Zar, 1999). \n\nPhosphorus exports by overland flow were also analysed by a one-way ANOVA followed \n\nby a Tukey\u2019s test, and the same was true for overland flow amounts as well as for sediment \n\nlosses. The influence of environmental variables (rainfall amount and intensity, overland flow \n\nand sediment losses) on P losses by overland flow was assessed by the Pearson\u2019s correlation \n\ncoefficient (Zar, 1999). In the case of the variables that had not met the normality \n\nassumption, these coefficients were computed for logarithmically transformed data.  \n\nAll statistical analyses were performed with SigmaPlot 11.0 package software, while \n\ntesting was done at a significance level of 0.05. \n\n4.3 Results \n\n4.3.1 Phosphorus contents in ash and topsoil \n\nThe average contents of Pav in the ash and topsoil layers of the three study sites are \n\nshown in Table 4.2. No significant differences (ANOVA: F = 0.531, p = 0.594) were observed \n\nbetween the ashes collected at sites with contrasting forest types (BES vs. BPS) or with \n\ncontrasting parent materials (BEG vs. BES). The Pav contents of ash at the two eucalypt sites \n\n(BEG: 0.5 mg g-1, BES: 0.4 mg g-1; Table 2), however, were on average 3 to 6 times lower than \n\nthose of the topsoil (BEG: 1.7 mg g-1, BES: 2.6 mg g-1; Table 4.2). In contrast at the pine site \n\n(BPS), Pav contents were similar for ash (0.3 mg g-1) and soils (0.2 mg g-1). \n\nUnlike for the ash layer, the topsoil of the two types of tree plantations on schist (BES \n\nand BPS) differed significantly in Pav contents (Table 2). This was true immediately after the \n\nfire, in August 2010 (ANOVA: F = 4.980, p = 0.027; Tukey\u2019s test: p = 0.022) as well as six \n\nmonths later, in February 2011 (ANOVA: F = 20.181, p &lt;0.001; Tukey\u2019s test: p &lt;0.001).

Forest type \n\nappeared to play a differential role in TP exports, as they were strongly correlated with \n\nrainfall amount at the eucalypt site (BES: r = 0.85) but not at the pine site (BPS: r = 0.32). The \n\nimportance of forest type was also suggested in the case of PO4-P exports but in the opposite \n\nsense. PO4-P exports were strongly correlated to sediment losses at the pine site (BPS: r = \n\n0.78) but not at the eucalypt site (BES: r = 0.42). The relation of PO4-P exports with sediment \n\nlosses also differed for the two eucalypt sites with contrasting parent materials. At the \n\neucalypt site on granite, PO4-P exports were strongly correlated to sediment losses (BEG: r = \n\n0.80), unlike at the schist site (BES: r = 0.42). \n\n4.3.4 Environmental variables and post-fire phosphorus exports \n\nThe temporal patterns of orthophosphate (PO4-P) and total phosphorus (TP) \n\nconcentrations in overland flow during the first 6 months after the wildfire are presented in \n\nFigure 4.3. A clear peak in TP concentrations was found for the first significant post-fire \n\nrainfall event at all three study sites. In the subsequent period, TP concentrations varied \n\nconsiderably and these variations agreed better with the temporal patterns in sediment \n\nconcentrations than in rainfall amounts or runoff volumes (Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3.). \n\nDifferences in average TP concentrations between the three study sites were rather \n\nconsistent throughout the study period. TP concentrations tended to be highest at the \n\neucalypt site on schist (BES), lowest at the pine site on schist (BPS) and intermediate at the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n79 \n\neucalypt site on granite (BEG), in agreement with the differences in global TP exports (Table \n\n4.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 - Average orthophosphate (PO4-P), total phosphorus (TP) and sediment concentrations in \n\noverland flow, within the first 6 months after fire. BEG \u2013 eucalypt-granite site; BES \u2013 eucalypt-schist \n\nsite and BPS \u2013 pine-schist site. \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe average PO4-P concentrations showed quite different temporal patterns than the \n\naverage TP concentrations. Instead of revealing a single peak, PO4-P concentrations at all \n\nthree sites were highest for the first three significant rainfall events and after early November \n\n2010 tended to decrease with time-since-fire (Figure 4.3). Therefore, PO4-P concentrations \n\nseemed basically unrelated to the temporal patterns in rainfall amounts, runoff volumes or \n\nsediment concentrations (Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3.). The PO4-P concentrations at the pine \n\nsite (BPS) tended to be clearly lower than those of the two eucalypt sites throughout the \n\nstudy period (Figure 4.3). The differences in PO4-P concentrations between the two eucalypt \n\nsites were less straightforward, with a tendency for higher values at the site on schist (BES) \n\nthan on granite (BES). \n\n4.4 Discussion \n\n4.4.1 Phosphorus contents in ash and topsoil \n\nThe ashes collected at sites with contrasting types of vegetation (BES vs. BPS) did not \n\npresent significantly different Pav contents. As fire severity was classified as moderate at both \n\nsites (Table 4.1), the comparable ash contents could be explained by similar pre-fire P \n\ncontents in vegetation and litter layers at both sites. This hypothesis is supported by the fact \n\nthat similar P levels have indeed been found in northern Portugal, not just for eucalypt leaves \n\nand pine needles but also for litter and even for the organic matter-rich soil horizons of \n\nunburnt eucalypt and maritime pine stands (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2011; Nunes et al., 2010; \n\nRibeiro et al., 2002). \n\nAsh Pav contents also did not differ significantly between the two study sites with \n\ncontrasting parent material (BEG vs. BES). This agreed with the similar P levels that \n\nMagalh\u00e3es et al. (2011) reported for the organic horizons of unburnt soils on granite and \n\nschist in the study region.  \n\nThe Pav contents of the ashes at the two eucalypt sites were, on average, lower than the \n\ncontents of the topsoil (Table 4.2). This was to be expected as the soil tends to be the \n\npredominant P pool (94 \u2013 98%) and not the litter or vegetation (Neary et al., 1999). At the \n\npine site, however, the Pav content was slightly higher in the ashes than in the topsoil. This \n\ncould be due to the dissolution of Ca2+ ions from the Ca2+ enriched pine ash (Machado et al., \n\n2015), which most likely promoted the precipitation of Pav in the soil as calcium phosphate \n\n(Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2000b). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n81 \n\nThe Pav contents of the topsoil differed significantly between the two forest types \n\nimmediately after the fire (Table 4.2). This difference presumably reflected a difference in the \n\nP topsoil content that existed before the wildfire, since fire severity was classified as \n\nmoderate at both sites. An explanation for higher topsoil Pav content at the eucalypt site (BES) \n\nthan at the pine site (BPS) would be a higher soil organic matter (SOM) content at the \n\neucalypt site (22 vs. 19 %; Table 4.1). Fire-induced heating might have promoted SOM \n\nmineralization (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014), thereby increasing Pav contents in the topsoil. On the other \n\nhand, SOM might have also influenced P adsorption and desorption processes (Kang et al., \n\n2011; Otero et al., 2015). SOM can both enhance the amount of P sorbed by metal-chelate \n\nbinding and inhibit P sorption, through competition of organic anions for P adsorption sites \n\nand also by increasing the negative charge of the topsoil (Kang et al., 2011). \n\nThe topsoil Pav contents immediately after the wildfire did not differ significantly with \n\nparent material (Table 4.2). This lack of a significant difference between the BEG and BES \n\nsites agreed with the similar P contents that were found for unburnt soils derived from \n\ngranite and from schist in the study region (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2011). The Pav contents at the \n\ntwo eucalypt sites decreased dramatically (more than 90%) between August 2010 and \n\nFebruary 2011 (Table 4.2), possibly as a result of P losses by runoff and soil erosion (Caon et \n\nal., 2014; Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2008; Certini, 2005; Khanna et al., 1994; Knoepp et al., 2005; \n\nPausas et al., 2008; Shakesby, 2011; Thomas et al., 1999). In agreement with this explanation, \n\nTP exports were inversely related with decreases in topsoil P contents for the two eucalypt \n\nsites, with the site on schist exhibiting larger exports as well as decreases in topsoil content \n\n(TP exports: 0.85 g m-2; Soil Pav losses: 2.5 mg g-1) than the site on granite (TP exports: 0.25 g \n\nm-2; Soil Pav losses: 1.6 mg g-1). As P cycling is mainly ensured through the organic P pools, the \n\nremoval of vegetation and litter by fire combined with soil erosion could have led to the \n\nexhaustion of above and belowground P pools at a pace higher than mineral weathering could \n\nreplace it (DeBano and Klopatek, 1988; Neary et al., 1999). \n\nIn contrast to the two eucalypt sites, the pine site (BPS) revealed an increase in topsoil \n\nPav content with time-since-fire (Table 4.2). This could be related to changes in soil pH that \n\npromoted the re-dissolution of calcium phosphate precipitates formed immediately after fire \n\n(Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992) as well as to the decomposition of the pine needle cast from the \n\npartially scorched tree crowns, since the breakdown of organic matter constitutes a major \n\nsource of Pav (Ribeiro et al., 2007). Worth stressing in this respect were the lower TP exports \n\nand sediment losses at the pine site than at the two eucalypt sites. \n\nAt the end of this study, and in agreement to what was found immediately after the fire \n\n(Table 4.2), significant differences in topsoil P contents were found among sites with distinct \n\ntypes of vegetation (BES vs. BPS) but not among sites with distinct types of parent material \n\n(BEG vs. BES), which might suggest that soil processes were still under the influence of the \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n82 \n\n\u201cwindow of disturbance\u201d (Ferreira et al., 2005, 2008; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). Longer \n\nstudies are therefore needed for a better knowledge of post-fire P cycling for the full duration \n\nof the \u201cwindow of disturbance\u201d (Ferreira et al., 2005, 2008; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Phosphorus exports by overland flow \n\nAt all three forest sites, clear peaks in P exports \u2013 both PO4-P and TP \u2013 occurred mainly \n\nassociated to the major rainfall events, as would be expected since these events generated the \n\nlargest amounts of runoff and sediment losses (Figure 4.2; Table 4.4). These findings are in \n\nline with what has been reported by various authors for other recently burnt areas in the \n\nMediterranean region (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Soto et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 1999, 2000b).  \n\nWhen comparing the two sites with different types of vegetation, global PO4-P and TP \n\nexports were found to be significantly higher at the eucalypt than at the pine site on schist \n\n(Table 4.3). This could be explained by the typically stronger soil water repellency in eucalypt \n\nstands than in pine stands in the study region (Doerr et al., 1998; Keizer et al., 2005a, b; \n\nSantos et al., 2013), which was likely to have promoted overland flow and the associated \n\nsediment and P losses at the BES site. The possible existence of a water repellent ash layer \n\noverlying a strongly to extremely repellent topsoil at the BES site could have enhanced the \n\ndifferences in runoff and erosion between the eucalypt and pine sites (Bod\u00ed et al., 2011, 2014; \n\nDlapa et al., 2013; Malvar et al., 2015b). An alternative explanation would be the needle cast \n\ncover, due to spontaneous mulching from the partially scorched pine crowns, reducing \n\noverland flow and erosion at the BPS site (Table 4.3) as also reported by prior post-fire \n\nerosion studies (Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2008; Knoepp et al., 2005; Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992). This \n\npine needle cast was also held responsible for limiting the export of other nutrients such as \n\nnitrogen (Ferreira et al., 2015) and base cations (Machado et al., 2015) at the same study site, \n\nattesting to the importance of an effective mulch cover against soil fertility losses. The \n\neffectiveness of needle cast has mainly been attributed to the increases in interception \n\nstorage and resistance to flow and the reduction in splash erosion (Martins et al., 2013; Prats \n\net al., 2012, 2013; Shakesby et al., 1996; Thomas et al., 2000a, b). The resulting decreases in \n\nexports of particulate P forms as well as soil particles in general might explain the weak \n\ncorrelation that was observed between TP losses and rainfall amounts at the pine site (r = \n\n0.32) as opposed to at the eucalypt site (r = 0.85).  \n\nWhen comparing the two eucalypt plantations with contrasting types of parent material, \n\nsignificant lower TP losses were found at the site on granite than on schist (Table 4.3). As the \n\ncomposition of the ash layer was similar at the two sites (Table 4.1 ; Ferreira et al., 2015; \n\nMachado et al., 2015) on one hand, and on the other, as its thickness was twice as great at the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n83 \n\nBES (1 cm) than at the BEG site (0.5 cm), which would expectedly reduce overland flow and \n\nsediment yields (Bod\u00ed et al., 2011; Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Le\u00f3n et al., 2013), it is unlikely that the \n\nash layer was responsible for the differences in P exports between the two eucalypt \n\nplantations. An alternative explanation, would be the coarser texture of the granite soils \n\n(Table 4.1), since a coarse texture has been reported to increase infiltration and, thus, reduce \n\nrunoff (Wahren et al., 2016), particularly at the micro-plot scale (Boix-Fayos et al., 2006; \n\nShakesby, 2011). In fact, the plots at the eucalypt site on granite did generate lower amounts \n\nof overland flow and associated sediment losses than those at the eucalypt site of schist \n\n(Table 4.3). These lower runoff and erosion rates were not only associated with lower \n\nexports of TP but also with significantly lower exports of total N (Ferreira et al., 2015) and \n\nbase cations, namely Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+ (Machado et al., 2015). PO4-P exports were also \n\nlower at the eucalypt site on granite than on schist but not in a significant manner (Table 4.3). \n\nThis contrast between TP and PO4-P results might reflect a prevailing role of sediment losses \n\nin TP exports as opposed to a predominant role of runoff volumes in PO4-P exports, since \n\nsignificant differences in sediment losses but not in overland flow were found between the \n\nBEG and BES site (Table 4.3). Such findings are also in line with the fact that inorganic P \n\nforms are mostly lost in solution rather than adsorbed to sediment particles (Thomas et al., \n\n1999, 2000b).  \n\nThe comparison of the present results with those of Ferreira et al. (2015) on nitrogen \n\nlosses by overland flow at the same study sites showed that P solutes were preferentially lost \n\nover N solutes at all three sites, which suggests that P is more likely to become a limiting \n\nfactor for vegetation recovery following fire than N. Moreover, global TP losses were higher \n\nthan TN losses at one of the study sites (BES) but not at the other two sites (BEG and BPS), so \n\nthe risk of decline in overall soil fertility would seem highest at the BES site. Besides the \n\nerosion risk per se, the risk of soil fertility decline at this site would seem relevant for \n\ndefining post-fire erosion mitigation measures. However, further studies over longer time \n\nscales are required to confirm these results, especially since major changes to soil hydrology \n\nand erodibility can occur over the medium to long-term (Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005; Cerd\u00e0 and \n\nLasanta, 2005), in turn influencing post-fire nutrient losses. \n\n4.4.3 Phosphorus concentrations in overland flow \n\nPhosphorus concentrations and exports by overland flow showed a distinctive variation \n\npattern in time (Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3). Unlike exports, peaks in PO4-P and TP \n\nconcentrations were not associated in a clear manner with the major rainfall or overland flow \n\nevents. The first 3 significant post-fire rainfall events produced marked peaks in PO4-P \n\nconcentrations at the two eucalypt sites but clearly lower peaks at the pine site, suggesting \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n84 \n\nthat the pine needle cover provided effective protection against the transport of the solute-\n\nenriched ash layer which is typically easily erodible (Ferreira et al., 2005; Shakesby, 2011; \n\nThomas et al., 1999). After the preferential erosion of the ash layer at the eucalypt sites \n\n(around November 2010), PO4-P concentrations seemed unrelated to rainfall or overland \n\nflow events, possibly due to the complex biogeochemical processes involving this form of P \n\n(Certini, 2005; Kutiel and Shaviv, 1992; Murphy et al., 2006).  \n\nPeaks in TP concentrations also differed from the peaks in TP exports (Figure 4.2 and \n\nFigure 4.3). At all the study sites, TP concentrations were clearly highest during the first \n\nsignificant post-fire rainfall event, most likely as a consequence of the detachment and \n\ntransport of the easily erodible ash layer and of the partially combusted organic material on \n\nthe ground surface, as was also suggested by other authors for the study region (Ferreira et \n\nal., 2005, 2008; Thomas et al., 1999). After this first rainfall event, less pronounced peaks in \n\nTP concentrations seemed mainly associated to the largest erosion events (Figure 4.3), as \n\nwould be expected since TP consists mostly of particulate P forms (Sharpey et al., 1992). \n\n \n\n4.5 Conclusions \n\nThe present work evaluated post-fire P losses by overland flow at micro-plot scale in a \n\nrecently burnt Mediterranean area, addressing a topic that has until now been investigated \n\nby a rather limited number of studies. The results of this study emphasized the importance of \n\na protective soil layer (in this case, a spontaneous mulch layer of pine needle cast) for \n\nminimizing post-fire P exports. Parent material was also found to play an important role in \n\npost-fire TP losses and, ultimately, for implementing measures against soil fertility losses.  \n\nNonetheless, the results of the current work must be regarded with some caution, \n\nespecially as a basis for post-fire land management, since micro-plots may not be \n\nrepresentative for post-fire hydrological and erosive processes at the field scale. Despite \n\nthese limitations, the present findings are considered an important contribution to a better \n\nunderstanding of the effects of forest type and parent material on post-fire phosphorus \n\nexport in the Mediterranean region. Studies at larger spatial scales (including catchment \n\nscale) as well as over longer periods are highly recommended for a more comprehensive \n\nknowledge of P cycling in recently burnt areas as well as in downstream aquatic systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n85 \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe present work was carried out in the scope of the FIRECNUTS project \n\n(PTDC/AGRCFL/104559/2008) and CESAM (UID/AMB/50017/2013), funded by the \n\nFCT/MCTES (PIDDAC) with co-funding by FEDER through COMPETE (Programa Operacional \n\nFactores de Competitividade; POFC), and with support of the research grants attributed by \n\nFCT/MCTES (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia/Minist\u00e9rio da Ci\u00eancia, da Tecnologia e \n\nEnsino Superior, Portugal) to Raquel Vasconcelos Ferreira (SFRH/BD/45778/2008) and to \n\nDalila Serpa (SFRH/BPD/92650/2013).

Ferreiraa, D. Serpaa, M.A. Cerqueiraa, J.J. Keizera \n\na University of Aveiro and CESAM \n\nIn preparation to submission, CATENA 2016. \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nWildfires have affected vast areas in Mediterranean forests, triggering changes in \n\ngeomorphological and hydrological processes that can lead to a variety of negative impacts \n\non the ecosystems. Important research gaps, however, remain with respect to wildfire \n\nimpacts on runoff, and especially on soil erosion and nutrient mobilization. To address this \n\nresearch gap on post-fire nutrient losses by overland flow, a recently burnt forest area in \n\nnorth-central Portugal was selected and instrumented immediately after a wildfire, to \n\nevaluate the export of dissolved (NO3-N and PO4-P) and total (TN and TP)  nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus forms. Two recently burnt eucalypt plantations were selected for their \n\ncontrasting slope aspect (north vs. south orientation). The selection of only eucalypt slopes \n\nwas mainly influenced by the fact that eucalypt is one of the most important and, at the same \n\ntime, most fire-prone forest type in north-central Portugal. Plots were monitored over a \n\nperiod of twenty months, in which overland flow samples were collected on a 1- to 2-weekly \n\nbasis, depending on rainfall. The north west-facing slope (BE-NW) showed more nutrient \n\nlosses than the one facing south east (BE-SE), probably reflecting the influence of a logging \n\nintervention taken place at the BE-NW slope, shortly before the fire. Nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus exports were particularly pronounced in the three months after fire. However, \n\nafter this initial period, peaks in N and P exports were also observed in association to intense \n\nrainfall events. The present work provided estimates of the range of N and P exports by \n\noverland flow in a recently burnt area at micro-plot scale in a fire-prone landscape of the \n\nMediterranean Basin. It represents an important addition to the studies on post-fire nutrient \n\nlosses by overland flow conducted in this region, with a further insight into the \n\ncomprehension of the processes involved, and particularly useful for anticipating the impacts \n\nof recurrent fires on soil productivity. \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n94 \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nWildfire; Overland flow; Nitrogen loss; Phosphorus loss; Micro-plot; Eucalypt stand; \n\nSlope Aspect \n\n \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nForests in the Mediterranean basin are frequently subject to severe wildfires. As it is \n\ncommonly known, wildfires can change geo-morphological and hydrological processes \n\nthrough their direct effects on vegetation, litter layer and topsoil, as comprehensively \n\nreviewed by Cerd\u00e0 and Bod\u00ed (2007), Moody et al. (2013) and Shakesby (2011). Important \n\nresearch gaps remain, however, with respect to wildfire impacts on runoff, soil erosion, and \n\nespecially on post-fire nutrient mobilization (Shakesby, 2011). \n\nGiven the complexity of soil dynamics under the influence of fire, a better understanding \n\nof spatial and temporal mechanisms occurring in the immediate post-fire period is important \n\nfor defining priorities in post-fire land management to mitigate soil erosion hazards in burnt \n\nsites (Shakesby, 2011). \n\nSlope aspect has been reported to be a determinant factor for the hydrological and \n\nerosive response of forest ecosystems, mainly because it influences the amount of radiation \n\nreceived by the slope, which in turn affects the soil and vegetation properties (Cerd\u00e0, 1998; \n\nKutiel and Lavee, 1999; Sternberg and Shoshany, 2001; Gabarr\u00f3n-Galeote et al., 2013). \n\nForestry practices can also strongly influence overland flow and erosion in recently \n\nburnt areas. Various studies on post-fire management operations showed that logging and \n\nsalvage harvesting (Thomas et al., 2000b; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2011b) can \n\nincrease the risk of soil erosion. \n\nThe importance of nutrient dynamics in overland flow in burnt forest environments is \n\noften disregarded, in spite of their significance for fertility losses at the ecosystem level. In \n\nburnt areas, nutrient loss in solution and adsorbed to eroded sediments were found to be \n\nconsiderably higher than in mature forest stands, as a result of increased overland flow and \n\nerosion amounts, and of the increased nutrient concentrations at the topsoil, as a result of \n\norganic matter combustion during fire (Ferreira et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 1999, 2000a, \n\n2000b). High nutrient availability in overland flow has direct consequences on the \n\necosystems, either due to the decrease in soil fertility (Caon et al., 2014; Certini, 2005; Pausas \n\net al., 2008; Shakesby, 2011) as well as the eutrophication of downstream aquatic systems \n\n(Bowman and Boggs, 2006; Correll, 1998; Smith et al., 2011a). \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n95 \n\nIn wet Mediterranean regions, such as the study area, those nutrient losses strongly \n\naffect soil productivity and the environmental sustainability, since they coincide with \n\nmountain areas where the soils are often weakly developed and nutrient-poor, regardless of \n\nvegetation abundance. The latter is also true in Portugal, where the schist mountain is \n\ngenerally characterized by poorly developed Humic Cambisols where the only nutrient pool \n\nis located at the organic layers, which are burned down by forest fires (Ferreira et al., 2005). \n\nPost-fire nutrient losses by overland flow have been poorly investigated in the \n\nMediterranean (Cancelo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013; DeBano et al., 1998; D\u00edaz-Fierros et al., 1990; \n\nLasanta and Cerd\u00e0, 2005; Machado et al., 2015). In Portugal, in particular, only a small \n\nnumber of studies have measured post-fire nitrogen and phosphorus exports by overland \n\nflow (Coelho et al., 2004; Ferreira et al., 1997, 2005; Thomas et al., 1999, 2000a, 2000b; \n\nWalsh et al., 1992). Prior studies have also only evaluated solute losses and not total nitrogen \n\nlosses (i.e. solute + particulate fraction) by overland flow. The present study aims to address \n\nthis knowledge gap, by evaluating total nitrogen and total phosphorus exports by post-fire \n\noverland flow in a recently burnt area of the western Mediterranean Region. \n\nThe current work does not assess the effects of fire on nitrogen and phosphorus losses \n\nby overland flow since it does not present comparable data from unburnt plantations in the \n\nsurroundings of the burnt area. In turn, the main aim of this study was to provide estimates of \n\nnitrogen and phosphorus exports by overland flow from recently burnt eucalypt plantations, \n\none of the main and, at the same time, most fire-prone forest type in north-central Portugal. \n\nMore specifically, this study wanted to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus exports by overland \n\nflow at the micro-plot scale: (i) for eucalypt plantations with contrasting slope aspects (north \n\nvs. south orientation); (ii) to determine the contributions of dissolved versus particulate \n\nfractions in nutrient exports; and (iii) to understand the spatial and temporal variation \n\npatterns in post-fire N and P losses. These losses were furthermore related to the N and P \n\ncontents of the ash layer and the topsoil, for a better understanding of the N and P cycle \n\nfollowing fire. \n\n5.2 Materials and Methods \n\n5.2.1 Study area and study sites \n\nThe study area was located within the Vouga River Basin, near the Ermida village in the \n\nSever do Vouga municipality, north-central Portugal (Figure 5.1). The area was affected by a \n\nwildfire that took place between July 26 and July 28 2010 and that consumed, in total, some \n\n300 ha of forest (DUDF, 2011). When the fire occurred, the area was predominantly covered \n\nby plantations of eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus Labil.) but did also include some plantations \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n96 \n\nof maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Two contrasting burnt eucalypt (E. globulus) \n\nplantations in steep hill slopes with similar slope angle were selected for the present study by \n\ntheir contrasting aspects, i.e. South-East (BE-SE) and North-West (BE-NW) (Figure 5.1; Table \n\n5.1) \n\nThe climate of the study area can be classified as humid meso-thermal (Csb, according to \n\nthe K\u00f6ppen classification), with moderate but prolonged dry summers (DRA-Centro, 2002). \n\nThe mean annual temperature at the nearest climate station (Castelo-Burg\u00e3es: 40\u00b051?10?N, \n\n8\u00b0 22?44?W at 306 m a.s.l.) was 14.9 \u00b0C (1991\u20132011; SNIRH, 2011), with average monthly \n\ntemperatures ranging from 8.9 \u00b0C in January to 21 \u00b0C in July. Annual rainfall at the nearest \n\nrainfall station (Ribeiradio: 40\u00b073?65?N, 8\u00b030?08?W at 228 m a.s.l.) was, on average, 1655 \n\nmm, but varied markedly between dry (960 mm) and wet (2530 mm) years (1991\u20132011; \n\nSNIRH, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.1 - Location of the Ermida study area within the Vouga River basin, north-central Portugal. \n\nLocation of the study sites: BE-NW \u2014 burnt eucalypt site facing North-West; and BE-SE \u2014 burnt \n\neucalypt site facing South-East.

The parent material in the study area mainly consisted of pre-\n\nOrdovician schists but included Hercynian granites at some locations, as is typical for the \n\nHesperic Massif (Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995). The soils were mapped, at a scale of 1:1 000 \n\n000, as predominantly Humic Cambisols (Cardoso et al., 1973), but field descriptions of soil \n\nprofiles at the study sites revealed that soils are mainly Umbric Leptosols (IUSS, 2006). \n\nThe topsoil (0\u20132 cm) at the study sites was rather coarse, with a sandy-loam to sandy-\n\nclay loam texture and high organic matter content (24\u201325%) (Table 5.1). The bulk density in \n\nthe topsoil (0-5cm depth) tend to be higher at the south-facing slope (BE-SE: 1.15 \u00b1 0.19 \n\ng.cm-3) than at the north-facing slope (BE-NW: 0.88 \u00b1 0.13 g.cm-3) but not in a substantial \n\nmanner. \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n98 \n\nAt both sites, fire severity was classified as moderate (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). Ash \n\ncolour (predominantly black), as well as the degree of tree crown scorching (only partially \n\ncombusted) and litter layer consumption (completely consumed by fire) were used as \n\nindicators. \n\nGround cover descriptions right after the fire revealed that the BE-NW site had 87% of \n\nashes covering the ground whereas the BE-SE showed some 61%. Also stones and litter cover \n\nshowed some discrepancy between the two sites: 1 and 2%, respectively at the BE-NW site \n\nand 22 and 17%, respectively at the BE-SE site. Before the fire, the BE-NW site had a \n\ncommercial logging operation, with clear-cutting of the eucalypt plantation on this slope, with \n\nthe purpose of harvesting wood and maintaining the roots for eucalypt re-sprouting. Possibly, \n\nthe harvesting remains left on the ground (see Prats et al., 2014) were burnt by the fire which \n\ncan explain the differences in ash cover between sites. \n\n5.2.2 Experimental design, field data and sample collection \n\nBoth study sites within the burnt area were divided into two adjacent strips running \n\nfrom the base to the top of the slope section. In one of these strips, two pairs of bounded \n\nmicro-plots (0.25\u20130.30 m2) were installed before the occurrence of post-fire rainfall, one pair \n\nat the base and the other pair halfway up the slope, for monitoring overland flow. The other \n\nstrip was used for repeated collection of soil samples. Samples and plots at each study site \n\nwere treated as independent observations, despite the reduced distances between them, \n\nsince the samples/plots from each of the present study sites exhibit considerable variability. \n\nOnly samples of the topsoil (0-2 cm depth) were collected because moderate fires are \n\nwidely known for affecting mainly the upper 2 cm of soil (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; Cerd\u00e0, 2000; \n\nMataix-Solera et al., 2011; Zavala, 2014). Soil sampling was done first on August 2010, \n\nroughly two weeks after the wildfire and before the occurrence of any rainfall; and then \n\nsampled with a regular interval of six months from that date onward, until after the end of the \n\nmonitoring period (August 2012). At the first sampling event, ash samples were collected \n\nalong with soil samples. Sampling was done at five equally-distant points along a transect \n\nthat was laid out from the base to the top of the slope section, and shifted approximately 1-2 \n\nm across the slope in the subsequent sampling occasion. At each point of the transect ashes \n\nwere collected over an area of 0.25 m2 (0.5 m \u00d7 0.5 m) and topsoil (0-2 cm depth) over an \n\narea of 0.06 m2 (0.25 m \u00d7 0.25 m). \n\nThe overland flow from the micro-plots was collected in barrels of 30 to 70 L. In each \n\nfield trip, overland flow volumes were measured and, whenever the volume in each barrel \n\nexceeded 250 mL, samples were collected, following intensive stirring of the water in the \n\nbarrels. Sampling was done during 20 months after the wildfire, at 1\u20132-weekly intervals, \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n99 \n\ndepending on rainfall. During this period, overland flow samples were collected in 500 mL \n\npolyethylene bottles that had been previously rinsed with hydrochloric acid (pH &lt;2.0) and \n\ndistilled and dionized water. Overland flow samples were then transported to the laboratory \n\nin cool boxes and stored at 4\u00baC for no longer than 24 h. \n\nThe 1- to 2-weekly field trips also involved measurement of rainfall accumulated in 4 \n\nstorage gauges (in-house design) that had been installed across the study area by the middle \n\nof August 2010. Their main purpose, however, was to validate the automatic recordings of \n\ntwo tipping-bucket rainfall gauges (Pronamic Professional Rain Gauge with 0.2 mm \n\nresolution) that had been installed in close proximity to two of the storage gauges. \n\n5.2.3 Laboratory work \n\nUpon arrival to the laboratory, the ash and soil samples were air dried and sieved \n\nmanually with a 2 mm sieve. Total nitrogen content (TKN) in ashes and soils was determined \n\nusing the Kjeldahl method (Bremner, 1979). Available phosphorus (Pav) content in ashes and \n\nsoils was determined by the Bray method (Bray and Kurtz, 1945), using a mixture of \n\nammonium fluoride (0.03 M) and hydrochloric acid (0.025 M) as extractant. The extracted P \n\nwas analyzed spectrophotometrically as ortophosphate by the molybdenum blue method \n\n(APHA, 1998). \n\nAside from nitrogen and phosphorus, soil samples were also analysed for: i) bulk \n\ndensity, using the core method as described by Porta et al. (2003); ii) soil particle size, \n\nfollowing the international method of mechanical analysis as defined by Guiti\u00e1n and Carballas \n\n(1976); and iii) organic matter, determined by loss on ignition at 550\u00baC for 4 h, as described \n\nby Botelho da Costa (2004). \n\nOverland flow samples were analysed for total (i.e. dissolved plus particulate forms) \n\nnitrogen and phosphorus (i.e. dissolved plus particulate P forms), nitrate (NO3-N) and \n\northophosphate (PO4-P), using a flow injection FIAstarTM 5000 analyser (FOSS-Tecator). \n\nPrior to analysis, overland flow subsamples (50 mL) for determining NO3-N and PO4-P \n\nconcentrations were filtered with 0.45 ?m Millipore\u00a9 membrane filters. Subsamples (50 mL) \n\nfor analysing TN and TP were subjected to an oxidative digestion, using \n\nperoxodisulphate/alkali (Oxisolv\u00ae, Merck) and then filtered. \n\nSediments in overland flow samples were analyzed in the form of total suspended solids \n\n(TSS) and were quantified gravimetrically through filtration of 50 to 150 mL of water by a \n\nglass fibre filter, followed by drying to a constant weight at 105 \u00baC (APHA, 1998). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n100 \n\n \n\n5.2.4 Data analysis \n\nDifferences in total Kjedahl nitrogen (TKN) and available phosphorus (Pav) contents in \n\nash and topsoil, between study sites, were evaluated by a one-way ANOVA, if the assumptions \n\nof normality (checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test) and homogeneity of variance (checked by the \n\nLevene\u2019s test) were not rejected. If one or both of them were rejected, logarithmic \n\ntransformations of the data were performed to comply with the assumptions of the ANOVA \n\n(Zar, 1999). For each study site, differences in ash and soil TKN and Pav contents between \n\nsampling dates were evaluated by a one-way ANOVA followed by a multi comparison Tukey\u2019s \n\ntest, after checking for the ANOVA assumptions. \n\nRegarding NO3-N, TN, PO4-P and TP exports in overland flow and their respective \n\nconcentrations, a one-way ANOVA was performed to test differences between sites, after \n\nchecking for data normality and homogeneity of variance. If one or both of them were \n\nrejected, logarithmic transformations of the data were tried first and, if unsuccessful, the non-\n\nparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test was applied (Zar, 1999). Between-sites \n\ndifferences in overland flow and sediment losses were also evaluated by a one-way ANOVA. \n\nThe influence of environmental variables (rainfall amount and intensity, overland flow and \n\nsediment losses), on nitrogen and phosphorus losses by overland flow, were assessed by the \n\nPearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. In the case of the variables that had not met the normality \n\nassumption by the above-mentioned Shapiro-Wilk test, the coefficients were computed for \n\nthe transformed data.  \n\nThe significance level was set at 0.05, and all statistical analyses were performed using \n\nSigmaPlot 11.0 package software. \n\n5.3 Results and discussion \n\n5.3.1 Nitrogen and phosphorus contents in ash and topsoil \n\nThe average total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and available phosphorus (Pav) contents in the \n\nash and topsoil layers of the two study sites are shown in Table 5.2. No significant differences \n\nwere observed between the ashes collected at both study sites in terms of TKN (ANOVA: F = \n\n3.200, p = 0.111) or Pav (ANOVA: F = 0.226, p = 0.648) contents. As fire severity was similar at \n\nthe two study sites (Table 5.1), these results most likely reflected the pre-fire N and P \n\ncontents in topsoil organic matter and vegetation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n101 \n\n \nTable 5.2 \u2013 Average (\u00b1standard deviation) nitrogen (TKN) and available phosphorus (Pav) \n\nconcentrations/stocks in the ash and topsoil layers of the two study sites, throughout the study period \n\nBE-NW \u2014 burnt eucalypt site facing North-West; and BE-SE \u2014 burnt eucalypt site facing South-East. \n\nFor each variable, different letters and symbols within columns correspond to significant differences \n\n(p<0.05) among sampling dates at the BE-SE and at the BE-NW sites, respectively. \n\n \n\n  Nutrient Sampling date Layer Site \n\n        BE-SE BE-NW \n\nConcentrations TKN Aug 2010 Ash 1.50 \u00b1 0.42 1.96 \u00b1 0.40 \n(mg g-1)  \n\n \nSoil 0.70 \u00b1 0.23\u00aa 0.79 \u00b1 0.23x \n\n  \nFeb 2011 Soil 0.27 \u00b1 0.13b 0.46 \u00b1 0.19* \n\n  \nAug 2011 Soil 0.38 \u00b1 0.15 b 0.37 \u00b1 0.12* \n\n  \nFeb 2012 Soil 0.39 \u00b1 0.13 b 0.30 \u00b1 0.11* \n\n  \nAug 2012 Soil 0.23 \u00b1 0.06 b 0.24 \u00b1 0.08* \n\nPav Aug 2010 Ash 0.30 \u00b1 0.15 0.25 \u00b1 0.19 \n  \n\n \nSoil 0.13 \u00b1 0.10\u00aa 0.13 \u00b1 0.05x \n\n  \nFeb 2011 Soil 0.05 \u00b1 0.02b 0.03 \u00b1 0.02* \n\n  \nAug 2011 Soil 0.05 \u00b1 0.04b 0.03 \u00b1 0.03* \n\n  \nFeb 2012 Soil 0.05 \u00b1 0.04b 0.007 \u00b1 0.004* \n\n  \nAug 2012 Soil 0.02 \u00b1 0.02b 0.01 \u00b1 0.006* \n\nStocks  TKN Aug 2010 Soil 16.2 \u00b1 5.2 14.0 \u00b1 4.0 \n(g m-2)  Feb 2011 Soil 6.3 \u00b1 3.1 7.9 \u00b1 3.3 \n  Aug 2011 Soil 8.8 \u00b1 3.5 6.5 \u00b1 2.2 \n\n  Feb 2012 Soil 9.0 \u00b1 3.0 5.2 \u00b1 1.9 \n\n  Aug 2012 Soil 5.3 \u00b1 1.4 4.2 \u00b1 1.5 \n\nPav Aug 2010 Soil 3.0 \u00b1 2.2 2.2 \u00b1 0.9 \n\n  Feb 2011 Soil 1.2 \u00b1 0.4 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 \n\n  Aug 2011 Soil 1.2 \u00b1 0.8 0.4 \u00b1 0.6 \n\n  Feb 2012 Soil 1.1 \u00b1 0.9 0.1 \u00b1 0.07 \n\n    Aug 2012 Soil 0.5 \u00b1 0.5 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 \n\n \n\nFor both study sites, TKN ash contents immediately after the wildfire were on average \n\ntwo-fold higher than in the topsoil (Table 5.2). An explanation behind these findings is \n\nprobably related to the natural composition of plant biomass and litter layers, as they are \n\ntypically richer in N than soils (Busse and Debano, 2005; Nunes et al., 2010; Ribeiro et al., \n\n2002). Pav ash contents were on average 3 to 4 times higher than those of the topsoil at both \n\nstudy sites (Table 5.2). \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n102 \n\n \n\n \n\nTopsoil TKN contents did not differ significantly between the two study sites (ANOVA: \n\nF = 0.389, p = 0.536), in agreement with the results of the ash layer. In contrast, topsoil Pav \n\ncontents differed significantly (ANOVA: F = 4.812, p = 0.033) between the two study sites \n\n(Table 5.2), ), probably due to pre-fire differences in topsoil organic matter content, which \n\nwere maintained after the fire (Table 5.1). On one hand, the slightly higher soil organic matter \n\ncontents at the BE-SE site were likely to have been responsible for the somewhat higher Pav \n\ncontents in the topsoil, since fire-induced heating promotes the mineralization of soil organic \n\nmatter (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014). On the other hand, soil organic matter might have also influenced \n\nP adsorption and desorption processes (Kang et al., 2011; Otero et al., 2015). Soil organic \n\nmatter can both enhance P sorption by metals and inhibit P sorption, through competition of \n\norganic anions for P adsorption sites and also by increasing the negative charge of the topsoil \n\n(Kang et al., 2011). \n\nThe comparison of topsoil TKN contents between sampling dates (Table 5.2) revealed a \n\nsignificant decrease in soil nitrogen availability within the first 6 months after fire at both the \n\nBE-NW (ANOVA: F = 9.502, p &lt;0.001) and BE-SE site (ANOVA: F = 7.593, p &lt;0.001). After this \n\ninitially sharp decrease, a consistent but slight reduction in TKN contents was observed at the \n\nBE-NW site till the end of the monitoring period (Table 5.2). At the BE-SE site, on the other \n\nhand, an overall decline was observed after the first 6 months after fire but this was not \n\nconsistent over time since an increase in TKN contents was observed from February 2011 to \n\nAugust 2011, possibly as a result of litter decomposition (McIntosh et al., 2005), which was \n\nsubstantially higher at this site than at the BE-NW site (cf. section 5.2.1). \n\nAccording to the later author, as litter decomposes, nutrients can return to the soil surface, \n\nwhere they will be susceptible to leaching and erosion processes by runoff (McIntosh et al., \n\n2005) after intense rainfall events. Inconsistencies between sampling sites over time could \n\nalso be related to the multitude of factors influencing nitrogen pools, such as leaching \n\nprocesses, soil erosion, plant uptake and microbial immobilization as well as to the spatial \n\nheterogeneity of nutrient losses after fire (Hamman et al., 2008). \n\nEither way, the marked decrease (42% to 70%) in average topsoil contents observed at \n\nboth study sites from the beginning to the end of the monitoring period (Table 5.2), most \n\nlikely resulted from N leaching into deeper soil layers as well as N losses (Table 5.3) by runoff \n\nand soil erosion (Bod\u00ed et al., 2014; Caon et al., 2014; Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2008; Certini et al., \n\n2005; Khanna et al., 1994; Knoepp et al., 2005; Pausas et al., 2008; Shakesby, 2011; Thomas et \n\nal., 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n103 \n\n \nTable 5.3 \u2013 Total average (\u00b1standard deviation) nitrogen (NO3-N and TN) and phosphorus losses (PO4-\n\nP and TP), overland flow amounts, runoff coefficients and sediment losses for the 20 months following \n\nfire.

At the BE-SE site, on the other hand, topsoil Pav \n\ncontents did not differ significantly during the study period (ANOVA: F = 2.349, p = 0.089), \n\ndespite the overall decline trend. This more pronounced decline in average topsoil Pav \n\ncontents at the BE-NW site (80% to 94%) than at the BE-SE site (60% to 83%), was most \n\nlikely a result of the higher P losses by runoff and soil erosion observed at this slope (Table \n\n5.3). \n\n5.3.2 Spatial variation patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus exports by overland flow \n\nThe first two years after fire were considered regular hydrological years since rainfall \n\namounts (year 1 - 1416; year 2 \u2013 1175) were within the range of the long-term average \n\nannual rainfall at the nearby rainfall station (Ribeiradio). In the entire study period (August \n\n2010 to April 2012) roughly 2101 mm of rainfall have fell in the study area. Overall, runoff \n\ngenerated during the study period produced, on average, significantly higher nitrogen \n\n(ANOVA: F = 5.149, p = 0.027) and phosphorus losses by overland flow at the BE-NW site \n\nthan at the BE-SE site (Table 5.3; Figure 5.2 andFigure 5.3).  \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n104 \n\n \nFigure 5.2 - Nitrate (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate (PO4-P) and total phosphorus (TP) \n\nlosses by overland flow within the first 20 months after fire, at the burnt eucalypt site facing South-\n\nEast (BE-SE). BE-SEup \u2013 data from plots located on an upper part of the slope; BE-SEdown \u2013 data from \n\nplots located at the base of the slope. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n105 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 - Nitrate (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate (PO4-P) and total phosphorus (TP) \n\nlosses by overland flow within the first 20 months after fire, at the burnt eucalypt site facing North-\n\nWest (BE-NW).BE-NWup \u2013 data from plots located on an upper part of the slope; BE-NWdown \u2013 data \n\nfrom plots located at the base of the slope. \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n106 \n\nGlobal TN losses over the entire study period (Table 5.3) were almost two times higher \n\nat the BE-NW site (1.4 g m-2) than at the BE-SE site (0.8 g m-2). Also for dissolved N forms, i.e. \n\nNO3-N (Table 5.3), losses were about 2 times higher at the BE-NW site (0.08 g m-2) than at the \n\nBE-SE site (0.04 g m-2). However, NO3-N exports accounted only for less than 5% of the \n\noverall N exports at both sites, as N is mainly lost in its particulate forms (Soto et al., 1997) \n\n(Table 5.3). \n\nThe predominance of particulate forms in overland flow was even more pronounced for \n\nP, as the contribution of PO4-P losses represented only 0.02 to 0.03% of the overall P losses \n\n(Table 5.3). As regards to this nutrient, and similarly to what was found for N, significant \n\nlosses (TP \u2013 ANOVA: F = 11.116, p = 0.001; PO4-P \u2013 ANOVA: F = 15.554, p &lt;0.001) were found \n\nbetween the two sites. At the BE-NW site, global TP losses were almost 4 times higher than at \n\nthe BE-SE site (0.7 vs. 0.2 g m-2; Table 3). The differences in global PO4-P losses between these \n\ntwo sites were even more pronounced, being about 10 times higher at the BE-NW (0.0002 g \n\nm-2) than at the BE-SE site (0.00002 g m-2).Between-site differences in N and P exports were \n\nmost likely related to the higher sediment losses (ANOVA: F = 6.149, p = 0.016) at the BE-NW \n\nthan at the BE-SE site (Table 5.3; Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5), since similar (ANOVA: F = \n\n0.000721, p = 0.979) overland flow amounts were generated at each site. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 - Overland flow amount and sediment losses by overland flow within the first 20 months \n\nafter fire, at the burnt eucalypt site facing South-East (BE-SE).

BE-NWup \u2013 data from plots located on \n\nan upper part of the slope; BE-NWdown \u2013 data from plots located at the base of the slope. \n\n \n\n \n\nAs most N and P are exported in its particulate form, higher losses were found at the site \n\nwith highest sediment losses (i.e. BE-NW). These results are also corroborated by the \n\nPearson\u2019s correlations (Table 5.4), since no relationship was found between NO3-N exports \n\nand the hydrological (I30: r = 0.44; Overland flow: r = 0.45) and erosion variables (r = 0.26) at \n\nthe BE-SE site, unlike at the BE-NW site. As this dissolved N form has a higher contribution \n\nfor overall exports than PO4-P (Table 5.3), no correlation was found in the site with lower \n\nsediment losses. When comparing the overall TN losses in the first 20 months after fire with \n\nthe changes in soil N contents from the beginning to the end of the study period, it was \n\nnoticeable that TN losses by overland flow at the BE-NW site represented twice as much of \n\nthe topsoil N losses (14 %) than at the BE-SE site (7%). The same was true for P, since overall \n\nTP losses by overland flow corresponded to a 35% reduction in soil P stocks at the BE-NW \n\nsite (and only to an 8% reduction at the BE-SE site (8%) (Table 5.2 and Table 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n108 \n\n \nTable 5.4 \u2013 Pearson correlations between environmental variables (i.e. rainfall amount, maximum \n\nrainfall intensity during 30 min -I30, overland flow and suspended sediments) and nitrogen (NO3-N and \n\nTN) and phosphorus losses (PO4-P and TP) by overland flow (averages per read out).

According to the previous studies, as south-facing slopes receive higher solar \n\nradiation than those facing north, this affects  soil moisture, and soil aggregation processes, \n\nwhich, in tum, affect vegetation growth that tends to be lower on these slopes (Kutiel and \n\nLavee, 1999; Sternberg and Shoshany, 2001; Gabarr\u00f3n-Galeote et al., 2013). As a result of its \n\nhigher vegetation cover and therefore lower bare soil and rock outcrops, north-facing slopes \n\ntypically present lower sediments losses than south-facing slopes (Cerd\u00e1, 1998; Kutiel and \n\nLavee, 1999; Sternberg and Shoshany, 2001). As slope aspect is unlikely to have been \n\nresponsible for the differences between sites, the alternative explanation would be the \n\ndifferences in pre-fire management operations, since the BE-NW site was under an intensive \n\nlogging intervention of clear-cutting before the fire, which might have highly modified the soil \n\nsurface and vegetation pattern. Clear-cutting is widely known not only to damage the ground \n\nand shrub layer but also to eliminate tree interception and promote soil compaction (Beasley \n\nand Granillo, 1985).  The removal of vegetation, in particular, makes the soil more vulnerable \n\nto splash erosion, thereby promoting overland flow generation and the associated sediment \n\nand nutrient losses (Beasley and Granillo, 1985). Soil compaction by mechanical soil \n\ndisturbance also influences the hydrological and erosive response of forest areas by \n\ndecreasing macroporosity as well as the soil hydraulic connectivity and infiltration capacity \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n109 \n\n(Carr and Loague, 2012; Huang et al., 1996). Taking into account the findings of present \n\nstudy, one might therefore hypothesize that pre-fire management operations are crucial for \n\npost-fire soil fertility losses. \n\nWithin each site, overall nitrogen and phosphorus losses differed between plots with \n\ndifferent locations along the slope, but the response was not consistent between sites site \n\n(Figure 5.2 andFigure 5.3). At the BE-SE site (Figure 2), NO3-N (0.06 vs. 0.02 g m-2) and TN \n\nexports (1.1 vs. 0.4 g m-2), as well as PO4-P (0.00003 vs. 0.00002 g m-2) and TP exports (0.2 vs \n\n0.09 g m-2) were higher at plots located at the base of the slope than at those located in an \n\nupper part of the slope. Conversely, at the BE-NW site, higher nitrogen (NO3-N: 0.13 vs. 0.03 g \n\nm-2; TN: 1.9 vs. 0.9 g m-2) and phosphorus (PO4-P: 0.0004 vs. 0.00004 g m-2; TP: 1.0 vs. 0.34 g \n\nm-2) losses were found for plots with an upper slope position than those located at the base of \n\nthe slope (Figure 5.3). These results are in agreement to prior studies in the region, which \n\nfound contradictory results on the role of slope position on post-fire runoff and erosion at the \n\nmicro-plot scale (Malvar et al., 2015; Prats et al., 2014). \n\n5.3.3 Temporal variation patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus exports by overland flow \n\nAt both study sites, peaks of NO3-N, TN, PO4-P, TP and sediments exports were generally \n\nassociated to the major rainfall events (Figure 5.2 andFigure 5.3), as expected since these \n\nevents generated the highest amounts of runoff and sediment losses (Figure 5.4 and Figure \n\n5.5), as also observed in other burnt areas of the Mediterranean region (Bad\u00eda et al., 2014; \n\nSoto et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 1999, 2000b). \n\nThe highest nitrogen and phosphorus losses occurred in the third week after the fire \n\n(Figure 5.2 andFigure 5.3) most likely because the rainfall amounts (> 20 mm) were large \n\nenough to saturate the ash layer and trigger overland flow and erosion processes. Nitrogen \n\nand phosphorus exports varied markedly in the first six months after fire, showing a clear \n\ndecline with time-since-fire (Figure 5.2 andFigure 5.3). \n\nSubsequent peaks were lower and occurred in response to extreme rainfall events (>50 \n\nmm per week). An exception pattern was found at the eucalypt site facing north (BE-NW), \n\nwhere clear peaks in N exports were observed along the monitoring period (Figure 5.3),in \n\nresponse to extreme rainfall events. At the BE-SE site, on the other hand, N exports were \n\nunrelated to rainfall amounts, after the first four months after fire (Figure 5.2).  \n\n5.3.4 Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in overland flow \n\nThe temporal patterns of nitrate (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate (PO4-P) \n\nand total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in overland flow for the 20 months following fire \n\nare presented in Figure 5.6 and Figure 5.7.  \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n110 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 - Nitrate (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate (PO4-P) and total phosphorus (TP) \n\nconcentrations in overland flow, within the first 20 months after fire, at the burnt eucalypt site facing \n\nSouth-East (BE-SE).

Nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus concentration peaks were not directly related with the major overland flow \n\nevents (Figure 5.6 and Figure 5.7), ), in contrast to the N and P exports (Figure 5.2 andFigure \n\n5.3). This was more evident immediately after the first significant post-fire rainfall event, \n\nwhen almost all the plots exhibited a major peak in dissolved and total nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus concentrations, most likely as a result of the detachment and transport of the \n\nnutrient enriched, easily erodible ash layer and of the partially combusted organic material \n\non the ground surface (Ferreira et al., 2005, 2008; Thomas et al., 1999). After this first event, \n\npeaks in dissolved and total nutrient concentrations were often unrelated to \n\nrainfall/overland flow events, possibly because of the complex biogeochemical processes \n\noccurring in burnt forest areas (Caon et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n5.4 Conclusions \n\nThe present work evaluated post-fire nitrogen and phosphorus losses by overland flow \n\nat micro-plot scale in a recently burnt Mediterranean area, providing estimates of the range \n\nof N and P exports in a fire-prone landscape. It represents an important addition to the \n\nstudies on post-fire nutrient losses by overland flow conducted in the Mediterranean region, \n\nwhich are crucial for anticipating the impacts of recurrent fires on soil productivity. Nitrogen \n\nand phosphorus exports were particularly pronounced in the three months after fire. \n\nHowever, after this initial period, peaks in N and P exports were also observed in association \n\nto intense rainfall events. These results thereby show that broader time scales are useful to \n\ngain insight into the soil fertility losses in burnt forest areas. \n\nAlthough micro-plots can provide a rapid characterization of the hydrological and \n\nerosion response in burnt forest areas, the results of this study should be analysed with some \n\ncaution as micro-plots usually have some limitations regarding the representativeness of \n\npost-fire hydrological and erosive processes at the field scale. Regardless of these constraints, \n\nthe present study can be viewed as an important contribution for a better understanding of \n\npost-fire nitrogen and phosphorus exports in the Mediterranean region, where wildfires are \n\nexpected to become more frequent as a result of climate changes. Studies at larger spatial \n\nscales are also recommended for a comprehensive understanding of nutrient dynamics after \n\nwildfires and assessment of post-fire erosion risks, which has important implications for the \n\nrecovery process of burned Mediterranean forests as well as for post-fire land management. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n113 \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis research was financed by national funds through FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC), with co-\n\nfunding by FEDER through COMPETE (Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade; \n\nPOFC) in the scope of the project FIRECNUTS (PTDC/AGR-CFL/104559/2008), and with \n\nsupport of the research grants attributed by FCT/MCTES (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a \n\nTecnologia/Minist\u00e9rio da Ci\u00eancia, da Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, Portugal) to Raquel \n\nVasconcelos Ferreira (SFRH/BD/45778/2008) and Dalila Serpa (SFRH/BPD/92650/2013). \n\nAdditional financial support was provided by the EU-FP7 project RECARE (contract number \n\ngrant agreement 603498).

DOI:10.18172/cig.2522 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\nChapter 6 - General conclusions \n\nThe present study focused on post-fire nutrient mobilization by overland flow, and in \n\nrelation to soil nutrient stocks, focusing on several features, with different nutrients: \n\n \n\n(i)  Short-term variation of base cations losses in contrasting slopes in terms of \n\nvegetation (eucalypt vs. pine) and parent material (granite vs. schist), at micro-plot scale \n\nand slope scale, with comparison to unburnt slope only at slope scale; in a selection of \n\nsome rainfall events over the six-months monitoring period (Chapter 2); \n\n \n\n(ii)  Short-term variation of nitrogen losses in contrasting slopes in terms of \n\nvegetation (eucalypt vs. pine) and parent material (granite vs. schist), at micro-plot scale, \n\nover a six-months monitoring period (Chapter 3); \n\n \n\n(iii) Short-term variation of phosphorus losses in contrasting slopes in terms of \n\nvegetation (eucalypt vs. pine) and parent material (granite vs. schist), at micro-plot scale, \n\nover a six-months monitoring period (Chapter 4); \n\n \n\n(iv) Temporal and spatial variation of nitrogen and phosphorus losses in \n\ncontrasting slopes in terms of slope aspect, in eucalypt plantations, at micro-plot, over a \n\ntwenty-months monitoring period (Chapter 5). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe fact that this work was carried out in the Mediterranean Basin is important since \n\nthis region coincide with mountain areas where the soils are often weakly developed and \n\npoor in nutrients, regardless of their abundant vegetation. Also important for anticipating the \n\nimpacts of recurrent fires on soil productivity because fire frequency is expected to increase \n\nin the future as a result of climate changes.  \n\n \n\nThe main conclusions from the results obtained in Chapters 2 to 5 are summarized as \n\nfollows:  \n\n \n\n\n\nWildfire effects on soil nutrients stocks and exports by overland flow \n\n120 \n\n \n\ni) the existence of a protective litter layer (i.e. of scorched pine needles) at the burnt pine \n\nsite considerably reduced post-fire N export compared to the burnt eucalypt site, mainly by \n\ndecreasing overland flow generation and the associated sediment losses. This information \n\ncan be considered relevant for post-fire land management since it emphasizes that \n\nspontaneous mulching can be highly effective to reduce soil (fertility) losses and, thereby, will \n\nmake further soil conservation measures superfluous.    \n\n \n\n ii) overland flow and soil (fertility) losses were markedly lower at the eucalypt site on \n\ngranite than at that at the eucalypt site on schist, probably due to the coarser texture and, \n\nthus, higher infiltration capacity of the granite soils. This parent material-related difference in \n\npost-fire erosion risk is important for defining priorities in post-fire land management and, in \n\nparticular, for the application of soil conservation measures such as mulching.  \n\n \n\niii) overland flow and soil losses were also markedly lower at the site facing south than \n\nat that facing north. The pre-fire conditions could also have contributed to this difference, \n\nsince the site facing north was having a logging operation at the time of the fire. This \n\noperation could have promoted forest soil disturbances, such as affecting soil infiltration \n\ncapacity, and increased the amount of biomass available on the ground, enriching even more \n\nthe nutrient-rich ash layer, contributing for the distinctly losses between sites; \n\n \n\niv) nutrients exports were particularly intense in the two months after fire but after this \n\ninitial period, peaks in nutrients concentrations were also observed in association to intense \n\nrainfall events. These results suggest that wider time scales (i.e. wider than 6 months) are \n\nneeded to evaluate the full extension of wildfires on forest lands. Nevertheless, it seems \n\nreasonable to recommend that post-fire management efforts should focus on the first 3 \n\nmonths after fire, to minimize the loss of soil fertility and degradation of burnt forest areas. \n\n \n\nv) scale size is an important factor when studying the effects of wildfires on soil \n\ndegradation, since different responses were observed at micro-plot and slope scale. At \n\nsmaller scales, cation losses were higher than at larger scales, possibly because runoff and \n\nerosion decreases at larger scales as a result of changes in the soil infiltration patterns. These \n\nfindings confirm the idea that although micro-plots may be suitable to quickly characterize \n\nthe hydrological and erosion response in burnt forest areas, studies carried out at a larger \n\nscale are probably closer to reality due to a better representation of the natural connectivity \n\nwithin forest systems. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\nStudies at broader spatial scales, as well as wider time scales, are therefore \n\nrecommended to assess the effective risk of post-fire soil fertility loss, which has important \n\nimplications for the recovery process of burned Mediterranean forests as well as for post-fire \n\nland management. \n\n \n\nThe present findings are viewed as an important contribution to the current knowledge \n\nof post-fire nutrient mobilization and redistribution and of the resulting soil degradation in \n\nthe Mediterranean Basin, especially since such information continues to be scarce for this \n\nregion and since Mediterranean soils are typically nutrient poor. Future studies are, however, \n\nrecommended to address broader spatial scales as well as wider time scales to fully \n\nunderstand post-fire nutrient dynamics and to assess the effective risk of post-fire soil \n\nfertility loss, which has important implications for the recovery process of burned \n\nMediterranean forests as well as for post-fire land management."}]}}}
