Synthetic plugs are required to understand \n\noilfield properties and the behavior of oil in reservoirs where natural plugs cannot be \n\nextracted. Specifically, in cases where it is necessary to reproduce representative \n\nmineralogical and petrophysical characteristics from carbonates reservoir, it is evident that \n\nthere are a lack of publications focusing on synthetic plug construction. In this work, the \n\nconstruction of synthetic plugs is studied, using a combination of published methodologies \n\nto achieve an alternative construction of synthetic carbonate plugs for laboratory scale \n\nstudies. The obtained plugs used a procedure based on disintegrated rock matrices with \n\nknown particle sizes and particle size ratio, uniaxial compaction with controlled load force \n\nand velocity, CaCO3 solubility control by changing temperature and pH and bonding \n\nmaterial. Consolidation, wettability and petrophysical properties of the synthetic plugs \n\nwere evaluated to characterize them. Generally, it was observed that the porosity and \n\npermeability features of the synthetic plugs were within the range of carbonate reservoirs. \n\nHowever, without reproducing a heterogeneous pore structure normally present in natural \n\nsamples. On the other hand, wettability properties of the resulted synthetic plugs were \n\nsimilar to the natural carbonate plugs.  Further studies are necessary to obtain more \n\nsimilar chemical and petrophysical properties to the natural samples.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: synthetic, carbonate, plugs, petroleum, petrophysics, wettability, consolidation \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nRESUMO \n \n\nA localiza\u00e7\u00e3o em \u00e1guas ultra profundas das reservas petrol\u00edferas do pr\u00e9-sal brasileiro e \n\na alta heterogeneidade dos seus reservat\u00f3rios carbon\u00e1ticos dificultam a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\numa amostra de rocha representativa, al\u00e9m de ser uma opera\u00e7\u00e3o de risco e de alto \n\ndisp\u00eandio.

Especificamente, nos casos \n\nonde s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios reproduzir caracter\u00edsticas representativas mineral\u00f3gicas e \n\npetrof\u00edsicas dos reservat\u00f3rios carbon\u00e1ticos, sendo not\u00f3rio a falta de publica\u00e7\u00f5es voltada \n\npara constru\u00e7\u00e3o de plugues sint\u00e9ticos. No presente trabalho, estudou-se a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nplugues sint\u00e9ticos empregando metodologias j\u00e1 difundidas, visando a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nplugues carbon\u00e1ticos sint\u00e9ticos para utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o em escala laboratorial. Os plugues obtidos \n\nforam constru\u00eddos utilizando matrizes de rochas desintegradas com tamanhos e \n\npropor\u00e7\u00f5es de part\u00edculas conhecidos, compacta\u00e7\u00e3o uniaxial com for\u00e7a e velocidades \n\ncontroladas e controle de solubilidade de CaCO3, variando apenas temperatura, pH e \n\npropor\u00e7\u00f5es de material cimentante. Foram avaliadas as propriedades petrof\u00edsicas, a \n\nmolhabilidade e a consolida\u00e7\u00e3o dos plugues sint\u00e9ticos para posterior caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nmesmos. Comumente, observou-se que os valores de porosidade e permeabilidade dos \n\nplugues sint\u00e9ticos se encontravam dentro do intervalo de valores obtidos em \n\nreservat\u00f3rios carbon\u00e1ticos reais. No entanto, n\u00e3o reproduziram a estrutura heterog\u00eanea \n\ndos poros, normalmente presente em amostras de rochas naturais. Em contrapartida, as \n\npropriedades de molhabilidade dos plugues sint\u00e9ticos se apresentaram an\u00e1logas aos \n\nplugues de rochas carbon\u00e1ticas naturais.

Plugs are cylindrical rocks with specific \n\ndimensions about 3.8 cm in diameter and a height 1.5 times greater than the diameter, \n\nextracted by drilling from reservoirs (CONSENTINO, 2001). Due to the representative in-\n\nsitu characteristics such as mineralogical composition and petrophysical properties \n\n(CONSENTINO, 2001), plugs are used to understand at a laboratory scale the behavior \n\nand interaction of the reservoir rocks and fluids in a production system (GAAFAR; \n\nTEWARI; ZAIN, 2015; ALOTAIBI; AZMY; NASR-EL-DIN, 2010). For example, Svec and \n\nGrigg (2001), used plugs to study the enhance oil recovery during an injection of water \n\nalternating gas; Howe et al. (2015) flowed surfactants through plugs to study changes in \n\noil production; Zamirian et al. (2014) reported new techniques for measuring \n\npermeabilities under in-situ conditions using plugs.  \n\nIn cases such as the Brazilian Presalt carbonate reservoirs, heterogeneity and high \n\ndepths (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 2012; BARBASSA, 2007) make it difficult to obtain reservoir \n\nplugs. Due to this challenge, commercial plugs (SANNI, 2013; CHURCHER et al, 1991) \n\nor synthetic plugs constructed in the laboratory (TAREK 2014; GREAVES et al, 1996; \n\nBERNARD, 1967; FURRE; HOLT, 1995) may be used. Some research works can be \n\nfound in the literature relating about the construction of this plugs, but in contrast to the \n\nsandstone reservoirs (WANG et al, 2008; RAIMONDI; TORCASO, 1964; ANBAH; \n\nCHILINGAR; BEESON, 1965), there is a lack of publications that focus on the construction \n\nof representative carbonates that consider both mineralogical composition and \n\npetrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability. \n\nIn this sense, the contribution of this work is to study a methodology to construct \n\nsynthetic carbonate plugs, using a combination of published methodologies aiming to \n\nreproduce the mineralogy and control the petrophysics properties similar to the natural \n\nsamples, in order to enable the generation of promising studies to understand the oil and \n\ngas reservoirs, such as the Brazilian Presalt.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n1.1 OBJECTIVE \n \n \n\nTo study a methodology to construct synthetic carbonate plugs aiming to reproduce \n\nthe mineralogy and control the petrophysics properties similar to the natural samples. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW \n \n\n2.1 CARBONATE NATURAL ROCK PROPERTIES  \n \n\nIn order to construct synthetic plugs with similar properties to natural rocks, it was \n\nnecessary to screening properties of natural carbonate samples. Plugs are formed by \n\ncarbonates or sandstones, which are the main conforming types of rock in oil and gas \n\nexploration areas (EHRENBERG; NADEAU, 2005). These two types of rocks have \n\nsignificant differences. The former is the sediment production location, and the latter is \n\nthe higher chemical reactivity due to the carbonate mineral (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 2012). \n\nOne of the know carbonate rock found in the Brazilian Presalt is the dolomite rock (JING \n\net al., 2012; BOYD et al., 2015). Due to the rock chemistry, wettability properties of \n\ncarbonate rocks are different of sandstone rocks. Wettability can be explained as the \n\npreference of a solid surface to be in contact with a fluid in the presence of other \n\nimmiscible fluids (ANDERSON, 1986). Wettability of a solid surface can be preferentially \n\nhydrophilic (water-wet) or hydrophobic (oil-wet). Literature reports wettability of natural \n\ncarbonate rocks to be intermediate and oil-wet (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 2012; MANRIQUE \n\net al., 2004; MASALMEH et al., 2014; AL-DHAHLI et al., 2011; AKKURT et al., 2000), \n\ncontrary to the known water-wet for sandstone rocks (PENTLAND et al., 2010; CHATZIS \n\net al., 1988).   \n\nPetrophysical characteristics are important in the evaluation and characterization \n\nof oilfields rocks (QIN et al., 2018). Petrophysics is defined as the study of physical, \n\nelectrical and mechanical properties and rock-fluid interaction in a petroleum system \n\n(CHEN; PAGAN, 2013). In this work, it was studied the physical properties porosity and \n\npermeability in the synthetic plugs, in order to understand how to control and reproduce \n\nthese properties similar to the samples found in oilfield. In this sense, it is important to \n\nmention that petrophysic properties of natural carbonate rocks are heterogeneous and \n\nhighly variable, due to the combination of micro-porosities, intergranular porosities, vuggy \n\nporosities and fracture porosities (MURPHY et al., 1996). Table 2.1 presents the \n\npetrophysical properties of some carbonate Brazilian Presalt oilfields, in order to evidence \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nthe mentioned highly variable properties. Additionally, it was observed porosities from 6% \n\nto 28% and permeabilities from 0.1 mD to 10000 mD.    \n\n \nTable 2.1 \u2013 Petrophysical properties of some carbonate Brazilian Presalt oilfields \n\nBrazilian Presalt oilfield Porosity (%) Permeability (mD) \n\nBicudo (ANP, 2018a) 28 10 -10000 \nBonito (ANP, 2018b) - &lt;10 \n\nGaroupa (ANP, 2018c) 18 10 - 100 \nLinguado (ANP, 2018d) 22 / 10 / 10 380 / 250 / 50 \nPampo (ANP, 2018e) 10 - 25 250 - 1000 \n\nPiranema (ANP, 2018f) 19 \u2013 26 - \nSiri (ANP, 2018g) 6 0.1 \u2013 15 \n\nBadejo (ANP, 2018h) 10 250 \nTrilha (ANP, 2018i) 10 390 \n\n \n \n2.2 CONSTRUCTION OF SYNTHETIC PLUGS \n\n \n\nA selection of papers was screened by using the following keywords: lithology \n\n(carbonate), rock sampling (plug or core) and sample feature (synthetic or artificial). Only \n\npapers focused on the use of such samples for the petroleum engineering area, and the \n\nones where the construction methodology could be identified, were considered. In \n\naddition, some undergraduate and master's degree works were analyzed. \n\n \n\n2.3 MATERIALS AND CONTENTS USED TO CONSTRUCT SYNTHETIC PLUGS \n \nDue to the relationship between the rock chemistry and the material used to \n\nconstruct synthetic plugs, it was important to identify the main materials and their contents \n\nwhich were used to construct such samples, independent of the approach used for their \n\nconstruction, such us uniaxial compression, cementing of materials, sintering and others. \n\nIn this way, it was possible to identify 10 different materials and theirs contents. \n\nTable 2.2 presents these materials, their content range and associated publications. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nTable 2.2- Main minerals used to construct synthetic plugs \n \n\nMinerals Constructed plugs Content range % (w/w) References \n\nSand 9 70-98% i.e (BERNARD, 1967) i.e (PURNAMA, 2011) \nSilica sand 8 80-100% i.e (RAIMONDI; TORCASO, 1964) \nQuartz sand 3 50-85%  i.e (WANG et al, 2008) \n\nCarmel silica sand 2 95% \ni.e (ANBAH; \n\nCHILINGAR; BEESON, \n1965) \n\nCrushed rock* 2 95-100% i.e (LAKATOS et al, 2003) \nOttawa silica sand 1 90%  (ANBAH; CHILINGAR; BEESON, 1965) \nToyoura silica sand 1 98% (OYAMA et al, 2016) \nCaCO3 4 95% \n\ni.e (FEDRIZZI et al., \n2018) \n\nBentonite 1 100% (OYAMA et al, 2016) \nKaolinite 1 100%  (OYAMA et al, 2016) \n\n \n* lithology non-identified \n \nSource: from author \n\n \nFrom Table 2.2, it is possible to identify the materials content range from 50% to \n\n100% (w/w) of the synthetic plugs. Note that from these 10 materials, 6 correspond to \n\nsand matrices, and the rest include crushed formation rock, CaCO3, bentonites and \n\nkaolinites. Most of these selected studies were therefore based on the construction of \n\nsandstone plugs. There are two likely reasons for this finding. The first is that constructing \n\na porous media with a naturally granulated material, with known particle size, is fast and \n\neasy. The second is that because it is a porous media, it allows studies with no influence \n\nof chemical reactivity, due to the simple chemical composition of the sand (silicon and \n\noxygen) (WEINAN et al., 1997). \n\nRegarding the approach for construction of carbonate plugs, it was possible to \n\nidentify four works that used a carbonate matrix material and its content (ANBAH; \n\nCHILINGAR;  BEESON, 1965; FEDRIZZI et al., 2018; WANG et al. 2017; LUO et al. \n\n2018). For example, Anbah; Chilingar and  Beeson (1965) used calcite flour as its main \n\ncomponent material (95% w/w), carbonate plugs were constructed for the application of \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nelectrical current to increase the flow rate of oil and water in a porous media, however \n\npetrophysical properties were not reproduced or correlated with the presented \n\nmethodology. From another approach, Fedrizzi et al. (2018) related the construction of \n\ncarbonate rocks using calcite, sand, Portland cement and water. In this work, it was \n\ninvestigated the main petrophysical characteristics of these samples and the relationship \n\nwith the amount of cementing material, however this study did not consider the possible \n\nheterogeneous porous structure of natural carbonate rocks. The construction of \n\nrepresentative synthetic carbonate plugs requires special pore studies considerations that \n\nit was not studied by Fedrizzi et al. (2018). \n\nWang et al. (2017), during the construction process, embedded NaCl grains of \n\naverage particle size of 3mm and aluminum foils with radius of 1.5 mm and a thickness of \n\n20 \u00b5m into a blend of carbonate drilling cuttings and epoxy resin. Then, the embedded \n\nmaterials were leached out by immersing the consolidated synthetic plug in 75 \u00baC water \n\nand 4% NaOH (sodium hydroxide) alkali solution respectively. The use of these materials \n\nand procedures simulates vuggy (due to the NaCl) and crack (due to the aluminum foils) \n\npores into the samples. Their observation indicated that secondary pores crack and vuggy \n\nare important factors to control the permeability of the synthetic plugs. It was observed \n\nthat increasing the quantity of NaCl grains the permeability increases with the increase of \n\ntotal porosity, contrary to the observed with aluminum foils which decrease the \n\npermeability and increase the porosity, increasing the quantity of aluminum foil used. \n\nHowever, it is necessary to develop a better understand about the pore structure and the \n\ninfluence of the quantity of epoxy resin and particle size drilling cuttings in the \n\npetrophysical properties. Additionally, the chemical nature of epoxy resin as bonding \n\nmaterial could change the chemical properties of the constructed samples, fact that can \n\naffect the fluid-rock interaction tests, such as, wettability measurements.    \n\nTherefore, using the same base material, Luo et al. (2018) prepared drill cuttings \n\nwith toluene as a packing fluid and then, they applied a compression press of 5000 psi for \n\n30 minutes to consolidate the synthetic plugs. As the main objective of this research was \n\nthe evaluation of formation damage using synthetic plugs, the influence of compression \n\npress and drill cuttings particle properties in the petrophysical properties was not \n\nidentified. In this sense, despite of mineralogical properties of the constructed plugs may \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nbe similar to the found in a specific field, these analog samples not guarantee the \n\nreproduction and control of similar petrophysical properties of the natural plugs. \n\nAdditional papers were identified that used a non-carbonate matrix material, such \n\nas sands, but using cementing procedures to allow the calcium carbonate precipitation on \n\nthem. Melo, (2012), evaluated a quartz sand (50% w/w) cemented in a medium favorable \n\nto precipitation of calcium carbonate to simulate a carbonate medium. The aim was to \n\nevaluate the geochemical interactions with a reactive fluid for carbon dioxide geological \n\nstorage purposes. The findings and discussion about these approaches will be detailed in \n\nthe following sections. \n\nAccording to Tiab and Donaldson (2004), petrophysical properties of rocks depend \n\non the particle size, amount of cementation and compaction. For this reason, the next \n\nanalyses from this literature review will be focused on these parameters. \n\n \n\n2.4 PARTICLE SIZE \n \nIt is important to mention the importance of the particle size distribution on porosity \n\nand permeability. Particle size is defined as the size of each particle which compounds a \n\nporous media. Naturally, a rock is composed of different particle sizes, which generates a \n\nheterogeneous system. Empty spaces called pores are generated between these \n\nparticles, and fluids, such as oil and gas, can be stored in these spaces in reservoir rock. \n\nThe measurement of this empty space, commonly known as porosity, is defined by the \n\nrelation between the volume of the empty space and the bulk volume of the sample (where \n\npore volume is dependent on the volume of particle, and therefore also dependent on its \n\nsize) and calculated using equation (1) (TIAB; DONALDSON, 2004; HOLSTEIN, 2007). \n\n \n \n\n?(%) =\t\n????\t??????\n????\t??????\n\n\u00d7 100 =\n????\t?????? ? ?????\t??????\n\n????\t??????\n\u00d7 100 (1) \n\n  \n \nIn the case of an ideal system with an arrangement of uniform spheres and a fixed \n\nbulk volume, the porosity will be independent of the particle volume, and therefore of the \n\nparticle size. But in a real system with particles of different sizes, smaller particles enter \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nthe empty spaces between the larger particles, thus decreasing the porosity. This \n\ndemonstrates the importance of the particle size on the resulting porosity (HOLSTEIN, \n\n2007). Figure 1 presents a schematic of three porous solids with the same dimension and \n\ncomposed by different particle sizes: A. Large uniform particle, B. Uniform smaller particle \n\nsize and C. Different size particles. For these cases, the porosity will be demonstrated \n\nbased on Equation 1. The bulk volume of the three solids with dimensions, L, was \n\ncalculated. \n\n \n \n\n????\t?????? = ? \u00d7 ? \u00d7 ? =\t?9 (2) \n \n \nSubsequently, it is necessary to calculate the volume occupied by the particles in \n\neach of the examples cited previously. For this, it is necessary to employ the following \n\nvolume sphere equations: A. L/2 radius, B. 8 spheres of L/4 radius and C. 8 spheres of \n\nL/4 radius for larger particles, and 6 spheres of L/6 for smaller particles. \n\n \n\n?????\t??????\t????\t? =\t\n4\n3\n?B\n?\n2\nD\n9\n\n=\t\n1\n6\n??9 \n\n(  \n(3) \n\n \n\n?????\t??????\t????\t? = 8 \u00d7 H\t\n4\n3\n?B\n?\n4\nD\n9\n\nI =\n1\n6\n??9 (4) \n\n \n\n?????\t??????\t????\t? = \t8 \u00d7 H\n4\n3\n?B\n?\n4\nD\n9\n\nI + 6 \u00d7 H\n4\n3\n?B\n?\n6\nD\n9\n\nI =\n11\n54\n??9 (5) \n\n \nFinally, using Equation 1, the porosity of these volumes was calculated: \n \n\n?(%)? =\n?9 ? 16??\n\n9\n\n?9\n\u00d7 100 =\n\n6 ? ?\n6\n\n\u00d7 100 = 47.6% \n(\n\n(6) \n \n\n?(%)? =\n?9 ? 16??\n\n9\n\n?9\n\u00d7 100 =\n\n6 ? ?\n6\n\n\u00d7 100 = 47.6% (7) \n \n\n \n\n?(%)? =\n?9 ? 1154??\n\n9\n\n?9\n\u00d7 100 =\n\n54 ? 11?\n54\n\n\u00d7 100 = 36.0% (8) \n\n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nAccording to the obtained results, it was shown that in ideal systems with uniform \n\nparticles, as for cases A and B, the resulting porosity is the same, corroborating the non-\n\nrelation between particle size and porosity. Otherwise, in the real system, C, that contains \n\nparticles of different sizes, the presence of smaller particles affects the porous space and \n\ndecreases the porosity. In the same way, similar reductions for porosity are expected due \n\nto the influences of compaction and cementation. This occurs because empty spaces will \n\nbe filled by particles or cementitious materials, which decreases the percentage of pores \n\nin a solid sample. In addition, the ability of the oil stored in the pores to flow through a \n\nreservoir rock, known as permeability, has a direct relationship with the particle size, \n\nconsolidation and cementation of the sample. \n\nIn cases where a solid possesses connected pores, the presence of smaller \n\nparticles occupying the empty spaces, as well as high degrees of compaction and \n\ncementation, generally reduce the permeability. This can be corroborated by the \n\nmathematical equation by Darcy for the flow of a fluid in a porous medium, by studying \n\nthe pressure gradients (TIAB; DONALDSON, 2004; HOLSTEIN, 2007). \n\n \n\n?? =\t\n?\n?S\n\n= ?\n?\n?\n??\n??\n\n (9) \n\n \nwhere: \n?? = fluid velocity, cm/s \n? = flow rate, cm3/s \n? = permeability of the porous rock, Darcy \n?S = cross-sectional area of the rock, cm2 \n? = viscosity of the fluid, cP \n? = lenght of the rock sample, cm \nUV\nUW\n\n = pressure gradient in the direction of the flow, atm/cm \n\n \n \nFigure 1 presents an interpretation of the flow of a fluid within 3 types of porous solids. \n\nFrom here, it is possible to demonstrate the application of the previous mathematical equation by \n\nDarcy. Flow restrictions caused by a decrease of the porous space due to the presence of particles \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nof different sizes, compaction, or cementation result in a increase in the pressure gradients, and \n\ntherefore lower permeabilities. \n \nFigure 1 - Porosity and permeability due to A: Uniform particle of large size, B: Smaller uniforms \nparticles and C: Different sized particles. \n \n \n\n \nPorosity Permeability \n\nA \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB \n\n  \n\n \n\nC \n\n \n \n\n \nSource: from author \n\n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nIt is important to mention that only 33 papers described particle sizes, allowing the \n\nidentification of a range from 0.017 mm to 4.76 mm. To have a better view of the particle \n\nsizes used, the times in which these granulometries were used versus particle size was \n\nplotted. Figure 2 presents this particle distribution. It should be noted that the thickest and \n\nfinest particles were less used. This could be explained by causing a weak consolidation \n\nof the sample for the former, and a substantial decrease in the porosities and \n\npermeabilities for the latter. However, fine particle sizes can improve the consolidation \n\nbehavior due to the particle agglomeration by compression (CI, 1987). In addition to this, \n\na clear tendency to use particle from 0.841 mm to 0.037 mm sizes and close to 0.149 mm \n\nwas identified.  \n\n \nFigure 2 - Particle size based on the literature review to construct synthetic plugs. \n\n \nTable 2.3 presents papers where these particle size materials were used to \n\nconstruct synthetic plugs. For example, in the work of Furre and Holt (1995), two materials \n\nwith a particle size distribution centered around diameters 0.053 and 0.297 mm, were \n\ncemented with epoxy resin to construct a porous medium to study the acoustic behavior, \n\nin order to compare the permeability of synthetic sandstone samples. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSource: from author \n \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nTable 2.3 - Particle size used to construct synthetic plugs. \n \n\nParticle \nsize (mm) Reference \n\n6 (HASHMAT et al., 2016) \n2.38 (NARAYAN et al., 2016) \n\n2 (NARAYAN et al., 2016) \n1.19 (NARAYAN et al., 2016) \n\n1 (HEATH, 1965) \n0.841 (RAIMONDI; TORCASO, 1964; HEATH, 1965; CRAIGHEAD; \n\nHOSSAINI; WATSON, 1983) \n0.707 (RAIMONDI; TORCASO, 1964) \n0.595  (RAIMONDI; TORCASO, 1964; NARAYAN et al., 2016; PEI et al., \n\n2016) \n0.5 (HASHMAT et al.,2016; PEI et al., 2016)  \n0.4 (WANG et al., 2008; KARIZNOVI et al., 2008; PEI et al., 2016) \n\n0.354 (WANG et al., 2008; KARIZNOVI et al., 2008 ; PEI et al., 2016) \n0.297 (FURRE; HOLT, 1995; WANG et al., 2008; KARIZNOVI et al., 2008; \n\nNARAYAN et al., 2016; PEI et al., 2016)  \n0.25 (WANG et al., 2008; PEI et al., 2016) \n0.21 (NEMATI; VOORDOUW, 2002; WANG et al., 2008; KAWAMURA et \n\nal., 2008; PEI et al., 2016) \n0.177 (HOLT et al., 1998; WANG et al., 2008; NARAYAN et al., 2016; PEI \n\net al., 2016) \n0.149 (ARIHARA et al., 1976; WANG et al., 2008; ZHAO et al., 2010; \n\nNARAYAN et al., 2016; PEI et al., 2016) \n0.125 (LU, 1988; WANG et al., 2008; ZHAO et al., 2010;  PEI et al., 2016) \n0.105 (WILLIAMS; UNDERDOWN, 1981; ZHAO et al., 2010; PEI et al., \n\n2016) \n0.088 (WILLIAMS; UNDERDOWN, 1981; ZHAO et al., 2010; PEI et al., \n\n2016) \n0.074  (AMBA et al., 1962; CHILINGAR et al., 1970; WILLIAMS; \n\nUNDERDOWN, 1981; RANJBAR et al., 1992; NEMATI; \nVOORDOUW, 2002; NARAYAN et al., 2016; PEI et al., 2016)  \n\n0.063 (RANJBAR, 1992) \n0.053 (RANJBAR, 1992; FURRE; HOLT, 1995) \n0.044 (RANJBAR, 1992) \n0.037 (ANBAH, et al., 1965; PEI et al., 2016)  \n0.023 (ANBAH, et al., 1965; PEI et al., 2016) \n0.017 (PEI et al., 2016) \n\n \nSource: from author \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n2.5 METHODOLOGIES FOR CONSOLIDATION OF SYNTHETIC PLUGS \n \n\nThe methodology used for consolidation of the plugs was categorized into five \n\ngroups: Group 1: unconsolidated samples; Group 2: consolidated by compaction; Group \n\n3: consolidated by bonding materials; Group 4: consolidated by material solubility or \n\nprecipitation; Group 5: consolidated by materials sintering and Group 6: consolidated by \n\n3D-printed. Following items present the mentioned groups.   \n\n \n2.5.1 Group 1 \u2013 Unconsolidated samples \n \n\nA rock plug sample may be unconsolidated, as with unconsolidated sand, \n\ndepending on the oilfield properties as in the case of Wang et al. (2008). For this reason, \n\nafter a particle size analysis of reservoir rock particles, the author mixed sands of sizes \n\nbetween 0.4 and 0.125 mm, and this was used to represent the reservoir zone of interest. \n\nAnother material conforming to unconsolidated plugs was found (HASHMAT et al., \n\n2016). Here, packed glass beads of different sizes were used to study the chemical \n\ninteraction of fluids within the porous media. The author justified the control of porosities \n\nand permeabilities due to the use of glass beads and its physical standard characteristics. \n\nBased on the same packaging principle quartz sand of size 0.595-0.297 mm was used, \n\npacked in a stainless-steel tube and sterilized at 165 \u00b0 C for 3 hours. The sample was \n\nused for a fluid displacement test (XU; LU, 2011). \n\n \n2.5.2 Group 2 \u2013 Consolidation by compaction \n \n\nWithin the consolidated samples, compaction was identified as one of the \n\nmethodologies with greater application. Here, a load to the plug can be exerted in a \n\nuniaxial or triaxial way. For example, by mixing particles of sand with shale in different \n\nproportions and applying a uniaxial compaction within a metallic cell. As a result, a \n\nconsolidated rock sample can be obtained and used to analyze the dielectric constants of \n\nthe rocks (WEINAN et al., 1997). \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nIn this same way, it was proposed to obtain consolidated synthetic plugs by using \n\nunconsolidated reservoir rock samples (LUQUOT et al., 2016). The samples were \n\ndisintegrated manually to guarantee the same particle size of natural unconsolidated rock. \n\nIn the mentioned work, the aim was to compare the porosity, particle size and internal \n\nstructure of unconsolidated and synthetic plugs. It was concluded that both samples had \n\nsimilar properties. In addition, it can be emphasized that in this way, it is possible to \n\nguarantee a natural sample reproduction. \n\n \n\n2.5.3 Group 3 \u2013 Consolidation by bonding materials \n \n\nOne of the first methodologies regarding the consolidation of plugs using bonding \n\nmaterials was reported in 1999 (THOMPSON et al., 1999). This consolidation was \n\nachieved by applying a uniaxial force into a mixture of quartz and epoxy resin, during the \n\ncuring process of the epoxy. These constructed plugs were used to evaluate the \n\ncompressive strength of the plugs. It is noteworthy that properties such as porosity and \n\npermeability of these plugs were not evaluated due to its geophysics application studies. \n\nSubsequently, based on previous methodology by Thompson et al. (1999), \n\nsandstone rock plugs were constructed by Tarek (2014) aiming to simulate reservoir \n\nconditions and evaluate the xanthan gum effect on water production. Portland cement \n\nwas used instead as a bonding material. The composition of the sandstone samples was \n\n74% (w/w) sand, with particle sizes of 0.71 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.25 mm. The mixture \n\nconsisted of 14.8% (w/w) Portland cement and 11.1% (w/w) water. \n\nOn the other hand, other authors developed an equipment called EDR - Radial \n\nDisplacement Equipment, Londo\u00f1o (2010) apud Celis and Fernandez (2012) and Alarcon \n\nand Cavanzo (2013), which allowed them to simulate the physical behaviour of water and \n\nsteam injection processes in synthetic sandstone rocks. For such, synthetic samples were \n\nconstructed using sand and polyester resin as a bonding material, however, without \n\ncontrol of petrophysical properties. \n\nBased on the previous methodology of Londo\u00f1o (2010), a methodology for plug \n\nconstruction with controlled petrophysics properties (porosity and permeability) was \n\ndeveloped, by mixing different quantities of sand, white kaolin and resin epoxy (CELIS; \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nFERNANDEZ, 2012). The author concluded that a greater amount of binder material \n\ncaused lower porosities and permeabilities. Alarcon and Cavanzo (2013) adapted the \n\nmethodology used by Celis and Fernandez (2012) by using a manual compaction \n\nprocedure that allowed synthetic plugs with different petrophysics properties to be \n\nobtained, although without the control of the manual applied force. \n\nTherefore, using the same homogenized material of Alarcon and Cavanzo (2013), \n\nPadron and Lizcano (2014) standardized the compaction process by applying controlled \n\nuniaxial torques, resulting in a greater reproducibility and repeatability of the petrophysical \n\nproperties of the samples. \n\nCaceres and Porras (2015) focused their research on constructing electro-\n\npneumatic equipment that produced a more controlled and higher compaction than those \n\nobtained by Padron and Lizcano (2014). In this sense, the authors developed a \n\nmethodology correlating the applied pressure and mixture composition (sand, white \n\nkaolin, epoxy resin and water). It was concluded that samples manufactured with 100 psi, \n\nusing kaolin and sand with particle size of 0.149-0.074 mm, presented an excellent \n\nconsolidation. Additionally, porosities between 21 to 33%, and permeabiities between 40 \n\nto 470 mD, were observed. Consequently, the authors recommended the construction of \n\nhigh pressure equipment to obtain samples with lower petrophysical properties. \n\n \n\n2.5.4 Group 4 \u2013 Consolidation by material solubility or precipitation \n \n\nWithin the synthetic plug construction, the consolidation by precipitation of silica \n\nand carbonate materials was identified. \n\nHolt et al. (2003) and Brignoli et al. (1998) describe precipitation, and subsequent \n\nconsolidation, of silica by CO2 flowing in a homogeneous sand and sodium silicate \n\nsolution, which was subsequently subjected to uniaxial and confinement pressure. The \n\nauthors concluded that samples had weak mechanical properties. In turn, they emphasize \n\nthat due to the particle size distribution and precipitated material quantity, it will be possible \n\nto control the petrophysical properties. \n\nFrom another consolidation perspective by calcium carbonate, two types of \n\nmethodologies were identified: use of bacteria (biologically induced precipitation) and \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nenzyme-induced precipitation. A biologically induced precipitation, with a petroleum \n\nengineering application, was described in Ferris et al. (1992). This consolidation method \n\nemployed a flow of solution consisting of Bacillus pasteurii NRS 673 bacteria, Difco \n\nnutrient, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, anhydrous calcium chloride and \n\ndistilled water. Additionally, solvent and water stability precipitation were noted. The \n\nauthors describe a permeability reduction on porous media, due to the carbonate \n\nprecipitation. In addition, this paper emphasizes that this carbonate acted like two agents: \n\ncementer and obstructer.  \n\nVan-paassen et al. (2009) described some of the improvements that are obtained \n\nimplementing the biologically induced carbonate precipitation. In this sense, regarding \n\nconstruction of experimental plugs, the author used sand with a density of 1560 kg/m3 \n\nadded into a suspension solution of ureolitic bacteria \"sporosarcina pasteurii\", urea and \n\ncalcium chloride. After the treatment, five sample blocks were extracted by drilling, and \n\ncylindrical rock plugs with a fixed porosity value were obtained. \n\nKucharski et al. (1996 and 1997) apud Al-Shahri et al. (2010), Yasuhara et al. \n\n(2012) and Ronan (2005) describe a controlled calcium carbonate precipitation process \n\naround silicon sand. This process simulated a natural cementation rock, and used a \n\npatented aqueous solution flow at low pressure. This method titled \u201cCIPS - Calcite in-situ \n\nprecipitation system\u201d allowed synthetic sample permeability control until a given condition. \n\nIsmail et al. (2000), based on the CIPS patent, developed a technique for artificially \n\ncemented calcareous soil preparation, looking for a high cementing quality and consistent \n\ndensity of the sample. \n\nBesides, Yasuhara et al. (2012) creates another method, justifying the CIPS \n\nunknown patent solutions and the complex management of containment, extinction and \n\ngeneration of bacteria. The author describes a precipitation method using urease, urea \n\nand calcium chloride. After testing this method, it was concluded that further studies are \n\nneeded to understand how permeability and resistance can be restricted, controlling the \n\namount of precipitated calcium carbonate.  \n\nAnother method based on carbonate precipitation was described by Melo (2012), \n\nadapting the Brazilian standard \u201cNBR 7182: Construction of compacted soil samples\u201d \n\nABNT (1986) to construct a synthetic rock plug to study the behaviour of this sample in \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nthe presence of hydrochloric acid, aiming at carbon capture CO2 storage studies. For this \n\nreason, a quartz sand sample was cemented using a homogeneous aqueous calcium \n\nhydroxide and calcified green algae (halimeda), using a proportion of 50%, 25% and 25%, \n\nrespectively. Subsequently, the sample was compacted and carbonated with CO2. From \n\nthis work is important to note the author\u2019s emphasis on carbonate mineralogical \n\nreproduction, despite not reproducing petrophysical properties. \n\nPei et al. (2016) aiming to study seismic physical modelling, construct synthetic \n\nsandstone plugs applying a load force over a blend of quartz sand with controlled particle \n\nsize (from 0,6 mm to 0,02 mm) and epoxy resin. The authors explain that changes in the \n\nporosity of the synthetic plugs, probably, occurs due the described particles size and the \n\napplied load force used to consolidate the sample, but, a relationship between these \n\nconstruction parameters and the obtained porosities was not identified. \n\n \n2.5.5 Group 5 \u2013 Consolidation by materials sintering \n \n\nMani\u00e8re et al. (2017) describes a sintering process that involves a compacting heat \n\ntreatment to transform powder into a solid material by the union of its particles. For this, \n\nheat treatments are required close to the material melting temperature. Some materials \n\nwere found as a basis of consolidation by thermal sintering of materials: PTFE \n\n(Polytetrafluoroethylene) or Teflon and quartz. \n\nMccaffery and Bennion (1974) describes the methodology for constructing plugs \n\nby using PTFE or Teflon particles previously compressed in a mould, where a temperature \n\nof 371\u00b0C was applied for a sintering process to occur. Anderson (1986) explains that \n\nTeflon guarantees an inert chemical composition and low surface energy, resulting on \n\nwettability control.   \n\nWeinbrandt et al. (1969) and Farley et al. (1970) apud Mccaffery and Bennion \n\n(1974) indicate that porous media and surface of sintering PTFE samples appear like \n\nsandstone rocks. They claim this due to its pore structures at microscopic scale, rough \n\nand irregular surfaces, and uniform porosities and permeabilities. However, they did not \n\nelaborate on the surface chemical composition.  \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nRanjbar et al. (1992) describes the production of porous models by quartz particle \n\nsintering, with particle sizes between 0.04 and 0.07 mm. The author justifies the use of \n\nthis technique due to the easy cleaning procedure and reuse advantage. No concerns \n\nabout mineralogical and petrophysical parameters control were considered.  \n\n \n\n2.5.6 Group 6 \u2013 Consolidation by 3D-printed \n \n\nFrom another approach, Kong et al. (2018) manufactured synthetic plugs using 3-\n\nD printed gypsum rock and evaluated its physical properties through quantitative porosity \n\nanalyses. Their observation indicated that these manufacture rocks host spherical pores \n\nand fewer blade-shaped pores, evidencing a homogeneous pore structure. In contrast, \n\nadditionally to the mentioned by the authors about the limitation of replicate similar natural \n\nrock pore frame due to the printing resolution, it can be noted that the use of gypsum \n\npowder may not represent a complex mineralogizes found in plugs from field. In this \n\nsense, it can be another limitation of these synthetic samples when submitted to \n\ninteraction rock-fluid tests. \n\nIn a summary, the construction of synthetic carbonate plugs is viable and \n\ndependent on the selected materials and methodologies. Therefore, there is a lack of \n\nresearches focusing both mineralogical composition and petrophysical properties to \n\nreproduce a heterogeneous but controlled pore structure and chemical composition \n\ncharacteristics typical of carbonate oilfield rocks. In this way, this research presents a \n\npromising approach to obtain such plugs, aiming to contribute to the evidenced research \n\nlack. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n3 PROPOSAL FOR CARBONATE PLUG CONSTRUCTION \n \n\nPlug composition has a direct relationship with the rock chemistry, and therefore \n\nwith the behavior of the sample in the laboratory tests focused on the surface chemistry \n\nbehavior, such as wettability measurements aimed at enhanced oil recovery studies. \n\nAccording to Abdallah et al. (2007), wettability refers to the preference of a solid \n\nsurface to be in contact with a fluid, due to the equilibrium of interstitial forces (fluid-solid). \n\nIn the case of a petroleum reservoir, these forces will generate a system with preferences \n\nto be oil-wet or water-wet due to the behavior between oil, water and reservoir rock. This \n\nmeans that due to the wettability, if reservoir rock is oil-wet, higher amounts of oil can \n\nremain retained inside the reservoir rock, resulting in a negative economic situation \n\n(ALOTAIBI et al., 2010). For example, in the case of sandstone rocks, preferences to be \n\nwater-wet (PENTLAND et al., 2010; CHATZIS et al., 1988) were found, and carbonate \n\nrocks to be oil-wet (MANRIQUE et al., 2004; MASALMEH et al., 2014; PIZARRO; \n\nBRANCO, 2012) or with an intermediate wet behavior (AL-DHAHLI et al., 2011; AKKURT \n\net al., 2000) were found. \n\nBecause these plugs can be also used for advanced petrophysics studies, such as \n\nflooding or wetting measurements, it is important to choose materials which allow \n\nsynthetic carbonate samples to be built, guaranteeing their similarity to the natural ones, \n\nsuch as in studies of changing wettabilities due to the application of chemical treatments \n\nto the rock-fluid system in order to enhance oil production. \n\nTo achieve carbonate reservoir samples that reproduce the proper mineral \n\nchemistry composition, materials based on silicas and sand, as well as bonding materials \n\nbased on epoxy, resins and cements, will not be considered. Therefore, based on the \n\ndeveloped methodologies by Lakatos et al. (2003) and Luquot et al. (2016), which used a \n\ndisintegrated rock material to obtain a core plug, an adaptation is proposed that uses a \n\ndisintegrated dolomitic carbonate rock. In this way, disintegrated carbonate rock will be \n\nthe base material of synthetic plugs, guaranteeing a similar natural composition compared \n\nto the corresponding reservoir rock. Based on the previously particle size analysis by \n\nliterature, a particle size control in five intervals around the most used granulometry was \n\n\n\n 38 \n\nproposed, aiming to obtain plugs with different basic petrophysical parameters. They \n\nwere: 0.3-0.6 mm, 0.15-0.3 mm, 0.074-0.15 mm, 0.020-0.074 mm and&lt;0.020 mm. \n\nAdditionally, it is proposed to use during the construction process some bonding \n\nmaterials in low content and the increasing calcium carbonate solubility followed by \n\nprecipitation, in order to generate a natural bonding material into the particles used to \n\nconstruct the synthetic plugs. Figure 3 presents the related solubility due to the decreasing \n\nof both, pH and temperatures.  \n\n \nFigure 3 - Degree of supersaturation - CaCO3 formation \n \n \n\n \nSource: Software Frechcreek (2017) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n4 MATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n\n4.1 BASE MATERIAL - DISINTEGRATED DOLOMITIC CARBONATE  \n \n\n The base material used in this work to construct synthetic plugs was a \n\ndisintegrated dolomitic carbonate rock with controlled particle size. The base material was \n\ndisintegrated first by a jaw crusher and then by a roller crusher. Chemical analysis of the \n\ndolomitic carbonate rock used was carried out by X-ray spectrometry fluorescence in the \n\nSTD-1 (Standardless) calibration, concerning the analysis of chemical elements between \n\nfluorine and uranium. In addition, the loss on ignition (LOI) was carried out at 1020 \u00b0C for \n\n2 hours. \n\nThen, to obtain particle size intervals from 0.3-0.6 mm, 0.15-0.3 mm, 0.074-0.15 \n\nmm, 0.02-0.074mm, and&lt;0.02 mm, sieves with a known mesh (0.02mm, 0.074mm, \n\n0.15mm, 0.3mm and 0.6mm) were used.  \n\nIn cases where the quantity of the finest particle size (<0.02 mm) obtained was too \n\nlow, particle size 0.02-0.074 mm were sampled and pulverized in a Herzog pulverizer to \n\nobtain the needed material. To corroborate the true size of the finest particle material \n\nresulting from this procedure, a low angle laser light scattering measurement (Malvern \n\nMastersizer) was used to assure particle size. \n\n \n\n4.2 METHODOLOGY TO CONSTRUCT SYNTHETIC PLUGS \n \n\nTwo kinds of samples were constructed. One sample was composed of 5g of \n\ndisintegrated rock and disk geometry of 3.77 cm diameter and 0.2 cm height. It was used \n\nto screening of the different parameters before the construction of the real size plugs. The \n\nother was composed of 100 g of disintegrated rock with a plug geometry of 3.77 cm \n\ndiameter and 40 cm height and was used to reproduce the final plugs of real size with the \n\nidentified better parameters. To study the effect of particle size of the base material on \n\nconsolidation of the plugs, samples composed by a unique particle size and 1:1, 1:2, and \n\n1:3 ratios (w/w) of particle size (fine:coarse) were used as shown in Table 4.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nTable 4.1 - Particle size ratios (fine:coarse) \n\nComposed by \na unique \n\nparticle size \n(mm) \n\nParticle Sizes (mm) \nratio 1:1 \n\n(Fine:Coarse) \n\nParticle Sizes (mm) \nratio 1:2 \n\n(Fine:Coarse) \n\nParticle Sizes \n(mm) ratio 1:3 \n(Fine:Coarse) \n\n<0.02&lt;0.02 : 0.020+0.074&lt;0.02 : 0.020+0.074&lt;0.02 : \n\n0.020+0.074 \n\n0.020+0.074&lt;0.02 : 0.074+0.15&lt;0.02 : 0.074+0.15&lt;0.02 : \n\n0.074+0.15 \n\n0.074+0.15&lt;0.02 : 0.15+0.3&lt;0.02 : 0.15+0.3&lt;0.02 : 0.15+0.3 \n\n0.15+0.3&lt;0.02 : 0.3+0.6&lt;0.02 : 0.3+0.6&lt;0.02 : 0.3+0.6 \n\n0.3+0.6 0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.074+0.15 \n\n0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.074+0.15 \n\n0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.074+0.15 \n\n 0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.15+0.3 \n\n0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.15+0.3 \n\n0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.15+0.3 \n\n 0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.3+0.6 \n\n0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.3+0.6 \n\n0.020+0.074 : \n\n0.3+0.6 \n\n 0.074+0.15 : \n\n0.15+0.3  \n\n0.074+0.15 : \n\n0.15+0.3 \n\n0.074+0.15 : \n\n0.15+0.3 \n\n 0.074+0.15 : 0.3+0.6 0.074+0.15 : 0.3+0.6 0.074+0.15 : \n\n0.3+0.6 \n\n 0.15+0.3 : 0.3+0.6 0.15+0.3 : 0.3+0.6 0.15+0.3 : 0.3+0.6 \n\n \nSource: from author \n\n \n\nSamples were constructed with and without using water content to study the \n\nsample consolidation. In case where water content was used, water content of 2,4,6,8 or \n\n10 w/w relative to the base material with pH 3 or 7 were mixed with the base material. \n\nWater content of pH 3 were carried out by and hydrochloric acid solution. Additionally, \n\nsamples were constructed with and without using bonding materials to study the effect on \n\nboth consolidation and wettability properties. The proportion used of these bonding \n\nmaterials were 5% w/w and 10% w/w relative to the base material. Table 4.2 reports the \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nmaterials used to construct synthetic plugs. On the other hand, To study the effect of \n\ntemperature on the consolidation of the sample based on CaCO3 solubility, it was \n\nsubmitted to a drying temperature of 25\u00baC (room temperature) or 100\u00baC (for 1 hour into \n\nan oven).  \n\nIn this way, a base material with known particle size and particle size ratio was \n\nplaced in a plastic bag, manually mixed with the bonding material (if necessary) and the \n\nwater content pH 3 or 7 (if necessary) by 1 minute. After this, the resulting blend was \n\nplaced inside the cylindrical metallic vessel, which had previously been lubricated with an \n\nethyl alcohol solution containing 1% w/w stearic acid powder. The dimensions of this \n\nvessel were 3.77 cm internal diameter, 3.00 cm thickness and 13.00 cm height and the \n\ndimension of the piston were 3.75 cm diameter and 15.90 cm height. A load (200 kN) was \n\napplied with controlled velocity (25mm/min) two times.

The dimensions of this vessel were 3.77 cm internal diameter, 3.00 \n\ncm thickness and 13.00 cm height and the dimension of the piston were 3.75 cm diameter \n\nand 15.90 cm height. A load (200 kN) was applied with controlled velocity (25mm/min) \n\ntwo times. Subsequently, the resulting consolidated sample was placed for 1 hour into an \n\noven at 100\u00baC to guarantee a drier and higher consolidation based on CaCO3 solubility. \n\nAfter that, samples were exposed to room temperature. Photographic register of the \n\nsamples was taken at 0, 1 and 120 hours after removing from compression moulding. \n\n \n\n4.3 METHODOLOGIES TO EVALUATE SYNTHETIC PLUGS \n \n4.3.1 Immersion tests \n\n \n120 hours after removing from compression moulding, samples were submitted to \n\na water immersion test for 12 hours to evaluate their stability related to consolidation. The \n\nmain aim was to verify if such samples would not have disintegrated in this medium, which \n\ncan be used in routine plug tests such as spontaneous imbibition, fluid displacement and \n\nsaturation tests (GAAFAR et al., 2015). Photographic register of samples was done \n\nduring, and 1 hour after the test. After the test, the samples were handled to verify their \n\nconsolidation. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Wettability measurements \n \n\nAir-water and air-mineral oil contact angle measurements were done using a DSA \n\n100 Kruss drop shape analyzer at room pressure and temperature conditions. \n\nMeasurements were done on samples with a disk geometry. A drop of distilled water or \n\nmineral oil was placed on the flat surface of the sample and the contact angle was \n\nmeasured immediately and after 10 seconds.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 43 \n\n4.3.3 Gas porosimetry \n \n\nGas porosimetry is a technique based on the gas expansion which allows the \n\nmeasurement of either pore or grain volume, grain density and permeability of a rock \n\nsample (DE OLIVEIRA et al., 2016). Before the test, synthetic plugs of full size (Figure 4, \n\nthe part A) were dried for 24 hours in an oven at 60C with controlled humidity of 45%. \n\nPlugs were submitted to porosity and permeability gas (nitrogen) test with a confinement \n\npressure of 2400 psi in an Ultrapore 300 porosimeter and Ultraperm 500 permeameter. \n\nKlikenber effect was corrected to obtain porosities and permeabilities results. Grain \n\ndensity is a measure of mass per unit of volume of the elemental composition and internal \n\nbonding materials of rocks (Sch\u00f6n, 2011). From this technique grain density can be also \n\nobtained. \n\n \n\n4.3.4 Mercury injection porosimetry \n \n\nA Micromeritics AutoPore IV mercury porosimeter was used to estimate the pore \n\nsize distribution of the synthetic samples, porosity, permeability and grain density. Due to \n\nthe limitation of sample size of the technique, full size plugs cannot be analyzed. In this \n\nsense, from plugs of full size used for the gas porosimetry test, it was necessary to extract \n\na fragment rock to be study. For this reason, plugs were cut in 3 disk of 13.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm \n\nheight and extracted a fragment rock of 20 \u00b1 0.1 mm width from the central disk. (Figure \n\n4, the part B). Synthetic plugs were cutting off carefully to avoid alterations of the pore \n\nspace. After this, extracted fragments were dried for 24 hours in an oven at 100\u00baC and \n\nweight. This value was used as input data in the porosimeter software. A maximum \n\nintrusion mercury pressure of 40000 psi was used in all the tests.   \n\n \n4.3.5 Theoretical porosity calculus  \n \n\nIn addition to gas and mercury porosimetry tests, the theoretical porosity value was \n\nused as an approximation to the expected porosity and it was used to be compared with \n\nthe experimental results and calculate the deviation of the measures. It should be noted \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nthat experimental tests only access to the connected pores, in other words, the effective \n\nporosity.  \n\n \n\nTheoretical porosity was calculated as follow: \n\na) Calculus of the volume of the synthetic plugs, based on the measured diameters \n\nand heights (equation 10).  \n\n \n\n? =\t\n? ? ?Y ? ?\n\n4\n \n\n(10) \n\n \n? = Volume of the synthetic plug (cm3); \n\n? = Measured diameter of the synthetic plug (cm); \n\n? = Measured height of the synthetic plug, (cm); \n \n\nb) Calculus of the mass of the previously calculated volume of the synthetic plugs, \n\nconsidering this as a homogeneous solid without porosity (equation 11). \n\n \n?? = ? ? ?

(12) \n\n \n?? = Missing mass in the synthetic plug, considered as porous (g); \n\n?? = Mass of the synthetic plug considered as a homogenous solid without porosity \n\n(g); \n\n\n\n 45 \n\n? = Measured mass of the synthetic plug (g) ; \n \n\nd) Calculus of the volume that should be occupied by the missing mass in the \n\nsynthetic plug, considered as porous volume (equation 13). \n\n \n\n?? =\t\n??\n?\n\n (13) \n\n \n?? = Porous volume (cm3); \n\n?? = Missing mass in the synthetic plug, considered as porous (g); \n\n? = Average grain density of the synthetic plugs (g/cm3); \n \n\ne) Calculus of the expected porosity of the synthetic plug (equation 14). \n\n \n\n? =\t\n??\n?\n? 100 (14) \n\n \n? = Porosity (%); \n\n??= Porous volume (cm3); \n\n? = Volume of the synthetic plug (cm3); \n\n \n \n4.3.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) \n\nanalysis were conducted to determine the micro-structures and the identification of the \n\nsurface elements in the samples. Surface images of a fragment plug size of 20 \u00b1 0.1 mm \n\nwidth (Figure 4, the part B), cold-mounted (embedded) in epoxy resin were done at \n\nmagnifications of 21x, 100x, 350x and 1000x by using a Stereoscan 440 LEO.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 46 \n\n4.3.7 Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) \n \n\nA micro-computed tomography was used as nondestructive method of image \n\nacquisition.

Table 5.1 presents the chemical composition \n\nof the used dolomitic carbonate, obtained by X-ray spectrometry fluorescence. It is \n\nemphasized that according to Souza and Bragan\u00e7a (2013), the high concentration of the \n\ncompounds MgO (15.5%-17.2%), SiO2 (4.51%-4.06%) and CaO (36.4%-33.8%) \n\ncorresponds to dolomitic calcareous samples.  \n\n \nTable 5.1 - Chemical composition of the dolomitic carbonate used to construct synthetic plugs. \n\n \nChemical \n\ncomposition \nSample 1 Sample 2 \n\nNa2O&lt;0,001 0,059 \nMgO 15,5 17,2 \nAl2O3 0,765 0,652 \nSiO2 4,51 4,06 \nP2O5 0,014 0,018 \nSO3 0,033 0,089 \nCl 0,021 0,014 \n\nK2O 0,064 0,205 \nCaO 36,4 33,8 \nTiO2 0,043 0,028 \n\nCr2O3 0,011 0,012 \nMnO 0,103 0,046 \nFe2O3 0,564 0,579 \nNiO&lt;0,001 0,006 \nZnO 0,024&lt;0,001 \nSrO 0,018 0,014 \nZrO2 0,044 0,002 \n\nNb2O5 0,029 0,014 \nLOI 41,9 43,2 \n\n \nSource: from author \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nAfter the corroboration of the chemical composition of the mentioned dolomitic \n\ncarbonate rock, samples were disintegrated and particle size controlled by a sieve.

This consolidation behavior can be explained \n\nprobably due to favorable material agglomeration. This first exploratory test demonstrated \n\na promising preliminary result regarding the construction of real size plugs. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n 50 \n\nFigure 7 - Resulting disks varying the unique particle size at drying temperature 25\u00b0C, without \nusing water content and additional bonding material.  Uniaxial compression (200 kN; 25 mm/min). \nAfter 120 hours of construction.   \n\n \nBased on the previous results, the following samples were constructed using the \n\nproposed CaCO3 solubility. Aiming to evaluate the effect of these new parameters on plug \n\nconsolidation, the pH effect was verified by adding distilled water content with pH values \n\nof 3 and 7 (2 to 10 w/w relative to the base material) to the 5 g particle size material, \n\nfollowed by mixing for 1 minute before the compression process. The acidity of the water \n\nwas achieved by using diluted hydrochloric acid solution. \n\nThe mixture was submitted to the same uniaxial compression used on previous \n\nexploratory tests. Load force and compression times used were fixed aiming to guarantee \n\nan experimental reproducibility, and compare the resulting plugs with exploratory ones. \n\nThese samples were dried at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). Figures from the appendix A \n\npresent all of the constructed disks, at 0 and 120 hours after the consolidation process. \n\nFigure 8 presents some of the resulting disks, in order to illustrate the following analysis.  \n\nThe consolidation behavior, again, present a tendency to improve with decreasing \n\nparticle size. Figure 8, the part a and b present a resume of this improved consolidation \n\ncorresponding to the decrease of particle size for disks with the same number of water \n\ncontent (8% w/w) with a pH value 3 and 7. In addition, it was noted an effect of the time \n\nof sample drying on the consolidation behavior, getting worse over time. It is due to \n\ntemporary sample consolidations caused by the presence of humidity. On the other hand, \n\ncomparing the Figure 8 the parts a and b, a possible calcium carbonate dissolution when \n\n \n \n\n \nSource: from author. \n \n \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nusing acid water content (pH 3), followed by its probable precipitation, led to a more \n\neffective consolidation, even after 120 hours. In this way, the use of acid water would be \n\nthe most beneficial way for the construction of samples, even when using larger particle \n\nsizes. \n\nFigure 8 the part c presents a resume of the consolidation sample behavior due to \n\nthe content of water pH 7. From here, it was observed that few (2 and 4% w/w) or more \n\n(8 and 10% w/w) did not generate good material consolidation. This trend may be due to \n\nthe amount of water not being enough to impregnate all of the particle surface, or the \n\ncontent of water being too much to allow good material handling, turning it into a very \n\nweak sample. Therefore, with water content of 6% w/w the material was not excessively \n\nhumid, and the total impregnation of its particles was possible, causing a homogeneous \n\nsolubility (in the case of acidic pH) and material consolidation. Finally, water content of \n\n6% w/w, pH=3 and particle size&lt;0.02 mm seemed to generate the best disk \n\nconsolidations \n\n \n \n \nFigure 8 \u2013 The part a and b presents the resulting disks varying the unique particle size at drying \ntemperature 25\u00b0C, using 8% w/w of water content at pH 7 (A) and at pH 3 (B); uniaxial \ncompression (200 kN; 25 mm/min); without using bonding material; after 0 and 120 hours of \nconstruction.

Figures from the appendix B present all the constructed disks at 0 hours \n\n(after removing from compression moulding), 1 hour (after drying process at 100\u00b0C) and \n\n120 hours (after the consolidation process).  \n \n\nFigure 9 presents a resume of this figures from appendix B, comparing constructed \n\ndisks after 120 hours of construction, with particle size (0.074-0.150 mm), water content \n\nfrom 2 to 10 % w/w, pH value 7 and drying temperatures of 25\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C. From these \n\nsamples, it was observed a positive influence on the consolidation of the material due to \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nhigh drying temperatures. In this sense, samples with high drying temperatures (100 \u00b0C) \n\npresent a tendency to have a better consolidation than those with dried at room \n\ntemperature (25 \u00b0C). In addition, it is believed that due to the high temperature (100 \u00b0C), \n\na lower content water was retained within the sample. This made it possible to guarantee \n\na drier and more definitive consolidation. \n \n\n \nFigure 9 - Resulting disks from the unique particle size 0.074-0.150 mm; content water from 2 to \n10% w/w at pH 7; uniaxial compression (200 kN; 25 mm/min);  without using additional bonding \nmaterial; after 5 days of construction; drying temperature 25\u00b0C (A) and 100\u00b0C (B).   \n \n   A. \n\n \n \n   B. \n\n \n \nSource: from author. \n\n \n \n\nGiven the previous findings, a sample with a plug geometry were manufactured. \n\nFor this reason, the construction conditions selected to guarantee a good consolidation \n\nwere: the finest particle size material (<0,020 mm), 6% w/w of water content at pH 3 and \n\ndrying temperature of 100\u00b0C. The first synthetic plug of real size is presented in Figure \n\n10. Scratches on the lateral surface were observed, which seem to compromise the \n\nstructure of the material. These samples were sanded (sandpaper N\u00b0 600), where it was \n\nobserved that the scratches were superficial and therefore, did not affect the internal \n\nstructure of the sample. It is notable that this sample presented a good consolidation \n\n\n\n 54 \n\nbefore and after the sanding, confirming a good choice of the construction materials and \n\nmethod. \n\nAiming to evaluate the basic petrophysical properties, samples were submitted to \n\nporosity and permeability gas (nitrogen) test with a confinement pressure of 2400 psi in \n\nan Ultrapore 300 porosimeter and Ultraperm 500 permeameter, both from Corelab. For \n\nthe synthetic plug, a porosity of 25.19% +/-1% was obtained, and mean absolute \n\npermeability was 0.073 mD +/-0.022 mD. This high porosity and low permeability can be \n\nexplained as the result of small internal pores in the structure of the sample. On the other \n\nhand, due to the undamaged condition of the samples after the application of the high \n\nconfinement pressure of 2400 psi, it was concluded that sample presented good \n\nconsolidation. Additionally, grain density of this synthetic plug was calculated in order to \n\ncompare the dolomite rocks value of 2.84 g/cm3 from literature (D.M.D., 2018). In this \n\nsense, it was found a grain density for this synthetic plug of 2.87 g/cm3, corroborating the \n\nsimilarity of the synthetic sample with the natural ones. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n 55 \n\n Figure 10 \u2013 Resulting synthetic carbonate plug of real size, using the unique particle size&lt;0,020 \nmm; 6% w/w of water content at pH 3; uniaxial compression (load 200 kN; 25 mm/min); drying \ntemperature 100 \u00b0C for 1 hour; without using additional bonding material. \n\n \n\n \nSource: from author. \n \n \n \n\nBased on the observed consolidation behavior of the samples due to the use of a \n\nunique particle size, it was studied the consolidation behavior of the samples due to the \n\nuse of a combination of particle sizes. In this sense, samples with disk geometry was \n\nconstructed with the proposed particle size ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 w/w), the finest \n\n(<0.02:0.02-0.074 mm) and thickest (0.15-0.3:0.3-0.6 mm) particle sizes, 6% w/w of water \n\ncontent at pH 3 and drying temperature 100\u00b0C for 1 hour, using a uniaxial compression \n\n(200 kN; 25 mm/min) and without using additional bonding material. Figure 11 presents \n\nthese resulting disks.  \n\n\n\n 56 \n\nFrom here, considering the same particle size mixture, it was evident that a higher \n\nproportion of fines led to a tendency to obtain better consolidated disks, seen with the \n\nratio 1:1 (w/w) shown in Figure 11, 120 hours after removing from compression moulding. \n\nThe use of a higher fine particle content favors material agglomeration, improving the \n\nconsolidation of samples. Figures from appendix C presents all these constructed disks, \n\ndemonstrating the same tendency. \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Resulting disks with the finest (<0.02 : 0.02-0.074 mm) and thickest (0.15-0.3 \n: 0.3-0.6 mm) particle sizes, using the particle size ratios 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3% w/w; 6 % w/w \nof water content at pH 3; drying temperature 100\u00b0C for 1 hour; uniaxial compression (200 \nkN; 25 mm/min); without using additional bonding material.

A \n\ncontact angle of zero was caused by this absorption instead of the spreading of the water \n\ndrop. This is in contrast to the oil drop behavior in which no absorption was observed. \n\nFrom these preliminary results, such samples are not indicated as suitable to represent \n\nthe wettability behavior of carbonate samples based on contact angle measurements, \n\nfrom a known intermediate to oil-wet behavior (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 2012; MANRIQUE \n\net al., 2004; MASALMEH et al., 2014; AL-DHAHLI et al., 2011; AKKURT et al., 2000). It \n\nbased to the known air-water contact angles, where a value lower than 55\u00ba is relative to a \n\nwater-wet surface (GRATE et al., 2012). Figure from appendix D, presents all the contact \n\nangle measurements, showing this same tendency \n\nSubsequently to the contact angle measurements, water immersion tests were \n\ncarried out on the preliminary disk samples. To this end, based on the presented results \n\nfrom Figure 11, the better consolidated disks were selected (particle sizes&lt;0.02mm:0.02-\n\n0.074mm, ratio 1:1, 6% w/w of water content at pH 3, drying temperature 100\u00b0C for 1 \n\nhour, uniaxial compression (200 kN; 25 mm/min), without using additional bonding \n\nmaterial). The disks were placed into a glass flask which was then filled with water. From \n\nthere, as presented in Figure 13, it was noted that the previous proposed methodology to \n\nconstruct the samples does not guarantee the consolidation of the samples when \n\nimmersed in a water medium, probably due to the lack of cementing of the particles. Due \n\nto this challenge, it was necessary to improve this consolidation methodology aiming for \n\nboth better consolidation and stability in a water medium and wettability behavior closer \n\nto natural carbonates from a reservoir. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nFigure 13- Photograph register obtained during and after water immersion on disks constructed \nwith particle size&lt;0.02:0.02-0.074  mm; particle size ratio 1:1 w/w; 6% w/w of water content at pH \n3; drying temperature 100\u00b0C for 1 hour; uniaxial compression (200 kN; 25 mm/min); Without \nadditional bonding material.

Results are presented in Figure 16. A tendency to generate higher \n\ncontact angles for water was observed with both bonding materials, and not changes was \n\nobserved to the oil. For commercial amide wax, higher water contact angles were obtained \n\nwhen using the higher (10%) content of bonding materials. To interpret these results, it is \n\nconsidered that an intermediate wettability is relative to air-water contact angles in the \n\nrange of approximately 55\u00ba to 80\u00ba, while values lower than 55\u00ba or higher than 80\u00ba are \n\nrelative to water-wet and oil-wet, respectively, as shown by Grate et al. (2012). In this \n\nsense, the obtained sample disks show an intermediate wetting behavior which is closer \n\nto the known intermediate and oil-wet carbonates from oilfields (PIZARRO; BRANCO, \n\n2012; MANRIQUE et al., 2004; MASALMEH et al., 2014; AL-DHAHLI et al., 2011; \n\nAKKURT et al., 2000). \n\n \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nFigure 16- Resulting air-water and air-mineral oil contact angle measurement at times 0 and 10 \nseconds of the disks constructed with the finest&lt;0.02:0.02-0.074 mm particle size; particle size \nratio 1:1 w/w; 6 % w/w of water content at pH 3; drying temperature 100\u00b0C for 1 hour; uniaxial \ncompression (200 kN; 25 mm/min); different bonding materials and varying content of 5% and 10% \nw/w relative to the base material; measurements obtained after 120 hours of the sample \nconstruction. \n\n \n \nSource: from author. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nThat fact, in addition with the better consolidation of the samples observed in the \n\nprevious step, justifies the use of bonding materials to construct synthetic plugs to \n\nreproduce wettability properties.

Figure 18 presents these results. A tendency to \n\nobtain greater contact angles from water drops compared with oil drops was observed, \n\nprobably due to the presence of the organic character of the bonding material. In addition, \n\nin comparison with the plugs constructed without bonding material, water contact angles \n\nfor both particle mixtures decreased slowly with time, indicating slower water absorption \n\ndue to the presence of the commercial amide wax powder. \n\nPlugs constructed with the thickest particles show water contact angle greater than \n\nones with the finest particles. In this study, different visual surface roughness was \n\nobserved relative to the particle size used to construct them, i.e. the more roughness was \n\nobserved when using the thickest particles sizes. Alotaibi (2010) explains that solid \n\nsurface will affect the contact angle due to the roughness and heterogeneity of the solid \n\nsurface.

It is expected that the main contribution \n\nto the grain density of the synthetic plugs corresponded to the base material used to \n\nconstruction. Thus, the expected grain density corresponds to the related in the literature \n\nfor dolomite rocks 2,84 g/cm3 (D.M.D., 2018). Due to the low density of the wax, synthetic \n\nplugs using bonding material showed lower grain density in comparison with the one \n\nconstructed without it. This expected behavior was confirmed with the resultant grain \n\ndensities by gas and mercury porosimetry, where samples with bonding material shows \n\nan average of 2,64 and 2,62 g/cm3, and sample without bonding material (P10) of 2,87 \n\nand 2,84 g/cm3, respectively. \n\nTable 5.3 presents the theoretical (item 4.3.5) and experimental petrophysics \n\nresults obtained by gas and mercury porosimetry and its relative error, based on the \n\ntheoretical value. From here, based on the theoretical porosity calculated for synthetic \n\nplugs with bonding material, it was observed expected values from 12.99% to 19.88% for \n\nparticle size ratio 1:1 and 12.41% to 18.31% for particle size ratio 1:3. In this sense, it was \n\nnot observed evidences of relationship between porosity and the particle size ratios.  \n\n\n\n 70 \n\nSubsequently, a tendency to the decreasing of porosity with the decrease of \n\nparticle sizes used to construct the synthetic plugs was observed. Considering the \n\npreviously explained calculus, theoretical porosity has a direct relationship with the \n\nvolume of the sample and grain density. In this sense, considering that all the constructed \n\nsynthetic plugs have a similar grain density, the calculated porosity was influenced by the \n\nobserved decreasing heights (Table 5.2) with the increasing of the particle size. It due to \n\nthe packing of the particles used to construct the synthetic plugs. In this way, the largest \n\nthe particle size, the higher the difference of size between particles. It causes a better \n\npack of the smaller particles into the empty spaces between the larger particles, thus \n\nreducing the bulk volume occupied by the particles. Additionally, it is important to mention \n\nthat comparing the synthetic plugs with and without (P10) bonding material, it was \n\nobserved that maximum porosities are obtained in the absence of the commercial amide \n\nwax, with a value of 19,71%, probably because the bonding material is not entering into \n\nthe pore spaces of the plug. \n\nTo generate a better understand of the pore structure and therefor porosities and \n\npermeabilities, the correlation between experimental tests were discussed following.  \n\nBased in the observed tendency of theoretical porosity, it was analyzed the \n\nexperimental petrophysical results obtained from gas and mercury porosimetry. The same \n\ntendency to decrease porosity with the decreasing of particle sizes used to construct the \n\nsynthetic plugs was observed for the experimental test. In this way, porosities of the \n\nconstructed plugs with bonding materials was found from 10.43% to 17.23% and 10.32% \n\nto 14.67% for particle size ratio 1:1 and 1:3 w/w respectively, based on the gas \n\nporosimetry and values and values from 11.27% to 19.96% and 11.39% to 15.36% for \n\nparticles size ratios 1:1 and 1:3 w/w respectively, based on the mercury porosimetry. \n\nAdditionally, it was observed higher relative errors from the gas porosimetry compared to \n\nthe mercury porosimetry. It can be due probably to the higher intrusion pressure applied \n\nby the mercury porosimetry than gas porosimetry, allowing the identification of smaller \n\npore sizes.  \n\nOn the other hand, based on the permeability results obtained by the two \n\nexperimental techniques, it was observed a tendency to increase permeabilities with the \n\n\n\n 71 \n\nincreasing of particle size, contrary to the found for the porosity. To explain these \n\nbehaviors, pore size distribution was studied.  \n \n\n \nTable 5.3 \u2013 Grain density, theoretical and measured porosities and permeabilities of the \nconstructed synthetic plugs presented in the the Figure 19. \n\n \nParticl\ne size \nratio \n\nSampl\ne \n\nTheoretic\nal \n\nporosity \n(%) \n\nGas porosimetry Mercury porosimetry  \nGrain \n\ndensity \n(g/cm3) \n\nPorosit\ny (%) \n\n% Rel. \nError \n\nPermeabilit\ny (mD) \n\nGrain \ndensity \n(g/cm3) \n\nPorosit\ny (%) \n\n% Rel. \nError \n\nPermeability \n(mD) \n\n1:1 \n\nP1 19.24 2.63 17.07 11,28 0.073 2.6019 19.96 3,74 0.021 \nP2 19.88 2.63 17.23 13,33 0.093     \nP3 15.45 2.64 13.18 14,69 0.461 2.5915 13.77 10,87 0.077 \nP4 15.92 2.61 13.77 13,51 0.450     \nP5 13.62 2.65 11.72 13,95 0.600 2.6044 12.77 6,24 0.140 \nP6 13.99 2.61 12.11 13,44 0.578     \nP7 13.00 2.63 10.66 18,00 0.671 2.6466 11.27 13,31 0.274 \nP8 12.99 2.64 10.43 19,71 0.723     \n\n1:3 \n\nP9 18.31 2.64 14.67 19,88 0.131 2.6354 15.36 16,11 0.038 \nP10 19,71 2.87 22.19 12,58 1.112 2.843 25.62 29,98 0.317 \nP11 14.33 2.65 12.04 15,98 0.423 2.6317 14.21 0,84 0.099 \nP12 15.11 2.62 13.27 12,18 0.397     \nP13 14.06 2.66 10.85 22,83 0.656 2.6781 14.78 5,12 0.353 \nP14 14.32 2.63 11.40 20,39 0.524     \nP15 12.41 2.64 10.47 15,63 0.717 2.6065 11.39 8,22 0.289 \nP16 12.61 2.64 10.32 18,16 0.683     \n\n \nSource: from author \n \n\nPore size distribution was studied using the mercury porosimetry by cumulative \n\nmercury injection volume with gradual increasing pressures. Figure 20 presents the \n\nresulted pore size distribution of samples constructed using bonding materials and particle \n\nsize ratios of 1:1 and 1:3 w/w. It demonstrates that most pore size lay in the in the micro-\n\nrange of 0.01-10 \u00b5m. From this result, it was observed in the two particle size ratios \n\nincreases of the pore size distribution with the increasing of the particles size used to \n\nconstruct the synthetic plugs. This pore size behavior, in addition with the found porosities \n\nand permeabilities, can be explained by:  the previously mentioned packing of the particles \n\nand the accessibility to previously closed pores into the particles due to the reduction of \n\nthe particle size. In this sense, these two factors may be causing the increasing of porosity, \n\ndecreasing of pore size distribution and therefore, decreasing of permeability of the \n\nsynthetic plugs with the decreasing of the particle size used to construct the synthetic \n\nplugs.  \n\n\n\n 72 \n\nFigure 20 - Pore size distribution of the synthetic plug constructed presented in the Figure 19 with \nparticle size ratio 1:1 (a) and 1:3 (b); measurements obtained after 120 hours of the sample \nconstruction. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSource: from author \n\n \n \n\n \n\n0\n\n0,05\n\n0,1\n\n0,15\n\n0,2\n\n0,25\n\n0,001 0,01 0,1 1 10 100 1000\n\nIn\ncr\n\nem\nen\n\nta\nl I\n\nnt\nru\n\nde\nd \n\nPo\nre\n\n S\npa\n\nce\n (f\n\nra\nct\n\nio\nn)\n\nPore Throat Radius (um) \n\nParticle size ratio 1:1\n\nP1\n\nP3\n\nP5\n\nP7\n\n0\n\n0,05\n\n0,1\n\n0,15\n\n0,2\n\n0,25\n\n0,001 0,01 0,1 1 10 100 1000\n\nIn\ncr\n\nem\nen\n\nta\nl I\n\nnt\nru\n\nde\nd \n\nPo\nre\n\n S\npa\n\nce\n (f\n\nra\nct\n\nio\nn)\n\nPore Throat Radius (um) \n\nParticle size ratio 1:3\n\nP9\n\nP11\n\nP13\n\nP15\n\na. \n\nb. \n\n\n\n 73 \n\nOn the other hand, in order to get detailed understanding of the internal distribution \n\nof the bonding material in the synthetic plugs, one sample were examined by SEM.

Additionally, the point 3 presented the material with lower atomic number. The \n\nhigher content of carbon on this point, may be due to the nature of the commercial amide \n\nwax used to construct the plugs, in addition to the epoxy resin in a porous area. In addition, \n\nit was focusing the area where probably bonding material is located. Figure 21 the part b, \n\npresent this characterization.

From these samples, sub \n\nsamples were extracted as shown in the Figure 4 to acquire the micro-CT images.   \n\n The acquired images from this technique are presented in the Figure 22. From the \n\nprocessing of the acquired images from the micro-CT, it was separated the two \n\nconformant elements of the synthetic plugs: the disintegrated rock and the bonding \n\nmaterial. Based on the previous SEM analyses, it was adopted that the first is in grayscale \n\nand the latter in color blue. From here, it was observed homogeneous distribution of the \n\nbonding material in the samples with coarse particles size and larger conglomerates in \n\nthe samples with the finest particle. Probably, it occurs due to the packing of the rock \n\nparticles causing different distributions of the bonding material. From another approach, \n\nthis evidence may be caused due to a poor mixture of the used elements to construct the \n\n\n\n 76 \n\nsynthetic plugs.

In this sense, the obtained petrophysical results by gas porosimetry may represent \n\na more faithful measurement of the whole volume.  \n\nThe following procedure was constructed to use Figure 23 and Figure 24, in order \n\nto manufacture the synthetic carbonate plugs:  \n\n1. Select a petrophysical property to be reproduced by the synthetic plugs: \n\nporosity or permeability. \n\n2. Select a value of porosity or permeability value to be reproduced. \n\n3. Identify the selected porosity or permeability value in the graphs of particle \n\nsize of ratio 1:1 w/w or 1:3 w/w. \n\n4. Once the value is identified on the y axis, observe the associated value \n\ncorresponding to the x axis. \n\n5. Use the Table 5.4 to obtain the combination of particles size to be used in \n\nthe construction of the synthetic plugs. \n\n \nTable 5.4 \u2013 Identification of the particle size based on the identified number on the x axis from \nFigure 23 and Figure 24.  \n\n \nIdentified number on the x axis Particle size (mm) \n\n1&lt;0.02  : 0.02-0.074 \n2 0.02-0.074 : 0.074 \u2013 0.15 \n3 0.074-0.15 : 0.15-0.3 \n4 0.15-0.3 : 0.3-0.6 \n\n \nSource: from author. \n\n \n\n6.

However, without \n\nreproducing a heterogeneous pore structure normally present in natural samples. On the \n\nother hand, wettability properties of the resulted synthetic plugs were similar to the natural \n\ncarbonate plugs.  \n\nRegardless the porous heterogeneous structure of natural carbonate samples, an \n\nattempt to relate particle size and petrophysical characteristics of the synthetic plugs was \n\npresented. In this sense, synthetic carbonate plugs can be reproduced correlating a \n\ndisintegrated carbonate rock matrix. \n\nConsidering the limitations of the existing methodologies to construct synthetic \n\ncarbonate plugs, the presented methodology demonstrates a promising way to be \n\nexplored in order to generate further studies to understand carbonate oilfields. This \n\npromising result makes viable the construction of synthetic carbonate plugs and the use \n\nof this samples in laboratory tests where petrophysical properties of the sample are not a \n\nconcern, which is not the case of core flooding tests. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 81 \n\n7 FUTURE WORKS \n \n\nWith the purpose of construct a more representative plug similar to the natural \n\nones, a combination of methodologies to generate heterogeneous pore structures and \n\nhigher petrophysics properties should be explored. Additionally, it is suggested to use \n\ndrilling cuttings from carbonate reservoirs as base material to construct synthetic plugs.  \n\nOn the other hand, the constructed carbonate plugs should be compared with \n\nnatural samples to evaluate the behavior of this synthetic samples in tests such as \n\nadvanced petrophysics studies such as core flooding.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 82 \n\n8 REFERENCES \n \n\nABDALLAH, W.; BUCKLEY, J.
