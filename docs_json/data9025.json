We focused on the evolution of landforms as a key factor in the configuration of alluvial \nand colluvial sequences. The geomorphological and sedimentological studies indicate that the \ndistribution of landforms is a main factor to understand the formation of colluvial soils. Granitic \nmacroforms dominate the present landscape, constituted by alveolar depressions surrounded by \ncrests and slabs. The thickest sedimentary deposits were found in the depressions. We identified \ntwo main stratigraphic units: a basal inorganic layer represented by alluvio -colluvial sediments, \nformed in a highly energetic environment, probably dating to the Younger Dryas (>11000 years BP), \nand a younger unit of thick sandy, blackish, organic matter rich, colluvium. The oldest radiocarbon \nage obtained for this unit indicates that it may have started to form by 11240 -11130 cal. BP. The \nHolocene colluvial soils show discontinuities in grain size, soil reaction, elemental composition of the \ninorganic phase and molecular composition of the soil organic matter. These features are evidence of \nthe occurrence of several phases of erosion/sedimentation (i.e. landscape instability), some of which \nwere coeval with known periods of Holocene abrupt climate change \u2013 the 8.2 ka event, the beginning \nof the Neoglaciation (ca. 6 ka BP) or the 2.8 ka wet/cold event. But some of the most intense phases \ncoincided with increased human pressure on landscape during the Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman \nPeriod, and the Middle Ages. Charcoal layers, burnt soil layers and the highly aromatic nature of the \nsoil organic matter point to frequent fire episodes. Pollen studies also indicated a sharp decrease in \nforest cover beginning by ca. 6000 cal BP, which seems to have been accompanied by a progressive \nsoil acidification with time. Our research suggests that both climate and human activities played an \nimportant role in the formation of colluvial deposits in the area, confirming that they are valuable \ngeoarchives of Holocene environmental change from a geoarchaeological approach. \n\nKey ?words: Geoarchaeology; Geoarchives; Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction; Holocene.\n\nResumo: Neste trabalho estudaram -se os dep\u00f3sitos sedimentares na \u00e1rea da esta\u00e7\u00e3o arqueol\u00f3gica \nde Campo Lameiro (NW Espanha), com o objetivo de avaliar o seu potencial para a reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n1 Institute of Heritage Sciences (Incipit).

INTRODUCTION\n\nGeoarchaeology applies techniques and methods of the Human Sciences and \nGeosciences to reconstruct landscape evolution at different geographical scales. \nHuckleberry (2000), slightly modifying the perspective offered by Gifford &amp; Rapp \n(1985), defines geoarchaeology  -as \u201cthe application of Earth Science method and \ntheory to understanding the human past\u201d, a definition broad enough to include experts \nfrom a range of scientific backgrounds to contribute towards the comprehension of \nhuman prehistory. The recent application of Earth Science techniques for the analysis \nof soils and sediments at archaeological sites has generated new levels of understanding \nof human activities and use of the landscape. Soils and sediments are composed of \nsimilar components, and form a continuum over the landscape. Their study can reveal \nhow humans in prehistory used it and defined space through their activities. However, \nthe techniques do not fully address several persistent problems associated with \nmaking inferences about past human activity from soils. The presence or absence of \nelements alone may be inadequate to effectively understand the relationship between \nsoil properties and pedogenic, diagenetic and/or anthropogenic processes. As a \nresult, multi -method approaches are becoming standard practice in pedoarchaeology \n(Walkington 2010). \n\n\n\n5 3\n\nReconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  \nan interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology\n\nSoil is an archive that can be used to interpreted archaeological deposits (Mandel &amp; \nBettis 2001). Soil processes can contribute to an understanding of archaeological sites \nbecause the soil can act as an archive in a variety of ways (Walkington 2010): (a) soils \nrepresent process -response systems through the unique interaction of the soil forming \nfactors at a particular site; (b) soils reflect soil processes occurring both vertically \nand laterally; (c) soils can store palaeoecological indicators such as pollen, phytoliths, \nbones, etc, and are thus archives of environmental change (Lowe &amp; Walker 2006); (d) \nsoils are geoarchives, even when transport has occurred, the resulting colluvial soils \ncan still store environmental information (Leopold &amp; V\u00f6lkel 2007); and (e) soils can \nrecord human use and management of a landscape.\n\nA pedogeomorphological approach at a landscape scale (Gerrad 1992) linked \nto multiproxy indicators for dating and climate reconstruction can help to track \npast processes in detail. Surface formations contain information inherent in their \ngeomorphological evolution. Climate and human activities played an important role in \nthe formation of the alluvial - colluvial deposits. The geomorphological data together \nwith other palaeoenvironmental proxies define them as useful geoarchives for the \nreconstruction of Holocene environmental change (Costa -Casais et al. 2008). Colluvial \nsoils, given their wide distribution and the time expand covered by them, may also \nbe crucial to decipher and understand human responses to climate change and the \nimpact of anthropogenic activities on the environment at the local and regional scales \n(Leopold &amp; V\u00f6lkel 2007).\n\nThis work is part of an interdisciplinary study made in the area of the Rock Art Park \nof Campo Lameiro (Galicia, NW Spain). In this survey the Earth Science\u00b4s disciplines \nplayed a major role in complementing the archaeological research. Our paper focuses \non the evolution of landforms \u2013 rocky substrate, sediments and soils \u2013 as a key \nfactor for geoarchaeological analysis, with the objective to evaluate the potential of \nsedimentary deposits to be used for the reconstruction of Holocene environmental \nchanges. This approach is particularly important in the studied area because of the \nscarcity of available archaeological remains. Granite landforms, soils and sediments \nare unique archives that have recorded transformations in the landscape linked to \ncultural evolution (Costa -Casais et al. 2009).\n\n2. REGIONAL SETTING \n\nThe study area is located within Rock Art Park of Campo Lameiro (Pontevedra-\n-Galicia, NW Spain), on the upper part of the Monte Paradela hill (330 m a.s.l.) and 25 \nkm E of the Atlantic Ocean, in the Eurosiberian (Atlantic) phytogeographic region (Fig. \n1). The area appears as an almost isolated hill, at the centre of the watershed, defined \nby the river network, and surrounded by fractures running from N -S and E -W as well \nas by numerous joints that break the substrate running N -S, EW, NW -SE and NE -SW. \nThe lithology is homogenous throughout the park. It is comprised of two mica granitic \nrocks with megacrystals of K -feldspars, with minerals showing a certain degree of \n\n\n\n5 4\n\nManuela Costa -Casais, Antonio Mart\u00ednez Cortizas, Joeri Kaal,  \nMaria Isabel Caetano Alves &amp; Felipe Criado -Boado\n\norientation towards the north of the area (IGME,1982a, 1982b). The general rolling \ntopography, with tops and troughs, is the result of a combination of granitic macro \nand microforms. Granitic modelling dominates the slopes, with granitic outcrops \nseparated by small thalwegs.\n\nIt is an area of transition between the coast and mountain range, with temperate humid \nclimate. Present mean annual temperature is 14.5 \u00b0C, and mean annual precipitation is \n1500 mm (Mart\u00ednez Cortizas &amp; P\u00e9rez Alberti 1999). Current vegetation of the site is a \nmosaic of pine (Pinus pinaster), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), heather (Calluna \nvulgaris), Erica spp. and herbaceous species. Along the valleys, the riverside vegetation is \nmainly composed of common alder (Alnus glutinosa), hazel (Corylus avellana), Quercus \nrobur and birch (Betula alba). Cultivated land is located within a distance of 300 m, at \nlower elevations. \n\n3. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nGeoarchaeology applies techniques and methods of the Human Sciences and \nGeosciences to reconstruct landscape evolution at different geographical scales. \nThese include several disciplines of the Earth Science, related to the study of the \n\nFig. 1. Location of the study area indicating the sectors cited in the text.\n\n\n\n5 5\n\nReconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  \nan interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology\n\nfossil \u2013 plant and animal \u2013 record and those dedicated to the study of the material \nremains of cultures. The study on past environmental changes in the Rock Art \nPark of Campo Lameiro has been carried out using the colluvial formations to \nreconstruct changes in the landscape. The disciplines involved in the study were: \n(a) disciplines of Earth Sciences: geomorphology, sedimentology, pedology, \ngeochemistry, mineralogy, as well as computer techniques applied to geographic \nstudies and geographic information systems; (b) disciplines that are responsible for \nstudying the fossil or subfossil record: palynology and anthracology; (c) disciplines \nthat deal with the study of material culture remains: archaeology and prehistory. \nThe archives showed information about past soil erosion and landscape change. \nThe signals are geomorphological features, morphological soil features, physico-\n-chemical properties, changes in elemental and mineral composition, information \n\nFig. 2. Steps followed in the multi -archive, multi -proxy, approach to palaeoenvironmental reconstruc-\ntion in NW Iberia. Modified from Mart\u00ednez Cortizas (2000).\n\n\n\n5 6\n\nManuela Costa -Casais, Antonio Mart\u00ednez Cortizas, Joeri Kaal,  \nMaria Isabel Caetano Alves &amp; Felipe Criado -Boado\n\non past vegetation, etc. Methodological point of view, the study was divided into \nfour phases, following the guidelines suggested by Mart\u00ednez Cortizas (2000) (Fig. 2). \n\nThe first phase implied an inventory of all available information about the area \n(maps, climatic data, geology, hydrography, previous studies, etc.), which aided to \nthe current understanding of the peculiarities of the landscape under study. This \nphase was the basis for setting the strategies to follow in the planning the work. \n\nIn a second phase, fieldwork was carried out in order to differentiate landforms. \nThe work started with the interpretation of aerial photographs, to define relief units \n\nFig. 3. Georeferenced trenches, soil profiles and rock art pannels were incorporated into a digital \nterrain model to conform a GIS database. Modified from Costa -Casais et al. (2009). \n\n\n\n5 7\n\nReconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  \nan interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology\n\nand how they are related to the regional geomorphologic context. This information \nwas used for designing and subsequent opening of 43 ditches in ten sectors, \nwith a total length of 2.5 km. Two main criteria were followed: (a) the variety of \nmorphological units, their location in sectors prone to sediment/soil accumulation, \nin erosive/accumulative or erosive areas, and (b) their proximity to the rock carvings. \nSystematic descriptions of the sedimentary facies were made in order to define the \nvertical and lateral stratigraphic changes. More detailed descriptions were performed \nfor a small number of sedimentary sequences in each ditch, which generally coincided \nwith the deepest ones and showing the greatest diversity of facies. The location of the \ntrenches, the sedimentary sequences and the rock art panels were incorporated into \na digital terrain model, then combined with the information obtained from the other \ndisciplines involved \u2013 geomorphology, archaeology and pedology \u2013 to conform a GIS \ndatabase (Costa -Casais et al. 2009) (Fig. 3). \n\nIn the third phase, eleven pedo -sedimentary sequences (with depths between 1.5 \nand 3 m) were selected for high -resolution sampling of soils and sediments. Of these, \nfive were studied in more detail. Sampling was systematic and took into account the \nvariability of each sediment layer or soil cycle. \n\nThe fourth phase concerned the analytical procedures. These included abiotic \n(physico -chemical properties: soil reaction, elemental composition of the inorganic \nphase, mineralogy, etc.) and biotic (pollen record, charcoal, molecular composition of \nthe organic matter, etc.) proxies. In a relatively small area several colluvial formations \nwere analysed and supported by extensive radiocarbon dating. \n\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n4.1. Geomorphological context: granite landscape\n\nThe landscape of the study area is dominated by granite outcrops separated by \nsmall thalwegs. The tops are organized following a polygonal pattern resulting from \nlong -term granite weathering that is controlled by a joint system running from N -S and \nE -W directions. This tectonic pattern defines an alignment with a series of tops and \ngranitic slabs interspersed with small low -lying areas known as alveolar depressions or \nalveoli (Fig. 4). The lithological, structural and geomorphological variety corresponds \nto that of granitic landforms, classified into two groups, depending on their size. The \nmegaforms or large -scale forms are divided into convex \u2013 castle -kopje, tor, block \u2013 \nlocated in a high topographic position, and concave forms \u2013 alveoli or weathering \nbasins \u2013 at lower topographic positions. The microforms or smaller forms, consist of: \n(a) microforms without any evident relationship to the rock structure \u2013 linear forms \n(gutters) and pointed forms (gnammas, tafone); and (b) microforms with an evident \nrelationship with the rock structure \u2013 linear forms (polygonal cracking, nerviate \nforms), and flat forms (broken blocks) (Godard 1977; Twidale 1986, 1989). At an \nintermediate topographic position are the granitic slabs, minor forms that are related \n\n\n\n5 8\n\nManuela Costa -Casais, Antonio Mart\u00ednez Cortizas, Joeri Kaal,  \nMaria Isabel Caetano Alves &amp; Felipe Criado -Boado\n\nto the structure of the rock (mainly joints), flat in shape and slightly tilted down. \nGranitic macroforms dominate the landscape, constituted by alveolar depressions \nsurrounded by crests and granitic slabs. The rock art panels of Os Carballos and Os \nCogoludos are good examples, carved on slabs, in which the joints, narrow channels \nand other linear features are observed (Costa -Casais et al. 2009).\n\nGranite morphogenesis is the result of the interaction of a number of factors: rock \ntype, tectonics, climatic changes, human activities and the associated morphogenetic \nsystems, which acted either directly or indirectly on the granitic substrate to form \n\nFig. 4. The tops are organized following a polygonal pattern resulting from long -term granite wea-\nthering that was controlled by a joint system running from N -S and E -W directions. Modified from \nCosta -Casais et al. (2009). \n\n\n\n5 9\n\nReconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  \nan interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology\n\nthe present landforms seen in Campo Lameiro. Alveolar depressions are the most \nrepresentative major landforms. Their formation, as already mentioned, has been \ncontrolled by the joint system that channelled both the upwards and downwards \nalteration processes (hydrothermal/thermal), and the downwards weathering and \npedogenetical processes (Vidal Roman\u00ed 1989). Their final shape is also linked to fluvial \nand alluvial processes that gradually uncovered the megaforms. These alveoli are \ncovered by alluvial -colluvial deposits and colluvial soils. They played a decisive role in \nthe preservation of sedimentary sequences in Campo Lameiro.\n\n4.2. Sedimentary sequences: alluvial deposits and colluvial soils\n\nThe thickest sedimentary deposits are located in the alveolar depressions, where \nsedimentation was favoured over erosion. The alveoli shape types have conditioned the \nevolution of the surface formation. Depending on where they are located, superficial \nformations can be classified into four main groups: (a) erosive ?cumulative alveoli: \nsituated in high potential energy areas prone to both erosion and sedimentation in \ncomparable intensities; (b) coalescing alveoli: located in low energy areas where \naccumulation dominated, such as the channelled depressions; (c) asymmetric alveoli: \nformations that cover alveoli found at intermediate positions, located next to the base \nof a granite slab and with their external border eroded; and (d) type alveoli: covered \nalveoli floors (Costa -Casais et al. 2008) (Fig. 5). The sedimentary sequences show two \ntypes of stratigraphic units: a basal inorganic sedimentary layer, covering the granitic \nsubstrate or the deeply weathered saprolite, with varying thickness (50 to 100 cm) and \na younger, thicker (up to 250 cm) layer represented by colluvial, polycyclic soils, rich \nin organic matter. \n\nThe basal inorganic sedimentary unit is the result of the erosion and transport of \nthe strongly weathered saprolite mantle, generating a large amount of material. The \nmineralogical composition, shape of the clasts, degree of weathering and the type of \nfine matrix refers to a morphogenetic system controlled by water. The sedimentary \nfacies are quite varied. There are heterogeneous and chaotic layers: cross -bed, linear \nstructures and lenticular sand layers, related to alluvial transport, which are only \npreserved in alveoli bottoms (Costa -Casais et al. 2009) (Fig. 6). They were formed \nunder an alluvial morphogenetic system, probably as small alluvial fans, with three \nmain channels following the natural thalwegs in the area (Fig. 7). Fans are dynamic \nsystems that can temporarily store sediments (G\u00f3mez Villar 1996) as a result of a \nsporadic yet continuous supply, in geological terms, in a highly energetic environment. \nAlluvial fans depend equally on torrential rainfall and its ability to produce large \namounts of sediment. At PRD -I (Fig. 6) this basal unit is fossilized by a palaeosol \nthat provided a radiocarbon age of 8480 -8320 cal BP (Costa -Casais et al. 2009) and \nin PRD -IV (Fig. 6) it is covered by a soil cycle dating back to ca. 11260 -10905 cal BP \n(Kaal et al. 2011), indicating that the fans are at least late Pleistocene or early Holocene \nin age. Their formation in the study area may be associated with the Younger Dryas \n\n\n\n6 0\n\nManuela Costa -Casais, Antonio Mart\u00ednez Cortizas, Joeri Kaal,  \nMaria Isabel Caetano Alves &amp; Felipe Criado -Boado\n\n(11000 -10000 BP), a severe coold spell with rainy conditions, as represented in \nsedimentary levels by important alluvial -colluvial accumulations that are well defined \nin the northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Mart\u00ednez Cortizas &amp; Moares Dom\u00ednguez 1995; \nValc\u00e1rcel D\u00edaz 1998). This is consistent with recent research on fluvial activity in Spain \nthat suggests increased activity by 11170 -10230 BP and 9630 -8785 BP (Thorndycraft \n&amp; Benito 2006).\n\nFig. 5. Different types of small depressions (alveoli) identified in the Campo Lameiro Rock Art Park \narea. The eroded soil from the slopes was accumulated in these reduced areas named \u201calveoli\u201d, where \nsedimentation was favoured. Modified from Costa -Casais et al. (2008). \n\n\n\n6 1\n\nReconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  \nan interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology\n\nThe younger unit is represented by colluvial layers that show an apparently \nhomogeneous morphology: black to dark brown A horizons (mineral soil rich \nin organic matter), loamy sand to sandy loam texture, with abundant quartz and \nmuscovite, acidic and with high C/N ratios. Nonetheless these soils exhibit significant \nvertical changes in grain size, charcoal layers, burnt soil layers, pH, elemental \ncomposition of inorganic phase (Ti, Zr, Fe, Al). Also, the highly aromatic nature of \nthe soil organic matter, originating from pyrogenic material formed during palaeofires \npoints towards recurrent fire episodes (Kaal et al. 2008). Sedimentary and geochemical \nfeatures, supported by extensive radiocarbon dating, are evidence of the occurrence \nof several phases of erosion/sedimentation (i.e. landscape instability), some of which \nwere coeval with known periods of Holocene abrupt climate change \u2013 the 8.2 ka \nevent, the beginning of the Neoglaciation (ca. 5500 ka BP) and the 2.8 ka wet/cold \nevent (Costa -Casais et al. 2009). But some of the most intense phases coincided with \nincreased human pressure on the landscape during the Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman \nPeriod, and the Middle Ages.\n\nFig. 6.

Landscape change vs induced environmental changes \n\nColluvial soil dynamics\nMart\u00ednez Cortizas et al. (2009a, 2012) analyzed changes in soil accumulation/\n\nerosion rates in the Rock Art Park of Campo Lameiro \u2013 in a relatively small area (less \nthan 1 km2) \u2013 using several colluvial formations and based on high -resolution sampling \nof soils and sediments and extensive radiocarbon dating. The record of average soil \naccumulation rates revealed sixteen erosion/accumulation periods, eight of them \n\nFig. 7. The location of the granite outcrops and the alveolar depressions defines three main flow paths \nwithin the area that channelized the transport of water and sediments to the valleys. Modified from \nCosta -Casais et al. (2009).\n\n\n\n6 3\n\nReconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  \nan interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology\n\nwith an equivalent accumulation rate greater than 10 tm ha -1 a1 (Fig. 8). The estimated \nduration of these phases was between 410 and 130 years, except the oldest one, which \nmay have lasted for 500 years. The length of these phases seems to have decreased \nsubstantially in two steps: one around 6500 cal BP and other one around 2700 cal \nBP. The average duration prior to 6500 cal BP was 600 years, between 6500 and 2700 \ncal BP was 310 years and after 2700 cal BP it was 160 years (Fig. 8). As a result of \nincreased erosion the transport of soil and sediments caused a progressive accretion \nand infilling of the alveolar depressions. It was possibly at this time, around 6000 cal \nBP (the Neolithic), when the granite outcrops started to become exhumed together \nwith the upper part of the slabs. Studies on landscape evolution in NW Spain indicate \n\nFig. 8. Holocene changes in soil accumulation/erosion rates, vegetation change, charcoal content in \ncolluvial soils and soil reaction in Campo Lameiro, Pontevedra (Mart\u00ednez Cortizas et al. 2009a). \n\n\n\n6 4\n\nManuela Costa -Casais, Antonio Mart\u00ednez Cortizas, Joeri Kaal,  \nMaria Isabel Caetano Alves &amp; Felipe Criado -Boado\n\nthat soil erosion began to be a widespread phenomenon at least from 6000 -5500 cal \nBP. Most of these phases were also detected by synchronous erosion episodes in other \nareas of NW Spain (Benito et al. 1991; Mart\u00ednez Cortizas &amp; Moares Dom\u00ednguez 1995; \nMart\u00ednez Cortizas et al. 1999, 2000). \n\nThe role of climate changes in the formation of colluvial soils was also addressed by \nLeopold and V\u00f6lkel (2007), particularly related with extreme rainfall events. In Campo \nLameiro some of the erosion phases correlate with wet periods during the last 6000 years, \nbut there is not a direct relationship between the change in rainfall and the intensity of \nerosion. The erosive effect of rainfall may overlap with human -induced transformations. \nThe oldest erosion phases coincided with abrupt climate changes (Younger Dryas \u2013 \n>10000 cal BP or the 9000 -8000 cal BP period, including the 8.2 ka event; Mayewski \net al. 2004). These events occurred in periods of weak environmental repercussions of \nhuman activities. Other phases (Neoglaciation 5500 -5000 cal BP, the 4200 -3800 or 2750-\n-2450 cal BP event; Magny et al. 2006; van Geel et al. 2000; Lal et al. 2007), characterized \nby wetter and cooler conditions, occurred in periods of higher human impact, which \nprobably led to higher landscape sensitivity. The results suggest that since 6800 -6500 cal \nBP, human activities seem to have been coupled to climate changes and in that period \nbecame a relevant force that accelerated landscape evolution. The same chronology has \nbeen found in other areas of NW Spain (Mart\u00ednez Cortizas et al. 2009b). \n\nForest dynamics and fire use\nThe anthracological study of the macroscopic charcoal (>2 mm, obtained by wet \n\nsieving) in five colluvial soils from the Campo Lameiro area linked the fire history \nto vegetation change and slope processes (Fig. 8) (Kaal et al. 2011). Fires often cause \naccelerated soil erosion through elimination of the protective vegetation cover and \nlitter. The direct result is the exposure of the mineral soil to wind and water erosion. \nSoils located in the upper part of the slopes (i.e. geomorphologically active areas) can \nbe completely eroded. The black colour of the resulting colluvial soils seems to be, \nat least partially, associated with the abundance of vegetation fire residues (\u201cblack \ncarbon\u201d) not only as macroscopic charcoal fragments but also as fine -grained material \nincorporated into the soils\u2019 microgranular fabric (Kaal &amp; Van Mourik 2008). The \nformation of black -coloured soils rich in organic matter is often the consequence of \npyrogenic material accumulation from long -term fire regimes: chernozemic soils of \nthe lower Rhine basin (Gerlach et al. 2006), Australia (Skjemstad et al. 1996), and \nTerra Preta soils in South America (Glaser &amp; Amelung 2003). \n\nThe early phases of the Holocene in Campo Lameiro (10000 -7000 BP) were \ncharacterized by the expansion of forest vegetation, dominated by deciduous Quercus \n(Mart\u00ednez Cortizas et al. 2009b; Kaal et al. 2011) which remained dominant up until \nca. 6000 cal BP, when it started to be gradually replaced by shrub communities. Pollen \nstudies have found a sharp decrease in forest cover beginning by ca. 6500 cal BP. The \neffect of fire on the forest in this area is clear since ca. 6000 cal BP, and the charcoal \nrecord shows a decline in the contribution of oak and an increase in shrub species \n\n\n\n6 5\n\nReconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  \nan interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology\n\n(Erica sp.) that seems to be a good indicator of fire -induced environmental degradation \n(Fig. 8) (Kaal et al. 2011). The episodes of accelerated deforestation (ca. 5500 -5000 cal \nBP and ca. 2000 -1500 cal BP) coincided with periods of increased human pressure and \ncultural changes reflected in many areas of Europe (6000 BP Neolithic expansion of \nagriculture and pastoralism, 3000 BP Bronze Age/Iron Age transition and the 1700-\n-1500 BP Roman/Germanic shift; Tinner et al. 1999; Mighall et al. 2006) and climate \ndeterioration (especially the Neolithic that coincides with the Neoglaciation; Mart\u00ednez \nCortizas et al. 2009b).\n\nCharcoal layers identified in colluvial soils are often covered by high accumulation \nrates which confirm that fire was an important agent in the geomorphological \nevolution of Campo Lameiro landscape. Pedo -anthracological analyses by Kaal et \nal. (2011) showed that: i) the deforestation initiated on the upper part of the Monte \nParadela hill and probably had a local character; ii) the low degree of chronological \nprecision, which is inherent in fire history reconstructions from colluvial soils, made \nit impossible to distinguish climatic from human -induced fires, but the abundance of \nsynanthropic pollen indicators (e.g. Plantago lanceolata and Urtica dioica) since at \nleast ca. 6000 cal BP strongly suggests that humans used fire to generate and maintain \npasture; and iii) in NW Spain, macroscopic charcoal records in colluvial soils seem to \nprovide an excellent proxy for local fire -induced vegetation change.\n\nThese colluvial soils, traditionally referred to as Atlantic Rankers (Carballas et al. \n1967), should therefore be added to the list of black -coloured soils probably formed \nupon frequent anthropogenic fire starting in the Neolithic period (Mart\u00ednez Cortizas \net al. 2009a)\n\nSoil acidification\nAnother possible effect of human activities since prehistoric times was soil \n\nacidification. The results of the study of the Campo Lameiro colluvial soils reflected \nthat pH started to decrease ca. 6000 -5000 cal. BP (Fig. 8), an acidification trend that \nwould continue for several Millennia. It is only in the last 1000 years that pH seems to \nhave stabilized at its lowest values (Mart\u00ednez Cortizas et al. 2009a). \n\nThe beginning of acidification was synchronous with one of the most critical phases \nof forest decline, an increase in shrubs in the charcoal record, and an abrupt increase \nin total charcoal content in the colluvial soils. In soil layers generated during periods of \nhigh accumulation rates, pH values tend to be slightly higher than in layers formed in \nperiods of low accumulation rate. The substitution of the forest by a more acidophilous \nvegetation, the disruption of the biocycling of nutrients and increased leaching may \nhave been the processes leading this forced acidification of soils (Mart\u00ednez Cortizas et \nal. 2009a, 2012).\n\nA decline in forest cover and the first appearance of cereal pollen indicated \nby palynological studies (Ramil 1993; Mart\u00ednez Cortizas et al. 2005), the erosive \ndiscontinuities, stone and charcoal lines in colluvial soils, as well as the start of a \nprogressive soil acidification point to human activities as the main trigger.

CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nOur research suggests that both climate and human activities played an important \nrole in the formation of colluvial deposits of the study area. The geomorphological \nand sedimentological analyses indicate that the distribution of present landforms is a \nprimordial factor to understand the formation of the colluvial deposits. In agreement \nwith previous studies, this indicates that they are valuable geoarchives to reconstruct \nHolocene environmental change from a geoarchaeological approach. Given their \nwide distribution and the time expand covered by them, they may also be crucial \nto decipher and understand human responses to climate change and the impact of \nanthropogenic activities on the environment at the local and regional scales. The lack \nof archaeological remains for the studied area makes colluvial deposits an important \narchive that allows to trace the chronology of human activity. In this sense, we can \nbriefly summarize palaeoenvironmental information provided by these archives as \nfollows:\n\nClimatic changes dominated the environmental evolution until ca. 7000 years ago. \nAfter this date human modifications became an important driving force.\n\nIncreasing landscape instability phases since the mid -Holocene. Some of which \nwere coeval with known periods of Holocene abrupt climate change \u2013 the 8.2 ka event, \nthe beginning of the Neoglaciaton (ca. 5500 ka BP) or the 2.8 ka wet/cold events. But \nsome of the most intense phases are coincident with increased human pressure on \nlandscape during Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman Period and Middle Ages. \n\nFeatures such as charcoal layers, burnt soil layers and the highly aromatic nature of \nthe soil organic matter point to frequent fire episodes; pollen studies indicate a sharp \ndecrease in forest cover beginning by ca. 6500 cal. BP, that was accompanied by a \nprogressive soil acidification.\n\nTherefore, the geomorphological evolution is controlled by climatic and \nanthropogenic causes. The anthropogenic processes manifested as an acceleration of \nan existing pedogeomorphological process. Direct effects of the geomorphological \nchange in the landscape are: slope processes (erosion/sedimentation, i.e. landscape \ninstability), fire use accelerated soil erosion, modification of the vegetation cover and \nredistribution of soil resources and preferential concentration of soil in the alveoli \nmegaforms.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Manuela Costa -Casais is supported by a Research Program \u201cIsidro Parga \nPondal 2007\u201d \u2013 Xunta Galicia.
