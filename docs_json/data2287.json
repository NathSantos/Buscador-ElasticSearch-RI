Faced with the need to enlarge the existent battery of toxicity tools to assess and monitor water quality, particularly in rivers, the aim of the present study was to develop a short-term sublethal in situ assay based on the postexposure feeding of the freshwater snail T. fluviatilis. To achieve this purpose, a method to precisely quantify the feeding rate of T. fluviatlis was first developed under laboratory conditions, consisting of a 3-hours feeding period on 150 defrosted nauplii of A. franciscana in darkness. The sensitivity of the postexposure feeding response was then tested by comparing it with lethality after exposing the organisms to a range of cadmium concentrations. The 48-hours effective median cadmium concentration for postexposure feeding (EC50) was 179 pg/L and for lethality (LC50) was 208 pg/L, whereas the 96hours LC50 was 141 pg/L. Therefore, the lethal and sublethal responses showed a similar sensitivity to cadmium. Faced with this finding, the feeding inhibition and mortality were integrated into a recently proposed single population parameter -immediate inhibition of population consumption (popEC50) - since the feeding depression at the population level is caused by both the dead organisms and the feeding inhibition alive ones. The 48-hours popEC50 after exposure to cadmium was calculated through two methods which originated similar values, 157 and 150 pg/L, and revealed that at the 48-hours LC50 concentration (179 pg/L), the immediate inhibition of population consumption would be 79%, which corresponds to a high disruption of the snails ecosystem function. The influence of environmental conditions on the postexposure feeding response was evaluated by performing an in situ assay at five reference sites covering different exposure conditions regarding the variables\ntemperature, current velocity, hardness, conductivity, and sediment organic matter content and particle size distribution (percentages of gravel, sand and silt). Yet, temperature was not included in the model because the variation among sites was minimal and neither conductivity nor percentages of silt and gravel due to strong collinearity with other variables. The regression model showed no significant influence of either environmental condition on the postexposure feeding response, demonstrating the assay can be performed at sites with differences in all investigated environment conditions within the tested ranges. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed assay was evaluated by exposing organisms at three reference and five contaminated sites within the Mondego and Sado river basins. After a 48-hours in situ exposure, organisms at the single impacted site were mortality was not 100% (survival of 63%) presented a feeding inhibition relatively to the correspondent reference site (by 46%), showing that the postexposure feeding of T. fluviatilis is a potential valid response to detect contaminant effects. Therefore, the developed assay constitutes an important addition to the already existing battery of in situ assays used to assess and monitor rivers water quality, even though further studies should be performed mainly on its sensitivity to wider ranges of environmental variables and different types of contaminants.\nKeywords: Lotic systems, Cadmium, Postexposure feeding, In situ assay, Theodoxus fluviatilis\nRESUMO\nNas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas os n\u00edveis de polui\u00e7\u00e3o aumentaram consideravelmente nos sistemas aqu\u00e1ticos devido a atividades antropog\u00e9nicas, levando \u00e0 necessidade do desenvolvimento de ferramentas para avaliar e monitorizar o estado ecol\u00f3gico da \u00e1gua. Face \u00e0 necessidade de alargar o conjunto de ferramentas ecotoxicol\u00f3gicas j\u00e1 existentes para avaliar e monitorizar a qualidade da \u00e1gua, particularmente em rios, o objetivo deste trabalho foi desenvolver um ensaio in situ, subletal e de curta dura\u00e7\u00e3o, baseado na alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de um caracol de \u00e1gua doce, o T. fluviatilis. Para alcan\u00e7ar este objetivo foi desenvolvido, em condi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais, um m\u00e9todo para quantificar com precis\u00e3o a taxa de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de T. fluviatilis, que consiste em fornecer 150 nauplii descongelados de A. franciscana durante um per\u00edodo de 3 horas no escuro. A sensibilidade da resposta alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o foi depois testada atrav\u00e9s da sua compara\u00e7\u00e3o com a letalidade, ap\u00f3s expor os organismos a uma gama de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de c\u00e1dmio. A concentra\u00e7\u00e3o efetiva mediana de c\u00e1dmio \u00e0s 48 horas para a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o (EC50) foi de 179 pg/L e para a mortalidade (LC50) de 208 pg/L, e o valor de LC50 \u00e0s 96 horas foi de 141 pg/L. Assim sendo, a resposta letal e subletal mostraram ter uma sensibilidade semelhante ao c\u00e1dmio. Face a estes resultados, a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o da alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e a mortalidade foram integradas num \u00fanico par\u00e2metro, recentemente proposto - inibi\u00e7\u00e3o imediata do consumo da popula\u00e7\u00e3o (popEC50) - j\u00e1 que uma depress\u00e3o na alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel da popula\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 causada tanto pelos organismos que morreram como pela inibi\u00e7\u00e3o na alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos que permaneceram vivos. O popEC50 para as 48 horas de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao c\u00e1dmio foi calculado atrav\u00e9s de dois m\u00e9todos, que originaram valores semelhantes, 157 e 150 pg/L, e revelaram que para o LC50 \u00e0s 48 horas (179 pg/L) a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o imediata no consumo da popula\u00e7\u00e3o seria de 79%, o que corresponde a uma forte disrup\u00e7\u00e3o da fun\u00e7\u00e3o dos carac\u00f3is no\necossistema. A influ\u00eancia das condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais na resposta da alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o foi avaliada realizando um ensaio in situ em cinco locais de refer\u00eancia abrangendo diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente \u00e0s vari\u00e1veis temperatura, velocidade da corrente, dureza, condutividade, e conte\u00fado de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho de part\u00edculas do sedimento (percentagens de cascalho, areia e finos). N\u00e3o foram inclu\u00eddas no modelo a temperatura, porque a varia\u00e7\u00e3o entre os locais foi m\u00ednima, nem a condutividade e a percentagem de cascalho e finos devido a uma forte colinearidade com outras vari\u00e1veis. O modelo da regress\u00e3o n\u00e3o mostrou uma influ\u00eancia significativa das condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais na resposta da alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, demonstrando que o ensaio pode ser realizado em locais com diferen\u00e7as em todas estas vari\u00e1veis ambientais investigadas dentro dos intervalos testados. Finalmente, a efic\u00e1cia do ensaio in situ desenvolvido foi avaliada expondo os organismos em tr\u00eas locais de refer\u00eancia e cinco locais contaminados nas bacia dos rios Mondego e Sado. Ap\u00f3s 48 horas de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o in situ, os organismos do \u00fanico local contaminado onde a mortalidade n\u00e3o foi 100% (sobreviv\u00eancia de 6%) apresentaram uma inibi\u00e7\u00e3o na alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente ao local de refer\u00eancia da mesma bacia (de 46%), mostrando que a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o do T. fluviatilis \u00e9 uma resposta potencialmente v\u00e1lida para detetar efeitos de contaminantes. Assim sendo, o ensaio desenvolvido constitui uma importante adi\u00e7\u00e3o para o conjunto de ensaios in situ j\u00e1 existentes para avaliar e monitorizar a qualidade da \u00e1gua de rios, embora mais estudos devam ser realizados principalmente para investigar a sensibilidade do ensaio proposto a maior gama de valores das vari\u00e1veis ambientais e diferentes tipos de contaminantes.\nPalavras-chave: Sistemas l\u00f3ticos, C\u00e1dmio, Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, Ensaios in situ, Theodoxus fluviatilis\nChapter 1\nIntroduction\nNowadays, aquatic systems are frequently exposed to toxicants, mainly in the form of wastes, leading to a considerably increase in pollution and habitat degradation due to anthropogenic activity. Toxicants may enter into aquatic systems through diffusion, like agricultural runoff from land, urban runoff, dredged sediment disposal, contaminated ground water and bottom sediments, and atmosphere fallout, or through point sources, such as industrial effluents, hazardous waste disposal sites and wastewater treatment plants (Rand, 1995; Islam &amp; Tanaka, 2004; Rodriguez-Mozaz et al., 2004). After entering water bodies, toxicants can act as agents that produce adverse effects in the system, causing harm to living resources including human health, hindering aquatic activities, including fishing, impairing water quality (e.g. for drinking), reducing amenities, eventually damaging the structure and function of the ecosystems (Rand, 1995). Therefore, it is of major importance to evaluate the effects of contaminants in the environment, for which it is necessary to develop assessment and monitoring tools (Allan et al., 2006; Roman et al., 2007; Wharfe et al., 2007).\nAt present, the need to assess water quality is a component transversal to major pieces of environmental legislation across Europe, like the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (European Community, 2000). The WFD aims to improve, protect and prevent the further deterioration of water quality and to obtain and ensure the good ecological status of all water bodies until 2015 (Marin-Guirao et al., 2005; Allan et al., 2006; Wharfe et al., 2007). To achieve this propose, it is necessary to determine the environmental risks associated with water bodies and implement management plans for ecosystem rehabilitation and monitoring, which require the establishment and use of low-cost quality assessment tools to complement and provide a more holistic estimation of environmental quality evaluations (Allan et al., 2006; Roman et al., 2007).\nLaboratory ecotoxicity tests emerged into current quality evaluation strategies in many countries because they offer rapid measurements of environmental effects or of the potential environmental harm posed by contaminants (Rand, 1995; Chapman et al., 2002; Wharfe et al., 2007). The integration of toxicity tests into environmental quality assessments allows to evaluate the effects of chemicals on living organisms under laboratory controlled and reproducible conditions (Rand, 1995), which provides a causal linkage between contaminants and their biological effects, complementing chemical characterization and the monitoring of indigenous biota (Chapman, 1996; Burton et al., 2002). However, toxicity tests performed under laboratory controlled conditions have some limitations: (1) the collection and manipulation of samples may alter toxicity, (2) dynamic systems like estuaries and rivers are very difficult to simulate, (3) interactions among species are not taken into account, (4) fluctuating environmental conditions are not integrated, and (5) standard exposure media do not simulate contaminants adsorption kinetics (Adams, 2003; Chapman et al., 2003; Burton et al., 2005; Crane et al., 2007). It is also important to consider that in natural systems organisms are generally exposed not to a single chemical but rather to a myriad of substances which mixture is difficult to simulate in the laboratory (Rand, 1995). Therefore, most frequently, the observed effects in laboratory cannot be reliably extrapolated to real contamination scenarios (Connell et al., 1999; Burton et al., 2005; Liber et al., 2007).\nIn situ toxicity testing has been recognized as an useful approach in ecotoxicity assessments as it can be used, either alongside or instead, to transcend the disadvantages of laboratory tests (Crane et al., 2007). By exposing organisms in cages at the field sites, in situ assays incorporate field fluctuations, are less subjected to artifacts\nassociated with sample collection and manipulation and the exposure is under more realistic conditions, which result in a more ecologically relevant exposure scenario in a cost-effective way (DeWitt et al., 1999; Castro et al., 2004; Crane et al., 2007; Liber et al., 2007; Wharfe et al., 2007). However, it is important to be aware that in situ assays may also pose some limitations because there are many variables difficult to control, like the stress induced to the test organisms due to their transport to the field and caging (DeWitt et al., 1999), the exposure to the fluctuating environmental conditions that may complicate the establishment of a causal link between exposure and effects (Maltby et al., 2000; Adams, 2003), deployments in deep or fast-moving systems, the selection of appropriate reference sites, and even the vandalism of chambers during exposure (Burton et al., 2005).\nThe most commonly used test endpoint in aquatic toxicity testing is mortality (Rand, 1995). However, most often mortality does not provide enough information on contamination effects since chemicals are usually discharged at concentrations that induce ecologically relevant effects before killing the organisms (Gerhardt, 1996; Maltby et al., 2002; Mills et al., 2006; Pestana et al., 2007). Regarding sublethal endpoints, the most commonly used in toxicity assays are reproduction and growth (Pereira et al., 2000; Ringwood &amp; Keppler 2002; Castro et al., 2003). However, measurements of the latter sublethal responses imply long-term exposures and consequently huge efforts in time and money, especially when in situ assays are conducted. To circumvent these problems, the feeding response has recently been proposed as a sublethal response in toxicity tests, because an inhibition in feeding is known as a fast and sensitive response to a vast array of contaminants (Maltby, 1999; Maltby et al., 2002; McWilliam &amp; Baird, 2002; Castro et al., 2004).\nFeeding is a physiological function to organisms linked with growth, reproduction and survival and a depression in feeding rate, namely due to contaminants, may have direct effects on parameters at the individual level. These effects are successively transferred to higher levels of biological organization, which can compromise the success of populations and communities (Taylor et al., 1998). Moreover, a depression in feeding can also have direct and immediate effects on ecosystems, by hampering key functions (e.g. grazing, organic matter decomposition, secondary production), long before the effects at the individual level (e.g. reproduction, growth) have consequences at successively higher levels of biological organization (Forrow &amp; Maltby, 2000; Krell et al., 2011; Agostinho et al., 2012). Given that feeding rates during exposure, particularly in the field during in situ testing, are difficult to measure and it is known that the feeding response to contaminants usually persists in the period immediately after the exposure, the feeding rate can be quantified just after the exposure (before physiological recovery) - being the test endpoint designed as postexposure feeding - which allows tests to be methodologically simple (Taylor et al., 1998; McWilliam &amp; Baird, 2002; Moreira et al., 2005; Moreira et al., 2006a).\nWhen feeding depression occurs at partially lethal concentrations, the immediate inhibitory effect on the population consumption is due not only to a reduced population size, but also to a decrease on the feeding rate of the organisms that continue alive. Therefore, it is important to integrate survival and feeding into a single toxicity parameter - the immediate inhibition of population consumption - to improve ecological realism (Agostinho et al., 2012).\nIn ecotoxicological assays, the choice of the test species is an important aspect as it may highly influence the ecological relevance of the test results, both in field and in laboratory approaches (Baird et al., 2007). Yet, because it is impossible to acquire all the necessary understanding on the great majority of the species, it is necessary to focus on relevant species, i.e., if possible, on species that have a key role in the structure and function of the ecosystems, like keystone, sentinel or dominant species, and also the chosen species should be abundant (Baird et al., 2007; Amiard-Triquet, 2009).\nSnails are an integral component of freshwater lotic and lentic communities both as primary consumers (Ruehl &amp; Trexler, 2011) and as prey for invertebrate (leeches, flies and beetles) and vertebrate taxa (fish) (Brown &amp; DeVries, 1985; Lodge, 1986; Reed &amp; Janzen, 1999). Their grazing activity influences the dynamics of the macrophyte epiphyte system by reducing shading and competition for nutrients and through significant shifts in algal communities (Bronmark, 1989). Degradation of water quality may be an important factor affecting the declining populations of freshwater snails (Crichton et al., 2004; Besser et al., 2007). The reduction or elimination of a population of snails from the freshwater community may have significant consequences in the structure and function of communities (Lefcort et al., 2000; Ruehl &amp; Trexler,\n2011). Freshwater snails in lakes polluted with metals failed to exhibit antipredator behaviour (Lefcort et al., 2000). In the case of grazers, reduced feeding rate in organisms exposed to contaminants may have indirect effect on the algal community structure (Evans-White &amp; Lamberti, 2009).\nTheodoxus fluviatilis (L.) is a Prosobranchia Neritidae freshwater snail with a large distribution throughout Europe and Anatolia in lakes, streams, rivers, canals, and\neven estuaries and brackish waters, up to 60 m in depth (Zettler et al., 2004; Bunje, 2005; Kirkegaard, 2006; Bunje &amp; Lindberg, 2007). Its distribution is favoured by rapid currents, high content of calcium, carbon dioxide, dissolved oxygen, and high conductivity (Carlsson, 2000; Bunje, 2005; Kirkegaard, 2006; Gra\u00e7a et al., 2012), being absent in lakes with high contents of humic substances (Carlsson, 2000). Theodoxus fluviatilis is a scraper that feeds on biofilms, ingesting mainly diatoms, but also feeds on cyanobacteria and detritus (Zettler et al., 2004; Kirkegaard, 2006). In rivers, T. fluviatilis is mainly fixed to the substrate, preferably stones where they scrap food, in shallow areas and is less present in vegetation (Zettler et al., 2004; Gra\u00e7a et al., 2012). The densities of the populations of the T. fluviatilis are variable. According to Gra\u00e7a et al. (2012), the density of T. fluviatilis in the spring source of An\u00e7os river (Portugal) can vary from approximately 10 to 9 000 individuals per square meter, but decreases to zero 3 800 m downstream. In the littoral zone of Lake Esrom (Denmark), a local population showed a variable density, between 556 and 2 100 individuals per square meter, with a mean annual abundance of 1 084 individuals per square meter (Kirkegaard, 2006).\n1.1\t- Objectives\nThe aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a short-term sublethal toxicity in situ assay based on the postexposure feeding of the freshwater snail T. fluviatilis to complement river quality assessments and monitoring. To achieve this purpose, four specific objectives were delineated: (1) to develop a method to easily, precisely and rapidly quantify the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis in the laboratory, while preventing organisms\u2019 physiological recovery, (2) to investigate the sensitivity of the postexposure feeding response relatively to survival, after exposure to the model\ntoxicant cadmium, (3) to determine the influence of environmental factors on the postexposure feeding response, to infer upon the need to discriminate potential environmental from contaminant effects, and (4) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed in situ assay by deploying it at several reference and allegedly impacted sites within the Mondego and Sado River basins.\nChapter 2\nMaterials and Methods\n2.1\t- Assay organisms\nOrganisms of T. fluviatilis were collected at the spring source of the An\u00e7os River (Central Portugal: 39\u00b058'43.40''N, 8\u00b034'23.30''W), with a mean (\u00b1 standard error) annual water temperature of 16.1\u00b0C (\u00b10.1) (Gra\u00e7a et al., 2012). This site was previously classified as \u201cminimally disturbed\u201d based on (i) classes of water quality for multiple uses by the National Water Agency (INAG, Portugal), (ii) species composition and abundance in the riparian corridor, (iii) channel morphology, and (iv) urbanization and industrial activities in the catchment area (Feio et al., 2010), and presently considered as being in a good ecological status for support of aquatic life according to the physicochemical parameters listed under the national implementation of the Water Framework Directive (M.J. Feio, personal communication).\nOrganisms were handpicked from stream-bed stones and transported in thermally insulated boxes filled with local water to the laboratory or directly to the in situ assays sites. For the laboratory experiments (feeding quantification and endpoint sensitivity), organisms were conditioned for transportation (30 minutes trip) in plastic containers (length x width x height of 21 x 15.4 x 9.4 cm). In the laboratory, cultures were maintained in a temperature controlled room at 19 to 21\u00b0C under a 14:10-hours light:dark cycle, in plastic containers with aerated culture medium (approximately 5-cm height) and local stones, as T. fluviatilis is a scraper feeding on biofilm (Zettler et al., 2004; Kirkegaard, 2006). Culture medium consisted initially of 100% local water and within the first week was gradually changed to 100% reconstituted hard water (ASTM, 2002), hereafter referred to as ASTM medium; medium was renewed three times a week and plastic containers were renewed once a week. Each collected batch of organisms was maintained under these controlled laboratory conditions during a maximum period\nof two weeks. For the in situ assays, organisms were collected at the same day as deployment and conditioned to be transported to the study sites in 50-ml polypropylene vials (10 organisms/vial; see section 2.2) filled with local water.\nThe size of each experimental batch of organisms was estimated at the end of each experiment/assay through measurements of the shell height and length in a sample of 20 organisms, according to the scheme presented in Figure 1 (Zettler et al., 2004).\nFigure 1 - Scheme of the shell dimensions used to measure the length and height of the shell of Theodoxus fluviatilis (adapted from Zettler et al., 2004).\n2.2\t- In situ assay chambers and procedures\nThe assay chambers used were those previously developed by Moreira et al. (2005). Each assay chamber (Figure 2) consisted of a 20-cm long and 5 cm inner diameter acrylic tube with open ends with 0.5 cm wall thickness, being the bottom edge slimmed for 1 cm to facilitate penetration into the sediment. The exchange of overlying water (at the water-column level) and porewater (at the sediment level) between the interior and exterior of the chamber was guaranteed by two opposite rectangular windows (4 x 10 cm) covered with a 200-pm nylon mesh. To cover the top end of the\nassay chamber during exposure, a nylon mesh (15 x 15 cm), held by an elastic band, was used.\nFigure 2 - Schematic view of assay chamber for the 48-hours in situ assay with Theodoxus fluviatilis; (1) 200-pm nylon mesh cover (15 x 15 cm) (2) 1-cm wide elastic band, (3) transparent plastic tube (2-m long and 4-mm inner diameter), (4) 200-pm mesh lateral widow (4 x 10 cm) (adapted from Moreira et al., 2005).\nTo deploy chambers, they were carefully pushed into the sediment to a depth of about 10 cm, so that the lateral windows allowed both the flow of the overlying water at the water-column level and of porewater at the sediment level. When needed, a holding structure made from a 10 x 21 x 25-cm basket of plastic coated metal wire was used to protect assay chambers from strong water flows (Soares et al., 2005). Three replicate chambers were deployed at each site and 10 organisms were deployed per chamber. Although only 8 organisms were required to quantify postexposure feeding rates, the\ndeployment of 10 organisms per chamber, while respecting field densities (Kirkegaard, 2006; Gra\u00e7a et al., 2012) facilitated organism retrieval at the end of the assay. After organisms\u2019 deployment chambers were covered with the 200-pm nylon mesh.\nAfter the 48 hours exposure period, chambers were retrieved from the sediment and individually placed into trays to retrieve the organisms from the sediment. Organisms from each replicate were placed into the same 50-ml polypropylene used for transportation to the field sites filled with local water to prevent organisms\u2019 physiological recovery, and transported to the laboratory inside thermally insulated boxes at approximately 20\u00b0 C. A 5-hours period since the retrieval of the chambers until the beginning of the postexposure feeding quantification was established to provide similar conditions among sites. After this period, individuals were allowed to feed according to the procedures described below (section 2.4).\nAt each site, conductivity (Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkstatten Cond315i/SET conductivity meter, WTW, Weilheim, Germany), dissolved oxygen (WTW OXI 92 oxygen meter) and current velocity (Valeport 108 MklII current meter; Devin, United Kingdom) were measured at deployment (sections 2.6 and 2.7) and the former two parameters also at retrieval at the allegedly contaminated sites (section 2.7). Values of pH (WTW 537 pH meter) and hardness (only for in situ assay at reference sites; section 2.6) were measured in samples collected at the study sites immediately upon arrival to the laboratory and kept frozen until analysis, respectively, Temperature (Cond315i/SET) was measured at the beginning and end of all deployments.\nAt the end of all deployments, composite sediment samples were collected into black airtight plastic bags, transported to the laboratory and stored at 4\u00b0C until processed for sediment characterization, i.e., humidity, organic matter content and particle size distribution. Water content was determined by measuring the loss of\nsediment weight after oven drying at 60\u00b0C for three days and was expressed as the mean percentage of the initial wet weight of three sediment subreplicates. Organic matter content (percent volatile solids) was determined by quantifying the loss of weight after ignition in a muffle furnace (Nabatherm L3, Lilienthal, Germany) at 600\u00b0C for 6 hours and was expressed as the mean percentage of the oven-dry weight of the sediment (Buchanan &amp; Kain, 1971). The sediment particle size distribution was analyzed by sieving the sediment (pooling of three subreplicates) into eleven fractions, ranging from 63 gm to 64 mm. The sediment remaining on each sieve was weighted, expressed as a percentage of the final weight and classified according to the Wentworth scale (Buchanan &amp; Kain, 1971).\n2.3\t- Study sites\nTo evaluate the effect of the environmental conditions on the 48-hours postexposure feeding of T. fluviatilis (section 2.6) and the effectiveness of the proposed in situ assay (section 2.7), five reference sites (R1 to R5) were selected within the Mondego River basin (Central Portugal) and one reference (R6) and five sites allegedly impacted by a mine effluent, characterized by very low pH and high metal concentrations (I1 to I5), were selected within the Sado River basin (South Portugal).\nThe Mondego hydrological basin is located entirely in Portuguese territory, having about 6 670 km2 (Marques et al., 2002). All reference sites within this river basin were selected based on their classification as \u201creference sites\u201d, identified through predictive models for water quality assessments in compliance with the WFD using macroinvertebrate communities as biological indicators and various environmental explanatory variables (Feio et al., 2007). The five reference sites were the following:\nspring of the An\u00e7os River (R1: 39\u00b058'43.40''N, 8\u00b034'23.30''W), An\u00e7os River (R2:\n39\u00b059'53.45''N, 8\u00b035'02.15''W), Arunca River (R3: 39\u00b052'53.00''N, 8\u00b037'12.65''W),\nCrespos Stream (R4: 39\u00b054'28.45''N, 8\u00b042'18.00''W) and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Stream (R5: 40\u00b005'58.50''N, 8\u00b014'02.60''W) (Figure 3).\n\nRetorta\nPmhete\nP\u00f3rtete do Sesmo\n\u27135aml presalves\n~S (\u00d12]\n\u2022 Lous\u00e3\nIsJ l\u00e3)\nAJagoa\n[N236-1]\n'\u2022 Pombal\nl\u00e3)\n|N237|\niNI-dl\n\u00cd\u00d1M21\n|N348|\n[\u00d1M21\n|N23B|\n\u00cd\u00d12361\ncS Condeixa-a-Nova\nLugar dos Netos\n\u00cd\u00d1M21\nI\u00d1237]\n\u00cd\u00d1M7]\n[\u00d13S8]\n[\u00d1S7]\n\u00cd\u00d1M21\nF\u00f5\u00e3Tl\n[NIIOl\n(\u00d1?57]\n\u00cd\u00d1237]\n|N35O|\nESS Baianos\nCimeiras\n\u00ae \u00ed\u00fc\u00fc\u00ea]\n*R3\n______ Coentrai l\u00e3\u00bb) BoFo,\u00bb\nSoure\nCD\n[>0371\nSem\u00e2oAlto\nA- ' \u00e7a\nCasttnheea de P\u00e9ra Gest\u00f3se Ir\u00f4\u00f5TI F\u201c\"\u00b0\u201d\nLouren\u00e7os Xtontais\nCese' P\ndo Justo\t9KZ\nFigure 3 - Study sites selected as reference sites (R1 to R5) within the Mondego River basin (Central Portugal) for the in situ assay to evaluate the influence of environmental conditions on the 48-hours postexposure feeding of Theodoxus fluviatilis (from Google maps.

The Aljustrel cupriferous pyrite mine is located within the area of this basin (Lopes etal., 2000). It is one of the greatest mines within the Iberian Pyrite Belt, a world class volcanic-hosted massive sulphids metalogenetic province (Luis et al., 2009; Alvarenga et al., 2008). The mine effluent, with its origin on the mine tailings, runs through the small Agua Forte Stream which drains into the Roxo River, an effluent of the Sado River. Low pH values and high\nmetal concentrations are present in the stream, mainly (concentrations, in mg/L, previously detected in the \u00c1gua Forte Stream; Lopes et al., 2000) Fe (1095), Al (695), Zn (695), Cu (160), Mn (123), Co (3.6), Cd (1.51), and Ni (1.47); yellow precipitates of FeOH3 (commonly referred to as \u201cyellow-boy\u201d) contribute to a high water acidity (Harris et al., 2003). The reference site was selected in the Roxo River upstream the Aljustrel mine contaminated area (R6; 37\u00b056'29.60''N, 8\u00b008'04.30''W), whereas the five impacted sites were located along the dilution gradient of the mine effluent in the \u00c1gua Forte Stream (I1: 37\u00b056'31.10''N, 8\u00b008'53.35''W; I2: 37\u00b056'39.05''N, 8\u00b009'01.05''W; I3: 37\u00b056'41.00''N, 8\u00b009'01.90''W); I4: 37\u00b056'42.70''N, 8\u00b009'01.85''W; I5: 37\u00b056'43.20''N, 8\u00b009'02.06''W) (Figure 4).\nFigure 4 - Study sites selected as reference (R6) and allegedly impacted (I1 to I5) within the Sado River basin (South Portugal) for the 48-hours postexposure feeding in situ assay with Theodoxus fluviatilis to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed assay chambers and procedures (from Google maps. (Consult. 27 jul. 2012) URL: http://maps.google.com/7lU37.91872,-8.14477&amp;z=12&amp;t=h).\n2.4\t- Feeding quantification\nTo develop a methodology to precisely quantify the postexposure feeding rates of T. fluviatilis in the shortest possible period, aiming at minimizing organisms\u2019 physiological recovery, preliminary and definitive experiments were conducted with organisms deprived of food during the previous 24 hours. Two food types were preliminary tested: dried spinach mats and defrosted nauplii (less than 24-hours old) of Artemia franciscana. The dried spinach mats were prepared based on the procedures described by Crichton et al. (2004). In brief, frozen spinach (Iglo, Porto Salvo, Portugal) was macerated with a hand-blender using ASTM medium (1g/1 ml) for 2 minutes, 5 ml of this mixture were used to fill the bottom of 8-cm diameter plastic Petri dishes, which were left to dry at 60\u00b0C overnight. To quantify feeding rates on dried spinach mats, egestion was used as a surrogate of feeding following the methodology proposed by Krell et al., (2011), i.e., a three-stage procedure (at 20\u00b0C in darkness): (1) a first stage for organisms to clean their guts from the food ingested during exposure (5 organisms/5-cm diameter plastic Petri dish filled with 12 ml ASTM medium for 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes), (2) a second stage to allow organisms to feed on spinach (5 organisms/8-cm diameter plastic Petri dish filled with 25 ml ASTM medium for 1 hour), and (3) a final third stage to quantify egestion rates (5 organisms/5-cm diameter plastic Petri dish filled with 12 ml ASTM medium for 60, 90 and 120 minutes). The observed results showed a minimal consumption on spinach, a high variability in faecal pellets produced and difficulty in quantifying individual faecal pellets.\nNauplii of A. franciscana were obtained by incubating cysts (Creasel, Deinze, Belgium) in standard reconstituted seawater (salinity and pH of 35 and around 7.6, respectively) at 24 to 26\u00b0C under continuous light (75 pE/m2/s) during 24 hours (Soares\net al., 2005). They were then counted under a stereomicroscope into 1.5 ml eppendorfs with ASTM medium and stored at -20\u00b0C up to a maximum period of two months. Preliminary experiments were conducted with different combinations of the following variables: vial shape and volume of ASTM medium (30-ml glass vials with a 2.2 cm diameter filled with 5 ml medium and 24-well microplates with 1 ml medium per well), organism density (1, 3 and 5), food quantity (100 and 150 nauplii), and feeding periods (1 up to 3 hours). Results showed nauplii to be actively consumed by T. fluviatilis relatively to spinach and thus a suitable food to quantify feeding rates.\nBased on these preliminary results and to optimize the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis on A. franciscana nauplii, an experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of food quantity (100 versus 150 naupii). For each treatment, 20 replicates were set up in 24-well microplates with each replicate consisting of 1 organism/well filled with 1 ml ASTM medium. Organisms were allowed to feed for 3 hours in darkness. Organisms used in this experiment had a mean (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD]; n = 20) shell height and length of 4.39 (\u00b10.24) and 5.56 (\u00b10.25) mm, respectively. Results obtained (see Results section) determined the following methodology to determine the feeding rates of T. fluviatilis: snails placed individually in 1 well of 24-well microplates containing 1 ml of ASTM medium and 150 defrosted nauplii of A. franciscana and allowed to feed in darkness for a period of 3 hours, to estimate feeding rates as number of consumed nauplii/organism/3 hours.\nA second experiment was conducted to evaluate whether the time lag between organism collection and feeding quantification, i.e., laboratory culture age (1 up to 7 days) influences T. fluviatilis feeding rate. In parallel, the influence of organism size was also investigated. During seven days in a row, starting the day after organism collection, 20 replicate organisms with an overall mean (\u00b1 SD) shell height and length\nof 4.02 (\u00b10.22) and 5.05 (\u00b10.22) mm were collected from cultures and allowed to feed under the conditions above stated. At days 3 and 4, 20 organism of a different size class, i.e., with an overall mean (\u00b1 SD) shell height and length of 4.86 (\u00b10.22) and 6.12 (\u00b10.33) mm were also used to quantify feeding rates as consumed nauplii/organism/3 hours.\n2.5\t- Endpoint sensitivity\nThe sensitivity of the postexposure feeding response of T. fluviatilis was evaluated by exposing organisms to lethal and sublethal concentrations of cadmium to compare the 48-hours median effect concentration (EC50) for postexposure feeding with the 48- and 96-hours median lethal concentration (LC50). An exposure period of 48 hours for the postexposure feeding test was chosen because feeding is expected to be a fast response to contaminants that persists in the period immediately after exposure (McWilliam &amp; Baird, 2002; Moreira et al., 2005; Pestana et al., 2007; Krell et al., 2011; Agostinho et al., 2012).\nA stock solution of cadmium (5 g/L) prepared in nanopure water with cadmium chloride monohydrate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to prepare the test solutions by adding the appropriate volumes to ASTM medium. For the 96-hours lethality test, a control (ASTM medium) and seven nominal cadmium concentrations were used using a dilution factor of 1.5 (750, 500, 333, 222, 148, 98.8, and 65.8 gg/L). To estimate the 48-hours LC50 and EC50 for postexposure feeding (using the same test and checking for dead organisms after quantifying postexposure feeding, see below), a control and the same seven nominal cadmium concentrations of the 96-hours lethal test were used. The mean (\u00b1SD; n = 20) shell height and length of the organisms used in the\n96-hours lethal test was 4.25 (\u00b10.21) and 5.37 (\u00b10.21) mm, whereas the correspondent means of those used in the 48-hours test was 4.32 (\u00b10.23) and 5.38 (\u00b10.24) mm.\nFor both tests, five replicates were set up per test concentration. Each replicate consisted of 5 organisms in a 60-ml glass vial filled with test solution, covered with a 200-pm nylon mesh, held in place with an elastic band, and placed inside polyethylene terephthalate containers (5-cm diameter) filled with the test solution, so that the vials were submerged (to guarantee continuous organism exposure). No food was added during the tests. Both tests were conducted at 19 to 21\u00b0C under a 14:10-hour light:dark photoperiod. In the 96-hours test, solutions were renewed once after 48 hours to ensure that cadmium concentrations were maintained. After the 96-hours exposure, mortality was assessed by observing organisms under a stereomicroscope. For the organisms not showing movements, mortality was verified by touching the organisms with a needle and snails that did not react to the touch were counted as dead. In the 48-hours test, postexposure feeding was quantified immediately at the end of exposure following the procedures described above, and only after, not to induce stress to organisms, mortality was assessed. Conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH were measured in two replicates of all fresh and old test solutions.\n2.6\t- Influence of environmental exposure conditions on postexposure feeding\nThe influence of environmental conditions on the background variability of the 48-hours postexposure feeding of T. fluviatilis was investigated in situ, following the procedures described in section 2.2. For this, an in situ assay was performed at five reference sites (R1 to R5) within the Mondego River basin (central Portugal; please see\nsection 2.3). These five sites were selected to cover different environmental exposure conditions regarding the variables temperature, current velocity, hardness, conductivity, and sediment organic matter content and particle size distribution, even though pH and dissolved oxygen were also measured (for further details see section 2.2). Besides, to maximise the number of different combinations involving sediment particle size and current velocity, four and two treatments were deployed at sites R1 and R5, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD; n = 20) shell height and length of the organisms used in this assay was 4.23 (\u00b10.13) and 5.28 (\u00b10.14) mm.\n2.7\t- In situ assay effectiveness\nThe effectiveness of the proposed assay chambers and methodologies for toxicity evaluation based on the 48-hours postexposure feeding of T. fluviatilis was evaluated by performing an in situ assay at three reference (R1, R2 and R6) and five sites allegedly impacted by an acid mine drainage (for details on selected sites see section 2.3), following the procedures described in section 2.2. Whereas site R6 was selected as a reference within the same river basin as the impacted sites, sites R1 and R2 were selected as references within the same river basin where organisms were collected and the influence of environmental conditions on the background variability in postexposure feeding was evaluated. The mean (\u00b1SD; n = 20) shell height and length of the organisms used in this in situ assay was 4.40 (\u00b10.15) and 5.44 (\u00b10.14) mm.\n2.8\t- Data analysis\nFor the first experiment on the influence of food quantity (100 versus 150 naupii) on the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis, means were compared through the Student's t-test and differences between the coefficients of variation (CV) of the two means were tested through the Miller equation (Zar, 1996). In the second experiment, the effect of laboratory culture age (up to 7 days) on the feeding rate of the smallest organism size class was assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). As for the effect of organism size on feeding rate, it was evaluated by a Student's t-test comparing feeding rates of the pooled organisms (n = 40) of the two size classes. This effect was further evaluated with Pearson's correlation. Prior to these analyses (second experiment), a one-way ANOVA confirmed that all sets of 20 organisms used during the 7-days experiment had a similar shell height and length (F6,133 > 0.92; P > 0.30), whereas Student's t-tests confirmed the feeding rates of the two groups of twenty organisms within each size class (two days feeding trial) to be similar (t37-38 &lt;0.26; P > 0.18) and the shell height and length between (the pooled 40) organisms of the two size classes to be significantly different (t78 &lt;15; P &lt;0.001). Prior to all analysis of variance, the assumptions of normality (Shapiro-Wilk's test) and homoscedasticity (Bartlett's test) were checked.\nThe 48- and 96-hours lethal concentrations (LC20 and LC50) for cadmium and the corresponding 95% confidence limits (CL) were calculated using the software PriProbit 1.63 (Sakuma, 1998) (http://bru.gmprc.ksu.edu/proj/priprobit/download.asp), which applies the probit transformation on the proportion of mortality and the logarithmic transformation on the concentration values. The 48-hours cadmium effective concentrations for postexposure feeding (EC20 and EC50) and the\ncorrespondent 95% CL were estimated by fitting the feeding response to a logistic model (EC, 2004).\nTo integrate the effect of cadmium due to lethality and feeding inhibition into a single parameter (immediate inhibition of population consumption) two methods were used (Krell et al., 2011; Agostinho et al., 2012). The first method consisted of recalculating the 48-hours EC50 and EC20 by multiplying individual feeding rates by the respective proportional survival at each cadmium concentration. In the second method the concentration-response relationships relatively to feeding and to survival were integrated as x% of the population consumption inhibition induced by the cadmium concentration that simultaneously caused (i) a y% mortality (i.e., the LCy) and (ii) a w% depression on individual feeding (i.e., the ECw) (therefore LCy = ECw); x (in %) being quantified as:\nx = [1 - (1 - y/100) x (1 - w/100)] x 100\nTo quantify the influence of abiotic parameters on the feeding rate, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed, using the software R 2.6.0 (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and Brodgar 2.5.7 (Highland Statistics, Newburgh, UK). Explanatory variables included in the model were current velocity, hardness, organic matter content, and percentage of sand (particle size between 0.063 and 2.0 mm). Temperature and pH were not included in the model because their variation among sites was minimal. Conductivity and percentages of silt and gravel were excluded due to strong collinearity, being correlated with hardness, organic matter content and percentage of sand, respectively (r = 0.89, r = 0.99 and r = 1.00).\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed in situ assay, the postexposure feeding rate between the impacted site I5 (since survival was 0% at the remaining four impacted sites) and the reference site R6 within the same river basin (Sado) was\ncompared by one-way nested ANOVA. Prior to this analysis, postexposure feeding rates of the organisms from the three reference sites were tested by a one-way nested ANOVA to confirm that there were no differences between all reference sites.\nExcept otherwise stated, all analyses were performed using the software\nStatistica 8.0 (StatSoft, Aurora, CO, USA) and the level of significance was set at 0.05.\nChapter 3\nResults\n3.1\t- Feeding quantification\nWhen testing the influence of food quantity on the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis, significant more defrosted nauplii of A. franciscana were eaten when 150 rather than 100 items were given to each organism, with feeding rates of 13 and 22 nauplii/organism/3 hours, respectively (Student's t-test: t35 = 2.96; P &lt;0.01). However, no significant differences were found between the CV values of the two means (49 and 46%, respectively; Z = 0.216; P > 0.05). Thus, to maximize the power of discrimination among treatments, 150 nauplii were used in all subsequent experiments/assays.\nThe laboratory culture age (up to 7 days) had no significant effect on the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis (one-way ANOVA: F6,127 = 1.64; P = 0.14); overall means ranged from 20.8 to 29.4 nauplii/organism/3 hours with CV values between 30 and 49%. Moreover, feeding rates were not significantly influenced by organism size within the two size classes considered (mean shell height and length of 4.02 and 5.05 mm and of 4.86 and 6.12 mm, respectively), as shown by Student's t-test comparing feeding rates (t78 = 0.40; P > 0.88) and Pearson\u2019s correlation between feeding rate and shell size (height: r = 0.092; P = 0.22; length: r = 0.11; P = 0.14).\n3.2\t- Endpoint sensitivity\nOverall, dissolved oxygen was always above 40% and pH and conductivity ranged within short optimal intervals, 7.23 to 7.87 and 547 to 595 gS/cm, respectively. In both the 48-hours postexposure feeding and 96-hours lethal tests for cadmium no control mortality was observed. In the 48-hours test, mortality was observed as of the 222 gg/L concentration and 100% mortality was observed in the two highest\nconcentrations (500 and 750 gg/L). The 48- and 96-h LC50 values (95% CL) of cadmium were 208 (186 - 230) and 141 (122 - 162) gg/L, respectively, whereas the correspondent LC20 values (95% CL) were 162 (136 - 180) and 91.6 (72.5 - 108) gg/L. The 48-hours EC50 and EC20 values (95% CL) for postexposure feeding were 179 (137 - 222) and 96.1 (54.7 - 137) gg/L, respectively.\nUsing the first and the second integration techniques, the 48-hours median immediate inhibition population consumption (popEC50) estimates for cadmium were 157 (95% CL: 134 - 181) and 150 gg/L, respectively; the latter resulting from a 15% mortality and a 41% individual feeding depression. At the median individual effective concentration (48-hours EC50 = 179 pg /L), the mortality would be 31% and the population-level feeding depression would be 66%. At the median lethal concentration (48-hours LC50 = 206 gg /L), the individual feeding depression would be 58% and the population feeding depression would be 79%.\n3.3\t- Influence of environmental exposure conditions on postexposure feeding\nResults of the physico-chemical parameters measured in the water column during the in situ assay and of the sediment characteristics at each site are presented in Tables I and II, respectively. The required numbers of 8 organisms for postexposure feeding quantifications were rapidly retrieved from the chambers and no mortalities were recorded. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that neither current velocity, nor hardness, nor sediment organic matter content, nor percentage of sand significantly influenced the 48-hours postexposure feeding rate of T. fluviatilis (P > 0.15).\nTable I - Physico-chemical parameters measured in the water column at each of the five reference sites (R1 to R5) within the Mondego River basin (Central Portugal) to evaluate the influence of environmental exposure conditions on the 48-hours postexposure feeding of Theodoxus fluviatilis.

Overall, temperature ranged between 17 and 25\u00b0C with small variations within each site (&lt;3\u00b0C ) and a marked gradient in conductivity (1255 - 4260 pS/cm) and pH (2.12 - 7.24) was observed along the allegedly impacted sites (from I1 to I5) (Table III).\nThe required numbers of 8 organisms for postexposure feeding quantifications were rapidly retrieved from the chambers and mortality was observed at all impacted sites, 100% at I1, I2, I3, and I4, and 37% at I5. The 48-hours postexposure feeding rates of T. fluviatilis were similar across all three reference sites (one-way nested ANOVA: F2,56 = 2.02; P > 0.21), confirming the use of R6 as a reference site (Figure 5). The postexposure feeding rate of organisms at the impacted site I5 was significantly inhibited (by 46%) relatively to the reference site R6 (one-way nested ANOVA: F1,24 = 22.7; P &lt;0.001), with mean (\u00b1SD) postexposure feeding rates of 20.7 (\u00b112) and 44.9 (\u00b114) nauplii/organism/3 hours, respectively (Figure 6).

To achieve this purpose four steps needed to be sequentially tackled. Firstly, a method to precisely quantify the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis before organisms\u2019 recovery was established under laboratory conditions. Secondly, to infer upon the sensitivity of the postexposure feeding response, the later response was compared with lethality by exposing organisms to the reference toxicant cadmium. Thirdly, the influence of environmental variables on the background variability of the postexposure feeding response was evaluated to be able to discriminate toxic effects from those associated to differences in environmental factors across sites. Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed in situ assay was evaluated by deploying it at several reference and allegedly impacted sites within the Mondego and Sado River basins.\n4.1\t- Feeding quantification\nThe methodology adopted in the present study to quantify feeding rates of T. fluviatilis was based on previously developed approaches to quantify feeding rates in the period immediately after exposure - postexposure feeding as the assay endpoint (e.g. Soares et al., 2005; Moreira et al., 2006a). Ideally, feeding rates should be measured during the exposure period to minimize an eventual physiological recovery of the organisms in the period after exposure. However, because it is difficult to quantify feeds and thus feeding rates during exposure, particularly during in situ testing, the use of postexposure feeding responses has been widely acknowledged as a valid approach since toxic effects generally persist in the period immediately after toxicant exposure,\nbefore physiological recovery (McWilliam &amp; Baird, 2002; Crichton et al., 2004; Moreira et al., 2005). Postexposure feeding has already been successfully used with freshwater and estuarine organisms including cladocerans (McWilliam &amp; Baird, 2002), amphipods (Agostinho et al., 2012), snails (Crichton et al., 2004), mudnails (Krell et al., 2011), midges (Soares et al., 2005), crabs (Moreira et al., 2006a), polychaetes (Moreira et al., 2005, 2006b), prawns (Satapornvanit et al., 2009), and small fish (Castro et al., 2004). Also in accordance with various in situ assays previously developed (McWilliam &amp; Baird, 2002; Moreira et al., 2005; Soares et al., 2005; Moreira et al., 2006a,b; Krell et al., 2011), the quantification of the postexposure response was performed under dark conditions. Quantifying feeding in darkness, rather than under a light regime, allows estimations to be performed in shorter periods (Krell et al., 2011) as well as the establishment of more precise feeding rates (Moreira et al., 2005; Soares et al., 2005).\nUp to present, to our knowledge, toxicity tests based on the feeding response of snails proposed as test endpoint the use of egestion rate as a surrogate to quantify feeding rates, either on spinach mats (freshwater snail Lymnaeaperegra; Crichton et al., 2004) or on sediment (mudsnail Hydrobia ulvae; Shipp &amp; Grant, 2006; Krell et al., 2011). In the present study, preliminary attempts to quantify feeding rates of T. fluviatilis indirectly through egestion rates after a feeding period on spinach mats were first carried out. However, the spinach consumption of T. fluviatilis was minimal, individual faecal pellets were difficult to quantify and a high variability in faecal pellets production was found. Yet, surprisingly for a scrapper, preliminary attempts also revealed that defrosted nauplii of A. fransciscana was a suitable food item to directly quantify postexposure feeding rates of T. fluviatilis, as they were a readily consumed food item. Using nauplii greatly simplified the feeding quantification procedures\nturning them faster and shorter, and yielded more precise results. This finding is in agreement with previous studies using nauplii to successfully quantify feeding rates of midges (Soares et al., 2005), polychaetes (Moreira etal., 2006b; Rosen &amp; Miller, 2011), prawns (Satapornvanit et al., 2009), and amphipods (Agostinho et al., 2012). Thus, for aquatic snails, the quantification of feeding rates on nauplii is a novel suitable approach to be used as an assay endpoint.\nThe methodology for assay endpoint estimation proposed in the present study requires a postexposure feeding period of 3 hours, a compromise between the estimation of precise feeding rates and an eventual physiological recovery of the organisms from the effects of the toxicants. Indeed, shorter postexposure feeding periods have preferably been established (e.g., 30 min for an amphipod; Agostinho et al., 2011, 1 hour for a midge; Soares et al., 2005), given that it is essential to minimize the eventual physiological recovery of the organisms from the effects during exposure (Brent &amp; Herricks, 1998; McWilliam &amp; Baird, 2002). Physiological recovery from toxicant effects has been reported for the cladoceran Daphnia magna approximately 4 hours after exposure to sublethal concentrations of copper, fluoranthene (McWilliam &amp; Baird; 2002) and phenol (Brent &amp; Herricks, 1998). However, Brent and Herricks (1988) did not found the amphipod Hyalella azteca to recover its mobility 7 days after a 10-days exposure to cadmium and zinc.\nWhen testing the influence of food quantity on the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis, results from the present study showed organisms to eat significantly more when 150 rather than 100 nauplii were provided, even though no differences were found between the coefficients of variation of the two means. As expected, the probability of a snail to find a nauplii increases with an increase in food concentration, as it has been previously observed for the midge Chironomus riparius (Soares et al., 2005). Thus, 150 nauplii\nwere used in all subsequent experiments/assays because a higher consumption allows better discriminating differences in feeding rates across treatments.\nIn the experiment here performed to evaluate the influence of the time lag between field collection and feeding quantification, i.e., laboratory culture age (1 up to 7 days), on the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis, no differences in the consumption of nauplii were detected among the recently field collected snails (1-day old culture) and the ones kept in the laboratory up to one week. This is a very important finding indicating not only that the established laboratory culture procedures are suitable to maintain organisms under optimal conditions to be used in 48-hours postexposure feeding assays but also that there is a high flexibility in the use of the snails as test organisms.\nLastly, the influence of the organism size on the feeding rate of T. fluviatilis was also investigated in the present study, with organism of two different size classes. Not only no differences on nauplii consumption by T. fluviatilis were observed between the two size classes tested, but also no correlation between snail size, either shell height or length, and feeding rates was found. This result guarantees that potential differences in feeding rate are not associated with the size of the organisms, at least for organisms with a mean shell height and length of 4.02 to 4.86 mm and 5.05 to 6.12 mm, respectively.\n4.2\t- Endpoint sensitivity\nTheodoxus fluviatilis proved to be a very sensitive organism with 48- and 96hours LC50 values for cadmium of 208 and 141 ug/L, respectively. Indeed, this lethal toxicity parameter revealed T. fluviatilis to be more sensitive to cadmium, by three to 24 times, than other freshwater snail species, such as Physa acuta (48-hours LC50 of 1050\ngg/L; Cheung and Lam, 1998), Lymnaea stagnalis (48-hours LC50 of 583 gg/L; Slooff, 1983) and Filopaludina martensi (48- and 96-hours LC50 of 5010 and 2330 gg/L, respectively; Piyatiratitivorakula &amp; Boonchamoib, 2008), and with a similar sensitivity relatively to Aplexa hypnorum (96-hours LC50 of 93 gg/L; Holcombe et al., 1984).\nResults of the present study showed that after an exposure period of 48 hours to cadmium, the postexposure feeding and lethal responses of T. fluviatilis showed a similar sensitivity; the 48-hours EC50 was lower than the 48-hours LC50 by 1.2 times and higher than the 96-hours LC50 by 1.3 times, whereas the 48-hours EC20 was lower and higher than the 48- and 96-hours LC20 by 1.7 and 1.0 times, respectively. These findings were somehow unexpected given that previous studies demonstrated the postexposure feeding response to be more sensitive than lethality for different invertebrate species. For the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, the 48-hours EC50 for postexposure feeding was 4.6 and 2.4 more sensitive to copper than the 48- and 96hours LC50, respectively (Moreira et al., 2005). An even more sensitive postexposure feeding response was found for the crab Carcinus maenas after cadmium exposure, with the 48-hours postexposure feeding (EC50) more sensitive than lethality (LC50) by 6.5 and 3.2 times after a 48- and 96-hours exposure, respectively (Moreira et al., 2006a). Krell et al. (2011) found for the mudsnail H. ulvae exposed to copper, a postexposure feeding response (EC50) 3 times more sensitive than lethalilty (LC50) after exposure periods of 48 and 96 hours, respectively. Yet, in a study conducted with the freshwater amphipod Echinogammarus meridionalis exposed to copper for 48 hours, the EC50 for postexposure feeding was only two times more sensitive than lethality (LC50) (Agostinho et al., 2012). The absence of sublethal and lethal sensitivity differences found in the present study could be due to a physiological recovery of the organisms\nfrom the cadmium effects during the 3-hours postexposure feeding period. Further studies with different toxicants should be conducted to unravel this issue.\nFeeding depression and lethality appeared to contribute equally to a feeding depression at the population level since the sensitivity of both responses was similar. This means that the depression at the population level is due not only to the feeding depression of the organisms that are still alive, but also to the absence of feeding of the dead ones. Therefore, the recently proposed novel toxicity parameter (Krell et al., 2011; Agostinho et al., 2012) - immediate inhibition of population consumption (popEC50) -was calculated in order to integrate the survival and feeding depression in a single toxicity parameter to improve ecological realism. Two methods were used to calculate the popEC50, each having advantages and disadvantages. The first method calculated the popEC50 by multiplying, for each concentration, the individual feeding by the survival percentage, and thus has the advantage of allowing the computation of confidence limits. However, it increases the chance of violating the assumption of homoscedasticity in regression, since a strong association between feeding depression and mortality is expected. The second method, overcomes this drawback because it integrates the concentration-response relationships for feeding and survival after independent tests specifically designed to assess either lethality or feeding depression are carried out. However, this second technique assumes that feeding depression is constant over time and that there is no correlation between the tolerance to sublethal (feeding) and lethal levels of a toxicant. Violating this assumption may lead to an under or overestimation of risk. For instance, if organisms more sensitive to feeding depression are the ones that die faster, then the survivors will feed at a higher rate than the individual average of the initial population, partially compensating, at the population level, the loss of some individuals (the dead ones) (Krell et al., 2011; Agostinho et al.,\n2012). Both methods led to similar 48-hours popEC50 values (157 and 150 pg/L) with the second method revealing that at the 48-hours median lethal concentration (LC50), the immediate inhibition of population consumption would be 79%, which correspond to a very high disruption of the ecosystem function. Similar results through the two methods were also obtained by Krell et al., (2011) (75 and 68 pg/L) and Agostinho et al., (2012) (187 and 168 pg/L) for a mudsnail and an amphipod, respectively, exposed to copper.\n4.3\t- Influence of environmental exposure conditions on postexposure feeding\nThe influence of environmental conditions on the postexposure feeding rate was investigated because environmental conditions may act as confounding factors during in situ assays, not allowing to distinguish potential toxics effects from effects associated with the variability in environmental conditions across study sites (Moreira et al., 2005; Soares et al., 2005; Moreira et al., 2006a; Krell et al., 2012).\nFor all the investigated environmental exposure conditions (current velocity, hardness, conductivity, and sediment organic matter content and particle size distribution), the absence of a significant effect on the postexposure feeding rate of the freshwater snail T. fluviatlis indicated that the selected assay endpoint was not influenced by such variables. Therefore, sites with such different conditions can be directly compared for in situ evaluations with T. fluviatilis, but solely within the tested ranges. The temperature was not included in the model because its variation among the different sites was minimal. Therefore, caution should be taken when working with sites with different temperatures values. Significant effects of the temperature on the\npostexposure feeding were found in other studies (Soares et al., 2005; Moreira et al., 2005, 2006a, Krell et al., 2011).\n4.4\t- In situ assay effectiveness\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed in situ assay based on the postexposure feeding rate of the freshwater snail T. fluviatilis, organisms were deployed at two reference sites (R1 and R2) within the Mondego River basin and one reference site (R6) and five allegedly impacted sites (I1 to I5) within the Sado River basin. The eight organisms designed for postexposure feeding rate were easily recovered from the in situ assay chambers. This result demonstrated the suitability of the in situ chambers and procedures, as it has been verified for other organisms (Castro et al., 2004; Soares et al., 2005), enlarging thus the battery of the in situ assays available to perform toxicity assessments in rivers. No significant differences were found on the postexposure feeding rate of the T. fluviatilis across the three references sites. Therefore, the reference site selected in the Roxo River showed to be a valid reference to assess the effectiveness of the proposed in situ assay.\nGiven that only at the impacted site located furthest downstream the dilution gradient of the mine effluent (site I5 practically at the confluence of the Agua Forte Stream with the Roxo River) live organisms were found (63%), only one impacted site could be used to evaluate the postexposure feeding depression of the T. fluviatilis. However, since a significant postexposure feeding depression of 46% was detected for the organisms that were alive, the feeding depression of the organisms exposed at site I5 demonstrated that T. fluviatilis postexposure feeding is a potential responsive sublethal endpoint. Moreover, the immediate effect on the consumption at the population level,\nby integrating mortality and feeding inhibition at I5, would be 71%, which corresponds\nto a very high disruption of the snails ecosystem function.\nChapter 5\nConclusion\nThe short-term sublethal in situ assay based on the postexposure feeding of the freshwater snail T. fluviatilis proposed in the present study showed to be a potential valuable tool to be added to the battery of in situ assays developed in recent years to assess contaminant effects in freshwater aquatic systems, particularly in rivers. The species T. fluviatilis was easy to collect, transport, maintain under laboratory cultures, and manipulate, and has a key role in the functioning of river ecosystems, all essential characteristics for its proposal as a test species. The methodologies here proposed for the in situ deployment and retrieval of the organisms and to quantify postexposure feeding rates are simple and short-demanding in time and effort, and thus inexpensive, allowing a rapid estimation of the response of snails to contaminants, all critical aspects for the assessment and monitoring of environmental quality, especially now in the context of the Water Framework Directive (Allan et al., 2006). In particular, the integration of the postexposure feeding response and lethal effects in a single parameter (immediate inhibitory population consumption) may be useful to provide a more relevant evaluation on potential toxicant impacts directly at the population level and thus on key ecosystem functions.\nReferences\nREFERENCES\nAdams S.M.
