O Brasil constitui \num caso particularmente interessante no contexto de interven\u00e7\u00e3o do governo em setores dom\u00e9sticos \nde combust\u00edveis: A empresa petrol\u00edfera estatal Petrobras atua como price-setter para todos os \nderivados de petr\u00f3leo comercializados no pa\u00eds. Essa pol\u00edtica, no entanto, trouxe graves conseq\u00fc\u00eancias \nnegativas para o setor brasileiro de combust\u00edveis \u2013 e especialmente para a ind\u00fastria nacional de etanol. \nNesse contexto, o principal objetivo deste estudo foi fornecer uma base para o desenvolvimento de \numa pol\u00edtica de pre\u00e7os reformada, que seja mais adequada \u00e0s necessidades do pa\u00eds e n\u00e3o tenha um \nimpacto t\u00e3o negativo para a economia dom\u00e9stica. Para tanto, a presente pesquisa foi dividida em tr\u00eas \ncap\u00edtulos distintos. O primeiro cap\u00edtulo aborda uma an\u00e1lise comparativa da correla\u00e7\u00e3o din\u00e2mica entre \nos pre\u00e7os dom\u00e9sticos dos combust\u00edveis e o pre\u00e7o internacional do petr\u00f3leo para o Brasil, a Alemanha \ne os Estados Unidos. Os resultados da estimativa de um modelo MGARCH-DCC realizada para os \ntr\u00eas pa\u00edses fornecem evid\u00eancias emp\u00edricas das diferen\u00e7as existentes entre o pass-through da \nvolatilidade do mercado internacional de petr\u00f3leo para a economia dom\u00e9stica. O estabelecimento \nartificial dos pre\u00e7os de refinaria pelo governo brasileiro levou a uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o menor em compara\u00e7\u00e3o \n\u00e0 Alemanha e aos EUA \u2013 dois pa\u00edses onde o governo n\u00e3o interv\u00e9m nos pre\u00e7os dos combust\u00edveis. \nUma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edtica de pre\u00e7o dos derivados do petr\u00f3leo livre e uma pol\u00edtica fiscal flex\u00edvel \ncomo na Alemanh\u00e3 poderia trazer competitividade para o setor dom\u00e9stico de combust\u00edveis e ao \nmesmo tempo garantir um pre\u00e7o est\u00e1vel ao consumidor \u2013 um exemplo que deve ser considerado pelo \ngoverno brasileiro. O segundo cap\u00edtulo vai um passo al\u00e9m, incluindo os setores de biocombust\u00edveis na \nan\u00e1lise, a fim de verificar se existem diferen\u00e7as nos mecanismos de transmiss\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os relacionados \naos biocombust\u00edveis nos tr\u00eas pa\u00edses estudados. Os resultados obtidos nos testes de cointegra\u00e7\u00e3o e na \nestimativa de um modelo VEC mostram que, enquanto no Brasil e nos EUA os setores de etanol se \ncaracterizam por uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1vel entre as s\u00e9ries de pre\u00e7os examinadas, na Alemanha n\u00e3o se \nobserva um v\u00ednculo t\u00e3o forte e permanente \u2013 um resultado que pode ser atribu\u00eddo \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as na \npol\u00edtica de biocombust\u00edveis no pa\u00eds, bem como \u00e0s caracter\u00edsticas espec\u00edficas de seus setores de \nbiocombust\u00edveis. O terceiro cap\u00edtulo do estudo d\u00e1 continuidade \u00e0 an\u00e1lise, focando na situa\u00e7\u00e3o do \nBrasil e nos efeitos hipot\u00e9ticos de uma pol\u00edtica de pre\u00e7os livres dos combust\u00edveis. Uma simula\u00e7\u00e3o de \npre\u00e7o livre para a gasolina no per\u00edodo entre 2007 e 2016 foi constru\u00eddo e as respostas hipot\u00e9ticas do \nsetor de etanol foram calculadas, usando as elasticidades da demanda obtidas pela estima\u00e7\u00e3o de um \nmodelo VEC estrutural. Os resultados mostram que uma pol\u00edtica mais liberal teria levado ao aumento \nno pre\u00e7o do etanol no estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, tornando a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol mais lucrativa do que o \na\u00e7\u00facar para os produtores de cana, o que teria sido ben\u00e9fico para o setor \u2013 especialmente depois de \n2011, quando ele entrou em uma grave crise. A conclus\u00e3o final deste trabalho \u00e9 de que se faz \nnecess\u00e1ria uma reformula\u00e7\u00e3o da pol\u00edtica de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os praticada no Brasil, a fim de ajudar o \netanol a recuperar sua competitividade como substituto a combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis e a se restabelecer na \nmatriz energ\u00e9tica do pa\u00eds. \n\nPalavras-chave: Pol\u00edtica de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os; Biocombust\u00edveis; Compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre pa\u00edses \ndiferentes\n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nFuel and biofuel sectors in Brazil \u2013 comparison with developed economies and analysis of \n\nhypothetical free fuel pricing policy \n\nThe recent trends in the international crude oil price have brought back the interest of \nresearchers to the importance of the practiced by the government fuel pricing policy for the domestic \neconomy, especially in the developing world. Brazil constitutes a particularly interesting case when it \ncomes to the government participation in the domestic fuel sectors. The state-owned oil company \nPetrobras acts as a price-setter for all petroleum derivatives sold in the country. This policy, however, \nhas had severe negative consequences for the Brazilian fuel sector and especially for the domestic \nethanol industry. Thus, the main goal of this study is to provide a basis for the development of a \nreformed pricing policy, which is more suitable for the needs of the country and does not have severe \nnegative impact on the domestic economy. For this purpose, this work is divided into three chapters \nthat interrelate and contribute for the achieving of the objective. The first chapter focuses on a \ncomparative analysis of the dynamic correlation between the domestic fuel prices and international \ncrude oil in Brazil, Germany and the United States. The results of the performed MGARCH-DCC \nestimation for the three countries provide empirical evidence for the differences existing between the \npass-through of volatility from international oil markets to the domestic economy. The artificially \nestablished by the government ex-refinery prices of petroleum derivatives in Brazil led to lower \ncorrelation in comparison to Germany and the U.S. - two countries where the government does not \nintervene in the formation of the prices of petroleum derivatives. The used combination of free fuel \nprices and flexible fiscal policy, as the case of Germany, can induce competitiveness in the domestic \nfuel sector and at the same time keep domestic prices stable \u2013 an example that should be considered \nby policy makers in Brazil. The second chapter goes one step further by including the biofuel sectors \nin the analysis in order to verify if there exist differences in the biofuel-related price transmission \nmechanisms in the three countries of interest. The obtained results of the performed cointegration \ntests and estimation of VECM show that while in Brazil and in the U.S. the ethanol sectors are \ncharacterized by a stable relationship between the examined price series, in Germany such a strong \nand permanent link is not observed \u2013 a result that can be attributed to the changes in the policy \nregarding biofuels in the country, as well as to the specific characteristics of its biofuel-related sectors. \nThe third chapter of the study gives a continuation to the analysis by focusing on the situation in \nBrazil and the hypothetical effects of a free fuel pricing policy. A simulated free gasoline price for the \nperiod between 2007 and 2016 is constructed and the hypothetical responses of the ethanol sector are \ncalculated, using the obtained by the estimation of a structural VEC model demand elasticities. The \nresults show that such a change in the policy would have led to higher ethanol prices in the state of \nS\u00e3o Paulo, making it more profitable for sugarcane producers to engage in the production of biofuel \ninstead of sugar, which would have been beneficial for the sector, especially after 2011 when it entered \na severe crisis. The final conclusion of this work is that there is a need for reformulating the practiced \nfuel pricing policy in Brazil in order to help ethanol regain its previous competitiveness as a substitute \nfor conventional fossil fuels and to reestablish itself in the country\u2019s energy matrix. \n\nKeywords: Fuel pricing policy; Biofuels; Country comparison \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nThe understanding of the pass-through from international crude oil markets to domestic fuel sectors has \n\nbeen a relevant topic of research, especially after 2015, when the international crude oil price registered a significant \n\ndecrease. This trend had an impact on the world economy (DEV; CHAUBEY, 2016) and highlighted the issue of \n\npetroleum product pricing in a number of developing economies (FATTOUH; OLIVEIRA; SEN, 2015), some of \n\nwhich have adapted their domestic fuel policies to the changing environment. Moreover, the increased production \n\nand use of biofuels as substitutes for conventional fossil fuels worldwide after 2005, has introduced another element \n\nin the transmission mechanism in the oil-related sectors, which altered the price relationship between international \n\ncrude oil, domestic fuels and agricultural crops (PERI; BALDI, 2010).  \n\nBrazil is one of the major consumers of crude oil and fossil fuels in the world (EIA, 2017). The domestic \n\nfuel sector is characterized by indirect government intervention in the pricing of all petroleum derivatives. The state-\n\ncontrolled company Petrobras acts as a price-setter, establishing the ex-refinery price of gasoline, diesel and liquefied \n\npetroleum gas (LPG). The practiced fuel pricing in the country, however, relies on irregular adjustments without a \n\ntransparent and well-defined formula and the artificially established low domestic fuel prices have brought \n\nimbalances to the domestic economy, and especially to Petrobras (SERIGATI, 2014).  \n\nIn addition, Brazil is a world leader in the production and consumption of biofuels. It is one of the only \n\ncountries in the world where ethanol produced from sugarcane acts as a substitute for gasoline, due to the \n\nintroduction of the flex-fuel vehicle in 2003, which allowed the final consumer to choose freely between these two \n\nfuel alternatives. This specific characteristic of the biofuel industry in Brazil implies the existence of a distinct \n\nrelationship between the domestic biofuel and fuel sectors. In addition, a unique link between ethanol and sugar \n\nmarkets is observed in the country, since the two products have the same feedstock and are considered competitors \n\non the supply side.  \n\nIn recent years, however, the Brazilian ethanol industry suffered a severe crisis, characterized by \n\ninsufficient supply and a significant drop in the total production of ethanol, due to a number of factors that have \n\ntheir origins in the financial crisis of 2008. The global turmoil resulted in high BRL/USD exchange rate and led to a \n\nperiod of oversupply on the international sugar market. In the years after the crisis, the world price of sugar \n\nregistered an increasing trend, which was followed by a rise in the domestic price of this commodity in Brazil, \n\nmaking the production of sugar much more attractive to sugarcane producers instead of ethanol. Moreover, the \n\nunfavorable climatic conditions in the country during this period, the increasing production costs for ethanol, the \n\nlack of financing, the insufficient government stimuli towards the production and use of biofuels in combination \n\nwith the practiced policy of controlled domestic fossil fuel prices aggravated the crisis in the ethanol sector. The \n\nstagnation of the industry and the negative consequences of the implicit government intervention in the formation of \n\nfuel prices have raised the question of a policy reform regarding the fuel and biofuel industries in Brazil \n\n(PALACIOS, 2015).  \n\nAn important initial step before considering an alternative fuel pricing policy, however, is the better \n\nunderstanding of the way different government policies and taxation alter the relationship between the domestic fuel \n\nand biofuel sectors, as well as the pass-through from the international crude oil market to the domestic economy. A \n\ncomparative analysis of the situation in Brazil with other countries can provide important insights about the factors \n\nthat drive the price transmission in the oil-related sectors, so that a reformed pricing policy that serves better the \n\nneeds of the domestic economy can be developed. In particular, a comparison with countries that practice different \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nfuel policies, but at the same time are engaged in the production and consumption of biofuels, is proposed in the \n\npresent study as a crucial first step for the analysis of the possible policy alternatives for Brazil.  \n\nThe United States is currently the leading producer of biofuels in the world (EIA, 2017). The country \n\nrelies on the production of ethanol from corn, which is used mainly for blending with conventional gasoline in low \n\npercentages (from 5 to 15%). Pure ethanol is not widely used in the U.S., which implies that biofuels and \n\nconventional fossil fuels act as complements. In addition, the domestic fuel sector in the country is not subject to \n\nany government intervention in the price formation of petroleum derivatives, whose prices are a result of the supply \n\nand demand conditions on the market.  \n\nIn Europe, the biggest producer and consumer of biofuels is Germany, which is also a global leader in the \n\nproduction of biodiesel (EIA, 2017). The country has a pioneering role in the promotion and adoption of \n\ngovernment policies stimulating the biofuel sector, which have served as an example for other member countries of \n\nthe European Union. Biodiesel in Germany is produced mainly form rapeseed oil and is available as a blend with \n\nconventional diesel and in a pure form as a substitute. Moreover, as is the case of the U.S., the German government \n\ndoes not intervene in the domestic fuel sector, which is characterized by freely fluctuating petroleum derivative \n\nprices. \n\nBoth Germany and the U.S. represent interesting cases for comparison with Brazil, since the three \n\ncountries exhibit significant differences when it comes to market specifications and government policies regarding \n\nfuels and biofuels. It is interesting to observe and compare the distinct impact that specific policy and market \n\ninstruments have on the biofuel-related price transmission mechanisms and the pass-through of volatility from the \n\ninternational crude oil market to the domestic economy. The findings of such a comparative analysis could be \n\nparticularly useful for policy makers, since they could provide knowledge and better understanding of the impacts of \n\ndifferent policy regimes and market conditions on the domestic fuel and biofuel markets. Such knowledge is crucial \n\nfor many other economic agents as well, such as market operators and traders, agricultural producers, fuel and \n\nbiofuel refiners, since it can affect their decisions to produce, invest and adopt mechanisms for protecting their \n\nproduction from different risks.  \n\nAnother essential step before deciding on a reform in the practiced fuel and biofuel policies is the study \n\nof the hypothetical effects of different regimes on the domestic economy. Empirical analysis of hypothetical \n\nscenarios with different degrees of government intervention in the domestic fuel sector in Brazil could provide \n\nimportant insights for policy makers on the potential effects of a change in the practiced policy and could serve as a \n\nbasis for the establishment of a policy reform in the country. \n\nThe main objective of this work is to examine the fuel and biofuel sectors in Brazil from a comparative \n\npoint of view, in order to shed light on the effects different government fuel pricing policies and market \n\nspecifications have on these sectors. In addition, the impact of a hypothetical situation, in which the government was \n\nnot intervening in the price formation of gasoline in the country, is included in the performed analysis. The goal is to \n\nprovide a better understanding of the situation in Brazil, which can offer a basis for a reform in the practiced fuel \n\npricing policy by the government, considered to be essential for the further development of the domestic economy \n\n(VIEGAS, 2011; OLIVEIRA; ALMEIDA, 2015; ALMEIDA; OLIVEIRA; LOSEKANN, 2015; AZEVEDO; \n\nSERIGATI, 2015).   \n\nFor achieving the main objective, the present thesis is divided into three chapters. The analysis starts with \n\na comparison between the fuel sectors in Brazil, Germany and the U.S., focusing on the differences between the \n\nspecific sector characteristics, pricing policies, and fuel price disparities in each of the three examined economies. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nThe empirical part of the study is devoted to the comparison between the dynamic volatilities of domestic gasoline \n\nand diesel prices and their correlation with the international crude oil price. The main idea is to examine how \n\ngovernment policies and market characteristics of the fuel sectors alter the relationship between the domestic fuel \n\nprices and international crude oil. Using average monthly data for the period July, 2005 \u2013 November, 2016, a \n\nDynamic Conditional Correlation Multivariate General Autoregressive Heteroscedasticity (MGARCH-DCC) model \n\nis estimated for the three countries of interest, in order to determine the dynamic volatility of the price series over \n\ntime and the conditional quasi-correlations between the domestic fuel prices and international crude oil. The results \n\nof the suggested comparative analysis could provide important insights for the way different government policies and \n\ntaxation affect the pass-through of volatility from the international crude oil market to the domestic economy, which \n\nfor the specific case of Brazil is rather important for the consideration of fuel sector policy reforms. \n\nThe second chapter of this thesis goes one step further in the comparative analysis by introducing the \n\neffects of the biofuel sectors in the three examined economies in the empirical study. The focus of this chapter is the \n\nthorough analysis of the price transmission in the biofuel-related sectors in Brazil, Germany and the U.S. in order to \n\nidentify how different market specifications alter the price linkages between fuels, biofuels and main feedstock. \n\nA number of studies were published after 2005 analyzing the biofuel-related price transmission in Brazil \n\nand in the U.S., especially due to the existing food versus fuel debate raised by environmentalist groups in recent \n\nyears as criticism to domestic biofuel stimulation policies. A thorough literature review of these studies is presented \n\nin Serra and Zilberman (2013), according to which the data used, the modelling techniques and the main findings of \n\nthe literature differ significantly, which does not allow comparison across different papers and countries. Moreover, \n\nit is expected that different market characteristics and government policies result in different specifics of the \n\ndomestic price relationships between the biofuel-related sectors, as pointed out by Kristoufek, Janda and Zilberman \n\n(2013). Thus, the second chapter of this thesis focuses on performing a comparative analysis, using the same \n\nmethodology, data types and frequency for the three chosen economies with an emphasis on the possible causes for \n\nthe discovered differences in the biofuel-related price transmission mechanisms.  \n\nIn addition, the possible effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 on the price linkages in the three \n\ncountries is accounted for in the analysis by splitting the sample into two sub-periods. The empirical part of the \n\nstudy is based on time-series techniques including stationarity and cointegration tests and the estimation of specific \n\nvector autoregression models for each country with or without error-correction terms, depending on the results of \n\nthe performed a priori testing procedures. The used data consists of monthly average producer prices for the period \n\nJuly, 2005 \u2013 November, 2016. In particular, the price linkages between the ethanol, sugar and gasoline are examined \n\nfor Brazil, between ethanol, corn and gasoline for the U.S., and between biodiesel, rapeseed oil and diesel for \n\nGermany.  \n\nThe better understanding of the effects that government policies and market characteristics have on the \n\nprice transmission in the domestic biofuel-related sectors can provide additional knowledge for the development of \n\npolicy reforms for countries like Brazil. The second chapter of the thesis serves as an important continuation of the \n\nfirst one, deepening the understanding of the interrelations between the fuel and biofuel sectors and creating a more \n\nstable basis for the establishment of an alternative policy regarding fuels and biofuels in Brazil.  \n\nAfter performing a comparative analysis of the situation in Brazil with Germany and the U.S., the thesis \n\nproceeds with the study of a hypothetical situation in which the Brazilian government adopted a fuel pricing policy in \n\n2007, similar to the one practiced in the other two examined countries, where gasoline prices are allowed to \n\naccompany the international crude oil price fluctuations. Thus, the main objective of the third chapter of the thesis is \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nto shed light on the possible effects that such pricing policy would have had on the domestic ethanol sector. More \n\nprecisely, the hypothetical impact of no government intervention in the fuel sector on biofuel prices and demanded \n\nquantities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo for the period 2007-2016 is examined. For this purpose, a simulated freely \n\nfluctuation consumer price of gasoline C was constructed, using the provided by DATAGRO series of \u201cinterned\u201d \n\ngasoline A price, which is based on the RBOB spot price and accounts for all additional costs incurred in the import \n\nof fuels to the Brazilian market.  \n\nIn order to perform the hypothetical analysis, first the elasticities of fuel and biofuel demand, as well as \n\nthe response of the domestic ethanol price to changes in the price of gasoline, are estimated by fitting a structural \n\nvector error-correction (SVEC) model to the data that incorporates the specific characteristics of the fuel and biofuel \n\nsectors in Brazil. The variables included in the model consist of monthly average data series for the state of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo for the period January, 2007 - June, 2016. The estimated contemporaneous responses of the variables to \n\nchanges in the price of gasoline are used afterwards for the calculation of the hypothetical ethanol price for a \n\nscenario with no government intervention in the domestic fuel sector and the consecutive effects on the demanded \n\nquantities of ethanol and gasoline.  \n\nAlthough some authors have examined the effects of simulated free fuel prices on the domestic inflation \n\nrates and on the price of ethanol in the country (SERIGATI, 2014; CORR\u00caA; TEIXEIRA, 2014; CUNHA, 2015; \n\nCOSTA; BURNQUIST, 2016), a thorough hypothetical analysis of the absence of government intervention in the \n\ndomestic fuel sector in Brazil has not been previously performed. Thus, the third chapter of the study aims at \n\ncontributing to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence on the possible effects of a fuel pricing policy \n\nthat relies on free prices without any government intervention. \n\nAll in all, the idea behind this thesis is to provide a basis for further investigation of the possible paths for \n\nchanges in the practiced fuel pricing policy in Brazil. There is a need of a reform that would mitigate the negative \n\nconsequences of the policy currently practiced in the country and would provide incentives for the production and \n\nconsumption of ethanol.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nALMEIDA, E.L.F.; OLIVEIRA, P.V.; LOSEKANN, L.

DOMESTIC FUEL SECTORS AND INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL PRICE \u2013 A \n\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN BRAZIL, GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES \n\n \nABSTRACT \n\nThe main focus of this paper is the analysis of the correlation between the domestic gasoline \nand diesel prices in Brazil, in the United States and in Germany, and the international crude oil price. \nSuch a comparative study provides important insights on the way different government policies and \nmarket characteristics alter the relationship between domestic fuel prices and international crude oil. \nUsing monthly data for the period July, 2005 \u2013 November, 2016, a Dynamic Conditional Correlation \nMultivariate General Autoregressive Heteroscedasticity (MGARCH-DCC) model is estimated for the \nthree chosen economies. The obtained results provide empirical evidence that different government \nfuel pricing policies and taxation alter the correlation between domestic fuel prices and international \ncrude oil. The artificially established by the government ex-refinery prices of petroleum derivatives in \nBrazil led to lower correlation between domestic fuel prices and oil in comparison to Germany and \nthe United States - two countries where the government does not intervene in the formation of \ndomestic fuel prices. In addition, the findings of the study show that the estimated correlations for \nBrazil and the U.S. exhibit significant time-varying behavior, while such a result was not found for the \nGerman market, where the oil-gasoline and the oil-diesel correlations remained rather stable through \ntime. This result indicates that a combination of freely fluctuating fuel prices and flexible fiscal policy, \nas the one existing in Germany, introduces competitiveness to the domestic fuel sector, while, at the \nsame time, keeps domestic fuel prices stable through time. The lack of such a consensus between the \npracticed fuel pricing policy and taxation in Brazil can be considered the main reason for the negative \nconsequences of keeping fuel prices at levels different than their international equivalents. \n\nKeywords: International crude oil price; Domestic fuel prices; Volatility; MGARCH-DCC model \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nInternational crude oil prices are more dynamic than the prices of other commodities and affect many \n\nsectors of the economy, due to the fact that oil is used for the production and transportation of a vast majority of \n\nitems that are used on a regular basis \u2013 from fuels, to fertilizers, medicine, plastics and clothing. In general, the \n\nhistorical oil price trend has been characterized by strong fluctuations and high volatility. Until June 2014, oil prices \n\nremained relatively high and in line with rising global demand (EIA, 2016). In the second half of 2015, however, this \n\ntrend was reversed and oil prices registered a significant decrease. During the first two months of 2016, OPEC crude \n\noil prices sat at an average of 27.63 USD/barrel - a decrease from an average annual price of 96.29 USD/barrel in \n\n2014 (EIA, 2016).  \n\nThe recent oil price decrease has brought back the relevance of the analysis of the relationship between \n\ninternational crude oil and domestic fuel prices. In addition, this situation has posed challenges for developing \n\ncountries in regards to reforms in their petroleum product pricing policies, which in general include some degree of \n\ngovernment control of the domestic fuel sector. Brazil is an example of a developing economy in need of a policy \n\nreform regarding the domestic fuel sector, mainly due to the severe corruption scandal in which the national oil \n\ncompany Petrobras has been involved in recent years (PALACIOS, 2015). A comparative analysis of the situation in \n\nBrazil with other countries can provide important insights on the factors that drive the pass-through from \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\ninternational oil prices to the domestic fuel sector, so that a reformed pricing policy that serves better the needs of \n\nthe domestic economy can be developed.  \n\nThe goal of the present study is to analyze the differences between the oil-related sectors in Brazil, in the \n\nUnited States and in Germany \u2013 three countries with rather distinct characteristics when it comes to market \n\nspecifications and government pricing policies of the fuel sectors. The main focus is the analysis of the correlation \n\nbetween the domestic gasoline and diesel prices in the three countries of interest and the international crude oil price, \n\nwhich can shed light on the way different government policies and market characteristics alter the relationship \n\nbetween the domestic fuel sectors and international crude oil. The empirical study is based on the estimation of a \n\nDynamic Conditional Correlation Multivariate General Autoregressive Heteroscedasticity (MGARCH-DCC) model, \n\nusing monthly data for the period July, 2005 \u2013 November, 2016. \n\nA number of authors have discussed the price transmission between domestic fuel prices and \n\ninternational crude oil, especially due to the increased production and use of biofuels in recent years. For Brazil, the \n\nresults of Cavalcanti, Szklo and Machado (2011) have shown no effective price relationship between gasoline and \n\ninternational crude oil, while Prado, Rodarte and Bonfim (2015) found a correlation between Brazilian gasoline and \n\ndiesel prices and the international price of oil, but this correlation was not found to be as significant as in other \n\ncountries. For Germany, Pokrivcak and Rajcaniova (2011) have demonstrated that there exists a long-term \n\nrelationship between domestic gasoline prices and the price of Europe Brent oil. Studies for the U.S. market have \n\nprovided evidence for a relationship between crude oil and energy prices, characterized by a significant asymmetric \n\nprice transmission, where gasoline prices increase faster when crude oil prices rise and they fall more slowly when \n\ncrude oil prices drop (BORENSTEIN et al., 1997; ATIL et al., 2014; BREMMER; KESSELRING, 2016).  \n\nPrice volatility links between domestic fuel sectors and international crude oil prices, however, have \n\nreceived much less attention in the existing literature. Previous research has shown that between 2009 and 2015 fuel \n\nprice volatility has increased due to the greater transmission of international oil price volatility to domestic fuel \n\nsectors (GILBERT; MUGERA, 2014). Ara\u00fajo (2006) found that domestic fuel prices in Brazil do not accompany the \n\nhigh volatility of international crude oil prices between 2002 and 2006. Rahman (2016) found that in the United \n\nStates oil price volatility affects positively the price of gasoline and contributes to the asymmetries in the \n\ntransmission between these two price series.   \n\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows: Section 2.2 is dedicated to a comparative analysis of \n\nthe main characteristics of the fuel sectors in the three examined countries; Section 2.3 describes the methodology \n\nand the data used in the study; Section 2.4 presents the obtained results; and Section 2.5 concludes with final \n\nremarks. \n\n \n\n2.2. Characteristics of the domestic fuel sectors  \n\n2.2.1. Profile of the three countries of interest \n\nIn 2015, Brazil ranked among the top ten producers of crude oil worldwide, according to the U.S. Energy \n\nInformation Administration. The country has the second-largest reserves of crude oil in Latin America, following \n\nVenezuela, which accounts for about 1% of the world\u2019s total reserves. The majority of these reserves (more than \n\n94%) are located off-shore, 80% of which are found near Rio de Janeiro (EIA, 2017). Considerable amount comes \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nfrom the discovered in the beginning of the 2000s pre-salt oil reserves, which accounted for about a quarter of total \n\nBrazilian oil output in 2015 (EIA, 2016).  \n\nBrazil's consumption of oil and other conventional fossil fuels continues to surpass its production. In \n\n2014, the domestic demand for petroleum and other liquid fuels was 3.2 million b/d (EIA, 2016). The country\u2019s \n\ncrude oil exports in 2014 increased 36% in comparison to the previous year. Currently, the United States is the \n\nlargest importer of Brazilian crude oil, followed by China and India. When it comes to oil imports, the regions that \n\nexported the largest volumes of crude oil to Brazil in the past few years were Africa and the Middle East, accounting \n\nfor 68.7% and 26.3%, respectively, of the total imported quantities. \n\n The United States is the main producer and consumer of crude oil worldwide. According to the EIA, in \n\n2015, the U.S. was the number one global oil producing country, followed by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Until 2008, \n\ncrude oil production in the country was following a decreasing trend, which was reversed in 2009. The recent \n\nincrease in U.S. oil production has been a result of the exploration of unconventional shale oil resources, which have \n\nbecome more accessible and economically viable.  \n\nOil demand in the country has been rising steadily over the last decades. The U.S. is currently the top \n\nconsumer worldwide, responsible for approximately one fifth of the total global oil consumption (EIA, \n\n2016). Moreover, the U.S. is the world\u2019s leading oil importer. When it comes to oil reserves, the country ranked on \n\n10th place in 2015 (EIA, 2016). The Gulf Coast accounts for about 50% of the U.S. refining capacity, and another \n\n21% is located in the Midwest. Export destinations for U.S. refined petroleum products include Mexico, Central and \n\nSouth America, and Western Europe. \nPetroleum and its derivatives continue to be Germany's main source of energy. In 2015, the country \n\nranked as the fifth main consumer of crude oil worldwide and the number one energy consumer in Europe (EIA, \n\n2016). Germany has little domestic oil and natural gas production and relies heavily on imports. Currently, it is one \n\nof the top five global crude oil importers. The country has well diversified and flexible oil supply infrastructure, \n\nwhich consists of pipelines and import terminals. In addition, Germany is one of the largest oil refiners in the world, \n\nand the second largest in Europe and Eurasia after Russia (EIA, 2016).  \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Profile of the domestic fuel sectors \n\nIn Brazil, the transportation sector accounts for the largest share of the demand for petroleum products. \n\nGasoline produced by refineries in the country is pure, free of biofuel additives and is referred to as gasoline A. Pure \n\ngasoline, however, is not available to the final consumer. The gasoline that reaches retail stations in Brazil is a blend \n\nwith ethanol and is referred to as gasoline C. Currently, the proportion of ethanol in this gasoline blend is 27% \n\n(NPA, 2017). This percentage, however, has been gradually increasing through time and has been used by the \n\ngovernment as an indirect measure for controlling domestic biofuel demand.  \n\nDiesel consumption in the country is restricted primarily to the agricultural sector and road \n\ntransportation, mainly heavy duty vehicles (buses and trucks) used for massive transit and load. Since January, 2008 it \n\nhas been mandatory for all automotive diesel fuel marketed in Brazil to be blended with biodiesel produced from \n\nplant oils or animal fat. Currently, the proportion of biodiesel represents 8% of the diesel blend sold at the pumps \n\nand this percentage is expected to reach 10% in 2019 (NPA, 2017).  \n\nGrade A gasoline and pure diesel in Brazil can be produced by the state-owned company Petrobras, by \n\nother refineries or formulators and petrochemical plants, and they can be imported by companies authorized to do \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nso by the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels - NPA. Afterwards, the fuels are sold to the \n\nseveral distributors operating in the country, mixed with the respective biofuel and sold to consumers through \n\nthousands of service stations spread throughout the country. Currently, there are 76 companies operating in the oil \n\nindustry in Brazil, with 39 national and 38 foreign companies in addition to Petrobras, which remains the largest oil \n\nproducer and refiner in the country (EIA, 2016).  \n\nIn the United States, gasoline is one of the major fuels consumed domestically and it is the main product \n\nrefined from crude oil. There are three main grades of gasoline sold at retail refueling stations in the country: \n\nRegular, Midgrade, and Premium. These grades indicate the octane rating of the fuel, with higher ratings resulting in \n\nhigher prices. In addition, a special gasoline blend called Reformulated gasoline (RFG) can be found in some regions \n\nof the U.S. with high air pollution levels, since it is cleaner than conventional gasoline and reduces smog-forming and \n\ntoxic particles in the air. Currently, about 30% of total gasoline sold in the country is reformulated (EIA, 2016). \n\nDiesel fuel in the U.S. is used in most freight trucks, trains, buses, boats, and farm and construction vehicles. Blends \n\nof up to 20% biodiesel (B20) can generally be used in unmodified diesel engines. A small amount of diesel fuel is \n\nimported.  \n\n Gasoline and diesel in the U.S. are shipped from the refinery by pipelines to terminals near consuming \n\nareas, where they may be blended with other products to meet local government and market specifications. The fuels \n\nare then delivered by tanker trucks to individual retail stations. Some retail outlets are owned and operated by \n\nrefiners, while others are independent businesses that purchase gasoline from refiners and marketers and are \n\nunbranded.  \n\nGermany has the highest demand for gasoline and diesel in the European Union after France. The \n\ncommon fuel types sold at retail stations in the country are the following: gasoline \u2013 Super E5, with up to 5% of \n\nethanol; Super E10, with 10% ethanol; and diesel. Diesel is highly used in Germany, which is a common trend for \n\nEuropean countries. The shift from gasoline to diesel in the EU began 20 years ago and has led to excess gasoline \n\nproduction capacity and a corresponding shortage of diesel production. The transportation sector in Germany \n\naccounts for the largest share of petroleum product demand (EIA, 2016). The German government, however, has a \n\ngoal of reducing the country\u2019s oil dependence and putting one million electric vehicles on the road by 2020 and six \n\nmillion by 2030 (EIA, 2016).  \n\nThe retail market for gasoline and other conventional fossil fuels in Germany is dominated by an \n\noligopoly of five vertically integrated oil companies that have a large network of stations and direct access to refining \n\ncapacities: Aral, Shell, JET, Esso and Total (FRONDEL; VANCE; KIHM, 2015). In order to increase the \n\ncompetition in the retail sector, German retail stations are legally obligated to post online every price change, the \n\nprecise time stamp, the geographic coordinates of the station, the opening hours, and the brand. The density of fuel \n\nstations in the country varies significantly across regions, with a high density, for instance, in the Rhine-Main area \n\nand a considerably lower density in the Eastern part of the country. Fewer gasoline stations are located close to \n\nborders with countries that usually have lower fuel prices, like Poland and Luxembourg (EIA, 2016). \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Fuel pricing \n\nFuel pricing policies and taxation are the main tools used by governments in order to influence domestic \n\nfuel prices. According to Pires and Schechtman (2010), fuel pricing policies can be divided into three main \n\ncategories: ad hoc decisions, automatic adjustments through formulas, and market prices. The first type occurs when \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nfuel prices are adjusted as a result of macroeconomic factors or political considerations by the government or by a \n\ncompany, which is directly or indirectly controlled by the State. Usually the adjustments happen in irregular time \n\nintervals and the used criteria are non-transparent. Countries following this mechanism include Brazil, China, India, \n\nand Indonesia. The second type of policy, which is practiced in South Africa, Bolivia, Chile, Pakistan and Peru, for \n\ninstance, relies on previously determined formulas by the government or by the national oil company. The \n\nadjustments occur automatically in certain periods of time, which makes this mechanism more transparent than the \n\nfirst one. The third policy is practiced in most OECD countries, where prices of oil derivatives are driven by the \n\nmarket conditions and the role of the government is reduced to taxation. Germany and the United States fall into \n\nthis category.  \n\nRegarding fuel taxation, two main types of taxes are usually applied, according to Pires and Schechtman \n\n(2010) \u2013 specific tributes, which have a fixed value, such as excise taxes or duties and transportation taxes, and value-\n\nadded taxes (VATs), which are fixed as a percentage of the final fuel price. Differences in the fuel pricing policy and \n\ntaxation result in divergence of domestic fuel prices from the international crude oil price and in addition generate \n\nsignificant price dissimilarities among countries.  \n\nIn Brazil, Petrobras is the dominant participant in the domestic oil-related sectors, holding important \n\npositions in upstream, midstream, and downstream activities. The company held a monopoly until 1997, when the \n\ngovernment opened the sector to competition. The liberalization process was effectively completed in 2002, and \n\ncurrently, there is no official government control over the industry. Nevertheless, fuel prices in Brazil are not entirely \n\nfree to follow international crude oil price fluctuations. The ex-refinery prices of all petroleum derivatives are set and \n\nadjusted by Petrobras. The price adjustments use as a reference the variations in the Brent crude oil price and the \n\nUSD exchange rate published by the Central Bank of Brazil. The established pricing system aims at diminishing the \n\nnegative effects that volatile fuel prices accompanying the fluctuations in the international crude oil price, would have \n\non the inflation rate (FATTOUH; OLIVEIRA; SEN, 2015). Moreover, the Brazilian government frequently adjusts \n\ntaxation in order to maintain the domestic fuel price stable in times of high international crude oil prices. The federal \n\nflat-rate fuel tax CIDE has been altered four times since 2010 and remained zero between June, 2012 and February, \n\n2015 as a result of the government policy, which had as an objective during this period keeping domestic gasoline \n\nprices lower than their international equivalents.  \n\nThe practiced fuel pricing policy has been an important decision for the Brazilian government, since the \n\ncountry has a history of periods with extremely high inflation. The fact that in Brazil the distribution system of goods \n\nrelies mainly on road transportation implies that higher fuel prices will be passed on to the final price of consumer \n\ngoods, since the majority is transported by trucks. The inadequate infrastructure for using cheaper types of goods \n\ntransportation, such as rail, for instance, makes almost all sectors of the economy vulnerable to fuel price \n\nfluctuations. \n\nCurrently, the final consumer price of petroleum derivatives in Brazil consists of four components: \n\nproducer or importer realization price, costs of biofuel for blending, federal and state taxes, distributor and retailer \n\ntransportation costs and margins (see figure 1). The ex-refinery price of gasoline set by Petrobras constitutes 29% of \n\nthe final consumer price, while for diesel this component accounts for 48% of the final price. As it can be seen on \n\nfigure 1, the tax burden in Brazil for diesel is lower than for gasoline, accounting for 25% and 40% of the final \n\nconsumer fuel price, respectively.  \n\nThe fuel taxes practiced in Brazil include the following federal and state taxes: \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n? Value-Added Tax on Services and Circulation of Goods (ICMS) \u2013 a state tax, calculated using a \n\nweighted average price for the final consumer, which is updated fortnightly. Currently, the value \n\nof this tax is 25% for gasoline for the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, while the average for the entire country \n\nis 25.7% (NPA, 2017).  \n\n? Contribution for Intervention in the Economic Domain (CIDE) - a federal tax, which resembles \n\na contribution on the import and marketing of oil and oil products, as well as ethanol. The \n\nCIDE adjustments are effectively used by the Brazilian government as a tool for offsetting \n\nadjustments in the ex-refinery price of fuels in the country. In 2012, this tax rate reached zero \n\nfor both gasoline and diesel as an attempt to maintain domestic fuel prices at lower levels than \n\ntheir international equivalents. Currently, it is set at 100 R$/cubic meter for gasoline (NPA, \n\n2017). \n\n? Social Integration Program/Public Service Employee Savings Program (PIS/PASEP) \u2013 federal \n\ntaxes, whose rates are charges levied on the gross revenue of companies. Since September, 2016 \n\nthe value of this tax has been set to 67.94 R$/cubic meter for gasoline (NPA, 2017).   \n\n? Contribution to Social Security Funding (Cofins) - a federal tax, levied on the gross revenue of \n\ncompanies. Since September, 2016 it is established at 313.67 R$/cubic meter for gasoline (NPA, \n\n2017).   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Consumer price composition for gasoline C (on the left) and diesel (on the right) in Brazil, referring to March, 2017. \n\nSource: Petrobras. \n\n \n\nIn the United States, the retail prices of gasoline and diesel are not regulated by the government. They are \n\nformed by the supply and demand conditions on the market and follow the fluctuations in the international price of \n\ncrude oil. Fuel prices in the country include four main components: cost of crude oil, refining costs and profits, \n\ntaxes, distribution and marketing costs and profits (see figure 2). The cost of crude oil is the major contributor to the \n\nfinal consumer price of fuels in the U.S., currently accounting for approximately 50% of this price.  \n\nRefining costs and profits vary seasonally and by region in the United States, partly because of the \n\ndifferent gasoline formulations required to reduce air pollution in different parts of the country. Gasoline is more \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nexpensive in the Western States, mainly because of the requirements for cleaner fuel blends in this region due to \n\nconcerns for air quality (EIA, 2016). Moreover, the increased demand for gasoline in the summer months generally \n\nresults in higher prices and, thus, creates demand seasonality. Gasoline prices are also affected by the cost of other \n\ningredients that may be blended with the fuel, such as ethanol.  \n\nFederal, state, and local government taxes also contribute to the retail price of fuels in the U.S. In 2015, \n\nthe federal excise tax on gasoline was 18.34 cents/gallon, while for on-highway diesel it was 24.90 cents/gallon (EIA, \n\n2016). There is an additional Leaking Underground Storage Tank fee of 1 cent/gallon. As of July 1, 2015, state and \n\nlocal government taxes and fees on gasoline averaged 26.49 cents/gallon, while for diesel this amount was 27.24 \n\ncents/gallon (EIA, 2016). County and city taxes can have a significant impact on the price of gasoline in some \n\nlocations, as well.   \n\nIn general, in the United States, the tax burden on diesel has been higher than on gasoline. This trend, \n\nhowever, has been reversed in the beginning of 2017, when the tax burden for both fuels was equalized and \n\naccounted for 20% of the final consumer price as it can be seen on figure 2.  In comparison to Brazil, the tax burden \n\non fuels in the U.S. is almost twice less. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Consumer price composition for gasoline and diesel in the United States, referring to January, 2017. \n\nSource: EIA. \n\n \n\nSimilar to the situation in the U.S., fuel pricing in Germany is not subject to government pricing \n\nregulations. Domestic gasoline and diesel station operators are free to choose at which time, in which direction and \n\nby which amount they change prices for all offered fuel types. The retail fuel market in the country is characterized \n\nby a considerable level of competition, mainly due to the introduction of price comparison websites, such as the \n\nMarket Transparency Unit (Markttransparenzstelle), which publishes fuel prices in real time and ensures higher \n\ntransparency for the final consumer.  \n\nThe majority of fuel retailers in the country charge more than one price a day. Gasoline stations that \n\nbelong to the big brands change their prices more frequently, possibly because they react more quickly to price \n\nadjustments of competitors. In addition, many stations increase prices in the evening hours, which typically remain \n\nvalid during the night, resulting in lower average daytime fuel prices in the country (EIA, 2016). The price varies \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nacross regions, as well, with the South-West and North regions offering the lowest and the South-East region the \n\nhighest average price quotes. \n\nThe fuel price in Germany consists of three components: commodity price, taxes and distributor and \n\nretail margins (see figure 3). The first component depends on the price for the particular product at the port of \n\nRotterdam, which is the main market for fuels in Western Europe, where the benchmark prices of all types of \n\ngasoline and diesel are determined, depending on international market conditions. Since these prices are quoted in \n\nUSD, the EUR/USD exchange rate is of importance for the final fuel price in Germany, as well. Margins in the fuel \n\nretail market in the country are small, accounting for approximately 10% of the final gasoline price.  \n\nThe largest portion of the final consumer price of gasoline and diesel in Germany consists of the tax \n\nburden, which accounts for more than 50% of the retail price. This tax burden includes a fixed energy tax of roughly \n\n0.65 EUR/liter on gasoline and 0.47 EUR/liter on diesel, as well a value-added tax of 19%. In comparison to Brazil \n\nand the U.S., Germany has a much higher tax burden on fuels. In the EU, however, the country does not have the \n\ntoughest fuel tax system. The Netherlands, Italy and Denmark are the top three countries with highest fuel taxes in \n\nEurope (GLOBAL PETRO PRICES, 2017).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3. Consumer price composition for gasoline and diesel in Germany, referring to July, 2016. \n\nSource: MWV. \n\n \n\n2.2.4. Domestic fuel prices  \n\nDifferent government fuel pricing policies and taxation lead to domestic fuel prices that do not always \n\nfollow international crude oil, but rather diverge significantly. The main argument used by governments in order to \n\njustify the use of pricing mechanisms on the domestic fuel market is the fact that oil products tend to have \n\nsignificant negative impact on inflation rates and fuel pricing policies are considered a useful tool for fighting \n\ninflation. In addition, the government policies that influence fuel prices lead to significant divergence of the domestic \n\nprice levels across countries. Figures 4 and 5 illustrates the evolution of gasoline and diesel final consumer prices in \n\nBrazil, Germany and the United States expressed in USD/liter for the period between 2005 and 2016, as well as the \n\ninternational benchmark oil prices \u2013 Europe Brent and OK WTI spot prices.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Monthly average consumer prices of gasoline in Brazil, Germany and the United States \n\nSource: EIA, NPA, MWV. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Monthly average consumer price of diesel in Brazil, Germany and the United States \n\nSource: EIA, NPA, MWV. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nThe graphs show that the prices of both gasoline and diesel were the highest in Germany, followed by \n\nBrazil, and finally the U.S. with the lowest fuel prices among the three countries of interest during the observed \n\nperiod. This fact reflects the difference in the fuel tax burden in the three economies. As mentioned above, in \n\nGermany, the final consumer pays much more in the form of taxes for gasoline and diesel than in Brazil and in the \n\nU.S. In comparison to the rest of the world, the U.S. is among the countries with the lowest gasoline prices, while \n\nGermany ranks in the highest quantile (GLOBAL PETRO PRICES, 2017). Currently, the lowest gasoline price has \n\nbeen observed in Venezuela, while the highest \u2013 in Hong Kong. When it comes to Europe, however, the highest fuel \n\nprices are observed in Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands where gasoline is 25 to 30% more expensive than the \n\nEuropean average (GLOBAL PETRO PRICES, 2017). \n\nThe type of government fuel pricing policy determines the extent to which the fluctuations in the \n\ninternational crude oil price are passed through to the domestic fuel sectors. As discussed above, in Brazil, the ex-\n\nrefinery price of all petroleum derivatives is determined by Petrobras, while in the U.S. and in Germany gasoline and \n\ndiesel prices are formed on the free market and are not subject to government interventions. As it can be seen on \n\nfigures 4 and 5, the prices of both fuels in the U.S. and in Germany appear to fluctuate much more than in Brazil, \n\nespecially when the price of diesel is concerned. This result is not surprising, since in Brazil the international crude oil \n\nprice variations are not absorbed by domestic fuel prices.  \n\n \n\n2.3. Methodology and data description \n\n2.3.1. Stationarity tests \n\nThis study relies on time series techniques for performing the analysis, which requires taking into account \n\nsome general statistical properties of the time series data a priori (SERRA; ZILBERMAN, 2013). The first property \n\nto be considered is the stationarity of the examined variables. Stationary data is characterized by time-constancy of its \n\nstatistical distribution and such a time series is considered to be a process integrated of order zero - I(0). \n\nCommon practices in time series modelling involve the application of the augmented Dickey-Fuller and \n\nthe Phillips-Perron tests for determining whether a data series is stationary or not. The proposed by Elliott, \n\nRothenberg and Stock (1996) DF-GLS test, however, has significantly greater power and better overall performance \n\nin terms of small-sample sizes, dominating the ordinary Dickey-Fuller tests (HATANAKA, 1996). This test \n\nrepresents a modified version of the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, in which the series has been transformed by a \n\ngeneralized least-squares regression. The DF-GLS test is performed fitting a regression of the following form \n\n(ELLIOTT; ROTHENBERG; STOCK, 1996): \n\n?? =  ? + ????? + ?? + ?? ????? + ??????? + ? + ?? ?????  + ??      (2.1) \n\nwhere k is the number of lags of first-differenced, detrended variables. The number of lags of the process \n\nhas to be chosen appropriately. Lags should be added to the model only until they are significant, i.e. until there is no \n\nserial correlation in the error term. For this purpose, information criteria like the Ng-Perron, the Schwarz Criterion \n\nand the Modified Akaike Information Criterion are used. \n\nThere are two forms of the DF-GLS test \u2013 GLS detrending (where the series to be tested is regressed on \n\na constant and a linear trend) and GLS demeaning (where only a constant appears in the first-stage regression). The \n\nnull hypothesis of the DF-GLS test assumes that the process ??  is a random walk. There are two alternative \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nhypotheses depending on the chosen form of the test: ??  is stationary about a linear time trend, and ??  is stationary \n\nwith a possible nonzero mean but with no linear time trend. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. GARCH models \n\nAnother property of time series to be examined in this work is the changing volatility of the studied prices \n\nover time. The most common methodology for analyzing this aspect is the estimation of autoregressive \n\nheteroscedasticity (ARCH) models, which provide insights about the volatility structure of the time series. Contrary \n\nto the existing econometric models that consider the assumption of constant variance, Engle (1982) introduced a \n\nnew class of models with zero mean, no serial correlation, constant unconditional variance, and non-constant \n\nvariance conditional on the past. These are called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes \n\nwhich allow the conditional variance of the process to change over time as a function of past errors, leaving the \n\nunconditional variance unchanged.  \n\nA natural generalization of the ARCH model, which allows for more flexible lag structure, was introduced \n\nby Bollerslev (1986) and is referred to as a GARCH process. Considering a real-valued discrete-time stochastic \n\nprocess ?? and an information set available at time t (? ? ), the GARCH (p,q) process defined by Bollerslev is given by: \n\n??|? ??? ? ? (0,?? )     (2.2) \n\n?? =  ?? + ? ?? ????\n?\n\n?\n\n?? ?\n\n+  ? ?? ????\n\n?\n\n?? ?\n\n \n\n= ?? + ?(?)??\n? + ?(?)??    (2.3) \n\nwhere ? ? 0,? > 0,?? > 0,?? ? 0 (?= 1,\u2026 ,?),?? ? 0 (?= 1,\u2026 ,?). If ? = 0, the GARCH (p,q) \n\nreduces to an ARCH (q) process, and if both p and q are zero, ?? is just a white noise process. The main difference \n\nbetween the ARCH and the GARCH models is that the former considers the conditional variance as a linear \n\nfunction of past sample errors, while the latter allows the addition of the lagged conditional variances, as well. \n\nThe above presented model considers the volatility of a single time series variable. The multivariate \n\nGARCH models represent an extension of the univariate GARCH to an n-variable case, where ??  is the (n x n) \n\nconditional variance-covariance matrix of the n-dimensional zero mean random variable ??. This matrix is a function \n\nof the information set ? ???, which allows each element of the matrix to depend on q lagged values of the squared \n\nand cross-products of ??, as well as on p lagged values of the elements of ?? . MGARCH models allow the \n\nconditional variance-covariance matrix of the dependent variables to follow a flexible dynamic structure and the \n\nconditional mean to follow a vector autoregression (VAR) process. The main advantage of this model is that it \n\nallows for the study of the relationships between the volatilities of multiple time series.  \n\nIn general, MGARCH models differ depending on the specification of the conditional covariance \n\nfunction, each of them having its own characteristics and limitations. The focus of this work is the dynamic \n\nconditional correlations model (DCC) developed by Engle (2002), which is based on the decomposition of the \n\nmatrix ?? . More specifically, for the process ?? |? ??? ? ? (0,?? ), this matrix can be written as: \n\n?? =  ?? ????    (2.4) \n\nwhere ?  is the correlation matrix containing the conditional correlations and ??  is a diagonal matrix \n\ncontaining the standard deviations of the process, i.e. ??  consists of the ? ???  elements on its main diagonal. The \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nDCC model allows for the ?  matrix to be time-varying. Moreover, the conditional variances can be modelled as \n\nunivariate GARCH processes and the conditional correlations as functions of past market shocks.  \n\nEngle (2002) starts with considering the conditional correlation between two random variables ???  and ???  \n\nas given by: \n\n???,? =\n??? ?(??,???,?)\n\n? ??? ?(??,?\n? )??? ?(??,?\n\n? )\n   (2.5) \n\nThe returns ??  can be rewritten as the conditional standard deviation (? ??,? = ? ????(??,?\n? )) multiplied by \n\nthe standardized disturbances ??, which have zero mean and variance equal to one for each series, in the following \n\nway: \n\n??,? = ? ??,? ??,?    (2.6) \n\nFurthermore, Engle defines the conditional covariance matrix of returns as ????(?? ??\n?) ? ?? , where ??  \n\ncan be decomposed as in Equation (2.4). The correlation matrix ??  consists of all the equations in (2.6). In order to \n\nobtain this matrix, the ???,? \u2019 s have to be estimated. The author suggests the following correlation estimator: \n\n???,? =\n???,?\n\n? ???,????,?\n   (2.7) \n\nwhere the q\u2019s are modelled as univariate GARCH processes in the following fashion (with ????  being the \n\nunconditional correlation between the two random variables): \n\n???,? = ???? + ????,?????,??? ? ???? ? + ?(???,??? ? ???? )   (2.8) \n\nEngle assumes that the average of ???,?  will be ????  and the average variance will be one. Moreover, the \n\ncorrelation estimator given by equation (2.8) will be positive definite as long as the covariance matrix ? ? , which \n\nconsists of the elements ???,? , is a weighted average of positive definite and semidefinite matrices. To ensure the \n\npositive definiteness of ? ? , the condition ? + ? &lt;1 must hold. The estimation of the developed MGARCH-DCC \n\nmodel, as proposed by Engle, relies on maximum likelihood techniques.  \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Data description \n\nThe data used in this paper consists of the following price series: \n\n? Common gasoline monthly average price, resale, Brazil, BRL/liter (NPA); \n\n? Diesel monthly average price, resale, Brazil, BRL/liter (NPA); \n\n? Regular motor gasoline, all areas, retail price, U.S., USD/gallon (EIA); \n\n? On-Highway diesel fuel price, including taxes, U.S., USD/gallon (EIA); \n\n? Gasoline Super 95 E5 consumer price, Germany, EUR cents/liter (MWV); \n\n? Diesel consumer price, Germany, EUR cents/liter (MWV); \n\n? Europe Brent spot price, fob, USD/barrel (EIA); \n\n? OK WTI spot price, fob, USD/barrel (EIA). \n\nAll data series were obtained from secondary sources and refer to monthly average consumer prices for \n\nthe period July, 2005 - November, 2016. After 2005, biofuels started gaining considerable importance worldwide, \n\nwhich makes the chosen period of study rather relevant. According to Silveira and Mattos (2015), the increased \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nglobal production and consumption after 2005 of biofuels altered the relationship between domestic fuel prices and \n\ncrude oil. Moreover, the analysis is performed using consumer prices, in order to account for the combined effects \n\nof both government pricing policies (which have a direct impact on the ex-refinery price of fuels) and taxation \n\n(which impacts the final consumer price of fuels). The price of Europe Brent was used for the estimation of the \n\nmodels for Brazil and Germany, while for the U.S. the WTI oil price was included in the estimated system of prices.  \n\nIn order to make the data comparable for the purposes of the study, all fuel prices were converted to \n\nUSD/liter, using the monthly average BRL/USD and EUR/USD exchange rates published by OECD. All variables \n\nwere transformed into log differences in order to work with price returns.  \n\n \n\n2.4. Results \n\n2.4.1. Stationarity test \n\nPrior to performing the analysis, the data series were tested for stationarity using the DF-GLS test. Both \n\nvariations of the test were applied and the obtained results are reported in panel A., table 1. The number of lags was \n\nchosen using the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). All variables were found to be nonstationary in log form and \n\nstationary in log differences. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

MGARCH-DCC estimation results \n\nThe MGARCH-DCC (1,1) model was employed for calculating the time-varying conditional covariance \n\nmatrix for the system of gasoline, diesel and crude oil prices in Brazil, in the United States, and in Germany. The \n\nresulting estimated coefficients of the MGARCH models for each country are plotted in tables 2, 3, and 4, \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nrespectively. The performed Wald test for the mutual significance of the adjustment parameters for the variance \n\nrejects the null hypothesis that ?? = ?? = 0 at all conventional levels for the three countries of interest, thus, \n\nsuggesting that the DCC model fits better the data than the constant conditional correlation MGARCH model.  \n\nFor Brazil, a heteroscedastic model with just an ARCH term was estimated, since the results of the \n\nperformed standard likelihood ratio test gave a rejection of the model containing both ARCH and GARCH terms. \n\nAs it can be seen in table 2, the ARCH term is significant for the three variables of interest, indicating that the \n\nvariance of the price returns of gasoline, diesel and oil is affected by past error terms. The estimated conditional \n\nquasi-correlations are all positive, which implies that when the volatility of one variable increases, this leads to higher \n\nvolatility in the other variables in the system. Gasoline and diesel prices were found to have a correlation of \n\napproximately 0.94, indicating that the two prices are highly related, while oil was found to be more correlated to the \n\nprice of diesel than to the price of gasoline.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.

Standard errors in brackets.  \n \n\nFigure 6 plots the estimated dynamic volatilities of the three price series for Brazil, which showed strong \n\ntime-varying behavior during the analyzed period. As it can be observed on the graph, the price of oil was much \n\nmore volatile than the consumer prices of diesel and gasoline in the country. During the global financial crisis of \n\n2008, the volatility of oil registered a significant jump, reaching historically high values. It returned considerably fast \n\nto its previous levels in the beginning of 2009. Moreover, after January, 2015, when the international price of oil fell \n\nto record low levels for the first time after the financial crisis, its price became much more volatile.  \n\n The volatility of domestic gasoline and diesel prices, on the other hand, remained rather stable during the \n\nobserved period. It increased as well during the crisis years, but this response was rather small in comparison to \n\ninternational crude oil, thus, indicating that the artificially established fuel prices in Brazil did not allow international \n\ncrude oil price volatility to be transmitted to the domestic fuel market. This result confirms the findings of Ara\u00fajo \n\n(2006), who showed that domestic fuel prices in Brazil did not follow international crude oil price volatility between \n\n2002 and 2006. \n\nFigure 7 plots the estimated correlations between the fuel sector in Brazil and international crude oil, \n\nwhich showed strong time-varying behavior. The dynamic correlation between gasoline and diesel was found to be \n\nrather high, remaining in the range of 0.8-1.0 during the entire analyzed period, with the following few exceptions: in \n\nthe end of 2008, as a result of the global financial crisis; in the beginning of 2011 - a period characterized by high \n\ninternational commodity prices and ethanol crisis in Brazil; in the end of 2013, when Petrobras started a wave of \n\nadjustments of the ex-refinery prices of both gasoline and diesel, and set the CIDE on fuels to zero in 2012. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n The estimated oil-gasoline and oil-diesel dynamic correlations were found to move together and to vary \n\nsignificantly during the observed period. Both correlations were lower in the beginning of the period, registered an \n\nincrease after the global financial crisis and showed more variation after October, 2014. This trend can be associated \n\nwith the significant drop in international oil prices in the beginning of 2015, while Brazilian fuel prices were kept at \n\nthe same levels and did not follow the decreasing international trend.  \n\nIt is interesting to observe that the correlation between oil and the two fuels of interest in Brazil turned \n\nnegative twice during the observed period \u2013 once in the end of 2015, and a second time in the first quarter of 2016. \n\nThe main reason for this lies in the falling trend in the international crude oil price during these periods, while in \n\nBrazil domestic fuel prices were kept at levels higher than their international equivalents. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Estimated dynamic volatilities for Brazil  \n\nSource: Results of the research. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 7. Estimated dynamic correlations for Brazil \n\nSource: Results of the research. \n\n \n\nThe estimated MGARCH-DCC model for the United States results in significant ARCH and GARCH \n\nterms for all variables in the system, indicating that all variances are affected by both past error terms and past \n\nvariances. The positive and significant GARCH terms imply that positive shocks increase volatility. The adjustment \n\ncoefficients of the variance (?? and  ??) were found to be jointly different than zero, indicating that the variance of \n\nthe variables is dynamic. All estimated correlations are positive and high \u2013 above 0.7, while for Brazil, the \n\ncorrelations between oil and the domestic fuel price returns were found to be less than 0.5, thus, indicating the \n\ninfluence of the government intervention in the domestic fuel price formation process. In addition, the price returns \n\nof oil and diesel in the U.S. appear to be more correlated than of gasoline and oil, which is a result similar to the one \n\nobserved for Brazil. The domestic price returns of the two fuels of interest have the highest correlation among the \n\nthree price pairs, with estimated value equal to 0.83.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Standard errors in brackets. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nThe graphs on figures 8 and 9 plot the estimated dynamic volatilities and correlations of the price series \n\nfor the United States. Although the volatility of the diesel price returns was the lowest among the three variables, it is \n\nnoticeable that the volatilities of the three prices moved together during the observed period and exhibited strong \n\nvariation. This result is rather different than what was observed in Brazil, indicating how fuel pricing policies can \n\nalter the relationship between domestic fuel prices and the international oil market.  \n\nMoreover, the jump in the volatility of the price of oil in the end of 2008 was accompanied by a \n\nsignificant increase in the volatility of the U.S. fuel prices, with gasoline having an even stronger response than the \n\nprice of oil. This result is similar to the findings of Rahman (2016), according to which, the growing international \n\ncrude oil price volatility led to higher volatility of U.S. gasoline prices after the crisis years. In the end of the analyzed \n\nperiod, as a result of the turbulence on the international crude oil market due to the falling oil prices, the volatility of \n\nthe three price series went up and registered much more variation than between 2010 and 2015, indicating the high \n\nresponsiveness of the domestic fuel prices in the U.S. to fluctuations on the international oil market.  \n\nFigure 9 shows the estimated dynamic correlations between the examined prices for the U.S. market. The \n\ncorrelations between the international crude oil price returns and the domestic fuels for this country are higher than \n\nthe calculated for the Brazilian market. They remained positive during the entire analyzed period - in the range of 0.6 \n\nand 0.8. The estimated dynamic correlation between the gasoline and diesel price returns was the highest among the \n\nthree price pairs, which is in line with what was found for the Brazilian fuel market. For the U.S., however, this \n\ncorrelation remained in the range of 0.7 and 0.9, which is lower than the calculated for Brazil. \n\nIn the beginning of the analyzed period all estimated dynamic correlations were found to experience a \n\nsignificant jump. This result can be attributed to the fact that the American fuel sector went through some important \n\nchanges at this point in time. The MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether) was banned as an additive to gasoline in \n\n2004, the Energy Policy Act and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS1) were implemented in 2005, and a number of \n\nbiofuel government policies, such as blending mandates, tax benefits and subsidies for biofuel production, were \n\nintroduced by the government. All these measures stimulated the production and use of ethanol in the country after \n\n2005 and helped the U.S. become the major player on the international biofuel scene, surpassing Brazil in terms of \n\nproduction and consumption.  \n\nThe increased participation of ethanol in the energy mix in the U.S. altered the conditions on the \n\ndomestic fuel market and can be associated with the significant jump in the oil-fuel correlation observed at the same \n\nperiod. Such an increase in the correlation, on the other hand, was not observed in Brazil in the end of 2005. The \n\ncountry went through a significant structural change of its domestic fuel sector earlier than the U.S. \u2013 in 2003, with \n\nthe introduction of the flex-fuel vehicle which allowed the use of pure ethanol as a substitute to conventional fossil \n\nfuels.  \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8.

The positive and significant GARCH terms show that positive \n\nshocks led to higher volatility of the three examined prices. The quasi-correlations are positive and higher than the \n\nestimated equivalents for Brazil and the U.S. Gasoline and diesel were found to have the highest correlation, while \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\ndiesel and oil are more correlated than oil and gasoline, which can be attributed to the importance that this type of \n\nfuel has for Germany.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.

Standard errors in brackets. \n\n \nFigure 10 plots the estimated dynamic volatilities of the variables, showing that the domestic prices of \n\ngasoline and diesel exhibited stable and rather low volatility during the observed period, with small and almost \n\ninsignificant adjustments in the end of 2008 and in the beginning of 2015 - the two major turbulent periods for the \n\ninternational crude oil price.  \n\nAs it can be seen on the graph, the price of crude oil was much more volatile than the German diesel and \n\ngasoline price returns \u2013 a result in line with the one obtained for Brazil, but rather different than what was observed \n\nfor the U.S. This indicates that free fuel pricing policy does not necessarily allow domestic fuel prices to follow the \n\nvolatility of the international crude oil price. As discussed above, even in a situation when domestic fuel prices are \n\nformed on the market, governments can still influence the fuel sector through taxation mechanisms. Fuel tax burden \n\nin Germany constitutes more than 50% of the final consumer price of fuels, while the cost of crude oil accounts for \n\nonly 25%, which can explain the rather stable price volatility of diesel and gasoline in the country. Thus, using \n\nflexible taxation on fuels, the government is able to stabilize the domestic fuel price without letting the international \n\ncrude oil price fluctuations distort the domestic fuel sector.  \n\nWhen it comes to the estimated dynamic correlations between the variables, the results plotted on Figure \n\n11 show that the correlation between gasoline and diesel is the highest among the three price pairs, which is in line \n\nwith the results obtained for Brazil and the U.S. As it was found for the U.S., the correlation between the variables in \n\nGermany increased significantly in the beginning of the observed period, which can be attributed to the growing \n\nimportance of the use of biofuels around the world after 2005. In Germany, in particular, there was a boom in \n\nbiodiesel production after 2005, which reached record levels in 2007. Moreover, the German government started \n\nstimulating the use of biofuels in 2004 with the introduction of a new tax policy, which allowed full tax exemption \n\nfor biofuels blended with conventional fuels.  \n\n The estimated correlations for Germany, however, remained rather stable after 2006 \u2013 in the range of \n\napproximately 0.75 and 0.9 - without registering any significant jumps during the crisis years. This result differs \n\nsignificantly from what was found for Brazil and the U.S., where the calculated correlations exhibit significant time-\n\nvarying behavior. This result implies that different characteristics of the domestic fuel market together with different \n\ngovernment policies and taxation alter the relationship between domestic fuel prices and the international crude oil \n\nmarket. In particular, taxation in Germany is rather different than in the other two examined countries. The heavy \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\ntax burden on fuel prices practiced by the German government is an instrument that helps keeping the domestic fuel \n\nsector rather stable. This result is in line with the existing literature, since, in general, Germany is considered a \n\ncountry that is not negatively influenced by the high volatility of international oil prices and one of the countries with \n\nthe lowest oil vulnerability index (GUPTA, 2008).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 10. Estimated dynamic volatilities for Germany \n\nSource: Results of the research. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 11. Estimated dynamic correlations for Germany \n\nSource: Results of the research. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nGermany is an example of a country where the fuel pricing policy of the government and the taxation \n\nregarding fuels work in a consensus. On the one hand, the free ex-refinery prices of fuels that are formed on the \n\nmarket and follow international crude oil price fluctuations induce competitiveness to the domestic fuel sector, while, \n\non the other hand, the practiced fiscal policy on fuels keeps the final consumer price stable. The situation in the \n\ncountry should serve as an example for policy makers in Brazil, where the government attempts to diminish the \n\nnegative effects of international crude oil price fluctuations on the domestic economy by establishing the ex-refinery \n\nprice of all petroleum derivatives, while the practiced fiscal policy on fuels remains rather inadequate. Even though \n\nthe original idea behind the flat-rate fuel tax CIDE was to be a flexible tool for stabilizing the domestic fuel sector, it \n\nwas not implemented appropriately and currently the CIDE serves mainly as an additional instrument of the \n\ngovernment for inducing disparity between domestic fuel prices and their international equivalents. Thus, the main \n\nnegative aspect regarding the practiced policy in Brazil can be related to the lack of consensus between the two \n\ninstruments in the hands of the government \u2013 fuel pricing policy and taxation. \n\n \n\n2.6. Conclusions \n\nThis study focuses on a comparative analysis between the fossil fuel sectors in Brazil, in the United States \n\nand in Germany, with an emphasis on the evolution of the volatilities of domestic fuel prices and their correlation \n\nwith international crude oil. A multivariate GARCH-DCC model was estimated for each of the three countries, using \n\nmonthly average consumer prices of gasoline and diesel in addition to the WTI and the Europe Brent crude oil \n\nprices for the period July, 2005 - November, 2016.  \n\nThe three examined countries differ significantly when it comes to specific characteristics of the domestic \n\nfuel sectors and government fuel pricing policy and taxation. These differences are behind the distinct estimated \n\ndynamic volatilities of the domestic fuel prices and their correlations with international crude oil in the three \n\ncountries of interest.  \n\nThe obtained price volatilities show that domestic fuel prices in Brazil and in Germany are not as volatile \n\nas the price of crude oil and do not accompany the variations in the volatility of the latter, while for the United States \n\ndomestic fuel price volatilities were found to exhibit significant fluctuations similar to the international crude oil \n\nprice. This results are in line with the existing differences between the three examined countries. In Brazil, the \n\ngovernment fuel pricing policy does not allow the domestic price of fuels to adjust towards the fluctuations of crude \n\noil, while in Germany the practiced taxation smooths out the volatility of domestic gasoline and diesel prices.  \n\nMoreover, the estimated dynamic correlations between crude oil and domestic gasoline and diesel prices \n\nin the U.S. and in Germany are almost double the correlations obtained for Brazil, which were found to be less than \n\n0.5 for almost the entire analyzed period. This result is in line with the specific fuel pricing policy in Brazil, where the \n\ngovernment does not allow the domestic prices to adjust to international crude oil price fluctuations. \n\nAlthough the estimated correlations for Brazil and the U.S. show significant time-varying behavior, such a \n\nresult was not found for the German fuel market, where the oil-gasoline and the oil-diesel correlations remained \n\nrather stable during the entire analyzed period. This finding indicates that the practiced policy in Germany, which is a \n\ncombination of market fuel prices and flexible fiscal policy, permits the domestic fuel sector to be competitive, \n\nhaving prices that follow supply and demand conditions on the market, while at the same time, final consumer prices \n\nof fuels remain rather stable without inducing unnecessary instability to the domestic economy.  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nThe results of this paper are important for policy makers, since they provide empirical evidence that \n\ndifferent government fuel pricing policies and taxation alter the correlation between domestic fuel prices and \n\ninternational crude oil. Artificially established by the government ex-refinery prices of petroleum derivatives, lead to \n\nlower correlation between domestic fuel prices and oil in comparison to countries where the government does not \n\nintervene in the formation of domestic fuel prices. This pricing policy, however, without an adequate fiscal policy on \n\nfuels, can lead to negative consequences for the domestic fuel sector and the entire economy, as observed in Brazil.  \n\nThe country is in need of a policy reform that considers not only the formation of petroleum derivatives\u2019 prices, but \n\nalso adequate taxation on fuels, such as the one practiced in Germany, that protects the domestic economy from the \n\nfluctuations in the international crude oil price.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nARA\u00daJO, T.J.

PRICE TRANSMISSION IN THE BIOFUEL-RELATED SECTORS \u2013 A \n\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN BRAZIL, GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES  \n\nABSTRACT \n\n The main objective of the present study is to verify if there exist differences in the biofuel-\nrelated price transmission mechanisms in Brazil, in the United States and in Germany for the period \n2005 \u2013 2016, accounting for the effects of the global crisis of 2008. The performed time series analysis \nfocuses on using data with the same frequency, level and time frame for the three economies in order \nto complement the existing literature with a comparative analysis of the relationships between the \nbiofuel prices, their main fuel alternative and their major feedstock. The obtained results show that the \nGerman biofuel industry stands out among the three countries, especially when it comes to price \ntransmission. While in Brazil and in the U.S. the ethanol sectors are characterized by a stable \nrelationship between the prices of the biofuel-related commodities, in Germany such a strong and \npermanent link between biodiesel, diesel and rapeseed oil is not observed. Moreover, the results for \nthe two sub-periods show that the price transmission changed significantly after the financial crisis. \nThe three examined price series for Brazil and the U.S. became more integrated after 2008. The price \nof corn, however, remained exogenous during both sub-periods, implying that the relationship \nbetween the main feedstock and the domestic biofuel sector in the U.S. is rather different than the \nexisting in Brazil. In Germany, on the other hand, the transmission between the three price series \ndisappeared after the crisis period, which can be attributed to the changes in the policy regarding \nbiofuels in the country, as well as to the specific characteristics of its biofuel-related sectors. \n\nKeywords: Biofuels; Price transmission; Comparative analysis; VECM \n\n \n\n3.1. INTRODUCTION \n\nIn recent years, rising fuel prices and growing environmental concerns about the harmful effects of \n\nconventional energy sources on global climate were the main drivers of the increased interest in biofuels as a \n\nsubstitute for fossil fuels in transportation. The growing production of this type of fuel alternative has changed the \n\nrelationship between agricultural commodity prices and energy markets. According to Peri and Baldi (2010), higher \n\nenergy prices stimulate biofuel production, which in turn leads to higher demand for agricultural crops used as \n\nfeedstock for this fuel alternative, resulting in rising agricultural commodity prices. The potential existence of such a \n\nrelationship between energy, biofuels and agricultural commodity markets makes the research on this topic highly \n\nrelevant, especially considering the recent trends on international oil and agricultural commodity markets.  \n\nCrude oil prices reached historically high levels in 2008 as a result of the global financial crisis, which was \n\nfollowed by a dramatic drop in 2009. International agricultural commodity prices, on the other hand, exhibited \n\nsignificant increase after 2011 accompanied by considerable volatility, which raised the question if biofuels are to \n\nblame for this rising trend on the international agricultural market. Moreover, the recent trend of cheap crude oil that \n\nstarted in the beginning of 2015 affected biofuels, threatening the production of this commodity and making it less \n\ncompetitive as a substitute to conventional fossil fuels. Thus, the way these trends on the international market altered \n\nthe existing price transmission mechanism between fuel, biofuel and agricultural commodity markets has become a \n\nwidely discussed topic by energy, environmental and agricultural economists and has been examined thoroughly in \n\nthe existing literature. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nA better understanding of the fuels-biofuels-agricultural commodity price relationship is of particular \n\nimportance for policy makers, since it directly influences the impact that energy and agricultural government policies \n\nwould have on the domestic economy. Such an understanding of price relationships, can shed light on the currently \n\npopular food versus fuel debate raised by environmental groups criticizing biofuel stimulation policies. \n\nComprehending the price dynamics among biofuel-related markets provides insights about the actual existence of a \n\nhazard for food security due to increased biofuel production. Moreover, knowledge of price transmission is crucial \n\nfor many other economic agents as well, such as market operators and traders, agricultural producers, fuel and \n\nbiofuel refiners, since it can affect their decisions to produce, invest and adopt mechanisms for protecting their \n\nproduction from price risks.  \n\nThe interrelations among energy, biofuels and agricultural commodities are present mainly in the \n\ncountries engaged in biofuel production and consumption, such as Brazil, the United States and some European \n\ncountries, like Germany. The U.S. is currently the leading producer of biofuels in the world, focusing on ethanol \n\nderived from corn, which is used for blending with conventional gasoline in low percentages (from 5 to 15%).  \n\nBrazil is the second biggest global producer of ethanol and is one of the few countries in the world where \n\nethanol and gasoline act as substitutes, since the wide use of flex-fuel vehicles allows the final consumer to choose \n\nbetween these two fuel alternatives. The use of sugarcane as main feedstock for the production of biofuels makes \n\nethanol and sugar competitors on the supply side. Thus, there exists a specific relationship between the biofuel-\n\nrelated markets in Brazil, which cannot be observed anywhere else.  \n\nGermany is the major producers and consumer of biofuels in the European Union and a global leader in \n\nthe production of biodiesel, which is derived mainly form rapeseed oil and is available as a blend with conventional \n\ndiesel and in a pure form as a substitute. The country has a pioneering role in the promotion of biofuels and the \n\nadopted government policies stimulating the sector have served as an example for other EU member countries.  \n\nThe three countries of interest exhibit significant differences when it comes to market specifications and \n\ngovernment policies regarding biofuels. Thus, it is expected that the price transmission mechanisms in the domestic \n\nbiofuel-related sectors in the three economies differ significantly as a result of the varying policies and market \n\ninstruments. According to Kristoufek, Janda and Zilberman (2013): \u201ca shock on the price of ethanol in Brazil may differ \n\nconsiderably from a shock on the ethanol price in the U.S., and there may be a stronger link between biodiesel and fossil fuel prices in \n\nGermany that is greater than one would expect if considering fossil fuels and biofuels generically.\u201d  \n\nThe present work aims at performing a comparative analysis between the biofuel-related price \n\ntransmission in Brazil, the U.S. and Germany, using the same methodology and data types in order to provide \n\ninsights related to the argument of Kristoufek, Janda and Zilberman (2013). The main focus of the study is the \n\nexamination of the linkages between the prices of the two most popular biofuels - ethanol and biodiesel, on the one \n\nhand, and the related to them feedstock and conventional fossil fuel prices, on the other. Emphasis is put on the \n\npossible causes for the identified differences among the three developed price transmission models, such as specific \n\ncharacteristics of the biofuel and fuel sectors and varying government policies. \n\nThe main contribution of this work is the fact that the analysis is not restricted to one particular country, \n\nbut rather has an emphasis the comparison between the results obtained for the three chosen economies. Such a \n\ncomparison can shed light on the impact that different policies and market instruments have on biofuel-related price \n\ntransmission mechanisms and can provide knowledge and better understanding of the reasons underlying the \n\npossible divergence in the obtained results for the three examined countries. The findings could be particularly useful \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nfor policy makers, since the impacts of policy regimes can become clearer after comparing the situation across \n\ncountries, and could help for the better understanding of how biofuel markets function under specific conditions. \n\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows: Section 3.2 briefly reviews the related literature on \n\nbiofuel price transmission; Section 3.3 presents the methodology used for performing the analysis; Section 3.4 \n\ndescribes the data used for the estimation; Section 3.5 is devoted to the result of the analysis; and, finally, Section 3.6 \n\nconcludes with final remarks and suggestions for future research. \n\n \n\n3.2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n3.2.1. Price transmission literature \u2013 an overview \n\nBefore biofuels gained the importance they have nowadays, the majority of the research on price \n\ntransmission in energy markets was focused on the interrelationships between fuel and agricultural commodity \n\nprices. The increased use of biofuels that served as an incentive for policy interventions, however, introduced this \n\nnew factor that has an impact on agricultural markets. The price increase of agricultural commodities after 2011 \n\nraised the concern about the potential negative effects that biofuels have on the price levels and the volatility of these \n\ncommodities. That is why most of the research in the area is focused on examining the price relationships between \n\nfeedstock and food, on the one hand, and energy and bioenergy, on the other.  \n\nThe existing studies on the presence and the direction of price relationships between the energy and \n\nagricultural markets usually differ in several aspects. First of all, the literature consists of both theoretical and time-\n\nseries methodology, both having its advantages and disadvantages. The former has been developed using partial and \n\ngeneral equilibrium models in order to analyze price level patterns, but not price volatility. These models, however, \n\nhave been criticized for not being validated by historical data (SERRA; ZILBERMAN, 2013). Time-series analysis, \n\non the other hand, is considered to be a relevant instrument for examining price transmission both in level and in \n\nvolatility. Nevertheless, according to Abbott (2012) and Headey and Fan (2010) the results of time-series analysis \n\nhave been rather inconclusive when it comes to the impact that biofuels have on agricultural commodity prices. The \n\nmost common time-series methodology in the literature relies on cointegration and Granger causality tests, \n\nestimation of vector autoregression (VAR) and vector error-correction models (VECM).  \n\nSecond of all, the data used in the econometric studies differs significantly across papers. The sources \n\nvary, as well as the period and the frequency of the data. Some authors examine the relationship between spot prices, \n\nothers focus on futures prices. Some studies include only domestic prices, others incorporate international prices, as \n\nwell. These differences in the literature justify the lack of consensus about the examined price relationships, and, in \n\naddition, do not allow the comparison of the obtained results across countries and regions.  \n\nThe main conclusion in the majority of the existing studies is that biofuel and fuel price levels are strongly \n\nconnected to agricultural commodity prices. Furthermore, a number of authors (GORTER; DRABIK; JUST, 2013) \n\nargue that price linkages depend significantly on the specific country that is being examined, on the agricultural \n\ndevelopment in this country, on the existing government supporting policies, and on the type of examined \n\nagricultural commodities.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Brazil \n\nThe case of Brazil is particularly interesting when it comes to price interrelations among the biofuel-\n\nrelated sectors. This is the result of a number of specific factors that play a role simultaneously: Brazil has a long \n\nhistory and experience in the biofuel industry; the country is one of the main producers and consumers of ethanol \n\nworldwide; biofuels are used as a substitute for gasoline and compete with sugar on the supply side. The price \n\ntransmission literature in Brazil emerged after the liberalization of the sugarcane and ethanol sectors in the early \n\n2000s. Till then the analysis of price linkages was inapplicable, since the government was administrating the prices of \n\nboth sugar and ethanol.  \n\nIn their review of biofuel-related price transmission literature, Serra and Zilberman (2013) point out two \n\narticles that study this price relationship in Brazil \u2013 Rapsomanikis and Hallam (2006) and Balcombe and \n\nRapsomanikis (2008). The former suggests that international oil prices drive domestic sugar and ethanol prices in the \n\nlong-run in an asymmetric manner, while there is no evidence for nonlinearity in the price transmission between \n\nsugar and ethanol, where sugar is found to be the dominant commodity. Balcombe and Rapsomanikis (2008), on the \n\nother hand, find evidence that international oil prices drive long-run domestic sugar prices, which in turn Granger-\n\ncause domestic ethanol prices.  \n\nLong-term relationship between ethanol and sugar and ethanol and gasoline is found by Rodrigues (2009), \n\nwhile Block, Coronel and Veloso (2012) provide evidence for the existence of a strong linkage between sugarcane, \n\nsugar and hydrous ethanol prices with the latter being the leader. Bentivoglio, Finco and Bacchi (2016), on the other \n\nhand, find a cointegration relation between the ethanol, sugar and gasoline prices in the country and show that in the \n\nshort-run sugar and gasoline prices drive the main biofuel, while the latter has limited power in influencing the prices \n\nof the other two commodities.  \n\nMoreover, Capitani (2014) analyzes the price transmission between the Brazilian ethanol industry and a \n\nnumber of agricultural commodities for the period 2004-2014. The results show that sugarcane and ethanol do not \n\nhave any significant negative effects on agricultural commodity prices. Therefore, according to the author, the \n\nincreased production of biofuels in the country in recent years has had low influence on crop markets, which is in \n\nline with the results of Balcombe and Rapsomanikis (2008).  \n\nChen and Shaghaian (2015) investigate the linkages among the price of ethanol in Brazil and the \n\ninternational prices of sugar and oil, accounting for structural breaks. According to the authors, before the crisis of \n\n2008 there was only a short-term relationship among the price series, while after the breaking point they find \n\nevidence for cointegration between the three price series. Oil remained exogenous during the analyzed period, \n\naffecting significantly domestic ethanol and international sugar prices.  \n\nSome authors focus mainly on the relationship between fuel and biofuel markets in Brazil, without \n\nconsidering the effects they have on agricultural and feedstock markets. Cavalcanti, Szklo and Machado (2011), for \n\ninstance, find that there is no effective price relationship between gasoline and international crude oil, while a long-\n\nterm linkage exists between hydrous ethanol and gasoline in Brazil. \n\nAlthough a large number of studies focus on cointegration tests and estimation of VECM, some authors \n\nturn to different models for performing their analysis on price transmission. Nunez and Otero (2015) examine \n\nBrazilian gasoline and ethanol prices, applying a pairwise procedure, which allows for the study of the spatial \n\nintegration within and between the price series. The main findings suggest that the speed of adjustment of fuel and \n\nbiofuel prices in the long-run depends on the distance between the States and on the tax regimes.  \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nAs it can be seen from this brief review of the literature on price transmission among the Brazilian \n\nbiofuel-related markets, the majority of the findings suggest the existence of a long-term relationship between \n\nethanol and sugar prices, and between ethanol and gasoline, but there is no consensus on the direction of the existing \n\nlinkages.  \n\n \n\n3.2.3. United States \n\nThe majority of the works studying the topic of interest for the United States focus on the price \n\ntransmission between biofuels and agricultural commodities. The main reasons for this trend is the fact that \n\nincreasing food prices in the country have raised concerns about the negative impact that the high biofuel production \n\nhas on agricultural commodity and food prices. A lot of works have been devoted to finding evidence in support or \n\nagainst the hypothesis that the stimulation of ethanol production after 2005 has something to do with the recent \n\nagricultural and food commodity price increase.  \n\nZhang et al. (2009) use weekly prices for U.S. ethanol, corn, soybeans, gasoline and oil and conclude that \n\nalthough biofuels do not impact agricultural commodities in the long-run, they have a short-term negative impact on \n\nfood prices. Moreover, Zhang et al. (2010) find no direct long-run relationship and only limited short-run linkages \n\nbetween agricultural and energy prices in the U.S. prior to 2008. The authors conclude that rising fuel prices are not \n\ndirectly leading to more expensive agricultural commodities, while sugar appears to be the driving force for the \n\nshort-term increase in agricultural prices. When it comes to analyzing short-term effects, Cha and Bae (2011) find \n\nevidence that international oil price increases lead to elevated demand for corn for the production of ethanol in the \n\nU.S. and from there to higher corn prices in the country in the short-run.  \n\nMerkusheva and Rapsomanikis (2014) examine the price relationship between oil, ethanol, corn, wheat, \n\nand rice in the U.S. and show that oil prices are the long-run driver of ethanol and agricultural commodities. On the \n\nother hand, in the short-run the relationship between fuel and grain markets appears to be much weaker, which, \n\naccording to the authors, is a result of external factors such as the biofuel mandate.  \n\nAlthough the main focus of researchers is spot price links, futures price relationships have been examined \n\nin the existing literature, as well. Papiez (2014), for instance, analyzes the causality among corn, crude oil and ethanol \n\nfutures prices on NYMEX and CBOT. The obtained results suggest that causality relationships among these three \n\nprice series change over time: corn prices influence crude oil futures prices till 2010 and ethanol till 2013, while oil \n\nprices have an impact on corn and ethanol only till 2010.  \n\nMyers et al. (2014) investigate the long- and short-run co-movements between U.S. fuel and agricultural \n\ncommodity spot prices, while Myers et al. (2015) focus on analyzing the same relationship but using futures prices. \n\nThese two works show that there is less co-movement between the futures prices of oil and feedstock used for \n\nbiofuels than between the spot prices of these commodities \u2013 a rather important results, since it does not support the \n\nhypothesis that the excessive speculation on futures markets leads to tighter price links. \n\nA number of researchers focus their attention on the impact that biofuel policies have on the price \n\ntransmission mechanism. Baumeister and Kilion (2013), for instance, examine the price links for the U.S. accounting \n\nfor a structural break in 2006 when the country expanded dramatically its ethanol production. The authors find no \n\nevidence in support of the idea that agricultural price increases lead to higher food prices. Oil price shocks do not \n\nappear to be causing any significant rise in retail food prices either. Moreover, McPhail (2011) finds that policy-\n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\ndriven demand shocks in the U.S. ethanol sector cause a significant decline in the world crude oil price, while ethanol \n\nsupply shocks do not have any significant influence on the world oil market.  \n\nFurthermore, Drabik, Ciaian and Pokrivcak (2014) perform a simulation for the U.S. corn sector and its \n\nlinkages with the ethanol and food sectors, comparing a benchmark scenario (world without biofuels) to scenarios, \n\nwhich account for the existence of biofuels under different regimes. The results suggest that biofuels affect the price \n\ntransmission along the food chain but this impact depends on the policy regime for biofuels.  \n\nKoirala and Mishra (2015) examine the relationship between agricultural commodity and energy futures \n\nprices in the U.S., taking into account the recent legislation changes, such as the Energy Independence and Security \n\nAct of 2007 and the Renewable Fuel Standard Program of 2014. The obtained results suggest the existence of a high \n\ncorrelation and a positive and significant relationship between the two examined markets, thus, providing empirical \n\nsupport that higher energy prices lead to elevated agricultural commodity prices in the country. \n\nRegarding changes in the existing price relationship between the biofuel-related sectors in the U.S. \n\nthrough time, Chiu et al. (2016) find that only between 2004 and 2006 there was a long-term relationship between \n\nthe prices of ethanol, corn and oil. Corn is found to lead ethanol prices through all analyzed periods, while the \n\npolicy-driven ethanol market does not have any significant impact on the other examined variables. Similar results \n\nare obtained by Bastianin, Galeotti and ?anera (2016), who find that the price of ethanol was significantly influenced \n\nby the price of corn between 1978 and 2012, while an effect in the opposite direction was not found.  \n\nApergis, Eleftheriou and Voliotis (2017) identify non-linearities and asymmetry in the price transmission \n\nbetween biofuel prices and a wide range of non-energy commodity prices in the U.S. The authors show that ethanol \n\nprices lead commodity prices and the latter have become more vulnerable to biofuel price fluctuations in recent \n\nyears.  \n\nThe majority of the reviewed works regarding the price transmission in the U.S. provide evidence for the \n\nexistence of a short-term relationship between energy, biofuel and agricultural commodity markets, with energy and \n\ncrop prices being the leader in most of the examined studies. There is no consensus, however, on the presence of a \n\nlong-term link between the prices of these commodities in the country. \n\n \n\n3.2.4. European Union \n\nThe biofuel-related price transmission for the Brazilian and U.S. markets has been thoroughly examined \n\nin the existing literature, but the same does not apply for the European biofuel sector, which has received much less \n\nattention from researchers. Since the predominant biofuel used in the countries from the EU is biodiesel produced \n\nfrom rapeseed oil or sunflower oil, the existing studies focus on the price relationships between this type of biofuel \n\nand the main crops used for its production. Peri and Baldi (2010), for instance, find a long-run cointegration \n\nrelationship between rapeseed oil and diesel in the EU, with the adjustments of rapeseed oil prices being asymmetric \n\nand depending on the divergence between the two price series.  \n\nSome authors consider the EU ethanol prices in their research, instead of focusing on biodiesel. Zafeiriou \n\net al. (2014) show that there exists a single long-run relationship between the prices of gasoline, ethanol and crude \n\noil, with the latter being the exogenous variable. Crude oil prices are found to have a negative impact on ethanol, \n\nwhile gasoline has a positive effect on this type of biofuel. \n\nMost of the reviewed studies, however, focus on a separate country from the EU with the main interest \n\nbeing on Spain and Germany, since they are among the major producers and consumers of biofuels in Europe. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nHassouneh, Serra and Gil (2011), for instance, concentrate on the energy-price relationships in Spain, examining the \n\ntransmission among biodiesel, sunflower and international crude oil prices. The obtained results suggest a long-run \n\nrelationship among the three price series, in which sunflower and crude oil are exogenous and biodiesel is the only \n\none to adjust to deviations in the established long-run parity.  \n\nPokrivcak and Rajcaniova (2011) study the relationship among ethanol and gasoline in Germany and \n\nEurope Brent crude oil prices. The authors find evidence for the existence of cointegration between oil and gasoline, \n\nbut such a relationship is not found between the other two pairs - ethanol and gasoline, and ethanol and oil. \n\nMoreover, Busse, Bruemmer and Ihle (2012) examine on the price relationships between diesel and biodiesel, \n\nrapeseed oil, and soy oil in Germany and show that there exists cointegration between the examined price pairs.  \n\nVery few research has been focused on the relationship between futures prices in the EU. Ziegelback and \n\nKastner (2011) analyze the linkages between European rapeseed futures price and conventional diesel futures prices. \n\nThey find an asymmetric long-run relationship between the two time series, which is consistent with the findings of \n\nPeri and Baldi (2010) for the price relationship between rapeseed oil and diesel in the EU. \n\nThe reviewed works in this subsection reveal the existence of a long-term relationship between fuel and \n\nfeedstock markets in the EU, in particular between diesel and rapeseed oil prices. Moreover, the majority of the \n\nresults suggest the presence of cointegration between fuel, biofuel and feedstock markets, with fuel being the price-\n\nleader in most of the examined cases.  \n\n \n\n3.2.5. International and comparative studies \n\nThis subsection focuses on the biofuel-related price transmission literature, which studies international \n\nprice relationships, as well as the existing research devoted to a comparison between the price transmission \n\nmechanisms across different countries. No consensus exists on the exact direction and the dynamics of the \n\nrelationships for the global biofuel-related markets.  \n\nCiaian and Kancs (2011) study the price dynamics for nine agricultural commodities traded internationally \n\nand develop a theoretical partial equilibrium model, which is further examined through time-series analysis. Their \n\nresults provide evidence for the existence of a cointegration relation between the prices of all studied commodities \n\nand crude oil. The authors find that the effect that energy prices have on agricultural commodities is stronger in the \n\npresence of biofuels than without the use of bioenergy in transportation. Similar results have been obtained by \n\nBracco (2014), who shows that biofuel production strengthened the relationship between global fuel and food \n\nmarkets, and that higher crude oil prices and increased biofuel production lead to elevated international food prices.  \n\nDrabik, Gorter and Timilsina (2014) examine how an international price shock in diesel will affect the \n\nworld soybean and rapeseed markets under different regimes regarding bioenergy. The main findings show that \n\nunder a mandate a diesel shock affects the international oilseed market less than under a tax exemption regime. \n\nWhen it comes to the effect on biodiesel, a diesel price increase under tax credit leads to higher biodiesel prices, but \n\nthis is not the case under a blending mandate. Furthermore, the results of To and Grafton (2015) show that oil prices \n\nand biofuel production have statistically and economically significant impact on international and U.S. food markets \n\nboth in the long- and in the short-run and were responsible for the food price increase after 2011.  \n\nIn regards to different methodologies used in the international price transmission literature, Vacha et al. \n\n(2015) apply the wavelet coherence analysis, when examining the price relationships between international biofuels \n\nand a range of related commodities. The authors identify two strongly correlated pairs, which hold during the entire \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nexamined period \u2013 ethanol is strongly correlated to corn, and biodiesel to German diesel. Kristoufek, Janda and \n\nZilberman (2013) provide further evidence for the results obtained by Vacha et al. (2015). \n\nAlthough few studies focus on analyzing the biofuel-related price relationships between different \n\ncountries, there exists a consensus in the existing literature that the U.S. is the main driver of energy and agricultural \n\ncommodity prices around the world, and prices in other countries follow the U.S. price changes. Liu (2007), for \n\ninstance, analyzes the integration among the three world ethanol markets \u2013 the U.S., Brazil and the EU. The \n\nobtained results suggest that both the American and the Brazilian ethanol markets Granger-cause the EU biofuel \n\nmarket, with the U.S. being the most influential. The EU, on the other hand, appears to have almost no effect on the \n\nethanol industry in the other two countries.  \n\nMoreover, Rosa and Vasciaevo (2012) test the hypothesis of the existence of price transmission between \n\nthe U.S. and the Italian energy and agricultural markets. They identify the existence of a long-term relationship \n\nbetween crude oil and the examined agricultural commodities in the U.S., as well as integration between the Italian \n\nand the American agricultural markets. The Italian commodity prices, however, do not show such a pronounced \n\nrelation with international crude oil. \n\nWhen it comes to comparing domestic price linkages across different countries, the existing research is \n\nrather scarce. Tokgoz and Elobeid (2006) perform a study in order to understand the dynamics between corn and \n\nethanol markets in the U.S., and sugar and ethanol in Brazil. The authors find evidence for different effects of fuel \n\nprices on the ethanol industries in the two countries. An increase in gasoline prices leads to a rise in hydrous ethanol \n\nconsumption in Brazil, while in the U.S. higher gasoline prices result in lower demand for ethanol, since the latter is \n\nused as a complementary product mainly for blending. Moreover, the authors show that increased corn prices in the \n\nU.S. lead to a reduction in ethanol production, while in the case of Brazil, higher sugar prices incentive the \n\nproduction of sugar from sugarcane in expense of the production of ethanol.  \n\nSilveira and Mattos (2015) perform a comparative analysis between the price and volatility transmission in \n\nthe grain and livestock markets in the U.S. and in Brazil and find evidence for a long-term relationship between the \n\ntwo markets of interest in both countries. This relationship, however, was found to be different, due to the existing \n\ndissimilarities between the biofuel markets in the two examined countries.  \n\nIn addition, Bentivoglio (2016) performs a comparative analysis between the price transmission of the \n\nbiofuel-related sectors in Brazil and in the European Union, identifying a long-term relationship between the \n\nanalyzed price series for both models. The obtained results provide evidence that between 2007 and 2013 the price \n\nof biodiesel in the EU was positively related in the long-run to the price of its main feedstock \u2013 rapeseed oil, while in \n\nBrazil the price of ethanol was found to be strongly related to the gasoline price instead of to the price of sugar, thus, \n\nindicating a different type of price transmission in the two analyzed contexts.  \n\nKristoufek, Janda and Zilberman (2016) use the wavelet coherence methodology in order to examine the \n\nprice transmission between anhydrous ethanol and sugar prices in Brazil and ethanol and corn prices in the U.S. \n\nThey find evidence for a stable positive long-term relationship between the price series in both countries, thus, \n\nimplying that there exist similarities in the behavior of the biofuel markets in Brazil and in the U.S. The main \n\nconclusion of the paper is that feedstock prices lead the price of biofuels in both economies in the short- and as well \n\nas in the long-run.  \n\nFilip et al. (2016) compare the price transmission between biofuel prices and 32 biofuel-related \n\ncommodities and assets in Brazil, in the United States and in the European Union. Using a wavelet coherence \n\nframework, the authors identify strong, positive and stable long-term relationship between the price of biofuels and \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\ntheir main feedstock in Brazil and in the U.S., while such a stable relation was not identified between biodiesel and \n\nrapeseed oil in the EU, thus, indicating that biofuels have different positions in the fuel-food systems in the \n\nEuropean countries, since biodiesel production does not depend on one single feedstock.  \n\nBased on the literature review presented in this subsection, it can be concluded that a thorough \n\ncomparison between the biofuel-related price transmission mechanisms in Brazil, the U.S. and Germany has not \n\nbeen performed yet. Thus, the goal of the present study is to fill in this gap in the existing state-of-the-art literature. \n\n \n\n3.3. METHODOLOGY  \n\n3.3.1. Stationarity tests \n\nThis study relies on time series techniques for performing the analysis, which requires taking into account \n\nsome general statistical properties of the time series data a priori (SERRA; ZILBERMAN, 2013). The first property \n\nto be considered is the stationarity of the examined variables. Stationary data is characterized by time-constancy of its \n\nstatistical distribution and such a time series is considered to be a process integrated of order zero - I(0). \n\nCommon practices in time series modelling involve the application of the augmented Dickey-Fuller and \n\nthe Phillips-Perron tests for determining whether a data series is stationary or not. The proposed by Elliott, \n\nRothenberg and Stock (1996) DF-GLS test, however, has significantly greater power and better overall performance \n\nin terms of small-sample sizes, dominating the ordinary Dickey-Fuller tests (HATANAKA, 1996). This test \n\nrepresents a modified version of the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, in which the series has been transformed by a \n\ngeneralized least-squares regression. The DF-GLS test is performed fitting a regression of the following form \n\n(ELLIOTT; ROTHENBERG; STOCK, 1996): \n\n \n\n?? =  ? + ????? + ?? ????? + ??????? + ? + ?? ?????  + ??      (3.1) \n\n \nwhere k is the number of lags of first-differenced, detrended variables. The number of lags of the process \n\nhas to be chosen appropriately. Lags should be added to the model only until they are significant, i.e. until there is no \n\nserial correlation in the error term. For this purpose, information criteria like the Ng-Perron, the Schwarz Criterion \n\nand the Modified Akaike Information Criterion are used. \n\nThere are two forms of the DF-GLS test \u2013 GLS detrending (where the series to be tested is regressed on \n\na constant and linear trend) and GLS demeaning (where only a constant appears in the first-stage regression). The \n\nnull hypothesis of the DF-GLS test assumes that the ??  is a random walk, possibly with drift. There are two \n\nalternative hypotheses depending on the chosen form of the test: ??  is stationary about a linear time trend, and ??  is \n\nstationary with a possible nonzero mean but with no linear time trend.  \n\nThe price series of the biofuel-related markets in Brazil, the U.S. and Germany are tested for stationarity \n\nusing the DF-GLS test before proceeding with the further analysis. Both models of the test are used in order to \n\ncheck if the results are robust. Moreover, in order to account for the global financial crisis of 2008, the entire sample \n\nis split into two sub-periods: 07/2005-12/2008 and 01/2009-11/2016. Thus, the stationarity test is applied for the \n\nentire sample, as well as, for each sub-period. \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Cointegration and VECM \n\nAnother time series property that is tested in this work is the existence of a long-term relationship among \n\nthe variables, or the so called cointegration. The formal development of this key concept was done by the Nobel \n\nlaureates Clive Granger and Robert Engle (ENGLE; GRANGER, 1987). A vector time series ??  is said to be \n\ncointegrated if its individual elements are nonstationary but there exists a stationary linear combination of them - \n\n???? , for some nonzero vector ? called cointegration vector (HAMILTON, 1994). More precisely, the existence of \n\ncointegration implies that even though some permanent changes in the elements of ??  may occur, these elements are \n\ntied by the equilibrium relationship ????  and tend to return to it in the long-run.  \n\nThe proposed by Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) cointegration test is based on a vector \n\nautoregression (VAR) model with p lags of a nonstationary n-dimensional process integrated of order one with \n\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian errors. The authors derive the maximum likelihood estimator \n\nof the cointegration vectors and perform a likelihood ratio test for the hypothesis that there exists a given number of \n\ncointegration vectors. \n\n A VAR model of an I(1) process ??  describes the dynamic interactions among the set of variables \n\ncollected in the vector ??  and takes the following form (HAMILTON, 1994): \n\n?? =  ? + ?????? + ?????? + ? + ?????? + ??    (3.3) \n\nwhere ??  is the matrix of autoregressive coefficients, ? is the constant term, and ?? is a vector \n\ngeneralization of a white noise process with variance ?, which is a symmetric positive definite matrix.  \n\nIf the elements of the vector ??  are cointegrated, then the VAR model cannot be used to fit the data. \n\nInstead, an error-correction feature should be added to the VAR, which accounts for the existence of a long-term \n\nrelationship between the variables. Such a model is called a vector error-correction model (VECM). VEC models are \n\nuseful tools in time series, since they allow the direct estimation of the speed at which a dependent variable returns to \n\nits long-term equilibrium after a change in an independent variable. These models account not only for long-term \n\nrelationships, but also for short-term interactions between the variables. Given the VAR process from equation (3.3) \n\nthe VEC representation of this model takes the following form (LUTKEPOHL, 2005): \n\n??? =  ??????? + ??????? + ? + ??????????? + ????? +  ??      (3.4) \n\nwhere: \n\n?? =  ? ? + ?? + ? + ?? ,   i= 1,2,\u2026 ,? ? 1 (3.5) \n\nThus, the matrix ? is a function of ? (? =  ? ?? ) and consists of the coefficients that measure the long-\n\nterm adjustments of the variables, while the ? matrix contains the coefficients that measure the adjustments of the \n\nmodel in the short-run.  \n\nThe rank of the matrix ? can be used to test for the existence and the number of cointegration vectors. If \n\n ????(?) = 0, this means that there is no cointegration between the variables and a traditional VAR model can be \n\nused to examine their relationship. If ????(?) = ?, i.e. the matrix has a full rank, then the variables cannot be I(1), \n\nimplying that ??  is a stationary process. Finally, if 0&lt;????(?) = ? &lt;?, then the variables are cointegrated and the \n\nnumber of cointegration vectors is equal to the rank r. Consequently, there exist two (n x r) matrices - ? and ?, such \n\nthat ? = ???, where the the ?\u2019s are the cointegration vectors and the linear combination ????  is stationary, while the \n\nmatrix ? contains information on the speed of adjustment of the variables in the long-run. In this case, the \n\napplication of the VAR model is inappropriate, and ??  can be interpreted as an error-correction model. \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nIn order to test the hypothesis that there are at most r cointegration vectors, Johansen (1988) and \n\nJohansen and Juselius (1990) apply a likelihood ratio test where the null hypothesis being tested is the following: \n\n??:????(?) ? ? ?? ? = ???  (3.6) \n\nThe Johansen cointegration test is applied to the price series data for the biofuel-related markets in the \n\nthree selected countries in order to check for the existence of a long-term relationship between the variables during \n\nthe entire analyzed period as well as during the two sub-periods. If such a long-term relationship is encountered, the \n\nanalysis proceeds with the application of a VECM estimation, so that the cointegration vectors can be obtained and \n\nthe coefficients for the short- and long-term adjustment of the variables in the system can be estimated. If the \n\nexamined prices do not show any cointegration relationship, the analysis of their interrelations proceeds with the \n\nfitting of a VAR model with an appropriate number of lags, chosen by the results of the Akaike and Schwarz \n\ninformation criteria in their multi-equational form.  \n\n \n\n3.3.3. Granger causality test \n\nCointegration, however, does not say anything about the causality of series interdependencies, which is \n\nalso an important aspect when analyzing price transmissions. The causality relationship between two time series can \n\nbe examined applying the Granger causality test. According to Granger (1969), causality implies that a variable ??  \n\ncauses another variable ??  if ?\n?(? |??) >  ? ?(? |??,??), where ? ?(? |??) represents the minimum predictive error \n\nvariance of ??  using only past values of this variable, and ?\n?(? |??,??) is the variance of the prediction of ??  using \n\npast values of both ??  and ?? . Granger (1969) denotes this causality as ??  ? ?? .  \n\n Let\u2019s assume that ??  and ??  are two stationary time series with zero means expressed in the following \n\nway: \n\n?? =  ? ?? ????\n?\n?? ? +  ? ?? ???? +  ??\n\n?\n?? ?        (3.7) \n\n?? =  ? ?? ????\n?\n?? ? +  ? ?? ???? +  ??\n\n?\n?? ?         (3.8) \n\nwhere ?? and ?? are two uncorrelated white noise series of errors. Under these assumptions, Granger \n\n(1969) shows that ??  is causing ?? , if the coefficient ??  is non zero. Alternatively, ??  is causing ?? , if the coefficient ??  \n\nis non zero. If both of these events occur, then there exists a feedback (or bidirectional) relationship between ??  and \n\n?? , denoted as ?? ?  ?? . \n\nAccording to Hamilton (1994), testing for Granger causality can be done using F-test with null hypothesis \n\n??: ?? = 0,?? = 0. One way of performing this F-test for checking if the variable ??  causes ?? , for instance, is \n\ncalculating the sum of squared residuals of equation (3.8) (RSS1) and then comparing it with the sum of squared \n\nresiduals of a univariate autoregression on ??  (RSS0) in the following way: \n\n?? =  \n(???? ????? ) ??\n\n???? (? ?????)?\n ~  ?(?,? ? 2? ? 1)       (3.9) \n\nIf the test statistic ?? is sufficiently large (exceeds the critical value of the F-test at the chosen significance \n\nlevel), the null hypothesis can be rejected, which implies that the variable ??  Granger-causes the variable ?? . Another \n\nalternative is the application of the Wald test, which tests the hypothesis that in a VAR model each of the \n\nendogenous variables does not Granger-cause the dependent variable in that equation.  \n\nAs mentioned above, for each country of interest a cointegration test is performed and, depending on its \n\nresults, a VAR or a VEC model is estimated for the specific time period. For the cases when no long-term \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nrelationship is found between the variables, a VAR model is estimated in order to determine the short-term \n\ninteractions between the price series and a Granger causality test is performed in order to verify the VAR results and \n\nto provide insights on the causality of the encountered short-term relationships between the variables. \n\n \n\n3.3.4. Model specification \n\nAssuming that evidence for the existence of a cointegration relationship between the variables was found \n\nfrom the Johansen cointegration test, the following VECM representations are estimated for Brazil, the U.S. and \n\nGermany, respectively: \n\n???\n? = ? ?????\n\n? + ????????\n?  + ????????\n\n? + ? + ????,????????\n? + ?? +  ??,?  (3.10) \n\n???\n?? = ? ?????\n\n?? + ????????\n??  + ????????\n\n?? + ? + ????,????????\n?? + ?? +  ??,?    (3.11) \n\n???\n? = ? ?????\n\n? + ????????\n?  + ????????\n\n? + ? + ????,????????\n? + ?? +  ??,?    (3.12) \n\nwhere ??\n?  is a vector consisting of the price of hydrous ethanol (??,?\n\n? ), the price of gasoline C (??,?\n? ), and \n\nof sugar (??,?\n? ) at period t, which refer to the Brazilian market; ??\n\n??  is a vector consisting of ethanol (??,?\n?? ), gasoline \n\n(?? ,?\n?? ), and corn (?? ,?\n\n?? ) prices for the U.S. market at period t; and  ??\n?  consists of biodiesel (??,?\n\n? ), diesel (??,?\n? ), and \n\nrapeseed oil (??,?\n? ) prices for Germany.  \n\nTaking into account the specific characteristics of the Brazilian fuel and biofuel sectors, it is expected that \n\nthe results will provide evidence for the existence of a tight long-term relationship between hydrous ethanol and \n\nsugar prices, since the two commodities are derived from sugarcane and are competing on the supply side. \n\nMoreover, evidence for price transmission is anticipated for the domestic prices of gasoline and ethanol, due to the \n\nfact that the two fuels act as substitutes on the Brazilian market. The relationship between the prices of these fuels is \n\nassumed to be amplified by the fact that they act as complements as well, since pure gasoline is not available in the \n\ncountry, but rather a blend with 27% of anhydrous ethanol. \n\nFor the U.S. market, it is expected that the obtained results will show the existence of transmission \n\nbetween the prices of ethanol and corn, since the use of this feedstock for the production of biofuels directly \n\ninfluences the amount of corn that goes for feeding and alimentation and its price levels. Moreover, a tight \n\nrelationship between ethanol and gasoline prices is anticipated, since ethanol is highly used for blending. The \n\nsubstitutability between fuels and biofuels in the U.S., however, is restricted by the automobile fleet, because the \n\nmajority of cars in the country is not suited for running on high blends of ethanol. This fact constitutes the main \n\ndifference between the biofuel industries in Brazil and in the U.S., implying that the price transmission in the two \n\ncountries will be rather different.  \n\nThe results of the price transmission analysis for Germany are presumed to indicate a relationship \n\nbetween the prices of biodiesel and rapeseed oil, since the latter is considered a major feedstock for biodiesel \n\nproduction in the country. This relationship, however, is assumed to be rather different than what is observed in the \n\nother two examined countries, mainly because rapeseed oil is not the single feedstock for the production of biofuels, \n\nas is the case with sugarcane in Brazil and corn in the U.S. In addition, for the three countries of interest, it is \n\nexpected that the price relationship between the biofuel-related sectors changed after the financial crisis of 2008, \n\nwhich is assumed to have tightened the linkages between the examined variables. \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n3.4. Data description \n\nThe data used in this paper consists of the following price series: \n\n? Hydrous ethanol monthly average distribution price, Brazil, BRL/liter (NPA); \n\n? Gasoline C monthly average distribution price, Brazil, BRL/liter (NPA); \n\n? Sugar producer price for S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, daily, BRL/sack (Center for Advanced Studies on \n\nApplied Economics/\u201cLuiz de Queiroz\u201d College of Agriculture - CEPEA/ESALQ); \n\n? Ethanol price, Iowa, U.S., monthly, USD/gallon (U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2013 USDA); \n\n? Gasoline price, U.S., monthly, USD/gallon (USDA); \n\n? Corn price, Iowa, U.S., monthly, USD/bushel (USDA); \n\n? Biodiesel wholesale price, Germany, monthly, EUR cents/liter (Union for the Promotion of Oil \n\nand Protein Plants - UFOP); \n\n? Diesel wholesale price, Germany, monthly, EUR/hectoliter (Federal Statistical office of \n\nGermany - Destatis); \n\n? Rapeseed oil wholesale price, Germany, monthly, fob, EUR/t (UFOP). \n\n \n\nAll data series were obtained from secondary sources and consist of fuel and biofuel related prices for \n\nBrazil, Germany and the United States, referring to the period July, 2005 - November, 2016. The choice of the \n\nanalyzed period is justified by the fact that the production and use of biofuels started gaining international \n\nimportance only after 2005, as pointed out by Silveira and Mattos (2015). In addition, the examined period was split \n\ninto two sub-periods in order to account for the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008. The price transmission \n\nanalysis is performed for the entire sample, as well as for the two separate sub-periods referring to July, 2005 - \n\nDecember, 2008, and January, 2009 - November, 2016. \n\nThe price of sugar was used in the model for Brazil as a proxy of the price of the main feedstock for the \n\nproduction of biofuels in the country. The choice is justified by the fact that sugarcane prices in Brazil do not \n\nfluctuate freely and are calculated at regular time periods, while the production of ethanol and sugar from the same \n\nraw material implies a tight relationship between the two commodities that act as substitutes on the supply side. For \n\nGermany, the price of rapeseed oil was included in the analysis. Even though different feedstock is used for the \n\nproduction of biofuel in this country, such as sunflower, palm and soybean oil, according to Flach et al. (2016), \n\nrapeseed oil is the major raw material for biodiesel.  \n\nIn order to make the data comparable for the purposes of the study, all prices were transformed into \n\nmonthly average and converted to USD, using the monthly average BRL/USD and EUR/USD exchange rates \n\npublished by OECD. More precisely, the prices of fuels and biofuels were converted into USD/liter in order to \n\nfacilitate the analysis. All data was transformed into log terms, which allows the interpretation of the estimated \n\ncoefficients of the VEC and VAR models as elasticities of price transmission. The figures below plot the studied \n\nprice series for the three countries of interest.  \n\nExamining the historical evolution of ethanol, gasoline and sugar prices in Brazil (figure 12), it can be \n\nnoticed that the prices of the two fuel alternatives experienced strong co-movements, especially after the global \n\nfinancial crisis. During the entire period, the gap between the gasoline and ethanol prices remained rather stable. \n\nConcerning sugar and ethanol, the two series appeared to be moving together before 2008 and especially after 2012. \n\nThe price of sugar registered significant fluctuations and followed an increasing trend between 2011 and 2013, which \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\ncorresponds to a period of high international commodity prices. The observed trends on the graph, however, can \n\nsignificantly differ from the short-term dynamics between the variables. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12. Monthly average producer prices of hydrous ethanol, gasoline C and sugar for Brazil between July, 2005 and \nNovember, 2016 \n\nSource: NPA, CEPEA/ESALQ. \n\n \nFigure 13 plots the biofuel-related prices for the U.S. market. As it can be seen on the graph, ethanol and \n\ngasoline exhibited mild co-movements during the observed period. The price of gasoline reacted significantly to the \n\nglobal financial crisis of 2008, following the fluctuations in the international crude oil price from this period. The \n\nreaction of the ethanol price to the financial crisis was not as prominent as of gasoline. The prices of the two fuels \n\nfor the U.S. market appeared to be more related after the crisis years and to exhibit strong co-movements especially \n\nafter January, 2014.  \n\nThe price of corn, on the other hand, appeared to be rather independent than the other two price series. \n\nIt registered a significant upward trend after 2011, which persisted until 2013. Afterwards, the price of corn remained \n\nrather stable - between 3 and 4 USD/bushel. As it can be seen on the graph, corn and ethanol prices moved together \n\nonly between 2008 and 2013.   \n\nThe differences between the situation in Brazil and in the U.S. are rather prominent when figures 12 and \n\n13 are compared. It is noticeable that the biofuel-related prices oscillated much more in the U.S. than in Brazil, which \n\ncan be explained by the fact that in this country there is no government intervention in the domestic fuel sector, \n\nwhile in Brazil the government determines the ex-refinery price of all petroleum derivatives. In addition, considering \n\nthe results of the graphic analysis, the prices of both fuels in Brazil exhibited a close and stable relationship during \n\nthe entire period, while such a noticeable transmission between the two price series in the U.S. cannot be observed \n\non figure 13. \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13. Monthly average producer prices of ethanol, gasoline and corn for the United States between July, 2005 and \nNovember, 2016 \n\nSource: USDA, EIA. \n\n \n\nFor Germany, strong co-movements between the three prices of interest can be observed on figure 14 for \n\nthe period before the financial crisis. Biodiesel, diesel and rapeseed oil showed a clear relationship during the first \n\nsub-period. After 2008, however, no significant co-movements between the price series can be observed for the \n\nGerman market. The tight relationship between the biofuel-related prices in the country was broken after the crisis \n\nyears.  \n\nUntil 2011 German biodiesel remained cheaper than diesel, but since January, 2013, the domestic \n\nbiodiesel price surpassed the diesel price and remained at higher levels ever since. The rapeseed oil price, on the \n\nother hand, started a downward trend in 2011, which went on until the end of the analyzed period. Moreover, it is \n\nnoticeable that after 2015 the German diesel price registered a significant drop, which followed the fall in the \n\ninternational crude oil price from the same period. When compared with Brazil and the United States, the case of \n\nGermany is rather different. Instead of a stronger relationship between the examined price series after the financial \n\ncrisis, as it is observed on the graphs of the other two countries, German biofuel-related prices do not appear to \n\nfollow the same trends after 2008. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14.

Stationarity test \n\nPrior to performing the analysis, the data series were tested for stationarity using the DF-GLS test. Both \n\nmodels of the test were used and the number of lags was chosen using the Schwarz information Criterion (SIC). The \n\nresults for the entire sample are shown in table 5. All variables were found to have a unit root in level, but they are \n\nstationary in their first difference (all data series are I(1)). Same results hold for the two sub-periods, the results for \n\nwhich are presented in tables 1 and 2 in Appendix A. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nTable 5.

Cointegration test and VECM estimation results \n\nThe Johansen cointegration trace statistic test results for the three countries of interest are reported in \n\ntable 6. For Brazil, one cointegration relationship is found when the entire sample is considered. This long-term link \n\nis prominent during the first sub-period, while after the financial crisis the results of the performed test point \n\ntowards the existence of two cointegration equations. This finding is in line with the common conclusion in the \n\nliterature that there exists a long-term relationship between the biofuel-related prices in Brazil (RODRIGUES, 2009; \n\nBLOCK; CORONEL; VELOSO, 2012; BENTIVOGLIO; FINCO; BACCHI, 2016). \n\nFor the United States, the hypothesis of the existence of a long-term link between the variables in the \n\nsystem cannot be rejected when the entire analyzed period is considered. Evidence for such a cointegration \n\nrelationship is found between 2008 and 2016, while it disappears when the first sub-period is considered.  \n\nFor the German data, the results of the performed Johansen trace statistic test presented in table 6 show \n\nthat the price series are cointegrated of order one during the first sub-period. Such a long-term link, however, cannot \n\nbe identified between 2005 and 2016 and during the period after the crisis.  \n\nThe results of the performed cointegration test provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that the \n\nfinancial crisis of 2008 has altered the relationship between the examined variables in the three countries of interest. \n\nThe analysis proceeded with the fitting of a VECM to the data during the periods when long-term relationships were \n\nidentified, while for the situations where no evidence for cointegration was found, the estimation was performed by \n\nfitting a VAR model to the data and applying the Granger causality test.  \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nTable 6.

Two lags were included in the three estimated systems, in line with the results of the Akaike and Schwarz \n\ninformation criteria in their multi-equational form. The R2 and the F-statistic of the models show that the data fits \n\nwell and the inclusion of error-correction terms is necessary.  \n\nWhen the entire sample is considered, the estimated long-term adjustment coefficients for all variables \n\nwere found statistically significant and negative, implying that the prices of ethanol, gasoline and sugar in Brazil \n\nparticipate in the adjustment process towards long-run equilibrium. This result is rather in line with the expected, \n\nsince the characteristics of the Brazilian biofuel-related sectors imply a strong long-term relation between the three \n\nprices of interest. The negative sign of the estimated coefficients means that when the system is above its long-term \n\nequilibrium, the prices of ethanol, gasoline and sugar must fall in order to restore the cointegration relationship.  \n\nThe obtained values of the coefficients show that ethanol adjusts faster than gasoline and sugar, with \n\n0.25% of the ethanol price being adjusted in the long-run. Moreover, the estimated cointegration equation for the \n\nentire analyzed period: P?,?\n? = 0.4487 P?,?\n\n? + 0.3438 P?,?\n?  , implies that a positive shock in the prices of gasoline and \n\nsugar has a positive long-term effect on the price of ethanol. Similar results have been obtained by Rodrigues (2009) \n\nand Bentivoglio, Finco and Bacchi (2016). \n\nDuring the first sub-period, the estimated long-term adjustment coefficients of the VECM show that only \n\nthe price of ethanol participated in the adjustment process towards the cointegration relationship, while after 2008 \n\nthe prices of gasoline and sugar entered the long-term adjustment process. These results indicate that the price \n\ntransmission between the biofuel-related sectors in Brazil became stronger after the global financial crisis. Moreover, \n\nduring the second sub-period, the price of sugar was found to adjust faster to the long-term equilibrium than the \n\nprices of the other two analyzed commodities, while ethanol had the highest speed of adjustment between 2005 and \n\n2008.  \n\nThe obtained results for the Brazilian market show that the long-term relationship between the examined \n\nprice series changed after the financial crisis, when ethanol, gasoline and sugar became more interrelated. This \n\nfinding can be attributed to the existing differences between the two examined periods. During the first sub-period, \n\ninternational sugar prices were relatively stable, the Brazilian ethanol sector was flourishing, and the BRL/USD \n\nexchange rate was decreasing. The second sub-period, on the other hand, was characterized by record high levels of \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\ninternational sugar prices, especially between 2011 and 2014, crisis in the Brazilian ethanol sector associated with \n\ninsufficient supply and a need of imports from the U.S., and high BRL/USD exchange rate indicating weak national \n\ncurrency. Thus, the unfavorable conditions after 2008 brought distortions to the domestic biofuel-related sectors and \n\ninduced a change in the long-term relationship between the price series. \n\n \n\nTable 7.

For the \n\ninterpretation of the cointegration equations, the signs of the coefficients need to be inverted. \n\n \n\nWhen it comes to the short-term interactions between the variables for the Brazilian market, the results \n\nshow that all prices reacted significantly and positively to changes in their own lagged values, with the only exception \n\nof gasoline in the second sub-period. Regarding the short-term transmission between the different price series, \n\nbetween 2005 and 2008 only the price of sugar was found to affect significantly the price of ethanol. A 1%-increase \n\nin the price of sugar at period t-1 caused a 0.35%-increase in the price of ethanol at period t. When the entire sample \n\nis considered, the estimated coefficient for the short-term impact of gasoline on the price of ethanol was found to be \n\nnegative. This coefficient, however, is not statistically different than zero. \n\nThe situation changed after the financial crisis, when variations in the prices of both ethanol and gasoline \n\nwere found to have a significant impact on the price of sugar. In addition, the obtained results provide evidence for a \n\nbidirectional short-term relationship between the two fuel alternatives for the period after 2008. A 1%-increase in the \n\nprice of gasoline led to a 0.49%-decrease in the price of ethanol, while a 1%-change in the price of the biofuel, \n\ncaused a positive response of approximately 0.2% in the price of its substitute.  \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nThe estimated short-term coefficients for Brazil show that the price relationship between the biofuel-\n\nrelated sectors in the country changed after 2008, suggesting more interaction between the examined variables, with \n\nsugar becoming more dependent on the domestic price fluctuations of gasoline and ethanol after the crisis years. \n\nThis change in the short-term price transmission in the country can be attributed to a number of negative trends \n\nobserved in the Brazilian biofuel-related sectors, especially after 2011. The use of ethanol in the country lost its \n\ncompetitiveness and the sector entered a supply crisis, while Petrobras was importing gasoline and diesel at high \n\nBRL/USD exchange rate in order to satisfy domestic fuel demand. Meanwhile, international sugar prices reached \n\nrecord levels, which impacted the Brazilian market, stimulating the production of sugar from sugarcane instead of \n\nethanol, thus, creating a tighter link between the prices of the two commodities competing for the same feedstock. \n\nThese results show that the price transmission between the biofuel-related sectors in the country is influenced by \n\ninternational factors when it comes to sugar, since Brazil is a major global producer and consumer of this commodity \n\nand its domestic market is highly related to the international sugar sector.  \n\nFor the United States, a VECM with two lags and one rank was estimated for the entire sample and for \n\nthe second sub-period. The values of the R2 and the F-statistic show that the data fits well the estimated models. No \n\ncointegration relationship was found for the period between 2005 and 2008, thus, a VAR model with one lag of the \n\nfirst difference of the data was estimated for this sub-period followed by a Granger causality test.

The estimated models include only a constant. For the \n\ninterpretation of the cointegration equations, the signs of the coefficients need to be inverted. \n\n \nFor the entire analyzed period, the estimated long-term adjustment coefficient for the U.S. market is \n\nstatistically different than zero only for the price of gasoline, while the other two commodities were not found to \n\nadjust towards the long-term equilibrium. After the financial crisis, however, ethanol entered the cointegration \n\nrelationship, implying that the prices of the two fuels become more tightly connected after 2008. The price of corn, \n\non the other hand, remained exogenous in the long-run during all analyzed periods.  \n\nThe obtained results for the U.S. market show that the long-term relationship between the biofuel-related \n\nmarkets in the country strengthened after the financial crisis. This finding is in line with Rajcaniova, Drabik and \n\nCiaian (2013) and Gorter, Drabik and Just (2015) which provide evidence for a tight relationship between the \n\nbiofuel-related prices in the U.S. in recent years as a result of the establishment of blending mandates and the \n\nsuppression of tax incentives. \n\nThe main feedstock in the U.S., however, remained exogenous during both sub-periods \u2013 a result rather \n\ndifferent than what was observed in Brazil. This finding can be attributed to the fact that the country is the number \n\none producer, consumer and exporter of corn worldwide (USDA, 2016), which implies that its corn sector is highly \n\nrelated to the international market of this commodity. Thus, the exogeneity of the domestic corn price in the long-\n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nrun is a result rather in line with the expected, considering the position of the country in the international context. In \n\ncontrast, for the case of Brazil, the price of sugar became more interrelated with the domestic biofuel market after \n\n2008, indicating a different effect of the crisis period on the price transmission mechanisms in these two countries.  \n\nIn the short-run, for all analyzed periods, the results show that gasoline and corn prices adjusted to \n\nchanges in their own lagged values. The price of the main feedstock was found to have a significant and rather strong \n\npositive impact on the prices of both ethanol and gasoline between 2005 and 2008, while such a short-term effect \n\nwas not found after the financial crisis, when none of the estimated short-term adjustment coefficients for the effects \n\nof the price of corn on the two fuel alternatives was statistically significant. During the first sub-period, a 1%-\n\nincrease in the price of corn in period t-1 caused a 0.6171%-increase in the price of ethanol in period t and a 0.6499% \n\nincrease in the price of gasoline.  \n\nWhen it comes to the price of the main fossil fuel in the U.S., it was found to be affected in the short-\n\nterm by all other prices in the system when the entire sample is considered. When the analysis is performed only for \n\nthe data between 2005 and 2008, the Granger causality test results show that there existed a unidirectional \n\ntransmission from corn to gasoline prices. This short-term effect, however, disappeared after the crisis period. \n\nRegarding the response of the price of corn in the short-run, it was found to be negatively affected by \n\nshocks in the price of gasoline when the entire period is analyzed, while this effect disappeared when the two sub-\n\nperiods are considered separately. None of the variables was found to Granger-cause the price of corn before 2008 \n\nand it remained exogenous after the financial crisis, as well. This finding provides insights on the food vs. fuel \n\ndebate, showing that ethanol production did not have a significant direct negative impact on corn prices in the U.S., \n\nwhich is in line with the conclusions of other studies in the existing literature (ZHANG et al., 2010; CHIU et al., \n\n2016; BASTIANIN; GALEOTTI; MANERA, 2016).  \n\nThe obtained results for the U.S. market, indicate that the relationship between the domestic gasoline and \n\nethanol prices tightened after the financial crisis. This finding can be attributed to the trends in the American biofuel \n\nsector from that period. After 2005, ethanol gained significant importance in the domestic fuel market due to the \n\nintroduction of the Energy Policy Act together with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. This boosted \n\ndomestic ethanol production, making the country the number one player on the international biofuel scene in terms \n\nof ethanol production, which registered record high levels first in 2011 and later on in 2014 (EIA, 2016). In addition, \n\nthe second RFS program was introduced in 2010 and the different degrees of credit offered to the participants in the \n\nethanol sector, such as the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) and the Small Ethanol Producer Credit \n\nwere eliminated in 2011. Moreover, the period between 2009 and 2016 was rather turbulent when the international \n\nprice of crude oil is considered. It reacted significantly to the global financial crisis, established itself on higher levels \n\nin the following years and registered a dramatic drop in the beginning of 2015. These trends affected the domestic \n\nfuel market in the U.S., since the country is a major crude oil consumer and importer and its domestic fuel prices \n\nfollow the international oil price fluctuations. Thus, the rather turbulent period between 2009 and 2016 can be \n\nconsidered the main reason for the altered relationship between the biofuel-related sectors in the country.  \n\nFor Germany, no cointegration was identified when the entire sample is considered, as well as during the \n\nsecond sub-period, thus, a VAR model on the log differences of the data was estimated for these two periods and a \n\nGranger causality test was performed in order to verify the results. A VECM with one rank and one lag was \n\nestimated for the period before the financial crisis, in accordance with the results of the Johansen cointegration test \n\npresented above. The obtained coefficients of the estimated models for the German market are presented in table 9. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nRegarding the entire analyzed sample, the estimated results of the VAR model show that the price of \n\nbiodiesel responded positively to changes in the other two variables in the system. A 1%-increase in the price of \n\ndiesel led to a 0.25%-increase in the price of biodiesel, while a positive shock in the price of rapeseed oil caused a \n\n0.19%-increase in the price of this type of biofuel. Moreover, biodiesel remained endogenous in the system, without \n\ncausing any significant response in the other variables. The price of diesel, on the other hand, was found to be \n\nsignificantly affected by the price of rapeseed oil, while the latter reacted positively to changes in the price of this \n\ntype of fuel from the previous period.  \n\nThe performed Granger causality test supports the results of the estimated VAR model, indicating a \n\nunidirectional causality from the price of rapeseed oil and diesel towards the price of biodiesel, as well as a \n\nbidirectional relationship between rapeseed oil and diesel prices. These results provide evidence for the tight short-\n\nterm linkage existing between the prices of fuel and feedstock in Germany, while the price of the main biofuel was \n\nnot found to have such a strong position as observed in Brazil and in the United States. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nTable 9.

The estimated models include only a constant. For the \n\ninterpretation of the cointegration equations, the signs of the coefficients need to be inverted. \n\n \n\nBefore the global financial crisis, one cointegration relation was identified between the biofuel-related \n\nprices in Germany. The long-term adjustment coefficients of the estimated VECM with one lag were statistically \n\nsignificant and negative for the three price series, implying that if the system is above its equilibrium level, the prices \n\nof the three commodities must decrease in order to bring it back to stability. The price of biodiesel was found to \n\nadjust the most between 2005 and 2008, with a long-term adjustment coefficient equal to 0.63%. Moreover, the \n\nestimated cointegration equation shows that diesel and rapeseed oil had a positive long-term impact on the domestic \n\nprice of biodiesel.  \n\nThis long-term relationship between the three price series for the German market, however, disappeared \n\nafter the crisis. The estimated VAR model and the results of the Granger causality test for the second sub-period \n\nshow that there was no short-term relation between the examined variables. None of the short-term coefficients was \n\nfound to be statistically significant. The null hypotheses of no Granger causality between the variables could not be \n\nrejected, implying no short-term price transmission between the biofuel-related sectors in Germany after 2008. This \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nresult is in line with the conclusion of Pokrivcak and Rajcaniova (2011), according to which no cointegration exists \n\nbetween the biofuel-related sectors in this country. \n\nThe estimated results for the German market show that the prices of biodiesel, diesel and rapeseed oil in \n\nGermany were tightly related between 2005 and 2008, which can be attributed to the fast growth of the biofuel \n\nsector in the country during this period as a result of the adopted policy changes stimulating the production of this \n\nfuel alternative. The European Union approved the Directive 2003/30/EC in 2003, in response to the rising \n\nconcerns regarding climate change and the highly volatile international oil prices. This Directive introduced a \n\nblending mandate for all member countries, which were required to guarantee that a minimum share of biofuels was \n\nsold on their domestic market. Furthermore, in 2004, there was a change in the German tax policy, allowing full tax \n\nexemption for biofuels blended with conventional fossil fuels. This stimulated the production and consumption of \n\nbiodiesel in the country and increased the share of renewable fuels in transportation.  \n\nAfterwards, however, the situation in Germany changed significantly. In 2007, due to the high weight that \n\nthe tax exemption was imposing on the national budget, it was eliminated by the government and replaced by quota \n\nobligations and tax discounts with the introduction of the Energy Tax Law in 2006 and the Biofuel Quota Law in \n\n2007. These changes in the legislation resulted in an immediate decrease in the production of biofuels in the country. \n\nAccording to Pires and Schechtman (2010), the German biodiesel production decreased by 12% between 2007 and \n\n2008. The idle capacity of the production plants reached 85% and half of the companies involved in the biodiesel \n\nsector had to exit the market due to financial difficulties. These changes that occurred in the German biofuel \n\nlegislation distorted the domestic market and the price transmission observed during the first sub-period disappeared \n\nafter 2008. Moreover, the highly fluctuating EUR/USD exchange rate after the financial crisis might have introduced \n\nadditional turbulence to the German biofuel-related sectors, distorting the long-term relationship between the \n\nexamined prices. \n\n \n\n3.5.3. Comparison of the results  \n\nComparing the results of the estimated models for the three countries of interest during the entire \n\nanalyzed period, it can be observed that only in Brazil all variables of interest adjusted in the long-run. In the U.S., \n\njust the price of gasoline was found to adjust towards the long-term equilibrium, while for Germany no long-term \n\nrelationship was found between the price series. This result is rather in line with the expected, since Brazil has the \n\nmost developed biofuel sector from the three countries of interest, characterized by the wide use of ethanol \n\nproduced from sugarcane in its pure form as substitute for gasoline, which implies tighter relation between the prices \n\nof the examined commodities.  \n\nRegarding the short-term interactions between the variables during the entire analyzed period, the \n\nobtained results show that in the U.S. and in Germany the biofuel price was significantly influenced by the prices of \n\nits fossil fuel alternative and the main feedstock for its production, while, for the case of Brazil, the price of ethanol \n\nwas found to be rather independent in the short-term, indicating the self-sufficiency of the biofuel industry in this \n\ncountry. In addition, both in Brazil and in the U.S., the price of gasoline was significantly affected by the domestic \n\nprice of ethanol, while for Germany, the results indicate that biodiesel did not have a significant impact on the price \n\nof its fossil fuel alternative, thus, implying a significant degree of endogeneity of the biofuel sector in this country.  \n\nThe obtained results for the two sub-periods indicate that the relationship between the biofuel-related \n\nsectors changed after the financial crisis of 2008 in the three examined countries. This change can be attributed to a \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nnumber of factors characterizing the period between 2009 and 2016, such as turbulent exchange rates, increasing \n\ninternational commodity prices, highly volatile international crude oil prices, and changes in the domestic biofuel \n\npolicies. The findings for Brazil and the U.S. show that after the crisis the long-term relationship between the price \n\nseries strengthened significantly.  \n\nIn Germany, on the other hand, both the short- and the long-term transmission between the variables \n\nfrom the first sub-period disappeared after 2008, which is a result of the changes in the country\u2019s government policy \n\nregarding biofuels. This finding is rather important, since it shows how crucial the government support is for the \n\ndevelopment of the German biofuel sector and it indicates that policies play a significant role when it comes to price \n\ntransmission in the biofuel-related sectors. Although similar policy changes were observed in the U.S. after 2008, \n\nwith the expiration of the tax credit and the import tariffs on ethanol in 2011, the relationship between the biofuel-\n\nrelated prices in this country remained rather strong and stable. As pointed out by Kristoufek, Janda and Zilberman \n\n(2012), however, the biofuel-related policies in the U.S. and in Germany are rather different. In Germany, for \n\ninstance, there is no well-defined blending mandate and policy makers have relied mainly on tax exemption and tax \n\ncredits in order to stimulate the production and use of biofuels, while in Brazil and in the U.S. there exist well \n\ndefined blending mandates, which provide additional stimulus for the development of the domestic biofuel industry.  \n\nRegarding the relationship between the examined variables in the short-run, it is important to mention \n\nthat in Brazil the price transmission between the price series increased significantly after 2008. Before the crisis, both \n\ngasoline and sugar were found to be exogenous in the short-run, while afterwards the sugar price entered the \n\ntransmission mechanism, becoming significantly affected by the prices of the other two commodities. In the U.S., on \n\nthe other hand, fewer short-term adjustment coefficient were found to be statistically significant after 2008, with the \n\nprice of corn remaining highly exogenous during both sub-periods. These findings reflect the different position the \n\nmain feedstock for the production of ethanol has in the two examined countries. In Brazil, the price of sugar is \n\ntightly linked to the domestic biofuel industry, while in the U.S. the price of corn appears to be rather independent \n\nand influenced mainly by trends on the international market. \n\nThe most noticeable difference between the two sub-periods, however, was found for Germany, where \n\nafter 2008 none of the estimated short-term coefficients were statistically different than zero. Thus, while in Brazil \n\nand in the U.S. the biofuel-related sectors became more tightly linked after the financial crisis, the opposite was \n\nobserved for the German market. This finding can be attributed to the fact that there is no single feedstock used for \n\nthe production of biodiesel in Germany. In general, the feedstocks for the production of biofuels in the EU differ by \n\nregion. Rapeseed oil and sunflower oil are the most common, but soybean oil and palm oil are used for this purpose, \n\nas well. In recent years, the use of palm oil as biofuel feedstock has become widely spread in the EU mainly because \n\nof its price discounts (FLACH, et al., 2014). This trend might have shaken the position of rapeseed oil as major \n\nfeedstock in Germany and disturbed the link it had with the biofuel sector before the crisis years.  \n\nThe lack of a single feedstock in Germany results in a different relationship between the biofuel-related \n\nprices in the country, reflecting that the domestic biodiesel sector is not tightly dependent on the rapeseed oil price \u2013 \n\na result similar to what was found by Filip et al. (2016). In contrast, when the industry depends on a single feedstock \n\nfor the biofuel production, this creates strong dependence between the prices of the input and the final product. \n\nUnfavorable climate conditions can influence the harvest and the crop of the main feedstock, and without an \n\nalternative, the supply of biofuel might suffer, which can affect significantly its final price. In Germany the high \n\nsubstitutability of different feedstocks justifies the lack of a tight price relationship between the biofuel-related \n\nsectors. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n3.6. Conclusion \n\nThe main objective of the present study is to verify if there exist differences in the biofuel-related price \n\ntransmission mechanisms in Brazil, in the United States and in Germany, with emphasis on the specific \n\ncharacteristics of the biofuel and fuel sectors and the varying government policies regarding these industries in the \n\nthree countries of interest. The performed time series analysis focuses on using data with the same frequency, level \n\nand time frame for the three economies in order to complement the existing literature with a comparative analysis of \n\nthe relationships between the biofuel prices, their main fuel alternative and their major feedstock. The analysis is \n\nperformed for two separate time periods, which account for the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008.  \n\nThe obtained results show that the relationship between the biofuel-related sectors is different in the three \n\nexamined countries. For Brazil, the ethanol, gasoline and sugar prices were found to adjust towards the long-term \n\nequilibrium when the entire sample is considered, while in the U.S. only the price of gasoline participated in the long-\n\nterm adjustment process. For Germany, on the other hand, no evidence for a long-term relationship between the \n\nvariables was found, which implies less dependent biofuel-related sectors in this country.  \n\nFurthermore, the analysis for the two sub-periods shows that the price transmission between the biofuel-\n\nrelated sectors in the three countries changed significantly after the financial crisis. In Brazil, the examined price \n\nseries became more integrated after 2008, with gasoline and sugar prices joining the long-term adjustment process. \n\nFor the U.S. market, the estimated results show that the price series exhibited a long-term cointegration relationship \n\nafter the crisis period, which was not observed between 2005 and 2008. The price of corn, however, remained \n\nexogenous during both sub-periods, implying that the relationship between the main feedstock and the domestic \n\nbiofuel sector in the U.S. is rather different than the existing tight link between ethanol and sugar prices in Brazil.  \n\n The situation in Germany, however, is rather different than what was found for the other two examined \n\ncountries. While the prices of biodiesel, diesel and rapeseed oil were tightly related between 2005 and 2008, after the \n\ncrisis neither short- nor long-run transmission was observed between the three analyzed price series. This result can \n\nbe attributed to the changes in the policy regarding biofuels in the country, as well as to the specific characteristics of \n\nits biofuel-related sectors, which include the existence of alternative feedstocks for biofuel production. While in \n\nBrazil and in the U.S. the industry is characterized by a stable price transmission between the biofuel-related \n\ncommodities, in Germany such a stable link is not observed. \n\nThe main contribution of the present paper lies in the performed comparative analysis which sheds light \n\non the existing differences between the price transmission mechanisms related to biofuels in Brazil, Germany and the \n\nUnited States. The findings of the study contribute to the existing discussion regarding biofuel policies by stressing \n\nthe fact that price transmission depends significantly on the specific characteristics of the domestic biofuel industry \n\nas well as on the government policies regarding this fuel alternative.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nABBOTT, P.

HYPOTHETICAL EFFECTS OF FREE GASOLINE PRICES ON THE ETHANOL \n\nSECTOR IN THE STATE OF S\u00c3O PAULO \n\nABSTRACT \n\nBrazil is a particularly interesting country when it comes to the study of fuel prices and their \neffects on the domestic economy, since the oil-related sectors have some specific characteristics, such \nas the wide use of ethanol as a substitute for gasoline and the practiced fuel pricing policy by the \ngovernment. The goal of the present study is to analyze how the situation in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo \nwould have looked like between 2007 and 2016 if fuel prices were not administrated by the \ngovernment and what the hypothetical effects of such a change in the government fuel pricing policy \nwould have been on biofuel prices and demand. For the purposes of the analysis, a hypothetical \nconsumer gasoline price was constructed, using the provided by DATAGRO \u201cinterned\u201d gasoline \nprice series. The fuel demand elasticities were estimated by fitting a structural VEC model to the data. \nThe obtained results show that gasoline prices that incorporate the price fluctuations on the \ninternational crude oil market would have led to higher hydrous ethanol prices in the state of S\u00e3o \nPaulo, making it more profitable for sugarcane producers to engage into the production of ethanol \ninstead of sugar. Moreover, gasoline prices without government intervention would have caused lower \ndemand for this type of fuel, breaking the artificial demand created by the practiced fuel pricing policy. \nThese findings show that the ethanol sector could have benefitted from a freely fluctuating gasoline \nprices, especially between 2011 and 2014 when the industry faced a severe crisis. There is a need for \nreformulating the practiced fuel pricing policy in Brazil in order to help ethanol regain its previous \ncompetitiveness as a substitute for conventional fossil fuels and to reestablish itself in the country\u2019s \nenergy matrix. \n\nKeywords: Fuel pricing policy; Free fuel prices; Ethanol; Demand estimation \n\n \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nCrude oil and conventional fossil fuels remain the main energy source worldwide. They are internationally \n\ntraded goods and their prices are formed following the basic rules of supply and demand on the world market. \n\nNevertheless, the prices of fuels in some countries do not follow the international price of crude oil, but rather \n\ndiverge significantly. This trend is the result of two main factors that play a role simultaneously: government fuel \n\npricing policies and taxation. In general, fuel price fluctuations are considered to have a significant negative impact \n\non inflation rates, especially in developing countries, which is the main reason why governments adopt different fuel \n\npricing mechanisms which involve some degree of intervention in the formation of the domestic fuel price.  \n\nThe case of Brazil is particularly interesting when it comes to the study of fuel prices and their effects on \n\nother sectors of the economy, since the oil-related industry in the country has some specific characteristics, such as \n\nthe wide use of ethanol produced from sugarcane as a substitute for gasoline and the practiced fuel pricing policy by \n\nthe government. Until 1997, the state-controlled company Petrobras held a monopoly on all oil-related activities in \n\nthe country, fuel imports were not allowed and the price of all petroleum derivatives was established by the \n\ngovernment. Moreover, the price of ethanol was artificially established and kept at 60% of the domestic price of \n\ngasoline (FARINA et al., 2010). In the late 1990s, the first steps towards the liberalization of the fuel industry were \n\ntaken: the sector was opened for competition, subsidies were removed, and the refinery price was liberalized. This \n\nprocess was effectively completed in 2002 and currently there is no official government control over the fuel sector.  \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nNevertheless, fuel prices in Brazil are not entirely free to follow international crude oil price fluctuations. \n\nThe ex-refinery price of all petroleum derivatives is set by Petrobras, which uses as a reference for the price \n\nadjustments the variations in the Brent crude oil price and the USD exchange rate published by the Central Bank of \n\nBrazil. The established pricing system in the country aims at diminishing the negative effects that volatile fuel prices \n\nwould have on the inflation rate. Thus, Petrobras plays the role of a price-setter and assists the Brazilian government \n\nby ensuring that the supply and the price of petroleum derivatives in the country meet the consumption \n\nrequirements (FATTOUH; OLIVEIRA; SEN, 2015). Another measure used by the government as a way to control \n\ndomestic fuel prices is taxation, which has been frequently adjusted in order to maintain the price of fuels stable in \n\ntimes of expensive international crude oil.  \n\nThis pricing policy has been an important decision for the government, since the country has a history of \n\nperiods with extremely high inflation. Moreover, in Brazil the distribution system of goods relies mainly on road \n\ntransportation, which implies that higher fuel prices will be passed on to the final consumer price of goods, since the \n\nmajority is transported by trucks. In 2014, for instance, more than half of all goods transported was carried by road \n\n(CUNHA, 2015). The inadequate infrastructure for using cheaper types of transportation makes the country \n\ndependent on road transport and almost all sectors of the economy become vulnerable to fuel price fluctuations.   \n\nThe practiced pricing policy in Brazil resulted in a significant divergence of the domestic fuel prices from \n\nthe international price of crude oil, as shown on figure 15. As it can be observed on the graph, the domestic monthly \n\naverage consumer prices of gasoline and diesel remained rather stable during the period between 2005 and 2016, \n\nwith small and insignificant adjustments occurring mainly after 2012. According to Fattouh, Oliveira and Sen (2015), \n\nthe gasoline price has been adjusted 12 times in the last 11 years, while the diesel price \u2013 14 times. The Europe Brent \n\nprice, on the other hand, measured in R$/barrel, varied significantly between 2005 and 2015. These fluctuations on \n\nthe international oil market, however, were not absorbed by the gasoline and diesel prices in Brazil. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 15. Monthly average consumer prices of gasoline C and diesel for Brazil and Europe Brent crude oil price \nbetween January, 2005 and January, 2016 \n\nSource: NPA, EIA. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nIn general, ad hoc fuel pricing policies, as the one existing in Brazil, lower the vulnerability of the \n\ndomestic market to outside oil price shocks, but they can also have severe consequences for the domestic economy. \n\nArtificially low domestic petroleum product prices in times of expensive international crude oil can lead to financial \n\ndifficulties for fuel suppliers and importers, fuel supply shortages and lack of investment in the fuel sector \n\n(KOJIMA, 2009). For the specific case of Brazil, the artificially established petroleum product prices have brought \n\nimbalances to the domestic economy and especially to Petrobras (SERIGATI, 2014). The profitability of the \n\ncompany has deteriorated significantly, which, in turn, has undermined the value of its shares and increased its \n\nindebtedness. Between 2011 and 2014 Petrobras lost over 23 billion BRL by importing gasoline, diesel and LPG at \n\nhigher prices than it was selling domestically and its debt increased by 70% (OLIVEIRA; ALMEIDA, 2015).  \n\n Other sectors of the economy, especially the ethanol industry, suffered as well in the past few years. The \n\nprevailing trend of the consumers\u2019 preference for ethanol as a result of the introduction of the flex-fuel vehicle in \n\n2003 was reversed in 2009, due to the artificially low gasoline price established by Petrobras. The attractiveness of \n\nthe ethanol sector reduced, pushing away investors and leading to migration to sugar production from sugarcane \n\ninstead of ethanol. In general, Brazil has a major international comparative advantage in the production of ethanol \n\nand large domestic demand potential, which can be activated once the price of the product becomes competitive \n\nwhen compared to gasoline (ARAUJO, 2013). Keeping the price of fuels artificially low, however, undermined the \n\ncompetitiveness of the biofuel sector in recent years and the potential of this fuel alternative weakened significantly.  \n\nThe negative consequences of the established pricing policy in Brazil raise some fundamental questions: \n\nWho is covering the losses of Petrobras and is the burden transferred to the final consumer? Should the government \n\nlet the price of fuels adjust to international crude oil price fluctuations? What would the potential impact of such a \n\npricing policy be on the domestic economy and especially on the ethanol sector? These important questions have not \n\nbeen answered yet, thus, the study of how the situation in Brazil would look like if fuel prices were not administrated \n\nand what their level would have been during the past decade, represents a relevant topic of research, which is \n\naddressed in the present paper.  \n\nThe main objective of this work is to provide insights on the issue by examining the hypothetical effects \n\nof a change in the government fuel pricing policy in Brazil on the fuel and biofuel prices and demands in the state of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo for the period January, 2007 - June, 2016. For this purpose, a hypothetical freely fluctuation consumer \n\ngasoline price was constructed, using the provided by DATAGRO series of \u201cinterned\u201d gasoline A price. The \n\nproposed method for performing the analysis is based on fitting a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to \n\nthe data that incorporates the specific characteristics of the fuel and biofuel sectors in the country, in order to \n\nestimate the price elasticities of ethanol and gasoline demand. The estimated contemporaneous responses of the \n\nvariables to changes in the price of gasoline are used afterwards for the calculation of the hypothetical ethanol price \n\nfor a scenario with no government intervention in the domestic fuel sector and the consecutive effects on the \n\ndemanded quantities of ethanol and gasoline.  \n\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows: Section 4.2 briefly reviews the literature on fuel \n\npricing policy and ethanol demand estimation in Brazil; Section 4.3 focuses on the methodology for performing the \n\nanalysis; Section 4.4 develops the theoretical model applied in the paper and describes the used data; Section 4.5 \n\npresents the results of the research; Section 4.6 concludes with final remarks and suggestions for future research. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n4.2. Literature Review \n\n4.2.1. Fuel pricing policy and simulation of free fuel prices \n\nThere is no consensus in the existing literature whether the Brazilian government should move to a fuel \n\npricing policy, which allows the prices of petroleum derivatives to be determined entirely by the market, or not. \n\nSome authors (VIEGAS, 2011) argue that the total liberalization of the price of gasoline is essential for the country, \n\nespecially for the ethanol industry, while others (OLIVEIRA; ALMEIDA, 2015; ALMEIDA; OLIVEIRA; \n\nLOSEKANN, 2015) think that a market-based approach for fuel prices is unfeasible. The majority of the reviewed \n\nworks, however, conclude that a change in the practiced fuel pricing mechanism in Brazil is essential for the country.  \n\nAlmeida, Oliveira and Losekann (2015), for instance, perform a comparative analysis of internationally \n\npracticed fuel pricing policies and their application for Brazil. The authors conclude that the full liberalization of fuel \n\nprices, as in Canada and the United States, is not the best option for a country like Brazil, which has great concerns \n\nof the impacts of international price variations on the level of inflation. Thus, some level of government control is \n\nneeded and a policy of stabilization funds, such as the practiced in Chile and Peru, appears to be the better option \n\nfor Brazil.  \n\nAccording to Azevedo and Serigati (2015), the adopted strategy by the government of the President \n\nDilma Rouseff of administrating prices as an instrument for reducing inflation in Brazil has been inefficient, has had \n\nnegative impacts on investment and consumption decisions, and, in addition, has been used as a strategy for winning \n\nelections. The authors propose two alternative policies. The first one establishes clear and transparent rules for price \n\nadjustments, whose change represents a cost for the government in office, in order to limit its power and reduce any \n\nkind of abuse. The second option is removing the administrated prices from the composition of the inflation index \n\nIPCA, which will change the motives of the government when exercising control on price levels.  \n\nThe negative effects of the practiced fuel pricing policy in Brazil on the ethanol sector have received \n\nattention in the existing literature, as well. Santos, Garcia and Shikida (2015), for instance, discuss the main factors \n\nthat led to the crisis of the ethanol sector in the country from 2011, namely, the elevation of the production costs, \n\nthe increase in the costs for external financing, the reduction in the margins, and the control of the price of gasoline. \n\nThe authors raise the question of the potential effects of liberalization of the price of gasoline on the ethanol sector \n\nin the country and suggest this research question as an interesting continuation of their work.  \n\nWhen it comes to the potential impact of free fuel prices in Brazil on the ethanol industry, Araujo (2013) \n\nanalyzes how the variation of the price of gasoline in the country affects the performance of the ethanol sector. The \n\nauthor estimates the GDP of the sugar and ethanol industries for the period 2002-2012, using the actual gasoline \n\nprices for the studied period and a benchmark price of gasoline of the Gulf of North America. The obtained results \n\nshow the existence of significant impact of the gasoline price on all variables of the biofuel industry in Brazil, which \n\ninclude production of hydrous and anhydrous ethanol, GDP of the sugar and ethanol sectors, and indebtedness of \n\nthe industry. The article provides evidence that the fuel pricing policy of the government has negative impact not \n\nonly on the performance of Petrobras, but also on the performance of all sugar and ethanol-related sectors in the \n\ncountry. \n\nA simulation of free gasoline price for Brazil was performed by Serigati (2014), who used two different \n\napproaches. The first originates in the calculation of a viable price of hydrous ethanol, from which the price of \n\ngasoline is derived, assuming that the effective price ratio of 0.7 between the two prices is maintained. The second \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\none is based on a simulation of an average gasoline price following the variations in the international crude oil price \n\nfrom where the arbitrary fair price of ethanol is derived. Serigati (2014) concludes that the policy of controlling fuel \n\nprices has decreased the competitiveness of ethanol over time but at the same time has helped control inflation. \n\nMore thorough analysis of the potential effects of free fuel prices on the inflation rate in Brazil was \n\nperformed by Corr\u00eaa and Teixeira (2014). The authors used U.S. gasoline and diesel prices as a proxy for free fuel \n\nprices in Brazil, in order to calculate the historical IPCA for the hypothetical situation of no government intervention \n\nin the fuel sector for the period 2003-2008. The authors do not find any significant hypothetical negative impact on \n\nthe index of inflation. The obtained results show that only in 2003 and in 2008 the inflation rate would have been \n\nhigher due to the free prices of gasoline and diesel in comparison to the actually observed rate of inflation in the \n\ncountry.  \n\nFurthermore, Cunha (2015) developed a method for analyzing the direct and indirect effects of \n\nadministrated fuel prices on the inflation index in Brazil for the period 2005-2013. The obtained results show that \n\nthe policy of controlling fuel prices was successful for mitigating the level of inflation in some of the studied years, \n\nbut at the same time was associated with social costs and economic distortions related to this type of pricing policy. \n\nMoreover, Cunha (2015) emphasizes the negative effects of the practiced fuel pricing policy in the country, indicating \n\nthe distortions in the domestic price system, the deterioration of Petrobras\u2019 financial situation, the reduced \n\nattractiveness of the oil-related sector for investment, the negative impact on the ethanol sector and the \n\nenvironmental costs. The proposed alternative policy by the author is the adoption of a measure of core inflation as \n\nan official index, which is supposed to exhibit less variation than the plain inflation index and, thus, can serve as a \n\nbetter signal for adopting different economic policies.  \n\nKhanna, Nunez and Zilberman (2016) develop a partial-equilibrium model of the fuel, biofuel, and sugar \n\nsectors in Brazil in order to analyze the impacts of the practiced fuel policies in the country. The authors simulate \n\nfive alternative policy scenarios and compare their hypothetical effects on the prices and the demanded and supplied \n\nquantities of sugar, ethanol and gasoline. The main findings show that the status-quo policy scenario that considers \n\nthe existing mix of policies, including blending mandate, gasoline tax, ethanol tax credit and oil price cap, leads to \n\nhigher consumer fuel and biofuel prices, higher production and consumption of ethanol, lower sugar supply and \n\ngasoline demand, in comparison to the baseline scenario of no policy. Moreover, the authors conclude that the \n\nchoice of fuel policies in Brazil has not been guided by the pursuit of economic efficiency, but rather by policy \n\nobjectives such as tax revenue, increasing oil exports, and the well-being of various interest groups.  \n\nAnalysis of the impacts of the practiced fuel pricing policy in Brazil on the price of ethanol has been \n\nperformed by Costa and Burnquist (2016). They use annual data for the period 2006-2015 for the estimation of a \n\nfreely fluctuating gasoline price based on the import price of this commodity. The authors find that between 2006 \n\nand 2010, as well as in 2015, the observed ethanol and gasoline prices in Brazil were approximately 10% higher than \n\nthe simulated prices without government intervention, while between 2010 and 2014 the simulated prices were found \n\nto be 7% above the observed ones. The obtained results show that the government intervention in the domestic fuel \n\nsector has at certain periods stimulated the consumption of biofuels and at other periods it has discouraged ethanol \n\ndemand. The authors, however, do not examine the effects of the total liberalization of the domestic fuel sector on \n\nthe demanded fuel and biofuel quantities.  \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Price transmission in the biofuel-related sectors and ethanol demand \n\nestimation \n\nFor the purposes of the proposed study, it is crucial to understand the interrelations between the ethanol \n\nsector and the sugar and gasoline markets in Brazil. Moreover, it is important to take into consideration the existing \n\nlink between the hydrous and anhydrous ethanol markets. First of all, sugar and ethanol in Brazil are produced from \n\nthe same feedstock \u2013 sugarcane, which makes the two products competing on the supply side. Since most of the \n\nproduction plants in the country are specialized in producing both products, it is up to the producer to decide how \n\nto distribute its production, depending on market conditions. This specific characteristic of the sugar and ethanol \n\nsectors makes them closely interrelated, especially when it comes to price linkages. The findings of the empirical \n\nliterature provide evidence for the existence of a long-term relationship between the prices of sugar and ethanol in \n\nBrazil (RAPSOMANIKIS; HALLAM, 2006; BALCOMBE; RAPSOMANIKIS, 2008; BLOCK; CORONEL; \n\nVELOSO, 2012; BENTIVOGLIO; FINCO; BACCHI, 2016). \n\nAnother important characteristic of the Brazilian biofuel sector is the fact that there are two types of \n\nethanol produced in the country \u2013 hydrous ethanol, which is used in its pure form as a substitute for gasoline, and \n\nanhydrous ethanol, which is derived after dehydration and is used only for blending with gasoline. Since the latter is a \n\nderivation of the former, the prices of the two products are highly interrelated (ELOBEID; TOKGOZ, 2008).  \n\nWhen it comes to the relationship between hydrous ethanol and gasoline in Brazil, the two products act as \n\nsubstitutes on the demand side due to the existence of the flex-fuel vehicle, introduced in 2003, which allows the \n\nconsumer to choose what fuel to use \u2013 gasoline C (a blend of gasoline with 27% of anhydrous ethanol) or pure \n\nhydrous ethanol fuel. Since ethanol is less efficient than gasoline, it makes sense to use the biofuel as a substitute as \n\nlong as its price constitutes 70% of the price of gasoline. This specific characteristic of the fuel and biofuel sectors, \n\nwhich is rather unique for Brazil, implies that they are closely interrelated. The results of the existing empirical \n\nliterature on the topic show that there exists a long-term relationship between the prices of hydrous ethanol and \n\ngasoline in the country (CAVALCANTI; SZKLO; MACHADO, 2011; BENTIVOGLIO; FINCO; BACCHI, 2016).  \n\nEthanol demand estimation in Brazil has been a relevant research topic since the introduction of the flex-\n\nfuel vehicle in 2003, which made it possible for the consumer to choose between gasoline and ethanol as fuel \n\nalternatives. Table 10 provides synthesized information on the estimated ethanol demand elasticities in the empirical \n\nliterature for Brazil. In the majority of reviewed studies on the topic, ethanol consumption is used as dependent \n\nvariable, while various independent variables, such as own price and the price of the main substitute, income and \n\nvehicle fleet, are included in the estimation of the equation for ethanol demand. Three major methodology \n\napproaches can be distinguished in the examined literature \u2013 time series analysis based on cointegration and vector \n\nerror-correction model (VECM) estimation; least-squares (OLS) regression estimation; and spatial panel model \n\nestimation.  \n\nAs it can be seen from table 10, the estimated own price elasticities of ethanol demand from all of the \n\nreviewed studies have a negative sign, reflecting the rules of the Law of Demand, while the estimated cross-price \n\nelasticities have a positive sign, implying that ethanol and gasoline act as substitutes. The estimated own short-term \n\nprice elasticities remain in the range between 0.55 and 1.96, while in the long-run this range is between 1.11 and \n\n11.26 in absolute terms, indicating that ethanol demand is more sensitive to its own price changes in the long-run \n\n(PONTES, 2009; RANDOW; FONTES; CARMINATI, 2010; SANTOS; FARIA, 2012; CARDOSO; \n\nBITTENCOURT; PORSSE, 2013). Similar conclusions can be derived for the cross-price elasticity with gasoline: \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\nthe estimated values are higher in the long than in the short-run, implying higher substitutability between the two \n\nfuel alternatives in the long-run. Moreover, the results of the reviewed studies show that ethanol demand is more \n\nsensitive to changes in the price of gasoline than to its own price variations.  \n\nThere is a consensus in the literature that after the introduction of the flex-fuel vehicle in 2003, ethanol \n\nstrengthened its position as a fuel and as a substitute for conventional fossil fuels (FREITAS; KANEKO, 2011; \n\nSERIGATI; CORREIA; PEROSA, 2010), which led to an increase in price and cross-price elasticities of the demand \n\nfor this type of biofuel (SOUZA, 2010). In addition, ethanol demand is found to be more income elastic and more \n\nsensitive to changes in the vehicle fleet than gasoline demand (PONTES, 2009; CARDOSO; BITTENCOURT; \n\nPORSSE, 2013). \n\n \n\nTable 10.

There exists no \n\nconsensus on whether the government should adopt a market-oriented fuel pricing policy or not, but the majority of \n\nresearchers point out the necessity of a new pricing mechanism that is more transparent, does not allow abuse by the \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\ngovernment, and does not have significant negative impact on the domestic economy, and especially on the ethanol \n\nsector.  \n\n \n\n4.3. Methodology  \n\n4.3.1. Stationarity tests \n\nThis study relies on time series techniques for performing the analysis, which requires taking into account \n\nsome general statistical properties of the time series data a priori (SERRA; ZILBERMAN, 2013). The first property \n\nto be considered is the stationarity of the examined variables. Stationary data is characterized by time-constancy of its \n\nstatistical distribution and such a time series is considered to be a process integrated of order zero - I(0). \n\nCommon practices in time series modelling involve the application of the augmented Dickey-Fuller and \n\nthe Phillips-Perron tests for determining whether a data series is stationary or not. The proposed by Elliott, \n\nRothenberg and Stock (1996) DF-GLS test, however, has significantly greater power and better overall performance \n\nin terms of small-sample sizes, dominating the ordinary Dickey-Fuller tests (HATANAKA, 1996). This test \n\nrepresents a modified version of the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, in which the series has been transformed by a \n\ngeneralized least-squares regression. The DF-GLS test is performed fitting a regression of the following form \n\n(ELLIOTT; ROTHENBERG; STOCK, 1996): \n\n?? =  ? + ????? + ?? + ?? ????? + ??????? + ? + ?? ?????  + ??      (4.1) \n\nwhere k is the number of lags of first-differenced, detrended variables. The number of lags of the process \n\nhas to be chosen appropriately. Lags should be added to the model only until they are significant, i.e. until there is no \n\nserial correlation in the error term. For this purpose, information criteria like the Ng-Perron, the Schwarz Criterion \n\nand the Modified Akaike Information Criterion are used. \n\nThere are two forms of the DF-GLS test \u2013 GLS detrending (where the series to be tested is regressed on \n\na constant and a linear trend) and GLS demeaning (where only a constant appears in the first-stage regression). The \n\nnull hypothesis of the DF-GLS test assumes that the ??  is a random walk. There are two alternative hypotheses \n\ndepending on the chosen form of the test: ??  is stationary about a linear time trend, and ??  is stationary with a \n\npossible nonzero mean but with no linear time trend. \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Structural vector autoregression (SVAR) \n\nA vector autoregression process of a vector ??  containing n variables with p-lags can be expressed in the \n\nfollowing form (HAMILTON, 1994): \n\n?? =  ? + ?????? + ?????? + ? + ?????? + ??    (4.2) \n\nwhere ??  is a vector of stationary variables whose interrelations are analyzed, c denotes an (n x 1) vector of \n\nconstants, ??  is an (n x n) matrix of autoregressive coefficients and ?? is a vector of independent and identically \n\ndistributed (i.i.d.) error terms with variance-covariance matrix ?.  \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nA structural vector autoregression is a VAR(p) process subject to short- or long-run restrictions placed on \n\nthe contemporaneous relations in the VAR system, based on economic theory. According to Hamilton (1994) an \n\nSVAR representation of equation (4.2) takes the following form: \n\n???? =  ? + ?? ???? + ?????? + ? + ?????? + ??    (4.3) \n\nwhere ?? is an (n x n) matrix of contemporaneous relationships between the variables, ?? \u2019s are (n x n) \n\nmatrices of coefficients, and  ??  is an (n x 1) vector of structural innovations.  \n\nAssuming that ?? is invertible, equation (4.3) can be multiplied by ??\n?? on the left and solved for \n\n?? , which results in the following reduced form of the SVAR: \n\n?? =  ??\n??? + ??\n\n???? ???? + ??\n???? ???? + ? + ??\n\n???????? + ??\n????    (4.4) \n\nEquation (4.4) represents the short-term SVAR form, where the imposed restrictions on the ?? matrix \n\nmodel the contemporaneous relationships between the variables. Moreover, for the identification of the SVAR \n\nmodel, an orthogonality restriction should be imposed on the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals (?). This \n\nmatrix should be diagonal, implying that the covariances between the residuals is restricted to be zero. The \n\nestimation of the coefficients of the SVAR model is based on maximum likelihood method of estimation.  \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Cointegration and SVECM \n\nAnother time series property that is tested in this work is the existence of a long-term relationship among \n\nthe variables, or the so called cointegration. The formal development of this key concept was done by the Nobel \n\nlaureates Clive Granger and Robert Engle (ENGLE; GRANGER, 1987). A vector time series ??  is said to be \n\ncointegrated if its individual elements are nonstationary but there exists a stationary linear combination of them - \n\n???? , for some nonzero vector ? called cointegration vector (HAMILTON, 1994). More precisely, the existence of \n\ncointegration implies that even though some permanent changes in the elements of ??  may occur, these elements are \n\ntied by the equilibrium relationship ????  and tend to return to it in the long-run.  \n\nThe proposed by Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) cointegration test is based on a vector \n\nautoregression (VAR) model with p lags of a nonstationary n-dimensional process integrated of order one with \n\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian errors. The authors derive the maximum likelihood estimator \n\nof the cointegration vectors and perform a likelihood ratio test for the hypothesis that there exists a given number of \n\ncointegration vectors. \n\nIf the results of the cointegration test point towards the existence of a long-term relationship between the \n\nvariables of the vector ?? , then the VAR model in equation (4.2) cannot be used to fit the data. Instead, an error-\n\ncorrection feature should be added to the VAR, which accounts for the existence of a cointegration relationship \n\nbetween the variables. Such a model is called a vector error-correction model (VECM). VEC models are useful tools \n\nin time series, since they allow the direct estimation of the speed at which a dependent variable returns to its long-\n\nterm equilibrium after a change in an independent variable. These models account not only for long-term \n\nrelationships, but also for short-term interactions between the variables. The VECM representation of the VAR \n\nmodel in equation (4.2) without constant and without a deterministic trend takes the following form \n\n(LUTKEPOHL, 2005): \n\n \n\n??? =  ??????? + ??????? + ? + ??????????? + ????? +  ??      (4.5) \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\n?? =  ? ? + ?? + ? + ?? ,   i= 1,2,\u2026 ,? ? 1 (4.6) \n\nThus, the matrix ? is a function of ? (? =  ? ?? ) and consists of the coefficients that measure the long-\n\nterm adjustments of the variables, while the ? matrix contains the coefficients that measure the adjustments of the \n\nmodel in the short-run.  \n\nThe rank of the matrix ? can be used to test for the existence and the number of cointegration vectors. If \n\n ????(?) = 0, this means that there is no cointegration between the variables and a traditional VAR model can be \n\nused to examine their relationship. If ????(?) = ?, i.e. the matrix has a full rank, then the variables cannot be I(1), \n\nimplying that ??  is a stationary process. Finally, if 0&lt;????(?) = ? &lt;?, then the variables are cointegrated and the \n\nnumber of cointegration vectors is equal to the rank r. Consequently, there exist two (n x r) matrices - ? and ?, such \n\nthat ? = ???, where the the ?\u2019s are the cointegration vectors and the linear combination ????  is stationary, while the \n\nmatrix ? contains information on the speed of adjustment of the variables in the long-run. In this case, the \n\napplication of the VAR model is inappropriate, and ??  can be interpreted as an error-correction model. \n\nIn order to test the hypothesis that there are at most r cointegration vectors, Johansen (1988) and \n\nJohansen and Juselius (1990) apply a likelihood ratio test where the null hypothesis being tested is the following: \n\n??:????(?) ? ? ?? ? = ???  (4.7) \n\nThe VEC model presented in equation (4.5) does not include assumptions from economic theory and can \n\nbe considered the reduced form of a structural VEC model which incorporates restrictions based on theory. A \n\nstructural VEC model (SVECM) without deterministic trend and exogenous variables takes the following form \n\n(LUTKEPOHL, 2005): \n\n???? =  ??\n?????? + ??\n\n?????? + ? + ????\n? ??????? + ?\n\n????? +  ???      (4.8) \n\nThe matrix of contemporaneous effects A allows the incorporation of a structure reflecting a theoretical \n\nmodel in the VECM. For the estimation of the structural form parameters of the model, restrictions should be \n\nimposed on the matrix of contemporaneous effects. The estimation of the SVECM is done using maximum \n\nlikelihood estimation.  \n\n \n\n4.4. Theoretical model and data description \n\nFor the purposes of the present study, a slightly modified version of the theoretical model developed by \n\nDiehl (2012) is used as the basis for the estimation of the price elasticities of ethanol and gasoline demand. This \n\ntheoretical model captures the specific characteristics of the fuel and biofuel sectors in Brazil and consists of the \n\nfollowing nine equations: \n\n1. Hydrous ethanol demand: \n\n???,? =  ?? +  ?????,? + ????,? + ???? + ???? + ??,?   (4.9) \n\n2. Domestic consumer price of hydrous ethanol: \n\n???,? =  ?? +  ????,? + ?????,? + ??,?   (4.10) \n\n3. Gasoline C demand: \n\n??,? =  ?? +  ?????,? + ????,? + ???? + ???? + ??,?   (4.11) \n\n4. Domestic consumer price of gasoline C (exogenous): \n\n??,? =  ??,?   (4.12) \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n5.

International sugar price (exogenous): \n\n???,? =  ??,?   (4.15) \n\n8. Income (exogenous): \n\n?? =  ??,?   (4.16) \n\n9. Flex-fuel vehicle fleet (exogenous): \n\n?? =  ??,?    (4.17) \n\nwhere, ???,?  is the quantity sold of hydrous ethanol at period t; ??,?  is the quantity sold of gasoline C; \n\n???,?  is the consumer price of hydrous ethanol; ??,?  is the consumer price of gasoline C; ???,?  is the domestic \n\nproducer price of anhydrous ethanol; ??,?  is the domestic producer price of sugar; ???,?  is the international price of \n\nsugar; ??  is income; and ??  is the number of alcohol and flex-fuel vehicles in use. \n\nThese nine equations form the matrix of contemporaneous relations between the variables. Equations \n\n(4.9) and (4.11) model the demand for hydrous ethanol and for gasoline C, respectively. The independent variables in \n\nthe demand equations include price of the fuel of interest, price of its substitute, income, and alcohol and flex-fuel \n\nvehicle fleet. In equation (4.10) the independent variable is the consumer price of hydrous ethanol, which is modelled \n\nas a function of the price of gasoline C and the price of anhydrous ethanol, which can be considered a proxy for the \n\nproducer price of ethanol, as pointed out by Elobeid and Tokgoz, (2008).  \n\nMoreover, the developed theoretical model accounts for the formation of the domestic sugar price, which \n\nis modeled as dependent on the international sugar price (equation 4.14), since Brazil is a major player on the \n\ninternational sugar market, implying that its domestic sugar sector is highly influenced by international factors.  \n\nThe domestic sugar price, on the other hand, is considered to influence the domestic producer price of \n\nanhydrous ethanol (equation 4.13), since the two products are derived from the same raw material and are \n\nconsidered competing on the supply side. The consumer price of gasoline, as well as the international price of sugar, \n\nthe income and the vehicle fleet are considered to be exogenous variables in the model.  \n\n \n\nTable 11.

The expected signs of the coefficients are shown in brackets. In the \n\ndemand equations for hydrous ethanol and gasoline C, the expected sign of the coefficient on income is positive. \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nThe price of the respective product is expected to influence the demanded quantities in a negative way, while the \n\nprice of the substitute product is considered to have a positive impact on fuel demand. The alcohol and flex-fuel \n\nvehicle fleet is assumed to have a positive sign in the demand equation for ethanol and to influence negatively the \n\ndemand for gasoline.  \n\nIn the price equation for hydrous ethanol, the expected signs are positive for the effects of changes in \n\nboth the price of gasoline and in the producer price of anhydrous ethanol. In turn, the price of anhydrous ethanol is \n\nconsidered to be positively influenced by the price of sugar, since the two products are competitors on the supply \n\nside. Finally, the international price of sugar is assumed to have a positive effect on the domestic producer price of \n\nthis product.  \n\nAs it can be seen in table 11, the matrix of restrictions presumes that the consumption of fuels is \n\ncontemporaneously influenced by all other relevant variables in the model, but at the same time, it is not considered \n\nto have any contemporaneous impact on the prices included in the system. This structure follows the logics of the \n\nmajority of studies examining fuel demand, which assume that the price variables are exogenous. According to \n\nRodrigues (2015), this way of modelling demand for fuels is based on the fact that domestic fuel prices more often \n\nthan not are subject to government policies and regulations, on the one hand, and are tightly linked to the \n\ninternational price of oil, on the other. In the specific case of Brazil, the ex-refinery price of all crude oil derivatives is \n\nestablished by the state-owned company Petrobras, while the price of ethanol has a ceiling given by the price of \n\ngasoline. These specifics of the fuel and biofuel sectors in the country justify the modelling of the fuel prices as \n\nunaffected by the demanded quantities.  \n\nThe data used for the empirical analysis consists of the following series: \n\n? Hydrous ethanol sales by distributors in liters (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and \n\nBiofuels - NPA); \n\n? Gasoline C sales by distributors in liters (NPA); \n\n? Consumer price of hydrous ethanol in BRL/liter (NPA); \n\n? Consumer price of gasoline C in BRL/liter (NPA); \n\n? Producer price of anhydrous ethanol in BRL/liter (Center for Advanced Studies on Applied \n\nEconomics/\u201cLuiz de Queiroz\u201d College of Agriculture - CEPEA/ESALQ); \n\n? Producer price of sugar in BRL/sack (CEPEA/ESALQ); \n\n? International sugar price \u2013 futures contract for first delivery for Sugar No. 11 converted into \n\nBRL/sack (The New York Stock Exchange - NYSE); \n\n? Real average monthly income in BRL (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE); \n\n? Alcohol and flex-fuel vehicle fleet in units (Brazilian Automotive Industry Yearbook -\n\nANFAVEA). \n\nAll variables are obtained from secondary sources and consist of monthly regional data for the state of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo for the period January, 2007 - July, 2016. In order to make the data comparable for the purposes of the \n\nstudy, all prices were converted into Brazilian currency, using the monthly nominal USD/BRL exchange rate \n\npublished by the Central Bank of Brazil. All price data was transformed into real terms using as a deflator the IGP-di \n\nfor December, 2015, and all volumes were converted to liters. All variables were transformed into log terms, which \n\nallows the interpretation of the estimated coefficients of the SVAR (SVEC) model as elasticities.  \n\nThe simulated free gasoline price was constructed using the provided by DATAGRO series of daily \n\nproducer prices of gasoline A that accompany the fluctuations in the international crude oil price. The company \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\npublishes regularly such a hypothetical free price of fuels in Brazil denoted as \u201cinterned price\u201d. All costs incurred in \n\nimporting fuels to the domestic market are considered. More precisely, the calculation of the \u201cinterned price\u201d for \n\ngasoline is based on the following formula: \n\n \nRBOB Gasoline spot price NYMEX FOB*Exchange rate + trade margin + ocean freight + insurance + \n\ncustoms costs + inland freight \n\n \nThe simulated daily prices for gasoline A were transformed into monthly final consumer prices by adding \n\nfederal (CIDE, Pis/PASEP, Cofins) and state taxes (ICMS for S\u00e3o Paulo), costs for blending with anhydrous \n\nethanol, distribution and retailer transportation costs and margins. The price composition formula for gasoline C \n\npublished by NPA was used as a basis for the price calculation (see Appendix B). The quotas of the federal taxes \n\nwere provided by DATAGRO. For the calculation of the ICMS for S\u00e3o Paulo, the margin of aggregate value - MVA \n\n(for the period before March, 2014) and the weighted average final consumer price - PMFP (for the period \n\nafterwards) published by CONFAZ were used as a reference for the calculation of the tax burden. In addition, the \n\nanhydrous ethanol price provided by CEPEA/ESALQ was added to the gasoline A price, as well as a freight cost of \n\n0.05 BRL/liter. The reported by NPA retailer margin was included in the simulated consumer gasoline C price, in \n\naddition to the distribution margin and transportation costs, calculated by decomposing the observed final \n\nconsumer price of gasoline C for the period of interest.  \n\nThe evolution of the simulated free gasoline price in comparison to the observed price of this product for \n\nthe state of S\u00e3o Paul and the Europe Brent oil price is shown on figure 16. As it can be seen on the graph, the \n\nhypothetical free price accompanies the fluctuations in the international crude oil price and varies significantly during \n\nthe analyzed period. The actually observed domestic gasoline price, on the other hand, did not exhibit the same level \n\nof variation and did not move together with the price of oil. What draws attention, is the significant gap existing \n\nbetween the two gasoline price series through time. In most of the analyzed months, the simulated free gasoline price \n\nremained higher than the observed one, with the exception of the period between October, 2008 and June, 2009, and \n\nin the beginning of 2015. Both sub-periods are related to significant drops in the international crude oil price.  \n\nBefore 2010, the goal of the government with the intervention in the domestic fuel sector was primarily \n\nstimulating the production and use of biofuels (COSTA; BURNQUIST, 2016). Thus, the domestic gasoline price \n\nwas kept rather stable at a low level of round about 2.4 BRL/liter. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the goal of the \n\ngovernment changed and the domestic consumer price of gasoline went through several adjustments, following a \n\nsteady increasing trend, while the calculated hypothetical free price of this type of fuel is fluctuating significantly \n\nduring this period. The average difference between the two price series increased significantly after 2011, reaching \n\napproximately 17%. This is a rather high value, which suggests that the effects of the hypothetical free price on the \n\nfuel and biofuel markets in the country would have been significant during this period, as well.  \n\nIn 2015, the goal of the government with the intervention in the domestic fuel sector went back to the \n\npreviously established goal before 2010 of stimulating the domestic biofuel consumption, as well as helping the \n\nfinancial performance of the indebted Petrobras (COSTA; BURNQUIST, 2016). The government adjusted the \n\ndomestic gasoline price and set it at levels higher than the international equivalent that followed the drop in the \n\ninternational crude oil price. Thus, while some nations were benefiting from the low petroleum product prices in the \n\nbeginning of 2015, Brazil did not.  \n\n \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16.

A 1%-change in the consumer price of gasoline C causes approximately 1.027% \n\nincrease in the demanded quantity of hydrous ethanol, which is a result in line with the existing literature, where the \n\nshort-term cross-elasticity of ethanol demand lies between 0.75 and 2.56 (see table 10).  \n\n The consumption of hydrous ethanol responds significantly to changes in its own price, as well. A 1%-\n\nchange in the consumer ethanol price causes 1.386% decrease in the demand of this commodity. This estimated \n\nvalue is close to the short-term elasticities of ethanol demand in the existing literature, which remain in the range of \n\n0.55-1.96 in absolute terms when it comes to its own price (see table 10). Regarding the sensitivity of ethanol \n\nconsumption to income, a positive elasticity of 1.159 was estimated by the model.  \n\nIn the equation for the consumer price of hydrous ethanol, all coefficients are statistically significant. An \n\nincrease of 1% in the price of gasoline C is found to cause a contemporaneous response in the price of ethanol of \n\n0.893%. This elasticity is in line with the results of previously published studies, which estimate the effect of the price \n\nof gasoline on the price of ethanol between 0.79% (COSTA; BURNQUIST, 2016) and 1.12% (BACCHI, 2005). \n\nMoreover, a 1%-increase in the price of anhydrous ethanol, which was used as a proxy for the producer market \n\nsegment, was found to have a 0.276% impact on the price of its hydrous equivalent - a result very similar to the \n\nobtained by Diehl (2012). \n\nIn the gasoline demand equation, all estimated coefficients are statistically significant. A 1%-increase in \n\nthe price of ethanol generates a positive response of 1.080% in the consumption of gasoline C, while an increase in \n\nthe price of gasoline by 1% causes a drop in its sales of 1.828%. These results show that domestic demand for \n\ngasoline in Brazil was rather elastic during the observed period. The obtained values are in line with the results of \n\nSilva et al. (2009), who estimated short-term own price elasticity of gasoline demand equal to -1.505%.  \n\nThe estimated coefficients of contemporaneous effects between the variables of the SVEC model are \n\nused for the calculation of the hypothetical responses of the ethanol price and the demanded quantities for fuel and \n\nbiofuel to the simulated gasoline price that accompanies the fluctuations in the international crude oil price. Figures \n\n17, 18 and 19 plot the observed values of the three variables of interest in comparison to the calculated hypothetical \n\nvalues for a situation without government intervention in the domestic fuel sector.  \n\nIt is important to mention that the ceiling on the price of ethanol was accounted for when the \n\nhypothetical price of this product was calculated. For the periods when the calculated hypothetical price ratio of \n\nethanol and gasoline was above 0.7, the simulated hydrous ethanol price was set to be equal to 70% of the \n\nhypothetical price of gasoline.  \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nAs shown on figure 17, free domestic gasoline prices would have resulted in higher hydrous ethanol prices \n\nthan the observed ones during the analyzed period, with the only exceptions in the end of 2008 and during the first \n\nfew months of 2015 and of 2016. This result is rather different than the findings of Costa and Burnquist (2016), \n\naccording to which free gasoline prices has led to lower simulated ethanol prices than the observed ones between \n\n2006 and 2010, and in 2015, and higher simulated prices than the observed ones between 2011 and 2014.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 17. Observed versus hypothetical monthly average consumer price of hydrous ethanol for the state of S\u00e3o Paulo \nbetween January, 2007 and July, 2016 \n\nSource: Results of the research. \n\n \n\nThe beginning of the observed period corresponds to the burst of the global financial crisis, when the \n\ninternational price of crude oil registered a significant increase. The incorporation of the fluctuations in the oil price \n\nin the domestic fuel sector in Brazil, would have led to approximately 17% higher domestic gasoline prices than the \n\nobserved ones, which would have resulted in a difference of approximately 15% between the actual and the \n\nhypothetical consumer hydrous ethanol prices in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nIn the beginning of 2009, however, when the historically high international oil price registered a dramatic \n\ndrop, the simulated gasoline price remained approximately 5% below the observed one. This resulted in hypothetical \n\nprice of hydrous ethanol during the first months of 2009 approximately 1.9% lower than the observed price of this \n\ncommodity, indicating that the final consumer was paying for the government intervention in the fuel sector during \n\nthese months, while the ethanol producers were gaining from the practiced pricing policy. Hence, the controlling of \n\nthe gasoline price during this period can be interpreted as a subsidy for ethanol producers, as pointed out by Costa \n\nand Burnquist (2016). \n\nThe highest percentage difference between the observed and the hypothetical hydrous ethanol prices was \n\nobserved between October, 2010 and December, 2014, when the former was found to be approximately 17% lower \n\nthan the latter. Thus, during this period, the consumer stopped paying for the government intervention in the fuel \n\nsector. The lower observed ethanol price played the role of a discouragement factor for ethanol producers, for \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nwhom the price difference with the hypothetical values can be interpreted as a loss of revenue. This result can be \n\nattributed to a number of factors that played a role simultaneously between 2010 and 2014. \n\nFirst of all, the Brazilian ethanol sector suffered a severe crisis in the beginning of 2011 due to \n\nunfavorable climatic conditions, increased sugar production as a result of growing international prices, increased \n\nproduction costs for ethanol, lack of financing, and insufficient government stimuli towards the biofuel sector. \n\nDuring this period, the practiced fuel pricing policy was focused on keeping the price of gasoline at artificially lower \n\nlevels than the international equivalents. The government adjusted the domestic gasoline price 5 times between 2011 \n\nand 2014, and changed the flat-rate fuel tax CIDE four times, including making it 0 in June, 2012 (NPA, 2017). The \n\ngovernment control of the domestic fuel price is considered one of the main reasons for the underperformance of \n\nthe ethanol industry in Brazil between 2011 and 2014, making this fuel alternative more vulnerable and less \n\ncompetitive (SANTOS; GARCIA; SHIKIDA, 2015). In addition, according to Cesca, Ara\u00fajo and Bottrel (2016), the \n\nethanol crisis and the government intervention changed the demand elasticity of this biofuel towards a more elastic \n\nbehavior in the short-run.  \n\nMoreover, the BRL/USD exchange rate reached extremely high levels between 2011 and 2014 making \n\nimports rather expensive. This had significant negative impact for the domestic economy and especially for \n\nPetrobras, which had to cover the price gap between the expensive imported gasoline and the low domestic price of \n\nthis fuel during a period when gasoline imports reached significantly high levels. In addition, higher exchange rate \n\nmeans bigger gap between observed and hypothetical gasoline prices, since the latter is directly affected by the \n\ncambial variations, and in turn, bigger difference between the actual and simulated hydrous ethanol prices, as shown \n\non figure 17.  \n\nThe obtained results for the period between 2011 and 2014 show that the ethanol market could have been \n\nstimulated and most probably the crisis could have been avoided if the government was not intervening in the \n\ndomestic fuel sector. If the higher hypothetical hydrous ethanol prices were actually observed during this period, they \n\nwould have provided a stimulus for sugarcane producers to increase the supply of biofuel instead of sugar, which \n\ncould have mitigated at least some of the negative effects of the ethanol crisis. This result is particularly interesting \n\nfor everyone involved in the biofuel sector in Brazil, since it provides evidence for the advantages of a free fuel \n\npricing policy for the ethanol industry.  \n\nDuring the first months of 2015, however, the hypothetical hydrous ethanol price was found to be \n\napproximately 5% lower than the actual one. This period was characterized by a significant change in the \n\ninternational crude oil sector caused by the dramatic drop of the WTI and the Brent oil prices, which resulted in a \n\nsimulated free gasoline price lower than the observed one for the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Moreover, the focus of the \n\nBrazilian fuel pricing policy changed in the beginning of 2015. The domestic gasoline price was adjusted and set to a \n\nlevel higher than the international equivalent in an attempt to stimulate the use of biofuels and to improve the \n\nfinancial performance of Petrobras (COSTA; BURNQUIST, 2016). These trends led to higher observed hydrous \n\nethanol prices than the hypothetical ones without government intervention. This result shows how sensitive the price \n\nof ethanol would have been to changes in the international crude oil price if it was not indirectly controlled by the \n\ngovernment through the setting of the ex-refinery price of gasoline. \n\nAfter calculating the hypothetical price of hydrous ethanol for a situation in which the government set \n\nfree the price of gasoline in 2007, the analysis proceeds with the calculation of the hypothetical effects this fuel \n\npricing policy would have had on the demand for fuels. Since demanded quantities respond to changes in both their \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nown price and in the price of their main substitutes, the net effect of the hypothetical gasoline and ethanol prices was \n\naccounted for when the new fuel demand was calculated.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18. Observed versus hypothetical consumption of gasoline C in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo between January, 2007 and July, \n2016 \n\nSource: Results of the research. \n\n \nThe observed and the calculated hypothetical demanded quantities for gasoline C between 2007 and 2016 \n\nfor the state of S\u00e3o Paulo are shown on figure 18. As it can be seen on the graph, the hypothetical gasoline demand \n\nis lower than the observed with the only exception between October, 2008 and April, 2009 and in the beginning of \n\n2015, when it actually surpassed slightly the observed gasoline consumption.  \n\nIn the beginning of the period, the higher simulated gasoline prices without government intervention \n\nwould have caused approximately 14% lower gasoline demand than the artificially established by Petrobras fuel \n\nprices. The following significant drop of the international crude oil price in the beginning of 2009 as a result of the \n\nglobal financial crisis would have been incorporated in the domestic fuel market as well, resulting in lower simulated \n\nprices and higher gasoline demand by approximately 4% in comparison to the actually observed demand in the state \n\nof S\u00e3o Paulo during this period.  \n\nThe years of the ethanol crisis in Brazil, which correspond to a period of high international commodity \n\nprices, would have looked rather different if the domestic gasoline price was allowed to adjust to the fluctuation on \n\nthe international crude oil market. No government intervention between 2009 and 2014 would have resulted in \n\napproximately 17% lower gasoline demand. This trend would have been reversed in the beginning of 2015 due to the \n\nhistorically low international crude oil price from this period, which would have made domestic gasoline rather cheap \n\nand would have resulted in approximately 4% higher demanded quantities. \n\nThe obtained results show that the higher simulated gasoline price accompanying international crude oil \n\nprice fluctuations would have caused lower gasoline consumption \u2013 an effect that could not have been outweighed \n\nby the higher hypothetical hydrous ethanol price.  Thus, the artificially created demand for gasoline in Brazil, \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\nsupported by the government intervention in the fuel sector between 2011 and 2014, would have been broken if the \n\ndomestic gasoline price was allowed to fluctuate freely.   \n\nThe absence of government intervention in the domestic fuel sector would have had an impact on the \n\ndemand for hydrous ethanol in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, as well. The hypothetical consumption of hydrous ethanol if \n\nthe domestic gasoline price was freely fluctuating between 2007-2016 is calculated using the net effect of the \n\nsimulated gasoline and ethanol prices. The obtained results are shown on figure 19. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 19. Observed versus hypothetical consumption of hydrous ethanol in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo between January, 2007 and \nJuly, 2016 \n\nSource: Results of the research. \n\n \n\nAs it can be seen on the graph, free market gasoline prices would have resulted in slightly different \n\nethanol demand during the analyzed period in comparison to the actually observed demanded quantities. During \n\n2007 and 2008, the observed ethanol demand remained approximately 3.5% higher than the calculated hypothetical \n\ndemand for this commodity. This trend was reversed in the end of 2008, when the calculated biofuel consumption in \n\nthe absence of government intervention in the domestic fuel sector would have been approximately 1.2% higher \n\nthan the actual consumption in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. During the ethanol sector crisis between 2011 and 2014, \n\nhowever, the hypothetical demand for ethanol would have been lower than the observed one as a result of the higher \n\nsimulated ethanol prices \u2013 a trend reversed in 2015 when the price of ethanol in the absence of government \n\nintervention in the Brazilian fuel sector would have been lower than the observed one pushing domestic demand for \n\nthis commodity up.  \n\n \n\n4.6. Conclusions \n\nThe present work analyses the hypothetical effects of a gasoline price that accompanied the movements in \n\ninternational oil prices between 2007 and 2016 on the fuel and biofuel sectors in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nspecific characteristics of these sectors were taken into account when fitting an SVEC model with two cointegration \n\nrelationships, identified by the Johansen cointegration test, to the used data series. The results of the estimated \n\nmatrix of contemporaneous effects show that the consumer price of hydrous ethanol and the demanded quantities \n\nof ethanol and gasoline respond significantly to the contemporaneous variations in the consumer price of gasoline. \n\nThe obtained price elasticities were used for the calculation of the hypothetical effects of the absence of government \n\nintervention in the domestic fuel sector on the variables in the system. For the purposes of the analysis, a simulated \n\nfree consumer gasoline price was constructed, using the provided by DATAGRO series of \u201cinterned\u201d prices.  \n\nThe obtained results show that free gasoline prices that incorporate the fluctuations in the international \n\ncrude oil price would have led to higher hydrous ethanol price in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, making it more profitable \n\nfor sugarcane producers to engage in the production of ethanol instead of sugar. Moreover, the hypothetical gasoline \n\nprice without government intervention would have caused lower demand for gasoline, breaking the artificial demand \n\nfor this fuel created by the practiced fuel pricing policy of keeping the domestic fuel prices at lower levels than their \n\ninternational equivalents. These findings show that the ethanol sector could have benefitted from a freely fluctuating \n\ngasoline price between 2011 and 2014 and the negative effects of tin the industry during this period could have been \n\nmitigated at least to some extent.  \n\nThe performed analysis provides empirical evidence that the practiced fuel pricing policy in Brazil has had \n\nnegative impact on the ethanol sector in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo for the analyzed period. The artificially established by \n\nthe government domestic gasoline price has reduced the competitiveness of ethanol as a substitute for conventional \n\nfossil fuels and undermined the performance of this important sector, in which Brazil has been a worldwide leader \n\nboth in terms of production and exportation till the mid-2000s. There is a need for reformulating the fuel and \n\nbiofuel policy in the country, otherwise the ethanol sector will not be able to recover from the crisis. The Brazilian \n\nethanol sector has tremendous potential but it needs political incentives in order to regain its previous \n\ncompetitiveness as a substitute for conventional fuels and to reestablish itself in the country\u2019s energy matrix.  \n\nThe results of the present research are limited to the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Thus, estimating the hypothetical \n\neffects of free gasoline prices for other regions in Brazil, as well as for the country as a whole is considered to be an \n\nimportant step for further research. Moreover, the analysis of the effects of no government intervention in the fuel \n\nsector on the production of ethanol and sugar, as well as on the domestic economy as a whole constitute interesting \n\ntopics for continuation of the present research.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nALMEIDA, E.L.F.; OLIVEIRA, P.V.; LOSEKANN, L.

CONCLUSION \n\nThe recent trends in the international crude oil price have brought back the interest of researchers to the \n\nimportance of the practiced by the government fuel pricing policy for the domestic economy, especially in \n\ndeveloping countries. In addition, the existing food vs. fuel debate raised by the concerns about the increasing \n\nagricultural commodity and food prices as a result of the stimulating policies for the production of biofuels has \n\nreceived significant attention in the existing literature.  \n\nBrazil constitutes a particularly interesting case when it comes to the government participation in the \n\ndomestic fuel and biofuel sectors. The intervention in the fuel pricing mechanism in the country is indirect, with the \n\ngovernment influencing the formation of the domestic prices of petroleum derivatives through participation in the \n\norganization and decision making of the national oil company Petrobras and through irregular adjustments in the \n\nflat-fuel tax rate CIDE. The lack of consensus between the practiced fuel pricing mechanism in Brazil and the fiscal \n\npolicy on fuels has been the reason for the increasing concerns about the negative effects on the domestic fuel and \n\nbiofuel sectors. The severe crisis that the Brazilian ethanol industry experienced after 2011 was to some extent \n\ncaused by the practiced by the government fuel pricing and fiscal policies, which created artificial demand for \n\ngasoline by keeping the price of this commodity at lower levels than its international equivalents.  \n\nThe recent crisis of the biofuel industry in Brazil should serve as a lesson for the government. It reflects \n\nthe need for reformed fuel price adjustment mechanisms that are coherent and transparent and take into account the \n\nnegative consequences that administrating fuel prices has on the domestic economy. A free fuel pricing policy might \n\nnot be the best option for Brazil due to its history of high inflation. The example of Germany, however, shows that \n\nmarket fuel prices in combination with a flexible fiscal policy can lead to a competitive domestic fuel sector without \n\ninducing instability from the international crude oil market to the domestic economy. Thus, this combination of \n\npolicy alternatives should be considered carefully by the Brazilian government.  \n\nFurther research, however, is needed for the establishment of an accurate and better serving the needs of \n\nthe country fuel pricing policy, especially in combination with adequate fiscal measures. A comparison with other \n\ndeveloping economies and an analysis of the potential impacts of implementing their pricing regimes on the Brazilian \n\neconomy and on the use of biofuels is considered a relevant topic for future research. Knowledge about the \n\nexperience of other countries and the degree of success of their fuel pricing mechanisms is crucial for the \n\ndevelopment of a suitable policy for Brazil.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nAPPENDIX \n\nAPPENDIX A.  \n\nTable 1 - DF-GLS stationarity test: 07/2005-12/2008 \n\n Model 1 Model 2 \n\nVariable Lag DF-GLS Statistic Lag DF-GLS Statistic \n\nP?,?\n?  1 -2.144483 1 -2.931143 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -3.727151 0 -3.987809 \n\nP?,?\n?  1 -1.651107 1 -2.252536 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -3.280599 0 -3.791677 \n\nP?,?\n?  1 -1.932549 1 -2.358091 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -3.177952 0 -3.467894 \n\nP?,?\n?? 1 -2.416292 1 -3.025446 \n\n?P?,?\n?? 0 -3.824994 0 -4.460136 \n\nP?,?\n?? 1 -2.643150 1 -3.171712 \n\n?P?,?\n?? 0 -2.457798 0 -2.851770 \n\nP?,?\n?? 1 -0.713850 2 -2.786272 \n\n?P?,?\n?? 0 -3.219939 0 -3.962482 \n\nP?,?\n?  1 -1.361191 1 -2.135086 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -2.853735 0 -3.233722 \n\nP?,?\n?  2 -1.884583 2 -2.775757 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -3.744700 0 -4.160553 \n\nP?,?\n?  3 -2.130091 3 -2.693337 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -3.304237 0 -3.716984 \n\nNote: Model 1 \u2013 constant (critical values by MacKinnon (1996): 5% = -1.95; 1% = -2.58); Model 2 \u2013 constant and trend \n(critical values by Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1996): 5% = -3.2; 1% = -3.74).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nTable 2 - DF-GLS stationarity test: 01/2009-11/2016 \n\n Model 1 Model 2 \n\nVariable Lag DF-GLS Statistic Lag DF-GLS Statistic \n\nP?,?\n?  1 -1.394765 1 -1.756105 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -6.774759 0 -6.945305 \n\nP?,?\n?  1 -1.273844 1 -1.558762 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -6.651948 0 -6.754643 \n\nP?,?\n?  2 -1.171884 1 -1.940525 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -3.370146 0 -4.897849 \n\nP?,?\n?? 0 -1.625494 0 -1.779641 \n\n?P?,?\n?? 1 -8.944630 1 -9.033052 \n\nP?,?\n?? 1 -1.080393 1 -1.258001 \n\n?P?,?\n?? 0 -4.524208 0 -6.107679 \n\nP?,?\n?? 1 -1.151403 1 -1.339562 \n\n?P?,?\n?? 2 -2.233597 0 -5.676405 \n\nP?,?\n?  0 -1.005242 0 -1.404015 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -6.127505 0 -6.982590 \n\nP?,?\n?  0 -0.655711 0 -0.808698 \n\n?P?,?\n?  0 -4.999512 0 -6.674074 \n\nP?,?\n?  0 -0.986505 0 -1.192196 \n\n?P?,?\n?  1 -4.805122 0 -8.342202 \n\nNote: Model 1 \u2013 constant (critical values by MacKinnon (1996): 5% = -1.95; 1% = -2.58); Model 2 \u2013 constant and trend \n(critical values by Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1996): 5% = -3.2; 1% = -3.74).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\nAPPENDIX B.
