In situ tests and numerical \n\nmodelling  \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nA study on the behaviour of concrete dam foundations in normal operating conditions was \n\ncarried out with a view to validating and justifying the application of numerical models of \n\nhydromechanical analysis of rock masses, so that their use may become effective to make the \n\nanalysis of the monitoring data and safety control of these structures more efficient.  \n\nAppropriate ways to model both grout curtains and drainage systems were analysed, as well \n\nas ways to represent the geological and geotechnical conditions of the foundation areas \n\nstudied, namely taking into account the computational difficulties of three-dimensional \n\nmodels. In situ tests were carried out in two large Portuguese concrete dams, one gravity and \n\none arch, which proved to be essential to provide detailed information on the hydraulic \n\nactivity in the foundation, supplementing the available monitoring data. Hydraulic and \n\nhydromechanical models of both dams\u2019 foundation behaviour were developed, and used in the \n\nanalysis of failure scenarios in the case of the gravity dam. \n\nConclusions are drawn about the suitability and limitations of the numerical models \n\ndeveloped and the key parameters necessary to calibrate and use these models. Methods to \n\ndesign and use the foundation monitoring systems are proposed, for improvement of safety \n\nassessment. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: concrete dams; rock foundations; borehole water-inflow tests; numerical \n\nmodelling; hydromechanical behaviour; safety assessment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   iv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n v \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n \n\nI would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to the President of the National \n\nLaboratory for Civil Engineering, Researcher Carlos Matias Ramos, to the Director of the \n\nConcrete Dams Department, Researcher Carlos Alberto de Brito Pina, and to the Head of the \n\nMonitoring Division, Dr. Ant\u00f3nio Lopes Batista, for granting the time and team necessary to \n\ncarry out this study, and to the following people, without whose help and support it would not \n\nhave been possible: \n\nDr. Jos\u00e9 Vieira de Lemos, thesis supervisor, for his invaluable guidance and advice at all \n\ntimes, for always being available to discuss both the problems and the results, and for his \n\ncontinued encouragement and constructive criticism.

Moreover, \n\nreservoirs are nowadays increasingly used for recreation, which can attract tourists and thus \n\nbenefit the local economy. In spite of this, however, the future of dams is currently the subject \n\nof much debate, as a large number of people claim that dams are damaging the environment \n\nand that their construction has undesirable social effects.  \n\nThe fact that a large number of dams are a source of renewable energy, which is generated \n\nwithout polluting the atmosphere, is a major advantage in meeting increasing electricity \n\nneeds. Hydroelectricity today provides almost 20 % of the world\u2019s power, and although other \n\nrenewable energy sources, such as solar and eolic energy, have potential for increased use, \n\nthey also have limiting characteristics as they can not provide the continuous, reliable supply \n\nwhich is needed. Therefore, multipurpose developments, which include more than one dam \n\nand in which the water may be pumped from a downstream to an upstream reservoir in the \n\nhours of lower power consumption are increasingly being built to fulfil this necessity. \n\nIn European countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal, a significant period of construction of \n\nconcrete dams took place in the 1950s along with the economic recovery that followed the \n\nend of the 2nd World War, and the main emphasis was on the exploitation of hydroelectric \n\nresources for local economic development. Several concrete dams were also built during the \n\n1980s in Portugal, and indeed at present the trend is for increasing construction. Four 20-35 m \n\nhigh concrete dams were built in Portugal in the last three years (Fumadinha, Ferradosa, \n\nOlgas and Pretarouca dams), there are currently two large dams under construction (Baixo \n\nSabor dams), and the tender for the construction of three more dams has recently been opened \n\n(new Alto Ceira dam, Ribeiradio and Ermida dams). The first four were constructed for water \n\nsupply, while the others are mainly for energy production. In addition, in 2007, the \n\nPortuguese Water Institute (INAG \u2013 Instituto da \u00c1gua) launched the \u201cNational Programme \n\nfor Dams with High Hydroelectric Potential\u201d with the aim of identifying and defining \n\npriorities for investments in hydroelectric developments until 2020, to increase the national \n\nhydroelectric capacity from the current 5000 MW up to 7000 MW, in order to decrease \n\nenergy dependency and reduce the carbon dioxide emissions. Thanks to this programme, eight \n\nlarge dams will be built, mainly for energy production (Foz Tua, Padroselos, Alto T\u00e2mega, \n\nDaiv\u00f5es, Gouv\u00e3es, Frid\u00e3o, Alvito and Girabolhos dams), only one of which is less than 70 m \n\nhigh. \n\n\n\n   2 \n\n1.1 The role of the foundation in the safety of concrete dams \n\nConcrete dams are built with their foundations in rock masses, which are discontinuous and, \n\nin most cases, heterogeneous and anisotropic. Accidents at Malpasset dam, in France in 1959, \n\nand Vajont, in Italy in 1963, among others, highlighted the significance of the characteristics \n\nof these rock masses. In fact, the foundation rock mass is part of a structural system which \n\nincludes the dam, the foundation and the reservoir, and is a crucial element when considering \n\nsafety, as can be concluded from the results of various statistical studies of dam deterioration \n\ncarried out by the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD). \n\nThe identification and analysis, on a worldwide scale, of the main accident and incident \n\nscenarios that have taken place in concrete, masonry and embankment dams, has been the \n\nsubject of study of numerous working groups, among which the studies carried out by several \n\nICOLD committees are highlighted. In order to get the largest amount of information possible \n\nabout accidents and/or incidents in dams ICOLD has already sent out three questionnaires to \n\nwhich a large number of countries responded. Among the studies presented by ICOLD \n\ncommittees it is worth mentioning the following bulletins: \n\n? Lessons from dam incidents (ICOLD 1974); \n\n? Deterioration of dams and reservoirs. Examples and their analysis (ICOLD 1983); \n\n? Ageing of dams and appurtenant works. Review and recommendations (ICOLD \n\n1994); \n\n? Dam failures. Statistical analysis (ICOLD 1995).  \n\nThe conclusion was drawn that the main cause of accidents in concrete and embankment \n\ndams was overtopping due to floods greater than predicted in the design stage or due to \n\noperating faults of appurtenant works, followed by faulty behaviour of dam body and \n\nfoundation. \n\nIn concrete dams, not including issues related with the appurtenant works, the majority of \n\nrecorded failures were due to problems in the foundation rock mass such as erosion and \n\ninternal dissolving of rock masses, which often lead to a loss of strength, and lack of shear \n\nresistance in weak planes of unfavourable direction. \n\nThe safety control of dams throughout their lifetime, which includes the phases of design, \n\nconstruction, first filling of the reservoir, operation, and decommissioning, has always been a \n\nmajor concern, especially for those structures of which the failure has the potential for loss of \n\nhuman life and economic consequences. Dams are therefore systematically equipped with a \n\nlarge number of monitoring instruments, of which the results enable the continuing evaluation \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nof dam behaviour. In addition, there are nowadays, in a great number of countries, \n\nregulations, guidelines and codes of practice, which have been continuously updated in order \n\nto reduce the risk of accidents. This is the case in Portugal, where the first Regulation for the \n\nSafety of Dams, published in 1990, was recently revised (RSB 2007). \n\nThe safety control of concrete dams has improved significantly in recent years, with the \n\nincreasing use of numerical models not only in the analysis of the dam\u2019s actual performance \n\nbut also in the prediction of its behaviour. However, these developments have been mainly \n\nrestricted to the study of the concrete super-structure. The great complexity of concrete dam \n\nfoundations, not only due to the existence of discontinuities and heterogeneities but also to the \n\nfoundation treatment necessary to improve mechanical and hydraulic properties, has always \n\nmade both the mechanical and hydraulic characterization and the analysis of its behaviour \n\ndifficult.  \n\nSeepage through the rock mass in a concrete dam foundation is a crucial factor and it is well \n\nknown that there is a significant interdependence between the mechanical and hydraulic \n\nbehaviour. In fact, in a rock mass the majority of the flow takes place through a complex \n\ninterconnecting system of discontinuities, whose aperture may vary with variations in stresses \n\nand/or strains within the foundation, due, for instance, to changes in the reservoir level. Even \n\nslight changes in apertures can lead to significant changes in the quantity of water flowing \n\nthrough the discontinuities. Changes in flow patterns cause changes in mechanical loads, \n\nwhich, in turn, are responsible for changes in the state of stress. A comprehensive review of \n\nhydromechanical couplings in fractured rock masses as a result of or directly connected with \n\nhuman activities, can be found in Rutqvist and Stephansson (2003).  \n\nThe effects of water pressures in both the dam body and its foundation were recognized in the \n\nlate 1800s, and started to be studied in a scientific way after the concept of effective pressure \n\nwas introduced by Terzaghi, in 1923. In dam foundations, hydromechanical behaviour began \n\nto receive wide attention in the early 1960s, during the investigation of the Malpasset dam \n\nfailure. Some of the first studies on coupled hydromechanical behaviour in fractured rocks \n\nwere related to dam foundations (Londe and Sabarly 1966; Louis 1969; Louis and Maini \n\n1970), and since then it has been the subject of extensive laboratory and in situ research (e.g. \n\nCappa et al. 2005; 2006; Cornet et al. 2003; Giacomini et al. 2008; Kovari and Koppel 1987; \n\nNoorishad et al. 1992; Olsson and Barton 2001; Rutqvist et al. 1992). However, as mentioned \n\nin Rutqvist and Stephansson (2003), during the past two decades most of the research and \n\ndevelopment on hydromechanical coupling in fractured rocks and most applications of \n\nhydromechanical coupled analysis have been conducted as part of oil and gas exploration, \n\nhot-dry rock geothermal energy investigations, and studies for nuclear waste disposal. Thus, \n\nthe application of research results to the field conditions of dam foundations is still difficult.  \n\n\n\n   4 \n\nRegarding the dam foundation rock mass, in particular the hydromechanical behaviour, the \n\navailable numerical techniques are not commonly used to support the analysis of the \n\nmonitoring data or the safety control, even though there are currently various numerical \n\nmethods of mechanical and hydromechanical analysis of rock masses which can be \n\neffectively used for this purpose, which are systematically presented in Jing and Hudson \n\n(2002) and in Jing (2003). These may be divided into two different approaches: continuum \n\nand discontinuum modelling, and include different numerical techniques such as the finite \n\nelement, finite difference and boundary element methods (FEM, FDM and BEM), in \n\ncontinuum analysis, or the discrete element method (DEM), the discontinuous deformation \n\nanalysis (DDA) and the bonded particle method (BPM), in discontinuum analysis.  \n\n1.2 Objectives \n\nThe main aim of this research is to validate and justify the application of numerical models \n\nfor the analysis of hydromechanical behaviour so that their use may become effective, in \n\norder to improve our ability to analyse the monitoring data of concrete dam foundations, to \n\nmake the safety assessment of these structures more efficient. For this, it is essential to carry \n\nout systematic and comprehensive work to verify the computational codes, to validate the \n\nhypotheses assumed in the numerical codes by comparison of numerical results with both \n\nexperimental and field data, and to develop methodologies to calibrate the model for the \n\nspecific geological and geotechnical conditions of a given dam foundation. \n\nThe information which is commonly available regarding the hydraulic activity in concrete \n\ndam foundations is the quantity of water collected in drainage systems, and water pressures \n\nrecorded in piezometers located in the various dam blocks. Although essential for the \n\nassessment of both dam behaviour and safety, this information is not sufficient to develop \n\naccurate hydraulic models, which require the location of seepage paths to be known. In situ \n\nwater-inflow tests are proposed, which are capable of providing more complete information \n\non the foundation\u2019s hydraulic behaviour. \n\nDam performance is often assessed using statistical methods, based on previously collected \n\nmonitoring results. These simplified methods have been regularly employed in the analysis of \n\ndam displacements but are seldom used in the analysis of hydraulic behaviour. An attempt is \n\nmade to apply these methods in the analysis of drainage data. \n\nConcerning numerical modelling, the first studies of the hydraulic behaviour of rock masses \n\nused equivalent continuum models. There are more advanced discontinuum models (fracture \n\nflow models), which accurately simulate rock masses\u2019 hydromechanical behaviour, however, \n\nthese models require data which is not usually available, such as that regarding the complex \n\njointing pattern or the joint hydraulic properties. One of the purposes of this study is to \n\n\n\n 5 \n\ndevelop a methodology for the application of equivalent continuum models, which can be \n\neffectively used in practice, based on data that can be easily obtained from both monitoring \n\nand in situ tests. Although not practical to study dam\u2019s hydraulic behaviour, discontinuum \n\nmodels are commonly used for safety evaluation, and the simpler equivalent continuum \n\nmodels can also provide relevant information to be used in these more complex models. \n\nSome practical issues merit further attention, mainly regarding the use of three-dimensional \n\n(3D) numerical models, required to accurately simulate the behaviour of dam foundations, \n\nespecially arch dams. Large 3D global models of dam foundations are not feasible without \n\nsimplified representations of both the grout and drainage systems, which have to be properly \n\naddressed and justified. It is necessary to develop, test and validate this type of model, which \n\nmust not only simulate flow correctly, but also be computationally efficient.  \n\n1.3 Thesis outline \n\nThe thesis is composed of eight chapters. In this chapter 1 the role of the foundation in the \n\nsafety of concrete dams is highlighted, the subject\u2019s relevance is justified and the main aims \n\nof the thesis are presented. \n\nChapter 2 focuses on the behaviour and analysis of concrete dam foundations. It starts by \n\ndescribing main aspects related to rock mass characterization, fluid flow through rock mass \n\ndiscontinuities, and hydromechanical behaviour of rock joints. The specific features of \n\nconcrete dam foundations are presented, namely the sealing and drainage treatment measures, \n\nand the influence that both grout and drainage systems have on the foundation\u2019s hydraulic \n\nactivity is highlighted. The main cases of foundation deterioration observed in Portugal are \n\nbriefly referred to. A review of previous studies is presented along with a reference to the \n\nmain numerical methods available to simulate or interpret the hydromechanical behaviour of \n\ndam foundations. The factors that influence the choice between equivalent continuum and \n\ndiscontinuous models are outlined and the fundamentals of fluid flow in either continuum or \n\ndiscontinuum media are presented. Finally, a reference is made to the numerical codes used in \n\nthis study. \n\nChapter 3 addresses the observation and analysis of concrete dam foundation behaviour. A \n\nreference is made to: i) the measures usually taken to fulfil both safety and serviceability \n\nrequirements; ii) the monitoring equipment to measure the main loads, the factors which \n\ndefine seepage in the foundation (uplift and discharges) and those which must be known to \n\ndefine the states of stress and strain of the foundation rock mass (displacements, strains and \n\nstresses); and iii) the methodologies currently used in the collecting and collating of the \n\nmonitoring data. Simplified methods, such as quantitative interpretation, are traditionally used \n\nto interpret recorded data and thus a brief review of these methods is presented. However, due \n\n\n\n   6 \n\nto the non-linear behaviour of the foundation rock mass the principle of superposition of \n\neffects is not valid, making the application of these methods in the analysis of recorded \n\ndischarges and water pressures difficult. A method is proposed for the analysis of the recorded \n\ndischarges which takes into account the non-linear hydromechanical behaviour, due to the \n\ninfluence of stress and strain on the permeability. \n\nThe study carried out included a series of field tests, which proved to be essential to provide \n\ndetailed information on the hydraulic activity in the foundation rock mass, supplementing the \n\navailable monitoring data. Tests were carried out with a view to understanding the way in \n\nwhich flow occurs in specific areas of the foundation and validating numerical models so that \n\ntheir use may become effective. Borehole water-inflow tests, which allow measurement of \n\ndischarges and water pressures in isolated sections of boreholes, were conducted in the \n\nfoundation of two large Portuguese concrete dams, one gravity and one arch. As there are no \n\npre-established testing methods, these were developed within this study to provide \n\ninformation which can be useful in the analysis and safety assessment of any dam foundation. \n\nChapter 4 presents a thorough description of these tests, the main characteristics of the dams \n\nwhere tests were carried out, with emphasis on those related with the foundation, and analysis \n\nof tests results. Additional tests were carried out and despite some difficulties found whilst \n\ntesting in situ, which are pointed out in order to be avoided in future studies, the tests \n\nprovided valuable information without which the hydraulic and hydromechanical models \n\npresented in the subsequent chapters could not have been developed.  \n\nAlthough rock masses are discontinuous structures, the most widely used tool to study the \n\nhydraulic behaviour of concrete dam foundations are models based on the assumption of an \n\nequivalent continuum medium. Chapter 5 starts by presenting validation tests of two of the \n\nnumerical codes used in this study in hydraulic analysis against analytical solutions. \n\nConclusions drawn from these tests regarding the representation of the drain and suitable \n\nmesh sizes in the study of seepage flow provided the basis to develop a three dimensional \n\nmodel of a restricted area of the foundation of one of the dams where borehole water-inflow \n\ntests were carried out, and this 3D model was used to study the influence of different factors, \n\nsuch as the influence of drainage, boundary conditions, grout curtain permeability, model size \n\nand mesh size. The flow in fractured rock masses is mainly three-dimensional but 2D models \n\ncan sometimes be used, with the advantage of being much simpler, and therefore results of 2D \n\nand 3D models were compared. \n\nConclusions drawn in chapter 5 were essential to develop and justify the application of both \n\n2D and 3D models presented in chapters 6 and 7, in which two case studies of Portuguese \n\ndams are examined. In both chapters, the validity of the used numerical models of the dam-\n\nfoundation structural system is assessed by comparing the numerical results to the monitoring \n\n\n\n 7 \n\ndata and special attention is given to the foundation\u2019s hydraulic and hydromechanical \n\nbehaviour.  \n\nThe study presented in chapter 6 included the development of a series of numerical models to \n\nsimulate the hydraulic and hydromechanical behaviour of the studied arch dam foundation, \n\nwhich were progressively validated and calibrated against field data. Borehole water-inflow \n\ntests were simulated, and the knowledge of both seepage patterns around particular boreholes \n\nand of the key parameters was essential to develop an effective application of a simplified \n\nglobal model of the dam foundation, which provided a good match of both average recorded \n\ndischarges and water pressures. Global hydraulic models of dam foundations are useful not \n\nonly for the assessment of the behaviour of operating dams but also to determine water \n\npressure distributions for safety analysis. A simple methodology was developed, which, with \n\nan uncoupled mechanical-hydraulic analysis, can be used to establish rules that allow the \n\ncalculation of discharges for different reservoir levels.  \n\nChapter 7 links analysis of seepage and hydromechanical behaviour of the studied gravity \n\ndam foundation with stability assessment. Borehole water-inflow test results were again of \n\nmajor importance in the development of numerical models which properly simulate dam \n\nbehaviour. Both two-dimensional equivalent continuum and discontinuum models were \n\ndeveloped, and the latter was used to assess water pressures within the foundation and to \n\nevaluate the safety for different possible failure scenarios involving either the foundation or \n\nthe dam body.  \n\nIn the last chapter, a critical discussion of the results obtained and a summary of the main \n\nconclusions are presented. Conclusions are drawn about the suitability and limitations of the \n\nnumerical models developed to interpret and forecast the behaviour of the foundation rock \n\nmasses and the key parameters necessary to calibrate and use these models. Methods to design \n\nand use the foundation monitoring systems are proposed, for improvement of safety \n\nassessment. Finally, suggestions for further research are proposed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n2 Concrete dam foundations. Hydromechanical behaviour and \nanalysis \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nThe mechanical and hydraulic processes in rock masses are not independent. Fluid flow \n\ninfluences the mechanical behaviour since changes in water flow cause variations in seepage \n\nforces and in hydraulic uplift. These mechanical loads change the stress field, thus inducing \n\ndeformations in the fractured rock mass. These deformations, in turn, cause changes in \n\npermeability and consequently changes in water flow. This is called a coupled \n\nhydromechanical process and the coupling mechanisms are between the fracture aperture, \n\nrock porosity/permeability, fluid pressure and rock stress (Jing and Stephansson 2007). \n\nThis chapter focuses on the behaviour and analysis of concrete dam foundations. It starts by \n\ndescribing main aspects related to rock mass characterization, followed by a summary of the \n\ngoverning equations both in continuum media and through rock mass discontinuities. The \n\nmain aspects related to hydromechanical behaviour of rock joints are referred to. The specific \n\nfeatures of concrete dam foundations are presented, namely the sealing and drainage treatment \n\nmeasures, and the influence that both grout and drainage systems have on the foundation\u2019s \n\nhydraulic activity is highlighted. The main cases of foundation deterioration observed in \n\nPortugal are briefly referred to. A review of previous studies is presented along with a \n\nreference to the main numerical methods available to simulate or interpret the \n\nhydromechanical behaviour of dam foundations. Finally, a reference is made to the numerical \n\ncodes used in this study. \n\n2.2 Characterization of rock masses \n\nThe foundation of any dam is always a complex structure that requires a well designed and \n\ncomprehensive site and laboratory investigation programme. The results of this investigation \n\nshould provide sufficient knowledge of the foundation to help and justify the design of both \n\nthe super-structure and the foundation treatment, and to predict the response of the foundation \n\nto the physical conditions that are going to be imposed by dam construction and subsequent \n\nloading. There is extensive literature on characterization of rock masses, which includes \n\ngeological, geotechnical and foundation materials investigations (e.g. Hudson and Cosgrove \n\n1997; ICOLD 2005; ISRM 2007; USACE 1984) so only the most relevant matters for the \n\nstudy presented here are addressed below. \n\nLaboratory and in situ tests are carried out in order to characterize strength, deformability, \n\nstate of stress and hydraulic properties. The size of the samples tested in the laboratory is not \n\nusually large enough to be representative of the rock mass with regard to heterogeneity and \n\n\n\n   10 \n\njointing. In most cases, there is also a scale effect, which makes it difficult to use laboratory \n\ndata to estimate the properties of fractured rock masses. In situ tests are often required but \n\nthey typically involve a small area of the foundation and thus the results may not be \n\nrepresentative. Therefore, despite all the investigation carried out prior to and during dam \n\nconstruction, it is well acknowledged and should always be kept in mind that the foundation \n\ngeology, geomechanics and hydromechanical behaviour can never be fully known.   \n\n2.2.1 Geological and hydrogeological investigations \n\nMapping of the foundation surface geology is the first activity undertaken to acquire a basic \n\nknowledge of the geology. Different types of surface geological maps may be drawn, \n\ndepending on the information required, but they should employ engineering rock description \n\nterms in order to be useful for engineering practice. ICOLD (2005) highlights that the map \n\nmust emphasize features that are relevant to the identification of geological concerns affecting \n\ndesign, project safety and performance. In this regard, the identification of discontinuities \n\n(including measurement and orientation), such as faults, joints and bedding planes, is essential \n\nfor geological mapping, because discontinuities usually govern the performance of the rock \n\nmass. Geological cross-sections along and perpendicular to the dam axis are also of major \n\nimportance. \n\nAmong the various guides that have been suggested to prepare geological maps, which give \n\nthe terminology and symbols to be used, are those presented by the International Society for \n\nRock Mechanics (ISRM 1978, 1981). The first document suggests methods for the \n\nquantitative description of rock masses and discontinuities, and the second provides \n\nqualitative and quantitative descriptive elements for characterizing the mechanical behaviour \n\nof rock masses. In the latter, five characteristics are taken into account: the rock name, with a \n\nsimplified geological description; two structural characteristics of the rock mass: layer \n\nthickness and fracture intercept; and two mechanical characteristics: the uniaxial compressive \n\nstrength (UCS) of the rock material and the angle of friction of the fractures. The simplified \n\ngeological description should include a reference to: i) the geological structure of the rock \n\nmass; ii) the fracturing of the rock mass; iii) colour, texture and mineral composition of the \n\nrock material; and iv) the degree of weathering. Figure 2.1 shows the five different intervals \n\nwithin which each one of the characteristics is described. The terms and symbols used to \n\nclassify the degree of weathering are shown in Figure 2.2. \n\nRegarding hydrogeological investigations it is not only important to understand the \n\ngroundwater conditions prior to dam construction, but also to identify springs and seepages \n\nthat occur in the dam area. Springs that appear during excavation should be treated and the \n\nwater properly diverted to the downstream area. One of the most important hydrogeological \n\nparameters is the permeability of the rock mass, which is controlled by the characteristics of \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nthe discontinuities, because their permeability is usually several orders higher than that of the \n\nunweathered rock. \n\n \n\nIntervals \n\n(cm) \n\nSymbols  Descriptive terms  Intervals \n\n(cm) \n\nSymbols  Descriptive terms \n\n> 200 L 1  Very \n\nlarge \n\n  > 200 F 1  Very \n\nwide \n\n \n\n  L 1,2  Large    F 1,2  Wide \n\n60 \u2013 200 L 2  Large   60 \u2013 200 F 2  Wide  \n\n20 \u2013 60 L 3 L 3 Moderate Moderate  20 \u2013 60 F 3 F 3 Moderate Moderate \n\n6 \u2013 20 L 4  Small   6 \u2013 20 F 4  Close  \n\n  L 4,5  Small    F 4,5  Close \n\n&lt;6 L 5  Very \n\nsmall \n\n  &lt;6 F 5  Very \n\nclose \n\n \n\nLayer thickness     Fracturing intercept \n\nIntervals \n\n(MPa) \n\nSymbols  Descriptive terms  Intervals \n\n(\u00b0) \n\nSymbols  Descriptive terms \n\n> 200 S 1  Very high   > 45 A 1  Very \n\nhigh \n\n \n\n  S 1,2  High    A 1,2  High \n\n60 \u2013 200 S 2  High   35 \u2013 45 A 2  High  \n\n20 \u2013 60 S 3 S 3 Moderate Moderate  25 \u2013 45 A 3 A 3 Moderate Moderate \n\n6 \u2013 20 S 4  Low   15 \u2013 25 A 4  Low  \n\n  S 4,5  Low    A 4,5  Low \n\n&lt;6 S 5  Very low   &lt;15 A 5  Very low  \n\n   Uniaxial compressive strength of the rock   Angle of friction of the fractures  \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Intervals, symbols and descriptive terms used in the Basic Geotechnical \n\nDescription of Rock Masses (BGD) (ISRM 1981). \n\n \n\nTerm Description Symbols \n\nFresh No visible sign of rock material weathering; perhaps slight discolouration \n\non major discontinuity surfaces. \n\nW1 \n\nSlightly weathered Discolouration indicates weathering of rock material and discontinuity \n\nsurfaces.

The results of a \n\nseries of laboratory experiments conducted by Henry Darcy to study flows of water in vertical \n\nhomogeneous sand filters, the results of which he published in 1856, indicated that, \n\nmacroscopically, the velocity of a fluid through porous media is directly proportional to the \n\npressure gradient acting on the fluid:  \n\nik\nH\n\n?v  (2.1) \n\nor, since  the discharge per unit time (rate of discharge or flow rate) is given by q = v A \n\nAikq\nH\n\n?  (2.2) \n\nThe quantity of discharge in a period of time equal to t is given by:  \n\ntAikQ\nH\n\n?  (2.3) \n\nIn the previous equations: v = discharge velocity (m/s); kH = Darcy\u2019s coefficient of \n\npermeability or hydraulic conductivity (m/s); i = hydraulic gradient (head loss / length over \n\nwhich head loss occurs (m/m)); q = rate of discharge (discharge on a unit time (m\n3\n/s)); \n\nA = cross-sectional area of flow (m\n2\n); Q = quantity of discharge (m\n\n3\n); t = time of flow (s). \n\nDarcy\u2019s law only applies to linear flow (adjacent flow lines are locally straight and parallel), \n\nthus for high seepage velocities, Darcy\u2019s law does not hold. The upper limit on the range of \n\nvalidity of Darcy\u2019s law is given by the Reynolds number (Re), a dimensionless number which, \n\nin steady-state conditions, expresses the ratio of inertial to viscous (frictional) forces during \n\nflow. \n\nDarcy\u2019s coefficient of permeability, also known as hydraulic conductivity or simply \n\npermeability is expressed as a velocity and is usually given in m/s. In fact, the \u201chydraulic \n\nconductivity\u201d is a measure of permeability that includes both the properties of the medium \n\nand of the fluid (i.e. density (?) and viscosity (?), or, in the combined form of kinematic \n\nviscosity (? = ?/?)), while \u201cpermeability\u201d is an intrinsic property of the medium that is \n\nindependent of the properties of any fluid (usually expressed in cm\n2\n or Darcys). Permeability \n\n(k) can be converted to hydraulic conductivity (kH) with knowledge of the fluid properties: \n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n\n? gk\nk\n\ng\nkk\n\nH\n???  \n\n(2.4) \n\nwhere ? = unit weight of the fluid; ? = dynamic viscosity of the fluid; ? = fluid density; \n\ng = gravity acceleration; and ? = kinematic viscosity of the fluid. In practice, however, the \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nterm permeability is often used instead of hydraulic conductivity. Permeability calculated on \n\nthe basis of Darcy\u2019s law is limited to the conditions of laminar flow and complete saturation \n\nof the media. When equivalent continuum models are used to study flow in dam foundation \n\nrock masses, permeability should be referred to as equivalent permeability. \n\nThe hydraulic conductivity of concrete dam foundation rock masses is commonly evaluated \n\nwith constant-head tests, known as \u201cLugeon type tests\u201d (Houlsby 1976). These tests are \n\nsystematically carried out i) during geological investigations, ii) when drilling grout and \n\ndrainage boreholes, and, iii) with the dam already built, when opening piezometric holes. \n\nDuring geological investigations the results of these tests give important data which is used in \n\nthe design of seepage control measures. During the initial phase of dam use, structural weight \n\nand hydrostatic loads acting simultaneously lead to great stress changes in the rock mass, with \n\na consequent change in joint apertures and fluid flow. The repetition of these tests in drains \n\nand piezometric holes during the structure\u2019s lifetime can allow the detection of seepage \n\nchanges. \n\nThe well known Lugeon test was originally proposed by Maurice Lugeon, in order to \n\nestablish a simple empirical criterion to design grouting in dam foundations (Lugeon 1932), \n\nand since then it has been widely used to estimate the permeability of rock masses. The test \n\ninvolves isolating a section of a borehole with the aid of packers and injecting water under \n\npressure into that section until the flow rate for any given pressure is constant. The original \n\ntest was conducted at a pressure of 1 MPa (10 bar), and the results were expressed in Lugeon \n\nunits (LU), 1 LU being defined as the water take of 1 litre / minute per metre length of test \n\nsection, at an effective pressure of 1 MPa (Houlsby 1976). Over the years several changes \n\nhave been suggested to improve the tests, such as adapting the test interval length to the joint \n\npattern of the rock mass, considering various pressure stages; and adapting pressure values to \n\nthe rock mass characteristics, the test depth, and the maximum water pressures expected \n\nduring the dam\u2019s lifetime. \n\nInjection tests in boreholes lead to scalar values of hydraulic conductivity. However, the rock \n\nmass permeability can be highly anisotropic and the differences in the permeability in \n\ndifferent directions can be of various orders (Rocha and Franciss 1977). To take into account \n\nthe anisotropy in the rock mass permeability, i.e. to determine its hydraulic conductivity \n\ntensor (or permeability tensor), various methods have been proposed by different authors (e.g. \n\nLouis 1969; Serafim and Del Campo 1965; Snow 1965). Rocha and Franciss (1977) \n\nsuggested a method that had the great advantage, compared to the previously devised \n\nmethods, of allowing the determination of the permeability tensor at a point from a single \n\nintegral sample, provided it was representative of the fracturing. However, Wittke (1990) is of \n\nthe opinion that this method is only a supplementary method to determine permeability, as \n\nintegral samples have small dimensions and are rarely representative of permeability. Wang et \n\n\n\n   14 \n\nal. (2002) presented a new methodology based on the numerical simulation of a few hydraulic \n\ntests carried out in situ, using a discrete fracture flow model. Despite these attempts, Lugeon \n\ntype tests remain the most widely used tool to evaluate the equivalent permeability of \n\nconcrete dam foundations. \n\nPermeability values can be expressed either in Lugeon units or in m/s. This allows the \n\ncomparison of the permeability of a heterogeneous and fractured rock mass with that of a \n\nhomogeneous medium which has the same water take at a pressure of 10 bar. It is usually \n\nassumed that 1 LU is equivalent to 1.3 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, or more frequently simply to 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s \n\n(Fell et al. 2005; Houlsby 1976; Lancaster-Jones 1975; Wyllie 1999). This value may be \n\nobtained using the solution for steady-state laminar flow in homogeneous and isotropic media \n\naround a test well. Hvorslev and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, in 1951, Moye, in 1967, \n\nand Hoek and Bray, in 1981, suggested the use of different formulas for analysis of water \n\npressure tests (Bulut et al. 1996; Hoek and Bray 1981; Hvorslev 1951; Moye 1967). Hamm et \n\nal. (2007) show that the equations suggested by the first two above-mentioned authors are \n\nmathematically the same, and that those suggested by the last two (Table 2.1) are simplified \n\ncases of the Hvorslev formula.  \n\nLugeon type tests are usually carried out in 5.0 m long test sections in boreholes with a \n\ndiameter of 76 mm. In this case, according to Moye\u2019s formula 1 LU is equivalent to \n\n1.4 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. Hoek and Bray (1981) suggest that for most applications the ratio between the \n\nequivalent permeability perpendicular to the borehole and that in the parallel direction (kr/kz) \n\nis about 10\n6\n. This implies that there are no fractures parallel to the hole, and in most rock \n\nmasses this would not be a reasonable approximation (Fell et al. 2005). If it is assumed that \n\nkr/kz = 10 then 1 LU is equivalent to 1.6 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. In homogeneous isotropic conditions \n\nkr = kz and thus m = (kr/kz)\n1/2\n\n = 1, and 1 LU is equivalent to 1.3 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. \n \n\nMoye (1967) \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\nw\ne\n\nr\n\nL\n\nHL\n\nQ\nk\n\n2\nln1\n\n12 0?\n \n\n Remark : based on the assumption of radial laminar \n\nflow in a homogeneous isotropic rock mass \n\n \n\nHoek and Bray \n\n(1981) \n012\n\nln\n\nHL\n\nr\n\nLm\nQ\n\nk\nw\n\ne\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?       where \n21\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nz\n\nr\n\nk\n\nk\nm  \n\n Remark : based on the assumption of ellipsoidal \n\nsymmetrical flow about the axis of the borehole        \n\ntest section (simplified case of the Hvorslev      \n\nequation when m L > 10 \u00d7 2 rw). \n\n \n\nke = equivalent hydraulic \n\nconductivity (m/s) \n\nQ = flow rate (m\n3\n/s) \n\nrw = radius of the borehole (m) \n\nL = length of the test section (m) \n\nH0 = increase in head compared \n\nwith that at rest (m) \n\nkr = equivalent permeability \n\nperpendicular to the borehole \n\nkz = equivalent permeability \n\nparallel to the borehole \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTable 2.1 - Formulas suggested by Moye (1967) and Hoek and Bray (1981) for analysis of \n\nwater pressure tests. \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n2.2.2 Geotechnical investigations \n\nField investigations include the collecting of information from test pits and trenches (and if \n\nnecessary from adits and shafts), examination of cored boreholes, and various tests carried out \n\nin order to evaluate: i) the permeability and the deformability of the different areas of the dam \n\nfoundation, ii) the shear strength parameters of intact rock and discontinuities, and iii) the in \n\nsitu state of stress. The different methods for investigating dam foundation rock masses are \n\npresented in detail in ICOLD (1993). It is important to highlight that the majority of the tests \n\ninvolve relatively small volumes of the rock mass and thus test results must be carefully \n\nanalysed and interpreted in order to give useful information for both dam design and analysis \n\nof dam foundation performance. \n\nEmpirical rock mass classification systems for engineering purposes have been developed, \n\nsuch as the RMR (rock mass rating) system of Bieniawski and the Q (or NGI) system of \n\nBarton. These systems were originally established for the design of tunnels. Although \n\nextensions of the RMR have been proposed to cover the case of dam foundations and slopes \n\n(e.g. Romana 2004), their use in dam foundations is rare. In this respect, however, the \n\npercentage of core recovery, employed to classify cored boreholes, is a basic index of the \n\nquality of the rock mass which is extensively used. \n\nLaboratory investigations include rock classification tests, such as saturation water content, \n\nbulk density and porosity; the stress-strain and strength properties of intact rock; and the \n\ndeformation and strength properties of rock joints. Tests can also be carried out to measure \n\nthe hydraulic conductivity of both rock joints and intact rock. \n\n2.3 Fundamentals of fluid flow in continuum media \n\nIn the majority of the analyses presented in this study it is assumed that flow takes place in an \n\nequivalent continuum media under steady-state conditions, thus the fundamental equations \n\nwhich describe flow under these conditions are presented below.  \n\n2.3.1 Hydraulic head and hydraulic gradient \n\nWater moves from areas of higher energy to areas of lower energy. The total energy of a fluid \n\nelement with a unit weight is given by (Louis 1969): \n\ng\n\np\nzE\n\n2\n\nv\n2\n\n???\n?\n\n \n(2.5) \n\n\n\n   16 \n\nwhere: z = distance from some arbitrary datum [L]; p = fluid pressure at a certain point M \n\n[L\n-1\n\n M T\n-2\n\n]; ? = unit (or specific) weight of the fluid [L\n-2\n\n M T\n-2\n\n]; v = velocity of the fluid at M \n\n[L T\n-1\n\n]; and g = acceleration due to gravity [L T\n-2\n\n].  \n\nThe total energy per unit weight [L] can be divided in two parts:  \n\ni) total head \n\n?\n?\n\np\nz ??  \n\n(2.6) \n\nii) velocity head \n\ng2\n\nv\n2\n\n \n(2.7) \n\nThe total head, ?, also known as piezometric head, as hydraulic potential, as hydraulic head, \n\nor simply head, is usually represented by h. According to Equation 2.6 the total head is the \n\nsum of the elevation head (distance from some arbitrary datum) and the pressure head (fluid \n\npressure divided by the unit weight of the fluid). The pressure head represents the height of a \n\nfluid column capable, by its weight, of imposing pressure p. The velocity head represents the \n\nkinetic energy per weight unit, which means that it represents the height from which a fluid \n\nelement should fall, in vacuum, to attain velocity v. The velocity head may usually be \n\nneglected, and thus the total head provides a good approximation to the energy head (Wittke \n\n1990).  \n\nThe hydraulic potential and the kinetic energy vary from one point to another in a fluid. If it is \n\nassumed that flow takes place in steady-state conditions, they can be described as a function \n\nof space only. In a system of arbitrary coordinates (x,y,z), the total head of a fluid can thus be \n\nwritten as: \n\n?\n?\n\n),,(\n),,(),,(\n\nzyxp\nzyxzzyx ??  \n\n(2.8) \n\nThe hydraulic gradient J\n?\n\n is defined as minus the gradient of the hydraulic head:  \n\n),,( zyxadrgJ ?\n??\n\n??

(2.11) \n\n2.3.2 Extension of Darcy\u2019s experimental law to three-dimensional flows  \n\nDarcy\u2019s laboratory experiments were carried out with unidirectional flows. However, the \n\nexperimental law may be extended to three-dimensional flows in anisotropic and non-\n\nhomogeneous domains. In this case Darcy\u2019s law is written, in vector form, as (Bear 1988): \n\n?\n?\n\ngrad\np\n\nzgrad KK ????\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n???v\n\n?\n \n\n(2.12) \n\nor, in index notation: \n\n)3,2,1,(Kv ?\n?\n\n?\n?? ji\n\nx\nj\n\niji\n\n?\n \n\n(2.13) \n\nwhere vi are the components of Darcy velocity along x, y and z axis, and K is the hydraulic \n\nconductivity matrix, which is symmetrical and is expressed as a velocity. There is a system of \n\northogonal axis, known as principal axis, for which Kij = 0 for i ? j. \n\n2.3.3 Laplace equation in homogeneous media \n\nIn an isotropic media the hydraulic conductivity matrix K becomes a single scalar \n\n(K11 = K22 = K33 = kH) and the extended Darcy\u00b4s law (Equation 2.12) is written as: \n\nik\nH\n\n?v  \n\n??\nHH\n\nkgradgradk ????v\n?\n\n (2.14) \n\nGiven that  vx, vy, and vz are the components of Darcy velocity along x, y and z axis: \n\nz\nk\n\ny\nk\n\nx\nk\n\nHzHyHx\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n???\nv;v;v  \n\n(2.15) \n\nUsing the equation of continuity, which represents conservation of mass: \n\n0v0\nvvv\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n? ?\ndivor\n\nzyx\n\nzyx  \n(2.16) \n\n\n\n   18 \n\nthe Laplace equation is obtained; this expresses water movement in a homogeneous porous \n\nmedia: \n\n00\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n????\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n???\n\nzyx\n \n\n(2.17) \n\nWhen formulating Laplace equation it is assumed that: i) flow takes place in steady-state \n\nconditions; ii) water is incompressible; iii) the media is incompressible and homogeneous; \n\nand iv) flow is laminar. The assumption of incompressibility of water is acceptable under \n\ntypical subsurface conditions because, as the compressibility of water is only 4.9 \u00d7 10\n-10\n\n /Pa, a \n\npressure change of 1 MPa (10 bar) changes the density by only 0.05 % (Zimmerman and \n\nBodvarsson 1996). The assumption that flow is laminar is also adequate, as is going to be \n\nshown in section 2.5.2. \n\nFrom the analysis of Equation 2.17 it can be seen that the hydraulic conductivity kH is not in \n\nthe Laplace equation, which means that in an isotropic media the total piezometric head is \n\nindependent of permeability, being dependent only on the domain geometry and boundary \n\nconditions. \n\nAccording to Harr (1962), seepage analysis problems associated with embankment dams or \n\nconcrete dam foundations involve four possible types of boundaries (Table 2.2): i) impervious \n\nboundary; ii) entrances and exits; iii) seepage face; and iv) free surface. Therefore, boundary \n\nconditions can be defined by the hydraulic head value, ?, by the discharge, or by a free \n\nsurface condition. When the boundary condition is defined by the hydraulic head, the latter \n\ncan be constant: \n\n11\nh\n\nboundary\n??  (2.18) \n\nor it can vary along the boundary: \n\n)3,2,1()(\n2\n\n?? ixf\niboundary\n\n?  (2.19) \n\nThe seepage face is a particular case of this type of boundary condition, in which pressure is \n\nzero, and thus the hydraulic head equals the elevation head. \n\nIf the boundary condition is defined by the discharge: \n\n)3,2,1,(\n3\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n? jin\n\nx\nk\n\ni\n\nj\n\njiboundary\n\n?\n?  (2.20) \n\nwhere ni are the direction cosines of the normal to the surface. An impervious boundary is a \n\nparticular case of this boundary condition, where the discharge is zero. \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nBoundary condition Remarks \n\nImpervious The interface between the foundation and adjacent materials with very low \n\npermeability, such as concrete or a very low permeability soil, is simulated as an \n\nimpervious boundary. As no flow takes place across an impervious boundary flow \n\nin the pervious media next to the impervious boundary is parallel to that boundary. \n\nEntrances and exits The lines defining the area where water enters or leaves the pervious domain are \n\nknown as entrances and exits. Along these lines the hydraulic head is the same, \n\nregardless of their direction or shape. Flow is perpendicular to any entrance or exit. \n\nSeepage face In embankment dams, the saturated pervious soil mass may have a boundary \n\nexposed to the atmosphere and allows water to escape along this boundary. \n\nPressure along this surface is atmospheric. This boundary condition does not occur \n\nin concrete dams. \n\nFree surface This boundary, as for an impervious boundary, is not crossed by flow \n\n \n \n\nTable 2.2 \u2013 Types of boundaries in seepage analysis problems associated with embankment \n\ndams or concrete dam foundations. \n\nA free surface condition (or phreatic condition) is established by simultaneously imposing the \n\nhydraulic head (which is equal to the elevation head) and the value of the discharge (discharge \n\nnull): \n\n)3,2,1,(0\n\n)0(\n4\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\njin\nx\n\nk\n\npz\n\ni\n\nj\n\nji\n\nboundary\n\n?\n\n?\n\n \n\n(2.21) \n\nThe location of a free surface is a priori unknown and is part of the required solution. \n\nThe solution of a flow problem in a continuum media involves determining the distribution of \n\nthe hydraulic head in the domain under analysis in such a way that the equation of continuity \n\nand the boundary conditions are satisfied, which enables the evaluation of other flow factors \n\nand the mechanical effects of flow (Carmo Vaz 1979). \n\n2.4 Hydromechanical behaviour of rock joints \n\n2.4.1 Fluid flow in a single joint \n\nIt is essential to understand how fluid flows in rock joints in order to address the complex \n\nhydromechanical behaviour of concrete dam foundations, and this has been the subject of \n\nextensive research. The most commonly applied conceptual model for flow through a single \n\nfracture, known as the parallel plate model, represents the fracture as the void space between \n\ntwo parallel smooth plates (Louis 1969; Louis and Maini 1970; Snow 1965). The solution for \n\nsteady state laminar incompressible flow in such fracture geometry gives the mean velocity \n\nas: \n\nik\nf\n\n?v  (2.22) \n\n\n\n   20 \n\nwhere i = hydraulic gradient applied to the fluid (m/m), and the fracture hydraulic \n\nconductivity is given by \n\n?12\n\n2\nga\n\nk\nf\n?  \n\n(2.23) \n\nwhere a = fracture aperture (m); ? = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m\n2\n/s); and \n\ng = acceleration of gravity (m/s\n2\n).  The flow rate per unit width is thus expressed by the cubic \n\nlaw: \n\n?q v i\nga\n\na\n?12\n\n3\n\n?  \n(2.24) \n\nThus, the laminar discharge of parallel-plate openings is proportional to the cube of aperture, \n\nwhich means that it is extremely sensitive to the size of the aperture. \n\nNatural rock fractures are neither smooth nor parallel and thus several studies have been \n\ncarried out in order to establish whether the parallel plate model is adequate for the prediction \n\nof flow in natural fractures. Louis (1969) showed that the cubic law is essentially valid for \n\nlaminar flow in rock joints but proposed an empirical correction factor for this law in order to \n\naccount for fracture roughness. Lomitze, in 1951, and Barton and de Quadros (1997) also \n\nsuggested the use of an extra roughness coefficient, and similar formulas were proposed by \n\nthese researchers, with different correction factors due to the different samples of fractures \n\nthat were used: Lomitze used smooth glass plates with variable roughnessess, achieved by \n\nglueing sand grains to the surface, while Louis and Barton and de Quadros used different rock \n\nfractures.  \n\nMost of the studies suggested that better predictions could be obtained if the joint wall \n\nroughness and the regions where the joint walls touch were taken into account. The joint wall \n\nroughness leads to spatial variations in aperture and the contact between both fracture walls \n\nleads to partial obstruction of the flow. Witherspoon et al. (1980) stated that the apparent \n\nreduction in flow due to deviations from the parallel plate geometry could be incorporated \n\ninto the cubic law by multiplying the flow rate by a linear correction factor. Tsang and \n\nWitherspoon (1981) developed a physical model where the single fracture is represented by a \n\ncollection of voids and the closure of the fracture results from a deformation of these voids. \n\nThis model enabled fracture roughness to be characterized from a relationship between the \n\nstress-displacement measurements of intact rock and those of jointed rock, and these \n\nresearchers thus proposed the use of a weighted average aperture in the cubic law that leads to \n\nflow rate as a function of normal stress. Predicted flow rates using this model were close to \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nresults from laboratory data on granite and basalt. Neuzil and Tracy (1981) developed a \n\ndifferent model for flow in a fracture, where the fracture is represented by a set of parallel \n\nplate openings with different apertures, and they presented theoretical relationships between \n\nmean aperture and flow rate. They suggested the use of an aperture frequency distribution for \n\nthe fracture. Barton et al. (1985) suggested that a rock fracture has both a mechanical and a \n\nhydraulic aperture with an empirical relation that considers the joint roughness coefficient \n\n(JRC) and stated that the hydraulic aperture should be used in the cubic law.  \n\nThe concepts of mechanical and hydraulic aperture are particularly relevant. Olsson and \n\nBarton (2001) defined the mechanical joint aperture (E) as the average point-to-point distance \n\nbetween two rock joint surfaces, perpendicular to a selected plane. A single value can be used \n\nto define the aperture, but it can also be described stochastically. The aperture distribution is \n\nonly valid at a certain state of stress and pore pressure. The mechanical aperture is usually \n\ndetermined from a two dimensional (2D) joint section, which is only a part of the real 3D \n\nsurface. The hydraulic aperture (e) is measured by analysing the fluid flow and can be \n\ndetermined both from laboratory fluid flow experiments and borehole pumping tests in the \n\nfield. Barton et al. (1985) proposed a nonlinear empirical correlation between hydraulic and \n\nmechanical aperture.  \n\nAccording to Liu (2005) the assumption that the hydraulic and mechanical apertures are equal \n\nhas been shown to be a good approximation for a high flow rate and large apertures, but \n\nlaboratory data and numerical experiments suggest that the approximation breaks down as the \n\nstress acting perpendicular to the fracture plane results in fracture apertures approaching the \n\nscale of the surface roughness. The hydraulic aperture is always less than the mechanical \n\naperture and their ratio depends crucially on the fracture roughness. \n\n2.4.2 Hydromechanical behaviour during joint normal closure \n\nThe influence of normal stress on the aperture and flow behaviour of rock joints has been the \n\nsubject of extensive research (e.g. Barton and de Quadros 1997; Barton et al. 1985; \n\nCammarata et al. 2007; Cook 1992; Gale et al. 1994; Hans and Boulon 2003; Kulatilake et al. \n\n2008; Li et al. 2008; Londe and Sabarly 1966; Lopez et al. 2007; Marache et al. 2008; Neuzil \n\nand Tracy 1981; Noorishad et al. 1992; Pyrak-Nolte and Morris 2000; Rutqvist et al. 1992; \n\nSisavath et al. 2003; Tsang and Witherspoon 1981; Witherspoon et al. 1980).  \n\nThe typical mechanical and hydromechanical behaviour of rock joints under normal stress is \n\nshown in Figure 2.3. The normal deformation is non-linear (Figure 2.3 a) and the rate of \n\ndeformation is greater at low normal stress, which means that fracture stiffness increases with \n\nincreasing effective normal stress. The same figure shows there is a scale effect and that the \n\nmaximum joint closure increases with sample size (Yoshinaka et al. 1993).  \n\n\n\n   22 \n\nRegarding the hydromechanical behaviour, experimental results show that there is a decrease \n\nin fracture transmissivity with normal stress, but there is an apparent residual transmissivity \n\n(Tr) at high stress when the fracture appears to be mechanically compressed (Figure 2.3 b). \n\nThe transmissivity (T) of a fracture with an aperture a and hydraulic conductivity kf is given \n\nby: \n\nakT\nf\n\n?  (2.25) \n\nThe residual transmissivity indicates that the fluid flow at high stress may be dominated by \n\ntube-like flow channels, which cannot be closed easily (Rutqvist and Stephansson 2003). This \n\neffect led Witherspoon et al. (1980) to introduce the concept of \u201cresidual hydraulic aperture\u201d. \n\nThe phenomenon of size effect for normal closure, which indicates that fracture hydraulic \n\nconductivity increases with specimen size, has been suggested by several researchers based \n\nboth on experimental data (Witherspoon et al. 1980; Yoshinaka et al. 1993) and on theoretical \n\nstudies (e.g. Neuzil and Tracy 1981). \n\nSeveral constitutive models that simulate joint normal closure have been developed, (Bandis \n\net al. 1983; Barton et al. 1985; Goodman 1974) of which the most commonly applied is the \n\nhyperbolic function developed by Bandis. \n\n \n\n \n\n  a)          b) \n\n \n\n \n\n?\u2019n \u2013 effective fracture normal stress \n\n?\u2019ni \u2013 effective fracture normal stress \n\n          at initial conditions \n\nkn0 \u2013 fracture normal stiffness at zero \n\n         normal stress \n\nkni \u2013 fracture normal stiffness at an  \n\n        initial effective stress \n\n?un \u2013 fracture normal displacement \n\n?us \u2013 fracture shear displacement \n\n? \u2013 fracture normal closure \n\n?max \u2013 maximum fracture normal closure \n\nT \u2013 fluid transmissivity \n\nTr \u2013 residual transmissivity at high  \n\n       compressive stress  \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Typical mechanical (a) and hydromechanical (b) fracture responses under normal \n\nclosure.

This separation during shear displacement causes an increase in joint hydraulic \n\napertures and consequently an increase in joint permeability. This effect on joint permeability \n\nhas been analysed both theoretically (e.g. Barton et al. 1985; Bawden et al. 1980) and \n\nexperimentally (e.g. Chen et al. 2000; Esaki et al. 1999; Olsson and Barton 2001; Yeo et al. \n\n1998). \n\nFigure 2.4 shows the typical mechanical and hydromechanical behaviour of clean, rough, \n\ndilatant rock joints under constant normal stress. Regarding the mechanical behaviour, there is \n\na rapid increase in shear stress up to a peak, followed by a loss in load-carrying capacity. The \n\nshear displacement is accompanied by shear dilation, as shown in the lower curves of Figure \n\n2.4 a). During elastic deformation of the fracture, there is minimum dilation. The onset of \n\nrapid dilation occurs when asperities begin to slide against each other. The rate of dilation \n\n(slope of ?un curve) increases and reaches a maximum, which is known as the peak shear \n\nstress (Barton et al 1985). There is also a scale effect: for a larger sample, the peak shear \n\nstress is smaller and takes place after a larger shear displacement. The onset of shear dilation \n\nis delayed in larger samples because a larger displacement is required to reach peak shear \n\nstress. \n\nConcerning the hydromechanical behaviour, laboratory experiments show that decreases in \n\nhydraulic  conductivity  during  shear  displacement  are  a  result  of gouge production, which \n\n \n\n \n\na)           b)  \n\n?s \u2013 shear stress \n\n?s\nPeak\n\n \u2013 peak shear stress (strength) \n\nks \u2013 fracture shear stiffness \n\n?un \u2013 fracture normal displacement \n\n?us \u2013 fracture shear displacement \n\nT \u2013 fluid transmissivity \n\nT0 \u2013 fluid transmissivity at zero  \n\n       shear displacement \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Typical mechanical (a) and hydromechanical (b) fracture responses under shear \n\nstress.

The increase in aperture due to dilatancy has the opposite effect. \n\nThe tests carried out on granite by Esaki et al. (1999) and by Olsson and Barton (2001) show \n\nthat the joint transmissivity starts to increase after about 1 mm of shear displacement and then \n\nincreases rapidly by about 1-2 orders of magnitude up to 5 mm. Afterwards, curves tend to be \n\nflat and any further shear displacement may give rise to relatively small changes in \n\npermeability (Figure 2.4 b). It is worth noting that little experimental work exists on the effect \n\nof shear deformation on rock joints\u2019 hydraulic conductivity due to difficulties involved in \n\ncarrying out this kind of test. \n\nConstitutive models for hydromechanical coupling during shear displacement of rock joints, \n\nwith the hydraulic aperture given as a function of the real mechanical aperture and the joint \n\nroughness coefficient (JRC), were developed by Barton et al. (1985) and by Olsson and \n\nBarton (2001).  \n\n2.5 Specific features of concrete dam foundations \n\nConcrete dam foundation rock masses usually need treatment to satisfy the requirements of \n\nstability, deformation and low permeability. Ground improvement works depend significantly \n\non the type and size of the dam, and are essential to the structure\u2019s safety. Different measures \n\nare available to: i) increase foundation shear strength, stability of abutments and foundation \n\nstiffness; ii) improve the contact between the dam concrete and the foundation rock mass, and \n\niii) reduce both the quantity of water flowing through the foundation and uplift pressures. A \n\ndetailed description of available methods of foundation treatment is presented in ICOLD \n\n(1993; 2005). The uppermost strata of the foundation rock mass is often strengthened with \n\nconsolidation grouting which increases the rock mass deformation modulus in the area close \n\nto the base of the dam and thus contributes to reducing deformation due to subsequent dam \n\nloading. Another important objective of consolidation grouting is to seal some of the \n\ndiscontinuities close to the dam/foundation interface, which, as a result of excavation works, \n\nis usually a more pervious area than the rock mass at depth. Treatment by both sealing and \n\ndrainage measures is particularly relevant in hydraulic and hydromechanical analysis of \n\nconcrete dam foundations and thus this issue is addressed below. \n\nDam construction and the subsequent filling of the reservoir transmit large loads to the \n\nfoundation and cause changes in the aperture of the discontinuities through which water \n\nflows, both upstream and downstream from the dam, modifying the natural flow pattern. The \n\nrock mass in the vicinity of the dam becomes subject to a large difference in hydraulic head \n\nbetween the upstream and downstream areas (large hydraulic gradient). In addition, the cyclic \n\nvariation in both reservoir level and ambient temperature contribute to continuous change in \n\nflow paths (variations in ambient temperature cause changes in the structure\u2019s temperature, \n\nwhich may give rise to dam displacements that affect the dam foundation deformation, and \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nthus the aperture of the discontinuities through which water flows). The flow regime under \n\nthese conditions has been studied by some researchers, and this issue is also addressed here. \n\n2.5.1 Grout curtains and drainage systems \n\nSeepage through the foundation and abutments is a major concern in concrete dams. Seepage \n\ncontrol, necessary to prevent excessive uplift pressures and erosion of material in open joints, \n\nis usually made with grout curtains and drainage systems (Figure 2.5). A grout curtain creates \n\na solid mass through which it is more difficult for groundwater to flow, so it reduces seepage \n\nunder the dam. The drainage curtain is usually a line of boreholes drilled downstream from \n\nthe grout curtain to collect and control seepage under the dam and so reduce the uplift. \n\nReduction of uplift water pressures increases effective stresses and consequently leads to \n\nincreased safety.  \n\nThe most widespread method to reduce the hydraulic conductivity of an area of the rock mass \n\nfoundation is cement-based injection grouting. A grout curtain underneath a dam is usually \n\nconstructed by a series of grout holes aligned in a single row, but in some cases it may include \n\ntwo or even more adjacent rows. These are usually drilled from the drainage gallery, close to \n\nthe upstream face of the dam. In arch dams, special care must be taken in order not to locate \n\nthese boreholes in the area of tensile stresses that usually develop within the rock mass, below \n\nthe heel of the dam. The first holes grouted, called primary holes, are commonly spaced 10 to \n\n12 m apart, so the grouting of any of these holes usually does not interfere with the grouting \n\nof  the  adjacent  ones. The  following series  of  holes  grouted (secondary holes)  are  located \n\n \n\nTailwater level\n\nReservoir level\n\ndrainage\ncurtain\n\ngrout\ncurtain\n\n \n\n \n \n\nDrainage boreholes in the gallery of a concrete \n\ndam. The grout holes were drilled from the gutter, \n\nwhich is filled with water, as shown in the photo.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Grout curtains and drainage systems in concrete dam foundations. \n\n\n\n   26 \n\nmidway between the primary holes, and the next series (tertiary holes) midway between the \n\nsecondary and primary holes. Additional grout holes may be necessary if the permeability has \n\nnot yet been reduced to the desired level. Before grouting, water pressure tests are carried out \n\nin each borehole and the decision regarding the necessity of additional grouting is usually \n\nbased on a permeability criterion. In this way, it is possible to form a continuous curtain or \n\nbulb of grouted rock and thus reduce the rock mass permeability in that area. Special care \n\nmust be taken with grouting pressures, in order not to cause further opening of the \n\ndiscontinuities or enlargement of voids within the foundation. In a generally sound \n\nfoundation, a typical grout curtain varies in depth from about 0.35 to 0.75 H, where H is the \n\nheight of the reservoir above the top of the grout curtain. \n\nThe drainage curtain is usually drilled from the drainage gallery. In some cases, however, \n\nsuch as in thin arch dams without galleries, it may be drilled either from the downstream face \n\nof the dam or from the rock mass surface close to the toe of the dam. Drainage boreholes are \n\ndrilled after grouting is complete, to minimize the risk of filling the holes with grout. The \n\nusual diameter of drainage boreholes is 76 mm, and they are typically located 1.5 to 5 m \n\napart. As a general rule, drainage borehole depths vary from 20 to 40 % of the water head, and \n\nfrom 35 to 70 % of the grout curtain depth (Wyllie 1999). The drain holes may be uncased, \n\nwhen drilled in sound rock, or cased with perforated plastic casing in fractured rock, which \n\nwill keep the hole open and prevent the rock becoming loose from the borehole walls. \n\nDrainage in a concrete dam foundation is always relevant, and is of particular importance in \n\njointed rock masses with discontinuities with a very small aperture where high water \n\npressures may develop over time. \n\n2.5.2 Flow regime in concrete dam foundations \n\nSome of the studies that have been carried out concerning the flow regime in concrete dam \n\nfoundations are briefly presented below. \n\nThe boundaries between different flow regimes (laminar and turbulent) within rock fissures \n\nare dependent on the relative roughness and on the Reynolds number (Louis 1969). The \n\nrelative roughness is given by k/Dh, where k is the absolute roughness of the fissure walls \n\n(asperity height) and Dh is the hydraulic diameter of the fissure, equal to four times the \n\nhydraulic radius (defined as the area over the perimeter of the conduit), or equal to two times \n\nthe fissure aperture, if it is assumed that the width of the cross section of the fissure through \n\nwhich the flow occurs is much greater that its aperture. The relative roughness varies between \n\n0 for a smooth fissure and 0.5 when the asperity (roughness) height is equal to the fissure \n\naperture. The Reynolds number is given by: \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n?\n\nv\nR\n\ne\nh\n\nD\n?  \n\n(2.26) \n\nwhere Dh = hydraulic diameter of the fissure; v  = mean flow velocity in the fissure and \n\n? = kinematic viscosity of the water.    \n\nStudies carried out by Louis (1969) led to the conclusion that flow in a joint is parallel for \n\nrelative roughnesses lower than 0.033. In this case, based on test results and on information \n\navailable from the literature, Louis assumed that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow \n\noccurred at the Reynolds number of 2300 (critical Reynolds number). For non-parallel flows, \n\ni.e. for relative roughnesses higher than 0.033, the critical Reynolds number depended on the \n\nfissure roughness, decreasing with the increase in roughness. The flow laws describe the \n\nrelation between the Reynolds number and the dimensionless resistance coefficient ? (Louis \n\n1969). Louis compiled the different flow laws and indicated their range of validity, as shown \n\nin Figure 2.6. In this figure, the various regions in which different types of flow occur are \n\nnumbered from I to V. Two different flow laws are shown in Figure 2.6: the first, in region I, \n\nis the law of resistance for the isothermic laminar flow of a viscous, incompressible fluid \n\nthrough narrow joints; and the second, in region IV, is the law of resistance proposed by \n\nLouis for laminar flow within a rough fissure.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Laws for 1-dimensional flow in a fissure, presented by Louis (1969) (after \n\nGoodman et al. 1983). \n\n\n\n   28 \n\nLouis stated that the relative roughness of natural rock joints is generally greater than 0.033 \n\nand highlighted that in nature rock joints are quite often filled with soil materials, such as clay \n\nor sand, caused by weathering, tectonic action and sedimentation, and that, in such cases, the \n\nflow in the joints can be considered laminar and described with Darcy\u2019s law. \n\nFranciss (1970) studied the hydraulic behaviour of undeformable fissured systems in a linear \n\nsteady state in order to understand better water movement through jointed rock masses. His \n\nresearch included a theoretical study about the hydraulic conductivity of jointed media, in \n\nwhich he took into account the results that had been presented by Louis (1969), and which led \n\nhim to the conclusion that flow is predominantly laminar in a rock mass in which the average \n\naperture of the discontinuities is lower than 1 mm and the hydraulic gradient lower than 10 \n\n(Figure 2.7). In addition, he statistically analysed the results of 377 Lugeon type tests carried \n\nout at various depths in the foundations (mainly granitic) of three different dams in Brazil, \n\nand the results of the study indicated that flow was laminar in between 62.9 and 80.4 % of the \n\ntests. He therefore concluded that for the hydraulic gradients observed in dam foundations, \n\nlargely due to the discontinuous nature of seepage paths, seepage velocities are generally low \n\nenough for laminar flow to be established, even in fissures with significant hydraulic \n\napertures. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nHydraulic gradient \n\nA\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n a\n\np\ne\nrt\n\nu\nre\n\n o\nf \n\nth\ne\n d\n\nis\nc\no\n\nn\nti\n\nn\nu\n\nit\nie\n\ns \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Transition from laminar to turbulent flow (after Franciss 1970). \n\n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nWittke (1990) analysed the influence of turbulence on the numerical results in detail. For this, \n\nhe compared the results of two flow tests carried out with plexiglass models, which simulated \n\njointed rock masses, with the results of discrete models. Devices for measuring the \n\npiezometric head were installed at various points within each of the experimental \n\narrangements, to determine the potential distribution. The first model simulated a slope in a \n\nrock mass crossed by two sets of discontinuities, in which the height of the water table in one \n\nof the discontinuities, located far away from the slope\u2019s surface, remained constant. Such a \n\nboundary condition could represent, for example, a fault with a large aperture, into which \n\nwater from remote areas could flow freely. In this model, the discharge from individual \n\ndiscontinuities at the slope face could be measured. The second model simulated the flow into \n\na tunnel in a slope of jointed rock. In both models, the apertures and the discontinuity \n\nspacings were relatively large, when compared with the models\u2019 other dimensions. \n\nThe experimental potential distributions were compared with those obtained with numerical \n\nmodels, in which laminar flow was initially assumed. Taking into account the gradients \n\ncalculated for individual sections of discontinuity, the flow in various sections was found to \n\nbe turbulent. Thus, the equations valid for turbulent flow were afterwards considered, and \n\nadditional numerical results were obtained. Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9 show the comparison \n\nbetween test and numerical results for both the studied cases. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 Flow through a slope. Comparison of the results from a model test and from \n\ncomputations: a) distribution of piezometric head; b) flow conditions; and c) seepage water \n\ndischarges (after Wittke 1990).  \n\n\n\n   30 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Flow into a tunnel. Comparison of the results from a model test and from \n\ncomputations: a) details of problem; b) distribution of piezometric head; and c) states of flow \n\n(after Wittke 1990). \n\nBoth figures show that the numerical piezometric heads are very close to those measured and \n\nthat the consideration of turbulence does not significantly alter the potential distribution. \n\nWittke stated that the deviations between the calculated and measured potentials could be \n\nexplained by the large aperture of the discontinuities in relation to the length of individual \n\nsections of discontinuity. Consequently, the velocity of flow became so large that the energy \n\nlosses arising at the points of intersection between the two sets of discontinuities could no \n\nlonger be neglected. Wittke highlighted that the velocities of flow are considerably lower in \n\npractical problems, and both the energy losses at intersections and the proportion of \n\ndiscontinuity sections containing turbulent flow are therefore less. In the case of flow through \n\na slope, the difference between the measured discharges and those calculated on the \n\nassumption of part turbulent and part laminar flow was 8.6 %.   \n\nFrom these comparative investigations, Wittke concluded that the neglecting of turbulence \n\ngenerally has little influence on the potential distribution, and thus neither on the forces \n\nresulting from flow through the rock mass.  \n\nFrom the study carried out general conclusions which also apply to concrete dam foundations \n\ncan be drawn. Wittke stated that the consideration of turbulence may only become significant \n\nif seepage water discharges need to be determined accurately, and highlighted that turbulent \n\nflow scarcely arises in problems involving natural rock masses. He added that the statements \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nconcerning the aperture of individual discontinuities are always associated with scatter, \n\nwhich, in practical cases, has a far greater effect on the calculated seepage water discharges \n\nthan differences due to the state of flow. He also concluded that the seepage flow in a rock \n\nmass is steady and approximately laminar in most rock engineering problems, and \n\nconsequently, problems in which the discontinuities are spaced closely with respect to the \n\nstructure\u2019s dimensions may be solved using the generalized Darcy\u2019s law. \n\nZimmerman and Bodvarsson (1996) show that the laminar solution given by the cubic law is \n\nstable when: \n\n4\n\n2\n13800\n\nh\np\n\n?\n\n?\n??  \n\n(2.27) \n\nwhere p?  = average magnitude of the pressure gradient; ? = dynamic viscosity of the fluid; \n\n? = fluid density; and h = joint aperture. This expression is obtained from both the average \n\nvelocity of fluid flow through the fracture and the Reynolds number at which flow changes \n\nfrom laminar to turbulent (critical Reynolds number), and shows that high viscosity, low fluid \n\ndensity and small apertures all tend to stabilize the flow field. The above mentioned \n\nresearchers state that this stability condition is satisfied in most subsurface flow situations and \n\ngive the example of water with a dynamic viscosity of 10\n-3\n\n N s/m\n2\n (10\n\n-3\n Pa \n\n.\n s) and a density \n\nof 10\n3\n kg/m\n\n3\n, which are the approximate values at 20\u00b0C. In this case, even for apertures as \n\nlarge as 10\n-3\n\n m, laminar flow will be stable for pressure gradients as high as about \n\n1.4 \u00d7 10\n7\n Pa/m. This gradient is equivalent to about 14 MPa/m (140 bars/m), which is much \n\nlarger than the gradients typically encountered in dam foundations. They add, however, that \n\nfor a real rough-walled fracture, inertia effects due to tortuous flow paths will lead to \n\ndeviations from the cubic law long before genuine turbulence occurs, i.e., at lower flow rates. \n\nThey conclude that, in this case, flow is laminar for pressure gradients lower than 10\n4\n Pa/m, \n\nwhich is about 0.1 bar/m. This critical gradient is larger than most naturally-occurring \n\ngroundwater potential gradients. \n\nIf there were a continuous rock joint with an aperture of 1 mm close to a dam/foundation \n\ninterface, developing within the rock mass from the heel to the toe of the dam, the gradient \n\ncould be higher than 0.1 bar/m. In reality, water usually flows through a network of \n\ninterconnected discontinuities, whose apertures are smaller than 1 mm, and therefore laminar \n\nflow may be assumed. Indeed, according to Barton et al. (1985) numerous tests performed at \n\nUS dam sites in the depth range 0-60 m indicated that most conducting apertures were in the \n\nrange of 50-150 ?m at this shallow depth. \n\n \n\n\n\n   32 \n\n2.5.3 Main problems usually found in the behaviour of concrete dam \nfoundations \n\nThe role of the foundation in the safety of concrete dams is highlighted in the first chapter. It \n\nis mentioned that the majority of recorded failures were due to problems in the foundation \n\nrock mass such as those due to weathering processes that lead to a loss of strength, with \n\nsubsurface erosion and dissolution being the most significant, and lack of shear resistance in \n\nrock masses\u2019 weak planes of unfavourable direction.  \n\nThere are a large number of reported cases of dam failure due to the rock mass foundation \n\nbehaviour or to deficient foundation treatment, of which the most well-known case is the \n\nfailure of the 61 m high Malpasset dam, in France in 1959, which was the first failure of an \n\narch dam. The failure occurred shortly before the first filling of the reservoir was completed. \n\nAfter many years of research it was concluded that the accident could be satisfactorily \n\nexplained by the development of full uplift pressures deep in the foundation rock (Londe \n\n1985). These high pressures could have built up due to two simultaneous factors: i) on the left \n\nbank the thrust was applied in the direction of the rock schistosity and a crack opening along \n\nthe schistosity allowed hydrostatic pressure to be installed to a great depth; and ii) rock mass \n\npermeability was highly sensitive to stress, and was reduced by a factor of approximately 0.01 \n\ndue to dam load (Figure 2.10 a).  This phenomenon, which was previously unknown, created \n\na hydraulic barrier under the dam which was subjected to high water pressures, and \n\ncontributed to failure by causing a wedge of rock in the foundation of the left abutment to \n\nslide along a fault located under the structure. Investigation carried out after the failure of \n\nMalpasset dam led to a consensus among dam engineers that most arch dam foundations \n\nshould be drained to a deep level and the drainage efficiency checked by an adequate network \n\nof piezometers.  \n\nWittke (1990) presented a modified hypothesis for the failure of the Malpasset dam, based on \n\nthe results of numerical analysis carried out with a three-dimensional finite element (FE) \n\nmodel. The basic failure mechanism was the same as that suggested by Londe, but Wittke \n\nassumed an isotropic rock mass permeability, not taking into account the results of laboratory \n\npermeability tests carried out after the failure which indicated that the permeability was stress-\n\ndependent. Numerical analysis carried out taking into account seepage and uplift showed that \n\ndue to construction and reservoir filling tensile stresses arose in the left abutment and valley \n\nfloor in a direction perpendicular to that of the schistosity. The isotropic elastic analysis also \n\nindicated shear stresses on the discontinuities downstream from the dam which acted \n\nupwards, showing a tendency of the rock mass immediately below the dam to slide \n\ndownstream.  He suggested that the tensile stresses on the schistosity led to the formation of a \n\ncrack in the left abutment immediately upstream from the dam in which the hydrostatic \n\npressure built up. The great variation in hydraulic head within the rock mass between the \n\n\n\n 33 \n\ncrack and the area downstream from the dam gave rise to high seepage pressures which \n\nincreased the tendency of the rock mass to slide towards downstream (Figure 2.10 b). This \n\nhypothesis was based on the observation of a crack within the rock mass immediately \n\nupstream from the heel of the dam, as shown in Alonso (2005). \n\nIn Portugal, although a high percentage of concrete dams have been affected by different \n\ntypes of deterioration, both in the dam body and in the foundation, there has never been an \n\naccident with this type of dams. The following paragraphs include a brief summary of the \n\nmain cases of foundation deterioration observed in our country (LNEC 1999a; Mascarenhas \n\n1991; Pedro 1999a; Pedro 2001; Pedro et al. 1989; Ramos 2008). Reported cases concern the \n\nfoundation of arch dams of different ages, with different geometrical and geotechnical \n\ncharacteristics (Figure 2.11): the cases of Varosa and Vilarinho das Furnas dams, due to grout \n\ncurtains\u2019 lack of resistance to tensile stresses; the cases of Funcho and Ode\u00e1xere dams, due to \n\nproblems related with foundation treatment; the case of Bou\u00e7\u00e3 dam, due to erosion; and the \n\ncase of Venda Nova dam, due to both erosion and dissolution.  \n\nVarosa dam is located on the river Varosa, in the North of Portugal. It is a double curvature \n\narch dam with a maximum height of 76 m, 213 m of development at the crest, and the \n\nthickness varies in the central cantilever from 12 m at the base to 3.5 m at the crest. The \n\nfoundation consists of fresh to moderately weathered granite, crossed by joints with a \n\nrelatively low resistance. The dam construction ended in the middle of 1976 and the first \n\nfilling of the reservoir took about a year, from the end of 1976 until the end of 1977. In this \n\ndam, shortly after  the  first filling  of  the reservoir  had been completed, high uplift pressures  \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 - Failure at the Malpasset dam, in France, in 1959: a) Londe\u2019s hypothesis (after \n\nRutqvist and Stephansson 2003), and b) Wittke\u2019s modified hypothesis (after Wittke 1990). \n\n\n\n   34 \n\nwere observed in the left bank and particularly in the valley bottom, where the percentages of \n\nhydraulic head were 100 % close to the heel of the dam and extended towards downstream \n\nwith values higher than 80 % (percentage of hydraulic head is the ratio of the water head \n\nmeasured at a given level, expressed in metres of height of water, to the height of water in the \n\nreservoir above that level). New drains were drilled in the central area, which allowed a \n\ndecrease in uplift pressures, but around 5 years later, in 1983, an increase in the reservoir level \n\nuntil it was full led to a significant increase in discharges in the bottom of the valley, which \n\ntended to increase still further with the water at a stabilized level. In this case it was \n\nconcluded that the successive loading/unloading cycles due to an operating regime with large \n\ndaily variations of the water level in the reservoir damaged the grout curtain. Comprehensive \n\nanalysis showed that the development of high tensile stresses upstream from the dam had led \n\nto the opening of the superficial joints and had damaged the grout curtain, in an area less than \n\n1 m deep. Repair work was carried out with both cement grout and acrylic resin. \n\nVilarinho das Furnas dam, concluded in the end of 1971, is located on the River Homem, in \n\nthe North of Portugal. It is a double curvature arch with a maximum height of 94 m and a total \n\nlength between the abutments at the crest elevation of 384.5 m. The foundation consists of \n\ngranite, crossed by veins of quartz and dolerite. In 1977 excessively high water pressures \n\nwere recorded in the valley bottom and at the base of the right slope, and this was observed \n\nagain on several occasions. Some measures have been taken over time, namely the drilling of \n\nadditional drainage boreholes, in 1977 and 1983, grouting works, in 1980, and cleaning of \n\nboth drainage and piezometric systems, in 1983. Additional monitoring equipment \n\n(piezometers and foundation extensometers) was installed in 1987 so as to better evaluate the \n\nhydromechanical behaviour of the dam foundation. Comprehensive analysis of dam behaviour \n\nshowed that the grout curtain opens when two phenomena occur simultaneously: i) reservoir \n\nclose to the retention water level and ii) low concrete temperature. The decision was made not \n\nto carry out any foundation treatment but to avoid high reservoir levels during the months in \n\nwhich the concrete temperature is low. After this change in the operating regime no more \n\nopenings of the grout curtain were observed.  \n\nOde\u00e1xere dam, located in the South of Portugal, is a double curvature arch concluded in 1958 \n\nwith a maximum height of 41 m and a total crest length of 150 m. The foundation consists of \n\nschist and greywacke and is very deformable, especially in the right bank. In 1967, one of the \n\nblocks in the right abutment showed a non-reversible displacement while in the left bank \n\nsignificant seepage was detected under the wing wall of the abutment. Lugeon type tests \n\npointed out the presence of a badly consolidated zone showing high permeability. Grouting \n\nwas carried out in order to achieve the required consolidation and watertightness. \n\nFuncho dam, located on the River Arade in the South of Portugal, is a 49 m high double \n\ncurvature arch with 165 m  of  development at the crest and  a  width that varies, in the central \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n  \n\nVarosa dam Vilarinho das Furnas dam \n\n  \n\nOde\u00e1xere dam Funcho dam \n\n  \n\nBou\u00e7\u00e3 dam Venda Nova dam \n\nFigure 2.11 \u2013 Portuguese dams which had problems due to foundation deterioration. \n\n \n\n\n\n   36 \n\ncantilever, from 6.5 m at the base to 2.25 m at the crest. The foundation rock mass, highly \n\nheterogeneous  and  anisotropic, consists  of  schist and greywacke (DGRAH 1978). The dam \n\nconstruction ended in 1991 and the first filling of the reservoir, which started at the beginning \n\nof November 1992, was only concluded in January 2001. The long period taken for the first \n\nfilling of the reservoir was due to  the  need  for  successive foundation treatments, which \n\nmade  it  necessary to hold the filling (LNEC 2005a). Although relatively high permeability \n\nvalues were obtained in Lugeon type tests carried out in the schistose area, it was extremely \n\ndifficult to seal the discontinuities with cement grout, due to their small aperture and to \n\nfurther weathering of the rock mass when subjected to the induced pressures. In some areas, \n\nsealing of the discontinuities could only be achieved with an acrylic resin, whose use is \n\ncurrently forbidden due to its toxicity. This case is mentioned again in chapter 4, as an \n\nexample of a dam where the use of in situ tests similar to those in this study was of major \n\nimportance in deciding the treatment to be carried out. \n\nBou\u00e7a dam, located on the river Z\u00eazere in the central region of Portugal, is a double curvature \n\narch concluded in 1955, 70 m high, with a crest length of 171 m and of which the thickness \n\nvaries from 7.5 m at the base to 0.9 m at the crest. The foundation consists mainly of granite \n\nand of hornfels. In Bou\u00e7\u00e3 dam foundation, deterioration was due to progressive clogging of \n\nthe drainage system during a period of over 30 years. Hydrochemical analysis of the drained \n\nwater showed mechanical wear of the joint surfaces and of the material inside some faults. \n\nVenda Nova arch-gravity dam, concluded in 1951, is located on the river Rabag\u00e3o, in the \n\nnorth of Portugal, and has a maximum height of 97 m, and a total length of 345 m between \n\nthe abutments at the crest elevation. The foundation consists of granite, except in the upper \n\npart of the right bank in which there are hornfels. It is crossed by many joints and faults, filled \n\nwith clay and mylonite. The dam has a peripheral joint in the upstream area of the \n\ndam/foundation interface, introduced with the aim of reducing tensile stresses in the rock \n\nmass upper area. The rock mass was subjected to cyclic loads and the peripheral joint did not \n\nbehave properly, and, as in the above-mentioned case of Varosa dam, the grout curtain was \n\ndamaged due to high tensile stresses in the rock mass. In this case, however, grout curtain \n\ndeterioration progressed over the years, giving rise to the opening of horizontal joints and \n\nleading to a progressive increase in discharges, which went up to around 850 l/min. At the \n\nsame time, due to the high quantity of water flowing through the foundation, there was a \n\nsignificant increase in erosion and physical-chemical deterioration, which contributed to the \n\nincrease in permeability in the upstream foundation area. Treatment was carried out with \n\ncement grout and acrylic resin. \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n2.6 Numerical modelling \n\n2.6.1 Continuum equivalent and discontinuum models \n\nThere are two different modelling approaches to simulate hydromechanical coupling \n\nbehaviour of fractured rock masses. The first is based on an equivalent continuum and the \n\nsecond on discrete fracture networks. The choice of continuum or discontinuum approach \n\ndepends on many case-specific factors, mainly on the size and spacing of the discontinuities \n\nwhen compared to the size of the problem, and on the jointing pattern. The two different types \n\nof models may be combined and in this case it is called a hybrid model. This allows some of \n\nthe disadvantages of each type of model to be avoided. Different numerical models are \n\nusually used for each modelling approach. \n\nIn equivalent continuum models, materials\u2019 properties have to be adjusted in such a way that \n\nthe major characteristics of the rock mass\u2019s physical behaviour are properly represented. \n\nRegarding fluid flow, the equivalent permeability of the different rock mass areas may be \n\nestimated from the results of Lugeon type tests. The seepage forces induce deformations in \n\nthe continuous medium, which alters the permeability. This type of analysis requires \n\ncorrelations between stress or strain and permeability to be previously established.  \n\nIn fracture flow models the discontinuities are explicitly represented, with their individual \n\nhydromechanical properties. The flow of water is usually assumed to occur only through the \n\njoints. The joint water pressure gives rise to changes in joint apertures and, consequently, \n\nchanges in flow rates. Discontinuum modelling of the hydromechanical behaviour of jointed \n\nrock masses requires field, hydraulic and mechanical characterization data, such as orientation \n\nand spacing of discontinuities, joint normal stiffness, joint apertures and residual aperture, \n\nwhich is not readily available. \n\n2.6.2 Models to study the hydraulic and hydromechanical behaviour of dam \nfoundations \n\n2.6.2.1 Analytical solutions and experimental techniques \n\nThe first theoretical study about seepage in rock masses with drainage systems was presented \n\nby O. Hoffman in 1928. The study was based upon the results presented by Forchheimer \n\nabout eleven years before, in which the theory of seepage through porous media and a \n\ngraphical method for the solution of Laplace equation were presented (differential equation \n\nwhich describes the behaviour of fluids in a homogeneous media). In the 1930s and 1940s \n\nseveral studies were published with exact solutions to determine the piezometric surfaces in \n\nhomogeneous and isotropic foundations, with different cases of grouting and drainage \n\n(Terzaghi, Weaver, (Muskat 1946), Dachler, among others). \n\n\n\n   38 \n\nThese models were being developed while an intensive discussion regarding uplift pressures \n\nwas taking place. The development of the different hypotheses assumed to determine the \n\ndistribution of water pressures in dam foundations can be found in Serafim (1954), Smith \n\n(1971),  Andrade (1982), and Schnitter (1994). Until the middle of the 19th century the effect \n\nof the uplift pressure was not taken into account neither in the dam body nor in its foundation. \n\nThe effects of uplift pressures started to receive attention in around 1875 from Belgian \n\nengineers, and became a subject of debate after the failure of Bouzey gravity dam in France in \n\n1895, due to seepage through the masonry. Particularly relevant is the study presented in the \n\nsame year by L\u00e9vy (1895) in which he suggested a new design criterion in order to avoid the \n\ninflow of water into the dam masonry joints: he stated that the compression at the joint end in \n\nthe upstream face should be higher than the reservoir water pressure at that point. In addition, \n\nhe proposed that a vertical drainage system should be installed close to the upstream face of a \n\ndam, as a means of minimising problems due to uplift pressures. L\u00e9vy\u00b4s suggestions started \n\nan open debate regarding the best way to avoid problems due to seepage. Concerning the dam \n\nfoundation two different ideas arose: some dam engineers were of the opinion that the effects \n\nof uplift pressures could be avoided by intensive grouting, while others argued that it would \n\nbe preferable to install a line of drains to intercept seepage and thus reduce uplift pressures \n\ndownstream from the drainage line. This discussion later led to a consensus that the best \n\noption would be to combine both solutions, and this is the current practice. \n\nIn the 1960s, Arthur Casagrande in the first Rankine Lecture about the control of seepage \n\nthrough foundations and abutments of dams presented an analytical solution, based on Muskat \n\nequation, to determine the value of the uplift pressures beneath a dam with a drainage line, \n\nassuming the opening of a vertical fissure at the heel of the dam. The results of the solution \n\npresented were validated against their comparison with uplift pressures measured in dams \n\nwith drainage systems (Casagrande 1961).  \n\nSerafim and Del Campo (1965) presented a paper with the analytical solution for the \n\ndistribution of uplift pressures at the base of a dam without drainage systems, in which the \n\nimportance of the opening and closing of different discontinuities due to the filling of the \n\nreservoir was highlighted.  \n\nAndrade (1982) presented a solution to determine the hydraulic head in dams with one or \n\nmore drainage lines, assuming vertical fissures at the heel and at the toe of the dam, and \n\nassuming that the dam is impervious and lies on a finite, homogeneous, isotropic and pervious \n\nlayer. The same author later developed a simplified method where the discontinuities through \n\nwhich water flowed were represented by bars (Andrade 1983; 1984; 1988). It was called \n\n\u201cMEPON - Nodal Point Method\u201d and it allowed two and three-dimensional flows to be \n\nsimulated. The medium was assumed to be deformable and the flow to be dependent on the \n\nstate of stress within the foundation. It was a mesh method that required the equilibrium \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nequations to be solved at the nodes, using an iterative procedure. The method was applied to \n\ndetermine the flow rates and the uplift pressures at the base of several concrete dams.  \n\nGoodman et al. (1983) proposed a specific analytical solution for flow through a horizontal \n\ncrack of finite length drained by a series of vertical drains. The solution was used to draw \n\ndimensionless diagrams of uplift pressure on the base of a dam and to demonstrate the \n\ninfluence of drains on the distribution and magnitude of uplift forces. This solution was \n\nobtained when studying a hypothetical situation of a crack developing under the heel of a dam \n\ndue to high overturning moment. Such a crack would have a direct hydraulic connection to \n\nreservoir and water pressure distribution within the crack and would influence the overall dam \n\nstability. \n\nThe integration of Laplace equation can be done by analytical or approximated methods, \n\nusing graphical, experimental or numerical techniques. The use of analytical solutions is \n\nrestricted as the majority of the solutions available correspond to two dimensional flows in \n\nhomogeneous and continuum media, with simple boundary conditions. Graphical techniques \n\nto draw flow nets were widely used (Forchheimer, Leliavsky, among others), but took a lot of \n\ntime and were difficult to apply in domains with complex geometric conditions and various \n\nboundary conditions. Experimental methods, mainly electric analogs, which associate \n\nimportant features of visual methods with the fact that the flow of electricity through \n\nconducting materials is governed by the same differential equations as flow through porous \n\nmedia, were also widely used (Pavlosvsky, Pacher e Yokota, Franciss  (1970), Bear, Louis, \n\namong others).  \n\n2.6.2.2 Hydraulic models \n\nThe finite differences method was one of the first numerical methods to provide approximate \n\nsolutions, and based on this method Serafim (1954) carried out a study with the main \n\nobjective of contributing to a better understanding of the uplift pressures in dams, a subject \n\nunder much debate at the time. He drew attention to the fact that these forces are different \n\nfrom the others acting on dams not only because they depend on the internal structure of the \n\nconcrete and foundations but also because they are influenced by the homogeneity and \n\ncontinuity of their materials. Serafim studied the effect of the water pressure exerted on the \n\ninternal surfaces of the concrete, and computed stresses due to these pressures in gravity \n\ndams, in a horizontal section of the head of a buttress dam and in the arches and cantilevers of \n\nan arch dam. He used the iteration method to solve the Laplace equation and presented the \n\nstudy of the two-dimensional flow in radial sections of arch dams and their foundations. \n\nRegarding the foundation, he evaluated the influence of the foundation permeability and of \n\nboth the grout and drainage systems on the uplift forces. Results of further studies carried out \n\nby the same researcher are presented in Serafim (1968).  \n\n\n\n   40 \n\nWith the occurrence of accidents in large dams, due to seepage in the dam body or in the \n\nfoundation (Teton, Balldwin Hills, Fontenelle, Voughn Creek and Moyie River in the USA, \n\nMalpasset, in France, and Idbar, in the former Yugoslavia), great progress was made from the \n\n1960s onwards in the analysis of foundation problems, together with the development of rock \n\nmechanics. With the development of computers, numerical modelling techniques started to be \n\nwidely used, mainly the FEM, using, when needed, joint elements to simulate discontinuities. \n\nSince then, several two and three dimensional studies on seepage in dam foundations have \n\nbeen presented, which assume anisotropic, discontinuous, and/or fractured media, taking into \n\naccount the influence of the in situ stress conditions and the existence of several seepage \n\ncontrol measures. The study of the mechanical and hydraulic behaviour of discontinuities, \n\nwith data collected in situ and in laboratory, also played an important role in the development \n\nand improvement of some models. Some of these models are briefly presented below. \n\nMascarenhas (1979) used a series of computer programs developed at the National Laboratory \n\nfor Civil Engineering (LNEC) to analyse seepage in the foundation of concrete dams. The \n\nprograms used linear and isoparametric triangular and quadrilateral finite elements and \n\nallowed the simulation of two-dimensional flows in both continuum and discontinuum media \n\nand of axisymmetric flows in continuum media. The programs developed were structured in \n\nsuch a way that they enabled the implementation of three successive calculating phases: i) the \n\ndrawing of the FE mesh and validation of data relative to both geometric and hydraulic \n\ncharacteristics; ii) calculation of the seepage factors, namely the hydraulic head, pressure and \n\nvelocity, and of the mechanical loads due to seepage; and iii) results interpretation. The codes \n\nwere validated by comparing the numerical results with those obtained in various problems in \n\nwhich the solution was known, or with those that had been previously obtained by other \n\nresearchers. Parametric studies were carried out to study the influence of grout and drainage \n\nsystems in the foundation of both gravity and arch dams on the numerical results. The results \n\nof the continuum models were compared with those obtained assuming discontinuum media. \n\nSeepage through the foundation of two operating concrete dams was also analysed. \n\nCarmo Vaz (1979) developed at LNEC a three-dimensional FE program for analysis of \n\nseepage through rock masses in steady-state conditions based on the assumption of continuum \n\nmedium. Two types of isoparametric FE with linear interpolation functions were used: \n\n8-noded FE of the cubic type, and 6-noded prismatic FE with triangular bases. The computer \n\ncode, called PERC, included various sub-programs which were structured in a similar way to \n\nthose mentioned above. The code was validated by comparing the numerical results obtained \n\nin two different problems with analytical solutions: the first was the study of a pumping test in \n\na homogeneous medium confined between two impervious boundaries, and the second the \n\nstudy of the hydrodynamic pressures in a reservoir with moving walls. The code was \n\nafterwards used in the analysis of the observed behaviour of a multiple arch dam foundation \n\n(Mascarenhas et al. 1985; Sousa and Mascarenhas 1984). \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nWittke (1990) presented detailed studies carried out with large three-dimensional FE models \n\nof the dam-foundation system of both gravity and arch dams. He analysed in detail the \n\ninteraction between the dam and the rock mass taking into account the seepage flow within \n\nthe foundation, and presented studies regarding proper boundary conditions and suitable \n\nmodel and mesh sizes both in large models and in detailed analysis. These models have been \n\nused to carry out seepage flow and stability analysis of several operating dams (Wittke and \n\nPolczyk 2002; Wittke et al. 2003). \n\nDa Silva and Da Gama (2003) developed a FE three-dimensional model for seepage analysis \n\nin concrete dam foundations, based on the Darcy\u2019s law to represent flow in the continuous \n\npermeable rock mass and on the Darcy-Weissbach law for pipes to simulate the flow in \n\nsmooth or rough drains, both under laminar or turbulent regime. Two different types of finite \n\nelements were used to simulate flow in the pervious rock mass, internally divided into \n\ntetrahedra. The drain was simulated by one-dimensional finite elements. Non-linear flow in \n\nthe drains was modelled by means of a \u201cvirtual drain\u201d where the Darcy\u2019s law for smooth \n\npipes was applied. The model was validated by comparison of numerical results with the \n\nresults of an analytical solution proposed by Muskat and with the monitoring data of an \n\noperating dam. The model has been used in studies of optimization of the design of drainage \n\nsystems and in studies of the influence of foundation anisotropy on uplift pressures (Da Silva \n\n2005; Da Silva 2006).  \n\n2.6.2.3 Hydromechanical models \n\nThe first FE numerical models for hydromechanical analysis were presented in the early 70s. \n\nThese models analysed either linear hydroelastic phenomena in porous media with fully \n\nimplicit coupling or discrete-fractured media using sequential explicit coupling between the \n\nhydraulic and mechanical analysis (Rutqvist and Stephansson 2003). \n\nThe first method of fully coupled stress-fluid flow analysis in fractured media was presented \n\nby Noorishad et al. (1982). These authors formulated constitutive relationships for the non-\n\nlinear deformable fractures, based on an extension of Biot\u00b4s theory of consolidation (Biot\u2019s \n\nstudies provided the constitutive stress-strain relationships on which the analysis of stress and \n\nfluid flow in deformable porous elastic media is based) and used the flow line element for \n\nmodelling fractures, which saved computer storage and reduced run times when compared to \n\nmodelling with the four-nodal-point element commonly used in FE analysis. The method was \n\ncapable of solving the two-dimensional quasi-static initial-boundary value problem of coupled \n\nstress and fluid flow in saturated deformable fractured porous media. The code was validated \n\nby comparison of numerical results with those obtained with the analytical solution of the \n\nproblem of a single vertical fracture intersecting a well of zero radius. To show the full \n\ncapability of the method the effect of fracture and matrix deformability in the same problem \n\n\n\n   42 \n\nwas examined in detail, and a second problem of an axisymmetric reservoir with a horizontal \n\nfracture at the centre was also investigated. \n\nAsgian (1989) developed a hybrid boundary element-finite difference program for the \n\nmodelling of fluid flow in deformable, jointed rock. The model was used to simulate reservoir \n\nbehaviour with variable joint orientations, injection rates, joint dilation angles and variable \n\nfar-field stress. \n\nMendon\u00e7a (1989) developed a three-dimensional FE model for analysis of the \n\nhydromechanical behaviour of concrete dam foundations. The foundation rock mass was \n\nassumed to be an anisotropic continuum media, with stress-dependent permeability. An \n\niterative technique was used to account for the stress-flow coupling. The code was developed \n\nat LNEC and used the same type of elements as the code PERC, which had been developed \n\n10 years before. The model was used to study the behaviour of Bou\u00e7\u00e3 foundation (Figure \n\n2.11), and the results obtained with coupled and uncoupled models were compared. \n\nNumerical results were also compared with in situ recorded data, obtained before and after \n\nfoundation treatment.  \n\nLamas (1993) developed a FE multilaminate model for hydromechanical analysis of pressure \n\ntunnels and shafts in fractured rock masses. In addition to the joints belonging to the joint \n\nsets, the code allows joint elements to be inserted within a model, so as to simulate main \n\ndiscontinuities, such as faults, or interfaces between different types of material, such as rock \n\nand concrete. The program allows both the hydraulic and mechanical models to run \n\nindependently or in a coupled way. Regarding the hydraulic behaviour, it is possible to model \n\nnon-confined laminar flow, and fluid flow can take place simultaneously in the equivalent \n\ncontinuum and the discontinuum, and also from each of these media into the other. Regarding \n\nthe mechanical behaviour, various failure criteria are included. The non-linear \n\nhydromechanical analysis is conducted in terms of effective stresses, using an iterative \n\nprocedure. The model was used to analyse several general problems and was afterwards \n\napplied to an operating pressure circuit. \n\nWei and Hudson (1998) developed a hybrid discrete-continuum model for water flow in the \n\nnear and far fields of deformable jointed rock masses. In the near field the discontinuum \n\napproach was used, with the discrete element method, and water flowed through \n\ninterconnected fractures only, while in the far field the equivalent continuum model was \n\nemployed, with the boundary integral equation method. Along the interface of the two \n\ndomains, both mechanical and hydraulic compatibility conditions were satisfied. Fully \n\ncoupled hydromechanical analysis could be conducted in the combined near and far fields. \n\nThe effectiveness of the approach was shown by its application to a conceptual dam \n\nfoundation problem.  \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nLeit\u00e3o and Lamas (2006) developed a model of an underground hydroelectric scheme, which \n\nincluded the pressure tunnel, the access tunnels and the underground powerhouse, in order to \n\nstudy the mechanical and hydraulic interaction during the first filling of the pressure tunnel. \n\nAnalysis was carried out with the code FLAC\n3D\n\n, a three-dimensional explicit finite-difference \n\nprogram that uses 8-noded brick elements. The coupled hydromechanical model uses an \n\niterative procedure between two independent hydraulic and mechanical sub-models. \n\nIn more recent years, in addition to the use of the FEM, several studies have been carried out \n\nusing models of flow in discontinuous media (fracture flow models). These models have been \n\napplied mainly for gravity dams, namely using discrete element models, with a view to \n\nevaluating dam stability, taking into account the water pressures resulting from the flow \n\nconditions (e.g. Barla et al. 2004; Gimenes 2000; Gimenes and Fern\u00e1ndez 2006; Lemos 1987; \n\nLemos 1999a; Mostyn et al. 1997). A brief summary of the quoted studies is presented in \n\nchapter 7, in which dam stability assessment is addressed.  \n\nIn the case of arch dams 3D models and multiple joint sets are required and it becomes \n\ndifficult to use fracture flow models. Therefore, the assumption of an equivalent continuum \n\nremains the most widely used tool to study the hydraulic behaviour of dam foundations, \n\ndespite all the investigation carried out regarding flow through discontinuities. Although a \n\nwide variety of models suitable for the analysis of rock masses are available, the complexity \n\nof jointing patterns and the lack of data on hydraulic properties of the discontinuity sets \n\nmakes them difficult to apply in most practical cases. Thus, the use of this type of models in \n\nthe interpretation and operational monitoring of the hydraulic behaviour of dam foundations is \n\nnot common. \n\nTo analyse the hydraulic behaviour of dam foundations it is not only necessary to choose the \n\nmost suitable model to use but also to take into account that the grout curtain and the drainage \n\nsystem have to be properly simulated, so that the chosen model, which must be realistic and \n\ncomputationally efficient, simulates flow accurately. \n\n2.6.3 Numerical codes used in this study \n\nAnalysis presented in this study were carried out with the codes FLAC, UDEC and 3DEC \n\n(Itasca 2003; 2004; 2005). These codes were originally developed for application to \n\ngeotechnical problems, and use explicit step-by-step solution algorithms that obtain static \n\nsolutions by dynamic relaxation. The three codes allow large displacement analysis and \n\ninclude groundwater models, coupled fluid and thermal modes, and dynamic analysis \n\ncapability. They offer various constitutive models, which can be altered by the user, using the \n\nbuilt-in FISH programming language. \n\n\n\n   44 \n\nFLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) is a two-dimensional finite difference \n\nprogram, particularly useful for media that can be modelled as an equivalent continuum with \n\nonly a few discontinuities. FLAC is primarily used for static analysis of soils and rock \n\nmasses. The code uses quadrilateral elements or zones, which are made of two pairs of \n\nsuperimposed constant strain triangles, and simulates the performance of materials that \n\nbehave according to linear or non-linear stress/strain laws in response to the applied forces or \n\nboundary conditions. The material can yield and flow, and the grid formed by the different \n\nzones can deform and move with the material that is represented. The code includes both \n\ninterface elements to simulate planes along which slip and/or separation can occur, and \n\nstructural elements to simulate structural support, which enables its application to a large \n\nnumber of geotechnical problems. Some of the other features are: i) plane-strain, plane-stress \n\nand axisymmetric geometry modes; ii) two-phase flow analysis to simulate the flow of two \n\nimmiscible fluids through a porous medium and iii) determination of the safety factor using \n\nthe strength reduction method. \n\nIn the present study, only the basic groundwater flow model was employed, to analyse steady \n\nstate seepage flows assuming that the fluid obeys the isotropic form of Darcy\u00b4s law. FLAC \n\ntreats steady-flow as an asymptotic case of non-steady-flow. Flow models were run \n\nindependently from mechanical calculations, and only confined flows were simulated. The \n\noption to model axisymmetric geometry, in which cylindrical coordinates are used, was \n\nadopted to simulate seepage flow towards a single drain in an equivalent continuum. Two-\n\ndimensional analysis of seepage through concrete dam foundations in a horizontal plane and \n\nin vertical cross sections of the foundations of both the arch and gravity dams in which in situ \n\ntests were carried out is presented.  \n\nUDEC (Universal Distinct Element Code) is a two-dimensional numerical code that simulates \n\ndiscontinuous media, such as jointed rock masses, subjected to either static or dynamic \n\nloading. It is ideally suited to study potential modes of failure directly related to the presence \n\nof discontinuous features. The medium is represented as an assemblage of discrete blocks and \n\nthe discontinuities as boundary conditions between blocks. UDEC enables the modelling of \n\njointed rock masses in which large displacement and opening of the discontinuities occurs. \n\nIndividual blocks behave as either rigid or deformable material, and in this second case, \n\nblocks are subdivided into a mesh of finite-difference elements. These respond according to a \n\nprescribed linear or non-linear stress-strain law. The relative motion of the discontinuities is \n\nalso governed by linear or non-linear force-displacement relations for movement in both the \n\nnormal and shear directions. This code also allows the simulation of rock reinforcement and \n\nsurface support. \n\nUDEC is able to perform a fully-coupled hydromechanical analysis, where fracture \n\nconductivity is dependent on mechanical deformation and, conversely, joint water pressures \n\n\n\n 45 \n\naffect the mechanical behaviour (Itasca 2004). In this code, it is assumed that rock blocks are \n\nimpervious and that flow takes place only through the set of interconnecting discontinuities. \n\nFlow is modelled by means of the parallel plate model, and the flow rate per unit width is thus \n\nexpressed by the cubic law. Total stresses are obtained inside the impervious blocks and \n\neffective normal stresses at the mechanical contacts.  \n\nIn this study, the fluid flow model in UDEC was used to analyse the steady-state seepage flow \n\nthrough the jointed rock foundation beneath the gravity dam studied. Analysis was carried out \n\nwith a view to evaluating dam stability. A transient analysis was also carried out in order to \n\ndetermine flow times, but was inconclusive because the small timesteps required by UDEC \n\nmake transient fluid flow analysis impractical in relatively large domains and with very small \n\njoint apertures, such as those necessary to analyse flow in dam foundations. \n\nThree-dimensional numerical analysis was carried out with the code 3DEC (Itasca 2003), the \n\nthree-dimensional version of UDEC. 3DEC simulates the media as a group of convex blocks \n\ninternally divided into tetrahedra with linear interpolation functions. The code 3DEC is \n\nparticularly suitable to carry out stability analysis of arch dams, considering some \n\ndiscontinuities in the foundation. \n\nThe main interest of the 3DEC code in dam foundation studies is to analyse failure \n\nmechanisms involving the rock mass discontinuities and the rock/concrete interface (e.g. \n\nLemos 1999a; Resende et al. 2004). In mechanical modelling, the consideration of a few \n\nselected discontinuities is often sufficient to assess the safety conditions. For application to \n\narch dams, special routines are included in 3DEC code (Lemos 1999a) which allow the study \n\nof the dam-foundation system, as the dam can be represented as a shell structure, represented \n\nby the FEM, and the foundation as a group of blocks. In the present study, 3DEC was used \n\nnot only in mechanical analysis but also in seepage analysis, as it is useful to study the \n\nhydraulic behaviour with the same code which is used to carry out stability analysis. \n\n3DEC is capable of modelling water flow through the discontinuities (Damjanac 1996). In \n\nthis study, however, an alternative equivalent continuum model was adopted. This new \n\nversion of the 3DEC code, in addition to fracture flow models, allows the analysis of steady-\n\nstate flows through the blocks using an equivalent continuum model, including flows bounded \n\nabove by a phreatic surface. In the equivalent continuum models it is assumed that the \n\nhydraulic head is the same at points of adjacent blocks with the same position, which means \n\nthat it is assumed that from a hydraulic point of view joints between blocks have no influence \n\non the numerical results. In the hydraulic models presented herein, the division into blocks \n\nhas no physical meaning; it merely makes the mesh design easier. \n\n\n\n   46 \n\nThe choice of 3DEC for equivalent continuum hydraulic models is justified by the fact that \n\nthe water pressure field thus obtained may be transferred to discontinuum mechanical models \n\nfor stability analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 47\n\n3 Collection and evaluation of data on the behaviour of dam \nfoundations \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nObservation is the most reliable means for assessing the safety of the structural system dam-\n\nfoundation-reservoir. This activity begins at the design stage, with the drawing up of the \n\nMonitoring Plan; continues in the construction stage, in which the previously defined \n\ninstruments are installed and the main material properties are characterized; is of vital \n\nimportance during the first filling of the reservoir, which is the structure\u2019s first loading test; \n\nand continues throughout the lifetime of the dam. During construction, the main monitoring \n\nactivities involve installing the instruments, controlling the effect of construction loads (such \n\nas self-weight, thermal loads mainly due to the placement of concrete, injection of contraction \n\njoints and foundation treatment), and characterizing material properties. Once the first filling \n\nof the reservoir has begun, observation is based on the study of different effects (such as \n\ndisplacements, relative movements of joints, drained water, strains and stresses), trying to \n\nestablish the relation between each one of these and variations in the main loads. These main \n\nloads are also monitored, and for concrete dams under normal operating conditions are \n\nhydraulic pressure and variation in ambient (air and reservoir) temperatures. Foundation and \n\ndam structure are usually monitored as a whole, and the design of the foundation monitoring \n\nsystem is just part of the overall system (ICOLD 2005). \n\nMonitoring the main loads and structural effects requires installing equipment to measure \n\ndifferent factors. The equipment and methodologies used to collect and collate the acquired \n\ndata is called the monitoring system. This system includes all the sub-systems installed to \n\nobserve and analyse changes in readings. The factors to be monitored in each dam are defined \n\ntaking into account the dam type and size, specific project features and the risk factors \n\nassociated to dam operation. Monitoring systems should be periodically updated according to \n\nthe stage of the project and foreseen problems. \n\nIn Portugal, the systematic observation of concrete dams began in around 1947, when the \n\nNational Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) was founded, and followed international \n\ntrends in dam observation.  The Monitoring Plans were designed with a threefold aim: i) for \n\nstructural safety control; ii) to interpret dam behaviour; and iii) to verify some design criteria \n\nand improve knowledge on dam behaviour (Rocha 1964). This philosophy in the development \n\nof the Monitoring Plan has been followed since then, which explains the large amount of \n\nequipment installed in the majority of large concrete dams (Pedro 1999b). To detect changes \n\nin dam behaviour at an early stage, the number of factors to be measured is limited and the \n\n\n\n   48 \n\npoints at which readings are taken are carefully chosen. This is called the \u201cquick observation \n\nprogramme\u201d and usually includes the reading of displacements, movement of some joints and \n\nwater pressures underneath the dam. In Portugal there are established rules and \n\nrecommendations regarding the frequency of readings (RSB 2007).  \n\nIt is widely accepted that over the years a great deal of knowledge about dam behaviour has \n\nbeen obtained. On the other hand, the number of people involved in the safety assessment of \n\ndams is not enough to analyse the large quantity of information provided by the monitoring \n\nequipment. Therefore, the current trend in dam observation is to focus only on the really key \n\nmonitoring parameters regarding the safety of each dam (Dunnicliff 1988; Nguyen 2003; \n\nStateler 2006).  \n\nData collection, which is traditionally carried out manually with portable read-out units by on-\n\nsite personnel, is carried out at intervals defined according to the dam type, stage of the \n\nproject, and current or foreseen problems. In addition to the measurements taken by \n\ninstruments installed both in the dam and its foundation, periodic visual inspections in all \n\naccessible zones (crest, upstream and downstream faces, foundation, galleries, appurtenant \n\nworks and reservoir) are essential. In several countries, including Portugal, in addition to the \n\nmanual readings, part of the monitoring data of some large dams is now also collected by \n\nautomated data acquisition systems (ADAS). Remote automated readings have several \n\nadvantages, not least that they enable an almost continuous safety assessment of dams, \n\nproviding the data obtained is appropriately transmitted, validated, stored, and processed \n\n(Farinha et al. 2004). If this is linked to an expert system, warnings can be given when \n\nabnormalities are recorded and corrective measures can even be suggested (Portela 2001). \n\nHowever, it should be noted that even with this kind of control visual inspections at dam-sites \n\nmust be carried out at certain intervals. \n\nThe evaluation of dam behaviour, particularly the foundation, and its safety assessment are \n\ngreatly improved if the monitoring data is compared with predicted values by means of \n\nmodels, which conceptually simulate dam behaviour. These can be either numerical or \n\nstatistical models. The first require realistic input parameters and the second a large number of \n\nmonitoring results and substantial experience to support their application to a particular type \n\nof structure (Lemos 1999b).  \n\nThis chapter briefly presents the basis, the methods and the equipment for foundation \n\nmonitoring, and the methodologies currently used in the analysis of concrete dam foundation \n\nmonitoring data. Using the traditional simplified methods of quantitative interpretation, a \n\nprocedure is proposed for the analysis of the recorded discharges, which takes into account \n\nthe non-linear hydromechanical behaviour of dam foundations. \n\n\n\n 49 \n\n3.2 Safety control criteria \n\nThe safety of a large dam must be ensured during the structure\u2019s complete lifetime and \n\ntherefore a series of measures are usually taken, beginning at the design stage, to fulfil both \n\nsafety and serviceability requirements. Regarding the dam foundation there are three main \n\nscenarios of rock mass foundation deterioration to be concerned with (Pedro et al. 1989):  \n\ni) cracking and movements within the rock mass associated with joint systems and \n\nfaults,  \n\nii) absolute displacements of the rock mass surface and relative displacements of adjacent \n\nblocks of the dam which may affect the grout curtain or other watertight systems or \n\nthe operating conditions of the equipment, and  \n\niii) seepage through the foundation and abutments, because this can lead to high uplift \n\npressures, which destabilize the dam, or to potential high seepage velocities, which \n\ncause erosion. \n\nAt the design stage, estimates of the hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of the dam \n\nfoundation are obtained using adequate models and taking into account different scenarios \n\nwhich may occur. The hydromechanical behaviour of a rock mass on which a concrete dam is \n\ngoing to be built is always difficult to know until the first filling of the reservoir, despite all \n\nthe investigation carried out at previous stages. It is therefore very difficult to establish rules \n\nto be followed by the designer. However, based on both design criteria and experience, there \n\nare established principals and general criteria that should be followed by the designer with a \n\nview to guaranteeing the dam safety. \n\nParticularly relevant is the distribution of water pressures along the base of the dam or along \n\npotential sliding surfaces in the foundation. At the design stage, full reservoir head can be \n\nassumed at the heel of the dam and zero or tailwater head, if any, at the toe of the dam. It is \n\nusually assumed that at the drainage line the head is equal to between one half and one third \n\nof the head difference between the heel and toe of the dam. Thus, a bi-linear distribution of \n\nthe uplift pressure along the base of the dam is assumed. It is normal practice to use the value \n\nof one third of the head difference between the head and toe of the dam as this was \n\nestablished from data obtained in piezometric readings taken in the foundations of a number \n\nof both Tennessee Valley Authority and US Bureau of Reclamation dams (Casagrande 1961). \n\nA more conservative assumption, for an inoperative drainage system, is a linear distribution, \n\ni.e. a constant decrease in head between the heel and toe of the dam. The head distribution \n\nalong the base of the dam depends mainly on the presence and efficiency of the drainage \n\nsystem. Several studies have been carried out by different bodies (\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France \n\n(EDF), Swiss Committee on Dams (SCD) and Electric Power and Research Institute (EPRI), \n\n\n\n   50 \n\nin the USA) regarding analysis of recorded uplift data. All of these studies, which are briefly \n\npresented along with the main results in European Club of ICOLD (2004a), were carried out \n\nbecause of the general acknowledgement that design assumptions have never been fully \n\nvalidated. Different criteria have been adopted by different bodies regarding the distribution \n\nof uplift pressures along the base of the dam, and great effort has been made in order to \n\nanalyse the differences in the results (European Club of ICOLD 2004a; USACE 2000). \n\nAccording to the current Portuguese guidelines for dam design (RSB 2007) the dam safety \n\nshould be assessed analysing its behaviour for normal operating and failure scenarios. For \n\nnormal operating conditions it is required that the displacements and stresses in the rock mass \n\nclose to the surface be relatively small, that the drained water through the foundation be such \n\nthat it corresponds to an average permeability at the grout curtain area not higher than 1 LU, \n\nand that the uplift at the drainage line be lower than the equivalent of 1/3 of the hydraulic \n\nhead upstream from the dam. For failure scenarios it is recommended that equilibrium exists \n\nin wedges defined by joints and faults for which movement is possible, that out-of-control \n\nflow of water through the foundation with high seepage velocity is not likely to occur, and \n\nthat the drained water through the foundation is such that it corresponds to an average \n\npermeability at the grout curtain area not higher than 5 LU. \n\nTwo of the above-mentioned requirements merit further comment: the first concerns the \n\ndesired level of permeability and the second the uplift at the drainage line. Regarding the first, \n\nit is worth noting that the attempt to construct a grout curtain with a final water injection rate \n\nof 1 LU is considered inappropriate, as this can only be achieved by intensive and often costly \n\ngrouting schemes and is only necessary in the special cases where the reservoir water is very \n\nprecious or soluble rock is present in the foundation (ICOLD 2005). Regarding the second, \n\nthe requirement that the uplift at the drainage line be lower than the equivalent of 1/3 of the \n\nhydraulic head upstream from the dam disregards the head of the toe of the dam, which may \n\nbe significant, in particular in dams with a reservoir downstream. In this case, and at the \n\ndesign stage, it would be better to require that the pressure at the drainage line be lower than \n\nthe equivalent of the tailwater head plus 1/3 of the difference between reservoir and tailwater \n\nheads. \n\nAt the construction and operation stages, the foundation treatment and proper maintenance of \n\nthe drainage system are essential to ensure the safety of the dam. Regarding stability, water \n\npressures are the most crucial aspect, but discharge is also a relevant factor as it is correlated \n\nwith seepage velocity, which should be limited in order to avoid erosion of material in open \n\njoints.  \n\nFor the evaluation of both grout curtain and drainage efficiency, Mascarenhas and Silva \n\n(1990) proposed a methodology which takes into account recorded discharges and water \n\n\n\n 51 \n\npressures. They mention that the three main aims of grout and drainage systems are: i) to \n\nreduce uplift pressures to values close to those foreseen in the design; ii) to restrict seepage \n\nvelocity so as to keep erosion of material in discontinuities to a minimum, and iii) to restrict \n\nseepage through the foundation, taking into account functional and economic factors. To \n\nachieve these aims the following criteria are established at the design stage: i) the maximum \n\nhydraulic head allowed along the drainage line (?max), expressed in percentage of hydraulic \n\nhead (percentage of hydraulic head is the ratio of the water head measured at a given level, \n\nexpressed in metres of height of water, to the height of water in the reservoir above that level, \n\nas mentioned in the previous chapter, section 2.5.3); ii) the maximum allowable discharge per \n\nmetre (qmax); and iii) the maximum global discharge (Qmax). If there is more than one drainage \n\nline, these criteria should be established for each of them.  \n\nThey suggest that a global index IG (IP; Iq; IQ) should be used in which: \n\nmax\n\n0\n\nmax\n\nmax0\n\nmax\n\nmax0\n\nQ\n\nQ\nI\n\nq\n\nq\nII\n\nQqP\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n \n\n(3.1) \n\nwhere ?0 max is the maximum percentage of hydraulic head recorded along the drainage line, \n\nq0 max  is the maximum recorded discharge per metre along the drainage line and Q0 the total \n\nrecorded discharge. The three different sub-indexes, IP, Iq and IQ, are called pressure index, \n\nunitary discharge index and global discharge index, respectively. Different foundation areas \n\ncan be analysed using these indexes. Mascarenhas and Silva stress the fact that the global \n\nindex can only be used if the dam is adequately monitored, if there is confidence in the \n\nmonitoring data and if detailed knowledge of the seepage pattern has already been obtained. \n\nThe global index IG shows the actual effectiveness of both the grout and the drainage systems, \n\nand in the case of an efficient system each of the three sub-indexes IP, Iq and IQ should be less \n\nthan or equal to 1. This methodology was used to analyse the efficiency of additional \n\nfoundation treatment which had to be carried out in some Portuguese dams, due to excessive \n\nrecorded discharges or water pressures (Fronhas arch dam, Venda Nova arch-gravity dam and \n\nVarosa arch dam), and in every case it was concluded that IG was significantly lower after \n\ntreatment (Mascarenhas 1991; Mascarenhas and Silva 1990). It was also used to assess where \n\nadditional foundation treatment should be carried out in Funcho arch dam (LNEC 1998b), and \n\nto assess the efficiency of the grout and drainage systems of the different structures of Alto \n\nRabag\u00e3o dam. This dam has an arch structure in the main valley and two gravity structures, \n\none on each side.  \n\nWhile the method is very simple and can be effective, the global index does, however, have \n\nthree main drawbacks. Firstly, it takes both the maximum hydraulic head and discharges \n\nprescribed in the design as reference. However, despite all the investigation carried out prior \n\n\n\n   52 \n\nto dam construction, it is impossible to predict the hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation \n\nin normal operating conditions, and therefore the values established at the design stage should \n\nnot be considered as \u201creference\u201d. Secondly, it does not take into account the length of both \n\ndrainage and piezometric boreholes, nor the depth at which the main seepage paths cross the \n\nboreholes. Finally, a high water pressure recorded in a piezometer may be localised and high \n\nwater pressures are only relevant when acting on a horizontal discontinuity with a large \n\nsurface, which encompasses the whole base of a dam block. It is worth noting that low water \n\npressures recorded in a piezometer can be misleading in some cases, as is going to be shown \n\nin chapter 6.8. \n\n3.3 Foundation monitoring \n\nThe first use of instruments in rock foundations of concrete dams was mainly for research \n\npurposes (Londe 1993). In fact, after the 2nd World War, with the construction of an \n\nincreasing number of large dams, the amount of monitoring equipment to control structural \n\nbehaviour increased significantly but most of the equipment was placed in the superstructure \n\nto confirm design hypotheses, and not in the foundation, as rock mass foundation \n\ncharacteristics were not taken into account until the sixties, when it was understood that \n\nserious accidents had occurred due to defective foundations.  \n\nThe mechanical and hydraulic behaviour of rock mass foundations is currently monitored \n\nwith a group of techniques and equipment which allow the measurement of displacements and \n\nstrains, uplift pressures, discharges, stresses, and physical and chemical properties of the \n\nwater. Instruments are systematically installed for the follow-up of the actual behaviour \n\nduring construction, the first filling of the reservoir and in the longer term. \n\nRegarding the equipment, it is necessary to measure both external loads and responses. The \n\nfirst type includes hydrostatic pressure, meteorological quantities, and seismic events; and the \n\nsecond, which indicate the behaviour of the dam foundation, includes mainly deformations, \n\nwater pressures, and discharges. Measurable quantities and the different monitoring devices \n\nwhich may be installed are listed and briefly described in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2. \n\nAdditional equipment is often installed in order to evaluate materials\u2019 properties. \n\nDisplacements are measured using geodetic methods or along lines and the different readings \n\ntogether, some of which are redundant, create a three-dimensional or spatial displacement \n\nmeasuring system. Regarding water pressures, it has to be taken into account that piezometric \n\nreadings provide much localised information and can vary greatly from point to point, as they \n\ndepend on the flow paths of water within the rock mass. Piezometers may be installed \n\nupstream and downstream from the drainage system, in order to measure the hydraulic head \n\ndifference and therefore evaluate the efficiency of the seepage control measures. In Portugal, \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nthe majority of the piezometers installed in the foundations of concrete dams have a long \n\nsingle chamber and therefore give only one water pressure value, which is the result of the \n\ninflow and outflow of water from different strata or discontinuities which have different \n\nhydraulic heads. This type of piezometers, which are accessible to water over their whole \n\nlength, although  not  recommended by the ICOLD (2005), remain widely used due to the fact  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Monitoring deformations in concrete dam rock foundations (after ICOLD 2005). \n\n\n\n   54 \n\nthat multilevel piezometers, which allow measurement of water pressures in isolated sections \n\nof the holes, require demanding care in their design and installation. Only a few attempts have \n\nbeen made in Portugal to install multilevel piezometers, which are described in detail in \n\nchapter 6, section 6.8.1. Devices like the continuous borehole piezometer (Londe 1973c), the \n\npiezofor (Bordes and Debeuille 1987) and the piezodex (Kovari and K\u00f6ppel 1987), which do \n\nnot disturb the seepage pattern and allow the complete piezometric profile along a borehole to \n\nbe logged, were mainly used for research activities.  \n\nPart of the water flowing through the foundation is collected by the drainage boreholes, and it \n\nis recommended that partial discharges be monitored in addition to the total discharge as this \n\nprocedure enables the identification of critical areas, if there is a sudden or gradual but \n\nconsistent change in seepage rates. Physical and chemical analysis of both the reservoir and \n\ndrained water are carried out in order to detect the occurrence of erosion or dissolution of \n\nmaterials either from the rock mass or the grout curtain.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Monitoring seepage flow and water pressures in concrete dam rock foundations \n\n(after ICOLD 2005). \n\n(0.05 litre/s =3 l/min) \n\n(10 litres/s =600 l/min) \n\n\n\n 55 \n\n3.4 Methodologies used in the collecting and evaluation of the monitoring \n\ndata \n\n3.4.1 Collecting and collating of the monitoring data \n\nThe Monitoring Plan establishes the frequency of readings which are usually carried out by \n\nexpert teams on dam observation. In a first phase, readings are compared with maximum and \n\nminimum limits established either by the equipment\u2019s measuring range or by previous \n\nreadings. This allows measurements to be readily repeated and re-checked if there are major \n\nchanges between subsequent readings, possibly using alternate readout equipment. Data \n\ncollected should be checked a second time, as soon as it is entered into a computer system, by \n\ncomparison with performance limits established case by case taking into account previously \n\nobserved and predicted dam behaviour. \n\nThe amount of data concerning each dam is very large and therefore several automatic \n\nsystems have been developed worldwide for its management and analysis (e.g. Cadei et al. \n\n1990; Gallego et al. 2007; Huai-Zhi and Zhi-Ping 2005). In Portugal, an automatic system \n\ncalled GestBarragens has recently been developed with the aim of supporting the activities \n\nconcerned with safety control in its various stages (Pina and Portela 2006; Portela et al. 2005). \n\nIt results from a close partnership between three Portuguese bodies (LNEC; Instituto de \n\nEngenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenvolvimento (INESC-ID); and \n\nElectricidade de Portugal (EDP)) and aims at obtaining, automatically, a diagnosis of the \n\ndam\u00b4s actual performance from analysis of all the information available, particularly that from \n\nthe monitoring system, with a view to detecting possible changes of safety or functionality \n\nconditions. It is hoped that in the future GestBarragens will be linked to an expert system. \n\n3.4.2 Evaluation of the monitoring data \n\nThe behaviour of a dam is only properly understood through the careful interpretation of the \n\nreadings from the most relevant instruments. Analysis of readings over time allows the \n\nassessment of the dam behaviour, which is not only the best indication of how the dam is \n\ngoing to behave in the future but also provides a means to detect the occurrence of sudden or \n\ngradual changes in dam behaviour, which may require further attention. The current practice \n\nin studies of the behaviour of concrete dam foundations is: \n\ni) to analyse the monitoring data taking into account the variations over time of \n\ndifferent measurements (such as total and partial discharges, uplift and \n\ncorresponding percentage of hydraulic head, and displacements measured in \n\ninverted plumb lines and in foundation extensometers); \n\n\n\n   56 \n\nii) to compare measurements taken on different dates in which the main loads have \n\nsimilar values, and  \n\niii) to analyse the correlation between discharges and water level in the reservoir. \n\nWhenever possible, analysis is carried out in order to correlate readings taken in different \n\ninstruments. This is the case of discharges and water pressures which are usually analysed \n\ntogether, as their simultaneous analysis provides an indication of the efficiency of both grout \n\nand drainage systems. Only in a few cases is the monitoring data compared with the results of \n\nnumerical or physical models of the dam-foundation system.  \n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned analyses, it is also usual to perform statistical studies of \n\nquantitative interpretation of the recorded displacements. In fact, due to their simplicity, these \n\nmethods have been extensively used in interpretation of dam behaviour. The next section \n\npresents a brief description of these methods and the studies carried out in order to analyse \n\nrecorded discharges using quantitative interpretation are afterwards presented.   \n\n3.4.3 Quantitative interpretation methods \n\nThe main loads to take into account in the analysis of concrete dam monitoring results during \n\nnormal operation are variations in the reservoir level and variations in ambient temperature. \n\nAs these loads act simultaneously, the most representative structural behaviour effects \n\nmeasured on each date, namely displacements, strains and stresses, are the result of this \n\ncoupled action. Therefore, to analyse and interpret concrete dam behaviour it is essential to \n\nseparate and identify each one of the loads contribution to the observed effects. This \n\nseparation can be easily done when the variation of one of the main loads is predominant, \n\nbetween two dates sufficiently close so that the effects due to variations of material\u2019s \n\nproperties over time or due to ageing process are negligible. In a systematic way, this \n\nseparation can be done using effect separation methods, also named quantitative interpretation \n\nmethods which, from the simultaneous consideration of a large number of monitoring results, \n\ntry to establish a correlation between a given observed structural effect and the variations in \n\neach of the main loads.  \n\nThe first studies on dam behaviour using quantitative interpretation methods were published \n\nfrom 1955 to 1960, most of them in the 6\nth\n\n ICOLD Congress (Ferry and Willm 1958; Rocha \n\n1956; Rocha et al. 1958a; Rocha et al. 1960; Rocha et al. 1958b; Service Construction \n\nAm\u00e9nagements Hydro\u00e9lectriques du Groupe Edison-Milan 1958; Tremmel 1958; Xerez and \n\nLamas 1958). Most of these studies analysed displacements recorded in concrete dams, and \n\ntried to identify the elastic parts of the displacement due both to hydrostatic pressure and to \n\nvariations in temperature linked to the annual thermal wave. The part of the displacement \n\nwhich could not be explained by the above-mentioned elastic parts was the \u201ctime effect\u201d. A \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nnew procedure was later presented by the Italians, in which the correlations between the main \n\nloads and the structural effects took into account the results of structural models (Bonaldi et \n\nal. 1977; 1980a; 1980b; 1982; Fanelli 1979; Fanelli et al. 1979). Doboz (1982) and Ramos \n\n(1985) found a way to separate the part that could be explained by the non-elastic behaviour \n\nof the dam concrete from the time effect. Currently, work is focused on the development of \n\nmodels which include thermal corrections to the so called HST models (hydrostatic, seasonal, \n\ntime models in which it is assumed that the seasonal thermal effects are properly modelled by \n\na cyclical annual wave) by taking into account recorded temperatures. The need for these new \n\nmodels is based on the observation that the HST model is not entirely suitable when there are \n\ncyclic water level variations in phase with the seasonal thermal variations, and on the fact that \n\nthe climate is changing and therefore dams are now subjected to unusual temperature \n\nconditions (L\u00e9ger and Leclerc 2007; Penot et al. 2005). \n\nQuantitative interpretation methods have been widely applied and are the subject of numerous \n\nstudies (e.g. Bonelli 2004; Breitenstein et al. 1985; Carr\u00e8re et al. 2000; Cr\u00e9pon and Lino \n\n1999; De Sortis and Paoliani 2007; Florentino et al. 1971; Florentino et al. 1985; Gicot 1964; \n\n1976; Gomes 1981; Gomes and Matos 1985; Guedes and Coelho 1985; Hasegawa and \n\nMurakami 1988; Jinping and Zhenzhao 1988; LNEC 1961; Miike and Kobayashi 1989; Pedro \n\net al. 1984; Perner et al. 2001; SCD 2003; Serafim et al. 1962; Silveira 1965; Silveira and \n\nPedro 1964; Silveira et al. 1981; Widmann 1967; Willm and Beaujoint 1967) and, although \n\ndifferent assumptions and techniques have been used, the simplicity of the method and the \n\naccuracy of the results reported over time have shown that these methods are a powerful tool \n\nin the analysis of concrete dam behaviour. \n\nThese methods have been classified according to the materials\u00b4 rheologic behaviour, mainly \n\nas elastic and visco-elastic, or according to the structural numerical models on which they \n\nrely, as statistical, deterministic, and mixed. In statistical models the main loads\u2019 effects are \n\nrepresented by means of functions that are completely independent from one point to another. \n\nThese methods are purely empirical, therefore requiring chronological series of readings of \n\nthe different variables over a sufficiently long period of time. The series of cause and effect \n\nquantities are then correlated by means of regression techniques. In deterministic models the \n\nmain loads\u2019 effects are represented by functions obtained from the results of numerical \n\nmodels, so they are not totally independent from one point to another. Mixed methods \n\ncombine the fundamental features of the statistical and deterministic methods, for instance \n\nmaking use of a statistical formulation relative to one of the main loads and a deterministic \n\nformulation relative to the other. Detailed description of quantitative interpretation methods \n\nand of the above-mentioned models can be found in Gomes (1981), Castro (1997) and SCD \n\n(2003)  and therefore only the basic formulation of the statistical elastic method is presented \n\nhere. \n\n\n\n   58 \n\nQuantitative interpretation studies are carried out during periods when there are no events that \n\nmay lead to significant structural changes, such as earthquakes or rehabilitation of the \n\nfoundation or of the dam body. In terms of both concrete and foundation behaviour, of which \n\nthe properties change over time, this requires the use of mean values of the parameters \n\nrelative to their behaviour. When an elastic structural behaviour is expected, it is assumed that \n\n(Gomes 1981): \n\ni) the most representative factors of the structural behaviour, in normal operating \n\nconditions, can be separated into two parts, one elastic (reversible and \n\ninstantaneous) mainly due to variations in hydrostatic pressure and temperature, \n\nand another non-elastic (irreversible), which is exclusively a function of time; \n\nii) the effects due to variations in hydraulic pressures and temperature can be studied \n\nseparately.  \n\nIn the first hypothesis, time effects are considered to be independent of changes in the main \n\nloads, and therefore the analysis of dam behaviour can first be carried out examining the time \n\neffects. In many dams this is a simplification, for example in the case of concrete creep in \n\nwhich a significant part of the time effects depends both on changes in reservoir level and on \n\nconcrete properties. The second hypothesis is based on the assumption that materials have an \n\nelastic behaviour, which is confirmed for the level of stresses that occur in concrete dams in \n\nnormal operating conditions. \n\nIn elastic methods, the different effects associated to an observation date i, on a given point, \n\nare related by means of a function of the type: \n\n? ? ? ?????\n??????\n\ni j k\n\nkkjjii\n\niitiihiiii\n\nrktpcgbhfa\n\nrktUUhUthU\n\n)()()(\n\n)()()(),,(\n\n?\n\n?? ?\n\n \n\n(3.2) \n\nwhere Ui (hi,?i,ti) is a given observed effect observed on date i, which depends on the \n\nhydrostatic pressure, the temperature and the moment when the data is collected, and Uh(h), \n\nU?(?) and Ut(t) represent, respectively, the parts due to the elastic effect of variations in \n\nreservoir water level, due to the elastic effect associated with thermal variations and due to the \n\ntime effect with the starting point at the beginning of the period under analysis. Each one of \n\nthese parts can be approximated by pre-established sums of level, temperature and time \n\nfunctions, fi, gj, and pk, and depend on the coefficients ai, bj and ck, which need to be \n\ncalculated. Separation of effects requires the consideration of the constant k due to the fact \n\nthat on the observation reference date the calculated value is not zero. The residue ri \n\nrepresents the deviation between the value observed on date i and the result of the quantitative \n\n\n\n 59 \n\ninterpretation model. Thus ri represents observation errors and errors due to model\u2019s \n\nunsuitability. \n\nCoefficients ai, bj and ck are determined through the calculation of a system of n equations, in \n\nwhich n is the number of selected observations. The system of equations can be solved by the \n\nGauss criterion which establishes the parameters that minimize the sum of the squares of the \n\nerrors ri (least square method). In a quantitative analysis a reference date has to be given in \n\norder to calculate the time effect. This date must be prior to the first date considered in the \n\nanalysis, but the curves obtained are the same regardless of the given date, as the result is \n\nadjusted with the independent term (k). \n\nQuantitative interpretation methods can be used in the analysis of concrete dam measurement \n\ndata with the following purposes (Florentino 1983):  \n\ni) automated control of future dam behaviour;  \n\nii) validation of numerical structural models; and  \n\niii) analysis of evolution in dam behaviour.  \n\nRegarding the first above-mentioned purpose, as the results of quantitative interpretation of \n\nmonitoring data define a structural behaviour model of the dam, the safety assessment of the \n\ndam can be made automatically by comparing the observed values on a specific date with the \n\npredicted values obtained from the quantitative interpretation of previously measured data.  \n\nConcerning the second, to validate numerical models, influence lines due to the water \n\npressure and due to thermal loads, determined from the quantitative interpretation of \n\nmonitoring data and from the numerical model, are compared. The quantitative interpretation \n\ncovers a range of levels in the reservoir, which should be uniformly distributed. The \n\ncomparison between influence lines due to the water pressure calculated with the quantitative \n\ninterpretation and with the numerical model, for the same range of levels in the reservoir, \n\nallows the correction of the numerical parameters, which makes the use of the numerical \n\nmodel in the prediction of the dam behaviour possible. Finally, as regards development in \n\ndam behaviour, analysis can first be carried out examining the time effect, which is \n\nasymptotic and in most cases can be explained by the concrete rheologic behaviour or by \n\nageing processes. However, in this analysis it must be taken into account that the non-elastic \n\neffects that may exist can be statistically divided between the different parts negatively \n\naffecting the quality of the interpretation.  \n\nQuantitative interpretation methods are typically used in the analysis of displacements of \n\nconcrete dams. Displacements reflect a structural global behaviour and are influenced both by \n\nvariations in reservoir level, which can be established using quantitative interpretation \n\n\n\n   60 \n\nmethods and compared with the results of a numerical model, and also by variations in \n\nambient temperature. The time effect is in most cases mainly a concrete creep effect which \n\ncan be analysed and characterised from the results of tests carried out in creep cells, either in \n\nsitu or in laboratory, or can also be an ageing process, such as swelling. Although not often \n\napplied in practice, statistical modelling can also be used to analyse strains and stresses. On \n\nthis subject, Oliveira (2000) presented a new formulation to interpret recorded strains with a \n\nview to converting them into histories of stresses, which was later implemented by Moura \n\n(2005). In observed factors which do not correspond to linear structural responses, such as \n\njoint movements, piezometric levels, uplift and discharges, the use of quantitative \n\ninterpretation methods is not current, as in these cases the principle of superposition of effects \n\nis not valid. \n\nFoundation monitoring results include foundation movement, water pressures and seepage. \n\nThe use of statistical models of quantitative interpretation to study the behaviour of the \n\nfoundation, taking into account the monitoring data, has almost been limited to the analysis of \n\ndisplacements recorded with plumb lines and foundation extensometers. The foundation \n\nmovement close to a dam is treated in a similar manner to dam body movement, which means \n\nthat the same influence functions and governing variables considered in the prediction of the \n\ndam body displacements are generally used (SCD 2003). It is not easy to use these methods to \n\nstudy the hydromechanical behaviour of dam foundations as this behaviour is non linear, due \n\nto the influence of stress on permeability and to the possible time gap between the variation in \n\nthe main loads and the variation in the measurement data. This raises doubts regarding the \n\napplication of the principle of superposition of effects. \n\n3.5 Quantitative interpretation of recorded discharges \n\n3.5.1 Previous studies \n\nThe difficulties regarding the quantitative interpretation of discharges and water pressures \n\nwere highlighted by Fanelli (1979) who came to the conclusion that the interpretation of \n\nseepage and uplift using deterministic models was not always satisfactory because the elastic \n\nscheme very often did not work for the foundation rock mass. This was all the more evident \n\nwhen the mechanical properties of the rock were weak. He therefore thought that statistical \n\nmodels should be used after being adjusted to the peculiarity of foundation behaviour. He \n\nhighlighted that equipment installed within the foundation rock mass often showed long time \n\nlags and hystereses in relation to variations in external factors (such as variations in reservoir \n\nlevel) and therefore a simple correlation between synchronous values of causes and effects \n\nwould generally be inadequate. Memory effects would have to be introduced. Fanelli thought \n\nthat much development and research work was still necessary in this field. Since this \n\nstatement, only a few attempts have been made using statistical modelling in the analysis of \n\n\n\n 61 \n\npiezometric levels and seepage discharges recorded in concrete dam foundations. Some of \n\nthese studies are briefly referred to in the following paragraphs. \n\nBreitenstein et al. (1985) analysed discharges recorded in five large concrete dams of the \n\nsame hydro-electric development using a method of quantitative interpretation in which not \n\nonly the reservoir level and ambient temperature measured on each date are taken into \n\naccount but also their variation in the preceding weeks. \n\nDrain discharges and water pressures recorded in the foundation of Cabril arch dam were \n\nanalysed using a procedure in which the influence line of the hydrostatic pressure obtained \n\nwith a quantitative interpretation was adjusted taking into account results from a numerical \n\nmodel. The same procedure was used in the analysis of discharges and water pressures \n\nrecorded in the foundation of Venda Nova arch-gravity dam (Gomes and Matos 1985). \n\nFigure 3.3 shows that the numerical results obtained in both cases are very close to the \n\nrecorded data. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Results of quantitative interpretation of discharges in drains located in a) Cabril \n\ndam and b) Venda Nova dam, and comparison with recorded discharges (adapted from \n\nGomes and Matos 1985). \n\n\n\n   62 \n\nGuedes and Coelho (1985) predicted the piezometric pressure recorded in a piezometer \n\ninstalled in the Funil dam and the seepage discharge close to the Itaipu dam spillway, both in \n\nBrazil, using simple methods with only a water height and time. However, to take into \n\naccount a time lag between the variation in water levels and variations in water pressures and \n\ndischarges, the water level prevailing 15 days before the date of the prediction was used in \n\npressure analysis and the average water level from days 6 to 11 prior to the day of the \n\nmeasurement was used in analysis of discharges. Results of the quantitative interpretation of \n\ndischarges are shown in Figure 3.4. \n\nSilva (1988) made quantitative interpretations of discharges recorded in the foundation of \n\nCahora Bassa arch dam, in Mozambique, in which the effect of the hydrostatic pressure was \n\nrepresented by a polynomial curve. This was obtained taking into account the curve which \n\nrepresented the variation in the total discharge due to the variation of the reservoir level \n\nduring a period in which the latter had increased significantly. Piezometric readings were \n\nanalysed using the same procedure. \n\nLombardi et al. (2008) applied an algorithm developed to analyse the functional delays \n\nobserved in the behaviour of concrete dams, especially those related with the thermal field, in \n\nthe analysis of discharges recorded in the foundation of an arch dam. A delay of about six \n\ndays was used for the part of the discharges caused by variations in water level, obtained by \n\nan optimisation process. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Comparison of the discharges recorded close to the Itaipu dam spillway with the \n\nresults of a quantitative interpretation (adapted from Guedes and Coelho 1985). \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nMore generally, it is accepted that water pressures depend on the foundation deformations. \n\nThey are thus, theoretically, influenced by the same variables: reservoir level, concrete \n\ntemperature and time. Whenever seepage discharge is influenced by precipitation, it is \n\nappropriate to include this as a variable (SCD 2003). \n\n3.5.2 This study \n\nAn attempt was made to analyse recorded discharges using methods of quantitative \n\ninterpretation, taking into account the non-linear rock mass hydromechanical behaviour. As \n\nwith displacements and stresses, it was decided that the main loads to take into account in the \n\nanalysis of discharges during normal operation are variations in the reservoir level and \n\nvariations in ambient temperature (variations in ambient temperature cause changes in the \n\nstructure\u2019s temperature, which may give rise to dam displacements that affect the dam \n\nfoundation deformation, and thus the aperture of the discontinuities through which water \n\nflows). The time effect, which when analysing dam displacements can often be explained by \n\nthe rheologic behaviour of dam concrete or by a swelling process is, in the case of discharges, \n\ndue to unpredictable effects. These can be changes in seepage paths caused by clearing, \n\nerosion or dissolution (as in the case of Venda Nova dam mentioned in the previous chapter), \n\nor more commonly, clogging of both seepage paths and drainage boreholes, and can not be \n\ncorrelated with variations in the main loads nor be represented by any curve or law. The \n\ncyclic variations in both the water level in the reservoir, due to the dam operating regime, and \n\nin annual temperature, add complexity to the dam foundation behaviour as they also \n\ncontribute to changes in seepage paths. \n\nClogging of seepage paths over time is a commonly observed phenomenon in concrete dam \n\nfoundations. In fact, during dam operation very fine materials settle on the reservoir bottom. \n\nThis fine sediment flows through the foundation discontinuities and when it arrives close to \n\nthe grout curtain it settles, causing a natural blockage of the discontinuities with very small \n\napertures, which were impossible to fill with cement grout. This phenomenon occurs from the \n\ngrout curtain towards upstream and is favourable to the dam, as it improves the grouting \n\neffect and reduces the quantity of water flowing through the foundation. This natural blockage \n\nis enhanced when the discharges are low, with low seepage velocities. However, clogging of \n\nthe drainage system can be a problem, especially if this leads to an increase in water \n\npressures. \n\nIn this chapter, the shape of the influence line of the hydrostatic pressure on discharges in a \n\nconcrete dam foundation is presented. Using polynomial functions whose graph adequately \n\nfollows the shape of the above-mentioned line, a series of quantitative interpretation analysis \n\nwas carried out, taking into account the thermal and time effects in addition to the effect of \n\n\n\n   64 \n\nhydrostatic pressure. Discharges recorded in both single drains and seepage measuring weirs \n\nof two large Portuguese dams were analysed.  \n\nA program for quantitative interpretation was purposely developed for this study, with the \n\nprogramming language Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that can be used within \n\nMicrosoft Excel. The program was developed in order to analyse all the scalar quantities \n\nusually recorded in dam surveillance. Several different functions were considered in order to \n\nrepresent the effect of the hydrostatic load, and of the thermal and time effects. The functions \n\nto use in each analysis can be easily and quickly chosen. Program validation was carried out \n\nwith a comprehensive comparison of results with those of other available codes. The program \n\nwas developed in such a way that the use of any new functions found useful whilst developing \n\nthe study could be easily introduced into the code. \n\n3.5.3 Variations in discharges due to variations in the reservoir level \n\nDue to the hydromechanical behaviour of rock masses, the permeability depends on the state \n\nof stress and strain within the foundation and, consequently, discharges vary with these \n\nchanges in rock mass permeability. The permeability of the rock mass in the upstream area, \n\nclose to and underneath the heel of the dam, is often greater than that at the downstream area, \n\nwhich causes variations in permeability along seepage paths. In order to be able to separate \n\nthe effect of the hydrostatic pressure on discharges, the shape of the non-linear curve which \n\nrepresents the relation between the water height in the reservoir and the quantity of water \n\ncollected in a concrete dam drainage system was established using a two-dimensional \n\ndiscontinuous model of a dam foundation, in which the normal stiffness of the foundation \n\ndiscontinuities was varied so as to assume rock mass foundations with different deformability. \n\nThis model and the numerical simulations carried out are described in detail in chapter 7. \n\nFigure 3.5 shows the model of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o gravity dam used in this analysis. Due to lack of data \n\na much idealised fracture pattern was assumed. \n\nThree different rock mass foundations were considered, with the same geometry but with \n\ndiscontinuities\u2019 normal stiffness varying 100 times (kn = 1 GPa/m, kn = 10 GPa/m and \n\nkn = 100 GPa/m). A friction angle (?) of 30\u00b0 was assumed in the foundation discontinuities, \n\nand the joint aperture at nominal zero normal stress (a0) and residual aperture (ares) were \n\nadjusted in such a way that the discharge at the drainage line with a low reservoir level (only \n\n10 m of water height) was the same for the three different models. Numerical simulations \n\nwere carried out applying successive increments of water head at the reservoir bottom and of \n\nhydrostatic pressure in the upstream face of the dam so as to simulate the rising of water in \n\nthe reservoir. In the three different cases this load path was followed by an unload path, \n\nsimulating the filling and subsequent emptying of the reservoir. \n\n \n\n\n\n 65 \n\n200 m\n\n80 m                                \n\n33.8 m                                \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   22-May-09  13:16\n\n  cycle         0 \n\n  time  =  0.000E+00 sec\n\nblock plot                 \n\n-1.000\n\n-0.800\n\n-0.600\n\n-0.400\n\n-0.200\n\n 0.000\n\n 0.200\n\n 0.400\n\n 0.600\n\n(*10^2)\n\n-0.500 -0.300 -0.100  0.100  0.300  0.500  0.700  0.900  1.100\n\n(*10^2)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (blocks)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                              \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Model of a concrete gravity dam on a jointed rock foundation. \n\nFigure 3.6 a) shows the different curves obtained with the different foundation rock masses. \n\nDue to the great difference in drain discharges, only the shape of the curve obtained with the \n\nmost deformable foundation is clearly identified. Therefore, in order to make the shape of the \n\nthree different curves visible, discharges calculated with the three different models were \n\ndivided in each case by the highest discharge. Figure 3.6 b) clearly shows that variations in \n\nreservoir level at low levels do not give rise to the same discharge variation when the water \n\nlevel in the reservoir has an equal increase, but is at a higher level. As expected, the curves \n\ntend to be linear for the lower reservoir levels as discontinuities\u2019 normal stiffness increases. A \n\nlinear relation between discharge and reservoir level would only be obtained in a 2D \n\nnumerical simulation in which the flow between the reservoir and the drainage line were \n\nconfined, in a rock mass with constant permeability and when the hydromechanical effect \n\nwere not taken into account.  \n\nA series of different polynomial curves was adjusted to those shown in Figure 3.6, in order to \n\ndefine the function that better fits the numerical results (Figure 3.7). In the most deformable \n\nfoundation, in which the discontinuities\u2019 normal stiffness is 1 GPa/m, it was found that a \n\nfunction of the type q = f (h\n4\n) would roughly fit the numerical results. Curves defined by \n\npolynomials in which the linear or the quadratic terms are considered are not adequate for the \n\nlower reservoir levels, as the derivative at the origin is almost zero. However, in this case, \n\nthese types of curves match the numerical results well for reservoir levels higher than 25 m. \n\nSuch deformable concrete dam foundations do not actually exist, as concrete dams are built \n\non rock masses which are not easily deformed when subjected to high stresses. In the stiffer \n\nfoundations, polynomials of the type h\n3\n + h or h\n\n4\n + h are adequate, as their graphs \n\napproximately follow the curves which represent the variation in discharges due to variations \n\nin reservoir level.   \n\n\n\n   66 \n\nFigure 3.8 shows the variations in discharges during a cycle of filling and emptying of the \n\nreservoir. There are slight differences in the discharges calculated in the load and unload \n\ncycles, due to the non-linearity of the model. These differences, however, are: i) lower than \n\n1.7 % for the stiffest foundation, ii) lower than 10 % for the rock mass with the normal \n\nstiffness of the discontinuities equal to 10 GPa/m, except for a water height of 5 m, in which \n\nthe difference is around 15 %, and iii) for the most deformable foundation, lower than 10 % \n\nfor the highest reservoir levels. In this latter case, the difference increases for the lower water \n\nlevels, but as such foundations are not likely to exist it can be concluded that with the \n\nassumed friction angle (? = 30\u00b0), which is close to friction angles commonly observed in rock \n\nmasses of average quality (Hoek 2001), the behaviour concerning drain discharges is almost \n\nelastic and therefore the use of quantitative interpretation methods is feasible. \n\n \n\na) \n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n12.0\n\n14.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\nWater height in the reservoir (m)\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)/\n\nm\n)\n\nkn = 1 GPa/m\n\nkn = 10 GPa/m \n\nkn = 100 GPa/m \n\n \n\nb) \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\nWater height in the reservoir (m)\n\nN\no\n\nr\nm\n\na\nli\n\nse\nd\n\n d\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\n-) kn = 1 GPa/m\n\nkn = 10 GPa/m \n\nkn = 100 GPa/m \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Variations in discharges due to variations in the water level in the reservoir, \n\ntaking into account the coupled hydromechanical behaviour of foundation rock masses, for \n\ndifferent discontinuities\u2019 normal stiffness: a) numerical discharges;

It is a double curvature arch dam, almost \n\nsymmetrical, with a maximum height of 110 m, a total length of 297 m between the \n\nabutments at crest elevation and a width that varies at the central cantilever between 4 m at \n\nthe crest and 21 m at the base. The dam was concluded in 1991 and the first filling of the \n\nreservoir took place from 6 January 1992 to 28 April 1994. \n\nThe foundation consists of granite with medium to coarse-sized grains and is of good quality, \n\nshowing, however, some heterogeneity. The main joint sets in the left bank and valley bottom \n\nare in the upstream-downstream direction, with average to sub-vertical dips, and in the right \n\nbank they are sub-vertical and equally distributed between upstream-downstream and right \n\nbank-left bank directions.  \n\nkn \n\nkn \n\nkn \n\n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\nForty four drains were first drilled from the drainage gallery, two per block, with the \n\nexception of the foundation of block 14-15, in which four boreholes were drilled. The length \n\nof the drainage boreholes is around 38 m in the valley bottom and 20 m in both embankments, \n\nwhich in each case is about 2/3 of the length of the grout curtain. Permeability values of 3.0 to \n\n7.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s were obtained in Lugeon type tests carried out in drains.  \n\n3.5.4.2 Monitoring and hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation \n\nAs prescribed in the monitoring plan, 22 piezometers were installed from the downstream \n\narea of the drainage gallery, one per block, with the exception of the central cantilever (block \n\n11-12) in which two piezometers were installed, one vertical and the other dipping towards \n\nupstream. During the first filling of the reservoir, percentages of hydraulic head of about 30 to \n\n40 % were recorded in the valley bottom in the foundation of blocks 12-13, 13-14 and 14-15. \n\nThe greatest discharges were recorded in the foundation of blocks 10-11, 11-12, 12-13 and \n\n14-15, in the valley bottom, which make up around 50 % of the total discharge in the drainage \n\ngallery.  \n\nAfter the first filling of the reservoir, high percentages of hydraulic head were still recorded in \n\nthe foundation, in the valley bottom, below dam blocks 11-12, 12-13 and 13-14, and in the \n\nright bank, below block 18-19. These percentages of hydraulic head, however, were not \n\naccompanied by significant discharges. Between March and May 1998, new drains were \n\ndrilled in those areas, to reduce water pressures, and a new piezometer was installed in the \n\nfoundation of block 11-12. Work carried out allowed not only a significant decrease in water \n\npressures in the foundation of the blocks in the bottom of the valley but also an improvement \n\nin the drainage of the foundation of block 18-19. More recently, in January 2004, due to an \n\nincrease in piezometric readings, the drains located in blocks 7-8 and 8-9 were cleaned and \n\nunblocked when necessary. Further cleaning was carried out in June 2005 in all drains and \n\npiezometers located in blocks 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18 and 18-19. Figure 3.9 \n\nshows the drainage and piezometric systems in the dam foundation. \n\nThe drained water, together with that from leakage, is collected in three seepage measuring \n\nweirs, which separate the discharges by specific areas (Figure 3.9): the first measures the \n\ndischarges from the left bank, between blocks 1-2 and 9-10; the second those from the right \n\nbank, between blocks 14-15 and 21-22 and the third collects not only the water from the first \n\ntwo, but also that collected in the valley bottom. In this dam, the quantity of water from \n\nleakage is very low. Figure 3.10 shows recorded discharges in these three seepage weirs \n\nplotted versus time. The same figure shows the variation in the reservoir level. Chart analysis \n\nshows that discharges have been decreasing, most probably due to clogging of both the rock \n\nmass discontinuities and the drainage system. \n\n\n\n   70 \n\n340\n\n330\n\n320\n\n310\n\n300\n\n290\n\n280\n\n270\n\n260\n\n250\n\n240\n\n230\n\n350\n\n(m)\n\nDrainage borehole\n\nSeepage measuring weir\n\nPiezometric borehole\n\nP10/11\n\n200\n\n190\n\nR.B. - Right Bank\n\nL.B. - Left Bank\n\nR.B. 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 L.B.\n\n220\n\n210\n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 \u2013 Drainage and piezometric systems in the foundation of Alto Lindoso dam. \n\n \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28 2009-12-27\n\nDate\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\n280\n\n300\n\n320\n\n340\n\n360\n\nR\ne\nse\n\nr\nv\n\no\nir\n\n l\ne\nv\ne\nl \n\n(m\n)\n\n measuring weir 1  measuring weir 2  measuring weir 3  reservoir level\n \n\nFigure 3.10 \u2013 Variation in the reservoir level and recorded discharges in the measuring weirs. \n\n3.5.4.3 Quantitative interpretation of discharges recorded in a single drain \n\nIn Alto Lindoso dam, the highest discharges are recorded in the foundation of the blocks \n\nlocated in the valley bottom. The only block in which no drains or piezometric boreholes have \n\nbeen drilled since the beginning of the first filling of the reservoir is block 10-11 and thus the \n\n340\n\n330\n\n320\n\n310\n\n300\n\n290\n\n280\n\n270\n\n260\n\n250\n\n240\n\n230\n\n350\n\n(m)\n\n\n\n 71 \n\ndecision was made to analyse discharges recorded in drain D10/11.1 located in this block \n\n(Figure 3.9). Although the opening of new drains can affect the flow pattern in quite a wide \n\nfoundation area, it was assumed that in the foundation of block 10-11 there had been no \n\nsignificant changes, which allowed quantitative interpretation of recorded discharges to be \n\nmade taking into account discharges recorded since the beginning of reservoir filling. Figure \n\n3.11 shows the variation of recorded discharges and water pressures in block 10-11 over time. \n\nDischarges in both drains have been decreasing (drains D10/11.1 and D10/11.2 shown in \n\nFigure 3.9). The water pressure in piezometer P10/11 (Figure 3.9) increased from the end of \n\n1998 until the beginning of 2003, but has apparently been stable since then, varying with the \n\nvariations in the reservoir level. The percentages of hydraulic head recorded at this \n\npiezometer are lower than 16 %, and therefore of no concern. \n\nThe study started with a very simple quantitative interpretation with the effect of the \n\nhydrostatic pressure represented by a function of h\n3\n + h and the time effect represented by a \n\ncubic polynomial (t\n3\n, t\n\n2\n, t). A series of quantitative interpretations was afterwards carried out, \n\nonly changing one function or introducing one new function each time, in order to analyse its \n\ninfluence on the results. Different periods of time were used to calculate the curve that better \n\nfits recorded data in each analysis. This curve was used to predict discharges, and these \n\npredictions were compared with discharges measured in the subsequent period of time. \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.1\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28 2009-12-27\n\nDate\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n) \n\no\nr\n w\n\na\nte\n\nr\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nb\na\n\nr\n)\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\n280\n\n300\n\n320\n\n340\n\n360\n\nR\ne\nse\n\nr\nv\n\no\nir\n\n l\ne\nv\ne\nl \n\n(m\n)\n\n D 10/11.1  D 10/11.2  P 10/11  reservoir level  \n\nFigure 3.11 \u2013 Recorded discharges and water pressures in the foundation of block 10-11.  \n\n\n\n   72 \n\nFigure 3.12 to Figure 3.16 show results of some experiments in which curves calculated with \n\ndata recorded until the end of 2003 were used to predict discharges from then until mid-\n\nFebruary 2008. These figures, in addition to the influence lines of each effect, show the \n\nparameters which define the calculated curve, the comparison between recorded and both \n\ncalculated and predicted discharges, and the errors of the analysis. Similar charts are at the \n\nsame scale, in order to make comparisons easier. The independent term (k), was added to the \n\ntime effect.  \n\nResults of the first interpretation carried out are shown in Figure 3.12. The effect of the \n\nhydrostatic pressure was afterwards represented by a function of h\n4\n + h, instead of h\n\n3\n + h \n\n(Figure 3.13). A third analysis was carried out in which the thermal effect was included \n\n(Figure 3.14). This was simulated with the simplified method developed by Willm and \n\nBeaujoint (1967), in which the thermal effect in each point of the structure is assumed to be \n\nindependent and seasonal, taking into account that in the Portuguese climate the most \n\nimportant wave is that of annual period (Teles 1985). The time effect was then represented by \n\nan exponential curve and by a both linear and exponential curve (Figure 3.15 and Figure \n\n3.16). Analysis of the above-mentioned figures together shows that: \n\n1. the effect of hydrostatic pressure is of the same order as the time effect; \n\n2. the hydrostatic pressure effect can be either simulated by a function of h\n3\n + h or of \n\nh\n4\n + h and, in this case, the linear term is dominant; \n\n3. the thermal effect is very low; \n\n4. the time effect is well approximated by a cubic polynomial. \n\nThe general trend in discharge variations is reasonably approximated by the first three \n\ninterpretations, in which the time effect is represented by a cubic polynomial. However, the \n\ncalculated curves do not fit recorded discharges well neither in the period of the first filling of \n\nthe reservoir, in which there are significant differences between recorded and calculated \n\ndischarges, nor in the subsequent period. None of the curves was considered adequate to \n\npredict discharges, as errors increase in the period in which predictions are made. In reality, a \n\nquantitative interpretation is an interpolation, only valid in the range of variation of the main \n\nloads and over the period of time considered in the analysis. In some cases, like those \n\npresented here, quantitative interpretations can not be used as a model to predict future \n\nbehaviour.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 73 \n\nAlto Lindoso dam\n\nEffect of hydrostatic pressure\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\nreservoir level (m)\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nThermal effect \n\n-0.03\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.01\n\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nTime effect + k\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nRecorded discharges, calculated curve and predicted discharges\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nDifference between recorded and both calculated and predicted discharges \n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nPredicted and recorded discharges\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n \n\n \n\n \nh\n\n3\n \n\n1.8658 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n \n\nh \n3.9278 \u00d7 10\n\n-3\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \ncos (2 ?

In a first interpretation, the effect of the hydrostatic pressure was \n\nrepresented by a function of h\n3\n and the time effect by a cubic polynomial (Figure 3.17). In this \n\ncase the effect of hydrostatic pressure becomes significant, unlike what was observed in \n\nanalysis of discharges in a single drain, in which it was close to the time effect. However, the \n\ntime effect is not well fitted and predictions are not good. An exponential curve was then used \n\nto simulate the time effect and the results were much better, as shown in Figure 3.18. \n\nHowever, for the highest and lowest discharges, the calculated flows are higher than those \n\nrecorded (the calculated curve exaggerates the peaks), which means that the effect of the \n\nhydrostatic pressure is higher than it should be. Taking this second interpretation as reference, \n\nanother two were carried out by adding a linear term to simulate the time effect and by taking \n\ninto account the thermal effect (Figure 3.19 and Figure 3.20). Figure 3.19 shows that when a \n\nlinear term in h is used the curve which represents the effect of the hydrostatic pressure does \n\nnot make sense, due to the lack of recorded discharges for water heights in the reservoir lower \n\nthan 72 m. In this case, quantitative interpretations are better carried out with the effect of the \n\nhydrostatic pressure represented by a function of h\n3\n. As in the analysis of seepage in a single \n\ndrain, the thermal effect is very low (Figure 3.20). \n\n3.5.5 Quantitative interpretation of discharges recorded in Alqueva dam \n\n3.5.5.1 Main characteristics of Alqueva dam \n\nMost of the studies developed in this thesis were carried out with data from Alqueva dam, \n\nwhich is described in detail in the next chapter. Therefore, only the features relevant to the \n\nquantitative interpretation of discharges are referred to here. Alqueva dam is a 96 m high \n\ndouble curvature arch dam of which the foundation consists of green schist and phyllite. Dam \n\nconstruction ended in 2003 and the first filling of the reservoir began in February 2002 and is \n\nnearly complete. There are five drains per dam block, located 3 m apart. The total discharge is \n\naround 100 to 150 l/min, of which around 20 l/min are from the valley bottom. \n\n3.5.5.2 Quantitative interpretation of discharges \n\nThe study carried out included quantitative interpretations of discharges recorded in the drain \n\nof the valley bottom that collects the highest quantity of water (drain D25 D) and of \n\ndischarges collected in the drainage gallery in an area which encompasses the bottom of the \n\nvalley. Recorded discharges are shown in Figure 3.21, where it can be seen that there are large \n\nvariations in discharges which are not justified by variations in the reservoir level. Figure 3.22 \n\nto Figure 3.25 show results of some interpretations.  \n\n\n\n 79 \n\nAlto Lindoso dam  intq1\n\nEffect of hydrostatic pressure\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\nreservoir level (m)\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nThermal effect \n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nTime effect + k\n\n-12\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nRecorded discharges, calculated curve and predicted discharges\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nDifference between recorded and both calculated and predicted discharges\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)\n\nPredicted and recorded discharges\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n1992-01-01 1993-12-31 1995-12-31 1997-12-30 1999-12-30 2001-12-29 2003-12-29 2005-12-28 2007-12-28\n\n \n\n \n\n \nh\n\n3\n \n\n1.8196 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \ncos (2 ?

In Alqueva dam, there are \n\nlarge variations in discharges which are not justified by variations in the reservoir level, \n\ntherefore a simpler function, such as a logarithm or an exponential, is more adequate to \n\nsimulate the time effect. \n\nThe study was carried out in a similar manner to that in Alto Lindoso dam. Due to the large \n\nvariations in recorded discharges, a simple logarithmic or an exponential function is more \n\nadequate to simulate the time effect than a cubic polynomial curve, which tends to adjust to \n\nvariations. Figure 3.22 shows the results of both interpretation and prediction of discharges in \n\ndrain D25 D. In this case, the time effect is around half of that due to hydrostatic pressure and, \n\nalthough the calculated curve follows a pattern close to that defined by recorded discharges, \n\nthe prediction deviates from monitored data. Much more accurate predictions can be obtained \n\nwith discharges recorded in the valley bottom, as shown in Figure 3.23.

Simplified methods \n\ntraditionally used in the interpretation of the monitoring data, such as quantitative \n\ninterpretation methods, are relevant not only to evaluate measured behaviour but also to detect \n\nchanges in dam behaviour at an early stage, so that corrective measures can be taken in due \n\ntime. The study presented in this chapter focused on quantitative interpretation of discharges, \n\nand for this the shape of the influence line of the hydrostatic pressure on discharges in a \n\nconcrete dam foundation was first established using a numerical model. Using polynomial \n\nfunctions of which the graph adequately follows the shape of the above-mentioned influence \n\nline, a series of quantitative interpretation analysis was carried out. Discharges recorded in \n\nboth single drains and seepage measuring weirs of two different dams were analysed. The \n\nstudy carried out highlighted the difficulties in interpreting recorded discharges, as they are \n\nnot the sum of a series of structural responses which can be clearly identified, but despite this \n\nthe following conclusions could be drawn:  \n\ni) the effect that variations in reservoir level have on discharges is adequately \n\nsimulated by polynomials of the type h\n3\n + h or h\n\n4\n + h, except when there is a lack \n\nof recorded discharges for lower water levels in the reservoir, in which the effect is \n\nbetter simulated by a function of  h\n3\n; \n\nii)  the effect that variations in ambient temperature have on discharges is very small, \n\nand can often be neglected; \n\niii) discharges recorded in single drains are largely due to localised flow behaviour \n\nand, unlike what happens with dam displacements, in which in most cases the time \n\neffect can be correlated with a variation in dam concrete deformability  over time, \n\nthe time effect does not necessarily reflect an increase or decrease in the \n\npermeability of the discontinuities which cross the drain being studied. \n\nWhen applied to the analysis of discharges, the method of quantitative interpretation is far \n\nmore limited than when used in the analysis of dam displacements, due to the great influence \n\nthat the part given by the time effect plus the independent term has on the results. In fact, \n\nwhen analysing displacements, this part is usually significantly lower than the effect of \n\nhydrostatic pressure, while in the analysis of discharges presented here it is about half of that \n\ndue to hydrostatic pressure.  However, results show that this type of analysis can be useful. \n\nIndeed, it is concluded that the quantitative interpretations may be used to approximately \n\n\n\n 89 \n\npredict discharges collected in seepage weirs in a short period of time in which it can be \n\nassumed that the trend of the time effect will remain the same. \n\nQuantitative interpretations were carried out for discharges recorded in Alto Lindoso and \n\nAlqueva dams and in both dams it is evident that for a given water level, the highest \n\ndischarges are recorded when that level is reached for the first time. This can be due to the \n\nhigher rate of variation of the reservoir level, which occurs during the first filling of the \n\nreservoir, and which may have an influence on the unblocking of seepage paths.  \n\nThe analysis was based on the assumption that discharges vary instantaneously with \n\nvariations in the main loads. In fact, readings of discharges in Alto Lindoso dam, taken with \n\nan automated system in a short period of time in which there were significant changes in the \n\nreservoir level, were compared with the part due to variations in hydrostatic pressure obtained \n\nin a quantitative interpretation (Figure 3.26) and it was concluded that, in this case, there was \n\nno time lag. Results shown in Figure 3.26 are from a quantitative interpretation similar to that \n\npresented in Figure 3.18, in which the effect of the hydrostatic pressure is represented by a \n\nfunction of h\n3\n, the thermal effect by a seasonal wave, and the time effect by an exponential \n\ncurve. \n\nAdditionally, an attempt was made to calculate the time necessary to reach steady-state in a \n\nhydromechanical analysis, using the code UDEC and the model which was referred to in \n\nsection 3.5.2. Analysis, of which the results are shown in Figure 3.6 to Figure 3.8, was carried \n\nout with a highly efficient special algorithm within UDEC that converges rapidly to the steady \n\nstate. In transient analysis, the explicit step by step algorithm requires the fluid timestep to be \n\nlimited, so as to ensure numerical stability. This timestep is given by: \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.26 \u2013 Variations in both reservoir level and total discharges recorded with an \n\nautomated system (a) and comparison of the total discharges with the part due to variations in \n\nhydrostatic pressure obtained in a quantitative interpretation (b). \n\n\n\n   90 \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?i iw\nf\n\nkK\n\nV\nt min  \n\n(3.3) \n\nwhere V = domain volume; Kw = water bulk modulus; and the summation of the UDEC \n\npermeability factors ki is extended to all contacts surrounding the domain. In UDEC, a \n\n\u201cdomain\u201d is a segment of a joint (domain volume = joint aperture \u00d7 length of joint segment). \n\nThe minimum value of all the timesteps over all the model\u2019s domains is used in the analysis. \n\nIn the case studied, the timestep is around 10\n-8\n\n s and the time required to run 1,000,000 cycles \n\nis around 2 hours. Flow time is obtained by multiplying the number of cycles by the timestep, \n\nand therefore a run time of two hours only simulates 0.02 s of flow. Therefore, transient fluid \n\nflow analysis is impractical in relatively large models and with small joint apertures, such as \n\nthose necessary to analyse flow in dam foundations. \n\nThe influence lines due to the hydrostatic effect should represent the permeability of the area \n\nbeing analysed. Additional studies could include quantitative interpretations carried out for \n\ndifferent periods of time, gradually longer, but using the same functions to represent the two \n\nmain effects. This would lead to different influence lines of the hydrostatic effect that should \n\nonly change slightly from one analysis to another, and could be a way of quantifying \n\nphenomena such as clogging of the rock mass. Another issue that requires further attention \n\nwhen analysing discharges collected in measuring weirs is the fact that for different reservoir \n\nlevels the water may be collected from a different number of drains. Quantitative \n\ninterpretation should be carried out always using the same drainage system, which means that \n\nonly water collected in a limited number of drains, probably those from the lower parts of the \n\ndam, should be used in the analysis.  \n\nThis study shows that it is not possible to predict discharges recorded in single drains, as they \n\nare largely due to local effects and do not represent the permeability of the rock mass. \n\nTherefore, discharges recorded in seepage weirs, collected in relatively large areas, rather than \n\ndischarges in single drains should be analysed. In fact, leakage measurement is only \n\nrepresentative over a certain area, and can be considered an integral factor, reflecting the \n\nbehaviour of the foundation at more than just one point. In this study quantitative \n\ninterpretations were only carried out for discharges, as these are more useful for the \n\nevaluation of foundation performance than water pressures taken in piezometers, which give \n\nonly pointwise information (ICOLD 2005). \n\nThe study leads to the conclusion that with quantitative interpretation analysis it is difficult to \n\nobtain calculated discharges very close to those recorded. However, the general trend in \n\ndischarge variations is easily obtained and the results of this type of analysis can be used to \n\nroughly predict discharges in short periods of time. \n\n\n\n 91 \n\nRecently, other techniques have been proposed to support the assessment of the field data and \n\nresults of quantitative interpretation of dam displacements have been compared with those \n\nobtained using both the neural network approach, in which the model \u201clearns\u201d from the \n\ninformation contained in a training set of data provided by the user (Mata 2007; Perner et al. \n\n2001), and with algorithms which combine a model selection procedure based on the \n\nminimization of the simulation error and a pruning mechanism for the elimination of \n\nredundant terms (Piroddi and Spinelli 2003). These methods may be an alternative, or an \n\nadditional means, to analyse dam behaviour and particularly discharges. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   92 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 93 \n\n4 Borehole water-inflow tests \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nThe information which is most commonly available regarding the hydraulic performance of \n\ndam foundations, namely discharges in the drains and piezometric readings, does not give a \n\nclear indication of seepage patterns underneath the dam (ICOLD 2005). Therefore, to obtain \n\ndetailed information, it is necessary to carry out further tests. Fluid flow in rock masses is \n\nusually investigated in situ performing hydraulic or tracer tests (Bedmar and Aragu\u00e1s 2002; \n\nCommittee on Fracture Characterization and Fluid Flow 1996; Ghobadi et al. 2005). In \n\nhydraulic tests, which are commonly used to obtain estimates of hydraulic conductivity, some \n\nchanges are artificially induced into a restricted area of the foundation and the resulting \n\nresponses are measured. Borehole water-inflow tests are one of the types of test which can be \n\nused to study in situ hydraulic properties and the way in which flow occurs within dam \n\nfoundation rock masses. These tests may provide valuable information about seepage patterns \n\nwithin operating dams\u2019 foundations and offer the great advantage of not inducing any change \n\nin the rock mass. \n\nThis chapter starts by describing borehole water-inflow tests, followed by a description of a \n\nseries of tests carried out in the foundation of two large Portuguese concrete dams: Alqueva \n\narch dam and Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o gravity dam. The main aims of these procedures are presented, along \n\nwith a reference to the equipment necessary to carry out the tests, the way they should be \n\nprepared and conducted, and the key factors to take into account when analysing and \n\ninterpreting results, in order to obtain the largest quantity of information possible. A reference \n\nis made to some studies carried out in three other Portuguese dams where the conclusions \n\ndrawn from the results of borehole water-inflow tests were of major importance. The main \n\ncharacteristics of both Alqueva and Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dams are presented, with emphasis on those \n\nrelated with the foundation. This information is essential not only to analyse test results but \n\nalso to understand studies presented in the three subsequent chapters, which are based on both \n\nthe dimensions and boundary conditions and/or on data recorded in these dams. Tests were \n\ncarried out in a series of drainage and pieozometric boreholes, and the analysis of results led \n\nto a detailed knowledge of seepage patterns in some foundation areas. A brief description of \n\ntests and results is presented for each borehole, followed by results analysis. The main \n\ndifficulties found whilst carrying out tests are referred to and a series of conclusions are \n\ndrawn from the tests done in situ. \n\n\n\n   94 \n\n4.2 Borehole water-inflow tests \n\n4.2.1 Main aim and brief description of tests \n\nThe main aim of borehole water-inflow tests is to understand the flow pattern in a specific \n\narea of the foundation. These tests involve only measuring the discharges and water pressures \n\nin isolated sections of boreholes and are carried out with the aid of a packer, which consists of \n\nan expandable element, usually of stiff, fiber-reinforced synthetic rubber, through which a \n\npipe extends. The packer is inflated inside the borehole at a pre-established level, therefore \n\nallowing the isolation of different test intervals within the borehole. \n\nTests can be carried out with either single or double packers: in the first case the test interval \n\nis defined by the bottom of the borehole and the packer and in the second is the area between \n\nthe two packers. When a single packer is used, tests are usually conducted by raising the \n\nequipment and so the length of the test interval is gradually increased. Figure 4.1 shows, as an \n\nexample, some different stages of water-inflow tests using both single and double packers: \n\nsteps 1, 2 and n allow the measurement of discharges above the upper packer and at the test \n\ninterval, defined either by the packer and the bottom of the borehole (step 1) or by the \n\ndistance between the two packers (steps 2 and n); step n+1 allows the measurement of both \n\nwater pressure at the test interval and quantity of water flowing into the hole above the \n\npacker. The test is conducted in a single borehole, considering and isolating fixed test \n\nintervals and testing the hole in consecutive sections along its length. For each test interval, \n\nflow rates and water pressures are recorded until steady state conditions are achieved. While \n\ntesting, discharges and water pressures are also recorded in the nearby drains and piezometers, \n\nrespectively, which are kept working as normal.  \n\n \n\nstep 1        step 2       step n       step n+1 step 1        step 2       step n       step n+1 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Positioning of packers in the successive steps of borehole water-inflow tests. \n\n\n\n 95 \n\n4.2.2 Testing equipment \n\nEquipment used to carry out borehole water-inflow tests was initially developed for the oil \n\nproduction industry, but its use has spread to other fields, currently being used in permeability \n\ntests, hydraulic fracture tests, grouting for foundation treatment, and in studies of \n\ncontamination, with the collecting of water samples at various depths (Ask et al. 2009; \n\nGiacomel and Rowe 1992; Rowe 2000; Rowe 2001). In addition to the packer, which is the \n\nmain piece of the equipment used in these tests, it is also necessary to have equipment to \n\ni) check the borehole, before carrying out tests; ii) place and keep the packer in position in the \n\nborehole; and iii) measure discharges, water pressures and piezometric levels. A detailed list \n\nof the equipment required is presented in Appendix 1.  \n\nPackers can either be mechanical or hydraulic, depending on the method used to inflate them, \n\nbut hydraulic packers are easier to handle and allow larger dilations. The inflation medium, \n\nwhich is usually water but can also be oil, air, or nitrogen gas, is introduced between the \n\ncentral pipe that goes through the packer and the expandable rubber. The packer\u2019s central pipe \n\nis screwed to a series of other pipes, linking the test interval to the borehole head. In this way, \n\neither the flow rate into the test interval or water pressures can be measured in borehole \n\nwater-inflow tests. \n\nThe choice of the equipment to carry out tests depends on a series of geometric restrictions \n\nand on the rock mass jointing pattern. In concrete dams, tests are usually carried out in \n\ndrainage galleries, and therefore geometric restrictions include: i) the diameter of the pipe at \n\nthe borehole\u2019s head; ii) the borehole\u2019s diameter; iii) the size of the galleries where tests are to \n\nbe carried out; and iv) the inclination of the axis of the borehole in relation to the gallery floor \n\nand sidewalls. In embankment dams, tests are usually carried out in the open air, therefore \n\nonly the first two above-mentioned restrictions need to be taken into account. The packer, \n\nsingle or double, should have a length which is compatible with the jointing pattern and a \n\nsuitable diameter, so as to ensure that, when inflated, the test interval is properly isolated. \n\nAccording to Wittke (1990), a common difficulty when carrying out hydraulic tests with \n\npackers is leakage between the packer and the borehole wall, due to a lack of inflation, or \n\nbetween the test interval and other test branches, through the surrounding rock mass (Figure \n\n4.2). The use of long packer rubber sleeves and hydraulic packers limits leakages, because \n\ntheir greater ability to expand allows greater pressure against the borehole wall.  \n\nIn this study, tests were carried out with a double packer with a diameter of 56 mm, and \n\nexpandable rubbers 0.5 m long. With the aid of a metallic stopper, the equipment is easily \n\nassembled as a single packer. The packer was chosen due to its suitability to conduct tests in \n\nboreholes with a diameter of 76 mm, which is the usual dimension of the drainage boreholes, \n\nwith pipes at the head with an interior diameter of 65 mm. The packer has four extension \n\n\n\n   96 \n\npipes, which are easily screwed together, and allow test intervals of different lengths (1 m, \n\n3 m, 4 m and 5 m). The water pressure is measured with a pressure transducer, calibrated for \n\nreadings from 0 to 20 bar, located 0.825 m above the top of the test interval. The scale of the \n\npressure transducer was chosen so as to be suitable for the maximum water pressures \n\nexpected in Portuguese dams, in which the equipment is going to be used. The water flowing \n\ninto the test interval can reach the borehole\u2019s head through a series of PVC pipes. Figure 4.3 \n\nshows the main parts of the equipment and its geometry is shown in Appendix 1.  \n\n4.2.3 Preparation of tests and test procedures \n\nBorehole water-inflow tests must be carefully prepared taking into account: i) the specific \n\ninformation required; ii) the particular features of the dam where tests are going to be carried \n\nout; and iii) test procedures.  \n\nAs the main aim of borehole water-inflow tests is to obtain information on how seepage \n\noccurs in a certain area of the dam foundation, testing is therefore carried out in a series of \n\nboreholes located in that area and the various test results are analysed and interpreted \n\ntogether. At the preparation stage, it is essential to check if there is any impediment to carry \n\nout tests in any borehole, such as boreholes filled with coarse sand or with geodrains. \n\nRegarding the dam where tests are going to be carried out, it is necessary to ensure the \n\nstability of the dam when performing the tests. This is particularly significant in gravity dams, \n\nbecause they are designed to resist the horizontal thrust of the water entirely with their weight. \n\nHowever, uplift forces, which may increase while testing, reduce the stabilizing effect of the \n\nstructures\u2019 weight. Available geotechnical information of the area to be studied should also be \n\ncarefully analysed, as well as variations in discharges and water pressures, and their relation \n\nwith the reservoir level. This analysis not only allows better knowledge of the foundation \n\narea, but also shows which equipment should be used, namely, pressure gauges with scales \n\nand precision suitable for the expected water pressure and sizes of measuring cylinders. \n\nThere are no pre-established testing methods, thus the tests were developed within this study \n\nto provide information which can be useful in the analysis and safety assessment of any dam \n\nfoundation. Test procedures, which were continuously corrected and improved while carrying \n\nout the tests presented in the next sections, are described in detail in Appendix 1. The test has \n\nfive main stages: \n\ni) firstly, it is necessary to measure discharges and water pressures, not only in the \n\nborehole which is going to be tested but also in the boreholes located in an area \n\nlarger than that its expected area of influence, before placing the equipment; \n\n\n\n 97 \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Common difficulties when carrying out hydraulic tests: a) leakage at the packer; \n\nb) flow around the packer (adapted from Wittke 1990). \n\n \n\na) piece of metal with the same diameter as the \n\nequipment (\u201cblind device\u201d) to check for and \n\nremove, if possible, any obstructions, to make \n\nsure that the equipment will fit \n\nb) equipment assembled as a single packer \n\nc) equipment assembled as a double packer \n\nd) extension pipes, which allow test intervals of \n\ndifferent lengths \n\ne) water and air pumps, to inflate and deflate the \n\npacker \n\nf) recording device for the electric transducer \n\nd)\n\ne)\n\nf)\n\na)                               b)                     c)\n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Main parts of the equipment. \n\nb) a) \n\n\n\n   98 \n\nii) then, a piece of metal with the same diameter as the equipment called \u201cblind \n\ndevice\u201d has to be inserted into the borehole to check for and remove, if possible, \n\nany obstructions, to make sure that the equipment will fit; \n\niii) thirdly, tests are conducted with a single packer; \n\niv) then with a double packer; \n\nv) and finally it is necessary to repeat all the measurements referred to in i) again to \n\nverify if the testing process has altered the seepage pattern. \n\nAfter tests in a series of adjacent boreholes have been carried out, when some knowledge \n\nabout seepage in the area in analysis has already been obtained, it may be of interest to \n\nconduct new tests in some borehole branches, so as to shed light on or confirm hypotheses \n\nconcerning seepage paths. In these new tests, some changes may be introduced into test \n\nprocedures depending on various circumstances which may arise: i) if there is any borehole \n\narea which needs to be analysed in depth, the length of the test interval should be decreased; \n\nii) to confirm the existence of seepage paths linking a test interval and adjacent boreholes, it \n\nmay be necessary to introduce same changes either in the drainage or piezometric systems, by \n\nclosing or opening boreholes; and iii) when water does not reach the borehole\u2019s head, it is \n\npossible to obtain information on seepage velocity within the test interval being studied, \n\nincreasing the water column and carrying out Lefranc type tests. \n\nIt is not easy to estimate the time necessary to carry out tests, as discharges and water \n\npressures should only be taken in steady sate conditions. The period of time necessary to \n\nachieve this state depends on the rock mass permeability: in areas where it is low, it may take \n\nvarious hours or even days; in more pervious foundation areas, steady-state conditions are \n\nquickly achieved. Tests also take longer when the borehole being tested is linked to a large \n\nnumber of other boreholes, as discharges and water pressures must be measured not only in \n\nthe borehole being tested but also in the boreholes located in its area of influence.   \n\nBorehole water-inflow tests can be carried out at any time during the year. However, when \n\nplanning the tests, it should be taken into account that discharges are higher for higher water \n\nlevels. In arch dams, tests are better carried out with high reservoir levels and during the \n\nwinter, when the ambient temperature is low, as, due to arch dams\u2019 behaviour, this is when \n\nthe aperture of the discontinuities within the rock mass close to the heel of the dam is greater.  \n\n4.2.4 Analysis of test results \n\nAnalysis of borehole water-inflow test results should be carried out in a qualitative way, \n\nexamining recorded data, interpreting charts which can be drawn and checking the \n\n\n\n 99 \n\nconsistency between conclusions drawn from tests and other available information, such as \n\ngeological and geotechnical data of the dam site, boreholes logs, information given by the \n\nborehole driller, and results of other complementary tests, including electrical conductivity \n\ntests and chemical analysis of water. \n\nData collected during tests in successive borehole test intervals allows the drawing of the \n\nfollowing type of charts: i) discharges and water pressures in the equipment placed in the area \n\nof influence of the borehole being tested; ii) discharges and water pressures measured in the \n\nborehole; iii) discharge flowing into each of the borehole\u00b4s test intervals; iv) accumulated \n\ndischarge from the bottom to the head of the borehole; v) discharge above the test interval; \n\nand vi) variations in water pressures along the borehole. Analysis of charts may provide \n\ninformation on: \n\ni) the depth at which the main seepage paths cross the boreholes; \n\nii) the distribution of discharges and water pressures along the boreholes; and \n\niii) seepage paths linking different boreholes. \n\nWith the simultaneous analysis of water pressures and discharges it is possible to draw \n\nconclusions concerning seepage through discontinuities: i) high water pressures and low \n\ndischarges are due to seepage through discontinuities with a very low aperture; ii) high water \n\npressures and discharges reveal that the grout curtain is probably inefficient and that there are \n\nhigh seepage velocities; on the contrary, low water pressures and discharges may either reveal \n\nthat there is an efficient grout curtain, that the rock mass is in the process of becoming more \n\nimpervious due the settlement of sediment within discontinuities, or that the boreholes are \n\nclogged; iii) low water pressures and significant discharges show that discontinuities within \n\nthe foundation are quite open, and that the high quantity of water flows a long way, with high \n\npressure losses. In this case, it can also be concluded that the drainage curtain is in good \n\ncondition. \n\nValuable additional data can be obtained with water electrical conductivity tests, which are \n\neasily and quickly carried out. Taking into account LNEC\u00b4s experience, these tests may \n\nprovide information about the depth at which seepage paths cross each one of the boreholes \n\nwhen discharges are between 0.20 and 3.0 l/min. Discharges lower than 0.20 l/min make \n\nseepage paths undetectable and higher than 3.0 l/min lead to similar readings along the \n\nborehole, due to the consequent high water velocity. \n\n\n\n   100 \n\n4.2.5 Previous use of borehole water-inflow tests in Portuguese dams  \n\nThis section examines some studies carried out in three Portuguese dams (Figure 4.4) where \n\nthe performance and analysis of a series of tests, among them borehole water-inflow tests, \n\nwere of major importance. Despite the fact that the first two are embankment dams, they are \n\nreferred to in this section because when dams have their foundations in rock masses there is \n\nno difference between results analysis of tests carried out in either concrete or embankment \n\ndams.  \n\n4.2.5.1 Beliche dam \n\nBeliche dam is located on River Beliche, in the Algarve, in the south of Portugal. It is a zoned \n\nearth-rockfill dam, with a maximum height of 54 m, slightly curved along its length. The \n\nfoundation rock mass consists of schist and greywacke. The reservoir water is used for \n\nirrigation and water supply. The construction of the dam finished in 1986 and the first filling \n\nof the reservoir in December 1988. \n\nAbout five months after the conclusion of the first filling of the reservoir, in May 1989, a \n\nleakage was detected in the downstream face of the dam, close to the right bank, at around \n\nmid-height of the dam. To understand where the water was coming from and suggest, if \n\nnecessary, a suitable treatment, the additional monitoring equipment, which had already been \n\nstudied, was re-analysed and a series of tests was carried out while opening new piezometric \n\nboreholes in the vicinity of the leakage. To obtain data about the location and relative aperture \n\nof the discontinuities responsible for the water leaking, borehole water-inflow tests with a \n\ndouble packer were carried out. To analyse the seepage paths by trying to detect connections \n\nbetween different discontinuities and between the injection area and other boreholes or \n\nbetween the injection area and the leakage, injection tests with single packers and tracer tests \n\nwere also carried out. Furthermore, water samples were collected and physical and chemical \n\nproperties of the water in the foundation and of the leakage were compared (Pinto et al. 1991). \n\nThe tests were carried out, mainly to detect the seepage path towards the leakage. If the \n\nseepage path was through the dam body it would be necessary to take some measures to avoid \n\npiping. The  results  of  the  injection  and  borehole water-inflow tests  and  of  tracer tests  \n\nled to the conclusion that the seepage path towards the leakage crossed the foundation, which \n\nis a schistose rock mass, with a low probability of erosion. As the high uplift pressures \n\nrecorded were not a danger to the dam stability and safety, no foundation treatment was \n\nsuggested, and it was decided that it would be sufficient to control the discharges in the \n\nleakage over time. In the tracer tests carried out, although different tracers were used, it was \n\nonly possible to draw some conclusions from the use of sodium chloride. The tests led to the \n\nconclusion  that   the   dye   tracers  were  adsorbed  onto   the   foundation  rock  mass.  Some \n\n\n\n 101 \n\n   \n\nBeliche dam Santa \u00c1gueda dam  Funcho dam \n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Portuguese dams where borehole water-inflow tests were carried out. \n\ndeficiencies were found during the borehole water-inflow test performance related to the \n\nsmall size of each packer (only 20 cm) and to the difficulty of pumping water from the test \n\ninterval (Pinto et al. 1991).  \n\n4.2.5.2 Santa \u00c1gueda dam (Marateca dam) \n\nSanta \u00c1gueda dam, also known as Marateca dam is located on the River Ocreza, about 15 km \n\nto the north of Castelo Branco, the capital of Beira Baixa. The construction of the dam was \n\nconcluded in 1991. It is a homogeneous earth-fill dam, with a dipping filter in the downstream \n\nslope. The dam has a total length of 1054 m and a maximum height of 25 m. Water is used to \n\nsupply Castelo Branco and for irrigation. The foundation consists of granite with two micas, \n\nmainly biotitic. \n\nIn this dam, after about five years of use, some leakages were detected in the downstream area \n\nof the dam, close to the right bank. The analysis of the uplift pressures recorded in different \n\npiezometers led to the conclusion that there could be significant seepage through the \n\ndownstream slope of the dam. If the interstitial pressures were high this seepage could lead to \n\nhydraulic lifting and progressive erosion of material from the rock mass discontinuities. Thus, \n\nto monitor interstitial water pressures, it was decided to install new piezometers in that area of \n\nthe embankment (LNEC 1997b). \n\nTo identify the main seepage paths and to evaluate the way in which seepage occurred along \n\nthe boreholes, different tests were carried out, namely injection tests and borehole water-\n\ninflow tests. The tests were carried out in breaks between drilling. The rotary drilling was \n\ndone with water and allowed the recovery of rock samples. The identification of the \n\ndiscontinuities and of the areas of highest permeability made it possible to choose the best \n\nplace for the piezometric chambers in each borehole (LNEC 1997b). \n\n4.2.5.3 Funcho dam \n\nFuncho dam is located on the River Arade, close to the city of Silves, and is part of the \n\nOdelouca-Funcho system, of the Algarve Hydraulic Development, which provides water \n\n\n\n   102 \n\nsupply, for irrigation, for a large area of the Algarve. It is a double curvature arch dam with \n\nartificial abutments and a thick base. The dam has 49 m of maximum height, 165 m of \n\ndevelopment at the crest and the thickness varies, in the central cantilever, from 6.5 m at the \n\nbase, to 2.25 m at the crest. The retention water level is 96.0 m. The dam construction ended \n\nin 1991 and the first filling of the reservoir, which started at the beginning of November 1992, \n\nwas only concluded in January 2001. The foundation rock mass, highly heterogeneous and \n\nanisotropic, consists of schist and greywacke (DGRAH 1978).  \n\nThe long period taken for the first filling of the reservoir was due to the need for successive \n\nfoundation treatments, which made it necessary to hold the filling (LNEC 2005a). Foundation \n\ntreatment included injections in the concrete/rock mass interface, consolidation and grouting. \n\nThe first strengthening of the grout curtain was done in 1992 because, before the beginning of \n\nthe first filling of the reservoir, with the reservoir at a relatively low elevation, high flow rates \n\nwere recorded at the drainage curtain (LNEC 1990). At the beginning of 1996, with the \n\nreservoir at an elevation of 94.0 m, the filling of the reservoir was halted again, due to some \n\nlocal high flow rates. The design of the second strengthening of the grout curtain was done by \n\nthe dam owner, Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), who requested that the dam designer, COBA, \n\nrevise the design and give technical assistance and that LNEC analyse the dam behaviour \n\nwhile the foundation treatment was being carried out (LNEC 1998b). \n\nAfter carrying out a series of borehole water-inflow and injection water tests in various \n\ndrainage boreholes, the foundation treatment was slightly altered (LNEC 1998a). The tests \n\ncarried out gave some information about the probable efficiency of injection with cement \n\ngrout. This information made it possible to avoid the drilling and injection of some boreholes, \n\nwhich had previously been defined. In one of the areas tested instead of opening and injecting \n\nnew boreholes it was decided to inject the bottom of two different drains which were too long \n\nand extended below the lower part of the grout curtain, thus reducing the total discharge. This \n\ninjection was done without reducing the drainage efficiency, as the water pressure due to \n\nwater entering the bottom of the boreholes, was very low. The results of the borehole water-\n\ninflow tests led to a detailed knowledge of the main seepage paths which allowed not only the \n\nreduction of costs but also the reduction of the time required to conclude the foundation \n\ntreatment. \n\n4.3 Main characteristics of the dams where tests were carried out \n\nBorehole water-inflow tests were carried out as part of this study in Alqueva and Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o \n\ndams, both owned by Empresa de Desenvolvimento e Infra-Estruturas do Alqueva (EDIA) \n\nand designed by EDP (EDP 1988; EDP 1994; HIDRORUMO 1999; HIDRORUMO 2001; \n\nMiranda and Maia 2004). Both dams are located on the River Guadiana, in the southeast of \n\n\n\n 103 \n\nPortugal and are part of a multipurpose development designed for irrigation, energy \n\nproduction and water supply. \n\nAlqueva dam is the main structure of the development and creates the largest artificial lake in \n\nWestern Europe, with storage capacity of 4150 hm\n3\n and a surface area of 250 km\n\n2\n at the \n\nretention water level, of which 215 km\n2\n are in Portugal and 35 km\n\n2\n in Spain.  \n\nPedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam is located about 23 km downstream from Alqueva dam, and creates a reservoir \n\nwith storage capacity of 54 hm\n3\n which not only allows the turbines of Alqueva dam to work \n\nin a reverse motion, by pumping water from the downstream to the upstream reservoir, but \n\nalso provides water for irrigation and for energy production. It is the first roller compacted \n\nconcrete (RCC) dam built in Portugal. \n\n4.3.1 Alqueva dam \n\n4.3.1.1 General description of the dam \n\nAlqueva dam is a double curvature arch dam, with artificial abutments. The structure is \n\nextended on the left bank by a group of gravity blocks where a surface spillway is inserted, \n\nfollowed by a structure which closes the valley. The dam has a maximum height of 96 m, a \n\ntotal length of 348 m between the abutments at the crest elevation, and a length of 140 m in \n\nthe bottom of the valley (Figure 4.5, Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7). Figure 4.8 shows the dam\u2019s \n\ncentral cross section. The dam width is 7 m at the crest, while at the base it varies from 30 m \n\nat the central cantilever to 33 m at the abutments. The crest is located at an elevation of \n\n154.0 m and carries a road which links the towns of Moura and Portel. The powerhouse is \n\nlocated at the toe of the dam. Downstream from the dam is a concrete dam-wall, with a \n\nmaximum height of 55 m, which protects the powerhouse and the substation from the \n\ndownstream reservoir, created by Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam (EDP 1994).  \n\nThe dam has 35 independent concrete blocks: 24 in the arch, 3 in the right abutment, 4 in the \n\nleft abutment and 4 in the closing structure of the left bank. It has four main inspection \n\ngalleries, GV1 to GV4, with floors at elevations of 147.0 m, 126.0 m, 105.0 m, and 84.0 m \n\nrespectively, and a drainage gallery (GGD) which is aligned with the insertion of the dam in \n\nthe foundation and has its floor, at the lowest level, at an elevation of 61.0 m. In the \n\nabutments, the galleries GV1, GV2 and GGD are split into two galleries, one close to the \n\nupstream face of the dam and the other one approximately halfway between the upstream \n\ngallery and the downstream face of the dam. In the bottom of the valley the drainage gallery is \n\nalso split into two galleries, one close to the upstream face and the other one known as the \n\ndownstream drainage gallery (GDJ). The latter extends towards the right bank in a branch \n\n\n\n   104 \n\nexcavated into the rock mass. The dam-wall has a drainage gallery with the floor in the area \n\ndownstream from the powerhouse at an elevation of 42.0 m. \n\nIn the bottom of the valley the interface concrete/rock mass is at an elevation of 58.0 m, 3 m \n\nbelow the floor of GGD, with the exception of the area at the heel of these blocks, where a \n\nfoundation plinth 6 m wide was built with its base at an elevation of 55.0 m. At the top of the \n\nplinth (58.0 m) there is a peripheral joint (concrete-concrete joint) introduced to avoid vertical \n\nstresses in the foundation with the filling of the reservoir. The width of the peripheral joint \n\nvaries from one block to another, from 7.25 m up to 9.0 m (Figure 4.9).  \n\nThe construction of the dam began in 1997 and ended in 2003. The first filling of the reservoir \n\nbegan in February 2002 and is still not finished, because, after reaching a water level of 150.0, \n\nthe dam began operating in normal conditions.

The \n\nstudies included site reconnaissance investigation and foundation characterization. Several \n\nborehole core drilling surveys were carried out, with a total drilling length of 3750 m, most of \n\nthem simultaneously doing Lugeon type tests. LNEC conducted a series of in situ and \n\nlaboratory tests. In situ tests included geophysical surveys (seismic refraction spreads, seismic \n\ntomography and electrical resistivity soundings) and foundation deformability evaluation \n\n(plate loading (jacking) tests on exposed rock galleries, flat jacks inserted into exposed rock \n\nsurfaces, and borehole jacks with dilatometer) (LNEC 1970; LNEC 1973; LNEC 1975; \n\nLNEC 1986; LNEC 1995). Laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate anisotropy and to \n\ndetermine shear strength (UCS, ?, and c). The shear strength of discontinuities was also \n\nstudied in the laboratory (LNEC 1984). While excavating and building the dam and the \n\npowerhouse, more geological and geotechnical investigation was carried out, mainly in the \n\nleft bank where the main fault within the project area is located (LNEC 1998a; LNEC 1999b; \n\nLNEC 1999c; LNEC 2002; LNEC 2003; Neves and Gon\u00e7alves 2002). \n\nThe foundation is heterogeneous and consists of good quality green schist in the right bank \n\nand the river bottom and of quite good phyllite, with a higher deformability, in the left bank. \n\nAccording to in situ tests carried out prior to dam construction the foundation Young\u2019s \n\nmodulus in the left bank varied from 6 to 20 GPa, and the foundation of the right bank and of \n\nthe bottom of the valley had a Young\u2019s modulus greater than 20 GPa (Liberal et al. 2002; \n\nLNEC 1973; Neiva et al. 1997). Table 4.1 shows the average cohesion and friction angle of \n\ndiscontinuities in the two different foundation areas. The area of the phyllite is more fractured \n\nand is crossed by several faults, the most important being fault 22, which corresponds to the \n\ngreen schist/phyllite interface. \n\n \n\n Discontinuities Cohesion Friction \n\nangle  \n\n  c (MPa) ?

The green schist looks highly dense and, in \n\ngeneral, schistosity is barely evident and subparallel to bedding planes. There are, however, \n\nsome local zones where these rocks have a very visible schistosity which corresponds in most \n\nof the cases to inclusions of chlorite schist (EDP 2006). \n\nVarious sets of rock joints were identified, of which the most prevailing are: A) N40?-65?W, \n\n12?-65?NE; B) N75?W, S75?W; 65?N-90-55?S; C) N65?-90?W,12?-55?NNE; \n\nD) N20?-42?W, 65?-90?ENE and E) N25?-55?W, 65?SE-90? (EDP 2003). Figure 4.10 shows \n\nthe average position of the main sets of rock joints in relation to the dam. Several faults, \n\naligned with some joint sets, are shown on the surface foundation map, especially in the left \n\nbank, but their width is, in general, less than 10 cm, with the exception of fault 22. This latter \n\nis, in fact, not a single fault but a geological entity bordered at hanging and foot by two almost \n\nparallel faults, with a filling of highly deformable phyllite and with widths lower than a few \n\ntenths of centimetres, although locally larger than 1 m. The material between these two faults \n\nis fractured and crushed phyllite. The width of this geological entity varies between 3 and \n\n12 m, and the dip angle can be close to 45\u00b0. The main faults/fault zones observed, shown in \n\nFigure 4.11, and the sets of rock joints to which they belong are (EDP 2006):  \n\n- zone of fault 22 (set C) in the left bank, below the arch and the abutment; \n\n- fault 66 (set A) in the left bank, crossing the foundation of block 1-2; \n\n- fault 29 (set D) in the left bank, crossing the foundation of block 1-2; \n\n- zone of faults17/18 (set A) in the central zone of the bottom of the valley, crossing \n\nthe dam foundation (blocks 12-13 and 13-14) and the powerhouse foundation; \n\n- fault 19 (set A) in the bottom of the valley, crossing the powerhouse foundation \n\nand the dam foundation, below blocks 10-11 and 11-12. \n\nMost of the joints in phyllite belong to set A, with a short trace length (&lt;10 m), small gaps \n\n(&lt;0.20 m) and smooth to slightly rough surfaces. In the green schist joints show a very high \n\npersistence (> 20 m), with spacing larger than 0.60 m and have rough to very rough surfaces \n\n(EDP 2006). \n\nThe surface foundation map was prepared using the terminology and symbols suggested in \n\n(ISRM 1978; ISRM 1981), and, according to these classifications, the right bank and valley \n\nbottom foundation rock mass, where the green schist occurs, is fresh to slightly weathered \n\n(W1 to W2) and the mean distance between successive discontinuities measured along an \n\nintersecting straight line is wide to moderate (F2 to F3). Close to the main faults the fracture \n\n\n\n   108 \n\nspacing decreases (F4 to F5). In the left bank foundation, which consists mainly of phyllite, \n\nthe degree of weathering at the surface is W2 to W3. The fracturing intercept of the phyllite \n\nis, in general, F4 to F5 and, less frequently, F3 to F4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Average position of the main sets of rock joints in relation to the dam.  \n\n \n\n22\n\n23\n25\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n3132\n\n34\n\n35\n\n56\n\n57\n\n(m)\n\n27\n\nGV4\n\nGV3\n\nGV2\n\nGV1\n\n987 10 11 12 1365432\n\n5E 4E\n\n3E 2E 1E 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1D\n\n2D\n\n1\nL.B.

Due to the importance of fault \n\n22 in the structural behaviour of the dam, a special treatment was carried out which included \n\nthe excavation of a set of galleries, the removal of the material inside the fault and its \n\nreplacement with concrete (LNEC 1995; LNEC 1998a; Muralha et al. 2003). Eight \n\nlongitudinal galleries were excavated (levels 1 to 7 and 4a shown in Figure 4.12) from which \n\na series of lateral widening areas were excavated, and filled with concrete. The longitudinal \n\ngalleries were sub-horizontal, in the dam axis direction, and were excavated downwards, from \n\nthe upper levels to the lower ones. The longitudinal galleries were also filled with concrete \n\nwhile the treatment was being carried out, with the exception of two galleries which were \n\nlater used for grouting and which remain open for inspection purposes.

Treatment of fault 17 consisted of placing concrete blocks in the foundation of the \n\ndam and of the powerhouse and in grouting the fault along its dip to a maximum depth of \n\n28.5 m. A small concrete block was also built in the foundation of blocks 10-11 and 11-12, to \n\ntreat fault 19. The foundation of the downstream dam-wall was also subjected to treatment, \n\nwhich included a grout curtain and a drainage curtain, drilled from the foundation gallery. \n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the foundation treatment, geophysical tests were carried out \n\nbefore and after the treatment in vertical boreholes drilled at the base of each one of the \n\nblocks. The method of crosshole and surface to borehole tomography by seismic waves was \n\nused. Results showed that after treatment the field of the velocities of compression waves was \n\nmore homogeneous and that the lowest velocities had increased. While drilling the above-\n\nmentioned boreholes, Lugeon type tests were carried out at several depths (after dam \n\nconstruction but before beginning the grouting injections). The analysis of the results made it \n\npossible to identify zones with different permeability: 2.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s down to about 5 m in \n\ndepth; varying from 2 to 1 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s between 5 and 10 m in depth; and lower than \n\n1.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s for depths greater than 10 m. \n\nThe grout curtain was drilled from the drainage gallery, from gallery GV2 at the base of the \n\nblocks which include the surface spillway of the left bank, and from the right bank. The \n\nboreholes are located 5 m apart and the average length of the grouting boreholes was 41.0 m, \n\nvarying from 26 m to 60 m. In the left bank, in the area of fault 22, secondary boreholes were \n\ndrilled halfway between consecutive primary boreholes, and tertiary boreholes. After \n\ngrouting, the majority of the permeability values obtained in Lugeon type tests conducted in \n\nthe vicinity of the treated area, whilst drainage boreholes were being drilled, were lower than \n\n1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s. \n\nTo relieve uplift pressures at the base of the dam, drainage boreholes with a diameter of \n\n76 mm and located 3.0 m apart were drilled from the drainage gallery, the downstream \n\ndrainage gallery and gallery GV4.  \n\nFigure 4.13 shows the drainage system in Alqueva dam foundation. From gallery GV2, at the \n\nbase of the blocks which include the surface spillway of the left bank, drainage boreholes \n\nwere drilled 6.0 m apart. Due to some difficulties found while drilling, a geodrain was placed \n\nin every borehole of the drainage curtain drilled from the left abutment to the base of block \n\n8-9. From joint 8, in the valley bottom, to the right bank, boreholes were drilled from the \n\nGGD with a dip direction of 257? and dipping 85? (dip direction defined clockwise from \n\nnorth, and dip defined as the angle from the horizontal). The average length of the drainage \n\nboreholes is 27.2 m, varying from 18 m to 52 m. \n\n\n\n 111 \n\nG\nG\n\nD\n\nG\nD\n\nJ\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n1\n6\n\n1\n7\n\n1\n8\n\n1\n9\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n3\n\n2\n42\n5\n\n1\nD\n\n2\nD\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\nE\n\n2\nE\n\n3\nE\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n9\n\nG\nG\nD\nE\nE\n\nR\n.B\n\n.\nL\n\n.B\n.\n\n5\nE 4\n\nE\n\nD\n7\n\n0\nD\n\nD\n7\n\n5\nD\n\nD1E\nD1D\n\nD5D\n\nD10D\n\nD15D\n\nD20D\n\nD25D\n\nD30D\n\nD35D\n\nD40D\n\nD45D\n\nD50D\n\nD55D\n\nD\n6\n\n5\nD\n\nD5E\n\nD10E\n\nD15E\n\nD20\nE\n\nD25\nE\n\nG\nD\n\nJ\n\nD3\n0E\n\nD3\n5E\n\nD4\n0E\n\nD\n50\n\nE\n\nD\n55\n\nE\n\nD\n60\n\nE\nD\n87\n\nE\n\nD4\n5E\n\nD\n92\n\nE\n\nD\n60D\n\nD\n66\n\nE\n\nD\n72\n\nE\nD\n77\n\nE\n\nD\n97\n\nE\n\nG\nV\n\n4\n\nG\nV\n\n3\n\nG\nV\n\n2\n\nG\nV\n\n1\n\n9\n8\n\n7\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n6\n5\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n\n5\nE\n\n4\nE\n\n3\nE\n\n2\nE\n\n1\nE\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n1\n6\n\n1\n7\n\n1\n8\n\n1\n9\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n3\n\n2\n4\n\n2\n5\n\n1\nD\n\n2\nD\n\n1\nL\n\n.B\n.\n\nR\n.B\n\n.\n\nG\nG\n\nD\n\n3\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n6\n0\n\n7\n0\n\n8\n0\n\n9\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n2\n0\n\n1\n3\n0\n\n1\n4\n0\n\n1\n5\n0\n\n1\n5\n4\n\n1\n0\n0\n\nD1E\n\n(m\n)\n\nD1D\n\nD10D\n\nD25D\n\nD25E\n\nD10E\n\nD20E\n\nD15D\n\nD30E\n\nD35E\n\nD40E\n\nD45E\n\nD50E\n\nD55E\n\nD60E\n\nD72E\n\nD77E\n\nD15E\n\nD5E\n\nD5D\n\nD20D\n\nD30D\n\nD35D\n\nD40D\n\nD45D\n\nD50D\n\nD55D\n\nD60D\n\nD65D\n\nD70D\n\nD75D\n\nG\nD\n\nJD\n\nR\n.B\n\n. \n- \n\nR\nig\n\nh\nt \n\nb\na\nn\nk\n\nL\n.B\n\n. \n- \n\nL\ne\nft\n\n b\na\nn\nk\n\nG\nV\n\n1\n t\n\no\n G\n\nV\n4\n -\n\n I\nn\nsp\n\ne\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n g\n\na\nll\n\ne\nri\n\ne\ns\n\nG\nG\n\nD\n -\n\n D\nra\n\nin\na\ng\ne\n g\n\na\nll\n\ne\nry\n\nG\nD\n\nJ \na\nn\nd\n G\n\nD\nJD\n\n -\n D\n\no\nw\n\nn\nst\n\nre\na\nm\n\n g\na\nll\n\ne\nri\n\ne\ns\n\nD\n1\n D\n\n t\no\n D\n\n7\n8\n\n D\n -\n\n D\nra\n\nin\ns \n\no\nn\n t\n\nh\ne\n d\n\na\nm\n\n's\n r\n\nig\nth\n\n h\na\nn\nd\n s\n\nid\ne\n\nD\n1\n E\n\n t\no\n D\n\n9\n7\n\n E\n -\n\n D\nra\n\nin\ns \n\no\nn\n t\n\nh\ne\n d\n\na\nm\n\n's\n l\n\ne\nft\n\n h\na\nn\nd\n s\n\nid\ne\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 Drainage system in Alqueva dam foundation.  \n\n\n\n   112 \n\n4.3.1.4 Foundation behaviour monitoring \n\nThe monitoring system of Alqueva dam includes the measurement of the main loads, namely \n\nthe reservoir level, both the ambient and reservoir water temperature and the seismic \n\nparameters (acceleration time history obtained from three-component strong-motion \n\naccelerographs), and of the following hydraulic and structural effects: water pressures, \n\ndischarges, concrete temperature, displacements, joint movements, strains and stresses. In \n\naddition, some creep cells were installed within the dam body in order to evaluate the \n\ndeformability characteristics of the concrete placed in situ. Two specific Monitoring Plans \n\nwere developed for the follow-up of the actual behaviour during the treatment of fault 22 and \n\nduring the first filling of the reservoir. \n\nIn the dam foundation, displacements are measured with 9 inverted plumb lines (Figure 4.14), \n\n12 borehole (rod) extensometers, and 6 incremental extensometers (Figure 4.15) (LNEC \n\n1997a). The hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation is analysed measuring the discharges \n\nalong the drainage system and the water pressures in a network of piezometers. Piezometers \n\nwere drilled from the drainage gallery, one per dam block, located 15.0 m apart, \n\napproximately halfway between joints (Figure 4.16). They were installed immediately \n\ndownstream from the drainage curtain, and at the same distance from adjacent drains. A \n\nfurther two piezometers were installed in seven of the blocks (25-1D, 21-22, 17-18, 13-14, \n\n8-9, 4-5 e 1E-1) in order to allow measurement of water pressures along the upstream-\n\ndownstream direction. Sets of piezometers were also installed at the substation slab and at the \n\ndownstream dam-wall. \n\nThe dam\u2019s structural behaviour has been as expected based on studies carried out at the design \n\nstage and type C1 predictions (Lambe 1973) from recently developed specific models taking \n\ninto account measurements recorded during construction. Since June 2005, with the water \n\nlevel in the reservoir between 144 m and 150 m, the total discharge has varied from around \n\n100 to 150 l/min, of which 20 l/min is water collected at the drainage gallery, in drains located \n\nin the bottom of the valley. Discharges of around 30 l/min are recorded on the right bank, \n\nwhile on the left bank discharges are approximately 10 l/min. Seeps are observed in the \n\ndrainage gallery, with around 50 l/min in the bottom of the valley and approximately 20 l/min \n\non the right bank. At the dam-wall gallery the total discharge is around 24 l/min. Maximum \n\nwater pressures are of about 6 bar and maximum percentages of hydraulic head are of about \n\n75 %, and are recorded in piezometers which cross the grout curtain in an upstream direction.  \n\nAlthough there are no evident problems, it was decided to study the foundation behaviour of \n\nAlqueva dam during this phase of reservoir filling, in particular in the area of the valley \n\nbottom where the highest discharges are recorded, close to the base of the right abutment. \n\n\n\n 113 \n\nFP1\n\nFP2\n\nFP3\n\nFP4FP5\n\nFP6\n\nFP7\n\nFP8\n\nCOORDINATOR INVERTED PLUMB-LINE\n\n0\n\n(m)\n\nGV4\n\nGV3\n\nGV2\n\nGV1\n\n987 10 11 12 1365432\n\n5E 4E\n\n3E 2E 1E 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1D\n\n2D\n\n1\nL.B.

The dam has an uncontrolled spillway with a length of 301 m with the crest at an \n\nelevation of 84.8 m. This spillway is divided into ten 28.75 m wide spans separated by nine \n\npillars on which a pre-fabricated pathway was installed. The dam has a drainage gallery with \n\nthe floor at elevations 54.0 m and 61.0 m. The crest of the spillway is at the retention water \n\nlevel. The maximum water level is 91.8 m (HIDRORUMO 2001). \n\nThe construction of the dam began in April 2004, block concreting finished in October 2005 \n\nand work was concluded in February 2006, with the first filling of the reservoir already under \n\nway.  In fact, the first filling of the reservoir of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam had begun four months earlier, \n\non 28 October 2005. The water reached an elevation of 84.71 m, 9 cm below the spillway \n\ncrest, on 4 April 2006. \n\n4.3.2.2 Geological-geotechnical conditions \n\nBefore the construction of the dam, detailed geological and geotechnical investigation was \n\ncarried out at the dam site which included a surface geological and geotechnical mapping, the \n\nopening of trenches and shafts, surface seismic and geoelectric prospecting, and the drilling of \n\nboreholes (HIDRORUMO 1999). A detailed logging of samples recovered by drilling was \n\nalso carried out. In situ tests included water pressure permeability tests, dilatometer tests, and \n\ngeophysical surveys. In laboratory the shear strength of discontinuities was determined and \n\nuniaxial compression and ultrasonic tests were carried out on rock samples (LNEC 1999d; \n\nLNEC 2004). \n\nThe foundation consists of granite with small to medium-sized grains and is of good quality \n\nwith the exception of the areas located near two faults in the main river channel and on the \n\nright bank, where the geomechanical properties in depth are weak (HIDRORUMO 2001). To \n\ntake into account the existence of these two areas with weaker properties the depth of the \n\nexcavations in blocks 7-8 and 8-9 was 9.0 m greater than in the adjacent blocks, and blocks \n\nare narrower between dam joints 4 and 5. To decrease stresses upon the foundation the bases \n\nof blocks 7-8 and 8-9 are wider than the base of the other blocks. According to both in situ \n\nand laboratory test results, the foundation Young\u2019s modulus is greater than 4 GPa. Laboratory \n\ntests showed that the normal stiffness of discontinuities (kn) varies from 4.0 to 68.0 MPa/mm \n\nin the loading cycle and from 17.9 to 143 MPa/mm in the unloading cycle. The average shear \n\nstiffness, cohesion and friction angle are ks = 3.7 MPa/mm, c = 0.066 MPa, and ? = 35\u00b0, \n\nrespectively (LNEC 2004).    \n\n\n\n 115 \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.17 \u2013 Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam.

More detailed analysis of data carried out afterwards made it \n\npossible to identify the main joint sets in the different foundation areas (EDP 2004). In the \n\nbottom of the valley these are: a) N50?E-100?E, 70?SSE-90?-70?NNW; b) N30?W-65?W, \n\n70?SW-90?-70?NE; c) N20?E-50?E, 70?NW-90?-75?SE; d) N15?W-20?E, 70?W-90?-65?E; \n\ng) N15?E-80?E, 15?-40?SE. Joint set a) is predominant, with a spacing between \n\ndiscontinuities from lower than 6 cm to 60 cm, trace lengths of 3 m to more than 20 m, \n\nslightly rough to rough, aperture lower than 5 mm and weathered to completely weathered \n\n\n\n   116 \n\n(W3 to W5, according to ISRM terminology) (EDP 2004). Figure 4.19 shows the average \n\nposition of the main sets of rock joints in relation to the dam. EDP (2004) drew attention to \n\nthe fact that the sub-horizontal joints with dip angles lower than 10\u00b0 may be relevant \n\nregarding strength and/or deformability of the dam foundation. In the bottom of the valley \n\nonly a few sub-horizontal discontinuities were observed, but they were difficult to identify as \n\nthe conclusions concerning joint discontinuities were drawn from studies in which mainly the \n\n2 horizontal dimensions were observed. The main faults and fracture alignments, which are \n\nalso the main seepage paths, are aligned in the upstream-downstream direction, occurring \n\nmainly in the foundation of blocks 4-5, 7-8 and 8-9, which are the areas where the \n\ngeomechanical properties in depth are weaker. The different types of granite are adjoined, at \n\nthe surface, along lines in the upstream-downstream direction. Water pressure permeability \n\ntests carried out before the construction of the dam led to the conclusion that the foundations \n\nof blocks 1-2 and 9-10, close to the abutments, and 6-7 and 7-8, in the main river channel, \n\nwere the areas of highest permeability, higher than 2 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s (Figure 4.20). \n\n4.3.2.3 Foundation treatment \n\nFoundation treatment consisted only of a grout curtain along the alignment of the dam. Prior \n\nto this, a group of retaining boreholes was drilled upstream from the grout curtain, to avoid \n\nleakage of grout to the area further away from the dam whilst grouting the main curtain. There \n\nwere several difficulties during grouting due to the fact that cement absorption per metre was \n\nvery low. Lugeon type tests indicated that the initial high permeabilities recorded at the \n\nbeginning of the grouting programme had not decreased even after grouting the quaternary \n\nholes, and therefore the curtain\u2019s desired degree of permeability had not been reached \n\n(Tecnasol FGE 2007). The boreholes were drilled from the drainage gallery and their \n\ndirection was defined taking into account the direction of the main discontinuities. The \n\nmaximum depth of the grout curtain below concrete/rock mass interface is 49.0 m. No \n\nconsolidation grouting was performed. A drainage curtain was drilled from the downstream \n\narea of the gallery. The drains are located 2.5 m apart and the average length of the holes in \n\nthe rock mass is about 21 m, varying from 13 up to 31 m.  The majority of the boreholes were \n\ndrilled with a dip direction of 140? and dipping 60? towards downstream. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 117 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 \u2013 Average position of the main sets of rock joints in relation to the dam. \n\n \n\n4.3.2.4 Monitoring of foundation behaviour \n\nThe monitoring system of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam includes the measurement of the main loads, namely \n\nthe reservoir level, both the ambient and reservoir water temperature and the seismic loads, \n\nand of the following hydraulic and structural effects: water pressures, discharges, concrete \n\ntemperature, displacements, joint movements, strains and stresses. A specific Monitoring Plan \n\nwas developed for the follow-up of the actual behaviour during the first filling of the \n\nreservoir. \n\nIn the dam foundation, displacements are measured with two inverted plumb lines and with 6 \n\nvertical borehole (rod) extensometers and the hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation is \n\nanalysed measuring the discharges along the drainage system and the water pressures in a \n\nnetwork of piezometers. \n\nThe plumb lines were installed in blocks 8-9 and 4B-5. The rod extensometers were installed \n\nin the foundations of blocks 2-3, 4-5, 5-6, 7-8, 8-9 and 11-12, and each one has two rods, one \n\nfixed at a depth of 10 m below the concrete/rock mass interface, to evaluate rock mass \n\ndeformations at shallow depths, and the other at a depth greater than 30 m, to evaluate rock \n\nmass deformations assuming that the lower point does not move. \n\nIn 13 of the dam blocks a piezometer was installed immediately downstream from the \n\ndrainage curtain dipping 50\u00b0, 60\u00b0 or 70\u00b0 towards downstream. A second piezometer, vertical \n\nand with two piezometric chambers, was installed in four of the blocks (4-5, 5-6, 6-7, and \n\na \n\nd \n\nb \n\ng \n\nc \n\n\n\n   118 \n\n7-8), in the downstream area, underneath the stilling basin. These are vibrating-wire \n\npiezometers which allow readings to be taken in the drainage gallery, as they are located in a \n\nnon-accessible area. The location and length of each chamber were defined taking into \n\naccount the boreholes\u2019 logs and the results of Lugeon type tests. Figure 4.21 shows two \n\ndifferent cross sections of the dam. \n\nDue to the possible collapse of borehole walls, coarse sand or geodrains were placed inside \n\nseveral drains between dam joints 2 and 9, the majority of them at the base of blocks 6-7 and \n\n7-8. \n\n \n\nR.B.\n1 2 3\n\nL.B.\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n(m)\n\n3A 4 4A 4B 5 5A 5B 6 6A 6B 7 7A 8 9 10 11 12 13\n\nweak geomechanical properties\n\nareas of highest permeability\n\narea of both weak geomechanical\n\nproperties and high permeability\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 \u2013 Areas of weak geomechanical properties and of highest permeability in the \n\nfoundation of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam. \n\n \n\n \n\n(m)\n\n95\n\n90\n\n85\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\nBlock 7-8Block 6-7\n\nD - drain\n\nP - piezometer\n\nG.C. - grout curtain\n\nD\n\nP\n\nG.C.\n\nD\n\nP\n\nG.C.\n\nP P\n\n \n\nFigure 4.21 \u2013 Cross sections of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam. \n\n \n\n\n\n 119 \n\n4.3.2.5 Foundation hydraulic behaviour \n\nWhen the first filling of the reservoir began, with the water upstream from the dam at an \n\nelevation of 61.0 m, 7.0 m above the floor of the drainage gallery in its lower area, the total \n\ndischarge was already 200 l/min. Since then Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam has shown a peculiar seepage \n\npattern, with some local high flow rates. Figure 4.22 shows the variations in the reservoir \n\nlevel since the beginning of its first filling until the end of April 2006, a week before borehole \n\nwater-inflow tests were carried out. The same figure shows the total and partial recorded \n\ndischarges plotted versus time. Three areas of the foundation are considered: the left bank \n\nincludes blocks 9-10, 10-11, 11-12 and 12-13; the right bank includes blocks 2-3, 3-4 and 4-5; \n\nand the bottom of the valley includes the remaining blocks. \n\nIn the first two months the total discharge reached values of about 650 l/min. The highest \n\ndischarges were recorded in blocks 6B-7 and 7-7A. Due to the high discharges recorded, \n\nsome drains were filled with coarse sand. To further reduce the discharges special devices \n\nwhich allow the regulation of uplift/discharge were installed in some of the drains. With these \n\ndevices, named \u201cpiezodrains\u201d, the total discharge can be reduced, at the same time reducing \n\nseepage velocity through the foundation and controlling the maximum values of the uplift. \n\nThirty six of the 268 drains were changed into piezodrains. There are piezodrains at the base \n\nof all the blocks between dam joints 2 and 9, but they are most concentrated at the base of \n\nblock 6-7 in which 15 out of 23 drains were working as piezometers or as piezodrains when \n\ntests were carried out. These devices were adjusted in the middle of January 2006 in such a \n\nway that the maximum values of the water pressures were lower than 50 % of the reservoir \n\nhead, with the reservoir at 80.4 m. One month later they were adjusted once again and the \n\ntotal discharge was reduced to values not greater than 300 l/min. Since mid-February the \n\nreservoir level has ranged between 78.97 m and 84.71 m.  \n\nFigure 4.23 shows the average values of the water pressures and of the percentage of \n\nhydraulic head along the base of the dam on 4 April 2006, with the reservoir at an elevation of \n\n84.71m. This figure shows that the highest discharges and percentages of hydraulic head were \n\nrecorded at the base of blocks 6-6B and 6B-7. Figure 4.24 shows the variation in water \n\npressures along the upstream-downstream direction, in the foundation of different dam blocks, \n\nrecorded on 4 April 2006. \n\nA dam feature which may contribute to the high flow rates recorded is that the floor of the \n\nlower area of the drainage gallery is about 8.0 m below the water level downstream from the \n\ndam.  \n\n \n\n\n\n   120 \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n2005-10-01 2005-12-01 2006-01-31 2006-04-02 2006-06-02 2006-08-02 2006-10-02\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n65\n\n68\n\n71\n\n74\n\n77\n\n80\n\n83\n\n86\n\nR\ne\nse\n\nr\nv\n\no\nir\n\n l\ne\nv\ne\nl \n\n(m\n)\n\n  Right bank   Bottom of the valley   Left bank   Total   Reservoir level\n \n\nFigure 4.22 \u2013 Partial and total flow rates through the foundation. \n\n \n\nS\nu\n\nb\np\n\nre\ns\ns\n\u00e3\n\no\n (\n\nb\na\n\nr)\n\n  \n P\n\ne\nrc\n\ne\nn\n\nta\ng\n\ne\nm\n\n d\ne\n\nc\na\n\nrg\na\n\n h\nid\n\nr\u00e1\nu\n\nli\nc\na\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n  0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n 0\n\n 20\n\n 40\n\n 60\n\n 80\n\n 100\n\nPiezodreno\n\nME\n\n13121110987654321\n\nMD\n\n3A 4A 4B 5A 5B 6A 6B 7A\n\nR.B.

Tests were \n\nfirst carried out not only with the aim of testing the equipment, which had never been used, \n\nand evaluating the previously defined test procedures, but also because the high flow rates \n\nrecorded in the foundation of this dam were more suitable for testing the equipment and the \n\ntesting method and for comparing the test results against the results of a numerical model. \n\nMoreover, the team responsible for the safety assessment of the dam were also interested in \n\nknowing where water was coming from in some foundation areas. \n\n4.4.1 Preparation of tests \n\n4.4.1.1 Area where tests were carried out \n\nIt was decided that tests should be carried out in the foundation of block 6-7, where the \n\nhighest discharges were recorded. In this block, there were only three boreholes which could \n\nbe tested: D12, D14 and D18. The remaining boreholes were either filled with coarse sand or \n\nwith geodrains, which prevented the insertion of the equipment. Boreholes D12 and D18 were \n\nworking as piezometers, and D14 as a drain. According to the design, boreholes were 26.0 m \n\nlong (HIDRORUMO 2001). Figure 4.25 shows the location of both the drainage and \n\n\n\n   122 \n\npiezometric boreholes in the foundation of block 6-7 and of block 7-8, close to dam vertical \n\njoint 7. \n\n4.4.1.2 Analysis of geological and geotechnical information \n\nThe surface foundation map in the area of block 6-7 shows that the foundation was weathered \n\nat the surface with close to medium spaced rock joints (W3 and F3-F4, according to ISRM \n\nclassification). When the surface foundation map was drawn, there were leakages at the base \n\nof this block, close to dam joint 6. More detailed information was obtained when the grout \n\ncurtain boreholes were drilled. Logs show that the foundation is moderately to highly \n\nweathered, that the boreholes are crossed by close discontinuities (W3-W4 and F4-F5, \n\naccording to ISRM classification) and that in several boreholes permeabilities higher than \n\n10 LU were obtained along the majority of the boreholes length, at between 7 to 42 m down \n\nfrom their head. In this block, rotary-percussive drilling was used to open drainage boreholes, \n\nwhich prevented the obtaining of samples. \n\nA cross section of the different geomechanical and hydraulic zones established in the \n\nfoundation of block 6-7 (HIDRORUMO 2001) shows that the area tested was that with \n\nweaker geomechanical characteristics and higher permeability.  \n\n4.4.1.3 Variation of discharges and water pressures \n\nVariations in discharges and water pressures recorded in drains and piezometers located in the \n\nfoundation of block 6-7 are shown in Figure 4.26 and Figure 4.27. The first figure shows that \n\nin four of the drains (D2, D3, D5 and D6) discharges reached values higher than 60 l/min, \n\nbefore drains were changed into piezodrains. Variations in water pressures followed patterns \n\nof variations in reservoir level in the majority of piezometers, with a maximum of 1.8 bar. \n\nHigher water pressures were only recorded in piezometer PZ5J-1, located downstream, in the \n\nstilling basin, with the 2 m long piezometric chamber located between elevations 38.4 m and \n\n40.0 m.  \n\nThe available data showed that pressures gauges calibrated from 0 to 2.5 bar and from 0 to 4 \n\nbar with reading intervals of 0.1 bar, and measuring cylinders of sizes between 0.125 and 20 l \n\nshould be used. \n\nWhen borehole water-inflow tests were carried out, the maximum recorded discharge was \n\naround 10 l/min. \n\n \n\n\n\n 123 \n\nR.B.\n\nUPSTREAM VIEW\n\nENLARGED AREA\n\n(m)\n\n  13   12   11   10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2 1\n\n110\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\nPZ11M\n\nPZ10M PZ9M\n\nPZ8M PZ7M PZ6M PZ5M PZ4M PZ3M\n\nL.B.\n\nPZ2M\nPZ1M\n\n \nD\n\n1\nD\n\n2\n\nD\n3\n\nD\n4\n\nD\n5\n\nD\n6\n\nD\n7\n\nD\n1\n\nD\n2\n\nD\n3\n\nD\n4\n\nD\n5\n\nD\n6\n\nD\n7\n\nD\n9\n\nD\n8\n\nD\n1\n0\n\nD\n1\n1\n\nD\n1\n2\n\nD\n1\n3\n\nD\n1\n4\n\nD\n1\n5\n\nD\n1\n6\n\nD\n1\n7\n\nD\n1\n8\n\nD\n1\n9\n\nD\n2\n0\n\nD\n2\n1\n\nD\n2\n3\n\nD\n2\n2\n\nD\n1\n8\n\nD\n1\n9\n\nD\n2\n0\n\nD\n2\n1\n\nD\n2\n2\n\nD\n1\n8\n\nD\n1\n9\n\nD\n2\n0\n\nD\n2\n1\n\nD\n2\n2\n\nD\n1\n\nD\n2\n\nD\n3\n\nD\n4\n\nD\n5\n\nD\n6\n\nD\n7\n\nD\n8\n\nD\n9\n\nD\n1\n0\n\nD\n1\n1\n\nD\n1\n2\n\nD\n1\n3\n\nD\n1\n4\n\nD\n1\n5\n\nD\n1\n6\n\nD\n1\n7\n\nD\n1\n8\n\nD\n1\n9\n\nD\n2\n0\n\nD\n2\n1\n\nD\n2\n2\n\nD\n2\n3\n\nD\n1\n\nD\n2\n\nD\n3\n\nD\n4\n\nD\n5\n\nD\n6\n\nD\n7\n\nUPSTREAM VIEW (ENLARGED AREA)\n\npiezometric borehole\n\ndrainage borehole\n\nKEY:\n\nVIEW FROM ABOVE\n\nPZ5MPZ6M\n\nPZ5MPZ6M\n\n  6  7\n\n  6  7\n\n \n\nFigure 4.25 \u2013 Location of drains and piezometric boreholes in the foundation of block 6-7 and \n\nof block 7-8, close to dam vertical joint 7. \n\n\n\n   124 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n2005-10-31 2005-11-30 2005-12-30 2006-01-29 2006-02-28 2006-03-30 2006-04-29\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\nR\ne\nse\n\nr\nv\n\no\nir\n\n l\ne\nv\n\ne\nl \n\n(m\n)\n\nD1\n\nD2\n\nD3\n\nD4\n\nD5\n\nD6\n\nD7\n\nD8\n\nD9\n\nD10\n\nD11\n\nD12\n\nD13\n\nD14\n\nD15\n\nD16\n\nD17\n\nD18\n\nD19\n\nD20\n\nD21\n\nD22\n\nD23\n\n lev\n\nel\n\n \n\nFigure 4.26 \u2013 Recorded discharges in the foundation of block 6-7. \n\n \n\n0.00\n\n0.35\n\n0.70\n\n1.05\n\n1.40\n\n1.75\n\n2.10\n\n2.45\n\n2.80\n\n3.15\n\n3.50\n\n2005-10-31 2005-11-30 2005-12-30 2006-01-29 2006-02-28 2006-03-30 2006-04-29\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nb\na\n\nr\n)\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\nR\ne\nse\n\nr\nv\n\no\nir\n\n l\ne\nv\n\ne\nl \n\n(m\n)\n\nPZ5MD\n\nPZ5M\n\nPZ5ME\n\nPZ5J-1\n\nPZ5J-2\n\nPZD2\n\nPZD3\n\nPZD4\n\nPZD6\n\nPZD9\n\nPZD12\n\nPZD18\n\nPZD19\n\nPZD20\n\nPZD22\n\nPZD23\n\nPZD1\n\nPZD7\n\nPZD13\n\nPZD21\n\n level\n\n \n\nFigure 4.27 \u2013 Recorded water pressures in piezometers and piezodrains located in the \n\nfoundation of block 6-7. \n\n11 Jan 2006: piezodrains were adjusted \n\nin such a way that the maximum water \n\npressures were about 1.6 bar (slightly \n\nhigher than 50 % of the hydraulic head) \n\nPZ5J-1 \n\n11 Jan 2006 \n\n14 Feb 2006 \n\n14 Feb 2006: more drains were \n\nchanged into piezodrains \n\nD2 \n\nD3 \n\nD20 \n\nD5 \n\n\n\n 125 \n\n4.4.1.4 Stability analysis \n\nA two-dimensional stability analysis was carried out using the limit equilibrium method and \n\ntaking into account the weight of the dam, the reservoir and tailwater loads, the uplift water \n\npressures, and seismic loads. To assess safety against dam base sliding, usual and extreme \n\nloading combinations were used, prescribed in the Portuguese guidelines for dam design \n\n(RSB 2007). This study is presented in chapter 7. Although high flow rates and uplift \n\npressures are recorded, the stability analysis carried out led to the conclusion that the base \n\nsliding stability of block 6-7 is ensured for usual load conditions. For extreme load conditions \n\nstability is not ensured if drains are inoperable.  \n\n4.4.2 Summary of experimental activity \n\nBorehole water-inflow tests were carried out in drain D14 and in piezodrain D18, which was \n\nworking as a piezometer. Due to time constraints tests were not carried out in drain D12 as \n\nhad been planned. Just before tests were carried out, discharge in drain D14 was 11.5 l/min \n\nand water pressure in piezodrain D18 was 1.45 bar, which was about 50 % of the reservoir \n\nhead. When this piezodrain was dismantled, in order to carry out tests, discharge was about \n\n60 l/min. Both boreholes were tested in consecutive sections throughout their lengths. Tests \n\nshould have been carried out with the equipment assembled first as a single and then as a \n\ndouble packer. However, the supplier did not provide, before these first tests were carried out, \n\nthe part which allows equipment to be assembled as a single packer. Therefore, a PVC stopper \n\nhad to be made. This stopper could not take the water pressure, which meant that only a single \n\ntest could be carried out with the single packer. \n\n4.4.3 Tests in drain D14 \n\nBefore testing began, readings were taken in order to know the reservoir level (80.44 m) and \n\ndischarges and water pressures in all the drains, piezodrains and piezometers in the foundation \n\nof block 6-7. These discharges and water pressures were the \u201creference values\u201d. The \u201cblind \n\ndevice\u201d was inserted into D14, which made it possible to remove obstructions at 3.75 m, \n\n5.20 m and 9.02 m down from the gallery floor and to measure the borehole length, which \n\nwas not 26.0 m, as prescribed in the design, but 12.5 m, probably due to wall collapse after \n\ndrilling. The equipment was assembled first as a single packer and, taking into account the \n\nborehole\u2019s length, it was decided that four test intervals would be tested, between the bottom \n\nof the borehole and 11.0, 8.0, 5.0 and 2.0 m down from the drain head. In this way, there \n\nwould be intervals 1.5, 4.5, 7.5 and 10.5 m long. Only the lowest test interval could be tested \n\nwith the single packer. The rest of the borehole was tested with the double packer. \n\n \n\n\n\n   126 \n\nResults are presented with the test divided into 10 steps, shown in Figure 4.28:  \n\nStep 1: reference values (recorded before carrying out tests); \n\nStep 2: test at the lowest test interval (11.0 m \u2013 12.5 m); \n\nStep 3: 8.0 m \u2013 11.0 m test interval; \n\nStep 4: confirm that reference values had been reached; \n\nStep 5: 5.0 m \u2013 8.0 m test interval; \n\nStep 6:  5.0 m \u2013 8.0 m test interval, with the test interval closed; \n\nStep 7: confirm that reference values had been reached; \n\nStep 8: 2.0 m \u2013 5.0 m test interval, with the test interval working as a drain; \n\nStep 9: 2.0 m \u2013 5.0 m test interval, with the test interval closed; \n\nStep 10: confirm that reference values had been reached. \n\nTable 4.2 shows all the measurements taken while carrying out tests. Depths are measured \n\nalong the borehole. Discharges are shown in blue for ease of analysis.  \n\nStep 1 concerns reference values. In step 2, in which the lowest borehole area was tested, \n\ndischarges in and above the test interval were measured over time for 25 minutes and it was \n\nconcluded that discharge stabilization was immediate. In this step, the quantity of water \n\nflowing into the test interval was 8.68 l/min, which was around 75 % of the total discharge. \n\nThe total discharge in the drain being tested was, at this test step, slightly lower than the \n\nreference discharge (11.16 l/min &lt;11.5 l/min), probably due to the fact that the packer was \n\nobstructing a seepage path or to a change in water pressure distribution. At this step, there \n\nwere only changes in drain D11, in which discharge decreased from 0.82 to 0.79 l/min and in \n\npiezometer D13, in which water pressure increased by 0.05 bar. Shortly after taking \n\nmeasurements, the PVC stopper which allowed the equipment to be assembled as a single \n\npacker failed and the equipment fell into the bottom of the borehole. Therefore, it was \n\nimpossible both to close the pipes and to test the remaining test intervals with the single \n\npacker. \n\nIn step 3, with the test interval from 8.0 m to 11.0 m down from the drain head, there was no \n\nwater flowing out of the pipes, and the water level inside the pipes remained 27 cm above the \n\ngallery floor. The water pressure at the test interval was that of the water column weight. \n\nTaking the test interval\u2019s mid-height as reference, the water pressure was: \n\nbarp 49.060cos27.0\n2\n\n0.110.8\n\n8.9\n\n1\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n \n\n(3.1) \n\n\n\n 127 \n\nstep 1        step 2      step 3       step 4       step 5       step 6       step 7       step 8      step 9      step 10\n\n11.0 11.0\n\n8.0 8.0\n\n5.0 5.0\n\n2.0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.28 \u2013 Test steps in borehole D14. \n\n \n          \n\nD 11 \n\n(drain) \n\nD 12 \n\n(piezometer) \n\nD 13 \n\n(piezometer) \n\nPZ5 M D 14  \n\n(drain) \n\nD 15 \n\n(drain) \n\nD 16 \n\n(drain) \n\ndischarge    (l/min) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTest step \n\n \n\nTime \n\nwhen \n\nreadings \n\nbegan \n\n \n\ndischarge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\nwater pressure \n\n(bar) \ntotal test \n\ninterval \n\nabove \n\ntest \n\ninterval \n\nWater \n\npressure \n\nat pipes \n\nhead \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\ndischarge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\nTotal \n\ndischarge \n\n \n\n(l/min) \n\n1.

The change in neighbouring boreholes was \n\nalmost instantaneous, and it was observed that the area of influence along the drainage line \n\nwas 12.5 m long, from borehole D11 to D16. In this third step, D14\u2019s drainage capacity \n\ndecreased significantly. The water flowing into the lowest area of the tested borehole or along \n\ndiscontinuities that crossed the areas where packers\u2019 rubbers met the borehole\u2019s wall was \n\nprevented from flowing out, therefore that water found other seepage paths through the rock \n\n\n\n   128 \n\nmass, increasing discharges and water pressures in all the equipment installed in its area of \n\ninfluence, particularly in borehole D13, in which the water pressure almost doubled. An \n\nincrease in the quantity of water flowing in above the test interval was also observed at values \n\ngreater than in the second step.  \n\nIn step 4 the packer was deflated and new measurements were taken. Discharge in the drain \n\nbeing tested increased by about 0.6 l/min, which can be explained by the clearing of seepage \n\npaths due to the closure of the lowest test interval. With the exception of the water pressure \n\nrecorded in borehole D12, all the equipment showed a slight difference in relation to reference \n\nvalues: in boreholes D11, D12, D13 and PZ5 M, on the right hand side of the borehole when \n\nlooking from upstream, discharges and water pressures were slightly lower, and on the left \n\nhand side discharges in drains D15 and D16 were a little higher. \n\nIn step 5 the quantity of water flowing into the test interval was 9.40 l/min and above the \n\npackers was 0.65 l/min. The only significant change was in D15\u2019s discharge, which increased \n\nby around 33 %, from 4.73 to 6.29 l/min, due to the closure of borehole D14\u2019s lowest area, \n\ninto which a large quantity of water flowed. In the previous step, prior to the isolation of the \n\n5.0 - 8.0 m test interval, the total discharge was 12.1 l/min. In step 2 about 8.7 l/min flowed \n\ninto the borehole in the 11.0 \u2013 12.5 m interval. A discharge of 9.40 l/min in the 5.0 \u2013 8.0 m \n\ntest interval is higher than the total discharge minus the quantity of water flowing into the \n\nlowest part of the borehole, therefore seepage paths changed. In a rock mass there are always \n\nintersections between discontinuities and therefore one way of explaining this step test\u2019s \n\nresults is that when the borehole branch from 11.0 -12.5 m is working as a drain the easiest \n\nflow path is through that branch, i.e. that is the path with the lowest loss of hydraulic head. \n\nHowever, the favoured seepage paths when this branch is closed are those which lead to the \n\narea located 5.0 - 8.0 m down from the drain head. \n\nIn step 6 the 5.0 \u2013 8.0 m test interval was closed and the water pressure at the pipes\u2019 head \n\nstabilized at 0.65 bar after 10 minutes. In the mid-way in the branch being tested the water \n\npressure was 1.045 bar. Discharge flowing in above the packer practically doubled (from 0.65 \n\nto 1.29 l/min) and discharges and water pressures increased in all the equipment located in the \n\nborehole\u2019s area of influence. The most significant increase was in the adjacent drain, D15, in \n\nwhich discharge which had already increased from 4.73 to 6.29 l/min when the test interval \n\nwas isolated increased to 10.1 l/min when the pipes were closed. The water pressure of 1.0 bar \n\nrecorded in borehole D13 would be incoherent if discharge in drain D15 had not increased so \n\nsignificantly. If discharges in neighbouring boreholes had not increased, the water pressure at \n\nD13 would be equal or greater than that recorded in step 3 (1.25 bar). \n\nAfter deflating the packers, in step 7, measurements were almost the same as those recorded \n\nin step 4. In the following step (step 8), with the 2.0 \u2013 5.0 m interval, only 1.93 l/min flowed \n\n\n\n 129 \n\ninto the test interval and discharges and water pressures in all the neighbouring boreholes \n\nincreased. Once again, the most significant discharge increase was in drain D15, from 4.55 to \n\n10.1 l/min. When the pipes were closed, in step 9, the water pressure reached steady state \n\nconditions in only 45 seconds and was around 0.545 bar at mid-way in the test interval. Only \n\na slight increase in discharges and water pressures was recorded in boreholes located in the \n\nvicinity, and the quantity of water flowing in above the packer increased almost four times. In \n\nthe last test step recorded values were close to those recorded in steps 4 and 7. It would have \n\nbeen interesting to withdraw the borehole from the drainage system, by closing it, and to \n\nmeasure the water pressure at its head so as to asses its influence in the surrounding area. This \n\ninfluence, however, is almost shown in step 9. \n\nFigure 4.29 shows some photos taken whilst carrying out tests. \n\nFigure 4.30 and Figure 4.31 show recorded discharges and water pressures in the equipment \n\nin drain\u2019s D14\u2019s area of influence during the tests. It can be seen that the total discharge \n\ndecreases significantly in step 3, when the lowest part of the borehole is closed. In step 5, the \n\nisolation of the 5.0 \u2013 8.0 m test interval has almost no influence on the total discharge because \n\nwater flows into this area. In steps 6, 8 and 9, the decrease is lower than in step 3, due to the \n\nincrease in the quantity of water flowing into drain D15. Discharges in drains D11 and D16 \n\nbarely change during tests. Whenever the total discharge in D14\u2019s area of influence decreases, \n\nthe water pressures in piezometers located in this area increase proportionally. \n\nFigure 4.32 shows the flow of water entering each water-inflow test interval and the \n\naccumulated discharge from the bottom to the borehole head. The drain\u2019s recorded discharge \n\nin normal operating conditions is shown in both graphs: in the first it allows the assessment of \n\ndischarges in each test interval in relation to the drain\u2019s total discharge; in the second it allows \n\nthe comparison between accumulated and total discharge. It is clear that the quantity of water \n\nthat flows into the lowest borehole area also flows into the 5.0 \u2013 8.0 m test interval and thus in \n\nFigure 4.32 b) discharge flowing into the lower section of the borehole is included twice. In \n\nthe same figure it is shown that if this fact is taken into account, by subtracting the quantity of \n\nwater that flows into the drain\u2019s lower section, the accumulated discharge at the drain\u2019s head \n\nis almost the same as the reference discharge. When comparing discharges it has to be taken \n\ninto account that the pipes\u2019 head varies in the different test steps. In order to accurately \n\ncompare discharges, pipes\u2019 head should be at the same level in every test step. In practice, this \n\nwould mean that pipes would have to be cut, which is not feasible. \n\nFigure 4.33 a) shows the volume of water entering the borehole section above the packer. The \n\nsame figure shows the discharge above the test interval when it is closed. Figure 4.33 b) \n\nshows the variation of water pressure along the borehole. The highest water pressure is \n\nrecorded at the 5.0 \u2013 8.0 m test interval and is 1.05 bar.  \n\n\n\n   130 \n\nFrom tests in drain D14 it is concluded that: i) 75 % of drain discharge flows into the drain in \n\nits lowest 1.5 m; ii) the area of influence along the drainage line is around 12.5 m; iii) there \n\nare links through rock mass discontinuities, between the test interval from 5.0 m to 8.0 m and \n\nthe area below; iv) the highest water pressure, of around 1.05 bar, is measured in the \n\n5.0 - 8.0 m test interval. It can also be concluded that this drain is relevant regarding water \n\npressure relief in the foundation of block 6-7 as the exclusion of any borehole branch leads to \n\nan increase in water pressures and discharges in boreholes located in its area of influence. \n\n \n\n  \n\na) equipment assembled as a single packer b) inserting the packer in the borehole \n\n  \n\nc) flow of water into the test interval d) water pressure at the test interval \n\nFigure 4.29 \u2013 Borehole water inflow tests.  \n\n\n\n 131 \n\n0.0\n\n5.0\n\n10.0\n\n15.0\n\n20.0\n\n25.0\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n\nTest step\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n) \n\nD11\n\nD14 (total)\n\nD14  (test interval)\n\nD14 (above test int.)\n\nD15\n\nD16\n\ntotal\n\n \n\nFigure 4.30 \u2013 Discharges in the equipment placed in drain D14\u2019s area of influence during the \n\nwater-inflow tests. \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n\nTest step\n\nP\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n a\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n d\n\nr\na\n\nin\n's\n\n h\ne\na\n\nd\n (\n\nb\na\n\nr\n) \n\n  D12\n\n  D13\n\n  PZ5 M\n\n  D14\n\n \n\nFigure 4.31 \u2013 Water pressures in the equipment placed in drain D14\u2019s area of influence during \n\nthe water-inflow tests. \n\n\n\n   132 \n\na) b) \n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nDischarge (l/min)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n  recorded discharge   reference discharge\n\nrecorded discharge in normal \n\noperating conditions\n\nrecorded discharge\n\n \n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nDischarge (l/min)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n  accumulated discharge\n\n  reference discharge\n\n accumulated discharge taking into account ...\n\nrecorded discharge in normal \n\noperating conditions\n\naccumulated discharge \n\n(5.0 - 8.0 m test interval \n\nlinked to the lowest test \n\ninterval)\n\naccumulated discharge\n\n \n\nFigure 4.32 \u2013 Discharge flowing into each of drain\u2019s D14 test intervals (a) and accumulated \n\ndischarge from the bottom to the head of the borehole (b), compared with the reference \n\ndischarge. \n\na) b) \n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nDischarge (l/min)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n  discharge above the packer\n\n  reference discharge\n\n discharge above the packer with the test interval\n\nclosed\n\nrecorded discharge in normal \n\noperating conditions\n\ndischarge above \n\nthe test interval\n\ndischarge above \n\nthe test interval \n\nwith the test \n\ninterval closed\n\n \n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n\nWater pressure (bar)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n  pressure   reference discharge\n\n \n\nFigure 4.33 \u2013 Discharge coming into the borehole section between the packer and the drain \n\nhead (a) and variation of water pressure along drain D14 (b). \n\n\n\n 133 \n\n4.4.4 Tests in drain D18 \n\nAs with tests in drain D14, the reservoir level (80.36 m) was measured before testing began. \n\nBorehole D18 was working as a piezometer and therefore, to carry out tests, it was necessary \n\nto dismantle it. In order to check its area of influence, discharges and water pressures were \n\nrecorded in all the drains, piezodrains and piezometers in the foundation of block 6-7 and in \n\npart of the foundation of block 7-8, close to joint 7, before and after dismantling the \n\npiezometer. Measurements lead to the conclusion that discharges and water pressures \n\ndecreased in all the equipment located from piezometer PZ5M, in the foundation of block 6-7, \n\nto borehole D3, in the foundation of block 7-8 (Figure 4.25). Therefore, the borehole\u2019s area of \n\ninfluence is around 30 m along the drainage line. Readings taken with the borehole working \n\nas a drain are the \u201creference values\u201d. Reference discharge in borehole D18 is 61.35 l/min. \n\nThe \u201cblind device\u201d was inserted into D18. There was an obstruction at 10.5 m, which was \n\neasily removed. It was found that from 13.5 to 15 m down from the gallery floor the borehole \n\nwalls were very irregular, indicating a very fractured area. The borehole length was 25.5 m. \n\nThe decision was made to start testing with the 20.0 \u2013 23.0 m test interval. The lowest 1.5 m \n\nlong borehole area was not tested, as it was not possible to assemble the equipment as a single \n\npacker. All the measurements taken while carrying out tests are shown in Appendix 1. \n\nIn addition to test step 0, which are readings taken before dismantling the piezometer, 13 step \n\ntests were considered, shown in Figure 4.34: \n\nStep 1: reference values (recorded before carrying out tests, with D18 working as a drain); \n\nStep 2: 20.0 m \u2013 23.0 m test interval; \n\nStep 3: 17.0 m \u2013 20.0 m test interval; \n\nStep 4: 14.0 m \u2013 17.0 m test interval; \n\nStep 5: 11.0 m \u2013 14.0 m test interval; \n\nStep 6: 8.0 m \u2013 11.0 m test interval; \n\nStep 7: 8.0 m \u2013 11.0 m test interval, with the test interval closed; \n\nStep 8: 8.0 m \u2013 11.0 m test interval, with both the test interval and piezodrain D19 closed; \n\nStep 9: 8.0 m \u2013 11.0 m test interval, after re-adjusting piezodrain D19 to its previous \n\nposition and with the test interval working as a drain; \n\nStep 10: 5.0 m \u2013 8.0 m test interval; \n\nStep 11: 5.0 m \u2013 8.0 m test interval, with the test interval closed. \n\nStep 12: confirm that reference values had been reached; \n\nStep 13: 2.0 m \u2013 5.0 m test interval. \n\n\n\n   134 \n\ntest step 1          2          3          4          5          6          7          8          9        10        11         12        13\n\n(D19 closed)\n\n23.0\n\n17.0\n\n8.0\n\n5.0 5.0\n\n2.0\n\n20.0 20.0\n\n14.0\n\n17.0\n\n11.0\n\n14.0\n\n8.0\n\n11.0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.34 \u2013 Test steps in borehole D18. \n\nTest results concerning discharges and water pressures in each test interval are shown in \n\nFigure 4.35 and Figure 4.36. The following paragraphs describe the various steps in detail. \n\nIn the first 5 test steps, water flowing into the areas being tested did not reach the pipes\u2019 head, \n\nthere were only slight changes in the quantity of water flowing in above the test interval and \n\napparently there were no changes in discharges and water pressures in the neighbouring \n\nequipment. The water pressure in each test interval was calculated taking into account the \n\nlength of the water column inside the pipes. In step 2, piezodrain D19, adjacent to the \n\nborehole being tested, was closed and no change in borehole D18\u2019s discharge was recorded. \n\nPiezodrain D19 was re-adjusted to its previous position and it was decided that during tests it \n\nshould only be closed if there were water flowing out of the pipes. In steps 2 to 5 readings \n\nwere only taken in drain D18 because it was thought that as there had been no changes in \n\nreadings in the borehole being tested, there would be no changes in the neighbouring \n\nboreholes.  \n\nIn step 6, when the 8.0 \u2013 11.0 m test interval was closed, there was a sudden change in test \n\nresults: the total discharge in borehole D18 decreased from 55.0 l/min to 38.9 l/min, and the \n\nmost significant part of this discharge (around 95 %) flowed into the test interval being tested. \n\nThis decrease in drain discharge was probably due to the obstruction of one or more \n\ndiscontinuities through which water flowed, as an increase in discharges and water pressures \n\nwas recorded in almost all the neighbouring equipment. When the pipes were closed (step 7), \n\nthe water pressure at the pressure gauge increased quickly and reached steady-state conditions \n\nin only 7 minutes. Discharges and water pressures increased slightly in equipment located in \n\nD18\u2019s area of influence. In the following step (step 8), piezodrain D19 was also closed. \n\nDischarge flowing into borehole D18 at above the test interval increased, as did the water \n\npressure at the test interval and at the piezodrains located in the neighbouring area. Due to \n\ntime constraints, discharges were only measured at drain D18.  \n\n\n\n 135 \n\na) b) \n0.0\n\n2.5\n\n5.0\n\n7.5\n\n10.0\n\n12.5\n\n15.0\n\n17.5\n\n20.0\n\n22.5\n\n25.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\nDischarge (l/min)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n  recorded discharge   reference discharge\n\nrecorded discharge with the \n\nborehole working as a drain\n\nrecorded discharge\n\n \n\n0.0\n\n2.5\n\n5.0\n\n7.5\n\n10.0\n\n12.5\n\n15.0\n\n17.5\n\n20.0\n\n22.5\n\n25.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\nDischarge (l/min)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n  accumulated discharge   reference discharge\n\nrecorded discharge with the \n\nborehole working as a drain\n\naccumulated discharge\n\n \n\nFigure 4.35 \u2013 Discharge flowing into each of borehole\u2019s D18 test intervals (a) and \n\naccumulated discharge from the bottom to the head of the borehole (b), compared with the \n\nreference discharge. \n\na) b) \n0.0\n\n2.5\n\n5.0\n\n7.5\n\n10.0\n\n12.5\n\n15.0\n\n17.5\n\n20.0\n\n22.5\n\n25.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\nDischarge (l/min)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n  discharge at above the packer\n\n  reference discharge\n\n  discharge at above the packer when the test inbterval\n\nis closed\n\nrecorded discharge with the \n\nborehole working as a drain\n\ndischarge above \n\nthe test interval\n\ndischarge above \n\nthe test interval \n\nwith the test \n\ninterval closed\n\n \n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5\n\n10\n\n12.5\n\n15\n\n17.5\n\n20\n\n22.5\n\n25\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n\nWater pressure (bar)\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n  pressure at the pressure gauge\n\n  reference discharge\n\npressure along the borehole taking into account the\n\nweight of the water column at above the packer\n\npressure at the \n\nborehole's head\n\npressure at the \n\nborehole's head \n\nplus that due to \n\nweigth of the \n\nwater column \n\ninside the pipes\n\n \n\nFigure 4.36 \u2013 Discharge coming into the borehole section between the packer and the drain \n\nhead (a) and variation of water pressure along borehole D18 (b). \n\n\n\n   136 \n\nIn step 9, water was allowed to flow out of the pipes and a new attempt was made to re-adjust \n\npiezodrain D19 to its previous position. However, this was extremely difficult and, due to the \n\ndisturbance that any change in adjacent equipment causes, the decision was made not to \n\nchange anything in neighbouring equipment during borehole water-inflow tests. Discharges in \n\nthe drain being tested were almost the same as those recorded in step 8 and therefore it was \n\nthought that the piezodrain was well positioned. No readings were taken in the neighbouring \n\nequipment. The packer was raised 3.0 m and discharges and water pressures in the equipment \n\nlocated in borehole D18\u2019s area of influence were taken with the test interval working as a \n\ndrain and with the pipes closed (step 10). The comparison between readings in steps 6 and 10 \n\nshowed that there was a significant increase in D19\u2019s discharge and a decrease in water \n\npressures. At the same time, discharges recorded in D18 were lower than those recorded in \n\nstep 6. This could either be due to the clearing of discontinuities, as a result of an increase in \n\nseepage velocity, or to the improper re-adjustment of piezodrain D19. Results analysis carried \n\nout afterwards showed that piezodrain D19 had not been properly re-adjusted.  \n\nTests carried out in drain D18 lead to the following conclusions: \n\ni) water flowed into the drain at between 5.0 and 11.0 m down from the drain head; \n\nii) the area of influence along the drainage line was around 30 m; \n\niii) there was water inflow of around 16.0 l/min at between 7.5 and 8.0 m down from \n\nthe drain head; \n\niv) the test intervals 5.0 \u2013 8.0 m and 8.0-11.0 m were linked through conductive \n\ndiscontinuities around the borehole; \n\nFigure 4.35 clearly shows that both test intervals from 5.0 \u2013 8.0 m and 8.0 - 11.0 m were \n\nlinked through conductive discontinuities, as the accumulated discharge from the bottom to \n\nthe borehole head was greater than the reference discharge. As the two test intervals were \n\nlinked, the water pressure should have been the same in both. The slight difference between \n\nrecorded water pressures, of 0.025 bar, was probably a measurement error. \n\nTest results show that borehole D18 is highly efficient at lowering water pressures in the \n\nneighbouring area. However, this decrease in water pressures is achieved with an excessive \n\nincrease in discharges in its area of influence, from around 87 l/min to 137 l/min. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 137 \n\n4.4.5 Main difficulties found whilst carrying out tests \n\nThe double packer used was acquired about a year before these \u201cexperimental\u201d tests were \n\ncarried out and it was necessary to buy and develop a serious of parts without which the tests \n\nwould not have been possible. Despite the great care taken to check the equipment before \n\ntests, some difficulties were still found whilst testing in situ. Firstly, the piece of equipment \n\nprovided by the supplier to hold the steel cable did not fit inside the pipe at the borehole\u2019s \n\nhead. Therefore, it was necessary to modify it and replace the provided steel cable with \n\nanother of lower diameter. Secondly, the supplier did not provide, before these first tests were \n\ncarried out, the part which allows equipment to be assembled as a single packer. Therefore, a \n\nPVC stopper had to be made. However, it could not take the water pressure, which meant that \n\nonly a single test could be carried out. Finally, the recording device for the pressure \n\ntransducer was not working properly, therefore water pressures could not be taken directly \n\nand had to be taken at the boreholes\u2019 head, with pressure gauges. Regarding this latter \n\ndifficulty, it should be stressed that the recording device is linked to the pressure transducer \n\nand it was impossible to check this in the laboratory, as a borehole with water under pressure \n\nwhere the packer could be inflated would be required. \n\n4.4.6 Conclusions drawn from tests carried out in Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam foundation \n\nTests carried out in only two boreholes do not give enough information about seepage in a \n\nfoundation area. However, in this case they made it possible to identify both the depth at \n\nwhich the main seepage paths cross the boreholes and links between neighbouring boreholes. \n\nThe following conclusions could be drawn: \n\ni) the main seepage paths cross the drains at between 5.0 m and 11.0 m down from \n\nthe drain head; \n\nii) steady state seepage is reached relatively quickly, due to the high permeability of \n\nthe rock mass under blocks 6B-7 and 7-7A. \n\niii) the high seepage velocity recorded in the boreholes reveals that the grout curtain \n\nis probably inefficient in this area. \n\niv) both tested boreholes are relevant regarding water pressure relief in the foundation \n\nof block 6-7, but in borehole D18 this decrease in water pressures is achieved with \n\nan excessive increase in discharges in its area of influence  \n\nThese conclusions are consistent with the results of water pressure permeability tests carried \n\nout both before the construction of the dam and when the grout curtain boreholes were drilled. \n\nThe absence of drainage boreholes logs does not allow further analysis.  \n\n\n\n   138 \n\n4.5 Tests carried out in Alqueva dam foundation \n\n4.5.1 Preparation of tests \n\n4.5.1.1 Area where tests were carried out and variation of discharges and water pressures \n\nThe decision was made to carry out tests, in block 17-18, where the highest discharges were \n\nrecorded in the valley bottom. Figure 4.37 shows recorded discharges and water pressures in \n\nthis block\u2019s foundation. Discharges are very low, with the exception of drain D25 D in which \n\ndischarges went up to 3.0 l/min. When the water in the reservoir rose from around 120 to \n\n136 m in only 3 months, one or more discontinuities which cross drain D25 D opened, and \n\nthere was a sudden increase in the drain discharge, from 0.2 to 0.9 l/min. This increase was \n\neven higher when the reservoir level increased from 136 to 148 m. In this case, discharge \n\nincreased almost 4 times. \n\nTests were to be carried out in drain D25 D, PZB 13-2 and PZB 13-3, in order to obtain \n\ninformation along the upstream-downstream direction. Analysis of discharges recorded in the \n\nneighbouring blocks showed that it would also be interesting to carry out tests in drain D26 D, \n\nlocated in block 18-19, and D20 D, in block 16-17.

The reservoir filling causes the dam to rotate towards downstream, \n\nwith the consequent opening of sub-vertical discontinuities upstream from the dam and \n\nincrease in the aperture of the sub-horizontal discontinuities located below the heel of the \n\ndam. As a consequence, the foundation permeability in the area upstream from the dam \n\nincreases. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   140 \n\n4.5.2 Summary of experimental activity \n\nBorehole water-inflow tests in six drain and piezometric boreholes were carried out in three \n\ndifferent weeks with the reservoir at various elevations: the first tests were done from 16-20 \n\nOctober 2006, with the water level around 143.6 m; the second from 19-23 March 2007, with \n\nthe water level around 150.0 m; and the third from 3-7 September 2007, with the water at an \n\nelevation of about 148.0 m. Both the electrical conductivity of water and temperature were \n\nmeasured every 0.5 m along the tested boreholes prior to water-inflow testing, using a \n\nportable conductivity meter with automatic temperature compensation. \n\nIn the first week, tests were conducted in drain D25 D and in piezometer PZB13-2. In order to \n\nobtain information about seepage in the upstream-downstream direction, an attempt was made \n\nto do borehole water-inflow tests in piezometer PZB13-3, installed at the downstream \n\ndrainage gallery, where an uplift water pressure of 0.5 bar was recorded, which was 6.1 % of \n\nthe hydraulic head. However, the low discharge drained by the borehole (0.02 l/min) would \n\nmake borehole water-inflow tests useless. \n\nNew tests were carried out in March 2007, with the reservoir at an elevation 6.4 m higher than \n\nwhen the first tests were performed. The main aim of these new tests was to study seepage in \n\nthe base of blocks 17-18 and 18-19 in more detail and to detect possible seepage changes due \n\nto the raising of the water level in the reservoir. In order to detect these changes, tests should \n\nhave been repeated in drain D25 D. However, the monitoring data led to the conclusion that \n\nbetween the tests carried out in October 2006 and March 2007, the discharge in drain D25 D \n\nand the water pressure recorded with the drain closed were only about 8 % higher (from \n\n2.0 l/min up to 2.18 l/min and from 4.825 bar up to 5.25 bar), thus it was decided not to repeat \n\nthe tests in that drain. In the week before this second group of tests was done, drains D25 D, \n\nD26 D and D27 D, located in the area being studied, were successively closed, recording \n\ndischarges and water pressures before and after closing the drains, in steady state conditions, \n\nin an area assumed to be larger than the boreholes\u2019 area of influence. Tests were conducted in \n\nboreholes D26 D and D27 D, in block 18-19, and D20 D, in block 16-17. Due to time \n\nconstraints, readings during testing in drain D20 D were taken in transient conditions. In order \n\nto obtain more accurate results, new borehole water-inflow tests were carried out in this drain \n\nin September 2007.  \n\nAdditional information to that provided from the borehole water-inflow tests was obtained by \n\ngradually closing drainage boreholes and doing water electrical conductivity and temperature \n\nanalyses: \n\n- On 21 March 2007, during the second round of water-inflow tests, the electrical \n\nconductivity of water was measured along the two boreholes of the GDJD floor \n\n\n\n 141 \n\nwhere the highest discharges are recorded and in the following week, from 26-29 \n\nMarch both drains were closed, in turn, with a pressure gauge at their heads. These \n\ntests aimed to obtaining an indication of the seepage pattern downstream from the \n\ngrout and drainage curtains. \n\n-  From 21-25 May 2007, with the reservoir at around 149.30 m, water electrical \n\nconductivity and temperature analysis tests were done in the majority of the \n\ndrainage boreholes located in the bottom of the valley and in blocks 18-19 and \n\n19-20, on the right bank, in order to obtain information about where each one of \n\nthe boreholes was crossed by seepage paths. From 20-21 November 2007, with the \n\nreservoir at 147.56 m, new tests were carried out in some boreholes. \n\n- From 5-8 May 2008, with the reservoir at around 148.0 m, all the drains located in \n\nblock 17-18 were gradually closed, so as to identify seepage links between \n\nboreholes, to assess the way in which water pressures varied in the foundation of \n\nthe dam block, and to obtain the average water pressure in the block foundation. \n\nSome information about tested boreholes is given in Table 3.1: borehole reference, block \n\nwhere it is installed, length, type of test, date when tests were carried out, water level in the \n\nreservoir at the time of each test, water pressure at the borehole head when the hole is closed \n\nand corresponding percentage of hydraulic head.  \n\nAs tests in Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam foundation have been presented in great detail in the previous \n\nsections, covering different situations, the following sections include a much simpler \n\ndescription of the similar tests done in Alqueva dam foundation followed by presentation and \n\ndiscussion of the results. The situations which are referred to and analysed are those which \n\nstood out as being unusual or different. Measurements taken during testing and both water \n\nelectrical conductivity and temperature profiles are shown in Appendix 1. \n\n4.5.3 Tests in drain D25 D \n\nIn the electrical conductivity and temperature profiles along drain D25 D obtained prior to \n\nwater-inflow testing (Figure 4.39) there is a sudden variation in the electrical conductivity at \n\nbetween 6.0 and 8.5 m down from the drain head and in temperature at between 6.5 and \n\n8.0 m, therefore it was concluded that this was probably the area where water was flowing \n\ninto the borehole. Flow rates and water pressures in each drain and piezometric boreholes \n\ninstalled at the base of blocks 16-17, 17-18 and 18-19 were first recorded. After the readings, \n\ndrain D25 D was closed with a pressure gauge at its head, which allowed the measurement of \n\nthe hydraulic water pressure being released by the drain and the assessment of the drain\u2019s \n\nlength of influence along the drainage line (18 m) comparing discharges and water pressures \n\n\n\n   142 \n\nmeasured in the nearby boreholes before and after closing the drain, in steady state conditions. \n\nThe later opening of the drain and the measurement, over time, of the discharges and water \n\npressures in the boreholes placed in the drain\u2019s area of influence provided information about \n\nthe period of time necessary to reach steady state conditions (around 90 minutes).  \n\n \n\nBorehole \n\nreference \n\nBlock Borehole \n\nlength \n\nTests Test date Water \n\nlevel in \n\nthe \n\nreservoir \n\nWater \n\npressure \n\nwith the \n\ndrain closed \n\nPercentage \n\nof hydraulic \n\nhead \n\n  (m)   (m) (bar) (%) \n\nD25 D GGD 17-18 23.57 Drain closed \n\n \n\n \n\nElectr. cond.   \n\nWater-inflow  \n\n \n\n \n\n16 Oct. 06 \n\n20 Oct. 06 \n\n13 Mar. 07 \n\n 13 Oct. 06 \n\n 16 Oct. 06 \n\n17 Oct. 06 \n\n18 Oct. 06 \n\n143.58 \n\n143.66 \n\n150.08 \n\n143.65 \n\n143.58 \n\n143.60 \n\n143.60 \n\n4.825 \n\n4.450 \n\n5.250 \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n58.6 % \n\n54.0 % \n\n59.1 % \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\nPZB 13-2 GGD 17-18 23.43 Water-inflow 18 Oct. 06 \n\n19 Oct. 06 \n\n143.60 \n\n143.64 \n\n1.3 \n\n- \n\n 15.9 % \n\n- \n\nPZB 13-3 GDJ 17-18 - - 19 Oct. 06 143.64 0.5 6.1 % \n\nD26 D GGD 18-19 26.0 Drain closed \n\nElectr. cond.   \n\nWater-inflow \n\n14 Mar. 07 \n\n19 Mar. 07 \n\n21 Mar. 07 \n\n150.07 \n\n149.99 \n\n149.95 \n\n4.650 \n\n- \n\n- \n\n53.6 % \n\n- \n\n- \n\nD27 D GGD 18-19 23.0 Drain closed \n\nElectr. cond.   \n\nWater-inflow \n\n19 Mar. 07 \n\n20 Mar. 07 \n\n21 Mar. 07 \n\n149.99 \n\n150.01 \n\n149.95 \n\n0.4 \n\n- \n\n- \n\n4.7 % \n\n- \n\n- \n\nD20 D GGD 17-18 22.5 Drain closed \n\nElectr. cond.   \n\nWater-inflow \n\n \n\n21 Mar. 07 \n\n22 Mar. 07 \n\n23 Mar. 07 \n\n3-7 Sep. 07 \n\n149.95 \n\n149.93 \n\n149.93 \n\n148.04 \n\n1.20 \n\n- \n\n- \n\n0.75 \n\n13.6 % \n\n- \n\n- \n\n8.6 % \n\nDGDJM-5D GDJ \n\nfloor upstr. \n\n2.75 Electr. cond. \n\nDrain closed \n\n21 Mar. 07 \n\n27 Mar. 07 \n\n149.95 \n\n149.86 \n\n- \n\n0.125 \n\n- \n\n1.4 % \n\nDGDJI-2D GDJ \n\nhalfway \n\n4.6 Electr. cond. \n\nDrain closed \n\n21 Mar. 07 \n\n29 Mar. 07 \n\n149.95 \n\n149.87 \n\n- \n\n0.275 \n\n- \n\n3.1 % \n\nD25 E  \n\nto  \n\nD32 D  \n\nBlocks in the \n\nvalley bottom \n\nand at the \n\nbase of the \n\nslope on the \n\nright bank \n\nVaried from  Electr. cond. \n\n \n\n21-25 May \n\n07 \n\n20-21 Nov. \n\n07 \n\n149.30 \n\n \n\n147.56 \n\n- \n\n \n\n- \n\n- \n\n \n\n- \n\nD21 D to \n\nD26 D \n\n17-18 and  \n\n18-19 \n\n Drains closed 5-8 May 08 ? 148.0 Varied from \n\n0.275 to 5.6 \n\nVaried from \n\n3.2 to 64.7 % \n\nTable 4.3 \u2013 Information about the boreholes where tests were carried out. \n\n\n\n 143 \n\nTests were carried out from the borehole bottom upwards, first with a single and then with a \n\ndouble packer.

It was also concluded that there were no \n\nseepage paths between the three 3.0 m long test intervals into each water flowed. Results of \n\nwater conductivity analysis along the borehole, which led to the conclusion that water flowed \n\ninto the borehole at between 6.0 m and 8.5 m down from the drain head, are consistent with \n\nthe results of water-inflow tests. \n\nThe water pressure at the various test intervals obtained with both the single and double \n\npacker was compared with the water pressure when the drain was closed and it was concluded \n\nthat, in this case, the highest water pressure, recorded when the 4.0 \u2013 7.0 m test interval was \n\nclosed, extended along the entire length of the borehole. In the single packer test, with the test \n\ninterval at between 4.0 m and the bottom of the borehole, the water pressure was around \n\n3.4 bar, lower than that recorded when the double packer was used at the test interval \n\n4.0-7.0 m. It has been concluded that in both tests the equipment was not in exactly the same \n\nposition and that in the single packer test a seepage path was plugged by the packer. \n\nAt the end of the week in which these first tests were carried out, drain D25 D was closed \n\nagain and a water pressure of 4.45 bar was achieved, which was 54 % of the hydraulic head. \n\nFrom the beginning to the end of the week, the water pressure and corresponding percentage \n\nof hydraulic head decreased in drain D25 D and increased in piezometers PZB 12 and \n\nPZB 14-2. Differences in the recorded pressures were probably due to changes in seepage \n\nconditions induced by closing consecutive sections along drain D25 D. \n\nRotary-percussive drilling was used to open drain D25 D and therefore no borehole log is \n\navailable to analyse in conjunction with water-inflow tests results. \n\n\n\n 145 \n\n4.5.4 Tests in piezometer PZB 13-2 \n\nIn piezometer PZB 13-2, after obtaining \u201creference values\u201d, the purge valve was opened and \n\nclosed which showed that water pressure was recovered in only about 5 minutes. The pressure \n\ngauge was then removed from the top of the borehole and it was kept working as a drain. The \n\ncomparison of discharges and water pressures observed before and after removing the \n\npressure gauge led to the conclusion that the borehole\u2019s length of influence along the drainage \n\nline was about 27 m, and that piezometer PZB 13-3, located in the downstream drainage \n\ngallery was also in the borehole\u2019s area of influence. It was curious to observe that the removal \n\nof the pressure gauge had no influence on the recorded discharges, except in drain D22 D, \n\nadjacent to the borehole being tested, in which a slight discharge reduction was observed. \n\nThe test was carried out with the single packer in successive ascending test intervals, raising \n\nthe packer 3 m each time. It was observed that around 64 % of the reference discharge flowed \n\ninto the 19.0 m \u2013 bottom of the borehole interval. The water pressure recorded when this test \n\ninterval was closed was 2.5 times greater than the reference pressure. While testing the next \n\ninterval, from 16.0 m to the bottom of the borehole, no water was flowing into the test interval \n\nand it was observed that the water which was entering was flowing into the borehole from \n\nabove the packer. It was concluded that the test interval from 16.0 m to 19.0 m was connected \n\nwith the area above 16.0 m, by seepage paths in the surrounding rock mass. To find out the \n\nelevation at which the connection took place, the remaining test intervals were successively \n\nisolated. In all these test steps the water was flowing into the borehole from above the packer. \n\nWhile examining the test results, it was observed that one of the vertical boreholes where \n\ngeophysical tests had been carried out was drilled only about 0.5 m away from the borehole \n\nbeing tested. It was concluded that there were seepage paths linking both boreholes, not only \n\nin the 16.0 m - 19.0 m test interval but also in depths not greater than 0.75 m, probably in the \n\nblock/pavement concrete interface.  \n\nIn this case, the existence of seepage paths linking the piezometric borehole and the borehole \n\ndrilled to perform geophysical tests, which allows water leaks, releases water pressures; \n\ntherefore, contrary to what is observed in D25 D\u2019s test, the maximum water pressure is not \n\nrecorded at the borehole\u2019s head. \n\nIt may be concluded that PZB 13-2 is a useless borehole due to the fact that, regarding the \n\nsafety evaluation of the dam, the information provided by this piezometer is misleading. \n\n4.5.5 Tests in drain D26 D \n\nTests in drain D26 D were carried out straightforwardly in only 7 steps using the single \n\npacker and raising the equipment 1.0 m each time. As the water electrical conductivity and \n\n\n\n   146 \n\ntemperature profiles had shown that water probably entered the borehole at between 3.5 and \n\n5.0 m down from the drain head, the packer was first placed at the depth of 7.0 m, which \n\nsignificantly decreased the time spent doing the test. It was concluded that the borehole\u2019s \n\nlength of influence along the drainage line was about 30 m and that the total discharge flowed \n\ninto the borehole at between 4.0 and 5.0 m down from the drain head. \n\n4.5.6 Tests in drain D27 D \n\nIn this drain, the results of water electrical and temperature analysis were not conclusive and \n\ntherefore the borehole was tested along its whole length. Tests led to the conclusion that the \n\nwater flowing from the drain head entered the borehole at between 1.0 and 7.0 m down from \n\nthe drain head, equally distributed between the two 3.0 m long test intervals (4.0 \u2013 7.0 m and \n\n1.0 \u2013 4.0 m). Whenever the test interval was closed, a water-spout from the gallery floor was \n\nobserved, which shows that water pressures in the borehole being tested were being relieved, \n\nand that this is therefore an effective drain. \n\n4.5.7 Tests in drain D20 D \n\nThe first tests carried out in drain D20 D, in March 2007, were limited by time constraints \n\nwhich meant that readings were taken in transient conditions. Despite this, the tests showed \n\nthat the drain\u2019s length of influence along the drainage line was about 27 m and, as with drain \n\nD25 D and piezometer PZB 13-2, its area of influence extended towards downstream, at least \n\nas far as piezometer PZB 13-3. It was possible to conclude that water flowed into the borehole \n\nat between 4.0 m and 10.0 m down from the drain head and that about half of the quantity of \n\nwater flowed into the borehole at between 4.0 m and 7.0 m. Differences in discharges \n\nrecorded when the single and the double packers were used were probably due to the \n\nequipment not being at exactly the same position. \n\nNew borehole water-inflow tests were carried out in September 2007, which were carefully \n\nconducted allowing the time necessary to reach steady state conditions. Great care was also \n\ntaken with the positioning of the packers inside the borehole. In order to obtain more detailed \n\nresults, a test interval of only 1 m was used. As the first tests had led to the conclusion that the \n\nwater first entered the borehole at between 7.0 m and 10.0 m down from the drain head, the \n\nsingle packer was first placed at a depth of 10.0 m, and it was observed, as expected, that \n\nthere was no water flowing into the test interval. This was also observed in the following test \n\ninterval, when the packer was raised by 1 m. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 147 \n\nTests carried out led to the following conclusions:  \n\ni) water first entered the borehole at between 8.0 m and 9.0 m down from the drain \n\nhead and there was no change in readings taken in adjacent drains when this test \n\ninterval was closed;  \n\nii) the second place where water entered the borehole was at between 5.0 m and 6.0 m \n\ndown from the drain head, and the third at between 4.0 m and 5.0 m; these seepage \n\npaths were linked, but only the discontinuity located at between 4.0 m and 5.0 m \n\ndown from the drain head influenced readings on the downstream piezometer. \n\niii) tests in drain D20 D only induced changes in readings in the adjacent drains \n\n(D19 D and D21 D), in piezometer PZB 14-1, and in piezometer PZB 13-3, \n\nlocated in the downstream drainage gallery. \n\nAt the end of the tests, as it was observed that discontinuities located at between 4.0 m and \n\n6.0 m down from the drain head were linked, it was decided to isolate a test interval which \n\nincluded all these discontinuities. With the equipment available it was not possible to isolate a \n\ntest interval of 2.0 m, therefore, keeping in mind that there was no water flowing into the \n\nborehole at between 6.0 m and 7.0 m down from the drain head, an interval of 3.0 m was \n\nconsidered, from 4.0 m to 7.0 m. \n\n4.5.8 Additional tests \n\n4.5.8.1 Water electrical conductivity analyses \n\nIn May 2007, with the reservoir at around 149.3 m, water electrical conductivity and \n\ntemperature analysis tests were carried out in the majority of the drainage boreholes located in \n\nthe bottom of the valley and in the first two blocks at the base of the slope, on the right bank.  \n\nAnalysis along the boreholes was carried out with readings every 0.5 m. The electrical \n\nconductivity and temperature profiles are shown in Appendix 1. From the simultaneous \n\nanalysis of both graphs it was possible to identify the depth at which seepage paths cross the \n\ndrains, as this occurs at the depths in which there is a sudden variation in either one or both \n\nparameters. In some cases, however, changes in the electrical conductivity profile can be due \n\nto changes in rock mass lithology, and therefore the profiles should be analysed alongside \n\neach borehole log. In most of the electrical conductivity profiles results obtained close to the \n\ndrain bottom are not shown, as, due to the presence of sediments, they are much lower than \n\nthe data obtained at lower depths. The depth at which the concrete/rock mass interface occurs \n\nis shown in gray or green in each graph presented in Appendix 1 (section A1.5), with the \n\n\n\n   148 \n\nexception of those regarding boreholes where rotary-percussive drilling was used because no \n\ninformation is available about the section of the borehole which goes through concrete. \n\nDuring tests it was observed that in the area of the valley bottom close to the left bank there \n\nare a great number of completely or partially clogged boreholes. Analysis of the matter which \n\nobstructs the boreholes showed that it consists mainly of calcite, which almost certainly \n\ncomes from the cement grout, which was placed in greater quantities in the left bank. The \n\nslow seepage velocities increase the time period for which the water is close to cement and \n\nthe right conditions for precipitation are probably found when the water reaches the borehole. \n\nFigure 4.41 shows water electrical conductivity analysis being carried out and the head of one \n\nof the clogged boreholes.  \n\nFigure 4.42 shows where water flows into each borehole in the area tested, detected by both \n\nwater-inflow tests and water electrical conductivity analysis. The accuracy of the latter tests \n\ncan be verified, as in the boreholes where both tests were carried out inflows of water in the \n\nsame areas were identified. Tests led to the conclusion that water flows into the majority of \n\nthe boreholes mostly at shallow depths, in an area close to the concrete/rock mass interface. \n\nMost of the detected inflows of water below the boreholes\u2019 mid-depth are apparently in areas \n\nwhere the boreholes are crossed by faults. These could be due to a vein of different matter \n\ncrossing the borehole. Some of the holes in which this occurs were drilled using rotary-\n\npercussive methods and therefore no log is available, and even from those available, no \n\nfurther information could be obtained. Figure 4.42 also shows that the bottom of almost every \n\nborehole is obstructed, due to the presence of sediment. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.41 \u2013 Inserting the conductivity probe inside the borehole and a clogged borehole.    \n\n \n\n\n\n 149\n\nG\nV\n\n4\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n6\n\n1\n9\n\n1\n7\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n8\n\n1\n5\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n1\n\n9\n\nL\n.B\n\n.\n1\n\nE\n2\n\nE\n3\n\nE\n\n4E\nG\n\nV\n2\n\n5\nE\n\n6\n5\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n1\n\n8\n9\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n9\n\n1\n2\n\n11\n9\n\n8\n7\n\n10\n1\n\n8\n1\n\n7\n16\n\n1\n5\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n3\n\nG\nG\n\nD\n\n2\n5\n\n23\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n20\n\n2\n4\n\n1\nD\n\n2\nD\n\nR\n.B\n\n.\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\nO\nb\n\nst\nru\n\nct\ned\n\nC\no\n\nn\ncr\n\net\ne\n\n1\n5\n\n1\n6\n\n1\n7\n\n1\n8\n\n1\n9\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n0\n\nF\na\n\nu\nlt\n\n1\n5\n\n4\n1\n\n4\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n0\n\n6\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n(m\n)\n\nG\nD\n\nJ\n\nE\nn\n\nla\nrg\n\ned\n a\n\nre\na\n\nE\nn\n\ntr\na\nn\n\nce\n o\n\nf \nw\n\nat\ner\n\n d\net\n\nec\nte\n\nd\n b\n\ny\n:\n\n(c\no\n\nm\np\n\nle\nte\n\nly\n o\n\nr \np\nar\n\nti\nal\n\nly\n)\n\nK\ney\n\n:\n\nb\no\n\nre\nh\no\n\nle\n w\n\nat\ner\n\n-i\nn\nfl\n\no\nw\n\n t\nes\n\nts\n\nw\nat\n\ner\n e\n\nle\nct\n\nri\nca\n\nl \nco\n\nn\nd\n\nu\nct\n\niv\nit\n\ny \nan\n\nal\nys\n\nes\n\n \n\nFigure 4.42 \u2013 Inflow of water into each borehole in the bottom of the valley and in the first \n\ntwo blocks at the base of the slope, on the right bank. \n\n\n\n   150 \n\n4.5.8.2 Tests in drains located in the floor of the downstream drainage gallery branch \n\nexcavated in the rock mass (GDJD) \n\nThe downstream drainage gallery has a branch which extends towards the right bank and is \n\nexcavated into the rock mass. In this area, called GDJD, the gallery has a concrete covering \n\nand is drained with fans of boreholes drilled in the floor, the sidewalls and gallery ceiling, in \n\nsections located 2.5 m apart. A pipe was installed at the heads of the drains which collect the \n\ngreater quantity of water, to allow measurement of discharges and to conduct the water into \n\ngutter pipes (Figure 4.43). \n\nAccording to the geological-geotechnical surface foundation map (EDP 2006) the whole \n\ngallery was excavated in green schist of good geotechnical quality: the rock mass is fresh to \n\nslightly weathered (W1 to W2) and the mean distance between successive rock joints \n\nmeasured along an intersecting straight line varies between moderate to close (F3 to F4) and \n\nwide to moderate (F2 to F3). The rock mass crossed by this gallery shows some thin faults (in \n\nthe order of 2 to 10 cm) and some faults, mainly at the top of the gallery area, where some \n\nleakages were observed (Figure 4.44). \n\nIn order to have an indication of the rock mass seepage pattern downstream from the grout \n\nand drainage curtains, the electrical conductivity of water was measured along the two \n\nboreholes of GDJD floor where the highest discharges were recorded, whose approximate \n\nlocation is shown in Figure 4.44: i) drain DGDJM\u20135D, with a discharge of 0.41 l/min, and \n\nii) drain DGDJI-2D, with a discharge 0.05 l/min. Both drains are located around 14.0 m \n\ndownstream from the drainage curtain. Test results are shown in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.43 \u2013 Top of the extension of the downstream drainage gallery towards the right bank. \n\n\n\n 151 \n\nThe first drain tested, dipping towards upstream, is only 2.75 m long and, according to test \n\nresults, water flows into the borehole at its bottom or about 1.0 m down from the floor \n\nelevation. The second drain tested is vertical, 4.75 m long, and located halfway between \n\ngallery sidewalls. Water probably enters this drain at a depth of 2.3 m. The diameter of these \n\nboreholes is 55 mm, therefore it was not possible to carry out borehole water-inflow tests with \n\nthe available equipment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.44 \u2013 Geological-geotechnical characterization of GDJD\u2019s floor (adapted from EDP \n\n2006), with an approximate location of tested boreholes. \n\nDGDJM-5D \n\nDGDJI-2D \n\nKey: \n\nGreen schist \n\nChlorite schist and phyllite \n\nPhyllite \n\nVeins and patches of quartz and \n\ncarbonates parallel to schistosity \n\nGeologic contact \n\nStrike, dip and aperture of fault \n\nStrike, dip and aperture of joint \n\nSchistosity \n\nGeologic structures \n\nLithology \n\nWater percolation \n\nLocation of leakages \n\n\n\n   152 \n\nIn the following week both drains were closed, in turn, with a pressure gauge at their heads. \n\nWater pressures of 0.15 bar and 0.275 bar were observed, which were 1.4 % and 3.1 % of the \n\nhydraulic head, respectively. Drain DGDJM-5D was kept closed for seventeen hours and \n\nforty five minutes and drain DGDJI-2D was closed during the next day, for about seven and a \n\nhalf hours. In this period of time the reservoir remained at an elevation of 149.9 m. \n\nClosing drain DGDJM\u20135D led to an increase in discharges recorded in six drains located in \n\nthe vicinity of the borehole, and an increase of 0.05 bar in uplift pressures recorded in \n\npiezometers PZB 12 and PZB13-1. Thus, it can be concluded that the water pressure is low \n\nand that the drain is linked to the adjacent drains and to the mentioned piezometers through \n\nrock mass discontinuities. Information about changes in discharges recorded in the drainage \n\ngallery is not available, as discharges were only recorded before the drain was closed. Closing \n\ndrain  DGDJI\u20132D led to a discharge increase in four of the drains located in its vicinity and to \n\nan increase of 0.05 bar in piezometer PZB13-1. Flow rates in drains located in the drainage \n\ngallery before and after closing the drain were not recorded.  \n\n4.5.8.3 Closure of all the drains and piezometers located in block 17-18 \n\nDuring the development of a global hydraulic model of the dam foundation, presented in \n\nchapter 6.6, it was found useful to obtain the average water pressure in the foundation of \n\nblock 17-18 and to know how water pressures vary at the base of the dam block. These tests \n\nwere carried out from 5-8 May 2008 with the reservoir level around 148.0 m, as shown in \n\nTable 4.3. Discharges and water pressures were recorded in normal operating conditions and \n\nthen drains D25 D and D26 D were simultaneously closed. Readings were taken about 21 \n\nhours later, in steady state conditions. Drains D21 D to D24 D were closed afterwards and \n\nreadings were taken again after 21 hours. Measurements are shown in Appendix 1. When both \n\ndrains D25 D and D26 D were closed simultaneously, water pressures of 5.6 and 5.05 bar \n\nwere recorded respectively. Water pressures increased in the surrounding piezometers and \n\ndischarges increased not only in the surrounding drains but also through the leakage from the \n\nfloor of the downstream drainage gallery. The additional closure of drains D21 D to D24 D, \n\ncaused, as expected, further increase in discharges and water pressures in some of the \n\nboreholes. However, the water pressure at drain D25 D remained 5.6 bar, which was 61 % of \n\nthe hydraulic head, and in drains D21 D to D24 D when closed varied from 0.275 to 2.7 bar, \n\nwhich was 3.17 % to 31 % of the hydraulic head. The average percentage of hydraulic head at \n\nthe dam block was around 27 %, but it could be concluded that the high percentage of \n\nhydraulic head recorded at drain D25 D while carrying out borehole water-inflow tests was \n\nlocalised, and therefore of no concern to the stability of the dam. \n\n\n\n 153 \n\n4.5.8.4 Survey of piezometers \n\nA careful survey of piezometers installed in the arch\u2019s central block (block 13-14) and in \n\nblock 8-9, in the valley bottom close to the left bank, was carried out. In piezometers \n\nPZB 17-2 and PZB 17-3, in which a zero pressure had been observed, the pressure gauges for \n\na range of 0 to 10 bar were installed. However, when the purge valve was opened, a small \n\namount of discharge was observed, therefore there must be a water pressure, which is less \n\nthan 0.2 bar, as accuracy of measurement is 0.2 bar in pressure gauges for a range of  0 to \n\n10 bar. In order to make dam monitoring more accurate, these pressure gauges should be \n\nreplaced by others with a range of 0 to 2 bar and accuracy of 0.05 bar. \n\nBlock Piezometer Water pressure \n\n(bar) \nApproximate \n\ndischarge \n(l/min) \n\nWater pressure \n\nrecovery after \n\nclosing the purge \n\nvalve \n\n8-9 \n\n(valley bottom, close \n\nto the left bank) \n\nPZB 22-1 4.4 0.25 fast \n\nPZB 22-2 0.75 0.10 slow \n\nPZB 22-3 0.75 0.20 slow \n\n13-14 \n\n(central cantilever) \n\nPZB 17-1 0.65 0.15 fast \n\nPZB 17-2 0 Very low slow \n\nPZB 17-3 0 Very low slow \n\nTable 4.4 \u2013 Water pressure and discharges measured by piezometers installed in blocks 8-9 \n\nand 13-14. \n\n4.5.9 Conclusions drawn from tests carried out in Alqueva dam foundation \n\nTests carried out in Alqueva dam foundation led to the conclusion that water flows into the \n\nmajority of the boreholes mostly at shallow depths, in an area close to the concrete/rock mass \n\ninterface. From the water-inflow tests carried out in drains and piezometric boreholes located \n\nin blocks 17-18 and 18-19 it was also possible to conclude that, in this area of the rock mass, \n\ndiscontinuities through which water flows link the various boreholes in a relatively large area \n\nwhich extends towards downstream, as could be concluded from tests carried out in the \n\ngallery branch excavated in the rock mass. Conductive discontinuities have a very small \n\naperture, as recorded discharges and water pressures in the borehole\u2019s area of influence only \n\nstabilize after about an hour and a half. \n\nThe plans for the foundation monitoring system usually advise installing piezometers half \n\nway between drains, in order to observe maximum water pressures. In Alqueva dam, a \n\npiezometer was installed in each block, halfway between joints.  Boreholes to carry out \n\ngeophysical tests were also drilled approximately in the middle of each block. Borehole \n\nwater-inflow tests allowed the detection of seepage paths linking piezometric borehole \n\nPZB 13-2 and one of the boreholes where geophysical tests were carried out. The latter \n\nborehole works as an extra drain, located around 0.5 m from the piezometric borehole. \n\n\n\n   154 \n\nTherefore, water pressure measured in piezometer PZB 13-2 is lower than it would be if the \n\nborehole where geophysical tests were carried out had not been drilled. It can be concluded \n\nthat greater care should be taken in the design of the foundation monitoring system.    \n\nFollowing these tests EDIA was requested to close the boreholes where geophysical tests had \n\nbeen carried out. It was suggested that a PVC pipe should be installed at each borehole head, \n\nclosed with a screw-cap. Closing the geophysical borehole located close to piezometer \n\nPZB 13-2 with a pressure gauge at its head would allow confirmation that there is a seepage \n\npath linking the two holes, as the water pressure in both boreholes would be the same. After \n\nconfirming the existence of this seepage path, it would only be necessary to measure water \n\npressures in the piezometers. EDIA closed the boreholes with wooden plugs. \n\nBoth the position and direction of the main discontinuities can be analysed taking a 3D \n\nimprint, with the aid of a thin sheet of soft rubber wrapped around the inflatable element of \n\nthe packer, fitted with special rubber cement. Once the packer is inflated inside the hole, this \n\nsoft rubber cover is able to take 360\u00b0 imprints of the inside wall, which can be examined at \n\nthe surface. Although a roll of rubber sheet was available, it was not used in the tests carried \n\nout within this study as experiments carried out in LNEC\u2019s laboratory led to the conclusion \n\nthat it would be impossible to identify discontinuities with very small apertures, such as those \n\nin the foundation area being studied. \n\n4.6 Summary and conclusions drawn from tests carried out in situ \n\nThe testing programme was undertaken to obtain knowledge of seepage patterns underneath \n\nconcrete dams. From the tests carried out in both Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o and Alqueva dam it was not only \n\npossible to draw some conclusions about the depth at which the seepage paths cross each one \n\nof the tested boreholes, about the distribution of discharges and water pressures along the \n\nboreholes, and about seepage paths linking various boreholes, but also to verify previously \n\ndefined test procedures and detect some faults in the monitoring plan definition. Results \n\nanalysis showed that tests are better carried out with both single and double packers, as the \n\ntwo sets of results provide different and additional information. Test results, analysed in \n\nconjunction with other available information, such as site geological and geotechnical data \n\nand results of water electrical conductivity analyses, are very useful to better define the \n\ncomplex flow system in specific zones of the foundations of operating dams. The \n\nsimultaneous analysis of water pressures and discharges at each test interval can give \n\ninformation about the aperture of the discontinuities through which water flows.  \n\nTests carried out in Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam foundation showed that seepage velocities are very high \n\nand that both boreholes tested were crossed by seepage paths in an area close to the \n\nconcrete/rock mass interface. Both boreholes tested are relevant regarding water pressure \n\n\n\n 155 \n\nrelief but this decrease in water pressures is achieved with a high increase in discharges. On \n\nthe contrary, in Alqueva dam foundation seepage velocity is very low, which leads to \n\nclogging of drilled boreholes and, possibly of the foundation discontinuities. Tests provided \n\nan indication of the seepage pattern, showing that water flows into the majority of the \n\nboreholes in an area close to the concrete/rock mass interface and that the drainage boreholes \n\nare linked through conductive discontinuities in a relatively large area. The high percentage of \n\nhydraulic head recorded in one of the tested drains was localised and therefore not significant \n\nregarding the safety of the dam even if it were closed or clogged. \n\nAs noted throughout this chapter, there are situations in which borehole water-inflow tests \n\ncannot be carried out, for example in boreholes filled with coarse sand or where geodrains \n\nhave been installed.  \n\nGreat attention was paid to detect any test feature which could be improved and slight but \n\neffective changes were gradually introduced. A further improvement would be to introduce an \n\nautomatic data collection system as in fact, during tests, water pressures displayed at the \n\nrecording device were written by hand on test data sheets at pre-established time intervals. \n\nMore detailed and accurate information on variations in water pressures during tests could be \n\neasily obtained via a data logger linked to a laptop.  \n\nWater-inflow test procedures were defined so as to obtain as much information as possible. \n\nHowever, these procedures can be simplified, depending on the information required. In the \n\ntests presented here, time was allowed in each test step to reach steady state conditions. If \n\nonly approximate water pressures and discharges in each test interval were sufficient, readings \n\ncould have been taken in transient conditions, which would significantly decrease the time \n\ntaken to carry out tests. In this way, a large area of the foundation could be analysed in a \n\nrelatively short period of time. Water electrical conductivity analysis proved to be a quick and \n\naccurate way to obtain information about the depth at which seepage paths cross the boreholes \n\nand therefore it can be used to identify these areas in the majority of the Portuguese concrete \n\ndams, in which discharges are usually low. \n\nAlthough some recent methods have shown increasing possibilities to assist with assessment \n\nof seepage conditions, such as infrared imaging and methods which correlate seepage with \n\nmagnetic fields or with subsurface temperature, they are not yet routinely used. The tests \n\npresented in this chapter supplement the usual seepage information available from drains and \n\npiezometers and could in future be used in other dams, as they allow the assessment of \n\nseepage patterns underneath the dam. At a given dam, the use of borehole water-inflow tests \n\nand water electrical conductivity analysis with the reservoir at different levels, will probably \n\nallow the detection of changes in seepage paths due to changes in loads. The knowledge \n\nobtained is relevant regarding the identification of possible failure modes and therefore helps \n\n\n\n   156 \n\nin the development of an appropriate monitoring programme, which indirectly contributes to a \n\ngreater safety assessment of the dam. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 157 \n\n5 Numerical modelling of seepage in concrete dam foundations \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nThe performance and safety assessment of concrete dams, which have their foundations on \n\nrock masses, are based on the analysis of monitoring data and their comparison with \n\nnumerical results. To study the dam foundation hydraulic behaviour and ensure reliable \n\npredictions of total discharges and hydraulic heads it is not only necessary to take into account \n\nthe complexity of the rock mass, but also to model both the grout curtain and the drainage \n\nsystem properly. The grout curtain is usually modelled assuming an area of lower hydraulic \n\nconductivity. The drain can be modelled by its axis, but the choice of mesh size in the vicinity \n\nof the drain must be carefully analysed. Modelling each one of the drains in 3D models of \n\ndam foundations leads to excessively fine meshes, which are very difficult to use. Whenever \n\npossible, 2D models of dam foundation vertical sections are used. In these models, the \n\nmodelling of the drainage curtain is equivalent to a hypothetical trench in the perpendicular \n\ndirection of the section being studied. \n\nAnalysis presented in this chapter is based on the assumption of an equivalent continuum. The \n\nperformance of the FLAC model in hydraulic analysis was first assessed. For this, two simple \n\nflow cases were studied: i) steady state seepage flow towards a single drain through a \n\nconfined aquifer; and ii) steady state seepage flow through a horizontal plane in a dam \n\nfoundation (2D horizontal plane model). For both cases, analysed with FLAC 4.0 (Itasca \n\n2002), the numerical results were compared with analytical solutions, in terms of discharges \n\nand heads. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed with various grids, so as \n\nto study the influence of the mesh size. The representation of the drain by its actual geometry \n\nor, in a simplified manner, by its axis was also examined. Three-dimensional analysis of \n\nseepage was afterwards carried out with 3DEC (Itasca 2003). The performance of both FLAC \n\nand 3DEC codes was compared using the second above-mentioned flow case. Finally, to \n\nassess and check the performance of the code 3DEC in unconfined steady state flow analysis, \n\ni.e. flows bounded above by a phreatic surface, the steady state flow in a homogeneous, \n\nisotropic and continuum media between two reservoirs was numerically analysed. \n\nThe dimensions of Alqueva dam were taken as reference and a 3D numerical model of a \n\nvertical slice of the foundation below the central cantilever was developed. This model was \n\nused to study the influence of drainage, of boundary conditions, of grout curtain permeability, \n\nof model size and of mesh size. The same model was used to compare the results of a 3D \n\nmodel with those obtained both with an equivalent 2D vertical model and with the 2D \n\nhorizontal plane model.   \n\n\n\n   158 \n\n5.2 Validation tests of the codes FLAC and 3DEC \n\n5.2.1 Radial flow to a single well \n\nThe analysis of flow to a single well can often be solved by analytical methods. This analysis \n\nis particularly important as the study to multiple wells and many problems involving \n\ncomplicated boundary conditions can be solved by superposition of solutions for single well \n\nproblems (USACE 1993), using a linear combination of basic solutions, in order to satisfy \n\nboundary conditions. \n\n5.2.1.1 Analytical solution \n\nThe solution of the steady state seepage flow towards a single well through a confined \n\naquifer, in a homogeneous and isotropic media (Figure 5.1), can be obtained by integrating \n\nDarcy\u2019s law or the one-dimensional Laplace equation (Bear 1988; Muskat 1946) and is \n\nwritten as: \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\nr\n\nR\n\nT\n\nQ\nhH ln\n\n2 ?\n \n\n(5.1) \n\nIn the previous equation: \n\nDgkDkT\nwH\n\n???

In Equation 5.1, H = total head at the outer boundary (m); h = total \n\nhead at well (m); Q = constant discharge from well (m\n3\n/s); R = radius of influence, or radius \n\nbeyond which the well has no influence (m); and r = radius of the well (m). \n\n5.2.1.2 Geometry and boundary conditions \n\nThe steady state seepage flow towards a cylindrical drain was numerically analysed. A drain \n\ndiameter of 0.076 m was assumed, which is the usual dimension of the drainage boreholes. \n\nThe radius of influence is 10 m (model boundary is at 10 m from the hole centre), and a layer \n\nof 0.5 m is considered. The hydraulic conductivity is 2.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, the total head at the outer \n\nboundary is 100 m and at the drain is 50 m. The initial hydraulic head of the domain is 50 m. \n\nTaking into account Equation 5.1, the discharge from the drain is 5.6374 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s. \n\n \n\n\n\n 159 \n\nD\n\nh\nH = initial total head\n\nr\n\nR\n\ndrain with constant\ndischarge, Q\n\nsteady state\npiezometric surface\n\nflow lines aquifer\n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Radial flow in a horizontal aquifer confined between impervious strata (artesian \n\nflow) (adapted from USACE 1993). \n\n5.2.1.3 Axisymmetric model \n\nAnalysis was carried out with an axisymmetric model with the axis of symmetry along the \n\naxis of the hole. To study the differences in the results when the diameter of the hole is and is \n\nnot considered, numerical analysis was carried out taking into account the diameter of the \n\nhole (left boundary at x = 0.038 m) or modelling the drain by its axis (diameter null and left \n\nboundary aligned with the hole axis). The model is 10 m wide by 0.5 m high. The axis of the \n\nhole is aligned with the left boundary of the domain, where x = 0 m. \n\nTo evaluate the effect of mesh size in the vicinity of the drain on solution accuracy different \n\ngrids were considered: in the direction of the hole axis (y) grids contain just one row of \n\nelements, with a width of 0.5 m; in the radial direction (x) grids with 10, 31, 50, 75 and 100 \n\nelements are considered, spaced uniformly within the domain or spaced in a way that the \n\nelement size increases according to a geometric ratio between successive element sizes \n\n(FLAC optional ratio keyword). \n\nFigure 5.2 shows some of the meshes used. The numerical values of the discharges in some \n\nnumerical analyses and their difference, in percentage, to the analytical solution are shown in \n\nTable 5.1. For eight of the cases studied, Figure 5.3 shows the piezometric heads in the radial \n\ndirection, obtained by the numerical and analytical approaches.

Difference between numerical discharge and the \n\nanalytical solution with an increase in the number of mesh elements. \n\n5.2.1.4 Results analysis \n\nThe results presented show that: \n\n1. If the diameter of the hole is taken into account, the finer the mesh in the vicinity of \n\nthe drain the better the comparison between FLAC results and the analytical solution \n\n(both in drain discharges and in hydraulic heads). However, accurate results are \n\nobtained if the dimension of the first element near the hole is close to the drain radius \n\n(for example, grid with 31 elements and ratio 1.1). \n\n2. In some of the cases studied the error when the drain is modelled by its axis is smaller \n\nthan when the drain hole is considered (10 elements and ratio 1.2 or 31 elements \n\nspaced uniformly). This difference in the error is due to the fact that, in this model, the \n\nnumerical result converges to the analytical solution by superior values, which means \n\nthat the permeability of the numerical model is greater than the real one. When the \n\ndrain is modelled by its axis and the hole is not considered, the permeability of the \n\ndomain is reduced, so the error of modelling the drain by its axis compensates the \n\nerror of considering a permeability value greater than the real one. \n\n3. If the drain is modelled by its axis, finer meshes in the vicinity of the drain lead to the \n\nsolution of flow towards a drain with an infinitesimal diameter. Figure 5.3 shows that \n\nwhen a grid with 31 elements is considered, the numerical values of piezometric heads \n\nare closer to the analytical values when the elements are spaced uniformly than when a \n\nfiner mesh in the vicinity of the drain is considered (ratio 1.1). In order to determine \n\nthe most suitable dimension of the element close to the drain, a series of numerical \n\nexperiments was carried out that lead to the conclusion that it must be greater than \n\n0.27 m (slightly greater than three times the diameter of the hole). \n\n\n\n 163 \n\nFrom the study carried out the conclusion was drawn that numerical errors occur when the \n\ndimension of the first element close to the drain is less than 0.0001 mm and the analyses are \n\nrun with the single-precision version of FLAC. The double-precision version solves this \n\nproblem. \n\n5.2.1.5 Influence of the radius beyond which the drain has no influence \n\nTo check if a different radius of influence would alter the most suitable dimension of the \n\nelement close to the drain, new numerical analysis was carried out modelling the drain by its \n\naxis and using R = 100 m. In this case, with the same permeability and boundary conditions as \n\nused previously, drain discharge is 3.9892 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s. Table 5.2 shows the numerical \n\ndischarges and the difference, in percentage, to the analytical solution. Table 5.3 summarizes \n\nthe results obtained with the domain divided into 10 and into 31 elements, in which it can be \n\nverified that the most suitable dimension of the first element close to the drain is independent \n\nof the radius of influence.  \n\n5.2.1.6 Influence of the drain diameter \n\nFinally, to check the influence of the drain diameter, new numerical analysis was carried out \n\nmodelling the drain by its axis and using drain diameters 2 and 10 times greater than the usual \n\ndimension of the drainage boreholes (?1 = 0.152 m and ?2 = 0.76 m). In these cases, with \n\nR = 100 m and the permeability and boundary conditions previously used, drain discharge is \n\n4.3741 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s and 5.6374 \u00d7 10\n\n-6\n m\n\n3\n/s, respectively. Table 5.4 and Table 5.5 show, for \n\neach diameter and for meshes with 10 and 31 elements, calculated discharges and their \n\ndifference, in percentage, to the analytical solutions, and Table 5.6 shows the ratio between \n\nthe most suitable dimension of the element close to the drain and the drain diameter. Results \n\nshow that whatever the drain diameter the most suitable dimension is equal to around 3.5 \n\ntimes the drain diameter. In coarser meshes (R = 100 m and ? = 0.152 m) the ratio is slightly \n\nlower, around 3.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   164 \n\n Number \nof \n\nelements \n\nGeometric ratio \nbetween successive \n\nelement sizes in the x \ndirection \n\nDimension of the \nfirst element in \nthe x direction  \n\n(m) \n\nDischarge in \nthe drain  \n\n \n(\u00d7 10\n\n-6\n m\n\n3\n/s) \n\nDifference to the \nanalytical solution (%) \n\n \n(3.98915  \u00d7 10\n\n-6\n m\n\n3\n/s) \n\nD\nr\na\n\nin\n m\n\no\nd\n\ne\nll\n\ne\nd\n\n b\ny\n\n i\nts\n\n a\nx\n\nis\n \n\n10 1.2 3.852 6.0493 51.6 \n\n 1.28 2.591 5.6353 41.3 \n\n 1.6 0.551 4.4666 12.0 \n\n 1.8 0.225 4.0025 0.33 \n\n 1.8065 0.2185 3.9897 0.01 \n\n31 1.0 3.226 5.8204 45.9 \n\n 1.1 0.55 4.3921 10.1 \n\n 1.136 0.2662 3.9916 0.06 \n\n 1.13624 0.2649 3.9891 0.00 \n\n100 1.0 1.0 4.7827 19.9 \n\n 1.02 0.3203 4.0774 2.2 \n\n 1.02265 0.2699 3.9891 0.00 \n\n300 1.0 0.333 4.0974 2.71 \n\n 1.0013 0.2728 3.9930 0.1 \n\n 1.00135 0.2706 3.9890 0.0 \n\nTable 5.2 \u2013 Drain modelled by its axis (R = 100 m).

To study the seepage flow through \n\na horizontal plane in a dam foundation, the dimensions of Alqueva dam were taken into \n\naccount. FLAC results were compared to the analytical solution (Andrade 1982). \n\n\n\n   166 \n\n5.2.2.1 Analytical solution \n\nTo study the seepage flow through the dam foundation a simplified numerical model was used \n\nin which it is assumed that an impervious dam rests on a finite, homogeneous, isotropic and \n\npervious layer (Andrade 1982). In this model the fluid flow is horizontal and takes place from \n\na vertical fissure that comes from the heel of the dam, where the reservoir pressure is \n\nassumed, towards a vertical fissure that comes from the toe of the dam, where the tailwater \n\npressure is applied. It is assumed that both the vertical fissures and the drains reach the rock \n\nfoundation\u2019s impervious base. Water flow obeys Darcy\u2019s law. Figure 5.5 shows the numerical \n\nmodel. \n\nIn this model a portion of the total discharge that flows into the domain from upstream (qu) \n\nflows to the drains (qdrain) and the rest flows towards downstream (qd): \n\nddrainu\nqqq ??

(5.8) \n\nIn Equations 5.5 and 5.7, Pd is the pressure at the drain, usually assumed to be a function of \n\nthe distance from the drain head to the plane in which seepage is being studied. In this case, it \n\nis assumed that the water pressure at the drain head is zero, which is suitable in the majority \n\nof cases as seepage velocity inside the drains is normally low. However, in rock masses with \n\nhigh permeability and dams in which the drains are inappropriate, the water pressure may be \n\nhigher than that given by the drain head. On the contrary, it is also possible that the water \n\ninside the drain does not reach the drain head. Thus, when modelling seepage in the \n\nfoundation of operating dams, the water pressure at the drainage line must be as close as \n\npossible to that monitored. \n\nThis model also enables the study of seepage in an anisotropic media, with different \n\npermeability in the plane of flow and in the perpendicular plane where the drainage system is \n\nlocated, using a different coefficient to correct the permeability in the line of drains. Seepage \n\nvelocity close to and inside the drains, and water pressures, may also be calculated, taking \n\ninto account discharges at the drainage line.  \n\n\n\n   168 \n\n5.2.2.2 Geometry and boundary conditions \n\nThe steady state seepage flow through a horizontal plane in Alqueva dam foundation was \n\nanalysed, at a plane 9.5 m below the dam/foundation interface, which is at level 58.0 m \n\n(Figure 5.6). The drains are assumed to be vertical and, as mentioned in the previous chapter, \n\nhave 25.0 m of length, 0.076 m of diameter and are located 3.0 m apart. The reservoir level is \n\n143.0 m and the tailwater level is 75.0 m. The drain head is at an elevation of 61.0 m. The \n\nhydraulic conductivity is assumed to be 2.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. The base width of the dam is 33.4 m \n\nand the distance between the upstream face and the drainage curtain is 7.5 m. Due to \n\nsymmetry, the numerical model extends from drain centre to a distance half way between \n\ndrains. Given the dimensions listed above, the model is 33.4 m wide by 1.5 m high . \n\nFor this particular problem, taking Figure 5.5 and Equations 5.3 to 5.8 into account, the value \n\nfor Sd is 23.975 m and the values for the discharges, per metre of width of the model, are \n\nqu = 5.642 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s; qdrain = 5.7 \u00d7 10\n\n-6\n m\n\n3\n/s; and qd = -0.058 \u00d7 10\n\n-6\n m\n\n3\n/s (the negative value \n\nmeans that water flows from downstream towards the drain). \n\n \n\n58.00\n\n75.00\n\n143.00\n\nHu\n\nHd\n\n1\n2\n.5\n\n7.5 25.9\n\ndrainage curtain\n\ndrain diameter = 0.076 m;  a = 3.0 m\n\nGDJ\n\nHorizontal plane in which flow is analysed\n\nGGD\n\nGV4\n\nGV3\n\nGV2\n\nGV1\n\n61.00\n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 \u2013 Cross section of Alqueva dam central cantilever (assuming a vertical drainage \n\ncurtain).

The complete mesh has 1500 (100 \u00d7 15) \n\nelements. In the first two mesh details shown in Figure 5.7 the dimension of the elements in \n\nthe vicinity of the drain is, in both directions, about 0.05 m, i.e. slightly greater than the drain \n\nradius. A third mesh was considered in which the x-dimension of the elements close to the \n\ndrain is about 0.027 m. As Figure 5.7 indicates, the meshes have increasing zone size away \n\nfrom the drain. The numerical values of the discharges and their difference, in percentage, to \n\nthe analytical solution are shown in Table 5.7.

The third mesh, in which the drain is modelled by its axis and the \n\ndimension of the elements in the vicinity of the drain is around 0.27 m, leads to the discharges \n\nclosest to the analytical solution. In comparison with the results obtained with the mesh in \n\nwhich the drain is modelled by its diameter, discharges obtained with this third mesh are \n\ncloser to the analytical solution, but the average value of the hydraulic head in the line of \n\ndrains is less accurate. As in the case of seepage flow towards a single drain, modelling the \n\ndrain by its axis is feasible, but the mesh can not be too fine close to the drain. Elements close \n\nto the drain in the mesh shown in Figure 5.7 b) are too small, and therefore results are not \n\naccurate. \n\nNumerical analysis was carried out with a fourth mesh in which the dimension of the elements \n\nin the vicinity of the drain is, in both directions, about 3.5 times the drain diameter and it was \n\nconcluded that the size of the elements in the direction of the drainage line has almost no \n\ninfluence on numerical results. \n\nFigure 5.8 shows that hydraulic heads obtained with the mesh shown in Figure 5.7 c) are very \n\nclose to those obtained with the mesh in which the drain is modelled by its diameter (shown \n\nin Figure 5.7 a)). \n\nIf instead of a drainage curtain with drains with 0.076 m of diameter located 3.0 m apart, there \n\nis a hypothetical continuous trench with the same depth of the drains, the flow into this trench \n\ncan be calculated using Equation 5.4, taking for Sd the value of the hydraulic head at the drain. \n\nFor this problem the value of the discharge at the trench would be 6.56 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n (m\n3\n/s)/m, which \n\nis around 15 % higher than the flow into the drainage line. Therefore, when there is a drainage \n\ncurtain with drains with a diameter of 0.076 m located 3.0 m apart, the quantity of water that \n\nflows into the drains is 87 % (qdrain/qtrench = 0.87) of that which would flow into a trench. If the \n\ndrains are located 6.0 m apart, the total discharge at the drainage line is 9.005 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n (m\n3\n/s)/m. \n\nThe total discharge at the trench would be twice that calculated with drains 3.0 m apart. \n\nTherefore, when the drains are located 6.0 m apart, the quantity of water that flows into the \n\ndrains is 69 % of that which would flow into a trench. \n\nResults here presented show that: \n\n1. If the diameter of the hole is taken into account accurate results are obtained if the \n\ndimensions of the elements adjacent to the drain are close to the drain diameter. \n\n2. For meshes of the same order, the flow into the drain when it is modelled by its axis is \n\n10 % smaller than when the drain is modelled by its diameter. \n\n\n\n   172 \n\n3. Sensitivity studies determined that if the drain is modelled by its axis the dimension of \n\nthe elements in the vicinity of the drain should not be lower than 0.27 m (confirms one \n\nof the conclusions drawn in section 5.2.1). \n\n4. The total discharge at a drainage curtain, with drains with a diameter of 0.076 m \n\nlocated 3.0 m apart, is 87 % of the total discharge at a hypothetical trench with the \n\nsame depth as the drains. This result is particularly important both in \n\nthree-dimensional models, where it is not possible to model each one of the drains, \n\nand in 2D models of vertical cross sections of the dam foundation. \n\n5.2.3 Seepage in a horizontal layer \n\nThe performance of 3DEC and FLAC was compared studying the steady state seepage flow in \n\na horizontal layer of a dam foundation, using the 2D horizontal model of seepage presented in \n\nthe previous section (section 5.2.2). With this model, a series of studies was carried out in \n\nwhich 2D and 3D numerical results, obtained with various meshes, were compared with the \n\nanalytical solution (Andrade 1982). The 3D model is the same size as the 2D model \n\npreviously presented, except for the width, and the same hydraulic properties and loads are \n\nassumed. \n\n5.2.3.1 Influence of mesh size \n\nIn the 3D meshes analysed, with a width of 0.1 m, the domain is divided into three blocks and \n\nthe drain is modelled by its axis. The influence of mesh size was studied with four different \n\nmeshes, successively larger, called m1, m2, m3 and m4. In these meshes, the size of the edges \n\nof the tetrahedral zones increases gradually from the drain and in the radial direction from ec \n\nto ed, in a distance of 7.5 m to both the right and left hand side of the drain. In the remaining \n\ndomain the average size of the tetrahedral edges is fixed, and is assumed to be, in each mesh, \n\nequal to ed. Figure 5.9 shows one of the meshes used in the 2D analysis and the division into \n\nblocks used in the 3D models, along with an internal mesh. \n\nTable 5.8 shows the geometric characteristics of each mesh and the numerical discharges at \n\nthe drain and in both the upstream and downstream boundaries. The same table shows the \n\ncomparison with the analytical solution (as a percentage). Discharges are more accurate when \n\nmesh m2 is used, in which element edges close to the drain are around 20 cm. As meshes m1 \n\nand m2 lead to discharges lower than those obtained with the analytical solution and mesh m3 \n\nto higher discharges, the use of a mesh with ed = 0.4 and ec between 20 and 30 cm allows \n\nbetter results to be obtained. Results presented in Table 5.8 are consistent with the \n\nconclusions drawn so far regarding the representation of the drain: i) as the drain is being \n\n\n\n 173 \n\ndownstream upstream \n\nmodelled by its axis, the mesh must not be too fine close to the drain (as in mesh m1); and \n\nii) for finer meshes it would be necessary to model the drain by its diameter. \n\n \n\na) 2D model \n\n \n\n \n\n  FLAC (Version 4.00)        \n\nLEGEND\n\n   17-Nov-04  13:21\n\n  step    400000\n\nCons.

Discharges obtained with the 3D fine mesh m1 are close to those obtained with the \n\nfine plane mesh in which the drain is modelled by its axis. However, both meshes are \n\ntoo fine and give results that are not close to the solution.   \n\n2. In the 3D model, if the mesh is enlarged and mesh m2 instead of mesh m1 is used, the \n\ndischarge increases, which compensates for the error of not representing the drain by \n\nits diameter. \n\n\n\n   176 \n\n3. As the mesh is further enlarged (meshes m3 and m4) discharges increase and the \n\nhydraulic head along the different lines decreases. It is worth noting, however, that \n\nwith mesh m4 the error is still small (around 5 %). \n\n4. The solutions that lead to discharges closer to the analytical solution and to closer \n\nlines of variation in hydraulic head are obtained with the plane model in which the \n\ndrain is represented by its diameter and with the 3D mesh m2.  \n\n5. Along the different lines it is observed that the model in which the hydraulic heads are \n\nfurther away from the analytical solution, by superior values, is the plane model with \n\nthe drain modelled by its axis. The 3D model with the finer mesh m1, also leads to \n\nhydraulic heads higher than those obtained with the best solutions. It is worth noting \n\nthat the drain is modelled by its axis to allow the use of a coarser mesh, in order to \n\nreduce run times, and therefore the problem of excessive mesh refinement is not likely \n\nto occur. \n\nThe study of steady state flow through a horizontal layer with 3D models leads to basically \n\nthe same conclusions as those obtained in 2D analysis: in 3D models, as in 2D models, the \n\nmost suitable size of the elements in the vicinity of the drain is about three times the drain \n\ndiameter. \n\n5.2.4 Unconfined steady state flow \n\nTo test 3DEC\u2019s formulation for unconfined groundwater steady state flows, i.e. flows \n\nbounded above by a phreatic surface, the problem of flow between two reservoirs through a \n\ncontinuous, homogeneous and isotropic medium was numerically analysed. Water enters and \n\nleaves the pervious medium through vertical boundaries. \n\nIt is very difficult to study flows in which one of the boundary conditions is the phreatic \n\nsurface, not only because it is a nonlinear boundary condition, but also because the position of \n\nthis boundary is, a priori, unknown (Bear 1988). However, to study unconfined flows Dupuit \n\ndeveloped, and published in 1863, a theory based on a number of simplifying assumptions \n\nresulting from the observation that in most groundwater flows the slope of the phreatic \n\nsurface is not very steep. Therefore, Dupuit assumed that in flows in phreatic aquifers: i) the \n\nhydraulic gradient is equal to the slope of the phreatic surface; ii) the flow is essentially \n\nhorizontal; and iii) equipotential surfaces are vertical (Figure 5.13). \n\nWith the simplified assumptions established by Dupuit, it is possible to integrate the \n\ndifferential equation obtained from Darcy\u2019s law. Thus the Dupuit simplification leads to the \n\nspecific discharge expressed by (known as the Dupuit-Forchheimer discharge formula): \n\n\n\n 177 \n\n? ?2\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n\nHH\nL\n\nk\nQ H ??  \n\n(5.9) \n\nwhere Q = discharge per model unit width ((m\n3\n/s)/m); kH = hydraulic conductivity (m/s); \n\nL = distance between the two reservoirs (m); H1 = highest hydraulic head (m); H2 = lowest \n\nhydraulic head (m). \n\nAlthough the shape of the phreatic surface is approximate, the discharge is the exact value \n\n(Bear 1988). \n\nAnalysis done with 3DEC allows the logic for flow inside a block divided into tetrahedral \n\nzones with free surface to be tested. A media with a permeability of 1 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n m/s was \n\nassumed, of which the boundaries are defined by a brick shape 4 m long (x), 2 m high (y) and \n\n0.2 m wide (z), between two reservoirs with hydraulic heads of 2 m and 1 m, respectively. In \n\nthis case, the total discharge is 7.5 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n m\n3\n/s. Meshes were automatically generated in two \n\ndifferent ways: first, irregular meshes, from the average edge length of the tetrahedral-shaped \n\nzones, in which average edge lengths of 0.9 m, 0.4 m and 0.2 m were used; second, regular \n\nmeshes only possible for brick elements, from the number of divisions along each axis, where \n\n1 zone along z axis, 4 zones along y and 8 zones along x or 1 zone along z axis, 8 zones along \n\ny and 16 zones along x were used. In this second case the divisions create brick shape \n\nvolumes which are internally divided into tetrahedra. For both cases numerical discharges \n\nwere compared with the analytical solution. Analysis of Table 5.9 leads to the conclusion that \n\nthe results are quite accurate. The slight difference between numerical discharges and the \n\nanalytical solution are due to approximations involved in the simulation of the free surface. \n\n \n\nz z\n\nx x\n\nobservation well\n\nphreatic surface\n\nequipotentials\n\nP\nqs\n\nsq\n\nh(x)\n\nx\n\nQx\n\nds\n\nq\nx\n\nb\n\nz= h\n\n?\n\n? ?\n\n?\n\n \n\nFigure 5.13 \u2013 The Dupuit assumptions.

Therefore, to study seepage flow in a concrete dam foundation, a \n\n3D model is used in this section, in which both the grout and drainage curtains are simulated. \n\nIn this first phase of analysis, flow is modelled in a foundation slice that extends from \n\nupstream from the dam towards downstream but whose width is only 1.5 m, which is half of \n\nthe distance between drains. The influence of different factors such as drainage, boundary \n\nconditions, grout curtain permeability, model size and mesh size are analysed, and the results \n\nof a 3D model are compared with those obtained with a 2D model, using the same mesh and \n\nthe same numerical code. \n\n5.3.2 Model characteristics \n\nThe dimensions of Alqueva dam were used as reference and two 3D numerical models of part \n\nof the area of the foundation below the central cantilever were developed. A first model, \n\ncalled small model, has a width of around 60 m, a height of 50 m and, taking advantage of \n\nsymmetry, a thickness of 1.5 m. The upper boundary of the model is at the same elevation as \n\nthe dam/foundation interface (58.0 m). It was assumed that the grout curtain, which crosses \n\nthe whole model width, is 1 m thick. The drain is modelled by its axis (diameter zero) and the \n\ndrain is at the model boundary (z = 1.5 m). The model was divided into 8 blocks, internally \n\ndivided into 68019 tetrahedra, with a total of 19330 grid points (Figure 5.15). The mesh is \n\nfiner close to the drain and the relative position of the grout and drainage curtains is respected. \n\nThe mesh was defined by the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones, which increases, \n\nradially and gradually, from 0.4 m to 0.8 m, from the upper point of the drain to the external \n\nboundary. The number of zones across the model\u2019s thickness decreases gradually from 4 to 1 \n\nfrom the drain area to the lower boundary. Figure 5.15 shows the position of the grout curtain \n\nand the drain, of which the depth is about half of the grout curtain\u2019s length and, in the mesh, \n\nends at the horizontal joint. The same figure shows the blocks around the grout and drainage \n\ncurtains, and the mesh which is automatically generated. \n\nThe above-mentioned model was used to develop a second, called large model, adding blocks \n\nupstream, downstream and downwards. This new domain, with 150.0 \u00d7 78.0 \u00d7 1.5 m\n3\n was \n\ndivided into thirteen blocks, internally divided into 189076 tetrahedra, with a total of 49910 \n\ngrid points (Figure 5.16). In these new blocks the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones \n\nis 1.0 m.  \n\n\n\n   180 \n\nIt is assumed that the rock mass foundation is homogeneous and isotropic with a permeability \n\nof 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. The grout curtain dips 20\u00b0 towards upstream, is located about 7.0 m \n\ndownstream from the upstream face and is 41 m long. The drainage curtain is located about \n\n0.5 m downstream from the grout curtain and dips 5\u00b0 towards upstream but it was assumed to \n\nbe vertical, in order to simplify the model. The numerical analyses were carried out assuming \n\nthe reservoir at an elevation of 143.0 m and the water downstream from the dam at an \n\nelevation of 75.0 m. A zero pressure was assumed at the drain head. \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\ndip=   90.00 above\ndd =  180.00\nc enter -2.050E+ 00\n        3.300E+01\n        7.500E-01\nc ut-pl. 0.000E+00\nmag =      2.00  \nc ycle    130000\n\n20-Jul-05  16:33\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\ndip=   90.00 above\ndd =  180.00\ncenter -2.050E+00\n        3.300E+01\n        7.500E-01\ncut-pl. 0.000E+00\nmag =      2.00  \ncycle    100000\n\n18-Feb-05   1:38\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n    \n\n \n\ndrain\n\ngrout\n\ncurtain\n\n \n\nFigure 5.15 \u2013 3D small model.

Therefore, the water entering \n\nthe model from the upstream boundary flows directly towards downstream. Table 5.10 shows \n\nthe numerical discharges for different values of kgrout curtain/krock mass: i) the grout curtain with \n\nthe same permeability as the rock mass (it simulates seepage in a foundation with no grout \n\ncurtain); ii) grout curtain 10 times less pervious than the rock mass; iii) grout curtain 100 \n\ntimes less pervious than the rock mass; and iv) grout curtain 1000 times more impervious than \n\nthe rock mass. The results of a run in which the grout curtain permeability was assumed to be \n\nzero and of another run in which the zones corresponding to the grout curtain were deleted are \n\nalso shown.  \n\nThe main aim of grouting is to reduce discharges and seepage velocity. Results in Table 5.10 \n\nshow that, taking the situation without grout curtain as reference, the quantity of water that \n\nflows through the model decreases by about: \n\n- 9 % if  the grout curtain permeability is 1/10 of that of the rock mass; \n\n- 36 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/100 of that of the rock mass; \n\n- 50 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/1000 of that of the rock mass; \n\n- 53 % if it is assumed that kgrout curtain = 0.0 or if the zones simulating the grout curtain are \n\ndeleted. \n\n \n\nmassrock\n\ncurtaingrout\n\nk\n\nk\n\n \n\nDischarge   \n\n(\u00d7 10-6 m3/s) \n\n1 9.1307 \n\n0.1 8.3203 \n\n0.01 5.8394 \n\n0.001 4.5093 \n\n0 4.2914 \n\nWithout zones in the grout curtain\u2019s area 4.2923 \n\nTable 5.10 \u2013 Foundation with grout curtain but without drainage.

Numerical analysis \n\nshows that with 3DEC it is possible to simulate an impervious grout curtain, without \n\ncomputational problems, not only deleting the zones simulating the grout curtain but also \n\nassuming that its permeability is zero. The small difference between the results obtained in \n\nthese two situations is due to a slight difference in a scaling parameter used by the 3DEC \n\nalgorithm for steady state solutions. \n\nIn the 3DEC explicit algorithm, run time increases when the differences in the permeability of \n\nthe different groups of elements are large, therefore it is not advisable to assume very low \n\nnumbers for the grout curtain permeability. In practice, as it was concluded, a ratio of 1:1000 \n\nis enough. If a more impervious grout curtain is to be assumed, zero permeability should be \n\nconsidered, which avoids the zones simulating the grout curtain being included in seepage \n\nanalysis. \n\n5.3.4 Influence of drainage \n\nThe small model was used to carry out numerical analysis identical to that presented in the \n\nprevious sub-chapter, assuming that the dam foundation not only has a grout curtain but also a \n\ndrainage curtain. The drain is modelled by its axis, and the hydraulic head of the drain\u2019s head \n\nis assumed along the axis. Table 5.11 shows the numerical discharges for different \n\nkgrout curtain/krock mass. \n\nTaking as reference the situation without drainage, the results of which are presented in the \n\nprevious section, it can be seen that the quantity of water flowing into the model increases by \n\naround:  \n\n- 76 % if the grout curtain permeability is the same as the rock mass permeability;  \n\n- 64 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/10 of that of the rock mass; \n\n- 34 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/100 of that of the rock mass; \n\n- 22 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/1000 of that of the rock mass; \n\n- 20 % if it is assumed that the grout curtain is impervious.  \n\nTaking as reference the situation in which no grout curtain is considered, it can be seen that \n\ndrain discharge decreases: \n\n- by around 14.5 % if the grout curtain is 10 times less pervious than the surrounding rock \n\nmass;  \n\n- to about half (decreases 48.3 %) if the grout curtain is 100 times less pervious than the \n\nrock mass;  \n\n\n\n 183 \n\n- by around 62 % to 64 % in the situations where an impervious grout curtain is assumed, \n\nnamely, when it is assumed that the grout curtain is 1000 times less pervious than the \n\nrock mass, kgrout curtain = 0.0, or without zones in the grout curtain area. \n\nAnalysis of discharges flowing into or out of each gridpoint in the upstream and downstream \n\nboundaries and along the drain show that, in this model with both grout and drainage curtains, \n\nthe water enters the domain from the upstream boundary, flows out of the model from the \n\ndrain and, in the downstream boundary, enters the domain above a certain level, and flows out \n\nof the domain below that level. This level varies with kgrout curtain/krock mass: when the grout \n\ncurtain permeability is the same as that of the rock mass, the above-mentioned elevation is \n\n37.0 m; if kgrout curtain/krock mass = 0.1, the elevation is 36.0 m; if kgrout curtain/krock mass = 0.01, the \n\nelevation is 32.5 m; and in the remaining situations, it is 31.0 m. \n\nThe main aim of drainage is to reduce the hydraulic head. Figure 5.17 shows a comparison \n\nbetween the numerical hydraulic heads in a foundation with and without drainage, for \n\ndifferent kgrout curtain/krock mass. The results without drainage correspond to those presented in the \n\nprevious section.

To study the influence of boundary \n\nconditions, a different situation was analysed, still with the small model, in which it is \n\nassumed that the lateral and bottom boundaries are impervious, as well as the dam \n\nconcrete/rock mass interface. In this case, water flows into and out of the domain, with the \n\nexception of the drain, through the rock mass surface, upstream and downstream from the \n\ndam, where the upstream and downstream hydraulic heads are assumed. Seepage close to an \n\nimpervious boundary is parallel to that boundary. Figure 5.18 shows the two above-mentioned \n\nboundary conditions. Table 5.12 shows the numerical discharges in each situation, assuming \n\ndifferent relationships between the grout curtain and rock mass permeability. \n\nTable 5.12 shows that when the lateral and bottom boundaries and the dam/rock mass \n\ninterface are assumed to be impervious (case b) in Figure 5.18), discharges flowing out of the \n\ndrain, when kgrout curtain/krock mass is 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001, are 87 %, 72 % and 66 %, respectively, \n\nof discharges determined when the hydraulic heads are assumed in the vertical boundaries \n\nupstream and downstream from the domain. Percentages of water flowing into the model \n\nfrom upstream, for each the above-mentioned situations are 80 %, 67 % and 59 %, \n\nrespectively.

Discharges for different boundary conditions and different \n\nrelationships between the grout curtain and rock mass permeability. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.20 shows the variations in the hydraulic head along nine 50 m long vertical lines, for \n\neach of the above-mentioned boundary conditions, when the grout curtain permeability is 10 \n\ntimes lower than that of the rock mass. The location of the vertical lines is shown underneath. \n\nFrom the analysis of Figure 5.19 and Figure 5.20 it can be concluded that, when the hydraulic \n\nhead is assumed on the upstream and downstream lateral boundaries, the variation of the \n\nhydraulic head along the vertical lines close to the drain (lines 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) is about 30 m. \n\nThis variation is independent of the grout curtain permeability. Indeed, if it is assumed that \n\nthe grout curtain is 100 or 1000 times less pervious than the rock mass, the hydraulic head \n\nalong the vertical lines is slightly less but the difference between the maximum and minimum \n\ndoes not change. \n\nWhen the lateral and bottom boundaries and the dam/foundation interface are assumed to be \n\nimpervious, the head loss on the upstream boundary is about 54 m and the variation in the \n\nhydraulic head along the vertical lines close to the drain is about 14 m. \n\nWith this small model, the hypothesis of assuming the hydraulic head on the upstream and \n\ndownstream vertical boundaries, as it neglects the head loss in vertical seepage, mainly in the \n\nupstream area, leads to greater discharges at the drains. However, to draw conclusions about \n\nthe vertical seepage, the model should be larger in the upstream area. Moreover, it is not \n\nrealistic to assume that the upper boundary is impervious, as the rock mass surface is \n\npervious. Therefore, to analyse seepage in concrete dam foundations it is adequate to consider \n\nthe hydraulic head on the rock mass surface, upstream and downstream from the dam, and \n\nassume the lateral surfaces, the bottom surface and the dam/foundation interface to be \n\nimpervious. \n\n\n\n 187 \n\n    \n\n \n\nKgrout curtain = 0.1 krock mass  \n\n    \n\n \n\nKgrout curtain = 0.01 krock mass  \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKgrout curtain = 0.001 krock mass Hydraulic \n\nhead (m)    \n\nImpervious upper and bottom  \n\nboundaries \n\n \n\nImpervious lateral and bottom boundaries \n\nand dam/foundation interface \n\nFigure 5.19 \u2013 Hydraulic head contours with two different boundary conditions and different \n\nkgrout curtain/krock mass. \n\n \n\n\n\n   188 \n\n \n\nHd=75.0 mHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\n \n\nPotencial ao longo de linhas verticais com 50m de comprimento\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150\n\nHydraulic head      h (m)\n\nG\nr\no\nu\n\nn\nd\n\n l\ne\nv\ne\nl \n\n(m\n)\n\nline 1\n\nline 2\n\nline 3\n\nline 4\n\nline 5\n\nline 6\n\nline 7\n\nline 8\n\nline 9\n\n \n\n \n\nHd=75.0 mHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\n \n\nPotencial ao longo de linhas verticais com 50m de comprimento\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150\n\nHydraulic head      h (m)\n\nG\nr\no\nu\n\nt \nc\nu\n\nr\nta\n\nin\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nline 1\n\nline 2\n\nline 3\n\nline 4\n\nline 5\n\nline 6\n\nline 7\n\nline 8\n\nline 9\n\n \n\nHu=94.5 m\n\nHdrain=12.5 m\n\nHd=26.5 m\n\n3 1 5\n\n2 4\n\n7\n\n6\n\n89\n\n \n\nFigure 5.20 \u2013 Small model. Variation in hydraulic head along 50 m long vertical lines for the \n\ntwo different boundary conditions (assuming that the grout curtain permeability is 10 times \n\nlower than that of the rock mass). \n\n \n\nLarge model \n\nIn the small model the boundaries are too close to the area of interest, namely the bottom \n\nboundary in relation to the grout curtain. In the large model, boundaries are further away from \n\nthe seepage area of interest. To study the influence of the boundary conditions five cases were \n\ncompared, assuming in all of them that the grout curtain permeability is 100 times lower than \n\n\n\n 189 \n\nthat of the rock mass. The considered boundary conditions are described and represented in \n\nFigure 5.21, together with the hydraulic head contours. The numerical discharges in each of \n\nthe cases studied can be found in Table 5.13.  \n\nThe analysis of Figure 5.21 and of the values presented in Table 5.13 allows the comparison \n\nbetween the different cases: \n\n- From i) and iii) it is possible to conclude that, when it is assumed that water can get \n\ninto and out of the model not only by the rock mass surface but also by the model \n\nvertical boundaries, the discharge coming from the upstream boundary increases by \n\nabout 26 %, the discharge into the drain increases by about 13 % and the discharge \n\nwhich flows out of the model by the downstream boundary is 6 times greater. It is also \n\nevident that the discharge coming out from the downstream boundary is almost the \n\nsame in both cases, thus it can be concluded that part of the discharge coming in from \n\nthe area upstream from the dam flows, in case iii), directly to the vertical boundary \n\ndownstream from the dam.  \n\n- From i) e iv) it is possible to conclude that, in the case being studied, the dimension of \n\nthe downstream pervious boundary has almost no influence on the recorded \n\ndischarges. In both cases, the discharge flowing into the drain is about 95 % of the \n\ndischarge coming into the model from the upstream area.  \n\n- Cases ii) and iii) lead to the conclusion that when the hydraulic head is assumed on the \n\nvertical boundaries, neglecting the vertical hydraulic loss in those areas, the numerical \n\ndischarges are in excess. However, in case ii), in which the entrance of water by the \n\nupper boundary is not allowed, that error is masked and the value of the discharge in \n\nthe drain is close to the value obtained in case i). \n\n- In case v), in which the hydraulic head is assumed only at the drain head and not along \n\nits length, the drainage has almost no influence. \n\nThe study carried out leads to the conclusion that the boundary conditions considered in \n\ncase i), in which the lateral and bottom boundaries as well as the dam/foundation interface are \n\nassumed to be impervious, are the most suitable boundary conditions to study seepage in \n\nconcrete dam foundations. Figure 5.22 shows, for this case, the variation of the hydraulic head \n\nalong 50 m long vertical lines, in three sections of the plane perpendicular to the line of drains \n\nthat crosses the drain.  \n\n\n\n   190 \n\ni) hydraulic head assumed \n\non the rock mass \n\nsurface upstream and \n\ndownstream from the \n\ndam \n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\n \n\n     \nii) hydraulic head assumed \n\non the lateral \n\nboundaries  \n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\n \n\n    \n\niii) hydraulic head \n\nassumed on the lateral \n\nboundaries and on the \n\nrock mass surface, \n\nupstream and \n\ndownstream from the \n\ndam \n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\n \n\n    \niv) hydraulic head \n\nassumed on the rock \n\nmass surface, upstream \n\nand downstream from \n\nthe dam, considering \n\nthe existence of an \n\nimpervious slab \n\ndownstream from the \n\ndam/foundation \n\ninterface  \n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\n \n\n \n\nv) hydraulic head assumed \n\non the lateral \n\nboundaries and on the \n\nrock mass surface, \n\nupstream and \n\ndownstream from the \n\ndam; drain modelled \n\nby a point (at the upper \n\nend)  \n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\n \n\n    \n\nBoundary conditions Hydraulic head contours \n\n \n\nFigure 5.21 \u2013 Schematic representation of boundary conditions and hydraulic head contours \n\nfor Hu = 143.0 m and Hd = 75. 0 m, with kgrout curtain = 0.01 krock mass. \n\n\n\n 191 \n\nBoundary \n\ncondition \n\nDischarge  (\u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\ni) -7.560 7.257 0.191 \n\nii) -8.325 7.180 1.034 \n\niii) -9.514  \n\n(-4.176-5.338)   * \n\n8.162 1.226 \n\n(0.210+1.017)   * \n\niv) -7.559 7.180 0.267 \n\nv) -6.806 \n\n(-2.822-3.984)   * \n\n1.082 5.591 \n\n(3.535+2.057)   * \n\n* The first and second values presented are the discharges crossing the upper horizontal boundary and vertical \n\nboundary respectively (upstream or downstream from the dam). \n\nTable 5.13 \u2013 Numerical discharges for different boundary conditions (see Figure 5.21). \n\n \n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\na b c  \n\n \n\nPotencial ao longo de linhas verticais com 50m de comprimento\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150\n\nHydraulic head  (m)\n\nG\nr\no\nu\n\nn\nd\n\n l\ne\nv\ne\nl \n\n(m\n)\n\na\n\nc\n\nb\n\n \n\nFigure 5.22 \u2013 Variation of the hydraulic head along 50 m long vertical lines assuming that the \n\nlateral and bottom boundaries and the dam/foundation interface are impervious. \n\n5.3.6 Influence of grout curtain permeability \n\nTo assess the influence of grout curtain permeability, the discharges and foundation hydraulic \n\nhead contours with the grout curtain 10, 100, and 1000 times less pervious than the rock mass \n\nwere compared. In practice, the latter is equivalent to simulating an impervious grout curtain. \n\nTable 5.14 shows the numerical values of the discharges and Figure 5.23 shows the hydraulic \n\nhead contours for a grout curtain 10 and 100 times less pervious than the rock mass.  \n\n\n\n   192 \n\nAnalysis of the values presented in Table 5.14 leads to the conclusion that, when comparing \n\nto the case of an impervious grout curtain, the discharges coming into the model from the \n\nupstream area and into the drain increase by about 37 % and 150 % when the grout curtain is \n\n100 times or just 10 times less pervious than the rock mass. Decreasing grout curtain \n\npermeability leads to a significant reduction in the discharges but, as can be seen in Figure \n\n5.23, has little influence on the hydraulic head contours downstream from the grout curtain.  \n\n5.3.7 Influence of model size \n\nMethods based on a domain subdivided into a mesh of zones, such as the distinct element \n\nmethod used in 3DEC, require the model size to be specifically defined, introducing artificial \n\nboundaries. These boundaries should be sufficiently far away from the area being studied, so \n\nthat their location does not have an influence on numerical results.

Numerical discharges when the hydraulic head is \n\nassumed either on the foundation surface upstream and downstream from the dam or on the \n\nlateral boundaries (kgrout curtain/krock mass = 0.01). \n\nWhen the hydraulic head is assumed on the foundation surface, upstream and downstream \n\nfrom the dam, the quantity of water that flows into the model through the upstream boundary \n\nis 42 % greater in the large model than in the small model, and the drain discharge is 30 % \n\ngreater. The small model results are justified not only because they are affected by the small \n\nsize of the upstream pervious boundary but also because the upstream lateral vertical \n\nboundary, which is impervious, is located very close to the grout curtain. The large difference \n\nbetween discharges obtained with the two models reveals that, with these boundary \n\nconditions, the size of the large model is more appropriate. \n\nIn the second situation studied, in which the hydraulic head is assumed on the lateral model \n\nboundaries, upstream and downstream, both the drain discharge and the quantity of water \n\nflowing through the model between the upstream and downstream boundaries at the lower \n\nelevations are higher than they should be (Table 5.15). In the small model, vertical boundaries \n\nupstream and downstream are very close to the dam\u2019s area of influence. Boundary conditions \n\n\n\n   194 \n\nassumed in this second situation are less realistic than assuming the hydraulic head on the \n\nfoundation surface. Analysis of results obtained with both models leads to the conclusion that \n\nthe quantity of water that flows into the model from upstream is only 5 % greater in the large \n\nmodel than that obtained with the small model, and the drain discharge about 8 % lower. \n\nHowever, whilst in the downstream boundary of the small model water flows out of the \n\ndomain for elevations lower than 32.5 m and enters the domain for elevations higher than this, \n\nin the large model water flows out of the model from all the grid points located at the \n\ndownstream boundary. In this situation the size of the large model is also more appropriate. \n\nIt should be mentioned that in analysis carried out with the small model, convergence in \n\nsteady state conditions is achieved in about 10 \u00d7 10\n5\n steps, which takes, in this model, two \n\nand a half hours. In the large model convergence is achieved, in both cases referred to in this \n\nsub-chapter, in about 3 \u00d7 10\n5\n steps, which takes about fifteen hours. \n\n5.3.8 Influence of mesh size \n\nTo assess the influence of the mesh size a second mesh was defined which is similar to the \n\nmesh shown in Figure 5.16 but coarser. In this mesh, the average edge length of the \n\ntetrahedral zones increases, radially and gradually, from 0.75 m to the model width (1.5 m), \n\nfrom the upper point of the drain to the external boundary of the eight central blocks.  In the \n\nremaining blocks the zones average edge length is 1.5 m. This mesh has 37422 tetrahedra \n\nwith 13107 grid points, which are about 20 % of the total elements and 26 % of the grid \n\npoints of the initial model. This second mesh has two tetrahedra across the model thickness in \n\nthe vicinity of the drain and only one in the remaining domain.  \n\nIn both meshes referred to in the previous paragraph, the average dimension of the tetrahedron \n\nedges increases radially and gradually, from the upper point of the drain to the external \n\nboundary of the eight central blocks. The finer mesh has, in the upper area of the drain, four \n\nelements along its width, thus the average dimension of the tetrahedron edges closer to the \n\ndrain is 0.375 m. However, at the elevation of the drain\u2019s lower end, in the area where the \n\nmajority of the flow comes into the drain, the mesh has just two elements along its width. \n\nTherefore, a third mesh was defined, based on the first, which is finer in the vicinity of the \n\ndrain and along the drain whole length. In this third mesh, the average length of the \n\ntetrahedron edges is 30 cm, which is slightly greater than 3.5 times the diameter of the hole. \n\nThis mesh has 20 blocks, 241303 tetrahedra and 61949 grid points.  \n\nThe numerical discharges obtained with each model are presented in Table 5.16, assuming \n\nthat the grout curtain permeability is 100 times lower than the rock mass permeability. It is \n\npossible to conclude that the coarse mesh leads to discharges into the drain just 5.7 % higher \n\nthan the very fine mesh. About 42 % of the drain discharge flows into the drain in its lower \n\n\n\n 195 \n\n5.0 m. The hydraulic head contours obtained with each one of the meshes are almost \n\ncoincident. The differences are due to the fact that the number of elements across the model \n\nthickness is different, at each elevation, in each one of the models. In the very fine mesh, \n\nconvergence in steady state conditions is achieved in about 4.6 \u00d7 10\n5\n steps, which takes about \n\n27.5 hours. With the coarse mesh, convergence is achieved in about 1.32 \u00d7 10\n5\n steps, which \n\ntakes just one hour and a half.  \n\nFrom the study carried out it is possible to conclude that when the coarse mesh is used errors \n\nin discharges and in hydraulic heads are within acceptable limits. The mesh size is not a \n\nconstraint in the present model, which encompasses only a slice of the foundation, but is \n\nparticularly important in a complete foundation model. It may be concluded that in a large 3D \n\nmodel a coarse mesh may be used away from the zone of interest. This is the case in chapter \n\n6, in which a coarse mesh is used away from the drainage area, as shown in Figure 6.19.  \n\n5.3.9 Comparison between the results of 2D and 3D models \n\nTo compare the results of 2D and 3D models, but removing the influence of different meshes \n\nor different codes, a 2D model was simulated with 3DEC, assuming at the line of the drains \n\nthe same hydraulic head across the model thickness (it simulates a hypothetical continuous \n\ntrench at the line of the drains, as in a 2D model). As the same mesh is used in both models, \n\nthe effect of the mesh size is eliminated.  \n\nThe study carried out led to the conclusion that the discharge into the drains in the 3D model \n\nis about 94 % of the total discharge at the trench. Therefore, if drains with a diameter of \n\n0.076 m are located 3.0 m apart, and a zero pressure is assumed at the drain heads in a 2D \n\nmodel, the discharge into the drain is just 6 % greater than the discharge in a 3D model. But if \n\nthe spacing between drains is 6.0 m, the total discharge at the drainage curtain in the 3D \n\nmodel is about 84 % of the total discharge at the trench.  \n\n \n\nModel Discharge  (\u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\nVery fine mesh (finer in the vicinity of the drain, \n\nalong its whole length) \n\n7.5522 7.1602 0.2417 \n\nFine mesh 7.5598 7.2569 0.1910 \n\nCoarse mesh 7.6421 7.5667 0.0377 \n\nTable 5.16 \u2013 Influence of mesh size. Numerical discharges with different meshes. \n\n\n\n   196 \n\nThe 2D simulation was repeated assuming at the trench the average value of the hydraulic \n\nhead at the line of the drains (63.03m).  This value was determined taking into account the \n\nvariation of the average value of the hydraulic head in depth and the area of influence at \n\ndifferent elevations. Table 5.17 shows the numerical values of the discharges with the 3D and \n\n2D models. In the 2D model, two different hypotheses were considered for the value of the \n\nhydraulic head at the line of the drains:  \n\ni) the same as the hydraulic head at the drain head;  \n\nii) the average value of the hydraulic head at the line of the drains. \n\nIt is concluded that if the average value of the hydraulic head at the line of the drains is \n\nassumed at the trench, which is slightly greater than the hydraulic head at the drain head \n\n(Figure 5.24), the total discharge at the trench decreases, approaching values closer to the \n\ndischarges at the drains in a 3D model (only 0.5 % greater). The lines of variation of the \n\nhydraulic head along horizontal lines at different elevations allow the conclusion that 5.0 m \n\naway from the line of the drains the differences in the piezometric heads are less than 1 %. \n\nTherefore, 5.0 m away from the line of the drains the numerical values of the 2D and 3D \n\nmodels are almost the same. It can be concluded that instead of representing each drain, a \n\ncontinuous trench provides good results if the head is properly set. \n\n5.3.10 Comparison between the average hydraulic head at the line of the drains \n\ncalculated with the 3D model and with the 2D horizontal model \n\nTable 5.18 shows the average hydraulic heads at the drainage line, at various elevations, \n\nobtained with the 3D model and with the 2D horizontal model, using the analytical solution \n\nsuggested by Andrade (1982). The results presented were obtained with the assumed most \n\nsuitable boundary conditions, i.e., with the hydraulic head assumed on the rock mass surface \n\nupstream and downstream from the dam, and with the models with the boundary conditions \n\ncloser to the hypothesis of vertical fissures coming from the heel and toe of the dam. \n\n \n\n \n\nModel Discharge  (\u00d7 10\n-6\n\n)     (m\n3\n/s) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\n3 D Hdrain = 61.0 m (elevation of the drain head) -7.560 7.257 0.191 \n\n \n\n2 D \n\nHdrain = 61.0 m (elevation of the drain head) -7.728 7.712 -0.095 \n\nHdrain = 63.03 m (average value of the \n\nhydraulic head at the line of the drains) \n\n-7.584 7.294 0.177 \n\nTable 5.17 \u2013 Numerical discharges with 3D and 2D models. \n\n\n\n 197 \n\n \n\na\n\na\n\nr\n\nCross\n\nPlan\n\ndrainage line\n\nsection\n\nH\n\nH\n\nupstream\n\ndownstream\n\n \n\nFigure 5.24 \u2013 Hydraulic head at the drainage line. \n\n \n\n Average hydraulic head at the drainage line   (m) \n\n 3D Model Analytical \n\nsolution \n\nsuggested \n\nby \n\nAndrade \n\n \n\nElevation \n\n(m) \n\nHm=143,0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 mHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 mHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\na b c\n\n \n\nHm=143,0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 mHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 mHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\na b c\n\n \n\nHm=143,0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 mHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 m\n\nHd=75.0 mHu=143.0 m\nHdrain=61.0 m\n\na b c\n\n \n\n58.0 62.13 62.12 61.98  \n\n \n\n72.47 \n48.5 62.24 62.28 62.15 \n\n47.0 62.28 62.34 62.22 \n\n40.0 63.06 63.28 63.14 \n\n36.0 65.13 65.66 65.45 \n\nTable 5.18 \u2013 Comparison between the average hydraulic head at the line of the drains \n\ncalculated with the 3D model and with the 2D horizontal model. \n\n \n\n \n\nHupstream = height of the reservoir  \n\nHdownstream = height of the tailwater \n\na = spacing between drains \n\nr = drain radius \n\nS = hydraulic head \n\nSd = average value of the hydraulic \n\nhead at the line of the drains \n\na a\n\ndrain drain drain\n\nline of the\n\ndrains' head\n\nS\n\nSd\n\n\n\n   198 \n\nThe 2D horizontal model of seepage through a concrete dam foundation neglects the existence \n\nof the grout curtain, therefore the average hydraulic head at the drainage line is overestimated. \n\nAs in a horizontal section in any plane of the foundation there is a decrease in the hydraulic \n\nhead at the grout curtain area, the upstream hydraulic head assumed in Equation 5.7 must not \n\nbe defined by the reservoir level but by the hydraulic head downstream from the grout curtain. \n\nTo confirm this hypothesis it is not only necessary to have the results of a 2D model of \n\nseepage in a vertical cross section of the foundation, but also to remember that, when using \n\nEquation 5.7, the distance from the drainage line to the grout curtain and not the distance from \n\nthe drainage line to the upstream face of the dam must be considered. \n\nResults obtained with the model which is presented in the next chapter, in section 6.2, lead to \n\nthe conclusion that: \n\n1) at elevation 48.5 m the hydraulic head downstream from the grout curtain is 62.5 m; \n\n2)  with Hu = 62.5 m and a distance from the drainage line to the grout curtain of 3.5 m \n\n(distance in the model at elevation 48.5 m), Sd is 13.3, therefore the average \n\nhydraulic head at the drainage line 61.8 m (13.3 + 48.5); \n\n3) the difference between numerical results is 0.6 % of the difference of hydraulic head \n\nbetween upstream and downstream.  \n\nTable 5.19 shows the results obtained for the remaining considered elevations. The difference \n\nbetween numerical results and those obtained with the analytical solution suggested by \n\nAndrade assuming the hydraulic head downstream from the grout curtain is, with the \n\nexception of elevation 36.0 m, around 1 % of the difference in hydraulic head between \n\nupstream and downstream. At elevation 36.0 m the difference is 3.3 %. \n\nResults obtained confirm the theory that the hydraulic head downstream from the grout \n\ncurtain must be used when determining the average hydraulic head at the line of the drains \n\nwith Andrade\u2019s analytical solution.  \n\nThe 3D model in which the hydraulic head is assumed on the rock mass surface upstream and \n\ndownstream from the dam was run again with a distance between drains of 6.0 m. Results in \n\nTable 5.20 show that at elevation 48.5 m the difference between the hydraulic head \n\ndetermined with the numerical model and with the expression suggested by Andrade is 3.5 % \n\nof the difference in hydraulic head between upstream and downstream.

When the drains are located 6.0 m apart, the hydraulic head downstream \n\nfrom the grout curtain obtained with the 2D model of a vertical cross section of the dam \n\nfoundation no longer corresponds to the average hydraulic head at the perpendicular direction, \n\ntherefore there is a considerable difference between the results obtained with the 3D model \n\nand with the analytical solution. \n\nResults obtained lead to the conclusion that Andrade\u2019s analytical solution, which can be \n\nquickly and easily applied, is very useful to estimate, at the planning stage, the variation in \n\ndischarges at the drainage line when the spacing between drains is changed. \n\n5.4 Conclusions \n\nThe study of dam hydraulic behaviour requires the use of relatively large meshes, where the \n\nmodelling of drainage systems is simplified. From the numerical simulation of two simple \n\nflow cases, the influence of the mesh size and of different ways of modelling the drains was \n\nassessed. Comparisons with analytical solutions showed the good performance of both the \n\nFLAC and 3DEC models. \n\nThe study carried out led to the conclusion that if a drain with a diameter of 0.076 m is \n\nmodelled by its axis the dimension of the elements in the vicinity of the drain should not be \n\nlower than 0.27 m. It is worth noting that the drain is modelled by its axis to allow the use of a \n\ncoarser mesh, in order to reduce run times.  \n\nThe study of the hydraulic behaviour of a concrete dam foundation with 3D models led to the \n\nfollowing main conclusions: \n\n1. In 3D models, as in 2D models, when the drain is modelled by its axis the mesh in the \n\nvicinity of the drain must not be too fine. The most suitable size of the elements in the \n\nvicinity of the drain is about 3.5 times the drain diameter. \n\n2. In the study of the hydraulic behaviour of dam foundations it is adequate to consider \n\nthe hydraulic head on the rock mass surface, upstream and downstream from the dam, \n\nand assume to be impervious the lateral surfaces, the bottom surface and the \n\ndam/foundation interface. \n\n3. Decreasing grout curtain permeability leads to a considerable decrease in the water \n\nflow through the model and in the discharges coming to the drain, but has little \n\ninfluence on the hydraulic head values. \n\n\n\n 201 \n\n4. The artificial boundaries that define the model limits must be far away from the area \n\nof interest, so that its definition has no influence on the results. However it should be \n\nnoted that in 3D models the increase in the model dimensions leads to a great increase \n\nin the number of the system degrees of freedom and, consequently, an increase in run \n\ntimes. \n\n5. In the studied case, the widening of the mesh to another with about 20 % of the \n\nnumber of elements and 26 % of the number of grid points of the initial mesh, has \n\nlittle influence on the value of the discharges into the drains, and reduces run times by \n\nabout 90 %. \n\n6. In a three dimensional model, when there is a drainage curtain with drains with a \n\ndiameter of 76 mm located 3.0 m apart, the total discharge at the drainage curtain is \n\n94 % of the total discharge at the equivalent trench. If the spacing between drains is \n\n6.0 m, the total discharge at the drainage curtain is 84 % of the total discharge. \n\n7. If the drainage curtain is modelled by an hypothetical continuous trench with the same \n\ndepth as the drains where the average value of the hydraulic head at the line of the \n\ndrains is assumed, the total discharge at the trench is almost the same as the total \n\ndischarge in a 3D model, and 5.0 m away from the line of the drains the difference in \n\nthe piezometric heads is less than 1 %.  \n\nThis last conclusion is particularly significant in global 3D models of the foundation where it \n\nis not possible to model each one of the drains. \n\nConclusions drawn from the study presented in this chapter were taken into account whilst \n\ndeveloping each one of the different models presented in the following two chapters. In both, \n\nthe study of dam foundation hydraulic behaviour starts with two-dimensional models, which \n\nare especially useful as they are very simple and can be employed if the dam geometry does \n\nnot vary in the perpendicular direction and if it can be assumed that the flow takes place at the \n\nplane of the model. However, the flow in fractured rock masses is mainly three-dimensional \n\nand in site-specific studies 3D models provide a more realistic approach to the flow \n\nsimulations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   202 \n\n \n\n\n\n 203 \n\n6 Analysis of seepage in Alqueva dam foundation \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\nComprehensive numerical analysis of seepage in Alqueva dam foundation is presented in this \n\nchapter. The study consisted in the development of a series of numerical models, which were \n\nprogressively validated and calibrated against field data. The first to be developed was a \n\nsimplified two-dimensional model of a vertical cross section, based on the hypothesis of an \n\nequivalent continuum medium. Although Alqueva dam is an arch dam, both structural and \n\nvalley shapes and dimensions allow, as an initial approach, the analysis of seepage along a \n\ncross section at the bottom of the valley using a two dimensional model. This model was \n\ndeveloped before carrying out experimental activities and therefore conclusions drawn from \n\nin situ tests reported in chapter 4.5 were not taken into account.  \n\nIn the analysis of the hydraulic behaviour of concrete dam foundations, 2D models of vertical \n\ncross sections are useful, as they are very simple and can be used if the dam geometry is \n\nconsistent along its length and if it is assumed that the flow takes place at the plane of the \n\nmodel. However, to study seepage in more detail three-dimensional models must be used. \n\nTaking into account the conclusions of the previous chapter, two different 3D models of the \n\nfoundation of Alqueva dam were developed: the first was a detailed 3D model of a part of the \n\nfoundation, in which each one of the drains is modelled; the second, a global model, in which \n\nthe drainage system is simulated in a simplified way. The detailed model was developed for \n\nthe analysis of the tests data. Modelling each one of the drains in 3D models of dam \n\nfoundations leads to excessively fine meshes, which are very difficult to use. However, they \n\nare extremely useful in the analysis of seepage in specific areas, which involves relatively \n\nsmall foundation volumes and a low number of drains are modelled. The development of \n\ndetailed models for seepage analysis in two site-specific areas of the foundation is described \n\nand the results are presented and analysed. A parameter study was carried out to identify \n\nwhich of the parameters have the greatest influence on the numerical discharges and hydraulic \n\nheads. \n\nTest results and the knowledge gained with the detailed models were used to develop a much \n\nmore simplified global hydraulic model of the dam foundation, a scale of representation \n\nwhich is significant for safety assessment studies. In this model, the drainage system is \n\nsimulated in a simplified way, by a hypothetical continuous trench with the same depth as the \n\ndrains. Comparisons between numerical discharges, calculated with this global model, and \n\nrecorded discharges led to the conclusion that the apertures of the discontinuities through \n\nwhich water flows vary with changes in reservoir level. Therefore, based on the results of \n\n\n\n   204 \n\nborehole water-inflow tests, presented in chapter 4.5, and on available field data, an attempt \n\nwas made to estimate the correlation between stress and permeability in some areas of the \n\ndam foundation. \n\nIn the last part of the chapter, a numerical study on the significance of readings taken in \n\npiezometers is presented. In a chapter on numerical modelling of seepage in Alqueva dam \n\nfoundation, this section may seem out of place. However, the study was carried out using the \n\ndimensions of Alqueva dam as reference, with a 3D model based on the detailed 3D models \n\ndeveloped for the analysis of the test results. \n\n6.2 Two-dimensional model of a vertical cross section at the bottom of the \nvalley \n\n6.2.1 Model description \n\nThe 2D model presented in this section was developed prior to water-inflow testing, only as a \n\npreliminary approach to the analysis of seepage in the dam foundation at the bottom of the \n\nvalley (Farinha and Lemos 2006). The analysis was carried out with FLAC 4.0 (Itasca 2002). \n\nIn two-dimensional models, the modelling of the drainage curtain is equivalent to a \n\nhypothetical trench in the perpendicular direction of the section being studied. Therefore, the \n\nnumerical value of the discharges in the drains is greater than in reality. \n\nThe model is about 1000 \u00d7 500 m\n2\n and the boundaries are quite a way from the dam\u2019s area of \n\ninfluence, encompassing about 480 m of foundation upstream from the dam, the areas below \n\nthe dam\u2019s central block, the powerhouse slab and the downstream dam-wall, and about 390 m \n\ndownstream from this wall. The model is 500 m deep (Figure 6.1). Although the majority of \n\nthe flow takes place through the foundation discontinuities it is assumed that joint spacing is \n\nsmall compared to the size of the rock mass being studied and that joint orientation is fairly \n\nrandom. Thus, the hydraulic properties of an equivalent continuum are considered. It is \n\nassumed that water flows according to Darcy\u2019s law, in a homogeneous and isotropic media.   \n\nThe mesh was designed to be finer close to the drains and for no zone to have a length more \n\nthan 10 times its width. The mesh is composed of 3596 zones. Both grout curtains, below the \n\ncentral cantilever and below the downstream dam-wall, which are about 44.0 m and 9.0 m \n\ndeep, respectively, are simulated by a band of elements 1 m wide. The drains and piezometers \n\nare modelled at the same position and with the same length as the holes drilled in the \n\nfoundation (Figure 6.2). \n\nThe mesh has three areas with different hydraulic conductivities. Taking into account the \n\nresults of water pressure permeability tests performed in vertical boreholes where geophysical \n\ntests were also carried out, it was first assumed that the hydraulic conductivity was \n\n\n\n 205 \n\n2.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s above elevation 48.0 m and 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s below (Farinha and Lemos 2006; \n\nLNEC 2005b). After more detailed analysis of the test results, which are shown in Table 6.1, \n\nit was assumed that in the foundation of the dam\u2019s central block (block 13-14), the hydraulic \n\nconductivity was 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s above elevation 48.0 m and 0.5 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s below (Farinha et \n\nal. 2006).  It was assumed that the grout curtains\u2019 hydraulic conductivity was 200 times lower \n\nthan the hydraulic conductivity of the foundation\u2019s most pervious area. \n\n6.2.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions and numerical results \n\nFor boundary conditions the following water pressures were assumed: i) corresponding to the \n\nwater heights in the areas in contact with the Alqueva and Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o reservoirs, including the \n\nupstream slope of the insertion of the dam in the foundation; ii) zero at drain heads; \n\niii) corresponding to the distance from the drain head to the considered level, along the \n\ndrainage boreholes. The remaining boundaries are assumed to be impervious. Figure 6.2 \n\nshows a detail of the numerical model below the dam, powerhouse slab and downstream dam \n\nwall. \n\nThe monitoring results on different dates were compared with numerical results (Farinha et al. \n\n2006). Table 6.2 shows the average values of the recorded discharges in the foundation of the \n\ndam\u2019s central blocks and the corresponding numerical results on the date of the second stage \n\nof the water level during the controlled first filling of the reservoir, at elevation 143.0 m (in \n\nwhich the water pressure was 82 % of the water pressure that is going to be reached at the \n\nretention water level) and on the two dates when, up to the end of 2005, the highest levels \n\nupstream and downstream from the dam were reached.  \n\n  FLAC (Version 4.00)        \n\nLEGEND\n\n   13-Dec-05  16:02\n\n  step    200000\n\nCons.

These differences were \n\nassumed to be due to the fact that the same values of permeability were used in the different \n\nnumerical experiments, not taking into account variations in permeability with the state of \n\nstress in the foundation. \n\nFigure 6.3 shows the hydraulic head contours in the foundation considering the water levels \n\nrecorded on 2005.11.29 and Figure 6.4 shows, for the same date, seepage velocity in the \n\nfoundation. The variations in the hydraulic head along the line where the piezometers are \n\npositioned, with the length defined at the design stage at the base of the central cantilever are \n\npresented in Figure 6.5 (PZB 17-1, 2 and 3). It should be noted that piezometric boreholes are \n\nshorter than defined in the design stage, as shown in Figure 4.16. On the date in question, the \n\nhydraulic heads recorded in the foundation of the dam\u2019s central area, in piezometer PZB-2, \n\nvaried from 62.0 m to 74.0 m, with an average value of 67.2 m. The piezometers installed in \n\nAlqueva dam foundation are boreholes closed with a pressure gauge at their heads, and thus \n\nthe hydraulic head is the same along these boreholes. In the 2D model presented, however, in \n\ncontrast to what was done in the 3D models that are presented in the following sections, the \n\nhydraulic head was not constrained to be an unknown constant along each borehole\u2019s length \n\nand so the lines in Figure 6.5 show the variations in piezometric head along the line where the \n\nboreholes are positioned, as if they had not been drilled.  \n\nIt was decided that the grout curtains\u2019 assumed hydraulic conductivity of 200 times lower \n\nthan that of the foundation most pervious area was not appropriate and so new numerical \n\nanalysis was carried out with a hydraulic conductivity 10 and 20 times lower. In the former \n\ncase, to match the observed discharges at the dam for the reservoir higher levels, maintaining \n\nthe ratio between permeability values of the two foundation zones, a rock mass hydraulic \n\nconductivity of 3.7 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s above elevation 48.0 m and 1.85 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s below would be \n\nneeded. In the latter case, a rock mass hydraulic conductivity of 4.5 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s above \n\nelevation 48.0 m and 2.25 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s below would be needed. However, in both cases the \n\nnumerical discharges at the dam-wall are about half of the recorded values.

As the dam is 96.0 m high and the system \n\ndam/powerhouse creates an impervious boundary of about 140 m at the concrete/rock mass \n\ninterface in the upstream-downstream direction, a reference distance L of 140.0 m is assumed. \n\nFigure 6.12 shows the different meshes used. \n\nTables 3.6 and 3.7 show the numerical results with the water level in the reservoir at an \n\nelevation of 152.0 m and the water downstream from the dam at an elevation of 80.0 m, \n\nassuming the foundation to be drained and not drained, respectively. Results analysis leads to \n\nthe following conclusions:  \n\ni) when drained foundations are considered, meshes larger than four times the \n\nreference distance in the horizontal direction and two times in the vertical direction \n\ngive very close results (differences in drain discharges less than 2.5 %); \n\nii) when the foundation is not drained, the quantity of water flowing through the \n\nmodel when the mesh is about 4 and 3 times the reference distance (in the \n\nhorizontal and vertical directions, respectively), is 55 % of that obtained with a \n\nmodel with a size of about 14 and 7 times the reference distance. \n\nTherefore, when most of the water flows between the reservoir and the drainage curtain it is \n\nenough to consider distances from the dam area to boundaries of about those considered in \n\nmodel m2. When there is a significant quantity of water reaching the downstream boundaries, \n\nthe model boundaries should be further away from the dam\u2019s area. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   214 \n\nModel Length in relation to the  \n\nreference distance L \n\nMesh \n\n \n\nm1 \n\n \n\nhorizontal direction ? 3 L \n\nvertical direction  ? 0,9 L \n\n \n\n  FLAC (Version 4.00)        \n\nLEGEND\n\n   21-May-07  18:16\n\n  step    100000\n\nCons.

Numerical discharges and comparison with \n\nthe discharge obtained with the model which has the furthest boundaries \n\n6.3 Detailed three-dimensional model of a local area \n\n6.3.1 Model description \n\nA detailed three-dimensional model was developed to carry out more in-depth analysis in \n\nspecific areas of the foundation. The model is formed by a series of adjacent vertical strips, \n\nwhich extend from about 50.0 m upstream from the upstream face of the dam to 50.0 m \n\ndownstream from the downstream dam-wall. The model, which can be limited to a specific \n\narea, is formed by a group of strips with two different widths: the inner strips are 3.0 m wide, \n\nthe distance between drains, and, due to symmetry, the outer strips are 1.5 m wide, \n\ncorresponding to half the distance between drains. Each strip has a vertical length of 78.0 m, \n\nwhich is around two times the projection of the grout curtain in the vertical direction. The \n\ncross section of the dam in the valley bottom, from the upstream face of the dam to the \n\ndownstream face of the downstream dam-wall, measures from around 115 m, in the lateral \n\nareas, to around 140 m, in the central cross section, thus the average value of 130.0 m was \n\n\n\n   216 \n\nassumed. The model of a single strip has a volume of 230.0 \u00d7 78.0 \u00d7 3.0 m\n3\n or \n\n230.0 \u00d7 78.0 \u00d7 1.5 m\n3\n. The modelling of each strip takes into account both the horizontal and \n\nvertical curvatures of the dam where it meets the foundation. Each one of these strips is \n\ndivided into blocks, which are internally divided into tetrahedra. \n\nFigure 6.13 shows the position of the foundation model in the area where the bottom of the \n\nvalley meets the right hand side abutment. This model includes three drains and is formed by \n\ntwo inner strips 3.0 m wide and two outer strips 1.5 m wide, thus being only 9.0 m wide. \n\nIt is assumed that the grout curtain, which crosses the whole model width, is 1 m thick. The \n\ndrain is modelled by its axis (diameter zero) and is positioned at the inner strip boundary, in \n\nstrips 1.5 m wide, and at both strip boundaries, in strips 3.0 m wide. Each one of the 1.5 m \n\nwide strips is divided into 25 blocks, and each of the 3.0 m wide strips into 27 blocks, the \n\ndifference being in the number of blocks in the vicinity of the drains, in the drainage curtain \n\ndirection. \n\nThe relative position of the grout and drainage curtains is respected. The grout curtain dips \n\n20\u00b0 towards upstream, is located about 7.0 m downstream from the upstream face and is 41 m \n\nlong. The drainage curtain is located about 0.5 m downstream from the grout curtain and dips \n\n5\u00b0 towards upstream but it was assumed to be vertical, in order to simplify the model.  \n\nThe mesh is finer close to the drains and along the drains\u2019 whole length and was defined by \n\nthe average edge length of the tetrahedral zones. For the 1.5 m wide strips a different number \n\nof zones was assumed in different locations: 4 zones across strips\u2019 width in the vicinity of the \n\ndrains; 2 zones in the blocks surrounding the area in the vicinity of the drains; and only 1 zone \n\nin the remaining domain. The average dimension of the tetrahedron edges closer to the drain \n\nis 0.30 m. Each strip has 127386 tetrahedra and 37695 grid points. In the 3.0 m wide strips the \n\nnumber of zones across the width doubles. Figure 6.14 shows the division into blocks and \n\ninternal mesh of a 1.5 m wide strip, as well as the position of the grout curtain and the drain, \n\nof which the depth is about half of the grout curtain\u2019s length and, in the mesh, ends 3 m above \n\nthe horizontal joint. \n\nThe main weakness of this model is the assumption that, in the area being studied, water flow \n\ntakes place in the upstream-downstream direction, parallel to the main river channel.  \n\nIn order to simplify the definition of different areas\u2019 material properties, rock mass and grout \n\ncurtain were defined as separate regions. The blocks adjacent to the reservoir and to the \n\ndownstream area, where the tailwater pressure is assumed, were also defined as different \n\nregions, to make it easier to define hydraulic boundary conditions. Figure 6.15 shows the \n\nmodel\u2019s four different regions. \n\n\n\n 217 \n\nIn the analysis presented in this section it is assumed that the rock mass foundation is \n\nhomogeneous and isotropic with a permeability of 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s and that the grout curtain is \n\n100 times less pervious. As noted before, such a low ratio between the permeability of the \n\ngrout curtain and that of the rock mass is not considered appropriate. This is modified in the \n\nfollowing section.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.13 \u2013 Position of the foundation model 9.0 m wide in the area where the bottom of the \n\nvalley meets the right hand side abutment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDownstream view \n\nView from above \n\nRight bank Left bank \n\n\n\n   218 \n\n \n\n \n\ngrout curtain drain \nupstream downstream \n\nupstream downstream\n\ngrout curtain drain\n\n \n\nFigure 6.14 \u2013 Face in the upstream-downstream direction of the three-dimensional model of \n\nthe foundation.

The concrete/rock mass \n\ninterface and the bottom and lateral boundaries were assumed to be impervious. A zero \n\npressure was assumed at the drains\u2019 head. \n\nSeepage analysis was first carried out using a single strip 1.5 m wide, in an area of the \n\nfoundation with a width corresponding to half the distance between drains. With this model, \n\nthe numerical discharges are (the negative value means that water flows into the model):  \n\nQ upstream = - 8.0149 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s;  \n\nQ drain = 7.7368 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s; \n\n \n\nfixed hydraulic head\n\nimpermeable\n\n\n\n 219 \n\nQ downstream = 0.2380 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s.  \n\nThe quantity of water flowing into and out of the model is respectively: \n\nQ into the model = 8.0928 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s; \n\nQ out of the model = 8.0183 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s;   \n\nand the maximum unbalanced nodal flux, at the block nodes, is 1.6058 \u00d7 10\n-11\n\n m\n3\n/s. The \n\nreason why the quantity of water flowing into and out of the model does not sum up is \n\nexplained in section 6.3.4.  \n\nThe hydraulic head contours are presented in Figure 6.16 . \n\n6.3.3 Influence of mesh size \n\nIn order to reduce run times, two other meshes were defined which are similar to the fine \n\nmesh shown in Figure 6.14 but with larger elements. In the second mesh, called coarse mesh, \n\nthe average edge length of the tetrahedral zones close to the drain remains 0.30 m but it \n\ndoubles in the other blocks. The third mesh, called very coarse mesh, differs in the average \n\nedge length of the zones close to the drain, which is 0.60 m.  The second mesh has 27012 \n\ntetrahedra with 10297 grid points, which are about 21 % of the total elements and 27 % of the \n\ngrid points of the initial model and the third mesh has 21947 tetrahedra with 8394 grid points, \n\nwhich are about 17 % of the total elements and 22 % of the grid points of the initial model. \n\nFigure 6.17 shows mesh details at the drain\u2019s upper and lower areas for both fine and very \n\ncoarse meshes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.16 \u2013 Hydraulic head contours for Hu = 143.0 m and Hd = 75.0 m, with \n\nkgrout curtain = 0.01 krock mass. \n\nHydraulic head (m) \n\n\n\n   220 \n\nThe numerical discharges obtained with each model are presented in Table 6.6. It is possible \n\nto conclude that drain discharges using the coarse and very coarse mesh are just 1.8 % and \n\n3.4 % respectively greater than those obtained with the fine mesh. \n\nIn the fine mesh, convergence in steady state conditions is achieved in about 3.0 \u00d7 10\n5\n steps, \n\nwhich takes about 8 and a quarter hours. With the coarse mesh, convergence is achieved in \n\nabout 1.5 \u00d7 10\n5\n steps, which takes 54 minutes and with the very coarse mesh in about \n\n1.0 \u00d7 10\n5\n steps, which takes just 30 minutes. Run times presented (Table 6.7) were obtained in \n\nnumerical analyses conducted with a single strip 1.5 m wide. If the model includes more \n\nstrips, run times increase accordingly. \n\nVariations in hydraulic head along horizontal lines 40 m long in various sections of two \n\nplanes perpendicular to the line of drains were compared. The first plane crosses the drain and \n\nthe other is 1.5 m away from the drain, midway between drains. Five horizontal lines were \n\nconsidered in each plane, positioned at the top, the middle and the bottom of the drain, and \n\n1 m and 5 m below the bottom of the drain. Comparison of results obtained with the fine and \n\nthe very coarse mesh (Figure 6.18) led to the conclusion that with the exception of the areas \n\ninside the grout curtain and around the drain, differences in hydraulic head along the lines are \n\nless than 2.6 %. Inside the grout curtain, differences reach about 17 % (because the very \n\ncoarse mesh has only one element across the grout curtain\u2019s thickness, while the fine mesh \n\nhas two), but in the vicinity of the drain, differences in the hydraulic head are less than 4 %.  \n\nIn the case studied, the widening of initial mesh elements to create another with about 17 % of \n\nthe number of elements and 22 % of the number of grid points, has little influence on the \n\nvalue of the discharges and on the hydraulic heads, and reduces run times by about 90 %. \n\nTherefore, the very coarse mesh, shown in Figure 6.17 and in Figure 6.19, was used in the \n\nsubsequent analyses. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 221 \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\ndip=   39.00 above\ndd =  267.00\ncenter -7.228E+01\n        5.856E+01\n        1.729E+00\ncut-pl. 0.000E+00\nmag =    128.00  \ncycle   1000000\n\n 6-Mar-07   7:06\n\nLNEC - DB                         \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\ndip=   39.00 above\ndd =  267.00\ncenter -7.024E+01\n        5.584E+01\n        1.836E+00\ncut-pl. 0.000E+00\nmag =    128.00  \ncycle    500000\n\n 6-Mar-07  10:29\n\nLNEC - DB                         \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =  270.00\ncenter -7.500E+01\n        3.359E+01\n        1.586E+00\ncut-pl. 0.000E+00\nmag =     64.00  \ncycle   1000000\n\n 6-Mar-07   7:06\n\nLNEC - DB                         \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =  270.00\ncenter -7.500E+01\n        3.359E+01\n        1.586E+00\ncut-pl. 0.000E+00\nmag =     64.00  \ncycle    500000\n\n 6-Mar-07  10:29\n\nLNEC - DB                         \n\nFine mesh Very coarse mesh \n\n \n\n3m \n\ndrain drain \n\ndrain \n\nbottom \n\ngrout  \n\ncurtain \ngrout  \n\ncurtain \n\n \n\nFigure 6.17 \u2013 Fine mesh and very coarse mesh: details at the drain\u2019s upper and lower areas. \n\n \n\n \n\nModel \n\nDischarge \n\n(\u00d7 10\n-6\n\n)    (m\n3\n/s) \n\nWater flowing \n\ninto the model \n\nWater flowing \n\nout of the model \n\nUnbalanced \n\nflow \n\n upstream drain downstream (\u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n3\n/s) (\u00d7 10\n\n-6\n m\n\n3\n/s) (\u00d7 10\n\n-11\n m\n\n3\n/s) \n\nFine mesh - 8.0149 7.7368 0.2380 8.0928 8.0183 1.6058 \n\nCoarse mesh - 8.0382 7.8760 0.2271 8.1948 8.1658 2.1721 \n\nVery coarse mesh - 8.1177 8.0025 0.1929 8.2760 8.2479 2.2151 \n\nTable 6.6 \u2013 Influence of mesh size.

This version is useful in models \n\nwhere critical information is lost because of the dimension of the models, such as fluid flow \n\nmodels where more than 1,000,000 cycles may be executed, but requires three times the \n\namount of memory required by the single-precision version (Itasca 2003). To confirm that the \n\ndifference between inflow and outflow values was due to the use of the single-precision \n\nversion, numerical experiments were carried out with the double-precision version. Table 6.8 \n\nshows a comparison of the numerical value of the discharges with both versions.  \n\nAnalysis of results shows that when the double-precision version is used the quantity of flow \n\ninto and out of the blocks is almost the same. The single-precision code is rounded off to six \n\ndecimal places. The value of the unbalanced flow is around 10\n-11\n\n, therefore, in practice, the \n\nnumerical value of the discharge is not altered in each step (it is like adding zero). In the \n\ndouble-precision version, rounded off to 20 decimal places, the solution converges and the \n\nvalue of the out-of-balance flow is around 10\n-19\n\n. Differences in numerical discharges obtained \n\nwith single and double-precision versions are less than 0.4 % and run times are significantly \n\nless when single-precision is used (Table 6.9), because of the smaller number of steps \n\nnecessary to reach convergence. Therefore single-precision was used in subsequent numerical \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 223 \n\nMallha apertada\n\n60.0\n\n70.0\n\n80.0\n\n90.0\n\n100.0\n\n110.0\n\n120.0\n\n130.0\n\n140.0\n\n150.0\n\n-20.0-15.0-10.0-5.00.05.010.015.020.0\n\nMesh coordinate along lines 40.0 m long perpendicular to the line of drains (m)\n\nH\ny\n\nd\nr\na\n\nu\nli\n\nc\n h\n\ne\na\n\nd\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n (5)\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n (5)\n\n Diferen\u00e7a em % entre os valores da malha apertada e os valores da malha muito larga\n\n-20.0\n\n-15.0\n\n-10.0\n\n-5.0\n\n0.0\n\n5.0\n\n10.0\n\n-20.0-15.0-10.0-5.00.05.010.015.020.0\n\nMesh coordinate along lines 40.0 m long perpendicular to the line of drains (m)\n\nD\nif\n\nfe\nr\ne\nn\n\nc\ne\n i\n\nn\n h\n\ny\nd\n\nr\na\n\nu\nli\n\nc\n h\n\ne\na\n\nd\n (\n\n%\n)  (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n (5)\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n (5)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.18 \u2013 Hydraulic head (fine mesh) and differences in percentage in hydraulic head \n\n(fine mesh and very coarse mesh) along horizontal lines 40 m long at various elevations. \n\n \n\n Plane perpendicular to the line of drains, crossing the drain  \n\n Plane perpendicular to the line of drains midway between \n\ndrains \n\n(1) Top of the drain \n\n(2) Middle of the drain \n\n(3) Bottom of the drain \n\n(4) 1 m below the bottom of the drain \n\n(5) 5 m below the bottom of the drain \n\n \n\ndrain \n\n* point inside the grout curtain \n\n*  \n\n*  \n\n*  \n\n*  \n*  \n\n*  *  \n\n*  \n*  \n\n*  \n\n\n\n   224 \n\nupstream downstream\n\ngrout curtain drain\n\n \n\nFigure 6.19 - 3D model of the foundation of Alqueva dam.

Figure 6.20 shows where water flows into each \n\nborehole located in the vicinity of drains D20 D and D25 D, identified with both water \n\nelectrical conductivity analysis and borehole water-inflow tests. \n\nGV4\n\nGV3\n\nGV2\n\nGV1\n\n987 10 11 12 1365432\n\n5E 4E\n\n3E 2E 1E 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1D\n\n2D\n\n1\nL.B.

For \n\neach test interval, flow rates and water pressures in the hole being tested and in the nearby \n\nboreholes are recorded until steady state conditions are achieved. In this study closed \n\nboreholes are simulated by constraining the hydraulic head to be an unknown constant along \n\neach borehole\u2019s length, at the same time not allowing water to flow out of the hole. Closed \n\nborehole intervals, either with single or double packers, are simulated in the same way, this \n\ntime allowing discharges above the single packer, or above the upper packer whenever a \n\ndouble packer is used. Areas where flow paths cross the drains are modelled by bands of \n\nelements of higher permeability. With the current 3DEC code it is not possible to display \n\nneither these bands of elements, nor areas inside one or more than one model block with a \n\ndifferent permeability, therefore three-dimensional AUTOCAD drawings were made which \n\nallow the presentation of the various models\u2019 assumed hypotheses. Figure 6.21 shows a 3D \n\nperspective of a part of the 9 m wide foundation model in relation to the dam, in which the \n\nthree drains included in the model are shown in red and the grout curtain, located upstream \n\nfrom the drains, is shown in dark gray.    \n\n6.4.2 Numerical modelling of tests carried out in drain D25 D \n\n6.4.2.1 Introduction \n\nTests carried out in drain D25 D led to the conclusion that water flowed into the borehole in \n\nthe top 10 m and that 90 % of the water flowed into the borehole at between 4.0 to 7.0 m \n\ndown from the drain head. As shown in Figure 6.20 water inflow in drain D26 D was only \n\nobserved at between 4.0 and 5.0 m down from the drain head, and drain D24 D was \n\nobstructed 0.65 m below concrete/rock mass interface. To simulate tests carried out in drain \n\nD25 D, where only a single area where water flowed into the borehole was observed, it was \n\nnecessary to develop a model which could simulate two different situations (Figure 6.22): \n\n- normal operating conditions;  \n\n- drain D25 D closed. \n\nIn situ results on two different dates had been recorded with differences in the water level in \n\nthe reservoir of 6.5 m. Table 6.10 shows the observed discharges and water pressures of both \n\nsituations on the two different dates. Results presented reveal that the raising of the reservoir \n\nfrom elevation 143.6 m up to elevation 150.0 m leads to a slight increase in flow rates (8.5 % \n\nup to 19 %). On both dates, when drain D25 D is closed water pressures of about 5.0 bar are \n\nreached, which correspond to almost 60 % of the hydraulic head. \n\n \n\n\n\n 227 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9m wide foundation model in relation to the dam Model detail in the vicinity of the drains \n\nFigure 6.21 \u2013 Perspective of the three-dimensional AUTOCAD drawing developed to \n\nrepresent the various models\u2019 assumed hypotheses. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNormal operating conditions Drain D25 D closed \n\nFigure 6.22 \u2013 Situations to be considered to simulate tests carried out in drain D25 D. \n\n \n\n \n\nDate \n\n \n\nH \nreservoir \n\n(m) \n\nNormal operating \n\nconditions \n\n Drain D25 D closed \n\nDischarge  \n\n(l/min) \n\n Discharge \n\n (l/min) \n\nWater \n\npressure \n\n(bar) \n\nPercentage \n\nof hydraulic \n\nhead (%) \n\nD24 D D25 D D26 D  D24 D D25 D D26 D D25 D D25 D \n\nOct. 2006 143.6 0.04 2.01 1.03  0.04 - 1.29 4.825 58.6 % \n\nMar. 2007 150.0 drops 2.18 1.23  drops - 1.53 5.250 59.1 % \n\nTable 6.10 \u2013 Discharges and water pressures measured in drains D24 D, D25 D and D26 D \n\nboth in normal operating conditions and with drain D25 D closed. \n\nD26 D\n\nD25 D\nD24 D\n\nD26 D\n\nD25 D closed\n\nD24 D\n\nD26 D\n\nD25 D closed\n\nD24 D\n\n\n\n   228 \n\n6.4.2.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions \n\nThe first numerical analysis, presented in section 6.2, was carried out assuming the reservoir \n\nat an elevation of 143.0 m and the water downstream from the dam-wall at an elevation of \n\n75.0 m. A zero pressure was assumed at the drains\u2019 head. These boundary conditions are \n\nadequate in a global seepage model of the foundation. However, for a detailed analysis of \n\nseepage in a restricted area, the downstream boundary condition is not appropriate, as the \n\ngrout and drainage curtains drilled from the downstream dam-wall change seepage flow in the \n\nupstream-downstream direction. Therefore, the following numerical analysis was carried out \n\nassuming the hydraulic head recorded at the piezometers installed at the substation slab, at the \n\ntoe of the dam. From 16-20 October 2006, with the reservoir at an elevation around 143.6 m, \n\nand from 19-23 March 2007, with the water level around 150.0 m, average hydraulic heads of \n\n69.9 m and 70.3 m were recorded at the mentioned piezometers. A hydraulic head of 70.0 m \n\nwas assumed on both dates. With these boundary conditions, the model could have been \n\nshortened downstream from the dam, in order to reduce run times, but it was decided to \n\nmaintain it. \n\n6.4.2.3 Numerical experiments \n\nThe detailed 3D model to simulate tests carried out in drain D25 D was developed in various \n\nsteps with progressive enhancements, shown in Figure 6.23. In each one of these steps the two \n\nsituations to be simulated were taken into account and the different parameters were adjusted \n\nin order to make the numerical results correspond more closely to the observed discharges and \n\nwater pressures, shown in Table 6.11. It is assumed that the rock mass foundation is \n\nhomogeneous and isotropic and that the grout curtain is 10 times less pervious than the rock \n\nmass. \n\nFirstly, a homogeneous and isotropic media was assumed and the rock mass permeability \n\nnecessary to obtain the average value of the discharges in drain D25 D\u2019s area of influence was \n\ndetermined (Figure 6.23 - Step 1). Secondly, a near-surface area of higher permeability \n\nupstream from the dam was considered, in order to simulate the assumed existence of vertical \n\nfissures within the rock mass close to the heel of the dam (Figure 6.23 - Step 2). These \n\nfissures are opened by the development of tensile stresses in this area, due to the filling of the \n\nreservoir. Thirdly, a horizontal layer of higher permeability between the upstream area and the \n\ndrains was considered. This layer crosses the grout curtain, simulating a probable area of the \n\nfoundation where the total sealing of discontinuities with very small apertures was not \n\nachieved (gap in the grout curtain). It was first assumed that this layer of higher permeability \n\nwas 3.0 m deep and crossed the whole model\u2019s width (Figure 6.23 \u2013 Step 3) but the layer \n\nwidth was then gradually changed, in order for numerical values to correspond to recorded \n\ndischarges and water pressures (Figure 6.23 \u2013 Steps 4 and 5). Finally two different layers \n\n\n\n 229 \n\nwere modelled upstream from drains D25 D and D26 D; both layers are 3.0 m deep but the \n\nlayer at D26 D is 2.0 m higher to take into account the point at which discontinuities cross \n\neach one of the drains (Figure 6.23 \u2013 Step 6). With this final change numerical results were \n\ncloser to observed values. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 1 -  Homogeneous and \n\nisotropic rock mass. \n\nStep 2 - Near-surface area of \n\nhigher permeability upstream \n\nfrom the dam. \n\nStep 3 - Horizontal layer of \n\nhigher permeability between the \n\nupstream area and the drains, \n\ncrossing the whole model\u2019s width. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 4 - Horizontal layer of \n\nhigher permeability between the \n\nupstream area and the drains, \n\nupstream from drain D25 D. \n\nStep 5 - Horizontal layer of \n\nhigher permeability between the \n\nupstream area and the drains, \n\nupstream from drain D25 D and \n\nwith a width equal to half the \n\ndistance between drains, close to \n\ndrain D25 D, upstream from drain \n\nD26 D. \n\nStep 6 - Horizontal layers of \n\nhigher permeability between the \n\nupstream area and drains D25 D \n\nand D26 D: \n\ni -  with a width equal to the \n\ndistance between drains, \n\nupstream from drain D25 D; \n\nand  \n\nii - with a width equal to half the \n\ndistance between drains, close \n\nto drain D25 D, upstream \n\nfrom drain D26 D. \n\nThe layer at drain D26 D is 2.0 m \n\nhigher. \n\nFigure 6.23 \u2013 Steps of model elaboration. \n\nD26 D\n\nD25 D\nD24 D\n\n\n\n   230 \n\n \n\nDate \n\n \n\nH  \n\nreservoir  \n\n(m) \n\n \n\nH  \n\ndownstream  \n\n(m) \n\n \n\nH \n\n substation  \n\nslab  \n\n(m) \n\nDischarge \n\nin drain \n\nD25 D \n\n(l/min) \n\nAverage discharge in drain \n\nD25 D\u2019s area of influence \n\n(l/min)/m) \n\nWater \n\npressure with \n\ndrain D25 D \n\nclosed \n\n(bar) \n\nincluding \n\nD25 D \n\nnot including \n\nD25 D \n\nOct. 2006 143.6 81.95 69.9 2.01 0.23 0.12 4.825 \n\nMar. 2007 150.0 81.60 70.3 2.18 0.27 0.15 5.25 \n\nTable 6.11 \u2013 Observed discharges in both drain D25 D and its area of influence, and water \n\npressure at the drain head when it is closed. \n\nDuring the model\u2019s development the first numerical experiments were carried out with a \n\nsingle strip 1.5 m wide and with a drain 25 m long. In order to avoid errors, an auxiliary \n\nmodel was also used, similar to that described in the previous section (section 6.3) but in \n\nwhich the parallel vertical foundation strips are positioned in such a way as to build a brick \n\nshape 9 m wide. Each drain is 25 m long and the same hydraulic head is assumed in the \n\nmodel\u2019s three drains. The model described in section 6.3, which takes into account both the \n\nhorizontal and vertical curvatures of the dam where it meets the foundation, was used as a \n\nbasis for the development of the seepage model in the vicinity of drain D25 D. In this latter \n\nmodel, the hydraulic head in each drain is the same as the drain head\u2019s elevation. The drains \n\nwere first assumed to be 25 m long, in order to compare numerical results with those obtained \n\nwith the auxiliary model. The drains\u2019 real length was used once the model had been \n\ndeveloped.  \n\nNumerical experiments were carried out comparing the numerical results to the monitoring \n\ndata collected in October 2006. A detailed description of results obtained in each modelling \n\nstep is presented in the following paragraphs.  In order to make the comparison of observed \n\nand numerical discharges easier, results are shown in (l/min) or ((l/min)/m). \n\nFirst modelling step (Figure 6.23 - Step 1): a homogeneous and isotropic media was \n\nassumed. In a rock mass of uniform permeability k, the leakage varies linearly with k. \n\nNumerical analysis was carried out for two different hydraulic conductivity values: \n\n1.5 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s and 5.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s (Table 6.12). Taking into account these results and the linear \n\nrelationship between discharges and hydraulic conductivity values, a rock mass hydraulic \n\nconductivity of  4.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s was first assumed in order to match the average discharge \n\nobserved in drain D25 D\u2019s area of influence (0.23 (l/min)/m). As it had been observed that \n\nthere is a seepage path crossing drain D25 D in its upper area, and the highest discharge is that \n\nobserved in drain D25 D, it was later realised that rock mass permeability should be less than \n\n4.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s. The average discharge recorded in drain D25 D\u2019s area of influence, not \n\nincluding discharge in drain D25 D (0.12 (l/min)/m) would be achieved with a rock mass \n\npermeability of 2.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s. However, the results of Lugeon type tests carried out while \n\n\n\n 231 \n\ndrilling boreholes D24 D and D26 D led to the conclusion that, in the boreholes\u2019 vicinity the \n\nrock mass hydraulic conductivity was about 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s (in drain D25 D rotary-percussive \n\ndrilling was used; therefore no borehole log is available). A rock mass of 1.0 \u00d7 10\n -8\n\n m/s was \n\nafterwards assumed. The average discharge is 0.17 l/min, or 0.06 (l/min)/m, which is 26 % of \n\nthe observed discharge. This homogeneous model does not take into account either the usual \n\nexistence of vertical or sub-vertical fissures within the rock mass close to the heel of the dam \n\nor the seepage paths detected while carrying out the borehole water-inflow tests. \n\nSecond modelling step (Figure 6.23 - Step 2): In a second modelling step, the existence of a \n\nnear-surface area of higher permeability upstream from the dam was considered. It was \n\nassumed that this area\u2019s hydraulic conductivity was 10.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s and that it was 7.0 m deep \n\nand 5.0 m long in the upstream-downstream direction. Table 6.13 shows the numerical results \n\nobtained with the three different models described on the previous page. It can be seen that \n\nthe three models lead to the same average discharge. The model that takes into account \n\ncurvatures of the dam where it meets the foundation leads to different discharges in the three \n\ndrains, because each drain head is at a different elevation. In this case, about 40 % of the total \n\ndischarge flows out of the model through drain D24 D, about 36 % through drain D25 D and \n\nabout 24 % through drain D26 D. With this area of higher permeability, the average discharge \n\nincreases about 24 % (from 0.17 l/min up to 0.21 l/min). \n\nIn a homogeneous and isotropic media the discharge per metre through a layer of height h is \n\ngiven by: \n\nhikq ?\n (6.1) \n\nFlow in planar rock fractures can be modelled by means of the parallel plate model and the \n\nflow rate per unit width is thus expressed by the cubic law: \n\ni\nga\n\navq\n?12\n\n3\n\n??  \n(6.2) \n\nIn the previous equations: k = hydraulic conductivity (m/s); i = hydraulic gradient (m/m); \n\na = fracture hydraulic aperture (m); ? = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m\n2\n/s); and \n\ng = acceleration of gravity (m/s\n2\n).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   232 \n\nModel \n\nRock mass \n\npermeability \n\n(\u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s) \n\nDischarge   (l/min) Average \n\ndischarge \n\n((l/min)/m) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\nD24 D D25 D D26 D \n\nHomogeneous \n\nand isotropic \n\nrock mass \n\n1.0 -0.17 - 0.17 - 0.00 0.06 \n\n1.5 - 0.26 - 0.26 - 0.00 0.09 \n\n5.0 -0.85 - 0.85 - 0.00 0.28 \n\nTable 6.12 \u2013 Numerical discharges for different rock mass hydraulic conductivity values \n\n(model shown in Figure 6.23 - Step 1 (with a single strip 1.5 m wide)). \n\n \n\nModel Discharge   (l/min) Average \n\ndischarge \n\n((l/min)/m) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\nD24 D D25 D D26 D \n\nSingle strip 1.5 m wide - 0.11 - 0.207 - 0.00 0.07 \n\nAuxiliary model  - 0.63 0.207 0.208 0.207 0.01 0.07 \n\nModel that takes into account \n\ncurvatures of the dam where it \n\nmeets the foundation \n- 0.60 0.255 0.226 0.151 -0.01 0.07 \n\nTable 6.13 \u2013 Numerical discharges in models where a small area of higher permeability \n\nupstream from the dam is considered (k near surface area upstream from the dam = 10.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s) (Figure \n\n6.23 - Step 2). \n\nThe average value of the fracture hydraulic aperture is determined equalling Equations 6.1 \n\nand 6.2. In the case being studied, k = 10.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s; h = 5.0 m; ?  = 1.01 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n m\n2\n/s (water \n\nat 20 \u00b0C); and g = 9.8 m/s\n2\n. Taking Equation 6.2 into account, the near-surface area of higher \n\npermeability upstream from the dam simulates a vertical discontinuity with a hydraulic \n\naperture of 0.18 mm. \n\nThird modelling step (Figure 6.23 - Step 3): As previously mentioned, 90 % of the water \n\nflowed into drain D25 D at between 4.0 to 7.0 m down from the drain head. To take into \n\naccount this observed seepage path, a horizontal layer of higher permeability between the \n\nupstream area and the drains was considered. This layer is 3.0 m deep, and crosses drain \n\nD25 D at between 4.0 to 7.0 m down from the drain head. Numerical experiments were \n\ncarried out with different permeability values (Table 6.14). Taking into account these results, \n\na horizontal layer\u2019s hydraulic conductivity of 5.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s was assumed, in order for the \n\nnumerical discharge to correspond to that recorded in drain D25 D. \n\n \n\n\n\n 233 \n\nModel horizontal \n\nlayer\u2019s \n\npermeability \n\n(\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s) \n\nDischarge   (l/min) Average \n\ndischarge \n\n((l/min)/m) \n\n upstream drain downstream \n\n D24 D D25 D D26 D \n\n \n\nSingle strip \n\n1.5 m wide \n\n1.0 - 0.57 - 0.57 - 0.00 0.19 \n\n2.5 - 1.11 - 1.11 - 0.00 0.37 \n\n4.0 - 1.64 - 1.63 - 0.00 0.54 \n\n5.0 - 1.98 - 1.98 - 0.00 0.66 \n\nTable 6.14 - Numerical discharges for different hydraulic conductivity values of the \n\nhorizontal layer upstream from the drains (model shown in Figure 6.23- Step 3 (with a single \n\nstrip 1.5 m wide)). \n\nWhen the above-mentioned parameters are considered in the model that takes into account \n\ncurvatures of the dam where it meets the foundation, the numerical discharges are: \n\n \n\n Q upstream = - 5.21 l/min  Q drain D24 D = 2.61 l/min  \n\n   Q drain D25 D = 1.89 l/min  \n\n Q downstream = 0.01 l/min  Q drain D26 D = 1.33 l/min  \n  \n\nModelling steps 4 and 5 (Figure 6.23 - Steps 4 and 5): Numerical experiments were carried \n\nout with different layer widths, in order to make numerical results correspond to recorded \n\ndischarges and water pressures.

In these modelling steps, numerical analysis was carried out not only with the three \n\ndrains\u2019 assumed length of 25.0 m but also considering their real length.

These layers simulate horizontal discontinuities with a hydraulic \n\naperture of 0.12 mm. New numerical analysis was carried out assuming the water level in the \n\nreservoir and the hydraulic head recorded at the piezometers installed at the substation slab in \n\nMarch 2007. \n\nFigure 6.24 shows the parameter values used in the final model. Table 6.16 shows a \n\ncomparison of recorded and numerical discharges and water pressures of both simulated \n\nsituations on the two different dates (numerical results are shown in red). With this model, \n\nnumerical discharges are about 8 % to 10 % higher than the recorded discharges and water \n\npressures are about 6 % to 13 % lower, which can be considered sufficiently accurate. It can \n\nalso be concluded that there is no change in the layers\u2019 hydraulic aperture due to increase in \n\nthe water level in the reservoir from elevation 143.6 m up to 150.0 m. \n\nFigure 6.25 shows the flow of water (l/min) entering each borehole water-inflow test interval, \n\ncompared with the numerical results.

Drain D25 D is located in a particular \n\narea, where the bottom of the valley meets the right hand side abutment. In order to assess the \n\neffect of surface topography on water flow in the area between drain D25 D and the other two \n\ndrains which are included in the model (D24 D on the valley floor and D26 D at the base of \n\nthe slope), and study the distribution of discharges between the drains due to model geometry, \n\na numerical experiment was carried out assuming that the hydraulic head in each one of the \n\ndrains is the same as the drain\u2019s head elevation, and neglecting the existence of water in the \n\nreservoir and in the area downstream from the dam. The medium was assumed to be \n\nhomogeneous with a hydraulic conductivity of 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s. The numerical experiments \n\nwere carried out (Figure 6.27): i) assuming the three drains with a length of 25.0 m; and \n\nii) considering the drains\u2019 real length, assuming that drain D24 D is clogged from 6.75 m \n\ndownwards. Numerical discharges are shown in Table 6.17. Results analysis reveals that: \n\ni) water flows into the model through drain D26 D and out of the model through the \n\nother two drains; \n\nii) as expected, numerical discharges through the upstream and downstream areas are \n\nin practice zero, as they are four orders of magnitude smaller than drains\u2019 \n\nnumerical discharges; \n\niii) when it is assumed that the three drains are 25.0 m long, about 42 % of the water \n\nflows out of the model through drain D24 D and about 58 % through drain D25 D; \n\niv) when the drains\u2019 real length is used, only about 10 % of the water flows out of the \n\nmodel through drain D24 D and about 90 % through drain D25 D. \n\nD26 D\n\nD25 D\nD24 D\n\n \n\n \n\nD26 D\n\nD25 D\n\nD24 D\n\n \n\n \n\nDrain Length (m) \n\nD24 D 6.75 \n\nD25 D 23.57 \n\nD26 D 25.25 \n \n\ni) drains 25.0 m long  ii) drains\u2019 real length  \n\nFigure 6.27 \u2013 Seepage model to study the effect of local surface topography. \n\n\n\n   238 \n\nDrains\u2019 \n\nlength  \n \n\n(m) \n\nDischarge \n\n(m\n3\n/s) \n\nWater \n\nflowing \n\ninto the \n\nmodel \n\n(\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n \n\nm\n3\n/s) \n\nWater \n\nflowing \n\nout of the \n\nmodel \n\n(\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n \n\nm\n3\n/s) \n\nOut-of-\n\nbalance \n\nflow \n\n \n\n(\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n \n\nm\n3\n/s) \n\n upstream drain  (\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n) downstream \n\n (\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n) D24 D D25 D D26 D (\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n) \n\n25.0 0.00044 1.5256 2.1124 - 3.8998 0.00029 3.6998 3.6380 9.6 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n \n\nReal 0.00046 3.0815 2.8052 - 3.1834 0.00039 3.1834 3.1133 1.1 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n \n\nTable 6.17 \u2013 Distribution of discharges between the drains due to model geometry. \n\n6.4.3 Numerical modelling of tests carried out in drain D20 D \n\n6.4.3.1 Introduction \n\nTests carried out in drain D20 D led to the conclusion that water flowed into the borehole in \n\ntwo distinct areas: at between 8.0 to 9.0 m and at between 4.0 to 6.0 m down from the drain \n\nhead. As shown in Figure 6.20 water inflow in the adjacent drains, D19 D and D21 D, also \n\noccurred in an area very close to the concrete/rock mass interface: in drain D19 D both at the \n\nconcrete/rock mass interface and at 6.5 to 7.5 down from the drain head, and in drain D21 D \n\nin the first 2.0 m down from the concrete/foundation interface. Test results led to the \n\nconclusion that, unlike the lower flow path crossing drain D20 D, the upper was linked to \n\nboth the adjacent drains. The model developed for the analysis of the tests in drain D20 D, \n\nshould be able to simulate four different situations (Figure 6.28): \n\n- normal operating conditions;  \n\n- drain D20 D closed; \n\n- the single packer placed 7.0 m down from the drain head; and \n\n- the double packer placed in such a way that the test interval extended from 4.0 to \n\n7.0 m down from the drain head. \n\nTable 6.18 shows the observed discharges and water pressures in the four different situations \n\nrecorded in the tests carried out in September 2007. The average discharges in drain D20 D\u2019s \n\narea of influence, including and not including discharge in drain D20 D, were 0.07 and \n\n0.02 (l/min)/m, respectively. In March 2007, with the water level in the reservoir around \n\n150.0 m, the discharge in drain D20 D was 0.93 l/min and the water pressure when the drain \n\nwas closed 1.20 bar, which corresponded to 13.6 % of the hydraulic head. \n\n \n\n\n\n 239 \n\n \n\nD19 D    D20 D    D21 D\n\n4.0\n6.08.0\n\n9.0\n\n \n\n \n\nD19 D    D20 D    D21 D\n \n\ni) Normal operating conditions ii) Drain D20 D closed. \n\nD19 D    D20 D    D21 D\n \n\nD19 D    D20 D    D21 D\n \n\niii) Single packer placed 7.0 m down from the \n\ndrain head. \n\niv) Double packer placed at between 4.0 to 7.0 \n\nm down from the drain head. \n\nFigure 6.28 \u2013 Situations to be considered to simulate tests carried out in drain D20 D. \n\n \n\n Discharge  \n\n(l/min) \n\nWater \n\npressure  \n\n(bar) \n\nHydraulic \n\nhead  \n\n(m) \n\nPercentage of \n\nhydraulic head  \n\n(%) \n\n D19 D D20 D D21 D D20 D D20 D  \n\n1.

From 3-7 September 2007, with the reservoir at an \n\nelevation around 148.0 m, an average hydraulic head of 72.7 m was recorded at the \n\npiezometers.  \n\n6.4.3.3 Numerical experiments \n\nThe detailed 3D model to simulate tests carried out in drain D20 D was developed in a similar \n\nway to that for drain D25 D. However, a greater number of numerical experiments had to be \n\ncarried out, due to difficulties found during the model\u2019s development. As previously, it is \n\nassumed that the rock mass foundation is homogeneous and isotropic and that the grout \n\ncurtain is 10 times less pervious. \n\nFirstly, a homogeneous and isotropic media was assumed and the rock mass hydraulic \n\nconductivity necessary to obtain the average value of the discharges in drain D20 D\u2019s area of \n\ninfluence, not including discharge in drain D20 D, was determined. In drain D20 D\u2019s area of \n\ninfluence, discharges are very low, therefore a hydraulic conductivity of 1.5 \u00d7 10\n-9\n\n m/s was \n\nfirst assumed. Lugeon type tests carried out while drilling drains D18 D and D20 D led to the \n\nconclusion that the hydraulic conductivity was almost zero in most of the test intervals. At \n\ndrain D18 D\u2019s upper section, in a length of 5.0 m down from concrete/rock mass interface and \n\nat drain D20 D\u2019s lower area, permeability values of 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s were recorded. \n\nSecondly, a near-surface area of higher permeability upstream from the dam was considered. \n\nThis area is identical to the one considered in the model presented in the previous chapter, \n\nboth in dimension and hydraulic conductivity. With this area of higher permeability, \n\ndischarge increases about 22 % (from 0.027 l/min to 0.033 l/min). \n\nIn the above-mentioned steps only the first test stage, simulating normal operating conditions, \n\nwas modelled. \n\nThirdly, a horizontal layer of higher permeability between the upstream area and drain D20 D \n\nwas considered. This layer was located 8.0 to 9.0 m down from the drain head, in order to \n\nsimulate the lower seepage path. Several numerical experiments were carried out in order to \n\nmake results correspond to the observed discharges and water pressures, in normal operating \n\nconditions, with drain D20 D closed, and with the single packer placed 7.0 m down the from \n\nthe drain head. It was observed that with the hydraulic conductivity necessary to achieve the \n\nrecorded discharge in drain D20 D, the water pressure below the packer was much higher than \n\nthat recorded. Numerical discharges in adjacent drains were lower than those recorded. \n\n\n\n 241 \n\nTo reduce water pressures, it was assumed that the top 5.0 m of the foundation rock mass \n\nwere more pervious than the remaining domain. This upper area of higher hydraulic \n\nconductivity tried to simulate a more disturbed area, due to foundation excavation. The \n\nexistence of this area would lead to greater discharges and, consequently, lower water \n\npressures. Results were only slighted altered when the existence of this area was taken into \n\naccount, thus it was decided not to make this change. \n\nIn order to reduce water pressures, at the same time maintaining the numerical discharge in \n\ndrain D20 D, the horizontal layer of higher permeability upstream from the drain was \n\nextended 35.0 m downstream to reach the substation. It was later realised that in the model \n\nthis layer should be at least 2.0 m deep, to include all the zones. Due to great difficulties in \n\nmaking numerical discharges in drains D19 D and D21 D correspond to recorded discharges, \n\nit was decided to consider the average value of the discharges recorded in these two drains. In \n\nthis case, advantage was taken of symmetry and therefore only one half of the domain width \n\nwas taken into account in subsequent analysis. \n\nAnother attempt was made to reduce water pressures, increasing the rock mass hydraulic \n\nconductivity at its lower depths. This would also lead to a greater discharge in adjacent drains. \n\nNumerical experiments were carried out with rock mass hydraulic conductivity values varying \n\nfrom 1.5 \u00d7 10\n-9\n\n m/s up to 7.5 \u00d7 10\n-9\n\n m/s. In each numerical experiment, the horizontal layer\u2019s \n\nhydraulic conductivity had to be adjusted. \n\nThe existence of the upper seepage path was afterwards simulated with a layer of higher \n\npermeability which extended from the upstream area to the substation. Once again, with the \n\nhydraulic conductivity values necessary to achieve the discharge distribution along drain \n\nD20 D, the numerical water pressures were much higher than those recorded. \n\nWhile carrying out borehole water-inflow tests in drain D20 D it was observed that there was \n\na small quantity of water leaking from the floor of the downstream drainage gallery. When the \n\nborehole was closed the amount of water increased. The lower recorded water pressures could \n\nbe due to this loss of water; therefore to simulate this leakage, an additional hydraulic \n\nboundary condition was considered: it was assumed that 14.0 m downstream from the drain, \n\nin a square with sides 4.0 m long, the hydraulic head on the model\u2019s upper horizontal \n\nboundary was the same as the gallery floor elevation. \n\nFinally, the upper layer\u2019s hydraulic conductivity downstream from the drain was increased. \n\nThis change led to almost the same numerical discharges in drains and to lower water \n\npressures. The layer\u2019s lower hydraulic conductivity upstream from the drain simulates the \n\npresence of the grout curtain, which is probably partially inefficient in this area.    \n\n\n\n   242 \n\nFigure 6.29 shows the parameter values used in the final model. Table 6.19 shows a \n\ncomparison of recorded and numerical discharges and water pressures in the four different \n\nsituations (numerical results are shown in red). With this model, numerical discharges in drain \n\nD20 D are about 3 % to 15 % lower than the recorded discharges and the differences in \n\nhydraulic head are less than 8 %, which, as in the case of drain D25 D, can be considered \n\nsufficiently accurate. However, the model does not simulate properly the increase in \n\ndischarges in the adjacent drains when drain D20 D is closed (modelling situations 2 and 4).  \n\nAnalysis of numerical discharges, shown in Table 6.20, reveals that in the four different \n\nsituations about 68 % of the quantity of water that flows into the model comes from the \n\nreservoir and the remaining water from downstream. The leakage from the floor of the \n\ndownstream drainage gallery plays a significant role in the model, as: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  k  (\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s)   k  (\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s) \n\nRock mass  0.03 Upper layer of higher \n\npermeability upstream from \n\nthe drains \n\n 1.5 \n\nGrout curtain  0.003 Upper layer of higher \n\npermeability downstream \n\nfrom the drains \n\n 30.0 \n\nNear-surface area \n\nupstream from the dam \n\n 10.0 Lower layer of higher \n\npermeability \n\n 0.43 \n\nFigure 6.29 \u2013 Seepage model in the vicinity of drain D20 D. Model parameters.  \n\n \n0 25 m\n\n\n\n 243 \n\n- in modelling situations 1 and 3, discharge in drain D20 D is very close to that lost \n\nthrough the leak; and  \n\n- in modelling situations 2 and 4, the quantity of water flowing out of the model from \n\nthe leakage is more than 80 % of the discharge coming into the model. \n\nHowever, these results do not correspond to what was observed, as, although there was no \n\nway of measuring, it was evident that the amount of discharge was very small, apparently less \n\nthan 0.05 l/min. In this final model, the lower layer, with a hydraulic conductivity of \n\n4.3 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s, simulates a horizontal discontinuity with a hydraulic aperture of only 0.05 mm. \n\nThe upper layer, with an equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 5.41 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, simulates a \n\nlayer with a hydraulic aperture of 0.11 mm. \n\nFigure 6.30 shows the discharge (l/min) entering each borehole water-inflow test interval, \n\ncompared with the numerical results.

The drain\u2019s \n\nrecorded discharge in normal operating conditions (reference discharge) is also shown. Figure \n\n6.31 shows the parameter values of an alternative model, in which it is assumed that the grout \n\ncurtain is partially inefficient in the area where it is crossed by the upper layer of higher \n\nhydraulic conductivity. Analysis of discharges and water pressures obtained with this model \n\n(Table 6.21) leads to the conclusion that results are only slightly different from those obtained \n\nwith the model shown in Figure 6.29. \n\n \n\n Discharge  \n\n(l/min) \n\nWater \n\npressure  \n\n(bar) \n\nHydraulic \n\nhead  \n\n(m) \n\nPercentage of \n\nhydraulic head  \n\n(%) \n\n D19 D D20 D D21 D D20 D D20 D  \n\n1.

In reality there are discontinuities linking the different drains which lead to flow \n\nbetween drains, not just through the rock mass. \n\nAn additional weakness of this model is the excessive floor leakage, which in reality is only a \n\nvery small amount, probably no greater than 0.05 l/min. This excess in the model can be \n\nexplained by the larger quantity of water flowing from downstream. \n\n6.4.4 Conclusions \n\nA numerical simulation of borehole water-inflow tests carried out in two restricted foundation \n\nareas was carried out. Results of rock mass in situ permeability tests and areas where seepage \n\npaths cross each drain, identified with both borehole water-inflow tests and water electrical \n\nconductivity analysis, were taken into account. The analysis described in this section indicates \n\nthat equivalent continuum models can be used successfully to model the hydraulic behaviour \n\nof specific areas of the foundation. The validity of the numerical models was assessed by \n\ncomparing the numerical results to the readings taken while carrying out borehole water-\n\ninflow tests (discharges and water pressures). \n\nTests carried out in drain D25 D were easily simulated as there was only one area where water \n\nflowed into the borehole and therefore there were only two different situations to be taken into \n\naccount. Tests carried out in drain D20 D led to the conclusion that seepage paths crossed the \n\ndrain at two different elevations, which led to a far more complex model, as the number of \n\nparameters increased and there were more situations to be simulated with the same model. \n\nModels were validated against data collected in situ. During model development, parameters \n\nwere continually adjusted as necessary. Back-analysis techniques are sometimes used to \n\ndetermine unknown or ill-known physical parameters (e.g. Castro 1997); however, in this \n\ncase, even with the low number of parameters considered in each model, this would have \n\npresented significant difficulties, namely due to the excessive run-times required. Therefore, \n\nduring the model\u2019s development, a trial-and-error estimating procedure was carried out to \n\ncontinually adjust parameters. \n\nIn the following section the influence of the different parameters on numerical results is \n\nanalysed. As will be shown in section 6.6, parameters determined using detailed numerical \n\nmodels can not be used directly in a global 3D model of the dam foundation. In fact, in this \n\ntype of models, only average measurements can be simulated. \n\n \n\n\n\n 247 \n\n6.5 Parameter studies \n\n6.5.1 Introduction \n\nThis section describes the parametric studies carried out to identify which of the parameters in \n\nthe model developed to simulate seepage in drain D25 D\u2019s vicinity, presented in section 6.4.2, \n\nhave the greatest influence on the numerical discharges and hydraulic heads. A series of \n\nnumerical experiments was performed by varying the value of one parameter while the other \n\nparameters were kept constant. Analysis was carried out to investigate the effect of:  \n\ni) rock mass permeability;  \n\nii) grout curtain permeability;  \n\niii) higher rock mass permeability upstream from the dam; \n\niv) permeability of horizontal layers upstream from the drains; and  \n\nv) width of higher permeability layers upstream from the drains.  \n\nThe influence of total or partial clogging of drain D24 D was also investigated. \n\n6.5.2 Influence of rock mass permeability \n\nTo assess the influence of rock mass permeability, a comparison was made between the \n\nnumerical discharges and the numerical water pressure at drain D25 D when closed, with the \n\nrock mass permeability varying from 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-9\n\n m/s up to 10 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. Results in each of the \n\ncases studied can be found in Table 6.22 and Figure 6.32, in which numerical results obtained \n\nwith the model for drain D25 D (\u201creference values\u201d) are highlighted. \n\nAnalysis of Figure 6.32 leads to the conclusion that discharges in drains increase \n\napproximately in a linear way with an increase in rock mass permeability. In normal operating \n\nconditions the greatest discharge increase occurs in drain D25 D. Drain D24 D is clogged \n\n0.65 m below concrete/rock mass interface, therefore the rate of increase is smaller.  \n\nIn the model for drain D25 D it is assumed that there is a near-surface area of higher \n\npermeability upstream from the dam and two horizontal layers of higher permeability between \n\nthe upstream area and drains D25 D and D26 D. Having this model in mind, if the rock mass \n\nwere impervious and drain D25 D were closed, the hydraulic head at drain D25 D would be \n\nthe same as that of the reservoir. As rock mass permeability increases, there is a simultaneous \n\nincrease in discharges and decrease in the hydraulic head at drain D25 D. \n\n \n\n\n\n   248 \n\n \n\nRock mass \n\nhydraulic \n\nconductivity \n\n(\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s) \n\nDischarge \n\n(l/min) \n\nAverage \n\ndischarge \n\n((l/min)/m) \n\nWater \n\npressure \n\nat drain  \n\nD25 D\u2019s \n\nhead (bar) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\nD24 D D25 D D26 D \n\nN\no\n\nrm\na\nl \n\no\np\n\ne\nra\n\nti\nn\n\ng\n \n\nc\no\n\nn\nd\n\nit\nio\n\nn\ns \n\n0.01 - 1.85 0.01 1.93 0.62 0.00 0.28 - \n\n0.05 - 2.08 0.04 2.05 0.72 0.01 0.31 - \n\n0.1 - 2.33 0.07 2.18 0.82 0.02 0.34 - \n\n0.5 - 3.86 0.28 2.95 1.43 0.08 0.52 - \n\n1.0 - 5.44 0.50 3.78 2.06 0.13 0.70 - \n\n5.0 15.59 1.68 9.42 6.14 0.38 1.92 - \n\n10.0 25.98 2.64 15.58 10.39 0.52 3.72 - \n\nD\nra\n\nin\n D\n\n2\n5\n\n D\n c\n\nlo\nse\n\nd\n \n\n0.01 1.03 0.02 - 1.41 0.00 0.16 4.91 \n\n0.05 1.27 0.08 - 1.60 0.03 0.19 4.55 \n\n0.1 1.53 0.15 - 1.82 0.05 0.22 4.18 \n\n0.5 3.10 0.52 - 3.10 0.18 0.40 2.83 \n\n1.0 4.67 0.85 - 4.38 0.30 0.58 2.26 \n\n5.0 14.40 2.68 - 12.64 0.94 1.70 1.46 \n\n10.0 24.34 4.34 - 21.44 1.49 2.86 1.26 \n \n\nTable 6.22 \u2013 Numerical discharges and water pressures for different rock mass permeability \n\nvalues in normal operating conditions and with drain D25 D closed. \nD25 D - influence of rock mass permeability\n\n0.0\n\n3.0\n\n6.0\n\n9.0\n\n12.0\n\n15.0\n\n18.0\n\n21.0\n\n24.0\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n\nRock mass equivalent permeability   (x 10\n-7\n\n m/s)\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n6.0\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nb\na\n\nr\n)\n\n  discharge in drain D24 D   discharge in drain D25 D\n\n  discharge in drain D26 D   discharge in drain D24 D when drain D25 D is closed\n\n discharge in drain D26 D when drain D25 D is closed   water pressure at drain D25 D when closed\n\nnumerical results with the \n\nmodel for drain D25 D\n\n \n\nFigure 6.32 \u2013 Variation of discharges in each drain and in the water pressure at drain D25 D \n\nwhen closed, with different rock mass permeability values. \n\n\n\n 249 \n\nResults presented show that lowering rock mass equivalent permeability does not \n\nsignificantly alter either discharges or water pressures; but an increase has much more \n\ninfluence, leading to greater discharges and to a sudden loss of water pressure. It also leads to \n\nlarger quantities of water flowing into the drains at their lower areas, which is not realistic. \n\n6.5.3 Influence of grout curtain permeability \n\nTo assess the influence of grout curtain permeability, calculations were carried with the grout \n\ncurtain 1000, 100, 10 and 2 times less pervious than the rock mass and with the grout curtain \n\nas pervious as the rock mass. In practice, the former is equivalent to simulating an impervious \n\ngrout curtain; therefore these values encompass the range from an impervious to a non-\n\nexistent grout curtain. Results are shown in Table 6.23 and Figure 6.33. \n\nAnalysis of Figure 6.33 leads to the conclusion that changing grout curtain permeability has \n\nlittle influence on both discharges and water pressure at drain D25 D\u2019s head, when the drain is \n\nclosed. Preliminary studies of three-dimensional hydraulic foundation models, presented in \n\nchapter 5.3, led to the conclusion that decreasing grout curtain permeability leads to a \n\nconsiderable decrease in the water flow through the model and in the discharges coming to the \n\ndrain, but has little influence on the hydraulic head values. In the model being studied, both \n\nhorizontal layers of higher permeability upstream from drains D25 D and D26 D cross the \n\ngrout curtain, therefore the amount of leakage and hydraulic heads are only slightly affected \n\nby the grout curtain permeability. \n\n \n\n \n\nmassrock\n\ncurtaingrout\n\nk\n\nk\n \n\nDischarge \n\n(l/min) \n\nAverage \n\ndischarge \n\n((l/min)/m) \n\nWater \n\npressure \n\nat drain\u2019s  \n\nD25 D \n\nhead (bar) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\nD24 D D25 D D26 D \n\nN\no\n\nrm\na\nl \n\no\np\n\ne\nra\n\nti\nn\n\ng\n \n\nc\no\n\nn\nd\n\nit\nio\n\nn\ns \n\n0.001 - 2.13 0.06 2.07 0.73 0.01 0.32 - \n\n0.01 - 2.18 0.06 2.09 0.75 0.01 0.32 - \n\n0.1 - 2.33 0.07 2.18 0.82 0.02 0.34 - \n\n0.5 -2.42 0.08 2.23 0.86 0.03 0.35 - \n\n1.0 - 2.45 0.09 2.24 0.87 0.03 0.35 - \n\nD\nra\n\nin\n D\n\n2\n5\n\n D\n \n\nc\nlo\n\nse\nd\n\n \n\n0.001 - 1.41 0.13 - 1.72 0.04 0.21 4.03 \n\n0.01 - 1.44 0.14 - 1.74 0.05 0.21 4.07 \n\n0.1 - 1.53 0.15 - 1.82 0.05 0.22 4.18 \n\n0.5 1.58 0.16 - 1.86 0.06 0.23 4.24 \n\n1.0 1.60 0.17 - 1.86 0.06 0.23 4.25 \n\nTable 6.23 - Numerical discharges and water pressures for different grout curtain permeability \n\nvalues in normal operating conditions and with drain D25 D closed. \n\n\n\n   250 \n\nD25 D - influence of rock mass permeability\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12\n\nGrout curtain equivalent permeability   (x 10\n-7\n\n m/s)\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nb\na\n\nr\n)\n\n  discharge in drain D24 D   discharge in drain D25 D\n\n  discharge in drain D26 D   discharge in drain D24 D when drain D25 D is closed\n\n discharge in drain D26 D when drain D25 D is closed   water pressure at drain D25 D when closed\n\nnumerical results with the \n\nmodel for drain D25 D\n\n \n\nFigure 6.33 \u2013 Variation of discharges in each drain and in the water pressure at drain D25 D \n\nwhen closed, with different grout curtain permeability values. \n\n6.5.4 Influence of higher rock mass permeability upstream from the dam \n\nTo study the influence of higher rock mass permeability upstream from the dam numerical \n\nanalysis was carried out by varying permeability in that area from 0.1 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s (actual rock \n\nmass permeability) up to 20 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. Results are shown in Table 6.24 and Figure 6.34. \n\nResults show that when the hydraulic conductivity of the area of higher permeability increases \n\n(doubles from 10 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s to 20 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s) there is only a slight increase both in drain \n\ndischarges and water pressure when drain D25 D is closed. In the model being studied, it has \n\nbeen concluded that the majority of the water flows towards the drains first through the area \n\nof higher permeability upstream from the dam and then through the layers of higher \n\npermeability upstream from the drains. Therefore, flow is governed by an equivalent \n\nhydraulic conductivity.  \n\nIn estimating an equivalent vertical hydraulic conductivity of a layered aquifer L m deep it is \n\nassumed that the vertical velocity remains constant, thus the head loss across each layer is \n\ninversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity (the layers are horizontal and water flows \n\nin a vertical downwards direction).

Therefore, increasing a ki beyond some value has \n\nlimited effect. \n\nWhen the permeability of the near-surface area of higher permeability upstream from the dam \n\ndecreases, there is a decrease in both discharges in drains D25 D and D26 D and in the water \n\npressure at drain D25 D when closed. The decrease in discharges was expected, as in a rock \n\nmass of uniform permeability k, discharges are proportional to k. It is known that in a rock \n\nmass of non-uniform permeability with zones k1, k2, k3, etc., the seepage pressure at a given \n\npoint depends on the relative values of  k1, k2, k3, etc. (Londe 1973c). To analyse water \n\npressures in more detail, variations in hydraulic head along a horizontal line that crosses drain \n\nD25 D in the upstream-downstream direction were studied. The line crosses the horizontal \n\nlayer of higher permeability upstream from the drain at half its depth. Results of the main \n\nmodel were compared with the results of a model in which the near-surface area upstream \n\nfrom the dam is as pervious as the rock mass (model in which it is assumed that there is no \n\narea of higher permeability upstream from the dam) (Figure 6.35). \n\nThe area of higher permeability is located between mesh coordinates 10.0 m and 15.0 m in the \n\nupstream-downstream direction. Analysis of Figure 6.35 allows the comparison of the \n\ndifferent cases: \n\n- In normal operating conditions, the decrease in the permeability of the area of higher \n\npermeability from 10 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s to 0.1 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s leads to a greater loss of hydraulic \n\nhead in that area; \n\n- When drain D25 D is closed, the greater loss of hydraulic head in the area being \n\nstudied leads to a smaller hydraulic head at the point where the horizontal line meets \n\nthe layer of higher permeability upstream from the drain (line a). As the permeability \n\nis lower, discharges are smaller; therefore the loss of hydraulic head in the horizontal \n\nlayer of higher permeability upstream from the drain is smaller. This is the reason why \n\nthe slope of the blue line is less steep than that of the red one.  \n\nResults show that changing the assumed hydraulic conductivity of the near-surface area of \n\nhigher permeability upstream from the dam has limited effect; therefore the existence of \n\nvertical fissures in that area can be simulated by any k value as long as it is much greater than \n\nthat of the rock mass. \n\n\n\n 253 \n\nD25D - Potencial ao longo de uma linha horizontal (com 40 m) que intersecta o dreno, a meia altura \n\nda camada mais perme\u00e1vel a montante do dreno\n\n60.0\n\n70.0\n\n80.0\n\n90.0\n\n100.0\n\n110.0\n\n120.0\n\n130.0\n\n140.0\n\n150.0\n\n-15.0-10.0-5.00.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.0\n\nMesh coordinate in the upstream-downstream direction (m)\n\nH\ny\n\nd\nr\na\n\nu\nli\n\nc\n h\n\ne\na\nd\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n main model (1)  main model (2)\n\n no area of higher permeability upstream from the dam (1)  no area of higher permeability upstream from the dam (2)\n \n\nFigure 6.35 \u2013 Variations in hydraulic head along a horizontal line 40 m long that crosses drain \n\nD25 D in the upstream-downstream direction in the main model (reference values) and in a \n\nmodel where there is no area of higher permeability upstream from the dam. \n\n6.5.5 Influence of the permeability of the horizontal layers upstream from the \n\ndrains \n\nTo study the influence of the permeability of the horizontal layers between the upstream area \n\nand the drains, numerical analysis was carried out by varying permeability in those layers \n\nfrom 2.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s up to 20 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. Results are shown in Table 6.25 and Figure 6.36. \n\nResults show that discharges are proportional to the permeability of the horizontal layers \n\nupstream from the drains. As in the case presented in the previous sub-chapter, water \n\npressures decrease with a decrease in the horizontal layers\u2019 permeability. As previously, to \n\nanalyse water pressures in more detail, variations in hydraulic head along a horizontal line \n\nthat crosses drain D25 D and is in the upstream-downstream direction were studied and the \n\nresults of the main model, in which the permeability of the layers upstream from the drains is \n\n5.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, were compared with the results of a model in which the permeability of the \n\nlayers upstream from the drains is 2.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s (Figure 6.37). \n\n \n\n \n\ndrain \n\nInterval where the horizontal line \n\ncrosses the near-surface area of higher \n\npermeability upstream from the dam \n\na) \n\n(1) Normal operating conditions \n\n(2) Drain D25 D closed \n\n\n\n   254 \n\nThe area of higher permeability is located between mesh coordinates 10.0 m and 15.0 m and \n\nlayers of higher permeability between coordinates 0.0 m and 10.0 m, in the upstream- \n\ndownstream direction. Analysis of Figure 6.37 leads to the following conclusions: \n\n- in normal operating conditions, the decrease in the layers\u2019 permeability leads to a \n\ngreater loss of hydraulic head where the area of higher permeability upstream from the \n\ndam meets the layer upstream of the drains (line a); \n\n- when drain D25 D is closed, a decrease in the layers permeability leads to a greater \n\nloss of hydraulic head and, consequently, to a lower hydraulic head at the drain. \n\nResults lead to the conclusion that changing the permeability of the horizontal layers upstream \n\nfrom the drains has a large effect on drain discharges and a lesser effect on pressures when the \n\ndrain is closed. \n\n \n\n \n\nHorizontal layers \n\nupstream from \n\nthe drains \n\npermeability  \n\n(\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s) \n\nDischarge \n\n(l/min) \n\nAverage \n\ndischarge \n\n((l/min)/m) \n\nWater \n\npressure \n\nat drain\u2019s  \n\nD25 D \n\nhead (bar) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\nD24 D D25 D D26 D \n\nW\na\nte\n\nr \nfl\n\no\nw\n\nin\ng\n\n i\nn\n\n a\n r\n\ne\ng\n\nu\nla\n\nr \n\nw\na\ny\n\n i\nn\n\n t\nh\n\ne\n f\n\no\nu\n\nn\nd\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \n\n2.0 - 1.32 0.07 1.06 0.47 0.02 0.18 - \n\n4.0 - 2.01 0.07 1.81 0.70 0.02 0.29 - \n\n5.0 - 2.33 0.07 2.18 0.82 0.02 0.34 - \n\n6.0 - 2.65 0.07 2.54 0.93 0.02 0.39 - \n\n8.0 - 3.25 0.07 3.27 1.15 0.02 0.50 - \n\n10.0 - 3.82 0.07 3.98 1.37 0.02 0.60 - \n\n15.0 - 5.15 0.07 5.72 1.91 0.02 0.86 - \n\n 20.0 - 6.38 0.07 7.42 2.44 0.02 1.10 - \n\nD\nra\n\nin\n D\n\n2\n5\n\n D\n c\n\nlo\nse\n\nd\n \n\n2.0 - 0.96 0.13 - 0.99 0.05 0.13 3.61 \n\n4.0 - 1.35 0.14 - 1.55 0.05 0.18 4.06 \n\n5.0 - 1.53 0.15 - 1.82 0.05 0.22 4.18 \n\n6.0 - 1.70 0.15 - 2.08 0.05 0.25 4.27 \n\n8.0 - 2.03 0.15 - 2.61 0.05 0.31 4.39 \n\n10.0 - 2.35 0.15 - 3.13 0.05 0.37 4.46 \n\n15.0 - 3.10 0.16 - 4.42 0.06 0.50 4.55 \n\n 20.0 - 3.79 0.16 - 5.69 0.06 0.65 4.59 \n\nTable 6.25 - Numerical discharges and water pressures for different permeability values of the \n\nhorizontal layers upstream from the drains, in normal operating conditions and with drain \n\nD25 D closed. \n\n\n\n 255 \n\nD25 D - influence of rock mass permeability\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nHorizontal layers' permeability   (x 10\n-7\n\n m/s)\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nb\na\n\nr\n)\n\n  discharge in drain D24 D   discharge in drain D25 D\n\n  discharge in drain D26 D   discharge in drain D24 D when drain D25 D is closed\n\n discharge in drain D26 D when drain D25 D is closed   water pressure at drain D25 D when closed\n\nnumerical results with the \n\nmodel for drain D25 D\n\n \n\nFigure 6.36 \u2013 Variation of discharges in each drain and in the water pressure at drain D25 D \n\nwhen closed, with the different permeability values for the horizontal layers upstream from \n\nthe drains. \n\n \nD25D - Potencial ao longo de uma linha horizontal (com 40 m) que intersecta o dreno, a meia altura \n\nda camada mais perme\u00e1vel a montante do dreno\n\n60.0\n\n70.0\n\n80.0\n\n90.0\n\n100.0\n\n110.0\n\n120.0\n\n130.0\n\n140.0\n\n150.0\n\n-15.0-10.0-5.00.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.0\n\nMesh coordinate in the upstream-downstream direction (m)\n\nH\ny\n\nd\nr\na\n\nu\nli\n\nc\n h\n\ne\na\nd\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n main model (1)  main model (2)\n\n k horizontal layers upstream from the drains = 2 LU (1)  k horizontal layers upstream from the drains = 2 LU (2)\n \n\nFigure 6.37 - Variations in hydraulic head along a horizontal line 40 m long that crosses drain \n\nD25 D in the upstream-downstream direction in the main model and in a model where the \n\npermeability of the horizontal layers upstream from the drains is 2.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. \n\ndrain \n\n(1) Normal operating conditions \n\n(2) Drain D25 D closed \n\na) \n\na) the horizontal line meets the layer of higher \n\npermeability upstream from the drain \n\n\n\n   256 \n\n6.5.6 Influence of the width of higher permeability layers upstream from the \n\ndrains  \n\nThe influence of the width of the higher permeability layers upstream from the drains was \n\nassessed carrying out a numerical analysis in which layers\u2019 width was gradually increased \n\n(Figure 6.38): \n\n- firstly, it was assumed that there was no layer of higher permeability (Figure 6.38 a);  \n\n- secondly, the layer\u2019s width upstream from drain D25 D was increased by 1.0 m for \n\nthree times, until the distance between drains was reached (Figure 6.38 b, c and d);  \n\n- thirdly, the layer width upstream from drain D26 D (the layer at drain D26 D is 2.0 m \n\nhigher than the layer at drain D25 D) was increased by 0.5 m for three times, until \n\nhalf-distance between drains was reached (main model) (Figure 6.38 e, f and g); \n\n- Finally, it was assumed that the layer at drain D26 D was 3.0 m wide, the distance \n\nbetween drains, and that there was also a layer upstream from drain D24 D. \n\nResults are shown in Table 6.26 and Figure 6.39. Results analysis show that discharges and \n\nwater pressure in drain D25 D when closed increase gradually as the layer upstream from \n\ndrain D25 D becomes larger. Discharge increase is greater in drain D25 D, which is crossed \n\nby the layer. Increases in both discharges and water pressure also occur as the width of the \n\nlayer upstream from drain D26 D increases, until the seepage path crosses drain D26 D. When \n\nthe latter is crossed by the layer: i) there is an increase in the quantity of water in drain D26 D, \n\nboth in normal operating conditions and with drain D25 D closed; ii) a slight decrease in the \n\nquantity of water in drain D25 D; and iii) a great loss of water pressure in drain D25 D when \n\nclosed. Therefore, the widths of the higher permeability layers upstream from the drains used \n\nin the final model allow a good match of the distribution of discharges to the drains in the two \n\nsimulated situations. Even small variations in widths lead to results that do not correspond to \n\nreadings taken while carrying out the tests.  \n\nThe study carried out leads to the conclusion that in this area of Alqueva dam foundation, \n\nwhich is an area of low permeability, drainage is crucial for controlling water pressures as \n\ndiscontinuities with a very small aperture are never grouted. \n\n \n\n\n\n 257 \n\n   \n\na) no layer of higher \n\npermeability upstream from the \n\ndrains. \n\nb) 1 m wide layer upstream from \n\ndrain D25 D. \n\nc) 2 m wide layer upstream from \n\ndrain D25 D. \n\n   \n\nd) 3 m wide layer upstream from \n\ndrain D25 D. \n\ne) 3 m wide layer upstream from \n\ndrain D25 D and 0.5 m wide \n\nlayer upstream from drain \n\nD26 D.  \n\nf) 3 m wide layer upstream from \n\ndrain D25 D and 1.0 m wide \n\nlayer upstream from drain \n\nD26 D. \n\n   \n\ng) 3 m wide layer upstream from \n\ndrain D25 D and 1.5 m wide \n\nlayer upstream from drain \n\nD26 D (main model). \n\nh) 3 m wide layers upstream \n\nfrom drains D25 D and D26 D. \n\ni) 3 m wide layers upstream \n\nfrom drains D24 D, D25 D and \n\nD26 D (total width = 9 m). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.38 \u2013 Models with different widths of the horizontal layers upstream from the drains. \n\n \n\n\n\n   258 \n\n \n\nLayers\u2019  \n\nwidth \n\n(m) \n\nDischarge \n\n(l/min) \n\nAverage \n\ndischarge \n\n((l/min)/m) \n\nWater \n\npressure \n\nat drain  \n\nD25 D\u2019s \n\nhead (bar) \n\nupstream drain downstream \n\nD24 D D25 D D26 D \n\nN\no\n\nrm\na\nl \n\no\np\n\ne\nra\n\nti\nn\n\ng\n c\n\no\nn\n\nd\nit\n\nio\nn\n\ns \n\n0.0 - 0.55 0.05 0.31 0.21 0.02 0.06 - \n\n1.0 - 1.12 0.04 0.94 0.20 0.02 0.13 - \n\n2.0 - 1.51 0.05 1.34 0.20 0.02 0.18 - \n\n3.0 - 2.11 0.07 1.92 0.22 0.02 0.25 - \n\n3.5 - 2.19 0.07 2.17 0.26 0.02 0.28 - \n\n4.0 - 2.22 0.07 2.34 0.29 0.02 0.30 - \n\n4.5 - 2.33 0.07 2.18 0.82 0.02 0.34 - \n\n6.0 - 2.60 0.07 2.23 1.68 0.02 0.44 - \n\n9.0 - 4.24 2.13 2.06 1.58 0.02 0.64 - \n\nD\nra\n\nin\n D\n\n2\n5\n\n D\n c\n\nlo\nse\n\nd\n \n\n0.0 - 0.48 0.08 - 0.40 0.04 0.05 2.22 \n\n1.0 - 0.71 0.12 - 0.59 0.05 0.08 4.03 \n\n2.0 - 0.83 0.15 - 0.73 0.06 0.10 4.62 \n\n3.0 - 0.96 0.18 - 0.77 0.06 0.11 5.34 \n\n3.5 - 0.97 0.18 - 0.86 0.06 0.12 5.48 \n\n4.0 - 0.97 0.19 - 0.91 0.07 0.12 5.59 \n\n4.5 - 1.53 0.15 - 1.82 0.05 0.22 4.18 \n\n6.0 - 1.93 0.14 - 2.82 0.05 0.33 3.84 \n\n9.0 - 3.72 2.71 - 2.33 0.04 0.56 2.94 \n \n\nTable 6.26 - Numerical discharges and water pressures for different widths of the horizontal \n\nlayers upstream from the drains, in normal operating conditions and with drain D25 D closed. \n\n\n\n 259 \n\nD25 D - influence of rock mass permeability\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0\n\nWidth of higher permeability layers   (m)\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nb\na\n\nr\n)\n\n  discharge in drain D24 D   discharge in drain D25 D\n\n  discharge in drain D26 D   discharge in drain D24 D when drain D25 D is closed\n\n discharge in drain D26 D when drain D25 D is closed   water pressure at drain D25 D when closed\n\nnumerical results with the \n\nmodel for drain D25 D\n\n \n\nFigure 6.39 \u2013 Variation of discharges in each drain and in the water pressure at drain D25 D \n\nwhen closed, with different widths of the higher permeability layers upstream from the drains. \n\n6.5.7 Influence of total or partial clogging of drain D24 D \n\nField results showed that drain D24 D was obstructed at elevation 54.67 m but there is no way \n\nof knowing how far the blockage extends.

Parameter analysis carried out led to the conclusion that \n\nthe model for drain D25 D is only slightly affected by variations in both the grout curtain \n\npermeability and in the hydraulic conductivity of the more pervious area upstream from the \n\ndam, as long as it is much greater than that of the rock mass. It was also concluded that \n\nknowing whether drain D24 D was totally or only partially obstructed was not relevant. \n\nHowever, the model is highly sensitive to increase in rock mass equivalent permeability, \n\nwhich leads to a non-realistic situation, with larger quantities of water flowing into the drains \n\nat their lower areas. Drain discharges are also highly affected by changes in the permeability \n\nof the horizontal layers upstream from the drains. The widths of these layers are also essential \n\nparameters, as recorded water pressures and discharges could only be obtained with the \n\nwidths adopted. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 261 \n\n6.6 Global three-dimensional hydraulic model \n\nResults of tests carried out in situ, presented in chapter 4.5, and conclusions drawn from the \n\ndetailed 3D models, presented in the previous sections, were used to develop a global \n\nhydraulic model of the foundation. In this type of model, due to the size of the area being \n\nstudied, the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones is much greater than the ones \n\nemployed in the previous section, and it is often necessary to simulate the drainage system in \n\na simplified way. As mentioned in chapter 5, the drainage system can be simulated by a \n\nhypothetical continuous trench with the same depth as the drains.  \n\nFor application to arch dams, special routines for concrete arch dam analysis are included in \n\n3DEC code (Lemos 1996; 1998; 1999a) which allow the adequate geometric fitting of the \n\nconcrete structure, represented by finite element blocks, and the rock mass in the foundation, \n\nrepresented by regular polyhedral deformable blocks. The FE mesh of the dam arch is first \n\ncreated, usually using suitable pre-processing software, and is represented by one or more \n\nblocks and formed by 20-noded isoparametric brick elements. These finite elements, of an \n\norder higher than the foundation tetrahedra, allow the modelling of the curved arch geometry \n\nand provide a good approximation of the bending behaviour of concrete arches, even with \n\nonly one element across the thickness. When the dam is represented by a group of blocks, the \n\nmovement of the contraction joints can be taken into account. When only one element across \n\nthe dam\u2019s thickness is used, there are only three grid contact points across the shell thickness, \n\nand the stress distribution is not very accurate. Meshes with more than one element across the \n\nthickness allow a better simulation not only of contact stresses but also of uplift distribution in \n\nthe concrete/rock mass interface. Therefore, a dam-foundation system can be analysed in a \n\nmore accurate and efficient way than would be possible with the uniform stress tetrahedral \n\nelements employed in the standard deformable blocks available in 3DEC (Lemos 1998; \n\nResende et al. 2004). \n\n6.6.1 Model description \n\nThe hydraulic foundation rock mass model was developed in various steps taking into account \n\nthe mesh of Alqueva dam, shown in Figure 6.40, and the existence of both the grout and \n\ndrainage curtains. The methodology used in model development is presented. Although 3DEC \n\ncode was used, the methodology could easily be applied with other computer codes. The FE \n\nmesh of Alqueva dam arch, with two elements across the thickness, was created outside \n\n3DEC by a code developed at LNEC (Batista 1998). Figure 6.41 shows the modelling steps. \n\nIn this figure, the curved finite element faces that compose the dam are divided into triangular \n\nfaces, in order to simplify the graphical representation. \n\n\n\n   262 \n\nIn the first modelling step, the blocks under the dam are created with one of their faces \n\nadjacent to the foundation surface of the FE mesh (Figure 6.41 a). As the faces of the \n\nfoundation surface may be curved, it is first necessary to set the nodes along the edges of \n\ncontact faces exactly at the midpoint of the edges, so that they can fit the polyhedral \n\nfoundation blocks (Itasca 2003). Each element\u2019s foundation surface is divided into eight \n\ntriangles, by including an extra grid-point at the centre of the element face. Five blocks are \n\ncreated under each foundation surface, as shown in Figure 6.42. Blocks under the dam go \n\ndown to elevation 0.0. Then these blocks are cut in order to define the drainage length. \n\nDifferent colours represent different region numbers. After cutting the foundation, the same \n\nregion number is given to blocks below the cut. The drainage curtain is simulated by a \n\nhypothetical continuous trench and was defined cutting the upstream upper blocks mid-way \n\nalong vertical planes. In this way, the drainage curtain is defined about 10 m downstream \n\nfrom the upstream edge. \n\nIn the second and third modelling steps, blocks upstream and downstream from the dam are \n\ncreated taking into account the upstream and downstream edges (Figure 6.41 b and c). To \n\napply boundary conditions at an appropriate distance from the dam, the model was extended \n\nto a length of 475 m in the upstream-downstream direction. Figure 6.41 c) shows the different \n\nblocks created upstream from the dam, where the grout curtain is represented in red. In order \n\nto simplify the model, the grout curtain is modelled adjacent to the upstream edge, not \n\nunderneath the dam itself. Foundation blocks are afterwards cut at a distance of about 35 m \n\nupstream and downstream from the dam in order to define finer meshes in the areas close to \n\nthe dam. \n\nFinally, the model is extended laterally and downwards, with brick shape blocks, in order to \n\ncreate a model large enough for the boundaries not to have an influence on numerical results. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the foundation mesh is automatically created by 3DEC, given the \n\naverage dimension of the tetrahedral zones. In the model shown in Figure 6.41 d) the dam is \n\nrepresented by a mesh of 30 blocks and the rock mass by 1443 blocks. The new version of the \n\n3DEC code used in this study allows the analysis of steady-state flow using an equivalent \n\ncontinuum model in tetrahedral zoned blocks, but not in FE blocks. Therefore, the dam, which \n\nwas essential to create the foundation model, had to be deleted in the global hydraulic model. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 263 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.40 \u2013 Downstream and upstream views of the 20-node finite element mesh of \n\nAlqueva dam. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na) Rock blocks below concrete/foundation interface b) Foundation blocks downstream from the dam. \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  1.115E+01\n        3.400E+01\n       -8.750E+01\ncut-pl. 0.000E+00\nmag =      2.00  \ncycle         0\n\n11-Mar-08  17:14\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nc) Foundation blocks upstream from the dam      \n\n(view and cross section). \n\nd) Perspective of the hydraulic foundation model \n\nFigure 6.41 \u2013 Modelling steps, using 3DEC\u2019s Arch Dam Module. \n\n\n\n   264 \n\nA very coarse mesh was first created, in which the average edge lengths of the tetrahedral \n\nzones were: i) 6.0 m in the blocks surrounding the drainage curtain; ii) 10.0 m in the vicinity \n\nof the above-mentioned blocks, including the grout curtain area; iii) 15.0 m in areas close to \n\nthe dam in the upstream and downstream direction (shown in light blue in Figure 6.41 b and \n\nc; and iv) 30.0 m in the remaining rock mass. The mesh, with 40595 grid-points and divided \n\ninto 64277 tetrahedra, is shown in Figure 6.43 a). Because the edges of the tetrahedral zones \n\nin the model\u2019s outer blocks are so long, the phreatic surface is not clearly identified in the \n\nresults\u2019 graphical representation, thus a finer mesh was created in which the average lengths \n\nof the tetrahedral zones are about two thirds of those assumed in the very large mesh (4.0 m, \n\n8.0 m, 12.0 m and 20.0 m instead of 6.0 m, 10.0 m, 15.0 m and 30.0 m, respectively). This \n\nsecond mesh, which was used in subsequent analysis, has 67413 grid-points and is divided \n\ninto 139397 zones (Figure 6.43 b). \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.42 \u2013 Generation of polyhedral blocks (left) matching FE block faces (right). \n\n \n\n  \n\na) Coarse mesh b) Fine mesh \n\nFigure 6.43 \u2013 Internal mesh of the global foundation model. \n\n\n\n 265 \n\n6.6.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions \n\nNumerical analysis was carried out using the water levels recorded in October 2006, while \n\ncarrying out the first borehole water-inflow tests, with the reservoir at an elevation of 143.6 m \n\nand water downstream from the dam-wall at an elevation of 81.95 m. At the drainage curtain, \n\nthe hydraulic head in each block was assumed to be equal to the average elevation of the \n\ndrains\u2019 head. \n\nIn the 3DEC models presented thus far hydraulic boundary conditions were easily applied, in \n\nareas defined by coordinate ranges in the x, y and z directions. In this global model, however, \n\nit is not as easy to apply neither the upstream and downstream heads, due to surface \n\ntopography, nor the hydraulic head at the drainage curtain, due to its horizontal and vertical \n\ncurvature. A procedure was devised, using the concept of the unit normal vector to a plane, by \n\nwhich only the surfaces in contact with a) the reservoir, b) tailwater, and c) drainage curtain, \n\nwere identified. This allowed hydraulic heads to be properly applied, by allocating a different \n\nsurface region number, as allowed by 3DEC, to each set a), b), and c).  \n\nUnlike the detailed analysis of seepage presented in the previous sections where flow took \n\nplace in the upstream-downstream direction through a confined medium, here seepage flow is \n\nnot confined as there is a water table in each abutment, due to the natural side-hill seepage. \n\n6.6.3 Results analysis \n\nA series of numerical experiments was carried out, with the model of which the mesh is \n\nshown in Figure 6.43 b), in order to obtain numerical discharges in the foundation of each \n\ndam block close to those observed. These experiments led to the conclusion that parameters \n\ndetermined using the detailed numerical models described in section 6.4 can not be used \n\ndirectly in a global 3D model of the foundation as, due to the difference in the elements\u2019 size \n\nand scale, local permeable layers and individual drains can not be represented. However, the \n\ndifferent areas identified in the detailed models can be simulated, taking into account the \n\naverage value of discharges and water pressures recorded in each block. It was assumed that \n\nthe rock mass equivalent permeability was 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s. A near-surface area of higher \n\npermeability (10 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s) was simulated upstream from the grout curtain, which \n\nencompasses the valley bottom and the base of each slope (Figure 6.44). As in the detailed \n\nmodels, horizontal layers of higher permeability between the above-mentioned near-surface \n\narea and the drainage curtain were considered in some of the dam blocks, to take into account \n\nareas where flow paths cross the drains, identified with the tests carried out in situ. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   266 \n\nThe model was first run assuming that the rock mass equivalent permeability was \n\n1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s, and that the grout curtain was 10 times less pervious. In order to represent the \n\nnear-surface area and the horizontal layers of higher permeability the model had to be cut \n\nagain. This new model has 1534 blocks, 68333 gridpoints, and is divided into 140131 \n\ntetrahedra (Figure 6.45). The new model\u00b4s mesh is slightly finer than that shown in Figure \n\n6.43 b), in the areas where cuts were made. With the above-mentioned hydraulic boundary \n\nconditions, the numerical discharge at the valley bottom is 12.47 l/min, which is about 68 % \n\nof the total discharge recorded in that area (18.42 l/min). Numerical analysis was carried out \n\nin steps, changing a parameter at a time. Table 6.28 shows, as an example, the increase in the \n\nquantity of water flowing through the model and in the foundation of block 17-18 when the \n\npermeability of different foundation areas was changed.  \n\n \n\n154\n\n130\n\n110\n\n 90\n\n 70\n\n 50\n\n 30\n\n 10\n\n(m) L.

The graphical interface used to show the \n\nresults (GID) (CIMNE 2006) only shows the hydraulic head contours on block surfaces, \n\ntherefore when the phreatic surface is below the top of the block, that block appears as a \n\nhollow space. In order to represent the hydraulic head more accurately it is necessary to show \n\ncuts, as in Figure 6.48. In this figure part of the drainage curtain is visible in the cut \n\nperpendicular to the main river channel. \n\nWith the aim of comparing numerical water pressures with those recorded in the foundation \n\nof block 17-18, when drains D21 D to D26 D were closed simultaneously, presented in \n\nsection 4.5.8.3, the model was run once more, this time assuming the same hydraulic head on \n\nthe surfaces which simulate the drainage curtain in the foundation of the above-mentioned \n\nblock, as if there were a hypothetical continuous piezometric trench, and preventing water \n\nfrom flowing out of this trench. The hydraulic head on these surfaces is the average drain \n\nhead\u2019s elevation in block 17-18. In the 3DEC code, this is simulated by linking all the \n\ngridpoints located on the surfaces which define the \u201cpiezometric trench\u201d, for all the gridpoints \n\non those surfaces to have the same hydraulic head. \n\nThe in situ tests were carried out with the reservoir at around 148.0 m and the tailwater at \n\n81.6 m. When drains D21 D to D26 D were closed simultaneously, water pressures of 0.275 \n\nto 5.6 bar were recorded in drains and piezometers located in the foundation of block 17-18, \n\nwith an average of 2.30 bar. This average water pressure was around 27 % of the hydraulic \n\nhead. With the global 3D hydraulic model and with the previously mentioned water levels, the \n\nhead at the drainage curtain in the foundation of block 17-18 is 88.10 m, which is 32 % of the \n\nhydraulic head. The numerical hydraulic head is very close to that recorded, and therefore it \n\ncan be concluded that the simplified global hydraulic model here presented can provide mean \n\nwater pressures and flow rates for each dam foundation block. \n\n\n\n 271 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHydraulic \n\nhead (m) \n\nFigure 6.47 \u2013 Hydraulic head contours (m) in the global hydraulic model of Alqueva dam \n\nfoundation (for Hu = 143.6 m; Hd = 81.95 m). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHydraulic \n\nhead (m) \n\nFigure 6.48 \u2013 Hydraulic head contours (m) in three cuts parallel and in one cut perpendicular \n\nto the main river channel, shown in their relative positions (for Hu = 143.6 m; Hd = 81.95 m). \n\n\n\n   272 \n\n6.7 Hydromechanical interaction in the foundation of Alqueva dam \n\n6.7.1 Introduction \n\nIn the previous section, seepage was analysed using a global 3D model of the dam foundation. \n\nIn this model it was assumed that there is an area of higher permeability upstream from the \n\ndam, in the valley bottom and at the base of each slope (between dam vertical joints 6 to 21 as \n\nshown in Figure 6.44), and horizontal layers of higher permeability between the upstream area \n\nand the drainage curtain, upstream from, and underneath, some of the dam blocks located in \n\nthe mentioned area. Numerical analysis was carried out assuming water levels recorded in \n\nOctober 2006, in the week in which the first borehole water-inflow tests were done. \n\nComparisons made afterwards between numerical and recorded discharges led to the \n\nconclusion that the apertures of the discontinuities through which water flows vary with \n\nchanges in reservoir level. Therefore, based on the results of borehole water-inflow tests, \n\npresented in chapter 4, and on available field data, an attempt was made to estimate the \n\nrelation between stress and permeability. \n\nThe hydromechanical interaction in the foundation of Alqueva dam was studied taking into \n\naccount the results of the hydraulic model described in the previous section and of a \n\nmechanical model developed afterwards, which is going to be presented in section 6.7.3. \n\nUncoupled hydraulic and mechanical analyses were carried out independently, and curves \n\nbetween stress and permeability were established taking into account recorded discharges in \n\nthe foundation of each dam block and total stresses obtained with the mechanical model.  \n\nThe main aim of the study is to develop a methodology which can be used to establish rules \n\nwhich, from a hydraulic model calibrated for specific reservoir and tailwater levels, allow the \n\ncalculation of discharges for other reservoir levels. These rules, that directly relate the \n\npermeability with the state of stress, can be established taking into account either effective or \n\ntotal stresses. In the study presented here mechanical analysis was carried out without taking \n\ninto account water pressures and therefore total stresses were obtained. If the effective stress \n\nhad been considered, different curves would be obtained, which, however, should lead to \n\nresults equivalent to those obtained. From a theoretical point of view, because water flows \n\nthrough the foundation, it would be more correct to consider the mechanical actions of the \n\nwater, and the effective stress rather than the total stress. However, in this case of Alqueva \n\ndam, as is going to be confirmed, vertical fissures open in the foundation close to the heel of \n\nthe dam and flow through the conductive discontinuities is mainly horizontal. Therefore, in \n\nthis case, it can be assumed that vertical stresses are not affected by seepage forces. Effective \n\nstresses are relevant for the safety assessment, in which what really matters is the water \n\npressure at the base of the dam or in sub-horizontal discontinuities close to the base. This \n\nissue is going to be addressed in the following chapter. \n\n\n\n 273 \n\nThis section describes the study carried out in order to establish a relation between stress and \n\npermeability in some areas of Alqueva dam foundation. Firstly, the results of the comparisons \n\nwhich led to this study are presented, followed by a description of the numerical mechanical \n\nmodel developed in order to estimate the aperture of vertical discontinuities within the rock \n\nmass close to the heel of the dam and to assess stresses in the foundation rock mass. The \n\nresults of this model are analysed and compared with field data. The section then goes on to \n\nshow how relationships between the permeability of the horizontal layers, which simulate \n\nwater conductive joints, and the average vertical stresses in the same areas can be established. \n\nIn addition, an attempt is made to establish a relation between local rock mass deformability \n\nand permeability. In the last part of this section, assumptions and simplifications made during \n\nanalysis are discussed. Finally, a brief summary and the main conclusions of the study are \n\npresented. \n\n6.7.2 Comparison of numerical and recorded discharges with the reservoir at \ndifferent elevations \n\nThe global model of the dam foundation referred to in the previous section was calibrated for \n\nthe reservoir at an elevation of 143.6 m and water downstream from the dam-wall at an \n\nelevation of 81.95 m. The same model was used to determine the total discharges in each arch \n\nblock with the reservoir at different elevations, corresponding to the various water level stages \n\nduring the controlled first filling of the reservoir: \n\n- around 115.0 m, recorded on 18 September 2002 (stabilizing level 1 (NE1)); \n\n- around 130.0 m, recorded on 6 February 2003 (P1); \n\n- around 143.5 m, recorded on 21 January 2004 (P2); and \n\n- around 150.0 m, recorded on 28 February 2007 (stabilizing level 2 (NE2)). \n\nOn the first three mentioned dates, tailwater level was around 74.8 m. From 28 October 2005, \n\nthe first filling of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o reservoir increased Alqueva\u2019s tailwater level, which was 81.95 m \n\non 16 October 2006, in the week when the first water-inflow tests were carried out, and \n\n81.2 m on 28 February 2007.  \n\nComparisons between recorded and numerical discharges for the different water levels, shown \n\nin Figure 6.49, lead to the conclusion that, in the area being studied, the model overestimates \n\ndischarges for water levels lower than 143.6 m and underestimates discharges for water levels \n\nhigher than that. In fact, this is observed in every block with only a few exceptions: numerical \n\ndischarges are lower than those recorded on 6 February 2003 in dam block 14-15 and on 21 \n\nJanuary 2004 in dam blocks 8-9, 9-10 and 14-15; and are higher than those recorded on 28 \n\nFebruary 2007 in dam blocks 13-14 and 17-18. \n\n\n\n   274 \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDam vertical joint\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\nnumerical discharge (homogeneous rock mass)  numerical discharge (heterogeneous rock mass)  recorded discharge\n\n 25    24    23    22    21   20   19    18    17   16    15   14    13    12    11   10     9      8      7     6      5      4      3     2      1   \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDam vertical joint\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\nnumerical discharge (homogeneous rock mass)  numerical discharge (heterogeneous rock mass)  recorded discharge\n\n 25    24    23    22    21   20   19    18    17   16    15   14    13    12    11   10     9      8      7     6      5      4      3     2      1   \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDam vertical joint\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\nnumerical discharge (homogeneous rock mass)  numerical discharge (heterogeneous rock mass)  recorded discharge\n\n 25    24    23    22    21   20   19    18    17   16    15   14    13    12    11   10     9      8      7     6      5      4      3     2      1   \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDam vertical joint\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\nnumerical discharge (homogeneous rock mass)  numerical discharge (heterogeneous rock mass)  recorded discharge\n\n 25    24    23    22    21   20   19    18    17   16    15   14    13    12    11   10     9      8      7     6      5      4      3     2      1  \n\n \n\n18 September 2002: Hu = 115.45 m \n\nHd = 74.8 m \n\n     6 February 2003: Hu = 132.17 m \n\nHd = 74.8 m \n\n     21 January 2004: Hu = 143.5 m \n\nHd = 74.8 m \n\n   28 February 2007: Hu = 150.0 m \n\nHd = 81.2 m \n\n \n\nFigure 6.49 \u2013 Recorded discharges in the foundation of each dam block and comparison with \n\nnumerical results for different water levels (numerical model calibrated for the reservoir at \n\n143.6 m and tailwater at 81.95 m; Hu \u2013 reservoir level; Hd \u2013 tailwater level). \n\n\n\n 275 \n\nResults of numerical analysis carried out for the water levels recorded on 18 September 2002 \n\nshow that discharges obtained with the homogeneous foundation model are higher than \n\nrecorded discharges in every dam block, therefore the model can not be employed for the \n\nlower water levels in the reservoir. \n\nFigure 6.50 shows numerical discharges in the foundation of each dam block for the various \n\nreservoir levels.

Figure analysis \n\nalso shows that almost the same results are obtained for the water levels recorded in January \n\n2004 and October 2006, which leads to the conclusion that the tailwater level has very little \n\ninfluence. \n\n \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDam vertical joint\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n 25    24    23   22    21    20   19   18    17    16   15    14    13    12    11   10     9     8      7     6      5      4      3     2      1   25   24   23  22   21  20  19   18  17   16  15   14   13   12   11  10    9     8    7     6    5     4     3    2     1  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.50 \u2013 Numerical discharges in the foundation of each dam block for different \n\nreservoir levels (Hu \u2013 reservoir level; Hd \u2013 tailwater level). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nDam vertical joint\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n  September 2002 Hu = 115.45 m; Hd = 74.80 m \n\n  February 2003    Hu = 132.17 m; Hd = 74.8 m\n\n  January 2004      Hu = 143.5 m; Hd = 74.8 m  \n\n  October 2006     Hu = 143.6 m; Hd = 81.95 m\n\n  February 2007    Hu = 150.1 m; Hd = 81.2 m  \n\n 25    24    23   22    21    20   19   18    17    16   15    14    13    12    11   10     9     8      7     6      5      4      3     2      1   25   24   23  22   21  20  19   18  17   16  15   14   13   12   11  10    9     8    7     6    5     4     3    2     1  \n\n\n\n   276 \n\n6.7.3 Numerical mechanical model \n\n6.7.3.1 Model description \n\nThe model used to carry out mechanical analysis is geometrically similar to the hydraulic \n\nmodel presented in the previous chapter. However, unlike the above mentioned model, which \n\nonly includes the foundation, the mechanical model of the dam-foundation system requires \n\nthat not only the dam be represented but also the location of fault 22, in order to simulate the \n\narea of lower modulus of elasticity, where the phyllite occurs. Phyllite deformability is \n\nassumed above the lower wall of the fault and green schist deformability in the remaining \n\nrock mass. Fault 22 is assumed to be 10 m wide. The model is shown in Figure 6.51.  \n\nThe dam is simulated by a group of finite element elastic blocks separated by joints, which \n\nrepresent vertical contraction joints. In the foundation a joint is assumed at the dam/rock mass \n\ninterface (\u201cfoundation joint\u201d), and, as the grout curtain is simulated adjacent to the upstream \n\nedge, two hypothetical joints were assumed between the grout curtain and the rock mass, at \n\nthe upstream and downstream faces of the grout curtain, respectively (\u201cgrout curtain/rock \n\ninterface\u201d), so as to estimate the aperture of discontinuities in the uppermost strata of the \n\nfoundation. The grout curtain/rock interface is considered only between dam joints 6 to 21, \n\ncorresponding to the location of the area of higher permeability upstream from the dam \n\nassumed in the global hydraulic model of the dam foundation (Figure 6.44). \n\nThe rock mass, assumed to be isotropic, is represented by 2178 deformable blocks, internally \n\ndivided into 143881 zones. The average edge lengths of the tetrahedral zones are the same as \n\nthose used in the hydraulic model (4.0 m in the blocks surrounding the drainage curtain, 8.0 m \n\nin the vicinity of the above mentioned blocks, including the grout curtain area, 12.0 m in the \n\nareas close to the dam in the upstream and downstream direction, and 20.0 m in the remaining \n\nrock mass). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 277 \n\na) \n\n \n\nb) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.51 - Global mechanical model: perspective (a) and cross section (b). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFault 22 \n\nGreen schist \n\nPhyllite \n\nConcrete \n\nFault 22 (phyllite \n\nproperties assumed) \n\ngrout curtain \n\nFoundation joint \n\ndrainage curtain  grout curtain/rock interface \n\n785 m \n\n240 m \n\n475 m \n\n\n\n   278 \n\n6.7.3.2 Material properties \n\nMaterial and joint properties are shown in Table 6.31 and Table 6.32. Both dam concrete and \n\nfoundation rock mass, as well as the dam contraction joints, are assumed to follow elastic \n\nlinear behaviour. Foundation joint and grout curtain/rock interface are assigned a Mohr-\n\nCoulomb constitutive model.  \n\nDam Young\u2019s modulus is assumed to be 20 GPa. The existence of contraction joints leads to \n\nan increase in the dam\u00b4s deformability which, in practice, is difficult to quantify. When \n\nmodelling, if the dam is simulated as a single block, dam Young\u2019s modulus is usually \n\nadjusted in such a way that numerical results already include the effect of joint deformability. \n\nWhen the dam is simulated as a group of blocks separated by joints, deformability properties \n\nof both concrete and joints have to be adjusted to match the whole structure\u2019s deformability. \n\nIn order to have a measure of the effect of these joint stiffnesses it is possible to define a \n\nfictitious equivalent width of concrete which has the same deformability of the joint. This \n\nequivalent width (e) is given by: \n\nn\nk\n\nE\ne ?  \n\n(6.7) \n\nTherefore, in this case, a joint normal stiffness (kn) of 10 GPa/m corresponds to the \n\nassumption that vertical contraction joints have a width of 2 m of material identical to dam \n\nconcrete. Joint widths of 0.5 to 2 m of material identical to dam concrete are normally used in \n\n3D analysis of dams behaviour (Lemos et al. 2006; Pina et al. 2006). A ratio of 0.5 is assumed \n\nbetween normal and shear stiffnesses (kn = 10 GPa/m and ks = 5 GPa/m).  \n\nContraction joints were injected with the dam concrete at temperatures lower than 10\u00b0C, with \n\nthe joints quite wide open, in order to ensure that, once injection was concluded, the dam \n\nwould behave as a monolithic block. Analysis of recorded joint movements with the reservoir \n\nat different levels higher than 112 m shows that the opening and closure of joints is lower \n\nthan 0.5 mm, which is within jointmeter\u2019s accuracy (LNEC 2008), therefore the joints can be \n\nconsidered closed. The only exceptions are the joints which link the arch to both gravity \n\nstructures, in the right and left banks (joints 1 and 25), in which apertures up to 1.5 mm were \n\nrecorded in jointmeters located close to the downstream face of the dam, on dates when the \n\ntemperature was very low. As the dam joints are closed, the assumption of joint elastic \n\nbehaviour is justified. \n\nIt is assumed that rock mass Young\u2019s modulus is 10 GPa where schist occurs and that the \n\nphyllite area is two times more deformable. Grout curtain properties are the same as those in \n\nthe rock mass foundation, either schist or phyllite. \n\n\n\n 279 \n\nFoundation joint and grout curtain/rock interface properties were changed during numerical \n\nanalysis, as shown in Table 6.32. Firstly, the model was run until equilibrium, assuming \n\nelastic behaviour (Model 1). Two non-linear analyses were afterwards carried out: in Model 2, \n\nnon-linear behaviour of grout curtain/rock interface was assumed, with a friction angle of 35\u00b0 \n\nand zero cohesion and tensile strength at this interface; in Model 3, the above-mentioned joint \n\nproperties were assumed not only at the grout curtain/rock interface but also at the upstream \n\narea of the foundation joint (in the valley bottom, between dam joints 8 to 18, the upstream \n\narea of the foundation joint simulates the peripheral joint at the heel of the blocks, introduced \n\nto avoid stresses with the filling of the reservoir, as shown in Figure 4.9). \n\nIn 3DEC, the way to simulate elastic continuity at the interfaces, shear and tensile strength \n\nbeing prevented, is to assign very high cohesion and tensile strength to the interfaces. \n\nTherefore, in Model 1, cohesion and tensile strength were assigned 10\n20\n\n GPa at both \n\ninterfaces. In Model 2 this value was only assigned to the foundation joint.  \n\nAs shown in Table 6.32, in Models 2 and 3, joints assumed to have non-linear behaviour were \n\nassigned zero tensile strength and zero cohesion. Assigning a zero tensile strength allows the \n\ninterfaces to open in areas where tensile stresses occur. With a shear strength defined by \n\ncohesion zero and an assumed friction angle, only friction prevents interfaces from sliding. \n\n \n\nMaterial Density Young\u00b4s modulus (E) Poisson\u2019s ratio \n (kg/m\n\n3\n) (GPa) - \n\nDam 2400 20 0.2 \n\nRock mass    \n\n   green schist 2650 10 0.2 \n\n   phyllite 2650 5 0.2 \n\nGrout curtain    \n\n   in the green schist area 2650 10 0.2 \n\n   in the phyllite area 2650 5 0.2 \n\nTable 6.31 \u2013 Material properties. \n\n \n\nModel Normal \n\nstiffness \n\nkn \n\nShear \n\nstiffness \n\nks \n\nFriction \n\nangle \n\n? \n\nCohesion \n\n \n\nc \n\n (GPa/m) (GPa/m) (\u00ba) (MPa) \n\nModel 1: elastic 10 5 all joints with elastic \n\nbehaviour \n\nModel 2: non-linear behaviour of grout curtain/rock \n\ninterface \n\n10 5 35\u00ba 0 \n\nModel 3: non-linear behaviour of both upstream area \n\nof the foundation joint and grout curtain/rock interface \n\n10 5 35\u00ba 0 \n\nTable 6.32 \u2013 Joint mechanical properties in each of the three different models. \n\n\n\n   280 \n\n6.7.3.3 Sequence of analysis \n\nDam and foundation displacements and stresses were obtained in a simplified way \n\nconsidering three successive loading stages:  \n\ni) in situ stresses due to the weight of the rock mass, before dam construction;  \n\nii) dam weight; and  \n\niii) hydrostatic load at various reservoir elevations.  \n\nIn the first stage, the usual procedure is to assume an approximate initial state of stress, and to \n\nobtain the in situ stresses by running the model until equilibrium, so that the determined in \n\nsitu stresses take the valley geometry into account. At this stage of the analysis, the dam and \n\nthe grout curtain have not yet been constructed, thus they should not be considered in the \n\nnumerical analysis. However, in 3DEC, all the blocks must be created before zoning them and \n\nrunning the model. In this code, the procedure to ensure that dam weight and stiffness do not \n\ninfluence in situ stresses is to assign zero gravity load to FE blocks and to assume a very low \n\ndam Young\u2019s modulus, to make the dam follow the valley deformation. Stresses due to dam \n\ndeformation are set to zero once equilibrium is reached, in order not to include these stresses \n\nin subsequent analysis. Therefore, at this stage of analysis, dam Young\u2019s modulus, which is \n\nabout 20 GPa, was assumed to be 100 times lower.  \n\nNumerical analysis started from a given hydrostatic state of stress, close to the in situ state of \n\nstress due to rock mass weight. An estimate of the initial vertical stress component was \n\nobtained, as usual, assuming that it increases with depth, due to the weight of the upper rock \n\nmass. This relationship is valid, as shown by Hoek and Brown (1980), who collated \n\nworldwide in situ stress data. There is, however, a significant amount of scatter in the \n\nmeasurements (Figure 6.52). In an elastic homogeneous media, assuming that the two \n\nhorizontal stresses are equal, this simplified hypothesis of in situ stresses due only to rock \n\nmass weight, leads to: \n\ny\nry\n\n.?? ??  (6.8) \n\nyzx\nk ??? ??\n\n \n\n(6.9) \n\n \n\nwith: \n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n1\nk  (6.10) \n\nwhere ?r is the rock mass unit weight, y is the depth below the surface of the rock mass (in the \n\n3DEC model presented here, x-axis towards the left bank; y-axis vertical; and z-axis towards \n\nupstream); and ? is the Poisson\u2019s ratio. Assuming elastic behaviour, a Poisson\u2019s ratio of 0.2 \n\n\n\n 281 \n\n(Table 6.31) corresponds to a ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses of 0.25. In practice, higher \n\nk values are observed, as shown in Figure 6.53. The same figure shows that close to the \n\nsurface readings are extremely widely scattered, but with increasing depth, the k values \n\ndecrease. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.52 \u2013 Collated worldwide in situ stress data: vertical stress components (after Hoek \n\nand Brown 1980). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.53 \u2013 Collated worldwide in situ stress data: mean horizontal stress component (after \n\nHoek and Brown 1980). \n\n\n\n   282 \n\nPrior to dam construction, direct measurements of horizontal stresses were taken using small \n\nflatjacks inserted into exposed rock surfaces, in excavated galleries (LNEC 1973). Two \n\nmeasurements were taken on the left bank, 13 and 20 m below rock mass surface and one on \n\nthe right bank, 12 m below surface, from which ratios of horizontal to vertical stresses of \n\n0.87, 0.94, and 1.26 were determined, respectively. The small amount of available data is not \n\nenough to provide useful information; therefore it was assumed that the ratio of horizontal to \n\nvertical stresses was 0.5, which is more realistic than the k value given by the elasticity \n\ntheory. \n\nIn situ stresses were determined assuming a homogeneous rock mass, with a unit weight of \n\n26.5 kN/m\n3\n and a Young\u2019s modulus of 10 GPa, assumed to be uniform in the whole \n\nfoundation. The simplest hypothesis of a homogeneous foundation was considered, and the \n\nmore deformable area where the phyllite occurs was assigned the same properties as the \n\nschistous area. It was assumed that the hydrostatic state of stress varied linearly in each valley \n\nslope, from the valley bottom to the top of both right and left banks. \n\nRegarding boundary conditions, vertical displacements at the base of the model and horizontal \n\ndisplacements perpendicular to each of the four lateral model boundaries were prevented.  \n\nThe simplifications made at this stage of analysis have little effect on numerical results, as in \n\nnear surface structures, such as dams, the effect of in situ stresses is low. \n\nIn the second stage, additional loading corresponds to dam weight, therefore real dam \n\nYoung\u2019s modulus and stiffness were assumed. Dam construction sequence was not taken into \n\naccount, and the dam weight was applied as a whole. Joints and interfaces were assumed to \n\nhave elastic behaviour. In this phase, the foundation was assumed to be more deformable \n\nabove the lower wall of fault 22, in the phyllite area. Boundary conditions were the same as \n\nthose assumed in the previous phase. As the dam weight is a vertical load, the same results are \n\nobtained with these boundary conditions as with displacements prevented at the base of the \n\nmodel and at the lateral boundaries. \n\nIn the third stage, hydrostatic loading corresponding to various reservoir levels was applied \n\nto the upstream face of the dam. Boundary conditions were changed, preventing any \n\ndisplacement at the base of the model and at the lateral boundaries. The model was first \n\nbrought to equilibrium assuming elastic behaviour. From this state of equilibrium, Models 2 \n\nand 3 were run for more steps, until convergence was achieved, as in this way interfaces were \n\nallowed to open. Once they open, stresses become zero. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 283 \n\n6.7.3.4 Results analysis \n\nFirst loading stage (in situ stresses) \n\nAt the beginning of the numerical analysis, in situ stresses due to the weight of the rock mass \n\nare obtained. Figure 6.54 shows principal stresses in tetrahedra belonging to each foundation \n\nblock, in a vertical cross section perpendicular to the valley axis (compressive stresses are \n\nnegative). Results show a realistic stress pattern, with vertical stresses increasing with depth \n\nand horizontal stresses decreasing close to the surface of the rock mass and valley slopes. \n\nSecond loading stage (dam weight) \n\nIn the second phase of analysis, influence of dam weight is assessed. Gridpoint displacements \n\nwere set to zero before cycling the system until equilibrium. Horizontal arch displacements at \n\ncrest elevation (154 m), shown in Figure 6.55, are towards upstream and are higher in the left \n\nbank because phyllite is more deformable than the green schist. Figure 6.56 shows \n\ndisplacements and principal stresses at, and underneath, the central cross section. The crest of \n\nthe central cantilever moves towards upstream, with a horizontal displacement of 9.8 mm and \n\nvertical displacement of 13.3 mm downwards. In the dam concrete, maximum compressive \n\nstresses were determined in directions close to the vertical, at the heel of the dam, and at this \n\nstage went up to 4.7 MPa. Tensile stresses in the arches were barely obtained. \n\nIn the rock mass, maximum vertical displacements were determined underneath the dam and \n\nwere higher in the left bank, because phyllite is more deformable than green schist. Maximum \n\nvertical displacements of 9.4 mm were determined. In foundation blocks below the heel of the \n\ncentral cantilever average compressive stresses of around 2.2 MPa were determined, which \n\napproximately corresponds to vertical stresses due to dam weight \n\n(2400 kg/m\n3\n \u00d7 10 m/s\n\n2\n \u00d7 96 m = 2.3 MPa). \n\nThird loading stage (hydrostatic loading) \n\nThe mechanical response of the dam/foundation system under hydrostatic loading, for \n\ndifferent reservoir levels, is obtained in the third phase of analysis. The following paragraphs \n\npresent the radial displacements at the crest of the central cantilever, normal joint \n\ndisplacements, and average vertical stresses in the foundation blocks below the dam arch \n\nwhich simulate conductive joints in the global hydraulic model of the dam foundation. \n\nGridpoint displacements were reset at the beginning of this loading stage, so the \n\ndisplacements presented are only due to hydrostatic loading.

Both figures show results of \n\nModel 1, for the highest reservoir level. Naturally, displacements are towards downstream and \n\nare slightly higher in the left bank, due to the existence of the phyllite area. The crest of the \n\ncentral cantilever moves towards downstream, with a horizontal displacement of 60.47 mm \n\nand vertical displacement of 7.32 mm downwards. In the dam concrete, maximum \n\ncompressive stresses of around 10 MPa were determined in the lower area of block 21-22, \n\nclose to the downstream face of the dam. In the central cantilever, maximum compressive \n\nstresses of around 4.5 MPa were determined not only in the lower arch area, close to the \n\ndownstream face of the dam, but also in the arch upper area. \n\nNumerical analysis with the dam simulated as a single block, without vertical joints, was \n\ncarried out and the results were compared to those obtained with the elastic model presented \n\nhere (Model 1), in which dam joints behave elastically. Displacements at the crest of the \n\ncentral cantilever for the highest reservoir level and for the various reservoir levels referred to \n\nin section 1.2, determined with both models are shown in Table 6.33. The percentage of \n\ndisplacement increase when the existence of joints is assumed is shown in brackets. It can be \n\nseen that, for the highest reservoir level, contraction joints 2 m wide of material identical to \n\ndam concrete lead to an increase of around 15 % in the numerical horizontal displacement at \n\nthe crest of the central cantilever, and of around 5 % in the vertical displacement.  \n\nTable 6.34 shows numerical radial displacements at the crest of the central cantilever for the \n\ndifferent reservoir levels, determined with the three different models (Models 1, 2 and 3). \n\nHorizontal radial displacements and vertical displacements for the various reservoir levels are \n\nshown in Figure 6.59. The non-linear behaviour of the grout curtain/rock interface and of both \n\nthe grout curtain/rock interface and foundation joint has only a slight effect on displacements, \n\nand only for the higher reservoir levels. For the highest reservoir level, a horizontal radial \n\ndisplacement at the crest of the central cantilever of around 60 mm is determined. In this case, \n\nthe horizontal radial displacement obtained with Model 1 is 98 % of that obtained with Model \n\n3, which corresponds to a difference of 1.2 mm, and the vertical displacement is 36 % higher, \n\nwhich corresponds to a difference of 1.9 mm.  \n\nDisplacement histories in both y- and z-directions monitored at different points in the rock \n\nmass upstream and downstream from the grout curtain, in a section that crosses the dam \n\ncentral cantilever in the upstream/downstream direction led to the conclusion that the grout \n\ncurtain/rock interface opens at the downstream face of the grout curtain, as shown in Figure \n\n\n\n   286 \n\n6.60. Tensile stresses below the heel of the central cantilever, due to the filling of the \n\nreservoir, lead to the opening of the interfaces, with maximum normal and shear \n\ndisplacements shown in Table 6.35 and Figure 6.36, respectively. Analysis of the results of \n\nModel 3 shows that for the highest water level grout curtain/rock interface normal \n\ndisplacement is about 1.5 up to 2.1 mm in the upper 3 m. For the same reservoir level, the \n\nfoundation joint opens about 3.4 mm close to the area where the upstream face of the dam \n\nmeets the foundation (Figure 6.60), and slides about 1.4 mm. In both models, the maximum \n\nshear displacement at the grout curtain/rock interface decreases when the reservoir level \n\nincreases from 115.5 m to 132.2 m, and gradually increases for higher reservoir levels. As \n\nshown in Figure 6.61, this is due to a change in the relative direction of movement between \n\nthe grout curtain and the surrounding rock mass, when the reservoir goes up from 132.2 m to \n\n143.6 m.    \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax Displacement =    \n  6.276E-02\n\nvector scale\n\n0  2E-01\n\n  0.000E+00  1.250E-02\n  1.250E-02  2.500E-02\n  2.500E-02  3.750E-02\n  3.750E-02  5.000E-02\n  5.000E-02  6.250E-02\n  6.250E-02  7.500E-02\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  1.250E-02 \nColor by Disp mag.   \n\ndip=    0.00 above\ndd =  180.00\ncenter  3.464E+01\n        3.400E+01\n       -8.750E+01\ncut-pl.-1.192E+02\nmag =      2.00  \ncycle     25000\n\n23-Jun-08   1:07\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  2E+02\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax Displacement =    \n  6.276E-02\n\nvector scale\n\n0  2E-01\n\n  0.000E+00  1.250E-02\n  1.250E-02  2.500E-02\n  2.500E-02  3.750E-02\n  3.750E-02  5.000E-02\n  5.000E-02  6.250E-02\n  6.250E-02  7.500E-02\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  1.250E-02 \nColor by Disp mag.   \n\ndip=    0.00 above\ndd =  180.00\ncenter  3.464E+01\n        3.400E+01\n       -8.750E+01\ncut-pl.-1.192E+02\nmag =      2.00  \ncycle     25000\n\n23-Jun-08   1:07\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  2E+02\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\nFigure 6.57 \u2013 Displacements at crest elevation (y = 154 m) due to hydrostatic loading for the \n\nreservoir at 154.0 m (highest reservoir level). \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax Displacement =    \n  6.157E-02\n\nvector scale\n\n0  2E-01\n\n  0.000E+00  1.250E-02\n  1.250E-02  2.500E-02\n  2.500E-02  3.750E-02\n  3.750E-02  5.000E-02\n  5.000E-02  6.250E-02\n  6.250E-02  7.500E-02\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  1.250E-02 \nColor by Disp mag.   \n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  3.464E+01\n        9.861E+01\n        6.472E+00\ncut-pl. 3.464E+01\nmag =      8.00  \ncycle     25000\n\n23-Jun-08   1:07\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  5E+01\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax compress. stress\n -4.461E+00\n\nvector scale\n\n0  2E+01\n\n -7.500E-01  0.000E+00\n -1.500E+00 -7.500E-01\n -2.250E+00 -1.500E+00\n -3.000E+00 -2.250E+00\n -3.750E+00 -3.000E+00\n -4.500E+00 -3.750E+00\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  7.500E-01 \nColor by PS1 mag. \n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  3.464E+01\n        9.861E+01\n        6.472E+00\ncut-pl. 3.464E+01\nmag =      8.00  \ncycle     25000\n\n23-Jun-08   1:07\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  5E+01\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax Displacement =    \n  6.157E-02\n\nvector scale\n\n0  2E-01\n\n  0.000E+00  1.250E-02\n  1.250E-02  2.500E-02\n  2.500E-02  3.750E-02\n  3.750E-02  5.000E-02\n  5.000E-02  6.250E-02\n  6.250E-02  7.500E-02\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  1.250E-02 \nColor by Disp mag.   \n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  3.464E+01\n        9.861E+01\n        6.472E+00\ncut-pl. 3.464E+01\nmag =      8.00  \ncycle     25000\n\n23-Jun-08   1:07\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  5E+01\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n \n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax compress. stress\n -4.461E+00\n\nvector scale\n\n0  2E+01\n\n -7.500E-01  0.000E+00\n -1.500E+00 -7.500E-01\n -2.250E+00 -1.500E+00\n -3.000E+00 -2.250E+00\n -3.750E+00 -3.000E+00\n -4.500E+00 -3.750E+00\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  7.500E-01 \nColor by PS1 mag. \n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  3.464E+01\n        9.861E+01\n        6.472E+00\ncut-pl. 3.464E+01\nmag =      8.00  \ncycle     25000\n\n23-Jun-08   1:07\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  5E+01\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\nFigure 6.58 \u2013 Central cross section.

In 3DEC, each block is internally divided into tetrahedra with uniform \n\nstress; therefore vertical stresses in the foundation blocks below the heel of the dam which, in \n\nthe hydraulic model, simulate conductive joints were obtained by averaging the vertical \n\ntetrahedral stresses. With the exception of blocks below dam blocks 7-8 and 8-9, which are \n\ncrossed by fault 22, all elements are of about the same volume, therefore a simple average is \n\nadequate. If there were very narrow zones, weighted averages would have to be determined, \n\ntaking into account each zone\u2019s volume.  \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax normal in plane=  \n  3.370E-03\n\nvector scale\n\n0  2E-02\n\n  0.000E+00  7.500E-04\n  7.500E-04  1.500E-03\n  1.500E-03  2.250E-03\n  2.250E-03  3.000E-03\n  3.000E-03  3.750E-03\n  3.750E-03  4.500E-03\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  7.500E-04 \nColor by N-Disp mag. \n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  1.115E+01\n        5.984E+01\n        3.611E+00\ncut-pl. 1.173E+01\nmag =     32.00  \ncycle     35000\n\n17-Jun-08   5:39\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  2E+01\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\nFoundation joint \n\nNormal displacement (m) \n\nGrout curtain / foundation \n\ninterface  \n\n\n\n 289 \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax shear in plane =  \n  2.423E-04\n\nvector scale\n\n0  1E-03\n\n  0.000E+00  5.000E-05\n  5.000E-05  1.000E-04\n  1.000E-04  1.500E-04\n  1.500E-04  2.000E-04\n  2.000E-04  2.500E-04\n  2.500E-04  3.000E-04\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  5.000E-05 \nColor by S-Disp mag.\n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  1.115E+01\n        5.655E+01\n        1.235E+01\ncut-pl. 2.290E+01\nmag =    128.00  \ncycle     35000\n\n17-Jun-08   3:54\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  5E+00\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax shear in plane =  \n  2.423E-04\n\nvector scale\n\n0  1E-03\n\n  0.000E+00  5.000E-05\n  5.000E-05  1.000E-04\n  1.000E-04  1.500E-04\n  1.500E-04  2.000E-04\n  2.000E-04  2.500E-04\n  2.500E-04  3.000E-04\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  5.000E-05 \nColor by S-Disp mag.\n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  1.115E+01\n        5.655E+01\n        1.235E+01\ncut-pl. 2.290E+01\nmag =    128.00  \ncycle     35000\n\n17-Jun-08   3:54\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  5E+00\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax shear in plane =  \n  2.390E-03\n\nvector scale\n\n0  1E-02\n\n  0.000E+00  4.000E-04\n  4.000E-04  8.000E-04\n  8.000E-04  1.200E-03\n  1.200E-03  1.600E-03\n  1.600E-03  2.000E-03\n  2.000E-03  2.400E-03\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  4.000E-04 \nColor by S-Disp mag.\n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  1.115E+01\n        5.460E+01\n        1.259E+01\ncut-pl. 2.290E+01\nmag =    128.00  \ncycle     35000\n\n17-Jun-08   5:39\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  5E+00\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\n \n\n    3DEC (Version 3.50)\n\n                                                                                \n\nMax shear in plane =  \n  1.275E-03\n\nvector scale\n\n0  5E-03\n\n  0.000E+00  2.500E-04\n  2.500E-04  5.000E-04\n  5.000E-04  7.500E-04\n  7.500E-04  1.000E-03\n  1.000E-03  1.250E-03\n  1.250E-03  1.500E-03\n    min        max\n\ninterval =  2.500E-04 \nColor by S-Disp mag.\n\ndip=   90.00 below\ndd =   90.00\ncenter  1.115E+01\n        5.279E+01\n        1.417E+01\ncut-pl. 2.279E+01\nmag =    128.00  \ncycle     35000\n\n17-Jun-08   3:53\n\ngeometric scale\n\nCross section plot:\n\n0  5E+00\n\nLNEC - DB                        \n\n \n\nFigure 6.61 - Shear joint displacement vectors for the reservoir at a) 132.2 m, and b) 143.6 m. \n\n \n\nNaturally, as water rises in the reservoir vertical compressive stresses decrease. In the valley \n\nbottom, unlike close to both abutments, tensile stresses are calculated below the heel of the \n\ndam for the highest reservoir levels (Figure 6.62). Here, stresses increase gradually from the \n\nbase of each slope towards the valley axis and Model 1 leads to lower compressive stresses \n\nand higher tensile stresses. Figure 6.62 analysis shows that the decrease in vertical tensile \n\nstresses in the foundation blocks below the heel of the dam is affected much more by the non-\n\nlinear behaviour of the foundation joint than by that of the grout curtain/rock interface. \n\nVariations in average total vertical stresses in the foundation of the central cantilever and of \n\nblock 20-21 with changes in reservoir level are shown in Figure 6.63. For the highest water \n\nlevel, the tensile stress of 0.5 MPa determined with Model 1 below the heel of the central \n\ncantilever is almost three times that determined with Model 3. At the base of the central \n\ncantilever, vertical stresses determined with both models 2 and 3 are almost the same with the \n\nreservoir up to 143.6 m; but for reservoir levels higher than that, tensile stresses determined \n\nwith Model 3 are lower, due to the opening of the foundation joint. At the base of block \n\n20-21, however, differences in vertical stresses determined with the three different models \n\nonly occur for reservoir levels higher than 150.1 m.  \n\nFoundation joint Grout curtain / foundation \n\ninterface  \n\nFoundation joint Grout curtain / foundation \n\ninterface  \n\nShear displacement (m) \n\nShear displacement (m) \n\nb) \n\na) \n\n\n\n   290 \n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\n\nDam block\n\nV\ne\nr\nti\n\nc\na\n\nl \nst\n\nr\ne\nss\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n\n)\n\n(c\no\nm\n\np\nr\ne\nss\n\nio\nn\n\n (\n-)\n\n, \n t\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\no\n\nn\n (\n\n+\n))\n\n20-21   19-20    18-19    17-18   16-17   15-16   14-15    13-14   12-13   11-12    10-11    9-10      8-9       7-8       6-7\n\n \n\nFigure 6.62 - Average total vertical stresses in the foundation blocks below the heel of the \n\ndam which, in the hydraulic model, simulate conductive joints, with the reservoir at 154.0 m. \n\n \n\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160\n\nReservoir level (m)\n\nV\ne\nr\nti\n\nc\na\n\nl \nst\n\nr\ne\nss\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n\n)\n\n(c\no\n\nm\np\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nio\nn\n\n (\n-)\n\n, \nte\n\nn\nsi\n\no\nn\n\n (\n+\n\n))\n\n  interfaces prevented from opening    grout curtain/foundation interface allowed to open  \n  both interfaces allowed to open  Series3\nSeries4 Series5\n\n \n\nFigure 6.63 \u2013 Variations in average total vertical stresses in the foundation blocks below the \n\nheel of the central cantilever and of block 20-21 which, in the hydraulic model, simulate \n\nconductive joints, with changes in reservoir level. \n\nCentral \n\ncantilever \n\nBlock \n\n 20-21 \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n110 120 130 140 150 160\n\nReservoir level (m)\n\nH\no\n\nr\niz\n\no\nn\n\nta\nl \n\nr\na\n\nd\nia\n\nl \nd\n\nis\np\n\nla\nc\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \na\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n \n\nc\nr\ne\nst\n\n o\nf \n\nth\ne\n c\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nl \nc\na\n\nn\nti\n\nle\nv\n\ne\nr\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n)\n\n(t\no\n\nw\na\n\nr\nd\n\ns \nd\n\no\nw\n\nn\nst\n\nr\ne\na\n\nm\n)\n\n  Model 1                                             \n\n  Model 2  \n\n  Model 3   \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n110 120 130 140 150 160\n\nReservoir level (m)\n\nH\no\n\nr\niz\n\no\nn\n\nta\nl \n\nr\na\n\nd\nia\n\nl \nd\n\nis\np\n\nla\nc\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \na\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n \n\nc\nr\ne\nst\n\n o\nf \n\nth\ne\n c\n\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nl \nc\na\n\nn\nti\n\nle\nv\n\ne\nr\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n)\n\n(t\no\n\nw\na\n\nr\nd\n\ns \nd\n\no\nw\n\nn\nst\n\nr\ne\na\n\nm\n)\n\n  Model 1                                             \n\n  Model 2  \n\n  Model 3   \n\n\n\n 291 \n\n6.7.3.5 Comparison of monitored and numerical results \n\nHorizontal displacement at the crest of the central cantilever \n\nStudies of quantitative interpretation based on recorded displacements in the inverted \n\nplumb-lines, led to the conclusion that horizontal displacements at the crest of the central \n\ncantilever due to hydrostatic loading are about 50 mm with the reservoir at around 150.0 m \n\n(LNEC 2009). Numerical horizontal displacements for the same reservoir level, presented in \n\nTable 6.34, are about 90 % of that recorded. \n\nVertical displacement at foundation joint \n\nThe peripheral joint is monitored with joint gauges, located around 5 metres apart along its \n\nlength, positioned in such a way that each block has three gauges, one of which is located \n\napproximately halfway between dam vertical joints, as shown in Figure 6.64 for the case of \n\nthe central cantilever. Figure 6.65 shows vertical displacements in the joint gauges located at \n\nthe base of the central cantilever plotted versus time. Joint apertures were assumed to be zero \n\non 2002.02.05, when the first filling of the reservoir began, therefore, from that date, recorded \n\ndisplacements would be mainly due to variations in hydrostatic load and to variations in \n\nambient and reservoir temperatures (because variations in ambient and reservoir temperatures \n\ncause changes in the structure\u2019s temperature which, in turn, give rise to arch displacements \n\ntowards upstream if the temperature increases, or towards downstream otherwise). However, \n\nduring the first four months of reservoir filling, not only was foundation treatment still in \n\nprogress, but also, following artificial dam cooling, contraction joints were injected. In \n\naddition, construction of gravity blocks close to the left bank had been concluded only about \n\none month before the beginning of reservoir filling, therefore the thermal field in dam \n\nconcrete was significantly asymmetric. This is probably the reason why the first readings \n\nshown in Figure 6.65 are so widely scattered. \n\nFor the highest reservoir levels recorded until the end of June 2008, of about 150 m, \n\ndisplacements of 0.6 up to 0.92 mm were recorded in joint gauge MJ18, the readings of which \n\nalways showed a coherent pattern. As shown in Table 6.35, a numerical maximum foundation \n\njoint aperture of 1.5 mm is determined for the reservoir at an elevation of 150.1 m. At a \n\ndistance of around 4.5 m from the upstream face of the dam, foundation joint aperture is about \n\n0.8 mm (half of the maximum), which is within the range of recorded displacements. \n\n \n\n\n\n   292 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.64 \u2013 Location of joint gauges in the peripheral joint at the base of the central \n\ncantilever. \n\n \n\n \n\n-0.9\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.3\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n2002-02-05 2003-06-20 2004-11-01 2006-03-16 2007-07-29 2008-12-10\n\nDate\n\nJ\no\n\nin\nt \n\nm\no\n\nv\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n(m\n\nm\n)\n\n(a\np\n\ne\nr\ntu\n\nr\ne\n (\n\n+\n),\n\n c\nlo\n\nsu\nr\ne\n (\n\n-)\n)\n\n55\n\n70\n\n85\n\n100\n\n115\n\n130\n\n145\n\n160\n\nR\ne\nse\n\nr\nv\n\no\nir\n\n l\ne\nv\n\ne\nl \n\n(m\n)\n\n  Joint movement MJ16    Joint movement MJ17    Joint movement MJ18    Reservoir level  \n\nNE1 P1 P2 NE2\n\n \n\nFigure 6.65 \u2013 Recorded vertical displacements at three points located in the peripheral joint at \n\nthe base of the central cantilever. \n\nStresses in the foundation rock mass due to increase in reservoir level \n\nFoundation strains in the vertical direction calculated from readings taken in rod \n\nextensometers GEF4 installed below the central cantilever were analysed and a rough \n\ncomparison with average numerical strains was afterwards carried out.

It is observed that the length of rod extensometers (1) and (2), located \n\nin the upstream area, increases as the reservoir rises, whereas the length of extensometer (3), \n\nlocated at the downstream area, decreases (in vertical extensometers located in dam \n\nfoundations, an increase in the relative displacement of the rod\u2019s top and bottom is related to \n\nrock mass decompression, while a decrease is related to rock mass compression). Strains \n\nrecorded in extensometer (1) are higher than those in extensometer (2) therefore the majority \n\nof the heave in that area occurs in the upper 15.0 m of the foundation rock mass. \n\nExtensometers located in the upstream area are more influenced by variations in ambient \n\ntemperature than the one located downstream. With the reservoir level approximately \n\nconstant, an increase in ambient temperature leads to settlement of both extensometers located \n\nat the upstream area, while a decrease leads to their heave, which is explained by arch dams\u2019 \n\nbehaviour. \n\nTable 6.37 shows recorded strains for different reservoir levels. In an attempt to determine \n\nvariations in strains due merely to variations in reservoir level, only readings taken in \n\nFebruary/beginning of March were considered. Even though, there is a difference of around \n\n11\u00b0C (from 7.8\u00b0 up to 18.5\u00b0) in average ambient temperatures recorded in those selected \n\ndates. Variations in vertical strains are shown in Table 6.38, taking readings recorded on \n\n2004.02.03 as reference. \n\nDue to the size of the blocks below the central cantilever, shown in Figure 6.68, only a rough \n\ncomparison of recorded and numerical strains could be carried out. Numerical average \n\nvertical stresses for the different reservoir levels and variations in strains are shown in Table \n\n6.39 and Table 6.40.

Taking into account the cubic law and assuming that water flows through a \n\nsingle discontinuity, variation in a discontinuity\u2019s aperture is equal to the cubic root of \n\ndischarge increase; therefore, due to the above-mentioned increase in reservoir level, \n\ndiscontinuity aperture doubles. \n\nNumerical modelling of tests carried out in drain D25 D led to the conclusion that the \n\nhorizontal layers of higher permeability upstream from the drain simulated horizontal \n\ndiscontinuities with a hydraulic aperture of 0.12 mm. In the global hydraulic foundation \n\nmodel, a similar layer in dam block 17-18 simulated a horizontal discontinuity with a \n\nhydraulic aperture of 0.06 mm. Taking these results into account and assuming that the \n\ndiscontinuity aperture doubles, a rough estimate is that aperture probably increases 0.10 mm, \n\nfrom 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm. In Model 3, differences in average vertical stresses for the various \n\nreservoir levels were used to determine variations in apertures of horizontal water conductive \n\ndiscontinuities below the heel of the dam.

This may be due either to an excessive \n\nestimate of variations in vertical stresses, or to an inadequate rock mass deformability \n\nmodulus.  Concerning the latter, an average rock mass deformability modulus of 10 GPa was \n\nassumed in the green schist area, but the Young\u2019s modulus varies from one foundation area to \n\nanother. Results presented in Table 6.41 for the reservoir at 143.6 m would lead to a variation \n\nof 0.10 mm in the discontinuity aperture if it were assumed that the area below the heel of \n\nblock 17-18 was less deformable than the average, and a Young\u2019s modulus of 29 GPa were \n\nconsidered.   \n\n6.7.4 Hydromechanical interaction \n\n6.7.4.1 Introduction \n\nThe hydromechanical interaction in the foundation of Alqueva dam was studied taking into \n\naccount the results of both the hydraulic and mechanical models developed and carrying out \n\nindependently uncoupled hydraulic and mechanical analyses. Firstly, the numerical hydraulic \n\nmodel was run for different reservoir levels and, for each level, the permeability of the \n\nhorizontal layers which simulate water conductive joints was adjusted so that numerical \n\ndischarges in the foundation of each dam block were close to recorded discharges. Secondly, \n\nthe mechanical model was run assuming the same water levels, and average vertical stresses \n\nin the foundation blocks were obtained (blocks below the heel of the dam which, in the \n\nhydraulic model, simulate conductive joints). Finally, the above-mentioned results of both \n\nmodels allowed the plotting of graphs of stress versus permeability, from which a different \n\ncorrelation for some dam blocks could be established. \n\n6.7.4.2 Correlation between stress and permeability \n\nThe mechanical model described in the previous section allows the calculation of stresses for \n\ndifferent reservoir and tailwater levels and, as previously mentioned, does not take into \n\naccount variations in ambient and reservoir temperature. Therefore, to establish the relation \n\nbetween stress and permeability, ensuring that discharges are mainly due to the effect of the \n\nhydrostatic loading, with small changes due to variations in dam temperature, only discharges \n\nrecorded in February/beginning of March were taken into account in the subsequent analysis. \n\nRecorded discharges with the reservoir at low elevations were neglected, as it had been \n\nconcluded that the hydraulic model could not be employed for the lower reservoir levels. \n\nDischarges monitored on six different dates were considered, with the reservoir level varying \n\naround 18 m, from 132.2 m up to 150.1 m. \n\n\n\n   298 \n\nRecorded discharges in the foundation of the dam blocks located in the valley bottom and at \n\nthe base of each slope on the above-mentioned dates, shown in Figure 6.69, reveal that field \n\ndata is not always consistent, as discharges do not always increase with the reservoir level. \n\nThat is the case, for example, with discharges recorded on 2008.03.04, with the reservoir at \n\n147.6 m, which, in dam blocks between joints 6 to 12, 13 to 15 and in block 17-18 were lower \n\nthan those recorded on 13.02.2006, with the water 2.8 m lower. Around 20 % of the readings \n\nshown in Figure 6.69 were discarded due to inconsistency (21 readings out of 90). Discharges \n\nrecorded in the foundation of the central cantilever (block 13-14) and those recorded with the \n\nthree lower reservoir levels in blocks 10-11 and 20-21 also had to be neglected because \n\nnumerical discharges obtained with the homogeneous model were higher than those recorded \n\n(in the homogeneous model an equivalent permeability of 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s is assumed in the \n\nwhole foundation and the grout curtain is assumed to be 10 times less pervious than the rock \n\nmass).  \n\nAfter running the numerical hydraulic model for the various reservoir levels, the permeability \n\nof the horizontal layers which simulate water conductive joints was adjusted so that numerical \n\ndischarges in the foundation of each dam block were close to recorded discharges (Table \n\n6.42). This adjustment was carried out taking into account that in a homogeneous rock mass \n\ndischarges vary linearly with permeability.  \n\n \n\n Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos caudais observados por blocos\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\n\nDam vertical joint\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n2003.02.03  H=132.17m 2003.03.10  H=136.32m 2004.02.02  H=143.98m 2006.02.13  H=144.84 2008.03.04  H=147.64m 2007.02.28  H=150.1m\n\n21        20         19        18         17         16         15        14        13         12        11         10         9           8           7          6\n\n \n\nFigure 6.69 \u2013 Recorded discharges in the foundation of each dam block with the reservoir at \n\ndifferent elevations. \n\nDistribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos caudais observados por blocos\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\n\nDam vertical joint\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n  2003.02.03    H=132.2 m\n\n  2003.03.10    H=136.3 m\n\n  2004.02.02    H=144.0 m\n\n  2006.02.13    H=144.8 m\n\n  2008.03.04    H=147.6 m\n\n  2007.02.28    H=150.1 m\n\n21        20         19        18         17         16         15        14        13         12        11         10         9           8           7          6\n\n\n\n 299 \n\nResults presented in Table 6.42 reveal that in the foundation of one of the blocks, the \n\npermeability of a horizontal layer for a lower reservoir level can be higher than that for a \n\nhigher level (e.g. block 8-9 and reservoir levels 144.8 m and 147.6 m). This is due to the fact \n\nthat although the same model is used, boundary conditions vary. In some cases, an equivalent \n\npermeability lower than that of the rock mass (1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s) was calculated, which would \n\nmean that the horizontal layer which simulates water conductive joints was less pervious than \n\nthe surrounding media. These results are not logical, and therefore were not taken into \n\naccount. Figure 6.70 shows the variation in the permeability of the horizontal layers which \n\nsimulate water conductive joints with the reservoir level of the blocks in which the number of \n\npoints is equal or greater than 5. Exponential curves were adjusted to the values obtained, \n\nusing regression analysis, and the R-squared values also displayed on the chart, varying from \n\naround 0.82 to 0.98, show that this type of curve fits the available data well. \n\nThe average vertical stresses at the heel of the five above-mentioned blocks obtained with the \n\nmechanical model are shown in Figure 6.71. Analysis of the results began with an attempt to \n\nestablish a correlation between stress and permeability assuming that, in each block, the \n\npermeability of the horizontal layer was a function of the vertical stress only.

The conclusion was drawn that variations in vertical stresses have less influence on \n\npermeability in the more pervious layers in the foundation of blocks 12-13, 16-17 and 17-18, \n\nand a large effect in blocks 8-9 and 19-20. For the highest water levels, compression stresses \n\nare very low, as shown in Figure 6.71, therefore the points obtained for the lower values of \n\n(?yy / ?yy ref) are more scattered.  \n\nThe number of recorded discharges analysed, on six different dates with the reservoir at \n\ndifferent elevations, only made it possible to establish the dependence of permeability on \n\nstress for the foundation of five dam blocks. If a greater amount of data had been analysed, \n\nmore and perhaps better relationships could have been established.  \n\nThe equivalent permeability values shown in Table 6.42 for the reservoir at 144.8 m, assumed \n\nas the reference level, were used to estimate the aperture of a hypothetical single discontinuity \n\nthrough which water flowed in the foundation of each block. These apertures are shown in \n\nTable 6.43 and were determined taking into account Darcy\u00b4s law and the cubic law, according \n\nto which discharge varies with the cube of the aperture: \n\nhikq\nH\n\n?  (6.13) \n\ni\nga\n\nq\n?12\n\n3\n\n?  (6.14) \n\nwhere q = discharge per metre through a layer of height h;  kH = hydraulic conductivity [LT\n-1\n\n]; \n\ni = hydraulic gradient (head loss/length over which head loss occurs); a = fracture hydraulic \n\naperture [L]; v = kinematic viscosity of the fluid [L\n2\n T\n\n-1\n]; and g = acceleration due to gravity \n\n[L T\n-2\n\n]. Assuming that the variation in the aperture of a horizontal discontinuity with the \n\naverage vertical stress is approximately linear, variations in the aperture of a single horizontal \n\ndiscontinuity were compared with the curves established for blocks 8-9 and 19-20 and are \n\nshown in Figure 6.74. It can be seen that for block 19-20 the discharges match quite well \n\nwhen it is assumed that water flows through a single discontinuity, whereas for block 8-9 \n\nthere is a considerable difference indicating that water flows through more than one \n\ndiscontinuity. \n\nDischarges in each dam block were afterwards determined using the established curves shown \n\nin Figure 6.73, and the numerical results were compared with recorded discharges. The charts \n\nin Figure 6.75 and Figure 6.76 show recorded discharges alongside both the results of the \n\nmodel calibrated for water levels on different dates, using the equivalent permeability values \n\nshown in Table 6.42, and those of the model in which the different curves ?-k established \n\nwere used. Results obtained with both the above-mentioned models are accurate, but the latter \n\nhas the advantage  of using a generic law which is valid for the different water levels.

permeability with strain than with stress, \n\nin an equivalent continuum, as the aperture of discontinuities with a very high normal \n\nstiffness barely changes with variations in stresses (Brown and Bray 1982; Chen et al. 2007; \n\nWei and Hudson 1990). \n\nIn the previous section, curves which represent the dependence of permeability on stress were \n\nestablished. These curves follow the pattern: \n\nverticalekk\nhorizontal\n\n???\n?\n\n0  \n(6.15) \n\nTaking into account that stresses in the vertical direction are given by\nverticalvertical\n\nE ?? ? , the \n\nstress can be replaced by the strain, and Equation 6.15 can be written in the following way: \n\nverticalvertical ekekk\nE\n\nhorizontal\n\n???? ??\n??\n\n00  \n(6.16) \n\nIn the previous equation, E?? ? . Assuming that the average value of ?, ? , is given \n\nby E?? ?  and that the rock mass is the same in every foundation block, with an average \n\nYoung\u2019s modulus of 10 GPa (assumed in the mechanical model in the green schist area), the \n\ndifferent curves shown in Figure 6.73 can be due to differences in the horizontal layer\u2019s \n\ndeformability. In dam blocks 8-9 and 19-20, the curves are steeper, therefore the horizontal \n\nlayers of higher permeability are probably in more deformable rock mass areas, with a \n\nYoung\u2019s modulus lower than that assumed. On the contrary, the curves established for dam \n\nblocks 12-13, 15-16 and 16-17, which are less steep, probably correspond to rock mass areas \n\nwith a higher Young\u2019s modulus. The foundation of dam block 8-9 is probably more \n\ndeformable because it is located close to the area where the green schist meets the phyllite. \n\nThe greater deformability of the foundation of block 19-20 may be explained by the fact that \n\nit is crossed by 4 faults, as shown in Figure 4.11, which were not treated (faults 8, 9, 10 and \n\n11).  \n\nThe arithmetic mean of the different ? determined in the curves established for the five \n\ndifferent dam blocks is 1.05, therefore ?  = 10.5.

These results are \n\nconsistent with what is known about the local geology. \n\nThe modulus of deformation of the rock mass is given by: \n\nskEE\nnRRM\n\n111\n??  \n\n(6.17) \n\nwhere ER is the modulus of deformation of the rock matrix, kn is the fracture normal stiffness, \n\nand s is fracture spacing. Therefore, when the normal stiffness is very high, the dominant term \n\nis 1/ER, and when normal stiffness is low, the dominant term is 1/(kn s). It is concluded that, in \n\na discontinuum model high normal stiffness values should be considered in descontinuities \n\nlocated in the area of the more pervious layers in blocks 12-13, 15-16 and 16-17, and low \n\nvalues in blocks 8-9 and 19-20. \n\n6.7.4.4 Discussion \n\nThe study presented in this section was carried out assuming various hypotheses and \n\nsimplifications which are justified in the following paragraphs. \n\n\n\n   308 \n\nNumerical analysis was carried out assuming that both dam concrete and rock mass behave in \n\nan elastic linear manner. This constitutive model can be used for dam concrete as the study is \n\ncarried out for moderate loads, corresponding to normal dam operation, which do not lead to \n\nnon-elastic behaviour. In the rock mass, the behaviour is not linear whenever joints open. The \n\nrock mass was assumed to be isotropic, both from a mechanical and hydraulic point of view. \n\nHowever, schist is anisotropic, but there is no data available to characterize the anisotropy. \n\nNumerical mechanical analysis led to the conclusion that, for the highest reservoir level, the \n\nnormal displacement of the grout curtain/rock mass interface is about 1.5 to 2.5 mm in the \n\nupper 3 m. In hydraulic analysis carried out in previous chapters, using both detailed and \n\nglobal models, permeability of the area of higher permeability upstream from the dam \n\nsimulates a vertical discontinuity with a hydraulic aperture of only 0.18 mm. However, as \n\nparameter studies have led to the conclusion that changing the assumed hydraulic \n\nconductivity of this area has limited effect, as long as it is much greater than that of the rock \n\nmass, no change in the hydraulic model is required. \n\nComparison of recorded and numerical results here presented aims to show that the \n\ngeomechanical model developed is quite realistic, simulating the actual dam/foundation \n\nbehaviour reasonably well. A comprehensive study, however, would have to include \n\ncomparison of results obtained at a larger number of points. \n\nThe horizontal displacement at the crest of the central cantilever due to hydrostatic loading \n\nwas compared against results of quantitative interpretation studies. However, numerical \n\nfoundation joint apertures and strains in the foundation rock mass were compared taking into \n\naccount dam monitoring results, which are dependent not only on variations in reservoir level \n\nbut also on variations in ambient temperature, acting simultaneously. More accurate \n\ncomparisons could have been achieved if quantitative interpretation studies had been carried \n\nout in order to separate and identify each one of the loads\u2019 contributions to the observed \n\neffects. Due to the large size of foundation blocks below the dam arch, only a rough \n\ncomparison of recorded and numerical strains in the foundation could be made. However, \n\nstrains of the same order as those recorded were determined. \n\nIn the mechanical model, hydrostatic loading was only applied to the upstream face of the \n\ndam. In order to obtain total stresses, it should have been applied not only to the upstream \n\nface of the dam but also to the base of the reservoir and on the open area of the grout \n\ncurtain/foundation interface (it should not be applied on the open area of the foundation joint \n\nbecause the foundation joint is sealed). These two simplifications have little effect on vertical \n\nstresses close to the base of the dam, which is what really controls seepage. An alternative \n\nmodel, probably more correct, would be to use effective stresses, and in this case the water \n\npressures would have to be taken into account in the mechanical analysis. In this study, \n\n\n\n 309 \n\nconclusions were drawn from relative values and therefore are not affected by the above-\n\nmentioned simplification. \n\nStudy of the hydromechanical interaction required a careful selection of recorded discharges, \n\nin order to use only coherent data. Incoherent field data is due to the fact that discharges \n\ndepend not only on discontinuities\u2019 aperture but also on seepage paths, which may vary with \n\nchanges in the reservoir level or ambient temperature. When these changes occur, a portion of \n\nthe water that flows into the foundation of one of the dam blocks can change its path and flow \n\ninto the foundation of adjacent blocks, as a result of the opening and closure of \n\ndiscontinuities. \n\nThe dependency of permeability on local geological features, in addition to dependency on \n\nstress level, makes it very difficult or even impossible, to have a single ?-k law. \n\n6.7.4.5 Summary and conclusions \n\nThis section presents a methodology which can be used to establish rules which, from a \n\nhydraulic model calibrated for a specific water level in the reservoir, allow the calculation of \n\ndischarges for both higher and lower reservoir levels, taking into account that permeability \n\ndepends not only on the stress level but also on local geological features. This simple \n\nmethodology, which uses an uncoupled mechanical-hydraulic analysis, has been applied \n\nsuccessfully in the analysis of recorded discharges in the foundation of some blocks of \n\nAlqueva dam.  \n\nEquivalent continuum models were used to carry out both hydraulic and mechanical analysis.  \n\nThe simplified global hydraulic model of the dam foundation takes into account the results of \n\nborehole water-inflow tests and conclusions drawn from detailed 3D models of the area \n\naround the tests. The main seepage paths were simulated by regions of different permeability. \n\nThe mechanical model here presented allows taking into account the non-linear behaviour of \n\nboth dam joints and interfaces (in this case, foundation joint and grout curtain/rock interface). \n\nTwo areas of different deformability were considered, simulating both the green schist and the \n\nphyllite regions. \n\nDue to the influence of local geology, different rules relating stress and permeability were \n\nestablished for different foundation areas. There is not a single law representative of the \n\nwhole foundation. Exponential laws were found to fit the considered data well, and these laws \n\nallow the calculation of discharges for both higher and lower reservoir levels. However, it \n\nmust be borne in mind that this is only valid within the range of the considered water levels. \n\nIn the foundation of one of the dam blocks it could be concluded that flow is mainly \n\ncontrolled by a single discontinuity. More accurate relations could have been obtained if a \n\n\n\n   310 \n\nlarger amount of reliable data was available. The simplicity of the method presented here \n\nmakes it very useful in the safety assessment of concrete dams. \n\nThe main advantage of carrying out uncoupled hydromechanical analysis is that model \n\ncalibration is easier. Coupled analysis is much more complex and it requires different laws to \n\nbe attributed to the foundation of each dam block. The study was carried out with equivalent \n\ncontinuum models, an alternative to which would be to use discontinuum models. This, \n\nhowever, would present significant difficulties due to lack of data. In fact, both the position \n\nand aperture of discontinuities are unknown and, in addition, water flows only through some \n\nof the discontinuities. The 3D nature of the analysis makes it even more difficult. The issue of \n\nhydromechanical analysis using discontinuum models with a view to evaluating dam stability \n\nwill be addressed in the following chapter. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 311 \n\n6.8 Piezometric measurements in concrete dam foundations \n\n6.8.1 Introduction \n\nPiezometers in concrete dam foundations have a twofold aim: the first is to evaluate the \n\ndrainage efficiency in the reduction of uplift pressures, and the second is to measure water \n\npressures close to the dam/rock mass interface or in discontinuities within the foundation \n\nalong which sliding may occur. Drainage efficiency is evaluated by using piezometers \n\ninstalled upstream and downstream from the drainage curtain, to monitor the head difference. \n\nUplift pressures and pressures in discontinuities, which have a destabilizing effect, should be \n\nmeasured using small intake areas (Post 1985). However, the majority of the piezometers \n\ninstalled in the foundations of Portuguese concrete dams are boreholes drilled in the rock \n\nmass, with a pipe at the head, fitted with a pressure gauge, and have a long single chamber. In \n\nfact, there are only six Portuguese concrete dams where multilevel piezometers or \n\npiezometers with a small intake area were installed:  \n\n- In Funcho dam, a 49 m high arch dam (of which the main characteristics are briefly \n\ndescribed in sections 2.5.3 and 4.2.5.3), two multilevel piezometers were installed, one \n\nwith two and the other with three different chambers. The foundation consists of schist \n\nand greywacke. The results of borehole water-inflow tests, which led to a detailed \n\nknowledge of the main seepage paths, were used to decide where to locate the chambers \n\n(LNEC 1998b). \n\n- In Penha Garcia dam, a 25 m high gravity dam located on the River Ponsul, in the \n\nCastelo Branco district, with a foundation of quartzite, piezometers were installed in 8 \n\nboreholes at two levels. However, the work was not properly done and chambers were \n\nnot isolated from each other, the same water head being recorded in both chambers in \n\neach of the boreholes. \n\n- In the stilling basins of both Coimbra and Crestuma dams, several multilevel \n\npiezometers were installed. These are barrages (gate-structure dams) located on the \n\nRiver Mondego, in the city of Coimbra, and on the River Douro, 13 km upstream from \n\nPorto, respectively. In Coimbra dam there are 20 piezometers in two cross sections, \n\nwhich allow measurement of hydraulic heads at different levels, in the upstream-\n\ndownstream direction. The gates and the stilling basins transmit the water load to \n\nflanking piers, which go as deep as 25 to 40 m, to bedrock of marl, crossing nearly 35 m \n\nof alluvium. In Crestuma dam foundation there are 20 boreholes, each of them equipped \n\nwith three porous ceramic tubes 0.15 m long. Piezometric readings are taken in three \n\ncross sections. The piers cross 40 m of alluvium to a bedrock of schist. In both dams, \n\npiezometers are located within the alluvial strata (Pinto and Maranha das Neves 1987). \n\n\n\n   312 \n\n- In Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam stilling basin, as mentioned in chapter 4.3.2, there are four multilevel \n\npiezometers, each with two chambers, whose length varies from 1.5 m to 2.55 m. The \n\nlocation and length of each chamber was defined taking into account the boreholes\u2019 logs \n\nand the results of Lugeon type tests. \n\n- In Alqueva dam, two piezometric chambers were installed in two boreholes in the \n\ndownstream dam wall. Logs and hydraulic test results, as well as the results of the 2D \n\nmodel of a vertical cross section at the bottom of the valley presented in chapter 6.2 \n\nwere used to decide the location and length of each chamber (LNEC 2005b). \n\nAs previously mentioned, in chapter 3.3, piezometers accessible to water over their whole \n\nlength take very rough measurements and give only general data which is of limited use \n\n(Londe 1973b) and are not recommended by the ICOLD (2005), as the water pressure \n\nmeasured at the pressure gauge is the result of the inflow and outflow of water from different \n\nstrata or discontinuities which have different hydraulic heads. A numerical study was carried \n\nout to evaluate the extent to which the water pressures that have been recorded in the \n\nnumerous piezometers located in the foundation of our large concrete dams can be \n\nmisleading.  \n\nThe study was carried out using the dimensions of Alqueva dam as reference, with a three-\n\ndimensional model based on the model referred to in chapter 6.3, and includes only three \n\nboreholes: a piezometer, to which water flows not only through horizontal layers of higher \n\npermeability between the upstream area and the piezometer, but also through the rock mass, \n\nand two adjacent drains.  It was first thought that the study could be carried out with an \n\naxisymmetric model with the axis of symmetry along the axis of the piezometer. However, \n\nthis idea was abandoned, as an axisymmetric model would not take into account the fact that \n\nseepage takes place in the upstream-downstream direction. The study was progressively \n\ndeveloped using very simple models and comparing the hydraulic head at the piezometer with \n\na long single chamber to the hydraulic heads calculated in more than one chamber. Five \n\ndifferent possible situations were analysed, sketched in Figure 6.78: \n\n1. impervious rock mass and a single layer of higher permeability upstream from the \n\npiezometer, linked to the adjacent drains; \n\n2. either impervious or pervious rock mass and two independent layers of higher \n\npermeability upstream from the piezometer, with the upper one linked to the adjacent \n\ndrains; \n\n3. impervious rock mass, two horizontal layers of higher permeability upstream from the \n\npiezometer and a link between the piezometer and the adjacent drains at an elevation \n\ndifferent from those of the horizontal layers; \n\n\n\n 313 \n\n  \n\nSituation 1 Situation 2 \n\n  \n\nSituation 3 Situation 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nSituation 5  \n\n  k  (\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s)   k  (\u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s) \n\nRock mass  0.0, 0.1 to 3.0 Link between the \n\npiezometer and the \n\ndrains:  \n\n  \n\nNear-surface area \n\nupstream from the dam \n\nwhere the reservoir head \n\nis assumed \n\n - - at the same level as the \n\nupper layer \n\n varied \n\nUpper layer of higher \n\npermeability  \n\n varied - at the same level as the \n\nlower layer \n\n varied \n\nLower layer of higher \n\npermeability \n\n varied - midway between the \n\nlower and upper layers \n\n varied \n\nFigure 6.78 \u2013 Seepage models in the five different situations. \n\n\n\n   314 \n\n4. two layers of higher permeability upstream from the piezometer linked by a pervious \n\nrock mass; \n\n5. rock mass with a low permeability, a single layer of higher permeability upstream \n\nfrom the piezometer and a link between the piezometer and the adjacent drains at a \n\nlower elevation. \n\nIn this study, an impervious rock mass simulates a medium with a very low permeability, \n\nwhen compared to that of the pervious layers. The horizontal layers of higher permeability \n\nand the links between the piezometer and the adjacent drains simulate discontinuities through \n\nwhich water flows. To obtain a quantitative understanding of the effect of different relative \n\npermeability values on the readings at the pressure gauge, numerical water pressures along the \n\nborehole and at the borehole head were determined and compared, for different permeability \n\nvalues in each situation. Discharges were also quantified and analysed. \n\n6.8.2 Model description \n\nThe model used in this study is, as previously mentioned, based on the model referred to in \n\nchapter 6.3.1, formed by a series of adjacent vertical strips. However, the existence of the \n\ngrout curtain was neglected, and therefore a simpler block division was used below the \n\nupstream area of the dam base, between the heel of the dam and the drainage curtain. As in \n\nthe numerical analysis of borehole water-inflow tests, presented in chapter 6.4, the model \n\nincludes only three boreholes, the one in the middle being the piezometer. Due to symmetry, \n\nseepage needs only to be analysed in an area of the foundation with a width corresponding to \n\none and a half times the distance between boreholes, thus being only 4.5 m thick. Both the \n\npiezometer and the adjacent drain are modelled by their axis (diameter zero). The piezometer \n\nand the drain, both vertical, are assumed to be 25 m long, and are located 10.5 m downstream \n\nfrom the upstream face of the dam. It is assumed that the piezometer and the drain are aligned \n\nin a direction perpendicular to the valley axis. Although piezometers are usually located \n\ndownstream from the drainage curtain with a length of about two thirds of that of the drains, \n\nthis assumption does not affect the validity of the study. \n\nHorizontal cuts were made upstream from the piezometer and drain, in order to assume the \n\nexistence of horizontal layers of higher permeability, which simulate discontinuities through \n\nwhich water flows. These layers are 3.0 m high and are located 3.0 to 6.0 m and 11.0 to \n\n14.0 m below the upper edge of the model. Vertical cuts in the upstream-downstream \n\ndirection in the above-mentioned horizontal layers were afterwards made, halfway between \n\nboreholes, so as to assume that the main layers of higher permeability are only upstream from \n\nthe piezometer. \n\n\n\n 315 \n\nBlocks located upstream from the heel of the dam, down to a depth of 14 m were deleted, so \n\nthat the same hydraulic head could be assumed at the upstream face of the horizontal layers. \n\nThis simulates the existence of vertical fissures that come from the heel of the dam, where the \n\nreservoir head is applied. The model, with about 230.0 \u00d7 78.0 \u00d7 4.5 m\n3\n is divided into \n\n76 blocks, internally divided into 58085 tetrahedra, with a total of 19773 grid points (Figure \n\n6.79). The mesh is finer close to both the drain and the piezometer and defined by the average \n\nedge length of the tetrahedral zones: 0.60 m in blocks adjacent to the piezometer and drain; \n\n0.90 m in blocks in the vicinity of the above-mentioned blocks; 2.0 m in blocks located \n\naround the area of interest and 3.0 m in the remaining blocks.  \n\nFigure 6.80 shows the position of the horizontal layers of higher permeability through which \n\nwater flows from the upstream area towards the piezometer, as well as the links between these \n\nlayers and the adjacent drain. The cross section of the more pervious layers upstream from the \n\npiezometer in a direction perpendicular to that of the flow is 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 m\n2\n, and that of the \n\nlayers linking the piezometer to the adjacent drains is 0.6 \u00d7 3.0 m\n2\n. Each of the following \n\nareas were considered as a different model region: rock mass, upper layer of higher \n\npermeability, lower layer, the blocks linking the upper layer to the adjacent drain, and the \n\nblocks linking the piezometer to the adjacent drain, considered in situations 3 and 5. In this \n\nway, the permeability of each area could be easily changed. The pervious rock mass \n\nfoundation considered in situations 2, 3 and 5 was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic \n\nwith a permeability that varied from 0.1 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s to 3.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                  piezometer           \n\n \n\n \n\n10.5 m \n\n7\n8\n\n m\n \n\n230 m \n\n50 m 50 m \n\nupstream downstream \n\n14.0 m \n\n \n\nFigure 6.79 \u2013 Lateral face of the simplified 3D model of the foundation of Alqueva dam. \n\nDivision into blocks and internal mesh. \n\n\n\n   316 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.0 m \n\n3.0 m \n\n5.0 m \n\n3.0 m \n\n \n\nFigure 6.80 \u2013 Relative position of the horizontal layers of higher permeability upstream from \n\nthe piezometer. \n\n6.8.3 Hydraulic boundary conditions \n\nNumerical analysis was carried out assuming the reservoir at an elevation of 143.6 m and the \n\nwater downstream from the dam at an elevation of 81.95 m. A zero pressure was assumed at \n\nthe drain head, which corresponds to a hydraulic head of 61.0 m along the drain borehole. The \n\nhydraulic head is forced to be constant along each piezometric chamber\u00b4s length. \n\n6.8.4 Results analysis \n\nIn each of the previously mentioned situations, numerical analysis was done in two phases:  \n\n- phase 1: it was assumed that the piezometer was open, i.e. working as a drain, and the \n\ntotal discharge was obtained; \n\n- phase 2: it was assumed that the borehole towards which water flows from upstream \n\nwas closed and both the hydraulic head at the piezometer and the discharge at the \n\nadjacent drains were analysed. \n\nIn a rock mass of non-uniform permeability, the hydraulic head at the piezometer depends not \n\nonly on the hydraulic boundary conditions but also on the relative permeability values of the \n\ndifferent model areas. Leakage and seepage velocity, however, depend on the absolute values \n\nof the different permeabilities (Londe 1973c). In the model presented here, the areas are: the \n\nrock mass, the upper and lower layers of higher hydraulic conductivity, and the layers linking \n\nthe piezometer to the adjacent drains. \n\n6.8.4.1 Analysis of discharges and hydraulic heads \n\nResults of the five situations are presented and analysed below. In order to show the results \n\nindependent of the assumed hydraulic boundary conditions and permeability values, graphs of \n\npercentage of hydraulic head versus relative permeability values are presented. \n\n\n\n 317 \n\nSituation 1: \n\nThe simple case of seepage towards a single borehole through a horizontal confined pervious \n\nlayer, which is linked to both the adjacent drains, was analysed first. The rock mass was \n\nassumed to be impervious and a hydraulic conductivity of 5.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s was assumed at the \n\npervious layer. The permeability of the link between the piezometer and the adjacent drain \n\nwas varied in such a way that the relative permeability of the link and that of the layer was \n\nzero, 0.04, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0. It was taken into account that, as the cross section of \n\nthe link is smaller than that of the pervious layer upstream from the piezometer, a link \n\npermeability of 25 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s is required for it to be as pervious as the main layer. Taking into \n\naccount the cubic law (Snow 1965), the layer of higher permeability simulates a rock \n\ndiscontinuity with a hydraulic aperture of 0.12 mm. The hydraulic aperture of the link \n\nbetween the piezometer and the adjacent drains depends on the link\u2019s assumed permeability. \n\nFigure 6.81 shows the variation in boreholes\u2019 discharges in both phases of analysis and the \n\nvariation in percentage of hydraulic head at the piezometer, in the second phase of analysis.  \n\nNaturally, in phase 1, central drain discharges decrease and there is an increase in adjacent \n\ndrains\u2019 discharge due to increase in the link\u2019s permeability. With the previously mentioned \n\nboundary conditions, when the link is as pervious as the main layer, the central drain \n\ndischarge is about half of that when there is no link between the central borehole and the \n\nadjacent drains. \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5\n\nk  link / k layer\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nP\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\n\nta\ng\n\ne\n o\n\nf \nh\n\ny\nd\n\nr\na\n\nu\nli\n\nc\n h\n\ne\na\nd\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n  phase 1: central drain discharge   phase 1: adjacent drain discharge\n\n  phase 2: adjacent drain discharge   phase 2: % of hydraulic head at the piezometer\n\n \n\nFigure 6.81 \u2013 Situation 1: variations in boreholes\u2019 discharges and in percentage of hydraulic \n\nhead at the piezometer for different relative permeability values. \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n\nk link / k layer\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nP\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\n\nta\ng\n\ne\n o\n\nf \nh\n\ny\nd\n\nr\na\n\nu\nli\n\nc\n h\n\ne\na\n\nd\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n  phase 1: central drain discharge\n\n  phase 1: adjacent drain discharge\n\n  phase 2: adjacent drain discharge\n\n  phase 2: % of hydraulic head at the piezometer\n\n\n\n   318 \n\nIn the second phase of analysis, with the central borehole (piezometer) closed, the reservoir \n\nhead is obtained at the piezometer when the main layer is not linked to the adjacent drains. \n\nHowever, a link with a very low hydraulic conductivity leads to a sudden loss of water \n\npressure at the piezometer. When the link is as pervious as the main layer, the water pressure \n\nat the piezometer is 14.5 % of the hydraulic head. Increasing the link permeability to \n\npermeabilities higher than that of the main layer does not significantly alter either the water \n\npressure at the piezometer or the discharge at the adjacent drains. \n\nFigure 6.82 shows the hydraulic head contours in a cross-section through the middle of both \n\nthe pervious layer and the link, together with block contours, assuming that the link is 5 times \n\nless pervious than the main layer (Figure 6.82 a) and as pervious as the main layer (Figure \n\n6.82 b). Figure 6.83 shows the variations in hydraulic head along two perpendicular lines that \n\ncross the piezometer in the upstream-downstream direction and along the line of boreholes. \n\nThe variation in hydraulic head in the upstream-downstream direction is linear except close to \n\nthe line of boreholes. Along the line of boreholes, the maximum hydraulic head decreases as \n\nthe link\u2019s permeability increases. \n\nIn the first phase of analysis, when it is assumed that there is no link between the piezometric \n\nborehole and the adjacent drains, a total discharge of 3.54 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n m\n3\n/s (2.12 l/min) would flow \n\nout of a hypothetical continuous trench 3 m long with the same vertical length as the drains \n\n(Darcy\u00b4s law): \n\nsmAikq\nH\n\n/1054.30.30.3\n5.10\n\n0.616.143\n100.5\n\n57 ??\n????\n\n?\n????\n\n \n\n(6.18) \n\nIn a 3D model, this is simulated assuming the same hydraulic head at the line of the boreholes \n\nacross 3 m of the model\u2019s thickness, 1.5 m each side of the central borehole. In the model \n\npresented here, in which the boreholes are simulated by their axis, and the same hydraulic \n\nhead is assumed along the whole borehole\u2019s length, the numerical drain discharge is \n\n3.14 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n m\n3\n/s (1.88 l/min), which is 88.8 % of the above-mentioned result. The study \n\npresented in chapter 5.2.2, in which seepage in a concrete dam foundation is analysed using a \n\ntwo-dimensional horizontal model, led to the conclusion that the total discharge at a drainage \n\ncurtain, with drains of diameter 0.076 m located 3.0 m apart, is 87 % of the total discharge at \n\na hypothetical continuous trench with the same depth as the drains. The small difference \n\nbetween these percentages is due to the size of the zones around the drain. In fact, around both \n\nthe drain and the piezometer the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones is 0.60 m, while, \n\naccording to the results of both the 2D horizontal model and the 3D model of seepage through \n\na horizontal layer presented in chapter 5, it should be around 0.30 m.  Results are coherent, as \n\nlarger zones lead to greater discharges. \n\n\n\n 319 \n\nIn this first situation, as water flows into the piezometer through one or more discontinuities \n\nlocated in a confined area, simulated by the main pervious layer, the hydraulic pressure \n\nmeasured at the pressure gauge placed at the top of a long single chamber piezometer would \n\nbe the same as that measured in a piezometer with a small intake crossed by the pervious area. \n\n \n\na)  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nb)  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.82 \u2013 Situation 1: hydraulic head contours with the link a) 5 times less pervious than \n\nthe main layer and b) as pervious as the main layer.

Figure 6.84 shows the variations in discharges and in percentage \n\nof hydraulic head at the piezometer for different permeability values of this layer. In phase 1, \n\ncentral drain discharge increases linearly and there is no change in adjacent drains\u2019 discharges \n\ndue to increase in the permeability of the lower layer. When this layer is as pervious as the \n\nupper layer, the central drain discharge is about 3 times that when there is no lower layer. In \n\nphase 2, an increase in the lower layer\u2019s permeability leads to a slight increase in adjacent \n\ndrains\u2019 discharge and to a large increase in the percentage of hydraulic head at the piezometer. \n\nIn fact, taking the case when there is no lower layer as reference, adjacent drains\u2019 discharge \n\nincrease around 2.8 times (from 0.98 l/min to 2.71 l/min) when the lower layer is 10 times \n\nmore pervious than the upper layer, and the percentage of hydraulic head at the piezometer \n\nincreases from 14.5 % to 78.6 %. \n\nVariations in hydraulic head in the middle of the upper layer along two perpendicular lines \n\nthat cross the piezometer in the upstream-downstream direction and along the line of \n\nboreholes are shown in Figure 6.85. The same figure shows the variation in hydraulic head in \n\nthe middle of the lower layer, in the upstream-downstream direction. Results of two ratios \n\nbetween the permeability of both layers are presented: lower layer either 5 times less pervious \n\nor 10 times more pervious than the upper layer. The upper layer is linked to both the adjacent \n\ndrains, therefore the loss of hydraulic head in this layer is always greater than that in the lower \n\nlayer, as shown in Figure 6.85 a). The same figure shows that the loss of hydraulic head at the \n\nlower layer is smaller for higher permeabilities of this layer and, therefore, there is an increase \n\nin the hydraulic head at the piezometer with the increase in the lower layer\u2019s permeability. \n\nWhen the permeability of the lower layer is high compared to that of the upper layer, the \n\nhydraulic head at the upper layer suddenly increases close to the piezometer. Figure 6.85 b) \n\nshows the variation in hydraulic head along the line of boreholes, in the middle of both the \n\nupper layer and the link. Figure 6.86 shows the hydraulic head contours in horizontal cuts \n\nthrough the middle of the pervious layers. \n\nIn this second situation, if there were two piezometers in the piezometric borehole, each of \n\nthem with a small intake area, one crossed by the upper layer and the other crossed by the \n\nlower one, the hydraulic head at the piezometer at a lower level would be the same as that of \n\nthe reservoir, while in the upper piezometer the hydraulic head would be 73.0 m, which is \n\n14.3 % of the reservoir head, as mentioned in the results analysis of situation 1. In a \n\npiezometer with a long single chamber, the percentage of hydraulic head varies from 14.3 % \n\nup to a maximum value which depends on the relative permeabilities of the link between the \n\npiezometer and adjacent boreholes, of both the lower and upper layers.

The rock mass was assumed to be \n\nimpervious and the permeability of the upper and lower layers was assumed to be \n\n5.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s and 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, respectively. The permeability of the link was gradually \n\nincreased and both discharges and water pressures were calculated. Figure 6.88 shows the \n\nvariations in discharges in both phases of analysis and the variation in percentage of hydraulic \n\nhead at the piezometer at the second phase of analysis. In the first phase of analysis water \n\nflows from the upstream area towards the central borehole through the pervious layers, \n\ntherefore central drain discharge is constant, not dependent on the link\u2019s permeability, and no \n\nwater flows out of the adjacent drains.  In the second phase of analysis, this situation is \n\nsimilar to situation 1, in which the amount of water flowing towards the adjacent drains \n\ngradually increases, and therefore, the curves obtained are similar to those for phase 2 shown \n\nin Figure 6.81. However, as the link between the piezometer and the adjacent drains is at a \n\nlower level and there is more water flowing towards the piezometer, discharges and water \n\npressures are slightly different.  \n\nThis situation was not further analysed as, with this model in which the link is located at mid-\n\nway between the pervious layers, it would not be possible to compare the hydraulic head with \n\na single chamber to that with two chambers.  \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n\nk link / k layer\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nP\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\n\nta\ng\ne\n o\n\nf \nh\n\ny\nd\n\nr\na\nu\n\nli\nc\n h\n\ne\na\nd\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n  phase 1: central drain discharge\n\n  phase 1: adjacent drain discharge\n\n  phase 2: adjacent drain discharge\n\n  phase 2: % of hydraulic head at the piezometer\n\n\n\n   324 \n\n0.0\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.1\n\n2.4\n\n2.7\n\n3.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5\n\nk  link / k upper layer\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nP\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\n\nta\ng\n\ne\n o\n\nf \nh\n\ny\nd\n\nr\na\n\nu\nli\n\nc\n h\n\ne\na\n\nd\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n  phase 1: central drain discharge   phase 1: adjacent drain discharge\n  phase 2: adjacent drain discharge   phase 2: % of hydraulic head at the piezometer\n\n \n\nFigure 6.88 \u2013 Situation 3: variations in boreholes\u2019 discharges and in percentage of hydraulic \n\nhead at the piezometer for different values of \nlayerupperlink\n\nkk , assuming an impervious rock \n\nmass. \n\nSituation 4:  \n\nIn situation 4, it is assumed that water flows towards the piezometer through two layers of \n\nhigher permeability and that the piezometer is linked to the adjacent drains by a pervious rock \n\nmass. This new situation is similar to the previous one, but has the advantage of allowing the \n\ncomparison between piezometric heads in a piezometer with a long single chamber and in two \n\npiezometers with chambers of different lengths. Variations in discharges in the first phase of \n\nanalysis have already been analysed in similar situations, either by gradually increasing the \n\npermeability of the lower layer (situation 2) or by gradually increasing the permeability of the \n\nlink between the central and the adjacent boreholes (situation 3), therefore only results of the \n\nsecond phase of analysis are presented here.  \n\nIt was first assumed that k rock mass = 0.5 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s and k upper layer = 5.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, and the \n\npermeability of the lower layer was gradually increased. In order to analyse the way in which \n\nwater pressures vary along the piezometric borehole, numerical analysis was carried out \n\nassuming the piezometer with (Figure 6.89): \n\ni) a long single chamber; \n\nii) two long chambers located 3.0 m apart; \n\niii) two long chambers located 5.0 m apart; \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n\nk link / k layer\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\ne\n (\n\nl/\nm\n\nin\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nP\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\n\nta\ng\ne\n o\n\nf \nh\n\ny\nd\n\nr\na\nu\n\nli\nc\n h\n\ne\na\nd\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n  phase 1: central drain discharge\n\n  phase 1: adjacent drain discharge\n\n  phase 2: adjacent drain discharge\n\n  phase 2: % of hydraulic head at the piezometer\n\n\n\n 325 \n\niv)  two chambers with a small intake area, defined by the zones where the piezometer \n\nis crossed by the pervious layers. \n\nFigure 6.90 shows the variations in discharge and in percentage of hydraulic head at a \n\npiezometer with a long single chamber. In this case, discharges in the adjacent drains increase \n\nby around 1.8 times, from 3.1 to 5.66 l/min, when k lower layer/k upper layer increases from 0.1 to \n\n10, and the percentage of hydraulic head increases from 27.2 % to 66.5 %. A comparison \n\nbetween the percentages of hydraulic head at a piezometer with a long single chamber and \n\nthose at chambers of different lengths is shown in Figure 6.91. In this case, the maximum \n\ndifference between percentages of hydraulic head in a long single chamber and in the \n\nchamber crossed by the most pervious layer is 12.7 %. The greatest differences are obtained \n\nwhen two short chambers are considered, because the loss of water through the rock mass is \n\nsmaller. Figure 6.91 a) shows that when the lower layer is as pervious as the upper layer, the \n\npercentage of hydraulic head in the lower chamber is smaller than that in the upper one. This \n\nis due to the difference in the chambers\u2019 length. In fact, as the lower chamber is longer, the \n\nquantity of water flowing out of this chamber is greater, which reduces water pressures. \n\nAlmost the same hydraulic head is obtained in both chambers when they are short. Analysis \n\nof numerical results with two long chambers located either 3.0 or 5.0 m apart aimed to check \n\nwhether there was a link between both chambers, due to zone sizes. It was concluded that \n\nisolated chambers are suitably modelled, as almost the same results are obtained in both cases, \n\nthe difference being lower than 0.3 %. \n\nFigure 6.92 shows the variations in percentage of hydraulic head along the borehole in the \n\nabove-mentioned cases i), ii) and iv), when the lower layer is either 10 times less pervious or \n\n10 times more pervious than the upper layer. In the first case, the percentage of hydraulic \n\nhead measured with a long single chamber is around the mean value between hydraulic heads \n\nrecorded in both chambers.

A rock mass with a low permeability was \n\nconsidered (k rock mass = 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s) and the permeability of the pervious layer was assumed \n\nto be 5 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s.

Figure 6.96 shows the variations in boreholes\u2019 discharges and in percentage of \n\nhydraulic head at a piezometer with a long single chamber. In the first phase of analysis, as in \n\nsituation 3, central drain discharge is constant. An invariable quantity of water also flows into \n\nthe adjacent drains, through the rock mass. In the second phase of analysis, the percentage of \n\nhydraulic head decreases from 52.4 %, if the piezometer is linked to the adjacent drains by the \n\npervious rock mass, to 3.9 %, if the link is 4 times more pervious than the main layer.

In this method, the \n\nhydraulic heads at nodal points are calculated by solving a set of simultaneous equations. An \n\nequation is established for each node, taking into account that the hydraulic head at each of \n\nthe discontinuity networks\u2019 node depends both on the conductance and on the hydraulic head \n\nat the beginning of the particular branch of the discontinuities that converge to that node \n\n(Figure 6.100). Conductance, c, is given by: \n\nL\n\nag\nc\n\n?12\n\n3\n\n?  \n(6.19) \n\nwhere g = acceleration of gravity; a = hydraulic aperture of the discontinuity; ? = kinematic \n\nviscosity of the water, and L = length of the discontinuity in the direction of flow. \n\nJing and Stephansson (2007) present a similar procedure to determine piezometric heads at \n\ndiscontinuity intersections. They mention that the method can also be applied for unconfined \n\nflow field, using an iterative procedure with initial head. In this case, a set of additional \n\ndiscrete intersection points on fracture segments where the pressure is equal to the \n\natmospheric pressure is considered, so that the final geometric location of the water table can \n\nbe obtained.  \n\nThe horizontal section shown in Figure 6.101 schematically represents the simple set of \n\ndiscontinuities simulated in situation 1, in a 12 m \u00d7 9 m rock mass block, with the same \n\nheight as the layers (3 m). On the left hand side, the hydraulic head is the reservoir level (Hu), \n\nand in both drains is 61.0 m. As seepage occurs in a horizontal level, the solution is \n\nindependent of the elevation head. It is assumed that there is no variation in flow throughout \n\nthe thickness of the rock block. The hydraulic head at the piezometer is the only unknown \n\nparameter and can be easily obtained, taking into account that the quantity of water flowing \n\ninto the model is the same as the drains\u2019 discharge (continuity equation) and that the flow rate \n\nin each network branch (1, 2, and 3) is given by Darcy\u00b4s law: \n\n321\nqqq ??

Figure 6.102 shows the \n\ncomparison of the hydraulic head at the piezometer obtained with the 3D model and with the \n\nsimplified model shown in Figure 6.101 (Equation 6.24). This simple model simulates \n\nseepage very accurately, as differences to the numerical result are lower than 7 %. If the link \n\nis as pervious as the main layer a hydraulic head of 71.3 m is calculated at the piezometer, \n\nwhich is 97.7 % of the numerical result. \n\nThe layer of higher permeability upstream from the piezometer is 3.0 m wide (Figure 6.103), \n\ntherefore the simplified model would be closer to that analysed with 3DEC if an equivalent \n\npermeability were used in Equation 6.24 in branches 2 and 3, instead of the links\u2019 \n\npermeability.

In these cases, unlike in the situation \n\npreviously described, the elevation head must be taken into account, because the set of \n\ndiscontinuities is not horizontal. Hudson and Harrison (2000) highlight that the analysis \n\ncannot be simply extended into three dimensions because in 3D two discontinuity planes meet \n\nalong an intersection line, along which the hydraulic head may vary. Jing and Stephansson \n\n(2007) point out that the principle applies also for 3D problems but with much more \n\ncomplexity in handling fracture system geometry and connectivity. \n\nFigure 6.105 shows the set of rock fractures simulated in situations 2, 3 and 5. The mid-level \n\nof the lower horizontal layer of higher permeability was taken as reference. In this figure, on \n\nthe left hand side of each drawing the pressure head is the reservoir level, and the hydraulic \n\nhead is 61.0 m in both drains. Situation 4, in which it is assumed that water flows towards the \n\ndrains only through the rock mass, was not taken into account. The hydraulic head at each \n\nnode as well as the equations established for each situation are also shown in Figure 6.105. \n\nFigure 6.106 shows the comparison of the hydraulic head at the piezometer obtained with the \n\n3D models and with the simplified models shown in Figure 6.105. In situation 2, results are \n\ncompared to those obtained with an impervious rock mass, shown in Figure 6.84. Here, the \n\ndifference between the results of the simplified model and those obtained with the 3D model \n\nare lower than 12 %. In situation 3, results are very accurate, the difference being lower than \n\n0.5 %. In situation 5, results are not so accurate when klink / klayer is lower than 0.4.

In fact, the 3DEC \n\nmodel for situation 5 was run again, this time assuming an impervious rock mass, and the \n\nresults are almost exactly the same as those obtained with the simplified model, as shown in \n\nFigure 6.107. \n\nResults show that, in each situation, the hydraulic head at the piezometer, and hence the \n\ndirection and magnitude of flow in each discontinuity segment, can be easily obtained with \n\nvery simple models. These models can be very useful in parameter studies, as they provide a \n\nvery quick means to identify which of the parameters has the greatest influence on the \n\nhydraulic head at the piezometer. \n\n6.8.5 Conclusions and discussion \n\nThe majority of the piezometers installed in the foundations of our large concrete dams have a \n\nlong single chamber. Therefore, the water pressure measured at the pressure gauge is a \n\nweighted average pressure, which depends on the hydraulic head at the various discontinuities \n\nthat cross the borehole. In this study, five different possible situations of water flow patterns \n\ncreated by discontinuities crossing the piezometer were analysed. It was taken into account \n\nthat in concrete dam foundations the majority of the flow takes place through discontinuities \n\nthat cross each other and that most of the discontinuities come to an end in another \n\ndiscontinuity. \n\nWhen the piezometer is crossed by joints through which water flows in a single confined area, \n\nas in situation 1, the water pressure recorded at the pressure gauge in a piezometer with a long \n\nsingle chamber is the same as that recorded in one with a small intake crossed by the \n\nconductive joints. However, when the piezometer is crossed by conductive joints at different \n\nlevels, as in the other situations analysed, multilevel piezometers with the piezometric \n\nchambers suitably positioned would provide more useful data. It was found that the most \n\nserious situation is when water flows into the piezometer at a shallow depth, and flows out at \n\na greater depth. In this case, relatively low water pressures can be measured in a piezometer \n\nwith a single long chamber, while high water pressures are found within the discontinuities \n\nclose to the dam/foundation interface, which can affect the dam\u2019s stability.  \n\nThe numerical analysis presented here shows that it is difficult to draw generalized \n\nconclusions concerning the advantages and disadvantages of long or short piezometric \n\nchambers, as the most appropriate solution depends on local conditions. It has also been \n\nshown that it is not possible to establish the length of piezometric chambers in advance as \n\neach situation is different. \n\n\n\n   338 \n\nSituation 2   \n\n2\n5\n.0\n\n8\n.0\n\n10.5\n\n4\n.5\n\nReference\nDatum\n\ny\n\nx\n\nA C\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\nB\n\n3.\n0\n\n3.\n0\n\nz\n\n \n\n            A B C D E F \n\nP/?w 143.6 143.6-8 PC/?w PD/?w 61.0-8 61.0-8 \n\nz 0 8 0 8 8 8 \n\nH 143.6 143.6 H piezom.

It \n\nis not only relevant to know where the piezometric boreholes are crossed by conductive \n\ndiscontinuities, but also if and how these discontinuities are linked to adjacent drains. Seepage \n\npaths, however, can vary with changes in reservoir level or in ambient temperature. It is \n\ntherefore essential that the geology of the area is well understood, and that borehole logs and \n\nresults of Lugeon type tests or borehole water-inflow tests are carefully analysed. At the dam \n\nsite, multilevel piezometers require careful installation, in order to properly isolate the \n\nchambers. \n\nAlthough more detailed data can be obtained with multilevel piezometers, the information \n\nthey provide is very localized, and can be of little value, unless it can be analysed and \n\nunderstood by means of a suitable numerical model. In fact, results of equivalent continuum \n\nmodels presented thus far show that the hydraulic head varies depending not only on the \n\ndepth but also on the location in relation to the reservoir and to the grout and drainage curtains \n\n(e.g. upstream or downstream from the grout or drainage curtains, in the line of the drains, or \n\nin a cross section in the upstream-downstream direction which crosses the drain or which is \n\nmidway between drains). In practice, the complexity of the rock mass jointing pattern and the \n\nfact that water flows only through some of the discontinuities makes it necessary to take into \n\naccount that piezometric heads can vary significantly from one point to another, even if the \n\ntwo points are very close to each other, and therefore, readings may appear incoherent.  \n\nIt must be stressed that in the monitoring of concrete dams it is common practice to be \n\nconcerned with water pressures recorded in piezometers located downstream from the \n\ndrainage curtain when the percentages of hydraulic head are greater than around 30 %. \n\nHowever, readings taken in piezometers with a long single chamber can be misleading. In \n\naddition, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, high percentages of hydraulic head may be \n\nlocalised and therefore not significant regarding the safety of the dam, or may be of concern, \n\nwhen acting on a horizontal discontinuity with a large surface, which encompasses the whole \n\nbase of a dam block. Therefore, when a high percentage of hydraulic head is recorded at a \n\npiezometer, it is important to know whether there exists a horizontal or sub-horizontal \n\ndiscontinuity upon which that pressure is acting (unfavourable to the stability of the dam).  \n\nIn the majority of our large concrete dams, there is one piezometer per dam block and drains \n\nare located 2.5 to 5.0 m apart. In order to understand whether high pressures are localised or \n\nover a wider area, the drainage system should be used, and some simple tests carried out, \n\nfirstly closing the drains close to the piezometer, and then closing the drains located further \n\naway: \n\n\n\n 341 \n\n1. if it is localised, when the drains closer to the piezometer are closed, the water \n\npressure at the piezometric borehole increases and there is no change in the quantity of \n\nwater that flows through drains located further away from the piezometer. The closure \n\nof these latter drains causes no change in the piezometric reading. \n\n2. On the contrary, if there is a horizontal or sub-horizontal discontinuity with a large \n\nsurface where the water pressure is acting, the pressure in the piezometric borehole \n\nincreases when the drains closer to the borehole are closed, as do discharges in \n\nboreholes located in the vicinity, and increases still further when the drains located \n\nfurther away from the piezometer are closed. \n\nAs was seen in chapter 4, valuable additional data can be obtained with borehole water-inflow \n\ntests and water electrical conductivity analyses.  \n\nHigh percentages of hydraulic head might be recorded if vertical and/or sub-vertical \n\ndiscontinuities parallel to the river axis and with high heads cross the piezometric borehole. \n\nThese water pressures, however, are of no concern to the stability of the dam.  In Alqueva \n\ndam, as mentioned in chapter 4.5.8.3, the gradual closure of all the drains and piezometers \n\nlocated in block 17-18 showed that the high percentage of hydraulic head recorded at drain \n\nD25 D while carrying out borehole water-inflow tests was localised.  \n\nFinally, regarding the method suggested by Hudson and Harrison (2000) to study seepage in \n\ncomplex discontinuity networks, which was used in the simple flow cases presented here, it \n\nmust be mentioned that quite accurate results were obtained. However, the method is very \n\ndifficult to apply in practice, because there is a lack of information about the interconnection \n\nbetween conductive joints. \n\n6.9 Summary and conclusions \n\nThe first model presented in this chapter, which was a simplified 2D model of a vertical cross \n\nsection of the dam foundation, follows the standard practice of assuming that water flows \n\nfrom the bottom of the reservoir, goes down around the grout curtain, so that the majority of \n\nthe drained water reaches the drainage boreholes at their lower part. However, seepage in the \n\nfoundation usually differs from the assumed conceptual model as local defects, such as gaps \n\nin the grout curtain, change the flow path. Seepage as that assumed in the conceptual model \n\nwould only be achieved if the watertight curtain were effective. According to Londe (1973), \n\nan effective grout curtain must be thick enough, with permeability much lower than that of the \n\nsurrounding rock mass. In a rock mass of low permeability, such as in Alqueva dam \n\nfoundation, reducing the permeability from around 10\n-7\n\n m/s down to 5 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s would be an \n\nimpressive achievement. Therefore, in these cases, it is very difficult to have an effective \n\n\n\n   342 \n\ngrout curtain because grout only slightly reduces the natural permeability and, as penetration \n\nis limited, the curtain is thin.  \n\nThe tests and field measurements which were required for the assessment of the main seepage \n\npaths in an area of the foundation of Alqueva dam were presented in chapter 4. The \n\nsimulations of borehole water-inflow tests carried out provided a good match of recorded \n\ndischarges and water pressures for different experimental conditions. These simulations are \n\nrelevant as the numerical modelling of tests provides a valuable tool for the validation of \n\nnumerical techniques. The models developed are very simple, and only a few parameters were \n\nused, all of them with physical meaning. The study shows the relevance of knowing where the \n\nmain flow paths are located. Parametric studies carried out showed the importance of \n\nassigning proper values to both rock mass equivalent permeability and the permeability of the \n\nlayers which simulate the main flow paths. \n\nThe knowledge of seepage patterns around some boreholes provided by test analysis was \n\nessential to develop an effective application of a simplified global model of the dam \n\nfoundation. Global hydraulic models of dam foundations are useful not only for the \n\nassessment of the behaviour of dams in use, comparing the average value of discharges and \n\nuplift pressures with numerical results, but also to determine water pressure distributions to \n\ntake into account in stability analysis.  \n\nGlobal 3D models of dam foundations, which involve large volumes of rock masses, can only \n\nbe carried out with coarse meshes. In these models, due to zone sizes, the drainage system is \n\nrepresented in a simplified way. As previously mentioned, the model was developed taking \n\ninto account the results of borehole water-inflow tests and conclusions drawn from the \n\ndetailed 3D models presented in the previous section. It was concluded that parameters \n\ndetermined using the detailed models cannot be used directly in a global 3D model of the \n\nfoundation. In the global model zones are larger, and therefore discharges are greater. \n\nComparison of both numerical and recorded discharges and water pressures showed that the \n\nmodel can provide mean water pressures and flow rates for each dam foundation block. \n\nModels of flow in discontinuous rock masses, while representing more closely the physical \n\nphenomenon, are difficult to apply in many practical cases because of insufficient data on the \n\nhydraulic properties of the various discontinuity sets. Grouting and drainage add to the \n\ncomplexity of flow patterns. However, the analysis presented here shows that the simpler \n\nequivalent continuum models can be used successfully to model the hydraulic behaviour of \n\nboth large and local areas of dam foundations. In equivalent continuum models bands of \n\nelements of higher permeability may be assigned to simulate the main seepage paths. These \n\nlayers, located close to the dam/foundation interface, simulated in both the detailed and global \n\nmodels of the dam foundation may be justified either by the two sub-horizontal sets of rock \n\n\n\n 343 \n\njoints, shown in Figure 4.10, or by the existence of a more disturbed rock mass zone close to \n\nthe surface, due to excavation works. \n\nAs this study shows, borehole water-inflow tests can be extremely significant in increasing \n\nknowledge of the hydraulic behaviour of concrete dam foundations. Not only do these tests \n\nprovide additional information to the usual monitoring data, they also make it possible to \n\nbuild up a picture of the flow paths and thus, to develop realistic and accurate numerical \n\nmodels, which enables more effective assessment of the safety of concrete dams. \n\nThe interdependency between the state of stress and seepage in the foundation of Alqueva \n\ndam was studied in an uncoupled way, taking into account the results of the hydraulic model \n\nand those from a global mechanical model. The latter takes into account the two areas of \n\ndifferent deformability and allows the non-linear behaviour of dam contraction joints and of \n\nboth dam/foundation interface and grout curtain/foundation interface to be taken into account. \n\nThe model was validated by comparing the numerical results with monitoring data. A \n\nmethodology was developed which can be used to establish rules which, from a hydraulic \n\nmodel calibrated for specific water levels in the reservoir and downstream from the dam, \n\nallow the calculation of discharges for both higher and lower reservoir levels, taking into \n\naccount that permeability depends not only on the stress level but also on local geological \n\nfeatures. \n\nThe study on piezometric measurements presented in the last part of this chapter confirmed \n\nthat multilevel piezometers provide more accurate data than piezometers with a long single \n\nchamber. However, the most appropriate solution depends highly on local conditions and \n\ntherefore the positioning and length of the piezometric chambers must be defined case by \n\ncase. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   344 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 345 \n\n7 Analysis of seepage and stability assessment \u2013 the case study of \nPedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\nIn concrete dam foundations, failure mechanisms are typically defined by natural rock \n\ndiscontinuities, the dam/foundation interface or strata with lower strength. Stability analysis \n\nfor scenarios of foundation failure is often based on simplified limiting equilibrium \n\nprocedures. Equivalent continuum models, used in the analysis of seepage presented in the \n\nprevious two chapters, can be employed to assess the safety of concrete dams, complemented \n\nwith interface elements to simulate the behaviour of joints, shear zones and faults along which \n\nsliding may occur. More advanced analysis, however, is carried out with discrete element \n\ntechniques, which allow the discontinuous nature of rock to be properly simulated, and which \n\nmay include fluid flow through the discontinuities. According to Lemos (1999a) they are \n\nparticularly suitable for stability evaluation of dam foundations, given the importance of \n\nsliding and/or separation phenomena on natural joints in failure mechanisms. \n\nThis chapter presents a study on seepage in a gravity dam foundation carried out with a view \n\nto evaluating dam stability. Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam was used as reference and the hydraulic behaviour \n\nin some foundation areas was analysed using both two-dimensional continuum and \n\ndiscontinuum models. Firstly, an equivalent continuum model was developed to study \n\nseepage in a specific cross section of the dam, where the main seepage paths, identified with \n\nthe borehole water-inflow tests presented in chapter 4.4, were represented. A discontinuous \n\nmodel of the dam foundation was afterwards developed, using the code UDEC, and a fully \n\ncoupled mechanical-hydraulic analysis of the water flow through the rock mass \n\ndiscontinuities was carried out. Due to limited data on orientation and spacing between \n\ndiscontinuities within the area being studied, a much idealised fracture pattern was assumed.  \n\nThe discontinuum model was used to assess water pressures in the dam/foundation interface \n\nand along a rock mass horizontal joint of higher hydraulic conductivity, which simulates the \n\nmain flow path. Results of the coupled hydromechanical analysis were compared with those \n\nobtained with a simple hydraulic analysis, in which the joint hydraulic aperture remains \n\nconstant, and also with those obtained assuming that the drainage system is clogged. Results \n\nwere afterwards compared with those obtained assuming rock masses with different \n\nequivalent deformability. Variations in discharges due to the filling and subsequent emptying \n\nof the reservoir were analysed and the influence of joint dilatancy on numerical discharges \n\nwas also investigated. Numerical water pressures were compared with those recorded in situ, \n\nat the piezometers located underneath the stilling basin. \n\n\n\n   346 \n\nDiscontinuum models which simulate the hydromechanical interaction provide a means of \n\nassessing the stability of the dam, taking into account the actual shear displacements and \n\naperture of discontinuities, and the water pressure pattern within the foundation. The safety \n\nfor different failure scenarios involving the foundation and the dam body was evaluated using \n\nthe discontinuum model developed for this study. The method of strength reduction was used \n\nto estimate the stability of the dam/foundation system. Analysis was carried out assuming \n\ndifferent water pressures at the drainage line, including the scenario of a foundation with no \n\ndrainage system. \n\n7.2 Two-dimensional model of vertical cross sections based on the \nhypothesis of an equivalent continuum media \n\n7.2.1 Model description \n\nA two-dimensional model of the foundation of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam was developed to analyse the \n\nflow in the rock mass and to support the assessment of the field results (Farinha et al. 2007). \n\nThe hydraulic properties of an equivalent continuum are considered and the mesh is based on \n\nthat developed in order to study seepage in Alqueva dam foundation, presented in section 6.2, \n\nwhich has the boundaries quite far away from the dam\u2019s area of influence. The mesh was \n\nmodified in the dam area, in order to be adjusted to the length of the dam/foundation interface \n\nalong the upstream-downstream direction, and to the position of both the grout curtain and the \n\ndrainage system. In addition, to take into account the conclusion presented in chapter 6.2.3 \n\nconcerning the distance at which boundaries should be placed from the area being studied \n\nwhen most of the water flows between the reservoir and the drainage system, zones located \n\nfurther away from the dam were assigned zero permeability. In this way, seepage takes place \n\nin a restricted area of about 200 \u00d7 100 m\n2\n. It is assumed that water flows according to Darcy\u2019s \n\nlaw, in a homogeneous and isotropic media. The steady state seepage flow is analysed with \n\nFLAC 5.0. \n\nThe mesh is made up of 1139 zones, and was developed in such a way that it enables the \n\nanalysis of seepage in different cross sections of the dam, namely in blocks 7-8 and 8-9, of \n\nwhich the base is at a level lower than that of the adjacent blocks. The grout curtain is \n\nsimulated by a band of elements 1 m wide. The drains and piezometers are modelled at the \n\nsame position and with the same length as the holes drilled in the foundation. \n\nA detailed study of the hydraulic behaviour of the foundation of block 6B-7, where the \n\nhighest discharges and percentages of hydraulic head are recorded, was carried out. Taking \n\ninto account the results of water pressure permeability tests performed before the construction \n\nof the dam in the area under study it is assumed that the equivalent permeability of the rock \n\nmass is 5.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. The hydraulic conductivity of the grout curtain is assumed to be \n\n\n\n 347 \n\n5.0 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n m/s. The dam body is assumed to be impervious. Figure 7.1 a) shows a detail of the \n\nmesh below the dam. The study was carried out comparing the numerical results to the \n\nmonitoring data collected on 4 April 2006. On this date, the recorded discharge at the drains \n\nof block 6B-7 was 2.78 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n (m\n3\n/s)/m (1.67 (l/min)/m).  \n\n7.2.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions and numerical results \n\nThe lateral and bottom model boundaries are impermeable. The reservoir level is 84.71 m and \n\nthe tailwater level is 60.0 m. Hydrostatic hydraulic heads are applied along permeable \n\nboundaries: a constant pressure is assigned at the bottom of the reservoir corresponding to a \n\nwater height of 33.71 m and downstream from the dam a constant pressure is assigned \n\ncorresponding to a water height of 0.5 m. Taking into account the high number of piezodrains \n\ninstalled in the foundation of block 6B-7, it is not adequate to assume zero water pressure at \n\nthe drains head and therefore the average value of the hydraulic heads recorded at the line of \n\nthe drains (in drains and piezodrains) is assumed at the drainage curtain (65.24 m).  \n\nTaking into account the hydraulic boundary conditions described in the previous paragraph, \n\nthe numerical value of the discharge at the dam drains is about 40 % of the recorded \n\ndischarge. To match the observed values an average hydraulic conductivity of 22.5 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s \n\nwould be needed (4.8 times higher than the assumed equivalent hydraulic conductivity).  \n\nA more accurate model of the foundation of block 6B-7 was developed taking into account \n\nthe existence of tensile stresses at the heel of the dam, due to the filling of the reservoir, which \n\nlead to the opening of vertical fissures. To simulate these vertical fissures, a band of elements \n\nof higher permeability was assumed upstream from the grout curtain (Figure 7.1 b). The depth \n\nof the band of elements is about 20.0 m and the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be \n\n10.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. With this model the average discharge at the dam drains is 45 % of the \n\nrecorded discharge. \n\nFinally, the results of the borehole-water inflow tests performed were taken into account, \n\nsimulating the area where the main seepage paths cross the drains. A horizontal layer of \n\nhigher permeability about 4.5 to 7.5 m down from the drain head was considered, as shown in \n\nFigure 7.1 c). The hydraulic conductivity of this horizontal layer is assumed to be \n\n60.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, and therefore the layer, with a height of 3.0 m, simulates a discontinuity with \n\na hydraulic aperture of 0.28 mm. The layer crosses the grout curtain simulating a hypothetical \n\narea of the foundation where the total sealing of discontinuities with very small apertures was \n\nnot achieved. With this model the average discharge at the drain heads, which is \n\n2.86 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n (m\n3\n/s)/m, is almost the same as the recorded discharge. The difference in hydraulic \n\nhead at two points located around 7.0 m apart along the horizontal layer of higher \n\npermeability was used to calculate the quantity of water flowing through that layer. It was \n\n\n\n   348 \n\nconcluded that, with this model, around 40 % of the drain discharge is water that flows \n\nthrough the layer.  \n\nThe numerical discharges with the three models presented in Figure 7.1 and their difference, \n\nin percentage, to the recorded discharge are shown in Table 7.1. Figure 7.2 shows the \n\nhydraulic head contours and seepage velocity for the three different models. In the final \n\nmodel, the maximum seepage velocity is about 6.5 times higher than in model b) and around \n\n8.0 times higher than in model a), and therefore, to make the flow patterns visible, the flow \n\nvectors are not represented at the same scale. Figure 7.2 shows that there are only changes in \n\nthe hydraulic head contours close to heel of the dam, with the exception of model c), in \n\nwhich, due to the horizontal layer of higher permeability, the area with a hydraulic head \n\nbetween 64.5 m and 66.0 m extends a little further towards downstream. The seepage pattern, \n\nhowever, changes significantly in model c), in which the highest seepage velocity and the \n\nmajority of the flow are concentrated in the layer of higher permeability that crosses the grout \n\ncurtain.  \n\nThe model shown in Figure 7.1 c) was used to calculate discharges with the reservoir at level \n\n80.67 m. This level was recorded on 1 March 2006, and the average discharge in block 6B-7 \n\nwas 2.43 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n (m\n3\n/s)/m. It was taken into account that the average value of the hydraulic \n\nhead recorded on that date was 64.12 m. The numerical discharge is only 1 % higher than that \n\nrecorded. \n\nThe model shown in Figure 7.1 a) was afterwards used to study the hydraulic behaviour of the \n\nfoundation of blocks 5-6, 6-6A and 6A-6B. No tests were performed in the foundation of \n\nthese blocks, and therefore it was decided that it would be more adequate to use the simplest \n\nmodel developed. Taking into account the results of water permeability tests it is assumed that \n\nthe hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass in this area of the foundation is 1.8 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s. \n\nThe average value of the hydraulic heads recorded at the line of the drains is 59.15 m. The \n\nnumerical value of the discharge at the dam drains is 64 % of the recorded discharge. To \n\nobtain the recorded discharge, an equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 3.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s would be \n\nnecessary (1.7 times higher than the assumed equivalent hydraulic conductivity). \n\nThe study presented here shows that the knowledge of the area where the main seepage paths \n\ncross the tested boreholes, referred to in chapter 4.4, allowed a more in-depth analysis of the \n\nfoundation area where both the highest discharges and water pressures are recorded, and the \n\nimprovement of the developed numerical model. \n\n \n\n\n\n 349 \n\n  FLAC (Version 4.00)        \n\nLEGEND\n\n    4-Jan-09  21:08\n\n  step    600000\n\nCons.

Joint apertures and water pressures are updated at every \n\ntimestep. The algorithm is described by Lemos (1987). It is assumed that rock blocks are \n\nimpervious and that flow takes place only through the set of interconnecting discontinuities. \n\nThese are divided into a set of domains, separated by contact points. Each domain is assumed \n\nto be filled with fluid at uniform pressure and flow is governed by the pressure differential \n\nbetween adjacent domains. \n\nFlow is modelled by means of the parallel plate model, and the flow rate per unit width is thus \n\nexpressed by the cubic law. The flow rate through contacts is given by: \n\nl\n\np\nakq\n\nj\n\n?\n??\n\n3\n \n\n(7.1) \n\nwhere kj = a joint permeability factor (also called joint permeability constant), whose \n\ntheoretical value is 1/(12 ?) being ? the dynamic viscosity of the fluid; a  = contact hydraulic \n\naperture; l = length assigned to the contact between the domains. The dynamic viscosity of \n\nwater at 20\u00b0C is 1.002 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n N\n.\ns/m\n\n2\n and therefore the joint permeability factor is 83.3 Pa\n\n-1\ns\n\n-1\n. \n\nIn UDEC, the hydraulic aperture to be used in Equation 7.1 is given by: \n\naaa ???\n0\n\n (7.2) \n\nwhere a0 =  aperture at nominal zero normal stress and a?  = joint normal displacement taken \n\nas positive in opening. A minimum value, ares, is assumed for the aperture, below which \n\nmechanical closure does not affect the contact permeability. A maximum aperture, amax, is \n\nalso assumed. Figure 7.3 shows the variation of joint aperture with normal stress, used by \n\ndefault in the code UDEC. \n\nTotal stresses are obtained inside the impervious blocks and effective normal stresses at the \n\nmechanical contacts. The timestep is limited to a value which is proportional to the domain \n\nvolume and inversely proportional to the bulk modulus of the fluid and to joint conductivity \n\n(Equation 3.3), as explained in section 3.6. In problems in which only the final steady-state \n\ncondition is of interest, the code UDEC is very efficient, as several simplifications are \n\npossible, which accelerate the convergence to the solution. \n\n\n\n   352 \n\n \n\nFigure 7.3 \u2013 Relation between hydraulic aperture, a, and joint normal stress, ?n, in UDEC \n\n(after Itasca 2004). \n\n7.3.2 Model description \n\nThe discontinuous model of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam foundation developed to analyse fluid flow \n\nthrough the rock mass discontinuities is shown in Figure 7.4. A much idealised fracture \n\npattern was assumed. Two sets of discontinuities were simulated: the first joint set is \n\nhorizontal and continuous, with a spacing of 5.0 m, and the second set is formed by vertical \n\ncross-joints, with a spacing of 5.0 m normal to joint tracks and standard deviation from the \n\nmean of 2.0 m. The former attempts to simulate the sub-horizontal set of discontinuities g) \n\nand the latter the sub-vertical set b), both of which were referred to in chapter 4 and whose \n\naverage position in relation to the dam is shown in Figure 4.19. An additional rock mass joint \n\nwas assumed downstream from the dam dipping 25\u00b0 towards upstream, necessary to the \n\nstability analysis presented in section 7.4.3. The foundation model is 200.0 m wide and \n\n80.0 m deep. The dam has the crest of the uncontrolled spillway 33.8 m above ground level \n\nand the base is 44.4 m long in the upstream-downstream direction (Chapter 4.3). In concrete, \n\na set of horizontal continuous discontinuities located 2.0 m apart was assumed to simulate \n\ndam construction joints. The numerical model has 611 deformable blocks divided into 2766 \n\nzones, and 3451 nodal points.  \n\nBoth dam concrete and rock mass blocks are assumed to follow elastic linear behaviour, with \n\nthe properties shown in Table 7.2. Discontinuities are assigned a Mohr-Coulomb constitutive \n\nmodel, complemented with a tensile strength criterion. In a base run, the mechanical \n\nproperties shown in Table 7.3 were assumed. A construction joint normal stiffness (kn) of 10 \n\nGPa/m corresponds to the assumption that these joints have a width of 3 m of material \n\nidentical to dam concrete. In the rock mass, the assumed kn is an average of laboratory test \n\nresults. A ratio of 0.5 is assumed between normal and shear stiffnesses. Both at the dam \n\nconstruction joints and at the concrete/rock mass interface cohesion and tensile strength were \n\nassigned 2.0 MPa. In rock joints, cohesion and tensile strength are assumed to be zero. \n\n\n\n 353 \n\n200 m\n\n80 m                                \n\n33.8 m                                \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   21-Nov-08  10:03\n\n  cycle         0 \n\n  time  =  0.000E+00 sec\n\nblock plot                 \n\n-1.000\n\n-0.800\n\n-0.600\n\n-0.400\n\n-0.200\n\n 0.000\n\n 0.200\n\n 0.400\n\n 0.600\n\n(*10^2)\n\n-0.500 -0.300 -0.100  0.100  0.300  0.500  0.700  0.900  1.100\n\n(*10^2)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (blocks)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                              \n\n \n\nFigure 7.4 \u2013 UDEC model of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam foundation.   \n\n \n\nMaterial Density Young\u00b4s modulus (E) Poisson\u2019s ratio \n\n (kg/m\n3\n) (GPa) - \n\nDam 2400 30 0.2 \n\nRock blocks 2650 10 0.2 \n\nTable 7.2 \u2013 Material properties. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuities Normal \n\nstiffness \n\nkn \n\nShear \n\nstiffness \n\nks \n\nFriction \n\nangle \n\n? \n\nCohesion \n\n \n\nc \n\nTensile \n\nstrength \n\n?t \n\n (GPa/m) (GPa/m) (\u00ba) (MPa) (MPa) \n\nDam construction joints 10 5 35\u00ba 2 2 \n\nRock joints 10 5 35\u00ba 0 0 \n\nDam/foundation joint 10 5 35\u00ba 2 2 \n\nTable 7.3 \u2013 Mechanical properties of discontinuities. \n\n7.3.3 Sequence of analysis \n\nAnalysis was carried out in two loading stages. Firstly, the mechanical effect of gravity loads \n\nwith the reservoir empty was assessed. An in-situ state of stress with an effective stress ratio \n\n?H/?V = 0.5 was assumed in the rock mass. The water table was assumed to be at the same \n\nlevel as the rock mass surface upstream from the dam. Secondly, the hydrostatic loading \n\ncorresponding to the full reservoir was applied to both the upstream face of the dam and \n\n\n\n   354 \n\nreservoir bottom. Mechanical pressure was first applied, followed by fluid flow analysis. In \n\nboth stages, vertical displacements at the base of the model and horizontal displacements \n\nperpendicular to the lateral model boundaries were prevented. Regarding hydraulic boundary \n\nconditions, joint contacts along the bottom and sides of the model were assumed to have zero \n\npermeability. On the rock mass surface, the head was 33.8 m upstream from the dam, and \n\n5.0 m downstream. \n\nIn order to adjust joint flow properties, the model was first run without grout curtain and with \n\nno drainage system and the results were compared with those obtained with a FLAC model \n\nsimilar to that shown in Figure 7.1 a), but with no grout curtain or drains. The UDEC model \n\nwas slightly changed for this comparison, adopting a regular joint pattern in the whole \n\nfoundation with the rock mass horizontal joint closest to the dam/foundation interface located \n\n2.5 m away from the interface, instead of 5.0 m. Regular joint patterns do not simulate water \n\nflow in dam foundations properly because, in reality, discontinuities are not regular. However, \n\nin this way the UDEC model is more similar to a continuum model. The equivalent \n\npermeability of the rock mass is assumed to be 5.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, as in the FLAC model. The \n\ncorrelation between this and the joint coefficient of permeability, kf , is given by: \n\nd\n\nk\nk\n\nf\n\nmassrock\n?\n\n \n\n(7.3) \n\nwhere d is the spacing of discontinuities and:  \n\n?12\n\n2\nag\n\nk\nf\n?\n\n \n\n(7.4) \n\nThe joint coefficient of permeability is thus 25.0 \u00d7 10\n-7\n\n m/s, and the hydraulic aperture of \n\ndiscontinuities is 0.1457 mm. Assuming this as a constant aperture in all the discontinuities \n\n(UDEC disregards the interaction between hydraulic and mechanical effects and performs a \n\nsimple hydraulic analysis if the joint aperture is assigned to ares and (-1) is assigned to a0), the \n\nquantity of water that flows through the UDEC model (0.77 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n (m\n3\n/s)/m) is almost the \n\nsame as that in the FLAC model (0.78 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n (m\n3\n/s)/m). This result may seem incoherent \n\nbecause the FLAC mesh is finer and therefore drain discharges should be lower. However, in \n\nthe UDEC mesh, seepage occurs through the domains (in UDEC, a \u201cdomain\u201d is a segment of \n\na joint, as explained in section 3.6), so the path through which water must flow is longer. \n\nLonger paths lead to greater losses of hydraulic head and, consequently, to lower discharges. \n\nIn order to analyse seepage in the foundation of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam with the code UDEC a finer \n\nmesh should be used. For the safety assessment, however, a coarse mesh with an average zone \n\nsize of 5.0 m \u00d7 5.0 m is sufficient. \n\n\n\n 355 \n\nThe grout curtain was simulated by changing the permeability of the joints in the grouted \n\narea, in such a way that it is 10 times less pervious than the surrounding rock mass, as in the \n\nFLAC model. In this latter model the grout curtain was simulated by a band of elements 1 m \n\nwide. Here, the joint pattern is not regular, and thus the grouted area has different widths at \n\ndifferent levels. The joint permeability constant at the grouted area was estimated taking into \n\naccount the average width of the grout curtain, which is 3.94 m: as the grout curtain is wider \n\nthan in the FLAC model, the permeability has to be greater. The dam/foundation interface \n\nwas assumed to be two times less pervious than rock joints, because it involves only to 2.5 m \n\nof rock mass foundation in the vertical direction. At the grouted area, the permeability of the \n\ndam/foundation interface was also reduced by half. The drainage system was simulated by \n\nassigning domain water pressures along the drain axis, equivalent to 1/3 of the sum of the \n\nreservoir and tailwater hydraulic heads. Care was taken in order to define the drainage system \n\nwithout including rock mass vertical joints. At this stage of the modelling process, results \n\nwere compared with those obtained with the FLAC model shown in Figure 7.1 a). In this \n\nlatter model, the numerical value of the discharge at the dam drains was about 40 % of the \n\nrecorded discharge whereas in the UDEC model, it is around 49 %. Finally, to simulate the \n\nmain flow path, the horizontal discontinuity located 5.0 m below the dam/foundation interface \n\nwas assumed to be more pervious than the other rock mass discontinuities, in the same area as \n\nthat assumed in the FLAC final model (Figure 7.1 c). In the code UDEC, the permeability of a \n\ngiven joint can be changed either by varying the joint aperture, or by multiplying the \n\ntheoretical value of the joint permeability factor (kj) by another factor (?). The latter was used \n\nin this analysis and thus the joint permeability factor (kj) in the layer of higher permeability \n\nwas adjusted in order for the numerical drain discharge to be the same as that recorded. The \n\nadjusted joint permeability factor assumed in the various discontinuities is shown in Table \n\n7.4. \n\nHydromechanical analysis was afterwards carried out with the following apertures: \n\na0 = 0.1668 mm and ares = 0.05 mm, a0 being the aperture that led to the recorded discharge.  \n\n \n\nDiscontinuities Joint permeability factor \n\n (\u00d7 10\n8\n MPa\n\n-1\ns\n\n-1\n) \n\nDam construction joints 0.0 \n\nRock joints 0.83 \n\nRock joints in the grouted area 0.327 \n\nDam/foundation joint 0.415 \n\nDam/foundation joint at the grouted area 0.16351 \n\nHorizontal discontinuity of higher permeability 6.8475 \n\nTable 7.4 \u2013 Joint permeability factor in discontinuities. \n\n\n\n   356 \n\nTo take into account the uncertainty in joint normal stiffness, new analysis was carried out \n\nassuming rock masses with different deformability (kn 5 times higher and 5 times lower than \n\nthat assumed in the base run). Using equation 6.17, the rock mass in which the normal \n\nstiffness of discontinuities is assumed to be 2 GPa/m has an equivalent deformability of \n\n5 GPa, that with kn = 10 GPa/m an equivalent deformability of 8.33 GPa and the stiffest \n\nfoundation, with kn = 50 GPa/m, an equivalent deformability of 9.6 GPa (Table 7.5). In every \n\nrun, the same amax and ares were assumed and a0 was that which, in each analysis, led to the \n\nrecorded discharge (a0 = 0.1313 mm for kn = 50 GPa/m and a0 = 0.4287 mm for \n\nkn = 2 GPa/m). In this way, the same situation is simulated with different models, which \n\nenables comparison of water pressures and apertures along the base of the dam or along other \n\nrock mass discontinuities.  \n\n7.3.4 Results analysis \n\n7.3.4.1 Stresses and displacements due to both rock mass and dam weight  \n\nAt the first stage of analysis, stresses due to both rock mass and dam weight were obtained \n\n(Figure 7.5). Analysis started from a given linear state of stress, close to the in situ state of \n\nstress due to rock mass weight. It was thus assumed that the vertical in situ stress was the \n\nweight of the overburden, using the rock mass surface upstream from the dam as the reference \n\nlevel, and that the ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses was 0.5. Results show a realistic \n\nstress pattern with vertical stresses increasing with depth. In foundation blocks close to the \n\nbase of the dam, stresses are higher below the heel of the dam, where an average compressive \n\nstress of around 0.83 MPa is determined, which is of the same order as that roughly estimated \n\ndue to dam weight (2400 kg/m\n3\n \u00d7 10 m/s\n\n2\n \u00d7 34 m = 0.8 MPa). Displacements at this phase of \n\nanalysis are shown in Figure 7.6. These displacements are only due to the dam weight and to \n\nthe weight of the upper part of the rock mass, downstream from the stilling basin (rock mass \n\nat an elevation higher than the above-mentioned reference level). The crest of the dam moves \n\ndownwards and towards upstream, with a displacement of 4.3 mm. \n\n7.3.4.2 Hydrostatic loading  \n\nPrincipal stresses at the second phase of analysis are shown in Figure 7.7 and displacements \n\nof the dam/foundation system are shown in Figure 7.8. As expected, stresses on the rock mass \n\nsurface upstream from the dam increase, as do those in the downstream area of the dam close \n\nto the stilling basin. Below the heel of the dam, close to the dam/foundation interface, stresses \n\ndecrease by around 0.3 MPa, due to dam load and consequent dam rotation towards \n\ndownstream. Gridpoint displacements were reset at the beginning of this loading stage, thus \n\ndisplacements shown are due only to hydrostatic loading. At the crest of the dam the \n\ndisplacement is practically horizontal and is 1.87 mm.  \n\n\n\n 357 \n\nJoint normal stiffness (kn) Equivalent deformability \n\n(GPa) (GPa) \n\n2 5 \n\n10 8.33 \n\n50 9.6 \n\nTable 7.5 \u2013 Equivalent deformability of the assumed rock masses. \n\n \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   27-May-09  16:03\n\n  cycle      3000 \n\n  time  =  1.299E+00 sec\n\nprincipal stresses         \n\n       minimum = -2.362E+00\n\n       maximum =  1.661E-01\n\n0  1E  1      \n\nboundary plot              \n\n-1.000\n\n-0.800\n\n-0.600\n\n-0.400\n\n-0.200\n\n 0.000\n\n 0.200\n\n 0.400\n\n 0.600\n\n(*10^2)\n\n-0.500 -0.300 -0.100  0.100  0.300  0.500  0.700  0.900  1.100\n\n(*10^2)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (blocks)                                                                       \n\nLNEC -

In these figures, the line thickness is proportional to the pressure and to the flow rate in \n\nthe fracture, respectively. When the coupling between stress and flow is taken into account, \n\ndomain water pressures are higher in the foundation area upstream from the dam and lower in \n\nthe downstream area, and the maximum water pressure is around 10 % higher (Figure 7.9 a \n\nand b). Without drainage, domain pressures increase below the dam (Figure 7.9 c). The flow \n\npattern in steady-state conditions shows that the majority of the flow is concentrated in the \n\nfirst two vertical joints upstream from the heel of the dam, and that this water flows towards \n\n\n\n 359 \n\nthe drain, or towards downstream in the foundation with no drainage system, along the joint \n\nof higher permeability that crosses the grout curtain (Figure 7.10). When the HM interaction \n\nis taken into account, flow rates are higher at lower levels and a higher quantity of water \n\nflows into the model through the second vertical joint upstream from the heel of the dam, \n\nrather than through the first as is the case in the run where joint aperture remains constant. \n\nThis depends on the increase in water pressure in a given vertical joint, which causes the \n\nclosure of adjacent vertical joints. The maximum flow rate is slightly higher when the \n\ninteraction is taken into account (it varies from around 1.21 to 1.25 (l/min)/m). Flow rates \n\nbelow 3.0 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n (m\n3\n/s)/m (0.18 (l/min)/m) are not represented. The quantity of water that \n\nflows through the model in the analysis with no drainage system and constant joint aperture is \n\n0.57 (l/min)/m. This increases by around 248 %, to 1.40 (l/min)/m, in the case of the most \n\ndeformable foundation, and decreases by around 26 %, to 0.42 (l/min)/m, in the case of the \n\nstiffest foundation. Figure 7.11 shows a detail of dam and foundation deformation due to \n\na) dam weight and the weight of the upper part of the rock mass, downstream from the stilling \n\nbasin; b) hydrostatic loading and flow; and c) both the above-mentioned effects together. In \n\nthis figure block deformation is magnified 3000 times. \n\nFigure 7.12 shows the joints that are at shear limit, those with zero normal force or stress and \n\nthe magnitude of joint separation due to mechanical deformation, for the three foundation \n\nmodels with different deformability, taking into account the HM interaction. Analogous \n\nresults are shown in Figure 7.13 for the same foundations, this time with no drainage system. \n\nFigure 7.12 shows that some sliding occurs in the upper part of the rock mass joint dipping \n\n25\u00b0 towards upstream, that the number of vertical joints that are at shear limit increases \n\ntowards downstream for stiffer foundations, and, as expected, that joint separation is lower for \n\nless deformable foundations. In the three different foundation models, the second joint \n\nupstream from the heel of the dam has an aperture due to mechanical deformation higher than \n\nthe first, because it is linked to the two lower vertical joint tracks in a nearly continuous line, \n\nas can be seen in Figure 7.4, which makes joint opening easier. Without drainage, the number \n\nof vertical joints at shear limit and with zero normal force or stress increases towards \n\ndownstream and goes down to deeper foundation areas (Figure 7.13). In this case, the first \n\nhorizontal joint below reservoir bottom, which has an area of higher permeability to simulate \n\nthe main flow path, is at shear limit below the downstream area of the base of the dam. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   360 \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   28-May-09  11:54\n\n  cycle     18000 \n\n  time  =  7.796E+00 sec\n\n  flow time = 7.796E+00 sec\n\nboundary plot              \n\ndomain pore pressures      \n\nmaximum pressure= 1.002E+00\n\neach line thick = 2.200E-01\n\n-1.000\n\n-0.800\n\n-0.600\n\n-0.400\n\n-0.200\n\n 0.000\n\n 0.200\n\n 0.400\n\n 0.600\n\n(*10^2)\n\n-0.500 -0.300 -0.100  0.100  0.300  0.500  0.700  0.900  1.100\n\n(*10^2)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (phase2)                                                                       \n\nLNEC -

The jagged shape of the curves is due to \n\nblock rotation, and the magnitude of normal displacement depends on the normal stiffness of \n\ndiscontinuities. In the first phase of analysis the point at which the dam/foundation joint \n\ncloses more is below the heel of the dam, due to dam weight, as shown in Figure 7.11 a). In \n\nthe foundation in which the joint normal stiffness is 10 GPa/m, joint closure at this point is \n\n0.221 mm. Taking this as reference, joint closure is around 3.7 times greater in the most \n\ndeformable foundation, in which kn = 2 GPa/m, and 3.8 times lower in the stiffest foundation. \n\nIn the second phase of analysis, water pressures cause both a decrease in normal \n\ndisplacements and an increase in blocks rotation. The peaks like those highlighted with *, \n\nwhich are more evident on the chart concerning the stiffest foundation, are due to the \n\nnumerical discretization, because the upper corners of the foundation blocks do not coincide \n\nwith the grid-points of the internal mesh of the dam deformable block adjacent to the \n\ndam/foundation interface. \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   28-May-09  11:54\n\n  cycle     18000 \n\n  time  =  7.796E+00 sec\n\n  flow time = 7.796E+00 sec\n\nboundary plot              \n\nflow rates                 \n\nmax flow rate =   2.011E-05\n\neach line thick = 3.000E-06\n\n-2.500\n\n-1.500\n\n-0.500\n\n 0.500\n\n 1.500\n\n 2.500\n\n 3.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\n-1.500 -0.500  0.500  1.500  2.500  3.500  4.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (phase2)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                              \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   29-May-09  18:14\n\n  cycle     18000 \n\n  time  =  7.796E+00 sec\n\n  flow time = 7.796E+00 sec\n\nboundary plot              \n\nflow rates                 \n\nmax flow rate =   2.089E-05\n\neach line thick = 3.000E-06\n\n-2.500\n\n-1.500\n\n-0.500\n\n 0.500\n\n 1.500\n\n 2.500\n\n 3.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\n-1.500 -0.500  0.500  1.500  2.500  3.500  4.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (phase4)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                              \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n    2-Jun-09   5:37\n\n  cycle     33000 \n\n  time  =  1.429E+01 sec\n\n  flow time = 1.429E+01 sec\n\nboundary plot              \n\nflow rates                 \n\nmax flow rate =   4.966E-06\n\neach line thick = 3.000E-06\n\n-2.500\n\n-1.500\n\n-0.500\n\n 0.500\n\n 1.500\n\n 2.500\n\n 3.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\n-1.500 -0.500  0.500  1.500  2.500  3.500  4.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\nJOB TITLE :                                                                                 \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                              \n\na) b) \n\nc) \n\n\n\n   362 \n\nFigure 7.15 shows the hydraulic aperture of the dam/foundation joint in the studied situations, \n\ngiven by Equation 7.2, with ares as the minimum value.

The variation of water pressures along the dam/foundation joint \n\nand along the first horizontal joint below the dam in the area of higher permeability is shown \n\nin Figure 7.16. Results obtained with the foundations of different deformability are presented. \n\nIn the hydraulic analysis in which the HM effect is not taken into account, variations in uplift \n\npressures along both the interface and the foundation discontinuities are the same regardless \n\nof the foundation deformability, because the joint hydraulic aperture remains constant. Figure \n\n7.16 shows that variations in water pressures are highly dependent on the pressure on the \n\ndrainage line. Upstream from this line, water pressures are higher for more deformable \n\nfoundations. Downstream from the drainage line, on the contrary, water pressures are higher \n\nfor stiffer rock masses. Along the dam/foundation joint, if all the drains are clogged, the \n\nhighest water pressures are obtained with the stiffest foundation, and the lowest with the most \n\ndeformable rock mass. \n\nFigure 7.17 shows a comparison of water pressures along the dam/foundation joint with both \n\nbi-linear and linear uplift distribution, usually used in stability analysis of dams with and \n\n\n\n 367 \n\nwithout drainage systems, respectively. In the case of drained foundations, the water pressure \n\ncurves are close to the bi-linear distribution. In this case, computed water pressures between \n\nthe heel of the dam and the drainage line are lower than those given by the bi-linear \n\ndistribution, whereas between the drainage line and the toe of the dam they are higher, except \n\nfor the most deformable foundation. In the case of the stiffest foundations with no drainage \n\nsystem, calculated uplift pressures are lower than those obtained with the linear distribution, \n\nto a distance of around 8.0 m from the heel of the dam, and downstream from this point they \n\nare considerably higher. At the dam/foundation joint end close to the toe of the dam, UDEC \n\nwater pressures are higher than those assumed with the linear distribution of pressures, due to \n\nthe presence of the rock wedge downstream from the dam. For the most deformable \n\nfoundation, the linear distribution of uplift pressures greatly overestimates pressures along the \n\nbase of the dam, with the exception of an area with a length of around 6.0 m, close to the toe \n\nof the dam. \n\n7.3.4.6 Joint dilatancy \n\nJoint dilation is effective when the joint is slipping and can be modelled in different ways. \n\nThe simplest way is by specifying a dilation angle and the dilation increases indefinitely \n\nirrespective of the joint loading path (Figure 7.18 a). In the UDEC code the normal \n\ndisplacement increment due to dilation, is calculated as: \n\nzdiluifusignuiu\nsss\n\nd\n\nn\n???? tan\n\n \n\nzdiluifu\ns\n\nd\n\nn\n??? 0\n\n \n\n(7.5) \n\nwhere zdil is a parameter that allows the control of maximum dilation. Dilation is zero for \n\nshear displacements higher than zdil (Figure 7.18 b) and is positive if the shear displacement \n\nincrement (?us) is in the direction of the total shear displacement (us), and negative otherwise. \n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2, the separation during shear displacement due to dilation causes an \n\nincrease in joint hydraulic apertures and consequently, an increase in joint permeability. \n\nIn the analysis presented in the preceding sections, hydrostatic loading corresponding to full \n\nreservoir was applied in a single stage. However, due to the non-linear effects, hydrostatic \n\nloading is better applied in small increments, and therefore, to investigate the dilation effect, \n\nhydrostatic loading was applied in increments of 5 m. The effect of dilatancy on discharges in \n\na loading cycle was analysed, using a dilatancy angle of 10\u00b0. In this case, shear displacements \n\nare small and thus the effect of dilatancy is small. Analysis led to the conclusion that the \n\ndischarge is the same for the full reservoir level in the foundations in which it is assumed that \n\nkn = 10 GPa/m and ? = 30\u00b0. However, if a friction angle (?) equal to 15\u00b0 is assumed, joint \n\nsliding increases and thus the dilation effect is more evident (Figure 7.19). However, a friction \n\nangle of 15\u00b0 is too low, and not likely to occur in practice. \n\n\n\n   368 \n\na) Dam/foundation interface - domain pressures\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 35.0 40.0 45.0 50.0\n\nDistance from the heel along the base of the dam (m)\n\nD\no\n\nm\na\n\nin\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nx\n 1\n\n0\n-1\n\n M\nP\n\na\n)\n\n \n\nb) joint of higher permeability - domain pressures\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n-5.0 0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 35.0 40.0\n\nx-coordinate along the horizontal joint of higher permeability (m)\n\nD\no\n\nm\na\n\nin\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nx\n 1\n\n0\n-1\n\n M\nP\n\na\n)\n\n \n\nDam/foundation interface - domain pressures\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0\n\nDistance from the heel of the dam along the foundation joint (m)\n\nD\no\n\nm\na\n\nin\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nx\n 1\n\n0\n-1\n\n M\nP\n\na\n)\n\nconstant joint aperture constant joint aperture, no drainage system\n\nHM interaction (kn = 2 GPa/m) HM interaction, no drainage system (kn = 2 GPa/m)\n\nHM interaction (kn = 10 GPa/m) HM interaction, no drainage system (kn = 10 GPa/m)\n\nHM interaction (kn = 50 GPa/m) HM interaction, no drainage system (kn = 50 GPa/m)  \n\nFigure 7.16 - Water pressure along the a) dam/foundation joint and b) joint of higher \n\npermeability. \n\n\n\n 369 \n\nDam/foundation interface - domain pressures\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 35.0 40.0 45.0 50.0\n\nDistance from the heel along the base of the dam (m)\n\nD\no\n\nm\na\n\nin\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nx\n 1\n\n0\n-1\n\n M\nP\n\na\n)\n\nbi-linear distribution \n\nof uplift pressures \n\nlinear distribution \n\nof uplift pressures \n\n \n\nDam/foundation interface - domain pressures\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0\n\nDistance from the heel of the dam along the foundation joint (m)\n\nD\no\n\nm\na\n\nin\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nx\n 1\n\n0\n-1\n\n M\nP\n\na\n)\n\nconstant joint aperture constant joint aperture, no drainage system\n\nHM interaction (kn = 2 GPa/m) HM interaction, no drainage system (kn = 2 GPa/m)\n\nHM interaction (kn = 10 GPa/m) HM interaction, no drainage system (kn = 10 GPa/m)\n\nHM interaction (kn = 50 GPa/m) HM interaction, no drainage system (kn = 50 GPa/m)  \n\nFigure 7.17 \u2013 Comparison of water pressures along the dam/foundation joint with both \n\nbi-linear and linear distribution of water pressures. \n\n \n\na) b)  \n\n?s\n\nus\n\nus us\n\nus\n\n?u n\nd\n\nzdil\n\n?s\n\n?u n\nd\n\nii\n\n \n\n?s\n\nus\n\nus us\n\nus\n\n?u n\nd\n\nzdil\n\n?s\n\n?u n\nd\n\nii\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n?s \u2013 shear stress \n\n \n\nus \u2013 shear displacement \n\n \n\n(1) \u2013  elastic behaviour (zero \n\ndilation) \n\n \n\n?un\nd\n \u2013 normal displacement \n\nincrement due to dilation \n\n \n\nzdil \u2013 shear displacement for \n\nzero dilation  \n\n \n\nFigure 7.18 \u2013 Models for joint dilation: a) the dilation increases indefinitely; b) UDEC model. \n\n \n\n \n\n(1) (1) \n\n\n\n   370 \n\n0.00\n\n0.20\n\n0.40\n\n0.60\n\n0.80\n\n1.00\n\n1.20\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\nReservoir level (m)\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)/\n\nm\n)\n\n   friction angle = 30\u00ba\n\n   friction angle 30\u00ba;  dilation angle = 10\u00ba\n\n \n\n0.00\n\n0.20\n\n0.40\n\n0.60\n\n0.80\n\n1.00\n\n1.20\n\n1.40\n\n1.60\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\nReservoir level (m)\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n (\n\n(l\n/m\n\nin\n)/\n\nm\n)\n\n   friction angle = 15\u00ba\n\n   friction angle 15\u00ba;  dilation angle = 10\u00ba\n\n \n\nFigure 7.19 \u2013 Drain discharges during the filling of the reservoir both without and with joint \n\ndilation effect for two different joint friction angles.  \n\n7.3.5 Comparison of monitored and numerical hydraulic heads at the \n\npiezometers located underneath the stilling basin \n\nThere are vertical boreholes with two piezometric chambers located in blocks 4B-5, 5B-6, \n\n6A-6B and 7-8, in the downstream area, underneath the stilling basin (Figure 4.21). Figure \n\n7.20 shows the hydraulic head in these piezometers plotted versus time. The length of \n\npiezometric chambers varies from 0.75 m to 2.55 m. Figure analysis shows that the hydraulic \n\n\n\n 371 \n\nhead varies with changes in the reservoir level and that it is higher in the piezometric \n\nchambers located at lower levels, further away from the dam/foundation interface. This \n\nvariation is approximately linear, although readings are widely scattered for the highest \n\nreservoir levels (Figure 7.21), for which there are more readings.  \n\nThe difference between the hydraulic head in the lower chamber and that in the upper one is \n\naround 0.5 m in block 4B-5, around 0.8 m in block 7A-8, around 2.0 m in block 5B-6 and is \n\nas high as around 4.5 m in block 6A-6B. Results of both FLAC and UDEC models are \n\nconsistent, showing that the variation in water pressures in the foundation area underneath the \n\nstilling basin is hydrostatic (i.e. the hydraulic head is the same at points located at different \n\nlevels), and this approximately simulates what is observed in blocks 4B-5 and 7A-8. \n\nHowever, the high differences between readings taken in the lower and upper chambers in \n\nblocks 5B-6 and 6A-6B show that recorded water pressures are mainly dependent on local \n\nconditions, which are not represented in the model. The following paragraph describes the \n\nchanges introduced into the model in order to try to make numerical results correspond more \n\nclosely to measurements taken in block 6A-6B, where the differences are higher.

An attempt was made to obtain hydraulic \n\nheads closer to those recorded in this block by changing the developed UDEC model. Firstly, \n\nas the lower piezometric chambers are located at around 10.3 m below the dam/foundation \n\ninterface, the layer of higher permeability was assumed to be located 10.0 m below this \n\ninterface, instead of the previously assumed 5.0 m. The length of this layer was gradually \n\nincreased, which led to higher water pressures at the downstream area. These varied from \n\naround 66.1 m to 67.9 m, depending on the layer\u2019s length. However, below the stilling basin \n\nthe variation in pressure remained hydrostatic. Secondly, the permeability of the vertical \n\ndiscontinuities was increased 5 times, except in the grouted area, where they remained as \n\npervious as the horizontal ones. This decision was made because the model\u2019s vertical \n\ndiscontinuities are not continuous, and therefore the rock mass permeability in the vertical \n\ndirection is lower. It was concluded that this increase did not alter the rock mass global \n\npermeability, because, as vertical joints are discontinuous, water must always flow through \n\nthe set of horizontal discontinuities. Finally, results analysis led to the conclusion that the \n\nlower hydraulic head recorded at the upper piezometric chambers is almost certainly due to \n\nleakage through dam vertical joints. To simulate this leakage, the permeability of the \n\ndownstream area of the dam/foundation joint, close to the toe of the dam, was gradually \n\nincreased. However, the maximum numerical difference in water pressures between the lower \n\nand upper piezometric chambers was 0.8 m (Table 7.6). \n\nRegarding the model, it was concluded that results closer to those recorded might be obtained \n\nif it was assumed that the majority of the water flows through sub-horizontal discontinuities \n\nthat are interconnected only in some areas of the dam foundation.  \n\n \n\nJoint permeability factor of \n\nthe downstream area of the \n\ndam/foundation joint \n\nNumerical hydraulic head  \n\n(m) \n\nDifference between the \n\nnumerical hydraulic heads at \n\nthe lower and upper chambers \n\n(\u00d7 10\n8\n MPa\n\n-1\ns\n\n-1\n) upper chamber lower chamber (m) \n\n0.415 67.7 67.7 0.0 \n\n6.8475 65.8 66.5 0.7 \n\n13.695 65.5 66.2 0.7 \n\n27.39 65.3 66.0 0.7 \n\n54.78 65.1 65.9 0.8 \n\n109.56 65.0 65.8 0.8 \n\nTable 7.6 \u2013 Difference between numerical hydraulic heads at the lower and upper piezometric \n\nchambers for different permeabilities of the downstream area of the dam/foundation joint. \n\n\n\n   374 \n\nIn reality, several springs were identified at the dam site whilst excavating, which are shown \n\non the surface foundation map. The water from these springs was collected in two different \n\nwells, but it was not diverted from the base of the dam to the area downstream from the dam. \n\nInstead, the wells were covered with a layer of conventional concrete. The water from these \n\nsprings is probably increasing water pressures within the foundation and, consequently, \n\nincreasing the hydraulic head. Since the beginning of the first filling of the reservoir, it has \n\nbeen observed that a relatively high quantity of water appears at the downstream sidewall and \n\nfloor of the gallery close to dam vertical contraction joints 4 to 7. The water probably flows \n\nfrom the dam foundation through the dam contraction joints, due to misplacement of the \n\nsealing strips. This can explain the difference in hydraulic head recorded in the lower and \n\nupper piezometric chambers in some foundation areas. \n\n7.4 Stability analysis \n\n7.4.1 Introduction \n\nFor rock foundations, stability analysis requires that possible sliding block mechanisms which \n\nmay lead to failure be identified (ICOLD 1993; Londe 1985). These involve the \n\ndam/foundation interface, rock mass joints and/or planes of weakness. Wyllie (1999) \n\nhighlights that in general stability conditions are unfavourable if the discontinuities are \n\ncontinuous and planar, contain a low strength or brittle infilling and have positions and \n\norientations that form a wedge of rock that can slide from the foundation. Instability may \n\noccur underneath the dam, in the abutments or in adjacent slopes. \n\nThis section starts by briefly describing the main accident scenarios of different dam types \n\nand the available stability analysis methods for gravity dams. The safety of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam \n\nagainst dam base sliding is afterwards assessed with the limit equilibrium method, following \n\nthe Portuguese guidelines for dam design. Water pressures along the dam/foundation joint, \n\nshown in Figure 7.16, were used to assess the safety of the stilling basin against upsurge. \n\nFinally, the stability of the dam/foundation system was estimated for different possible failure \n\nscenarios, using the UDEC model developed and the strength reduction method. \n\n7.4.2 Main accident scenarios of different dam types \n\n7.4.2.1 Gravity dams \n\nThe main loads in gravity dams are the self-weight and water pressures (hydraulic pressures \n\nand uplift). The dam/foundation interface is very large, therefore, uplift pressures at the base \n\nof the dam and hydraulic pressures play an important role, as they reduce the stabilizing effect \n\nof the structure weight. Such hydraulic pressures can occur in rock mass discontinuities or \n\n\n\n 375 \n\neven in the dam body, if there is any deficiency in construction joints, or fissures in contact \n\nwith the reservoir. Temperature variations are only important during the construction stage. In \n\ngravity dams earthquakes can cause various sliding mechanisms in addition to high tensile \n\nstresses, particularly close to the crest. \n\nThe stresses on the foundations of gravity dams are relatively low so failure of the intact rock \n\nmaterial is unlikely and the behaviour of the rock mass is controlled by sliding either along \n\nthe dam/concrete interface or along sub-horizontal weak layers in the foundation, close to the \n\nbase of the dam. Depending on the geometrical and mechanical properties of the foundation \n\ndiscontinuities and on uplift distribution on those surfaces, other failure scenarios can occur, \n\nsuch as overturning around a left abutment/right abutment axis. \n\nThe failure of Austin dam, in the USA in 1911, is an example of concrete gravity dam failure \n\ndue to sliding along a layer of shale, which was the weakest zone in the foundation (Greene \n\nand Christ 1998). The dam was about 165 m in length and 15 m high. The foundation \n\nconsisted of horizontally layered sedimentary rocks, principally sandstone and shale. Prior to \n\nconcreting, excavation was very shallow and only 1.2 m of shale needed to be excavated to \n\nreach the sandstone. However, the thickness of the sandstone layer was only 0.6 m, which was \n\nonly discovered after the dam failure. The dam designer had planned a foundation cutoff wall \n\nthat was to be taken to a sufficient depth into bedrock to prevent underseepage, but this had \n\nnot been built. According to Greene and Christ (1998) had the dam\u00b4s foundation been taken \n\ndeeper into bedrock, below the shale layer, the dam\u2019s stability would have been significantly \n\nenhanced.  \n\n7.4.2.2 Buttress dams \n\nIn buttress dams the water load is transmitted to triangular buttresses parallel to the direction \n\nof the river flow. These resistant elements are isolated blocks, which theoretically work in an \n\nisolated way, allowing fitting to different geotechnical conditions along the foundation. The \n\ncontinuity of the upstream face can be assured either by a thickening of the buttress\u2019 heads or \n\nby small arches. The spaces between buttresses allow the discharge of water seeping through \n\nthe foundation, thus greatly reducing uplift pressures. The dam/foundation interface is much \n\nsmaller than in massive gravity dams and stresses on the foundation are higher; therefore \n\nfailure scenarios related to block sliding are more likely to occur. Failure scenarios are similar \n\nto those mentioned for gravity dams, but failure of an isolated block is more likely to occur, \n\ndue to the less effective linking three-dimensional effect and because this type of dam is often \n\nbuilt in valleys with heterogeneous foundation rock masses. In addition to these failure \n\nscenarios, problems related to slenderness shall also be taken into account, such as the \n\ninstability of buttresses or connecting structures. \n\n\n\n   376 \n\n7.4.2.3 Arch dams \n\nArch dams are curved structures, with their convexity towards upstream, designed to transmit \n\nwater thrust mainly to the abutments and not to the valley bottom, taking advantage both of \n\nconcrete and foundation rock mass compression strength (Veltrop 1988). Therefore, in the \n\nsafety assessment of these dams it is essential to know the maximum stresses and the \n\nmechanical resistance of concrete and rock mass foundation, particularly in the slopes. In arch \n\ndams the dam/foundation interface is relatively small when compared to gravity dams and \n\nuplift pressures do not in general affect safety. However it is of major importance to reduce \n\nseepage under the dam in order to reduce erosion. The main accident scenarios are: 1) sliding \n\nalong weaker surfaces in the foundation area where the arches rest, particularly in the valley \n\nsides and in the abutments; ii) crushing of the upper central arch area, where high \n\ncompression stresses can occur and shear scenarios can develop; and iii) seepage in the valley \n\nbottom, which leads to erosion of discontinuities. \n\nThere are some reported cases of arch dam failure due to the rock mass foundation behaviour \n\nof which the most well-known case is the failure of the 61 m high Malpasset dam, in France \n\nin 1959, which is briefly described in chapter 2, section 2.5.3.  \n\n7.4.2.4 Other types of  dams \n\nIn addition to gravity, buttress and arch dams, other types are also built, which combine the \n\ncharacteristics of those previously mentioned: arch-gravity, multiple arch and composite \n\ndams. Arch-gravity dams take advantage of a significant curvature in plan, although they are \n\nvery thick in order to reduce stresses on the foundation. Multiple arch dams consist of a \n\nnumber of arches bearing on buttresses and the foundation (Pedro 1977). Multiple arch dams \n\nof large span are usually built in valleys where the ratio span-height is very large. Composite \n\ndams include not only the dams with linked concrete and embankment areas but also dams \n\nwhich join different types of concrete structures. In arch gravity dams and in large-span \n\nmultiple arch dams the failure scenarios to consider are, basically, the failure scenarios of the \n\nmain types of dams. Therefore, taking into account specific features of each structure, in arch-\n\ngravity dams, failure scenarios associated with both gravity and arch dams must be \n\nconsidered, and in large-span multiple arch dams special attention must be given to failure \n\nscenarios associated with both arch and buttresses dams. In composite dams special attention \n\nmust be given to the part where the different structural areas are linked.  \n\nAn example of concrete arch-gravity dam failure is that of the 64 m high St. Francis dam, in \n\nthe USA in 1928. Analysis carried out immediately after the disaster pointed to piping of \n\nmaterial along a fault, about halfway up the right abutment, as being the cause of failure. \n\n\n\n 377 \n\nSubsequent studies suggested that dam failure involved the partial reactivation of an ancient \n\nbedrock landslide which comprised the dam\u2019s entire left abutment (Rogers 2006).  \n\n7.4.3 Stability analysis methods for gravity dams \n\nThe limit equilibrium approach has been widely used to evaluate dam foundation stability, \n\nand considerable experience has been accumulated with its application. The dam is assumed \n\nto be a rigid body and the method consists of assuming a simplified failure mode and \n\ncalculating the driving and resisting forces acting on the sliding surface, with the ratio of these \n\ntwo forces being the safety factor (F). Regarding the stability evaluation of gravity dams, \n\ndifferent criteria have been adopted by different bodies, and great effort has been made in \n\norder to analyse the differences in the results (CFBR 2006; European Club of ICOLD 2004a; \n\nEuropean Club of ICOLD 2004b; FERC 2002; USACE 2000; USACE 2005). These \n\ndifferences are mainly related with different ways of simulating the distribution of uplift \n\npressures along the base of the dam, the possibility of crack formation and propagation along \n\nthe dam/foundation interface and stability criteria, expressed in terms of either minimum \n\nvalues for the safety factors or maximum allowable stresses. A comprehensive computer \n\nprogram to perform both static and seismic stability evaluation of gravity dams was \n\ndeveloped at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, with the aim of providing learning support \n\nand a basis for research and development on the subject (Leclerc et al. 2003). The program, \n\nCADAM, which is freely available, includes a large number of modelling options, as it is \n\npossible to carry out stability analysis using different worldwide published dam safety \n\nguidelines. \n\nTwo-dimensional analysis is generally adequate for most gravity dams (Rocha 1980a; Rocha \n\n1980b), though with some exceptions including cases where the dam height is variable along \n\nits axis and some in which the geotechnical conditions are not uniform (Bustamante and \n\nRadisic 2006; Lombardi 2007). However, for arch dams 3D analysis is always required, as, in \n\nthis case, failure mechanisms involve intersecting planes which can not be modelled two-\n\ndimensionally. Lemos (1999b) highlights that a significant difference with respect to the 2D \n\ncase is that the failure surfaces for arch dam foundations tend to intercept the concrete \n\nstructure, and various local mechanisms need to be examined. The limit equilibrium method \n\nallows estimates of the margin of safety to be obtained but does not give an indication of the \n\nmagnitude of shear displacements as instability is approached. Analysis carried out with the \n\nFinite Element Method (FEM), may be used to estimate both shear deformations and margin \n\nof safety (e.g. Alonso et al. 1994; Shahkarami et al. 2004; Wittke 1990; Wittke and Polczyk \n\n2002; Wittke et al. 2003). In this type of analysis, discontinuities along which sliding may \n\ntake place can be modelled using special interface elements. Continuum codes not based on \n\nthe FEM, such as FLAC, can also be used to assess both static and dynamic stability of \n\ngravity dams (e.g. Bureau 2006). However, stability analysis of dam foundations is better \n\n\n\n   378 \n\ncarried out with block models, which may or may not include fluid flow through the \n\ndiscontinuities. \n\nStability evaluation using the DEM may be carried out applying suitable water pressures on \n\npotential sliding surfaces, calculated with a simple uncoupled flow analysis, in order to \n\nprovide worst case scenarios (Lemos 1999b).  The reliability of the application of the DEM to \n\nthe study of sliding in jointed rock masses has been proven by comparing numerical results \n\nwith both analytical solutions and experimental data.  Studies which addressed failure of \n\ngravity dams on multiple discontinuities were carried out, as shown in Figure 7.23 (Pereira da \n\nCosta et al. 1993; Pereira Gomes et al. 1997; Pina et al. 1993). The collapse mechanism of \n\narch dams calculated with 3DEC was also compared with experimental results (Lemos 1999a; \n\nLemos 1999b; Lemos et al. 1995). Comparisons for dynamic analysis in seismic failure \n\nscenarios, using experimental results of a scale model of a gravity dam tested on LNEC\u2019s \n\nshaking table are presented in Pereira Gomes (2006) and in Lemos and Pereira Gomes (2007). \n\nAdditional data for validation of numerical models for failure scenarios is provided by a series \n\nof shear tests and shake table sliding tests recently carried out by Rochon-Cyr and L\u00e9ger \n\n(2009). \n\nStability analysis using discontinuum models that take into account the coupling between \n\nhydraulic and mechanical effects have been applied mainly for gravity dams. Some of these \n\nstudies are briefly referred to in the following paragraphs. \n\nLemos (1987) implemented a series of new features in UDEC necessary for both \n\nhydromechanical and dynamic analysis of jointed rock masses and studied the behaviour and \n\nstability of a 100 m high hypothetical gravity dam on a rock mass with 2 joint sets. A \n\nparametric study was carried out in order to investigate the influence of different factors on \n\nnumerical results. Results of seismic analysis carried out with this model (Lemos and Cundall \n\n1999) were coherent with results of laboratory experiments which were later carried out by \n\nJavanmardi et al. (2005a; 2005b) regarding transient water pressures inside a crack created in \n\na concrete specimen subjected to a cyclic dynamic movement. \n\nMostyn et al. (1997) carried out stability analysis of Chichester gravity dam, located in New \n\nSouth Wales, Australia, and the UDEC results were used to assess the accuracy of the Hoek-\n\nBrown empirical rock mass failure criterion. \n\nBarla et al. (2004) used the code UDEC to investigate the seepage conditions through the rock \n\nmass foundation of a 73 m high gravity dam in Italy, which was going to be built on a granitic \n\nfoundation, and  to  assess  its  stability. The flow patterns and pressure distributions under the \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 379 \n\na) b) \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.23 \u2013 Physical model tests of a gravity dam on a discontinuous foundation. Failure \n\nmechanisms: a) same friction angle on all joints; and b) reduced friction on lower joint (after \n\nPereira Gomes et al. 1997). \n\ndam were compared with those usually assumed in static analysis of gravity dams. \n\nComparisons of results showed that the safety factors obtained using UDEC were lower than \n\nthose obtained in FLAC analysis, in similar loading conditions.  \n\nGimenes (2000) and Gimenes and Fern\u00e1ndez (2006) performed stability analysis of Albigna \n\ngravity dam. The dam had a fairly complete foundation monitoring system (Kovari et al. \n\n1989) which allowed measured field data to be compared with UDEC results. The behaviour \n\nof both dam/foundation interface and rock mass discontinuities during reservoir filling was \n\nsimulated and the safety of the dam was evaluated for different failure scenarios. \n\nConcerning the safety factor, several definitions have been proposed as referred to in Kovari \n\nand Fritz (1989; 1993) and in Alonso et al. (1996). In all cases, it provides a measure of the \n\ndistance from the limit equilibrium, but generally, uncertainty about water pressure \n\ndistribution and shear strength parameters (cohesion and friction angle) along the slip \n\nsurfaces, for the relevant level of normal effective stresses, requires parametric studies to be \n\ncarried out. Two alternative approaches may be employed: partial safety factors and \n\nprobabilistic procedures.  The first allows the consideration of the different levels of \n\nuncertainty attached to the various actions and material properties (Lemos 1999b), as lower \n\nsafety factors may be used for better defined loads or material properties. This is a semi-\n\nprobabilistic approach and is the method prescribed in Eurocode 7 for geotechnical \n\nengineering (Maranha das Neves 1994). The second would allow us to estimate a probability \n\nof failure, taking into account the uncertainties in the different parameters (ICOLD 1993). \n\nHowever, as discussed in Lemos (1999b), the calculation of probabilities of failure in rock \n\nengineering presents serious difficulties, mainly due to the usual lack of knowledge \n\nconcerning the probability distribution functions of the material properties, and to our current \n\ninability to reproduce in numerical models statistical descriptions of the joint patterns. \n\nApproximate solutions of the probability of failure can be obtained with the reliability \n\n\n\n   380 \n\nanalysis method, briefly described in Lemos (1999b), based on simplifying assumptions about \n\nthe distributions of the random parameters involved in the limit state equation. Bernstone et \n\nal. (2009) have recently used this method to assess the safety of an operating concrete dam, \n\ntaking into account recorded uplift data. \n\n7.4.4 Stability analysis of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam \n\n7.4.4.1 Limit equilibrium approach \n\nIn a stability analysis using the limit equilibrium method the loads to take into account are the \n\nweight of the dam; the reservoir and tailwater loads; uplift water pressures; silt pressures, if \n\napplicable; and seismic loads. To assess safety against dam base sliding, usual and extreme \n\nloading combinations were used, as set out in the Portuguese guidelines for dam design (RSB \n\n2007). Usual combinations encompass different situations which may occur in normal \n\noperating conditions, while extreme loading combinations cover the conditions that may lead \n\nto possible failure scenarios. The available shear strength is expressed by a Mohr-Coulomb \n\ncriterion. The peak values of friction angle and cohesion should be used for the usual loading \n\ncombinations, and residual values for the extreme loading combinations. \n\nThe stability analysis was carried out with given minimum shear-friction safety factors at the \n\nconcrete/rock mass interface for the following different hypotheses:  \n\ni) hydraulic head at the drainage line equal to 1/3 of the sum of the reservoir and \n\ntailwater pressures or dam with no drains (linear distribution of the uplift \n\npressure);  \n\nii) cohesion c in the dam/foundation interface of 0.2 MPa or zero; and  \n\niii) including and not including the resistance from the rock wedge close to the toe of \n\nthe dam (assuming that downstream from the dam the river bottom is at its actual \n\nelevation or at the same level as the base of the dam).  \n\nSilt pressure was not taken into account. The following unit weights were used for the \n\nconcrete, foundation rock mass and water: ?c = 24 kN/m\n3\n; ?r = 25 kN/m\n\n3\n; and ?w = 10 kN/m\n\n3\n. \n\nRegarding seismic loads, the same accelerations as those used in the dam design \n\n(HIDRORUMO 2001) were employed: a = 0.06 g for the Operational Basis Earthquake \n\n(OBE) and a = 0.143 g for the Maximum Design Earthquake (MDE). For the latter, analysis \n\nwas also carried out with a higher value, a = 0.35 g, which is slightly higher than the \n\nacceleration for a surface magnitude of 6.0 at a distance of 1 km from a fault with a square \n\nfailure area with sides 7.5 km long (C\u00e2mara 2007). The effect of seismic loads is simulated by \n\napplying two additional external forces to the structure: the first is applied through the centre \n\n\n\n 381 \n\nof gravity of the structure in a downstream direction and is equal to the product of the dam \n\nweight and a seismic coefficient; the second is the hydrodynamic force exerted by the water \n\non the dam. In a first analysis the reservoir is at the level of the spillway crest (84.8 m) and \n\nthe tailwater at level 60.0 m. This is the most probable situation, as the dam has an \n\nuncontrolled spillway. A second analysis was carried out considering the maximum operating \n\nlevel (91.8 m) and a tailwater at level 67.8 m. This situation could arise during a flood. Figure \n\n7.24 shows the water static loads on block 6-7. \n\nThe hydrodynamic force on the reservoir/concrete interface, which occurs during an \n\nearthquake, is calculated with the Westergaard simplified model (Figure 7.25). In this model, \n\nit is assumed that: i) the dam is not deformable; ii) the reservoir is semi-infinite; iii) the water \n\nis incompressible; iv) the surface waves can be neglected; and v) there are only horizontal \n\nvibrations along the upstream-downstream direction. The pressure distribution is parabolic \n\nand the hydrodynamic equivalent force, whose line of action is 0.4 H above the reservoir \n\nbottom, is added to the static water pressure force to get the total water force on the structure. \n\nUSACE (2005) stresses that it is necessary to be aware of the limitations and the simplifying \n\nassumptions made with respect to hydrodynamic pressures and their distribution on the \n\nstructure, as this method can lead to significant error. However, if the primary aim of the \n\nanalysis is the foundation behaviour, the model is adequate.  \n\n \n\nMaximum water levelRetention water level\n\n67.8\n\n60.0\n\n91.8\n\n51.051.0\n\n84.8\n\n38.65.8\n\n5.8 38.6\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n338 kN/m2\n\n338 kN/m2\n\n338 kN/m2\n\n408 kN/m2\n\n408 kN/m2\n\n408 kN/m2\n\n168 kN/m2\n\n168 kN/m2\n\n90 kN/m 2\n\n90 kN/m 2\n\n142.7 kN/m 2\n\n192.0 kN/m 2\n\n90 kN/m\n2\n\n168 kN/m\n2\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n \n\n(a)   non-operational drainage system \n\n(b)   hydraulic head at the drainage line equal to 1/3 of the sum of the reservoir and tailwater pressures. \n\nFigure 7.24 \u2013 Water static loads on block 6-7 of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam. \n\n\n\n   382 \n\nH\n\np(z)\n\nz\n\n0\n\nF\n\nz\n\nws\n\nws\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFws = hydrodynamic force per unit length \n\ncm = coefficient dependent on the slope of the \n\nupstream face of the dam (cm = 0.749 for \n\nvertical upstream faces) \nz = height from the base \n?w = unit weight of water \n\nH = water height above the dam base \n\nas = horizontal acceleration of the dam \n\nfoundation \n \n\nswm\naH\n\nH\n\nz\n\nH\n\nz\nczp ?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n????\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n11\n2\n\n1\n)(\n\n \n\nswmws\naHcF ?\n\n? 2\n\n24\n\n38 ?\n?

In this table, destabilising actions are shown on the left hand size of each \n\nformula, while both stabilising actions and the shear resistance, which develops on the \n\nconcrete/rock mass interface, are shown on the right hand side. \n\nTable 7.9 shows the results of the stability analysis carried out. Although high flow rates and \n\nuplift pressures are recorded in the foundation of the dam block 6-7, the conclusion is drawn \n\nthat the base sliding stability of the dam is ensured for usual load conditions, when the \n\nreservoir is at the level of the spillway crest. At the maximum operating level, stability is not \n\nguaranteed when cohesion of the dam/foundation interface is neglected. For extreme load \n\nconditions stability is not guaranteed if drains are inoperable. In the case of seismic \n\ncombination using a = 0.143 g, stability is not ensured if drains are inoperable and if the \n\nresistance from the rock wedge at the toe of the dam is not included in the analysis. If it is \n\nassumed that the MDE is 0.35 g some shear displacement could occur during the earthquake. \n\nTherefore it can be concluded that care must be taken in order to maintain the existing \n\ndrainage system in good condition. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 383 \n\n \n\n \n\nUsual  \n\nscenarios \n\nStatic loads \n\n(retention water level) \n\nCross section weight, static loads of water for the retention water \n\nlevel (hydrostatic pressure and uplift) and part of the passive force \n\ndownstream from the dam \n\nSeismic combination \n\n(retention water level and \n\nOBE) \n\nCross section weight, static loads of water for the retention water \n\nlevel (hydrostatic pressure and uplift), part of the passive force \n\ndownstream from the dam and OBE (inertia forces on the concrete \n\nsection and hydrodynamic pressures) \n\n \n\n \n\nFailure  \n\nscenarios \n\nStatic loads \n\n(maximum water level) \n\nCross section weight, static loads of water for the maximum water \n\nlevel (hydrostatic pressure and uplift) and part of the passive force \n\ndownstream from the dam  \n\nSeismic combination \n\n(retention water level and \n\nMDE) \n\nCross section weight, static loads of water for the retention water \n\nlevel (hydrostatic pressure and uplift), part of the passive force \n\ndownstream from the dam and MDE (inertia forces on the \n\nconcrete section and hydrodynamic pressures) \n\nTable 7.7 \u2013 Loading combinations to take into account in the safety assessment against dam \n\nsliding for both usual and failure scenarios. \n\n \n\n \n\nUsual  \n\nscenarios \n\nStatic loads \n\n(retention water level) \n3\n\n)(\np\n\nwd\n\nc\n\nw\n\nF\nF\n\nc\nL\n\ntg\nVWF ?????\n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n\n \n\nSeismic combination \n\n(retention water level and \n\nOBE) 3\n)(\n\np\n\nwd\n\nc\n\nbwsw\n\nF\nF\n\nc\nL\n\ntg\nVWFFF ???????\n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n\n \n\n \n\nFailure  \n\nscenarios  \n\nStatic loads \n\n(maximum water level) \n3\n\n)(\np\n\nwd\nr\n\nw\n\nF\nF\n\ntg\nVWF\n\nr\n\n????\n??\n\n?\n \n\nSeismic combination \n\n(retention water level and \n\nMDE) 3\n)(\n\np\n\nwd\nr\n\nbwsw\n\nF\nF\n\ntg\nVWFFF\n\nr\n\n??????\n??\n\n?\n \n\n \n\nW = weight of the concrete cross-section \n\nV = resultant of uplift pressures at the horizontal \n\ndam/foundation interface \n\nFw = horizontal resultant of the hydrostatic pressure on the \n\nupstream face of the dam \n\nFwd = horizontal resultant of the hydrostatic pressure on the \n\ndownstream face of the dam \n\nFp = passive (resisting) force in the area of the downstream \n\nface below the river bottom \n\nFws = hydrodynamic pressure on the upstream face of the \n\ndam \n\nFb = inertia force due to the seismic load on the concrete \n\nsection \n\n? = peak friction angle on the dam/foundation joint \n\nc = cohesion \n\n?r =  residual friction angle on the dam/foundation joint \n\n \n\nL = length of the dam/foundation interface in the upstream-\n\ndownstream direction \n\n \n\n?? = safety factor relative to the peak friction angle \n\n?c = safety factor relative to cohesion \n\n??r = safety factor relative to the residual friction angle \n\nTable 7.8 \u2013 Safety assessment against sliding at the dam/foundation interface for both usual \n\nand failure scenarios. \n\n \n\n\n\n   384 \n\n \n\nHu \n\n \n\n(m) \n\n \n\nHd \n\n \n\n(m) \n\n \n\nDrainage \n\nsystem \n\n \n\nCohesion \n\nc \n\n(MPa) \n\n \n\nRiver \n\nbottom \n\ndown-\n\nstream \n\nfrom the \n\ndam \n\nUsual scenarios Failure scenarios \n\nPeak friction angle \n\n(minimum value) \n\n \n\nc = 0.2 MPa; ?c = 3.0; \n?? = 1.5 \n\nResidual friction angle \n\n(minimum value) \n\n \n\nc = 0; ??r = 1.2 \n\nStatic \n\nloads \n\n \n\nSeismic \n\nloads \n\n(retention \n\nwater level \n\nand OBE) \n\nStatic loads \n\n(maximum \n\nwater \n\nlevel) \n\nSeismic loads \n\n(retention \n\nwater level  \n\nand MDE) \n\n0.143 g 0.35 g \n\n84.8 60.0 not operative 0.0 1) - - - 47\u00b0   60\u00b0 \n\n   0.2 1) 19\u00b0 30\u00b0 - - - \n\n   0.0 2) - - - 43\u00b0 58\u00b0 \n\n   0.2 2) 10\u00b0 23\u00b0 - - - \n\n  operative 0.0 1) - -  - 38\u00b0 52\u00b0 \n\n   0.2 1) 14\u00b0 23\u00b0 - - - \n\n   0.0 2) - - - 35\u00b0 49\u00b0 \n\n   0.2 2) 8\u00b0 17\u00b0 - - - \n\n91.8 67.8 not operative 0.0 1) - - 51\u00b0 - - \n\n   0.0 2) - - 46\u00b0 - - \n\n  operative 0.0 1) - - 37\u00b0 - - \n\n   0.0 2) - - 33\u00b0 - - \n\n \n\nDownstream from the dam the river bottom is: 1) at the same level as the concrete/rock mass interface (51.0 m) \n\n2) at its actual level (59.5 m) \n\nTable 7.9 \u2013 Minimum values of the friction angle in discontinuities close to the \n\ndam/foundation interface which ensure safety against sliding. \n\n \n\nAnalysis shows that the dam is very stable. For the usual scenarios, in which it is assumed \n\nthat cohesion in the dam/foundation interface is not zero, the dam is stable even when the \n\ndrainage system is not operative. For failure scenarios, during a flood, stability is still ensured \n\nif the drainage system is working properly. This is not the case if the drainage system is \n\ninoperative, as the calculated friction angles are very high. Thus, in this case, stability is not \n\nensured. For the MDE, with the acceleration assumed in the dam design (a = 0.143 g), the \n\ndam is stable if the drains are operative. For the larger seismic loads (a = 0.35 g), some shear \n\ndisplacement could occur. The magnitude of these displacements, however, can not be \n\nobtained with the limit equilibrium approach. A step by step time domain analysis would be \n\nrequired.  \n\n\n\n 385 \n\nAdditional analysis was carried out in order to evaluate the stability of the stilling basin of \n\nPedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam, which was concreted separately from the dam body, as a series of individual \n\nblocks, as shown in Figure 7.26. Therefore it is necessary to assess its stability against \n\nupsurging due to water pressure. Figure 7.16 a) shows the variation in uplift pressures along \n\nthe base of the dam, for different foundations, with and without drainage system. These \n\npressures were used to determine the force acting upwards in the area of the stilling \n\nbasin/foundation interface, and this force was compared with the weight of the stilling basin. \n\nAnalysis was carried out for the worst scenario, of foundation with no drainage system (Table \n\n7.10). Results lead to the conclusion that the stability of the stilling basin against upsurging is \n\nensured both when the drainage system is working properly and when there is no drainage \n\nsystem but the foundation is very deformable. In situations with no drainage system, stability \n\nis at its limit in the case of a foundation with joint normal stiffness of 10 GPa/m and is not \n\nguaranteed in the case of the stiffest foundation. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.26 \u2013 Construction of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam stilling basin. \n\n \n\nModel: HM interaction, no \n\ndrainage system \n\nForce due to uplift pressure on the \n\nstilling basin/foundation interface \n\n(kN/m) \n\nPercentage of stilling basin weight (%) \n \n\n(stilling basin weight = 2904 kN/m) \n\nkn = 2 GPa/m 1990 40 \n\nkn = 10 GPa/m 2890 99.5 \n\nkn = 50 GPa/m 3320 114.3 \n\nTable 7.10 \u2013 Force due to uplift pressures acting upwards on the stilling basin/foundation \n\ninterface and comparison with the weight of the stilling basin. \n\n\n\n   386 \n\n7.4.4.2 Strength reduction method \n\nThe UDEC model developed, with joint normal stiffness of 10 GPa/m, was used to assess the \n\nstability of the dam/foundation system for the five different possible failure scenarios shown \n\nin Figure 7.27. Scenarios a) and e) concern only the dam/foundation joint. Sliding along this \n\ninterface is the most probable failure scenario in dam foundation rock masses containing \n\nwidely spaced discontinuities, none of which are unfavourably oriented. Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam is \n\nembedded in the foundation, and therefore the resistance to sliding is high. Scenario e) \n\nneglects the resistance of the rock wedge at the toe of the dam, in order to take into account a \n\npossible excavation downstream, close to the toe of the dam. Scenario b) involves both the \n\ndam/foundation joint and the rock mass joint dipping 25\u00b0 towards upstream, which was \n\npurposely included in the model for stability analysis. This hypothetical situation may \n\nsimulate a combined mode of failure, where the failure path occurs both along the \n\ndam/foundation interface and through intact rock, in geology where the rock is horizontally or \n\nnear horizontally bedded and the intact rock is weak (USACE 1994). In scenario c), sliding \n\nalong the inclined rock mass joint is prevented, assuming that the behaviour of this joint is \n\nelastic. Finally, scenario d) concerns sliding through the dam body, along a construction joint.  \n\nAnalysis was carried out with the method of strength reduction, typically applied in \n\nfoundation design. The model was first run until equilibrium, then the fluid flow analysis was \n\nswitched off and, for each failure scenario, the friction angle of the highlighted discontinuities \n\nwas gradually reduced until failure (the reduction coefficient was applied to tan ?). Each \n\nanalysis started with the same water pressures, which were obtained assuming the reservoir at \n\nthe retention water level. In cases a), b), c) and e), zero cohesion and zero tensile strength \n\nwere assigned to the dam/foundation joint, involved in the failure mode. In case d), zero \n\ncohesion was assigned to a dam construction joint, in order to allow sliding and to simulate \n\nfailure along that discontinuity. In this latter case, additional analysis was carried out, which \n\nconsisted of applying a gradually increasing water pressure along the dam joint, instead of \n\nreducing the joint friction angle. The failure indicator was the horizontal crest displacement. \n\nResults obtained with an initial friction angle of 35\u00b0 were compared with those obtained with \n\nan initial friction angle of 30\u00b0 (friction angles assumed on rock joints, on the dam/foundation \n\njoint and on the dam horizontal joints), in order to assess differences in the results due to \n\nvariations in joint shear strength.  With the exception of case d), analysis was also carried out \n\nassuming no drainage system in the dam foundation. \n\nStability analysis results are shown in Figure 7.28 to Figure 7.30, in which, for ease of \n\nanalysis, friction angles in the x-axis are shown in reverse order. The first of these figures \n\nshows the results of scenarios a), b) and c), which may be compared with one another. In both \n\nscenarios a) and c) stability was assessed for friction angles as low as around 9.5\u00b0, and the \n\ndam/foundation system remained stable (F > 4.2 for ? = 35\u00b0 and F > 3.5 for ? = 30\u00b0).  \n\n\n\n 387 \n\na) b) \n \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   21-Nov-08  10:03\n\n  cycle         0 \n\n  time  =  0.000E+00 sec\n\nblock plot                 \n\n-1.500\n\n-0.500\n\n 0.500\n\n 1.500\n\n 2.500\n\n 3.500\n\n 4.500\n\n 5.500\n\n 6.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\n-1.000  0.000  1.000  2.000  3.000  4.000  5.000  6.000  7.000\n\n(*10^1)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (blocks)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                               \n\n \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   21-Nov-08  10:03\n\n  cycle         0 \n\n  time  =  0.000E+00 sec\n\nblock plot                 \n\n-1.500\n\n-0.500\n\n 0.500\n\n 1.500\n\n 2.500\n\n 3.500\n\n 4.500\n\n 5.500\n\n 6.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\n-1.000  0.000  1.000  2.000  3.000  4.000  5.000  6.000  7.000\n\n(*10^1)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (blocks)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                               \n\nc) d) \n \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   21-Nov-08  10:03\n\n  cycle         0 \n\n  time  =  0.000E+00 sec\n\nblock plot                 \n\n-1.500\n\n-0.500\n\n 0.500\n\n 1.500\n\n 2.500\n\n 3.500\n\n 4.500\n\n 5.500\n\n 6.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\n-1.000  0.000  1.000  2.000  3.000  4.000  5.000  6.000  7.000\n\n(*10^1)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (blocks)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                               \n \n\n \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   21-Nov-08  10:03\n\n  cycle         0 \n\n  time  =  0.000E+00 sec\n\nblock plot                 \n\n-1.500\n\n-0.500\n\n 0.500\n\n 1.500\n\n 2.500\n\n 3.500\n\n 4.500\n\n 5.500\n\n 6.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\n-1.000  0.000  1.000  2.000  3.000  4.000  5.000  6.000  7.000\n\n(*10^1)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (blocks)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                               \n \n\ne)  \n\n \n\n    UDEC (Version 4.00)\n\nLEGEND\n\n   23-Oct-08  16:49\n\n  cycle         0 \n\n  time  =  0.000E+00 sec\n\nblock plot                 \n\n-1.500\n\n-0.500\n\n 0.500\n\n 1.500\n\n 2.500\n\n 3.500\n\n 4.500\n\n 5.500\n\n 6.500\n\n(*10^1)\n\n-1.000  0.000  1.000  2.000  3.000  4.000  5.000  6.000  7.000\n\n(*10^1)\n\nJOB TITLE :  (blocks)                                                                       \n\nLNEC - DBB                    \n\n                               \n\na)  dam/foundation interface \n\nb) dam/foundation interface and rock mass joint \n\ndownstream from the dam dipping 25\u00b0 towards \n\nupstream \n\nc)  dam/foundation interface, preventing slip on the \n\nrock mass joint downstream from the dam \n\ndipping 25\u00b0 towards upstream \n\nd)  dam construction joint \n\ne) dam/foundation  interface,   neglecting  the \n\nresistance of the rock wedge at the toe of the \n\ndam. \n\nFigure 7.27 \u2013 Analysed failure modes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   388 \n\nAlthough stable, displacements in scenario a) are considerably higher when the initial friction \n\nangle is 30\u00b0. Displacements are much lower in scenario c), in which sliding along the inclined \n\nrock mass joint is prevented. Indeed, in this case, it is as if the inclined rock mass joint were \n\nnot there. In scenario a), the presence of this joint can make larger displacements occur. In \n\nscenario b), with the drainage system operating well, the dam is unstable for friction angles \n\nlower than around 15\u00b0 (F = 2.6 for ? = 35\u00b0 and F = 2.1 for ? = 30\u00b0). Without drainage, the \n\ndam is not stable for friction angles lower than 19\u00b0 and 21\u00b0, for the initial angles of 35\u00b0 and \n\n30\u00b0, respectively (F = 2.0 and 1.5). In the cases of no drainage system, water pressures are \n\nhigher and therefore the initial elastic displacement is also higher.  \n\nIn scenario d), whose results are shown in Figure 7.29, sliding along the highlighted dam \n\nconstruction joint only occurs for friction angles lower than around 18\u00b0 (F = 2.1 for ? = 35\u00b0 \n\nand F = 1.8 for ? = 30\u00b0). Water pressures can go up to 0.21 MPa, for a joint friction angle of \n\n35\u00b0, and 0.16 MPa, for a joint friction angle of 30\u00b0. These water pressures are equivalent to 21 \n\nand 16 m of water column, respectively. The joint along which sliding is being analysed is \n\n6 m above the reservoir bottom, therefore, when the reservoir is at crest level, there is a water \n\ncolumn of 27.8 m above the joint, which is higher than the water column that may cause \n\nsliding. \n\nIncreasing the passive wedge resistance is one of the available methods for increasing gravity \n\ndam resistance to sliding, and therefore scenario e), in which this resistance is neglected, is \n\nthe most unfavourable of the four analysed failure modes which involve the dam/foundation \n\ninterface. Analysis was carried out assuming that the drainage system is working properly, \n\nthat the water pressure at the drainage line is 60 % of the reservoir head, as that recorded in \n\nsome cross sections of blocks 6-7 and 7-8 (Figure 4.23), and also assuming that the drains are \n\nall clogged. Stability analysis results for ? = 35\u00b0 (Figure 7.30) show that the dam is unstable \n\nfor friction angles lower than 22.4\u00b0, in the former case (F = 1.7), for friction angles lower than \n\naround 26\u00b0, in the second case (F = 1.4), and is unstable for friction angles lower than 34.5\u00b0 in \n\nfoundations without drainage system (F = 1.02). \n\nIn scenarios a) and c), if failure were to occur, sliding would be along the dam/foundation \n\ninterface. In scenarios d) and e) failure is obviously along the highlighted discontinuities. \n\nScenario b) deserves further analysis in order to understand how the dam/foundation system \n\nfails.

Friction angle in discontinuities close to the dam/foundation \n\ninterface which ensure safety against sliding and for which failure occurs, and corresponding \n\nsafety factors (failure scenarios shown in Figure 7.27). \n\nIn the four failure scenarios analysed, the dam/foundation system is unstable when the \n\nreservoir is at the maximum water level and the drainage system is inoperative, and thus these \n\nsituations are not shown in Figure 7.32 and Figure 7.33. For the same reservoir level, in both \n\nscenarios a) and c) the dam/foundation system remains stable when the drainage system is \n\nworking properly, while in scenario b) failure occurs for a friction angle of around 27.5\u00b0 \n\n(F = 1.4) (Figure 7.32). In scenario e), of which the results are shown in Figure 7.33, the dam \n\nis unstable for friction angles lower than 34.47\u00b0 when the reservoir is at the maximum water \n\nlevel (F = 1.01). \n\nTable 7.12 shows that, of failure scenarios a), b) and c), the results of scenario b) are the ones \n\nwhich can be compared with those obtained using the limit equilibrium analysis. For ease of \n\ncomparison, results presented in Table 7.11 and in Table 7.12 are summarized in Table 7.13.  \n\nFailure mode e) is the only one which enables UDEC analysis to be verified, as the same \n\nresults must be obtained for similar loads with both the UDEC and limit equilibrium analysis. \n\nIndeed, when the reservoir is at the retention water level and the drainage system is operative \n\nalmost the same friction angles were obtained (21.2\u00b0 in the limit equilibrium analysis and \n\nbetween 21.3\u00b0 and 22.39\u00b0 in the UDEC analysis). A difference as low as around 2\u00b0 is \n\n\n\n   394 \n\nobtained in similar conditions, but with the reservoir at the maximum water level (32.4\u00b0 in the \n\nlimit equilibrium analysis and between 34.47\u00b0 and 34.73\u00b0 in the UDEC analysis). However, \n\nwhen the drainage system is inoperative, the friction angles obtained in the UDEC analysis \n\n(34.21\u00b0 - 34.47\u00b0) are higher than that given by the limit equilibrium method (27.8\u00b0). This \n\ndifference can be explained by the higher uplift pressures obtained in the UDEC analysis, \n\nwhen compared with those given by the linear distribution of water pressures between the \n\nreservoir and the tailwater, assumed in the limit equiulibrium analysis. This difference in \n\nwater pressures is shown in Figure 7.34. A limit equilibrium analysis carried out assuming a \n\nresultant of the uplift pressure 24 % higher than that given by the linear distribution of water \n\npressures would lead to the same friction angle at failure as the UDEC analysis (assuming that \n\nin the UDEC model failure occurs for a friction angle of 34.3\u00b0). \n\nIn the analysis in which it is assumed that downstream from the dam the reservoir is at its \n\nactual level, the UDEC results are within the range of friction angles given by the limit \n\nequilibrium method, when only part or full passive force is considered, but are closer to those \n\nobtained for one third passive force. \n\n7.5 Conclusions \n\nThis chapter presents a study on seepage in Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dam foundation using both continuum \n\nand discontinuum models. Information provided from borehole water-inflow tests presented \n\nin chapter 4 was essential to develop both models. Analysis of seepage using the UDEC \n\nmodel, which takes into account the coupled hydromechanical behaviour of rock masses, \n\nshows that results depend mainly on the joint normal stiffness and on joint aperture. Stability \n\nanalysis was carried out with different assumptions about uplift pressures and joint shear \n\nstrength. Results allowed us to quantify the influence of water pressures on the stability of the \n\ndam. This result draws attention to the importance of using recorded water pressures for the \n\nsliding safety assessment of existing dams, as recommended by the European Club of ICOLD \n\n(2004b).  \n\nDiscontinuum models are difficult to apply in most practical cases, because jointing patterns \n\nare very complex and there is usually a lack of data on hydraulic properties of the \n\ndiscontinuity sets. Among these parameters are the orientation and spacing of discontinuities, \n\nand the hydromechanical characterization data, namely joint normal stiffness, joint apertures \n\nand residual aperture, which is not readily available. However, such models which simulate \n\nthe hydromechanical interaction are relevant in stability analysis, and the uncertainty in the \n\ndifferent parameters, can be overcome by performing stability analysis assuming that each \n\nparameter may vary within a credible range. \n\n \n\n\n\n 395 \n\nHu \n\n(m) \n\nHd \n\n(m) \n\nDrainage \n\nsystem \n\nRiver bottom \n\ndownstream \n\nfrom the dam \n\n Friction angle  \n\nLimit \n\nequilibrium \n\nUDEC \n\n failure last stable \n\n84.8 60.0 not operative 1) 27.8\u00b0 34.21\u00b0 34.47\u00b0 \n\n(retention water \n\nlevel) \n\n 2) 11.1\u00b0 - 22.6\u00b0 18.44\u00b0 19.30\u00b0 \n\noperative 1) 21.2\u00b0 21.30\u00b0 22.39\u00b0 \n\n   2) 8.2\u00b0 - 17.1\u00b0 14.04\u00b0 14.54\u00b0 \n\n91.8 67.8 not operative 1) 45.6\u00b0 unstable \n\n(maximum water \n\nlevel) \n\n 2) 27.8\u00b0 - 40.6\u00b0 unstable \n\noperative 1) 32.4\u00b0 34.47\u00b0 34.73\u00b0 \n\n   2) 18.2\u00b0 - 28.1\u00b0 26.57\u00b0 28.31\u00b0 \n\n \n\nDownstream from the dam the river bottom is: 1) at the same level as the concrete/rock mass interface (51.0 m) \n\n2) at its actual level (59.5 m) \n\nTable 7.13 \u2013 Comparison between the UDEC results and those from the limit equilibrium \n\nmethod. \n\n \nDam/foundation interface - domain pressures\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 35.0 40.0 45.0 50.0\n\nDistance from the heel along the base of the dam (m)\n\nD\no\n\nm\na\n\nin\n p\n\nr\ne\nss\n\nu\nr\ne\n (\n\nx\n 1\n\n0\n-1\n\n M\nP\n\na\n)\n\nlinear distribution \n\nof uplift pressures \n\nUDEC domain pressures: \n\n    - reservoir at the retention water level\n\n    - drainage system not operative\n\n    - river bottom downstream from the dam at the\n\n     same level as the concrete/rock mass interface\n\n \n\nFigure 7.34 \u2013 Comparison of water pressures along the dam/foundation joint obtained in the \n\nUDEC analysis with the linear distribution of water pressures. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   396 \n\nThe main limitation of the UDEC fluid flow analysis is that it is carried out in 2D. As flow in \n\nfractured rock masses is mainly three-dimensional, 2D flow modelling can be highly \n\nmisleading because water can not flow in other directions, out of the plane of the model. \n\nHowever, in dam foundations the flow is mainly in the upstream-downstream direction, and \n\ntherefore 2D analysis may be considered adequate in most cases. For arch dams, 3D analysis \n\nis necessary, but coupled fracture flow modelling of an arch dam foundation would imply \n\nrepresenting a network of joints from various sets, which would be computationally \n\nprohibitive. \n\nIn dam stability evaluation, the main advantage of using the 2D code UDEC instead of the \n\nlimit equilibrium method is that it allows the study of a wider range of failure modes. This \n\nwas the case in section 7.4.3.2, in which five different failure modes involving the \n\ndam/foundation interface, rock joints and a dam construction joint were effectively analysed. \n\nIn addition, UDEC enables displacements to be calculated in seismic analysis, in contrast to \n\nwhat happens with the limit equilibrium approach. Stability analysis is also easily done in 3D, \n\nassuming water pressures obtained with equivalent continuum models. In the case of Alqueva \n\ndam, presented in the previous chapter, water pressures calculated with the global hydraulic \n\nmodel could be transferred to the global mechanical model, in which other interface elements \n\ncould be included, so as to evaluate stability. In 3D, discontinuum models are particularly \n\nadequate for scenarios of foundation failure, as limiting equilibrium procedures, like those \n\nproposed by Londe (1973a), make basic assumptions about the forces acting on the \n\nindependent volumes of rock that may become kinematically unstable, and are thus much \n\nsimplified. \n\nAs stated in USACE (2005), advanced analytical analysis, such as that carried out with \n\nUDEC, can be used to gain a better understanding of structural behaviour. It is, however, \n\nhighlighted that the results obtained from such analysis must be used in conjunction with \n\ntraditional analysis methods, and that the advanced analytical methods can be difficult to \n\nperform and evaluate. This type of analysis is particularly useful when the foundation \n\ncontains more than one material or is made up of a combination of intact rock, jointed rock \n\nand sheared rock, as, in these cases, the overall strength of the foundation depends on the \n\nstress-strain characteristics and compatibility of the various materials. It is also relevant in \n\nthose cases in which controls of maximum displacement, needed to ensure proper function \n\nand safety, may prevail over safety factor requirements. \n\n \n\n\n\n 397 \n\n8 Conclusions \n\n8.1 Summary and conclusions \n\nThe main objective of this research was to validate and justify the application of numerical \n\nmodels for the analysis of hydromechanical behaviour of concrete dam foundations in normal \n\noperating conditions. The effective use of these models is necessary to make the analysis of \n\nthe monitoring data and safety control of these structures more efficient. The study explored \n\nthe possibility of using simplified statistical models, traditionally employed in analysis of dam \n\ndisplacements, in the analysis of recorded discharges. A series of in situ tests was carried out \n\nso as to understand the way in which seepage occurs in some areas of the foundation of two \n\nlarge concrete dams. Taking into account test results and hydraulic and geomechanical \n\ncharacterization of the rock mass, different numerical hydraulic and hydromechanical models \n\nwere afterwards developed to simulate both local and global effects. These models were then \n\nvalidated against the flow rates and water pressures recorded in situ.  \n\nThe main scientific contribution of this thesis is not only the validation of hypotheses \n\nassumed in recently developed numerical codes, by comparison of numerical results with both \n\nexperimental and field data, but also the development of methodologies to calibrate models \n\nfor the specific geological and geotechnical conditions of a given dam foundation. This \n\nresearch has made relevant contributions in the following areas:  \n\n- the viability of using simplified statistical methods of quantitative interpretation in the \n\nanalysis and prediction of foundation behaviour; \n\n- the use of in situ tests, particularly borehole water-inflow tests, to complement the \n\nusual monitoring data; \n\n- the development of numerical models adequate for the assessment of concrete dam \n\nfoundations\u2019 hydraulic and hydromechanical behaviour in normal operating \n\nconditions, using available data together with the results of the proposed in situ tests; \n\n- the application of numerical models for both the simulation of borehole water-inflow \n\ntests and the analysis of piezometers\u2019 readings; and \n\n- the assessment of the safety of concrete dams for failure scenarios involving the \n\nfoundation. \n\nRegarding the viability of using simplified statistical methods of quantitative interpretation in \n\nthe analysis and prediction of foundation behaviour, addressed in the third chapter, a study \n\n\n\n   398 \n\nwas carried out to experiment applying methods customarily employed in the analysis of \n\nmechanical factors in the analysis of discharges. In this study, the shape of the influence line \n\nof the hydrostatic pressure on discharges in a concrete dam foundation was first established \n\nwith a numerical model that has the required capabilities for simulating the hydromechanical \n\nprocess. Using polynomial functions of which the graph adequately follows the shape of the \n\nabove-mentioned influence line, a series of quantitative interpretation analysis was carried \n\nout. The most significant conclusions were that the effect that variations in reservoir level \n\nhave on discharges is adequately simulated by polynomials of the type h\n3\n + h or h\n\n4\n + h, and \n\nthat it is not possible to predict discharges recorded in single drains, as they are largely due to \n\nlocal effects and do not represent the permeability of the rock mass. This means that \n\ndischarges recorded in seepage weirs, collected in relatively large areas, rather than \n\ndischarges in single drains should be analysed. The study presented here shows that statistical \n\nmodels based on the simplified methods of quantitative interpretation, which can be an \n\naccurate and powerful tool in the analysis of concrete dam displacements, are not so accurate \n\nwhen used in the analysis of the hydraulic behaviour. Although more limited when used in the \n\nanalysis of discharges, this type of method may be useful to approximately predict discharges \n\nin short periods of time. \n\nBorehole water-inflow tests, carried out in drains and piezometric boreholes, are introduced as \n\nan innovative means of obtaining more detailed information on the hydraulic activity in dam \n\nfoundations. These tests, which are conducted with single and double packers, allow \n\nmeasurement of discharges and water pressures in isolated sections of the holes. Analysis of \n\ntest results in conjunction with other available information, such as geological and \n\ngeotechnical data of the dam site, boreholes logs and results of other complementary tests, can \n\nbe extremely significant in increasing knowledge of the hydraulic behaviour of concrete dam \n\nfoundations. The information provided by these tests can be used not only to validate \n\nhydraulic models and to improve numerical models that take into account the existence of \n\nrock mass discontinuities, but also to choose the best place to locate piezometric chambers or \n\nto choose suitable remedial or supplementary seepage control measures in areas of the \n\nfoundation where the discharges and/or the uplift pressures are excessive. \n\nBorehole water-inflow test procedures were established in this thesis, and are presented as a \n\nbasis for other studies. These test procedures were progressively improved during the weeks \n\nin which tests were carried out in the foundations of two large Portuguese concrete dams and \n\nproved to be practical and effective. Analysis of water-inflow test results together with data \n\nrecorded with water electrical conductivity analysis and, in some cases, with additional simple \n\ntests that include closure and opening of boreholes within a given area of the dam foundation, \n\nproved to be appropriate to obtain knowledge of seepage patterns underneath concrete dams.  \n\n\n\n 399 \n\nThe tests carried out in both Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o and Alqueva dam led to some conclusions about the \n\ndepth at which the seepage paths cross each one of the tested boreholes, about the distribution \n\nof discharges and water pressures along the boreholes, and about seepage paths linking \n\nvarious boreholes. Results analysis showed that tests are better carried out with both single \n\nand double packers, as the two sets of results provide different and additional information. \n\nThe simultaneous analysis of water pressures and discharges at each test interval can give \n\ninformation about the aperture of the discontinuities through which water flows. The \n\nknowledge obtained from the use of borehole water-inflow tests and water electrical \n\nconductivity analysis is relevant when identifying possible failure modes, and can thus help in \n\nthe development of a suitable monitoring programme, which indirectly contributes to a better \n\nsafety assessment of the dam. \n\nConcerning modelling, different approaches were used to simulate both local and global \n\neffects and to assess the stability of dam foundations. Modelling was carried out using a step-\n\nby-step procedure, starting from simple models and gradually adding complexity, in order not \n\nonly to detect possible errors in parameters, loads or boundary conditions, but also to make it \n\nclear how each change in the model affected the numerical outcome. Equivalent continuum \n\nmodels with regions of different permeability were employed to analyse both local and global \n\neffects, as an alternative to discontinuum modelling. Fracture flow models were used in the \n\ncase of the gravity dam, for which the stability for different foundation failure scenarios was \n\nalso evaluated. \n\nAppropriate ways to represent individual drains were analysed in detail, taking into account \n\nthe computational difficulties of three-dimensional models. In fact, while the drain\u2019s \n\ncylindrical surface is easily represented in simple 2D meshes, this is not the case in large 3D \n\nmodels. The alternative, employed in this study, is to represent the drain as a line, i.e. by its \n\naxis, however in such cases the mesh around the drain must be carefully selected. Comparison \n\nof different mesh sizes in this study showed that finer meshes do not improve the numerical \n\nsolution, but tend to amplify the line singularity. Modelling the drain by its axis allows the use \n\nof coarser meshes which, consequently, leads to shorter run times. Particularly relevant is the \n\nconclusion that, with the type of elements used in both codes FLAC and 3DEC, when the \n\ndrain is modelled by its axis the optimal size of the elements in the vicinity of the drain is in \n\nthe order of three and a half times the borehole diameter. \n\nIn this study, borehole water-inflow tests carried out in situ were simulated using a detailed \n\nthree-dimensional model which allowed each drain to be modelled individually, taking into \n\naccount the results of rock mass permeability tests and identified areas where seepage paths \n\ncross each borehole. This detailed 3D model required a fine mesh, and thus, with a view to \n\nusing adequate element sizes and faster analysis, numerical experiments with different meshes \n\nwere carried out, from very fine meshes to coarser meshes. Back-analysis techniques are \n\n\n\n   400 \n\nsometimes used to determine unknown or little-known physical parameters; however, in this \n\ncase, even with the low number of parameters considered in each model, this would have \n\npresented significant difficulties, namely due to the excessive run-times required. Therefore, \n\nduring the model\u2019s development, a trial-and-error estimating procedure was carried out to \n\ncontinually adjust parameters. \n\nThe borehole water-inflow tests provided more details about seepage in the foundation of both \n\nAlqueva and Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o dams. The simulations of borehole water-inflow tests presented in \n\nchapter 6 provided a good match of recorded discharges and water pressures for different \n\nexperimental conditions. These simulations are relevant as the numerical modelling of tests \n\nprovides a valuable tool for the validation of numerical techniques. Parametric studies carried \n\nout showed the importance of assigning proper values to both rock mass equivalent \n\npermeability and the permeability of the layers which simulate the main flow paths. The \n\nknowledge of seepage patterns around particular boreholes gained from test analysis was \n\nessential to develop an effective application of a simplified global model of the dam \n\nfoundation. \n\nThe difficulties in simulating tests carried out in one of the boreholes draw attention to two \n\nrelevant issues, both concerning numerical modelling. The first is the fact that numerical \n\nresults can be highly sensitive to boundary conditions, and therefore great care must be taken \n\nin order to use the most appropriate boundary conditions for the problem to be solved. In fact, \n\nit was impossible to simulate results of tests carried out in one of the dam drains until the \n\nexistence of a small leakage through the floor of a gallery located downstream from where the \n\ntests were carried out was taken into account. This leakage was almost imperceptible, and \n\nonly detectable by personnel with great experience in the task of dam inspection. This fact \n\nleads to the second relevant issue, that those involved in numerical modelling of test results \n\nshould follow up the tests carried out. This may not be so relevant in tests carried out in the \n\nlaboratory, of which the procedures are well established. However, in tests carried out in situ, \n\nevery detail can be relevant for accurate numerical modelling. Even details concerning the \n\nequipment and the way tests were carried out can help and be significant in numerical \n\nmodelling of test results. This also applies to the numerical modelling of dam behaviour, \n\nwhich means that the modeller always profits from visiting the dam site and carefully \n\nobserving relevant aspects. This greatly helps in choosing appropriate boundary conditions \n\nand in deciding the relevant aspects to be taken into account and included in the model. \n\nGlobal 3D foundation models involve large volumes of the rock masses, thus can only be \n\ncarried out with coarse meshes, in which it is not possible to model each one of the drains. As \n\na consequence the drainage system is represented in a simplified way. The study presented \n\nhere shows that modelling the drainage system by a hypothetical continuous trench with the \n\nsame depth as the drains is practical. In this case, if the average value of the hydraulic head at \n\n\n\n 401 \n\nthe line of the drains is assumed, the total discharge at the trench is almost the same as the \n\ntotal discharge in a 3D model, and the difference in piezometric heads is only significant close \n\nto the line of the drains. Global models may not be able to simulate local effects but can \n\nprovide mean water pressures and flow rates for each dam foundation block, which is \n\nsignificant in stability analysis.  \n\nThe interdependency between the state of stress and seepage in the foundation of Alqueva \n\ndam was studied in an uncoupled way, taking into account the results of global hydraulic and \n\nmechanical models, which were both validated against monitoring data. A methodology was \n\ndeveloped that can be used to establish rules which, from a hydraulic model calibrated for \n\nspecific water levels in the reservoir and downstream from the dam, allow the calculation of \n\ndischarges for different water levels, taking into account that permeability depends not only \n\non the stress level but also on local geological features. The simplicity of the method makes it \n\nvery useful in the safety assessment of concrete dams.  \n\nSeveral conclusions are drawn regarding the suitability and limitations of the adopted \n\nnumerical models. Concerning the study of both local and global hydraulic behaviour of dam \n\nfoundations, it is concluded that although discontinuum models provide a more natural \n\nrepresentation of flow in jointed rock masses, equivalent continuum models can also be used \n\nsuccessfully. In fact, realistic and efficient models were developed with only a few \n\nparameters, all of them with physical meaning. These simpler models were employed as an \n\nalternative to discontinuum modelling and proved to be an effective analysis tool to assess \n\nconcrete dam foundations\u2019 behaviour in normal operating conditions. These models have the \n\nadvantage of making it possible to avoid the difficulties of characterizing the behaviour of \n\nindividual joints and the complications of explicitly representing the discontinuities in large \n\nmodels of dam foundations. Hydraulic equivalent continuum models require the permeability \n\nof the different foundation areas to be properly measured and the main seepage paths to be \n\nclearly identified. In these models, flow through specific higher conductivity features may be \n\napproximated, as in this study, with bands of elements of higher permeability. Due to \n\nuncertainty about geomechanical and hydraulic properties, it is essential to assess the key \n\nparameters. \n\nRegarding monitoring of the dam foundation, the in situ tests used in this study (borehole \n\nwater-inflow tests, water electrical conductivity analysis and simple tests that involve the \n\nclosing and opening of drainage and piezometric boreholes) could in future be used in other \n\ndams as a supplement to the usual seepage information available from drains and piezometers, \n\nas they allow the assessment of seepage patterns underneath the dam. The numerical study on \n\npiezometric measurements presented in the last part of chapter 6 highlights the significance of \n\nusing small intake areas to measure uplift pressures or pressures within discontinuities. The \n\nmost appropriate solution for piezometric measurements depends highly on local conditions \n\n\n\n   402 \n\nand therefore the positioning and length of the piezometric chambers must be decided case by \n\ncase, in order to provide the most accurate information. This can be easily done in the \n\nmajority of the Portuguese concrete dams.  \n\nFor those whose work involves the modelling of concrete dams, especially arch dams, the \n\ncode 3DEC is particularly suitable to carry out stability analysis, considering some \n\ndiscontinuities in the foundation. In this case, failure mechanisms involve the rock mass \n\ndiscontinuities and the dam/foundation interface. 3DEC allows the study of the dam-\n\nfoundation system, as it allows the modelling of the dam as a shell structure, represented by \n\nthe FEM, and the foundation as a group of blocks. Hydraulic analysis with the code 3DEC \n\npresented in this thesis was carried out with a new version of the numerical code, which \n\nallows both equivalent continuum and fracture flow models. The validation of the equivalent \n\ncontinuum possibility of this new version, by comparing its results with analytical solutions, \n\nis relevant as it is very useful to study the hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation with the \n\nsame code which is used to carry out stability analysis. In mechanical modelling, the \n\nconsideration of a few selected discontinuities is often sufficient to assess the safety \n\nconditions. Fluid flow analysis of global 3D foundation models based on equivalent \n\ncontinuum concepts, like those presented in this thesis, may provide an adequate \n\napproximation of the water pressures on the discontinuities, necessary for the mechanical \n\nstability analysis.  \n\nIn order to improve current ability to assess the safety of concrete dams for failure scenarios \n\ninvolving the foundation, a detailed study on seepage in a gravity dam foundation was carried \n\nout, using a discontinuum model. While the evaluation of dam behaviour can be done \n\naccurately with equivalent continuum models, dam stability analysis is better carried out with \n\nmodels in which the discontinuities are explicitly represented. The results of these models, \n\nhowever, depend mainly on the fracture pattern and on hydromechanical characterization \n\ndata, namely joint normal stiffness, joint apertures and residual aperture. Therefore, stability \n\nanalysis must be carried out assuming that each parameter may vary within a credible range. \n\nThe study presented in Chapter 7 uses the code UDEC, which allows the hydromechanical \n\nbehaviour of jointed rock masses to be accurately simulated. Stability analysis was carried out \n\nwith different assumptions about uplift pressures, joint shear strength and joint hydraulic \n\nproperties. Results allowed us to quantify the influence of water pressures on the stability of \n\nthe dam. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 403 \n\n8.2 Further developments \n\nConcerning the observation and analysis of dam foundation behaviour, additional studies can \n\nbe done, namely quantitative interpretations carried out for different periods of time, \n\ngradually longer, but using the same functions to represent the two main effects, which could \n\nbe a way of quantifying phenomena such as clogging of the rock mass, and more detailed \n\nanalysis of the results obtained in quantitative interpretations of discharges collected in \n\nmeasuring weirs, taking into account that for different reservoir levels the water may be \n\ncollected from a different number of drains. Another area for further investigation concerns \n\nthe hypothesis regarding the fact that in both Alto Lindoso and Alqueva dams, for a given \n\nwater level, the highest discharges are recorded when that level is reached for the first time. \n\nThe suggestion made in this study is that this could be due to the higher rate of variation of \n\nthe reservoir level. \n\nFurther developments in the experimental field include the simplification of test procedures \n\nand the implementation of an automatic data collection system. Test procedures could be \n\nsimplified, depending on the information required, by taking readings in transient conditions. \n\nThis may significantly decrease the time taken to carry out tests in a large number of cases. \n\nMore detailed and accurate information on variations in water pressures during tests could be \n\neasily obtained via a data logger linked to a laptop. As a basis for other studies, it would be \n\nvery interesting to have multilevel piezometers or piezodrains continuously monitored by \n\nautomatic recording systems. This would provide valuable data, which analysed in \n\nconjunction with records of variations in both reservoir level and ambient temperature, could \n\nprovide important information about hydromechanical interaction in some areas of a concrete \n\ndam foundation.  \n\nRegarding numerical modelling, the procedures presented for analysis of observed behaviour \n\nby means of global continuum models may be developed in order to represent the \n\nhydromechanical interaction more consistently. To carry out hydromechanical analysis, an \n\niterative procedure may be implemented, as the developed hydraulic and mechanical models \n\nare essentially the same. It is therefore possible to transfer the uplift and seepage forces \n\nobtained from the seepage flow analysis to the mechanical analysis. Firstly, the hydraulic \n\nproblem can be solved using initial hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions, which \n\nprovide the seepage and uplift forces. Secondly, the mechanical model may be run and the \n\nfinal states of stress and strain allow the new permeability coefficients to be calculated. The \n\niterative procedure ends when the difference in displacements and hydraulic heads in \n\nsuccessive iterations is not significant. As was shown in the case studied, this coupled \n\nanalysis may require different laws to be attributed to the foundation of each dam block. The \n\nmeshes of the hydraulic and mechanical models may not be exactly the same. This is the case \n\nof the global hydraulic and mechanical models presented in chapter 6, developed for Alqueva \n\n\n\n   404 \n\ndam. It is therefore necessary to develop a procedure to interpolate the different variables \n\nwhich have to be transferred from one model to another.  \n\nIn this study, stability analysis was carried out only for gravity dams, however these \n\nprocedures can be extended to 3D, for analysis of arch dam foundations or even gravity dams \n\nwith more complex jointing patterns. These more elaborate models will require better \n\ncharacterization of both fracture geometry and hydraulic properties. In addition, they will also \n\nrequire the application of adequate methodologies and the use of 3D joint generators, \n\nparticularly discrete fracture network (DFN) generators, in order to realistically reproduce \n\nstatistical descriptions of joint patterns. DFN generators for flow simulations in fractured hard \n\nrocks, which only represent the void space of the connected fractures and exclude the rock \n\nblocks between the fractures, are practical and have been applied in different engineering \n\nfields. Their use in 3D in the particular case of dam foundations could be a basis for further \n\nstudy. \n\nAnalysis in steady state conditions, such as that presented in this study, is adequate in most \n\nfluid flow analysis of dam foundations. However, there are circumstances in which the time \n\ndependent effect transient flow may be important. This was the case in chapter 3, in wich it \n\nwas found useful to determine flow times. However, the small timesteps required by UDEC \n\nmake transient fluid flow analysis impractical in relatively large domains and with very small \n\njoint apertures, such as those necessary to analyse flow in dam foundations. It is therefore \n\nnecessary to develop new procedures, based on algorithms that use larger timesteps. \n\nAnother field that merits further attention is concerned with the foundation treatment, namely \n\nregarding characterization, for more accurate modelling. In this study, grouted rock mass \n\nareas were simulated by regions of lower permeability, of which the width in the upstream-\n\ndownstream direction was roughly estimated. According to the Committee on Fracture \n\nCharacterization and Fluid Flow (1996), limited analytical prediction is possible and much of \n\nthe grouting procedure is based on experience and on careful application of the \n\nadaptable/observational approach. In this regard, in situ permeability tests are usually carried \n\nout during foundation treatment, before deciding on further grouting, and this gives an \n\nindication of the permeability of the grouted area. In situ tests, such as those based on \n\ngeophysical methods, for example, may be used to map the spreading of grout in dam \n\nfoundations, for better characterization. Regarding modelling, further analysis of grout flow \n\nand solidification could be carried out. \n\n \n\n\n\n 405 \n\nReferences \n\nAlonso, E. 2005.

Measure water level in the reservoir. \n\n2. Measure flow rates (l/min) and water pressures (bar), not only in the borehole which is going \n\nto be tested but also in the drainage and piezometric boreholes located in an area larger than \n\nthat expected to be the borehole\u2019s area of influence (\u201creference values\u201d). If there is no water \n\nflowing out of any of these boreholes, measure, with a depth measure with an electric contact \n\nmeter, the static water level. \n\n3. Insert a piece of metal with the same diameter as the equipment (blind device) into the \n\nborehole. Measure the borehole\u2019s length. If any obstruction which can not be removed is \n\nfound tests are not carried out in that borehole and are restarted in another borehole where \n\ntests are planned to be carried out. \n\n4. Assemble the packer as a  single packer. \n\n5. Place the single packer, with the aid of the pipes and held by the steel cable, for the test \n\ninterval to be defined between the packer and the bottom of the borehole, with minimum and \n\nmaximum lengths of 1 m and 3 m. The \u201cblind device\u201d is not the same length as the packer; \n\ntherefore, even if it is inserted into the borehole without finding any obstruction, it still \n\nmay not be possible to insert the packer, if the borehole has not been drilled straight. If \n\nany difficulty is found whilst inserting the packer, it should not be forced through, tests \n\nare not carried out in that borehole, and the process is restarted in any other borehole where \n\ntests are planned to be carried out. \n\n6. Prepare the water pump: i) remove the air from the hydraulic circuit that links the pump to the \n\npressure valve; ii) link the hose to the water pump; iii) remove the air from the hose; iv) link \n\nthe water hose to the packer. Link the outflow to the air pump hose (in which the \u201cdeflation \n\nsystem\u201d is inserted) to the air pump. \n\n7. Inflate the packer, to seal off the test interval. \n\n8. Measure the following, in pre-defined time intervals  so as to observe the development until \n\nsteady-state conditions are achieved: \n\na. Flow of water into the test interval, if water reaches the pipes\u2019 head. \n\n\n\n   432 \n\nb. The static water level inside the pipes, if water does not reach the pipes\u2019 head.  \n\nc. Water pressure in the test interval, if the packer is equipped with a pressure transducer \n\nin the test interval (a pressure gauge should be installed at the pipes\u2019 head, to check \n\nthe water pressure recorded by the transducer: the water pressure at the transducer \n\nmust correspond to the water pressure recorded at the pressure gauge plus the weight \n\nof a water column with a height equal to the distance between the manometer and the \n\npressure transducer). \n\nd. Quantity of water flowing at above the packer (while tests are being carried out this \n\nborehole\u2019s area works as a drain). If water flowing at above the packer does not reach \n\nthe borehole\u2019s head, use a depth measure with an electric transducer to measure the \n\ndepth of the static water level. \n\nMeasure, after stabilization of the previous values:  \n\na. Discharges in all the drains located in the vicinity of the borehole being tested (water \n\npressure and discharges, in the case of piezodrains). If water does not reach any \n\nborehole\u2019s head, use a depth measure with an electric contact meter to measure the \n\ndepth of the static water level. \n\nb. Water pressure in piezometers installed in the vicinity of the borehole being tested. \n\nc. Taking into account recorded values try to establish the borehole\u2019s area of influence. \n\nIf values have not stabilized after 15 minutes repeat the same measurements every 15 minutes. If after \n\nan hour values are not stabilized, this test phase ends. If water does not reach the pipes\u2019 head test \n\ncontinues from step 11. \n\n9. Close the test interval, not allowing water to flow out of the pipes. \n\n10. Measure the following, in pre-defined time intervals so as to observe the development until \n\nsteady-state conditions are achieved: \n\na. Test interval water pressure. \n\nb. Discharge flowing at above the packer. \n\nThen measure, after values have stabilized:  \n\n\n\n 433 \n\na. Water pressure recorded in piezometers located in the area of influence of the \n\nborehole being tested. \n\nb. Water pressures and discharges in piezodrains located in the area of influence of the \n\nborehole being tested. \n\nIf values have not stabilized after 15 minutes repeat the same measurements every 15 minutes. If after \n\nan hour values are not stabilized, this test phase ends. \n\n11. Deflate the packer, allowing a sufficient time interval so that the packer diameter returns to its \n\ninitial value. \n\n12. Take measurements again in the equipment installed in the area of influence of the borehole \n\nbeing tested (to check if reference values are achieved). \n\n13. Raise the single packer 3 m (so that the same test intervals are considered both with the single \n\nand the double packer). Measure the water pressure at the recording device before inflating the \n\npacker. \n\n14. Repeat steps 7 to 13 until the upper packer reaches the borehole\u2019s head. \n\n15. Remove the equipment from the borehole. \n\n16. With the single packer outside the borehole and when steady-state conditions have been \n\nachieved, measure discharges and water pressures in all the equipment installed in the area of \n\ninfluence of the borehole being tested. \n\n17. Assemble the packer as a double packer with a 3 m long test interval. \n\n18. Place the double packer, with the aid of the pipes and held by the steel cable, to define the test \n\ninterval at 3 m above the first test interval defined with the single packer. Neither the \u201cblind \n\ndevice\u201d nor the single packer used in the previous steps was the same length as the \n\ndouble packer, therefore, even if  it was possible to insert the blind device into the \n\nborehole and carry out tests with the single packer without finding any obstruction, it \n\nmay be not possible to insert the double packer. If any difficulty is found whilst inserting \n\nthe packer, it should not be forced through, tests are not carried out in that borehole, and \n\nthe process is restarted in any other borehole where tests are planned to be carried out. \n\n19. Repeat steps 6 to 15. \n\n\n\n   434 \n\n20. Remove the double packer from the borehole. \n\n21. When tests are concluded, with the double packer out of the borehole and when steady state \n\nconditions have been achieved, measure flow rates and water pressures in all the equipment \n\ninstalled in the area of influence of the borehole being tested. \n\nWhile tests are being carried out, the time at which measurements are taken should be \n\nregistered. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 435 \n\nA1.4 Measurements taken while carrying out borehole water-inflow tests in \n\nboth Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o and Alqueva dams \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   436 \n\n \n\n\n\n                  \n          \n\n \n\nPZ5 M D 14 D 15 D 16 D 17 D 18 D 19 D 20 PZ5 M - E D 21 D 22 D 23 D 1 D 2 D 3 \n\ndischarge    (l/min) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTest step \n\n \n\nTime \nwhen \n\nreadings \nbegan \n\n \n\nwater \npressure \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\ntotal Test \ninterval \n\nAbove \ntest \n\ninterval \n\nwater \npressure \nat pipes \n\nhead \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\nwater \npressure \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\nwater \npressure \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\nwater \npressure \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\nwater \npressure \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\nwater \npress. \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\nwater \npressu. \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\nwater \npressu. \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\nwater \npressu. \n\n(bar) \n\n \n\ndischar\nge \n\n(l/min) \n\n \n\nwater \npressu. \n\n(bar) \n\nTotal \ndischar\n\nge \n\n \n\n \n\n(l/min) \n\n0.
