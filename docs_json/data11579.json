Esta teoria tem descrito alguns fen\u00f3menos at\u00f3micos, at\u00e9 agora apenas explicados \n\npela Mec\u00e2nica Qu\u00e2ntica. A SED sugere que as energias dos n\u00edveis at\u00f3micos s\u00e3o pr\u00e9-\n\ndeterminadas pelo campo de ponto zero (ZPF). Assim, uma vez que as cavidades de \n\nCasimir suprimem alguns dos modos do ZPF, os \u00e1tomos dentro dessas cavidades poder\u00e3o \n\nsofrer desvios energ\u00e9ticos quer no estado fundamental quer no excitado. Desse modo, a \n\ncomuta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1tomos entre o espa\u00e7o livre e cavidades de Casimir poder\u00e1 levar \u00e0 emiss\u00e3o \n\nde radia\u00e7\u00e3o ou a um ganho em energia nas suas propriedades radiativas. Este excesso de \n\nenergia \u00e9 fornecido pelo ZPF, que \u00e1 sa\u00edda da cavidade devolve aos \u00e1tomos o desvio \n\ninicialmente sofrido conferindo-lhes as orbitas caracter\u00edsticas do espa\u00e7o livre. Com base \n\nnesta hip\u00f3tese, come\u00e7amos a nossa investiga\u00e7\u00e3o estudando computacionalmente a \n\nintera\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00e1tomo de Hidrog\u00e9nico cl\u00e1ssico com ZPF, caracteristico do espa\u00e7o livre e de \n\numa cavidade de Casimir. Para isso, integramos numericamente o movimento do eletr\u00e3o \n\nna sua orbita utilizando um modelo em duas dimens\u00f5es j\u00e1 documentado, e desenvolvemos \n\nn\u00f3s pr\u00f3prios um modelo em tr\u00eas dimens\u00f5es. Estimamos tamb\u00e9m, o desvio do estado \n\nfundamental do \u00e1tomo de Hidrog\u00e9nio dentro de uma cavidade de Casimir, fazendo para \n\nisso uma aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o ao oscilador harm\u00f3nico. Feitos estes estudos te\u00f3ricos e \n\ncomputacionais, propusemos um m\u00e9todo experimental para medir o desvio energ\u00e9tico \n\nnos n\u00edveis at\u00f3micos de \u00e1tomos ao passarem por cavidades de Casimir. Projetamos e \n\nmontamos um sistema experimental que permitiu passar gases atrav\u00e9s de cavidades de \n\nCasimir constitu\u00eddas por membranas nano-porosas evaporadas com alum\u00ednio. O sistema, \n\nfeito de a\u00e7o-inox, foi conectado a dois monocromadores que nos permitiram irradiar o \n\ng\u00e1s com uma frequ\u00eancia espec\u00edfica, e tamb\u00e9m, usando um PMT, fazer uma an\u00e1lise \n\nespectroscopia da radia\u00e7\u00e3o emitida. De seguida, fizemos uma an\u00e1lise espectrosc\u00f3pica de \n\n150 a 550 nm, registando a radia\u00e7\u00e3o emitida por \u00e1tomos de Xe ao passarem por \n\nmembranas nano-porosas, onde algumas evid\u00eancias de radia\u00e7\u00e3o foram observadas, no \n\nentanto, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio um estudo mais cuidadoso no futuro. Por ultimo, tamb\u00e9m testamos \n\nalgumas hip\u00f3teses alternativas, excitando previamente os \u00e1tomos de Xe, no entanto, n\u00e3o \n\nfomos capazes de distinguir qualquer radia\u00e7\u00e3o imitida do ruido de fundo. Conclu\u00edmos \n\nainda que o sistema n\u00e3o \u00e9 suficientemente sens\u00edvel nos comprimentos de onda desejados, \n\nmaioritariamente devido ao PMT usado. Finalmente, conclu\u00edmos o nosso trabalho \n\nsugerindo algumas melhorias. \n\n\n\nii \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nStochastic Electrodynamics (SED) is a modern version of classic electrodynamics whose \n\nprincipal innovation is the inclusion of a random electromagnetic zero-point field \n\nbackground. This theory has described some atomic effects, until now only explained by \n\nquantum mechanics. The SED suggests that the atomic level energies are predetermined \n\nby the zero-point field (ZPF). Since a Casimir cavity suppresses some ZPF modes, the \n\natoms inside such cavity could undergo level shifts in their ground and exited states. \n\nSwitching ground or excited atoms between Casimir cavities and the free space can lead \n\nto the hypothetical detection of radiation or an energetic gain in their radiative properties. \n\nThis excess of energy comes from the ZPF which returns the shifted energy of the atomic \n\norbits to the initial values when the atoms return to the free space. Based on this \n\nhypothesis, we start our investigation by studding the classic hydrogen atom interaction \n\nwith the free space and with the ZPF cavity by computational means. We numerically \n\nintegrate the electron motion in its orbit using an already documented two-dimensional \n\nmodel and developed ourselves a three-dimensional model. We also estimate the shift in \n\nthe ground state of the hydrogen atom inside a Casimir cavity, approximating it to the \n\nharmonic oscillator. After this theoretical and computational evaluation, we propose an \n\nexperimental method to measure the energy shift in the atomic levels of an atom of gas \n\nwhen flowing through a Casimir cavity. We projected and mounted an experimental \n\napparatus which allows passing gases through Casimir cavities constituted by nano-\n\nporous metal coated membranes. The system, made of stainless steel, was connected to \n\ntwo monochromators which allow irradiating the gas with a specific wavelength and \n\nmaking a spectroscopic analysis of the emitted radiation using a Photomultiplier tube. We \n\nperformed a spectroscopic analysis for wavelengths ranging from 150 to 550 nm, \n\nrecording the radiation emitted by Xe atoms passing through nano-porous membranes, \n\nwhere some radiation evidences were observed, however a more careful study is required \n\nin the future. We also tested some alternative hypothesis, exciting the Xenon atoms, but \n\nwe could not distinguish the expected radiation emitted from the background noise. We \n\nconclude that the system is not sensitive in the required wavelength, mostly due to the \n\nPMT used. Finally, we conclude our work suggesting some improvements. \n\n\n\niii \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nTo my supervisor, Dr. Fernando Amaro, who was the responsible for the \n\nconcretisation of this work.

Introduction \n\nIn the XVII century it was believed that if we extract all the solid material and gases \n\ncontained in a volume we would have a completely empty space, the vacuum. Over time \n\nthe vacuum concept changed and, in the XIX century, it was noticed that the thermic \n\nradiation would persist. So the vacuum concept got one more requisite, zero temperature, \n\nand then the problem was solved. However, in the XX century it was proven theoretical \n\nand experimentally that even at zero Kelvin there was still energy. For that reason this \n\nenergy was named Zero-Point Energy (ZPE). ZPE takes the form of field fluctuations, \n\nknown Zero-Point Field1 (ZPF) and could be considered the ground state of the vacuum. \n\nNikola Tesla was likely the first to propose the existence of such kind of energy and the \n\npossibility of its use for industrial purposes [1]. After in the end of the XIX century this \n\nproposal could seem to be inconsistent, nowadays more and more researches are looking \n\ninto this possibility.  \n\nAt the realm of Quantum Mechanics (QM), the ZPF existence is often attributed to \n\nthe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. According to this principle, if we are interested in \n\nthe measurement of any two conjugate observables (such as the position and the \n\nmomentum), A and B, they must obey to the commutation relation [?, ?] = ?? (where ? \n\nis the reduced Planck\u2019s constant). Being ?? and ?? respectively the A and B observable \n\nvariances, their uncertainty relation will be ???? ? ?/2. If we measure A with high \n\nprecision then the measurement of B will be less precise. Thereby there cannot be a state \n\nin which the system sits motionless at the bottom of its potential well, for which its \n\nposition and momentum would both be determined with great precision. Hence the \n\nground state of a system must have a distribution in position and momentum satisfying \n\nthe uncertainty principle (???? ? ?/2). This implies that the system must have energy \n\ngreater than the minimum of the potential well, being this ground state energy the ZPE \n\n[2]. \n\nIn addition to these theoretical predictions of the existence of the ZPF, some \n\nexperimental evidences, such as the spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, and the \n\nCasimir forces, seem also to be a consequence of the ZPF [3]. For example, the Casimir \n\n                                                 \n1 The term ZPF is related to all the field fluctuations, even with forces other than the electromagnetic. \n\nHowever in this document whenever we refer to the ZPF we are only considering the electromagnetic \n\nZPF since we only deal with electromagnetic forces. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nforce, which was studied in detail in the last years [4], is often related with the perturbation \n\ninduced in the ZPF by two conductive parallel plates. According to such scenario, some \n\nmodes of the ZPF\u2019s electromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed by the boundary \n\nconditions imposed by the plates, inducing an attractive force between them, due to the \n\ndifference between the outer and inner electromagnetic pressures. The possibility of \n\nextracting energy and heat from the ZPF by means of the Casimir force was theoretically \n\ndemonstrated, without the violation of any thermodynamic law [5]. However, a \n\nsymmetric attractive force between two objects cannot be used to continually extract ZPF \n\nenergy since the same amount of energy is needed to separate again the objects. For now \n\nit is pure speculation the existence of a functional method to use this energy in a recycling \n\ncycle. \n\nEarly in the last century, personalities such as Einstein and Planck made efforts to \n\nstudy the interaction between the electromagnetic oscillator and the radiation. However, \n\nover the years the attentions were diverted to QM. Still, in the second half of the XX \n\ncentury, the classical treatment was reviewed, at this time including a missing key point \n\nin the previous formulations: the existence of a random electromagnetic background \n\nidentical to MQ\u2019s ZPF. This original classical theory is known by Stochastic \n\nElectrodynamics (SED) and has solved some atomic problems such as the orbital \n\ninstability, the particle motion at zero temperature, the Casimir and van der Waals forces, \n\namong others [6]. While for QM the ZPF is a derived result, for SED it is a direct \n\nconsequence of a fundamental assumption. Thus, and mathematically speaking, SED is \n\nnothing more than the use of the relativistic version of the motion classic laws (Newton \n\nsecond law) with an electromagnetic random background described by Maxwell\u2019s \n\nequations.  \n\nFrom the point of view of SED, the electron in a classic orbit around the nucleus \n\nradiates (Larmor radiation) constantly, consequence of its self-reaction. However it also \n\nabsorbs power from the ZPF, being therefore possible that the atom has a stable averaged-\n\norbit. In other words, it is the spectral ZPF\u2019s form which determines the ground state \n\nenergy of the atomic systems (and possibly determines also the energy levels of the \n\nexcited states too) [7]. Hence, it is reasonable to think that, if we somewhat change the \n\nZPF (for example suppressing some resonant modes using a Casimir cavity2), the atoms \n\nwill undergo a level shift. This is the main idea studied in our work. Based on these level \n\n                                                 \n2 A Casimir cavity is in this document understood as a region in space where the ZPF is modified often by \n\nthe presence of some kind of conductive boundary, which suppress some ZPF\u2019s modes. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nshifts, it could be possible to use a method to extract energy from the ZPF in a continuous \n\ncycle, as already proposed in other documents [2] [8].  In this work, we propose a more \n\nelaborated concept, exploring also the shifts in excited states and their related atomic \n\ntransitions.  \n\nUntil now, the reader could still have a fundamental question: \u201cIf there is a ZPF, why \n\ndon\u2019t we detect this radiation?\u201d The answer is simple: if this background is homogeneous, \n\nisotropic and is everywhere, even inside our measuring devices, they can\u2019t distinguish \n\nthis radiation from some internal reference.  For example, according to SED all the atoms \n\nare constantly radiating Larmor radiation, however we don\u2019t detect this radiation because \n\nall the atoms are also absorbing the same radiation and no net energy transference exists \n\nacross a surface [6]. \n\nSED being more intuitive for our purposes than Quantum Electrodynamics3 (QED), \n\nit will be our theoretical basis. Since it is a very immature theory, we were forced to \n\nattempt making some theoretical predictions related with our experimental method by \n\nmeans of computational simulation. However, some effects explored in this work can be \n\nseen from a QM point of view, usually related to the well-known Casimir-Polder/van der \n\nWaals forces (these ones were also successfully explained in the SED framework [9][10]). \n\nFor a deeper study of this subject, the reader can use the following references: for \n\ntheoretical and computational studies about atom-surface interaction potential see \n\n[11][12][13][14][15][16][17]; for experimental Casimir-Polder/van der Waals forces, \n\nmeasurements and detection of modifications in radiative properties induced by boundary \n\nconditions, see [18][19][20][21][22][23][24]; and for some reviews about the Casimir-\n\nPolder/van der Waals theory and experiments see [25][26][4].  \n\nIn the present work, after making a brief review of the literature, we were able to \n\nimplement some computational methods already documented, replicating the same \n\nresults. Furthermore, we found some conceptual and computational failures of these \n\nmethods, never reported until now in the literature (at least from our knowledge). We \n\ntried to improve these methods developing, for example, a full 3D computational model \n\nof the hydrogen atom in the SED framework. We adapted algorithms already existent and \n\nour own algorithms to study the electron behaviour in the hydrogen atom immersed in a \n\nmodified ZPF, since we cannot find such study in the literature. For the hydrogen atom, \n\napproximating it to the harmonic oscillator, we first study its equilibrium radius for the \n\n                                                 \n3 QED treats the electromagnetic ZPF as virtual photons, while in the SED realm these fluctuations are \n\nseen as real electromagnetic waves, making this concept more intuitive.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nfree space by numerical means, obtaining the same result (already documented) as using \n\nanalytical means. Next, we make the same for a modified ZPF cavity, being possible to \n\nconfirm the expected equilibrium radius decreasing for smaller cavities. Despite the \n\nprevious advances (discovers and algorithm improvements which can be used in future \n\nworks to study new atomic systems) in the literature, we also contribute to science with \n\nexperimental investigation:  \n\n1) we make a qualitative analysis of the radiation emitted from ground-state atoms \n\npassing through Casimir cavities for higher energies, in contrast with the \n\nquantitative analysis for lower energies already made in the past;  \n\n2) we propose and implement experimentally a new concept, which involves the \n\nexcitation of the previous atoms, to study the radiative shifts in level transitions \n\ninduced by Casimir cavities. \n\nIn chapter 2 we introduce SED with special focus on the Hydrogen atom. In that \n\nchapter, we attempt to treat the Hydrogen atom in the SED framework by means of \n\nnumerical integration using a one-dimensional ZPF. Next, in chapter 3, we discuss the \n\nZPF computational generation methods focusing in a 3D ZPF topology. With this more \n\ncredible method to generate the ZPF, and using approximations related with the harmonic \n\noscillator, we estimate the averaged ground-state radius variation induced by the \n\nimmersion of a Hydrogen atom in a modified ZPF cavity. Lastly in chapter 3, we develop \n\nand test a 3D model of the Hydrogen atom in the SED realm, using a 3D ZPF. In chapter \n\n4, we schematize a conceptual method to extract energy from the ZPF taking into account \n\nthe effects studied in the previous chapters. There we make some references to previous \n\nworks, propose possible improvements and discuss different hypothesis and \n\ncorrespondent application ideas. In the end of the chapter we present some experimental \n\nlimitations which can influence the theoretical methods. In chapter 5, we propose an \n\nexperimental apparatus to study the hypothesis presented in the previous chapter. We give \n\nsome details about the experiment instrumentation and finish the chapter with some \n\nsimulations of physical effects which take place in the experiment. In chapter 6, we \n\npresent the experimental results: from the preliminary tests to the main experiment. \n\nFinally we discuss the results and suggest future improvements and new experiments.  \n\n1.1. Objectives \n\nIn this work we intend to study the remote possibility of extracting energy from the \n\nvacuum. We do not intend to project an industrial system but only to develop an \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nexperimental method and apparatus to validate our hypothesis, which have their \n\nfoundations in SED [6].  \n\nWe intend to study ground-state shifts in atoms induced by Casimir cavities. For this \n\nwe will force the flow of gases (monoatomic and polyatomic) through metal-coated \n\nmembranes with pores of the order of a few tens of nanometres. At the same time, we \n\nwill make a spectral analysis of the radiation emitted in the UV and part of the visible \n\nregions. To study some radiative shifts in atomic transitions, we also intend to excite the \n\ngases with UV radiation and analyse the radiation emitted from those that pass through \n\nthe porous membrane. Lastly we will study the shift in the molecular ground state induced \n\nby the Casimir cavity. For this, we intend to dissociate the molecules before they enter \n\nthe membrane and analyse the radiation emitted by the ones that recombine inside the \n\npores. \n\n1.2. Motivation \n\nThe conceptual importance of the development of SED is in itself great since this \n\nmodel intends to be a unified theory. It is even more fundamental than QM since SED is \n\na dynamical description of the atomic systems while QM is seen as an averaged \n\ndescription [27][28]. This consequently means also a better understanding of the QM \n\nwhich could lead to advances in technologic areas as quantum computation and \n\nsuperconductive materials, among others. \n\nDespite this, our main motivation is to study the possibility of developing a method \n\nto extract energy from an almost inexhaustible source, available everywhere. If we \n\nintegrate all the ZPF\u2019s modes until the Planck frequency (1043 Hz), the computed energy \n\ndensity of the vacuum is in the 10113 J m3?  order of magnitude, greater than any known \n\nenergy source and also greater than the actual technological requirements [2]. \n\nThe rising needs of energy in our society, the ending of the oil reservoirs and the \n\ndangers of nuclear power plants may lead to an energetic crisis. It\u2018s clear the enormous \n\nneed to study new energy sources capable of satisfying the requirements of future \n\ngenerations. \n\nEven this hypothesis being a remote possibility, the science is made of attempts, with \n\nonly a small part of them having success. In this case, the risk is justified by the \n\nachievement. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n1.3. State of art \n\nIn the literature, scientific works about energy extraction from the ZPF are rare. \n\nHowever we attempted to collect some information about what was done in this area and \n\nresume here the most relevant aspects. \n\nAn extensive review was made by Valone and published in the book with ref. [1]. \n\nThis work resumes some of the last attempts to harness the Zero-Point Energy (ZPE), \n\neither in theoretical concepts or engineering machines. There are also some references \n\nmade to SED and the basic concept explored in the present study.  \n\nAnother review about experimental concepts to extract energy from the ZPF was \n\nmade in ref. [2]. There we find also some information about the use of gases in Casimir \n\ncavities. The main idea is to use the hypothetical ground-state shift (studied in more detail \n\nin chapter 3 of the present document) of the atoms when they are inside a cavity. As the \n\nground-state energy level is predetermined by the ZPF, inside a cavity the new ground \n\nstate of the atom will be different from the one outside and this way it could be possible \n\nto collect the corresponding energy difference. An attempt to explore this hypothesis was \n\ncarried out by Puthoff et al. (2001) but, according to ref. [2], such investigation was not \n\ncompleted. The experimental apparatus allowed passing H2 gas through a 1 ?m Casimir \n\ncavity suppressing the frequencies resonant with the ground state molecule vibrations. It \n\nwas suggested that, in this scenario, the molecule dissociation energy would increase. To \n\nprove this hypothesis, the experiment was planned in the Synchrotron Radiation Center \n\nat the University of Wisconsin (Madison, USA), where an intense UV beam used to \n\ndisassociate the gas molecules could be generated. However, a problem with the \n\nsynchrotron beam made the conclusion of the experiment to be impossible.  \n\nIn ref. [29], Puthoff et al., in addition to some exotics concepts about a propulsion \n\nsystem to interstellar travels based on ZPF, also mention the shifts in atoms when they \n\nare inside a Casimir cavity. They also claim to lead experimental investigations about this \n\nsubject in their laboratories but without success so far.  \n\nMore recently, in 2012, an attempt was made to detect radiation from ground-state \n\ngases flowing through porous gold-coated membranes (forming the Casimir cavities). \n\nThis work [8] was not conclusive. However, it presents some interesting results. Because \n\nof the importance of this work to our study, we will describe it in detail in section 4.1.1. \n\nRelated with this last investigation, there is also a patent [30]. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n2. Stochastic electrodynamics \n\nIn this chapter, we introduce Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED) with special focus \n\nin its description of the Hydrogen atom. Then we describe an algorithm for computational \n\nsimulation of this system and, finally, we present results of the implementation of this \n\nalgorithm. \n\nHere, using a method described in the literature for the first time, we computed the \n\norbit radius of the hydrogen atom for longer times and found some inconsistences with \n\nthe theory. \n\n2.1. Introduction to Stochastic Electrodynamics \n\nStochastic Electrodynamics, also named Random Electrodynamics, is basically a \n\nmodern extension of the classic electron theory of Lorentz, and also a continuation of the \n\ninvestigations of Einstein, Planck, Nernst and Stern, but with different choices of the \n\nboundary conditions and the inclusion of the relativity theory [3]. \n\nAccording to the SED formulation, particles are described classically as point \n\ncharges interacting with a background of random classical electromagnetic zero-point \n\nfield4 (ZPF) with the energy spectrum described in equation (1), equal to the one used in \n\nQM [7]. \n\n \n?(?) =\n\n??3\n\n2?2?3\n (1) \n\n \n\nIn equation (1), ? is the angular frequency5 of the waves, ? the ligth speed in vacuum \n\nand ? the reduced Planck constant. This particular spectrum (proportional to ?3) is the \n\nonly one that is Lorentz invariant [7]. The proportionality constant was calculated from \n\ncomparison with experiments on the van der Waals forces, yielding an energy per normal \n\nmode of \n1\n\n2\n??. Then ? does not have any relation with QM or quantization, it is only a \n\nscale factor [3][31]. Consequently, the ZPF waves can be obtained from the Maxwell\u2019s \n\nequations as a non-zero homogeneous solution. \n\n                                                 \n4 When we refer to ZPF, it is the zero point field at temperature zero, we are not considering thermal \n\nradiation effects.  \n5 Throughout this document the symbol ? will be always associated to the angular frequency, the reader \nshouldn\u2019t confuse it with frequency.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nEven not comparable with the QED success, SED has solved and predicted several \n\neffects before only explained in the QED realm. Some examples are the Casimir and van \n\nder Waals forces, the Planck blackbody radiation and the thermal effects of acceleration \n\nthrough the vacuum [7]. SED also produced great results in linear systems such as the \n\nharmonic oscillator. Boyer has shown that the moments ??? ? of a harmonic oscillator \n\nimmersed in the ZPF have the same behaviour than the quantum harmonic oscillator in \n\nthe ground state [32]. That is the same to say that the Heisenberg uncertainty relation is \n\nsatisfied for the SED harmonic oscillator, being its probability distribution the same than \n\nthe QM harmonic oscillator in the ground state [32]. This remarkable result suggests that \n\nthe random character of ZPF leads to the familiar probabilistic behaviour of QM, making \n\nSED a good candidate to expand our comprehension of the nature fundamentals. QM also \n\npredicts for the harmonic oscillator a discrete multi-resonance spectrum at the harmonics \n\nof the oscillator natural frequency [33], while the ordinary classical harmonic oscillator \n\nsupports however a single resonance frequency corresponding to its natural frequency. \n\nFortunately, an investigation using a computational method similar to the one explored in \n\nthe present work showed that the addition of the ZPF to the classical description of the \n\noscillator gives rise to a discrete excitation spectrum equal to the one predicted by QM \n\n[33]. This result suggests that even the quantization seems to be a natural consequence of \n\nthe ZPF addition to the classic mechanics, while in the QM case the quantization seems \n\nto be an imposed non-intuitive characteristic.  \n\nA very famous classical problem, the Bohr atom stability, was also treated with \n\nsuccess by SED, whereby the electron according to the Rutherford planetary model would \n\nabsorb energy from the ZPF, which would balance the energy lost by radiation damping, \n\nknown characteristic of an accelerated charge. This mechanism was demonstrated with \n\nsuccess for the Hydrogen atom ground state [6][7].  \n\nFor a better understanding of this physical model (SED), the reader can consult, in \n\nref. [6], an extensive paper of Boyer (1975) with the most important SED foundations or, \n\nfor more recent reviews, refs. [34] [40]. \n\nAlong the years, some investigators have abandoned SED since it failed for non-\n\nlinear systems [35]. However, others persisted and presently there is still investigation \n\nbeing done in this area. The advances in computational simulation represented a new hope \n\nfor the SED development. The numerical integration allows solving the SED equations, \n\nbefore hard to solve analytically. Some recent works, as the ones performed by Cole et \n\nal. for the Hydrogen atom [35][36], and by Huang and Batelaan for the harmonic \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\noscillator [33][32], have demonstrated the great potential of SED. These classical \n\nsimulations related with the interaction of a planetary-like orbiting electron with radiation \n\nrepresent not only a development for SED, but can also have practical implications such \n\nas the understanding of Rydberg atoms interacting with radiation [35]. Herewith, there is \n\nthe possibility of controlling the chemical and atomic proprieties of the atoms by means \n\nof irradiation or resonant cavity confinement [36][37].   \n\nA modern version of SED that includes the spin (SEDS) seems to be very promising \n\nsince it solves some of the SED failures such as the non-linear potentials [38]. This \n\nmodification drastically changes the motion equation of electrically charged particles in \n\nthe ordinary SED realm, because the spin addition reaffirms the influence of the special \n\nrelativity. SEDS was also able to derivate the Bohr\u2019s complete condition, including the \n\nexcited states. SEDS can even explain some phenomena presently unexplainable by QED, \n\nnamely:  \n\n1) the physical origin of the ZPF, and its natural upper cut-off;  \n\n2) an anomaly in experimental studies of neutrino rest mass;  \n\n3) the origin and quantitative studies of 1/f noise;  \n\n4) the origin of the high-energy tail of cosmic radiation.  \n\nThis success is due to the fact that SEDS (like SED) consider a real ZPF in contrast \n\nwith QED, which makes the ZPF renormalization [38].  \n\nOther variations of SED were suggested in recent investigations with emphasis to \n\nRodr\u00edguez [28], who demonstrates that SED needs some feedback mechanism for the \n\nparticles to store energy across their random motion in order to maintain their averaged \n\nequilibrium. It was suggested that the inner structure of the particles could have the \n\nfreedom degrees necessary to store energy from ZPF when it is in excess and to release it \n\nfor the atomic system when it is in defect. This new view of SED could bring new \n\nadvances, as in the angular momentum quantization and in the excited states of the atoms, \n\namong others [28]. \n\n2.2. Hydrogen atom according to stochastic electrodynamics \n\nSince the main goal of our work is to study the influence of the ZPF in atoms and the \n\nperturbations in their energy levels induced by modifications on ZPF, we start with the \n\nsimplest scenario, the Hydrogen (H) atom.   \n\nAs it is known since long time, the classical description of the H atom is not \n\nconsistent with the reality. Any charged particle in an accelerated motion emits Larmor \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nradiation losing progressively its energy [8]. Then, despite of the Coulomb force that \n\nmaintains the electron in a circular orbit, the Abraham-Lorentz force (product of the \n\nradiation reaction) makes the electron quickly collapsing in a spiral orbit towards the \n\nnucleus [35][36], whose decay rate is shown in figure 1.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1: The electron orbit radius of an H atom as a function of time according to \n\nthe classical theory. Computed with the explicit Runge-Kutta method (ode45 \n\nMATLAB\u2019s internal function with absolute error tolerance 9 \u00d7 107). \n\n \n\nSED solves this orbital instability problem with the addition of a random \n\nelectromagnetic background even at zero Kelvin, the ZPF [6][7]. This ZPF is the classical \n\ndescription of the one predicted by QM.  \n\nThe energy lost by the electron in the form of Larmor radiation is by these means \n\ncompensated by the energy absorbed from the ZPF\u2019s electric and magnetic fields [8]. This \n\nequilibrium is not static but dynamical instead, due to the random character of ZPF, which \n\ncauses the electron orbit to acquire a radius distribution in time instead of a static radius, \n\nas it will be shown in the next sections. Then, when we refer to stability it is not about a \n\nfixed orbit but stability over time, which converges to a fixed orbit radius when we \n\ncompute the average over all orbit radii for a time long enough. Some authors claim that \n\nQM is a static description of property averages but in reality these systems have a frenetic \n\nrandom behaviour induced by ZPF [28]. Hence, SED or some SED version could be a \n\nmore fundamental theory of the nature than QM. \n\nLooking for the SED\u2019s fundamentals, it is reasonable to think that ZPF determines \n\nthe orbit radius distribution of an electron in the atom, and consequently the ground state \n\nenergy level is imposed by the ZPF. It then could be possible to influence the atom \n\nproperties by means of the manipulation of ZPF. \n\nSED has been successful for linear systems such as the harmonic oscillator and for \n\nlinear fields in Casimir/van der Waals type simulations [6]. However, for non-linear \n\nsystems, the results seem not to converge with the ones generated by QM [35]. It has been \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nsuggested that this discrepancy was due to the difficulties to deal analytically with non-\n\nlinear differential equations, and then that non-linear systems (such as the Coulomb \n\npotential in the H atom) can be successfully solved using numeric simulations [35][36]. \n\nIn this chapter, we review, replicate and comment some of the work done regarding the \n\nelectron motion in the H atom by means of numerical integration, with special focus on \n\nref. [35]. \n\n2.2.1.  Motion of the electron in the H atom according to SED \n\nIn this section we based mostly on the paper of Cole and Zou [35], however other \n\nimportant works are complementary to this, as refs. [31][36]. In the present work, we tried \n\nto replicate the results achieved in ref. [35], related to the electron radius distribution in \n\nthe classic H atom, using the same terminology and similar approximations. We were still \n\nable to make some simulations for longer times relative to the simulations reported in the \n\nbibliography. In these simulations, we found for the first time some unexpected orbital \n\nbehaviours, such as extremely elliptic orbits and a continuous tendency of the electron \n\norbit to outer radius. This observation may arise some doubts concerning the model or \n\neven the theory stability. \n\nIn order to simplify the H atom model, we made some approximations. Since the \n\nproton is much heavier than the electron, we considered the proton mass infinite and the \n\nH nucleus motionless in the origin of our referential.  We also considered the non-\n\nrelativist approximation since the electron speed is much lower than the speed of light \n\n(approximately two orders of magnitude lower as we will show in the results section). \n\nThus, the Newton\u2019s second law of motion is given by equation 2 (in SI units) [35]. \n\n \n?\n\n?2?\n\n??2\n= ?\n\n?2?\n\n4??0|?|\n3\n\n+  \n2?2\n\n3?3\n1\n\n4??0\n\n?3?\n\n??3\n? ? {?[?(?), ?] +\n\n??\n\n ??\n\u00d7 ?[?(?), ?]} (2) \n\nIn equation (2), ? and ? are respectively the electron charge and mass, ? is the electron \n\nposition vector, ?0 the vacuum permittivity, ? the light speed in vacuum and, finally, ? \n\nand ? are respectively the electric and magnetic field vectors of the ZPF [35]. The first \n\nterm in the right side of equation (2) is the Coulomb force and the second term is the \n\nradiation reaction, a force that is characteristic of all accelerated charge systems. Since \n\nthe Coulomb attractive force is the dominating force in the electron orbit, the third order \n\nderivate of the radiation reaction term can be approximated by equation (3). \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n?3?\n\n??3\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n(?\n\n1\n\n?\n\n?2?\n\n4??0|?|\n3\n\n) ?\n?2\n\n?\n[\n\n??\n??\n\n|?|3\n?\n\n3?(? ?\n??\n??\n\n)\n\n|?|5\n] (3) \n\n \n\nIn order to complete equation (2), we must define the ZPF electric and magnetic \n\nfields. However, once again some considerations are required since it is impossible to \n\ngenerate numerically the infinite number of modes of the ZPF. For each ZPF mode, a \n\nwave number was associated, in the form of a vector ? that defines the propagation \n\ndirection of each wave. It is also possible to associate to ? an angular frequency (?) given \n\nby ? = ?|?|. In the free space all the modes are allowed, thus ZPF takes the integral form \n\nmaking the numerical modes generation impossible. However, in a bounded space, such \n\nas a box of perfectly reflective walls at zero potential, not all the ? modes are allowed \n\n[35][32]. The bound conditions impose that all the waves have two nodes coincident with \n\nthe walls, thus the wavelengths can only be integers of half the box dimension. Hence we \n\ncan simulate the H atom inside a big cubic box and still have a good approximation to the \n\nfree space. Consequently, the electric part of the ZPF can be described by a plane wave \n\nexpansion, as shown in equation (4), solution of the homogeneous Maxwell\u2019s equations \n\nin a bounded space [35][32]. \n\n \n????(?, ?) =  \n\n1\n\n?(?? ?? ?? )\n\n?  ? ?????,?[???,? cos(?? ? ? ? ???)\n\n?=1,2\n\n?\n\n??,??,??=??\n\n+ ???,? sin(?? ? ? ? ???)] \n\n(4) \n\nIn equation (4), ? is the electron position vector and ? the time. Since the waves are \n\nrelated with integer multiples of the box dimensions, it was convenient to associate each \n\nwave to the index ?, so ?? , ??  and ??  take only integer values. The wave number of each \n\nwave is then given by ?? = 2? (\n??\n\n??\n??? +  \n\n??\n\n??\n??? +  \n\n??\n\n??\n???), where ?? , ?? and ?? are the box \n\ndimensions [35]. We can also define for future references the box volume by \n\n? = ??  ?? ??. Each wave frequency can be computed from ?? = ?|??|. According to \n\nSED, the waves don\u2019t have a preferential polarization, so each wave contains two \n\npolarization components orthogonal to the propagation direction [35]. The symbol ? \n\nrepresents each of these polarizations and consequently we have ?? ? ?????,? = 0 and ?????,? ?\n\n?????,?\u00b4 = 0 for ? ? ?\u00b4. The constants ???,? and ???,? are real numbers generated randomly \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nin the beginning of each simulation [35]. The algorithm to generate these random numbers \n\nwas designed so that the numbers are generated according to a Gaussian distribution with \n\ncentroid at zero and second moment equal to ????,?\n2 ? = ????,?\n\n2 ? =\n???\n\n2?0\n ,which corresponds \n\nto the spectral distribution of the ZPF, described by the equation (1) [35]. \n\nAlternatively, we can represent the ZPF in another form, this new representation \n\nbeing used in chapter 3. In equation 4 the random character of the ZPF appears in the \n\nform of random generated amplitudes in two trigonometric functions, however this is \n\nequivalent to one fixed amplitude trigonometric function with random generated phase \n\n[6]. And thus we can express ????(?, ?) as in equation 5 [32]. \n\n \n\n????(?, ?) =  \n1\n\n?(?? ?? ?? )\n\n?  ? ?????,? [?\n???\n?0\n\ncos(?? ? ? ? ??? + ??)]\n\n?=1,2\n\n?\n\n??,??,??=??\n\n (5) \n\nEven being equation (4) a discrete sum of waves, since the index ? takes infinite \n\nvalues (positive and negative), to limit the number of waves it is then required to define \n\na minimum (????) and maximum (????) frequencies. The minimum frequency may \n\ncorrespond to the largest wave allowed in the box and the maximum frequency will \n\ndetermine the minimum radius for which the simulation is valid [35].  \n\nThe magnetic part of the ZPF is easily generated from the electric part. Thus \n\n???? (?, ?) is obtained from equation (4) by replacing ?????,? by \n1\n\n?\n???? \u00d7 ?????,? [35]. \n\nWe are now capable of integrating the differential equation (2) and in that way \n\ntracking the electron in the H atom.  \n\n2.2.2. Approximations and algorithm implementation \n\nAn exact implementation of the method described in the last section would be \n\ncomputationally very heavy and the integration of equation (2) would be very slow. Some \n\nmore approximations are then required, as proposed in ref. [35]. The starting point is \n\nrestricting the electron motion to a single plane (?? plane) and then eliminating the \n\nnumber of possible waves. Since we forced the electron motion in the ?? plane, we need \n\nto eliminate the waves which can induce a force in the ? axis6, yet preserving the validity \n\nof the relevant physical effects. For this we made the box in such a way that the \n\n                                                 \n6 As in simulations, these waves don\u2019t make any difference in the electron motion, they will only waste \n\nCPU time. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\ndimensions in the ? and ? axis are so small that there are not any waves travelling in these \n\ndirections, so there are only waves travelling in the direction orthogonal to the plane ??. \n\nOf course in reality there will always be waves of higher frequencies travelling in these \n\ndirections (? and ?) but these ZPF frequencies are too high to influence an electron whose \n\nfrequency is much lower, so it is not necessary to generate these waves. This \n\napproximation is just the same as to make ?? and ?? equal to zero in equation (4). \n\nConsequently, for the simulated radius range, the electron will only interact with the \n\nwaves propagating in the ? direction (positive and negative). And by definition, the \n\nelectric fields ???? (?, ?) of such waves (and the related forces) have components only in \n\nthe ?? plane. The magnetic fields ???? (?, ?) of these waves and the electron speed vector \n\nhave components only in the ?? plane, so the resulting force will only have a component \n\nin the ? direction, making the interaction of the electron with ???? (?, ?) absent in the 2D \n\napproximation. Thereby only the electric part of the ZPF remains, enabling a decrease to \n\nhalf the number of waves that would be present in the free space. Furthermore, as we \n\ngenerate only the waves in the ? direction, we decrease the total number of waves to the \n\ncubic root. \n\nNow we define the box size, as in ref. [35], ?? = ?? = 37,4 \u00c5 (much longer than the \n\nBohr radius ? 0.529 \u00c5 ) and ?? = 40 850 000 \u00c5 = 0,41 cm.  \n\nAs mentioned before, we also need to define ???? and ????. The relation between \n\neach frequency and each ?? is easily obtained from equation (6). And the relation between \n\na radius and its resonant frequency is given by equation (7) that was obtained equalising \n\nthe centripetal and Coulomb forces. \n\n \n??? =\n\n2??\n\n??\n?? (6) \n\n \n\n? = ?\n?2\n\n4??0??\n3\n (7) \n\nThe minimum frequency allowed in the box is the one for which ?? = 1. This ???? \n\nis also the orbiting frequency of a circular orbit of radius ???? = 1,06 \u00d7 10\n?7 ?, which \n\nis the maximum radius the electron can achieve. If this value is exceeded, the simulation \n\nis not valid; in that case no wave would influence the electron, and it would be the same \n\nas the inexistence of ZPF. We have chosen ???? = 1 \u00d7 10\n?11 ?, and therefore???? to \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nbe generated is 5,03 \u00d7 1017??1. The box size (??  and ??) was also made in such way \n\nthat ???? of the waves traveling in the plane ?? is 5,04 \u00d7 10\n17??1, thus for the electron \n\nradius there are no resonant waves travelling in the plane ??. \n\nEven after all these approximations, the time required to track the electron, during \n\nfor example 1 \u00d7 10?11 ? in a personal computer, could be much longer than 1 month. \n\nOne more important approximation is therefore needed. Since the electron absorbs energy \n\nmostly from waves in resonance with its orbital frequency, we will use a window of \n\nfrequencies at each iteration of the integration. This window (??) is defined by a \n\nminimum and a maximum frequencies that are related with a maximum and a minimum \n\nradius, respectively. As suggested by Cole et al. in ref. [35], ?? should include all the \n\nwaves between two frequencies, which correspond to the two radius, ?? = ? ? 0,03? and \n\n?+ = ? + 0,03?, where ? is the instantaneous radius at each iteration. This window is not \n\nstatic, instead it changes its width and centroid as the electron is closer or further away \n\nfrom the nucleus. The aim is to compute in each integration the resulting force of all the \n\nwaves near the electron resonance frequency since the other waves wouldn\u2019t have a \n\nsignificant influence in the electron motion. \n\n2.2.3. Results of the simulations \n\nWe ran our code (implemented in MATLAB) in three personal computers. We made \n\nseveral simulations during several months. It was interesting to notice that some \n\nsimulations were taking much longer times than others. The reason is the difference in \n\ntime that the algorithm takes to integrate small and large orbits, the last ones being quickly \n\nintegrated.  \n\nThe initial conditions of the electron were the Bohr radius (~5.3 \u00d7 10?11 ?) and the \n\ncorrespondent velocity (~2.2 \u00d7 106 ?/?). \n\nThe approximations taken are the same as explained in the last section, except that \n\nwe generated only waves travelling in the positive direction. However, due to the random \n\ncharacter of the waves\u2019 amplitude, we expect similar results. We then integrated the \n\nelectron motion for 32 independent atoms, each one for a unique ZPF generated at the \n\nbeginning of each run.  \n\nThe outputs of each run are the electron position and velocity (saved in time intervals \n\nof 6 \u00d7 10?17 ?) as a function of time. From this information, in order to visualize the \n\n\u201celectronic cloud\u201d, we can plot all the positions that the electron took. We can also plot \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nthe orbit radius as a function of time or the absolute frequency histogram of the electron \n\nradius. As example, the electron radius as a function of time is plotted in figure 2, where \n\nwe can see a stochastic variation of the electron radius. \n\nAs an attempt to replicate the results of Cole and Zou [35], we made for each \n\nsimulation a frequency histogram and then we summed all the histograms to accumulate \n\nstatistic. The resulting histogram is the orbit radius distribution of the electron according \n\nto SED. We didn\u2019t take into account the first 5 \u00d7 10?13 seconds to reduce the initial \n\nconditions influence in the histogram. To visualise the histogram variation with the \n\namount of statistics accumulated, we plotted four histograms computed for increasing \n\ntimes, the results being shown in figure 3. We denote by ???? the amount of entries in \n\neach histogram, the sum of all the absolute frequencies (the curve integral). To compare \n\nthe electron orbit radius distribution in the SED framework with the correspondent QM \n\nprediction, we also plotted the radial density curve ?(?), from the Schrodinger\u2019s wave \n\nequation for the ground state of the H atom. This last curve was normalised to the \n\nhistogram in such a way that the areas under the two curves are the same. ?(?) is given \n\n(in CGS units) by equation (8): \n\n ?(?) = ?\n4?2\n\n??\n3 exp (?\n\n2?\n\n??\n)   (8) \n\nwhere ?? =\n?\n\n2\n\n?? 2\n, and A is the normalization constant [35].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Plot of the electron orbit radius variation with time for one simulation. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nAs we can see from the figure 3, the radius distribution computed by our algorithm \n\nseems to converge to the QM prediction, and this notable remark was first observed by \n\nCole and Zou [35]. This result validates our algorithm and thus we can use the code for \n\nother proposes, such as simulations with other initial conditions, research for excited \n\nstates or even adapt it for multi-electron models as the He atom. \n\nAfter this test, we performed additional tests with the same model for an atom inside \n\na smaller cavity. We started to decrease only ??, however since ?? and ?? are already too \n\nsmall the increment of the normalization constant in equation (4), which depends on the \n\nbox dimensions, gives higher amplitudes to the waves. These very intense waves induced \n\ncolossal variations in the electron orbit radius, always kicking it for growing elliptic \n\norbits. We still tried to manipulate ?? and ?? to decrease the wave amplitudes, yet it \n\nresulted again in strong resonant effects (now of lower amplitude), where the electron \n\ncould maintain an immutable elliptic orbit for a long time without significant random \n\nfluctuations. We suspect these results are due to the large spacing between adjacent \n\nfrequencies (characteristic of the small box) in addition to the fact that, for this one-\n\ndimensional ZPF, there are few waves of similar frequencies. Using a full three-\n\n                \n\n                      \n\nFigure 3: Electron orbit radius distribution (in red ) computed for increasing time ranges. \n\nThe amount of histogram entries ???? is: a) 5.2 \u00d7 10\n5; b) 9.6 \u00d7 105; c) 25.6 \u00d7 105; d) 36.2 \u00d7\n\n105.

Anyway, the one-dimensional ZPF doesn\u2019t seem to us \n\na credible approximation, as we will explain better in the beginning of the next chapter.  \n\nFortunately we had access to a computer cluster and during this time we tried to \n\nevaluate the model stability. According to SED, the electron orbit should be stable, so if \n\nthe model is stable the electron orbit radius should not have a tendentious behaviour along \n\ntime, but instead it would always have a random motion without colliding against the \n\nnucleus or ionize, whatever the simulation time. In addition to this, for a long enough \n\ntime, the radius distribution of a single simulation should be similar to the Schrodinger \n\nequation prediction, without the need of accumulating statistics from other simulations. \n\nWe run the previous 2D-algorithm (this time implemented in C++) for longer times, \n\ngenerating waves travelling in positive and negative directions. We made a set of 16 \n\nsimulations up to 10?9 ?. Some of them didn\u2019t reach the end time because the electron \n\ncrossed the radius limits (???? and ????), forcing the simulation to stop. To validate the \n\nimplementation of this algorithm in C++, we computed the radius distribution (of the 16 \n\nsimulations summed up) accounting for shorter times only. The solution seems also to \n\nconverge with the QM prediction, as shown in figure 4. However, for longer times the \n\nresult seems to deviate from the QM prediction, as shown in figure 5. From the various \n\nplots we often see a tendentious motion, either to outer orbits or to the nucleus direction. \n\nHowever, we don\u2019t know what would happen for radius shorter than ???? = 10\n?11 ?, \n\nmaybe the electron can collide with the nucleus, or can return to outer orbits, thus keeping \n\nthe atomic stability. Thus, the growth towards outer orbits for longer times (figure 5) is \n\nin part due to the stopped simulations, remaining only the simulations that never reached \n\nthe minimum radius. This aspect can be improved in the future by decreasing the \n\nminimum radius, however there will always be a computational limitation. For example, \n\nif we decrease by half the actual minimum radius, the number of ZPF generated modes \n\nwill be doubled. In addition, in some cases we also observe a continuous tendency \n\ntowards outer orbits with extremely elliptic behaviours, an effect shown, for example, in \n\nfigure 6. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4:  In blue, the electron radius distribution (histogram) computed from all \n\nthe 16 simulations summed up (5 \u00d7 10?12 ?), accounting for shorter times.

Thus, we can \n\nconclude that, for longer times, either this method is not stable or the approximations used \n\nare not suitable, or still SED is incomplete.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6:  The left plot is the radius variation with time. The right plot is the \n\ncorrespondent electron position in the xy plane.  \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n3. Three-dimensional ZPF  \n\nAlthough it was used in the past, the one-dimensional representation of ZPF is not \n\nrealistic. Even if we consider a parallelepiped box as Cole and Zou [35], where one \n\ndimension is much bigger than the others, it\u2019s not a good approximation of the free space. \n\nTo evaluate this affirmation we can consider the model described by Cole and Zou, \n\nexplained in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 [35]. If we make Lx and Ly small enough to suppress \n\nall the waves in resonance7 with the electron radius down to 10?11 ?, the only ones that \n\ncontribute to the radius fluctuations are the waves propagating in the z direction. Then we \n\ncan make Lz big enough to consider the H atom in free space. However, the normalization \n\nfactor (\n1\n\n???\u00d7??\u00d7??\n) in equation (4) depends not only on the Lz dimension but also on Ly \n\nand Lx, so the box size (Lz, Lx and Ly) dictates the waves\u2019 amplitude. Consequently, \n\nalthough we fix Lz, which preserves the number of modes inside the box, by changing Lx \n\nand/or Ly the resulting electron behaviour induced by the ZPF will be different, since the \n\nnormalization factor influences the waves\u2019 amplitude. In conclusion, if the purpose is to \n\nsimulate the free space, a model that gives us different results to the same problem cannot \n\nbe fully right.  \n\nAn alternative is to use a cubic cavity with the three dimensions large enough to \n\nconsider the atom in free space. Thus k is distributed uniformly in a cubic mesh. This \n\nmethod is nothing more than the direct application of equation (4). However, as Cole et \n\nal. noticed, it can be computationally very hard. As the number of waves present in the \n\nbox is raised to the cube, while in the previous method we dealt with approximately 106 \n\nelements in a matrix, now in a cubic box there will be 1018 elements in a matrix. \n\nIn this chapter, we treat the ZPF in a cubic box, meaning that the propagation vector \n\nof the waves will have three-dimensional components. We started with a method, which \n\nwill be called \u201cSpherical Method\u201d, to generate a 3D ZPF. In the annexe 8.1 we refer two \n\nworks that introduced this method. There, we also implement some of these ideas using \n\nMATLAB and replicate with success some effects. In section 3.1, we develop our own \n\nmethod, the Perfect Box Method, and an algorithm that better satisfies the requirements \n\nof this work. Aiming to make a preliminary estimation of the shift of the averaged radius \n\n                                                 \n7 The term \u201cwaves in resonance\u201d is used for the waves whose frequency is close to the electron angular \n\nfrequency. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nof the bounded H atom, we start by resuming what is relevant in the literature and, in \n\nsection 3.2, we perform some calculations for the H atom in free space. In section 3.4, we \n\nintroduce the perturbations induced in the averaged radius of the H atom when ZPF is \n\nmodified. Finally, in sections 3.4 and 3.5, we try to compute the shift on the equilibrium \n\nradius of the H atom induced by a ZPF modification, using the Spherical Method and the \n\nPerfect Box Method. \n\nThe reader should take in account that in this chapter, up to section 3.6, we only deal \n\nwith the electric field. However, for future works, the magnetic part of the ZPF can be \n\neasily obtained (as explained in the previous chapter) from the electric part of the ZPF. \n\n3.1. Perfect box method \n\nAs discussed in annex 8.1, the spherical method can be unreliable when used in small \n\nboxes where the density of k-vectors in the k-space is too low (corresponding to a small \n\nnumber of waves N), a situation for which the spherical method does not work so well \n\nalso, since it does not preserve real geometrical k-vector characteristics. Therefore, we \n\nneed to find a more realistic description of ZPF to simulate the effects of bounded ZPF, \n\nthe main purpose of this work. The simplest, realistic and computational achievable form \n\nof representing the waves inside a cubic box is to generate a set of k-vectors in a perfect \n\ncubic mesh between a maximum and minimum frequencies. This method is also \n\nimportant to generate a trusty ZPF for future simulations where accuracy is the main \n\nrequirement, as it is in our case. \n\nSince we have not found in the literature an algorithm to generate such ZPF, we \n\ndeveloped one and implemented it in MATLAB. This algorithmic is described in the \n\nfollowing paragraphs.  \n\nFirst, a set of points is generated, each point described by three coordinates, \n\nrepresented by a matrix of integers. These points correspond to a perfect cubic mesh in a \n\nCartesian space. The maximum possible integer (???? ) generated is computed from the \n\nmaximum frequency, which is related with the defined maximum radius of the electron \n\norbit, according to equation (9).  \n\n \n???? =\n\n????? \n2??\n\n (9) \n\nAfter that, an iterative algorithm removes the points whose frequency is greater than \n\n???? or lower than ????. The iterative algorithm also creates new points between the \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\noriginal points, increasing the number of points in the matrix by a factor of 8 in each \n\niteration and always eliminating the points outside the frequency window. We have made \n\nthis iterative method because it was computationally too heavy to create all the points in \n\nthe beginning (since the quantity would be huge) and then cut out the ones outside ??. \n\nTherefore, we refine the mesh iteratively cutting always the edges (i.e. the points outside \n\n??) at each iteration. The result is a 3D spherical layer of integer points (each one \n\ndescribed by 3 coordinates) whose width is proportional to the difference between the \n\nmaximum and minimum frequencies. As an example, a slice on the plane ? = 0 of these \n\npoints (integer version of ?-vectors) is plotted in figure 7, where the cubic disposition of \n\nthe points is perceptible. \n\nThis spherical layer of integer points is saved together with 2 more random numbers \n\nassociated to each point, completing all we need to describe the ZPF according to our \n\napproximations. Each of these random numbers was generated uniformly between 0 and \n\n2?. They will constitute the random phase for each polarization of the wave described by \n\neach ?-vector. Finally the correct ?-vector matrix is obtained from the multiplication of \n\nthe integer points saved by the space between adjacent ?-vectors (??), which in turn is \n\nrelated with the box volume and described by equation (10).  \n\n \n?? =\n\n2?\n\n?\n (10) \n\n \n\nFigure 7: 2D representation of the integer points (blue dots) related to ?-vectors in the \n\nplane ? = 0. The points outwards the two limits (red circles), related to a maximum and a \n\nminimum frequency, were taken out. This sample was generated for the Bohr radius, for a box \n\nof side (?) equal to 400 ?m. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nIt\u2019s important to note the difficulties of a trusty generation of the ZPF in free space. \n\nFor example, the number of ?-vectors generated for a cubic box of ? = 400 ?? for all \n\nthe frequencies resonating with the radius between ???? = 10\n?11 ? and ???? = 1,06 \u00d7\n\n10?5 ? (the dimensions used by Cole et al. in Ref. [35]) is about 9\u00d71018. Accounting the \n\ntwo polarizations of the electric fields, this matrix will be doubled. As we can see, for a \n\npersonal computer, a matrix with such number of elements is impossible to save in the \n\nRAM memory. The solution we found was to create and save the ZPF (the ?-vectors and \n\nthe random numbers) into data files for different intervals of ??. Thus, when we make \n\nthe simulation of the electron motion (or other kind of simulation) we load into RAM \n\nmemory the corresponding ZPF file that contains the waves resonating with the present \n\norbit radius of the electron. This operation of constant opening and closing the files and \n\nwriting to RAM memory will make the simulation time much longer.  \n\n3.2. Equilibrium radius evaluation in the free space \n\nBoyer [6] and other authors [7] have suggested that the atomic stability (as the \n\nharmonic oscillator stability) is the result of the equilibrium between the power absorbed \n\nand the power radiated by the electrons. Let us consider the simple case of a one-\n\ndimensional harmonic oscillator of natural frequency ?0 immersed in the ZPF, located in \n\nthe origin and with its motion in the x axis. In these conditions, the motion equation is \n\ngiven by equation (11), where we use the non-relativistic Newton motion law for all the \n\nforces applied in the oscillating charge [7]. \n\n \n??? = ??0\n\n2? + ?? +\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n??? (0, ?) (11) \n\nAs we are considering an oscillating electron, the constants e and m are respectively the \n\nelectron charge and mass. ??\n??? (0, ?) is the ? component of the ZPF electric part in the \n\nreferential origin. The first term in the right side of equation (10) is the restoring force \n\ncharacteristic of the harmonic oscillator, the third term is the force induced by the ZPF \n\nspectrum, and the second term is the self-reaction term, where the constant ? is related to \n\nthe radiation damping. This characteristic damping of an accelerated charge is created by \n\nthe Abraham\u2013Lorentz force. In SI units, ? takes the form shown in equation 12 [7], \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n? =\n\n?2\n\n6??0??\n3\n (12) \n\nwhere ?0 is the permittivity of the vacuum and ? the speed of light in vacuum. \n\nAs explained in refs. [7], [32] and [36], in the case where the Coulumb force is \n\npredominant, we can simplify the self-reaction term, resulting equation (13). \n\n \n??? = ??0\n\n2? ? ??0\n2??? +\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n??? (0, ?) (13) \n\nWith equation (13) and the ZPF spectrum distribution described by equations (4) or \n\n(5), both describing the ZPF, it is possible to deduce the average power absorbed from \n\nthe ZPF by the electron, as shown in equation (14) [7]. \n\n \n?????? =  ?? ? ?? =\n\n  ?2??0\n3\n\n12??0??\n3\n (14) \n\nNow, for the H atom system, we can consider the Bohr model, in which the ground \n\nstate is described by a circular orbit of radius ?0, as two one-dimensional harmonic \n\noscillators in quadrature. Taking this argument into account, the quantity in equation (14) \n\nwill be doubled in the case of a circular orbit. As a result, according to our approximation \n\nto the circular orbit, the power absorbed will be twice the power absorbed by a single \n\nharmonic oscillator [7].  \n\nConsidering circular orbits, since a Coulomb central force is applied to an electron \n\nby a point size proton whose mass is considered infinite, the radius of the circular orbits \n\nis related with its angular frequency by the equation (14)8. \n\n \n?0 =\n\n?\n\n?4??0??0\n3\n (15) \n\nSubstituting ?0 from equation (15) in equation (14), we obtain equation (16), which gives \n\nus the average power absorbed as function of the electron radius. \n\n \n????? ????? =  \n\n  ?5 ?\n\n48 ?3(???0)\n5\n2 ?0\n\n9\n2\n\n (16) \n\n                                                 \n8 Equation (14) can be obtained by equalling the centripetal and Coulomb forces. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nTo deduce the average radiated power as function of the electron radius for the H \n\natom, we start by calculating the power radiated by an electron with acceleration A in a \n\ncircular orbit. It is given by equation (17) [7].   \n\n \n????? ????? =  \n\n  ?2 ?2\n\n6??0?\n3\n\n=\n  ?2 (?0?0\n\n2)2\n\n6??0?\n3\n\n (17) \n\nAgain, for the H atom, we can use equation (15) to obtain the radiated power as a \n\nfunction of the radius, as shown in equation (18). \n\n \n????? ????? =\n\n  ?6 \n\n96?2(???0)\n3?0\n\n3\n (18) \n\nIt is perceptible that the average powers absorbed and radiated by the electron have \n\ndifferent dependences on the electron radius. As we can see from the plot of figure 8, the \n\npower absorbed is predominant for smaller radius, while for bigger radius the radiated \n\npower is predominant. This behaviour suggests the existence of an equilibrium radius, \n\nsince for shorter radius the electron absorbs more energy from the ZPF than the one it \n\nradiates, leading to bigger orbits, and for larger radius the radiated energy is greater \n\nmaking it to decay to smaller orbits. According to this hypothesis, the average radius will \n\nbe obtained by equalling equations (16) and (18) or by the intersection of the two curves \n\n(power radiated and absorbed), as represented in figure 8. For the free space \n\napproximation, this intersection yields exactly the Bohr radius (??) [7]. \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Plot of ????  and ???? computed from equations (16) and (18) for radius between \n\n4.8 \u00d7 10?11 ? and 6.8 \u00d7 10?11 ?. The interception of the two curves is exactly ?? . \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nWe have considered the power radiated by an electron in a circular orbit as \n\nindependent on ZPF, at least when described by equation (18). On the other hand, \n\naccording with our approximations, ZPF plays a crucial rule in the absorbed power. In \n\nthis work, we are considering the hypothesis that the atom stability is due to the \n\nequilibrium between ????  and ????. Then, as ???? depends on ZPF, it is reasonable to \n\nassume that a different ZPF could result in a different equilibrium state that can change \n\nthe energies of the ground and excited states of the atomic systems. It\u2019s now clear the \n\nneed to study ???? when ZPF is changed as in the case of a cubic box of perfect metallic \n\nneutral walls. To the best of our knowledge, such study is absent in the literature. \n\n3.3. Equilibrium radius evaluation in a reflective box \n\nEquation (14) was deduced for the free space where the frequency spectrum is \n\ncontinuum, while in a box the frequencies take discrete values. From refs. [7] and [40], it \n\nis possible to deduce in SI units ????? ????? for a discrete ZPF spectrum, as seen in equation \n\n(19).  \n\n \n????? ????? =\n\n?2\n\n?\n? ?2(?)\n\n?\n\n \n? ?4\n\n(?0\n2 ?  ?2)2 +  ?2?6\n\n(1 ?\n??\n\n2\n\n|?|2\n) (19) \n\nIn equation (18), a sum is made over all waves associated to the ?-vectors and to \n\nfrequencies ?. As seen before in section 2.2.1, equations (4) and (5), the amplitude of \n\neach wave for the bonded space, as considered here, is well described by equation (20), \n\nwhere ? is the volume inside the box.. \n\n \n\n?(?) = ?\n??\n\n?0?\n (20) \n\nSince infinite multiples of the fundamental frequency are admitted in the box, even \n\ninside a small box ZPF will have infinite modes making the computation impossible. \n\nHowever, the electron in the circular orbit will absorb energy mostly from the resonance \n\nmodes. Therefore, if we select a window of modes whose frequencies (?) are close to the \n\nnatural frequency (?0), we should have a good approximation of ?\n???. To define this \n\nwindow, we must evaluate the integral of the continuum ZPF in free space for different \n\nfrequency limits.  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nIn ref. [7], before the final solution shown in equation (14), an intermediate solution \n\nwas deduced, equation (21), which takes into account the integral over all the continuum \n\nfrequency distribution of ZPF.  \n\n \n????? ????? =\n\n  ?2?\n\n3?2?0??\n3\n\n?\n? ?7 ??\n\n(?0\n2 ?  ?2)2 +  ?2?6\n\n?\n\n0\n\n (21) \n\nThe driven damped harmonic oscillator in the approximation of small damping \n\n(??0\n2 ? ?0), such as in this case\n\n9, has a strong resonating behaviour. The FWHM (Full \n\nWidth at Half Maximum) of the resonance curve (amplitude as a function of the driven \n\nfrequency) is proportional to ??0\n2. Then we can define a window (??) between a \n\nminimum and a maximum frequencies that will contain the most significant ZPF waves \n\nthat can influence the electron motion. This window must be proportional to the resonance \n\ncurve FWHM, and thus it will be dynamic since it will change with ?0 and so with ?0.  \n\nBefore computing ???? by the electron of the H atom inside a box, we need to define \n\n?? large enough to allow a good approximation. Since in a driven damped harmonic \n\noscillator, as the one we are using, described by equation (13), the damping constant \n\n(??0\n2) is proportional to the resonance curve FWHM, we also made ?? proportional to \n\n??0\n2 [32][1]. Taking as a reference the Bohr radius, ???? is calculated using equation \n\n(21) for different ?? values, being ?? = f ??0\n2, where f is an integer proportionality \n\nconstant [32]. In figure 9, we can see the resonance curve of ???? as a function of ?, \n\naccording to equation (21). \n\n                                                 \n9 For the Bohr radius, we have ??0\n\n2 = 1,071 \u00d7 1010 (?? ?? ?????) and ?0 = 4,134 \u00d7 10\n16 ???/?. \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Power absorbed ???? as a function of ? for the Bohr radius, using f = 20, which \n\ncorresponds to ? between 4.134131 \u00d7 1016 ???/?and 4.134152 \u00d7 1016 ???/?. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nAs we can see from figure 10, as large the window is, the smaller is the deviation in \n\n????. So as further away from the resonant frequency are the wave frequencies, less \n\nsignificant is their influence in the electron. Therefore, we only need to consider ?? large \n\nenough to have a small error. For example, with 400 times the quantity ??0\n2 (f = 400), \n\nwe have a deviation between the computed and the theoretical values of only 0.16%, \n\nwhich is almost negligible. \n\nThe method proposed by us to compute the equilibrium radius (???) in a box of \n\nreflective walls (considering ????  independent from the boundary conditions) starts with \n\nthe generation of a set of radius between two limits where we suppose to exist ???. Then \n\nwe compute the total absorbed power for each radius using equation (19), where the k-\n\nvalues and the correspondent ? values are from all the waves present in a box in all \n\npossible directions whose frequency is between the limits defined by ??. The result is a \n\ncurve of ???? as a function of the radius similar the one generated by equation (14). Since \n\nwe are considering that ????  is independent from the box dimensions, the curve for the \n\npower radiated by the electron is the same as in the free space, described by equation (17). \n\nSo the radius for which ???? inside the box equals ????  is ???. \n\n \n\nFigure 10: Power absorbed ???? for the Bohr radius computed from equation (21), in blue, \n\nand computed from equation (14) (???? =  4.669311 \u00d7 10?8 W/s), in red, and the relative \n\ndeviation between the two curves, in green, as a function of f. The integration was made using the \n\ntrapezoidal method with 107 steps. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n3.4. Equilibrium radius inside a box using the spherical method \n\nAs described in annex 8.1, the Spherical Method enables an easy computational \n\nconstruction of the ZPF [32]. This approximation is however valid only for a large number \n\nof waves, and consequently a great density of waves in the k-space. But when we decrease \n\nthe box volume (V), the density of waves in k-space (??) also decreases, since ?? is related \n\nto the volume by ?? = ?/(2?)\n3 [32]. Moreover, in the spherical method there is only one \n\nwave for each frequency. Then, for the same V and consecutively the same ??, there is a \n\nsmall spacing between adjacent frequencies when compared to the cubic box method \n\ndescribed before. This effect can be easily evaluated by comparison of figures (11) and \n\n(12) \n\nIn figure 11 we can see a plot of several ???? distributions of several k modes for a \n\nspecific ?? and for the Bohr radius. To compute the total ???? for this specific radius, \n\nwe only need to sum all the points according to equation (19). We notice that the random \n\ncharacter of the spherical method10 results in a fluctuation of ????, so to compute ???? \n\nfor each radius we make the average of a set of computations for the same conditions and \n\nradius.  \n\nThe goal is to compute the variation of ???? with the radius in order to find the radius \n\nfor which ???? equals ???? , so first we need to compute ????  for a set of radius using \n\nequation (19). Then we can make a fit of these points in order to search for the interception \n\nof the fitting curve and the ????  theoretical curve. The fitting function should be similar \n\n                                                 \n10 Each k wave is generated with a random direction that in the limit of an infinite number of waves \n\ngenerated yields an isotropic distribution of the waves direction.  \n\n \n\nFigure 11: ???? distributions for 800 waves  generated  in a box of side 1.0514 \u00d7 10?5 ?, \n\nfor the Bohr radius and for f = 20, which corresponds to ? between  4.13413112 \u00d7\n\n1016 ???/?  and 4.134152543 \u00d7 1016 ???/?.  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nto the theoretical function, equation (16), but should allow also some freedom in the \n\nfitting. Therefore, we chose for fitting equation 22, \n\n ???? =  ???  (22) \n\nwhere ? is the independent variable and ? and ? the fitting freedom parameters. In the \n\nlimit of ? ? ? these parameters should take the values ? = ?4.5 and ? =\n  ?5 ?\n\n48 ?3(???0)\n5\n2\n\n=\n\n  2.663522 \u00d7 10?54 (both in SI units), according to equation (16). \n\nHowever, the fitting method (also used in the perfect box method) is subject of some \n\ndiscussion because the points from which we make the fit don\u2019t have a statistical \n\nbehaviour, they are exactly the power absorbed by the electron in a circular orbit with a \n\nspecific radius. We know that the smaller the box is, the sparser will be the frequencies \n\nof the ZPF. In the case of very small boxes, this effect results in some radius for which \n\nthe electron doesn\u2019t absorb energy and in other radius for which the absorbed energy is \n\ncolossal (an example of these differences of the box-???? for adjacent radius are shown \n\nin figure 14), resulting in violent fluctuation in the box-???? curve that is no more the \n\nsmooth curve of figure 8. Therefore, there are a lot of interceptions of this box-???? curve \n\nand the curve of ????  in free space. In other words, there are multiple ??? very close to \n\neach other. However, the force induced on the electron by the random ZPF makes it \n\ntraveling distances larger than the interval between adjacent equilibrium radius. So, we \n\nintuitively expect that in this random motion the box-???? (the one which have violent \n\nfluctuations) will contribute with an average component to the net motion of the electron \n\nfor longer time scales, being the presence of this multi-??? masked. Thus we can compute \n\nan average curve (this one will already be smooth) by fitting some points of the box-???? \n\nand search the intersection (which correspond to an averaged unique ???) of this average \n\ncurve with the ????  in free space.  \n\nThe fitting method for equation (22) is the non-linear least squares. In some cases, \n\nmainly for smaller boxes, there will be points extremely high (for which a resonance wave \n\ncoincides with the radius), so a robust fitting could be more adequate, like the LAR fit \n\nthat will minimize the least absolute residuals.  \n\nThe effect of the ???? fluctuations for adjacent radius could have some periodicity \n\nand the choice of the set of radius could compromise our understanding of the phenomena. \n\nTherefore, to look for this ???? variation as an average behaviour, the radius should be \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nchosen randomly in the interest interval. The number of random radius will be denoted \n\nby rs and the number of generated waves by N. As explained in annex 8.1, for the \n\nspherical method the number of waves and the maximum and minimum frequencies allow \n\nus to compute an estimate of the box volume and, consequently, of the box side (denoted \n\nby L) [32].  \n\nThe spherical method has success to estimate the free space ??? (equal to the Bohr \n\nradius), however for a small cavity the results are questionable. These results and its \n\ndiscussion are presented in annex 8.2. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5. Equilibrium radius inside a box using the Perfect Box Method \n\nSince the previous method seems to be not reliable, we repeated the same simulations \n\nusing the Perfect Box Method. This new method has two major advantages: no need of \n\nmultiple computations of ???? for the same radius since the method doesn\u2019t have a \n\nrandom character in the direction of k-vectors, opposite to the spherical method, and no \n\nneed of estimating the box dimensions from the frequency window and number of waves \n\nsince in this new method the box dimension is an input parameter defined a priori.  \n\nFor big boxes, even between close values of ???? and ????, the number of k-vectors \n\ngenerated for each radius is colossal, so it is necessary to compute and save different files \n\nwith different sets of k-vectors. Then the algorithm that computes ???? for each radius \n\niteratively opens the saved files containing the different sets of k-vectors, computing the \n\nsum of equation (19) for each file and adding always the previous value so that in the end \n\n???? is obtained for that specific radius.  \n\nOnce again, the frequencies generated for each radius are discrete, however \n\ndifferently from the Spherical Method for the same conditions. In the Spherical Method, \n\neach k-vector has a distinct frequency, however in a cubic box there are a lot of k-vectors \n\nwith the same frequency11. This feature is shown in figure 12, where the box size is larger \n\nthan the one used with the Spherical Method (figure 11) and even then, the discreetness \n\nis bigger than in the Spherical Method.  \n\n                                                 \n11 Since ? = ?|?| and, in a cubic 3D mesh in the Cartesian space, there are a lot of points (?-vectors) \nequidistant from the origin. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nOnce again the sum of ???? is computed, using equation (19), for each radius as \n\ndescribed in annex 8.2. Here we apply the Spherical Method. We also use the fitting \n\nmethod of equation (22) in the same way as described in section 3.4. The terminology \n\ndefined before in the Spherical Method has the same meaning.  \n\n???? was computed by this new method for the Bohr radius, using f = 400 and ? =\n\n9 \u00d7 10?5 ?, where we obtained ???? = 4.663982 \u00d7 10?8 ?/?, very similar to the \n\nanalytic value (4.669311 \u00d7 10?8 ?/?) obtained from equation (21). This gives us some \n\npositive feedback about the reliability of this method.  \n\nNow we can estimate ??? for a big box (free space approximation). The power \n\nabsorbed for a set of random radius chosen between 4,97 \u00d7 10?11 and 5,82 \u00d7 10?11 ? \n\nis shown in figure 13. \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Power absorbed ???? for each wave in a box, for the Bohr radius and for f =\n\n100, which corresponds to ???? = 4.13408828 \u00d7 10\n16 ???/? and ???? = 4.13419538 \u00d7\n\n1016 ???/?. The box size is ? = 4 \u00d7 10?5 ?.  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nAs we can see from figure 13, there is an agreement between the computed ???? and \n\nthe theoretical curves. The value of ??? was estimated by the interception between the \n\nfitted curve (robust LAR method) and ???? in free space, yielding ??? = 5.282 \u00d7 10\n?11, \n\nvery close to the Bohr radius ?? (that plot and calculus are not shown in this document). \n\nWe can then conclude that the algorithm and the code are functional and provide accurate \n\nresults, at least for the free space approximation. This validation is important for future \n\nsimulations where a trusty generation of ZPF is required. \n\nWe computed the fitting curve of ???? for smaller boxes. In figure 14 we can see an \n\nexample of ???? as a function of the radius for a small box, together with the theoretical \n\nfree space curve.  \n\nFrom figure 14 we can observe that, opposite to the Spherical Method, no splitting \n\nbehaviour is visible (as shown in annex 8.2). This suggests that the Perfect Box method \n\nis more reliable for small boxes. It is also shown in figure 14 the expected pronounced \n\nscattering. This accentuated difference between ???? for neighbouring radii is originated \n\nby the discreteness of ?. As smaller the box used is, the bigger will be the differences on \n\n???? for neighbouring radii. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13: Computed ???? (blue points) from the Perfect Box method for different random \n\nradius, and theoretical curve (red line) of ???? for the free space, according to equation (16) . \n\nThe computation of ???? was performed for a big box with rs = 10, f = 400 and ? = 8 \u00d7\n\n10?4 ?. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nOnce the fiting of the computed data is made, we can find the intersection between ????  \n\nand the  ???? fitted curve, as in figure 6. The intersection is our estimation of ???. As \n\nexpected, the ??? for the Hydrogen atom in a small box (at least according with our \n\napproximation) is smaller than the value in the free space (??). \n\n \n\nFigure 15: Theoretical curve (black line) of ????  in the free space and fitted curve (Robust \n\nLAR method) for a small box (red line). The computation of the ???? was performed with rs \n\n= 400, f = 400 and ? = 5 \u00d7 10?5 ?. The ??? was found to be 4,265 \u00d7 10\n?11?. \n\n \n\nWe made some computations as in the previous example (where we used ? = 5 \u00d7\n\n10?5 ?) but for different box sizes. The results are presented in figure 16. We made fits \n\nusing the robust LAR method and a non-robust method, however for smaller boxes (L ?\n\n10?3 ?) the non-robust method often produced an extremely low ?2, and sometimes the \n\n \n\nFigure 14: Computed ???? (blue points) using the Perfect Box method for different \n\nrandom radius in a small box, theoretical curve (black line) of ???? for the free space, and fitted \n\ncurve (red line) using the Robust LAR method to the blue points. The computation of ???? was \n\nperformed with rs = 400, f = 400 and ? = 5 \u00d7 10?5 ?. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nsolution did not converge. Thereby we prefer not to pay much attention to the results of \n\nthe non-robust fit. Still in figure 16 we present both fitting methods for each ? value used. \n\nNote that there are points from the robust method in figure 16 that don\u2019t have \n\ncorrespondent result from the non-robust method, for such  L values the fitting curve \n\ndoesn\u2019t intercept the ????  curve. The reason for this failure may be due to the poor fitting \n\nquality of the non-robust method, or the interception point could be outside of the radius \n\nwindow used to generate the computed ???? points. \n\n \n\nAs we initially suggested, the H atom  equilibrium radius seems to decrease as we \n\nsuppress more and more ZPF modes, at least if we consider (as we did) that, in a Casmir \n\ncavity, the radiated power is not changed and the atom radiates as in free space. \n\n3.5.1. Number of absorbed modes \n\nAs the radius of the electron in the H atom decreases, its angular frequency increases, \n\nas from equation (15). So the damping constant (??0\n2) in equation (13) is larger for \n\nsmaller radius, resulting in a broadening of the resonance curve (figure 9) since the \n\nFWHM of a resonance curve of this type is proportional to the damping constant. Thus, \n\naccording to our approximations, an atom will absorb much more energy from the ZPF \n\nmodes for smaller electron radius. As an example, we computed the number of modes \n\n(????? ) transferring energy to the electron in a specific frequency range  (? = 100) for \n\na box with ? = 4 \u00d7 10?5 ?, for two different radii, the Bohr radius (??) and 1.2 ??, \n\nresulting respectively in ????? = 76680 and ????? = 22276. In conclusion, as smaller \n\n \n\nFigure 16: Equilibrium radius ??? of the H atom for different box sizes (?). The red squares \n\nand blue circles represent ??? computed using the robust method and the non-robust method \n\nfittings, respectively. Some computations with the non-robust fitting didn\u2019t produce a result, \n\nthus some red squares don\u2019t have the corresponding blue circle. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nthe electron radius is, the larger will be the number of different ZPF modes transferring \n\nenergy to the electron. \n\nNow we can evaluate how ?????  changes with the box size. We made the same \n\ncalculations for two boxes sizes, ? = 4 \u00d7 10?5 ? and ? =  3 \u00d7 10?5 ?. As expected, \n\n?????  decreases from the bigger box to the smaller one (since the small box has fewer \n\nmodes), either for the small orbit or for the larger orbit. However, for ? = 1,2 \u00d7 ?? the \n\ndecrease in ?????  was 64 %, while for ? = ?? the decrease was 57 %. This allows us to \n\nconclude that a difference in the box size induces a larger perturbation to larger radius \n\norbits than to smaller radius orbits. So, inside a cavity, larger shifts are expected for higher \n\nprincipal quantum number (n), considering the H atom described by the Bohr model. \n\n3.5.2. An energetic evaluation \n\nAs we are working in the realm of classic mechanics, we will evaluate the energy \n\nfrom that point of view. To compute the energy of the ground state in free space of the \n\nHydrogen atom, we use simple mechanics such as the Newton\u2019s second law, to describe \n\nthe electron motion. Thus, the centripetal force (?? ) acting in the electron is given by \n\nequation (23) [39]. \n\n \n?? =\n\n??2\n\n?\n=\n\n?2\n\n4??0?\n2\n (23) \n\nThe kinetic energy of the electron is given by equation (24). \n\n \n? =\n\n??2\n\n2\n=\n\n?2\n\n8??0?\n (24) \n\nFinally, knowing the potential energy (U) of the electron in the Coulomb potential, \n\nwe can sum the electron kinetic and potential energies and compute the total energy (E) \n\nfor the Bohr radius, given by equation (25) [39]. \n\n \n? = ? + ? =\n\n?2\n\n8??0?\n?  \n\n?2\n\n4??0?\n= ?\n\n?2\n\n8??0?\n= ?13.6 ?? (25) \n\nAssuming that equation (25) is applicable to a H atom in a reflective box, we \n\ncomputed the energy difference between the ground state of the H atom in the free space \n\nand in a reflective box. As an example, we will use ??? obtained for a box with ? = 5 \u00d7\n\n10?5 ?, as the one of figure 6. For this radius value, the ground state energy is \n\n?14.4584 ??, and the expected shift relative to the free space is 0.86 ??. \n\nWe conclude that there is an energy shift in the ground state of the H atom when it is \n\ninside a cubic box of perfectly reflective walls. However, this attempt to estimate the shift \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nof ??? for the H atom inside a cavity was made according with some important \n\nconsiderations, from which we highlight: \n\n? The H atom is described by two harmonic oscillators in quadrature only valid \n\nfor circular orbits. \n\n? The radiated power rate is not affected by the boundary conditions imposed \n\nby the Casimir cavity. \n\n? It is valid to use a robust fitting of equation (22) in the computed ???? to \n\npredict the average ???? of an electron in a random motion induced by the \n\nZPF. \n\n3.6. Three-dimensional electron motion in the H atom  \n\nAs an attempt to improve our previous work and the works performed by others \n\n[35][36], we developed a full three-dimensional model of the H atom in the SED \n\nframework. We implemented here the basic ideas and algorithm used in the previous \n\nsimulations, described in section 2.2, and included some modifications discussed below. \n\nAccording to our model, the electron can move in all directions, with no fixed plane \n\nrestriction. The ZPF in our model is also fully generated in 3D, the k-vectors being \n\ndistributed in a perfect cubic mesh according to the SED requirements in the case of a \n\ncubic cavity. This ZPF can be generated using the perfect box method described in section \n\n3.1. Other innovation of this model is the inclusion of the magnetic part of the ZPF and \n\nits influence in the electron orbit, which may cause new features never seen before.  \n\nBesides that, this new model has a smaller number of approximations than the \n\nmethods previously described.  Still, we had to make some approximations. For example, \n\nthe computational impossibility of generating an infinite number of waves forced us to \n\ngenerated only the waves resonating with all the radii between two limits, ???? and ????. \n\nSince we are running the code in a personal computer, which limits the computation time, \n\nwe were forced to use again a window approximation. The frequency window (??) was \n\nhowever differently computed in comparison with the previous work. At this time, we \n\nmade ?? = ???0\n2, where ? is the proportionality constant and ?0 is the electron \n\ninstantaneous angular frequency computed from its radius for a circular orbit, as from \n\nequation (15). ? is the same damping constant used in the harmonic damping oscillator \n\ndescribed in section 3.2 by equation (12). ?? here defined, contrarily to ?? defined in \n\n2.2.2, preserves the real resonance behaviour of the energy absorbed by the electron from \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nthe ZPF. ?? was calculated assuming only circular orbits, however we also deduced ?? \n\nbased in the real damping constant of the differential equation (2). Nevertheless, our tests \n\ndemonstrated that the difference in ?? was minimal, so we maintain the circular orbit \n\napproximation for the ?? computation. An example of a 3D plot of the electron position \n\nvariation with time is shown in figure 17. \n\nAlthough this method is more realistic, it is also computationally heavier. For big \n\ncavities, the code was almost impossible to run (in a personal computer) since the number \n\nof ZPF waves is huge. For small boxes (? below a few microns), the code was possible \n\nto run according with our computational limitations, however taking a lot of time.  \n\nOur goal was first to have a coherent result (the electron radius distribution for the H \n\natom similar to the one predicted by the Schrodinger equation) for the free space, \n\nvalidating this code. Next, we would like to compute the electron radius distribution \n\ninside cavities and estimate the ground state shift for different cavities. However, the \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17: Plots of the electron motion behaviour simulated with our method. In this case \n\nthe cavity was a cube of side = 200 nm, the simulated electron motion time was 7.1928 \u00d7\n\n10?12?.

Each blue point \n\nrepresents the electron position at each 6 \u00d7 10?17?. b) Electron orbit radius as a function of \n\ntime.  \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nenormous computational resources required by our model made impossible to run the \n\ncode for the free space, and also impossible to accumulate enough statistics. Even so, our \n\n8 simulations in small cavities have in common the tendency for the electron to be at a \n\nradius shorter than the Bohr radius for most of the simulation time. This seems to suggest \n\nthat there is a shift induced by the small cavity.  \n\nIn a time scale in the order of 10?12?,  we observed only a small deviation from the \n\nelectron initial orbit plane. However, we believe that for longer time scales the position \n\ndistribution would be aspheric like in the QM case. \n\nWe also evaluated the influence of the chosen ?? in the electron behaviour. For this \n\npurpose, we used our model for three different frequency windows ??. The \n\ncorresponding plots of the electron radius as a function of time are shown in figure 18.  \n\nAs we can see, ?? seems to play an important role since the fluctuation amplitude in \n\nthe radius seems to increase as ? is increased. Even ?? being thousands of times greater \n\nthan the FWHM of the absorbed power resonance curve, the waves beyond the electron \n\nresonance frequency seem to have an important influence on the electron behaviour. This \n\nobservation made us rethink the ?? utilization. We demonstrated (in section 3.3) that the \n\nwaves with frequencies away from the resonance frequency do not have a significant \n\ninfluence on the total power absorbed by the electron, at least for the classic harmonic \n\noscillator. However, with this new approach, we suggest not using the window \n\napproximation in the future or using a wider window. Yet, it is possible that this strong \n\ninfluence of ?? is only present for small cavities. This hypothesis arises from the fact \n\nthat, in small cavities, the density of ZPF modes is lower, so near the resonance frequency \n\n \n\nFigure 18: Plots of the electron orbit radius as a function of time, generated by our \n\nalgorithm. The simulation was performed for ? = 1300 \u00d7 10?9 ?, ???? = 2 \u00d7 10\n?11 ? and \n\n???? = 40 \u00d7 10\n?11 ? . Three frequency windows ?? were used, corresponding to: a) ? =\n\n5 \u00d7 102; b) ? = 5 \u00d7 103; c) ? = 5 \u00d7 104. \n\na) b) c) \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nthere are only a few modes, whose influence is too small so that the influence of the \n\nfarther modes begins to be more important. \n\n3.7. Concluding remarks \n\nIn the present work we don\u2019t consider the influence of the cavity on the atom radiated \n\npower. However, it is possible that the reflective walls of the cavity will reflect the emitted \n\nwaves which may interfere with their self and also with the orbiting electron. The \n\nsimulations we have made so far are valid for systems immersed in a modified ZPF. \n\nHowever, they may not be valid for a cavity since we don\u2019t take into account the \n\nperturbations in the radiation emitted that is induced by the cavity. The paper of ref. [37] \n\nstudied the spontaneous emission of the harmonic oscillator inside cavities in the SED \n\nrealm. The paper suggests that the radiation damping term, ??0\n2 in equation (13), is \n\naffected by the reflective cavity walls. This conclusion was deduced for a harmonic \n\noscillator inside two parallel conductor plates resulting in two modified damping \n\nconstants, one for the perpendicular orientation between the oscillator and the plates and \n\nthe other for the parallel orientation. It was also suggested that, taking into account the \n\nmodifications induced in the damping term and in the ZPF, the ground state harmonic \n\noscillator between two mirrors would preserve its free-space energy. However, excited \n\nstates would acquire different cavity-induced properties. It is even affirmed: \u201cIf the atom \n\nstays for a long time inside the cavity some states are \"eliminated\" because they become \n\nmore unstable, while other states acquire the status of \"stable states\".\u201d. This supports our \n\nhypothesis (better explained in the following chapter) of radiative shifts between the \n\nground and modified exited states. \n\nBoth methods used by us (discussed in sections 2.2 and 3.6), in addition to not taking \n\ninto account the waves reflected back from the cavity walls, have shown some instability \n\nproblems, mainly the ones discussed in section 2.2.3. Therefore, as suggested in 2.2.3, \n\nsomething else could be necessary to achieve the atom stability, for example to account \n\nfor the inner structure of the particles as suggested in ref. [28]. This inner structure will \n\nallow storing energy in the freedom degrees of this subatomic structure. The stored energy \n\nis dynamically exchanged between the electron and the inner structure, leading to a feed-\n\nback mechanism capable of maintaining the atomic stability. We are also working in \n\ncollaboration with Rodr\u00edguez (author of ref. [28]) to adapt our algorithm in order to \n\naccomplish this substructure. However no relevant results were achieved so far. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n4. Method to extract energy from ZPF \n\nAt this stage the reader could still be a little sceptical about the idea of extracting \n\nenergy from the vacuum. \u201cIf the vacuum is the lower state found in the universe how is it \n\npossible to extract energy from it?\u201d However, as the reader should already understand, \n\nthe vacuum is not all the same, and it\u2019s possible to create a region in the space where the \n\nvacuum energy is lower than in the free space. This region could be a Casimir cavity, \n\nwhere some electromagnetic modes are vanished. From general physics it is known that, \n\nin order to have an energy flow, there must be an unbalance between two regions, and \n\nthus the energy can flow from the most to the least energetic region. Even so, most of the \n\ntimes it is needed to provide some kind of circuit for the energy to flow. For example, if \n\nwe place a Casimir cavity in the space, nothing will happen because the excess of modes \n\nin the outside does not flow to the inside as they are not allowed there. We need a \n\nmechanism to transport the outside energy to the inside. This mechanism must in \n\nequilibrium with the vacuum outside, exchanging energy with it continuously. If we pull \n\nthis mechanism inside it will drag some of the outside energy. However, inside the \n\nCasimir cavity, the equilibrium with the inside vacuum is no longer present and \n\nconsequently the excess of energy will be released and the equilibrium with the medium \n\nwill be restored. Finally, in the energy releasing process, the energy will be transmuted in \n\na form that could be distinguishable of the ZPF and then collected and used by our \n\napparatus. \n\nIn this chapter, we start by presenting the basic concept to measure the atomic energy \n\nshift induced by a Casimir cavity and review the state of the art, describing a method \n\navailable in the literature. We then consider new improvements to the method, and finish \n\nwith some considerations needed to apply the initial concept to an experiment in the real \n\nword. \n\n4.1. The Proposed Method  \n\n4.1.1. Earlier work \n\nRecently (2012), a paper by Dmitriyeva and Moddel [8] reports an experimental work \n\nwhere different gases are passed through Casimir cavities and the emitted radiation is \n\ncollected. To simulate the Casimir cavities, they used nano-porous membranes (Whatman \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\npolycarbonate Nuclepore track-etched flexible membranes with pore sizes of 0.1, 0.2, and \n\n0.4 ?m) coated with gold by thermal evaporation. These membranes were mounted in a \n\nstainless-steel vacuum system where a wide bandwidth SPH-49 pyroelectric detector \n\nfrom Spectrum Detectors Inc. was used for the radiative output measurements. This \n\ndetector has a sensitivity of 1,9 \u00d7 104 ?/?  almost constant in the wavelength range \n\nfrom 0.6 to 5 ?m, so mostly in the infrared (IR) region. The flow was also modulated (at \n\n0.5 Hz) by closing and opening a valve connected to a mechanical vacuum pump. The \n\npressure inside the chamber was kept in the range 1-10 torr. Different gases (Ar, Xe, He \n\nand N2) were used with gold-coated and uncoated membranes, with the flow rate also \n\nchanged. Data have shown that, as the flow rate increases, the radiation collected also \n\nincreases, as expected. However, more radiation emitted was expected to be observed for \n\nthe coated membranes12 and these experiments revealed more radiation intensity for the \n\nuncoated membranes. The authors expected more radiation to be emitted for heavier \n\natoms (such as Xe) since the valence electrons have more external orbits and consequently \n\ntheir orbit frequencies should be lower, and  so inside the cavities the modes closer to the \n\nresonant frequencies of these orbits are more suppressed relative to the case of lighter \n\natoms, as discussed in section 3.5.1. Nevertheless, and contrary to expectations, the \n\nexperimental results obtained in [8] have shown that more radiation was emitted for \n\nlighter atoms.  \n\n4.1.2. Improvements to the earlier work \n\nThe present work can be seen as an attempt to continue and improve the study \n\npresented by Dmitriyeva and Moddel [8]. In this section, we will point out some possible \n\nproblems present in the earlier work and propose some modifications:  \n\n \n\n1. First of all, as discussed in ref. [8], the main problem was the impossibility to \n\nseparate the background from the hypothetical radiation emission caused by the \n\nground state shift of the atoms. A variety of possible physical effects may origin \n\nemission of radiation in the infrared region at room temperature. In this way, we \n\npropose to make a spectroscopic study of the radiation emitted. If all the cavities \n\nhave the same diameter, the ZPF inside the cavities will be equal (the same \n\nsuppressed modes), then we would expect the shift in the ground state to be roughly \n\n                                                 \n12 The metal coated membranes constitute a better approximation to the Casimir condition.  However, \n\nLifshitz has shown that the fundamental effect exists also for any dielectric materials [25]. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nthe same, and for the same gas and membrane we would observe in a spectroscopic \n\nanalysis a Gaussian distribution with centroid in the wavelength corresponding to \n\nthe energy shift characteristic of this specific atom and cavity diameter13. \n\n2. Second, if necessary we can try to use membranes with pores of smaller diameter \n\nto increase the energy shift of the ground state and so decrease the emitted light \n\nwavelength towards the visible or UV region, making it easier to distinguish this \n\nradiation from the background.  \n\n3. Another improvement that should increase the irradiated energy is the use of excited \n\nstates instead of ground states. In the classical realm, the excited electrons travel in \n\nthe outermost orbits, corresponding to lower angular frequencies. So the same \n\ncavity could induce a bigger shift for excited-state electrons than for ground-state \n\nelectrons. We expect this behaviour because inside a cavity there is a smaller \n\nnumber of modes near the orbital frequency for an excited-state atom. This \n\nhypothesis is sustained by the study made in section 3.5.1. \n\n4. It is possible that the radiation correspondent to the ground state shift is also a \n\nforbidden mode inside the cavity. So if the atom cannot radiate, it could persist in \n\nthe energy level of the ground state outside the cavity, which would correspond to \n\nan excited (of infinite lifetime) state inside the cavity. To solve this failure we \n\npropose a more complex method. We need then to give to the system some energy \n\nso that the system will release the supplied energy plus the shift. A more detailed \n\nexplanation of this method is presented in section 4.1.3. \n\n4.1.3. Discussion of the two possible scenarios for the level shift mechanism \n\nIf our main hypothesis of the atoms undergoing an energy level shift (in the ground \n\nor excited state) inside Casimir cavities is correct, then a crucial question persists: Is this \n\nshift instantaneous (progressive in a small time scale) or will the atom remain in an \n\nexcited state until it decays by some mechanism (such as spontaneous emission)? This \n\nquestion influences the experiment that we will carry out and we consider here two \n\ndifferent options: \n\n1. The ground state of the atom in the free space can behave as an excited state inside \n\nthe cavity, thus it would keep the outside ground state for a period of time and \n\n                                                 \n13 However, here we discriminate the wall-atom interaction. Since the Casimir-Polder and van der Waals \n\ninteractions also induce energy shifts and these shifts have a great dependence on the wall distance, a \n\nnarrower spectrum can be observed from the radiation emitted from atoms at different distances to the \n\nwalls. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nonly then decay to the cavity ground state (similar to the spontaneous emission). \n\nIn Ref. [8] it is suggested that the ground state atoms could enter the porous cavity \n\nand undergo a level shift to the cavity ground state only when they interact with \n\nthe walls. This applies also to the excited states, so when the atom in an excited \n\nstate enters the cavity, it decays by spontaneous emission, from the outside excited \n\nstate to the cavity ground state, emitting radiation with energy equal to the ground \n\nstate shift plus the energy of the excited state in the free space transition. \n\n2. If we look close to the SED theory, and consider an electron in a planetary-like \n\norbit, in the absence of resonant ZPF modes it will decay in spiral as a \n\nconsequence of the Abraham\u2013Lorentz force, releasing radiation according to its \n\ninstantaneous radius. This argument leads us to think that a change in the atomic \n\nlevel will be progressive when the resonant modes disappear, still it will look like \n\nan instantaneous reaction14. This applies to both ground and excited states. Then, \n\nif an atom in an existing state enters the cavity, its excited state undergoes a shift \n\nand, when the atom decays by spontaneous emission to the cavity ground state, it \n\nwill emit radiation with energy equal to the difference between the cavity excited \n\nstate and the cavity ground state. This energy will be smaller than the \n\ncorrespondent free space transition, since the energy shift of the excited level is \n\nhigher than the energy shift of the ground state. \n\n4.1.4. Our concept to extract energy from the ZPF \n\nThe first and the simplest experimental study we suggest is to pass atoms in the \n\nground state through Casimir cavities and to analyse the radiation emitted. We propose \n\nto make a spectroscopic analysis for a fixed cavity size to test the hypothesis that the \n\nspectroscopic emission has a specific pattern resulting from the constant ground state \n\nshift. To compare and subtract the background, we should study the effect without \n\ncavities, with non-coated cavities and with metal-coated cavities. This spectroscopic \n\nanalysis could be done in the IR region, however the problems described in 4.1.3 could \n\ninterfere. So a spectral analysis in the visible and ultra-violet (UV) regions for different \n\ncavity sizes will be preferential. In our experiment, we intend to make a UV-visible \n\nanalysis (160 to 550 nm) of monoatomic and polyatomic gases passing through \n\naluminium coated porous membranes (0.4, 0.1 and 0.05 ?m).  \n\n                                                 \n14 If we remove the ZPF of an electron in the H atom at the Bohr radius, it takes approximately 1.2 \u00d7\n10?11 ? to reach the nucleus, so we consider these decays as instantaneous. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nAccording to classic mechanics, an electron in an excited state (where we consider \n\nplanetary-like orbits) has a bigger orbit, and so a lower angular frequency relative to its \n\nground state. Thus, for the same cavity, we expect a larger shift in the excited state than \n\nin the ground state, since there are more suppressed modes near the resonant frequency \n\nin the case of the bigger orbit as demonstrated in section 3.5.1. Hence there will be a \n\nnegative shift in the transition energy. \n\nFor each of the two possible decay channels suggested in section 4.1.3, we propose \n\na different method to extract the energy from the vacuum.  \n\nFor hypothesis 1, the atom is first excited to a resonance state, then goes inside a \n\nCasimir cavity in such a way that it decays there by spontaneous emission. As we expect \n\nthe final state to be the shifted ground state, the energy of the radiation released would be \n\nthe free space resonance transition energy plus the energy difference between the outside \n\nground state and the cavity ground state. Once the atom goes out the cavity the ZPF \n\nreenergises the cavity ground state back again to the outside ground state. An \n\nexemplifying scheme of the concept is presented in figure 19. An important aspect in this \n\nscenario has to be taken into account, the spontaneous emission rate inside a Casimir \n\ncavity, or close to a reflective wall, is modified. This interesting behaviour related with \n\nthe van der Waals and Casimir-Polder forces was predicted by QED [25] and SED [37], \n\nand was also observed experimentally [41]. An excited state can acquire a lifetime 20 \n\ntimes longer than the lifetime in the free space [37], so the atoms will need to stay longer \n\ninside the cavity to decay. There is also a hypothesis that the outside excited state decays \n\nto the cavity excited state by spontaneous emission, releasing an energy equal to the \n\nenergy difference between the states. This emitted radiation would be much less \n\nenergetic, so harder to detect. \n\nFor hypothesis 2, where we consider the decay to be instantaneous, the atom goes \n\ninside the cavity, where its ground and excited states undergo an energy shift, the excited \n\nstate shift being larger than the ground state shift. Then we can excite a specific state \n\ninside the cavity with a small amount of energy relative to the energy needed in the free \n\nspace. Once excited, the atom goes out the cavity and the ground and the excited states \n\nundergo again an energetic shift. When the atom decays by spontaneous emission in the \n\nfree space, it releases an amount of energy larger than the one used to excite it. When the \n\natom enters the cavity, it radiates the energy difference between the shifts, either if it \n\nenters in the ground state or in the excited state. Figure 20 exemplifies this process. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn any of these two cases, we observe a gain of energy between the energy provided \n\nand the one released, the ZPF being the source of the excess energy. \n\nAnother interesting method related to the one proposed by Puthoff [29], and \n\naddressed in section 1.3, is based on the ionization and molecular dissociation energy \n\nshift. According to SED (at least with the approximation made in the present work), an \n\n \n\nFigure 19: A two-level atom in the free space has a characteristic transition energy ???. Inside \n\nthe cavity, the ground state undergoes an energy shift from ?? to ???, releasing by spontaneous \n\nemission an energy ??? greater that ???. Again in the free space, the ZPF reenergises ??? \n\nback again to ??. Considering the hypothesis of the transition between the excited states outside \n\nand inside the cavity, the energy released will be ?? ? ???. \n\n \n\nFigure 20: A two-level atom in the free space has a characteristic transition energy ??1. If \n\nwe irradiate the atom with an energy ??0 lower than ??1, the atom is not excited and remains \n\nin the ground state. However, inside the cavity, the ground and excited states undergo an energy \n\nshift from ?0 to ?0? and from ?1 to ?1?, respectively. Thus it is possible to excite the atom with \n\n??0. When the atom goes outside the cavity, the ZPF reenergises both the excited and ground \n\nstates, and by spontaneous emission the atom releases an energy ??1 greater than ??0. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\natom in the ground state (or in an excited state) should have ionization energy larger inside \n\na cavity than in the free space. So the idea would be to first ionize the atom and then, \n\nwhen it goes inside the cavity and captures a free electron, it would emit an amount of \n\nenergy larger than the one used to ionize it in the beginning. \n\nThe use of molecules instead of single atoms would be maybe more accessible \n\nexperimentally. If the molecules in the ground state were inside the cavity, where the \n\nvibrational resonant modes are suppressed (all or some of them), we would expect that \n\nthe molecule dissociation energy would be greater than in free space. Thus we could \n\ndissociate the molecules before they enter the cavity and, once inside, if they recombine \n\nthey could emit radiation more energetic than the one used to dissociate it in the \n\nbeginning.  \n\n4.2. Considerations for the implementation in the real world \n\nUntil now, we made a series of proposals and estimations, but unfortunately they are, \n\ntogether with the computations of the energy shifts for the H atom performed in chapter \n\n3, difficult to transpose to the real world. The reader should understand that we are \n\nworking somewhat blind, since SED is still a very immature theory. In the literature, the \n\nworks in this area are scarce and the few that exist are essentially conceptual and don\u2019t \n\nhave in consideration the limitations imposed by the materials or the instrumentation \n\nproperties. Hence in this section we try to point out some facts that could influence our \n\ntheoretical assumptions.  \n\nIn chapters 2 and 3, we have studied the H atom, which is the simplest case. The \n\nheavier atoms have more electrons, thus one more term to account, the Coulomb force \n\nbetween the electrons. Consequently, the orbits will be more complex, with the possible \n\narising of very exotic geometries, like in the case of the orbitals predicted by QM (orbitals \n\np, d, f, etc.). Furthermore, the model discussed here does not take into account the electron \n\nspin (as in the SEDS case), which could change our actual scenario. \n\n4.2.1. Reflectance of Casimir cavity walls  \n\nMetals are not perfectly reflective to the electromagnetic radiation and the reflectance \n\nis also dependent on the angle of the incidence and on the wavelength [42]. The \n\npenetration depth15 is an important parameter and also varies with frequency, being \n\n                                                 \n15 Depth in a material for which the intensity of an incident wave decays to 1/e of its original value [42]. \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\naround 20 nm for an incident wave of wavelength 200 nm, for typical metals [42]. These \n\nparameters will influence our theoretical model, where we considered a perfectly \n\nreflective cavity. \n\nThe Casimir condition (a small cavity with perfectly conductive walls) is hard to \n\naccomplish in the real world, still we should try to make the best approximation.  \n\nIn typical metals, if we treat the electrons as free particles, they will move according \n\nto the frequency of the incoming electromagnetic wave and then this wave will be \n\nreflected. However, above the metal plasma frequency, the electrons cannot move quickly \n\nenough to reflect this incoming wave [42]. So the metals are not good reflectors for higher \n\nfrequencies, which could propagate inside a cavity even if its size is small enough to \n\nsuppress them. Thus, even if we continue decreasing the cavity size, the metal reflectivity \n\nwill impose a limit (related to the metal plasma frequency) on the perturbation caused by \n\nthe ZPF.  \n\nIn order to suppress the largest amount of normal modes inside the cavity we should \n\nuse for the Casimir cavity wall a highly reflective metal whose reflectance extends to \n\nhigher frequencies. The reflectance as a function of the incident radiation wavelength for \n\nvarious films made of gold, silver, aluminium, copper, rhodium and titanium is presented \n\nin figure 21. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21: Reflectance of films of gold (Au), silver (Ag), aluminium (Al), copper \n\n(Cu), rhodium (Rh) and titanium (Ti) as a function of the incident radiation wavelength \n\n[43]. \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\nAluminium is the best choice for the cavity wall since it is the most reflective metal \n\nin the UV region16. Gold is often used in Casimir experiments (for example refs. [18] \n\n[19]) since it has a high reflectance, almost 100%, but only for lower frequencies. As \n\nthese experiments made studies with walls of thicknesses in the ?m range, which suppress \n\nonly the wavelengths longer than the ones in the IR region, the gold coating was a good \n\noption. However, for the nanometre scale that we intend to explore in this work, Al is the \n\nmost suitable choice.  \n\n4.2.2. Geometry and orientation issues \n\nThe computer simulations of chapter 3 were performed for cubic cavities. However \n\nit is more practical to pass gas atoms through a structure with a small aperture or by a \n\nnarrow tube. In these cases, the ZPF is only perturbed for the modes that travel in \n\ndirections orthogonal to the walls. In this way, the influence in the average atomic orbit \n\nwill depend on the orbit orientation. As we have seen in section 3.6, the deviation of an \n\nelectron from the initial motion plane is almost negligible, at least in the time scale \n\ninvestigated. So, if we consider its orbit restricted to a fixed plane, the atom self-rotation \n\nwill define the orbit orientation.  \n\nAn atom in random linear and rotational motions, as in a gas molecular flow, will be \n\naffected by the ZPF perturbations according to its instantaneous orientation. This scenario \n\nis hard to predict; however, we expect that there will be an observable average energy \n\nlevel shift even inside a narrow Casimir tube, instead of a box. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 In addition to figure 21, the Aluminium reflectance is approximately constant down to ~80 ??,  where \nit drops abruptly. Other metals such as Copper, Platinum, Chromium, Silver and Gold already have a \n\nreflectance lower than 20% at ~90 ??. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n5. Experimental apparatus \n\nIn this chapter we start by describing the basic concept of our experiment and then \n\nwe give technical information about each component of our system and about the data \n\nacquisition instrumentation. \n\n5.1. General Description \n\nIn section 4.1 we suggested and described some methods for extraction of energy \n\nfrom the ZPF. Now we propose an experimental apparatus to implement some of these \n\nmethods.  \n\nThe main idea of the methods proposed is interchanging atoms between the free space \n\nand a Casimir cavity. To materialise this concept, we flow gases (monoatomic and \n\nmolecular) through a nano-porous membrane coated with aluminium. Since we are using \n\ngases, to reach an appropriate level of purity we designed and built a vacuum stainless \n\nsteel system. Besides providing the necessary vacuum, this system allows the gas flow \n\nthrough the porous membrane. To analyse the spectrum of the radiation emitted we use a \n\nmonochromator coupled to a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT). For the tests where we need \n\nto radiate a specific wavelength, we use another monochromator coupled to a lamp that \n\nemits in a continuous spectrum. This apparatus allow us to study almost all the hypotheses \n\nproposed in section 4.1.4. Figure 22 shows a simple schematic of our apparatus. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n5.1.1. The nano-porous membranes \n\nA Casimir cavity is a region in space where some of the ZPF modes are suppressed. \n\nModifying the ZPF is trivial, in fact all the matter induces local perturbations on the ZPF, \n\nhowever between two conductive and neutral walls the perturbation in the ZPF is greater, \n\nmainly for the ZPF waves that propagate orthogonally to the walls. Pores with a \n\ncylindrical form are even better than a pair of walls, since they suppress the modes that \n\npropagate in two perpendicular directions. Hence, the use of a membrane with numerous \n\nholes whose internal walls are coated with a metallic layer could be a good choice.  \n\nWe used in our experiment Nuclepore Track-Etched Polycarbonate membranes from \n\nWhatman (supplied by GE Healthcare Life Sciences). These membranes, mostly used as \n\nfilters for fluids, have discrete pores sharply defined, high flow rates, and excellent \n\nchemical and thermal resistances. They are fabricated from a thin film of polycarbonate \n\nthrough a combination of charged particle bombardment (or irradiation) and chemical \n\netching. They have a thickness of only 7 to 20 ?m but burst strength larger than 10 psi \n\n(0,69 bar), which is more than enough for our applied differential pressure. The maximum \n\noperation temperature is 140 \u00baC, which allows for thermal evaporation without \n\n \n\nFigure 22: Simplistic schematic of our experimental apparatus. The black lines represent \n\nthe main chamber where the gases are circulated. The blue rectangles represent optical \n\ninterfaces. Two MgF2 windows, 3 mm thick, were used between the main chamber and the \n\nmonochromators . ?0 is the central frequency at the output of Monochromator 2 and ??  \n\nrepresents the frequencies of the radiation emitted by the atoms which undergo a cavity-induced \n\nlevel shift, which can have origin inside the cavities or at the exit.  \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\ndeformation risk. Its porosity (void volume) lies in the 4-20% range, and the pore density \n\nlies in the range of 105 up to 6 \u00d7 108 pores cm2? . \n\nWe got three different types of membranes, with pore diameters of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.4 \n\n?m. We assembled them in copper supports using a low outgassing epoxy glue to prevent \n\nany gas flow other than the one flowing through the pores. In figure 23 we can see a \n\npicture of a membrane glued to the copper holder.  \n\nThe process used to coat the membranes is thermal evaporation with aluminium. To \n\ncoat the maximum depth into the pores we made four evaporations, placing the membrane \n\nin four different angles of 45\u00ba. The faces of these membranes are slight different, one is \n\nperfectly planar and the other is rougher, and we coated only the planar face. \n\n \n\nTo verify the existence of nano-pores,  to confirm its size, uniformity and density, \n\nwe analysed a membrane of pores with 100 nm diameters with a scanning electron \n\nmicroscope (SEM). The results are shown in figure 24. \n\nAs expected, the membrane has well distributed pores with a large density, and their \n\nsizes are according to the specifications. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 23: Uncoated membrane glued onto a copper support which is itself mounted on a \n\nvacuum system piece (center-ring support KF-25).  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n5.1.2. Monochromators \n\nTo irradiate the main chamber and to analyse the radiation emitted two \n\nmonochromators (MC) were used, both of them from ACTON ARC, Model VM-502.  \n\nThey are nominal 0.2 meter evacuable monochromators with an optimum wavelength \n\nrange in the vacuum ultraviolet region. The grating mounted in both the MCs is a standard \n\n1200 G/mm, which allows a wavelength range 30 - 546 nm (approximated values). The \n\nfocal length is 0.2 meters, the aperture ratio f/4.5 and the grating coating is made of \n\nAluminium and MgF2. \n\nOne MC (from now on named MC1) was used as spectrum analyser and its step-\n\nmotor controlled by the ACTON SpectraDriver-SD3. This controlling device allows the \n\nMC operation to be controlled by software, which is very practical. The other MC (named \n\nMC2) was used to irradiate the membrane and is controlled by the ACTON SpectraDrive-\n\nSD, equipped with a display and a keypad allowing the MC operation. Both the \n\ncontrollers allow specifying the scanning rate and the wavelength range. \n\nIt is recommended by the manufacturer that for spectroscopy in the VUV region (less \n\nthan 200 nm wavelengths) the MC should be evacuated at least down to a pressure of \n\n6.7 \u00d7 10?4 mbar. \n\nThe light entrance and exit flanges of the MCs have slits, vertical (internally \n\nadjustable) and horizontal (adjustable outside by a micrometre scaled knob). The \n\n \n\nFigure 24: SEM photos from a membrane of pores with diameter = 100 nm. The \n\nplanar face of the membrane, coated with 40 nm of palladium, is shown. The right \n\nphoto was taken with a magnification of 20000\u00d7 and the left photo with a magnification \n\nof 100000\u00d7.  \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nhorizontal slits have the important task of controlling the MC resolution. The narrower \n\nthis slit is the better will be the MC resolution. However the light intensity is also smaller \n\nand for our purposes it may be necessary to maximize the light collected or emitted. Thus \n\nwe needed to find the best compromise between the light collection/emission and the \n\nresolution required. The entrance and the exit slits have influence on the resolution, and \n\nthe best compromise was found to be when they are the two equally open. So, whatever \n\nthe required resolution is, the entrance and the exit slits must have the same gap, this is \n\ntrue for both the horizontal and vertical slits. Although less significant, the vertical slits \n\nalso influence the MC resolution. Preliminary tests with our system have shown that the \n\nbetter compromise for the vertical slits is achieved for MC1 and MC2 entrance and exit \n\nslits with 2 ??.  \n\n5.1.3. The gaseous chamber and the vacuum system \n\nThe main chamber, where the membrane is mounted, is made of stainless steel and \n\nis composed of three parts. Two of them are symmetric in order to adapt to the \n\nentrance/exit of the MCs. Each of these pieces was designed by us (using Autodesk \n\nInventor software) and is formed by a flange (that couples to the MC) soldered to a KF25 \n\ntube with the respective flange in the opposite side.  \n\nThe KF25 tubes were made the shortest possible (~35 ??) in order to minimise the \n\nmembrane-MC distance and therefore maximize the solid angle. The flanges that couple \n\nto the MC have an opening (26 ?? diameter) that allows the light to pass through. In \n\norder to hermetically isolate the MC from the chamber, we used an MgF2 window sealed \n\nwith two Viton o-rings placed between each MC and the chamber. We chose this material \n\n(MgF2) because it has a transparency above 80% for wavelengths down to 160 nm, where \n\nit starts to slightly decrease, reaching 60% at 120 nm.  To each of the symmetric pieces \n\nthat compose the chamber we soldered a Swagelok flange (VCR \u00bc inch) that will couple \n\nto the vacuum and the gas flow system. The third piece of the main chamber is a bellows \n\nor flexible coupling tube (minimum length ~5 ??), which helps the assembling and \n\nalignment between the two MCs. The bellows is connected between the other two pieces \n\nby centring-rings. The membrane, assembled in the KF25 centring-rings shown in figure \n\n26, is pressed between the flexible coupling tube and the KF25 flange of one of symmetric \n\npieces (the one closer to MC1). A schematic representation of our system is shown in \n\nfigure 26 and a photo of the system is shown in figure 25. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25: Photo of part of our experimental system, showing the two MCs, the main \n\nchamber, part of the data acquisition instrumentation and part of the vacuum system. The \n\nvacuum gauges and pumps are not visible. \n\n  \n\nFigure 26: Scheme of the vacuum and gas flow system. In grey, the main chamber is shown \n\n(composed by the two symmetric parts and the bellows described before), while the orange \n\nboxes are the monochromators MC1 and MC2. In blue, we show the vacuum equipment and \n\nthe black lines are vacuum tubes. The distance between the two MCs is 14 cm. The distances \n\nfrom the membrane to MC1 and MC2 are respectively4.5 and 9.5 cm.  \n\nMembrane \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nThe vacuum system is composed by two turbo-molecular vacuum pumps (T1 and T2, \n\neach one coupled to a rotary pump). T1 evacuates the two MCs and a part of the remaining \n\nvacuum system. Before filling the gas, the vacuum system is first evacuated with the two \n\npumps simultaneously pumping. For this purpose, the reduction-valve (at the exit of the \n\nbottle) is closed and the rest of the valves in the system are open. This task requires some \n\ncaution since the differential pressure between the two sides of the membrane can damage \n\nit.  \n\nTo place the gas inside the system valve V4 is closed and, through the reduction valve \n\n(the one immediately following to the gas bottle), the volume between these two valves \n\nis filled (including vessel 1).  \n\nTo make the gas flow through the membrane, the valves connecting the vacuum \n\nsystem to the pumps (V6 and V3) are closed. Note that the two MCs can continue being \n\nevacuated by T1, which is crucial to keep low levels of air inside the MCs during our \n\nexperiment.  Then, to isolate the two sides of the membrane, valve V1 is also closed. To \n\ncollect the gas after it passes through the membrane, vessel 2 is submersed in liquid \n\nnitrogen (LN2). V4 is also completely open and the needle valve (V2) allows controlling \n\nthe gas flow through the membrane. Pirani 1 and pirani 2 give us information about the \n\ndifferential pressure between the two sides of the membrane. We use this information to \n\nestimate the relative17 gas flow through the membrane. Finally, to recollect the gas in \n\nvessel 1, valve V1 is open and the nitrogen is changed from vessel 2 to vessel 1, leading \n\nto gas liquefaction in vessel 1. The gas can be stored in this volume by closing valve V4. \n\n5.1.4. The Light source \n\nThe light source used is an ACTON product, ARC Model DS-775 Deuterium Light \n\nSource. The useful wavelength range of this source is from 115 nm to 370 nm, with a \n\ncontinuum from 165 nm to 370 nm and many lines from 115 nm to 165 nm. Physically \n\nthis device is very compact and couples perfectly to MC2. The beam section is \n\napproximately 1 mm in diameter and is located 10.16 cm away from the MC2 entry \n\nflange. The source has a typical Lyman-alpha radiance of over one miliwatt per mm2-nm-\n\nsteradian. In figure 27, the lamp output spectrum is plotted, as given by the manufacturer. \n\nThe highest line corresponds to the Lyman-alpha line of deuterium (the theoretical value \n\n                                                 \n17 We are not capable of measure with precision the nominal flux rate since our pressure gauges are not \n\nprecise neither properly calibrated for the gases used. \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nis 1215.31 \u00c5 [44]).

It is \n\nequipped with a bialkali photocathode and it has low radioactivity, active area of 26 mm2, \n\n10 stage dynodes and a head-on type synthetic silica window. Its spectroscopic response \n\nlies in the range from 160 to 650 nm. The cathode sensitivity is typically 100 ?A/lm and \n\nthe quantum efficiency at 175 nm is 30%.  It was assembled in an E10411MOD \n\nHamamatsu socket with maximum voltage +1000 V and a divider current of 364 ?A (at \n\n+1000 V). \n\nThe PMT was polarized by a HV-board (NHQ-206L). The PMT signal was collected \n\nby a Canberra 2005 pre-amplifier and then amplified in a Tennelec TC 243 linear \n\namplifier and digitalized in a Nucleus multi-channel analyser (MCA) connected to a \n\ncomputer, where a graphical interface allows to visualise the pulse height distribution. \n\nThe best choice of the amplifier parameters to distinguish photons counted from the noise \n\nlevel was found by visualizing the plots in the MCA. The coarse and fine gains were \n\nrespectively 100 and 5 and the peaking time was 1 ?s, while the PMT socket polarization \n\nwas 950V. The pulses were also visualized in a Tektronix TDS 210 oscilloscope.  \n\nNucleus is the native MCA software and it is possible to program it for continuous \n\nmulti-acquisition. For example, Nucleus can acquire without interruption 1000 spectra of \n\n1 second each (the minimum acquisition time). These spectra were saved in independent \n\nfiles (.spm extension). These files can then be converted to ASCII format (using the \n\nsoftware Specon 2000 v1.3) and thus easily handled using MATLAB. The number of \n\n \n\nFigure 27:  Relative throughput (uncorrected) of the ARC VUV Deuterium Source, \n\nthrough the VM-502 MC (100 micron slits) and the RSC-100 Vacuum Reflectometer, as a \n\nfunction of wavelength. This image comes from the device manual. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nacquisitions and the acquisition time should be chosen according with the MC scanning \n\nrange and rate in such a way that the MC and the Nucleus start and finish at the same \n\ntime. Subsequently an algorithm (SpeGen) was developed in MATLAB that, for each file,  \n\ncountsthe number of photons collected,  and plots the spectrum of the light collected as \n\nfunction of the wavelength.  \n\nThis method requires the perfect synchronization between the start of the Nucleus \n\nacquisition and the MC operation. However, even if the two systems start with a delay of \n\nfor example half of a second, in the worst scenario (when the scan speed is the highest, \n\n10 nm/s) the error in the spectrum will be 0.083 nm, which would mean a constant shift \n\nof 0.0083 nm in the entire spectrum relative to the true values. \n\n5.1.6. Gases choice \n\nThe gas used in a first stage should be a noble gas for two reasons: noble gases are \n\ninert so they won\u2019t react with other materials and, therefore, their handling is very simple; \n\nusually they are monoatomic gases so at proper pressures we have a clean line-type \n\nabsorption/emission atomic spectrum.  \n\nSince we intend to study some specific atomic transitions, we must eliminate all the \n\npossible light emission in other wavelengths. Then we must reduce any decay channel \n\nother than the resonance fluorescence. This can be accomplished by reducing the gas \n\npressure to a few mbar [45]. \n\nIn a next stage polyatomic gases may also be used to study the molecular bound \n\nenergy shifts induced by Casimir cavities.  \n\n5.2. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations \n\nTo better understand the behaviour of the electromagnetic radiation incidence in the \n\nporous membrane and the flow of gas molecules through the membrane, we made some \n\nsimulations using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. \n\n5.2.1. Gas flow dynamics \n\nAs we intend to use low pressures (up to a few mbar), for nanometric pores we \n\nbelieve that the gas flow will always stay in the molecular flow regime. Our membranes \n\nhave 50, 100 and 400 nm pore-diameters, so we will consider the bigger ones to estimate \n\nthe maximum pressure at which it is still valid to consider a molecular flow. We want to \n\nconfirm if in our system we will always have a molecular flow and then make the \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nsimulations accordingly. In agreement with ref. [46], we can use the Knudsen number \n\n(which relates the molecule mean free path with the pipe diameter) to estimate if a flux is \n\nin the molecular or viscous regime. Considering the pores as pipes of diameter 400 nm \n\nand the gas molecules with diameter 216 pm (xenon atomic diameter [47]) at room \n\ntemperature, we found out the maximum pressure at which the molecular flow regime is \n\nstill valid to be ~496 mbar. As we will use much lower pressures, we will consider the \n\ngas flow through the membrane to be in the molecular regime.  \n\nHence we simulated the gas atoms considering them as free particles and tracking \n\neach atom. Thus, they obey to the Newton classic laws of motion with initial and after-\n\ncollision random velocities and orientations (Monte Carlo method). Some other \n\napproximations were made: the model follows the Kinetic Molecular Theory, the particles \n\ndon\u00b4t collide with each others and the simulation was made in two dimensions. The molar \n\nmass of the gas is 28 g/mol, the temperature is 25\u00baC and the pressure 100 Pa (1 mbar). \n\nOur main purpose here is to estimate the average time for an atom to cross the \n\nmembrane, so we idealize the worst porosity scenario, a highly irregular porous \n\ndistribution (with broader time distribution of the crossing atoms), as shown in figure 28. \n\nWe made the membrane with average pore size of 200 nm, and thickness of 1700 nm, \n\nwhich is thinner than our membranes.  \n\nA great number of particles (few tens of thousands) were emitted against the \n\nmembrane; the ones that have returned back or have gone outside the model limits are \n\nconsidered frozen. We tracked the remaining particles until they reach the opposite \n\nmembrane side.  \n\nIn figure 28 we can see the path of each atom when the simulation is finished (a), in \n\nthis particular example only two of them being able to cross the membrane, and the actual \n\nposition of the particles while the simulation is still running (b). \n\n \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nThis simulation allows computing the number of particles that crossed the membrane \n\nas a function of time. In this way, we can estimate the average time to cross the membrane. \n\nIn figure 29 we present (blue dots) the time distribution of the particles crossing the \n\nmembrane and a smoothed curve (red) of this data to better understand its behaviour since \n\nour data have poor statistics. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28: Plots from COMSOL simulations showing particles flowing through a porous \n\nmembrane with 1700 nm thickness and an averaged pore side of 200 nm. The particles are \n\ninitially emitted from the top boundary and collected in the bottom. a) Particle path after the \n\nsimulation stops, for an initial number of particles of 500 and a total time of 10?7 ?. b) Particle \n\nposition while the simulation is still running, for an initial number of particles of 50000 and a \n\ntotal time of 10?8 ?. The colours of the paths and particles are related to their velocity, in a \n\nrainbow scale, the blue ones are the slower and the red ones the faster.  \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nNow we have a more clear idea about the typical times that the gas atoms take to \n\ncross a porous membrane.  \n\nTo know if an excited atom can cross the membrane without decaying by \n\nspontaneous emission, we will compare the typical lifetime of the resonant states with the \n\ntravel time through a membrane. The first resonance states that decay by spontaneous \n\nemission have typical lifetimes of a few nanoseconds [48][49]. As an example, for two \n\nresonance states of Xe, 3P1 (we intend to use it in our experiment) and \n1P1, the lifetimes \n\nwere experimentally measured, being respectively (3.79 \u00b1 1.12)  \u00d7 10?9 ? and (3.17 \u00b1\n\n0.19)  \u00d7 10?9 ? [50]. As seen, these values are at least one order of magnitude shorter \n\nthan the average time for an atom to cross a 1700 nm membrane. So we can conclude \n\nthat, if an excited atom enters the membrane, most likely it will decay inside, and if an \n\natom gets excited inside the membrane it can only decay outside if it gets excited near the \n\nexit.  \n\nWe should still note that we do not consider the lifetime modification induced by the \n\nCasimir cavity. As we also did not consider how deep inward the pores we can coat using \n\nthe metal evaporation technique. So the membrane effective thickness will be different \n\nfrom the original thickness. \n\n5.2.2. Electromagnetic dynamics through the pores \n\nAs the wavelengths used in the experiment (VUV region) are of the same order of \n\nmagnitude than the pore size, we expect a wave-like behaviour. To have a clear idea about \n\n \n\nFigure 29: Number of particles arriving at the bottom of the membrane as a function of \n\ntime. In blue, we show the results of the simulation; in red, a smooth curve following the blue \n\npoints. The smooth curve peak is approximately at 3.5 \u00d7 10?8 ?. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nthe light propagation through the pores, we made some simulations with the COMSOL \n\nsoftware using classic electrodynamics. For simplicity and due to computer limitations, \n\nwe performed the simulation again in two dimensions. \n\nThe membrane pores were represented by 3 small holes (in 2D) crossing an \n\naluminium block. The remaining area of our simulation was filled with air. The \n\nelectromagnetic waves were generated by electric oscillating dipoles whose frequency \n\ngives us the desired radiation wavelength. To simulate all radiation polarizations, the \n\ndipoles have perpendicular directions between each other.  \n\nFirst we put a set of dipoles in one side of the membrane and analysed the radiation \n\ncrossing the pores. Then we vary the diameter (D) of the pores and their thickness (L). \n\nSome results are shown in figure 30.  \n\n     \n\n     \n\nFigure 30: Two-dimensional view of the power per unit of area (?/?2) of the radiation \n\ncrossing the membrane for different membrane sizes: a) D = 75 nm and L = 2000 nm; b) D = \n\n200 nm and L = 2000 nm; c) D = 400 nm and L = 2000 nm; d) D = 400 nm and L = 1000 nm. \n\nThe radiation wavelength was 200 nm for all the plots. The colours are related to the power \n\na) \n\nc) d) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nAs expected, for pore diameters much smaller than the radiation wavelength there is \n\na great attenuation, as we can see in figure 30 a). It is also evident the wave-like behaviour \n\nof the light for pore sizes with the same order of magnitude than the wavelength. For \n\nexample, in figure 30 a) and b), we can see that the light has an interference pattern and \n\ncomes out from the pores in all directions. In figure 30 c) and d), the immerging light has \n\na behaviour more similar to a beam since the holes have already a size twice the \n\nwavelength. It is also clear that the shorter holes, shown in figure 30 d), allow more light \n\nto pass through them than the longer ones, shown in figure 30 c). \n\nSubsequently we computed the radiation transmittance through the membrane as a \n\nfunction of the hole diameter. The radiation wavelength was fixed at 200 nm and we \n\ncomputed the total power collected at the membrane exit. The power transmittance is \n\nshown in figure 31. As expected the transmittance is higher for larger pores and almost \n\nzero for pore sizes smaller than half of the radiation wavelength.  \n\nTo have a clear idea of the radiation propagation when emitted from inside the pores, \n\nwe simulated the electric dipoles inside them. For that, we placed two dipoles in the centre \n\nof each pore, one with the same orientation of the pore walls (P1) and the other one with \n\norientation perpendicular to the walls (P2).  \n\nFirst, we studied the differences in the dipole orientations and noticed that, for small \n\ndiameters (L = 40 nm) the radiation is almost fully suppressed for P1 but not for P2. This \n\nbehaviour was expected since the electric dipoles emit mostly in its perpendicular \n\nintensity so that in the rainbow scale the red is the higher power and the blue the lower. The \n\ncolour scale is similar in all the plots.  \n\n \n\nFigure 31: Radiation transmittance as a function of the pore diameter. The radiation \n\nwavelength is 200 nm and the pore thickness is 2000 nm. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\ndirection, thus for P1 the radiation is reflected in the walls and then suppressed (Casimir \n\ncondition). \n\nNext, we made several simulations varying the pore dimensions with the two internal \n\ndipoles (P1 and P2). Two examples of the results are shown in figure 32, where it is \n\npossible to note, in a) and b), that for larger D values there is much more radiation coming \n\nout of the largest holes, an evident effect of the suppressive influence of the cavities when \n\nthey are shorter than the radiation wavelength. \n\nWe also made some simulations for the highly porous membrane model used in \n\nsection 5.2.1 by varying the radiation wavelength. We noticed that, for shorter radiation \n\nwavelengths, the penetration in the membrane and its transmittance is higher. An example \n\nis shown in figure 32 c), where it is perceptible the light preferential paths and some zones \n\nwhere the light was mostly suppressed. \n\n \n\n   \n\nFigure 32: a) and b) two dimensional views of the power per unit of area (?/?2) of the \n\nradiation emitted from inside the membrane for different membrane sizes: a) D = 300 nm and \n\nL = 2000 nm; b) D = 40 nm and L = 2000 nm. c) two dimensional view of  the power per unit \n\nof area of the radiation emitted from the top against the membrane, with the same highly porous \n\nmaterial used in section 5.2.1.

Results and discussion \n\n6.1. Preliminary tests and calibration \n\nBefore we started our experiments it was necessary to perform some tests and \n\ncalibrations, particularly of the MCs. These are described in the following sections. \n\n6.1.1. Delay correction of the Nucleus multi-spectrum utility \n\nAfter we\u2019ve acquired some spectrum we noticed an annoying problem in the Nucleus \n\nmulti-spectrum utility. When we started the MC driver at the same time that the Nucleus \n\nsoftware we observed that the Nucleus always continued the acquisition (and generated \n\nnew files) a few seconds after the MC stopped. The origin of the problem was a small \n\n(much less than 1 second) delay every time the program saved a file. We performed a test \n\nfor different conditions and concluded that the delay was related with the file name length. \n\nWe then operated the Nucleus so that it saved all the files with the same filename length \n\nand observed that the delay was always the same. \n\nIn order to solve this Nucleus feature, we improved our MATLAB code (SpeGen) so \n\nthat it would take into account this delay and make the corrections. \n\n6.1.2. Choice of the MCA counting window \n\nEach pulse height distribution recorded by the Nucleus PCA has a considerable \n\namount of noise which can attributed to several phenomena. Therefore, integrating the \n\ncounts in all channels is not the best option. Instead we\u2019ve used a window of channels \n\nwhich corresponds to the photon counts. In figure 33 there is an example of a typical pulse \n\nheight distribution spectrum when the PMT is irradiated directly by the lamp. The \n\nprominent peak corresponds to the pulse amplitude distribution of typical photon counts \n\nwhich adopts the expected Gaussian distribution. To determine if the centroid of this \n\ndistribution changes with the counting rating we\u2019ve taken a set of spectra with distinct \n\ncounting rates and fit a gauss function superimposed on a linear background to each one. \n\nLastly, with the fitting output information we plot the variation of the Gaussian centroid \n\nas a function of its amplitude. The As result we\u2019ve observed a very evident non variation, \n\nshowing that we can use a fixed channel interval to analyse our spectrum. This interval \n\ngoes from the channel 100 to the channel 240. This range was chosen, taking into account \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nthe centroid and FWHM of the gauss and also the shape of the background noise \n\ndistribution. \n\nIn figure 33 a second structure at the right side of the gauss curve is also visible. This \n\nstructure becomes similar to the main peak when the incident photon rate is increased. In \n\nsuch cases we noticed that the channel corresponding to the centroid of this peak is exactly \n\nthe double of the main peak. This lead us to conclude that this second peak was generated \n\nwhen two photons reached the photocathode with a small time difference being the \n\nresulting primary charge doubled relatively to when only a single photon reaches the \n\nphotocathode. The resulting output pulse is also doubled. We notice also that, when the \n\nincident photon rate is much greater, several peaks started to appear. The centroids \n\nchannel of these peaks were integer multiples of the main peak. These peaks are almost \n\nimpossible to distinguish since they overlap with each other and with a giant background \n\nnoise. For this reason we will avoid working in such high rate conditions. This is possible \n\nsince we can control the amount of light collected by closing the horizontal MC slits \n\n(which also increases its resolution).    \n\nIn figure 33 we also plotted a typical MCA spectra recorded without PMT irradiation \n\nwere a considerable amount of noise is visible, even in the channel window that we\u2019ve \n\nselected (channel 100 to 240). This background is not subtracted since we are not \n\ninterested in absolute values but only in relative ones and the pulse height distribution \n\n \n\nFigure 33: a) PMT pulse height distribution as recorded by the MCA when the PMT was \n\nirradiated with ~92 nm light.

Acquisition time 3 sec. b) \n\nPMT pulse height distribution recorded by the MCA without light irradiation; in blue, number \n\nof counts as a function of the channel. Acquisition time 3 sec. \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n(related to the intensity18 of the collected radiation) doesn\u2019t change its form due to the \n\nbackground (which is constant for all the wavelengths).  \n\n6.1.3. Light attenuation with the pressure \n\nThe wavelengths below 200 nm are strongly absorbed by the matter, including the \n\nair [51] and, to allow its transmission in a closed apparatus, it must be evacuated. This is \n\nthe reason why this range of the electromagnetic spectrum is called Vacuum UV (VUV). \n\nAt shorter wavelengths (until ~150 ??) the main absorber present in the air is the \n\noxygen, being possible to use nitrogen atmospheres to transmit these wavelengths. \n\nHowever for shorter wavelengths even nitrogen becomes an absorber. \n\nTo ensure that the vacuum achievable inside the MCs does not affect their \n\nfunctionality we\u2019ve performed a simple test and measured the radiation attenuation across \n\nthe MC optical path, as a function of the pressure inside the MC.  \n\nFor this we\u2019ve used MC2 (it has demonstrated to have the poorest vacuum quality) \n\nand assembled the PMT at the MC output flange and the deuterium lamp at the input, \n\nwhile evacuating the setup using T1.  \n\nTo measure the pressure inside the MC we\u2019ve used a pirani and a penning vacuum \n\ngauges assembled directly in a third MC vacuum flange. These monochromators are \n\nequipped with 3 input/output flanges. Two of them are used in our measurements as input \n\nand output for the radiation. The third flange was not used in our main experiment and is \n\nonly used when different geometrical MC configurations are necessary.  \n\nTo figure the relative light intensity we\u2019ve summed all the counts between the \n\nchannels 100 and 220 of the pulse height distribution, without any background \n\nsubtraction. To change the pressure inside the MC we\u2019ve closed the vacuum pump valve \n\nfor a while and, to achieve higher pressures, we slightly opened the air inlet valve (there \n\nis a valve embedded in the MC which connects directly with the atmospheric pressure). \n\nThe wavelength was fixed at 170 nm and the two slits were adjusted to 45 ?m. The light \n\nintensity as a function of the pressure inside the MC is shown in figure 34. \n\n                                                 \n18 Every time we refer to light intensity this is not an absolute quantity. Since in our experiment we are \n\nnot interested in measure absolute values but only its variation with some other parameter, our light \n\nintensity is just a quantity proportional to the number of photons which the PMT collects. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nWe can now conclude that in fact there is some attenuation when the pressure inside \n\nthe MC is increased. However it only happens at higher pressures, for lower pressures the \n\nvariation is almost inexistent. For the pressures at which we will operate at (less than 2 \u00d7\n\n10?3 ????) the attenuation is negligible and thus we conclude that the residual air \n\nabsorption in our system does not play an important role, at least for the wavelength that \n\nwe\u2019ve used in this measurement (170 nm). \n\nIt\u2019s important to refer that the vacuum gauges used are not perfectly calibrated and \n\nsome of these measurements were done in the limits of their sensitivity range. These \n\nfactors make the absolute values measured doubtful; however as we\u2019ve used these same \n\nvacuum gauges in our main experiment, this study was enough to estimate the required \n\nvacuum (measured with these gauges) in order to minimize the light attenuation. \n\n6.1.4. MCs calibration  \n\nFor the calibration of the MC we\u2019ve used the Lyman-alpha line of the deuterium \n\nwhose theoretical value is 1215.31 \u00c5 [44] since we don\u2019t have the exact information \n\nrelative to the other lines observed in the spectrum. As the reader may notice, this \n\nwavelength is outside of our PMT working range (160 - 650 nm). However we observed \n\nthat, even with reduced quantum efficiency, the PMT was able to detect light under its \n\nlower limit. Then, for each of the MCs, we\u2019ve assembled the lamp on their input flange \n\nand the PMT directly on the output flange. We then made a scan in a range were we would \n\nexpect to find the 1215.31 \u00c5 resonant line. A typical spectrum (already offset corrected) \n\nobtained for MC1 is shown in figure 35. We can now compare our spectrum with the one \n\n \n\nFigure 34: Relative light intensity as a function of the MC pressure, data recorded using: \n\na) a penning vacuum gauge; b) a pirani vacuum gauge. These two tests are independent. \n\nAcquisition time of each spectrum = 15 ? \n\nb) a) \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nprovided in the ARC VUV Deuterium Source manual (figure 27) and conclude that our \n\ninstrumentation is working accordingly with the manufacturer specifications. \n\n \n\nIn order to accurately determine the offset of the monochromators, we made a new \n\nscan (for MC1 and for MC2) focused in the range where we found the Lyman-alpha line. \n\nThis new scan had a slower scan rate and more data points per wavelength unit. Lastly \n\n \n\nFigure 35: Deuterium lamp spectrum obtained by scanning the wavelength range from \n\n1100 to 1300 \u00c5 with MC1. . Both horizontal slits were adjusted at 45 ?m and the vertical ones \n\nat 3 mm. Acquisition time at each wavelenght  = 3 ?. Scanning rate = 4 \u00c5/min. \n\n \n\nFigure 36: Spectrum obtained by scanning the wavelength range from 1100 to 1300 \u00c5 with \n\nMC1. Scanning rate of 0.5 \u00c5/min. Acquisition time at each wavelength= 3 ?. Horizontal slits \n\nwere adjusted at 35 ?m and the vertical ones at 3 mm. The graphic represents the counts as a \n\nfunction of the wavelength. At blue the number of counts for each wavelength and at red a fit \n\nof a gauss function superimposed on a linear function. The centroid and FWMH are \n\nrespectively ~1215.30 \u00c5 and ~0.86 \u00c5 which corresponds to an energy resolution of 0.07 %. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nwe made a fit of a Gaussian plus a linear function to the Lyman-alpha peak. The fitting \n\nparameters allowed us to compute the MC offset and FHWM, figure36. \n\nThe MC1 driver allowed the automatic offset correction by inserting in the software \n\na specific value; however for the MC2 driver the only solution is the operator to manually \n\ninsert the desired wavelength taking in account the offset.  \n\n6.2. Experimental results and discussion \n\nAfter calibrating all the instrumentation and confirming that the system is working \n\nproperly we continued for the main experience.  \n\nWe\u2019ve used two membranes with pore diameter of 0.1 ?m, one uncoated and the \n\nother coated with Aluminium. The membrane was evaporated four times in two \n\nperpendicular directions for two opposite 45\u00ba angles (relatively to the path of the \n\nevaporated Al). Taking into account the size of the pores, in order to avoid obstructing \n\nthem, the thickness of each film was of 5 nm. This value was read from a plane surface \n\northogonal to the evaporation path, and at the same distance from the source as the \n\nmembrane. We\u2019ve only coated one side of the membrane, the less roughened. After the \n\nevaporation we\u2019ve assembled the membrane with the coated side facing the MC2 light \n\nexit (which also corresponded to the gas inlet on the main chamber). \n\nIn all the spectra of this section, we\u2019ve considered only the events between the \n\nchannels 100 and 240 (from the Nucleus MCA pulse height distribution files). For each \n\nwavelength, the counts in these channels were summed, being this sum a point in the \n\nfollowing spectra, which present the radiation intensity as a function of the wavelength. \n\nFor some of the spectrums the acquisition time for each wavelength was longer than 1 \n\nsecond. In these cases the number of events was normalised to 1 second.  \n\nWe start by studying the shifts in the atomic ground state using only the MC1 \n\nconnected to the PMT, which analysed the radiation emitted from the main chamber. In \n\nour preliminary tests we observed that the PMT sensitivity starts to rise abruptly for \n\nwavelengths above 1500 nm and, since the MC upper wavelength limit is 5500 nm we \n\nhave scanned the range going from 1500 nm to 5500 nm. In another preliminary test \n\nwe\u2019ve confirmed that if we closed the MC1 entrance the background was the same that \n\nwhen the main chamber was evacuated and the MC1 was open. Therefore we conclude \n\nthat there is no radiation in the main chamber when it is in vacuum and that, in our \n\nmeasurements, we can consider as background the signal recorded when the MC1 \n\nentrance is closed.  \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nWe then made a set of scans for different conditions: 1) background scan: before the \n\nprincipal measurements with the MC1 entrance closed, measuring the signals from the \n\nPMT + MC1; 2) with Xe flowing through the uncoated membrane; 3) with Xe flowing \n\nthrough the Al-coated membrane; 4) with a greater Xe flow rate through the Al-coated \n\nmembrane; 5) background scan, taken after the data taking, again with the MC1 entrance \n\nclosed.  \n\n \n\nFigure 34:  Photon intensity as a function of the wavelength for different conditions: 1) \n\nbackground at the beginning of the experiment \u2013 taken with the MC1 entrance closed; slits = \n\n505 ?m; scan rate = 100 \u00c5/min;  MCA acquisition time = 1 s. 2) scan with the uncoated \n\nmembrane with Xe flowing; differential pressure of ~0.3 ????; slits = 505 ?m; scan rate = \n\n100 \u00c5/min;  MCA acquisition time = 1 s. 3) scan with the Al-coated membrane with Xe \n\nflowing; differential pressure of ~0.3 ????; slits = 505 ?m; scan rate = 100 \u00c5/min;  MCA \n\nacquisition time = 1 s. 4) scan with the Al-coated membrane with higher Xe flowing; \n\ndifferential pressure of ~0.4 ????;slits = 5005 ?m; scan rate = 200 \u00c5/min; MCA acquisition \n\ntime = 1 s. 5) background at the end of the experiment; MC2 entrance closed; slits = 5005 ?m; \n\nscan rate = 200 \u00c5/min; MCA acquisition time = 1 s. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nThe results of these scans are plotted in figure 34. For each case the entrance and exit \n\nslits aperture was the same, for some of the measurements the slits aperture was larger to \n\nallow a greater light entrance, and for other cases the aperture was smaller to improve the \n\nresolution. For the cases when there was Xe flowing through the chamber, we controlled \n\nthe flow by adjusting a needle valve (located at the gas inlet of the main chamber). The \n\ndifferential pressure between the two sides of the membrane allowed to estimate the gas \n\nflow through the membrane. \n\nSince it\u2019s difficult to observe the differences between the individual plots of figure \n\n34 we made a smooth curve to each spectrum and compared them in the same plot (figure \n\n35). Without the smooth curve it would be visually very confuse to present all the data in \n\nthe same plot. \n\nWe can see some interesting differences between the curves presented in figure 35. \n\nFor the coated membrane it is possible to see a photon intensity greater at shorter \n\n \n\nFigure 35: Smoothing of the curves presented in figure 34. The smoothing was the same \n\nfor all the curves. The legends and axis have the same meaning as in figure 34. \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\nwavelengths and, while for the uncoated membrane the same behaviour is present, it is \n\nnot so noticeable. Moreover these two spectrum are globally slightly higher than the two \n\nbackground spectrums. However we made another scan were we\u2019ve used the coated \n\nmembrane but for a greater flow rate and greater slits aperture (coated greater flow series \n\nin figures 34 and 35) but in this we\u2019ve recorded a photon intensity similar to the one of \n\nthe background. This last test suggests that the difference in the two other scans can be \n\nattributed to a fluctuation of the instrumentation and not to the radiation detected by our \n\nPMT. Nevertheless the two first tests with Xe flowing are coherent with our proposals, \n\nsince more radiation it was observed for the coated (for which the ZPF modes are more \n\neffectively suppressed) than for the uncoated membrane. However a more careful study \n\nis required in the future, since we cannot conclude for now if there was radiation emitted \n\nfrom the main chamber, or not.  \n\nIn another measurement we\u2019ve used the MC2 to irradiate the main chamber with a \n\nselected wavelength. The Xe is the noble gas which has the lowest energy resonance \n\ntransition of the noble gases [45], which is an advantage for our purposes, since our PMT \n\nwas designed for a relatively low energy range (160 - 650 nm). The lower resonance \n\nenergy level of Xe is the 3P1, whose transition energy relatively to the ground state is 8.43 \n\neV (~147.1 nm), hence we used that transition. Unfortunately this transition wavelength \n\nis outside the PMT working range but, since we were able to perform spectroscopy \n\nmeasurements for wavelengths much lower (for example until 110 nm, figure 27 ) then, \n\nif there is enough radiation reaching the PMT, it could be possible to distinguish the Xe \n\nemission from the noise and to make a reliable spectroscopic analysis. \n\nOne of the methods proposed in section 4.1 suggests that if we excited the atoms with \n\nsome characteristic wavelength, once inside the Casimir-cavity they could radiate and \n\nemit a lower wavelength that the one with which the atoms were excited. To study this \n\neffect we irradiated the Xe atoms outside of the membrane with using a wavelength of \n\n147.1 nm (first resonance transition of Xe) and, then made the gas flow thought the nano-\n\npores, while in other side of the membrane we analysed the radiation emitted using MC1. \n\nThe resulting spectrum is shown in figure 36. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\nWe cannot see in figure 36 the expected radiation emitted for wavelengths shorter \n\nthan 147.1 nm, however we cannot also see the excitation wavelength (147.1 nm). This \n\nlast observation suggests that system is not sensitive enough for this wavelength range.  \n\nIt is also possible that the wavelength emitted is shorter than the analysed range lower \n\nlimit, which would be observed in the case a larger than expected ground state shift would \n\noccur. \n\nWe then proceeded  to other method, also proposed in section 4.1.4, according to \n\nwhich if we irradiate the atoms with a wavelength greater than their characteristic \n\ntransition (in this case 147.1 nm), they could be successfully excited if inside the Casimir \n\ncavity the (since the shift in the excited state would be greater than the shift in the ground \n\nstate). Consecutively, when the atoms returned to the free space, they would emit their \n\ncharacteristic transition wavelength (in this case 147.1 nm), since the ZPF would re-\n\nenergised its ground and exited states back to the normal energies. In our system we made \n\nthree spectral analyses (using the MC1) for three different excitation wavelength ranges. \n\nThe photon intensity distribution of the excitation beam has a Gaussian form with centroid \n\nat the wavelength inserted in the MC2 controller and with the width defined by the MC2 \n\nslits aperture. We regulated the entrance and exit slits of MC2 to 5.005 mm (the maximum \n\nslit aperture) since in this step it was required to irradiate as much as possible in \n\nwavelengths longer than 147.1 nm. The results for the three different irradiation \n\nwavelength ranges are shown in figures 37, 38 and 39. \n\n \n\nFigure 36: Spectrum recorded with MC1 when the main chamber was irradiated using \n\nphotons with wavelength of 147.1 nm. The Al-coated membrane was inside the main chamber \n\nand Xe was flowing. The  differential pressure on both sides of the membrane was \n\n~0.35 ????; slits MC2 = 5005 ?m; slits MC1 = 2005 ?m; scan rate = 50 \u00c5/min; MCA \n\nacquisition time = 2 s. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 37: Spectrum recorded with MC1 when the Al-coated membrane was irradiated \n\nwith 250.2 nm light and Xe flowing with  a differential pressure of ~0.35 ????;slits MC2 = \n\n5005 ?m; slits MC1 = 5005 ?m; scan rate = 50 \u00c5/min; MCA acquisition time = 1 s. \n\n \n\nFigure 38:  Spectrum recorded with MC1 when the Al-coated membrane was irradiated \n\nwith 200.1 nm light  and Xe flowing with  a differential pressure of ~0.35 ????; slits MC2 \n\n5005 ?m; slits MC1 = 5005 ?m; scan rate = 100 \u00c5/min; MCA acquisition time = 2 s. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\nIn the first measurement, figure 37, the excitation wavelength centred on 250.2 nm \n\nis perfectly visible. To have a clear idea of the width of the excitation wavelength \n\ndistribution we made a fit to the peak at 250.2 nm, figure 37. The adjusted function was \n\na gauss superimposed on a linear background, being the FWHM = 13.5 nm. Although the \n\nFWHM would probably change with the wavelength we used this value (13.5 nm) to \n\nestimate where should be the next excitation wavelength centroid so that it could be \n\npossible to distinguish it from the Xe characteristic wavelength (147.1 nm). In the next \n\nmeasurements, figures 38 and 39, the excitation wavelength is not visible; this can be due \n\nto the lower light source intensity at this wavelength or to the membrane reflectivity for \n\nthis wavelength, amongst other possibilities. Despite that this observation seems to \n\nsuggest that for wavelengths shorter than ~250 nm our system doesn\u2019t has enough \n\nluminosity or sensitivity; it may not be the case. In fact we may have the necessary \n\ncondition but the Al-film can be reflecting more for longer wavelengths, because its \n\nreflectivity depends of the wavelength. However, as we\u2019ve seen before in section 4.2.1 \n\nthis behaviour seems to be constant in this wavelength range. Still other factors can \n\ninfluence, such as the light reflected by the stainless steel chamber walls whose \n\nreflectivity will be different that the one of Al . In figures 38 and 39 it is also not visible \n\nthe Xe characteristic transition wavelength (147.1 nm), as it was expected by this method. \n\nHowever, as we have demonstrated in the past, our instrumentation can detect radiation \n\nin these wavelengths, and therefore our results are not due to the sensitivity of our system. \n\nAnyway, the experimental work is at its very beginning and many studies are needed \n\nto understand our system and improve its performance, e.g. using a PMT with an MgF2 \n\nwindow, reducing the PMT noise level, amongst other aspects. Nevertheless, under the \n\npresent MSc work, we leave an experimental system fully operational. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39:  Spectrum recorded with MC1 when the Al-coated membrane was irradiated \n\nwith 165.2 nm light  and Xe flowing with  a differential pressure of ~0.35 ????; slits MC2 \n\n5005 ?m; slits MC1 = 5005 ?m; scan rate = 100 \u00c5/min; MCA acquisition time = 2 s. \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\n7. Conclusions and future work \n\nIn this document we tried to present a complete study regarding the energy extraction \n\nfrom the ZPF. This subject was treated with classic mechanics, specifically the SED since \n\nit is more intuitive for our proposals than QM. However we also introduced a possible \n\ninterpretation of this subject in the QM realm, giving to the reader some references for a \n\nmore detailed study.  \n\nThe SED was here introduced with focus on the H atom. Due to the gap in the \n\nliterature concerning the behaviour of the atoms when immersed in a modified ZPF, we \n\ntried to create a model of this system by means of computational simulation. We then \n\ndeveloped a code to simulate the motion of the electron in the H atom immersed in a one-\n\ndimensional free space ZPF, and with it we were able to replicate some results of Cole et \n\nal [35] demonstrating that the electron radius distribution in the SED realm seems to \n\nconverge to the one predicted by QM. We therefore validated our code, which will be \n\nimportant for future applications. One of these applications would be to simulate the H \n\natom immersed in a cavity-modified ZPF. However, apart other problems with this \n\nalgorithm, we concluded that the ZPF generation method is not trusty for the small cavity \n\ncase. Therefore we generated a full 3D ZPF using two different methods, one of them \n\nwas first presented in the bibliography [32], and the other developed by us. Both of these \n\nmethods had success in the simulations related with the classic harmonic oscillator in the \n\nfree space. However for the harmonic oscillator immersed in a cavity-modified ZPF only \n\nthe method developed by us has shown coherent results. Thus, considering the \n\napproximation of two harmonic oscillators in quadrature for the electron orbit in the H \n\natom, we used our method to estimate the averaged radius variation with the cavity-\n\nmodified ZPF. As initially suggested the ground state H atom will undergo a level shift \n\nwhen immersed in a cavity-modified ZPF. However we don\u2019t take into account possible \n\ncavity-induced perturbations in the electron radiated power. Lastly we developed an \n\nalgorithm to integrate the electron motion in time in a full 3D model of the H atom. This \n\nalgorithm is similar to the previous; however significant improvements were made such \n\nas the inclusion of the ZPF magnetic part. Although this new method is a trustier \n\ndescription of the reality, our computational sources limited us so that we could not \n\nsimulate the free space case or accumulate enough statistic for the cavity case. During \n\nthese computational developments we also made some discovers important for future \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nimprovements of the methods studied and developed in this work. In particular, we found \n\nthat: the frequency window approximation seems to be not reliable for small boxes; the \n\none-dimensional ZPF generation is ambiguous for the free space; and for small boxes it \n\nis more suitable to use the perfect box method for an accurate ZPF generation. \n\nAfter these extensive computational investigations we proceeded to the experimental \n\ninvestigation, giving first to the reader a clear scheme of our method to extract energy \n\nfrom the ZPF. We discussed some hypothesis and corresponding topologies to adopt in \n\nthe experimental apparatus. However, we cannot directly apply our previous \n\ncomputational SED-related simulations in our experiment, since the simulations were \n\nonly developed as a proof of concept. Finally we made some assumptions necessary to \n\nimplement this theory in the real word.  \n\nWe projected and assembled an experimental apparatus capable of satisfying our \n\nconceptual ideas. Next we calibrated all the data acquisition instrumentation, developed \n\nsoftware to analyse the data and made some tests which proven the functionality of our \n\nsystem. \n\nFinally, we were able to study some of the methods proposed and discussed in the \n\nchapter 4. For the ground state shifts of Xe, despite some strange results, we didn\u2019t find \n\nany evidence of emitted radiation inside the main chamber. We essentially observed noise \n\nfrom the PMT + MC1 + data acquisition instrumentation. However, there could have been \n\nsome radiation which was masked by the noise. Still, there is possibility that the radiation \n\nemitted is not in the studied ranges.  \n\nFor the two excited state type methods, we also could not detect any radiation in the \n\nexpected wavelengths, however we suspect that our system has poor sensitivity in these \n\nwavelengths. In fact, we\u2019ve also made some tests were we didn\u2019t used Xe flowing or the \n\nmembrane, only the two MC\u2019s face to face in vacuum. We\u2019ve irradiated the chamber with \n\na wavelength of147.1 nm (selected by MC2) while scanning the wavelengths using MC1 \n\nand failed to detect any radiation. We also noted that if we irradiated the PMT using \n\nlonger wavelengths, as for example 155 nm, the detected light was so much that it \n\nsaturates the PMT. Then, we conclude that our system is strongly limited in sensitivity \n\nfor these wavelengths, principally by the PMT. \n\nIt is also important to notice that, although our computational investigations and \n\ntheoretical assumptions were made for the electromagnetic vacuum at zero temperature, \n\nour research was made at room temperature, so in fact we cannot distinguish the vacuum \n\nfrom the thermal electromagnetic fluctuations.   \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n7.1.1. Future work \n\nFirst of all, an intensive theoretical investigation in the SED area, particularly for \n\ncavity enclosed atoms is needed. In the future we intend to make the same simulations \n\nwe made here but with the inclusion of the modifications in the electron emitted power \n\nrate induced by the cavity boundaries. These simulations should be made using the real \n\nColoumb potential and not the harmonic oscillator approximation. For that we intend to \n\nadapt our 3D H atom model to account for the cavity-modified damping constant. Hence, \n\nwe need to run the code in a cluster, first for the free space in order to validate it, and then \n\nto run it for a small cavity. In the simulations area we also intend to continue the \n\ndevelopment of an algorithm (an adaptation of our 3D algorithm for the H atom) which \n\naccounts the atomic inner structure, in collaboration with Rodr\u00edguez.  \n\nOur investigation is pioneer and consequently our experimental apparatus was the \n\nfirst attempt to investigate the theoretical hypothesis. Thus, after this investigation, we \n\nintend to make a lot of improvements in our apparatus. The most obvious is the need of a \n\nPMT more sensible in the region of the first resonance transitions of the heavier noble \n\ngases (100-160 nm would be enough [45]). Alternatively other atoms with less energetic \n\natomic transitions could be used as for example carbon which has a transition of 193.1 \n\nnm [52]. However, since these atoms don\u2019t appear isolated in the nature we would have \n\nto use for example a molecular gas (as for example CF4) and dissociate them first, which \n\nis not difficult since the dissociation energies are usually less than the atomic energies. \n\nTherefore, the radiation wavelength inserted in the system will dissociate the molecules \n\nand also excite the resonance state. \n\nOther important improvement is to minimize the light wastes by optical means. In \n\nthe present experiment the exit beam area was adjusted to illuminate all the membrane \n\narea and nothing more, however depending of the radiation wavelength and the gas type, \n\npart of the beam is absorbed in the gas. Then, and without changing the main chamber \n\ngeometry, the gas pressure should be low enough to allow a good membrane irradiation. \n\nFor this, we will study in the next step of our experience the gas transparency for the used \n\nwavelengths as a function of the pressure. We believe that, in the hypothesis which we \n\nirradiate the membrane with a wavelength equal to the gas resonance line, the light is \n\nstrongly attenuated, so the gas pressure will be determinant to ensure the membrane \n\nirradiation. However when the atoms are excited for resonance states they will release by \n\nspontaneous emission the same wavelength isotropically, so this effect also plays an \n\nimportant role in the calculation of the membrane illuminance. To maximize the collected \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nlight we intend to use a lens assembled inside the main chamber, close to the membrane \n\ngas outlet to focus the light emitted from this zone, in the MC1 entrance slit. \n\nA possible improvement would the use of porous-membranes integrally constructed \n\nof metal. This represents an improvement since the actual coated film depth also \n\ninfluences the efficiency of the cavity in suppressing the ZPF modes, being better for \n\nhigher depths. However this kind of materials is harder to obtain than the ones we used. \n\nFor future experiences with our experimental apparatus we intend to try others gases \n\nsuch as polyatomic gases. We expect that even vibrational molecular states will undergo \n\nlevel shifts when immersed in a modified ZPF, so instead of atomic transitions we can \n\napply the same method for molecular gases where the energies to explore would be lower. \n\nAs discussed in this work the dissociation and ionization energies can also undergo a level \n\nshift, so we intend to use in the future our equipment with other gases. Thus we can \n\nionize/dissociate them before entering inside the cavity, where they recombine releasing \n\na more energetic radiation that used to ionizing/dissociate them. In the case of using the \n\nmolecular dissociation process, the energies used would also be lower (as the case of H2), \n\nwhich represents an advantage when using our PMT. \n\nFinally, we suggest a little test less dependent of the sensibility problems shown by \n\nour present system: the PMT can be directly assembled in the main chamber exit (where \n\nis now assembled the MC1 entrance), the main chamber entrance should be closed from \n\nany light source. Then, the Xe is made to flow through the Al-coated membrane at \n\ndifferent rates, and perform acquisition of the PMT pulse counting, for each rate. Since \n\nfor greater flows it is expected to have more atoms entering into the pores, the emitted \n\nradiation rate will also be greater. Without the MC1 and for a greater solid angle, the \n\nhypothetical collected radiation will be much more intense. This approach is similar to \n\nthe one used in ref. [8] however, in our case, it will be for the UV-Visible range instead \n\nof IR range. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n8. Annexes \n\n8.1. Spherical Method introduction \n\nIn this section we will introduce what we called the \u201cSpherical Method\u201d to describe \n\nthe ZPF. We will not explain the method or the algorithm in detail since it was already \n\nintroduced and fully documented in other works [33][32]. \n\nThis method produces a set of ? k-vectors so that the correspondent frequencies sit \n\nbetween two limits, ???? and ???? (the same frequency window, ??, we had introduced \n\nin the section 2.2.2). The frequency spacing is imposed by the ?? and ?. For each \n\nfrequency a unique k-vector is generated with a random uniformly distributed direction. \n\nThis k-vector and its random directions are easily generated using spherical coordinates. \n\nConsecutively each k-vector can take any direction from the referential origin to any point \n\nof a sphere surface associated with the k-vector correspondent frequency. \n\nFor each k-vector 2 perpendicular vectors are also associated, they represent the two \n\npolarizations of the electric field. 2 random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and \n\n2? are then generated for each of these polarizations. Except the volume ?, we have all \n\nthe information needed to create a ZPF similar to the one described by equation 4. The \n\nmagnetic component of the ZPF is generated from the electric one as mentioned before \n\nin section 2.2.1. \n\nThe spherical method aims to generate an approximated ZPF inside a cubic box for \n\nthat in the k-space the k-vectors are distributed in a perfect cubic mesh. However, as we \n\nsaw the spherical method leads with random directions in spherical coordinates, thus the \n\nk-vectors don\u2019t have information about the cubic grid characteristic of a cubic box. Other \n\ndiscrepancy between this method and the reality is the number of k-vectors for the same \n\nfrequency. In this method there is only one k-vector to each frequency but in reality there \n\ncould be much more (since in a centred cubic mesh there are a lot of symmetric points \n\nwhose distance to the referential origin are the same).  Nevertheless it is claimed in ref. \n\n[32] that the spherical method is a good approximation when ? is great and ?? is small \n\nin such way the distribution of k-vectors is isotropic and similar to a spherical thin layer. \n\nIf there are a lot of waves between near frequencies (as in a big V which is the free space \n\napproximation) then, as the k-vectors density in k-space is large, the information of the \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nbox bounds is less important and the cubic grid disposition of the k-vectors becomes not \n\nimportant [32]. \n\nWe have implemented this method developing a code in MATLAB to generate this \n\nZPF. Making a simple representation, figure 37, of k-vectors for a big ? we visually \n\ntestify the isotropy of the generated ZPF k-vectors. \n\nFinally, for a specific N and ?? it is possible to compute the correspondent ? [32] \n\nand thus include this value in the normalization factor (\n1\n\n??\n). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 37: Three-dimensional representation of a set of k-vectors generated with the \n\nspherical method, all axis are in SI wavenumber units (??1). The ?? used is correspondent to \n\nthe Bohr radius with ? = 400 (the f number will be introduced in section 3.3). ? = 10036 \n\nwhich is equivalent to a box of  ? = 9 \u00d7 10?6 ?.  \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n8.2. ??? computation with the Spherical Method \n\nIn figure 38 we can see an example of a plot of the ???? computed by the Spherical \n\nMethod and the theoretical curve of the ???? for the free space.  \n\nAs we can see there is an incredible coincidence of the computed values and the \n\nanalytical function. Next a non-robust fit was done with equation 22 resulting in ? =\n\n?4,5 \u00b1 0,003 and ? = 2,65 \u00d7 10?54 \u00b1 2,00 \u00d7 10?55 very concordant with analytic \n\nvalues (presented before in this section).  \n\nFinally we can compute the ??? finding the point of the interception between the fitted \n\n???? and the theoretical ????  curve for the free space. In figure 39 we can see as an \n\nexample this intersection for a box of ? = ~10 \u00d7 10?5 ?.  \n\n \n\nFigure 38: Computed ???? for different random radius and the theoretical curve of ???? \n\nfor the free space, as given by the equation 16. The computation of the ???? was performed \n\nwith rs = 50,  ite = 2, f = 400, and ? = ~10 \u00d7 10?5 ? \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nFrom figure 10 we can see that the interception point is aproximatetly the Bohr \n\nradius, this shows the success of the method and validates the code and algorithm at least \n\nfor free space.  \n\nWe then made the same simulation for a smaller box, with ? = ~5 \u00d7 10?6. The \n\nresults are showed in figure 40. \n\nAs we can see from figure 40 there is a strange split of ????. This fact can indicates \n\na failure of this method (spherical method) when the box dimensions are small. This is \n\nvery probable since this method is only applicable in the limit of a great number of waves \n\nfor that the geometrical k-distribution in a cubic box is similar to the spherical k-\n\ndistribution generated in the Spherical Method.  \n\nFigure 39: Fit of the computed ???? for different random radius and the theoretical curve \n\nof ????  to the free space.
