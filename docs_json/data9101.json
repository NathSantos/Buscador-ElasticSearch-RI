Thermodynamic and hydrodynamic characterization of the vacuum \nevaporation process during concentration of dairy products in a falling film \n\nevaporator. Adviser: Ant\u00f4nio Fernandes de Carvalho. Co-advisers: \u00cdtalo Tuler \nPerrone and Pierre Schuck. \n\n \n\nFalling film evaporators (FFE) are widely used in the chemical, refrigeration, \n\npetroleum refining, desalination and food industries. In the dairy industry FFE is \n\napplied for the concentration of solutions prior to the drying step. Despite the \n\neconomic importance of the vacuum evaporation process in the manufacture of dairy \n\ndried products, the knowledge about the process is mostly empirical. Research \n\naiming to improve the efficiency of the process is therefore necessary. The objective \n\nof this PhD project was to characterize experimentally a FFE during the \n\nconcentration of dairy products by means of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic \n\napproaches, in order to study the interactions between the products properties and \n\nthe operating parameters. A pilot-scale, single-stage falling film evaporator that \n\ndescribes the same process as that of an industrial scale from a hydrodynamic point \n\nof view was instrumented and used to establish the mass and energy balances. The \n\nevaporation rate and the overall heat transfer coefficient were calculated from the \n\nexperimental data to follow up the process. A methodology for the determination of \n\nthe experimental residence time distribution (RTD) functions was developed. RTD \n\nfunctions provide global information about the flow of the products during \n\nconcentration in a FFE. Increasing of the concentration of skim milk, mass flow rate \n\nand the distance covered by the product resulted in an increase in the dispersion of \n\n\n\n \n\nxxii \n\n \n\nthe products particles. The experimental RTD functions were modelled by a \n\ncombination of two perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series. From the interpretation of \n\nthis model, two different flows, a main and a minor flow, were identified. The RTD \n\nmethodology developed on skim milk was applied to sweet whey and lactic acid \n\nwhey and the study was extended to the formation of fouling during a 5-hour \n\nconcentration. The mean residence time was more sensitive to identify fouling than \n\nthe overall heat transfer coefficient and the evaporation rate. This study emphasized \n\nthe crucial role of process characterization to improve the performance of FFE and \n\nproduct quality. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nxxiii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\n \n\nSILVEIRA, Arlan Caldas Pereira, D.S., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, outubro de \n2015. Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o termodin\u00e2mica e hidrodin\u00e2mica do processo de \nevapora\u00e7\u00e3o a v\u00e1cuo durante a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos l\u00e1cteos em um \n\nevaporador de pel\u00edcula descendente. Orientador: Ant\u00f4nio Fernandes de Carvalho. \nCoorientadores: \u00cdtalo Tuler Perrone e Pierre Schuck. \n\n \n\n \n\nOs evaporadores de pel\u00edcula descendente (EPD) s\u00e3o amplamente utilizados nas \n\nind\u00fastrias qu\u00edmicas, de refrigera\u00e7\u00e3o, de refino de petr\u00f3leo e de alimentos. Nas \n\nind\u00fastrias de latic\u00ednios, os EPD s\u00e3o mais comumente utilizados para a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde solu\u00e7\u00f5es antes do processo de secagem por spray-dryer. Apesar da import\u00e2ncia \n\necon\u00f4mica do processo de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o a v\u00e1cuo na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos l\u00e1cteos \n\ndesidratados, o conhecimento do processo \u00e9 essencialmente emp\u00edrico. Estudos \n\nvisando a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do processo s\u00e3o portanto necess\u00e1rios. O objetivo deste \n\nprojeto de doutorado \u00e9 o de caracterizar experimentalmente um EPD durante a \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos l\u00e1cteos, utilizando de abordagens termodin\u00e2micas e \n\nhidrodin\u00e2micas afim de se estudar as intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre as propriedades dos produtos \n\ne os param\u00eatros operacionais. Um evaporador de pel\u00edcula descendente, simples \n\nefeito, em escala piloto, que descreve o mesmo processo em escala industrial de \n\num ponto de vista hidrodin\u00e2mico, foi instrumentado e utilizado para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos balan\u00e7os de massa e de energia. A capacidade evaporativa e o coeficiente \n\nglobal de transfer\u00eancia de calor foram calculados a partir dos dados experimentais. \n\nUma metodologia para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o experimental da fun\u00e7\u00e3o de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\ntempos de resid\u00eancia (DTR) foi desenvolvida. As fun\u00e7\u00f5es DTR fornecem \n\n\n\n \n\nxxiv \n\n \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es essenciais sobre o escoamento dos produtos durante a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nem EPD. O aumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o, da vaz\u00e3o m\u00e1ssica e da dist\u00e2ncia percorrida \n\npelo produto, provocam um aumento na dispers\u00e3o das part\u00edculas do fluxo. Estas \n\nfun\u00e7\u00f5es foram modelados por uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de reatores em cascada, \n\nperfeitamente agitados. De acordo com a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o deste modelo, dois fluxos, \n\num prim\u00e1rio e um secund\u00e1rio, correspondendo a duas camadas de produto que \n\nfluem sobrepostas atrav\u00e9s dos tubos de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o, foram propostos. A \n\nmetodologia para o c\u00e1lculo das fun\u00e7\u00f5es DTR foi aplicada a diferentes produtos \n\nl\u00e1cteos (leite desnatado, soro de leite doce e \u00e1cido), e o estudo foi estendido para \n\na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fouling durante a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o por evapora\u00e7\u00e3o a v\u00e1cuo.

With the uneven distribution of milk production at the global level, the expected \n\ngrowth in the world population and the rise in standards of living (in particular in developing \n\ncountries), the dairy market will be confronted with even more massive changes in the next \n\ndecade. The world market for dairy powders is expanding considerably. The investment in \n\nnew vacuum evaporators and spray driers is therefore being reported throughout the world \n\nto secure outlets. The vacuum evaporation process is mainly used in the dairy industry prior \n\nto drying. Moreover the quality of the concentrates influences the final powder quality. \n\nThis context clearly drives researches in order to improve the efficiency and control \n\nof the vacuum evaporation process. However, few research groups are interested in this \n\ntopic. The dairy industry has acquired empirical expertise in the vacuum evaporation \n\nprocess, and the research centers in dairy powder are interested, until then, in drying \n\ntechnology (spray dryer). Study of vacuum concentration of dairy products is therefore a \n\nchallenging for research in food processing engineering. \n\nThe goal of this PhD project was to characterize experimentally a falling film \n\nevaporator during the concentration of dairy products, by means of thermodynamic and \n\nhydrodynamic approaches, in order to study the interactions between the products \n\nproperties and the operating parameters. A prototype pilot-scale, single-stage falling film \n\nevaporator was therefore used to tackle these issues. This equipment was designed to \n\ndescribe the same process as the industrial scale from a hydrodynamic point of view. \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nThis work was therefore divided into three research parts: one on the instrumentation \n\nand characterization of a pilot-scale falling film evaporator, another part on the \n\nhydrodynamic profile of the vacuum evaporation process, and a third part on the application \n\nof the approaches previously developed to other dairy products. \n\nTo state the scientific and economic context of the project, a chapter about the trade \n\ndevelopment of dairy powders and vacuum evaporation research trends (Chapter 1), and a \n\nliterature review on vacuum evaporation process during concentration of dairy products \n\n(Chapter 2) are presented. These chapters are followed by the description of the \n\nexperimental strategy of the PhD project (Chapter 3). The second part of the thesis \n\npresented materials and methods, results and discussion regarding the process of vacuum \n\nevaporation of different dairy products. This includes the description of the pilot-scale single \n\nstage falling film evaporator used in this study (Chapter 4), the thermodynamic and \n\nhydrodynamic characterization of this equipment (Chapter 5, and 6, respectively) and the \n\napplication of these approaches to other dairy products (Chapter 7). Finally, the main \n\ncontributions and potential research opportunities are drawn together in the conclusion and \n\nin the outlook sections. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPART 1 \nECONOMIC AND SCIENTIFIC \n\nCONTEXTS \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nChapter 1 \nTRADE DEVELOPMENT OF DRIED DAIRY PRODUCTS AND \n\nRESEARCH TRENDS \n\nThis chapter introduces the economic background of dairy products, from milk \n\nproduction to powder manufacture.

This information is used to draw conclusions regarding the future trends of dairy \n\npowders. These include the evolution of the dairy product trade and the socio-economic \n\ncontext.

Milk Production \n\n \n\nThe worldwide production of milk is forecast to grow by as much as 2% in 2015, a \n\nrate similar to previous years, and should reach 805 million tons. Asia is expected to account \n\nfor most of the increase, but production is projected to rise in all regions (FAO, 2015). The \n\nmain milk producers are Europe, India, The United States of America, China and Brazil, \n\nwhich have had high production rates over the last 5 years (Fig. 1.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Main milk producers (USDA NASS, 2015). \n\nNote: 2015: forecast. \n\nThe worldwide production of milk should continue to grow in coming years, reaching \n\na level of 880 million tons in 2020 (Fig. 1.2) (OECD-FAO, 2015). \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\nEU India US China Brazil\n\nv\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n o\n\nf \nm\n\nil\nk\n\n p\nro\n\nd\nu\n\nc\ne\n\nd\n (\n\nm\nil\n\nli\no\n\nn\n t\n\no\nn\n\ns\n)\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. Evolution of worldwide production of milk from 2013 to 2020. (2015 to \n\n2020: forecast) (OECD/FAO, 2015). \n\nFrance is the second highest producer of milk in Europe and the seventh in the world, \n\nwith 25.3 million tons of milk per year. In France, about 40% of the milk produced is \n\nprocessed and exported (CNIEL, 2015), product manufacture representing a turnover of \n\n27.2 billion euros and generating about 250,000 jobs (CNIEL, 2015). Dairy products to the \n\nvalue of 6.9 billion euros were exported in 2013, with a trade surplus of 3.6 billion euros, an \n\nincrease of 71% in 10 years. \n\nBrazil is among the five largest producers of milk in the world and has achieved a \n\nsignificant role in the global dairy market. Brazil came from production of 7.3 million tons of \n\nmilk in the 70s to 35 million tons in 2014 (IBGE, 2015). This year the country is expected to \n\nreach the third place as worldwide producer of milk, surpassing Chinese production (FAO, \n\n2015). \n\n \n\n700\n\n720\n\n740\n\n760\n\n780\n\n800\n\n820\n\n840\n\n860\n\n880\n\n900\n\nMilk world production\n\nm\nil\n\nli\no\n\nn\n t\n\no\nn\n\ns\n \n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n1.1.2. World market for dairy powders \n\nThe popularity and increasing range of dairy products and the westernization of diets \n\ncontinue to be key factors driving the worldwide dairy market. Among dairy products, the \n\nglobal milk powder market is expanding considerably (Fig. 1.3), e.g. in France around 19% \n\nof processed milk volume is transformed into different dairy powders (CNIEL, 2015). This is \n\ndue to an increasing demand for milk products from countries with milk shortages, in \n\nparticular emerging countries. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3. Forecasts for worldwide skim milk and whole milk powder production. \n\n2013 and 2014 (estimate), 2015 to 2020 (forecasts) (OECD-FAO, 2015). \n\nLegend: SMP = skim milk powder; WMP = whole milk powder \n\nWith a large domestic market and high levels of milk production, Brazil has a different \n\ndairy market behavior to that in France.

From \n\n2004 to 2008, it was an exporter of dairy products (Fig. 1.4). However, with a growing \n\nconsumption of dairy products, large world supply and depreciation of the dollar, since 2008 \n\nBrazil has again become an importer of dairy products. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4. Trade balance of Brazilian dairy products from 2001 to 2014 (in milk \n\nequivalent) (EMBRAPA, 2010; Milkpoint, 2014). \n\nDue to the country's economic issues and lower GDP growth rate, the consumption \n\nof dairy products in Brazil was slowing in 2014. However, in 2014 Brazil increased its \n\nturnover of dairy exports by 254.3% compared to 2013 (MDCI, 2014) (Table 1.1). The \n\nBrazilian export of dairy products had a favorable scenario in this year. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-1200\n\n-1000\n\n-800\n\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\n\nM\nil\n\nli\no\n\nn\n l\n\nit\ne\n\nrs\n o\n\nf \nm\n\nil\nk\n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nTable 1.1.

The development of filtration technology (microfiltration, ultrafiltration, \n\nnanofiltration and reverse osmosis) has allowed the production of valuable milk protein \n\nfractions (Schuck et al., 2013). Used either as nutritional or functional ingredients, most of \n\nthese proteins are marketed in dehydrated form. In the last ten years, the nature of dairy \n\npowders has changed to more specific intermediate dried products, and powders have been \n\ndeveloped as techno-functional ingredients according to their expected functional properties \n\nsuch as gelation, foaming and emulsification. Many new uses of these constituents have \n\nappeared with the manufacture of formula products, substitutes and adapted raw material. \n\nDairy powders are therefore used in the development of a wide range of products. \n\n1.1.3. French and Brazilian dried dairy product markets \n\nAbout 56% of dairy powders produced in France are exported, mainly to the \n\nEuropean Union, Asia and the Middle East. The French production of milk powders accounts \n\nfor approximately 10% of the total world production (IDF, 2013) (Table 1.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nTable 1.2.

The domestic \n\ndemand for dairy products (mainly milk powders) is expanding, as well as global demand. \n\nDairy powders corresponded to 69.6% of Brazilian dairy imports in 2013, 49.4% being skim \n\nand whole milk powders, 19.6% whey powder and 0.6% infant formulae (MDCI, 2014). \n\n1.1.4. Developments and investments involving concentrated and dried dairy \n\nproducts \n\nInvestment in new spray driers and vacuum evaporators are being reported \n\nthroughout the world to secure outlets. Indeed, investments of more than 2.5 billion euros \n\nare currently predicted for dried dairy products, involving 46 companies, 53 projects and 28 \n\ncountries (CNIEL, 2012). Over the last two years, 400 million euros of investment were \n\nannounced or implemented on French territory to produce milk or whey powders (CNIEL, \n\n2015).

Investments of more than 100 million US$ announced and/or finalized in \n\nEurope (A) and America (B) (CNIEL, 2015; IDF, 2013). \n\nA combination of newly developing markets for dairy products, particularly in South-\n\nEast Asia, and the emergence of new entrant countries with rapidly expanding milk \n\nproduction are changing the dynamics of the world dairy industry. With a projected increase \n\nin world milk production, it is to be expected that dairy powders will continue to play an \n\nimportant role in facilitating trade of milk solids on an international scale. Vacuum \n\nevaporation and spray drying along with existing and novel techniques will continue to be \n\nimportant contributors to ingredient innovation.

Worldwide research involving \u201cfalling film vacuum evaporators\u201d \n\nEvaporation is the most often used technique in the food industry for concentrating \n\nsolutions or crystallizing solids from solutions. Of all the existing technology for evaporation \n\nof a solution in dairy industries, the falling film evaporator is currently the most frequently \n\nused, mainly due to its ability to treat heat-sensitive products. \n\nConsidering the economic importance of vacuum evaporation in the production of \n\nconcentrated / dehydrated dairy products, research aiming to improve the efficiency of the \n\nprocess is necessary. However, few research groups are interested in this topic (Fig. 1.6). \n\nThe dairy industry has acquired empirical expertise in the vacuum evaporation process, and \n\nthe research centers in dairy powder are interested, until then, in drying technology (spray \n\ndryer). Study of vacuum concentration in dairy products is therefore a challenging and a \n\nfertile area for research in food processing engineering. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6.

Transformation of milk to concentrated dairy products \n\n2.1.1.   Classification, composition and structure of milk \n\nMilk is a fluid secreted by mammalian females in order to satisfy the nutritional \n\nrequirements of their neonates. It constitutes, therefore, a source of energy provided by \n\nlipids, lactose, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and water. It also has an important \n\nphysiological role as it contains enzymes, hormones, antibacterial compounds, proteins and \n\npeptides (Fox and McSweeney, 2003). A wide range of factors can intervene in the \n\ncomposition of milk such as race, stage of lactation, health of the animal, season, animal \n\nfeeding, etc. (Mahaut et al., 2000). Table 2.1 shows the average composition of bovine milk. \n\nTable 2.1. Average composition of bovine milk (Walstra et al., 1999). \n\nComponent \nAverage concentration \n\n(g\u00b7kg-1) \n\nWater 871.0 \n\nFat 40.0 \n\nProteins 32.5 \n\n     Caseins 26.0 \n\n     Whey proteins 6.0 \n\nLactose 46.0 \n\nMinerals 7.0 \n\nOrganic acids 1.7 \n\nOthers 1.5 \n\n \n\nThe average pH value of bovine milk at 20\u00b0C is about 6.6 - 6.8. The substances \n\ndissolved in milk provide an average water activity of 0.995. Milk density (around 1029 kg\u00b7m\u00b3 \n\nat 20 \u00b0C) varies mainly due to the fat content. Although its viscosity is twice that of water, it \n\nbehaves as a Newtonian fluid (Walstra et al., 2006). \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nThe nitrogen content of milk is about 34.0 g\u00b7kg-1, divided into three groups: caseins, \n\nwhey proteins and non-protein nitrogen. Casein and whey proteins differ according to their \n\nsolubility at pH 4.6 (Croguennec et al., 2008). \n\nCasein represents 80% of the total milk proteins (Cayot and Lorient, 1998; Fox and \n\nBrodkorb, 2008; Horne, 2003). Casein in milk exists as large colloidal particles called \u201ccasein \n\nmicelles\u201d (Fox and Brodkorb, 2008). Casein micelles have a relatively wide size distribution, \n\nfrom less than 50 nm to more than 500 nm, with an average diameter of approximately 200 \n\nnm (Horne, 2003). In their native state, casein micelles are hydrated particles containing \n\nseveral thousand ?S1-, ?S2-, ?- and ?-casein molecules as well as minerals, mainly colloidal \n\ncalcium phosphate (CCP) (de Kruif, 1999; Panouill\u00e9 et al., 2005). In milk at pH 6.7, casein \n\nmicelles are electronegative, with an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.7. Caseins in the micelle \n\nstructure are held together by hydrophobic interactions and by the presence of CCP. In \n\nphysiological conditions, a \u201chairy layer\u201d of the hydrophilic parts of ?-casein (about 10 nm \n\nthick and located at the surface of casein micelles) is responsible for steric and electro-\n\nrepulsive stabilization of casein micelles, thus producing a balanced colloidal system \n\n(Panouill\u00e9 et al., 2005). \n\nIn contrast to caseins, whey proteins are soluble at pH 4.6 in their native form. These \n\nproteins are heat-sensitive. The major whey protein constituents are ?-lactoglobulin (?-lg) \n\nand ?-lactoglobulin (? -lg). ?-lg is a globular protein with a molecular mass of 18.3 kDa that \n\nhas a very compact structure due to the presence of many ? sheets. In milk at pH 6.7, ?-lg \n\nis in the form of a dimer held together by non-covalent interactions. This protein has a free \n\nsulfhydryl group that is not accessible in the native form of the protein. ?-la is a compact \n\nglobular protein with a molecular weight of 14.2 kDa. This protein has an excellent amino \n\nacid profile, being rich in lysine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan and cystine (Kinsella and \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nWhitehead, 1989). Other minor whey proteins are also present in the soluble phase of milk, \n\nin particular bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulins and lactoferrin. \n\nTable 2.2.

Fig. 2.1 (a) shows a transmission \n\nelectron microscopy image of raw milk at room temperature in which these three phases \n\ncan be identified: the lipid phase bounded by a membrane (milk fat globule membrane), \n\ncasein micelles in suspension and the aqueous phase. The diameter of milk fat globules is \n\nbetween 0.1 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m. The average diameter of the fat globules (about 7 \u00b5m) is much \n\nlarger than that of casein micelles (~ 120 nm) as shown in Fig. 2.1. Fig. 2.1 (b) shows the \n\ncasein micelles (dark grey) and aqueous phase (light grey). \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Raw milk at ambient temperature observed by transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy, (a) where fat is present  and (b) in the absence of fat (Tamine et al., 2007). \n\nThe ability of milk to be processed into a variety of products is mainly due to the \n\nphysicochemical characteristics of its proteins that confer various tecnofunctional properties \n\n(gelling, foaming, emulsifying, etc.) (Croguennec et al., 2008). Finally, milk is a system under \n\ndynamic equilibrium and several changes may occur on modifying its composition and \n\nstructure. These changes may be physical (foaming), chemical (oxidation, lipolysis, \n\nproteolysis) and microbial (production of acid lactic). \n\n2.1.2.   Cracking of milk \n\nMilk is a constituent of many food products. If the milk components are available \n\nseparately a wider range of functionalities properties such as foaming, emulsifying, etc., can \n\nbe used for new applications. Fractionated milk components provide a more constant quality \n\nof consumer products and the development of new products, such as bio-active peptides. \n\nMilk fractionation therefore leads to a more efficient and diverse use of milk. Furthermore, \n\nworking with concentrated streams may reduce the cost of transport significantly and also \n\nhave environmental advantages. Membrane separation technology seems a logical choice \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nfor the fractionation of milk, because many milk components can be separated on size (Fig. \n\n2.2). Membranes are already well established for the processing of whey and are gaining \n\npopularity in other dairy applications (Daufin et al., 2001). These processes lead to the \n\nfractionation of dairy components, i.e. the \u201ccracking\u201d of milk (Fig. 2.3) and whey (Fig. 2.4). \n\nProgress is still being made on the extent of fractionation of milk and whey using more \n\nspecific combinations of membrane filtration and other separation techniques \n\n(electrodialysis, ion exchange, and chromatography) and/or chemical treatments (such as \n\nacidification or hydrolysis). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2.

Vacuum evaporation \n\nEvaporation is a process used to remove a liquid from a solution, suspension, or \n\nemulsion by boiling off some of the liquid. It is thus a thermal separation or thermal \n\nconcentration process. The evaporation process is defined as one that starts with a liquid \n\nproduct and ends up with a more concentrated, but still liquid and still pumped concentrate \n\nas the main product from the process (Kessler, 1981). There are in fact a few instances \n\nwhere the evaporated, volatile component, is the main product, but these are not discussed \n\nin this work. In the food domain evaporation is used for product concentration, volume \n\nreduction, water / solvent recovery and crystallization (Bimbenet et al., 2007). \n\nIn the field of thermal separation / concentration technology, evaporation plants are \n\nwidely used for concentration of liquids in the form of solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. \n\nThe major requirement in the field of evaporation technology is to maintain the quality of the \n\nliquid during evaporation and to avoid damage to the product. This may require the liquid to \n\nbe exposed to the lowest possible boiling temperature for the shortest period of time. In the \n\nfood industry evaporation is performed at absolute pressures in the order of 0.02 MPa to \n\n0.09 MPa (pressures below atmospheric pressure). The term \"vacuum\" is therefore used to \n\nclassify this process. \n\nIn the dairy industry, vacuum evaporation is a process used for the production of final \n\n(sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, etc.) (G\u00e4nzle et al., 2008), and intermediate \n\nproducts before any further operations such as crystallization, precipitation, coagulation or \n\ndrying (infant formulae, whey and milk powders, etc.) (Bimbenet et al., 2007; Schuck, 2002; \n\nZhu et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n2.2.1.   Evaporators \n\nAn evaporator is the device or set of devices used to achieve evaporation. The \n\ndestination of the vapor emitted is essential in the study of an evaporator. Even if there is \n\nno potential use, it is necessary to condense such vapor. The vapor to be condensed is \n\ngenerally used to heat the incoming products. This preheating serves to improve the energy \n\nuse, and the functional operation of the evaporator, since the liquid enters the evaporator at \n\na temperature close to its boiling temperature (Jeantet et al., 2011). \n\nFor vacuum evaporators, the vapor emitted is aspirated into the condenser by a \n\ncondenser pressure (Pc) lower than the evaporation pressure (Pev). Pc is controlled by the \n\nliquid-vapor equilibrium that exists within the condenser. This means that the lowest \n\npressure that can be obtained in an evaporator is imposed by the temperature of the \n\ncondensation of the product vapor in the condenser. The vacuum pump connected to the \n\ncondenser is only responsible for evacuating the air out of the plant and for removing the \n\nincondensable gases. The amount of gases to be evacuated depends on the amount of gas \n\ndissolved in the product and especially of the quality of the vacuum tightness of the system \n\n(including pipes, pump seals, etc.) (Bimbenet et al., 2007). \n\nThere are two main types of condenser (Fig. 2.6): mixture condensers (the vapor \n\nemitted is cooled by mixing with cold water) and wall exchange condensers (tubular heat \n\nexchanger) (Kessler, 1981). The vapor can also be condensed by mechanical refrigeration \n\n(as in lyophilization) but this very expensive technology is justified only in special cases, i.e. \n\nflavor recovery in coffee (Bimbenet et al., 2007). \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6. Diagram of: (A) mixture condensers, and (B) wall exchange condenser. \n\nWhile the design criteria for evaporators are the same regardless of the industry \n\ninvolved, two questions always exist: is this equipment best suited for the purpose and is \n\nthe equipment arranged in the most efficient and economical way? As a result, many types \n\nof evaporator and many variations in processing techniques have been developed to take \n\ninto account different product characteristics and operating parameters. The most common \n\ntypes of evaporators used currently are: \n\n? Rising film evaporators \n? Forced circulation evaporators \n? Plate evaporators \n? Falling film evaporators \n\nOther types of evaporator, include the inclined tube evaporator, forced-circulation \n\nevaporator, wiped film evaporator, etc. (Leleu, 1992). \n\nIncondensable gases \n\nCondensates \n\nCooling water \n\nA B \n\nInlet water \n\nOutlet water \n\nVapeur \n\nCondensates \n\nVacuum \npump \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n2.2.1.1.  Rising film evaporators \n\nThese evaporators operate on a \"thermo-siphon\" principle. Feed enters at the bottom \n\nof the heating tubes and as it heats, vapor begins to form (Fig. 2.7). The ascending force of \n\nthis vapor produced during boiling causes liquid to flow upwards. At the same time vapor \n\nproduction increases and the product is pressed as a thin film on the walls of the tubes \n\n(Smith and Hui, 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7. Rising Film Evaporator (www.niroinc.com). \n\nThis co-current upward movement has the beneficial effect of creating a high degree \n\nof turbulence in the liquid. This is advantageous during evaporation of highly viscous \n\nproducts. A large temperature difference is need between the heating and boiling sides of \n\nthis type of evaporator, otherwise the energy of the vapor flow is not sufficient to convey the \n\nliquid and to produce the rising film. The length of the boiling tubes will typically not exceed \n\n7 meters. This type of evaporator is often used with product recirculation, where some of the \n\nA: Product \n\nB: Vapor \n\nC: Concentrate \n\nD: Heating Steam \n\nE: Condensate \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nconcentrate formed is reintroduced back to the feed inlet in order to produce sufficient liquid \n\nloading inside the boiling tubes. \n\n2.2.1.2.  Forced circulation evaporator \n\nForced circulation evaporators (Fig. 2.8) are used if boiling of the product on the \n\nheating surfaces is to be avoided due to fouling or crystallization. The flow velocity in the \n\ntubes must be high, and high-capacity pumps are required. The circulating liquid is heated \n\nwhen it flows through the heat exchanger and then partially evaporated when the pressure \n\nis reduced in the separator, cooling the liquid to the boiling temperature (Smith and Hui, \n\n2008). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8. Forced circulation evaporator (www.niroinc.com). \n\nThe liquid is typically only heated a few degrees for each pass through the heat \n\nexchanger, which means the recirculation flow rate has to be high. This type of evaporator \n\nis also used for crystallizing applications because no evaporation and concentration take \n\nplace on the heat transfer surface. Evaporation occurs as the liquid is flash evaporated in \n\nA: Product \n\nB: Vapor \n\nC: Concentrate \n\nD: Heating \n\nE: Condensate \n\n1: Calandria \n\n2: Separator (Flash Cooler) \n\n3: Circulation Pump \n\n4: Concentrate Pump \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nthe separator / flash vessel. In crystallizing applications this is then where the crystals form, \n\nand special separator designs are used to separate crystals from the recirculated crystal \n\nslurry. The heat exchanger can be arranged either horizontally or vertically depending on \n\nthe specific requirements in each case. \n\n2.2.1.3.  Falling film evaporators \n\nThe need, for an evaporator capable of functioning with a very small temperature \n\ndifference between heat steam and product, imposed by shorter process times and \n\noperating economy led to the application of the falling film evaporation principle (Gray, 1981). \n\nWith this arrangement the product is made to flow downwards in a film over the heating \n\nsurface. The principal driving force is gravity. In contrast to the climbing film evaporators, \n\nhigh heat fluxes and temperature differences are not required to establish the desired flow \n\nconditions. The heat transfer surface may be in the form of either tubes or plates, but \n\ncapacity limitations of the falling film plate evaporator have led to the tubular version being \n\nmuch more widely applied (Gray, 1981). The falling film tubular evaporator is currently the \n\nstandard type used in the dairy industry. \n\nIn falling film evaporators (FFE) (Fig. 2.9), liquid and vapors flow downwards in \n\nparallel. The liquid to be concentrated is preheated to boiling temperature. An even thin film \n\nenters the heating tubes via a distributor system in the head of the evaporator, flows \n\ndownward at boiling temperature, and is partially evaporated. This gravity-induced \n\ndownward movement is increasingly augmented by the co-current vapor flow. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9. Falling film evaporator. Addapted from Jeantet et al. (2011). \n\nHowever, falling film evaporators must be designed very carefully for each operating \n\ncondition; sufficient wetting of the heating surface by liquid is extremely important for trouble-\n\nfree operation of the plant (Morison et al., 2006). Due the low liquid holding volume in this \n\ntype of unit, the falling film evaporator can be started up quickly and changed to cleaning \n\nmode or another product easily. The fact that falling film evaporators can be operated with \n\nsmall temperature differences makes it possible to use them in multiple effect configurations \n\nwith very low energy consumption. \n\nEvaporation \ntubes \n\nCooling \nwater \n\nIncondensible gases \n\nCondenser \n\nSteam \n\nCondensates \n\nConcentrate \n\nSeparator \n\nSecondary \nvapor Condensates \n\nVacuum pump \n\nProduct \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n2.2.2.   Energy efficiency \n\nTo become even more energy efficient the vapor produced in one falling film \n\nevaporator can be used to heat another evaporator operating at a lower pressure and \n\ntemperature. The first evaporator thus acts as a \"boiler\" for the second. Similarly, the second \n\nserves as a condenser for the first (Fig. 2.10). This way of recycling the water vapor \n\ncontinuously in series is often termed multi-effect evaporation. With n evaporators added in \n\nseries to recycle the water vapor for use in the next evaporator, the energy usage can be \n\ndecreased by approximately 1/neffects. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10. Multi-effect evaporator (Jeantet et al., 2011). \n\nThe economic optimization of the number of effects is chosen for a minimum total \n\ncost of the evaporation process.

This parameter cannot be considered as an intrinsic \n\ncharacteristic of the evaporator, since it also depends on the nature of the product and on \n\ntheir flow conditions (Mafart, 1991). The factors that control heat transfer in the evaporator \n\ntubes are important for close monitoring of the evaporation process and for the calculation \n\nof the evaporators dimensions (Bouman et al., 1993; Jebson and Iyer, 1991). \n\nNumber of effects \n\nCost \n\nSC \n\nCC \n\nIC \n\nTC \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n2.2.2.1.  Heat transfer coefficient \n\nKnowing the heat transfer coefficient is essential to monitor the evaporation process \n\nclosely. In most dairy factories the total energy usage is known, but often information on the \n\nquantities of energy used for individual processes is lacking (Jebson and Chen, 1997). \n\nFor all types of evaporator, the evaporation rate depends on the heating power (Q?), \nwhich depends on the overall heat transfer coefficient (U), the heat exchange area (A), and \n\nthe temperature difference between the heating steam and the boiling liquid, ??, Eq. 2.1: \n\nQ? = ? \u00b7  A \u00b7 ?? Eq. 2.1 \nThe design, optimization and investment costs of the unit are thus strongly \n\ndependent on the predicted value of this variable (Prost et al., 2006). \n\nThe inverse overall heat transfer coefficient (1/U) for a given effect is resistance \n\nresulting from four resistances in series: the resistance of the heating steam side (1/hv), the \n\nresistance of conduction through the wall (em/?m), the resistance of an eventual fouling layer \n\n(Rfouling) and the resistance of the product (1/hp) (Fig. 2.12, Eq. 2.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12.

These coefficients are generally high, in the order of 10 \n\nkW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 to 20 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1, which corresponds to a low thermal resistance, that can often \n\nbe disregarded. \n\nThe potential fouling layer must be taken into account in the calculation of the overall \n\nheat transfer coefficient. Fouling of heat transfer surfaces is one of greater problems in heat \n\ntransfer equipment. \n\nGenerally the product heat transfer coefficient, hp, is the most difficult to predict, and \n\noften it is the limiting factor for the heat transfer, especially for viscous concentrates. The \n\nheat transfer coefficient for pure water evaporated at ?? = 10\u00b0C is in the order of 6 kW\u00b7m-\n\n2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 to 15 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1. According to many authors (Bimbenet et al., 2007; Miranda and \n\nSimpson, 2005; etc.), hp depends on several factors such as physical properties of the \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\ntreated product (viscosity ?p, surface tension jp, density ?p, etc.); process conditions (heat \n\nflux, temperature difference ??, boiling temperature ?p); and nature and geometry of the \n\nheating surface, (roughness R, etc.). These factors are summarized in Eq. 2.5. \n\nh? = f???, ??, ??, C?? \u2026 ??, R, etc. ?

For falling film evaporators this coefficient are in order of 1 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 to 8 kW\u00b7m-\n\n2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 (Bimbenet et al., 2007). \n\n2.3.   Thermo-physical properties of dairy concentrates \n\nEstimation of U in all chemical engineering formulas currently available in the \n\nliterature is connected to thermo-physical properties of products. These thermo-physical \n\nproperties (?p, ?p, ?p ...) generally vary with the concentration and temperature of the product, \n\nand possibly also as a function of shear rate in the case of a non-Newtonian fluid. \n\n2.3.1.   Viscosity of dairy concentrates \n\nThe rheological behavior of dairy concentrates changes during the evaporation \n\nprocess due the changes in the product concentration and temperature. It can be modified \n\nby the shear rate, expressed by the velocity gradient, ?? (s-1): \n ?? = ???? Eq. 2.6 \nTherefore the apparent viscosity, ?a, is used to represent and classify the flow profile \n\nof dairy concentrates. This defined as: \n\n?? = ??? Eq. 2.7 \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the shear stress (Pa) \nAccording to the relationship between the shear stress and the shear rate presented \n\nin Eq. 2.7, two types of rheological behavior can be distinguished (Fig. 2.13). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. \n\nFor Newtonian fluid the viscosity only depends on the temperature and concentration. \n\nOn the other hand for the Non-Newtonian fluids the viscosity depends on the shear rate in \n\naddition to the temperature and concentration. \n\n2.3.2.  Thermal properties of dairy concentrates \n\nSome thermal properties of dairy concentrates can be used for the estimation of heat \n\ntransfer coefficients and enthalpy balances for an evaporator. These properties are: \n\n\u2022 Specific heat Cp (kJ\u00b7kg-1\u00b7\u00b0C-1) \n\nShear thinning \n\nNewtonian \n\nDilatants \n\nNon-Newtonian \n\n?

For \n\na solution composed of sugars, salts, proteins and lipids, such as dairy concentrates, the \n\nspecific enthalpy can be calculated according to Rahman, 2009: \n\nH? = C? ? ?? Eq. 2.9 \nThe specific enthalpy of the water vapor emitted at temperature ?p of the concentrate \n\nis given by the following equation: \n\nH??? = ?.?? ? ???? + ?H? Eq. 2.10 \n\u2022 Enthalpy of vaporization: ?Hv (kJ\u00b7kg-1) \n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization, also known as the latent heat of vaporization or heat \n\nof evaporation, is the energy required to transform a given quantity of a substance from a \n\nliquid into a gas at a given pressure. For example the ?HV for pure water at 100\u00b0C = 2258 \n\nkJ\u00b7kg-1. \n\nFor a food product, the binding of water on the solute will result in a boiling point \n\nelevation, i.e. a saccharose solution at 700 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids has a boiling point elevation \n\naround 2.7\u00b0C when concentrated at 80\u00b0C (Bimbenet et al., 2007). \n\n\u2022 Thermal conductivity ? (W\u00b7m-1\u00b7\u00b0C-1): \n\nThermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat. It can be defined \n\nas the quantity of heat transmitted through a unit thickness of a material - in a direction \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nnormal to a surface of unit area - due to a unit temperature gradient under steady state \n\nconditions. The skim and whole milk thermal conductivity is around 0.563\u00b710-3 kW\u00b7m-1\u00b7\u00b0C-1 \n\nand 0.537\u00b710-3 kW\u00b7m-1\u00b7\u00b0C-1, respectively. \n\n \n\n2.4.   Flow in falling film evaporators \n\nIn FFE a complete film should be maintained inside the tubes over the process time. \n\nThis requires that the liquid is first distributed to all the tubes to provide sufficient flow. The \n\nfilm must then be maintained down the tubes. Film breakdown (Fig. 2.14) will decrease the \n\nefficiency of the process and may cause excessive fouling (Paramalingam et al., 2000). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.14. Film breakdown (Hartley and Murgatroyd, 1964; Morison et al., 2006). \n\nIn an industrial evaporator a distributor system is installed above the top tube sheet. \n\nA falling-film distributor (Fig. 2.15) is a critical component in the evaporator, which makes \n\nthe liquid flow evenly inside the tube and affects the production capacity and service life of \n\nthe evaporator. Unfortunately, industrial liquid film distributors have certain shortcomings, \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nsuch as structural complexity, large area, high requirement for production and processing \n\nprecision, poor uniformity and wettability of falling film (Anurjew et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15. Plan of a typical distributor system for a falling film evaporator tube \n\n(www.gea.com). \n\nThe flow in falling film evaporators is often characterized by using dimensionless \n\nnumbers. The most important parameter is the film Reynolds number (Ref), which measures \n\nthe extent of the inertia relative to viscous effects. \n\nRe? = ? ?? Eq. 2.11 \nwhere ? is the mass flow rate per unit circumference of the tube (kg\u00b7m-1\u00b7s-1) and ? \n\nthe apparent viscosity of the product (Pa\u00b7s). \n\n? is measured according to equation 2.12: \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n? = ???? Eq. 2.12 \nwhere m? is the concentrate mass flow rate (kg\u00b7s-1) and D the inner diameter of the \n\ntube (m). \n\nThere are many different classifications of falling film flows in the literature. \n\nGrossman and Heath (1984) divided the flow into three regimes, smooth laminar, transition \n\nregion and fully turbulent flow, where the transition region can in turn be divided into different \n\nregions. Numrich (1992) divided the flow into only two regions, the laminar and the turbulent. \n\nBird et al. (1960) established the flow profiles in three regions: laminar, laminar with waves \n\nand turbulent. What varies between these different classifications is how the transition from \n\nlaminar to turbulent flow is handled. \n\n2.4.1.  Residence time distribution functions \n\nThe residence time distribution (RTD) of fluids passing through a food processing \n\nplant can be important for public safety and product quality reasons. It is often assumed for \n\ndesign purposes that either a laminar or plug flow regime exists and that the residence times \n\ncan be calculated from volume and flow rate (Janssen, 1994). Moreover, in falling film \n\nevaporators the product flows in a thin layer in the evaporations tubes, thus making it difficult, \n\nto determine plant volume accurately. For such situations, it is necessary to measure the \n\nplant RTD directly. \n\nThe mathematics and techniques for RTD determination were developed in the field \n\nof chemical engineering (Danckwerts, 1953). The most common technique is injecting an \n\ninert tracer into the feed stream and measuring the concentration in the product stream over \n\ntime (Fig. 2.16). \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.16. Diagram of measurement of tracer for calculation of residence time \ndistribution. \n\nEach element of fluid takes a different route and time through the processing unit. \n\nThe distribution of these times at the outlet of the unit is called the E-curve or age distribution \n\nfunction, E(t), which characterizes the residence time distribution (RTD) of the process. The \n\nsimplest way to obtain the E(t) is by the pulse experiment, where a small amount of a non-\n\nreactive tracer is injected simultaneously at the unit inlet and its concentration is \n\ncontinuously recorded at the outlet C(t) (Fig. 2.16). The E-curve is then obtained from Eq. \n\n(2.13), where C0 is the total tracer concentration (Levenspiel, 1999). \n\nE?t? = ???????? ??????? ????  Eq. 2.13 \n? E?t?dt = ???  Eq. 2.14 \nSince the pioneering work of Danckwerts (1953), the RTD theory has been widely \n\ndeveloped and is nowadays used in a more general context in order to determine a \n\npopulation balance model (Villermaux, 1982), where the basis of this model is that the \n\nnumber of entities with certain properties in a system is a balanceable quantity. Such \n\nproperties include size, mass, and age. RTD theory is also used to optimize the process in \n\nterms of capital and operation costs (Malcata, 1991). The latter represent an essential step \n\nin managing and controlling the quality of food products. Burton et al., (1959) applied the \n\nconcept of RTD to food engineering in order to calculate the sterilizing effectiveness of a \n\nTracer injection \n\nEvaporator \n\nTracer measured \n(Inlet) \n\nTracer measured \n(Outlet) \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nUHT apparatus for milk processing. Baloh (1979) showed that the loss of sugar in \n\npasteurization and evaporation processes of various processing schemes in the sugar \n\nindustry could be significantly lowered by reducing the mean residence time of sweet juice. \n\nThor and Loncin (1978) established the mechanisms of rinsing (e.g. mass flow rate and \n\nshear stress) of a plate heat exchanger by the measurement of RTD, and thereby laid down \n\nthe basis for optimizing the rinsing of equipment in food engineering. Jeantet et al. (2008) \n\ncalculated and modeled the RTD for different sections of a spray-dryer tower for skim milk, \n\nand described the heat treatment that the product was subjected in this process. \n\nFor tube flow, the RTD is associated with the velocity profile and the dispersion flow \n\nof the product. Determination of the product RTD is an overall and experimental approach \n\nwhich provides valuable information about the product flow profile in the evaporator, \n\naccording to the operating conditions. It does not provide a good physical understanding of \n\nthe operation as computational fluid dynamics does but it integrates the product and process \n\ncomplexity fully. \n\n2.4.2.  Residence time distribution models \n\nIdeal flow models such as plug flow, and perfectly mixed tank and laminar flow rarely \n\nreflect a real system with enough accuracy. Non-ideal models are usually derived from ideal \n\nmodels to account for deviations implicit in real systems (Torres and Oliveira, 1998). Models \n\nwith one parameter, such as the well-known dispersion model, are usually more appropriate \n\nto represent tubular systems (Levenspiel and Bischoff, 1963). In this section, two single \n\nparameter models are presented which have mainly been used to fit the experimental RTD \n\ndata for food reactors. The dimensionless E-curves of these models are illustrated in Fig. \n\n2.16 and 2.17, where the effects of the model parameter can be observed. \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\n2.4.2.1. Axial dispersion \n\nThe axial dispersion model can be used to represent small deviations from plug flow, \n\nas well as other non-ideal flow patterns in tubular systems. It has been widely applied to \n\ndescribe the flow in tubes and is the most frequent choice to model flow in holding tubes in \n\naseptic processing (Torres and Oliveira, 1998). The model parameter is the Peclet number, \n\nwhich is defined for tube flow as: \n\nP? = L ? ??a? Eq. 2.15 \nwhere L is the tube length (m), ? the mean velocity (m\u00b7s-1) and Dax the axial diffusion \n\ncoefficient (-) \n\nThis dimensionless number represents the relation between advection (flow) and \n\ndiffusion. When Pe approaches infinity, negligible dispersion is observed (ideal plug flow). \n\nWhen Pe approaches zero, wide dispersion is observed (perfectly mixed tank) (Fig. 2.17). \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.17.

Fouling in falling film evaporators \n\nFouling is defined as the formation of deposits from the product on heat exchange \n\nsurfaces which impede the heat transfer. In FFE a fouling layer accumulates on the inner \n\nwall of the evaporator tubes during processing (Jeurnink et al., 1996) leading to a decrease \n\nin the heat transfer coefficient, increased pressure drop, and the formation of a biofilm, thus \n\nimpeding the optimal functioning of the evaporator equipment (Langeveld et al., 1990; Visser \n\nand Jeurnink, 1997). \n\nDue to fouling that decreases the heat transfer coefficient, most evaporators do not \n\nhave a constant production capacity. In petrochemical industries, pipe cleaning is carried \n\nout once a year, whereas in food-processing industries, it has to be done at least once a \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nday (Ozden and Puri, 2010). The high frequency of cleaning periods results in a shorter \n\nproduction time and higher consumption of water and cleaning agents, leading to high \n\neconomic costs and ecological problems (Jimenez et al., 2013). \n\nMilk fouling can be classified in two categories (Burton et al., 1959; Changani et al., \n\n1997; Visser and Jeurnink, 1997): Type A (protein) where fouling takes place at \n\ntemperatures between 75\u00b0C and 110\u00b0C, and the deposits are white, soft, and spongy (milk \n\nfilm); and type B (mineral) where fouling takes place at temperatures above 110\u00b0C. Type B \n\ndeposits are hard, compact, granular in structure, and gray in color (milk stone) (Table 2.4). \n\nTable 2.4. Composition of the two milk fouling categories (modified from Bansal and \n\nChen, 2005). \n\nComposition \nMilk fouling  category \n\nType A Type B \n\nProteins (g\u00b7kg-1) 500 to 700 150 to 200 \nMinerals (g\u00b7kg-1) 300 to 400 700 to 800 \n\nFat (g\u00b7kg-1) 40 to 80 40 to 80 \n\n \n\nVacuum evaporators can be considered as heat exchangers in a first approach, \n\nwhere the main mechanism factors likely to generate fouling during the heat treatment of \n\nmilk are: the formation and subsequent deposition of activated whey protein molecules; the \n\nprecipitation of minerals as a result of the decreasing solubility of calcium phosphates with \n\nincreasing temperature; and the temperature difference between the heating surface and \n\nthe liquid to be heated (Lalande and Tissier, 1985; Paterson, 1988). \n\nDuring heat treatment, fouling is particularly problematic with concentrated products. \n\nSchraml and Kessler (1994), found that fouling during pasteurization of whey products \n\nincreased to a maximum concentration of 250 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids (TS), after which \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\ndeposition decreased. The decrease was thought to result from two competing mechanisms: \n\naggregation of whey proteins and crystallization of salts (Fryer et al., 2011). \n\nIn general, the ability to transfer heat efficiently remains a central feature in the \n\nproduction of dairy products. Much attention has therefore been paid to improving the \n\nunderstanding of heat transfer mechanisms and the development of suitable correlations \n\nand techniques that may be applied to the design of vacuum evaporation. On the other hand, \n\nrelatively little consideration has been given to the problem of surface fouling in FFE. Most \n\nof studies of the fouling and cleaning in the food engineering domain have focused on \n\npasteurization and sterilization processes, where the temperatures are higher than 70\u00b0C. \n\nChen and Bala (1998) showed that surface temperatures need to be above 70\u00b0C for \n\nsignificant surface fouling of milk to occur, but most milk evaporators parts operate below \n\nthis temperature (Morison, 2015). Therefore, most of the fouling occurring in milk \n\nevaporators should not be assumed to be the same as that occurring in sterilizers and \n\npasteurizers. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nChapter 3 \nAIMS AND STRATEGY OF THE PHD PROJECT \n\nThis chapter describes the aims and the strategy of this PhD project. Based on the \n\nprogress in dairy powder technology, and the importance of the vacuum evaporation \n\nprocess in terms of energy consumption and final powder quality, this part sets out the \n\nresearch area and outlines the research questions of the project. This study focused mainly \n\non the performance of falling film evaporators during concentration of different dairy products, \n\nincluding skim milk, whole milk, sweet whey and lactic acid whey, at different concentrations. \n\nThe innovative aspect of this project is the use of a pilot-scale, single-stage falling film \n\nevaporator that describes the same process as that of an industrial scale from a \n\nhydrodynamic point of view, and the development of a methodology for the calculation and \n\nmodeling of the residence time distribution functions. The effectiveness of evaporation, the \n\nheat transfer coefficient, the extent of fouling formation, the flow behavior and the dispersion \n\nof the residence time could thus be identified over the processing time.

Context of the PhD project \n\nThe vacuum evaporation process has an important role in the economic aspects of \n\nthe world market for dairy powders, which has been considerably expanding as previously \n\nstated (Fig. 1.3). Indeed, this process is quasi systematically applied in the dairy industry for \n\nthe concentration of solutions prior to the drying step: dairy products must be concentrated \n\nto a maximum total solids content around 500 g\u00b7kg-1 to 550 g\u00b7kg-1, 550 g\u00b7kg-1 to 600 g\u00b7kg-1, \n\nand 200 g\u00b7kg-1 to 250 g\u00b7kg-1 for skim milk, whey and whey protein isolates, respectively, as \n\nbelow this value the concentrated product cannot be atomized in the spray-dryer (Schuck, \n\n2002). Besides, the energy used in multi stage evaporators is about 10 times less than that \n\nused in a spray-dryer, and evaporation is therefore used to remove the maximum amount \n\nof water from the product, while maintaining the physicochemical and microbiological quality \n\nof the liquid.  \n\nThe evaporation process has a major influence on the final powder quality, e.g. an \n\nincrease in the concentrate viscosity will lead to a decrease in the powder bulk density, and \n\nan increase in powder solubility, porosity and wettability, etc. (Fergusson, 1989). However \n\nthe increase of the concentrate viscosity leads to an increase in the powder bulk density \n\naccording to Minton (1986). The milk powders properties is also affected by the thermal heat \n\ntreatment during the evaporation process, as in the spray dryer the thermal effects on the \n\nproduct can be disregarded due to the very low residence time and temperature. The \n\nevaporation process can also cause issues with microbiological powder quality, since \n\nthermoduric bacteria tend to grow during the vacuum evaporation process (Crossley and \n\nCampling, 1957; Murphy et al., 1999). \n\nThe control of vacuum evaporators operation is still a challenge due to the complexity \n\nof their closed geometry and process - product interactions (e.g. fouling of tubes). The dairy \n\nindustry already knows the key operating parameters which must be controlled to obtain a \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nconcentrate with a specific composition and how to identify irregularities in the production \n\nline (e.g. fouling in the evaporation tubes). However, this knowledge is usually obtained \n\nempirically, and therefore there is a lack of information regarding the energy consumption \n\nof the vacuum evaporation process, the product flow profile during concentration, the optimal \n\neffectiveness of evaporation and which operating parameters need to be monitored to obtain \n\nfinal products of controlled composition. This is why a better understanding of the \n\nthermodynamic and hydrodynamic phenomena is needed to determine which operating \n\nparameters need to be monitored to improve the performance of evaporators and to control \n\nthe final properties of the concentrates. Finally, it appears necessary to improve \n\nunderstanding of the effects of the interaction of the product and operating parameters on \n\nthe performance of falling film evaporators. \n\nIt is of note that, there are few scientific papers related to the vacuum evaporation \n\nprocess despite its wide use in the dairy industry. The few available papers focused mainly \n\non calculation of the heat transfer coefficient of different solutions (Ali Adib and Vasseur, \n\n2008; Chun and Seban, 1971; Monnier et al., 2012; Prost et al., 2006), on evaporation \n\nprocess was carried out with industrial equipment, and therefore the initial composition of \n\nthe product and the operating parameters were not fully controlled (due to large-scale \n\nproduction) (Bouman et al., 1993; Jebson and Iyer, 1991; Jebson and Chen, 1997). Others \n\nused laboratory-scale falling film evaporators, where the hydrodynamic profile of the fluids \n\nis not the same as that found on an industrial scale (Adib et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2011; \n\nMonnier et al., 2012; Park et al., 2004; Pehlivan and Ozdemir, 2012). \n\nAn equipment representative of the same process as the industrial scale was \n\ntherefore needed to study the vacuum evaporation process and to improve understanding \n\nof the effects of the operating parameters on the process performance and product quality. \n\nThese issues are the basis for this PhD framework. \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.  Aims, objectives and strategy \n\nThe main aim of the PhD project was to provide some answers regarding the \n\nperformance of evaporators during the concentration of dairy products, by means of \n\nthermodynamic and hydrodynamic approaches relating the interactions between products \n\nproperties and operating parameters. \n\nA prototype of a pilot-scale, single-stage falling film evaporator was therefore used \n\nto tackle these issues. This equipment was designed according to specifications established \n\nby INRA STLO (Science and Technology of Milk and Eggs) Research laboratory, to describe \n\nthe same process as the industrial scale from a hydrodynamic point of view. As it is possible \n\nto perform evaporation at a constant temperature with this pilot evaporator (whereas in \n\nindustrial scale evaporators temperature evolves over time), the time / temperature / \n\nconcentration triplet was simplified to a binomial time / concentration approach. \n\nThe first stage of this PhD project was therefore to characterize the pilot vacuum \n\nevaporator, with instrumentation of the pilot (choice and positioning of the different sensors) \n\nand setting of the thermodynamic balances. This information allowed the determination of \n\nthe operating process range for maximum effectiveness of evaporation of pure water, skim \n\nand whole milk (Chapter 5). \n\nAfter the thermodynamic characterization of the evaporator, hydrodynamic \n\ncharacterization was undertaken (second stage of this PhD project). The hydrodynamic \n\nprofile of water and skim milk were determined using Reynolds number and residence time \n\ndistribution (RTD) functions. In addition to provide important information relating to the \n\nproduct flow profile in the evaporator, RTD functions also provided the time that the product \n\nspent in the evaporator. As the product temperature in this equipment may be kept constant, \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nthe profile                       time / temperature can be accessed. These RTD functions were \n\nmodeled and a physical interpretation of the model was obtained (Chapter 6). \n\nThe thermodynamic and hydrodynamic characterization of the evaporation process \n\nwas performed with other dairy products such as sweet and acid lactic whey. These \n\napproaches indicated the fouling formation during concentration in a falling film evaporator \n\n(Chapter 7). \n\n3.3.  Originality of the research project \n\nThe PhD project has had to combine fundamental and experimental information on \n\nthe \u201cconcentration phenomenon\u201d and aspects related to the flow profile during concentration \n\nof different dairy products in a falling film evaporator. The project consisted of an \n\nexperimental study, where the results of which could be used to improve process \n\nperformance, control and quality in the dairy industry. A prototype pilot vacuum evaporator \n\nwas characterized and instrumented, which are essential steps for further studies of the \n\ninteractions between product and process, and process performance as regards the \n\nprocessing time and cleaning efficiency. \n\nMethodology was developed for the measurement of residence time distribution \n\nfunctions of real products in a falling film evaporator. To date this approach has been used \n\nin cases where the product composition remained constant before and after the process \n\n(e.g. pasteurizers) or with model solutions, which do not represent the complexity of a real \n\nsolution, such as skim milk. The difficulty for calculation the RTD in the vacuum evaporator \n\nequipment is the changes occurring in the product throughout the process, due to increase \n\nin the concentration. The product properties and their interactions with the evaporator \n\nequipment therefore change over the process time. An approach was also proposed for \n\nmodeling these RTD functions. Due to thorough understanding of the process, a physical \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\ninterpretation of the RTD is proposed, which provides important information related to the \n\nflow of different dairy products, such as skim milk, sweet whet and lactic acid whey during \n\nits concentration in a falling film evaporator. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nPART 2 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS, \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nThe aim of this chapter is to describe the working of the pilot scale, single stage \n\nfalling film evaporator, used for carrying out this PhD thesis, and the methodologies used to \n\ncharacterize this process.

Pilot vacuum evaporator \n\nA pilot scale, single stage falling-film evaporator (GEA Process Engineering, St \n\nQuentin-en-Yvelines, France; Fig. 4.1) was used for the characterization of the vacuum \n\nevaporation process. From the hydrodynamic point of view, the working of this equipment is \n\nclose to that used in the dairy industry, i.e. the product falls in a trickling film along the inner \n\nwall of the evaporator tube, with indirect counter-flow contact with primary steam. The \n\nequipment consists of three evaporation tubes connected in series (Fig. 4.1), whose the \n\ndimensions are shown in Table 4.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.

As the vapor emitted by the \n\nproduct (secondary vapor) is not used for heating the product in the next tube, this pilot is a \n\nsingle stage evaporator. A level sensor (Fig. 4.2) is used to inject water at maximum \n\ntemperature of 20\u00b0C into the heating systems when the level of water is below the sensor. \n\nThe aim of this sensor is to ensure that the electric resistances are always immersed in \n\nwater. The production of steam in this equipment is therefore discontinuous, because from \n\nthe moment that water is inserted the temperature of the steam side decrease and therefore \n\nsteam production ceases. The steam production is reestablished when water is heated to \n\nsteam vaporization temperature. Water can be inserted manually or automatically through a \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nwater injection electro valve (Burkert, Triembach au Val, France). When automatically \n\ninjection was set the time of water injection is around 30 min of the process time, against \n\naround 60 min of process time for manually injection. \n\nConcentration of the solutions was performed at a total heating power of 25.20 \u00b1 \n\n0.05 kW (8.40 \u00b1 0.02 kW for each tube), corresponding to the maximum heating power of \n\nthe equipment. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2. Evaporation tube with independent electrical heating system. \n\nThe secondary vapor of the three evaporation tubes are separated in a separator \n\nwith an integrated indirect condenser (coil-type heat exchanger) (Fig. 4.3). As the secondary \n\nvapor (product vapor) is condensed in the condenser, the pressure in the system is reduced \n\nSteam side \n\nProduct side \n\nInlet steam \n\nElectrical resistance \n\nCondensate Steam \n\nNon-condensable gas and \nExcess of steam \n\n(diameter of the section 4mm) \n\nWater Sensor level \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n(Ptotal &lt;0.1 MPa), which leads to a decrease of the evaporation temperature. The \n\nexperiments were performed at an absolute pressure (Pabs) of 0.02 MPa and thus the \n\nevaporation temperature (?ev) was maintained at 60\u00b0C throughout the three tubes. This \n\ntemperature was the most commonly used for concentration of milk in the first stage of \n\nindustrial vacuum evaporators. The temperature is controlled by the mass flow rate of the \n\ncooling water (ranging between 300 kg\u00b7h-1 to 800 kg\u00b7h-1) at a maximum temperature of 20\u00b0C. \n\nA vacuum pump (Fig. 4.3) (liquid ring type, 1.1 kW power consumption) connected to the \n\ncondenser is required for the starting phase and to extract the non-condensable gases, \n\nwhich would otherwise accumulate in the condenser. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3.

The flow rate of the inlet product, concentrate and \n\ncooling water were measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter (Krohne, Romans Sur Isere, \n\nFrance). The pressure was measured with a pressure sensor (Endress Hauser, Huningue, \n\nFrance) in the condenser, which has the same pressure inside the evaporator tubes. \n\nThe product enters at the top of the evaporator tubes and it is dispersed by a plate \n\ndistributor (Fig. 4.5). The aim of this piece is to ensure that a complete film, with thickness \n\naround 1.0 mm to 1.5 mm, is maintained inside the tubes throughout the process time. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInlet product (5 mm) \n\n Plate distributor \n\n \n\n10 mm \n\n55 mm \n\n90 mm \n\n130 mm \n\n34 mm \n\nDTube \n\n90 mm \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5.

Two flowmeters (electromagnetic type \n\n- Krohne, Romans Sur Isere, France) and three conductivity probes (Endress Hauser, \n\nHuningue, France) were added. A cone-shaped concave distributor system (Fig. 4.6) was \n\nalso built (to ensure that a complete film was maintained inside the tubes at all times), and \n\na heat exchanger was added in the product inlet line.

Calibration of the vacuum evaporator sensors \n\nTemperatures, conductivity probes and flowmeters were calibrated when these \n\nsensors were installed. The temperature probes were calibrated at two temperatures, 0\u00b0C \n\nand 80\u00b0C. The difference between the reference and the acquisition temperatures was \n\nalways less than 0.5\u00b0C. For calibration of the flowmeters, the volume flow rate of water \n\nmeasured by the control panel system was compared with the mass flow rate measured \n\nwith a graduated test tube and a chronometer. As the conductivity of the solutions studied \n\nwas in the order of 0.01 mS\u00b7cm-1 to 100 mS\u00b7cm-1, the conductivity probes were calibrated \n\nwith a standard solution (Hanna Instruments, Inc., Tanneries, France) with conductivity \n\nbetween 0.05 and 200 mS\u00b7cm-1. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the measured and \n\nthe calculated flow rate and conductivity was greater than 0.99. \n\n4.3.   Experimental runs \n\nExperimental runs were carried out with water, skim milk, sweet whey and lactic acid \n\nwhey. \n\nSkim milk was reconstituted from low heat skim milk powder (Lactalis ingredients, \n\nBourgbarr\u00e9, France). Fresh concentrated sweet whey and lactic acid whey were obtained \n\nfrom an industrial cheese manufacturer in Brittany (France). Before entering the evaporator \n\nthe products were preheated to the evaporation temperature in a jacketed tank, at the initial \n\nevaporator configuration, and in a tubular indirect preheater (Fig. 4.7) after the additional \n\ninstrumentation. When desired, after passing of the entire product through the three \n\nevaporation tubes (Fig. 4.1) (first run \u2013 1R), the entire volume of the product obtained at the \n\nend of the first run (still at the evaporation temperature) was reintroduced into the equipment \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\nand re-concentrated a second time, again passing through the three evaporation tubes \n\n(second run \u2013 2R). This operation could be performed once more (third run \u2013 3R). \n\nThe vacuum evaporator was divided in four different sections (Fig. 4.8). ? \ncorresponds to the section from the feed to the bottom of the first tube; ? the section from \nthe bottom of the first tube to the bottom of the second tube; ? the section from the bottom \nof the second tube to the bottom of the third tube; and ? the section from the feed to the \nevaporator outlet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nT1 \n\nFeed \n\nT2 T3 \n\n? ? ? \n\n? \n\nOutlet \n11.08 m 12.24 m 12.96 m \n\n36.28 m \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8.

Physicochemical analyses \n\n4.4.1.  Total solids \n\nThe feed and final total solids content (TS) were calculated according to weight loss \n\nafter drying 5 g of each sample with sand in a forced air oven at 105 \u00b0C for 7 h. \n\nDue the low pressure of the process, it was not possible take a sample of the product \n\nat the bottom of the first and second tube without affecting the process parameters \n\n(decrease in the pressure process, product flow rate, temperature, etc.). Therefore the TS \n\nwere calculated at these two points (mass balance) as: \n\nTS???? = ??i?i \u00b7??i?i?????i  Eq. 4.1 \nwhere m???i  is the inlet mass flow rate of the product in tube i, TS??i corresponding to \n\nthe total solids of the inlet product at the bottom of tube i, and m????i corresponding to the \noutlet mass flow rate of the product in tube i.  \n\n4.4.2.  Viscosity measurement \n\nViscosity measurements were obtained at the evaporation temperature with a \n\nPhysica MCR 301 rheometer (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) using a coaxial aluminum cylinder \n\n(inner radius 23.05 mm; outer radius 25 mm; height of rotor 30 mm; gap 5 mm). Shear rates \n\nbetween 10\u00b7s-1 and 1000\u00b7s-1 at the evaporation temperature were used for rheological \n\ndeterminations. As the solutions studied behave as a non-Newtonian fluid at high \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nconcentrations, apparent viscosity at a shear rate of 100\u00b7s-1 (?100) was used to make \n\ncomparisons between the different products. This shear rate value was chosen because it \n\nis representative of the value reached in agitation, flow in tubes and other industrial \n\noperations (Steffe, 1996). As it was not possible to take samples at the bottom of T1 and T2, \n\ncalibration curves of apparent viscosity were obtained (?100) as a function of product total \n\nsolids (Fig. 4.9). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9.

Conductivity \n\nThe conductivity of the product was measured and recorded every second at the \n\nbottom of the three tubes (Fig. 4.7 (SP)) by conductivity-meter (Endress Hauser SAS, \n\nHuningue, France).  \n\n4.4.5.  Protein composition \n\nNon-casein nitrogen (NCN) and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) fractions were \n\ndetermined by the Kjeldhal method (IDF, 1993). Nitrogen content was converted into \n\nequivalent protein content using 6.38 as converting factor for NCN and NPN content, \n\nrespectively. Whey protein content (WPC) was calculated as WPC = NCN\u00b76.38 ? NPN\u00b76.38. \n\n4.4.6.  Ash content \n\nAsh content was determined by incinerating 5 g of the product in a muffle furnace at \n\n550\u00b0C for 5 hours (IDF, 1964). \n\n4.4.7.  Calcium concentration \n\nCalcium concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrometer (Varian \n\n220FS SpectrAA, Les Ulis, France) (Le Gra\u00ebt and Brul\u00e9, 1993). \n\n4.5.  Mass and enthalpy balance \n\nFig. 4.10 provides a diagram representing the mass flow rate and the physical \n\ncharacteristics of the fluids in the evaporator. Each fluid is characterized by its mass flow \n\nrate (m? in kg\u00b7h-1), temperature (? in \u00b0C), pressure (P in MPa) and enthalpy (H in kJ\u00b7kg-1). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10.

Eq. 4.2 \nIn this pilot equipment steam is produced in excess. A part of steam is therefore not \n\nused for energy exchanges. This excess of steam goes to the condenser where it is \n\ncondensed and exits the equipment by the condensates line. The mass of water inserted in \n\nthe heating systems, therefore used to steam production, may be measured. After working \n\nduring a given process time without adding water in the heating systems, the mass of \n\nremaining water was calculated.

This \n\npart of steam is not used to the energy exchange, and it is therefore not taken into account \n\nin the mass and energy balances. Thus the mass of the excess steam is not reported in this \n\nthesis. The non-condensable gases from the steam (Fig. 4.1) were transferred to the \n\ncondenser where they were removed from the system. The mass flow rate of non-\n\ncondensable gas was considered to be negligible, and therefore it was not taken into \n\naccount in the calculation of mass and energy balances. \n\nAt the outlet of the evaporator, the inlet mass flow rate of the product was a \n\ncombination of the mass flow rate of product concentrate and the mass flow rate of \n\nsecondary vapor that was finally converted in product condensate (Fig. 4.10). \n\nm??i? =  m?P??? +  m???  [4.3] \nAs the condenser was an indirect heat-exchanger, there was no mixing of the \n\ncondensate and cooling water. Therefore: \n\nm???i?  = m??????  [4.4] \nAs the steam entering the evaporator tubes was saturated, it is supposed that its \n\ncondensation was complete and that all the steam was transformed into the condensate at \n\nsaturation temperature. Therefore: \n\nm???? =  m???  [4.5] \nThus, only the latent heat of vaporization was exchanged: \n\n?H? =  ?H??? ?  H??? [4.6] \n\n\n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\nwhere  H???  and H??  are the enthalpy of evaporation (kJ\u00b7kg-1) of steam and its \ncondensate, respectively. \n\nThe heating power Q (kW) applied to the three tubes was used to the production of \n\nsaturated steam according to: \n\nQ? =  m????  ?  ?H? [4.7] \nEquation [4.7] thus makes it possible to calculate the mass flow rate of the steam, \n\nwhose pressure and temperature are known, as well as the heating power generated by the \n\nboilers. Expressing heat loss as q??, the enthalpy balance can be written: \n?m????  ?  H????  +  ?m??i?  ?  H?i? ? + ?m???i? ? H??i? ? =  ?m?P???  ?   HP??? ? +  ?m???  ? H?? ? +  ?m???  ?  H???  + ?m?????? ? H????? ? +  q?? [4.8] \n\nWhere q??  comprises the rate of energy losses and error of measurements and \ncalculation. \n\nBy substituting Equations [4.4], [4.5] and [4.6] in Equation [4.8]: \n\nm????  ? ??H?? = ?m?P???  ?

[4.9] \n\nThe left term of equation 4.9 corresponds to the heating power Q provided by the \n\nsteam, i.e. the energy provided by the heating system of the evaporator. \n\n4.6.  Overall heat transfer coefficient \n\nThe overall heat transfer coefficient for each tube was calculated as: \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\nQ = ? \u00b7 A \u00b7 ??            ? = Q A? = ? ? ??         ? = ? ???  Eq. 4.10 \nwhere U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, kW\u00b7m-2?\u00b0C-1; Q the heating power \n\ntransferred to the product, kW; A the heating surface, m2; ?? the mean temperature \n\ndifference between steam and product concentrate, \u00b0C; and ? the heat flux, kW\u00b7m-2. \n\nThe inlet steam temperature and the product temperature (Fig. 4.7 (TS0, TP)) were \n\nused to the measurement of the ??. \n\n4.7.  Assessment of process efficiency \n\nThe energy consumption for evaporation is a key parameter used to assess the \n\nefficiency of a plant. As in drying, it can be evaluated from the Specific Energy Consumption \n\n(SEC; kJ?kg-1 of water evaporated) (Bimbenet et al., 2007), and from the energy efficiency \n\n(EE; % - w\u00b7w-1), that is the ratio between the amount of water evaporated and the amount \n\nof steam, expressed as a percentage. EE can also be represented as the ratio between the \n\nlatent heat vaporization of the steam and of the product. Due to the gradient of temperature \n\nbetween the steam and the product the ratio will not be equal to 1. In an adiabatic process \n\nwithout energy losses EE value is of the order of 99%. SEC and EE are defined by the \n\nfollowing equations: \n\nSEC =   ????? ? ?H?????  Eq. 4.11 \nand \n\nEE = ?????????  Eq. 4.12 \n4.8.  Characterization of the flow \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n\n \n\nFlow was characterized using an experimental Reynolds number of the film (\u00a7 2.4), \n\nand the classification defined by Bird et al. (1960) that established the flow profiles for the \n\nfalling film in three regions was used: \n\n? Ref &lt;25: laminar flow; \n? 25 &lt;Ref &lt;1000: laminar flow with waves (wavy-laminar); \n? Ref > 1000: turbulent flow. \n\nAs Ref was always measured at the bottom of the evaporation tubes, the \n\ncharacterization of the flow behavior in sections ? and ? was always the same, as both \nwere measured at the bottom of T3. \n\nThe maximum flow velocity, corresponding to the velocity of the first fluid elements \n\nthat arrived at the bottom of the evaporation tube, was calculated according to equation 4.13. \n\n???? = ?????? ?? ? ????????i?i?  Eq. 4.13 \nwhere ???? is the maximum flow velocity and t???? the time that the first particles of \n\ntracer take to cross a section of the evaporator equipment (Fig. 4.8). \n\n4.9.  Residence time distribution functions \n\n4.9.1.  Measurement of residence time distribution \n\nRTD were determined experimentally by injecting an inert chemical, molecule or \n\natom, called a tracer, into a reactor at some time, t = 0, and then measuring the tracer \n\nconcentration in the effluent stream as a function of time. In this study, RTD characterization \n\nwas based on the follow-up of the concentration of sodium chloride added to the product. \n\nThe product with 10 g\u00b7kg-1 of sodium chloride was injected into the evaporator for 30 seconds \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\n(Fig. 4.11). The NaCl remains soluble at the concentration used in this study (maximum \n\nconcentration of 20 g\u00b7kg-1) and its concentration did not affect the product viscosity \n\n(Huppertz and Fox, 2006), which is the main parameter related to the product flow behavior \n\n(Ali Adib and Vasseur, 2008; Monnier et al., 2012; Park et al., 2004). The time that the \n\nsodium chloride molecules and the product fluid elements took in the evaporator equipment \n\nwas therefore considered to be the same. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11. Tracer injection x(t) and output signal at bottom of T1 (y1(t)), T2 (y2(t)) \n\nand T3 (y3(t)). \n\nAs the pilot operates as a continuous process, the products with and without the \n\ntracer were put in two different tanks connected to the feed line with a three-way valve, which \n\nallowed rapid change in the nature of the feed product. Using this technique the shape of \n\nthe injection signal could be considered to be a square. \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0 100 200 300 400\n\nN\naC\n\nl \n(g\n\n\u00b7k\ng-\n\n1 )\n\nTime (s)\n\nx(t) y1(t) \n\ny2(t) \n\ny3(t) \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n\n \n\nThe outlet sodium chloride concentration, measured indirectly by conductivity, was \n\ncalculated at the bottom of the three evaporation tubes.

Sodium chloride concentration as a function of conductivity: A: Skim \n\nmilk at 200 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids, B: Sweet whey at 363 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids and C: lactic acid \n\nwhey at 364 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids. \n\nThe RTD signal (Ei(t)) was determined in the four different sections of the vacuum \n\nevaporator (Fig. 3.8) by numerical deconvolution of the outlet signal (i.e. outlet concentration \n\nof NaCl) by the injection signal (i.e. inlet concentration of NaCl). Due to the complexity of the \n\ncalculations performed, the MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release software (2014b, The \n\nMathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States) was used. \n\nE?(t) was calculated by numerical deconvolution of y1(t) with the injection signal \n(x(t)). The sodium chloride concentration measured at the bottom of T1 (y1(t)) was the \n\ninjection signal for calculating E?(t). E?(t) was therefore calculated by numerical \ndeconvolution of y2(t) with y1(t). For E?(t) the injection signal was y2(t), and thus E?(t) was \ncalculated by numerical deconvolution of y2(t) with y3(t). (Eq. 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16). The \n\noverall RTD from the inlet to the outlet of the evaporator (E?(t)) was calculated by numerical \ndeconvolution of yT3(t) by the injection signal (x(t)) (Eq 4.17). \n\nyT1(t) = x?t? ? E?(t) Eq. 4.14 \nyT2(t) = yT1(t) ? E?(t) Eq. 4.15 \nyT3(t) = yT2(t) ? E?(t) Eq. 4.16 \nyT3(t) = x(t) ? E?(t) Eq. 4.17 \n\nHaving determined Ei(t) for the different sections of the vacuum evaporator, it was \n\nthen possible to determine both the residence time of each fluid element and the time at \n\nwhich a certain fraction of the material entering at t = 0 was no longer present in the \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nequipment. The mean residence time, ?, corresponded to the time when 50% of the material \n\nentering at t = 0 passed through the equipment. In other words this parameter corresponded \n\nto the time for recorded 50% of the inlet sodium chloride molecules at the outlet of the \n\nequipment. \n\n4.9.2.  Model of the residence time distribution functions \n\nDifferent models were tested to model the RTD functions for the four different \n\nsections of the falling film evaporator. Due to the changes in product composition during the \n\nvacuum evaporation (i.e. increase in product viscosity and changes in the flow profile), the \n\ndispersion of the particles in the equipment was more pronounced than in plug flow systems. \n\nTherefore the RTD functions were modeled by a set of perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series \n\nin order to take into account the flow profile in the evaporator. Each reactor set includes Ni \n\nreactor tanks in series, and can be characterized by a mean residence time (ki). Its own RTD \n\nfunction is defined by: \n\nE??t? = ?Ni?i ?Ni \u00b7 ?iNi??\u00b7 ??? ?Ni\u00b7 ?i ?i? ??Ni???!  Eq. 4.18 \nThe number of tanks in series, Ni, provides information about the dispersion of the \n\nfluid elements: a high N value indicates low dispersion of the particles in the reactor \n\n(Gutierrez et al., 2010). \n\nDifferent arrangements of perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series were studied. For \n\nthis study the model of two reactor sets in parallel (Fig. 3.13) was the most effective to model \n\nthe experimental RTD functions. The product therefore was considered to pass through two \n\nreactor sets, A and B, characterized by two RTD functions Ea(t) and Eb(t). Reactor set C was \n\na combination of these two reactor sets (Fig. 4.13). It was characterized by the function Ec(t), \n\nwhich describes the experimental RTD of the falling film evaporator (Eq. 4.19). \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n\n \n\nE??t? = ?? ? a? ? E??t? + a ? E???? Eq. 4.19 \nwhere a refers to the fraction of feed flow rate going into reactor set A. The three \n\nparameters of each reactor set (ai, ?i and Ni) were adjusted step by step in order to fit the \n\nmodeled curve to the experimental curve. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13.

Using the acquisition instrumentation of the pilot and an inlet mass flow rate of 50 kg\u00b7h-\n\n1, initially no significant variation (p &lt;0.05) in the evaporation rate or in the energy efficiency \n\nfor two runs with skim milk were found, but the values were higher than those obtained with \n\nthe experiments with water. The heat transfer coefficient did not differ according to the \n\nproduct and this result does not explain why the evaporation of SM was more effective than \n\nthat of water. The results of this Chapter were published in Dairy Science and Technology1. \n\nAfter additional instrumentation of the pilot, some problems were identified with the \n\nwater level sensor of the heating systems and the distributor system of the evaporator tubes. \n\nAfter solving these problems and using the same operating conditions, the difference \n\nbetween the effectiveness of evaporation of water, skim and whole milk was studied. No \n\nsignificant variations were found (p &lt;0.05) in the evaporation rate or in the energy efficiency \n\nfor the experiments with water, skim milk (two runs \u2013 83.0 g\u00b7kg-1 to 471.0 g\u00b7kg-1 of total \n\nsolids), and during the first run of whole milk (114 g\u00b7kg-1 to 265 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids), but the \n\nvalues were lower in the second run of the whole milk experiments (265 g\u00b7kg-1 to 545 g\u00b7kg-\n\n1 of total solids), where a poor wetting rate was identified in the evaporator tubes. The \n\nexperiments were then performed at an inlet mass flow rate of 70 kg\u00b7h-1. No significant \n\nvariations were then found (p &lt;0.05) in the evaporation rate or in the energy efficiency for \n\nall runs and products. \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\nThe appropriate instrumentation of the vacuum evaporation process allowed \n\nidentification and correction of the process problems and was necessary to keep an efficient \n\nworking of evaporators. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 Accepted as: Silveira, A.C.P., Carvalho, A.F., Perrone, \u00cd.T., Fromont, L., M\u00e9jean, S., \n\nTanguy, G., Jeantet, R., Schuck, P., 2013.

Introduction \n\nEvaporation is a process through which a liquid is brought to its boiling point by \n\nexternal heating, transforming the solvent into vapor that escapes from the surface of the \n\nliquid. Such thermal concentration is commonly used for liquid foods (i.e. milk, fruit juice and \n\nsugar solutions) to manufacture products such as sweet condensed milk (G\u00e4nzle et al., \n\n2008), \u201cdulce de leche\u201d (Hentges et al., 2010), beet or cane sugar, fruit juice (Tonelli et al., \n\n1990) and tomato sauce concentrates (Runyon et al., 1991). Above all, it is an intermediate \n\nprocess in the production of milk, buttermilk and whey powders (Schuck, 2002), infant \n\nformula (Zhu et al., 2011), protein isolates (Onwulata et al., 2006), etc. \n\nIn order to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact, it is important that \n\nevaporators operate at their maximum capacity, which is strongly dependent on the overall \n\nheat transfer coefficient. This parameter cannot be considered as an intrinsic characteristic \n\nof the evaporator, since it also depends on the nature of the product and on their flow \n\nconditions (Mafart, 1991). The factors that control heat transfer in the evaporator tubes are \n\nimportant for close monitoring of the evaporation process and for calculating the dimensions \n\nof evaporators (Bouman et al., 1993; Jebson and Iyer, 1991). \n\nAs boiling and concentration take place inside the falling-film evaporator, the study \n\nof the mechanisms is complex, because both occur simultaneously (Li et al., 2011; Pehlivan \n\nand Ozdemir, 2012). Some studies of the evaporation process reported in the literature were \n\ncarried out on industrial evaporators. In this case, operating conditions such as the \n\nconfiguration of the equipment and the quality of the raw materials were not controlled \n\n(Jebson and Iyer, 1991; Jebson and Chen, 1997). In contrast, other studies on laboratory \n\nand pilot scales were carried out using model solutions (water, sucrose solutions, etc.) (Luo \n\net al., 2011; Prost et al., 2006) and evaporation systems whose design had been modified \n\nfrom industrial evaporators in order to separate phenomena and facilitate their \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\nunderstanding (Adib et al., 2009; Bouman et al., 1993). There is, therefore, only limited \n\ninformation on evaporator performance, i.e. the performance of real evaporators working \n\nwith real products over real concentration steps. \n\nThe aim of this study was to compare heat and mass balance using a pilot scale, \n\nsingle stage vacuum falling film evaporator composed of three tubes in series, for the \n\nevaporation of skim milk and water. This equipment was designed to study both phenomena \n\n(boiling and concentration) occurring during the evaporation of dairy products. The \n\nexperimental effectiveness of evaporation were compared to theoretical effectiveness with \n\nno energy loss. The investigation also involved calculation of the energy used by the \n\nevaporator, the overall heat transfer coefficient for each run, and study of the factors \n\ninfluencing the evaporation rate of skim milk compared to water. \n\n5.2.  Materials and methods \n\n5.2.1.  Pilot vacuum evaporator and experiments \n\nThe experiments were performed with the pilot scale, single stage falling-film \n\nevaporator equipped with the acquisition sensors (described in Chapter 4.1). \n\nAll experiments were performed at the product inlet temperature of 60 \u00b0C, an \n\nabsolute pressure (Pabs) of 0.02 MPa, and thus the evaporation temperature (?ev) was \n\nmaintained at 60 \u00b0C throughout the three tubes. These experiments were taken in triplicate \n\nat ambient temperature. \n\n5.2.2.  Experimental runs \n\nExperimental runs were carried out with water (maximum hardness of 80 mg \n\nCaCO3\u00b7kg-1) and skim milk at two different initial concentrations. All experiments were \n\nperformed at an inlet mass flow rate of 50.0 \u00b1 0.7 kg\u00b7h-1 and the results analyzed after 30 \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\nmin of process time. This short process time was chosen to evite fouling formation. The \n\nvalue of inlet flow rate was provided by the evaporator manufacturer as a good flow rate for \n\nmilk concentration. It was therefore used to characterize thermodynamically the evaporation \n\nprocess. \n\nSkim milk was prepared at 100.0 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids (TS) from dairy powder (Societ\u00e9 \n\nMayenne, Mayenne, France). It was heated to 60 \u00b0C before evaporation. The total process \n\ntime was around 60 min to avoid fouling formation from 200 kg of product. After the first run \n\n(1R) through the evaporator, skim milk was concentrated from 100.0 g\u00b7kg-1 TS to 240.0 g\u00b7kg-\n\n1 TS. This product, still at 60 \u00b0C, was reintroduced into the evaporator where it was re-\n\nconcentrated (second run (2R)) from 240.0 g\u00b7kg-1 TS to 520.0 g\u00b7kg-1 TS (Table 5.1). \n\nTable 5.1.

Statistical analysis \n\nData were analyzed by regression analysis of variance using SAS (2008) software, \n\nat the 0.05 level of significance. \n\n5.3.  Results and discussion \n\n5.3.1.  Mass balance \n\nThe initial and final product concentrations before and after the run in the evaporator \n\nare presented in Table 5.1. The viscosity of these solutions was also measured (Table 5.1). \n\nThe viscosity of water remained constant during evaporation, whereas the viscosity of skim \n\nmilk increased from 1.0? mPa?s to 2.?3 mPa?s during the 1R, and its behavior was \n\nNewtonian, i.e. its viscosity remained constant whatever the shear rate. In the 2R run the \n\nviscosity increased from 2.?3 mPa?s at 240.0 g\u00b7kg-1 of TS to 23.?1 mPa?s at ?20.0 g\u00b7kg-1 of \n\nTS. At this concentration, the product had a shear thinning behavior, i.e. its viscosity \n\ndecreased with increasing shear rate. This behavior can be explained as a consequence of \n\nincreasing the shear rate which induces the asymmetric dispersed molecules to align \n\nthemselves within the shear planes, causing the frictional resistance to diminish (Tung, 1978; \n\nVelez Ruiz and Barbosa Canovas, 1997). The mass balance of the process was effective \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\n \n\nfor all experiments, with a maximum error of 4.6 %, representing the difference between the \n\ninlet and outlet mass flow rates (Eq. 4.2). The evaporation rate was calculated by subtracting \n\nthe inlet flow rate of the product and the outlet flow rate of the product concentrate. This \n\nparameter reflects the amount of water evaporated from the product. There was no \n\nsignificant variation (p &lt;0.05) in the evaporation rate for the two runs carried out with skim \n\nmilk, and it was higher than that obtained for the experiments carried out with water. To \n\nexplain these results, the enthalpy balance was calculated and the process efficiency \n\nassessed (Table 5.2). \n\n5.3.2.  Enthalpy balance \n\nTo calculate the energy balance, the vacuum evaporation process was considered \n\nas a single system (Fig. 4.10). In other words, we took into account the average temperature \n\nof the steam measured in the three tubes (Fig. 4.4 (TSin)) and the sum of the mass of steam \n\ncondensed on the three tubes. The temperature of the outlet steam (Fig. 4.4 (TSout)), \n\nremained constant at 75 \u00b0C for all experiments. In this case, it was assumed that all energy \n\nexchanged between the steam and the product corresponded to latent heat, and \n\nconsequently the steam temperature was the same as for the steam condensate (75 \u00b0C).The \n\npilot scale evaporator could thus be considered as a full latent heat exchanger. \n\nThe enthalpy balance data for the experiments performed with skim milk and water \n\nare given in Table 5.2. There was no significant variation (p &lt;0.05) in the enthalpy balance \n\nerror for the experiments. The difference between the inlet and outlet enthalpy values \n\nrepresented the heat losses q?? (Eq. 4.3) by radiation and convection to the surrounding air. \nSuch loss is variable and difficult to measure, depending on factors such as the nature of \n\nthe steel (state of polish), the temperature difference between the surfaces of the evaporator \n\nand ambient air, etc. In industrial single stage evaporators, an allowance is made for heat \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n\n \n\nlosses up to 1% (Jebson and Iyer, 1991) but with this pilot scale evaporator, these energy \n\nlosses were expected to be greater as the scale was reduced. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.

For \n\nthe experiments with skim milk, there was no significant variation (p &lt;0.05) in the SEC and \n\nInlet mass flow rate = 50 kg\u00b7h-1 \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n\n \n\nthis value was lower than the values obtained with water (Table 5.2), in agreement with the \n\nevaporation rate (Table 5.1). Energy efficiency was calculated to provide a better evaluation \n\nof the process yield (Eq. 4.12). This parameter can be interpreted as the percentage of \n\nenergy gained from the steam which is used for evaporating 1 kg of product. As expected \n\nfrom the SEC results, there was no significant variation (p &lt;0.05) in the energy efficiency \n\n(EE) for the experiments with skim milk, and it was higher than the values obtained for the \n\nexperiments with water. The average values of the EE were close to 80 % for experiments \n\nwith skim milk and 70 % for experiments with water (Table 5.2), the difference from 100% \n\n(in a theoretical one stage vacuum evaporator) corresponding to the environmental heat lost, \n\nproduct elevation boiling point, wall thermal resistance, etc.. Experiments conducted with \n\nwater at other heat fluxes showed similar energy efficiency values, demonstrating that the \n\nenergy from the steam is always produced in excess in this pilot evaporator, thus leading to \n\na lower energy yield. \n\n5.3.3.  Overall heat transfer coefficient \n\nTo complement and confirm the results obtained, the overall heat transfer coefficient \n\nfor each tube and for all three products was calculated. The results are shown in Table 5.3. \n\nTable 5.3. Calculated values of heat transfer coefficient and operating parameters \n\nfor each tube of the vacuum evaporator.

The \n\ndiameter of the first tube was greater than the other two (36 mm versus 23 mm). The heat \n\nflux in the first tube, calculated according to Eq. 4.10, was therefore lower than in the other \n\ntubes. The temperature difference between the steam and the product was the same for all \n\nthe products (p &lt;0.05). This temperature gap was greater than that applied industrially, \n\nwhich is generally less than 10 \u00b0C (Adib et al., 2009). \n\nThe overall heat transfer coefficient (U), calculated according to Eq. 4.10, was the \n\nsame (p &lt;0.05) in the first tube for all products (Table 5.3), i.e. an average value of 1.24 \n\nkW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1, whereas it was close to 1.96 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 in the other two tubes. Jebson and \n\nChen (1997) obtained values of U between 0.8 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 and 3.08 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 for whole \n\nmilk measured from several milk powder factories; Jebson and Iyer (1991) found values of \n\nU between 2.00 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 and 3.50 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 for skim milk concentrated in five-effect \n\nevaporators; Prost et al. (2006) reported values of U between 2.08 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 and 2.40 \n\nkW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 for water evaporated in the first effect of a third-effect evaporator. \n\nIn these experiments, the heat transfer coefficient was the same for the same \n\noperating conditions (?, ??, Pabs) whatever the product. This result does not explain why the \n\nevaporation rate of skim milk was greater than that of water (Table 5.1). It is emphasized \n\nInlet mass flow rate = 50 kg\u00b7h-1 \nHeating power= 25.2 kW \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n\n \n\nthat the inverse of U is overall resistance resulting from the addition of four resistance levels \n\nin a series, where the limiting resistance is generally the value on the product side between \n\nthe wall and the evaporated liquid, especially at high concentrations (Jebson and Iyer, 1991; \n\nJebson and Chen, 1997). This value depends on several factors: \n\n? Physical properties of the product treated (viscosity, ?p, density, ?p, surface \ntension, jp, etc.), \n\n? Process conditions (heat flux, ?, temperature difference, ??, boiling \ntemperature, ?p...) \n\n? Nature and geometry of the heating surface, (roughness R, etc.). \n\nThese three types of parameter influence the values of the heat transfer coefficient \n\nof the product side and therefore the values of U. \n\nThus the behavior of a product and the efficiency of the evaporation process (SEC, \n\nevaporation rate, etc.) cannot be predicted with only its overall heat transfer coefficient. \n\nIt should be remembered that the evaporation rate is related to the operation \n\nconditions (e.g., distribution system, heat flux, etc.) (Morison et al., 2006) and product \n\ncharacteristics, such as viscosity and surface tension (Morison et al., 2006; Paramalingam \n\net al., 2000; Pehlivan and Ozdemir, 2012). Moreover, product viscosity has an impact on the \n\nthickness and the residence time distribution of the thin falling film. The flow behavior of the \n\nproduct throughout the evaporator is modified according to its viscosity: a thicker and slower \n\nthin film should be formed at the end of the skim milk concentration process compared to \n\nwater. Therefore the higher level of viscosity might result in a longer residence time of the \n\nproduct in the evaporator and thus a longer time when the product would receive the \n\nevaporation energy, thereby increasing the evaporation rate. \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n\n \n\n5.4.  Additional information \n\nAn additional instrumentation of the evaporation pilot was performed to improve \n\ncharacterization and understanding of the evaporation process (\u00a7 4.2.2.). The pilot \n\nequipment could thus be divided into four different sections (Fig. 4.8), where the evaporation \n\nrate of each tube could be assessed (since the inlet and outlet product flow rate of each tube \n\ncould be measured). With the new information some problems were identified in performing \n\nthe experiments, such as a lower wetting rate of the tubes and poor regulation of the water \n\nlevel sensor of the heating system. \n\n5.4.1.  Distributor system \n\nThe plate distributor system (Fig. 4.5), located at the top of the evaporator tubes, did \n\nnot disperse the water homogeneously (Fig. 5.1 (A)), and therefore a film breakdown (Fig. \n\n2.14) occurred. Since product film formation did not take place uniformly throughout the \n\nevaporator tube, the efficiency of the process decreased. The poor wetting rate of the tubes \n\nled to the formation of dry patches in the tubes (Fig. 2.14), and this phenomenon thus \n\ncontributed to loss in the heat transfer surface. The plate distributor system was then \n\nchanged to a cone-shaped concave distributor (Fig. 4.6). The water dispersion was more \n\neffective with the new distributor system (Fig. 5.1 (B)). Dispersion of skim milk with the plate \n\ndistributor was better than water dispersion (Fig. 5.1 (C)), possibly related to differences in \n\nproduct properties, especially surface tension and viscosity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.

Water level sensor of the heating tubes \n\nThe water level sensor of the three heating systems (Fig. 5.2) was poorly regulated. \n\nA delay of a few seconds in closing the water injection electro valve occurred when fills the \n\nheating systems and an excess of water was therefore injected into the heating system. This \n\nA \n\nC \n\nB \n\n\n\n \n\n104 \n\n \n\nexcess flowed to the steam side of the evaporator tubes, thus decreasing the heat transfer \n\nsurface (Fig. 5.2). This problem occurred mainly in the first evaporator tube. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2. Evaporator tube showing the water sensor level and the loss of heat \n\ntransfer surface due the excess water injected into the heating system. \n\nThe experiments with skim milk and water were always performed on the same day, \n\nin order to retain the same ambient conditions (same room temperature) and always with \n\nwater prior to milk. The heating systems were filled with water at the beginning of the \n\nexperiments and, due to the problem with the water level sensor, a loss of heat transfer \n\nsurface occurred (Fig. 5.2). \n\nMaximum heat transfer \nsurface \n\nWater level sensor \n\nLoss of heat transfer \nsurface \n\nExcess of inlet water \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n\n \n\nAs steam is always produced in excess in this pilot equipment, a part of the steam \n\ngoes to the condenser (Fig. 4.1). This mass was calculated experimentally as 1.77 kg\u00b7h-1 of \n\nexcess steam produced by each heating system, i.e. not used to exchange energy. This \n\nsteam mass was not used in the calculation of the energy balance. The steam produced in \n\nexcess was thus condensed in the condenser and extracted by the condensate evacuation \n\npump (Fig. 4.1). A decrease in the water level in the heating system and an increase in the \n\nused heat transfer surface therefore occurred over time. The evaporation rate thus \n\nincreased in relation to the process time, and the heat transfer surface for skim milk \n\nexperiments was greater than for water experiments (since the experiments with milk were \n\nalways carried out after water experiments). \n\nThese two factors, i.e. poor distribution of water in the evaporator tubes and higher \n\nheat transfer surface for skim milk experiments, together explain the lower evaporation rate \n\nof water compared to skim milk. \n\n5.4.3.  Investigation of the effectiveness of evaporation after \n\nimprovement of the pilot vacuum evaporator \n\nAfter regulation of the water level sensor, change in the distributor system and use \n\nof manual injection of water into the heating systems, a new characterization of the \n\nevaporator process was undertaken. Solutions of water, fresh skim milk and whole milk (26 \n\ng\u00b7kg-1 fat content) were studied to validate the difference in the effectiveness of evaporation. \n\nThe effects of the inlet mass flow rate of the product at 50 kg\u00b7h-1 and 70 kg\u00b7h-1 were also \n\nstudied. All other operating parameters of the evaporation process were kept constant. \n\nThe initial and final product concentrations before and after the runs in the evaporator \n\nare presented in Table 5.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.4.

The inlet mass flow rate of 50 kg\u00b7h-1 was thus not sufficient to ensure a minimum \n\nwetting rate for the surface of the tubes when the solution to be concentrated had a high \n\nviscosity/total solids values. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4.

As the heating power was constant \n\nfor the two inlet mass flow rates studied (25.20 \u00b1 0.05 kW), the evaporation rate for all \n\nsolutions and runs at 70 kg\u00b7h-1 was the same (p &lt;0.05) (27.4 \u00b1 0.5 kg\u00b7h-1) as that of skim \n\nmilk in the two runs, whole milk in the first run and water at 50 kg\u00b7h-1. \n\n60\n\n62\n\n64\n\n66\n\n68\n\n70\n\n72\n\n74\n\n76\n\n78\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120In\nle\n\nt \nst\n\ne\na\n\nm\n T\n\ne\nm\n\np\ne\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n (\n\n\u00b0C\n)\n\nProcess time (min)\n\n1st 2nd 3rd\n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n\n \n\nSince there was no difference in the evaporation rate of any of the solutions studied \n\nat the inlet mass flow rate of 70 kg\u00b7h-1, the increase in the inlet mass flow rate (50 kg\u00b7h-1 to \n\n70 kg\u00b7h-1) was effective to ensure a good wetting rate of the evaporator tubes. \n\nThe energy loss, SEC and EE were constant, (8.5 \u00b1 1.2 %, 2795 \u00b1 32 kJ\u00b7kg-1 and 89 \n\n\u00b1 1 %, respectively), for all solutions and runs conducted at 70 kg\u00b7h-1. \n\n5.5.  Conclusion \n\nThe effectiveness of a pilot scale single stage falling-film evaporator for the \n\nevaporation of water and skim milk was studied, for which a wide range of information was \n\nrequired, i.e. information related to the operating conditions as well as information related to \n\nthe product. \n\nIt was first demonstrated that the evaporation rate of skim milk was greater than that \n\nof water in the same operating conditions. Certain conclusions were drawn to explain this \n\nphenomenon, such as influence of product viscosity, product dispersion in the tubes, \n\nresidence time etc. \n\nSome modifications were performed on the pilot evaporator to improve the \n\nunderstanding of its working. These modifications revealed that there was no difference in \n\nevaporation rate between the first and second runs of skim milk, water and first run of whole \n\nmilk. The second run of whole milk showed a lower evaporation rate, where a problem in \n\nthe wetting rate of the tubes was identified. \n\nAt the mass flow rate of 70 kg\u00b7h-1 there was no difference in the evaporation rate, \n\nenergy loss, SEC and EE for any of the solutions studied. This inlet mass flow rate showed \n\nsufficient efficiency to ensure a good wetting rate of the evaporator tubes. \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n\n \n\nImprove understanding of the process combined with suitable instrumentation of the \n\nvacuum evaporator equipment proved to be effective in identifying and solving problems in \n\nthis process. Further studies of the evaporation process are needed to investigate the \n\ninfluence of the product residence time distribution and the flow profile in order to improve \n\nthe working and understanding of evaporators. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n\n \n\nChapter ? \nFLOW REGIME ASSESSMENT IN FALLING FILM \n\nEVAPORATORS USING RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION \n\nFUNCTIONS \n\nThe aim of this chapter is to describe the flow regime, and characterize and model \n\nthe residence time distribution (RTD) functions of a falling film evaporator (FFE). \n\nExperimental runs were carried out with skim milk at 60 kg\u00b7h-1, 70 kg\u00b7h-1 and 80 kg\u00b7h-1 and \n\nwater at 70 kg\u00b7h-1 of feed mass flow rates. Flow was characterized using experimental \n\nReynolds number (Ref). The RTD function in the FFE was measured in four sections of the \n\nvacuum evaporator equipment. These RTD functions were modeled by a combination of \n\nperfectly mixed reactor tanks in series. In this study, the turbulent and wavy-laminar flow \n\nregime had the same mean residence time, otherwise when the flow regime changed from \n\nwavy-laminar to laminar, the mean residence time increased. The flow was analyzed as a \n\nmain and a minor retarded flow, where two layers of product flowed through the evaporator \n\ntubes. The future of this work consists of extending the RTD approach to other products and \n\noperating conditions in the evaporator device.

Introduction \n\nConcentration by vacuum evaporation is used to decrease the volume and weight of \n\nthe product, which subsequently reduces the cost of packaging, storage and transport and \n\nfacilitates the conservation of the concentrate by lowering the water activity ( Bouman et al., \n\n1993; Prost et al., 2006; Bimbenet et al., 2007). This process is used for the production of \n\nfinal (sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, etc.) (G\u00e4nzle et al., 2008), and \n\nintermediate products before any further operations such as crystallization, precipitation, \n\ncoagulation or drying (infant formulae, whey and milk powders, etc.) (Schuck, 2002; \n\nBimbenet et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011). \n\nFalling film evaporators (FFE) are widely used in the chemical and food industries \n\nfor their ability to process heat-sensitive products. The evaporator device is called \"falling \n\nfilm\" because the liquid falls in a trickling film along the inner wall of the tube. This type of \n\ndevice allows higher heat transfer coefficients, therefore lower residence times can be \n\nachieved in comparison with other designs of evaporator (Bimbenet et al., 2007). However, \n\nindustrial control of this process often relies on an empirical understanding of the \n\nphenomena involved, which then results in a time and cost consuming development phase \n\nto establish optimal operating conditions when the final product quality must be changed or \n\na new type of product processed. \n\nAs boiling and concentration occur simultaneously inside the FFE, the study of the \n\nmechanisms is complex (Li et al., 2011; Pehlivan and Ozdemir, 2012); indeed, the rates of \n\nenzymatic and chemical changes depend on solute concentration, product temperature and \n\ntime, and it is therefore necessary take into account these three parameters in order to \n\ncontrol thermal damage of constituents and process-dependent properties (product \n\nphysicochemical properties and product end-properties). \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n\n \n\nMoreover, the few scientific papers available on the topic of vacuum evaporation in \n\nfood and chemical domains mainly focus on the calculation and optimization of the heat \n\ntransfer coefficient (Chun and Seban, 1971; Mafart, 1991; Jebson and Iyer, 1991; Bouman \n\net al., 1993; Chun and Park, 1995; Jebson and Chen, 1997; Silveira et al., 2013), and there \n\nis a lack of research and information concerning the characterization of the flow regime and \n\nof the residence time distribution (RTD) functions of the product, E(t), during concentration \n\nin FFE. Moreover, RTD is a powerful approach to characterizing the mixing phenomena and \n\nflow regime in chemical reactor systems, which allows comparison with ideal reactors. \n\nDetermination of the product RTD is an overall and experimental approach which \n\nprovides valuable information about the product flow regime in the evaporator, according to \n\nthe operational conditions. It does not provide a good physical understanding of the \n\noperation as computational fluid dynamics does but, on the other hand, it integrates the \n\nproduct and process complexity fully. \n\nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) allow study of the consequences of \n\nmodifications in operating conditions (temperature, flow rate) and process configuration with \n\nregard to particle characteristics (temperature, water content) and trajectories in the dryer \n\n(Ducept et al., 2002; Verdurmen et al., 2002). Nevertheless a numerical simulation of a real \n\nevaporator process is not accessible in practice: complex geometry (evaporation tubes, \n\npipelines, pumps, etc.), presence of water and vapor, pressure alterations, etc. The \n\nexperimental CFD is too complex, and hardly representative of the evaporation process. \n\nThe experimental RTD allows, in a relatively simple way, to have valuable information about \n\nthe product and process complexity fully. \n\nSince the pioneering work of Danckwerts (1953), the RTD theory has been widely \n\ndeveloped, and is nowadays used in a more general context in order to determine a \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\npopulation balance model (Villermaux, 1982), where the basis of this model is that the \n\nnumber of entities with certain properties in a system is a balanceable quantity. Such \n\nproperties include, size, mass, and age. RTD theory is also used to optimize the process in \n\nterms of capital and operation costs (Malcata, 1991). The latter represent an essential step \n\nto managing and controlling the quality of food products. Burton et al., (1959) applied the \n\nconcept of RTD to food engineering in order to calculate the sterilizing effectiveness of an \n\nUHT apparatus for milk processing. Baloh (1979), showed that the loss of sugar in \n\npasteurization and evaporation processes of various processing schemes in the sugar \n\nindustry could be significantly lowered by reducing the mean residence time of sweet juice. \n\nThor and Loncin (1978), established the mechanisms of rinsing (e.g. mass flow rate and \n\nshear stress) of a plate heat exchanger by the measurement of RTD, and thereby laid down \n\nthe basis for optimizing rinsing equipment in food engineering. Jeantet et al. (2008), \n\ncalculated and modelled the RTD for different sections of a spray-dryer tower for skim milk, \n\nand described the intensity of the heat treatment that the product was subjected to during \n\nthis process. \n\nNo studies have been published on the characterization and modeling of RTD in \n\nfalling film evaporators for concentration of food products. Understanding both RTD and \n\nkinetics of product temperature along its flow in the equipment should pave the way for \n\nfurther prediction of chemical changes (e.g. protein denaturation) that occur during this \n\nprocessing step. The aim of this study was first to characterize RTD functions of a pilot falling \n\nfilm evaporator experimentally, and then to model these RTD functions and identify the flow \n\nregime of the process. \n\n6.2.  Materials and Methods \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\n \n\n6.2.1.  Pilot vacuum evaporator \n\nThe experiments were performed with the pilot scale, single stage falling film \n\nevaporator with the additional instrumentation (described in Chapter 4.2.2) without the \n\npreheater. The product was heated at the evaporation temperature in a jacketed tank before \n\nentering the equipment. \n\nAll experiments were performed at an absolute pressure (Pabs) of 0.02 MPa, and thus \n\nthe saturation temperature of evaporation was maintained at 60 \u00b0C throughout the three \n\ntubes. \n\n6.2.2.  Experimental runs \n\nExperimental runs were carried out with skim milk at three different feed mass flow \n\nrates (60 kg\u00b7h-1, 70 kg\u00b7h-1and 80 kg\u00b7h-1). \n\nSkim milk was recombined at 100 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids (TS) from skim milk powder \n\n(Lactalis ingredients, Bourgbarr\u00e9, France). It was concentrated in three runs in the \n\nevaporator equipment. The inlet and outlet TS of skim milk concentrates at the bottom of the \n\nthree evaporations tubes for the three feed mass flow rates and runs studied are shown in \n\nTable 6.1. The total process time was around 60 min to avoid fouling formation from 200 kg \n\nof product. \n\nThe conductivity of skim milk concentrates exceeding 520 g\u00b7kg-1 of TS could not be \n\nmeasured reliably due to their high viscosity. Therefore, for the feed mass flow rate of 60 \n\nkg\u00b7h-1, the TS of the product exiting the second run at 389 g\u00b7kg-1 (Table 6.1) were diluted to \n\n283 g\u00b7kg-1 of TS and re-introduced into the evaporator for the third run. This dilution was \n\nundertaken to limit the concentration to 520 g\u00b7kg-1 of TS at the end of the third run. \n\nIn total, 27 experiments were performed, at three feed mass flow rates and in three \n\nruns. The experimental conditions are summarized in Table 6.1. \n\n\n\n \n\n120 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\nTable 6.1.

Product and flow characterization \n\nAlthough the mass flow rate of product was higher in T1 compared to the other two \n\ntubes, the value of ? at the bottom of T1 was always lower than those at the bottom of T2 \n\nand T3 for the same feed flow rate because of a higher inner diameter (0.036 m for T1 \n\ninstead of 0.023 m for T2 and T3 (Table 4.1)). As tubes T2 and T3 had the same diameter, \n\n? at these points depended only on the mass flow rate of the product (Eq. 3.12). Due to \n\nevaporation, the mass flow rate of the product at the bottom of T2 was always higher than \n\nthat at the bottom of T3: ?T2 > ?T3. For the experiments conducted at 80 kg\u00b7h-1, the ? \n\nincreased from 0.170 kg\u00b7s-1\u00b7m-1 to 0.177 kg\u00b7s-1\u00b7m-1 at the bottom of T1 / 1R and T1 / 3R, \n\nrespectively (Table 6.1), evidencing a decrease in the evaporation rate when the \n\nconcentration of the inlet product increased from 108 g\u00b7kg-1 to 254 g\u00b7kg-1 of TS. Compared \n\nto other tubes and runs, the increase in the product concentration caused an increase in the \n\n?, and therefore a decrease in the evaporation rate, as the concentrate mass flow rate \n\nincreased. These results are in agreement with those of (Morison and Broome, 2014). \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\n \n\nThe concentration of the product at the bottom of the three evaporation tubes for the \n\nthree feed mass flow rates and runs studied is shown in Table 6.1. At 80 kg\u00b7h-1 the skim milk \n\nconcentration at the end of the third run of the evaporation process was 350 g\u00b7kg-1 compared \n\nto 434 g\u00b7kg-1 and 516 g\u00b7kg\u00b7g-1 at feed mass flow rates of 70 kg\u00b7h-1 and 60 kg\u00b7h-1, respectively. \n\nAs the evaporation parameters, and in particular the heating power, were kept constant \n\n(except for the feed mass flow rate) the energy transferred to the product was the same, \n\nand therefore the concentration of the product at the bottom of the evaporator tubes \n\nincreased according to the decrease in feed mass flow rate. \n\nDensity increased proportionately with TS of the skim milk concentrates, whereas \n\nviscosity increased exponentially from approximately 365 g\u00b7kg-1 of TS, which is consistent \n\nwith the results of (Chong et al., 2009). The apparent viscosity, ?100, of skim milk concentrate \n\nat 516 g\u00b7kg-1 of TS was 68.3\u00b710-3 Pa\u00b7s. This value, that was higher than that found by \n\n(Silveira et al., 2013), might be explained by the time that the product remained at 60\u00b0C \n\nbefore measurements. Indeed at higher concentration, the viscosity of the milk concentrate \n\nincreased with time, a phenomenon known as age thickening (Westergaard, 2004). Thus \n\nthe residence time of the product during concentration in the FFE may affect the viscosity of \n\nthe concentrate (Baldwin et al., 1980). Viscosity is an important parameter to be monitored \n\nfor optimal atomization in a spray-dryer (Schuck, 2002; Westergaard, 2004). \n\nThe values of Ref are shown in Table 6.1. Ref varied between 971 and 8, points \n\ncorresponding to the maximum and minimum flow rates and product concentration at 80 \n\nkg\u00b7h-1 at bottom of T1 / R1 and at 60 kg\u00b7h-1 at the bottom of T3 / 3R. In this study, Ref \n\ndecreased as the product passed through the evaporation tubes, decreasing its flow rate \n\nand increasing its viscosity. These two factors thus led to a lower Ref at the bottom of the \n\nthird tube compared to the first and second tubes for the same feed mass flow rate. \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n\n \n\nThe flow regimes at the bottom of the evaporation tubes are presented in Table 6.2. \n\nAlmost all products presented a wavy laminar profile, except T3 / 3R at 70 kg\u00b7h-1 and 60 \n\nkg\u00b7h-1 for which a laminar flow was deduced from Ref. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n\n \n\nTable 6.2.

RTD characterization \n\nTo improve understanding of the path of the skim milk fluid elements in the \n\nevaporator, and thereby improve the characterization of the flow in the FFE, the residence \n\ntime distribution (RTD) function was maintained. The RTD curves in the third run at a feed \n\nmass flow rate of 70 kg\u00b7h-1 are presented in Fig. 6.1. All curves had the same surface area. \n\nThe experimental RTD curves at 80 kg\u00b7h-1 and 60 kg\u00b7h-1 presented similar shapes. For all \n\nfeed mass flow rates and runs studied, a more highly concentrated product led to a lower \n\npeak on the curves and greater dispersion of the fluid elements. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1.

Only the feed \n\nflow rate and the distance covered by the product in the evaporator influenced this parameter. \n\nThe distance covered by the product of section ? was greater than section ?, which in \nturn was greater than section ?. Section ? represented the sum of the other three (Figure \n4.7). The product flow velocity was lower in section ?, as the product flow decreases due \nthe evaporation. \n\nThe maximum flow velocity, ?max, defined as the ratio of the length of a section over \n\ntmin for the product cover the section and calculated at the bottom of the tubes, is shown in \n\nTable 6.2. ?max was 0.33 \u00b1 0.01 m\u00b7s-1, 0.31 \u00b1 0.00 m\u00b7s-1 and 0.26 \u00b1 0.01 m\u00b7s-1, for T1 in the \n\nexperiments conducted at 80 kg\u00b7h-1, 70 kg\u00b7h-1 and 60 kg\u00b7h-1, respectively. ?max was 0.31 \u00b1 \n\n0.00 m\u00b7s-1, 0.23 \u00b1 0.00 m\u00b7s-1, 0.22 \u00b1 0.00 m\u00b7s-1 at 70 kg\u00b7h-1 for T1, T2 and T3, respectively, \n\nand ?max of section ? represented approximately the mean maximum velocity (0.25 m\u00b7s-1) \nof the three sections. In this study, ?max decreased as the product passed through the \n\nevaporation tubes. This was mainly due to the reduction in the mass flow rate due to product \n\nevaporation. \n\nThe mean residence time, ?, for a given section was the same for experiments \n\nconducted at a feed mass flow rate of 80 kg\u00b7h-1. At 70 kg\u00b7h-1and 60 kg\u00b7h-1, ? was higher in \n\nR3 for sections ? and ?. The increase in ? was assumed to be associated with a higher \nviscosity of the product, which in turn, is a key parameter for determining the flow regime. \n\nHigher liquid film dispersion contributed to a higher mean residence time of the product. \n\nWhen the flow regime changed from wavy-laminar to laminar flow, ? was increased. For the \n\nexperiments conducted in this study, the laminar flow regime has a mean residence time \n\nabove that of wavy-laminar flow, hence the lower mean velocity. \n\n\n\n \n\n128 \n\n \n\nThe evaporation rate decreases due the increase in the energy losses, possibly due \n\nto an increase in the product concentration, a decrease in the heat transfer coefficient, a \n\nchange in flow regime, a boiling delay phenomenon (i.e. product having a high boiling point \n\ndue to greater concentration of solutes), etc. When the evaporation rate decreased, the \n\nmass flow rate of the product concentrate decreased less compared to high evaporation \n\nrate, which also increased the flow velocity and therefore decreased the residence time of \n\nthe product. Measurement of the mean residence time was not sensitive to detect a \n\ndecrease in the mean residence time when the evaporation rate decreased very slightly. \n\nIt is of note that, one dimensionless number, Ref was used for determining the flow \n\nregime. In this work Ref described not only the flow regime, but also the mean residence \n\ntime of the product in the FFE. Where Ref &lt;25, in sections ? and ?, in 3R at 70 kg\u00b7h-1 \nand 60 kg\u00b7h-1, the flow behaviour changed from wavy-laminar to laminar flow and the mean \n\nresidence time of the product increased from 73 s to 77 s, 186 s to 196 s, 94 s to 106 s and \n\n231 s to 246 s, compared with 2R in the same section, where Ref > 25. In these experiments, \n\nto minimize heat treatment (time/temperature), which is an important factor in controlling \n\nfinal product quality, the flow regime of skim milk in FFE should be in the wavy-laminar \n\nregion, Ref > 25. This can be achieved by changing the operational parameters, i.e. mass \n\nflow rate, heating power, etc. In a recently work Gourdon et al. (2015) showed that the flow \n\nbehavior of whole and skim milk in FFE, was affected by total solids contents, flow rates and \n\ndriving temperature differences. \n\nAll experimental RTD curves for section ? presented shoulder areas at the end of \npassage through the FFE. These shoulders were also observed from section ? in the 2R \nat a feed mass flow rate of 80 kg\u00b7h-1 and 70 kg\u00b7h-1, and from section ? in the 2R, at a feed \nmass flow rate of 60 kg\u00b7h-1. \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n\n \n\nFig. 6.2 shows the models and experimental curves for the 3R of experiments \n\nconducted at a feed mass flow rate of 60 kg\u00b7h-1. For modelling the results of RTD, two reactor \n\nsets were used in parallel. This model represents two different flows, where a main and \n\nminor flow was represented by the reactor set A and B, respectively. The parameters used \n\nfor modelling each reactor set and the standard deviation between model and experimental \n\nRTD for all sections, runs and feed mass flow rates are presented in Table 6.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2.

Na could therefore be used to describe the dispersion in the residence time of the \n\nskim milk in FFE. A more highly concentrated product required a smaller number of tanks in \n\nseries, corresponding to greater dispersion of the product. Among the 27 skim milk \n\nconcentrations studied, the product with the lowest concentration, located at the bottom of \n\nT1 / 1R at 80 kg\u00b7h-1, had a value of Na = 14. This value decreased when the product was \n\nconcentrated. The value of the product with greater concentration at the bottom of T3 / 3R \n\nat 60 kg\u00b7h-1, was Na = 6. Function Eb(t), described a small fraction of the fluid elements and \n\nserved to explain the shoulder curves in the experimental RTD functions (Figures 6.2 and \n\n6.3). \n\nWhen the shoulders in the RTD curves did not occur, 99.9% of the product fluid \n\nelements passed through reactor set A, and the values of ?i and Ni were the same for both \n\nreactor sets. From the moment that the shoulders were observed, the product fluid elements \n\ngoing to reactor set A decreased and Nb and ?b increased, showing an increase in the fluid \n\nelements that passed through reactor set B. These fluid elements represented 0.9 % to 7 % \n\nof total skim milk fluid elements that entered the evaporator. At a feed mass flow rate of 80 \n\nkg\u00b7h-1, the fluid elements that passed through reactor set A decreased from 99.1 % to 96.0 % \n\nat T1 / R2 and T3 / R3, respectively. For section ? at T3 / R3, 4.0 %, 4.5 % and 5.0 % of \nfluid elements passed through reactor set B for the feed mass flow rates of 80 kg\u00b7h-1, 70 \n\nkg\u00b7h-1 and 60 kg\u00b7h-1, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n133 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3.

Comparison \nof different sections showed that the fluid elements going to reactor set A decreased when \n\nthe product concentration increased, and thus an increase in the shoulders at the end of \n\nRTD curves was observed. \n\nAs mentioned before, the model used in this study takes into account a main and a \n\nminor flow. For the experiments when the shoulders in the RTD curves were noted, the \n\nminor flow should be considerate as a retarded flow (Fig. 6.3), due to the high mean \n\nresidence time presented. These two different flows possibly flow in two layers: \n\n\u2022 One representing a small proportion of the fluid elements, demonstrated by \n\nreactor set B, where the layer of product flows in contact with the walls of the evaporation \n\ntubes; and \n\n\u2022 One layer flowing over the first, in the center of the evaporation tubes, \n\nrepresenting a greater proportion of the product fluid elements, demonstrated by reactor set \n\nA. \n\nIncreased viscosity in the FFE results in increased film thickness (Gray, 1981), that \n\ncould be caused by an increase in the flowing fluid elements in contact with the surface of \n\nthe evaporation tubes. This layer would be decelerated by friction forces, surface tension, \n\nviscosity, etc. and thus present a longer residence time. On the other hand, the majority of \n\nthe product may flow in a superimposed layer, where the above deceleration forces have a \n\nminor influence, thus contributing to a higher flow velocity and shorter residence time. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n\n \n\n6.4.  Additional information \n\nThe RTD functions of water during the process of vacuum evaporation in FFE were \n\nalso measured. \n\nThe tmin and vmax (Table 6.4) of the experiments conducted with water had similar \n\nvalues (37 s, 52 s, 60 s and 149 s, for sections ?, ?, ? and ?, respectively) to those \nobtained in the experiments conducted with skim milk in the same operating conditions (inlet \n\nmass flow rate of 70 kg\u00b7h-1), demonstrating that the viscosity did not influence these \n\nparameters. \n\nThe experiments with water had a higher value of Ref in comparison with skim milk \n\nexperiments (Table 6.1 and 6.4). This increase in the values of Ref may have been due to \n\nthe low viscosity of water (0.46\u00b710-3 Pa\u00b7s \u2013 Table 5.1), since the evaporation rate and \n\ntherefore the flow rate at the bottom of the tubes remains constant for the experiments with \n\nwater and milk (\u00a7 5.4.3). The flow profile for water experiments was therefore characterized \n\nas turbulent (Ref > 1000 \u2013 \u00a7 4.8). \n\nThe mean residence time of the water particles in the evaporator equipment had the \n\nsame values as that of skim milk experiments when compared to the same section in the \n\n1R and 2R. This parameter only changed when the flow profile changed from wavy-laminar \n\nto laminar flow. Therefore only the laminar flow profile affected the mean residence time of \n\nthe particles during concentration in the FFE. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n136 \n\n \n\nTable 6.4.

Conclusion \n\nThe Ref provided information about the mean residence time of the skim milk flow in \n\nthe FFE. The mean residence time of the product was higher when the flow regime was \n\ncharacterized as laminar flow. The flow behavior of water experiments was characterized as \n\nturbulent flow. The flow velocity in wavy-laminar and turbulent conditions was the same, but \n\nthis parameter was higher than in the laminar conditions. For the same operating parameters, \n\nwater experiments in turbulent flow had the same mean residence time that skim milk flowing \n\nin wavy-laminar conditions \n\nThe RTD approach provided greater understanding of the flow in FFE. The \n\nconcentration affected the dispersion of flow in the FFE but not the time required for the first \n\nparticles to exit from the evaporator: the more concentrated the product, the greater the \n\ndispersion of its particles. The change in tmin was affected by the mass flow rate and section \n\n(distance covered by the product). \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n\n \n\nSome RTD curves exhibited shoulders at the ends. This phenomenon characterized \n\na part of the product that followed another path in the FFE. The flow is comprised of two \n\ndifferent flows. The minor flow represented by reactor set B, was in contact with the inner \n\nsurface of the tube and had a longer mean residence time. The second flow, demonstrated \n\nby reactor set A and representing the main fraction of product, flowed over the first layer, \n\nand had a shorter mean residence time compared to the first layer. \n\nThe model with two reactor sets in parallel was effective in modelling the RTD curves. \n\nThis model allowed calculation of the amount of product that took different paths in the FFE, \n\nand helped to improve understanding of the flow of skim milk in FFE. \n\nThe future of this work involves combining the RTD approach with different products \n\nand operating conditions in the evaporator. These parameters can be accessed either by \n\nmodelling or by measurement, and will make it possible to describe the time/temperature \n\nhistory of the product, and to establish further correlations with changes in constituents and \n\noperating parameters. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n138 \n\n \n\nChapter 7 \nAPPLICATION OF RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION \n\nAPPROACH TO DIFFERENT DAIRY PRODUCTS TO INDICATE \n\nFOULING DURING CONCENTRATION IN A FALLING FILM \n\nEVAPORATOR \n\nThe aim of this chapter is to use the residence time distribution approach to indicate \n\nfouling caused by the concentration of dairy products in a falling film evaporator (FFE), such \n\nas skim milk (SM), sweet whey (SW) and lactic acid whey (LAW). The extent of fouling was \n\ndetermined by measuring the heat transfer coefficient (U), energy efficiency, outlet mass \n\nflow rate and mean residence time of the concentrates. The heat transfer coefficient and the \n\nmean residence time of the SM concentrate did not change during the 420 min experiment. \n\nHowever, these two parameters gradually decreased with time for the experiments with SW \n\nand LAW. When fouling occurred, both the heat transfer coefficient and the mean residence \n\ntime decreased, due to a decrease in the evaporation rate. No significant loss of SM \n\ncomponents was identified after evaporation. However, a decrease in mineral content was \n\nobserved for SW experiments over the processing time. This chapter demonstrates how to \n\napply RTD on different dairy products and relate several operating parameters, such as \n\nsteam and product temperature, product flow and conductivity, etc., to indicate fouling \n\nformation in a falling film evaporators. The results of this Chapter will be submitted at Journal \n\nof Dairy Science1. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe main aims of this chapter are to: \n\n- Use the RTD approach to indicate fouling in falling film evaporators \n\n- Relate the operating parameters to dairy fouling \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n\n \n\n1 To be Submitted in October 2015 in the Journal of Dairy Science: Silveira, A.C.P., \nTanguy, G., Perrone, \u00cd.T., Jeantet, R., Fromont, L., Le Floch-Fou\u00e9r\u00e9, C., de Carvalho, \nA.F., Schuck, P., Residence time distribution functions - application at different dairy \nproducts to indicate fouling during concentration in a falling film evaporator. \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n\n \n\nCap\u00edtulo 7 \nAPLICA\u00c7\u00c3O DA METODOLOGIA DE DISTRIBUI\u00c7\u00c3O DOS TEMPOS DE \n\nRESID\u00caNCIA NO MONITORAMENTO DO FOULING DURANTE A \n\nCONCENTRA\u00c7\u00c3O DE DIFERENTES PRODUTOS L\u00c1CTEOS EM UM \n\nEVAPORADOR DE PEL\u00cdCULA DESCENDENTE \n\nO objetivo deste cap\u00edtulo \u00e9 usar a metodologia do c\u00e1lculo da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos tempos \n\nde resid\u00eancia para monitorar a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fouling causados pela concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nprodutos l\u00e1cteos em um evaporador de pel\u00edcula descendente (EPD), tais como leite \n\ndesnatado, soro de leite doce e soro de leite \u00e1cido.

Introduction \n\nFalling film evaporators (FFE) are widely used in the chemical, refrigeration, \n\npetroleum refining, desalination and food industries (Kouhikamali et al., 2014). Their appeal \n\nis mainly due to the high heat transfer coefficient, low evaporation temperature and small \n\ntemperature differences between the product and the steam (Silveira et al., 2015). FFE is a \n\ncommonly used method in the dairy industry for the production of final (sweetened \n\ncondensed milk, evaporated milk, etc.; G\u00e4nzle et al., 2008) and intermediate products before \n\nany further operations such as crystallization, precipitation, coagulation and drying (infant \n\nformulae, whey and milk powders, etc.) (Bimbenet et al., 2007; Schuck, 2002; Zhu et al., \n\n2011). Unfortunately a fouling layer accumulates on the inner wall of the evaporator tubes \n\nduring processing, impairing optimal functioning of the equipment (Jeurnink et al., 1996), \n\nand resulting in a decrease in the heat transfer coefficient, an increased pressure drop and \n\nthe formation of a biofilm (Langeveld et al., 1990; Visser and Jeurnink, 1997). \n\nBecause of the decrease in the heat transfer coefficient that results from fouling, \n\nmost evaporators do not have a constant production capacity. In petrochemical industries, \n\npipe cleaning is carried out once a year, whereas in food-processing industries, it has to be \n\ndone at least once a day (Ozden and Puri, 2010). The high frequency of cleaning periods \n\nresults in shorter production times and higher consumption of water and cleaning agents, \n\nincreasing economic costs and need to address ecological issues (Jimenez et al., 2013). \n\nVacuum evaporators are heat exchangers, in which the major factors likely to \n\ngenerate fouling during the heat treatment of milk are the formation and the subsequent \n\ndeposition of denatured whey protein molecules, the precipitation of minerals as a result of \n\nthe decreasing solubility of calcium phosphates with increasing temperature, and the \n\ntemperature difference between the heating surface and the liquid to be heated (Lalande \n\nand Tissier, 1985; W. R. Paterson, 1988). \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\n \n\nFouling during heat treatment is particularly problematic with concentrated products. \n\nSchraml and Kessler (1994) reported that during pasteurization of whey products, fouling \n\nincreased to a maximum concentration of 250 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids (TS), after which \n\ndeposition decreased. The reason for the decrease was thought to result from two \n\ncompeting mechanisms: aggregation of whey proteins, which is a second order reaction and \n\ncrystallization of salts, manly calcium phosphate (Fryer et al., 2011). \n\nMost studies on fouling and cleaning in the area of food engineering relate to \n\npasteurization and sterilization processes, where temperatures are greater than 70\u00b0C. Chen \n\nand Bala (1998) showed that surface temperatures need to be above 70\u00b0C for significant \n\nsurface fouling of milk to occur, but most milk evaporator parts operate below this \n\ntemperature (Morison, 2015). Most of the fouling in milk evaporators should therefore not be \n\nassumed to be the same as the fouling reported in the case of sterilizers and pasteurizers. \n\nThe progress made towards the reduction of fouling in FFE has been largely \n\nempirical. The aim of this study was therefore to demonstrate how to monitor the formation \n\nand extent of fouling in FFE using operating process data and how the formation of fouling \n\ncontributes to modification of the process parameters and product quality. \n\n7.2.  Materials and Methods \n\n7.2.1.  Pilot vacuum evaporator \n\nThe experiments were performed with the pilot scale, single stage falling film \n\nevaporator with the additional instrumentation (described in Chapter 4.2.2). \n\nAll experiments were performed at an absolute pressure (Pabs) of 0.02 MPa, and thus \n\nthe saturation temperature of evaporation was maintained at 60 \u00b0C throughout the three \n\ntubes. \n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n\n7.2.2.  Experimental runs \n\nExperimental runs were carried out from a single experiment with concentrated \n\nsolutions of skim milk (SM), sweet whey (SW) and lactic acid whey (LAW), at a feed mass \n\nflow rate of 70 kg\u00b7h-1. \n\nSM was reconstituted at 235.1 g\u00b7kg-1 of total solids (TS) from skim milk powder \n\n(Lactalis ingredients, Bourgbarr\u00e9, France). Fresh concentrated SW and LAW were obtained \n\nfrom an industrial cheese manufacturer in Brittany (France) at 252.2 g\u00b7kg-1 and 257.7 g\u00b7kg-\n\n1, respectively. The products were heated at 60\u00b0C in a preheater (Fig. 4.7) before entering \n\nthe evaporator. \n\nThe outlet concentrates were collected and analyzed after 30 min, and then every \n\n90 min (120 min, 210 min, 300 min and 390 min) during the evaporation process. For SM \n\nexperiments the total process time was 420 min. For LAW and SW experiments, due the \n\nhigh levels of fouling deposits on the temperature and conductivity probes, the evaporator \n\nhad to be stopped for manual cleaning of the probes. After cleaning the probes, the \n\nevaporator was re-started, and the operating conditions reestablished before resubmitting \n\nthe product. Two stops of 60 minutes each were made for SW experiments, and one of 60 \n\nminutes and another of 30 minutes for LAW experiments. \n\n7.2.3.  Chemical composition \n\nThe feed and final total solids (TS), whey protein and ash content were determined \n\naccording to section 4.4.1, 4.4.5 and 4.4.6, respectively. \n\n7.2.4.  Enthalpy characterization \n\nThe overall heat transfer coefficient (U) was used to predict the extent of fouling in \n\nthe last tube of the evaporator equipment. This parameter was calculated only for the last \n\ntube because the mass flow rate of the product was lowest at this point, leading to a lower \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\n \n\nwetting rate of the tubes and higher concentration, viscosity and resistance to heat transfer \n\n(Morison et al., 2006). It could therefore be expected that the formation of fouling should be \n\ngreater than in the other two tubes. \n\nMass and enthalpy balance, overall heat transfer coefficient and assessment of \n\nprocess efficiency were calculated as described in chapter 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7, respectively. \n\n7.2.5.  Measurement of residence time distribution \n\nResidence time distributions functions were calculated and modeled for the inlet to \n\nthe outlet of the evaporator equipment (section ?) as described in 4.9.  \n\n7.3.  Results and Discussion \n\nThe total heat transfer coefficient was used to estimate the extent of fouling in the \n\nFFE, as described in Bermingham et al. (1999). Fig. 7.1 shows the evolution of U as a \n\nfunction of time for the three concentrated solutions studied. The blanks in the values of U \n\nfor SW and LAW experiments corresponded to stops during the evaporation process to \n\nclean the conductivity and temperature probes (Fig. 4.7) and restarting of the evaporator. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 7.1.

The values of \n\nU, calculated according to Eq. 4.4, were: 2.33 kW\u00b7m-2?\u00b0C-1, 2.52 kW\u00b7m-2?\u00b0C-1, and 2.11 kW\u00b7m-\n\n2?\u00b0C-1, for SM, SW and LAW, respectively. Jebson and Chen (1997) obtained values for U \n\nbetween 0.8 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 and 3.08 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 for whole milk measured in several milk \n\npowder factories; Jebson and Iyer (1991) found values for U between 2.00 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 and \n\n3.50 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 for skim milk concentrated in five-effect evaporators. The small difference \n\nbetween the values of U for the three solutions studied at t = 0 may therefore be considered \n\nnegligible on the scale of the experimental reproducibility. Moreover, the U values at the \n\nbeginning of the process were similar whatever the dairy product to the mean value of 2.00 \n\nkW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 reported by Silveira et al. (2013) for the same equipment. \n\nThe value of U for the SM experiments remained constant during the 420 min of the \n\nevaporation process, which indicated that no fouling was present. Reconstituted milk results \n\nin less fouling than fresh milk, possibly explained by the fact that the materials which are \n\nresponsible for forming the deposits on the heat exchanger surface has been partially \n\nremoved during powder manufacture or are less active (e.g. denatured proteins already \n\naggregated, or calcium phosphates already precipitated) after this step. For example, \n\ncalcium concentration and ion activity is reduced by 9% and 11%, respectively (Jeurnink et \n\nal., 1996). Each of these factors may have contributed to the absence of fouling in SM \n\nexperiments. \n\nFor SW and LAW experiments, U gradually decreased over time, indicating the \n\nprogressive formation of fouling. This decrease was more pronounced in LAW experiments. \n\nSW resulted in more fouling than SM due to the absence of casein micelles. Indeed, caseins \n\nhinder the transport of whey protein aggregates to the surface, and affect the association of \n\nwhey proteins with calcium ions, thus resulting in aggregates less prone to fouling (Jeurnink \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n\n \n\net al., 1996; Jeurnink, 1995; Varunsatian et al., 1983). LAW showed the highest fouling \n\nformation over time. As the pH of this concentrated solution is closer to the isoelectric point \n\nof whey proteins, leading to less electrostatic repulsion, the increased fouling formation \n\ncould be due to greater probability of adsorption of whey proteins to the protein layer \n\ndeposited and thus complexation of minerals for the protein layer. \n\nTable 7.1 shows the enthalpy balance values for the three dairy products studied. \n\nThe EE decreased when fouling was identified. The EE was constant (77 \u00b1 3 %) for SM \n\nexperiments, since there was no fouling. The EE decreased from 73 % to 62 % and from \n\n75 % to 62 %, for SW and LAW experiments, respectively. This decrease was due to the \n\nincrease in the heat transfer resistance between the steam and the product due to the fouling \n\nlayer on the evaporator walls. However, the energy losses, q??, calculated according Eq. 4.3, \nremained constant and equal to a similar value (7 \u00b1 1 %) to that found by Silveira et al. (2013) \n\nwhatever the product. As q?? corresponds to the energy dissipated toward the evaporator \nenvironment, its value was not affected by fouling. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n149 \n\n \n\nTable 7.1.

However, the evaporation rate was constant for the SW experiments (25.3 \u00b1 \n\n0.4 kg\u00b7h-1), although U of the third tube decreased throughout the processing time. The small \n\ndecrease in U during SW experiments was not sufficient to affect the evaporation rate. \n\nAs discussed above, the formation of a fouling layer on the evaporator wall \n\ndecreased the heat flow from the steam for the product, resulting in a decrease in the \n\nevaporation rate. Fouling thus caused a decrease in the concentration of the outlet product, \n\nfrom 398.5 g\u00b7kg-1 to 389.7 g\u00b7kg-1 and from 414.2 g\u00b7kg-1 to 351.2 g\u00b7kg-1 for the SW and LAW \n\nProcess time Product Skim milk Sweet whey \nLactic acid \n\nwhey \n\n30 min \n\nMass flow rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 44.0 \u00b1 1.5 44.3 \u00b1 3.9 43.4 \u00b1 3.6 \n\nEvaporation rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 26.0 25.7 26.6 \n\nTS (g\u00b7kg-1) 374.0 398.5 414.2 \n\n120 min \n\nMass flow rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 44.4 \u00b1 1.4 44.7 \u00b1 4.2 47.0 \u00b1 3.8 \n\nEvaporation rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 26.6 25.3 23.3 \n\nTS (g\u00b7kg-1) 398.0 394.8 383.4 \n\n210 min \n\nMass flow rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 43.1 \u00b1 1.4 44.5 \u00b1 4.1 51.3 \u00b1 4.2 \n\nEvaporation rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 26.9 25.5 18.7 \n\nTS (g\u00b7kg-1) 381.8 396.3 351.2 \n\n300 min \n\nMass flow rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 44.1 \u00b1 1.9 45.3 \u00b1 4.4 - \n\nEvaporation rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 25.9 24.7 - \n\nTS (g\u00b7kg-1) 373.2 389.7 - \n\n390 min \n\nMass flow rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 43.0 \u00b1 1.7 - - \n\nEvaporation rate (kg\u00b7h-1) 27.0 - - \n\nTS (g\u00b7kg-1) 368.2 - - \n\n\n\n \n\n151 \n\n \n\nexperiments, respectively. This decrease is more important to LAW due to a higher fouling \n\nformation presented by this product. \n\nTable 7.3 shows the mean residence time, ?, of the three dairy products studied, \n\ncalculated at different process times. As the operating parameters did not change for SM \n\nexperiments, its ? was the same, 298 \u00b1 1 s, throughout the process. However, ? decreased \n\nthroughout the process for SW and LAW experiments. It decreased from 298 s at t = 30 min \n\nto 264 s at 210 min (Table 7.3) for LAW experiments. An increase in the outlet concentrate \n\nflow rate, and therefore in the flow speed of the product in FFE, was observed with fouling \n\nformation, in accordance with the decrease in the mean residence time determined here. \n\nThe mean residence time thus decreased with fouling formation. However, the outlet mass \n\nflow rate of SW concentrates did not alter until 210 min, but nevertheless ? decreased. This \n\nshows that ? is not only influenced by the mass flow rate, but by other factors such a product \n\nconcentration, flow profile and product interactions with the wall of the evaporator, etc. \n\n(Silveira et al., 2015). These findings indicate that ? expresses the extent of fouling in a more \n\naccurate way than the mass flow rate of concentrate. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n152 \n\n \n\nTable 7.3.

The composition of the SM product remained constant before and after evaporation, as \n\nfouling was not evidenced for this experiment. For the SW experiments, a decrease in \n\nminerals was identified at 210 min: ash content values decreased from 6.1 % to 5.3 % \n\nbetween t = 120 min and t = 210 min, respectively. This may have been due to mineral \n\nprecipitation contributing to the formation of mineral deposits on the wall of the evaporator \n\ntubes. A high fouling rate was identified for the LAW experiments (Fig. 7.1), although the \n\ncomposition of the product before and after evaporation remained constant. This \n\nphenomenon contradicts the loss of product components due to deposit formation. This may \n\nbe explained by the high concentration of minerals in the LAW products (14.6 % in dry \n\nmatter), especially calcium and phosphate. Even with a loss of minerals in the deposit \n\n(fouling formation), this loss (mass deposited on the wall of the evaporator tube) was much \n\nlower than the mineral content in the product, and was therefore not identified. The SW \n\nproduct presented a smaller quantity of minerals than LAW, and thus a small loss of mineral \n\ncontent caused a decrease in the mineral content in the final product, which could then be \n\nidentified. \n\n\n\n \n\n153 \n\n \n\nTable 7.4.

The U values \n\nfor the three concentrated solutions studied remained constant over the process time in T2 \n\n(2.5 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1, 2.7 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 and 2.2 kW\u00b7m-2\u00b7\u00b0C-1 for SM, SW and LAW, respectively), \n\ntherefore no fouling formation was detected in these tubes during the process. \n\nFor SW experiments, fouling was identified only in T3 (Fig. 7.1), where the higher \n\nconcentration and the lower flow rate of the product (end of the evaporation process) may \n\nhave been the cause. For LAW experiments, fouling was identified in T1 and T3 (decrease \n\nin U over time) (Fig. 7.1 and 7.2 \u2013 B). Even with a higher concentration and lower product \n\nflow rate in T2 than in T1, fouling was not identified in this tube. This result shows that the \n\nLAW particles in the concentration range studied, which were more susceptible to the \n\nformation of fouling, attached to the wall of the evaporator tube more rapidly when submitted \n\nto a temperature difference (between heat steam and product evaporation temperature), \n\n\n\n \n\n156 \n\n \n\nthus producing a fouling layer on the wall of this tube. The fouling identified in T3 must be \n\ndue at a higher concentration and a lower mass flow rate of the product at this point, leading \n\nto a lower wetting rate of the tube and a higher heat transfer resistance in T3 than in the \n\nother evaporator tubes. \n\nTable 7.5 shows the operating parameters of the vacuum evaporator process and \n\nthe physical-chemical properties of the three products studied at different process times for \n\nT1 and T2. As no fouling formation was identified in T1 and T2 for SM and SW experiments, \n\nthe evaporation rate in these tubes remained constant. The evaporation rate was 8.5 \u00b1 0.3 \n\nkg\u00b7h-1 and 9.2 \u00b1 0.3 kg\u00b7h-1 for T1 and T2, respectively. \n\nTable 7.5.

This result was similar to those \n\nfound and discussed in Chapter 5, where the evaporation rate between different products \n\n(in process conditions without fouling) had the same values. \n\nFor the experiments performed with lactic acid whey, the evaporation rate in T1 \n\ndecreased over the process time (8.3 kg\u00b7h-1, 5.7 kg\u00b7h-1 and 2.7 kg\u00b7h-1 at 30 min, 120 min \n\nand 210 min, respectively). This decrease in the evaporation rate was due to the high fouling \n\nformation in the evaporator tube and in the preheater (installed at the equipment inlet (Fig. \n\n4.7)), which increased the resistance of heat exchange between the hot fluid and the product. \n\nThe lactic acid whey thus entered the equipment at a temperature below the evaporation \n\ntemperature. As consequence part of heat exchanged by the steam in T1 was used to heat \n\nthe product until its evaporation temperature (60\u00b0C) and not to evaporate it. This \n\nphenomenon, combined with the fouling formation in T1, contributed to a low evaporation \n\nrate in the first tube for lactic acid whey experiments. \n\nThe values presented above (Table 7.3) correspond to the mean residence time of \n\nsection ? (inlet to the outlet of the evaporator equipment). Table 7.6 shows the mean \n\nresidence times for SM, SW and LAW in the vacuum evaporator equipment calculated at \n\ndifferent process times and sections ?, ? and ?. The mean residence time, measured \n\nin the same section, was constant for the SM experiments during all processing times. The \n\nmean residence time for SW experiments only changed in section ? and after t = 120 min. \n\nThis result was similar to that found in section ? (Table 7.3), indicating that the formation \n\nof fouling in the SW experiment occurred only in the last evaporator tube (T3). \n\nThe mean residence time for LAW experiments decreased over the evaporation \n\nprocess for section ?. Therefore in section ? at t = 30 min this value was the same as \n\n\n\n \n\n158 \n\n \n\nthat of the SM and SW experiments. This result also shows that at t = 30 min, the formation \n\nof fouling in T1 was not sufficient to decrease the evaporation rate of the LAW experiments. \n\nThe mean residence time in section ? for LAW experiments was constant until t = 120 min \n\n(56 s), decreasing at t = 210 min (52 s), although no fouling was detected and the \n\nevaporation rate was constant in this section (9.3 kg\u00b7h-1). This result was due to a lower \n\nevaporation rate in the previous evaporation tube (2.7 kg\u00b7h-1 \u2013 Table 7.5), thus causing an \n\nincrease in product flow rate in sections ? and ? (T2 and T3). The increase in the product \n\nflow rate led to a decrease in the mean product residence time. \n\nTable 7.6.

Conclusions \n\nThe residence time distribution approach was used to indicate fouling in a falling film \n\nevaporator during concentration of skim milk, sweet whey and lactic acid whey. Fouling was \n\nmonitored by the calculation of the overall heat transfer coefficient, the energy efficiency, \n\nthe evaporation rate and the mean residence time. During the concentration of sweet and \n\nlactic acid whey a decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient, evaporation rate and \n\nenergy efficiency occurred over the processing time. These phenomena were related to the \n\nformation of fouling deposits on the walls of evaporator tubes. The mean residence times of \n\nthe products in the falling film evaporator were calculated. A decrease in this parameter was \n\nobserved as a function of time. This phenomenon was related to the increase in the flow \n\nrate, due the fouling formation and therefore an increase of the product flow velocity, which \n\nin turn contributed to a low mean residence time. This parameter was more sensitive to \n\nidentify fouling than the other operating parameters used in this study. \n\nThe composition of the three concentrated dairy products was measured before and \n\nafter concentration in the equipment. No significant loss of skim milk components was \n\nidentified after evaporation. A decrease in mineral content was observed in the sweet whey \n\nexperiment. Despite the high fouling rate identified in the lactic acid whey experiment, the \n\ncomposition of this product remained constant before and after evaporation. This \n\nphenomenon was related to the higher concentration of minerals in the lactic acid whey. The \n\nloss of this component in the deposits formed was much lower than the mass of minerals \n\npresent in the product, which was therefore not identified. \n\nAs these results were obtained from a single experiment, they need to be confirmed \n\nby further experiments. The work will be then submitted in the Journal of Dairy Science. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n160 \n\n \n\nGE?ERAL C??CLUSI?? \n \n\nIn the current context of intensification of global exchange, concentration and drying \n\ntechniques are crucial for the dairy industry and this warrants investment in new types of \n\nconcentration and drying research. Despite the fact that falling film evaporation is a widely \n\nused technique prior to the drying process, some essential aspects of the process such as \n\nproduct flow regime, residence time distribution, or key factors controlling product properties, \n\netc., are not yet fully understood, thus resulting in variability of concentrate quality and \n\nprocess performance. As the concentrate properties contributes to the powder properties, \n\nthe understanding of the vacuum evaporation process, especially with regards to \n\nmodifications of the product by the process operating parameters, needs to be improved in \n\norder to predict the final product techno-functional properties. \n\nThis thesis reviewed experimental thermodynamic and hydrodynamic studies based \n\non the falling film evaporation of various dairy products. The study focused first on the \n\nevaporation of water, as a model solution (Newtonian behavior), then on skim milk, whole \n\nmilk, sweet whey and lactic acid whey, which are involved in the elaboration of several dried \n\ndairy products, such as infant formulas and fitness products (e.g. Whey protein isolates). \n\nThe first part of this PhD project aimed to instrument and characterize a pilot scale, falling \n\nfilm evaporator (FFE) that would, from a hydrodynamic point of view, describe the same \n\nprocess as the industrial equipment. The choice and position of the sensors used for the \n\ninstrumentation of this pilot equipment, as well as the calculation of energy consumption and \n\nprocess performance, can be applied to industrial scale evaporators.  \n\nSeveral operating data such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, conductivity, etc. \n\nwere measured and recorded for the characterization of the vacuum evaporation process. \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n\n \n\nThe sensors used for these measurements were positioned at different points in the \n\nequipment, in order to achieve thermodynamic balances and to monitor product dry matter \n\nduring its concentration. The thermodynamic balances of the process made it possible to \n\nidentify some limitations of the original equipment, such as poor distribution of certain \n\nproducts at the top of the evaporator tubes, barely regulation of the water sensor valves of \n\nthe heating systems and lower wettability rate of the evaporator tubes for the products with \n\nhigher total solids content, which resulted in a decrease in the evaporation rate. A cone-\n\nshaped concave distributor system was designed, the heating regulation was improved and \n\nthe inlet flow rate of the product was adjusted in order to overcome this limitations and to \n\nprovide a sufficient wettability rate of the evaporator tubes for products with higher \n\nconcentrations. \n\nOnly the operating parameter (heating power, inlet product flow rate, etc.) modified \n\nthe evaporation rate. Indeed, the evaporation rate calculated for given operating parameters \n\nvalues was constant, regardless of the product. It is of note that the heat transfer surface of \n\nthis pilot (1.03 m2) is much lower than industrial scale evaporators considering the scale \n\nreduction applied. The results of the effectiveness of evaporation showed that suitable \n\ninstrumentation (choice and siting of the sensors in the vacuum evaporation equipment) can \n\nresult in good thermodynamic balance and identification of possible problems, thus \n\nimproving the process performance. \n\nThe second stage of this PhD project involved a hydrodynamic characterization of \n\nthe vacuum evaporation process. Residence time distribution functions were used to \n\ncharacterize the flow profile of skim milk at three different total inlet solids and feed mass \n\nflow rates during its concentration in the three different sections of the FFE, and for the entire \n\nFFE (from the inlet to the outlet of the equipment). Methodology for the calculation of the \n\nexperimental RTD curves, as well a model and the physical interpretation of this were also \n\n\n\n \n\n162 \n\n \n\ndeveloped. A combination of two perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series (reactor sets A and \n\nB) was developed to model the experimental RTD functions. Flow was characterized using \n\nexperimental film Reynolds numbers (Ref). The results showed that the mean residence \n\ntime of the product increased when the flow behavior changed from wavy-laminar to laminar \n\nflow. Increasing the concentration of skim milk and the distance covered by the product \n\nresulted in an increase in the dispersion of the particles. \n\nThe model with two reactor sets in parallel was effective to model the RTD curves, \n\nin view of the very low standard deviations obtained. From the model interpretations, a main \n\nand a minor flow, consisting in two layers of product flowing through the evaporator tubes, \n\nwere proposed. The minor flow would flow in contact with the inner surface of the tube and \n\nhad a longer mean residence time. The main flow, which represented most of the product \n\nparticles, would flow over the first layer, and had a shorter mean residence time. \n\nThe last part of this PhD thesis consisted in the application of the thermodynamic \n\nand hydrodynamic approaches used to characterize the vacuum evaporation process. A \n\nstudy on the fouling during the concentration of skim milk, sweet and lactic acid whey during \n\nconcentration in a FFE was performed. The results confirmed that lactic acid whey presented \n\nthe greatest degree of fouling formation, followed by sweet whey. No fouling formation was \n\nidentified for the skim milk experiment over the processing time of 420 min. However, this \n\ntime may not have been sufficient for formation of skim milk fouling. \n\nThe formation of fouling deposits on the walls of the evaporation tubes contributed \n\nto a decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient, due to a greater resistance to be \n\ncrossed by the heat flow. Therefore, an increase in the concentrated flow rate was observed \n\nwith the increase in fouling formation due to a decrease of the evaporation rate. The \n\nevolution of these operating parameters thus caused a change in mean residence time, i.e. \n\n\n\n \n\n163 \n\n \n\na decrease in the heat transfer coefficient (U) leading to a decrease in the product mean \n\nresidence time (?). However and despite the decrease of mean residence time, U and \n\nproduct mass flow rate remained almost constant whatever the processing time and the \n\nfouling deposit. This means that ? is not only influenced by the mass flow rate, but by other \n\nfactors such as product concentration, flow profile and product interactions with the wall of \n\nthe evaporator. These findings also indicate that ? variation due to fouling is more sensitive \n\nthan the heat transfer coefficient and evaporation rate changes, it is another tool to fouling \n\ndetection. \n\nBesides, no significant loss of skim milk components was identified after evaporation. \n\nHowever, a decrease in mineral content was observed over the processing time in the sweet \n\nwhey experiment. Despite the high fouling rate identified in the lactic acid whey experiment \n\nrelated to the higher concentration of minerals in the lactic acid whey, the composition of \n\nlactic acid whey remained constant before and after evaporation. Even with a loss of \n\nminerals in the deposit (fouling formation), this loss was minor compared to the mineral \n\ncontent of the product, and could not therefore be identified. The sweet whey product \n\npresented a smaller quantity of minerals than lactic acid whey, and thus a small loss of \n\nmineral content caused a decrease in the mineral content in the final product, which could \n\nthen be identified. Several operating parameters, such as steam and product temperature, \n\nproduct flow, conductivity and mean residence time were used to indicate the fouling \n\nformation of different dairy products in a FFE. \n\nFinally, the main innovative result of the PhD project was to highlight the impact of \n\nappropriate instrumentation combined with the understanding provided by process \n\nengineering that resulted in good characterization of the falling film evaporation process, \n\nwhich is an important operation in the dryer dairy industry in terms of energy consumption \n\nand final powder quality. This study emphasized the crucial role of process characterization \n\n\n\n \n\n164 \n\n \n\nto improve the performance of FFE and product quality. Characterization of the evaporator \n\nprocess thus represents a potential way to tune process performance and thus achieve the \n\nanticipated functional properties of a concentrate. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n165 \n\n \n\nFUTURE ?UTL??K \n \n\nThe initial framework of this PhD project comprised a study of the vacuum \n\nevaporation process performed in a falling film evaporator. Despite being an important \n\noperation used to concentrate solutions in the food industry, there are few scientific papers \n\nconcerning the concentration of dairy products in falling film evaporators. The industry has \n\nachieved expertise in this domain in an empirical way. This study presents approaches to \n\nthermodynamic and hydrodynamic characterization of the falling film vacuum evaporation \n\nprocess, which is an essential step for studies of the interactions between product and \n\nprocess. The main focus of the future outlook is therefore modifications of the product during \n\nits concentration in a falling film evaporator. Considerable effort will be required in order to \n\nintegrate understanding of the vacuum evaporation process into concentrate quality control \n\nand process performance. Specific development of new products will depend on the final \n\napplication of the concentrate and therefore on its physicochemical and microbiological \n\nproperties (protein denaturation, flavor, color reactions, nutritional aspects, etc.). \n\nOverall, this PhD project is an investigative study which demonstrated that good \n\ncharacterization of the process can provide valuable information on the optimal performance \n\nof the process and on final concentrate properties. From this starting point, various \n\ninvestigations can be proposed, in order both to consolidate any hypothesis developed in \n\nthe PhD project and to extend understanding of modifications of product properties during \n\nvacuum evaporation and their likely influence on the performance of the process. Three key \n\npoints emerged: i.e. control of product quality during the vacuum evaporation process, \n\nfouling formation and cleaning procedures. \n\n\n\n \n\n166 \n\n \n\nControl of product quality during the vacuum evaporation process using residence \n\ntime distribution functions \n\nAs it is possible to calculate the residence time distribution function (RTD), and \n\ntherefore the exact time that a given proportion of product particles takes to pass through \n\nthe evaporator, the temperature profile of the product can be calculated during concentration \n\nin the vacuum evaporation process, because the evaporation temperature in such pilot \n\nequipment can be kept constant. \n\nThe residence time distribution of a product in the vacuum evaporator equipment \n\ndepends, among other things, on the operating parameters, such as the flow rate, \n\nevaporation temperature, heating power, etc. Study of the influence of the operating \n\nparameters on the RTD of different products will therefore provide elements to create models \n\nfor prediction of changes in the minimum, mean and maximum product residence times. \n\nThis information, combined with the temperature profile of the product, can thus be used to \n\nmonitor some characteristics of the product during its concentration such as the rate of \n\nprotein denaturation, destruction and / or growth of microorganisms, destruction of vitamins, \n\nMaillard reaction rate, etc. This information will make it possible to produce products with \n\nspecific nutritional and techno-functional qualities, such as gelling properties and water \n\nbinding capacity, and to optimize sensory properties (aroma, taste, and mouth-feel). Another \n\napplication of the RTD function is in the study of fouling formation and cleaning procedures \n\nof the falling film evaporator. \n\nFouling formation \n\nThe extent of fouling formation of different dairy products during concentration was \n\nstudied in a falling film evaporator. It was shown that fouling formation throughout the \n\nprocess time in the same operating conditions depends on the composition of the product. \n\n\n\n \n\n167 \n\n \n\nThe mass of the deposit formed for different products and operating parameters should \n\ntherefore be measured and its composition determined. This requires methodology that \n\nensures the complete removal of the deposit formed on the inner walls of the evaporator \n\ntubes. \n\nA device for collecting the deposit formed was developed (Fig. 1). This device is \n\ninserted at the bottom of the evaporator tubes and it is then removed from the top. It thus \n\nscrapes the inner wall of the evaporation tube, allowing collection of the deposits (Fig. 1 \u2013 \n\nB). However, this device collects deposits throughout the tube, i.e. in a qualitative way. It is \n\ntherefore not possible to collect the deposit from a given section of the evaporation tube (e.g. \n\nonly the deposits formed at the bottom or at the top of the tube). As the product properties \n\nchange during passage through the tubes, the composition of the deposits must also change. \n\nStudy of the composition of the deposits formed in different sections of the evaporator tube \n\nis therefore necessary. This information will provide the responses to questions such as how \n\ndoes the nature of the product influence fouling formation, what is the nature of product \n\ncomponents deposited on the wall of the tube, and what is the best cleaning procedure to \n\nremove these deposits? \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n168 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. (A) Scraper device to collect deposits formed in the evaporation tubes and \n\n(B) Scraper device showing the deposits collected. \n\nVacuum evaporator cleaning procedures \n\nEvaporator cleaning procedures in the dairy industry are not standardized. Each \n\nindustry has its own way of conducting the evaporator cleaning process, i.e. process time \n\nbefore cleaning, circulation time, order and concentration of the cleaning agents, etc. In \n\nother words, there are as many evaporator cleaning procedures as products to be \n\nconcentrated. By optimizing the cleaning procedures, a reduction in energy costs and use \n\nof cleaning agents by 50% and 25%, respectively, can be achieved (Jeurnink and Brinkman, \n\n1994). The cleaning procedures of the falling film evaporator should be studied on the basis \n\nof measurement of product RTD in the vacuum evaporator and therefore the possibility of \n\ncalculation of the time that different solutions take to pass through the equipment. The aim \n\nof such study is to optimize the cleaning and rinsing times, and the concentration of chemical \n\ncleaning agents used (nitric acid and sodium hydroxide). Moreover, a choice of a tracer or \n\na solution property, such as conductivity, concentration, etc., should be established for \n\nA B \n\n\n\n \n\n169 \n\n \n\ncalculation of the RTD functions of the cleaning solutions. This should decrease the time, \n\nand therefore the cost, of rinsing and cleaning operations, which should also contribute to \n\ndecreasing the costs of the vacuum evaporation operation and improvement of the \n\nsustainability of the process. Another stage in the study of cleaning procedures is the \n\ndevelopment of different strategies for cleaning the evaporator, such as determination of the \n\nbest order of use of cleaning solutions (alkaline + acid or acid +alkaline) and their \n\nconcentrations. The previous study of the nature of the deposits should therefore be useful \n\nto improve cleaning procedures. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n170 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAdib, T.A., 2008.
