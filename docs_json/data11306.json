M. Simulation of water and nitrogen dynamics in a Cerrado soil under coffee \n\ncultivation using SWAP and ANIMO models. 2015. 123 p. Tese (Doutorado) \u2013 Centro de \n\nEnergia Nuclear na Agricultura, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Piracicaba, 2015. \n\n \n\nAgriculture when only focused on production leads to an unsustainable use of inputs with \n\nnegative consequences to the environment and human health. One consequence of the \n\nexcessive use of fertilizers is the pollution of surface and underground water resources in \n\nagricultural eco-systems and their boundaries. The Brazilian Cerrado has been suffering the \n\ntransformations of the intensive agriculture during the last decades. Due to the poor fertility of \n\nsoils, in general very sandy and of low pH, the use of agricultural inputs is intensified and the \n\nnutrient downward transport by leaching becomes a serious problem in different regions. \n\nInformation about the current use practices of fertilizer use in the Cerrado environment must \n\nbe gathered for a healthy transition of this biome. Models based on physical and chemical \n\nprocesses are useful tools to simulate water and nutrient dynamics in agricultural systems, \n\nincluding the related losses due to adopted managements. They have the potential to evaluate \n\ndifferent scenarios to predict outcomings of such practices.  Among the available models for \n\nsuch processes, SWAP (Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant model) has been used under \n\nseveral agronomic conditions to describe hydrologic processes, and ANIMO (Nitrogen in \n\nAgriculture model) to simulate N cycling in agricultural systems. Our study presents an \n\napplication of SWAP to adult perennial coffee crops along one productive cycle, with focus \n\non deep drainage losses and irrigation management in a representative Brazilian Cerrado \n\nmanagement system. The SWAP/ANIMO combination was used in this study to simulate N \n\nabsorption by coffee plants and N leaching in the form NO3-N, as a result of an intensive \n\nfertilizer management practice. The ANIMO program was calibrated in relation to one N \n\ntreatment, of 400 kg ha\n-1\n\n year\n-1\n\n, and was evaluated with independent data of NO3-N in soil \n\nsolution of another treatment of 800 kg ha\n-1\n\n year\n-1\n\n. The yearly water balance (WB) obtained \n\nfrom SWAP was similar to that obtained through a sequential climatologic WB of \n\nThornthwaite and Matter. However, the monthly deep drainage values obtained by SWAP as \n\ncompared to the WB values presented differences with a determination coefficient of 0.77 in a \n\nlinearization of the results. Irrigation scenarios with intervals of 3(IF3), 5(IF5), 10 (IF10) e 15 \n\n(IF15) days between water applications were simulated by SWAP and compared with the \n\nirrigation management practiced in the farm where the experiment was carried out. These \n\nsimulations showed for longer intervals (IF15) drainage losses were smaller, water \n\nproductivity higher, as well as relative productivity.  Measurements of N absorption by plants \n\nobtained experimentally were similar to ANIMO simulations. Sensitivity analyses of the \n\nmodel showed that leaching and soil solution concentration of NO3-N are sensitive to soil pH \n\nand temperature of the decomposition processes. We conclude that the combination of SWAP \n\nwith ANIMO was efficient for the description of the N cycle in a Cerrado soil-plant-\n\natmosphere system. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Water balance.

Simula\u00e7\u00e3o da din\u00e2mica da \u00e1gua e do nitrog\u00eanio em um solo de Cerrado \n\ncultivado com caf\u00e9 utilizando os modelos SWAP e ANIMO. 2015. 123 p. Tese \n\n(Doutorado) \u2013 Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, \n\nPiracicaba, 2015. \n\n \n\nA agricultura focada apenas na produ\u00e7\u00e3o leva ao uso insustent\u00e1vel de recursos resultando em \n\nconsequ\u00eancias negativas para o meio ambiente e a sa\u00fade humana. Uma consequ\u00eancia do uso \n\nexcessivo de fertilizantes \u00e9 a contamina\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos h\u00eddricos subterr\u00e2neos e superficiais \n\nem ecossistemas agr\u00edcolas e nos seus arredores. Devido o solo da regi\u00e3o do Cerrado ser pobre \n\nem nutrientes, predominantemente arenoso e com alta acidez, o uso de insumos agr\u00edcolas \u00e9 \n\nintensificado e o transporte qu\u00edmico de nutrientes via lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um problema para a \n\nagricultura intensiva nas diferentes regi\u00f5es. Informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre as atuais pr\u00e1ticas de uso de \n\nfertilizantes e seus efeitos no ambiente de Cerrado precisam ser coletadas para reduzir os \n\nimpactos da agricultura nesse ecossistema. Modelos baseados em processos f\u00edsicos e qu\u00edmicos \n\ns\u00e3o ferramentas \u00fateis para simular a din\u00e2mica da \u00e1gua e nutrientes no meio agr\u00edcola e as \n\nperdas associadas aos manejos adotados, com potencial para avaliar diferentes cen\u00e1rios de \n\nprevis\u00e3o dos resultados dessas pr\u00e1ticas. Entre os modelos baseados em processos, o SWAP \n\n(modelo Solo, \u00c1gua, Atmosfera e Planta) tem sido utilizado com sucesso em v\u00e1rias condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nagron\u00f4micas para descrever processos h\u00eddricos, e o ANIMO (modelo de nitrog\u00eanio na \n\nagricultura) para simular o ciclo do nitrog\u00eanio em sistemas agr\u00edcolas. Nosso estudo apresenta \n\numa aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do SWAP para culturas de caf\u00e9 perenes maduras ao longo de um ciclo \n\nprodutivo, com foco nas perdas por drenagem e no manejo da irriga\u00e7\u00e3o em um sistema t\u00edpico \n\ndo Cerrado Brasileiro. A combina\u00e7\u00e3o dos modelos SWAP/ANIMO foi utilizada nesse estudo \n\npara simular a absor\u00e7\u00e3o de N pelas plantas de caf\u00e9 e a lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o do nitrog\u00eanio na forma de \n\nnitrato (NO3-N) resultante de uma pr\u00e1tica de manejo de fertilizantes intensiva. O ANIMO foi \n\ncalibrado para o cen\u00e1rio correspondente \u00e0 aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de 400 kg ha\n-1\n\n ano\n-1 \n\nde fertilizante \n\nmineral, e foi avaliado com dados independentes de NO3-N na solu\u00e7\u00e3o do solo medidos em \n\nparcelas de outro tratamento que receberam 800 kg ha\n-1\n\n ano\n-1\n\n. O balan\u00e7o h\u00eddrico anual obtido \n\npelo SWAP foi semelhante ao obtido pelo balan\u00e7o sequencial climatol\u00f3gico, de Thornthwaite \n\ne Matter. No entanto, os valores mensais de drenagem profunda obtidos pelo SWAP e \n\ncomparados com os resultados do balan\u00e7o climatol\u00f3gico apresentaram diferen\u00e7as, com um \n\ncoeficiente de determina\u00e7\u00e3o de 0,77 na lineariza\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados. Cen\u00e1rios de irriga\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\nintervalos de 3 (IF3), 5 (IF5), 10 (IF10) e 15 (IF15) dias entre aplica\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1gua  foram \n\nsimulados utilizando o SWAP e comparados com a pr\u00e1tica de manejo da fazenda onde o \n\nestudo experimental foi realizado. As simula\u00e7\u00f5es dos cen\u00e1rios com o SWAP mostraram que \n\nas irriga\u00e7\u00f5es com intervalos mais longos (IF15) apresentam menores quantidades de perdas \n\npor drenagem, maior produtividade da \u00e1gua e produtividade relativa da cultura. As medidas \n\nde absor\u00e7\u00e3o de N pelas plantas obtidas experimentalmente foram similares \u00e0s estimativas do \n\nmodelo ANIMO. As analises de sensibilidade do modelo mostraram que as previs\u00f5es da \n\nlixivia\u00e7\u00e3o e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de NO3-N na solu\u00e7\u00e3o do solo s\u00e3o sens\u00edveis \u00e0s vari\u00e1veis pH do solo \n\ne temperatura de refer\u00eancia dos processos de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Conclui-se que a combina\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nmodelos unidimensionais baseados em processos SWAP/ANIMO foi eficaz na descri\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nciclo do N avaliado no sistema solo-planta do Cerrado. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Balan\u00e7o h\u00eddrico.

Introduction \n\n \n\nThe demand for food production has increased and agriculture frontiers advanced in \n\nthe Brazilian territory.  During the last decades, the Brazilian savannah (Cerrado) was \n\nexplored by agriculture under specific management practices, established in parts by scientific \n\nand technological advances (LOPES; GUILHERME; RAMOS, 2012), which allowed the \n\ncrop cultivation in areas which were thought to be improper due to soil and weather \n\nconditions. \n\nRada (2013) concluded that Brazil can significantly improve its position as a supplier \n\nof commodities if the Cerrado agriculture increases its efficiency and farmers start using \n\nadvanced technology and management practices in the technical frontier. \n\nFor coffee cultivation in the Cerrado, several actions have been made by institutions \n\nlike Embrapa, which is responsible for new technologies of rational water use as, for example, \n\nthe controlled water stress used for cultivation management and the Wastewater Cleaning \n\nSystem used for coffee fruit processing (COSTA; BESSA; FERREIRA, 2014). Bruno et al. \n\n(2011) and Neto et al. (2011) looked for the best application moment and dose of nitrogen for \n\na coffee cultivation in a Cerrado area and their studies are examples for an efficient use of \n\nresources in agriculture. \n\nWater and fertilizer efficient use are relevant themes for coffee cultivation in the \n\nCerrado and more scientific studies are needed with the aim to promote an efficient \n\ncultivation in this region. Significant information regarding water dynamics and nitrogen \n\nlosses due to management practices are important for achieving these objectives. \n\nThe recent advance in computational technology contributed for the construction of \n\nmodels that became an advantage as a tool in scientific studies. Today models can be used for \n\nidentification of gaps in scientific knowledge, for generating and evaluating hypotheses, for \n\nplanning experimental research, and, moreover, can be used to establish most influent \n\nparameters that control systems (MATHEUS; STEPHENS, 2002). Simulation models are also \n\nable to evaluate future scenarios, to predict specific situations and the outcomes of a system \n\ndue to actions. The commented characteristics of modeling are desirable for studies in \n\nagriculture, which are full of risks and influences of weather, management, pests and diseases.  \n\nModels in their majority can be classified as empiric or process-based, or they can \n\ntend to be more of one or other (or both) classifications.  Process-based models simulate in \n\ndetail the physical and biologic processes that describe the behavior of studied systems. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nEmpiric models are simpler and are based on relations of correlation, without describing the \n\nsystem completely (ADMS et al., 2013). The process-based models although more \n\ncomprehensive in processes description, generally require more input data and information. \n\nHowever, process-based models are more susceptible to be applied for different study \n\nconditions, since they are composed by general formulations, common in all terrestrial \n\nsystems, and can be adjusted to specific situations. \n\nThe hypothesis to be investigated in this study is that a combination of one-\n\ndimensional process-based models is effective to simulate the dynamics of water and nitrogen \n\nin a highly fertirrigated coffee farming system in the Cerrado. \n\nThe specific objectives are: \n\n1. Adjust SWAP and ANIMO models to a fertirrigated coffee cultivation system of the \n\nCerrado and simulate the dynamics of water and nitrogen. \n\n2. Calibrate SWAP and ANIMO models and evaluate the sensitivity of the simulated \n\nprocesses to the input parameters and variables. \n\n3.

Nos \u00faltimos anos o ecossistema Cerrado tem \n\nsido explorado pela agricultura sob manejos espec\u00edficos, estabelecidos em partes pelo avan\u00e7o \n\ncient\u00edfico e tecnol\u00f3gico (LOPES; GUILHERME; RAMOS, 2012), que permitiram o cultivo \n\nagr\u00edcola em \u00e1reas antes caracterizadas como impr\u00f3prias devido \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es de solo e clima. \n\nRada (2013) sugere que o Brazil pode aumentar significativamente a sua posi\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\ncompeti\u00e7\u00e3o global pelo fornecimento de \u201ccommodities\u201d agr\u00edcolas aumentando a efici\u00eancia da \n\nagricultura no Cerrado se houver melhorias nas t\u00e9cnicas de manejo e aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ntecnologia empregada por agricultores \u00e0quela da fronteira tecnol\u00f3gica.  \n\nPara o cultivo do caf\u00e9 no Cerrado, muitos esfor\u00e7os t\u00eam sido feitos por institui\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncomo a Embrapa no Cerrado central, a qual \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel por novas tecnologias de uso \n\nracional da \u00e1gua, podendo-se citar, por exemplo, o estresse h\u00eddrico controlado como manejo \n\nde cultivo e o sistema de limpeza de \u00c1guas Residu\u00e1rias usado no processamento dos frutos de \n\ncaf\u00e9 (COSTA; BESSA; FERREIRA, 2014). Bruno et al. (2011) e Neto et al. (2011) buscaram \n\no melhor momento de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o e dose de nitrog\u00eanio para o caf\u00e9 do Cerrado, e s\u00e3o exemplos \n\nde medidas para um manejo eficiente de recursos na agricultura. \n\nO uso eficiente da \u00e1gua e de fertilizantes s\u00e3o temas relevantes para o desenvolvimento \n\nda cafeicultura no Cerrado. No entanto, s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios mais estudos com prop\u00f3sitos de \n\npromover a sustentabilidade desse cultivo no Cerrado. Informa\u00e7\u00f5es significativas a respeito \n\nda din\u00e2mica da \u00e1gua nesses sistemas e de processos de perdas de nitrog\u00eanio ligados ao manejo \n\nde fertilizantes s\u00e3o temas importantes para alcan\u00e7ar estes objetivos. \n\nO avan\u00e7o da tecnologia computacional contribuiu para que os modelos \n\ncomputacionais se tornassem uma ferramenta de suporte vantajosa em estudos cient\u00edficos. \n\nHoje os modelos podem ser usados na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de colunas no conhecimento cient\u00edfico, \n\npara gerar e testar hip\u00f3teses, com o objetivo de projetar experimentos e, al\u00e9m disso, podem \n\nser usados na determina\u00e7\u00e3o dos par\u00e2metros mais influentes de um sistema (MATHEUS; \n\nSTEPHENS, 2002). Modelos de simula\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m ferramentas capazes de gerar cen\u00e1rios \n\npara o futuro, prever situa\u00e7\u00f5es e respostas de um sistema a uma a\u00e7\u00e3o. Essas caracter\u00edsticas da \n\nmodelagem s\u00e3o importantes especialmente para a agricultura, a qual \u00e9 permeada por riscos e \n\ninflu\u00eancias do clima, do manejo agr\u00edcola, de pestes e doen\u00e7as. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nOs modelos podem ser classificados como emp\u00edricos ou baseado em processos, ou \n\ntender mais para uma das duas classifica\u00e7\u00f5es. Os modelos baseados em processos simulam \n\ncom detalhe os processos f\u00edsicos e biol\u00f3gicos que descrevem o comportamento de um \n\nsistema. Os modelos emp\u00edricos s\u00e3o mais simples e baseiam-se em rela\u00e7\u00f5es de correla\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\nsem descrever um sistema completamente (ADMS et al., 2013). Os modelos baseados em \n\nprocessos apesar de mais compreensivos na descri\u00e7\u00e3o dos processos, requerem maior n\u00famero \n\nde dados de entrada e informa\u00e7\u00f5es. No entanto, os modelos baseados em processos s\u00e3o mais \n\nsuscept\u00edveis a serem aplicados em diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es, pois s\u00e3o compostos por formula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ngerais, comuns nos sistemas terrestres e aceitam a incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de dados locais, podendo ser \n\nadequados a situa\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas.  \n\nA hip\u00f3tese desse estudo \u00e9 que uma associa\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos unidimensionais baseados \n\nem processos f\u00edsicos \u00e9 eficaz para simular a din\u00e2mica da \u00e1gua e do nitrog\u00eanio em um sistema \n\nde cultivo de caf\u00e9 do oeste da Bahia. \n\nCom o prop\u00f3sito de avaliar esta hip\u00f3tese, este estudo tem os seguintes objetivos: \n\n1.

Among the existing computational models to describe hydrological processes, \n\nSWAP (Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant model) has been successfully used under several \n\nconditions. This model was originally developed to simulate short cycle crops and its use also \n\nto cover longer cycles, e.g. perennial crops, is a new application. This report shows a SWAP \n\napplication to a mature coffee crop over one-production cycle, focusing on deep drainage \n\nlosses in a typical soil-plant-atmosphere system of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). The \n\nestimated annual deep drainage Q = 1019 mm obtained by SWAP was within 99% of the \n\nvalue determined by the climatologic water balance of 1010 mm. Monthly results of SWAP \n\nfor Q compared to the estimative using the climatological method presented a determination \n\ncoefficient of 0.77. A variety of coffee fertigation scenarios was simulated using SWAP and \n\ncompared to farmer\u2019s management scenario, leading to the conclusion that larger irrigation \n\nintervals result in lower Q losses, better water productivity and higher crop yield. ?\n\n \n\nKeywords: Brazil, SWAP, deep drainage, water productivity, Cerrado \n\n  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe savanna ecoregion (Cerrado) prevails in central Brazil, also reaching the northeast \n\npart of the country and including part of the state of Bahia. The Cerrado domain in Bahia is \n\nhighly suitable for irrigated agriculture due to the great availability of surface and \n\nunderground water resources. According to Brazil's National Grain Supply Company \n\n(CONAB), western Bahia is an important food (grain) provider and holds, for example, the \n\nhighest coffee yield under Cerrado conditions in the country. However, there are some \n\nconcerns in respect to the modern agriculture practiced in this producer region. Due to the \n\nineffective land management during the last decades, the irrigated farms concentrated at \n\nspecific areas and, therefore, conflicts over water use already took place in western Bahia \n\n(LIMA, 2011).  At the same time, management practices applied by farmers are not \n\nsustainable in terms of fertilizer and water usage, especially due to the lack of scientific \n\nstudies that support their decisions (BRUNO et al., 2011).   \n\nNumerical modeling applied to agriculture is a useful tool to simulate biophysical \n\nprocesses and can be used to obtain short-term results and future predictions under defined \n\nscenarios. The information generated is helpful for establishing a more sustainable agriculture \n\nas well as supporting strategies for the mitigation of pollution, named by Strauch et al. (2013) \n\nas the \u201cBest Management Practices\u201d. The hydrological model SWAP (Soil, Water, \n\nAtmosphere and Plant) is one of the existing algorithms used worldwide for a variety of soils, \n\ncrops and climatic conditions (CHIRICO et al., 2013; CRESCIMANNO; MORGA; \n\nVENTRELL, 2012; EITZINGER et al., 2004; KAMBLE et al., 2013; MA et al., 2011; \n\nNOORY et al., 2011). The model has shown consistent results when applied to maize crops in \n\nsub-tropical climates (PINHEIRO et al., 2013) and to soybeans and common beans in tropical \n\nclimates (SCORZA JUNIOR; SILVA; RIGITANO, 2010; DURIGON et al., 2012). SWAP \n\nwas successfully validated already under several climatic and environmental conditions as \n\ncited Ines et al. (2006).  More recent studies with this model found close agreement between \n\nmeasured and simulated values (MISHRA et al., 2013; SINGH; REN; KANG, 2010; UTSET \n\net al., 2007; VAZIFEDOUST et al., 2008; VERMA; GUPTA; ISAAC, 2012). \n\nThis study aimed to use SWAP to evaluate the deep drainage of a Cerrado coffee \n\nplantation and analyze irrigation scenarios in view of water productivity and conservation, \n\nminimizing environmental impacts. Values of SWAP input parameters were acquired from a \n\none-year experimental database coming from a study performed on a mature coffee crop \n\ngrowing in central Brazil (BORTOLOTTO et al., 2011; 2012; BRUNO et al., 2011).  \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nThe computer simulations focused on improving water usage and understanding of water \n\ndynamics in a sandy soil typical of the Brazilian Cerrado, an area intensively used to grow \n\nperennial crops. We studied several scenarios of irrigation to improve water productivity for \n\nthe chosen area. \n\n \n\n2.2 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n2.1.1 The Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant model (SWAP) \n\n \n\nThe model SWAP was developed more than 40 years ago and was gradually upgraded \n\nreaching its last version SWAP 3.2 (KROES et al., 2008). This last version of the model had \n\nthe source code restructured, numerical stability improved, macropore process integrated, and \n\nsimplification of precipitation and evapotranspiration inputs included (VAN DAM et al., \n\n2008). \n\nSWAP makes use of Richards' equation in one dimension added by the sink terms (S) \n\nto calculate the water movement in the soil matrix, as follows: \n\n? ?\nK( ) 1\n\nh\nh\n\nhz\nS h\n\nt z\n\n?\n\n? ??? ?\n? ?? ?? ?\n\n? ? ?? ?\n? ?\n\n? ?     \n (2.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ? (cm\n3\n cm\n\n-3\n) is the volumetric soil water content, t (d) time, S (cm\n\n3\n cm\n\n-3\n d\n\n-1\n) the soil \n\nextraction rate by plant roots, K (cm d\n-1\n\n) the soil hydraulic conductivity, h (cm) the soil water \n\npressure head and z (cm) the vertical coordinate taken positively upwards. SWAP uses \n\nRichards' equation for describing water flux in the unsaturated and saturated zones of the soil \n\nand solves the equation (2.1) numerically, using the relations between ?, h and K, with the \n\nMualem-van Genuchten relations ?(h) and K(h)  (MUALEM, 1976; VAN GENUCHTEN, \n\n1980). \n\n The upper boundary conditions in SWAP are determined according to the rates of \n\npotential evapotranspiration ETp (mm), irrigation I (mm) and precipitation P (mm) of the area \n\nunder study. Daily ETp is calculated with the Penman-Monteith equation (MONTEITH, 1965; \n\n1981) using meteorological data of air temperature Tair (\u00baC), solar radiation RAD (kJ m\n-2\n\n), \n\nwind speed Sw (m s\n-1\n\n) and air humidity Ha (kPa). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nThe water balance is determined as in equation (2.2): \n\n \n\ns a i\nW P I ET RO P Q?? ? ? ? ? ? ?    (2.2) \n\n \n\nwhere Ws (mm) is the soil water storage in a defined elemental soil volume, ETa (mm) the \n\nactual evapotranspiration, RO (mm) the run-off and run-on, Pi (mm) the canopy water \n\ninterception and Q (mm) the soil water drained at the lower boundary, equal to -Qd or +Qcr. \n\nThe percolation Qd is downwards and Qcr the upwards, when the capillary rise is present. Qd \n\ncan still be subdivided into the components QdI, due to irrigation, and QdP, due to the rainfall.  \n\nActual evapotranspiration is calculated considering the reduction of root water uptake when \n\nthere is water or salinity stress, and the reduction of soil water content due to the soil surface \n\ndrying.  The actual transpiration Ta (mm) is obtained as follows: \n\n0\n\n( ) z\n\nd\n\na\n\nR\n\nT S z d\n?\n\n? ?      (2.3) \n\n \n\nwhere the lower integration limit Rd is rooting depth and S the root water flux, which is \n\nrelated to the potential transpiration Tp (mm). During water stress, S(z) is described in SWAP \n\nas proposed by Feddes, Kowalik and Zaradny (1978). In this function, the root water uptake is \n\nregulated by the critical pressure head values h1 (point where water extraction ceases due to \n\nanoxia), h2 (begin of constant maximum root extraction), h3 (end of constant maximum root \n\nextraction), h4 (wilting point, where root extraction ends). The actual evaporation is \n\ndetermined by Darcy\u2019s relation and empirically either according to Black, Gardner and \n\nThurtell (1969) or to Boesten and Stroosnijder (1986), to be selected by the SWAP user. The \n\nbottom boundary condition is adjusted by the user and can be, for example, prescribed with \n\npressure head values of the bottom soil compartment, calculated as a function of the \n\ngroundwater level, or the boundary condition can be the free drainage of the soil profile. \n\nSWAP contains simple and detailed crop growth modules, which should be selected \n\nby the user according to the available plant data. In the simple model the user provides the \n\nleaf area index (LAI), crop factor (Kc) and rooting depth as a function of the crop development \n\nstage (DS). These data are used to calculate the canopy interception Pi, potential transpiration \n\nTp and potential evaporation Ep. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Experimental site and field experiment \n\n \n\nAn experimental test used to calibrate and compare the results of the SWAP model \n\nwas performed between August 1\nst\n, 2008 and July 31\n\nst\n, 2009, at a private farm near the city of \n\nBarreiras (11\u00b046\u201900\u2019\u2019 S, 45\u00b043\u201932\u2019\u2019 W), in Bahia, northeast Brazil (Figure 2.1). The soil is \n\nclassified as a Typic Hapludox according to the USDA Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, \n\n2010), with low natural fertility and is located in a Cerrado region. The precipitation is very \n\nvariable, ranging from 800 to 1800 mm per year, with most events occurring from October to \n\nApril. Meteorological data, acquired from the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET, \n\nBrazil), were collected at the meteorological station of the municipality of Barreiras, 90 km \n\nfar from the experimental site. The input variables farmer irrigation depths and precipitation \n\nalong the experimental year used for SWAP simulations are shown in Figure 2.2. Irrigation is \n\nnot discontinued during the rainy season due to the fertilizer application carried out year \n\nround. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Experimental site localization, showing central pivot circles in 2013 \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 - Daily precipitation (a) and irrigation (b) during the experimental year (August 2008 to \n\nJuly 2009) \n \n\nThe coffee species was Coffea Arabica L., variety Catua\u00ed Vermelho. Plants were seven \n\nyears old at the beginning of the experiment and were planted at a spacing of 3.8 m between \n\nlines and 0.5 m between plants in a circular arrangement for central pivot irrigation with a \n\ntotal area of 80 ha, adapted for fertigation. Irrigation was applied homogeneously over the \n\nplanted area, and the experimental site consisted of the pivot circle number 4, starting from \n\nthe center of the coffee plantation (BRUNO et al., 2011). Irrigation was performed by LEPA-\n\ntype emitters, which distribute the water according to the circular coffee lines, avoiding the \n\napplication of water in the interrow. The pivot operation was continuous during the year and \n\nstopped only during harvest (May-June), according to farmer\u00b4s practice.  \n\nFor the saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks (cm d\n-1\n\n), soil bulk density ?s (g cm\n-3\n\n) and \n\nsoil particle size analyzes, soil samples were extracted from soil layers 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, \n\n40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm (Table 2.1) in the coffee field. In the laboratory, the constant \n\nhead method (REYNOLDS et al., 2002) was employed for obtaining Ks. Soil water retention \n\ncurves were constructed using sieved soil samples (2 mm sieve), assuming for sandy soils the \n\nstructure of the samples is of little importance. Samples of each soil layer were submitted to \n\nthe pressures of 100, 200, 330, 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, 10000, 15000 cm of water in the \n\nlaboratory, using the Richards pressure plate extractors. A soil water retention curve was \n\nestablished by fitting the van Genuchten (VG) model to all water retention data (R\u00b2 = 0.88) \n\nfor the 1 m soil profile, using the RETC program (VAN GENUCHTEN; LEIJ; YATES, \n\n1991).  \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n\nThe saturated and residual water contents (?s and ?r, cm\n3\n cm\n\n-3\n), the shape parameters n and  \n\n? (cm\n-1\n\n) needed for SWAP simulations were obtained together with their 5% upper and lower \n\nlimits (Table 2.2). The upper limits of VG parameters were represented by ?s\n+\n, ?r\n\n+\n, n\n\n+\n and  \n\n?\n+\n, and the lower limits by ?s\n\n-\n, ?r\n\n-\n, n\n\n-\n and ?\n\n-\n. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Physical characteristics of the experimental site soil as a function of depth \n\nSoil \n\ndepth \n\n(cm) \n\nNumber of \n\nsamples for \n\nKs test \n\nKs (cm d\n-1\n\n) \nS.D. \n\n(cm d\n-1\n\n). \n\n?s  \n\n(g cm\n-3\n\n) \n\nSand\na\n \n\n(%) \n\nClay\na\n \n\n(%) \n\nSilt\na\n \n\n(%) \n\n0-10 15 184 130 1.79\n \n\n78 16 6 \n\n10-20 6 349 106 1.79 78 19 3 \n\n20-40 4 354 51 1.57 73 22 4 \n\n40-60 3 454 155 1.53 71 23 6 \n\n60-80 3 268 135 1.52 70 24 6 \n\n80-100 3 267 15 1.50 69 25 6 \nNote: Ks, saturated hydraulic conductivity; S.D., standard deviation of Ks; ?s, bulk density. \na\nTexture values are from three replicates.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 \u2013 Parameters of van Genuchten obtained for the 1m soil profile \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nNote:  Upper and lower values for van Genuchten parameters represent upper and lower \n\nlimits in the interval of 95% of confidence.

(2012). In their study, \n\nthe Climatologic Water Balances (CWB) were calculated for the pivot area with time intervals \n\nof 5 days, during the entire one-year coffee producing cycle, using a sequential method \n\nproposed by Rolim, Sentelhas and Barbieri (1998). Due to the characteristics of the \n\nplantation, flat and well drained with a deep water table located several meters below the soil \n\nsurface, the RO was considered to be zero, as well as Qcr. Bortolotto et al. (2012) estimated \n\nETp by the Thornthwaite (1948) and Penman-Monteith (1965) models. They considered the \n\ncoffee crop factor (Kc) as equal to 1.0, based on studies that showed values in the range of 0.6 \n\nvan Genuchten \n\nparameters \n5% lower Mean 5% upper \n\n?s (cm\u00b3cm\n-3\n\n) 0.367 0.387 0.407 \n\n?r (cm\u00b3cm\n-3\n\n) 0.076 0.097 0.117 \n\nn 1.379 1.636 1.893 \n\n?

The sequential \n\nCWB in Bortolotto et al. (2012) assumes Pi = 0 and calculates a component called water \n\nexcess (EXC), which includes RO and Q. As RO and Qcr are considered zero, EXC = Q = Qd \n\nis assumed, and Q is only the downward drainage which is lost from the crop below the 1 m \n\ndepth.\n \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Parameter estimation \n\n \n\nInformation about soil hydrology, plant, and meteorological data are the SWAP input \n\nrequirements to run it. The model works with a collection of input files: main file, crop file, \n\nirrigation file and meteorological files for each year of the simulation. The irrigation file \n\nrequires dates and amounts of water applied by irrigation and the meteorological file requires \n\ndaily variables: air temperature Tair (\u00baC), solar radiation RAD (kJ m\n-2\n\n), wind speed Sw (m s\n-1\n\n), \n\nair vapor pressure Ha (kPa), and P (mm).  \n\nThe water balance components were simulated for each month during the one-year \n\nperiod of study. The moment of crop emergence was set on August 1\nst\n, 2008 and the crop \n\nharvest was on July 31\nst\n, 2009, the period of the coffee cycle (BRUNO et al., 2011). The \n\namount of water applied by irrigation was scheduled as shown in Figure 2.2. \n\nThe initial pressure head distribution in the soil was unknown and necessary for the \n\nwater balance simulation, so the pressure head distribution in the soil profile at the end of one \n\nyear of the first simulation with SWAP was used thereafter as the initial condition. The soil \n\nprofile (0-1 m) was divided into three sub-layers with thicknesses of 10, 40 and 50 cm, each \n\nsub-layer containing 10, 8 and 5 layers with 1, 5 and 10 cm width, respectively. This \n\npossibility of soil profile discrimination in SWAP allows us to analyze in details the evolution \n\nof predicted ? and h in the time frame. The bottom-boundary condition of free drainage of the \n\nsoil profile was selected in SWAP because the water table is located several meters below the \n\nsoil surface. In this case, the bottom flux of the SWAP soil profile is equal to the hydraulic \n\nconductivity in the last soil compartment, as the gradient of water potential in soils under \n\ndrainage can be assumed to be unity (KROES et al., 2008). \n\nThe empirical parameter of pore connectivity ?, proposed by Mualem (1976), is \n\ndifficult to be evaluated directly.  According to data compiled by De Jong van Lier, Dourado-\n\nNeto and Metselaar (2009), values of ? commonly vary between 6 and -6, whereas values of \n\n0.5 or 0 are more often used.  Therefore, several values of ? were used in the sensitivity \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n\nanalysis to show the influence of this parameter in our simulations. An average Ks-value \n\n(from Table 2.1) representative of the 1 m soil layer was used in the simulations. \n\nThe SWAP simple crop module requires information of the leaf area index, crop \n\nfactor, maximum rooting depth as a function of the development stage, as well as the light \n\nextinction coefficient and the critical pressure head values of the Feddes distribution \n\n(FEDDES; KOWALIK; ZARADNY, 1978). The model is recommended for annual crops \n\nwith short growing cycles, up to one-year maximum. Nonetheless, a small number of studies \n\napplied SWAP to perennial plants, including wine grapes  (BEN-ASHER et al., 2006; \n\nRALLO et al., 2012) and citrus (MART\u00cdNEZ-FERRI; MURIEL-F\u00c9RNANDEZ; \n\nRODR\u00cdGUEZ D\u00cdAZ, 2013). Because not all the data needed about the coffee plant was \n\navailable in the database of Bruno et al. (2011) and Bortolotto et al. (2012), the simple crop \n\nmodule was our choice to represent the coffee plantation.  \n\nCoffee leaf area index (LAI) was estimated from leaf dry matter (available in BRUNO \n\net al., 2011), the measured specific leaf area, SLA (18 m\u00b2 kg\n-1\n\n), per plant soil cover,  \n\nSCA (1.9 m\u00b2). A variety of coffee leaf sizes was collected from the same experimental plants \n\nin 2013 to determine the average SLA. The obtained values of LAI for different stages  \n\n(LAI0, LAI50%, LAI75% and LAI100%) along the experimental cycle are shown in Table 2.3.  \n\nFor the characterization of the coffee crop in SWAP, we assumed a constant crop \n\ncoefficient Kc for the entire year, equal to 1.1 (ALLEN et al., 1998). The coffee rooting depth \n\nRd, as measured by Bortolotto et al. (2012) and Bruno et al. (2011) reaches the maximum \n\ndepth of 1 m and was considered constant during the experimental year. Additional \n\ninformation about the root density (Ry) distribution along the soil profile was obtained for the \n\ncrop based on visual observations of Bruno et al. (2011). Four times during the experimental \n\nyear they collected an entire plant and measured the dry matter of leaves, branches, and roots, \n\nas well as root depth and distribution in the soil profile. According to these authors, the \n\nrelative root density is abundant from the surface down to the 0.6 m depth, decreasing linearly \n\nfrom there until zero at 1 m. \n\nThe coefficient kgr is the product of the extinction diffuse light coefficient for visible \n\nlight (kdif) and the extinction coefficient for direct visible light (kdir). The parameter kgr was \n\nanalyzed using values between 0.2 and 2.2 (KROES et al., 2008) in the analysis of sensitivity. \n\nMeasurements of the extinction coefficient of coffee are rare in the literature. Field \n\nmeasurements with a five-year-old coffee plantation of the S\u00e3o Paulo region showed an \n\nextinction coefficient of 0.53 for an average LAI equal to 3.8 (ANGELOCCI et al., 2008).  \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nThe interception coefficient of Von Hoyningen-Hune and Braden (ic) was selected for the \n\npresent study from Kroes et al. (2008), for ordinary crops. \n\nThe information regarding the limiting pressure head for soil water extraction by plant \n\nroots is described in the SWAP crop file. Between h1 and h2 water extraction by roots is \n\nassumed to increase linearly towards low values of h. The optimal root water uptake occurs \n\nbetween h2 and h3h (at high potential transpiration) or h3l (at low potential transpiration). The \n\nwilting point was selected to be h4 = -15000 cm. The values h3 are those recommended for \n\ndeciduous fruit plants shown in Taylor and Ashcroft (1972), which is the kind of plant that \n\nbetter adjusts to the characteristics of the coffee crops. The parameter values established in the \n\nsoil and crop files for SWAP simulations in this study (Table 2.3) were called standard \n\nvalues.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.3 \u2013 Standard values used in SWAP simulations \n\nDescription \nParameter \n\nsymbol \nValue Unit \n\nSoil    \n\nSaturated volumetric water content ?s 0.3874 cm\n3\n cm\n\n-3\n \n\nResidual volumetric water content  ?r 0.0969 cm\n3\n cm\n\n-3\n \n\nShape parameter of the retention curve n 1.636 -\na\n \n\nShape parameter of the retention curve ? 0.017 cm\n-1\n\n \n\nShape parameter of hydraulic conductivity curve ? 0.5 - \n\nSaturated hydraulic conductivity Ks 266 cm d\n-1\n\n \n\nPlant \n   \n\nLight extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light Kdif 0.9 - \n\nLight extinction coefficient for direct visible light Kdir 0.86 - \n\nLeaf area index at the beginning of simulation  LAI0 8.8 ha ha\n-1\n\n \n\nLeaf area index for 50% of the simulation period LAI50% 10.3 ha ha\n-1\n\n \n\nLeaf area index for 75% of the simulation period LAI75% 12.0 ha ha\n-1\n\n \n\nLeaf area index at the final of simulation LAI100% 7.7 ha ha\n-1\n\n \n\nCrop coefficient Kc 1.1 - \n\nInterception coefficient of Von Hoyningen-Hune and Braden ic 0.025 - \n\nRooting depth during the experimental period Rd 1.00 m \n\nRelative root density in soil surface at RRd = 0 Ry0 1.00 - \n\nRelative root density at RRd = 0.6 Ry0.6 1.00 - \n\nRelative root density at RRd = 1.0 Ry1.0 0 - \n\n h1 -1 cm \n\n h2 -25 cm \n\nCritical pressure heads for root extraction h3h -500 cm \n\n h3l -800 cm \n\n h4 -15000 cm \nNote: RRd, relative root depth. \na\n \u201c-\u201c refers to non-dimensional parameters. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n2.2.5 Model evaluation \n\n \n\nIn the analysis of sensitivity regarding the standard values of the parameters presented \n\nin Table 2.3, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (SMITH et al., 1997) was used and \n\ncalculated using Equation (2.4). SWAP Qi simulations obtained with those standard values \n\nwere compared with SWAP Qi\u2019 simulations obtained when varying one of them and \n\nmaintaining all other constant. The lower the value of RMSE, the smaller the sensitivity of the \n\nmodel to the varied parameter.  \n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n( ' )\n\nk\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nRMSE Q Q\nk ?\n\n? ??\n    \n\n(2.4) \n\nSWAP simulations were also compared to Bortolotto\u2019s CWBs, using equation (2.4), as \n\nfollows: \n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n( )\n\nk\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nRMSE F B\nk ?\n\n? ??\n \n\n   (2.4a) \n\n \n\nwhere Bi are monthly values of Q or ETa from Bortolotto et al. (2012), iF  \nthe corresponding \n\nSWAP forecasted values, and k the number of observations. In this case, the lower the value \n\nof RMSE, the closer the proximity of the predicted Fi values to the Bi values. \n\nTo estimate Q errors for SWAP simulations, meteorological data were generated \n\nadvancing and retarding the variables one and two days in relation to the real meteorological \n\ndata presented in Figure 2.2.  This approach resulted in five sets of monthly values of Q for \n\nwhich the averages and standards deviation were obtained, showed by bars in Figure 2.6. \n\n \n\n2.2.6 Parameter sensitivity \n\n \n\nThe sensitivity of the SWAP model in relation to the crop (Kc, LAI, Kdif, Kdir, Rd, h3h \n\nand h3l) and hydrological soil parameters (?s, ?r, n, ? and ?) was performed before and after \n\nestablishing the standard values (Table 2.3) of the parameters for the simulation. Before the \n\nestablishment of standard values, a visual analysis was carried out by trial and error to detect \n\nthe most sensitive plant and soil parameters. Afterward, a second analysis of sensitivity for \n\nsoil parameters was made using several combinations of VG parameters. RMSE values were \n\nobtained replacing the standard combination of parameters by upper (?s\n+\n, ?r\n\n+\n, n\n\n+\n, ?\n\n+\n) and \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n \n\nlower (?s\n-\n, ?r\n\n-\n, n\n\n-\n, ?\n\n-\n) values, according to Table 2.2. Each parameter was substituted once and \n\nthe simulation with SWAP was performed.  In the case of crop parameters, they were changed \n\nby 10% and 50% of the standard combination (Table 2.3), to obtain RMSE values.  \n\n \n\n2.2.7 Irrigation scenarios and water productivity \n\n \n\nDifferent scenarios of irrigation were analyzed with the model, aiming to determine \n\nmore efficient water managements in relation to deep drainage losses and water use efficiency \n\nat the farm under study. The irrigation scenarios were classified according to irrigation \n\nfrequencies (IF), choosing intervals of 3 (IF3), 5 (IF5), 10 (IF10) and 15 (IF15) days between \n\napplications. For each IFi, the amount of water applied was obtained based on the net \n\nirrigation depth (ID) between 1 and 50 mm (discounting P from I within each period), and \n\nwhen precipitation was higher than or equal to ID, irrigation was not applied. The scenarios \n\nwith no irrigation and farmer irrigation management (IFFarmer) were also evaluated, totalizing \n\n34 setups (Table 2.4). The criterion for the irrigation scenarios was that I should not be too \n\nlow (i.e. &lt;40mm) or too high (i.e. > 900mm) during the year, ensuring the comparison \n\nbetween the scenarios for the several IF. \n\n \n\nTable 2.4 \u2013 Scenarios of irrigation generated for SWAP application \n\nIrrigation depth \n\n(mm) \n\nI (mm y\n-1\n\n) \n\nIF3 IF5 IF10 IF15 \n\n1 83 46 -\na\n - \n\n3 251 137 56 - \n\n5 421 228 94 55 \n\n8 688 365 151 89 \n\n11 900 511 209 122 \n\n14 - 668 269 155 \n\n17 - 826 329 189 \n\n20 - - 389 222 \n\n25 - - 490 278 \n\n30 - - 595 394 \n\n40 - - 823 460 \n\n50 - - - 594 \nNote: IF3, irrigation (I) applied each 3 days; IF5, irrigation applied each 5 days; \n\nIF10, irrigation applied each 10 days; IF15, irrigation applied each 15 days.  \na\n \u201c-\u201c represents not evaluated scenarios. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n For each irrigation scenario, the water productivity WPI+P (kg m\n-3\n\n), which relates crop \n\nyield to water use, and the actual yield Ya (t ha\n-1\n\n), were calculated by Equations (2.5) and \n\n(2.6), respectively, for the interpretation of the effects of the scenarios during a year of coffee \n\nproduction.  \n\npa\nI P\n\np\n\nYT\nWP\n\nT P I\n?\n\n? ?\n? ? ?\n\n?? ?\n    (2.5) \n\na\na p\n\np\n\nT\nY Y\n\nT\n?\n\n     (2.6) \n\nwhere Yp (t ha\n-1\n\n) is the biological productivity of coffee, corresponding to the dry matter yield. \n\nYp was calculated based on the coffee fruit productivity for 2008/2009 (3060 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n) and \n\nthe coffee harvest index of 0.012 (NAIR, 1993).  \n\nAs water is available in large quantities from rainfall and irrigation during the entire \n\nyear, water stress conditions were not expected to take place. Coffee fruit productivity used \n\nhere is the potential one. Calculated WP is a relative number because it was affected only by \n\nthe irrigation scenarios and meteorological data. The WP relation is a new way to characterize \n\nwater productivity, and it was described in details by Vazifedoust et al. (2008). \n\n \n\n2.3 Results and discussion \n\n \n\nAn application of the SWAP model is presented for a perennial crop during one \n\nexperimental year. SWAP input parameters and their influence on the simulations of the \n\ncomponents of the water balance Q and ETa were evaluated. For plant characterization, \n\nexperimental data and information from studies found in the literature were used, and a simple \n\ncoffee plant model was established for one year in 2008/2009. Water balances simulated by \n\nSWAP were then compared to a study developed in the same Cerrado area. After the model \n\ncalibration, scenarios of irrigation were appraised looking for the best management that would \n\nbenefit water and coffee productivity when compared to the farmer\u00b4s actual practices.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Sensitivity analysis and model calibration  \n\n \n\nTable 2.5 shows results of the RMSE for the estimations of Q for the several values of \n\n? and combinations of VG parameters. Soil hydrological parameters assumed either the upper \n\nor lower value of a given VG parameter, delimiting the 95% confidence interval. When one \n\nparameter had its value changed from the standard value, the others remained in the standard \n\ncombination. RMSE in relation to Q estimation was more sensitive to variations in ?. In this \n\nanalysis, we varied ? between 6 and -6, but for values of ? equal to -6 and one value for -3 the \n\nsimulations with SWAP resulted in the non-convergence of Richards\u2019 equation. Changes in \n\nVG parameters only affect the simulations of RMSE for Q slightly, and the shape parameter n \n\nhad the greatest influence. RMSE-value equal to zero corresponds to the standard combination \n\nof VG and Mualem parameters.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.5 \u2013 Sensitivity of the SWAP model for deep drainage Q prediction evaluated trough \n\nthe root mean square error (Q-RMSE), in relation to variations of the van Genuchten and \n\nMualem parameters, for chosen values of pore connectivity \n\n \n\n? \n    \n\nQ \u2013RMSE \n\n(mm)     \n\nSTD\nb\n n\n\n- \nn\n\n+ \n?\n\n- \n?\n\n+ \n?s\n\n-\n ?s\n\n+\n ?r\n\n-\n ?r\n\n+\n \n\n6 13.1 15.9 12 13 13.1 14.7 11.9 11.9 14.9 \n\n5 11.6 14.6 10.5 11.4 11.7 13.3 10.3 10.3 13.5 \n\n3 7.5 11.1 6.9 7.1 7.9 9.6 6.1 6.1 9.9 \n\n1 1.6 6.5 3.8 1.6 2.3 4.6 2.5 2.5 4.8 \n\n0.5 0 5.3 4.2 1.1 1.2 3.3 3.7 3.8 3.5 \n\n0 1.5 2.7 5.3 1.9 1.9 2.7 4.2 4.2 2.9 \n\n-1 5.7 2.7 10.1 6.3 4.9 5.7 6.8 6.8 5.8 \n\n-3 29.5 10 -\na\n 40.5 25 30.5 28.5 28.5 30.6 \n\n-6 - - - - - - - - - \nNote: ?, pore connectivity parameter of Mualem (1976); n\n\n-\n and ?\n\n-\n, shape parameter values of the lower limit of \n\n5% interval; n\n+\n and ?\n\n+\n shape parameter values of the upper limit of 5% interval; ?s\n\n-\n\n and ?s\n+\n\n, lower and upper \n\nvalues of saturated volumetric soil water content of the 5% interval; ?r\n-\n\n and ?r\n+\n\n, lower and upper values of \n\nresidual volumetric soil water content of the 5% interval;  \na\n Non-convergence of Richard\u2019s equation in SWAP. \n\nb \nSTD,\n\n \nStandard values of van Genuchten parameters. \n\n \n\nWe also studied the influence of Ks on model results of the water balance.

The effect that the \n\npore connectivity produces on the results of water balance components may be clarified by \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nthe behavior of the hydraulic conductivity function for different values of ?, shown in Figure \n\n2.3 \n\nAlmost all the h-values occurring during the experimental year remain in the range -60 \n\nto -15000 cm, where the K function can take several shapes depending on ?. An appropriate \n\nvalue of ? for the sandy soil should be determined, however, to obtain a more precise \n\nevaluation of the soil-plant system under study. Similar results of ? effects on the hydraulic \n\nconductivity function can be found in Sakai et al. (2009)  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Hydraulic conductivity K (cm d\n-1\n\n) versus soil water pressure head h (cm) for different \n\nvalues of the pore connectivity parameter ? \n\n \n\nSWAP results in Figure 2.4 showed the soil pressure head values between -1 and -25 \n\ncm was not reached in this study and, therefore, h1 did not affect the simulated results. \n\nPressure head h remains in the range of -100 and -15000 during the dry period and the range \n\nof -60 and -1000 cm during the rest of the year (wet period). In relation to soil evaporation, no \n\ndifference was found in the annual result when applying the procedures of Black, Gardner and \n\nThurtell (1969) or Boesten and Stroosnijder (1986). Soil evaporation simulated with SWAP is \n\nalmost insignificant (lower than 1 mm y\n-1\n\n) and consequently no effect would be expected to \n\nhappen when changing the method of calculation. \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 - Daily values of soil water pressure head h (cm) of the soil profile predicted by SWAP at \n\ndepths 0.5 to 95 cm, a) from July 31\nst\n to December 31\n\nst\n, 2008 and b) from January 1\n\nst\n to July 31\n\nst\n, 2009 \n\n \n\nTable 2.6 shows the results of SWAP sensitivity analysis in relation to selected plant \n\ninput parameters. As shown the results of Q-RMSE in this study, variations in the coffee light \n\nextinction coefficients (kdif and kdir), Rd, ic and LAI in the SWAP crop file did not affect  \n\nQ-values significantly. The parameters kdif and kdir are used in the calculation of soil \n\nevaporation, which in the conditions of the present study were very low, explaining the low \n\ninfluence of these parameters on the WB values. The LAI values estimated from leaf dry \n\nmatter data were relatively high (Table 2.3) compared to literature values, however they can \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nbe acceptable when comparing to measurements performed in 2-4 years old coffee plants in \n\nthe literature (GUTI\u00c9RREZ; MEINZER, 1994). The analysis of sensitivity of LAI was not \n\npossible for +10% and +50% of the standard value because the results were higher than the \n\nmaximum value allowable by SWAP. The critical soil water pressure head parameters were \n\nalso evaluated in the sensitivity analysis and did almost not influence Q simulations with \n\nSWAP. The parameter Kc effected SWAP simulations for Q considerably, as Q-RMSE \n\nvariations related to changes in this parameter were high. \n\n \n\nTable 2.6 \u2013 Sensitivity of the SWAP model for deep drainage Q \n\nprediction evaluated trough the root mean square error (Q-RMSE), \n\nin relation to variations in 10% and 50% of plant standard \n\nparameters \n\nPlant \n\nparameters \n\nQ-RMSE  \n\n(mm) \n\n50% 10% -10% -50% \n\nKdif 0.003 0.000 0.004 0.08 \n\nKdir 0.003 0.003 0.004 0.08 \n\nRd 1.90 1.00 0.80 1.50 \n\nKc 33.00 13.00 7.00 43.00 \n\nic 0.10 0.04 0.04 0.11 \n\nLAI -\na\n - 0.027 0.135 \n\nNote: Kdif, extinction coefficient for diffuse light; Kdir, extinction coefficient for \n\ndirect light; Rd, rooting length; Kc, crop factor; ic, interception coefficient of Von \n\nHoyningen-Hune and Braden; LAI, leaf area index;  \na\n Not evaluated. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Model comparison \n\n \n\nThe comparison between SWAP predictions and Bortolotto\u2019s values of Q and ETa is \n\nshown in Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.6. The monthly results of Q simulated with SWAP deviated \n\nfrom those of Bortolotto et al. (2012), presenting a linear relationship with R\u00b2 = 0.77 (Figure \n\n2.5a). Figure 2.5a shows specific months, those with the highest Q found during the year, \n\nresponsible for the deviation of the tendency line. The resulted RMSE for Q is around 43 mm, \n\na response to the predicted values in November and December of 2008, and March and April \n\nof 2009 (Figure 2.6). On these dates, a similar behavior for Q predictions by both models can \n\nbe observed: in the months of November and March, Q simulated by SWAP resulted lower \n\nthan the result of CWB, and in the respective next month of December and April, the inverse \n\nbehavior occurred, Q obtained by CWB was lower than the simulated by SWAP. In the \n\ncourse of simulations, the water saved in one month is delivered to the next two months for \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\nboth periods evaluated, the behavior of Q becoming closer to the 1:1 line in the third month of \n\nthe sequence (Figures 2.5a and 2.6a). \n\nThis behavior of retaining and distributing water during the following months is \n\nconfirmed when comparing the ETa curves simulated in SWAP with those obtained by \n\nBortolotto et al. (2012). These curves had similar results. Considering there are only two ways \n\nof losing water from this system (by evapotranspiration and drainage), the water transported \n\nby drainage Q in the simulations with SWAP is just distributed differently from Bortolotto\u2019s \n\nduring the year.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - Linear regression between Bortolotto et al.

However, h did not remain at these low values for a long time, a \n\nmaximum of 23 days for the 85 cm depth in September and 12 days for the 65 cm depth in \n\nOctober. The behavior of h in the 65-95 cm soil layer during the dry period can initially (from \n\nAugust to September) be understood by the infiltration of water from irrigation and later due \n\nto the rain events of September (P = 31 mm in four days) and the beginning of November  \n\n(P = 90.5 mm in two days). Irrigation water did not reach layers deeper than 95 cm during \n\nAugust and most of September, since h in this region decreases almost linearly and stabilizes \n\nat -15000 cm, increasing only due to the large rain event in late September. The rain events of \n\nNovember make the pressure head increase and become almost uniform along the soil profile. \n\nThe simulated Q is, therefore, nearly zero from August to October of 2008 (Figure 2.6a), \n\nconfirming there is no drainage due to irrigation during the dry period of the year. The water \n\ndelivered by irrigation and rainfall during the dry period is retained in the 1 m of the soil \n\nprofile and is kept available to plants or deep drainage in the wet period.  \n\nThe simulated results of ETa showed to be close to the observations of Bortolotto et al. \n\n(2012) since the linear regression between them was obtained with R\u00b2 = 0.9. However, the \n\nmodel SWAP predicted ETa values lower than those of CWB (Figure 2.5b). SWAP takes into \n\nconsideration plant characteristics as already mentioned for the estimation of Ea and Ta. Since \n\nthe ETa calculation in Bortotlotto et al. (2012) is based only on soil water storage variations \n\nand the amount of precipitation, we should not expect an exact agreement between \n\nBortolotto\u00b4s data and SWAP simulations.  \n\nThe uncertainties of SWAP modeling for Q due to the meteorological input data and \n\nvariations in Ks are shown in Figure 2.6a and 2.6b (see item 2.5). Based on the results of \n\nFigure 2.6a, we verified Q is highly influenced by the meteorological values and can vary \n\nmore in the wet months. During the dry period of the year the uncertainties are smaller, which \n\nlead to the conclusion Q is mainly governed by the precipitation. Figure 2.6b shows the \n\nuncertainties of Q simulated with SWAP due to variations of Ks values from 26 m d\n-1\n\n to 455 \n\nm d\n-1\n\n, measured by laboratory tests.  \n\nIn the CWB method, when the amount of precipitation of an event exceeds ETp and at \n\nthe same time soil available water capacity (AWC) is fulfilled due to antecedent rainfalls, \n\nthere is an excess of water considered to be Q. Results of drainage Q obtained in Bortolotto et \n\nal. (2012) present uncertainties however due to specific considerations on the AWC \n\ncalculations. In that study, the AWC was calculated as the difference in the soil water storage \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nat field capacity (considered to be characterized by h = -33 kPa) and at wilting point  \n\n(at h = -1,500 kPa). Nevertheless, the pressure head at field capacity can vary from -10 kPa to \n\n-33 kPa accordingly to the soil type and characteristics (RICHARDS; TIMM, 2004). \n\nIncreasing field capacity to h=-10 kPa, for example, would increase directly the AWC and \n\nreduce Q amount obtained by CWB. This change in AWC could possibly approximate the Q \n\nresults of CWB and SWAP model in Figure 2.6. \n\nTable 2.7 presents the components of the annual water balance obtained by SWAP and \n\nthe estimated results of Bortolotto et al. (2012). Although the monthly differences shown in \n\nFigure 2.6, the annual results of the components Q and ETa ended up very close. As shown by \n\nthe simulations of SWAP, only a small portion of the water entering the system during the \n\nyear is converted into Pi. However, this component is much higher than the annual Ea that was \n\n0.6 mm. These results could be consequences of the high density of leaves in the plantation \n\nsince the coffee plants are at full maturity. Conclusively, all the water assigned as ETa in \n\nTable 2.7 represents plant transpiration.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.7 \u2013 Components of the annual water balance simulated by SWAP \n\nand calculated by CWB of Bortolotto et al.

With this information, we planned to demonstrate the influence of I on \n\nQ, and also to analyze different possibilities of management, in contraposition to the choice of \n\nthe farmer. Usually, irrigation water is applied in several volumes distributed during the year \n\nby the farmers, and this routine is necessary because they fertigate the crop year round. \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n\nAlternatively, this information would also serve to lead farmers to adopt more sustainable \n\npractices of water management in this agricultural region. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 a) Annual drainage due irrigation only QdI (mm) and b) annual plant transpiration Ta \n\n(mm) for different irrigation frequencies (IF) as a function of the amount of water applied I (mm) \n\nthroughout the experimental year \n\n \n\nSWAP simulation with no irrigation yielded the value of QdP, the drainage only due to \n\nrainfall (833.4 mm), which is very high, showing the rainfall is the main factor responsible for \n\nQ in the annual balance. This value was subtracted from the total Q to obtain QdI, the drainage \n\ndue to irrigation only.  For all simulations of Figure 2.7a, we present QdI maintaining the \n\nactual rainfall (2008/2009). \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nEach of the four curves in Figure 2.7a was fitted to a 2\nnd\n\n order polynomial model to \n\nappreciate their behavior better. Results indicate that QdI values tend to be lower when the \n\nfrequency of irrigation is high (IF3), which can be verified comparing the results for a fixed I. \n\nAs an example, for 400 mm, the values of QdI from the respective regression curves are  \n\n24 mm for IF15, 63 mm for IF10, 109 mm for IF5, and 129 mm for IF3. In this case,  \n\nQdI increases 39 mm from IF15 to IF10, 46 mm from IF10 to IF5, and 20 mm from IF5 to IF3, \n\nshowing there is a considerable rise in QdI when reducing the irrigation frequency. Taking the \n\namount of water applied by farmers (I = 697 mm), the correspondent QdI is 134 mm (IF15), \n\n205 mm (IF10), 248 mm (IF5), and 282 (IF3). As it can be observed, farmer\u2019s irrigation \n\nmanagement (IFFarmer) practically encloses the IF10 curve. The IF10 and IF15 scenarios are \n\ncharacterized by having several days between applications of water and consequently in these \n\nscenarios there is no irrigation during the wet period of the year. \n\nPlant response to irrigation scenarios is presented in Figure 2.7b. For fixed values of I, \n\nTa increases as the frequency of irrigation (IF) decreases. Larger intervals of irrigation might \n\ninduce a drier microclimate in the canopy, therefore, increasing Ta.  Both results of Ta and  \n\nQ showed there is less loss of water by drainage (more loss by transpiration) when the \n\nirrigation is applied with greater time intervals.  For all the scenarios, there is a tendency of \n\nQdI and Ta to increase with the amount of water used yearly by the irrigation. \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 - a) Water productivity WPP+I (kg m\n-3\n\n) and b) actual yield Ya for different irrigation \n\nfrequencies (IF) and amount of water applied I (mm) throughout the experimental year \n\n \n\nThe effect of irrigation scenarios on the soil-plant system is interpreted in a different \n\nperspective when looking at water productivity (WP) outcomes. These results showed there is \n\na limit for the amount of water used during the year, which is confirmed by the peak values in \n\neach curve of Figure 2.8a. For the same amount of irrigation, the difference between WP for \n\nthe several IF-curves in Figure 2.8a does not pass 1.12 kg m\n-3\n\n (1.12 kg of dry matter per ha, \n\nper mm of water).  This relative low influence of I on the results of WPP+I can be attributed to \n\nthe dominant rainfall in this coffee cultivation region. In any case, when analyzing the \n\nefficiency of the irrigation scenarios, not only WP should be considered, but also the \n\nrespective Q. \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nThe maximum values of WPI+P obtained from the regression curves in Figure 2.8a \n\noccurred when I was between 530 and 630 mm.  When water was applied in intervals of 15 \n\ndays (IF15) during the year, the WP had the highest values. The best management practice, \n\nhowever, would bring benefits not just to water conservation, but also to coffee productivity. \n\nFigure 2.8b showed the actual coffee yield Ya increased as a results of I increments. Any \n\nirrigation scenario with I between 650 and 750 mm and water application intervals of 15 days \n\n(IF15) (Table 2.8), would result in higher Ya values and also of WP in relation to the farmer\u00b4s \n\nmanagement scenario (IFFarmer).  The scenario IFFarmer resulted in Ya equal to 238 t ha\n-1\n\n and \n\nWPI+P equal to 10.70 kg m\n-3 \n\n(10.70 kg ha\n-1\n\n mm\n-1\n\n), which is not so different from the most \n\nefficient irrigation management (WPI+P that is around 11.06 kg m\n-3\n\n, Figure 2.8a). In \n\ncomparison, when I is extrapolated to 700 mm, with IF15, Ya would result in 248 t ha\n-1\n\n, WPI+P \n\nin 10.90 kg m\n-3\n\n, and the corresponding QI reduced by 49 mm in comparison to the farmer\u2019s \n\nirrigation scenario. Considering the time scale of coffee cultivation can reach up to 18 years, a \n\nyearly reduction of QdI and the increase of Ya presented above, although relatively small, \n\nwould greatly benefit water conservation and groundwater pollution, as well as coffee \n\nproductivity. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.8 \u2013 Values of water productivity (WP), plant productivity (Ya), and bottom flux due irrigation (QdI) \n\nfor the scenarios of irrigation (I) and obtained from SWAP simulations \n\nI WP (kg m\n-\n\u00b3) Ya (t ha\n\n-1\n) QdI (mm) ?QdI\n\na\n (mm) \n\n(mm y\n-1\n\n) IF15 IF10 IF15 IF10 IF15 IF10 IFFarmer - IF15 IFFarmer - IF10 \n\n600 11.05 10.72 238 228 88 149 96 36 \n\n650 10.99 10.69 243 233 111 176 74 8 \n\n700 10.90 10.64 248 237 136 207 49 -22 \n\n750 10.78 10.56 253 241 163 240 22 -55 \n\n800 10.61 10.45 257 244 193 275 -8 -90 \n\nNote: IF15 and IF10, scenarios of irrigation with water application each 15 and 10 days, respectively; IFFarmer farmers\u2019 scenario of \n\nirrigation; ?QdI, difference between bottom flux due to irrigation only, using values obtained from IFFarmer (QdI = 185 mm), IF15 \nand IF10 scenarios.  \na\n Negative values means the bottom flux due to irrigation from IFFarmer is higher than the amount in the considered scenario. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nLow-frequency irrigation scenario could lead to a too dry soil condition in some \n\nperiods of the year, considering the annual rainfall distribution in the area defines wet and dry \n\nperiods. Evaluating the h-values in the soil profile for the scenario IF15 (I = 460.5 mm), as an \n\nexample, it can be verified the soil water depletion occurs during the months of September \n\nand October from depths 48 to 95 cm (Figure 2.9). When analyzing monthly data, these low \n\nvalues of h apparently have a potential effect on plant transpiration. From SWAP simulation \n\noutcomes, plant transpiration in September isTa = 107 mm (Tp = 145 mm) and in October is \n\nTa = 85 mm (Tp = 197 mm). Daily h-values in this soil layer reveal the soil remains close to \n\nwilting conditions for about 45 days and Ta tends to decrease and reaches almost zero three \n\ntimes. An excessive depletion of the available water can convey irreversible consequences in \n\ncoffee productivity and development, and this situation could occur for the scenarios with low \n\namounts of water applied in the IF15 or IF10 choices. On the other hand, the coffee plant stress \n\nby a lack of water during a certain period of the year could bring benefits for production, as \n\npresented in the technical report of Guerra et al. (2005).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Daily values of soil water pressure head h (cm) predicted by SWAP during the year at soil \n\ndepths of 0.5, 18, 48, 75 and 95 cm, for the irrigation scenario I equal to 460.5 mm and IF of 15 days \n\n  \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n \n\nWe analyzed a year in which rainfall was considerably high (1535 mm), and this is an \n\nimportant detail to be considered for a complete search of the best management practice. As \n\ncited before, rainfall averages range from 800 to 1800 mm and, therefore, in a dry year, the \n\nresults of the irrigation scenarios could be driven to distinct results of water use efficiency. \n\nThe stochastic employment of meteorological data or exclusively of the rainfall applied in \n\nSWAP would be highly recommended for a complete evaluation of the behavior of the \n\nirrigation scenarios and also for the analysis of climate effects. Bennett, Bishop and Vervoot \n\n(2013) introduced a stochastic approach with SWAP to quantify time and space uncertainties \n\nin deep drainage due to rainfall, land management and soil hydraulic properties in Australia. \n\nRainfall was the most important factor and a source of uncertainty to be considered for the \n\ndrainage predictions in that study, and precise rainfall data is required in such kind of study. \n\nAnother point to be concerned with is that the studied coffee plants were fully mature, and \n\nthese predictions should be re-evaluated for young coffee crops.   \n\nThis application of SWAP tried to find the best adjustment of the model to a perennial \n\ncrop and showed ways of using it to evaluate the possibility for improvements in irrigation \n\nmanagement. Some concerns exist nevertheless in respect to our evaluations, since the \n\noutcomes are restricted to the one-year of available experimental data, and a proper validation \n\nof model simulations was not possible. Our conclusions from the presented evaluations and \n\nscenarios with SWAP are subject to such limitations. \n\n \n\n2.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\n This study showed the potential of the SWAP model for studying a perennial crop in a \n\nCerrado ecosystem in Brazil and for generating irrigation scenarios. SWAP\u2019s most sensitive \n\ninput parameters were determined experimentally and other less sensitive were obtained from \n\nthe literature to establish the calibration. Model simulations for monthly drainage when \n\ncompared to the climatological water balance CWB data generated a determination coefficient \n\nR\u00b2 of 0.77. Therefore, we assumed SWAP is already a validated model widely tested and \n\nproved to be efficient in different parts of the world. For that reason, we could predict \n\nscenarios of irrigation for our region of coffee cultivation. \n\nIrrigation scenarios simulated with SWAP for the experimental year showed to be \n\nefficient in water use and coffee productivity when longer intervals of irrigation were used. \n\nAccording to this analysis, adopting an irrigation interval of 15 days and yearly water amount \n\nbetween 650 and 750 mm could be an option for better management compared to the farmer\u2019s \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nscenario.  The results of water productivity, plant productivity, and deep drainage indicated \n\nthe farmer\u2019s management practices could be improved, minimizing loss of water by drainage \n\nand at the same time increasing coffee production. The information presented here should \n\nsupport farmers to improve their water irrigation management practices and alert them to \n\nenvironmental losses that might occur in these heavily fertilized coffee plantations in western \n\nBahia, Brazil. \n\n Some concerns still exist, however, with respect to the performed simulations: 1) there \n\nwas limited experimental data for the simulations (a one-year period); this could be improved \n\nwith a new study with information about the coffee plant and the SWAP plant module being \n\nstructured year by year; 2) the absence of model validation with proper data; 3)  \n\nthe deterministic approach here used  could be replaced by a new stochastic evaluation \n\napplied to meteorological and soil hydrological data, to solve spatial and temporal limitations \n\nof the simulations. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nALLEN, R.G.; PEREIRA, L.S.; RAES, D.; SMITH, M.

An expected \n\nconsequence of excessive fertilizers use is the degradation of groundwater and surface water \n\nin and around agricultural ecosystems. The Brazilian Cerrado has suffered transformations by \n\nthe advance of intensive agriculture during the last decades, and information about current \n\nfield nutrient management and its environmental impact is needed to establish sustainable \n\npractices for this modified biome. Process-based models are a useful tool for evaluating such \n\naims under future scenarios. The coupled models SWAP/ANIMO were used in this study to \n\nsimulate leaching and plant uptake of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) in a Cerrado soil of Bahia, \n\nBrazil, cultivated with coffee at an intensive mineral fertigation management. Main model \n\nparameters were measured under field conditions and ANIMO was calibrated for a scenario \n\ncorresponding to an application with 400 kg N ha\n-1\n\ny\n-1\n\n mineral fertilizer. The model was tested \n\nwith independent data of NO3-N in soil solution measured in plots receiving 800 kg N ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1\n\n. \n\nStatistical analysis of the modeling with ANIMO showed the simulations were in agreement \n\nwith experimental measurements during one year of study. The measured average annual N \n\nplant uptake was similar to ANIMO predictions. Sensitivity analysis showed pH and \n\nreference temperature are critical for predictions of NO3-N leaching and concentration in soil \n\nsolution. Model predictions of the organic cycling due to manure applications, plant roots, and \n\nleaf deposition were also obtained. Transformations and leaching of organic N were not \n\nmeasured experimentally and could not be considered in model validation. Besides the model \n\nevaluation for mineral fertilizer, we also present data needed for modeling decomposition of \n\nsome organic fertilizers like poultry manure and coffee husks, which are widely used in \n\nsimilar agricultural systems. Obtained modeling results can give support for the \n\nimplementation of better strategies for mineral and organic N fertilizer management for the \n\nCerrado coffee production system of Bahia and alike production scenarios.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Nitrogen cycle, leaching, ANIMO model, Cerrado \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe Cerrado zone in Bahia, one of Brazil\u00b4s northeastern states, presented the highest \n\ncoffee productivity (average of 37.5 bags per hectare) of the country over the 2009-2014 \n\nperiod (CONAB, 2014). Its productivity was 22% higher than the second most productive \n\nregion, the Cerrado of the southeastern state of Minas Gerais. Although Cerrado soils are \n\nnotoriously infertile, the region in Bahia has several excellent qualities for modern \n\nagriculture. The flat land is accessible for planting, the sandy and sandy-loam soils are well \n\ndrained, and surface and underground water sources are available for crop cultivation with \n\nirrigation (GASPAR; CAMPOS, 2007). Moreover, the well-defined rainy season (October-\n\nApril) and an almost rainless season from May to September is a welcome climatic feature of \n\nthis region with respect to coffee cropping. Coffee production in the Cerrado of Bahia is only \n\npossible due to the combination of irrigation and fertilizing practices, however. \n\nFew studies evaluated the N processes occurring in the productive coffee cultivations \n\nof Bahia\u00b4s Cerrado and associated them to management practices. For this reason, it is \n\nquestionable whether fertilizers have been managed efficiently and in a sustainable way in \n\nthis region. Existing studies on the N management for coffee cultivation on Cerrado soils did \n\nnot solve these questions. Bruno et al. (2014) studied the N efficiency uptake by mature \n\ncoffee plants in western Bahia for different doses, concluding that a reduction from 600 to \n\n200 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n was possible without reducing crop productivity and decreasing the leaching \n\nof N to groundwater. A study by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) \n\nresulted in the same dose (200 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n) for a maximum coffee yield on an Oxisol in the \n\ncentral Cerrado (SANZONOWICZ et al., 2003). Neto et al. (2011) found a dose of around \n\n400 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1 \n\nto yield maximum productivity of coffee plants of Bahia\u2019s Cerrado. These \n\nare few achievements related to fertilization efficiency, and more studies need to be \n\ndeveloped for the successful continuity of coffee cultivation in the Cerrado region and an \n\nefficient production system with sustainable and non-polluting farming practices.  \n\nThe use of models is an important tool for understanding water and nutrient dynamics \n\nin agricultural systems, to evaluate sensitivities and to suggest strategies for reducing fertilizer \n\ninput and propose scenarios for better management. The hydrological model SWAP (VAN \n\nDAM et al., 2008) and the nutritional model ANIMO (GROENENDIJK et al., 2005) are both \n\nwidely used to simulate water and nutrient dynamics. SWAP simulates the physical \n\nmechanisms associated with water flow, heat flow and solute transport in the soil. ANIMO \n\nsimulates the cycles of C, N, and P in the soil, as well as greenhouse gas emissions, \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n\nemphasizing nutrient leaching together with decomposition, nitrification, denitrification, \n\nmineralization, immobilization, phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) soil sorption, and carbon (C) \n\ndynamics. Combined, SWAP and ANIMO are able to quantify nutrient losses and gains due \n\nto fertilization practices, water, soil and land management for various types of soils and \n\ndifferent hydrological conditions, and can be applied to studies on climate change and \n\nagricultural management scenarios (SHEPHERD et al., 2011). Both simulation models were \n\naccepted by the research community on water and nutrient dynamic studies with applications \n\nin several places around the world and for different aims (DROOGERS et al., 2000; \n\nMARINOV et al., 2005; SINGH et al., 2006; RUIZ et al., 2008; GUSEV et al., 2010; \n\nNOORY et al., 2011; MA et al., 2011; VERMA; GUPTA; ISAAC, 2012; CRESCIMANNO; \n\nMORGA; VENTRELL, 2012; DE JONG VAN LIER et al., 2015). \n\nIn this study, we performed a parameterization of ANIMO for a fertilized Cerrado \n\ncoffee cropping scenario assessing a recommendation for sustainable fertilizer use. The model \n\nwas calibrated and validated using data on N uptake by plants and nitrate concentration in the \n\nsoil solution. The model was used to predict the annual N balance for several fertilizer rate \n\nscenarios, and results were compared to observations obtained in field experiments with adult \n\ncoffee plants.  \n\n \n\n3.2 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Field data \n\n \n\nField data used for calibration and testing are described in Bruno et al. (2011) and \n\nBortolotto et al. (2011). These authors carried out an experiment from August 1, 2008, to July \n\n24, 2009, on a private coffee farm in Barreiras (11\u00b046 S, 45\u00b043\u2019 W) in the state of Bahia, \n\nBrazil. The area has virtually no slope (<1%) and was previously covered by Cerrado \n\nvegetation. The soil is classified as Typic Hapludox (SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2010), has low \n\nnatural fertility and is surrounded by remaining Cerrado ecosystem areas. Local precipitation \n\nranges from 582 to 1687 mm per year according to historical data (1961-2013) of the National \n\nInstitute of Meteorology (INMET). Wind speed, solar radiation, air temperature, and air \n\nhumidity were used from the INMET weather station of Barreiras. Precipitation and irrigation \n\nwere measured at the experimental field. \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nCoffee plants (Coffea arabica L., variety Catua\u00ed Vermelho) were seven years old at \n\nthe beginning of the experiment. The plant arrangement was circular, allowing irrigation and \n\nfertigation by a center pivot with a total irrigated area of 80 ha. Plants spacing was 3.8 m \n\nbetween lines (pivot circles) and 0.5 m between plants. In previous years, urea was applied as \n\nfertilizer by fertigation according to the expected crop productivity. The input of mineral N \n\nwas of the order of 600 kg N ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1\n\n.  \n\nIrrigation was performed by Low Energy Precision Application (LEPA) emitters, \n\nwhich distribute the water according to the circular coffee lines, avoiding water application in \n\nthe interrow. The operation of the pivot was continuous during the year and stopped only for \n\nharvest. An amount of 4 mm of water was applied every second day, and fertigation each \n\nfourteen days. The farmer\u00b4s practices for crop management included weed and pest control \n\nwith pesticides, applications of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), micronutrients, lime and \n\ngypsum and several organic materials. \n\nExperimental data from Bruno et al. (2011) were assembled to analyze the  \n\nN distribution in coffee plant compartments and to obtain an annual N balance for \n\napplications of four fertilizer doses, with four replicates. Sixteen plots with three plants each \n\nreceived urea at rates of 200, 400, 600 and 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. The annual amount of  \n\nN fertilizer was partitioned for application each 14 days, over one full year, following \n\nfarmer\u00b4s practice. The experiment was assembled in the fourth circle of the pivot (258 coffee \n\ntrees grown as a hedge), counted from the center, which was disconnected from the farmer\u00b4s \n\nfertigation schedule. The experimental parcels were randomly distributed along the circle. A \n\nschematic representation of the experimental plots is available in Bruno et al. (2011). \n\nSoil solution samples were taken using soil solution extractors, which were installed \n\nclose to the middle plant trunk only in the parcels that received 400 and 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. Soil \n\nsolution was sampled at the 1.0 m depth, every two weeks during the second half of 2008 and \n\nonce per month during the first half of 2009. Nitrate concentration in soil solution was \n\nmeasured by flow injection analysis.  \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Models and scenarios \n\n \n\nANIMO (GROENENDIJK et al., 2005) simulates carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus \n\ncycles in a one-dimensional layered soil-plant system and should be used in combination with \n\na hydrological model. Commonly used in association with ANIMO, the SWAP model \n\n(KROES et al., 2008) simulates spatio-temporal variations of soil water content and \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \n\ntemperature. Nutrient transport simulation by ANIMO is governed by the general formulation \n\nof the mass conservation and transport differential equation (GROENENDIJK et al., 2005; \n\nRENAUD et al., 2006). For additional information and details in relation to the ANIMO \n\nmodel and its operation, we refer to the studies of Berghuijs-van Dijk et al. (1985), \n\nGroenendijk et al. (2008), Roelsma and Hendriks (2014), Stolk et al. (2011) and De Willigen \n\net al. (2008). \n\nFor simulation purposes, the growing season (year) was subdivided in two periods of \n\nsix months: the first one from August to December 2008 and the second from January to July \n\n2009. Simulations referred exclusively to coffee plants, i.e., no weeds or interrow crops were \n\nconsidered. The seven-year-old coffee plantation on a sandy soil was described in the input \n\nfiles of ANIMO using data directly collected in the experimental setups together with \n\nscientific database information available in other published materials related to agriculture in \n\nthe Brazilian Cerrado area. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.1 Hydrological module (SWAP) \n\n \n\nThe hydrological data used for ANIMO simulations were obtained using the SWAP \n\nmodel (KROES et al., 2008) with hydraulic parameters for the soil profile down to 1 m depth, \n\nand these outcomes can be found in Pinto et al. (2015). Soil hydraulic parameters were \n\npreserved during ANIMO simulations (Table 3.1). For the deeper soil layer (1.0-2.0 m) the \n\nhydrological parameters were obtained by fitting the Van Genuchten (1980) equation with \n\nMualem parametric restriction to data obtained from disturbed soil samples (R\u00b2 = 0.92) using \n\nthe software RETC (VAN GENUCHTEN et al., 1991). The shape parameter ? for the deeper \n\nsoil layer was obtained by inverse modeling.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Van Genuchten-Mualem soil hydraulic parameters used in SWAP \n\nsimulations \n\nSoil layer \n\n(m) \n\n?r \n\n(cm\n3\n cm\n\n-3\n) \n\n?s \n\n(cm\n3\n cm\n\n-3\n) \n\n? \n\n(cm\n-1\n\n) \nn \n\nKs \n\n(m d\n-1\n\n) \n? \n\n0-1.0 0.096 0.387 0.0169 1.636 0.266 0.5 \n\n1.0-2.0 0.115 0.525 0.0127 2.040 0.310 0.5\na\n \n\nNote: ?r, residual volumetric soil water content; ?s, saturated volumetric soil water \n\ncontent; n, ? and ? the shape parameters of the retention curve; and Ks the saturated \n\nhydraulic conductivity. VG parameters were obtained with a determination \n\ncoefficient R\u00b2 = 0.88 (soil layer 0 \u2013 1.0 m) and R\u00b2 = 0.92 (soil layer 1.0 \u2013 2.0 m).  \na\n Initial value before calibration \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2 Crop and soil parameters \n\n \n\nRelevant crop (coffee) parameters are shown in Table 3.2. The relation C/N and pH \n\nfor some Brazilian Cerrado soils and the estimations used in the present study are shown in \n\nTable 3.3. The estimated C/N ratio and pH of the soil in this study were comparable and close \n\nto values of other studies in the Cerrado. The depth of the root zone Zr (1.0 m) was \n\nmaintained constant during the experimental year. As observed in field tests, the majority of \n\nroots were found close to the soil surface. The soil layer with the relative highest root \n\nconcentration (100%) was adjusted in SWAP from soil surface until 0.6 m, decreasing \n\nlinearly down to 1% at the maximum root zone depth (1 m). The expected cumulative  \n\nN uptake (Up) values were obtained from data of N concentration and dry matter of the plant \n\nparts (leaves, branch, trunk, fruit, and litter) sampled during the year (BRUNO et al., 2011). \n\nThe Up was obtained for each plot of the study and a mean value was calculated at the end for \n\nthe simulations. The difference between the N accumulated in the whole plant at onset and \n\nend of the experiments was the expected N uptake during the experimental period. Plant \n\ntranspiration values were obtained from SWAP simulations. The parameter ?N\nmax\n\n was \n\nestablished by calibration, to be discussed later.  \n\nSoil temperature was obtained by a numerical approach available in the SWAP model, \n\nmaking use of soil texture data, soil water and air volume fraction, and air temperature as the \n\ntop boundary conditions. Initial amounts of NH4-N and NO3-N in the soil solution of \n\ncompartments as required for ANIMO simulations were considered equal to zero for both \n\ninorganic N forms, since no soil solution analyzes for N concentrations were made in the \n\nbeginning of the experiment (BORTOLOTTO et al., 2013) due to the occurrence of very low \n\nsoil water contents. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Soil and plant input parameters used in ANIMO simulations for a Typic Hapludox \n\n(Soil Survey Staff, 2010) and Coffea Arabica L., variety Catua\u00ed Vermelho \n\nDescription \nParameter  \n\nsymbol \nValue Unit \n\nSoil \n\n   Thickness of Surface layer (0-0.1m) ?z1 0.1 m \n\nThickness of intermediary layer (0.1-1.0m) ?z2 0.9 m \n\nThickness of deep layer (1.0-2.0m) ?z3 1.0 m \n\nThickness of top soil compartment ?ztop 0.02 m \n\nThickness of the reservoir for additions ?zres 0.05 m \n\nDiffusion coefficient (Surface layer) p1 2.00\na\n - \n\nDiffusion coefficient (Intermediate and deeper \n\nlayers) p2 3.00\nab\n\n - \n\nSaturated hydraulic conductivity of the root zone \n\n(Surface and intermediate layers) Ksr 0.266 m d\n-1\n\n \n\nSaturated hydraulic conductivity of root zone  \n\n(Deeper layer) Ksr 0.310 m d\n-1\n\n \n\nDry bulk density (Surface layer) ?d1 1790 kg m\n-3\n\n \n\nDry bulk density (Intermediate layer) ?d2 1580 kg m\n-3\n\n \n\nDry bulk density (Deeper layer) ?d3 1480 kg m\n-3\n\n \n\nSoil carbon-nitrogen ratio (Soil profile) C/N 10 - \n\nCoefficient for organic matter transformations and \n\nnitrification An 74826\na\n J mol\n\n-1\n \n\nCoefficient for dissolved  organic matter \n\ntransformations\n \n Ad 74826\n\na\n J mol\n\n-2\n \n\nSoil pH (Surface layer) pH1 4.1\nb\n - \n\nSoil pH (Intermediate and deeper layers) pH2 3.8\nb\n - \n\nNH4 sorption coefficient (Soil profile) sNH4 0.0003\nb\n m\n\n3\n kg\n\n-1\n \n\nReference temperature Tref 25.0\nb\n \u00baC \n\n    Plant \n\n   Depth of initial root zone Zr 1.00 m \n\nPlant residues (roots) Pr 1426 kg ha\n-1\n\n \n\n\u201cSowing\u201d date (in the year of 2008) tp 213 Julian day \n\nHarvesting date (in the year of 2009) th 212 Julian day \n\nTransitional data for uptake periods tc 365 Julian day \n\nCumulative transpiration in the first period Ta1 0.59 m \n\nCumulative transpiration in the second period Ta2 0.60 m \n\nMaximum N transpiration stream concentration \n\nfactor ?N\nmax\n\n 4.0\nb\n - \n\na\n According to Groenendijk et al.

The input of annual N dry deposition was assessed using the N wet \n\ndeposition data predicted with ANIMO and the ratio values of the annual dry and wet \n\ndeposition for NH4-N (IdNH4/ IwNH4) and NO3-N (IdNO3/ IwNO3) found in North and South \n\nAmerica (Table 3.5). As water used for irrigation during the experiment was taken from the \n\nnearest by river, but concentrations of inorganic N were not measured in the irrigation water, \n\nwe used the N concentration from streams and rivers of the Cerrado biome reported by Hunke \n\net al. (2015). Although the rivers from the exact location of this research are not included in \n\nthis dataset, an average value of these data was considered acceptable for our purpose, mainly \n\nbecause this input is low compared to fertilizer applications. \n\nFertilizing was done with urea, with the addition of poultry manure and dry coffee \n\nhusks. After applied to the soil, urea molecules in solution are mostly transformed into NH4, \n\ndue to the action of the urease enzyme, or they percolate out of the root zone and are \n\nhydrolyzed afterward.

Dead plant root material (Pr) was characterized using data of root \n\ndry matter (RDM) obtained on day 0, 181, 265, and 356 from plants of the experimental site. \n\nDuring the experimental year, RDM maximum occurred on day 265 (10131 kg ha\n-1\n\n) and \n\ndecreased to a lower value on day 356 (8705 kg ha\n-1\n\n) (BRUNO et al., 2011). As RDM \n\nincreased from the beginning of the experimental analysis until day 265 we could not estimate \n\nthe amount of dead roots added to the soil during this period. However, from day 265 on, we \n\nassumed the reduction in RDM until day 356 was delivered to the soil. A general rate of \n\ndecomposition value for roots was recommended by Wu and McCechan (1998) Litter was \n\nparameterized with available data of N concentration and dry matter. The litter decomposition \n\nrate constant was estimated as the ratio between the annual mass of deposited leaves and the \n\nremaining leaves on the ground (OLSON, 1963). We considered a mean value for kli for all \n\nstudied plant parcels, although the calculated values were different for the several parcels or  \n\nN doses.

(2011). Four levels of N doses were used with ANIMO: 200, 400, 600 and \n\n800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n, identified by M200, M400, M600, and M800 respectively. Each N-management \n\nscenario consisted of 27 mineral N applications during one year (one application each 14 \n\ndays).  \n\n \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n3.2.2.4.2 Scenarios of N dose partition (part 2) \n\n \n\nTo evaluate the effects of annual N doses and fertilizer partition during the year on N \n\nplant uptake efficiency (NUpE) (Equation 3.1) and on NO3-N leaching accumulated during \n\none year, scenarios of N management were generated as described forward.  The doses of \n\n200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n were evaluated for the following \n\nfrequencies of applications (dose partition): i) N application every second day (NA1/2d) ; ii) \n\nonce a week (NA1/1w); iii) each 14 days (NA1/2w); iv) once a month (NA1/1m); v) seven times \n\nduring the year (NA7/12m); and vi) three times during one year (NA3/12m). The models \n\nSWAP/ANIMO generated a total of 48 scenarios from the combinations of different N \n\namounts and dose partitions during the year. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.4.3 Scenarios of precipitation amount (part 3) \n\n \n\nTo evaluate the effects of annual precipitation amounts on simulations of plant N \n\nuptake efficiency (NUpE) (Equation 3.1) and on NO3-N leaching accumulated during one \n\nyear, different scenarios of precipitation amounts (table 3.10) were generated and evaluated. \n\nThe scenarios of precipitation were generated based on daily precipitation events occurred \n\nduring the experimental period in 2008/2009. According to the wanted scenarios, we \n\nincreased (MaP30) or reduced (AP03-13, APr10, APr20, MiP30) the amount of precipitation of \n\ndefault events of the yearly precipitation regime used for SWAP/ANIMO calibration and \n\nvalidation. For the scenarios with reduced precipitation, supplementary irrigation was \n\nscheduled in the SWAP module for maintaining the average soil water storage at field \n\ncapacity (-10 kPa). For this scheme of scenarios the yearly doses of 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, \n\n700, and 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n were evaluated with N applications each 14 days. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n \n\nTable 3.10 \u2013 Yearly amount of precipitation selected for simulations of scenarios \n\nDescription Identification \n\nPrecipitation \n\namount \n\n(mm) \n\nAnnual precipitation used in SWAP/ANIMO \n\nvalidation \nPDefaut 1535 \n\nAverage annual precipitation in Barreiras  \n\n(2003-2013) \nAP03-13 957 \n\nAverage annual precipitation in Barreiras  \n\nreduced 10% \nAPr10 861 \n\nAverage annual precipitation in Barreiras  \n\nreduced 20% \nAPr20 766 \n\nHistorical annual maximum precipitation in \n\nBarreiras (30 years) \nMaP30 1687 \n\nHistorical annual minimum precipitation in \n\nBarreiras (30 years) \nMiP30 582 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2.4.4 Organic inputs and volatilization \n\n \n\nThe following managements were equally used for all the scenarios of simulation \n\ndescribed above in part 1, part 2 and part 3 sections. \n\nCoffee leaf fall was simulated scheduling the addition of the litter material to the soil \n\nsurface each 14 days, with a cumulative yearly mass of 8031.5 kg ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1\n\n. Poultry manure (2.5 \n\nMg ha\n-1\n\n) and coffee husks (3.0 Mg ha\n-1\n\n) were applied on the soil surface once on DAB = 71 \n\n(NETO et al., 2011). The events of material inputs were scheduled in the management module \n\nof ANIMO accordingly to the experimental sequence. The model applications of mineral \n\nfertilizer were made in the artificial reservoir of the soil existing in ANIMO and the organic \n\nparts of the plant in the first compartment, as recommended by Renaud et al. (2006).  \n\nThe percentage of N volatilized from mineral fertilizer was estimated according to soil water \n\ncontent on the day and day after fertilizer application and adjusted in the model (Table 3.11). \n\n \n\nTable 3.11 \u2013 Percentages of NH3 volatilization from mineral fertilization according to the soil \n\nmoisture status on several days after the beginning of the simulations (DAB) \n\nRain or irrigation NH3 volatilization DAB \n\n \n(%) (Julian day) \n\nOn day and next 0.0 15, 85, 99, 155, 323, 337, 351, 141 \n\nOn day 0.5 1, 43, 127, 169, 183, 295 \n\nOn next day 5.0 29, 57, 71 \n\nNo rain or irrigation 10.0 113, 197, 211, 225, 239, 253, 267, 281, 309, 365 \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) \n\n   \n\nThe efficiency of N uptake (NUpE) was calculated by the Equation 3.1, which is an \n\nadaptation of the relation proposed by Moll, Kamprath and Jackson (1982). \n\n \n\n(N plant uptake).(% of N taken from fertilizer)\n\nN fertilizer dose\nNUpE ?

(2011). \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Model sensitivity analysis \n\n \n\nThe sensitivity of ANIMO simulations to parameter variations was calculated using \n\nthe relative partial sensitive index ? (Equation 3.2). For this analysis, a selected parameter \n\nwas changed by 1% (?p/p=0.01) while others were maintained at default. The effect on \n\nannual results of each N cycle process (?V/V) were obtained and analyzed: \n\n \n\n/\n\n/\n?\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\nV V p V\n\np p V p\n\n     (3.2)\n\n \n\nIn this study a value of |?|?0.5 was interpreted as a low sensitivity of the output (the N \n\nprocess under evaluation) to the chosen parameter. Two scenarios of N management (M400 \n\nand M800) were evaluated for parameter sensitivity analysis. The parameters analyzed by the \n\nindex ? were chosen after a screening of sensitivity to find the most important parameters to \n\nbe evaluated. Soil parameters (pH, Ksr, ?d, sNH4 and Tref), plant parameters (?N\nmax\n\n, Up, and Ta), \n\nand materials and transformation process parameters (cNfr, cNsr, kfr, ksr, knr, N dose, and \n\nvolatilization percentage) were selected for the sensitivity evaluation. The most sensitive \n\nparameters were in this way selected for model calibration.   \n\n \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\n \n\n3.2.5 Model calibration and validation \n\n \n\nThe experimental outcomes from 200, 400, 600 and 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n doses of mineral \n\nN fertilizer were used for model calibration and validation. As four independent groups of \n\ndata were available, the calibration was performed using the experimental data of NO3-N \n\nconcentration in soil solution measured in four parcels of three plants that received \n\n400 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n during 2008/2009. The model simulations were validated using two \n\ndifferent output variables, which were measured experimentally: 1) the NO3-N concentration \n\nin soil solution for plant plots receiving 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n; 2) the plant uptake after one year \n\nobtained in plots receiving 200, 400, 600 and 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. To generate results, each \n\nfertilizer management (M200, M400, M600, M800) simulated with ANIMO used the same group \n\nof parameters established by calibration. \n\nSoil parameters pH, sNH4, kfr and cNfr of poultry manure, knr, kd, ?N\nmax\n\n, khu, kDOM, cNhu, \n\n(ANIMO), the shape parameter ?dsl and the root density (SWAP) were adjusted during model \n\ncalibration. Several combinations of parameters were tested according to ranges between \n\nmaximum and minimum values for each parameter available in Renaud et al. (2006). The best \n\ncombination of parameters was found to be ?dsl = 6.0, soil pH1 = 4.3 (surface layer) and pH2 = \n\n3.8 (middle and deep layer), sNH4 = 0.0003 m\n3\n kg\n\n-1\n (soil profile), kfr = 10.2 and cNfr = \n\n0.07 kg kg\n-1\n\n (Poultry manure), knr = 400 y\n-1\n\n, kd = 365 y\n-1\n\n, ?N\nmax\n\n = 3.5, khu = 0.008 y\n-1\n\n, kDOM = \n\n30 y\n-1\n\n, and cNhu = 0.001 kg kg\n-1\n\n. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n3.2.6 Model evaluation \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis of the model simulations and consistency with experimental data \n\nwas performed using the root mean square error RMSE, the index of agreement d \n\n(WILLMOTT, 1981) and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency NSE (NASH; SUTCLIFFE, \n\n1970). \n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n( )\n\nN\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nRMSE J O\nN ?\n\n? ??

The sensitivity analysis of ANIMO \n\nsimulations was performed for two scenarios of N management (400 and 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n), \n\nand results obtained independently are shown in Tables 3.12 and 3.13. \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.12 \u2013 Parameter sensitivity and effects of their increase on N processes simulated by ANIMO when N dose was 400kg ha\n-1\n\n \n\nParameter \nDefault \n\nvalue \n\nRelative partial sensitivity ?* \n\nCrop \n\nuptake \n\nNO3-N \n\nleaching \n\nNH4-N \n\nleaching \n\nNH4-N \n\nnitrified \n\nNorg \n\nmineralized \n\nNorg \n\nLeaching \n\nNO3-N \n\ndenitrification \n\npH1 4.3 0.82 2.92 1.00 4.70 4.79 2.01 8.22 \n\npH2 3.8 0.31 5.15 -3.00 3.26 3.04 -0.50 0.00 \n\n?d1 1790 0.02 0.00 0.00 -0.13 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\n?d2 1580 0.04 -0.17 0.00 -0.17 0.00 -0.25 0.00 \n\ns1NH4 0.0003 0.02 0.00 0.00 -0.13 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\ns2NH4 0.0003 0.04 -0.17 0.00 -0.17 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\nTref 25 -0.29 -2.23 1.00 -2.20 -2.13 -0.75 -1.37 \n\n?N\nmax\n\n 3.5 0.09 -0.52 0.00 -0.17 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\nUp1 147.192 0.18 -0.69 0.00 -0.51 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\nUp2 343.447 0.00 0.00 0.00 -0.08 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\nTa1 0.59 -0.16 0.86 1.00 0.38 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\nTa2 0.6 0.04 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\ncNfr (Poultry manure) 0.07 0.02 0.17 0.00 0.13 0.38 0.25 0.00 \n\nkfr (Poultry manure) 10.2 0.02 0.17 0.00 0.04 0.23 0.00 0.00 \n\nknr 400 -0.02 0.52 -1.00 0.55 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\nN dose 400 0.62 1.37 1.00 0.93 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\n% of volatilization  -\na\n -0.02 0.00 0.00 -0.04 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\nNote: pH1, soil pH of surface layer (0-0.1m); pH2, soil pH of intermediary (0.1-1.0m) and deep layers (1.0-2.0m); ?d1, dry bulk density of surface layer; \n\n?d2, dry bulk density of intermediary and deep layers; s1NH4, sorption coefficient of surface layer; s2NH4, sorption coefficient of intermediary and deep \n\nlayers; Tref, temperature of reference; ?N\nmax\n\n , maximum N transpiration stream concentration factor; Up1 and Up2, expected cumulative uptake in the first \n\nand second period, respectively; Ta1 and Ta2, transpiration  in the first and second period, respectively; cNfr , nitrogen concentration in fast reaction part \n\nof organic materials;  kfr, decomposition rate constant of fast reaction part organic materials; knr, nitrification rate of reference. \na \nTable 3.11 \n\n*\nPositive/negative value means an increase/decrease in the N process simulated in relation to its value when simulated with the standard combinations \n\nof parameters; \u201cZero\u201d means insignificant or none changes in N process simulated with the modified parameter.

Denitrification was sensitive to Ksr, and NH4-N leaching was sensitive to the \n\nsorption coefficient only for the N dose of 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. An increase on Ksr diminished \n\nthe availability of NO3-N for denitrification since plant roots absorb preferentially nitrate \n\nfrom the soil surface in M800 (these results are discussed ahead). In spite of increasing Ksr, \n\nplant N uptake was not affected in our simulations. The increase in parameter ?N\nmax\n\n produced \n\na decrease in NO3-N leaching but did not significantly change plant uptake for a dose of \n\n400 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. ANIMO has distinct calculation schemes for plant uptake depending on N \n\nsoil availability. The maximum concentration factor ?N\nmax\n\n is important only when NO3-N is \n\nnot highly available in the system and its amount is lower than plant requirements (without \n\nluxurious uptake). When the dose of N was 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n, a large amount of NO3-N was \n\npresented in the system due to ammonium nitrification and ?N\nmax\n\n did not regulate plant uptake \n\nor even influenced N leaching. In fact, the maximum transpiration concentration factor ?N\nmax\n\n \n\nwas not critical for our simulations with high doses of N. The expected uptake Up2 and \n\ntranspiration Ta2 of the second period were sensitive for crop uptake, NO3-N and NH4-N \n\nleaching simulations when a dose of 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n was applied. However, no influence of \n\nthese parameters on the tested N processes was found when the N dose was 400 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. \n\nThe cumulative Ta1 was sensitive for the simulated leaching of NO3-N (M400 and M800) and \n\nNH4-N (M400). The input Up1 was sensitive for NO3-N leaching in both managements. When \n\nthe expected uptake Up was increased we could predict less nutrient would be available for \n\nleaching. However, we could not explain why plant uptake decreased at the same time \n\ntranspiration Ta1 increased when the inverse behavior would be expected. The reason why the \n\nUp2 and Ta2 sensitivity behaviors were different for the management scenarios M400 and M800 \n\nis as well unclear. \n\nPlant uptake was significantly influenced by soil pH and by the small increases in the \n\nN dose for M400. The most important parameters for plant uptake in the management scenario \n\nM800 were Up2 and Ta2, and for leaching of NO3-N and NH4-N independently, and NH4-N \n\nnitrification, were soil pH, Tref, and knr for both management scenarios in the sensitivity \n\nanalysis. The leaching of NO3-N and NH4-N were highly affected when the N dose was \n\nincreased by 1% in both managements M400 and M800 as well. Comparing the sensitivity \n\nindexes of NH4-N leaching in the table 3.12 with the results in table 3.13, different values of ? \n\nwere found when the annual dose was 400 or 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-\n1.The leaching of NH4-N was \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\naffected by several parameters when the N dose was the higher. The processes of Norg \n\nmineralization, Norg leaching, and NO3-N denitrification were largely influenced by soil pH \n\nand Tref, and their sensitivities to the tested parameters were similar for both doses.  \n\nSoil pH strongly affected the N processes simulated in this study. Simulated results of \n\nNH4-N nitrification, NO3-N leaching, and Norg mineralization increased around 5% for a soil \n\nsurface pH increase of 1% (Table 3.12). Leaching of NH4-N was highly affected (-11%) by \n\nsoil pH increase as shown by the sensitivity analysis of the scenario with N dose \n\n800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (Table 3.13). The observed high influence of soil pH on the simulations is \n\nstrongly related to the high amounts of fertilizer and rate of nitrification occurring in this \n\nsystem. The NH4-N nitrification is regulated by environmental factors and depends on soil \n\nmoisture, temperature, aeration and soil pH. An exponential effect of soil pH on nitrification \n\nis adopted in ANIMO (RENAUD et al., 2006). The fact that soil pH was characterized for \n\nonly three soil layers (Table 3.2) and an average value was accounted for each layer could \n\nalso be determinant for the analysis of the presented results. Time variation of soil pH was \n\ndesirable for the simulations, but this is still a missing behavior in the model. For fertilized \n\nagricultural systems, soil pH variations during time are expected to exist. Results in the \n\nliterature showed soil pH can vary on long-term (SCHRODER et al., 2011) and short-term \n\n(TONG; XU, 2012) due to fertilizer reactions on soil and induced nitrification, or due to \n\nadditions of agricultural products for improvement of soil quality. For a more realistic \n\nmodeling of highly fertilized agricultural systems and a best estimative of N processes, we \n\nsuggest ANIMO to have soil pH revised as being variable in time and influenced by \n\nprocesses, plants, and input materials. \n\nThe simulated N losses by volatilization were not affected by the parameters evaluated \n\nin table 3.12 and 3.13, but only by the small variations of the N dose (resulting in ?=2.16, for \n\nM400, and ?=0.71, for M800). The soil and material parameters (p1, p2, ?d1, Ksr, C/N, cNex, cNhu, \n\ncDOM, cNsr of poultry manure and coffee husks, and ksr and kfr of coffee husks, and ksr of \n\npoultry manure, kex, kDOM, khu and kd) had very low or almost no influence on N simulations. \n\nThe N concentration in manures did not influence the N balance. These weak effects of \n\nmanures on simulation results can be explained by the low amount of poultry manure and \n\ncoffee husks used in the agricultural management system and by the slow rate  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n \n\nof decomposition of these materials, and consequently low amount of N input due to organic \n\nfertilizers in this system. A similar low sensitivity occurred for irrigation, natural wet, and dry \n\nN input since corresponding amounts of nutrients were very low compared to the mineral \n\nfertilizers. \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Aboveground N inputs \n\n \n\nTable 3.14 shows the several N inputs in this coffee cropping system resulting from \n\nsimulations under the established scenarios. \n\n \n\nTable 3.14 \u2013 Nitrogen inputs to the soil-plant system during the experimental year from \n\nseveral sources \n\nSource \nN fertilizer \n\nmanagement \n\nNH4-N \n\n(kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n) \n\nNO3-N \n\n(kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n) \n\nNorg \n\n(kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n) \n\nUrea (80% NH4-N, 20% NO3-N) M200 160 40 - \n\n M400 320 80 - \n\n M600 480 120 - \n\n M800 640 160 - \n\nDry deposition - 0.30 0.50 - \n\nWet deposition - 4.50 2.00 - \n\nIrrigation water - 0.30 0.10 0 \n\nCoffee litter - 0 0 209 \n\nCoffee husks - 0 0 41 \n\nPoultry manure - 1.00 0.10 74  \nNote: M200, M400, M600, and M800 are the simulated managements that differed only in relation to the amount of \n\nmineral fertilization added. \n\n*The same for all the managements \n\n \n\nANIMO requires initial values for the inorganic fractions NH4\n+\n, NO3\n\n-\n and organic \n\nfractions of the materials added, including mineral fertilizers. The amount of N available as \n\nurea was around 80% converted into NH4. Uncertainties like whether the urea fertilizer should \n\nbe either understood as a totally ammoniacal fertilizer or adjusted with nitrate/ammonium \n\npercentages as a result of the calibration may exist in such modeling. Although urea-N \n\nconverts rapidly to NH4 in soil, to consider a total conversion of urea-N into ammonium prior \n\nto application in the soil of simulations with ANIMO may be a gross approximation of reality. \n\nOther processes in the field might affect this fertilizer before its conversion into ammonium, \n\nfor instance, leaching and runoff, and a distinct scenario of the N cycle in the simulations \n\nmight happen compared to the real field system. Besides dividing them into forms of N, an \n\noption for characterizing the mineral N fertilizers would improve the simulation of chemical \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\nreactions of mineral fertilizers in the soil by ANIMO. The adopted features of urea in this \n\nstudy were obtained based on a slow reaction of the fertilizer in the soil and as a result of \n\nmodel calibration. Kaufmann et al. (2014), for instance, described urea as mostly being \n\nconverted to NO3 in ANIMO simulations but did not give a specific reason for this \n\nconsideration. \n\nNo differences in added organic N, like amounts of poultry manure, coffee husk, \n\ndiscarded coffee roots and plant litter were introduced in the simulated scenarios. Poultry \n\nmanure was the only organic material containing NH4-N and NO3-N. Due to its dependence \n\non animal management and added litter (for poultry litter), variations in contents and \n\ncomposition of organic N in poultry manure are common. For that reason, this study \n\npresented scientific data related to poultry manure analyzed by some studies from different \n\nlocations in Brazil (Table 3.6). Organic compounds and plant parts together showed to be \n\ngreat sources of organic N for the system. As presented ahead, the organic N inputs due to \n\nmanures and plant litter were an important source of NH4 since they were linked to the \n\nmineralization process. \n\nThe estimated N wet deposition was of the same order of magnitude as reported by \n\nAraujo (2015) for southeast Bahia, 2.7 kg ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1\n\n (NH4-N and NO3-N). The average inorganic \n\nN concentration assumed for irrigation water was comparable to values found by Lucio \n\n(2010), who obtained concentrations of NO3-N between 2.0?10\n-4\n\n kg m\n-3\n\n and 1.5?10\n-3\n\n kg m\n-3\n\n, \n\nand NH4-N between 4.7?10\n-5\n\n kg m\n-3 \n\nand 1.5?10\n-3\n\n kg m\n-3\n\n in samples of the Cachoeira River, \n\nBahia. Higher concentrations of NO3-N, between 3.4?10\n-1\n\n kg m\n-3\n\n and 7.0?10\n-1\n\n kg m\n-3\n\n, were \n\nfound by Santos et al. (2013) in the Catol\u00e9 River, in the southeast region of Bahia.  \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Calibration and validation \n\n \n\nThe temporal evolutions of the NO3-N concentration at 1 m depth for calibration \n\n(M400) and validation (M800) are shown in Figure 3.1. The calibration curve (Figure 3.1a) \n\nshowed less variability than the experimental observations but represented the cumulative \n\nbehavior of soil NO3-N until the end of the period. During the first 100 days of simulation, the \n\nconcentration of NO3-N increased very slowly, in agreement to the dry season (Figure 2.2). \n\nDuring this period, the NO3-N concentration in the soil could not be measured experimentally \n\ndue to the very dry soil condition. A visual examination of the validation curve (Figure 3.1b) \n\nshow it to represent well the experimental data, although the simulated curve underestimates \n\nsome observed values and did not reach the high levels observed on days 190 and 263, in the \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n \n\nwet period. The concentration of NO3-N in the soil decreased during the period between days \n\n291 and 321 for both the calibration and the validation scenario, but this did not show up in \n\nthe simulation results. This decline of nitrate concentration in the soil solution may be \n\nassociated to higher plant absorption. According to Bruno et al. (2011), coffee fruit N \n\nrecovery started on day 181 and continued until day 356, this period being the most \n\nrecommended for N application. However, these peak demands for N by plants were not \n\nsimulated in ANIMO and might be associated to the period in which both calibration and \n\nvalidation curves did not follow exactly the experimental results. The choice for zero initial \n\nconcentrations of NO3-N and NH4-N in soil solution lead to acceptable results since the first \n\nmeasurements agreed very well with simulations (Figure 3.1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Simulated and experimental daily concentrations of NO3-N at the 1 m soil depth \n\nas a function of days after the beginning of experiments (DAB), during the experimental year \n\nin the (a) calibration with scenario M400 and (b) validation with scenario M800 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nTo quantitatively evaluate the model outcomes, simulated concentrations of NO3-N \n\nbetween 0.1 m and 1.4 m depths were statistically compared to the experimental values at \n\n1.0 m (Table 3.15). RMSE and d index for the calibration simulations did not vary \n\nconsiderably in the soil region between 0.8 m and 1.0 m, and statistical results for 1.0 m \n\nindicated an accurate simulation and calibration (GROENENDIJK et al., 2014). The \n\nsimulations of NO3-N at 1.0 m depth for validation were of medium quality as revealed by \n\nNSE values but of good quality according to RMSE and d index. In relation to RMSE, both \n\nthe calibration and the validation showed relatively low values at 1.0 m depth. Deviations on \n\nthe validation curve were mainly caused by NO3-N concentrations measured on days 190, 263 \n\nand 321. When these outliers were eliminated from validation, results were NSE = 0.90 and \n\nindex d = 0.93 at 1.0 m depth. Different scenarios for the initial NO3-N and NH4-N \n\nconcentration in soil solution were evaluated also accounting for the output values of these \n\ninorganic forms simulated in soil solution after one year of M200, M400, and M600. After \n\nevaluating the statistical parameters, we found the accordance between experimental and \n\nsimulated amounts of NO3-N in the soil at 1.0 m depth would be lower than the original (zero \n\nconcentrations) for each of those tested scenarios.  \n\nAn important point to be taken into consideration is that the available experimental \n\ndata are average of several plots. The experimental values of NO3-N concentrations shown in \n\nFigure 3.1 were obtained from composite soil water samples taken from four replicates of \n\nexperimental parcels of M400 (calibration) and of M800 (validation). The calibration and \n\nvalidation of ANIMO simulations relied on a few NO3-N concentration measurements for the \n\nstatistical analysis here presented.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n \n\nTable 3.15 \u2013 Values of the statistical relations root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe \n\nmodel efficiency (NSE) and index of agreement (d) resulted from the calibration and \n\nvalidation \n\nSoil depth RMSE (10\n-3\n\n kg m\n-3\n\n) \n\n \n\nNSE \n\n \n\nd \n\n(m) Calibration Validation \n\n \n\nCalibration Validation \n\n \n\nCalibration Validation \n\n0.1 4.0 11.4 \n\n \n\n0.43 -0.34 \n\n \n\n0.79 0.67 \n\n0.2 4.9 12.3 \n\n \n\n0.16 -0.58 \n\n \n\n0.77 0.66 \n\n0.3 5.9 14.3 \n\n \n\n-0.24 -1.13 \n\n \n\n0.71 0.62 \n\n0.4 6.4 15.7 \n\n \n\n-0.44 -1.56 \n\n \n\n0.69 0.59 \n\n0.5 5.8 14.1 \n\n \n\n-0.24 -1.06 \n\n \n\n0.71 0.63 \n\n0.6 4.4 10.5 \n\n \n\n-0.44 -0.14 \n\n \n\n0.69 0.72 \n\n0.7 5.8 9.2 \n\n \n\n0.46 0.13 \n\n \n\n0.81 0.76 \n\n0.8 3.7 8.3 \n\n \n\n0.51 0.29 \n\n \n\n0.82 0.78 \n\n0.9 3.8 7.7 \n\n \n\n0.50 0.39 \n\n \n\n0.81 0.79 \n\n1.0 3.9 7.3 \n\n \n\n0.46 0.45 \n\n \n\n0.80 0.80 \n\n1.1 6.0 17.7 \n\n \n\n-0.25 -2.22 \n\n \n\n0.70 0.54 \n\n1.2 7.2 22.4 \n\n \n\n-0.83 -4.19 \n\n \n\n0.65 0.47 \n\n1.3 7.6 23.3 \n\n \n\n-1.02 -4.64 \n\n \n\n0.64 0.46 \n\n1.4 7.6 23.4 \n\n \n\n-1.02 -4.64 \n\n \n\n0.64 0.46 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.4 Scenarios of N doses (Part 1) \n\n \n\nSimulated annual N plant uptake was compared with experimental N amount in the \n\nwhole plant from Bruno et al.

(2005). \n\nFor the 200 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n scenario, however, simulated average N uptake was lower than \n\nobserved values and without the error interval. This discrepancy between model prediction \n\nand observation for M200 is possibly explained by other mechanisms for nutrient absorption \n\nnot accounted for by ANIMO. Before the experiment, the coffee plants used for this study \n\nwere grown for seven years under a high N management (600 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n). Plants were \n\ntherefore used to high amounts of fertilizer and one year receiving lower doses would not be \n\nenough to change their habit. Thus, plants should stimulate mechanisms for continuing at high \n\nuptake rates. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Simulated and observed cumulative N plant uptake for scenarios M200, M400, M600 and \n\nM800 during 2008/2009. The dotted line represents the expected N uptake by plants (Up) used for \n\nsimulations with all scenarios \n\n \n\n \n\nThe total N taken up by plants in ANIMO simulations can be divided into NO3-N or \n\nNH4-N preferences, and also in relation to the main region of nutrient absorption in the soil. \n\nFor the M200 scenario, uptake was 41% NO3-N and 59% NH4-N. For the M400, M600 and M800 \n\nscenarios, NO3-N uptake was predominant (52, 63 and 86% respectively). The highest plant \n\npreference for NO3-N occurred precisely for the highest dose of N (800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n). The \n\nhigh amount of N expected to be taken up by plants (Up) caused the plant to take up both \n\nforms of N when the nutrient was available in relatively low doses, but preferentially NO3 \n\nwhen supply was ample. In relation to distribution over depth, the first 0.1 m of soil provided \n\n39% (M200), 36% (M400), 32% (M600) and 28% (M800) of the total NO3-N, and 49% (M200), 46 \n\n% (M400), 42% (M600) and 29% (M800) of the total NH4-N. The surface layer was the main \n\npool of N for plants in this system when the fertilizer doses were less than 600 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. \n\nFor the N dose of 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n, the N uptake was mostly of NO3-N and absorbed from \n\nthe depths between 0.1 and 1.0 m.  \n\nTable 3.16 presents the annual inputs of inorganic N, conversions of NH4-N by \n\nnitrification, and losses by leaching, volatilization, and denitrification down to 1.0 m depth.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n \n\nThe annual NH4-N input due to the mineralization of organic substances in the system \n\nwas 130 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n was accounted in total inorganic input.

The poultry manure application (2500 kg ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1\n\n) improved the NH4-N \n\nformation by 29 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n and coffee husks (3000 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n) were responsible only for \n\n1.9 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n of NH4-N added to the system.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.16 \u2013 Predictions of nitrogen processes below a coffee plantation for different fertilizer \n\nmanagements \n\nInput (kg ha\n-1\n\n) \n NH4-N ?

In increasing order of \n\nN-dose, the fractions of NH4-N leached in relation to N input were 2.4%, 2.0%, 2.4%, and \n\n2.2%. Simulated NO3-N leaching was compared to experimental results obtained by \n\nBortolotto et al. (2013) for the same experimental coffee growing area. Their results for NO3-\n\nN leaching were 24.2 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (at 400 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n) and 153 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (at \n\n800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n), corresponding to 42% (M400) and 74% (M800) of the ANIMO simulated \n\nvalues. An exact agreement between the results of both models, however, was not expected, \n\ndue to the differences in the hydrological cycle simulated by SWAP (PINTO et al., 2015) and \n\nusing a sequential water balance as in Bortolotto et al. (2013). In addition, we used ANIMO \n\nto simulate the cumulative N leaching amount for a one year period, differently from the cited \n\nstudy with results obtained during a nine-month period.  \n\nThe ANIMO prediction of annual NO3-N leaching expressed per millimeter of rainfall \n\nand irrigation was 26 g ha\n-1\n\n mm\n-1\n\n for M400, which is comparable to values found in other \n\nstudies. Cannavo et al. (2013) obtained a NO3-N leaching of 59 g ha\n-1\n\n per millimeter of \n\nrainfall at the 1.2 m depth in a study with unshaded coffee plants fertilized with 250 kg N ha\n-1\n\n \n\ny\n-1\n\n. Harmand et al. (2007) determined a NO3-N leaching of 43 g ha\n-1\n\n per millimeter of rainfall \n\nin coffee plants fertilized with 180 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. Considering NO3-N leaching depends on soil \n\nproperties, plant, and nutrient management, values will vary from one location to another. \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nHowever, the simulated amounts of NO3-N leaching in the studied coffee plantation of \n\nwestern Bahia were compatible to the other cultivation areas.  \n\nThe temporal variation of NO3-N in the soil profile, coupled to precipitation, \n\nirrigation, fertigation (M400) and manure events, is presented in Figure 3.3. In the dry period \n\nof the year, due to the fertilizer applications and low soil moisture, the NO3-N was highly \n\nconcentrated in soil layer between surface and 0.3m depth. Water from isolated rain events \n\nincreased the leaching amount during the dry period and NO3-N concentration decreased in \n\nthe soil surface layer. During the wet period NO3-N concentration in soil solution of deeper \n\nlayers increased. At the end of the simulated period, with fewer rain events, the NO3-N \n\nconcentration in the soil surface increased, as well as in the soil profile below 0.6 m. The N \n\nleaching due to fertigation can be identified in the contour graph of Figure 3.3 (M400) and \n\nFigure 3.4 (M800). Due to the characteristics of the sandy soil, irrigation and peak rain events, \n\nthe NO3-N accumulated below the layer with the highest root concentration from 0-0.6 m \n\ndepth at the end of the year. A large difference exists in NO3-N soil concentration of Figure \n\n3.3 compared to Figure 3.4 due to the amount of N applied in the managements. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Timeline of rainfall (a), irrigation, and farm input events (b), and NO3-N concentration in \n\nthe soil profile (c) as a function of time for the scenario M400.

The lower boundary of the layer with \n\nhighest root concentration (DHRC) is indicated by the dotted line \n\n \n\nThe existence of NH4-N leaching in this coffee plantation is an important fact \n\nassociated with the modeling/validation. Bortolotto et al. (2013) considered the NO3-N \n\nleaching in this same area as being the total N leaching since they did not detect NH4-N \n\nconcentrations in their soil solution samples. However, for all studied scenarios, NH4-N was \n\npredicted to be present in detectable concentrations (> 25 \u00b5g L\n-1\n\n) in the soil solution and to be \n\ntransported by drainage (Table 3.16). Therefore, we simulated the effect of increased rates of \n\nnitrification and volatilization on NH4 present in the soil. When the nitrification rate knr was \n\nincreased to the highest value allowed by ANIMO (500 y\n-1\n\n), the NH4-N leaching was still \n\npresent (8.6 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n for M400). At the same time, increasing the nitrification rate affected \n\nmodeling accuracy at 1.0 m depth (d = 0.79 and NSE = 0.41). In a next scenario, the \n\nvolatilization of NH3 was increased to 50% of applications during dry periods, resulting in a \n\nNH4-N leaching of 9.8 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n in M400 (d = 0.80 and NSE = 0.35 for NO3-N concentration \n\nprediction at 1.0 m depth). These results showed NH4-N leaching is predicted even under very \n\nhigh levels of nitrification and volatilization. The undetected traces of NH4-N in soil samples \n\ncan be a result of nitrification along the period of time between field sampling and laboratory \n\nanalysis, since there was a considerable distance between both locations.  \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nWe suggest NH4-N can be found in the soil solution or leachate in the experimental site as \n\nshown by simulations. \n\nEmissions of N2O simulated by ANIMO resulted to be relatively high (table 3.16) \n\nwhen compared to results on cultivated or native Cerrado (METAY et al., 2007; CRUVINEL \n\net al., 2007; CARVALHO et al., 2006). Denitrification is present generally in flooded terrains \n\nor due to the presence of anoxic microsites, common in well-drained soils under high-\n\nintensity irrigation like in the present study. Moreover, when the litter cover is predominant, \n\nsoil moisture is conserved and the provision of C increased, contributing to the intensification \n\nof denitrification. Soils under irrigated coffee cultivation are prone to denitrification, although \n\nthis may not be the main N loss process in this system.  \n\nFor all scenarios, prediction of volatilization was low compared to the N inputs (Table \n\n3.16). During the simulations, only 37% of the fertilizer application events had the highest \n\nlosses of NH4-N considered by volatilization (10% of N in each application). The low rates of \n\nvolatilization during the year are partly justified since coffee plants received the urea in \n\nsolution by fertigation and most of these events (63%) were followed by irrigation or rainfall, \n\nprocesses which minimize losses of N by volatilization (JANTALIA et al., 2012; HOLCOMB \n\net al., 2011). Nevertheless, as the volatilization simulations could not be validated \n\nexperimentally, the obtained values of NH4-N losses by this process are uncertain and results \n\ncould diverge from experimental measurements. For that reason, we simulated the N balance \n\nwith ANIMO considering 1% of N input was volatilized from fertilizer when rain/irrigation \n\nhappened on the same day of application, 10% when the rain/irrigation happened on the next \n\nday of fertilizer application, and 30% when fertilizer application was not followed by \n\nrain/irrigation events, or during the dry period of the year. When the cited volatilization \n\npercentages were considered, the simulated annual losses of N by volatilization resulted 20.0 \n\nkg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (200 kg\n-1\n\n N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n), 50.0 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1 \n\n(400 kg\n-1\n\n N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n), 60.0 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (600 kg\n-1\n\n \n\nN ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n), and 80.0 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1 \n\n(800 kg\n-1\n\n N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n). When the volatilization percentages were \n\nincreased the values of N balance components did not chance significantly and NO3-N \n\nconcentrations in soil solution 1m depth simulated with ANIMO could be validated, although \n\nstatistical indexes values (d = 0.78, NSE = 0.33) decreased in relation to those in table 3.15. \n\nWe consider the results of annual volatilization obtained from the cited volatilization \n\npercentages 1%, 10% and 30% of N doses are the upper limits for our study area, since the \n\nstatistical indexes values d and NSE indicated a low quality of simulations when these \n\npercentages were higher.  We conclude that, for the conditions described in this study, the \n\namounts of volatilization between 7.0 and 20.0 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (200 kg\n-1\n\n N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n), 15.0 and 50.0 \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\n \n\nkg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (400 kg\n-1\n\n N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n), 21.0 and 60.0 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (600 kg\n-1\n\n N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n), and 28.0 and \n\n80.0 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (800 kg\n-1\n\n N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n) are representative of the studied coffee cultivation area. \n\nAs volatilization, denitrification and NH4-N leaching were not measured \n\nexperimentally, the validation of model predictions for these processes, unfortunately, could \n\nnot be performed. Steenvoorden et al. (1997) stated this is a problem for model performance \n\nevaluation, since nitrate leaching or NO3-N concentration can be calculated precisely and \n\nconfirmed by validation for different values or combinations of amounts of volatilization, \n\ndenitrification, and mineralization. Field measurements are highly recommended then to \n\nconfirm the rates of the simulated processes (Table 3.16) with ANIMO for this coffee \n\ncultivation system. \n\nAs presented here, the model ANIMO was calibrated and validated with the \n\nexperimental results obtained in a coffee plantation during one year. With these previous \n\nresults and data assembled, the scenarios of fertilizer and crop management, as well as climate \n\nchange predictions, can be generated with the association SWAP/ANIMO. The obtained \n\nresults of simulated N processes can serve as support for other studies and perhaps be useful \n\nin guiding research towards the most important topics on this N cycle that is still waiting to be \n\nbetter evaluated and estimated experimentally. \n\n \n\n3.3.5 Scenarios of N dose partition (Part 2) \n\n \n\nFigures 3.4 and 3.5 show the results of N efficiency uptake (NUpE) and NO3-N \n\nleaching, respectively, obtained from simulations of scenarios with different N application \n\nfrequencies and N doses.  \n\nThe NUpE descreased approximately in the same proportion that the N dose increased \n\nfor all the scenarios of N application frequency (Figures 3.4). For each of the selected \n\nscenarios of N application frequency, the reduced proportion in NUpE when dose increased \n\nfrom 200 to 300 kg N ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1 \n\nwas higher than NUpE decrease when dose increased from 300 \n\nto 400 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n or in any other case. For a selected N dose, differences in NUpE values \n\nwere not significant between fertilizer application frequency scenarios simulated with \n\nANIMO (Figure 3.4). \n\nFor each scenario of N application frequency, increases in N dose significantly \n\nincreased NO3-N leaching (Figures 3.5). Reducing the frequency of N application to less than \n\nonce each 14 days (NA1/2w) to seven or three times during the year showed to increase the \n\nNO3-N leaching when comparing results of the same N dose. For each evaluated N dose, there \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nwere almost no differences in the results of NO3-N leaching obtained from the scenarios of N \n\napplication NA1/2d, NA1/1w, and NA1/2w (Figure 3.5). The lowest value of NO3-N leaching \n\nresulted from the simulation of the scenario with 200 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n applied every second day \n\n(NA1/2d). \n\nWe consider an efficient N management should provide at least 50% of NUpE and \n\nNO3-N leaching less than 15% of the total N dose. Evaluations of NUpE and NO3-N leaching \n\nvalues resulted from the scenarios of N application frequency and N doses simulated with \n\nANIMO suggested the efficient managements are those with dose partition at least once every \n\n14 days and N doses equal or less than 300 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. \n\n  \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Nitrogen efficiency uptake (NUpE) values for different N application frequencies and \n\nyearly N doses. i) every second day (NA1/2d) ; ii) once a week (NA1/1w); iii) each 14 days (NA1/2w); iv) \n\nonce a month (NA1/1m); v) seven times during the year (NA7/12m); and vi) three times during one year \n\n(NA3/12m) \n\n60 \n50 \n\n44 40 \n36 \n\n31 27 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nN\nU\n\np\nE\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\ni) NA1/2d \n\n60 \n50 \n\n44 40 \n36 \n\n31 27 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nii) NA1/1w \n\n60 \n50 \n\n43 40 36 \n31 27 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nN\nU\n\np\nE\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\niii) NA1/2w \n\n60 \n50 \n\n43 40 \n36 \n\n31 27 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\niv) NA1/1m \n\n59 \n\n47 \n38 \n\n32 \n28 24 21 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nN\nU\n\np\nE\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nYearly N doses (kg ha-1) \n\nv) NA7/12m \n\n58 \n48 \n\n42 \n38 34 \n\n30 26 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nYearly N doses (kg ha-1) \n\nvi) NA3/12m \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Leaching of NO3-N values for different N application frequencies and yearly N doses. i) \n\nevery second day (NA1/2d) ; ii) once a week (NA1/1w); iii) each 14 days (NA1/2w); iv) once a month \n\n(NA1/1m); v) seven times during the year (NA7/12m); and vi) three times during one year (NA3/12m) \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n10 \n40 \n\n57 \n77 \n\n108 \n\n154 \n\n205 \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nN\n-N\n\nO\n3\n l\n\ne\na\n\nc\nh\n\nin\ng\n\n (\nk\n\ng\n h\n\na\n-1\n\n) i) NA1/2d \n\n28 40 \n58 \n\n79 \n112 \n\n161 \n\n213 \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nii) NA1/1w \n\n30 40 \n57 \n\n77 \n110 \n\n155 \n\n206 \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nN\n-N\n\nO\n3\n l\n\ne\na\n\nc\nh\n\nin\ng\n\n (\nk\n\ng\n h\n\na\n-1\n\n) \n\niii) NA1/2w \n\n31 46 \n65 \n\n88 \n120 \n\n166 \n\n215 \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\niv) NA1/1m \n\n34 48 \n70 \n\n96 \n137 \n\n185 \n\n238 \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nN\n-N\n\nO\n3\n l\n\ne\na\n\nc\nh\n\nin\ng\n\n (\nk\n\ng\n h\n\na\n-1\n\n) \n\nYearly N doses (kg ha-1) \n\nv) NA7/12m \n\n47 \n75 \n\n107 \n148 \n\n200 \n\n259 \n\n320 \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nYearly N doses (kg ha-1) \n\nvi) NA3/12m \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n \n\n3.3.6 Scenarios of precipitation amount (Part 3) \n\n \n\nFigures 3.6 and 3.7, respectively, show the results of N efficiency uptake (NUpE) and \n\nNO3-N leaching obtained from the simulations of scenarios with different amounts of \n\nprecipitation and N doses applied in the same frequency during the year (each 14 days). \n\nVariations in annual precipitation did not influence plant NUpE obtained from the \n\nsimulations of scenarios with ANIMO (Figure 3.6). For the same N dose, results of NUpE \n\nobtained from the scenario Pdefaut compared to other scenarios with increased or reduced \n\nprecipitation amount did not differ significantly. \n\nLeaching of NO3-N was very influenced by the variations in the cumulative amount of \n\nprecipitation (Figure 3.7).

Comparing values of NO3-N leaching resulted from the \n\nscenario with the average annual precipitation of Barreiras (AP03-13) with the scenario of the \n\nhistorical annual maximum precipitation (MaP30), the precipitation increase between these \n\nscenarios were responsible for 63% and 67% of NO3-N leaching increase for the N doses 300 \n\nand 600 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n, respectively.

Since fertilizer prices in Brazil diverge between regions, can also vary \n\naccordingly to the U$/R$ rate, we used the urea prices obtained by different studies in the \n\nperiod of 2014/2015. The urea (raw material, 45% N) prices were the following: i) average of \n\nR$ 1,537.00/t from Jully to September 2015, according to \u201cFedera\u00e7\u00e3o de Agricultura e \n\nPecu\u00e1ria de Goi\u00e1s \u2013 FAEG\u201d (FAEG, 2015); ii) between R$ 1,042.52/t and R$ 1,404.29/t in \n\nSeptember 2015, according to ARGUS (ARGUS, 2015); iii) average of R$ 1,353.50/t in \n\nApril/March 2015, according to \u201cCentro de Estudos Avan\u00e7ados em Economia Aplicada\u201d \n\n(CEPEA, 2015); iv) and average of R$ 800.00/t in the period of 2014-2015, according to \n\nWorld Bank data (WORLD BANK, 2015). The average price of urea obtained from cited data \n\nwas R$ 1,227.00/t (or R$ 1.23/kg), which was converted to kilograms of N resulting in R$ \n\n2.73/kg N. Figure 3.9 presents the scenarios of average costs by employing the N doses of \n\n200, 300, 400 kg ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1 \n\nand farmers dose of 600 kg ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1 \n\n(in 2008/2009) with urea prices of \n\n2014/2015. A pivot circle managed with high doses of N fertilizer demands high investments, \n\nby which a large quantity is wasted due to the N losses. Based on simulations of fertilizer \n\nplant uptake (39% of total plant uptake), total N leaching and losses by volatilization and \n\ndenitrification with ANIMO model, the costs with fertilizer for the coffee cultivation in \n\nCerrado would be significantly reduced by employing N doses between 200 and 300 kg ha\n-1\n\ny\n-\n\n1\n. These outcomes showed the average economic savings that farmers would have reducing \n\nthe amounts of fertilizer applications. \n\n \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 - Average annual expenses (R$) with fertilizers, coffee plant uptake and N losses in a pivot circle (100 ha) associated to the fertilizer doses \n\n(200, 300, 400 and 600 kg ha\n-1 \n\ny\n-1\n\n).

The \n\nmodel ANIMO was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis and the most important parameters for \n\nthe intensively fertilized system were obtained. For a soil-plant system like this, in which no \n\nother source of N besides urea is significant, emphasis should be given to soil pH and soil \n\ntemperature of reference (Tref). These parameters were especially sensitive for the simulations \n\nof the annual N balances when mineral fertilizer was applied at the rate of 400 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n \n\nand 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. The soil pH was the most sensitive modeling parameter. A 1% increase \n\nof pH made NO3-N leaching increase almost 3% for both M400 and M800. Although the \n\ndetailed processes simulated by ANIMO require several input parameters, in the evaluated \n\nscenarios not all of them were sensitive for modeling. The modeling with ANIMO can be \n\nsimpler and more objective when the most sensitive parameters are established. For instance, \n\nfor an agricultural system managed only with organic manures, the N concentration in the \n\norganic fractions of materials (cNfp and cNsp) and the decomposition rate constants (kfp and ksp) \n\nbecome the most important parameters to be characterized for use in ANIMO. The cited \n\nparameters soil pH and Tref should be taken into account anyway and be well adjusted \n\nindependently of the study conditions.  \n\nSome ANIMO parameters were taken from literature and can be seen as potential \n\nsources for new investigations. Future studies should consider, for instance, the maximum \n\ntranspiration stream concentration factor ?N\nmax\n\n that is frequently adopted as a unique value \n\nindependently of the soil-plant system. A description of ?N\nmax\n\n behavior for ordinary crops \n\nwould be welcome for ANIMO applications in systems with limited soil nitrogen availability. \n\nSome parameters of material characterization like the decomposition rate constant (k) are \n\ndifficult to find, and for that reason we summarize important information related to poultry \n\nmanure and coffee husks. With this information, we expect to benefit other investigations \n\nrelated to coffee cultivation. \n\nThis study also showed the N processes simulated by ANIMO have a distinct \n\nsensitivity behavior to the input parameters of soil, plant, and materials depending on the \n\nannual N dose. Plant uptake, leaching of NO3-N and NH4-N, and nitrification were affected \n\ndifferently by the same parameters in M400 and M800 and sometimes were sensitive to a certain \n\nparameter only for a specific N dose. These results challenged our purposes of using ANIMO \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nfor studying the N cycle processes establishing a unique set of parameters representative of \n\nthe system under several N dose scenarios.  \n\nThe model ANIMO was calibrated and validated for the coffee plantation of Cerrado \n\nand simulations were evaluated employing the statistical parameters RMSE, NSE and d index. \n\nThe model accurately predicted the majority of daily NO3-N concentrations in soil solution at \n\n1.0 m depth during validation, resulting RMSE = 7.3?10\n-3\n\n kg m\n-3\n\n, NSE = 0.45 and index d = \n\n0.80. The simulated annual N plant uptake values for doses of 400 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (calibration) \n\nand 800 kg N ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n (validation) were similar to the average values obtained by field \n\nexperiments. We conclude that the one-dimensional process-based model ANIMO was able to \n\ndescribe satisfactorily the average N cycle of the evaluated soil-plant system.  \n\nFrom the presented outcomes, we are encouraged to propose improvements for the \n\nmodel ANIMO that could make simulations more realistic or better describing fertigated \n\nagricultural systems. Firstly, the inorganic fertilizer characterization should be better \n\ndescribed to simulate the soil chemical reactions of nitrogen fertilizers. The upper boundary \n\nconditions could be enhanced as well, considering the detailed input of mineral nitrogen by \n\nirrigation (fertigation) as an option in the management file of ANIMO. The inclusion of other \n\nprocess occurring in the above ground system, e.g. N leaf interception, would be desirable in \n\nthis case. Secondly, ANIMO\u2019s simple consideration of the soil pH as time independent can be \n\ndeterminant under such conditions. Because soil pH can be affected by fertilizer input and \n\nsubsequently influence another process like nitrification, we consider including the soil pH \n\ntime variability as a model parameter would benefit model performance. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nALC\u00c2NTARA, F.A.; BUURMAN P.; FURTINI NETO A.E.; CURI, N.; ROSCOE R. \n\nConversion of grassy Cerrado into riparian forest and its impact on soil organic matter \n\ndynamics in an Oxisol from southeast Brazil.

CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\n \n\nThe hypotheses and objectives of this work were presented in section 1. In section 2 \n\nthe study \u201cDeep drainage modeling for a fertigated coffee plantation in the Brazilian Cerrado\u201d \n\nshowed the results of SWAP calibration and comparison of water balance outcomes with a \n\nconventional model, the Climatologic Water Balance. The sensitivity of water balance components to \n\ninput parameters of soil and plant were obtained, and the potential of SWAP for generating scenarios \n\nof irrigation was evaluated.  \n\nDrainage simulated by SWAP showed to be highly sensitive to the van Genuchten equation \n\nparameter n and Mualem equation parameter ?, and by plant crop factor Kc.  \n\nResults of annual water balance simulated by SWAP and calculated by CWB were equal, but \n\nthese models showed to predict differently monthly drainage. SWAP is a robust model, which was \n\nalso validated in several studies and conditions. We expect the drainage results obtained from this \n\nprocess-based model to be more realistic than the CWB, which is simpler in its formulation. \n\nIrrigation scenarios simulated with SWAP for the experimental year showed to be \n\nefficient in water use and coffee productivity when longer intervals of irrigation were used. \n\nAccording to this analysis, adopting an irrigation interval of 15 days and yearly water amount \n\nbetween 650 and 750 mm could be an option for better management compared to the farmer\u2019s \n\nscenario.  Results of water productivity, plant productivity, and deep drainage indicated the \n\nfarmer\u2019s management practices could be improved, minimizing loss of water by drainage and \n\nat the same time increasing coffee production.  \n\nIn section 3 the study \u201cModeling nitrogen dynamics in a fertigated coffee plantation in the \n\nBrazilian cerrado with ANIMO\u201d showed the simulations results of N dynamics due to natural entries \n\nand fertigation management in the studied coffee cultivation of Cerrado. The combinations of models \n\nSWAP/ANIMO was calibrated and validated with data of NO3-N concentrations in soil solution \n\nobtained experimentally. The sensitivity of N processes simulated with ANIMO to the input \n\nparameters was evaluated. The potential of SWAP/ANIMO for generating scenarios of N fertilizer \n\napplication were evaluated in this section. \n\nANIMO was calibrated and validated for the coffee plantation of Cerrado and \n\nsimulations were evaluated employing the statistical parameters RMSE, NSE and d index. \n\nThe model accurately predicted the majority of daily NO3-N concentrations in soil solution at \n\nthe 1.0 m depth during validation, which was confirmed by the obtained ranking of statistical \n\nindex values. The simulated annual N plant uptake was close and within the uncertainty \n\ninterval of the experimental value available in the validation scenario. Evaluations of NUpE \n\nand NO3-N leaching results from the scenarios of N application frequency and N doses \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nsimulated with ANIMO suggested the most efficient managements are those with dose \n\npartition at least once every 14 days and N doses equal or less than 300 kg ha\n-1\n\n y\n-1\n\n. \n\nWe conclude that the combination of one-dimensional process-based models \n\nSWAP/ANIMO was able to describe satisfactorily the average N cycle of the evaluated soil-\n\nplant system of Cerrado in Bahia, Brazil. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEX \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAgricultural Water Management 148 (2015) 130\u2013140\n\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\n\nAgricultural  Water  Management\n\nj o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / a g w a t\n\nDeep  drainage  modeling  for  a  fertigated  coffee  plantation  in  the\n\nBrazilian  savanna\n\nVictor  Meriguetti  Pinto a,?,  Klaus  Reichardt a, Jos van Dam c, Quirijn  de Jong  van  Lier a,\nIsabeli  Pereira  Bruno d, Angelica  Durigon a, Durval  Dourado-Neto b,\nRafael  Pivotto  Bortolotto e\n\na Soil Physics Laboratory, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture, PO Box 96, 13416-970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil\nb Department of Crop Science, University of  S\u00e3o Paulo, \u201cLuiz de Queiroz\u201d College of Agriculture, PO Box 9, 134180-970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil\nc Department of Environmental Sciences, Wageningen University and Research Centre, PO Box 47, 6700 AA Wageningen, The Netherlands\nd Agronomic Institute of Paran\u00e1, IAPAR, Rodovia Celso Garcia Cid, km 375, Londrina 86047-902, PR, Brazil\ne Soil Division, Federal University of Santa Maria, Av.

Among  the\n\nexisting  computational models to describe hydrological  processes, SWAP  (Soil,  Water,  Atmosphere and\n\nPlant  model)  has  been  successfully  used  under  several conditions.  This model  was originally  developed  to\n\nsimulate  short  cycle crops and  its use  also  to cover  longer cycles,  e.g.  perennial crops,  is a  new application.\n\nThis  report shows  a SWAP  application  to a  mature  coffee crop  over one-production  cycle,  focusing on\n\ndeep  drainage  losses  in a  typical  soil\u2013plant\u2013atmosphere  system of the  Brazilian  savanna  (Cerrado).  The\n\nestimated  annual  deep drainage  Q =  1019  mm obtained  by SWAP was within  99% of the  value  determined\n\nby  the  climatologic  water balance  of 1010 mm. Monthly  results of SWAP  for  Q  compared  to  the  estimative\n\nusing  the  climatological  method  presented a determination  coefficient of 0.77.  A  variety of coffee  ferti-\n\ngation  scenarios  were simulated  using  SWAP  and  compared  to farmer\u2019s management  scenario,  leading\n\nto  the  conclusion that  larger  irrigation  intervals  result  in lower Q  losses,  better  water productivity  and\n\nhigher  crop  yield.\n\n\u00a9 2014  Elsevier  B.V.

The savanna domain in Bahia is  highly suit-\n\nable for irrigated agriculture due to the great availability of surface\n\nand underground water resources. According to Brazil\u2019s National\n\nGrain Supply Company (CONAB), western Bahia is an important\n\nfood (grain) provider and holds, for example, the highest coffee\n\nyield under savanna conditions in the country. However, there are\n\nsome concerns in respect to the modern agriculture practiced in\n\nthis producer region. Due to the ineffective land management dur-\n\ning the last decades, the irrigated farms concentrated at specific\n\nareas and, therefore, conflicts over water use already took place\n\nin western Bahia (Lima, 2011). At the same time, management\n\n? Corresponding author. Tel.: +55 19  34294617.\n\nE-mail address: meriguett@hotmail.com (V.M. Pinto).\n\npractices applied by farmers are not sustainable in terms of fertil-\n\nizer and water usage, especially due to  the lack of scientific studies\n\nthat support their decisions (Bruno et al., 2011).\n\nNumerical modeling applied to  agriculture is a useful tool to\n\nsimulate biophysical processes and can be used to obtain short-\n\nterm results and future predictions under defined scenarios. The\n\ninformation generated is helpful for establishing a  more sustainable\n\nagriculture as well as supporting strategies for the mitigation of\n\npollution, named by Strauch et al. (2013) as the \u201cBest Management\n\nPractices\u201d. The hydrological model SWAP (Soil, Water, Atmosphere\n\nand Plant) is one of the existing algorithms used worldwide for a\n\nvariety of soils, crops and climatic conditions (Chirico et al., 2013;\n\nCrescimanno et al., 2012; Eitzinger et al., 2004; Kamble et al., 2013;\n\nMa et al., 2011; Noory et al., 2011). The model has shown consis-\n\ntent results when applied to maize crops in  sub-tropical climates\n\n(Pinheiro et al., 2013) and to soybeans and common beans in  tropi-\n\ncal climates (Scorza Junior et al., 2010; Durigon et al., 2012). SWAP\n\nwas successfully validated already under several climatic and envi-\n\nronmental conditions as cited Ines et al. (2006).
