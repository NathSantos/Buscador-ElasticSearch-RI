Firstly there is a need to provide a robust, optical quality host \n\nin which to incorporate the biomolecule. In principle the host matrix should be \u201cinert\u201d \n\n(with minimum interaction with the guest enzyme), protective and should retain the \n\nenzyme within its structure, allowing maximum catalytic activity and free passage of \n\nthe reactants both to and from the enzyme. Materials which are promising in this respect \n\nare silica glasses made via the sol-gel technique. They are optically transparent, have a \n\nhigh porosity and they template around the biomolecule providing a protective host. \n\nHowever, the encapsulation process can have adverse effects; the loss of enzymatic \n\ncatalytic activity can happen and the mass transport through the host is not ideal! \n\nIn this work fluorescence techniques were used to monitor the incorporation of an \n\nenzyme into a sol-gel derived medium. Several additives were used in tuning the \n\noriginal sol-gel recipe to improve biocompatibility. Complementary measurements of \n\ncatalytic activity were performed to elucidate the behaviour of the encapsulated protein. \n\nMolecular diffusion was monitored using labelled proteins and unbound \n\nfluorescence dye molecules (representative of enzyme substrates) and their interaction \n\nwith and mobility within the host assessed using time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy \n\nand fluorescence recovery after photobleaching observed via confocal microscopy. \n\nViscosity (DASPMI) and polarity (Nile red) sensitive fluorescence probes were \n\nemployed to monitor the host matrices. Nile red was also used to label two catalytic \n\nproteins (cytochrome c and subtilisin Carlsberg), which were incorporated into different \n\nhost media and the dye used to ascertain changes in protein conformation. \n\nOverall it was found that the hosts became stable after an aging period \n\napproaching twenty days and that the major influence on the catalytic reaction rates is \n\nthat of host mediated mass transport. \n\n vi\n\n\n\nFLUORESCENCE STUDY OF SOL-GEL DERIVED PROTEIN \n\nSILICA HYBRIDS FOR OPTICAL BIOSENSOR APPLICATIONS \n\n \nResumo \n\n \nA utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de enzimas para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de biosensores \u00f3pticos tem evidenciado \n\num not\u00e1vel desenvolvimento. Neste contexto, a tecnologia sol-gel, cuja versatilidade \u00e9 a \n\npalavra-chave do seu sucesso, tem demonstrado enormes potencialidades. A oclus\u00e3o de \n\nenzimas em matrizes de s\u00edlica pela t\u00e9cnica sol-gel permite a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de h\u00edbridos com \n\nboas qualidades \u00f3pticas e consider\u00e1vel robustez f\u00edsica. Para al\u00e9m disso, a sua porosidade \n\npermite a difus\u00e3o dos substratos enzim\u00e1ticos e produtos de reac\u00e7\u00e3o, com reten\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nenzima constituindo, simultaneamente, um meio protector contra agentes f\u00edsicos, \n\nqu\u00edmicos e biol\u00f3gicos. Contudo, o processo tem as suas fragilidades, nomeadamente a \n\nperda de actividade catal\u00edtica devido a desnatura\u00e7\u00e3o da enzima, e constrangimentos \n\nrelativamente ao livre-tr\u00e2nsito dos analitos.  \n\nNeste trabalho, foram utilizadas t\u00e9cnicas de fluoresc\u00eancia para seguir a \n\nincorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00ednas em matrizes de s\u00edlica pela t\u00e9cnica sol-gel. A receita original \n\nfoi adaptada, utilizando-se aditivos (silanos ou pol\u00edmeros) para melhorar a \n\nbiocompatibilidade dos h\u00edbridos. A difus\u00e3o molecular foi estudada usando prote\u00ednas \n\nmarcadas com sondas fluorescentes e fluor\u00f3foros livres, atrav\u00e9s das t\u00e9cnicas de \n\nanisotropia de fluoresc\u00eancia resolvida no tempo e recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de fluoresc\u00eancia ap\u00f3s \n\nfotobranqueamento, esta \u00faltima utilizando a microscopia confocal. A polaridade e a \n\nviscosidade das matrizes foram estudadas utilizando as sondas Nile red e DASPMI, \n\natrav\u00e9s da medi\u00e7\u00e3o de fluoresc\u00eancia no estado estacion\u00e1rio (fazendo uso da t\u00e9cnica de \n\nvarrimento s\u00edncrono de fluoresc\u00eancia), ou resolvida no tempo. A sonda Nile red, por ser \n\nhidrof\u00f3bica e solvatocr\u00f3mica, foi escolhida para marca\u00e7\u00e3o das prote\u00ednas e levar a cabo \n\nestudos de conforma\u00e7\u00e3o enzim\u00e1tica. Estudos complementares de actividade catal\u00edtica, \n\nforam realizados para caracterizar o comportamento do biocatalisador encapsulado. \n\nConcluiu-se que as matrizes produzidas utilizando o nosso m\u00e9todo, estabilizam ao fim \n\nde um per\u00edodo de aproximadamente 20 dias e que a taxa de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o substrato-\n\nproduto das prote\u00ednas estudadas, \u00e9 mais influenciada pelas restri\u00e7\u00f5es impostas pela \n\nmatriz ao livre-tr\u00e2nsito dos analitos, do que pela desnatura\u00e7\u00e3o das biomol\u00e9culas. \n\n vii\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nE pur si muove! \n\n(Galileo Galilei) \n\n viii\n\n\n\nCONTENTS \n\n \nChapter 1 Introduction 1 \n\n  \nChapter 2 The sol-gel method 13 \n\n2.1.

A biosensor is a device capable of providing selective quantitative \n\nor semi-quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element, by \n\nconverting a biochemical event into a detectable signal via a transducer and a processor. \n\nBiosensors are classified according to the transduction element (e.g., electrochemical, \n\noptical, piezoelectrical or thermal) or the biorecognition principle (e.g., enzymatic, \n\nimmunoaffinity recognition, whole-cell sensor or DNA). The purpose of the biological \n\nelement is to grant selectivity for the analyte of interest  [3-5]. \n\nAt present, commercial biosensors are still expensive and limited in the number of \n\ntargets they can test. The future developments of science and technology will permit the \n\nfabrication of optical biosensors useful as everyday analytical tools. In the opinion of \n\nLigler \u201cbiological recognition and signal amplification strategies, nanotechnology for \n\ngeometric control of the biochemistry and signal enhancement, microfluidics for \n\nautomated reagent delivery and reaction control, and emergence of optical elements \n\namenable to improved systems integration will play a critical role in this evolution\u201d [6]. \n\nThe four prerequisites of a competitive biosensor to function in a real-world sample \n\nsituation are undoubtedly selectivity, sensitivity, detection limits, and robustness. \n\nBiosensors have wide applications, including biomarker detection for medical \n\ndiagnostics, pathogen and toxin detection in food and environmental monitoring. Fibre-\n\n 1\n\n\n\noptic biosensors use optical fibres as the transduction element, and rely exclusively on \n\noptical transduction mechanisms for detecting target molecules [7,8]. \n\nThe development of biosensors based on nanostructured sol\u2013gel-derived platforms \n\nhas attracted increased attention in the last three decades and reports on the successful \n\nentrapment of biomolecules such as proteins, enzymes, antibodies or drugs are \n\nnumerous [9-14]. The term sol refers to a colloidal suspension of solid particles (the \n\ndisperse phase) in a liquid (the continuous phase) that, by condensation, form an \n\nirregular, non-crystalline, three-dimensional network that occupies the entire volume of \n\na vessel \u2013 the gel. The gel network is porous and is filled by an interstitial fluid. In \n\nhydrogels, the fluid phase is water or aqueous solution, in alcogels it is alcoholic \n\nsolution, and in aerogels it is air or other gases [15]. The term colloid was coined by \n\nThomas Graham in the 1860s, to classify substances such as gelatine, albumin and \n\ngums, which, in a solution, would not pass a dialysis membrane [16]. Common \n\nexamples of other types of colloidal dispersions are foam, mayonnaise, fog and mist, \n\nand the biological cell [17]. \n\nThe sol-gel technique is based on the hydrolysis of liquid precursors with the \n\nformation of colloidal sols and, after condensation, stable gels. Alkoxides, M(OR)z \n\n(where M z+ is a metal/semi-metal ion and R is an alkyl group), are the most widespread \n\nprecursors. Among these, silicon alkoxides are very popular, as the materials obtained \n\npossess good optical properties (transparency), satisfactory mechanical stability, high \n\nsurface area and porosity, chemical inertness as well as photochemical and thermal \n\nstability. Also, they can be obtained in a variety of formats depending on the mould. As \n\nthe early steps of the sol\u2013gel process occur in liquid phase, it is possible to add almost \n\nany substance at this stage, and a uniform distribution of the dopant is obtained merely \n\nby mixing. After the gelation, the guest molecules become entrapped within the solid \n\nhost matrix [18]. The sol-gel immobilisation of biological entities is characterised by \n\nphysical entrapment without any chemical modification of the biomolecule. The silica \n\nnanocage that forms around the dopant molecule protects it and preserves its \n\nfunctionality; the biochemical reaction is basically the same as in aqueous solution, \n\nexcept for the fact that it is generally slower, most probably because of mass transport \n\nlimitations [19]. \n\nThe potential applications of sol-gel technology are not restricted to sensing \n\ndevices, they also have been studied in the context of drug delivery, drug targeting, \n\ntissue engineering, gene transfection, and cell tracking [20-23]. Applications in the \n\n 2\n\n\n\nmedical field such as bone implant rely on the fact that sol-gel derived media are \n\nbiocompatible, bioactive and inert [24,25]. The enormous versatility of the sol-gel \n\nchemistry enables the production of robust hybrids at low temperatures with remarkable \n\nnew material properties that can be used to enhance the stability of a certain \n\nbiomolecule. Chemically engineered surfaces, modification by additives and alcohol-\n\nfree routes are some of the strategies that have been reported aiming to produce \n\namenable sol-gel hosts [8,26-30]. However, before commercialisation, problems \n\ninherent to the sol-gel process like stability, response time or repeatability have to be \n\nresolved [31].  \n\nThe sensor area has grown considerably through the design of sol\u2013gel materials \n\nwith enhanced biorecognition. A great effort has been made to understand short and \n\nlong-term interactions between the biorecognition elements and the evolving sol\u2013gel \n\nmatrix. These interactions are essential because they govern the function of the \n\nentrapped biomolecule [10,32,33]. Also, in the particular case of enzymes, ensuring that \n\nthe substrate and the products of reaction are not sterically hindered from diffusing to or \n\nfrom the active site, is fundamental [34,35]. Similarly, the local environment of the \n\nentrapped biomolecules and the ability of analytes to diffuse through the matrix are two \n\nbasic issues when developing sol\u2013gel-based biosensors [10]. \n\nThe fact that sol-gel hybrids can be transparent, therefore light addressable, \n\nenables the study of the embedded biomolecule via spectroscopic methods and the \n\napplication of the technology to optical biosensors. The investigation in this area is \n\nintense, ranging from simple one-enzyme devices to multi-enzyme systems [36-39]. \n\nFluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used to monitor the sol-gel process, the \n\nconformation/interactions of proteins in aqueous solution and to determine enzymatic \n\nactivity [40-47]. The use of fluorescence techniques to monitor sol-gel hybrid systems \n\nseems ideal as it can address both the host matrix and the guest biomolecule, and \n\nenables the visualisation of molecular diffusion down to single-molecule level [48]. \n\nMoreover, the use of fluorescent probes with different sensitivities allows the \n\ndiscrimination between diverse physical and chemical properties within these micro-\n\nheterogeneous systems. In fact, the information obtained by experiments depends on the \n\nattributes of the probe, therefore a careful scrutiny of the fluorophore must be done \n\nbefore setting up any experiment [49]. For example, the strong solvent-dependency of \n\nelectronic bands (solvatochromism) which is exhibited in particular by molecules \n\nhaving large dipole moments can be used to extract information about the solvent \n\n 3\n\n\n\npolarity, out of simple fluorescence measurements [50,51]. This property can further be \n\nexploited by synchronous fluorescence spectrometry (SFS), a technique that enables \n\nresolving the broad-band overlapping of conventional fluorescence spectra, which arise \n\nfrom their similar molecular structures. Like this, it is possible to discriminate a probe \n\nwithin several environments or, conversely, several compounds in a mixture [52]. \n\nThe advantages of fluorescence include extreme sensitivity, specificity, and the \n\nability to measure both intensity and lifetime. Time-resolved measurements give \n\nadditional information besides steady-state data and they are especially relevant to in \n\nvivo sensing because they can be chosen so that light scattering and concentration \n\neffects become negligible [53]. Supplementary information is given by time-dependant \n\nanisotropy measurements. From here it is possible to extract information on size, shape, \n\nflexibility and rotation of molecules, and also information about the properties of the \n\nmedium like viscosity [49]. The dynamics of a system can also be monitored by \n\nexploiting a phenomenon related to the properties of the fluorophores \u2013 photobleaching. \n\nAlthough in certain circumstances it can represent a drawback, it can also be an \n\nadvantage for studying the movements of molecules when combined with imaging \n\ntechniques.  Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was initially employed \n\nto study the dynamics of lipids and proteins in living cells but its applications have \n\nexpanded greatly with the development of confocal microscopy [54]. \n\n  \n\nThis thesis demonstrates how fluorescence can be successfully employed to \n\nmonitor the production of a sol-gel derived biosensor. Our investigation followed the \n\nbehaviour of biomolecules in the host, namely protein stability, mobility, and \n\nmicroenvironment characteristics, making use of both steady-state and time-resolved \n\nfluorescence techniques. Taking advantage of the flexibility of sol-gel chemistry, \n\noptimisation of the sol-gel \u201crecipe\u201d was made in order to make the hosts more amenable \n\nto the guest biomolecules. Protein-compatible monoliths were produced using the \n\npolymers polyethylene glycol (PEG 300 D and PEG 20 KD) and Gelrite\u00ae, to tune the \n\nresulting sol-gel composite dipolarity and pore templating, and thus control the flow of \n\nmaterials through the matrix [55-57]. The silanes (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane \n\n(APTES), trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS) or (glycidyloxypropyl)triethoxysilane \n\n(GPTES),  were added to prepare organically modified silica gels with differing \n\nhydrophobycities and, like that, promote the protein stability [58-61].  The proteins \n\nhorseradish peroxidise (HRP), bovine serum albumin (BSA), subtilisin Carlsberg and \n\n 4\n\n\n\ncytochrome c were encapsulated in inorganic and modified sol-gel derived media, \n\nacting as model systems of protein-doped sol-gel glasses, as their mechanistic behaviour \n\nis well documented in literature. Both HRP and cytochrome c are haem containing \n\nproteins and, although not strictly an enzyme, cytochrome c exhibits catalytic activity \n\nand was selected as it could be the forerunner for the inclusion of other cytochromes \n\nand even be part of the building blocks for incorporating an enzyme reaction chain \n\nwithin sol-gel derived media. \n\nThe host manufacturing process was observed making use of viscosity \n\n(DASPMI) and polarity (Nile red) sensitive fluorescent probes, by monitoring their \n\nemission via steady state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. In addition, \n\ncombining FRAP of FITC-labelled proteins of different sizes (HRP and BSA) in sol-gel \n\nmonoliths with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements (also using Alexa \n\nFluor 488), it was shown that lateral and rotational diffusion could be measured. Like \n\nthat, it was possible to relate the molecules\u2019 retention with the size and connectivity of \n\nthe pores in the sol-gel matrix. \n\n Nile red was also used to label two catalytically active proteins (cytochrome c \n\nand subtilisin Carlsberg), which were incorporated into the different host media. \n\nMotivated by the fact that Nile red\u2019s SFS was previously successfully used to ascertain \n\nthe probe\u2019s distribution between lipoproteins and albumin in blood [62], we used a \n\nsimilar approach to ascertain changes in protein conformation, both upon incorporation \n\nand throughout the sol-gel aging period. Catalytic activity measurements were \n\nperformed in order to correlate the fluorescence data with the embedded proteins\u2019 \n\nbiological activity. \n\nMeasurement of cytochrome c activity was obtained from the oxidation of 2,2-\n\nAzino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), by \n\nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The formation of the ABTS?+ radical cation was monitored \n\nat 414 nm with time, using absorption spectroscopy. A similar procedure was employed \n\nin the case of the subtilisin Carlsberg hybrid matrices. However, in this case, the \n\ncatalytic activity was monitored against a substrate of Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methyl \n\ncoumarin (AAF-AMC) and the product formation was monitored at 370 nm. This \n\nstrategy also allowed the influence of choice of substrate to be elucidated, as ABTS?+ \n\nradical is charged and can revert to its uncharged form. Conversely, AAF-AMC and the \n\nreaction product AMC (7-amido-4-methyl coumarin) are neutral and formed \n\nirreversibly. These complementary studies (Nile red SFS and catalytic activity) \n\n 5\n\n\n\nprovided an estimation of the influence of protein denaturing (and/or conformational \n\nchange) as well as host mediated effects (diffusional access) on the observed catalytic \n\nactivity. \n\nIn this work fluorescence is employed to monitor the fabrication of a sol-gel \n\nhybrid protein-containing silica-based biosensor. Although this thesis does not \n\nencompass the manufacture of a complete sensor (device), it addresses important \n\nfeatures of any biosensor system: how the biomolecule interacts with its host. \n\nTherefore, it is believed that the information obtained is relevant in advancing this field \n\nof study. \n\n \n\n \n\n 6\n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n[1] Ernest, H.

Introduction \n\n \nThe initial steps of the sol-gel science go back to the mid-1800, when M. Ebelman \n\nand T. J. Graham tried to manufacture inorganic ceramic and glass materials using \n\ntetraethylorthosilane (TEOS). However, to prevent silica gels to break into pieces, a \n\nlong drying period was required (up to one year!). This, of course, reduced the interest \n\non the method. For the next hundred years only academic chemists would give attention \n\nto the sol-gel process, gathering a reasonable amount of descriptive literature, but sparse \n\nunderstanding on the physical and chemical principles. Interest in the sol-gel process re-\n\nemerged given the great optimism towards its ability to manufacture glass components \n\nsuch as fibres, lenses and mirrors, by direct low-temperature production. Besides this \n\nvery important advantage, others commonly mentioned are the high homogeneity and \n\npurity of resulting materials and the possibility of greater control of the \u201cglass\u201d forming \n\nreaction. This allows the formation of materials of high porosity with a large internal \n\nsurface area [1,2]. The word \u201ctailor-made\u201d is often employed to address these special \n\nfeatures of the sol-gel process, and it is also the key to the success (present and future) \n\nof this technology. The recent revival of sol-gel method and the growing number of \n\nlaboratories investigating this field during the last few decades is related to the \n\nrequirement to produce new materials to be used in electronics, communication, energy, \n\nand other high technology fields [3-5]. In the 1990\u2019s Avnir and co-workers succeeded in \n\nencapsulate biomolecules within silica sol-gel matrices, inaugurating a new era in \n\n 13\n\n\n\nbiotechnology-related materials [6,7]. This achievement motivated several other groups \n\ntowards combining advanced materials with biology, producing applications in \n\nmedicine, environmental science, biotechnology, sensors and photonics [8-12]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. The sol-gel chemistry \n\n \nThe name sol refers to a suspension of solid (colloidal) particles ranging in size \n\nfrom 1 nm to 100 nm, in a liquid. The predominant interaction between these particles \n\noriginates from their surface charge and Van der Waals attractions. The sol comprises \n\nthe precursors, or initial components of the sol-gel reaction. The most common class \n\nare the silicon alkoxides, with tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS) and tetramethylorthosilane \n\n(TMOS) the most thoroughly studied. Some studies make use of TEOS as it is less toxic \n\nthan TMOS. Alkoxides readily react with water \u2013 hydrolysis and two partially \n\nhydrolysed molecules can bind to each other releasing an alcohol. This reaction is called \n\ncondensation, and if it continues, can form a long random branched polymeric \n\nmolecule. Consequently, the process by which it forms is called polymerisation. When \n\nthe molecule reaches macroscopic proportions and extends to the whole colloidal \n\nsolution, it is said to have achieved the gelation point, signalling the moment when the \n\nsystem consists of a combination of solid and fluid phases. The gel point is easy to \n\nobserve and measure qualitatively, but it is difficult to measure analytically, as it \n\ndepends on the temperature, solvent and pH [1,13,14]. \n\nMost alkoxides and water are not miscible leading to the use of a co-solvent \n\nsuch as ethanol. Both hydrolysis and condensation can happen under acidic or basic \n\nconditions. Acid catalysis favours a relatively slower rate of hydrolysis; the linear \n\npolymerisation produces long molecules that can entwine resulting in gelation. Base \n\ncatalysis favours a faster rate of hydrolysis giving rise to clusters of polymer chains, \n\nwhich behave as discrete species. Gelation occurs by linking of these clusters. With \n\nsilicon alkoxides the pH above which condensation becomes faster than hydrolysis is \n\naround three [15,16]. Figure 2.1 illustrates the hydrolysis and condensation reaction of \n\nTEOS precursor molecules in an acid catalysed reaction. \n\n 14\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSi OCH2CH3\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nCH3CH2O\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nSi OH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nH\n+\n\nOH2 HOC2H5\n\nHydrolysis\n\n+ 4 + 4\n\n \n \n\nSi OH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nSi O\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nSi OH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH2Si OH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\n+ +\n\nWater condensation\n\n \n\n \n\nHOC2H5OHSi\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nSi O\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nSi OCH2CH3\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nCH3CH2O\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nSi OCH2CH3\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nOCH2CH3\n\n+ +\n\nAlcohol condensation\n\n \n \n\nSi O\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nSi\n\nOH\n\nSi OH\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nO\n\nSi OOH\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nSi \u00d3HSi\n\nO\n\nSiOH\n\nOH\n\nO O\n\nOH\n\nSi OH\n\nOH\n\nSi\n\nO\n\nSilica matrix\n\n \n \nFigure 2.1. Hydrolysis and polycondensation of TEOS molecules (alkoxide precursor) in an acid \n\ncatalysed sol-gel reaction. The condensation reactions release water and ethanol into the solution as the \n\nSiO2 matrix forms. \n\n 15\n\n\n\nAfter gelation, the reaction continues, as the polymer network is flexible enough \n\nto move, allowing supplementary condensation. Also, there is still sol present inside the \n\npores. As a result, monomers or small polymers can bind to the network, producing \n\nfurther changes in its structure and properties. This process is termed aging and is the \n\nreason why the gel shrinks in the early stages subsequent to gelation. Further shrinkage \n\nduring the drying phase can occur, which involves the deformation of the network and \n\ntransport of liquid through the pores, part of which can evaporate. This forms a product \n\ncalled a xerogel. Additional processing to remove further residual solvent may be \n\nperformed and can result in a dense ceramic under conditions of an oxygen atmosphere \n\nand heat, or even  an aerogel if supercritical extraction (using CO2, for example) is \n\ndone. Aerogels are an interesting class of materials with exceedingly large porosities \n\n(up to 99%!) and good thermal insulation properties [13,17]. \n\n \n\nThe versatility of the sol-gel method enables the manufacture of materials with a \n\ngreat variety of forms (films, fibres, monoliths, and powders) as shown in figure 2.2. \n\nMoreover, it allows the incorporation of doping species (proteins, antibodies, drugs, \n\nparticles, dyes, etc) by addition to the sol prior to gelation (figure 2.3).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nFigure 2.2.

The sol-gel reaction with physical entrapment of a doping species. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe resultant materials can be chemically, photochemically and \n\nelectrochemically stable. In addition, their transparency (in the visible spectral region) \n\nallows their optical characterisation and application in optoelectronic devices [18-28]. \n\nThe combination of inorganic precursors with organoalkoxysilanes is very attractive in \n\nthe sense that the new material can exhibit unique chemical and physical properties, \n\nwhich can be tuned for a multiplicity of purposes. This is the field of \u201corganically \n\nmodified silicates\u201d \u2013 ORMOSILS with the general formula R-Si-(OR\u2019)3, where R \n\nrepresents the functionality and OR\u2019 represents the reactive alkoxide group [18]. The \n\norganic modification reduces the cross-linking during the polymerisation stage and \n\ndensification is attenuated through the creation of numerous and/or large pores within \n\nthe sol-gel network. Figure 2.4 depicts the organic modification of a silicon alkoxide \n\nand the ORMOSIL connectivity [17,18,29]. Hybrid materials can also be produced by \n\ninterpenetrating polymer networks and formation of two concurrent organic and \n\ninorganic phases (possibly chemically bonded to each other). For example, the mixture \n\nof a silica sol with a solution of a water soluble polymer, such as agar, can produce an \n\ninterpenetrating polymer network (or IPN) composite sol-gel matrix. Finally, organic \n\ncompounds can be simply trapped within the host matrix. Blending more than one \n\norganic phase has been extensively used, such as combination of biopolymers with \n\nsilica, for incorporation of biomolecules [30-36].  \n\n \n\n 17\n\n\n\nOrganic modification \n\nSi OCH2CH3\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nCH3CH2O\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nSi R\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nR\n\nOCH2CH3\n\nSi\nO\nSi\nO\n\nR\n\nOO\nO\n\nH\n+\n\nOH2 R\n+\n\nLimited densification \n \nNew chemical properties \n\nTEOS ORMOSIL (monomer) ORMOSIL  \n \n\nFigure 2.4.

The hydrolysis and \n\npolycondensation of this alkoxide precursor followed by aging under ambient \n\ntemperature and pressure results in a \u201csponge-like\u201d network of hydrated amorphous \n\nsilica, with pores ranging from 1 to 10nm in diameter [1]. As previously mentioned, as \n\nwater and silicon alkoxides are immiscible, a co-solvent (e.g. alcohol) is normally used. \n\nThe objective here is the incorporation of biomolecules and alcohol is well known to \n\ndeactivate them [15]. It is therefore important to limit the exposure of any biomolecule \n\nto ethanol. With this in mind, instead of using a co-solvent, sonication of the initial two-\n\nphase system was performed to promote mixing of the two phases. The release of \n\nalcohol as a by-product of the hydrolysis is sufficient to promote further \n\nhomogenisation [13]. The use of an acid catalysis was also preferred as the monoliths \n\nproduced possess excellent optical properties. This is obviously desirable if the material \n\nis intended for application as an optical addressable biosensor. To avoid any adverse \n\neffects caused by an acidic environment, the biomolecules were added to the sol in a \n\nsecond step, in a neutral buffered solution and the concentration of acid kept low \n\n(<0.01M). Finally, a set of ORMOSIL and IPN matrices were produced to encapsulate \n\nselected biomolecules. The silane modifiers were (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane \n\n(APTES), trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS) and (glycidyloxypropyl)triethoxysilane \n\n(GPTES). The chosen polymers were PEG 300 D, PEG 20 KD and Gelrite\u00ae. \n\n 18\n\n\n\n2.3. Protein-doped sol-gel systems \n\n \nThe mid-1950\u2019s witnessed the first successful entrapment of enzymes into silica \n\nsol-gel derived media, with partial retention of their catalytic activity. The importance \n\nof this achievement was not immediately grasped but, three decades later, Avnir and \n\nZink\u2019s research groups restarted investigation on the application of a biological moiety \n\ninto sol-gel derived media. In this framework, the central question is how to stabilise the \n\nbiological component in the artificial environment, while preserving its properties, \n\nactivity and function? Approaches used to immobilise biomolecules, like adsorption \n\nonto a surface and covalent attachment [37-39], can cause partial loss of activity \n\nbecause of steric hindrance as a result of the proximity between neighbouring molecules \n\nand orientational considerations. Moreover, adsorbed molecules can be easily degraded \n\nand covalent linkage techniques are often tedious and require several chemical steps. \n\nSol-gel encapsulation, given the versatility, inertness and biocompatibility of the \n\nmaterial, can reduce these problems [40,41]. The term encapsulation means the \n\nembedding of biomolecules into a sol-gel network \u2014 the silica condensation occurs \n\nsurrounding each macromolecule, which can also act as a template. The pores formed in \n\nthis way are in harmony with the molecule they host. If the biomolecule is an enzyme, it \n\ncan retain its catalytic activity, which means that the active site is allowed to adjust its \n\nconformation inside the \u201cnanocage\u201d. For the system to fulfil its function it is also crucial \n\nthat the enzyme substrates reach the enzyme and that the reaction products are able to \n\nleave the host. It is also important that the pores are big enough to permit the subtle \n\nchanges in protein structure as it undergoes catalysis. Thus, it is desirable that the \n\nenzyme is not adsorbed or covalently bonded to the matrix, although some of these \n\ninteractions may occur resulting in diminished catalytic efficiency [15]. \n\n \n\nThe unique reactivity of enzymes is well suited for application in the discovery \n\nof new compounds, for example in the synthesis of molecules and molecular \n\narchitectures that are difficult to achieve by traditional synthetic routes. Avnir and \n\nFrenkel-Mullerand have recently suggested, that confinement within the pore, rather \n\nthan just physically prevent detrimental conformational change can also provide \n\nchemical protection preserving enzymatic activity, even under extreme pH conditions \n\n[42]. \n\n 19\n\n\n\nMolecular confinement within silica nanopores can produce high volumetric \n\ncatalyst loadings with an enhancement in the enzymes thermal stability. This fact \n\nsupports the idea that sol-gel encapsulation can mimic the effects of molecular crowding \n\nand confinement in living cells [43-46]. Moreover, the entrapment of proteins in \n\ntransparent sol-gel silica matrices has enabled the analysis of the longer timescale \n\nfolding intermediates of cytochrome c to be elucidated and thus, redefine the folding \n\npathways [47]. This study suggests that the same methodology can be applied to study \n\nother proteins. \n\nAs previously stressed, silica gels can be produced with a large range of porous \n\ntextures and network structures under different processing conditions, depending on the \n\nobjective of the hybrid material [15,48,49]. Bioencapsulation in mineral/hybrid sol-gel \n\nhosts has been successfully attempted with a great variety of biological entities \n\nincluding numerous proteins, enzymes, antibodies, DNA, phospholipids and even whole \n\ncells [50]. This helps to explain the reason why investigation into sol-gel hybrid systems \n\nhas progressed dramatically over the past two decades.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4. Enzyme-based optical biosensors \n\n \nA biosensor is a sensing device in which the outcome of a biochemical process \n\nprovides a measurable response. In other words, a biological transducer undergoes a \n\nspecific biochemical reaction rendering a measurable analyte concentration [51].  In the \n\ncase of optical biosensors after interacting with the analyte a change in the optical \n\nproperties occurs. This information can be transmitted by means of an optical fibre or \n\nanother light propagation process. Bio-optrodes are constructed by immobilising \n\nbiological recognition components into optical fibres and are divided into two main \n\ncategories based on their bioactivity; biocatalysts (enzymes and cells) and bioaffinity \n\nmolecules (antibodies, receptors, and nucleic acids) [52]. \n\n \n\nThe use of enzymes as the chemical transducer has enabled notable progress in \n\nthe research of optical biosensors and has become indispensable. Many enzymatic \n\nreactions involve the use of coloured or luminescent substances, either as a substrate or \n\n 20\n\n\n\nproduct of reaction, which enables their direct detection. Changes in absorbance and \n\nfluorescence for instance can be directly detected using an optical biosensor. If the \n\nenzymatic reaction does not involve such substances, optochemical transduction is \n\nobligatory and indirect detection required [53]. Several enzyme-based optical fibre \n\nbiosensors have been reported, with applications in environmental, clinical, industrial, \n\nfood, pharmaceutical and biotechnological sectors [54,55]. \n\n \n\nEnzymes are the most efficient catalysts known. In the living cell, they control \n\nall metabolic pathways by simply lowering the activation energy necessary for \n\nreactions, which would otherwise proceed at an exceedingly slow rate. The well-known \n\nmechanism describing the reversible single-substrate enzyme reaction, proposed in \n\n1913 by Michaelis and Menten, is described by the scheme [56]: \n\n \n\n \n\nE + S ? ES ? E+P \n \n\nFigure 2.5. Scheme of the Michaelis-Menten model, valid for one-substrate reversible reactions. In the \n\nequilibrium expression (E) signifies enzyme, (S) substrate, (ES) Complex enzyme-substrate, and (P) \n\nproducts of reaction. \n \n\nFrom an analytical point of view, the enzyme\u2019s efficiency is a key feature, as are \n\nits reaction specificity and substrate selectivity. In fact, an enzyme chooses its substrate, \n\nselects the precise part of the molecule where to bind and can even differentiate optical \n\nisomers. All of these attributes allow straightforward catalysis to proceed, without side-\n\nreactions or by-products and with increasing efficiency [57]. Thus, an accurate analysis \n\nis possible as the enzyme\u2019s substrates (analytes) are selectively converted into species \n\nthat are easy to detect. However, it is known that the use of enzymes in large scale \n\ntechnological processes has some drawbacks. Procedures for enzyme recovery are \n\nusually expensive and, although not consumed by the reaction, they denature with time \n\nwith an associated loss in activity. If used in solution, purification is needed to obtain \n\nthe enzymes after the reaction and, if disposable, environmental consequences have to \n\nbe taken into account. For routine or on-site analysis, the immobilisation of enzymes is \n\nessential. The main benefit of immobilisation is the ability to separate the enzymes from \n\nthe reaction products, permitting the catalyst to be reused. This leads to greater \n\n 21\n\n\n\nefficiency as the number of reactions can be increased, along with the possibility to \n\nemploy higher substrate concentrations [53,58]. \n\n \n\nOne major advantage of optical biosensors is that they are very sensitive to low \n\nanalyte concentrations, sometimes reaching the single molecule level if fluorescence is \n\nused. Some enzymes already contain in their structure chromophoric or fluorescent \n\ngroups that can report on the reaction mechanism. There is however, the possibility of \n\nlabelling the enzyme with chromophoric or fluorescent dyes prior to its incorporation in \n\nthe supportive matrix [59]. Sol-gel glasses are promising materials for optical \n\nbiosensors. Their porosity, robustness, transparency in the UV and visible part of the \n\nspectrum along with the inherent flexibility of the sol-gel method has allowed the \n\nencapsulation of a wide range of enzymes.  Nevertheless, major fundamental questions \n\nrelating to this method remain to be optimised, thus explaining why it is still an intense \n\narea of investigation [52]. In the present work some of those questions will be \n\naddressed, namely: \n\n \n\n1. Kinetics in confining media \n\nThe temporal resolution achieved by the sensor is connected with the kinetics of \n\nthe enzymatic process. More precisely, the efficiency of the binding and transduction \n\nevents, determine how fast a measurement can be done. The Michaelis-Menten \n\nmechanism has been used to compare the kinetics of encapsulated enzymes with the \n\nkinetics in aqueous solution. The interpretation of the kinetic parameters is not \n\nstraightforward, because the accessibility of the analytes to the entrapped enzyme \n\n(largely determined by the pore size and electrostatics) can be limited. Furthermore, the \n\nsilanol content, pH conditions and the hydrophobicity of the matrix can influence the \n\nenzyme integrity [15,59]. Therefore, the kinetic measurements only do not discern \n\nbetween partitioning of the substrate and enzyme activity effects [60]. \n\n \n\n2. Microenvironment within the pores \n\nThe composition of the solution inside the pores of a sol-gel matrix is different \n\nfrom the bulk solution where the kinetic studies are usually performed, and it varies \n\nwith aging time. Differences in the pH, for example, may affect the enzyme kinetics and \n\nthe reaction mechanism. The external solution\u2019s pH, however, is not necessarily the \n\nsame as inside the pores [42]. Fluorescent probes have been successfully used to \n\n 22\n\n\n\nmonitor the sol-gel process, providing valuable information about the polarity of the \n\nsolvent entrapped within the pores [61-64]. However, these probes report only on their \n\nlocal environment.  \n\n \n\n3. Molecular mobility of the encapsulate \n\nA variety of techniques have been used to address molecular mobility in both \n\nbulk and sol-gel films, including fluorescence anisotropy, fluorescence correlation \n\nspectroscopy and single molecule tracking [65-67]. These studies have unravelled a \n\nnumber of environments within the sol-gel media, with different microviscosities. It was \n\nsuggested that the mobility of the molecule is inherent to its size, sol-gel preparation \n\nmethod and aging time [67].  \n\n \n\n4. Stability of the encapsulate \n\nSeveral studies have reported the enhanced stability of enzymes in sol-gel \n\nderived media [68-71]. The understanding of enzyme-host interactions seems to be a \n\npriority in order to improve the reactivity of these biomaterials [72]. Attempts to make \n\nthe sol-gel process more amenable for the encapsulation of biological molecules are \n\nplenty; they include alcohol-free, IPN and ORMOSIL manufacturing routes, addition of \n\nglycerol, sugars and other osmolites to alter the protein hydration [73,74].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 23\n\n\n\n2.5.

Introduction \n\n \nFluorescence is the most sensitive and versatile technique to investigate \n\nmolecular interactions within matter and it is used by scientists from different \n\ndisciplines. The past 20 years have witnessed an extraordinary increase in the \n\napplication of fluorescence in several fields of the biological sciences and it is presently \n\nthe leading research tool in biotechnology [1]. Fluorescence techniques have boosted \n\nnew discoveries in biomedical sciences and, reciprocally, these achievements have \n\npushed forward fluorescence measurement systems. An example is the sequencing of \n\nDNA by fluorescence (known since 1987), which enabled the completion of the human \n\ngenome sequence in 2001 [2,3]. This was decisive in the development of new methods \n\nand applications of fluorescence. Other emerging applications (e.g. analytical \n\nchemistry) are the result of advances in laser, detector and computer technology. These \n\nhave made it possible, for example, to create lifetime images of samples taking \n\nadvantage of sophisticated microscopy techniques [1,4]. Furthermore, the numerous \n\npublications on the use fluorescence to study the sol-gel process confirm the adequacy \n\nof this technique on monitoring sol-gel derived material [5]. \n\n \n\n 31\n\n\n\nFluorescent molecules report on their specific microenvironment (polarity, pH, \n\nhydrogen bonding, electric potential, etc) and their fluorescence properties quite \n\nfrequently show up differences between the bulk and nanoscale local environments \n\nwithin each material. Fluorescence is strongly influenced by interfacial interactions, \n\nproviding additional information, for example, on the local structure, confinement or \n\nmicroviscosity. The information obtained also depends on the techniques employed to \n\nmeasure fluorescence. Furthermore, progress in technology is reducing the cost of \n\nequipment, thus allowing measurements that would have been  considered exotic or \n\nimpractical [1,4]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Fluorescence \n\n \nThe absorption of ultra-violet or visible light by a molecule can result in the \n\nformation states of higher energy. Such excited states are very unstable and the \n\nmolecule returns rapidly to the ground state. This can occur with or without the \n\nemission of light. In the former the energy loss is called radiative and can give rise to \n\nthe phenomenon of luminescence. The latter produces a non-radiative de-excitation. The \n\nphenomenon of luminescence is formally divided into fluorescence, if the transition is \n\nbetween states of the same spin multiplicity, or phosphorescence if the transition is \n\nbetween states of different multiplicity. These processes are appropriately illustrated by \n\nthe Jablonski energy diagram, which is depicted in figure 3.1. The absorption of light or \n\nexcitation of a fluorophore is represented by the straight upward arrow from the ground \n\nelectronic single state (S0) to the excited states (S1, S2 etc) [1]. The subscripts 0, 1, 2, 3 \n\n\u2026 refer to the energy ranking of the state relative to the ground state (S0). \n\nSuperimposed on these electronic energy levels are a number of vibrational energy \n\nlevels. Triplet states (designated T) are populated via the first excited singlet state and \n\ninvolve a change (flip) of spin. The first triplet level located energetically above S0  is \n\nT1, where the subscript 1 indicates the energy ranking among triplets [6]. As these \n\nelectronic states are quantised the excitation energy, E has to match the energy \n\ndifference between the ground state and the higher energy electronic state. According to \n\nquantum mechanics, \n\n 32\n\n\n\n?\n?\n\n? hc\nc\n\nhhE ===      (3.1) \n\n \n\nwhere E is the energy, h is Planck\u2019s constant, c the speed of light, and ? the frequency of \n\nthe incoming photon, and ? the photon wavelength. \n\nThe absorption of a photon occurs on the femtosecond (10-15 seconds) timescale \n\nand can bring a molecule to high vibrational levels of S1, S2 ... Subsequently this is \n\nfollowed by vibrational relaxation of electrons from high energy excited state levels to \n\nthe lowest excited state energy level. This type of de-excitation process usually takes \n\nplace on the sub-picosecond (<10-12 seconds) timescale. Emission of photons from the \n\nlowest vibrational level of the first excited singlet state back to the ground state, called \n\nfluorescence, proceeds on the picosecond to nanosecond (10-9 seconds) time range. \n\nMolecules in S1, after undergoing spin conversion to the triplet state T1 (intersystem \n\ncrossing) emit radiation on a longer time scale (10-6 \u2013 1 second) commonly called \n\nphosphorescence. There are distinctive rate constants for each process, usually denoted \n\nas follows: fluorescence emission (kf), internal conversion S1 ? S0 (kic) and intersystem \n\ncrossing (kisc). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.

This is due to the numerous vibrational energy levels that occur in each \n\nelectronic state, thus producing a wide range of photon emissions. Compared with the \n\nabsorption spectrum, fluorescence emission is an approximate \u201cmirror image\u201d shifted to \n\nlonger wavelengths as result of energy loss in excited state interactions. The shift \n\n(figure 3.2) is known as the Stokes\u2019 shift, in honour of George Stokes, who is credited \n\nwith the first description of the phenomenon of fluorescence in 1852. \n\n \n\n \n\n S0 ?

Relative positions of absorption and fluorescence spectra. \n \n\n \n\nThere are three fundamental parameters used in fluorescence spectroscopy: the \n\nfluorescence spectrum e.g. the emission intensity measured upon steady state excitation; \n\nthe quantum yield (?F), ranging from zero to one, is the ratio between emitted photons \n\nand absorbed photons (equation 3.2). \n\n \n\nnrf\n\nf\nF kk\n\nk\n+\n\n=?

S0. knr is defined such knr = kic + kisc; finally, fluorescence lifetime (?) \n\ngives the characteristic time that a molecule stays in the excited state S1 before returning \n\nto the ground state and is given by the time that it takes for the intensity to drop to 1/e of \n\nits initial value. It is commonly written: \n\n \n\nnrf kk +\n=\n\n1\n?       (3.3) \n\n \n\nThe fluorescence decay with time is described by the function (3.4) where I is the \n\nfluorescence intensity measured at time t, I0 is the initial intensity observed immediately \n\nafter pulsed excitation and ? is the fluorescence lifetime.  \n\n \n\n?\nt\n\neItI\n?\n\n= 0)(       (3.4) \n\n \n\n \n\nFor an ensemble of fluorophores, some will emit soon after the excitation pulse, others \n\nwill emit at times longer than the molecules characteristic lifetime, according to \n\nstatistical physics.

The fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of molecules in the excited singlet \n\nstate. \n\n \n\n \n\n 35\n\n\n\n3.3. Excited state-host interactions \n \n\nWhenever immersed in a medium, the photophysics of a fluorescent probe, \n\ninevitably reports on the medium\u2019s characteristics through its interaction with the \n\nsurroundings. It is well-known that probe-host interactions are, in most cases, the result \n\nof: (a) electronic and/ or dipolar relaxation events, expressed as solvatochromic shifts in \n\nthe emission spectra; (b) hydrodynamic factors that arise from the probe mobility \n\n(translational and/or rotational), expressed by the influence of the viscosity of the host \n\nmedium on the photophysics of the probe, particularly on the nonradiative decay \n\nprocesses; and (c) other specific interactions, largely dependent upon the nature of the \n\nprobe and the host medium. \n\nSolvatochromism is caused by differential solvation of the ground-state and first \n\nexcited-state of the molecule (Franck-Condon excited state with the solvation pattern of \n\nthe ground state). If, with increasing solvent polarity, the ground-state of the molecule is \n\nbetter stabilised by the surrounding solvent molecules than the excited-sate, a \n\nhypsochromic (or blue) shift of the absorption band is observed. If, the excited molecule \n\nis better stabilised by solvation than the relaxed molecule, a bathochromic (or red) shift \n\nof the absorption band is observed. The difference between these two states is also \n\nresponsible for the solvent influence on the fluorescence emission. Since the time for \n\nthe excitation event (~10-15 s) is much shorter than the time required for rotational or \n\nvibrational motions (~10-12 \u2013 10-10 s), the nuclei (of the fluorophore plus the solvation \n\nshell) do not alter their position during the electronic transition. However, if the lifetime \n\nof the excitation is long enough, the solvent molecules around the fluorophore reorient \n\ntheir dipole moments accordingly, and solvent relaxation takes place. It is from this \n\nequilibrium excited state that fluorescence occurs. Solvent relaxation has the effect of \n\nreducing the energy gap between ground and excited states, resulting in a red shift of the \n\nfluorescence emission. Conversely, there is now a Franck-Condon ground state with a \n\nsolvation pattern of the excited state that slowly (10 to 100 picoseconds) reorganises to \n\nthe equilibrium ground state. It is easily understandable that solvatochromism depends \n\non the physico-chemical properties of the fluorophore and solvent molecules. In \n\ngeneral, dye molecules with a large change in their permanent dipole moments upon \n\nexcitation, display stronger solvatochromic shifts. If after excitation the dipole moment \n\nincreases a positive solvatochromism results. However, a decrease in the solute dipole \n\n 36\n\n\n\nmoment upon excitation results in a negative solvatochromism. Furthermore, the ability \n\nfor the solute to create hydrogen bonds with the solvent (either in the ground or excited \n\nFranck-Condon states) enhances the extent of the solvatochromic shift. Solutes with \n\nintramolecular charge transfer absorptions are an example of molecules that display this \n\nparticular solvatochromic behaviour and the dye Nile red is among them. Positive \n\nfluorescence solvatochromism is illustrated by figure 3.4.  \n\n \n\n(D-A)* \nD+-A-\n\nEnergy \n\nE\nxc\n\nita\ntio\n\nn \n\nD-A \n\nSolvent polarity \n \n\n \nFigure 3.4. Schematic representation of positive fluorescence solvatochromism. The non-polar ground \n\nstate D-A absorbs a photon and reaches the locally excited state (D-A)*, which subsequently decays into \n\na charge separated state. The solvent will stabilise this charge separated state by aligning its dipoles. The \n\nmore polar the solvent, the greater the stabilising effect will be and the more the excited state will be \n\nlowered in energy. At the same time the ground state, which is non-polar, will be destabilised. The net \n\nresult of these interactions is a decrease in the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state \n\nand thus a red shift in emission [7]. \n\n \n\n \n\nSeveral authors have established that the spectral shifts in the emission spectra (by \n\nreference to the vapour phase spectrum, ),  caused by local effects produced by \n\nelectronic and dipolar relaxation are adequately described by the following equations \n\n[8,9]: \n\n0\nFE\n\n \n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n+\n?\n\n?\n+\n?\n\n+\n+\n?\n\n=?=?\n2\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n12\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n22\n\n2\n\n1\n0\n\nn\nn\n\nC\nn\n\nn\nCEEE FFF ?\n\n?\n   (3.5) \n\n 37\n\n\n\nor \n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n+\n?\n\n?\n+\n??\n\n=???\n2\n1\n\n2\n12\n\n4\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0 n\nn\n\nRhcfluabs ?\n?\u00b5\n\n??\n??

A well characterised \n\nsolvatochromic effect has been observed for the dye Nile red in homogeneous media \n\n[10]. According to these authors the following data were found: \n\n),( 2nf ?\n\n0\nFE = 2.649 eV (487 nm) \n\nC1= -1.128 eV \n\nC2= -0.556 eV \n\n?\u00b5 = 6.1 D \n\n \n\nHydrodynamic effects are generally expressed through viscosity. However, when \n\nexamining molecular interactions, frequently the size of the probe is comparable to the \n\nsize of the surrounding medium molecules. Thus, the molecule under study probes the \n\nmedium as discontinuous. In this case, macroscopic viscosity becomes inaccurate to \n\ndescribe any observed effects. In the absence of a proper theory, phenomenological \n\napproaches have been employed by several authors [4,11]. This effect has been \n\naddressed in the present work as described in chapter 4 by adopting the concept of an \n\n\u201ceffective viscosity\u201d when studying the fluorescence of 4-(4- (dimethylamino)styryl)-N-\n\nmethylpyridiniumiodine (DASPMI). \n\n \n\nFinally, regarding specific interactions an important illustration of this type of \n\ninteraction is the hydrogen bond, also addressed during the course of this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n 38\n\n\n\n3.4. The quenching of fluorescence \n\n \nQuenching effects have been studied at the fundamental level, but also as a \n\nsource of information about biochemical systems [12,13]. The term quenching refers to \n\nany process that can result in effective reduction in fluorescence intensity. This can \n\nhappen simply by boosting the non-radiative relaxation pathways from the excited state \n\nelectrons to the ground state. Quenching processes may be either intramolecular or \n\nintermolecular and can reduce the excited state lifetime as well as the quantum yield of \n\nthe fluorophore. Examples include excited-state reactions, molecular rearrangements, \n\nenergy transfer, ground-state complex formation, and collisional quenching. Dynamic \n\nquenchers (e.g. O2, acrylamide, I-) reduce fluorescence intensity by collision, due to \n\ndiffusive encounters between the fluorophore and quencher during the lifetime of the \n\nexcited state. Quenchers are usually termed static (e.g. nicotinamide and heavy metals) \n\nif the fluorophore and quencher form a non-fluorescent complex in the ground state, \n\nthus reducing the population of excitable molecules [1]. \n\nCollisional quenching is described using the relation 3.7, called the Stern-\n\nVolmer equation where Io and I are, respectively, the steady-state fluorescence \n\nintensities in the absence and presence of quencher, [ ]Q  is the quencher concentration \nand kq is the bimolecular quenching constant, ?0 is the lifetime of the fluorophore in the \n\nabsence of quencher, and KD = kq ?0 is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant [4].  In the \n\nsimplest cases the Stern-Volmer plot (where the ratio Io/I is plotted against the quencher \n\nconcentration) gives a straight line with slope equal to KD\n \n\n[ ]Qk\nI\nI\n\nq 0\n0 1 ?+= [ ]QK D+= 1      (3.7) \n\n \n\nThe bimolecular quenching constant, kq, reflects the efficiency of quenching or the \n\naccessibility of the fluorophore to the quencher. An important characteristic of \n\ncollisional quenching is that the ratio Io/I is proportional to ?o/?. This happens because \n\nquenching is an additional competing process that depopulates the excited state [1]. \n\nSometimes both collisional and static quenching phenomena can occur simultaneously \n\nfor the same fluorophores. If so, a characteristic upward deviation from linearity is \n\nobserved in the Stern-Volmer plot [1,4]. \n\n 39\n\n\n\n3.5. Time-resolved fluorescence \n\n \nTime-resolved fluorescence is used to measure the excited state lifetime of a \n\nfluorophore. The knowledge of decay times can add precious information about rates \n\nand hence kinetics, where a simple steady-state measurement is insufficient. An \n\nexample is discrimination between dynamic and static quenching; dynamic quenching is \n\na rate process acting on the entire excited state population, decreasing the mean decay \n\ntime of the entire population [1,14]. \n\nThere are several methods available for time-resolved fluorescence \n\nmeasurements such as: streak camera measurements, fluorescence upconversion, time-\n\ncorrelated single-photon counting (TCSPC), among others. In this work, the chosen \n\nmethod was the most widely used, TCSPC, which presents several advantages namely, \n\nhigh sensitivity with possibility of detecting very low fluorescence intensities (down to \n\nthe single molecule level), large dynamic range, well defined statistics (Poisson) and \n\nintuitive data representation in the time domain [15]. \n\nThe underlying principle of TCSPC relies on the concept that the emission \n\nprobability of a single photon after the excitation event is equal to the intensity of \n\nemission of the ensemble of molecules over time. TCSPC allows measuring the arrival \n\ntime of a fluorescent photon after excitation. After a large number of excitation cycles, a \n\nhistogram of photon arrival times is built up [16,17].  \n\n \n\nUnless otherwise stated, in the work presented in this thesis, time-resolved \n\nmeasurements used a single-photon counting apparatus equipped with a NanoLED \n\nexcitation source emitting at 490 nm (HORIBA, Jobin Yvon, IBH Ltd. Glasgow, \n\nScotland). In order to minimise deadtime effects in the electronics, the equipment \n\noperated in \u201creverse mode\u201d, i.e. the pulse from the detector providing the START pulse \n\nand that from the source, providing the STOP pulse. This was necessary because of the \n\nhigh repetition rate of the LED used to excite the sample (800 KHz). The fluorescence \n\nemission was wavelength-selected using a 550 nm cut-off filter and detected with a \n\nHamamatsu R2949 photomultiplier.

Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) \n\n \nPhotobleaching is the light-induced irreversible conversion of a fluorescent \n\nmolecule into a non-fluorescent entity. The exact mechanism of photobleaching of \n\norganic dyes is complex and/or mostly unknown. In many cases, the excited triplet state \n\nand several intermediates are involved. A common cause of photodamage is the \n\noxidation of the dye by singlet oxygen or even water if the experiments are done in \n\naqueous solution.  Most fluorophores can repeat the excitation and emission cycle many \n\nhundreds to thousands of times before the highly reactive excited state molecule is \n\nphotobleached. This ability is dependent upon the molecular structure and the local \n\nenvironment. For instance, photobleaching increases with temperature because more \n\nreaction pathways become activated [22-24].  \n\n \n\nExperiments with Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) started \n\nalmost 40 years ago to observe the lateral mobility of proteins and lipids in living cells \n\n[25]. Since then many studies have been successfully done employing the technique as a \n\nvaluable tool to study diffusion in other environments than biological, namely polymer \n\nsolutions and gels [26-28]. In FRAP experiments fluorescent molecules are \n\nphotobleached by a high-power laser beam focused in the region of interest of the \n\nsample. Immediately after photobleaching an attenuated light beam measures the \n\ndiffusion of fluorescent molecules back into the bleached area from outside the \n\nirradiation zone. The intensity increases as the number of unbleached probes reaches the \n\nbleached area and a plot of intensity versus time is then obtained. Figure 3.6 shows a \n\ntypical FRAP curve. FRAP measurements require a microscope to image the sample. \n\n 44\n\n\n\nPhotobleach \n\nF1 \nF? \n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n \na \n\nF0 \n\nTime \n \n\nFigure 3.6.

These regions are shown in figure 3.6. \n\n \n\nb)  The rate of mobility or how quickly the molecules diffuse back into the \n\nbleached area. If a steep curve is found, there is a fast recovery. The mobility is \n\nexpressed as Dt, the diffusion coefficient, which is related to the diffusion time, \n\n?D. \n\n \n\nThe diffusion time, ?D can be calculated by finding the time it takes for the fluorescence \n\nto recover to half of its final value, ?1/2. The half time can be established by fitting the \n\nrecovery data to a curve of the form [29] \n\n \n\nCeAtI kt +?= ? )1()(      (3.18) \n\n \n\n 45\n\n\n\nWhere I is the fluorescence intensity, A is the final plateau intensity after recovery \n\nminus the initial intensity after bleaching i.e. (F? - F0 ), C is F0 and k is a time constant \n\n(?1/2= ln 2/k). The half time, ?1/2 is related to ?D by a factor ?D which takes into account \n\nthe recovery during the bleaching process. In the case of a circular beam ?D = 0.88 such \n\nthat [25] \n\n \n\n2/1\n\n2\n\n4\n88.0\n?\n?\n\n=tD      (3.19) \n\n \n\nWhere Dt is the translational diffusion coefficient which is related to the viscosity via \n\nthe Stokes-Einstein formula. \n\n \n\nr\nkT\n\nDt ??6\n=      (3.20) \n\n \n\nwhere r is the hydrodynamic radius of the sphere. \n\n \n\nAs is evident, FRAP provides complementary information to time-resolved \n\nanisotropy measurements, used to calculate viscosity where rotational diffusion is \n\nprobed instead of translational diffusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.8. Synchronous Scan Fluorescence Spectroscopy \n\n \nSynchronous Scan Fluorescence Spectroscopy (SFS) is a methodology \n\ndeveloped for multicomponent analysis and simple routine based applications by Tuan \n\nVo-Dinh, although the idea of synchronous excitation luminescence is attributed to \n\nLloyd, 1971 [30]. The applications of the method include the determination of \n\npolynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, qualitative and quantitative analysis (for \n\nenvironmental monitoring or drugs screening)[31-37]. \n\n \n\n 46\n\n\n\nThe synchronous fluorescence signal can be understood either as an emission \n\nspectrum with synchronously scanned excitation wavelength or as an excitation \n\nspectrum with synchronously scanned emission wavelength [30,38].  The SFS implies \n\nsimultaneously varying both the excitation wavelength (?exc) and the emission \n\nwavelength (?em) while keeping a constant interval (??) between them. The \n\nsynchronous fluorescence intensity, Is is given by the expression [30] \n\n \n\n)()( ??? ?+= exmexcxs EKcdEI     (3.21) \n\n \n\nwhere Ex is the excitation function at the wavelength ?exc, Eem is the emission intensity at \n\nthe wavelength ?em (normal emission spectrum), c is the analyte concentration, d is the \n\nthickness of the sample and k an experimental constant factor. The maximum intensity \n\nwith the narrowest half-width is obtained when ?? corresponds to the difference \n\nbetween the wavelengths of absorption and emission maxima. SFS presents three major \n\nadvantages over conventional fluorescence spectrometry: narrowing of spectral bands, \n\nsimplification of emission spectra and reduction of the spectral range (figure 3.7)  [30]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nExcitation spectrum EX(?\u2019) Emission spectrum EM(?) \n\n'\n0?\n\n'\n2?\n\n'\n1? 2?1?0?\n\n1?\n\n??\n\nSynchronous spectrum \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.7.

Introduction \n\n \nFluorescent dyes have an immense range of applications as reporters for structural \n\nchanges in proteins and other molecules, measuring different parameters in micro-\n\nheterogeneous systems or just as tags for analysis and sorting [1]. Choosing the \n\nappropriate fluorescent probe depends on the system to be monitored as well as \n\ntechniques to be employed. Sensitivity, selectivity, calibration method, labelling \n\ntechnique and the fluorescence spectral properties, are certainly important criteria when \n\nchoosing a fluorescent indicator [2]. Biological material is itself fluorescent. In proteins, \n\nthe intrinsic fluorescence is mainly due to the aromatic amino acid residues of \n\ntryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine.  The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the \n\njellyfish Aequorea victoria contains a built-in chromophore formed by the cyclization \n\nand oxidation of a sequence of amino acids (Serine \u2013 Tyrosine \u2013 Glycine). Today, GFP is \n\none of the most widely studied and exploited proteins in biochemistry and cell biology \n\n[3]. \n\nThere are, however, some adversities which make extrinsic labelling preferable to \n\nthe amino acid fluorescence study. First, in terms of time-resolved measurements, the \n\nphotophysics of tryptophan is complicated and the origin of its fluorescence decay is \n\n 53\n\n\n\nambiguous. Second, most proteins have more than one tryptophan residue, further \n\ncomplicating this scenario [4,5]. Also, the fluorescence quantum yield of phenylalanine is \n\nvery low (0.022 in aqueous solution) and, in the case of tyrosine, its fluorescence is often \n\nquenched by the neighbouring tryptophan residues [1]. In this work, extrinsic labelling \n\nwas preferred, not only because of the mentioned reasons, but also because the proteins \n\nwere monitored encapsulated within sol-gel media where scattered excitation light may \n\nbe problematic.  \n\n \n\nThis chapter focuses on the fluorescent probes utilised, which were chosen on the \n\nbasis of their particular properties to monitor the sol-gel reaction (the sol to gel transition \n\nand the aging process), to assess interactions between the host and guest molecules, and \n\nto elucidate conformational changes of the encapsulated proteins. Characterisation of \n\nboth the host environment and guest conformation is important, as the matrix is intended \n\nto be protective to the enzyme and simultaneously allow access to substrate molecules. \n\nOnly if these conditions are fulfilled can the entrapped biomolecule exercise its catalytic \n\nfunction. With this in mind, the probe 7-diethylamino-3,4-benzophenoxazine-2-one (Nile \n\nred) was selected to monitor both the host polarity and changes in protein conformation \n\n[6-8]. The dye 4-(4- (dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridiniumiodine (DASPMI), was \n\nchosen to assess the internal host viscosity [9-12]. A preliminary study was performed to \n\nexamine the photophysics of these two probes in homogeneous solution. The outcome is \n\ndiscussed in this chapter after a brief introduction to the mechanism by which they \n\nunravel the dynamics of the hybrid sol-gel systems. \n\nFluorescein was chosen to perform fluorescence recovery after photobleaching \n\n(FRAP) measurements, and Alexafluor 488 was selected to make a complementary study, \n\nbecause of its resistance to photobleaching. The derivative of fluorescein, fluorescein \n\nisothyocyanate (FITC) and Alexafluor 488 are both well used dyes for protein labelling \n\n[13-18]. Their photophysical properties are well characterised in the supplier\u2019s manual \n\n[19] and both of them were utilised according to the protocol provided by the \n\nmanufacturer.  \n\n \n\n \n\n 54\n\n\n\n4.2. DASPMI \n\n \nStilbenoid dyes are promising in that their photophysical properties are very \n\nsensitive to solvent viscosity [33]. The dye 4-(4- (dimethylamino)styryl)-N-\n\nmethylpyridiniumiodine (DASPMI) has been commonly used to study cellular processes \n\n[34,35] and its decay time found to be dependent on viscosity with its multiple \n\nfluorescence ascribed to intramolecular charge transfer [9,11]. Its properties were also \n\nexploited to provide an insight into the changes that occur in the sol to gel transition \n\n[10,36]. \n\nThe fluorescence of DASPMI is complex and has been related to the formation of \n\ncharge transfer states and associated conformational change with possibility of reaching \n\nthe Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT) state. The \u201cTICT\u201d model was \n\nsuggested by Lyppert et al. and later pushed forward by Grabowski and co-workers to \n\nexplain the dual fluorescence of the probe 4N,N-dimethylaminobenzonitrile (DMABN) \n\nin polar solvents.  The model is included in the area of adiabatic photoreactions which \n\noccur on the hypersurface of the lowest (singlet or triplet) exited state. When this state is \n\nenergetically very close to the ground state, the molecule can twist providing an efficient \n\nand fast non radiative transition to the ground state [23]. Depending on the motion, these \n\nmolecules require a specific reaction volume in order to take place; the smaller the \n\nvolume required, more easily the reaction occurs (figure 4.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAceptor  --\nDonor  ++  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. Molecular rotor consisting of two different moieties (donor and acceptor) in a TICT (twisted \n\nintramolecular charge transfer) sate. The typical TICT probe starts from a planar state geometry in the \n\nFranck-Condon excited state, with partial charge separation. As solvent relaxation occurs, the acceptor \n\nmoiety assists rotating towards a perpendicular conformation with full charge separation between the donor \n\nand the acceptor. Adapted from [24].  \n\n 55\n\n\n\nThe surrounding medium strongly influences the degree of the intramolecular \n\nmotion enabling  molecular rotors to be employed as fluorescent probes to characterise it \n\nin terms of micropolarity and microviscosity [25-28]. The twisting motion in the TICT \n\nmechanism can be easily hindered at very high viscosity conditions and rotors with \n\nvarious rotating moieties can be used as free-volume probes. Free volume effects derive \n\nfrom the discontinuous nature of matter which is composed by molecules of diverse sizes \n\nand shapes. The free space between these molecules provides an extra possibility for \n\nmovement, especially in biological membranes and solvents, which are highly dynamic \n\nsystems. Sometimes, it happens that the microviscosity or effective viscosity probed by a \n\nmolecular rotor is inferior to the bulk viscosity because of free volume effects [24]. \n\nThe emission of DASPMI (figure 4.2), in general, consists of three distinct decay \n\ntimes with emission from the planar form (state A in scheme II) and the possible \n\nconsecutive population of other states (B and C) via charge transfer and bond twisting: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nen\ner\n\ngy\n\nA\nB\n\nC\n\nN\n+\n\nCH3\n\nN\nCH3\n\nCH3\n\nen\ner\n\ngy\n\nA\nB\n\nC\n\nN\n+\n\nCH3\n\nN\nCH3\n\nCH3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 The fluorescent probe DASPMI and its fluorescent states. \n \n\nThis bond twisting (as the origin of the observed fluorescence) is restricted to single \n\nbonds, as the energy for a double bond mechanism is prohibitive under normal conditions \n\n[11] and work investigating the role of twisting in this class of molecule, showing the \n\neffect of inhibiting certain rotations, has confirmed single bond twisting as the dominant \n\n 56\n\n\n\nmechanism with a lack of isomerism [9]. As solvent viscosity increases the ability to \n\nrotate is reduced causing a reduction in the non radiative pathways, hence producing an \n\nincrease in the observed fluorescence lifetime.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Experimental characterisation of DASPMI \n\n \n4.2.1.1. Materials and methods \n\n \n\nThe dye p-DASPMI was purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitogen SA) and \n\nglycerol from Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn. Fluorescence quantum yields, ?F, in solution were \n\ndetermined relative to p-DASPMI in ethanol, reported to be 0.008 by Rettig and Strehmel \n\n[9]. The optically dilute method was adopted [37], and correction for the spectral \n\nresponse of the equipment was also made. Time-resolved measurements were performed \n\nas described in sections 3.5. and 3.6. The rotational correlation time, ?r, was calculated \n\nusing equation 3.13. \n\n \n\n4.2.1.2. Results and discussion \n\n \n\nThe photophysics of DASPMI was studied in water-glycerol mixtures, containing \n\ndifferent percentages of glycerol. Such mixtures were considered appropriate models \n\nbecause glycerol possesses several OH groups and water is a relevant species in the \n\nsynthesis of the sol-gel hybrids. All emission spectra, obtained upon excitation at 490 nm, \n\nshowed one broad maximum centred at 600 nm and no structure. All decays were found \n\nto be multiexponential, in agreement with previous work [9,11,33].

Time-resolved fluorescence decay parameters of DASPMI in glycerol-water mixtures. \n\n \n\nAccording to Rettig et al. [11], the multiple fluorescence emission is related to different \n\nstates: a planar excited state, originating directly from the S0 ? S1 transition, to which \n\nthe lowest lifetime is ascribed (?1); a second emitting state, planar and most probably with \n\na significant charge-transfer character (?2); and a third, a twisted intramolecular charge-\n\ntransfer excited state (TICT sate), associated with the longest lifetime component (?3). \n\nUnder the experimental conditions of this study, components ?1 and ?2 dominate the \n\nobserved decays. Only minute contributions ascribed to ?3 could be found, with negligible \n\nphysical significance. These results indicate that, most probably, the solvent cage \n\nsurrounding the excited dye molecule may hinder the twisting of the molecule, thus \n\nprecluding the formation of the TICT state. The \u201crigidity\u201d of the solvent cage is a \n\nconsequence of the hydrogen bonds that occur between the glycerol molecules and \n\nglycerol-water molecules [38]. This hypothesis is supported by arguments further \n\npresented in this section, when discussing the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy data. \n\nThe average emission lifetime for each sample was obtained from the analysis of the \n\nrespective fluorescence decay, according to equation 3.9. The radiative (kf) and \n\nnonradiative (knr) rate constants for DASPMI were then obtained from the well-known \n\nequations \n\n \n\nf\n\nF\nfk ?\n\n?\n=       (4.1) \n\n \n\n 58\n\n\n\n( )\nf\n\nF\nnrk ?\n\n??\n=\n\n1\n      (4.2) \n\n \n\nSince the emission decays were found to be multiexponential, the average emission \n\nlifetime was taken as ?f in the previous equations. All results are shown in table 4.2, \n\nwhere the refractive index (n) and the macroscopic viscosity (?) of each water-glycerol \n\nmixture are also indicated. \n \n\nSample \nComposition \n(wt % Gly) \n\nRefractive \nindex a\n\nRelative \nviscosity a \n\n(cP) \n\nQuantum \nyield b\n\nAverage \nlife-time \n\n(ns) \nkf (s\n\n-1) c knr (s\n-1) d\n\n80 1.4431 59.78 0.034 0.26 1.52x108 3.85x109\n\n84 1.4492 84.17 0.043 0.33 1.49x108 2.91x109\n\n88 1.4553 147.2 0.055 0.44 1.42x108 2.14x109\n\n92 1.4613 383.7 0.074 0.60 1.42x108 1.52x109\n\n96 1.4674 778.9 0.086 0.77 1.29x108 1.16x109\n\n100 1.4735 1759.6 0.206 1.03 2.34x108 7.37x108\n\n \n\nTable 4.2.

The goodness of fit (R) was 0.994. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis result indicates that the macroscopic viscosity is not appropriate to describe the \n\nmicroenvironment probed by DASPMI. In fact the free volume of the solvent mixture \n\nbecomes a relevant parameter and thus the probe senses the solvent as a discontinuous \n\nmedium [40]. This behaviour is understandable since the characteristic dimensions of the \n\nprobe are most probably comparable to the mean free path in the host media. The \n\napproximate volume of DASPMI, as calculated using Hyperchem 7 software, is \n\nestimated to be on the order of 240 \u00c53. A realistic approach to the hydrodynamics of \n\nDASPMI was obtained from time-resolved anisotropy measurements, performed as \n\ndescribed in the previous chapter (section 3.4). \n\nTable 4.3 shows the measured rotational correlation times (?r) and the initial \n\nanisotropy (r0). The limiting anisotropy (r?) was assumed to be zero throughout. The \n\nvalues found for r0 indicate that a significant part of the initial decay is observed. \n\nHowever, the fact that the values of ?r are somewhat longer than the fluorescence \n\nlifetimes (?f) precluded the measurement of the complete r(t) decay function.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 60\n\n\n\nSample \n\nComposition \n\n(wt % Gly) \n\n?r (ns) r0 ?\n2 ?eff (cP) VH (\u00c5\n\n3) RH (\u00c5) \n\n84 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 0.294 1.23 7.35 1791 7.5 \n\n88 5.7 \u00b1 0.9 0.280 1.25 9.45 2481 8.4 \n\n92 16.0 \u00b1 1.8 0.338 1.11 14.55 4525 10.3 \n\n96 15.6 \u00b1 1.4 0.231 1.20 20.01 3208 9.1 \n\n100 38.9 \u00b1 6.8 0.274 1.05 28.87 5544 11.0 \n\n \nTable 4.3.

All values found for VH were substantially higher than the approximate \n\nvolume of DASPMI (~240 \u00c53). These values show that the probe is associated with \n\nsolvent molecules (either glycerol or water). The positive charge of the dye molecule \n\nfacilitates its interaction with the solvent molecules, thus promoting the \u201cbinding of a \n\nsolvent cage\u201d to each DASPMI molecule, which rotates along with the dye. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 61\n\n\n\n4.3. Nile red \n\n \nThe term solvatochromism was introduced by Hantzsch (1857-1935) in the \n\nbeginning of the last century to express the phenomenon by which, UV/visible/near-IR \n\nabsorption spectra of molecules were influenced by the surrounding medium, in terms of \n\nposition, intensity, and shape of the absorption bands. The suggestion that solvatochromic \n\ndyes could be used as visual indicators for solvent polarity was initially made by Brooker \n\net al. (from Eastman  Kodak Company) in 1951 [20]. Nonetheless, examples of their \n\npractical use can be found prior to that date. For example, dyes of the Nile Blue group \n\nwere utilised as indicator standards to the detection and semi-quantitative estimation of \n\nacids in airplane motor fuels and lubricants [21]. Spectroscopic probes, however, can \n\nmeasure not only the polarity of liquids, but also that of solids, glasses and surfaces.  \n\nNile red (figure 4.4) is a neutral, hydrophobic, and highly solvatochromic dye \n\nwhich has been extensively applied to examine the structure, environment, and dynamics \n\nof biological samples and micro-heterogeneous media. Although nearly insoluble and \n\nnon-fluorescent in water, it has a very high partition coefficient from water to \n\nhydrophobic solvents, where it fluoresces strongly [8,41-48]. \n\n \n\nN O\n\nN\n\nO\n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.4. Structure of the fluorescent probe Nile red.\n\n \n\nNile red shows a positive solvatochromism, meaning that it undergoes a \n\nbathochromic shift both in absorption and in fluorescence spectrum with increasing \n\nsolvent polarity. The dramatic solvatochromic effect is attributed to the high dipole \n\nmoment of the molecule in the ground state, which is even higher during the excited \n\nstate.  The large shift has been explained through charge separation between the \n\n 62\n\n\n\ndiethylamino group which acts as a donor, and the quinoid system which acts as acceptor, \n\nwith the possibility of the formation of a twisted intramolecular charge transfer state \n\n(TICT) [6,49-51]. Still, two different groups have published theoretical and experimental \n\nwork where the TICT hypothesis is negated; one referring as an evidence the negligible \n\neffect of viscosity on the photophysical properties of the probe, the other a low value for \n\nthe difference between excited-state and ground-state dipole moments, reported as being \n\nincompatible with the formation of a TICT sate [52,53]. The fluorescence spectra of Nile \n\nred in organic solvents, is also suggestive of hydrogen bonding effects. This property is \n\nvisible when probing biphasic or biological systems  [53-58]. \n\nNile red has previously been used to monitor the conformation of horseradish \n\nperoxidase upon incorporation into a silica sol-gel derived host [59]. This was achieved \n\nby spectral decomposition of the fluorescence, showing that the probe experienced \n\ndifferent environments within the enzyme, each with a different critical F\u00f6rster distance \n\nfor energy transfer [60]. This thesis will concentrate on the fact that synchronous scan \n\nfluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) can be used to differentiate between different probes, or \n\nthe same probe in different environments, and employ it with Nile red. In solution the \n\nband position was found to depend on the polarity and influenced by the effect of \n\nhydrogen bonding. The combination of Nile red and SFS will be employed to elucidate \n\nchanges in protein conformation, as well as changes within the host during the aging \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Experimental characterisation of Nile red \n\n \n4.3.1.1. Materials and methods \n\n \n\nNile red was from Molecular Probes and the solvents were either from Sigma, \n\nAldrich or Fluka. The equipment used to measure Nile red spectra was described in \n\nchapter 3. The solvatochromic properties were observed by SFS in homogeneous \n\nsolution. \n\n \n\n 63\n\n\n\n4.3.1.2. Results and discussion \n\n \n\nIn this study, Nile red solvatochromic properties are reported for a large range of \n\nsolvents, from hexane to THF. Initially three different wavelength offsets were employed, \n\nas shown in figure 4.4 for three solvents. In a solvent of low polarity, such as hexane, the \n\ngreater offset spectrum is more structured, because of the vibrational features present in \n\nboth the normal absorption and emission spectra [61]. This structure decreases with a \n\nreduction of the offset between the excitation and emission wavelengths and is lost when \n\nan offset of 10 nm is used. In higher polarity media, all the spectra at the three different \n\noffsets exhibit a Gaussian band shape. This is not surprising as the normal absorption and \n\nemission spectra do not exhibit vibrational structure. It should be noted that the feature \n\n(small band) situated at 650 nm is present throughout and hence may relate to an artefact \n\nand thus will be ignored for the purpose of this work.  \n\n \n\n \n\n450 500 550 600 650\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\nTHF\n\nin\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n /a\nu\n\nexcitation wavelength /nm\n\n 10nm\n 20nm\n 50nm\n\noffset\nhexane DMSO\n\n \n \nFigure 4.5. Effect of wavelength offset (10 nm squares, 20 nm circles, 50 nm triangles) on synchronous \n\nscan spectrum of Nile red in a solvent of low (hexane), moderate (THF \u2013 dotted lines) and high (DMSO) \n\ndielectric constant. The spectra are shown normalised. \n\n \n\n \n\n 64\n\n\n\nA compromise offset of 20 nm was chosen for a larger study as it indicates whether the \n\nspectra possess any vibrational structure, while producing an easily identifiable peak. \n\nFigure 4.6 shows the spectra of Nile red in various solvents and figure 4.7 is a plot of the \n\nrespective peak wavelength against the solvent dielectric constant. The observed trend is \n\nin accordance with studies using the Nile red fluorescence emission [62,63]. Therefore, in \n\nadopting SFS of Nile red with the 20 nm offset, it is possible to obtain an \u201ceasy to use \n\nlocal polarity sensor\u201d. Figure 4.7 clearly shows a relationship between the peak position \n\nof the synchronous scan spectrum and the dielectric constant of the solvent used. As \n\nexpected, the behaviour in alcohols (shown by open symbols) is different [53] and a red \n\nshift is observed for this class of solvents in comparison to the others of similar dielectric \n\nconstant. It is notable that using this technique, small changes in relatively low values of \n\ndielectric constant produce a relatively large change in spectral position. However, it \n\nshould be noted that a constant wavelength offset is used, as the apparatus does not allow \n\nthe use of a constant energy offset set up. At higher values of dielectric constant (greater \n\nthan 10) smaller peak shifts are observed. In summary, these data provide an expedient \n\nmeans by which to detect changes in dielectric constant and to assess the contribution of \n\nhydrogen bonding in the measured spectral shifts, over a range of polarities pertinent to \n\nthe present system. \n\n \n\n500 550 600 650\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n / \nau\n\nexcitation wavelength / nm\n\n Isoctane\n Cyclohexane\n Hexane\n Heptane\n Toluene\n Acetone\n Methanol\n Propanol\n Ethanol\n Acetonitrile\n Butanol\n DMF\n DMSO\n THF\n\n \nFigure 4.6.

Fluorescein, FITC and Alexa Fluor 488 \n\n \nFluorescein is the most widely used green fluorescent dye. This is because of its \n\nlarge molar absorptivity at the wavelength of the commonly used Argon ion laser (488 \n\nnm spectral line) and its high fluorescence quantum yield. Fluorescein is commercially \n\navailable in many derivatives, such as fluorescein isothyocyanate (FITC). It is also \n\nsusceptible to photobleaching which makes it a good probe for carrying out fluorescence \n\nrecovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements. Alexa Fluor 488 is a similar probe \n\nin its fluorescence properties and it is also efficiently excited by the 488 laser line of the \n\n 66\n\n\n\nArgon ion laser. It is made by the sulfonation of dyes like rhodamine or fluorescein to \n\nbecome charged and hydrophilic. It also has a high quantum yield when coupled to \n\nproteins [29-32]. The structure of fluorescein, FITC and Alexa Fluor 488 can be seen in \n\nfigure 4.8. \n\n \n\nO OOH\n\nCOOH\n\n          O O\nOH\n\nCOOH\n\nN\n\nC\n\nS\n\n    \n\nC\n\nO\n\nO\nFF\n\nF F\n\nC O\nO\n\nSO3SO3\nNH2 NH2\n\nO\n\n(CH3CH2)3 NH\n\n--\n\n-\n\n+\n\n+\n\n2 +\n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8.

Introduction \n\n \nThe encapsulation of enzymes in sol-gel-derived media provides a form of \n\nimmobilization (important for reuse, cost, and environmental factors) while allowing \n\naccessibility so that the enzyme can continue to function as a biocatalyst. This \n\nprocedure can be followed using spectroscopic means and the incorporated protein \n\nmonitored by either making use of intrinsic protein fluorescence or extrinsic probes. \n\nThe latter are advantageous as they can be chosen for their selectivity. Previous work \n\nhas shown that encapsulation within a sol-gel-derived medium can restrict protein \n\nmobility, although the doping biomolecules can serve as a template for silicate [1-3]. It \n\nis therefore important to gain an understanding of guest-host interactions to enable the \n\nencapsulated biomolecule to exhibit its natural form and behaviour. \n\nTime-resolved fluorescence anisotropy [4] and fluorescence recovery after \n\nphotobleaching (FRAP) [5] are appropriate techniques with which to obtain information \n\nconcerning the mobility of the encapsulated biomolecule. FRAP probes the translational \n\ndiffusion, whereas time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements probe \n\nrotational diffusion. The discrimination between translational and rotational diffusion \n\nhas yielded an insight into protein association in viscous media [6] and, the particular \n\ncombination of FRAP and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements have \n\n 75\n\n\n\npreviously been employed, for example, in the study of the rheological properties of cell \n\ncytoplasm using green fluorescent protein [7]. However, to our knowledge, FRAP has \n\nbeen scantily applied to the study of sol-gel-derived media. In this chapter experimental \n\nresults which have helped to clarify the diffusion process within sol-gel derived media \n\nwill be presented, employing these techniques with selected fluorescent probes and \n\nbiomolecules. \n\nIn order to assess molecular mobility within the host two biomolecules, \n\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), both labelled with the \n\nfluorescent probe fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) which has known photobleaching \n\nproperties, were encapsulated in sol-gel matrices. The fluorophore itself was used \n\nunbound as representative of an enzymatic substrate.  The enzyme HRP was also \n\ncovalently labelled with the highly photostable probe Alexa Fluor 488 (AF) to ascertain, \n\nboth the distribution of the biomolecules and their rotational diffusion within the \n\nmatrices. This was accomplished using a confocal microscope [8,9]. The mobility of the \n\nbiomolecules during the aging process was monitored via fluorescence lifetime, time-\n\nresolved anisotropy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) \n\nmeasurements [10]. \n\nFurthermore, adjustment of the original sol-gel recipe was attempted in order to \n\nobtain a more efficient system where the encapsulated biomolecule could express its \n\nbiological function in full. This resulted in the manufacture of organically modified \n\nsilica matrices (ORMOSILS) and interpenetrating polymer network matrices (IPN), \n\nachieved through the incorporation of either the silanes (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane \n\n(APTES), trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS) or (glycidyloxypropyl)triethoxysilane \n\n(GPTES), or  the polymers poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG20k, PEG300) and Gelrite\u00ae \n\n(GR). The chosen silanes have hydrophobic functionalities and were added to promote \n\nthe biocompatibility, as the enhanced hydrophobic character of the matrices should \n\npreserve the protein folding [11,12].  The polymers were added because of the proven \n\ncapability of pore templating which should help to control the flow of materials through \n\nthe sol-gel composites [3,13]. The effect of these modifiers upon the gelation and aging \n\nprocesses was examined via time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence measurements \n\nof the of the probes 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridiniumiodine (DASPMI) \n\nand Nile red. DASPMI was used to elucidate changes in viscosity and Nile red to report \n\non changes in polarity. \n\n 76\n\n\n\n5.2. Monitoring gelation and initial aging phases \n\n \n5.2.1. Materials and methods \n \n\nThe matrices were prepared based on the method presented by Flora and Brennan \n\n[14] in the form of a monolith using a standard 10 mm path length plastic cuvette for a \n\nmould. The sol was made by mixing 9 ml of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (Aldrich) \n\nwith 3 ml of water containing 0.2 ml of 0.01 M HCl. This mixture was placed in an \n\nultrasonic bath for 1 h before being placed in a freezer (-18 \u00b0C) for about a month. The \n\nmatrices were produced by taking 2 ml of the sol and mixing it with 2 ml of pH 6, 7 or 8 \n\nphosphate buffer solutions containing the fluorophore DASPMI. No additional silanes \n\nor polymers were used here, so the monoliths produced are purely inorganic. \n\nFluorescence measurements and data analysis were described in chapter 3. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Results and Discussion \n \n\nSince the objective of producing these matrices is the incorporation of proteins, \n\nbuffer solutions with different pH values (pH 6, 7, and 8) were used in order to ascertain \n\nthe effect of this factor on the gelation process (figure 5.1). The emission spectra of \n\nDASPMI, in all three buffer solutions were identical to the spectrum of DASPMI in \n\nwater, measured under the same instrumental conditions. In fact, all spectra were \n\nstructureless, highly symmetrical, and centred at 600 nm. The pH values were also \n\nrestricted to a range so as not to protonate DASPMI, since this can lead to spectral \n\nchanges [15,16]. Figure 5.1 shows the relative fluorescence intensity of DASPMI as a \n\nfunction of time, during the gelation and initial aging processes. The intensity of the \n\nDASPMI emission (under the same conditions) for different glycerol-water mixtures \n\n(percent glycerol shown) is indicated as dashed lines. These results show that samples \n\nproduced using higher pHs are more viscous. Moreover, the relative intensity of the \n\nemission suffers a drastic increase during the gelation process, for pH=7 and pH=8 \n\nsolutions. \n\n 77\n\n\n\n0 100 200 300 400\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\n193000\n\n194000\n\n195000\n\nin\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n)\n\ntime (seconds)\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n40%\n\npH8\n\npH7\n\npH6\n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.1.

The intensity of DASPMI \n\nemission (under the same conditions) for different glycerol-water mixtures (% glycerol shown) are \n\nindicated by the dashed lines. \n\n \n\nThe observed enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield is in agreement with the \n\nresults obtained with water-glycerol mixtures and also with the work of Strehmel and \n\nRettig [17]. These authors have reported a significant increase in fluorescence intensity \n\nand emission lifetime of o-DASPMI upon an increase in solvent viscosity. More \n\nrecently, Ramadass and Bereiter-Hahn [18] observed a drastic increase in the emission \n\nlifetimes of o-DASPMI with an increase of solvent viscosity. \n\nIn all subsequent studies pH 7 was adopted in conformity with the requisites of the \n\nencapsulated biomolecules. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3. Guest-host interactions \n \n\n5.3.1. Materials and methods \n \n\nEnzyme Labelling. \n\nFor the first set of measurements, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) [CE 1.11.1.7][10] \n\nfrom Sigma, MW = 44,000 [19] was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF) and then \n\n 78\n\n\n\npurified following the provided protocol using a Molecular Probes Alexa Fluor 488 \n\nprotein labelling kit (A-10235) from Invitrogen S.A. The molecular weight of Alexa \n\nFluor 488 is ca.885. Fluorescein (MW 332) was from Sigma-Aldrich. \n\nIn a second phase, HRP and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (MW ca.67000) were \n\nlabelled with fluorescein isothiocianate (FITC) (MW = 389.38) and then purified to \n\nexclude any uncoupled dye, following the provided protocol and using a Fluoro Tag \n\nFITC conjunction kit (Sigma). The labelling ratio was approximately 1:1. The size of \n\nFITC is similar to fluorescein which has a radius of 0.54 nm [10], whereas HRP has a \n\nradius of 1.5 nm and BSA a radius of 3.5 nm [20,21]. Sol\u2013gel derived media to \n\nincorporate the proteins were produced by taking 2 ml of sol (prepared as described in \n\nthe previous section) and mixing it with 2 ml of buffer solution containing the labelled \n\nBSA or HRP or fluorophore. The gels were stored in a refrigerator (at 4 \u00b0C) and after \n\napproximately 12 h it was possible to remove them from their moulds (standard 10mm \n\npathlength plastic cuvette). They were then rinsed with distilled water and allowed to \n\nwarm up to room temperature before the measurements. \n\n \n\nMeasurements and Analysis \n\nAbsorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using the equipment \n\nmentioned in chapter 3. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of FITC \n\nlabelled biomolecules, were made using a 470 nm laser diode excitation source (PLP-10 \n\n470, Hamamatsu, optical pulse width 90 ps) pulsed at 20MHz and coupled with a \n\nfluorescence lifetime imaging system (Becker &amp; Hickl TCSPC system using a SPC 830 \n\ncard). The laser beam was passed through a prism to spatially separate the 470 nm from \n\na weak green laser emission around 500 nm and subsequently coupled into the scanhead \n\nusing a 485 nm dichroic beamsplitter. The fluorescence decays were measured \n\nsequentially at polarisations parallel and perpendicular to that of the excitation beam. \n\nThe fluorescence was collected through a 525 nm interference filter (50 nm bandpass) \n\nfor 20 s in each polarization in 256 time channels. These measurements were performed \n\nat the Physics Department, King\u2019s College London. \n\nTime-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of Alexa Fluor 488, were \n\nmade using equipment mentioned in chapter 3. For the analysis, the \u201cwobble in cone\u201d \n\nmodel was employed and the cone angle ? calculated using equation 3.16, which has \n\nbeen successfully applied in polymer systems [22]. The rotational correlation time was \n\ncalculated through the Stokes-Einstein relation expressed in equation 3.13. Theoretical \n\n 79\n\n\n\ncalculations of the volumes were obtained from the qualitative structure activity \n\nrelationships (QSAR) computation using Hyperchem 7 software on geometrically \n\noptimised molecular structures (using a PM3 model for the dyes or AMBER for HRP) \n\n[23]. \n\nFRAP measurements of fluorescein in sol-gel medium were performed using an \n\ninverted confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2) with a x63 water immersion objective \n\nand 488 nm excitation from an argon ion laser. To obtain FRAP curves, five initial \n\nintensity images were taken over an area of 288 \u00b5m2, at 2 s intervals. The laser power \n\nwas then increased and an area of approximately 1002 \u00b5m2 was photobleached. The \n\nfluorescence recovery of this area was monitored by reducing the laser power and \n\nrecording images every 5 s for 200 s (512 x 512 pixels, 400 Hz line scan rate). \n\nRegarding the matrices doped with biomolecules (labelled with FITC), confocal \n\nmicroscopy was performed using the confocal microscope with a x20 objective \n\n(numerical aperture NA=0.5), with the pinhole set to 1 airy unit (102 \u00b5m) yielding an \n\noptical section of approximately 2 \u00b5m. The excitation source was the same, coupled into \n\nthe scanhead using a RSP500 dichroic beamsplitter. In order to obtain the FRAP \n\nmeasurements initial intensity images were taken over an area of 750 \u00b5m2 for 1.6 s. The \n\nlaser power was then increased and a spot approximately 40 \u00b5m in diameter was \n\nphotobleached for 1.6 s. The fluorescence recovery of this area was monitored by \n\nreducing the laser power (20% that of the bleach intensity) and recording images every \n\n1.6 s for about 1 minute. In both cases, the recovery curves obtained were corrected by \n\nselecting a sample region away from the bleached region of interest and thus obtaining \n\nfluorescence intensity vs. time curve (control curve) and dividing the raw recovery \n\ncurve by it.  The time taken for the recovery to reach half of the final intensity, ?1/2, was \n\ncalculated from fitting the recovery to a curve of the form expressed in equation 3.18 \n\nusing Microcal Origin software. The translational diffusion coefficient Dt was \n\ncalculated from equation 3.19. All FRAP measurements were performed at the Physics \n\nDepartment, King\u2019s College London. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 80\n\n\n\n5.3.2.

The time-resolved data showed a more discernible \n\nchange going from monoexponential decay to biexponential decay for the AF-HRP \n\nconjugate. Here the difference was the emergence of a small contribution of a shorter-\n\nlived component. The origin of this component may relate to the covalent linkage and \n\npossibly to the local amino acid residues. \n\n \n\n 81\n\n\n\nmeasurement  AF AF-HRP \nsteady state absorption Max.

Absorption  and fluorescence data for unbound Alexa Fluor (AF)  and Alexa Fluor bound to \n\nHRP (AF-HRP) in buffer solution. \n\n \n\nAnother difference was noted in the time-resolved anisotropy data; for uncoupled AF, \n\nas expected, a very fast rotational time (0.25 ns), close to the resolution of our \n\nequipment, was observed. This is similar to that obtained using equation 3.13 with V \n\ncalculated from the QSAR properties for AF (assuming a viscosity of 0.89 cP and \n\ntemperature of 300 K), which returned 0.30 ns. The anisotropy decay obtained for the \n\nAF-HRP conjugate required two rotational correlation times to provide an acceptable \n\nfit. The shorter one we attribute to the dye rotation, while the longer one reflects the \n\nmotion of the whole of the enzyme. A similar trend has been previously reported [24]. \n\nOur calculation of this rotational time returned a close value of 6.5 ns. As the r? value \n\ndoes not go to zero, this implies a small degree of hindrance (cone angle of 74\u00b0 \n\naccording to equation 3.16), which is not surprising as the AF is covalently bound to the \n\nenzyme. As the hindrance is small, it is indicative that AF most likely binds to the \n\nexterior of the protein. To verify this, a quenching study using potassium iodide (KI) \n\nwas performed. The effect of the quencher on the steady-state fluorescence is shown in \n\nfigure 5.3.  \n\n \n\n 82\n\n\n\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n(I\n0 \n/ I\n\n) \n-1\n\n[KI] (M)\n\n AF-HRP\n AF\n\n \nFigure 5.3. Change in steady state fluorescence intensities (I) of AF and AF-HRP in solution on addition \n\nof potassium iodide (KI). The line depicts a simple fit to the Stern-Volmer equation for the AF-HRP data. \n \n\nThe plot shows that at lower quencher concentrations there is little difference between \n\nthe unbound and bound AF. A Stern-Volmer quenching constant of 21.7 M-1 was \n\nobtained from the slope of the line represented in the figure [25]. At higher \n\nconcentrations of KI there is an upward trend in the data, which may signify the \n\npresence of processes other than a straightforward dynamic quenching mechanism. This \n\nis not surprising considering the charged nature of the quencher. However, the \n\nsimilarity of the curves at low quencher concentration supports the of the probe attached \n\nto the exterior of the enzyme. \n\n \n\nDiffusion within sol-gel derived media \n\nTime-resolved anisotropy measurements were performed on the AF-HRP \n\nconjugate encapsulated into a sol-gel matrix over a period of time in which the sample \n\nchanged from a solid gel to a glassy robust matrix, occupying about 1/8 of the volume \n\nof the initial gel. Confocal microscopy showed the distribution of the encapsulated \n\nenzyme within the matrix to be uniform. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy \n\nmeasurements were made to provide a means by which to monitor the enzyme\u2019s \n\nrotational mobility.

Rotational correlation times for AF bound to HRP, both before and after incorporation into a \n\nsol-gel derived monolith. The open symbols relate to the rotation of the entire enzyme, while the closed \n\nsymbols are ascribed to the probe\u2019s own rotation. \n\n \n\nOn incorporation there is an initial increase in the rotational correlation time probably \n\nbecause of a raised viscosity as the matrix gels. After that, as the pore structure starts to \n\nform, the value returns close to that of the conjugate in solution. These data indicate \n\nthat, although the matrix network is contracting, the local environment of the enzyme is \n\ncomparatively stable, unlike that encountered in another study [1]. It should be noted \n\nthat a slight decrease in the cone angle was observed, dropping to ca. 53\u00b0 after 7 days \n\nand dropping by another few degrees over the remaining period. This may indicate \n\nslight changes in the enzyme conformation, in agreement with previous studies reported \n\nby our group [26] or that the enzyme is experiencing a viscosity close to that in solution, \n\nbut with some mobility restriction imposed by the host. Over the same time period the \n\nfluorescence lifetime data exhibited little variation from the corresponding data in \n\nsolution, thus reinforcing the suitability of this system. \n\n \n\nAlthough the enzyme appears free to rotate within the pore, it is important to \n\nascertain if it is also free to relocate within the matrix and importantly, if it is to be \n\ncatalytically active, accessible to its substrate. In order to verify this, FRAP \n\nmeasurements using a confocal microscope were performed with fluorescein (Fs) \n\nincorporated in the same type of sol-gel-derived monolith. FRAP has previously been \n\nused to characterize sol-gel-produced matrices, where dyes were found to diffuse only if \n\n 84\n\n\n\nthe matrices were hydrated [27].

Comparison of the sensed viscosity obtained using FRAP measurements of Fs and anisotropy \n\nmeasurements of unbound AF. \n\n \n\nAn explanation for this is that the rotational diffusion provides information concerning \n\nthe pore environment, while the translation diffusion gives information relating to \n\ninterconnections between pores; the enhancement in viscosity sensed by AF means that \n\nthe network shrinks with time (see figure 5.7). Thus, the two sets of measurements \n\n(FRAP and time resolved anisotropy) are complementary in following the changes in \n\nmatrix morphology. \n\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n%\n o\n\nf i\nni\n\ntia\nl w\n\nei\ngh\n\nt \n\ntime (days)  \nFigure 5.7. Depiction of the percentage change in weight of a sol-gel derived matrix with time, when \n\nkept at 4\u00baC. \n\n \n\nIt should be emphasised that we are looking at the average behaviour of many Fs \n\nmolecules. Work at the single molecule level has elucidated that the pore size is \n\nimportant on the diffusion within sol-gel derived monoliths, once two different \n\ncomponents relating to mobility were found; one in gels with a pore diameter of about 3 \n\nnm, and the other in gels with pores of about 22 nm [28,29]. In comparison to that work, \n\n 86\n\n\n\nthe diffusion coefficients presented above are several orders of magnitude greater than \n\nthose found for a silica gel with pores ca. 22 nm in diameter and using a larger probe \n\nmolecule. Nevertheless, the rotational diffusion of the enzyme hints that there is no \n\nsignificant interaction with the pore. Most probably HRP efficiently templates the pore \n\nsize of its host, hence, the pores inhabited by the biomolecule should be significantly \n\nlarger than its own dimensions [22].  \n\nThe photostability of Alexa Fluor 488 limits its usefulness in FRAP \n\nmeasurements, where a fluorescein derivative, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), \n\nproved advantageous. Three sol\u2013gel derived hosts were monitored with aging time by \n\nmeans of FRAP and fluorescence anisotropy measurements with the aim of examining \n\nlateral and rotational diffusional of macromolecules, respectively. The samples were \n\nproduced as follows: one monolith containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), a \n\nsecond one doped with bovine serum albumine (BSA) labelled with FITC (FITC-BSA) \n\nand a third one doped with HRP labelled with FITC (FITC-HRP). The FRAP \n\nmeasurements are given in figure 5.8.

The relative sizes of the molecules incorporated \n\nwithin the sol-gel derived host are also shown (for clarity only the backbone structure is given). \n\n 87\n\n\n\nRegarding FITC-BSA sample, negligible recovery was observed after bleaching, \n\nindicating that the pore interconnections were already smaller than the dimensions of \n\nthe protein, one day after encapsulation. Subsequent measurements confirmed that \n\nrotational motion had, in fact, ceased and that the pore size was at least comparable to \n\nthat of BSA. The corresponding time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements \n\nshowed that the protein was barely able to rotate (figure 5.9). \n\n \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nTime / ns\n\n BSA\n HRP\n FITC\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nTime / ns\n\n FITC\n HRP\n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nA\nni\n\nso\ntr\n\nop\ny\n\nTime / ns\n\n BSA\n HRP\n FITC\n\n \n\nFigure 5.9. Anisotropy decays for day 2, 9 and 12 days respectively, after making sol-gel for all 3 \n\nsamples. \n\nIn the case of FITC-HRP sample, the amount of photobleaching observed was \n\ncomparatively less and a partial recovery in the fluorescence was seen. Ten days later \n\nthe recovery was no longer observed, indicating that the interconnections between the \n\npores were probably with a size such as to limit the lateral diffusion of this enzyme. No \n\nnoticeable lateral diffusion was observed after 12 days. Time-resolved fluorescence \n\nanisotropy results show significant rotational freedom which decreases with time (figure \n\n5.9). This is in good agreement with prior measurements using Alexa Fluor 488 labelled \n\nHRP, which showed an average rotation correlation time of 3.2 ns after 12 days, with \n\nonly a minor degree of hindering over a period of over five weeks in the same type of \n\nmatrix. Thus, we reinforce the idea that, although the connections between the pores \n\nmay somewhat hinder lateral diffusion, the matrix does appear to template about the \n\nenzyme and the pore size must be greater than that of the HRP molecule, although \n\nsmaller than that of BSA.  \n\nFinally, the diffusion of FITC between the pores is relatively free, as can be seen \n\nin figure 5.8. The full recovery back to 1 indicates that initially there is no significant \n\nimmobile fraction, i.e. it appears to be no adhesion of FITC to the pore walls (the results \n\nusing fluorescein show a similar behaviour). However, an immobile FITC fraction \n\nappears with time, as indicated by the lack of a full recovery from around day 15. The \n\n 88\n\n\n\ncorresponding time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, which initially show a free \n\nrotation, begin to exhibit r? > 0, indicative of a hindered rotation (figure 5.9). It is worth \n\nto mention here, that time-resolved anisotropy data of unbound AF (figure 5.6) are \n\nconsistent with this observation which hints to an increase of the pore viscosity with \n\ntime. \n\n \n\nIn summary, the adopted methodology of combining FRAP and time-resolved \n\nfluorescence anisotropy measurements allowed the determination of diffusion properties \n\nof biomolecules entrapped within sol-gel derived hosts. Although the matrix can \n\ntemplate around an incorporated biomolecule, there is a size limit to this. Only small \n\nmolecules display high mobility and are relatively free to circulate within the matrix, \n\nwhile a molecule the size of HRP will be retained within the internal pore structure, as \n\nsummarised in figure 5.10. These are important considerations regarding the use of \n\nthese materials for biosensor applications. \n\n \n\n \n\naging time \n\nBSA \n\nHRP\n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 5.10.

Intensity of DASPMI steady state emission during the gelation and initial aging of modified \n\nsamples. Excitation was at 490 nm with emission maxima at 600 nm.  \n\n \n\nThis figure shows that the reaction is more extensive when GR or PEG20k is present. \n\nGR is a polysaccharide with self-gelling properties composed of glucose, glucoronic \n\nacid, and rhamnose moieties [30]. It is probable that, when mixed with the sol it favours \n\nthe silica polymerization along its branches, thus explaining the highest intensity of \n\nDASPMI emission in its presence. The length of the polymer chain is apparently \n\nimportant, since figure 5.12 shows that PEG300 has considerably less effect than \n\nPEG20k in the building of the matrix network. The results are in agreement with the \n\nwork of Shchipunov et al. confirming that polysaccharides and polymers enhance the \n\npolymerization of the SiO2 network by creation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl \n\ngroups of the macromolecules and the silanol products of TEOS hydrolysis [13,31]. The \n\nremaining modifiers (APTES, TMPS, and GPTES) do not significantly alter the \n\ngelation and initial aging rates, as can be seen by comparison between the curves in \n\nfigure 5.12 and the gelation curve at pH 7 in figure 5.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 92\n\n\n\n5.4.2.2. Long-term monitoring of the aging process \n\nIn order to characterise the sol-gel derived media both DASPMI and Nile red \n\nwere employed. DASPMI was used to elucidate changes in viscosity by monitoring \n\nchanges in its fluorescence emission and lifetime. Nile red should, because of its \n\nhydrophobic nature, locate at the interface between the bulk oxide material and the \n\ninternal pore structure. Therefore it can report on changes in polarity in this region. \n\n \n\na) Steady state monitoring: DASPMI emission \n\nThe aging process was monitored during a period of over 40 days, in which the \n\nsteady-state emission of DASPMI was measured periodically. Figure 5.13 shows the \n\nchanges observed in the fluorescence intensity of the dye with aging time. Difference \n\nspectra were calculated using Microcal Origin 7 software by normalising the emission \n\nspectra at the maximum and subtracting from a reference spectrum taken just after \n\ngelation (day 0). As the aging progresses, a solvatochromic shift is reported by about \n\n5% of the excited dye molecules in the TEOS-TMPS and TEOS-APTES samples, 10% \n\nin TEOS-GPTES, TEOS-PEG20k, and TEOS-GR samples, and 20% in TEOS-PEG300 \n\nsamples. This blue shift indicates that a significant fraction (5-20%) of the dye \n\nmolecules probes a slight decrease in the polarity of the host medium, favoured by \n\naging. This behaviour is not surprising since the chemical composition of the liquid \n\nphase changes throughout the aging process. It is expected that not only water (the main \n\ncomponent), but also some vestigial ethanol may remain in the liquid phase retained in \n\nthe pores, formed as a by-product of the polymerization of the silica network. Moreover, \n\nthe modifiers, a few remaining TEOS monomers, and other possible oligomers add to \n\nthe complexity of the liquid-phase chemical composition. \n\n 93\n\n\n\n \n\n500 550 600 650 700\n-0,1\n\n0,0\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\n0,4\n\n0,5\n\n0,6 TEOS-TMPS\n\nin\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nau\n\n)\n\nwavelength (nm)\n\nday 0\n\nday 45\nday 36\nday 29\nday 21\nday 15\nday 5\n\n500 550 600 650 700\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nin\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nau\n\n)\n\nwavelength (nm)\n\nTEOS-PEG300 day 0\n\nday 47\nday 38\nday 31\nday 23\nday 18\nday 7\n\n500 550 600 650 700\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nin\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nau\n\n)\n\nwavelength (nm)\n\nTEOS-APTES\n\nday 0\n\nday 45\nday36\nday29\nday 21\nday 15\nday 5\n\n500 550 600 650 700\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\nin\n\nte\nns\n\nity\n (\n\nau\n)\n\nwavelength (nm)\n\nTEOS-PEG 20K day 0\n\nday 45\nday 37\nday 30\nday 22\nday 17\nday 6\n\n500 550 600 650 700\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nin\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nau\n\n)\n\nwavelength (nm)\n\nTEOS-GPTES\n\nday45\nday 36\nday 29\nday 21\nday15\nday 5\n\nday 0\n\n500 550 600 650 700\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nin\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nau\n\n)\n\nwavelength (nm)\n\nTEOS-GGR\n\nday 46\nday 37\nday 30\nday 23\nday 17\nday 6\n\nday 0\n\nFigure 5.13.

Figure 5.14 shows the Nile red SFS spectra just after gelation of the host media. \n\nThe spectra are shown normalised at each maximum, to emphasise environmental \n\nchanges, expressed by band position. Such methodology was adopted to overcome \n\nslight increases in the concentration of the entrapped species caused by matrix shrinkage \n\nover time. It is clear that Nile red is probing a very polar medium (with an \u201cequivalent\u201d \n\ndielectric constant in the order of 60, according to figure 4.7), most probably influenced \n\nby the high dielectric constant of the aqueous buffer solution, as expected at this early \n\nstage of the aging process, when the matrix network is still embedded in the initial \n\nsolvent medium. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.14. Normalised Nile red SFS data obtained with an offset of 20 nm, in the different host media. \n\n \n\nNile red SFS for each of the hosts was measured at regular intervals over an aging \n\nperiod of more than forty days. Figure 5.15 illustrates the shifts in the Nile red \n\nmaximum wavelength for each matrix as the aging progresses. In all cases, with the \n\nexception of the TMPS containing host, a red shift in the Nile red SFS occurs. It is \n\ninteresting to notice, that the change in the peak wavelength is consistent with matrix \n\nstabilisation occurring after twenty days. Using the Nile red SFS guide (figure 4.7) it is \n\npossible to make an estimate that Nile red is in a relatively polar hydrogen bond \n\ninfluenced environment (value 60-70), which is unsurprising if it is at the bulk oxide \n\npore interface within the sol-gel derived media. \n\n 95\n\n\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n610\n\n615\n\n620\n\n625\n\n630\n\npe\nak\n\n p\nos\n\niti\non\n\n / \nnm\n\ntime / days\n\n TMPS\n APTES\n GPTES\n PEG 300\n PEG 20K\n Gelrite\n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.15.

Moreover, it is generally \n\nobserved that the relative contributions of ?2 and ?3 components become more important \n\nas the aging progresses. \n\n  \n \n \n \n\n 96\n\n\n\n \n \n\nday ?1 (ns) ?2 (ns) ?3 (ns) ?1 ?2 ?3 ?2\n\n0 0.09 \u00b1 0.06 0.96 \u00b1 0.10 2.55 \u00b1 0.03 0.78 0.17 0.05 1.09 \n\n1 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 1.14 \u00b1 0.09 2.79 \u00b1 0.02 0.74 0.14 0.12 1.13 \n\n2 0.10 \u00b1 0.09 1.13 \u00b1 0.09 2.81 \u00b1 0.02 0.69 0.15 0.15 1.05 \n\n3 0.19 \u00b1 0.10 1.28 \u00b1 0.11 2.90 \u00b1 0.02 0.51 0.26 0.23 1.02 \n\n4 0.31 \u00b1 0.20 1.43 \u00b1 0.17 2.93 \u00b1 0.03 0.41 0.28 0.32 1.10 \n\n6 0.19 \u00b1 0.16 1.38 \u00b1 0.15 2.94 \u00b1 0.03 0.50 0.22 0.28 1.09 \n\n8 0.51 \u00b1 0.23 1.80 \u00b1 0.38 3.02 \u00b1 0.05 0.35 0.27 0.38 1.08 \n\n11 0.56 \u00b1 0.24 1.85 \u00b1 0.31 3.08 \u00b1 0.04 0.28 0.31 0.41 0.97 \n\n14 0.77 \u00b1 0.46 1.89 \u00b1 0.54 3.08 \u00b1 0.05 0.24 0.29 0.47 1.08 \n\n17 0.41 \u00b1 0.15 1.87 \u00b1 0.36 3.14 \u00b1 0.04 0.34 0.29 0.38 0.91 \n\n24 0.34 \u00b1 0.24 1.73 \u00b1 0.43 3.10 \u00b1 0.03 0.22 0.26 0.52 1.06 \n\n29 0.64 \u00b1 0.54 1.97 \u00b1 0.12 3.16 \u00b1 0.17 0.15 0.30 0.55 1.08 \n\n32 0.46 \u00b1 0.14 1.99 \u00b1 0.60 3.14 \u00b1 0.05 0.22 0.26 0.52 1.09 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.3.

From twenty days onwards all the \n\npolymer modified hosts (figure 5.16) apparently have equivalent average lifetimes, \n\nwhich is indicative that the viscosity sensed by DASPMI is similar within these media. \n\nThis is in contrast to the intensity data for the initial gelation step, thus indicating that \n\nthe main influence of the polymers occurs during the matrix forming phase, after which \n\nthey exhibit similar control. In the case of the silane modified systems there is more of a \n\nspread in the average lifetimes, showing that limited control can be exerted over the \n\nviscosity on longer timescales by selecting the appropriate silane. It is worth remember \n\nthat the fluorescence lifetimes obtained are about two orders of magnitude longer than \n\nthose obtained in non viscous solution [17].  \n\n \n\n 100\n\n\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n0,0\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\n2,0\n\n2,5\n\nav\ner\n\nag\ne \n\nlif\net\n\nim\ne \n\n(n\ns)\n\ntime (days)\n\n PEG 300\n PEG 20k\n Gelrite\n\n \nFigure 5.16.

Matrix characterization at the end of aging  \n\n \n\nIn this section the results obtained on the structural and morphological \n\ncharacterization of the matrices are presented. Firstly, figure 5.18 shows the X-ray \n\ndiffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples. These data indicate that the silica matrix is \n\nformed as an amorphous silicate hydrate usually referred to as opal, in all samples \n\nexcept the GPTES sample. Most probably the short range disorder of the silica network \n\nis higher in presence of this modifier as compared to the others thus precluding the \n\ndetection of the opal characteristic peak. These results suggest that, although in presence \n\n 101\n\n\n\nof a diversity of modifiers, the building of the network is mainly controlled by the sol-\n\ngel synthesis of the silica matrix. \n\n \n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\na.\n\nu.\n)\n\n2 Theta\n\n APTES\n GPTES\n TMPS\n\n \n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\na.\n\nu.\n)\n\n2 Theta\n\n PEG 300\n PEG 20k\n Gelrite\n\n \nFigure 5.18.

The first step is \n\ncharacterized by extensive and profound chemical and physical changes, namely the \n\nhydrolysis and the condensation of the silica network. During the aging process, \n\npolycondensation progresses with concomitant local solubilisation and re-precipitation \n\nevents, thereby causing a significant decrease in porosity and increase in mechanical \n\nstrength. The connectivity of the silica network increases substantially during this step. \n\nAs the syneresis (shrinkage) occurs, an important fraction of liquid is expelled from the \n\npores. Comparison between the two SiO2 samples confirms that aging induces a \n\ndecrease in the specific surface area (SBET), in the total volume of the pores (Vp) and \n\nalso in pore size (rm, and rb). Moreover the values found for rm and rb suggest these \n\n 103\n\n\n\nmatrices possess tubular/cylindrical pores that tend to shrink with aging as expected. It \n\nis important to note that the results on the modified matrices, shown in table 5.10, were \n\nobtained after the aging step, therefore on samples considered to be dry gels. \n\nComparison between the values of rm, and rb for SiO2 (aged) and the ensemble of the \n\nmodified samples show the general effect of the modifiers: not only the pores\u2019 size \n\nincrease but the shape of the pores becomes \u201cink-bottle-like\u201d. Moreover, the specific \n\nsurface area (SBET), and the total volume of the pores (Vp ) tend to increase upon \n\naddition of the modifier, except for PEG 300 where the opposite effect was \n\nunexpectedly observed. It is interesting to note that PEG 20k behaves in a similar way \n\nto the other modifiers. This specific effect observed with PEG 300 is ascribed to a more \n\neffective interaction of the hydroxyl groups of this polymer with the silica network, as \n\ncompared with the longer chained PEG 20k. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5. Conclusion \n \n\nTwo fluorescent probes, Nile red and DASPMI were used in monitoring the \n\nprofound changes that occur in sol-gel matrices during the gelation and aging stages. \n\nThe combination of such fluorescent dyes, made it possible to gain an insight into these \n\ndynamic systems. \n\nDuring the gelation process DASPMI exhibited a drastic enhancement in quantum \n\nyield related to the increasing viscosity through the sol to gel transition, caused by a \n\nreduction in the non-radiative pathways. During the aging time a high degree of scatter \n\nwas seen, in both the steady-state and time-resolved data, as DASPMI molecules \n\nencounter a range of different environments before the structure of the media becomes \n\nmore stable. The systems stability is observed from day 20 onward. Changes in the peak \n\nsteady-state emission most probably relate to alterations in the local polarity of the pore \n\nliquid, while the marked increase in intensity and lifetime values relate to decreased \n\nnonradiative de-excitation caused by increasing local viscosity. Nile red, in turn, reports \n\non the interface between the bulk oxide material and the internal pore structure. The \n\nSFS data showed an enhancement in the polarity through aging, strongly influenced by \n\n 104\n\n\n\nhydrogen bonding. In both cases the data revealed that, overall, the aging process \n\nstabilises from day 20 onward. \n\nTime-resolved measurements of DASPMI, made clear that the viscosity \n\nenhancement of the pore solvent, does not prevent the formation of the TICT state, \n\nwhich is favoured by the aging process. The complementary study on the photophysics \n\nof DASPMI in glycerol-water mixtures had provided evidence for the coexistence of \n\nhydrodynamic factors, where hydrogen bonding within the solvent cage inhibited the \n\nformation of the TICT state in this system. But in sol-gel systems studied, that was not \n\nthe case. \n\nComplementary FRAP and anisotropy measurements are in agreement and \n\nfurthermore suggest that the \u201cviscosity\u201d increase is primarily related to pore \n\ninterconnections. Making use of these techniques also shows the ability of the hosts to \n\nretain relatively large biomolecules (while allowing them restricted mobility) and \n\nallows the free diffusion of smaller molecules.  \n\nFinally, the results obtained from the BET measurements, although not directly \n\nrelated to the FRAP and time resolved measurements, nevertheless, corroborate the \n\nhypothesis present in this section.  \n\nThese important considerations are fundamental in the usage of sol-gel hybrid \n\nmedia for biosensor applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 105\n\n\n\n5.6.

Introduction \n\n \nThe previous chapter presented the methods and techniques utilised to monitor \n\nsilica matrices through the sol to gel transition and the aging process. The present \n\nchapter will focus on assessing the conformational stability and activity of two different \n\ncatalytically active proteins encapsulated within these hosts. Hybrid sol-gel media, with \n\neither polymers or silanes to moderate the internal pore environment, were produced \n\ncontaining subtilisin Carlsberg or cytochrome c. Subtilisin Carlsberg is a member of \n\nthe superfamily of subtilisin-like serine proteases (subtilases) occurring in Archaea, \n\nBacteria, Fungi and higher eukariotes [1]. It has been systematically characterised and \n\nthe complete aminoacid sequence of the mature protein is known since 1968 [2]. \n\nApplications of proteolitic enzymes include drug delivery [3,4], food industry, laundry \n\ndetergents [5] and organic synthesis [6]. C-type cytochromes are found in almost all \n\norganisms, and are involved in electron transport [7]. In eukariotes, it is synthesised in \n\nthe cytoplasm, but is in the inner-membrane space of the mitochondria organelle that it \n\ngains its haem moiety.  Its most carefully studied function is as an electron carrier of the \n\neukaryotic respiratory chain, but it is also important in both apoptosis and oxidative \n\nstress. The peroxidase activity of this electron carrier is associated with the iron of the \n\nhaem group  [8]. \n\n 109\n\n\n\nThe encapsulated proteins exhibited activity over a forty day period, during which \n\nhost aging occurred. The modifiers were characterised in chapter 5 and their structure is \n\npresented in figure 5.11.  \n\nThe highly solvatochromic dye Nile red was used in conjunction with \n\nsynchronous scan fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) to elucidate changes in the tertiary \n\nstructure of the proteins, upon incorporation into sol\u2013gel derived media. By examining \n\nthis and the catalytic reaction (initial velocity and amount of substrate transformed into \n\nproduct) it was possible to ascertain the influence of the different hosts on the catalytic \n\nrate. It is clear that, although some unfolding of the proteins occurred, the major effect \n\non the catalytic reaction is that of mass transport within the host. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2. Encapsulation and activity of subtilisin Carlsberg \n\n \n6.2.1. Materials and methods \n \n\nAll spectra (absorption and synchronous scan fluorescence) were measured with \n\nthe instruments mentioned in chapter 3. Difference spectra were calculated by \n\nnormalising the spectra and subtracting from the reference spectrum. \n\nSols were manufactured as reported in section 5.2.1. Subtilisin Carlsberg (EC \n\n3.4.21.62) from Sigma, was dissolved in phosphate buffer solution pH7 to a \n\nconcentration of 1.5x10-5 M and was labelled with Nile red by continuous stirring at \n\nroom temperature for 2 hours. This gave a molar ratio of 1 dye molecule to 15 \n\nmolecules of enzyme. The hybrid hosts were then manufactured using 10 mm \n\npathlength polystyrene cuvettes (ca. 4.5 ml volume) by taking 2 ml of sol and adding \n\nsilane or polymer, and 2 ml of the enzyme solution. The modifiers were presented in the \n\nprevious chapter. After combining the selected sol and enzyme solution, the resultant \n\ngel was stored at 4 \u00baC between measurements with the top of the cuvette covered. Under \n\nthese conditions an average shrinkage of ca. 40% occurred over the period of the \n\nexperiment.  \n\n 110\n\n\n\nCatalytic experiments used the enzyme substrate Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methyl \n\ncoumarin  (AAF-AMC) (Aldrich) and the product formation, amido-4-methyl coumarin \n\n(AMC) was followed spectrophotometrically [9].  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2.2. Results and discussion \n\n \nAn important aim of the entrapment of biologically active molecules is that the \n\nhost can provide a protective environment for the biomolecules under conditions such \n\nthat their activity is preserved. In the present section the studies on the enzyme \n\nconformation are reported, through the analysis of the fluorescence spectroscopy of Nile \n\nRed as the aging of the matrices proceeds.  The enzymatic activity of subtilisin \n\nCarlsberg incorporated into different sol-gel derived media is also reported. In order to \n\nprovide a reference, the catalytic reaction was also studied in aqueous solution (pH7). \n\nThis reference study was carried out under conditions (i.e. concentration of substrate) \n\nsimilar to the study of subtilisin Carlsberg activity when incorporated into the chosen \n\nmatrices. It should be stressed that all the catalytic and spectroscopic measurements \n\nwere done during the period of wet aging. In fact, in chapter 4 it was shown that the \n\nactual pore size of the wet-gels is such that the enzyme has ample space to rotate, thus \n\nproviding adequate conditions to probe the enzyme\u2019s activity, a major purpose of the \n\npresent work. \n\n \n\n6.2.2.1. Catalytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg in homogeneous solution \n\n(reference system) \n\nThe reaction mechanism of subtilisin Carlsberg is well established, as serine \n\nproteases belong to the most comprehensively studied class of proteolytic enzymes [10]. \n\nThe catalytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg was examined using the substrate Ala-Ala-\n\nPhe-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (AAF-AMC) and monitoring the formation of the \n\nproduct 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (AMC).  \n\nAccording to Kamal et al. [9] the enzymatic reaction is described by the following \n\nmechanism: \n\n \n\nAMCSCSCAMCAAFSCAMCAAF k\nk\n\nk +????????+?\n?\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1   (6.1) \n\n 111\n\n\n\nwhere AAF-AMC\u2014SC is the enzyme-substrate complex.

In equation 6.2, [ ]TSC refers to the total concentration of enzyme, \n\nKM is the Michaelis constant and k2 is the rate of decomposition of the enzyme-substrate \n\ncomplex into product and enzyme. \n\nThe concentration of both the substrate Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin \n\n(AAF-AMC) and the product (AMC) was determined spectrophotometricaly at 325 nm \n\nand 370 nm, respectively, according to the absorption spectra of both species, shown in \n\nfigure 6.1. \n\n \n\n2 5 0 3 0 0 3 5 0 4 0 0 4 5 0\n0 .0\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .8\n\n1 .0\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\nis\ned\n\n a\nbs\n\nor\nba\n\nnc\ne\n\nW a v e le n g th  (n m )\n\n A A F - A M C\n A M C\n\n?\n3 7 0  \n\n=  7 .6  m M -1  c m -1\n\n \nFigure 6.1.

The slope obtained from figure 6.3, 3.4x10-3 s-1 is in agreement \n\nwith the corresponding value k\u2019=2.4x10-3 s-1 predicted from Kamal\u2019s data when \n\n = 1.3 x 10[ AMCAAF ? -4 M. \n \n\n \n\n6.2.2.2. Catalytic activity of entrapped subtilisin Carlsberg \n\nThe catalytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg in sol-gel derived matrices was \n\nmonitored under experimental conditions equivalent to the ones used in the solution \n\nstudy, by cutting a slice of ca. 200 mg of matrix and putting it into a cuvette with \n\nsubstrate solution. This means that, in each reaction vessel, a total amount of ca. 0.1 mg \n\nof enzyme was present.  The low enzyme loading, ca. 0.05 wt%, was deliberate so that \n\nwas always in excess relative to[ AMCAAF ? [ ]SC . From figure 6.3 it is possible to \n\n 114\n\n\n\nestimate the reaction rate, in homogeneous medium, that corresponds to the enzyme \n\nload used in the matrices in the present case is 5.24x10-5 s-1. \n\nAs previously pointed out, all the catalytic measurements were done during the \n\nperiod of wet aging, so that the actual pore size of the wet-gels is such that the enzyme \n\nhas ample space to rotate, thus providing adequate conditions to probe the enzyme\u2019s \n\nactivity. Moreover, it has been shown in the previous chapter that the stabilization of \n\nthese sol-gel matrices occurs only after 20 days. As a result, the activity of subtilisin \n\nCarlsberg was monitored in wet gels after an aging period of two months. The [ ] \nversus time curves shown in figure 6.4, when compared to the corresponding curves \n\nmeasured for the reference system (figure 6.2), indicate that the enzymatic process, \n\nalthough occurring, is much slower when subtilisin Carlsberg is entrapped. Moreover \n\nsignificant activity occurs only after an \u201cinduction period\u201d, of duration quite dependent \n\nupon the modifier. It is shorter for Gelrite and PEG 20 K and longer for TMPS and \n\nAPTES matrices. \n\nAMC\n\n \n\n \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0,00000\n\n0,00001\n\n0,00002\n\n0,00003\n\n0,00004\n\n0,00005\n\n0,00006\n\n0,00007 Gelrite\n\nPEG20k\n\nPEG300\n\nGPTES\n\nTMPS\n\nC\non\n\nce\nnt\n\nra\ntio\n\nn \nof\n\n A\nM\n\nC\n (\n\nM\n)\n\nTime (minutes)\n\nAPTES\n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.4. Catalytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg within sol-gel media after an aging period of 2 \n\nmonths.  \n\n \n\n \n\n 115\n\n\n\nSeveral approaches have been developed to the study of the kinetics of enzymatic \n\nreactions when incorporated into complex systems such as living cells or heterogeneous \n\nmedia such as nanostructures [12-15]. Considerable attention was paid to enzymatic \n\nprocesses that follow the Michaelis \u2013 Menten mechanism [14,15] \n\n \n\nPSEES k\nk\n\nk ???????+\n?\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1      (6.5) \n\n \n\nAccording to these authors [14] their simulation studies indicate that, under these \n\ncircumstances, k1 shows a time dependence whereas k-1 and k2 are time independent. \n\nThese results confirm that in spatially constrained media k1 is unequivocally affected, \n\ne.g., k1 becomes time dependent. \n\nAccording to Kopelman [16,17] the time dependence of the rate constant can be \n\nadequately described by the fractal like kinetics: \n\n \nhtktk ?= 0)(   for t??     (6.6) \n\n \n\nwhere k0 is the rate constant in absence of constraints, and h is the fractal dimension. \n\n \n\nIn the present study, since the enzyme is trapped into the matrix, the accessibility \n\nof the substrate to the pores that retain the enzyme is somewhat inhibited. Therefore it is \n\nexpected that the access to the enzyme will control the kinetics with obvious time \n\ndependent effects on k1. Under these circumstances it was assumed that the enzymatic \n\nprocess becomes a pseudo\u2013first order process \n\n \n\nAMCAMCAAF k????     (6.7) \n\n \n\nWhere k = k(t) obeys equation (6.6).

These results suggest the \n\nneed to develop in future new models and simulations that approach these materials in a \n\nmore realist way, albeit at the expenses of added complexity [18]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 117\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n[19-03-2009 11:39 \"/TMPS-\" (2454909)]\nLinear Regression for TMPS_B:\nY = A + B * X\nParameter Value Error\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA -12.915 0.07247\nB 1.65378 0.01189\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR SD N P\n------------------------------------------------------------\n0.99487 0.13425 202&lt;0.0001\n\nlnTime (min)\n\nLn\n(L\n\nn(\nS\n\n0/\nS\n\nt)\n)\n\n ln(lnS0/St)\n Linear Fit of TMPS_B\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n[19-03-2009 11:33 \"/GPTES-\" (2454909)]\nLinear Regression for GPTES_B:\nY = A + B * X\nParameter Value Error\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA -9.40641 0.05325\nB 1.21101 0.00882\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR SD N P\n------------------------------------------------------------\n0.9946 0.121 207&lt;0.0001\n\nlnTime (min)\n\nLn\n(L\n\nn(\nS\n\n0/\nS\n\nt)\n)\n\n ln(lnS0/St)\n Linear Fit of GPTES_B\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nlnTime (min)\n\nLn\n(L\n\nn(\nS\n\n0/\nS\n\nt)\n)\n\n19-03-2009 12:19 \"/peg20k-\" (2454909)]\nLinear Regression for peg20k_B:\nY = A + B * X\nParameter Value Error\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA -7.35232 0.04498\nB q0.96901 0.00745\n------------------------------------------------------------\nR SD N P\n------------------------------------------------------------\n0.99399 0.1022 207&lt;0.0001\n\n ln(lnS0/St)\n Linear Fit of peg20k_B\n\n3 4 5 6 7\n-10\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nlnTime (min)\n\nLn\n(L\n\nn(\nS\n\n0/\nS\n\nt)\n)\n\n19-03-2009 11:33 \"/aptes-\" (2454909)]\nLinear Regression for APTES_B:\nY = A + B * X\n\nParameter Value Error\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA -12.75933 0.10103\nB 1.57711 0.01664\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR SD N P\n------------------------------------------------------------\n0.98895 0.20003 204&lt;0.0001\n\n ln(lnS0/St)\n Linear Fit of APTES_B\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nLinear Regression for gelrite_B:\nY = A + B * X\nParameter Value Error\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA -8.27428 0.03707\nB 1.16968 0.00614\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR SD N P\n------------------------------------------------------------\n0.99719 0.08424 207&lt;0.0001\n\nlnTime (min)\n\nLn\n(L\n\nn(\nS\n\n0/\nS\n\nt)\n)\n\n ln(lnS0/St)\n Linear Fit of gelrite_B\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nlnTime (min)\n\nLn\n(L\n\nn(\nS\n\n0/\nS\n\nt)\n)\n\n[19-03-2009 11:44 \"/peg300-\" (2454909)]\nLinear Regression for peg300_B:\nY = A + B * X\nParameter Value Error\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA -8.13693 0.07246\nB 1.04607 0.01201\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR SD N P\n------------------------------------------------------------\n0.98677 0.16465 207&lt;0.0001\n\n ln(lnS0/St)\n Linear Fit of peg300_B\n\nFigure 6.5.

Enzyme conformation during aging \n\nThe enzyme\u2019s conformation was monitored by analysing the synchronous \n\nfluorescence scan spectra (SFS) of the extrinsic fluorescent probe Nile red, as explained \n\npreviously. As a preliminary study, subtilisin Carlsberg (SC) was deliberately \n\ndenatured with urea to elucidate the SFS spectrum of Nile red in presence of the \n\nunfolded species. The enzyme and Nile red were mixed in buffer solution (pH 7) and \n\nthe incubation proceeded for 2 hours with continuous gentle stirring prior to \n\nmeasurement (figure 6.6, solid line). Urea was then added to the enzyme solution and, \n\nafter dissolving, the spectrum was re-measured (figure 6.6, dotted line). It is evident \n\nfrom figure 6.6, that treatment with urea causes an enhancement of the fluorescence \n\nintensity at 625 nm. Emission at this wavelength corresponds to Nile red sensing a more \n\naqueous (polar) environment, which is attributed to unfolding of the protein. The \n\nconcentration of urea used, 4 M, is not enough to completely denature SC (it retains ca. \n\n35% relative hydrolysis activity)[19], although a certain degree of unfolding is expected \n\ndue to solvation of the hydrophobic core [20].The synchronous scan fluorescence \n\nspectra clearly reveal that, after urea treatment, the probe senses a more polar \n\nenvironment, with the Nile red band intensity at 625 nm increasing dramatically, \n\naccompanied by a red shift of 4 nm. The same technique was utilised to monitor the \n\nconformation of SC encapsulated in the sol-gel modified monoliths.  \n\n   \n\n500 550 600 650 700\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\n35000\n\n40000\n\nx5In\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n)\n\nExcitation wavelength (nm)\n\n after incubation\n after treatment with urea\n\n \n \nFigure 6.6. Nile red synchronous scan fluorescence spectra in solution immediately after incubation with \n\nSC (solid line) and after treatment with urea (dotted line). A massive increase in the intensity along with a \n\n4 nm red shift of the spectrum after urea treatment should be noted. \n\n 119\n\n\n\nAfter the encapsulation in sol-gel derived media, the SFS technique was used to \n\nfollow changes in the enzyme\u2019s conformation during the aging period. The difference \n\nspectra were generated by normalising the spectra and subtracting the reference (day 0) \n\nspectrum using Microcal Origin 7 software (figure 6.8). \n\nIt is assumed throughout that, after encapsulation, Nile red does not leach to any \n\nappreciable extent from the enzyme and that the enhancement of the band at 630nm is \n\nattributed to protein unfolding, exposing the probe to a more aqueous environment. This \n\nhappens at the expenses of the band at 600nm. The enhancement in each sample varies \n\nbetween 35% and 40%, except for TMPS sample where it reaches 10%, indicating that \n\nthis host is the one that better preserves the enzyme integrity. This then leads to the \n\nquestion of what is the meaning of the band at 550nm or lower wavelengths that appears \n\nin both the APTES and TMPS samples. As Nile red is a very hydrophobic probe, \n\nchanges in its surroundings could force some molecules to relocate to less polar \n\npositions. Also, the quantum yield of Nile red in non polar environments is higher than \n\nin polar ones, so the fluorescence intensity of the relocated molecules is relatively \n\nenhanced. Favourable effect of TMPS addition to silica matrices has previously been \n\nreported on myoglobin conformation [21]. \n\nOverall, these results show that the confinement in sol-gel derived media does not \n\nlead to any significant denaturing of SC; moreover the results suggest a favourable \n\neffect of TMPS addition on SC conformation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 120\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n450 500 550 600 650 700\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\nIn\n\nte\nns\n\nity\n (\n\nco\nun\n\nts\n)\n\nExcitation wavelength (nm)\n\n day 0\n day 1\n day 8\n day 17\n day 25\n day 32\n day 43\n\nAPTES\n\n450 500 550 600 650 700\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n)\n\nExcitation wavelength (nm)\n\n day 0\n day 1\n day 9\n day 16\n day 27\n day 38\n\nGelrite\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.8.

Encapsulation and activity of cytochrome c \n\n \n6.3.1. Materials and methods \n\n \nCytochrome c (horse heart, Aldrich) was either used as received or labelled with \n\nNile red by taking 0.3 mg of protein in 2 ml of phosphate buffer solution (pH7) and \n\nincubating with 2 \u00b5l of 10-3 M  Nile red solution in dimethylsulfoxide for one hour. The \n\ncytochrome c activity was obtained from the oxidation of ABTS (2,2-Azino-bis(3-\n\nethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, (from Sigma) by hydrogen \n\nperoxide (H2O2, 37% Aldrich) [8]. The sol-gel derived media manufacturing process \n\nwas described previously (section 6.2.1). All measurements (described in chapter 3) \n\nwere performed at ambient temperature and taken over a 40 day period to check for \n\nlonger term changes during sol\u2013gel aging.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.2. Results and discussion \n\n \nActivity measurements in aqueous solution served as reference to the \n\nmeasurements involving the sol\u2013gel matrices and were performed using differing \n\nquantities of cytochrome with a fixed substrate concentration. For the studies on the \n\nsol\u2013gel derived systems, 100 mg of matrix (a slice cut from the monolith) was taken and \n\nadded to a cuvette containing 2 ml of 2.5\u00d710?5 M ABTS and 8 \u00b5l H2O2 in buffer \n\nsolution. The absorption spectrum was recorded in the range 250\u2013500 nm, both before \n\nthe addition of the matrix and after the kinetic study was complete. The progress curves \n\nwere built either on the addition of the cytochrome c or protein containing matrix and \n\nfollowed the formation of the ABTS?+ radical by monitoring absorption changes at 414 \n\nnm [22]. The peroxidase activity of cytochrome c shows a typical Michaelis\u2013Menten \n\nkinetics for H2O2 [8].   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 122\n\n\n\n6.3.2.1. Catalytic activity of cytochrome c in homogeneous solution (reference \n\nsystem) \n\nThe reaction of H2O2 with cytochrome c, produces a highly reactive ferryl-haem \n\nspecies, the intermediate compound I which, by reduction with ABTS, regenerates the \n\noriginal cytochrome c molecule [8]. In agreement to Deere et al. [23] cytochrome c \n\nmediates the oxidation of ABTS, with one mole of H2O2 reacting with two moles of \n\nABTS, according to equations 6.10 and 6.11. \n\n \n\n( ) OHIcompoundOHIIIFeccytochrome 222 +?+   (6.10) \n\n \n\n( ) +\u2022+?+ ABTSIIIFeccytochromeABTSIcompound 22   (6.11) \n\n \n\nFor the catalytic reaction a fixed concentration of H2O2 and ABTS were used, at \n\nvarious protein concentrations, in a range similar to that expected in the hosts. The \n\nformation of the ABTS?+ radical was monitored at 414 nm with time, using absorption \n\nspectroscopy (figure 6.9). \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.9. Catalytic activity in solution, with fixed substrate and H2O2 concentrations and varying \n\namounts of cytochrome c. The product formation was monitored at 415 nm. \n\n \n\nFrom these progress curves, the initial rate (v0) of the catalytic reaction was calculated \n\nby taking the derivative [24]. The values obtained are given in table 6.2 and show that \n\nthe initial rate of the reaction is proportional to the protein concentration. The initial \n\n 123\n\n\n\nreaction rate (v0) was chosen, as determination of other kinetic parameters can be \n\nproblematic in sol-gel derived media [24,25]. The reaction forming the ABTS?+ radical \n\nis reversible, through a complex mechanism [25], so longer time course measurements \n\nwere precluded. Curve A in figure 6.9, shows an initial rapid increase, followed by a \n\ndecrease (also observed in some of the other kinetic curves) which relates to the \n\nreversibility of this reaction. It was expected that the results would be obtained in a \n\nregime where the substrate would be in excess in relation to cytochrome c.  \n\n \n\n \n\n[cytochrome c] / M v0 / Ms\n-1\n\n9.6 x 10-9 2.36 x 10-8\n\n2.4 x 10-8 3.33 x 10-8\n\n4.8 x 10-8 2.63 x 10-8\n\n9.6 x 10-8 5.70 x 10-8\n\n2.4 x 10-7 1.33 x 10-7\n\n4.8 x 10-7 2.53 x 10-7\n\n \nTable 6.2.

Catalytic activity of entrapped cytochrome c \n\nComparing the values for the initial velocity from the sol-gel hosts over a period \n\nof approximately 40 days (figure 6.10), these media exhibit v0 values one to two orders \n\nof magnitude lower than that seen in the solution data (table 6.2). An example of the \n\nkinetic curves for the formation of the ABTS?+ radical at various points during the \n\naging process, in this case APTES, is given in figure 6.11. This shows that the amount \n\nof radical formed over the period of the experiment is similar in magnitude to the lower \n\nconcentrations of cytochrome c employed in the solution study. \n\nThere is a general trend for the amount of radical formed during the time of the \n\nexperiment to reduce with aging time. To perform these measurements slices taken from \n\na monolith were used rather than powders, and this could partially explain the low v0\u2019s \n\nobtained. Other explanations that need exploring are unfolding of the protein and its \n\naccessibility within the host to the substrate. The fact that a charged radical is formed in \n\n 124\n\n\n\nthe reaction and that it has to exit the matrix before it is detected spectroscopically is \n\nalso an issue. Considering the whole of the dataset shown in figure 6.10, it is evident \n\nthat there is a trend for the initial velocity to decrease with aging time. \n\n \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0,0\n\n2,0x10-10\n\n4,0x10-10\n\n6,0x10-10\n\n8,0x10-10\n\n1,0x10-9\n\n1,2x10-9\n\n1,4x10-9\n\n1,6x10-9\n\n1,8x10-9\n\nv 0\n (\n\nM\ns-\n\n1 )\n\ntime  (days)\n\n APTES\n GPTES\n TMPS\n\n1,8x10-9\n\n \n\nFigure 6.10.

Comparison of Nile red difference SFS in cytochrome c with sol-gel aging time when \n\nincorporated into both silane and polymer modified hosts. \n\n 126\n\n\n\nThis was assessed using synchronous scan difference spectra, which were \n\ngenerated by normalising the synchronous scan spectra for the different matrices and \n\nsubtracting from the initial spectrum taken after gelation.  \n\nGenerally the data in figure 6.11 show that there is a decrease in the main band (in \n\nthe region 600 nm to 620 nm) and relative increases at both shorter (ca. 560 nm and \n\nbelow) and longer (ca. 635 nm) wavelengths. The fact that in the region of the dominant \n\nband the difference spectra exhibit both an increase and decrease along with a cross \n\nover point is indicative that this band is probably the sum of two or more component \n\nspectra, with Nile red located in distinct, reasonably polar microenvironments. The \n\ndegree of spectral change appears dependent on the modifying agent. Tentatively the \n\nlonger wavelength increase can indicate an opening of the protein structure exposing the \n\nprobe to an increased polarity. This may relate to some denaturing of the protein (or \n\neven a small degree of probe leaching), however in comparison to the effect of adding \n\nurea to cytochrome c in solution (data not shown), the degree of denaturing appears low. \n\n It should also be noted that absorption spectra taken at the end of the study period \n\nshowed the presence of the haem Soret band in all of the samples at 407 nm indicating \n\nthe retention of protein within the hosts. This wavelength is close to that we observe in \n\nsolution (408 nm) and indicates that the protein is hydrated [26] and should be \n\nfunctional within the hosts. Also the loading used (0.01 wt %) should be low enough to \n\navoid protein aggregation, although higher loading on silicate materials can be obtained \n\n[23]. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.2.4. Correlation between spectral and catalytic data \n\nIn order to help explain the results in the previous sections we have explored the \n\npossibility that there exists a connection between the SFS and initial velocity data. The \n\npossible factors that we can envisage to explain the catalytic activity data are changes in \n\nthe protein structure and access of the substrate to the protein. The former relates to the \n\ncytochrome itself, while the latter is more influenced by the host. If it is assumed that \n\nincreases in the SFS 635 nm band and decreases in the 600\u2013615 nm band are assigned \n\nto unfolding of the protein, it should be possible to use the relative importance of the \n\n600\u2013615 nm band as a measure of protein conformation changes. We advance this \n\nhypothesis, as previous studies of cytochrome c in sol-gel derived media, making use of \n\n 127\n\n\n\ncircular dichroism, have shown the ability of this protein to unfold and refold within the \n\nmatrix structure [27]. \n\nConsidering the first (just after gelation) and final measurements, then any \n\ndifference between these values should reflect the influence of the host. Table 6.3 shows \n\nthat, overall, the reduction in v0 is significantly higher than the reduction exhibited by \n\nthe 600\u2013615 nm band. This difference is most dramatic for the TMPS modified host, \n\nwhich, according to the present hypothesis, means that although this matrix appears \n\nsuitable for retaining the cytochrome c conformation (relatively small changes in SFS \u2013 \n\nfigure 6.11), it provides poor accessibility for the cytochrome to react with the ABTS \n\nand hydrogen peroxide. Both the GTPES and PEG 300 modified hosts show the next \n\nbiggest difference between our two chosen parameters, with the other modified media \n\nexhibiting similar differences. \n\n \n\nAdditive % reduction in v0\naverage decrease per day in v0  \n\n(x 10-12 Ms-1) \n\n% reduction in SFS \n\nband 600-620 nm \n\nAPTES 62 9.4 37 \n\nGPTES 65 9.4 20 \n\nTMPS 98 7.5 8 \n\nPEG 300 87 16.5 (6.9)* 34 \n\nPEG 20K 86 20.4 (2.8)* 67 \n\nGelrite 51 6.9 26 \n\n \nTable 6.3. Comparison of the reduction in v0 (in relation to the first activity measurement) with that of the \n\nSFS band situated between 600 and 620 nm (in relation to the spectra measured just after gelation) for the \n\nlast dataset for the differently modified media. The decrease in v0 obtained from a linear fit to all the data \n\nis also given to provide an indication of the average decrease per day over the study period. (*)The \n\nbracketed number was obtained omitting day 1 data points. \n\n \n\nWhen combining all the data, these observations allow us to suggest that the \n\nGelrite modified host appears to exhibit the most promising properties probably related \n\nto the templating properties of this polysaccharide [28]. This approach shows that it is \n\npossible to make a good comparison, making use of Nile SFS and activity \n\nmeasurements, between the modified sol\u2013gel derived media. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 128\n\n\n\n6.4. Conclusion \n\n \nSol-gel derived hosts, containing either polymers or silanes to moderate the \n\ninternal structure and pore environment, were produced containing subtilisin Carlsberg \n\nand cytochrome c. \n\nBy examining protein change conformation via Nile red synchronous fluorescence \n\nspectroscopy (SFS), it appears that no major unfolding of the proteins happens upon \n\nincorporation. However, during the aging time considered, the protein structure alters \n\nand this effect is seemingly influenced by the host. For cytochrome c, the sample with \n\nTMPS gave the most promising results(see table 6.3 that reports the highest decrease in \n\nthe reaction rate!), with Nile red SFS difference spectra showing as much as 8% \n\nalteration. The opposite effect was obtained with PEG samples with significant changes \n\nof about 67%. Nile red SFS difference spectra of the samples with subtilisin Carlsberg \n\ngave very similar results. Apparently TMPS has beneficial influence on the protein \n\nstructure as difference spectra show an alteration of only 10%. All other samples \n\nshowed a difference of about 40%. This could be related to the hydrophobic character of \n\nthe modifier (through the propyl group) and also to a more stable environment through \n\naging, as probed by Nile red SFS in TMPS sample without protein. It was shown (figure \n\n5.15) that the probe reports on a relatively constant polarity, during aging time. \n\nThe incorporated proteins exhibited catalytic activity in all the media over a forty \n\nday period, in which host aging occurred. The catalytic activity was inferior to that \n\nexhibited in solution one to two orders of magnitude and diminished with time. Polymer \n\ndoped hosts fare better in terms of catalytic activity, with the best results obtained with \n\nGelrite\u00ae. This was confirmed with an activity study over a prolonged timescale using \n\nsubtilisin Carlsberg, which also suggest that the substrate may be in default inside the \n\nmatrices pores, thus affecting the reaction kinetics. It is possible that although the bulk \n\nsubstrate concentration is in excess relatively to the encapsulated enzyme, the \n\nconcentration inside the pores may not observe this premise, resulting in atypical \n\nprogress curves. Complementary theoretical studies applied to enzymatic Michaelis\u2013\n\nMenten mechanisms confirm that the true morphology of the sol-gel matrix is complex, \n\nwith a variability of patterns at different scales. \n\nIt is clear that, although some unfolding of the proteins occurs, the major effect on \n\nthe catalytic reaction is that of mass transport within the host. \n\n 129\n\n\n\n6.5.

It also demonstrates \n\nthat it is possible to retain an enzyme\u2019s catalytic activity for several weeks which is an \n\nimportant achievement for use in biosensor applications. \n\nEven though sol-gel derived media based on producing a pure SiO2 bulk oxide \n\nmatrix have been employed for protein encapsulation, recent research has shown that it \n\ncan be advantageous to modify the reaction procedure to make the resulting host more \n\namenable. With this in mind, we focused on manufacturing organically modified silanes \n\nand polymer doped matrices to host different proteins with catalytic activity. The \n\nchosen additives not only contribute to template the pores, but also provide \n\nbiocompatibility, by controlling the internal pore environment and/or by modifying the \n\nwaterpool-bulk oxide interface of the host. Cytochrome c and subtilisin Carlsberg were \n\nsuccessfully incorporated into modified sol\u2013gel derived hosts in absence of major \n\nstructural changes. The protein conformation was indirectly monitored via the use of \n\nNile red synchronous fluorescence spectra (SFS) a technique that allowed changes in \n\nmicropolarity to be sensed, and thus to follow changes in the integrity of the \n\nbiomolecule structure. This hydrophobic dye probes different environments within the \n\nprotein and does not leach to any appreciable extent into the matrix pores. Combining \n\nthe two sets of data (Nile red SFS and catalytic rates), made it possible to discriminate \n\n 133\n\n\n\nbetween changes attributed to alterations in the protein conformation and effects from \n\nthe mass transport restrictions ascribed to the aging of the host. The matrices exhibited \n\ngood optical quality thus allowing for the spectroscopic monitoring. \n\nIn general the initial reaction rate becomes about one to two orders of magnitude \n\nlower upon encapsulation as compared with solution measurements. The access to the \n\nenzyme appears to become more restricted with aging time, possibly related to closure \n\nof the pores and decreased interconnectivity. \n\nThe modifiers used in the present work enabled the adjustment of the sol-gel \n\nreaction to host the enzyme from different standpoints. The polysaccharide Gelrite\u00ae \n\nwidens the three-dimensional network at early stages of the sol-gel process and PEG \n\nallows better diffusion of reactants. The silanes APTES, GPTES and TMPS modulate \n\nchemically the interior of the pore and do not substantially alter its diameter. Our data \n\npoint to the following: \n\n\u2022 The silane additive TMPS has a more favourable effect on the conformation of \n\nsubtilisin Carlsberg, and GPTES is more beneficial to cytochrome c integrity. \n\nThis can be related with the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the pore \n\ninduced by the modifier. The protein conformation was accessed by monitoring \n\nNile red synchronous fluorescence spectra. Regarding the catalytic \n\nmeasurements, TMPS and GPTES matrices gave poor results for both proteins. \n\nIt is apparent that, although the structure of the biomolecules is intact, the \n\ndiffusion within TMPS and GPTES hosts is severely affected. \n\n\u2022 Detailed studies on the enzymatic process of subtilisin Carlsberg (Michaelis\u2013\n\nMenten mechanism) in aged matrices confirm that the true morphology of the \n\nsol-gel matrix is complex, with a variability of patterns at different scales. It is \n\nclear that, although some unfolding of the proteins occurs, the major effect on \n\nthe catalytic reaction is that of mass transport within the host. \n\n\u2022 Measurements of the catalytic activity, as reflected by the initial velocity, \n\nshowed a reduction during the aging process, in cytochrome c matrices. This \n\neffect was ascribed mainly to mass transport increased restrictions, as the \n\nbuilding of the silica matrix progresses. In general, the polymers PEG and \n\nGelrite permit better diffusion of reactants inside the sol-gel hosts. The charge of \n\nthe reactants could also be influential; in the present case, the reaction product of \n\ncytochrome c catalysed reaction is a positively charged radical (ABTS?+) that \n\ncould be delayed or trapped due to the negatively charged walls of the pores. \n\n 134\n\n\n\nThis is an area in which further effort may provide help in understanding the \n\ninteraction between the different entities introduced in this study. The ideal host \n\nhas to conciliate both the shrinkage resistance during aging and the pore \n\nhydrophobicity to preserve the protein folding, while permitting the free passage \n\nof reactants.  \n\n \n\nThe choice of fluorescent probes is of great importance if the system is to be \n\nmonitored via fluorescence techniques. Here we made use of the viscosity and polarity \n\nsensitive fluorescence probes DASPMI and Nile red respectively, to monitor the host \n\ngelation and aging processes of the modified matrices. Time-correlated single-photon \n\ncounting fluorescence spectroscopy of DASPMI was used to study the alterations in the \n\npore viscosity with aging time. \n\nThe gelation (as probed by DASPMI emission) was found to be a two step \n\nprocess, which, by silane or polymer addition slows down by an order of magnitude as \n\ncompared to non-doped media. The main influence of the polymers occurs during the \n\nmatrix forming phase, after which they exhibit similar control. The lifetimes obtained \n\nfor silane-doped hosts showed that these additives exert limited control over the \n\nviscosity on longer timescales. During aging, the microviscosity increases, but the pore \n\nenvironment stabilises only after a period of 20 days. Nile red reported on the polarity \n\nwithin the pores via synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS). Overall, the polarity \n\nincreases as aging progresses and the results suggest the occurrence of hydrogen bonds \n\nat the bulk oxide pore interface. \n\nThe fact that Nile red is not covalently linked with the proteins means that the \n\nglobal movements of the biomolecule are difficult to assess. A fixed linkage between \n\nprobe and protein is preferable in elucidating the motion of biomolecules within the \n\nhost, with aging time. This was achieved with the covalent dyes Alexa Fluor 488 and \n\nfluorescein isothyocyanate (FITC), using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching \n\nexperiments (FRAP) and fluorescence lifetime anisotropy measurements. These \n\ntechniques proved complementary in monitoring the dynamics of sol-gel hybrid \n\nsystems, namely the proteins\u2019 rotation and ability to diffuse within the matrix. \n\nRotational diffusion is related to the environment inside the pore, while translational \n\ndiffusion is related to the pore interconnections. In terms of the effective viscosity \n\nsensed by the probes Alexa Fluor and fluorescein, the values correlate with the \n\nformation and stabilisation of the pore\u2019s structure. It appears from our data, using silica \n\n 135\n\n\n\nmonoliths, that the pores retain a liquid phase through aging. However, as the \n\ninterconnections between the pores constrict with time, the effective viscosity increases.  \n\nThis methodology enabled us to understand that although the matrix can template \n\naround an incorporated biomolecule or modifier, there is a size limit to that, and only \n\nsmall molecules display high mobility and are relatively free to circulate within the \n\nhost.  \n\n \n\nThis study concentrated on what could be described as the \u201cactive part\u201d of the \n\nbiosensor \u2013 the interaction of the enzyme and an immobilisation medium. An advance \n\nwould be the fabrication of a flow based system. This could help in the study of the \n\ncatalytic process under well controlled mass flows, to be used in future devices. \n\n Also the use of thin films, rather than the use of monoliths, could be \n\nadvantageous for sensing purposes as it reduces the distance that the reactants have to \n\ndiffuse before encountering the entrapped enzyme. A stack of thin films containing \n\ndifferent sensing moieties would even increase the area of the biosensor and the \n\npossibility of detecting multiple analytes. \n\nThe ability to include sol-gel hybrids at the end of an optical fibre would be the \n\nultimate step towards a functional optical biosensor. In this case, the light from a \n\nconvenient source would travel through the fiber passing through the sol-gel biocatalyst \n\nsensor. The fluorescence response produced after the biochemical reaction would travel \n\nthrough the same fibre to a detector, giving the measure of the concentration of the \n\nanalyte.  \n\nOne very challenging group of enzymes to investigate is the cytochrome P450 \n\nsuperfamily (CYP). CYPs are involved in the synthesis of steroid and bile acids, \n\nhydroxylation of fatty acids, and elimination of xenobiotics and steroids from the body. \n\nThe interest comes from their role in drug interactions, drug toxicity and creation of \n\ncarcinogenic by-products; the isoform aromatase, for example, is a key enzyme of \n\nintratumoral production of estrogen in breast cancer. The immobilisation of this system \n\nis therefore very attractive to analyse drug metabolism. Arrays of multiple CYP \n\nisoforms could be designed to characterise the different metabolic pathways and predict \n\ndrug-drug interactions. \n\nA new generation of biosensors can be expected within the next few decades! \n\n \n\n 136\n\n\n\tAna Isabel Rodrigues Alves Antunes Rei.pdf\n\tP\u00e1gina 1\n\tP\u00e1gina 2\n\tP\u00e1gina 3\n\tP\u00e1gina 4"}]}}}
