Between May and September 2011 we \nsurveyed the community of mid and large bodied mammals using diurnal line transect census (212.4 km), \ncamera-traps (223.2 camera-trap days) and track-stations (478 track-station days). A total of 18 species were \nrecorded from 14 families in eight orders. We recorded the presence of seven species considered threatened in \nthe State of S\u00e3o Paulo, including Primates (Brachyteles arachnoides), Artiodactyla (Mazama cf. americana and \nTayassu pecari), Carnivora (Leopardus pardalis, Leopardus tigrinus and Puma concolor) and Perissodactyla \n(Tapirus terrestris). Based on extrapolated (First order jackknife) species richness estimates we predict that there \nare between 19 and 32 species of mid and large bodied mammals in the N\u00facleo. Our revised Mammal Priority \nIndex ranked N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba as being of medium overall importance for the conservation of mid and large \nbodied mammals in the Atlantic Forest. Combined with the number and diversity of species recorded, our results \ndemonstrate that this N\u00facleo is an important area for mammal conservation.\nKeywords: Atlantic forest, inventory, mammals, protected area.\n\nNORRIS, D., RAM\u00cdREZ, J.M., ZACCHI, C. &amp; GALETTI, M.

As amostragens de \ncampo realizaram-se nos meses de Maio e Setembro de 2011. Utilizou-se, censo ao longo de transectos (212,4 km), \narmadilhas fotogr\u00e1ficas (223,2 armadilhas-dias) e armadilhas de pegadas (478 armadilhas-dias).

However, even the \nmost basic management information (i.e. which mammal species are \npresent) is not available for the majority of the Serra do Mar N\u00facleos, \nwith 6 of the 8 classified as having zero or low levels of knowledge \nregarding the mammalian fauna (Instituto Florestal 2008, p. 180).\n\nRecent diurnal line transect surveys recorded a maximum of \n8 mid to large bodied mammal species within 4 of the Serra do Mar \nN\u00facleos (Picinguaba, Caraguatatuba, Cunha and Santa Virginia \n(Galetti et al. 2009). Although standardized line transect surveys \nprovide a powerful dataset for analysis of species abundances they \nare unlikely to approximate a truly representative sample of the mid \nand large bodied mammal fauna. This group includes rare, cryptic \nand illusive species that to achieve management objectives including \nknowledge of which species are present are best surveyed with a \ncombination of techniques (Michalski &amp; Peres 2007, Espartosa et al. \n2011, Munari et al. 2011). The objective of the present study was to \nuse complementary survey techniques to obtain a baseline species list \nand estimate the species richness of mid and large bodied mammals \nin N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba as the first step to increasing our knowledge \nof the regional mammalian fauna and to support the management \nactivities within this protected area.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\n1. Study area\n\nMammal surveys took place in N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba of the \nSerra do Mar State park (Figure 1). N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba protects  \n49,953 ha (Instituto Florestal 2008) of the pre-Cambrian Serra do \nMar mountain chain (Mantovani 1993). Of the eight administrative \n\u201cN\u00facleos\u201d of the Serra do Mar, 5 including Caraguatatuba are \ncoastal, with N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba being located in the center of \nthe \u201clitoral\u201d tourist region of the state, receiving approximately \n5000 visitors annually. The N\u00facleo is bisected by the Tamoios road, a \nstate highway that leads to the town of Caraguatatuba (45\u00b0 25\u2019 57\u201d W \nand 23\u00b0 35\u2019 52\u201d S). The western portion of the N\u00facleo is also \ntraversed by one of the main pipelines of the Brazilian petroleum \ncompany \u201cPetrobras\u201d. The poorly monitored access provided by the \nTamoios highway and the pipeline are the two principal vectors of \nanthropogenic pressure (i.e. illegal hunting and palm-heart harvesting) \nin the N\u00facleo (Instituto Florestal 2008, p. 119-143).\n\nThe regional climate is subtropical, with a mean annual \ntemperature of 23.2 (daily means ranging from 4.6 to 36.1, data from \n2010 downloaded from the Brazilian weather center http://www.\ncptec.inpe.br/, station ID: 83671, Lat: \u201321.98, Long: \u201347.35 m a.s.l. \n= 598) and annual rainfall from 1400 to 4000 mm (Mantovani 1993). \nSoils are predominantly nutrient-impoverished yellow-red latosol, \npodzols and lithosols (Brasil 1983). Forests range from coastal \n(?20 m) to elevations >900 m, generating stark floristic gradients, \nfrom shrubs to well-developed montane forests (Veloso et al. 1991).\n\n2. Mammal surveys\n\nBetween May and September 2011 we used complementary \ntechniques (line transect census, track surveys and camera-traps) to \nsample the mid and large bodied mammal community across N\u00facleo \nCaraguatatuba (Figure 1). Surveys were conducted by two observers \nwith a minimum of 5 years experience in monitoring neotropical \nmammals. Nomenclature follows that presented in De Vivo et al. \n(2011) except for Alouatta guariba which follows Groves (2005).\n\nDuring 34 days we conducted a total of 212.4 km of diurnal line \ntransect census along 13 (total km = 71.9) preexisting (established \nfor >10 years) trails (trail length: mean, range = 4.9, 0.7-15.7 km). \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Atlantic Forest is the most intensively studied biome for \nBrazilian mammals (Brito et al. 2009). The sampling intensity \nand availability of both published and un-published studies has \nenabled the establishment of priority areas for the conservation \nof mammals across the Atlantic Forest biome (Galetti et al. 2009, \nAlbuquerque et al. 2011). Yet these studies also highlight that there \nremain significant gaps not only in our understanding but also in the \npublished data describing Atlantic Forest mammals (Brito et al. 2009, \nGaletti et al. 2009, Albuquerque et al. 2011). With greater attention \nrequired for the development and dissemination of studies focusing \non obtaining solutions to the management problems facing wild \nmammal species (Brito et al. 2009).\n\nConservation initiatives in Brazil, particularly the Atlantic Forest, \nare cited as examples of the successful integration of legal protection, \nprotected area management, and science-based conservation planning \n(Russo 2009, Brancalion et al. 2010, Tabarelli et al. 2010). However, \ndespite such positive examples, the situation for the fauna and flora \nof the Brazilian Atlantic Forest remains precarious (Marsden et al. \n2005, Tabarelli et al. 2005, Fonseca et al. 2009, Galetti et al. 2009, \nTeixeira et al. 2009, Tabarelli et al. 2010). Protected areas are \nrecognized as a key part of conservation initiatives (Naughton-\nTreves et al. 2005, Rands et al. 2010, Stockstad 2010) with >13% \nof Brazilian terrestrial biomes receiving legal protection at federal \nor state levels (Rylands &amp; Brandon 2005). There are >700 areas \nof Atlantic Forest with at least some level of legal protection \n(Galindo-Leal &amp; C\u00e2mara 2003, Tabarelli et al. 2010). However, \nthe management of protected areas for mid and large bodied \nmammals in the Atlantic Forest is challenging as the majority of \nthese areas (~75%) are small i.e.&lt;100 km2 (Ribeiro et al. 2009) and \nmay not retain suitable environmental conditions for endangered \nspecies (Norris et al. 2011a, Norris et al. 2011b) and threats from \nanthropogenic perturbations such as urbanization, illegal hunting \nand palm heart harvesting are ubiquitous (Galetti &amp; Fernandez \n1998, Tabarelli et al. 2005, Galetti et al. 2009, Teixeira et al. 2009, \nTabarelli et al. 2010).\n\nThe Serra do Mar biogeographical sub-region is the largest area \nof Atlantic Forest in Brazil. More than 50% of forest cover in the \nsub-region is found in forest fragments >50,000 ha and it also includes \nthe largest remnant - a continuous forest area of 1,109,546 ha that is \nlocated along the coast of S\u00e3o Paulo State (Ribeiro et al. 2009). The \nSerra do Mar State Park is embedded within this continuous area, \nprotecting 315,390 ha of Atlantic Forest that includes a variety of \nhabitat types from lowland (sea-level) coastal restinga to highland \n(>200 masl) dense mountainous ombrofilous forest (Instituto Florestal \n2008, p. 11-15). The size of the protected area generates unique \nmanagement challenges and to meet these challenges it was necessary \nto divide the area into eight administrative units or \u201cN\u00facleos\u201d \n(Instituto Florestal 2008, p. 13-15). Although this area is continuous, \nthe Serra do Mar continues to suffer from intensive hunting and palm \nheart harvesting. The numerous highways that cross the park, and the \npresence of major gas and oil pipelines facilitates entry of hunters \nto \u201cremote\u201d park areas (Aguiar et al. 2003, Instituto Florestal 2008, \np. 129). Additionally, park borders are densely populated and illegal \nhunting, palm heart and bromeliad harvesting is common place \n(Instituto Florestal 2008, p. 119-143).\n\nAlthough challenging from a management perspective, the \nsize and diversity of protected habitats means that we expect to \nfind high levels of biodiversity within the Serra do Mar State park \n(Aguiar et al. 2003). Indeed, within such a well connected and \nbiodiverse expanse of forest (Aguiar et al. 2003) it is not unreasonable \nto predict the occurrence of a significant proportion of the 45 species \n\nhttp://www.biotaneotropica.org.br\nhttp://www.cptec.inpe.br\nhttp://www.cptec.inpe.br\n\n\n129\n\nMid and large bodied mammals of N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba\n\nhttp://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v12n2/en/abstract?inventory+bn00312022012 http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br\n\nBiota Neotrop., vol. 12, no. 2\n\nTo provide a representative sample, trails were distributed throughout \nthe N\u00facleo (Figure 1) and encompassed a variety of secondary and \nprimary forest habitats. From the total of 71.9 trail km, the majority \n(51.9 km) were in forest dominated by early or advanced secondary \nsuccessional stages, followed by primary (7.9 km) and eucalyptus \nand pine plantations (6.8 km).\n\nStandard line transect protocols (Peres 1999, Buckland et al. \n2010) were adapted to fit our main objective of sampling mid \nand large bodied mammals across the widest possible variety of \nhabitats within the park. Census was not conducted during heavy \nrainfall but did occur during light showers i.e. when observers \ncould walk comfortably without wearing protective clothing. \nCensus was carried out during the morning (5:40 AM - 1:13 PM) \n\nand or afternoon (12:47 PM - 5:35 PM), with times varying due to \nlogistical constraints and weather conditions. Although there was a \nslight overlap between the timing of morning and afternoon census, \non any one day there was a minimum of 2 hours between the end of \nmorning and start of afternoon census when we used the same trail \nand a minimum of 1 hour between morning and afternoon census \nwhen different trails were used. We do not consider this extension \nof the timing of our morning census to have biased our surveys. The \nstandardization of census times has been determined from studies \nin tropical conditions where the heat during midday hours (between \n12:00 AM and 2:00 PM) limits mammal activity (Peres 1999). Diurnal \ntemperatures within our sub-tropical study area are not comparable to \nthose in these tropical areas. At the latitude of N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba \n\nFigure 1. Study area showing locations of survey trails and camera-traps used to survey mid and large bodied mammals in N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba, Serra do \nMar State Park, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nhttp://www.biotaneotropica.org.br\n\n\n130\n\nNorris, D. et al.\n\nhttp://www.biotaneotropica.org.br http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v12n2/en/abstract?inventory+bn00312022012\n\nBiota Neotrop., vol. 12, no. 2\n\nmammals are often seen during these \u201cmidday\u201d hours, appearing to \navoid activity during the often cold (<14 \u00b0C) early mornings. For \nexample we did not detect any mammals before 9 AM. To enable us \nto survey the maximum range of habitats possible we did not follow \nthe recommended line transect survey speed of ?1.25 km per hour \n(Peres 1999, Buckland et al. 2010). Although we did pause regularly \nat 100 to 300 m intervals to listen for detection cues, our mean per \ntrail census speed was above the recommended value (survey speed: \nmean, range = 2.4, 1.1-3.4 km per hour). Although it is possible \nthat this increased census speed resulted in missed detections, we \nfound no significant relationship between the number of detections \nrecorded per km and the survey speed (Spearmans correlation, \nrho = \u20130.223, p = 0.221). We are therefore confident that our \nmodifications of the standard census protocols did not introduce any \nsystematic bias and that our line transect survey results are directly \ncomparable with previous studies.\n\nDuring our line transect surveys we also recorded tracks that \nwere visible along the trails. These \u201cad hoc\u201d detection events were \nsupplemented by a total of 25 un-baited track-stations placed along \ntwo of our census trails (Figure 1). Track-stations were prepared \nby removing leaf litter, rocks and surface roots from a 75 \u00d7 75 cm \nquadrant followed by loosening, separating and smoothing the soil \nsurface with a machete so that it would be possible to discern track \nimpressions of mid to large bodied mammals >2 kg (tested by the \ngentle application of finger tips to the prepared surface). Track-\nstations were checked at 3-6 day intervals. Days with heavy rain were \nexcluded from our effort, resulting in an overall effort of 478 track-\nstation days. Observers (each with >5 years experience of surveying \nmid and large bodied mammals in Neotropical forests) recorded \nthe species identity of tracks with reference to field guides (Becker \n&amp; Dalponte 1991, Emmons &amp; Feer 1997). In cases where species \nidentity was uncertain we took photos that were sent to specialists \nfor confirmation. Any tracks that could not be reliably identified were \nnot included in our analysis.\n\nFrom June to July 2011 we installed 12 digital camera-traps \n(6 Reconyx, RECONYX, Inc. Wisconsin, USA - http://www.\nreconyx.com/ and 6 Ecotone, ECOTONE, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil http://\nwww.ecotonebrasil.com). Cameras were installed in two areas \n(Figure 1) separated by a 12.9 km straight line distance \u2013 one close \nto the park base (5 cameras \u2013 103.7 camera-trap days) and one in an \narea that receives no visitors and has been relatively undisturbed for \nat least 30 years (7 cameras \u2013 119.5 camera-trap days), providing \na total effort of 223.2 camera-trap days. Cameras were operational \ncontinuously over the 24 hours diel cycle and placed at random \nlocations between 5 and 15 m to the side of existing trails within \neach area, with a minimum straight line nearest neighbor distance \nof 530 m. However, due to the steep topography including near \nvertical ravines, the minimum distance between cameras for any \nterrestrial mammal is effectively >1400 m. We attached cameras to \ntrees at a height of ? 40 cm above the ground. The area in front of \ncameras was cleared of green foliage and herbs to prevent sunlight \nreflections damaging image quality. Due to licensing restrictions \ncameras remained un-baited, but were checked at 2 \u2013 9 day intervals \nto ensure continuous operation and for routine maintenance e.g. to \nchange batteries.\n\n3. Data analysis\n\nTo understand the relationship between species richness and \nour survey effort we used the \u201cspecaccum\u201d function of the \u201cvegan\u201d \npackage (Oksanen et al. 2011) in the R software (R Development \nCore Team 2011) to estimate the individual based rarefaction curve of \nmean species richness per sample day. For this analysis we summed \nall individuals recorded for each species using any technique by the \n\nsurvey date, generating a matrix of 18 species by 22 survey days (we \nexcluded days with no mammal species records). To predict the total \nnumber of species present in the N\u00facleo that it would be possible to \ndetect using the combination of survey techniques we used the \u201cFirst \norder jackknife\u201d estimator to extrapolate the species richness from \nthe frequencies of species encountered per day (function \u201cspecpool\u201d, \npackage \u201cvegan\u201d). Although a number of extrapolation estimators \nare available we chose this one to enable comparison with previous \nstudies (Espartosa et al. 2011).\n\nTo provide a measure of the conservation importance of N\u00facleo \nCaraguatatuba we calculated the Mammalian Priority Conservation \nIndex (Galetti et al. 2009). This index provides a comparitive measure \nof the importance of the site by incorporating native species richness, \nspecies threat status (based on the threat status in the State of S\u00e3o \nPaulo (Magalh\u00e3es-Bressan et al. 2009), species uniqueness and body \nsize as well as the site forest area (see Galetti et al. 2009 for full details \nof index calculation and interpretation). To enable comparison with \nprevious studies (Galetti et al. 2009) we only used data from the line \ntransect censuses to derive the index.\n\nResults\n\nWe obtained records of 18 mid to large bodied mammal species \nfrom 14 families in 8 orders, of which seven species are considered \nthreatened (\u201cVulnerable\u201d or \u201cEndangered\u201d) in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo \nand five (27.8%) are considered threatened internationally (Table 1). \nCamera-traps recorded the most species (12), followed by tracks \n(10), other indirect detections (7) and finally direct visual detections \nfrom diurnal line transect census (6). Tapirus terrestris was the only \nspecies recorded with all four classes of detection technique, whereas \nsix species (Didelphis aurita - photos, Tayassu pecari - tracks, \nLeopardus tigrinus - photos, Lontra longicaudis - tracks, \nBradypus variegatus - carcass and Brachyteles arachnoides- visual) \nwere only recorded by a single class (Table 1).\n\nThe estimated curve of species richness per survey day did not \nreach an asymptote, with species continuing to accumulate at a rate \nof 0.4 species per day after 22 survey days (Figure 2). Based on the \nFirst order jackknife our extrapolated species richness was 26 species \n(estimate \u00b1 95% CI = 25.63 \u00b1 6.07).\n\nFigure 2.

The relative abundances obtained from diurnal census enabled \nus to calculate a revised Mammalian Priority Index of 15.29, which \nfollowing the thresholds established by Galetti et al. ( 2009) classifies \nthe N\u00facleo as an area of medium overall importance for large-bodied \nmammals in the Atlantic Forest.\n\nAlthough rarely detected during diurnal censuses Tapirus terrestris \nwas the most commonly recorded species with camera-traps \n(0.524 independent photos per 10 camera-trap nights), followed by \nDasypus novemcinctus and Didelphis aurita (0.242 independent \nphotos per 10 camera-trap nights). The most infrequently \nphotographed species were Cebus nigritus, Cuniculus paca, \nDasyprocta cf. azarae, and Guerlinguetus ingrami (0.040 independent \nphotos per 10 camera-trap nights).\n\nDiscussion\n\nAlthough Atlantic Forest mammals are relatively well studied \nthere is little comparative data available from studies of mid and large \nbodied mammals in continuous forest areas. In a recent compilation \n\n(Galetti et al. 2009) found that from a total of 31 mid and large \nbodied mammal species a maximum of only 13 (41.9%) species were \nrecorded using diurnal line transect census in 34 mainland Atlantic \nForest sites. Other studies that employ a range of techniques generally \nrecord a greater number of species on a per site basis. For example, \nusing line transect census (241 km) in secondary forest areas of the \nMorro Grande Forest Reserve - a 10,870 ha protected area close to \nthe city of S\u00e3o Paulo Negr\u00e3o &amp; Valladares-P\u00e1dua (2006) recorded five \nspecies of mid to large bodied mammals but when these results were \ncombined with sand track-stations (600 track-station days) a total of \n18 species were recorded in the same area (Negr\u00e3o &amp; Valladares-\nP\u00e1dua 2006). Other studies from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest report \nsimilar patterns with more species recorded when different techniques \nwere applied simultaneously: a total of 16 species were recorded in a \n221 ha area of semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest using visual searches \nand camera-traps (Abreu Junior &amp; K\u00f6hler 2009), 23 species in a \n230 ha semi-deciduous forest area using line transect census (271 km), \ncamera-traps (336.5 camera-trap days) and track-stations (1258 track-\nstation nights) (Gaspar 2005), 29 species in a 17 491 ha protected \narea using visual searches (128 km), camera-traps (1842 camera-trap \nnights) and nocturnal surveys along park roads (Kasper et al. 2007). \nHowever none of these studies present species richness curves/\n\nTable 1.

Although it is not possible \nto make direct comparisons with other Atlantic Forest studies \nour predicted species richness shows the importance of N\u00facleo \nCaraguatatuba for the conservation of regional masto-fauna. Of \nthe 18 species recorded seven (39%) are threatened in the State of \nS\u00e3o Paulo and five (27.8%) are threatened internationally (Table 1, \nMagalh\u00e3es-Bressan et al. 2009, International\u2026 2011). It is worth \nnoting that of the 18 species recorded, populations of only one \n(D. novemcinctus) are increasing (Abba &amp; Superina 2009). From a \nsurvey of 24 secondary forest sites (some connected to the western \npart of the Serra do Mar forest massive) using baited camera-traps \n(minimum effort of 2160 camera-trap days) and baited sand track-\nstations (minimum effort of 1224 track-station days) Espartosa et al. \n(2011) recorded a total of 14 native species of mid to large bodied \nmammals, with species richness estimates predicting a maximum of \n15 native species present in the 10 000 ha study region. We managed \nto record a similar number of species to Espartosa et al. (2011) using a \nfraction of their survey effort and time, which emphasizes the richness \nand diversity of the mid and large bodied mammal community in \nN\u00facleo Caraguatatuba compared with unprotected and fragmented \nAtlantic Forest remnants. Another important difference is that the \nmammal community within the N\u00facleo appears to be relatively intact \nincluding large bodied species such as T. terrestris and T. pecari, \nwhereas the species recorded by Espartosa et al. (2011) represented \na relatively simplified assemblage of smaller bodied generalists.\n\nAs our species richness estimate showed that we missed between \n2 and 14 species we also expect further studies to add to the list of \nthreatened species within the N\u00facleo. For example populations of \nthe threatened buffy-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix aurita) have \nbeen recorded in the neighboring N\u00facleo Santa Virginia (Norris et al. \n2011b) and it seems likely that there may be as yet undetected \npopulations within N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba. We would also expect to \nfind carnivores such as jaguar (Panthera onca) and the crab-eating \nfox (Cerdocyon thous) plus at least one additional cervid species - the \nsmall brocket deer (Mazama bororo). Indeed, cervids highlight a \nremaining problem in neotropical mammalogy - uncertainty in species \nidentification and classification (Brito et al. 2009). We identified the \ncervid species (M. cf. americana) based on characteristic size and \ncoloration, however similarities with M. bororo mean that genetic \nstudies are necessary to confirm the species presence. The same is true \nfor the rodent D. azarae, which may be confused with D. leporina. \nAlthough the characteristic \u201cred-rump\u201d of D. leporina was not \napparent in the photo taken, further genetic studies are required to \nconfirm the species identity within the N\u00facleo. Although predicting \nwhich species are likely to be detected is inherently speculative, \nthese issues highlight that even though the Atlantic Forest is the most \nintensively studied biome for mammals in Brazil (Brito et al. 2009), \nthe knowledge necessary for effective conservation and management \nof Atlantic Forest mammals is far from complete.\n\nOur revised Mammal Priority Index ranked N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba \nas being of medium overall importance for the conservation of mid \nand large bodied mammals in the Atlantic Forest. Combined with \nthe number and diversity of species recorded we believe this group \nof mammals must be considered a management priority within this \nprotected area. Our species list provides a baseline upon which \nmanagement activities can be measured and evaluated. However, \nfuture studies focusing on species ecology, habitat preferences and \npopulation densities are required to inform management activities. \n\nFor example further studies are required to enable the definition of \nzones within the protected area as defined by Brazilian Law (Law: \n9.985/2000 (SNUC)). Zonation will enable the myriad objectives \nof a protected area to be met efficiently and in harmony with the \nregional and national socio-economic context (Wells &amp; Brandon 1993, \nHalpin 1997). Although species richness and diversity is a criteria for \nestablishing the conservation value of zones within the park (Instituto \nFlorestal 2008, p. 257), there is as yet no data to define a spatially \nexplicit map of species distributions for any floral or faunal group \nwithin N\u00facleo Caraguatatuba. We hope the list of mammals presented \nhere encourages future studies to fill such gaps.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis project was supported by a Rufford Small Grant for Nature \nConservation, the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o \nPaulo \u2013 FAPESP (Biota Program, FAPESP 2007/03392-6).
