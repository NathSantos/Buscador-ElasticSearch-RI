Introduction\n\nOne of the main causes of water quality deterioration \nis fish pond management. The daily addition of food and \nfertilization for plankton growth, with a subsequent increase \nin nutrient rates in the water column, are always required \nfor fish development.\n\nTo fill a fish pond, water may come from several \nsources such as wells, creaks, rivers, reservoirs or other \nnatural sources. Water may either pass through the pond \nand be discharged or it may be partially retained. Water \nalso contains nutrients, which can stimulate the growth \nof plankton population, aquatic plants and may also \ncontain great amounts of organic and inorganic matter, \nwhich influence water quality of the pond (Adeoye et al., \n2009). Furthermore, the feed given daily to fish may not be \ndirectly consumed by fish species but may be leached into \nthe pond, affecting all levels of nutrient availability and \nplankton growth in such systems (Ferdoushi et al., 2008).\n\nRegular fertilization in fish ponds accumulates nutrients \nat the bottom of the water body. The most limiting nutrients \nfor the plankton population are nitrogen and phosphorus, \nand the main source of such substances in fish ponds are \nfish excretion, the protein level in food and release from \nthe sediment. In fact, decomposition of organic matter \nproduces ammonia, which diffuses from sediment to \nthe water column (Hargreaves and Tucker, 2004). High \nnutrient load and production accumulate organic matter \nat the bottom sediment which maintains high internal \nloading (Pokorn\u00fd and Hauser, 2002).\n\nThere is a direct relationship between nutrients and \nphytoplankton density and species diversity. Chowdhury et al. \n(2007) observed low abundance of phytoplankton in \nlow temperature and nitrate concentration, although \nphosphate exhibited an inverse relationship with the \ngrowth rate of planktonic organisms. Recent studies have \nsuggested phosphorus as the most limiting nutrient with \nregard to phytoplankton. As a rule, affinity constants for \northophosphate by Cyanobacteria occurred (Moutin et al., \n2002; Tanaka et al., 2004).\n\nNutrients increase is readily incorporated into the \nplankton community and ultimately into the fish biomass. \nSeveral studies (Naz and Turkemen, 2005; Arimoro et al., \n2008; Shan et al., 2008) have reported higher densities \nof plankton (mainly phytoplankton) during the rainy \nseason owing to the fact that rains carry allochthonous \nnutrients from the drainage basin as well as mixing of \nthe autochthonous material. Primary production and \nconsequently phytoplankton production and abundance are \naccelerated (Basualto et al., 2006; Arimoro et al., 2008).\n\nPlankton biomass and composition in shallow water \nbodies fluctuate as a reaction to several interacting driving \nforces which may include polymixis, water-level changes, \nweather conditions, nutrients loading and feeding management \n(Borics et al., 2000).\n\nIn the case of aquaculture, the maintenance of good \nwater quality is of primary importance so that excellent \nculture environment, adequate feed for optimal fish yield \n\npotential, appraisal of the eutrophic situation and increase in \nplankton population may be achieved. This is because fish \npond systems are affected by temporal changes which may \ncause fluctuations in planktonic population composition and \nassemblage. Therefore, the present investigation aims at \nanalysing the occurrence and abundance of phytoplankton \nand zooplankton in a fish pond and their relationship with \nlimnological variables.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\n2.1. Study area and sampling sites\n\nCurrent research was carried out at the Aquaculture \nCenter (21\u00b0 14\u2019 05\u201d S and 48\u00b0 17\u2019 09\u201d W), at the Universidade \nEstadual Paulista (UNESP), Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, in a \nfish pond with continuous water flow which provides a \ndaily exchange of 5% of volume. According to the K\u00f6pen \nclassification, the region\u2019s climate is Cwa, subtropical, \nrelatively dry in the winter (June to September) and rainy \nin the summer (October to March), with mean yearly \ntemperature of 22 \u00b0C and at mean of altitude 605 m. The \nfish pond surface area is 2,036 m2 and the mean depth is \n1.30 m. The fish pond was populated with the fish species \nPiaractus mesopotamicus (\u201cpacu\u201d), Colossoma macropomum \n(\u201ctambaqui\u201d), Pseudoplatystoma corruscan (\u201cpintado\u201d) and \nBrycon cephalus (\u201cmatrinx\u00e3\u201d) breeders. The total number of \nfishes was three hundred. Fish were fed with a supplementary \ndiet containing 28% crude protein. Samples for abiotic and \nbiotic variables determination were undertaken monthly, \nfrom December 2007 to November 2008. Water samples \nwere collected at six sampling sites: P\n\n1\n = back water area; \n\nP\n2\n = outlet water; P\n\n3\n = deep water site; P\n\n4\n = inlet water from \n\n6 fish ponds of 80 m2; P\n5\n = inlet water from 11 fish ponds \n\nof 50 m2, and P\n6\n = inlet water from of water supply fish \n\npond, ornamental fish lab and four fish ponds of 200 m2, \nwhere the macrophyte stand lies (Figure 1).\n\n2.2. Plankton\n\nSampling for plankton was done using a Van Dorn \nbottle filtering a volume of 5 L for phytoplankton and 10 L \nto zooplankton. The plankton samples were filtered with \n25 and 58 mm mesh nets, and preserved in Lugol iodine \nsolution and formalin (4%), respectively, for phytoplankton \nand zooplankton. Numerical densities data were expressed \nas ind.m3 \u00d7 103, ind.L\u20131, and percentage abundance (%). The \nconcentrated preserved plankton samples were analysed \nusing a Sedgewick-Rafter counting cell and examined \nunder 100 \u00d7 magnification. Cladocera and Copepoda, \nwere counted in a reticulated chamber. Approximately \nfour hundred individuals of the most abundant species \nwere registered, with an approximate 10% precision, \nand a 95% confidence interval (Bicudo and Bicudo, \n2004). Frequency of occurrence was estimated for total \nphytoplankton and zooplankton organisms were divided \ninto three categories: constant (50% or above); common \n(between 10% and 50%) and rare (between 1 and 10%) \n(Sampaio et al., 2002).\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 2011, vol. 71, no. 4, p. 845-855\n\nWater quality in earthen polyculture pond\n\n847\n\n2.3. Limnological variables\n\nWater samples were collected at 0.10 m depth. \nTransparency was measured using a Secchi disk, temperature \ndissolved oxygen and pH were taken with a multiparametric \nprobe (Horiba U-10), chlorophyll-a was evaluated according \nto Nusch (1980), nutrients according to Koroleff (1976) \nand Golterman et al. (1978). All samples were transported \nto the laboratory in cold boxes.\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\n\nTwo-way ANOVA was used for physical and chemical \nparameters in order to compare sites and months, and \ntheir interactions, with significance level of p &lt;0.05 \n(Fowler et al., 1998). Pearson\u2019s correlation (p &lt;0.05) was \nused to find out the levels of significance of relationship \nbetween groups of phytoplankton and zooplankton and \nenvironmental variables, by using the Statistic 6.0 program. \n\nSites were grouped by cluster analysis (unweighted pair \ngroup average linkage, UPGMA) based on the Bray Curtis \nindex, using abundance log\n\n10\n (x + 1) transformed data of \n\nall plankton (Magurran, 1989).\n\n3. Results\n\nAlthough a significant difference (p &lt;0.05) was \nobserved between months, no significant difference \n(p > 0.05) was reported between sites when comparing \northophosphate, nitrate and total phosphorus (TP). By \ncontrast, ammonia levels showed significant difference \n(p &lt;0.05) between sites, but no difference (p > 0.05) \nbetween months. Dissolved oxygen values varied from \n3.0 to 7.3 mg.L\u20131 with differences (p &lt;0.05) between \nsites and months. Although TP in the water column was \nnot high; the highest values were reported in October \nat P\n\n2\n (159 mg.L\u20131). TP and orthophosphate fluctuation \n\nrates were similar to those of the highest concentrations \nreported between June through October. Since during the \nsame period the lowest values were registered with the \nhighest phytoplankton cell densities in the water, there \nwas an inverse relationship between orthophosphate and \nthe different phytoplanktonic groups (Figures 2 and 3).\n\nThe Bacillariophyceae group, abundant throughout \nthe study period, was the only exception (Figures 3). High \nnitrate rates, ranging between 1 and 210 mg.L\u20131, were \nreported between December and March when the highest \ncell densities for Euglenophyceae, Chlorophyceae and \nCyanobacteria occurred. The Zygnematophyceae group \nhad the highest cell densities in June with 288 ind.m3 \u00d7 103 \n(76%) when TP and orthophosphate concentrations in the \nwater column were high. Nitrate concentration was highest \nat P\n\n1\n (210 mg.L\u20131) and TP was lower than 106 mg.L\u20131, with \n\nCyanobacteria cell densities above 90 ind.m3 \u00d7 103, associated \nwith high temperatures (>25 \u00b0C) (Figures 2 and 3; Table 1).\n\nFurthermore, pH was alkaline throughout the research \nvarying between 7.2 and 8.7, except in October at P\n\n3\n, when \n\nthose values reached 9.9. This fact coincided with high \nammonia concentration (175 mg.L\u20131) during the whole \nstudy period, which were more associated with fish feeding \nmanagement (diet addition). There were no significant \ndifferences in pH values (p > 0.05) between sites and \nmonths. Chlorophyll-a values varied from 3 to 56 mg.L\u20131 \nand were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between \nsites and months (Figures 2 and 4). A sudden fall in \ntemperature in July directly affected some phytoplanktonic \npopulations with Chlorophyceae, Zygnematophyceae, and \nEuglenophyceae. Copepoda and Bacillariophyceae were \nalso affected (Figures 3 and 5; Table 1). Transparency \nwas directly related to the fall in temperature values and \nto the phytoplankton community higher density in July, \nranging between 0.7 and 0.9 m among the sampled sites. \nTransparency and temperature values were significantly \ndifferent (p &lt;0.05) between sites during the year. As a \nrule dissolved oxygen was above 4 mg.L\u20131, with significant \ndifferences between sites and months (p &lt;0.01), and \ninverse relation with temperature (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 1.

The Bacillariophyceae group \nwas the most representative, followed by Chlorophyceae, \nZygnematophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Cyanobacteria and \nOedogonophyceae. The species Oedogonium sp., reported \nat P\n\n5\n with a density of 20 ind.m3 \u00d7 103 during December \n\n2007, represented the latter (Table 2). Few phytoplanktonics \nspecies were constant (13 species), with occurrence reported \nat P\n\n1\n, P\n\n2\n and P\n\n4\n. The first site had the largest number of \n\nconstant species (Table 2).\nThe zooplankton community consisted of 24 taxa, or \n\nrather, 4 Cladocera, 2 Copepoda and 18 Rotifera. Copepoda \nspecies were constant or common at the sampled sites \nthroughout the period, excepting P\n\n3\n. Only Trichocerca sp. \n\namong Rotifera species were constant in all sampled \nsites, whereas Diaphanosoma birgei, ranging between \n4 and 342 ind.L\u20131 (0.7 and 2.4%) during the study period, \nwas the most representative among the Cladocera species \n\n(Table 3). Zooplankton species were more abundant during \nthe rainy period (December through March) when the high \nfish diet increase rate and nutrient availability (mainly nitrates) \noccurred. In fact, high phytoplankton density as food for \nzooplankton was available. High rates of Cyanobacteria in \nDecember at P\n\n1\n did not influence Rotifera and Copepoda \n\ndensity at this site (Figures 3 and 5; Table 1).\nSimilarity analyses for plankton densities showed the \n\nformation of three groups, P\n3\n and P\n\n2\n sites were markedly \n\ndifferent from the rest with regard to phytoplankton and \nzooplankton, respectively (Figure 6).\n\n4.

This \nmight be due to the fact that increase in nitrogen inflow \nstimulates the zooplankton community (Mischke and \nZimba, 2009). Nitrate is found in well-oxygenated waters \nand its variability is due to biological activity (Neofitou and \n\nFigure 4.

Relative abundance (%) of zooplankton groups \nin the fish pond at the different samples sites (P\n\n1\n-P\n\n6\n) during \n\nthe studied period.\n\nKlaoudatos, 2008). The above was confirmed in current \nresearch since high nitrate concentrations, when compared \nwith other nutrients (TP, orthophosphate and ammonia), \nmay be associated with dissolved oxygen above 4 mg.L\u20131 \nand the continuous water flow which is heightened during \nthe summer when heavy rains occur.\n\nAmmonia nitrogen is the most important and readily \navailable nitrogen source for phytoplankton. In the current \nstudy, ammonia concentrations were lower than 135 mg.L\u20131 \n(except in P\n\n3\n in October), probably due to the fast ammonia \n\nuptake by phytoplankton, mainly by Bacillariophyceae \nspecies, with high cell densities at most sampled sites \nthroughout the whole studied period. The relatively low \nammonia concentrations between November and December \n(summer) may be attributed the competitive advantage for \nCyanobacteria due to high affinity ammonium uptake. Low \nammonia concentration between May and July (winter) \nis associated with the cyclic feeding regimes (periods of \nfeed deprivation followed by re-feeding) in fish production \n\n\n\nBraz. J.

The cyanobacteria \ngroup has a better development in warm temperatures, \nhigh light intensity and high levels of phosphorus and \nnitrogen. Since phosphorus and nitrogen are commonly \nfound in fertilizers used in fish ponds and relatively high \ntemperatures are favourable conditions for the growth of \nCyanobacteria (Rahman and Jewel, 2008), the taxon was \ndominant at temperatures above 20 \u00b0C, alkaline pH and \nhigh nutrient concentration (Wilson et al., 2006). These \ndata confirm findings in the present study. Alkaline natural \nwater with hypolimnion oxygen deficit and an occurrence \nof Cyanobacteria phytoplankton, especially Microcystis sp. \nare indicative of the eutrophic nature of the water body \n(Rahman and Jewel, 2008). Results showed that when \n\nthe density of Cyanobacteria was higher, 90 ind.m3 \u00d7 103 \n(85.5%), the most representative group was Microcystis sp., \nwith 65% of total cells in P\n\n1\n during December. Jewel et al. \n\n(2006) reported that Cyanobacteria cell density increased \nas a function of mean nitrogen. Management practices of \nfish ponds, such as high allochthonous nutrients loading, \nresults in massive development of phytoplankton and \nCyanobacteria water blooms and high fluctuations of \nphysical-chemical parameters (Pokorn\u00fd and Hauser, 2002).\n\nCyanobacteria are also known to deeply affect \nzooplankton community structure and secondary production \n(Tillmans et al., 2008). Generally, Cyanobacteria are a poor \nfood source for freshwater grazers, when compared to small \nChlorophyceae and/or flagellates. Besides, Cladocera and \nRotifera populations are affected differently by distinct \nCyanobacteria morphologies (Wilson et al., 2006). In this \nstudy, Cladocera density was affected by high densities \nof Cyanobacteria (P\n\n1\n in December), which has not been \n\nTable 3.

This may be due to the fact \nthat density of Rotifera at P\n\n1\n, was mainly represented by \n\ncarnivorous species, such as Polyarthra dolichoptera, \nAsplanchna sp. and Thrichocerca sp., during the period.\n\nThe high density of Rotifera in the fish pond studied \nhas been associated with high density of Cyanobacteria \n(December). According to Gilbert (1990), Cyanobacteria \nprevent the suppression of Rotifera by large Cladocera \nand lead towards the dominance of Rotifera. Several \nstudies have demonstrated the effects of Cyanobacteria \non Copepoda filtration rate, egg, production and survival \n(Ruokolainen et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2006; Rahman \nand Jewel, 2008). Copepoda density decreased when high \ncell density of Cyanobacteria in P\n\n1\n occurred in December \n\nand less representative in P\n3\n in February and September; \n\nand in P\n1\n and P\n\n2\n in November. An increasing trend in \n\nCopepoda species occurred between May to July when \nCyanobacteria density decreases. Evidence suggests that \nCyanobacteria are low quality food for Copepoda owing \nto their protease inhibitors (Ruokolainen et al., 2006). The \ngreatest abundances of Cyanobacteria were observed in \nthe site P\n\n1\n where orthophosphate concentration was at its \n\nlowest Cyanobacteria abundance might have been influenced \nby a favourable N:P ratio. Further shallow systems are \ncharacterised by phosphate limitation because the biologically \navailable phosphorus amount is small when the quantity \nrequired for algal growth is take into consideration (Neofitou \nand Klaoudatos, 2008). Orthophosphate concentrations \nin the current study were lower than 50 mg.L\u20131, except \n\nat the P\n6\n (September) site. This is probably due to high \n\nmacrophytes density at the site (P\n6\n) which leads to high \n\norganic content. The P\n6\n site exhibited great amounts of \n\nallochthonous materials coming from other fish ponds that \ndirectly discharge their load into the water body under \nanalysis. This fact is supported by low orthophosphate \nconcentrations corresponding to high plankton abundance \nfrom December to March.\n\nIn this study, phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations \nwere below characteristic eutrophication conditions, \nwhich are 0.3 mg.L\u20131 for nitrogen and 0.001 mg.L\u20131 for \nphosphorus in fish ponds, considering the maximum value \nrecommended as an environmental quality standard to \navoid eutrophication (Neofitou and Klaoudatos, 2008). \nThe opposite behaviour was observed with chlorophyll-a, \nwhich has shown concentrations of over 10 mg.L\u20131.\n\nHigh rates of nutrients supply often constitute a large \nfraction of the photosynthetic biomass. Predominance of \nBacillariophyceae species throughout the period under \nanalysis has been associated with alkaline water, because \nacidic waters do not support an abundance of species and \nshow high activity at relatively low temperature (Allen et al., \n2005). Kumar and Oommen (2009) reported that acidic \nwaters do not support an abundance of Bacillariophyceae, \nwhereas their density is higher in alkaline waters, with pH \nabove 8.0, and diatom growth is stimulated by nitrate. In \nthis investigation alkaline pH (between 7.2 and 8.8) except \nat P\n\n3\n in October, and high nitrate concentrations, supported \n\na high population of diatoms.\nA high load of organic matter (dead algal cell, fish feed \n\nsolids, uneaten feed) in bottom sediments is related to the \nfish pond\u2019s fertilization management featuring plankton \ndensities, high quantities of non-consumed remains and \nconsequently large metabolites produced by fish, mainly \nin the growing fish period during the rainy and hot season. \nIn fact, the fish pond under analysis, receives effluents \nfrom other ponds which contribute with large organic and \ninorganic loads into the system. The above mentioned are \nalso responsible for high nitrate concentrations and organic \nmatter associated with the large amounts of organic input \noriginating from effluent discharge.\n\n Transparency indicates the presence and absence of \nfood particles and productivity of a water body, which is \ninfluenced by suspended materials, silt and microorganisms \n(Ferdoushi et al., 2008). The above pattern was highly \nevident in the current analysis. When high transparency \noccurred in July, the Chlorophyceae, Zygnematophyceae \nand Euglenophyceae cell densities were below 17 ind.\nm3 \u00d7 103 (6.7%) and Cyanobacteria were practically \nabsent. The quantitative and qualitative abundance of \nplankton and its relationship to environmental conditions \nare a prerequisite for fish production. In fact, plankton \nproductivity depends on the ecological balance between \nthe various physical-chemical factors (Chowdhury et al., \n2007). In general, the highest transparency values were \nobserved at P\n\n6\n close to the macrophyte stand. Water bodies \n\nwith medium and dense macrophytes cover are characterised \nby low concentration of suspended sediments; hence, their \n\nFigure 6.

Water transparency is reduced \nwhen opposite occurred (Ferdoushi et al., 2008).\n\nMoreover, dissolved oxygen has been found to be \nconsiderably high in colder months (June to August). \nThe plankton community, on which the whole aquatic \npopulation depends, is largely affected by an interaction \nof a number of limiting factors such as low dissolved \noxygen, moderate sulphate, nitrate, phosphate and other \nfactors (Kumar and Oommen, 2009).\n\nAccording to cluster analysis for plankton, the sites \ninfluenced by allochthonous materials (organic and \ninorganic) of other fish ponds were very similar. P\n\n3\n and \n\nP\n2\n sites exhibited the highest differences when compared \n\nto other sites. Such differences may be associated with \ndepth (P\n\n3\n) and strong water flow (P\n\n2\n), especially at this \n\nparticular water outlet which directly discharges into the \nsubsequent pond.\n\nManagement procedures (stocking densities, feeding, \nsediment removal, fertilizing) of fish ponds are the key to \nsustainable fish production and directly affect the ecological \nprocesses developing in the water column. Variations \nof the physical and chemical parameters in a fish pond \nreveal that the limnological conditions in the fish pond \nare not spatially homogenous, since differences have been \nobserved not only between the different sampling months, \nbut also between the different sites analysed. Based on the \nresults of the current analysis, water quality management \nin the fish pond shows a direct influence on planktonic \npopulation, since fish ponds are shallow and constantly \nreceive large nutrient loads (feed, fertilizing, fish waste) \nwhich contribute towards algal growth, Cyanobacteria and \nundesired zooplanktonic organisms. Excessive phytoplankton \ngrowth could be avoided by limiting nutrients to plankton \ngrowth through fish feed deprivation periods. The length \nof the latter may be sufficient so that phosphorus and \nnitrogen may be depleted and phytoplankton abundance \ndecreased (Turano et al., 2008).\n\nIn summary, the fish pond studied was dominated \nby diatoms and green algae, while Cyanobacteria were \nmore frequent during the summer. In general, whereas \nreported high phytoplankton density was registered in \nFebruary and March (summer), zooplankton density \noccurred between December and March (summer). The \nmaintenance of macrophytes at one of the fish pond\u2019s \nwater inlet sites (P\n\n6\n) was an asset for the retention of great \n\norganic and inorganic load from other ponds beyond that \nstudied. Limnological conditions in the fish pond in fact \naffected the development of the different components \nof the plankton population during the period analysed. \nFuture studies aiming at evaluating the effect of adequate \nmanagement of water quality on planktonic population \nare thus encouraged.\n\nAcknowledgements \u2013 The authors would like to thank the \n\u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\u201d \n(FAPESP) for a scholarship (07/59214-9) and financial support \n(08/53159-9).\n\nReferences\n\nADEOYE , PA., MUSA, JJ. and AKINYEMI, BA., 2009.
