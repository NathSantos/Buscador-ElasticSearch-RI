Devido ao constante crescimento populacional e diante dos novos \n\ndesenvolvimentos tecnol\u00f3gicos tem-se observado uma intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o de atividades humanas com \n\nconsequ\u00eancias nocivas para a sustentabilidade do Sistema Terrestre. O aumento cont\u00ednuo da emiss\u00e3o de \n\ngases que contribuem para o efeito de estufa tem como fonte principal a queima de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis \n\n(CO2), a agricultura intensiva (CH4) e o emprego de gases fluorados industriais. O fen\u00f3meno do \n\naquecimento global \u00e9 considerado uma das maiores amea\u00e7as ambientais do s\u00e9culo XXI.  As altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nclim\u00e1ticas, impulsionadas pelas atividades antropog\u00e9nicas, ter\u00e3o consequ\u00eancias transversais a v\u00e1rias \n\n\u00e1reas da sociedade particularmente na economia, na sa\u00fade e no ambiente, sendo urgente medidas \n\nmitigadoras para que estes impactos n\u00e3o se agravem nas pr\u00f3ximas d\u00e9cadas. De acordo com os cen\u00e1rios \n\nprevistos, \u00e9 muito prov\u00e1vel que no futuro para al\u00e9m do aumento da temperatura m\u00e9dia global, ocorra \n\num aumento do n\u00edvel m\u00e9dio do mar e um incremento na frequ\u00eancia e dura\u00e7\u00e3o de fen\u00f3menos clim\u00e1ticos \n\nextremos, incluindo secas, cheias, precipita\u00e7\u00e3o intensa e ondas de calor. Consequentemente, as \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas ir\u00e3o afetar profundamente os ecossistemas a n\u00edvel global, em especial os \n\necossistemas costeiros.  \n\nOs Estu\u00e1rios s\u00e3o zonas h\u00famidas costeiras muito ricas do ponto de vista biol\u00f3gico, onde ocorre \n\ngrande mistura de \u00e1gua doce e \u00e1gua salgada que facilita a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos, nomeadamente \n\nnas zonas de sapal. As zonas estuarinas, devido \u00e0 sua localiza\u00e7\u00e3o privilegiada e riqueza biol\u00f3gica, t\u00eam \n\natra\u00eddo, desde sempre, a popula\u00e7\u00e3o humana para as suas margens, servindo de localiza\u00e7\u00e3o para as \n\nmaiores metr\u00f3poles do mundo. As a\u00e7\u00f5es antr\u00f3picas que, consequentemente, desde h\u00e1 v\u00e1rias d\u00e9cadas, \n\nestas regi\u00f5es t\u00eam conhecido, de que s\u00e3o exemplos a explora\u00e7\u00e3o excessiva de recursos hali\u00eauticos, o \n\nlan\u00e7amento de res\u00edduos s\u00f3lidos, a eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o causada pela entrada de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, a dragagem e \n\na introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies invasoras, t\u00eam causado impactos negativos. Os sapais t\u00eam grande interesse do \n\nponto de vista econ\u00f3mico, social e ecol\u00f3gico, prestando servi\u00e7os de prote\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 eros\u00e3o costeira e \u00e0 subida \n\ndo n\u00edvel do mar, estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos, habitat para uma diversa variedade de esp\u00e9cies, \n\npurifica\u00e7\u00e3o e reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, remo\u00e7\u00e3o e transforma\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes, oportunidades educacionais e \n\nrecreativas, entre outros, pelo que a sua conserva\u00e7\u00e3o tem, pois, elevada import\u00e2ncia. As plantas de sapal, \n\nnomeadamente plantas hal\u00f3fitas, s\u00e3o de um modo geral, tal como o nome indica, extremamente \n\nresistentes a elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de sal, e a v\u00e1rios stresses ambientais, tais como contamina\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmetais pesados, inunda\u00e7\u00f5es e eventos t\u00e9rmicos extremos. Contudo, apesar da resili\u00eancia demonstrada \n\npor estas plantas, as altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas acopladas com as press\u00f5es antr\u00f3picas ter\u00e3o um profundo \n\nimpacto nos sapais costeiros. A resist\u00eancia e a toler\u00e2ncia das plantas hal\u00f3fitas varia consoante a esp\u00e9cie \n\ne o tipo de stress, ou seja, quando expostas a determinados cen\u00e1rios as esp\u00e9cies mais resistentes \u00e0s novas \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es adquirem vantagem em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s outras, o que poder\u00e1 alterar a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o e frequ\u00eancias \n\ndas esp\u00e9cies dentro do sapal. \n\nNo entanto, esp\u00e9cies com uma ampla distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica e uma grande capacidade de \n\nadapta\u00e7\u00e3o e aclimata\u00e7\u00e3o revelam, normalmente, varia\u00e7\u00f5es morfol\u00f3gicas, fenol\u00f3gicas e fisiol\u00f3gicas entre \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es, de acordo com os condicionamentos locais. Estas plantas podem apresentar, desta forma, \n\ntoler\u00e2ncia cruzada o que permite aumentar a resist\u00eancia a uma gama de diferentes stresses ap\u00f3s a \n\nexposi\u00e7\u00e3o a um espec\u00edfico stress.  Adicionalmente, as plantas, devido \u00e0 heterogeneidade ambiental, \n\npodem exibir varia\u00e7\u00f5es intraespec\u00edficas que iram influenciar a maneira como cada popula\u00e7\u00e3o ir\u00e1 \n\nresponder a futuras altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas. Deste modo, as consequ\u00eancias diretas das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas \n\npodem ter diferentes impactos nas plantas de sapal que apresentam varia\u00e7\u00f5es intraespec\u00edficas, podendo \n\nafetar, de diferente modo, a estrutura e fun\u00e7\u00e3o destas comunidades. \n\n\n\n \n\niii \n\n \n\nEsta tese tem como principais objetivos investigar de que modo, desde logo, o pr\u00e9-\n\ncondicionamento abi\u00f3tico encontrado em diferentes popula\u00e7\u00f5es de hal\u00f3fitas vai influenciar as suas \n\nrespostas ecofisiol\u00f3gicas a stresses abi\u00f3ticos, conjeturados pelas previs\u00f5es locais das altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nclim\u00e1ticas, e, ainda, se estas apresentam uma toler\u00e2ncia cruzada suficientemente significativa de modo \n\na determinar a maneira como o sapal ir\u00e1 evoluir e que consequ\u00eancias ecol\u00f3gicas que poder\u00e1 sofrer.  \n\nMais concretamente, pretendeu-se compreender as consequ\u00eancias das varia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nintraespec\u00edficas, induzidas por pr\u00e9-condicionamento, apresentadas pelas popula\u00e7\u00f5es de duas esp\u00e9cies de \n\nhal\u00f3fitas com uma ampla distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica, a C3 Halimione portulacoides e a invasora C4 Spartina \n\npatens, que colonizam dois sapais vizinhos no estu\u00e1rio do Tejo com diferentes n\u00edveis de metais pesados, \n\nnuma primeira abordagem, face a um aumento de temperatura e numa segunda abordagem, face a um \n\naumento de salinidade. \n\nO estudo da influencia da toler\u00e2ncia cruzada ao stress de calor constituiu a primeira abordagem \n\npara compreender as varia\u00e7\u00f5es ecofisiol\u00f3gicas nas respostas das popula\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00e9-condicionadas e n\u00e3o \n\npr\u00e9-condicionadas a metais pesados de H. portulacoides e S. patens a eventos de calor. Para tal e segundo \n\no \u201cIntergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change\u201d, que indica, com grande certeza, que a frequ\u00eancia e a \n\nintensidade dos eventos de calor aumentar\u00e3o devido ao fen\u00f3meno do aquecimento global, as plantas \n\nforam expostas a um tratamento de calor durante uma semana e, seguidamente, as suas respostas \n\nfisiol\u00f3gicas e bioqu\u00edmicas foram profundamente analisadas. De acordo com os resultados apresentados \n\nna tese, obtidos atrav\u00e9s de medi\u00e7\u00f5es fotobiol\u00f3gicas, de atividade enzim\u00e1tica e ocorr\u00eancia de peroxida\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nlip\u00eddica, acoplando com as analises aos pigmentos e \u00e1cidos gordos, a toler\u00e2ncia cruzada indica que o \n\npr\u00e9-condicionamento a metais pesados influencia significativamente os mecanismos de toler\u00e2ncia ao \n\nstress t\u00e9rmico das plantas hal\u00f3fitas. Constatou-se que H. portulacoides pr\u00e9-condicionado por metais \n\npesados, por toler\u00e2ncia cruzada, apresenta maior resist\u00eancia ao stress de calor que o H. portulacoides \n\ndo sapal n\u00e3o contaminado, por outro lado S. patens, quando pr\u00e9-condicionada por metais pesados, exibe \n\numa pior performance na presen\u00e7a deste stress. \n\nPosteriormente estudou-se a influencia do pr\u00e9-condicionamento a metais pesados na toler\u00e2ncia \n\na aumentos de salinidades em duas popula\u00e7\u00f5es de H. portulacoides e S. patens. A salinidade devido \u00e0s \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, acabar\u00e1 por crescer em consequ\u00eancia do aumento de eventos de tempestade, de \n\nondas de mar\u00e9 e o do n\u00edvel m\u00e9dio do mar. Ao contrario da maioria das plantas, as hal\u00f3fitas podem viver \n\ne prosperar em solos com salinidades at\u00e9 855 mM, contudo as esp\u00e9cies hal\u00f3fitas t\u00eam respostas dispares \n\n\u00e0 mesma salinidade, abrangendo esp\u00e9cies cujo desempenho \u00f3ptimo ocorre em ambientes sem sal at\u00e9 \n\nesp\u00e9cies onde ambientes altamente salinos s\u00e3o ideais. Sendo assim, indiv\u00edduos das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de H. \n\nportulacoides e S. patens dos sapais referidos anteriormente foram expostos a uma variedade de \n\nsalinidades (0 mM NaCl, 400 mM NaCl, 800 mM NaCl) durante uma semana e logo ap\u00f3s o tratamento \n\nforam analisadas fisiol\u00f3gica e bioquimicamente. Os resultados, adquiridos atrav\u00e9s dos mesmos m\u00e9todos \n\nusados no estudo anterior, mostram que o pr\u00e9-condicionamento de metais pesados tem um papel \n\nsignificativo na forma como as plantas responderam aos stresses. Atrav\u00e9s disso, verificou-se que S. \n\npatens pr\u00e9-condicionado a metais pesados apresentou um maior fitness aos ambientes salinos, \n\ncomparando com a popula\u00e7\u00e3o do sapal n\u00e3o contaminado, no entanto H. portulacoides manifestou uma \n\ncomplexa influ\u00eancia n\u00e3o linear \u00e0 toler\u00e2ncia cruzada, uma vez que exibiu, quando pr\u00e9-condicionado, uma \n\nperformance pior quando exposto a 400 mM NaCl enquanto a 800 mM NaCl apresentou um melhor \n\ndesempenho.   \n\nEm resumo, \u00e9 evidente que a halotoler\u00e2ncia e a termotoler\u00e2ncia das plantas anteriormente \n\nestudadas est\u00e3o claramente interligadas com o seu pr\u00e9-condicionamento, apresentando uma toler\u00e2ncia \n\ncruzada significativa, que vai ter um potencial impacto ecol\u00f3gico e poder\u00e1 influenciar a forma como \n\ndois sapais vizinhos ir\u00e3o evoluir. Assim sendo, assumindo que as condi\u00e7\u00f5es a que as plantas foram \n\nexpostas representam as condi\u00e7\u00f5es que, fruto das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, existir\u00e3o no futuro, podemos \n\nconstatar que o sapal contaminado poder\u00e1 ser mais resistente \u00e0 invas\u00e3o por parte do S. patens do que o \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\nsapal n\u00e3o-contaminado, quando impactados por eventos de calor e evidencia, tamb\u00e9m, ser em geral mais \n\nresiliente ao aumento de salinidade. \n\nEm conclus\u00e3o, os resultados deste estudo mostram que o pr\u00e9-condicionamento induz uma \n\ncomplexa varia\u00e7\u00e3o intraespec\u00edfica nos mecanismos de toler\u00e2ncia aos stresses abi\u00f3ticos. Esta varia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nintraespec\u00edfica pode afetar significativamente a maneira como as comunidades de sapais ir\u00e3o evoluir no \n\nfuturo, podendo influenciar, a estrutura e fun\u00e7\u00e3o de cada sapal. Assim, este estudo contribuiu com \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o relevante para o conhecimento de processos ecofisiol\u00f3gicos e pode ser pertinente para \n\nmodelar e prever poss\u00edvel cen\u00e1rios das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas nos sapais, assim como pode ter interesse \n\npara uma gest\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00f5es de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o mais eficiente e especificas para cada sapal.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Halimione portulacoides, Spartina patens, varia\u00e7\u00e3o intraespec\u00edfica, sapal de \n\nAlcochete, sapal do Ros\u00e1rio. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n Climate change is having an increasing effect worldwide, causing weighty disturbances \n\nin virtually all ecosystems thru arising abiotic variations. Salt marshes ecosystems, although highly \n\nresilient, are no exception to the climate shift consequences. Considering halophyte communities \n\nresistence and tolerance to abiotic alterations, climate change still makes them vulnerable to dire \n\nconsequences in their productivity, ending up upsetting the distribution and biodiversity of marsh \n\nvegetation, compromising their economic, social and ecological services and unique role as the \"Kidneys \n\nof the planet\".  \n\nThis project aimed to determine heavy metal cross-tolerance thru pre-conditioning to abiotic \n\nstresses in halophyte plants. Analyzing the influence that adaptations to local conditions have in \n\ntolerance and resistance mechanisms and if this will be relevant in the stress response to the abiotic \n\nvariations predicted in the future climate change and what could this mean for the shifting ecosystems. \n\nFor this, it was studied the physiological responses to abiotic stresses in two different populations of the \n\nwide spread halophyte species, the native C3 Halimione portulacoides and the invasive C4 Spartina \n\npatens, from nearby salt marshes in the Tagus estuary, with the major difference between them being \n\nheavy metal soil content.  \n\nFirstly, on the basis that the frequency and intensity of warming events will rise, in duration and \n\nfrequency, due to global warming, the halophyte plant groups where exposed to a warming event and \n\nthen analyzed photobiologically and biochemically. The cross-tolerance results shown that heavy metal \n\npre-condition enhanced the heat resistance mechanisms in H. portulacoides and worsened S. patens \n\nability to cope with these changes, when compared to their non-pre-conditioned counterparts. This can \n\nhave important consequences in the way the non-contaminated and heavy metal contaminated salt \n\nmarshes will react to environmental changes, that can lead to possibly different ecological consequences. \n\nConsidering the predicted climate change scenarios, it can be claimed that the contaminated marsh can \n\nbe more resistant to invasion than the pristine marshes, were the warming events will benefit the exotic \n\nS. patens in relation to the native H. portulacoides.  \n\nSecondly and taking in to consideration that land salinization is an increasing problem around \n\nthe world and climate change will intensify this phenomenon especially in coastal lands, due to tidal \n\nsurges, storm surges and sea level rise coupled with the increasing evaporation because of global \n\nwarming, the halophyte species from both the studied salt marshes were exposed to a variety of salt \n\ntreatments. When analyzed, the results exposed a noteworthy influence that the heavy metal pre-\n\nconditioned has in the salinity stress responses.  In view of the future changes, it can be argued that \n\nheavy metal contaminated marshes are less resistant to the S. patens increasing colonization when \n\nexposed intermediate salt concentrations and in high salinities both H. portulacoides and S. patens have \n\noverall better salinity tolerance than their counterparts from the non-contaminated marsh. \n\nConcluding, this work shows that the heavy metal pre-conditioning has a complex and \n\nconsiderable influence in the plants tolerance and resistance mechanisms to several abiotic stresses, \n\npresenting an intraspecific physiological variation that can impact how the halophyte communities will \n\nrespond to the upcoming environmental changes. According to our research it can be said that the heavy \n\nmetal contaminated salt marsh will present significantly different ecological damages than their \n\nneighboring salt marsh.  \n\n \n\nKey

Planet earth \n\nis undergoing a clear shift in the climate system, with major consequences to various areas of our society, \n\nfor instance, economic, social and more importantly environmental. According to the Intergovernmental \n\nPanel on Climatic Change Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the influence of human activity in the global \n\nclimate change is undeniable and growing. Human population and economic growth, has been the \n\nforemost cause of the warming observed since mid-20th century mainly due the greatly increased \n\nemissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), observed in the unprecedented increase of the of \n\ncarbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations, leading to an energy uptake, translated to a \n\nwarming of the climate system (IPCC, 2014). Global warming, if mitigation efforts are not conceived, \n\nis expected to cause further alterations to virtually all Earth environments. Under this, very likely, \n\nscenario it is predicted a warming of the global mean surface temperature, rising of the global mean sea \n\nlevel rising, as well as an increase, both in intense and frequency, of extreme climate events such as heat \n\nwaves, droughts and very large precipitation events, both in intense and frequency (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2007; \n\nIPCC, 2014). Consequently, the climate change is very likely to alter the geographical distribution of \n\nentire ecological systems and the variability and distribution of the species they housed. \n\nWetlands are known for being one of the more complex and important ecosystems worldwide, \n\nworking as an interface between the terrestrial and aquatic environments, that occur in intertidal areas, \n\nand are providers of a wide range of essential ecosystem services (Larson et al., 1989). However, \n\nrecently published estimates show that 64% of the world's wetlands have disappeared since 1900 \n\n(Ramsar, 2013). Estuaries are coastal wetlands were the flow of fresh water from the rivers meets the \n\nsalt water of the sea. These ecosystems are characterized by wide environmental fluctuations (tidal cycle, \n\nsalinity, temperature, etc.) however, plants and animals of these ecosystems are perfectly adapted to \n\nendure and thrive under this, normally difficult, abiotic conditions, in fact, estuaries are among the \n\nplanet's most productive ecosystems, even when compared to tropical forests (Longhurst et al., 1995). \n\nAs a result of their privileged localization, unique characteristics and natural richness the estuaries \n\nlocations have, since the beginning of civilization, attracted human populations, according to the \n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, USA), thirty-two of the largest cities in the \n\nworld are located on the coast of an estuary. Consequently, this region has suffered negative impacts \n\nbrought through the anthropogenic action such as dredging, eutrophication due to the input of organic \n\nmatter and nutrients (N and P), excessive siltation due to the intense construction activity, pollution by \n\nsolid waste, such as plastic and other debris and excessive exploitation of fishery resources, as well as \n\nintroduction of invasive species (Carter and Woodroffe, 1995). Salt marshes, characterized by their \n\nhalophyte vegetation, are established in low hydrodynamism estuarine areas and known for providing \n\nimportant ecological and economical services. During tidal flooding, the sediments are trapped by the \n\nvegetation when entering the marsh network causing marsh elevation, capturing the excesses contained \n\nin the environment, storing pollutants and metabolizing them, for this reason they are considered the \n\n\"Kidneys of the planet\" due to their important unique role in water purification (Teixeira et al., 2014). \n\nEven though, in the past, salt marshes had been categorized as mere wastelands, nowadays their global \n\nstatus as a unique ecotone recognized for their key ecological and economical importance, providing \n\nservices regarding coastal erosion and sea-level rising protection, sediment stabilization, habitat for a \n\ndiverse range of species, water purification and retention, removal and transformation of nutrients, \n\neducational and recreational opportunities (Teixeira et al., 2014; Duarte et al., 2017). These aspects \n\nreinforce the interest of these unique systems, in being preserved, used and fostered, either in the \n\ncurrently existing marshes and in the creation of others (Catarino, 1981), since they are considered \n\nnatural methods that contribute to the removal of pollutants, leaving wastewater in better condition.  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nHalophyte vegetation, characteristic to salt marshes, is, by definition, salt-resistant or salt-\n\ntolerant plants that can grow and complete their life cycles in soils or waters containing high salt \n\nconcentrations. These plants present physiological and morphological adaptations that make them able \n\nto thrive in typically highly stressful environments, they are found subjected to elevated levels of abiotic \n\nstresses, displaying considerable tolerance to heavy metal pollution, salinity, extreme thermal events \n\nand flooding (Duarte et al., 2013a; 2013b; 2014; 2015). Despite high salt content in the vegetal tissues, \n\nthey have a high potential for utilization being a cash crop with a numerous economic and ecological \n\napplications and purposes, such as food, fodder, coastal protection and desert revegetation (Lieth et al., \n\n1999; Lieth and Mochtchenko, 2002). Mediterranean salt marshes are dominated by halophyte plants \n\nlike the perennial C3-succulent Halimione portulacoides L. Aellen, and the invasive C4-grass Spartina \n\npatens Ait. Muhl. This plants occupy different vegetation zones within the marsh, being normaly found \n\nin the high-marsh and low-marsh respectively. The predicted climate change will have a profound \n\nphysiological impact in the salt marsh halophytes communities (Simas et al., 2001). Nevertheless, \n\nhalophyte species present different resistances and tolerances to various stresses and, if so, they will \n\nhave unalike responses to the abiotic changes fomented by global warming, moreover it is known that \n\nintraspecific variation as a significant expression within species, especially in wide-raging and highly \n\ntolerant species, that due to environmental pre-conditioning and acclimation to the different abiotic \n\nconditions presented in their various habitats can show physiology, morphology, and phenology \n\nadaptations (Valladares et al., 2007).  Therefore, the direct consequences of climate change can have \n\ndifferent impacts on the distribution and biodiversity of the species within salt marshes, possibly due to \n\nintraspecific variation. \n\nThis project, focused on two salt marshes found in the Tagus Estuary, Alcochete marsh and the \n\nRos\u00e1rio marsh, where the degree of heavy metal contamination (Table 1.1) is the only presumed \n\ndifferent abiotic condition between them. Alcochete salt marsh is located in the northern part of the \n\nTagus Estuary within the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. Ros\u00e1rio salt marsh is located bellow in the \n\nestuary, near the ancient industrial axis Seixal-Montijo. Alcochete is considered a reference site with \n\nsediment metal concentrations very low (Vinagre et al. 2008; Ca\u00e7ador et al. 2009), whereas Ros\u00e1rio salt \n\nmarsh has high levels of metal contamination in its sediments (Duarte et al. 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.1- Total heavy metal concentration (mean s.d., ppm) in the rhizosediment of the three evaluated in both studied salt \n\nmarshes (Duarte et al. 2012). \n\nSpecies Cd Cu Ni Pb Zn \n\nAlcochete      \n\nHalimione portulacoides \n\nSarcocornia fruticose \n\nSpartina maritima \n\n0.001 \u00b1 0.001 \n\n0.003 \u00b1 0.001 \n\n0.002 \u00b1 0.001 \n\n0.003 \u00b1 0.004 \n\n0.040 \u00b1 0.005 \n\n0.011 \u00b1 0.007 \n\n0.004 \u00b1 0.001 \n\n0.011 \u00b1 0.007 \n\n0.011 \u00b1 0.004 \n\n0.024 \u00b1 0.013 \n\n0.058 \u00b1 0.015 \n\n0.048 \u00b1 0.013 \n\n0.026 \u00b1 0.000 \n\n0.088 \u00b1 0.000 \n\n0.129 \u00b1 0.038 \n\nRos\u00e1rio      \n\nHalimione portulacoides \n\nSarcocornia fruticose \n\nSpartina maritima \n\n0.004 \u00b1 0.001 \n\n0.004 \u00b1 0.000 \n\n0.002 \u00b1 0.002 \n\n0.003 \u00b1 0.004 \n\n0.040 \u00b1 0.005 \n\n0.017 \u00b1 0.004 \n\n0.041 \u00b1 0.005 \n\n0.040 \u00b1 0.002 \n\n0.020 \u00b1 0.001 \n\n0.270 \u00b1 0.043 \n\n0.309 \u00b1 0.012 \n\n0.153 \u00b1 0.038 \n\n0.581 \u00b1 0.030 \n\n0.611 \u00b1 0.030 \n\n0.407 \u00b1 0.000 \n\n  \n\n \n\nThe main goal of this study was to investigate the influence heavy metal pre-conditioning \n\nhistories in the ecophysiological response in two neighboring salt marshes to the abovementioned abiotic \n\nstresses predicted through climate change.

Considering the IPCC \n\nclimate change prediction, this understanding is especially important in order to predict future changes \n\nin salt marshes, from an ecosystem approach to a population level. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \nCa\u00e7ador, I., Caetano, M., Duarte, B., Vale, C., 2009.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change, the frequency and intensity of \n\nextreme heat events will rise because of the global warming phenomenon. Halophyte plants, \n\ncharacteristic of the salt marshes and known for being highly tolerant to various abiotic stressors, \n\nnonetheless, heat stress will have a negative impact on the individual when exposed to these warming \n\nevents, however, it has been acknowledged that the tolerance response is different from species to \n\nspecies but also between same species populations. Intraspecific physiological variation is, usually, \n\nfurther expressed in wide ragging species possibly due to their pre-conditioned history. The present \n\nwork aims to determine if C3-succulent Halimione portulacoides and the invasive C4-grass Spartina \n\npatens have been conditioned to exhibit different heat tolerance within comparable same specie \n\npopulations from adjacent locations with unlike soil contamination background. Through physiology \n\nand the photobiology analyses of warming treated samples, cross-tolerance results indicate that heavy \n\nmetal pre-conditioning significantly influence the heat stress tolerance of the tested halophyte plants. \n\nHalimione portulacoides from a heavy metal contaminated salt marsh and S. patens from a non-\n\ncontaminated salt marsh appear to be better prepared to the upcoming consequences of the climate \n\nchange, demonstrating a higher fitness level to warming events. Thus, the pre-conditioning influence \n\nover the tolerance mechanisms can affect the way in which salt marsh communities will evolve in the \n\nfuture, possibly being different through salt marshes. The contaminated marsh can be more resilient to \n\ninvasion than the non-contaminated marsh, since the native species as benefited while the exotic was \n\nimpaired from the heavy metal pre-conditioning. \n\n \n\nKey words: Halimione portulacoides, Spartina patens, warming stress, thermal stress, local \n\nadaptation, intraspecific variability, Alcochete salt marsh, Ros\u00e1rio salt marsh. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n \n\nWetlands systems are known to have a worldwide high economic value and ecological \n\nimportance, encompassing a large scope of ecosystem services (Larson et al., 1989; Woodward et al., \n\n2001). Within wetlands, salt marshes are providers of various and unique globally relevant ecological \n\nand economic services, varying from wildlife conservation and costal defense to water purification \n\n(Teixeira et al., 2014; Duarte et al., 2017). Usually located within marine transitional systems, normally \n\ndensely populated and industrialized areas, the marsh ecosystem is typically dominated by flora adapted \n\nto stressful environments. Halophytes are the typical salt marsh colonizers due to their high tolerance to \n\nvaried abiotic stresses, like flooding (Duarte et al., 2014a), high salinity (Duarte et al., 2013a), heavy \n\nmetal pollution (Duarte et al., 2013b) and extreme heat and cold events (Duarte et al., 2015a), presenting \n\nmorphological and physiological adaptations that allows them to inhabit these adverse environments. \n\nThe Tagus estuary is one of these complex systems, containing various salt marshes that are affected by \n\nvarious degrees of contamination, notably heavy metal contamination mostly due to local industrial \n\nexploration and anthropogenic pollution (Ca\u00e7ador et al., 1996; Ca\u00e7ador et al., 2009; Ca\u00e7ador et al., \n\n2012). Nonetheless, the various parts of the Tagus salt march environments and most of the \n\nMediterranean salt marshes are abundantly colonized by the C3 succulent halophyte Halimione \n\nportulacoides (Chenopodiaceae) and the invasive grass C4 halophyte Spartina patens (Poaceae) original \n\nfrom the Atlantic Coast of North America, making then great marsh study specimens (Ca\u00e7ador et al., \n\n2013; Duarte et al., 2015b; Baumel et al., 2016a). \n\nNowadays in the scientist community, there is a virtual consensus that recent and historical \n\nhuman activity is directly related to the observed climate change and to the unequivocal global warming. \n\nGlobal warming phenomenon is predicted to have a generally negative effect on plant growth due to the \n\ndamaging effect of elevated temperatures on plant development (Hughes, 2000). Regarding the IPCC \n\n(Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change) 5th Assessment Report (AR5), climate change is \n\ndescribed encompassing more than a century of data and analysis of the variations in temperature, \n\nprecipitation, and atmospheric composition and the several other relevant factors, represents a rather \n\ncomplex and tough forecast for the local abiotic changes, impacting differently the various world \n\necosystems and their related plants. This climate change is translated into a global warming that will \n\nresult in a doubtlessly 1.0 to 3.7 \u00b0C increase of the world\u2019s average surface temperature and a surge in \n\nheat waves events both in frequency and duration (Meehl et al., 2007). Heat wave events, as defined by \n\nthe World Meteorological Organization (WMO), is a 5\u00ba Celsius rise of the local maximum temperature \n\nfor six or more successive days, being the normal temperatures constructed defined during between \n\n1960-1991.  \n\nHeat stress, in comparison to the other main natural occurring abiotic stresses, has an \n\nindependent effect on the plant physiology and metabolism (Bita et al., 2013). Plant tolerance to \n\nwarming stress is greatly different between species and can present relevant intraspecific variability, \n\nfurthermore, this tolerance also varies, to a certain extent, with the plant development stage (Martin et \n\nal., 1999; Shah and Huang et al., 2011). At elevated temperatures, long-term exposure may cause \n\ninjuries or death (Schoffl et al., 1999). Plants exposed to heat stress exhibit damages in various \n\nphysiological mechanisms typically translated in the reduction of the photosynthesis activity (Duarte et \n\nal., 2015a, 2015c, 2016b), in the decrease of \u201cusual\u201d protein synthesis, in membrane decay (Weis and \n\nBerry, 1988; Larcher, 2003) among others, thus triggering physiological responses such as the \n\ntranscription and translation of heat shock proteins (HSPs; Bray et al., 2000) and production of \n\nantioxidants and other protective molecules (Maestri et al., 2002). The temperature variation in the \n\nenvironment is sensed by the plants with stets of sensors. The increased fluidity of the membrane leads \n\nto activation of lipid-based signaling cascades and to an increased Ca2+ influx and cytoskeletal \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nreorganization (Saidi et al., 2009). Although the biological behavior and responses to warming are \n\nsimilar between plants, responses to this stressor can vary throughout same species populations. This \n\nintraspecific physiological variation can be observed in a wide range of highly tolerant species, that \n\npossibly due to different pre-conditioning (Gratani and Crescente, 1997; Valladares et al., 2007). \n\nNevertheless, diverse studies indicate significant levels of interpopulation responses variability and little \n\nintrapopulation differentiation (Jump and Penuelas, 2005).  \n\nIn sum, this study intends to evaluate the effects of heavy metal-induced pre-conditioning on \n\nwarming stress responses in two, C3 and C4 widespread, halophytes from two salt marsh populations. \n\nUsing warming-induced changes in two halophytes populations with different pre-conditioning histories \n\n(heavy metal contaminated land versus non-contaminated environment) allowed to explore the different \n\nwarming tolerances by analyzing the significant physiological variances in the response to the elevated \n\ntemperatures, which can show intraspecific variation probably due to habitat variation. Considering the \n\nglobal warming projected by the IPCC report it becomes of foremost importance to identify and assess \n\nfunctional traits in which environmental variability has a significant role in how the species respond to \n\nglobal and local change. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n \n\nStudy Area and Sampling \n\n \n\nThis study sampling was carried out on the Tagus estuary (Figure 2.1), located in the western \n\ncoast of Portugal (38\u00b044?N, 9\u00b003? W), one of the larger estuaries in occidental Europe with an area of \n\napproximately 320 km2. The estuary involves a watershed superior to 80,000 km2 in Spain and Portugal \n\nterritories, being the second most significant hydrological basin in whole Iberian Peninsula. \n\nHalimione portulacoides and Spartina patens sampling was done during low tide in the southern \n\npart of the Tagus estuary on the same day and tidal period, in Alcochete salt marsh (38\u00b045'N, 8\u00b056'W) \n\nsituated within the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve and Ros\u00e1rio salt marsh (38\u00b040'N, 9\u00b001'W) in the \n\nvicinity of a large industrial complex (Figure 2.1). Samples were stored in well-identified plastic bags \n\nand quickly brought to the Marine Botany laboratory, at the Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre \n\n(MARE) site in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon.  \n\nIn the laboratory, plant samples were gently washed to remove dust and sediments. In order to \n\nmake steam cuttings from H. portulacoides samples, the roots and part of the stems were cut, leaving at \n\nleast two nods in the stem below the lowest branch for the development of grafts. The props were \n\nhydroponically cultured in dark-walled vases filled with modified \u00bc Hoagland nutrient solution \n\n(Hoagland and Arnon, 1950). Spartina patens intact tussocks were set in pots filled with perlite and \n\nirrigated with \u00bc Hoagland nutrient solution. Both plant samples were placed in a fitoclimatic chamber \n\nprogrammed to simulate a natural light environment using a sin function (maximum PAR 300 \u00b5mol \n\nphotons m2 s-1, 16/8 h day/night rhythm, 20/18 \u00baC day/night temperature amplitude). Plants were kept \n\nunder this condition for 2 months to acclimate to the new environment and allow root biomass growth \n\nin H. portulacoides. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 0.1- Tagus Estuary map with Alcochete and Ros\u00e1rio salt marshes sampling stations marked. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nExperimental setup \n\n \n\nAfter the adaptation period, plants of both species (H. portulacoides and S. patens) and \n\npopulation (Alcochete and Ros\u00e1rio) were separated into 2 groups with 5 replicates (Table 1) and \n\nsubjected to different thermal treatments (day/night): control (20/18\u00baC) and warming treatment \n\n(35/30\u00baC) in a FitoScope 130 RGBIR chamber (Photon System Instruments, Czech Republic) with \n\ntemperature rise and falls simulating the natural day (maximum PAR 300 \u00b5mol photons m2 s-1, 16/8 h \n\nday/night rhythm). In both treatments the plants sustained with \u00bc Hoagland nutrient solution periodic \n\nirrigation. Treatment trials lasted for 7 days, after which the plants were harvested. All leaf samples for \n\nbiochemical measurements and analysis were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen (N2) and \n\nstored at -80\u00baC. Leaf samples harvested for fatty acid analysis were weighed before freezing. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1- Warming stress experimental design. \n\nWarming Stress \n\n20/18\u00baC (Control) 35/30\u00baC (Warming treatment) \n\nNon-contaminated \n\n(Alcochete) \n\nContaminated \n\n(Ros\u00e1rio) \n\nNon-contaminated \n\n (Alcochete) \n\nContaminated \n\n(Ros\u00e1rio) \nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\n \n\n \n\nPulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry \n\n \n\nModulated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were made in attached leaves with a \n\nFluoroPen FP100 PAM (Photo System Instruments, Czech Republic). All the measurements in the dark-\n\nadapted state were made after darkening of the leaves for at least 30 min. The minimal fluorescence (F0) \n\nin darkadapted state was measured by the measuring modulated light, which was sufficiently low (&lt;0.1 \n\n\u00b5mol m-2 s-1) not to induce any significant variation in fluorescence. The maximal fluorescence level \n\n(FM) in dark-adapted state was measured by a 0.8 second saturating pulse at 8000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. The \n\nmaximum photochemical efficiency was assessed as (FM-F0)/FM. The same parameters were also \n\nmeasured in light \u2013adapted leaves, being F\u20190 the minimum fluorescence, F\u2019M the maximum fluorescence \n\nand the operational photochemical efficiency. Rapid light curves (RLC) measurements, in dark-adapted \n\nleaves, were attained using the preprogramed LC1 protocol of the FluoroPen, consisting in a sequence \n\nof pulses from 0 to 500 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. Shortly, this protocol is based in successive measurements of the \n\nsample ?PS II under various light intensities (20, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 500 ?mol m\n-2 s- 1) of continuous \n\nillumination relating the rate of photosynthesis to photon flux density (PAR). During this protocol the \n\nF0 and FM as well as the maximum photochemical efficiency were measured. Each ?PS II measurement \n\nwas used to calculate the electron transport rate (ETR) through photosystem II using the following \n\nequation: ETR = ?PS II x PAR x 0.5, where PAR is the actinic photosynthetically active radiation \n\ngenerated by the FluoroPen and 0.5 assumes that the photons absorbed are equally partitioned between \n\nPS II and PSI (Genty et al., 1989). Without knowledge of the actual amount of light being absorbed, \n\nfluorescence measurements can only be used as an approximation for electron transport (Beer et al., \n\n1998a, Beer et al., 1998b and Runcie and Durako, 2004). Rapid light curves (RLC) were generated from \n\nthe calculated ETRs and the irradiances applied during the rapid light curve steps. Each RLC was fitted \n\nto a double exponential decay function in order to quantify the characteristic parameters, alpha and \n\nETRmax (Platt et al., 1980). The initial slope of the RLC (?) is a measure of the light harvesting efficiency \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nof photosynthesis and the asymptote of the curve, the maximum rate of photosynthesis (ETRmax), is a \n\nmeasure of the capacity of the photosystems to utilize the absorbed light energy (Marshall et al., 2000). \n\nThe onset of light saturation (Ek) was calculated as the ratio between ETRmax and ?. Excitation light of \n\n650 nm (peak wavelength) from array of three light and emitting diodes is focused on the surface of the \n\nleaf to provide a homogenous illumination. Light intensity reaching the leaf was 3000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1, \n\nwhich was sufficient to generate maximal fluorescence in all individuals. The fluorescence signal is \n\nreceived by the sensor head during recording and is digitized in the control unit using a fast-digital \n\nconverter. The OJIP transient (or Kautsky curves) depicts the rate of reduction kinetics of various \n\ncomponents of PS II. When dark-adapted leaf is illuminated with the saturating light intensity of 3500 \n\n\u00b5mol m-2 s-1 then it exhibits a polyphasic rise in fluorescence (OJIP). Each letter reflects distinct \n\ninflection in the induction curve. The level O represents all the open reaction centres at the onset of \n\nillumination with no reduction of QA (fluorescence intensity lasts for 10 ms). The rise of transient from \n\nO to J indicates the net photochemical reduction of QA (the stable primary electron acceptor of PS II) to \n\nQA? (lasts for 2 ms). The phase from J to I was due to all reduced states of closed RCs such as QA? QB?, \n\nQA QB\n2? and QA? QB H2 (lasts for 2\u201330 ms). The level P (300 ms) coincides with maximum \n\nconcentration of QA? QB\n2 with plastoquinol pool maximally reduced. The phase P also reflects a balance \n\nbetween light incident at the PS II side and the rate of utilization of the chemical (potential) energy and \n\nthe rate of heat dissipation (Zhu et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n \n\nPigment profiling \n\n \n\nPigments analysis used the previously harvested H. portulacoides and S. patens leaf samples \n\nthat were flash-frozen and stored at -80\u00baC. The samples were then freeze-dried in the dark during 48h \n\non a Telstar laboratory freeze dryer (Cryodos-45). Subsequently, the freeze-dried leaf samples were set \n\ninto their respectively appropriately labeled plastic test tube, with the help of a glass rod, ground into a \n\npowder and afterward it was added 5ml of pure acetone. To ensure complete disaggregation of the leaf \n\nmaterial, the test tubes containing the samples were then subjected to a cold ultra-sound bath for at least \n\n2-min. The samples were immediate, stored at -20\u00baC freezer and the pigments were extracted for 24h, \n\nsamples were kept in in the dark to prevent pigment degradation. Following the extraction, the samples \n\nwere placed in a centrifuge set at 4000 rpm at 4\u00baC and centrifuged for 15min. After which, samples were \n\nscanned from 350 nm to 750 nm in 1 nm steps, using a dual beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV/VIS \n\nUV1601 Spectrophotometer). Finally, the detected pigment sample absorption spectra were analyzed \n\nand quantified employing Gauss-Peak Spectra (GPS) method (Kupper et al., 2007). The sample \n\nspectrum was analyzed, through the GPS fitting library, using SigmaPlot Software. This method is based \n\non the sample spectrum fitting, by a linear combination, to the Gauss-peak spectra, that describes each \n\npigment in the detected spectrum, identifying the samples pigment profile, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, \n\nautoxantihin, antheraxanthin, ?-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin. \n\nFor a better evaluation of the light harvesting and photoprotection mechanisms, the De-\n\nEpoxidation State (DES) was calculated as: \n\nDES= ([Antheraxanthin]+[Zeaxanthin]) / ([Violaxanthin] + [Antheraxanthin] + [Zeaxanthin]) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nLeaf fatty acid composition \n\n \n\nLeaf fatty acid analyses were performed by direct trans-esterification of the previous weighed \n\nleaf samples as previously described (Matos et al., 2007; Duarte et al., 2017). First, leaf samples were \n\nplaced into the glass tubes, in a water bath set at 70 \u00baC, containing the internal standard heptadecanoate \n\n(C17:0), methanol and sulphuric acid. Leaf samples were kept in the heated water bath, extracting for \n\none hour after which were cooled down. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were extracted adding \n\ndiethyl ether or light petroleum and water, subsequently centrifuged at 4000 rpm during 5 min. With the \n\nhelp of a glass Pasteur pipette, the upper layer was transferred to a test tube with a tapering bottom and \n\neventually dried with the aid of a stream of nitrogen while heated by a water bath set to 37 \u00baC. After the \n\ncompletion of the evaporation, it was added of 50\u00b5l of hexane to the glass tube dry matter residue. \n\nFinally, the FAMEs were separated and identified, when injected 1 \u00b5l of the solution into the gas \n\nchromatograph (Varian 3900, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a hydrogen flame-ionization detector \n\nusing a fused silica 0.25 mm i.d. x 50 m capillary column (WCOT Fused Silica, CP-Sil 88 for FAME; \n\nVarian). \n\n \n\n \n\nAnti-oxidant enzyme assays \n\n \n\nEnzyme extractions of H. portulacoides and S. patens leaf samples retrieved from their -80\u00baC \n\nstorage were performed according to Tiryakioglu et al. (2006), at 4\u00baC. The fresh leaves were \n\nhomogenized in 50mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) supplemented with 0.1 mM Na-EDTA in a \n\nceramic mortar with a proportion of 500 mg to 8 ml respectively. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8 \n\n923 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant transferred to a test tube and used for the anti-\n\noxidant enzyme analyses.  \n\nThe enzyme activity measurements of catalase (CAT, EC.1.11.1.6.), Ascorbate peroxidase \n\n(APx, E.C. 1.11.1.11), Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, E.C. 1.11.1.7) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD E.C. \n\n1.15.1.1) were performed in a dual beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV/VIS UV1601 \n\nSpectrophotometer) using quartz cuvettes. Catalase activity assays were performed according to the \n\nmethod of Teranishi et al. (1974). An aliquot of 100 \u00b5l of extract was added to the reaction solution, \n\nconsisting in a mixture with 50 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM of Na-EDTA, and \n\n100 mM of H2O2, in order to start the reaction. Catalase activity was then measured by analyzing the \n\ncapacity of H2O2 consumption during 60 seconds at 25 \u00baC, and consequent decrease in absorbance at \n\n240 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 39.4 mM-1 cm-1). Ascorbate peroxidase was measured according \n\nto Tiryakioglu et al. (2006), by observing the absorbance reduction, monitored at 290 nm for 60 seconds \n\n(molar extinction coefficient of 2.8 mM-1 cm-1). The reaction was initiated by adding 100 \u00b5l of the plant \n\nextract to the reaction mixture consisting in 50 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 12 mM of \n\nH2O2 and 0.25 mM L-ascorbate. Guaiacol peroxidase measurement was performed according to \n\nBergmeyer (1974). A reaction solution was made, containing 50 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH \n\n7.0), 50 mM of H2O2 and 100 \u00b5l of enzyme extract. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 20 \n\nmM of guaiacol. The activity was recorded by an increase in absorbance during 60 seconds at 470 nm \n\n(molar extinction coefficient of 26.6 mM-1 cm-1). Superoxide dismutase total activity was assayed \n\naccording to the method of Marklund (1974), by measuring the oxidation rate of pyrogallol monitored \n\nat 325 nm for 2 minutes. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 10 \u00b5L of enzyme extract to the \n\nreaction mixture, consisting of 50 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM of Na-EDTA, 3 \n\nmM of pyrogallol, ultrapure water. The autoxidation of pyrogallol was read without enzymatic extract \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nduring the same period and time interval for comparison enabling. Protein quantification was determined \n\nusing the Bradford (1976) method.  \n\n \n\nMembrane lipid peroxidation \n\n \n\nMembrane lipid peroxidation quantification was performed in H. portulacoides and S. patens \n\nleaf samples according to Heath and Packer (1968). First, leaf sample matter was homogenized in \n\npreviously made TBA/TCA solution, that contains 20% Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 0.5% \n\nThiobarbituric acid (TBA), as a proportion of 100mg of leaf fresh weight to 2ml of acid solution.

Since the mid-twentieth century the surge of extreme warming events is evident, and, in \n\nsome places, this recurrence has doubled (IPCC, 2014). Twenty-first-century climate model projections \n\nconcluded that the region that encompasses and surrounds the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East \n\nis a critical area with an immense propensity for environmental changes (Tanarhte et al, 2012; Zittis et \n\nal, 2016). Due to the future abiotic changes to the Mediterranean ecosystem, it is fair to assume \n\ninevitable imposition of environmental stresses that will alter the biodiversity and distribution of various \n\necosystems. As with any kind of new stressed environments, plants well adapted to harsh conditions, \n\nsuch as salt marsh flora, will be potentially more suitable to new climate realities (Duarte et al. 2013a, \n\n2014a, 2015). Plant populations exposed to land heterogeneity can have a different response when new \n\nstress factors are introduced. This can happen when comparing the responses between different \n\nconditioned species to different environments, for example, a pre-conditioned species to a more stressful \n\nenvironment may have acquired functional traits that may have a determinant role in plant response to \n\nglobal change, as well as on the ecological consequences at an ecosystem level for the competition \n\nbetween wild and invasive species (Parmasen, 2006; Matesanz et al., 2010). Considering this, \n\nenvironmental changes are impactful within ecosystems leading to potential modifications of the habitat \n\navailable for colonization. This can happen in salt marshes settings where species distribution is \n\nfrequently modulated by marsh elevation. The salt marsh zonation is based on their topography, \n\nclassified and defining several distinct areas, the low, medium and high areas, directly related to yearly \n\nrate of tidal submergences (Adam, 1990), which is a crucial to marsh flora succession, affecting the \n\nsediment flooding, redox potential, pH and salinity (Silvestri et al., 2005). Nevertheless, warming events \n\naffect all the marsh flora indiscriminately. Assuming, based on the IPCC reports, that warming events \n\nwill be more frequent and long it becomes important to address the physiological mechanisms that \n\nconfer resistance and tolerance to warming stress and if this can be significantly influenced by pre-\n\nconditioning to other stress. Comparing the physiological results of warming stress in two populations \n\nof two widely spread halophyte species, under different environmental pre-conditions provides essential \n\ninformation on plant response to new environmental factors fluctuations including climate change and \n\nthe importance of intraspecific variability. \n\nReviewing the photobiological light harvesting processes results, H. portulacoides populations \n\npresented similar responses to warming treatment, reflecting well-adjusted heat tolerance processes. \n\nThere was no meaningful change in the photosystem II operational and maximum quantum yield. \n\nFurthermore, maximum electron transport rates (ETRmax) and general photosynthetic light harvesting \n\nefficiency (?) expanded significantly with warming treatment, bolstered by the relative electron \n\ntransport rate at each light intensity (rETR). The chlorophyll fluorescence transient analysis suggests \n\nmechanisms that allow the maintenance of H. portulacoides photosynthetic efficiency. Nevertheless, it \n\ncan be suggested that H. portulacoides population from the heavy metal contaminated location has a \n\nbetter performance when observing the slightly healthier values in the rapid light curves and derived \n\nparameters, such as the ETRmax and photosynthetic efficiency. This inference is supported by the lower \n\nenergy dissipation values (DI/CS), indicating a higher efficiency in the electronic transport. The \n\nrelationship between the active OECs increase and the K-step amplitude decrease found in the H. \n\nportulacoides from both locations when warming treated can be used as evidence of highly efficient \n\nmechanisms to the imposed stress, indicating as well that the oxygen evolving complex of PS II function \n\nwas not damaged by the changed conditions (Duarte et al., 2016b), nonetheless, OECs and K-step \n\namplitude showed significances in their variation in the warming treated contaminated site samples, \n\npossibly signifying a better OEC warming-stability. Still, the indication of warming stress damage is \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nreinforced by negative impacts relative to the decrease of the Kautsky curves in the warming exposed \n\nsamples. Regarding warming stress effects on photosynthetic electron transport, the decrease of \n\nfluorescence in the Kautsky curves was the result of the decrease in quinone pool size. Quinone pool \n\nreduction in heat stressed leaves can be acquiescent examining the limitation of the electron transport \n\nrate, that in PS II acceptor side presented a significant reduction, considering the enactment of PS I \n\ncyclic electron transport. A cyclic flow is known to be essential for the maintenance of the correct ratio \n\nof ATP/NADPH production and the prevention of stroma over-reduction (Joly et al., 2007; Munekage \n\net al., 2004; Pshybytko et al., 2008). Thus, warming stress consequences also revealed, in both H. \n\nportulacoides populations, a significant decrease in absorbed energy flux (ABS/CS), trapped energy \n\nflux (TR/CS), electron transport energy flux (ET/CS) and available reaction centers (RC/CS), \n\nnonetheless the decrease seen in the contaminated site population trapped energy flux and in their \n\navailable reaction centers was less significative indicating a better warming tolerance, presenting less \n\ndamage in overall energy fluxes. This can be supported by the visible increase in net rate of PS II reaction \n\nof RC closure in the samples from the non-contaminated location, in contrast to the decrease found in \n\nthe heavy metal pre-conditioned samples (Chen and Cheng 2009). Furthermore, considering the \n\ndamages in warming stress of the energy fluxes in PS II and the PS I energy flux enhancement, acquired \n\nby observing the increase displayed in ?R0 of both treated sample groups, it can be concluded that PS I \n\nis warming resistance in comparison to the more warming unstable PS II mechanisms (Duarte et al., \n\n2015a). Considering that H. portulacoides is native from the Mediterranean, from North Africa to Great \n\nBritain, is naturally adapted to warmer weather, this can explain the high physiological tolerance \n\ndisplayed by this species when exposed to heat events. \n\nPAM fluorometry acquired data, in both S. patens populations exposed to warming treatment, \n\npresented a significant rise in PS II maximum and operational quantum efficiency in both sample \n\npopulations as well as a rise in photosynthetic efficiency and maximum electron transport rates. These \n\nresponses indicated a well-adapted response to elevated temperatures as shown in previous studies \n\n(Duarte et al., 2016), this may be related to the fact that S. patens is a Tagus estuary invasive species \n\nthat is originally from a relatively warmer climate (Lonard et al. 2010). In fact, nowadays it is accepted \n\nthat the expansion of S. patens in Tagus estuary is slowed down by a climatic mischief of this specie to \n\nits new invaded environment (Duarte et al., 2015b) Concerning the photosynthetic electron transport \n\nchains in S. patens from the contaminated location, was observed a decrease in Kautsky curve \n\nfluorescence, possibly due to the detected decrease in the oxidized quinone pool size (Pshybytko et al., \n\n2008). Heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens\u2019 oxygen evolving complexes (OECs) appear to be \n\ntemperature insensitive, on the other hand, non-contaminated site population showed a decrease in K-\n\nstep amplitude and an increase in the number of active oxygen-evolving complexes, in fact, under heat \n\nstress K-step is exclusively related to PS II OECs (Srivastava et al., 1997), with this it can be assumed \n\nthat S. patens from the non-contaminated location have a better performance under warming exposure. \n\nAlso, results in phenomenological fluxes present significant variations between S. patens populations \n\nresponse to warming stress. There was found sight variations in warming exposed non-contaminated \n\nsite samples, on the other hand, on S. patens from the contaminated location, possible due to quinone \n\nsize reduction, showed a significant reduction of electron transport energy flux (ET/CS), absorbed \n\nenergy flux (ABS/CS), trapped energy flux (TR/CS), available reaction centers (RC/CS) and energy \n\ndissipation values (DI/CS). This significantly different response should lead to bigger consequences in \n\nthe population from the heavy metal contaminated location than those found in the analyses, however, \n\nwhen considering the substantially different phenomenological fluxes values found in the control \n\npopulations, it was observed that the energy fluxes changes in contaminated site population result with \n\nsimilar values in both warming exposed population. Fluorescence measurements data provided evidence \n\nthat S. patens from the non-contaminated and contaminated locations have similar performances when \n\nexposed to warming conditions, demonstrated by the evident increase in photosynthetic similarities in \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nwarming adapted S. patens. However, it can be argued that the bigger variations detected in the \n\nphenomenological energy fluxes parameters of the heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens reveals a \n\nsuperior biological effort when responding to the warming stress compared to the population from the \n\nnon-contaminated location. \n\nIn halophytic species exposed to abiotic stresses, it is common to observe the activation of the \n\nxanthophyll cycle (Duarte et al., 2013a, 2014a, 2014b, 2016) a photoprotective mechanism, induced due \n\nto a crucial drop down in the luminal pH. The de-epoxidation of the luminal violaxanthin pool towards \n\nzeaxanthin reduces the overload of the photosynthetic light harvesting mechanism, through energy \n\ndissipation of excess reducing power accumulated within the stroma (Demmig-Adams, 1990). Heat \n\nstressed H. portulacoides showed a decrease in all carotenoids, except non-pre-conditioned individuals \n\npresented a significant increase in the concentration of auroxanthin, a violaxanthin analog that acts as \n\nan efficient energy quencher, however the highly significant increase of the DES index, known to be a \n\nevident signal of xanthophyll cycle activity, can possibly indicate a lesser presence of the xanthophyll \n\ncycle in the plants from the non-contaminated environment (Duarte et al., 2013a). The lack of activated \n\ncarotenoids driven warming tolerance mechanisms in heavy metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides, \n\ndid not appear to have any negative effects in the management of the LHC or in the photosynthetic \n\nefficiency, so it can be concluded that H. portulacoides from the contaminated location has better \n\nwarming resistance. Nevertheless, both populations showed an increase in the total carotenoid to total \n\nchlorophyll ratio, indicating a plant activity shift from light harvesting to photoprotection (Wentworth \n\net al., 2000). Warming exposed S. patens from the contaminated site showed xanthophyll cycle \n\nactivation and activity shift to photoprotection due to total carotenoid to total chlorophyll ratio rise, \n\nnonetheless xanthophyll cycle is defective according to the significant increase in DES, on the other \n\nhand, the non-contaminated site S. patens group conditions for xanthophyll cycle did not arise, however \n\nhighly significant rises in ?-carotene and lutein pigment concentrations were observed in both \n\npopulations, two typical anti-oxidant carotenoids acting as a possible countermeasure against ROS \n\n(Duarte et al., 2013a). Moreover, pre-conditioned S. patens exhibited a highly significant increase in the \n\nchlorophyll degradation index indicating a worse light harvesting stress response than in the non-\n\npreconditioned individuals that presented no significant changes in the index when warming treated.  \n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging analysis are of great consequence because \n\nenvironmental stresses can cause the accumulation of this reactive oxygen species in tissues being \n\nharmful to plants, thus their detoxification is of major importance to plant cell metabolism. In fact, ROS \n\nare routinely generated during normal cellular metabolic processes, yet they are also known to be \n\nsignaling molecules that can activate physiological responses to many common and frequent abiotic \n\nstresses (Tripathy and Oelm\u00fcller, 2012). Throughout these pathways, plants have developed an effective \n\nantioxidative mechanism, with enzymatic components coupled with mechanism driven by pigment \n\nconversions (Jithesh et al., 2006). Nonetheless no warming treated sample groups, neither H. \n\nportulacoides nor S. patens, shown any active line of enzymatic defense. The reduction displayed in the \n\nanti-oxidant enzymes of the heat stressed S. patens led to a poor and inefficient scavenging mechanism \n\nof the ROS species, observed in the highly significant increase of the lipid peroxidation, an indicator of \n\noxidative cellular damage. Furthermore, taking into consideration that the increase of lipid peroxidation \n\nis higher in the pre-conditioned samples, it can be argued that the S. patens population from the non-\n\ncontaminated marsh displays less damage and superior tolerance mechanisms to ROS. On the other \n\nhand, the defense against ROS species in H. portulacoides appears to be efficient due to the maintenance \n\nof the lipid peroxidation levels within warming exposed plants. However, non-pre-conditioned \n\nindividuals presented the activation of the xanthophyll cycle couple with the increase production of \n\nauroxanthin to efficiently perform ROS scavenging, none the less the pre-conditioned individuals did \n\nnot show significant anti-oxidant mechanisms, and with the reduction of auroxanthin, other common \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nROS scavenging mechanism, it can be indicated that pre-conditioned H. portulacoides displays a better \n\nresistance then its counterpart from the non-contaminated location.  \n\nObserving the plants fatty acid profile, we can confer that H. portulacoides and S. patens belong \n\nto 18:3 group of plants in terms of fatty acid metabolism. Halimione portulacoides warming-exposed \n\npopulations presented similar fatty acid profile responses. Both populations shown a highly significant \n\nincrease in oleic acid (C18:1), known for improving the stabilization of light-harvesting complex \n\n(Siefermann-Harms and Angerhofer, 1998). The findings corroborate the results that indicated light \n\nharvesting stress, shown in the decrease of the chl a/ chl b ratio and the increase of the above mentioned \n\ntotal carotenoid to total chlorophyll ratio of the heat stressed H. portulacoides. When comparing the \n\nC18:1 to chl a/ chl b ratio there is a negative significant correlation (r2 = -0,84; P<0,05) in the individuals \n\nfrom the non-contaminated marsh and (r2 = -0,89; P<0,05) in the pre-conditioned samples, this suggests \n\nthat in order to reduce LHC stress there is an increase in the synthetization of the oleic acid (Duarte et \n\nal., 2015c). Palmitic acid (C16:0), recognized for having a key role and integral part in PS II functioning \n\n(Gounaris and Barber, 1985) shown a highly significant increase. One of the typical heat stress \n\nmanifestations is tissue senescence, characterized by cellular membrane damage linked to a fluidity \n\nincrease of the membrane lipids, lipid peroxidation, and protein debasement in different metabolic \n\nprocedures (Savchenko et al., 2002). The substantial decrease in linolenic acid (C18:3) happen due to \n\nthe increase in the content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, in order to maintain membrane \n\nfluidity, adjusting their metabolism in direct response to the warming stress (Zhang et al.,2005). In this \n\nmanner, the expansion of the saturation level of fatty acids seems, by all accounts, to be critical for the \n\nmaintenance of the membrane stability and heat tolerance upgrading (Larkindale and Huang, 2004), \n\nnonetheless these fatty acid tolerance mechanisms when seen more efficient in the pre-conditioned \n\nindividuals and coupled with the highly significant increase in the total fatty acid content, it can be \n\nargued that the H. portulacoides from the heavy metal contaminated salt marsh has a superior tolerance \n\nto heat stress. Warming feedbacks were similar between S. patens population, as well as no evident \n\nwarming specific fatty acid indicator was shown, possibly indicating no membrane structural damage. \n\nPalmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) suffered a significant rise, probably for the benefit of \n\noverall PS II function and more specific PS II light-harvesting complexes stabilization (Siefermann-\n\nHarms and Angerhofer, 1998) respectively. Considering the warming stress in both populations, the \n\nLHC stress response were different between populations. Oleic acid when compared with chl a/b ratio, \n\na common stress indicator, exhibited a negative correlation in the samples from the non-contaminated \n\n(r2 = -0,75; P<0,05) and contaminated (r2 = -0,83; P<0,05) locations, although non-pre-conditioned \n\nindividuals also displayed an increase in carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio, indicating an enhancing the \n\nlight harvesting efficiency and reducing the stress, to corroborated this findings it was found a positive \n\ncorrelation between C18:1 and chl a/b ratio in the individuals from the non-contaminated (r2 = 0,928; \n\nP<0,05), in turn pre-conditioned samples as expected did not presented a correlation (r2 = 0,83; P<0,05), \n\nthe difference in LHC stress response is seen observing the chl a/b ratio decrease, that is significant and \n\nvery significant in the S. patens from the non-contaminated and the heavy metal contaminated salt marsh \n\nrespectively. Thru this data it can be claim that the non-pre-conditioned S. patens population as a \n\nsuperior warming stress response than its counterpart.\n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nConclusions \n \n\nThe findings here obtained, support the understanding that halophyte plants are known to be \n\ntolerant to a wide range of abiotic stresses, possessing highly efficient mechanisms that allow them to \n\ncolonize inherently hostile habitats just like the sampled salt marshes. This study has shown that thermal \n\nstress in both, the C3 Halimione portulacoides and the C4 Spartina patens, halophytes species presented \n\na complex intraspecific variation of their biophysical stress responses imposed through environmental \n\nwarming, related to local adaptation to other stress due to different habitat conditions presented in the \n\npopulations.  \n\nOur data suggest that although H. portulacoides from both populations showed overall negative \n\nimpacts to warming events. Nonetheless, heavy metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides displayed less \n\ndamage in the physiological and the photobiological mechanisms than its non-contaminated site \n\ncounterpart, revealing to have better warming tolerance. Photobiological light harvesting processes \n\nappear to have a higher efficiency in the H. portulacoides from the heavy metal contaminated location, \n\npresenting less damage to the photosystem II electronic transport and energy flux. Considering \n\nphotoprotective mechanisms, the xanthophyll cycle seems to be only needed in the non-contaminated \n\nsite H. portulacoides, when observing no more damage or photoinhibition in H. portulacoides from the \n\ncontaminated location it appears that non-contaminated site H. portulacoides are possibly more \n\nphotosensitive. Spartina patens results suggests a high tolerance for temperature increase stress in both \n\npopulations. Nonetheless, an argument can be made indicating a better and more efficient warming \n\nadaptation in S. patens sourced from the non- contaminated environment. Regarding photobiology, it \n\ncan be detected an improvement in the PS II oxygen-evolving complexes in the non-contaminated site \n\nS. patens as well as being, apparently, warming insensitive, the same thus not applied in S. patens from \n\nthe heavy metal contaminated location, presenting various significant photobiological mechanisms \n\nchanges. The heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens, when comparing to S. patens from the non-\n\ncontaminated environment, also appear to show the poorest warming tolerance with an apparent photo-\n\noxidative stress vulnerability as well as a less competent reactive oxygen species scavenging \n\nmechanisms.  \n\nAssuming that the IPCC predictions are accurate, the heat wave phenomenon will be \n\nsubstantially aggravated, in frequency and duration, by the ongoing climate change that is expected to \n\nhave a great impact in plant distribution and abundance in the world\u2019s salt marsh ecosystem, as well as \n\nplant community distribution (Walther et al., 2002). Different responses to extreme climate events can \n\noccur between plant species especially those that have a wide-ranging geographical distribution (Jump \n\nand Penuelas, 2005) just as the plant species addressed in this study. Our findings suggest that H. \n\nportulacoides from a heavy metal contaminated salt marsh and S. patens from a non-contaminated salt \n\nmarsh to there are better suited for the upcoming environmental reality, being more warming tolerant \n\nthan their counterparts. Therefore, in the heavy metal contaminated marsh in comparison to the non-\n\ncontaminated marsh, climate change appears to affect negatively the C4 invasive S. patens heat tolerance \n\nwhile increasing the performance of the C3 native H. portulacoides to warming events, which can \n\ndissuade the invasion trend showed by the S. patens, hence cross-tolerance favors the native species in \n\nthe heavy metal contaminated environment. The same cannot be said in non-contaminated marsh, \n\nwhereas climate change will promote the invasion of the exotic species.  \n\nThus, environmental pre-conditioning observed in this species can be considered to have an \n\nimportant influencing factor in how the plant tolerance mechanisms respond to abiotic changes, varying \n\nsignificantly in accordance with their environmental histories.   \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nReferences \n \n\nAdam, P., 1990.

Water and soil salinity is predicted to \n\nincrease thru the rising storm and tidal surges and sea level rising, currently millions of people live in \n\nlow elevation costal-lands with risk of salinization. Nearly all plants are significantly damage or die \n\nwhen exposed to high salt concentration, on the other hand halophyte plants, typically encountered in \n\nsalt marshes, are able to live and thrive in soil salinities up to 855mM.  Nevertheless, halophyte species \n\nexperience between then a difference in their salt tolerance range and optimal salinity, this is a \n\ndetermined factor in the plant distribution through the marsh. Additionally, intraspecific variation to \n\nNaCl response is commonly observed in high raging halophyte species, possibly due to population \n\nconditioned by local abiotic factors that can influence the overall plant physiology, therefore the pre-\n\nconditioning influence becomes meaningful to understand the evolution of salt marsh ecology through \n\nthe expected consequences of climate change. In order to comprehend this implication this study aimed \n\nto understand if a different environmental condition will change the way salt marsh species react when \n\nexposed to a range of high salinities, analyzing the effects that salt stress as on the physiology and the \n\nphotobiology. The results show that heavy metal pre-conditioning has a significant and complex role in \n\nchanging the salt tolerance mechanism of C3-succulent Halimione portulacoides and the invasive C4-\n\ngrass Spartina patens. Therefore, the pre-condition history of halophyte populations appears to have \n\ngreatly influence their future distribution outcome. Whereas at a soil salinity of 400mM, the non-pre-\n\nconditioned invasive individuals can display a disadvantage in the salt tolerance when compared to those \n\nbelonging to the population from the heavy metal contaminated location and at 800mM NaCl both heavy \n\nmetal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides and S. patens appear to have a higher fitness when compared to \n\nthe species their counterparts from the non-contaminated marsh. Thus, the contaminated salt marsh can \n\nbe not only more less resilient to the S. patens colonization, but their halophyte species can be overall \n\nmore salt tolerant due to their heavy metal pre-conditioning. \n\n \n\nKey words: Halimione portulacoides, Spartina patens, salinity stress, salt tolerance, local \n\nadaptation, intraspecific variability, Alcochete salt marsh, Ros\u00e1rio salt marsh. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n \n\nAccording to the latest IPCC report, the analysis of the data gathered, through this and the last \n\ncentury, a worldwide intensification of abiotic stresses, such as the increase and intensity of extreme \n\nclimate events, droughts, floods, sea level rising, water and land salinity variations are extremely likely \n\nwith alarming environmental and economic implications (IPCC, 2014). Earth can be considered a salt \n\nplanet since approximately, 97.5% of all planet\u2019s water content is salt water, occupying roughly 70% of \n\nthe surface encompassed in oceans, lake and groundwater (Shiklomanov, 2009), additionally, it has been \n\nestimated that high soil salinity is affecting 20% of total Earth\u2019s land surface and 33% of agricultural \n\nirrigated lands (Glick et al., 2007, Shrivastava et al., 2014). Therefore, it can be presumed that soil and \n\nwater salinity induced stress is and will be one of the major abiotic stresses. Usually, salt stress in plants \n\nis a powerful limiting production factor, upsetting every major crop development and productivity \n\n(Bacilio et al., 2004). Furthermore, most crops plants, generally, cannot grow in soils with NaCl \n\nconcentrations higher than 40mM NaCl (Munns, 2005; Jamil et al., 2011). The constant increase in the \n\nworld population results in higher food demand that leads to a more excessive irrigation practices to \n\nmatch the need for agricultural production hence contributing to the progressive land salinization. In \n\ncoastal regions, especially in the high populated estuaries, climate change will likely increase, at an \n\nelevated rate, the soil and water salinity, mostly due to predicted storm surges, tidal surges and sea level \n\nrise causing an onward saltwater land inundation (Dasgupta and Hossain et al., 2015). Nowadays more \n\nthan 600 million people live in considerable salinization risk areas, inhabiting low-elevation coastal \n\nlands (Wheeler, 2011). This presents a severe threat not only to coastal ecosystems but also to the \n\nagriculture, aquaculture and freshwater availability jeopardizing the sustainability of the growing human \n\npopulation (Flowers, 2004). Most of the crop plants when exposed to NaCl concentrations from 40 mM \n\nto 200 mM become severely damage or die, plants exposed to elevated salt concentrations result in \n\nseveral complex biochemical, physiological, and morphological damages, such as nutrient uptake and \n\nassimilation. (Munns and Tester, 2008; Akbarimoghaddam et al., 2011). On the other hand, and contrary \n\nto 99% of all the plant species, halophytic vegetation species can not only survive but be highly \n\nproductive in saline environments. Halophytes are, by definition, plants that can live normally and \n\ncomplete their life cycle under a salt concentration of at least 200 mM, with most plants experiencing \n\ntolerance to a remarkable amplitude of NaCl concentration (Flowers and Colmer, 2008). However, it is \n\nknown that different halophytes species have unlike responses to same salinity, ranging from species \n\nhaving optimal performance in salt-free environments to high NaCl concentration such as 400 mM \n\n(Flowers and Colmer, 2008; Duarte et al., 2014c). Intraspecies salt tolerance variations are relevant \n\nwhen taking into consideration the potential salinity environment modification due to climate change, \n\nthat will most likely change salt tolerant plant habitat availability and distribution, within an ecosystem. \n\nThis is evident in most halophytes populated salt marshes, where species distribution is organized and \n\nclearly observed within marsh topography and morphology, where plants are arranged according to soil \n\nelevation. Salinity tolerance is certainly related to plant zonation, salinity increases with soil elevation \n\nwhen, due to extended evaporation periods in higher elevation, however above mean high sea level \n\n(MHSL) salt concentration drops again, this time due to relative rare flooding (Adam, 2002; Ca\u00e7ador et \n\nal., 2007). Nonetheless, many studies suggest that intraspecific salt tolerance variations can occur in \n\ndifferent populations (Hester et al., 1996; Flowers 2004). When intraspecific NaCl response is taken \n\ninto consideration it may show a different response to same NaCl concentration, therefore it is important \n\nto understand coastal ecosystem modification and evolution once exposed to salinity changes. \n\nTagus estuary wetland is considered one of the more important in Europe and encompasses the \n\nmost extensive and continuous salt marsh area in Portugal, presenting a great concentration of organic \n\nmatter and biological productivity. Salt marshes located within this estuary share most of the colonized \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nhalophyte species, such as the C3 halophyte Halimione portulacoides (Chenopodiaceae) and the C4 \n\nhalophyte Spartina patens (Poaceae) and exhibit mostly similar abiotic conditions but, due to \n\nanthropogenic actions, there is also presence of significant difference in soil contaminants, notably \n\nindustrial caused heavy metals pollution (Ca\u00e7ador et al., 1996). On account of climate change, it is \n\npredicted a variation of salinity concentrations and distribution in the estuary and a saltwater movement \n\nupstream due to sea level rising (Rodrigues et al., 2016). Salinity alterations in the environment will \n\nhave a heavy impact all the Tagus estuary wetlands ecosystems certainly upsetting the development and \n\ndistribution of the plant populations.  \n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the influence of heavy metal pre-conditioning in the \n\nphysiological responses of two halophyte species to different saline environments. By means of \n\nimposing salinity treatments on two different heavy metal pre-conditioned populations of two widely \n\nspread halophyte species, it was possible to evaluate significant intraspecific variability in the \n\nphysiological salt tolerance mechanisms. In view of the on-going climate change, it is relevant the \n\nknowledge of the differently conditioned salt marshes species potential to adapt and respond, directly \n\nrelated to future salt-induced habitat modifications, with respect to plant distribution and frequency. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n \n\nStudy Area and Sampling \n\n \n\nThis study sampling was carried out as described in Chapter 2, section 2.1, and the samples used for \n\nsalinity treatment were from the same group of samples gathered and grown for warming treatments \n\nexplain in the second Chapter. \n\n \n\n \n\nExperimental setup \n\n \n\nIn the lab, H. portulacoides and S. patens samples collected in Alcochete and Ros\u00e1rio salt marshes, \n\nafter four-month adaptation and growth period, were separated into 3 groups with 5 replicates each \n\n(Table 3.1) and subjected to different salt concentration. The sample groups were placed in a fitoclimatic \n\nchamber programmed to simulate a natural light environment using a sin function (maximum PAR 300 \n\n\u00b5mol photons m2 s-1, 16/8 h day/night rhythm, 20/18 \u00baC day/night temperature amplitude) and the \n\nhoagland nutrient solution was replaced, in two sample groups, with two salinity treatment solution of \n\n\u00bc Hoagland solution supplemented with NaCl in order to attain the desired salinities (400 and 800 mM). \n\nTo detect salinity stress signs, the salinity treatment had a duration of 7 days after which the plants were \n\nharvested. All leave samples for biochemical measurements were immediately flash-frozen in liquid-N2 \n\nand stored at -80\u00baC until analysis. Leaf samples harvested for fatty acid analysis were weighed before \n\nfrozen. \n\n \n\nTable 3.2- Salinity stress experimental design. \n\nSalinity Stress \n\n0 mM NaCl 400 mM NaCl 800 mM NaCl \n\nNon-\n\ncontaminated \n\n(Alcochete) \n\nContaminated \n\n(Ros\u00e1rio) \n\nNon-\n\ncontaminated \n\n(Alcochete) \n\nContaminated \n\n(Ros\u00e1rio) \n\nNon-\n\ncontaminated \n\n(Alcochete) \n\nContaminated \n\n(Ros\u00e1rio) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\nC3 (H. \n\nportulacoides) \n\nC4 (S. \n\npatens) \n\n \n\n \n\nPulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry \n\n \n\nAll measurements were made according to the manufacturer instructions and as described in Chapter \n\n1 and in previous studies (Duarte et al. 2014a), Section 2.3, allowing to attain the variables described in \n\nChapter 2, the table 2.3.1. \n\n \n\nPigment profiling \n\n \n\nPigment quantifications were made using UV-Vis spectrophotometry and a mathematical algorithm \n\ndesigned for the effect, according to Kupper et al.

On the other hand, the individuals exposed to 800 \n\nmM NaCl showed a non-significant increase of the oxidized quinone pool size (Fig. 10).

While no substantial changes in chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b) and total \n\nchlorophyll (Total Chl) concentrations were found in non-contaminated site population, in contaminated \n\nmarsh H. portulacoides it was shown a highly significant tendency of reduction of these pigments \n\nthrough salinity treatments (Fig. 11). Regarding individual carotenoid concentrations, the same response \n\nto NaCl exposure was found, with the exception of zeaxanthin. On the other hand, it was found some \n\ndifferences in pigment concentration between population samples, with the contaminated site population \n\npresenting, in general rule, higher carotenoid concentration (Fig. 11). Similar highly significant \n\nconcentration increase tendency was displayed in antheraxanthin, ?-carotene and lutein. Pigment \n\nconcentration of auroxanthin of the individuals from the two sites, exhibited a significant increase in \n\nboth high salinity treatments. Neoxanthin and violaxanthin, in both the salt marsh individuals, displayed \n\nan increase and a decrease in the 400 mM and 800 mM NaCl treatments, respectively. In H. \n\nportulacoides from the non-contaminated location, 400 mM NaCl exposure leaded to a decrease in \n\nzeaxanthin content, although in the heavy metal contaminated site samples it was observed a highly \n\nsignificant decrease in both NaCl treatments. All NaCl exposed sample groups showed an increase in \n\nchlorophyll a/b ratio (Fig. 12), significant in non-contaminated site samples. Total carotenoid to total \n\nchlorophyll ratio (Fig. 12) showed an increasing trend in all treatments, with a significant increase at \n\n400 mM NaCl and a highly significant increase at 800 mM NaCl. A similar trend was observed in \n\nchlorophyll degradation index, with a significant rise in 400 mM NaCl contaminated site samples and \n\nhighly significant increase in both populations 800 mM NaCl treatments. This increase in the \n\nchlorophyll degradation index in 400 mM NaCl exposed samples from the non-contaminated location \n\nwas not significant, possibly due to the 0 mM NaCl values differences between populations.

When compared to the individuals at 0 mM, the \n\nsalinity stressed leaves showed an increase in palmitic acid in the individuals originated from the non-\n\ncontaminated marsh, highly significant at 800mM NaCl. However, pre-conditioned plants revealed a \n\ndecrease in this fatty acid content.

This \n\nenvironmental abiotic alteration has consequences in the salinity gradient, with recent studies \n\nforecasting disturbing impacts of salinity disturbance in waterfront areas (Wheeler, 2011; Dasgupta et \n\nal., 2015). Thus, halophyte plant colonization will be of foremost importance to future environmental \n\nchange. \n\nPhotochemical analysis of the Halimione portulacoides and Spartina patens samples exposed \n\nto salt treatments confirmed that these species have a high degree of tolerance to salinity even at high \n\nNaCl concentrations. Nevertheless, it was shown an apparent variation of the consequences and \n\nresponses to different NaCl concentrations between individuals from different populations. Examining \n\nthe PS II light harvesting mechanism in H. portulacoides and S. patens it is evident the that both \n\nhalophyte species are well adapted to salt environments. Halimione portulacoides at 400 mM NaCl \n\nshowed an increase in the photosynthetic efficiency (?) when compared to the individuals at 0 mM \n\nNaCl. This data is in accordance with other studies (e.g. Duarte et al., 2014) that reveal the better \n\nperformance of H. portulacoides at approximately these salt concentrations. However, the \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency presented a significant increase in the individuals from the non-contaminated \n\nmarsh and coupled with the significant raise of the maximum ETR seen in the same sample group \n\nsuggests a better overall light harvesting efficiency to 400 mM NaCl enrich environments than the \n\nindividuals from the heavy metal contaminated marsh. Additionally, the comparatively low value of \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency found in the 0 mM NaCl treated pre-conditioned samples may suggest that \n\nnon-contaminated site H. portulacoides have better fitness under brackish conditions as well. Even \n\nthough it can be considered that H. portulacoides is an obligatory halophyte, negative impacts, due to \n\nsalinity stress, were found in the decrease of the active OECs and the increase of the K-step amplitude \n\nin the 400 mM salt treatment samples, the relationship of this parameters indicates a specific damage to \n\nthe oxygen evolving complex of PS II donor side (Duarte et al., 2016b). Considering the Kautsky curves, \n\nsalinity stress harmful consequences are also shown by the fluorescence decrease tendency throughout \n\nthe increasing salt concentration treatments, directly related to the decrease tendency detected in the \n\noxidized quinone pool size, when related with the PS II acceptor side (Strasser et al., 1995). \n\nAdditionally, it was observed variations between the curves displayed by the different H. portulacoides \n\npopulation samples within same salt treatment, O-J step of the non-contaminated site samples indicate \n\na greater damage to the photochemical energy production in the chloroplasts from both salinity \n\ntreatments, on the other hand pre-conditioned individuals at 400 mM NaCl showed a lesser efficiency \n\nin the dissipation of the excessive energy throughout thermal dissipation than its counterpart, as shown \n\nin the J-I-P step, this can have photo-inhibition consequences in the individuals from the heavy metal \n\ncontaminated marsh due to the fact that this characterizes an important ROS reducing mechanism \n\n(Duarte et al. 2014c). This assessment is confirmed in the analyzed phenomological energetic parameter, \n\nwhere a decrease tendency of the trapped energy flux (TR/CS), the electron transport energy flux \n\n(ET/CS) and the number of available reaction centers for reduction (RC/CS) was present throughout the \n\nsalinities treatments with more intensity and with bigger significance in non-contaminated site samples. \n\nAlthough the quinone poll available for reduction was diminished, the RC turnover rate increase \n\nespecially in pre-conditioned H. portulacoides individuals exposed to higher salinities, indicating lower \n\nquinone reduction rates (Duarte et al., 2016b). Pre-conditioned individuals presented an increase in net \n\nrate of PS II reactive centres as a counteractive measure, allowing higher energy fluxes than the non-\n\npre-conditioned individuals as previously seen (Panda et al., 2006; Kalaji et al., 2011). The PS I ?R0 \n\npresented a significantly improved activity through the salt stressed individuals from the contaminated \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nmarsh, indicating a tolerance mechanism to prevent accumulation of reduction power at the PS I acceptor \n\nside, in order to maintain the redox equilibrium between photosystems (Kr\u00fcger et al., 2014; Duarte et \n\nal., 2016b), on the other hand this mechanism has not present in the non-pre-conditioned samples. \n\nNevertheless, when compared to the individuals from the non-contaminated marsh the pre-conditioned \n\nH. portulacoides displayed greater signs of PS II antennae connectivity disruption, as shown by PG, \n\nespecially when exposed to 800 mM NaCl, impairing the energetic transport (Strasser and Strirbet, \n\n2001). The loss of connectivity between PS II antennae can be a major reason for the comparatively \n\nlower photosynthetic efficiency and J-I-P step observed in the pre-conditioned individuals at 400 mM \n\nNaCl, as a result of the inhibition of the ETC (Zushi et al., 2012). According to the PAM fluorometry \n\ndata, it can be argued that the H. portulacoides from the non-contaminated location had a better \n\nperformance when exposed to 400 mM NaCl conditions, on the other hand, at 800 mM NaCl, the heavy \n\nmetal pre-contained individuals presented a slightly better biophysical feedback. \n\n Considering the electron transport chain and related parameters in salt treated S. patens, when \n\ncompared to 0 mM NaCl, it was observed a significant raise in overall photosynthetic light efficiency in \n\npre-conditioned individuals at 400mM NaCl as well as significant decrease in maximum ETR at 400mM \n\nand 800mM NaCl in non-contaminated and contaminated site samples respectively. This may suggest a \n\nworse electron transport chain proficiency in S. patens from the heavy metal contaminated location when \n\nexpose to 800mM NaCl concentrations, in contrast to a better performance in S. patens from the non-\n\ncontaminated site when exposed to that same high salinity. The pre-contaminated individuals that \n\nshowed an increase in the photosynthetic efficiency at 400 mM NaCl also displayed a relatively low \n\ndissipation energy, suggesting a higher efficiency in the electronic transport chain. Observing the \n\nKautsky curves in S. patens, exposure to salinity clearly affected the fluorescence values, presenting, in \n\nindividuals subjected to high salinities, a depressed and homogenous profile with less distinguishable \n\npeaks, characteristic of stressed plants. Nevertheless, the active OECs and the K-step amplitude \n\nremained the same, with no significant changes, within marsh sample groups, yet the relationship \n\nbetween this Kautsky curve derived parameters, when comparing the non-pre-conditioned and pre-\n\nconditioned salinity treated samples, can indicate a better PS II function in the heavy metal pre-\n\nconditioned S. patens. The loss of the area above the transient curve is directly associated to the size of \n\nthe oxidized quinone pool (Strasser et al., 1995), that in turn will greatly influence the phenomological \n\nenergetic parameters (Kalaji et al., 2011). According to the data acquired, in the salt exposed samples \n\ngroups, there is a linear relationship between the variation found in the oxidized quinone pool size the \n\nelectron transport energy flux, the absorbed energy flux (ABS/CS), the trapped energy flux, as well as \n\nthe available reaction centers, nonetheless, the population showed differences in significance among \n\nthese values. Even though the pre-conditioned S. patens at 400 and 800 mM NaCl, when compared to \n\nthe samples at 0 mM NaCl, showed a more significant decrease in quinone pool size, yet the reduction \n\nin the electron transport energy flux was less significant than the one displayed in the individuals from \n\nthe non-contaminated site, this can be explain by the better PS II efficiency associated with the lower \n\ndissipation energy flux found in the pre-conditioned individuals (Kalaji et al., 2011). Although the \n\nquinone pool size, in the individuals from the non-contaminated location subjected to salinity stress, \n\ndisplayed no significant changes in the number of quinones, the number of quinone turnovers increased, \n\nshowing lower quinone pool reduction rates (Duarte et al., 2016b), in contrast the individuals from the \n\ncontaminated marsh exhibited a significant reduction of the quinone pool size and no significant changes \n\nin its turnover time, indicating tolerance mechanisms that allowed the maintenance of electronic flow \n\nrate from the reduced quinone pool to the electron transport chain ( Duarte et al., 2014c).  \n\nXanthophyll cycle is a well-described mechanism of energy dissipation, commonly observed in \n\nhalophytic plants (Duarte et al, 2013a, 2014a, 2014b, 2016b). To reduce energy overload within light-\n\nharvesting complexes (LHCs), the de-epoxidation of the violaxanthin pool towards the zeaxanthin is \n\nnormally activated (Wentworth et al., 2000). Both H. portulacoides populations shown the presence of \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\nxanthophyll cycle, demonstrated by the highly significant raises in de-epoxidation when salt treated in \n\ncomparison to the samples at 0 mM NaCl. Halimione portulacoides also showed increase tendency in \n\nthe total carotenoid to total chlorophyll ratio, indicating a plant activity shift from light harvesting to \n\nphotoprotection (Wentworth et al., 2000). Both high salinity treated samples from both location shown \n\na significant increase in auroxanthin, an analog of violaxanthin, a C5,8 carotenoid with an aggregation \n\n-associated querying capacity (Ruban et al., 1998), when compared to the 0 mM NaCl treated groups. \n\nThis pigment energy dissipation capacity relies on the fact that the auroxanthin first energy stage is \n\nhigher than that of the violaxanthin (Wentworth et al., 2000), an efficient energy quencher when the \n\nplant is stressed (Ruban et al., 1998). Nonetheless, H. portulacoides from the non-contaminated site \n\npresents a higher significance in the increase of this pigment at 400 mM NaCl then its counterpart, \n\nsuggesting a better energy dissipation mechanism in the non-pre-conditioned samples at 400 mM NaCl, \n\ncorroborating the inferences made when observing their Kautsky curves, that suggested that heavy metal \n\npre-conditioned samples displayed a lesser energy dissipation efficiency. Moreover, chlorophyll \n\ndegradation index increased highly significantly within the high concentration salt treatments except in \n\nthe non-pre-condition individual at 400 mM NaCl, pointing to a better light harvesting stress response. \n\nConsidering S. patens exposed to salinity, only in 800 mM NaCl treatments in both population samples, \n\nshowed a highly significant increase in de-epoxidation, reflection of a higher activity of the xanthophyll \n\ncycle attempting to scatter the excessive redox potential amassed inside the stroma. The activity shift to \n\nphotoprotection in the higher salinities was also clear due to the significant rise of total carotenoid to \n\ntotal chlorophyll ratio. As a possible countermeasure against reactive oxygen species (ROS; Duarte et \n\nal., 2013a) highly significant rises were observed in ?-carotene and lutein, anti-oxidant acting, pigment \n\nconcentrations in both H. portulacoides salt exposed populations. In S. patens, this countermeasure was \n\nfound more significant in the population from the non-contaminated marsh, as a highly significant \n\nincrease in ?-carotene was found in the contaminated site samples at 800mM NaCl and at both high \n\nsalinity concentration in the plants from the non-contaminated location, as well as a highly significant \n\nincrease in lutein at 800 mM NaCl. This may indicate a better ROS savaging response by pre-\n\nconditioned S. patens. \n\nThe interaction of high NaCl concentrations with the cell organelles leads to an increase \n\nproduction ROS resulting in potentially harmful physiological reactions within the plant cells, affecting \n\namong others, proteins production and metabolism (Duarte et al., 2013b). Halophytes built up a highly \n\nproficient system of enzymatic rapid responses toward salinity changes, immediately activated when the \n\nenvironmental conditions shift aside from the saline comfort zone (Zhou et al., 2014). When observing \n\nthe salt treated H. portulacoides populations, it showed similar responses in the second line of ROS \n\ndefense between them, displaying comparable value changes in the peroxidase-class enzymes, such as, \n\ncatalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPx), and ascorbate peroxidase, that are fundamental for the \n\ndetoxification of the hydrogen peroxide and key in the reduction of ROS to non-damaging \n\nconcentrations (Duarte et al., 2014c). However, at the first line of defense, superoxide dismutase (SOD), \n\nwhich catalyzes the conversion of the highly toxic superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide (Duarte et \n\nal., 2014c), exhibited a highly significant increase in in the 800 mM NaCl treated individuals from the \n\nnon-contaminated marsh. This coupled with the highly significant decrease of the total protein content \n\nfound in this same group, subjects that, when exposed to 800 mM NaCl, the non-preconditioned H. \n\nportulacoides had a higher ROS production than the pre-conditioned H. portulacoides, indicating lower \n\nresistance to high Na+ interaction. Scavenging mechanisms of ROS species were highly efficient at 400 \n\nmM NaCl due to the lowering of the lipid peroxidation levels in comparison to the individuals at 0 mM \n\nNaCl, this was acquired from the analysis of the leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, a direct \n\nproduct oxidative degradation of membrane lipids (Neto et al., 2005), this indicates and is in accordance \n\nwith the knowledge that H. portulacoides is better adapted to a 400mM NaCl setting than no salt \n\nenvironment. However, the MDA decrease present in both 400mM NaCl treatments was more \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\nsignificant in the non-contaminated site individuals and consequently can be considered healthier and \n\nmore salt tolerant in comparison to their H. portulacoides counterpart, possibly due to the better energy \n\ndissipation mechanism seen previously in the plants from the non-contaminated marsh. When \n\ncomparing the oxidative stress biomarkers in S. patens, variances between populations are clear. \n\nContrary to what was found in the pre-conditioned S. patens, the non-contaminated site individuals \n\ndisplayed an increase of superoxide dismutase and a decrease in total protein content through NaCl \n\ntreatments, suggesting an inferior scavenging mechanism of the ROS species. This is especially felt in \n\nthe non-pre-conditioned S. patens at 800 mM NaCl due to higher lipid peroxidation levels, seen thru the \n\nhighly significant increase of the MDA concentration. \n\nThe fatty acid profiles of the salt exposed halophytes presented similar responses amongst \n\npopulations, but some differences were found. The linoleic (C18:2) and linolenic (C18:3) ratios can be \n\na salt stress indication, when under stress condition the ratio shifts towards linolenic, since it is a \n\nmembrane restructuring with lower amounts of polyunsaturated acids, thus inferior C18:3 concentration \n\nin the leaf is considered an adaptation to salt exposure (Hamed et al. 2005). The C18:2/ C18:3 ratio \n\nincreased exclusively through the NaCl treatments in the heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens, \n\ntherefore tis can suggest that these individuals are less salinity stressed than those from the non-\n\ncontaminated location. Furthermore, C18:3 can also act as a direct non-enzymatic reactive oxygen \n\nspecies (ROS) scavenger (Mene-Saffrane et al. 2009), which complies with the, comparatively, lower \n\nROS consequences found previously in the pre-conditioned S. patens. Furthermore, pre-conditioned S. \n\npatens displayed highly significant rise in oleic acid (C18:1), known for improving the stabilization of \n\nlight-harvesting complexes (Siefermann-Harms and Angerhofer, 1998), as seen by the positive \n\nsignificant correlation between LHC stress indictor chl a/ chl b ration and the C18:1 fatty acid significant \n\ncorrelation (r2 = 0,921; P<0,05), on the other hand in the individuals from the non-contaminated site the \n\ncorrelation between this two variables is quite low (r2 = 0,161; P<0,05), indicating that this mechanism \n\nonly occur in the plants from the heavy metal contaminated marsh. Regarding the palmitic acid (C16:0), \n\nthat plays a vital role in the PS II functioning (Duarte et al., 2016b), in H. portulacoides the highly \n\nsignificant increases, when compared to individuals at 0 mM NaCl, where found in the non-pre-\n\nconditioned individuals at 400 mM NaCl and in pre-conditioned individuals at 800 mM NaCl, indicating \n\na better PS II functioning in these sample groups than their counterparts, supporting the inferences made \n\nwhen analyzing the H. portulacoides PAM fluorometry data. Tras-delta-3 hexadecenoic acid (C16:1t), \n\nexclusive to plastids (Tr\u00e9moli\u00e8res and Siegenthaler, 1983) and the only strictly light dependent fatty \n\nacid, enables the correct organization of light-harvesting antennae complexes (Nussberger et al., 1993; \n\nHobe et al., 1994; \u201a Hobe et al., 1995; Duarte et al., 2016). In S. patens, when compared to the \n\nindividuals at 0 mM NaCl, a significant increasing trend was found in the C16:1t concentration of the \n\nindividuals from the contaminated marsh, concomitant with the, previously determined, lower energy \n\ndissipation and reduced reaction centres turnover and closure rates found in the pre-conditioned samples, \n\ncomparatively to those found in the individuals from the non-contaminated marsh, proposing a better \n\nLHC organization and heath in the heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens when exposed to salt stress. \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nConclusions  \n \n\nThe invasion of exotic species to new environments are regulated by numerous abiotic \n\nrestrictions (Daehler and Strong, 1996), the same is applied to the distribution and survival of the native \n\nspecies when the forecasted climate change phenomenon alters the ecosystem abiotic settings. Salt \n\nmarshes ecosystems are characterized for being high salinity ecosystems, where only halophytes, salt \n\ntolerant plants are able to endure, on the other hand, species have different salinity tolerances, \n\nconsequently salinity concentration is one of the major constraints of species frequency, distribution and \n\nzonation (Silvestri et al., 2004; Duarte et al., 2014c).  \n\nThis study showed that both C3 Halimione portulacoides and the invasive C4 Spartina patens \n\nare extremely tolerant to high concentration salinity changes, even being able to adapt to an environment \n\nroughly twice as saline as the ocean. Nonetheless, our findings showed that environmental heavy metal \n\npre-conditioning have a considerable influence on the salinity tolerance mechanisms and salinity \n\nresistance of these plants. The halophyte species displayed noteworthy intraspecific biophysical and \n\nbiochemical variations when exposed to salty stress, due to the significantly different pre-conditioning \n\nhistory between populations. According to the data gathered and in agreement to previous studies, H. \n\nportulacoides exposed to 400 mM NaCl appear to have a better photosynthetic efficiency, however, \n\neven though H. portulacoides from the contaminated marsh displayed better photochemical energy \n\nproduction, as seen in the O-J step and the energy fluxes, the non-pre-conditioned plants at 400 mM \n\nNaCl displayed an overall better performance at this salinity mostly due to a better ability to dissipate \n\nenergy seen in the J-I-P step, this is supported by the reduced ROS damage and the better energy \n\ndissipation mechanism, apparent in the more significant auroxanthin increase that suggests a more \n\nefficient energy dissipation mechanism. On the other hand, 800 mM NaCl treated H. portulacoides from \n\nthe non-contaminated location exhibited an overall inferior response to this high salinity concentration. \n\nHeavy metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides at 800 mM NaCl showed an seemingly more efficient \n\nsalt tolerance, demonstrated in the lesser damages in photochemical energy production, showing a \n\ncomparatively better photon entrapment and energy transferred in the transport chain, clearly seen in the \n\nvariances between the phenomological energetic parameters of both populations as well as increasing \n\nin palmitic acid that acted as a countermeasure to the salinity stress, ensuring the PS II functioning. \n\nRegarding the variances found in the stress responses in the salinity exposed S. patens populations, it \n\nwas apparent that the heavy metal contaminated marsh population exhibited lesser damages due to \n\ncomparatively more efficient salt tolerance mechanisms. Pre-conditioned individuals appear to have \n\nsignificantly more effective biochemical responses that the individuals from the non-contaminated site, \n\nthat appear to withstand harshest photochemical consequences as seen by the decrease throughout higher \n\nsalt concentrations of the chlorophyll a/b ratio, contrarily to the increase tendency found in the pre-\n\nconditioned. This correlating with the highly significant increase in oleic acid found only in pre-\n\nconditioned S. patens, indicates that the plants from this population have an effective light-harvesting \n\ncomplexes stabilization mechanism, on the other hand, non-pre-conditioned appear to display \n\nimpairments in the LHC mechanisms, that coupled with the comparatively deficient energy dissipation \n\nmechanisms, seems to lead to higher ROS generation and as consequence greater plant damage.  \n\nRendering the latest IPCC report, the variation in salinity concentration will intensify and will \n\nhave highly detrimental consequences on the world\u2019s coastal ecosystems. In Tagus estuary is predicted \n\na meaningful change in the salinity concentrations and distribution upstream due to sea level rising \n\n(Rodrigues et al., 2016). As environmental salinity is one of the major constraints to the distribution and \n\ncolonization of plant species along salt marsh (Duarte et al, 2014c), climate change will directly affect \n\nthe valuable salt marsh ecosystem and their communities. However, complexes and significant \n\ninterspecific variations in the biophysical and biochemical responses to salt stress were observed in the \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nstudied halophytes, due to their different pre-conditioned histories. This will potentially shape the future \n\nsalt marsh communities. Our findings suggest heavy metal pre-conditioning do not have a linear \n\ninfluence throughout higher salt concentrations. Halimione portulacoides had a relatively worse \n\nperformance when heavy metal pre-conditioned at 400 mM NaCl, on the other hand at 800 mM NaCl \n\nhad a better performance, moreover S. patens displayed a better performance when heavy metal pre-\n\nconditioned in both high salinities. Therefore, when the environmental salinity reaches 400 mM the \n\nheavy metal contaminated marsh may experience a more aggressive S. patens invasion and spreading \n\nthan in the non-contaminated marsh, possibly signifying more negative ecological impacts in the \n\ncontaminated salt marsh biodiversity. Nonetheless, at very high salinities such as 800 mM, both H. \n\nportulacoides and S. patens from the heavy metal salt marsh appear to have a higher fitness and salt \n\ntolerance than those form the non-contaminated marsh, meaning that it may be more resistant to nearly \n\ndeathly salt concentrations, potentially able to survive salinities that the other marsh community could \n\nnot. \n\nThus, heavy metal pre-conditioning could potentially be a key factor to understand the species \n\nadaptation to the climate change reality, subsequently, halophyte species intraspecific salt tolerance \n\nvariances due to abiotic pre-conditioning are essential when considering climate change scenarios.   \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nReferences \n \n\nAdam, P., 2002.

However, despite humanity intrinsically rely on the \n\nbenefits provided by wetlands, according to the 2017 Ramsar Policy Brief 1, more than half of the \n\nworld\u2019s wetlands have been lost in the past one hundred years due to anthropogenic actions. \n\nFurthermore, this loss and ecosystem degradation continues at an alarming rate around the world, \n\ncontributing to lower resilience to disasters and climate change. Salt marshes are coastal wetlands, \n\nlocated in low hydrodynamism estuarine areas. These ecosystems have evolved to endure harsh \n\nenvironmental conditions and fluctuations and, as stated before, are provides of a wide range of unique \n\nservices such as coastal protection, water purification and retention, nutrient transformation, sediment \n\nstabilization, shelter for migratory birds, fish and shellfish nurseries, among others (Teixeira et al., 2014; \n\nDuarte et al., 2017). Salt marshes, due to the many abiotic and anthropogenic pressures and stressors \n\nthat they are typically subjected, are characteristically colonized by the very resilient halophyte \n\nvegetation. Although halophytes plants can survive and even thrive in exceptionally stressful \n\nenvironments (Duarte et al., 2013a; 2013b; 2014; 2015), human impacts coupled with climate change \n\nwill have profound consequences in coastal salt marshes (Simas et al., 2001; Lotze et al., 2006). Hence, \n\nthe preservation of these unique ecotone is vital, and it has become a conservation priority in most \n\ncounties. In order to predict the ongoing climate change impacts in the marsh ecosystem and its \n\ncommunity a systematic understanding of physiological mechanisms underlying marsh vegetation \n\nresistance mechanisms might not be enough, considering that intraspecific variation as a significant \n\nexpression within wide-raging and highly tolerant species, due to specific environmental pre-\n\nconditioning exposure. Thereby commonly occurring halophyte species may maintain, within different \n\npopulations, a variety of physiology, morphology, and phenology local specializations that will be have \n\nan influence in their feedback to future environmental stresses (Valladares et al., 2007). Moreover, \n\nnowadays, the potential to significant intraspecific variation between neighbor populations is more \n\nevident than ever, on account of human impact on a specific location and ecosystem, as shown \n\npreviously in the heavy metal contamination of the Ros\u00e1rio salt marsh due to industrial activities (Duarte \n\net al., 2013b). In the face of climate change, these issues are of utmost importance and in order to \n\nunderstand and protect this ecosystem, reinforcing the need to study the causal-effect relationship and \n\nvariabilities between environmental changes and ecosystem changes. \n\nThis study covered two wide-ranging halophyte species, a native C3 and an invasive C4, from \n\ntwo different salt marshes within Tagus Estuary, in which one, the soil, is heavy metal contaminated, in \n\norder to allow the understanding of a heavy metal cross-tolerance to various induced abiotic stresses. \n\nAccording to the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, all scenarios predict a rise in the surface \n\ntemperature over this century, as well as a very likely increase in the frequency and duration of heat \n\nwave, with great significance in the Tagus Estuary region (Guerreiro et al., 2018), inevitably affecting \n\nthe marsh plant communities. Although negative stress signs were exhibited, both halophyte species \n\npresented highly efficient tolerance mechanisms to heat stress, nevertheless it was evident an \n\nintraspecific variation in the biophysiological and biochemical responses between both the C3 H. \n\nportulacoides and C4 S. patens populations. Our data suggests that, when exposed to warming treatment, \n\nH. portulacoides from the heavy metal contaminated location had a more efficient tolerance mechanism \n\nand a higher resistance to warming stress when compared to plants from the non-contaminated site. This \n\nwas clearly displayed through the more efficient photobiological light harvesting processes found in the \n\npre-conditioned H. portulacoides, as well as the lower photoprotection observed in the non-pre-\n\nconditioned H. portulacoides. On the other hand, in S. patens, the population from the non-contaminated \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n\n \n\nmarsh appear to exhibit less damage than the population from the contaminated marsh, evident by the \n\nphoto-oxidative stress vulnerability experienced by pre-conditioned S. patens. Thus, cross-tolerance \n\nresults indicate that pre-conditioned H. portulacoides and non-pre-conditioned S. patens are better suited \n\nto endure upcoming warming events than their counterparts. From this it seems reasonable to assume \n\nthat in heavy metal contaminated marsh, the non-indigenous S. patens will suffer more severe \n\nconsequences, while on the other hand H. portulacoides will display better performance under the same \n\nheat conditions, which can dissuade the invasion trend showed by the S. patens in Tagus marshes, \n\nfavoring the indigenous community. Oppositely in non-contaminated marshes environmental changes \n\nwill make these ecosystems prone to the invasion by this exotic species. Therefore, it can be concluded \n\nthat the upcoming warming events boosted by climate change, will have a more serious and immediate \n\necological consequences in marsh from the non-contaminated location due to the relative enabling of \n\nthe colonization by invasive species in the non-contaminated location, changing the marsh landscape in \n\na different and possibly more negative manner, than in the heavy metal contaminated marsh. \n\nClimate change research also foresees the likely increase of the ongoing word-wide land \n\nsalinization phenomenon (IPCC, 2014). Coastal regions, especially in estuaries, will experience a soil \n\nand water salinity increase at an elevated rate, due to sea level rise, storm and tidal surges coupled with \n\nincreases in air temperature (Dasgupta and Hossain et al., 2015). Moreover, it is expected that Tagus \n\nestuary will significantly change in salinity concentrations and distribution (Rodrigues et al., 2016). This \n\nphenomenon will bring profound consequences to the halophyte marsh communities, since salinity \n\nconcentration is one of the major constraints to species frequency, distribution and zonation in salt \n\nmarshes (Silvestri et al., 2004; Duarte et al, 2014b). To understand the pre-conditioning implications in \n\nthe salt tolerance mechanisms of this plants and their variability, biophysical and biochemical responses \n\nto this potential stressor were uncovered. Our study showed a complex and significant intraspecific \n\nvariations in the H. portulacoides and S. patens salt stress responses due to their pre-conditioned \n\nhistories, our results suggest that heavy metal pre-conditioning does not have a straightforward influence \n\nin the salinity tolerance mechanisms. Heavy metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides, when compared to \n\ntheir counterpart, presented a more deficient photochemical energy production and overall worse \n\nperformance when exposed to mild salinity, while under elevated exposure exhibited a better efficiency \n\nin salt tolerance mechanisms. Nonetheless, heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens shown a higher fitness \n\nthroughout increasing salt concentrations, displaying more effective LHC and dissipation mechanisms \n\nthan non-pre-conditioned individuals. Therefore, it can be argued that under mild salinities the \n\ncontaminated marsh may experience more severe ecological consequences, as result of the contrastingly \n\npoorer performance from this H. portulacoides population, allowing an accelerated spreading of \n\ninvasive species, with impacts in the salt marsh biodiversity and organization. Nevertheless, elevated \n\nsalinities, both C3 and C4 heavy metal pre-conditioned marsh plants populations exhibit better fitness \n\nthan their counterparts, revealing that in this salt marsh there is a potentially higher salinity resistance, \n\nfavoring contaminated marsh growing and survival, according to imminent climate change \n\nconsequences. \n\nThrough this work it is possible to conclude that salt marsh halophyte species tolerance and \n\nresilience to new abiotic factors is meaningfully influenced by their pre-conditioning history. This \n\nreinforces the fact that plants, with a large abiotic tolerance spectrum, have an active physiological \n\nplasticity according to their environmental specificity. This represents a tailored adaptation to the \n\nstresses present in their specific habitat, as a result of cross-tolerance, that will have significant effects \n\nin how plants\u2019 mechanisms will act and respond to upcoming abiotic stresses, thus determining plant \n\ngrowth and development. It is clear that halophytes\u2019 adaptation to the local conditions or pre-\n\nconditioning will indirectly influence, the way the population will react to climate changes, thereby, \n\ninfluencing the salt marsh vegetation community and their ecosystem. Thus, it is far evident that \n\nhalotolerance and thermotolerance of the previously studied plants that are clearly interconnected with \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\ntheir pre-conditioning, presenting an intraspecific physiological variation with ecological sway, in how \n\ntwo neighboring salt marshes will evolve. Consequently, this key factor needs to be taken in to account \n\nwhen modeling and predicting climate change scenarios on individual salt marshes. The first steps in \n\nunderstanding pre-conditioning influence was taken by researching metal induced cross-tolerance to \n\nthermal and saline stresses, relying on a multidisciplinary approach, considering and correlating \n\nbiochemical and biophysical responses and searching for ecology meaning. This examination took after \n\nthis premise and contributed with pertinent new information to the comprehension of ecophysiological \n\ndrivers. This can also be a tool useful to more efficiently manage appropriate conservation actions, \n\nhighlighting the services of all salt marshes in order to be able to benefit from their unique and valuable \n\nresources in the future. Additionally, among these strategies, the heterogeneity between salt marsh \n\nhabitats should also be protected to maintain intraspecific variability safeguarding a variety of \n\nphysiological specializations that will, in some instances, result in an advantageous cross-tolerance. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n\n \n\nReferences \n \n\nDasgupta, S., Hossain, M., Huq, M., Wheeler, D., 2015.
