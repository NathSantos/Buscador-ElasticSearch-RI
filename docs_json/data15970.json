A introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o-ind\u00edgenas come\u00e7ou a ser comum no in\u00edcio do s\u00e9culo XX \n\ndevido ao grande aumento do tr\u00e1fego mar\u00edtimo decorrente da globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Regra-geral, a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde novas esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o \u00e9 propositada. Grande parte dos indiv\u00edduos pioneiros s\u00e3o transportados em \u00e1guas \n\nde lastro ou viajam encrustados em navios transoce\u00e2nicos. Os indiv\u00edduos transportados para fora da sua \n\nzona original de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o podem assumir um estatuto de esp\u00e9cie invasora se detiverem determinadas \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas: elevada resili\u00eancia a mudan\u00e7as ambientais, grandes taxas de recrutamento e crescimento, \n\ngrande variabilidade gen\u00e9tica, curto per\u00edodo de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o, maturidade sexual precoce, grande capacidade \n\nreprodutiva e/ou uma dieta muito diversificada.  \n\nA costa sudeste do Brasil, onde este estudo foi desenvolvido, n\u00e3o apresenta forma\u00e7\u00f5es recifais de \n\ncoral, contudo existem algumas esp\u00e9cies de coral na regi\u00e3o, como \u00e9 o caso do coral c\u00e9rebro end\u00e9mico \n\nMussismilia hispida e do coral invasor Tubastraea spp.  \n\nEste trabalho tem como principal objetivo perceber de que forma o coral invasor, Tubastraea spp., \n\ninfluencia a estrutura da comunidade local e o seu impacto na teia tr\u00f3fica. Para tal, foram desenvolvidos \n\ndois estudos em paralelo, no ver\u00e3o de 2017. O primeiro visa compreender como a presen\u00e7a de coral-sol \n\ninfluencia a macrofauna associada ao substrato rochoso, tendo em conta tr\u00eas coberturas de coral \n\ndiferentes (0%, 50%, 100%), em dois locais distintos na Ilha de B\u00fazios, SP, Brasil (cap\u00edtulo 2). Enquanto \n\nque o segundo trabalho pretende caracterizar a teia tr\u00f3fica facilitada pelo coral-sol e elucidar se o bivalve \n\ninvasor Leiosolenus aristatus recebe alimento do seu anfitri\u00e3o, Tubastraea spp (cap\u00edtulo 3). Ambos os \n\nestudos focam quest\u00f5es em aberto sobre o efeito do coral-sol como engenheiro ecossist\u00e9mico na regi\u00e3o. \n\nO g\u00e9nero Tubastraea refere-se a um coral ahermat\u00edpico e azooxantelado, pertencente \u00e0 ordem \n\nScleractinia. \u00c9 o \u00fanico g\u00e9nero de escleract\u00edneos a invadir o Brasil atualmente, tendo uma alta taxa de \n\ninvas\u00e3o que o torna numa das maiores amea\u00e7as \u00e0 biodiversidade marinha local. Coral-sol \u00e9 a designa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nem portugu\u00eas, devido \u00e0 disposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus p\u00f3lipos e colora\u00e7\u00e3o amarela/alaranjada. As principais \n\nesp\u00e9cies a ocorrerem em \u00e1guas brasileiras s\u00e3o Tubastraea cocc\u00ednea e Tubastraea tagusensis. O coral-\n\nsol \u00e9 nativo do Indo-Pac\u00edfico tendo uma vasta distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica. O seu sucesso como esp\u00e9cie \n\ninvasora adv\u00e9m da posse de algumas caracter\u00edsticas, tais como o hermafroditismo, uma estrat\u00e9gia \n\nreprodutiva diversificada, uma elevada capacidade de fixa\u00e7\u00e3o em substrato natural e artificial, altas taxas \n\nde recrutamento e crescimento, e uma prefer\u00eancia de assentamento em estruturas verticais. No oceano \n\nAtl\u00e2ntico, o in\u00edcio da sua invas\u00e3o ocorreu no mar das Cara\u00edbas (anos 1940) e o primeiro registo no Brasil \n\nfoi nos anos 1980, numa plataforma petrol\u00edfera, na ba\u00eda de Campos, a norte do estado do Rio de Janeiro.  \n\nO Cap\u00edtulo 1 introduz o tema em estudo, apresentando os principais objetivos de trabalho da tese, o \n\nCap\u00edtulo 2, foca o impacto do coral-sol na fauna bent\u00f3nica, o Cap\u00edtulo 3 descreve a teia tr\u00f3fica em que \n\nse insere o coral-sol, com recurso a an\u00e1lise de is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis, e o Cap\u00edtulo 4 apresenta as conclus\u00f5es \n\ngerais e perspetivas futuras sobre este tema.   \n\nO trabalho apresentado no Cap\u00edtulo 2 contou com a recolha de amostras em dois locais distintos, \n\nseparados por 3km, ao longo da Ilha de B\u00fazios, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil, e duas \u00e1reas de amostragem em cada \n\nlocal, distanciadas por algumas dezenas de metros. O trabalho de campo consistiu na raspagem de tr\u00eas \n\nr\u00e9plicas em cada \u00e1rea, em regi\u00f5es saturadas pelo coral, parcialmente cobertas (aproximadamente 50% \n\nde cobertura) e sem presen\u00e7a do invasor. Todo o material recolhido foi lavado e peneirado em 9 crivos \n\nde malha com di\u00e2metros decrescentes, onde ficou retida a macrofauna. Ap\u00f3s separa\u00e7\u00e3o, identifica\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\narmazenamento da fauna encontrada, procedeu-se \u00e0 an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e1veis univariadas (abund\u00e2ncia, \n\nbiomassa e tamanho m\u00e9dio), \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00edndice de diversidade e riqueza Shanon-Wiener e \u00e0 an\u00e1lise \n\n\n\nIII \n\n \n\nmultivariada da estrutura da comunidade. Todas as an\u00e1lises referidas seguiram o mesmo modelo, tendo \n\n\u201ccoral cover\u201d como o principal fator (\u201cno coral, half-coral e full coral\u201d), examinados \u00e0 escala espacial \n\nde dois locais e duas \u00e1reas. O coral-sol provou ser um elemento de exclus\u00e3o de alguns macro-\n\ninvertebrados (ex. tana\u00eddeos, ostracodes e cop\u00e9podes) e o respons\u00e1vel pelo decl\u00ednio da abund\u00e2ncia e \n\nriqueza na estrutura da comunidade local. \u00c9 sugerida a exist\u00eancia de um cen\u00e1rio satisfat\u00f3rio, em termos \n\nde abund\u00e2ncia, biomassa e riqueza, em regi\u00f5es onde a presen\u00e7a do coral-sol \u00e9 parcial ou inexistente.  \n\nPerante os resultados obtidos, pode-se sugerir, tamb\u00e9m, que o limiar da resili\u00eancia do ecossistema \n\nestudado est\u00e1 iminente. Este estudo confirma o coral-sol como um importante engenheiro ecossist\u00e9mico \n\n\u2013 organismo cuja presen\u00e7a ou atividade altera as caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas circundantes, criando e \n\nmodificando habitats e influenciando todas as esp\u00e9cies a\u00ed presentes. Medidas ter\u00e3o de ser tomadas \n\nrapidamente para evitar perdas permanentes de biodiversidade local. \n\nPor outro lado, a an\u00e1lise isot\u00f3pica do ?\n13\n\nC e ?\n15\n\nN apresentada no Cap\u00edtulo 3 revelou que a teia tr\u00f3fica \n\nassociada ao coral \u00e9 maioritariamente composta por organismos filtradores e que as novas comunidades, \n\nap\u00f3s a invas\u00e3o, s\u00e3o dominadas por seres heterotr\u00f3ficos, em vez de autotr\u00f3ficos (organismos dominantes \n\nantes da invas\u00e3o). Para al\u00e9m da importante expans\u00e3o do coral-sol, o mitil\u00eddeo Leiosolenus aristatus, \n\nnativo do mar das Cara\u00edbas, mas com uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica muito alargada, foi frequentemente \n\nencontrado no interior das bases r\u00edgidas do coral invasor. Tubastraea spp. e Leiosolenus aristatus s\u00e3o \n\norigin\u00e1rios de localiza\u00e7\u00f5es geogr\u00e1ficas distintas, portanto a sua associa\u00e7\u00e3o apenas ocorre em locais onde \n\nambos s\u00e3o al\u00f3ctones. Os resultados obtidos sugerem que tanto o coral-sol, como o bivalve, s\u00e3o \n\norganismos filtradores. Uma das hip\u00f3teses para a ocorr\u00eancia desta associa\u00e7\u00e3o, seria a de que o bivalve \n\nbeneficiaria de alimento providenciado pelo coral, mas tal n\u00e3o se verificou. A invas\u00e3o do mitil\u00eddeo \u00e9 \n\nfacilitada pelo coral, por este encontrar ref\u00fagio nas suas bases calc\u00e1rias. \u00c9 expect\u00e1vel que a continua\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda invas\u00e3o pelo coral-sol seja acompanhada pela expans\u00e3o da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o deste bivalve invasor.  \n\nConclui-se que a r\u00e1pida invas\u00e3o do coral-sol no litoral norte de S\u00e3o Paulo, \u00e9 uma grave amea\u00e7a \u00e0 \n\nbiodiversidade local por estar iminente uma importante altera\u00e7\u00e3o do ecossistema, juntamente com a \n\nfacilita\u00e7\u00e3o da introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de um bivalve invasor, competidor com outras esp\u00e9cies nativas. A altera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde habitats, pode vir a ter consequ\u00eancias profundas nas comunidades locais. Ambos os estudos, s\u00e3o \n\npontos de partida para o conhecimento do impacto negativo que o coral-sol pode ter na estrutura da \n\ncomunidade associada aos fundos rochosos, como engenheiro ecossist\u00e9mico. Sugere-se a continua\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde estudos dentro desta tem\u00e1tica, com o intuito de aumentar o conhecimento, contribuindo para a \n\neventual gest\u00e3o, minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos impactos ou erradica\u00e7\u00e3o desta esp\u00e9cie invasora. \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Esp\u00e9cie invasora, Tubastraea spp., engenheiro ecossist\u00e9mico, teia tr\u00f3fica, estrutura \n\nda comunidade. \n\n  \n\n\n\nIV \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nInvasive species are a serious threat to biodiversity because they displace native species, change \n\ncommunity structure and food webs and alter fundamental processes (such as nutrient cycling and \n\nsedimentation). Any organism that is outside of its native geographic range that may or has become \n\ninjurious to animal or human health, the economy and/or natural environment is considered as invasive \n\nspecies. Globalization (i.e. increase of the international ship traffic) is the main driver of invasive species \n\nintroduction. Tubastraea spp., commonly designated sun coral, is an ahermatypic and azooxanthellate \n\nscleractinian coral, the only scleractinian which has been introduced in Brazilian waters and one of the \n\nmost widespread invaders in the world. The present work aimed to investigate the impact of Tubastraea \n\nspp. in the local biological community, examining the rocky shore associated macrofauna, in an area \n\nunder rapid invasion, at B\u00fazios Island, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, under three different coral coverages (0%, \n\n50% and 100%) (chapter 2) and characterizing the food web associated with Tubastraea spp., using \n\nstable isotopes (chapter 3), during the summer of 2017. Chapter 1 introduces the basis for this work and \n\ndescribes the main aims of this thesis. Chapter 2 investigates the impact of the sun coral on the benthic \n\nmacrofauna, chapter 3 describes the food web where this coral is included, and chapter 4 presents the \n\nmain conclusions and future perspectives. \n\nThe alteration of mobile invertebrate assemblages according to the degree of sun-coral space \n\noccupation was examined on vertical walls (with 3 different coral cover levels) and the differences found \n\namong two study sites and areas, within each study site were examined. It was observed that the sun \n\ncoral may exclude major invertebrate groups (i.e. tanaids, ostracods and copepods). Abundance, biomass \n\nand richness of associated macrofaunal species declined in areas saturated by the sun coral, confirming \n\nthat this coral is an ecosystem engineer. \n\nThe structure of the food web associated to the colonies of Tubastraea spp was previously unknwon. \n\nAt the basis of this coral another invasive species is very often found, the bivalve Leiosolenus aristatus, \n\na borer species that perforates the base of hard corals. Stable isotopic analysis was applied to all \n\norganisms occurring at the microhabitat built by Tubastraea spp. to 1) provide the first trophic \n\ncharacterization of the food web facilitated by Tubastraea spp., while also 2) elucidating if L. aristatus \n\nreceives nutrition from its coral host Tubastraea spp. Stable isotopic analyses showed that the food web \n\nthat accompanies this invasive coral seems to be mostly composed of suspension feeders, confirming \n\nthat the new community established after Tubastraea spp. invasion is dominated by heterotrophs. It was \n\nalso concluded that both Tubastraea spp. and L. aristatus are suspension feeders consuming similar \n\nresources. This way, L. aristatus seems to profit from the expansion of Tubastraea spp. because the \n\ncoral provides it with a structure to live, but not a source of nutrition. As Tubastraea spp. progresses in \n\nits invasion of new areas, this borer bivalve should follow. \n\nThis work describes for the first-time the impact of Tubastraea spp. on the southeast Brazilian rocky \n\nbottoms\u2019 associated macrofauna and food webs. The rapid expansion of this ecosystem engineer is \n\nleading to the alteration of the native macrofaunal community. This work indicates that this invasion \n\nwill result in a decline in local biodiversity and in profound alterations to the food web of subtidal rocky \n\nshores. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Invasive species, Tubastraea spp., ecosystem engineer, stable isotopes, community structure \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\nTable of contents \n\nAcknowledgements .........................................................................................................................

To define all the Brazilian coast, AB\u2019S\u00c1BER (2003) divided the Brazilian coast in six sectors: \n\nEquatorial Amazonian Coast, North Northeast, East Northeast, East, Southeast, and South. The Northern \n\nregion (constituted by dunes, extensive sandy beaches with a considerable amount of rivers flowing \n\ndown, being the Amazon River mouth one of the greatest and most complex in the world); the Northeast \n\nregion (with more narrow beaches with sandstones reefs, which are often associated with calcareous \n\nalgae and corals reefs); beaches with fine to very fine sand can be found in the Eastern region of the \n\ncountry;  and the Southeast (where our study was carried out, at the north shore of S\u00e3o Paulo), which is \n\nthe most diverse and rugged coastal sector in the country, having distinct morphological characteristics \n\nfrom the northern and southern regions (Amaral et al., 2016). Temperate shallow reefs are mainly \n\ncovered by large browns macroalgae (Vermeij, 1978; Witman &amp; Dayton, 2001), while tropical and \n\nsubtropical reefs are dominated by a complex mosaic of very diverse assemblages of small macroalgae, \n\nmostly red and colonial fouling invertebrates (Witman &amp; Dayton, 2001; Oigman-Pszczol et al., 2004; \n\nPorter et al., 2013). \n\nLe\u00e3o &amp; Dominguez (2000) described the tropical Brazilian Coral Reefs as \u201cone of the most \n\nprominent marine ecosystems, particularly because of the unique character of its low-diversity coral \n\nfauna which is rich in endemic species\u201d. This statement indicates the great importance of Brazilian Coral \n\nReefs. They are distributed from 0\u00b050\u2019S to 18\u00b000\u2019S (Le\u00e3o et al., 2016). In the Southeastern and Southern \n\nregions, from the mouth of the Doce River (19\u00ba 30\u2019S) to the coast of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, no coral \n\nreef is known, although corals are present, including the endemic brain coral species Mussismilia hispida \n\n(Migotto, 1995; Migotto et al., 1999; Creed, 2006, Le\u00e3o et al., 2016).  \n\nDespite the heterogeneous distribution of corals along the Brazilian coast, corals can be found almost \n\nall over the coastline. The great latitudinal variance of the Brazilian coastline is under the influence of \n\na diverse set of oceanographic and ecological conditions. Locally, areas may be under the continuous \n\ninfluence of the oligotrophic tropical waters of the Brazilian Current, or seasonally affected by upwelling \n\nof cold, nutrient-rich waters (Ekau &amp; Knoppers, 1999). The nature of the substrate varies from rocky, \n\nto considerable coral cover, conferring the Brazilian coast a great diversity of ecosystems and associated \n\nspecies (Floeter et al., 2001). \n\n \n\n1.1.2 Invasive species \n\nThe term \u201cinvasive species\u201d is commonly used in the field of  \u201cinvasion ecology theory\u201d, but can be \n\nsubjectively interpreted (Colautti &amp; Macisaac, 2004). Non-indigenous species are those which can be \n\nfound outside off their native range, usually introduced by human activity (Colautti &amp; Macisaac, 2004). \n\nAlien, exotic, non-native and allochthonous species are all synonyms of non-indigenous species (NIS), \n\naccording to (Olenin et al., 2010). NIS can have four main stages: \u201clocalized and numerically rare\u201d, \n\n\u201cwidespread but rare\u201d, \u201clocalized but dominant\u201d or \u201cwidespread and dominant\u201d (Olenin et al., 2010). \n\nInvasive species are included in the \u201cwidespread and dominant\u201d stage of NIS because they are able to \n\nfix, to develop, to reproduce and to compete actively outside of their native range (Colautti &amp; Macisaac \n\n2004; Olenin et al., 2010). That means that invasive species are NIS, which are locally dominant and \n\nwidespread (Colautti &amp; Macisaac, 2004).  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nInvasive species are a serious threat to the local biodiversity community because they \u201cdisplace \n\nnative species, change community structure and food webs and alter fundamental processes (such as \n\nnutrient cycling and sedimentation)\u201d (Molnar et al., 2008). Hereupon, it is acceptable to define invasive \n\nspecies as \u201cany organism that is outside of its native geographic range that may or has become injurious \n\nto animal or human health, the economy and/or natural environment\u201d (Ziska et al., 2011).  \n\nDue to the increase in human population in the last decades, \u201cmany species have invaded and continue \n\nto invade new regions at an unprecedented rate, exerting strong impacts on ecosystems and human \n\nwelfare\u201d (Kleunen et al., 2010). Globalization is the main driver of invasive species introduction, the \n\nmajor vector being the international ship traffic (Murray et al., 2011; Chainho et al., 2015). Invasive \n\nspecies have some general characteristics in common, such as environmental tolerance, high genetic \n\nvariability, short generation time, early sexual maturity, high reproductive capacity, and a broad diet \n\n(Essink &amp; Dekker, 2002; Parker et al., 2013). All these attributes, together with proliferation in \n\necosystems without natural enemies, provide the ideal conditions for the highly successful establishment \n\nof the species in new regions and, consequently, for the invasion in those areas (Torchin et al., 2003). \n\nTypically, invasive species have a rapid establishment rate on non-invaded areas because of their \n\ngreat capacity for rapid dispersal and colonization. This phenomenon is accelerated in marine \n\nenvironments, due to the lack of natural barriers, leading to a risk of native biological heritage loss (Ruiz \n\net al., 2000; Secord, 2003; Sammarco et al., 2010). On the other hand, there are some studies that support \n\nthat NIS cannot be harmful to the native species, and invasional meltdowns can occur (Simberloff &amp; \n\nHolle, 1999; Parker et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n1.1.3 The sun coral (genus Tubastraea Lesson, 1829) and the beginning of its invasion \n\nThe present study focuses on the ahermatypic/azooxanthellate scleractinian coral, of the genus \n\nTubastraea Lesson, 1829 (Order: Scleractinia Bourne, 1900; Suborder: Dendrophylliina Vaughan and \n\nWells, 1943; Familly: Dendrophylliidae Gray, 1847), commonly called \u201csun coral\u201d or \u201corange cup \n\ncoral\u201d because of its orange/yellow pigmentation (De Paula &amp; Creed, 2004; Sammarco et al., 2010).  \n\nThe natural range of the sun coral Tubastraea spp. is the Indo-Pacific region and it has two main species \n\n(T. coccinea and T. tagusensis), which are at the epicentre of the invasion (Creed et al., 2016), even \n\nthough T. coccinea had a greater research effort by the scientific community. In general terms, both are \n\nhermaphrodites with a vast reproductive strategy, with sexual and asexual reproduction, both have a \n\ngreat planulae release, a great fixing capacity in natural (cave ceilings and undersides of big rocks) or \n\nartificial (dock pilings and buoys) substract, high recruitment and growth rates and settlement preference \n\nin vertical surfaces (Cairns, 2000; Creed &amp; De Paula, 2007; De Paula et al., 2014; Mizrahi et al., 2014 \n\n(b)). However, there are some differences between both species, such as that T. tagusensis seems to be \n\nmore sensitive to environmental changes (e.g. water temperature variation), the depths at which they \n\ncan occur (T. coccinea from 1 to 110 m in its native range and until 16m at Ilhabela, Brazil; T. tagusensis \n\nfrom 3 to 43 m in Galapagos region and until 15m in Ilhabela, Brazil), the growth rate (T. coccinea with \n\n1.01 cm/year against 0.92 cm/year in Brazil), as well as it being documented that T. coccinea has a \n\nlonger reproductive period than T. tagusensis (Wells, 1982; Glynn &amp; De Weerdt, 1991; Creed &amp; De \n\nPaula, 2007; De Paula et al., 2014; Mizrahi, 2014; Creed et al., 2016). Sun coral (a direct translation of \n\ncoral-sol in Portuguese) is the term that has been used, by researchers in Brazil, when referring to the \n\ntwo Tubastraea species (Mangelli &amp; Creed, 2012; De Paula et al., 2014; Creed et al., 2017) invading \n\nBrazilian shores. Independently of the species, all of the previously mentioned features make the sun \n\ncoral the most rapidly invading species of the Brazilian rocky shore, negatively affecting the native \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nbiodiversity, as evidenced by the decreasing population of the endemic Brazilian brain coral Mussismilia \n\nhispida. (Creed, 2006).  \n\nThe sun coral invasion started in the Caribbean Sea (first recorded in 1943 by Vaughan &amp; Wells) and \n\nbegan its descent towards Southwestern Atlantic (late 1980s), passing by the Gulf of Mexico and Florida \n\n(1977) ( Cairns, 2000; Castro et al., 1999; Fenner &amp; Banks, 2004; De Paula &amp; Creed, 2004). De Paula \n\n&amp; Creed (2004), reported that the orange cup coral invasion in Brazil started in the late 1980s, when \n\nsome specimens were found at offshore oil platforms in the northern region of Rio de Janeiro State, at \n\nthe Campos oil basin. After that, colonies were identified in Ilha Grande bay (1990s) and Itaja\u00ed, Santa \n\nCatarina State (2000). Joel Creed (2016) and his colleagues concluded that T. coccinea is native in the \n\nIndo-Pacific, cryptogenic in the North Pacific and North-eastern Atlantic, and invasive in the Caribbean \n\nSea, Gulf of Mexico and Southwestern Atlantic. On the other hand, it is possible to assume that T. \n\ntagusensis has a significantly smaller distribution around the world, being native to the Galapagos, \n\ncryptogenic in Indo-Pacific and Persian Gulf, and invasive in Southwestern Atlantic. It is important to \n\nmention that the sampling region for the present study was S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s north shore where the first sun \n\ncoral colonies were recorded in Ilhabela, between 2008 and 2010. (Mantelatto et al., 2011).  \n\n \n\n1.1.4 The sun coral as an ecosystem engineer   \n\n\u201cEcosystem engineer\u201d can be defined as \u201can organism whose presence or activity alters the physical \n\nsurroundings or changes the flow of resources, creating or modifying habitats and influencing all \n\nassociated species\u201d and that \u201cmodulates the availability of resources to other species, by causing \n\nphysical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials, so, they modify, maintain and create habitats\u201d (Jones \n\net al., 1994; Jones et al., 1997). The \u201cecosystem engineering\u201d concept proposed by Jones et al., (1994, \n\n1997) was accepted by some authors (Dangerfield et al., 1998; Casas-Crivill\u00e9 &amp; Valera, 2005; Wild et \n\nal., 2011), trivialized by others (Holdsworth et al., 2007; Menge et al., 2008), criticized (Reichman &amp; \n\nSeabloom, 2002) and updated by Andrew Wilby (2002). This concept caught the attention of many \n\necologists, for the most varied reasons. \n\nThe present study will use the concept given by Jones (1994, 1997), exploring the idea that an \n\necosystem engineer is responsible for changing the ecosystem, being a biodiversity mechanism of \n\nexclusion or facilitation. Ferreira (2003) and Lages et al. (2011) reported the important impact of \n\nTubastraea spp. on native local biodiversity of Brazilian rocky shores. Creed (2006) showed how the \n\nsun coral can cause tissue necrosis on the endemic Brazilian brain coral Mussismilia hispida and \n\nhighlighted the possibility of sponges, coralline algae and even sun coral recruits overgrowing in the \n\ninvaded regions (Creed, 2006).   \n\n \n\n1.1.5 Aims and scopes of the dissertation \n\nGiven that the sun coral is an important invasive species in the Southwestern Atlantic, and that its \n\nproliferation in non-native regions is a serious threat to the local biodiversity maintenance (Lages et al., \n\n2011; Silva et al., 2011; Mizrahi et al., 2014 (a)), it is important to understand the impact of this invasion \n\nand its trophic role in the rocky shore ecosystem. \n\nThe present work aimed to investigate the impact of Tubastraea spp. in the local biological \n\ncommunity, examining the rocky shore associated macrofauna under three different levels of coral \n\ncoverage (100%, 50% and 0%), (chapter 2) and to characterize the food web associated with Tubastraea \n\nspp., using stable isotopes (chapter 3), in an area under rapid invasion, southeast Brazil.  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n1.2 References  \n\nAB\u2019S\u00c1BER, A.

Tubastraea spp., commonly designed as sun coral, is an ahermatypic and \n\nazooxanthellate scleractinian coral, being the only scleractinian which has been introduced in Brazilian \n\nwaters, one of the most widespread invaders and it is becoming a serious threat to the local biodiversity. \n\nThe present work aimed to investigate the impact of Tubastraea spp. in the local biological community, \n\nexamining 1) the associated macrofauna on vertical rocky reef substrates with 3 different coral cover \n\n(0%, 50% and 100%) and 2) understand the differences found among study sites (PEL and POL) and \n\nareas (PEL1 and PEL 2; POL1 and POL 2), during the Summer of 2017 in an area under rapid invasion, \n\nat B\u00fazios Island, SP, Brazil. It was observed that sun coral may exclude (i.e. tanaids, ostracods and \n\ncopepods) major invertebrate groups. Abundance, biomass and richness declined in areas saturated by \n\nthe sun coral. The potential role of sun coral as an ecosystem engineer for the local community structure \n\nwas confirmed.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Invasive species, Tubastraea spp., ecosystem engineer, exclusion, community structure. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n2.2 Introduction \n\nIn general, corals are considered extremely sensitive to environmental change and have low survival \n\nrates during transport (Lages et al., 2011). The sun coral, Tubastraea spp., belongs to the group of \n\norganisms that seems to have a great resilience to environmental exchanges, high recruitment and \n\ngrowth rates \u2013 the invasive species main features that allow them to invade (Bax et al., 2003). The sun-\n\ncoral is the only scleractinian that is invasive in Brazilian waters (De Paula &amp; Creed, 2005).  \n\nThe Brazilian southeast coast has a great ecosystem complexity, with a wide range of habitats and \n\nreefs mainly covered by small macroalgal beds and associated macrofauna, which are the primary \n\nproduction and primary consumers, respectively. Lubchenko (1978) demonstrate that the abundance and \n\nalgae species are controlled by marine herbivorous. Moderate grazing allows inferior algal species to \n\npersist and intense grazing eliminates most individuals and species. The effect of this consumers on \n\nplant species diversity depends on the relationship between herbivore food preference and competitive \n\nabilities of the plants. Space has been shown to be a primary limiting resource in many rocky intertidal \n\ncommunities (Paine, 1966; Lubchenco &amp; Menge, 1978).  \n\nOn rocky bottoms ecosystems it is possible to find communities of sessile benthic invertebrates and \n\nmacroalgae matrix, both with different associated macrofauna and algae species, which will attract \n\ndiverse species of consumers with diversified food habits. The precise consumer effect, probably, \n\ndepends on the relationship between its preferences and food\u2019s competitive abilities and on the intensity \n\nof the grazing or predation pressure (Lubchenko, 1978). Mobile invertebrates such as small crustaceans \n\n(copepods, tanaids, ostracods, amphipods and isopods), bivalves, gastropods and polychaetas are, \n\nmainly, detritivores and suspension feeders, fundamental organisms for primary predators such as \n\njuvenile fishes, included fishes with high economic value (Floeter et al., 2007). Coasts invaded by the \n\nsun coral in Brazil have changed from being dominated by macroalgae and zooxanthellate cnidarians to \n\nbeing dominated by this azooxanthellate hard coral, thus changing from autotrophic to heterotrophic \n\ncommunities (Lages et al., 2011). \n\nScleractinian corals are ecosystem engineers that create microhabitats and modify nearby physical \n\nand chemical processes because they are principle architects (Lages et al., 2011). Tubastraea spp, once \n\nestablished, tends to dominate altering community structure and function (De Paula, 2007, Miranda et \n\nal., 2016). An ecosystem engineer can be considered as an organism responsible for creating or \n\nmodifying habitats, influencing all associated species around (Jones et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1997). \n\nAutogenic and allogenic engineers are the two main groups of ecosystem engineers (Jones et al., 1994). \n\nCorals, in general, are considered autogenic engineers whose alter the surrounding environment via their \n\nown physical structures (i.e. their living and dead tissues) (Jones et al., 1994).  \n\nGiven that the sun coral is an important invasive species in the Southwestern Atlantic, and its \n\nproliferation in non-native regions is a serious threat to the local biodiversity maintenance (Lages et al., \n\n2011; Silva et al., 2011; Mizrahi et al., 2014 (a)), it is important to understand the impact of this invasion \n\nand its trophic role in the rocky shore ecosystem. \n\nThe present work aimed to investigate the impact of Tubastraea spp. in the local biological \n\ncommunity, examining 1) the associated macrofauna on vertical rocky reef substrates with 3 different \n\ncoral cover (0%, 50% and 100%) and 2) understand the differences found among study sites (PEL and \n\nPOL) and areas (PEL1 and PEL 2; POL1 and POL 2), in an area under rapid invasion, at B\u00fazios Island, \n\nSP, Brazil. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n2.3 Materials and Methods \n\n2.3.1 Study area \n\nThis study was undertaken at Ilha de B\u00fazios (B\u00fazios Island: 23 48\u2019 11\u201d S; 45 08\u2019 21\u201d W), which \n\nbelongs to the Ilhabela Archipelago off-shore S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, Southeastern Brazil (Fig.2.1). B\u00fazios \n\nIsland is 755 ha large and is inhabited by nearly 200 people. Artisanal fisheries is the main economic \n\nactivity in the area. The island is located 8 km northwest off Ilhabela and 25 km southeast from the \n\nnearest mainland. A tropical climate prevails in the region, with hot and humid summers, when tropical \n\nstorms are frequent, and a drier winter. Coastal waters are often oligotrophic to mesotrophic, with \n\neventual pulses of primary production during summer, owing to episodical upwelling after prolonged \n\nperiods of northwesterly winds, and winter, after the passage of cold fronts (Stech &amp; Lorenzzetti, 1992, \n\nCalado et al., 2006; Ciotti et al., 2010). Coastal plumes containing large inputs of terrestrial organic \n\nmatter are frequent after heavy rainfall, but their contribution to benthic food webs is largely unknown. \n\nThe relative abundance of benthic macroalgae and sessile or encrusting invertebrates that dominate the \n\nshallow rocky reefs in the study area is given in Mizrahi et al. (2017). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Sampling \n\nWe aimed to investigate how mobile invertebrate assemblages change according to the degree of sun \n\ncoral space occupation. During the summer of 2017, we surveyed vertical rocky reef substrates, at a \n\ndepth ranging from 3 to 15m, at two areas several tens of meters apart (PEL1 and PEL2; POL1 and \n\nPOL2), within two sites nearly 3 km from each other (Pedra Lisa - PEL; S 23\u00b047\u201954.2\u201d; W 45\u00b009\u201924.6\u201d; \n\nand Ponta Leste - POL; S 23\u00b048\u20196.79\u201d; W 45\u00b0 7\u201921.65\u201d; Fig.2.1). At each area, three replicate plots (0.5 \n\nm\n2 \nquadrats) were haphazardly sampled at each of three habitat types; no coral, half coral cover (around \n\n50%), and full coral cover. Sun coral colonies were removed with chisels and encrusting invertebrates \n\nor turf / canopy-forming algae were scrapped off the substrates and suctioned using an air-lifting device \n\ncoupled to SCUBA tanks (Munro, 2013).  \n\nFig.2.1 Representative map of (A) Brazil and S\u00e3o Paulo location in South \nAmerica, (B) B\u00fazios Island location at Northeast of Ilhabela and (C) Samplig sites \n\nregion in B\u00fazios Island: Pedra Lisa (PEL) and Ponta Leste (POL).  \n\nBrazil \n\nN \n\nB\u00fazios \n\nPEL \n\nPOL \n\nA C \n\nB \n\n2000 Km 2 Km \n\n24 Km \n\nSP \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n2.3.3 Laboratory procedures \n\nAll samples were vigorously washed to release mobile invertebrates from any surfaces, and then \n\nsieved in different size classes (mm) to obtain estimates of average individual size (i.e. 0.5-1.2, 1.2-1.7, \n\n1.7-2.8, 2.8-4.0, 4.0-6.3, 6.3-8.0, 8.0-12.5, 12.5-25.0). All organisms were preserved in a saline \n\nformaldehyde (4%) solution. Identification to main taxonomic groups and counting were carried out on \n\nwhite trays, with the naked eye, for individuals retained in the six coarser sieves (i.e. with a body size \n\nlarger than 1.7mm), or under a dissecting microscope, for smaller individuals. Subsamples were \n\nobtained for size fractions retaining an exceedingly high number of individuals (n ? 150 indivuduals). \n\nA Folsom plankton splitter was used for this purpose because very large numbers were only observed \n\nfor very small organisms, in the smallest fractions, that could be easily suspended in the rotating drum. \n\nAll organisms were stored in containers with ethanol 70%. \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Data analyses \n\nUnivariate variables abundance, biomass, average size, Shannon-Wiener diversity and richness, and \n\nthe multivariate variable community structure, were all analysed using the same mixed linear model, \n\nwith the fixed main factor \u2018coral cover\u2019 (no coral, half-coral cover, full coral cover), examined at both \n\nthe \u2018site\u2019 (POL, PEL) and \u2018area\u2019 (nested in \u2018site\u2019; 1, 2) spatial scales (both random factors). For \n\nunivariate variables, variance heterogeneity was first tested using the Cochran\u2019s C test, appropriate data \n\ntransformations were undertaken when needed to meet homoscedasticity, and F-ratios were obtained \n\nthrough analyses of variance. The SNK procedure was used for post-hoc comparisons to further explore \n\nsignficant sources of variation. Community structure was examined using permutational analyses of \n\nvariance to generate pseudo\u2013F statistics. Data were first fourth-root transformed and the resemblance \n\nmatrix was calculated using Bray-Curtis distances. Significant sources of variation were further \n\ninvestigated using pairwise comparisons, based on 9,999 unrestricted permutations of raw data. Non-\n\nmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDs) plots were used to visualize sample clustering. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n2.4 Results \n\nAnalyses of univariate metrics of the sampled invertebrate assemblages indicate that effects of sun-\n\ncoral are complex. There were no pervasive changes across the spatial scales tested, with differences \n\namong assemblages holding only at sites, separated by a few km, or only even at areas within sites, just \n\ntens of meters apart (Table 2.1). Abundance followed the former trend (Table 2.1; Fig. 2.2A). There was \n\na clear decreasing tendency in invertebrate overall abundance from no-coral to full-coral cover habitats \n\nin Pedra Lisa, with statistical support for higher abundance at no-coral compared to the remainder \n\nhabitats, while at Ponta Leste abundance was higher at the half-coral habitat compared to the others \n\n(SNK; p &lt;0.05). Biomass contrasts were consistent in Pedra Lisa, higher on no-coral and half-coral \n\ncompared to full-coral plots, but not in Ponta Leste, where biomass was higher on half-coral compared \n\nto the rest at Area 2, but no differences were observed at Area 1 (Table 2.1; Fig. 2.2B). Decreasing \n\noverall trends of richness, especially no-coral and half-coral compared to full-coral cover, were observed \n\nacross areas (Fig. 2.2C) and backed by a marginal, although not significant, p-value (0.067; Table 2.1). \n\nProcesses not addressing here and operating at the \u2018area\u2019 spatial scale (Table 2.1), were important and \n\nprobably masked any effects of the sun-coral cover. No effects on average individual size or diversity \n\nwere detected (Table 2.1). \n\n \n\n \n\nSixteen major taxonomic groups were found in this study (Fig. 2.3). Amphipods, polychaetes and \n\ntanaids clearly dominated target assemblages, followed by copepods, ostracods, isopods, gastropods and \n\nbivalves which were common, and brachyuran crabs and ophiuroids which were only occasional. Other \n\nfive groups, i.e. nemerteans, nematodes, hermit crabs, caridean shrimps and sea urchins, accounted \n\nseparately for less than 1% of the whole sample and were considered rare. \n\n        Abundance   Biomass   Average size   Diversity   Richness \n\n    d.f.

The exception is Area 1 at Pedra Lisa (Fig. 2.4A). Pairwise comparisons \n\ndid not however fully support visual trends. Marginal p-values, between 0.093 and 0.104, were obtained \n\nfor contrasts of no coral vs. half-coral cover (PEL1; Fig. 2.4A), no coral vs. full-coral cover (PEL1, \n\nPEL2, POL1, POL2; Fig. 2.4A-D), and half-coral vs. full-coral cover (PEL2, POL2; Fig. 2.4B,D). Seven \n\ntaxonomic groups contributed substantially (above 10%) to at least one pairwise comparison, and 2 to \n\n3 groups were typically responsible for cumulative 50% dissimilarity across comparisons (SIMPER; \n\nTable 2.3). The abundance of taxonomic groups contributing the most to dissimilarities in each area is \n\nshown in Figure 2.5. Abundance patterns of tanaids (Fig. 2.5A-C), ostracods (Fig. 2.5A-B) copepods \n\n(Fig. 2.5B-C) and, to a lesser extent, gastropods (Fig. 2.5D) apparently underlie the clustering of no-\n\ncoral and half-coral cover plots, apart from full-coral cover plots. The distribution of polychaetes follows \n\na similar pattern, except for PEL1 (Fig. 2.5C). Exceedingly high variance to average ratios precluded a \n\nclear interpretation of the patterns observed for amphipods and isopods (Fig. 2.5 C-D). \n\n  \n\nFig. 2.3 Overall distribution of frequencies of the main taxonomic groups found at the sampled reef sites.

Although there were some spatial \n\ninconsistencies at different scales, a case is made for a frequent tipping point between half and full coral \n\ncover, beyond which main taxonomic groups (i.e. tanaids, copepods and ostracods) become much less \n\nabundant or collapse. Most vertical or nearly-vertical walls at B\u00fazios Island present a sun-coral cover \n\nvarying within this range, indicating that resilience to further increase of sun coral abundance is very \n\nunlikely.   \n\nChanges in the abundance and of main invertebrate groups and community structure are apparently \n\nrelated to the loss of the intricate physical structure of several native fouling species, as the sun coral \n\ncover becomes predominant. Compared to temperate shallow reefs where most complex habitat consists \n\nof large brown macroalgal beds, namely fucoids and kelps (Vermeij, 1978; Witman &amp; Dayton, 2001), \n\ntropical and subtropical rocky reefs are usually dominated by a complex mosaic of very diverse \n\nassemblages of small macroalgae, mostly red, colonial fouling invertebrates, such as sponges, ascidians \n\nand bryozoans, and both soft and hard corals (Witman &amp; Dayton, 2001; Oigman-Pszczol et al., 2004; \n\nPorter et al., 2013). In southeastern Brazil, filamentous and articulated coralline algal turfs, together \n\nwith canopy-forming algae such as Sargassum, Hypnea, Laurencia and Padina build up major habitats \n\nwithin healthy reefs (Oigman-Pszczol et al., 2004), and aggregate diverse fish assemblages (Floeter et \n\nal., 2007) at higher densities compared to other important coastal systems (Eggersten et al., 2017). It is \n\nstill unclear whether fish use those reef vegetated habitats as shelter or foraging grounds, but the latter \n\nis very probable as seaweeds tend to aggregate very high densities of potential prey (Tano et al., 2016). \n\nThe complex structure of most seaweeds also favours the accumulation of sediments and detritus coming \n\nfrom land by frequent rain showers and local hydrodynamics, adding environmental heterogeneity at \n\nspatial scales within the range of body sizes of common accompanying fauna (Airoldi, 2003). The mixed \n\nmatrix of algal tissues and trapped sediments is preferential habitat for an array of invertebrate groups, \n\nincluding tanaids, ostracods and copepods (Berghe &amp; Bergmans, 1981; Danielpool et al., 1996; Pereira \n\net al., 2014). This likely explains why those groups were almost absent at patches saturated by sun corals \n\nin B\u00fazios Island. Interestingly, the effects on amphipods, which include several species that directly \n\ngraze on host algal tissues (Neckles et al., 1993; Duffy &amp; Hay, 2000), were not affected in any evident \n\nway. This reinforces the notion that the provision of physical complexity, not the supply of algal tissues \n\nto mesoherbivores, drives the abundance and distribution of the main invertebrate groups found in \n\nsamples.     \n\nThe crustacean groups that were most affected by the sun coral invasion at Ilha de B\u00fazios are all very \n\nimportant prey for larval and juvenile nearshore fish. Tanaids were the most abundant group in areas \n\nwith only partial or no sun coral cover. Because they rank among the most important food items for \n\nintermediate fish size-groups (5.0-10.0 cm; Pereira et al., 2014), their exclusion as patches develop to \n\nsun coral saturation may negatively impact fish populations. Tanaids have also low dispersal capacity \n\n(Pereira et al., 2014) and therefore migration from seaweed to coral-dominated habitat (i.e. \n\nrecolonization) is very unlikely. Ostracods and harpacticoid copepods are not only consumed by early \n\nfish stages but also considered important trophic links in bentho-pelagic food webs. Ostracods are a \n\nmajor food source for many vertebrate and invertebrate species (Mbahinzireki et al., 1991) and \n\nharpacticoids, the most abundant copepods in this study, are an important food source for penaeid shrimp \n\nand many larval and juvenile fish species (Nelson &amp; Coull, 1989; Pinto et al., 2001). Unlike the complex \n\nseaweed architecture, sun coral colonies do not provide interstitial spaces compatible to the size of small \n\ncrustaceans, and do not retain sediments or detritus that can be used as food sources (Airoldi, 2003; \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nBerghe &amp; Bergmans, 1981; Danielpool et al., 1996). The rapid invasion of Tubastraea spp. may \n\ntherefore alter the nearshore trophic web and lead to the loss of endemic fauna and flora. In the worst \n\ncase-scenario declines of small mobile invertebrate groups which are prey for demersal consumers may \n\naffect whole ecosystem services, particularly artisanal fisheries aiming reef species.  \n\nPolychaetes were also affected by the presence of sun corals but this group was present in all samples, \n\nincluding patches fully covered by the orange cup coral. Effects on lower taxonomic levels, not \n\naddressed in this study, may underlie their generalized occurrence at the different reef habitats. \n\nPolychaetes exhibit remarkable functional diversity (Wouters et al., 2018), with many groups \n\nsuccessfully colonizing hard bottoms (Hutchings, 1981; Gobin, 2010). On reef habitats, polychaetes are \n\nmostly found in crevices or holes within calcareous rock (Nogueira et al., 2001), providing shelter \n\nagainst predators and the supply of different food sources, including debris, small invertebrates and \n\nalgae. Nogueira and Martin (2002) found that the endemic Brazilian brain coral Mussismilia hispida \n\n(Verril, 1868) supports a very rich and diverse assemblage of polychaetes, similarly as reported by others \n\nfor coral habitats in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, as well as other Atlantic regions \n\n(Mccloskey, 1970; Kohn &amp; Lloyd, 1973; Arvanitidis &amp; Koukouras, 1994). While providing important \n\nphysical structure to reef habitats, sun corals may also exert strong negative allelopathic effects. For \n\ninstance, Creed (2006) showed that sun corals infringe necrosis on Mussismilia hispida colonies up to a \n\ndistance of five centimetres. Negative allelopathy through the release of water-borne toxic substances \n\n(Coll et al., 1982; Sammarco et al., 1983; Gunthorpe &amp; Cameron, 1990) may not only intensify \n\ninterspecific competition for the occupation of primary space, but also restrict coral habitat to species \n\nthat tolerate the presence of toxic substances to some extent. It is known that some polychaete species \n\nare associated to toxic sponges (Skilleter et al., 2005), and can absorb low concentrations of different \n\ntoxins and heavy metals (Bryan &amp; Hummerstone, 1971; Mebs, 1998). It is possible that the widespread \n\noccurrence of polychaetes over the different reef habitats at B\u00fazios Island is a result of their generalized \n\ntolerance to water-borne allelochemicals. \n\nThe trends discussed above are however prone to substantial change at the spatial scales examined. \n\nMost important, the effects of sun coral abundance were clearer at Pedra Lisa (PEL) compared to Ponta \n\nLeste (POL). PEL is a relatively sheltered area, facing north, while POL is close to the eastern end of \n\nB\u00fazios Island, and thus more frequently exposed to the larger swell that build from prevailing easterly \n\nwinds (Fontes &amp; Castro, 2017). Because this coastal region is often oligotrophic (Ciotti et al. 2010), \n\nwind-driven upwelling and wave-action more likely impacting POL may substantially increase nutrient \n\nsupply and the flow of feeding particles to invertebrate consumers. Those effects may partially obscure \n\nthe effects of sun coral cover. Smaller scale inconsistencies, as shown for richness, are more difficult to \n\ninterpret. Differences in richness are often dictated by the distribution patterns of rare groups, which, in \n\nturn, may reflect the occurrence of the host biogenic habitat, such as sponges, ascidians and particular \n\nalgal canopies to name a few microhabitats that may play an important role in rocky reef systems. Even \n\nat nearly saturated coral patches, secondary habitat built by filamentous algae, solitary ascidians \n\nPhallusia nigra or even small clumps of mytilid bivalves Isognomon bicolor, may host distinct species \n\nassemblages. Clearly, further work is needed to tease apart potential factors that may operate at smaller \n\nspatial scales.  \n\nInvasive species can be considered a great threat to marine ecosystems, displacing native species and \n\nultimately causing overall changes of community structure, food-web topologies and ecosystem \n\nfunctioning (De Paula &amp; Creed, 2005; Molnar et al., 2008). Moreover, invasive species such as sun \n\ncorals are autogenic engineers, as long as their own physical structure modifies the surrounding \n\nenvironment (Jones et al., 1994). We report severe impacts of the sun coral invasion on populations of \n\nmajor invertebrate groups, chiefly tanaids, ostracods and copepods, deeply modifying community \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nstructure when coral cover exceeds 50%. Our findings add to the results of Mizrahi and colleages (2016), \n\nwho suggested higher impacts at habitat patches where the diversity of native fouling assemblages is \n\nhighest and reinforce the perception that the sun coral invasion will have far-reaching consequences. \n\nVast areas of shallow-water reef habitat at B\u00fazios Island, as well as other places (e.g. Ilha Grande, RJ), \n\nare invaded by sun-corals beyond tipping point estimates and there is no evidence supporting any \n\nreversals of past invasive trends. Given that long-standing reef ecosystem services might be \n\ncompromised, including artisanal fisheries, this study further highlights the need to control the sun coral \n\nspread and its eradication at places where its occurrence is still restricted and removal efforts feasible.   \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n2.6 References \n\nAiroldi, L.

It is also an ecosystem engineer that once established, tends to dominate altering \n\nthe local community structure and function. However, there are no studies on the food web associated \n\nto the colonies of Tubastraea spp. At the basis of this coral another invasive species is very often found, \n\nthe bivalve Leiosolenus aristatus, a borer species that perforates the base of hard corals. Stable isotopic \n\nanalysis was applied to all organisms occurring at the microhabitat built by Tubastraea spp to 1) provide \n\nthe first trophic characterization of the food web facilitated by Tubastraea spp., while also 2) elucidating \n\nif L. aristatus receives nutrition from its coral host Tubastraea spp. Stable isotopic analyses showed that \n\nthe food web that accompanies this invasive coral seems to be mostly composed of suspension feeders, \n\nconfirming that the new community established after Tubastraea spp. invasion is dominated by \n\nheterotrophs. It was also concluded that both Tubastraea spp. and L. aristatus are suspension feeders \n\nconsuming similar resources. This way, L. aristatus seems to profit from the expansion of Tubastraea \n\nspp. because the coral provides it with a structure to live, but not a source of nutrition. As Tubastraea \n\nspp. progresses in its invasion of new areas, this borer bivalve should follow. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Exotic species, ecosystem engineer, predator-prey interactions, stable isotopes. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n3.2 Introduction \n\nThe sun coral is the most rapidly invading species of the Brazilian rocky shore, negatively affecting \n\nthe native biodiversity, as evidenced by the decreasing population of the endemic Brazilian brain coral \n\nMussismilia hispida. (Creed, 2006). The natural range of the sun coral Tubastraea spp. is the Indo-\n\nPacific region and it has two main species (T. coccinea and T. tagusensis), which are at the epicentre of \n\nthe invasion in Brazil (Creed et al., 2016). The two species are very difficult to distinguish and thus we \n\nwill refer to them as Tubastraea spp. The sun coral invasion started in the Caribbean Sea (first recorded \n\nin 1943 by Vaughan &amp; Wells) and began its descent towards Southwestern Atlantic (late 1980s), passing \n\nby the Gulf  of Mexico and Florida (1977) (Castro et al., 1999; Cairns, 2000; De Paula &amp; Creed, 2004; \n\nFenner &amp; Banks, 2004). In Brazil, the first sun coral colonies were found in offshore oil platforms in \n\nCampos oil basin, Rio de Janeiro. Is notorious the rapid invasion by the scleractinian along the Brazilian \n\nshore, from north to south, in the last thirty years (De Paula &amp; Creed, 2004; Mantelatto et al., 2011). \n\nIn general terms, both species are hermaphrodites with a vast reproductive strategy \u2013 with sexual and \n\nasexual reproduction \u2013, early reproductive maturity, a great planulae release, a great fixing capacity in \n\nnatural (cave ceilings and undersides of big rocks) or artificial (dock pilings and buoys) substrate, high \n\nrecruitment and growth rates and settlement preference in vertical surfaces (Cairns, 2000; Creed &amp; De \n\nPaula 2007; De Paula et al. 2014; Mizrahi et al. 2014 (b); Creed et al., 2016). The orange cup coral is, \n\nalso, able to produce antifouling chemical compounds which prevent the fish and invertebrate predation \n\n(Creed et al., 2017). All the features previously mentioned, are the responsible for giving the \u201cinvasive \n\nspecies\u201d status to the sun coral, thus, are gathered all the conditions for a successful and rapid \n\nestablishment and proliferation in regions outside of their native range. An example of the rapid \n\nexpansion of this coral (De Paula et al., 2014) is the notorious invasion in areas where the presence of \n\nsun coral was rare and started to be abundant or dominant and, was estimated, in Ilha Grande (RJ, Brazil) \n\nregion an expansion rate of 2.1km/year (Lages et al., 2011; Creed et al., 2017).  \n\nLittle is known about the relationship established between borer bivalves and the organisms they \n\nperforate. Leiosolenus aristatus (Dillwyn, 1817) is a borer bivalve which its native range is the \n\nCaribbean Sea but with a large worldwide distribution. Is possible to find this specimen in the Pacific \n\nand Atlantic Ocean (from Portugal to Senegal on the North Atlantic and from North Carolina to \n\nVenezuela in the Western part of the Atlantic) (Simone &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, 2006; Lopes., 2011). In Brazil, \n\nthe first record of the invasion was in 2005 in two States, Rio de Janeiro e S\u00e3o Paulo (Simone &amp; \n\nGon\u00e7alves, 2006). Leiosolenus aristatus is the accepted scientific name nowadays but the genus of this \n\nmytilid it was, already, recognize as Litophaga (R\u00f6ding, 1798) and Myoforceps (Fischer 1886) (Lopes, \n\n2011). Despite this species had been several names in the past, its primary recognition is very simple if \n\nwe look to the pointed, crossed tips at the posterior part of the shells, which cross like fingers (Lopes, \n\n2011; Ignacio et al, 2012). The preferential habitat of the bivalve is hard surfaces, such as shells, corals \n\nand barnacles (Lopes, 2011), boring substrata and soft rocks from intertidal to 5m depth (Simone &amp; \n\nGon\u00e7alves, 2006; Ignacio et al., 2012). Having regard to the preferred habitat, is acceptable to admit \n\nthat we are talking about a species which needs to perforate to survive. Such perforation may have \n\npossible damage to native species, because the \u201cdatemussels\u201d (common name for the posterior part of \n\nthe shells being crossed like fingers) perforate the living shells, causing deformation of the host and \n\neven its death (Simone &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, 2006). Because of its habit of penetrating corals and because its \n\npresence often goes unnoticed initially, it may significantly change the structure of local coral \n\ncommunities and is considered an invasive species (Lopes, 2011). Mariculture can be the primary (even \n\nif is not an intended biological introduction vector) vector for the introduction of the species in the \n\nBrazilian coast but, also, ballast water and hull fouling are other potential vectors (Ignacio et al., 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nL. aristatus is native to the tropical Northwest Atlantic, thus the two species (the bivalve and the sun \n\ncoral) do not overlap at their native distribution range. The association between the two only occurs \n\nwhen their invasive ranges of distribution meet. There is no information on the trophic relations between \n\nthese two invasive species. \n\nStable isotopic analysis was applied to all macro-organisms occurring at the microhabitat built by \n\nTubastraea spp. agglomerates to 1) provide the first trophic characterization of the food web facilitated \n\nby Tubastraea spp. while also 2) elucidating if L. aristatus receives nutrition from its coral host \n\nTubastraea spp. \n\n \n\n3.3 Materials and Methods  \n\n3.3.1 Study area \n\nThe study area is in the B\u00fazios Island (23 48\u2019 11\u201d S; 45 08\u2019 21\u201d W), off the southeast coast of Brazil \n\n(Fig.3.1). The island has 7.5 km\n2\n and is scarcely inhabited, mostly by traditional fishermen. The climate \n\nis wet tropical. Summers in this area are typically warm and wet, with frequent tropical storms. The \n\nnumerous heavy rain showers (often more than once a day) mean that the input of terrestrial matter is \n\nhighly variable on a fine temporal and spatial scale. This way, punctual collection of particulate matter \n\n(POM) for stable isotope analyses will necessarily result in highly variable values. This also applies to \n\nphytoplankton and zooplankton. For this reason, sampling did not include POM, phytoplankton and \n\nzooplankton. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.1 Representative map of (A) Brazil and S\u00e3o Paulo location in South America, \n\n(B) B\u00fazios Island location at Northeast of Ilhabela and (C) Samplig sites region in \n\nB\u00fazios Island: Pedra Lisa (PEL) and Ponta Leste (POL). \n\nBrazil \n\nN \n\nB\u00fazios \n\nPEL \n\nPOL \n\nA C \n\nB \n\n2000 Km 2 Km \n\n24 Km \n\nSP \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n3.3.2 Sampling \n\nSampling took place during summer, in February of 2017, at two sites, PEL (S 23\u00b047?54.2\u201d - W \n\n45\u00b009?24.6\u201d) and POL (S 23\u00b048?6.79\u201c- W 45\u00b0 7?21.65\u201c) distanced approximately 3 km (Fig 3.1). Both \n\nsites have vertical rock walls covered with Tubastraea spp. At each site, a diver collected all organisms, \n\nwith a chisel and an air-lifting device coupled to SCUBA tanks (Munro, 2013), from two 0.5 m\n2\n squares \n\ndistanced approximately 5 m. Sampling was conducted at a mean depth of 5 m. Samples were preserved \n\non ice and taken to the laboratory at CEBIMar (Centre for Marine Biology of the University of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo).  \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Laboratory Procedures \n\nTentacles of Tubastraea spp. were plotted for stable isotope analysis. Muscle tissue samples were \n\ndissected from molluscs and crustaceans. Tissues of all species were dried at 60\u00baC and ground to fine \n\npowder with a mortar and pestle. \n\nThe isotopes analysed were ?\n13\n\nC and ?\n15\n\nN. These isotopes are commonly used for the description of \n\nfood webs in a wide variety of ecosystems because they allow the estimation of the food sources used \n\nby organisms over time, allowing a characterization of their feeding habits and trophic levels (Peterson \n\net al., 1985; Riera &amp; Richard, 1996; Kwak &amp; Zedler, 1997; Baeta et al., 2009; Vinagre et al., 2015).     \n\nThe carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of the samples was determined using a Flash EA 1112 \n\nSeries elemental analyser coupled on line via Finningan ConFlo III interface to a Thermo delta V S mass \n\nspectrometer. The carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios are expressed in delta (?) notation, defined as the \n\nparts per thousand (\u2030), a deviation from a standard material (PDB limestone for ?\n13\n\nC and atmospheric \n\nnitrogen for ?\n15\n\nN): ?\n13\n\nC or ?\n15\n\nN = [(Rsample/Rstandard) ? 1] \u00d7 1000, where R = \n13\n\nC/\n12\n\nC or \n15\n\nN/\n14\n\nN. The \n\nprecision in the overall preparation and analysis was better than 0.1\u2030 for ?\n13\n\nC and 0.3\u2030 for ?\n15\n\nN. \n\n \n\n3.3.4 Data Analysis \n\nAnalyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to test if Tubastraea spp, L. aristatus and \n\nCassostrea virginica showed isotopic differences. Both Tubastraea spp, L. aristatus have never been \n\nisotopically characterized, so we compared their values not only between each other but also with the \n\noyster C. virginica, which is a well-known suspension feeder and could thus be used as a reference. The \n\nANOVA assumptions were previously investigated. Normality was investigated through the Shapiro-\n\nWilk's test and homoscedasticity through Levene's test. A significance level of 0.05 was considered in \n\nall test procedures. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n3.4 Results \n\nThe food web associated with Tubastraea spp. seems to be dominated by primary consumers, most \n\nof them suspension feeders, like the ascidian Phallusia nigra, the sun sponge Hymeniacidon heliophila, \n\nthe barnacle Tetraclita stalacifera and the oyster Crassostrea virginica.  \n\nEleven species/groups were analysed in this study (Table 3.1, Fig 3.2). Two macroalgae were \n\nanalysed, the red macroalgae Amphiroa sp. and \u201cturf\u201d, a mix of small intertwined filamentous \n\nmacroalgae that are difficult to separate and were thus analysed as a bulk. Amphiroa sp. is clearly not \n\ncontributing to this food web, since its isotopic values are clearly distinct from those of all consumers. \n\nThe isotopic values of the mix we called \u201cturf\u201d are consistent with it being consumed by the two non-\n\nsuspension feeding species analysed, the speck-claw decorator crab Omalacantha bicornuta and the sea \n\nsnail Morula nodulosa (Table 3.1, Fig 3.2). Worms of the Nereididae family may also be feeding on \n\nturf. The barnacle Tetraclita stalactifera is also a well-known suspension feeder, however its isotopic \n\nvalues are more enriched in ?\n13\n\nC, than the other suspension feeders analysed (Table 3.1, Fig 3.2). The \n\nisotopic values of Tubastraea spp., L. aristatus and C. virginica did not present significant differences, \n\nneither in ?\n15\n\nN (F=3.023, P=0.068), nor in ?\n13\n\nC (F=1.229, P=0.311) (Fig. 3.3).  \n\n \n\nTaxa  N ?\n15N ?13C \n\nMacroalgae     \n\n Amphiroa sp. 3 1.65 (1.12) -3.68 (0.18) \n\n Turf (mix) 5 7.71 (0.70) -15.84 (0.76) \n\nPorifera     \n\n Hymeniacidon heliophila 4 8.18 (1.14) -18.49 (0.66) \n\nCnidaria     \n\n Tubastraea coccinea (tentacles) 6 8.24 (1.16) -18.27 (1.38) \n\nPolychaeta     \n\n Nereididae 14 9.72 (2.16) -18.39 (1.14) \n\nGastropoda     \n\n Morula nodulosa 6 10.09 (0.55) -16.37 (1.14) \n\nBivalvia     \n\n Crassostrea virginica 8 7.40 (1.04) -19.34 (0.81) \n\n Leiosolenus aristatus 12 7.01 (0.90) -19.13 (1.55) \n\nCrustacea     \n\n Omalacantha bicornuta 3 9.37 (0.76) -17.52 (1.33) \n\n Tetraclita stalactifera 6 8.67 (1.59) -14.47 (1.89) \n\nAscidiacea     \n\n Phallusia nigra 3 5.35 (0.03) -20.16 (0.07) \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nTable 3.1 Number of individuals/plots analysed and their mean ?15N and ?13C values (standard deviations in brackets). \n\n \n\n2017.

(2011), which stated that invaded rocky shores in Brazil change from being dominated \n\nby macroalgae and zooxanthellate cnidarians, autotrophic organisms, to being dominated by \n\nheterotrophic organisms. Furthermore, the non-suspension feeders analysed in the present study were \n\nalso heterotrophic organisms, the gastropod M. nodulosa, polychaetes from the Nereididae family and \n\nthe crab O. bicornuta. \n\nThe only autotrophs found were the macroalgae Amphiroa sp and the mix of filamentous algae we \n\ndesignated by \u201cturf\u201d. Fractionation at the base of this food web seems to be within what is usually \n\nassumed between trophic levels, which is an increase in 2.5-4.5 from prey to predator (Owens, 1987; \n\nPeterson &amp; Fry, 1987). That can be observed between ascidians, sponges, \u201cturf\u201d, and the primary \n\nconsumers, namely M. nodulosa, Nereididae polychaetes and O. bicornuta. However, the distinct \n\nisotopic values of Amphiroa sp indicate that this species does not contribute as nutrition for the primary \n\nconsumers. Only ascidians, sponges and \u201cturf\u201d had isotopic values consistent with being consumed by \n\norganisms higher up the food web.  \n\nIt must be pointed out that Tubastraea spp. isotopic values do not rule it out as a potential food source \n\nfor the primary consumers analysed in the present study, quite the opposite, its values are very similar \n\nto those of other species (sponges) that were pointed as probable food sources for the primary \n\nconsumers. However, this species has been described as having no natural predators (Campbell, 1983). \n\nIts rapid invasion capacity certainly suggests that it is free from predation, however studies on the \n\nfeeding behaviour of the gastropods, polychaetes and small crustaceans observed here, should elucidate \n\nif Tubastraea spp. has a role as food source for any consumers in its associated food web. Since no \n\nsignificant differences, neither in ?\n15\n\nN, nor in ?\n13\n\nC, were detected among Tubastraea spp., L. aristatus \n\nand C. virginica, it can be concluded that they share the same food source or a similar mix of food \n\nsources. Since, the oyster C. virginica, is a well-known suspension feeder, it can be concluded that these \n\nspecies are probably also feeding on suspended materials. The barbacle, T. stalactifera is also a well-\n\nknown suspension feeder, however its isotopic values were very distinct from those of the previously \n\nmentioned suspension feeders. T. stalactifera presented considerably more enriched ?\n13\n\nC values. \n\nThis wide difference in ?\n13\n\nC values at the food web basis is common in other coastal food webs and \n\nindicates the existence of two energy pathways, pelagic and benthic (Darnaude, 2005; Le Loc\u2019h et al., \n\n2008; Vinagre et al., 2015). The pelagic pathway originates in the photosynthetic activity from \n\nphytoplankton while the benthic pathways is based on detritus, carried from by currents and/or \n\ntransported by terrestrial drainage (Rafaelli &amp; Hawkins, 1999). Marine producers (especially \n\nphytoplankton) have more enriched ?\n13\n\nC values than terrestrial primary producers, this way allowing \n\nthe tracing of the origin of carbon in coastal environments (Haines &amp; Montague, 1979; Riera &amp; Richard, \n\n1996; Bouillon et al., 2000). T. stalactifera enriched ?\n13\n\nC values in comparison to the other suspension \n\nfeeders indicates that this species is probably mainly consuming phytoplankton, while the others are \n\nmostly consuming detritus. \n\nSince the isotopic evidence presented here suggests that L. aristatus is a suspension-feeder, feeding \n\non the same source as its host Tubastraea spp. it can be concluded that this invasive borer bivalve has \n\nits invasion facilitated by Tubastraea spp. because the coral provides structural refuge, not because it is \n\na source of nutrition. As the coral expands its invasion range, it creates a structural niche for the invasive \n\nbivalve to occupy. It should thus be expected that L. aristatus will follow Tubastraea spp. as it rapidly \n\ninvades new coasts.  \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n3.6 References \n\nBaeta, A., Pinto, R., Valiela, I., Richard, P., Niquil, N., Marques, J.C.

The results \n\nsuggest a higher abundance, diversity and richness of species in areas without or partially covered by \n\nthe sun-coral and on macroinvertebrates, such as tanaids, ostracods and copepods. On the other hand, \n\nan invasive bivalve is often found on the hard basis of Tubastraea spp. and the community structure \n\nassociated to the sun coral is, mainly, composed by heterotrophs instead of autotrophs organisms. These \n\nare clear evidences that the sun coral is an ecosystem engineer, acting as excluder of some species and \n\nfacilitator for other species, changing the habitat and all surrounding life.  \n\nThis study adds to the knowledge on the impact of the sun coral on the rocky shores of Brazil. Further \n\nresearch should lead to new insights into how environmental features, such as food availability, \n\ntemperature, depth and hydrodynamics, affect the invasion of this coral. It is also important to \n\nunderstand if there are mechanisms of sun coral exclusion. A potential bio-mechanism to slow down the \n\ninvasion is if the invasive bivalve L. aristatus makes the corals hard basis more likely to break because \n\nof its perforation. The mytilid could make the calcareous coral basis weaker and prone to break down \n\nduring storms. This would be a potential mechanism of exclusion of both invaders, the coral does not \n\nhave the ability to survive without a foundation and the bivalve would not have a sheltered place to live, \n\nprotected from predators. It is also possible that some native fish prey on the sun coral, like showed by \n\nMirzrahi et al. (2018) for the damsel Abudefduf saxatilis, in the same study area. Such fish, or any other \n\npredators, could eventually lower the rate of invasion of the sun coral.  \n\nIf the sun coral invasion does not stop (naturally or due to human intervention), the southwest \n\nAtlantic rocky bottoms are likely to continue to be severely invaded. The main consequence of this will \n\nbe a deep alteration of the local habitats, which means a radical change on the native biotic assemblages. \n\nIn general terms, an important alteration in the rocky shore food webs and marine biodiversity is taking \n\nplace at an accelerated rate, affecting the balance of the ecosystems and possibly the local economy via \n\na potential interreference with fisheries."}]}}}
