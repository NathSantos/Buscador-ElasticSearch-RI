da Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional (Minas Gerais, Brasil) \ndurante o Pleistoceno tardio e Holoceno usando uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o multi-proxy de \n\ntestemunhos de turfeiras tropicais de montanha \n \n\n As turfeiras s\u00e3o ecossistemas extremamente sens\u00edveis \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as da hidrologia, e \ns\u00e3o por excel\u00eancia consideradas como \"arquivos naturais da mem\u00f3ria ecol\u00f3gica\". Na Serra do \nEspinha\u00e7o Meridional, Minas Gerais, Brasil, as turfeiras de montanha vem sendo estudadas \npelos cientistas do solo, mas at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o estudos multi-proxy s\u00e3o quase ausentes. A localiza\u00e7\u00e3o \ndestas \u00e9 ideal pois est\u00e3o em uma \u00e1rea influenciada pela atividade do Sistema Mon\u00e7\u00f4nico da \nAm\u00e9rica do Sul (SMAS), que controlam a quantidade e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o anual. O \nobjetivo deste trabalho foi reconstruir as mudan\u00e7as ambientais ocorridas atrav\u00e9s do Holoceno \ne Pleistoceno Tardio, tanto sob escala local quanto regional, usando uma abordagem multi-\nproxy (estratigrafia, propriedades f\u00edsicas, data\u00e7\u00f5es 14C e LOE, p\u00f3len e geoqu\u00edmica). No \nentanto, determina\u00e7\u00e3o dos processos envolvidos na g\u00eanese e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos das turfeiras \ntamb\u00e9m foi um passo necess\u00e1rio. As propriedades f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas e composi\u00e7\u00e3o elementar de \ncinco testemunhos de turfa (PdF-I, PdF-II, SJC, PI e SV) de quatro turfeiras selecionadas (Pau \nde Fruta, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Chapada, Pinheiros e Sempre Viva) parecem ter respondido a quatro \nprocessos principais: acumula\u00e7\u00e3o relativa de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica e material mineral, ligados \u00e0 \nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos das bacias das turfeiras (eros\u00e3o local); deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de poeira de fontes \ndistantes/regionais; preserva\u00e7\u00e3o de restos de plantas; e decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da turfa em longo e \ncurto prazo. A combina\u00e7\u00e3o de proxies de PdF-I definiu seis principais fases de mudan\u00e7as \ndurante o Holoceno: (I) 10-7,4 mil anos cal AP, clima \u00famido e frio e instabilidade do solo na \nbacia da turfeira; (II) 7,4-4,2 mil anos cal AP, \u00famido e quente com solo na bacia est\u00e1vel e \naumento de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de poeiras regionais; (III) 4,2-2,2 mil anos cal AP, seco e quente e \nreativa\u00e7\u00e3o da eros\u00e3o do solo na bacia; (IV) 2,2-1,2 mil anos cal AP, seco e resfriamentos \npontuais, com aumento de poeiras regionais; (V) 1,2 mil anos-400 anos cal AP, sub-\u00famido e \ncom os mais baixas entradas de poeiras local e regionais e as maiores acumula\u00e7\u00f5es de turfa; e \n(VI)&lt;400 anos cal AP, sub-\u00famido com forte eros\u00e3o local e regional. Para o Pleistoceno \ntardio, uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de proxies aplicada para PI tamb\u00e9m definiu seis principais fases: (I) \n60-39,2 mil anos cal AP, de sub-\u00famido para seco em meio \u00e0 temperaturas mais frias que o \natual, e alta instabilidade do solo na bacia da turfeira; (II) 39,2-27,8 mil anos cal AP, seco e \nquente com alguns resfriamentos e ainda sob elevadas taxas de eros\u00e3o local; (III) 27,8-16,4 \nmil anos cal AP, \u00famido e muito frio com redu\u00e7\u00e3o da eros\u00e3o do solo na bacia; (IV) 16,4-6,6 \nmil anos cal AP, muito \u00famido e muito frio com baixa intensidade de eros\u00e3o local; (V) 6,6-3,3 \nmil anos cal AP, muito seco e quente com taxas crescentes de eros\u00e3o local; e (VI)&lt;3,3 mil \nanos cal AP, de seco e quente para sub-\u00famido, com tend\u00eancia de eros\u00e3o local semelhante ao \nper\u00edodo anterior.  O clima \u00e9 visto como o for\u00e7ante mais importante das mudan\u00e7as ambientais, \nmas \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que atividades humanas tenham sido parcialmente respons\u00e1veis pelas \nmudan\u00e7as significativas registradas ao longo dos \u00faltimos 400 anos. Dado o valor como \narquivos ambientais, as turfeiras da Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional devem ser completamente \nprotegidas.  \n \nPalavras-chave: Turfeiras tropicais; Organossolos; P\u00f3len; Geoqu\u00edmica; Is\u00f3topos; An\u00e1lise por \n\ncomponentes principais  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nLate Pleistocene-Holocene environmental change in Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional \n(Minas Gerais State, Brazil) reconstructed using a multi-proxy characterization of peat \n\ncores from mountain tropical mires \n \n\n The peatlands are ecosystems extremely sensitive to changes in hydrology, and are \nconsidered as faithful \"natural archives of ecological memory\". In the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o \nMeridional, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, mountain peatlands has been studied by soil scientists, \nbut until now multi-proxy studies are almost absent. The location of these peatlands is ideal \nbecause they are in an area influenced by the activity of the South America Monsoon Systems \n(SAMS), which controls the amount and distribution of annual rainfall. The aim of this work \nwas to reconstruct the environmental changes occurred throughout the late Pleistocene and \nHolocene, both at the local and regional scale by using a multi-proxy approach (stratigraphy, \nphysical properties, 14C and OSL datings, pollen and geochemistry). However, determining of \nthe processes involved in the genesis and evolution of peatlands soils was also necessary step. \nThe physico-chemical properties and elemental composition of five peat cores (PdF-I, PdF-II, \nSJC, PI and SV) from four selected mires (Pau de Fruta, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Chapada, Pinheiros and \nSempre Viva) seem to have responded to four main processes: relative accumulation of \norganic and mineral matter, linked to the evolution of the catchment soils (local erosion); \ndeposition of dust from distant/regional sources; preservation of plant remains; and long and \nshort-term peat decomposition. The combination of proxies of PdF-I core defined six main \nphases of change during the Holocene: (I) 10-7.4 cal kyr BP, wet and cold climate and soil \ninstability in the mire catchment; (II) 7.4-4.2 cal kyr BP, wet and warm with catchment soils \nstability and enhanced deposition of regional dusts; (III) 4.2-2.2 cal kyr BP, dry and warm and \na reactivation of soil erosion in the catchment; (IV) 2.2-1.2 cal kyr BP, dry and punctuated \ncooling, with enhanced deposition of regional dusts; (V) 1.2 cal kyr-400 cal yr BP, sub-humid \nclimatic and the lowest inputs of local and regional dust and the largest accumulation of peat \nin the mire; and (VI)&lt;400 cal yr BP, sub-humid conditions but both local and regional \nerosion largely increased. For the late Pleistocene, a combination of proxies applied to the PI \ncore also defined six main phases: (I) 60-39.2 cal kyr BP, from sub-humid to dry amid colder \nconditions than today, and high soil instability in the mire catchment; (II) 39.2-27.8 cal kyr \nBP, dry and warm with cooling events under still high local erosion rates; (III) 27.8-16.4 cal \nkyr BP, wet and very cold with a decreased in soil erosion in the catchment; (IV) 16.4-6.6 cal \nkyr BP, very wet and very cold conditions with low intensity of local erosion; (V) 6.6-3.3 cal \nkyr BP, very dry and warm with increasing rates of local erosion; and (VI)&lt;3.3 cal kyr BP, \nfrom dry and warm to sub-humid climate, with local erosion trend similar to the previous \nperiod. The climate is seen as the most important driving force of environmental change, but \nhuman activities are likely to have been at least partially responsible for the significant \nchanges recorded over the past 400 years. Given the value as environmental archives, mires \nfrom Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional should be fully protected.  \n \nKeywords: Tropical mires; Histosols; Pollen; Geochemistry; Isotopes; Principal components \n\nanalysis  \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n\n Nature writes books about its own history, but in a language we are not directly \n\nfamiliar with and that we need to decipher before the story is revealed. The \n\npalaeoenvironmental reconstruction assists in unraveling this story through the analysis of the \n\nevidence stored in archives, these being the true memory of geosystem (MART\u00cdNEZ \n\nCORTIZAS, 2000). They may be classified as natural (arctic ice and glaciers, ocean and lake \n\nsediments, peatlands, polycyclic soils, etc...) and anthropic archives (archaeological deposits, \n\ncultivated soils, terraces, etc...).   \n\n Peatlands are habitats that have accumulated layers of organic material resulting from \n\nthe imbalance between accumulation/decomposition-mineralization (GORE, 1983), due to \n\nlow oxygen availability associated with prolonged or almost permanent water saturation. \n\nHistosol (SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2010) is their representative soil type. To Clarke and \n\nJoosten (2002), a peatland is an area with or without vegetation with a naturally accumulated \n\npeat layer at the surface, and a mire is a peatland where peat is currently being formed. \n\nSimilarly, Chambers and Charman (2004) used the term \u2018mire\u2019 for areas of active peat \n\naccumulation; in other words, all mires are peatlands, but not all peatland are mires. \n\n In the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, mountain mires are \n\nfound between 1200 and 2000 m a.s.l., over quartzite outcrops of the Espinha\u00e7o Supergroup \n\n(Paleo-Mesoproterozoic), hosting wildlife and flora with unique endemic species and used to \n\nprovide water of good quality for the region's cities. In recent years, they have been studied by \n\nsoil scientists in order to obtain a more detailed knowledge on their properties revealing, \n\nbeyond the overall importance of these ecosystems, their characteristic functions and main \n\nroles, including their value as archive of climate change and atmospheric pollution and \n\nrelation to the dynamics of organic matter (SILVA et al., 2009a, 2009b; HOR\u00c1K, 2009; \n\nHOR\u00c1K et al., 2011; CAMPOS; SILVA; VIDAL-TORRADO, 2012; SILVA, E.V. et al., \n\n2013; SILVA, A.C. et al., 2013).  \n\n The mires, when used for palaeo-research, have several advantages: i) their terrestrial \n\nlocation makes them generally more accessible than ice sheets or oceans; 2) they are more \n\nreadily and economically cored than ice, ocean or lake sediments; 3) they contain a greater \n\nrange of proxies for climate than trees; and 4) their autochthonous mode of production and \n\naccumulation renders them less susceptible to the redeposition that can bedevil some lake-\n\nsediment sequences (CHAMBERS; CHARMAN, 2004).  \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n The ability of most mires to accumulate autochthonous material sequentially, to \n\nsequester carbon for thousands of years, and to contain within them a detailed archive of local \n\nand regional vegetation history, makes them amenable to study environmental and climatic \n\nchanges (BLACKFORD, 1993; CHARMAN, 2002) over the Quaternary. \n\n With this purpose, four mountain mires (Pau de Fruta, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Chapada, Pinheiros \n\nand Sempre Viva) from the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional were selected and five peat cores \n\n(PdF-I, PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV) collected (Figure 1).  \n\n \n Figure 1 - Location of the select peat cores of mountain mires from Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional  \n \n\n In chapter 2 of this thesis, stratigraphy, chronology, characterization of properties \n\n(morphological, physico-chemical, and elemental) and the main processes related to the \n\ngenesis and evolution of these mires are presented, based on the study of the collected cores. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nThis detailed study also helped in the selection of two of the cores to carry out a detailed \n\npalaeoenvironmental reconstruction. We selected the PdF-I core as representative for the \n\nHolocene evolution and the PI core as representative of the Pleisteocene evolution. Chapter 3 \n\ncovers the palaeoenvironmental dynamic of the Holocene (10,000 years BP), by using \n\npalynological and geochemical data of the PdF-I core, combined with stratigraphy, physical \n\nproperties, 14C dating and multivariate statistics. Finally, chapter 4 covers the \n\npalaeoenvironmental dynamic of the Late Pleistocene (60,000 years BP) using the same \n\napproach (except for physical properties), in PI core.  \n\n Therefore, the main objectives of this study were: \n\n - To determine the main constituents and properties of the mires from Serra do \n\nEspinha\u00e7o Meridional, as well as the processes involved in their genesis and evolution. \n\n - To infer the environment and climate dynamic throughout the Holocene determining \n\nthe main changes and their causes at both local and regional scale, by a multi-proxy \n\n(stratigraphy, physical properties, 14C dating, pollen and geochemistry) study of a peat core \n\nsampled in Pau de Fruta mire (PdF-I). \n\n - To infer environment and climate dynamic throughout the late Pleistocene \n\ndetermining the main changes and their causes at both local and regional scale, by a multi-\n\nproxy (stratigraphy, 14C dating, pollen, geochemistry) study of a peat core sampled in \n\nPinheiro mire (PI). \n\n In addition to the knowledge on the past environmental changes, we also expect that \n\nthis study can be of help as a source of information for national and international agencies and \n\nprograms related to the conservation of peatlands, for the protection of this unique ecosystem \n\nin the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional. This must be a priority objective for Quaternary \n\nresearchers, disseminating this knowledge and adding value on the environmental role of \n\npeatlands so that the society claims them as part of their natural and cultural heritage \n\n(MART\u00cdNEZ CORTIZAS, 2000).   \n\nReferences \n\nBLACKFORD, J.J.

In \nparticular, the mountain peatlands from Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional, Minas Gerais State, \nBrazil, provide water of good quality for the nearby cities and also serve as habitats for \nwildlife and flora with unique endemic species. In this paper we present the characterization \nof four mountain mires (Pau de Fruta, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Chapada, Pinheiro and Sempre Viva) from \nthe Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional, based on morphological, physico-chemical, and elemental \nproperties analyzed in five selected peat cores (PdF-I, PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV), which are \ncompared with those of peatlands from other mountainous areas of tropical and temperate \nregions. Radiocarbon dating indicates that they started to form during the late Pleistocene. \nPrincipal components analysis was applied to synthesize the main peat properties and identify \nthe underlying processes. The first principal component, PC1, is related to the relative content \nin inorganic versus organic matter of the peat, most probably related to the evolution of the \nsoils of the mires' catchments (i.e. soil erosion); PC2 seems to be related to the incorporation \nof inorganic material by deposition of dust from regional sources; PC3 reflects the content \nand preservation of plant remains (fibre content); and PC4 indicates the degree of peat \ndecomposition. Our results suggest that tropical mountain mires from Serra do Espinha\u00e7o \nMeridional are complex peatland ecosytems, with a large potential for the reconstruction of \nenvironmental changes (i.e. climate change) occurred since the late Pleistocene, and that they \nshould be fully protected. \n\nKeywords: Tropical peatlands; Histosols; Peat properties; Principal components analysis \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\n Peatlands are an important type of wetlands accounting for 50-70% of the global \n\nwetlands area (CLYMO, 1984; GORHAM, 1991), and occupying 5-8% of the Earth's land \n\nsurface (INTERNATIONAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE - IPCC, 2010). The high \n\ncarbon content is one of the characteristics of these ecosystems, being the Histosol (SOIL \n\nSURVEY STAFF, 2010) their representative soil type, and resulting from the imbalance \n\nbetween accumulation/decomposition-mineralization of organic matter (GORE, 1983), due to \n\nlow oxygen availability associated with prolonged or almost permanent water saturation. \n\n Large extensions are found in temperate and boreal areas, but tropical peatlands are \n\nalso important contributing 10-12% (31-46 million hectares) to the global peatlands area \n\n(IMMIRZI; MALTBY; CLYMO, 1992; RIELEY; AHMAD-SHAH; BRADY, 1996) and \n\nbeing considered as environmental and ecological systems with intrinsic properties \n\n(BARBIER, 1994; PAGE; RIELEY, 1998). High cover of tropical peatlands is found in \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n\nSoutheastern Asia with 56%, followed by South America with 24%, a 6% occurring in Brazil \n\n(PAGE; RIELEY; BANKS, 2011).  \n\n The restricted knowledge regarding to important aspects afforded by these tropical \n\necosystems has led to growing losses, poor preservation, and reduced ecological functions, \n\nmainly by inadequate management practices. In Southeastern Asia, episodes of drought \n\nassociated with the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were observed in combination with \n\nforest degradation and changes of land use activities (PAGE; RIELEY; W\u00dcST, 2006), which \n\ntriggered the spread of fires in peatlands (PAGE et al., 2002) and produced high levels of air \n\npollution (SCHWEITHELM, 1999). The huge release of the stored carbon, in the form of \n\ngreenhouse gases, which are a major contributor to climate change (MURDIYARSO; \n\nHERGOUALC'H; VERCHOT, 2010), is also of wide concern. Therefore, more efforts should \n\nbe made to better understand and disseminate the ecological value of peatlands. \n\n According to Chimner and Karberg (2008) tropical peatlands are located at least in \n\ntwo distinctive altitudinal zones, below 30 m a.s.l., known as low altitude peatlands, and \n\nabove 1200 m a.s.l., known as mountain peatlands; the second only found in South America, \n\nAfrica and Papua New Guinea (PAGE; RIELEY; BANKS, 2011). In the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o \n\nMeridional (Minas Gerais State, Brazil), mountain peatlands are found between 1200 and \n\n2000 m a.s.l. over quartzite outcrops of the Espinha\u00e7o Supergroup, hosting wildlife and flora \n\nwith unique endemic species and being used to provide water of good quality for the region's \n\ncities. In recent years, these peatlands have been studied by soil scientists in order to obtain a \n\nmore detailed knowledge on their properties revealing, beyond the overall importance of these \n\necosystems, their characteristic functions and main roles, including their use as archive of \n\nclimate changes and atmospheric pollution and the relationship to the dynamics of organic \n\nmatter. The main objectives of the investigations already undertaken focused on the general \n\ncharacterization of the peat properties (physical, chemical, morphological and biological) \n\nfrom three peatlands -Biribiri, Itamb\u00e9 and Pau de Fruta (SILVA et al., 2009a), the \n\ncharacterization of humic substances of the same peatlands (SILVA et al., 2009b), mapping \n\nand determining the stock of organic matter and water volume (CAMPOS; SILVA; VIDAL-\n\nTORRADO, 2012), reconstructing Holocene palaeoenvironmental change (HOR\u00c1K, 2009; \n\nHOR\u00c1K et al., 2011) and the determination of total biomass (SILVA, E.V. et al., 2013) and \n\ndegree of peat humification (SILVA, A.C et al., 2013), the latter only in one peatland (Pau de \n\nFruta).  \n\n In the European Union, peatlands are protected by the instruction directive from 1992 \n\n(B\u00c9LGICA, 1992), and some countries, like Spain, have their own protection regulations \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n(PONTEVEDRA POMBAL; MART\u00cdNEZ CORTIZAS, 2004). The situation is quite different \n\nfor tropical peatlands. In Brazil, there are no regulations and specific planning for the \n\nappropriate use of peatlands; the importance of conservation is only loosely mentioned in the \n\ndecree of the Convention on Wetlands (BRASIL, 1996). In 2005, the United Nations \n\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized the Serra do \n\nEspinha\u00e7o as the seventh Brazilian Biosphere Reserve due to the high diversity of natural \n\nresources, but with any particular mention to the peatlands of this region. At present, it \n\nremains a challenge to involve as many trained scientist as possible in the study of tropical \n\npeatlands ecosystems to provide the basic knowledge needed for better conservation, \n\nprotection and management strategies. \n\n In this study we present a characterization based on morphological, physico-chemical, \n\nand elemental properties of mountain mires from the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional. The \n\nresults obtained were compared with those of peatlands from other mountainous areas of \n\ntropical and temperate regions. Multivariate statistical methods (principal components \n\nanalysis) applied to the physico-chemical properties was used to assist in the identification of \n\nprocesses/drivers that control the nature of the studied mires. Stratigraphy and chronology \n\ncomplement contextualize the main changes recorded. Beyond a scientific contribution, we \n\nalso expect that this research may serve as a source useful for national and international \n\nagencies and programs related to the conservation of peatlands, to propose the protection of \n\nthis unique ecosystem in the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional.  \n\n \n\n2.2 Material and Methods \n\n2.2.1 Study area \n\n Five cores were collected in four mires located in Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional \n\n(Minas Gerais State, Brazil): core PdF-I (18\u00ba15\u201927,08\u201d S 43\u00ba40\u20193,64\u201d W) with 438 cm in \n\nlength and core PdF-II (18\u00b016'14.45\" S 43\u00b040'59.5\" W) with 264 cm, were collected in Pau de \n\nFruta mire, located at 1350 m and 1360 m a.s.l., respectively; core SJC, 378 cm, in S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o \n\nda Chapada mire (18\u00b05'40.47\" S 43\u00b047'16.27\" W) at 1342 m a.s.l.; core PI, 324 cm, in \n\nPinheiro mire (18\u00b03'44.42\" S 43\u00b039'42.37\" W) at 1242 m a.s.l.; and core SV, 162 cm, in \n\nSempre-Viva mire (17\u00b054'45.4\" S 43\u00b047'29.52\" W) at 1260 m a.s.l (Figure 1D). Sampling \n\nwas done between 2008 and 2010 using a vibracore (MARTIN; FLEXOR; SUGUIO, 1995). \n\nThe stratigraphy of each core was described according to Guidelines for Soil Descriptions \n\n(FAO, 2006) and Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils (SCHOENEBERGER et al.,  \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 - Location of tropical and temperate mountain mires mentioned in this study. (A) Brazil and Northwest \n\nIberian Peninsula; (B) temperate mountain mires from Galicia (Spain) (Pontevedra-Pombal, 2002; \nPontevedra-Pombal et al., 2006) and other from Northwest Iberian Peninsula (Aira and Guiti\u00e1n, \n1986a, b; Molinero et al., 1984; Ramil and Aira Rodriguez, 1993; Ramil et al., 1994; Torras, 1982); \n(C) tropical mountain mires from Southeastern and Southern Brazilian States and Federative Unit \n(Central region) (Valladares, 2003); (D) tropical mountain mires from Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional \n(Minas Gerais State, Brazil), where PdF-I, PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV belong to this study, while P1, P2 \nand P4 after Silva et al. (2009a, 2009b) \n\n2012), whereas the horizons/layers were defined according to Soil Taxonomy (SOIL \n\nSURVEY STAFF, 2010). \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n According to the classification system proposed by Lindsay (1995), the mires of this \n\nstudy are minerogenic, valley mires and present the following main characteristics: water \n\ntable at or just below the surface; waters originating from mineral soils (minerotrophic); \n\ndominant slightly acidic to neutral peat materials; moderately to well decomposed; and sedge \n\nand/or brown moss peat (NATIONAL WETLANDS WORKING GROUP, 1988). \n\n The basal lithology of the Pau de Fruta mire is the Sopa-Brumadinho formation and of \n\nthe S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Chapada mire is the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Chapada formation, both corresponding to \n\nthe Guinda group, composed mostly by quartzites, but also green schists and hematitic \n\nphylites. Pinheiro and Sempre Viva mires correspond to the Galho do Miguel formation, \n\nconstituted by pure and thin quartzites (90%) and thin micaceous quartzites and gray or \n\ngreenish metargilites (5-10%) (KNAUER, 2007). All these formations have ages dating from \n\nthe Paleo-Mesoproterozoic.  \n\n Present climate has been characterized as tropical mountainous, according to K\u00f6ppen \n\nclassification, with an average annual precipitation of 1500 mm (NIMER, 1977).  \n\n Vegetation is typical of Cerrado biome (savanna), one of the most endangered in the \n\nworld, but also contains a mosaic of patches of forests (semi-deciduous forest and Cerrad\u00e3o) \n\ncalled \"Cap\u00f5es\", which appear as a small island dispersed among grassland formations (wet \n\ngrassland: Campo Limpo \u00damido, dry grassland: Campo Limpo Seco, and rupicola-saxicolous \n\ngrassland: Campo Rupestre) within the mire. Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Clusiaceae and \n\nRubiaceae are the predominat families in the \"Cap\u00f5es\", while Poaceae, Cyperaceae, \n\nDroseraceae, Xyridaceae, Eriocaulaceae, Gentianaceae, Lentibulariaceae and Bromeliaceae in \n\nthe grasslands. Moreover, Amaranthaceae, Clusiaceae, Caryocaraceae, Annonaceae, \n\nLithraceae, Vochysiaceae and Leguminosae are often found between these two formations.  \n\n2.2.2 Analytical determinations \n\n2.2.2.1. Physico-chemical and morphological properties \n\n According to the characterization tests of Histosols (LYNN; MCKINZIE; \n\nGROSSMAN, 1974) described by Embrapa (2013), unrubbed (URF) and rubbed fibres (RF), \n\npH in CaCl2, peat bulk density (BD), peat density without inorganic matter (BDO), \n\ngravimetric moisture (GM), minimum residue (MR) and mineral material content (MM) were \n\ndetermined, as well as the von Post scale (VP) to assess the degree of peat decomposition \n\n(STANEK; SILC, 1977). Wet samples of 10 cm in thickness of PdF-I and of 4 cm in \n\nthickness of PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV were used.   \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n\n2.2.2.2 Elemental composition \n\n Elemental concentrations were determined in dried, milled and homogenized samples \n\nof 10 cm in thickness in PdF-I core and samples of 2 cm in thickness in the other cores (PdF-\n\nII, SJC, PI and SV). Carbon and N contents of PdF-I were determined by an elemental \n\nanalyzer coupled to a mass spectrometer, hosted in the Laborat\u00f3rio de Is\u00f3topos Est\u00e1veis of the \n\nCentro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura - CENA/USP (Piracicaba, SP, Brasil), while for \n\ncores PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV we used an elemental analyzer coupled to a mass spectrometer \n\nhosted in the Laborat\u00f3rio de Ecologia Isot\u00f3pica of the Centro de Energia Nuclear na \n\nAgricultura - CENA/USP (Piracicaba, SP, Brasil). Silicon, Al, Ti and Zr concentrations were \n\ndetermined by X-ray fluorescence using two energy dispersive XRF analyzers \n\n(CHEBURKIN; SHOTYK, 1996; WEISS; CHEBURKIN; SHOTYK, 1998) hosted at the \n\nRIAIDT facility (Infrastructure Network for the Support of Research and Technological \n\nDevelopment) of the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), which were calibrated \n\nusing certified reference materials (NIST 1515, 1541, 1547 and 1575, BCR 60 and 62 and V-\n\n1). Detection limits for organic matrices were:&lt;0.01% for Al and Si; 0.0005% for Ti; and 1 \n\n?g g-1 for Zr; the detection limits for mineral matrices were: 0.1% for Al; 0.05% for Si; \n\n0.002% for Ti; and 1 ?g g-1 for Zr. \n\n2.2.2.3 Chronology  \n\n Forty five selected peat samples (11 in PdF-I, 7 in PdF-II, 8 in SJC, 13 in PI and 6 in \n\nSV) were radiocarbon dated by AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) in the Beta Analytic \n\nInc. (Miami, USA) and AMS Laboratory of Georgia University (UGAMS, USA). Moreover, \n\neight samples of mineral sediments (1 in PdF-II, 2 in SJC, 3 in PI and 2 in SV) were dated by \n\nOSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) in the Laborat\u00f3rio de Vidros e Data\u00e7\u00e3o of FATEC \n\n- Labvidro (S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brasil). The radiocarbon results were calibrated using CALIB 7.0 \n\nsoftware.  \n\n2.2.3 Statistical analysis \n\n Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the data matrices of the \n\nphysico-chemical and elemental properties of the peat samples; Von Post data (VP) were not \n\nincluded, because it is a field test and has a qualitative significance. PCA enables an intuitive \n\ninterpretation from a pedological point of view, each component providing a meaning in \n\nterms of the main factors and processes responsible for peat properties. The data were log-\n\ntransformed (except pH, C/N, MM, URF, RF, BD and BDO) and standardized before \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nanalysis, as suggested for compositional data (i.e close data sets) (REIMANN et al., 2008). \n\nThe PCA was performed, using SPSS 20.0 software, in the correlation mode and the varimax \n\nrotation was applied to maximize the loadings of the variables in the components \n\n(ERIKSSON et al., 1999).  \n\n2.2.4 Properties of other mountain mires  \n\n Data of mountain mires were compiled for other tropical and temperate areas (Figure \n\n1) to compare with those from the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional. The choice was done \n\ndepending on data availability. \n\n Regarding to the tropical mountain mires, we used data of other mires from the Serra \n\ndo Espinha\u00e7o Meridional, differentiated into minerogenic (P1 and P4) and ombrogenic (P2) \n\n(SILVA et al., 2009a,b) (Figure 1D), and from other Brazilian States in the southeast and \n\nsouth, including Minas Gerais (MG1 and MG2), Rio de Janeiro (RJ1 and RJ4), S\u00e3o Paulo \n\n(SP1), Paran\u00e1 (PR2 and PR3) and Rio Grande do Sul (RS3), and the Federative Unit Distrito \n\nFederal (DF1) (Figure 1C; VALLADARES, 2003). In the following discussion, the mires \n\nfrom Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional are referred as TRE (tropical Espinha\u00e7o), TRE-m for \n\nminerogenic and TRE-o for ombrogenic, and mires from other Brazilian States and Federative \n\nUnit as TRS (tropical States).  \n\n For the temperate mountain mires, data of mires from Galicia (NW Spain; Figure 1B) \n\nwere used, being also differentiated into minerogenic (BLA, CPD, BPA, BAG and PLM) and \n\nombrogenic mires (PVO, PDC and CAD) (PONTEVEDRA-POMBAL, 2002; \n\nPONTEVEDRA-POMBAL et al., 2006). Other mountain mire from the Northwest of the \n\nIberian Peninsula (AGN, BUI, CDL, LUZ, MII, PNV and PZC) (AIRA; GUITI\u00c1N, 1986a, \n\n1986b; MOLINERO; POLO; DORADO, 1984; RAMIL; AIRA RODRIGUEZ, 1993; \n\nRAMIL; AIRA RODR\u00cdGUEZ; TABOADA, 1994; TORRAS, 1982) were also used. In the \n\ntext, TEG (temperate Galicia) abbreviation was used for the mires studied by Pontevedra-\n\nPombal (2002) and Pontevedra-Pombal et al. (2006), being divided into TEG-m for \n\nminerogenic and TEG-o for ombrogenic mires; while TEI (temperate Iberian) is used for \n\nthose studied by the other authors cited above. \n\n2.3 Results \n\n2.3.1 Stratigraphy \n\n The stratigraphy of PdF-I, PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV cores is shown in Figure 2. The \n\nhorizons/layers are differentiated based on the main morphological features, taking into  \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2 - Stratigraphy of the studied cores, sampled in mires from Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional (Minas Gerais, \n\nBrazil) \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\naccount the degree of peat decomposition and consistency of the organic matter, texture of the \n\nmineral constituents and features preserved.  \n\n Mineral sediments are the main constituents of the bottom layers, except in SV in \n\nwhich the sediment was not reached during coring. The sediments are composed of quartzitic \n\nsands in all cases, with varying proportions of coarse, medium and fine sand grain size; they \n\nalso differ in the presence of Fe coatings/precipitates, relative abundance of mica and woody \n\nfragments.  \n\n The peat deposits are dominated by sapric horizons (Oa) in all cores, although strongly \n\ndecomposed peat is found at discrete depths: 278-298 cm, 158-202 cm, 125-138 cm, and 113-\n\n118 cm in PdF-I; 137-159 cm in PdF-II; 287-294 cm, 262-273 cm, 234-254 cm, 173-201 cm \n\nin SJC; 212-220 cm, 192-198 cm, 136-157 cm, 10-58 cm in PI; and 44-75 cm in SV (Fig. 2). \n\nHemic (Oe), hemic-fibric (Oe-i), and fibric-hemic (Oi-e) horizons were only found in PdF-I \n\nand PdF-II. The uppermost section of all cores is represented by fibric peat (58 cm in PdF-I, \n\n18 cm in PdF-II, 12 cm in SJC, 10 cm in PI, and 14 cm in SV).  \n\n Some peat horizons also contain large amounts of mineral matter, particularly in \n\nsections closer to the mineral substratum. Sandy peat horizons were found in PdF-I (in Oa7), \n\nPdF-II (Oa4), SJC (Oa5 and Oa3), PI (Oa6) and SV (Oa6 to Oa3). Peat horizons with finer \n\ngrain size mineral matter were also found in SJC (Oa13 to Oa10) and PI (Oa7 and Oa5). \n\nCharcoal was only found in PdF-I (Oa7 to Oa2, Fig. 2). \n\n2.3.2 Physico-chemical, morphological and elemental properties  \n\n In the text that follows, minimum, maximum and average values of properties are \n\nmentioned, considering the whole population of samples analyzed. The vertical distribution of \n\nthese properties can be seen in APPENDICES A-I, and average values for each property by \n\nhorizon/layer are in table 1.   \n\n2.3.2.1 Soil reaction  \n\n pH ranges between 2.7-5.1 and the average is 3.8\u00b10.5, indicating strongly acidic to \n\nacidic conditions (APPENDIX A). In PdF-II, SJC and SV, the pH decreases from the base to \n\n158 cm, 22 cm and 66 cm, respectively, with a subsequent increase to the surface. The PdF-I \n\nand PI cores shows a pH decrease from the base to 268 cm and 122 cm, respectively, followed \n\nby an increase to 35 to 58 cm, and a decrease to the surface (APPENDIX A) \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nTable 1 -

In PdF-I, SJC and SV, a pronounced decrease after the first upward trend from \n\nthe base occurs at 167 cm, 146 cm and 106 cm, respectively, with subsequent recovery to the \n\nsurface. In PdF-II (162-154 cm) and PI (218-214 cm) clear changes are observed in the boundary \n\nbetween the mineral sediments and the peat; values being lower and constant in the sediments \n\nwhile values are higher in the peat deposit.  \n\n Peat bulk density (BD) values vary between 0.06-1.5 Mg m-3 with an average of 0.5\u00b10.4 \n\nMg m-3, and peat density without inorganic matter (BDO) between 0.02-0.3 Mg m-3 with an \n\naverage of 0.14\u00b10.06 Mg m-3. General trends (APPENDIX C_A) are observed for BD, the values \n\ndecreasing from the base to the surface, with some smaller variations. For BDO (APPENDIX \n\nC_B), increasing values until 158 cm, 90 cm, 90 cm and 82 cm in PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV, \n\nrespectively, are followed by a decrease to the surface. In PdF-I, BDO varies little with only two \n\npeaks at around 60 cm and 247 cm. \n\n2.3.2.3 Mineral matter and minimum residue  \n\n The mineral matter (MM) contents are between 6-99.8% with an average of 58\u00b129%, and \n\nminimum residue (MR) varies between 0.003-0.9 m m-1 with an average of 0.27\u00b10.29 m m-1. In \n\nall cores both properties show decreasing trends from the base to surface (APPENDICES D_A \n\nand D_B). Moreover, they show identical changes in the same core, i.e., all relative changes of \n\nthese properties occur at the same depths, but MM changes are more pronounced than RM ones. \n\nMM, MR and BD have similar trends, and opposite to GM.  \n\n2.3.2.4 Unrubbed and rubbed fibres, degree of peat decomposition and Von Post scale \n\n Unrubbed fibres (URF) were between 0-72% with an average of 16\u00b115% and rubbed \n\nfibres (RF) between 0-56% with an average of 5\u00b17%. Similar variations are observed for these \n\ntwo properties in the cores PdF-II and SJC (APPENDICES E_A and E_B): PdF-II has higher \n\ncontents at 162-110 cm, 66-42 cm and 26-6 cm, and SJC has irregular trends increasing from the \n\nbase to 118 cm followed by a reduction and again an increase in the upper 18 cm. As for PdF-I, \n\nPI and SV, some sections show high contents of URF and almost absence of RF, as observed at \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n388-197 cm in PdF-I, 150-106 cm in PI and 158-114 cm in SV; high values for both properties in \n\nthese cores are seen at the depths 117-0 cm in PdF-I, 74-10 cm in PI and 18-6 cm in SV.  \n\n The von Post degree of peat decomposition varies between classes 3 and 10 (APPENDIX \n\nF), therefore, the three stages of decomposition, fibric (3 and 4), hemic (5 and 6), and sapric (7 to \n\n10) were found (as already described in the stratigraphies). Cores PdF-I, PdF-II, SJC and PI have \n\ngeneral trends of decreasing peat decomposition from the base to surface. In SV it increases from \n\nthe base to around 30 cm followed by an abrupt decrease to the surface.  \n\n2.3.2.5 Organic and inorganic elemental composition \n\n Carbon content varies between 0.03 and 54% with an average of 21\u00b114% and N between \n\n0.002 and 2.3% with an average of 0.6\u00b10.6%. With the exception of the, expected, low content in \n\nthe sediments, C contents show a general increase from the base of the top of the cores \n\n(APPENDIX G_A), although significant variations are found at different depths with local \n\nminima and maxima. In PdF-I, PdF-II and SV a more or less pronounced decrease in C content \n\noccurs in the upper 50-60 cm; while no such variation is observed in cores SJC and PI. \n\n Nitrogen contents also increase from the base to the surface of the cores (APPENDIX \n\nG_B); with a reversing trend in the upper tens of centimeters in cores PdF-II and SJC. Although \n\nsmaller local minima/maxima are also found, they are of much lower variation than those \n\nobserved for C.  \n\n The C/N ratios vary between 12 and 92 with an average of 44\u00b118. The large values found \n\nin the sediments are unreliable since the low amounts of organic matter resulted in N contents \n\nclose to the detection limit. In agreement with what is observed for the C and N records, the C/N \n\nratios show little or a slight decrease in the most part of the subsuperficial peat sections \n\n(APPENDIX H), followed by a pronounced decrease to the surface. The only exception is the \n\nPdF-I core, in which a general decreasing trend in C/N ratios is observed. \n\n Concentrations of Si are between 0.6-45% with an average of 13\u00b114% (APPENDIX I_A), \n\nAl between 0.2-18% with an average of 5\u00b14% (APPENDIX I_B), Ti between 0.01-2% with an \n\naverage of 0.3\u00b10.3% (APPENDIX I_C) and Zr between 3-545 ?g g-1 with average of 170\u00b1110 ?g \n\ng-1 (APPENDIX I_D). The highest concentrations of Si correspond to the basal sediments (Fig. \n\n10A), but relative increases were also found in some horizons, particularly in the sapric peat \n\nhorizons with visible presence of sands, silt and clay (described above). In general, Si does not \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n\ncorrelate, or the correlation is negative, with the other lithogenic elements analysed (r2:  -0.208 \n\nwith Al, -0.043 with Ti, -0.003 with Zr), which have quite similar distributions in each core (r2 \n\nAl-Ti: 0.76; r2 Al-Zr: 0.68; r2 Ti-Zr: 0.57). \n\n2.3.3 Chronology  \n\n The ages of the PdF-I core cover the entire Holocene, whereas PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV \n\nstarted to form in the late Pleistocene, including the mineral sediments (Table 2).

Strikingly, in all cores dating back to the \n\nPleistocene there are pervasive age inversions below the maximum (below 161 cm in PdF-II, 309 \n\ncm in SJC, 101 cm in PI and 119 cm in SV). The PI core is a paradigmatic example, since ages \n\nuntil 101 cm indicate a consitent linear peat accumulation (depth-age r2 0.99, 0.38 mm yr-1, i.e. \n\n261 yr cm-1), which extrapolated suggests a basal peat age of 55 kyr, when all ages below 101 are \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n\nmuch younger than 25 kyr. Although rejuvenation by roots or other sources of younger organic \n\nmatter should be considered, we do not know the reason why all investigated mires are affected. \n\nSimilar situations were found in Pleistocene layers of other peat deposits from the Southern \n\nHemisphere (WEISS et al., 2002; MARGALEF et al., 2013). VOELKER et al. (2000) found \n\nhighly increased concentrations of 14C for the period 27 to 54 ka, coincided with low \n\npaleomagnetic filed intensities. An alternative explanation could be a relationship to methane \n\nformation, since it has a very low ?13C value (~-60\u2030; CHARMAN et al., 1999) making the \n\nremaining material (peat) enriched in 13C and 14C contents (Peter Buurman, personal \n\ncommunication). With these limitations in mind, long-term accumulation rates were calculated \n\nwith the ages that showed a consitent trend. The PdF-I core showed the largest rate (4.0 mm yr-1), \n\nfollowed by PdF-II and SJC (0.6-0.7 mm yr-1), while the lowest accumulation rates were found in \n\nPI and SV (0.34-0.38 mm yr-1).  \n\n2.3.4 Principal components analysis (PCA) \n\n Four principal components were extracted accounting for 86% of the total variance of the \n\ndataset (Table 3). The von Post degree of peat decomposition has not been included due to its \n\nqualitative, non-continuous nature. The first component (PC1) explains 45% of the variance and \n\nshows large positive loadings (0.88-0.96) for MR, BD, MM, and Si, a moderate positive loading \n\n(0.49) for pH and large negative loadings (-0.95) for C, N and GM, thus reflecting and opposition \n\nbetween mineral and organic matter content. The second component (PC2) explains 18% of the \n\nvariance, showing positive loadings for Ti, Al and Zr, also lithogenic elements tracers of mineral \n\nmatter content. The third component (PC3) explains 12% of the variance and shows positive \n\nloadings for RF and URF, the content in fibres of the peat. And the fourth component (PC4) \n\nexplains 11% of the variance, and shows positive loadings for C/N ratio and BDO. \n\n Most of the elements/properties analyzed here are correctly explained by the four \n\nprincipal components extracted (total length of the bar in Figure 3), with the only exception of pH \n\n\u2013for which the total variance explained is rather low (32%). Also, most of them are associated to \n\nonly one component (MR, GM, BD, C, N, MM, Si, Ti, Al, RF, C/N ratios) and can be considered \n\nas good proxies for the underlying processes. Zirconium, URF and BDO also have some variance \n\nallocated to at least another secondary process. Though von Post degree of the decomposition of \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nthe peat has not been explained by PCA (not included) it may be associated with the C/N ratio \n\nand BDO, therefore with PC4. \nTable 3 - Factor loadings for the four components extracted by PCA using the physico-chemical properties and \n\nelemental composition of the peat of the studied cores of mires from Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional (PdF-\nI, PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV) \n\n \nPC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 \n\n 1MR 0.96 0.08 -0.17 -0.09 \n2GM -0.95 -0.10 0.16 0.03 \n3BD 0.95 0.12 -0.18 0.04 \nN -0.95 -0.11 0.18 -0.01 \nC -0.95 -0.03 0.13 0.20 \n\n4MM 0.90 0.23 -0.24 0.07 \nSi 0.88 0.02 -0.12 -0.21 \npH 0.49 0.28 -0.02 0.07 \nTi 0.06 0.93 -0.05 0.11 \nAl 0.07 0.92 -0.06 0.05 \nZr 0.35 0.83 -0.07 0.27 \n\n5RF -0.20 -0.02 0.91 -0.16 \n6URF -0.31 -0.14 0.86 0.11 \n7C/N 0.09 0.14 -0.09 0.92 \n\n8BDO -0.37 0.23 0.04 0.75 \n9Eigv 6.8 2.7 1.8 1.6 \n\n10Var (%) 45 18 12 11 \n11Var_ac 45 63 75 86 \n\n1MR: minimum residue; 2GM: gravimetric moisture; 3BD: bulk density; 4MM: mineral material content; 5RF: rubbed \nfibres; 6URF: unrubbed fibres; 7C/N: C/N ratio; 8BDO: bulk density of the organic matter; 9Eigv: eigenvalues; 10Var \n(%): percentage of variance; 11Var_ac: cumulative explained variance \n\n2.4 Discussion \n\n The analyzed properties have to be conceived as proxies of the processes/drivers that \n\ncontrol the nature of the studied mires. Thus, each principal component has to be envisaged as an \n\nassociation of physico-chemical proxies related to an underlying factor. The interpretation and \n\ndiscussion of each component is given below. \n\n2.4.1 Inorganic matter versus organic matter content of the peat \n\n Most of the properties with positive loadings of PC1 are related to the mineral matter \n\ncontent (MR, BD, MM, and Si), while the elements (C and N are biophyllic elements) and \n\nproperties (GM, water content) with negatives loadings are related to the organic matter content \n\n(Table 3). The opposite loadings indicate that as the content of mineral matter of the peat  \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 - Fractionation of the communalities of the variables used in the PCA. The communality of each variable \n\n(i.e. the proportion of its variance explained by each component) corresponds to the total length of the bar; \nthe sections of the bars represent the proportion of variance in each principal component. The variables are \nordered by the component with the largest share of variance. Black: PC1, dark grey: PC2, light grey: PC3, \nwhite: PC4 \n\n \nincreases its content of organic matter decreases (i.e. a dilution effect). Silicon is related to this \n\ncomponent because it is most probably reflecting the amount of quartz transported from the \n\ncatchment soils to the mire, since the main geological material is quartzite, which is certainly the \n\nmain source of MM and thus PC1 represents a local erosion signal.  \n\n The Si concentrations determined (0.6-45%; APPENDIX I_A) have minima which are \n\nlower than those observed in ombrogenic mires of the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o (TRE-o, 7-47%), and \n\nombrogenic and minerogenic mires from temperate areas (TEG-o, 2-11%; TEG-m, 4-50%), and \n\nmaxima comparable with those of ombrogenic mires of Serra do Espinha\u00e7o (TRE-o) and \n\ntemperate minerogenic mires (TEG-m). Meanwhile, MM (6-99.8%; APPENDIX D_A) has \n\nvalues closer to those of minerogenic mires of Serra do Espinha\u00e7o (TRE-m, 16-98%) than to the \n\nTRE-o (2-34%), and comparable to those of TEG-o (2-99.4%) and TEG-m (1.4-99.3%). Mires \n\nfrom the Tropical States (TRS) have minima higher and maxima somewhat lower (63-81% in \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nDF, 33-79% in MG, 19-72% in PR, 81-91% in RJ, 55-82% in RS and 61-69% in SP) and mires \n\nfrom temperate Iberia (TEI) have very low maxima (4-19%) despite of comparable minima.  \n\n Minimum residue (MR) is an estimation of the original proportion of MM (similar \n\ntrends); MR (0.003-0.9 m m-1; APPENDIX D_B) values are closer to those of TRE-o (0.5-1.3 m \n\nm-1) than TRE-m (5-90 m m-1), and have lower minima and higher maxima than TRS (0.2-0.4 m \n\nm-1 in DF, 0.1-0.2 m m-1 in MG, 0.02-0.3 m m-1 in PR, 0.3-0.6 m m-1 in RJ, 0.04-0.3 m m-1 in RS \n\nand 0.2-0.3 m m-1 in SP). Peat bulk density (BD; 0.06-1.4 Mg m-3; APPENDIX C_A) increases \n\nsimultaneously with increasing MR, therefore also with MM and Si, because the inorganic matter \n\nhas a higher density than the organic matter. Peat bulk density values are more similar to those of \n\nTRE-m (0.3-1.4 Mg m-3) than TRE-o (0.3-0.4 Mg m-3), and also to TEG-o and TEG-m (0.1-1.5 \n\nMg m-3); regarding to TRS (0.4-0.8 Mg m-3 in DF, 0.2-0.4 Mg m-3 in MG, 0.1-0.7 Mg m-3 in PR, \n\n0.5-1.0 Mg m-3 in RJ, 0.1-0.5 Mg m-3 in RS and 0.6 Mg m-3 average in SP) these have higher \n\nminima and lower maxima, and in relation to TEI (0.04-0.3 Mg m-3) the minima are comparable \n\nwhereas the maxima are lower. Peat bulk density can also increase down in the peat deposits due \n\nto compression and structural collapse of the peat, but in the studied cores almost all the BD \n\nvariance is allocated to the first component, indicating that the content of mineral matter is the \n\nmost important driver.  \n\n As indicated above, pH has the lowest proportion of total explained variance (24%; Figure \n\n3), but most of what is explained is associated to PC1, due to the fact that the pH of the sediment \n\nlayers tends to be higher than those of the peat. The minimum value (2.7; APPENDIX A) is \n\ncomparables to TRE-o mires (2.7-2.9) and maximum (4.5) to TRE-m (3.8-4.5). Moreover, these \n\nvalues resemble those of TEG-o (2.0-3.9) and TEG-m (2.3-5.0). Concerning to TRS, in general \n\nthe minimum is higher and the maximum comparable (4.1-5.3 in DF, 3.9-4.6 in MG, 3.4-4.2 in \n\nPR, 3.8-4.9 in RJ, 3.7-3.9 in RS and 4.0-4.4 in SP), as well as for TEI (3.2-4.9).  \n\n The biophyllic elements C and N show negative loadings because they depend on the total \n\norganic matter content, the most important contributor to the composition of peat. While the \n\nnegative loading of GM indicates that water content is higher in peat sections than in mineral \n\nsections. According to Andriesse (1988) and Galv\u00e3o and Vahl (1996), the accumulation of \n\norganic matter is directly influenced by the nature of the organic material. Mineral matter \n\nproduces a relative dilution of the organic matter content of the peat and, in addition, effective \n\nprocesses of nutrient cycling (including immobilization and mineralization) and decomposition of \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n\norganic matter result in a further decrease of the organic matter content. Total carbon values \n\n(0.03-54%; APPENDIX G_A) are consistent with those obtained in TRE-m (8-49%) and TEG-m \n\n(0.14-54%). The TRE-o (40-52%) and TEG-o (17-56%) have minima similar to those of TRS \n\n(10-20% in DF, 12-37% in MG, 14-42% in PR, 4-10% in RJ, 7-16% in RS and 14-21% in SP) \n\ndespite these have also higher maxima, and TEI (14-60%). The lower N (0.002-2%; APPENDIX \n\nG_B) contents are similar to those of TEG-m (0.01-3); while maxima are more in accordance to \n\nTRE-o (1-2%), TRE-m (0.2-2.1%), TEG-o (0.5-2%) and TEI (0.1-2%). According to Silva et al. \n\n(2004), low N contents in deeper sections are probably associated to longer interaction of organic \n\ncompounds with soil biota, beyond to chemical reactions with the soil solution.  \n\n As can be seen in Figure 4, the changes in PC1 scores show general decreasing trends \n\nfrom the base to the surface, with more positive scores for the sediment layers with predominance \n\nof mineral material and more negative for the peat horizons. However, each core has \n\ncharacteristic patterns of distribution. In PdF-I, the first organic rich sediment horizon (388-298 \n\ncm; Figure 2) is reflected by a decrease in PC1 scores, although the positive values still indicate \n\nthe peat has large contents of mineral matter (APPENDIX D_A) compared to the organic matter \n\n(average C content 6%; APPENDIX G_A). From 298 to 207 cm, the scores continue to decrease \n\nto negative values pointing to an increase in organic matter content. Around 207 cm the scores \n\nincrease again to moderate positive values until 158 cm, therefore indicating increasing mineral \n\nmatter (70-91% of MM; 20-5% of C). After that scores decrease sharply to remain stable, at \n\nminimum values, until 60 cm; being this section the one with the largest C contents (19-40%). \n\nThe upper 60 cm show higher, but still negative, almost constant scores. \n\n The most positive PC1 scores in PdF-II are seen again in the basal sediment (202-158 cm; \n\nFigure 2). At 158 cm, the abrupt decrease in PC1 scores indicates the start of peat accumulation, \n\nshowing the rest of the core negative values with much smaller variations. Local peaks are found \n\nat 158-130 cm, 106-98 cm, 82-54 cm and 34-22 cm. \n\n At 302-230 cm in SJC, PC1 scores decrease steadily from positive to negative values, \n\npointing to an increase in the organic matter content; however, at 258 cm and between 170 to 118 \n\ncm there is a series of peaks in scores (higher mineral matter content) pointing to fluxes of \n\nmineral matter from the catchment (probably linked to soil erosion). Around 118 cm the scores \n\ndecrease continuously to high negative values until 18 cm, being this section the one with the \n\nlargest C contents (17-38%). The upper 18 cm show an increase in mineral matter content. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 4 - Records of factor scores of the first component (PC1) for the studied cores \n \n\n In PI, two sections are distinguished by the distribution of PC1scores, one between 218-\n\n102 cm with more irregular peaky distribution and another in the upper 102 cm with a continuous \n\ndecrease in mineral matter.  \n\n In SV, very large PC1 scores are observed below 100 cm, decreasing values until 70 cm, \n\nalmost constant scores until 30 cm and a later increase to the top of the core.  \n\n2.4.2 Dust fluxes from regional sources \n\n The second component, PC2, shows large positive loadings for Ti, Al and Zr (Table 3). \n\nThese elements are usually considered as tracers of the mineral matter content of the peat \n\n(SHOTYK, 1988). Thus, it is somewhat surprising that they do not load in the same component \n\nof the PCA as the other proxies for mineral matter. The main reason for this most probably relies \n\non the fact that the dominant lithological material of the catchment is quartzite and quartz is the \n\nmain mineral that is provided during episodes of local erosion. If PC1 is interpreted as a local \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nsignal, then PC2 is likely to reflect the deposition of mineral dust after longer transport, i.e. a dust \n\nregional signal \u2013which may be only seen in periods of stability in the catchment of the mires. \n\nThis is also supported by the fact that Ti, Zr and Al tend to concentrate in finer grain sizes \n\n(TABOADA et al., 2006). Given the location of the mires and the distribution of geological \n\nmaterials in the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional, the sources for the regional signal are likely to be \n\nat a distance of  >40-50 km. \n\n For Zr, although PC2 is the main factor controlling its concentrations in the peat, it also \n\nhas a small proportion of its variance (12%; Figure 3) associated to PC1; thus, secondary \n\nincreases in Zr at certain depths can also be associated with local sources. \n\n The Ti concentrations (0.01-2.0%; APPENDIX I_C) have minima lower than those in \n\nTRE-o (0.03-0.6%) and TRE-m (0.2-2.1%) and maxima comparable to those of TRE-m; Al (0.2-\n\n18%; APPENDIX I_B) has minima comparable to those of TRE-o (0.1-1.4%) and TRE-m (0.7-\n\n2.6%) and maxima higher than those in both types of mires; and Zr (3-545 ppm; APPENDIX \n\nI_D) has minima comparable to those in TRE-o (5-181 ?g g-1) than TRE-m (41-996 ?g g-1) and \n\nmaxima not comparable with any of those.  \n\n PC2 scores show an increasing trend in PdF-I, with some minima at 320 cm, 180-160 cm, \n\n100-50 cm and at 20 cm (Figure 5). SJC and PI show a similar record of scores, with higher \n\nvalues from 50-30 cm to the base of the cores (with small variations) and sharply decreasing \n\nscores in the upper peat sections. PdF-II and SV are characterized by pronounced peaks in scores \n\nat certain depths (160 cm, 90 cm and at the surface in PdF-II, and 110 cm, 30 cm and the surface \n\nin SV; Figure 5). Thus, while PdF-I shows an increasing contribution of dust from distant \n\nsources, SJC and PI suggest almost constant fluxes until a given phase when the fluxes abruptly \n\ndeclined; meanwhile PdF-II and SV suggest the presence of events of intense regional dust \n\ndeposition, including the most recent periods reflected by the upper peat sections. \n\n2.4.3 Plant remains preserved \n\n The third component, PC3, accounts for the fibre content of the peat (RF and URF; Table \n\n3), and it can be interpret as an indicator of the abundance of plant macro-remains. Plant remains \n\ncan be preserve in peatlands due to the low pH and predominant anoxic conditions. According to \n\nInanuzzi and Vieira (2005), the tissues and structures of terrestrial plants are preserved in the \n\npreference sequence: exine (comprising of sporopollenin, outer membrane of spores and pollen \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n  \n \nFigure 5 - Records of factor scores of the second component (PC2) for the studied cores \n\n \n \n\ngrains), cuticle (comprising of cutin, waxy outer layer that covers the surface of various portions \n\nof the aerial plant as young stems, leaves and reproductive structures) and xylem (comprising \n\nlignin and cellulose, woody portion of the conducting system). In the studied mires, pollen \n\n(HOR\u00c1K, 2009), stems, leaf debris and wood fragment were found (Figure 2). The small but \n\nsignificant negative loading of the URF (accounting for 10% of the variance; Figure 3) in PC1 \n\nsuggests that i) preservation of plant remains is lower in peat sections with higher mineral matter \n\ncontent (probably because of enhanced decomposition), or simply ii) that the basal mineral layers \n\nwere never colonized by vegetation.  \n\n The TRE mires (0-72%; APPENDIX E_A) have URF minima lower than those seen in \n\nTRE-o (64-89%), TRE-m (65-71%), TEG-o (18-87%) and TEG-m (27-91%), but comparable \n\nmaxima. Meanwhile, RF (0-56%; APPENDIX E_B) have minima comparable to those of TRS \n\n(0-2% in DF, 0-60% in PR, 0-20% in RJ, 4-16% in RS and 0-4% in SP) and TEG-m (2-73%), \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \n\nand maxima similar to those seen in TRE-o (53-73%), TRE-m (10-52%), TEG-o (12-53%) and \n\nTEG-m; minima and maxima values of RF from MG (14-36%) are very high and low, \n\nrespectively. \n\n PdF-I and SV show a similar record of PC3 scores (Figure 6), with increases between \n\n126-25 cm and 22-6 cm respectively, almost constant values at the deeper layers and minima in \n\nintermediate sections; however, a more abrupt decrease in the surface layer occurs in SV than in \n\nPdF-I. SJC and PI also show similar records of scores (Figure 6), with increases from the mineral \n\nbase to respectively 118 cm and 38 cm (PI with larger variations than SJC), followed by a \n\ndecrease to 18 cm and 10 cm and a return to higher values at the surface. Meanwhile PdF-II is \n\ncharacterized by pronounced peaks in scores at certain depths (150-110 cm, 58-46 cm and 22-6 \n\ncm). Since the major variations in scores occur in PdF-II, SJC and PI, these cores may reflect a \n\nhigher frequency of changes in environmental conditions responsible for the preservation of plant \n\nremains. \n\n \n   \nFigure 6 - Records of factor scores of the third component (PC3) for the studied cores \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n2.4.4 Degree of peat decomposition \n\n The fourth component, PC4, is represented by the C/N ratio and BDO (Table 3), which \n\ncan be considered as proxies for the degree of peat decomposition. High C/N ratios and BDO \n\nmay be associated with a more humified organic matter (ANDRIESSE, 1988) and/or with \n\norganic compounds poor in N under intense mineralization processes (SWIFT, 1996). On the \n\nother hand, part of BDO variance is associated with PC1 (14%; Figure 3), the negative loading \n\nindicating that the presence of mineral matter negatively affects the density of the organic matter.  \n\n The C/N ratio (12-92) has minima comparable to those of TRE-m (14-40) and TEG-m \n\n(10-44) than TRE-o (25-41) and TEG-o (23-39), but higher maxima. Most of the low C/N ratio \n\nvalues of TRS (18-25 in DF, 15- 22 in MG, 18-40 in PR, 15-31 in RJ, 18-28 in RS and 22-37 in \n\nSP) are comparable and maxima values are lower than those determined in this work. The BDO \n\n(0.02-0.30 Mg m-3) has minima and maxima lower than those seen in TRE-m (0.03-0.44 Mg m-3) \n\nand TRE-o (0.24-0.35 Mg m-3), and minima lower and maxima higher than those seen in TRS \n\n(0.14-0.15 Mg m-3 in DF, 0.09-0.18 Mg m-3 in MG, 0.11-0.20 Mg m-3 in PR, 0.08-0.17 Mg m-3 in \n\nRJ, 0.04-0.12 Mg m-3 in RS and 0.19-0.23 Mg m-3 in SP). \n\n As observed in Figure 7, the changes in PC4 scores show general decreasing trends from a \n\ncertain depth to the surface (after 298 cm in PdF-I, 158 cm in PdF-II, 90 cm in SJC, 138 cm in PI \n\nand 114 cm in SV), therefore indicating a signficant change from higher to lower degree of peat \n\ndecomposition. This is in agreement with the idea of a unidirectional evolution, with older peat \n\nbeing subjected for longer to decomposition processes. However, despite the variation is not very \n\nlarge in the sections were the PC4 scores decrease, some local peaks are seen in PdF-I (227 cm, \n\n207 cm, 60 cm and 25 cm), PdF-II (138 cm, 102 cm, 58 cm and 2 cm), SJC (30-22 cm and 10-0 \n\ncm), PI (122 cm, 106 cm and 90 cm) and SV (94-70 cm, 26 cm and 18 cm), possibly indicating \n\ndrier phases, since a drier environment enhances decomposition. The von Post degree of the \n\ndecomposition shows almost the same trends of PC4 scores, except in PI from the base to 90 cm \n\nand SV from the base to 30 cm, possibly due to the large amount of FNE at these depths which \n\nmay lead to an underestimate of the von Post value. \n\n2.5 Conclusion \n\n The morphological, physico-chemical, and elemental properties of mountain mires from \n\nthe Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional are comparable to those of other tropical mountain peatlands  \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 7 - Records of factor scores of the fourth component (PC4) for the studied cores \n \n\nand also to temperate mountain peatlands. Furthermore, the properties show variations in depth, \n\nmost of them with a particular pattern for each core, which is in agreement with the peat \n\nstratigraphy. The physico-chemical properties and elemental composition of the peat seem to \n\nhave responded to four main processes: relative accumulation of organic (C, N, GM) and mineral \n\nmatter (MR, BD, MM, Si) linked to the evolution of the catchment soils (erosion in particular), \n\ndeposition of dust from distant/regional sources (Al, Ti, Zr), preservation of plant remains (URF, \n\nRF), and long-term and short-term peat decomposition (C/N ratio and BDO). Our results indicate \n\nthat tropical mountain mires from Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional besides being very old are also \n\ncomplex involving numerous properties and processes. They should be preserved and protected \n\nin full.   \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAIRA, M.J.; GUITI\u00c1N OJEA, F.

Of these, multi-proxy investigations using peatlands are still absent, \nalthough these ecosystems are extremely sensitive to changes in hydrology and have a large \npotential for the reconstruction of climate changes. In this paper, we present the Holocene record \nof environmental changes occurred in central-eastern Brazil reconstructed from a core sampled in \nPau de Fruta mire (Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional, Minas Gerais State, Brazil). We combined \npalynological and geochemical analyses, supported by core stratigraphy, 14C dating and \nmultivariate statistics. The location of the mire is ideal because it is in an area which is influenced \nby the activity of the South America Monsoon Systems (SAMS) and is directly associated with \nthe South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Our findings enabled to describe six main phases \nof change suggested by vegetation and local and regional landscape dynamics. In phase I \n(?10,000-7360 cal BP) the climate was wet and cold and was accompanied by soil instability in \nthe mire catchment (severe local erosion) and the 8.2 ka event was easily recognizable by a large \nincrease in the deposition of regional dusts. Phase II (?7360-4200 cal BP) was characterized by \nwet and warm conditions, catchment soils stability and enhanced deposition of regional dusts. In \nphase III (?4200-2200 cal BP), climate was dry and warm and soil erosion in the catchment \nincreased again. In phase IV (?2200-1160 cal BP) dry and punctuated cooling was reconstructed, \ntogether with enhanced deposition of regional dusts. Phase V (?1160-400 cal BP) reflects sub-\nhumid climatic conditions, the lowest inputs of local and regional dust and the largest \naccumulation of peat in the mire. While in phase VI (&lt;?400 cal BP) sub-humid conditions \ncontinued but both local and regional erosion largely increased. Although climate seems to have \nbeen the most important driving force of environmental change, human activities (arrival of \neuropeans to Brazil, gold and diamond mining in the area, increased population and construction \nof infrastructures, extensive deforestation) are likely to have been at least partially responsible of \nthe significant changes recorded over the past 400 years. A phase-space approach enabled to \nsynthesize the evolutionary stages of the mire. Our results demonstrate that the tropical peatlands \nof Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional contain relevant records of the Holocene climate changes, and \nthat a multi-proxy approach offers good opportunities for a detailed reconstruction of \npalaeoenvironments.  \n\nKeywords: Peatlands; Histosols; South America Monsoon Systems; Central-eastern Brazil; \nPollen; Geochemistry \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\n The South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) is one of the main features of South \n\nAmerica Monsoon Systems (SAMS) during the Austral summer, associated with intense \n\nconvective activity in the Amazon region (GARREAUD et al., 2009). Subtropical jet along the \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n\nconvergence zone and runoff from low levels in the poleward (KODAMA, 1993) are important \n\naspects of large-scale atmospheric circulation that are associated to the tropical intraseasonal \n\noscillation (Madden-Julian Oscillation - MJO) (MADDEN; JULIAN, 1994), interannual \n\noscillation (El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation cycle - ENSO) (KOUSKY; KAYANO, 1994) and the \n\nlatitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (STR\u00cdKIS et al., 2011), \n\nproviding intrinsic control of the SAMS precipitation activity. During the peak monsoon season \n\nin central-eastern Brazil (December-February), negative precipitation anomalies cause warm \n\nsurface temperatures and an anomalous low-level cyclonic circulation, thus moisture flux is \n\nenhanced (GRIMM, 2003; GRIMM; PAL; GIORGI, 2007) and precipitation increases.  \n\n Some authors have proposed a link between changes in Holocene precipitation of the \n\nSAMS and the Bond events (BOND et al., 2001). Studying proxies of drift ice measured in deep-\n\nsea sediment cores in the subpolar North Atlantic, including hematite-stained grains (HSG), \n\nicelandic glass (IG), and detrital carbonate (DC), Bond et al. (2001) observed a dominant \n\nperiodicity present in surface winds and surface ocean hydrography, influenced by periods of low \n\nsolar activity (high 14C based on the atmospheric ?14C record) through the entire Holocene. These \n\nperiodicities are known as Bond IRD (ice-rafted debris) events (1.4, 2.7, 4.2, 5.5, 7,4, and 9.2 kyr \n\nBP - in the order of Bond event 1 to Bond event 6) and have been linked to shifts in the intensity \n\nof the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, changes in sea surface temperature (SST), and intense \n\ncold conditions over the Northern Hemisphere. The association of the Bond events with abrupt, \n\ncentennial to millennial scale, changes in SAMS precipitation was suggested to indicate wetter \n\nconditions in the Southern Hemisphere (BAKER et al., 2001, 2005; ARZ et al., 2001; EKDAHL \n\net al., 2008). For example, the oxygen isotope record of speleothems from Lapa Grande (Minas \n\nGerais State, central-eastern Brazil), presented abrupt fluctuations punctuating the entire \n\nHolocene (STR\u00cdKIS et al., 2011), closely corresponding with Bond events 6, 5, 4 and the 8.2 kyr \n\nBP event. Response to Bond events 1 and 3 was not observed in this record, while other wet \n\nevents at times of low IRD input to the North Atlantic occurred at 7.1 and 6.6 kyr BP. Moister \n\nand cooler conditions between 9.2 and 8.0 kyr BP, followed again by an arid period between ca. \n\n5.5 and 4.5 kyr BP, and a trend towards modern conditions since then were inferred for the region \n\nof Salitre (western Minas Gerais State; LEDRU, 1993), from the pollen record of a peat core. In \n\nLagoa Santa (central Minas Gerais State), dates for the majority of archaeological burials cluster \n\naround two peaks: 10-8 kyr BP and 2-1 kyr BP, with a period of 6000 years in which they are \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nalmost absent. This period is called the \u201cArchaic Gap\u201d and was related to a phase of \n\nabandonment of settlements and depopulation due to the onset of arid conditions (ARAUJO et \n\nal., 2005). \n\n The Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) is located in the tropical \n\nlatitudes and is one of the few mountainous regions of Brazil were peatlands have formed since \n\nthe Pleistocene (CAMPOS et al., 2010). These wetlands ecosystems are extremely sensitive to \n\nchanges in hydrology and peat records have been extensively used to reconstruct changes in \n\nprecipitation in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly for the Holocene (BOOTH; JACKSON; \n\nNOTARO, 2010; CHAMBERS et al., 2010; MONTERO-SERRANO et al., 2010), while few \n\ninvestigations using peat records are available for the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere in \n\nparticular (MARKGRAF, 1985; LEDRU, 1993; MARKGRAF; ANDERSON, 1994; WEISS et \n\nal., 2002; MULLER et al., 2008; DALEY et al., 2012). On the other hand, present climatic \n\nconditions in the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o are directly influenced by the activity of the SAMS, which \n\nsuggests that peat records obtained from the peatlands of the area have a large potential to \n\ninvestigate on climate changes in central-eastern Brazil. \n\n In this study we present a detailed reconstruction of climate and environmental change in \n\nthe Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional, based on a multi-proxy (stratigraphy, physical properties, \n\npollen and geochemistry) study of a peat core sampled in Pau the Fruta mire, which comprises \n\nthe whole Holocene period. The results obtained are compared with those found in the area using \n\nother environmental archives and proxies. \n\n3.2 Material and Methods \n\n The PdF-I core was collected in Pau de Fruta (18\u00ba15\u201927,08\u201d S 43\u00ba40\u20193,64\u201d W), a mire \n\nlocated at 1350 m a.s.l. in the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional, Minas Gerais State (Brazil) (Figure \n\n1). Sampling was done in 2008 using a vibracore (MARTIN; FLEXOR; SUGUIO, 1995), and a \n\ncore of 428 cm in length was recovered. The present soil is classified as a Hemic Haplosaprists \n\n(SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2010). The basal lithology corresponds to the Sopa-Brumadinho \n\n(Guinda Group) formation (Paleo-Mesoproterozoic), mostly constituted by quartzites, but also \n\ngreen schists and hematitic phylites (KNAUER, 2007). \n\n   \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure. 1 - Location of Pau de Fruta mire, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Lithological map of the sampling location \n\nand nearby regions and stratigraphy of the PdF-I core. Other palaeoclimate records: LG (Lapa Grande; \nStr\u00edkis et al., 2011);  LSN (Lagoa de Serra Negra; De Oliveira, 1992); SA (Salitre; Ledru, 1993); LN \n(Lagoa Nova; Behling, 2003); LP (Lago do Pires; Behling, 1995a); LO (Lagoa dos Olhos, De Oliveira, \n1992); LS (Lagoa Santa; PARIZZI et al., 1998) \n\n \n\n Present climate is characterized as tropical mountainous, according to K\u00f6ppen \n\nclassification, with an average annual precipitation of 1500 mm (NIMER, 1977). Rainfall is \n\ncontrolled by the activity of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), which is one of the \n\nmost prominent characteristics of the South Atlantic Monsoon System (SAMS) during the austral \n\nsummer, associated to intense convective activity in the Amazonian region (GARREAUD et al., \n\n2009). The SACZ extends in a southeastern direction from the interior of the continent to the \n\nSouth Atlantic (VERA et al., 2006). From the end of the monsoon period, rainfall almost ceases \n\nfrom May to October. \n\n Vegetation is that typical of Cerrado biome (savanna), one of the most endangered in the \n\nworld, but also contains a mosaic of patches of tree species (seasonal semi-deciduous forest and \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nCerrad\u00e3o), called \"Cap\u00f5es\", which appear as small island dispersed among grassland formations \n\n(wet grassland: Campo Limpo \u00damido, dry grassland: Campo Limpo Seco, and rupicola-\n\nsaxicolous grassland: Campo Rupestre) within the mire. \n\n The core stratigraphy is composed of 10 horizons and 3 inorganic layers (Figure 1), which \n\nare named according to the terminology of the Soil Survey Staff (2010). They basically differ in \n\nthe content of mineral/organic matter, texture of the inorganic component, degree of peat \n\ndecomposition and consistency (described according to FAO, 2006 and SCHOENEBERGER et \n\nal., 2012). The basal layers (3C, 2C e C; >404 cm) are quartzitic mineral sediments. Horizon Oa7 \n\n(404-298 cm) contains many fine roots but organic matter is highly sapric, and there are sections \n\nwith higher proportions of mineral matter at 404-400 cm, 381-365 cm, 328-327 cm, 316-315 cm \n\nand 305-300 cm; charcoal (355-330 cm) and wood fragments (340 cm) were also found. Horizon \n\nOa6 (298-278 cm) is sticky and sapric, with low fibre content, and occasional charcoal. Horizon \n\nOa5 (278-202 cm) is also sapric, less sticky and with higher fibre content than the underlying \n\nhorizon; charcoal particles were found at 278-258 cm, 235-230 cm and 210-200 cm, and wood \n\nfragments at 275 cm and 255 cm. Horizon Oa4 (202-158 cm) has a very high mineral content, but \n\nthe material is sticky because of the sapric nature of the organic matter; scattered charcoal \n\nparticles were also found. Horizon Oa3 (158-137 cm) has a lower mineral matter content than \n\nOa4, it is less sticky and has higher fibre content, with charcoal fragments between 146-137 cm. \n\nHorizon Oa2 (137-125 cm) is also sapric, highly sticky, has low fibre content, and scattered \n\ncharcoal fragments. Horizon Oe-i (125-119 cm) is hemic-fibric, with a mixture of fine and \n\ncoarser fibres. Horizon Oa (119-113 cm) is sapric; no charcoal was found. Horizon Oi-e (113-60 \n\ncm) is fibric-hemic and the upper horizon, Oi (60-0 cm), is highly fibric. \n\n3.2.1 Pollen study  \n\n Physico-chemical treatment for the extraction of pollen, spores and other non-pollen \n\npalynomorphs (NPP) followed the procedure described in Ybert et al. (1992), using an ultrasound \n\nto separate large organic remains. Samples correspond to sections of 1 cm in thickness taken \n\nevery 20 cm. Counting was done at 40 X under the microscope, obtaining a total land pollen sum \n\n(TLP) of 8685 grains. Hydro-hygrophytes and NPP were not included in the TLP, but are \n\nexpressed as percentages of it. Average hydro-hygrophytes and NPP sum was 3478 \n\npalynomorphs. Identification was aided by a reference collection of the Pau de Fruta mire hosted \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nat the laboratory of N\u00facleo de Pesquisa em Palinologia do Instituto de Bot\u00e2nica do Estado de S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo, Brazil, identification keys and atlases (VAN GEEL, 1978; TRYON; TRYON, 1982; \n\nROUBIK; MORENO, 1991). Taxa included in the TLP are considered to be indicators of the \n\nregional vegetation, while hydro-hygrophytes and NPP are considered to mainly provide a local \n\nsignal. Nevertheless, we have to remind that some hydro-hygrophytes may also be part of \n\nregional communities, as for example the Cyperaceae. The opposite may occur with Poaceae and \n\nEricaceae, which are considered as regional components but they may also be present in local \n\ncommunities. Environmental requirements for regional taxa follow those described by Mendon\u00e7a \n\net al. (1998) and Marchant et al. (2002), and hydro-hygrophytes and NPP by van Geel (1978) and \n\nvan Geel; Coope and van Der Hammen (1989). Pollen diagrams were done using TILIA software \n\n(GRIMM, 1992).  \n\n3.2.2 Elemental and isotopic composition \n\n Carbon and N contents and isotopic composition (?\n13C and ?\n\n15N) were determined in \n\ndried, milled and homogenized samples of 10 cm in thickness, using a elemental analyzer \n\ncoupled to a mass spectrometer hosted at the Laborat\u00f3rio de Is\u00f3topos Est\u00e1veis of the Centro de \n\nEnergia Nuclear na Agricultura - CENA/USP (Piracicaba, SP, Brasil). Major, minor and trace \n\nelements (Si, Al, Fe, Ti, S, P, Ca, K, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mn, Ni, Cr, Cl, Br) were determined by \n\nX-ray fluorescence using two energy dispersive XRF analyzers (CHEBURKIN; SHOTYK, 1996; \n\nWEISS; CHEBURKIN; SHOTYK, 1998) hosted at the RIAIDT facility (Infrastructure Network \n\nfor the Support of Research and Technological Development) of the University of Santiago de \n\nCompostela (Spain). The instruments were calibrated using several reference materials. \n\nDetections limits for organic matrices are:&lt;0.01% for Al, Si, S, K, Ca and Fe; 0.005% for P; \n\n0.001% for Mn; 0.0005% for Ti; 10 ?g g-1 for Cl; 1 ?g\u00b7 g-1 for Cr, Ni, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr and Nb. \n\nDetection limits for mineral matrices are: 0.1% for Al; 0.05% for Si; 0.04% for K; 0.01% for Ca \n\nand Fe; 0.006% for P; 0.004% for S; 0.002% for Ti and Mn; 10 ?g g-1 for Cl; 1 ?g g-1 for Cr, Ni, \n\nBr, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr and Nb. \n\n3.2.3 Radiocarbon age dating and age/depth model \n\n Eleven samples were radiocarbon dated by AMS in the AMS Laboratory of Georgia \n\nUniversity (UGAMS, USA) and Beta Analytic Inc. (Miami, USA). The results were calibrated \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nusing SHCal04.14C calibration curve (REIMER et al., 2009). The age-depth model was obtained \n\nusing the Clam.R application developed by Blaauw (2010); the best fit was obtained with a \n\nsmooth-spline solution. In the text ages are thus provided as calibrated values unless specified \n\notherwise. For the sake of consistency, ages found in the literature as conventional values were \n\nalso converted to calibrated ones when the uncertainty term was available or assuming a \u00b150 \n\nuncertainty when it was not.  \n\n3.2.4 Statistical analysis \n\n Stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis (total sum of squares method; GRIMM, \n\n1987) was applied to pollen and NPP data to define regional and local palynological zones. \n\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) was also performed on the transposed data matrices of the \n\nregional and local types and NPP. This type of analysis enables an intuitive interpretation of \n\npollen data from an ecological point of view summarizing the pollen composition of the samples \n\nbased on co-variation (L\u00d3PEZ-MERINO et al., 2012). The data was log-transformed and \n\nstandardized before analysis, as suggested for compositional data (i.e close data sets) \n\n(REIMANN et al., 2008). The PCA was performed in the correlation mode and a varimax \n\nrotation was applied to maximize the loadings of the variables in the components (ERIKSSON et \n\nal., 1999). It was also applied to geochemical data in the same conditions as pollen data, but \n\nwithout transposing the data matrices. PCA was done using SPSS 20.0 software. \n\n3.3 Results and discussion \n\n3.3.1 Pollen study \n\n The complete pollen diagrams for the regional and local taxa and NPP are provided in \n\nAPPENDICES J and K. Assemblages of regional and local pollen types are interpreted to \n\nrepresent phytophysionomies (based on environmental requirements as indicated above, \n\nAPPENDICES L and M): semi-deciduous forest (Floresta Semidecidua), mountain forest \n\n(Floresta Montana), wet grasslands (Campo Limpo \u00damido), dry grassland (Campo Limpo Seco), \n\nrupicola-saxicolous grassland (Campo Rupestre), savanna (Cerrado lato sensu). The savanna also \n\ncontains forested and shrubs formations (Cerrad\u00e3o). Some plant genus found in these \n\nphytophysionomies and respective pollen types can be seen in the APPENDICES N, O, P and Q, \n\nand some NPP in APPENDIX R.  \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n \n\n Principal components analysis of the regional types resulted in three components \n\nexplaining almost 80% of the total variance (Table 1). The first component, PC1R (?39% \n\nvariance), is represented by large (score > 1.0) to moderate (score 0.5-1.0) abundances of pollen \n\ntypes representative of vegetation formations of semi-deciduous forest (Schefflera, Myrtaceae,  \n \n\nTable 1 - Eingenvalues and variance explained by the principal components obtained by PCA analysis of the \ntransposed data matrix of regional (R) and local (L) taxa (hydro-hygrophytes and NPP) of PdF-I core  \n\nComponent 1Eigenv 2Var (%)   Component 1Eigenv 2Var (%)   \nPC1R 8.1 38.6  PC1L 6.2 29.5 \nPC2R 5.6 26.9  PC2L 5.6 26.5 \nPC3R 3.0 14.2  PC3L 4.6 21.7 \n\n 1Eigenv: eigenvalues; 2Var (%): percentage of explained variance \n\n \nFigure 2 - Factor scores of the pollen types and NPP characterizing the three PCA components (transposed matrix) \n\nobtained for the regional (R) and local (L) signal of PdF-I core.

The component is also characterised \n\nby low abundances (negative scores) or absence of assemblages representative of humid savanna \n\n(also adapted to water streams; Ferdinandusa, Erythroxylum, Guettarda, Croton, \n\nMenispermaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Hyeronima, Proteaceae, Salicaceae, Rudgea and Strychnos) \n\nand dry savanna (Zanthoxylum, Ochnaceae, Buchnera lavandulaceae, Rubiaceae, Byrsonima and \n\nAmaranthus), and some taxa of rupicola-saxicolous grassland  (Eriocaulaceae) and generalist \n\ngrassland types (Ichthyoyhere and Bidens). Thus, PC1R reflects wet but also cold conditions, as \n\nsupported by the presence of mountain forest taxa like Drimys, Podocarpus, Mimosa scabrella, \n\nWeinmannia and Myrsine (APPENDIX J). \n\n The second principal component, PC2R (?27% of variance), is represented by large to \n\nmoderate abundances (positive scores) of types typical of semi-deciduous forest (Trema, \n\nAlchornea, Sorocea and some taxa of Melastomataceae), dry savanna (Borreria, Zanthoxylum, \n\nOchnaceae, Celtis, Rubiaceae, Cecropia and Buchnera lavandulacea), rupicola-saxicolous \n\ngrassland (Xyris, Paepalanthus, Gaylussacia and some taxa of Melastomataceae), as well as \n\ngenaralist grassland types (Poaceae, Baccharis and Gomphrena) (Figure 2). Low abundances \n\n(negative scores) were found for taxa of wet grassland (Eryngium), semi-deciduous \n\n(Aristolochiaceae, Myrtaceae and Piper) and mountain (Myrsine) forests and humid savanna \n\n(Erythroxylum, Guettarda, Proteaceae, Salicaceae, Croton, Rudgea and Strychnos); some types of \n\ndry savanna (Amaranthus), rupicola-saxicolous grassland (Syngonanthus) and generalist \n\ngrassland types (Plantago and Monocot) also showed low abundance. Although mountain forest \n\ntaxa were present sporadically, including Drymis, Podocarpus, Weinmannia, Ilex and Myrsine \n\n(APPENDIX J), they rarely occured together. PC2R points to drier and warmer conditions.  \n\n The third component, PC3R (?14% of variance), shows larger abundances of pollen types \n\nof humid savanna (Guettarda, Ferdinandusa, Erythroxylum, Croton, Menispermaceae and \n\nRudgea), semi-deciduous forest (Aristolochiaceae), rupicola-saxicolous grassland (Eriocaulaceae \n\nand Xyris), wet grassland (Emmeorhiza), as well as some generalist grassland types (Baccharis, \n\nIchthyothere, Poaceae, Gomphrena and Monocot) (Figure 2). Low abundances are found for \n\ncertain taxa characteristic of semi-deciduous (Schefflera, Myrtaceae, Tapirira and Alchornea) \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n \n\nand mountain (Myrsine and Podocarpus) forests, dry savanna (Zanthoxylum, Byrsonima, Celtis, \n\nRubiaceae and Cecropia), rupicola-saxicolous grassland (Gaylussacia, Paepalanthus and \n\nSyngonanthus) and genaralist grassland types (Plantago and Monocot). This heterogeneity of \n\nphytophysionomies suggests that this component reflects variations in moisture (humidity) and \n\ntemperature probably due to well-expressed climate seasonality. \n\n For the local pollen signal three components explained almost 78% of the variance (Table \n\n1). The first component, PC1L (?30% of variance), is characterised by large abundances of \n\nhydro-hygrophytes (Araceae and Bacopa) as well as NPP indicators of wet conditions like \n\nAssulina (VAN GEEL; MIDDELDORP, 1988; VAN GEEL; COOPE; VAN DER HAMMEN, \n\n1989) and Meliola niessleana (fungi parasite on Calluna; VAN GEEL, 1976). The \n\nepiphyte/herbaceous Polypodium is indicative of the presence of semi-deciduous forests \n\n(SEHNEM, 1970), although at present it has also been found in rupicola-saxicolous grassland and \n\nsavanna in the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional (MENDON\u00c7A et al., 1998); while Cyperaceae and \n\nAchyrocline may appear under diverse humidity conditions. Low abundances are suggested for \n\nGelasinospora, a fungi indicating dry and oligotrophic conditions (VAN GEEL, 1976), and the \n\nfern Notholaena which is typical of warm, arid to semi-arid conditions (NOBEL, 1978). Thus, \n\nthis component indicates local wet, and probably cold, conditions.  \n\n The second component, PC2L (?26% of variance), shows larger abundances of types \n\nrepresentative of wet grassland (Araceae and Sagittaria), plants as Calluna (NPP fungi Meliola \n\nniessleana) and the algae Spirogyra and Botryococcus, which suggest wet but changing \n\nhydrological conditions (GUY-OHLSON, 1992). The positive scores of Glomus and Blechnum \n\npoint to hydric soil erosion (VAN GEEL; APTROOT, 2006). Landscape disturbance is also \n\nindicated by Pteridium, a fern usually found in ecological successions of degradation stages, \n\nparticularly after fires (ELLIOT; FLENLEY; SUTTON, 1998). Low abundances of Bacopa, the \n\nfern Dennstaedtia and the fungi Assulina, all indicators of wet conditions, were also observed. \n\nThe component reflects local perturbations, with pervasive hydrological changes and soil erosion. \n\n The third component, PC3L (?22% of variance), shows larger abudances of types and \n\nNPP pointing to variable humidity/shallow open water conditions (Araceae, Mougeottia, \n\nSellaginella and Debarya; ELLIS-ADAM; VAN GEEL, 1978), presence of fires (Pteridium) and \n\nopen, altered environments (Pityrogramma trifoliata; S\u00c1NCHEZ-GONZ\u00c1LEZ; Z\u00da\u00d1IGA; \n\nTEJERO-D\u00cdEZ, 2010). Debarya has also been described as an airbone algae (KO?ACZEK et al., \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n2012), and probably related to greater activity of the monsoon system. Bacopa, Spyrogira, \n\nAssulina and Meliola niessleana, indicators of wet conditions, were low. This assemblage of \n\npolen types and NPP reflect limited, variable, humid conditions, an open forest landscape and \n\nfires.  \n\n Constrained cluster analysis enabled to identify five and six regional and local pollen \n\nzones (PZ), respectively (APPENDICES J and K). The regional and local zones are almost \n\nidentical (except that the fifth regional PZ corresponds to the last two local PZ) and agree well \n\nwith major stratigraphic units and the record of the components obtained with PCA (Figure 3).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 - Squared factor loadings of the three regional (R) and local (L) PCA components (transposed matrix) \n\nexplaining the variation of the signal of the PdF-I core \n \n\n In PZ-1 (401-298 cm) samples are dominated by PC1R (75-90% of variance) and PC1L \n\n(73-93% of variance), with small contributions of PC3R (24-42%) and PC3L (14-39%) (Figure \n\n3), indicating a landscape with dominant and dense forest vegetation composed of semi-\n\ndeciduous and mountain forests, and wet and rupicola-saxicolous grasslands. Thus, climatic \n\nconditions in PZ-1 were wet and cold, with short events of slight reductions in humidity and \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n\nincrease in temperature, as supported by small variations of a more seasonal vegetation and \n\nindicators of hydrological changes and erosion. \n\n In PZ-2 (298-202 cm) there is a moderate decrease in PC1R (to 64%) and a more intense \n\none in PC1L (to 34%) (Figure 3). At the same time the contribution of PC2R (up to 60%) and \n\nPC3L (up to 83%) increase significantly, while PC3R shows minimum contributions (3-18%) and \n\nPC2L slightly increases (up to 40%). PC3L dominates the local signal at the end of the zone. \n\nConditions seem to start to diversify, more readily at local scale and then at regional scale. A \n\ntrend to opening of the semi-deciduous and mountain forests was followed by a more \n\ncharacteristic savanna vegetation, in a progressive way. Nevertheless, although a certain decline \n\nis observed, forests were the dominant formations and amid frequent fires. This scenario reflects \n\na gradual reduction in humidity and warming. \n\n PZ-3 (202-158 cm) mostly represents the consolidation of the trends developed in PZ-2, \n\nwith a further slight decrease in PC1R (to 54%) and PC1L (30%), and stabilization of PC2R and \n\nPC3L (Figure 3). The remnants of semi-deciduous and mountain forests and the wet grasslands \n\nwere probably located near water courses, while a more or less sparse savanna vegetation covered \n\nthe area. PZ-3 represents a change from forest vegetation of humid and cold conditions to one \n\nindicating a drier and warmer climate, with the highest frequency of fires and where also the level \n\nof disturbance, due to changes in hydrology and/or erosion, started to increase. \n\n PZ-4 (158-60 cm) shows a definitive decrease in PC1R (to 9%) and its substitution by \n\nPC2R which attains its maximum contribution in the record (up to 85%). At local scale PC3L is \n\nsubstituted by a large increase in PC2L (up to 79% contribution; Figure 3). The expansion of the \n\nsavanna peaked while semi-deciduous and mountain forests showed the lowest abundances of the \n\nrecord, indicating the highest levels of regional aridity. Fires, although still frequent, started to \n\ngradually decrease but catchment disturbance remained. A slight increase of local wet grasslands \n\nalso occurred. Climatic conditions in PZ-4 seem to have been drier and warmer, but often \n\ninterrupted by short periods of cooling \u2013as the occurrence of taxa characteristic of very cold \n\nconditions (i.e. Anadenathera, Drimys, Weinmannia and Myrsine) indicates. \n\n PZ-5 (<60 cm) is characterised at regional scale by large contributions of PC3R (up to \n\n65%), a decrease in PC2R (to 12%), and minimun, although slightly higher than in PZ-4, \n\ncontributions of PC1R (18-31%) (Figure 3). At a local scale, in this zone (60-20 cm) PCL2 \n\nbecomes dominant (up to 90%). With a reduction of savanna vegetation and a small increase in \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nsemi-deciduous and mountain forests, conditions of a seasonal and sub-humid climate (as the \n\npresent one) began to develop. Vegetation cover was more diverse than in the previous pollen \n\nzone, with rupicola-saxicolous grassland more abundant than semi-deciduous forests and woody-\n\nsavanna. On a local scale, the highest level of hydrological disturbance is detected. Increased \n\nhumidity and a decrease in temperature are suggested, with conditions similar to present climate. \n\n The local PZ-6 (upper 20 cm) is characterised by the total disappearance of PC3L and \n\ndominance of PC2L (Figure 3). None or low fire incidence and a slight recover of the humid \n\nforests support the interpretation of increased humidity and a relative decrease in temperature. \n\nHydrological changes and soil erosion were still high in recent decades. \n\n3.3.2 Geochemical composition of the peat  \n\n The records of selected physico-chemical properties and the analyzed elements are \n\nprovided in the supporting information (APPENDICES S, T and U). Four components explain \n\n80% of the total variance of the geochemical composition of the peat (Table 2). The first \n\ncomponent, GC1, explains 43% showing C, N, Cl, Br, Ca, P, Rb and Sr high positive loadings \n\n(>0.7), S, Ti and K moderate positive loadings (0.5-0.7), and ash content, Si and bulk density \n\n(BD) large negative loadings (Table 2). Most of the elements with positive loadings are \n\nbiophyllic (C, N, S, P, Ca, K) or organically bound (Cl and Br; BIESTER; MART\u00cdNEZ \n\nCORTIZAS; KEPPLER, 2006) elements and are surely dependent on the total organic matter \n\ncontent of the peat. While Si, Ti, Rb and Sr are elements hosted by inorganic mineral phases and \n\ncan thus be taken as indicative of the content of mineral matter; as it is also the case for the ash \n\ncontent and the BD. In contrast to what has been found in other peat records (see for example \n\nWEISS et al., 2002), the loadings of these elements indicate that concentrations of Ti, Rb and Sr \n\nincrease with increasing content of organic matter and decreasing Si, ash and BD. Since the main \n\ngeological material of the catchment of the mire is quartzite, Si contents are most probably \n\nrelated to the amount of quartz transported from the catchment soils to the mire. At the same \n\ntime, quartz is a mineral highly resistant to weathering that tends to concentrate in the sand \n\nfractions, while the other elements (Ti, Rb, Sr) usually concentrate in finer grain sizes (Ti, in \n\nparticular; TABOADA et al., 2006). Thus GC1 is likely to reflect a local signal: under stable \n\nconditions in the catchment the mire accumulated organic matter and soil dust of finer particle \n\nsize, while under unstable conditions larger amounts of coarse mineral matter (i.e. quartz from  \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Factor loadings for the four components extracted by PCA using the geochemical composition of the \nsamples of the PdF-I core \n\n \nGC1 GC2 GC3 GC4 \n\nN 0,93 0,25 \n  C 0,92 0,27 \n  Cl 0,80 \n\n   Br 0,80 \n  \n\n0,32 \nCa 0,79 0,41 \n\n  P 0,77 0,31 -0,42 \n Rb 0,76 0,42 \n\n  Sr 0,70 0,59 \n  S 0,69 0,26 \n \n\n-0,56 \nTi 0,69 0,63 \n\n  K 0,68 0,65 \n  Ash -0,88 \n\n   Si -0,88 \n   1BD -0,95 \n   Zr \n\n \n0,88 \n\n  Al \n \n\n0,85 \n  Y 0,49 0,77 \n  Nb 0,49 0,65 \n  Fe 0,27 \n\n \n0,93 \n\n Mn \n  \n\n0,89 \n Ni \n\n  \n0,80 \n\n Cr -0,53 \n \n\n0,77 \n ?13C \n\n \n0,37 \n\n \n0,75 \n\n?15N -0,59 \n  \n\n0,69 \n2Eigenv 10,3 4,5 3,1 1,5 \n\n3Var (%) 43 19 13 6 \n1BD: Bulk density; 2Eigenv: eigenvalues; 3Var (%): percentage of explained variance \n\n \n\nthe quartzite) were transported to the mire producing an increase in ash content, BD and a relative \n\ndilution of both OM and other minerals. Although GC1 is not the main factor controlling their \n\ncontents in the peat, Y and Nb also have a significant proportion of their variance (24%; Figure \n\n4) associated to GC1, supporting the interpretation of the physical fractionation effect (both have \n\npositive loadings and tend to be enriched in the finer fractions).  \n\n The second component, GC2, explains 19% of the variance, showing large positive \n\nloadings for Zr, Al, and Y, and a moderate one for Nb (Table 2). Some of the elements (K, Ti, Sr, \n\nRb, Ca) dominated by GC1 have part of their variance in GC2 (Figure 4). They are also \n\ncharacteristic of the mineral matter of the peat. Zirconium and Al variance is only associated to \n\nGC2 and, since GC1 is interpreted as a local signal, it is likely that they reflect the deposition of  \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure  4 - Fractionation of communalities of the variables used in the PCA of geochemical properties of the peat \n\nof PdF-I core. The communality of each variable (i.e the proportion of its variance explained by each \ncomponent) corresponds to the total length of the bar; the sections of the bars represent the proportion of \nvariance in each component. The variables are ordered by the component with the largest share of \nvariance \n\n \n\nmineral dust after longer transport. i.e. a dust regional signal. Except for Zr and Al, the PCA \n\nresults suggest that the other elements have at least two different sources (local and regional). \n\nThis is supported by the fact that the (K, Ti, Sr, Rb, Ca)/Zr ratios (not shown) are strongly \n\ncorrelated to GC1 scores (Pearson correlation coefficient, r 0.73-0.83) while the Al/Zr ratio is not \n\ncorrelated (r -0.11). Given the location of Pau de Fruta mire and the distribution of geological \n\nmaterials in the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional (Figure 1), the sources for the regional signal are \n\nlikely to be at a distance of  >40-50 km. \n\n The third component, GC3, explains 13% of the variance and the metals (Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr) \n\nare the elements showing large positive loadings (Table 2). Thus GC3 reflects the content in \n\nmetals of the peat. Most of the elements in this component have a marked redox behavior (see for \n\nexample CHESWORTH; MARTINEZ CORTIZAS; GARCIA-RODEJA, 2006) and, as it will be \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n \n\ndiscussed later, their co-occurrence in the same peat sections may reflect co-precipitation after \n\nbeing remobilized under anoxic conditions. But Cr also shows a significant proportion of its \n\nvariance (29%; Figure 4) associated to GC1, the negative loading indicating that its concentration \n\ntends to increase with the increase in quartz and coarse mineral matter in the peat, pointing to a \n\ncatchment source. \n\n The fourth component, GC4, explains 6% of the variance and is represented by the \n\nisotopic signature of the organic matter (?13C and ? 15N) (Table 2). The isotopic ratios also have a \n\nsignificant proportion of their variance in another component: ? 15N has a 35% in GC1 (Figure 4), \n\nits negative loading suggesting that the ratio is higher in horizons/layers containing higher \n\namounts of coarse mineral matter and lower in peat sections rich in organic matter; while ?13C \n\nhas a 14% of variance in GC2 (Figure 4), indicating that slightly heavier isotopic compositions \n\nare found in samples with higher contents of mineral matter originated from regional dust \n\ndeposition. For the ?15N the correlation to GC1 scores is highly significant (r 0.75) if the upper \n\npeat layer (<60 cm) is excluded. Thus, GC4 accounts for the shared signal of both isotopic ratios \n\nand probably reflects the co-variation in the samples contributing to most of the variance (that of \n\nthe mineral sediment and those of the upper peat section). \n\n As it can be seen in Figure 5 the changes in GC1 scores show a good agreement with the \n\nstratigraphy of PdF-I core. The lowest scores are found at the base of the core and correspond to \n\nthe mineral sediment. The first organic rich horizon (Oa7, 404-298 cm; Figure 1) shows an \n\nincrease in GC1 scores, although the still negative values indicate a predominance of mineral \n\nmatter (as also supported by the high ash content and bulk density and the low content in fibre, \n\nAPPENDIX S). The average C content of this horizon (6.1\u00b12.6%) is exceeded at its base and a \n\npeak at 338-348 cm, reaching up to 10.3% (APPENDIX S). At 298 cm the scores increase \n\nabruptly and remain positive until 198 cm indicating the accumulation of minerogenic peat and \n\nan important decrease in the flux of mineral matter from the catchment. From 198 to 158 cm the \n\nscores decrease again to negative values pointing to an increase in the mineral content (mainly \n\nquartz), with values similar to those of the first organic horizon (404-298 cm). By 158 cm the \n\nscores increase to moderate positive values until 119 cm, corresponding to the start of a second \n\nphase of peat accumulation. After that scores increase sharply to remain stable, at maximum \n\nvalues, until 60 cm; being this section the one with the largest C contents (APPENDIX S). The \n\nupper 60 cm show lower, but still positive, almost constant scores. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5 - Record of factor scores of the four principal components extracted for the geochemical composition of \n\nthe PdF-I core \n \n\n GC2 scores also show agreement with the stratigraphy (Figure 5). Negative scores, \n\nindicative of low contributions of regional dusts, are generally found below 298 cm, except for a \n\npeak at 338-348 cm. The scores remain positive, with small variations, from 298 to 119 cm. At \n\n119 cm they decrease abruptly coinciding with the largest values of GC1 scores and suggesting a \n\ndecrease in the dust flux (local and regional) to the mire. The flux of regional dust recovers in the \n\nupper peat section (<60 cm). \n\n The metal content (GC3 scores) in the PdF-I core is highly irregular below 298 cm; shows \n\nelevated values between 278-230 cm, and generally low values in the upper 230 cm (Figure 5). \n\nDiscrete peaks are found at 388, 348, 210, 158 and 58 cm. Elevated metal concentrations were \n\nfound in peat sections formed under wetter climate conditions (corresponding to cold periods in \n\nthe North Atlantic represented in Figure 6; Bond et al., 2001, as it is discussed below) suggesting \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \n\nthat changing redox conditions linked to variations in water table depth may have been \n\nresponsible for the remobilization and precipitation of the metals. \n\n The isotopic signature of the organic matter captured by GC4 shows high scores at the \n\nbase of the core and in the upper peat sections (Figure 5). The ?13C ratios of the upper peat \n\nsection (APPENDIX S) point to a rapid shift from C3 to C4 vegetation. Small variations are \n\nobserved in the rest of the record, with relatively lower values between 398-220 cm and 119-60 \n\ncm, and relatively higher between 210-130 cm.  \n\n3.3.3 Chronology of the changes \n\n Some selected proxies are represented in Figure 6 to synthesize the chronology of the  \n\n \nFigure 6 - Chronology of Holocene environmental changes recorded in the Pau-de-Fruta mire. GC1 and GC2: \n\nscores of the two first geochemical components extracted with PCA; HSG: standardized hematite-\nstained grains record (original data obtained from BOND et al., 2001) \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n \nchanges occurred during the Holocene in the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional. The figure also \n\ncontains the record of hematite-stained grains (HSG) of the North Atlantic (BOND et al., 2001), \n\nwhich reflects variations in temperature at high northern latitudes. HSG variations were found to \n\nmatch the changes in oxygen isotopic composition of a speleothem collected from Lapa Grande \n\ncave (STR\u00cdKIS et al., 2011), located at the north of the Minas Gerais State \u2013 some 400 km north \n\nof Pau de Fruta mire. Increased contents of HSG are related to colder temperatures in the North \n\nAtlantic and wetter conditions in central-eastern Brazil. The combination of proxies enables to \n\ndefine six main phases of change. \n\n Phase I (?10,000-7360 cal BP, horizon Oa7) represents the start of organic matter \n\naccumulation at the beginning of the Holocene (by ?9500 cal BP). This horizon has a high \n\ncontent in inorganic matter and its geochemical composition indicates a dominance of inputs \n\nfrom the mire\u2019s catchment, pointing to still landscape unstable conditions. A large increase in \n\nregional dust deposition (GC2, Figure 6) occurred by ?8200-8300 cal BP, which coincides with \n\nthe 8.2 ka event, and suggests intense winds. The vegetation was dominated by dense semi-\n\ndeciduous and mountain forests and wet rupicola-saxicolous grasslands, indicating wet and cold \n\nclimate conditions. The start of this phase is coeval with Bond event 6 and its termination with \n\nthe abrupt end of Bond event 5 (Figure 6). Thus the start of organic matter accumulation may \n\nhave been triggered by the increase in humidity in the early Holocene.  \n\n Phase II (?7360-4200 cal BP, horizons Oa6 and Oa5) shows a sharp increase in organic \n\nmatter content, a decrease in the local fluxes of inorganic matter and a relative, almost constant, \n\ndominance of the regional dust component (with the exception of a local decrease by ?4600 cal \n\nBP, Figure 6). A decline in mountain forests and the opening of the semi-deciduous forests with \n\nexpansion of savanna formations suggest warmer conditions and a certain decrease in humidity. \n\nThe abrupt end of Bond event 5 and development of dry conditions agree well with the formation \n\nof the highly sapric (i.e highly decomposed peat) Oa6 horizon. But the HSG record does not \n\npoint to increase humidity (Bond event 4) until ?6000 cal BP, some 600 years after the start of \n\nthe formation of the horizon Oa5 (Figure 6). Also, Bond event 4 ends by ?5200 cal BP with a \n\nreturn to dry conditions, while phase II (and peat horizon Oa5) extended until ?4200 cal BP. \n\nStr\u00edkis et al. (2011) also found that wet events at 6.6 and 7.1 ka detected in the oxygen isotope \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n\nrecord of Lapa Grande did not match the North Atlantic record. These mostly coincide with the \n\ntime frame for the start of the formation of horizon Oa5.  \n\n Phase III (?4200-2200 cal BP, horizons Oa4 and Oa3) is characterized by a large increase \n\nin the flux mineral matter from the catchment, surely related to severe soil erosion, with contents \n\ncomparable to those of horizon Oa7 of phase I (reaching up to 90%, see APPENDIX S). Between \n\n?4200-3800 cal BP the contribution of regional dust was significant, but after ?3800 cal BP the \n\nlocal signal overrode the regional one and the mire evolved to conditions similar to those of the \n\nearly Holocene. The vegetation showed a decline of semi-deciduous forests and expansion of \n\nformations typical of drier conditions. At a local level, frequent fires and perturbations of the \n\ncatchment hydrology are suggested, their intensity being reduced by the end of the phase. The \n\ndecrease in humidity may have been accompanied by increased rainfall seasonality and \n\ntorrentiality, based on a greater diversity of regional pollen types. Most of the phase developed in \n\nthe time period corresponding to Bond events 2 and 3. \n\n Phase IV (?2200-1160 cal BP; horizons Oa2, Oe-i, and Oa) shows a recover to \n\ngeochemical conditions similar to those of phase II (Figure 6), with a decrease in local soil \n\nerosion and increase in regional dust deposition. Vegetation was still dominated by savanna \n\nformations under dry conditions, although periods of punctuated cooling, possibility also \n\naccompanied by variations in humidity, are suggested. This is supported by more frequent \n\nchanges in peat stratigraphy. \n\n Phase V (?1160-400 cal BP, horizon Oi-e) shows the largest increase in organic matter \n\naccumulation and a sharp reduction in local and regional fluxes of mineral matter (Figure 6), \n\npointing to environmental stability in both the catchment and at regional scale. The HSG record \n\nsuggests that the phase may have occurred under dry conditions. \n\n Phase VI (&lt;?400 cal BP, horizon Oi) represents an abrupt shift. At the beginning of the \n\nphase there is a sudden increase in the regional dust signal (the largest of the whole record), \n\ntogether with a moderate increase in the local flux of mineral matter (comparable to phases IV \n\nand II). The C isotopic composition also shows an abrupt change to values typical of C4 plants, \n\nwhile the regional and local pollen indicators recorded large hydrological disturbances and soil \n\nerosion, but also a certain increase in humidity in the last couple of centuries (as indicated by the \n\nslight recover of the humid forests). \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n The phases determined and environmental conditions inferred from the PdF-I record agree \n\nwell with paleoclimatic interpretations obtained from other peat, lake sediments and speleothem \n\nrecords in central Brazil. Cold and humid conditions, as those proposed for phase I in Pau de \n\nFruta, were verified in the isotopic record of Lapa Grande (STR\u00cdKIS et al., 2011). Cold \n\nconditions were also suggested for the period 10,360-8840 cal BP in the Salitre peat record \n\n(LEDRU, 1993), reflected by the presence of Araucaria forests. Wet conditions are supported by \n\nthe predominance of semi-deciduous forests in the record of Lagoa Nova between ca. 9540-8220 \n\ncal BP (BEHLING, 2003), and by the expansion of the gallery forest in Lago do Pires between \n\nca. 9910-8180 cal BP (BEHLING, 1995a). In the later record, the decrease in the abundance of \n\nmountain forest suggests slightly warmer conditions than those of the Bond event 6. A shift to \n\nwetter conditions is also recorded in Lapa Grande (STR\u00cdKIS et al., 2011) during the 8.2 ka event \n\nand Bond event 5. \n\n In phase II the PdF-I record points to a decrease in humidty, with the exception of the \n\nBond event 4. In the Lagoa Nova record there is an expansion of Cerrado formations and \n\nregression of the gallery forest between ca. 7560-6060 cal BP; a sharp decrease in tree pollen and \n\nNPP indicators of wet environments between ca. 6320-4875 cal BP was found in the Salitre \n\nrecord; and drawdowns in lake level with development of a fen phase were found in Lagoa dos \n\nOlhos ca. 7865-7415 cal BP (DE OLIVEIRA, 1992), and Lagoa Santa between 7165-5590 cal BP \n\n(PARIZZI; SALGADO-LABOURIAU; KOHLER, 1998). In Lagoa da Serra Negra, apart from a \n\nreduction in humidity (expansion of Cerrado formations and retreat of semi-deciduous forests), \n\nincreased temperatures are suggested after 5900-5580 cal BP. Phase II also coincides with the \n\nstart of the so called \u201cArchaic Gap\u201d (ARAUJO et al. 2005) in the state of Minas Gerais, a phase \n\nof abandonment of settlements and depopulation that was related to the onset of arid conditions. \n\nIn PdF-I the Bond event 4 is represented by a slight increase in humidity and warmer \n\ntemperatures than in previous events.  \n\n The second half of the \u201cArchaic Gap\u201d period corresponds to phase III of the PdF-I record. \n\nClimate was probably more arid and warmer than in the previous phase, as supported by the low \n\nabundances or absence of pollen types characteristic of forests and humid grasslands and the \n\nincrease in savanna types. A similar situation was inferred in Lagoa Nova ca. 2950-2790 cal BP, \n\nfrom the dominance of Cerrado (savanna) and Cerrad\u00e3o (tree-shrub savanna) formations. \n\nDespite the general arid conditions, in PdF-I two local increases in humidity coincided with Bond \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n \n\nevents 3 and 2. Higher humidity was interpreted in the Salitre record between 4750-3350 cal BP \n\nbased on increased abundance of the semi-deciduous forest, and by the formation of the lake in \n\nLagoa dos Olhos by ca. 4350 cal BP. The second humid pulse was recorded after ca. 3350 cal BP \n\nin Lagoa Santa, reflected by a mosaic of forest and Cerrado formations \u2013 under a sub-humid \n\nclimate. In the Lapa Grande record only Bond event 2 was registered. \n\n In phase IV maximun aridity is suggested by the pollen record of PdF-I, with the largest \n\nexpansion of Cerrad\u00e3o, similar to what has been reconstructed in Lagoa Nova for the same \n\nperiod. Nevertheless, conditions seem not to have been constant as increased humidity and \n\ncooling periods, particularly during Bond event 1, were also inferred. From 1270-970 cal BP in \n\nLagoa da Serra Negra, 1320-1050 cal BP in Lagoa dos Olhos and ca. 1400 BP in Lagoa Santa \u2013\n\nclose to Bond event 1- humidity approached that at present indicating a relative increase.  \n\n No record exists for phase V in Lagoa da Serra Negra and Salitre, due to the presence of \n\nhiatuses. In Lagoa Nova arid conditions, represented by Cerrad\u00e3o formations, continued until \n\n600 cal BP.   \n\n The start of phase VI occurred about a century after the arrival of Portuguese to Brazil and \n\ncoincides with the initiation of gold mining activities (MACHADO; FIGUEIR\u00d4A, 2001). The \n\n17th and 18th centuries CE were known as the \u201cgold cycle\u201d. In 1714 CE the first diamonds were \n\nfound close to the Diamantina city (the origin of its name) and the Pau de Fruta mire. Mining \n\nintensity decreased with time but some activity persisted until today. Since the 18th century CE \n\npopulation has increased abruptly, several roads were built around the mire, deforestation became \n\nextensive, and in 1927 CE a water reservoir for the Diamantina city was constructed at the outlet \n\nof the mire. This increased human impact in the landscape may have been responsible for the \n\nabrupt change indicated by the PdF-I record in phase VI. Despite the enhanced anthropization of \n\nlandscape, climate also showed significant changes as those related to Bond event 0, that may \n\nhave contributed to the abrupt shift from a C3 to a dominant C4 vegetation (Fig. 6) in the Pau de \n\nFruta mire.  \n\n3.3.4 Mire\u2019s behaviour in phase space \n\n Following Dearing (2008), the evolution of Pau de Fruta mire (its system behavior) can be \n\nexamined using a phase space diagram (i.e \u201ca bivariate plot showing the temporal sequence of \n\npoints\u201d). In Figure 7 we have represented the GC1-GC2 projection, that is assumed to show the \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\ncombination of local (GC1) and regional (GC2) signals based on the geochemical composition of \n\nthe peat/sediments of the PdF-I core. Three main states are suggested, the first one (S1) \n\nrepresented by the early Holocene (phase I, ?10,000-7360 cal BP), indicating catchment \n\ninstability with large fluxes of local mineral matter and a low contribution of regional dusts. The \n\nsecond state (S2) occurs under increased stability in the catchment, with lower fluxes of local \n\nmineral matter and enhanced deposition of regional dusts. While the third state (S3) represents \n\nhighly stable local and regional conditions and the largest accumulation of organic matter in Pau \n\nde Fruta.  \n\n \nFigure 7 - Phase space diagram of the two first geochemical components, representing local and regional fluxes of \n\nmineral matter (i.e. stability) to the Pau-de-Fruta mire \n \n\n The graph shows that changes between states have been rather abrupt, as it also happened \n\nduring the 8.2 ka event. The main exception is the evolution of phase III, in which the shift from \n\nS2 seems to have been preceded by a transition (?4200-3800 cal BP) to conditions similar to \n\nthose of the 8.2 ka event, before the abrupt change to S1 occurred. S2 and S3 represent stages of \n\npeat accumulation and peatland development, while S1 seems to reflect phases of large mineral \n\nfluxes from the catchment.  \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \n\n3.4 Conclusions \n\n The multi-proxy investigation of the PdF-I suggests that Holocene environmental \n\nevolution in central-eastern Brazil was mainly linked to climate change. Peat stratigraphy is the \n\nvisual evidence we have today of past changes, and it coincided with the variations found in \n\nvegetation and landscape dynamics. The combination of proxies enabled us to define six main \n\nphases of change: phase I (?10,000-7360 cal BP), II (?7360-4200 cal BP), III (?4200-2200 cal \n\nBP), IV (?2200-1160 cal BP), V (?1160-400 cal BP) and VI (&lt;?400 cal BP). The changes in \n\nvegetation suggested wet and cold (phase I), wet and warm (phase II), dry and warm (phase III), \n\ndry and punctuated cooling (phase IV) conditions until the current sub-humid (phases V-VI) \n\nclimate was set up. Climate changes were accompanied by local (phases I and III) and/or regional \n\n(phases II and IV) reactivations of soil erosion. The 8.2 ka event was clearly identified by a large \n\nincrease in regional dust deposition. Similar conditions to this event were found for the transition \n\nfrom phase II to phase III (4200-3800 cal BP). Reduced local and regional erosion and increased \n\naccumulation of organic matter were reconstructed for phase V.  \n\n Changes in PdF-I peat stratigraphy and the detected episodes of local erosion were \n\nprobably related to intense hydrological changes in the mire catchment, that correlate \n\nchronologically with climate variations in the North Atlantic; in agreement with findings by \n\nStr\u00edkis et al. (2011) that demonstrate that Holocene abrupt variations in monsoon precipitation in \n\ncentral-eastern Brazil were in pace with Bond events. But, although climate was the most \n\nimportant driving force of environmental change, human activity seems to have been also \n\ninvolved in the dramatic change occurred over the past 400 years (phase VI). These included \n\nmining activities, as the \u201cgold cycle\u201d during the 17th and 18th centuries CE and the extraction of \n\ndiamonds since 1714 CE until today; abrupt increase in population, construction of roads around \n\nthe mire and extensive deforestation since the 18th century CE, and construction of a water \n\nreservoir for Diamantina city at the outlet of the mire in 1927 CE.  \n\n The temporal sequence of the evolution of the local and regional erosion proxies suggests \n\nthat the Pau de Fruta mire had three main states reflecting conditions of local landscape \n\ninstability (in phase I) or stability (in phases III, IV and VI) in the mire catchment; with \n\ntransitional conditions during the 8.2 ka event and most of phase III. During the phases of \n\nstability there was enhanced deposition of regional dusts, except for phase V which reflects the \n\nmore stable conditions through out the Holocene.  \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n Our work indicates that mountain tropical peatlands are ideal archives for the \n\nreconstruction of Holocene climate change, in particular if a multi-proxy approach is applied.  \n\nReferences \n\nARAUJO, A.G.M.; NEVES, W.A.; PIL\u00d3, L.B.; ATUI, J.P.V.

Furthermore, within South America \nprecipitation variations were found to be in phase between southern Brazil and western \nAmazonia, while these regions are out of phase with northeastern Brazil and eastern Amazonia, \nbeing orbital-scale variability proposed as the main direct force resulting from changes in Austral \nsummer insolation (ASI). Here we present stable isotopes, geochemical and pollen records of a \ncore sampled in a tropical mountain mire from central-eastern Brazil, spanning the last ~60 kyr. \nPrecipitation in the area is associated to the intensity of the South American monsoon system \n(SAMS) and the current sub-humid climate allows the presence of Cerrado biome (savanna). We \ninfer that the precipitation pattern from central-eastern Brazil from ~60 to ~26 cal kyr BP was out \nof phase with western Amazonia and southern Brazil and in phase with northeastern Brazil. From \n~26 to ~17 cal kyr BP the area was out of phase with western Amazonia, southern and \nnortheastern Brazil. Since ~17 cal kyr BP to the present, the precipitation pattern became in phase \nwith the latter region. This reflects that even under the dominant control of millennial-scale \nvariations, summer solar radiation possibly played a more significant role during these last ~17 \nkyr, with humid climate during low summer insolation phases. Precipitation changes were also \naccompanied by changes in temperature and soil stability in the mire's catchment (local erosion). \nCurrent climate and vegetation of Cerrado biome is relatively recent, probably establishing after \n3.3 cal kyr BP, but similar conditions may have been present in some time of MIS 3(60-27.8 cal \nkyr BP).  \n\nKeywords: Peatlands; Late Pleistocene; Precipitation model; Central-eastern Brazil; Pollen; \nGeochemistry \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\n Colder (stadials) and warmer periods (interstadials) alternated on timescales of several \n\nmillennia over the course of the last ice age, as demonstrated by ice-core records from Greenland \n\n(GROOTES; STUIVER, 1997; SVENSSON et al., 2008) and sediment cores from the North \n\nAtlantic (BOND et al., 1993; MARTRAT et al., 2007).  \n\n The Heinrich (H) events are defined by distinct layers of coarse grain material in the \n\nNorth Atlantic sediments, spaced at irregular intervals of ~10,000 years, which were identified as \n\nice rafted debris, i.e., material carried by massive episodic iceberg discharges into the ocean \n\noriginated from instabilities of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (HEINRICH, 1988; \n\nCLAUSSEN et al., 2003). The Dansgaard-Oeschger (D/O) cycles are characterized by an abrupt \n\nwarming of some 5\u201310 \u00baK in the Greenland and North Atlantic region within a few years or \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n \n\ndecades, occurring approximately every 1500 years (DANSGAARD et al., 1993; VAN \n\nKREVELD et al. 2000; CLAUSSEN et al., 2003). The abrupt warming is followed by a gradual \n\ncooling over several hundreds or thousands of years, before the cooling ends with an abrupt drop \n\nof temperatures to stadial conditions. Therefore, in most cases Heinrich events are followed by a \n\nparticularly warm D/O event, and successive D/O events tend to become progressively cooler \n\nuntil the next Heinrich event starts (CLAUSSEN et al., 2003).  \n\n  Several records from South America have shown the millennial-scale shifts (WANG et \n\nal., 2004; CRUZ et al., 2005; CHENG et al., 2013) corresponding to Younger Dryas (YD)-H \n\nevents and D/O cycles. During them the Southern Hemisphere was in anti-phase with the \n\nNorthern hemisphere counterparts such as changes in Asian monsoon (WANG et al., 2008), \n\nGreenland temperature (SVENSSON et al., 2008) and the Cariaco Basin records (PETERSON, et \n\nal., 2000), and in phase with speleothem records from southern (CRUZ et al., 2005; WANG et \n\nal., 2006) and northeastern Brazil (WANG et al., 2004; CRUZ et al., 2009) and high altitude \n\ncentral Peruvian Andes (KANNER, et al., 2012), and the Lake Titicaca record (BAKER et al., \n\n2001). The interhemispheric anti-phase nature of these events supports the notion that the YD-H \n\nand D/O events manifest in South America as wet and dry episodes, respectively (CHENG et al., \n\n2013). The abrupt increase in monsoon rainfall during the YD-H events is likely related to a \n\nsouthward shift in the average position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a \n\nstrengthening of the asymmetry in Hadley circulation in response to an interhemispheric gradient \n\nof sea surface temperature and to some extent a possible influence from Antarctic climate \n\nchanges (WANG et al., 2004, 2006; KANNER, et al., 2012; CHENG et al., 2013).  \n\n According to Cheng et al. (2013), although the millennial-scale precipitation variability \n\nacross tropical South America shows a highly coherent pattern, the spatial structure of \n\nprecipitation is complex at orbital timescales. These authors claim that this is evident from the \n\ncomparison of existing speleothem ?18O records from southern (CRUZ et al., 2005) and \n\nnortheastern (CRUZ et al., 2009) Brazil with speleothem records from western and eastern \n\nAmazonia. The western Amazonia and southern Brazil ?18O variations are broadly in-phase, \n\nreflecting changes in the South American monsoon system (SAMS) intensity (VUILLE et al., \n\n2003; VUILLE; WERNER, 2005; CRUZ et al., 2005) resulting from changes in Austral summer \n\ninsolation (ASI) associated with the precession cycle (CRUZ et al., 2005). In addition, they are \n\nanti-phased with their NH counterparts, the Asian monsoon (WANG et al., 2008; CHENG et al., \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\n2012), supporting the notion that increased summer solar radiation is the most effective factor \n\nstrengthening tropical\u2013subtropical monsoons (KUTZBACH et al., 2008; CHENG et al., 2012). \n\nThe western Amazonia and southern Brazil speleothem records are, however, out of phase with \n\nspeleothem records from northeastern Brazil and eastern Amazonia (CHENG et al., 2013).  \n\n In central-eastern Brazil, sub-humid and seasonal climate with well-defined seasons (~4-5 \n\nmonths of dry season and mean winter temperature ? 15\u00b0C) maintain the Cerrado biome, a vast \n\ntropical savanna that is part of the so-called corridor of \u201cxeric vegetation\u2019\u2019 (BUCHER, 1982), \n\nmainly represented by gramineous-savanna (Campo Limpo Seco), savanna forest-shrubs \n\n(Cerrado T\u00edpico; ~50-20% canopy cover, ~5 m height and crooked trunks) and savanna forest \n\n(Cerrad\u00e3o; ~50% canopy cover and ~9 m height). Although, other phytophysionomies as semi-\n\ndeciduous forest (Floresta Semidecidua), mountain forest (Floresta Montana) and wet grasslands \n\n(Campo Limpo \u00damido) are also seen occuring as relicts of wetter climates (ABSY et al., 1991; \n\nFERRAZ-VICENTINI; SALGADO-LABOURIAU, 1996; LEDRU et al., 1996) and as indicative \n\nof long-term climate variability during the Quaternary.  \n\n Tropical and subtropical peatlands have a large potential for the reconstruction of \n\nPleistocene climate changes (WEISS et al., 2002; MULLER et al., 2008; LEDRU; \n\nMOURGUIART; RICCOMINI, 2009; DOMMAIN; COUWENBERG; JOOSTEN, 2011; \n\nDALEY et al., 2012; MARGALEF, et al., 2013), since they are ecosystems extremely sensitive \n\nto changes in hydrology. Therefore, here we investigated a core sampled in a tropical mountain \n\npeatland from the central-eastern Brazil, located in Minas Gerais State (Brazil) within the Serra \n\ndo Espinha\u00e7o Meridional. In this area, rainfall is associated to the intensity of the SAMS. Its \n\nlocation is ideal since it is within the boundaries of oscilation of the SACZ. On the other hand, \n\nthe multi-proxy approach used (stable isotopes, geochemical and pollen records), besides rainfall \n\nvariations (dry and wet events), it also provides information on temperature, landscape stability \n\nand vegetation changes.  \n\n4.2 Material and Methods \n\n4.2.1 Sampling and stratigraphic description \n\n A core of 324 cm in length (APPENDIX V) was collected in Pinheiro mire (PI core), a \n\ntropical mountain peatland within the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional (Figure 1). Sampling was \n\ndone in 2010 using a vibracore. \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 - Long-term mean (A.D. 1979-2000) precipitation (mm) for December-February (DJF) from the Climate \n\nPrediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation. Numbers on the map indicate the study site and \nother climate records from South America: 1 - Pinheiro mire in Minas Gerais State, central-eastern \nBrazil; 2 - Rio Grande do Norte caves in Rio Grande do Norte State, northeastern Brazil (CRUZ et al., \n2009); 3 - Botuver\u00e1 cave in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil (CRUZ et al., 2005); 4 - western \nAmazonia caves, northern Peru (CHENG et al., 2013). ITCZ - Intertropical Convergence Zone; SACZ - \nSouth Atlantic Convergence Zone; LLJ - low-level jet     \n\n  \n\n The current climate is tropical mountainous with an average annual precipitation of 1500 \n\nmm and vegetation belonging to the Cerrado biome. Wet grasslands (Campo Limpo \u00damido) and \n\nrupicola-saxicolous grassland (Campo Rupestre) are the current phytophysionomies on the \n\ncollection site. The study area is well situated for investigating past changes in precipitation, \n\nbecause monsoon rainfall depends on the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), one of the \n\nmain features of SAMS, as well as the ITCZ and the low-level jet (LLJ). \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\n The present soil is classified as a Hemic Haplosaprists (SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2010) \n\nand the basal lithology corresponds to the Galho do Miguel formation (Paleo-Mesoproterozoic), \n\nconstituted by pure and thin quartzites (~90%) and thin micaceous quartzites and gray or greenish \n\nmetargilites (~5 a 10%). The stratigraphy of the core (APPENDIX V) was described according to \n\nField Book for Describing and Sampling Soils (SCHOENEBERGER et al., 2012), whereas the \n\nhorizons/layers were defined according to Soil Taxonomy (SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2010). \n \n\n4.2.2 Elemental and isotopic composition \n\n Carbon and N contents and isotopic composition (?\n13C and ?\n\n15N) were determined in \n\ndried, milled and homogenized samples of 2 cm in thickness, using an elemental analyzer \n\ncoupled to a mass spectrometer hosted at the Laborat\u00f3rio de Ecologia Isot\u00f3pica of the Centro de \n\nEnergia Nuclear na Agricultura - CENA/USP (Piracicaba, SP, Brasil). Major, minor and trace \n\nelements (S, Al, Si, Fe, Ti, K, Ga, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Th, Cr,  Pb and Br) were determined by X-\n\nray fluorescence using two energy dispersive XRF analyzers (CHEBURKIN; SHOTYK, 1996; \n\nWEISS; CHEBURKIN; SHOTYK, 1998) hosted at the RIAIDT facility (Infrastructure Network \n\nfor the Support of Research and Technological Development) of the University of Santiago de \n\nCompostela (Spain). The instruments were calibrated using several reference materials. \n\nDetections limits for organic matrices are:&lt;0.01% for Al, Si, S, K and Fe; 0.0005% for Ti; 1 \n\n?g\u00b7 g-1 for Cr, Br, Ga, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Th, Pb and Nb. Detection limits for mineral matrices are: \n\n0.1% for Al; 0.05% for Si; 0.04% for K; 0.01% for Fe; 0.004% for S; 0.002% for Ti; 1 ?g g-1 for \n\nCr, Br, Ga, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Th, Pb and Nb. \n\n4.2.3 Pollen study  \n\n Physico-chemical treatment for the extraction of pollen, spores and other non-pollen \n\npalynomorphs (NPP) followed the procedure described in Ybert et al. (1992), using an ultrasound \n\nto separate large organic remains. Samples correspond to sections of 1 cm in thickness taken \n\nevery 10 cm. Counting was done at 40 X under the microscope. Identification was aided by a \n\nreference collection of the Pau de Fruta mire (also located in Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Meridional) \n\nhosted at the laboratory of N\u00facleo de Pesquisa em Palinologia do Instituto de Bot\u00e2nica do Estado \n\nde S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), identification keys and atlases (VAN GEEL, 1978; TRYON; TRYON, \n\n1982; ROUBIK; MORENO, 1991). Taxa included in the land pollen sum (TLP) are considered to \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n \n\nbe indicators of the regional vegetation, while hydro-hygrophytes and NPP are considered to \n\nmainly provide a local signal. Nevertheless, we have to remind that some hydro-hygrophytes may \n\nalso be part of regional communities, as for example the Cyperaceae. The opposite may occur \n\nwith Poaceae and Ericaceae, which are considered as regional components although they can also \n\nbe present in local communities. Environmental requirements for regional taxa follow those \n\ndescribed by Mendon\u00e7a et al. (1998) and Marchant et al. (2002), and hydro-hygrophytes, \n\npteridophytes and NPP by van Geel (1978) and van Geel; Coope; van Der Hammen (1989). Main \n\noccuring environments of some pollen types observed in the Pinheiro mire can be checked in \n\nAPPENDICES L and M referring to the pollen types observed in the Pau de Fruta mire. Pollen \n\ndiagrams were done using TILIA software (GRIMM, 1992).  \n\n4.2.4 Radiocarbon age dating and age/depth model \n\n Thirteen samples were radiocarbon dated by AMS in the Beta Analytic Inc. (Miami, \n\nUSA). The results were calibrated using SHCal04.14C calibration curve (REIMER et al., 2009). \n\nHowever, only six samples belonging to the first 101 cm were used for model construction \n\n(APPENDIX W), because below this depth all ages were unexpectedily young. Similar situations \n\nwere found in Pleistocene layers of other peat deposits from the Southern Hemisphere (WEISS et \n\nal., 2002; MARGALEF et al., 2013). The cause is still unknown, but VOELKER et al. (2000) \n\nfound highly increased concentrations of 14C for the period 27 to 54 kyr, coincident with low \n\npaleomagnetic filed intensities, which results in apparently young ages for the period. Another \n\nprocess that could have affeted the 14C content of the peat is methane formation and relased, since \n\nmethane-C has a very low ?13C value (~-60\u2030; CHARMAN et al., 1999) and may result in an \n\nenrichment in 13C and 14C in the remaining material (peat) (Peter Buurman, personal \n\ncommunication). The age-depth model was obtained using the Clam.R application developed by \n\nBlaauw (2010); the best fit was obtained with a smooth-spline solution. Below 101 cm all ages \n\nare extrapolated from the model and thus are subjected to larger uncertainties. \n\n4.2.5 Statistical analysis \n\n Stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis (total sum of squares method; GRIMM, \n\n1987) was applied to pollen and hydro-hygrophyte, pteridophytes and NPP data to define \n\nregional and local palynological zones, as well as to most representative environmental and \n\nphytophysionomies indicators. For geochemical data, principal components analysis (PCA) was \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nperformed on log-transformed and standardized values, on correlation mode and applying a \n\nvarimax rotation to maximize the loadings of the variables in the components (ERIKSSON et al., \n\n1999). PCA was done using SPSS 20.0 software.  \n\n4.3 Results and discussion \n\n4.3.1 Selection of proxies  \n\n The factor loadings for the three components and fractionation of communalities of the \n\nvariables used in the PCA of geochemical properties are provided in APPENDIX X, and the \n\ncomplete pollen diagrams for the regional and local taxa and NPP in APPENDICES Y and Z. \n\nHere the results and discussion are supported by proxies that offered the most accurate \n\npalaeoenvironmental information: ?13C, ?15N, Cp2 (factor scores of the second component of \n\nPCA geochemical properties) and Br/C ratio (Figure 2), as well as representative environment \n\nindicators and phytophysionomies determined by pollen analysis (Figure 3; environmental \n\nrequirements followed the bibliographies aforementioned and APPENDICES L, M, Y and Z). \n\n The ?13C values allow to identify carbon derived from different photosynthetic pathways, \n\nsince isotopic ratio does not change with time (CERLING et al., 1989). Thus, this ratio can be \n\nused to inform on source vegetation and climate dynamics, because C3 plants (most trees and \n\nsome graminoides of wet grasslands and indicators of humid environments) have ?13C values \n\nbetween -32 and -22\u2030, and C4 plants (graminoides of dry environments) between -17 and -9\u2030 \n\n(BOUTTON, 1991; O\u2019LEARY, 1988).   \n\n The main factors affeting the ?15N ratio are: (i) the constant addition of organic matter \n\nfrom plants in the upper soil layers; (ii) the transformations of organic-N to inorganic-N, and \n\namong inorganic-N forms. With increased mineralization the remaining organic matter becomes \n\nenriched in atoms 15N. In general, these processes occur during drier periods. In tropical soils the \n\nvalues vary between +3.5 and +21.7\u2030, with much smaller variations in hydromorphic soils \n\n(between ?+4 and +5\u2030) (MARTINELLI et al., 2009).  \n\n The second component of PCA on geochemical properties, Cp2 (APPENDIX X) is \n\ncharacterized by positive loadings of C, N and S (biophyllic elements) and Br (organically bound \n\nelement) and negative loadings of Si, Cr and K (lithogenic elements). Since the main geological \n\nmaterial of the catchment of the mire is quartzite, Si contents are most probably related to the \n\namount of quartz transported from the catchment soils to the mire. Thus, Cp2 is likely to reflect a \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n \n\nlocal signal: under stable conditions in the catchment the mire accumulates organic matter \n\n(positive factor scores), while under unstable conditions (erosion episodes) larger amounts of \n\ncoarse mineral matter (i.e. quartz from the quartzite) are transported to the mire (negative factor \n\nscores).  \n\n The main source of Br is the oceans. It reaches the soils by wet precipitation and it \n\naccumulates as organo-halogenated compounds (BIESTER; MART\u00cdNEZ CORTIZAS; \n\nKEPPLER, 2006). Given the inland location of the Pinheiro mire Br deposition may have been \n\nlinked to atmospheric circulations bringing sea-spray and precipitation (LALOR, 1995). The \n\nBr/C ratio is used here to reflect the excess of Br that can not be explained by a substrate effect \n\n(i.e. availability of organic matter), and thus to infer changes in rainfall.   \n\n In Figure 2 we have also included the ?18O curve from Greenland ice record (GROOTES; \n\nSTUIVER, 1997), showing the typical sequence of stadials (H-YD) and interstadials (D/O) \n\nevents. For comparison we also included ?18O records of speleothems from northeastern (CRUZ \n\net al., 2009) and southern Brazil (CRUZ et al., 2005), and Western Amazon (CHENG et al., \n\n2013), as well as the ASI curve (BERGER, 1978). The oxygen isotope ratios are mainly \n\ninterpreted as a function of the isotopic composition of rainfall, therefore as indicative of past \n\nprecipitation conditions, with ?18O being inversely proportional to the relative changes in \n\nprecipitation amounts (CRUZ et al., 2009), i.e., more negative values indicate wetter \n\nenvironments and less negative drier environments. \n\n4.3.2 Chronological reconstruction of environmental dynamics \n\n The PI record reflects predominant dry conditions (?13C values >21.4\u2030) between ~60 and \n\n~27.8 cal kyr BP, interrupted by several excursions to, possibly, more humid conditions (Figure \n\n2). This phase coincides with the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3), one of NH cold period, and \n\nalso with the absence of speleothem formation in northeastern Brazil (CRUZ et al., 2009 - Fig. \n\n2C; WANG et al., 2004). The 17, 16, 15, 12, 8, 7, 5, 4 and 3 D/O cycles are represented in the PI \n\nrecord by increasing ?13C values (up to -18.9\u2030) which may be related to the presence of a long \n\ndry season (5 months or more), mainly in 12, 7 and 5 D/O cycles (~44.7, ~36 and ~31.6 cal kyr \n\nBP, respectively). High rates of organic matter mineralization (increased ?15N values; Figure \n\n2A2) and erosion in the catchment (more negative Cp2 values; Figure 2A3) were due to a low \n\nsoil protection by the retraction of semi-deciduous forest and expansion of pioneer trees (Figure  \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2 - Comparison among South America records over the past 60 kyr BP.

Some periods of milder climate conditions with relative increased in humidity (but still with a \n\nshorter, dry season, possibly 2 to 3 months) are seen in ~60-57.7, ~51.7-45.8, ~43.6-39.2, and \n\n~34.9-33.2 cal kyr BP. The first three periods overlap with H6, H5 and H4 events, while the latter \n\npreceded the H3 event in ~2.1 kyrs. High oceanic-atmospheric activity and precipitation in the \n\nthird period (~43.6-39.2 cal kyr BP) are inferred by higher Br/C ratios (except during 10 D/O \n\ncycle; Figure 2A4), which suggests higher humidity during MIS 3. Given these fluctuations a \n\ndryer climate is reconstructed for the period ~39.2 to ~27.8 cal kyr BP than from ~60 to ~39.2 cal \n\nkyr BP; while colder conditions seem to have occurred in the first half and short-duration cooling \n\nevents in the second half of MIS 3.  \n\n With the beginning of the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) by ~27.8 cal kyr BP, a new \n\npattern of climate conditions was established, which remained until mid-Holocene (6.6 cal kyr \n\nBP). Predominant wet conditions are supported by almost constant low ?13C values, and cold \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nconditions are reflected by the pollen data (presence of cold and humid forest), during H2, H1 \n\nand YD (~25.1, ~16.4 and ~11.5 cal kyr BP, respectively), as well as during the 8.2 cal kyr BP \n\nevent. Erosion in the catchment increased during wet phases, but was relatively lower than during \n\nMIS 3 probably due to a denser tree-shrub vegetation cover (increasing ?15N values suggesting a \n\ngreater accumulation of organic material). The increase in humidity shown by the PI core from \n\n~27.8 to ~18 cal kyr BP was simultaneous to a decrease in northeastern and an increase in \n\nsouthern Brazil. An abrupt change to dry and very cold conditions is recorded by ~17 cal kyr BP \n\n(highest % of Drimys and presence of Araucaria; APPENDIX Y), probably reflecting the H1 \n\nevent. Whereas from ~16.4 to ~7.1 cal kyr BP, there was a return to humid conditions at the same \n\ntime rainfall increased in northeastern and decreased in southern Brazil and western Amazonia. \n\nThe B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interstadial is simultaneous to the 1 D/O cycle and it is registered in the PI \n\nrecord by a slight reduction of precipitation by ~13.7 cal kyr BP, synchronous to the phase with \n\nabsence of speleothem formation in northeastern and wet climate conditions in southern Brazil \n\n(Figure 2). The highest Br/C ratio of the PI core is recorded by ~8.2 cal kyr BP, providing \n\nevidence of the wettest period ocurred in central-eastern Brazil, as it was also proposed for \n\nnortheastern Brazil (Figure 2). \n\n Between the mid- and late-Holocene, from ~6.6 to ~3.3 cal kyr BP, the decline of semi-\n\ndeciduous, cold and humid and mountain forest and the expansion of dry grassland point to a \n\ndecrease in hummidity, while an almost constant presence of wet grassland indicates a certain \n\ndegree of humidity, most likely around and within the mire, as supported by the lowest ?13C \n\nvalues (lowest value of -24.1\u2030 in ~3.3 cal kyr BP). After the ~5.5 cal kyr BP, climate turn to \n\nvery dry (long dry season of ~6 months) and, probably, with periods of torrential rainfall despite \n\nthe warm regional climate. The latter is consistent with the highest abundance of indicators of \n\nshallow open water in the mire (Figure 3) -the concentrated precipitation may have led to excess \n\nrunoff and increased accumulation of water at the surface of the mire. The large decrease in the \n\nBr/C ratio, like those observed during MIS 3, supports the interpretation of a dry climate. During \n\nthis period humidity also decreased in northeastern Brazil, while it increased in southern Brazil \n\nand western Amazonia.  \n\n ?13C abruptly changed by ~3.3 cal kyr BP, the ratio reaching a maximum by ~800 AD. \n\nThese values are comparable to those of MIS 3 and reflect a similar dry vegetation, although \n\nclimate was probably warmer climate (expansion and stabilization of savanna forest). A slight \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n \n\nrecover of semi-deciduous, mountain and pioneer trees indicates a relative increase in humidity at \n\nregional scale, whereas the decline of wet grassland and the slight increase of dry grassland and \n\nmineralization of organic matter (?15N, Figure 2) evidence a decrease in humidity at local scale. \n\nThe trend to current climate conditions probably started at that point, with a strengthening of \n\nseasonality and low frequency of torrential rainfalls, allowing the establishment of Cerrado \n\nBiome (dry season ~4-5 months). Semi-arid conditions are stablished in northeastern Brazil, \n\nwhile southern Brazil and western Amazonia returned to humid and very humid climate, \n\nrespectively, as that of today.   \n\n The last 800 years exhibit almost imperceptible changes suggesting a climate similar to \n\nthe previous period. However, all phytophysionomies continued to decrease until the end of the \n\nphase, while dry grassland had small increase. Beyond the climatic factor, we must also take into \n\naccount the impacts caused by the increase of population after the arrival of European settlers in \n\nthe region recorded during the last 500 years. Impacts of mining activities are visible with peak in \n\nthe 17th and 18th centuries CE in a period known as \u201cgold cycle\u201d; however, deforestation and \n\nconstruction of many roads have been increasingly frequent, mainly to meet the needs of the steel \n\nindustries.   \n\n4.3.3 Precipitation controls during the last ~60 kyr in central-eastern Brazil  \n\n The large reduction in humidity in our study site during MIS 3 coincided with the \n\nexpansion of sea-ice cover and very low temperatures in northern hemisphere (WOLFF et al., \n\n2010; GROOTES; STUIVER, 1997; DANSGAARD et al, 1993; HEINRICH, 1988; Figure 2B): \n\nThese conditions resulted in a southward displacement of the ITCZ and, consequently, also of the \n\nSACZ, leading to increased monsoon rainfall mainly in southern Brazil. The northerly limit of \n\nthe SACZ was probably south of our area, more than several hundred kilometers south of its \n\npresent northerly limit (Figure 1). Millennial-scale precipitation variability is the dominant \n\ncontrol in MIS 3, but in certain periods increased precipitation was also possibly related to the \n\nstrengthening of the SAMS due to high summer insolation, mainly in the second and third period \n\nof mild climate (Figure 2), apparently in phase between ?13C values and ASI.    \n\n It is known that during the last precession cycle strong convective activity and upward \n\nmotion resulted in enhanced condensational heating over the western Amazon Basin. This \n\ncoincided with high ASI, which in turn intensified the upper-tropospheric Nordeste low and \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nresulted in large-scale subsidence and humidity reduction over eastern equatorial South America \n\n(CRUZ et al., 2009). This is the east-west dipole-like pattern of precipitation changes, also called \n\nof South American precipitation dipole (SAPD) (CHENG et al., 2013). It seems to be present in \n\nthe PI record after the ~17.0 cal kyr BP event, followed by the same trend in northeastern Brazil, \n\nincluding antiphase with ASI. Since then, increased precipitation related to insolation occurred in \n\nperiods of weak monsoon season when the ASI was low. However, it is not yet clear if orbital-\n\nscale variability was the dominant control on precipitation; after the H1 and YD events, abrupt \n\nincreases in temperature in the NH most likely caused changes in the Atlantic meridional \n\noverturning circulation and a displacement of SACZ to northward positions, leading to increased \n\nrainfall in central-eastern.   \n\n The SAPD can be probably applied to LGM (~27.8-18.9 cal kyr BP), with some \n\nconsistency as seen in the records of the other regions; although in our study area precipitation \n\nwas in phase (increased precipitation when ASI was high). However, we must also consider the \n\nmillennial-scale precipitation variability, because in this period temperatures in the NH had \n\nalready started to increase slightly. Thus, whether orbital and millennial-scale precipitation \n\nvariability was simultaneously influenced by these factor or only by one them, is still difficult to \n\ndetermined.  \n\n4.4 Conclusions \n\n The precipitation pattern of central-eastern Brazil from ~60 to ~26 cal kyr BP seems to \n\nhave been out of phase with western Amazonia and southern Brazil and in phase with \n\nnortheastern Brazil; while from ~26 to ~17 cal kyr BP it was out of phase with western \n\nAmazonia, southern and northeastern Brazil. Since ~17 cal kyr BP to the present, the \n\nprecipitation pattern became in phase with the latter region. This reflects that even under the \n\ndominant control of millennial-scale variations, summer insolation possibly played a more \n\nsignificant role during these last ~17 kyr, with humid climate during low summer insolation \n\nperiods.  \n\n Precipitation changes were also accompanied by changes in temperature and stability of \n\nthe catchment (local erosion): from ~60 to 39.2 cal kyr BP there were variations from sub-humid \n\nto dry climate amid colder than today, and high landscape instability in the mire's catchment; \n\n~39.2-27.8 cal kyr BP, dry and warm with cooling events and still landscape instability; ~27.8-\n\n\n\n94 \n \n\n \n\n16.4 cal kyr BP wet and ~16.4-6.6 cal kyr BP very wet, both very cold and with reduced \n\nlandscape instability; ~6.6-3.3 cal kyr BP, very dry and warm with increasing catchment \n\ninstability;&lt;3.3 cal kyr BP, from dry and warm to sub-humid climate.  \n\n  Current sub-humid climate and vegetation of Cerrado biome is relatively recent, probably \n\nestablishing after ~3.3 cal kyr BP, but similar conditions may have been present in MIS 3. Today \n\nsemi-deciduous forest, mountain forest and wet grasslands are relicts from wetter climate, since \n\nthey were much more developed in previous phases (especially between ~27.8 and ~6.6 cal kyr \n\nBP). \n\n Pinheiro mire certainly contains a sensitive record in comparison to other studied before, \n\nmainly due to its location which enabled to capture the constant fluctuation and displacement of \n\nthe SACZ. Another factor to be considered is the potential of peatlands in storing information not \n\nonly regarding the changes in precipitation, but also in temperature, vegetation changes and \n\nlandscape stability. \n\nReferences \n\nABSY, M.L.; CLEEF, A.; FOURNIER, M.; MARTIN, L.; SERVANT, M.; SIFFEDINE, A.; \nFERREIRA DA SILVA, M.; SOUBI\u00c8S, F.; SUGUIO, K.; TURCQ, B.; VAN DER HAMMEN, \nT.
