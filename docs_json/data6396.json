T o study the variability of the water volume transport of the Canary Current, CTD and LADCP data of various RAPROCAN cruises were processed, from February 2006 to December 2012. The 18 CTD stations go from 18.5\u00b0-15.5\u00b0W at latitude 29\u00b020'N and from that point on until [28\u00b040'N, 13\u00b0W], through the Fuerteventura-Lanzarote strait. The water mass characteristics were derived from the CTD data, as well as the geostrophic velocities, computed through the thermal wind equation. These velocities were then adjusted through the LADCP drawn reference velocities in order to obtain temporal and spatial variability of the volume transport of the Canary Current. We found a clear difference between the variability of the main branch of this current and the branch flowing through the Lanzarote Passage - the Canary Upwelling Current. The transport of the latter current varies throughout the RAPROCAN cruises approximately between [-3.9; 0.3] Sv, where positive values represent northward transport. A seasonal inversion of this flow of both thermocline and intermediate waters was identified. The southward transport of the main branch of the Canary Current fluctuates between [-6.1; -1] Sv, with the strongest transport taking place in August and the weakest in February 2007. Finally, a comparison between the Canary Current and the upper midocean transport variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation was done. It showed an evident correlation between the upper mid-ocean transport and the Canary Upwelling Current.\nCanary Current, volume transport and variability, LADCP, UMO.\nResumo\nA Corrente das Can\u00e1rias pode ser dividida num ramo principal que flui atrav\u00e9s do arquip\u00e9lago das Can\u00e1rias e um ramo secund\u00e1rio que flui entre as ilhas mais orientais das Can\u00e1rias e entre a costa noroeste de \u00c1frica. Para estudar a variabilidade do transporte de volume de \u00e1gua da Corrente das Can\u00e1rias, os dados CTD e LADCP de v\u00e1rios cruzeiros RAPROCAN foram processados, desde Fevereiro de 2006 a Dezembro de 2012. As 18 esta\u00e7\u00f5es CTD desses cruzeiros v\u00e3o de 18.5\u00b0-15.5\u00b0W \u00e0 latitude 29\u00b020'N e desse ponto em diante, at\u00e9 [28\u00b040'N, 13\u00b0W], atrav\u00e9s do estreito de Fuerteventura-Lanzarote. O ramo secund\u00e1rio da Corrente das Can\u00e1rias passa entre as ilhas orientais do arquip\u00e9lago e a Costa noroeste de \u00c1frica (em ingl\u00eas: Lanzarote Passage - LP). Este ramo foi denominado de Corrente de Afloramento das Can\u00e1rias (Canary Upwelling Current - CUC (Pelegr\u00ed et al., 2006)) e faz tamb\u00e9m parte do estudo realizado nesta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o.\nO Giro Subtropical do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (GSAN) \u00e9 composto pelas seguintes principais correntes: a Corrente Equatorial Norte a Sul, a Corrente do Golfo no bordo ocidental, a Corrente dos A\u00e7ores a Norte e a Corrente das Can\u00e1rias (CC) no bordo oriental. Este giro anticicl\u00f3nico \u00e9 induzido, em conjunto com a for\u00e7a de Coriolis, pelo campo dos ventos al\u00edseos em torno de 20\u00b0N de latitude e pelos ventos de oeste ao redor dos 40\u00b0N. Na maior parte da sua extens\u00e3o o GSAN est\u00e1 em balan\u00e7o geostr\u00f3fico, excepto nos bordos ocidental e oriental da bacia oce\u00e2nica, onde outros processos f\u00edsicos se tornam progressivamente mais importantes. A corrente do bordo oriental come\u00e7ou a ter um maior interesse para a comunidade cient\u00edfica apenas nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas devido ao seu envolvimento na variabilidade da circula\u00e7\u00e3o termohalina meridional do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (do ingl\u00eas: Meridional Overturning Circulation - MOC).\nCorrente das Can\u00e1rias esteja relacionada com a MOC atrav\u00e9s do campo local do rotacional do vento, motivo pelo qual se torna muito importante estudar o transporte da CC e a sua variabilidade. Estudos anteriores mostram que, para as camadas superiores da Corrente das Can\u00e1rias, o transporte resultante de Setembro de 2003 \u00e9 de -4.7 \u00b1 0.8 Sv e para a Corrente de Afloramento das Can\u00e1rias \u00e9 de 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 Sv. Outros estudos indicam que no Outono o transporte da termoclina \u00e9 de -4.5 \u00b1 1.2 Sv no caso da CC e de 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 Sv no caso da CUC, embora em 2009 o transporte da CC fosse mais forte e enquanto o da CUC estava mais fraco. No Inverno estes valores s\u00e3o ainda mais baixos, com um transporte de -1.7 \u00b1 1.0 Sv no ramo principal da corrente, e de 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 Sv no ramo secund\u00e1rio. Para o Ver\u00e3o, outros estudos indicam uma Corrente de Afloramento das Can\u00e1rias mais forte e direccionada para sul: -2.4 \u00b1 0.1 Sv. Num estudo onde foram analisados dados de nove anos no LP, o transporte mais intenso verificou-se no Inverno com -1.3 \u00b1 1.3 Sv, mas esta invers\u00e3o da CUC nem sempre acontece, por vezes ocorre mais cedo, no Outono.\nAp\u00f3s esta breve introdu\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a circula\u00e7\u00e3o na regi\u00e3o em estudo, descreve-se agora resumidamente os dados utilizados e a metodologia adoptada neste trabalho.\nO Instituto de Oceanografia y Cambio Global (IOCAG) cedeu dados CTD de oito campanhas oceanogr\u00e1ficas no \u00e2mbito do projecto da Radial Profunda de Canarias - RAPROCAN. Em tr\u00eas dessas oito campanhas tamb\u00e9m estavam dispon\u00edveis dados LADCP. Detalhes sobre cada campanha e sobre o posicionamento das 18 esta\u00e7\u00f5es analisadas podem ser vistos na tabela 1 e na figura 1 respectivamente. Note-se que as campanhas foram levadas a cabo durante diferentes esta\u00e7\u00f5es do ano, com excep\u00e7\u00e3o da Primavera. Informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre os diferentes processamentos de dados LADCP e a qualidade dos mesmos podem ser encontradas no ap\u00eandice da disserta\u00e7\u00e3o, na p\u00e1gina 32.\nDesses dados calculou-se o transporte de volume da Corrente das Can\u00e1rias, ao qual foi retirado o efeito do transporte de Ekman \u00e0 camada de superf\u00edcie da coluna de \u00e1gua. Comparou-se este transporte com o transporte de Sverdrup local para melhor compreender os processos que ditam a variabilidade da CC. Os dados de vento para estes c\u00e1lculos s\u00e3o provenientes do National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) e interpolados com o modelo de Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF).\nAp\u00f3s o ajuste do transporte geostr\u00f3fico pela informa\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados de velocidade de LADCP, chegou-se \u00e0 conclus\u00e3o que era necess\u00e1rio estabelecer um novo n\u00edvel de refer\u00eancia para o c\u00e1lculo da velocidade geostr\u00f3fica, apenas para o tro\u00e7o zonal das esta\u00e7\u00f5es analisadas. Finalmente, comparou-se o transporte geostr\u00f3fico ajustado obtido ap\u00f3s a elei\u00e7\u00e3o de um n\u00edvel de refer\u00eancia mais pr\u00f3ximo da realidade com o transporte da zona central superior do oceano Atl\u00e2ntico Norte. Este \u00faltimo \u00e9 proveniente dos programas de Rapid Climate Change - RAPID &amp; RAPID WATCH.\nPara mais detalhes sobre os dados utilizados neste trabalho e as equa\u00e7\u00f5es utilizadas para estes c\u00e1lculos, tal como as vari\u00e1veis intervenientes, veja-se a sec\u00e7\u00e3o 2 e 3 respectivamente.\nPassamos agora \u00e0 apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados. Analisando os gr\u00e1ficos das figuras 2 e 3 verificamos que as massas de \u00e1gua presentes nesta regi\u00e3o s\u00e3o: \u00c1gua Central do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (North Atlantic Central Water - NACW), \u00c1gua Interm\u00e9dia Ant\u00e1rctica (Antarctic Intermediate Water - AAIW), \u00c1gua Mediterr\u00e2nica (Mediterranean Water - MW) e \u00c1gua Profunda do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (North Atlantic Deep Water - NADW). Os dois \u00faltimos tipos n\u00e3o foram encontrados nas esta\u00e7\u00f5es de 1-5, entre o arquip\u00e9lago e a costa africana, como se pode constatar com facilidade pelos diagramas G-S. Na campanha RAPROCAN 1010 \u00e9 poss\u00edvel ver ind\u00edcios de um v\u00f3rtice mediterr\u00e2nico (do ingl\u00eas, mediterranean eddy - Meddy) entre as esta\u00e7\u00f5es 6-10, imediatamente a oeste das ilhas Lanzarote e Fuerteventura.\nNa figura seguinte, v\u00ea-se o transporte de volume, por camada, da superf\u00edcie at\u00e9 ao fundo. A coluna de \u00e1gua foi dividida em 12 camadas, conforme o seu n\u00edvel de densidade neutra (ver tabela 2). A camada de superf\u00edcie j\u00e1 conta com a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o do transporte de Ekman, de acordo com os valores da tabela 3, que embora pequeno, n\u00e3o pode ser negligenciado na compara\u00e7\u00e3o com o transporte de Sverdrup mais adiante. O transporte resultante \u00e9 negativo, ou seja para sul, com valores mais altos a menores n\u00edveis de densidade neutra. A excep\u00e7\u00e3o desde \u00faltimo ponto \u00e9 a campanha de 1212 onde o sinal do transporte junto \u00e0 superf\u00edcie n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito claro. O transporte mais intenso verifica-se em Agosto e em Outubro.\nPara completar esta an\u00e1lise, veja-se a figura 6 sobre o transporte acumulado por pares de esta\u00e7\u00f5es, focando apenas no transporte da termoclina (linha vermelha). Aqui separou-se o transporte a Este de Lanzarote do transporte da restante parte do transecto, para melhor entender a din\u00e2mica individual destes locais. A invers\u00e3o da Corrente de Afloramento das Can\u00e1rias tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 vis\u00edvel nestes gr\u00e1ficos ao observarmos a linha entre -14\u00b0 e -13\u00b0 de longitude. O sinal incerto do m\u00eas de Dezembro devido \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de v\u00f3rtices (como se pode constatar pelos m\u00e1ximos e m\u00ednimos alternados nos gr\u00e1ficos) explica o que j\u00e1 foi mencionado sobre a figura 5. Apesar disso, torna-se claro que o transporte acumulado da CC \u00e9 sempre para sul.\nA sec\u00e7\u00e3o 4.3 explica em que medida os dados LADCP ajudam a avaliar a velocidade geostr\u00f3fica e consequentemente o transporte calculado anteriormente. Para tal, compararam-se individualmente os perfis de velocidade geostr\u00f3fica e de velocidade LADCP. Atrav\u00e9s da diferen\u00e7a m\u00e9dia entre os dois perfis, obtiveram-se velocidades de refer\u00eancia por cada par de esta\u00e7\u00f5es. Estas ser\u00e3o por sua vez adicionadas \u00e0 velocidade geostr\u00f3fica, criando assim perfis de velocidade ajustada. Isto nem sempre \u00e9 poss\u00edvel realizar, dependendo do ruido presente nos dados LADCP. Houve v\u00e1rios destes casos na campanha de 1211, como se pode ver pela figura 9.\nA figura 10 mostra o transporte de volume resultante, por camada, ap\u00f3s o ajuste de LADCP. Comparando com a figura 5, nota-se que o transporte muda de sinal, em profundidade, a um n\u00edvel de densidade neutra mais perto da superf\u00edcie que na figura 5. Por este motivo podemos declarar que o n\u00edvel inicial de refer\u00eancia para o c\u00e1lculo da velocidade geostr\u00f3fica ter\u00e1 de ser redefinido. No entanto, se compararmos a figura 11 com a sua hom\u00f3loga de transporte inicial acumulado (fig. 6), podemos constatar as maiores diferen\u00e7as do transporte inicial est\u00e3o nos n\u00edveis interm\u00e9dios e profundos. As semelhan\u00e7as entre os transportes de termoclina permitem assim o estudo da variabilidade do transporte mesmo entre campanhas sem ajustes de LADCP.\nPassemos ent\u00e3o aos resultados finais. As figuras 12 e 13 s\u00e3o semelhantes \u00e0 figura 5, ou seja, mostram o transporte de volume resultante por camada. Para as campanhas com dados LADCP mostram-se duas curvas em cores distintas, para o transporte com e sem ajustamento.\nA principal diferen\u00e7a entre as figuras 12 e 13 \u00e9 que a primeira apenas mostra o transporte resultante para as esta\u00e7\u00f5es de 1-5, junto \u00e0 costa africana. Nessa figura, na campanha RAPROCAN 1010, v\u00ea-se claramente a fase de transi\u00e7\u00e3o da direc\u00e7\u00e3o da CUC. \u00c9 nessa altura que a corrente se torna inst\u00e1vel ap\u00f3s o cessamento dos fortes ventos al\u00edseos de Ver\u00e3o. Isto permite o afloramento do fluxo subsuperficial para norte, instalando-se assim a invers\u00e3o da CUC vis\u00edvel nas campanhas de 1211 e 1212. A figura 13 j\u00e1 foi gerada ap\u00f3s estabelecer um novo n\u00edvel de refer\u00eancia para o c\u00e1lculo da velocidade geostr\u00f3fica. Tamb\u00e9m aqui nas primeiras camadas de densidade neutra o transporte atinge maiores valores do que em profundidade. No gr\u00e1fico de 1212 o sinal do transporte \u00e9 pouco claro, provavelmente devido \u00e0 sua baixa magnitude. A diferen\u00e7a entre o transporte com e sem ajuste de LADCP est\u00e1 dentro do erro calculado, representado na figura 11, motivo pelo qual a variabilidade do transporte pode ser analisada sem o ajuste de LADCP.\nO transporte de Sverdrup depende principalmente do rotacional da tens\u00e3o do vento. Para a regi\u00e3o em causa, a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial do rotacional apresenta uma estrutura complexa com c\u00e9lulas alternadamente positivas e negativas a su-sudoeste das ilhas (vide figura 15). Comparando as v\u00e1rias campanhas para o m\u00eas de Fevereiro nota-se que existe muita variabilidade, provavelmente devido \u00e0 passagem de sistemas de baixa press\u00e3o que perturbam o campo do vento, pr\u00f3prio desta altura do ano. Apesar disso, \u00e9 preciso ter em conta que a teoria de Sverdrup foi desenvolvida para o oceano interior, podendo n\u00e3o explicar por completo o transporte de volume na bacia das Can\u00e1rias. Um resumo da variabilidade dos transportes de volume, de Sverdrup, e de Ekman nessa \u00e1rea pode ser consultado na tabela 5.\nPor fim, comparamos a variabilidade do transporte da Corrente das Can\u00e1rias com a variabilidade da circula\u00e7\u00e3o termohalina atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise do transporte na zona central superior do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (UMO). Veja-se ent\u00e3o na figura 16 o transporte da UMO estandardizado e o correspondente desvio padr\u00e3o. O transporte estandardizado da Corrente de Afloramento das Can\u00e1rias varia aproximadamente com a linha da UMO estandardizada, o que se pode ver pelos pontos azuis, vermelhos e amarelos (diferentes modos de calcular a CUC). A excep\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a campanha de 1010 correspondente ao n\u00famero 6, pois a UMO nesse ano est\u00e1 longe da m\u00e9dia (ponto preto). A verde est\u00e1 o transporte estandardizado do ramo principal da CC, apenas para as campanhas com um transporte relativamente substancial. A correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre transportes de CC e UMO \u00e9 muito menor que a correla\u00e7\u00e3o com a Corrente de Afloramento das Can\u00e1rias.\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o permitiu estudar a variabilidade do transporte de volume da Corrente das Can\u00e1rias atrav\u00e9s do processamento de dados de 8 diferentes campanhas oceanogr\u00e1ficas RAPROCAN.\nO campo do rotacional da tens\u00e3o do vento apresenta uma estrutura muito complexa pelo que o c\u00e1lculo do transporte local de Sverdrup requer algum cuidado nesta regi\u00e3o, o que explica, em parte, a discrep\u00e2ncia entre os transportes na campanha de 0209.\nIdentific\u00e1mos a din\u00e2mica local da Corrente de Afloramento das Can\u00e1rias, entre o arquip\u00e9lago e a costa africana. O transporte da CUC varia entre [-3.9; 0.3] Sv, sofrendo uma invers\u00e3o no fim de Outubro at\u00e9 Dezembro inclusive. O ramo principal da CC varia entre [-6.1; -1] Sv, onde a magnitude m\u00e1xima \u00e9 atingida na campanha de 0808 e a m\u00ednima em 0207, o que est\u00e1 aproximadamente de acordo com outros estudos referidos na sec\u00e7\u00e3o 6.\nOs resultados confirmam a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as variabilidades mensais do transporte da Corrente de Afloramento das Can\u00e1rias e do transporte da zona central superior do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte.\nApesar da informa\u00e7\u00e3o reunida neste trabalho, conclui-se que s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios mais dados para entender o que est\u00e1 na origem da rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a UMO e os ramos da Corrente das Can\u00e1rias para de futuro ser poss\u00edvel fazer previs\u00f5es do comportamento da circula\u00e7\u00e3o termohalina e o consequente impacto no nosso clima.\nCorrente das Can\u00e1rias, transporte de volume e variabilidade, LADCP, UMO.\nIndex\n1.\tIntroduction...................................................................1\n2.\tData...........................................................................2\n2.1\tCTD..........................................................................3\n2.2\tLADCP........................................................................4\n2.3\tWind data....................................................................4\n2.4\tRAPID-WATCH MOC data.........................................................4\n3.\tMethodology....................................................................4\n4.\tResults........................................................................9\n4.1\tWater mass identification....................................................9\n4.2\tGeostrophic velocities and initial\ttransport................................13\n4.3\tLADCP adjusted transport....................................................18\n4.4\tFinal transport and new layer of\tno-motion................................22\n5.\tDiscussion....................................................................27\n5.1\tT emporal Variability.......................................................29\n6.\tConclusion....................................................................30\nAppendix A - LADCP bottom-tracking review..........................................32\nCorrelations....................................................................32\nError bars......................................................................33\n7.\tReferences....................................................................36\n1.\tIntroduction\nThe North Atlantic subtropical gyre (NASG) is a dynamic structure of ocean currents, ranging from 20o-40oN &amp; from the African coast to approximately 75\u00b0W (Apel, 1999). It is driven by the wind field of westerlies around 40\u00b0N and the trade winds about 20\u00b0N which, with the Coriolis force, induce an anticyclonic rotation to the gyre (Marshall &amp; Plumb, 2008). The four main currents composing the NASG are the North Equatorial Current, the Gulf Stream (GS), the Azores Current and the Canary Current (CC).\nThe NASG can be divided into a western boundary associated to the GS, an ocean interior and an eastern boundary associated to the CC. The geostrophic balance does apply for most of the NASG, except in the boundaries where other physical processes become progressively more important, when closing in to the continental platform. Consequently, the boundary currents and its physics were the focus of many studies throughout the years such as Munk (1950), Ekman (1923) and Stommel (1948), according to Marshall &amp; Plumb (2008) and Pedlosky (1996), with scientist trying to find models to better describe these individual ocean currents. The Eastern Boundary Currents (EBC) were believed to be of less significance compared to the strong GS flow. Only more recently has the Atlantic\u2019s EBC gained attention regarding its role in the Atlantic\u2019s Meridional Overturning Circulation\u2019s (MOC) variability (Comas-Rodr\u00edguez, 2011).\nThe MOC, also known as the thermohaline circulation or the conveyor belt, is responsible for the heat and mass distribution in the world\u2019s oceans and, consequently, for regulating the Earth\u2019s climate (Atkinson, 2011) (Comas-Rodr\u00edguez, 2011). Warmer water is carried poleward, where it eventually sinks into deep-water layers in the northern North Atlantic. In this process, heat is released to the atmosphere at these latitudes, hence strongly influencing the European weather (Kohl &amp; Stammer, 2008) (Matei et al., 2012). According to Rayner et al. (2011), the MOC can be decomposed into three main components: the Gulf Stream transport, usually measured through the Florida Straits, the upper-mid ocean (UMO) transport between the Bahamas and the African coast and the zonally averaged Ekman transport across the Atlantic. The Atlantic MOC seasonality is dominated by the respective UMO signal, which in its turn depends on Eastern Boundary Current\u2019s density variations (Matei et al., 2012). McCarthy et al. (2012) found that when the UMO is stronger-than-average, the NASG circulation is intensified and a reduction of heat transport takes place.\nThis is not yet fully understood, but the Canary Current variability seems to be related to the Meridional Overturning Circulation (Fraile-Nuez et al., 2010) through the local wind stress curl (Rayner et al., 2011). Therefore, scientists have developed an increasing interest on these currents in order to improve our understanding on the Earth\u2019s self-regulating climate mechanism. Only then can we establish how the MOC would respond to CO2 forcing and how quickly it would respond to the anthropogenic forcing and thus change climate as we know it.\nOur contribution was to analyze the transport variability of the NASG\u2019s eastern boundary current, the CC, through Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) &amp; Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP) data. Previous studies assessed the Canary Basin\u2019s dynamics in many different ways: through CTD, moorings (Mach\u00edn et al., 2010), current profilers (Comas-Rodr\u00edguez, 2011) as well as satellite imagery (Fraile-Nuez &amp; Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra, 2006). Studies\u2019 focuses include eddy characterization around the Archipelago (Pacheco &amp; Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra, 1999), upwelling mechanism in this region (Pelegr\u00ed et al., 2005), (Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al., 2002), mass and heat transport monitoring, among other fields in oceanographic research.\nHern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al. (2005), Mach\u00edn et al. (2006), Fraile-Nuez et al. (2010) and P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2013) were some of the latest studies that contributed to the transport characterization of the Canary Current. The CC has a main branch that flows through the archipelago and a smaller one that flows through what is known as the Lanzarote Passage (LP), between the Canary Islands and the African continent. The latter one was named by\nHern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al. (2005)'s results state that the net thermocline transport in September 2003 is southward (-4.7 \u00b1 0.8 Sv), with a local positive transport of 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 Sv in the LP. The inverse box model of P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2013) showed similar results for fall of 2009 with a net negative thermocline transport of -6.2 \u00b1 0.6 Sv and a positive transport of 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 Sv for the CUC. The other two studies have results for all four seasons, although Fraile-Nuez et al. (2010) only concentrates on LP waters. Mach\u00edn et al. (2006)'s results are in agreement with the first two described works, with strongest thermocline transport in fall (-4.5 \u00b1 1.2 Sv) and a minimum in winter (-1.7 \u00b1 1.0 Sv). In the fall &amp; winter months the LP system behaved different from the rest of the region. The thermocline transport was poleward with a magnitude of 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 Sv &amp; 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 Sv, respectively, as opposed to the strong, negative transport of -2.4 \u00b1 0.1 Sv present in summer. The Fraile-Nuez et al. (2010)'s results for the LP are somewhat different due to the fact that his signal is smoothed through interannual 9 year variability. The transport seems to be low-pass filtered, with smaller values for every season. Furthermore, he found the inversion of the CUC did not occur in every year and when it did, it was in fall, when the strongest southward thermocline transport of -1.3 \u00b1 1.3 Sv took place. Nevertheless, Fraile-Nuez et al. (2010)'s results have associated uncertainties given the fact that they come from mooring measurements. This comes to emphasize the need of other sampling techniques as the LADCP technology applied in some of the RAPROCAN cruises and analyzed in this work. The next section describes the data analyzed throughout this paper, followed by the corresponding methodology description in section 3. In the fourth section we present the results of this study, and its discussion can be seen in section 5. Section 6 holds the conclusions of this research work.\n2.\tData\nAn assembly of oceanographic cruises were carried out in the Canary Basin under the Radial PROfunda de CANarias (RAPROCAN) project. Data from eight of these RAPROCAN cruises was granted by the Instituto de Oceanograf\u00eda y Cambio Global (IOCAG). All cruises were done on board of the Cornide de Saavedra vessel, except Rap 7 which was executed on the vessel \u00c1ngeles Alvari\u00f1o. Table 1 summarizes the settings of the different cruises, with a simple numbering in the first column, followed by the names of cruises in the second column, the respective period at sea in the third column, the total number of sampled stations of the cruise in the fourth column and the last one describes which of the cruises has LADCP data available.\nTable 1 -RAPROCAN cruises and their respective specifications: numbering, cruise name, cruising period, total number of hydrographic stations and availability of LADCP data.\n#\tCruises\tDates\tNumber of total stations\tLADCP\n1\tRAPROCAN 0206\t23 Feb.-5 Mar. 2006\t21 (radial)\t\n2\tRAPROCAN 0906\t6-16 Sep. 2006\t28 (radial)\t\n3\tRAPROCAN 0207\t16-21 Feb. 2007\t28 (radial)\t\n4\tRAPROCAN 0808\t20-29 Aug. 2008\t27 (radial)\t\n5\tRAPROCAN 0209\t20-28 Feb. 2009\t27 (radial)\tYES\n6\tRAPROCAN 1010\t26-31 Oct. 2010\t28 (radial)\t\n7\tRAPROCAN 1211\t1-7 Dec. 2011\t24 (radial)\tYES\n8\tRAPROCAN 1212\t11-17 Dec. 2012\t26 (radial)\tYES\nWe chose the first 18 stations that range from 18.5\u00b0-15.5\u00b0W at latitude 29\u00b020'N and from that point on until [28\u00b040'N, 13\u00b0W], through the Fuerteventura-Lanzarote strait. Regardless of the campaign year, the stations have the same coordinates and were chosen this way to focus only on the Canary Current (see positioning in map of figure 1). These 8 cruises sampled\nFig. 1 - Mapping of processed stations of the RAPROCAN cruises. In blue is the ocean bathymetry represented. Isobaths with 750 m spacing, starting at 500 m depth.\nAfter computing geostrophic water transport, the wind stress was derived for the surface Ekman Layer (Fraile-Nuez et al., 2010). Wind velocities were retrieved from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and then interpolated to the grid of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (courtesy of Cana-Cascallar, L. (2014), IOCAG). This is a mesoscale, numerical model, which allows to simulate data and to forecast weather conditions through a data assimilation system. The NCEP raw data are transformed through the WRF model in order to account to the smaller scaled orography effects and to have a more accurate spatial resolution (Cana-Cascallar, 2014) (WRF, 2014).\nWe wanted to compare our thermocline transport with the local Sverdrup transport which is obtained through the wind stress curl. WRF data was also used for this calculation.\nTo validate the wind stress curl results obtained with this model, we also used data from reanalysis ERA-Interim (ECMWF, 2014), although we do not show the results. ERA-Interim is an assimilation data set, combining atmospheric models and past meteorological observations, from the European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF).\nLastly, we compared the temporal variability of our results to the UMO variability in order to establish if there is a relationship between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the Eastern Boundary Current dynamics. To this purpose we draw data from programmes Rapid Climate Change (RAPID) and RAPID - Will the Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation Halt? (RAPID-WATCH), where the latter is simply the continuation of the other (RAPID, 2014). They compose a decade (2004-2014) of observations of the MOC components, behavior and characteristics.\n2.1\tCTD\nData was collected from dual sensors and water samples of a 24-bottle Rosette, for each of the campaigns' 18 casts. Calibrations were done in accordance to World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) standards (RAPROCAN, 2014) for temperature and depth, and with an AUTOSAL 8400B salinometer for conductivity, with slope corrections (Mock, 2011) .\n2.2\tLADCP\nLADCP is an acoustic current-meter, its usage has matured over the last decade. It directly measures velocity profiles within the water column. Through it, we can check the actual velocity in the layer of no motion and establish a reference velocity by comparing the LADCP velocity profile and the geostrophic velocity profile as suggested by Comas-Rodr\u00edguez (2011). The adjusted geostrophic velocity obtained through this is then used to compute the water transport between two stations, from the surface to the bottom. Water transport cannot be directly calculated from LADCP measured velocities due to the high noise level of the instrument.\nComas-Rodr\u00edguez (2010) describes the sampling methodology of this profiling technique. Two profilers where deployed attached to the Rosette. One of them was a free running Quartermaster ADCP, which worked in down-looking mode at 150 kHz. The other LADCP was a 300 kHz workhorse ADCP, with one up-looking unit run in slave mode, and one down-looking master unit. For further details about the LADCP profiling techniques and the respective obtained velocities please consult the appendix on pages 32 and following. The results of a brief statistic study about the LADCP velocities are showed there.\nMany campaigns since 2006 have measured current velocities through LADCP. Unfortunately, the quality of these measurements depends on the experience of handling these kind of profilers. For this reason, the data from the first campaigns had to be discarded. Also, due to problems with the battery of the equipment measurements conducted during RAPROCAN 6 had to be also left out. This left us with only 3 campaigns with apt data to process: RAPROCAN 5, RAPROCAN 7 and RAPROCAN 8, but we believe that it is enough to study the transport of the first layers of the water column.\n2.3\tWind data\nThe set-up for both data sets was the same. WRF-transformed and ERA-Interim data had a grid spacing of 0.125\u00b0 x 0.125\u00b0, a spatial domain ranging from [23.875\u00b0 - 8.125\u00b0] W to [24.125 - 35.875\u00b0] N and for the same periods of sampling of each RAPROCAN cruise, with a 6h interval. WRF model results usually perform very well at this resolution, with recognizable small scale features being visible. ERA-Interim has some difficulties in correctly describing the complex wind-eddy field around the Canarian Archipelago, but it does have good atmospheric models to forecast wind speeds (Dee et al., 2013).\n2.4\tRAPID-WATCH MOC data\nThe MOC transport and its three respective components are available for download ate the RAPID website www.rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc. Transport was computed according to the methods of Cunningham et al. (2007), in order to maximize the northward water transport of upper waters of the MOC. The mid-ocean transport is usually defined as the integrated transport from the surface to the depth around 1100 m. Time series have a 12 h step and range from the 2nd April 2004 to 2nd October 2014. The data, in Sverdrup, are low-pass filtered.\n3.\tMethodology\nThe interactive platform MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB), founded in 1984, is a broadly used tool for numerical programming and visualization (MathWorks, 2014). In this platform we executed toolboxes and scripts especially developed for the purpose of this study. The toolboxes featured the CSIRO SEAWATER toolbox (Phil Morgan &amp; Steve Rintoul 1992), among others, such as M_Map (Rich Pawlowicz April 1997) and Tidal Model Driver for the OSU TOPEX/Poseidon Global Inverse Solution TPXO (2010 Egbert &amp; Erofeeva, COAS). This last toolbox makes tide correction through the TPXO tide model based on the Laplace Tidal Equations, which uses altimetry data from the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite (TOPEX, 2014). It accounts for 10 harmonic and 3 non-linear components of the tide prediction equations. The\nAll equations are according to the International System of Units (SI units). Henceforth, by applying the term \u201ctransport\u201d we refer to volume transport and its SI units are [m3s-1] which is equivalent to 10-6 Sv.\nTo begin with, we drew simple Potential Temperature-Salinity (6 -S) diagrams and vertical sections to glance at the CTD sampled data and identify water masses and possible eddy structures (section 4.1). Next, we extracted the dynamic height and the coordinates from the CTD data to compute geostrophic velocities (results in section 4.2) with the thermal wind equation of Marshall &amp; Plumb (2008), through the dynamic method.\nVg(z) -Vg\u00c7zJ = \u2014\ng z Ida f 1 Po dx\ngdD\naz = \u2014\nf dx\n(1)\nIn the leftmost side of this equation we have the difference between two geostrophic velocities at different depth levels z and z1t whereas the rightmost side of it show the zonal partial derivative of the dynamic height D multiplied by the negative factor of the gravitational acceleration g, divided by the Coriolis parameter f - which is explained further below. The other variables of equation (1) are: a reference density p0 of ocean water of 1023 kg m-3 and a zonal partial derivative of potential density a, which is vertically integrated\nTo apply the dynamic method we assume there are underlying adjacent and opposite flowing ocean currents. The method admits a layer between these two water masses where the flow must be zero. Based on other works done in this region before, such as Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al. (2005), Mach\u00edn et al. (2006), Comas-Rodr\u00edguez (2011) or P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2013), we use neutral density values to divide the water column into 12 different layers (table 2). Jackett &amp; McDougall (1997) introduced this variable to reduce errors in deep ocean calculations, since potential density underperformed. Neutral density yn is defined as the scalar potential that satisfies:\nVyn = bp(pVS \u2014 aVO)\n(2)\nwhere b is an integration factor, a and p are the thermal expansion and saline contraction coefficients, respectively, S is the Salinity and 0 the potential temperature. Table 2 also shows which water mass corresponds to a certain neutral density interval in the Canary Basin.\nTable 2 - Neutral Density layers used in the analysis and the equivalent water masses per layer. The density values refer to the lower limit of each layer. Adapted from Perez-Hernandez et al.

Together with these files the CTD data are processed and a bathymetry file is generated, in order to obtain realistic geostrophic velocities at the slope of the ocean bottom (Rayner et al., 2011). We used two different bathymetry data sets: one that originates from Sandwell &amp; Smith (1997), and another one from the M_Map toolbox - the Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography, or GSHHS.\nAn axis rotation was applied to the current velocities, in the diagonal section of the transect, according to Protter &amp; Protter (1988), with x,y as the original coordinates and a theta of -13.1\u00b0 as the angle between the initial and the final axis.\nt x' = x \u2022 cos(0) + y- sin(0)\t(3)\n{ y' = \u2014x \u2022 sin(&amp;) + y \u2022 cos(0)\nThe Ekman and Sverdrup transports were also calculated. The results are shown in sections\n4.2,\t4.4 and 5. The equations as they appear in Fraile-Nuez &amp; Hernandez-Guerra (2006) are:\nVekm\n\u2014TX\n\u2014-dx [m3s-1]\nPof\n(4)\n\n\u00c7rot(f) Vsver = J ~70TdX\n(52)\nBoth transports are zonally integrated, since our stations are approximately aligned in one latitude. We will discuss the motivations of this choice later in section 4.2. The reference value of the ocean water density is written as p0, as was already explained. Transports depend on the wind stress and consequently on a wind drag coefficient Cd. The respective formulas taken from Hernandez-Guerra &amp; Nykjaer (1997) are as follows:\nc\t(1.14*10 3\tif lvwindl \u2014 10 ms 1\t(6)\nd\t1(0.49 + 0.065|i7w\u00bfnd|) * 10-3 if tfwina1 > 10 ms-1\nTX\n,Ty\nPairCdUwind|Vwind|\n= PairCdVwmd|Vwind|\n(7)\nHere pair is the reference surface air density and u, v are the zonal, meridional components of the wind at 10 m above the mean sea level. The curl of the wind stress is needed to compute the Sverdrup transport. Its equation, taken from Marshall &amp; Plumb (2008) is: *\n_\tdiy dix\nrot(T)=-d7\u2014y\n(8)\nf = 2 - ft- sin(^)\n(9)\ndf 2-0\t(103 )\ndy a\nBoth Sverdrup and Ekman transports were computed with the data points closest to the coordinates of the zonal segment of the transect. We found this to be the best strategy to compare the Sverdrup to the geostrophic transport, after testing this for various latitudes, among other things. Sverdrup transport is very sensitive to the wind stress curl values, with small spatial averaging or changes in latitude completely altering the outcome of the transport. As for the Ekman transport, we simply calculate the accumulated transport at the La Palma longitude and then divided by the total summed distance of the correspondent accumulated transport. Henceforth, when we examine the accumulated transport we will always analyze it from East to West. By doing so, we assume that the Ekman transport is constant over the whole transect. Then we multiply by the individual distance between each RAPROCAN station point. This is the resultant Ekman transport for each station pair and it is then subtracted from each correspondent geostrophic transport per station pair, in order to respect the balance equation between the Sverdrup transport and the geostrophic transport:\n^Sverdrup = ^geostrophic + ^Ekman\n(11)\n(Fraile-Nuez &amp; Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra, 2006).\nAfter computing transport through geostrophic velocities we now want to assess the accuracy of the results by comparing them to the transport obtained using LADCP profiles (see section 4.3). We start by calculating the tide velocity components which will have to be removed from the velocity measured by the LADCP.\nAfter the LADCP profiles are corrected, with the tide effect removed and with the local axis rotation applied, the relative velocities can be finally derived. For that, the geostrophic velocity graph is carefully compared to the LADCP one. If the graph is too noisy or if the two curves are too far apart, then the station is discarded and the respective reference velocity represented by not-a-number (NaN). Otherwise, a depth interval is chosen where the LADCP profile behavior is closer to the geostrophic velocity profile. The program will take the mean of those LADCP velocities and add it to the geostrophic profile. This way, a reference velocity is obtained, which is the actual velocity of the level of no-motion, resulting in a new, adjusted, geostrophic velocity profile.\nLADCP velocities, like any other instrument measurements, have their associated uncertainty which will affect the new, adjusted, geostrophic velocity and, consequently, the transport yet to be computed. We took those uncertainties and calculated first of all the error propagation for the mean velocity between station pairs. This was followed by the estimate of yet another error propagation, this time of the mean velocity within the selected depth interval. Both propagations follow the next equation (Bell (2001), Averaging, Errors and Uncertainty):\nerror propagation =\ni i\\^N\t: 2\n\u2014 I y\tuncertaintyi\nN^\u00bf-i\u00ed=i\n(12)\nFor the first error propagation, N is the number of one pair of stations and the uncertainty is acquired directly from the LADCP data. This gives us one value per vertical level. For the second error propagation, N is the number of vertical levels of each individual depth interval, for each station pair. After these two estimates we end up with one error value per station pair, which is actually the uncertainty of the reference velocity. We can neglect geostrophic velocity uncertainties due to the good quality of CTD measurements and only have to account for the error of the reference velocity for the transport error. This way, the uncertainty of the transport is proportional to the reference velocity uncertainty (Averaging, Errors and Uncertainty):\na(x + Ax) = ax + aAx\t(13)\nFinally, we computed the adjusted accumulated transport between station points. It is computed as an integral, with a gap for the Lanzarote Island. By summing the gamma layers by water mass (as grouped in table 2), we subdivided the transport into thermocline, intermediate and bottom layers and plotted them. Furthermore, we plotted the summed transport of all station pairs, for every gamma layer. We also plotted the net transport per layer, summed for the Lanzarote Passage only (at station 5).\nFor the 3 cruises with LADCP data we produced two kinds of curves for the net transport per layer to be able to establish a new layer of no-motion of 27.975 kg m-3 where the transport changes its direction in depth. With this new layer of no motion, we computed new geostrophic velocities and its resulting transport (results in section 4.4). This was only applied to stations 6 to 18, because the LP's chosen layer of no motion was accurately selected and did not need to be corrected.\nIn section 5 we discuss the obtained results and examine the variability of the calculated transport. Due to the fact that the analyzed RAPROCAN cruises did not cover all the season, we had to find an alternative way to group the cruises in order to understand their seasonal variability. This resulted in the following arrangement: February, August, fall (September &amp; October) &amp; December. We decided not to group December and February as winter because the trade wind regime, responsible for the current dynamics, is not the same.\nWe also discuss the relationship between the Atlantic MOC and the EBC variability. In this context, we compared transport computed through inverse box models by Mach\u00edn et al. (2006), Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al. (2005) and the accumulated transport at different points of our transect to the monthly averaged UMO time-series. The UMO was found to be better correlated to the eastern boundary than the Atlantic MOC itself by various researches, including P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (in prep.), which is why we chose only to compare our results to the UMO transport. Both UMO and Canary Current transports were standardized according to Jolliffe (2002):\nx(standardized);\nXj-x\na\n(14)\nHere xt is the transport at time i, x is the average transport in time and a is the corresponding standard deviation. Standardization implies that the resultant transports at time i have 0 mean and standard deviation of 1. This allows us to correctly compare different kinds of variables.\n4.\tResults\n4.1\tWater mass identification\nNear the Canary Archipelago, the existent water masses are the North Atlantic Central Water (NACW), the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), the Mediterranean Water (MW) and the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) - if a certain depth is reached (Mach\u00edn et al., 2006). To identify these water masses and to check their temporal and spatial variation we analyze the potential temperature-Salinity (0-S) diagrams in figure 2 and the vertical sections of figure 3. The different colors of the plotted values in figure 2 refer to sampling in the Lanzarote Passage (blue) and to the remainder of the transect (black).\nWe can clearly see the presence of the four described water masses: NACW has the highest temperature and salinity values, whereas NADW reaches the lowest values depicted in figure 2. AAIW and MW can be seen in the center of the graphs, where the dots are more scattered. Blue dots in the 5-10 \u00b0C interval represent AAIW and black dots in the same interval portray waters more similar to MW.\nFig. 2 - O-S diagrams. Blue - Lanzarote Passage waters, black - waters of the rest of the transect. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the center-right part of each graph.\nWe can see that there are no significant changes throughout the seasons, except for the mixed layer of surface waters and when some random cruise has a peak of warm, salty water, as a sign of a Mediterranean eddy (Meddy) presence. Also, notice that the Lanzarote Passage waters are always less salty than the rest of the respective transect waters, with purer AAIW. This is visible throughout all months, regardless of the direction of the flow (see figure 12) due to the stretching of the Intermediate layers as described in Mach\u00edn &amp; Pelegr\u00ed (2009). This comes to show that AAIW can be found northward of the Canary Archipelago throughout the year, near the African coast.\nFigure 3 confirms and completes the analysis described above, with each row representing a different RAPROCAN sampling period and each row a different variable - Potential Temperature, Salinity and Neutral Density. Evidence of upwelling can be seen in the potential temperature vertical section for the February cruises: the upper isothermal is not visible in the Lanzarote Passage, where there is colder upwelled water than in the rest of the transect.\nRAPROCAN0808\tRAPROCAN0209\tRAPROCAN0207\tRAPROCAN0206\nDepth (m)\tDepth (m)\tDepth (m)\tDepth (m)\n5\t13\t11\t9\t7\t531\t18 17\t15\t13\t11\t9\t7\t5 3 1\t\t18 17\t15\t13\t11\t9\nI I I I I I I I I I II\t\tI J l I I J l I I  \t\t\n\t\u2022 r\nEd\t\nr\t\nk\tSalinity\t\nRAPROCAN1211\tRAPROCANIOIO\tRAPROCAN0906\nDepth (m)\tDepth (m)\tDepth (m)\n0\n500 woo 1500\n2000\n3000\n4000\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n3000\n4000\n0\n500 1000 1500\n2000\n3000\n4000\nIS ir IS 13 11\t9\t7\t53 1\nI\n18\t17\t16\t15\t14\nLongitude (\u00b0W)\n24 8\t26,85\t27,38\t27 922\t28,129\nIB 17 15 13 11\t9\t7\t$3 1\n18\t17\t18\t15\t14\nLongitude (\u00b0W)\nFig. 3 - Vertical Sections of different water properties, as labeled in the bottom right corner of the graphs. Correspondent color bars are at the bottom of each column. Each row corresponds to a different RAPROCAN cruise, labeled on the left side of the depth scale.\nWe can find another hint on the Meddy presence in the vertical sections of potential temperature and of salinity in the October campaign. Notice how a saltier water core extents from 500 m to 1500 m west of Lanzarote. It corresponds to the position of a warmer water core centered at approximately 1000 m. This is the same cruise which has a peak of colder, saltier water in figure 2.\nOtherwise, the water mass characteristics and distributions have no special features. The neutral density vertical sections of figure 3 show a well stratified ocean for all cruises. Temperature ranges from approximately 2 \u00b0C under 3000 m to 18 or 25 \u00b0C at surface, depending on the season. Isolines under 16 \u00b0C do not seem to shift seasonally in depth. Salinity varies between 34.8 and 37.1, from ocean bottom to surface respectively, with the discontinuities in the 500-1500 m interval due to the presence of saltier cores of water.\n4.2\tGeostrophic velocities and initial transport\nIn the next figure we will present cross sections with geostrophic velocity contours, with northward flow represented in blue and southward shown in red. The geostrophic velocity computed through the described dynamic method in section 3 is only the baroclinic component of ocean current (Apel, 1999). There is yet no perfect technique to obtain the exact, absolute velocity of the ocean current in the deep ocean (Comas-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2010). Also, the choice of the level of no motion has not an unequivocal definition, but we assume that the latest studies are close to the real value.\nLongitude (\u00b0)\tLongitude (\u00b0)\nLongitude (\u00b0)\nLongitude (\u00b0)\nLongitude (\u00b0)\tLongitude (\u00b0)\nLongitude (\u00b0)\tLongitude (\u00b0)\nFig. 4 - Geostrophic velocity contours, with bathymetry shaded in black. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the bottom right corner of each graph. Blue - northward flowing current, red -southward flow, grey - zero velocity. Isolines with 1.5 cm/s spacing.\nOne of the most obvious things we can observe for figure 4 is that the horizontal line formed by the zero velocity isolines around the depth of 3000 m is an artifact of our chosen layer of no motion. This contour line oscillates around this depth from cruise to cruise in the same manner that the gamma layer of 28.072 kg m-3 does. Moreover, the dynamics of the Lanzarote Passage are clearly visible here, since the poleward current is at the bottom of the passage during February and August, whereas in December it's at the surface, with a transition phase in fall. Otherwise, only a complex structure of cells with adjacent, opposite flows are visible here.\nTo accurately compare the geostrophic transport with the Sverdrup transport as proposed in section 3, we must first calculate the Ekman transport to have it subtracted from the top layer\nTable 3 - Accumulated Ekman transport at 18.5\u00b0 W, for each RAPROCAN cruise period. Units in Sv.\n0206\t0207\t0209\t0808\t0906\t1010\t1211\t1212\tMean\n-0.07\t0.09\t0.00\t0.30\t0.09\t0.13\t0.37\t0.06\t0.12\nGiven the trade wind variability, Ekman transport should be greater in high summer, where winds are most intense (Pacheco &amp; Hernandez-Guerra, 1999), although there is evidence of a second maximum in northward Ekman transport around January (Atkinson et al., 2010). Comparing 0808 to 0906 and 1010 we can see that these years wind field behave as expected, that is, they lose strength after summer. Knowing that trade winds are easterlies, Ekman transport should always be positive, since Coriolis force deflects the current to the right in the northern hemisphere. This is not the case for 0206. 0209 is also abnormal since it shows no meridional Ekman transport. Machin et al. (2006) and Perez-Hernandez et al. (2013) also found southward Ekman transport in this region, possibly due to the passing of a Low Pressure system during winter (Pelegri et al., 2005). Last of all, transport in 1211 is rather strong for that season, compared to the value obtained by Machin et al. (2006).\nThe transport obtained after including the Ekman contribution in the initial velocities of figure 4 can be seen in figure 5 as the transport per layer and in figure 6 as the accumulated transport per station pair.\nBottom\nBottom\n\t\t0206\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\\>\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nL \u00cd\t\t\n\t\t0209\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\ni \t1\ti\t\t\t\t\n\t0207\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\u00cd\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n-\tj\t\t'\t1\t\n\t\t0808\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\ni\t\t\t\nBottom\nBottom\nFig. 5 - Initial net transport per neutral density layer.

Transport is always strongest at surface, with the exception of 2012. The relative minimum at the 27.82 layer, for 1010, is explained by the presence of the Meddy already identified before. In these graphs we can see how the transport decreases slowly to zero in the chosen layer of no motion, although the layer itself at which this happens is an artifact.\nAs we can see, the Ekman transport of table 3 is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the transport depicted here. For this reason, we find that calculating only one component of the Ekman transport is good enough and only use wind stress values at the latitude of the main segment of our transect.\nThe small surface transport in December 2012 will now be clarified through figure 6, where we can see the accumulated transport per station pair. This next figure has three different lines, one for each group of layers according to their neutral density level interval, as is shown in table 2. The red line represents the thermocline transport, whereas the green one represents the intermediate transport. Finally, the blue lines shows the deep transport. The gap at approximately -14\u00b0 of longitude corresponds to the position of the Island of Lanzarote in our transect, separating the transport of the Canary Upwelling Current, in the LP, and the transport of the main branch of the Canary Current in the rest of the transect.\nTransport (Sv)\tTransport (Sv)\tTransport (Sv)\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\n-18\t-17\t-16\t-15\t-14\nLongitude (\u00b0)\n-18\t-17\t-16\t-15\t-14\nLongitude (\u00b0)\n0906\n-18\t-17\t-16\t-15\t-14\nLongitude (\u00b0)\n0206\n0209\nFig. 6 - Initial accumulated transport per station pair. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the top right corner of each graph. Grouped layers: red - from surface to 27.38 kg m-3 gamma layer; green - 27.38 to 27.922 kg m-3 gamma layers; blue - from 27.922 kg m-3 to bottom.\nNotice that here, the intermediate transport is smaller and less variable than the surface and bottom transports. This is an artifact of the chosen layer of no motion, and should not be given much importance in this sense. Here we will focus only on the surface transport, for the Lanzarote Passage and for the rest of the transect. The abrupt,alternating peaks in the transport suggest the presence of eddies, as was identified in Mock (2011) and Comas-Rodr\u00edguez (2011), cyclonic if it is an uppward peak and anticyclonic if its downward.\nUsualy the Canary Upwelling Current transport is negative, meaning a southward flow in the first 5 months. Then it changes into a northward motion in the last two cruises, with a clear transition fase in the October. This is not exactly like the results of Fraile-Nuez et al. (2010). Their study showed a northward transport during fall, with a transition phase in December. Nevertheless, if we take a look at their transport of the individual years, we can see that the inversion is sometimes too weak to be noteworthy or it's occurance period shifts ahead. This is probably related to the wind regime in the area. If the trade winds' maximum strength takes place sooner or later it would alter the period where the southward flow is distabilized due to a high positive vorticity. This positive vorticity would mean an offshore displacement of the current in order to maintain absolute vorticity, and consequently the surfacing of a near-surface poleward undercurrent (Pelegr\u00ed et al., 2005).\nFor the rest of the transect, if we smoothen the effects of the eddies in the transport, we can clearly see that there is always a negative tendency, from station 6 to 18 (i.g. from 14.1\u00b0 to 18.5\u00b0W). This means that the surface waters at the transect have and overall southward movement, as is expected for the eastern boundary current of the NASG (Marshall &amp; Plumb, 2008) (Pedlosky, 1996), eventhought, at times, the transport is locally positive. Furthermore, the graphs tell us that the largest net transport is in August, which is in accordance with the strenghtening of the trade winds at that month.\n4.3\tLADCP adjusted transport\nNext step of this study is to assess how well geostrophic velocities actually describe the flow in the ocean, through the use of LADCP. The tide only slightly affects the LADCP velocity but it should not be neglected. This can be verified by comparing the meridional tide component shown in figure 7 with the velocity profiles of figure 8.\nThe tide velocity always oscilates around zero throughout the transect. Otherwise, there are no important features about the meridional tide component worth mentioning.\nE\n-4\u2014&lt;o o&lt;D\n>\nLongitude (\u00b0)\nFig. 7 - Tide meridional component retrieved from global model TPXO 7.2. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the top right corner of each graph.\nBelow we can see an example of a LADCP profile and the adjusting of the geostrophic velocity profile. For this station pair, the tide velocity would be approximately 0.02 m/s, which would clearly affect the LAdCp. One can see that the adjustment of the profile is somewhat subjective, for the LADCP is very noisy, especially above 1500 m in this case. The difference between the geostrophic transport with the Ekman component (bold black line) and the adjusted geostrophic transport (dashed black line) of figure 8 gives us the relative velocity, which is actually the barotropic component of the ocean current (Apel, 1999).\nFig. 8 - Example of adjustment of geostrophic velocity profiles to LADCP velocity profile. Station pair 11-12 of RAPROCAN cruise 0209. Blue - LADCP velocity; dashed black - geostrophic velocity; black -adjusted geostrophic velocity; green &amp; red - bottom LADCP velocities, for each of the stations composing the station pair; grey, horizontal dashed lines - interval chosen for adjustment.\nLongitude (\u00b0)\nFig. 9 - Reference velocities and error bars. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the top right corner of each graph. Gaps either for Lanzarote at longitude 14\u00b0 W or for discarded stations.\nAnother thing worth noticing is the fact that reference velocities are usually greater in the LP. This could be due to the fact that its removed tide component was not as accurately predicted as for the rest of the transect due to the changing bathymetry (Egbert &amp; Erofeeva, 2002). However, the most probable explanation for these higher reference velocities is that the Lanzarote Passage is shallower and narrower than the rest of the transect and has therefore stronger currents. Consequently, the depth interval from which the reference velocities are derived is also shallower, with currents with high variability in speed and direction, which surely must affect the resulting reference velocities.\nIf we assume that these reference velocity values are realistic, then the barotropic component of the current must be stronger in an along-slope context. Since Aaboe et al. (2009) found evidence of this behavior in the Nordic Seas, it would be very interesting to carry out, in the future, a similar analysis in an EBC context.\nWe will now move on to show the consequent transport of the described adjustment.\nTransport (Sv)\nTransport (Sv)\tTransport (Sv)\nFig. 10 - Adjusted net transport per neutral density layer. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the top right corner of each graph.\nNotice in figure 10 how the adjusted net volume transport in the first layers is always southward whereas in the bottom layers it flows poleward. The neutral layer where the transport changes sign is essentially the same in every cruise, 27.975 kg m-3, resting above the selected layer of no motion. We must keep in mind that this represented transport is a summed transport, not a mean transport and therefore not affected by the higher reference level of no-motion of the Lanzarote Passage. This is a crucial detail in this study, for it allows us to correctly choose the new layer of no motion and to obtain a more realistic transport.\nBefore we get to the results of this new layer of no motion, we will show the results for the adjusted accumulated transport per station pairs, with the same color scheme as in figure 6.\nLongitude (\u00b0)\nFig. 11 - Accumulated, adjusted transport per station pair. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the top right corner of each graph. Color legend is the same as figure 6. Uncertainties for 0209, 1211 and 1212 are 0.5 Sv, 1.0 Sv and 0.9 Sv respectively.\nWhen figure 11 is compared to the respective graphs in figure 6, we can observe that the LADCP adjusted velocities mainly affects the bottom layers. Therefore, we can compare the surface layer transport from period to period even for the cruises without LADCP data.\n4.4 Final transport and new layer of no-motion\nTo better visualize the particular dynamics of the Lanzarote Passage, we will now show the net transport per layers only from stations 1 to 5. The cruises with available LADCP data have two curves, one for the transport with and the other without the LADCP adjusted velocities.\nBottom\n<1\t\t0206\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t1\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\u25a0\t\nSurface\n\t\t0209\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\ni 1\t\t\nBottom\n\t\t0207\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t J\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t.\t\nSurface\n\t\t0808\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\ni i i\t\t\nFig. 12 - Net transport per neutral density layer in the Lanzarote Passage.

We can clearly see the transition phase in October, where the intermediate transport is also negative. This results in an inversion of the CUC transport, where the surface transport flows poleward and the intermediate transport is negative. It would be very interesting to have data for January in order to check if there is also a transition phase at that time, to close the cycle of the reversal of the transport in the LP. The Canary Upwelling Current was a key point of the study of Fraile-Nuez et al. (2010) who also observed a similar behavior. Likewise, Machin &amp; Pelegri (2009) identified the inversion of transport in the Lanzarote Passage as a typical feature in early fall, after the strong summer trade winds have ceased. The southward flow becomes unstable and the current suffers a westward displacement. In order to keep water mass balance, the subsurface poleward current arises and the inversion of December takes place. 1010 seems to capture the period when the current becomes unstable since we cannot see the normal northward AAIW flowing waters.\nAfter defining 27.975 kg m-3 as the new layer of no motion from stations 6 to 18, we recomputed the net transport per neutral density layers and per station pairs, which will be showed in the following two pictures. To the resemblance of the last shown figure, this following one also shows a black dotted line with the net transport after applying the LADCP adjustment.\nTransport (Sv)\tTransport (Sv)\nTransport (Sv)\tTransport (Sv)\nFig. 13 - Net Transport per neutral density layer. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the top right corner of each graph. Available LADCP adjusted transport is also plotted for the respective cruises. Blue - transport without LADCP contribution; black - LADCP adjusted geostrophic transport.\nFrom figure 13 we can take much information about the transport. For instance, only in the upper layer can transport reach values over 2 Sv. Moreover, we find that when transport is very small, the sign seems to be somewhat unclear, what we can see by comparing the transport with and without the LADCP data in 1212. Please note that the 1211 graph shows the best agreement between transport derived with and without LADCP, but this is not realistic, as can be seen by the lack of stations with reference velocities in figure 9. As for 0209 and 1212, the overall difference between the two profiles is of the same order of the accumulated error of the transport. For that reason we can safely say that, for the upper layers, the transport with LADCP data is comparable to the one computed only with geostrophic velocities. Nevertheless, the LADCP is an important tool to assess a correct layer of no motion.\nNext we will display the accumulated adjusted geostrophic transport per station pair. Since the dynamics of the Lanzarote Passage are not the same as for the rest of the transect, we divided the transport into thermocline and intermediated flow only in the Lanzarote Passage. For the remainder of the stations, the amounts of upper grouped layers - which compose the transport\nLongitude (\u00b0)\tLongitude (\u00b0)\nFig. 14 - Accumulated transport per station pair.

Consequently, if we ignore these effects, we see that in many RAPROCAN cruises there is no overall slope of the transport. The exceptions are: August, where we can clearly see the Canary Current carrying water southward due to the strong negative gradient of the orange curve; and October where there is an abrupt drop of the orange curve right after the Lanzarote gap. The Meddy of 1010 is even now visible, right after the Lanzarote Gap, characterized by a local southward transport peak and a characteristic anticyclonic rotation. At all the other cruise periods, there is little accumulated transport, probably due to the westward migration of the main branch of the CC, as explained in Perez-Hernandez et al. (2013).\nNotice how the black line, the Sverdrup transport, usually follows the upper layer's transport of the CC. The exception is 0209, with a very unusual, positive Sverdrup transport. For all the other cruises, the Sverdrup transport seems at the very least to explain the tendency of the accumulated transport, in accordance to Fraile-Nuez &amp; Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra (2006). The uncertainty of the adjusted geostrophic transport helps to explain the Sverdrup transport, especially if we ignore the effect of the eddy-related peaks.\nPelegr\u00ed et al. (2005) found that it is actually the wind stress that dictates the CUC flow regime which is composed of NACW. As for intermediate waters, its motions are imposed by a totally different source, according to Mach\u00edn &amp; Pelegr\u00ed (2009). They found that the stretching and shrinking of the AAIW stratum in the North Atlantic tropical region induces a northward and southward motion of AAIW, respectively, in order to conserve potential vorticity. The AAIW flow reaches up to Cape Ghir, north of the Canarian Archipelago.\nFrom figure 14, in the LP, we can see how the accumulated transport is usually zero or positive, except in October and December where there is an inversion of the flow direction. This seems to confirm the findings of Mach\u00edn &amp; Pelegr\u00ed (2009), as was already described above regarding the transport per layer in figures 6 and 12.\n5.\tDiscussion\nLet us focus now on the Sverdrup transport and the respective wind stress curl. Table 4 has the same structure of table 3, featuring the results for the Sverdrup transport of the Canary Basin. From this table we can tell that the strength of this transport doesn't follow a clear seasonal pattern, for the greatest values are concerning very different periods.\nTable 4 - Accumulated Sverdrup transport from 14\u00b0 W to 18.5\u00b0 W, for each RAPROCAN cruise period.

(2010) conducted a study at 26\u00b0 N of latitude where they determined the Sverdrup transport seasonality. Their results showed an intensification of the Sverdrup transport at the EBC during winter followed by a weaker than average transport until late summer where it becomes again intensified. The summer intensification can only be identified if we consider the accumulated Sverdrup transport further seaward. This showcases the difficulty in deriving the Sverdrup transport around an archipelago, for the geography interferes with the passing trade winds, creating a complex structure of alternating positive and negative wind stress curl cells, as can be seen next in figure 15.\nLongiude\nLongiude\nFig. 15 - Wind stress curl of the Canary Basin. RAPROCAN cruise period can be identified in the top right corner of each graph. Bold contours for coastlines. Color-bar values in 10-6 N m-3.\nPlease examine the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies downstream of the islands. The strongest eddies are caused by the height and shape of Tenerife. This can be observed more or less with the same pattern in all cruises except 0209. Thus, we have an unusual resultant Sverdrup transport, which does not agree with the observed water transport. We must not forget that we only considered the mean wind over the RAPROCAN cruise periods, which never comprise more than 11 days. In this sense, the wind stress curl fields of figure 15 could have captured a passing mesoscale feature, such as a low pressure system, that disturbed the typical wind field (Atkinson et al., 2010).\nPressure System (Ahrens, 2009). Although this is the major forcing that controls the CC dynamics it does not fully describe them (Pedlosky, 1996). The Sverdrup theory was developed for the ocean interior, it neglects friction and vertical motion (Marshall &amp; Plumb, 2008) and is therefore not the best fit for the EBC (Pedlosky, 1996). The Munk Solution and other circulation models may explain our results better. This requires a more detailed study which is not the aim of this study.\n5.1 Temporal Variability\nT rade winds depend on the position and intensity of the Azores High (H) and the Low pressure systems (L) of the doldrums (which approximately coincide with the ITCZ positioning). This circulation system, the Hadley Cell, is characterized by ascending air at equator and descending at horse latitudes. In between these latitudes are very strong winds, called easterlies or trade winds, since H rotates anti-cyclonically and therefore drives winds in the mentioned direction (Ahrens, 2009). In January, trade winds are centered between 25\u00b0-10\u00b0 N and migrate to 32\u00b0-20\u00b0 N in high summer (Hernandez-Guerra &amp; Nykjaer, 1997). This means that they are more or less constant in the 20\u00b0-25\u00b0 N belt (Hernandez-Guerra et al., 2002). The Canary Archipelago is spread around 28.5\u00b0 N, so at these latitudes, the trade winds are most intense in summer and weaken in September (Fraile-Nuez et al., 2010) (Hernandez-Guerra et al., 2005).\nLet us now analyze the net transport of the months with the same behavior or characteristics, according to the graphs in figure 14. Table 5 summarizes and clusters water volume of the CC and CUC, Ekman and Sverdrup transports as described in section 3. All transports are subdivided into the main branch and the LP area. The last row of the table gives us a mean value for each kind of transport and each of the areas of interest.\nFall and December have very similar geostrophic accumulated transport but completely different values for the Lanzarote Passage. The CUC transport does not suffer much change from August to fall, as opposed to the total transport which decreases considerably. Justifying these bearings by comparison with the local Ekman and Sverdrup transports\u2019 is very difficult. The LP Sverdrup transport, as well as the LP Ekman transport, is approximately constant throughout the year. The latter has a small maximum in August, whereas for the rest of the transect it is strongest in December. We must keep in mind that these values are obtained from transports only up to 18.5\u00b0 W and will therefore not show any resemblance between the Sverdrup transport and the Canary Current if the CC has moved westward. This could explain why Sverdrup and water transports do not behave alike. The total Ekman transport contributes only little to the geostrophic transport and is therefore not of major importance.\nTable 5 - Mean accumulated transport per month or season, for the LP only and the remainder of the transect. For periods with LADCP data, a mean value was taken from the initial and the adjusted transport.

Chidichimo et al. (2010) studied the relationship between the Atlantic MOC and the EBC, while Perez-Hernandez et al. (in prep.) discovered a high correlation between the under mid-ocean (UMO)\ncurrent variability and the CUC transport. To discuss this, we present a graphic with the results for the standardized, adjusted, accumulated geostrophic transport from our RAPROCAN cruises (numbered), as well as standardized CUC transport from scientific articles (blue), and compared it to the standardized UMO curve and its monthly standard deviation (figure 16). The numbered data points present different colors depending on the amount of layers considered as the CUC transport (orange and red). In the case of the green data points, the main branch of the Canary Current was considered for the sake of completeness of this analysis.\nFig. 16 - Normalized transport variability compared to the normalized monthly upper mid-ocean transport. Black - UMO with respective shaded monthly standard deviation in grey; red - accumulated thermocline transport of CUC; orange - Accumulated transport in LP for upper layers with same direction of flow; green - main branch of the Canary Current's transport; blue - CUC thermocline transport from literature, where M stands for Mach\u00edn et al. (2006) and HG stands for Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al. (2005). Numbers refer to cruises as listed in table 1.\nThe figure shows that the Canary Upwelling Current is closest to the UMO variability. The difference between the thermocline transport and the one we obtained by limiting the transport to only the top 2 or 3 layers - which flow in the same direction and vary broadly from cruise to cruise - is not striking. Furthermore, by considering what we identified as the main branch of the CC in our results, its normalized transport seems to be less related to the UMO curve. Also, note how the CUC transport obtained through inverse models in Mach\u00edn et al. (2006) and in Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al. (2005) seems to explain quite accurately the UMO variability.\nWe can see that there is a high interannual variability in February. Since the wind field was very different from cruise to cruise in this month, we assume that this variability is normal for this month, due to the passing storms that are so typical at this time of the year, in this region.\nThe transport obtained in the cruise at the end of October is another matter. Taking a closer look at the figure we can distinguish a black dot in the end of October. This is the normalized UMO transport for the same period as the RAPROCAN cruise 1010. Through it, we can explain why our results are so different from the UMO curve: the upper mid-ocean transport was very weak at that time. All the other CUC transports depicted here seem to be in good agreement with the UMO variability.\n6.\tConclusion\nThis study processes the data of 8 different RAPROCAN cruises in order to obtain the volume transport of the Canary Current as accurate as possible. This includes the dynamics of the Canary Upwelling Current, located in a small section between the Lanzarote Island and the\nMoroccan coast, known as the Lanzarote Passage. For this purpose, we analyze data from CTD casts, and in some cruises also LADCP casts, for the individual period of each cruise. Since data covers different months, we hoped to recognize a pattern in the seasonal variability of the CC and the CUC, separately. To check into what extend the local wind stress curl regulated the flow of the currents we computed the Sverdrup transport for comparison to the water transport.\nThe LP current is not dominated by the local wind stress curl, supporting the study of Mach\u00edn &amp; Pelegr\u00ed (2009). Sverdrup transport seems to describe the tendency of the adjusted, accumulated geostrophic transport of the main branch of the Canary Current, for all cruises except for February 2009. Further investigation is needed to justify this unexpected behavior. We found that caution is needed in the computation of the Sverdrup transport due to its sensitivity to small changes in the selection of the grid points of the wind stress curl field. The wind stress curl field, for the different cruises, indicates an enormous spatial variability, where the only approximately permanent features are the positive and negative vortexes south to southwest of the islands.\nThe Lanzarote Passage's local dynamic was identified, featuring a seasonal inversion of intermediate water's flow, just as was identified in Mach\u00edn &amp; Pelegr\u00ed (2009), Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al. (2003) and Fraile-Nuez et al. (2010), but with a shift in the period when it occurs. CUC transport varies throughout the RAPROCAN cruises approximately between [-3.9; 0.3] Sv. The thermocline and intermediate waters from station 6 to 18 exhibited a transport which fluctuates between [-6.1; -1] Sv, with the strongest transport taking place in August and the weakest in February 2007. This agrees approximately with the results of Fraile-Nuez et al. (2010), Hern\u00e1ndez-Guerra et al. (2003) and Comas-Rodr\u00edguez (2011).\nResults confirm the existence of a relationship between the monthly variability of the thermocline current of the LP - the Canary Upwelling Current - and the UMO current variability, directly related to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The special case of October 2010, when the mean UMO transport is most distant to the CUC transport, is a period where the UMO itself is much lower than usually. This highlights the robustness of the correlation between the upper mid-ocean variability and the Canary Upwelling Current variability.\nIn sum, more cruises covering different months should be carried out. The fall and winter months are of special interest regarding the Lanzarote Passage flow. In the future, we will have enough data to understand the whole Canary Current temporal and spatial variability. This will allow us to comprehend the Meridional Overturning Circulation's variability and increase our knowledge of its impact on our climate.\nAppendix A - LADCP bottom-tracking review\nIn this appendix we take a closer look on the characteristics of LADCP data, through a separate RAPROCAN dataset of 53 stations of October 2013. The purpose of this separate study is to clarify which types of LADCP data retrieval are more alike and which ones are more reliable.\nThe need to better understand deep ocean dynamics encouraged the development of new velocity profiling instruments. In this sense, LADCP came as a welcome innovation, giving a direct insight on ocean bottom velocities, with more spatial flexibility, as well as reduced maintenance time and costs (Fischer &amp; Visbeck, 1993). This technology, although reliable, still has some limitations and disadvantages, mainly due to noise related uncertainties and a complicated data processing software (Visbeck, 2002; Deines, 1999; Thurnherr, 2011).\nThe LADCP measures velocities based on the Doppler Effect by emitting four beams of acoustic signals and receiving the corresponding echo from suspended particles in the water column (Deines, 1999). Each beam measures independently a velocity component from a set of 3 orthogonal velocities, the extra beam is used for redundancy and error calculations. These measured velocities need to be adjusted to absolute velocities by adding constraints to the processed LADCP (Thurnherr, 2011), (Visbeck, 2002). The constraint applied to our data was the so-called bottom-tracking (BT), where the velocity difference between the LADCP profiler and the bottom of the water column is used. This allows us to correct the LADCP measured current velocities by including the movement of the LADCP itself, which is lowered with the rosette. The velocities obtained through this will be used for geostrophic velocity corrections.\nThere is more than one way to acquire the bottom tracking (Visbeck, 2002). We will only mention two types, the intrinsic BT of the LADCP instrument manufacturer - RDIBT - and the post-processed BT, calculated by Visbecks software, here called ownBT. Together with the different LADCP measuring units we arrive at four different processed data combinations: without the BT (noBT), RDIBT with LADCP from only the master unit looking down (onlydownBT), BT applied through Visbeck's software to the whole WH unit (ownBT) and RDIBT applied to the whole WH unit (RDIBT). Other works, such as Thurnherr (2003), already determined that RDIBT has a better range resolution than the ownBT and is therefore considered to retrieve the most reliable data. Therefore, and as was done by Comas-Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2010), we used that intrinsic bottom track data of the instrument to assess the quality of the 3 other methods.\nTo accomplish this, we chose two different approaches. One of them was to calculate the velocity difference between two methods for each station, for each depth, of each velocity component. The methods closest to RDIBT, and consequently the best methods, would have the smallest velocity differences. We then conducted a series of statistics tests, presented in the subsection entitled Error bars. The other approach was to calculate the correlation coefficient for each station, of each velocity component. The results for this are presented in the next subsection.\nCorrelations\nTo calculate the correlation coefficient we first standardized the velocity values where v = (u, v) and each component is an i (vertical) by j (horizontal) matrix of i=421 and j=53.\n(vi \u00a1 \u2014 u(v)\u00a1}\n-\u00a1\u00bf(standardized); &lt;= \u2014\u2019\u25a0\u2014\u2014r------\t(14)\n,J\ta(v))j\nis the mean velocity along the water column and a is the respective standard deviation. We then made sure that the standardized velocities had zero mean and standard deviation of 1. This is a necessary condition to obtain correlation coefficients through the covariance operation (Jolliffe, 2002).\nTable 6 summarizes the correlations computed between all methods and for both horizontal velocity components. It shows minima, maxima, mean values and also the standard deviations. The values are all over 90%, except for correlations with onlydownBT. The best results are those of ownBT. This means that onlydownBT profiles' vertical variations are more distant to the other methods. It becomes clear that, regardless of the method, the zonal velocity has always more problematic stations than the meridional velocity. The methods seem to be independent from one another since the best and the worst correlated stations of one method are never the same for the other methods. It also excludes the possibility of the correlation values being biased by one particular station.\nTable 6 - Correlations between RDIBT and the other methods. The respective station numbers are also listed.\n\tnoBT\t\tonlydownBT\t\townBT\t\n\tu\tv\tu\tv\tu\tv\nMinimum correlation\t0.91\t0.93\t0.58\t0.60\t0.96\t0.97\nStation number\t20;\t21;\t22;\t51;\t19;\t20;\nMaximum correlation\t1.00\t1.00\t0.99\t0.99\t1.00\t1.00\nStation number\t46; 52;\t49;\t2;\t3;\t1; 26; 53;\t38; 51;\nMean correlation\t0.98\t0.99\t0.91\t0.92\t0.99\t1.00\nStandard deviation\t0.02\t0.01\t0.08\t0.08\t0.01\t0.01\nError bars\nAfter computing the difference for the velocities between each two methods, 3 graphs were plotted, showing the mean difference and the standard deviation error bars, for every station, for each velocity component. A simple standard deviation threshold of 0.01 m/s was defined in order do have a common comparison ground for the three methods. Looking at the figures it becomes very clear that onlydownBT has the most different profiles, with very large error bars, whereas ownBT showed the best results. This is in agreement to the correlations computed in the previous subsection.\nFig. 17 - Top (a): RDlBT-noBT error bars; center (b): RDlBT-onlydownBT error bars; bottom (c): RDlBT-ownBT error bars. In red are the stations whose standard deviations overcame the chosen threshold.\nWe then removed the top ten velocity entries from the profile and calculated the same error bars (not shown). This process was repeated for every method comparison, and subsequently the bottom ten velocity entries were removed and the process was repeated. The results for noBT and for onlydownBT improved by removing the top ten velocities from the profile, showing that the worst correspondence is at the top of the profile. The difference is striking in onlydownBT error bars. There was no important alteration in the ownBT results. This comes to show one of the weak points of BT LADCP data, namely, that it strongly depends on its ability to pinpoint the bottom, without noise interference, such as vessel machinery and contamination of previous pings or even the amount of suspended matter in the deep ocean (which influences the scattering of the acoustic signal) (Deines, 1999).\nWe conclude that ownBT is the closest method to RDIBT, closely followed by noBT. OnlydownBT presents the most substantial differences, especially at the top of the profile.\n7.\tReferences\nBook\nAhrens, C. D. (2009).
