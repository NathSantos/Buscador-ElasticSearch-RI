Somente nas \u00faltimas \n\nduas d\u00e9cadas que outras fontes de energia renov\u00e1veis, como a solar \n\nfotovoltaica e a e\u00f3lica, passaram a se tornar relevantes na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nenergia el\u00e9trica em n\u00edvel mundial. Instala\u00e7\u00f5es de sistemas fotovoltaicos \n\nao redor do mundo atingiram crescimento da ordem de 40% durante os \n\n\u00faltimos quinze anos. Entretanto, a grande maioria destes sistemas, (acima \n\nde 90%), est\u00e3o localizados em regi\u00f5es onde o recurso solar n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o \n\nabundante, ou seja, fora da regi\u00e3o dos tr\u00f3picos do planeta. Devido a este \n\nfato, ao tentar incorporar a energia solar fotovoltaica \u00e0s redes el\u00e9tricas, \n\numa pergunta que sempre surge est\u00e1 relacionada a varia\u00e7\u00e3o desta forma \n\nde gera\u00e7\u00e3o de energia el\u00e9trica com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o alternante durante o dia \n\ndevido ao movimento das nuvens e total aus\u00eancia no per\u00edodo noturno. \n\nMesmo assim, em alguns pa\u00edses, j\u00e1 se atinge percentuais em torno de 5 a \n\n10% de contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da energia el\u00e9trica proveniente de energia solar \n\nfotovoltaica. Passa a ser desafiador a inser\u00e7\u00e3o dessa fonte de energia \u00e0 \n\nrede, de maneira intensiva, em paralelo com os recursos j\u00e1 existentes (em \n\nsua maioria ainda de origem f\u00f3ssil). Nesta tese, foi avaliada a previs\u00e3o do \n\nrecurso solar em curt\u00edssimo prazo (como 15-min, 30-min e uma hora) para \n\numa regi\u00e3o tropical do planeta, neste caso em Cingapura, ilha que se \n\nlocaliza pr\u00f3xima \u00e0 linha do equador, no Sudeste Asi\u00e1tico. Esta tese foca \n\nem m\u00e9todos existentes de previs\u00e3o de irradi\u00e2ncia, mas tamb\u00e9m explora \n\numa nova proposta h\u00edbrida, adaptada a uma localidade tropical. Al\u00e9m das \n\nprevis\u00f5es de irradia\u00e7\u00e3o solar, simula\u00e7\u00f5es de sistemas fotovoltaicos e o \n\nc\u00e1lculo de seu desempenho foram estudados e avaliados de modo a se \n\nprever quanto de energia el\u00e9trica \u00e9 produzida com a mesma anteced\u00eancia \n\ndada nos produtos de previs\u00e3o do recurso solar. A influ\u00eancia da gaze de \n\nqueimada foi um fen\u00f4meno particular, comum na Cingapura de hoje, que \n\nafeta o desempenho de sistemas fotovoltaicos e que foi investigado em \n\ndetalhe. Todo o trabalho foi validado por redes detalhadas de esta\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nmeteorol\u00f3gicas em solo e tamb\u00e9m atrav\u00e9s de monitoramento de sistemas \n\nfotovoltaicos por toda Cingapura. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: irradia\u00e7\u00e3o solar, previs\u00e3o da irradia\u00e7\u00e3o solar, sistemas \nfotovoltaicos conectados \u00e0 rede, simula\u00e7\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise de desempenho de \n\nsistemas fotovoltaicos, regi\u00f5es tropicais.  \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nHumanity has used and continues to consume in great proportion non-\n\nrenewable energy resources of the planet such as oil, natural gas and coal \n\nin order to fulfil its energy needs. It was only during the past two decades \n\nthat other sources of renewable energy such as solar photovoltaics (PV) \n\nand wind energy became somewhat relevant towards electricity \n\ngeneration in the world. PV installations worldwide have reached a \n\ncompound annual growth rate of ~40% for the last fifteen years. However, \n\nthe great majority of these systems (over 90% of them) are located where \n\nthe solar energy resource is not the most abundant \u2013 outside of the tropical \n\nregions of the planet. While trying to incorporate solar energy PV into \n\nelectrical power grids, one common question which arises is related to the \n\nvariable aspect of this form of energy generation \u2013 with alternating \n\nproduction during the day due to cloud motion, and total absence during \n\nnight time. Nonetheless, in some countries, contribution ratios of 5 to 10% \n\nof electrical energy from solar PV have been achieved. It becomes then \n\nchallenging to integrate this source of energy into grids in a professional \n\nway, in parallel with existing resources (mostly still fossil-fuel-based). In \n\nthis thesis, short-term forecasting (for time horizons such as 15-min, 30-\n\nmin and 1-hour) of the solar resource was investigated in a tropical region \n\nof the world \u2013 in Singapore, 1\u00b0 North of the Equator, in Southeast Asia. \n\nThis thesis focuses on existing methods for irradiance forecasting, but \n\nalso explores a novel Hybrid proposal, tailored to the tropical \n\nenvironment at hand. Beyond the forecast of the solar energy irradiance \n\nahead of time, PV system simulation and performance assessment were \n\nstudied and evaluated with the goal of predicting how much electricity is \n\nproduced in the same time frame given by the solar irradiance forecasting \n\nproducts. The influence of haze was a particular phenomenon, common \n\nin today\u2019s Singapore, which affects PV system performance and which \n\nwas investigated in detail. All work has been validated by a \n\ncomprehensive network of ground-based meteorological stations, as well \n\nas by various PV system monitoring sites throughout Singapore. \n\n \nKeywords: solar irradiation, solar irradiation forecasting, grid-\n\nconnected PV systems, PV systems simulation and performance \n\nassessment, tropical regions. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFIGURE LIST \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Solar photovoltaics worldwide growth from 2000 to 2014 (SPE, \n\n2015) ..................................................................................................... 38 \nFigure 2: Annually deployed and cumulative volumes of photovoltaic \n\nsystems in Brazil (ANTONIOLLI et al., 2014). ................................... 40 \nFigure 3: 1.42 MWp at the Mineir\u00e3o Stadium in Belo Horizonte, MG \n\n(CEMIG, 2013). .................................................................................... 42 \nFigure 4: 3 MWp at the UFSC/Tractebel R&amp;D facility in Tubar\u00e3o, SC \n\n(Source: Fotovoltaica/UFSC). ............................................................... 42 \nFigure 5: Quarterly and cumulatively installed PV capacity in Singapore \n\nfor the 2012-2014 time period (NSR, 2015c). ....................................... 43 \nFigure 6: Annual electricity demand and gross domestic product growth \n\nin Singapore for the 2005-2014 period, adapted from (EMA, 2013). ... 44 \nFigure 7: Electricity generation fuel type in Singapore for the 2009-2015 \n\nperiod, adapted from (EMA, 2013). ...................................................... 45 \nFigure 8: Daily energy consumption pattern for Singapore during a week \n\nin May 2015 (left), as well as progression of peak demand for the period \n\nof 2012-2015 (right), adapted from (EMA, 2013). ............................... 46 \nFigure 9: PV systems in Singapore exemplifying the urbanization of solar \n\nphotovoltaics (NSR, 2015b). ................................................................. 47 \nFigure 10: Location of the top-ten solar PV markets of the world as of \n\nend of 2014, adapted from (IEA, 2014c). .............................................. 50 \nFigure 11: A so-called \u201cSumatra squall\u201d with an approaching storm \n\noriginating from Indonesia as captured by Doppler radar images in 10-\n\nmin intervals, adapted from (NEA, 2012). ............................................ 52 \nFigure 12: A residential 8.6 kWp PV system in Singapore with thin-film \n\nmodules and two inverters (NSR, 2013c). ............................................ 57 \nFigure 13: An industrial 300.4 kWp PV system at the REC facility in \n\nTuas, Singapore with polycrystalline modules (NSR, 2013c)............... 58 \nFigure 14: A 3.6 kWp monocrystalline PV system in a residence in Belo \n\nHorizonte, Brazil (SPB, 2012). ............................................................. 58 \nFigure 15: Desert Sunlight Solar Farm (550 MWac PV plant), built in \n\nCalifornia (FIRST_SOLAR, 2013). ...................................................... 59 \nFigure 16: 1.2 MWp floating PV system at the Okegawa (left) and 1.7 \n\nMWp Hyogo (right) prefectures in Japan (NIKKEI, 2013;

INTRODUCTION \n \n\n1.1 OVERVIEW \n\nHumanity\u2019s modern energy utilization pattern has relied heavily on \n\nfossil-fuels. The primary sources consumed through the years were, and \n\nare oil, coal and natural gas (IEA, 2014a). Through the past many \n\ndecades, some countries successfully implemented renewable energy into \n\ntheir energy matrices \u2013 primarily hydropower \u2013 this being the case for \n\nlocations with abundant natural resources and privileged terrains. \n\nExamples of such nations are Canada, the United States, Brazil, China \n\nand Norway. Other types of renewable energy sources used by societies \n\nhave been vegetable coal, but primarily wood through time. It is only \n\nrecently that more modern forms of renewable energy such as solar \n\nphotovoltaics (PV), solar thermal, wind and geothermal have been added \n\nas energy generation sources in considerable volumes. \n\nThe presence of solar photovoltaics as a contributor to the electric \n\npower generation mix around the world has increased substantially during \n\nthe past two decades. From having crossed the 1 GWp\n1 installed capacity \n\nin year 2000, the world\u2019s total cumulative solar PV system deployment \n\nreached the 178 GWp-mark at the end of 2014, which is equivalent to a \n\ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~40% over the mentioned 15-\n\nyear period. Figure 1 illustrates this exponential growth in the mentioned \n\ntime window (SPE, 2015). \n\nEspecially in countries with high adoption of photovoltaics, the \n\nsolar power fed into the electric grid can contribute to a considerable \n\namount of peak demand needs. On 18th August 2014, as an example, \n\n~25% of the peak domestic demand in Germany was met by \n\nphotovoltaics. Adding its capacities from wind and biomass sources, it \n\nwas already the case that ~75% of the energy needs of Germany, a country \n\nwith a population of circa 80 million people, were fully powered by \n\nrenewables at least for a given moment in time on the mentioned day \n\n(RENEWABLES_INTERNATIONAL, 2014). \n\nGermany has led the way in solar photovoltaic implementation \n\nworldwide, with 38.2 GWp of installed PV capacity deployed by 2014 \n\n(IEA, 2014c). These installations accounted for 5.7% of the entire \n\ncountry\u2019s electricity needs in 2014 (AGEB, 2014). In the Southern state \n\n                                                        \n1 Wp = Watt-peak. As per International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards (IEC, 2011) for the \n\ngauging of photovoltaic modules, the Standard Test Conditions (STC) are the laboratory test conditions of \n\n1,000 W/m2 of irradiance, 25\u00b0C of PV cell temperature and spectral distribution of light equivalent to 1.5 AM \n\n(air mass). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n\nof Bavaria, where solar adoption is stronger due primarily to a more \n\ngenerous solar resource availability, the nearly half a million PV systems \n\n(equivalent to ~11 GWp of capacity) met circa 12% of the electricity \n\nneeds of the state in the same year (VBEW, 2014). The German Solar \n\nIndustry Association (BSW) expects that 10% of the entire electricity \n\nneeds of Germany will be covered by solar PV by 2020, followed by a \n\n20% contribution by 2030 (BSW, 2013). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Solar photovoltaics worldwide growth from 2000 to 2014 (SPE, \n\n2015) \n\nTable 1 illustrates where market leaders in solar PV adoption are \n\nlocated in the world, here as shown by a second source in IEA. As of the \n\nend of 2014, the top five markets for cumulative installed capacity were \n\nGermany, China, Japan, Italy, and the United States, with a considerable \n\ninstallation volume gap between the fifth spot and the remaining countries \n\nin the top-ten list \u2013 France, Spain, United Kingdom, Australia and \n\nBelgium. The entire European continent alone accounts for half of all \n\ninstalled PV power on the planet (IEA, 2014c). \n\nAll market leaders except for a portion of Australia are located \n\noutside of the tropical regions of the world, the areas between the tropics \n\nof Cancer (~23\u00b0N) and Capricorn (~23\u00b0S), also known as the sun-belt. \n\nThe tropics have higher levels of annual irradiation and are bound to \n\nexperience further strong growth rates in PV systems\u2019 implementation \n\ndue to continuing declining costs of the technology. Some of these \n\ncountries are India (2.94 GWp installed by 2014), Thailand (1.30 GWp), \n\nChile (0.60 GWp), Mexico (0.18 GWp) and Malaysia (0.16 GWp) (IEA, \n\n2014c). Chile is experiencing a surge in utility-scale PV installations to \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nserve the mining industry, with a number of large (upwards of 100 MWp) \n\npower plants installed or in the process of being installed at one of the \n\nsunniest sites on Earth, on the Atacama Desert. \n\nCountries which border the tropics have intensified the deployment \n\nof PV systems in recent years. Pakistan, which launched a 100 MWp solar \n\nfarm in a single location in 2014, will expand the facility to 1 GWp by \n\n2016 (PV-TECH, 2015). South Africa and Israel had deployed 0.92 and \n\n0.73 GWp, respectively, by the end of 2014 (IEA, 2014c). \n\nTable 1: Ten biggest markets for solar PV in the world at the end of 2014, \n\nadapted from (IEA, 2014c). \n\nRank Country Installed \n\ncapacity at the \n\nend of 2014 \n\n[GWp] \n\nPercentage of \n\nsolar PV world \n\nmarket \n\n1 Germany 38.2 21.6% \n\n2 China 28.2 15.9% \n\n3 Japan 23.3 13.2% \n\n4 Italy 18.5 10.5% \n\n5 United States 18.3 10.3% \n\n6 France 5.7 3.2% \n\n7 Spain 5.4 3.1% \n\n8 United Kingdom 5.1 2.9% \n\n9 Australia 4.1 2.3% \n\n10 Belgium 3.1 1.8% \n\n Rest of World 27.1 15.4% \n\n TOTAL 177.0 100.0% \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding the delayed growth for photovoltaic markets in \n\ntropical regions in comparison to other well-established, gigawatt-level \n\nlocations of the world, two countries have shown potential for a rapid PV \n\nroll-out \u2013 Brazil (in South America) and Singapore (in Southeast Asia). \n\nBrazil is poised to become one of the biggest adopters of the world \n\nof photovoltaic system deployment in the tropics. The 5th largest country \n\nin the world, both in area as well as in population (8.5 million km2 and \n\n~200 million inhabitants respectively), has an infant market in PV. The \n\ncountry has relied for more than half a century on power generated from \n\nhydroelectric plants, with the 14-GW power plant at the Itaipu dam as the \n\ncornerstone of the electrical generation system.  \n\nFor Brazil, which possesses a tropical climate in a considerable \n\npart of its territory, the PV deployment in absolute numbers is low in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n\ncomparison to market leaders, yet with a strong growth experienced in the \n\npast four years (CAGR = ~130%) as reported in (ANTONIOLLI et al., \n\n2014) and seen in Figure 2. Notwithstanding the low installed capacity of \n\ntoday, the targeted number of deployments for the future is promising \n\n(R\u00dcTHER and ZILLES, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Annually deployed and cumulative volumes of photovoltaic \n\nsystems in Brazil (ANTONIOLLI et al., 2014). \n\nMost of the existing photovoltaic systems in Brazil until 2011 had \n\nbeen off-grid smaller installations in remote areas where the electricity \n\ngrid is not available. An approximate volume of 20 MWp is scattered in \n\nmany areas of the country, connected to batteries in houses in remote \n\nvillages. However, this scenario is fast changing, which is already \n\nvisualized in the country\u2019s continuous energy mix transformation. \n\nIn its report entitled \u201cBalan\u00e7o Energ\u00e9tico Nacional \u2013 Ano Base \n\n2013\u201d (BEN, Brazilian Energy Balance \u2013 Year 2013), Empresa de \n\nPesquisa Energ\u00e9tica (EPE, Brazilian Energy Research Company) \n\ncomputed that ~46% of the entire Brazilian energy mix (primary matrix, \n\nincluding all energy sources) was met by renewable energy sources, \n\nwhich represents a much higher contribution than the world\u2019s average of \n\n~13%. If taking only electricity production into account, this ratio goes \n\nup to ~80%, one of the highest in the world (EPE, 2014).  \n\nThe overall contribution from renewables in electricity generation \n\nin Brazil has reduced from previous years though, as the usage of coal in \n\nthermoelectric power plants has increased, due to extended drought \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nperiods in the country. This aspect has generated momentum for solar PV \n\ndeployment. \n\nHydropower has provided ~70% of the electricity in Brazil and \n\nwind power has contributed enough to appear as a player \u2013 6.6 TWh \n\n(~1.1% of the total electricity production for the country of 570 TWh) \n\n(EPE, 2014). From 2005 to 2014, wind energy has had a decade run of \n\nCAGR of nearly 40%, reaching 2.2 GW of installed capacity at the end \n\nof 2014. \n\nIn order to produce 1 TWh of electricity, Brazil produces 8 times \n\nless greenhouse gas emissions than the United States, 5 times less than \n\nEurope and 12 times less than China (EPE, 2014). With such a clean \n\nenergy matrix, it is understandable why the PV market in the country has \n\ntaken longer to gain traction. Nonetheless, Brazil currently experiences a \n\nlate entrance in the solar PV game. On 17 April 2012, the Ag\u00eancia \n\nNacional de Energia El\u00e9trica (ANEEL, Brazilian Electricity Regulatory \n\nAgency) approved a new regulation allowing the connection to the grid \n\nof PV systems up to 100 kWp (named \u201cmicro-generation\u201d in the law) and \n\nbetween 100 kWp and 1 MWp (\u201cmini-generation\u201d) (ANEEL, 2012). In \n\nthis net-metering scheme, the extra energy generated on site and fed into \n\nthe grid is kept as a credit and can be used by the producer within a 36-\n\nmonth period. Alternatively, the credit can be transferred to another \n\nelectricity bill belonging to the same system owner. \n\n3.9 MWp and 10.7 MWp newly added PV volumes were connected \n\nto the grid in Brazil in 2013 and 2014, respectively, for a total market size \n\nof 17 MWp (ANTONIOLLI et al., 2014). With the push for renewables \n\ntaking a worldwide stance, together with falling system prices and the \n\nnewly approved regulation in Brazil, the first MW-level systems started \n\nto come online. Some of these MW-level were commissioned on top of \n\nstadiums prior to the 2014 Soccer World Cup, such as a 1.42 MWp \n\ninstallation at the Mineir\u00e3o Stadium in Belo Horizonte, MG (CEMIG, \n\n2013), see Figure 3, a 400 kWp system at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in Rio \n\nde Janeiro, RJ, a 400 kWp supporting arena for the World Cup at the \n\nPitua\u00e7u Stadium in Salvador, BA (AMERICA_DO_SOL, 2012), among \n\nothers.  \n\nSeveral systems were also installed under R&amp;D grants from \n\nANEEL, such as the 3 MWp test facility by the Universidade Federal de \n\nSanta Catarina (UFSC) and Tractebel in Santa Catarina (see Figure 4). \n\nMany years of healthy growth rates are expected, especially with \n\nexcellent solar resource throughout the country (1,400-2,400 \n\nkWh/(m2.year) (PEREIRA, E. B. et al., 2006). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: 1.42 MWp at the Mineir\u00e3o Stadium in Belo Horizonte, MG \n\n(CEMIG, 2013). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4: 3 MWp at the UFSC/Tractebel R&amp;D facility in Tubar\u00e3o, SC \n\n(Source: Fotovoltaica/UFSC). \n\nSingapore, located just North of the Equator (1.37\u00b0 N, 103.75\u00b0 E), \nalthough only a small city-state (land area = ~718 km2, population = 5.47 \n\nmillion as of 2014 (SDS, 2014)), possesses an expanding PV scene taking \n\nplace within a heavily-built environment. Even though it has only a small \n\nfraction of photovoltaics in its energy mix, this Asian tiger nation is a \n\ndemonstration on how PV is growing in nearby regions around the \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\ntropics. At the end of 2008, not even 1 MWp of PV systems were installed. \n\nHowever, within the following six years, the volume of installations shot \n\nup, with a CAGR of ~80%, with total installations currently at 33 MWp \n\n(see Figure 5). Many locations around the world have reached grid parity, \n\nthe moment in time when investing on a PV system is cheaper than \n\npurchasing electricity from the grid. This was also the case for tropical \n\nSingapore in 2012 (CHUA, 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5: Quarterly and cumulatively installed PV capacity in Singapore for \n\nthe 2012-2014 time period (NSR, 2015c). \n\nIn recent times, the Singapore government announced the \n\n\u201cSolarNova Program\u201d, where several agencies will use their building \n\nfeedstock to host circa 350 MWp of PV systems by 2020 (MTI, 2014). A \n\ntender call for the program was launched in June 2015, aiming at having \n\n40 MWp of PV capacity deployed by end of 2017 (CNA, 2015).  \n\nOn top of the SolarNova initiative, the Public Utilities Board \n\n(PUB) \u2013 the agency responsible for the water treatment and distribution \n\nin Singapore \u2013 is conducting a 3 MWp floating PV test-bed in an inland \n\nfresh water reservoir in the country (TODAY, 2014). The potential for \n\ndeployment of hundreds of megawatts of floating systems onto local \n\nreservoirs has been touted. All in all, Singapore could have ~1-2 GWp of \n\ncumulative solar PV systems deployed within the 2020-2030 year time \n\nspan (LUTHER and REINDL, 2013).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\nIn its year 2000 census (SDS, 2013), Singapore\u2019s population was \n\nreported at 4.03 million. Ten years later, in its most recent official survey, \n\nthe population had grown to 5.08 million (+26% nominal increase, +2.3% \n\nCAGR), mostly due to the inflow of foreigners as part of the government \n\nstrategy of economic growth (PMO, 2013). As a consequence of both \n\npopulation and economic spurts, energy utilization followed and can be \n\nvisualized in Figure 6, also for a decade, but for a more recent time range, \n\nin the energy consumption patterns for the country as seen in (for the \n\n2005-2014 timeframe, recorded CAGR of +2.9%). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Annual electricity demand and gross domestic product growth in \n\nSingapore for the 2005-2014 period, adapted from (EMA, 2013). \n\nIt can be seen that in 2014, the total consumed electricity in \n\nSingapore was close to 47 TWh. Assuming an installed capacity of solar \n\nPV in the country of 33 MWp and a PV system annual energy generation \n\npotential of 1.08 MWh/(kWp per year), as analyzed by the National Solar \n\nRepository of Singapore (NSR, later discussed in sub-section 2.5.5 (NSR, \n\n2015d)), electricity production arising from solar PV for the year could \n\nbe estimated at ~35 GWh, or only 0.08% of the total amount of electricity \n\nconsumed in the country in 2014. There is still considerable room for \n\ngrowth of the local PV market, which could make a promising case as a \n\nsource of renewable energy for the future (LUTHER and REINDL, 2013). \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\nFigure 7 shows that the majority of the electrical energy generation \n\ncapacity in Singapore runs on fossil-fuels (oil for steam units and natural \n\ngas powering combined-cycle gas turbines, CCGT).  Only a small portion \n\ncan be linked to other sources of generation, in which solar would have a \n\nsmall percentage thereof. Due to idled capacities, oil-fired generators \n\nhave been turned off starting in 2012. This has caused the electricity \n\nmatrix of Singapore to become somewhat cleaner, since the CCGT plants \n\nare less polluting. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Electricity generation fuel type in Singapore for the 2009-2015 \n\nperiod, adapted from (EMA, 2013). \n\nAnother aspect pertaining to the Singapore economy is that the \n\nmajority of fossil-fuels powering energy generation come from imports \n\ndue to the absence of local natural resources. Singapore was the 8th \n\nhighest world importer of oil products in 2012, as per the International \n\nEnergy Agency (IEA) (IEA, 2014a). This is yet another reason why the \n\nlocal government has shown the commitment to invest in renewables, \n\nnamely photovoltaics, due to the abundant solar resource in the tropical \n\nnation (long-term average annual irradiation = 1,631 kWh/m2), in order \n\nto reduce its dependency on foreign sources of energy (MEWR, 2009). \n\nIn general, the electricity load of the country peaks at close to 6.5 \n\nGW in the months of May and June, when ambient temperatures reach \n\nthe highest values of the year. Figure 8 (left) (EMA, 2015)) shows the \n\ndemand pattern for a May week in the country, when there is a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\npronounced increase in the usage of air-conditioners (as an example). \n\nWith the entire generation capacity of Singapore resting at ~12.8 GW \n\n(EMC, 2015), the peak represents only ~55% of the total authorized \n\ngeneration capacity, highlighting a robust reserve for the system, mainly \n\ndriven by security issues. Also seen from Figure 8 (right) is the \n\nprogressive increase in the energy demand curve for Singapore through \n\nthe years, a phenomenon which can be partially explained by an increase \n\nin population as previously mentioned. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Daily energy consumption pattern for Singapore during a week in \n\nMay 2015 (left), as well as progression of peak demand for the period of \n\n2012-2015 (right), adapted from (EMA, 2013). \n\nThe speed of installation of photovoltaic systems for the years \n\nahead could represent a rapid change of the energy landscape in \n\nSingapore, potentially making the island one of the places with the highest \n\nconcentration of PV capacity in a city setting in the world (excluding open \n\nfield solar farms). Figure 9 shows some examples of the urbanization of \n\nphotovoltaics \u2013 a skyscraper at the Central Business District of Singapore \n\n(CBD) with a 75 kWp PV system on its rooftop and a building integrated \n\nphotovoltaic (BIPV) system on a residence at a residential condominium \n\nin Singapore. BIPV deployment worldwide is also targeted to experience \n\nstrong growth rates ahead (PIKE, 2012), which would continue to \n\npromote the \u201curban solar\u201d wave. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nFigure 9: PV systems in Singapore exemplifying the urbanization of solar \n\nphotovoltaics (NSR, 2015b). \n\nTable 2 aims at presenting a vision of the future (+15 years) where \n\nthe growth of the population and of PV system deployment for Germany \n\nand Singapore are contrasted. With an equivalent 2.8 MWp of PV per km\n2 \n\nof country area, Singapore is poised to have one of the densest fleets of \n\nPV systems in the world. \n\nTable 2: Potential growth for photovoltaics and associated country metrics \n\nin Singapore and Germany, adapted from (EMA, 2014; IEA, 2014b). \n\nCountry Population in   \n\n2014                        \n\n[million \n\ninhabitants] \n\nPopulation in \n\n20302                        \n\n[million \n\ninhabitants] \n\nPV volume \n\nin 2014              \n\n[in GWp] \n\nPV volume \n\nin 20303              \n\n[in GWp] \n\nSingapore     \n(718 km\n\n2\n) \n\n5.47 7.51 0.33 2.00 \n\nGermany \n(357x10\n\n3\n km\n\n2\n) \n\n80.72 87.43 38.2 56.7 \n\nCountry Watts per capita \n\nin 2014 \n\nWatts per capita \n\nin 2030 \n\nkW per \n\nkm2 in 2014 \n\nkW per \n\nkm2 in 2030 \n\nSingapore     \n(718 km\n\n2\n) \n\n~5 ~270 ~45 ~2,800 \n\nGermany \n(357x10\n\n3\n km\n\n2\n) \n\n~475 ~650 ~110 ~160 \n\n                                                        \n2 For Germany, population growth is assumed 0.5% p.a., whereas for Singapore, a country experiencing much \n\nhigher economic growth rates, the population growth assumed is 2.0% p.a., in line with (SDS, 2014). \n3 For Germany, PV growth is assumed to be 2.5% p.a., in line with an already mature and saturated solar \n\nmarket. For Singapore, it follows strong expansion rate premises set in (LUTHER and REINDL, 2013). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n\nAs observed thus far in this overview, the deployment rate of solar \n\nPV systems worldwide has been considerable, with locations in the \n\ntropics now gaining momentum. With deeper levels of penetration of \n\nsolar PV intro grids, its professional and smooth integration becomes the \n\nnext challenge. Some high penetration level examples are Italy (~8% of \n\nthe total electricity generation), Germany (~6%) and Greece (~6%) (IEA, \n\n2014c). For those countries, solar can already account for a considerable \n\namount of the peak demand. When higher shares of peak PV are \n\nconcerned, the island of Kauai, in Hawaii already has ~80% contribution \n\ncoming from solar PV (FAIRLEY, 2015). \n\nApart from the massive growth rates reported, the up-and-coming \n\nchallenge of solar PV lies on its integration impact onto the grid due to \n\nhigh solar power penetration levels, as previously mentioned, and its \n\nvariability, a characteristic of the technology. Varying power output \n\noriginates questions and concerns from the utility standpoint, especially \n\nin a tropical environment, with high cloudiness indices and erratic cloud \n\nmotion (discussed in detail in section 2.3). Other questions arising on top \n\nof the variability of the power flow of PV systems itself are associated \n\nwith voltage and frequency fluctuations, reverse and additional power \n\nflows and anti-islanding (if solar inverters will disconnect from the grid \n\nin case the latter is unavailable) (BRAUN et al., 2012; STETZ et al., \n2015). For that reason, a new International Energy Agency Task Force \n\nwas created within the Photovoltaic Power Systems Program, Task 14, \n\nnamed \u201cHigh Penetration of PV Systems in Electricity Grids\u201d (IEA, \n\n2011). Among the goals of Task 14 are to work closely with utilities, \n\nindustry players and stakeholders in developing technologies and \n\nmethods to enable the widespread deployment of distributed, grid-\n\nconnected PV systems. \n\nLarge-scale, non-rapid dispatch forms of electrical energy \n\ngeneration, namely nuclear, hydro or thermoelectric power plants have a \n\nlonger start-up time. As an example, a 285 MW hydropower Francis \n\nturbine running with no load (at its \u201cspeed no load\u201d setting) would take \n\n3-min to start producing electricity, upon a decision to generate is made. \n\nIf the turbine is completely stopped, the time between decision and \n\ngeneration would be around 10-min. As another example, a \n\nthermoelectric power plant on total stoppage would take many hours until \n\nreaching an operational condition where electricity can be generated. \n\nEven for a situation when there is ready steam for the turbines, a stopped \n\nunit could take up to 30-min upon generation and synchronism with the \n\ngrid. \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nGas turbines in Singapore and elsewhere can be part of spinning \n\nreserve systems, or energy generation potential that could be turned on at \n\na relatively shorter period of time. The integration of all these sources of \n\nenergy generation together with solar PV will be one of the technical \n\nchallenges of this century. \n\nDue to such increasing shares of PV in the generation mix and the \n\nvariability associated with the solar technology, solar irradiance \n\nforecasting has gained momentum to assist grid operators meeting load \n\ndemand and performing a smooth balancing between conventional \n\nelectricity generation and solar PV and/or other variable renewable \n\nsources (e.g. wind). Forecasting irradiance for regulation (short-term \n\ninterval horizons, which can act as complement to the grid), as well as for \n\ngrid scheduling and unit commitment (for one-day ahead forecasts or \n\ntimes beyond that horizon), are paramount.  \n\nKnowledge of the future output of the sun\u2019s irradiance and \n\nconsequently the energy generation on a PV system under a particular \n\nirradiance level becomes crucial in bridging a future where renewable and \n\nnon-renewable power sources work concurrently to meet the world\u2019s \n\nelectricity needs. This thesis addresses some of these challenges.  \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n\n1.2 MOTIVATION \n\nAs seen in Table 1, the majority of the installed solar PV capacity \n\nof the world is located in Europe, United States and Japan, with China \n\nmore recently climbing the ranks all the way to number two. Derived from \n\nthat table, it can be observed from Figure 10 that the top-ten PV markets \n\nare located outside of the sun-belt region of the world, with the exception \n\nof a portion of Northern Australia and a small part of China. It can be \n\ninferred that more than 90% of all PV systems on the planet are not \n\nlocated in the tropics, which encompass the most solar-abundant regions \n\nof the world. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10: Location of the top-ten solar PV markets of the world as of end \n\nof 2014, adapted from (IEA, 2014c). \n\nConsequently, it is not unusual that solar PV research efforts have \n\nbeen conducted by research centers located in temperate locations of the \n\nworld, with some examples being the National Renewable Energy \n\nLaboratory (NREL) in the United States, the Fraunhofer Institute for \n\nSolar Energy Systems (ISE) in Germany, and the National Institute of \nAdvanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan, among \n\nother renowned centers in countries like France and The Netherlands. \n\nAdditionally, the majority of the R&amp;D efforts on the topic of PV system \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nfield performance are, in its large capacity, focused on installations at \n\ncountries at the top-ten list of markets in the world. \n\nIt was also reported in section 1.1 the growth of PV systems and \n\ntheir role as major contributors to the electricity mix in countries. As \n\nratios of solar PV in energy mixes climb from negligible towards \n\nconsiderable levels (10% and beyond), work in the area of solar irradiance \n\nforecasting starts to become increasingly relevant for the management of \n\nelectricity grids. Consequently, solar resource estimation ahead of time is \n\nvital if desired to be an integral part of the entire energy generation \n\noperations from a utility stand-point, when regulating energy production \n\ndispatch of fossil-fuel based power generation. \n\nClassical weather forecast (in terms of temperatures and \n\nprecipitation) has reached nearly 100% accuracy for one day ahead and \n\n70% of accuracy for five days anticipation in many parts of the world. For \n\nPV applications, where the sunlight intensity, or solar irradiance, is the \n\nobject of interest, accuracies depend on time horizons of choice (from \n\nminutes up to a couple of days ahead) and region of the world (a temperate \n\nweather region is likely to have less cloud coverage in comparison to a \n\ntropical region). The forecast time horizons will dictate forecasting \n\nproducts, tailored for stakeholders (such as utilities) for their dispatch and \n\ncommitment cycles of fossil-fuel and other sources of energy generation. \n\nThis thesis focuses on solar irradiance forecasting for a tropical climate \n\nin Singapore and a critical time frame from the local utility\u2019s perspective \n\n\u2013 short-term intervals (from a few minutes up to 1-hr ahead of time), \n\nespecially since electricity is traded in Singapore at 30-min intervals \n\n(EMA, 2013).  \n\nAn added motivation for the case study in Singapore is the \n\nrelatively small size of the island-state, with its ~720 km2 of area and only \n\na small interconnection to the Malaysian power grid. The variability \n\nwhich can arise from PV systems due to the weather poses a much larger \n\nrisk since the geographical smoothing effect is reduced. Drastic weather \n\nvariations in Singapore (e.g. due to fast approaching storms common in \n\nthe tropics, see example in Figure 11) make short-term solar irradiance \n\nforecasting a crucial part of PV grid integration and to properly manage \n\nand balance the grid.  \n\nResearch on solar irradiance forecasting for PV applications is \n\nconsiderably new (less than 10 years of publications as described later in \n\nsection 2.4), and when tropical regions are the object of study, the work \n\nis altogether novel. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nFigure 11: A so-called \u201cSumatra squall\u201d with an approaching storm \n\noriginating from Indonesia as captured by Doppler radar images in 10-min \n\nintervals, adapted from (NEA, 2012).  \n\nSolar irradiance forecasting is just the first mechanism in \n\nimproving grid operations with a large share of renewables. The process \n\nof creating a resilient grid relies on further understanding of the \n\nconversion steps from irradiance all the way into final electricity for end \n\nusers. To make matters more difficult, the area of PV systems \n\nperformance modeling and assessment is still in its infancy for tropical \n\nregions, as it would be expected from the absence of relevant volumes of \n\ninstallations in these locations.  \n\nAs an example, and mentioned in section 1.1, having solar PV \n\nsystems in a densely-built environment, be it Singapore or other \n\nmetropolises in the future, will create integration hurdles for the \n\ntechnology into existing building feedstock. The influence of shading \n\nfrom nearby buildings and structures exemplifies such integration \n\nchallenges, but which can be mitigated (ZOMER et al., 2014). \n\nIn this thesis, methods for short-term irradiance forecasting are \n\nexecuted for ground-measured solar irradiance data in Singapore and \n\nbenchmarked. Also as part of the work, an attempt to develop a novel \n\nmethod to reduce prediction errors is developed. The discovery of areas \n\nof improvement helps delineate a path for similar work which could be \n\nexperienced by other researchers in areas with similar weather patterns \n\naround the globe. Studying these extreme weather conditions as the one \n\nshown in Figure 11 and their effect on a growing number of solar \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nphotovoltaic systems are topics of great interest to local power system \n\noperators.   \n\nThe work of this doctoral thesis will therefore focus on pressing \n\ntopics such as assessment of the solar energy resource ahead of time, but \n\nat the same time taking into account the amount of solar electricity \n\ngenerated at the end producer, after a PV system goes through its known \n\nloss mechanisms process. Therefore, the motivation and relevance behind \n\nthis thesis stem from two fronts and can be summarized as follows: \n\n \n\n? The increasing share of photovoltaics in electricity grids around \nthe world has been overwhelming. PV will play a major role in \n\nfuture energy mixes. Forecasting of the solar resource will be key \n\nin coordinating dispatch and management of the existing power \n\ngeneration resources based primarily on fossil-fuels; \n\n \n\n? The massive amounts of PV systems being deployed around the \nworld and the need to understand their day-to-day and long-term \n\nbehavior and optimization aspects. The output of systems, with \n\nthe understanding of the entire flow mechanism from point A \n\n(\u201cirradiance availability\u201d) all the way to point B (\u201ckWh \n\ndelivered\u201d), is and will be crucial. \n\n \n\nWork on irradiance forecasting is pioneer in the climatic region of \n\nthe world proposed here. Additionally, PV systems modeling, simulation \n\nand validation has also not been investigated extensively in sun-belt \n\ncountries. \n\nFinally, as the world moves increasingly towards the so-called \n\n\u201csmart grids\u201d, mechanisms such as trading of energy, variable tariffs and \n\nreal-time controlled production &amp; demand of electricity become \u201chot \n\ntopics\u201d. Thus, subjects such as the predictability of renewable energy \n\nsolar assets are more and more relevant moving forward with the aim of \n\nforecasting, for example, PV system output ahead of time. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n54 \n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES \n\n1.3.1 Main Objectives \n\nThe main objectives of this thesis are to: \n\n \n\na) Evaluate and compare short-term forecast methods for \nsolar irradiance in Singapore, taking into consideration the \n\nchallenging meteorological conditions found in tropical \n\nregions, minimizing loss of precision from the forecasts; \n\nand \n\n \n\nb) As a final use of the forecast products originated in a), \nsimulate, determine and validate generated solar PV \n\nsystems\u2019 energy output ahead of time. \n\n1.3.2 Specific Objectives \n\nThe specific objectives of this thesis are to: \n\n \n\n?

Make proposals &amp; assumptions of forecasting &amp; PV \nsystem behavior for utility stakeholders in Singapore. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS \n\nThe thesis is structured such that chapter 1 presented an overview \n\nof the status quo of solar photovoltaics around the world and most notably \nin the tropics. Also within the chapter, the motivation behind this work \n\nwas given, followed by the main and specific objectives of the thesis. \n\nChapter 2 provides a detailed literature review surrounding topics \n\nsuch as the modern state of PV systems technology, solar irradiance \n\nresource basics, the typical climate found in the tropics (and specifically \n\nfor the case study of Singapore), the state-of-the-art of solar irradiance \n\nforecasting and finally PV system simulation &amp; performance assessment \n\nconsiderations. \n\nChapter 3 touches on the methods proposed for the works \n\ncontained in this thesis. It introduces how data was collected and how it \n\nwas used in order to obtain the results presented in chapter 4, as well as \n\ndiscussions arising from the findings. \n\nChapter 5 summarizes the outcome of this work together with \n\nlikely limitations encountered which in turn fuel suggestions for future \n\nworks in the field.  \n\nChapter 6 presents the publications derived from this thesis and \n\nother works by the author. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n56 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n \n\n2.1 SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS \n\n2.1.1 Solar PV systems technology \n\nPhotovoltaics (or commonly known as PV) is the static and direct \n\nconversion of sunlight into electricity (DGS, 2008). A classic PV system \n\nis made primarily of a combination of photovoltaic modules (Figure 12 \n\nleft, mounted onto a residence\u2019s rooftop as an example (NSR, 2013c)) \n\nconnected in series forming strings. These strings are then hooked up in \n\nparallel to solar inverters (Figure 12 right), which convert the produced \n\nDC (direct current) power from the modules into AC (alternate current) \n\npower, then fed into the grid of the building. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12: A residential 8.6 kWp PV system in Singapore with thin-film \n\nmodules and two inverters (NSR, 2013c). \n\nSmaller PV installations such as the 8.6 kWp thin-film system \n\nshown in Figure 12 are usually connected to low-voltage, single-phase \n\ngrids (230 VAC, 50 Hz for the case of Singapore). Bigger systems, such as \n\nthe 300.4 kWp polycrystalline setup at the Renewable Energy Corporation \n\n(REC) solar wafer, cell and module plant in Singapore (Figure 13, (NSR, \n\n2013c)), might be connected to the medium-voltage grid of the facilities \n\nin which they are hosted. \n\nSimilar systems are flourishing in other tropical locations of the \nworld, such as Brazil, as it could be seen in Figure 3 for the case of a \n\nmedium-voltage connected system and Figure 14 for the first residential \n\nPV system connected to the electricity grid in the state of Minas Gerais, \n\nlocated in the city of Belo Horizonte, a 3.6 kWp monocrystalline setup \n\n(SPB, 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13: An industrial 300.4 kWp PV system at the REC facility in Tuas, \n\nSingapore with polycrystalline modules (NSR, 2013c). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14: A 3.6 kWp monocrystalline PV system in a residence in Belo \n\nHorizonte, Brazil (SPB, 2012). \n\nCrystalline silicon wafer-based technologies have lead most of the \ndevelopment of solar photovoltaics. Its presence can be linked to 80-90% \n\nof the PV systems found in the world (SOLARBUZZ, 2013b). Thin-film \n\namorphous silicon and other variants like microcrystalline, had a spurt of \n\ngrowth around the year 2005, increasing their market share from 10% to \n\nclose to 20%. That was especially the case since a raw material bottleneck \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\noccurred (2006-2008), favoring the rise of thin-film systems, which \n\nutilize less silicon for their production. However, due to ongoing \n\nconsolidation in the PV manufacturing sector and continuous preference \n\ntowards crystalline-based technology systems, thin-film products have \n\nbeen further diluted back to ~10% and below of the total market volume. \n\nMonocrystalline silicon cell efficiency record is achieved with the \n\ndeposition of a heterojunction intrinsic layer (\u201cHIT cells\u201d as trademarked \n\nby Sanyo, later acquired by Panasonic). The most recent record as of 2015 \n\nstands at 25.6%. For multicrystalline silicon, the record efficiency is \n\n20.8% (GREEN et al., 2015). In terms of other PV technologies, cadmium \n\ntelluride (CdTe) modules and systems have been heavily deployed by \n\nAmerican company First Solar. During tough economic market \n\nconditions (2011-2013), the company performed well and deployed MW-\n\nsize solar parks primarily in the United States (see the 550 MWac solar \n\nfarm in Figure 15 (FIRST_SOLAR, 2013)). First Solar announced in \n\n2015 a breakthrough record efficiency of 21.5% for its CdTe cells \n\n(PV_MAGAZINE, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15: Desert Sunlight Solar Farm (550 MWac PV plant), built in \n\nCalifornia (FIRST_SOLAR, 2013). \n\nApart from efficiency improvements in solar cell technologies, a \n\ncurrent trend in crystalline wafer-based modules is the launch of bifacial \n\nproducts, glass-glass laminates which allow light to go through the panel, \n\nwhich then bounces off the ground/roof underneath, returning partially to \n\nthe panel, boosting its power output. \n\nAnother recent frontier in photovoltaic system deployment has \n\nbeen the launch of \u201cfloating PV systems\u201d. These systems have been aimed \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\nat minimizing land resource utilization, especially for area-stricken \n\ncountries such as Japan or Singapore (NCCS, 2011). Other mentioned \n\nbenefits of floating PV are the extra cooling provided by the water to the \n\npanels, thus allowing for a higher energy harvesting, as well as ability of \n\nthe system to prevent algae growth (TRAPANI and RED\u00d3N SANTAF\u00c9, \n\n2015). Figure 16 shows two MW-level floating PV systems deployed in \n\nJapan in fresh water canals and reservoirs (NIKKEI, 2013; \n\nTECHXPLORE, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16: 1.2 MWp floating PV system at the Okegawa (left) and 1.7 MWp \n\nHyogo (right) prefectures in Japan (NIKKEI, 2013; TECHXPLORE, 2015). \n\nIn terms of how different PV technologies react to the sun\u2019s \n\nelectromagnetic irradiation, Figure 17 shows the relative spectral \n\nresponses of different PV modules (multicrystalline Si (silicon), \n\namorphous Si, CdTe and CIGS). The single-junction a-Si module has a \n\npeak response at around 600 nm and is able to convert light into electricity \n\nfrom ~320-800 nm. For the CdTe module technology, the corresponding \n\nrange is 300-900 nm. The spectral response range for the CIGS module is \n\naround 350-1150 nm, similar to that of a crystalline silicon wafer-based \n\nmodule (LIU et al., 2014b). \n\nModules are the driving force of the system, with the remaining \n\n\u201cbalance of systems\u201d (commonly abbreviated as BOS) composed by \n\ninverters, mounting systems (for the interface between modules and \n\nground/rooftop/floats), DC and AC cabling &amp; switches/isolators, surge \n\nprotections, etc. Modules have historically represented the majority of the \n\ncost of a PV system (in the order of 70% of the total cost), but this ratio \n\nhas drastically changed, falling to around 50% in 2015 (see section 2.1.2).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nFigure 17: Relative spectral response of various PV technologies \n\n(multicrystalline Si, amorphous Si, CdTe and CIGS), measured under STC \n\ntemperature (25\u00b0C), with the AM1.5G spectrum (grey) also shown as \n\nreference (LIU et al., 2014b). \n\nAs much as solar PV can and have caused enthusiasm in governments \n\nand population for a faster rollout, a few aspects historically prevent even \n\nfaster growth rates. They can be named as follows: \n\n \n\n? Cost-competitiveness of photovoltaics (discussed in 2.1.2); \n \n\n? Grid integration challenges (discussed in 2.1.3); \n \n\n? Variability aspect of the energy generation profile from PV \n(discussed in 2.1.4); \n\nApart from the various challenges discussed next, solar PV has a \n\nbright future, as covered in subsection 2.1.5 with a market outlook.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n62 \n\n2.1.2 Cost-competitiveness of photovoltaics \n\nPV module prices, which have historically dictated the overall cost \n\nof a system, have reduced drastically (~60%) during the 2009-2013 \n\nperiod (SOLARBUZZ, 2013a), and were responsible for about only half \n\nof a PV system cost in 2014 (BSW, 2014). Consolidation happened in the \n\nmodule manufacturing industry, with several companies closing doors or \n\nacquired by other players. Big name companies such as Bosch exited the \n\nsolar market altogether after major losses reported (PV-TECH, 2013). \n\nTraditionally, even well-established companies experienced turbulence in \n\nthe PV business, with recent episodes such as former world number one \n\nSuntech (China) being acquired, and also other Chinese players in \n\nHanergy and Yingli going through unstable periods (BLOOMBERG, \n\n2015; WALL_STREET_JOURNAL, 2015). The price learning curve of \n\nphotovoltaics (Figure 18) shows that with each doubling of the installed \n\nPV capacity worldwide, prices have come down by ~20% for the 34-year \n\nperiod (ISE, 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18: Price learning curve of photovoltaics (ISE, 2014). \n\nAs previously mentioned, the price of a PV system relied heavily \n\non the solar module as the main component (circa 60-70% of the total \n\ninvestment). With the price erosion of the past years, the scenario has \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\nreversed and BOS components now account to ~50% of the cost of a \n\nrooftop PV system in Germany (see Figure 19) (BSW, 2014), thus \n\nshifting some of the pressure to inverter makers and system integrators in \n\ngeneral to become more competitive. For a solar farm in the MW range, \n\nthe ratio could be even lower due to the likely economies of scale \n\nachieved when procuring solar panels in bulk volumes, and also to the \n\nfact that rooftop PV systems do not account for area-related costs, which \n\nis not the case for utility-scale, ground-mounted PV generators. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19: Evolution of average price for PV rooftop systems in Germany, \n\nincluding percentage of module cost in final system price (BSW, 2014). \n\nGrid parity has been reached in many locations throughout the \n\nworld, such as sunnier parts of the United States (California, Arizona, \n\netc.), Italy and Australia, but also locations with high grid retail prices, \n\nsuch as Germany, Japan, Brazil, among others. A schematic of this \n\nphenomenon can be seen in Figure 20, where a combination of rising grid \n\nelectricity prices (orange band, mostly pegged to oil prices) and declining \n\ncosts of PV (green band, achieved for example with mass scale production \n\nand innovation), eventually leverages PV to a competitive state against \nother forms of electricity generation (LUTHER, 2009). \n\nIn late 2012, it was announced that Singapore had reached grid-\n\nparity (STRAITS_TIMES, 2012) for bigger-size PV systems (> 500 kWp) \n\nversus grid retail electricity prices (of ~0.22 USD/kWh then). In 2015, \n\neven with declining worldwide oil prices causing grid tariffs to come \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n\ndown to nearly 0.15 USD/kWh, grid parity is still present across all PV \n\nproject sizes (BIERI et al., 2015).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20: Grid parity drivers (LUTHER, 2009). \n\nIn Brazil, depending on the local tariff and solar resource \n\nirradiation resource availability, grid parity has also been present since \n\n2012 (MONTENEGRO, 2013). \n\nIn order to understand corresponding costs of the PV technology \n\nin a net present value setting, equivalent to what a user would pay for \n\nelectricity tariff today and thus allowing for a more straight-forward \n\ncomparison with grid electricity prices, the levelized cost of electricity \n\n(LCOE) is introduced (Equation 1): \n\n \n\nLCOE = \nTotal life cycle cost\n\nTotal lifetime energy production\n (1) \n\n \n\nThe formula can be further expanded (Equation 2) where the total \n\nlife cost of the system is further developed into initial investment added \n\nto annual costs incurred (e.g. cleaning costs, if chosen), minus a \ndepreciation value and a final residual value at the end of the lifetime of \n\nthe system. This value is divided by the estimated yield of the system, \n\ndeducted from an annual system degradation rate. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n=\n??????? ????????????\n\n?????????????\n(?+???????? ????)?\n\n?\n?=? +?\n\n(?????? ????)?\n(?+???????? ????)?\n\n?\n???????? ?????\n\n(?+???????? ????)?\n?\n?=?  \n\n?\n??????? ??????(???????? ??????????? ????)?\n\n(?+???????? ????)?\n?\n?=?\n\n (2) \n\n \n\nA list of countries experiencing grid parity and the gap between \n\nsolar PV LCOE and electricity prices can be seen in Figure 21 \n\n(REUTER0053, 2015). As an example of this grid parity gauging as of \n\n2015, a LCOE for a solar PV system in Brazil would be estimated at ~18 \n\nUSD cents per kWh, whereas the grid electricity would be practically \n\ndouble of that, at ~36 USD cents per kWh. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21: Key countries around the world experiencing grid parity \n\n(REUTERS, 2015). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n66 \n\n2.1.3 Grid integration challenges  \n\nAs PV markets mature, such as the case of countries like Germany \n\nor Italy, deployment rates tend to stabilize (Germany ~8% CAGR \n\nbetween 2012 and 2014, Italy ~6%, values that are much lower than \n\nworldwide growth rates, ~33% for the same period). Nonetheless, the \n\nsteady deployment of systems, coupled with the adoption of energy \n\nefficiency practices, means more demand is met by photovoltaics, which \n\nbecome embedded and permanently relevant in a country\u2019s energy \n\ngeneration mix (at ~7% demand contribution levels for Germany, Italy \n\nand Greece (SPE, 2015)).  \n\nAs an example of photovoltaics as a massive contributor to a \n\ncountry\u2019s grid on a day-to-day basis, inverter manufacturer SMA uses \n\ndata output from PV systems in Germany under their portfolio to \n\nextrapolate power AC output data for the remainder capacity of the \n\ncountry in order to plot energy production graphs such as the ones shown \n\nin Figure 22 (SMA, 2015a). The total peak output power for a very sunny \n\nday in 2012 (25th May, shown on the top left of the figure), assuming a \n\nPV installed capacity in the country at that date of circa 27 GWp, was 21.1 \n\nGW. With Germany having peak power usage at circa 80 GW, that was \n\ntranslated into solar PV covering more than 1/4 of the needs of the entire \n\ncountry at that particular instant in time. In a check on the same website \n\nat near summer times of the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, the following \n\npeaks were obtained: 24.2, 25.9 and 27.6 GW, respectively. Between the \n\nfirst year shown in the figure (2012) and the fourth (2015), the peak has \n\njumped 6.5 GW, or a CAGR of 7%, in line with verified photovoltaic \n\nmarket growth rates.  \n\nAs much as Figure 22 showed peak days throughout Germany, \n\nwhich help with peak shaving but which, at certain occasions, forces \n\npower to be exported to nearby countries, Figure 23 highlights another \n\nconcern of utilities everywhere \u2013 days with varying power output among \n\nregions (left of the figure, with the example showing higher irradiance \n\nvalues in the South part of the country and cloudy conditions in the \n\nNorth); and days with very low production due to bad weather throughout \n\n(right of figure). In the example shown, the peak for the entire country on \n\nChristmas 2014 was registered to be only 4.2 GW, circa 15% of the high \n\nirradiance levels shown in Figure 22. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nFigure 22: Progressive solar PV production peaks in Germany from sunny \n\nday examples from 2012 to 2015, adapted from (SMA, 2015a). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23: Variable and low irradiation day examples in Germany in 2015, \n\nadapted from (SMA, 2015a). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\nInstallation rates in Europe are stabilizing at ~5% growth levels per \n\nannum. The moment in time when PV contributes considerably, even for \n\na short-period of time to the entire electrical system, is already upon \n\nutility grids. To somewhat add to the concern level normally associated \n\nwith PV, most of the National Renewable Action Plans (NREAPs) ended \n\nup far exceeding the expected targets for PV deployment set for the year \n\n2020, which have already been met in the majority of European countries \n\n(IEA, 2011). \n\nOther technical concerns arise from the presence of PV. A classic \n\nexample is anti-islanding, which is the ability of a PV inverter to \n\ndisconnect from the grid in case the latter is absent. Inverters will usually \n\ndisconnect from the grid if voltage is not detected after 0.2 milliseconds \n\n(SMA, 2013b). From Figure 24, other key inverter post-manufacturing \n\nquality checks, tailored to provide resilience to these devices and the grid, \n\ncan be seen. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24: Inverter quality assurance report, highlighting some of the tests \n\nwhich individual units go through (SMA, 2013b). \n\nAs the topic of grid integration for huge levels of PV was \nidentified, the IEA Photovoltaic Power System Program (PVPS) then \n\ncreated Task 14 with the goal of studying high penetration of PV systems \n\nin electricity grids. The Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) is the \n\noperating agent of the task and identified challenges in the power system \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\nand regional distribution levels for PV integration, as shown in Table 3 \n\n(AIT, 2012). \n\nTable 3: Challenges and solutions to large-scale PV systems integration \n\n(AIT, 2012) \n\nPower System Level Regional Distribution Level \n\nManaging variability of supply with \n\nPV \n\nManaging voltage profiles \n\nEnsuring security of supply Avoiding overloading components \n\nMatching supply and demand Transforming passive distribution into \n\nactive grids \n\nEnsuring frequency stability Integrating PV into smart grids \n\n \n\nGermany\u2019s grid has progressively experienced higher levels of \n\nsolar PV deployment as the years progressed. Figure 25 further depicts \n\nthis phenomenon with the reverse power flow observed at a 110/22 kV \n\nsubstation in the service area of Bayernwerk AG, in Southern Germany. \n\nIt can be detected that with the passing of time, the levels of AC power \n\nbeing fed into the grid increased summer by summer (STETZ et al., \n2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25: Power flow measured at 110/22 kV substation in Bavaria, South \n\nGermany, between 2009 and 2013 (STETZ et al., 2014). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n70 \n\nAs ratios of solar PV increase in electricity mixes, new standards \n\narise, as well as a deeper understanding of the challenges (BRAUN et al., \n\n2012). As an example of a future dominated by renewable energy \n\ngeneration, on a sunny, windy and cool spring weekend day in Germany, \n\nsolar PV and wind power together are able to meet more than 50% of the \n\nnoon peak loads. In those situations, base-load power plants need to be \n\nramped down in order to guarantee power system stability (STETZ et al., \n\n2015). \n\nAlthough perceived as a negative contributor to the grid in terms \n\nof keeping its stability, ongoing research efforts highlight that \n\nphotovoltaics actually have shown to have a positive contribution to grid \n\nfeeders (R\u00dcTHER et al., 2008).  \n\n2.1.4 Variability aspect of the PV technology \n\nA further, and perhaps more intuitive challenge to photovoltaics \n\nintegration, is the inconstant characteristic of the solar PV output. Short-\n\nterm variability (caused by cloud motion) is the most notable contributor \n\n(see Figure 26 as an example of intra-day irradiance variability in \n\nSingapore).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26: Measured clear sky irradiance day in Singapore (in red) and a \n\nday with broken cloud conditions (in blue) (SERIS, 2011). \n\nSeasonal variability can be relatively well predicted, especially \n\nwith the usage of typical meteorological year (TMY) irradiation sources, \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\nwhich usually carry a \u00b110% maximum year-on-year variability, based on \n\na minimum number of years of records of ten, but preferably thirty years \n\n(WILCOX and MARION, 2008). TMYs, however, do not address short-\n\nterm variability (intra-day or a few days ahead). \n\nIn a relatively large area country like Germany, the variability of \n\nthe solar irradiation distribution is smoothened with distance via the so \n\ncalled geographical smoothing. Additionally, even in case of peak \n\nvariations such as the condition illustrated in Figure 23, export of peak \n\nelectricity to nearby countries, e.g. Czech Republic for the case of the \n\nstate of Bavaria in Southern Germany, guarantee system stability.  \n\nHoff and Perez introduced the topic of the smoothing effect PV \n\npower output has over geographical distance (HOFF and PEREZ, 2010). \n\nLave et al. fine-tuned such methods by using spatial-temporal correlations \n\nand tested their method at both a distributed fleet of residential PV \n\nsystems in Japan as well as at a utility-scale PV plant in Nevada, USA \n\n(LAVE et al., 2013). \nTaking the case of Singapore as an opposite example, one would \n\nface a much more challenging environment for operations. Firstly, \n\ngeographical smoothing is limited due to the small country area (roughly \n\n40x20 km of dimensions). Occurrences of low or nearly zero irradiance \n\nlevels in one area of the island, with high levels in the other, are possible \n\n(see Figure 27). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27: Irradiance variability in Singapore with examples of a) an instant \n\nwith half of the island covered by rain (left) and b) high peaks of irradiance \n\nand cloudy conditions (source: SERIS). \n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n72 \n\n2.1.5 PV market development and future outlook \n\nAs it was discussed in section 1.1, the development of solar PV \n\nduring the past one and a half decades has been tremendous, with ~178 \n\nGWp (SPE, 2015) of systems deployed to-date from almost negligible \n\nlevels at the turn of the century. \n\nAlthough markets in Europe will not be as robust as they used to \n\nbe in recent years, the vigorous demand in new solar frontiers around the \n\nworld is likely enough to sustain the overall global growth figures. \n\nMoving forward, major regions for PV development will be located \n\nprimarily in Asia, with a key role expected to be played by China, Japan \n\n(see Japanese town with high penetration of PV in Figure 28) and India, \n\nall targeted to be top-five leaders in annual deployments. The United \n\nStates and Brazil, two continental-area countries, are also poised to \n\nadvance MW scale solar PV deployments in the near to medium future. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28: Japanese town with high penetration of residential solar PV \n\nsystems (UEDA, 2010). \n\nSolarPower Europe predicts that by 2019, the annual size of the \n\nworld solar PV market could be anywhere between nearly 400 and 540 \n\nGWp, see Figure 29 (SPE, 2015).  \n\nAll in all, the steady growth of mature markets and the explosive \n\ndoubling and tripling of capacities at new developing ones put solar \nphotovoltaics in a position to become the renewable energy source of \n\nchoice for the future of humanity. The IEA reports that PV could \n\ncontribute 16% of the entire global electricity needs by 2050 (IEA, \n\n2014b). \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 29: Future scenarios for the total volume of PV systems deployed \n\nworldwide up to 2019 (SPE, 2015). \n\nLooking beyond, in its report on world future energy scenarios, \n\nShell proposed two distinct visions leading to the year 2100 \u2013 one focused \n\non the maintenance of the status quo, with increased expenditure on \ntechnology for exploration of existing and new sources of fossil-fuels; the \n\nother, a future where a greater focus on renewable energy deployment is \n\nat play. In the second vision, it is expected that solar PV will power more \n\nthan one third of the entire humanity\u2019s energy needs by 2100 (SHELL, \n\n2013). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n74 \n\n2.2 SOLAR IRRADIANCE AT THE EARTH\u2019S SURFACE \n\n2.2.1 Overview on solar irradiance \n\nThe solar energy resource availability at the Earth\u2019s surface has a \n\nwide range of applications ranging from meteorology, as the most classic \n\nexample, to engineering, agriculture, medical fields and other areas of \n\nsciences (BADESCU, 2008). For the purpose of photovoltaic \n\napplications, it has had a major role in a region\u2019s solar potential \n\nassessment in order to estimate yield reports on the generation capabilities \n\nof a PV system, likewise for other solar-based technologies (such as \n\nconcentrated solar photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and solar \n\nthermal). However, moving forward, a secondary aspect of solar \n\nirradiance starts to take the forefront of investigations \u2013 the forecasting of \n\nthe solar resource ahead of time for a given location where renewable \n\nenergy technologies, which are dependent on solar power, are located. \n\nAcquiring solar irradiance data has been challenging for research \n\ngroups around the world. In the United States, the ratio of stations \n\ncollecting temperature data to those collecting irradiance measurements \n\nis 100:1. That number becomes even more staggering if the entire world \n\nis taken into account \u2013 500:1 (BADESCU, 2008). For Singapore, as \n\nanother example, two known irradiance stations are part of the long-term \n\ndata acquisition network \u2013 Changi Airport and Paya Lebar Airbase (see \n\nboth circled in red in Figure 30). In contrast, the National Environment \n\nAgency of Singapore (NEA) has officially 63 meteorological stations in \n\nits network (with ambient temperature collection stations, seen as a \n\nbackground map in Figure 30, (NEA, 2013a)), thus the discussed ratio of \n\nambient temperature stations to irradiance stations would be ~30:1 for the \n\ncountry. \n\nThe solar irradiation reaching the top of the atmosphere, referred \n\nto as \u201csolar constant\u201d, has an approximate value of 1,366.1 W/m2 \n\n(GUEYMARD, 2004). However, this is an old and outdated figure and \n\nhas been since then corrected to 1,361 W/m2 based on the Solar Radiation \n\nand Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite (ROTTMAN, 2005). This \n\ntotal accounts for the integration on all possible wavelengths of the \n\nspectrum and is also associated with an air mass value of zero (\u201cAM0\u201d). \n\nAir mass 1 (\u201cAM1\u201d) takes place at zenith, when the sun is at the \nhighest position in the sky for a given location, thus the shortest \n\natmosphere length between the Earth\u2019s surface and space. At that \n\nposition, and taking atmosphere losses into account, such as absorption \n\nand refraction by molecules in the air, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\npresence, bring the irradiance value on the surface of the planet to about \n\n1,000 W/m2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30: 63 weather stations in Singapore, with the two only government \n\nirradiance measuring stations marked in red, adapted from (NEA, 2013a). \n\nThe main components of the solar irradiation can be divided into \n\nglobal horizontal irradiation (GHI), diffuse horizontal irradiation (DHI) \n\nand direct normal irradiation (DNI) as the principal parameters. Figure 31 \n\nillustrates the components and decompositions of the irradiation \n\n(BADESCU, 2008). \n\nThe direct component of the irradiance (DNI, also known as the \n\nsolar beam), forms an angle between a flat surface and the solar zenith \n\nangle (z), complementing this angle would be the solar elevation (h). The \n\nrelationship between the components of the solar irradiance on the surface \n\nof the Earth can be described as per Equation 3. \n\n \n\nGHI = DNI ? cos(z) + DHI = DNI ? sin(h) + DHI   (3) \n \n\nFor the situation of a tilted surface, typical for PV systems, \n\nEquation 3 can be further rewritten into: \n\n \n\nGHI = DNI ? cos(?) + Rd ? DHI + R     (4) \n \n\nwhere ? is the incidence angle to the normal of a tilted surface, Rd is a \n\nreduction of the sky view factor and anisotropic scattering, and R is the \n\nradiation reflected from the ground into the tilted surface, also visualized \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n76 \n\nin Figure 31 (BADESCU, 2008). This factor would be dependent on the \n\nalbedo of the surface. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 31: Solar irradiation components (BADESCU, 2008). \n\nFor solar irradiance modeling in PV applications, only the three \n\ncomponents GHI, DNI and DHI are normally used. Section 2.2.3 \n\naddresses these parameters. \n\nFigure 32 is a representation of the sun path diagrams for three \n\nlocations of the world \u2013 Singapore (~1\u00b0N, left), Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil \n\n(~27\u00b0S, middle) and Freiburg, Germany (~48\u00b0N, right), which describe \n\nthe sun\u2019s path on the sky for a given year (GAISMA, 2013).  These \n\nlocations were chosen here to illustrate such polar charts for a \n\ncombination of case studies, namely an Equatorial location, one in the \n\nSouthern hemisphere, and one in the Northern hemisphere, respectively. \n\nAt the same time, the varying absolute value for the latitude (from \n\nlatitudes nearly zero, to 48, through 27 degrees), allows for visualization \n\nof the variation path of the sun in the sky at three considerably different \nlocations of the world. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nFigure 32: Sun path diagrams for the cities of Singapore, Florian\u00f3polis and \n\nFreiburg (from left to right), adapted from (GAISMA, 2013).  \n\nThe green path in Figure 32 is equivalent to the position of the sun \n\nin the sky on June 20/21 (summer solstice for a location in the Northern \n\nhemisphere such as Germany and Singapore, winter solstice for a location \n\nin the Southern hemisphere, such as shown for Florian\u00f3polis). \n\nConversely, the blue path represents the solstice for the opposite yearly \n\nsituation (i.e. on December 21/22). The gray paths are the equinoxes in \n\nMarch and September, where the sun-hours within a day have the same \n\nduration. Finally, the orange line represents the sun path on the day of the \n\naccess to the website, in this case 14th April (GAISMA, 2013). \n\nThe sun path for a location closer to the Equator is relatively equal \n\nin terms of the sun\u2019s \u201ctraveling path\u201d in the Northern or Southern portions \n\nof the sky, thus the duration of daylight is similar in length and longer \n\nthan at locations away from the Equator. This guarantees, in general, \n\nhigher irradiation records for locations in the tropics. \n\nHaving the sun directly overhead cannot be achieved on a location \n\noutside of the region between the two tropics (~23\u00b0N/S), also possible to \n\nbe visualized in Figure 32 for both Florian\u00f3polis (~27\u00b0S, middle) and \n\nFreiburg (~48\u00b0N, right), as seen by the yellow sun path range not \n\noverlaying the central circle representing a standing person/PV system on \n\nthe polar chart. \n\nFor solar resource maximization, it is common to tilt a PV system \n\nto the latitude of a location and towards the opposite hemisphere where \n\nthe system is installed (DGS, 2008). This is the primary reason for \n\nmodules being tilted (discussed in section 2.2.3). Secondarily, it is also \n\nimportant to tilt modules to guarantee the so called \u201cself-cleaning effect\u201d \n\nfrom the rain onto the front glass surface of the modules to prevent soiling \n\naccumulation (covered in section 2.5.2).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n78 \n\n2.2.2 Measuring solar irradiance \n\nFor measurements of the sun\u2019s irradiation, three types of detectors \n\nare used: (1) thermopile, (2) black-body cavity and (3) solid-state \n\n(semiconductor) sensors (BADESCU, 2008). These devices work via \n\ndifferent physical principles from one another and thus register different \n\nvalues at different accuracies. \n\nThermopiles are devices that convert thermal energy to electrical \n\nenergy, with the generation of a voltage output based on the heat flux \n\nfrom the solar irradiance (for the case of pyranometers). Thermopile-\n\nbased detectors cover the whole shortwave spectrum, however limited to \n\n290-2,800 nm (used in most pyranometers) (BADESCU, 2008).  \n\nSolid-state (semiconductor) sensors react to a certain irradiance \n\nvalue by generating a current, which is proportional to the radiation flux. \n\nAs they are typically made of silicon, which has a narrower spectral \n\nresponse (300-1,200 nm) (KING et al., 2004), these devices do not pick \n\nup the broad range of the sun\u2019s irradiation as a thermopile does, making \n\nthem less accurate measuring devices. \n\nFigure 33 shows three types of irradiance devices installed at the \n\nSERIS meteorological station, all measuring the global horizontal \n\nirradiance \u2013 a class II research-grade pyranometer (thermopile, CMP11 \n\nfrom company Kipp &amp; Zonen, far left), a second type of pyranometer \n\n(also a thermopile, SPN1 from Delta-T, next to it, which also measures \n\ndiffuse horizontal irradiance within the same device via a shading mask) \n\nand a silicon sensor (semiconductor, here from maker Mencke &amp; \n\nTegtmeyer). The comparison output for GHI readings highlights the \n\nspectral response effects, especially when benchmarking the silicon \n\nsensor, which has a narrower spectral response against the other sensors.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 33: Three irradiance devices measuring global horizontal irradiance \n\nlocated at the SERIS meteorological station in Singapore (source: SERIS). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n79 \n\nFigure 34 shows the GHI readings for all the previously mentioned \n\nsensors under a clear sky condition in Singapore in 1-min time steps. The \n\nsilicon sensor, which is further calibrated at the Fraunhofer Institute for \n\nSolar Energy Systems (ISE), measured 3.9% less irradiation than the \n\nCMP11 pyranometer for that day. The SPN1 readings highlight variations \n\nin accuracy even between such devices working under the same physical \n\nprinciple. \n\nThese readings highlight the different spectral response of these \n\ndevices, also a further conclusion from Figure 17 whereby various PV \n\ntechnologies would behave differently accordingly to the spectrum \n\nsignature of the solar irradiation at a particular location. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 34: GHI and DHI readings on a clear sky day in Singapore measured \n\nby several irradiance devices (source: SERIS). \n\nAdditionally, it can be seen that the DHI component for the given \n\ndate accounts for 20% of the GHI total, a situation which is rare for a \n\ntropical location such as Singapore, later discussed in more detail under \n\nsection 2.3.2. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n80 \n\n2.2.3 Irradiance models for PV applications \n\nModels to predict the irradiance on a tilted plane are important in \n\nhelping with the assessment of the performance of PV systems (see 2.5.1). \n\nSome of these models perform more accurately than others. Perez, Liu &amp; \n\nJordan and Klucher are a few of the leading models in this field. \n\nIn the past, many authors presented their models to predict solar \n\nradiation on inclined surfaces from the measured global horizontal \n\nirradiance (GHI) and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) (GUEYMARD, \n\n1987; HAY and DAVIES, 1980; KLUCHER, 1979; LIU and JORDAN, \n\n1961; PEREZ et al., 1990; PEREZ et al., 1987; PEREZ et al., 1986; \n\nTEMPS and COULSON, 1977). The models usually differ in the way the \n\ndiffuse radiation is calculated. The first generation model proposed the \n\nconversion of the global horizontal to the tilted irradiation by assuming \n\nthat the total sky diffuse irradiation content is isotropically distributed \n\n(LIU and JORDAN, 1961). However, this assumption is not strictly true. \n\nNewer models treat the diffuse radiation component as anisotropically \n\ndistributed, where the irradiance is treated as the sum of circumsolar and \n\nbackground sky diffuse components (GUEYMARD, 1987; HAY and \n\nDAVIES, 1980; KLUCHER, 1979; PEREZ et al., 1990; PEREZ et al., \n\n1987; PEREZ et al., 1986; TEMPS and COULSON, 1977). \nFigure 35 shows one of the findings of Khoo, Nobre et al. where \n\nthe application of these irradiance models in Singapore was conducted. It \n\nillustrates a polar contour plot of annual tilted irradiance for various \n\norientations and tilt angles in the country. It can be seen that a surface \n\noriented towards East with tilt angle of ~10\u00b0 will yield maximum annual \n\nirradiation (equal to 1,535 kWh/m2) (KHOO, NOBRE, et al., 2014). This \n\ncould be explained from the fact that Singapore is usually sunnier in the \n\nmorning part than in the afternoon as indicated and also due to late \n\nafternoon rain showers, typical of a tropical location. \n\nSecondly, a publication by Yang, Dong et al. addressed \n\ntransposition and decomposition models via a reverse process of \n\nmodeling irradiance at tilted surfaces by utilizing data from tilted silicon \n\nsensors themselves deployed in the field at PV system sites, with the aim \n\nof finding GHI and then validate the conversion from GHI readings \n\nrecorded by another irradiance instrument on site (YANG, DONG, et al., \n2013). The work demonstrated low errors in the conversion between tilted \n\nglobal irradiation in the plane of the array of a PV system back into GHI \n\nvalues. Such finding allows that irradiance devices deployed at PV \n\nsystems at a certain location be converted into GHI values and contribute \n\nto solar resource mapping for a region and even forecasting efforts. \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\nFigure 35: Extrapolation of empirical data for the SERIS meteorological \n\nstation showing highest point of irradiation capture for ~10\u00b0 of tilt, East \n\noriented (KHOO, NOBRE, et al., 2014). \n\nA further contribution addressed improvements of the Perez model \n\nfor the target location of Singapore by making adjustments to the model \n\nvia readings from available flat and tilted irradiance devices (YANG, D., \n\nYE, Z., et al., 2014). Notwithstanding the mentioned publications, the \nPerez model still provides sufficiently low errors, also for a tropical \n\nlocation in Singapore, thus being commonly used for simulations for \n\nprojects in the Southeast Asia region and for modeling within this thesis. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n82 \n\n2.2.4 Irradiation data sources and considerations \n\nIn order to work with irradiance models for a certain region of the \n\nworld for any particular goal \u2013 but especially for renewable energy (e.g. \n\nresource assessment for photovoltaics applications) \u2013 one usually sets out \n\nto find existing historical data for the site of interest. That is often not easy \n\nas the availability of ground irradiance data is poorly linked with the \n\navailability of meteorological stations (as presented in 2.2.1).  \n\nA solution around that would be satellite data. However, data from \n\nsuch imagery inherently carry complications, such as accuracy \n\ncompromises between temporal and spatial synchronization to Earth\u2019s \n\nground measurements for later validation. Moreover, some sources have \n\nbeen known to overestimate values due to difficulty in accounting for \n\nterrain and other geological formations. NASA satellite-derived data \n\n(NASA, 2013) is a good example of such over- and sometimes \n\nunderestimation. As a further example, the Brazilian Institute for Space \n\nResearch (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais \u2013 INPE) in its atlas \n\nfor solar irradiance resource in Brazil (PEREIRA, E.B. et al., 2006) has \nreported overestimation of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) values from \n\nsatellite models versus ground measurements. \n\nA typical meteorological year (TMY) is an average of at least 10 \n\nyears of meteorological data from a certain location of the world. The \n\ndifference between TMYs and the actual present year under evaluation \n\ncould fluctuate, according to normal year-on-year variations, \u00b110% \n\n(WILCOX and MARION, 2008). Ranges venturing outside of this \n\nthreshold are considered rare and are normally associated with extreme \n\nweather phenomena (e.g. during an El Ni\u00f1o year). \n\nWhen using TMY data from a country or region, a user has to take \n\ninto consideration one important aspect: the data might have been \n\nrecorded from a period of time long ago, from e.g. 1960-1980. In their \n\nwork, Robert et al. (ROBERT and KUMMERT, 2012) studied the effect \n\nof using older TMY data for designing net-zero energy buildings of today. \n\nIt was investigated in the publication that global warming considerations \n\nand weather change should be taken into account when performing \n\nsimulations with older irradiation data, so that results do not deviate from \n\nwhat the weather will be like 20-30 years from now. \n\n Another irradiation database source commonly used in PV \n\napplications is from the software Meteonorm, from company Meteotest, \n\nwith over 8,000 weather stations worldwide. The database is made \n\navailable in the commonly-used, commercial-based PV system \n\nsimulation software PVSYST (METEOTEST, 2015). \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\n2.3 CHARACTERIZING TROPICAL CLIMATE \n\n2.3.1 Preliminary remarks \n\nWhen dealing with solar irradiance forecasting and, at the same \n\ntime, with the performance of photovoltaic systems based on a given solar \n\nenergy resource, one must understand the weather characteristics of the \n\nlocation under investigation. \n\nFor Singapore, the country covered in this thesis, high average \n\ndaily ambient temperatures and relative humidity are found year round. \n\nLocated at 1 degree North of the Equator, and having a climate classified \n\nexclusively as tropical (FONG, 2012), Singapore has little or \n\nunnoticeable seasons, except for a clear differentiation between rainy and \n\ndry seasons, characterized by the presence of monsoons.  \n\nFor a PV system, the local weather conditions can be translated \n\ninto what circumstances an installation experiences on a daily basis. As \n\nan example, Figure 36 shows module temperatures in Germany and in \n\nSingapore, highlighting the warmer condition the tropical location system \n\nexperiences in relation to the temperate location. At 1,000 W/m2, a PV \n\npanel in Singapore is ~10\u00b0 C hotter than in Germany. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 36: Module temperature increase versus irradiance on module plane \n\nas registered in Singapore and Germany (NOBRE et al., 2015 (under \n\npreparation)). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n84 \n\n2.3.2 Singapore climate \n\nStorms are common in tropical regions. For the case of Singapore, \n\nfast approaching rain clouds from Malaysia (from the North) and from \n\nIndonesia (from the East, West and South) can change weather conditions \n\nand irradiance levels quite rapidly. As an example, and as previously \n\nshown in Figure 11, a \u201cSumatra squall\u201d, a commonly known weather \n\nphenomenon in the region, is characterized by a fast-moving and sudden \n\nrain-storm front originating from Indonesia, however, predominantly \n\nfrom the West (FONG, 2012). \n\nThere are two monsoon seasons in Singapore \u2013 a Northeastern, \n\ntaking place between November and March, and a Southwestern, between \n\nApril and June. The rainiest months of the year are usually November and \n\nDecember (FONG, 2012). \n\nThe local solar resource is abundant. A recorded TMY for annual \n\nglobal horizontal irradiance (GHI) and diffuse horizontal irradiance \n\n(DHI) is 1,631 and 926 kWh/m2 respectively for a ground meteorological \n\nstation at Changi Airport (METEONORM, 2013). These annual averages \n\nrepresent a diffuse share of ~57% from the total global irradiance, \n\ncharacterizing common cloudy conditions for Singapore. \n\nSERIS has commissioned in May 2010 a comprehensive \n\nmeteorological station, with some of its sensors seen in Figure 37. The \n\nstation was deployed primarily due to the lack of PV-focused irradiance \n\nmeasurements available in the country. The setup possesses 9 silicon \n\nsensors installed at several tilt angles (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 degrees facing \n\nan arbitrary orientation, followed by 4 fa\u00e7ade silicon sensors tilted at 90 \n\ndegrees, facing North, South, East and West). Additionally, the station \n\nhas two pyranometers for global (GHI) and one for diffuse irradiance \n\n(DHI) as previously shown in Figure 33, among other classical \n\nmeteorological sensors such as air temperature &amp; relative humidity, wind \n\nspeed &amp; direction, and atmospheric pressure. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\nFigure 37: SERIS meteorological station rack, with tilted silicon sensors \n\nranging from 0 to 40 degrees (source: SERIS). \n\nFrom Figure 38, which stems from data records of the SERIS \n\nmeteorological station for year 2011, it can be seen that the little \n\nseasonality in Singapore is demonstrated by a small variation of the \n\nambient temperature profile in the country, with a daily annual average \n\naround 27-29\u00b0C. Dips can be seen between the months of November and \n\nFebruary, which are associated with the Northeastern monsoon period. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 38: Ambient temperatures in Singapore for the year 2011. The daily \n\naverages are plotted in orange (SERIS, 2011). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n86 \n\nThe irradiance profile for the country also shows little seasonal \n\nvariations. The SERIS meteorological station has recorded for 2011 the \n\nfollowing results for global and diffuse irradiance components as shown \n\nin Figure 39. Important to note is the high diffuse content, registered at \n\n55% for the year depicted (METEONORM, 2013). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39: Global (GHI) and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) in \n\nSingapore for the year 2011 (SERIS, 2011). \n\nThe numbers shown in Table 4 highlight the high diffuse \n\nirradiation component in a tropical location, with shares of diffuse over \n\nglobal irradiation (diffuse fraction, kd) of above 50%. The typical \n\nmeteorological year (TMY) averages for Singapore are also shown. It is \n\nextremely rare to have a total clear sky day condition in Singapore. One \n\nof such occurrences was the 5th of August 2011 and the plot of global \n\nhorizontal irradiance (GHI) recorded by the SERIS meteorological station \n\nwas seen in Figure 26. The cloudless day shown as a red line is an \n\nextremely rare condition, taking place once or twice throughout a year. \n\nThe time series in blue, also plotted in the same figure, is more \n\nrepresentative of a typical day in the island, with ups and downs in \n\nirradiance due to high cloud content and motion. \n\nThe clear sky example presented in Figure 26 also brings another \n\npiece of important information about irradiance conditions in the \n\nSingapore environment \u2013 the peak irradiance achieved at an approximate \n\nzenith time of 13:15 pm from that August day shows irradiances around \n\n920-950 W/m2, not reaching the theoretical value of 1,000 W/m2, \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n\ndiscussed in section 2.2.1. That can be explained by the fact that \n\nSingapore has high values of relative humidity (see Figure 40), thus the \n\nwater vapor content in the air presents extra blockage for the light to reach \n\nthe Earth\u2019s surface. Moreover, it could be inferred that the presence of \n\naerosols in Singapore\u2019s air has levels above thresholds which would \n\nnormally be found in non-heavily urbanized locations of the world. \n\nTable 4: Typical meteorological year averages for Singapore and results for \n\n2011 through 2014 for the SERIS meteorological station.

Either one of these two \n\nphenomena could be seen in Figure 26 (as the blue time series), with \n\nreadings going above the theoretical ground maximum baseline. Burger \n\nand R\u00fcther (BURGER and R\u00dcTHER, 2006) reported such occurrences \n\nversus PV system inverter behavior and how it can affect overall system \n\nperformance. Almeida et al. reported an irradiance peak of 1,590 W/m2 \n\nin S\u00e3o Paulo (ALMEIDA et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 41: Examples of cloud-edge and cloud-enhancement effects, as \n\ncaptured by SERIS\u2019 sky cameras and validated by ground-measurement \n\nirradiance spikes (GHI > 1,000 W/m2) on sensors (source: SERIS). \n\nThe statistics of solar irradiance in Singapore for one year (2011) \n\nare plotted in Figure 42. On the left, irradiance occurrences above 950 \n\nW/m2 are equal to 4% of the cases. On the other hand, the right graph \n\nshows the irradiance energy distribution (hence irradiation itself), with \n\ncirca 12% of the energy resource above the 950 W/m2 threshold. \n\nWith Singapore being a small country (~720 km2) and with a \n\nrelatively flat terrain, weather conditions do not vary considerably \n\nthrough its land area. Although some districts like Clementi (at slightly \n\nhigher ground, 50-100 m AMSL) and the Bukit Timah Reserve are rainier \nthan others, the solar irradiance resource is relatively constant, at a typical \n\nmeteorological year average of 1,631 kWh/(m2.yr) (METEONORM, \n\n2013). Thus far, via SERIS\u2019 recordings in several areas of the island \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n\nthrough the past five years (2010-2015), the annual irradiation records \n\nhave not crossed the \u00b110% variation thresholds of the TMY. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 42: Irradiance frequency (left) and energy distribution (right) in \n\nSingapore for 2011 (SERIS, 2011).  \n\nSingapore\u2019s National Environment Agency (NEA) has a weather \n\nradar (Selex Model Meteor 1600S-89 Dual Polarization S-Band radar) \n\nlocated at Changi Airport in the Eastern part of the island. This Doppler \n\nradar captures images as the one seen in Figure 43, but also earlier in \n\nFigure 11. The range of the radar is 70 km.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 43: Singapore weather radar located at Changi Airport (FONG, \n\n2012). \n\nThe solar energy resource in Asia is abundant. Figure 44 shows a \n\nsatellite-derived irradiance map from company GeoModel Solar \n\npresenting excellent resource for upcoming PV growth markets such as \n\nChina, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Philippines (SOLARGIS, 2012). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\nFigure 44: Average annual global horizontal irradiation profile for South \n\nand Southeast Asia (SOLARGIS, 2012). \n\nApart from the presence of rain showers, constant cloud motion \n\nand their lower cloud base height in the tropics make it generally difficult \n\nto predict irradiance conditions for short-term PV applications. An \n\nextreme condition observed frequently during the rainy season is a \n\nprolonged precipitation episode across the island due to its small size. \n\nUnder such condition, PV power output drops virtually everywhere in \n\nSingapore, which would need to be compensated by conventional power \n\ngenerators in a future with a considerable share of solar PV. \n\nBeyond fast-changing irradiance levels due to clouds, specific \n\nweather conditions occur in Singapore, especially entire days of island-\nwide rain showers (\u201cwashouts\u201d) or instances when air pollution from \n\nnearby forest fires (\u201chaze\u201d) cover parts or the total area of the city-state \n\n(see 2.3.3). For washouts, the challenge to grid operators lies on the \n\ndiminishing solar PV power output almost entirely in Singapore in a short \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n\nperiod of time, whereas hazy skies reduce the power output of PV systems \n\nby noticeable levels, as it is addressed in the literature review (in 2.3.3), \n\nlater in a section of the method of this thesis (see 3.4.3), with results on \n\nthe topic shown in 4.2.2. \n\nTable 5 presents weather statistics for 2013 and 2014 as recorded \n\nby SERIS\u2019 meteorological station and by the National Environment \n\nAgency (NEA, for the case of the air pollution readings) (NEA, 2014b). \n\nThe number of days with the occurrence of sudden storms, washouts and \n\nhaze episodes are listed. It can be seen that nearly one third (32%) of the \n\ndays in 2013 had drastic variations of irradiance values from the presence \n\nof sudden storms, with a smaller number taking place in 2014 (27%). \n\nAll in all, more than 40% of the days in 2013 posed some level of \n\nsevere weather event, be it a storm, a washout or a hazy day (with strong \n\nair pollution concentrations).  In comparison, the sunnier year of 2014 had \n\nsevere episodes in about one third of the total number of days of that time \n\nspan. Total annual irradiation for 2013 for an average of nine ground \n\nmeasurement sites spread across the island via calibrated silicon sensors \n\nwas 1,491 kWh/m2, whereas for 2014 for the same stations the value was \n\n1,580 kWh/m2, i.e. ~6% higher than the previous year.  \n\nTable 5: Weather statistics for 2013 and 2014 in Singapore including days \n\nwith sudden storms, total \u201cwashout\u201d conditions and with strong air pollution \n\n(\u201chaze\u201d) (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\nMonth \n\nSudden \n\nstorm days \n\nWashout \n\ndays \nHaze days \n\nAverage \n\ndaily \n\nirradiation \n\n2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 \n\nJan 8 5 3 2 0 0 3.84 3.94 \n\nFeb 8 2 4 0 0 0 3.42 5.25 \n\nMar 13 8 0 1 0 0 4.93 5.04 \n\nApr 8 13 2 1 0 0 4.25 4.51 \n\nMay 9 9 1 2 0 0 3.92 4.21 \n\nJun 8 8 0 0 18 0 4.42 4.23 \n\nJul 9 8 3 2 0 0 3.96 4.04 \n\nAug 10 7 1 3 0 0 4.32 3.89 \n\nSep 6 4 5 0 0 4 3.95 4.92 \n\nOct 13 10 0 1 0 6 4.67 4.55 \n\nNov 14 15 2 1 0 1 3.85 3.96 \n\nDec 9 9 3 3 0 0 3.44 3.45 \n\nTotal 115 98 24 16 18 11 1,491 1,580 \n\n%Year 32% 27% 7% 4% 5% 3% n/a n/a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n92 \n\nFigure 45 shows a sequence of sky images encompassing the \n\nperiod when a sudden storm approached a ground measurement station. \n\nEvery image interval is spaced 5-min apart. It can be observed in the \n\nsequence that in a matter of circa 30 minutes, the sky conditions went \n\nfrom relatively clear (irradiance ~800 W/m2) to a total \u201cwashout\u201d \n\ncondition, with irradiance nearly zero. The irradiance profile for the day \n\nis shown on the top left of the image, with a red square delineating the \n\nperiod which the images belong to. \n\nIn Figure 46, a typical irradiance day in Singapore is illustrated, \n\nwhere variable cloud cover conditions are present. The interval between \n\nsky images is also 5-min as per Figure 45. It can be observed that virtually \n\nhalf of the images have the sun covered by a broken cloud, which equate \n\nto an irradiance level \u2013 as per top left of the image and at that time of the \n\nday \u2013 of ~400 W/m2, whereas the other half of the images show nearly \n\nthe entire circumference of the sun clear from clouds, with equivalent \n\nirradiances of ~1,000 W/m2. \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\nFigure 45: Sequence of sky images during a sudden approaching storm in \n\nSingapore, 14:00-15:20, in 5-min intervals (source: SERIS). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\nFigure 46: Sequence of sky images during a typical irradiance day in \n\nSingapore, 12:00-13:20, in 5-min intervals (source: SERIS). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\nWhen severe weather events happen as previously discussed for \n\nSingapore, they present challenges in predicting solar irradiance but also \n\nopportunities for innovative ways of improving these forecasts. Figure 47 \n\n(top) shows the observed global horizontal irradiance (green continuous \n\nline) in 15-min intervals at a central meteorological station in Singapore \n\non a day when a sudden storm hit the island (21st Apr 2013). Such a day \n\nis similar in weather as shown in Figure 45. The 15-min ahead Auto-\n\nRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Persistence \n\nirradiance forecasts are shown (red-dashed and blue-dotted lines \n\nrespectively). The resulting error spikes between the forecasts and the \n\nmeasured values of irradiance can be seen and are also quantified in \n\nFigure 47 (bottom). Such higher uncertainties occurred due to sudden \n\ndrop in irradiance caused by the arrival of dark rainy clouds. Since both \n\nARIMA and Persistence forecasts are dependent on past information for \n\nthe calculation of the step-ahead irradiance, the error in the prediction is \n\nunavoidable. Such peaks in the forecast error time series present \n\nopportunities for enhancement of short-term irradiance forecasts. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 47: Top \u2013 Measured and forecast values for global horizontal \n\nirradiance (GHI) at a central meteorological site in Singapore in a day with \n\na sudden storm, and associated errors (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n96 \n\n2.3.3 Air quality issues in Southeast Asia \n\nAir pollution caused mainly by forest fires for agricultural \n\npurposes (anthropogenic-induced haze) in Southeast Asia has become a \n\nproblem in recent decades (BRAUER and HISHAM-HASHIM, 1998; \n\nFIELD et al., 2009; NICHOL, 1998; QUAH, 2002). The clearing of forest \n\nvegetation and land for farming purposes has sparked continuous political \n\ndebate among nations as the resulting smog covers skies above vast land \n\nareas (HUSSAIN, 2013; ZENGKUN, 2013a). Fires often originate from \n\nwithin Indonesian borders, with the wind transporting smoke clouds to \n\nneighboring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia (MIETTINEN and \n\nLIEW, 2009; VELASCO and ROTH, 2012). In Singapore, located 150-\n\n300 km East of most forest/land fire \u201chot spots\u201d in Sumatra, Indonesia, a \n\nso-called \u201chaze season\u201d is an annual event, causing reduced air quality  \n\nwhich, in turn, trigger population and government outcry (TEO, 2013; \n\nZENGKUN, 2013b). Depending on the prevailing wind direction, some \n\nof the fires might also originate from Borneo, ~600 km East of Singapore \n\n(VELASCO and ROTH, 2012). \n\nMost haze periods take place between the months of August and \n\nOctober, which coincides with the dry monsoon season (Southwest \n\nmonsoon) for the region (NEA, 2014a). Haze events are further \n\naccentuated through the absence of rain showers, as air pollution fumes \n\ntake longer to dissipate. Figure 48 shows two images of the Marina Bay \n\narea in downtown Singapore under moderate and unhealthy air pollution \n\nlevels during the haze crisis of June 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 48: Images of the Marina Bay area in downtown Singapore on (a) a \n\nday with air quality in the moderate range and (b) on a day with values in \n\nthe very unhealthy range. Photo courtesy of Monika Bieri-Gmuer. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\nThe National Environment Agency of Singapore (NEA) created \n\nthe Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) in 1997, which aims at informing \n\nstakeholders and the general public on daily air quality levels in the \n\ncountry (VELASCO and ROTH, 2012). The PSI measures concentrations \n\nof particulate matter of 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5), among other \n\npollutants (NEA, 2014b). NEA used concentration of particulate matter \n\nof 10 microns in size (PM10) up to March 2014 as a primary indicator of \n\nthe air pollution levels, with the PM2.5 readings being incorporated into \n\nthe scale from April 2014 onwards. A PSI under 50 receives a qualitative \n\nrating of \u201cgood\u201d, with other PSI ranges categorized as \u201cmoderate\u201d (51-\n\n100), \u201cunhealthy\u201d (101-200), \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d (201-300) and \n\n\u201chazardous\u201d (> 300). NEA monitors PSI at 5 major areas of the island \n\n(North, South, East, West, and central) at 1-hour intervals, generating 3-\n\nhour and 24-hour pollutant concentration reports. Before the haze crisis \n\nof June 2013, PSI readings were taken in 3-hour intervals. As of early \n\n2015, the most recent major haze event took place in June 2013, with the \n\n24-hour average PSI reaching a peak of 246, and the 1-hour reading \n\nreaching an all-time high of 401 a few days later (NEA, 2013b). Prior to \n\nJune 2013, readings were only taken every 3 hours. Figure 49 shows the \n\nhistorical frequencies for 24-hour PSI concentrations for the time period \n\nof 2009 to 2013, as recorded by the local environment agency. An average \n\nof 7% of all days in the 5-year span fell outside of the \u201cgood\u201d range of the \n\nscale. The 24-hour average of PSI values for May through July 2013 \n\n(bottom) shows an 18-day strong haze period in which the pollutant index \n\ncrossed into the \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d range. \n\nIt is only natural that the first major concern when haze occurs is \n\nlinked to medical implications in terms of the detrimental influence air \n\npollution has on the health of children, elderly and individuals with heart \n\nor respiratory illnesses (FRANKENBERG et al., 2005; JAMROZIK and \n\nMUSK, 2011; SASTRY, 2002). Haze could also affect other aspects of \n\nlife, such as the ecosystem and climate change, but those effects are still \n\nbeing investigated (VELASCO and ROTH, 2012).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n98 \n\n \n\nFigure 49: Five categories of the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) plotted for \n\ntheir annual frequencies and for a period of three months (NOBRE et al., \n\n2015 (accepted)). \n\nSingapore\u2019s air quality levels also get affected by its industrial \n\nsector, which includes refineries, chemical and electronic industries, and \n\npower plants for electricity generation (which however burn natural gas \n\nand hence are less polluting than e.g. coal- or oil-fired power plants)  \n\n(VELASCO and ROTH, 2012).  Furthermore, the country has one of the \n\nbusiest ports and airports in the world, a population of 5.4 million in a \n\nsmall area and nearly one million vehicles on the streets (LTA, 2014). All \n\nthese components present additional sources of pollutant gases and \n\naerosols that contribute to day to day poor air quality levels in the country. \n\nA baseline PSI of 30 to 50 points is therefore seen on a regular basis (see \n\nFigure 49 bottom for PSI records prior to the haze crisis of June 2013). \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n\nIn a trivial sense, the haze blocks the irradiation from reaching the \n\nEarth\u2019s surface. Although investigations on the haze influence on \n\nirradiation date back decades, they were either linked to examples in \n\nmilitary applications (CHEN, 1975), or to medical studies (health-related \n\nhazards), such as UV exposure (ESTUPI\u00d1\u00c1N et al., 1996). In Brazil, the \n\npresence of aerosols from forest fires was assessed to explain deviations \n\nin satellite data which are concurrently used for the assessment of \n\nirradiances levels in parts of the country (PEREIRA et al., 2000). In \nregards to the topic of air pollution with a direct link to renewable energy \n\nusage, available works are limited, without straight results to haze and \n\nreal-world PV system performance in the field. Calinoiu et al. reported a \n\nloss of irradiation of 20% at the surface during periods of strong air \n\npollution in Romania with the goal of assessing the impact of such \n\noccurrences on future solar PV deployment (CALINOIU et al., 2013). \nFaine et al. investigated spectral, air mass and also aerosol optical depth \n\n(turbidity) changes in their pioneer work in the 90s. Simulations were \n\nused to obtain results of the effects of the parameters to various high and \n\nlow band gap PV devices (FAINE et al., 1991). More recently, Fern\u00e1ndez \n\net al. evaluated change in spectra at five different locations in the world \n\n(measured by local meteorological stations). The authors evaluated the \n\nconsequences of the changed spectra to their four different simulated high \n\nconcentrator photovoltaic modules (FERN\u00c1NDEZ et al., 2014). \n\nThe spectrum shift caused by the haze can be observed to affect \n\nPV system performance. Liu et al. presented measured daily performance \n\nratios of 10 PV systems in Singapore for the period of May 2013 to July \n\n2013 (see Figure 50). Five amorphous silicon thin-film systems (top five \n\ncurves) and five multicrystalline silicon wafer-based systems (bottom \n\nfive curves) are shown. The lines represent the 3-day moving averages as \n\na guide to the eyes, with the haze period marked by vertical dashed lines \n\n(LIU et al., 2014b). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n100 \n\n \n\nFigure 50: Measured daily performance ratios of 10 PV systems of two main \n\ntechnologies in Singapore for the period of May to July 2013 (LIU et al., \n\n2014b). \n\nThe influence of haze, which has been occurring on an annual basis \n\nlately in Singapore, is therefore a phenomenon that needs to be \n\nunderstood and quantified for a realistic assessment of the performance \n\nand yield of future PV installations. Especially during the recent haze \n\nevent of June 2013, PV system owners and investors have sought for \n\nanswers on the amount of energy loss which would eventually have \n\naffected their assets\u2019 returns on investment. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n\n2.3.4 Other tropical climates around the globe \n\nA list of countries across the world which have tropical weather \n\nwithin their territories, as classified by the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate \n\nclassification (PEEL et al., 2007), can be seen in Table 6. \n\nTable 6: List of countries with tropical climate conditions, adapted from \n\n(PEEL et al., 2007). \n\nCountry Continent Population \n[million \n\ninhabitants] \n\nLatitude \n\nRange \n\nTime \n\nZone \n[UTC] \n\nIndia Asia ~1,210 8-35\u00b0N +5.5 \n\nIndonesia Asia ~256 5\u00b0N-10\u00b0S +7/9 \n\nBrazil South America ~200 4\u00b0N to 33\u00b0S -2/5 \n\nNigeria Africa ~175 4-14\u00b0N +1 \n\nPhilippines Asia ~101 6-19\u00b0N +8 \n\nVietnam Asia ~91 8-23\u00b0N +7 \n\nThailand Asia ~67 6-20\u00b0N +7 \n\nMalaysia Asia ~31 1-7\u00b0N +8 \n\nPeru South America ~31 1-18\u00b0S -5 \n\nChile South America ~18 17-55\u00b0S -3/5 \n\nSingapore Asia ~6 ~1\u00b0N +8 \n\nTOTAL  ~2,187   \n\n \n\nThe selection of the ten countries as per Table 6 (plus Singapore \n\nthe location of study within this thesis) is aimed at highlighting countries \n\nwith substantial presence of tropical climate. They account to a \n\nconsiderable amount of inhabitants of the planet. \n\nAs these countries are mostly developing nations, it is expected \n\nthat they are bound to have strong and growing energy needs for years \n\nand decades to come. \n\nSomewhat exploring on the weather patterns in one of these \n\nexample nations, Brazil and its enormous land area (8.5 million km2, \n\nbeing the fifth biggest country in the world), possesses a variety of climate \n\nconditions throughout its territory, but in its great majority tropical and \n\nsubtropical weather. For Brazil, and as previously mentioned in 2.2.4, \n\nINPE has produced a solar resource atlas based on satellite measurements \nand solar radiative models (PEREIRA, E.B. et al., 2006). Figure 51 shows \n\ntwo of such images produced by the publication. \n\nThe North part of the country at the Amazon basin area is the \n\nrainiest region of Brazil, also the cloudiest (PEREIRA, E. B. et al., 2006). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n102 \n\nThat makes the Northern territory of the country and these locations near \n\nthe Equator cloud-rich, which can be seen from Figure 51, right. The city \n\nof Bel\u00e9m (~1\u00b0S) has a similar climate to the one found in Singapore.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 51: Annual global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and diffuse horizontal \n\nirradiance (DHI) in the Brazilian territory (PEREIRA, E. B. et al., 2006). \n\nThe irradiation in Brazil is strongest in the region covering the \n\nNortheastern territory all the way to the Southeastern region. The highest \n\nirradiance months are during spring (Sep-Oct) with the lowest in winter \n\n(Jun-Jul). The annual average for GHI (Figure 51, left) highlights these \n\nregions in the lightest shade of orange. Total annual irradiance levels \n\nrange from a lowest of 1,550 kWh/m2, in the Southern part of Brazil at \n\nthe North portion of the state of Santa Catarina, to 2,350 kWh/m2, in the \n\nbest solar-resource area, in the Northern areas of the state of Bahia \n\n(PEREIRA, E. B. et al., 2006). To exemplify the solar potential of the \n\ncountry, the least sunny capital in Brazil receives ~40% more solar \n\nirradiation than the sunniest region in Germany (R\u00dcTHER, 2004). \n\nTable 7 shows key meteorological information for photovoltaic \n\npurposes for nine capitals in Brazil, organized from latitudes closest to \n\nthe Equator to furthest from it (NASA, 2013). From a pool of the \n\nmentioned cities, annual average of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) is \n\n1,790 kWh/m2, once again emphasizing the excellent solar resource found \n\nin the South American country. \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n\nTable 7: Key meteorological parameters for PV applications for some \n\ncapitals in Brazil (NASA, 2013). \n\nCity \n\nState \n\nBel\u00e9m \n\nPA \n\nS\u00e3o Lu\u00eds \n\nMA \n\nSalvador \n\nBA \n\nLatitude [\u00b0] 1\u00b0S 3\u00b0S 13\u00b0S \n\nGHI [kWh/m2] 1,956 2,180 1,977 \n\nAvg. kd [%] 53.9% 60.3% 55.5% \n\nAvg.

Inman et al. \n\nsummarized several methods and examples for solar irradiance \n\nforecasting (INMAN et al., 2013). In the comprehensive review, cited \npublications were shown which tackled different forecast horizons and \n\ninvestigation locations around the world. Among ~100 cited works of \n\nforecasting techniques applied for solar PV, the great majority of \n\npublications were for studies in the United States, Europe and Japan, \n\nwhich highlights that research efforts on this topic were, and still are, \n\nprimarily focused where solar PV markets are prolific. As previously \n\naddressed, those locations also happen to be primarily dominated by more \n\ntemperate climates. \n\nResearch on solar irradiance forecasting has focused mostly on 1-\n\nhour to 3-hour intervals (intra-day forecasts) and day-ahead intervals \n\n(MARQUEZ and COIMBRA, 2011; MARQUEZ et al., 2013; PEDRO \n\nand COIMBRA, 2012). \n\nVarious forecasting techniques were developed and demonstrated \n\nat many locations in the world, as mentioned, predominantly where PV \n\ndeployment has flourished, using several methods such as numerical \n\nweather prediction models (DIAGNE et al., 2014; LARA-FANEGO et \n\nal., 2012; LORENZ et al., 2012; MATHIESEN and KLEISSL, 2011; \n\nPEREZ et al., 2013), stochastic methods, e.g. auto-regressive integrative \nmoving average (ARIMA) (MASA-BOTE and CAAMA\u00d1O-MART\u00cdN, \n\n2010; YANG, SHARMA, et al., 2015), artificial intelligence, e.g. \nartificial neural networks (ANN) (CAO, J. C. and CAO, S. H., 2006; \n\nFONSECA JUNIOR et al., 2014; MARQUEZ and COIMBRA, 2011; \n\nMELLIT and KALOGIROU, 2008; MELLIT and PAVAN, 2010), \n\nsky/satellite imagery analysis (MARQUEZ and COIMBRA, 2013; \n\nYANG, H. et al., 2014) and even a combination of techniques (DA \n\nSILVA FONSECA et al., 2012; DONG et al., 2014; MARQUEZ et al., \n2013; NONNENMACHER and COIMBRA, 2014). Previous works on \n\nsolar forecasting in Singapore have used some of these approaches \n(DONG et al., 2014; 2013; YANG, D., DONG, Z., et al., 2014; YANG \n\net al., 2012; YANG, WALSH, et al., 2013). \n\nFigure 52 shows range of appropriate techniques utilized in solar \n\nirradiance forecasting.  \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n\n \n\nFigure 52: Time horizon versus spatial resolution for solar irradiance \n\nforecasting and suitable techniques for application. Source: (INMAN et al., \n\n2013) \n\nThe leading groups in the world for solar irradiance forecasting are \n\nrelatively new, with most of the research having taken place in the 2010 \n\nto 2015 span, as some of the literature presented attest. Some of these \n\nnames and associated publications can be mentioned below: \n\n \n\n- Energy Meteorology Unit of the University of Oldenburg, \nGermany: (LORENZ et al., 2012; LORENZ et al., 2011); \n\n \n\n- University at Albany, United States and National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, Colorado: (PEREZ et al., \n\n2010; PEREZ et al., 2007); \n \n\n- University of California San Diego (UCSD), United States of \nAmerica, with the Coimbra Forecasting Group: (CHU et al., \n\n2013; INMAN et al., 2013; MARQUEZ and COIMBRA, 2011; \n\n2013; 2012; MARQUEZ et al., 2013; NONNENMACHER and \nCOIMBRA, 2014; PEDRO and COIMBRA, 2012; ZAGOURAS \n\net al., 2015); \n\n \n\n- University of California San Diego (UCSD), United States of \nAmerica, with the Kleissl Group: (CHOW et al., 2015; CHOW \net al., 2011; GOHARI et al., 2014; KLEISSL, 2013; \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n106 \n\nLIPPERHEIDE et al., 2015; MATHIESEN et al., 2013; \n\nMATHIESEN and KLEISSL, 2011; URQUHART et al., 2015);  \n\n \n\n- Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE): (LIMA et al., \n2014; MARTINS et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\nSome isolated work has taken place in China (CAO, J.C. and CAO, \n\nS.H., 2006; CHEN et al., 2011), Japan (DA SILVA FONSECA et al., \n2012; FONSECA JUNIOR et al., 2014; FONSECA_JR. et al., 2013), \n\nItaly (MELLIT and PAVAN, 2010), Saudi Arabia (EISSA et al., 2013), \n\nand a few other locations. \n\nOther factors could play a role in irradiance forecasting beyond \n\ncloud coverage, such as aerosol concentration (GUEYMARD, 2012). \n\nComments on aerosol influence were made in subsection 2.3.3 and are \n\nlater addressed in other areas of this thesis. \n\nSection 2.4 serves as identification of relevant literature in the solar \n\nirradiance forecasting area of photovoltaics. It helps set the tone for the \n\nstate-of-the-art in this specific field. \n\n2.4.2 Stochastic methods \n\nPedro and Coimbra investigated a mix of results for the Persistence \n\nmethod (assuming the next time horizon to be the same condition as the \n\nprevious one), nearest neighbor (estimation of a station reading based on \n\nthe closest site from it) and ARIMA (autoregressive integrating moving \n\naverage) for a site in California (PEDRO and COIMBRA, 2012). \n\nYang et al. (YANG et al., 2012) have tested an ARIMA method \n\nusing cloud cover index with some success for Singapore.  \n\nOther research covering stochastic methods include (MARQUEZ \n\nand COIMBRA, 2011; MASA-BOTE and CAAMA\u00d1O-MART\u00cdN, 2010; \n\nYANG, SHARMA, et al., 2015). It is common that a combination of \n\ntechniques is involved, in order to also explore lower errors. In most of \n\nthe cases, a stochastic element is present, as part of the works of \n\n(ARYAPUTERA et al., 2015; CHU, LI, et al., 2015; CHU et al., 2013; \n\nCHU, URQUHART, et al., 2015; DONG et al., 2014; LIPPERHEIDE et \nal., 2015; MARQUEZ et al., 2013; NONNENMACHER and COIMBRA, \n\n2014).  \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n\n2.4.3 Satellite and numeric weather prediction \n\nWhen using satellite data, one of the challenges is in the temporal \n\nand spatial synchronization between the satellite image itself and ground \n\nmeasurement recorded (JOURN\u00c9E et al., 2011). A satellite image taken \non top of Southeast Asia is seen on Figure 53, with Singapore highlighted. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 53: Southeast Asia satellite image with Singapore highlighted inside \n\nthe circle (NEA, 2010). \n\nWork has advanced in the analysis of pre-processed regional NWP \n\nforecasts, such as presented by Lorenz (LORENZ et al., 2012; LORENZ \n\net al., 2011). Mathiesen and Kleissl also worked with a NWP for the \nforecasting trials in the United States (MATHIESEN and KLEISSL, \n\n2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n108 \n\nThe WRF numerical model (Weather Research and Forecasting \n\nModel) has been developed as a co-operation among several research \n\ninstitutes in the world. It has first been used for classical numerical \n\nweather predictions, later being adapted for wind applications in \n\nrenewable energy. Recently, WRF has gained momentum for day-ahead \n\nsolar irradiance forecasting efforts. \n\nLima et al. used the WRF model together with other statistical \n\nmethods for forecasts for the Northeastern region of Brazil. Since the \n\nclimate varies considerably in the region, a cluster analysis was used. The \n\nforecast horizon was set for one day-ahead (LIMA et al., 2014). \n\nAs the thesis focuses on short-term solar irradiance forecasting, the \n\nutilization of numerical methods such as WRF, or of satellite images, are \n\nnot explored. Figure 53 showing a satellite image from Southeast Asia, \n\nwith Singapore marked within the red circle, with the totality of the island \n\nbeing only made of a couple of pixels in the image, highlight the vast \n\nextension involved in modeling the weather, thus making it difficult to \n\nutilize short-term resources with these products. \n\n2.4.4 Artificial intelligence methods \n\nAn artificial neural network (ANN), with an schematic shown in \n\nFigure 54, is a massive parallel processor, made up of simple processing \n\nunits (neurons), which have the ability of storing knowledge (synaptic \n\nweights) and making it available for posterior use (HAYKIN, 1999). The \n\nresemblance of ANN with the brain lies on the fact that it has the ability \n\nto learn from experience from the environment through a learning process \n\nand store knowledge. \n\nMajor benefits of neural networks can be linked to their ability to \n\noperate nonlinearly, which makes them suitable for handling phenomena \n\nwith complex physical models, which, in most cases, are difficult or \n\nimpractical to solve via linear functions. The adaptive nature of ANNs is \n\nan added advantage as their synaptic weights can vary with time. \n\nThe connections between neurons are given in the form of weights \n\n(the influence of one neuron versus the next), through synapses or \n\nconnecting links. A linear combiner (summing junction in Figure 54) \n\nmerges the respective synapses between neurons. \n\nThe bias acts in the process by creating an effect of increasing or \nlowering the net input into an activation function, depending on whether \n\nit is a positive or negative bias, respectively. \n\nUCSD has published works with several configurations of neural \n\nnetworks for applications based on data from California (MARQUEZ and \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n\nCOIMBRA, 2011), (PEDRO and COIMBRA, 2012) and (MARQUEZ et \n\nal., 2013). Mellit has investigated a neural network in Italy focused on \n\ndaily irradiance and ambient temperature from the previous day as input \n\nparameters (MELLIT and PAVAN, 2010). The goal was to test ANNs for \n\none-day-ahead forecasts. The method involved testing different \n\nconfigurations of hidden neurons and layers almost at random. After a \n\nfew trials, the authors opted for the most successful method (i.e. the one \n\nwith the smallest RMSE) and proceeded from there into the results \n\nvalidation for a PV system in Italy using a simplistic PV performance \n\nmodel. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 54: Artificial neural network schematic based on a nonlinear model \n\nof a neuron (HAYKIN, 1999). \n\nIn Brazil, Martins et al. (MARTINS et al., 2012) have combined \ninput parameters from a mesoscale model (Eta model, running at INPE) \n\nfor training of an ANN, with training and validation taking place based \n\non two ground-measurement solar radiation stations. RMSE \n\nimprovement in the forecasts was in the order of 30%. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n110 \n\n2.4.5 Sky imagery utilization \n\nSky imagers (more recently being replaced by cheaper CCD \n\ncameras with fish-eye lenses pointing at the sky) can capture stills such \n\nas the ones shown in Figure 55. \n\nCloud vectors and classification can be assessed with post-\n\nprocessing software. In Brazil, Mantelli Neto has written a thesis on \n\nevaluation of sky images for cloud assessment in the Brazilian territory \n\n(NETO, 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 55: Sky images from cameras with fish-eye lenses (source: UCSD). \n\nComprehensive overviews on sky camera utilization for short-term \n\nforecasting purposes are given by groups in the United States and \n\nAustralia (URQUHART et al., 2015; WEST et al., 2014). \n\nSignificantly fewer publications can be found in the literature on \n\nshort-term forecasting applications (sub-hour level). Marquez and \n\nCoimbra (MARQUEZ and COIMBRA, 2013) used sky images in \n\nMerced, California to create short-term forecasts of direct normal \n\nirradiance of a few minutes up to 15-min. The authors concluded that a 5-\n\nmin forecast horizon presented the most significant accuracy for their \n\ndataset. Yang et al. (YANG, H. et al., 2014) also utilized sky images in \n\nCalifornia to perform short-term forecasts. In winter, with more cloud \n\ncover in the region, the method proved more effective than in summer \nconditions, where persistence forecasts prevail due to the near clear-sky \n\nconditions. Normalized root mean square errors (nRMSE) ranged from \n\n20-27% for 5- and 10-min prediction horizons. \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n\nNguyen and Kleissl explored 2D and 3D methods to determine \n\ncloud base heights (NGUYEN and KLEISSL, 2014), which are features \n\nof interest in assisting short-term solar irradiance forecasting efforts.  \n\nA network of sky cameras has been deployed in Singapore by \n\nSERIS to assist on such forecasting efforts. Figure 56 shows the marked \n\nlocations of these devices in the Singapore map. At the time of the \n\nsubmission of this thesis, thirteen cameras had been deployed. The \n\ninstitute makes live images available via its National Solar Repository of \n\nSingapore (NSR) website (NSR, 2015e).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 56: Deployed network of thirteen sky cameras in Singapore (NSR, \n\n2015e). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n112 \n\n2.4.6 Research on short-term solar irradiance forecasting \n\nResearch on solar irradiance forecasting has focused mostly on 1-\n\nhr, intra-day (a few hours) as well as day-ahead intervals, and \n\npredominantly in countries where PV has reached considerable \n\npenetration levels. The great majority of the forecast horizons have been \n\nfocused at 1-hour to 3-hour intervals (thus in the intra-day range) \n\n(MARQUEZ and COIMBRA, 2011; MARQUEZ et al., 2013; PEDRO \nand COIMBRA, 2012).  \n\nFor short-term applications (minutes to sub-hourly), much less \n\npublications can be found, such as Marquez and Coimbra who used a total \n\nsky imager in California (MARQUEZ and COIMBRA, 2013), Yang et al. \n\nalso utilizing a sky imager in the US state to perform short-term forecasts \n\n(YANG, H. et al., 2014). \n\nYang et al. used a dense monitoring network of irradiance detectors \n\nin Hawaii to correlate lagged time series in the small sample area for very \n\nshort-term irradiance forecasting. Lasso regression is implemented as a \n\nparameter selection method. Results achieved showed a further \n\nimprovement over Persistence and other time series methods (YANG, \n\nYE, et al., 2015). \n\n2.4.7 Solar irradiance forecasting in the tropics \n\nPrevious work on forecasting in Singapore has used primarily \n\nstatistical approaches (DONG et al., 2014; 2013; YANG, D., DONG, Z., \n\net al., 2014; YANG et al., 2012; YANG, WALSH, et al., 2013). Yang et \nal. (YANG et al., 2012) used the cloud cover index as a model input \n\nparameter, achieving normalized root mean square errors of circa 20% for \n\n1-hour prediction intervals. The same authors published a novel method \n\non spatial temporal kriging for interpolating forecast purposes. With this, \n\nthey argue that the area of Singapore and the specific solar PV systems \n\nwithin it, based on their location, could have dedicated forecasting \n\nproducts (YANG, D., DONG, Z., et al., 2014).  \n\nDong et al. (DONG et al., 2013) used an exponential smoothing \n\nstate space  model (commonly abbreviated as ETS) apart from ARIMA. \n\nA forecast interval of 5-min was implemented, achieving normalized root \n\nmean square errors of 17-33%. When comparing the new proposed model \n\nto ARIMA, the authors obtained a few percentage points of improvement, \n\nwith some months with virtual similar forecast accuracies. In a hybrid \n\napproach, using satellite imagery and the ETS model, Dong et al. (DONG \n\net al., 2014) investigated hourly solar irradiance forecasting, with \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n\nnormalized root mean square errors (nRMSE) ranging from 20% to 45%, \n\nwith larger errors occurring during the monsoon season. \n\nSharma et al. (SHARMA et al., 2015 (in press)) executed a wavelet \nneural network (WNN) taking averaged irradiance values of 13 stations \n\ndistributed across Singapore for hourly intervals of prediction. Results for \n\nfour different seasons of the year showed slight forecast skill \n\nimprovement over ARIMA, and also over a simpler artificial neural \n\nnetworks (ANN) method. \n\nAryaputera et al. (ARYAPUTERA et al., 2015) ran the WRF \n\nnumerical model for Singapore, aiming at obtaining day-ahead forecasts \n\nfor the island. RMSEs of ~45% were obtained, with a slight improvement \n\nover the Persistence method for such 24-hour-ahead products. \n\nIn other tropical and subtropical studies, Khatib et al. (KHATIB et \n\nal., 2012) generated a four feedback forward propagation neural network \nusing relative humidity, ambient temperature, global horizontal \n\nirradiation and wind speed with data from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  \n\nIn a subtropical study, Martins et al. (MARTINS et al., 2012) \n\napplied ANNs for two sites in Southern Brazil using the new model to \n\nrefine inherent known biases associated with an existing numerical \n\nweather model. Confidence and reliability were improved by more than \n\n30% for both sites under study.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n114 \n\n2.5 PV SYSTEMS SIMULATION AND PERFORMANCE \n\n2.5.1 Yield and performance ratio of PV systems \n\nSolar photovoltaic panels are rated at the end of a manufacturer\u2019s \n\nproduction line according to the Standard Test Conditions (STC) for PV \n\nmodules, which are characterized as the laboratory indoor setting for flash \n\ntesting set at 1,000 W/m2 irradiance, 25\u00b0C PV cell temperature and \n\nspectral distribution of light equivalent to 1.5 AM (air mass) spectrum \n\n(IEC, 2011).  \n\nUpon commissioning of a PV system, its quality assessment and \n\ncontinuous performance are important gauges to owners and financiers \n\non the return on investment for the particular asset. It is important to \n\nobserve and compare performance ratio (PR), which is based on in-plane \n\nirradiance and total annual yield measured in kWh/kWp per year, versus \n\nbenchmark values for a given place where the asset is located. \n\nPerformance ratio is an internationally-recognized assessment \n\nparameter for the verification of system design and operational quality. \n\nAs per IEC 61724 standards (IEC, 1998), performance ratio is defined as \n\nthe ratio of the final PV system yield (Yf) over the reference yield (Yr): \n\n \n\nPR = \n?f\n\n?r\n      (5) \n\n \n\nThe final PV system yield (Yf) is the net AC energy output (EAC) \n\ndivided by the nameplate DC power (P0) of the installed PV array, i.e.: \n\n \n\nYf =\nEAC\n\nP0\n         (6) \n\n \n\nwith the units of hours or kWh/kWp representing the number of hours that \n\nthe PV array would need to operate at its rated power to provide the same \n\namount of energy on an annual basis.  \n\nThe reference yield (Yr) is the total in-plane irradiance Gmod, \n\ndivided by the photovoltaic reference irradiance, G0 = 1,000 W/m\n2, i.e.: \n\n \n\nYr =\n? Gmod\n\nt\n\nG0\n         (7) \n\n \n\nwhich represents an equivalent number of hours at the reference \n\nirradiance set-point. Thus, PR can be expanded by substituting Yf and Yr \n\ninto PR as: \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n\nPR =\nEAC P0?\n\n? Gmod\nt G0?\n\n=\nG0\n\nP0\n\u00d7\n\n? PAC\nt\n\n? Gmod\nt\n\n      (8) \n\n \n\nwhere PAC is the AC power output of a PV system. It should be noted that \n\nGmod here should be measured by an irradiance measurement device with \n\nthe same orientation and tilt as the PV array such as the one shown in \n\nFigure 57. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 57: Silicon sensor installed in the plane of the photovoltaic array, here \n\n10 degrees (source: SERIS). \n\nWith these boundary conditions for performance ratio assessment, \n\nit could be inferred that PV systems installed at fa\u00e7ades could, for \n\nexample, still have a high PR, although their annual yield would be \n\nconsiderably lower than a rooftop system due to less irradiance reaching \n\nthe module plane on the vertical surface. From a system design \n\nperspective, however, it is sufficient to analyze performance ratio alone \n\nas a parameter to maximize performance at any given site. \n\nThe performance ratio is in general independent of the irradiance \n\nconditions at a given site and is therefore a good indicator of the \n\ncomparison of the performance of PV systems in different locations. PR \n\ncan also be used to measure the behavior of a system over time (JORDAN \nand KURTZ, 2013; RUTHER et al., 2010a), also being regarded as a PV \n\nsystem design quality metric. \n\nThe irradiance sensor for the measurement of performance ratio is \n\nusually a calibrated pyranometer. However, due to high costs of these \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n116 \n\ndevices, it has become increasingly common to measure performance of \n\nPV systems with off-the-shelf, yet properly calibrated silicon sensors. \n\nFigure 58 summarizes the deviation in monthly totals from three \n\nirradiance sensors under monitoring at the SERIS meteorological station. \n\nThe baseline, represented by the black line, is associated with the readings \n\nof a calibrated pyranometer (manufacturer: Kipp &amp; Zonen, type: \n\nCMP11).  \n\nSecondly, the orange circles are the deviation of a second \n\npyranometer (manufacturer: Delta-T, type: SPN1), showing higher \n\nreadings (average +1.4%) versus the baseline. This difference could be \n\nexplained by the different sensor construction, with a dome type which \n\nincludes a shading mask and internal unit algorithm running relationships \n\nbetween seven sets of thermopiles for the acquisition of the DHI reading. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 58: Three sensors measuring global horizontal irradiance under \n\ncomparison. The CMP11 pyranometer acts as a baseline (source: SERIS). \n\nThirdly, a silicon sensor (manufacturer: Mencke &amp; Tegtmeyer, \n\ntype: Si-02-PT100-K, calibrated at Fraunhofer ISE\u2019s CalLab), shown as \n\nblue circles in the figure under discussion, has clear readings below a \n\npyranometer (average -2.6% as recorded at the station for the period \n\ndisplayed). This is the case as the spectral response of silicon is narrower \n\nwhen compared with a pyranometer, as previously mentioned in \n\nsubsection 2.2.2. Nevertheless, a silicon sensor can be calibrated to \n\naccount for this issue. \n\nAs seen in Figure 58 with the lower readings versus a pyranometer, \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n\nthe fact that a silicon sensor behaves like a solar module (flat plate \n\nsemiconductor), reflecting part of the light on its front glass (versus a \n\npyranometer which absorbs most of the spectrum of the light from all \n\nangles through its glass dome, see Figure 33), it can be concluded that the \n\nperformance ratio, when calculated based on readings from a \n\npyranometer, will show lower values than for sites where irradiance \n\nrecordings come from silicon sensors. \n\nReich et al. (REICH et al., 2012) pointed out that there is a strong \ntemperature dependence of the performance ratio since the energy \n\nproduced by a PV system will be affected by module temperature. \n\nTherefore, PV systems in temperate zones will have a higher PR than \n\ncomparable systems (with respect to module technology, inverters and \n\nlevel of ventilation) in tropical regions of the world. Nobre et al. \n\n(NOBRE, YE, et al., 2012) verified performance ratios in tropical \nSingapore with best PRs around 83% which are below those reported by \n\nReich et al. as state-of-the-art systems in Germany (close to and \n\napproaching consistently the 90% mark, see Figure 59). This apparent ~6-\n\n7% gap in performance between tropical- and temperate-zone located PV \n\nsystems has been the topic of study of the author with published and under \n\npreparation works. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 59: Evolution of performance ratio in Germany through the past 2 \n\ndecades (REICH et al., 2012). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n118 \n\nAnother factor which can be observed in Figure 59 is that PV \n\nsystems\u2019 yields and performance ratios have evolved through the past two \n\ndecades. One can clearly see the migration of performance ratios towards \n\nthe upper 70s (of percentage points) and later towards the 80-90% band \n\nas time progressed. These improvements can be traced back to four major \n\nreasons namely: (1) advances in inverter efficiency and reliability, with \n\nunits both reaching specification maximum efficiencies close to and \n\nslightly above 98%, versus low 90s circa 20 years ago. Additionally, \n\ninverters trip less in relation to its electric grid interactions today than \n\nearlier models, increasing overall system uptime; (2) solar module \n\ntolerances, with PV modules being segregated at the factory now with \n\n\u201cplus-tolerances\u201d, meaning if one acquires a 250 Wp module, the actual \n\noutput of the module is 250 W plus a certain value (for example 5 W), \n\nversus 10-20 years ago when product tolerance would have been 250 W \n\nplus, but also minus 5 W; (3) overall improvement of balance of systems \n\ncomponents (BOS) aligned with system integrators\u2019 increased learning \n\ncurves while making use of best practices of PV systems; and (4) \n\nadvanced monitoring systems, many operating in real-time nowadays, \n\nwhich are now able to communicate system issues to owners upon \n\noccurrences, thus minimizing total system downtime. \n\nApart from the IEC standards, the International Energy Agency \n\npublished the Analytical Monitoring of Grid-connected Photovoltaic \n\nSystems: Good Practices for Monitoring and Performance Analysis  \n\nwhich discuss state-of-the-art of monitoring, PV loss mechanisms which \n\nare only detected by research-grade systems, promote the understanding \n\nof long-term system behavior and finally to divulge lessons from bad \n\nperforming systems (WOYTE et al., 2014).  \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\n2.5.2 Loss mechanisms of PV systems \n\nA performance ratio of 0.80 (or 80%) has historically been \n\nconsidered a good benchmark for a PV system in any location of the \n\nworld. However, as reported by Reich et al., more recently installed solar \n\nsystems in Germany have been performing at near 90% levels (REICH et \n\nal., 2012). \n\nThe 10-20% losses which would be associated with a 90-80% PR \n\nPV system arise from a series of mechanisms which are described as \n\nfollows: \n\n \n\na) Solar irradiation in the module plane \n\nAccording to the location of a solar system in the world, together \n\nwith its chosen tilt (inclination) and azimuth (orientation) angles, gains or \n\nlosses in irradiance capture occur. \n\nCommon system design practices suggest a tilt angle that matches \n\nthe latitude of the site or is close to it (DGS, 2008). However, other \n\nconsiderations should be taken into account before a decision on \n\ninstallation angles are taken (see soiling losses).  \nIn terms of azimuth, Northern locations will profit most from \n\nsystems facing South. Conversely, systems in the Southern hemisphere \n\nshould face the North for energy capture maximization. \n\nFor locations close to the Equator, which is the case of Singapore, \n\nit is possible that orientation towards North or South does not play such a \n\nmajor role, rather optimum performance is dictated by weather trends, for \n\nexample concentration of rain showers in the afternoon would mean \n\nsystems facing East will capture more sunlight and thus produce more \n\nelectricity (KHOO, NOBRE, et al., 2014).  \n\nNonetheless, irradiation capture gains in the order of 10-15% could \n\nbe achieved in a city like Freiburg, Germany (latitude = 48\u00b0N) by tilting \n\na PV system to ~40\u00b0 towards South. In low latitude locations, irradiation \n\ngains are little upon slight tilts. \n\nAs solar is still a young contributor to energy mixes in the world, \n\ntogether with the fact that feed-in tariffs and other compensation schemes \n\nto solar PV are usually linked to fixed payment amounts, we have not \n\nreached a turning point when it might be interesting to maximize even the \n\norientation of systems, thus generating more energy in the early morning \n\nor late afternoon portion of the day according to tariff variations. \n\nOrientation of systems could play a major role in a solar-dominated future \n\nwhere shift in demand might be desired (HUMMON et al., 2012). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n120 \n\nb) External shading \n\nExternal shading can be caused by horizon obstructions, e.g. \n\nmountains and buildings, but also closer structures such as chimneys and \n\ntrees. \n\nAlthough older methods exist, where one can draw obstructions \n\nwith the use of a transparent paper, new and more modern options to \n\nevaluate losses for external shading are presently available such as 3D \n\nmodeling (e.g. software Autodesk Ecotect, Google SketchUp) or with \n\nnew tools normally with a fish-eye camera device at hand (e.g. SunEye \n\ntool, from company Solmetric (SOLMETRIC, 2013). \n\nTropical locations have fewer problems with external shading due \n\nto high altitude angles of the sun in the sky. In Singapore, for example, \n\nthe lowest sun angle throughout the year is ~65?. Systems have shown to \n\noperate at high PR levels even when faced with challenging built-\n\nenvironment surroundings (ZOMER et al., 2014). \n\n \nc) Internal shading \n\nInternal shading takes place when portions of the solar system \n\nitself cast a shade onto other system sections. Row-induced shading is an \n\narea of concern for MW-size power plants but also inherent to smaller \n\nsystems which might be commissioned in several smaller sections due to \n\nspace constraints that can end up shading one another. \n\n \n\nd) Soiling losses \n\nWhen PV modules get dirty from dust or biological sources (e.g. \n\nbird droppings), the amount of light reaching the photovoltaic elements \n\nwill be reduced. Soiling losses are normally estimated at 1% (REICH et \n\nal., 2012) but are extremely location-dependent, e.g. would be higher in \narid countries (H. QASEM, 2011). \n\nAs discussed in loss mechanism a), if modules are installed at \n\nshallow angles (<10\u00b0) for maximization of solar resource for locations \n\nclose to the Equator, that could be detrimental in terms of soiling \n\naccumulation as rain cannot exert a proper self-cleaning effect onto the \n\nmodules\u2019 glass front surface. Figure 60 shows progressive images taken \n\nof a PV system in Singapore installed at zero degree tilt angle (i.e. flat), \n\nthus completely foregoing the self-cleaning effect, which can be \n\ndemonstrated by the considerable amount of dirt accumulation at the side \n\nof the modules, covering active PV cell areas. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\nFigure 60: Progression of soiling accumulation in an unmaintained PV \n\nsystem due to a flat tilt angle (source: SERIS).  \n\ne) Reflections \n\nA PV module has a front-glass cover (in the majority of \n\ntechnologies). Although special glass types with increased light-trapping \n\nproperties are present for most manufacturers, even such a special \n\ntreatment surface will reflect part of the incident light. \n\nFor this loss contributor, long-term experience from scientists have \n\nindicated deductions to be around 3% (HEYDENREICH, M\u00dcLLER, et \n\nal., 2008). For a location near the Equator like Singapore, with higher \nsolar elevation angles (as per Figure 32), the reflection losses tend to be \n\nlesser than compared to winter periods in a country like Germany, when \n\nthe sun is low in the sky, thus causing greater loss of irradiation due to \n\nreflections. \n\nKhoo et al. also studied angular reflectance losses among the \n\nclassical type of flat glass (planar) and a textured version special glass. \n\nThe textured glass was measured to show 1.4% better light trapping \n\ncapacity than the planar one after a 6-month testing period. Simulations \n\nyear-round also showed better performance by the special glass type \n\n(KHOO, SINGH, et al., 2014). \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n122 \n\nf) Irradiation mismatch \n\nFor the irradiation deviations from the standard test conditions \n\n(STC) value of 1,000 W/m2, Figure 42 shows for example how irradiance \n\nvalues throughout a year will vary at the 0-1,200 W/m2 range. Therefore, \n\nirradiance losses (or in this case under-, or for less instances over-\n\nproduction, i.e. > 1,000 W/m2 conditions) will occur for every instance \n\nthe conditions are not at the STC set-point. Software computes these \n\ndeductions based on the input meteorological file for a location, which \n\nwould inherently carry such irradiance statistics, thus allowing for loss \n\nestimations in the order of 3%. \n\n \n\ng) Spectrum mismatch \n\nFor the spectral mismatch from the standard test conditions (STC) \n\nvalue of 1.5 AM, PV systems will be exposed to a different variation of \n\nair masses during the day due to sun path geometry but weather \n\nconditions. A common estimation for these losses is around 1%, also seen \n\nin Heydenreich et al. (HEYDENREICH, M\u00dcLLER, et al., 2008) and \n\nReich et al. (REICH et al., 2012). \nYe et al. justified a red-shift spectrum in the tropical climate of \n\nSingapore as a reason for better performance of thin-film systems over \n\nsilicon wafer-based ones (YE et al., 2014a). Liu et al. demonstrated that \n\nthe red-shift is strongly reduced under hazy skies originated by forest fires \n\nin nearby Indonesia. Such contrary spectrum shift direction to the \n\npublication by Ye was shown to diminish performance ratios of thin-film \n\nsystems under polluted skies (LIU et al., 2014b). \n\n \nh) Temperature dependency \n\nThe single heaviest contributor to losses in the performance of PV \n\nsystems is the module temperature. STC conditions are set at 25\u00b0C, which \n\nis far from the real-world operating environment systems face. Modules \n\nare usually 25-30\u00b0C hotter than the ambient temperature (ROSS, 1976). \n\nModule temperature losses are even more important in the tropics \n\nas reported by Ye et al., (YE et al., 2013) and Nobre et al. (NOBRE, YE, \n\net al., 2012), see subsection 2.6.2. For silicon wafer-based technology, a \ntypical value for the temperature coefficient loss for maximum power is \n\n0.4%/K.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\ni) Module and string mismatch \n\nModule mismatch in recent times is not such a considerable system \n\nloss contributor as it once was (REICH et al., 2012). With tighter \n\ntolerances from manufacturers, module sorting became non-\n\nadvantageous versus the time consumption needed due to bigger system \n\nsizes. Losses are constrained to values well below 1%. \n\nSystem strings going into the same inverter MPPT also require \n\ncareful designing. With two strings, even with the same number of \n\nmodules, but different tilt or orientation angles can cause string mismatch \n\non the inverter MPPT, thus constraining the optimum operation \n\nconditions of that system section to the weakest link (with the worst I-V \n\ncurve maximum power point tracking relationship), thus causing \n\nunderperformance for the system as a whole (DGS, 2008). \n\n \n\nj) Ohmic losses \n\nDC-wiring losses are often restricted to assumptions in the order \n\nof 1.5% but can be calculated based on cable lengths and cross sections \n\n(DGS, 2008).  \n\nFor AC cabling losses, it is relative to the point of measurement of \n\nthe AC energy being produced by the system. If the energy produced by \n\nthe inverter is recorded by the inverter meter itself, AC ohmic losses could \n\nbe assumed to be negligible. However, most utility energy meters are \n\nfound at a certain distance from the inverter, mostly in separate \n\ndistribution boards, thus creating a second section of ohmic losses, \n\nalthough small, until the final energy recording which later is used for \n\nperformance ratio calculation. \n\n \n\nk) Inverter losses \n\n Inverters have become more efficient with the growth of the \n\nphotovoltaic market and subsequent technology advances. Some units \n\n(e.g. SMA 60 kVA transformerless series) can achieve up to 98.8% \n\nmaximum efficiency (SMA, 2015b). \n\n The selection of inverter to PV ratio has been discussed for many \n\nyears now with a loading ratio of 1.25 commonly used as a threshold \n\n(DGS, 2008). Burger and R\u00fcther investigated such ratios in relation to \n\nlocal solar resource (BURGER and R\u00dcTHER, 2006). Cloud-\n\nedge/enhancement effects, as discussed in subsection 2.3.2, could account \n\nfor inverter cut-offs and loss of revenue in a PV system. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n124 \n\n The \u201cBrazilian efficiency\u201d concept for inverters was first proposed \n\nand investigated  in a master\u2019s dissertation at Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, \n\nUSP (PINTO, 2012). It bases the loading profile of the inverter similarly \n\nto what the European (EU) and California (CEC, California Energy \n\nCommission) efficiencies do for their respective regions. However, it \n\ntakes into account the irradiance distribution profile for Brazil as a whole. \n\nZomer et al started the first implementation of the Brazilian efficiency \n\ninto software analysis of PV module performance assessment (ZOMER \net al., 2013). \n\n \n\nl) Inverter transformer losses \n\nSince the inverters of all systems under study in this thesis are \n\ntransformerless and not connected to any medium voltage level, \n\ntransformer losses are considered to be zero. However, big size PV \n\nsystems could receive energy meters at both the pre- and post- \n\ntransformer positions, with revenue meters mostly located at the closest \n\npoint to grid interfacing. \n\n2.5.3 Other factors influencing performance \n\nThe following mechanisms are usually not part of PV systems \n\nsimulation software. However, these contributors do affect performance \n\nand are most of the times rejected. They are discussed next: \n\n \n\nm) Wind speed \n\nIncreased ventilation in the surroundings of a system brings \n\nmodule temperatures down, consequently increasing system power \n\noutput (ROSS, 1976). \n\nReadings from the SERIS meteorological station (year 2011, see \n\nFigure 61) have shown lower average wind speeds of 1.4 m/s in \n\nSingapore, which motivated the foregoing of these sensors at PV system \n\nsites in local investigations. \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n\n \n\nFigure 61: Wind speed as recorded by the SERIS meteorological station for \n\nthe year 2011 (SERIS, 2011). \n\nVeldhuis et al. validated PV power modeling in Singapore and \n\nIndonesia, with and without wind taken into account. Root mean square \n\nerrors (RMSEs) between simplistic models adopted by Ye et al. (YE et \nal., 2013), not considering wind, versus more complex ones with wind \n\ninfluence, have shown small error variations and to work effectively in \n\nSingapore (VELDHUIS et al., 2013; VELDHUIS et al., 2015). \n\n \n\nn) System downtime \n\n According to IEC standards on the performance assessment of PV \n\nsystems (IEC, 1998), downtimes caused by various failures should be \n\nconsidered when assessing system quality. In its total life-cycle analysis, \n\ndowntime affects LCOEs (BIERI et al., 2015). One of the most classical \n\nforms of downtime is an inverter trip, which again could happen for a \n\nvariety of reasons, such as grid imbalances. Once inverters are down, the \n\nPV system goes into open-circuit voltage (VOC) and is not generating \n\nelectrical energy any longer. Other examples of system breakdowns are \n\nburnt surge arrestors (due to lightning) or burnt fuses. Some examples of \n\nscheduled downtime are PV system maintenance or in some cases, \n\nmonitoring system maintenance, which could affect recordings on site for \nirradiance and energy values being produced. \n\n Investors usually take in their business plans an arbitrary value of \n\n1% deduction in overall system performance (i.e. usage of a 99% uptime) \n\n(BIERI et al., 2015). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n126 \n\no) Optical depth of local atmosphere \n\nAerosols present in the air block sunlight from reaching the Earth\u2019s \n\nsurface. Optical depth (transmission of light from the top of the \n\natmosphere down to the ground) is affected by, for example, air pollution.  \n\nFor Singapore, it is somewhat common that forest fires in nearby \n\nIndonesia set smoke clouds in the region, especially during the months of \n\nAugust and September (driest periods of the year when fires are used for \n\nagriculture clearing), see 2.3.3. The example of haze influence on an \n\nirradiance sensor and on a PV system is shown in Figure 62, with the clear \n\nsky irradiance and theoretical maximum power indicated. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 62: Irradiation on ground level and yield of a PV system on both a \n\nclear sky day (PSI = 54) and on a hazy day (PSI = 109) (NOBRE et al., 2015 \n\n(accepted)). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n127 \n\nFigure 62 (top row) shows the in-plane global irradiance of a PV \n\nsystem on a relatively clear sky day in June 2014 (with a 24-hour \n\nPollution Standards Index, PSI average of 54) compared against the time \n\nseries on a hazy, yet cloudless day in June 2013 (24-hour PSI = 109). A \n\nreduction of approximately 14% in irradiation is shown for the \n\ncomparison of those two days. When performing the same check on the \n\nnormalized AC power output of a PV system for the same two days, the \n\nreduction in electricity production follows a similar pattern (~13% \n\nreduction, Figure 62, bottom row). While there is a clear visual effect on \n\nthe dimming of the irradiation at ground level on this exceptional day \n\n(hazy but cloudless), the quantification of the haze effect is a challenging \n\nexercise for typical day to day conditions, when clouds are likely to be \n\npresent in the tropical climate of Singapore. Determining the weather \n\nconditions with and without the presence of the haze and how that affects \n\nexisting PV systems in Singapore is a complex exercise. \n\nBurning of biomass is also present in Brazil and could affect \n\naerosol particle concentration (MARTINS et al., 2008). Although great \n\nforest reserves are farther apart from big centers, it is highly possible that \n\nwith the deployment of larger volumes of PV systems, some of these \n\ninstallations in the future end by suffering loss of power due to nearby \n\nfire particulate emissions, or even in some cases, industrial pollution \n\nemissions. Major city-centers like S\u00e3o Paulo pose similar challenges in \n\nterms of hazy skies as shown in Figure 62. However, the smog in this case \n\nis caused mostly by automobile exhaust as well as potentially, to some \n\nlevel, by industrial emissions.  \n\n \n\np) PV system degradation \n\nPV systems do degrade with time. A combination of soiling \n\naccumulation which might not be entirely removable, increase in series \n\nresistance in aging solar cells, module delamination, front glass \n\n\u201cyellowing\u201d caused by extended UV-exposure, among other factors could \n\ntrigger an ageing mechanism to PV modules and consequently to systems. \n\nNREL has studied more than 4,000 research results throughout the world \n\n(JORDAN and KURTZ, 2013) and has summarized their finds to \n\ndegradation rates of an average of -0.5% per annum, which is also a \n\nwidely utilized figure both from module manufacturers perspective (when \n\nplanning their warranties) but also from investors (when conducting their \n\nbusiness plans). A recent study, however, showed an average degradation \n\nof -0.8% per annum of a 20-year-old PV system in Colorado, United \n\nStates (JORDAN et al., 2015). Another study in a subtropical island in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n128 \n\nthe south of Brazil showed an average output reduction of -0.55% per year \n\nfor a thin-film amorphous silicon PV installation over a 15-year period \n\n(DO NASCIMENTO and RUTHER, 2014). \n\nIn a constantly hot and humid climate, these numbers have been \n\ndemonstrated to be higher. Degradation on single piece PV modules was \n\nassessed by Ye et al. in Singapore with annual rates ranging from -0.8% \n\nto -6.0% depending on the module technology (YE et al., 2014b). On a \n\nsystem level, Nobre et al. reported median annual degradation rates of -\n\n1.2% for crystalline-based systems in Singapore (NOBRE et al., 2013).  \n\nOne way to monitor system degradation is via long-term PR \n\nassessment as shown by R\u00fcther et al. (RUTHER et al., 2010a) and Kiefer \n\net al. (K. KIEFER, 2010). A novel method was proposed by the author of \n\nthis thesis where both DC and AC sides of PV systems were investigated, \n\nwith continuous daily performance ratio readings, which later receive a \n\nstatistical treatment, whereby a 2-sigma filter is applied to remove values \n\nof performance which are not associated with the customary behavior of \n\nthe PV system. Figure 63 displays one of the example analysis conducted, \n\nwith degradation assessment both on the DC- and AC-sides of a PV \n\nsystem. In this example, the system\u2019s DC-side, e.g. solar modules and \n\ncabling all the way to the inverter\u2019s input, has shown degradation through \n\n~1,100 days of approximately -0.6% per annum (dark blue circles, daily \n\nPR values). The light blue circles represent daily PR values on the AC-\n\nside of the system, taking the entire ensemble into account, all the way to \n\nthe final energy meter. For the PV system shown, an AC-side degradation \n\nof -0.8% was found. \n\nIn the investigation as a whole, results have shown median \n\ndegradation rates above current literature values (-0.5% p.a. for AC-side \n\ndegradation) for both silicon crystalline wafer-based and silicon thin-film \n\ntechnologies (-0.7% p.a. for DC- and -1.5% p.a. for AC-sides of silicon \n\nwafer-based systems and -1.2% p.a. (DC) and -1.6% p.a. (AC) for silicon \n\nthin-film based systems). While these conclusions are limited by the \n\nnumber of years for which data are available, for the first 1.5 to 3 years \n\nof operation, there is no trend that the degradation would slow down with \n\ntime thus far. More investigations were performed and addressed in \n\npublications and results and discussions section of this thesis. \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n\n \n\nFigure 63: Degradation of a PV system in Singapore after ~1,100 days of \n\noperation (NOBRE et al., 2013). \n\n2.5.4 PV system performance in warm climates \n\nWith more and more large photovoltaic (PV) markets emerging in \n\nhot and humid tropical areas, PV systems are to be specifically designed \n\nin line with the local conditions to ensure optimized performance. Newly-\n\ninstalled systems in Germany, the country currently with the largest \n\ninstalled capacity worldwide, have improved their performance ratios \n\n(PR) from the 50-75% range in the late 80s to close to 90% for state-of-\n\nthe-art systems in recent times (REICH et al., 2012) and shown in 2.5.1. \n\nIt is only natural that most of the research on PV topics has been \n\nfocused where booming markets are. In the area of PV systems, isolated \n\nefforts have taken place for PV systems in the tropics (FAN, 2007; \n\nRUTHER et al., 2010a; b; WITTKOPF et al., 2012).  \n\nA more comprehensive investigation has shown a performance \n\nratio median close to 80% for crystalline wafer-based PV systems in \n\ntropical Singapore (NOBRE, YE, et al., 2012). In the work, the \nperformance ratios of 11 silicon wafer-based systems for the one-year \n\nmeasurement period were shown (Figure 64). The best-in-class system \n\n(A) operated with a PR of 82.6% and the worst-performing system (K) \n\ndelivered only a PR of 58.1%. Typical system flaws leading to lower \n\nperformance include for example: unreliable components (modules, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n130 \n\ninverters failures), wrong selection of cable sizes, a faulty AC switch \n\nfrequently causing electrical trips, or burnt fuses. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 64: Performance ratio of 11 crystalline wafer-based systems in \n\nSingapore (NOBRE, YE, et al., 2012). \n\n At the time of the investigation on the previously mentioned work, \n\nthose systems represented approximately 20% of the entire PV installed \n\ncapacity in Singapore (~4 MWp). This shows that it is not uncommon to \n\nobserve PR values of 80-82%, despite the harsh tropical climate \n\nconditions found \u2013 annual ambient temperatures between 23-35\u00b0C and \n\nrelative humidity levels between 60-85% (NEA, 2009), with low \n\nseasonality effects for the country. \n\nWith the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) \n\ndemonstrating that state-of-the-art photovoltaic systems in Germany have \n\nreached the 90% performance ratio mark (REICH et al., 2012), the \n\ninvestigation for similar results for a tropical location were set for the \nunderstanding of PR behavior in such harsh environments. Module \n\ntemperature was found to contribute between 45-60% of all losses from \n\nPV systems in Singapore. As module temperature is the most influential \n\nparameter, a subsequent publication under preparation aims to tackle the \n\n\n\n \n\n131 \n\nreasons for the delta in PRs between temperate and tropical locations. \n\nFigure 65 gives an indication of the reasons behind the effects, with \n\nmodule temperature in Singapore in general much hotter than in \n\nGermany. State-of-the-art PV systems in Singapore can operate today at \n\n~85% PRs whereas European systems can reach up to 90%, as previously \n\npresented. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 65: The monthly spectrum of variation in the PR losses between a PV \n\nsystem in Singapore and one in Germany (NOBRE et al., 2015 (in \n\npreparation)). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n132 \n\n2.5.5 National Solar Repository of Singapore \n\nThe National Solar Repository of Singapore (NSR) was officially \n\nlaunched in November 2010, part of the local government initiative \n\nthrough its Economic Development Board (EDB) to promote solar \n\nphotovoltaics in the country. The repository works as a database and \n\ninformation portal for relevant stakeholders in solar photovoltaics in \n\nSingapore (NSR, 2013a). \n\nThe repository has a three-fold goal: \n\n \n\n? Create awareness about existing photovoltaic installations in \nSingapore, generating enthusiasm with the population about this \n\nform of clean energy technology; \n\n \n\n? Help optimize performance of solar PV installations in Singapore \nby comparing and analyzing system behavior on a monthly and \n\nannual basis, setting country-wide benchmarks for system \n\ntechnology; \n \n\n? Act as the information platform in the country for solar PV basics \nor whom to contact for installation financing of a solar system. \n\nThe NSR contains information on several types of PV systems \n\nsuch as the ones shown in Figure 66. PV installations in commercial \n\nbuildings (left) are monitored for their output on a monthly basis, together \n\nwith industrial sites (top right), residential systems (middle right) and \n\neducational or research systems (bottom right). Some of the systems \n\nprovide daily output records, which allow for more detailed investigations \n\nby the initiative.  \n\nAs of late 2014, the NSR platform tracked one fourth of the PV \n\nsystems available in Singapore (in terms of volume, circa 9 MWp out of \n\na total of 33 MWp deployed in the country). Photos of the systems and \n\ntheir locations are shown in a map, as well as the system characteristics \n\nin a database. \n\n Perhaps most importantly is the information the initiative provides \n\non system performance. Figure 67 is a summary of systems\u2019 annual yields \n\n(MWh/kWp per year) for the year 2013. The results account for systems\u2019 \n\nfailures in the field, e.g. inverter downtime and are thus not adjusted for \n\nonly optimum performance values. The average of 1.08 MWh/kWp for 56 \n\nsystems in the country (approximately one third of the entire installed \n\ncapacity of solar PV in Singapore at the time of the analysis) highlights \n\n\n\n \n\n133 \n\nthe current state-of-the-art for the country in PV system technology (NSR, \n\n2013b). The average irradiation as measured by several SERIS \n\nmeteorological stations indicated an annual value for GHI of 1,578 \n\nkWh/m2, which allows the inference that the average system performance \n\nratio in Singapore is just under 70%, a value which is far from what state-\n\nof-the-art PV systems can ultimately deliver today, thus, an indication that \n\nsystem design and implementation is not optimum in the country. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 66: NSR PV system category examples \u2013 commercial, industrial, \n\nresidential and educational systems are categorized in the database (NSR, \n\n2013c). \n\nThe solar resource as assessed by the SERIS meteorological station \n\nis perhaps the most reliable reading of solar irradiance in the country for \n\nPV applications, with highest data availability (above 99.5% of data \n\ncollected) and optimum data reliability (weekly cleaning of sensors and \n\ntight maintenance practices). The average daily global horizontal \n\nirradiance recorded over the same 2.5 years was 4.32 kWh/m2 per day, \n\nwhich would represent a meteorological year average of 1,577 kWh/m2, \n\n-3.3% versus long-term TMY for Singapore as portrayed in subsection \n\n2.3.2. All in all, with shallow installation tilt angles, it could be assumed \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n134 \n\nthat this average output for 43 installations has a performance ratio of \n\napproximately 72%. As demonstrated in the previous subsection, a \n\nresearch median of ~80% had been validated, an 8% gap versus the \n\ncountry\u2019s benchmark. This highlights that there is considerable room for \n\nimprovement for PV systems performance throughout the island as new \n\ninstallations come online.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 67: NSR 2013 benchmarking results for PV systems in Singapore \n\n(NSR, 2015d). \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n\n2.6 PV SYSTEMS MODELING \n\n2.6.1 Available tools \n\nOne of the most used commercially available software for PV \n\nsystem modeling is PVSYST (PVSYST, 2013). Most system integrators \n\nuse this tool for system design, performance assessment and DC electrical \n\nrange checks such as for operational voltages and currents of module \n\nstrings. \n\nAnother software commonly used is PV*SOL, from the Solar \n\nDesign Company (PV*SOL, 2013). \n\nAs an example of other software, for its CERP-02 research project \n\non PV systems performance in the tropics, SERIS used the PV systems \n\nmodeling software \u201cZenit\u201d, from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar \n\nEnergy Systems (ISE). The in-house built software is a compendium of \n\ntwo decades of experience of the German institute in PV systems yield \n\nand performance assessment. \n\n2.6.2 Existing research in PV systems modeling \n\nHeydenreich et al. (HEYDENREICH, MUELLER, et al., 2008) \n\ntested a PV power model using three parameters (a, b, c) to characterize \n\nthe efficiency curves of PV devices. The authors applied flash testing to \n\nseveral crystalline silicon modules in order to empirically test the \n\nappropriate three parameters intended. The formula for the model \n\nfollows:  \n\n \n\n????,25\n(???? ) = ????? + ? ln(???? + 1) + ? [??\n\n2 (???? +?)\n\n(????+1)\n? 1]  (9) \n\n \n\nwhere ?mpp,25 is the efficiency of the PV module at 25\u00b0C at its maximum \n\npower point (MPP) efficiency, Gmod is the irradiance on the plane of the \n\narray, and a, b, c the model values derived empirically in the study. \n\nContinuing, Equation 9 yields the module MPP efficiency only at the \n\ncondition of device temperature at 25\u00b0C. For the efficiency adjustment at \n\nother temperature ranges, Equation 10 should be applied: \n\n \n\n????,25\n(???? , ???? ) = ????,25(???? )[1 + ?(???? ? 25\u00b0)]   (10) \n\n \n\nwhere ?mpp is the efficiency of the photovoltaic device at a given \n\ntemperature, Tmod is the module temperature and ? is the temperature \n\ncoefficient of the MPP power. A common value for ? in crystalline silicon \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n136 \n\nmodules is -0.0045\u00b0C-1, as found in the specifications of the majority of \n\nPV panels. In order to estimate module temperatures, the following \n\nEquation is valid, for the condition of no wind, which is often the case in \n\nSingapore: \n\n \n\n???? = ???? + ?????       (11) \n \n\nwhere Tamb is the ambient temperature, with ? commonly referred to as \n\nthe Ross coefficient, dependent on installation mounting type (ROSS, \n\n1976). A typical value used for ? is 0.020\u00b0Cm2W-1 for ground-mounted \n\ninstallations with good ventilation. \n\nState-of-the-art PV systems in Germany started to achieve close to \n\n90% performance ratios, with temperature-related losses accounting for \n\n~20% and ~45% of the total system losses for winter and summer months, \n\nrespectively (REICH et al., 2012). A recent study on PV simulation using \n\n29 PV systems in Spain and predominantly in Germany showed \n\ndifferences in yield estimations and actual field output due primarily to \n\nsolar brightening (the irradiation databases, based on past decades \n\nrecords, present lower annual irradiation levels than recent records). The \n\ncombined uncertainty of yield predictions today lies at 8%, as shown in \n\nM\u00fcller et al. (M\u00dcLLER et al., 2015).   \n\nAfter using numerical weather prediction forecasts for the entire \n\nEurope zone, Lorenz et al. (LORENZ et al., 2011) have performed an up-\n\nscaling routine for PV systems in Germany using a baseline of \n\nrepresentative installations in order to predict future system output for the \n\nmany thousands of other systems in the country. Input parameters were \n\nforecasted irradiance up to two days ahead in hourly resolutions, achieved \n\nby the numerical model prediction, with ambient temperature playing a \n\nrole in determining module temperature (as per Equation 11) taking into \n\naccount a number of assumptions.  \n\nAs an example in Asia, researchers conducted a comprehensive \n\ninvestigation on power forecast for day-ahead applications in more than \n\n700 PV systems in Japan (FONSECA_JR. et al., 2013). The study found \n\nthat for systems tilted above 40 degrees, higher forecast errors were \n\nidentified in the modeling.  \n\n2.6.3 Challenges of modeling in tropical conditions \n\nWith a research-grade software which had been previously and \n\nextensively validated in a temperate location of the world \n\n(HEYDENREICH, M\u00dcLLER, et al., 2008; REICH et al., 2012), the \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n\nsoftware from Fraunhofer ISE was further put to test at a different climatic \n\ncondition in the world in tropical Singapore.  \n\nDetailed loss mechanisms are shown as two-bar clusters (see \n\nFigure 68, with measured (left bars) and simulated (right bars) values of \n\n11 silicon wafer-based PV systems under monitoring in Singapore. \n\nSimulation of systems A through F were within \u00b12% of the actual \n\nmeasured results, while PV systems G through K experienced technical \n\nfaults during operation, causing larger deviations of the measured values \n\nfrom the \"ideal behavior\", which is the outcome of the simulation \n\nsoftware. \n\nSimulations were performed with the software \u201cZenit\u201d, developed \n\nby Fraunhofer ISE and adjusted by SERIS for the local irradiance and \n\ntemperature conditions in the tropics. The irradiance data inserted into the \n\nsimulation is the same as read by the silicon sensors on site, hence soiling \n\nand reflection losses are not computed, assuming that the same conditions \n\nexperienced by the silicon sensors will prevail also at the PV systems \n\n(since both are of similar materials and installed at the same inclination \n\nangles) and, for Singapore, kept uncleaned.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 68: Simulated versus measured loss mechanisms of 11 PV systems in \n\nSingapore (NOBRE, YE, et al., 2012). \n\nAnalyzing systems A through F, it can be seen that the largest \n\ndifference between measured and simulated results was 1.7% for system \n\nA, which is in line with previous publications that reported uncertainties \n\nin the \u00b12.0% range (REICH et al., 2012). For the subsequent systems G \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n138 \n\nthrough K, individual explanations were given to their sub-optimum \n\noperational (measured) behavior (NOBRE, YE, et al., 2012). \n\nZomer et al. used Zenit for simulations of PV systems in Brazilian \n\nairports (ZOMER et al., 2013), as well as taking the \u201cBrazilian \n\nEfficiency\u201d for inverters (PINTO, 2012) into account. \n\nYe et al. showed that module temperatures in the field in Singapore \n\ncan reach almost a 3-fold variation from coolest to hottest systems (see \n\nFigure 69). The scatter of the temperature differences were explained \n\nqualitatively in the publication as being caused by four major factors: (1) \n\nroof top material, usually made of concrete or metal; (2) module-to-\n\nground separation, from a few centimeters all the way to more than 1 m \n\ngap; (3) whether modules are framed or frameless, with the framed ones \n\npresenting an extra barrier for natural ventilation flow; and (4) other \n\nenvironmental aspects, such as being close to a nature reserve, as opposed \n\nto being located in a highly-dense environment and subjected to \u201curban \n\nheat islands\u201d (YE et al., 2013). \n \n\n \n\nFigure 69: Module and ambient temperature variations with irradiance for \n\n17 PV systems in Singapore (YE et al., 2013). \n\nNobre et al. have demonstrated that this model is valid for a \n\ndifferent tropical location around the world. Three PV systems in Brazil \n\nwere used within the calculation methodology which had been previously \n\nproposed for Singapore (NOBRE, MONTENEGRO, et al., 2012).  \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n\n3. METHOD \n \n\n3.1 PRELIMINARY REMARKS \n\n3.1.1 R&amp;D supporting infrastructure and overview \n\nThis thesis had the goal of advancing knowledge on short-term \n\nsolar irradiance forecasting in tropical regions of the world, together with \n\nadding further value by including actual power output know-how gained \n\nfrom already deployed PV systems in preparation for a future with a \n\nconsiderable share of renewables in electricity matrices. \n\nResearch data collection within past R&amp;D projects in Singapore \n\nstarted in 2009 for PV systems and weather parameters alike. With the \n\naccumulation of historical data from these projects, plus the addition of \n\nnew meteorological stations and PV installations to the country\u2019s \n\nnetwork, past and present datasets allowed and continue to allow new \n\nfindings in solar resource forecasting and systems behavior for the \n\ntropics. \n\nAs stated in the objectives, enhancements to solar irradiance \n\nforecasting on short time scales (such as 15-min, 30-min and 1-hr forecast \n\nhorizons) were covered first. After obtaining irradiance values ahead of \n\ntime, PV systems performance was taken into account, both by \n\nunderstanding loss mechanisms in PV systems as well as their long-term \n\noperational behavior, trying to minimize errors throughout the processes. \n\nSources of data enabling the investigation towards its main and \n\nspecific goals stem from research projects from the Solar Energy \n\nResearch Institute of Singapore (SERIS), namely: \n\n \n\n? Irradiance and general meteorological data arising from the \nClean Energy Research Program (CERP-04 project call) \u2013 \n\n\u201cNovel monitoring and control unit for enhanced availability and \n\nreliability of solar PV systems \u2013 optimization of photovoltaic \n\nelectricity generation in tropical power grids through radiation \n\nforecasting and system monitoring\u201d, a 3-year long research \n\nproject managed by SERIS, which took place between 2011 and \n\n2014; \n\n \n\n? PV systems operational data from the CERP-02 project call \u2013 \n\u201cHigh performance PV systems for tropical regions \u2013 \n\noptimization of system performance\u201d, a 3-year long research \n\nproject, also managed by SERIS, between 2009 and 2012; \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n140 \n\n? PV systems monthly energy output data (for some sites, daily) \nfrom the National Solar Repository of Singapore (NSR) \n\ninitiative, an ongoing research activity led by SERIS, which \n\nallows for country-wide up-scaling exercises. \n\n \n\nAlthough the CERP-02 and -04 projects were officially completed, \n\nthe data acquisition is still ongoing, which allows for further weather \n\nknowledge gains and long-term PV system behavior studies. \n\nThis thesis focuses on irradiance forecasting at short-term intervals \n\ntogether with a full PV power conversion routine validation of the \n\npredicted results towards PV system performance assessment ahead of \n\ntime. In a sense, an \u201cirradiance-to-kWh\u201d chain of events but taking place \n\nbefore the electricity is actually produced. Figure 70 illustrates and \n\nsummarizes the work intended, with inputs for proposed forecasts \n\npowered by algorithms using from meteorological parameters, as well as \n\ndata from PV systems readily available for method validation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 70: Illustration of proposed method: \u201cIrradiance-to-kWh\u201d \n\nsimulation and validation (adapted for this thesis). \n\nThe network of ground-irradiance sensors deployed in Singapore \nis one of the densest in the world. It is also easy to maintain due primarily \n\nto the proximity of stations to the SERIS building (longest distance which \n\nthe team needs to commute for access is ~35 km). \n\nExisting stochastic and artificial intelligence methods are explored \n\nfor short-term irradiance forecasting. The performances of the methods \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\nare compared to determine which are more suitable for this region of the \n\nworld. Additionally, a novel Hybrid model is introduced in an attempt to \n\ncurtail prediction errors. \n\nEmpirical data of the thesis comes from a fine-grid area of ground-\n\nbased stations measuring global horizontal irradiance as well as other \n\nmeteorological parameters. The network of 25 ground-measurement \n\nstations was completed in November 2013. The PV sites used for power \n\nconversion modeling were first deployed in January 2010, with fifteen \n\nsites at the completion of this thesis accounting for ~1 MWp of PV \n\nsystems of various sizes, technologies and tilt &amp; azimuth angles. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n142 \n\n3.1.2 Boundary conditions of the investigations \n\nForecasting irradiance for photovoltaic applications means \n\nessentially predicting the global horizontal irradiation (GHI) at future \n\ntime steps. The thesis is centered on a short-term application setting. \n\nChallenges do exist in modeling irradiance on the plane of the array \n\nof a PV system, and later photovoltaic energy generation (kWh), at lower \n\nirradiance values (&lt;100 W/m2) due mainly to: \n\n \n\ni. Complex shading onto irradiance devices due to external \nnearby structures (buildings, trees), as well as horizon shading \n\nfrom a heavily-urbanized environment as the one found in \n\nSingapore; \n\n \n\nii. Precision of irradiance measurement devices (especially silicon \nsensors) at very steep solar elevations angles, which take place \n\nin early mornings and late afternoons; \n\n \n\nMoreover, electricity demand peaks usually occur between 10 am \n\nand 5 pm for Singapore (see Figure 8) as well as the majority of the \n\nelectricity production from solar PV systems (see Figure 42, with most of \n\nthe irradiance values falling within the 300-900 W/m2 range). Therefore, \n\nthe algorithms and tests within this thesis focus on an 8-hour window of \n\ninterest \u2013 ranging from 9 am to 5 pm \u2013 on a daily basis.  \n\nValidation of the proposed and under scrutiny methods is achieved \n\nthrough data from ~1 MWp worth of PV systems from an existing \n\nportfolio (~3% of the installed capacity of the country as of December \n\n2014). Up-scaling is later investigated thanks to data from the National \n\nSolar Repository of Singapore (NSR), with ~9 MWp of systems (~1/4 of \n\nthe installations in the country in volume terms). Up-scaling is later \n\ndescribed in subsection 3.4.4.  \n\nFor the forecasting windows, the shortest interval is set for 15-min, \n\nwith a second interval selected for 30-min, matching dispatch cycle of \n\nelectricity trading in Singapore (EMA, 2013). A further horizon window \n\nof 1-hr is also put to test. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\n3.2 SOURCES OF DATA \n\n3.2.1 Ground-measured irradiance data \n\nThis thesis focuses on solar irradiance forecasting for the location \n\nSingapore together with power conversion for PV applications. Figure 71 \n\nshows the ground-based meteorological station network deployed by \n\nSERIS throughout the island as part of the research project \u201cCERP-04\u201d. \n\nIn order to obtain the ground measurement readings at a good \n\nspatial resolution, 25 stations of the project were distributed across \n\nSingapore using a 5x5 km grid as reference, trying to achieve the best \n\ndistribution possible. Some locations are off-bound military zones or \n\nprotected tropical rain forests or reservoirs, which prevented a more \n\nuniform distribution of the meteorological stations. \n\n \n\nFigure 71: Singapore\u2019s 25 ground-based stations of the CERP-04 research \n\n(adapted for this thesis). \n\nThe original CERP-04 network of stations is composed of eight \n\nstations which are called \u201csuperstations\u201d, with the remaining seventeen \n\nnamed \u201cbasic stations\u201d. The difference between these stations lies on the \n\nvariety of meteorological sensors installed in each of them. A superstation \n\nhas two readings of global horizontal irradiance (GHI), one with a \n\ncalibrated silicon sensor (manufacturer: Mencke &amp; Tegtmeyer, Germany) \n\nand one with an SPN1 pyranometer (manufacturer: Delta-T, United \n\nKingdom). The SPN1 pyranometer also measures the diffuse irradiance \n\nvia an internal algorithm and readings from seven small thermopiles, with \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n144 \n\na shadow mask mounted inside its glass dome. Other sensors available at \n\na superstation are ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, \n\nwind direction and finally an air pressure sensor. A basic station, on the \n\nother hand, is a small setup and has only the calibrated silicon sensor, \n\nambient temperature and relative humidity sensors. Such selection of \n\nsensors guaranteed that all 25 stations of the network had a \u201ccommon \n\ndenominator\u201d, that is, three key readings which are crucial for irradiance \n\nmapping and forecasting, as well as necessary inputs for PV systems \n\nsimulation, when needed. A basic and a superstation can be seen in Figure \n\n72. \n  \n\n \n\nFigure 72: Basic meteorological station #425 (left) and superstation #408 \n\n(right, wind sensors not pictured) (source: SERIS). \n\n The sensors deployed at super and basic stations of the island-wide \n\nnetwork are described in Table 9. The three sensors present in all stations \n\n(common denominators) for the entire island are marked in red. The \n\nsuperstation sensors are further described in the table (marked in blue), \n\ntogether with all associated uncertainties of these devices. \n\nDue to the high costs of a superstation, only a certain number of \n\nthem were deployed arising from project budget constraints. The goal \n\ntherefore was to disperse them in a way that they cover strategic points of \n\nthe island, with special attention in putting several of these stations on the \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\noutskirts of Singapore, with such a strategy later leveraged and discussed \n\nin subsection 3.3.2. \n\nTable 9: Measurement uncertainties of super and basic stations of the \n\nnetwork (source: adapted from sensor manufacturers). \n\nParameter Description/ \n\nDevice \n\nManufacturer/\n\nModel \n\nUncertainty Super/\n\nBasic \n\nGHISi Global horizontal \n\nirradiance/ \n\nsilicon sensor \n\nMencke &amp; \n\nTegtmeyer/ \n\nSi-02-PT100-K \n\n\u00b12.0% lab4, \n\n\u00b15.0% field \nBasic \n\nTamb Ambient \n\ntemperature/ \n\nPT100 probe \n\n \n\nThies Clima/ \n\nPT100, Class B \n\n\u00b10.2 K Basic \n\nHamb Relative humidity/ \n\ncapacitive element \n\nThies Clima/ \n\n1.1005.54.000 \n\n\u00b12.0% Basic \n\nGHISPN1 Global horizontal \n\nirradiance/ \n\npyranometer \n\nDelta-T/ \n\nSunshine \n\npyranometer \n\n\u00b15.0% Super \n\nDHISPN1 Diffuse horizontal \n\nirradiance/ \n\npyranometer \n\nDelta-T/ \n\nSunshine \n\npyranometer \n\n\u00b15.0% Super \n\nWS Wind speed/ \n\ncup anemometer \n\nThies Clima/ \n\n4.3519.00.141 \n\n\u00b10.5% Super \n\nWD Wind direction/ \n\nwind vane \n\nThies Clima/ \n\n4.3129.60.141 \n\n\u00b12\u00b0 Super \n\nAirP Air pressure/ \n\nbarometer \n\nThies Clima/ \n\nB-278-1T \n\n\u00b10.3 hPa at \n\n20\u00b0C \nSuper \n\n \n\nTable 10 describes each station in terms of district location in \n\nSingapore, its global positioning system (GPS) coordinates and altitude. \n\nAll GPS coordinates were acquired with a Garmin Forerunner 310XT \n\nGPS watch, with a stated precision according to satellite signal strength \n\nat the moment of recording of \u00b110 m. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                        \n4 All silicon sensors of the SERIS research projects are calibrated either at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar \n\nEnergy Systems\u2019 (ISE) CalLab or at the National Metrology Centre in Singapore (NMC) at highest accuracy \n\nlevels available for research applications.

The proximity to the Equator allows for no predominant azimuth, \n\nwith most PV systems following the building geometry. However, as \n\nshown in Figure 35, it has been previously investigated that the best tilt \n\nand orientation angles for PV systems in Singapore are ~10\u00ba and ~90\u00ba \n\nEast-facing, respectively (KHOO, NOBRE, et al., 2014). \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n148 \n\nTable 11: Basic information for 33 PV sub-systems under monitoring at 15 \n\nsites via the SERIS\u2019 CERP-02 research project (adapted for this thesis). \n\nPV \n\n# \n\nTechnology Size \n\n[kWp] \n\nTilt \n\n[\u00b0] \n\nAzimuth \n\n[0-360\u00b0] \n\nDistrict in \n\nSingapore \n\n101a a-Si 4.9 12 50 NE Sentosa \n\n102a p-Si 5.2 11 10 N Clementi \n\n103a m-Si 4.8 15 200 SW Dover \n\n104a p-Si 15.0 6 220 SW Woodlands \n\n105a m-Si 10.4 7 205 SW Sembawang \n\n106a p-Si 13.5 6 130 SE Tuas \n\n106b p-Si 167.4 10~16 130 SE Tuas \n\n107a p-Si 60.8 10 10 N Tuas \n\n107b p-Si 91.1 10 190 S Tuas \n\n108a p-Si 3.8 flat - Bukit Timah \n\n109a a-Si 5.1 10 220 SW Bishan \n\n110a a-Si 162.7 5 340 N Changi \n\n111a a-Si 4.8 19 70 NE Frankel \n\n111b \u00b5c-Si 3.8 6 250 SW Frankel \n\n112a m-Si 2.1 10 0 N Clementi \n\n112b p-Si 2.0 10 0 N Clementi \n\n112c a-Si 2.1 10 0 N Clementi \n\n113a HIT 6.3 10 200 SW Clementi \n\n113b a-Si 4.0 10 200 SW Clementi \n\n113c p-Si 5.6 10 200 SW Clementi \n\n113d p-Si 4.6 10 200 SW Clementi \n\n113e p-Si 4.6 10 200 SW Clementi \n\n114a p-Si 19.7 10 0 N Boon Lay \n\n114b p-Si 19.7 10 180 S Boon Lay \n\n114c p-Si 19.7 10 90 E Boon Lay \n\n114d p-Si 19.7 10 270 W Boon Lay \n\n114e p-Si 42.1 10 0 N/180 S Boon Lay \n\n114f p-Si 95.9 10 0 N Boon Lay \n\n114g p-Si 14.1 10 0 N/180 S Boon Lay \n\n115a m-Si 43.2 8 110 SE Yishun \n\n115b p-Si 37.4 8 110 SE Yishun \n\n115c a-Si 42.0 8 110 SE Yishun \n\n115d m-Si 14.5 3 20 N Yishun \n\n TOTAL 952.8    \n\n \n\nAll SERIS monitoring systems record the investigated parameters \n\nas one minute averages, with a sampling rate of 1 Hz.

In some of the subsystems, the full \n\nDC side of the PV array is included as part of the monitoring setup, while \n\nfor other larger and more complex systems, only one or some reference \n\nDC strings were chosen for the monitoring. \n\n No wind sensors (for speed and direction measurements) were \n\noriginally installed at sites, since wind speed in Singapore is relatively \n\nlow, with daily mean values not higher than 2.8 m/s (NEA, 2009). The \n\nSERIS meteorological station installed at its headquarters rooftop \n\nreported a daily average of 1.4 m/s for 2011, as shown in Figure 61. \n\n It is expected that loggers utilized in the research add errors in the \n\norder of \u00b10.2%. Some further errors may be introduced in the form of \n\ntransducers, e.g. those needed to read the shunt voltage measurements. \nEventually, it can be expected that the overall uncertainty of the \n\nperformance ratio measurements under these conditions is within \u00b13.0%, \n\nin line with previous similar scientific investigations conducted in Europe \n\n(M\u00dcLLER et al., 2015; REICH et al., 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n150 \n\n3.2.3 Robustness of the data collection infrastructure \n\n A challenge on the data collection front for such locations in the \n\ntropics concerns the logging hardware infrastructure. The rough \n\nenvironment conditions posed to monitoring system housings under the \n\nsun present challenges for the logger and other components such as sensor \n\ntransducers. As seen in the thermal image of Figure 74, the temperature \n\ninside a monitoring cabinet in Singapore can easily reach values above \n\n50\u00b0C and due to the annual weather similarity, with the absence of \n\nseasons, these conditions happen almost on a daily basis. Therefore, \n\nindustrial-grade setups were used for the logging hardware (here from \n\ncompany National Instruments). Such practice of using higher-end \n\nmonitoring systems hardware guaranteed overall system data availability \n\nrates greater than 99.5% throughout the course of the investigations. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 74: Thermography of a monitoring cabinet at around noon (source: \n\nSERIS). \n\nIn order to properly perform correlation exercises between \n\nstations, time synchronization is critical. All 25 meteorological stations \n\nof the network, as well as the 15 PV system sites, run according to the \n\nsame time server at the SERIS\u2019 PV Systems Monitoring Laboratory. Once \n\nthe clock at a remote station deviates by 150 ms against the master clock \nof the server, a correction routine is applied. This method guarantees that \n\nremote stations are at a maximum 0.3 seconds adrift from one another.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n151 \n\n3.3 METHODS FOR IRRADIANCE FORECASTING \n\n3.3.1 Utilization of existing forecasting techniques \n\nThe thesis investigations saw tests with several forecasting \n\ntechniques as follows: \n\n \n\n[1] Persistence \n\n \n\nPersistence is the most common method utilized in general \n\nforecasting practices, also serving as a benchmark tool against other \n\nproposed methods. It assumes the next step of the time series has equal \n\nconditions to the present. In the case of solar irradiance forecasting, it is \n\nassumed that the cloud cover remains the same for the next time step. The \n\nformulation for Persistence used in the investigations is represented as:  \n\n \n\n??+1 = ?? =\n??\n\n??\n?????         (12) \n\n \n\nwhere kt+1 is the forecasted clear sky index in the next time step, kt is \nthe value of clear sky index at the present time step, Gt is the value of \nglobal horizontal irradiance and Gt\n\nclear  is the value of the clear sky \n\nirradiance, both at present. The Persistence forecast value for the global \n\nhorizontal irradiance, Gt+1, is then completed as: \n \n\n??+1 = ?? ??+1\n?????          (13) \n\n \n\nwith the clear sky index kt  in the present multiplied by the clear sky \nirradiance value at the next time step (Gt+1\n\nclear). As per objectives of the \n\nthesis, the investigatory focus lies on short-term applications. Thus, the \n\nforecast horizons used equal to 15-min, 30-min (matching the trading \n\ninterval for electricity in Singapore) and 1-hr. \n\n \n\n[2] Auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) \n\nThis forecast is performed on the univariate time series of clear sky \n\nindices. Each forecast step fits a new ARIMA or ETS model (see method \n\n[3]), and then makes a one-step ahead forecast t + 1 based on the fitted \nmodel. \n\nThe univariate ARIMA uses the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm \n\nfor automatic modeling (HYNDMAN and KHANDAKAR, 2008), where \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n152 \n\nthe best ARIMA model is selected for each forecast step according to \n\nAICc (corrected Akaike information criteria). \n\nThe outline of the algorithm is further described as follows: \n\n \n\n? The number of differences d is found by using repeated KPSS \n(Kwiatkowski\u2013Phillips\u2013Schmidt\u2013Shin) tests; \n\n \n\n? The values of p and q (the autoregressive and moving average \ncomponents of the chosen ARIMA function) are selected by \n\nminimizing the AICc after differencing the data d times. The \nalgorithm applies a stepwise search to traverse the model space \n\ninstead of exploring all the possible combinations of p and q; \no Finding the smallest AICc (namely, the best model) is \n\nachieved by selecting from the following four \n\nconfigurations: ARIMA (2,d,2), ARIMA (0,d,0), \n\nARIMA (1,d,0), ARIMA (0,d,1). If d = 0, the constant \nc  is included; if d ? 1 , the constant c  is set to zero \n(namely, the current model); \n\no Variations on the current model are considered such as \nvarying p  and/or q  by \u00b11 ; and include or exclude c \nfrom the current model. The best model considered so \n\nfar (either the current model, or one of these variations) \n\nbecomes the new current model; \n\no The previous step is repeated until no lower AICc can \nbe found. \n\nPedro and Coimbra in the United States (PEDRO and COIMBRA, \n\n2012), Masa-Bote and Caama\u00f1o-Mart\u00edn in Spain (MASA-BOTE and \n\nCAAMA\u00d1O-MART\u00cdN, 2010), and Dong et al. and Ye at al. in Singapore \n\n(DONG et al., 2013; YANG, D., DONG, Z., et al., 2014), are some of the \nworks in the past years applying variations of ARIMA for solar \n\nforecasting purposes. \n\n \n\n[3] ETS (exponential smoothing state space) model \n\nExponential smoothing state space (commonly abbreviated as \n\nETS) considers time series as a combination of three components, \n\nnamely, the trend (T), the seasonal (S) and the error (E) components. The \n\ntrend component consists of the combination of a level term (l), and a \n\n\n\n \n\n153 \n\ngrowth term (b). When describing the forecast trend Th over the next h \ntime periods, l and b can be combined in the following five ways: \n\n \n\n? None:    ?? = ? \n? Additive:    ?? = ? + ?? \n? Additive damped:   ?? = ? + (? + ?\n\n2 + ? + ??)b \n? Multiplicative:   ?? = ??\n\n? \n\n? Multiplicative damped:  ?? = ??(? + ?\n2 + ? + ??) \n\n \n\nwhere 0 &lt;? &lt;1 is a damping parameter. Besides the trend component, \nthe seasonal components can be additive (T + S), multiplicative (T \u00d7 S) \nor none. This gives rise to the 15 combination of time series components \n\nshown in Table 13 (YANG, SHARMA, et al., 2015).  \n\nTable 13: Possible combination of time series components in an exponential \n\nsmoothing model (YANG, SHARMA, et al., 2015). \n\n \n \n\nSuppose the errors in an exponential smoothing state space model \n\n(which refers to error, trend and seasonal components) can be either \n\nadditive or multiplicative, then there are in total 30 ETS models. \n\nFollowing the framework terminology given in (HYNDMAN et al., \n\n2008), each state space model according to its Error, Trend, Seasonal \n\nconfigurations, respectively, is labeled. For example, ETS (M, N, and N) \n\ncorresponds to simple exponential smoothing with multiplicative errors.  \n\nFor the usage of ETS within this thesis, the models are run without \n\nseasonal component, since the forecast is performed on time series of \n\nclear sky indices. Yang et al. (YANG, SHARMA, et al., 2015) and Dong \n\net al. (DONG et al., 2013) have published articles on solar irradiance \nforecasting using ETS. \n\nThe Persistence forecasting methods, as well as the ARIMA and \n\nETS ones were run in the statistical software \u201cR Studios\u201d. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n154 \n\n[4] Artificial neural networks (ANN) \n\nArtificial neural networks (ANN) were created from the \n\nobservation of neurons as a special type of cell. In most cases, signals are \n\npropagated from neuron to neuron until they reach the desired target \n\n(HAYKIN, 1999). This signal propagation is the basis of an ANN \n\narchitecture, where artificial neurons are arranged in layers along which \n\nthe original input is processed in order to formulate a desirable output.  \n\nA classic example of ANN architecture was shown in Figure 54. \n\nAn input layer takes the original data, which is processed along internal \n\nneuron layers, called hidden layers until a corresponding value is obtained \n\nin an output layer. ANNs are commonly used in classification and \n\nforecasting problems (HAYKIN, 1999). Works by Marquez et al. \n\n(MARQUEZ et al., 2013), Pedro and Coimbra (PEDRO and COIMBRA, \n\n2012), Marquez and Coimbra (MARQUEZ and COIMBRA, 2011), \n\nMellit and Pavan (MELLIT and PAVAN, 2010) and Cao and Cao (CAO, \n\nJ. C. and CAO, S. H., 2006) are examples of ANN applied to solar \n\nirradiation modeling. \n\nMathematically, an ANN can be represented as an equation, which \n\nis composed by functions f(x) , called activation functions. Those \nfunctions compose a weighted sum as shown in Equation 14: \n\n \n\n? = (? ??? ?? (? ??? ???,? ))      (14) \n\n \n\nwhere x is the input vector [x1, x2, \u2026, xn]; f is the activation function, \nused for each neuron in the hidden layer; Wij are elements of the weight \n\nmatrix, which connects input layer to the hidden layer, from ith neuron in \nthe input layer to jth neuron in the hidden layer; and wj is the element of \n\nthe weight vector connecting the hidden layer to the output layer. This \n\nmodel represents an ANN with one hidden layer and a single neuron in \n\nthe output layer. An ANN output is provided by the combination of \n\nweights and activation functions. \n\nFor the experiments with ANN proposed in this thesis, the following \n\nsettings are applied: \n\n \n\n? For 1-hr forecasting horizon, an input layer with 24 neurons: one \nneuron for hour in t  and twenty-three others with irradiance \nvalues observed in steps t ? 23 to t (i.e. information from the \nlast 24-hrs); \n\n\n\n \n\n155 \n\n? For 30-min forecasting horizon, an input layer with 13 neurons: \none neuron for hour in t and twelve others with irradiance values \nobserved in steps t ? 11 to t (i.e. information from the last 6-\nhrs); \n\n? For 15-min forecasting horizon, twenty-four steps were \nconsidered (i.e. also with information from the last 6-hrs); \n\n? A hidden layer with two neurons was utilized; \n\n? An output layer with one neuron represents the target irradiance \nvalue in ? + 1; \n\n? The activation function for the hidden layer is the hyperbolic \ntangent sigmoid, and for the output layer, the linear transfer \n\nfunction is applied; \n\n? The ANN is trained with adaptive gradient descent with \nmomentum training method. \n\n \n\nAll ANN architecture, tests and validations were conducted in the \n\nsoftware \u201cMatlab\u201d. \n\nAs a tropical location, Singapore lacks the typical seasons of the \n\nyear, rather having dry and wet seasons (FONG, 2012). The training \n\nperformed for the ANNs uses past comparable months for the analysis. \n\nFor example, March 2014 data is used for training and March 2015 for \n\nvalidation, thus maximizing on weather similarities among the involved \n\ndatasets. \n\n3.3.2 A Hybrid short-term irradiance forecasting method \n\nFor the works surrounding this thesis, the author studied the \n\nweather in Singapore and how existing forecasting methods behaved at \n\nvarious conditions and their apparent shortfalls. A concept was created \n\nfor a new Hybrid method (method [5] to be tested), which takes into \n\naccount meteorological input data acquired through a network of ground-\n\nmeasuring weather stations deployed by SERIS in Singapore. In the \n\nmethod, the concept of \u201csentries\u201d is adopted, whereby all perimeter \n\nstations of the island work as a \u201cwatchdog\u201d or \u201csentinel\u201d, detecting \n\nvariations of entrance/exit of clouds, rain clouds and any other detectable \n\nmeteorological phenomena of interest (see Figure 75). As inputs, values \nsuch as relative humidity, global horizontal irradiance and air pressure \n\nwere fully utilized. Thus, the locations of the superstations, when \n\nenvisioned, followed this method concept. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n156 \n\n \n\nFigure 75: Map of Singapore presenting the location of the nine \n\nmeteorological stations used in the proposed Hybrid method (NOBRE et al., \n\n2015 (submitted)).  \n\nIn the novel concept, the Persistence and ARIMA forecasting \n\nmethods were combined to obtain irradiance forecasts, together with the \n\nfollowing parameters used to feed the Hybrid algorithm decision tree (as \n\n\u201ctriggers\u201d): global horizontal irradiance (GHI), air pressure, relative \n\nhumidity and clear sky index. Additionally, air pollution readings based \n\non the Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) provided by the National \n\nEnvironment Agency of Singapore (NEA) were also used for the analysis.  \n\n \n\nTrigger #1: Air pressure \n \n\nBased on air pressure readings from stations positioned at the \n\nboundaries of Singapore, it is aimed that early detection of approaching \n\nstorms originating from Malaysia (to the North) and Indonesia (Sumatra \n\nto the West and Borneo to the East), as well as from Southern islands of \n\nSingapore and Indonesia, will lead to enhanced short-term irradiance \n\nforecasts. Although broken clouds do form within the island, the \n\napproximation of storm phenomena, originating outside of Singapore and \n\ntraveling towards it, proves to be an invaluable opportunity for enhanced \n\nsolar irradiance forecasts. \n\nFigure 76 shows the air pressure time series variation between \n\nminute (t) and the previous minute (t \u2013 1). The pressure variation observed \n\nat typical clear sky conditions is shown as red circles (on the top of the \n\n\n\n \n\n157 \n\ngraph). As a comparison, the blue triangles show the air pressure variation \n\nat a station to the West of Singapore for the same day as earlier depicted \n\nin Figure 11 (i.e. during the arrival of a Sumatra squall). Circa 20-min \n\nbefore the actual arrival of the darker and heavier rain clouds (the time \n\ninterval was also validated by ground measurements of irradiance), air \n\npressure varied due to the thicker cloud front pushing the air ahead. \n\nFor the proposed Hybrid method, any triggering of air pressure \n\nvariation at the eight outskirt stations is perceived as the arrival of rain \n\nclouds and is thus associated with a soon-to-happen, sudden reduction of \n\nsolar irradiance. The path of the storm is assumed to be linear, although \n\nsuch extrapolation (as exemplified in Figure 11) is not always the case.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 76: Typical air pressure variation on a 1-min basis for a clear sky day \n\nconditions and during an approaching storm (NOBRE et al., 2015 \n\n(submitted)). \n\n \n\nTrigger #2: Global horizontal irradiance and clear sky index \n \n\nThe clear sky index (kt, defined as the ratio between the measured \n\nglobal horizontal irradiance and the clear sky irradiance computed for the \n\nlocation) can also be used as an additional input parameter to the Hybrid \n\nforecasting model as it is closely related to the cloudiness status of the \n\natmosphere. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n158 \n\nIn order to better understand certain weather phenomena in \n\nSingapore, Figure 77 (top) shows the clear sky indices (based on values \n\nof irradiance on ground level measured against an established clear sky \n\nmodel for the island). This graph is assembled using data for two years \n\n(2013 and 2014) and binned in 1-hour intervals throughout the day (from \n\n9 am to 5 pm, in eight bin classes). This portion of the graph indicates \n\ncloudier afternoons in Singapore, what would be expected for a tropical \n\nlocation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 77: Clear sky indices binned in eight time hourly intervals in the day, \n\nindicating cloudier afternoons versus mornings (top). ARIMA versus \n\nPersistence forecast mean absolute percent errors (MAPEs) plotted against \n\nhourly binning through the day (bottom) (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\nAdditionally, Figure 77 (bottom) shows the ARIMA and \n\nPersistence mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs), also organized per \n\nthe eight bin classes discussed. This graph already indicates a greater \n\nunderperformance of the ARIMA forecast in the afternoon portion of the \n\nday. \n\n\n\n \n\n159 \n\nClear sky conditions are found when the clear sky index is > 0.70, \n\nalthough such days are rare in Singapore. The criterion for overcast \n\nconditions was set for > 0.40 in the investigations, which mostly occurs \n\nin the afternoon. For the Hybrid method here proposed, ARIMA is \n\nselected when the diffuse ratio falls between the 0.40 and 0.70 interval. \n\nBoth upper and lower values of the threshold were arbitrarily selected \n\nbased on observations of the local weather. The interval chosen delivered \n\nsatisfactory performance for the trigger points. Once again, it can be \n\nobserved in Figure 77 (top) that periods in the morning are less cloudy \n\nthan in the afternoon, which is typical for tropical locations where rain \n\nshowers often happen in the middle to late afternoon. \n\n \n\nTrigger #3: Relative humidity \n\n \n\nThe relative humidity data (Hamb) are used as a trigger parameter \n\nto identify the start of the rain storm. The large positive growth rate of \n\nHamb indicates when and where rain showers occur. Additionally, the Hamb \n\ndecreases upon the end of a rainstorm, which assists in the identification \n\nof improving weather conditions ahead. The great majority of storm \n\nevents registered within the two years of data covered in analysis \n\nconducted occurred from the middle to late afternoon, often dissipating \n\nafter sunset. \n\n \n\nTrigger #4: Pollution Standards Index (PSI) \n \n\nThe PSI values, covered in subsection 2.3.3, are also used as one \n\nof the triggers in the Hybrid method. PSI data acquired from NEA is made \n\navailable in 1-hr intervals. For the first step of the algorithm, the PSI \n\nlevels are checked island-wide. For a condition of levels above 100, the \n\nPersistence forecast method is triggered. \n\n \n\nProposed Hybrid short-term forecasting \n \n\nThe proposed Hybrid forecast algorithm, combining the \n\nPersistence and ARIMA methods, uses storm approximation triggers \n\nfrom boundary stations to help forecast irradiance conditions expected at \n\nthe reference station after a certain time lag (validation station \u201cV\u201d in \n\nFigure 75). The series of triggers were set according to pre-determined \n\nmeteorological conditions, dictating the swapping between the two \n\nutilized forecasting methods \u2013 the air pressure sensors are used for storm \n\napproximation detection (e.g. the storm shown in Figure 11), and relative \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n160 \n\nhumidity sensors (for rainfall start, progression and dissipation). In terms \n\nof the air quality monitoring, the hourly PSI readings from the NEA \n\nmeasurement network across Singapore were also directly taken as input \n\nparameters. \n\nIn a nutshell, the forecasting algorithm targets three severe weather \n\nconditions, when it is expected to outperform solo ARIMA or Persistence \n\nforecasts: (1) sudden storms, (2) washouts, and (3) haze episodes. The \n\nproposed Hybrid method is shown in the form of a flow diagram in Figure \n\n78. ARIMA and Persistence codes were run with the software R Studios. \n\nThe Hybrid code was organized and developed under a \u201cLabVIEW\u201d \n\ninterface routine (from National Instruments), for both historical checks, \n\nbut also for a live code which runs at SERIS\u2019 PV System Technology \n\nLaboratory. Only forecasts within the 8-hr window between 9 am and 5 \n\npm are taken into account, as previously discussed under 3.1.2. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 78: Schematic diagram of the proposed Hybrid algorithm for short-\n\nterm irradiance forecasting during severe weather events in Singapore \n\n(NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n\nCase study #1: Sudden storms \n\n \n\nStorms were defined as instances when air pressure sensors \n\nindicated a certain 1-min variation from an arbitrary threshold. The \n\ntrigger fine-tuning was facilitated by the use of Doppler radar images as \n\nshown in Figure 11. Radar images contribute not only to the learning \n\ncurve in adjusting the air pressure trigger threshold, but also for \n\nunderstanding common storm velocities and paths. \n\nAs Singapore possesses tropical climate, the majority of its rain \n\nshowers take place in the afternoon after sufficient thermal exchange has \n\noccurred between the Earth\u2019s surface and the atmosphere. From data \n\nanalysis of a two-year database, the most common timeframe for sudden \n\nstorms was registered within the 2 pm to 4 pm period. Figure 79 shows \n\none of such storms. In this particular example, global horizontal \n\nirradiance (red squares) almost reached 0 W/m2, while relative humidity \n\npresents a fast increase with the arrival of the storm. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 79: Global horizontal irradiance during a variable and a cloudy day. \n\nThe variable day experienced a sudden storm after 15:00, which can be \n\nvisualized by the sharp increase in relative humidity associated with the \n\npresence of rain (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n As highlighted earlier in Figure 47, the main contribution of the \n\nstorm detection system proposed lies on the fact that the Hybrid model \n\nallows avoidance of peak errors inherently present in current time series-\n\nbased forecasting methods such as ARIMA and Persistence, which rely \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n162 \n\non previous irradiance steps data. Using the information of peripheral \n\nground measurements before the arrival of storms at a given point of the \n\nisland allows reduction of prediction errors. \n\n \n\nCase study #2: Washouts \n\n \n\nA washout event occurs when rain showers prevail during the \n\nentire time period of interest, leading to extremely low total irradiation \n\nlevels. For the Hybrid algorithm, a daily irradiation of 1.50 kWh/m2 was \n\narbitrarily set as a threshold below which all days are classified as \n\nwashout days. The average long-term daily irradiation value for \n\nSingapore is 4.47 kWh/m2 (as per subsection 2.3.2), which accounts to an \n\nannual typical meteorological year of 1,631 kWh/m2. A washout day is \n\nalso shown in Figure 80 for comparison purposes against a variable day. \n\nAlthough the figure was assembled to show normalized output of PV \n\nsystems, the maximum GHI throughout Singapore never reached 200 \n\nW/m2 for the entire day, with the relative humidity also never going below \n\n90%. \n\nPV systems in Singapore should perform at an average of 80% \n\nperformance ratio for well-designed systems and 85% for leading-edge \n\ninstallations (KHOO, NOBRE, et al., 2014; NOBRE, YE, et al., 2012). \nDuring peak-hours of solar irradiance, even with cloud-edge and cloud-\n\nenhancement effects, PV systems in Singapore tend to have maximum \n\nAC power outputs of approximately 85-90% of their nameplate \n\ncapacities. Figure 80 shows the normalized AC power output of ten \n\nexisting PV systems of different sizes and technologies located across \n\nSingapore during a so called \u201cwashout\u201d day. The highest value recorded \n\nfor any of the systems was ~10% of the rated nameplate capacity, with \n\nthe average value of the ten systems, shown as a thick black line in Figure \n\n80, reaching only ~6% of an equivalent maximum nameplate installation. \n\nAs a comparison, the normalized AC power output on a typical irradiance \n\nday is shown in the same figure, with an average peak of ~78% just before \n\nnoon. \n\nThe use of the Persistence forecasting method when washout \n\nconditions are identified in Singapore does not necessarily entail the \n\nimprovement of a short-term irradiance forecast. It rather serves as an \n\nindication to stakeholders and other scientists in the field that the use of a \n\nsimple Persistence allows for minimum forecasting errors against other \n\nmore complex methods (such as ARIMA or ANN). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n163 \n\n \n\nFigure 80: Normalized 1-min AC power output from ten existing PV systems \n\nlocated across Singapore representing different sizes and technologies on a \n\n\u201cwashout\u201d day and also on a typical day (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\nCase study #3: Haze periods \n\n \n\nThe topic of haze was covered in detail in subsection 2.3.3., which \n\ncan be summarized by the period when forest fires for agriculture land \n\nclearing, mainly in Indonesia, trigger air pollution events in Singapore. \n\nGenerally, haze episodes occur during the dry season and tend to last for \n\n7-10 days on average, depending on prevailing wind speeds and \n\ndirections. Apart from its influence on the performance of PV systems \n\n(LIU et al., 2014b), the haze situation has a somewhat similar effect on \n\nPV yields as washout days do, whereby short-term irradiance forecasting \n\nprovided by the Persistence method achieves lower or on-par accuracy \n\nagainst more complex methods, such as the ARIMA model. \n\nAs a method step for the Hybrid algorithm, only haze events \n\npresenting PSI larger than 100 were considered. This set point was based \n\non previous studies (LIU et al., 2014b; NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\nFor such conditions, it is common that the diffuse fraction of solar \nirradiance reaches high values, comparable to those in washout events.  \n\nAs mentioned before, the reduction in the forecast uncertainty is likely \n\nbetter accomplished by the use of the Persistence method. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n164 \n\nReadings for PSI levels were obtained via the NEA website (NEA, \n\n2013b). The PSI data reflects a total of six pollutants including total \n\nparticulate matter (PM10) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). PSI data \n\nprovides accurate information on air quality, taking measurements from \n\na network of air monitoring stations located in different areas of \n\nSingapore. \n \n\nValidation \n \n\nA ground measurement site located at the center of Singapore \n\n(station \u201cV\u201d in Figure 75) is used as reference to validate the forecast \n\noutputs provided by the Hybrid model proposed. For the tests of the \n\nmethod, ten days with approaching storms (five from 2013 and five from \n\n2014) were randomly selected among the pool of available stormy days, \n\nten days with washout conditions, and ten days from a strong haze episode \n\nin 2013 and a lighter one in 2014 were also arbitrarily chosen for testing \n\nand validation purposes. The pool of potential case studies was earlier \n\npresented in Table 5. \n\nAs gauge of the benchmarking among various methods, the \n\nnormalized root mean square errors (nRMSE) is calculated for the Hybrid \n\nmethod, as well as for Persistence-only and ARIMA-only using the \n\nvalidation site.   \n\nFor usage of the method at other locations in Singapore other than \n\nthe selected station \u201cV\u201d, it is necessary to gauge whether the chosen site \n\nfalls in central parts of the island \u2013 in which situation the methodology \n\ncould be implemented on a similar basis, with minor adjustments to the \n\ntravel distance for storms. For near coastal areas, the necessary adaptation \n\nof the method lies on the fact that the time gained in detecting an \n\napproaching storm is reduced, thus potentially compromising the results \n\nfor cases of very fast storms. For this reason, the method goes through a \n\nvariation proposed by the author as presented later in section 3.3.4. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n165 \n\n3.3.3 Benchmarking of methods \n\nThe efforts from other early works in irradiance forecasting in \n\nSingapore included stochastic models such as ARIMA, Persistence, \n\nexponential smoothing state space (ETS) and numerical weather \n\nprediction (NWP, via the WRF model) (ARYAPUTERA et al., 2015; \n\nDONG et al., 2014; 2013; YANG, D., DONG, Z., et al., 2014; YANG et \n\nal., 2012; YANG, SHARMA, et al., 2015). \nWithin this thesis, specific case studies are addressed (sudden \n\nstorms, washouts and hazy conditions) in the testing and validation of the \n\nnovel Hybrid method. Apart from those exercises, all five methods \n\ndiscussed in 3.3.1, i.e. [1] Persistence, [2] ARIMA, [3] ETS, [4] ANN, \n\nand the [5] proposed Hybrid (covered in 3.3.2), are tested for a one-year \n\nperiod of data (from April 2014 to March 2015) using the central ground-\n\nmeasuring station \u201cV\u201d (in Figure 75) as validation site. \n\nFor the short-term solar irradiance forecasting investigations, the \n\nnormalized root mean square error (nRMSE) is further used as a figure of \n\nmerit to determine forecast efficacy on a month-by-month basis, see \n\nEquation 15. \n\n \n\n????? = 100%?\n1\n\n?\n? (??? ? ?? )\n\n2?\n?=1      (15) \n\n \n\nwhere Gfc is the forecasted irradiance in ? + 1 time step and Gm is the \nmeasured irradiance also in the future step. \n\nThe forecasting skill \u201cs\u201d is defined to measure the improvement of \n\nthe proposed Hybrid model against the simplistic Persistence method, as \n\na baseline. The value of \u201cs\u201d is calculated by Equation 16.  \n\n \n\n? = 1 ?\n?????\n\n????????????????\n       (16) \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n166 \n\n3.3.4 Expanding the Singapore sensing network \n\nAlthough a proposed novel method is tested for a central location \n\nof the island (validation station \u201cV\u201d in Figure 75), it is desired that other \n\nsites within Singapore do not suffer from large forecasting errors when, \n\nfor example, a sudden storm crosses the perimeter of the country. \n\nTherefore, it is proposed that the existing remote sensing network is \n\nexpanded to include an additional number of six remote stations \u2013 four of \n\nthem in islands surrounding Singapore (Pulau Ubin in the Northeast, \n\nJurong Island in the Southwest, and St. John\u2019s Island &amp; Pulau Semakau \n\nto the South). A fifth and sixth stations at the East and West borders of \n\nSingapore complete the expansion works, at Changi Bay and Tuas \n\nCheckpoint, respectively. See Figure 81 for the six expansion sites (\u201cE\u201d) \n\nand further station details in Table 14. Stations which are still to be \n\ndeployed (\u201cTBD\u201d) by the submission date of this thesis are marked in \n\nitalics. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 81: Existing (as of November 2013) and proposed stations (by end \n\n2015), as well as perimeter belts of superstations (NOBRE et al., 2015 (in \n\npreparation)). \n\nOn top of the new perimeter station additions, the expansion plan \n\nincludes the revamp of basic station #410 into a superstation, thus \n\nallowing for an early warning detection system for the Tuas South \n\nindustrial area (\u201cIndustry 1\u201d). Other major industrial areas are marked in \n\n\n\n \n\n167 \n\nFigure 81, where large manufacturing plants and warehouses provide \n\npremium space for the deployment of PV systems. Furthermore, station \n\n#431 is to be located just outside Tuas Checkpoint (the second link bridge \n\nconnecting Singapore and Malaysia). The presence of this station allows \n\nfor a warning system station for several water catchment reservoirs to the \n\nWest of the island, earmarked for floating systems deployment, having \n\nalready been assessed to potentially host hundreds of MW of PV systems. \n\nTable 14: Basic characteristics of six ground-measuring meteorological \n\nstations for a remote sensing network expansion in Singapore (NOBRE et \n\nal., 2015 (in preparation)). \n\nID \n\n# \n\nStation \n\nName \n\nDistrict in \n\nSingapore \n\nLatitude \n\n[N] \n\nLongitude \n\n[E] \n\nAltitude \n\n[m] \n\nDate \n\nDeployed \n\nE1 426 Changi Bay 1\u00b018\u201957\u201d 104\u00b000\u201955\u201d 12 May/15 \n\nE2 427 St. John\u2019s Isl. 1\u00b013\u201904\u201d 103\u00b050\u201958\u201d  27 Jun/15 \nE3 428 Pulau Ubin 1\u00b024\u201912\u201d 103\u00b058\u201909\u201d  9 TBD \n\nE4 429 Pulau Semakau 1\u00b012\u201903\u201d 103\u00b046\u201950\u201d  5 TBD \n\nE5 430 Jurong Island 1\u00b013\u201951\u201d 103\u00b040\u201945\u201d 15 TBD \n\nE6 431 Tuas Checkpoint 1\u00b020\u201955\u201d 103\u00b038\u201916\u201d 8 TBD \n\n \n\nThe smaller perimeter belt shown in Figure 81 (in brown), takes \n\ninto account the most outward stations of the network possessing \n\nsuperstations (as of the completion of the original network in November \n\n2013). It encompasses an area of roughly 500 km2, covering most of the \n\ncountry\u2019s highly populated areas (made up by Housing &amp; Development \n\nBoard buildings, also known as \u201cHDBs\u201d, which host ~40% of all PV \n\nsystems in Singapore to date, with further plans for expansion). \n\nAlthough the majority of the areas outside of this perimeter are \n\nmilitary training zones or heavy industry-specific areas (such as oil \n\nrefineries in Jurong Island, \u201cIndustry 3\u201d), the available number of \n\nindustrial rooftops to the Southwest- (\u201cIndustry 2\u201d) and East-ends \n\n(\u201cIndustry 4\u201d) of Singapore, added with the fresh water reservoirs on the \n\nedges of the West part of the island, make the extension of the network a \n\ndesired research sub-product. The proposed expanded perimeter belt (in \n\nyellow) encompasses an area of ~800 km2, 60% more than the original \n\nnetwork, and likely to contain the great majority of bigger volume PV \n\nsystems in the country in a foreseeable future. \n\nThis portion of the method promoted the expansion of the network \n\nand allowed for the demonstration that outward stations indeed can help \n\nwith short-term forecasting enhancements for PV systems located outside \n\nof the original belt of meteorological stations.   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n168 \n\n3.3.5 Sky imagery as short-term forecasting support tool \n\nAs presented in 2.4.5, sky imagery utilization has been previously \n\nused as means of forecasting solar irradiance. Due to cloud motion \n\nphysics, the technique is highly suitable for short-term applications, as \n\nclouds within the field of vision of the camera take a few minutes to enter, \n\ncross and exit the image. For this reason, the deployment of fish-eye lens \n\nsky cameras in Singapore was promoted, with the network shown in \n\nFigure 56 containing thirteen cameras as an outcome of the efforts \n\npromoted within this thesis. \n\nIn the publications cited, usually cloud height or speed are studied, \n\nso that it can be estimated where clouds are headed and their dynamics. \n\nVia a paper by Yang et al. (YANG, WALSH, et al., 2013), block \nmatching algorithms (BMAs) were explored in creating motion vectors \n\ndescribing changes in the irradiance conditions on a 2D map of Singapore. \n\nThe work further introduced the use of BMAs for cloud-contour tracking, \n\nby comparing two images in ? ? 1 and ?. To avoid problems of mapping \nof the many resulting vectors of the image, a grouping of five points was \n\nproposed, which are then seen as red small motion vectors in Figure 82. \n\nThe orientation of the vector shows the resulting direction, with the length \n\nof the vector proportional to the speed of motion of the cloud segment.  \n\nFigure 82 shows three sky images taken in 1-min intervals, with \n\nthe vector fields created between images one and two, and then between \n\nimages two and three, shown at the bottom of the figure. A further \n\nenhancement promoted by the author of this thesis to the concept first \n\nproposed by Yang et al. was the creation of a resultant vector (shown in \n\nblue in the figure) which is a representation of the predominant cloud \n\ngroup direction of motion for the entire image, with the length of the \n\nvector also representing the traveling progression of the cloud grouping. \n\nPrecise determination of cloud speeds and their height go beyond the \n\nscope of works included in this thesis. \n\nIn typical days, irradiance levels in Singapore can vary \n\ndramatically as earlier shown in Figure 26 and Figure 46. For such days, \n\nit is expected that cloud vectoring, based primarily on broken clouds, \n\nlikely yields irregular cloud speeds and directions throughout the island, \n\nthus making it difficult for their use in the forecasting products. However, \n\nit is proposed that minutely vector creation for the deployed cameras will \n\nassist wind direction gauging, which in turn have two uses: a) \n\ndetermination of predominant wind directions across Singapore, with \n\nsimilar vectors throughout the island likely indicating major cloud events \n\n(e.g. storms) approaching or progressing through the island, and b) assist \n\n\n\n \n\n169 \n\nhaze episode arrival, development and dissipation, as air pollution is \n\nhighly correlated to prevailing wind conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 82: Example sequence of three sky images and associated output \n\ncloud motion vectors (NOBRE et al., 2015 (in preparation)). \n\nFinally, with a hybrid investigation containing irradiance drop at \n\nstations in a sequence, together with cloud vectoring, and Doppler radar \n\nassistance, approaching and developing storm directions are investigated \n\nto act as a support tool to other forecasting methods. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n170 \n\n3.4 METHODS FOR PV SYSTEM POWER CONVERSION \n\n3.4.1 Single system modeling opening remarks \n\nWhen developing and performing new solar irradiance forecasting \n\nmethods, it is aimed that deviations between measured and predicted \n\nvalues progressively decrease towards an \u201cunattainable no-error\u201d \n\ncondition. When launching a novel algorithm such as the one discussed \n\nin 3.3.2, the main intent is to prove its higher accuracy versus previously \n\ndeployed methods. It is often the case in the relatively new field of solar \n\nirradiance forecasting that constant, but gradual improvements are made. \n\nAs a consequence of the efforts invested in reducing forecasting errors, it \n\nis hoped that such improvements are not achieved in vain, when \n\nperforming power generation estimations for PV systems, in a future \n\ndominated by a vast amount of these renewable energy sources. A coarse \n\nimplementation of PV simulation or up-scaling routines might wipe out \n\nany improvements achieved from forecast algorithms. \n\nIn subsection 2.6.2, formulation for PV system modeling was \n\nintroduced. When using the equations presented, Figure 83 summarizes \n\nthe efficacy of the model, here for a PV system in Singapore and at a \n\ncondition of low wind speeds.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 83: Simulated versus measured AC power output of a PV system in \n\nSingapore under low wind speeds (source: SERIS). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n171 \n\n \n\nFigure 83 plots the minutely AC energy output values simulated \n\nfor a single day, with the model using measured in-plane irradiance from \n\na calibrated silicon sensor on site. It is contrasted by the actual measured \n\nAC power output read from an AC meter at the output of a PV inverter. \n\nFor this particular example, the fit of the two curves is within 0.5% of \n\nerror, which highlights the good fit of the formulation, but also the quality \n\nof this particular system presented (as it is later presented in 3.4.2). This \n\nwas addressed in section 2.5, whereby an accurate PV system power \n\noutput modeling depends on several factors, like the age of the system as \n\nan example (e.g. smaller simulation errors for systems which have yet to \n\nsuffer major degradation effects), among other influences, which are \n\ndiscussed within section 3.4. \n\nAs PV systems performance in warm climates are concerned \n\n(covered in 2.5.4), understanding how systems behave in such locations \n\nplays a crucial role in power conversion forecasting and error curtailment. \n\nFor that reason, and as yet another example, special attention should be \n\ngiven to the estimation of module temperature based on system mounting \n\nconditions, which could account for an almost 3-fold temperature \n\nvariation between sites in a tropical climate, see Figure 84 (YE et al., \n2013). Subsection 3.4.2 covers how error minimization is intended within \n\nthe investigations of this thesis. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 84: Seven categories presented for module temperature variation in \n\nSingapore (YE et al., 2013). Utilization for the method was further validated \n\nfor PV systems in Brazil (NOBRE, MONTENEGRO, et al., 2012). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n172 \n\n3.4.2 Factors heavily influencing PV system modeling \n\nFrom the list of factors influencing PV modeling described in \n\nsection 2.5.2 and 2.5.3, this thesis addressed the following five strong \n\ncontributors: a) PV system modeling, b) temperature losses, c) shading \n\ninfluences, d) long-term degradation and e) irradiance availability due to \n\nair pollution levels. Various case studies presented allowed the gauging \n\nof simulation efficacy for the power conversion in the tropical \n\nenvironment of Singapore. \n\n \n\n[A] System modeling \n\nWell-known formulae as per Equations 9-11 are implemented as a \n\nvalidation tool for systems in a tropical environment. First, it is assumed \n\nonly global horizontal irradiances and ambient temperatures are known. \n\nFor Equation 11, a typical concrete rooftop value of ? = 0.023 \u00b0Cm2W-1 \n\nis used, as per (YE et al., 2013). Secondly, for a better validation against \nreal-field operations, the model with known in-plane irradiance and \n\nmodule temperature parameters is tested, thanks to the network of PV \n\nsystems deployed in the country as previously described in 3.2.2. Finally, \n\na simplistic method using a fixed value of performance ratio (0.80 as \n\ncommonly used by system integrators in Southeast Asia) is tested using \n\ndata for a then new PV system; \n\n[B] Temperature losses \n\nSimulation of power output for a PV system (\u201csystem 1\u201d) is made \n\ntaking into consideration a common mounting system loss factor for \n\nSingapore (? = 0.023 \u00b0Cm2W-1), as shown in a) above and binned as the \n\nslope P3 in Figure 84. The system simulation is then tested taking into \n\naccount that the validation system (\u201csystem 2\u201d) is in fact mounted on a \n\nmetal rooftop, thus experiencing hotter module temperatures (binned as \n\nthe slope P6 in Figure 84). Such systems are commonly found in \n\nSingapore (e.g. on factory/warehouse rooftops, see Figure 13, as well as \n\nprivate houses, see Figure 12, as examples). System 2 of the analysis has \n\nsimilar age and is located ~2 km from system 1, thus experiencing nearly \n\nidentical weather conditions; \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n173 \n\n[C] Shading influences \n\nTwo PV system sections on the same building complex (a hospital \n\nin Singapore, see Figure 85) are used for demonstration on how shading \n\ncould negatively affect power forecasting. Shaded and unshaded systems \n\nare contrasted in the analysis. This system was the last installation added \n\nto the network of sites under research-grade monitoring (system #115 in \n\nTable 11). \n\n \n\nFigure 85: Hospital complex in Singapore, home of four PV system sections \n\n(A, B, C and D), three of which are unshaded (A, B and C). The glass-glass \n\ncanopy PV system in section D is heavily shaded by the surrounding hospital \n\nwings (source: SERIS, adapted for this thesis). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n174 \n\n[D] Long-term degradation \n\nPV system power outputs at a given site, but with readings that are \n\nfive years apart, were shown to highlight the critical influence that aging \n\nhas on simulation and power forecasting. In Figure 86, aging is \n\nshowcased by contrasting a high performing system (with a performance \n\nratio decay of -0.5% per annum) versus a system which operated well for \n\nits first two years of life but later suffered from severe soiling \n\naccumulation due to a construction site nearby, without going through a \n\ncomplete cleaning routine since then (here PR decay of -3.3% p.a.). \n\n \n\nFigure 86: Daily performance ratios of a high performing PV system (left) \n\nand of a poorly maintained one (right), with estimated degradation rates \n\nafter several years of operations of -0.5% and -3.3% per annum (NOBRE et \n\nal., 2015 (in preparation)). \n\n[E] Irradiance availability due to air pollution \n\nComparisons on PV system power output were made between a \n\nclear sky day with low air pollution levels against hazy skies which took \n\nplace in June 2013 (similar period as shown in (LIU et al., 2014b) and \n\naddressed throughout this thesis in other works by the author). \n\nData used for the exercises [A] through [E] stem from a variety of \n\nsystems within the portfolio described in Table 11. The data periods used \n\nin the investigations depend on the challenge at hand. For example, to \n\ndemonstrate degradation influences, analyses from datasets five years \n\napart are used, thus highlighting system output baseline differences \n\nbetween a newly system deployed (in this case back in 2010) versus half-\n\ndecade later (i.e. in 2015). \nIt is proposed that a generic formulation for PV power conversion \n\nis achieved within the thesis, which is then applied for alternative \n\nvalidations, such as up-scaling routines discussed in 3.4.4. \n\n\n\n \n\n175 \n\n3.4.3 Modeling influences due to haze \n\nIn Figure 62, when discussing other factors that influence PV \n\nsystems performance, it was seen how hazy conditions in Singapore \n\nclearly affected the yield of PV systems in June 2013. Quantifying such \n\nimpact, and even estimating economic implications from it, are areas of \n\ninterest for governments and policy makers, as argumentation builds up \n\nwhen air pollution occurs whether it was caused by neighboring countries. \n\nWithin this thesis, the impact of haze on the power output of solar \n\nphotovoltaic (PV) systems in Singapore was also investigated, with the \n\ngoal of understanding implications to PV power conversion routines, to \n\ngauge implications to forecasting activities and to address considerations \n\nfor a future where solar could contribute ~20% of the total electricity \n\ndemand for the country. \n\nIt is trivial to realize that the presence of haze will generate loss of \n\nsolar irradiance reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. However, gauging the \n\neffects is a more difficult task. Although diminishing levels of \n\nillumination on the ground are obvious when air pollution is high (as \n\nshown in Figure 62), one must be able to differentiate between the \n\nreductions in irradiance caused by haze or caused by clouds, or by a \n\ncombination of both. Furthermore, haze not only has an impact on the \n\nlight intensity (which affects the electric current), but also on the PV \n\nmodule temperature (which affects the voltage). In this thesis, a novel \n\nfiltering technique was proposed to eliminate cloud effects, thus allowing \n\nthe gauging of the full impact of the haze alone. As discussed in section \n\n2.3.3, although other air pollution sources do exist in Singapore, such as \n\ncaused by refineries and the country\u2019s car fleet, the investigations \n\nconducted in this thesis are exclusively associated with a haze episode \n\ntriggered by forest fires well documented in the Southeast Asia region \n\nduring June 2013. \n\nA clear sky day was also determined as a baseline for Singapore, \n\nand compared against increasing air pollution conditions. Finally, an \n\nanalysis of ten existing PV systems\u2019 operational behavior in Singapore \n\n(five of crystalline wafer-based and five of thin-film technologies) was \n\nconducted. \n\nIn order to observe the reduction of irradiation at ground level for \n\npolluted days as a function of PSI levels (PSI values above 50, with the \n\ndescriptor \u201cgood\u201d), a first necessary step is to determine a baseline \n\nsituation, which are the irradiance conditions on a clear sky day without \n\nhaze (PSI &lt;50). Due to rapidly changing weather conditions and various \n\nlayers of clouds, clear sky days in tropical locations are rare. Therefore, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n176 \n\nit is not really feasible to obtain the baseline days by measurement records \n\nalone. Instead, such days are best derived from measured data on non-\n\nclear sky days using statistical methods. \n\nThe main task of the presented method is to separately quantify \n\nand eliminate variability caused by haze, clouds or high moisture levels \n\nin the air. In this portion of the thesis, it is proposed the use of three filters \n\nfor the elimination of cloudy or near-cloudy conditions during specific \n\nPSI conditions. That is achieved by performing a sampling analysis on \n\nirradiances recorded at the SERIS meteorological station using a \n\ncalibrated pyranometer. These filters are described and demonstrated in \n\nthe following paragraphs. \n\nIn Figure 87, Filter #1 (\u201cHumidity Filter\u201d, top row graphs) is used \n\nto eliminate events when the relative humidity is above 80%. This way, \n\nrainy conditions or pre/post rain periods, where clouds are present, are \n\ndiscarded. The selection of the value threshold was obtained from \n\nexperience and long-term weather observations. Red triangles throughout \n\nFigure 87 represent eliminated points at the given filter step, while blue \n\ncircles have passed the respective criterion. Three days with sunny, rainy \n\nand intermediate characteristics are shown to illustrate the performance \n\nof the filters. \n\nNext, Filter #2 (\u201cDiffuse Irradiance Fraction Filter\u201d, shown in \n\nFigure 87, middle row graphs) is implemented on all points that have \n\npassed the previous step. The diffuse irradiance fraction is defined as the \n\nratio between measured diffuse horizontal irradiance and the global \n\nhorizontal irradiance. The filter works as a mechanism to remove \n\nsituations with high cloud cover, however no rain. The threshold set was \n\n0.50, with data points being eliminated when ratios are above the selected \n\nvalue. Surviving points are shown in blue circles, while red triangles \n\nrepresent the eliminated points at the current filter. Black crosses are those \n\npoints eliminated in the previous Filter #1 step. \n\nFilter #3 (\u201cClear Sky Irradiance Band Filter\u201d, seen in Figure 87, \n\nbottom row graphs) is the last step of the irradiance loss analysis, which \n\nensures that the targeted data for the clear sky conditions are within \u00b1100 \n\nW/m2 irradiance of the modeled clear sky values. The clear sky irradiance \n\nmodel utilized in this study was adopted from reference (YANG, D., \n\nWALSH, W. M., et al., 2014). Filter #3 works to remove situations of \n\neither cloud-edge/cloud-enhancement effects when irradiance tends to be \n\nhigher due to either reflected light between the ground and the base of \n\nclouds, followed by reflections back at irradiance measurement devices, \n\nor enhanced by a thin layer of clouds (see Figure 41). Also, it assists in \n\n\n\n \n\n177 \n\nthe elimination of points which were not removed within the robustness \n\nof Filter #2 (e.g. a point where the diffuse irradiance fraction might have \n\nbeen 0.48, yet clearly outside of the range expected for a clear sky \n\ncondition, with values for irradiance lower than expected). The selection \n\nof the arbitrary value of 100 W/m2 was based on finding a set point which \n\nwould not cause the elimination of an excessive number of points from \n\nthe analysis, yet strict enough to remove values obviously outside of the \n\nexpected clear sky range. Points outside of the \u00b1100 W/m2 clear sky \n\nirradiance band are shown as red triangles in the final filter step graphs, \n\nwith removed points from Filter #2 marked as orange asterisks. Black \n\ncrosses are those points eliminated in the previous Filter #1 step. \n\nIn order to avoid variations of the daily irradiance profiles \n\nthroughout the year due to the position of the sun in the sky (with varying \n\nzenith and altitude angles), only data points from the June months from \n\n2010 to 2013 were used in the analysis (N.B. June 2013 was the month of \n\nthe major haze event reported). Data are taken from the SERIS \n\nmeteorological station, which started operations in May 2010, thus a total \n\nof 120 June calendar days were available and used for the analysis, also \n\nto reduce the impact of the year-on-year variability of the irradiance due \n\nto the position of the sun in the sky. One-minute global horizontal \n\nirradiance averages were used for the assessment based on readings of a \n\npyranometer. The data points are combined forming a so-called \u201caverage \n\nsolar irradiance day\u201d for the month of June for the given air pollution \n\nconditions. The analysis is further expanded to include readings \n\noriginating also from a calibrated crystalline silicon sensor (which has a \n\nnarrower spectral response range than a pyranometer). \n\n24-hour PSI averages were used for the selection and \n\ncategorization of the available June days. Days were separated into four \n\narbitrary categories: a) PSI ? 50, b) 50 &lt;PSI ? 75, c) 75 &lt;PSI ? 100, and \n\nd) PSI > 100 in an attempt to gauge the loss of irradiation with increasing \n\nlevels of air pollution. Days within the same PSI binning were processed \n\nthrough the filters and averaged together for every one-minute step of \n\nirradiance values. PSI data from a NEA station nearby to the SERIS \n\nmeteorological station was used as provider of the air pollution readings. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n178 \n\n \n\nFigure 87: Demonstration of the performance of three filters in three types \n\nof days (sunny, rainy and cloudy conditions) to derive the progressive sky \n\nconditions for the haze evaluation (NOBRE et al., 2015 (accepted)). \n\nAfter assessing reduction of irradiation on ground level at a single \n\npoint at the SERIS meteorological station, an assessment and \n\nbenchmarking is proposed for the power output of ten PV systems in \n\noperation in Singapore through the same time period of the analysis for \n\ntheir clear sky day behavior, using in-plane irradiance sensors. \n\nAdditionally, an assessment of haze influence to these systems\u2019 \n\nperformance metrics was conducted, taking yield (in kWh per kWp per \nday) and performance ratio (PR) as key indices for the comparison. The \n\nextraordinary day when a hazy but cloudless day occurred (24th June \n\n2013, previously graphed in Figure 62) was used for benchmarking. For \n\na more diverse comparison, both crystalline silicon wafer-based and thin-\n\nfilm technology based PV systems were evaluated.  \n\n\n\n \n\n179 \n\n3.4.4 Country-wide up-scaling routines \n\nByproducts of irradiance forecasts in a future of massive PV \n\ndevelopment will be estimations of the amount of photovoltaic power \n\ndelivered to the grid in a large area of interest, e.g. a city, where thousands \n\nof solar installations are present. When PV systems are improperly \n\nmodeled, either as a single unit or as a fleet, irradiance forecasting errors \n\nare further compounded, making PV power predictions less robust. \n\nThanks to daily available power output records of PV systems from \n\nthe National Solar Repository (discussed in 2.5.5), day-by-day simulation \n\nexercises are made possible for the suggested method here presented for \n\nan up-scaling routine for Singapore. \n\nIn this regard, ten PV systems (accounting for ~10% of the volume \n\nof installations in Singapore as of end of 2014) were selected for \n\nvalidation of the proposed up-scaling method. These systems are shown \n\nin Table 15 with their basic characteristics needed for the exercises. The \n\nselection of these systems was based on amassing a variety of system \n\nsizes, with different roof types, ages and scattered across Singapore. \n\nTable 15: PV systems basic characteristics used in the detailed up-scaling \n\nexercises.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \n\n4.1 SHORT-TERM FORECASTING RESULTS \n\n4.1.1 Novel short-term forecasting method findings \n\nThe investigation on short-term forecasting using the described \n\nHybrid method in 3.3.2 was first presented as a concept of using boundary \n\nmeteorological stations in Singapore in an \u201calarm detection system\u201d for \n\napproaching storms, which in turn helped reduce forecasting errors in a \n\ntropical location like Singapore (NOBRE, SEVERIANO_JR., et al., \n\n2014). In more recent investigations on the topic, two other extreme \n\nweather phenomena were added to the analysis \u2013 \u201cwashout days\u201d (days \n\nwith extreme rain events) and also \u201chazy days\u201d (where air pollution was \n\nconsiderably high). The work was also further expanded with the addition \n\nof data from 2014, together with the previously presented 2013 case \n\nstudies in order to further strengthen the applicability and robustness of \n\nthe envisioned method. \n\nAs described in 3.3.2, ten random days, among the portfolio of \n\nstormy days, were selected for the evaluation of the algorithm. The \n\nfindings for the first case study analysis are summarized in Table 16. It \n\nshows results for the ten selected \u201csudden storm\u201d days. The proposed \n\nHybrid method achieved performance improvements of ~10% in absolute \n\nterms if compared with the Persistence method as a forecasting baseline. \n\nAlso noticeable is the fact that ARIMA underperformed against the \n\nPersistence model for days with extreme weather conditions. This can be \n\nexplained by the classical storm duration in Singapore starting in mid- or \n\nlate afternoon, with dissipation near sunset or shortly after it. This allows \n\nthe Persistence forecast to thrive, which is one of the reasons for this \n\nmethod being chosen as an algorithm of choice for the Hybrid model after \n\na storm has reached the validation station. \n\nAn example of the better performance of the Hybrid method is \n\nshown in Figure 88 (top), with the forecasted irradiance (black dash line) \n\nfollowing the measured irradiance (green continuous line) thanks to an \n\nearlier-detected approaching storm. The minimization of the forecast \n\nerror can also be visualized in Figure 88 (bottom), where ARIMA and \n\nPersistence forecasts demonstrated their known under-performances due \n\nto their reliance on past irradiance step information. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n182 \n\nTable 16: Sudden storm forecasting error improvement when using the \n\nnovel Hybrid method (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 88: Measured GHI at a central site in Singapore, with the forward \n\nARIMA, Persistence and proposed Hybrid 15-min forecasts (top). The \n\nMAPE is given, showing considerable error spikes upon the arrival of the \n\nstorm for both Persistence and ARIMA methods, but not for the proposed \n\nHybrid model (bottom) (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n183 \n\nResults for the second case study addressing ten random washout \n\nevents are presented in Table 17, including the total daily irradiation, as \n\nwell as the nRMSEs obtained by using the Persistence-only and ARIMA-\n\nonly forecast methods. In such example data, the Persistence forecast \n\nvastly outperformed ARIMA, which would be expected for a situation of \n\ntotal cloud cover condition (very low kt values), which suits Persistence. \n\nThe error avoidance column aims at highlighting detrimental errors for \n\nnon-adaptive short-term forecasting models, which rely on running a \n\nsingle algorithm throughout all daily and yearly conditions. \n\nTable 17: Case study on washout conditions in Singapore and error \n\navoidance by selection of the Persistence method over ARIMA (NOBRE et \n\nal., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n \n\nFinally, the third set of case studies is aimed at simplifying short-\n\nterm irradiance forecasting during strong haze episodes, acting similarly \n\nto the washout events. The PSI threshold criterion of 100 was easily \n\ncrossed in 2013, when Singapore experienced a notorious haze season, \n\nreaching unhealthy air quality levels for several days. In 2014, the number \n\nof occurrences of haze days was lower. \n\nTable 18 shows the results of Persistence-only versus ARIMA-\n\nonly forecasts. The error avoidance metric did not indicate much lower \n\nvalues for the hazy, as they were for the washout days (with the use of \nPersistence), but indicated nevertheless that future short-term forecasting \n\nmethods may as well use the more simplistic Persistence forecast during \n\nsuch air pollution events. In any case, it is important to remember that \n\nhaze comes associated with loss of irradiation at ground level. Thus, a \n\nlimitation in the maximum output of PV systems must be accounted for, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n184 \n\nalso when modeling its grid integration impact due to the energy \n\ngeneration shortfall expected. \n\nTable 18: Case study on hazy days in Singapore and error avoidance by \n\nselection of the Persistence method over ARIMA (NOBRE et al., 2015 \n\n(submitted)). \n\n \n \n\nThe novelty of the proposed method lies on the prediction of \n\nmassive drops in irradiance (i.e. consequently power output of PV \n\ninstallations) caused by approaching storms approximately 15-30 minutes \n\nin advance \u2013 which is typically sufficient to ramp-up conventional \n\ngeneration capacities (in Singapore, gas-fired turbines). Furthermore, the \n\nsensor network allows the identification of washout conditions before \n\nsunrise, allowing the grid operator to also react in advance and \n\ncompensate for the missing solar power in such days. \n\nMost cloud motion tends to come from the West parts of Singapore \n\n(thus coming from Sumatra in Indonesia, as per example animation of the \n\nSumatra squall in Figure 11). The caveat: it is expected that there is a \n\ntendency for better forecasts for the Eastern parts of the island as most \n\ncloud activity for Singapore initiates from the West. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n185 \n\n4.1.2 Benchmarking of various forecasting methods \n\nThe novel Hybrid forecasting method fared better than the use of \n\nexisting techniques for a 15-min forecasting interval window. The \n\nfollowing tables highlight the month-by-month results for the five tested \n\nmethods proposed in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, using three prediction horizons (15-\n\nmin, 30-min and 1-hr), as discussed throughout this thesis. \n\nTable 19 presents the short-term irradiance forecast results for an \n\nensemble of five types of forecast methods for 15-min prediction \n\nintervals. The average monthly normalized root mean square errors \n\n(nRMSEs) are based on a central meteorological station in Singapore \n\n(station \u201cV\u201d in Figure 75) as validation site. In bold are lowest average \n\nerrors among the tested forecasts within a particular month. In italics, the \n\naverage one-year errors per forecast type are also shown. The month-by-\n\nmonth average total daily irradiation is also presented for the same \n\nvalidation station, with the highest irradiation month shown in red and the \n\nlowest in blue.  \n\nTable 19: Average monthly 15-min normalized root mean square errors \n\n(nRMSEs) for five short-term solar irradiance forecasting methods for a \n\ncentrally located weather station in Singapore (NOBRE et al., 2015 \n\n(submitted)). \n\n \n \n\nThe proposed Hybrid method achieved the lowest annual average \n\nnRMSE (29.0%), followed by ARIMA (30.0%). It can also be seen that \n\nthe month with the highest levels of irradiation (September 2014, with an \nequivalent average total daily irradiation of 4.90 kWh/m2) produced the \n\nlowest errors, whereas December 2014 had the highest errors in the study \n\n(December is one of the wettest monsoon months, with 2014 having had \n\nan equivalent average total daily irradiation of only 3.45 kWh/m2). Even \n\nthough conditions of total cloud coverage (\u201cwashout\u201d days) could bring \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n186 \n\ndown absolute daily forecasting errors, these months are still \n\ncharacterized by many sudden storm conditions, thus leading to higher \n\nerror values for the entire month. \n\nTaking a 30-min forecasting horizon into account (see Table 20), \n\nthe Hybrid model also displayed the lowest nRMSEs at 30.7% for the \n\nentire period of study among the five studied methods. For the 30-min \n\ntests, the Persistence forecast was the model with the second lowest errors \n\nat 32.3%. In February 2015, Persistence even slightly outperformed the \n\nHybrid forecast.  \n\nTable 20: Average monthly 30-min normalized root mean square errors \n\n(nRMSEs) for five short-term solar irradiance forecasting methods for a \n\ncentrally located weather station in Singapore (NOBRE et al., 2015 \n\n(submitted)). \n\n \n \n\nTable 21 presents the month-by-month improvement of the Hybrid \n\nmodel over the Persistence in absolute percentage points on the RMSE \n\nand also as per metric \u201cs\u201d shown in Equation 16 for the months under \n\nevaluation. A \u201cs\u201d value of zero equals a certain forecast method is as \n\neffective as the Persistence method.  \n\nTaking sunny and cloudy conditions into account, for the months \n\nof September and December 2014, respectively, Figure 89 highlights the \n\nmean average percentage errors (MAPEs) of the ARIMA forecasts for a \n\n15-min horizon window for the studied months. As expected, for the \n\nsunny month, with clearer skies and less storms present, the majority of \n\nthe forecasting errors occurred at low values, which conversely peaks for \n\nthe cloudy month, where 20% occurrences of the MAPE values took place \n\nabove 50% of error (versus 6-7% occurrences for the sunny month). \n\nApproaching storms tend to generate large deviations in the forecasts, \n\nwith prediction errors greater than 100% in certain cases, which naturally \n\n\n\n \n\n187 \n\nis an area of concern to grid operators. As shown earlier in Figure 88, one \n\nof the goals of the Hybrid model had been to curtail large errors at \n\ninstances of approaching storms, something that the ARIMA and \n\nPersistence models fail to do.  \n\nTable 21: Improvement of the proposed Hybrid method versus the \n\nPersistence method (as baseline) on a month-by-month basis, using both \n\nabsolute errors percentage improvement but also the performance metric \n\n\u201cs\u201d (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 89: Mean average percentage errors (MAPE) for ARIMA 15-min \n\nforecasts for a sunny and a cloudy month (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n188 \n\nFinally, the average monthly, 1-hr forecast horizon, normalized \n\nroot mean square errors are shown in Table 22.  \n\nTable 22: Average monthly 1-hr normalized root mean square errors \n\n(nRMSEs) for five solar irradiance forecasting methods for a central \n\nweather station in Singapore (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n \n\nHere, the proposed Hybrid still outperformed the Persistence \n\nmethod (by ~1% in absolute nRMSE terms), however, an ANN \n\nconsiderably reduced errors in a longer horizon setting. This could be \n\nexplained by the fact that once storms arrive in Singapore, they tend to \n\nmove very fast through the island. This means the irradiance smoothing \n\neffect in 1-hr average terms reduces the storm\u2019s \u201cirradiance drop\u201d impact. \n\nExplaining differently: the Hybrid method promotes reduction of errors \n\nin one/two forecast windows after storm arrival. When 1-hr averages are \n\nused, the Hybrid code does not contribute much to error reduction since \n\nthe peaks of irradiation variation are smoothened out throughout the \n\ntwo/four forecast windows, for 15-/30-min, respectively, within a 1-hr \n\ntime step. \n\nNotwithstanding the better performance of ANNs in a 1-hr setting, \n\nthe Hybrid algorithm still proved to be efficient in a short-term setting, \n\nespecially for the same energy trading interval in Singapore (i.e. 30-min). \n\nAs presented in previous sections, rain cloud motion in Singapore \n\ncould present challenging conditions for irradiance modeling and \n\nforecasting in the relatively small area of interest. In order to achieve a \n\ngood accuracy for short-term forecast horizons, time horizon \ninvestigations as well as station-pairing relationships are crucial. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n189 \n\n4.1.3 Case study when extending the sensing network \n\nIn subsection 3.3.4, it was proposed that six new ground-measuring \n\nmeteorological stations are deployed at strategic positions, even farther \n\nthan existing sites and towards the outside contours of Singapore. Two of \n\nsuch stations were deployed as the start point of the expansion works. \n\nThey allow in a first stage the demonstration of the intent of the extension \n\ninitiative and justifications to such an investment. \n\n Figure 90 is a Doppler image registered on the 30th May 2015 when \n\na storm approached Singapore from its East-Southeast border. Under the \n\nformer network perimeter of meteorological stations, delineated by the \n\nbrown belt superimposed onto Figure 90, station #405 is the first \u201cline of \n\ndefense\u201d in detecting changing weather conditions. GHI declined on that \n\nday to 100 W/m2 at 14:50. The new station in #426, on the other hand, \n\nalready had diminishing GHI values at 14:30, 20-min before lowering \n\nlevels at station #405. Additionally, at 14:20, the air pressure trigger in \n\n#426 had already detected the approaching storm, which straight-forward \n\nhelps forecasting efforts ahead at the particular station. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 90: Approaching storm originating from E-SE on 30th May 2015, first \n\ncaptured by new expansion station #426 at Changi Bay (NOBRE et al., 2015 \n\n(in preparation)). \n\n As a reference, station #426 is ~7 km apart from its nearest station \n\nat #405. The next station, #407, is further away (~12 km), but also \n\nexperienced improvements in short-term forecasting thanks to the new \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n190 \n\npresence of the superstation at the ocean line in Changi Bay. In fact, \n\nseveral HDB residential blocks have PV systems at or near the location \n\nin #407, which would, under the normal network architecture, suffer from \n\nforecasting error peaks with the storm arrival. \n\n Table 23 shows the 15-min and 30-min Persistence forecasting for \n\nstations #405 and #407 without any assistance from the new station. The \n\ntable then highlights the new and lower errors when using knowledge \n\nahead of time provided by station #426. \n\nTable 23: Daily nRMSE results for selected case studies with a storm \n\napproaching from E-SE, with and without the use of a new deployed \n\nsuperstation (NOBRE et al., 2015 (in preparation)). \n\nStation/Forecast Horizon Persistence \n\n[nRMSE] \n\nHybrid \n\n[nRMSE] \n\nUncertainty \n\nReduction \n\n[% abs] \n\n#405/15-min 22.2% 20.2% -2.0% \n#405/30-min 24.2% 21.0% -3.2% \n#407/15-min 21.6% 19.0% -2.6% \n#407/30-min 25.2% 21.1% -4.1% \n\n \n\nAlso as previously discussed, the importance of the expansion of \n\nthe network of stations in Singapore is further justified by the fact that \n\nmassive volumes of PV systems might be embedded in regions currently \n\noutside of the maximum reach of the existing weather stations. For the \n\nexample shown here, an industrial area (\u201cIndustry 4\u201d) benefited from the \n\nexistence of station #426. Results have shown give enough evidence to \n\nstakeholders (e.g. grid operators) that the investment on extra stations is \n\nneeded for further error curtailment in an area of interest. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n191 \n\n4.1.4 Cloud vectoring demonstration and functionality \n\nIt was intuitive to derive that by extending the network of remote \n\nsensing stations, that a) a longer reach on weather knowledge would be \n\nachieved and b) that areas of Singapore not covered by the maximum \n\nrange of superstations could be addressed. The expansion project for the \n\nstations is a \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d, which can be easily realized with further \n\nhardware investments and use of the existing system software backbone \n\ninfrastructure. \n\nHowever, extending a network addresses primarily areas of the \n\nisland not previously covered. With the sky camera network deployment, \n\nit was intended that new insights into the Singapore climatic conditions \n\nare brought to light.  \n\n Here, two case studies are presented. The first one sees a moving \n\nSumatra squall on the 1st July 2015 entering Singapore from the W-NW \n\nborder. The sequence of Doppler images covering a period of 1.5 hours \n\nis shown in Figure 91. Via the sky camera network, selecting eight \n\ncameras at specific locations of the island, the vector directions were \n\nobtained for 1-min resolution and averaged to match the same interval as \n\nthe Doppler images. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 91: Storm progression through Singapore, with resultant vector \n\ntaking eight sky cameras into account for predominant cloud direction path \n\n(NOBRE et al., 2015 (in preparation)). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n192 \n\nThe resultant vector direction for every interval between Doppler \n\nimages yielded the yellow arrows shown in Figure 91. These directions \n\nshowed a good agreement with the storm progression. Such findings \n\nassist knowledge gaining of cloud physics for the country. \n\nThe second case study also tackles the progression of a Sumatra \n\nsquall occurring on the 4th July 2015. Figure 92 shows the squall Doppler \n\nradar sequence at the bottom of the image. The eight sky cameras vector \n\ndirections are plotted at an approximate location where the devices are \n\ninstalled in the country. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 92: Storm progression through Singapore, with resultant vectors \n\nfrom eight sky cameras (NOBRE et al., 2015 (in preparation)). \n\nIn Figure 92, a good agreement is seen between actual storm \n\ntraveling path (as per Doppler radar images, indicating a West-East \n\ndirection), with actual cloud vectoring information (also primarily \n\nshowing an Eastwards and South-eastwards path. This particular finding \n\nis an indication that information from one location of the island can serve \n\nto the benefit of other locations, even several kilometers away. Cloud \n\nvectoring can also potentially assist in future investigations on haze \n\narrival and dissipation. \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n193 \n\n4.2 POWER CONVERSION SIMULATION RESULTS \n\n4.2.1 Results on factors affecting PV power output \n\nThe following are results achieved while investigating five heavy \n\ninfluencers to PV system power output. \n\n[A] Test #1: System modeling \n\nA previous work by Mellit and Pavan (MELLIT and PAVAN, \n\n2010) suggested that an arbitrary value of performance ratio could be used \n\nin order to promote modeling of the PV power after obtaining the forecast \n\nvalues for irradiance. As seen from results next, testing the parameters \n\nover five challenges described in subsection 3.4.2, this proves to be an \n\nover-simplification for a diverse fleet of PV systems and environment. \n\nIn Test #1, which deals with the PV modeling selection, Equations \n\n9-11 were used, modeling the PV system power output first when GHI \n\nand Tamb are the only known parameters. A nRMSE of 3.8% was achieved \n\nfor data from March 2010 for a then new crystalline wafer-based system \n\nin Singapore (see Table 24, also displaying all other tests executed). \n\nWhen testing the second model, with Gmod and Tmod known, a more \n\nrefined fit was achieved, with the lowest nRMSE of the three tested \n\nmodels, at 1.9%. The estimation via an arbitrary performance ratio (here \n\n0.80) generates the highest errors, with nRMSE of 5.4%. The use of such \n\na generic value of PR has not only a higher error but would also influence \n\nother tests discussed next. \n\nTable 24: AC power output conversion model normalized root mean square \n\nerrors according to the five test sequences proposed in the investigations \n\n(NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n194 \n\n[B] Test #2: Temperature losses \n\nContinuing the tests, a typical rooftop mounting Ross coefficient \n\nof ? = 0.023\u00baCm2W-1 was chosen (Test #2), based on (YE et al., 2013) as \n\nthe simulation baseline. For a concrete rooftop, the PV power output \n\nmodeling error showed a nRMSE of 4.6%. When assuming the same \n\nvalue of ? but using a metal rooftop-installed PV system, the nRMSE \n\nfurther increases to 9.4%, highlighting the importance of knowing system \n\ndetails to be considered during power output modeling. The heating \n\nprofile for the two PV systems is shown in Figure 93 (left), where visually \n\none can attest from the time series that the metal rooftop causes a higher \n\nmodule temperature when compared to the concrete one, which is \n\nestimated, for the given day in the example, as being ~15% higher for the \n\nmetal rooftop on average.  \n\nThe variation of module against ambient temperature with regards \n\nto irradiance on module plane at the sites allows the plotting of the graph \n\non Figure 93 (right). The slope of the linear fit indicates the value for the \n\nRoss coefficient, here for March 2010, 0.032\u00baCm2W-1 and 0.025\u00baCm2W-\n\n1, for metal and concrete roofs, respectively. Roof color was not one of \n\nthe aspects addressed in the investigations. The two test sites used for the \n\nanalysis are ~2 km apart with nearly identical irradiation patterns for the \n\nperiod of study. Models used were for Gmod and Tmod known. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 93: Module temperatures time series at two PV systems ~2 km apart \n\n(top left). The modules on a metal rooftop are in average ~15% hotter than \n\nthe concrete one (bottom left). The temperature difference between module \n\nand ambient temperatures on the metal rooftop are compared against a \n\nsystem on a concrete rooftop (right) (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n195 \n\n[C] Test #3: Shading influences \n\nTest #3 discusses shading in a densely-built environment as \n\ncommonly found in Singapore, which can also lead to considerable \n\ndeviations in the PV power conversion. In Figure 94 (left), the normalized \n\npower AC output of two PV systems on the same building are plotted, \n\nwith one section of the system clearly shaded in the mid-afternoon. Figure \n\n94 (right) portrays the readings of two irradiance sensors at the shaded \n\nand unshaded locations averaged for an entire year. The afternoon \n\nshading is clearly seen, but also in other parts of the day a lower level of \n\nirradiance is detected at the canopy location. All in all, irradiation at the \n\nshaded canopy is 27% lower than on the top of the building. The \n\nirradiance reduction experienced in this case study was observed to curtail \n\npower output of up to 90%. This type of shading is usually classified as \n\n\u201chard shading\u201d. For \u201csoft shading\u201d, generally cast by trees, chimneys, \n\nelevator shafts or other smaller objects, which leave parts of the system \n\nstill exposed to the full sun, losses can amount to anywhere between 30% \n\nand 60%, based on own measurement data in Singapore. Data simulated \n\nis from March 2015, for an already 5-year old system at the hospital \n\ncomplex discussed (system #115). The nRMSE for the unshaded system \n\nwas higher when compared to a newer system. Taking the shaded section \n\ninto account, the error climbs to 32.1%. The model used for Test #3 \n\nassumed Gmod and Tmod known. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 94: Normalized power AC output sections of a shaded and unshaded \n\nPV systems (left). One year data for two irradiance sensors are shown for \n\nboth conditions investigated (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n196 \n\n[D] Test #4: Long-term degradation \n\nIn Test #4, data from a PV system in its early months after \n\ndeployment was used (March 2010, year one of operations) to evaluate \n\nthe power output simulation from that period in time. The nRMSE was \n\nfound to be 3.4%, with Gmod and Tmod known, with a PR for the month of \n\n81.2%. When simulating the same system five years later, nRMSE was \n\ncalculated at 9.0%, with PR for the month at 78.1%. The degradation \n\ntrend for the system is shown in Figure 95 (left). It is important to note \n\nthat the PV system used for this example obviously has experienced a \n\nlong-term performance decay of approximately -1.0% per annum, i.e. \n\nabove levels typically reported in literature (-0.5%, as per (JORDAN and \n\nKURTZ, 2013)). Figure 95 (right) shows the normalized power AC \n\noutput of the system on a sunny day in 2010 and a similar day in 2015. \n\nThe reduction in power generation potential of the system can be clearly \n\nseen. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 95: 5-year period of a PV system\u2019s daily performance ratios (left). \n\nThe power output of a single typical day five years apart also shows the \n\nnoticeable system degradation (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\nOn the topic of system degradation, the author has worked on the \n\nbenchmarking of several PV systems in Singapore, which includes the \n\nreporting of advanced decay of systems\u2019 performance ratios, such as the \n\none shown in Figure 96, which belongs to the heavily soiled flat \n\ninstallation in Figure 60.  \n\n\n\n \n\n197 \n\n \n\nFigure 96: Recorded 5-year degradation records for the PV system shown in \n\nFigure 60, where advanced soiling has been detected (NOBRE et al., 2015 (in \n\npreparation)). \n\n[E] Test #5: Irradiance availability due to air pollution  \n\nThe final test describes the influence of air pollution levels as \n\nobject of study, with Gmod and Tmod known (Test #5). Figure 97 (left) plots \n\nthe normalized power AC output of a crystalline wafer-based PV system \n\non an extremely hazy day (pollutant standards index, PSI > 200) in June \n\n2013. The PV power conversion works well nonetheless (nRMSE = 2.4%, \n\nnRMSE for clear skies = 2.5%), as from the perspective of the simulation \n\nmodel, the haze acts simply as a cloudy day. This would not be the case \n\nif the simulated PV system were a thin-film technology one, as \n\ndemonstrated in (LIU et al., 2014b), since the haze affects the spectrum \nof the irradiation in a detrimental way for those systems. Figure 97 (right) \n\nshows the ratio for power AC between an air-polluted versus a clear sky \n\nday. The days are 30 days apart so that the degradation of the system does \n\nnot play an influencing role. For the two days compared, a reduction in \n\npower of circa 25% can be seen. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n198 \n\n \n\nFigure 97: PV system normalized power AC output on a day with clean skies \n\n(PSI &lt;50) and with polluted skies (PSI > 200) (left). The hazy sky day incurs \n\n~25% power output for the PV system (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\nPV power conversion forecasting guidelines \n\nFigure 98 shows the Persistence forecasting being utilized together \n\nwith the PV power conversion modeling as discussed in section 5.1 of this \n\nwork (here, Gmod and Tmod known are used). When not considering the \n\nsystem aging aspect into account, the power output modeling error is \n\nfurther transmitted to the power forecasting. The five tests discussed in \n\nsections 4.2 and 5.1 are repeated, taking a simplistic Persistence \n\nforecasting into account, with results shown in Table 6. \n\nNotably, when Tests #1 through #4 are shown to induce power \n\nconversion errors, these are further transferred to the overall system level \n\nand possibly aggravate the effects from assessing what the level of PV \n\npower produced at the present moment in time will be, as well as for a \n\ncountry\u2019s fleet power output. In that sense, older PV systems or systems \n\ninstalled on metal rooftops seem to especially cause overestimations of \n\nthe amount of power to be generated. \n\nOn the other hand, taking the fact that other larger degradation \n\nlevels have been reported in Singapore likely due to soiling accumulation \n\nfor installations at shallow tilt angles (NOBRE et al., 2013), forecasting \n\npower output for solar systems in this tropical environment could further \n\nbe over-estimated, if installations follow the common belief of matching \n\ntheir tilt angles to the local latitude, versus adopting a minimum 10-degree \n\ntilt angle to promote the so called self-cleaning effect from rain. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n199 \n\n \n\nFigure 98: Simulated versus measured power DC for a 15 kWp PV system \n\nduring its first year of operation (top left) and five years later (top right). A \n\nlarger error was observed for the now older PV system when a simple \n\nPersistence forecast was performed (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)).  \n\nImportant to note when forecasting under hazy conditions is that \n\nPV power conversion and forecasting does not get considerably affected \n\nwhen systems are made of crystalline silicon technologies; however, grid \n\noperators ought to be aware that a general reduction of PV power \n\ngeneration in the absence of regular clouds in the sky, as shown in Figure \n\n97 (right). \n\nSummarizing, Table 25 aims to provide guidelines and execution \n\nsteps for both power conversion and power forecasting for a PV system \nin a tropical setting, not considering the relatively low wind influence. \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n200 \n\nTable 25: Power conversion guidelines for a PV system in a tropical \n\nenvironment assuming low wind speeds (NOBRE et al., 2015 (submitted)). \n\n \n \n\nAlthough the essence of this investigation was carried out in \n\ntropical Singapore, the systematic can be adjusted to other weather \n\nconditions. For a temperate climate, the metal/concrete rooftop dynamic \n\nwould play a different role due to different ambient temperature and wind \n\nconditions, also from the fact that other types of mounting system \n\nsituations could be found, such as ground-mounted installations in non-\n\narea-constraint countries. Similarly, PV systems in open areas would not \n\nface the challenging shading conditions found in an urban context. \n\nThirdly, degradation rates, an important topic of study for the long-term \n\nstability of PV installations, are likely to be less influential in temperate \n\nlocations, with milder weather and steeper tilt angles of installation, \n\nwhich facilitate a better cleaning effect of the panels. Finally, the \n\noccasional situation of the haze pollution in Singapore could also be of \n\nrelevance elsewhere, with varying polluting agents (e.g. smog, particles \n\nfrom construction/transportation, sandstorms), and possibly different \n\nduration, intensity, seasonality, and movement patterns.  \n\n\n\n \n\n201 \n\n4.2.2 Air pollution investigation findings \n\nAs the topic of air pollution was perceived to be of interest for the \n\nfuture planning of the grid in Singapore due to seasonal tendencies of haze \n\nepisodes, this topic was further explored during the past years within the \n\ncourse of this thesis. \n\nFigure 99 shows examples of global horizontal irradiance time \n\nseries for three weather conditions \u2013 a sunny, a rainy and a cloudy day in \n\nSingapore, respectively, and the progression of the data points being \n\neliminated through the three proposed filters in 3.4.3. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 99: Filter performance progression for three different weather \n\nconditions (NOBRE et al., 2015 (accepted)). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n202 \n\nFigure 100 shows one-minute averaged time steps for post-filtered \n\nirradiance values (as black dots) taking into account June data only, as \n\nwell as the curve fits optimized for the available data points (orange lines). \n\nAs an example, for all days categorized with PSI values below 50, the \n\ncalculated average solar irradiance day indicated a total irradiation of 6.70 \n\nkWh/m2. The modeled clear sky irradiance for all June days is plotted as \n\na guide to the eyes (red dotted line). The areas under the curve fits \n\nrepresent the calculated irradiation found for the four selected air \n\npollution levels. The readings used are for global horizontal irradiances \n\nrecorded at the SERIS meteorological station using a calibrated \n\npyranometer as a measurement device.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 100: Post-filtered resulting daily irradiance averages for four varying \n\nlevels of air pollution (NOBRE et al., 2015 (accepted)). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n203 \n\nAs values of air pollution increase, irradiation at ground level is \n\nreduced. Starting from the second PSI bin (50-75), irradiation levels \n\ndropped by 3.3% against the modeled clear sky days, followed by 13.5% \n\nfor the third PSI bin (75-100) and finally by 14.9% for all days with PSI \n\nabove 100. Figure 101 summarizes these findings not only for the case of \n\nthe measurements by a pyranometer, but also with the use of a silicon \n\nsensor at the same meteorological station. As mentioned earlier in this \n\nthesis, a reduction of irradiation of ~5% due to the narrower spectral range \n\nof the silicon sensor was expected. Loss of irradiation with an increase of \n\nair pollution showed similar trends to the results assessed with the use of \n\na pyranometer. A linear fit is included as a guide to the eye. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 101: Calculated typical solar irradiation day (in kWh/m2) using June \n\ndata for several ranges of the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI). Readings for \n\na pyranometer and from a silicon sensor are shown (NOBRE et al., 2015 \n\n(accepted)). \n\nThe irradiation level for the exceptional day with hazy but \ncloudless conditions (PSI = 109, on 24 June 2013, shown in Figure 62) is \n\nalso plotted in Figure 101. Irradiance measurements carry an uncertainty \n\nof anywhere between 2% and 5%, depending on the sensor type used in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n204 \n\nthe analysis, hence that day\u2019s readings are within the uncertainty of the \n\nanalysis. \n\nTable 26 shows the in-plane irradiation for ten PV systems during \n\nthe June clear sky day conditions, following the same methodology \n\ncarried out earlier for Figure 100. Irradiation losses between clear sky \n\nconditions and the hazy day of 24 June 2013 ranged between 13% and \n\n22%. These variations likely depend on irradiation values, as well as haze \n\nlevels throughout Singapore, which tend to vary up to 20 PSI points \n\nwithin the five locations monitored by NEA. Also, tilt angles and \n\norientations of the in-plane irradiation sensors would yield slight \n\ndifferences for the given June day, even for a low latitude location such \n\nas Singapore (1?N of the Equator). \n\nTable 26: Daily total irradiation on module plane, PV systems\u2019 yield and \n\nperformance ratio (PR) for clear sky conditions (\u201cclear\u201d) as per method \n\ndescribed in this work (combination of days with PSI &lt;50) and during a \n\nstrong hazy conditions day (24th June 2013, \u201chazy\u201d). PV systems are located \n\nin several parts of Singapore and installed at different tilt angles and \n\nazimuths (NOBRE et al., 2015 (accepted)). \n\n \n \n\nThe specific yields (in kWh/kWp per day) for the ten PV systems \n\nunder evaluation are also shown in Table 26. Derived energy yield losses \n\nof thin-film based PV systems due to haze were, on average, some 4% \n\n(absolute) lower than losses for crystalline silicon wafer-based PV \n\nsystems. In contrast, the performance ratio for the systems shows a slight \n\nincrease of PR for the crystalline silicon systems, while the thin-film \n\nsystems suffer from an average drop of nearly 5%. Such a mechanism \n\n\n\n \n\n205 \n\nwas investigated by Liu et al. (LIU et al., 2014a), demonstrating that a \n\nspectrum shift during the haze season is more detrimental to thin-film \n\nbased PV systems in Singapore than for crystalline silicon based ones. Ye \n\net al. (JIAYING et al., 2014) reported similar effects but for single \n\nmodules of four thin-film PV technologies under assessment in \n\nSingapore. R\u00fcther and Livingstone (R\u00dcTHER and LIVINGSTONE, \n\n1995) and R\u00fcther et al. (R\u00dcTHER et al., 2002) have also previously \n\nreported on spectral effects on the performance of thin-film silicon PV \n\ndevices, showing the beneficial effects of blue-rich content of sunlight, \n\nemphasizing the fact that due to their narrower spectral range, thin-film \n\nPV devices are much more sensitive to spectral shifts in the content of \n\nsunlight than bulk crystalline silicon devices. Dirnberger et al. \n\n(DIRNBERGER et al., 2015) elaborated on the spectral response of \n\nseveral PV technologies although the air pollution situation was not part \n\nof the study. \n\nOne other impact to analyze is the change in ambient and module \n\ntemperatures, knowing that the reduction of PV power output through \n\nhigh module temperatures is the single-largest loss factor for PV systems \n\nin Singapore (YE et al., 2013). Results are shown in Table 27. In spite of \na slight increase in ambient temperature recorded during the hazy day, \n\nambient temperatures in general throughout the various sites still fell \n\nwithin the 2-sigma standard deviation zone from the average temperature \n\nfound on a clear sky day. It is noticed, however, that the module \n\ntemperatures were lower on hazy days for both crystalline silicon wafer \n\nbased and thin-film based systems when compared to temperatures on a \n\nclear sky day. A lower total irradiation on the modules results in cooler \n\nPV cells. This should particularly be the case for red-rich spectra as blue \n\nphotons contribute stronger to thermalization losses in the PV cells, i.e. a \n\nsmaller fraction of their energy is used for the photovoltaic effect, and \n\nhence they contribute more strongly to heating up the module. Such \n\nvariations would affect voltage of PV devices, but the energy amounts \n\ninvolved in this situation are, however, quite small and of a second order \n\nof influence, with the effect of the higher direct irradiance of clear days \n\nexpected to be the dominating effect. Therefore, impacts on the irradiance \n\nlevels which directly affect current driven in the photovoltaic systems \n\nwould have a predominant contribution level to the impact of haze on the \n\nyield of PV systems. \n\nTo conclude the haze investigations for PV applications in \n\nSingapore, the technical assessment of its impact was merged with \n\nfinancial implications for a future substantial fleet of systems in the \n\ncountry. Table 28 presents some of the assumptions and findings derived \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n206 \n\nfrom the techno-financial model investigated, with a 3 GWp fleet of \n\nsystems losing near 120 GWh and 26 million SGD in revenue during a \n\n10-day haze episode which mimics the June 2013 haze crisis. \n\nTable 27: Daily total ambient and module temperature averages for clear \n\nsky conditions (NOBRE et al., 2015 (accepted)). \n\n \n\nTable 28: Preliminary findings on loss of revenue to a future fleet of PV \n\nsystems in Singapore during a 10-day haze episode which mimics the June \n\n2013 crisis (NOBRE et al., 2015 (in preparation)). \n\nParameter 2014 2020 2030 \n\nPV systems deployed [MWp] 33 650 3,000 \n\nCrystalline silicon share [%] 90% 95% 97% \n\nSystem yield [kWh/kWp] 1,100 1,112 1,132 \n\nElectricity tariff [SGD/kWh] 0.243 0.200 0.232 \n\nEnergy loss in haze [GWh] ~1.5 ~26.5 ~119.3 \nEnergy loss in haze [MSGD] ~1 ~4.5 ~25.8 \n\n \n\nThe investigations on the effects of haze on PV systems in \n\nSingapore presented throughout this thesis have been published as a \n\ncontribution in the IEEE\u2019s \u201cJournal of Photovoltaics\u201d (LIU et al., 2014b), \n\nsee 6. Work on aspects of irradiation attenuation due to haze and loss of \n\nrevenue in PV applications are part of the outcome of investigations \n\nwithin this thesis, with the paper on irradiation reduction due to air \n\npollution accepted in the journal \u201cRenewable Energy\u201d.  \n\n\n\n \n\n207 \n\n4.2.3 Results on up-scaling exercises \n\nAs 90-95% of the installed capacity of PV systems in Singapore is \n\nof crystalline wafer-based technology, the up-scaling routine tested \n\nwithin the thesis focused on those systems.

These two \n\nsystems alone highlight areas of focus of this thesis of PV system \n\nmodeling concerns. \n\nNew and professionally installed systems such as #904 and #908 \n\nalso give an indication that such devices, when new, can indeed be \n\nestimated as having a performance ratio of 80%, however, with little time \nelapsed, start to deviate considerably from benchmark results. \n\nAlso worth noting is the average system yield for the month, 3.30 \n\nkWh/kWp per day, with a March Gmod resource average of 144.8 kWh/m\n2. \n\nThis is translated to a PR of only ~71%, once again highlighting that there \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n208 \n\nis room for improvement in system performance in Singapore towards \n\ninternational benchmark levels above 80%. \n\nSimulating a single PV system on a regular or detailed basis can \n\nultimately create minimum errors in such exercises, as the user gets more \n\nand more familiar with the system\u2019s characteristics and behavior as the \n\nmodeling repetitions continue. However, when modeling a fleet of \n\nsystems, a few challenges that occur are volume of the fleet, correctness \n\nof the information gathered from a system and sensor accuracy &amp; \n\nmaintenance practices for the benchmarking of the validation.  \n\nThe National Solar Repository of Singapore allows for the tapping \n\nof further PV data for future exercises. Although this data is not as precise \n\nas other research-grade datasets available, also not with the same time \n\nresolution of 1-min, monthly (and daily) energy readings allow for up-\n\nscaling exercises in terms of how the average output of a considerable \n\namount of systems in the country\u2019s PV fleet would be. \n\n Extrapolating to 100% of the PV facilities on a country-level could \n\ngive utility operators in Singapore initial indication on PV system output \n\non an island level for at least monthly intervals (at first). It is expected \n\nthat such method is still more accurate than the one shown in Figure 22 \n\nfor Germany (SMA, 2013a), as the ratio of empirical to up-scaled data for \n\nthe pool of systems in Singapore is greater than for the European country. \n\nSuch products can today be run on a monthly basis (for 25% of systems \n\nup-scaled to 100%, a ratio of 1:4), and on a daily basis only for a ratio of \n\n~1:20. Dilution of the initiative database capabilities is continuous, with \n\nmore systems deployed and NSR not able to add systems fast enough to \n\nmatch the solar market growth rates. \n\nFinally, with a good up-scaling routine derived via the \n\ninvestigations of this thesis, the amount of total solar electricity produced \n\nin Singapore for a given month can be better estimated. For the case study \n\naddressed, it would have meant that monthly solar PV output would have \n\nbeen 3.38 GWh (based on the recorded monthly yield of 3.30 kWh/kWp \n\nper day and a country installed capacity of 33 MWp). Encouraging is that \n\neven without the readings from the ten PV systems presented, only with \n\nthe available irradiance network in the country plus database information \n\non system characteristics, one would have been able to calculate a \n\nmonthly energy generation potential of 3.48 GWh, slightly \n\noverestimating it by a couple percentage points. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n209 \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n \n\n5.1 ON THE MAIN FINDINGS OF THIS THESIS \n\nThe following set of conclusions can be drawn from the \n\ninvestigations surrounding the works of this thesis. \n\n5.1.1 On short-term forecasting for the tropics \n\nIn this thesis, methods for short-term irradiance forecasting were \n\nbenchmarked. Also included was the development of a novel method to \n\nreduce prediction errors, based on weather observations and readings \n\nfrom a remote sensing network. Improvements in short-term irradiance \n\nforecasting were achieved for three severe weather conditions, namely: \n\nstorms, washout days and haze days. \n\nThe storm detection triggers by far provided the best enhancement \n\nin the short-term forecasts (for 15-min and 30-min horizons), with \n\nnRMSE of the proposed Hybrid method reducing absolute errors by an \n\naverage of 10.0% versus a baseline Persistence forecasting approach. \n\nStormy days are good targets for prediction improvements due to the \n\nsudden nature of weather phenomena in the tropics and \u201cover-reliance\u201d \n\nof stochastic methods in past data. \n\nThe novel Hybrid algorithm also addressed complete \u201cwashout\u201d \n\ndays (i.e. with continuous rainfall) where it was proposed the use of the \n\nPersistence forecasting method throughout. The third severe \n\nmeteorological condition was haze from transboundary forest fires. A \n\nfurther recommendation resulting from the findings is that the Persistence \n\nforecasting method be also used during periods of intense air pollution, \n\nsimplifying forecasting methodologies. \n\nThe new developed algorithm now runs live at the SERIS\u2019 PV \n\nSystem Monitoring Laboratory. It assists the team in understanding local \n\nweather as well as observing forecasting error behavior (see Figure 102 \n\nfor a developed user interface). \n\nThe work presented here was designed for a location at the center \n\nof the sensor network (center of the island). The achieved uncertainty \n\nreduction likely would not be the same for peripheral areas, which would \n\nbe at the mercy of the arrival of sudden storms with little or no warning. \n\nTherefore, areas of future improvement were addressed via a remote \n\nsensing network extension. It was demonstrated that such decision would \n\nhelp reduce forecasting errors at other parts of the island nearer to the sea. \n\nThe network expansion was underway at the closure of this thesis. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n210 \n\nFurthermore, the use of sky cameras for cloud motion tracking was \n\nshown to assist in detection and modeling of cloud patterns and thus help \n\nto further improve irradiance forecasting. Sky cameras would also allow \n\nfor a better understanding of cloud physics, as well as assist future local \n\nscientists in the development of new forecasting algorithms for short-term \n\npurposes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 102: Live map (top left of each image sequence, here 15-min), \n\nincluding forecasting (top right), error (bottom left) and Doppler radar \n\n(bottom right) developed within the works of this thesis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n211 \n\nThe increasing penetration levels with variable solar PV in electric \n\npower systems worldwide will require both short and long-term \n\nprediction forecasts of the irradiance in order to assist the balancing of \n\nenergy generation from renewables and fossil-fuel-based sources, as well \n\nas the proper conversion of irradiance forecasts into actual PV power \n\ngeneration readily useable by grid-operators. In Singapore, as an example \n\nof a liberalized electricity market in a tropical location, energy trading is \n\ncarried out at 30-min intervals, whose system would benefit most from \n\nforecasts similar to the ones presented in this work. It also assists a future \n\nenergy market where solar photovoltaics play a larger role, with \n\ncontribution levels that may account for as much as 20% of the energy \n\nneeds of the city-state. \n\n  The discovery of areas of improvement helps delineate a path for \n\nsimilar work which could be experienced by other researchers in areas \n\nwith similar weather patterns around the globe. Studying these extreme \n\nweather conditions as the one shown in Figure 11 and their effect on a \n\ngrowing number of solar photovoltaic systems are topics of great interest \n\nto various power system operators. \n\nAlthough Singapore has a relative small area versus countries or \n\neven states within a certain country, the island does mimic the size of \n\nmajor city centers, thus allowing for the replication of similar remote \n\nsensing networks and meteorological boundary condition assessment as \n\nthe ones discussed in this work, likely for locations with similar climate \n\npatterns. \n\n5.1.2 On PV systems power conversion \n\nSmall gains in forecast accuracy, when obtained, can be quickly \n\nwiped out when using only a rough power conversion methodology, \n\ntypical of present analyses in the field. Challenges in PV power \n\ngeneration and forecasting for a tropical, densely-built environment in \n\nSingapore were introduced, tested and verified, demonstrating the \n\nsignificant errors introduced when they are not considered.  \n\nBased on these findings, guidelines were given to facilitate better \n\npower simulation and forecasting in the future. Although this thesis \n\nconducted tests at a tropical location, the parameters considered can be \n\nadjusted according to other weather conditions at hand. \nFor air pollution aspects, i.e. anthropogenic-induced haze for the \n\ncase of Singapore, global horizontal irradiation was assessed via a series \n\nof proposed filters in order to gauge the reduction of irradiation at ground \n\nlevel caused by haze, primarily originating from forest and agricultural \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n212 \n\nland clearing fires mostly in Sumatra (Indonesia). Blockage of sunlight \n\ndue to haze was investigated in neighboring Singapore, 150-300 km away \n\nfrom the majority of the fire \u201chot spots\u201d. \n\nA novel filtering technique was proposed and implemented to \n\ndifferentiate between the impacts from clouds and air pollution caused by \n\nhaze on the reduction on irradiance levels on the ground. Parameters used \n\nin the filtering included relative humidity and clear sky indices in order \n\nto sequentially remove the effects of rain and clouds on irradiation levels. \n\nA third filter was proposed in order to eliminate cloud-edge/enhancement \n\neffects (over-irradiances) or near cloudy conditions which could fall \n\nwithin sensor accuracy levels. \n\nGlobal horizontal irradiance level reductions reached ~25% during \n\na strong haze episode of June 2013, both when performing the analysis \n\nwith the use of a pyranometer as well as with a crystalline silicon sensor \n\nthat has a narrower spectral range. \n\nThe yield of ten PV systems across Singapore \u2013 both of crystalline \n\nwafer-based and thin-film silicon technologies \u2013 was investigated. PV \n\nsystems suffered losses ranging from 15-25% when haze was strong at \n\nrecord air pollution indices in the unhealthy range registered for \n\nSingapore in June 2013. Thin-film technology-based PV installations \n\nexperienced greater losses than crystalline wafer-based systems due to \n\nspectral effects. Ambient temperatures during haze periods were slightly \n\nhigher than on clear sky days, whereas module temperatures were lower, \n\nlikely due to loss of direct irradiation reaching solar module surfaces. \n\nWith more widespread use of PV generation expected in \n\nSingapore, a near-future scenario with 1 GWp of deployed installations \n\nconnected to the grid is likely to happen within the next 5-8 years. If major \n\nhaze from Southeast Asia hits the country by then, associated losses, even \n\nthough such episodes have a short duration of a few days or weeks, could \n\nbe considerable. The effect for future scenarios (in 2020 and in 2030) was \n\ncalculated, with losses due to a week\u2019s worth of haze in the millions of \n\ndollars. Similar effects could take place elsewhere in the world with rising \n\nair pollution levels affecting the output (and eventually also the \n\nprofitability) of solar PV renewable energy technology. Calculating the \n\neconomic losses due to haze is a natural next step, adding to the ongoing \n\nargumentation between countries on issues related to reduction of air \n\npollution levels, which so far have focused primarily, and naturally, on \n\nhealth issues.  \n\nPerformance ratios of a-Si based and c-Si based PV systems \n\noperating in Singapore were found to behave differently during the haze \n\n\n\n \n\n213 \n\nevent in June 2013. It was showed that this effect can be attributed to a \n\nchange in the generated short-circuit current resulting from a change in \n\nthe spectral composition of the incident sunlight. During the haze period, \n\na red-shift of the spectrum reaching the module planes was observed. This \n\nshift can be attributed to scattering of light at airborne haze particles. This \n\nchange in the spectral composition negatively impacted a-Si systems, \n\nwhich mostly rely on short wavelengths (&lt;650 nm), but had a slight \n\npositive effect on c-Si systems which have the best spectral response at \n\nnear-infrared wavelengths (800 to 900 nm). A clear correlation exists \n\nbetween the spectral changes and the performance ratios, as was validated \n\nby measurements as well as statistical analysis. As a rule of thumb, it can \n\nbe concluded that the impact of haze on the PV power output is most \n\nsevere for PV systems employing high-bandgap solar cells (such as a-Si \n\nsolar cells), whereas crystalline silicon modules continue to perform well \n\n(efficiency-wise) under such conditions.  \n\nWhen dealing with irradiance forecasting, artificial intelligence \n\ntechniques and time series analysis use past data in order to estimate the \n\nfuture irradiance value horizon. For a forecast algorithm, lower irradiance \n\nvalues during haze events will simply be perceived as cloudy conditions, \n\nnot up to full expected irradiation levels according to the modeled clear \n\nsky irradiance bell-shape profile. However, attenuation of irradiation does \n\nplay a role in diminishing maximum output of systems and consequently \n\nlowers returns on investments. While the latter directly affects system \n\nowners and investors, the former is a technical component which plays a \n\nrole in future energy pricing and market forces, as limited availability of \n\nsolar PV power output due to haze means more fossil-fuel generation of \n\nelectricity is needed to supply the loads. This is the situation in Singapore, \n\nwhich is primarily generating electricity from natural gas power plants.  \n\nWhile this analysis was performed for Singaporean conditions, it \n\nis believed that it can also provide useful insight into PV systems \n\ndeployed at other locations where the spectrum seen by the modules is \n\naffected by haze. For instance, industrial smog in China and forest fire \n\nsmog in Brazil may affect PV system performance in a similar way. \n\nQuantification of the impact of haze on the solar irradiance could be the \n\nsubject of future works.  \n   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n214 \n\n5.2 LIMITATIONS OF THE WORK \n\nThe findings of this thesis are constrained to the location \n\nSingapore, a relatively small tropical island in Southeast Asia, with hot \n\nand humid weather throughout the year, yet a bustling city center with a \n\nrapidly growing population and expanding PV fleet. Although it is \n\nexpected that several of the findings introduced could be applicable to \n\nother tropical locations of the world, particular weather phenomena must \n\nbe taken into consideration for individual cases, such as the example of \n\nrain squalls in Singapore. \n\nThe thesis does not address the impact energy storage might have \n\non the future of PV technology and its interface with local grids. \n\nAdvancements of the knowledge ought to be considered for similar works \n\nin the future, e.g. the use of battery storage solutions likely will impact \n\nsolar technology forecasting efforts and electricity pricing in a few years \n\nto come. Deployment of storage solutions, such as pumped hydro, likely \n\nwill walk hand in hand with the topic of solar irradiance forecasting in \n\nfuture grids\u2019 operation protocols. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n215 \n\n5.3 SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORKS \n\n5.3.1 Hybridization and new forecasting methods \n\nThe use of sky cameras for cloud motion tracking could assist in \n\ndetection and modeling of cloud patterns and thus help to further improve \n\nirradiance forecasting. Sky cameras would also allow for a better \n\nunderstanding of cloud heights, velocities and more refined trigger set-\n\npoints as presented in this work. This thesis briefly introduced a local \n\nnetwork of sky cameras and highlighted some of its potentials, which has \n\nsince then allowed future generations of scientists to commence efforts \n\non the enhancement of forecasting methods (see Karthik et al. in 6.1.). \n\nExtended usage of the Doppler radar images (see Figure 103) is \n\nanother possible area of expansion, since it has a 70 km radius range from \n\nits home base at Changi Airport, extending well into the ocean and nearby \n\nislands and peninsular Malaysia. Such range likely would play a role in \n\nenhancements in intra-day forecasting, e.g. 1-hr to 3-hr ahead of time. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 103: Doppler radar animation for 6/Jan/2013. Adapted from (NEA, \n\n2013).  \n\nThe Doppler radar could assist with weather phenomena motion \n\nsuch as Sumatra squalls, which come from the West part of Singapore \n\ntraveling eastwards. From Figure 103, it is possible to identify patterns \n\nreaching the other end of the island in approximately 1 hour (covering a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n216 \n\n40 km stretch in such a time). That could give a hint on cloud system \n\ntraveling speed. Rain cloud systems seem to have speeds in the order of \n\n30-60 km/h and heights of approximately 1-2 km. Such topics are worth \n\nexploring in order to enhance solar irradiance forecasting methods. \n\nThe artificial neural network implemented on this thesis was a \n\nclassic architecture, without exogenous inputs. More complex ANN \n\nconfigurations for the location Singapore are being envisioned for future \n\ndoctoral and post-doctoral studies. \n\nFurthermore, machine vision software for vector assessment can \n\nbe implemented, giving information on system travel orientation and \n\nvelocity (between image frames). Such parameters could eventually a) be \n\nimplemented as part of neural networks inputs or b) overrule other \n\nforecasting algorithms which have failed to detect the approximation of \n\nsuch dynamic weather systems. \n\nSERIS completed its ground-based irradiance network in \n\nSingapore in late 2013 and is expanding it, as discussed, during 2015 and \n\nbeyond. The acquisition of greater volumes of weather and PV system \n\ndata start to leverage new solar irradiance forecast methods and PV \n\nmodeling improvements.  \n\n5.3.2 Detailed up-scaling exercises and 3D modeling \n\nFigure 104 shows a rough geographical concentration of PV \n\ninstallations as of the end of 2014 for Singapore. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 104: Geographical distribution of the highest concentrations of PV \n\nsystems in Singapore in terms of installed capacity in 2014 (source of data: \n\nNational Solar Repository of Singapore, adapted for this thesis). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n217 \n\nSERIS has acquired laser data from the surface of Singapore, \n\nwhich will power 3D models of existing building feedstock and facilitate \n\nPV potential analysis, as well as solar resource availability onto rooftops. \n\nThe combination of real-time forecasting, PV power conversion and \n\nbuilding integrated photovoltaic potential for the country is definitely an \n\narea of interest for future R&amp;D efforts. \n\n5.3.3 Replication of remote sensing networks \n\nAlthough Singapore has a relative small area versus other countries \n\nor even states within a certain country, the island mimics the size of major \n\ncity centers, thus allowing for the replication of a similar meteorological \n\nremote sensing network. A city such as San Francisco in the Unites States \n\n(see Figure 105) has a small area of around 10x10 km, yet with ~30 MWp \n\nof solar systems deployed by 2014, such a PV fleet would be able to \n\nbenefit from enhanced PV power output forecasts.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 105: City of San Francisco, CA, USA (~10x10 km) and ~30 MWp \n\nworth of solar PV systems (adapted for this thesis). \n\nAnother such example is the state-capital island of Florian\u00f3polis, \n\nin Brazil, with an area of roughly 2/3 of Singapore, and where PV systems \n\nare about to become widespread, as PV-generated electricity has recently \n\nreached grid parity. Such remote sensing networks will allow for a better \n\nand smoother integration of photovoltaics into an urban setting. Figure \n106 shows the map of Florian\u00f3polis and additionally the one for the city \n\nof Belo Horizonte, another location in Brazil where PV is garnering \n\nconsiderable interest, with several systems already deployed. \n\nSimilarly to what was presented in this thesis, remote sensing \n\nnetworks could be expanded to cities in an attempt to learn the local \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n218 \n\nweather patterns and prepare these locations for higher levels of \n\nrenewable energy penetration in the future. Table 30 presents some of \n\nthese potential locations around the world. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 106: Cities of Belo Horizonte (~20x30 km, left) and Florian\u00f3polis \n\n(~20x50 km, right) (adapted for this thesis). \n\nTable 30: Cities around the world where remote meteorological sensing \n\nnetworks could be deployed.

Figure 107 shows the first irradiation map for \n\nSingapore which was derived from the existence of the network described \n\nin this thesis. The mapping exercise allowed the gauging of East and \n\nSouth parts of Singapore as being the most solar-resource-rich on the \n\nisland. Although the selection of the location of PV systems stumbles on \n\nthe fact that space is an issue in Singapore, for bigger area locations like \n\nBrazil, or other new tropical market frontiers, the siting of renewable \n\nenergy projects is indeed dependent on local solar resource. The Brazilian \n\nSolar Atlas is an example of a tool which allows renewable energy project \n\nlocation selection, however, many areas of the world still lack either \n\nsatellite models like the Atlas or ground-stations, as the ones shown in \n\nthis thesis for Singapore. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 107: Example of irradiance map, which was developed for Singapore \n\nduring the course of this thesis. \n\nStill on the topic of solar resource mapping and worth noting is that \n\nnot only photovoltaics projects depend on the gauging of irradiation, \n\nrather PV system performance assessment, asset operations &amp; \n\nmaintenance, and to support other renewable energy projects like solar \n\nthermal, or concentrating PV. Even other areas of science, such as \n\nagriculture or medical, have needs in knowing and tapping the local solar \n\nenergy potentials, both on a historical basis, but live, moving forward. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n220 \n\n\n\n \n\n221 \n\n6.
