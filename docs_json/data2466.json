Estas altera\u00e7\u00f5es de paisagem causam altera\u00e7\u00f5es aos habitats e afectam as esp\u00e9cies que os habitam (Blondel, 2006; Sirami e tal., 2010; Gonz\u00e1les-Meg\u00edas e tal., 2011). Assim, \u00e9 fundamental perceber quais as respostas das diferentes esp\u00e9cies a estas altera\u00e7\u00f5es de habitat e qual a sua capacidade de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o, e como essas respostas se traduzem a diferentes escalas espaciais.\nA rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre o n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies que habita uma \u00e1rea e a dimens\u00e3o dessa \u00e1rea \u00e9 dos padr\u00f5es mais estudados em ecologia, sendo designada como a rela\u00e7\u00e3o esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea (Arrhenius, 1921). A rela\u00e7\u00e3o esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea tem sido largamente verificada para v\u00e1rios sistemas naturais, no entanto, num contexto de altera\u00e7\u00e3o da paisagem e dos habitats nativos, a rela\u00e7\u00e3o esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea apresenta limita\u00e7\u00f5es ao assumir que todo o habitat \u00e9 uniforme e cont\u00ednuo. Uma vez que as esp\u00e9cies reagem diferentemente \u00e0s altera\u00e7\u00f5es de habitat (Tews e tal., 2004), \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio integrar o efeito da \u00e1rea com o efeito de habitat. Ali\u00e1s, v\u00e1rios estudos t\u00eam-se debru\u00e7ado sobre o efeito que a diversidade de habitats tem sobre a diversidade de esp\u00e9cies (Williamson, 1988; Tjorve, 2002; Desrochers et al. 2011) O modelo da rela\u00e7\u00e3o esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea \u201ccountryside, proposto por Pereira e Daily (2006), considera n\u00e3o s\u00f3 a exist\u00eancia de diferentes habitats na paisagem mas tamb\u00e9m o uso diferencial dos mesmos pelos diferentes grupos de esp\u00e9cies.\nNeste contexto, o presente trabalho, tentou responder \u00e0s seguintes quest\u00f5es: (I) Ser\u00e1 a heterogeneidade de habitats um proxy para a diversidade de esp\u00e9cies? (II) \u00c9 o efeito da \u00e1rea e o efeito da diversidade de habitats na riqueza de esp\u00e9cies, dependente da escala ou dependente nas caracter\u00edsticas de cada grupo de esp\u00e9cies? Para responder a estas quest\u00f5es, utilizou-se a Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica como caso de estudo e analisaram-se os padr\u00f5es de diversidade de passeriformes, r\u00e9pteis e anf\u00edbios \u00e0 escala da grelha de 10x10 Km2, testando a influ\u00eancia de tr\u00eas classes de vari\u00e1veis ambientais: uso do solo, vari\u00e1veis clim\u00e1ticas e topogr\u00e1ficas. No caso dos passeriformes, analisou-se diversidade de cada grupo de esp\u00e9cies com afinidades similares para os diferentes habitats, tendo-se para isso procedido \u00e0 classifica\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies em cada um destes grupos previamente.\nPara responder \u00e0 quest\u00e3o (I) realiz\u00e1mos uma s\u00e9rie de an\u00e1lises. A rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre os diferentes grupos de esp\u00e9cies e os v\u00e1rios preditores ambientais foi avaliada utilizando an\u00e1lises de correla\u00e7\u00e3o (Spearman's rho). A import\u00e2ncia relativa dos diferentes grupos de preditores (clim\u00e1ticos, topogr\u00e1ficos e de habitat) na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da riqueza espec\u00edfica foi avaliada com uma abordagem multi-modelo, onde em cada modelo de regress\u00e3o linear foram considerados v\u00e1rias combina\u00e7\u00f5es de preditores (Tabela 2). A rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre riqueza espec\u00edfica e a estrutura da paisagem (heterogeneidade) para Espanha, foi avaliada atrav\u00e9s de correla\u00e7\u00e3o de Spearman's e an\u00e1lise visual de boxplots. Para responder \u00e0 segunda quest\u00e3o (II) compar\u00e1mos o desempenho do modelo esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea cl\u00e1ssico (eqn 1) com o modelo countryside-SAR (eqn 2 e 3) \u00e0 escala regional. O desempenho dos modelos foi comparado usando o Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) e o Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Todas as an\u00e1lises foram efectuadas no programa R (http://www.r-project. org/).\nOs mapas da riqueza espec\u00edfica constru\u00eddos para a Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica mostram que a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o \u00e9 homog\u00e9nea, e que depende do taxon (Figura 3). Cada taxon respondeu diferentemente \u00e0s vari\u00e1veis ambientais testadas (Tabela 3). Todos os grupos de esp\u00e9cies, excepto o grupo de passeriformes com afinidade para habitats agr\u00edcolas, reagiram negativamente \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de \u00e1reas agr\u00edcolas. Todos os grupos de esp\u00e9cies de passeriformes mostraram uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o negativa com a presen\u00e7a de floresta ex\u00f3tica. Estes resultados est\u00e3o em acordo com outros trabalhos que mostraram que muitas esp\u00e9cies tendem a evitar \u00e1reas de cultivo intensivo e planta\u00e7\u00f5es (Di\u00e1z e tal., 1998; Donald e tal., 2001; Benton e tal, 2003).\nO clima revelou-se o factor principal na determina\u00e7\u00e3o da diversidade das esp\u00e9cies. No entanto, quando as vari\u00e1veis de habitat s\u00e3o adicionadas aos modelos de regress\u00e3o com vari\u00e1veis clim\u00e1ticas, o poder explicativo dos padr\u00f5es de diversidade melhora significativamente (Tabela 4). Encontr\u00e1mos tamb\u00e9m uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a heterogeneidade da paisagem e a diversidade para v\u00e1rios grupos taxon\u00f3micos. A domin\u00e2ncia das vari\u00e1veis clim\u00e1ticas n\u00e3o surpreende dado que a esta escala regional (10x10km ) os modelos de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies t\u00eam usado com sucesso apenas vari\u00e1veis clim\u00e1ticas (Wisz e Guisan 2009), mas diverge de padr\u00f5es encontrados \u00e0 escala local, em que a estrutura dos habitats parece ser o factor mais relevante (Atauri e Lucio, 2001; Nogu\u00e9s e Mart\u00ednez 2004; Moreno e Pizarro, 2007).\nA variedade de respostas \u00e0 heterogeneidade da paisagem, pelos diferentes grupos (Tabela 5, Figura 4), indica que as esp\u00e9cies (i.e., os grupos de esp\u00e9cies), usam a paisagem de diferente modo. A diversidade de esp\u00e9cies num habitat est\u00e1 ligada com a sua capacidade de fornecer as estruturas\nA compara\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo cl\u00e1ssico esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea com o modelo countryside demonstra que, numa paisagem multi-habitat \u00e0 escala regional, o modelo countryside \u00e9 o que melhor explica a riqueza espec\u00edfica de cada um dos grupos de esp\u00e9cies e do total n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies (Tabela 6). Para investigar o efeito da escala, os resultados foram comparados com os obtidos a escala local em estudos com plantas e aves, por Proen\u00e7a (2009) e Guilherme (2009), respectivamente. Em ambos os trabalhos constatou-se que o modelo countryside explicava melhor os padr\u00f5es esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea \u00e0 escala da paisagem. \u00c0 semelhan\u00e7a do encontrado \u00e0 escala regional, o par\u00e2metro de afinidade para o habitat preferencial apresentou o valor m\u00e1ximo em cada grupo de esp\u00e9cies. No entanto, enquanto na escala local os grupos de esp\u00e9cies apresentaram valores de afinidade significativos para os habitats alternativos, \u00e0 escala regional apenas as esp\u00e9cies florestais mostraram afinidades baixas para os habitats alternativos.\nPalavras-chave: rela\u00e7\u00e3o esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea (SAR), countryside-SAR, heterogeneidade de habitats, diversidade de esp\u00e9cies, modelos multi-habitat\nABSTRACT\nThe Mediterranean basin is one of the world \u201chotspots\u201d of biological diversity, being characterized by a long history of human use and landscape modification. Different organisms will respond differently to landscape changes and habitat modification, and the affinity of species for different habitats has to be taken into account when modeling species-area patterns. Here, we studied the effect of area and habitat diversity on the diversity of amphibians, reptiles and passerines at the Iberian Peninsula scale in a grid of 10x10km . Passerine species were separated into groups sharing similar habitat affinities. We tested the relationship between species diversity and habitat heterogeneity, assessed the relative importance of habitat predictors, climate and topographic predictors on explaining species diversity, and compared the performance of a multi-habitat speciesarea model against the performance of the classic species-area relationship. All species groups reacted positively to landscape heterogeneity, and several groups reacted negatively to the area of exotic forests and agricultural area.\nClimatic predictors explained most of the species richness distribution, but the fit of models was improved when habitat predictors were added. Species diversity patterns in a multi-habitat landscape were well described by the countryside species-area relationship. The countryside speciesarea relationship had a better fit both when predicting species-area patterns of species groups and of total species richness. Previous studies had identified the importance of land-use for species diversity at the local scale. Our results suggest that, even at a regional scale, understanding the relationships between land-use and species richness may help to assess species responses to habitat change and to define more efficient conservation measures.\nKeywords: Species diversity, habitat heterogeneity, multi-habitat landscapes, species-area relationship (SAR), countryside-SAR\nCONTENTS\nAbstract.......................................................................5\nTable of Contents..............................................................6\n1.\tIntroduction.......................................................7\n2.\tMethods............................................................10\n2.1.\tStudy area.................................................10\n2.2.\tLand-cover and\tEnvironmental data...........................10\n2.3.\tSpecies distribution........................................14\n2.4.\tData analyses...............................................14\n3.\tResults............................................................18\n4.\tDiscussion.........................................................23\nConservation implications....................................................28\nAcknowledgements...............................................................29\nReferences.....................................................................31\nAppendixes.....................................................................35\n1.\tINTRODUCTION\nMediterranean landscapes are widely recognized for their richness and diversity. The Mediterranean region supports up to 25 000 native species, corresponding to 10% of the world's flowering plants, of which 13 000 are endemic species (Blondel and Aronson, 1999; Medail and Quezel 1999; Cuttelod et al., 2008), constituting one of the world\u2019s biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al., 2000; Blondel et al., 20100. The structure and dynamics of Mediterranean landscapes are complex because of their spatial and temporal diversity (Blondel, 2006; Gonzales-Megias et al., 2011). They are generally characterized by highly heterogeneous and fine-grain mosaic, resulting from natural topographic and climatic variability (Cowling et al., 1996; Luterbacher et al., 2004) and long-term interactions of biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic processes (Blondel, 2006; Sirami et al., 2010; Blondel et al., 2010).\nThe Mediterranean Basin has been repeatedly manipulated or \u2018redesigned\u2019 by man over the last millennia, being the stage of diverse landscape dynamics, from the recurrent use of fire and, overexploitation of forest resources, to urban development processes and abandonment of agricultural land (Blondel et al., 2010). The continuous redesign of landscapes and habitats has had profound consequences for the distribution, dynamics, and turnover of species and communities (Blondel, 2006; Sirami et al., 2010; Gonzales-Megias et al., 2011). Clearing large tracts of forest for pastures and crops may have benefited native species that preferred open habitats and may have caused changes in the composition of natural communities. While these changes created an advantage for species adapted to open land habitats, other species more dependent of forest habitats may have declined due to changes in the landscape and to direct pressure from human activities (Blondel 2006; Desrochers et al. 2011).\nOne approach to the study of the response of biodiversity to habitat changes is the species-area relationship (SAR), one of ecology's few laws (Arrhenius, 1921; Brown and Lomolino, 1998). It is given by the following power law:\n(1) where S is the number of species in a sampling area of size A, c and z are constants that depend on the taxonomic group and sampling scheme respectively (Crawley and Harral, 2001, Rosenzweig, 1995). The SAR, herein classic SAR, assumes that all habitat is uniform (i.e., that species are randomly distributed within it) and continuous (i.e., unfragmented). However, when landscapes are heterogeneous, as in the case of the Mediterranean region, species will use the landscape in different\nways. If landscapes are changed, organisms will respond differently to those changes. Depending on the taxonomic group, the vegetation structure, region and the spatial scale (Tews et al., 2004), some species may disappear locally or even regionally, others may tolerate the changes and adapt, and another ones can even benefit from those changes (Mazerolle and Villard, 1999; Atuari and Lucio, 2001; Pereira and Daily, 2006). Species responses to habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably depending on what is perceived as a habitat by the species studied, per instance, landscape structure that constitute habitat heterogeneity for one group may be perceive as habitat fragmentation by another taxonomic group (Tews et al., 2004).\nOverall the application of the classic SAR to projecting the response of biodiversity to land-use change assumes that the only mechanism behind the species-area relationship is the increase of area per se. However habitat diversity may also explain species richness in a certain area. This relationship has been described, as the habitat hypothesis (Williams, 1964).Whether area or habitat diversity is more important in determining species richness in a particularly region or scale has been subject of debate (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967; Connor and McCoy, 1979; Williamson, 1988; Ricklefs and Lovette, 1999; Rosenzweig, 1995; Tjorve, 2002; Tews et al., 2004; Desrochers et al., 2011). Many authors have suggested that the area per se and the habitat diversity hypothesis are not mutually exclusive but complementary (Williamson, 1998; Ricklefs and Lovette, 1999).\nWith the aim of integrating these two mechanisms, the habitat hypothesis and the area per se hypothesis, several models for multi-habitat environments have been proposed (Tjorve 2002; Triantis et al. 2003; Pereira and Daily, 2006; Koh and Ghazoul, 2010). These models consider both, habitat diversity and, habitat size to explain species richness patterns.\nPereira and Daily (2006) proposed the countryside model, which is a multi-habitat model build on the classic SAR that accounts for the existence of different habitats in the landscape and for the differential use of habitats by species. Species are classified in species groups sharing similar habitat affinities. The estimated species richness of each species group is:\nwhere Si is the number of species in group i, hij is the affinity of species group i to habitat j and Aj is the area cover by habitat j. The total number of species in the landscape will then be given by the sum of species in each group:\nm s=ls\u2018' i=l\nwhere S is the total number of species in the landscape and m is the number of species groups.\nMulti-habitat SAR models may constitute an useful tool to assess species responses to changing landscapes, providing an important contribution to practical conservation efforts. The countryside SAR is particularly suited for this purpose because it integrates the differential use of natural and human-modified habitats by different species groups, and therefore provides more finetuned analyses of species responses to habitat change.\nThe aim of this study was to provide answers to the following questions:\n(1)\tIs landscape heterogeneity (i.e., habitat diversity) a proxy for species diversity?\n\u25a0\tWe hypothesized that for a fixed area (i) the importance of landscape heterogeneity varies with the taxonomic group and the level of specialization of species for a specific habitat, and (ii) the richness of species groups with more diverse use of habitats will be more associated with habitat diversity than the richness of species groups particularly associated with a habitat and with low affinity for other habitats; hence we predict that landscape heterogeneity will only be a proxy of species diversity if species use several habitats. Previous studies have approached the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and species diversity, yet they were mostly focused on fixed scales and small study areas (Atuari and Lucio., 2001; Tews et al., 2004; Gonzales-Megias et al., 2011), the effects at coarser scales are still poorly understood,\n(2)\tIs the effect of area and habitat diversity on species richness dependent on the spatial scale or on the characteristics of the species group?\n\u25a0\tWe hypothesized that (iii) at multi-habitat scales, species richness is better explained by multi-habitat species-area models, namely the countryside model, which considers both the effect of area and the effect of habitat composition on species richness, than by the classic species-area model, which only considers area, and that (iv) the countryside model will better fit species-area data when species groups show a differential use of habitats (i.e., do not use the landscape homogeneously).\n2.\tMETHODS\n2.1.\tStudy area\nThe Iberian Peninsula was selected as the study area (Fig. 1). The Macaronesic territories (Madeira, Azores and Canary Islands), the Balearic Islands and the Spanish territories located in the Northern Africa were excluded from the analyses. The Iberian Peninsula has an area of 580,456 Km and is located in the Mediterranean Basin in southwestern Europe and includes the countries of Spain and Portugal. It is bordered on the southeast and east by the Mediterranean Sea and on the north, west and southwest by the Atlantic Ocean. The Pyrenees mountains, in the northeast edge of the peninsula, separate it from the rest of Europe.\nThe Iberian Peninsula intersects two large biogeographic regions: Mediterranean and Atlantic. The Mediterranean region encompasses almost the entire surface of Spain and Portugal and is characterized by warm to hot, dry summers with a lengthy period of drought. The Atlantic region includes territories located along the coastland of northern Portugal and northern Spain, and is characterized by cold winters and lack of a distinct dry season. The elevation ranges from sea level to 3478m, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from values below 2.5 \u00b0C in areas of highest altitude, namely the Pyrenees in Spain, to temperatures higher than 17 \u00b0C in southeast Spain. Mean annual precipitation shows a large spatial variability, with the highest values above 2,200 mm and usually in mountain areas, and the lowest values being below 300 mm in the southeast of Spain. Monthly average rainfall has a significant seasonality in the southern half of the Peninsula and less variation in the northwest region of the Peninsula (AEMet and IM, 2011).\nVegetation and land-use are conditioned by topographic and climatic variability, varying from semi-desertic flora, grassland, shrubland and steppe-land areas, to evergreen pine forest, Mediterranean oak forests (including dehesas featuring mainly evergreen oaks such as holm oaks, Quercus ilex, and cork oaks, Quercus suber), deciduous forests and sub-alpine and alpine vegetation. Interconnecting all these habitats we can find vast mosaics of farming areas.\n2.2.\tLand-cover and Environmental data\nWe mapped land-cover for Iberia by combining the Land Cover database COS'90 (IGP, 1990) of Portugal and the database from the Second Spanish National Forest Inventory IFN2 (MARM, 1998). The full COS database and IFN2 land cover legend is available through the Portuguese\nFig. 1. Geographic location of the Iberian Peninsula (top right and central map).The bottom right figure\nrepresents the different UTM scales considered in our work (from right to left): 5885 cells 10 x 10Km, 261\ncells 50 x 50Km, 90 cells 100 x 100Km and 29 cells 200 x 200Km.\nGeographical Institute and Spanish Ministry of Environment web sites (respectively, http://www.igeo.pt/instituto/cegig/got/3 Docs/Files/Nery 2007ed FontesPrimariasCLCCOS.pdf and\thttp://www.marm.es/es/biodiversidad/servicios/banco-de-datos-\nbiodiversidad/explicaciones y m%C3%A9todos tcm7-171562.pdf).\tLand-cover classes were\ngrouped into four main categories: agricultural land, uncultivated land, forest and exotic forest (Fig.2; see Table 1 for more details). Water bodies, rocky areas, human-dominated areas (e.g., urban fabric, quarries, green urban areas, etc.) and unclassified land cover were excluded from the analyses.\nWe intersected the land-cover map with the UTM 10x10 grid, and selected only with grid cells that had more than 25% cover in any of the four classes above, resulting in a final set of 5885 cells of 10 Km x 10 Km (cells dropped from the analysis include gap cells in the original land-cover products, cells in urban areas, and cells along the edge of the peninsula). The presence and the percentage cover of each habitat in each cell was calculated using ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, 2009). For\nClimatic variables were obtained from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) TS 1.2 dataset (Mitchell et al. 2003). Information on average monthly temperature, DTR (i.e., Diurnal temperature range) and annual precipitation were extracted and resampled on a 10x10 km cell size. Elevation, aspect and slope data came from the United States Geological Survey HYDRO 1k digital terrain model (USGS, 2000).\nIn order to avoid multicolinearity, all predictors were previously tested for pairwise correlations using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Predictors with correlation higher than 0.7 were removed from the analysis (Elith et al., 2006, Wisz and Guisan, 2009).\nTable 1\nThe land-use classification used in the study.\nAggregated land use category\tOriginal land use category for Portugal\tOriginal land use category for Spain\nAgriculture land (AG)\tArable land, annual crops, permanent crops, heterogeneous agricultural areas, olive grove, vineyard, orchard, other shrubs, permanent grassland, agroforestry areas (where agriculture area dominate).\tAgriculture land\nUncultivated land (UL)\tPoor rangeland, low shrub, sclerophyllous vegetation, high shrub and degraded or transition forest, uncovered areas with little or no vegetation, abandoned olive grove, recently burned areas.\tLand with scrub species and / or natural grassland or weak human intervention, pasture or grass mixed with brush, scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation associations, open spaces with little or no vegetation.\nForest (F)\tQuercus ilex, Quercus suber, Quercus sp. , Castanea sativa, Pinus pinea, Pinus pinaster, other brodleaf and coniferous species.\tQuercus sp, Olea european, Fagus sylvatica, Myrica faya, Castanea sativa, Populous nigra, Juniperus thurifera, Abies alba, Pinus sp, mixed pine species, mixed hardwood species,mixed oak species, other coniferous and broadleaf species.\nExotic forest (EF)\tEucalyptus sp.\tEucalyptus sp.\nFig.2. Landcover map of Iberian Peninsula\n13\n2.3.\tSpecies distribution\nWe collected presence/absence data on the distribution of 399 vertebrate species from Spanish and Portuguese distribution atlases based on UTM cells of 10 x 10 Km: 306 common breeding birds (Equipa Atlas 2008; Loureiro et al 2008), 59 reptiles and 34 amphibians (Pleguezuelos et al. 2002; Marti and Moral 2003).\nWe selected 82 passerine species among the breeding birds database due to their high diversity and presence in most ecological niches, which makes them a good model to explore species responses to landscape changes (Polo and Carrascal, 2001). Habitat preferences of passerine species living in the Iberian Peninsula (i.e., excluding islands) were obtained from literature (Pleguezuelos et al., 2002; Marti and Moral, 2003; Equipa Atlas, 2008; Catry et al., 2010) and from expert knowledge. Species were then divided in three groups according to those preferences: agricultural land species, uncultivated land species, and forest species. Only species present in a least 10 study units (i.e., UTM 10 x 10 Km cell) were used in the analysis.\n2.4.\tData analysis\nWe mapped the species richness of amphibians, reptiles and passerine birds and of agricultural land passerine species, uncultivated land passerine species and forest passerine species (Fig. 3). We used the Spearman's rho to test the association between single environmental variables (described in Table 2) and the richness of each taxa. The relative importance of the different environmental factors was assessed through multi-model selection. Three types of models were tested (Table 2): (1) models with only one type of environmental predictors (i.e., climatic, topographic and habitat), (2) models with two types of predictors (i.e., climatic plus topographic, climatic plus habitat and topographic plus habitat), and (3) all predictors together. For all models the dependent variable was species richness. Models were compared using the Akaike's Information Criterion:\nAIC = \u20142 In (L m) + 2p\nwhere Lm is the maximum likelihood of the model, p is the number of free parameters of the model (Sakamoto et al. 1986).\nWe test the effect of habitat heterogeneity on species richness using Spearman's rho and with visual analyses of boxplots. Due to the original structure of the landcover datasets, only data from\nRMSE =\nWe assessed the fit of the classic SAR and the countryside SAR to the species richness in each group, from the 10x10km scale to the entire Iberia, using the intermediate cell sizes 50 x 50 Km , 100 x 100 Km and 200 x 200 Km . The models were fit to data by non-linear regression (Rosenzweig, 1995), choosing the fit with the lowest SSE (i.e., Sum of Squares error). Parameters c and z were estimated for both models, and affinities hy were estimated for countryside-SARs. Models were compared using the Akaike's Information Criterion (Sakamoto et al. 1986) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):\nSEE n \u2014 k\nRMSE is a measure of fit that gives the standard deviation of the model prediction error, where n is the number o data points and k is the number of parameters in the model.

The group of forest species was the richest with 32 species (39.0%), followed by the uncultivated land group with 31 species (37.8%), and the agricultural land group with 19 species (23,2%). We excluded from the analysis the species associated with wetlands and coastal habitats (e.g., Acrocephalus scirpaceus), the species specially associated with urban habitats (e.g., Passer domesticus} and three ubiquitous species. The complete species list is presented in Appendix I.\nThe distribution of species in the Iberian Peninsula is not homogeneous (Fig. 3). While particular areas are consistently associated with high richness of species for the different taxa (amphibians, reptiles, passerines, and passerine species groups), the particular pattern of richness is somehow taxon specific. The areas with higher number of amphibians species are concentrated in the western portion of the Mediterranean biogeographic region across Galicia, and in the Central mountain range (Fig.3). The areas of high species richness for reptiles are mainly located in the southern part of Spain and the central region of Iberia (i.e., Central mountain range and Extremadura). Considering all passerine species, species seems to be concentrated in particular regions, mainly high/moderate altitude areas across the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula (Fig.3).\n3.1.\tCorrelation between species and environmental predictors\nTable 3 shows the correlation of species richness of amphibians, reptiles and the different passerine groups, with each environmental predictor. The richness of amphibians is negatively related with the area of agricultural land (rho=-0.28, p<0.001) and positively related with native and exotic forest (rho=0.34 and rho=0.32, p<0.001). In addition, amphibian diversity presents a slightly negative correlation with altitude and with daily temperature fluctuations, and a positive correlation with precipitation. The richness of reptiles shows a similar pattern to that of amphibians regarding the preference of habitats: it is positively correlated with native forest area (rho=0.23, p<0.001), and negatively correlated with agricultural areas (rho=-0.26, p<0.001). Regarding climatic and topography predictors, reptiles exhibit the same patterns as amphibians.\nPasserine species richness increased with altitude (rho=0.21-0.48, p<0.001), and decreased with mean daily temperature in July.. In relation to land use predictors, the richness of passerine affinity groups showed a correlation with the area of their preferred habitat (e.g., forest species occur more in areas of forest, rho=0.58, p<0.001, and agriculture species are richer in areas of agriculture\nTable 3\nValues of correlation (rho) between taxa richness and climatic, topographic and habitat predictors (* P &lt;0.05, ** P &lt;0.01, *** P &lt;0.001).See Table 2 for predictors legend.\n\tAmphibians\tReptiles\tPasserine birds\tAgriculture passerine sp.\tUncultivated land passerine sp.\tForest passerine sp.\nDmt.jul\t-0.13***\t0.01\t-0.56***\t-0.09\t-0.51***\t-0.64***\nDtr.jul\t-0.25***\t-0.24***\t-0.10***\t0.15***\t-0.03\t-0.26***\nPre.ann\t0.41***\t0.21***\t0.26***\t-0.20***\t0.13***\t0.50***\nAlt.mea\t-0.17***\t-0.12***\t0.48***\t0.21***\t0.48***\t0.43***\nAsp.N\t-0 04***\t-0.01\t0.05***\t0.01**\t0.06***\t0.03\nAsp.S\t0.04*\t-0.04*\t-0.03***\t-0.06***\t-0.05\t0.02\nAsp.E\t0.06***\t0.12***\t0 07***\t0.05***\t0.04\t0.08***\nAsp.W\t-0.02*\t-0.06***\t-0.06***\t-0.05\t-0.04**\t-0.06***\nAgr.sum\t-0.28***\t-0.26***\t-0 29***\t0.12***\t-0.13***\t-0.51***\nUnc.sum\t0.01\t0.13***\t0.21***\t0.02***\t0.21***\t0.24***\nFor.sum\t0.34***\t0.23***\t0.36***\t-0.01***\t0.13***\t0.58***\nExo.sum\t0.32***\t0.08***\t-0.27***\t-0.26***\t-0.33***\t-0.11**\n3.2.\tMultiple regressions between species and sets of environmental predictors\nConsidering the first set of models (MC, MT, MH), amphibians responded equally to climate and topographic predictors (r=0.18, p<0.001) (Table 4), while reptiles responded more to topography (r =0.14, p<0.001). Nevertheless, in both cases the variance explained by the predictors is low. All groups of passerines reacted primarily to climate predictors (r =0.21-0.40, p<0.001).\nWhen the set of predictors were tested in pairs (MTC, MCH, MTH), the amphibians responded best to the combination of climatic and habitat predictors (r =0.25, p<0.001), while reptiles responded equally to all three combinations of predictors (r=0.18, p<0.001). Total passerine diversity had the highest fit to the combination of climatic and habitat predictors (r =0.41, p<0.001). Forest species richness was also better explained by the combination of climatic and habitat variables, but the richness of agricultural land species were best explain by the model combining climatic and topographic predictors (r =0.26 and r =0.39,&lt;0.001).\nOverall climate predictors explained most of the variance, while habitat predictors contributed to improve the fit of the models.\n3.3.\tCorrelation between species and heterogeneity\nAll groups showed a positive correlation with landscape heterogeneity, that is, with the increase in the number of land uses (Fig. 4; Table 5). Passerine forest species showed the highest correlation (r= 0.44, p<0.001), while agricultural land species had the weakest response to landscape heterogeneity (r=0.06, p<0.001).\nTable 5\nCorrelations between richness and habitat heterogeneity, in a 10 Km x 10 Km cells.

SARs of all species groups had z-values (0.10 &lt;z &lt;0.16) characteristic of mainland species-area-curves (Fig 5; Rosenzweig 1995, Crawley &amp; Harral 2001). The affinities of agricultural, uncultivated, and forest species, as estimated by countryside-SAR, had maximum values in the respective preferred habitat (h=1). Species groups of open habitats (i.e., agriculture and uncultivated species) show moderate affinity to others habitats. The forest groups present low (h&lt;0.01) and very low (h&lt;0.00001) affinity for uncultivated and agriculture land, respectively.\nTable 6\nMulti-habitat species-area relationships of species groups and total species using the classic model (SAR) and the countryside model (C.SAR). A total of 6225 points, including all scales, were used in the analysis. Parameters hAL, hUL, and hF represent the affinity of the species groups for agriculture land, uncultivated land and forest respectively. The countryside species-area relationship for total species is expressed by the sum of species-area relationships of species groups.

Our results suggest that at the regional scale climate is the principal determinant of species richness, although habitat still plays a role in most species groups. This suggests that the relative importance of climate and habitat structure in controlling species richness varies with scale (Rahbek and Graves, 2001; van Rensburg et al., 2002; Hurlbert and Haskell, 2003).\nThe diversity of the different taxonomic groups exhibited a positive response to habitat heterogeneity, although of different intensities.\nThe variety of responses of taxa to landscape heterogeneity may be related to the scale at which these groups perceive the landscape. Species use structural characteristics of the habitat that occur on a specific scale, reflecting important habitat requirements such as escape from predation, foraging or reproduction requirements (Keitt et al, 1997; Mazerolle and Villard, 1999; Atuari and Lucio, 2001; Gil-Tena et al., 2007; Desroches et al 2011). Thus, the presence or quality of these specific structures in a given area can be determinant for increasing species diversity of certain taxa. The high correlation of amphibians with habitat heterogeneity can be indicator of the presence of these \u201ckeystone structures\u201d, since most of the landuse classes used in this analyses were forest habitats, where amphibians are more likely to occupy water bodies (Guerry and Hunter Jr., 2002; Herrmann et al., 2004). The structure of the database used in this study may have also influenced the results, since the landcover information was more detailed towards forest habitats due to its original use in the context of the Spanish forest inventory. The strong response of forest birds to habitat heterogeneity is likely explained by their specialization to the different forest types. This bias in the database may also explain the low response of agricultural passerines and uncultivated land passerine to habitat heterogeneity: from a list of 58 habitats only 2 habitats represent the diversity of open land areas (see Appendix II). Although, is well know that some specific agricultural practices, like intensive agriculture, reduce the heterogeneity of the landscape (Benton et al, 2003), studies have highlight the capacity of agricultural species to use different agricultural habitats (Benton et al, 2003; Baldi and Batary, 2011), and surrounding habitats (i.e., forest, open areas, urban areas, etc.) (Herzon and O'Hara, 2007).\nAlmost all species groups showed a positive response to forest area and a negative response with agricultural area, suggesting that even in the context of a region with a long history of human use, some species seem to avoid human-dominated habitats. Forest bird species seems to be particularly susceptible to the structure of the their habitat (Diaz et al., 1998;Trzcinski et al., 1999).. Changes in agricultural practices throughout the last century let to an increase of homogeneous patches (Krebs et al, 2001), mainly due to agriculture intensification and forestry policies, creating unsuitable habitats for birds breeding (Diaz et al., 1998; Donald et al., 2001; Benton et al, 2003).\nIn summary, although climate is shown as the main factor affecting the richness of species groups studied in the Iberian Peninsula, habitat heterogeneity and habitat structure can be determinant. Species diversity increases with the number of landcover classes, perhaps because a greater number of landcover classes (habitats) is capable of satisfying the needs of different species (Atuari and Lucio, 2001; Tews et al., 2004; Desrochers et al., 2010).\n4.2.\tEffect of area and habitat diversity on species richness\nWe evaluated the performance of the countryside SAR, at the regional scale, against the performance of the classic SAR when predicting species-area patterns in a multi-habitat landscapes. Species richness of each of the species groups and the total number of species were best described using the countryside SAR.\nThe species-area relationship has been applied in the conservation context to predict species richness declines as natural area is converted to human dominated land covers (Sala et al., 2005; Desrochers et al, 2011). This approach is based on the assumption that the transformed landscape is completely uninhabitable. Yet in many situations habitat change does not translate into loss of inhabitable habitat. The conversion of natural cover could introduce new habitat types and allow generalist species to occur (Desrochers et al, 2011). Furthermore, the progressive conversion of small amounts of natural area can lead to a habitat that is more heterogeneous, which could lead to an increase in species richness at the local scale.\nSpecies will not use only their preferred habitat, but instead use alternative habitats when needed,. Still, the benefits that species accrue from the different habitats may not be detected in small scale studies (Jones, 2011). For instance, the relationship between several agricultural birds species and arable land depends on the proportion of arable land in a given region (Gates and Donald, 2001).\nIn order to investigate the effect of scale, we compared our results with the studies performed by Proenga (2009), and by Guilherme (2009) with plants and birds, respectively, in a mountain parish in northern Portugal. Both studies found that the species richness of species groups and of total species were best described using the countryside SAR. In addition, in both studies, all groups of species also showed a higher affinity for their preferred habitat. In contrast with our results, all species groups at the local scale had very low affinities for the alternative habitats, especially in the case of plants. At the regional scale, only forest species had very low affinity to the alternative habitats, which may be result of their specialist use of habitats. Forest species appear to be more dependent of their preferred habitat and less able to use alternative habitats independent of the scale. On the other hand, agricultural species showed relatively high affinity to non-agricultural habitats. Many studies have highlighted the importance of these habitats in maintaining agriculture biodiversity, by providing nesting and foraging habitats (Hinsley and Bellamy, 2000; Herzon and O'Hara, 2007). These facts suggest that, at larger scales, we are more likely to find non-forest habitat specialist outside their preferred habitats.\nThe results presented in this study confirm the countryside SAR as an improved model, with easy empirical application, to assess species-area patterns in a multi-habitat landscapes. In the last decade there have been other attempts to create a multi-habitat species-area model. Tjorve (2002) proposed a framework to build species-area models by combining specie-area curves for different habitat.,He explored the effect of the size and number of habitats, but he did not explore the way that different species may perceive the different habitats. The choros model proposed by Triantis et al. (2003), combines the total effect of area and habitat diversity to determine the regional species richness. The variable area is replaced by the variable choros, which arises as the result of the multiplication of the number of different habitats in an area by the size of that area. Yet, like Tjorve's model, this model does not consider the possibility of differential use of habitats by different species. The countryside SAR considers the differential use of habitats by different species groups, and accounts for the area and number of habitats, and so it is more appropriate for applications when projections of biodiversity responses to land-use changes are needed.\nCONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS\nOur results indicate that the distribution of vertebrate species richness in Iberian Peninsula is related to different factors depending on the taxonomic class considered. Areas that have high value to some taxon may be inadequate for others (Rey-Benayas and Montana, 2003). A better understanding of the relationships between different environmental and geographic factors and species richness may help determine the most effective locations to establish new conservation areas or to allocate funds.\nThe countryside-SAR provided a new model to understand fauna distribution on the Iberian Peninsula. Multi-habitat models are nowadays essential tools to assess species responses to changing landscapes.\nConservation strategies for sustaining biodiversity must consider that species richness and ecological processes are controlled by parameters operating at a wide array of scales\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nTo the lab group, I'm very grateful to have had such a group of friends and colleagues, supporting me and challenging me during this journey.\nParticularly thanks to my friends, the joes's and In\u00eas's, you know how you are, and the \u201cmargem sul\u201d crew.\nFinally, I would like to thanks to my family for their support, even if was knowing when to leave me alone to stress!\nREFERENCES\nArrhenius, O.1921.
