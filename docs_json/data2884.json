Esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o foca-se nos 20 pa\u00edses com a maior produ\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade atrav\u00e9s de energias renov\u00e1veis, e usa uma base de dados de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas de apoio \u00e0s renov\u00e1veis desde 1971. Al\u00e9m disso, este estudo usa um per\u00edodo de tempo desde 1990 at\u00e9 2014, sendo poss\u00edvel capturar os efeitos das pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas e dos drivers que promovem a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de energias renov\u00e1veis na sua fase de arranque. Esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o contribui para a literatura devido a avaliar os efeitos das pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade e na capacidade instalada das fontes renov\u00e1veis, agregadas e desagregadas pelas novas fontes de energias renov\u00e1vel. As caracter\u00edsticas dos dados em painel exigem a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do estimador Driscoll-Kraay com efeitos fixos. Os resultados enfatizam que a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o das fontes de energia renov\u00e1vel foi estabelecida essencialmente por pol\u00edticas de incentivos financeiros e fiscais (policy-driven). No entanto, as pol\u00edticas orientadas para estimular e regular o mercado (market-driven) demonstram ser eficientes na promo\u00e7\u00e3o das energias renov\u00e1veis.\nPalavras-chave\nPol\u00edticas P\u00fablicas de Apoio \u00e0s Renov\u00e1veis, Fontes de Energia Renov\u00e1vel, Efeitos Din\u00e2micos de Painel, Estimador Driscoll-Kraay\nResumo Alargado\nAs pol\u00edticas de apoio \u00e0s renov\u00e1veis (PPAR) s\u00e3o essenciais para lidar com as falhas no mercado de energia. Na verdade, as tecnologias de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade atrav\u00e9s de combust\u00edveis fosseis n\u00e3o internalizam no seu pre\u00e7o os custos de polui\u00e7\u00e3o. \u00c9 fundamental, nos sistemas electroprodutores, a mudan\u00e7a da sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade atrav\u00e9s de combust\u00edveis fosseis para a explora\u00e7\u00e3o das fontes de energia renov\u00e1vel (FER), para preservar o meio ambiente e para reduzir a depend\u00eancia externa das fontes de eletricidade. Como \u00e9 sabido, as FER implicam um grande investimento na sua fase inicial, devido \u00e0 falta de progresso tecnol\u00f3gico e \u00e0 insufici\u00eancia de know-how. Devido aos novos desenvolvimentos, as novas FER aumentaram a sua competitividade, ainda que as mesmas necessitem de interven\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica. Apesar de alguns estudos emp\u00edricos recentes (por exemplo Aguirre and Ibikunle, 2014; Marques and Fuinhas, 2012; Polzin et al., 2015), a literatura que foca a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as PPAR e a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de FER nos sistemas electroprodutores \u00e9 essencialmente qualitativa e normativa ( por exemplo Abdmouleh et al., 2015; Gan et al., 2007), revelando um impacto positivo das PPAR na implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de FER. Contudo, a literatura emp\u00edrica (por exemplo Aguirre and Ibikunle, 2014; Marques and Fuinhas, 2012; Polzin et al., 2015) demonstra que as categorias e subcategorias das PPAR t\u00eam diferentes efeitos na implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de FER nos sistemas electroprodutores. Por conseguinte, as conclus\u00f5es alcan\u00e7adas pela literatura est\u00e3o longe de ser consensuais.\nA avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das consequ\u00eancias das PPAR \u00e9 crucial, dado que os governos t\u00eam de cumprir e satisfazer m\u00faltiplos objetivos. Por um lado, os governos devem manter e aumentar a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de FER nos sistemas electroprodutores nacionais. Por outro lado, os governos t\u00eam que implementar incentivos para aumentar a implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de FER, e que os mesmos exijam menos recursos provenientes da economia. Visto que esses incentivos podem comprometer o crescimento econ\u00f3mico como citado por alguns autores (por exemplo Al-mulali et al., 2014; Cowan et al., 2014; Marques and Fuinhas, 2015). Consequentemente, o equil\u00edbrio desses objetivos \u00e9 essencial na conce\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edticas de energia adequadas, e esta \u00e9 a principal motiva\u00e7\u00e3o para esta pesquisa. Por conseguinte, esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o tem como objetivo prestar apoio, bem como discuss\u00e3o sobre a conce\u00e7\u00e3o e implementa\u00e7\u00e3o adequada das PPAR para a implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de FER, nos sistemas electroprodutores.\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o utiliza um painel de dados anuais sobre os 20 pa\u00edses com a maior produ\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade atrav\u00e9s de FER, e um intervalo de tempo desde 1990 at\u00e9 2014. Tendo como objetivo a an\u00e1lise, atrav\u00e9s de uma abordagem din\u00e2mica, dos efeitos das PPAR, nas suas diversas categorias e subcategorias, na capacidade instalada e na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade atrav\u00e9s das\nFER, num formato agregado, e desagregadas pelas novas FER, nomeadamente a energia e\u00f3lica e a solar fotovoltaica. Afim de avaliar a efici\u00eancia das PPAR na implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de FER nos sistemas electroprodutores, fornecendo orienta\u00e7\u00f5es para a conce\u00e7\u00e3o e afina\u00e7\u00e3o das PPAR, capazes de introduzir uma l\u00f3gica de mercado e a autossustentabilidade das FER. Por um lado, os efeitos das PPAR na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade e na capacidade instalada ser\u00e3o avaliados em compara\u00e7\u00e3o. A fim de analisar se quando as PPAR t\u00eam um impacto positivo na capacidade instalada esse se traduz num aumento de gera\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade atrav\u00e9s das FER. Por outro lado, ser\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m avaliados em compara\u00e7\u00e3o os efeitos das PPAR no formato agregado das FER, na energia e\u00f3lica e no solar fotovoltaico, a fim de analisar se as mesmas t\u00eam efeitos espec\u00edficos para as diversas tecnologias de explora\u00e7\u00e3o das FER.\nForam aplicados v\u00e1rios testes de especifica\u00e7\u00e3o aos modelos, nomeadamente, de exist\u00eancia de efeitos de painel, de presen\u00e7a de efeitos individuais contra efeitos aleat\u00f3rios, de heterocedasticidade, de auto correla\u00e7\u00e3o de primeira ordem, de depend\u00eancia de sec\u00e7\u00e3o transversal e de heterogeneidade do painel de dados. Como observado pelos testes de especifica\u00e7\u00e3o, o estimador Driscoll and Kraay com efeitos fixos e a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo ARDL (autoregressive distributed lag) demonstraram-se adequados para lidar com o painel de dados. Em geral, todos os modelos suportam a cointegra\u00e7\u00e3o, dado que o mecanismo e corre\u00e7\u00e3o de erro \u00e9 negativo e significante a 1%. Na verdade, este estudo enfatiza a relev\u00e2ncia da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo ARDL, separando os efeitos, em efeitos de curto e de longo prazo. Do mesmo modo, a robustez dos resultados \u00e9 real\u00e7ada atrav\u00e9s das elevadas elasticidades observadas, devido \u00e0s mesmas serem compat\u00edveis com a fase de arranque, o per\u00edodo em analise, da implementa\u00e7\u00e3o das FER. Em suma, os resultados mostram que os investimentos diretos, os instrumentos regulat\u00f3rios e as abordagens volunt\u00e1rias foram ineficazes na promo\u00e7\u00e3o das FER nos sistemas electroprodutores. No entanto, os incentivos financeiros e fiscais, os instrumentos baseados no mercado e as pol\u00edticas de informa\u00e7\u00e3o e educa\u00e7\u00e3o foram eficazes na implementa\u00e7\u00e3o das FER nos sistemas electroprodutores.\nA literatura n\u00e3o \u00e9 consensual na discuss\u00e3o dos diversos efeitos dos incentivos financeiros e fiscais. Todavia, os resultados, desta categoria de PPAR, demonstrados nesta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o o s\u00e3o. No entanto, \u00e9 de destacar os efeitos das tarifas feed-in e das pol\u00edticas de benef\u00edcios fiscais na implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de energia solar fotovoltaica e e\u00f3lica, respetivamente. De facto, as tarifas feed-in est\u00e3o em linha com a prefer\u00eancia dos investidores, garantindo-lhes um pre\u00e7o fixo e prioridade de despacho para a eletricidade gerada. Do mesmo modo esta subcategoria de incentivos financeiros e fiscais juntamente com as pol\u00edticas de empr\u00e9stimos, estimularam os consumidores a serem produtores, atrav\u00e9s da instala\u00e7\u00e3o de pain\u00e9is fotovoltaicos em suas casas. Contrariamente, os projetos de energia e\u00f3lica implicam um grande investimento inicial, e as redu\u00e7\u00f5es e isen\u00e7\u00f5es fiscais s\u00e3o as pol\u00edticas que mais t\u00eam aumentado a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de energia e\u00f3lica. Em virtude destes resultados demonstrados podemos concluir que as PPAR t\u00eam efeitos distintos nas FER. Todavia, os incentivos financeiros e fiscais dependem\ndiretamente dos or\u00e7amentos p\u00fablicos, por conseguinte, esta depend\u00eancia pode implicar uma carga excessiva para as economias. Contrariamente, as pol\u00edticas orientadas para o mercado e os instrumentos regulat\u00f3rios, nomeadamente aqueles que incorporam os Renewable Standard Portfolio, t\u00eam um efeito positivo na implementa\u00e7\u00e3o das FER. Na verdade, estas abordagens n\u00e3o garantem um pre\u00e7o fixo, mas imp\u00f5em limites m\u00ednimos na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade atrav\u00e9s de FER e limites m\u00e1ximos nas emiss\u00f5es de di\u00f3xido de carbono. Sendo que o pre\u00e7o dos mesmos \u00e9 delineado pela oferta e pela procura de mercado. De tal forma que, as pol\u00edticas orientadas para o mercado t\u00eam impulsionado a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de FER nos sistemas electroprodutores e aumentado a competitividade das mesmas no mercado da energia.\nEm suma, os instrumentos orientados para o mercado e os incentivos fiscais, conjuntamente, t\u00eam impulsionado a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o da energia solar fotovoltaica. Mas, a promo\u00e7\u00e3o da energia e\u00f3lica apenas tem sido realizada atrav\u00e9s de investimentos diretos dos governos e incentivos financeiros e fiscais. De tal forma que, estas pol\u00edticas podem ter aumentado a press\u00e3o sobre as economias e ter um influencia negativa no mercado de energia, dado que o pre\u00e7o da eletricidade gerada atrav\u00e9s da energia e\u00f3lica \u00e9 independente do pre\u00e7o de eletricidade do mercado. Os resultados provam que um mix de pol\u00edticas orientadas para o mercado e incentivos financeiros e fiscais t\u00eam aumentado a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o da energia solar fotovoltaica nos sistemas electroprodutores. Consequentemente, os resultados sugerem que \u00e9 essencial ajustar as pol\u00edticas de mercado, para as mesmas tenham um efeito desejado na implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de energia e\u00f3lica. De modo que, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade atrav\u00e9s de energia e\u00f3lica diminua o seu custo de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o e aumente a sua competitividade no mercado de eletricidade.\nviii\nAbstract\nThe design of energy policies, namely those focused on supporting renewable energy sources is crucial for facing the major challenge of combining economic growth and sustainable development. This paper focuses on the 20 countries with the highest electricity production from renewables, and uses a database of policies since 1971. In addition, this paper uses a time-span from 1990 until 2014, which makes it possible to capture the effects of public policies and the drivers that promote renewable energy implementation, in its take-off phase. The paper contributes to the literature by assessing the effects of public policies supporting renewables on both aggregated renewable sources and individual new renewables. Moreover, it contributes by appraising how public policies are influencing both electricity generation and the installed capacity of renewable sources. The characteristics of the panel data require the use of the Driscoll-Kraay estimator with fixed effects to handle them. The results emphasize that the implementation of renewable energy sources has been established essentially by policy-drivers, but that market-drivers are able to promote renewable energy deployment.\nKeywords\nPublic Policies Supporting Renewables, Renewable Energy, panel dynamic effects, Driscoll-Kraay estimator.\nx\nIndex\n1.\tIntroduction\t1\n2.\tPolicies to promote RES implementation\t4\n3.\tData and methodology\t11\n4.\tResults and discussion\t16\n5.\tConclusions\t21\nReferences\t23\nAppendix\t27\nxii\nFigures list\nFigure 1. - Installed capacities of renewables energies sources excluding hydro in Megawatts\nFigure 2. - Installed capacity of RES and public policies supporting renewables\nFigure 3. - RES use and public policies supporting renewables.\nFigure 4. - Summary of the estimated effects on wind power of the PPSR and the other drivers\nFigure 5 - Summary of the estimated effects on solar PV of the PPSR and the other drivers\nxiv\nTables List\nTable 1. - PPSR categorization of Global Energy Policies and Measures\nTable 2. - Data: definition, sources and descriptive statistics\nTable 3. - Cross section dependence test\nTable 4. - Specification tests\nTable 5. - Elasticities and adjustment speed\nTable A.1. - Unit root tests\nTable A.2.1. - Correlation matrices with variables in level\nTable A.2.2. - Correlation matrices with variables in level\nTable A.3.1.\nTable A.3.2.\n- Correlation matrices with variables in first differences\n- Correlation matrices with variables in first differences\nTable A.4. - Estimation results\nTable A.5. -- Estimation results of RES_EG model\nTable A.6. - Estimation results of RES_IC model\nTable A.7. - Estimation results of WIND_EG model\nTable A.8. - Estimation results of WIND_IC model\nTable A.9. - Estimation results of SOLPV EG model\nTable A.10. - Estimation results of SOLPV_IC model\nxvi\nAcronyms list\nGRP\tGabinete de Rela\u00e7\u00f5es P\u00fablicas\nUBI\tUniversidade da Beira Interior\nPPAR\tPol\u00edticas de Apoio \u00e1s Renov\u00e1veis\nFER\tFontes de Energia Renov\u00e1vel\nARDL\tAutoregressive Distributed Lag\nPPSR\tPublic Policies Supporting Renewables\nRES\tRenewable Energy Sources\nPV\tPhotovoltaic\nIEA\tInternational Energy Agency\nDI\tDirect Investment\nFFI\tFiscal/Financial Incentives\nMBI\tMarket-based Instruments\nINFE\tInformation and Education\nPS\tPolicy Support\nRDD\tResearch, Development and Deployment\nVA\tVoluntary Approaches\nRI\tRegulatory Instruments\nDI_PR\tProcurement Rules\nDI_II\tInfrastructure Investment\nDI_FSG\tFunds to Sub-national Governments\nFFI_FTP\tFeed-in Tariffs/Premiums\nFFI_GS\tGrants and Subsidies\nFFI_L\tLoans\nFFI_T\tTaxes\nFFI_TR\tTax Relief\nRI_CS\tCodes and Standards\nRI_OS\tObligation Schemes\nRI_OMR\tOther Mandatory Requirements\nRPS\tRenewable Standard Portfolio\nKGOE\tKilograms of oil equivalent\nMW\tMegawatts\nMt\tMillion tonnes\nECM\tError Correction Mechanism\nVIF\tVariance Inflation Factor\nMG\tMean Group\nPMG\tPooled Mean Group\nDFE\tDynamic Fixed Effects\nFE\tFixed Effects\nRE\tRandom Effects\nxviii\nPublic Policies Supporting Renewables (PPSR) are designed mainly to deal with energy market failures. Indeed, it is well-known that, in general, fossil fuels do not incorporate pollution costs in their price. The shift from fossil fuels towards Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the domestic electricity mix is a major step in preserving the environment and reducing the external dependence of electricity sources. As is also well-known, RES imply a large amount of investment in their initial phase. The new renewable sources are already finding ways to make themselves competitive, but they need public intervention (Johnstone et al., 2010; Polzin et al., 2015).\nEvaluating the consequences of PPSR is clearly crucial, given that governments are attempting to meet multiple objectives. On the one hand, they must keep the deployment of RES within the domestic electricity mix. On the other hand, they have to find incentives that require fewer resources from the economy as a whole. In fact, these incentives may even compromise economic growth (Al-mulali et al., 2014; Cowan et al., 2014; Lin and Moubarak, 2014; Marques and Fuinhas, 2015). In short, the balance of these two factors is essential in designing appropriate energy policies, and this is the main motivation for this research. Therefore, this paper aims to provide support, as well as to discuss the appropriate design of PPSR for the deployment of renewables.\nDespite some recent empirical studies (e.g. Aguirre and Ibikunle, 2014; Marques and Fuinhas, 2012; Polzin et al., 2015), the literature focused on the relationship between PPSR and RES deployment is mainly qualitative and normative (e.g. Abdmouleh et al., 2015; Bird et al., 2005; Gan et al., 2007; Harmelink et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2013), and reveals a positive impact of PPSR on RES implementation. However, empirical literature (e.g. Aguirre and Ibikunle, 2014; Carley, 2009; Johnstone et al., 2010; Marques and Fuinhas, 2012; Menz and Vachon, 2006; Polzin et al., 2015) demonstrates differing effects of PPSR subcategories on RES deployment. Moreover, the conclusions reached by the literature are far from consensual. Therefore, this research uses an annual panel data based on the 20 countries with the highest electricity production using RES and a time span from 1990 until 2014. The policy framework and the economic resources of the countries under analysis are quite different. Accordingly, this panel allows assessing the level of renewables deployment in countries with both different frameworks of policies and diverse incentives to support renewable energies. In addition, the use of this time-span makes it possible to cover: (i) the oil price boom and the financial crisis; (ii) the take-off phase of implementing renewables; (iii) the most recent RES deployments and investments (from 2012 onward), stimulated by social and political pressure for the development of cleaner energies in the countries with the greatest investment in RES. The database of policy-related variables has been collected starting from the date of the first implemented policy, i.e., from 1971, thus allowing it to be considered more disaggregated.\nThe assessment of the apportionment of short- and long-run effects, thus provides a deeper understanding of the dynamic relationship between policies and RES deployment. Indeed, this apportionment is important for understanding the different effects of policy-based and marketbased factors on RES deployment. The main advantage of the policy-based approach is the long term certainty of receiving support, which may significantly reduce investment risk and create a basis for long term investment planning. In fact, the policy-based approach enables early market diffusion of less mature and more expensive technologies, through the differentiation of tariffs and reduction of taxes according to the RES technology supported. Consequently, the policy-based approach gives larger benefits to investors, i.e., it pays a higher-than-market price for the electricity generated. Therefore, this approach allows investors to cover their costs and earn a reasonable return on investments, while consumers have to pay a higher price for the electricity, directly or indirectly (through tax payments).\nIn contrast, the market-based approaches are oriented toward the markets, based on the interaction between the supply and demand of certificates and quota obligations. Indeed, this type of approach increases market competition for RES technologies, and encourages the expansion of the most efficient RES technologies. However, market imperfections can lead to markets only supporting lower-cost technologies, due to the price of green and white certificates, and quota obligations that are difficult to predict and that are determined by the most expensive technology sold in the market. Price uncertainty, including the possibility that it could be zero, leads to large capital losses for the investors. Indeed, the prices of marketbased instruments can lead to a higher risk level for investors, and consequently, to a lesser availability of capital for investments (Zamfir et al., 2016). In summary, market-based instruments appear to be less effective than policy-based approaches, but they can lead to the desired level of RES penetration on the market with greater cost efficiency. Nonetheless, policy-based instruments have successfully supported RES in the initial phases of their implementation, due to the low risk of investments.\nThe main objective of this paper is to analyse, though a dynamic approach, the effects of PPSR, in various categories and subcategories, on installed capacity and on electricity generation by RES in an aggregated format, and in a disaggregated format for new sources of renewable energies, namely wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV). Therefore, this paper makes it possible to assess the efficiency of PPSR and to provide guidelines to the design and fine-tuning of a PPSR mix capable of introducing market logic and self-sustainability for these sources of energy. On the one hand, the effects of PPSR on electricity production and on installed capacity will be evaluated in comparison, in order to analyse if, when PPSR has a positive impact on installed capacity, it also increases electricity generation. On the other hand, the effects of the PPSR on aggregated renewables, on wind power, and on solar PV will be assessed in comparison, in order to analyse the specific technological effects of PPSR.\nBoth panel data estimators and co-integration/long memory are pursued and discussed, specifically when dealing with the heterogeneity of the panel and the country specific effects. The comprehensive analysis of the impacts of PPSR on RES implementation requires an econometric technique that takes into consideration both short- and long-run effects, and the data requires the use of the Driscoll-Kraay estimator with fixed effects to handle the data features.\nThe analysis proves that PPSR stimulate the implementation of RES. However, technologically specific policies have differing effects on the deployment of wind power and solar PV. Carbon dioxide emissions proved to be an incentive to promote wind power. However, the intensity of fossil fuels on the economy is ineffective in promoting RES deployment.\nIn addition to this introduction, the remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 explains the role and definition of each category and subcategory of PPSR, as well a brief discussion of results in the literature. Section 3 presents the data and describes the methodology. Both the results and their interpretation are discussed in Section 4. Lastly, Section 5 presents the conclusions.\n2.Policies to promote RES implementation\nThis study uses the PPSR categorization of Global Energy Policies and Measures Data Base of International Energy Agency (IEA). Both their categories and subcategories are displayed and explained in Table 1. According to the IEA criteria, the categories of PPSR are: Direct Investment (DI); Fiscal/Financial Incentives (FFI); Market-based Instruments (MBI); Information and Education (INFE); Policy Support (PS); Research, Development and Deployment (RDD); Voluntary Approaches (VA); and Regulatory Instruments (RI).\nTable 1.

The most remarkable results are: (i) the positive influence of Renewable Standard Portfolio (RPS) policies on wind power and on the share of electricity generation through RES (Carley, 2009; Menz and Vachon, 2006); (ii) the dissimilar results of fiscal/financial incentives. Marques and Fuinhas (2012) found a positive influence on the contribution of renewables to energy supply, conversely, Aguirre and Ibikunle (2014) found a negative impact on the growth of renewables; and (iii) Polzin et al. (2015) used the FFI in their subcategories and found a positive influence for feed-in tariffs and premiums in adding to the installed capacity of wind power and solar PV, although, Johnstone et al. (2010) showed that feed-in tariffs have a negative impact on wind power patent activity, but, have a positive impact on solar PV patent activity.\nFrom 1990 until 2004 the increase of installed capacity of RES has been slow, because of the technologies development and the policies supporting renewables, an increase of installed capacities of RES has been noticeable from 2004 (see Fig. 1). Indeed, only since 2004 is distinguishable the strategy of each country to increase the exploitation of RES and reduce their energy dependence. Canada, China, Denmark, Spain, Finland, India, Mexico, Poland, Portugal and Sweden have deployed large amounts of installed capacity of wind power, but not have increased their installed capacity of solar PV. However, Australia, Belgium, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, United States have increased their installed capacity of both the wind power and solar PV, although, Belgium, Italy, Japan have increased more the Installed capacity of solar PV than the wind power.\nCanada\nChina\nDenmark\nGermany\nSpain\nFinland\nIndia\tItaly\nJapan\tMexico\nNetherlands\tPoland\n6,000 -r\n6,000 -r\n5,000 -\n5,000 -\n4,000 -\n4,000 -\n3,000 -\n3,000 -\n2,000 -\n2,000 -\n1,000-\n1,000-\n2005\nUnited States\n'' I \u2019\n1995\n0-^\n1990\n2000\nI 1\n1995\n0J ,\n1990\n2010\n1\t\u2018t-4\n2010\nInstalled capacity of RES excluding hydro Installed capacity of wind power\nInstalled capacity of solar PV\nFigure 1.

It can be observed an increase of public policies implemented to support the RES deployment, while it is observed the deployment of RES.\n1996\nCM .\n2004\ncm .\n\n\n\no\n\u2022 indgj^\t\u2022dnk\nnldmgbr\n\u2022prt \u2022\u2022sm^swifra\nfin\tebel\n\u2022pol\nCM -\n\u2022\tprt\n\u2022\tgbr\n5\t10\t15\t20\t25\t30\t35\t40\t45\t50\t55\nPPSR\nO -\n5\t10\t15\t20\t25\t30\t35\t40\t45\t50\t55\nPPSR\n\n2014\nFigure 2.

Indeed, Germany has a similar level of RES deployment of the United States, with fewer policies implemented and with a different strategy, increasing the implementation of both the wind power and the solar PV. However, China, since 2004 increased the number of PPSR, implemented, consequently, it went from countries group with a less installed capacity of RES for the group with more RES implementation. Furthermore, it is worth highlighted that the increased of PSSR number do not increase, similarly, the installed capacity of both the wind power and solar PV. Therefore, it can be concluded that countries apply the PPSR to a specific technology.\n2014\nFigure 3. RES use and public policies supporting renewables. Countries Australia (AUS), Belgium (BEL), Canada (CAN), China (CHN), Germany (DEU), Denmark (DEN), Spain (ESP), Finland (FIN), France (FRA), United kingdom (GBR), India (IND), Italy (ITA), Japan (JPN), Mexico (MEX), Netherlands (NLD), Poland (POL), Portugal (PRT), Sweden (SWE) and United States (USA).\nDue to the intermittency phenomenon, the installed capacity of RES cannot correspond to the effective generation capacity. Therefore, the necessity of study the PPSR effects in both the installed capacity and the capacity effectively used (electricity generated). Indeed, the Fig. 3. shows the PPSR for the level of use of RES, in 2014. After a visual inspection of Fig. 2 and 3, it can be concluded that the PPSR have a similar effect on the installed capacities of RES and on the electricity generation from RES.\nIn general, all countries have increased the RES deployment through PPSR implementation, but the figures also suggest that the explanation of both the installed capacity of RES and the electricity generation from RES must be assessed within a context of other drivers towards RES deployment.\n3.Data and methodology\nThis paper uses annual frequency data for a panel of countries, from the beginning of wind power and solar PV implementation (1990), until the last year for which the data is available (2014), thus it has used all available information. As stated before, the criteria for the selection of the countries is that their electricity production has the highest deployment of renewable sources, namely Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States1. We intend to assess the effects of PPSR when examining the RES in either an aggregated or disaggregated format for the new sources of generation. To do that, six models were carried out with the dependent variables indicated as follows:\n\u2022\tModel RES_EG - electricity generation through RES excluding hydro (DLGEG_RES);\n\u2022\tModel RES_IC - installed capacity of RES excluding hydro (DLCAP_RES);\n\u2022\tModel WIND_EG - electricity generation through wind power (DLGEG_WIND);\n\u2022\tModel WIND_IC - installed capacity of wind power (DLCAP_WIND);\n\u2022\tModel SOLPV_EG - electricity generation through solar PV (DLGEG_SOL);\n\u2022\tModel SOLPV_IC - installed capacity of solar PV (DLCAP_SOL).\nFollowing the literature, this paper controls the other drivers of RES and policy-related variables, as discussed below. Table 2 lists the definition of variables, sources and descriptive statistics. The prefixes \u201cL\u201d and \u201cD\u201d denote the natural logarithms and the first differences of logarithms, respectively.\nTable 2.

It is well-known that cross section dependence is a common occurrence. The Pesaran (2004) cross section dependence test, the CD-test (Table 3), was performed and strongly supports the presence of cross section dependence in all variables.\nTable 3.

Moreover, as a consequence of the CD-test results, the second generation unit root test CIPS (Pesaran, 2007) was also performed, as this test has the advantage of being robust in the presence of cross section dependence. The Table A.1 shows the first and second generation unit root tests. Accordingly, the CIPS test proves that all variables are I(1) in their levels, except for LGEG_WIND that could be a borderline I(0)/I(1), in accordance with the first generation unit root tests.\nIn pursuing the main objective of this paper, the dynamic analysis of PPSR effects on RES implementation, an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models has been used. The general ARDL model is specified as follows (eq. 1).\nAy# = %&amp; + (\u00bf1A0# +\t\"#_, + a2l\u00a3 dt_p + 0&amp;#,\t(1)\np=1\tp=1\nwhere Ay# is the vector of the dependent variables, A*# is the vector of the independent variables, (&amp;1 is the semi-elasticities, %1&amp; is the error correction mechanism (ECM), a2i is the elasticities, 0&amp;,# is the error term and is the intercept. Consequently, it becomes possible to breakdown the total effect into short- and long-run. Accordingly, the variables included in the models are in natural logarithms, and in first differences of logarithms, their coefficients are elasticities and semi-elasticities. Furthermore, this model is robust in the presence of variables I(0), I(1), or borderline. This feature allows variables with long memory patterns to be handled appropriately. Indeed, the literature shows that the ARDL model has consistent and efficient parameters estimates (Berk and Yetkiner, 2014; Fuinhas et al., 2015; Papageorgiou et al., 2016).\nBoth correlation of coefficients and the variance inflation factor (VIF) statistics were computed for all models. The low correlation values (see tables A.2 and A.3) and the low VIF statistics strongly support the idea that multicollinearity is far from being a concern in all models.\nThis being a macro panel with policy-related variables, best practices for econometric techniques suggest assessing the cross sectional heterogeneity of the panel. Both the Mean Group (MG) and Pooled Mean Group (PMG) were applied. Indeed, the MG estimator is the most flexible estimator if the long-run average coefficients are consistent, but it is inefficient where there is a slope of homogeneity (Shin et al., 1999).\nFollowing this, a battery of model specification tests were performed. Table 4 presents the tests: (i) the Breusch and Pagan LM test for random effects (Breusch, T. S. Pagan, 1980) to test the existence of panel effects; (ii) the modified Wald statistics for GroupWise heteroskedasticity (Greene, 2003); (iii) the Wooldridge test for serial correlation (Drukker, 2003); (iv) the test of cross sectional dependence of Pesaran (2004) , Frees (1995) , and Friedman (1937); (v) the Hausman test, Fixed Effects (FE) vs. Random Effects (RE), that tests for the presence of individual effects against random effects; and (vi) the tests to assess the panels for heterogeneity of countries, the Hausman tests by comparing the PMG vs. the MG estimators, and the MG vs. the Dynamic Fixed Effects (DFE) estimators.\nTable 4.

Accordingly, the prevalence of a homogeneous panel indicates that the countries share common coefficients and are suitable for treatment as a group. These results could be interpreted as evidence that globalization and international commitments, such as the Kyoto Protocol and EU Directives, have shaped identical measures for the countries. As noted by specification tests, the Driscoll\nand Kraay (1998) estimator with fixed effects proved to be appropriate for handling these data features. Additionally, as a benchmark, the results of FE estimator with conventional standard errors, robust standard errors, autocorrelation and with dynamic fixed effects was compared with the results of Driscoll and Kraay estimator to control the presence of heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation, and cross-sections dependence (see Tables A.5, A.6, A.7, A.8, A.9 and A.10 in appendix).\n4.Results and discussion\nTable 5 discloses the semi-elasticities (short-run) and the elasticities (long-run) for each model. These elasticities are computed from the estimated models, which are displayed in Table A.2, by dividing the coefficient of the variables by the coefficient of ECM both lagged once, and then multiplying by -1. On the whole, all models support co-integration / long memory, given that the ECM is negative and highly statistically significant. In fact, this emphasizes the relevance of using the ARDL approach. It is worthwhile to note that the high elasticities observed are compatible with the take-off phase that renewables\u2019 technology experienced, precisely during the time span under analysis. This evidence is an additional proof of robustness of the results. As further evidence of results robustness, the results of Driscoll and Kraay estimator are compared with the results of the FE estimator with conventional and robust standard errors, and with autocorrelation and dynamic fixed effect. In general, the models keep the robustness among the estimators for all coefficients (see Tables A.5 to A.10 in appendix).\nThe results show that direct investments, regulatory instruments and voluntary approaches are ineffective for promoting both electricity generation and installed capacity of RES (models RES_EG and RES_IC). In contrast, fiscal/financial incentives, market-based instruments, information and education, are effective for RES deployment. However, it is worth noting and comparing the results of the policies and the drivers on promoting the deployment of wind power and solar PV. The effects of PPSR and the other drivers on wind power and solar PV deployment can be observed in a summary form in Fig. 4 and 5 respectively. These results are compared with literature in order to provide specific indications and implications to assist policymakers in designing and fine-tuning their policies.\nWind power plant projects are large in scale, and funding arranged at regional, local or municipal levels have not produced the desired effect in implementing wind power. In contrast, \u201cinfrastructure investments\u201d are an effective policy instrument for promoting electricity generation using wind power. Indeed, wind power plants are located in isolated areas and require road access and connection to the grid, which implies large investments by governments. The purchase of renewable energy and services by public entities has proven effective in promoting installed capacity of both wind power and solar PV. In fact, this policy instrument has always fostered competition to encourage low-cost installations of RES.\nTable 5.

Of note in this category are the effects of FIT/premiums and tax relief to promote solar PV and wind power respectively. Indeed, FITs are in line with investors\u2019 preferences, guaranteeing a price for the electricity generated and dispatch priority order. Furthermore, this policy instrument has also stimulated consumers to be producers, through the installation of solar PV panels in their homes (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2012). They produce and consume their own electricity or sell it to the grid with the benefit of a guaranteed price. In\nfact, this influence is shown by the positive effect of loans. Although this policy instrument is statistically significant at only 10%, it is designed to help consumers to invest and implement solar PV panels in their homes. Even though wind power projects imply a large initial investment, tax exemptions and reductions encourage large investments in wind power plants. These policy instruments have been drivers for the deployment of renewables, besides being more effective for this specific technology, but they are directly dependant on public budgets and this dependence can lead to an excessive burden on economies (Bird et al., 2005; Carley, 2009; Marques and Fuinhas, 2012; Menz and Vachon, 2006).\nIn contrast with these types of approach, the market-driven approach, using measures such as codes and standards, are the subcategory of regulatory instruments that incorporate Renewables\u2019 Standard Portfolio policies. Actually, this approach does not guarantee a fixed price but imposes a minimum limit on electricity generation through RES. Furthermore, the policy instruments that incorporate green and white certificates are intended to make the electricity market more competitive, as the price of RES generation depends on the demand and supply of greenhouse gas licences, and imposes quota obligations for RES production (Menanteau et al., 2003; Ringel, 2006).\nFunds to Sub-national Governments\nPolicy Support\nOther Mandatory Requirements\nLoans\nOil, Coal and Gas Intensity (short-run)\nGross Domestic Product\nWind\nInfrastructure Investments\nCarbon Dioxide Emissions\n+ J Procurement Rules\n+ ) Grants and Subsidies\n+ ) Tax Relief\n+ ) Oil Intensity (long-run)\nFigure 4 Summary of the estimated effects on wind power of the PPSR and the other drivers.\nThe policy-based measures that are independent from the electricity market, such as FIT and tax exemptions, can influence the market prices in ways that are different from market-based instruments such as RPS and green and white certificates. The producers that benefit from direct or indirect investment by governments are usually separate from price fluctuations in markets. Indeed, they have no incentive to bid in the market because they will receive a fixed price or a tax reduction and they have a dispatch priority order, which can influence the market prices. Despite this, market-driven instruments are exposed to market prices. Producers bid in electricity market and receive the market price of the electricity generated in addition to the\nvalue of green and white certificates or quota obligations. However, these policies increase the risk for investors due to the price volatility of both electricity and market instruments, and thus may have an impact on the deployment of RES. Indeed, this market-driver can be seen as a booster of RES implementation. Indeed, its positive effect is shown in both the short- and long-run on RES production and installed capacity of solar PV.\nLoans (short-run)\nObligation Schemes\nInfrastructure Investments\nProcurement Rules (short-run)\nOil and Coal Intensity\nGross Domestic Product\nPV\nSolar\n+ J FIT and Premiums\n+J Procurement Rules (long-run)\n+ ) Loans (long-run)\n+) Green and White Certificates\n+ J Policy Support\n+ J Codes and Standards (RPS)\n+J Research and Development\nFigure 5 Summary of the estimated effects on solar PV of the PPSR and the other drivers.\nFocusing, once again on solar PV results, the positive effect of research, development and deployment can be seen in both the short- and long-run. In fact, solar PV technologies have undergone great technological development, mainly since 2004 when they increased their efficiency by 16% (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2012).\nPolicies to promote public and stakeholder knowledge and awareness are effective in encouraging RES deployment. While, the creation of specific bodies and guidance in policy development are effective for promoting solar PV generation they are ineffective in promoting wind power. In contrast, carbon dioxide emissions constitute a strong incentive to invest in wind power. Indeed, the results demonstrate that carbon dioxide emissions and the intensity of natural gas in an economy are the only drivers that have a positive effect in both the short-and long-run on the deployment of wind power and solar PV, respectively. However, the majority of results show that fossil fuel intensity in economies is ineffective for promoting RES. This effect is quoted by some authors (Aguirre and Ibikunle, 2014; Marques et al., 2010). The proportion of electricity generated from fossil fuel sources delays the commitment to RES in the short-run, but in the long-run oil intensity in an economy has a positive effect on wind power deployment. This effect was due to high oil prices, which consequently, encouraged the shift from oil towards RES. It is worth stressing that natural gas is not a heavy polluter and remains as a back-up to RES, mainly solar PV. However, gross domestic product has been ineffective in encouraging the deployment of RES. This unexpected effect could be explained\nby the financial crisis and the oil price boom, as mentioned by some authors (Al-mulali et al., 2014; Cowan et al., 2014; Lin and Moubarak, 2014; Marques and Fuinhas, 2015).\nIn summary, the results indicate that policies implemented for a specific technology are effective for RES deployment. However, policymakers have continued to implement market-driven policies to foster competition and encourage lower-costs installations of RES.\nIndeed, market-driven policies are shown to boost implementation of solar PV but not wind power, because this technology is mostly implemented through direct investments and financial support. However, policy-driven approach has a positive effect on RES implementation, mainly wind power. These policies could increase the burden on economies and negatively influence the electricity market, given that wind power generation is independent of the electricity market price. In contrast, the mix of market-driven and policy-driven approaches has a positive effect on solar PV, and encourages consumers to become producers, interacting directly with the electricity market and making the economies more dynamic. In short, a mix of market-driven and policy-driven approaches requires fewer resources from the whole economy, and can make RES and the electricity market more competitive. Indeed, the results of solar PV have demonstrated that a mix of policy and market driven approaches is favourable for increasing the deployment of RES.\n5.Conclusions\nThis research is focused on the 20 countries with the highest electricity production using RES, for the time span from 1990 until 2014. It adds a new empirical evaluation considering both short- and long-run components to assess the effectiveness of PPSR on RES deployment. The ARDL models are often applied disregarding the possibility of heterogeneity of crosses. However, the results showed that policies towards renewables are similar among the countries, given their obligations to meet international commitments. A battery of model specification tests were made and the Driscoll and Kraay estimator with fixed effects was selected as the most suitable estimator to handle panel data features. It is worth highlighting that the additional robustness of the models can be assessed by the high elasticities observed, because they are compatible with the take-off phase experienced by renewable technologies.\nThe comparative analysis of PPSR effects on RES deployment were made in two ways: (i) comparing the effectiveness of PPSR on RES installed capacity and electricity generation under RES; and (ii) comparing the effectiveness of PPSR on the RES aggregately, and individually on the new renewable sources, such as wind power and solar PV. Technologically specific policies have been more effective and, generally, so have policies that affect the installed capacity. Consequently, they have had the same effect on electricity generation. Overall, the results seem robust and suggest that the framework and implementation of policies can be changed so that economic growth is not compromised and RES can become competitive through their inherent strengths without relying on any externalities.\nThe dynamic analysis proves that some PPSR have not been drivers for the deployment of RES. Measures such as funds to sub-national governments, obligation schemes, and other mandatory requirements and loans have not yet produced the desired effects on RES deployment in the short-run. In contrast, the results reveal that procurement rules, infrastructure investments, grants and subsidies, tax relief, FIT and premiums, green and white certificates, codes and standards (RPS) and research and development policies have been effective in RES deployment. In addition, PPSR are not equally effective for wind and solar PV. The deployment of wind power sources has been established essentially based on policy-driven approaches rather than on market-driven instruments. In contrast, solar PV deployment has been achieved by a mix of policy and market driven instruments. Research and development policies have been important to solar PV deployment, as well as FIT, premiums and loans. Indeed, this policy not only supports the investments of big players, but encourages consumers to become producers and consequently interact directly in the energy markets. Moreover, market-based instruments, such as green and white certificates and codes and standards, have boosted electricity generation from solar PV sources and consequently increased their installed capacity. Despite this, the results showed that this type of policy is ineffective for implementing wind power. Indeed, this lack of effectiveness requires the attention of policymakers to design and fine\ntune market-driven instruments to integrate wind power more fully into the market and reduce the burden on economies caused by supporting wind power through policy-based instruments. Carbon dioxide emissions have been a driver for the deployment of wind power, but the intensity of fossil fuels have not. Indeed, the deployment of wind power has been established mainly by reducing the risk of investment, which may have reduced the competitiveness of this technology.\nThe intensity of fossil fuels in economies and carbon dioxide emissions are in line with the literature, namely validating the existence of lobbying in delaying the deployment of RES and confirming that natural gas, being a less-polluting energy source, can lead to the intermittency of RES and thus hamper RES deployment. It was also found that either gross domestic product did not play an important role in encouraging RES deployment, or that this effect was due to the period in analysis including the effects of the oil price boom and the financial crisis.\nOverall, the results seem robust and suggest that the deployment of solar PV has been established through a mix of policy- and market-driven approaches and that wind power was established essentially through direct subsidies and public intervention. It is essential to adjust market-based policies to produce desirable effects on wind power deployment, and decrease the burden on the cost of energy for economies. At the same time, this will make wind power more competitive in the market and, consequently, decrease the costs of implementation.\nFurther research is needed to help design and fine-tune the policy-based approach, in order to produce the desired effects in the shortest time and at the lowest cost for society. Furthermore, it is necessary to help fine-tune market-based instruments, without causing market failures, to foster competition and encourage a less-costly installation of RES.\nAbdmouleh, Z., Alammari, R. a.
