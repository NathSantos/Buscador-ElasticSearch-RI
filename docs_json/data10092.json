No que diz respeito aos antibi\u00f3ticos, usados no tratamento e \npreven\u00e7\u00e3o de infe\u00e7\u00f5es, estes representam um problema para o meio ambiente \ne para os seres vivos em geral, devido ao desenvolvimento da resist\u00eancia \nbacteriana. O antibi\u00f3tico sulfametoxazol (SMX) pertence ao grupo das \nsulfonamidas, um dos grupos de antibi\u00f3ticos mais utilizados, sendo encontrado \ncom regularidade n\u00e3o s\u00f3 em efluentes provenientes de esta\u00e7\u00f5es de tratamento \nde \u00e1gua residuais, como no ambiente aqu\u00e1tico. Assim, a fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o surge \ncomo um processo alternativo para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o deste tipo de contaminantes do \nmeio aqu\u00e1tico. O recurso a fotossensibilizadores, naturais ou sint\u00e9ticos, poder\u00e1 \nser uma forma de aumentar a efici\u00eancia da fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o e, \nconsequentemente, a taxa de fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, neste trabalho, as \nsubst\u00e2ncias h\u00famicas, consideradas fotossensibilizadores naturais, n\u00e3o se \nmostraram eficientes no aumento da taxa de fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o do SMX. O \ncomposto em estudo foi fotodegradado em \u00e1gua ultrapura, sob radia\u00e7\u00e3o solar \nsimulada, muito rapidamente, tendo-se obtido um tempo de meia vida de 0,86 \nhoras. Contudo, em amostras ambientais de diferentes origens, a taxa de \nfotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o do SMX mostrou ser muito mais lenta quando comparada com \na observada em \u00e1gua ultrapura e na presen\u00e7a das subst\u00e2ncias h\u00famicas, com \ntempos de vida a variar entre as 5,30 e as 7,54 horas. Tendo em conta a \nconvers\u00e3o destes tempos de meia vida para tempos de meia vida em \ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais, obtiveram-se valores que variaram entre 1.4 e 1.98 dias \nsoalheiros de ver\u00e3o. Desta forma, foi importante estudar a influ\u00eancia de \nalgumas das propriedades das matrizes aquosas para perceber quais os \nprincipais fatores respons\u00e1veis pela persist\u00eancia do SMX no ambiente \naqu\u00e1tico. Dessa forma, concluiu-se que o pH, a salinidade e o carbono \norg\u00e2nico dissolvido influenciam de forma acentuada a fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o do SMX. \nCom o objetivo de aplicar a fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s esta\u00e7\u00f5es de tratamento de \n\u00e1guas residuais, nomeadamente, como tratamento terci\u00e1rio, testou- se um \nm\u00e9todo de fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o em modo cont\u00ednuo em que os tempos de irradia\u00e7\u00e3o \ndiminu\u00edram acentuadamente relativamente ao m\u00e9todo em descont\u00ednuo.  Por \nfim, foi avaliada a atividade antibacteriana do SMX em \u00e1gua ultrapura e em \ntr\u00eas amostras ambientais, antes e durante a fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o, tendo-se \nconclu\u00eddo que a fotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 eficiente para combater a problem\u00e1tica da \nresistencia bacteriana, uma vez que a atividade bacteriana aumentou com a \nfotodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o total do SMX. A \u00fanica exce\u00e7\u00e3o foi a amostra da esta\u00e7\u00e3 de \ntratamento de \u00e1guas residuais para a qual n\u00e3o foi possivel retirar conclus\u00f5es, \numa vez que esta, s\u00f3 por si, inibe muito o crescimento das bacterias Vibrio \nfischeri. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nkeywords \n\n \n\nSulfamethoxazole, photodegradation, antibacterial activity, quantum yield.  \n\n \n\n \n\nabstract \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of pharmaceuticals, namely antibiotics, in the environment is a \nsubject of high concern due to their environmental impact, since the sewage \ntreatment plants (STPs) are not completely efficient in their removal.  In relation \nto antibiotics, used in the treatment and prevention of infections, they represent \na problem for the environment and for living organisms in general, because of \nthe imminent development of bacterial resistance. The antibiotic \nsulfamethoxazole (SMX) belongs to the group of sulfonamides, one of the most \ncommonly used antibiotics, and is regularly found, not only in effluents from \nSTPs, but also in the aquatic environment. Thus, photodegradation appears as \nan alternative process for the removal of this type of contaminants from the \naquatic environment. The use of natural and synthetic photosensitizers may be \na way of increasing the efficiency of photodegradation and, consequently, the \nrate of photodegradation. However, in this work, the humic substances (HS), \nconsidered natural photosensitizers, were not efficient in increasing the SMX \nphotodegradation rate. The compound under study was photodegraded very \nfast in ultrapure water under simulated solar radiation, presenting a half-life \ntime of 0.86 hours. However, in environmental water samples from different \norigins, the SMX photodegradation rate was shown to be much slower than that \nobserved in ultrapure water or under the presence of HS, with half-life times \n\nthat varied between 5.30 and 7.54 hours. With the conversion of these half-life \ntimes to half-life times under environmental conditions, values ranging from 1.4 \nto 1.98 sunny summer days were obtained. Thus, it was important to study the \ninfluence of some of the properties of the water matrices on the SMX \nphotodegradation to understand the main factors responsible for the \npersistence of SMX in the aquatic environment. It was concluded that pH, \nsalinity and dissolved organic carbon strongly influence the photodegradation \nof SMX. In order to apply the photodegradation in STPs, namely as a tertiary \ntreatment, a method of photodegradation was tested in a continuous flow mode \nin which the irradiation times decreased sharply in relation to the batch method. \nFinally, the antibacterial activity of SMX in ultrapure water and in three \nenvironmental water samples was evaluated before and during \nphotodegradation. It was concluded that the photodegradation is an efficient \nmethod to combat the problem of bacterial resistance, since the bacterial \nactivity increased with the total photodegradation of the SMX. The exception \nwas the STP sample, in which it was not possible to obtain conclusions, \nbecause the sample itself inhibited the growth of the Vibrio fischeri bacteria. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nAbbreviations \n\n \n\nAOPs \u2013 Advanced Oxidation Processes \n\nCAM \u2013 Clarithromycin \n\nDNA \u2013 DesoxyriboNucleic Acid \n\nDOC \u2013 Dissolved Organic Carbon \n\nDOM \u2013 Dissolved Organic Matter \n\nE1 \u2013 Estrone \n\nE2 \u2013 17?-Estradiol \n\nEE2 \u2013 17?-ethinylestradiol \n\nE3 \u2013 Estriol  \n\nERY \u2013 Erythromycin \n\nEU \u2013 European Union  \n\nFA \u2013 Fulvic Acid \n\nFAO \u2013 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n\nHA \u2013 Humic Acid \n\nHPLC-FLD \u2013 High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection \n\nHS \u2013 Humic Substances \n\nIUPAC \u2013 International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry \n\nLCM \u2013 Lincomycin \n\nLin ?

Introduction \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.1. Pharmaceuticals in the environment \n\n \n\nDemographic growth and industrial expansion brought, as a consequence, air, soil \n\nand water resources pollution worldwide. This situation is worrying, being necessary to \n\nreverse or leastways minimize this process (Melo et al., 2009). \n\n The question related with water quality has been widely discussed, because this is a \n\nnatural resource essential to many human activities, for example, public and industrial \n\nsupply, agricultural irrigation, electric power production, leisure and recreation activities, as \n\nwell as to the preservation of aquatic life. Given this context, treatment of waste water has \n\nbeen gaining more and more importance (Melo et al., 2009). \n\n The presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments was verified for the first \n\ntime in the 70\u2019s. Since that, many studies have been performed and residual \n\npharmaceuticals have been detected in different parts of the world (Bastos, 2012), \n\n(Katsumata et al., 2014), (Melo et al., 2009). These compounds and their metabolites have \n\nbeen found in municipal sewage, because the conventional STPs do not have adequate \n\nprocesses for their removal from the aqueous matrix and also because they are used in \n\nhigh amounts worldwide (Bastos, 2012), (Katsumata et al., 2014). Therefore, it is important \n\nand imperative for the scientific community to conduct investigations to solve this problem.  \n\n More recently, investigation on pharmaceuticals monitoring in the aquatic \n\nenvironment has been performed in different countries such as Germany, Brazil, Canada, \n\nUnited States of America (USA), Netherlands (NED), England, Sweden and Italy. These \n\ncompounds were found in STPs, surface water, ground water and potable water in \n\nconcentrations ranging from \u00b5g/L to ng/L (table 1) (Bila and Dezotti, 2003), (K\u00fcmmerer, \n\n2001). So, the development of sufficiently sensitive analytical methods for the determination \n\n(identification and quantification) of these compounds in aquatic environments is important \n\n(Bastos, 2012), (Bila and Dezotti, 2003), (Melo et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nTable 1- Concentrations of pharmaceuticals detected in the aquatic environment (adapted from Bila et al. \n\n(2003)).

Also, other \n\nfactors play a role on the concentrations found: studies show that the typical concentration \n\nvalues of the pharmaceuticals found in aquatic environments are related to their \n\nconsumption pattern by the population, the rate of removal in the STP, the type of effluent \n\nthat arrives to the STP and by seasonality (Bastos, 2012), (Melo et al., 2009). \n\n  \n\n17?-Estradiol Hormone 21 Domestic sewage in Brazil \n\n<0.5-17 Domestic sewage in Italy and \n\nNED \n\n2.7-48 Effluent of STP in England \n\n9-160 Surface Water in USA \n\nEstrone Hormone 20-50 Surface Water in Brazil \n\n27 Surface Water in USA \n\n40 Domestic Sewage in Brazil \n\n<0.5-38 Domestic sewage in Italy and \n\nNED \n\n9 Effluent of STP in Germany \n\n<0.5-54 Effluent of STP in Italy and \n\nNED \n\nEstriol Hormone 19 Surface Water in USA \n\n2-4 Effluent of STP in England \n\n0.43-18 Effluent of STP in Italy \n\n1.2-3.1 Surface Water in England \n\n24-188 Domestic sewage in Italy \n\nProgesterone Hormone 110 Surface Water in USA \n\nTestosterone Hormone 116 Surface Water in USA \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nIn some locations in the world, the raw sewage is released directly into surface water, \n\nbecause they have a deficit in sanitation infrastructures (Melo et al., 2009). When there are \n\nsanitation infrastructures, these compounds pass through a STP, where they are subjected \n\nto conventional treatment processes, but are not totally eliminated, being found in significant \n\namounts in STP effluents and surface water. \n\nConventional processes are based on adsorption to solid component of sludge and \n\non biological degradation of the contaminants which are not efficient in completely remove \n\nthis type of compounds, since they can have biocide action or complex chemical structures \n\nnot amenable to biodegradation (Castiglioni et al., 2006), (K\u00fcmmerer, 2001), (Melo et al., \n\n2009). Consequently, many pharmaceuticals enter the aquatic environment (persisting in \n\nthe environment) and eventually reach drinking water (Bila and Dezotti, 2003), (Melo et al., \n\n2009). \n\n The veterinary use, including in aquaculture, as growth promoters and in the \n\nprevention and treatment of diseases, also counts for the discharge of pharmaceuticals and \n\ntheir metabolites into the environment through (waste) water or by water run-off from fields \n\nafter application of manure. Pharmaceuticals can therefore enter the ground water system \n\nthrough the soil after the application of liquid manure or sewage sludge as fertilizers (Bila \n\nand Dezotti, 2003), (K\u00fcmmerer, 2001), (Melo et al., 2009). However, the waste water from \n\npharmaceuticals\u2019 companies and hospitals and the improper disposal of pharmaceuticals \n\nshould also be considered as significant contributors to the presence of these compounds \n\nin the environment (Bila and Dezotti, 2003), (Melo et al., 2009). In figure 1, possible routes \n\nfor the introduction of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment are schematized (Bastos, \n\n2012), (Bila and Dezotti, 2003).  \n\nFrom all the stated above, it is clear that the water contamination by pharmaceuticals \n\ndeserve special attention, since the real risks to human health and to the aquatic \n\nenvironment are not yet fully known and because there is no established legal limits for \n\nenvironmental concentrations (Bastos, 2012), (Melo et al., 2009). Antibiotics, hormones, \n\nanalgesics, anti-inflammatories are examples of different pharmaceuticals detected in \n\nwaste water. However, some groups need special attention, mainly antibiotics, because of \n\ntheir pronounced toxicity and their potential of fostering bacterial resistance (Bila and \n\nDezotti, 2003), (K\u00fcmmerer, 2001).   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1- Routes of pharmaceuticals introduction into the environment (adapted from Silva (2014)).  \n\n \n\n1.1.1. Occurrence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment \n\nOriginally, the word antibiotic referred to any agent with biological activity against \n\nliving organisms. Now, antibiotic refers to substances with antibacterial, anti-fungal or anti-\n\nparasitical activity (K\u00fcmmerer, 2009). In table 2, an overview of the most important classes \n\nof antibiotics is given. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nTable 2- Important classes of antibiotic compounds (adapted from K\u00fcmmerer et al. (2009)).  \n\nClass Example Chemical structure \n\n\u00df-lactams Amoxicillin  \n\nTetracyclines Doxycycline \n \n\nMacrolides Erythromycin A \n \n\nGlycopeptides Vancomycin \n \n\nSulfonamides Sulfamethoxazole \n \n\nQinolones Ciprofloxacin \n \n\n  \n\nIn the 20th century, the discovery of antibiotics and their use in anti-infectious therapy \n\nconstituted an unquestionable progress in medicine (Instituto Nacional de Sa\u00fade Doutor \n\nRicardo Jorge, 2010). The antibiotics are the mostly used pharmaceuticals in human and \n\nveterinary medicine (G\u00f6bel et al., 2005), (Hirsch et al., 1999).  \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nThe most important classes of antibiotics for human medicine are ?-lactams, \n\nsulfonamides (with or without trimethoprim (TMP)), macrolides and fluoroquinolones (table \n\n3) (G\u00f6bel et al., 2004),(Hirsch et al., 1999). As already mentioned, antibiotics are \n\nextensively used in animal medicine and the main groups of pharmaceuticals used are \n\ntetracyclines, sulfonamides and fenicoles (table 3). According Food and Agriculture \n\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), antibiotics authorized for use in aquaculture are \n\ntetracycline, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and sulfonamides potentiated with TMP or \n\normethoprim. In Norwegian aquaculture, from 2002 to 2005, an increase in the use of \n\nantibiotics in aquaculture was observed, which was accounted by newly-farmed fish \n\nspecies, especially Atlantic cod. However, for most countries specific data are missing \n\n(K\u00fcmmerer, 2009).   \n\nThe bacteriostatic sulfonamide pharmaceuticals, which includes the SMX, are \n\nantibiotics extensively used and the wide use in factory farming without proper withdrawal \n\nperiods has led to their accumulation in meat, eggs and milk as well as in fish (Hartig et al., \n\n1999).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nTable 3- Important antibiotics in human and animal medicine (adapted from Kemper et al. (2008)). \n\n \n\nThe antibiotics are polar, non-volatile and defined as naturally, semi-synthetic and \n\nsynthetic compounds with antimicrobial activity that can be applied parentally, orally or \n\ntopically (Kemper, 2008), (Sajjad, 2014). The first antibiotics were of natural origin, but \n\ncurrently, antibiotics are obtained by chemical synthesis, such as the sulfonamides (e.g. \n\nSMX) or by chemical modification of compounds of natural origin, such as paclitaxel used \n\nin chemotherapy medication (K\u00fcmmerer, 2009), (De Souza, 2004).    \n\n Antibiotics are complex molecules that can be present in the environment in the \n\nneutral, cationic, anionic or zwitterion forms. Thus, the physicochemical and biological \n\nproperties of these compounds vary with pH, in other words, properties such as solubility, \n\nClass Compounds Primary usage \n\n?-Lactams \n\n \n\nFlucloxacillin \n\nMethicillin \n\nPhenoxymethylcillin \n\nPenicillin G \n\nHumans \n\nHumans \n\nHumans \n\nHumans \n\nFenicoles Chloramphenicol Cats, dogs \n\nFluoroquinolones Ciprofloxacin \n\nFlumequin \n\nOfloxacin \n\nHumans \n\nHumans \n\nHumans \n\nMacrolides Erythromycin \n\nRoxithromycin \n\nVancomvcin \n\nHumans, cattle, chicken \n\nHumans \n\nHumans \n\nSulfonamides  Sulfanilamide \n\nSulfadimethoxine \n\nSulfadinidine \n\nSulfamethoxazole \n\nSulfapyridine \n\nSulfathiazole \n\nHumans \n\nCattle, pigs, chicken \n\nCattle, sheep, chicken \n\nHumans and animals \n\nPigs \n\nHumans \n\nTrimethoprim  In combination with sulfonamides \n\nTetracyclines Chlortetracycline \n\nDoxycycline \n\nOxytetracycline \n\nTetracycline \n\nCattle, pigs \n\nHumans, cats, dogs \n\nHuman, cattle, sheep, pigs \n\nHumans, horse, sheep, pigs \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nhydrophobic and hydrophilic character and partition coefficient, kow, of antibiotics depend \n\nessentially on pH (Sajjad, 2014). \n\nIt is documented in some studies that antibiotics are not completely metabolized in \n\nthe body and thus are excreted into the environment unchanged or in the form of their \n\nmetabolites via urine and feces (Carballa et al., 2004), (Gao et al., 2012), (Kemper, 2008). \n\nThe rates of excretion are dependent on the substance, the dose ingested, the mode of \n\napplication, the excreting species and time after administration (Bastos, 2012), (Bila and \n\nDezotti, 2003), (Castiglioni et al., 2006), (Melo et al., 2009). For tetracyclines and \n\nsulfonamides it has been shown that rates of excretion vary in the range (40-90) % (Kemper, \n\n2008). The disposal of expired or unused antibiotics is also a considerable source of these \n\ncompounds in the environment (Gao et al., 2012). It is important to note that concentration \n\nlimits of antibiotics in the environment are not regulated (Bengtsson-Palme and Larsson, \n\n2016), (Kemper, 2008), (Mili? et al., 2013).  \n\nBesides their use to prevent or treat diseases in humans, animals and plants, \n\nantibiotics are also used to promote the growth of animals in livestock and aquaculture \n\noperations (Gao et al., 2012), (Kemper, 2008), (K\u00fcmmerer, 2001). In 2001, it was reported \n\nthat more than 70 % of veterinary antibiotics consumption in the USA was as growth \n\npromoters (K\u00fcmmerer, 2001). However, in 2006, growth promoters were banned in Europe \n\nand thus there was an actual decline in antibiotics used in veterinary medicine (Kemper, \n\n2008). Aquacultures are an important source of antibiotics to the environment: (70-80) % of \n\nthe antibiotics administered as pelleted feed medication are released into the aquatic \n\nenvironment via urinary and fecal excretion and in unused medicated food (Christensen et \n\nal., 2006). \n\n Antibiotics have been detected in municipal sewage, hospital waste water, surface \n\nwater, ground water and in soil, sediment and sludge samples (Gao et al., 2012) and the \n\nresidual concentration of these compounds in the treated effluents depend on their removal \n\nduring STP treatment (G\u00f6bel et al., 2004). So, several studies have been conducted to \n\ninvestigate the occurrence of antibiotics in STPs and surface waters, especially, since these \n\ncompounds may promote bacterial resistance (Bastos, 2012). \n\nIsidori et al. (2005) determined six antibiotics: erythromycin (ERY), oxytetracycline \n\n(OTC), SMX, ofloxacin (OFL), lincomycin (LCM) and clarithromycin (CAM) belonging to \n\ndifferent classes of antibiotics in surface water samples from Germany and Italy. ERY was \n\nfound in concentrations of 0.02 and 0.016 \u00b5g/L in Germany and Italy, respectively. The \n\nconcentrations achieved for OTC were 0.05 \u00b5g/L (Germany) and 0.019 \u00b5g/L (Italy). The \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\ncompounds OFL and SMX were found only in Germany with concentrations of \n\n0.05 and 0.02 \u00b5g/L, respectively. CAM was detected in Germany and Italy with \n\nconcentrations of 0.02 \u00b5g/L (Isidori et al., 2005).  \n\n In the study developed by Tamtam et al. (2008) the occurrence of seventeen \n\nantibiotics in the Seine River inner estuary was investigated. Quinolones, sulfonamides, \n\nnitroimidazoles and diaminopyrimidines were the four classes of antibiotics analyzed (from \n\nJanuary to June 2006). All the seventeen compounds were detected at least once. In the \n\nspecific case of SMX, it was observed that it was detected in every sample and showed the \n\nhighest concentrations reaching 544 ng/L (Tamtam et al., 2008). \n\nThe presence of eleven antibiotics belonging to three classes was investigated in the \n\nBeibu Gulf, China (Zheng et al., 2012). ERY-H2O, SMX and TMP were the most frequently \n\ndetected, with mean concentrations in the range (0.51-6.30) ng/L. The concentrations of \n\nERY-H2O, SMX and sulfadimidine in the vicinity of aquaculture activities were larger, \n\nsuggesting that a higher intensity of aquaculture activities could contribute to increasing the \n\nlevels of antibiotics in the environment (Zheng et al., 2012).  \n\nIn the research developed by Hirsch et al. (1999), eighteen antibiotics from the \n\nclasses of macrolides, sulfonamides, penicillins and tetracyclines were analyzed. The \n\ninvestigated STP effluents and surface water samples showed frequent appearance of \n\nroxithromycin (ROX) and SMX with concentrations up to 6 \u00b5g/L. Neither tetracyclines nor \n\npenicillins could be detected at concentration levels above 50 and 20 ng/L, respectively \n\n(Hirsch et al., 1999).  \n\nThe determination of thirteen sulfonamides was performed in primary and secondary \n\neffluents of STPs and in different surface waters (Hartig et al., 1999). In this study, the \n\ncompounds SMX and sulfadiazine (SD) were detected with concentrations in the ranges \n\n(30-2000) and (10-100) ng/L, respectively (Hartig et al., 1999). As in the previous article, \n\nSMX was also detected in waste water samples from two STPs in Switzerland. SMX was \n\ndetected in the primary effluent with a concentration ranging from (343-641) ng/L, in the \n\nsecondary effluent with a concentration between (343-352) ng/L and in the tertiary effluent \n\nwith a concentration of 352 ng/L (G\u00f6bel et al., 2004).  \n\nThe occurrence of twenty-two antibiotics was investigated in eight STPs in Beijing, \n\nChina (Gao et al., 2012). The antibiotics studied belonged to the fluoroquinolones, \n\nsulfonamides and macrolides classes and the most frequently detected antibiotics were \n\nOFL, norfloxacin (NOR), SD, SMX, ERY and ROX. The concentrations of fluoroquinolones \n\nOFL and NOR were in the range (0.15-1.2) and (0.0094-0.20) \u00b5g/L, respectively. For SD \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nand SMX, antibiotics belonging to the sulfonamides group, the concentration varied \n\nbetween (0.12-0.56) and (0.13-0.46) \u00b5g/L, respectively. The concentrations of ERY and \n\nROX detected in effluent samples were in the ranges (0.051-0.30) and (0.054-0.36) \u00b5g/L, \n\nrespectively.  \n\nThe presence of twenty-eight antibiotics was investigated in South\u2013East Queensland, \n\nAustralia (Watkinson et al., 2009). In hospital effluents, antibiotics were found in \n\nconcentrations in the range (0.01-14.5) ?g/L, dominated by ?-lactam, quinolone and \n\nsulfonamide groups. Antibiotics were also found in STPs influents, up to 64 ?g/L, and \n\neffluents in the low ng/L range up to a maximum of 3.4 ?g/L, with the macrolide, quinolone \n\nand sulfonamide antibiotics being the most prevalent. Similarly, antibiotics were detected in \n\nthe low ng/L range, up to 2 ?g/L in surface waters of six investigated rivers (Watkinson et \n\nal., 2009).  \n\nAmong the different existent sulfonamides, SMX is one of the compounds most \n\nfrequently detected in municipal sewage. However, concentrations of SMX in effluents from \n\nSTPs vary widely, as these depend on the use of the antibiotic and the type of treatment \n\nused in the STPs (Sajjad, 2014). In the next table (table 4), the different concentrations of \n\nSMX in different aquatic matrixes are presented.  \n\n \n\nTable 4- Concentration of SMX in aquatic environment. \n\nLocalization Concentration of SMX \n\n(ng/L) \n\nAquatic matrix References \n\nChina 545-791 Effluents Peng et al., 2006 \n\nGermany 30-85 Surface Water Bila and Dezotti, 2003 \n\nIsrael 90-150 Effluents Avisar et al., 2009 \n\nBrazil 0.78-106 Surface water Locatelli et al., 2011 \n\n  \n\nIn the body, SMX is metabolized and 50 % of the administered dose is excreted as \n\nthe inactive human metabolite N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole (N-Ac-SMX) and only 10 % as \n\nthe unchanged compound. There are few studies concerning the SMX metabolites: SMX \n\nand its metabolite N-Ac-SMX were detected in two urban STPs from Switzerland (G\u00f6bel et \n\nal., 2004). The maximum concentration determined for the metabolite was (943 \u00b1 2.9) ng/L \n\nwhile for SMX the higher concentration was (641 \u00b1 4.0) ng/L (G\u00f6bel et al., 2004). Although \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nthe concentration was higher for SMX metabolite, it lacked relevant antibacterial activity \n\n(Brown, 2014). Also, Senta et al., (2013) detected the presence of SMX (323 \u00b1 135) ng/L \n\nand N-Ac-SMX (214 \u00b1 177) ng/L in a STP of Zagreb (Senta et al., 2013).  \n\n \n\n1.1.1.1. Bacterial resistance  \n\nThe excessive and uncontrolled use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine \n\ncauses two environmental problems: one is the contamination of water resources and the \n\nother is that some microorganisms can develop resistance to these pharmaceuticals \n\n(Heinemann et al., 2000), (Kemper, 2008). Bacteria previously susceptible to an \n\nantimicrobial compound can undergo changes in their genetic material, through mutation or \n\nthrough genetic transfer processes (such as transformation, transduction and conjugation), \n\ngaining pharmaceutical resistance. The evolution of antibacterial resistance in human and \n\nin animals is the result of the interaction between antibiotic exposure and the transmission \n\nof resistance within and between individuals (Heinemann et al., 2000). The resistance of \n\nbacteria is not developed only by direct therapeutic use of antibiotics, but also by indirect \n\ncontact with them (Kemper, 2008).  \n\nThe misuse of antibiotics by both practitioners and patients and the poor quality of \n\npharmaceuticals marketed in developing countries and also, an increase of antimicrobials \n\ncomsumption in most developed countries, are factors related to bacterial resistance. For \n\nexemple, in children, it has been shown that at 200 days after birth more than 70 % of the \n\ninfants had used at least one antibiotic (Guillemot, 1999). So, it is important to do an optimal \n\nantibiotic use and limit the diffusion of existing antibacterial resistance in the population and \n\navoid the emergence of new strains of resistant bacteria (Fair and Tor, 2014) (Guillemot, \n\n1999), (Heinemann et al., 2000), (Penesyan et al., 2015), (Zhang et al., 2015).  \n\nCombating bacterial resistance involves shortening the time to investigate new \n\nantibiotics, which currently exceeds a decade, and quickly find new therapeutic alternatives, \n\nsince the antibiotics currently available are ineffective in combating the new strains of \n\nbacteria that arise all the days (ionline, 2015) or in another perspective to remove effectively \n\nthe antibiotics from the environment, avoiding the development of more bacterial resistance. \n\nHowever, it is equally or even more important to make people aware of the proper use of \n\nantibiotics.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n1.1.1.2. Sulfamethoxazole \n\n1.1.1.2.1. Structure and physico-chemical properties \n\n According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), SMX is \n\ndenominated 4-amino-N-(5-methyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide, so C10H11N3O3S \n\nis the molecular formula.  \n\n SMX is a representative antibacterial compound of the sulfonamide group and it is \n\nfrequently used in human medicine to treat bronchitis and urinary infections and also in \n\nveterinary medicine, for prevention and treatment of infections, as well as growth promoter \n\n(Abell\u00e1n et al., 2009). The bactericidal sulfonamide group is considered to be one of the \n\nfirst antimicrobial pharmaceuticals used and it was intensively manufactured since the 40s, \n\nrevolutionizing the use of antibiotics in medicine. Sulfonamides have a bacteriostatic effect, \n\ninhibiting desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. The combination of the common \n\nantibacterial pharmaceutical TMP, a folic acid analogue, with SMX, inhibits two steps in the \n\nenzymatic pathway for folic acid synthesis, necessary for the synthesis of DNA and \n\nribonucleic acid (RNA) precursors in bacteria, therefore necessary for the survival of \n\nbacteria.  \n\n The chemical structure of SMX and the chemical structure of the general \n\nsulfonamides are represented in figure 2 (Bastos, 2012). Table 5 summarizes the \n\nphysicochemical properties of SMX. \n\n \n\nFigure 2- SMX chemical structure (a) and general chemical structure of sulfonamides (b).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nTable 5- Physicochemical properties of SMX (adapted from Boreen et al., (2004), Sulfamethoxazole-\n\nToxicology Data Network and Yalkowsky et al., (2010)).  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n If SMX is released onto soils, it is expected to have high mobility, since SMX have a \n\nlog Kow value lower than 10\n4, so it is a compound with low volatility and hydrophilic nature \n\n(Silva et al., 2012). The pKa1 and pKa2 of SMX indicate that this compound partially exists \n\nin the anionic form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb strongly to soils \n\ncontaining organic carbon and clay. If released into water, SMX is not expected to adsorb \n\nto suspended solids and sediment based. So, in general, sulfonamides are not quickly \n\nbiodegraded and can persist in soils. Bioconcentration is related to the ratio of the \n\nconcentration of a particular chemical in a living organism to the chemical\u2019s concentration \n\nin the surrounding water. An estimated bioconcentration factor of 3 suggests that the \n\npotential of SMX bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low (Sulfamethoxazole-\n\nToxicology Data Network). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Removal processes for pharmaceuticals in STPs  \n\n \n\nIn order to avoid the risks associated with the presence of pharmaceuticals in water, \n\nthey should be eliminated before final release into the environment. In general, they can be \n\neliminated by sorption (physical processes), biodegradation (biological processes) or \n\nphotolysis and photocatalysis (oxidation processes). \n\nMolecular weight (g/mol) 253.28 \n\nWater Solubility (mg/L at 37 \u00baC) 610 \n\nMelting Point (\u00baC) 167 \n\nVapor pressure (mm Hg at 25 \u00baC) 6.93x10-8 \n\nLog Kow 0.89 \n\nDissociation constants pka1=1.6 \npka2=5.7 \n\nBioconcentration Factor 3 \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nThe elimination of pharmaceuticals from waste water in STPs is dependent on the \n\npharmaceuticals structural characteristics and physico-chemical properties, such as \n\nphotosensitivity, biodegradability, lipophilicity and on the environmental conditions (Melo et \n\nal., 2009), (Radjenovic et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n1.2.1. Physical processes \n\nSorption elimination involves the uptake of pharmaceuticals from the aqueous phase \n\nonto a solid phase (sorbent) and this allows the effluents to be purified. However, \n\ncontaminants are not degraded or eliminated, only transferred to a new phase. \n\nNevertheless, this approach proved to be an effective and economic purification method to \n\nbe used as pre- or post-treatment process in STPs (Freire et al., 2000), (Jiuhui, 2008), (Melo \n\net al., 2009). In STPs operating with an activated sludge system, sorption is the dominant \n\nprocess in the removal of lipophilic compounds, such as estrogens (Melo et al., 2009).  \n\nAlso, adsorption of pharmaceuticals from STPs effluents, on activated carbons can \n\nbe an efficient strategy to them. The work developed by Calisto et al., (2015) describes the \n\nsingle adsorption of seven pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, oxazepam, SMX, piroxicam, \n\ncetirizine, venlafaxine and paroxetine) from water onto a commercially available activated \n\ncarbon and a non-activated carbon, produced by pyrolysis of primary paper mill sludge \n\n(Calisto et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n1.2.2. Biological processes  \n\nBiological processes are the most frequently used in the effluents treatment because \n\nthey allow the treatment of large volumes of effluents, high rates of organic matter removal, \n\nthe transformation of toxic organic compounds in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) or \n\nmethane (CH4) and costs are relatively low (Freire et al., 2000), (Melo et al., 2009). \n\nIn general, degradation of organic compounds depends on their bioavailability and \n\nalso on the ability of microbial organisms to transform and degrade them (Stumpe and \n\nMarschner, 2009). Biological processes may be aerobic or anaerobic. In aerobic processes, \n\nformation of CO2 and H2O happens, whereas in anaerobic we have the formation of CO2 \n\nand CH4 (Freire et al., 2000). However, some organic compounds are not degradable by \n\nthe microorganisms and therefore are resistant to biological treatment. (Freire et al., 2000). \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nThe enzymatic process, which belongs to biological processes, is a recent technology \n\nused in effluents biological treatment. Within this context, ligninolytic enzymes (lignin \n\nperoxidase and manganese peroxidase) have the capacity to degrade a large number of \n\ntoxic and persistent substances (Freire et al., 2000).  \n\n \n\n1.2.3. Oxidation processes  \n\n The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are attractive technologies that have been \n\nextensively studied due to their potential as an alternative or an addition to conventional \n\nprocesses for treating waste water, destructing a wide range of organic substances resistant \n\nto conventional methods (Augugliaro et al., 2006), (Freire et al., 2000), (Lester et al., 2010).  \n\nThe AOPs are defined as the chemical oxidation of target organic pollutants in water \n\nand these processes produce powerful transitory species, mainly hydroxyl radicals (?OH), \n\nby the combination of oxidants (such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), chlorine (Cl2), chlorine \n\ndioxide (ClO2), permanganate (MnO4\n-) with ultraviolet (UV) radiation or by the combination \n\nbetween UV radiation and catalysts (Augugliaro et al., 2006), (Freire et al., 2000), (Lester \n\net al., 2010), (Melo et al., 2009). AOPs have a high efficiency for organic matter oxidation, \n\nwhich can be converted to CO2, H2O and innocuous mineral salts (Augugliaro et al., 2006). \n\nHowever, in most cases, the use of this type of treatment promotes the formation of a wide \n\nvariety of by-products, which may be as toxic or even more toxic than the initial contaminant \n\n(Melo et al., 2009). UV radiation has been reported in the literature as being used in the \n\ndegradation of pharmaceuticals compounds, but it can also produce subproducts that can \n\nbe highly toxic and persistent in water (Bastos, 2012), so it is important to evaluate toxicity \n\nof subproducts formed. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is another effective method for the \n\nremoval of some pharmaceuticals from the aquatic environment based on the chemical \n\noxidation mediated by a semiconductor activated by UV radiation (Augugliaro et al., 2006). \n\nThis method involves the use of catalysts, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), ferric oxide \n\n(Fe2O3) and silicon (Si). In general, TiO2 is the photocatalyst mostly used due to its high \n\nstability over a wide pH range, water insolubility, photoactivity, low environmental impact, \n\nlow toxicity and cost, when compared to other available semiconductors (Augugliaro et al., \n\n2006), (Freire et al., 2000), (Melo et al., 2009). Although this method is efficient in the \n\nmineralization of several chemical species of environmental relevance, there are problems \n\nthat hinder large-scale treatment, such as the difficulty of radiation penetration in the \n\nreaction medium and the separation of the catalysts from the sample. The work of Hu et al. \n\n(2007) examines direct photolysis of SMX by UVA light (UVA: 324 ? ? ? 400 nm) and the \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\ndegradation of SMX in aqueous suspensions of nanophase TiO2 irradiated with visible light \n\n(? ? 400 nm) and with UVA light.  Experimental results demonstrated that no SMX \n\ndegradation was observed in TiO2 suspensions irradiated with visible light and direct \n\nphotolysis of SMX by UVA was slow (less than 10 % degradey in 60 minutes). In \n\ncomparison, 95 % SMX degradation was observed in UVA-irradiated TiO2 suspensions over \n\nthe same time. Rates of UVA\u2013TiO2 photocatalyzed SMX degradation were dependent on \n\ndifferent variables, including initial SMX concentration, catalyst phase identity and \n\nconcentration, electron acceptor identity and concentration, and the presence of non-target \n\nwater constituents. \n\nPhotodegradation using sunlight is an interesting method for removing \n\npharmaceuticals from the aquatic environments (Bastos, 2012), (Sajjad, 2014). In the \n\naquatic environment, photodegradation can occur via two processes: direct and indirect \n\nphotolysis, as can be seen in figure 3. These two processes are a primary pathway for \n\nabiotic transformation of the organic compounds in surface waters (Andreozzi et al., 2003). \n\nIn the direct photolysis, light is absorbed directly by the chemical itself, leading to bond \n\ncleavage (Chen et al., 2013), (Liu and Liu, 2004). The direct photolysis was shown to be \n\nefficient for the removal of contaminants only when the absorption spectrum of the pollutant \n\noverlaps the emission spectrum of the UV lamp and the quantum yield (?) of the \n\nphotochemical process is reasonably large (Andreozzi et al., 2003), (Lester et al., 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\nAndreozzi et al. (2003) evaluated the rate of degradation of six selected \n\npharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, clofibric acid, OFL, SMX and propranolol) \n\nDirect \n\nPhotolysis \n\nIndirect \n\nPhotolysis \n\nPhotosensitizers \n\n\u00b7OH      1O2      H2O2      3DOM \n\nPhotoproducts \n\n \n\nFigure 3- Direct and indirect photolysis occurring in the aquatic environment.   \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nsubmitting them to solar irradiation. Based on experimental results, the direct photolysis in \n\ndistilled water for SMX, diclofenac, OFL and propranolol undergo fast degradation with a \n\nhalf-life time (t1/2) of 2.4, 5.0, 10.6 and 16.8 days, respectively, whereas, under the same \n\nconditions,  carbamazepine and clofibric acid presented a t1/2, of around 100 days  \n\n(Andreozzi et al., 2003). So, for some compounds, the direct photolysis is not an efficient \n\nprocess for their removal in water.  \n\nIndirect photolysis consists of light absorption by photosensitizers, which generate \n\nstrong oxidant species, such as ?OH or singlet oxygen (1O2). The most important natural \n\nphotosensitizers are natural dissolved organic matter (DOM), nitrate and nitrite (Andreozzi \n\net al., 2003), (Freire et al., 2000), (Lam et al., 2003), (Lester et al., 2010), (Lin and Reinhard, \n\n2005), (Melo et al., 2009). For example, in the study above mentioned (Andreozzi et al., \n\n2003), the influence of nitrate ions present in aqueous solutions was also studied and the \n\nresults showed a reduction of t1/2, thus an increase in the degradation rate (Andreozzi et al., \n\n2003). DOM can act also as photosensitizer, however it has a dual role in photodegradation, \n\nacting not only as photosensitizer, but also as a filter of solar radiation. Total effect of the \n\nDOM presence depends on the balance between these opposite contributions, and for each \n\ntarget substance such effect may be different (Andreozzi et al., 2003), (Melo et al., 2009).  \n\n Some compounds may be photodegraded directly and indirectly in aqueous solution, \n\nas was proved in the case of estriol (E3) (Oliveira et al., 2016). Natural sunlight can degrade \n\nall estrogens in river water (Lin and Reinhard, 2005) and sea water (Zuo et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\n1.2.3.1. Photodegradation of SMX \n\n SMX is not completely degraded in conventional STPs, thus affecting aquatic and \n\nterrestrial organisms. However, only few studies have been conducted to evaluate the \n\neffectiveness of photodegradation on the removal of antibiotics, including SMX, from \n\ndrinking water and waste water effluents (Lester et al., 2010).  \n\nThe photochemical transformation of SMX using a solar simulator was investigated \n\nby Trov\u00f3 et al. (2009). Toxicity, persistence and route of degradation of SMX was evaluated \n\nin different water matrices: distilled water (pH = 4.8), distilled water + nitrate and sea water \n\n(pH = 8.1). In this study, differences in degradation rate in distilled water and sea water \n\nwere verified, being the photodegradation in sea water matrix slower. It was also verified \n\nthat indirect photolysis in the presence of nitrate in distilled water did not affect the SMX \n\ndegradation rate. For the solution of SMX prepared in distilled water (pH = 4.8), during the \n\nfirst 45 minutes of irradiation a decay of 40 % of the initial concentration of SMX was \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nobserved. The phototransformation rate slowed down markedly with time, probably because \n\nof the increase of pH from 4.8 to 6.4. Only after 30 hours of irradiation, 98 % of the initial \n\nconcentration of SMX was removed. In the experiments using sea water (pH = 8.1) \n\nsolutions, a slower kinetic was observed, where only a slight reduction in the SMX \n\nconcentration (14 %) occurred after 7 hours. This was considered to be due to the fact that \n\nSMX photolysis is strongly affected by pH. They made the identification of nine products of \n\nphotolysis in distilled water. In figure 4, the mechanism proposed by Trov\u00f3 et al. (2009) for \n\nthe degradation of SMX is represented. The cleavage of sulfonamide bond and \n\nrearrangement of the isoxazole ring represent the main pathways of degradation, which \n\ngenerate more abundant and persistent intermediates (C2, C3 and C8). On the aromatic \n\nrings C6, C9 and C1 hydroxylation reactions also occur. The addition of the hydroxyl radical \n\nto isoxazole ring formation occurs across C7, as well as with the C4, which is the only \n\nevidence of the opening of the isoxazole ring  (Trov\u00f3 et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\nIn the study developed by Bastos (2012), the direct photolysis of SMX in ultrapure \n\nwater with UV radiation was carried out considering the variation of the concentration (10-\n\n50 mg/L) and of the pH (5-9). In the first 30 minutes of photolysis, the removal rate of SMX \n\nin the acid medium was higher than that observed in neutral medium. After 60 minutes of \n\nirradiation, SMX had the removal % of 99 in all experiments (Bastos, 2012). \n\n \n\nFigure 4- Degradation path of SMX by direct photolysis in distilled water (from Trov\u00f3 et al. (2009)). \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n1.2.3.2. Importance of photosensitizers \n\n Photochemistry plays a crucial role in pharmaceuticals reduction in aquatic \n\nenvironments. Under solar irradiation, photochemical transformations involve direct and \n\nindirect reactions. As mentioned before, in indirect photodegradation the degradation of \n\ncompounds can be induced by the presence of natural photoreactive substances, such as \n\nHS. All these constituents may generate strong oxidants, undergo photoreactions, and \n\nfurther oxidize and degrade environmental pollutants in natural water (Chen et al., 2013), \n\n(al Housari et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n1.2.3.2.1. Humic substances \n\nHS are heterogeneous mixtures of polydispersed organic materials, which result from \n\nbiochemical and chemical reactions during the decay and transformation of plant and \n\nmicrobial remains, and therefore are formed in soils, sediments and natural waters. HS are \n\nmain components of the natural organic matter in terrestrial (soil organic matter) and aquatic \n\n(DOM) systems.  \n\nIn aqueous systems, like rivers, about 50 % of the dissolved organic materials are HS \n\nthat affect pH and alkalinity. In terrestrial and aquatic systems, HS affect the chemistry, \n\ncycling and bioavailability of chemical elements, as well as transport and degradation of \n\nxenobiotic and natural organic chemicals. These substances also affect biological activity \n\nin aquatic ecosystems (IHSS, 2007), (Stevenson, 1994).  \n\nHS have a high-molecular-weight, with aromatic cores, substituted with functional \n\ngroups and aliphatic cores (Aleksandrova et al., 2011). HS can be generally characterized \n\nas being rich in oxygen-containing functional groups, notably carboxylic group (COOH), but \n\nalso phenolic and/or enolic hydroxyl group (OH), alcoholic OH and carbonyl group (C=O) of \n\nquinones (Stevenson, 1994). They can operationally be divided into three main fractions: \n\nhumic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and humin: HA are insoluble under acid conditions, but \n\nsoluble at high pH values, FA are soluble in both alkali and acid conditions; humin is \n\ninsoluble in all pH values.  \n\nMost of the data on HA, FA and humin refer to average properties and structure of a \n\nlarge ensemble of components of diverse structure and molecular weight. The precise \n\nproperties and structure of a given HS sample depends on the water or soil source and the \n\nspecific conditions of extraction (IHSS, 2007), (Stevenson, 1994).  \n\nPhotolysis of HS, under solar radiation, can lead to the formation of various reactive \n\nspecies, such as 1O2, superoxide anion (O2\n\u2022?), hydroperoxyl radical (HO2\n\n\u2022), H2O2 and HS \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\ntriplet excited states (3HS*). Many photochemical reactions require molecular oxygen (O2) \n\nin the initial step, since O2 is a source of O2\n\u2022? or 1O2 in the presence of the photosensitizer \n\nand visible light (Bancirova, 2011). The mechanism of 1O2 formation involves the energy \n\ntransfer between 3HS* and the O2 (Aguer et al., 1999), (Hessler et al., 1996). \n\nHowever, the effect of HS on the pollutants photodegradation is complicated because \n\nit acts as photosensitizer, light filter and quencher of free radicals. As an example, the \n\nformation of some of these reactive species, during the irradiation of HA, is represented in \n\nthe below mechanisms:  \n\n  \n\n      HA + h? 1HA* 3HA*    Eq. 1 \n\n                                                            3HA* + O2 HA + \n1O2   Eq. 2 \n\n 3HA* + O2 HA\n+ + O2\n\n?   Eq. 3 \n\n 2O2\n?- + 2H+ H2O2 + O2   Eq. 4 \n\n                                       H2O2 + h? 2\n?OH   Eq. 5 \n\n \n\n However, HA can also act as a light-filtering agent and/or a free radical quencher to \n\ninhibit degradation as shown in the next equation: \n\n \n\n                      HA/1HA*/3HA*/HA+ + ?OH Oxidized HA Eq. 6 \n\n  \n\nSo, the overall effect of HA on the photodegradation of compounds depends on the \n\ncompetition between the opposing roles.  \n\nChen et al. (2013) concluded that the HA photoactivated species (1HA*, 3HA*, HA+) \n\nare more efficient free radical quenchers than the parent HA. So, an increased free radical \n\nquenching efficiency and light screening effect led to an inhibition on the photodegradation \n\nof E3, which means that the HA had an impact in the indirect photodegradation of E3. In \n\nthis study, it was found for the first time that the enhancement or inhibition role of HA in the \n\nphotodegradation depended on the incident light intensity. HA accelerated the degradation \n\nas a photosensitizer under weak irradiation. In contrast, under the high incident light \n\nintensity, HA inhibited the photodegradation due to light screening and free radical \n\nquenching effects.  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nIt was reported in different studies that the photodegradation of estrone (E1), 17?-\n\nestradiol (E2) and E3 was enhanced in the presence of HS (Caupos et al., 2011), (Lin and \n\nReinhard, 2005), (Oliveira et al., 2016), (Silva, 2014). However, under simulated light, the \n\ninhibition effect of HS on photodegradation of E1 was also reported (Atkinson et al., 2011). \n\nSo, it was speculated that the differences in quality and type of DOM resulted in the different \n\neffects (Atkinson et al., 2011). In some studies were shown the distinct effects of HS on the \n\nphotodegradation of pollutants under simulated sunlight (Chen et al., 2009), (Ge et al., \n\n2009), (Yuan et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n1.3. Objectives of the dissertation  \n\n \n\n The presence of SMX in the aquatic environment around the world was confirmed by \n\nthe different studies presented. In addition, there is already some knowledge about the \n\nharmful effects of SMX, since it belongs to the group of antibiotics and therefore there is a \n\nrisk of developing bacterial resistance. Consequently, the removal of this pharmaceutical \n\nfrom the aquatic environment is urgent.  \n\n So, the aims of this work are: \n\n1)  To study the SMX photodegradation behavior under simulated solar irradiation and \n\nthus to verify whether photodegradation may be an effective method for the removal \n\nof this antibiotic from effluents of STPs. The photodegradation rates of SMX will be \n\nfollowed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection \n\n(HPLC-FLD).  \n\n2)  To evaluate the effect of natural photosensitizers in the photodegradation, because \n\nit is known that these can influence the degradation rate of pharmaceuticals. So, the \n\nHA, FA and styrene divinylbenzene (XAD-4) fractions extracted from an estuarine \n\nwater stream were chosen to evaluate indirect photodegradation caused by organic \n\nmatter (OM) present in aquatic environments.  \n\n3)  To understand the photodegradation behavior of SMX in the natural aquatic \n\nenvironment and due to the differences in the content and nature of DOM, salinity, \n\nsamples from different origins (estuarine, fresh and waste waters samples) will be \n\ncollected and used in this work. Several factors that might influence the \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nphotodegradation kinetics of SMX will also be studied, such as pH, salinity and \n\npresence of inorganic compounds, such as calcium and magnesium, important \n\nconstituents of sea water. \n\n4) To evaluate the antibacterial activity before and after photodegradation to \n\nunderstand the consequences of this proposed method on combating bacterial \n\nresistance. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n2.1. Chemicals  \n\n \n\nSMX ? C10H11N3O3S (purity > 98 %) used in these studies was provided by TCI \n\n(Europe). Ultrapure water, used in the preparation of solutions, was obtained from a \n\nMillipore system (Milli-Q plus 185).  \n\nAcetonitrile (HPLC grade) and acetic acid (p.a.) used for HPLC analysis, were \n\nobtained from VWR, Prolabo and Merck, respectively. Methanol (99.99 %) and nitric acid \n\n(>65 %) were purchased from Fisher Chemical and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. \n\nThe pH solutions were adjusted using hydrochloric acid ? HCl (NormaPur, 37 %) and \n\nsodium hydroxide ? NaOH (ABSOLVE, 99.3 %) solutions.  \n\nThe stock solution of phosphate buffer 0.1 M was prepared in ultrapure water from \n\nthe mixture of 0.05 mol of sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate ? NaH2PO4.2H2O (Fluka, \n\nBiochemika, ? 99.5 %) and 0.05 mol of di-sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate ? \n\nNa2HPO4.2H2O (Fluka, Biochemika, ? 99 %) for each litre of buffer.  \n\nThe Red Sea Salt and sodium chloride ? NaCl (99.3 %) were acquired from Red Sea \n\nEurope and ABSOLVE, respectively.   \n\nCalcium chloride dihydrate ? CaCl2.2H2O (p.a.) and magnesium chloride hexahydrate \n\n? MgCl2.6H2O (p.a.) were provided from Merck and Riedel-de-Ha\u00ebn, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Instrumentation  \n\n \n\nSolar radiation simulator (Solarbox) \n\nAll samples were irradiated under simulated solar radiation using a Solarbox 1500 \n\n(Co.fo.me.gra, Italy). The irradiation device contained an arc xenon lamp (1500 W) and \n\noutdoor UV filters that limited the transmission of light with wavelengths below 290 nm. The \n\nirradiance of the lamp was set to 55 W/m2 (290-400) nm and was kept constant during all \n\nthe experiments. To monitor the irradiance level and temperature, a multimeter \n\n(Co.fo.me.gra, Italy), equipped with a UV (290-400) nm large band sensor and a black \n\nstandard temperature sensor, was used. Through an air-cooled system, the device was \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nrefrigerated. Furthermore, a parabolic reflection system guaranteed the uniformity of the \n\nirradiation inside the chamber. \n\n  \n\nHPLC-FLD \n\nQuantitative analysis of SMX was achieved using a HPLC-FLD. This device consisted \n\nof a degasser DGU-20A5R, a column oven CTO-10AC, a pump LC-30AD and an \n\nautosampler SIL-30AC (all from Shimadzu). For the separation, a Kinetex XB-C18 column \n\n(2.6 ?m, 100 mm x 4.60 mm) was used. Both the cell and column temperature were \n\nmaintained at 25 \u00b0C and an injection of 20 \u00b5L was used. The mobile phase consisted of \n\nwater (acidified with 1 % acetic acid):acetonitrile mixture (40:60, v/v) and the flow rate was \n\nmaintained at 0.8 mL/min. Before use as mobile phase, water with 1 % of acetic acid and \n\nacetonitrile were filtered through a 0.2 ?m polyamide membrane filters (Whatman). The \n\ndetection of SMX was done by using a Prominence RF-20Axs fluorescence detector from \n\nShimadzu with an excitation wavelength of 265 nm and an emission wavelength of 343 nm. \n\n \n\nConductivity, pH and salinity \n\nConductivity was measured using a Consort C861 multi-parameter analyser at 25 \u00baC. \n\nSalinity and pH were measured using a MASTER REFRACTOMETER, from ATAGO and a \n\npH/mV/\u00b0C meter pHenomenal\u00ae pH 1100L from VWR.  \n\n  \n\nUV-Vis spectrophotometer and DOC \n\nAll UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectra were obtained with a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC \n\nspectrometer using rectangular quartz cuvettes with an optical path length of 1 cm, between \n\n200 and 800 nm. \n\nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured using a Total Organic Carbon \n\nanalyser, TOC-VCPH, from Shimadzu, where samples were acidified with 2 % (v/v) of HCl 2 \n\nM, purged with nitrogen and covered with Parafilm M\u00ae, previously to the analysis. \n\nStock solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHC8H4O4) 1000 mg/L was prepared \n\nby dissolving 0.2125 g of KHC8H4O4 in 100 mL of ultrapure water.  \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nCalibration curve, used for quantification of DOC in different samples throughout the \n\nexperimental work, were performed using standard solutions of KHC8H4O4 in ultrapure \n\nwater (0.0-10.0 mg/L), by dilution of proper amounts of the stock solution.  \n\nThe coefficient of determination (R2) and limit of detection (LOD) for the calibration \n\ncurve obtained were 0.9984 and 0.613 mg/L, respectively. To confirm the stability of \n\ncalibration curve, everyday a newly prepared standard solution [5.0 mg/L] of KHC8H4O4 was \n\nprepared and analyzed before the samples analysis. \n\n \n\nAtomic absorption spectrophotometer \n\nTo determine metals in environmental water samples by flame atomic absorption \n\nspectroscopy (air-acetylene) an atomic absorption spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer, \n\nAnalyst 100 was used.  \n\nFor this determination, water samples were filtered, using a membrane filter (0.2 \u00b5m, \n\nNL16 Whatman) and acidified with nitric acid to pH ? 2 (adding 200 \u00b5L of nitric acid 65 % to \n\n100 mL of sample). The samples were refrigerated until the analysis. Before determination \n\nof dissolved metals, the material used was previously washed with HNO3 4 M followed by \n\nultrapure water to prevent the contamination with metals ions. \n\nTo quantify the dissolved calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and iron by the \n\nflame atomic absorption method, calibration curves were made for each element. For \n\ncalcium and magnesium determination, six standards were prepared by dilution of proper \n\namounts of the stock solution 100 and 10 mg/L, respectively, in ultrapure water. Due to the \n\npossibility of complexation, for the calcium and magnesium determinations, 500 \u00b5L of \n\nlanthanum chloride (LaCl2) 0.10 % were added to 50 mL of samples and standard solutions. \n\nAlso, six standards were prepared by dilution of proper amounts of the stock solution \n\n1000 mg/L in ultrapure water for sodium determination. For minimize the ionization of \n\nsodium, 400 \u00b5L of KCl 25 % were added to 50 mL of samples and standard solutions. For \n\npotassium and iron determination, four standards were prepared by dilution of proper \n\namounts of the stock solution 400 and 100 mg/L, respectively, in ultrapure water.  \n\n \n\nSpectrofluorometer \n\n All fluorescence spectra were acquired with a spectrofluorometer FluoroMax-4 \n\n(Horiba Jobin Yvon) and a quartz cell with an optical path length of 1 cm was used as \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nsample container. The excitation and emission wavelengths ranged from (200-540) nm and \n\nfrom (210-600) nm, respectively. Excitation and emission slits of 10 nm and an increment \n\nof 5 nm were chosen to acquire the spectra.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3. Humic substances \n\n \n\nTo study the effect of OM on SMX photodegradation, three fractions of HS were used \n\nto simulate dissolved organic matter (DOC) in the aquatic environment, since these \n\nsubstances are aquatic origin. These fractions, HA, FA and XAD-4, were extracted and \n\nisolated by Esteves (1995) from an estuarine stream that flows into the Aveiro lagoon, \n\nPortugal, during low tide at the bar entrance of Aveiro (Portugal) at 40\u00ba31\u201916\u2019\u2019N and \n\n8\u00ba46\u201934\u2019\u2019W.  \n\nDifferent fractions of HS were previously (Esteves, 1995) extracted and isolated using \n\na system of two resins in series - poly(methymetacrylate) (XAD-8) followed by XAD-4. After \n\nthe isolation of HA and FA using the XAD-8 column, an additional step was applied to isolate \n\nthe hydrophilic organic acids using the XAD-4 styrene resin, being the obtained substances \n\ncalled XAD-4 fraction (Esteves et al., 2009). The purified fractions of HS were subsequently \n\ncharacterized by elemental analysis by Esteves (1995).  \n\nIn this work, UV-Vis spectrophotometry was used for HS fractions\u2019 characterization.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.  Environmental water samples \n\n \n\nSurface and waste water samples were collected in cleaned ambar glass bottles \n\nbetween October 2016 and February 2017 with the purpose of studying the SMX \n\nphotodegradation in environmental aquatic matrices.  \n\nA surface estuarine water sample was collected from Ria de Aveiro, more precisely \n\nin the urban city center of Aveiro (Fonte Nova, Ria de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal). In this \n\nsampling site, water is typically known to have high contents of OM and salinity. Ria de \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nAveiro is a shallow lagoon (about 1 m of depht) situated in the Northwest Atlantic coast of \n\nPortugal (40\u00ba38\u2019N, 8\u00ba45\u2019W) with 45 km length and 10 km width. The lagoon receives fresh \n\nwater from two main rivers, the Antu\u00e3 river with average flow of 5 m3/s and the Vouga river \n\nwith 50 m3/s. In addition to the rivers mentioned above, Ria de Aveiro has a number of \n\nchannels and among them two are more important, the S\u00e3o Jacinto and Espinheiro \n\nchannels. This lagoon covers an area of 83 km2 at high tide and 66 km2 at low tide. Ria de \n\nAveiro was affected by the increase of anthropogenic activities, namely building and land \n\noccupation, agricultural and industrial activities, leading to a significant change of the lagoon \n\nmorphology, with the addition of anthropogenic nutrients and contaminants. Thus, there is \n\na negative impact on the water circulation, as well as on the water quality of the lagoon. The \n\nmain anthropogenic sources of pollution are domestic and industrial discharge flows (Lima, \n\n2011).  \n\nOther surface water samples were tested: a fresh water from Rio Novo do Pr\u00edncipe \n\n(Aveiro, Portugal), located in the rural and agricultural area of Aveiro and a fresh water from \n\nPo\u00e7o da Cruz (Aveiro, Portugal), belonging to the Mira channel. Finally, a waste water \n\nsample was collected from the North Aveiro STP, after secondary treatment (corresponding \n\nto the final effluent, STPF). In Aveiro, there are two STPs (North and South of Aveiro) where \n\ndomestic (South STP) and both domestic and industrial (North STP) effluents from 10 \n\ndifferent locations are treated and discharged into the Atlantic Ocean, at a distance of \n\n3.2 Km from the coast, at approximately 17 m depth. North STP is located in Cacia, Aveiro, \n\nand was projected to satisfy the effluents\u2019 treatment needs of \u00c1gueda, Aveiro (part of), \n\nAlbergaria-a-Velha, Estarreja, Murtosa, Oliveira do Bairro and Ovar. It is dimensioned to \n\nserve a population of 272 000 inhabitants and an average daily flow of 48 705 m3 and \n\nperforms the treatment of both domestic and industrial effluents (Lima, 2011).  \n\nAll sampling sites are represented in figure 5.  \n\nAfter collection, all the samples were filtered through 0.22 ?m nitrocellulose \n\nmembrane filters (Millipore) avoiding bacteria activity and stored at 4 ?C prior to use.  \n\nAll water samples were characterized through UV-Vis spectrophotometry, atomic \n\nabsorption spectrophotometry and measuring different parameters, such as DOC, salinity, \n\npH and conductivity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5. Photodegradation experiments \n\n \n\n2.5.1. Solutions of SMX \n\nSMX stock solution of 100 mg/L was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of SMX in a small \n\nquantity of methanol (less than 1 %) and stored at 4 \u00b0C in the dark.  \n\nThe SMX calibration curve was obtained by preparation of standard solutions in \n\nultrapure water, with concentrations 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 ?g/L, by dilution of proper \n\namounts of the stock solution.  \n\nFor the evaluation of the antibacterial activity of SMX and its photoproducts, a \n\n400 mg/L aqueous standard stock solution of SMX was prepared by dissolving SMX in a \n\nsmall volume of methanol (less than 1 %). Solutions were kept at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. \n\nSTPF Fonte nova \n\nRio Novo Pr\u00edncipe \n\nPo\u00e7o da cruz \n\nFigure 5- Location of the sampling points. \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n2.5.2. Photodegradation of SMX in batch mode \n\nGeneral procedure of SMX photodegradation  \n\nThe SMX photodegradation studies were performed using quartz tubes (1.8 cm \n\ninternal diameter and height of 20 cm) containing the compound solution. Thereafter, the \n\ntubes were placed on a suitable support to be maintained in suspension inside the \n\nirradiation chamber and subjected to irradiation making use of the Solarbox. For each set \n\nof experiments, four properly identified quartz tubes capped with Parafilm M\u00ae were \n\nintroduced into the Solarbox: three of them were exposed to radiation and the other one \n\nwas covered with aluminum foil to protect it from light (control). The controls were kept \n\ninside the Solarbox during the same time as the irradiated solutions. These controls will \n\nindicate the existence or not of any degradation by microbiological or thermal means, during \n\nthe photodegradation experiments. Therefore, the decrease of SMX concentration in \n\nexposed solutions, as compared with controls, may be only ascribed to photo-induced \n\ndegradation.  \n\nFor kinetic studies, from each irradiated samples and controls, 1 mL aliquot was \n\ncollected after 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes; then every hour until 8 \n\nhours, after 10 hours of irradiation and then every 4 hours until no SMX was detected using \n\nHPLC-FLD.  \n\nThe degradation percentage for each set of experiments was calculated in relation \n\nwith the respective control. Experimental data was fitted to the pseudo first-order kinetic \n\nequation given below, using GraphPad Prism 5.:  \n\n                                      C?C0 = e-kt                                                                                                                                         Eq. 7 \n\n \n\nwhere,   \n\nC ? is the concentration of SMX exposed to light at different irradiation times (\u00b5g/L);  \n\nC0 ? is the concentration of SMX protected to light at different irradiation times (\u00b5g/L);  \n\nk ? is the pseudo first-order degradation rate constant (h-1);  \n\nt ? is time (h).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n The determination quantum yield of photodegradation (?) was performed by \n\nradiometry using the method described by Calisto et al.

Taking into account that one Ein is equivalent to one mole of photons, the ? is a \n\ndimensionless quantity. \n\n The SMX\u2019s photodegradation ? was calculated considering an overall average over \n\nthe lamp emission wavelength range (290\u2013800) nm and respective emission intensities, \n\ndirectly extracted from the lamp spectrum (as given by the manufacturer), for the irradiance \n\nlevel used during the experiments (55 W m-2, 290\u2013800 nm). The calculation of the ? was \n\nperformed considering a diameter of the cylindrical photoreactor of 1.8 cm, a volume of \n\nirradiated solution of 20 mL and a solution exposure area of 36 cm2. \n\n \n\nPhotodegradation of SMX in ultrapure water \n\nFor the direct phototodegradation of SMX, a solution of 100 ?g/L SMX, \n\nenvironmentally relevant concentration, in ultrapure water was prepared by dilution of the \n\nstock solution and transferred into quartz tubes (20 mL in each tube). The aliquots were \n\ncollected at different times of irradiation, as described above, until a maximum of 3 hours of \n\nirradiation. \n\n \n\nPhotodegradation of SMX in environmental water samples    \n\nWith the objective to study the SMX photodegradation when present in the aquatic \n\nenvironment, each one of the four environmental water samples collected was spiked with \n\n100 ?g/L of SMX. These solutions were distributed into quartz tubes and the aliquots in \n\nFonte Nova, Rio Novo do Pr\u00edncipe, Po\u00e7o da Cruz and STPF samples, were collected as \n\ndescribed previously until no SMX was detected. \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n  \n\nEffect of HS on SMX photodegradation \n\nTo study the effect of HS on the SMX photodegradation, kinetic studies were \n\nperformed using three fractions of HS (HA, FA and XAD-4). The SMX solutions of 100 ?g/L \n\nwere prepared in the presence of 20 mg/L of HA, FA or XAD-4 and subjected to irradiation \n\nuntil no SMX was detected.   \n\n \n\nEffect of pH on SMX photodegradation \n\nSeveral experiments were performed to study the influence of pH in aqueous solutions \n\non SMX photodegradation.  \n\nFirstly, a 100 \u00b5g/L of SMX solution prepared in a 0.001 M phosphate buffer with pH \n\n5.00 and 7.30 adjusted with NaOH or HCl was irradiated until no SMX was detected using \n\nHPLC-FLD and aliquots were collected at different times following the order described \n\nabove.  \n\nSecondly, an estuarine water sample spiked with 100 \u00b5g/L SMX with no pH \n\nadjustment (pH = 7.33) and with pH adjusted to 6.30 with HCl was also irradiated until no \n\nSMX was detected using HPLC-FLD.  \n\nAt last, SMX solutions (100 ?g/L) in absence and presence of each one of the three \n\nfractions of HS (HA, FA and XAD-4) at a concentration of 20 mg/L prepared in a 0.001 M \n\nphosphate buffer with pH 5.00 and 7.30 adjusted with NaOH or HCl were irradiated until no \n\nSMX was detected by HPLC-FLD. \n\n \n\nEffect of sea salts on SMX photodegradation \n\nThe influence of sea salts on photodegradation behaviour was evaluated using \n\n100 ?g/L of SMX, dissolved in 0.001 M phosphate buffer with pH adjusted to 7.30 containing \n\n21 \u2030 of NaCl or 21 \u2030 of sea salts (artificial sea water from Red Sea Salts). Both solutions \n\nwere irradiated during 5 hours and analysed with HPLC-FLD. Results were compared with \n\nthe ones obtained using an estuarine water sample spiked with 100 \u00b5g/L SMX and an \n\nultrapure water with phosphate buffer at pH 7.30. \n\nIn order to obtain information on the possibility of inorganic compounds (such as \n\ncalcium and magnesium) playing a role in the photodegradation of SMX, the following \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nexperiment was conducted: 100 \u00b5g/L SMX solutions in 0.001 M phosphate buffer with pH \n\nadjusted to 7.30 with NaOH and containing 785 mg/L of magnesium or 261 mg/L of calcium \n\nwere also irradiated during 5 hours and analysed with HPLC-FLD. These concentrations of \n\nmagnesium and calcium were chosen because they are similar to the existing on Red Sea \n\nSalts mentioned previously. \n\nTo test the possible influence of ionic strength photodegradation, kinetics of the \n\nphotodegradation of SMX was also performed using 21 \u2030 of sea salts (artificial sea water \n\nfrom Red Sea Salts) and using 21 \u2030 of NaCl spiked with 100 ?g/L of SMX, dissolved in \n\n0.001 M phosphate buffer with pH adjusted to 7.30 with NaOH and irradiated until a \n\nmaximum of 18 hours. Results were compared with those obtained in previous sections \n\nusing an estuarine water sample spiked with 100 \u00b5g/L SMX at pH 7.33 and an ultrapure \n\nwater with phosphate buffer at pH 7.30. \n\n \n\n2.5.3. Photodegradation of SMX in continuous flow mode \n\nTo study the SMX photodegradation in continuous flow mode, solutions of the \n\ncompound kept in two reservoirs with 20 mL each were capped with Parafilm M\u00ae and \n\ncovered with aluminum foil to protect them from light. The samples were pumped with a \n\nLonger Pump BT 100-1L, using a flow rate of 150.1 \u00b5L/min, through a narrow-bore (inner \n\ndiameter: 0.8 mm and outer diameter: 1.6 mm), transparent tube of fluorinated ethylene \n\npropylene. Each one of the two tubes used had a total lenght of 2.80 m, however, just \n\n1.50 m were placed in a flat plate inside the solarbox, while the rest of the tube was outside, \n\nto allow sample recirculation. It is important to refer that the reservoirs and part of the tubes \n\nthat were outside the solarbox were all carefully covered with aluminum foil to protect them \n\nfrom light. One of the two plates were covered with aluminum foil to protect it from light \n\n(control). The scheme used to study the photodegradation in continuous flow mode is \n\nrepresented in figure 6. The control was kept inside the Solarbox during the same time as \n\nthe irradiated flat plate containing the solution. During the photodegradation experiments, \n\nthese controls were used to verify that there was not another type of degradation or \n\nadsorption to the inner walls of the tube besides photodegradation. So, the decrease of \n\nSMX concentration in exposed solutions may only be ascribed to photo-induced \n\ndegradation. \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6- Scheme of SMX photodegradation in continuos flow mode. \n\n \n\nResidence time plays a significant role in the complete degradation of the target \n\ncompound. So, to build the kinetic profile of SMX degradation, samples with 100 \u00b5g/L were \n\ntested with different residence times, being varied by several consecutive cycles.  \n\nFor the direct phototodegradation of SMX, a solution of 100 ?g/L of SMX in ultrapure \n\nwater was prepared by dilution of the stock solution and transferred to two reservoirs (5 mL \n\nin each). The aliquots were collected at different times of irradiation as described above \n\nuntil a maximum of 1 hour of irradiation. \n\nWith the objective to study the SMX photodegradation when present in the aquatic \n\nenvironment, each one of four environmental water samples collected was spiked with \n\n100 ?g/L of SMX. These filtered solutions were distribued into reservoirs and the aliquots \n\nof Fonte Nova, Rio Novo do Pr\u00edncipe, Po\u00e7o da Cruz and STPF samples, were collected as \n\ndescribed previously until a maximum of 5, 4, 4 and 5 hours of irradiation, respectively.  \n\nFrom each one of the irradiated samples and controls, 200 \u00b5L aliquot was collected \n\nafter 3, 6, 9, 15, 21, 30, 45 and 60 minutes; then every 30 minutes until 3 hours and then \n\nevery hour until no SMX was detected using HPLC-FLD.  \n\nThe degradation percentage for each set of experiments was calculated in relation \n\nwith the respective control and to perform the fittings of experimental data the same \n\nequation as in SMX photodegradation in batch mode was used.   \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n2.5.4. Antibacterial activity \n\nBefore performing the antibacterial activity tests, SMX photodegradation experiments \n\nwere done using five tubes placed inside the solarbox in the same way as referred in 2.5.2 \n\nsection. All quartz tubes were capped with Parafilm M\u00ae and two of these tubes were covered \n\nwith aluminum foil to protect them from light (controls).  \n\nFor the direct phototodegradation of SMX, a solution of 100 mg/L of SMX, \n\nconcentration needed to detect bacterial growth, in ultrapure water was prepared by dilution \n\nof the stock solution and transferred to four quartz tubes (20 mL each). \n\nWith the aim of studying the antibacterial activity of SMX in aquatic environment \n\nduring the photodegradation process, each one of three environmental water samples \n\ncollected was spiked with 100 mg/L of SMX and these solutions were distributed into four \n\nquartz tubes.  \n\nAliquots of the three replicates were collected after about 50 % of SMX \n\nphotodegradation (t1 \u2013 sample E), after more than 95 % of SMX photodegradation (t2 \u2013 \n\nsample F) and when no SMX was detected (t3 \u2013 sample G) by HPLC-FLD. All concentrations \n\nof SMX in ultrapure water and in environmental water samples at different times of \n\nirradiation used for antibacterial activity tests are on the table A1 (annex).  \n\nOne of the dark controls (sample D) consisted in a SMX solution of 100 mg/L in the \n\nwater matrix subjected to the irradiation and the aliquots were collected at zero time of \n\nirradiation to evaluate the antibacterial activity and t1, t2 and t3 of irradiation for analysis by \n\nHPLC-FLD to calculate the photodegradation rate and to evaluate the existence or not of \n\nany degradation by microbiological or thermal means, during the photodegradation \n\nexperiments. The other control (sample C), with an expected SMX concentration \n\ncorresponding to 50 % of degradation, was used to evaluate the existence of any loss of \n\nantibacterial activity due to thermal heat that samples might be subjected.  \n\nA 5 mL blank of the water matrix (no SMX added) was used to evaluate matrix effects \n\non bioassays performance (sample A). Also, a 5 mL of a SMX standard with 50 % of the \n\ninitial concentration not subjected to any irradiation (sample B) was used to compare its \n\nantibacterial activity with the one obtained with 50 mg/L SMX solution in the water matrix \n\nsubjected to irradiation (containing any photoproducts formed during the irradiation).  \n\nThe tests of antibacterial activity were performed using Vibrio fischeri ATCC 7744 \n\nincubated overnight in Nutrient Broth n.2 supplemented with 2 % of NaCl. This strain was \n\nchosen to represent bacteria present in environmental waters and because it is known to \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nplay an important role in antibiotics\u2019 resistance dissemination (Cabral, 2010), (Chavez-dozal \n\net al., 2013), (Backhaus and Grimme, 1999). Its detection is favoured since it emits \n\nluminescence (Hamada, 2008).  \n\nThe strain was grown to optical density (OD) 0.9 at wavelength 600 nm and then was \n\nused in the bioassays in ultrapure water and in the different environmental water samples. \n\nAll assays were performed in triplicate. \n\nThe cytotoxic effect was evaluated considering the bacterial growth at a wavelength \n\nof 600 nm and its luminescence at a wavelength of 420 nm using a Multiskan \u2122 GO, \n\nThermo Scientific, UK.  \n\nFor the various samples tested, a growth control was performed, where the strain was \n\ngrown in the water sample under study without SMX (control - sample A). Then, the % of \n\nviable cells was estimated at wavelength 420 nm using the following ratio: \n\n \n\n                          % ?? ?????? ????? = (\n?.?.?? ????\n\n?.?.?? ?????? ?\n) \u00d7100                                Eq. 12 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Results and Discussion \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n3.1. Calibration curve  \n\n \n\nThe calibration curve was performed using six standard solutions of SMX with \n\nconcentrations ranging from (1 to 100) ?g/L and each standard was analysed in \n\nquadruplicate. These solutions were prepared by dilution of a 100 mg/L stock solution of \n\nSMX in ultrapure water and analysed by HPLC-FLD. \n\nThe equation used for SMX quantification and respective errors are presented below:  \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere,  \n\ny \u2013 is the peak area obtained by HPLC-FLD; \n\nx \u2013 is the concentration obtained at different times of irradiation.  \n\n \n\nThe calibration curve allowed to obtain the value of R2 of 0.9979 which confirms the \n\ngood linear response in the studied range of concentrations.  \n\nThe repeatability of retention time (tr) and peak areas were measured throught the \n\nrelative standard deviation (RSD) and values below 5.0 % were obtained proving the good \n\nrepeatability of the HPLC method. However, is also possible to calculate the LOD and the \n\nlinearity (Lin) of response of the method using the equations described below (Esteves et \n\nal., 2004), (Lima, 2011), (Miller and Miller, 2010): \n\n \n\n                                                    ???? = ? + 3 ??/?

Linearity obtained was 99.98 % suggesting that the method used is linear for the \n\nrange of concentrations tested.  \n\nThe results, obtained in the calibration procedure, allowed to determine the SMX \n\nconcentration in the samples subjected to irradiation needed to determine the \n\nphotodegradation rate. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\n3.2. Photodegradation of SMX in batch mode \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Direct photodegradation kinetics of SMX \n\nThe study of direct photodegradation of SMX was performed in ultrapure water to \n\ninvestigate the rate of degradation in the absence of OM or salts.  \n\nSo, the photodegradation of 100 \u00b5g/L of SMX prepared in ultrapure water was \n\ninvestigated irradiating the solution during 3 hours and results showed a decrease of SMX \n\nconcentration with time (figure 7).  \n\nThe experimental data were fitted by non-linear regression, according to the equation \n\n7, referred in the section 2.5.2.  \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n0\n\n50000\n\n100000\n\n150000\n\n200000\n\nTime (h)\n\nC\n/C\n\n0\n\nC\no\n\nn\ntro\n\nl A\nre\n\na\n\n \n\n \n\nTo calculate the t1/2 of SMX, the following equation was used: \n\n                                           ?1 2? =\n??2\n\n?\n                                                                            Eq. 18 \n\n \n\nPhotodegradation of SMX followed a pseudo first-order kinetic model with a rate \n\nconstant of (0.81 \u00b1 0.04) h-1 and a t1/2 of (0.86 \u00b1 0.03) h. No degradation was observed in \n\nthe tubes covered with aluminum foils (control tube), indicating that no degradation by \n\nmicrobiological or thermal means occurred. The same kinetic model was well adjusted for \n\nother studies of the photodegradation of E1 (Silva et al., 2016a), E2 (Silva et al., 2016b), \n\nFigure 7- Kinetics of SMX photodegradation in ultrapure water - direct photodegradation (x) and control during \n\nthe photodegradation experiment (?).  \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\n(Mazellier et al., 2008), (Liu and Liu, 2004), 17?-ethinylestradiol (EE2) (Silva et al., 2016b), \n\nE3 (Oliveira et al., 2016) and also of psychiatric pharmaceuticals (Calisto et al., 2011).  \n\nThe fast photodegradation of SMX in ultrapure water is in accordance with literature. \n\nFor example, in the study performed by Trovo et al. (2009), experiments were conducted in \n\na solar simulator equipped with a 1100 W xenon arc lamp and special filters restricting \n\ntransmission of light below 290 nm and a rapid decay of 40 % of the initial concentration of \n\nSMX (10 mg/L) solution prepared in distilled water was observed during the first 45 minutes \n\n(Trov\u00f3 et al., 2009). However, it is important to refer that the concentration of SMX used in \n\nthe mentioned study was higher than that used in this work.  \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Photodegradation of SMX in the environmental water samples \n\n3.2.2.1. Characterization of environmental water samples  \n\nIn order to understand the results of SMX photodegradation in environmental water \n\nsamples, the characterization of the samples collected was performed in terms of salinity \n\nlevels, conductivity, DOC, pH, UV-Vis spectrophotometry and quantification of different \n\ndissolved elements by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy.  \n\n \n\nSalinity, conductivity, DOC and pH \n\nSalinity, conductivity, DOC and pH values of the samples are presented in the table \n\n6.  \n\nSalinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water, being the salt compounds \n\nsodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate and sodium bicarbonate. The \n\nsample of Fonte Nova has the highest value while fresh waters samples show a value of \n\nzero (table 6). It should also be noted that the STPF sample shows a low value of salinity \n\ncomparing with the Fonte Nova sample (table 6). The values of salinity are in agreement \n\nwith conductivity, with higher value for Fonte Nova sample and lower value for the two fresh \n\nwaters samples (table 6).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\nDOC analysis (table 6) indicates a greater content of organic carbon in the fresh water \n\nriver Po\u00e7o da Cruz sample [134.74 mg/L] comparing with the other samples, being the fresh \n\nwater Rio Novo Pr\u00edncipe sample [3.14 mg/L] the one with lower organic carbon content.  \n\nThe pH measurements indicate that all environmental water samples are basic, with \n\npH values higher than 7. \n\n \n\nUV-Vis spectrophotometry \n\nWith respect to the UV-Vis spectrophotometry, larger absorbance values are most \n\nlikely caused by higher chromophore content. The obtained results (figure 8) show the same \n\ntrend for all water samples studied: decreasing of absorbance towards longer wavelengths.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8- UV-Vis spectra of the environmental water samples analysed.  \n\nSample Salinity \n\n(\u2030) \n\n \n\nConductivity \n\n(mS/cm) \n\nDOC [mg/L] pH \n\nFonte Nova 20.8  24.000 5.5 \u00b1 0.1 7.33  \n\nRio Novo Pr\u00edncipe 0.0  0.087 3.14 \u00b1 0.07 7.20  \n\nPo\u00e7o da Cruz 0.0  0.480 134.74 \u00b1 0.08 8.11  \n\nSTPF 2.0  2.820 26.45 \u00b1 0.03 8.08  \n\n Table 6- Salinity, conductivity, pH and DOC values of the samples tested and respective standard errors. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nThrough the investigated range of wavelenght, the highest absorbance values were \n\nobtained for STPF sample, while the lowest values were for Rio Novo Pr\u00edncipe sample.  \n\nTo investigate the influence of the environmental water samples in SMX \n\nphotodegradation, the absorbance values at 290 nm were measured in SMX (100 \u00b5g/L) \n\nsolutions in ultrapure water and in STPF, Rio Novo Pr\u00edncipe, Po\u00e7o da Cruz and Fonte Nova \n\nwater samples.

On the other hand, \n\nafter 14 hours of irradiation, the photodegradation of SMX in environmental water samples \n\nincreased as follow: STPF - 72.46 % &lt;Fonte Nova - 80.00 % &lt;Rio Novo Pr\u00edncipe - 81.65 % \n\n&lt;Po\u00e7o da Cruz - 86.77 %. However, in ultrapure water after only 3 hours of irradiation SMX \n\nwas practically all degraded.  \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nResults obtained are summarized in table 9 showing the different photodegradation \n\nbehaviour of SMX in environmental water samples from different origins. These results \n\nshowed that environmental water samples are less efficient to photodegradation of SMX, \n\nsince the t1/2 obtained in ultrapure water was lower than 1 hour, while in estuarine and \n\nriverine waters was around 6 hours and in STPF reached almost 8 hours (table 9).  \n\n \n\nTable 9- Data on apparent first-order rate constants, kmeas (h-1), R2, t1/2 (h), and t1/2 (SSD) obtained in ultrapure \n\nwater and in environmental water samples and respective standard errors.  \n\nType of water kmeas (h\n-1) R2 t\u00bd (h) t\u00bd (SSD) \n\nUltrapure 0.81 \u00b1 0.04 0.9900 0.86 \u00b1 0.04 0.23 \u00b1 0.01 \n\nFonte Nova 0.13 \u00b1 0.01 0.9397 5.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 \n\nRio Novo do Pr\u00edncipe 0.117 \u00b1 0.007 0.9701 5.9 \u00b1 0.4 1.56 \u00b1 0.09 \n\nPo\u00e7o da Cruz 0.122 \u00b1 0.004 0.9916 5.7 \u00b1 0.2 1.50 \u00b1 0.05 \n\nSTPF 0.092 \u00b1 0.003 0.9907 7.54 \u00b1 0.04 1.98 \u00b1 0.07 \n\n \n\nFor all environmental water samples, the first order rate constant of SMX \n\nphotodegradation was much lower than the one obtained in ultrapure water. Also, it was in \n\nthe STPF sample that the first order rate constant of SMX photodegradation was lower, \n\n(0.092 \u00b1 0.003) h-1, compared to the obtained in ultrapure water, (0.81 \u00b1 0.04) h-1. These \n\nresults can indicate that the high capacity of STPF sample to absorb radiation originates a \n\nsignificant amount of light not available for SMX degradation (higher inner filter effect). \n\nThese values are in accordance with the absorbance values determined for STPF which \n\nwere higher than those for fresh and estuarine water samples. \n\nIt is important to highlight that t1/2 is strictly related to the adopted experimental \n\nconditions and assuming that the lamp properly simulates sunlight, results can be converted \n\ninto outdoor t1/2, in summer sunny days (SSD) equivalents (table 9). Considering that the \n\ntotal energy reaching the ground on a cloudless summer day (45 \u00baN latitude) is \n\n7.5 x 105 J/m2, one summer sunny day (24 hours day/night cycle) corresponds to 3.8 hours \n\nof irradiation (Calisto et al., 2011). The conversion of the resulting t1/2 (h) to t1/2 (SSD) in \n\nenvironmental conditions, allows to observe enormous differences in the number of \n\nnecessary SSD to reach the t1/2 in ultrapure water and in environmental water samples. In \n\nultrapure water, 0.23 SSD are needed to reach the t1/2, while for natural environmental \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nsamples the SSD varied between 1.4 and 1.98. This means that when SMX is present in \n\nnatural environments its degradation rate becomes much slower, increasing its persistence, \n\nalong with potential risks, such as increasing microbial resistance through the prolonged \n\nexposure of microorganisms to SMX. Thus, it is important to understand the main \n\ncontributors for this decrease in the photodegradation rate. \n\nThe salinity of the samples used in this study ranged between 0, 2.0 and 20.8 for fresh \n\nwaters, STPF and estuarine water samples, respectively (table 6). The highest salinity was \n\nmeasured on Fonte Nova sample. A decrease of OM content with increasing of salinity has \n\nbeen proven (Yang et al., 2015). Since lower OM content will result in a lower inner filter \n\neffect, this can explain the higher degradation rate observed in Fonte Nova sample in \n\ncomparison with the observed in the other environmental samples. However, salinity also \n\nhas been known to have an inhibitory effect on the photocatalytic degradation of \n\nsulfonamide antibiotics (Yang et al., 2015), which may explain why the first order rate \n\nconstant of SMX photodegradation in Fonte Nova sample was much lower than the \n\nobtained in ultrapure water. Also, estuarine water contains various inorganic compounds \n\nthat are high in Na+ and Cl- ions and includes numerous other ions in minor concentrations \n\n(e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, I-, SO4\n2- and Br-) (Leal et al., 2015). In table 8, it is possible to verify \n\nthat estuarine water presents higher concentration of sodium, calcium, magnesium and \n\npotassium when compared with the other samples tested. As mentioned before, indirect \n\nphotolysis consists of light absorption by photosensitizers, which generate many \n\nphotoreactants, such as ?OH or 1O2. It has also been referred that anions such as chlorides, \n\ncarbonates, phosphates and sulphates have the ability to scavenge the ?OH (Umar and \n\nAziz, 2013) that may contribute in the indirect photodegradation, since the addition of the \n\n?OH to SMX isoxazole ring formation was mentioned by Trov\u00f3 et al., 2009. \n\nIn this study, the pH of environmental water samples varied between 7.20 and 8.11 \n\n(table 6); these values are higher than that attributed to 100 \u00b5g/L SMX in ultrapure water \n\n(pH = 6.30).  According to Dias et al. (2014), pH affects greatly the SMX speciation in \n\nsolution and thus its UV-Vis spectrum. Since photodegradation rate constant depends upon \n\nthe quantity of photons absorbed by each mole of SMX per unit of time and on the ?, it will \n\nalso depend of the SMX speciation.  \n\nSo, it is possible to conclude that salinity, the concentration of ions dissolved in \n\nenvironmental samples and pH have great influence in photodegradation rate of SMX, thus \n\nit is important to study their influence in more detail. In addition, the effect of \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nphotosensitizers, such as HS, should also be evaluated as they can influence \n\nphotodegradation.  \n\n \n\n3.2.3.  Effect of HS on SMX photodegradation \n\n3.2.3.1. Characterization of HS \n\nTo investigate the effect of HS on the SMX photodegradation, three fractions of HS \n\nwere used: HA, FA and XAD-4 at a concentration of 20 mg/L. Each one of the HS fractions \n\nhas different chemical and optical properties (Sierra et al., 2005) that can influence the \n\ndegree of SMX photodegradation.  \n\n \n\nElemental analysis \n\nThe purified fractions HA, FA and XAD-4 used in our photodegradation studies were \n\ncharacterized by Esteves et al. (1995) (table 10).   \n\n \n\nTable 10- Elemental analysis of HS fractions selected to study the effect of DOM on SMX photodegradation. \n\nResults are corrected for humidity at 60 ?C and ashes at 750  ?C (adapted from Esteves et al. (1995)). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter analyzing the elemental analysis results (table 10) it can be seen that XAD-4 \n\nfraction has a lower carbon content than HA and FA; however, the oxygen content of XAD-\n\n4 is higher. This indicates greater content of oxygen functional groups on XAD-4 fraction \n\nthan in the other two fractions used. \n\nHSs are complex molecules, which consist of aromatic cores, substituted with \n\nfunctional groups and aliphatic cores (Aleksandrova et al., 2011) with different heat \n\nresistance. In the thermogravimetric analysis HA, with the higher carbon content, was found \n\nElemental analysis (%)  \n\n C H N S O \n\nHA 54.8 4.0 3.6 1.8 32.4 \n\nFA 54.5 4.7 1.9 1.0 34.9 \n\nXAD-4 48.8 4.2 3.1 1.2 40.5 \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nto be the most thermo-resistant and only decomposes at temperatures higher than 300 \u00b0C, \n\nwhich suggests that this fraction have higher aromaticity and lower content of aliphatic \n\nchains and functional groups, comparing with FA and XAD-4 fractions (Esteves, 1995). \n\nTo further investigate the structural differences of the three fractions of HS used, UV-\n\nVis spectrophotometry (figure 11) were performed.  \n\n \n\nUV-Vis spectrophotometry \n\nThe UV-Vis spectra of SMX [100 \u00b5g/L] in ultrapure water and in the presence of the \n\nthree HS fractions were performed in the range (200 to 600) nm and show a continuous \n\ndecrease of absorbance values from (200 to 600) nm for all HS isolates (figure 11). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11- UV-Vis spectra of SMX in ultrapure water and in the three fractions of HS. \n\n \n\nThrough the observed range of absorbance, the highest values were obtained for HA, \n\nwhile the lowest were for XAD-4, which indicates the higher sensitivity of HA to absorb \n\nradiation. The same results were obtained previously in the study of HS from different origin \n\nby Esteves et al. (2009).   \n\nTo study the effect of HS on the photodegradation of SMX, the absorbance values at \n\n290 nm were measured in SMX solutions in absence of HS (ultrapure water) and in \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\npresence of HS (HA, FA and XAD-4 at 20 mg/L). The results showed the increase of \n\nabsorbance values in the order: \n\n \n\n????????? ????? (0.011) &lt;??? ? 4 (0.197) &lt;?? (0.225) &lt;?? (0.441) \n\n \n\nwhich can suggest that the rate of photodegradation of SMX in presence of HS could \n\ndecrease in the same order due to the inner filter effect of HS. \n\n \n\n3.2.3.2. Photodegradation kinetics of SMX \n\nThe studies of SMX photodegradation were performed in the presence of the three \n\nHS fractions (HA, FA and XAD-4), since the photodegradation of SMX can happen either \n\nas a direct phototransformation by absorption of light and/or be induced by the presence of \n\nHS. Photodegradation was performed using solutions containing 100 \u00b5g/L of SMX and \n\n20 mg/L of HA, FA or XAD-4 which were irradiated during 4, 3 and 2.5 hours, respectively. \n\nDark controls, obtained under the exact same conditions, were performed for all the \n\nirradiation experiments. Degradation in the dark due to thermal or hydrolytic processes was \n\nnot observed. \n\nThe experimental results were fitted using a non-linear regression, according to the \n\nequation 7, as for SMX photodegradation kinetic in ultrapure water. The SMX \n\nphotodegradation kinetic curves in presence of different HS fractions and kinetic curve in \n\nultrapure water (for comparison) are presented in figure 12. \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nUltrapure W ater\n\nHA\n\nFA\n\nXAD-4\n\nTime (h)\n\nC\n/C\n\n0\n\n \n\nFigure 12-  Kinetics of SMX photodegradation in absence and presence of three fractions of HS. Shown error \n\nbars are standard deviations (n=3) (note that, for most the experimental points, error bars are too small to be \n\nvisible in the figure). \n\n \n\nThe obtained data for the variation of SMX concentration along irradiation time was \n\nfitted to a pseudo first-order kinetic model and shows a significant impact of each of HS \n\nfractions studied on the SMX photodegradation (figure 12).  \n\nAddition of HA [20 mg/L] caused an apparent decrease of the SMX photodegradation \n\nrate compared with the one obtained in ultrapure water. On the other hand, the addition of \n\nXAD-4 [20 mg/L] caused a slight acceleration of the SMX photodegradation rate.  \n\nFor example, after 2 hours of irradiation, in ultrapure water, SMX was 81.83 % \n\ndegraded. However, after the same time of irradiation, the results of SMX photodegradation \n\nwere 71.78 %, 75.63 % and 91.19 % for HA, FA and XAD-4, respectively. These results \n\nshowed that XAD-4 is the most efficient to photoinduce the SMX degradation, which is in \n\naccordance with the expected low inner effect for this fraction of HS. Each one of the HS \n\nfractions studied absorb the radiation due to the presence of chromophores' moieties (inner \n\nfilter effect). Considering the UV-Vis spectra (figure 11), a low value of absorbance indicates \n\nthe weak ability to absorb radiation, which causes that a significant amount of light can be \n\navailable for SMX, resulting in an increase of its degradation. Therefore, if the generation \n\nof reactive species is not considered for the XAD-4 solution (since these moieties present \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\na weaker ability to absorb radiation), a higher SMX photodegradation will be expected in \n\nthis solution, when compared with the FA and HA solutions. So, the strongest \n\nphotoinductive properties were obtained for XAD-4, which resulted in a SMX t1/2 of \n\n(0.73 \u00b1 0.04) h compared to (0.86 \u00b1 0.04) h in ultrapure water. The t1/2 of SMX for the other \n\nHS was higher than the obtained in ultrapure water (t1/2 = (0.94 \u00b1 0.06) h and \n\nt1/2 = (1.05 \u00b1 0.05) h, for FA and HA fraction, respectively) (table 11).  \n\nIn the absence of HS, a first order rate constant of (0.81 \u00b1 0.04) h-1 was obtained \n\n(table 11), which corresponds to the direct photodegradation of SMX. According to Caupos \n\net al. (2011), the value of the rate constant in presence of HS can be calculated, considering \n\nthat they do not have any photosensitizing properties, thus acting only as inner filter. The \n\ncalculations of the initial fraction of light, absorbed by SMX alone and in presence of different \n\nHS fractions, were performed at 290 nm (at the higher absorbance of SMX in the spectral \n\nrange of simulated sunlight), using the equation below: \n\n \n\n                                                              (\n??\n\n?0\n)\n\n???\n??\n\n= (\n??\n\n?0\n)\n\n?\n\u00d7\n\n????\n\n??\n                                                 Eq. 19 \n\nwhere, \n\n(\n??\n\n?0\n)\n\n???\n??\n\n\u2013  is the fraction of light that was absorbed by SMX in presence of HS at 290 nm; \n\n(\n??\n\n?0\n)\n\n?\n \u2013 is the fraction of light absorbed by the mixture (SMX + HS) at 290 nm; \n\n???? \u2013 is the value of absorbance of SMX at 290 nm (constant due to the constant value of \n\nthe concentration); \n\n?? \u2013 is the absorbance value of the mixture (SMX + HS) at 290 nm. \n\nSince the intensity of light absorbed depends on the absorbance value and the \n\nintensity of incident light, the ratio  \n??\n\n?0\n can be calculated, by using the following equation: \n\n \n\n                              ?? = ?0(1 ? 10\n??)                                                             Eq. 20 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\nIn presence of HS, the radiation emitted by the lamp is mainly absorbed by HS \n\nfractions. As it was mentioned before, it is possible to calculate the first order rate constant \n\nof SMX degradation in the presence of HS acting only as an inner filter (???? ), using the \n\nfollowing equation:  \n\n                                         ???? = ????\u00d7\n(\n\n??\n?0\n\n)\n???\n\n??\n\n(\n??\n?0\n\n)\n???\n\n                                                     Eq. 21 \n\n \n\nwhere, \n\n(\n??\n\n?0\n)\n\n???\n?  is the fraction of light absorbed by SMX alone (in ultrapure water); \n\n ???? ? is the first order rate constant of SMX direct photolysis (in absence of HS). \n\n \n\nCombination of equations (19), (20) and (21) leads to calculate first order rate \n\nconstant of SMX photodegradation in presence of HS fractions, as follows:  \n\n \n\n                                    ???? = ????\u00d7\n(1?10??)\n\n?\n\n(1?10??)\n???\n\n\u00d7\n????\n\n??\n                                         Eq. 22 \n\n \n\nThe contribution to photodegradation of each one of the three different isolates of HS \n\nwas also studied and calculated using the next equation: \n\n  \n\n                                   ???????????? ?? ??

The \n\nreal effect of HS in photodegration rate is obtained by the combination of these two effects \n\n(Andreozzi et al., 2003). The inner filter effect should be dominant for HA and FA fractions, \n\nbecause a decrease rate in the photodegradation rate was observed, with a first order rate \n\nconstant of (0.66 \u00b1 0.03) h-1 and (0.74 \u00b1 0.04) h-1, respectively. Results suggest an inverse \n\ncorrelation between the HS aromaticity and their effect on photodegradation. HS \n\ncharacterization (table 10) indicated that HA must be the most hydrophobic fraction, more \n\nenriched in aromatic and/or chromophoric groups. On the other hand, results showed that \n\nXAD-4 fraction is the type of OM that seems to produce the higher number of reactive \n\nspecies, which can be explained by the greater content of oxygen functional groups, \n\nsuggested by elemental analysis, where XAD-4 fraction presented a lower carbon content \n\nthan HA and FA and a higher oxygen content (table 10).  \n\nThe kcalc values for the photodegradation of SMX in presence of HS were 0.51 h\n-1, \n\n0.63 h-1 and 0.65 h-1 for HA, FA and XAD-4, respectively. So, HA has the lowest value of \n\nKcal, which indicates the high ability to act as inner filter. Consequently, a significant amount \n\nof light is not available for SMX, which results in a decrease of its photodegradation. The \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nfact that a decrease in SMX photodegradation rate was verified for HA and FA fractions, is \n\ndue to the fact that the inner filter effect (that decreases the photodegradation rate of the \n\ntarget compound) is higher for these fractions, than their photosensitizing capacity (that \n\nincreases the photodegradation rate of the target compound). This effect is more evident in \n\nthe HA fraction with higher absorbance at 290 nm. The opposite is observed for the XAD-4 \n\nfraction. \n\nThe results show how important the presence of HS is on the photodegradation of \n\nSMX, as well as the type of HS fraction, that has also some effect on the SMX degradation \n\nrate. The highest contribution of XAD-4 (about 32 %), in the photodegradation of SMX, has \n\nbeen proven, which resulted in a lower t1/2. It means that about 32 % of the overall SMX \n\ndegradation is caused by photosensitized reactions. Lower contribution of HS, was obtained \n\nfor HA and FA fractions, about 23 % and 15 %, respectively.  \n\nThe conversion of the resulting t1/2 (h) to t1/2 (SSD) allows the determination of the t1/2 \n\nof SMX in environmental conditions, being possible to observe the differences in the number \n\nof necessary SSD to reach the t1/2 in presence or absence of HS fractions. In ultrapure water \n\n0.23 SSD are needed to reach t1/2, while when SMX is in presence of HS fractions the SSD \n\nvaried between 0.19 and 0.28 SSD, being the lower value of SSD observed in presence of \n\nXAD-4. \n\nOther authors reported an increase on photodegradation rate for estrogens due to \n\nphotosensitizing reactions induced by the presence of this type of organic matter (Oliveira \n\net al., 2016), (Silva et al., 2016a), (Silva et al., 2016b), while for other compounds, namely \n\nantibiotics, a decrease in the presence of this type of organic matter was observed (Leal et \n\nal., 2015). For less hydrophobic compounds the screening effect seems to be the reason \n\nfor the delaying effect on photodegradation, while for hydrophobic compounds this decrease \n\ncan also be attributed to hydrophobic association between the organic pollutant and the HS \n\npromoting the decay of excited state of pollutant (Leal et al., 2015).  \n\n \n\n3.2.4.  Effect of pH on SMX photodegradation  \n\n3.2.4.1. Importance of pH  \n\nAn important parameter in the photodegradation is the pH of the dispersion, which will \n\ninfluence the distribution of pollutant charges. Depending on the nature of the organic \n\ncompound, an increase in the pH will have a positive or negative effect on its \n\nphotodegradation rate.  \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nSMX has two pKa values (1.85 and 5.60) and the chemical structures change with pH \n\naccording to figure 13.  \n\n \n\nAccording to the species distribution (figure 14), the molar ratio between SMX species \n\ndepends on pH. At pH 1.0 around 88 % of SMX is in the protonated species, while at pH \n\n4.0 almost 97 % is in the neutral form. At the pH of the environmental samples used in our \n\nstudy (higher than 7), more than 96.2 % of SMX is in the negative form.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14- Speciation diagrams of SMX (adapted from Dias et al., (2014)). \n\n \n\nUV-Vis spectrophotometry \n\nTo evaluate the influence of the speciation of SMX on photodegradation, since it \n\ndepends on the light absorption, UV-Vis absorbance spectra of SMX at 10 mg/L in ultrapure \n\nwater without pH adjustment (pH 6.30) and with pH adjusted to different values with NaOH \n\n0.1 M or HCl 0.5 M (pH 4.97, 7.33 and 8.08) were obtained (figure 15).  \n\nFigure 13- Variation of the chemical structure of SMX with pH. \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15- UV-Vis spectra of SMX [10 mg/L] in ultrapure water at different pH values. \n\n \n\nThese pH values were chosen, because the pH value of the HS tested previously was \n\napproximately 5, the pH 6.30 is the considered pH of ultrapure water and the pH 7.33 and \n\n8.08 correspond to pH values measured for estuarine water and waste water samples, \n\nrespectively. In all spectra presented in figure 15, a decrease in UV absorbance is observed \n\nespecially above 270 nm. Comparing all the spectra, one can observe that the absorbance \n\nvalues shift to higher wavelenghts at pH 4.97. For the other pH values analysed (6.30, 7.33 \n\nand 8.08) there are also differences, but they are not so remarkable. \n\nHowever, if we compare absorbance at 290 nm (the lower wavelength used in the \n\nphotodegradation experiments) for ultrapure water at the different pH values studied we can \n\nevaluate the possible influence of pH on SMX photodegradation in ultrapure water. The \n\nresults showed the increase of absorbance values in the order: \n\n \n\n              ?? 8.08 (0.105) &lt;?? 7.33 (0.118) &lt; ?? 6.30 (0.148) &lt;?? 4.97 (0.206) \n\n \n\nTherefore, it could be expected that the rate of photodegradation of SMX increase in the \n\nsame order. If we compare the absorbance at pH 6.30 and 7.33 it is possible to observe a \n\ndecrease of 20 %, while between pH 6.30 and pH 8.0 there is a decrease of 30 %. This \n\ndecrease can explain, at least partially, the lower photodegradation rate of SMX observed \n\nfor the environmental water samples tested previously, when compared with the obtained \n\nin ultrapure water. \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nAlso, comparing the absorbance at pH 6.30 and pH 4.97 it is possible to observe an \n\nincrease of 40 %. HS tested are acidic compounds, so the influence of HS on SMX \n\nphotodegradation rate mentioned previously may be influenced not only by the presence of \n\nthe HS, but also by the pH decrease. To correctly evalute the influence of HS in the SMX \n\nphotodegradation rate, solutions containing 100 \u00b5g/L of SMX in the absence and presence \n\nof HA, FA, XAD-4 (20 mg/L), together with phosphate buffer (0.001 M) at pH 5.00 and 7.30 \n\nwere irradiated for 1 hour. The results obtained are presented in figure 16, where the \n\nphotodegradation rate (in percentage) is presented for each irradiated solution.   \n\n \n\nFigure 16- SMX photodegradation rate (%) in presence and absence of different HS fractions together with \n\nphosphate buffer (0.001 M) at pH 5.00 and 7.30 after 1 hour of irradiation. Shown error bars are standard \n\ndeviations (n=3). \n\n \n\n After analysing the results, it is possible to conclude that the photodegradation rate of \n\nSMX after 1 hour of irradiation in ultrapure water is much higher than the one obtained in \n\nall HS fractions for both pH values tested. Thus, the inner filter effect of HS is higher than \n\ntheir photosensitizing capacity, since the HS fractions absorb the radiation and, therefore, \n\nless radiation will be available for SMX photodegradation. \n\nHowever, there is a similarity of the data obtained for the kinetics of SMX \n\nphotodegradation (shown previously) in the presence of HS, for both pH. XAD-4 fraction \n\nwas the most efficient in the photodegradation of SMX, whereas the least efficient was the \n\nHA. This can be explained by HA higher UV-Vis absorbance observed in figure 11, relatively \n\nto XAD-4 fraction. \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nAF AH XAD-4 Ultrapure water\n\nP\nh\n\no\nto\n\nd\ne\n\ng\nra\n\nd\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n r\n\na\nte\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\npH=5.00\n\npH=7.30\n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nAlso, it is possible to verify that photodegradation of SMX is more efficient at pH 5.00 \n\nthan pH 7.30 either in the absence or presence of the different HS fractions studied.  \n\n \n\n3.2.4.2.

For example, after 1 hour of irradiation, the photodegradation of SMX in \n\nultrapure water at pH 7.30 was 34.71 %. However, after the same time of irradiation, \n\nphotodegradation rate in ultrapure water at pH 6.30 and pH 5.00 was 58.07 % and 78.42 %, \n\nrespectively. These results showed that ultrapure water at pH 5.00 is more efficient to \n\ninduce the photodegradation of SMX than ultrapure water at pH 6.30 and 7.30, which \n\nresulted in a SMX t1/2 of (0.49 \u00b1 0.04) h for pH 5.00 compared to (0.86 \u00b1 0.04) h and \n\n(2.9 \u00b1 0.2) h obtained in ultrapure water at pH 6.30 and 7.30, respectively. The SSD varied \n\nbetween 0.13 and 0.76, being the highest values obtained for higher pH values.  \n\nAnalysing the ?ave (table 12), the highest value was obtained in ultrapure water at \n\npH 5.00, while the lowest value corresponded to ultrapure water at pH 7.30, being in \n\naccordance with the expected, since the ? of a photodegradation process can be defined \n\nas the ratio between the photodegradation rate and the rate of light absorption. As can be \n\nseen in figure 15, there is a greater absorption of UV radiation in ultrapure water at pH 4.97 \n\nthan at pH 6.30 and at pH 7.33, where the lowest absorption occurs, which is in agreement \n\nwith the values obtained for the ?ave.  \n\nSo, it is possible to conclude that at pH 5.00 and 6.30 the photodegradation of SMX \n\nis more efficient than at pH 7.30, probably due to the fact that at pH 5.0 almost 97 % of SMX \n\nis in neutral form and, therefore, may not be complexed with other ions present in solution \n\nand thus photodegradation may be facilitated, while at pH 7.30 more than 96.2 % of SMX \n\nis in the negative form. \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n3.2.4.2.2. In estuarine water \n\nTo study the influence of pH on SMX photodegradation in environmental water \n\nsamples, a sample from Fonte Nova was spiked with the same concentration of SMX \n\n[100 \u00b5g/L] used previously, adjusting the pH to 6.30 with HCl 0.5 M and irradiated during 8 \n\nhours. The results obtained were compared with the kinetics of SMX photodegradation in \n\nFonte Nova sample at pH 7.33. \n\nThe kinetic curves of SMX photodegradation in the estuarine water sample at the two \n\ndifferent pH values tested are presented in figure 18.  \n\nApparent first order rate constants, R2, t1/2 (h) and t1/2 (SSD) obtained for SMX \n\nphotodegradation in estuarine water at pH 6.30 and 7.33 are presented in table 13.  \n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nFonte Nova pH=7.33\n\nFonte Nova pH=6.30\n\nTime (h)\n\nC\n/C\n\n0\n\n \n\nFigure 18- Kinetics of SMX photodegradation in estuarine water at pH 6.30 and 7.33.

Once present in the estuarine water sample at pH 7.33, SMX takes 22 hours to \n\ndegrade almost completely, while in the estuarine water sample at pH 6.30 it only needs 8 \n\nhours. These results showed that environmental water sample from Fonte Nova at pH 6.30 \n\nis more efficient to induce the photodegradation of SMX than Fonte Nova at pH 7.33, which \n\nresulted in a SMX t1/2 of about (2.8 \u00b1 0.2) h compared to (5.3 \u00b1 0.5) h obtained in Fonte \n\nNova at pH 7.33. The SSD varied between about 0.74 and 1.4, evidencing once again the \n\nenormous influence of pH on photodegradation of SMX. For estuarine water sample at pH \n\n6.30 a first order rate constant of (0.24 \u00b1 0.02) h-1 was obtained, being greater than that \n\nobtained for estuarine water at pH 7.33.  \n\n So, the great influence of pH either in ultrapure water or in the estuarine sample was \n\nproved. However, in environmental water samples there are other factors that can influence \n\nthe photodegradation of SMX, because in estuarine water samples the first order rate \n\nconstant is smaller than the one obtained in ultrapure water at the same pH. Thus, it is \n\nimportant to continue assessing other contributors to the decrease in the photodegradation \n\nrate. \n\n \n\n3.2.5. Effect of sea salts on SMX photodegradation \n\n3.2.5.1. Evaluation of inorganic salts on SMX photodegradation \n\nSea salts have been reported for influencing the photodegradation of some \n\ncompounds in water samples, for example, OTC due to the occurrence of complexation \n\n(Leal et al., 2016). Since the estuarine sample presents high salinity levels it is important to \n\nevaluate the influence of sea salts on SMX photodegradation behaviour. As mentioned \n\nbefore, photodegradation in sea water samples, can be influenced by the presence of \n\ninorganic compounds, such as calcium and magnesium. In fact, these are two of the main \n\nconstituents of sea water. Thus, the influence of calcium and magnesium on \n\nphotodegradation of SMX was evaluated preparing two solutions, one with 261 mg/L of \n\ncalcium and the other with 785 mg/L of magnesium. To both solutions 100 \u00b5g/L of SMX and \n\nphosphate buffer (0.001 M) were added and pH was adjusted to 7.30. These solutions were \n\nirradiated for 5 hours. Results of SMX photodegradation in those two solutions after 5 hours \n\nof irradiation were compared with those obtained in ultrapure water, in 21 \u2030 of NaCl solution \n\nand in 21 \u2030 of artificial sea salts solutions buffered with phosphate buffer (0.001 M) at pH \n\n7.30 and in estuarine water at pH 7.33 (figure 19).    \n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19- SMX photodegradation rate in ultrapure water in presence and absence of calcium, magnesium, \n\nsodium chloride and red sea salts with phosphate buffer at pH 7.30 and in estuarine water at pH 7.33 after 5 \n\nhours of irradiation. Shown error bars are standard deviations (n=3). \n\n \n\nFrom the analysis of figure 19, it is possible to verify, that the addition of magnesium, \n\ncalcium and sodium chloride decreased the photodegradation rate measured after 5 hours \n\nof irradiation comparing with the obtained in ultrapure water. The presence of magnesium \n\nis the one that most decreased the photodegradation rate, from (66.4 \u00b1 0.3) % to \n\n(37.3 \u00b1 0.6) %. The effect of calcium is not so pronounced decreasing the photodegradation \n\nto (58 \u00b1 1) %. The corrected 3D fluorescence spectra for SMX 100 g/L in ultrapure water \n\n(figure 20 \u2013 (a)) exhibited a maximum at ?em?? 350 nm with ?exc ? 260 nm. However, in \n\npresence of magnesium (figure 20 \u2013 (b)), there is a decrease of the fluorescence intensity \n\nof the SMX mentioned band and a new band appears at higher wavelengths, ?em?= (440-\n\n480) nm with ?exc = (375-410) nm, indicating the possible complexation between SMX and \n\nMg2+. In presence of Ca2+ (figure 20 \u2013 (c)) it is also possible to observe the fluorescence \n\ndecrease of SMX band, although in this case no new fluorescence band is observed. The \n\ndecrease of SMX fluorescence intensity in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ can also be \n\ncorrelated with the decrease of UV-Vis absorbance at approximately 260 nm (figure 21). \n\nIn presence of 21 \u2030 NaCl, it is possible to observe a decrease in SMX \n\nphotodegradation rate to (50.5 \u00b1 0.4) %. In this case, SMX fluorescence spectra (figure 20 \n\n\u2013 (d)) also presents a decrease in the SMX band at ?em?? 350 nm with ?exc ? 260 nm, but \n\nbesides the new band observed in the presence of magnesium, there is a second band \n\nobserved at similar ?exc of SMX in water but at higher ?em = (430-480) nm.  \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nUltrapure\nwater\n\nMagnesium\n[785 mg/L]\n\nCalcium\n[261 mg/L]\n\n21 \u2030 NaCl 21 \u2030 Red \nSea Salts\n\nEstuarine\nwater\n\nP\nh\n\no\nto\n\nd\ne\n\ng\nra\n\nd\na\n\nti\no\nn\n\n r\na\n\nte\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n300 350 400 450 500\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nE\nx\nc\nit\na\nti\no\nn\n\n W\na\nv\ne\nle\n\nn\ng\n\nth\n (\n\nn\nm\n\n)\n\nEmission Wavelength (nm) \n\n0\n\n2,000E4\n\n3,000E4\n\n4,000E4\n\n6,000E4\n\n8,000E4\n\n1,500E5\n\n3,000E5\n\n4,000E5\n\n6,000E5\n\n7,000E5\n\n8,800E5\n\n1,000E6\n\n300 350 400 450 500\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nE\nx\nc\nit\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n W\n\na\nv\ne\n\nle\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nn\n\nm\n)\n\nEmission Wavelength (nm) \n\n0\n\n2,000E4\n\n3,000E4\n\n4,000E4\n\n6,000E4\n\n8,000E4\n\n1,500E5\n\n3,000E5\n\n4,000E5\n\n6,000E5\n\n7,000E5\n\n8,800E5\n\n1,000E6\n\n300 350 400 450 500\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nE\nx\nc\nit\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n W\n\na\nv\ne\n\nle\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nn\n\nm\n)\n\nEmission Wavelength (nm) \n\n0\n\n2,000E4\n\n3,000E4\n\n4,000E4\n\n6,000E4\n\n8,000E4\n\n1,500E5\n\n3,000E5\n\n4,000E5\n\n6,000E5\n\n7,000E5\n\n8,800E5\n\n1,000E6\n\n300 350 400 450 500\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nE\nx\nc\nit\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n W\n\na\nv\ne\n\nle\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nn\n\nm\n)\n\nEmission Wavelength (nm) \n\n0\n\n2,000E4\n\n3,000E4\n\n4,000E4\n\n6,000E4\n\n8,000E4\n\n1,500E5\n\n3,000E5\n\n4,000E5\n\n6,000E5\n\n7,000E5\n\n8,800E5\n\n1,000E6\n\n300 350 400 450 500\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nE\nx\nc\nit\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n W\n\na\nv\ne\n\nle\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nn\n\nm\n)\n\nEmission Wavelength (nm) \n\n0\n\n2,000E4\n\n3,000E4\n\n4,000E4\n\n6,000E4\n\n8,000E4\n\n1,500E5\n\n3,000E5\n\n4,000E5\n\n6,000E5\n\n7,000E5\n\n8,800E5\n\n1,000E6\n\nFigure 20- 3D fluorescence spectrum (contour map) of SMX 100 \u00b5g/L in ultrapure water at pH 7.30 with \n\nphosphate buffer (0.001M) in absence of salts (a) and in presence of 785 mg/L magnesium (b), 261 mg/L \n\ncalcium (c), 21 g/L sodium chloride (d) and 21 g/L Red Sea Salts (e). \n\n(a) (b) \n\n(c) (d) \n\n(e) \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nIn presence of 21 \u2030 Red Sea Salts the decrease in the photodegradation rate, \n\n(50.3 \u00b1 0.5) %, is similar to the one observed in presence of 21 \u2030 NaCl and in the estuarine \n\nenvironmental water sample, (53 \u00b1 2) %. In what concerns the 3D fluorescence spectra \n\nthere is an obvious increase of fluorescence intensity for low excitation wavelengths, (200-\n\n275) nm, and for emissions between (250-450) nm. The changes observed in the SMX 3D \n\nfluorescence spectra in presence of Red Sea Salts indicate that the salts present in this \n\nartificial sea salt sample induce changes in SMX either by complexation/interaction with \n\ninorganic compounds or by changes of ionic strength. Also, UV-Vis absorbance spectra \n\n(figure 21) presented lower absorbance for SMX in the presence of all inorganic salts tested, \n\ncompared with SMX in ultrapure water. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAlthough individually calcium and, mainly, magnesium appear to have some \n\ninfluence on the photodegradation of SMX, when in a mixture with other compounds, it does \n\nnot appear to have a considerable influence, since photodegradation of SMX after 5 hours \n\nof irradiation in 21 \u2030 of Red Sea Salts is similar to the obtained in 21 \u2030 NaCl and estuarine \n\nwater sample.  \n\n \n\nFigura 21- UV-Vis spectra of SMX 10 mg/L in ultrapure water at pH 7.30 with phosphate buffer (0.001 M) in \n\nabsence of salts and in presence of 785 mg/L magnesium, 261 mg/L calcium, 21 \u2030 sodium chloride and 21 \n\n\u2030 Red Sea Salts. \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\n3.2.5.2. Photodegradation kinetics of SMX  \n\n To further investigate the influence of sea salts on SMX photodegradation two \n\nsolutions of 100 \u00b5g/L of SMX in 21 \u2030 of NaCl solution and in 21 \u2030 of artificial sea salts \n\nsolution with phosphate buffer (0.001 M) at pH 7.30 were irradiated for 18 hours. The results \n\nwere compared with the kinetics of 100 \u00b5g/L SMX photodegradation in Fonte Nova at \n\npH 7.33 and in ultrapure water at pH 7.30 with phosphate buffer (0.001 M). As done \n\npreviously, experimental results were fitted by non-linear regression and the obtained data \n\nfor the variation of SMX concentration along irradiation time were fitted to a pseudo first-\n\norder kinetic model (figure 22). The results obtained show that salinity has a great influence \n\non SMX photodegradation kinetics, since the addition of sodium chloride and synthetic sea \n\nsalts leads to a significant decrease in the SMX photodegradation rate, when compared to \n\nthe one obtained in ultrapure water at the same pH. It is also possible to conclude that \n\nkinetics with 21 \u2030 of NaCl and 21 \u2030 of sea salts are very similar to kinetics obtained with \n\nestuarine water sample. However, in the estuarine water sample 22 hours were necessary \n\nto degrade SMX almost completely, while in the NaCl and sea salts solutions prepared only \n\n18 hours were needed. The difference observed may be attributed to screen filter due to \n\nthe presence of organic matter in the environmental estuarine water sample. \n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nUltrapure W ater pH=7.30\n\n21 \u2030  Sea Salts pH=7.30\n\n21 \u2030  NaCl pH=7.30\n\nFonte Nova pH=7.33\n\nTime (h)\n\nC\n/C\n\n0\n\n \n\nFigure 22- Kinetics of SMX photodegradation and curves of pseudo first-order decay fitted to the data by \n\nnonlinear regression when present in ultrapure water, in ultrapure water with sea salts and in a NaCl solution \n\nbuffered with phosphate buffer at pH 7.30 and in estuarine water at pH=7.33.

These results showed \n\nthat saline environmental water samples are less efficient to induce the photodegradation \n\nof SMX, which resulted in much longer SMX t1/2 when compared to ultrapure water. The t1/2 \n\nobtained in ultrapure water was (2.9 \u00b1 0.2) h, while in estuarine water, in a 21 \u2030 artificial \n\nsea salts solution and in a 21 \u2030 NaCl solution the t1/2 obtained were (5.3 \u00b1 0.5), (5.2 \u00b1 0.1) \n\nand (4.8 \u00b1 0.1) h, respectively. So, it is possible to conclude that besides the pH, salinity \n\nalso has a high influence on SMX photodegradation.  \n\nThe differences observed between SMX photodegradation kinetics in ultrapure water \n\nand in the presence of NaCl may be attributed to changes in the SMX structure influenced \n\nby the increase in the ionic strenght, which is corroborated by the change in the 3D \n\nfluorescence spectra (figure 20 \u2013 (d)) that presents a decrease in the SMX band at \n\n?em?? 350 nm with ?exc ? 260 nm, a new band at higher wavelengths, ?em?= (440-480) nm \n\nwith ?exc = (375-410) nm and a second band observed at similar ?exc of SMX in water but at \n\nhigher ?em = (430-480) nm. Also, it is known that chloride has the ability to scavenge the \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nhydroxyl radicals (Umar and Aziz, 2013) and thus, decrease the radicals concentration that \n\ninduce SMX degradation. \n\nThe conversion of the t1/2 (h) in t1/2 in environmental conditions (SSD), allows to \n\nobserve large differences in the number of necessary SSD to reach the t1/2 between \n\nultrapure water and the samples with inorganic salts. In ultrapure water (0.76 \u00b1 0.05) SSD \n\nare needed to reach t1/2, while when SMX is present in samples with high salinity the SSD \n\nvaried between about 1.27 and 1.4 SSD. This means that when SMX is present in natural \n\nenvironments with high salinity levels its degradation rate becomes much slower, increasing \n\nthe problems associated with the persistence of SMX in natural aquatic environments.  \n\nSimilar to what was done in ultrapure water at different pH values, the ? was \n\ncalculated for 21 \u2030 artificial sea salts solution (6.79 x 10-9) and 21 \u2030 NaCl solution \n\n(1.23 x 10-8) buffered at pH 7.30 and the values obtained were lower than those obtained \n\nin ultrapure water. These values are in line with the expected, since the photodegration rate \n\nin these two solutions was lower than the obtained in ultrapure water (at all the pH values \n\ntested), being the lowest value of ? observed for the 21 \u2030 Red Sea Salts solution.  \n\nAlthough the values obtained for the first order rate constant were very similar \n\nbetween samples with the same salinity, there is greater similarity between estuarine \n\nsample ((0.13 \u00b1 0.01) h-1) and the solution with 21 \u2030 Red Sea Salts ((0.133 \u00b1 0.004) h-1). \n\nThis may be due to the fact that in the sample of synthetic sea salts there are also ions, \n\nsuch as calcium and magnesium, characteristic of estuarine samples, that, as mentioned \n\nbefore, influence the SMX photodegradation rate. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Photodegradation of SMX in continuous flow mode \n\n \n\n3.3.1. Photodegradation kinetics of SMX in ultrapure water and \n\nenvironmental water samples \n\nIn the photodegradation of SMX in continuous flow mode the concentration of SMX \n\nwas used in batch mode. Thus, direct photodegradation of 100 \u00b5g/L SMX was performed \n\nin ultrapure water without pH adjusted irradiating the solution during 1 hour. Indirect \n\nphotodegradation was performed in environmental water samples: Fonte Nova, Rio Novo \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\ndo Pr\u00edncipe, Po\u00e7o da Cruz and STPF and these samples were irradiated until no SMX was \n\ndetected.  Experimental results were fitted by non-linear regression, according to the \n\nequation 7, as in batch mode.  \n\nThe kinetic curves of SMX photodegradation in ultrapure water and in the different \n\nwater samples tested are presented in figure 23. The obtained data for the variation of SMX \n\nconcentration along irradiation time were fitted to a pseudo first-order kinetic model.  \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nUltrapure W ater\n\nRio Novo Princ\u00edpe\n\nPo\u00e7o da Cruz\n\nFonte Nova\n\nSTPF\n\nTime (h)\n\nC\n/C\n\n0\n\n \n\n \nIn all samples studied, no degradation was observed in the tube covered with \n\naluminum foils (control tube), indicating that no degradation by microbiological or thermal \n\nmeans occurred. So, the decrease of SMX concentration in these solutions can be only \n\nascribed to photo-induced degradation. \n\n For example, in ultrapure water, after 45 minutes of irradiation, SMX showed a \n\nphotodegradation of 81.38 %, while in Rio Novo do Pr\u00edncipe and Fonte Nova a \n\nphotodegradation of 47.49 % and 42.81 %, respectively, was obtained.   \n\n The results presented in table 15 showed that environmental water samples are less \n\nefficient to photodegradation SMX than ultrapure water as already shown to occur. STPF \n\nsample was the one showing the lower efficiency to induce the photodegradation of SMX, \n\nwhich resulted in much longer SMX t1/2 ((1.5 \u00b1 0.1) h) when compared to ultrapure water \n\n((0.32 \u00b1 0.03) h). The conversion of the resulting t1/2 in t1/2 in environmental conditions allows \n\nFigure 23- Kinetics of SMX photodegradation in continuous flow mode and curves of pseudo first-order \n\ndecay fitted to the data by nonlinear regression when present in ultrapure water and in environmental \n\nsamples. \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nto observe differences in the number of necessary SSD to reach the t1/2 between ultrapure \n\nwater and environmental samples. In ultrapure water (0.085 \u00b1 0.007) SSD were needed to \n\nreach t1/2, while when SMX is present in natural environmental samples the SSD varied \n\nbetween (0.25 \u00b1 0.01) and (0.39 \u00b1 0.03) SSD.  \n\n \n\nTable 15- Photodegradation of SMX in flow mode - Kmeas (h-1), R2, t1/2 (h) and t1/2 (SSD) obtained in ultrapure \n\nwater and in environmental water samples and respective standard errors.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnalysing the data, and as expected, it is possible to conclude the same as in batch \n\nmode, that is, that the environmental water samples cause a great delay in the \n\nphotodegradation of the SMX, due to the factors mentioned in the chapter 3.2.  \n\nHowever, the purpose of this study was not to prove the results obtained in chapter \n\n3.2, but trying to obtain a method to photodegradate the samples in a more efficient way, \n\nsince the tube in which the radiation is incident presents a smaller tickness. This objective \n\nwas achieved, since the samples were photodegraded in a much shorter time, as can be \n\nverify in the figure 24. For example, in the case of the Fonte Nova sample, the SSD was \n\nreduced from 1.4 to 0.37. So, the main advantages of this method are related to the less \n\nirradiation time required, which leads to a lower lamp expenditure; also, the \n\nphotodegradation in continuous mode is more easily applicable to reality, that is, it can be \n\nused as a tertiary system in STPs, since there is a defined effluent entrance and exit. The \n\ndesign of efficient processes for photodegradation of organic pollutants, in terms of energy \n\nand time, are needed for a sustainable approach. This was the first assessment of the \n\npotential of the continuous flow mode to be applied in an effluent tertiary treatment of waste \n\nwater.

Thus, this bacterial growth \n\ncorresponds to that of the culture medium where the bacteria Vibrio fischeri was grown. On \n\nthe other hand, as would be expected, in sample D there was a greater inhibition of bacterial \n\ngrowth, indicating antimicrobial activity, since SMX was in its higher concentration tested.  \n\nIt is also possible to see differences in terms of antibacterial activity between samples \n\nC and B; however, the antibacterial activity of B is less to the one of sample E although all \n\nof them present similar SMX concentrations (50 mg/L). This fact may suggest that \n\ntemperature influences antibacterial activity, since sample C and E were exposed to the \n\nsame temperature during the irradiation, whereas sample B was not irradiated and present \n\na higher antibacterial activity.  \n\nAs for samples F and G, similar bacterial activity was observed, which was higher \n\nthan the presented by sample D, being these results statistically different (for \n\n\n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\np value = 0.01). From the results obtained in ultrapure water, it can be concluded that the \n\nphotodegradation of SMX leads to a loss of antibacterial activity and if the formation of \n\nphotoproducts occurs these not exhibit higher antibacterial activity than SMX.  \n\nA B C D E F G\n\n0\n\n2 5\n\n5 0\n\n7 5\n\n1 0 0\n\n1 2 5 * * *\n\n* *\n\n* *\n\n* * *\n%\n\n \no\n\nf\n \nv\n\ni\na\n\nb\nl\ne\n\n \nc\n\ne\nl\nl\ns\n\nV\ni\nb\n\nr\ni\no\n\n \nf\ni\ns\n\nc\nh\n\ne\nr\n\ni\n\n \n\nFigure 27- Percentage of viable cells Vibrio fischeri in A \u2013 Po\u00e7o da Cruz (matrix) without SMX and without \n\nirradiation; B - control without irradiation (50 mg/L of SMX); C - control covered with aluminum at t3 of \n\nirradiation (50 mg/L of SMX); D - control without irradiation (100 mg/L of SMX); E - sample at t1 (50 mg/L of \n\nSMX); F - sample at t2 (SMX concentration &lt;5 mg/L); G - sample at t3 (no SMX detected).

Although in sample A SMX was absent, the bacterial growth in Po\u00e7o da \n\nCruz matrix was lower than the obtained in the culture medium. So, the compounds present \n\nin the water matrix from Po\u00e7o da Cruz have the ability to inhibit the bacterial growth, \n\nbecause also in samples E and G the bacterial growth is greater than in sample A, indicating \n\nthat the photodegradation eliminates compounds of the own matrix. \n\n As observed previously, sample D was the one in which the inhibition of bacterial \n\ngrowth was higher, indicating the antimicrobial activity of SMX. Samples A, B, C and D were \n\nnot statistically different, although SMX concentration and irradiation times were different, \n\nwhich again indicates that the matrix had a great effect on bacterial growth, that might be \n\neven greater than SMX effect. \n\nSample E had higher bacterial activity than sample C, and although both had the \n\nsame SMX concentration, sample E was subjected to irradiation. This suggests that, in \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\naddition to the photodegradation of the compound, photodegradation of the matrix or some \n\ncompound present in the matrix can occur, resulting in a higher bacterial activity in sample \n\nE.  \n\nSample D and E were statistically different (for p value = 0.01), with a higher bacterial \n\nactivity observed for sample E, indicating that photodegradation reduced the antibacterial \n\nactivity of SMX. Sample E and F were also statistically different (for p value = 0.01), with \n\nhigher SMX activity in sample F than in sample E. This suggests that photoproducts or \n\nphotoproducts of the first photoproducts formed had higher antibacterial activity than SMX \n\nor the matrix compounds photodegradation may result in harmful compounds with \n\nantibacterial activity, which need more time of irradiation to photodegrade than SMX. \n\nHowever, in sample G the bacterial activity increased with respect to sample F (statistically \n\ndifferent for p value = 0.001), indicating that whatever was formed in sample F disappeared \n\nat the end of the irradiation time. Once again it was proved that, for this particular case \n\nstudy, photodegradation was efficient to eliminate compounds that might increase the \n\nbacterial resistance. \n\nA B C D E F G\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n*\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nv\n\nia\nb\n\nle\n c\n\ne\nll\n\ns\nV\n\nib\nri\n\no\n f\n\nis\nc\n\nh\ne\n\nri\n\n \n\nFigure 28- Percentage of viable cells Vibrio fischeri in A \u2013 Fonte Nova (matrix) without SMX and without \n\nirradiation; B - control without irradiation (50 mg/L of SMX); C - control covered with aluminum at t3 of \n\nirradiation (50 mg/L of SMX); D - control without irradiation (100 mg/L of SMX); E - sample at t1 (50 mg/L of \n\nSMX); F - sample at t2 (SMX concentration &lt;5 mg/L); G - sample at t3 (no SMX detected).

This fact is also proved, since in \n\nsamples F and G the bacterial growth is greater than in sample A, so the photodegradation \n\nalso eliminated compounds from the matrix, which inhibit the bacterial growth. \n\nAs before, in sample D was observed the higher inhibition of bacterial growth, \n\nindicating antimicrobial activity of SMX. Samples A, B, C, D and E were not statistically \n\ndifferent, although SMX concentration and irradiation times were different, which again \n\nindicated that the matrix had a greater effect on bacterial growth than SMX.

So, the \n\ncompounds present in waste water matrix had a greater effect on bacterial growth than \n\nSMX, because it greatly inhibited bacterial growth. This effect may be due to the fact that \n\nthe STPF effluent may have in its constitution other antibiotics or other compounds harmful \n\nto the bacteria Vibrio fischeri used in this study. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Conclusions \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of SMX in aquatic environments was already referred in several \n\nstudies, and being an antibiotic, its removal or reduction in the environment is extremely \n\nimportant, mainly due to the problem of bacterial resistance.  \n\nPhotodegradation can be used to improve the remediation processes of environments \n\ncontaminated by SMX and other hazardous compounds from STPs in order to discharge \n\neffluents in the aquatic environment without its contamination.  \n\nTherefore, in this work, initially it was evaluated the SMX photodegradation in \n\nultrapure water, using simulated solar radiation, in the presence of different HS fractions \n\nand in environmental water samples from different origins. From the results obtained, it was \n\npossible to conclude that SMX photodegradation in environmental water samples was much \n\nslower than in ultrapure water. In order to understand the reason for that photodegradation \n\ndecrease several factors were evaluated, such as pH, salinity, as well as the presence of \n\ncalcium, magnesium and ionic strength in the photodegradation rate of SMX.   \n\nThis work brings together a set of results that allowed conclusions to be drawn:  \n\n\u2022 Direct photodegradation rate of SMX is pH dependent. The pH 5.00 is the most efficient \n\namong those tested, presenting a t1/2 of (0.13 \u00b1 0.01) SSD, while at pH 6.30 and 7.30 \n\nshow a t1/2 of (0.23 \u00b1 0.01) and (0.76 \u00b1 0.05) SSD, respectively. The quantum yield of \n\nSMX in ultrapure water at pH 5.00 (1.72 x 10-7) was greater than the obtained in \n\nultrapure water at pH 6.30 (2.76 x 10- 8) and at pH 7.30 (2.42 x 10-8).  \n\n\u2022 The results obtained for HS fractions were affected by a variation of pH, because the \n\nnatural pH of ultrapure water was higher than when HS were present. However, \n\ncontrolling the pH, it was possible to conclude that the presence of all HS was \n\nconsistent with a decrease on the photodegradation rate of SMX either at pH 5.00 and \n\n7.30 when compared with ultrapure water at the same pH. Thus, the inner filter effect \n\nwas higher than the photosensitizing effect of HS, being more remarkable in the \n\npresence of HA.  \n\n\u2022 In the collected water samples, under the same conditions of irradiation, the \n\nphotodegradation had a marked decrease when compared with SMX in ultrapure water \n\n(t1/2 of 0.23 \u00b1 0.01 SSD); the major decrease was observed in the STPF sample \n\n(t1/2 of 1.98 \u00b1 0.07 SSD). The Fonte Nova, Rio Novo do Pr\u00edncipe and Po\u00e7o da Cruz \n\nsamples showed a t1/2 of (1.4 \u00b1 0.1), (1.56 \u00b1 0.09) and (1.50 \u00b1 0.05) SSD, respectively. \n\nSo, this work allowed to conclude that photodegradation might not prevent the \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nenvironmental accumulation of SMX, which was shown to be considerably resistant to \n\nphotodegradation.  \n\n\u2022 The pH effect was studied in the estuarine water sample by comparing the pH value of \n\nthis sample with the natural pH of ultrapure water. The t1/2 in estuarine water at pH 6.30 \n\n(0.74 \u00b1 0.05 SSD) was much lower than t1/2 in estuarine water at pH 7.33 \n\n(1.4 \u00b1 0.1 SSD). However, when comparing the value obtained for the t1/2 at pH 6.30 in \n\nthe estuarine sample with that obtained in the ultrapure water it was verified that the t1/2 \n\nis higher in the estuarine sample and this can be explained by the higher absorbance \n\nof radiation by the estuarine sample matrix than the one observed in ultrapure water, \n\nleaving less radiation available for the SMX photodegradation (inner filter effect).  \n\n\u2022 pH is not sufficient to justify the slow photodegradation rate of SMX in environmental \n\nsamples, thus, the influence of sea salts, namely calcium, magnesium and sodium \n\nchloride on photodegradation of SMX was also evaluated. It was possible to conclude \n\nthat obtained results with the addition of 21 \u2030 of NaCl (0.143 \u00b1 0.004 h-1) or 21 \u2030 of \n\nsea salts (0.133 \u00b1 0.004 h-1) in ultrapure water at pH 7.30 were similar to the obtained \n\nin estuarine water sample at pH 7.33 (0.13 \u00b1 0.01 h-1). However, there is a greater \n\nsimilarity between estuarine sample ((0.13 \u00b1 0.01) h-1) and the solution with 21 \u2030 Red \n\nSea Salts ((0.133 \u00b1 0.004) h-1) and this may be due to the fact that in the sample of \n\nsynthetic sea salts there are also ions, such as calcium and magnesium, characteristic \n\nof estuarine samples. \n\nConcluding, it was proven that pH is extremely important on the photodegradation \n\nbehaviour of SMX in all environmental samples tested, since they all have a pH higher than \n\n7.0. However, for the estuarine sample, salinity also has an important influence, while for \n\nthe fresh water samples DOC is a contributing factor for the decrease of the degradation \n\nrate of SMX due to its inner filter effect. For the STPF sample, photodegradation of SMX is \n\ninfluenced by all the three factors mentioned: pH, salinity and DOC.  \n\nThen, the SMX photodegradation in continuous flow mode was performed in ultrapure \n\nwater and environmental samples. The photodegradation in this mode is much faster than \n\nthe observed in batch mode, since the tube in which the radiation is incident presents a \n\nsmaller thickness. Therefore, the radiation interacts easier with SMX in the sample and \n\nconsequently, increases the photodegradation rate. In this way, this method of \n\nphotodegradation becomes advantageous because it requires a lower exposure time to the \n\nradiation, and thus, a lower cost is associated to the lamp use. Also, the photodegradation \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n\n \n\nin continuous flow mode is a more efficient design for application to reality, and can be used \n\nas a sustainable approach for tertiary system in STPs.  \n\nFinally, bacterial resistance to SMX during and after photodegradation experiments \n\nwas also evaluated either in ultrapure water or in the environmental water samples. It was \n\nconcluded that photodegradation is an efficient method to combat the problem of bacterial \n\nresistance in water samples from different origins, since SMX was not detected by HPLC-\n\nFLD and the bacterial activity increased with SMX total photodegradation. Thus, the \n\nantibacterial effect of SMX is eliminated along with its photodegradation. However, with \n\nregard to the STPF sample tested, the same conclusions could not be obtained, since the \n\nSTPF sample greatly inhibits bacterial growth and, therefore, it was not possible to obtain \n\nconclusions about the influence of SMX photodegradation on bacterial activity of the \n\nbacteria Vibrio fischeri.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. Future Work \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\nIn order to complement the SMX photodegradation studies, the influence of synthetic \n\nphotosensitizers should be tested, since the photodegradation of SMX in presence of \n\nnatural photosensitizers and in environmental water samples is slower than in ultrapure \n\nwater. Therefore, it is important to achieve a way to increase the photodegradation of SMX \n\nin environmental water samples in order to decrease the persistence of SMX in natural \n\naquatic environment.  \n\nSince it is known that the formation of photodegradation products (that might be as or \n\nmore toxic than the parent compound) may occur, the assessment of the SMX \n\nphotoproducts formed, in ultrapure water and especially in environmental water samples by \n\nmass spectrometry, is essential. This study becomes even more important, since there are \n\nonly few studies in literature related to the formation of SMX photoproducts in environmental \n\nwater samples.  \n\nBesides the knowledge of the products formed and although the antibacterial activity \n\nof the products formed has been already evaluated in ultrapure and in environmental water \n\nsamples, it is also important to do acute and chronic toxicity tests in these samples. Even \n\nthough these studies are important for a correct assessment of the efficiency of the \n\nphotodegradation process, the information in literature about the toxicity of SMX \n\nphotodegradation products is scarce. Thus, it is crutial to increase the scientific community \n\nknowledge not only about the SMX photoproducts formed but also about their toxicity.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.
