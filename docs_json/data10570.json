These simulations help us to \nunderstand the surrounding environment; its spatial variability and temporal \nevolution. \nIn the present work, hydrogeochemical numerical models are developed in the \ncontext of the deep geological repository for high level nuclear waste (HLNW). \nPerformance assessment of a deep geological repository includes the study of \nits geochemical evolution, as well as the analysis of failure scenarios of the \nrepository and their environmental consequences. \nIf a repository release takes place, radionuclides from the HLNW could migrate \nthrough the surrounding engineered and natural barriers and eventually reach \nthe surface ecosystems. In this case, near-surface sediments constitute the last \nnatural barrier between the repository and the surface ecosystems. \nIn this study biogeochemical, geochemical, hydrodynamic and solute transport \nprocesses are coupled in different numerical models to understand and \nquantify the influence of these processes on radionuclide mobility in near-\nsurface systems. \nThe results attained here prove the robustness of such numerical tools to \ndevelop both descriptive and predictive simulations of hydrogeochemical \nprocesses that affect radionuclide mobility. \nThe (descriptive) simulation of a jar-fermentor experiment reveals that microbial \nactivity tends to decrease the redox state of groundwater which favours the \nretention of redox sensitive radionuclides such as uranium. \nPredictive simulations reveal that co-precipitation with major element phases, \nprecipitation of pure phases, cation exchange and adsorption on charged \nmineral surfaces provide the retention of uranium, caesium, strontium and \nradium in the solid phase of a glacial clay and a calcite-rich till deposit. \nLabelling of radionuclides in the numerical simulations shows that isotopic \ndilution also plays an important role in the potential impact of radionuclides in \nthe near-surface systems. \nFinally, effective distribution coefficients can be calculated from the outputs of \nprevious reactive solute transport simulations. This methodology provides the \nsimulation of synthetic tracer tests with long time spans that would not be \nfeasible at the human life scale. The outputs of these synthetic tracer tests \nprovide the estimation of effective retardation factors that may be useful for \nperformance assessment of deep geological repositories. \n\n \n\n \nvi \n\n\n\nvii \n\nIndex \n\n \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n \n\n1.1 Motivation \n\nHydrogeochemical numerical modelling is worldwide used to simulate natural and \n\nanthropogenically induced phenomena. These simulations help us to understand the \n\nsurrounding environment; its spatial variability and temporal evolution. Dealing with \n\nevolving systems requires understanding the past which, in turn, sustains predictions \n\nabout the future. \n\nDuring the last decades, management and disposal of high level nuclear waste (HLNW) \n\nhave been motivating an increasing number of scientific research projects where \n\nhydrogeochemical numerical modelling plays an important role. The present work is in \n\nclose relation to two national programmes dedicated to the final disposal of HLNW: the \n\nnational programme hosted by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) and the national \n\nprogramme hosted by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company \n\n(SKB). Both programmes consider the deep geological repository as the solution for the \n\nfinal disposal of HLNW. \n\nAccording to international agreements, the nuclear waste must not burden future \n\ngenerations. HLNW has to be managed responsibly to ensure public safety, protection of \n\nthe environment, and security from malicious intervention now and in the future (OECD, \n\n1999). Since HLNW is partially composed of long-lived radionuclides its final disposal \n\nmust guarantee safety and isolation for at least 100,000 years after repository closure \n\n(SKB, 2006). The deep geological repository is the most widely accepted solution among \n\ncountries with nuclear power plants (Brookins, 1987; C\u00e9cille, 1991).  \n\nAccording to the Swedish (and also Finish) concept, a deep geological repository consists \n\nof deposition holes excavated at a depth of approximately 500 m where HLNW is stored. \n\nThe packages of HLNW are surrounded by several engineered barriers which may vary \n\nfrom country to country. Some of these engineered barriers include metal canisters, clay \n\nbarriers and cement liners. The host rock and the overlying surface sediments represent \n\nthe natural barriers of a deep geological repository. \n\nThe chemical and physical properties of the HLNW show some differences from country \n\nto country. In Sweden, HLNW is the spent nuclear fuel that is no longer energetically \n\nefficient to keep being used in nuclear power plants. It is a ceramic material composed of \n\nuranium dioxide that is very stable under the conditions of the repository (i.e. under the pH \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n2 \n\nand redox conditions of groundwater at repository depths). On the other hand, in Japan, \n\nHLNW is a non-profitable product of the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to recover \n\nuranium and plutonium. In Japan, the HLNW is vitrified in borosilicate glass to ensure its \n\nphysico-chemical stability. \n\nWhen dealing with the final disposal of HLNW, the potential migration of radionuclides \n\nthrough the engineered and natural barriers that surround the repository must be \n\nassessed. In performance assessment of deep geological repositories, failure scenarios of \n\nthe repository and their environmental consequences are being analysed (e.g. SKB, \n\n2006). In case of repository release, the surface sediments overlying the repository host \n\nrock represent the last geological barrier prior to the surface ecosystems.  \n\nIn the framework of performance assessment, the geochemical long-term evolution of a \n\ndeep geological repository is usually assessed by using hydrogeochemical numerical \n\nsimulations which couple laboratory and field data for the long time spans needed to be \n\nconsidered when dealing with HLNW. \n\nThe present work is focused on the hydrodynamic and geochemical processes that prevail \n\nin the near-surface systems overlying a potential host rock which influence radionuclide \n\nmobility (Figure 1.1). \n\n \n\n \n\nRadioactive \n\nwaste\n\nSurface\n\nNear-surface systems\n\n500 m\n\n20 m\n\nSurface \n\nwater\n\nSurface \n\nbiosphere\n\nHost \n\nrock\n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Sketch of the near-surface systems overlying a deep geological repository \n\n(modified with permission from SKB image archive; www.skb.se). \n\n \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n3 \n\n1.2 Scope \n\nThis thesis is composed of four main chapters presenting different examples of \n\nhydrogeochemical simulations developed to assess radionuclide mobility in near-surface \n\nsystems that overly a potential host rock for a deep geological repository. The numerical \n\nmodels developed are focused on a laboratory-scale problem (Chapter 2) and two-\n\ndimensional field-scale problems (Chapters 3 to 5). Besides the four main chapters, two \n\nother chapters provide the introduction to (Chapter 1) and the general conclusions of \n\n(Chapter 6) the whole research work. \n\nIn Chapter 1, the motivation, scope, methodology, state-of-the-art and main objectives of \n\nthe research work are presented. In Chapter 2 an aquatic system with no transport of \n\nsolutes is simulated. The concentration of solutes is considered to vary over time due to \n\ngeochemical and biochemical reactions. In Chapters 3 to 5, two-dimensional groundwater \n\nsystems where water flows and transports solutes that may react with the solid matrix of \n\nthe porous media are developed. \n\nConcerning the master variables time and space, two main types of hydrogeochemical \n\nproblems may be found: \n\n\u2022 Hydrogeochemical problems where water flow and solute transport are negligible; \n\ni.e. the concentration of chemical species does not vary in space. In this type of \n\nproblems, the concentration of solutes varies over time due to heterogeneous and \n\nhomogeneous chemical reactions (heterogeneous meaning those reactions that \n\ntake place between aqueous, solid, and gaseous phases, while homogeneous \n\nreactions take place within a single phase; e.g. aqueous complexation). In \n\naddition, these chemical reactions can occur under local thermodynamic \n\nequilibrium or under kinetics. Chapter 2 presents the development of a numerical \n\nmodel of this type of problem. \n\n\u2022 Reactive transport problems where the concentration of solutes varies over time \n\nand space due to groundwater flow which transports dissolved species that may \n\nreact with solid (minerals, organic matter, etc.) and gaseous components (e.g. \n\nO2(g)). Chapters 3 to 5 present examples for the development of numerical models \n\nof this type of problem. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 1.2, the main (bio)geochemical reactions that are believed to occur in an aquatic \n\nsystem such as the jar-fermentor experiment that was studied in Chapter 2 are illustrated. \n\nIn the aqueous phase, solutes may be complexed with other species, or undergo redox \n\nand acid-base reactions. When organic matter is available, microbial respiration is able to \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n4 \n\ntrigger redox reactions involving inorganic (O2, NO3\n-\n, Fe\n\n3+\n, SO4\n\n2-\n) and organic solutes \n\n(dissolved organic matter such as lactate, propionate and acetate). In addition, elements \n\nlike carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen can be removed from solution and \n\nincorporated into biomass cells (biomass growth), or they can be released into solution \n\ndue to biomass decay. Finally, solutes may be transferred to other phases (gas and solid) \n\ndue to the different heterogeneous geochemical reactions that are shown in Figure 1.2. \n\n \n\nexsolution\n\nprecipitation\n\nco-precipitation\n\nsorption\n\ndissolution\n\ndesorption\n\ndissolution\n\naqueous complexation\n\nacid-base reactions\n\nbiomass\n\ndecay\n\nbiomass\n\ngrowth\n\nGas\n\nAqueous\n\nSolid\n\nmicrobial \n\nrespiration\n\nredox reactions\n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Sketch of a hydro-bio-geochemical system where the main heterogeneous and \n\nhomogeneous reactions are illustrated. The yellow arrows illustrate the possible fluxes of \n\nchemical species between the different phases: gas, aqueous, solid, and biomass (green \n\nsymbol). \n\n \n\nIn a hydrogeochemical problem, such as the one developed in Chapter 2, two main \n\nequations must be solved to describe the changes in the concentration of chemical \n\nspecies due to local thermodynamic equilibrium reactions (equation 1.1) and kinetic \n\nreactions (equation 1.2). The general equation describing local thermodynamic equilibrium \n\nreactions is (e.g. Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999): \n\n \n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\ntsreac\n\nr\n\nproducts\n\np\n\nr\n\np\n\na\n\na\n\nK\n\ntan\n\n?\n\n?\n\n                                                                                            (equation 1.1) \n\n \n\nwhere K is the equilibrium constant, a is the activity, ?r and ?p are the stoichiometric \n\ncoefficients of the reactants and products of a given chemical reaction, respectively. \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n5 \n\nActivities of the aqueous species are related to molalities through activity coefficients \n\nwhich may be calculated using different expressions, such as the Debye-H\u00fcckel equation. \n\nIn equation 1.1 there is no integration in time for the concentration of a species, since \n\nlocal equilibrium reactions do not depend on the master variable time. Therefore, for the \n\nconcentration of a given chemical species to vary in time, under local equilibrium, some \n\nexternal source/sink term must occur to induce the change in concentration. This external \n\nsource/sink term can be the addition of a new substance (mineral, gas or a different \n\nsolution) which is not in equilibrium with the original solution or the presence of mineral \n\nphases of which dissolution/precipitation is kinetically driven. \n\nBesides local thermodynamic equilibrium, the kinetic chemical reactions can be described \n\nby the following general equation (e.g. Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999): \n\n \n\nkki\ni R\n\ndt\n\ndm\n,\n\n??                                                                                               (equation 1.2) \n\n \n\n where mi is the molality of species i, t is time, ?I,k is the stoichiometric coefficient of \n\nspecies i in the kinetic reaction for substance k, and Rk is the overall reaction rate for \n\nsubstance k. \n\nThe reactive transport models developed in Chapters 3 to 5 rely on the continuum \n\nhypothesis, where a real groundwater system is approximated by using partial differential \n\nequations that describe the variations of mass (of water and chemical species) over time \n\nand space. In the continuum representation of the porous medium, the physico-chemical \n\nvariables describing the system, such as porosity, hydraulic conductivity, mineral \n\nconcentration, etc., are averaged over a representative elemental volume (REV; Bear, \n\n1972, Figure 1.3). In the REV, each variable assumes a single value for each time step. \n\nIf we consider the mass balance for groundwater flow in a saturated porous medium, the \n\nnet flux J shown in Figure 1.3 represents Darcy\u2019s velocity, and the corresponding mass \n\nbalance for a three-dimensional groundwater flow can be expressed by the following \n\nequation: \n\n \n\nt\n\nh\nS\n\nz\n\nh\nk\n\nzy\n\nh\nk\n\nyx\n\nh\nk\n\nx\nszyx\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n                                         (equation 1.3) \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n6 \n\nwhere x, y and z are the Cartesian coordinates describing space, k is the hydraulic \n\nconductivity in units of [LT\n-1\n] which can be anisotropic, meaning that it assumes different \n\nvalues depending on the direction in space, h is the hydraulic head [L], Ss is the specific \n\nstorage coefficient (dimensionless), and t is time. \n\n \n\nX\n\nZ\n\nY\n\nX\n\nZ\n\nY\n\nx\nJ xxJ ??\n\nz\nJ\n\nzz\nJ\n\n??\n\nyy\nJ\n\n??\n\ny\nJ\n\nS?\n\nS? - Storage change;J - Net flux;\n\nLegend:\n\nS? - Storage change;S? - Storage change;J - Net flux;J - Net flux;\n\nLegend:\n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Representative elemental volume (REV) showing the mass fluxes that cross its \n\nboundaries. The conservation of mass within the REV is described by the following \n\nequation: (Jx + Jy + Jz) \u2013 (Jx+?x + Jy+?y + Jz+?z) = ?S. \n\n \n\nIf we consider the mass balance for a conservative solute in a hydrodynamic system, \n\nthen, the net flux J in Figure 1.3 represents the sum of the advective, dispersive and \n\ndiffusive fluxes. In addition, if we consider the mass balance for a reactive solute, we must \n\nadd a source/ sink term that represents the addition or removal of the reactive solute to or \n\nfrom solution, due to chemical reactions between this solute and the solid matrix of the \n\nporous medium. \n\nThe overall equation describing the mass balance for a reactive solute in a saturated \n\nporous medium is: \n\n \n\n\n\nI.

If w is null, then the corresponding \n\nsolute is considered a conservative solute, which does not react with the solid matrix of \n\nthe porous medium. \n\nIf the source/ sink term w is calculated using equations 1.1 and 1.2, that describe \n\nequilibrium and kinetic chemical reactions, the numerical model is considered a reactive \n\ntransport model. On the other hand, if the source/ sink term w is calculated by using a \n\ndistribution coefficient (Kd) which defines the ratio between the concentration of a solute \n\nin solid and aqueous phases, then the model is considered a Kd-based model. \n\nThe numerical models developed in Chapters 3 and 4 are reactive solute transport models \n\nwhere water flow and transport of dissolved species are coupled with geochemical \n\nreactions between solid and aqueous phases. In Chapter 3, a diffusion dominated porous \n\nmedia that represents a glacial clay sediment is modelled, while in Chapter 4 an advection \n\ndominated porous media, represented by a till deposit that hosts unconfined aquifers, is \n\ndeveloped. \n\nChapter 5 presents a methodology for estimating effective Kd\u2019s from the outputs of the \n\nreactive transport numerical simulations developed in Chapter 4. The meaning and \n\napplicability of these Kd values estimated from reactive solute transport simulations are \n\ndiscussed and validated in Chapter 5. \n\nThe work presented in Chapter 2 has been developed in the framework of JAEA \n\nprogramme for the management of HLNW, and has been presented as a poster at the \n\n19\nth\n V.M. Goldschmidt\u2122 conference. \n\nThe work presented in Chapters 3 to 5 has been developed in the framework of SKB Site \n\nCharacterization Programme for Sweden\u2019s deep geological repository. This work resulted \n\nin two technical reports published by SKB which are available for download at \n\nwww.skb.se. The two publications are: Grandia et al. (2007) and Sena et al. (2008). \n\nChapter 6 summarizes the work presented in the preceding chapters, integrates the main \n\nconclusions attained in each chapter, and presents the final discussions related to some \n\nunsolved problems and future works. \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n8 \n\n1.3 Methodology \n\nThe development of any numerical model relies on the definition of a sound conceptual \n\nmodel which couples the data available for the system under study with information on \n\nother similar systems, as well as information gathered from laboratory experiments. The \n\nconceptual model identifies the features, events and processes that describe the system \n\nunder study, and also the limits of the system. The conservation of mass and energy \n\nmust, therefore, be fulfilled within the limits of the conceptual model. The conceptual \n\nmodel reflects the information gathered to describe the system under study and also the \n\ninterpretations and assumptions which, in turn, are based on the observations and \n\nmeasurements of the system and on the information obtained on other similar systems. \n\nAfter building a sound and reliable conceptual model, the numerical model is built based \n\non the data, interpretations and assumptions that describe the conceptual model, but with \n\nthe limitations associated to the capabilities of the codes and of process understanding \n\nand parameterization. Calibration of the numerical model represents the step where the \n\nconceptual model is validated and questioned. This procedure has been adopted in all the \n\nnumerical models developed in the present work. \n\nIn Chapter 2 a numerical model that simulates microbially mediated redox processes in \n\nlake sediments is developed using PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). This \n\nnumerical model simulates a jar-fermentor experiment that was conducted by JAEA to \n\nassess the role of microbial activity in aquatic subsurface systems. During this experiment \n\nlake water and sediment samples were mixed and oxidized by atmosphere bubbling \n\nduring 5 days. Then, an organic electron donor substance (lactate) was added to the jar-\n\nfermentor which was kept in closed conditions for additional 13 days. During the \n\nexperiment the main geochemical parameters and bacterial flora were analyzed \n\n(Nakajima et al., 2008). \n\nIn this modelling exercise, Monod kinetic equations have been implemented to simulate \n\nmicrobially mediated reactions. In addition, abiotic, kinetic and equilibrium, geochemical \n\nreactions have also been considered. The numerical model developed is intended to \n\nsimulate the observed consumption of organic electron donors (lactate, acetate and \n\npropionate) and inorganic electron acceptors (O2, NO3\n-\n, Fe\n\n3+\n and SO4\n\n2-\n), as well as their \n\neffect on the master variables pH and Eh. \n\nFrom all the biogeochemical parameters that were implemented in the numerical model \n\ndeveloped in Chapter 2, the Monod kinetic parameters are subject to a relatively high \n\ndegree of uncertainty. Therefore, the calibration of the numerical model developed in \n\nChapter 2 relies on that combination of the Monod kinetic parameters which leads to the \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n9 \n\nbest agreement between measured and simulated values of the different organic and \n\ninorganic geochemical variables. \n\nSimulation of microbially mediated kinetic reactions follows the so called partial \n\nequilibrium approach in which the oxidation of organic matter is considered to be the rate \n\nlimiting process, and the geochemical system is led to respond under local equilibrium by \n\nreducing the most thermodynamically favourable electron acceptor (EA). In addition, \n\ninhibition terms have been used to describe mathematically the sequential use of EA\u2019s \n\n(Barry et al., 2002, and references therein). \n\nChapters 3 and 4 encompass a modelling procedure using PHREEQC (Parkhurst and \n\nAppelo, 1999) and PHAST (Parkhurst et al., 2004) to predict radionuclide retention in two \n\ndistinct near-surface sediments present at Forsmark (Sweden). Forsmark is the candidate \n\nsite that has been selected in June 2009 for the location of a deep geological repository in \n\nSweden. In order to assess radionuclide retention in the near-surface systems at \n\nForsmark four radionuclides (\n235\n\nU, \n135\n\nCs, \n226\n\nRa and \n90\n\nSr) have been selected according to \n\ntheir different geochemical behaviour and potential dose relevance to surface \n\necosystems. \n\nThe sediment modelled in Chapter 3 is a glacial clay located between surface water \n\nbodies and the shallow unconfined aquifers hosted by till deposits, while in Chapter 4 the \n\ncalcite-rich Quaternary till that overlies the granite candidate host rock is modelled. \n\nPrediction of radionuclide retention in both Quaternary sediments relies on a hypothetical \n\nscenario of repository release where deep groundwater flowing through a fracture in the \n\ngranite candidate host rock is considered to transport dissolved radionuclides from the \n\nrepository to the near-surface systems (Figure 1.4). \n\nThe main steps of the modelling procedure applied in Chapters 3 and 4 include: \n\n1) the detailed analysis of SKB\u2019s hydrogeochemical database for the near-surface \n\nsystems at Forsmark; \n\n2) the development of the conceptual model of each modelled system based on data \n\ngathered in the first step and on the comparison of the systems under study with \n\nsimilar systems; \n\n3) the thorough review of the thermodynamic parameters required for the simulation \n\nof geochemical processes; \n\n4) the implementation of the conceptual model in reactive transport numerical \n\nsimulations; \n\n5) the simulation of the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions observed at \n\nForsmark, by developing a long-term reactive transport simulation; \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n10 \n\n6) the simulation of a hypothetical repository release in the numerical model; and, \n\n7) the quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the modelled systems \n\nbased on the outputs of the numerical simulations. \n\n \n\n500 m\n\nHLNW repository\n\nSurface water\n\nWetland Till\n\nPost-glacial clay\n\nGlacial clay\n\nBedrock\n\nFracture\n\nFracture zone\n\nLegend:\n\nHypothetical path of a repository-derived radionuclide\n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Sketch of a deep geological repository for HLNW in a granitic host rock \n\nshowing a hypothetical path for radionuclides potentially released from the repository. The \n\nnear-surface systems that have been modelled in Chapters 3 and 4 (glacial clay and till) are \n\nhighlighted with a red rectangle.  \n\n \n\nAfter analysing SKB\u2019s hydrogeochemical database for the Forsmark site, (1) the glacial-\n\nclay porewater; (2) the shallow groundwater of the till deposit; and, (3) the deep granitic \n\ngroundwater have been selected as the most representative near-surface waters for the \n\nsimulations. The selection of the reactive minerals considered in the numerical models of \n\nthe glacial clay and till sediments relies on three main premises: (1) which are the \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n11 \n\nminerals present in the system under consideration?; (2) which are the minerals that \n\ncontrol pH and Eh in each Quaternary sediment?; and, (3) which are the minerals that \n\nmay affect the mobility of the selected radionuclides? Unfortunately, in some cases the \n\ninformation on the minerals present in the system is not always available or it is \n\nincomplete. In these cases, the selection of the reactive minerals must be based on the \n\nknowledge on this type of systems coupled with the analysis of the geochemical data \n\navailable for the system under study. \n\nIn natural aquatic systems, the most common geochemical reactions that radionuclides \n\nmay undergo are: \n\n1) Cation exchange in clay minerals. Cation exchange is the replacement of a cation \n\ninitially adsorbed in the interlayer of a clay mineral by another cation present in \n\ngroundwater (Appelo and Postma, 2005; Stumm and Morgan, 1996). \n\n2) Adsorption on charged surfaces of minerals such as oxyhydroxides or clays. \n\nAdsorption is the adherence of an ion on the charged surface of a mineral. The \n\ncharge of a given mineral may vary from negatively charged to positively charged, \n\npassing through a non-charged surface which is called the point of zero charge, \n\ndepending on the pH conditions of groundwater (Dzombak and Morel, 1990; \n\nStumm and Morgan, 1996). \n\n3) Sorption onto organic tissues. As on charged mineral phases, ions can also \n\nadsorb on the charged surfaces of organic tissues (Appelo and Postma, 2005; and \n\nreferences therein). \n\n4) Co-precipitation with major element solid phases such as sulphates, sulphides, \n\noxyhydroxides and carbonates. Co-precipitation is the formation of solid solutions \n\nbetween two or more solid phases. Solid solutions are, therefore, minerals with \n\nvariable compositions of pure end-member minerals (Glynn and Reardon, 1990; \n\nand references therein). \n\n5) Aqueous complexation with organic and inorganic ligands such as humic acids \n\nand aqueous carbonates. Aqueous complexation depends greatly on the pH and \n\nredox state of groundwater. In addition, by complexing with aqueous species, the \n\nprecipitation of solid phases that incorporate radionuclides may be hindered. \n\n6) Precipitation of pure phases. In some cases, and despite the relatively low \n\nconcentrations of radionuclides, precipitation of pure phases such as amorphous \n\nuraninite can be relevant. \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n12 \n\nIn the numerical simulations developed in Chapters 3 and 4, radionuclides potentially \n\nreleased by the repository were labelled to trace and distinguish them from natural \n\noccurring isotopes in the numerical simulations (\nRD\n\nSr, \nRD\n\nCs and \nRD\n\nU, where RD stands for \n\nRepository-Derived). Radium was not labelled since it was considered to be below \n\ndetection limit in the porewater of the studied Quaternary deposits, before repository \n\nrelease. \n\nLabelling of repository-derived radionuclides involved the addition of the labelled species \n\nas primary species to the thermodynamic database used in the numerical simulations. \n\nThe secondary aqueous species for labelled radionuclides had to be added by duplicating \n\nthe reactions for non-labelled isotopes and replacing the isotope with the labelled \n\nradionuclide. In order to consider the incorporation of both repository-derived \n\nradionuclides and naturally occurring isotopes in the same solid phase, without causing an \n\nartificial isotopic fractionation, new ideal solid solutions involving both species had also to \n\nbe added to the thermodynamic database. \n\nThe numerical results attained in Chapters 3 and 4 have proven that the labelling \n\nprocedure has been done correctly, and no artificial isotopic fractionation has been \n\nintroduced. Actually, in Chapter 5, the Kd values calculated from the outputs of the \n\nnumerical simulations developed in Chapter 4 are the same for each isotope (labelled and \n\nunlabelled species) of a given element which reflects the inexistence of an unintended \n\nfractionation process. \n\nRadionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments was quantitatively assessed from the \n\noutputs of the numerical simulations developed in Chapters 3 and 4. This modelling \n\nprocedure has proven to be a robust methodology for such quantitative assessment. \n\nThe work presented in Chapters 2 to 4 entails numerical models that account for \n\nbiochemical (Chapter 2) and geochemical (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) processes influencing \n\nsolute mobility. This type of models is usually assigned to the so called \u201ccomponent \n\nadditivity\u201d (CA) approach, i.e. these models assume that each mineral in a complex \n\nmineral assemblage has unique thermodynamic properties, where the important linkage \n\nbetween solid and aqueous species is retained through the coupling of mass action \n\nequations (Davis et al. 1998, and references therein). This approach is much more \n\ncomplex and computational demanding than a constant Kd approach, but it is much more \n\nreliable when dealing with complex near-surface systems like the ones modelled here. \n\nNear-surface systems are affected by changes in key geochemical parameters (pH, Eh, \n\nionic strength) which strongly influence the Kd value. In addition, if a given mineral \n\nprecipitates or dissolves, a Kd-based model is not able to account for the increase or \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n13 \n\ndecrease of the solid pool that retains a reactive solute. Nevertheless, for the time being, \n\nKd-based models are still considered to be a very useful tool to simulate groundwater \n\nsystems with large dimensions and extremely complex flow conditions, as the fractured \n\nkilometric volumes of a candidate host rock for a deep geological repository. In addition, \n\nhydrogeochemical models depend on reliable site specific data and thermodynamic \n\nparameters which may be difficult to get or eventually have not been developed yet. \n\nA Kd-based model does not depend on thermodynamic data, and site specific data may \n\nbe more generic than for the component additivity type of models. In this context, Kd-\n\nbased models can be used for the preliminary and more general assessments of a given \n\nproblem. In this context, in Chapter 5, effective Kd values have been estimated from the \n\noutputs of the reactive transport numerical model developed in Chapter 4. The meaning \n\nand validity of these Kd values has been assessed and discussed in Chapter 5 by \n\ndeveloping Kd-based transport models using FEFLOW (Diersch, 2005). \n\n \n\n1.4 State-of-the-art \n\n1.4.1 Kd-based models versus reactive transport models \n\nWhen a modeller selects a code for solving groundwater flow coupled with reactive solute \n\ntransport two main approaches may be found. On one hand, there are codes that solve \n\ngroundwater flow coupled with a set of non-linear equations that describe the geochemical \n\nreactions between reactive solutes and the solid phase (also called the component \n\nadditivity approach, Davis et al., 1998); and, on the other hand there are models based on \n\neffective distribution coefficients (Kd) or retardation factors (R) that integrate the retention \n\nprovided by the overall geochemical reactions that affect the transport of a reactive solute \n\n(also called generalized composite approach, Davis et al., 1998). \n\nIn 1981, Reardon discussed the reliability of Kd-based models to describe reversible ion \n\nsorption reactions in contaminant migration. The author concluded that if the groundwater \n\nsystem is in a steady state chemical evolution a Kd-based model should be as reliable as \n\na reactive transport model. At chemical steady state, the sorbing sites at any point in the \n\nflow path are in equilibrium with the way in which groundwater is evolving chemically and \n\ntherefore the Kd of a given location should be constant over time. Based on these results, \n\nGlynn (2003) performed 1D geochemical transport simulations to demonstrate the effects \n\nof aqueous speciation and sorption reactions on the transport of neptunium and \n\nplutonium. The author concluded that a Kd-based model would lead to remarkably \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n14 \n\ndifferent results from those attained in the previous geochemical transport simulations, \n\npointing out the care that must be taken when choosing the type of model to be used in \n\nperformance assessment of nuclear waste-disposal sites.  \n\nOver the past decades a considerable amount of computer codes that solve groundwater \n\nflow coupled with multicomponent reactive solute transport has emerged which reflects on \n\none hand the increasing need for using these tools and on the other hand the fast \n\nincrease of computer computational capacity. Allied to the advances on computing \n\ntechniques, improved scientific understanding, experimental and site specific data, \n\ntogether with improved numerical models have provided representations of the potential \n\nbehaviour of geological disposal systems which increase confidence on performance \n\nassessment programmes (OECD, 1999). \n\nIt is not intended to provide here a thorough review of computer codes that solve \n\nhydrogeochemical problems (the reader is referred to Brun and Engesgaard, 2002, for a \n\nreview on biogeochemical modelling; MacQuarrie and Mayer, 2005, for a review on \n\nreactive transport in fractured rock; and, Gaucher and Blanc, 2006, for a review on \n\nmodelling cement/clay interactions), but since some of these codes have been extensively \n\nused in the work developed in this thesis, a brief review of some of the most important \n\ncodes is provided, some of which have been developed and/or often used in the context \n\nof deep geological repositories for HLNW: \n\n1) PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) is a well known geochemical code based \n\non an ion-association aqueous model that solves speciation and saturation-index \n\ncalculations; batch-reaction and one-dimensional (1D) transport calculations \n\ninvolving a wide variety of reversible equilibrium and kinetic geochemical \n\nreactions, as well as inverse modelling; \n\n2) PHAST (Parkhurst et al., 2004) is a finite-difference code that simulates multi-\n\ncomponent, reactive solute transport in three-dimensional (3D) saturated \n\ngroundwater flow systems. The geochemical code PHREEQC is embedded in \n\nPHAST. \n\n3) RETRASO (Saaltink et al., 1997) is a finite-element code that solves two-\n\ndimensional (2D) reactive solute transport in saturated media. \n\n4) CORE\n2D\n\n (Samper et al., 2000) is a finite element code for solving 2D groundwater \n\nflow, heat transfer and multicomponent reactive solute transport in partially or fully \n\nsaturated media. \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n15 \n\n5) TOUGHREACT (Xu et al., 2008) is a finite-element code that solves 3D non-\n\nisothermal multi-component reactive solute transport, multi-phase fluid and heat \n\nflow.  \n\n6) CrunchFlow (Steefel, 2008) is a finite volume code currently restricted to \n\northogonal grids. \n\n \n\nThe work presented in this thesis provides examples of hydrogeochemical models that \n\nhave been developed using PHREEQC and PHAST to solve different problems \n\nconcerning the processes affecting the mobility of radionuclides in the near-surface \n\nsystems that overly potential host rocks for a deep geological repository. \n\nFeflow (Diersch, 2005) was used in Chapter 5 to test the meaning of the Kd values \n\nestimated from the outputs of the reactive transport model developed in Chapter 4. Feflow \n\nis a finite difference code that simulates groundwater flow under non-isothermal and \n\nvariably saturated conditions, and transport of conservative and reactive solutes. \n\nTransport of reactive solutes is simulated by using the Kd approach (Diersch, 2005). \n\nPHREEQC version 2 is a numerical code that simulates a wide variety of low-temperature \n\naqueous geochemical calculations. It is based on an ion-association aqueous model and \n\nhas capabilities for (1) speciation and saturation-index calculations; (2) batch-reaction and \n\n1D transport calculations involving reversible reactions, which include aqueous, mineral, \n\ngas, solid-solution, surface-complexation, and ion-exchange equilibria, and irreversible \n\nreactions such as kinetically controlled reactions, mixing of solutions, and temperature \n\nchanges; and (3) inverse modelling, which finds sets of mineral and gas mole transfers \n\nthat account for differences in composition between waters, within specified compositional \n\nuncertainty limits. The equations solved by PHREEQC for the chemical equilibrium and \n\nkinetic reactions are non-linear algebraic equations (NLAE\u2019s) describing equilibrium \n\nchemical reactions, and ordinary differential equations (ODE\u2019s) describing rates of kinetic \n\nchemical reactions (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). \n\nPHAST is a multi-component, reactive solute transport code for up to 3D saturated \n\ngroundwater flow systems, with capabilities to model a wide range of equilibrium and \n\nkinetic geochemical reactions. The flow and transport calculations are based on a \n\nmodified version of HST3D (Kipp, 1987) that is restricted to constant fluid density and \n\nconstant temperature. The geochemical reactions are simulated with the geochemical \n\ncode PHREEQC, which is embedded in PHAST (Parkhurst et al., 2004). \n\nThe governing equations solved by PHAST are a set of (1) partial differential equations \n\n(PDE\u2019s) describing groundwater flow and solute transport for each aqueous component; \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n16 \n\n(2) NLAE\u2019s describing equilibrium chemical reactions; and, (3) ODE\u2019s describing rates of \n\nkinetic chemical reactions (Parkhurst et al., 2004). \n\nIn PHAST, an operator splitting of the (i) flow, (ii) transport, and (iii) geochemical \n\nequations is used to separate the three processes into three sequential calculations. No \n\niterations between transport and reaction calculations are implemented. A three-\n\ndimensional Cartesian coordinate system and finite-difference techniques are used for the \n\nspatial and temporal discretization of the flow and transport PDE\u2019s. The NLAE\u2019s that \n\ndescribe the local equilibrium chemical reactions are solved by a Newton-Raphson \n\nmethod, and the kinetic reaction ODE\u2019s are solved by a Runge-Kutta or an implicit method \n\nfor integrating ODE\u2019s (Parkhurst et al., 2004). \n\nA multicomponent reactive transport code, such as PHAST, solves the following \n\nequations: \n\n\u2022 Equations (1.1 and 1.2) for heterogeneous equilibrium and kinetic reactions; \n\n\u2022 Flow equation (1.3) which combines the Darcy\u2019s law and the mass balance \n\nequation; \n\n\u2022 Solute transport equation (1.4) \n\n \n\nAfter establishing the hydrodynamic and geochemical initial conditions, the sequence of \n\ncalculations performed by PHAST includes three steps (Parkhurst et al., 2004): \n\n1. The flow equation is solved for the hydraulic head values, and these are \n\nused for calculating the water velocity that is used in the solute transport \n\nequation. \n\n2. The solute transport equation is calculated for each primary aqueous \n\nspecies. \n\n3. The equations for equilibrium and kinetic reactions are solved. \n\n \n\nIn 1996, Lichtner et al. mentioned the inevitable reliance of the performance assessment \n\nof a deep geological repository on reactive transport numerical models. Without these \n\ntools quantitative assessment of the long-term performance of a deep geological \n\nrepository would be very difficult or even impossible due to the large amount of non-linear \n\nequations and long time spans needed to be solved when dealing with a HLNW \n\nrepository. This is why today we find in the scientific literature a considerable amount of \n\nwork dealing with hydrogeochemical numerical models applied in the context of the deep \n\ngeological repository. \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n17 \n\nIn the SKB programme that supports the decision making process for sitting the first deep \n\ngeological repository in Sweden one may find a considerable amount of technical reports \n\ndealing with hydrogeochemical modelling (these reports may be downloaded from the \n\nwebsite http://www.skb.se). From this programme, many scientific articles have also been \n\npublished (the reader is referred to the special issue, volume 23, issue 7 of Applied \n\nGeochemistry, published in 2008, and the special issue volume 35, issue 8 of Ambio \n\nJournal, published in 2006).  \n\n \n\n1.4.2 Hydrogeochemical models in the context of the HLNW management \n\nDifferent types of reactive transport models have been developed in the past decades in \n\nthe context of the HLNW management. These include numerical models that simulate: \n\n1. the dissolution of the spent nuclear fuel and subsequent release of radionuclides \n\ninto the aqueous phase (Bruno et al., 2004; Duro et al., 2006; Haschkea and \n\nOversby , 2002; Johnson et al., 2005; Macedo et al., 1982; Nielsen, 2007) \n\n2. the processes occurring at the near-field of a repository, i.e. the vicinity of the \n\ncopper canisters that contain the spent nuclear fuel (Arcos et al., 2008; Jolley et \n\nal., 2003; Ochs et al., 2003; Puranen et al., 2009; Samper et al., 2008; Yamaguchi \n\net al., 2008) \n\n3. the processes occurring at the far-field, i.e. the host rock of the repository and the \n\nmore recent sediments that overly the host rock (Molinero et al., 2008; Robinson et \n\nal., 2003; Sullivan et al., 2003; Thorne et al 2000; Turner and Pabalan, 1999) \n\n \n\nConcerning the dissolution of the spent nuclear fuel, Bruno et al. (2004) developed an \n\noverview of the conceptual models that describe radioactive waste/water interactions with \n\nspecial emphasis on UO2-rich spent nuclear fuel. By combining thorough laboratory \n\nstudies, comprehensive geochemical modelling and its application to natural analogue \n\nstudies, these authors have provided confidence on the predictions for the repository \n\nperformance. In 2006, Duro et al. evaluated the concentration limits of the radionuclides in \n\nthe near field for different scenarios and calculated their solubility limits; i.e. the maximum \n\nconcentration expected for the radionuclides taking into account the most favourable \n\nmineral phases that can precipitate and retain radionuclides in the solid phase. Nielsen \n\n(2007) developed mathematical models to simulate the dissolution of spent nuclear fuel \n\nafter a hypothetical damage of the canister. These simulations showed that a steady-state \n\nconcentration of H2O2 (an important oxidant resulting from water radiolysis due to \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n18 \n\nemission of alpha, beta and gamma radiation from the radioactive decay) is reached at \n\nthe fuel surface in a very short time. \n\nIn 2008, Arcos et al. developed 3D numerical models to assess the long-term \n\nhydrogeochemical evolution of the near-field in evolving geochemical environments due to \n\nclimate change. These numerical models gather information from underground laboratory \n\nexperiments and natural analogues. The numerical results indicate that the most \n\nsignificant changes in the evolution of the near-field system could occur when highly \n\ndiluted and alkaline ice-melting water enters into the system. \n\nNatural analogues are natural systems with special characteristics that resemble those \n\nexpected for a deep geological repository, and therefore, they have been object of many \n\nstudies for the performance assessment of these repositories (Miller et al., 1994; Miller et \n\nal., 2000; Miller et al., 2006, among others). In 1990, Nordstrom et al. performed \n\ngeochemical simulations of water-rock interactions at the Po\u00e7os de Caldas natural \n\nanalogue using groundwater compositions, mineralogical data, speciation and mass \n\nbalance calculations. The models developed were able to reproduce water chemistry and \n\nmineral occurrences. The dominant hydrogeochemical processes occurring at the Po\u00e7os \n\nde Caldas site were also identified. This work provided testing thermodynamic equilibrium \n\ncodes and their associated databases. Afterwards, in 1991, Bruno et al. performed \u201cblind\u201d \n\npredictive geochemical models for the speciation and solubility limiting phases of a \n\nnumber of trace elements of Po\u00e7os de Caldas natural analogue to test geochemical \n\nmodels used in repository performance assessments. One of the major findings of this \n\nstudy was that neglecting processes such as co-precipitation of radionuclides with major \n\nion phases, which were not included in the models due to the lack of appropriate data, led \n\nto conservative (pessimistic) results by overestimating radionuclide concentration. \n\nFrom the beginning of 1990\u2019s until the present, new thermodynamic and kinetic data, as \n\nwell as improved understanding of specific geochemical processes (e.g. biochemical \n\nprocesses) has been achieved which enables the construction of more sound and reliable \n\nreactive transport models. \n\nIn 2004, Salas and Ayora modelled the groundwater system at one of the natural \n\nanalogues of the Oklo uranium deposit to improve the understanding of the observed site \n\ngeochemistry. The methodology adopted in this work was useful to prove the reliability of \n\nthe conceptual and numerical models developed to describe the complex behaviour of the \n\nnatural analogue at the Ok\u00e9lobondo uraninite deposit. \n\nBesides predictive models of the repository system and natural analogue models, \n\ndescriptive models of the candidate sites are important tools providing confidence on the \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n19 \n\nnumerical tools used, assumptions made and conceptual models defined for the \n\ncandidate sites. Molinero et al. (2008) developed a coupled regional groundwater flow and \n\nreactive solute transport model of the Simpevarp area (one of the two candidate sites that \n\nwere under consideration by SKB). By providing a qualitative framework for data analysis \n\nand testing of conceptual assumptions in a process-oriented approach, the results of this \n\nwork have demonstrated how powerful the numerical tools are for the interpretation of \n\nhydrogeochemical data of candidate host rocks. \n\n \n\n1.4.3 Modelling microbially mediated redox reactions in the context of the \n\ndeep geological repository \n\nModelling microbially mediated geochemical reactions in the context of deep geological \n\nrepositories is not as widespread as modelling abiotic geochemical reactions. \n\nNevertheless, many geochemical reactions have long been identified to be mediated by \n\nmicrobes (e.g. Chapelle, 1993; Lovley et al., 1991). Hydrogeochemical models accounting \n\nfor microbially mediated geochemical reactions are much more abundant in the field of \n\nsubsurface groundwater modelling (e.g. Hunter et al., 1998), landfill plumes (e.g. Brun et \n\nal., 2002; Christensen et al., 2000) and degradation of organic contaminants such as \n\nchlorinated hydrocarbons, phenol and benzene (Mayer et al., 2001; Prommer et al., 2006; \n\nWatson et al., 2005, among others). \n\nIn 1996, Van Cappellen and Gaillard described sediment biogeochemistry with a detailed \n\ndiscussion on the mathematical formulation of transport fluxes and rates of \n\nbiogeochemical reactions. In the same volume, Rittmann and VanBriesen (1996) \n\ndeveloped a proper formulation for incorporating microbiological reactions into reactive \n\ntransport models. As will be shown in Chapter 2 of this thesis, the formulation developed \n\nby Rittman and VanBriesen (1996) has been successfully applied to the numerical model \n\ndeveloped. \n\nBy catalysing geochemical redox reactions, microbes often contribute to maintain the \n\nredox potential of groundwater at a low level which enhances the geochemical stability of \n\na deep geological repository (Pedersen, 1999). \n\nIn 1996, Banwart et al. identified organic carbon oxidation induced by large-scale shallow \n\nwater intrusion into a vertical fracture zone at the \u00c4sp\u00f6 Hard Rock Laboratory in Sweden. \n\nThese authors concluded that surface water inflow due to excavation of a tunnel in a \n\nrepository host rock adds reducing capacity in the form of organic carbon, implying that \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n20 \n\nthe soil cover may provide important protection against input of dissolved oxygen to \n\nfractures drained during the open phase of the repository. \n\nIn 2004, Arcos et al. developed a numerical model using PHREEQC to simulate the Pore \n\nWater Chemistry (PC) Experiment in the Opalinus Clay at Switzerland. This model \n\naccounted for diffusional flow and transport coupled to several local equilibrium and \n\nkinetic geochemical reactions and microbially driven degradation of organic matter. The \n\nmodel was able to describe the redox evolution of the system, indicating the adequacy of \n\nconsidering the role of microbially driven organic matter oxidation. \n\nYang et al. (2007) developed a coupled hydrobiogeochemical model, accounting for \n\ndissolved organic carbon (DOC) respiration and methane oxidation, to evaluate the \n\ngeochemical and microbial consumption of dissolved oxygen (DO) in bentonite porewater \n\nafter backfilling a HLNW repository. Parameters for microbial processes were derived \n\nfrom calibration of an in situ experiment carried out at the \u00c4spo underground laboratory in \n\nSweden. Numerical results showed that both geochemical and microbial processes are \n\nrelevant for DO consumption. \n\nSince microbial processes can directly affect repository performance Jolley et al. (2003) \n\ndeveloped a model to predict the quantity of microbial biomass that could be generated \n\nover time as a result of emplacement of the HLNW packages at Yucca Mountain, in \n\nsouthern Nevada. The model uses the MING code (Ehrhorn and Jolley, 1998) which is \n\nbased on environmental thresholds for limiting microbial growth in the near field of a \n\nrepository. \n\nIn the context of the near-field geochemical stability, King et al. (2008) developed a \n\nreactive transport model to predict the corrosion behaviour of the copper canisters within a \n\ndeep geological repository, accounting for aerobic bacteria respiration which was \n\npredicted to be the main O2 reduction process during the preliminary stages of the \n\nrepository evolution.  \n\nBesides promoting the geochemical stability of a deep geological repository by \n\nmaintaining relatively reducing geochemical conditions, microbes can directly interact with \n\nradionuclides. In order to evaluate radionuclide migration in a shallow carbonate-rock \n\naquifer, accounting for microbially-driven redox reactions, Wang and Papenguth (2001) \n\nproposed a general approach to incorporate microbial population dynamics into the \n\nbiogeochemical model developed by Hunter et al. (1998). Wang and Papenguth (2001) \n\nextended this model to include radionuclide redox chemistry and its coupling with major \n\nbiogeochemical processes. The results attained in this work showed that U(VI) can be \n\nreduced to insoluble U(IV) in anoxic zones triggered by microbial activity. Roden and \n\n\n\nI. Introduction \n\n21 \n\nScheibe (2005) reached similar conclusions by developing numerical simulations of \n\nbacterial U(VI) reduction which considered flow of anaerobic groundwater with and without \n\nacetate as an electron donor. The addition of acetate favoured the reduction of U(VI) to \n\ninsoluble U(IV) (uraninite) by dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria. \n\n \n\n1.5 Objectives \n\nThe overall objective of this thesis is to develop hydrogeochemical conceptual models and \n\nnumerical simulations that integrate laboratory experimental results, site specific data and \n\nthermodynamic databases to assess the influence of geochemical and microbially-driven \n\nprocesses on radionuclide migration, in near-surface systems. \n\nThe main goal of the work presented in Chapter 2 is to develop a conceptual and \n\nnumerical model that is able to describe and simulate the processes observed in the jar-\n\nfermentor experiment developed by JAEA, with special focus on the microbially-driven \n\nredox sequence from O2 reduction to methanogenesis. Besides simulation of direct \n\nparameters such as the concentration of organic electron donors and inorganic electron \n\nacceptors, the numerical model is intended to accurately simulate measured, with special \n\nemphasis on the master variables redox potential and pH. In order to develop such a \n\nsound and complete model, the partial equilibrium approach has been chosen for \n\nmodelling microbially-driven geochemical reactions. \n\nThe objective of the work presented in Chapters 3 and 4 is to develop a reliable \n\nconceptual model and reactive solute transport numerical simulations to predict the \n\nmigration and retention of radionuclides derived from a hypothetical repository release in \n\nthe near-surface systems of the site selected for the construction of a deep geological \n\nrepository in Sweden (Forsmark). In order to build such reliable numerical simulations a \n\ncomplete modelling procedure is developed and tested on two different scenarios: (1) the \n\nfirst scenario entails a glacial clay deposit that underlies surface water bodies and is \n\nrelated to groundwater discharge areas at Forsmark, and the (2) second scenario \n\nsimulates a shallow unconfined aquifer hosted by a till deposit that discharges to surface \n\nwater bodies, such as streams, lakes or the Baltic Sea. \n\nAt Forsmark the till deposit covers most of the surface of the granitic bedrock. Associated \n\nto surface water bodies, glacial clays can be found between the lake sediments and the till \n\ndeposit, meaning that the glacial clays and till deposit are most likely hydraulically \n\nconnected (Johansson et al., 2005). This feature has motivated us to initially \n\nconceptualize and model the two sediments in a single reactive transport numerical \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n22 \n\nmodel. Nevertheless some difficulties have arisen which are related to both the \n\nunderstanding and the numerical implementation of the hydrodynamic and geochemical \n\nprocesses responsible for the differentiation between both sediments. Therefore, we have \n\ndecided to model the glacial clay and till deposits in two separate numerical models which \n\nare described in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. \n\nWhile Chapter 2 deals with a descriptive numerical model where the main goal is to fit \n\nsimulated data to measured data and therefore improve our understanding on the \n\ngeochemical processes triggered by microbial activity, and prove the reliability of the \n\nconceptual model that underlies the numerical model, Chapters 3 and 4 deal with \n\npredictive simulations that rely on the present-day knowledge of the hydrodynamic and \n\ngeochemical behaviour of the near-surface systems at Forsmark. Here, the main focus is \n\nput on the predictive capacity of the simulations.  \n\nThe model presented in Chapter 2 is focused in smaller scale processes, such as the \n\nevolution of pH and redox potential triggered by microbial activity, while Chapters 3 and 4 \n\nare focused on larger and hydrodynamic systems where coupling between geochemical \n\nprocesses, groundwater flow and solute transport play a major role. \n\nBy considering groundwater flow and transport of solutes, the models developed in \n\nChapters 3 and 4 provide a wider perspective of radionuclide mobility in the near-surface \n\nsystems. Chapter 5 provides an ultimate upscaling of all the processes responsible for \n\nradionuclide mobility in the Quaternary till, by transforming the complex and mechanistic \n\napproach that underlies the reactive transport numerical model presented in Chapter 4 \n\ninto a simpler and CPU more efficient Kd-based model. In this context, the work presented \n\nin this thesis can be viewed as a progressive upscaling from hydrogeochemical retention \n\nprocesses to effective retardation parameters.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nI.

In aquatic systems, microbial respiration oxidizes organic carbon whilst \n\nreduces inorganic components such as O2, NO3\n-\n, Fe\n\n3+\n, SO4\n\n2-\n and C(IV) which, in turn, \n\ntriggers changes in key geochemical parameters such as pH and redox potential. The \n\ninorganic carbon system is also influenced by microbial respiration and growth. In this \n\ncontext, a jar-fermentor experiment with lake water and sediment samples was conducted \n\nby the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) to assess the role of microbial activity in \n\naquatic systems. During the experiment, the main geochemical parameters were \n\nmeasured. A numerical model has been developed in order to simulate the jar-fermentor \n\nexperiment and quantify the role of each microbial group that is believed to influence the \n\ngeochemical evolution observed. Monod kinetic equations have been implemented to \n\nsimulate microbially mediated reactions. Abiotic, kinetic and equilibrium, geochemical \n\nreactions have also been considered. Reduction of O2, NO3\n-\n, Fe\n\n3+\n and SO4\n\n2-\n, lactate \n\nfermentation, evolution of pH and Eh, and production of CO2(g) and CH4(g) are well \n\nreproduced by the model. There is a relatively high uncertainty related to the values of the \n\nMonod kinetic parameters; very similar numerical solutions can be attained with different \n\ncombinations of the Monod parameters. \n\n \n\nKeywords: redox reactions; microbial activity; HLNW; jar-fermentor; (bio)geochemical \n\nmodelling. \n\n                                                \n\n1\n This work has been presented as a poster at the 19th Annual V.M.

The build \n\nup of new biomass requires nutrients, such as C, H, N, and O, from available organic \n\nmatter and other sources to form new organic cells. On the other hand, microbial \n\nrespiration oxidizes organic carbon whilst reduces inorganic components such as O2, \n\nSO4\n2-\n, NO3\n\n-\n, Fe\n\n3+\n, and C(IV) (Chapelle, 1993; Lovley et al., 1991; Rittmann and \n\nVanBriesen, 1996; Van Cappellen and Gaillard, 1996; von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993). \n\nDue to the interaction with inorganic components, microbial respiration triggers changes in \n\nkey geochemical parameters such as redox potential and pH. \n\nMicrobial activity involves using carbon from organic matter to build up new biomass cells \n\nand to respire. Building up new biomass leads to the transfer of carbon from the organic \n\nmatter substances to the new biomass cells (Chapelle, 1993). When the microbial \n\npopulation decreases (i.e., the living organisms die), this carbon that was incorporated in \n\nbiomass can degrade and be transformed again into an organic non-living matter, and \n\nultimately be oxidized to inorganic carbon. Besides the build up of biomass, microbial \n\nrespiration can act as a catalyser for the oxidation of carbon present in organic matter to \n\ninorganic carbon, which may divert into different physical states of inorganic carbon, such \n\nas HCO3\n-\n(aq), CO2(g) or even as carbonate minerals like calcite. Methanogenesis, a type \n\nof anaerobic respiration where carbon is the terminal electron acceptor (Thauer, 1998), \n\nalso induces changes on the oxidation state of carbon, from C(0) in organic matter or \n\nC(IV) in carbon dioxide, to C(-IV) in methane. Microbial activity is, therefore, able of \n\ntriggering the partitioning of carbon initially present in organic matter, through the three \n\nphases (aqueous, gaseous and solid) which also involves changes on the oxidation state \n\nof carbon. \n\nPerformance assessment of deep geological repositories for HLNW must include \n\npredictions for the long-term geochemical evolution of these repositories. A deep \n\ngeological repository accounts for several engineered (metallic canisters, bentonite, and \n\ncement) and natural (host rocks like granite, and surface sediments) barriers that prevent \n\nradionuclides, present in HLNW, from escaping to the surrounding natural environment \n\nand eventually interact with the surface ecosystems. \n\nPrediction of the geochemical evolution of a deep geological repository must provide \n\nreliable estimates for the long-term geochemical integrity of the metallic canisters that \n\nprevent direct contact between groundwater and the HLNW. Puigdom\u00e8nech and Taxen \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n33 \n\n(2000) concluded that dissolved oxygen (DO) and sulphide (HS\n-\n(aq)) in groundwater are \n\nthe most damaging components for copper corrosion. In addition, if a copper canister \n\nbecomes damaged; leading to direct contact between groundwater and the HLNW, a \n\npredominately reducing environment will mitigate the mobility of most radionuclides, e.g. \n\nU, Th and Se (Duro et al., 2006). \n\nMicrobes may be present at repository depth (which is about 500 m), and therefore \n\nmicrobial activity could influence the geochemical evolution of a deep geological \n\nrepository (Ajima et al., 2008; Banwart, 1999; and, Yang et al., 2007). \n\nMicrobial activity may have a two folded role on the geochemical evolution of metallic \n\ncanisters. On one hand, microbial activity favours the integrity of a copper canister by \n\nreducing DO but on the other hand, by reducing sulphate to sulphide, microbial activity \n\nmay contribute to the corrosive attack of a copper canister. \n\nIn the last years, JAEA has been performing laboratory experiments to assess the role of \n\nmicrobial activity in the geochemical evolution of aquatic systems (Nakajima et al., 2008 \n\nand Todaka et al., 2007). Here, a numerical model of a jar-fermentor experiment with lake \n\nwater and sediment samples that were oxidized by atmosphere bubbling is developed. \n\nLactate was added to the jar-fermentor which was kept in closed conditions for \n\napproximately 13 days. During the experiment the main geochemical parameters and \n\nbacterial flora were analyzed (Nakajima et al., 2008). \n\nIn the present work, the main biotic and abiotic processes that are believed to occur in the \n\njar-fermentor experiment have been identified and implemented in a numerical model \n\nusing PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). The numerical model follows the partial \n\nequilibrium approach, in which the oxidation of organic matter is considered to be the rate \n\nlimiting process, and the geochemical system is led to respond under local equilibrium by \n\nreducing the most thermodynamically favourable electron acceptor (EA). In addition, \n\ninhibition terms are used to describe mathematically the sequential use of EA\u2019s (Barry et \n\nal., 2002, and references therein). \n\n \n\n2.2 Experimental set up \n\nThe jar-fermentor experiment consists of a reactor with a capacity of 2.3 L in which 20 g of \n\nlake sediment were mixed with 2 L of lake water, at a constant temperature of 30\u00baC. The \n\njar-fermentor was kept with a headspace of 5 mL. The sediment suspension was oxidized \n\nby atmosphere bubbling and stirred at 300 rpm. After 5 days, a solution of sodium lactate \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n34 \n\n(final concentration of 10 mM) was added to the reactor which was kept in closed \n\nconditions for further 8 days (Figure 2.1). During the experiment, pH, DO concentration \n\nand redox potential data were monitored automatically by a data logger. In addition, water \n\nand gas samples were collected periodically for measuring selected parameters. DNA \n\nfrom microbes in the sediment suspension was also collected and bacterial flora analysis \n\nwas carried out by PCR-DGGE method. The system was sterilized by autoclave and \n\ntreatment by sodium azide (NaN3, final concentration of 10 mM) in order to prevent \n\nmicrobial contamination. \n\nThe main mineral components of the sediment sample used in the experiment have been \n\nidentified by XRD analysis. These are quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, pyrite, calcite and \n\nclay minerals (smectite and kaolinite). Redox potential and pH of the sediment suspension \n\nwere measured by ORP electrode (platinum electrode) and pH electrode (glass \n\nelectrode). DO concentration was measured by DO electrode (diaphragm galvanic cell \n\nmethod). Dissolved anion concentrations (NO3\n-\n, NO2\n\n-\n, SO4\n\n2-\n, lactic acid ion, propionate \n\nion, acetic acid ion, formic acid ion and pyruvate ion) were measured by ion \n\nchromatograph (DIONEX, ICS-1500 and ICS-2000). In the headspace, CO2(g) and CH4(g) \n\nconcentrations were measured by gas chromatography (Varian, CP4900 with TCD \n\ndetector). \n\n \n\n20g lake sediment\n\n2L lake water\n\n5mL headspace\n\n120 hours\n\nAir \n\nbubbling\n\n220 hours\n\nMicrobially mediated \n\nredox reactions\n\nAddition \n\nof lactate \n\n(10mM)\n\nCLOSED CONDITIONS\n\nNumerical model\n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Sketch of the jar-fermentor experiment.

Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n35 \n\n2.3 Conceptual model \n\n2.3.1 Evidences from experimental results \n\nThe jar-fermentor experiment may be viewed as a two steps experiment: (1) the first step \n\nconcerns the period when the system is being disturbed due to bubbling, and (2) the \n\nsecond step begins when bubbling stops and lactate is added to the system which is kept \n\nin closed conditions. The present work is focused on understanding and modelling the \n\nresults attained during the second step of the experiment, and therefore the initial \n\nconditions of the numerical model refer to the time when lactate is added to the jar-\n\nfermentor (Figure 2.1). \n\nAfter the addition of lactate, the overall behaviour of the jar-fermentor shows a decrease \n\nof pe\n2\n from approximately 8 to -4, and pH shows a small decrease during the first 70 \n\nhours towards a circum-neutral pH that is maintained until the end of the experiment \n\n(Figure 2.2).  \n\n(a) \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\np\nH\n\n \n\n       (b) \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\np\ne\n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Measured time evolution of pH and pe in the jar-fermentor experiment. \n\n \n\nDO and nitrate are reduced within the first 10 hours (data will be shown in section 2.5). \n\nAfter the reduction of these species, lactate fermentation leads to the production of \n\npropionate and acetate. As lactate fermentation becomes less important, sulphate is \n\n                                                \n\n2\n In analogy to pH, pe= -log[e-]. pe was calculated from the Eh values measured during the \n\nexperiment by, firstly correct measured Eh, relative to the platinum electrode, to Eh values that are \n\nrelative to the standard hydrogen electrode (the reader is referred to p. 420 in Appelo and Postma, \n\n2005, for further reading on this subject). Then, corrected Eh values were transformed into pe \n\nvalues, by using the equation 9.22 in Appelo and Postma, 2005. \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n36 \n\nprogressively reduced, and ferrous iron concentration increases. Methanogenesis is \n\nevidenced by the increase of methane in the headspace gas and also by the maintenance \n\nof a pe of -4 during the last 50 hours of the experiment. Besides methane, the partial \n\npressure of carbon dioxide also increases in the headspace gas, reflecting the \n\naccumulation of the end-products of organic matter oxidation and methanogenesis (Figure \n\n2.3). \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nD\nO\n\n (\nm\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nL\na\n\nc\nta\n\nte\n, \nA\n\nc\ne\n\nta\nte\n\n,\nP\n\nro\np\n\nio\nn\n\na\nte\n\n (\nm\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\n   (b) \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0.00\n\n0.40\n\n0.80\n\n1.20\n\n1.60\n\nS\nO\n\n4\n2\n- ,\n F\n\ne\n2\n+\n (\n\nm\nm\n\no\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n0.000\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n0.003\n\n0.004\n\nP\n(C\n\nH\n4\n)\n\n \n\nDO;        Lactate;        Acetate;\nPropionate  \n\n   SO4\n2-;        Fe2+;        CH4 \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Measured time evolution of: a) DO, Lactate, Acetate and Propionate in solution; \n\nand, b) SO4\n2-\n\n, Fe\n2+\n\n in solution, and CH4(g) in the headspace gas of the jar-fermentor. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Microbially mediated reactions and abiotic processes \n\nThe observed evolution of the inorganic and organic components in the aqueous and \n\ngaseous phases of the jar-fermentor reflects the occurrence of microbially mediated redox \n\nreactions that oxidize the added lactate and its fermentation products; propionate and \n\nacetate. \n\nMicrobially mediated oxidation and fermentation of lactate have been reported elsewhere \n\n(von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993, among others). According to the evolution of the \n\nparameters measured in the jar-fermentor experiment, the microbially mediated redox \n\nreactions that are believed to occur in the jar-fermentor are: \n\n1) oxidation of lactate with reduction of DO and nitrate; \n\n2) oxidation of propionate with reduction of sulphate and reductive dissolution of \n\nFeOOH; \n\n3) methanogenesis. \n\n \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n37 \n\nFermentation of lactate is also evidenced by the decrease of lactate concentration \n\naccompanied by the increment of propionate and acetate concentration. The microbial \n\ngroups that are believed to mediate the redox reactions occurring in the jar-fermentor \n\nexperiment are listed in Table 2.1. \n\nBesides biotic reactions, abiotic reactions seem to occur in the jar-fermentor experiment. \n\nThese abiotic reactions are evidenced by the general tendency of a relatively stable \n\ncircum-neutral pH which seems to be buffered by calcite equilibrium. If calcite would not \n\nbe present, the biological production of CO2 would most probably lead the system towards \n\nmore acidic conditions than the ones observed. In addition, the evolution of Fe(II) in \n\nsolution reveals that not only microbial activity is influencing its concentration, but also the \n\nprecipitation of Fe(II) secondary phases which tend to lower Fe(II) aqueous concentration \n\nduring the final stage of the jar-fermentor experiment. The precipitation of Fe(II) secondary \n\nphases is most likely triggered by the low pe that prevails during the last stages of the \n\nexperiment, and the increased concentration of bicarbonate and S(-II) which can promote \n\nthe precipitation of FeCO3 and FeS, respectively. It is worth mentioning that FeCO3 rarely \n\nprecipitates as a pure phase but it forms solid solutions with calcium carbonate (ankerite, \n\nCaFe(CO3); Dromgoole and Walter, 1990). The thermodynamics of this solid solution \n\nseries are still not well known, which is why the pure phase is selected for the current \n\nmodel calculations. \n\nAbiotic reductive dissolution of FeOOH (Pyzik and Sommer, 1981) is also expected due to \n\nthe increment of HS\n-\n as a consequence of microbially mediated reduction of S(VI) to S(-II). \n\nFeOOH has not been identified in the primary mineral assemblage of the lake sediment \n\nthat was used for the jar-fermentor experiment. Instead, qualitative analysis of the lake \n\nsediment has identified the presence of pyrite. Nevertheless bubbling of the sediment \n\nperformed during 120 hours, in the first step of the jar-fermentor experiment, may have \n\ntriggered the oxidative dissolution of pyrite (Moses and Herman, 1991; Nicholson et al., \n\n1988) and subsequent precipitation of Fe(III) phases. For this purpose, kinetic calculations \n\nusing PHREEQC were performed to assess the feasibility of pyrite oxidative dissolution \n\n(using the rate expression proposed by Nicholson et al., 1988) in a solution in contact with \n\natmospheric O2, and letting FeOOH precipitate under local equilibrium, during 120 hours. \n\nThe numerical results of these preliminary calculations have proven the possibility for the \n\nstated hypothesis of pyrite oxidation and subsequent precipitation of FeOOH, and, \n\ntherefore FeOOH was considered the main Fe solid phase at the initial conditions of the \n\nnumerical model. \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n38 \n\nThe observed accumulation of CO2 and CH4 in the headspace gas of the jar-fermentor \n\nreflects the accumulation of the main end-products of the biological activity that has \n\noccurred during the experiment. The oxidation of organic matter by microbes leads to the \n\nproduction of CO2 and, when a more reducing environment prevails, reduction of C(IV) \n\nand C(0) from acetate to C(-IV) can be triggered by the activity of methanogens. It should \n\nbe noted that in order to apply the partial equilibrium approach to simulate \n\nmethanogenesis, the local equilibrium reaction describing the reduction of CO2 to CH4: \n\n \n\n)(38)(9)(\n423\n\naqCHOHeaqHaqHCO ????\n???\n\n         log K = 27.8493       (equation 2.1) \n\n \n\nhas been maintained in the thermodynamic database used for the calculations. This has \n\nimplications on the accuracy of the numerical solution attained for the simulation of \n\nmethanogenesis, as will be shown later in section 2.5.1.5. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Summary of the biotic and abiotic reactions implemented in the numerical \n\nsimulation of the jar-fermentor experiment. \n\nReaction Biotic Abiotic \n\nMicrobial group Local equilibrium or \nkinetics \n\nLactate (C3H5O3\n-\n) oxidation - Aerobes \n\n- Denitrifiers \n\n \n\nLactate fermentation - Fermenters  \n\nPropionate (C3H5O2\n-\n) \n\noxidation \n- Sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) \n\n- Iron reducing bacteria (IRB) \n\n \n\nAcetate (C2H3O2\n-\n) reduction - Methanogens  \n\nReduction of O2(aq), NO3\n-\n, \n\nSO4\n2-\n\n, Fe\n3+\n\n, and C(IV) \n Local equilibrium \n\nAbiotic reductive dissolution \nof FeOOH \n\n Kinetics \n\nPrecipitation of S(0)  Kinetics \n\nPrecipitation of FeCO3  Kinetics \n\nPrecipitation of FeS  Kinetics \n\nPrecipitation/ dissolution of \nCaCO3 \n\n Local equilibrium \n\nCation exchange in smectite  Local equilibrium \n\nReduction of CO2(aq) to \nCH4(aq) \n\n Local equilibrium \n\n  \n\nAnalytical data of the lake sediment prior to the jar-fermentor experiment show the \n\npresence of Ca and Fe, among other elements, in the solid phase.

Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n39 \n\nto calcite and smectite while Fe is most likely linked to smectite and pyrite (the later being \n\noxidised in the first stage of the experiment as indicated above). In smectite interlayer, \n\ncations such as Na\n+\n, Ca\n\n2+\n, and Fe\n\n2+\n may exchange (Fletcher and Sposito, 1989), and \n\ntherefore, the numerical simulations account for the presence of smectite with \n\nexchangeable sites for these cations. \n\nThe amount of smectite defined in the numerical model was set according to the amount \n\nof Na reported in the lake sediment used in the experiment. Analytical data of the lake \n\nsediment show the presence of 1.37 wt% of Na in the sediment, and assuming that all Na \n\nin the solid phase is linked to smectite (with a theoretical chemical formula of \n\n(Na,Ca)(Al,Mg)6(Si4O10)3(OH)6, and molar weight of 1287 g/mol) a total of 1.2 \u00d7 10\n-2\n mol of \n\nsmectite in 20 g of sediment are obtained. Knowing that 20 g of sediment were mixed with \n\n2 L of water, 6 \u00d7 10\n-3\n mol of smectite per litre of water are obtained. In addition, since the \n\njar-fermentor experiment was conducted within a circum-neutral pH, smectite dissolution \n\nhas been neglected, and therefore the total amount of exchangeable sites is kept constant \n\nthroughout the simulation.  \n\nFrom elemental analysis of the sediment, a concentration of 3.1 wt% of Ca is reported. \n\nAssuming that almost all Ca in the solid phase is linked to calcite, an initial concentration \n\nof 3 \u00d7 10\n-3\n mol of calcite per litre of water is estimated. Calcite dissolution and precipitation \n\nhave been considered to occur under local equilibrium (Table 2.1). \n\nAs already mentioned, the pe of the system at the moment of lactate addition is 8 which is \n\nfar from equilibrium with pyrite (a pe of -3 would be attained if the initial solution is \n\nequilibrated with pyrite). In this context, pyrite has been discarded from the initial mineral \n\nassemblage of the simulation and, in turn, FeOOH is considered to be present when \n\nlactate is added. From elemental analysis of the sediment, a concentration of 8.4 wt% of \n\nFe is reported, and assuming that almost all Fe in the solid phase is linked to FeOOH, we \n\nobtain an initial concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\n-2\n mol of FeOOH per litre of water. In the numerical \n\nmodel, dissolution of FeOOH is considered to be kinetically controlled both by biotic and \n\nabiotic processes (Table 2.1). The biotic dissolution of FeOOH is believed to be triggered \n\nby propionate oxidation mediated by IRB\u2019s (e.g. Lovley et al., 1991, von Gunten and \n\nZobrist, 1993), while the abiotic kinetic dissolution of FeOOH corresponds to the reductive \n\ndissolution of FeOOH triggered by the increase of HS\n-\n concentration (Pyzik and Sommer, \n\n1981). \n\nThe occurrence of black precipitates has been reported during the second step of the jar-\n\nfermentor experiment which has been interpreted as an evidence for the precipitation of \n\nFe(II) sulphides. Pyrite precipitation is known to be preceded by the precipitation of FeS \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n40 \n\n(Rickard, 1997) which, in turn, is expected to be kinetically controlled under the prevailing \n\nconditions of the jar-fermentor experiment. For simplicity of the numerical model pyrite \n\nprecipitation has been discarded from the model and only kinetic precipitation of FeS has \n\nbeen considered. The kinetic precipitation of FeS follows the model proposed by Pyzik \n\nand Sommer (1981). \n\nFeCO3 kinetic precipitation has been considered in the numerical model due to the \n\nobserved increase of Fe(II) and C(IV) in solution during the jar-fermentor experiment. \n\nJimenez-Lopez and Romanek (2004) have concluded that kinetic precipitation of FeCO3 \n\nmay occur at 25\u00baC, for saturation indices of FeCO3 that range from 0 to 3.4 \u00d7 10\n3\n. Since \n\nno kinetic rate expression has been found in the literature, the kinetic model proposed by \n\nPyzik and Sommer (1981) for FeS has been modified to express the kinetic precipitation \n\nof FeCO3. \n\n \n\n2.4 Numerical model \n\nNumerical models are used worldwide in order to assess the influence of microbial \n\nrespiration on the geochemical evolution of groundwaters (Banwart, 1999, Watson et al., \n\n2005, Brun and Engesgaard, 2002). The majority of these works concerns the \n\ndegradation of organic contaminants such as phenol, tetrachloroethene, and benzene \n\n(Mayer et al., 2001, Watson et al., 2005, among others) in order to assess the efficiency of \n\nnatural attenuation and bioremediation practices. \n\nThe present work describes a model for the oxidation of lactate and two intermediates \n\n(acetate and propionate) by microbially mediated redox reactions that are believed to \n\noccur in the jar-fermentor experiment developed by Nakajima et al. (2008). \n\n \n\n2.4.1 Mathematical model \n\n2.4.1.1 Partial equilibrium and extended Monod growth model \n\nAs already mentioned in section 2.1, the numerical model that has been developed to \n\nsimulate microbially mediated redox reactions follows the so called partial equilibrium \n\napproach (Barry et al., 2002; Brun and Engesgaard, 2002). According to this approach, \n\nthe oxidation of organic matter and reduction of inorganic EA\u2019s is divided in two half-\n\nreactions: (1) oxidation of organic matter which is treated kinetically (considered being the \n\nrate limiting process); and, (2) reduction of inorganic EA\u2019s which is let to occur under local \n\n\n\nII.

This model accounts for limitation terms for both the organic matter \n\nbeing oxidized and the EA being reduced, and an inhibition term.

In this situation microbial \n\nbiomass is growing. On the other hand, if the concentration of an ED and/or EA is very \n\nlow, the rate of oxidation of ED is a small negative number which makes rnet\nMic\n\n negative. \n\nUnder these conditions the biomass is decreasing which simulates the decay of microbial \n\npopulation. \n\nIn equation 2.2, as higher the half-saturation constant (for ED or EA) as lower the rate of \n\noxidation of a given ED which means that the microbial group is highly limited by the \n\nconcentration of ED or EA. Finally, as lower the inhibition constant as lower the rate of \n\noxidation of a given ED, meaning that the microbial group is strongly inhibited by the \n\npresence of the inhibitor species. If this inhibition term is extremely low (lower than ~10\n-10\n\n), \n\nthe term for inhibition in equation 2.2 will exert a mechanism in the mathematical \n\nexpression similar to that of a switch function that has already been implemented by \n\nothers (Brun and Engesgaard, 2002). When the inhibition term is high it means that the \n\nactivity of a given microbial group may overlap the activity of another microbial group as \n\nalready reported for SRB\u2019s and IRB\u2019s (Watson et al., 2005, among others). \n\nIn order to simulate the influence of growing and decaying biomass over the inorganic \n\ncomposition of the solution where the biological activity is taking place, the composition of \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n43 \n\none mole of biomass has been considered to be C5H7O2N. This representation of the \n\nchemical composition of biomass has been used by others (Rittmann and VanBriesen, \n\n1996, Barry et al., 2002, Brun and Engesgaard, 2002). By assuming this chemical \n\ncomposition for the biomass, when a given microbial group decays, C, H, O and N will be \n\nadded to solution at the proportion expressed by the stoichiometry of the molecule \n\nC5H7O2N. On the other hand, if a given microbial group is growing these elements will be \n\nremoved from solution according to the same stoichiometry. \n\nIn Table 2.2, the ED, EA and inhibitor species are summarised for each microbial group \n\nconsidered in the numerical simulation. \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 \u2013 Summary of the ED\u2019s, EA\u2019s and inhibitors implemented for each microbial group. \n\nMicrobial group ED or fermentation reactant EA Inhibitor \n\nAerobes Lactate O2 - \n\nDenitrifiers Lactate NO3\n-\n O2 \n\nFermenters Lactate  NO3\n-\n \n\nIRB Propionate FeOOH NO3\n-\n \n\nSRB Propionate SO4\n2-\n\n Fe(III) \n\nMethanogens  Acetate NO3\n-\n \n\n \n\n2.4.1.2 Numerical tool and thermodynamic database \n\nThe numerical simulations have been performed with the geochemical code PHREEQC \n\n(Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). This code solves a wide variety of low-temperature \n\ngeochemical reactions, including aqueous speciation, dissolution and precipitation of pure \n\nphases and solid solutions, surface complexation, ion exchange and kinetically controlled \n\nreactions. PHREEQC was selected to develop a numerical model of the jar-fermentor \n\nexperiment following the partial equilibrium approach because: \n\n\u2022 It provides an extremely versatile tool for user-defined kinetic rate expressions, \n\noffering the possibility for the user to define the algorithms that describe each rate \n\nexpression under consideration. This is possible because PHREEQC has an \n\nembedded BASIC language interpreter (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999); and, \n\n\u2022 It is a robust and widely benchmarked geochemical code where the mass action \n\nequations that describe the thermodynamic equilibrium reactions needed to be \n\nconsidered in a partial equilibrium approach are correctly simulated. \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n44 \n\nThe thermodynamic database used in the present study is the NAGRA-PSI database, \n\ncompiled by Hummel et al., 2002. This database contains a large set of complexation \n\nreactions as well as pure mineral equilibrium reactions for major elements and many trace \n\nelements. Additional Fe(III) carbonate complexes (Griv\u00e9, 2005) have been added to the \n\ndatabase due to the high bicarbonate content expected as a consequence of microbial \n\nrespiration.  \n\n \n\n2.4.1.3 Numerical implementation of the biological activity \n\nTaking the biological activity of denitrifiers as an example, the following paragraphs \n\nexplain how the partial equilibrium approach and extended Monod growth model have \n\nbeen implemented to describe the biological activity of this group. It should be mentioned \n\nthat a similar procedure has been followed for the other microbial groups considered in \n\nthe simulations. \n\nAs shown in Table 2.2, the ED and EA used by denitrifiers are lactate and NO3\n-\n, \n\nrespectively. In order to impede the activity of denitrifiers against aerobic respiration, the \n\npresence of O2 in solution is considered to inhibit the activity of denitrifiers. In the \n\nnumerical simulation, regardless of the speciation of the elements that constitute the \n\nlactate molecule, the kinetic oxidation of lactate by denitrifiers can be described by the \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n \n\nOHCLactate 353 ???                                                                                 (equation 2.4)  \n\n \n\nIn equation 2.4, one mole of lactate oxidized releases three moles of C, five moles of H \n\nand three moles of O into solution which corresponds to the chemical composition of one \n\nmole of lactate. The subsequent speciation of these elements is computed by PHREEQC \n\naccording to the composition, pH and pe of the aqueous solution. \n\nIf we consider the build up of one mole of denitrifiers from the oxidation of lactate, \n\ntheoretically we would get the following half reaction: \n\n \n\n?????\n?????? eaqHlOHaqCOsNOHCaqNHaqOHC 4)(5)()()()()(2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n32754353\n                        \n\n(equation 2.5) \n\n \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n45 \n\nIn equation 2.4 we see that two moles of lactate are needed to produce one mole of \n\nbiomass. This means that ideally the specific yield of denitrifiers would be 0.5 (1 mol of \n\nbiomass per 2 mol of lactate). Nevertheless, laboratory experiments (Barry et al., 2002 \n\nand references therein), and also the numerical results attained in the present work, show \n\nthat microbial growth is not that efficient, meaning that from two moles of lactate less \n\nbiomass is produced in favour of more C(IV) produced. This means that respiration may \n\nbe more important than the build up of new biomass per each mole of lactate used by \n\ndenitrifiers. \n\nCalibration of the numerical model that has been built to simulate the jar-fermentor \n\nexperiment led to a specific yield for denitrifying bacteria of 0.05. By applying this specific \n\nyield in equation 2.5 we obtain the following rate equation for the oxidation of lactate by \n\ndenitrifiers: \n\n \n\n??\n\n???\n\n??\n\n?????\n\neaqH\n\naqCOsNOHClOHaqNHaqOHC\n\n11)(55.15\n\n)(75.2)(05.0)(35.5)(05.0)(\n2\n\n327524353\n                                                                                          \n\n(equation 2.6) \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that the production of C(IV) is expressed in terms of CO3\n2-\n for simplicity. \n\nNevertheless CO3\n2-\n may complexate with H\n\n+\n to form bicarbonate, depending on the pH of \n\nthe solution where the microbially mediated denitrification is taking place. \n\nAs a response to the kinetic reaction expressed in equation 2.6, PHREEQC calculations \n\nlead to the reduction of dissolved NO3\n-\n under local equilibrium. The local equilibrium \n\nequation for the reduction of NO3\n-\n is: \n\n \n\n)(6)(10)(12)(2\n223\n\nlOHaqNeaqHaqNO ????\n???\n\n               log K = 207.2676              \n\n(equation 2.7) \n\n \n\nwhere log K is the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant of the reaction for the \n\nreduction of NO3\n-\n to N2. \n\nTaking equations 2.2 and 2.3 to describe the biological activity of denitrifiers the following \n\nequations are obtained: \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n46 \n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n3\n\n6\n\n34\n\n10)]([\n\n10\n\n][10\n\n][\n\n][10\n\n][\n][105.3\n\n?\n\n?\n\n???\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?????\n\naqOLactate\n\nLactate\n\nNO\n\nNO\nDenitR\n\nLac\n\nDenit   \n\n(equation 2.8) \n\n  \n\n][1005.0\n5\n\nDenitRr\nED\n\nDenit\n\nDenit\n\nnet\n?????\n\n?\n                                                     (equation 2.9) \n\n \n\nwhere RDenit\nLac\n\n is the rate of oxidation of lactate by denitrifiers, [Denit] is the concentration \n\nof denitrifying bacteria population at a given time step (mol of C5H7O2N\u00b7L\n-1\n), [NO3\n\n-\n] is the \n\nconcentration of NO3\n-\n (mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n), [Lactate] is the concentration of lactate (mol of C3H5O3\n\n-\n\u00b7L\n\n-\n\n1\n), and rnet\n\nDenit\n is the net growth rate of denitrifying bacteria at a given time step. \n\nAs for all the other microbial groups, the values of the parameters that describe the \n\nactivity of denitrifiers have been defined through calibration of the numerical model \n\nagainst measured data. This calibration stands on the best agreement between measured \n\nand computed values for the concentration of EA\u2019s, ED\u2019s, and the geochemical \n\nparameters pe and pH in the jar-fermentor experiment. \n\nThe inhibition constant for O2 in equation 2.8 is very low meaning that denitrifiers will be \n\nmore active when O2 concentration is lower than 10\n-10\n\n mol\u00b7L\n-1\n. Such a low inhibition \n\nconstant leads to a sequential use of lactate by aerobes followed by denitrifiers with a \n\nshort overlap lag. \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Initial conditions \n\nSince the partial equilibrium approach that has been applied relies on a strong linkage \n\nbetween kinetic microbial reactions and local equilibrium reactions triggered by microbial \n\nactivity, the initial composition of the aqueous solution, mineral assemblage and \n\nheadspace gas must be defined with the highest completeness possible. The reference \n\nvalues used to establish the initial conditions of the numerical simulation are those \n\nmeasured when lactate is added to the jar-fermentor (i.e. beginning of the second step of \n\nthe experiment). \n\nIn the numerical simulations, and according to measured data, the initial aqueous solution \n\nis considered to be in equilibrium with calcite, and a partial pressure of 1.82 \u00d7 10\n-1\n and \n\n2.51 \u00d7 10\n-3\n, for O2(g) and CO2(g), respectively. This assumption is a simplification of the \n\nreal system of the jar-fermentor at the time of lactate addition. Most probably, at this time, \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n47 \n\nthe system is already in disequilibrium due to the disturbance caused by bubbling which \n\nenhances the interaction between inorganic components, organic matter and microbes. \n\nNevertheless, modelling this experiment under the partial equilibrium approach requires \n\nthe definition of an initial aquatic system that represents a temporary equilibrium, \n\ncontrolled by the mass action law, between aqueous, gaseous and solid phases. Based \n\non the conceptual model previously described in section 2.3 and measured data at time of \n\nlactate addition, the following assumptions have been made (Table 2.3): \n\n1. Calcite is considered to be present, at equilibrium, with an amount of 3 \u00d7 10\n-3\n \n\nmol\u00b7L\n-1\n. This equilibrium leads to a concentration of Ca\n\n2+\n(aq) of 9.39 \u00d7 10\n\n-4\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n. \n\n2. The partial pressure of CO2(g) measured in the headspace gas (2.51 \u00d7 10\n-3\n) leads \n\nto an aqueous concentration of C(IV) of 3.75 \u00d7 10\n-3\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n. \n\n3. The initial partial pressure of CH4(g) measured in the headspace gas is 3.02 \u00d7 10\n-4\n\n \n\nwhich is not thermodynamically compatible with a partial pressure of CO2(g) of 2.51 \n\n\u00d7 10\n-3\n and a pe of 8, as it was measured at time zero. Since the initial system is \n\nbelieved to have a partial pressure of CO2(g) and a pe close to the values actually \n\nmeasured at time zero, the initial partial pressure of CH4(g) has been calculated by \n\nprescribing the CO2(g) partial pressure measured at time zero, and letting \n\nPHREEQC calculate the corresponding partial pressure for CH4(g). The value \n\nobtained for the initial partial pressure of CH4(g) is 6.03 \u00d7 10\n-142\n\n which is extremely \n\nlow, reflecting the prevailing oxidizing conditions for the initial state of the jar-\n\nfermentor experiment.  \n\n4. O2(aq) concentration is influenced by the partial pressure of O2(g) in the \n\nheadspace gas. Measured concentration of O2(aq) (2.12 \u00d7 10\n-4\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n) is not in \n\nequilibrium with a partial pressure of O2(g) of 1.82 \u00d7 10\n-1\n, as it was measured when \n\nlactate was added. To build up the initial conditions of the numerical model, the \n\nconcentration of O2(aq) is given more importance than the partial pressure of O2(g) \n\nmeasured in the headspace. Therefore, the initial partial pressure of O2(g) was set \n\nby equilibrating the headspace gas with the measured concentration of O2(aq), \n\nusing PHREEQC. The initial partial pressure obtained for O2(g) is 9.04 \u00d7 10\n-1\n. After \n\nthese equilibrium calculations, O2(aq) concentration is slightly changed to 2.09 \u00d7 \n\n10\n-4\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n. \n\n5. In addition to O2(g), CO2(g) and CH4(g) measured in the headspace gas, H2S(g), \n\nN2(g) and H2(g) are let to accumulate in the headspace gas during the simulation \n\nof the experiment. The selection of these gases was set according to the main \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n48 \n\nend-products of the microbially mediated redox reactions considered in the \n\nnumerical model and their initial partial pressures were set according to the output \n\nof preliminary PHREEQC geochemical calculations. \n\n6. As mentioned in section 2.3.2, FeOOH is considered to be present at an initial \n\nconcentration of 1 \u00d7 10\n-2\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n. The concentration of this mineral during the \n\nexperiment is considered to be influenced solely by kinetic processes: biotic \n\n(respiration of IRB) and abiotic (reductive dissolution of FeOOH by HS\n-\n). According \n\nto the reaction proposed by Pyzik and Sommer (1981), S\n0\n precipitates as a \n\nconsequence of abiotic reductive dissolution of FeOOH. S\n0\n is considered to be \n\nabsent at time zero. \n\n7. Due to the prevailing oxidizing conditions at time zero, FeS is considered to be \n\nabsent at the beginning of the experiment but is let precipitate according to the \n\nkinetic rate expression proposed by Pyzik and Sommer (1981). This assumption, \n\ntogether with the microbially mediated redox reactions leads to the precipitation of \n\nFeS during the simulation which is in agreement with the observation of black \n\nprecipitates as mentioned in section 2.3.2. FeCO3 is also considered to be absent \n\nat the beginning of the experiment, due to the same reason as for FeS. \n\n \n\nThe preliminary geochemical equilibrium calculations performed in PHREEQC for the set \n\nup of the initial aqueous solution, gas and solid compositions led to pe (12.36) and pH \n\n(7.75) values that are different from the ones actually measured at time zero (pe = 8.31 \n\nand pH = 8.08). Nevertheless, since the real system is not in equilibrium and these are \n\nindirect geochemical parameters that depend on equilibrium calculations, it was decided \n\nto attribute a higher level of confidence to the concentrations of the aqueous, gaseous and \n\nsolid species measured, and the initial value of the indirect parameters pe and pH has \n\nbeen defined according to the output of these preliminary PHREEQC calculations (Table \n\n2.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nII.

The criteria for this calibration have been set, with a progressively \n\ndecreasing weight, by finding the best agreement between measured and simulated \n\nvalues of: \n\n1) aqueous concentration of inorganic EA\u2019s; \n\n2) aqueous concentration of organic species: lactate, propionate and acetate. \n\n3) pH; \n\n4) pe; \n\n5) gaseous concentration of CO2 and CH4. \n\nSuch calibration has led to an overall good agreement between numerical results and \n\nmeasured data, as will be shown in section 2.5. \n\nAccording to the criteria used for calibration, the values listed in Table 2.4 (Reference \n\ncase) have been attained for the parameters of the numerical model implemented. During \n\ncalibration of the numerical model, the influence of each parameter on the shape of the \n\ncurve that describes the evolution of each EA has been analysed. \n\nThe initial concentration of biomass for each microbial group has been found to influence \n\nthe initial trend of the curve; as higher the initial concentration of biomass as earlier the \n\nconsumption of the corresponding EA. On the other hand, when the initial concentration of \n\nbiomass is very low, a plateau may be formed in the initial stage, meaning that the redox \n\nprocess is developing at a very small rate, as observed for the case of sulphate reduction \n\n(section 2.5.1.3). \n\nA high specific yield (Y\nBact\n\n) tends to increase the slope of the curve of consumption of a \n\ngiven EA (as for the case of DO and NO3\n-\n, section 2.5.1.1), while a low specific yield tends \n\nto decrease this slope (e.g. sulphate reduction, section 2.5.1.3). The maximum rate of \n\noxidation of ED (qmED\nBact\n\n) exerts a great influence on the time at which the optimum of a \n\ngiven microbial group occurs. Finally, the half-saturation constants and inhibition \n\nconstants help defining the sequential use of EA\u2019s. \n\nAfter calibration of the numerical model, a second model has been built by assigning the \n\nsame initial concentration of biomass for all microbial groups considered (Alternative case \n\nin Table 2.4). This exercise has been done in order to assess the influence of the \n\nuncertainty related to the initial concentration of each microbial group and the non-\n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n51 \n\nuniqueness of the numerical solution related to the uncertainty on the Monod parameters \n\nwhich has been reported by others (Schirmer et al., 1999). The initial concentration of \n\neach microbial group in an unknown of the jar-fermentor experiment, but it is a variable \n\nthat can be assessed in future experiments. On the other hand, the half saturation and \n\ninhibition constants, and maximum growth rates that describe the activity of each \n\nmicrobial group represent variables which are much more complicated to measure and, in \n\naddition. The influence of the uncertainty related to the Monod parameters will be \n\ndiscussed in section 2.5.2. \n\nBy fixing an initial concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\n-8\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n of biomass for each microbial group \n\nsome difficulties have arisen when searching for the best fit between measured and \n\nsimulated data. These results reveal that most probably, at time zero, the initial \n\nconcentration of each microbial group in the jar-fermentor is already being influenced by \n\nthe geochemical reactions taking place and therefore, the initial dimension of microbial \n\npopulations is not the same for each microbial group. Further discussion of the results \n\nattained in the alternative case is presented in section 2.5.2. \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nT\na\nb\n\nle\n 2\n\n.4\n \u2013\n\n S\nu\n\nm\nm\n\na\nry\n\n o\nf th\n\ne\n

\n\n2.5 Discussion \n\n2.5.1 Processes \n\nSince most probably the initial dimension of microbial populations is different for each \n\nmicrobial group, the interpretation of model results and subsequent analyses of the \n\nprocesses influencing such results are based on the reference case where the initial \n\ndimension of biomass is different for each microbial group. \n\n \n\n2.5.1.1 Reduction of DO and NO3\n-\n \n\nIn the reference model a very good agreement between measured and simulated data for \n\nDO and NO3\n-\n has been achieved. \n\nIn Figure 2.5a, the maximum of aerobic bacteria population coincides with the rapid \n\nconsumption of dissolved oxygen, reflecting the dependence of the net growth rate of \n\naerobic bacteria on the availability of dissolved oxygen. When dissolved oxygen is \n\nexhausted the population of aerobic bacteria quickly decays which reflects the influence of \n\nthe half-saturation constant for dissolved oxygen present in the extended Monod equation \n\nthat describes the rate of lactate oxidation by aerobes. Similarly, the rapid decrease of \n\nnitrate concentration (Figure 2.5b) coincides with the rapid increase of denitrifying \n\nbacteria, and when nitrate is exhausted, denitrifying bacteria population progressively \n\ndecays. \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nD\n.O\n\n. \n(m\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n[A\ne\n\nro\nb\n\ne\ns\n] \n(?\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\n       (b) \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0.000\n\n0.004\n\n0.008\n\n0.012\n\n0.016\n\n0.020\n\n[N\nO\n\n3\n- ] \n\n(m\nm\n\no\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n[D\ne\n\nn\nit\nri\n\nfi\ne\n\nrs\n] \n(?\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \nD.O. measured            D.O. simulated\nAerobes        \n\nNO\n3\n- measured            NO\n\n3\n- simulated\n\nDenitrifiers  \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Measured (symbols) and simulated (red line) time evolution of DO (a) and NO3\n-\n \n\n(b).

It has been seen, in Figure 2.5, that the reduction of DO and NO3\n-\n (that \n\nuse lactate as ED) is well reproduced by the model, and these species are reduced in 6 \n\nand 12 hours, respectively. Looking at Figure 2.6, one may see that the reduction of DO \n\nand NO3\n-\n has negligible influence on the concentration of lactate. In addition, the evolution \n\nof fermentative bacteria population (shown in Figure 2.6a) with a growth trend that is \n\napproximately symmetric to the trend of lactate consumption (until ~75 hours), reflects the \n\ndominating role of these bacteria on lactate concentration. Finally, when lactate is \n\nexhausted, the population of fermentative bacteria progressively decays. \n\nAs mentioned in section 2.3, lactate fermentation leads to the production of acetate and \n\npropionate. The numerical model reproduces very well the evolution of fermentation \n\nproducts, except for propionate which is over predicted (Figure 2.6b). Numerical results \n\nfollow approximately the observed evolution of propionate, but at computed values that \n\nare ~1.6 times measured data. The reason why propionate concentration is over predicted \n\nis most probably due to model stoichiometry or other propionate-consuming processes \n\nthat have not been considered in the numerical model. This subject will be further \n\ndiscussed in section 2.5.1.6.  \n\nAccording to the reaction for lactate fermentation proposed by von Gunten and Zobrist \n\n(1993), the stoichiometry of the kinetic reaction of lactate fermentation, without \n\nconsidering the build up of new biomass, is: \n\n \n\n)(2)()(3\n253232353\n\naqOHCaqOHCaqOHC\n???\n\n??                             (equation 2.10) \n\n \n\nIn equation 2.10, three moles of lactate are diverted into one mole of acetate and 2 moles \n\nof propionate. When build up of biomass of fermentative bacteria (with a specific yield of \n\n0.001, Table 2.4) is considered, the following equation is attained: \n\n \n\n \n)(976.0)(013.0)(995.0\n\n)(001.0)(2)()(001.0)(3\n\n23\n\n2752532324353\n\naqHlOHaqHCO\n\nsNOHCaqOHCaqOHCaqNHaqOHC\n\n??\n\n????\n\n???\n\n?????\n        \n\n(equation 2.11) \n\n \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n55 \n\nIn equation 2.11, besides the stoichiometry of lactate fermentation described by equation \n\n2.10, the build up of fermentative bacteria biomass is also expressed. This reaction affects \n\nboth pe and pH. pe is affected due to the oxidation of 0.995 moles of C(0) from lactate to \n\n0.995 moles of C(IV) from HCO3\n-\n, while pH is affected due to production of 0.976 moles of \n\nH\n+\n per each mole of reaction 2.11. In fact it will be shown in sections 2.5.1.4 and 2.5.1.5 \n\nthat, when the highest rate of lactate fermentation takes place (approximately between 40 \n\nand 75 hours, Figure 2.6A), important changes are computed (and also measured) for pe \n\nand pH. \n\nAcetate evolution (Figure 2.6c) is initially influenced by lactate fermentation which leads to \n\nthe increase of acetate concentration until 70 hours. Afterwards, when lactate is \n\nexhausted, acetate production is provided by sulphate reduction, according to the reaction \n\nproposed by von Gunten and Zobrist (1993). Finally, at approximately 175 hours acetate \n\nconcentration is kept more or less stable due to balancing between sulphate reduction \n\nand consumption of acetate by methanogens. \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n[L\na\n\nc\nta\n\nte\n] \n(m\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n[F\ne\n\nrm\ne\n\nn\nte\n\nrs\n] \n(?\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \nLac. measured            Lac. simulated\nFermenters  \n\n            (b) \n\n \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n[P\nro\n\np\nio\n\nn\na\n\nte\n] \n(m\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\n                 Pro. measured            Pro. simulated \n\n(c) \n\n \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n[A\nc\ne\n\nta\nte\n\n] \n(m\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n[M\ne\n\nth\na\n\nn\no\n\ng\ne\n\nn\ns\n] \n(?\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \nAce. measured            Ace. simulated\nMethanogens  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Time evolution of measured (symbols) and simulated (red line) dissolved \n\nlactate, acetate and propionate concentrations.

The first is provided by the activity of IRB\u2019s and the second is triggered by the \n\nincrease of HS\n-\n concentration. Biotic reduction of FeOOH is accompanied by oxidation of \n\npropionate while abiotic reduction of FeOOH is accompanied by oxidation of S(-II) to S(0) \n\nand subsequent precipitation of S\n0\n as follows (Pyzik and Sommer, 1981): \n\n \n\n)(3)(2)()()(2)(\n0\n\n2\naqOHaqFeOHsSaqHSsFeOOHlOH\n\n???\n?????                        \n\n(equation 2.12) \n\n \n\nBesides S\n0\n, precipitation of FeS and FeCO3 are also considered. FeS precipitation is \n\nsupported by observations during the jar-fermentor experiment as mentioned in section \n\n2.3.1, while precipitation of FeCO3 is expected due to the increase of Fe(II) concentration \n\nand the partial pressure of CO2 during the experiment. \n\nThe evolution of Fe(II) in solution (Figure 2.7a) reflects the combined effect of several \n\nprocesses. Until the first 10 hours, the FeOOH/Fe(II) system is relatively stable. From 10 \n\nto 100 hours an important increase of Fe(II) is computed (and measured). Then, from 100 \n\nto 160 hours, a relatively stable concentration of Fe(II) is computed and, during the final \n\npart of the experiment, a new increase is predicted. \n\nThe first increase in Fe(II) concentration is mainly due to the activity of IRB\u2019s, since abiotic \n\nreductive dissolution of FeOOH depends on the presence of HS\n-\n(aq) which only becomes \n\nimportant after SO4\n2-\n reduction by SRB\u2019s, from approximately 150 hours (Figure 2.7b). The \n\nsecond increase of Fe(II) in solution, with a lower slope than the first increase, is attributed \n\nto both biotic and abiotic reductive dissolution of FeOOH, since HS\n-\n is now available, \n\ncombined with the precipitation of FeS and FeCO3 which tend to decrease Fe(II)(aq) \n\nconcentration (Figure 2.7c). \n\nBetween 115 and 160 hours, a small deceasing tendency followed by a plateau is \n\nsimulated for the evolution of Fe(II) which is attributed to a temporary lag when \n\nprecipitation of Fe(II) phases become important and reductive dissolution of FeOOH is still \n\nsmall to compensate the removal of Fe(II) from solution due to the precipitation of the \n\nFe(II) secondary phases (Figure 2.7a and c). \n\nAs already mentioned, HS\n-\n may be a species of concern with respect to the chemical \n\nintegrity of a HLNW repository, since metallic canisters may be corroded by this species. \n\n\n\nII.

Computed concentration of calcite during the \n\nexperiment is also shown (blue line). \n\n \n\npH measured during the jar-fermentor experiment shows two trends. The first trend (from \n\nthe beginning of the experiment until approximately 75 hours) shows a gradual decrease \n\nfrom 8.0 to 6.7 pH units. In the second trend, the pH is stabilized at a pH value around 7.0 \n\nuntil the end of the simulation. \n\nSimilarly to measured pH, simulated pH also shows a more or less stable circum-neutral \n\nvalue from approximately 75 hours until the end of the experiment. Nevertheless, at the \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n59 \n\nbeginning and end of the experiment pH is overestimated with respect to measured \n\nvalues. \n\nIn the pH range measured during the experiment, and if pH and the carbon system would \n\nbe controlled by calcite equilibrium, the following reversible reactions would be \n\nresponsible for such control: \n\n \n\n)()()()(\n322\n\naqHaqHCOlOHgCO\n??\n\n???

(equation 2.14) \n\n \n\nLooking at equations 2.13 and 2.14, if the P(CO2) increases HCO3\n-\n is produced and at the \n\nsame time pH decreases (due to the released H\n+\n) which triggers calcite dissolution. \n\nCalcite dissolution, in turn, produces more HCO3\n-\n and buffers pH. From 75 hours until the \n\nend of the experiment, although calcite is predicted to precipitate, the simulated (and \n\nmeasured, at least until 100 hours) partial pressure of CO2 decreases. This apparently \n\ncontradictory relation between simulated calcite and CO2 evolution could be explained by \n\nother carbon consuming process that hinders the increase of P(CO2), such as \n\nmethanogenesis. Nevertheless, an alternative simulation has been performed without the \n\nformation of methane, but the partial pressure of CO2 is still underestimated. Another \n\nreason for the discrepancy between measured and simulated CO2 could be due to the fact \n\nthat calcite is modelled under local equilibrium, and instead calcite could be controlled by \n\nkinetics. This hypothesis has also been tested in an alternative numerical model, by using \n\nthe rate expression defined by Plummer et al. (1978) for the kinetic \n\nprecipitation/dissolution of calcite. Nevertheless, very similar results have been attained \n\ncompared to the simulation where calcite is treated under local equilibrium. \n\nThe differences between measured and simulated partial pressure of CO2 are still not well \n\nunderstood, but could be due to one or more of the following factors (or even others that \n\nhave not been identified yet): (1) overestimation of propionate production in lactate \n\nfermentation which leads to less available C(IV) in solution; (2) other propionate degrading \n\nprocesses could be present that would lead to more available C(IV); or (3) overestimation \n\nof abiotic methanogenesis. Abiotic methanogenesis (modelled under local equilibrium) \n\nleads to an excess of methane in the headspace gas (as will be shown in the next \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n60 \n\nsection), compared to measured data, which leads to a predominance of C(-IV) against \n\nC(IV), in the final stages of the simulation. \n\n \n\n2.5.1.5 Methanogenesis \n\nKinetic reduction of acetate to CH4 is considered to be mediated by methanogens. As \n\npreviously mentioned, since we are following the partial equilibrium approach, the local \n\nequilibrium reaction between C(IV) and C(-IV) (equation 2.1) has not been removed from \n\nthe thermodynamic database, and therefore, abiotic methanogenesis is predicted \n\nwhenever the redox potential is favourable for such reaction.  \n\nNumerical results show a considerable overestimation of CH4(g) with respect to measured \n\nvalues (Figure 2.9). In fact, even if the biological activity of methanogens is not included in \n\nthe numerical model, computed CH4(g) is already produced abiotically (results not shown). \n\nConsideration of this microbial group has very low effect on the total CH4 produced. On \n\nthe other hand, if equation 2.1 is not included in the thermodynamic database, simulated \n\npe is higher than the values measured during the last stage of the experiment. \n\nThe results attained in the experiment point towards the hypothesis of fully kinetic \n\nproduction of CH4 from HCO3\n-\n, instead of the partial equilibrium approach applied here. \n\nBut this consideration is not compatible with the partial equilibrium approach (where \n\nchanges on the oxidation state of inorganic species are modelled under local equilibrium) \n\nthat has been adopted in the present work, and for this reason the model fails to \n\nreproduce experimental data for methane and carbon dioxide. \n\n \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0.000\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\nM\ne\n\na\ns\nu\n\nre\nd\n\n P\n(C\n\nH\n4\n)\n\nS\nim\n\nu\nla\n\nte\nd\n\n P\n(C\n\nH\n4\n) \n\nx\n 0\n\n.1\n\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n[M\ne\n\nth\na\n\nn\no\n\ng\ne\n\nn\ns\n] \n(?\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \nCH\n\n4\n measured            CH\n\n4\n simulated\n\nMethanogens  \n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Time evolution of measured (symbols) and simulated (red line) partial pressure \n\nof CH4(g) in the headspace.

The rapid decrease of measured pe until the first 15 hours reflects the \n\nreduction of O2 and NO3\n-\n which is well reproduced by the model. The preceding temporal \n\npe increase could be due to lactate fermentation, since this process is believed to follow \n\nO2 and NO3\n-\n reduction, and it produces oxidized carbon without reducing any inorganic \n\nEA, as expressed by equation 2.11. \n\n \n\n \n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\np\ne\n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n[b\nio\n\nm\na\n\ns\ns\n] \n\n(?\nm\n\no\nl\u00b7\nL\n\n-1\n)\n\n[M\ne\n\nth\na\n\nn\no\n\ng\ne\n\nn\ns\n] \n\nx\n 1\n\n0\n0\n\n (\n?\n\nm\no\nl\u00b7\nL\n\n-1\n)\n\nLegend:\n\npe measured            pe simulated\n\nAerobes            Denitrifiers            Fermenters\n\nIRB                   SRB                      Methanogens  \n\nFigure 2.10 \u2013 Time evolution of measured (symbols) and simulated (red line) pe.

These computed results support the hypothesis for pe \n\nbeing controlled by the biological activity of this group when they are close to their \n\nmaximum. Then, at approximately 115 hours, the rapid drop of computed pe to \n\napproximately -4 seems to reflect the relative importance of abiotic methanogenesis. \n\nThe simulated pe plateau around 2, most probably motivated by lactate fermentation, lasts \n\nlonger than measured temporal pe increase (from 15 to 50 hours). Nevertheless, lactate \n\nconsumption is well reproduced by the model, as observed in section 2.5.1.2.  \n\nSince measured evolution of almost all the inorganic EA\u2019s (exception made for HCO3\n-\n in \n\nmethanogenesis) is well reproduced by the numerical model, the discrepancies observed \n\nbetween measured and simulated pe could be due to the stoichiometry of lactate \n\nfermentation implemented which has resulted in an overestimation of propionate (section \n\n2.5.1.2). In fact, if we consider an alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation, in \n\nsuch a way that computed propionate does not overestimate measured propionate, \n\ncomputed pe matches better observed values, as shown in Figure 2.11. \n\n \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime (hours)\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\np\ne\n\npe measured            pe simulated\n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 \u2013 Time evolution of measured (symbols) and simulated (red line) pe considering \n\nan alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n63 \n\nThe alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation that leads to a better agreement \n\nbetween observed and measured pe (and also propionate, data not shown) is as follows: \n\n \n\n3 mole of lactate ? 1 mole of acetate + 1.3 moles of propionate                                \n\n(equation 2.17) \n\n \n\nIn equation 2.17, the build up of new biomass of fermentative bacteria is not shown, for \n\nsimplicity. In contrast to what is shown in equation 2.17, the stoichiometry used in the \n\ncalibrated case that has been implemented in other works (von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993 \n\nand Sch\u00e4fer et al., 1998), is: \n\n \n\n3 mole of lactate ? 1 mole of acetate + 2 moles of propionate                                   \n\n(equation 2.18) \n\n \n\nWith the alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation (equation 2.17), the small \n\nplateau computed for pe coincides with the temporal increase of measured pe (Figure \n\n2.11). Nevertheless, this alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation triggers the \n\nanticipation of reduction of SO4\n2-\n. Therefore, for the objective of this study we rely on the \n\nreference case which results have been discussed in the former sections.  \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Uncertainties on Monod parameters \n\nDuring parameterization of the extended Monod kinetic expressions applied for each \n\nmicrobial group considered in the numerical model, different combinations of the \n\nparameters have been found to lead to the same numerical solution. These results point \n\ntowards non-uniqueness of the numerical solution which has also been identified by \n\nothers (Schirmer et al., 1999). In this context, an alternative combination of Monod kinetic \n\nparameters has been applied by fixing an initial concentration of biomass of 1 \u00d7 10\n-8\n \n\nmol\u00b7L\n-1\n for all microbial groups. The values of the Monod kinetic parameters applied in this \n\nalternative case are listed in Table 2.2. \n\nIn Figure 2.12, the main results of the alternative case are shown. As for the reference \n\ncase, in the alternative case, measured time evolution of pH, DO, NO3\n-\n, lactate, acetate \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n64 \n\nand SO4\n2-\n\n is very well reproduced by the numerical model. And, as observed for the \n\nreference case, propionate is overestimated in the alternative case. \n\nComputed calcite concentration shows a more abrupt evolution than the one computed in \n\nthe calibrated case. In addition, between 75 and 115 hours, the alternative case computes \n\nan exhaustion of calcite (zero moles of this mineral). These results reflect the influence of \n\nthe new combination of the Monod parameters that, in general, leads to a more abrupt \n\ncomputed evolution of the biomass of the different microbial groups considered which, \n\nconsequently, induce more abrupt curves for the EA\u2019s and ED\u2019s involved. \n\nFe(II) evolution does not fit so well in the alternative case (Figure 2.12e) as in the \n\ncalibrated case (Figure 2.7b). This could be due to the fact that in the alternative case \n\nIRB\u2019s population is very small at the beginning of the simulation (mainly due to the \n\nimposed initial concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\n-8\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n), and therefore computed Fe(II) is \n\nunderestimated for the initial stage of the experiment. \n\nComputed maximum of each microbial group in the alternative case also differs from the \n\nreference case. These differences are motivated by the different values of the Monod \n\nparameters. Maximum of aerobic bacteria in the alternative case is approximately the \n\ndouble of the maximum reached in the calibrated case, while the maximum of denitrifying \n\nbacteria in the alternative case is much smaller that in the reference case. Maxima of \n\nfermentative bacteria, IRB\u2019s and SRB\u2019s are smaller in the alternative case than in the \n\nreference case. The different partitioning of carbon between biomass and the inorganic \n\ncarbon system observed in the two cases under study, has obviously an important \n\ninfluence on the computed results for the inorganic carbon system. Additional data must \n\nbe measured in further experiments, such as calcium concentration and the initial \n\nconcentration of microbial groups, in order to minimise the uncertainties associated to the \n\nexperimental initial conditions and evolution, and thus, maintaining the uncertainties \n\nassociated solely to the parameters describing the kinetic rates in the Monod growth \n\nmodel. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nII.

Some \n\ndiscrepancies between modelled and measured data are still unsolved. Future \n\nexperiments with additional data measurements and a sensitivity analysis of the Monod \n\nparameters may help solving some of these problems. \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n \n\n66 \n\nThe calibration of the numerical model helped improving the understanding of the \n\nprocesses that influence pH and the redox potential of the jar-fermentor experiment. \n\nUndoubtedly, microbial activity exerts a great influence on pH, pe and associated \n\ncomposition of mineral and gas phases, within an aquatic system where organic matter is \n\navailable. The results attained show that if microbes and organic matter are present in the \n\nvicinity of a deep geological repository, microbial redox reactions may provide a relatively \n\nfast evolution towards reducing conditions that are favourable to the geochemical integrity \n\nof the repository. If HS\n-\n is produced during the sequence of microbial redox reactions, its \n\nconcentration can be controlled by the precipitation of sulphur secondary phases such as \n\nS(0) and FeS which were predicted by the numerical simulation developed here. In this \n\ncontext, precipitation of sulphur secondary minerals may contribute to the mitigation of \n\ncorrosion of the copper canisters within a deep geological repository. \n\nBy applying the partial equilibrium approach in PHREEQC a reliable estimation of the \n\nindirect parameters pH and pe has been achieved. Measured evolution of the inorganic \n\nEA\u2019s (DO, NO3\n-\n and SO4\n\n2-\n) and Fe(II) is very well reproduced by the numerical model. \n\nSimulated lactate fermentation and methanogenesis have shown some discrepancies with \n\nrespect to measured data. \n\nFermentative bacteria seem to be the dominant microbial group during most of the \n\nexperiment, and therefore, the inorganic system is highly influenced by the biological \n\nactivity of this group. The temporal pe plateau around 2 seems to be controlled by the \n\nactivity of fermenters, as well as the first and fastest increase of the partial pressure of \n\nCO2 in the headspace gas which triggers calcite dissolution. The jar-fermentor experiment \n\nand the numerical simulations developed here have provided an improved understanding \n\nof aquatic systems influenced by microbial activity. In order to assess the influence of \n\nsuch microbial activity in the repository system new numerical simulations that account for \n\nits geochemical and hydrodynamic features should be developed.  \n\nThe stoichiometry of lactate fermentation may be different (3 mol Lactate ? 1 mol Acetate \n\n+ 1.3 mol Propionate) from the one implemented in the reference case (3 mol Lactate ? 1 \n\nmol Acetate + 2 mol Propionate), that has been implemented by others (Sch\u00e4fer et al., \n\n1998). \n\nMethane production is overestimated with respect to measured data which seems to \n\nindicate solely kinetic processes controlling CH4 production rather then both local \n\nequilibrium and biotic kinetic processes as implemented here. \n\n\n\nII. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments \n\n67 \n\nSome uncertainties related to the Monod parameters could be solved in future \n\nexperiments if additional variables are measured, such as aqueous calcium and \n\ncarbonate minerals concentration, and the initial and final concentration of microbial \n\ngroups. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis study was performed as a part of the \u201cProject for Assessment Methodology \n\nDevelopment of Chemical Effects on Geological Disposal System\u201d funded by the Ministry \n\nof Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan.

Quantitative assessment of radionuclide \n\nretention in glacial clays related to \n\ngroundwater discharge areas3 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) has recently \n\nselected Forsmark for sitting a deep geological repository for high level nuclear waste \n\n(HLNW). At the surface, a Quaternary till overlies the granitic candidate host rock. \n\nRadionuclides potentially released from a repository may reach surface ecosystems if \n\nthese are somehow related to deep groundwater discharge areas. At Forsmark, surface \n\nwater bodies are partially fed by shallow aquifers which locally receive deep groundwater \n\ndischarge. At the bottom of surface water bodies and overlying the Quaternary till, glacial \n\nclays are present. Reactive transport numerical simulations have been performed to \n\nevaluate the retention of radionuclides, potentially released from a repository, in the \n\nglacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas. Four radionuclides (\n235\n\nU, \n135\n\nCs, \n\n226\nRa and \n\n90\nSr) have been selected according to their different geochemical behaviour and \n\npotential dose relevance to surface ecosystems. Numerical results indicate that U \n\nprecipitates as amorphous uraninite in the glacial clay; Sr co-precipitates with calcite and \n\nit is also adsorbed on illite. Cs is also retained by adsorption on illite. Ra is mobile, since \n\nco-precipitation with barite, the only mechanism considered to retain Ra, is not predicted \n\nby the numerical calculations. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Glacial clay, Groundwater discharge area, Radionuclides, Reactive solute \n\ntransport, PHAST \n\n                                                \n\n3\n This work has been accepted in Hydrogeology Journal, and has been developed by the following \n\nco-authors: Clara Sena\na,b\n\n, Fidel Grandia\na\n, David Arcos\n\na\n, Jorge Molinero\n\na\n, Lara Duro\n\na\n and Jordi \n\nBruno\na\n \n\na\nAmphos XXI Consulting S.L., Spain; \n\nb\nI&amp;D GeoBioTec, University of Aveiro, Portugal \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n72 \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nOn June 2009, SKB has decided to select Forsmark as the site for the final repository for \n\nSweden\u2019s HLNW. The selection of Forsmark is the result of close to 20 years of work \n\nduring which SKB has conducted surveys throughout Sweden and feasibility studies in \n\neight municipalities. These were followed by site investigations in two alternative sites: \n\nForsmark and Oskarshamn between 2002 and 2007 (SKB, 2009). The deep geological \n\nrepository is designed with a number of engineered (copper canisters, clay barriers, \n\ncement liners) and natural geological barriers to prevent and retard for long periods of \n\ntime (~100,000 years) the potential migration of radionuclides to the surface (SKB, 2006). \n\nAs reported by Berglund et al. (2009), flow path analysis is required in the context of \n\nsafety assessment to identify discharge areas where radionuclides potentially released \n\nfrom a repository could reach the surface ecosystems. At Forsmark, the near-surface \n\nQuaternary sediments would constitute the last geological barrier preventing the arrival of \n\nradionuclides to the surface biosphere. For this reason, SKB has launched a \n\ncomprehensive research programme for the near-surface hydro-geo-ecological study of \n\nthe candidate sites. The main scientific results of such programme have been recently \n\npublished in Berglund et al. (2009). \n\nQuantitative analysis of radionuclide migration and the evaluation of the retention capacity \n\nof Quaternary sediments is part of the safety assessment of the repository. Coupled \n\ngroundwater flow and reactive solute transport models provide a useful tool for such \n\nquantitative understanding of radionuclide migration through the Quaternary sediments \n\nconnecting deep groundwater flow paths to surface discharge areas. \n\nIn the last years, reactive transport models have been applied to a wide variety of \n\nenvironmental issues some of which include characterization of landfill plumes (Brun et \n\nal., 2002), cation exchange models to describe caesium sorption at high ionic strength in \n\nsubsurface sediments contaminated by HLNW (Liu et al., 2004), large-scale and long-\n\nterm reactive transport simulations to validate hydrochemical and hydrogeological \n\nconceptual models (Molinero and Samper, 2006), simulation of laboratory experiments \n\n(Steefel et al., 2003) and assessment of the geochemical evolution of a deep geological \n\nrepository (Arcos et al., 2008). \n\nThe work presented here focuses on the hydrogeochemical processes that influence \n\nradionuclide migration in the Quaternary sediments present at the groundwater discharge \n\nareas in one of the candidate sites (Forsmark). \n\n\n\nIII. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n73 \n\nCoupled groundwater flow and reactive solute transport numerical simulations have been \n\nperformed to assess the retention of selected radionuclides in glacial clays present at the \n\nbottom of surface water bodies related to groundwater discharge areas. Four \n\nradionuclides (\n235\n\nU, \n135\n\nCs, \n226\n\nRa and \n90\n\nSr) have been selected to be studied, according to \n\ntheir different geochemical behaviour and potential dose relevance to surface \n\necosystems.  \n\n \n\n3.2 Scope \n\nA modelling procedure to assess radionuclide retention in near-surface systems is \n\ndescribed in the present work. This modelling procedures relies on six main steps: (1) a \n\nthorough review of site specific data that describe the hydrogeochemical behaviour of the \n\nsystem under study; (2) development of the conceptual model of the system based on \n\ndata gathered in the first step; (3) identification and quantification of the thermodynamic \n\nparameters that describe the geochemical processes of interest; (4) implementation of the \n\nconceptual model in reactive transport numerical simulations; (5) simulation of a \n\nhypothetical repository release in the numerical model; and, (6) quantitative assessment \n\nof radionuclide retention in the modelled system based on the outputs of the numerical \n\nsimulations. \n\nSite specific data on hydraulic, hydrochemical and geochemical parameters of the glacial \n\nclays at Forsmark have been thoroughly analysed from the SKB database of the \n\nForsmark Site Characterization Programme (SKB, 2005). The glacial clay conceptual \n\nmodel was then implemented in a reactive transport numerical model. By simulating a \n\nlong period of coupled groundwater flow and reactive solute transport with the average \n\nconcentrations of the main reactive minerals, major and minor ions, and natural isotopes \n\nof the studied radionuclides, the geochemical quasi-steady state of the glacial clays has \n\nbeen modelled and reproduces the present-day conditions observed at the groundwater \n\ndischarge areas of Forsmark. Once the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions of the \n\nglacial clays at Forsmark have been modelled, a hypothetical repository release was \n\nsimulated by injecting a deep groundwater carrying repository-derived radionuclides into \n\nthe modelled domain. The simulation of repository release was performed for an \n\nadditional long period of reactive solute transport. From the outputs of the numerical \n\nsimulations, the radionuclide retention capacity of the glacial clays present at the bottom \n\nof surface water bodies has been quantitatively assessed. \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n74 \n\n3.3 Near-surface hydrogeology at Forsmark \n\nThe near-surface hydrogeology at Forsmark is composed of Quaternary deposits that host \n\nconfined and unconfined aquifers overlying the granitic bedrock. Groundwater in the \n\ngranitic bedrock flows mainly along fractures and deformation zones composed of loose \n\ngranitic material and coatings of calcite, chlorite, quartz and pyrite (Drake et al., 2006). \n\nThe till deposit which is the most abundant Quaternary deposit (~75% of aerial extension, \n\nFigure 3.1) hosts unconfined porous aquifers with stratified hydraulic conductivity and \n\nporosity (Johansson et al., 2005). The thickness of the Quaternary deposits is highly \n\nvariable, usually from 0 to 3 m, although in some places it can reach over 10 m \n\n(Johansson et al., 2005). \n\nIn general, the till deposit consists of sandy glacial deposits with variable amounts of \n\nboulders and clay (Albrecht, 2005). The origin of this till is associated with the glacial \n\nerosion, transport and deposition of Palaeozoic carbonate rocks located northwards from \n\nForsmark (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006), and therefore carbonate minerals are \n\nabundant in the Quaternary deposits. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Geological map of the Forsmark area with location of the candidate site (SKB, \n\n2002, reproduced with permission). \n\n \n\nAt the bottom of surface water bodies such as streams, lakes or the Baltic Sea, and \n\noverlying the till deposit, glacial to post-glacial clays with organic matter-rich layers called \n\ngyttja are present. These are low permeability sediments basically composed of illite, \n\n\n\nIII. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n75 \n\ncalcite, organic detritus and minor amounts of pyrite (Lokrantz and Hedenstr\u00f6m, 2006; \n\nVikstr\u00f6m, 2005). \n\nIn general, groundwater flows in Quaternary deposits from elevated inland areas towards \n\nthe Baltic Sea, with local discharge into the water courses that feed lakes and wetlands \n\n(Johansson et al., 2005). Hydrogeological investigations reveal that hydraulic connections \n\nbetween Quaternary deposits and the granitic bedrock could be in a downward direction \n\n(Bosson and Berglund, 2006). Nevertheless, local upward flow paths, between bedrock \n\nand Quaternary deposits, are also believed to occur (Laaksoharju et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n3.4 Natural occurrence of uranium, strontium, caesium and \n\nradium at Forsmark \n\nThe concentrations of the natural isotopes of the selected radionuclides (uranium, \n\nstrontium, caesium and radium) at Forsmark have been studied. By comparing the \n\nconcentration of these elements (both in aqueous and solid phases) with major elements, \n\nkey geochemical processes that influence radionuclide mobility in the glacial clays may be \n\ndepicted. This is a fundamental step in the process of building a sound hydrogeochemical \n\nconceptual model of the problem of interest. \n\n \n\n3.4.1 Uranium \n\nIn shallow groundwaters of Forsmark, uranium concentrations range from 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-4\n to 1.5 \n\n\u00d7 10\n-1\n ?mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n. This wide range indicates variable redox conditions in the near-surface \n\nsystems. Lake and stream waters at Forsmark have similar uranium concentrations (4.09 \n\n\u00d7 10\n-3\n to 1.57 \u00d7 10\n\n-2\n ?mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n; Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006). Uranium is commonly \n\ntransported forming complexes with bicarbonate, phosphate, iron and dissolved organic \n\ncarbon (DOC) (Grenthe et al., 1992). However, none of these ions shows clear correlation \n\nwith uranium, suggesting that multiple geochemical processes are responsible for the \n\nmobility of uranium in these waters. The presence of calcite in most of the Quaternary \n\nsediments at Forsmark leads to the predominance of circum-neutral waters with \n\nconsiderable amounts of dissolved carbonates which, in turn, enhance the mobility of \n\nuranium in these near-surface waters. \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n76 \n\nFrom elemental analysis of the solid phase of the Quaternary deposits, rough correlations \n\nbetween uranium and iron, manganese and phosphorous are observed, indicating that \n\nuranium could be associated with Fe-Mn oxides or phosphates. \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Strontium \n\nStrontium concentrations in shallow groundwaters range between 0.8 to 50 ?mol\u00b7L\n-1\n\n. \n\nTaking into account the interaction between water and the till and knowing that both Ca \n\nand Sr may be present in carbonates and exchangeable sites of clay minerals, a \n\ncorrelation between strontium and calcium is expected. Indeed, looking in detail at the \n\nshallow groundwaters composition in the study area, two different trends are observed \n\nwhen strontium concentrations are plotted against Ca (Figure 3.2). \n\nOne trend involves high salinity waters (top right border of mixing trend, Figure 3.2), and \n\nrepresents a mixing trend. The other trend includes dilute waters, with a Sr/Ca (molar \n\nratio) of 10\n-4\n that is consistent with congruent dissolution of a Sr-bearing calcite in the solid \n\nphase. Bruno et al. (2002) obtained an average Sr/Ca (molar ratio) of 3.5 \u00d7 10\n-3\n in a set of \n\ngroundwaters from different environments. \n\n \n\n0.0E+000 8.0E-003 1.6E-002\n\n[Ca] (mol\u00b7L-1)\n\n0.0E+000\n\n1.0E-005\n\n2.0E-005\n\n3.0E-005\n\n4.0E-005\n\n5.0E-005\n\n[S\nr]\n\n (\nm\n\no\nl\u00b7\nL\n\n-1\n)\n\nmixing\ntrend\n\nr2= 0.990\n\n[Sr] = 3.2E-03[Ca] - 6.4E-07\n\nr2= 0.972\n\n[Sr] = 6.8E-04[Ca] + 3.0E-08\n\ndilute waters\n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Observed correlations between strontium and calcium in shallow groundwaters \n\nof Forsmark candidate area. \n\n \n\n\n\nIII. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n77 \n\n3.4.3 Caesium \n\nData on caesium concentrations are scarce in shallow groundwaters in the Forsmark \n\narea. Data on shallow groundwaters ranges from 5\u00d710\n\u20135\n\n to 1\u00d710\n\u20133\n\n ?mol\u00b7L\n-1\n which reveals \n\nrelatively low concentrations of caesium in natural waters. With the available data no clear \n\ncorrelations with other ions have been observed. Nevertheless, caesium is expected to be \n\ninvolved in cation exchange in interlayered clays like illite (Bradbury and Baeyens, 2000, \n\namong others). \n\n \n\n3.4.4 Radium \n\nRadium concentration in natural waters is usually very low, ranging from 10\n-8\n to 10\n\n-5\n \n\n?mol\u00b7L\n-1\n. Among the 22 shallow groundwater samples collected in Forsmark for radium \n\nanalysis (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006) five were below detection limit for radium (1 \u00d7 \n\n10\n-8\n ?mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n), and the maximum radium concentration reached was 1.09 \u00d7 10\n\n-7\n ?mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n. \n\n \n\n3.5 Reactive solute transport modelling \n\nThe numerical simulations developed in this work rely on a hypothetical scenario where a \n\nradionuclide-bearing deep groundwater flows upwards, from the repository to the surface, \n\nreaching a glacial clay sediment located at the bottom of a lake or the Baltic Sea (Figure \n\n3.3). Glacial clays do not contact directly with the top of the granite; instead, a till deposit \n\nis always present between both geological materials (Figure 3.3). In order to evaluate the \n\nhydrogeochemical processes that take place in a glacial clay and influence radionuclide \n\nmobility, deep groundwater is assumed to flow through a preferential path of the till \n\ndeposit (fracture) that contacts directly the bottom of the glacial clay layer. \n\nIt should be noted that the numerical model developed aims at depicting a realistic \n\nevolution of radionuclide mobility within the glacial clay at Forsmark and is based on site \n\nspecific data whenever possible, although it considers a hypothetical scenario. \n\nThe reactive solute transport simulations have been performed with the finite-difference \n\ncode PHAST v. 1.4.2 (Parkhurst et al., 2004). This code is the result of coupling a \n\ntransport solver, HST3D (Kipp, 1997) and the well known geochemical code, PHREEQC \n\n(Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). PHAST is able to simulate multi-component, reactive solute \n\ntransport in three-dimensional saturated groundwater flow systems. The reactive transport \n\nequations are solved by sequential non iterative approach (SNIA) in which solute transport \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n78 \n\nand chemical reaction are decoupled for each time step. Previous static geochemical \n\nsimulations were conducted to define proper and consistent initial and boundary \n\nconditions of the reactive solute transport simulations. \n\n \n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nE\nle\n\nv\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\n a\n\ns\nl)\n\n100 m100 m\n\nSurface water\n\nWetland Till\n\nPost-glacial clay\n\nGlacial clay\n\nBedrock\n\nFracture\n\nFracture zone\n\nLegend:\n\nGroundwater flow direction\n\nHypothetical path of a repository-derived radionuclide\n\nSurface water\n\nWetland Till\n\nPost-glacial clay\n\nGlacial clay\n\nBedrock\n\nFracture\n\nFracture zone\n\nLegend:\n\nGroundwater flow direction\n\nHypothetical path of a repository-derived radionuclide\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Near-surface hydrogeological conceptual model of Forsmark candidate site \n\n(modified from Johansson et al., 2005) showing a hypothetical path of radionuclides \n\nreleased from a repository.

Sorption and precipitation are \n\ncontrolled by the groundwater composition. In general, radionuclide retention is provided \n\nby (i) sorption on charged surfaces (mainly clays and oxyhydroxides); (ii) co-precipitation \n\nwith sulphates, sulphides, oxyhydroxides and carbonates; (iii) redox retention processes \n\nand (iv) sorption onto organic tissues. In some cases, precipitation of pure phases (e.g., \n\namorphous uraninite) can also be relevant despite the relatively low concentrations of \n\nthese radionuclides. Since the objective of this work is the quantitative assessment of \n\nradionuclide retention in glacial clay sediments, radioactive decay was not considered in \n\nthe numerical simulations. \n\nAccording to Hedenstr\u00f6m (2004), at Forsmark, the glacial clays present in the lake \n\nsediments and the Baltic Sea have considerable amounts of illite, quartz and calcite. \n\nQuartz and illite have very slow precipitation/dissolution kinetics under the pH and pe \n\nconditions that prevail in the glacial clays at Forsmark (K\u00f6hler et al., 2003). Therefore, \n\nfrom the observed minerals only calcite was included as a reactive solid phase in the \n\nnumerical simulations, and, given that no reactivity was considered for illite, this mineral \n\nwas simulated solely as a charged surface for cation exchange. \n\nFrom the four radionuclides selected, caesium and strontium are considered to exchange \n\nin illite sites. In the numerical simulations, the model for cation exchange in illite is that \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n80 \n\nproposed by Bradbury and Baeyens (2000) with some modifications (see Appendix 1, and \n\nGrandia et al., 2007 for further details). The proposed model considers three types of \n\nsites: planar sites, type II sites and frayed edge sites (FES). Divalent cations (Ca\n2+\n\n, Mg\n2+\n\n, \n\nSr\n2+\n\n) only exchange in the planar sites, while monovalent cations (Na\n+\n, K\n\n+\n, NH4\n\n+\n and Cs\n\n+\n) \n\nmay exchange in all the types of sites. Cs\n+\n is known to have high affinity for the FES \n\n(Bradbury and Baeyens, 2000, among others). Assuming a 50 wt% of illite in the glacial \n\nclays at Forsmark, with a cation exchange capacity of 0.2 eq\u00b7kgsolid\n-1\n, as reported by \n\nBradbury and Baeyens (2000), a constant concentration of 0.1 mol\u00b7kgsolid\n-1\n of total cation \n\nexchange sites in illite has been considered in the numerical simulations. \n\nAs mentioned above, calcite is present in the glacial clays and is likely to incorporate trace \n\namounts of strontium. Therefore, a non-ideal calcite-strontianite solid solution (Tesoriero \n\nand Pankow, 1996) has been considered to be present in the glacial clay. From the mean \n\nCaCO3 content of 26 wt% measured in the glacial clays at Forsmark (SKB 2005), and \n\nconsidering that only an external thin rim of the calcite grains (corresponding to 5% of total \n\ncalcite) is available to react with the porewater, an initial amount of 0.8 wt% of calcite-\n\nstrontianite solid solution (which corresponds to ~0.8 mol\u00b7Lwater\n-1\n) has been prescribed in \n\nthe numerical simulations. In addition, and since the studied groundwaters are rich in \n\naqueous carbonate, Fe(III) carbonate complexes have been added to the thermodynamic \n\ndatabase (Griv\u00e9, 2005). \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Complexation reactions of aqueous Fe(III) carbonates and corresponding \n\nthermodynamic constants (from Griv\u00e9, 2005). \n\nReaction Log K\n0\n (25\u00baC) \n\nFe\n3+\n\n + CO3\n2-\n\n + H2O?

Nevertheless, pyrite \n\nis known to form in lake sediments similar to the ones under study (Percival et al., 2001). \n\nIn addition, elemental concentrations of sulphur in the solid phase of lake sediments at \n\nForsmark can be up to 3.3 wt% (Hedenstr\u00f6m, 2004). Therefore, and taking into account \n\nthe predominant reducing conditions of the glacial clays at Forsmark, an initial \n\nconcentration of 1.2 wt% of pyrite (which corresponds to approximately 1 mol\u00b7Lwater\n-1\n of \n\npyrite) has been prescribed in the numerical model. \n\n\n\nIII. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n81 \n\nSiderite (FeCO3) is also not mentioned in data related to the mineralogy of glacial clays at \n\nForsmark. This mineral is redox sensitive and can precipitate in the glacial clay domain \n\nafter the inflow of a reducing and Fe-rich deep groundwater. Therefore, siderite is allowed \n\nto precipitate in the simulations if oversaturation with this mineral is reached. \n\nUranium occurs in nature mainly as two oxidation states: U(IV) and U(VI). The former is \n\nrather immobile so that reducing waters are not able to transport much uranium \n\n(Langmuir, 1997). Amorphous uraninite, a U(IV) solid phase, could form in a glacial clay \n\nsediment if repository-derived uranium interacts with potentially reducing porewaters. On \n\nthe other hand, if repository-derived uranium reaches oxidising conditions, its mobility \n\ncould be enhanced and soluble U(VI) hydroxide and particularly carbonate complexes \n\nmay form. \n\nIn shallow aquatic environments containing organic matter, U(VI) may be complexed by \n\norganic compounds and also reduced and immobilized as U(IV). The glacial clays at \n\nForsmark usually contain considerable concentrations of organic matter in which humic \n\nacids are most probably present; and therefore, U(VI) humic complexes have been added \n\nto the thermodynamic database used in the reactive transport simulations. The cations \n\nconsidered for complexation with humic acids are calcium and uranium. The reactions and \n\nthermodynamic constants for these species are listed in Table 3.3. \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 \u2013 Complexation reactions of organic compounds and the corresponding \n\nthermodynamic constants. \n\nReaction Log K (25\u00baC) \n\nCa\n2+\n\n + Humate\n-\n ?

In many aqueous systems, radium is quantitatively co-precipitated \n\nwith barium sulphate (barite, BaSO4) due to the chemical similarity between radium and \n\nbarium. In the numerical simulations, an ideal solid solution between BaSO4 and RaSO4 is \n\nlet to form if saturation with barite is reached. \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n82 \n\nAccording to the processes identified to occur in the glacial clays at Forsmark that may \n\ninfluence radionuclide mobility, the reactive minerals considered in the numerical \n\nsimulations are listed in Table 3.4. It should be noted that the saturation index of relevant \n\npure phases that may incorporate the studied radionuclides was calculated and monitored \n\nduring previous simulations. The monitored phases are becquerelite \n\n(Ca(UO2)6O4(OH)6:8H2O), schoepite (UO3\u00b7nH2O) and soddyite ((UO2)2SiO4\u00b72H2O) (for U); \n\ncelestite (SrSO4) and strontianite (SrCO3) (for Sr); and radium sulphate (RaSO4) (for Ra). \n\nSince saturation with these phases was not reached under the geochemical conditions \n\nmodelled, these minerals were discarded for further numerical calculations. \n\nIn Table A1.2 of Appendix 1, the dissolution reactions of the minerals considered in the \n\nnumerical simulations are listed. \n\n \n\nTable 3.4 \u2013 Initial concentration of the reactive minerals considered for the reactive \n\ntransport simulations.

Therefore, the flow conditions prescribed for the glacial clay depend \n\non the flow conditions in the surrounding till aquifer. In order to evaluate the flow directions \n\nthat occur in such a glacial clay layer and according to the hydrologic water balance \n\n\n\nIII. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n83 \n\ncalculations performed for the Forsmark site (Johansson et al. 2005), a preliminary \n\nnumerical model with a clay layer located at the right top corner of a till domain was built. \n\nIn this previous model a shallow groundwater inflow of 14.5 L\u00b7d\n-1\n at the left boundary, and \n\na deep groundwater inflow of 0.25 L\u00b7d\n-1\n was set. The numerical model of the glacial clay \n\nwas then built based on the flow directions and hydraulic heads attained in the preliminary \n\nnumerical model (Figure 3.4). \n\nThe modelled domain of the glacial clay is a 2D symmetric vertical cross section of a \n\nglacial clay that may be present at groundwater discharge areas of Forsmark (Figure 3.4). \n\nBased on the description of lake sediments (Johansson et al., 2005), the thickness of the \n\nglacial clay was set to 1 m. Shallow groundwater in equilibrium with the glacial clay \n\nmineralogy enters the modelled domain through the left and bottom boundaries. Deep \n\ngroundwater enters the modelled domain at the bottom right corner (Figure 3.4). The \n\nwater flowing in this domain flows out through the whole top boundary. \n\n \n\n10 m\n\n1 m\n\nConstant head (outflow)\n\nConstant head (deep \n\ngroundwater)\n\nConstant head (clay porewater)\n\nImpervious boundary\n\nExpected flow direction\n\nLegend:\n\nTill ground\n\nwater\n\nGlacial clay\n\nDeep \n\ngroundwater\n\nDischarge\n\narea\n\nPreliminary model\n\n(to find boundary \n\nconditions of glacial \n\nclay)\n\nModelled domain\n\nDeep \n\ngroundwater\n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Preliminary model developed to find the boundary conditions of the glacial clay, \n\nand modelled domain developed for the glacial clay sediment with the corresponding \n\nboundary conditions.  \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n84 \n\nThe reactive transport model built in this work simulates aqueous speciation and \n\ngeochemical reactions between solid and aqueous phases all under local equilibrium. To \n\ncompute the initial state of a reactive transport model the code used firstly equilibrates the \n\ninitial porewater with the reactive minerals considered. Therefore, and in order to critically \n\nanalyse the output of the initial equilibration, we have performed previous static \n\ncalculations in PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) to define the initial porewater and \n\nboundary waters equilibrated with the minerals most likely to control the composition of \n\nthese waters that have been identified in the previous section. \n\nAccording to the main reactive minerals defined for the modelled domain, the composition \n\nof the glacial clay porewater has been obtained after equilibration of a selected sample of \n\nlake sediments porewater at Forsmark, with calcite, siderite and pyrite (Table 3.5). As this \n\nporewater is already close to the equilibrium with these minerals, the resulting \n\ncomposition is very similar to the sampled water. The redox state of the solution is \n\ncontrolled by the Fe(III)/pyrite pair. \n\nThe composition of the deep groundwater prior to repository release was set by \n\nequilibrating a selected deep groundwater sample from Forsmark with calcite and pyrite. \n\nThis equilibration does not change much the original deep groundwater composition, \n\nsince this water sample is close to the equilibrium with the selected phases. The \n\ncomposition of deep groundwater affected by repository release is modified by adding \n\nrepository-derived radionuclides (\nRD\n\nSr, \nRD\n\nCs, \nRD\n\nU and Ra, Table 3.5). In order to \n\ndistinguish repository-derived radionuclides from those of natural origin, already present in \n\nthe glacial clay porewater at Forsmark, radionuclides coming from repository were \n\nlabelled as \nRD\n\nCs, \nRD\n\nSr, and \nRD\n\nU in the model (RD stands for Repository-Derived).

The \n\nhydrochemistry and geochemistry of the glacial clay are expected to vary due to the inflow \n\nof a deep groundwater with different composition than the clay porewater. \n\nThe characterization programme for Forsmark candidate site has identified discharge \n\nareas related to surface water bodies where mixing between shallow groundwaters and \n\ndeep groundwaters occurs. This means that the geochemical processes triggered by such \n\nmixing have been occurring for the past thousands of years (at least since the present \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n86 \n\ntopography at Forsmark has formed, Berglund et al., 2009), leading to the present-day \n\nhydrogeochemical conditions. \n\nIn order to reach a geochemical quasi-steady state that represents the present-day \n\nhydrogeochemical conditions of the glacial clays at Forsmark, a long period of reactive \n\ntransport (2700 years) with the natural composition of clay porewater and deep \n\ngroundwater flowing through the modelled domain (according to the boundary conditions \n\nshown in Figure 3.4) has been simulated. After attaining the geochemical quasi-steady \n\nstate, repository release is simulated (for additional 2700 years more) by adding \nRD\n\nU, \n\nRD\nSr, \n\nRD\nCs and Ra to the deep groundwater that is flowing through the modelled domain \n\n(according to the values listed in Table 3.5). \n\nRepository release is simulated according to a very pessimistic scenario, where the \n\n~500 m of granitic bedrock (between the repository and the lake deposits) and the \n\nengineered barriers of the repository are assumed to have a very low retention capacity \n\nover radionuclides, which is highly unlikely. In this context, radionuclide concentrations \n\ncalculated for the near-field of the repository (Duro et al., 2006b), i.e., the vicinity of the \n\ncanisters that contain the HLNW, are applied directly as the input concentrations in the \n\npresent numerical simulations. Following this methodology, the concentration of \nRD\n\nSr and \n\nRD\nU in the deep groundwater was calculated by equilibrating the selected deep \n\ngroundwater sample with their solubility limiting phases, which correspond to celestite and \n\namorphous uraninite, respectively. The resulting aqueous concentration is 8.4\u00d710\n2\n \n\n?mol\u00b7L\n-1\n of \n\nRD\nSr and 1.7\u00d710\n\n-2\n ?mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n of \n\nRD\nU. \n\nSince the solubility limiting phases for Ra and \nRD\n\nCs in the near-field of a HLNW repository \n\nare difficult to define, it was decided to calculate the corresponding concentrations from \n\nthe radioactive release doses estimated for both radionuclides at the near-field (SKB, \n\n2006). The reported releases are 2\u00d710\n3\n Bq\u00b7Lwater\n\n-1\n and 7.55\u00d710\n\n2\n Bq\u00b7Lwater\n\n-1\n for \n\n135\nCs, and \n\n226\nRa, respectively. By dividing these values by the respective radioactive decay constants \n\nand the Avogadro constant, the release doses can be converted into the following \n\nconcentrations: 3.48\u00d710\n-1\n\n ?mol\u00b7Lwater\n-1\n and 9.15\u00d710\n\n-5\n ?mol\u00b7Lwater\n\n-1\n of \n\nRD\nCs and Ra, \n\nrespectively. \n\nThese radionuclide concentrations are very high, considering that it is known that the \n\nengineered barriers and granitic bedrock should be able to retain much of these \n\nradionuclides. Nevertheless, since the objective of the study is to evaluate the retention \n\ncapacity of the glacial clay sediments at Forsmark, such an extreme (pessimistic) scenario \n\nhas been assumed. \n\n\n\nIII. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n87 \n\n \n\n3.5.4 Spatial and time discretisation \n\nSpatial discretisation of the modelled domain was set 0.1 m along both axes (X and Y) for \n\nthe whole domain. \n\nAs detailed in the previous section, there are two important time stages regarding the \n\nchemical condition of the system: (i) the first stage occurs at the beginning of the \n\nsimulation period, when deep groundwater flows into the modelled domain and triggers \n\nmajor geochemical changes until a new geochemical quasi-steady state is reached, and \n\n(ii) the second stage occurs when the increased concentration of radionuclides in deep \n\ngroundwater (that simulates repository release) disturbs the previous geochemical state. \n\nAccording to these time stages, time discretisation was refined at the beginning of the \n\nsimulation period, then set progressively coarser until approximately 2700 years, and then \n\nrefined again when the inflow of repository-derived radionuclides takes place. Then, time \n\ndiscretisation becomes coarser until the end of the simulation period. \n\nTo ensure numerical stability in the solute transport calculations, the Peclet criterion \n\n(Pe?2) is met for the spatial discretisation of the modelled domain (?X =0.1 m with a \n\nlongitudinal dispersivity = 0.5 m, and ?Y =0.1 m with a transverse dispersivity = 0.2 m). \n\nThe Peclet number is a dimensionless number which compares the characteristic time for \n\ndispersion and diffusion given a length scale with its characteristic time for advection, and \n\nis given by the following equation: \n\nxxx\n\nx\n\nD\n\nxv\nPe\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?                                                                                          (equation 3.1) \n\n \n\nwhere Pe is the Peclet number, v is water velocity (obtained by dividing Darcy\u2019s velocity \n\nover the effective porosity) in units of [LT\n-1\n], ?x is the spatial discretization along the X \n\naxis, Dxx is the dispersion-coefficient tensor in units of [L\n2\nT], and ?x is the dispersivity \n\nalong the X axis in [L]. If the Peclet criterion is fulfilled, numerical oscillations should not \n\noccur (Unger et al., 1996). \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n88 \n\n3.6 Results \n\n3.6.1 Transport of conservative and reactive solutes \n\nThe transport of solutes in the modelled domain is affected by geochemical processes \n\nand the groundwater flow generated from the prescribed initial and boundary conditions. \n\nThe conservative solute transport has been predicted using chlorine as a tracer, given that \n\nno retention process has been implemented for this element. Computed breakthrough \n\ncurves of solutes have been analysed at the top right node of the discharge boundary of \n\nthe modelled domain where the fastest arrival of solutes to a hypothetical overlying \n\nsurface water body is expected.

Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n89 \n\n3.6.2 Present-day hydrogeochemical conditions \n\nLong term simulations of groundwater flow and reactive solute transport (2700 years) with \n\nthe selected minerals were done in order to reproduce the present-day hydrogeochemical \n\nconditions at Forsmark. Model results led to background concentrations of uranium, \n\nstrontium, and caesium that are highly consistent with the values observed in the near-\n\nsurface systems at Forsmark. \n\nDuring the approach to the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions different processes \n\nthat influence the behaviour of the natural isotopes of the studied radionuclides may be \n\ndepicted which help us to understand the expected mobility of these radionuclides in the \n\nglacial clays at Forsmark. Figure 3.6 (a) shows that at the beginning of the simulation, a \n\nslight decrease of U(aq) is computed for the discharge area of the glacial clay. During this \n\nperiod no uranium pure phase is formed and therefore, the computed evolution of U(aq) is \n\nsolely attributed to mixing which leads to its dilution. This slight decrease is due to the fact \n\nthat U(aq) concentration in deep groundwater is approximately half an order of magnitude \n\nlower than in the glacial clay porewater (Table 3.5). Sr(aq) concentration in deep \n\ngroundwater is approximately one order of magnitude higher than in the glacial clay \n\nporewater and, although the numerical simulation computes the retention of strontium in \n\nthe solid phase via co-precipitation with calcite and adsorption on illite, Sr(aq) \n\nconcentration increases from 0.6 ?mol\u00b7L\n-1\n (glacial clay porewater concentration, Table \n\n3.5) to 20 ?mol\u00b7L\n-1\n. The continuous, but progressively slower, increase of the Sr(aq) \n\nconcentration at the discharge (Figure 3.6(b)) area reflects the decreasing capacity of illite \n\nand calcite to incorporate more strontium along time, since available exchange sites \n\nespecially in illite become more and more scarce. Cs(aq) concentration in deep \n\ngroundwater is approximately two and a half orders of magnitude higher than in the clay \n\nporewater. Computed Cs(aq) concentration increases during the first 250 years (Figure \n\n3.6(c)), followed by a progressive decrease towards a quasi-steady state value of 5.7 \u00d7 \n\n10\n-4\n ?mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n . In the first stage, cation exchange in illite is not able to buffer the increment \n\nof Cs(aq) in solution due to deep groundwater inflow, but with increasing time Cs(aq) is \n\nprogressively retained in a larger area of the modelled domain and, therefore, its \n\nconcentration at the discharge boundary tends to decrease. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n90 \n\n(a) \n\n0 1000 2000 3000\n\nTime (years)\n\n0.000\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n[U\n(a\n\nq\n)]\n\n (\n?\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\n(b) \n\n0 1000 2000 3000\n\nTime (years)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n[S\nr(\n\na\nq\n\n)]\n (\n?\n\nm\no\nl/\nL\n)\n\n \n\n(c) \n\n0 1000 2000 3000\n\nTime (years)\n\n0.0E+000\n\n2.0E-004\n\n4.0E-004\n\n6.0E-004\n\n8.0E-004\n\n[C\ns\n(a\n\nq\n)]\n\n (\n?\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6.

The concentrations at 2700 years are in the range of concentrations observed nowadays \n\nwhich are reported in the forth section of this work. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 3.7 it is possible to see that after the approach to the present-day \n\nhydrogeochemical conditions (2700 years of reactive transport), simulated data for \n\nstrontium against calcium and for uranium against bicarbonate plot within the range of \n\nmeasured data. \n\nMeasured data for uranium and bicarbonate at Forsmark show a considerable wide range \n\nof values (Figure 3.7a). Simulated data plot close to the lowest content of these elements \n\nmeasured at Forsmark (Figure 3.7a). Simulated data for strontium against calcium (Figure \n\n3.7b) plot along the mixing trend and the dilute waters trend previously reported in Figure \n\n3.2. The deep groundwater is more mineralised than the glacial clay porewater and \n\ntherefore, the more diluted simulated compositions correspond to the points of the \n\nmodelled domain that are more distant to the deep groundwater inflow point, while the \n\nmore mineralised simulated compositions, with higher strontium and calcium content, are \n\ncloser to the deep groundwater inflow point (Figure 3.7c). \n\n\n\nIII.

This increase, combined with the prevailing reducing conditions of \n\nthe glacial clay, triggers the precipitation of amorphous uraninite. When amorphous \n\nuraninite precipitates, both repository-derived and natural uranium are incorporated in this \n\nmineral phase. It should be noted that, although humic acids and aqueous carbonates are \n\npresent in the glacial clay porewater, favouring uranium aqueous complexation, the \n\npredominantly reducing conditions of the glacial clays provide the precipitation of \n\namorphous uraninite which leads to the retention of \nRD\n\nU in the solid phase. \n\n \n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\nRDU(s) \n\n(?mol/kg\nsolid\n\n)\n\nDeep groundwater\n\n[RDU(aq)] =1.7E-02 ?mol/L\n\n0 1000 2000 3000\nTime after repository release (years)\n\n0.000\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n(?\nm\n\no\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\nU(aq)\nRDU(aq)\n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 \u2013 Computed distribution of repository-derived uranium precipitated as \n\namorphous uraninite, 2700 years after repository release (in \nRD\n\nU(s), s stands for \n\nconcentration in the solid phase).

Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n95 \n\n \n\nThe decrease of Ra(aq) concentration from the deep groundwater inflow point to the \n\ndischarge area of the glacial clay is mainly due to dilution, since the glacial clay \n\ngroundwater flowing through the modelled domain carries no radium in solution. \n\nThe geochemical processes considered to occur in the glacial clays at Forsmark have \n\nbeen proved able to efficiently retain \nRD\n\nU, \nRD\n\nSr and \nRD\n\nCs. On the other hand, with the \n\ngeochemical process assumed to interact with radium, no retention is computed for this \n\nradionuclide since barite saturation is not reached during the simulation time. \n\nRetention of \nRD\n\nU, \nRD\n\nSr and \nRD\n\nCs in the glacial clay has been quantitatively assessed by \n\ndefining a retention efficiency parameter. The retention efficiency (E) of the system under \n\nevaluation, at a given time (?) can be quantitatively evaluated according to: \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nC\n\nR\n\nC\n\nC\nE 1100                                                                                     (equation 3.2) \n\n \n\nwhere CR\n?\n stands for the concentration of a solute at time ?, in a given node of the \n\nmodelled domain, when reactive transport processes are considered, and CC\n?\n stands for \n\nthe concentration of the same solute at time ?, in the same position, but without \n\nconsidering any reactive process coupled to the transport equation (i.e. assuming \n\nconservative behaviour of the solute). \n\nAccording to equation 3.2, a null reactive concentration (CR\n?\n) means that no mass of \n\nradionuclide is leaving the system at time ?, resulting in a retention efficiency of 100%. A \n\nreactive concentration (CR\n?\n) equal to the conservative concentration (CC\n\n?\n) means that no \n\nretention is occurring and that the corresponding retention efficiency is 0%. Negative \n\nefficiency means that in the reactive transport, the solid phase is releasing a previously \n\nretained species into solution, and therefore reactive concentration is higher than \n\nconservative concentration (CR\n?\n > CC\n\n?\n). \n\nThe computed evolution of retention efficiency of the glacial clay for \nRD\n\nU, \nRD\n\nSr and \nRD\n\nCs is \n\nplotted in Figure 3.12. From the three radionuclides predicted to be retained in the solid \n\nphase of the glacial clay, uranium is the only that is not involved in sorption processes; \n\ninstead, it is retained via precipitation of a pure phase. The computed evolution of \n\nretention efficiency for \nRD\n\nU reflects the equilibrium with amorphous uraninite which leads \n\nthe system to a stable efficiency value of 50%. Immediately after repository release, the \n\nglacial clay reaches a retention efficiency for \nRD\n\nSr of 100%, but thereafter, retention \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n96 \n\nefficiency for \nRD\n\nSr drops to 20% which reflects the progressive decreasing capacity of illite \n\nand calcite to incorporate more strontium, as previously observed. Due to the high affinity \n\nof caesium for the FES of illite, retention efficiency for \nRD\n\nCs is 100% during the whole \n\nsimulation time. \n\n \n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\nTime after repository release (years)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nR\ne\n\nte\nn\n\nti\no\n\nn\n e\n\nff\nic\n\nie\nn\n\nc\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 \u2013 Computed evolution of retention efficiency for \nRD\n\nU (dashed line), \nRD\n\nSr (grey \n\nsquares) and \nRD\n\nCs (solid line), at the discharge area of the glacial clay (top right corner of \n\nmodelled domain; node X= 10 m, Y= 1 m). \n\n \n\n3.7 Conclusions \n\nThe present work has focused on the coupled hydrogeochemical processes that occur in \n\nthe Quaternary glacial clays observed in the groundwater discharge areas at Forsmark, \n\nwhich may contribute to the retention of radionuclides potentially released from a \n\nrepository. Numerical simulations of groundwater flow and reactive solute transport are \n\nable to reproduce the observed natural concentrations of uranium, strontium and caesium \n\nat the Forsmark site. These results prove the reliability of the conceptual and numerical \n\nmodels developed. Natural concentration of radium at Forsmark shallow groundwaters is \n\nextremely low so that its natural occurrence has been neglected in the numerical \n\nsimulations. \n\nThe simulation of pessimistic scenarios of repository release has shown that the glacial \n\nclays, present in the groundwater discharge areas at Forsmark, have geochemical \n\nfeatures that contribute to the effective retention of radionuclides. Numerical results \n\nallowed the development of a methodology for estimating radionuclide retention efficiency \n\nof the Quaternary glacial clays. \n\n\n\nIII. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas \n\n97 \n\nComputed results show that only uranium, strontium, and caesium are effectively retained \n\nin the solid phase of the glacial clays at Forsmark. Retention of radium is not predicted \n\nbecause barite precipitation, which is the only process considered to retain this \n\nradionuclide, is not reached during the simulated period and the mobilised Ra(II) \n\nconcentrations are not sufficient to reach saturation with respect to pure RaSO4(s) \n\nphases. \n\nNumerical results show that when repository release is simulated, precipitation of \n\namorphous uraninite is triggered by the increase of U(aq) concentration and therefore, \n\nboth natural and repository-derived uranium are retained in the solid phase. This reaction \n\nleads to a steady retention efficiency for \nRD\n\nU of 50%. \nRD\n\nSr is retained in the solid phase via \n\ncation exchange in illite and co-precipitation with calcite. Retention efficiency for \nRD\n\nSr is \n\ncomplete (100%) immediately after repository release, but it progressively drops to 20% \n\nafter about 3000 years. Caesium shows high affinity for the frayed edge sites of illite which \n\nresults in 100% retention efficiency during the whole simulation period. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work has been funded by SKB.

This is particularly true \n\nin the case of high-level nuclear waste (HLNW) repositories placed in granite. In this work \n\nwe present a modelling procedure to quantitatively determine the retention capacity of a \n\nQuaternary till in the Forsmark area, which has been recently selected to host the deep \n\ngeologic storage of HLNW in Sweden. Reactive transport numerical models have been \n\nused to simulate the intrusion of a deep groundwater carrying radionuclides potentially \n\nreleased from a repository into a Quaternary till. Four radionuclides (\n235\n\nU, \n135\n\nCs, \n226\n\nRa and \n\n90\nSr) have been selected according to their different geochemical behaviour and potential \n\ndose relevance to surface ecosystems. Numerical results indicate that repository-derived \n\n(i) uranium will have a minor impact in the till, mainly due to the high natural concentration \n\nof uranium and its adsorption on ferrihydrite; (ii) caesium will be efficiently retained by \n\ncation exchange in illite; (iii) radium will be retained via co-precipitation with barite; and \n\nalthough (iv) strontium will be retained via co-precipitation with calcite and cation \n\nexchange in illite, the retention capacity of the Quaternary till for strontium is limited. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Quaternary sediments/granite interface, Radionuclides, Retention efficiency, \n\nReactive solute transport, PHAST \n\n                                                \n\n4\n This work has been submitted to Applied Geochemistry Journal, and has been developed by the \n\nfollowing co-authors: Fidel Grandia\na\n, Clara Sena\n\na,b\n, David Arcos\n\na\n, Jorge Molinero\n\na\n, Lara Duro\n\na\n and \n\nJordi Bruno\na\n \n\na\n Amphos XXI Consulting S.L., Spain; \n\nb \nI&amp;D GeoBioTec, University of Aveiro, Portugal \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n104 \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nThe concepts of deep geological disposal for HLNW are designed to retard for long \n\nperiods of time (~10,000 years after closure) the migration of radionuclides to the surface \n\n(SKB, 2006). A deep geological repository for HLNW consists of a deep repository (~500 \n\nm depth) composed of engineered (metal canisters, clay barriers, cement liners) and \n\nnatural (host rocks) barriers that prevent the intrusion of groundwaters and further \n\ndissolution of radionuclides from the HLNW. In performance and safety assessments of \n\nthese repositories, scenarios of barrier failure and subsequent release of radionuclides to \n\nthe surrounding environment are under investigation. \n\nThe Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) has been studying \n\ntwo alternative sites (Forsmark and Laxemar) to locate a deep geological repository for \n\nHLNW and has recently selected the Forsmark area for the final emplacement. The host \n\nrock for the repository in both sites is a metagranitoid covered by glacial and post-glacial \n\nQuaternary sediments. In case of repository release, the Quaternary sediments present at \n\nthe Earth\u2019s surface/granite interface, constitute the last geological barrier prior to the \n\nsurface biosphere. The radionuclide solubility control of surface sediments and soils is \n\nwell known from present-day analogues of possible future releases from deep \n\nrepositories. The best investigated example of these analogues is the Hanford site \n\n(Washington, USA) (Zachara et al., 2002; McKinley et al., 2007; Um et al., 2007; among \n\nothers). \n\nIn the last years, reactive transport numerical models have been applied to solve different \n\nenvironmental problems such as large-scale models of transport in fractured media \n\n(Molinero et al., 2008), geochemical evolution of engineered barriers (Arcos et al., 2008), \n\norganic contaminant biodegradation (Prommer et al., 2006), acid mine drainage (Bain et \n\nal., 2000), among many others. Numerical tools are especially useful when dealing with \n\nlong-term performance assessment of deep geological repositories, mainly due to the \n\npossibility of coupling (i) groundwater flow, (ii) transport of solutes and (iii) complex \n\ngeochemical processes, for long time spans. In the present work, reactive transport \n\nnumerical models have been used to simulate the intrusion of a deep groundwater \n\ncarrying radionuclides potentially released from a repository into a Quaternary till. The \n\noutcomes of the simulations have provided a quantitative assessment of the retention \n\ncapacity of the Quaternary till at Forsmark for selected radionuclides. \n\n \n\n\n\nIV. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) \n\n105 \n\n4.1.1 Scope \n\nThe retention of selected radionuclides in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of \n\nthe Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) is assessed in the present work by means of reactive \n\ntransport numerical simulations. The radionuclides selected are: \n235\n\nU as a redox-sensitive \n\nactinide; \n135\n\nCs as a monovalent cation that participates in cation exchange in illite and also \n\nbecause it is an important contributor of radioactive doses to the surface systems (SKB, \n\n2006); \n90\n\nSr as a divalent cation that interacts with carbonate minerals and participates in \n\ncation exchange in illite; and, \n226\n\nRa as the main contributor of radioactive doses to the \n\nsurface systems (SKB, 2006). \n\nTill is the most abundant outcropping Quaternary deposit at Forsmark (~75% of surface \n\nextension, SKB, 2005a) and, therefore, it was selected in the present work for the \n\nassessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the \n\nFennoscandian shield. \n\nThe methodology applied here relies on six main steps: (1) a thorough review of site \n\nspecific data that describe the hydrogeochemical behaviour of the system under study; (2) \n\ndevelopment of the conceptual model of the system based on data gathered in the first \n\nstep; (3) identification and quantification of the thermodynamic parameters that describe \n\nthe geochemical processes of interest; (4) implementation and verification against \n\nmeasured data of the conceptual model in reactive transport numerical simulations; (5) \n\nsimulation of a hypothetical repository release in the numerical model; and, (6) \n\nquantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the modelled system based on the \n\noutputs of the numerical simulations. \n\nSite specific data that describe the hydraulic, hydrochemical and geochemical present-day \n\nconditions of the Quaternary till at Forsmark have been thoroughly analysed from the SKB \n\ndatabase of the Forsmark Site Characterization Program (SKB, 2005a). The conceptual \n\nmodel of the Quaternary till was then implemented in a reactive transport numerical model \n\nin order to reproduce the present-day conditions observed at the near-surface systems at \n\nForsmark. Once the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions of the Quaternary till at \n\nForsmark have been modelled, a hypothetical repository release was simulated by a \n\ncontinuous injection, during approximately 2500 years, of a deep groundwater carrying \n\nrepository-derived radionuclides into the modelled domain. Finally, from the outputs of the \n\nnumerical simulations, the retention of radionuclides in the Quaternary till has been \n\nassessed. \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n106 \n\n4.2 Near-surface hydrogeology at Forsmark \n\nThe Forsmark area belongs to the Fennoscandian shield predominantly made up with \n\nmetagranitoids and metavolcanics of Precambrian age, which are affected by ductile \n\nstructures and a dense fracture network. More recently, the alternation of glacial and \n\ninterglacial stages during the Quaternary period led to the deposition of glacial deposits \n\nthat cover more than 80% of the surface (SKB, 2005b). \n\nThe near-surface hydrogeology at Forsmark is composed of Quaternary deposits, with an \n\naverage thickness of 3 m that host unconfined aquifers discharging into streams, lakes or \n\nthe Baltic Sea. Groundwater in the granitic bedrock flows mainly along fractures and \n\ndeformation zones composed of loose granitic material and coatings of calcite, chlorite, \n\nquartz and pyrite (Drake et al., 2006). \n\nIn general, the till deposit consists of sand with variable amounts of boulders and clay \n\n(Albrecht, 2005). The origin of this till is associated with the glacial erosion, transport and \n\ndeposition of Palaeozoic carbonate rocks located northwards from Forsmark (Tr\u00f6jbom \n\nand S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006), and therefore carbonate minerals are abundant in the Quaternary \n\ndeposits. The mean calcite content in the Quaternary till is 24 wt% (SKB, 2005a). Besides \n\ncalcite, quartz and illite have also been identified in the mineralogical assemblage of the \n\nQuaternary till. \n\nRegional groundwater flows in Quaternary deposits from elevated inland areas towards \n\nthe Baltic Sea, with local discharge into the water courses that feed lakes and wetlands \n\n(Johansson et al., 2005). Hydrogeological investigations reveal that hydraulic connections \n\nbetween Quaternary deposits and the granitic bedrock could be in a downward direction \n\n(Bosson and Berglund, 2006). Nevertheless, local upward flow paths, between bedrock \n\nand Quaternary deposits, are also believed to occur (Laaksoharju et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n4.3 Model development \n\nThe retention capacity of the Quaternary till at Forsmark is evaluated, for selected \n\nradionuclides (uranium, caesium, strontium, and radium), using reactive transport \n\nnumerical simulations. The code used for the simulations is PHAST v. 1.4.2 (Parkhurst et \n\nal., 2004). The geochemical simulations conducted to define the initial and boundary \n\nconditions of the reactive transport simulations were performed in PHREEQC v. 2.14.2 \n\n(Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). \n\n\n\nIV. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) \n\n107 \n\nThe database used in the simulations is an extension of the NAGRA-PSI database, \n\noriginally compiled by Hummel et al. (2002), which was made in the frame of the SKB\u2019s \n\nproject SKB-TDB (Duro et al., 2006a). This database contains a large set of complexation \n\nreactions as well as pure mineral equilibrium reactions for many radionuclides and trace \n\nelements. \n\nThe numerical simulations developed in this work rely on a hypothetical scenario where a \n\nradionuclide-bearing, deep groundwater flows upwards from the repository to the surface, \n\nreaching the Quaternary till (Figure 4.1). It should be noted that the numerical model \n\ndeveloped aims at depicting a realistic evolution of the Quaternary till at Forsmark and is \n\nbased on site specific data whenever possible, although it considers a hypothetical \n\nscenario. \n\n \n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nE\nle\n\nv\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\n a\n\ns\nl)\n\n100 m100 m\n\nSurface water\n\nWetland Till\n\nPost-glacial clay\n\nGlacial clay\n\nBedrock\n\nFracture\n\nFracture zone\n\nLegend:\n\nGroundwater flow direction\n\nHypothetical path of a repository-derived radionuclide\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Near-surface hydrogeological conceptual model of Forsmark candidate site \n\n(modified from Johansson et al., 2005) showing a hypothetical path of radionuclides \n\nreleased from a repository. The section of the Quaternary till under study is highlighted with \n\na red rectangle. \n\n \n\n4.3.1 Natural isotopes of the studied radionuclides at Forsmark \n\nThe concentrations of the natural isotopes of the selected radionuclides (\n235\n\nU, \n90\n\nSr, \n135\n\nCs \n\nand \n226\n\nRa) at Forsmark have been studied in order to identify their background \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n108 \n\nconcentrations and achieve insights on the key geochemical processes that influence their \n\nmobility in the Quaternary till. \n\nIn shallow groundwaters at Forsmark, uranium concentrations range from 1.0 \u00d7 10\n-10\n\n to \n\n1.5 \u00d7 10\n-7\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006). This wide range indicates variable \n\nredox conditions in the near-surface systems. Uranium is commonly transported forming \n\ncomplexes with bicarbonate, phosphate, iron and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) \n\n(Grenthe et al., 1992). However, none of these ions shows clear correlation with uranium \n\nat Forsmark, suggesting that multiple geochemical processes are responsible for the \n\nmobility of uranium in these waters. The presence of calcite in most of the Quaternary till \n\nat Forsmark leads to the predominance of circum-neutral waters with considerable \n\namounts of dissolved carbonates which, in turn, enhance the mobility of uranium in these \n\nnear-surface waters. From elemental analysis of the solid phase of the Quaternary \n\ndeposits, rough correlations between uranium and iron, manganese and phosphorous are \n\nobserved, indicating that uranium could be associated with Fe-Mn oxides or phosphates. \n\nStrontium concentrations in shallow groundwaters range between 1.5 \u00d7 10\n-6\n and 5 \u00d7 10\n\n-5\n \n\nmol\u00b7L\n-1\n (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006). Two correlation trends are observed between \n\nstrontium and calcium in the shallow groundwaters at Forsmark. One trend involves high \n\nsalinity waters and represents a mixing trend, while the other trend includes dilute waters, \n\nwith a Sr/Ca (molar ratio) of 10\n-4\n that is consistent with congruent dissolution of a Sr-\n\nbearing calcite in the solid phase. Bruno et al. (2002) obtained an average Sr/Ca (molar \n\nratio) of 3.5 \u00d7 10\n-3\n in a set of groundwaters from different environments. \n\n \n\n0.0E+000 8.0E-003 1.6E-002\n\n[Ca] (mol\u00b7L-1)\n\n0.0E+000\n\n1.0E-005\n\n2.0E-005\n\n3.0E-005\n\n4.0E-005\n\n5.0E-005\n\n[S\nr]\n\n (\nm\n\no\nl\u00b7\nL\n\n-1\n)\n\nmixing\ntrend\n\nr2= 0.990\n\n[Sr] = 3.2E-03[Ca] - 6.4E-07\n\nr2= 0.972\n\n[Sr] = 6.8E-04[Ca] + 3.0E-08\n\ndilute waters\n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Observed correlations between strontium and calcium in shallow groundwaters \n\nof Forsmark candidate area. \n\n\n\nIV.

These range from 5\u00d710\n\u201311\n\n to 1\u00d710\n\u20139\n\n mol\u00b7L\n-1\n (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006) which \n\nreveals relatively low concentrations of caesium in natural waters. With the available data \n\nno clear correlations with other ions have been observed. Nevertheless, caesium is \n\nexpected to be involved in cation exchange in interlayered clays like illite (Bradbury and \n\nBaeyens, 2000, among others). \n\nRadium concentration in natural waters is usually very low, ranging from 10\n-14\n\n to 10\n-11\n\n \n\nmol\u00b7L\n-1\n. Among the 22 shallow groundwater samples collected in Forsmark for radium \n\nanalysis (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006) five were below detection limit for radium \n\n(1 \u00d7 10\n-14\n\n mol\u00b7L\n-1\n), and the maximum radium concentration reached was 1.09 \u00d7 10\n\n-\n\n13\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Hydrodynamic processes and parameters \n\nAccording to the findings of the site characterization programme developed by SKB, the \n\ntill deposit hosts unconfined porous aquifers with stratified hydraulic conductivity and \n\nporosity (Johansson et al., 2005).

The retention \n\ncapacity of the till for the selected radionuclides depends on the geochemical processes \n\nconsidered. Finally, since the main objective of this work is the evaluation of the retention \n\nof radionuclides in the till, radioactive decay of the selected radionuclides is not \n\nconsidered. \n\nGiven the strong correlation between strontium and calcium observed in the dilute shallow \n\ngroundwaters at Forsmark (Figure 4.2), calcite is considered to contain trace amounts of \n\nstrontianite forming a non-ideal solid solution (Tesoriero and Pankow, 1996) in the \n\nnumerical simulations. \n\nThe initial molar fraction of strontium in calcite results from equilibrating the calcite-\n\nstrontianite solid solution with the selected till groundwater sample. The parameters used \n\nfor this solid solution are those of Tesoriero and Pankow (1996), and the resulting \n\nstrontium molar fraction is 1.73 \u00d7 10\n-5\n. From the mean 24 wt% of calcite in the Quaternary \n\ntill we have considered that only 6.2 v% are available to react with the porewater. This 6.2 \n\nv% of reactive calcite correspond to the outer 0.05 mm rim of the 2  mm sized calcite \n\ngrains that constitute the most of the calcite content of the Quaternary till. By multiplying \n\nthe 24 wt% by 6.2v% we obtain 1.5 wt% of reactive calcite implemented in the numerical \n\nsimulations. Since the studied groundwaters are rich in aqueous carbonate, Fe(III) \n\ncarbonate complexes have been added to the thermodynamic database (Griv\u00e9, 2005). \n\nAlthough illite has been identified as the main clay mineral in the Quaternary till at \n\nForsmark no data on illite content has been found, and therefore a 10 wt% as been \n\nconsidered for the numerical simulations. Illite dissolution kinetics is very slow under the \n\nenvironmental conditions modelled here (K\u00f6hler et al., 2003). Therefore, dissolution of \n\nillite is not considered, and it only participates as a charged surface for cation exchange, \n\nincluding strontium and caesium. The model for cation exchange in illite implemented in \n\nthe numerical simulations follows the model proposed by Bradbury and Baeyens (2000) \n\n(see Table A1.1 in Appendix 1). According to this model (Bradbury and Baeyens, 2000), \n\nthere are three types of exchangeable sites. The most abundant sites (~80% of CEC, \n\nwhich is 0.2 eq?kg\n-1\n) are the \u201cPlanar sites\u201d, which sorb divalent and monovalent cations. \n\nThe second and third types of sites (\u201cType II\u201d and frayed edge sites \u201cFES\u201d) involve solely \n\nmonovalent cations. The site density is much lower (20% and 0.25% of the total sites, \n\nrespectively), but the uptake of some cations like Cs\n+\n on the FES is particularly efficient. \n\n\n\nIV. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) \n\n111 \n\nStrontium is also expected to be involved in cation exchange in illite (e.g. Cole et al., \n\n2000), and therefore strontium was added to the cation exchange model implemented in \n\nthe numerical simulations (see Table A1.1 in Appendix 1). \n\nIt is very likely that other phases exist at minor concentrations, some of which can play an \n\nimportant role in the control of the redox conditions and radionuclide retention. Among \n\nthese, ferrihydrite (Fe(OH)3) is thought to be the controlling phase for the redox of the till \n\nporewater and the main uranium sorbent. The surface complexation model followed is that \n\nof Waite et al. (1994) which considers two types of adsorption sites; strong and weak \n\nbinding (see Table A1.3 in Appendix 1). \n\nAccording to the elemental content of Fe in the solid phase of the Quaternary till, ranging \n\nfrom 0.54 to 2.22 wt% (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006), an initial content of 0.15 wt% of \n\nferrihydrite has been set in the numerical simulations. \n\nUnlike illite, ferrihydrite is a much more reactive mineral, very sensitive to changes in the \n\nredox state of the system. Intrusion of deep groundwater in the till domain may lead to \n\ndissolution of ferrihydrite, and therefore, the total amount of sites available for adsorption, \n\nin the simulations, depends on the remaining moles of ferrihydrite for each time step. \n\nSiderite (FeCO3) is also redox sensitive and can precipitate in the till after the inflow of Fe-\n\nrich deep groundwater which is more reducing than till porewater. Consequently, siderite \n\nis allowed to precipitate if oversaturation is reached. \n\nTill groundwater in Forsmark is very close to barite saturation, and the precipitation of this \n\nmineral (and radium co-precipitation) is expected due to the intrusion of deep groundwater \n\nwith a relatively high sulphate concentration. \n\nGiven the relatively fast reactivity of the reactive minerals previously identified, under the \n\ngeochemical conditions simulated here, all geochemical reactions are simulated under \n\nlocal equilibrium. Table 4.2 lists the initial concentrations of the reactive minerals \n\nconsidered in the numerical simulations, as well as the radionuclides potentially \n\nincorporated in these minerals. \n\nThe saturation index of relevant pure phases that may incorporate the studied \n\nradionuclides, was monitored during the simulations for the following phases: amorphous \n\nuraninite, becquerelite, schoepite and soddyite (for U); celestite and strontianite (for Sr); \n\nand radium sulphate (for Ra). None of these minerals attained oversaturation, and \n\ntherefore, they were discarded from the simulations. \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n112 \n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Initial concentration of the reactive minerals considered for the reactive \n\ntransport simulations.

The bottom boundary of the modelled domain \n\nrepresents the contact between the till and the bedrock. In order to simulate the transfer of \n\nrepository-derived radionuclides to the near-surface systems, a deep groundwater flowing \n\nupwards through a fracture of the granitic bedrock is assumed to transport dissolved \n\nradionuclides from the repository to the surface. The Quaternary till is assumed to be \n\nhydraulically connected to a discharge area such as a river, a lake or the Baltic Sea. \n\nAccording to the water balance calculations developed for Forsmark (Johansson et al., \n\n2005), a constant inflow rate of 14.5 L/d is assigned along the vertical left boundary. The \n\nfracture through which deep groundwater enters the till is represented by a constant inflow \n\nboundary at the bottom of the modelled domain (cell X= 20 m, Y= 0 m), with a flow rate of \n\n0.5 L/d. The discharge area is located in the last 20 m of the top boundary, with a constant \n\nhead of 3 m (Figure 4.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nIV.

To \n\ncompute the initial state of a reactive transport model, the code used here firstly \n\nequilibrates the initial porewater with the reactive minerals considered. Therefore, and in \n\norder to critically analyse the output of the initial equilibration, we have performed previous \n\nstatic calculations in PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) to define the initial \n\nporewater and boundary waters equilibrated with the minerals most likely to control the \n\ncomposition of these waters that have been identified in the previous section. \n\nThe chemistry of the groundwater in equilibrium with the till deposit has been obtained \n\nafter equilibration of a selected groundwater sample of the till aquifer with the reactive \n\nminerals identified in the previous section which are calcite-strontianite solid solution, \n\nferrihydrite and siderite (Table 4.2). As the groundwater sample is close to the equilibrium \n\nwith these minerals, the resulting composition does not differ much from the sampled \n\nwater. In Table 4.3 the water composition of the Quaternary till obtained after such \n\npreliminary equilibration is shown. \n\nAccording to the minerals identified in the coatings of the granite fractures where deep \n\ngroundwater flows (reported in section 4.2), the deep groundwater composition prior to \n\nrepository release was set by equilibrating a selected deep groundwater sample from \n\nForsmark with calcite and pyrite. This equilibration does not change much the original \n\ndeep groundwater composition, since this water sample is close to the equilibrium with \n\nthese phases. \n\nThe composition of deep groundwater affected by repository release is modified due to \n\nthe addition of repository-derived radionuclides (\n90\n\nSr, \n135\n\nCs, \n235\n\nU and \n226\n\nRa). In order to \n\ndistinguish repository-derived radionuclides from those of natural origin, radionuclides \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n114 \n\ncoming from repository were labelled as \nRD\n\nCs, \nRD\n\nSr, and \nRD\n\nU, RD standing for Repository-\n\nDerived (Table 4.3). Radium was not labelled since its presence in the modelled domain is \n\nexclusively attributed to repository release due to the extremely low concentrations \n\nobserved at Forsmark. \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 \u2013 Initial composition of till porewater and deep groundwater (Deep GW). \n\nConcentrations of \nRD\n\nCs, \nRD\n\nU, \nRD\n\nSr and Ra in the deep GW (after repository release) represent \n\nthe increment of these elements due to repository release. \n\nParameter Till GW Deep GW \nDeep GW \n\n(after repository release) \n\npH 7.12 7.16 7.16 \n\nEh (mV) 3 -145 -145 \n\nNatotal 1.22 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n 6.93 \u00d7 10\n-2\n\n 6.93 \u00d7 10\n-2\n\n \n\nKtotal 1.22 \u00d7 10\n-4\n\n 1.67 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n 1.67 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n \n\nCatotal 2.79 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n 1.35 \u00d7 10\n-2\n\n 1.35 \u00d7 10\n-2\n\n \n\nMgtotal 3.54 \u00d7 10\n-4\n\n 7.18 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n 7.18 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n \n\nC(4) 5.57 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n 2.46 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n 2.46 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n \n\nCltotal 1.90 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n 1.07 \u00d7 10\n-1\n\n 1.07 \u00d7 10\n-1\n\n \n\nSO4\n2-\n\n 2.41 \u00d7 10\n-4\n\n 3.73 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n 3.73 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n \n\nSitotal 9.74 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n 7.56 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n 7.56 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n \n\nFetotal 1.50 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n 4.91 \u00d7 10\n-4\n\n 4.91 \u00d7 10\n-4\n\n \n\nSrtotal 2.10 \u00d7 10\n-6\n\n 4.13 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n 4.13 \u00d7 10\n-5\n\n \n\nUtotal 2.23 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n 4.62 \u00d7 10\n-10\n\n 4.62 \u00d7 10\n-10\n\n \n\nCstotal 6.48 \u00d7 10\n-11\n\n 1.62 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n 1.62 \u00d7 10\n-8\n\n \n\nNH4\n+\n 6.62 \u00d7 10\n\n-6\n 1.95 \u00d7 10\n\n-4\n 1.95 \u00d7 10\n\n-4\n \n\nRD\nCs - - 3.48 \u00d7 10\n\n-7\n \n\nRD\nU - - 1.73 \u00d7 10\n\n-8\n \n\nRD\nSr - - 8.37 \u00d7 10\n\n-4\n \n\nRa - - 9.15 \u00d7 10\n-11\n\n \n\nConcentrations in mol\u00b7L\n-1\n\n \n\n \n\nThe hydrodynamic boundary conditions are constant in time, and therefore, the system is \n\nmodelled under steady state for flow, but the geochemistry of the till deposit is modelled \n\nunder transient state due to the inflow of a more reducing and mineralised deep \n\ngroundwater into the till domain. \n\n\n\nIV. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) \n\n115 \n\nThe characterization program for Forsmark site has identified discharge areas where \n\nmixing between shallow groundwaters and deep groundwaters occurs (Laaksoharju et al., \n\n2008). This means that the geochemical processes triggered by such mixing have been \n\noccurring for the past thousands of years; at least since the present topography at \n\nForsmark has formed (Berglund et al., 2009), leading to the present-day \n\nhydrogeochemical conditions. \n\nIn order to reach a geochemical quasi-steady state that represents the present-day \n\nhydrogeochemical conditions of the Quaternary till, a long period of reactive transport \n\n(2700 years) with the natural composition of till and deep groundwaters flowing through \n\nthe modelled domain has been simulated. During this long period of reactive transport \n\nsimulation, mixing between both groundwaters together with the products of the \n\ngeochemical reactions triggered by such mixing, leads to a new geochemical equilibrium. \n\nAfter attaining the geochemical quasi-steady state, repository release is simulated by \n\nincreasing the concentration of selected radionuclides in the deep groundwater that enters \n\nthe till system at the bottom of the modelled domain. \n\nRepository release is simulated according to a very pessimistic scenario, where it is \n\nassumed that the ~500 m of granitic bedrock (located between the repository and the \n\nnear-surface systems) and the engineered barriers of the repository do not have a \n\nsignificant retention capacity over radionuclides, which is highly unlikely. Therefore, \n\nradionuclide concentrations calculated for the near-field (Duro et al., 2006b), i.e., the \n\nvicinity of the canisters that contain the spent nuclear fuel, are applied directly as the input \n\nconcentrations in the present numerical simulations. Following this methodology, the \n\nconcentration of \nRD\n\nSr and \nRD\n\nU in the deep groundwater was calculated by equilibrating the \n\nselected deep groundwater sample with their solubility limiting phases, which correspond \n\nto celestite and amorphous uraninite, respectively. The resulting concentrations of \nRD\n\nSr \n\nand \nRD\n\nU are 8.4 \u00d710\n-4\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n and 1.7 \u00d710\n\n-8\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n, respectively. \n\nSince the solubility limiting phases for Ra and \nRD\n\nCs in the near-field of a HLNW repository \n\nare difficult to define, it was decided to calculate the corresponding concentration from the \n\nradioactive release doses estimated for both radionuclides at the near-field (SKB, 2006). \n\nThe reported releases are 2 \u00d7 10\n3\n Bq\u00b7L\n\n-1\n for \n\n135\nCs, and 7.55 \u00d7 10\n\n2\n Bq\u00b7L\n\n-1\n for \n\n226\nRa. By \n\ndividing these values by the respective radioactive decay constants and the Avogadro \n\nconstant, the release doses are converted into the following concentrations: 3.48 \u00d7 10\n-7\n \n\nmol\u00b7L\n-1\n of \n\nRD\nCs and 9.15 \u00d7 10\n\n-11\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n of Ra. \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n116 \n\nThese radionuclide concentrations are very high, taking into account that the engineered \n\nbarriers and granitic bedrock would be able to retain much of these radionuclides. \n\nNevertheless, since the objective of the study is to evaluate the retention capacity of the \n\nQuaternary sediments, such an extreme scenario has been assumed. \n\n \n\n4.3.5 Spatial and time discretisation \n\nThe spatial discretization of the modelled domain was set according to the main features \n\nof the boundary conditions, which influence groundwater flow and geochemistry. Spatial \n\ndiscretization was refined at the position of the deep groundwater inflow and under the \n\ndischarge area (outflow boundary). \n\nAs detailed in the previous section, there are two important stages regarding the chemical \n\ncondition of the system: (i) the first stage occurs at the beginning of the simulation, when \n\ndeep groundwater flows into the modelled domain and triggers major geochemical \n\nchanges until the geochemical quasi-steady state is reached, and (ii) the second stage \n\noccurs when the increased concentration of radionuclides in the deep groundwater (that \n\nsimulates repository release) disturbs the previous geochemical state. According to these \n\nstages, time discretization was refined at the beginning of each stage, and set \n\nprogressively coarser towards the end of each stage. \n\nTo ensure stability in the numerical calculations, the Peclet criterion (Pe?2) is met for the \n\nmaximum ?X (maximum ?X =1 m, and longitudinal dispersivity = 0.5 m). \n\n \n\n4.4 Numerical results \n\n4.4.1 Present-day hydrogeochemical conditions \n\nThe transport of solutes in the modelled domain is affected by geochemical processes \n\nand the groundwater flow generated from the prescribed initial and boundary conditions. \n\nThe conservative transport has been studied using chlorine as a tracer, given that no \n\nretention has been implemented for this element. From the chlorine breakthrough curve, \n\nobserved at the discharge area, an advective travel time of 2.3 years is obtained, from the \n\ndeep groundwater inflow point to the discharge area of the modelled domain. \n\nLong-term simulations of groundwater flow and reactive solute transport (2700 years) with \n\nthe selected reactive minerals were done in order to reproduce the present-day \n\nhydrogeochemical conditions at Forsmark.

Simulated data plot within the concentration range of these \n\nelements actually measured at Forsmark (Figure 4.4a). Similarly, simulated data for \n\nstrontium against calcium (Figure 4.4b) plot close to the dilute waters trend previously \n\nreported in Figure 4.2. The dilute shallow groundwaters at Forsmark correspond to those \n\nshallow systems that are less influenced by deep groundwater discharge and sea water \n\nintrusion (Laaksoharju et al., 2008). \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n118 \n\nData for caesium at Forsmark are scarce and no graphic is shown here. Nevertheless, \n\nmodel outputs show that the concentration of caesium (1 \u00d7 10\n-10\n\n mol\u00b7L\n-1\n) flowing out of the \n\nQuaternary till when the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions have been reached \n\n(after 2700 years of reactive transport) are within the range of caesium concentrations \n\nobserved nowadays at Forsmark, previously reported in section 4.3.1. \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Retention of repository-derived radionuclides \n\nGiven the good agreement between measured data for reactive solutes such as \n\nbicarbonate, calcium, uranium, and strontium, and the outputs of the reactive transport \n\nmodel (previously shown in Figure 4.4) that was built to simulate the present-day \n\nhydrogeochemical conditions of the Quaternary till at Forsmark, the pessimistic scenario \n\nof repository release may now be simulated by adding repository-derived radionuclides to \n\nthe deep groundwater that discharges into the till aquifer. \n\nSince the Fennoscandian shield is being subject to a regional uplift (SKB, 2005b) which \n\ntriggers gradual changes of the topography and near-surface hydrology, in order to assure \n\na relatively reliable scenario of repository release into the near-surface systems, a \n\nrelatively short period (when compared to the safety assessment of a deep geological \n\nrepository; ~100,000 years, SKB, 2006) of repository release has been simulated. In this \n\ncontext, the continuous inflow of repository-derived radionuclides into the Quaternary till \n\nhas been simulated during 2700 years. \n\nDeep groundwater affected by repository release has a \nRD\n\nU concentration which is ~1.5 \n\norders of magnitude higher than before repository release, and it is 23% lower than the \n\nnatural uranium concentration in the till groundwater (2.23 \u00d7 10\n-8\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n). At the end of \n\nthe simulation, only 1.8% of uranium flowing out of the till is derived from repository \n\n(Figure 4.5a). \nRD\n\nU is retained in the till by adsorption on the ferrihydrite (Figure 4.5b). The \n\nrelatively low impact of repository release on the concentration of aqueous uranium at the \n\ndischarge area is mainly due to the high concentration of natural uranium in the till \n\ngroundwater. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIV.

Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) \n\n123 \n\nThe reactive transport simulations predict that, in case of repository release, \nRD\n\nSr, \nRD\n\nCs, \n\nRD\nU and Radium would be retained in the till deposit (Figure 4.9). During the first 100 \n\nyears the till system reaches a retention efficiency of 100% for \nRD\n\nSr. Thereafter, retention \n\nefficiency for \nRD\n\nSr drops to 0%, ~1000 years after repository release, reflecting the limited \n\ncapacity of illite and the Ca1-?Sr?CO3 solid solution to retain the added strontium. On the \n\nother hand, \nRD\n\nCs is efficiently retained (100%) during the whole simulation due to the high \n\naffinity of caesium for the FES of illite. \n\nWhen \nRD\n\nU enters the till aquifer, the till is able to fully retain it (100% retention efficiency). \n\nThereafter, retention efficiency for \nRD\n\nU progressively decreases. This decrease is related \n\nto the fact that ferrihydrite dissolves during the simulation, due to the inflow of deep \n\ngroundwater. Since uranium is retained via adsorption on ferrihydrite, as time passes \n\nthere are progressively less available sites for uranium adsorption, and, consequently, \n\nretention efficiency for \nRD\n\nU decreases. \n\nRadium is the only radionuclide that is not assumed to be involved in sorption reactions, \n\nand therefore, its retention efficiency reflects the evolution of the thermodynamic \n\nequilibrium between the aqueous phase and the precipitation of Ba1-?Ra?SO4 solid \n\nsolution. \n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500\n\nTime after repository release (years)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nR\ne\n\nte\nn\n\nti\no\n\nn\n E\n\nff\nic\n\nie\nn\n\nc\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Computed retention efficiencies for uranium (dashed line), strontium (grey \n\nsquares), caesium (solid line) and radium (black triangles), derived from repository release, \n\nat the discharge area of the Quaternary till. \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n124 \n\n4.5 Conclusions \n\nCoupled hydrogeochemical processes that are believed to occur in the Quaternary till at \n\nForsmark have been implemented in a numerical model to assess the retention of \n\nrepository-derived radionuclides. Numerical simulations of groundwater flow and reactive \n\nsolute transport are able to reproduce the observed natural concentrations of uranium, \n\nstrontium and caesium at the Forsmark site which proves the reliability of the conceptual \n\nand numerical models developed here. Natural concentration of radium at Forsmark \n\nshallow groundwaters is extremely low so that its natural occurrence has been neglected \n\nin the numerical simulations. \n\nThe simulation of a pessimistic scenario of a continuous repository release during 2700 \n\nyears has shown that the Quaternary till has geochemical features that contribute to the \n\neffective retention of radionuclides. Numerical results show that repository-derived \n\nuranium will have a minor impact in the Quaternary till, mainly due to the high natural \n\nconcentration of uranium and its adsorption on ferrihydrite; caesium will be efficiently \n\nretained by cation exchange in illite; radium will be retained via co-precipitation with barite; \n\nand, although strontium is assumed to be retained through two geochemical processes \n\n(co-precipitation with calcite and cation exchange in illite), the retention capacity of the \n\nQuaternary till for strontium is limited. \n\nThe quantitative assessment of the retention efficiency of the Quaternary till reveals that \n\nrepository-derived caesium is the most effectively retained radionuclide (100% retention \n\nefficiency), while retention of repository-derived strontium and uranium becomes \n\nprogressively lower. Radium retention decreases during the first years after repository \n\nrelease, and then approaches a steady state of 30% retention efficiency. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work has been funded by SKB.

Estimating effective distribution \n\ncoefficients of selected radionuclides from \n\nreactive transport numerical models5 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) is carrying out a \n\ngeoscientific characterization of Forsmark for the construction of a deep geological \n\nrepository for high level nuclear waste (HLNW). Reactive transport numerical models have \n\nbeen used to assess the migration of selected radionuclides (U, Sr, Cs and Ra) within a \n\nQuaternary till aquifer that overlies the candidate granitic host rock. Simulation of a \n\nhypothetical inflow of a radionuclide-bearing granite groundwater into the Quaternary till \n\nhas provided a quantitative assessment of the migration and retention of selected \n\nradionuclides. According to numerical results, the Quaternary till behaves as a natural \n\nreactive barrier able to retain radionuclides. Computed retention of radionuclides in the \n\nsolid phase leads to a retardation of their arrival to the discharge area of the Quaternary \n\ntill. Numerical results show that the distribution coefficient (Kd) of the selected \n\nradionuclides varies in time and space in the modelled domain. Computed breakthrough \n\ncurves of the selected radionuclides have been analysed to obtain effective retardation \n\nfactors (R). Numerical results show that for those radionuclides with a high affinity for the \n\nsolid phase (e.g. Cs) and those that are solely involved in co-precipitation with mineral \n\nphases (e.g. Ra), computed breakthrough curves take very long to reach the final \n\nstabilized maximum which hinders the estimation of R and the corresponding effective Kd. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Reactive transport models, radionuclides, distribution coefficient, effective \n\nretardation factor. \n\n                                                \n\n5\n This work has been presented at the International Groundwater Symposium of the International \n\nAssociation of Hydraulic Research: Flow and Transport in Heterogeneous Subsurface Formations: \n\nTheory, Modelling &amp; Applications, in 2008. \n\nIt was developed by the following co-authors: Clara Sena\na,b\n\n, Jorge Molinero\na\n, Fidel Grandia\n\na\n, David \n\nArcos\na\n, and Lara Duro\n\na\n \n\na\n Amphos XXI Consulting S.L., Spain; \n\nb\n I&amp;D GeoBioTec, University of Aveiro, Portugal \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n130 \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nThe concept of deep geological repository in Sweden entails a number of engineered \n\n(copper canisters, clay barriers, and cement liners) and natural geological barriers to \n\nprevent and retard for long periods of time (~100,000 years) the migration of radionuclides \n\nto the surface (SKB, 2006). Forsmark has been recently selected by SKB for the \n\nconstruction of Sweden\u2019s deep geological repository for HLNW (SKB, 2009). \n\nWhen dealing with the final disposal of HLNW, radionuclide migration through the \n\nengineered and natural barriers that surround the repository must be assessed. In \n\nperformance assessment of deep geological repositories, the most probable failure \n\nscenarios of the repository and their environmental consequences are being analysed \n\n(e.g. SKB, 2006). In case of repository release, the surface sediments covering the \n\nrepository host rock represent the last geological barrier prior to the surface ecosystems. \n\nReactive transport numerical models are powerful tools that couple groundwater flow, \n\ntransport of solutes and geochemical reactions between solid and aqueous phases. By \n\nintegrating site specific data and thermodynamic databases they can provide valuable and \n\nreliable quantitative evaluations for many environmental issues among which performance \n\nassessment of a deep geological repository is undoubtedly included (Molinero and \n\nSamper, 2006, Arcos et al, 2008, among others). Nevertheless, such reliable models \n\ndemand considerable amounts of site specific data and thermodynamic parameters \n\n(needed to describe numerically the geochemical processes considered) that may not be \n\navailable. In this context, Kd-based models may provide alternative tools whenever \n\navailable data is not sufficient to implement the geochemical processes of interest for a \n\ngiven reactive transport model. \n\nThe governing equations solved by a reactive transport simulator are a set of (1) partial \n\ndifferential equations describing groundwater flow and solute transport for each aqueous \n\ncomponent; (2) non-linear algebraic equations describing equilibrium chemical reactions; \n\nand, (3) ordinary differential equations describing rates of kinetic chemical reactions \n\n(Parkhurst et al., 2004). On the other hand, in a Kd-based model the simulator does not \n\nneed to solve non-linear algebraic equations, since aqueous speciation and \n\nthermodynamic equilibrium are not solved by this type of models. Therefore, for a given \n\nmodelled domain and same number of reactive solutes, a Kd-based numerical model \n\nshould be much less time and computational demanding than a reactive transport \n\nnumerical model. \n\n\n\nV. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models \n\n131 \n\nIn 1981, Reardon discussed the reliability of Kd-based models to describe reversible ion \n\nsorption reactions in contaminant migration, concluding that if the groundwater system is \n\nin a steady state chemical evolution a Kd-based model should be as reliable as a reactive \n\ntransport model. At chemical steady state the sorbing sites at any point in the flow path \n\nare in equilibrium with the way in which groundwater is evolving chemically and therefore \n\nthe Kd of a given location should be constant over time. Based on these results, Glynn \n\n(2003) performed one-dimensional (1D) reactive transport simulations to demonstrate the \n\neffects of aqueous speciation and sorption reactions on the transport of neptunium and \n\nplutonium. The author concluded that a Kd-based model would lead to remarkably \n\ndifferent results from those attained in reactive transport simulations, pointing out the care \n\nthat must be taken when choosing the type of model to be used in the performance \n\nassessment of HLNW disposal sites. \n\nGlynn (2003) analysed the Kd obtained from the outputs of 1D reactive transport models \n\nfor two redox sensitive radionuclides, neptunium and plutonium. In the present research \n\nwork, a two-dimensional (2D) reactive transport model has been developed to predict the \n\nmigration of four radionuclides in a Quaternary till: (1) uranium as a redox sensitive \n\nactinide that may adsorb on ferrihydrite; (2) strontium as a divalent cation that may co-\n\nprecipitate with calcite (CaCO3) and participates in cation exchange in illite; (3) caesium \n\nas a monovalent cation with high affinity for the frayed edge sites (FES) of illite; and, (4) \n\nradium as a divalent cation that may co-precipitate with barite (BaSO4). \n\nFrom the output results of the 2D reactive transport model, R and effective Kd are \n\nestimated for those radionuclides for which complete breakthrough curves have been \n\ncomputed. The meaning of this effective Kd is then analysed by comparing the results \n\nattained in the 2D reactive transport model with those obtained in the 2D Kd-based model. \n\n \n\n5.2 Scope \n\nThis paper begins with a description of the reactive transport numerical model that has \n\nbeen built to predict the migration of selected radionuclides through a Quaternary till, by \n\nsimulating a hypothetical repository release. This simulation is based on site specific data, \n\ntaken from SKB\u2019s Site Descriptive Model (Johansson et al., 2005; Tr\u00f6jbom et al., 2007), \n\nthat describe the hydrogeology and geochemistry at Forsmark, and on a pessimistic \n\nscenario of repository release. In the following section, the results attained in the reactive \n\ntransport model are analysed and discussed. From the outputs of the reactive transport \n\nnumerical model, the Kd of each radionuclide in the modelled domain is analysed over \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n132 \n\ntime and space. In section 5.5, R and the effective Kd of each radionuclide are calculated \n\nfrom the outputs of the reactive transport numerical model. The meaning of this effective \n\nKd is analysed by comparing the results attained in the reactive transport simulations with \n\nthose attained in Kd-based models. Finally, the main conclusions attained in this work are \n\nlisted in section 5.6. \n\n \n\n5.3 Reactive solute transport model \n\nAt Forsmark, the granitic candidate host rock for the deep geological repository is covered \n\nby a Quaternary till which thickness ranges from 1 to 3 m (Johansson et al., 2005). \n\nGroundwater in the granitic bedrock flows mainly along fractures and deformation zones \n\ncomposed of loose granitic material and coatings of calcite, chlorite, quartz and pyrite \n\n(Drake et al., 2006). The till deposit hosts unconfined porous aquifers with stratified \n\nhydraulic conductivity and porosity (Johansson et al., 2005), and is composed mainly of \n\ncalcite, illite and trace amounts of Fe oxyhydroxides. \n\nIn order to assess the migration of radionuclides through the Quaternary till, a hypothetical \n\nscenario of repository release has been simulated using a reactive transport numerical \n\nmodel. In this hypothetical scenario a granitic groundwater carrying repository-derived \n\nradionuclides is considered to flow upwards, from the repository to the surface, reaching \n\nthe Quaternary till that discharges into a surface water body, such as a lake, a stream, or \n\nthe Baltic Sea (Figure 5.1). \n\nThe reactive transport simulations have been performed with the finite-difference code \n\nPHAST v. 1.4.2 (Parkhurst et al., 2004). This code is the result of coupling a transport \n\nsolver, HST3D (Kipp, 1987) and the well known geochemical code, PHREEQC (Parkhurst \n\nand Appelo, 1999). PHAST is able to simulate multi-component, reactive solute transport \n\nin three-dimensional saturated groundwater flow systems. The reactive transport \n\nequations are solved by sequential non iterative approach (SNIA) in which solute transport \n\nand chemical reactions are decoupled for each time step. \n\nThe thermodynamic database used in the present work (Duro et al., 2006a) is an \n\nextension of the NAGRA-PSI database, compiled by Hummel et al. (2002). This database \n\ncontains a large set of complexation reactions as well as pure mineral equilibrium \n\nreactions for many radionuclides and trace elements. \n\n \n\n\n\nV.

Table 5.1 shows average values of the hydrodynamic parameters that were used \n\nin the numerical simulations of this work. \n\nThe capacity of the Quaternary till to retain radionuclides depends mainly on the mineral \n\nassemblages present, which in turn, enable radionuclide sorption, precipitation or co-\n\nprecipitation with major element solid phases. Since the objective of this work is to assess \n\nradionuclide migration in the Quaternary till, radionuclide decay was not considered in the \n\nnumerical simulations. \n\nAccording to the main reactive minerals present in the Quaternary till and to the \n\ngeochemical behaviour of the selected radionuclides, the following geochemical \n\nprocesses have been implemented in the reactive transport model: \n\n1.

(1994) which considers two \n\ntypes of adsorption sites (see Table A1.3 in Appendix 1). Ferrihydrite is very sensitive to \n\nchanges in the redox state of the system, and the inflow of a relatively reducing deep \n\ngroundwater in the till domain can trigger its dissolution. Therefore, if ferrihydrite dissolves \n\nin the simulation, the total amount of adsorption sites decreases proportionally and vice-\n\nversa. An initial amount of 0.15 wt% of ferrihydrite has been set in the numerical model \n\n(Table 5.2). \n\nCalcite present in the Quaternary till is assumed to form a non-ideal solid solution with \n\nstrontium. The parameters describing the formation of this solid solution are those of \n\nTesoriero and Pankow (1996). An initial amount of 1.5 wt% of (Ca,Sr)CO3 has been \n\nassigned to the numerical model (Table 5.2). The initial strontium molar fraction (1.73 \u00d710\n-\n\n5\n) has been obtained after performing a numerical equilibration of the selected till \n\ngroundwater sample with the calcite-strontianite solid solution, using PHREEQC. This \n\nstrontium molar fraction is consistent with data from Forsmark (SKB, 2005a; SKB, 2005b) \n\nand also with data other natural systems, as reported by Bruno et al. (2002). \n\nIn the numerical simulations, the model for cation exchange in illite is that of Bradbury and \n\nBaeyens (2000) with some modifications (see Table A1.1 in Appendix 1, and for further \n\ndetails the reader is referred to Grandia et al., 2007). Illite dissolution kinetics is expected \n\nto be very slow under the pH conditions modelled here (K\u00f6hler et al., 2003). Therefore, a \n\n\n\nV. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models \n\n135 \n\nconstant concentration of 10 wt% of illite (with a cation exchange capacity of 200 \n\nmeq\u00b7kgsolid\n-1\n) has been assumed (Table 5.2). \n\nIn many aqueous systems, radium is strongly co-precipitated with barite due to the \n\nchemical similarity between radium and barium (Grandia et al., 2008; and references \n\ntherein). In the numerical simulations, an ideal solid solution between BaSO4 and RaSO4 \n\nhas been let to form if oversaturation with this solid solution is reached (Table 5.2). \n\n \n\nTable 5.2 \u2013 Initial concentration of the reactive minerals implemented in the reactive \n\ntransport simulations. \n\nMineral Initial \n\nconcentration of \n\nreactive mineral \n\n(wt%) \n\nMechanism of \n\nradionuclide \n\nretention \n\nPotentially retained \n\nradionuclides \n\nCa1-?Sr?CO3 \n\n(??initial?= 1.73 \u00d7 10\n-\n\n5\n)* \n\n1.5 Co-precipitation Sr \n\nIllite 10.0 Cation exchange Sr, Cs \n\nFerrihydrite (Fe(OH)3) 0.15 Adsorption U \n\nBa1-?Ra?SO4 0.0 Co-precipitation Ra \n\nSiderite (FeCO3) 0.0 - - \n\n*? stands for the molar fraction of Sr and Ra in the solid solutions in which they are involved. \n\n \n\nSiderite (FeCO3) is likely to form in carbonated systems similar to the Quaternary till under \n\nstudy; it is redox sensitive and may precipitate in the Quaternary till after the inflow of a \n\nreducing and Fe-rich deep groundwater. Therefore, siderite is allowed to precipitate in the \n\nsimulations if oversaturation with this mineral is reached. \n\nTo compute the initial state of a reactive transport model, the code used here (PHAST; \n\nParkhurst et al., 2004) firstly equilibrates the initial porewater of the modelled domain with \n\nthe reactive minerals considered. Therefore, and in order to analyse the output of such \n\ninitial equilibration, we have performed previous static calculations in PHREEQC \n\n(Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) to define the composition of the initial porewater and \n\nboundary waters of the modelled domain. In this context, the initial amount of siderite set \n\nfor the reactive transport simulations (Table 5.2), results from equilibrating the selected till \n\ngroundwater sample with this mineral. It should be noted that since the selected till \n\ngroundwater sample is close to the equilibrium with the reactive minerals considered in \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n136 \n\nthe numerical model (calcite, ferrihydrite and siderite), the composition of the till \n\ngroundwater used in the simulations is very similar to the one actually measured. \n\n \n\n5.3.2 Initial and boundary conditions \n\nThe reactive transport numerical model simulates the water flow and geochemical \n\nprocesses that occur in the Quaternary till at Forsmark. The modelled domain is a 2D \n\nvertical cross-section of the till deposit. Following Johansson et al. (2005), the thickness is \n\n3 m, and, based on the dimensions of the subcatchments in the Forsmark area, the \n\nhorizontal length is 100 m (Figure 5.2). \n\nAccording to the water balance calculations developed for Forsmark (Johansson et al., \n\n2005), a constant inflow rate of 14.5 L/d is prescribed along the vertical left boundary. The \n\nfracture through which deep groundwater enters the till is represented by a constant inflow \n\nboundary at the bottom of the modelled domain (cell coordinates: X= 20 m, Y= 0 m), with \n\na flow rate of 0.5 L/d. The discharge area is located in the last 20 m of the top boundary, \n\nwith a constant head of 3 m (Figure 5.2). \n\n \n\n80 m 20 m\n\nDeep groundwater\n\nTill\n\nground\n\nwater\n\n3 m\n\nLegend:\n\nImpervious boundary (null flux)\n\nDeep groundwater inflow (0.5 L/d)\n\nImpervious boundary (null flux)\n\nDeep groundwater inflow (0.5 L/d)\n\nTill groundwater inflow (14.5 L/d)\n\nDischarge area (constant head of 3 m)\n\nExpected groundwater flow direction\n\nTill groundwater inflow (14.5 L/d)\n\nDischarge area (constant head of 3 m)\n\nExpected groundwater flow direction\n \n\nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Boundary conditions for the numerical model of the till domain. \n\n \n\nTwo groundwater compositions, representative of the till and deep granitic groundwater, \n\nwere selected from SKB\u2019s database (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006), and implemented in \n\nthe numerical simulations (Table 5.3). The composition of deep groundwater affected by \n\nrepository release is modified with respect to the deep groundwater composition prior to \n\nrepository release, by adding repository-derived radionuclides (\nRD\n\nSr, \nRD\n\nCs, \nRD\n\nU and Ra, \n\nTable 5.3).

After attaining the geochemical quasi-steady \n\nstate, repository release is simulated (for additional 8000 years) by adding \nRD\n\nU, \nRD\n\nSr, \nRD\n\nCs \n\nand Ra to the deep groundwater that is flowing through the modelled domain (according \n\nto the values listed in Table 5.3). \n\nRepository release is simulated according to a very pessimistic scenario, where the \n\n~500 m of granitic bedrock (between the repository and the Quaternary till), and the \n\nengineered barriers of the repository are assumed to have a negligible retention capacity \n\nover radionuclides, which is highly unlikely. Repository release is simulated through a \n\ncontinuous inflow of repository-derived radionuclides into the Quaternary till. In this \n\ncontext, radionuclide concentrations calculated for the near-field of the repository (Duro et \n\nal., 2006b), i.e., the vicinity of the canisters that contain the HLNW, are applied directly as \n\nthe input concentrations in the numerical simulations. Following this procedure, the \n\nconcentrations of repository-derived radionuclides assigned to the deep groundwater, \n\nafter repository release, are shown in Table 5.3. These radionuclide concentrations are \n\nvery high, considering that the engineered barriers and granitic bedrock should be able to \n\nretain much of these radionuclides. Nevertheless, since the objective of this study is to \n\nevaluate radionuclide retention in the Quaternary till, such an extreme (pessimistic) \n\nscenario has been assumed. \n\n \n\n5.3.3 Spatial and time discretisation \n\nThe spatial discretisation of the modelled domain was set according to the main features \n\nof the boundary conditions which influence groundwater flow and geochemistry. \n\nAccordingly, spatial discretisation was refined at the position of the deep groundwater \n\ninflow and under the discharge area (outflow boundary). \n\nAs detailed in the previous section, there are two important stages regarding the chemical \n\ncondition of the system: (i) the first stage occurs at the beginning of the simulation, when \n\nradionuclide-free deep groundwater flows into the modelled domain and triggers major \n\ngeochemical changes until the geochemical quasi-steady state is reached (at 2700 years), \n\nand (ii) the second stage occurs when the increased concentration of radionuclides in the \n\ndeep groundwater (that simulates repository release) disturbs the previous geochemical \n\n\n\nV. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models \n\n139 \n\nstate. According to these stages, time discretisation was refined at the beginning of each \n\nstage, and set progressively coarser towards the end of each stage. \n\nTo ensure stability in the numerical calculations, the Peclet criterion (Pe?2) is met for the \n\nmaximum ?X (maximum ?X =1 m, and longitudinal dispersivity = 0.5 m). \n\n \n\n5.4 Results from the reactive solute transport model \n\n5.4.1 Transport of a conservative solute \n\nThe transport of solutes in the modelled domain is affected by the geochemical processes \n\nand groundwater flow generated from the prescribed initial and boundary conditions.

From the chlorine breakthrough curve computed at the \n\ndischarge area, an advective travel time of 2.3 years is obtained, from the deep \n\ngroundwater inflow point to the discharge area of the modelled domain. \n\n \n\n0\n\n1.00E-02\n\n2.00E-02\n\n[Cl] (mol/L)\n\nDeep groundwater\n\nTill\n\nground\n\nwater\n\n0 4 8 12 16\nTime (years)\n\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n[C\nl]\n n\n\no\nrm\n\na\nli\ns\ne\n\nd\n*\n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 Computed concentration of Cl(aq) in the modelled domain at the transport \n\nsteady state, and computed breakthrough curve at the discharge area of the modelled \n\ndomain (node X= 80 m, Y= 3 m). *[Cl] normalised stands for: ([Cl(aq)]predicted \u2013 [Cl(aq)]initial)/ \n\n([Cl(aq)]final \u2013 [Cl(aq)]initial). \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n140 \n\n5.4.2 Distribution coefficient (Kd) of radionuclides and their natural \n\nisotopes \n\nWhile chlorine behaves conservatively other elements (also known as reactive solutes), \n\nincluding the studied radionuclides and their natural isotopes, are expected to react with \n\nthe minerals present in the solid matrix of the Quaternary till which leads to their \n\npartitioning between aqueous and solid phases. Partitioning of a given reactive solute in \n\nthe modelled domain can be expressed by a Kd value that is calculated from the \n\nnumerical results. \n\nThe concentration of a given reactive solute in the solid phase and in the aqueous phase \n\nis computed by PHAST for every time writing step and every node of the modelled \n\ndomain.

Since natural \n\n\n\nV. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models \n\n141 \n\nradium is below detection limit in most of the water samples at Forsmark, the presence of \n\nthis radionuclide in the modelled domain is exclusively related to repository release. \n\nAs previously mentioned, repository-derived radionuclides have been labelled as \nRD\n\nU, \n\nRD\nSr and \n\nRD\nCs to distinguish them from their natural isotopes in the modelled domain. This \n\nlabelling procedure has been done by duplicating the thermodynamic database of each \n\nnatural isotope for the corresponding labelled radionuclide, and by defining new ideal solid \n\nsolutions that incorporate both the repository-derived radionuclide and its natural isotope, \n\nso that no artificial isotopic fractionation is introduced in the simulations. Therefore, from \n\nthe moment when repository release is simulated, the Kd of each natural isotope (U, Sr, \n\nCs) is equal to that of the corresponding repository-derived radionuclide (\nRD\n\nU, \nRD\n\nSr, \nRD\n\nCs, \n\nrespectively). \n\nDuring the approach to the geochemical quasi-steady state, the inflow of radionuclide-free \n\ndeep groundwater into the Quaternary till triggers major geochemical changes which, in \n\nturn, lead to a readjustment of the partitioning of reactive solutes between solid and \n\naqueous phases. Consequently, the Kd calculated from the outputs of the reactive \n\ntransport simulations changes over time and space. Nevertheless, after the approach to \n\nthe geochemical quasi-steady state (2700 years of reactive transport), the Kd of the \n\nselected radionuclides is relatively stable in time, but it is not homogeneous in space \n\n(Figure 5.4, Figure 5.5, Figure 5.6, and Figure 5.7). \n\nUranium is initially present in the modelled domain, in the till porewater and adsorbed on \n\nthe surface of ferrihydrite. Partitioning of uranium between aqueous and solid phases in \n\nthe Quaternary till leads to an initially homogeneous Kd(U) of 114 L\u00b7kg\n-1\n (results not \n\nshown). During the first 5 years of reactive transport simulation a dilution of U(aq) occurs \n\nbecause the deep groundwater has a lower uranium concentration than that of the till \n\nporewater (Table 5.3). This dilution causes the initial increment of the Kd(U) in the \n\nmodelled domain (darker green area in the top image of Figure 5.4). Thereafter, the Kd(U) \n\nprogressively decreases, and the resulting till domain becomes heterogeneous with a \n\nKd(U) that ranges from 114 L\u00b7kg\n-1\n, close to the till groundwater inflow area (left border of \n\nthe modelled domain), to 90 L\u00b7kg\n-1\n in the vicinity of the deep groundwater inflow point. \n\nFrom the moment when repository release is simulated, the Kd of both natural and \n\nrepository derived uranium is the same, since no isotopic fractionation is considered in the \n\nsimulations. \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n142 \n\nDeep groundwater\n\nTill\n\nground\n\nwater\n\nDeep groundwater\n\nwith repository-derived radionuclides\n\nTill\n\nground\n\nwater\n\nDeep groundwater\n\nwith repository-derived radionuclides\n\nTill\n\nground\n\nwater\n\n5 years\n\n2700 years (geochemical quasi-steady state)\n\n10,700 years (8000 years after repository release)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nX (m)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nY\n (m\n\n)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nX (m)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nY\n (m\n\n)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nX (m)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nY\n (m\n\n)\n\nKd(U) (L/kg)\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 \u2013 Predicted evolution of Kd(U) along the simulation time.

Mixing \n\nbetween both waters in the modelled domain leads to an enrichment of strontium in illite \n\nand in the (Ca,Sr)CO3 solid solution.

In the reactive transport simulations, migration of repository-derived \n\nradionuclides is affected by their interaction with the reactive minerals in the modelled \n\ndomain, while in the conservative transport simulations all reactive solutes, including \n\nrepository-derived radionuclides, are simulated as conservative solutes, meaning that \n\ntheir interaction with the reactive minerals is neglected. The comparison between both \n\nsimulations relies on the analysis of the breakthrough curves computed in each simulation \n\n(conservative and reactive transport) at the discharge area of the modelled domain \n\n(Figure 5.8). \n\nWhen reactive transport is simulated, \nRD\n\nU is predicted to be retained in the Quaternary till \n\nby adsorption on ferrihydrite. In this case, the arrival of \nRD\n\nU to the discharge area is \n\ndelayed approximately 2190 years with respect to its arrival when no interaction with the \n\nsolid phase is considered (Figure 5.8a). The delay lag is calculated by subtracting the \n\nadvective travel time computed in the reactive transport model to that computed in the \n\nconservative transport model. \n\nIn the reactive transport simulation, approximately 1000 years after repository release, the \n\nconcentration of \nRD\n\nSr(aq), at the discharge area of the modelled domain, reaches a \n\nstationary value of 3.0 \u00d7 10\n-5\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n (Figure 5.8b). The retention of \n\nRD\nSr in the Quaternary \n\ntill delays its arrival to the discharge area approximately 350 years. The computed \n\nretention of \nRD\n\nSr is provided by cation exchange in illite and, to a less extent, to its co-\n\nprecipitation with calcite. \n\nThe breakthrough curve computed for \nRD\n\nCs in the reactive transport simulation (Figure \n\n5.8c) shows a remarkably slow tendency towards a stable maximum value. This slow \n\nincrease of the concentration of \nRD\n\nCs(aq) at the discharge area of the Quaternary till is \n\ndue to the high affinity of caesium for the FES of illite which readily retain \nRD\n\nCs in the solid \n\nphase of the modelled domain. \n\nDeep groundwater affected by repository release has a radium concentration of 9.15 \u00d7 10\n-\n\n11\n mol\u00b7L\n\n-1\n. At the end of the reactive transport simulation, Ra(aq) concentration computed \n\nfor the discharge area is 2.43 \u00d7 10\n-12\n\n mol\u00b7L\n-1\n, which is 74% of the maximum Ra(aq) \n\nconcentration computed in the conservative transport simulation (Figure 5.8d). The \n\n\n\nV. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models \n\n147 \n\nnumerical results predict that radium is retained, via co-precipitation with barite, in the \n\nvicinity of the deep groundwater inflow point (Figure 5.7). \n\nFrom the four radionuclides studied, radium is the only radionuclide that is solely \n\ninfluenced by the precipitation of a mineral phase (i.e. it is not involved in sorption \n\nreactions). Co-precipitation of radium with barite leads to an asymptotic breakthrough \n\ncurve which is typical for those solutes solely influenced by the thermodynamic equilibrium \n\nwith a mineral phase. This behaviour leads to a very slow increase of Ra(aq) at the final \n\nstage of the reactive transport simulation (Figure 5.8d). \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\n\nTime after repository release (years)\n\n0.0E+000\n\n2.0E-010\n\n4.0E-010\n\n6.0E-010\n\n[R\nD\nU\n\n] \n(m\n\no\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\n(b) \n\n0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\n\nTime after repository release (years)\n\n0.0E+000\n\n1.0E-005\n\n2.0E-005\n\n3.0E-005\n\n[R\nD\nS\n\nr]\n (\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\n(c) \n\n0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\n\nTime after repository release (years)\n\n1.0E-013\n\n1.0E-012\n\n1.0E-011\n\n1.0E-010\n\n1.0E-009\n\n1.0E-008\n\n[R\nD\nC\n\ns\n] \n(m\n\no\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\n(d) \n\n0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\n\nTime after repository release (years)\n\n0.0E+000\n\n2.0E-012\n\n4.0E-012\n\n6.0E-012\n\n8.0E-012\n\n1.0E-011\n\n[R\na\n\n] \n(m\n\no\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 5.8 \u2013 Computed breakthrough curves at the discharge area of the modelled domain \n\n(node X= 80 m; Y= 3 m, see Figure 5.3) for repository-derived radionuclides, considering the \n\ngeochemical reactions that affect radionuclide mobility (reactive transport, red line) and \n\nwithout considering any geochemical reaction (conservative transport, black line). \n\n \n\n5.5 Retardation factor (R) of repository-derived radionuclides \n\nThe retardation factor (R) of a given reactive solute can be estimated from the numerical \n\nresults according to two alternative procedures. If the computed breakthrough curve of a \n\nreactive solute (including the selected radionuclides) is complete, than R can be \n\ncalculated from the following equation: \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n148 \n\nC\n\nR\n\nT\n\nT\nR\n\n2/1\n\n2/1?                                                                                                       (equation 5.3) \n\n \n\nwhere T\nR\n\n1/2 is the advective travel time of the reactive solute in the reactive transport \n\nsimulation, and T\nC\n\n1/2 is the advective travel time of the same solute in the conservative \n\ntransport simulation. Equation 5.3 can be applied to estimate R for \nRD\n\nU and \nRD\n\nSr, for which \n\ncomplete breakthrough curves have been computed. By applying equation 5.3 we obtain \n\nan effective retardation factor of 956 for \nRD\n\nU and 156 for \nRD\n\nSr. \n\nIf the breakthrough curve of a reactive solute is not complete (i.e., the maximum stabilized \n\nconcentration has not been reached, as for the case of \nRD\n\nCs and Ra), equation 5.3 cannot \n\nbe used to calculate R. In this case, and assuming a fully water saturated porous media \n\n(such as the Quaternary till modelled here), and that the geochemical reactions between \n\nreactive solutes and the solid matrix occur as a singular and instantaneous process (such \n\nas the local thermodynamic equilibrium reactions simulated here), R can be calculated \n\nfrom the following equation that relates R with Kde: \n\ne\n\nb\ne\n\nKdR\n?\n\n?\n???1                                                                                        (equation 5.4) \n\n \n\nwhere Kde is the effective distribution coefficient [L\n-3\n\nM], ?b is the dry bulk density of the \n\nsediment [M L\n-3\n], and ?? is the effective porosity (-). \n\nIn case of incomplete breakthrough curves (\nRD\n\nCs and Ra in this work), equation 5.4 \n\nshould provide the approach to calculate the corresponding R. Nevertheless, when \n\napplying equation 5.4 to calculate R one must have a single value for Kde and ?? which is \n\nnot the case presented here; both these parameters are heterogeneous, as shown in \n\nsection 5.4.2 and Table 5.1, respectively. \n\nIn order to find an effective porosity for the studied Quaternary till a conservative transport \n\nmodel was built using FEFLOW (Diersch, 2005). This model was calibrated using the \n\nvalues of the hydraulic parameters shown in Table 5.1, and adjusting a single effective \n\nporosity for the whole modelled domain that leads to the same conservative advective \n\ntravel time as the one attained in the conservative transport model built in PHAST (Figure \n\n5.3). The effective porosity attained from this calibration is 0.0789, which is approximately \n\n\n\nV.

This effective porosity is equivalent to the \n\nweighted average of the layered kinematic porosities that characterize the till deposit \n\n(Table 5.1). Now, the Kde for \nRD\n\nU and \nRD\n\nSr (for which we have calculated R) must be \n\nfound, and its mathematical meaning will be assessed, in order to provide a quantitative \n\ntool to calculate the effective Kd for \nRD\n\nCs and Ra. Re-writing equation 5.3 to obtain the \n\nKde, the following equation is obtained: \n\n \nb\n\ne\ne\n\nRKd\n?\n\n?\n)1( ??

This apparent \n\ndiscrepancy is due to the fact that the Kd obtained for the modelled domain, was \n\ncalculated applying equation 5.2 which uses the total porosity (0.25) instead of the \n\neffective porosity (0.0789). These results reflect that as for porosity, where: \n\n1. the kinematic porosity is related to the interconnected porous that contribute to the \n\ntransport of solutes; and, \n\n2. the total porosity accounts for all isolated and interconnected voids, \n\n \n\nfor Kd, it seems that a Kd related to the bulk of the sediment (total Kd), and a Kd only \n\navailable for the transport of solutes (kinematic Kd) should exist. \n\nIf the effective porosity is applied in equation 5.2, to calculate the Kd in the modelled \n\ndomain, the spatial distribution of kinematic Kd for the four radionuclides selected is \n\nobtained (Figure 5.10). The effective Kd previously calculated for \nRD\n\nSr (6.27 L\u00b7kg\n-1\n) falls in \n\nthe range of kinematic Kd\u2019s calculated for the modelled domain (3 to 7 L\u00b7kg\n-1\n, in Figure \n\n5.10), while the effective Kd previously calculated for \nRD\n\nU (38.6 L\u00b7kg\n-1\n) is slightly higher \n\nthan the maximum kinematic Kd (36 L\u00b7kg\n-1\n, in Figure 5.10). \n\nThese results show that opposite to what was found for porosity, where the effective \n\nporosity is the weighted average of the kinematic porosities, it seems that the effective Kd \n\nmay not be related to the range of kinematic Kd\u2019s by any statistic parameter. With these \n\nresults we still cannot find a reliable way to calculate R for those radionuclides for which \n\nincomplete breakthrough curves have been computed. This would lead us to the ultimate \n\noption of computing longer time periods of reactive transport to achieve the complete \n\nbreakthrough curves for \nRD\n\nCs and Ra. Since this is not the purpose of the present work, \n\nthe breakthrough curves computed in the reactive transport model with those computed in \n\nKd-based models for \nRD\n\nSr and \nRD\n\nU (for which we have complete breakthrough curves) will \n\nbe compared, and the validity of R and respective Kde, calculated from the outputs of the \n\nreactive transport simulations, will be assessed. \n\n \n\n\n\nV.

Therefore, when the system is in a geochemical quasi-\n\nsteady state, as the one previously built prior to the simulation of repository release, a Kd-\n\nbased model can be as reliable as a reactive transport model.  \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n0 400 800 1200\nTime after repository failure (years)\n\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n[R\nD\nS\n\nr]\n n\n\no\nrm\n\na\nli\ns\ne\n\nd\n\n \n\n(b) \n\n0 400 800 1200\nTime after repository failure (years)\n\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n[R\nD\nS\n\nr]\n n\n\no\nrm\n\na\nli\ns\ne\n\nd\n\n \n\nFigure 5.11 \u2013 Computed breakthrough curves for \nRD\n\nSr normalised.

The migration and \n\nretention of \nRD\n\nU, \nRD\n\nSr, \nRD\n\nCs and Ra through a Quaternary till that covers the candidate \n\nhost rock at Forsmark (Sweden) have been assessed. The outputs of the reactive \n\ntransport model show that the four radionuclides can be retained in the solid phase of the \n\nQuaternary till due to different geochemical processes: \nRD\n\nU is adsorbed on ferrihydrite; \n\nRD\nSr is retained via co-precipitation with calcite and cation exchange on illite; \n\nRD\nCs is also \n\nretained via cation exchange on illite; and, radium is retained via co-precipitation with \n\nbarite. Retention of the radionuclides in the solid phase provides a retardation of their \n\narrival to the discharge area of the Quaternary till. \n\nThe retardation factor of the radionuclides studied has been calculated, from the outputs \n\nof the reactive transport model, only for those radionuclides for which complete \n\nbreakthrough curves have been computed (strontium and uranium). The estimation of the \n\nretardation factor for caesium and radium was not possible, since complete breakthrough \n\ncurves have not been achieved. The high affinity of caesium for the FES of illite, and the \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n154 \n\nfact that radium is solely involved in co-precipitation reactions, delay the achievement of a \n\ncomplete breakthrough curve, and therefore, hinder the estimation of the corresponding \n\nretardation factor. \n\nThe validity of the retardation factor calculated for uranium and strontium, from the outputs \n\nof the reactive transport model, has been assessed by developing Kd-based models that \n\naccounted for the retardation factor so obtained. \n\nIn order to build the Kd-based models, the naturally stratified kinematic porosity had to be \n\nupscaled to an effective porosity which corresponds to the weighted average of the \n\nkinematic porosities. As for porosity, it has been proven that for Kd there is a total Kd and \n\na kinematic Kd. The retardation factor of a reactive solute is related to an effective Kd \n\nwhich, in turn, is closer to the range of kinematic Kd\u2019s than to the range of total Kd\u2019s. In \n\nother words, it is the kinematic Kd the one responsible for the retardation of the transport \n\nof reactive solutes. In the present work, it has been proven that the kinematic Kd is usually \n\nlower than the total Kd. These results have a deep impact on the laboratory methods that \n\nare used to obtain a Kd value to be implemented in Kd-based models for performance \n\nassessment exercises. \n\nAs Reardon (1981) had concluded, we have demonstrated that when a given system \n\nreaches a geochemical quasi-steady state, a Kd-based model is able to provide numerical \n\nresults as reliable as those attained in an equivalent reactive transport model. It should be \n\nnoted, however, that the solution method selected for the reactive transport model may \n\nintroduce additional numerical dispersion that is not computed in a Kd-based model. \n\nFinally, care must be taken when choosing the type of model to evaluate long-term \n\ncontamination scenarios, since most likely these will undergo geochemical changes that \n\nare better coped in reactive transport numerical models than in Kd-based numerical \n\nmodels. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work has been funded by SKB.

Summary, conclusions and discussion \n\n \n\n6.1 Summary and Conclusions \n\nThe main geochemical processes that influence the migration of radionuclides in near-\n\nsurface systems have been studied in the present work.  \n\nHydrogeochemical numerical models have been developed to simulate both laboratory \n\nand field scale multicomponent problems. These simulations provided the assessment \n\nand quantification of the processes that are likely to influence the behaviour of \n\nradionuclides in near-surface systems. The numerical models developed here are based \n\non two hydrogeochemical codes: PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) and PHAST \n\n(Parkhurst et al., 2004). The first code is widely used for at least a decade, in the context \n\nof different environmental and scientific issues, while the second code is not so \n\nwidespread but it results from coupling the first code with a transport code (HST3D, Kipp, \n\n1987). Therefore, the code PHAST is useful when dealing with complex geochemical \n\nsystems coupled with the transport of solutes such as the ones studies here, and also \n\nwhen the problem cannot be reduced to 1D. Finally, in Chapter 5 a third code has been \n\nused (FEFLOW, Diersch, 2005) to compare Kd-based transport models with the reactive \n\ntransport models previously developed using PHAST (Parkhurst et al., 2004). \n\nA descriptive numerical model has been developed in Chapter 2 of this thesis to simulate \n\na jar-fermentor experiment where evidences of microbially driven redox reactions have \n\nbeen observed. \n\nMicrobially driven redox reactions are interpreted as the oxidation of organic carbon by \n\nmicrobes, and subsequent reduction of inorganic species that are available in the \n\nsurrounding aquatic system. The linkage between microbial activity and the redox \n\nsensitive species has been conceptualized through the partial equilibrium approach (Barry \n\net al., 2002; Brun and Engesgaard, 2002) which assumes that the rate limiting step is the \n\noxidation of organic matter, and that the subsequent reduction of inorganic species occurs \n\nunder local equilibrium. In the present work, this approach has been successfully applied \n\nto the reduction of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, sulphate, ferric iron, and fermentation of \n\nlactate, mediated by aerobes, denitrifiers, sulphate reducing bacteria, iron reducing \n\nbacteria, and fermenters, respectively, but not to microbially driven methanogenesis.  \n\nBesides the partial equilibrium approach, the Monod growth model was also applied in \n\nChapter 2, to simulate microbial respiration and growth, taking into account, half-\n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n160 \n\nsaturation constants for the organic and inorganic substrates, and also inhibition terms \n\nthat describe the sequential use of terminal electron acceptors (O(II), N(V), Fe(III), S(VI), \n\nacetate and C(VI)). Coupling of the partial equilibrium approach with the Monod growth \n\nmodel seems to provide a solid theoretical basis, able to accurately describe microbially \n\ndriven redox reactions. In addition, by considering that when microbial biomass grows, the \n\nelements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are removed from solution according to \n\nthe stoichiometry of a simplified biomass molecule (C5H7O2N) and vice-versa, a robust \n\nmass balance between biomass and the different phases (solid, aqueous and gaseous) of \n\nthe inorganic aquatic system of the jar-fermentor has been achieved. \n\nThe numerical results achieved in Chapter 2 prove that, if microbes and organic matter \n\nare available at repository depth, dissolved oxygen, one of the most damaging species for \n\na metallic over pack, may be consumed relatively fast, while HS\n-\n (which may also corrode \n\nthe metallic over pack) may be produced by sulphate reducing bacteria. Nevertheless, \n\nsulphur secondary phases may precipitate and limit the concentration of HS\n-\n. \n\nUncertainties on the Monod parameters provide the possibility for different combinations \n\nof these parameters which lead to similar numerical solutions. Nevertheless, these \n\ndifferent combinations of the Monod parameters lead to different partitioning of carbon \n\nbetween biomass and the different phases of the inorganic carbon system (aqueous, \n\nsolid, and gaseous). Should more variables be analysed in future experiments, such as \n\nthe concentration of Ca\n2+\n\n, the amount of carbonate minerals, and the initial and final \n\nconcentration of the different microbial groups, some uncertainties on the Monod \n\nparameters could be constrained. \n\nTwo predictive numerical models have been developed in Chapters 3 and 4, to assess the \n\nretention capacity of the near-surface systems at Forsmark (Sweden) under a pessimistic \n\nscenario of repository release and subsequent arrival of radionuclides to the near-surface \n\nQuaternary sediments (glacial clay and calcite-rich till). Comparison between the outputs \n\nof the numerical models developed for the glacial clay and the calcite-rich till with \n\nmeasured concentrations of reactive solutes such as bicarbonate, calcium, strontium and \n\nuranium, has proven the reliability of the conceptual model built for these systems. Under \n\nthis premise, a hypothetical repository release has been simulated through a continuous \n\ninjection of repository-derived radionuclides into both Quaternary sediments. The outputs \n\nof this hypothetical repository release into the Quaternary sediments have provided a \n\nquantitative assessment of the capacity of the glacial clay and the calcite-rich till to retain \n\nthe four radionuclides selected: \n235\n\nU, \n90\n\nSr, \n135\n\nCs and \n226\n\nRa. \n\n\n\nVI. Summary, Conclusions and Discussion \n\n161 \n\nTaking into account the knowledge attained from the data gathered until now, and under \n\nthe assumptions made for each near-surface system, it is possible to conclude that the \n\nfour radionuclides studied are likely to be efficiently retained in the till and glacial clay for \n\nat least several hundreds of years. Exception is made for radium in the glacial clay where \n\nit seems that it could be mobile. \n\nFinally, it has been seen in Chapter 5 that the Kd of reactive solutes may vary over time \n\nand space. Nevertheless, when the geochemical quasi-steady state is approached in the \n\nnumerical model, effective Kd\u2019s may be calculated from the outputs of such numerical \n\nmodel. The validity of these effective Kd\u2019s has been assessed in Kd-based transport \n\nmodels developed in FEFLOW (Diersch, 2005). In order to build these Kd-based models, \n\nthe naturally stratified kinematic porosity had to be upscaled to an effective porosity which \n\ncorresponds to the weighted average of the kinematic porosities. As for porosity, it has \n\nbeen proven that also for Kd there is a total Kd and a kinematic Kd. \n\nThe retardation factor of a reactive solute is related to an effective Kd which in turn is \n\ncloser to the range of kinematic Kd\u2019s than to the range of total Kd\u2019s. These results have a \n\ndeep impact on the laboratory methods that are used to obtain a Kd value to be \n\nimplemented in Kd-based models within performance assessment exercises. \n\nThe laboratory methods performed to calculate the Kd of a given radionuclide are often \n\nbased on batch experiments. The Kd calculated from such experiments corresponds to \n\nthe total Kd, and this total Kd is higher than the kinematic Kd that would be obtained from \n\na column experiment. Total Kd would then lead to the estimation of a longer advective \n\ntravel time of a given radionuclide compared with the travel time obtained if the kinematic \n\nKd would be used. By considering a longer travel time than the one that could actually be \n\nobserved, the safety assessment based on total Kd\u2019s would lead to less conservative \n\npredictions. Therefore, in the context of safety assessment, it is recommended to study \n\nthe kinematic Kd\u2019s instead of the total Kd\u2019s. \n\n \n\n6.2 Discussion \n\nThe work presented has contributed to improve our understanding on the \n\n(bio)geochemical and hydrodynamic processes that influence radionuclide mobility in \n\nnear-surface systems. The numerical implementation of the conceptual models built for \n\neach case has been accurately developed. Despite the successful results attained in each \n\nnumerical model, some unsolved problems still exist, some of which provide ideas for \n\nfuture works, others can be viewed as weak points of this thesis, and others reflect the \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n162 \n\nneed for further development in computational power or more efficient numerical models, \n\nand additional thermodynamic data. \n\nIn the next paragraphs the main unsolved questions that prevail after the development of \n\nthe research work described in Chapters 2 to 5 are discussed. \n\n \n\n6.2.1 Chapter 2: lactate fermentation and the inorganic carbon system \n\nIn Chapter 2, propionate evolution is still not well understood and consequently not well \n\nsimulated. The stoichiometry of lactate fermentation implemented here has been reported \n\nby others (von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993, among others). Nevertheless, the most probable \n\ncause for overestimation of propionate seems to be an apparently unsuitable \n\nstoichiometry of lactate fermentation for the jar-fermentor experiment modelled here. \n\nThese results point to the hypothesis that lactate fermentation could vary depending on \n\nthe environment in which it takes place. \n\nMethane production is far overestimated, while for carbon dioxide the opposite is true. The \n\nmost probable reason for the overestimation of methane could be due to the fact that, as \n\nfor the other types of microbial respiration considered in the numerical model, microbial \n\nmethanogenesis is simulated following the partial equilibrium approach. Under this \n\npremise, the local equilibrium reaction that describes the reduction of C(IV) to C(-IV) has \n\nbeen maintained in the thermodynamic database. By doing so, the numerical model \n\ncomputes an excess of methane production.  An alternative to this assumption would be \n\nthat methane could be solely produced through kinetics. Nevertheless, under this \n\nalternative assumption, the change in the oxidation state of carbon, from C(IV) to C(-IV), \n\ncould not be coupled to the redox potential since this equilibrium reaction would have had \n\nto be discarded from the thermodynamic database. These uncertainties point to the \n\nfollowing questions: \n\nIs the thermodynamic constant of the reaction that describes the reduction of HCO3\n-\n to \n\nCH4: \n\nHCO3\n-\n(aq) + 9H\n\n+\n(aq) + 8e\n\n-\n ? CH4(aq) + 3H2O(l)     log k = 27.8493 \n\n (equation 6.1) \n\n \n\n, used in the numerical model, suitable in systems where microbial methanogenesis takes \n\nplace? Should a different thermodynamic constant be used when microbial \n\nmethanogenesis prevails? What would be the applicability of such constant to other \n\nsystems? \n\n\n\nVI. Summary, Conclusions and Discussion \n\n163 \n\nThe uncertainties related to methane production have inevitable consequences on the \n\naccuracy of modelled carbon dioxide production. Therefore, the simulated evolution of \n\ncarbon dioxide also shows a poor agreement with measured data. \n\nThe precipitation/dissolution of carbonate minerals should also influence the carbon \n\nsystem. Under the assumptions made for conceptual model that describes the behaviour \n\nof the carbon system, the numerical model developed in Chapter 2 fails to reproduce \n\nmethane and carbon dioxide production. As previously mentioned, future experiments with \n\nadditional measured data could help to improve our understanding on the evolution of the \n\ncarbon system in environments where microbial activity plays an important role. \n\n \n\n6.2.2 Chapter 3: geochemical behaviour of radium in the glacial clay \n\nIn Chapter 3, from the four radionuclides considered in the numerical model, radium is \n\npredicted to be mobile, i.e., it is not retained in the solid phase. In this numerical model, \n\nradium was let to co-precipitate with barite if oversaturation with this phase is reached. \n\nNevertheless, since barite oversaturation was not computed for the glacial clay modelled \n\nin Chapter 3, radium was not predicted to be retained in the solid phase of the glacial clay. \n\nShould other phases be considered to react with radium, such as barium carbonate \n\n(BaCO3), which has been reported as a feasible process by others (Andrews et al., 1989), \n\nradium could have been predicted to be retained in the glacial clays at Forsmark. \n\n \n\n6.2.3 Chapters 3 and 4: coupling of wider and more complex geological \n\nsettings \n\nLooking at the work presented in Chapters 3 and 4, one could ask: Why were the glacial \n\nclay and till systems, which are by nature hydraulically connected, modelled separately? \n\nCould they have been integrated in a single and more complex numerical model? Most \n\nprobably yes. In fact, during the construction of the reactive transport numerical models, \n\nwe have tried to couple both sediments in a single numerical model. Nevertheless, some \n\ndifficulties have arisen related to both the conceptualization and the numerical \n\nimplementation of the hydrodynamic and geochemical processes responsible for the \n\ndifferentiation between both sediments. Therefore, for the time being, both sediments \n\nhave been modelled separately. \n\nFollowing the reasoning of the previous paragraph, one could ask if the whole system, \n\nfrom the deep geological repository, passing through the ~500 m of granite, to the near-\n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n164 \n\nsurface systems, could have been simulated in a single reactive transport model, and \n\ntherefore more accurate predictions could have been made. I might say that human \n\nactions tend to augment the range of possible things and these depend on the time at \n\nwhich a question to be solved is posed and the schedule that one has to face to give the \n\nanswer. I would say it is possible, and theoretically, such a complex hydrogeochemical \n\nmodel is nearing its accomplishment. \n\nIn addition to the geochemical processes that have been implemented in the numerical \n\nsimulations developed in Chapters 3 and 4, other geochemical processes could influence \n\nradionuclide migration in the glacial clay and till sediments. Nevertheless, uncertainties on \n\n(1) site specific data, (2) the mechanisms inherent to the geochemical processes, and (3) \n\nthe lack of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters hinder the implementation of additional \n\ngeochemical processes. \n\nThe additional geochemical processes relevant for the glacial clay and till sediments that \n\ncould be implemented in future works are: \n\n\u2022 Microbial activity. The work developed in Chapter 2 has proven the role of \n\nmicrobial activity on the redox state of aquatic systems, and therefore, the mobility \n\nof redox sensitive radionuclides such as uranium may be remarkably modified in \n\nthe presence of microbial activity. \n\n\u2022 Sorption on organic tissues. The glacial clays at Forsmark may have organic \n\nmatter-rich layers (Tr\u00f6jbom and S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, 2006) where sorption of radionuclides \n\non solid organic matter could be a relevant process for the cycling of radionuclides \n\nin near-surface systems (Hou et al., 2003). \n\n\u2022 Colloid-borne radionuclide transport. Colloid-borne radionuclide transport may be a \n\nrelevant process on the migration of radionuclides (van de Weerd and Leijnse, \n\n1997). Nevertheless, the uncertainties related to the mechanisms that underlie the \n\nradionuclide attachment to colloid particles and subsequent colloid mobility hinder \n\nthe simulation of the interaction between radionuclides and colloids. \n\n \n\n6.2.4 Chapters 3 and 4: reliability of the numerical predictions \n\nThe final question I would pose to the work presented here is how reliable are the \n\npredictive models developed for the near-surface systems at Forsmark. We have \n\nperformed long periods of reactive transport to reproduce the hydrogeochemical \n\nconditions observed nowadays at Forsmark, the outputs of which have shown a relatively \n\ngood agreement with observed data; namely, the molar ratio between bicarbonate and \n\n\n\nVI. Summary, Conclusions and Discussion \n\n165 \n\nuranium, and the molar ratio between calcium and strontium in the aqueous phase, \n\ncomputed in the numerical models developed in Chapters 3 and 4, fall within the range of \n\ndata actually measured at Forsmark. Therefore, if the topography and hydrology of the \n\nForsmark area will not change much for the next ~2500 years, the numerical predictions \n\nmade here can be viewed as relatively reliable under the pessimistic scenario that has \n\nbeen assumed. \n\n \n\n6.2.5 Chapter 5: uncertainties on the parameterization of solute transport \n\nIn Chapter 5, the reliability of Kd-based models compared to reactive transport models \n\nhas been assessed. This work has proven that only when the system is under \n\ngeochemical quasi-steady state conditions, Kd-based models can provide as reliable \n\nestimates as reactive transport models. Nevertheless, uncertainties on the Kd value to be \n\napplied in Kd-based models must be assessed through proper sensitivity analyses. On the \n\nother hand, in reactive transport models, uncertainties related to the values of effective \n\ndiffusion coefficients, longitudinal and transverse dispersivities also apportion additional \n\nuncertainties to the results of reactive transport models. In this context, future sensitivity \n\nanalyses on the magnitude of these parameters should be performed to assess the \n\ninfluence of these parameters on the predictions for radionuclide mobility in near-surface \n\nsystems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n166 \n\n6.3 References \n\nAndrews J.N., Ford D.J., Hussain N., Trivedi D., Youngman M.J.

(1994). This model considers two types of \n\nadsorption sites (of strong and weak binding, respectively). The adsorbable species and \n\ncorresponding constants are listed in Table A1.3. The total concentration of sites is 0.875 \n\nmol per mol of ferrihydrite (Waite et al., 1994). Most of these sites are of low affinity (weak \n\nbinding) and only 0.0018 mol per mol of ferrihydrite correspond to high-affinity (strong \n\nbinding) sites. \n\n\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n169 \n\n \n\nTable A1.3 \u2013 Complexation reactions on ferrihydrite surface and corresponding \n\nthermodynamic constants (from Waite et al., 1994). \n\nReaction Log K (25\u00baC) \n\nStrong sites   (1.8 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n molsite\u00b7molFe(OH)3\n-1\n\n) \n\n?HFO\ns\nOH + H\n\n+\n  ? ?HFO\n\ns\nOH\n\n2+\n 6.51 \n\n?HFO\ns\nOH ? ?HFO\n\ns\nO\n\n-\n + H\n\n+\n -9.13 \n\n?HFO\ns\nOH + UO2\n\n2+\n  ? ?(HFO\n\ns\nO)2UO2 + 2H\n\n+\n -2.57 \n\n?HFO\ns\nOH + UO2\n\n2+\n  + CO3\n\n2-\n? ?(HFO\n\ns\nO)2UO2CO3\n\n2-\n+ 2H\n\n+\n 3.67 \n\n?HFO\ns\nOH + CO3\n\n2-\n + 2H\n\n+\n? ?HFO\n\ns\nCO3H + H2O 19.50 \n\n?HFO\ns\nOH + CO3\n\n2-\n + H\n\n+\n? ?HFO\n\ns\nCO\n\n3-\n + H2O 11.51 \n\nWeak sites   (0.875 molsite\u00b7molFe(OH)3\n-1\n\n) \n\n?HFO\nw\nOH + H\n\n+\n  ? ?HFO\n\nw\nOH\n\n2+\n 6.51 \n\n?HFO\nw\nOH ? ?HFO\n\nw\nO\n\n-\n + H\n\n+\n -9.13 \n\n?HFO\nw\nOH + UO2\n\n2+\n  ? ?(HFO\n\nw\nO)2UO\n\n2\n + 2H\n\n+\n -6.28 \n\n?HFO\nw\nOH + UO2\n\n2+\n  + CO3\n\n2-\n? ?(HFO\n\nw\nO)2UO2CO3\n\n2-\n+ 2H\n\n+\n -0.42 \n\n?HFO\nw\nOH + CO3\n\n2-\n + 2H\n\n+\n? ?HFO\n\nw\nCO3H + H2O 19.50 \n\n?HFO\nw\nOH + CO3\n\n2-\n + H\n\n+\n? ?HFO\n\nw\nCO\n\n3-\n + H2O 11.51 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNumerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems \n\n170 \n\nA1.
