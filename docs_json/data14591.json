These rocks are components of Campo Ale-\n\ngre volcanic-sedimentary basin (Citroni et al. 2001) of\n\nalmost400km2. It is aNeoproterozoic sequence (595 \u00b1\n16Ma,Cordanietal. 1999)lyingonolderArcheangran-\n\nulite terranes. Rhyolite is the most abundant lithotype\n\n(Weischel et al. 2000), but the rocks are heterogeneous:\n\ntrachytes, porphyritic rhyolites, banded rhyolites, tuffs,\n\nbreccia. The Lower Effusive Sequence is composed of\n\nbasalt and trachyte. The Intermediary Epiclastic-volca-\n\nnoclastic Sequence is made of shale and volcanogenic\n\nsedimentary and pyroclastic flow. The Upper Volcanic\n\nSequence (80% of the exposed area) of late Proterozoic\n\nage consists of trachytes and rhyolites. Pyroclastic flow\n\ndeposits are common as welded high temperature ign-\n\nimbrites (Weischel et al. 2000). Old rocks in a plateau\n\nup to \u00b11000 m above sea level, fractures and faults are\nevidences of a regional uplift (Potter 1997) in the area.\n\nThick(20-40m)depositsofclaysevolvefromthesurface\n\nrocks. Three kaolin mines in Campo Alegre Basin were\n\nstudied: Oxford (or Floresta) Mine, Incepa (or Cambu\u00ed)\n\nMine and Ceramarte Mine (Table I).\n\nCeramarte Mine (26?15?21\"S\u201349?12?55\"W) is lo-\ncated in adown-slope landscapenear thecentreofCam-\n\npo Alegre Basin. The mine is 7 to 17 meters deep and\n\nexposes differentiated levels over the alteredporphyritic\n\nrhyolite. At the base the rhyolite alters to a saprolith\n\nhorizon that maintains the rock texture; the saprock has\n\nelongated core boulders and preserves the rhyolite tex-\n\nture and veins of white clays. As the alteration evolves,\n\na network of clayey white segregations becomes denser\n\nwithinalightpinkmatrixandtherocktexturedisappears.\n\nAn oxidate facies with yellow and red spots develops in\n\nthe clay zone about 3 to 7.5 meters up. The clay zone\n\nhas anastomosingveins composedofwhite clays. Black\n\norganic soil develops over the white clays.\n\nIncepaMine (26?17?27\"S\u201349?16?48\"W) is approx-\nimately 30 m deep. At the base of the mine there are\n\nsomerelictsof therock(aphanite) inalightgreenishgray\n\nclayey matrix cut by fractures, coated with white clays.\n\nAt some points higher in the profile, the matrix shows\n\na very fine (less than 1 mm) laminated white and pale\n\nred structure with some very coarse (more than 10 mm)\n\nwhite granular structures. At the top of the sequence,\n\nlocated in a geomorphic depression, there is a 2 m thick\n\nblack-colored soil.\n\nOxford Mine (26?19?54\"S\u201349?12?50\"W) is the\nthird studied occurrence, in the south of Campo Alegre\n\nBasin. Kaolin formsfromabandedrockwithflowstruc-\n\ntureplanesalternatingwithmoreor lessclayeymaterial;\n\nalong the planes there are black coatings. Towards the\n\nsurface, the rock turns into a white to gray clay with\n\nrounded or sub-angular coarse blocky structures (up to\n\n50 cm diameter) of green clay. Veins coated with white\n\nclay cut all the matrix of the mine walls. Higher in the\n\nprofile, there is a red level (1 m thick) which is followed\n\nby an ochre level (1.5 m thick), which in turn is covered\n\nby a white clay soil with black roots.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nTwenty-six samples from the three mines were studied:\n\n7 from Incepa, 8 from Oxford and 11 from Ceramar-\n\nte Mine. They were split into sub-samples for various\n\nmethods of investigation.\n\nThin sectionsof impregnated sampleswere studied\n\nusing scanning electron microscopy.\n\nThe clay (&lt;0.002 mm) fraction of each sample\n\nwas removed after settling under gravity according to\n\nStock\u2019s Law in an aqueous solution of 33 g of sodium\n\nhexametaphosphateand7gofanhydroussodiumcarbon-\n\nate in distilled water (1 liter). Two oriented aggregates\n\nof each sample were prepared for Ba saturation and Mg\n\nsaturation.\n\nCation exchange capacity (CEC) was determined\n\nby barium saturation as described by Janik and Keeling\n\n(1996). Theorientedsamplessaturatedwithbarium(1M\n\nBaCl2) solution were washed several times with deion-\n\nized water. Then the samples were dried and analyzed\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\nA STUDY ON THE GENESIS OF KAOLIN CLAYS OF CAMPO ALEGRE BASIN 667\n\nTABLE I\n\nVisible differentiation from the walls of each mine, depth, label of the samples, color and description of the profiles.\n\nCeramarte Mine (26?15?21\"S\u201349?12?55\"W)\n\nPart of profile\nDepth Label of\n\nColor of bulk sample\nDescription\n\n(m) sample Top?Base (7 to 17 m deep)\nUpper level 0.6 CE7 White 10R8/1 Black organic soil over white clays\n\nVein 1.60 CE6C White 10R8/1 Clay zone with anastomosing veins\n\nMatrix 1.60 CE6b White 10R8/1 composed of white clays\n\nVein 1.60 CE6a White 10R8/1 An oxidate facies with yellow spots\n\nClayey level 2.70 CE5a White 10R8/1 develops in the clay zone\n\nVein of the oxidate facies 3.70 CE4acd Yellow (10YR8/6) The network of clayey white\n\nOxidate facies 3.70 CE4bm Yellow (10YR8/6) segregations becomes scarce\n\nAlterite vein 4.15 CE3av Light greenish gray (Gley8/1) within a light pink matrix\n\nAlterite 4.15 CE3bm White (2.5YR 8/1) The saprock has elongated core\n\nVein of altered rhyolite 4.80 CE2bv Very Pale Brown (10YR8/2) boulders and preserves the rhyolite\n\nAltered rhyolite 4.80 CE2am Pink (5YR 7/3) texture and veins of white clays\n\nRhyolite 6.30 CE1av White (Gley 8/N) Rhyolite\n\nAlterite 11.65 CE9 White Sample in the sequence\n\nIncepa Mine (26?17?27\"S\u201349?12?48\"W)\n\nPart of profile\nDepth Label of\n\nColor of bulk sample\nDescription geomorphic depression\n\n(m) sample Top?Base (30 m deep)\nGranular structure 4 Inc5 White (Gley 8/N) 2m thick black-colored soil covers\n\nBrittle laminated matrix 5 Inc4b White/pale red (10R 7/2) the clays\n\nLaminated matrix 5 Inc4a White/pale red (10R 7/2) Saprolite has a very fine (less than\n\nClay Matrix 7.30 Inc3 White (Gley 8/N) 1 mm) laminated white and pale\n\nGreen indurate relict 7 Inc 2b Light greenish gray (Gley8/10Y) red structure with some very\n\nGray indurate relict 7 Inc2a Light greenish gray (Gley8/10GY) coarse (more than 10 mm) white\n\nOriented veins 7 Inc 1 White (Gley 8/N) granular structures\n\nAt the base of the mine there are\n\nsome relicts of the rock (aphanite)\n\nin a light greenish gray clayey\n\nmatrix cut by fractures, coated\n\nwith white clays\n\nOxford Mine (26?19?54\"S\u201349?12?50\"W)\n\nPart of profile\nDepth Label of\n\nColor of bulk sample\nDescription\n\n(m) sample Top?Base (20 m deep)\nSoil 1 Ox8 White (Gley 8/N) White clay soil with black roots\n\nYellow level 1.5 Ox7 Yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Ochre level\n\nRed level 2 Ox6 Red (2.5YR 5/8) Red level\n\nMatrix 10 Ox5 White (Gley 8/N) Saprolite is a white to gray clay with\n\nVein 11 Ox4 White (Gley 8/N) rounded or sub-angular coarse\n\nMatrix 15 Ox3 Light greenish gray (Gley 8/5GY) blocky structures (up to 50 cm\n\nGreen fragment 16 Ox2 Light greenish gray (Gley 8/5BG) diameter) of green clay.

Exceptions\n\nare samples Ox1, Ce2m, Ce3b that correspond to sap-\n\nrocks with high percentages of K-feldspar; sample Ox2\n\nhas high percentage of illite. Figure 2 shows the overall\n\ndistribution of the minerals along the three mines ob-\n\ntained from averages of the % mineralogy of Table II.\n\nHalloysite is themost abundant claymineral in the three\n\nmines. Only in two samples of veins (Ce2av and Inc5,\n\nTable II) the amounts of kaolinite are higher than hal-\n\nloysite.\n\nThe XRD diffractograms of oriented, air-dried pre-\n\nparations of representative samples of the three mines\n\nare presented in Figure 3.\n\nThe veins in the rock (rhyolite) of Ceramarte Mine\n\n(Fig. 3A-Ce1av) are composed mostly of halloysite.\n\nThe saprock (Fig. 3A-2bm) still contains K-feldspar.\n\nThe veins in the saprock contain kaolinite of a high-\n\ndefect type (Fig. 3A-Ce3av)withHinckley Indexof0.6.\n\nTheupper saprolite (Fig. 3A-Ce7) ismadeof halloysite,\n\nkaolinite and traces of quartz.\n\nClays fromIncepaMinehave illite (Fig.3B-Inc2b)\n\nin the saprock but not in the veins (Fig. 3B-Inc1); illite\n\ntotally disappears in the clayey upper levels (Fig. 3B-\n\nInc4b).\n\nIn the Oxford Mine some primary block structures\n\nshowedhighamountsof illite (Fig. 3C-Ox2),but ingen-\n\neral, only lowcontents of illite (aver-2%), illite-smectite\n\n(aver-1.5%), quartz (aver-5%), microcline (aver-1%),\n\nvermiculite (aver-0.4%), and chlorite-vermiculite were\n\nidentifiedin theclayfractionof thestudiedsamples. The\n\nhighest % of kaolinite (42%) occurs in the veins (Fig.\n\n3C-Ox4), and the highest % of halloysite occurs in the\n\nclayey matrix (Fig. 3C-Ox5).\n\nTowardthetopofthemines, ironoxidesconcentrate\n\nin a red (hematite) level followed (in Oxford Mine) by\n\nan ochre (lepidocrocite) level.

One sample\n\nof Incepa Mine that showed a low CEC value (4.4) was\n\nalso statistically analyzed in order to obtain quantitative\n\nmorphological data of the length and width of the hal-\n\nloysite particles. Also a sample from Oxford mine was\n\nanalyzed. Statistic data are recorded in micrometers in\n\nTableV.SampleCe1v is fromwhiteclays inavein in the\n\nsaprock, Ce2v is from very pale brown clay in a vein in\n\nthe saprolite; sample Inc4a,b is from a laminated matrix\n\nof Incepa Mine.

Particles of sample\n\nInc4a,b have the highest value of maximum width.\n\nCOEXISTENCE OF HALLOYSITE AND KAOLINITE\n\nHalloysite and kaolinite coexist in Campo Alegre as\n\nwell as in several other kaolin deposits (Murray and\n\nKeller 1993). Why both minerals occur? Is there any\n\nrelationshipbetweenhalloysiteandkaolinitewithdiffer-\n\nent precursors? Are they related to different microenvi-\n\nronments? Jeong (1998) observed that genetic relation\n\nbetween the twominerals in theweatheringenvironment\n\nis rarely established.\n\nFelsic rocks of Campo Alegre Basin show little\n\nmineralogicalvariation: sanidineandquartzphenocrysts\n\nareubiquitous; arfvedsonite and ironoxidesmaybepre-\n\nsent; the matrix is a fine-grained quartz feldspar aggre-\n\ngate. As K-feldspar is the major primary alumino-sili-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\nA STUDY ON THE GENESIS OF KAOLIN CLAYS OF CAMPO ALEGRE BASIN 677\n\nFig. 9 \u2013 Tubes are the most common morphology for halloysite observed using SEM.

Under conditions of good drainage in the hu-\n\nmid tropics,K-feldsparweathers togivehollow tubesof\n\nhalloysite (Parham 1969). Also Banfield and Eggleton\n\n(1990) observed a mineralogical pathway in K-feldspar\n\nweathering, starting in etch pits and cracks with the for-\n\nmation of cell-textured materials of allophane compo-\n\nsition, smectite, a second protocrystalline material and\n\nspherical halloysite. After dissolution formed networks\n\nof cavities, Al and Si precipitated from solution and re-\n\nsulted the growth of tubular halloysite.\n\nThe origin of the kaolinite needs other interpreta-\n\ntions. InCampoAlegrekaolindeposits, kaoliniteoccurs\n\nas (iron-rich) stacks filling veins either in the rocks or in\n\nthe saprolite, or as tight aggregates in the saprolite. At\n\nIncepa and Oxford Mines also illite and illite-smectite\n\n(inherited from pyroclastic rocks) are mixed in the ma-\n\ntrix and could be remaining of a hydrothermal process.\n\nBanfield and Eggleton (1990) showed that kaolinite de-\n\nvelops from an illitic material \u2013 (Si > Al ? K > Fe) by\ncrystallizing epitactically. The weathering releases K\n\nand the crystals acquire irregular shape and small quan-\n\ntitiesof iron. But there isnomuscoviteor illiticmaterial\n\nat Ceramarte Mine to explain kaolinite origin. In this\n\ncase, the veins, where iron-rich kaolinite occurs, aremi-\n\ncroenvironments of highly weathered material inherited\n\nfromthe topof theweatheringprofile. Kaoliniteappears\n\nin stackswith small halloysite tubesbetween thekaolin-\n\nite plates. In an experimental transformation, Singh and\n\nMacKinnon (1996) caused hydrated Georgia kaolinite\n\nplates to roll, forming tubes with both smoothly curved\n\nlayers andplanar faces, as is commonlyobserved innat-\n\nural halloysites. Kaolinite rolling in the solid state was\n\nobserved in natural samples by Robertson and Eggle-\n\nton (1991) ascribed to transitional forms between kaoli-\n\nnite and halloysite.

Singh (1996) explained\n\nhow the 1:1 structure switches from halloysite to kaoli-\n\nnite: as a result of prolonged dehydration, hydrogen\n\nbonding between layers gradually became stronger, and\n\nthe structure shifts from rolling mechanism to tetrahe-\n\ndral rotation,causingtubes toproducelathsbyunrolling.\n\nWouatong et al. (1996) observed this morphological\n\ntransformation (unrolled spherical-shaped halloysite to\n\ntubular and finally unrolled again producing platy kao-\n\nlinite) in a granite saprolite. Present study observed the\n\nfollowing sequence of morphological changes in hal-\n\nloysite particles (Fig. 11) in aweatheringprofile: Tubes\n\n\u2013 Tubes with planar faces and internal cylindrical holes\n\n\u2013 Tubes with planar faces and internal hole with planar\n\nwalls-unrolled tubes-plates. Thecorrelationof theforms\n\nwith depth is not linear. All the forms occur along the\n\nweathering profile, but the transitional forms between\n\ntubes and plates were observed most frequently in the\n\nsamples near the surface.\n\nThe end members of the solid-state halloysite to\n\nkaolinite transformation at Campo Alegre basin are low\n\nHinckley Index and very broad basal peaks kaolinites,\n\nsimilartotheend-memberskaolinitesdescribedbyJeong\n\n(1998). All observations agree that halloysite is a meta-\n\nstable mineral at Campo Alegre basin, and transform to\n\nstable kaolinite with aging (weathering).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThis study resulted in the following conclusions:\n\n\u2013 The kaolin from Campo Alegre Basin is composed\n\nof halloysite (10 \u00c5 and 7 \u00c5) and disordered kaoli-\n\nnite. Halloysite content is higher than kaolinite,\n\nexcept in some veins; low abundant minerals are\n\nquartz, K-feldspar, illite, illite-smectite, vermicu-\n\nlite, anatase, hematite and lepidocrocite.\n\n\u2013 K-feldspar weathering is the starting point of the\n\nhalloysite formation as hollow tube particles with\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007)79 (4)\n\n\n\nA STUDY ON THE GENESIS OF KAOLIN CLAYS OF CAMPO ALEGRE BASIN 679\n\nFig. 11 \u2013 Observed morphological changes in the halloysite particles: Tubes (A), tubes with planar faces\n\nwith internal cylindrical holes (B), tubes with internal and external planar faces (C), unrolling tubes (D, E,\n\nF).The sequenceof changes inmorphology (A?B?C?D?E)due todehydrationofhalloysite, evolves\ninto platy kaolin particles.
