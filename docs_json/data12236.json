We developed a non-destructive model to estimate the leaf area (LA) of Vernonia ferruginea using \nthe length (L) and width (W) leaf dimensions. Different combinations of linear equations were obtained from L, L2, \nW, W2, LW and L2W2. The linear regressions using the product of LW dimensions were more efficient to estimate \nthe LA of V. ferruginea than models based on a single dimension (L, W, L2 or W2). Therefore, the linear regression \n\u201cLA=0.463+0.676WL\u201d provided the most accurate estimate of V. ferruginea leaf area. Validation of the selected model \nshowed that the correlation between real measured leaf area and estimated leaf area was very high.\n\nKeywords: Asteraceae, cerrado, savanna, statistical model, validation.\n\nModelo linear n\u00e3o-destrutivo para estimativa de \u00e1rea  \nfoliar de Vernonia ferruginea Less\n\nResumo\nA estimativa de \u00e1rea foliar \u00e9 um importante tra\u00e7o biom\u00e9trico para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do desenvolvimento foliar e do crescimento \nvegetal em experimentos de campo e casa-de-vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o.

Introduction\n\nThe leaf area measurement is one of the most common \nparameters evaluated in green house and field ecophysiological \nstudies (Wang and Zhang, 2012) on Brazilian savanna \n(locally know as \u201ccerrado\u201d) woody species, crops and \nweeds. Therefore, the accurate measurements of leaf area \n(LA) in field experiments may be time-consuming and \ngenerally requires the use of expensive equipment (e.g. \nportable leaf area meters). Such destructive methods require \nthe excision of the leaves, thus removing the possibility of \n\nsuccessive measurements of the same leaf. The excision of \na large number of leaves (causing the artificial reduction \nof the leaf life span) can interfere with the photosynthesis \nrate, reducing the plant growth and interfering with the \nphenology of this species, due to the reduction of the \ncanopy (Chabot and Hicks, 1982). In conservation areas \n(e.g. cerrado), many researchers are conducting different \nresearch using the same communities at the same time. So, \n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 2015, ?vol. 75, no. 1, p. 152-156 153153\n\nLeaf area estimation of Vernonia ferruginea\n\nthe excision of the leaves can interfere with the results of \nother experiments that are sharing the same group of plants.\n\nThe use of non-destructive models to estimate the leaf \narea has been used to understand the ecophysiology of \ncrops (e.g., Crocus sativus L. (Kumar, 2009), Juglans nigra \nL. (Zellers et al., 2012), terrestrial weeds (e.g. Merremia \ncissoides Lam. (Carvalho et al., 2011a) and aquatics (e.g. \nPistia stratiotes L. (Carvalho et al., 2011b)), and more \nrecently cerrado species (e.g. Styrax ferrugineus Nees &amp; \nMart and Styrax pholii A. DC. (Souza and Habermann, \n2014)). Linear models based on length and width leaf \nmeasurements have been considered the most simple and \nefficient models to estimate the leaf area of some species \n(Demirsoy and Lang, 2010, Giuffrida et al., 2011, Wang \nand Zhang, 2012). However, models to estimate the leaf \narea of the cerrado species are almost absent. So, non-\ndestructive models to estimate LA are not only required \nby agronomists, but also biologists and ecologists.\n\nVernonia ferruginea (Asteraceae) is a native species \nfrom Brazilian\u2019s cerrado with a good distribution by the \ncerrado remains. This species is often found as an invasive \nspecies of wastelands, pastures and shoulders of highways \nin S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil. The aim of this study was to \ndevelop and validate an efficient and non-destructive model \nto estimate the leaf area of V. ferruginea using leaf length \nand width dimensions.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n2.1. Studied site\n\nThis study was carried out in a field within Jaboticabal \nmunicipality, S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil (21\u00b014\u201919\u2019\u2019S, \n48\u00b016\u201909\u2019\u2019W). The climate in this region may be classified \nas CWA with a wet season from October to March and \na dry season from April to September. The mean annual \ntemperature is approximately 23 \u00b0C and the total annual \nrainfall is approximately 1411 mm.\n\n2.2. Plant samples and leaf measurements\nWe sampled a total of 200 well-developed leaves of 10 \n\nadult V. ferruginea plants in the beginning of March 2013. \nImmediately after cutting, leaves were carefully placed in \nplastic bags and transported to the laboratory. They were \nindividually scanned at 300 dpi, using a HP Photosmart \nC3100 series scanner coupled to a microcomputer. Leaf \narea (LA), length (L) and width (W) of each leaf were \ndetermined using the software ImageJ (Rasband, 2013), \nwhere L is the maximum length along the midrib and \nW is the maximum value perpendicular to the midrib \n(Figure 1). The LA is expressed in cm2 while L and W \nare expressed in cm.\n\n2.3. Model building\nWe used the 200 leaf measurements described above, \n\ntesting the relation between LA and L and/or W (Table 1). \nLeaf area (LA) was considered to be the dependent variable, \nwhile the independent variables were L, L2, W, W2, the \nproduct of LW and L2W2. We tested the internal validity \nof the models using the coefficient of determination (R2), \nmean square error (MSE), error sum of squares (SSE) \nand predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) \nas described in Ghoreishi et al. (2012). Residuals were \nalso analyzed to determine the presence of outliers and \nnon-constant error variance (Rouphael et al., 2010). The \nbest model was selected according to the combination \nof the higher R2 and the lowest MSE, SSE and PRESS \n(Table 1, Figure 2).\n\nWhen L and W were involved in the same model, we \ntested the co-linearity between them calculating the variance \ninflation factor (VIF) (Marquardt, 1970) and the tolerance \nvalue (T) (Gill, 1986). If the VIF value was higher than \n\nTable 1.

Model validation\nTo further validate the developed model, 185 extra leaves \n\nof V. ferruginea were sampled from the same site on the same \nyear and season, but from different plants. The LA, L and \nW were measured according to the procedures previously \ndescribed. The predicted leaf area (PLA) of each leaf was \ndetermined according to the parameters obtained from the \nselected model. We performed a linear regression using \nthe PLA and the observed leaf area (OLA = LA measured \nwith ImageJ) (Figure 3). The correlation between OLA and \nPLA was tested using a Spearman-Rank test (Souza and \nHabermann, 2014). The relative bias was estimated by the \nmean of differences (d) and the standard deviation of the \ndifferences (SD) (Figure 4). The distribution is considered \nnormal if at least 97% of the differences in a population lie \nbetween the limits of agreement (Rouphael et al., 2010). \nLinear regressions between LA, L and W were performed \nusing R 2.15.1 (R Core Team, 2012). The MSE and SSE \nwere determined using the R package systemfit while the \nPRESS was determined using the R package asbio.\n\n3. Results\n\nThe LA of V. ferruginea ranged from 6.73 to 22.97 cm2 \n(average = 14.43 cm2), the L ranged from 4.49 to 9.52 cm \n(average = 6.93 cm) and the W ranged from 1.95 to 4.04 cm \n(average = 2.99 cm). The VIF was smaller than 10 (1.01) and \nT was higher than 0.1 (0.99), showing that the co-linearity \nbetween W and L may be considered negligible, and both \nvariables may be included in the models n\u00b0 5 and 6.\n\nAll models were statistically significant (p<0.001). \nThe regression analysis suggested that LA was strongly \n\nFigure 3.

The model n\u00b05 presented \nthe highest R2 and lowest SSE, MSE and PRESS in relation \nto the other models (Table 1), being considered the most \nefficient model to predict V. ferruginea\u2019s leaf area (PLA \n= 0.463 + 0.676LW) (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 2015, ?vol. 75, no. 1, p. 152-156 155155\n\nLeaf area estimation of Vernonia ferruginea\n\nTo validate the selected model, we predicted the leaf \narea of 185 leaves of V. ferruginea using the model n\u00b0 5. \nThe correlation between OLA and PLA was significant \n(rs=0.999) by Spearman-Rank test. We also observed \nsignificant correlation after applying a new linear \ncorrelation between OLA and PLA (R2=0.95, p<0.001) \n(Figure 3). Considering that sometimes the correlation is \nan insufficient analysis to explain relationship between \nOLA and PLA, we plotted the differences between PLA \nand OLA against OLA (Figure 4). In the current study we \nobserved that the differences between PLA and OLA were \nnormally distributed and 98.4% of the plots lay between \nd \u00b1 3SD (Figure 4).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nRegression analysis suggested significant correlations \n(p<0.001) between LA and L, L2, W, W2, LW and L2W2. \nThese correlations seem universal since they were previously \nobserved in many models to estimate LA of crops (for \nreferences see Rouphael et al. 2010), bedding plants \n(Giuffrida et al., 2011) and woody species (Ghoreishi et al., \n2012) among others). These significant relations were \nmost evident between LA vs. LW and LA vs. L2W2, and \nin both cases, we observed coefficients of determination \n(R2) higher than 0.95 (Table 1). The model based on the \nrelationship between LA vs. LW (model n\u00b0 5) was selected \nnot only based on the higher R2 but also because it presented \nsmaller SSE, MSE and PRESS than the model between \nLA vs. L2W2. This criterion was used in accordance with \nRouphael et al. (2010) and Giuffrida et al. (2011).\n\nIn this study, we clearly observed that models with a \nsingle measurement of L, L2, W and W2 were less acceptable \nfor estimating the LA of V. ferruginea, presenting R2 around \n0.40 for the models using L and L2, and 0.66 for models \nusing W and W2. Souza and Habermann (2014) observed \na similar pattern when estimating the leaf area of Styrax \nferrugineus (savanna species) and S. pohlii (riparian forest \nspecies). In fact, the differences observed for S. pohlii among \nthe models using a single measurement (L or W) were not \nso discrepant as observed by V. ferruginea, producing the \nlowest R2 (0.82) observed for the model correlating LA \nand W2. However, as observed in this paper, the lowest R2 \n(0.58) found among the models used to estimate the LA of \nS. ferrugineus was observed in the models that correlated \nLA and L, and LA and L2.\n\nAs observed by Rouphael et al., (2010), the shape \ncoefficient of the selected model (model n\u00b05, ? = 0.68) \ncan be described by a shape between an ellipse (0.78) \nand a triangle (0.50) of the same length and maximum \nwidth. Our shape coefficient (0.68) showed similarity to \nthose calculated for native species and crops. Values of \n0.68 have been reported by S. pohlii, 0.70 for S. ferrugineus \n(Souza and Habermann, 2014), 0.72 for Rosa hybrida \nL. (Rouphael et al., 2010), 0.68 for Helianthus annuus \nL. (Rouphael et al., 2007), 0.69 for Diospyros kaki \nL. (Cristofori et al., 2008) and 0.73 for Salvia sclarea \nL. (Kumar and Sharma, 2010).\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nA simple and efficient model (LA=0.463+0.676LW) was \ndeveloped, and validated, to estimate the LA of Vernonia \nferruginea. Considering that leaf length and width can be \neasily measured with a ruler, this model is an important tool \nfor ecophysiological studies of V. ferruginea in the field \nor greenhouse experiments. The use of this model would \nenable researches to do non-destructive measurements and \nrepeat measurements in the same leaf, excluding the use of \nexpensive electronic equipment such as leaf area meters.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors acknowledge the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa \nno Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP) and Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de \nAperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior (CAPES) for \nthe PhD scholarships of MCS (Proc.
