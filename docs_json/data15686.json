In\n\nmy case, I also have the hope that, somewhere along the line, the world will benefit\n\nfrom the progress achieved.\n\nBehind each author, there are always many people who made him who he is and\n\nhelped him persist and continue when the path was rougher or the will was weaker. My\n\nPhD thesis is no more than another work made by someone who would certainly not\n\nhave succeeded if it were not for the support of many people along the way. Hence, I\n\nwish I could thank individually every single person that contributed, in some measure,\n\nto helping me carrying out this work to its end.\n\nAgradec?o primeiro ao meu orientador, Paulo Silva, por me ter oferecido a possib-\n\nilidade de fazer esta tese e, desde o in??cio, ter acreditado que eu seria capaz de a\n\nconcluir.

I hope you have enjoyed it.\n\nDuring my PhD thesis I had the great chance to spend significant periods of time\n\nabroad, which I cherished a lot. It is when you get out of your comfort zone that you\n\n\n\nevolve, personally, and scientifically as well. However, each time you go abroad, you are\n\nfar from your home, your routine, your friends, your family. It makes sense to explain\n\nthis, so that people can understand how much I am thankful to everyone that helped\n\nme \u201cto arrive\u201d over and over again, that received me the best way possible and thus\n\nundoubtedly contributed to the success of this thesis.\n\nA mis compan?eros de carrera y de piso en Santander, que me recibira?n tan bien, me\n\nacompan?aran e hicieran de los tres meses que pase? all?? una buena experiencia de inicio\n\nde tesis.\n\nTo all the GLOBEX team, for the intense month passed in Delft, for sharing your\n\nknowledge and giving me the best motivation possible for my first year of PhD. Thank\n\nyou as well for the interesting exchanges of ideas, the support provided when necessary\n\nand the good times spent together.\n\nA? tous les gens que j\u2019ai connu en France, que maintenant j\u2019appelle des amis ou famille.\n\nMerci Thibaud, pour avoir e?te? le premier a? m\u2019ouvrir ta porte en toute confiance, a?\n\nm\u2019amener de partout parmi tes amis, a? me pre?senter les Alpes.

Assim sendo, bem\n\nperto do final, quero agradecer a todos os meus amigos da beira-mar. Obrigada por\n\ncontinuarem a seguir ao meu lado nesta vida e por aceitarem, sem cobrar, a minha\n\nause?ncia intermitente nestes u?ltimos anos.

Aproveito tambe?m para vos pedir desculpa, desculpa por todos os momentos\n\n\n\nem que na?o estive presente por estar a construir o meu caminho. Obrigada por sempre\n\nme encorajarem a seguir as minhas escolhas e por me apoiarem incondicionalmente\n\nnessas escolhas. Sem voce?s na?o seria a pessoa que sou, na?o teria chegado aqui, na?o teria\n\nhavido tese.\n\nEt a? toi, Seb, obrigada por tudo.\n\n\n\n\n\nkeywords waves, nearshore, cross-shore profile, hydrodynamics, morphodynamics,\nwave nonlinearities, infragravity waves, physical modelling, numerical\nmodelling, field data\n\nabstract Wave nonlinearities have long been recognised as being among the\nmain drivers of sediment transport in the coastal zone. However, there\nare still significant errors in the prediction of this transport associated,\npartially due to inaccurate predictions of the velocity nonlinearities. The\ninfragravity waves, which coexist with the short waves in the coastal\nzone, are long-period waves (with 20-200 s) associated to the short-\nwave groups. Their generation, propagation and dissipation mechanisms\nare already reasonably well understood, but their influence on sediment\ntransport is still very poorly characterised.\n\nIn order to (i) improve current predictions of velocity nonlinearities and\n(ii) investigate the role of infragravity waves in sediment transport, new\nexperiments were carried out both in a fixed-bed wave flume and in\na light-weight-sediment wave flume. The physical-modelling data set\nis used in combination with field data and numerical simulations for\nstudying both subjects.\n\nExisting parameterizations of velocity nonlinearities account only for the\ninfluence of local wave parameters (e.g. wave height, wave length and\nwater depth), which leads to considerable estimation errors, especially\nof the maximal values of nonlinearity. This work shows that the velocity\nnonlinearities depend also on non-local wave parameters: (i) offshore\nwave steepness, (ii) offshore spectral bandwidth and (iii) beach slope.\nA new parameterization is proposed, which reduces by about 50% the\nroot-mean-square error relatively to former parameterizations.\n\nThe experimental results in the light-weight-sediment wave flume demon-\nstrate that wave conditions with the same short-wave energy, but differ-\nent low-frequency modulation, shape different equilibrium beach profiles.\nThe influence of the infragravity waves on the sediment transport is\nconfirmed and depends on two different mechanisms: (i) advection of\nthe short-wave suspended sediment by the infragravity-waves, which\nis dependent on the infragravity-wave height and phasing with the\nshort-wave groups and (ii) modulation of short-wave nonlinearities by\ninfragravity-wave motion, both directly and indirectly, through water-\ndepth modulation.\n\nChanges in the beachface morphology induced by infragravity waves\nare connected to beach-profile changes in the surf and inner-shoaling\nzones, highlighting the existent link between the different zones of the\ncross-shore beach profile.\n\n\n\n\n\npalavras-chave ondas, zona costeira, perfil transversal, hidrodina?mica, morfodina?mica,\nna?o-linearidades das ondas, ondas infragrav??ticas, modelac?a?o f??sica,\nmodelac?a?o nume?rica, dados de campo\n\nresumo As na?o-linearidades das ondas de superf??cie sa?o desde ha? algum tempo\nreconhecidas como um dos principais promotores do transporte sedi-\nmentar na zona costeira. Contudo, existem ainda erros significativos\nna estimativa do transporte devidos, entre outros, a uma imprecisa\ndescric?a?o das na?o-linearidades da velocidade do escoamento orbital.\nAs ondas infragrav??ticas, que coexistem com as ondas curtas na zona\ncosteira, sa?o ondas de longo per??odo (20-200 s) associadas aos grupos\nde ondas curtas. Os mecanismos de gerac?a?o, propagac?a?o e dissipac?a?o\ndestas ondas sa?o actualmente razoavelmente bem compreendidos, mas\na sua influe?ncia no transporte sedimentar ainda apresenta limitac?o?es.\n\nCom o objectivo de (i) melhorar as parameterizac?o?es existentes das\nna?o-linearidades da velocidade e (ii) investigar o papel das ondas infra-\ngrav??ticas no transporte sedimentar, foram realizadas novas experie?ncias\nem dois canais de ondas, um de fundo fixo e outro de fundo mo?vel com\nsedimentos de baixa densidade. Os dados obtidos nos modelos f??sicos\nforam utilizados conjuntamente com dados de campo e de simulac?o?es\nnume?ricas para investigar ambos os temas.\n\nAs parameterizac?o?es existentes para as na?o-linearidades da velocidade\nte?m apenas em conta a influe?ncia de para?metros locais de onda (e.g.\naltura de onda, comprimento de onda e profundidade de a?gua), o\nque resulta em erros considera?veis nas estimativas, em particular dos\nvalor ma?ximos de na?o-linearidade. Este trabalho evidencia que a na?o-\nlinearidade da velocidade depende tambe?m de para?metros que na?o\nsa?o locais: (i) a declividade da onda ao largo, (ii) a largura da banda\nespectral ao largo e (iii) o declive da praia. Uma nova parameterizac?a?o\nque reduz em cerca de 50% o erro dos resultados obtidos com as\nparameterizac?o?es existentes e? proposta.\n\nOs resultados experimentais obtidos no canal de ondas com fundo mo?vel\ndemonstram que climas de agitac?a?o mar??tima com a mesma energia\nde ondas curtas, mas com diferente modulac?a?o de baixa freque?ncia,\nmoldam perfis de praia diferentes. A influe?ncia das ondas infragrav??ticas\nno transporte sedimentar e? posta em evide?ncia e processa-se atrave?s de\ndois mecanismos distinctos: (i) advecc?a?o pelas ondas infragrav??ticas de\nsedimento colocado em suspensa?o pela acc?a?o das ondas curtas, a qual\ne? dependente da altura das ondas infragrav??ticas e da sua fase relativa-\nmente aos grupos de ondas curtas e (ii) as ondas infragrav??ticas alteram\nas na?o-linearidades das ondas curtas, tanto directa como indirectamente,\natrave?s da modulac?a?o da altura da coluna de a?gua.\n\nAs variac?o?es morfolo?gicas da face da praia induzidas pelas ondas infra-\ngrav??ticas esta?o associadas a alterac?o?es do perfil de praia nas zonas de\nsurf e de empolamento, evidenciando o elo existente entre as diferentes\nzonas do perfil transversal da praia.\n\n\n\n\n\nmots-cle?s vagues, littoral, profil transversal, hydrodynamique, morphodynamique,\nnon-line?arite?s des vagues, vagues infra-gravitaires, mode?lisation\nphysique, mode?lisation nume?rique, donne?es de terrain\n\nresume? Les non-line?arite?s des ondes de surface, qui se caracte?risent par leur\naspect dissyme?trique, sont reconnues comme l\u2019un des principaux moteurs\ndu transport de se?diments en zone littorale. Cependant, l\u2019estimation du\ntransport reste imparfaite, en partie du fait d\u2019une description inexacte\ndes non-line?arite?s de la vitesse de l\u2019e?coulement orbital. Les ondes infra-\ngravitaires, qui coexistent avec les ondes courtes en zone littorale, sont\ndes ondes de longue pe?riode (20-200 s) associe?s aux groupes d\u2019ondes\ncourtes. Les me?canismes de ge?ne?ration, propagation et dissipation de\nces ondes sont maintenant relativement bien compris, mais leur effet\nsur le transport se?dimentaire est encore mal connu.\n\nAfin (i) d\u2019ame?liorer les parame?trisations existantes des non-line?arite?s\nde vitesse et (ii) d\u2019e?tudier le ro?le des ondes infra-gravitaires dans le\ntransport se?dimentaire, de nouvelles expe?riences ont e?te? re?alise?es dans\ndeux canaux a? houle, l\u2019un avec un fond fixe et l\u2019autre avec un fond\nmobile constitue? de se?diments de faible densite?. Les donne?es obtenues\navec ces mode?les physiques ont e?te? utilise?s conjointement a? des donne?es\nde terrain et des simulations nume?riques pour e?tudier les deux sujets.\n\nLes parame?trisations classiques pour les non-line?arite?s de vitesse\nprennent seulement en compte l\u2019influence de parame?tres locaux (la\nhauteur de vague, la longueur d\u2019onde et la profondeur d\u2019eau), ce qui\nentra??ne des erreurs importantes dans les estimations, en particulier\nles valeurs maximales de non-line?arite?. Ce travail montre que les non-\nline?arite?s de vitesse ont aussi une de?pendance avec des parame?tres\nqui ne sont pas locaux: (i) la cambrure de vague et (ii) la largeur de\nla bande spectrale au large, ainsi que (iii) la pente de la plage. Une\nnouvelle parame?trisation est propose?e, qui re?duit d\u2019environ 50% l\u2019erreur\nsur les re?sultats obtenus avec les parame?trisations existantes.\n\nLes re?sultats expe?rimentaux obtenus dans le canal a? houle avec un fond\nmobile montrent que des conditions de vagues avec la me?me e?nergie\nd\u2019ondes courtes, mais avec une modulation basse fre?quence diffe?rente,\nmode?lent des profils de plage diffe?rents. L\u2019influence des ondes infra-\ngravitaires sur le transport se?dimentaire est mis en e?vidence par deux\nme?canismes distincts: (i) l\u2019advection par les ondes infra-gravitaires\nde se?diment mis en suspension par l\u2019action des ondes courtes, qui\nde?pend de la hauteur des ondes infra-gravitaires et de leur phase par\nrapport aux groupes d\u2019ondes courtes et (ii) les ondes infra-gravitaires\nmodifient les non-line?arite?s des ondes courtes, que ce soit directement\nou indirectement, par modulation de la hauteur de la colonne d\u2019eau.\n\nLes variations morphologiques du haut de plage induites par les ondes\ninfra-gravitaires sont associe?es a?

Coastal cities are usually\n\nimportant ports favouring commerce and fishing. Ocean-related recreation and tourism\n\nare rapidly growing, being an important vector of development and economical growth.\n\nMost of the megacities of the world with more than 2.5 million inhabitants are located\n\nin the coastal area. Unfortunately, the rapid increase of people living near the coast\n\nhas generated an imbalance of the natural system.\n\nThe coastal-erosion problem is a typical example of such an imbalance. Affecting\n\ncoasts worldwide, it is currently one of the greatest problems of the coastal zones where\n\nhuman occupation is intense. On a geological timescale, the oceans of the world have\n\nrisen and retreated several times before. Each time, the coast has adapted, advancing\n\nor retreating. After the last glaciation, about 20,000 years ago, a fast rise of the mean\n\nsea-level of about 8 mm/year was observed, until about 7,000 years ago, slowing down\n\nto 1.4 mm/year at present (Komar, 1976). The sea-level rise during the last 20,000\n\nyears has left the coast out of equilibrium and the coastline configuration unadjusted to\n\nthe existing wave climate. Therefore, in the last 7,000 years, the coast has been trying\n\nto adapt naturally, eroding capes and filling estuaries, trying to smooth the coastline\n\n(Komar, 1976). Furthermore, global warming is nowadays contributing to an expansion\n\nof the oceans, which also adds to the sea-level rise (IPCC, 2014). Global warming\n\nand associated climate change may further contribute to increase storm frequency and\n\nintensity (IPCC, 2014), which is expected to contribute to beach erosion as well. On\n\na shorter time scale, human action has actively contributed to aggravate the problem\n\nof coastal erosion, with sand dredging and dam construction in rivers resulting in a\n\ndecrease of the sediment input to the beaches. Diverse coastal engineering solutions\n\n1\n\n\n\nSection 1.2 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nwere built in the last decades (groynes, sea-walls, ...) to help tackling this problem, but\n\nunfortunately these frequently end up by solving the problem only locally.\n\nThe sea-level rise and the shortage of sediments are only part of the problem. The\n\nother part is the intense occupation of the retreating littoral zone. While wild coasts\n\nwill continuously adjust to sea-level rise and to eventual changes of the wave climate,\n\nthe wide stretches of coast too intensely occupied by people have to be protected. Since\n\nthe cost of relocating coastal populations and infrastructures is often too great to be\n\nafforded, other solutions must be found.\n\nIn order to find solutions for the problem of coastal erosion and thus to help coastal\n\nmanagement, the dynamics of the coastal system must be well understood. If accurate\n\npredictions of the evolution of the coastline are to be made, all the processes contributing\n\nto the sediment transport, and thus to the changing of the beach morphology, must be\n\nthoroughly analysed and weighted.\n\nThe processes involved in sediment transport are many and complex and act on a\n\nwide range of time and space scales, from seconds to millennia, from the tiniest clay\n\ngrain to an entire delta. Hence, it is a long and ambitious task to achieve a complete\n\nunderstanding of the sediment transport and morphodynamic processes of a coastal\n\nsystem. Since the mid of the twentieth century, many researchers have made their\n\ncontribution to this task, but many questions remain unanswered.\n\n1.2 Motivation and objectives\n\nWave and velocity nonlinearities have long been recognised as being amongst the\n\nmain drivers of sediment transport and have recently started to be incorporated in\n\nsediment transport models, which can then be used to simulate real situations. However,\n\nthere are still significant errors in the prediction of the sediment transport associated,\n\namong others, to inaccurate predictions of the velocity nonlinearities. Therefore, one of\n\nthe aims of this thesis is to improve the comprehension of these nonlinearities, in order\n\nto obtain better estimations of sediment transport and thus better predictions of the\n\ncoastal evolution.\n\nMost damage done by waves on coastal zones and human infrastructure happens\n\nduring storms, particularly when they occur during spring tides. During the storms,\n\nlow-pressure systems drive strong winds that can be acompagnied by storm surges\n\n(local rise of the sea-level) and big waves that can have an important impact on the\n\ncoast, either taking offshore important quantities of sediment or promoting overwash\n\nand inundation of the upper beach. It is during storms that infragravity waves are more\n\ncommonly seen to dominate the water motion very close to the shore. These are long\n\n2\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction Section 1.3\n\nperiod waves (20-200 s) that are associated to the short-wave groups and modulate the\n\nwater-depth at the coast, allowing greater short waves to propagate higher up the beach.\n\nThey can thus have an important role on dune and beach erosion. However, the effect\n\nof these waves on sediment transport is still very poorly characterised and quantified.\n\nHence, the other main objective of this thesis is to develop the current knowledge on the\n\nsediment transport by infragravity waves, aiming to contribute, once again, to a better\n\ncomprehension of the sediment transport processes, especially during storm conditions.\n\nIf wave action and sediment transport during storms are well understood and can be\n\npredicted in advance, damage to coastal infrastructures and beaches can ultimately be\n\nminimised.\n\n1.3 Organisation of the thesis\n\nThis thesis is organised in five chapters. A description of the contents of each chapter\n\nis subsequently presented.\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction - introduces the work developed in the thesis and\n\nits context, motivation and general objectives.\n\nChapter 2 - Fundamentals of coastal dynamics - describes the fundamental\n\nconcepts that constitute the basis of this thesis: the cross-shore beach profile and its\n\nhydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes.\n\nChapter 3 - Wave propagation and nonlinearities - based on the physical\n\nmodel data set of the GLOBEX project, on field data and on SERR1D numerical-\n\nmodel runs, it brings insight on wave and velocity nonlinearities. The chapter starts\n\nby an introduction, where the state of the art on wave and velocity nonlinearities is\n\npresented together with the organisation of the chapter. Then, the GLOBEX project\n\ndata and measurements are described and analysed, with a special emphasis on wave\n\nnonlinearities and infragravity waves. Field data and SERR1D numerical-model runs\n\nare used to extend the results of the GLOBEX data analysis. The discussion of the\n\ndifferent results culminates in the improvement of the Ruessink et al. (2012) parameter-\n\nization for the velocity nonlinearities, by the introduction of a dependence on a new\n\nparameter and on spectral bandwidth. The chapter draws to an end with the conclusion.\n\nChapter 4 - The role of infragravity waves on beach morphodynamics-\n\npresents the results of a set of experiments performed in the LEGI light-weight-sediment\n\n3\n\n\n\nSection 1.3 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nflume with three different wave conditions, for which short-wave energy was kept\n\nconstant and IG-wave height was varied. At first, the state of the art of the role of\n\ninfragravity waves on sediment transport and the organisation of the chapter are presen-\n\nted. This is followed by a methodology section, where the LEGI experimental facility is\n\ndescribed, as well as the input wave conditions, instrumentation and associated methods.\n\nSubsequently, the evolution of the beach towards equilibrium is analysed and the role\n\nof infragravity waves on sediment transport is more thoroughly examined through the\n\nanalysis of the beach response to two-wave-group runs, in terms of hydrodynamics and\n\nmorphodynamics. After a discussion of the different mechanisms by which infragravity\n\nwaves contribute to sediment transport, the chapter ends with the conclusion.\n\nChapter 5 - Conclusions and perspectives - summarises the work developed\n\nand the conclusions of the previous chapters and highlights the existing limitations and\n\npossible solutions, together with future perspectives of research.\n\n4\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nFundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\n2.1 The beach profile\n\nThe nearshore ocean starts where the waves first feel the sea bed, and extends all the\n\nway to the coast. Many different types of coasts can be found in nature, from high cliffs\n\nto gravel or sandy beaches, from coral environments to complex delta systems. The\n\naction of the processes driving the dynamics of the nearshore region can be separated\n\nin two components: the cross-shore direction and the long-shore direction. In this work,\n\nthe focus will be on the dynamics of the sandy beaches for processes acting in the\n\ncross-shore direction only.\n\nThe cross-shore beach profile is one of the most important characteristics of natural\n\nsea coasts, since it can be used to evaluate the accretion or erosion of a specific coastal\n\nsite, as well as the vulnerability of particular regions (Didenkulova &amp; Soomere, 2011).\n\nIt can be schematically divided in different zones, based on the wave propagation and\n\nhydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes, as shown in Fig. 2.1. Each hydrodynamic\n\nzone can be further divided into smaller sections, for convenience: the shoaling zone\n\nSwash zone Surf zone Shoaling zone\n\nBreaker zone\n\nFigure 2.1: Cross-shore beach profile of a barred beach (adapted from Short &amp; Woodroffe, 2009).\n\n5\n\n\n\nSection 2.1 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\ninto the outer- and the inner-shoaling zones, the surf zone, analogously, into the outer\n\nand inner-surf zones and the swash zone into the upper and lower swash zones.\n\nThe beach profile shape depends, at each moment, on the balance between the different\n\nhydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes at work along its length. However, for\n\nstudy purposes, it is often assumed that a beach profile under constant wave forcing\n\nwill eventually reach a dynamic equilibrium state, with small variations around a stable\n\nequilibrium shape. Dean (1977) modified an empirical equation, initially proposed by\n\nBrunn (1954), to describe the shape of an equilibrium profile, which consists essentially\n\non a power law relating the water depth (h) to the offshore distance (x),\n\nh = ? (xs ?x)2/3 , (2.1)\n\nwhere ? is a proportionality constant that depends on the size of the sediment or,\n\nalternatively, on the fall velocity (Dean, 1977) and xs is the position of the shoreline.\n\nAccording to Eq. 2.1, the coarser the sediments, the greater is the value of ? and thus\n\nthe steeper is the beach.\n\nIn nature, the wave conditions are constantly changing. Therefore, an equilibrium\n\nprofile can only be defined as a spatial mean, along a certain coast, or a temporal mean,\n\nduring a given period of time. Very often this is done to classify beach profiles according\n\nto their seasonality: a \u201csummer\u201d profile, associated with mild wave conditions, has\n\ngenerally a large berm and a steep beachface; and a \u201cwinter\u201d profile, resulting from\n\nhighly-energetic wave conditions, has a shorter berm and a mild beachface. Wright &amp;\n\nShort (1984) have proposed a classification of the beach profiles according to the Dean\n\nnumber, defined by\n\n? =\nHc\nTcws\n\n, (2.2)\n\nwhere Hc and Tc are the characteristic height and period of the incident wave conditions\n\nand ws the fall velocity of the sediment. Wright &amp; Short (1984) have considered Hc\n\nand Tc as the breaker wave height and period, respectively, but these variables can also\n\nbe defined for the offshore wave conditions, as was done by Dalrymple &amp; Thompson\n\n(1976).\n\nFig. 2.2 shows the beach-profile types that can be defined according to the Dean\n\nnumber. For ? &lt;1, the beaches are reflective, characterized by a relatively steep\n\nand narrow beachface with a berm and a surf zone without bars. Waves are strongly\n\nreflected (surging breakers are common), the sediments tend to be coarser and the surf\n\nzone is narrow. On the other end, the dissipative beaches, with an ? > 5, tend to be\n\nwide and gently-sloping, with one or more linear bars. These type of beaches are the\n\nresult of high-energy waves that start breaking far offshore. The intermediate range\n\n6\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.1\n\nFigure 2.2: Plane (left) and profile (right) configurations of the six beach-profile types that can be\ndefined according to the Dean number (Wright &amp; Short, 1984).\n\n7\n\n\n\nSection 2.2 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\n(1 &lt;? &lt;5) represents a variety of barred and terraced beaches.\n\nAt a given location, the beach is constantly changing its shape. Mild wave conditions\n\nwill tend to force the beach towards a \u201csummer\u201d (reflective) profile, while storm waves\n\nare responsible for driving the sediment fast offshore, changing the beach profile to a\n\n\u201cwinter\u201d (dissipative) state. In order to perceive the dynamics of the beach profile, the\n\nhydrodynamics and morphodynamics processes involved must be understood.\n\n2.2 Hydrodynamics\n\nFluid motions in the ocean are generated by different phenomena. The wind, pressure\n\ndifferences, the rotation of the Earth and attraction by the moon, seismic and vulcanic\n\nactivity are some of the phenomena that can generate sea-surface waves and currents.\n\nEach different forcing induces motions at a different scale of time and space, which are\n\nillustrated in Fig. 2.3.\n\nFor describing the beach-profile evolution in the timescale of a day to a year, it is\n\nthe dynamics of the waves generated by the wind (associated to pressure systems) that\n\nmust be analysed (see Table 1a of Stive et al. (2002)). Waves can be generated locally\n\nby the wind, starting as surface ripples, eventually evolving into wind waves. Their\n\ncharacteristics depend on the intensity and duration of the wind and its fetch (distance\n\nFigure 2.3: Space-time scales of morphology in the nearshore (Thornton et al., 2000).\n\n8\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.2\n\nover which it blows). If the waves then travel a long distance from their generation\n\nregion, they will tend to organize in groups with similar amplitude and frequency, the\n\nswell. Swell waves frequently co-exist with wind waves. Both these types of waves are\n\ngravity waves, since the gravitational force is the restitution mechanism acting on the\n\nfree-surface of the sea when the waves propagate through it.\n\nAs the waves propagate from deep waters to the coast, they transform progressively,\n\ndiffracting, refracting, shoaling, breaking or dissipating their energy through bottom-\n\nfriction. Diffraction involves a change in the direction of the propagating waves as\n\nthey pass through an opening or around a barrier in their path and thus allows waves\n\nto propagate into the lee zone (the sheltered zone) behind structures or geographical\n\nfeatures. The depth-induced refraction is the turning of the direction of wave propagation\n\nwhen, in shallow water, the wave fronts travel at an angle with the depth contours.\n\nSince the waves propagate more slowly in shallow than in deep water, the wave fronts\n\ntend to become aligned with the depth contours. Wave refraction can also be caused by\n\ncurrents.\n\nSince the waves propagating towards the coast with a certain angle will thus tend\n\nto align perpendicularly to the bathymetry, when they leave deep water, the most\n\nrelevant wave transformations take place along the cross-shore direction. Along this\n\ndirection, the waves shoal and dissipate their energy, mostly through breaking and\n\nbottom friction.\n\n2.2.1 Linear wave theory\n\nIn deep water, small-amplitude wave motion (H&lt;&lt;h) can be thought of as being\n\na pure sinusoidal movement that can be represented by the linear wave theory (Airy,\n\n1845), as shown in Fig. 2.4. According to this theory, a progressive sinusoidal wave can\n\nFigure 2.4: Sketch of a progressive sinusoidal wave (Abreu, 2011).\n\n9\n\n\n\nSection 2.2 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\nbe defined by a sinusoidal variation of the sea-surface ?, with a certain wave length L\n\n(the horizontal distance between corresponding points on two successive waves), height\n\nH (the vertical distance from crest to trough) and period T (the time between the\n\npassing of two successive crests at a given point),\n\n?(x,t) =\nH\n\n2\ncos (kx??t) , (2.3)\n\nwhere x is the spatial coordinate in the direction of wave propagation and t the temporal\n\ncoordinate, k is the wave number (k = 2?\nL\n\n) and ? is the wave angular frequency (? = 2?\nT\n\n).\n\nIn deep water, the particle motion during a wave cycle under a passing linear wave\n\nfollows circular orbits, whose diameter decreases with depth until the wave base (the\n\nlimit of fluid motion).\n\nThe linear sinusoidal waves are ideal small-amplitude waves that can only exist in\n\ndeep water ( h\nL\n> 0.5). As the waves travel towards the coast and the water depth\n\ndecreases, the shoaling process begins. The waves start feeling the bottom and slow\n\ndown. This decrease of the phase velocity of the wave (c = L\nT\n\n) implies a decrease of its\n\nkinetic energy. In order to maintain the total energy of the wave constant, the potential\n\nenergy increases and, therefore, the wave height also increases.\n\nAs the waves shoal, the particle motion below the free surface also changes, particu-\n\nlarly near the bottom. The circular orbits flatten and become elliptical and, in shallow\n\nwaters ( h\nL\n&lt;0.05), the vertical component of the movement becomes negligible. This\n\nmeans that, near the bottom, the horizontal particle displacements and the horizontal\n\nvelocities become large. Hence, to satisfy the no-slip condition at the seabed, a thin\n\nlayer where the wave-induced motion is strongly influenced by the bed develops: the\n\nboundary layer. This layer is characterized by strong velocity gradients that lead to\n\nnoticeable shear stresses. This layer is particularly relevant to sediment transport,\n\nbecause it is responsible for the mobilization and transport of the sediment particles.\n\nFurthermore, this region is highly turbulent and, consequently, it is where most of the\n\ndissipation of the flow energy occurs.\n\n2.2.2 Nonlinear wave properties\n\nStokes (1847) was one of the first to observe and study the change of the wave shape\n\nprior to breaking. He remarked that, as the waves approach the coast and propagate\n\ninto shallower water (transitional, 0.05 &lt;h\nL\n&lt;0.5, and shallow, h\n\nL\n&lt;0.05 depths), their\n\nshape changes, with a gradual peaking of the crests and flattening of the troughs, known\n\nas an increase of wave skewness (horizontal asymmetry). At the end of the shoaling\n\nzone and throughout the surf zone, the waves start loosing their vertical symmetry as\n\n10\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.2\n\nwell, assuming a saw-tooth shape, with a steep front face and a more gently-sloping rear\n\nface, increasing their asymmetry (Svendsen &amp; Madsen, 1978; Elgar et al., 1988). This\n\ntransformation of the free-surface elevation along the cross-shore profile is illustrated in\n\nFig. 2.5.\n\nAs they propagate towards the coast, the waves induce a gradient of the excess\n\nhorizontal-momentum flux, which results in an increase of the mean water level after\n\nthe breakpoint (the set-up), compensated by a lowering of the mean water level offshore\n\nof the breakpoint (the set-down) (Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart, 1962). Furthermore, the\n\nwave propagation towards the coast may induce an onshore-directed mass flux (a steady\n\nsecond-order drift velocity, known as the Stokes drift, (Stokes, 1847)). In the surf zone,\n\nthe surf roller adds to the Stokes drift, increasing the mean onshore-directed mass flux.\n\nThis flux promotes an accumulation of water near the coast, which must then return\n\noffshore. This happens by means of an offshore-directed return flow below the level of\n\nthe wave trough, the undertow. This processes are schematically described in Fig. 2.6.\n\nNear the bed, the flow is affected by the bottom boundary layer. The wave bottom\n\nboundary layer is generally a highly-turbulent layer due to the sediment roughness and\n\nit has a limited thickness (of the order of 1-10 cm), since it cannot fully develop to a\n\nstationary logarithmic flow profile due to the continuously-changing oscillatory flow.\n\nBesides the purely oscillatory flow driven by the wave motion near the bed, there is also\n\nan onshore mean current, known as the boundary-layer streaming (Longuet-Higgins,\n\n1953).\n\nThe linear or small-amplitude wave theory described in the previous subsection\n\nprovides a useful first approximation to the wave motion. However, ocean waves are\n\ngenerally not small in amplitude and, as they approach the coast and start shoaling and\n\nincreasing their height (H/h&lt;&lt;1 and H/L&lt;&lt;1 assumptions become progressively\n\ninvalid), the linear wave theory no longer provides a sound description. In order to\n\nimprove the linear theory and to better approach the complete solution of ocean waves,\n\na perturbation solution using successive approximations may be developed (e.g. Stokes,\n\nFigure 2.5: Sketch of the wave-shape transformation and corresponding orbital motions as waves\npropagate from deep to shallow waters (Abreu, 2011).\n\n11\n\n\n\nSection 2.2 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\nFigure 2.6: Hydrodynamics of a barred beach (adapted from Grasso, 2009).\n\n1847; Boussinesq, 1872; Korteweg &amp; deVries, 1895). The extended theories, often called\n\nnonlinear wave theories, have also the advantage of being able of taking into account\n\nphenomena associated with the wave nonlinearity, such as the onshore-directed mass\n\ntransport mentioned before. The cnoidal, solitary and Stokes theories are examples\n\nof nonlinear wave theories. Fig. 2.7 shows the wave profile shape as predicted by the\n\ndifferent wave theories.\n\nAs the the shape of the waves starts changing, with increasing skewness and\n\nasymmetry, the corresponding orbital velocity near the bottom follows the variation of\n\nthe free-surface elevation, and also becomes nonlinear, as depicted in Fig. 2.8.\n\nIn the case of a purely-velocity-skewed oscillatory flow, the velocity at the wave crest\n\nFigure 2.7: Wave profile shape of different progressive gravity waves (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,\n2002).\n\n12\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.2\n\nFigure 2.8: Sketch of a velocity-skewed flow (left) and an acceleration-skewed flow (right) (Abreu,\n2011).\n\nis higher, but of shorter duration than at the trough. This induces larger bed shear\n\nstresses during the crest than during the trough. When the flow is purely velocity-\n\nasymmetric, under the steep front face of the waves, the velocity varies rapidly from a\n\nmaximum negative (offshore) value to a maximum positive (onshore) value, promoting\n\nrapid fluid accelerations. The accelerations induced by the motion of the rear face of the\n\nwave are much smaller. This implies that, for velocity-asymmetric flows, acceleration\n\nis skewed. Abrupt accelerations are associated with thinner boundary layers and thus\n\nhigher bed shear stresses for a given velocity magnitude (Elgar et al., 2001).\n\nThe near-bed orbital velocity skewness and asymmetry are crucial for sediment\n\ntransport and are thus important to quantify. In this work, the statistical definitions\n\nfor velocity skewness (Sku) and asymmetry (Asu) are used and calculated, according to\n\nElgar et al. (1988), with the following expressions,\n\nSku =\n?(u?u)3?\n\n?u3\n, (2.4)\n\nand\n\nAsu =\n\n?\n(H (u?u))3\n\n?\n?u3\n\n, (2.5)\n\nwhere u represents the velocity time series, with the angle brackets denoting time-\n\naverage, ? represents the standard deviations and H is the imaginary part of the\n\nHilbert transform. The evolution of skewness and asymmetry can then be used to\n\ndescribe the transformation of the near-bed velocity as the waves approach the shore.\n\nAnother way of describing this wave transformation along the cross-shore profile is in\n\nterms of the energy present at each frequency in the wave spectrum, as is illustrated in\n\nFig. 2.9. Initially, when the waves leave deep water, most of the energy is concentrated\n\nnear the peak frequency (blue spectrum in Fig. 2.9). Then, as they progress into\n\nshallower water, nonlinear triad interactions between the different frequency components\n\nstart taking place and changing the wave shape (Elgar &amp; Guza, 1985). Energy is first\n\ntransferred from the primary wave components near the peak (f1 and f2, in the case\n\nof bichromatic waves), towards secondary components that are multiples of the peak\n\nfrequency (for bichromatic waves, towards secondary components with the sum f1 + f2\n\n13\n\n\n\nSection 2.2 Chapter 2.

These secondary components are called super or\nsubharmonics, if they have, respectively, greater or smaller frequencies than the peak\n\nfrequency. The nonlinearly-excited secondary wave components are phase-locked to\n\nthe primary wave components, thus causing deviations from Gaussian statistics, such\n\nas steep or asymmetric wave profiles (Norheim et al., 1998). If the harmonics are\n\nin phase with the fundamental, this will result in skewed velocity, if they are out of\n\nphase, the velocity will be asymmetric. Coincident with the shape transformation of\n\nthe incident ocean waves, the difference interactions also transfer energy to infragravity\n\nwaves (Herbers et al., 1994). This is depicted, for irregular waves, by the violet\n\nspectrum in Fig. 2.9, which has greater energy in the lower frequencies than in the\n\nfundamental-frequency range. This spectrum is typical of the swash zone, as the incident\n\nwaves and their superharmonics predominantly dissipate in the surf zone and thus\n\ninfragravity (lower-frequency) waves, even though they may partially reflect at the\n\nbeach, often dominate the wave run-up at the shoreline. The current state of the art\n\non the understanding of the wave and velocity nonlinearities is summarised in greater\n\ndetail in chapter 3.\n\n2.2.3 Infragravity waves\n\nMunk (1949) was the first to report low-frequency motions in the nearshore zone,\n\nwell outside the surf zone, which he called \u201csurf beat\u201d, suggesting their origin to be\n\nrelated to the variability of mass transport by the incident waves into the surf zone.\n\n14\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.2\n\nAlso known as infragravity waves (IG), subharmonic waves or, simply, long waves, these\n\nare waves with longer periods than the gravity (short) waves, of the order of 100 s.\n\nThe incident waves propagating towards the coast are organized in groups. The higher\n\nwaves in each group induce a larger mass transport than the lower waves and hence the\n\ndifference in the momentum flux causes a transfer of fluid from the higher waves to the\n\nlower ones, promoting the development of a \u201cset-down\u201d wave. This wave has the same\n\nperiod and length of the short-wave groups and, for wave groups propagating over a\n\nhorizontal bed, it is phase-locked and in anti-phase with the short-wave envelope, being\n\nthus called bound infragravity wave (Bie?sel, 1952; Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart, 1962,\n\n1964). The irregular waves, their envelope and the bound IG wave are represented in\n\nFig. 2.10.\n\nFor shoaling waves, the bound wave travels slightly slower than the wave groups,\n\nwhich causes an increasing phase lag as the depth diminishes, eventually resulting in a\n\nphase shift between IG waves and the wave groups. This phase shift (Masselink, 1995;\n\nJanssen et al., 2003) is a crucial mechanism of energy transfer from the short waves to\n\nthe bound IG wave. What happens to the bound waves in the end of shoaling/beginning\n\nof breaking is still a current topic of discussion in the research community. Many assume\n\nfrom the theory of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart (1962) that the bound IG waves are\n\nmostly released as free waves in the shoaling and breaking processes; others, such as\n\nBaldock (2012), argue that the amplitude of the bound IG waves may in fact decay\n\nfollowing short-wave breaking, but the former will only be released as free waves when\n\nthe water is shallow enough for the dispersion relationship to be satisfied for these\n\nwaves. At the shore, the IG waves can partially reflect off the beach and propagating\n\nseawards, as leaky waves, or become trapped at the coastline as edge waves (being\n\neither longshore progressive or standing).\n\nA second mechanism of IG-wave generation is also possible, directly related to the\n\nvariability of the short-wave breakpoint (Symonds et al., 1982). Resulting from the\n\nvarying amplitude of the incident waves (inducing slow oscillations in the wave setup),\n\nt (s)\n\nA\nm\np\nli\ntu\n\nd\ne\n\nEnvelopeIncident wave Infragravity wave\n\nFigure 2.10: Incident irregular waves and associated infragravity wave, in anti-phase with the wave\nenvelope.\n\n15\n\n\n\nSection 2.2 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\nthe breakpoint changes its location, acting similarly to a wave-maker, radiating free IG\n\nwaves at the group frequency (and their harmonics), both shorewards and seawards.\n\nArriving at the shoreline, infragravity waves can either be fully reflected seawards,\n\nbecome trapped at the coastline or dissipate. Battjes et al. (2004) found the normalized\n\nbed slope parameter, ?, to govern dissipation at the shoreline and defined this parameter\n\nas\n\n? =\nhx\n?\n\n?\ng\n\nh\n, (2.6)\n\nwith h and hx the characteristic values of depth and bed slope in the region considered,\n\n? = 2?f the angular frequency (with f the wave frequency) and g the acceleration\n\nof gravity. Large values of ? imply a nearly-full reflection at the shoreline, whereas\n\nfor small values of ?, reflections at the shoreline are small. When the waves do not\n\nfully reflect at the shoreline, part of the energy flux is directed shorewards and ends by\n\ndissipating.\n\nThe mechanisms involved in infragravity-wave dissipation are not yet a topic of\n\nconsensus in the research community. Bottom friction (Henderson &amp; Bowen, 2002),\n\nnonlinear energy transfers to and from infragravity waves (Henderson et al., 2006;\n\nRuju et al., 2012) and self-self nonlinear interaction of infragravity waves leading to\n\ninfragravity-wave breaking (van Dongeren et al., 2007; de Bakker et al., 2014) are likely\n\nto be significant dissipation mechanisms, with a distinct importance depending on the\n\nlocation along the cross-shore profile.\n\nEven though of much smaller amplitude in deep water than the short waves to\n\nwhich they are associated, the infragravity waves may modulate the propagation of\n\nthe short waves. They can become particularly important near the coast, where the\n\nenergy transfer becomes near-resonant and, consequently, infragravity-wave height can\n\naugment rapidly to over 1 m (Ruessink et al., 1998a; Se?ne?chal et al., 2011). In the\n\nswash zone, where the amplitude of the short waves becomes very small, the infragravity\n\nwaves can dominate the hydrodynamics, controlling the water depth.\n\n2.2.4 Swash zone\n\nWith a very different hydrodynamics from the rest of the beach profile, the swash zone\n\nis the limit between the aerial and the submerged beach areas which is intermittently\n\ncovered and exposed by wave action. For monochromatic waves this region is well\n\ndefined, while for irregular waves the maximum run-up (excursion of the waves up the\n\nbeach above the mean water level), down-wash (excursion of the waves down the beach\n\nbelow the mean water level) and set-up vary constantly in time.\n\nA large range of scales and types of fluid motion may be present in the inner-surf\n\n16\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.3\n\nzone, which subsequently govern shoreline oscillations and swash hydrodynamics. Fig.\n\n2.11 schematically represents the transfer of offshore energy into swash-zone oscillations.\n\nIf the surf zone is saturated (short-wave heights are depth-limited), the hydrodynamics\n\nin the inner-surf zone may be expected to be dominated by infragravity waves and\n\ncross-shore standing wave oscillations are usually observed at infragravity frequencies; if\n\nit is unsaturated (local wave height independent of depth), short-wave energy dominates\n\nthe inner-surf zone, with incident bores collapsing at the shoreline and propagating\n\nup the beach (Huntley et al., 1977; Guza &amp; Thornton, 1982; Wright &amp; Short, 1984;\n\nRaubenheimer et al., 1996). The wave energy dominating the swash zone is thus\n\ndependent on the relative magnitudes of short and IG wave energy in the inner-surf\n\nzone, that are in turn dependent on the offshore wave groupiness (which can be seen as\n\nthe offshore short-wave variability). The type of swash motion that prevails is ultimately\n\ndependent on the incident-wave conditions and beach morphology.\n\nIn natural beaches, high infragravity-energy levels, saturation and dissipation of\n\nshort-wave energy in the surf zone and saturation of bore-driven swash oscillations at\n\nshort-wave frequencies contribute to a dominance of IG-wave motion in the swash. For\n\nirregular waves, the swash motion at both low and high frequencies is also dependent on\n\nthe interaction between successive swash events and the interaction between standing\n\nwaves and incident bores (Elfrink &amp; Baldock, 2002).\n\nFigure 2.11: Schematic representing the transfer of offshore energy into swash-zone oscillations\n(Masselink et al., 2006).\n\n17\n\n\n\nSection 2.3 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\n2.3 Morphodynamics\n\nDifferent regimes of sediment transport can be identified, depending on the velocity\n\nof the fluid and the characteristics of the sediment (Nielsen, 1992). The sediment\n\ncan be transported (i) near the bed, as bed load, rolling and sliding, (ii) by saltation,\n\nan intermediate mode between suspension and bed load, when the sediments are\n\ntransported in suspension but impact the bed regularly, or (iii) as suspended load,\n\nwhen particles rest suspended in the water column during the transport and move\n\nwith the fluid. There is also the sheet-flow regime, a particularly intense mechanism\n\nof horizontal sediment transport near the bottom that includes the three modes of\n\ntransport previously mentioned (bed load, saltation and suspended load) and can be\n\nfound in different regions of the cross-shore profile, at sufficiently-high bottom shear\n\nstresses.\n\nThe balance between the different hydrodynamic processes acting over a given\n\nbeach profile determines the direction of the net sediment transport. Since the beach\n\nprofile evolves during the action of any given wave climate, it becomes particularly\n\ndifficult to evaluate the individual contribution of each hydrodynamic process to the\n\nsediment transport, as there are ever changing feedbacks between the morphology and\n\nthe hydrodynamics.\n\nThe energetics approach (Bagnold, 1963; Bowen, 1980; Bailard, 1981; Guza &amp;\n\nThornton, 1985; Russell &amp; Huntley, 1999) assumes the sediment transport rate to be\n\nproportional to the dissipation of energy near the bed and provides an equation for\n\nthe total (bed and suspended load) time-averaged immersed-weight sediment transport.\n\nThis approach can be used to estimate the relative contribution of the different terms\n\ncontaining powers of the instantaneous velocity, which can then be related to different\n\nsediment-transport processes. Initially, the instantaneous near-bed cross-shore velocity\n\nis decomposed into it mean, short and infragravity wave components, as\n\nu = u + u?, (2.7)\n\nwhere u? = u?S + u?IG, with u the total cross-shore velocity, u the mean flow component\n\nand u? the oscillatory component, which can be divided into u?S, the velocity associated\n\nwith the short waves and u?IG, the velocity associated with the infragravity waves. The\n\ntotal-load sediment transport equation can hence be obtained as\n\n?~qt? = ?Cf\n?B\n\ntan ?\n\n[?\n|~u|2 ~u\n\n?\n+\n\ntan ?\n\ntan ?\n\n?\n|~u|3\n?\ni?\n\n]\n+ ?Cf\n\n?S\nws\n\n[?\n|~u|3 ~u\n\n?\n+\n?S\nws\n\ntan ?\n?\n|~u|5\n?\ni?\n\n]\n,\n\n(2.8)\n\n18\n\n\n\nChapter 2.

The decomposition of the instantaneous near-bed cross-shore velocity will\n\nbe used later in this work to analyse the theoretical contribution of different mechanisms\n\nto the sediment transport.\n\nThe distinct hydrodynamic zones of the cross-shore profile are also zones with a\n\ndifferent balance between the several sediment-transport mechanisms. Therefore, the\n\nsediment transport processes at action in the shoaling zone, in the breaker and surf\n\nzones and in the swash zone, are subsequently described.\n\n2.3.1 Shoaling zone\n\nIf motions of very long period, such as the tidal currents, are ignored, in the\n\nshoaling zone there are two main mechanisms promoting sediment transport. At higher\n\nfrequencies, skewed waves induce high crest velocities in the onshore direction that\n\nmobilize and transport more sediment than the offshore-directed trough velocities\n\n(Hsu &amp; Hanes, 2004; Marin?o-Tapia et al., 2007). This is due to the fact that the\n\nboundary layer has less time to grow during the rapidly-accelerating half-cycle, inducing\n\nhigher (absolute) velocity gradients and shear stresses than in the half-cycle with less\n\nacceleration (Nielsen, 1992). However, under certain circumstances (such as relatively-\n\nsmall wave periods, finer grains, rippled beds) the existence of phase-lag effects may\n\nimply that, while the sediment may be put in suspension by the onshore phase of the\n\nwave cycle, it may not settle immediately, staying in suspension until the offshore stroke\n\nof the wave arrives, which contributes to an offshore transport.\n\nAt lower frequencies, even though infragravity waves are probably not capable of\n\nsuspending sediment, the velocities associated with these waves can advect sediment\n\nalready in suspension. In that sense, infragravity waves can be considered to behave\n\nanalogously to mean currents, advecting sediment suspended by short-wave action. In\n\nthe shoaling zone, the infragravity waves still bound to the wave groups contribute to\n\nan offshore transport, as the greater short waves of each group are concomitant with the\n\nnegative phase of the IG-wave cycle (Osborne &amp; Greenwood, 1992b). This transport\n\nis usually an order of magnitude smaller than the onshore-directed transport by the\n\nshort waves (Baldock et al., 2011) and, in a general way, velocity skewness dominates\n\nthe shoaling-zone sediment transport, which is mainly induced by bed-shear stresses\n\n(Ribberink et al., 2000).\n\n19\n\n\n\nSection 2.3 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\nBesides the two main mechanisms mentioned, the boundary-layer streaming and,\n\nnear the end of the shoaling zone, the wave asymmetry, can also contribute to an\n\nonshore sediment transport.\n\n2.3.2 Breaker and surf zones\n\nAs the waves approach breaking, new mechanisms start contributing to sediment\n\ntransport. Besides being skewed, waves become asymmetric as well. The incipient\n\nsediment motion can then be induced by fluid accelerations driven by pressure gradients\n\npromoted by the steep front faces of asymmetric waves (Drake &amp; Calantoni, 2001;\n\nCalantoni &amp; Puleo, 2006; Foster et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2011). Since more sediment is\n\nmobilized by the crests than the troughs, free-stream asymmetry possibly triggers a\n\nskewed shear stress in the boundary layer (van der A et al., 2010; Ruessink et al., 2011;\n\nBerni et al., 2013), further favouring the onshore sediment flux. Short-wave breaking\n\ncontributes both for picking-up sediment from the bed and to generate wave turbulence,\n\nboth contributing to picking up, entrainment and suspension of the sediment in the flow.\n\nResponding to the wave breaking, the undertow is the main mechanism transporting the\n\nsuspended sediment offshore (Marin?o-Tapia et al., 2007). The direction and magnitude\n\nof the infragravity-wave contribution to sediment transport in the breaker and surf\n\nzones are still currently under debate.\n\nInfragravity-wave motion in the surf zone can affect sediment transport in different\n\nways. Depending on the phase relationship between the infragravity waves and the short-\n\nwave groups, infragravity waves can have an important role modulating the propagation\n\nof the short waves. Especially in shallow waters, these long waves can significantly\n\nalter water depth, contributing to variations of the short-wave amplitude, which may\n\neventually induce changes in the breakpoint position. A concept of re-suspension\n\nmaxima (located at xr) can be defined, corresponding to locations of maximum bed\n\nshear stress and maximum suspended sediment concentrations, associated with relative\n\nwave height maxima. Fig. 2.12 illustrates this concept. Landward (seaward) of a\n\nre-suspension maximum, the net transport by infragravity waves is directed onshore\n\n(offshore), responding to the landward (seaward) infragravity-wave stroke (Aagaard\n\n&amp; Greenwood, 2008) that \u201cpicks up\u201d the sediment at the re-suspension maximum,\n\nwhere the sediment concentration is large, and advects it shorewards (seawards). The\n\ninfragravity-wave strokes directed towards (and not away from) the re-suspension\n\nmaximum (both from more seaward or more shoreward positions) do not encounter\n\nenough suspended sediment to advect.\n\nFurthermore, if a partially-standing wave is set up by reflection of infragravity waves\n\nat the shoreline, a second-order mass transport can be associated with the infragravity-\n\n20\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.3\n\nFigure 2.12: Observed net IG sediment fluxes plotted against the measurement position relative\nto the re-suspension maxima (xr ? x) for all experiments at Skallingen and Staengehus. Positive\nsediment fluxes depict a net onshore sediment transport and positive values of (xr?x) indicate that the\nmeasurement position was located landward of the re-suspension maximum (Aagaard &amp; Greenwood,\n2008).\n\nwave motion (if the motion is steady and the frequency well defined) (Vicinanza et al.,\n\n2011). Therefore, even if short waves are responsible for most gross sediment transport,\n\noverall, the morphological evolution depends on gradients in the sediment transport and\n\nthese can subtly change over the timescales of infragravity waves and wave groups. The\n\ncurrent state of the art on the role of IG waves in the sediment transport is described\n\nin greater detail in chapter 4.\n\nNearshore sand bars are a typical feature of the beach profiles which influences the\n\nevolution of the shoreline. Two hypothesis are currently proposed for sand-bar formation\n\n(Dally, 1987). The first hypothesis proposes that bars may form near the breakpoint of\n\nshort incident waves, resulting from the convergence of sediment transported onshore\n\nin the shoaling zone by the wave asymmetry, and offshore in the surf zone by the\n\nbed return flow. In this case, slow bar onshore migration and growth are driven\n\nby an asymmetry-induced transport, while mean-current-induced sediment transport\n\n(undertow) systematically contributes to offshore bar migration. Skewness-induced\n\ntransport can either drive onshore or offshore bar migration (Dubarbier et al., 2015).\n\nThe other hypothesis is that bars may be generated at the antinodes of standing\n\ninfragravity waves (infragravity-wave velocity nodes), as these represent locations of\n\npotential sediment convergence.\n\n21\n\n\n\nSection 2.3 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\n2.3.3 Swash zone\n\nAn important part of the littoral sediment transport occurs in the swash zone, with\n\nsediment concentrations that may typically be several orders of magnitude higher than\n\nin the inner-surf zone (Beach &amp; Sternberg, 1991). Offshore and onshore sediment\n\ntransport in the swash zone thus contribute significantly to shoreline accretion and\n\nerosion. The swash zone is characterized by strong and unsteady flows, high turbulence\n\nlevels, large sediment transport and rapid morphological change (Puleo et al., 2000).\n\nIn this zone, the net sediment transport is the result of two opposing quantities (the\n\ntransport during the uprush and the backwash), each of which is several orders of\n\nmagnitude higher than the resulting net transport, which makes it very difficult to\n\nmeasure and to model.\n\nSediment transport in the swash zone occurs predominantly under sheet-flow condi-\n\ntions, over a flat bed, with different forcing phenomena acting as sediment-transport\n\ncontrolling mechanisms, such as wave breaking and bore collapse, backwash, sediment\n\nadvection, infiltration/exfiltration effects, fluid-velocity asymmetries, infragravity waves,\n\nwave groups and acceleration asymmetry in the cross-shore flows. Fig. 2.13 offers a\n\nschematic summary of the processes at action and modes of sediment transport present\n\nduring a swash cycle.\n\nThe uprush is generally dominated by bore turbulence, especially on steep beaches\n\nFigure 2.13: Schematic representation of the sediment transport processes during a swash cycle\n(Masselink et al., 2006).\n\n22\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.3\n\nand in the lower-swash zone, with large shear stresses mixing the sediment higher in\n\nthe water column, which is then transported as suspended load. The velocity and\n\nlandward extent of the uprush is controlled by the forcing conditions in the surf zone,\n\nbeach gradient and sediment characteristics (Inch et al., 2015). Flow velocities are\n\nonshore-directed during the uprush, but flow in the lower-swash zone often reverses\n\nbefore the uprush has reached its maximum landward extent (Masselink &amp; Puleo,\n\n2006). Backwash flows are dominated by bed-generated turbulence (Petti &amp; Longo,\n\n2001; Cowen et al., 2003), accelerating under the forces of gravity and offshore-directed\n\npressure gradients (Baldock et al., 2001). Flow velocities are similar for both phases\n\nof the swash, but typically of unequal duration, with a longer backwash with slightly\n\nweaker velocities (Puleo et al., 2003; Masselink et al., 2005; Aagaard &amp; Hughes, 2006).\n\nThe swash motion is inextricably linked to the morphology of the beachface, whose\n\nmost characteristic feature is its gradient, steeper than the rest of the beach profile. Only\n\nwhen the uprush transports onshore the same amount of sediment that the backwash\n\ntransports offshore is a dynamic equilibrium reached between the beachface and the\n\nswash motion. The equilibrium gradient represents the balance between onshore swash\n\nasymmetry and the downslope gravity component (Hardisty, 1986), and the sediment\n\nsize is the most important factor controlling it. The sediment size influences the sediment\n\nfall velocity, but also the permeability of the bed and thus the in/exfiltration effects,\n\nwhich condition the sediment transport during the uprush and backwash phases of the\n\nswash motion. For a given sediment size, the equilibrium beachface gradient decreases\n\nwith the wave height and increases with the wave period (Dalrymple &amp; Thompson,\n\n1976).\n\nThe response of the beachface to changing hydrodynamic conditions can be under-\n\nstood in terms of how far the beach profile is, at each moment, from the equilibrium\n\nconditions that correspond to the hydrodynamic conditions. A net onshore sediment\n\ntransport will dominate when the beachface is too gentle, with the uprush moving\n\nmore sediment than the backwash, eroding the lower part of the beach and depositing\n\nthe sediment in the upper part. When the beach is too steep, the backwash will\n\ntransport more sediment than the uprush, eroding the upper part of the beach and\n\ndepositing the sediment in the lower part. The swash period will also be affected, as a\n\nsteepening/flattening of the beachface results in a decrease/increase of the swash period.\n\nThe beach gradient of the lower swash zone further controls the type of breaker or bore,\n\nthus playing an important role in the amount of turbulence and sediment suspension.\n\nHence, the processes of beachface steepening or flattening constitute a local feedback\n\nbetween swash hydrodynamics and beachface morphology and evolve continuously until\n\nthe beachface is in equilibrium with the wave conditions.\n\n23\n\n\n\nSection 2.3 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics\n\nNot only do the swash morphodynamics have their own feedback mechanisms, but\n\nthere also interact with the surf-zone morphodynamics. When the beachface is eroded,\n\nsediment is deposited in the surf zone, shifting the location of short-wave energy dissip-\n\nation from the lower beachface to the surf zone. This results in less short-wave-driven\n\nswash dynamics, as less short-wave energy reaches the base of the beachface. If, instead,\n\nsediment is transported from the surf zone to the beachface, short-wave breaking may\n\nhappen closer to the base of the beachface (as the local water depth increases), resulting\n\nin a shifting of the short-wave energy dissipation back to the swash zone, which will be\n\nexposed to higher short waves and more short-wave-driven swash dynamics. Moreover,\n\na change in the beachface gradient can modify the reflectivity of the beach, particularly\n\nfor IG waves, changing the amount of reflected infragravity-wave energy in the surf zone.\n\nIt is overall clear that the beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the surf\n\nzone and that the two zones are strongly linked though feedback processes (Masselink\n\net al., 2006).\n\n24\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nWave propagation and\n\nnonlinearities\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nUnderstanding nearshore morphodynamics implies a profound knowledge of the\n\nhydrodynamics and the complex interaction between motions at different spatial and\n\ntemporal scales. Along the cross-shore beach profile, as the surface gravity waves\n\npropagate from deeper waters to the shore, their shape changes, primarily due to\n\nnonlinear wave interactions (Elgar &amp; Guza, 1985; Doering &amp; Bowen, 1995) and further\n\non due to breaking. The nonlinear effects amplify the higher harmonics and cause the\n\noscillatory flow to transform from sinusoidal in deep water, through velocity-skewed\n\nin the shoaling zone, to velocity asymmetric in the inner-surf and swash zones. The\n\ninfluence of skewness and asymmetry on sediment transport is hard to study, because\n\nit is difficult to isolate those phenomena from other phenomena, such as the breaking-\n\ninduced turbulence, the undertow, etc. However, these nonlinearities are of paramount\n\nimportance for understanding sediment dynamics.\n\nIn addition to short-wave nonlinearities, the presence of IG waves and wave groups\n\nalso results in a wave-induced velocity and influences the short-wave hydrodynamics\n\nand larger-scale processes, such as the formation of standing waves or cross-shore and\n\nlongshore nodal structures both inside and outside the surf zone (Baldock et al., 2011).\n\nFurther, IG waves can themselves contribute to velocity skewness and asymmetry at low\n\nfrequencies, particularly for very-dissipative mild-slope beach profiles, where IG-wave\n\nshoaling and breaking can also occur (van Dongeren et al., 2007; de Bakker et al., 2014).\n\nThe role of short-wave nonlinearities on sediment transport has long been recognized.\n\nWave skewness was included in early analytical parameterizations of sediment transport\n\nand sand-bar migration numerical models (e.g. Stive, 1986). Later on, it was recognized\n\n25\n\n\n\nSection 3.1 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nthat, to improve model performance, particularly regarding onshore sand-bar migration,\n\nasymmetry should be considered as well. New parameterizations were proposed (e.g.\n\nDrake &amp; Calantoni, 2001; Elfrink et al., 2006; Abreu et al., 2010; Ruessink et al., 2012)\n\nand it became more clear how to include the effects of asymmetry. Finally, the first\n\nmodels capable of better representing onshore sand-bar migration have recently been\n\ndeveloped (e.g. Dubarbier et al., 2015; Ferna?ndez-Mora et al., 2015).\n\nA great effort has been put into finding parameterizations and models capable of\n\ncorrectly representing these nonlinear effects. Currently-used parameterizations still rely\n\nmostly on an exclusive dependency of nonlinearity on local wave conditions to describe\n\nskewness and asymmetry along the beach profile, even though with the precaution of\n\nassuming the parameterizations are only valid for a certain type of beach slope or range\n\nof offshore wave conditions. However, applying existing parameterizations to field data,\n\nRocha et al. (2013b) have suggested that defining Sk and As from local wave parameters\n\nonly is not enough, as the history of the wave propagation may also be important.\n\nFurthermore, other researchers have already underlined the importance of considering\n\ncharacteristics such as the offshore wave steepness (Dibajnia et al., 2001) and spectral\n\nbandwidth (Norheim et al., 1998), as well as the beach slope (Norheim et al., 1998;\n\nDong et al., 2014; Filipot, 2015), in order to correctly describe the wave nonlinearity\n\nat a given cross-shore position. There is, hence, a lack of thorough understanding of\n\nwhich factors may effectively condition the evolution of wave nonlinearities besides the\n\nlocal wave parameters (local wave height and period and water depth).\n\nTherefore, the aim of this chapter is to analyse wave propagation and improve its\n\ncomprehension with respect to wave and velocity nonlinearities. The evolution of the\n\nnonlinearities during the wave propagation towards the coast is explored in detail, for\n\na wide range of irregular and bichromatic wave conditions and different beach slopes.\n\nThe analysis is done for both free-surface elevation and velocity and comprises the\n\nentire beach profile, from the shoaling zone until the end of the swash zone. The main\n\nresearch questions explored are the following:\n\n? How do short-wave nonlinearities evolve along the beach profile, for different wave\n\nconditions?\n\n? How do infragravity waves influence short-wave propagation and short-wave\n\nnonlinearities?\n\n? What is the importance of infragravity-wave nonlinearities?\n\n? Which factors influence significantly wave and velocity nonlinearities?\n\n? How can current parameterizations of nonlinearity be improved?\n\n26\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\nThis chapter is divided into three main sections: physical modelling, numerical\n\nmodelling and parameterization of velocity nonlinearities. In the first section, a high-\n\nresolution data set gathered during the GLOBEX Hydralab IV project, held in the\n\nDeltares Scheldegoot in the Netherlands, is analysed. This section starts by describing\n\nthe experiments and preliminary data analysis. Then, the evolution of free-surface\n\nelevation and cross-shore velocity are analysed and compared between conditions,\n\nhighlighting the particularities of each wave condition and the differences between\n\nirregular and bichromatic wave groups. The importance of the lower frequencies is\n\nevidenced and thus the IG waves are regarded more thoroughly. The IG-wave separation\n\ninto incident and reflected components is discussed and a comparison is made between\n\nfree IG waves and IG waves that propagate associated with short-wave groups. In the\n\nlast part of this section, the analysis of the nonlinearities is done for free-surface elevation\n\nand velocity. From the analysis and comparison of the different wave conditions, it is\n\nsuggested that the evolution and maximal values of the nonlinearity may depend on\n\ncertain wave and beach characteristics.\n\nThe following section is based on the results of numerical simulations aimed at\n\nextending GLOBEX wave conditions, in order to unravel which wave or beach parameters\n\nare the most important in determining wave nonlinearities. These results, together\n\nwith the analysis of several field data sets, present new evidence of the dependence\n\nof nonlinearities on offshore wave parameters and beach slope. Hence, in the last\n\nsection of this chapter, an improvement to the Ruessink et al. (2012) parameterization\n\nis proposed, which takes into account new parameters and provides a better prediction\n\nof the nonlinearities for a wider range of beach slopes and wave conditions. The chapter\n\ndraws to an end with the conclusion.\n\n3.2 Physical modelling - the GLOBEX project\n\n3.2.1 The experiments\n\nThe laboratory data set used in this chapter was collected during the GLOBEX\n\nHydralab IV project (Ruessink et al., 2013; Michallet et al., 2014), held in the Scheldegoot\n\n(Fig. 3.1) in Delft, the Netherlands, in April 2012. The aim of this project was to collect\n\na high-resolution (in space and in time) data set of the cross-shore evolution of the short\n\nand infragravity waves in a very gently-sloping beach, for a range of wave conditions,\n\nincluding irregular, bichromatic and monochromatic waves. This data set was gathered\n\nfor the study of infragravity-wave dynamics, wave propagation and boundary-layer\n\ndynamics. In the scope of this thesis, the focus of the analysis of GLOBEX data is on\n\nthe wave propagation (in particular, on the wave nonlinearities) and on the interaction\n\n27\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nFigure 3.1: Deltares Shelde flume.\n\nof short waves and infragravity waves.\n\nThe GLOBEX beach had an impermeable concrete bed and was 110-m long and\n\n1-m wide, with an initial plain section of 16.57 m, followed by a slope of 1/80 until the\n\nend of the flume (Fig. 3.2). The shoreline was located at 84.57 m from the wave-maker\n\nposition at rest (x = 0), corresponding to a mean water depth above the plain section\n\nof 0.85 m.

IG waves are separated from short waves by\n\nfiltering the full signal at the cut-off frequency (fc). This frequency is defined, for the\n\nA series, by a minimum of the variance density spectrum of the free-surface elevation\n\nmeasured at the wave gauge closest to the wave-maker (de Bakker et al., 2014). For\n\nthe B series, this minimum is less marked, and thus half the peak frequency is used as\n\nfc (Janssen et al., 2003). Both ways of computing the fc lead to very similar values.\n\nFor all conditions, the cut-off frequency separates the range of frequencies that initially\n\nhave more energy and will tend to loose energy as the waves propagate towards the\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n-0.25\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\nt (s)\n\n?\n(m\n\n)\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx = 85.4 m\n\nx = 84.3 m\n\nx = 81.3 m\n\nx = 79.5 m\n\nx = 78.7 m\n\nx = 76.5 m\n\nx = 71.3 m\n\nx = 61.7 m\n\nx = 41.4 m\n\nx = 24.9 m\n\nt (s)\n\nu\n(m\n\ns-\n1\n)\n\nFigure 3.3: Free-surface elevation and velocity time series for the irregular-wave case A2, for different\ncross-shore positions (top: closer to the wave-maker, bottom: closer to the shore).

This pattern of convergence of multiple waves that can be seen along the time\n\nseries, reducing the number of short waves as the depth decreases, has been previously\n\ndescribed by Se?ne?chal et al. (2001) and van Dongeren et al. (2007). The velocity plots\n\nreflect the same evolution, with velocity changing from simple orbital motion to swash\n\nevents with marked uprush and downwash phases. The presence of wave groups and\n\nthe clear signature of the IG waves are also evident in the free-surface and the velocity\n\ntime series, for both irregular and bichromatic waves, progressively more marked as the\n\nwaves approach the shore.\n\nFig. 3.5 presents the velocity spectra for conditions A2 and B2, at five distinct cross-\n\nshore positions. For a beach as dissipative as the one considered in these experiments\n\n(1/80 slope), strong infragravity motion is expected to significantly contribute to the\n\nenergy spectra along the profile, in particular in the swash zone (de Bakker et al.,\n\n2015b). The spectra show that, for the two shoaling positions (x = 31.457 m and x =\n\n56.176 m), energy is concentrated mostly in the high-frequency range, with a clear peak\n\nat the peak frequency of the incident waves, for A2, and at the two main frequencies\n\n(f1 and f2), for B2. In the low-frequency end of the B2 spectrum, at all cross-shore\n\n31\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3.

As waves\n\npropagate closer to the shore in the inner-surf/swash zone, the velocity energy levels at\n\nfrequencies greater than 0.1 decrease approximately as f?5/3, which is consistent with\n\nan inertial sub-range, and energy is transferred to sub-harmonics, with energy levels\n\npeaking at infragravity frequencies. For the position further inshore, the low frequencies\n\nin the range of 0.04-0.08 Hz also start decaying following f?3, reflecting the possible\n\nsaturation and breaking of infragravity waves. For B2, a similar behaviour is observed\n\nof energy transfer from the main frequencies to higher frequencies in the shoaling, and\n\nto lower frequencies closer to the beach. However, for B2 the energy is preferentially\n\ntransferred to discrete frequencies, corresponding to multiples of the main frequencies\n\nand of their difference (f2 -f1) or sum (f1+f2), instead of spreading over a wide range\n\nof superharmonics and subharmonics.\n\nOverall, both the time series and the spectra depict the importance of IG waves\n\nin the GLOBEX gently-sloping beach, particularly in the swash zone. Therefore,\n\nunderstanding infragravity waves implies the analysis and treatment of data collected\n\nin the swash zone, an intermittently immersed zone, which is still a challenging issue,\n\nespecially for flow-velocity measurements.\n\n32\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\nAnalysis of swash velocities\n\nDuring the experiments, depending on the wave condition, free-surface elevation and\n\ncross-shore velocity measurements were performed in three to five cross-shore positions\n\nwithin the swash zone, spanning from the lower to the upper swash: x = 83.62 m, x\n\n= 84.29 m, x = 84.56 m, x = 85.39 m and x = 86.51 m from the wave-maker. The\n\nfact that the swash zone is, by definition, a zone which is intermittently covered by\n\nwater, means that any instrumentation positioned in this zone will be submerged during\n\ndiscrete periods of time. During this periods, the wave gauges will simply register zero\n\nvalues in the time series. Velocity measurements, however, will not be zero and, instead,\n\nthe parts of the signal corresponding to emersion periods will be noisy and present\n\nunrealistic values. It is thus necessary to follow a rigorous procedure in order to define\n\nwhich values are to be considered and which to be excluded from the velocity analysis.\n\nThe first step of swash data analysis consisted in synchronizing the cross-shore\n\nvelocity time series with the free-surface elevation time series measured at the closest\n\nwave gauge. The velocity time series were then de-spiked (Mori et al., 2007), as a\n\npreliminary way of eliminating spurious data points. Voulgaris &amp; Trowbridge (1998)\n\nhave shown that accurate ADV measurements can be difficult to obtain within a 1-\n\ncm distance of walls. Hence, the purpose of the following method is to evaluate the\n\nreliability of measurements performed very close to the bed, in the swash zone.\n\nThe first criterion for controlling the output of the ADVs was based on the free-\n\nsurface elevation relatively to the ADV control-volume height (of 11.8 mm). However,\n\nas the wave gauges were not always at the exact cross-shore position of the ADV and\n\nalso due to the occasional existence of resonant cross-modes in the transverse direction\n\nof the flume (van der A et al., 2013), the wave fronts depicted in the free-surface\n\nelevation measurements were not always exactly in phase with the sudden onshore-\n\nvelocity increase associated with the start of the uprush. Therefore, a beam correlation\n\n(Corr) and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criterion was applied to extend the valid\n\nvelocity points at the front (backwards in time for each swash event) that would be\n\nerroneously excluded if only the water-depth limit was considered. The chosen cut-off\n\nvalues were a minimum Corr of 70% (Puleo et al., 2012) and a minimum SNR of 20\n\n(Aagaard &amp; Hughes, 2006).\n\nThe Corr and SNR criterion was not considered appropriate for extending the\n\nvalid points in the end of the backwashes, as both varied significantly between values\n\nabove and below the defined cut-off thresholds during this part of the swash events.\n\nEven though, the water-depth limit was still allowing part of the backwash velocities to\n\nbe excluded, thus biasing parameters such as the velocity skewness and asymmetry and\n\nthe mean discharge. Hence, another criterion was applied to extend the number of valid\n\n33\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nmeasured points at the end of each swash event. The velocity values that had been\n\nexcluded by the water-depth criterion, but for which the water depth was still greater\n\nthan 1 mm, were replaced by a mean value obtained from the mean of the last 25 valid\n\npoints (corresponding to a mean of the last 0.19 s of measurement), and added to the\n\nend of each backwash, following the procedure of Raubenheimer et al. (2004). Fig. 3.6\n\nshows an example of the application of the method described to a swash time series of\n\nA2 wave condition. The mean discharge per run was used to check the validity of the\n\nvelocity selection method (if the velocity time series is accurate, the mean discharge in\n\nthe swash zone of an impermeable-bed beach must be the closest possible to zero).\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n?\n(m\n\n)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nu\n(m\n\ns?\n1\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nS\nN\nR\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nC\no\nr\nr\n\n2400 2450 2500 2550 2600 2650 2700 2750 2800\n-0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\nt (s)\n\nq\n(m\n\n3\ns?\n\n1\n)\n\nFigure 3.6: Example of the results obtained by the method for selecting swash events at x = 85.39 m,\nfor condition A2.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\nNormalization of wave energy\n\nIn order to describe the wave propagation along the beach profile, measures of the\n\nwave height, Hrms, and of the cross-shore velocity, urms, can be defined and calculated\n\nHrms =\nHs?\n\n2\n, (3.1)\n\nwhere Hs ? 4\n?\nm0, m0 =\n\n?\n(??), ? is the standard deviation and\n\nurms = ?u =\n?\n?u2?, (3.2)\n\nwhere ?.? is the time-averaging operator and u the cross-shore velocity time series. Fig.\n3.7 shows an example of the Hrms and urms trends that can be obtained along the beach\n\nfor A2 and B2, both for the total signal and for IG-frequencies only.\n\nSince the wave height and period are distinct for each wave condition simulated, the\n\nwaves do not shoal and break at the same cross-shore position for all the irregular and\n\nbichromatic wave conditions. Therefore, it is convenient to normalize the data, in order\n\nto better compare the results of the different wave conditions. The evolutions of wave\n\nheight, velocity or nonlinearities along the beach profile have consistent cross-shore\n\nstructures that depend on the position relatively to the breakpoint, which separates\n\nzones of the beach profile with different hydrodynamics. Thus, the breakpoint position\n\nis a natural scaling factor for most wave parameters. Wave breaking is also dependent\n\non the energy of each wave condition, and thus scaling the cross-shore position relatively\n\nto the breakpoint location is a way of normalizing the wave conditions in terms of\n\nenergy.\n\nThe breakpoint position is considered herein as the mean breaking location around\n\nwhich most waves break. For bichromatic wave conditions, since the waves generated\n\nhave always the same characteristics, the waves break at a few constant cross-shore\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n0\n\n5 \u00b7 10?2\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nx (m)\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n(m\n\n)\n\nA2\n\nA2 IG-only\n\nB2\n\nB2 IG-only\n\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nx (m)\n\nu\nr\nm\ns\n(m\n\ns-\n1\n)\n\nFigure 3.7: Cross-shore evolution of Hrms and urms, for A2 and B2, for the total signal and IG-\nfrequencies only. The dotted grey line represents the position of the still-water shoreline.\n\n35\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\npositions along the run and the breakpoint position can thus be determined more\n\neasily from the maximum wave height measured along the profile (or maximum Hrms).\n\nHowever, irregular waves do not always break at the same cross-shore position, depending\n\non the height and period of each individual wave. Larger waves break further offshore\n\nthan smaller waves and wave breaking occurs over a large region of the domain. This\n\nis further enhanced by the very gentle slope of the beach considered. Therefore, the\n\ndefinition of the breakpoint position based on the maximum wave height is less accurate\n\nfor A conditions and the energy-dissipation rate is used instead, as it is explained below.\n\nFirst, the energy-dissipation rate is calculated. The energy balance equation can be\n\nwritten as\n? (Ecg)\n\n?x\n= ???? = ? [??b? + ??f?] , (3.3)\n\nwith E the energy density, cg the group velocity (= cp, the phase velocity, in shallow\n\nwater), ?x the cross-shore distance along which the energy dissipates, ??b? the dissipation\nby breaking per unit area and ??f? the frictional dissipation, which is considered\nnegligible when compared with the dominant dissipation by wave breaking. Considering\n\nthat the waves in the end of shoaling/beginning of breaking are essentially frequency\n\nnon-dispersive and have a group velocity close to the shallow-water phase velocity,\n\nthe energy density and group velocity can be calculated following the linear-wave-\n\ntheory relationships (Thornton &amp; Guza, 1983). Hence, E = 1\n8\n?gH2rms, and the energy-\n\ndissipation rate\n\n??? = ?1\n8\n?g3/2\n\n?H2rmsh\n1/2\n\n?x\n. (3.4)\n\nAfterwards, the dissipation rate and the maximum wave height (Hrms,max) were\n\ncomputed for the three bichromatic-waves cases, in order to find a correspondence\n\nbetween both that can be used to define the breakpoint position for the irregular-wave\n\ncases. Fig. 3.8 represents the dissipation rates for A and B series. The greatest peak\n\ncorresponds to the breaking-induced dissipation and, thus, the start of the increase of\n\nthe dissipation rate towards the maximum value of this peak is linked to the beginning\n\nof the breaking process. For B conditions, the cross-shore position of the marked\n\ndecrease of the Hrms trends corresponds to the breakpoint position (xb). In terms of\n\nenergy dissipation, this position corresponds (for GLOBEX data set) to two thirds\n\nof the distance between the beginning of breaking and the maximum of dissipation.\n\nThis energy dissipation criterion is then used to define the breakpoint position for A\n\nconditions, for which it represents the start of breaking of the greatest waves (which\n\nbreak sooner than the smaller waves).\n\nHaving defined the breakpoint position for each wave condition, the cross-shore\n\ndistance can be normalized by the distance between the shoreline and the breakpoint.\n\n36\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Note: for B conditions, B1 (blue) and B2 (green) breakpoint positions are the\nsame and thus the blue line is not visible.\n\nThis can be expressed by the relative depth, hr which consists of the ratio between\n\nthe local water depth, measured in still water, at each cross-shore position (h) and the\n\nbreakpoint depth (hb). Both water depths are considered at rest. hr = 1 corresponds\n\nto the breakpoint position (separating the shoaling and the surf zones), while hr = 0\n\ncorresponds to the shoreline position. hr = 0.5 marks the separation between the outer-\n\nand the inner-surf zone.\n\n3.2.3 Cross-shore variation of free-surface elevation and velo-\n\ncity\n\nFig. 3.9 depicts the evolution of Hrms and urms as a function of the relative water\n\ndepth and highlights the differences between wave conditions. B conditions have greater\n\nshort-wave height than A conditions, with A2 (the A condition with greater short-wave\n\nheight) approaching the height of B3 (the B condition with smaller short-wave height).\n\nThe IG waves have marked wave-height maxima and minima for the B conditions,\n\nindicating that part of the energy is reflected at the shoreline. For A conditions,\n\nthe IG-wave height increases in the shoaling zone until breaking starts and remains\n\napproximately constant throughout the surf zone. A2, the wave condition of series\n\nA with the greatest Hrms, has also the greatest Hrms,IG. For all conditions, IG-wave\n\nheight decreases abruptly near the shoreline, mimicking short-wave breaking. Since\n\nhigher waves induce larger radiation stresses, set-up and set-down are greater for B\n\nseries, than A series, and for the wave conditions with higher total Hrms. IG waves\n\nare generally greater for A conditions, with an exception of B3, the B condition with\n\nmore modulation, which reaches at its maxima a greater height. Larger overall velocity\n\nis reached near the breakpoint, but IG-wave velocities are more important near the\n\n37\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3.

The velocity decrease in the surf zone follows the Hrms\n\ndecrease after breaking, for both A and B conditions. Mean velocity is mostly negative\n\nfor all conditions, reaching higher values at the end of breaking.\n\nFig. 3.10 shows the results of normalizing wave height and velocity for all wave\n\nconditions, which may reveal some other characteristics of the wave conditions that may\n\nbe hidden by the disparity in the initial wave height between conditions.

The A conditions show\n\na progressive decrease of Hrms that corresponds to the breaking of irregular waves along\n\na wide surf zone. The B conditions present a more marked Hrms decrease, with strong\n\nenergy dissipation, which is linked to the breaking of the waves along a narrow breaking\n\nzone. The greater modulation of B3 justifies its slightly gentler decrease of Hrms: it has\n\na greater variability of short-wave heights and thus a slightly larger dissipation zone\n\nthan B1 and B2.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\n(1991), as\n\nGF =\n\n?\n2?A\n?A(t)?, (3.5)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the short-wave envelope, ?.? represent the time-averaging\noperator and t the time. GF can be considered as a measure of the variability of short-\n\nwave height and has thus, inherently, a link between short and IG waves: greater IG\n\nwaves induce a greater modulation of the short-wave groups and thus a larger variability\n\nof short-wave height and vice-versa. Fig. 3.11 (top) shows the GF calculated for both\n\nA and B conditions, which is greater for A conditions: irregular-wave conditions have\n\nnaturally a larger variability of short-wave heights than bichromatic-wave conditions.\n\nAs found by List (1991), it is clear that, in contrast to the near-constant values\n\nof GF in deep water, wave breaking rapidly alters the groupiness of the wave-groups.\n\nFor irregular waves, there is a large decrease in groupiness for depths shallower than\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nG\nF\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n,I\nG\n\n00.5123\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nhr\n\nC\nro\nss\n-c\no\nv\na\nri\na\nn\nc\ne\n\no\nf\nA\n\na\nn\nd\n?\nI\nG\n\nFigure 3.11: Top: Groupiness factor along the beach profile.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\ntwice the breakpoint depth until the approximate limit between the outer and the\n\ninner-surf zones (hr = 0.5). Here, all the short waves have finished breaking and have\n\nsimilar heights, thus contributing to a minimum of wave-height variability (and thus of\n\ngroupiness). GF is higher before breaking, for A conditions, but for B conditions it\n\nreaches very similar (B3) and even greater (B1 and B2) values in the surf zone.\n\nA3 has slightly greater groupiness than A1 and A2 until the mid-surf zone. List\n\n(1991) found in his data that groupiness seems to be independent of bandwidth. Here,\n\nA3 has slightly greater values of GF than the other A conditions, which can either\n\nbe due to its more narrow-banded spectrum or lower wave steepness. B3 (greater\n\nmodulation) has, from deep water, a GF more than twice higher than the other B\n\nconditions. It also has larger oscillations of the GF values in the surf zone.\n\nList (1991) has suggested a possible model for justifying the existence of significant\n\ngroupiness within a saturated surf zone, which relates the short-wave interactions with\n\nIG-wave induced depth. This concept was also demonstrated earlier on by observations\n\nof a positive correlation between local IG oscillations and wave groups in the inner-surf\n\nzone (Guza &amp; Thornton, 1985; Abdelrahman &amp; Thornton, 1987). In order to further\n\nexplore this concept, Fig. 3.11 (bottom) depicts the evolution of the cross-covariance\n\nbetween the amplitude of the short-wave envelope (A) and the IG-wave motion (?IG)\n\nalong the beach profile.\n\nDuring most of the shoaling zone, the correlation between the wave envelope and\n\nIG-wave motion is near constant and negative, for A conditions, since the bound IG\n\nwaves are in anti-phase with the short-wave groups. However, for B2 and B3 conditions,\n\nthe presence of a local IG-wave node (offshore of hr = 2) results in a local de-correlation\n\nof IG-wave motion with the wave envelope. When the IG-wave height does not approach\n\nzero, the correlation remains high and negative until close to the breakpoint. The change\n\nfrom decreasing to increasing GF values just after the breakpoint, for B conditions,\n\nand in the mid-surf zone, for A conditions, is associated to the change of the correlation\n\nbetween A and ?IG from negative to positive values (near-zero values). For B conditions,\n\nthe change to positive values of correlation is done in a shorter distance than for A\n\nconditions. As it was observed before, dissipation is greater and happens over a shorter\n\ndistance for B conditions, which justifies the faster change of correlation. The positive\n\ncorrelation in the surf zone highlights the in-phasing of IG-waves and short-wave groups,\n\npreviously observed by Guza &amp; Thornton (1985); Abdelrahman &amp; Thornton (1987) and\n\njustifies the GF increase in this zone: due to the IG-wave induced depth, the highest\n\nshort waves can propagate at the crests of the IG waves and the smallest short waves at\n\nthe troughs, and thus short-wave height variability is promoted. For A conditions, the\n\ncorrelation remains positive and groupiness increases towards the end of the inner-surf\n\n41\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nzone. For B conditions, a return to negative values of correlation between the IG-wave\n\nmotion and the wave groups is observed near hr = 0.5, which is consistent with the\n\nwave reformation already mentioned. In the inner-surf zone, correlation between the\n\nwave groups and IG waves becomes positive again, as once more short-wave propagation\n\nis depth-modulated by the IG waves.\n\n3.2.4 Infragravity waves\n\nSeparation of incident and reflected IG waves\n\nThe standing IG-wave patterns observed for the bichromatic conditions result from the\n\ninterference between incident (ingoing) and reflected (outgoing) IG waves. Separating\n\nboth components helps understanding the contribution of each to the total IG-wave\n\nheight.\n\nThe incident/reflected IG-waves separation methods generally consider the IG waves\n\nas free waves. Close to the shore, in very-shallow water, IG waves are essentially free,\n\nbut in less-shallow water most IG waves are bound. Therefore, it is convenient to\n\nfirst separate bound from free IG waves, and then the incident free from reflected free\n\ncomponents.\n\nRuju et al. (2012) described in detail how the free-surface level of the incident bound\n\nwave generated by the difference interactions between two short-wave components can\n\nbe calculated using the formulation of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart (1962). The bound\n\nwave component can then be subtracted from the total IG-wave signal, to retrieve the\n\nfree IG waves. The free IG waves can subsequently be separated into incident and\n\nreflected components using different methods.\n\nGuza et al. (1984) developed a method for separating the IG-wave components from\n\nco-located free-surface elevation and velocity measurements, for which\n\n?IG\n\u00b1 =\n\n?IG \u00b1\n?\n\nh\ng\nuIG\n\n2\n, (3.6)\n\nwhere ?IG is the infragravity free-surface elevation, u is the infragravity cross-shore\n\nvelocity, h is the water depth and g is the gravitational acceleration. The incident\n\nand reflected components of the IG waves are separated based on their propagation\n\ndirection, which is inferred from the velocity signal, by comparison with the propagation\n\nvelocity that would be expect considering linear theory. This method assumes that the\n\nwaves are shore normal and other sources of infragravity energy, such as edge waves,\n\nare negligible, which is the case in the experimental flume. Also, it does not account\n\nfor the nonlinearity of bound waves and the influence of depth changes. van Dongeren\n\n42\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\n(1997) modified 3.6 to account for the fact that the incoming waves are predominantly\n\nforced and thus propagate at the group celerity. ?IG\n\u00b1 is then defined as\n\n?IG\n\u00b1 =\n\nc(?IG + ?) \u00b1 (h + ?)u\ncg + c\n\n, (3.7)\n\nwith the free IG-wave celerity c = sqrt(g(h + ?IG)), ? the steady set-up and cg the\n\ngroup velocity set equal to the linear group celerity of the primary waves at the peak\n\nfrequency (Ruju et al., 2012).\n\nThe Guza et al. (1984) method is the most widely used for separating incident and\n\nreflected IG waves: it is simple and gives good results (Sheremet et al., 2002; Ruju et al.,\n\n2012; Guedes et al., 2013; de Bakker et al., 2014). However, the need for co-located\n\nmeasurements of free-surface elevation and velocity hinders its application when velocity\n\nmeasurements are not available. This situation is very common, particularly when\n\nmeasurements are made over a mobile bed (with sediments, in experimental wave\n\nflumes and or the field) which complicates the obtainment of good and clean velocity\n\ndata. Since for the GLOBEX experiments high-resolution, in time and space, velocity\n\nmeasurements are available from x=24.87 m until the the shoreline, the Guza et al.\n\n(1984) method can be used to separate the IG-wave components for the analysis of the\n\nIG-wave propagation along most of the profile.\n\nIndependently of the method chosen, the first step for separating the different\n\ncomponents of the IG waves is to separate the bound waves from the free waves. In\n\ntheory, the bound-wave solution can only be assumed to work for horizontal beds, since\n\nin sloping beds the analytical solution is not known. Nevertheless, if a very-mild slope is\n\nconsidered, it can be assumed that, at the beginning of the slope, the wave shoaling will\n\nnot be significant, and thus the bound-wave solution can be extended a little further in\n\nthe cross-shore profile.\n\nFig. 3.12 shows the separation of B3 IG waves into their different components,\n\nfollowing different approaches: (i) the bound wave is subtracted from the total IG-wave\n\nsignal before separating incident and reflected components (G1) or (ii) the total IG-wave\n\nsignal is separated into incident and reflected components, considering all IG waves as\n\nfree waves (G2 and G3).\n\nEven though the initial Guza et al. (1984) method (before correction by van\n\nDongeren (1997)) considers all IG waves propagating as free waves, depending on the\n\nposition along the cross-shore profile, assuming all waves as free may or may not be\n\nreasonable. Until close to the breakpoint, bound waves are predominant (left plot in\n\nFig. 3.12). Further onshore, after breaking, IG waves tend to be free, as breaking helps\n\nreleasing IG waves from the short-wave groups. Moreover, the Hrms of the bound waves\n\n43\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3.

The dotted vertical lines mark the breakpoint position.\n\ncannot be correctly estimated from the bound-wave theoretical solution further onshore\n\nthan the inner-shoaling zone. The correction of van Dongeren (1997) to the Guza et al.\n\n(1984) method (G3) accounts for the fact that the group velocity, at which the bound\n\nwaves propagate, is smaller than the phase velocity, particularly in the shoaling zone\n\n(see Fig. 3.13). This correction considers that the incident waves are predominantly\n\nforced and thus modifies slightly the calculation of the incident and reflected IG waves,\n\nseeking a compromise between G1 and G2 options. G3 is subsequently used to compute\n\nIG-wave separation for all the wave conditions, as it is depicted in Fig. 3.14, for A3\n\nand B3. In the surf zone, for B conditions, some scatter is present resulting from the\n\ndispersion of the velocity measurements due to the transverse oscillation modes of the\n\nflume already mentioned before (van der A et al., 2013).\n\nIn the next section, model simulations run for GLOBEX wave conditions are presented.\n\nThe time series of the free-surface elevation at the first wave gauge was used as input\n\nwave condition to compared with the theoretical solution, and thus it was necessary to\n\nsubtract the reflected IG waves from the total IG-wave signal, since these are not present\n\nwhen the waves are generated by the wave-maker.

In grey, the total IG-wave signal, in\nblue/cyan and red/orange the incident and reflected components for Battjes et al. (2004)/van Dongeren\n(1997) method.\n\nare available at the first wave gauge (x = 6.96 m) and thus Guza et al. (1984) method\n\nfor separating the incident and reflected IG waves cannot be used.\n\nSeveral authors (e.g. Frigaard &amp; Brorsen, 1995; Baldock &amp; Simmonds, 1999; Battjes\n\net al., 2004) have used an array method in which the incident and reflected IG waves at\n\na certain location are estimated using only free-surface elevation measurements at a\n\nnumber of adjacent wave gauges. The amplitude and phase variation of each frequency\n\nharmonic between a reference gauge and another gauge is calculated assuming linear\n\npropagation and conservation of energy. The phase differences calculated allow the\n\nseparation of the incident and reflected components. The velocity of propagation is\n\nconsidered as\n?\ngh for both incident and reflected (free) IG waves. According to Battjes\n\net al. (2004), the low-frequency amplitudes calculated inside the surf zone are not\n\nexpected to be reliable as: (i) the approximation of the radiation-stress gradient by\n\nneglecting the contribution from the amplitude variation compared to that from the\n\nphase variation cannot be expected to hold in regions of short-wave breaking (and\n\nthis also implies that the breakpoint generation mechanism is not modeled); (ii) the\n\nenergy balance computed for the forced low-amplitude progressive IG waves assumes a\n\nsteady-state and absence of dissipation, assumption that is a priori invalidated by the\n\nenhanced low-frequency energy dissipation in the surf and swash zones; and (iii) the\n\nuse of small-amplitude theory for the translation of short-wave energy into radiation\n\nstress may not be accurate in the surf zone. Furthermore, there are conflicting demands\n\non the array length and the number and spacing of the wave gauges considered affect\n\nthe results. A minimal array length is required to obtain stable estimates and the\n\nassumptions of the method introduce larger errors in the separation results for longer\n\narrays. Several authors that have previously used this method do not describe clearly\n\neither how many gauges were used (van Dongeren et al., 2007), or why the choice of a\n\ndefined number of gauges (Dong et al., 2009). Even Battjes et al. (2004) do not provide\n\na thorough analysis of the sensibility of the method to wave-gauge number and spacing.\n\nFor defining the array length to be used, the results obtained with the methods\n\n45\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nof Guza et al. (1984), van Dongeren (1997) and Battjes et al. (2004) were compared.\n\nFor A conditions, an array length of about 4.5 m, with four gauges provided the best\n\nresults. The separation between each two consecutive gauges was taken as 1.5 m, which\n\nallows the reduction of noise in the results (stable estimates). For B conditions, as they\n\nare repeatable and the low-frequency energy is concentrated essentially at the f2 ?f1\nfrequency, a smaller array length is sufficient for well resolving the separation of incident\n\nand reflected waves and an array of three gauges with a length of 3 m resulted in the\n\nbest estimation. Since with Battjes et al. (2004) method the separation is carried out\n\nin the frequency domain, the Hm0 is computed from the spectra instead of the Hrms\n\ncomputed from the time series, and is presented in Fig. 3.14, for one irregular wave\n\ncondition and one bichromatic. Both methods are expected to present difficulties in the\n\nseparation of incident and reflected waves in cross-shore positions coincident with nodes\n\n(anti-nodes) of the IG waves, as this implies the existence of positions with near-zero\n\nfree-surface elevation (velocity) values. The similitude of the solutions validates the\n\nBattjes et al. (2004) formulation for separating IG-wave components offshore of the\n\nfirst velocity measurement available.\n\nFig. 3.14 illustrates well the differences between A and B conditions in terms of\n\nincident and reflected IG-wave components. For A conditions, the incident IG-wave\n\nheight increases progressively, until the edge of the outer-surf zone, following the total\n\nIG-wave signal. This IG-wave height increase is promoted by nonlinear energy transfers\n\nfrom the short waves (de Bakker et al., 2015a). The substantial difference in incident and\n\nreflected IG-wave height near the shoreline is indicative of strong IG-energy dissipation\n\nin very shallow water (de Bakker et al., 2014). The remaining reflected IG waves\n\ndecrease as they propagate offshorewards.\n\nFor B conditions, there is an abrupt decrease of incident IG-wave height in the\n\nouter-surf zone, followed by an increase in the inner-surf zone. The minimum of incident\n\nIG-wave height at around hr = 0.5 is coincident with the short-wave reformation\n\nobserved at this location (see Fig. 3.9). As it was observed for A conditions, B\n\nconditions also show a substantial difference between incident and reflected components\n\nnear the shoreline, but reflected waves do not significantly decrease while propagating\n\noffshorewards. Depending on the cross-shore position, the total IG-wave height, for B\n\nconditions, has the contribution of both incident and reflected components.\n\nComparison with the monochromatic IG-wave case\n\nTo comprehend how IG-wave motion can correlate and influence short waves, it\n\nis important to understand the propagation of the IG waves themselves. In order to\n\ndo so, the C1 monochromatic IG-wave condition was especially designed to allow the\n\n46\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\nvisualization and analysis of the propagation of free monochromatic IG waves. Fig.\n\n3.15 shows the comparison of the Hrms and urms and also Hrms,IGinc and Hrms,IGref of\n\nthe C1 condition with the IG waves of the B2 and B3 conditions (designed to have\n\nthe same IG wave period as C1). Since the C1 condition does not have a short-wave\n\nbreakpoint like other conditions, the x axis is not normalized by hb.\n\nThe partially-standing wave patterns observed for the B2 and B3 IG waves are\n\nalso present for C1 condition. It is notable, however, that whereas C1 wave height\n\nprogressively increases along the cross-shore profile, reaching a maximum rather close\n\nto the shore, B2 and B3 IG waves reach their wave-height maxima sooner in the profile,\n\njust after the onset of short-wave breaking.\n\nSeparating the incident and reflected IG-wave components helps better understanding\n\nthe differences between the IG waves associated with the bichromatic waves and the\n\nfree IG waves of C1. The incident IG waves have a very distinct evolution between\n\nthe B and the C cases until close to the shoreline. For B conditions, in the shoaling\n\nzone, incident IG-wave height markedly increases due to the strong nonlinear coupling\n\nwith the short waves (and thus, due to the energy transfer to the IG waves) (Sheremet\n\net al., 2002), reaching a maximum height near the shoreward limit of the the outer\n\nsurf-zone, where the mean radiation stress assumes maximal values (Ruju et al., 2012).\n\nAs the short waves start breaking, IG-wave energy dissipation starts, which is seen as a\n\ndecrease of the incident IG-wave height in the outer-surf zone, until the mid-surf zone.\n\nAs Baldock (2012) proposed, this might be due to the onset of short-wave breaking: as\n\nthe highest short-waves of the groups break, the short-wave-height variability within the\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n,I\nG\n\n(m\n)\n\n10 30 50 70 90\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx (m)\n\nu\nr\nm\ns\n,I\nG\n\n(m\ns-\n1\n)\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n,I\nG\nin\nc\n(m\n\n)\n\n10 30 50 70 90\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\nx (m)\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n,I\nG\nr\ne\nf\n(m\n\n)\n\nFigure 3.15: Hrms,IG and urms,IG (left), Hrms,IGinc and Hrms,IGref (right) along the beach profile,\nfor B2 (green circles), B3 (red circles) and C1 (black pluses) wave conditions.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nwave groups is reduced, which implies a smaller difference in momentum flux between\n\nthe higher and the smaller waves and thus a decrease of the amplitude of the bound IG\n\nwaves. In the same zone of the beach profile, there is a small reformation of short-waves,\n\nwhich then decrease again towards the shore. In the inner-surf zone, self-self IG-wave\n\ninteractions develop, dominating the interactions close to the shore (de Bakker et al.,\n\n2014). This IG interactions induce higher harmonics that lead to shoaling of the IG\n\nwaves (which is seen by an increase of the incident IG waves in the inner-surf zone,\n\nparticularly notorious for B3) and promote a shape transformation of the IG waves to\n\nasymmetric (Rocha et al., 2013a). The IG waves thus end up by breaking, which is\n\npotentially the dominant mechanism of IG-wave dissipation in this zone of the beach\n\nprofile (van Dongeren et al., 2007; de Bakker et al., 2014). B3 has greater IG-waves,\n\ntherefore IG-wave self-self interactions can be expected to be more significant, justifying\n\nthe larger growth of the incident IG waves in the inner-surf zone comparatively to B2.\n\nFor both B2 and B3, incident IG waves have a sudden height decrease near the coast (at\n\nx ? 80 m), which is accompanied by a significant cross-shore velocity increase. These\nare trends typically observed for the short-wave height at the end of the shoaling zone,\n\nbefore breaking (Fig. 3.9), which reinforces the idea of IG-wave breaking.\n\nUnlike for B conditions, C1 incident waves grow regularly along the beach, only\n\ndecreasing near the coast, in the same region where B2 and B3 incident IG waves were\n\nshown to break. The wave-height increase for C1 is only linked to the progressive\n\nshoaling of the free IG waves. Without a coupling to short-waves, no local increases or\n\ndecreases of wave height are expected for this wave condition, since no energy transfers\n\nfrom (in the shoaling) or to (in the surf zone) short waves are possible. Nevertheless, C1\n\nincident wave height still decreases abruptly near the shoreline, which is concomitant\n\nwith a IG-wave velocity increase, like it was observed for B2 and B3 conditions, once\n\nagain supporting the theory of IG-wave breaking initially proposed by van Dongeren\n\net al. (2007).\n\nThe reflected IG-wave component of C1 gradually decreases with increasing distance\n\nfrom the shoreline, consistent with both dissipation and refractive trapping (Sheremet\n\net al., 2002). For B conditions, the same behaviour is clear only in deeper waters,\n\nbeyond the breakpoint. Near the breakpoint there is even a slight increase (especially\n\nfor B3), which can probably be attributed to the contribution of IG waves generated by\n\nthe time-varying breakpoint mechanism (Baldock et al., 2000).\n\n48\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\n3.2.5 Analysis of wave nonlinearities\n\nEvolution of skewness and asymmetry\n\nAnalysing the evolution of wave nonlinearities along the beach profile is a way to track\n\nthe changing of the wave shape during wave propagation. Skewness and asymmetry\n\nare essentially a result of the generation of harmonics of the fundamental frequency\n\n(or frequencies, for B series), in- or out-of-phase with it, respectively. Therefore, the\n\nevolution of skewness and asymmetry values along the beach profile are a proxy of the\n\ninteractions between frequency pairs.\n\nSkewness and asymmetry of the free-surface elevation can be computed from the\n\nwave-gauges measurements as\n\nSk? =\n?(? ? ??)3?\n\n?3?\n, (3.8)\n\nwhere ?.? is the time-averaging operator and ?? the free-surface elevation standard\ndeviation. The asymmetry is calculated according to Kennedy et al. (2000),\n\nAs? =\n?H (? ? ??)3?\n\n?3?\n, (3.9)\n\nwhere H is the imaginary part of the Hilbert transform. Velocity skewness and\n\nasymmetry are analogously calculated (Eqs. 2.4 and 2.5), replacing the free-surface\n\nelevation time series by the cross-shore velocity time series.\n\nFig. 3.16 shows the evolution of Sk and As, for the free-surface elevation and\n\ncross-shore velocity, for all irregular and bichromatic wave conditions.\n\nFor A conditions, the typical trends of nonlinearity can be observed, with the\n\nabsolute values of skewness and asymmetry increasing until the middle of the surf zone,\n\nwhere most of the short waves finish breaking and decreasing then towards the inner-\n\nsurf zone. Near the coast, when the contribution of the IG-waves becomes significant,\n\nnonlinearity increases again, responding to the shoaling of the IG waves themselves.\n\nFor B conditions, the global Sk and As trends observed for the A conditions are\n\nperturbed by multiple local maxima and minima. The cross-shore position of the first\n\nlocal maximum of Sk, corresponds to that of the first breaking of the bichromatic-wave\n\ngroups and is associated with a return of As values to close to zero, which marks the\n\nend of the main breaking region for B conditions. The local maximum of Sk near hr\n\n= 0.5 that is followed by a local maximum of asymmetry is probably linked to the\n\nreformation of short-waves observed in Fig. 3.9. The Sk and As increase closest to\n\nthe shoreline follows the one observed for A conditions and is linked to the IG-wave\n\n49\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3.

A3 has greater skewness than the other A conditions, approaching the greater\n\nvalues of the B conditions;\n\n? the multiple Sk and As peaks observed for B conditions have different amplitudes,\n\nsuggesting different forcing mechanisms;\n\n? the first and third Sk and As peaks of B conditions are related to the first breaking\n\nof the short waves and (potentially) to the reformation observed near hr = 0.5,\n\nrespectively;\n\n? B3 reaches greater absolute As and Sk values than the other B conditions in the\n\ninner-surf/lower-swash zones.\n\nFor A conditions, the same behaviour and differences between conditions observed\n\nfor Sk? and As? are also present for Sku and Asu, although with smaller absolute\n\nvalues.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\nouter-surf zone are less evident and not always in phase with those of Sku and Asu.\n\nThe larger modulation of B3 promotes a higher correlation between short-wave action\n\nand IG wave motion, which affects the evolution of skewness and asymmetry along\n\nthe beach profile. The conversion from free-surface elevation to velocity skewness and\n\nasymmetry is explored in the following subsection.\n\nRetrieving velocity nonlinearities from free-surface elevation nonlinearities\n\nFig. 3.17 shows the comparison between the Sk and As of free-surface elevation and\n\nthe Sk and As of velocity for one irregular-wave condition, A1, and one bichromatic-\n\nwave condition, B1. Except for some particular peaks for the B conditions in the surf\n\nzone, the velocity nonlinearity trends follow the free-surface elevation trends, but with\n\nlower absolute values. Particularly for skewness, the difference is of the order of 40%,\n\nfor A conditions, and 30%, for B conditions. The lower values of Sku and Asu result\n\nfrom the attenuation of the high frequencies (and thus of the superharmonics) of the\n\nvelocity signal throughout the water column, as predicted by the linear wave theory\n\nfor intermediate depth (Dean &amp; Dalrymple, 1991). The similarity of the trends of\n\nfree-surface elevation nonlinearities and velocity nonlinearities (Fig. 3.17) suggests that\n\nthe nonlinearities of the velocity time series may potentially be retrieved (by means of\n\nthe linear wave theory) from the free-surface elevation time series, in particular for A\n\nconditions.\n\n?0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nS\nk\n\nSk?\nSku\n\n012\n?2.5\n\n?2\n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\nhr\n\nA\ns\n\nAs?\nAsu\n\nFigure 3.17: Free-surface elevation (blue) and velocity (cyan) skewness (top) and asymmetry (bottom)\nfor A1 (dotted lines) and B1 (solid lines).

(2011) have considered the shallow-water wave theory, corrected\n\nto the second-order, to estimate velocity from free-surface elevation measurements.\n\nHowever, they show that, although the trends are well captured, the absolute values\n\nof Sku and Asu are under- and over-predicted, respectively. The high frequencies,\n\nwhich greatly contribute to Sku and Asu, are attenuated with depth. Therefore, an\n\nexpression aimed at retrieving correctly a velocity time series from free-surface elevation\n\nmeasurements, must include a dependence on the position in the water column at which\n\nthe velocity is calculated. Hence, instead of considering the shallow-water wave theory,\n\nthe linear wave theory is considered at intermediate depths, for which a dependence on\n\nwater depth is included as follows\n\nu? =\n?\ni\n\nui = ?i\ncosh(kiz0)\n\nsinh(kih)\n, (3.10)\n\nwhere the index i represents each of the frequencies that are transferred from the\n\nfree-surface elevation time series to the velocity time series, k is the wave number\n\n(= 2?/?, with ? the wave length), z0 is the height above the bottom at which u? is\n\ncalculated, and h is the local water depth. k is obtained from the dispersion relation,\n\nwhich can be expressed, for each frequency, as\n\n?2i = gki tanh(kih), (3.11)\n\nwith g the gravitational acceleration and where ?i = 2?fi is the angular frequency\n\nand fi each wave frequency considered. Fig. 3.18 shows the comparison of Sku and\n\nAsu obtained from the velocity measurements (uE) and from free-surface elevation\n\nmeasurements (u?), using Eq. 3.10, for A1, A3, B1 and B3.\n\nFor A conditions, the estimated values of Sku and Asu are very close to the measured\n\nones until the inner-surf zone, from whereon the linear wave theory fails to predict\n\ncorrectly the velocity from the free-surface elevation measurements. Sku is predicted\n\nwith a very small error of less than 1%, for A1, and less than 5%, for A3, until its\n\nmaximum value. Beyond that position, u? overestimates Sku. For the Asu of A1 and\n\nA3, the trend predicted by u? is almost totally accurate until near the maximum value.\n\nIn the case of B1, the Sku trend is still fairly well followed until the end of the outer-surf\n\nzone, but for B3, u? does not predict correctly the oscillations of the measured Sku in\n\nthe shoaling zone. This is due to the fact that the presence of reflected IG waves is not\n\naccounted for in u? and for B3 these waves are more important and thus the error in\n\nthe estimation of Sku and Asu is larger.\n\nOverall, u? can be used to estimate Sku and Asu for irregular waves and for bichro-\n\nmatic wave groups with small modulation until the water becomes too shallow (beyond\n\n52\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

According\n\nto this approach, the time-averaged bed-load and suspended-load sediment transports\n\nare proportional to four velocity moments: the process-related moments\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nand?\n\n|u|3 u\n?\n, and the moments related to the gravity terms\n\n?\n|u|3\n?\n\nand\n?\n|u|5\n?\n. The cross\n\nshore structure of each velocity moment can thus be used to investigate some of the\n\ndifferent processes influencing sediment transport. Guza &amp; Thornton (1985) have shown\n\nthat the most important terms in the cross-shore transport equation are those included\n\nin the third and fourth velocity moments,\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nand\n\n?\n|u|3 u\n\n?\n, respectively. Russell\n\n&amp; Huntley (1999) presented a detailed analysis on the relative contributions of short\n\nwaves, IG-wave motions and mean flows and interactions between the three to the\n\n53\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\ntotal structure of the moments using the normalized third-order velocity moment. This\n\nmoment was chosen for having a clearer cross-shore structure, being statistically more\n\nrobust, and its expansion into individual terms being easily coupled with well-known\n\nsediment transport mechanisms.\n\nTo study the relative importance of short and IG waves on nonlinearity effects, the\n\ninstantaneous near-bed cross-shore velocities can be split into a mean velocity term\n\n(u) and an oscillatory term (u?). The latter can be further separated into high and low\n\nfrequency components, corresponding to the short (u?S) and infragravity (u?IG) orbital\n\nmotion,\n\nu = u + u?S + u?IG. (3.12)\n\nThe third-order velocity moment can then be computed, resulting its decomposition\n\nin ten terms which can be related to different hydrodynamic processes (Table 3.2).\n\nEach term can then be normalized by the velocity variance (wave energy), following\n\nTable 3.2: Terms resulting from the decomposition of the third-order velocity moment.\n\nSk0 u\n3 mean velocity\n\nSk1 ?u?3S? skewness of short waves\nSk2 3?u?2Su?IG? correlation of short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity\nSk3 3?u?2IGu?S? correlation of IG-wave variance and short-wave velocity\nSk4 ?u?3IG? skewness of IG waves\nSk5 3?u?2S?u stirring by short waves and transport by mean flow\nSk6 3?u?2IG?u stirring by IG waves and transport by mean flow\nSk7 6?u?Su?IG?u three-way correlation\nSk8 3?u?S?u2 time-average of short-wave oscillatory component\nSk9 3?u?IG?u2 time-average of IG-wave oscillatory component\n\nWells (1967), Bailard (1981) and Doering &amp; Bowen (1987), enabling the comparison of\n\ndata collected under different energy conditions (Russell &amp; Huntley, 1999). Fig. 3.19\n\npresents the evolution along the cross-shore beach profile of the six most relevant terms\n\n(the mean velocity has already been analysed and Sk7, Sk8 and Sk9 are approximately\n\nzero).\n\nA strong dependency of hydrodynamic processes on the distance to breakpoint\n\nis evident, with markedly different behaviours offshore and onshore of the breakpoint\n\nposition. In the shoaling zone, the dominant term is the short-wave skewness (Sk1),\n\nalthough there is also a contribution from the terms Sk2 (larger in the outer-shoaling\n\nzone) and Sk5 (larger in the end of the shoaling zone). For A conditions, the greater\n\nshort-wave skewness of A3 is evident. For B conditions, two Sk1 local maxima are\n\nvisible, at the cross-shore positions of the first and third total Sk? peaks mentioned\n\n54\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Asterisks represent the A conditions and circles the\nB conditions. Blue, green and red colours represent conditions 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The dotted\nvertical lines mark the breakpoint and shoreline positions.\n\nbefore (and shown in Fig. 3.16) and attributed to the existence of the first breaking\n\nand of a short-wave reformation zone in the mid-surf zone. In the case of B3 condition,\n\nthe second Sk1 peak is much smaller than for the other two B conditions. For B3,\n\nwith greater modulation (and thus greater IG waves), the relative contribution of the\n\nshort-wave skewness to the total skewness is smaller than for the other two conditions.\n\nThis highlights the fact that, depending on the modulation, the contributions of high\n\nand low frequencies to the nonlinearities, at any given cross-shore position, can be\n\ndifferent. Still in the shoaling zone, the correlation between short-wave variance and\n\nIG-wave velocity (Sk2) is negative: under non-breaking wave conditions the largest\n\nshort waves appear under the bound IG-wave trough (see Figs. 3.3 and 3.4). For B3,\n\nthis correlation is also negative but oscillates responding to the IG-waves maxima and\n\nminima.\n\nAfter the breakpoint and until the end of the surf zone, short-wave skewness (Sk1)\n\ncontinues to be positive but diminishes, reaching zero values near the shoreline. The\n\nterm corresponding to the stirring by short waves and transport by mean flow (Sk5)\n\ncontributes to negative skewness, with the most negative value at about half the\n\nbreakpoint depth. This is a result of the negative mean cross-shore velocity in the\n\nsurf-zone, associated with the undertow (see Fig. 3.9). The correlation of short-wave\n\nvariance and IG-wave velocity (Sk2) gradually becomes zero towards the end of the\n\n55\n\n\n\nSection 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nouter-surf zone and then becomes slightly positive for A conditions in the inner-surf zone,\n\nwhere the short-wave propagation is controlled by the water depth at each moment. For\n\nB conditions, the correlation between short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity varies\n\ndepending on the wave condition and responding to the cross-shore IG-wave height\n\npatterns. In the case of B3, the positive correlation maximum observed in the surf zone\n\nis located at the cross-shore position of the second total Sk peak depicted in Fig. 3.16.\n\nFrom the inner-surf to the upper-swash zone, the IG waves start to clearly dominate\n\nthe hydrodynamics. IG-wave stirring and transport by mean flow becomes increasingly\n\nmore negative until close to the shoreline (Sk6). At the transition from surf to swash\n\n(around hr = 0), with the formation of IG-wave bores that propagate towards the\n\nupper-swash zone, the skewness of IG waves becomes positive (Sk4) and a weak onshore-\n\ndirected mean-flow effect is also present (Sk6). As short waves propagate associated\n\nwith the IG-wave bores, the correlation of short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity\n\n(Sk2) reaches greater and positive values. A small contribution from IG-wave variance\n\ncorrelation with short-wave velocity also plays a role in the swash zone (Sk3).\n\nSumming up, in the shoaling zone, Sk1, Sk2 and Sk5 (the terms strongly dependent\n\non short waves) dominate, which is in accordance with the findings of Russell &amp; Huntley\n\n(1999) and Marin?o-Tapia et al. (2007), who also observed the terms Sk1 and Sk2 to be\n\npositive and negative, respectively, offshore of the breakpoint. However, the positive\n\nvalues perceived by these authors for the term Sk5 in the shoaling zone, are not found\n\nherein, where a negative mean velocity has a stronger signature, leading to negative\n\nvalues. This leads to a distinct behaviour of the overall velocity skewness when compared\n\nwith the shape function of Marin?o-Tapia et al. (2007). In the surf zone, the results\n\nobtained are also in agreement with previous findings, with a predominance of negative\n\nskewness. This is only strictly true when Sk1 becomes much smaller than Sk5 and Sk6,\n\nwhich happens for depths shallower than half the breakpoint depth, for A conditions,\n\nand still further onshore, for B conditions. Sk5 is dominant in the outer-surf zone and\n\nSk6 in the inner-surf zone. The swash zone is dominated by terms Sk2, Sk4 and Sk6,\n\nlinked to the IG-wave motion.\n\nFig. 3.19 further highlights the difference between short-wave skewness for condition\n\nA3 and the other A conditions, as well as the significant discrepancy of the correlation\n\nbetween short-wave variance and IG-wave motion, for condition B3, relatively to the\n\nother B conditions. Moreover, it underpins the existing link between short waves and\n\nIG waves. As Janssen et al. (2003) have shown, in the shoaling zone, the correlation\n\nbetween IG and short waves is negative, as the IG waves are in anti-phase with the wave\n\ngroups. After the breakpoint, this correlation increases to positive values, which are\n\ngreater in the swash zone, where the water-depth modulation of short-wave propagation\n\n56\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2\n\nimplies a positive correlation between IG-wave crests and the highest short waves of\n\nthe groups (as shown before in Fig. 3.11).\n\n3.2.6 Summary\n\nFew measurements are currently available from experiments performed on beaches\n\nas gentle-sloping as the GLOBEX beach. In this section, a detailed analysis of the wave\n\n(and velocity) nonlinearities was carried out, as well as some reflexions on the behaviour\n\nof the infragravity waves and their interaction with the short waves. The very-gentle\n\nslope makes it possible for wave nonlinearities and infragravity waves to fully develop\n\nas the short-wave propagate towards the shore. The comparison between irregular and\n\nbichromatic waves has also highlighted some particularities of the bichromatic waves,\n\nwhich merit to be more thoroughly looked at in the future. The main remarks of this\n\nsection are subsequently presented.\n\nIrregular waves have a broader surf zone than bichromatic waves, for which breaking\n\nis stronger and happens over a narrower surf zone. Therefore, bichromatic waves reach a\n\ngreater maximum energy-dissipation rate than irregular waves. The latter have smaller\n\nundertow velocities, but greater urms and urms,IG.\n\nThe wave evolution is influenced by the relation between short-wave groups and\n\nIG waves (which can also be seen in terms of wave groupiness). In the shoaling zone,\n\nthe tendency is for IG waves to be in anti-phase with the short-wave groups. In the\n\ninner-surf/swash zones IG-waves are in phase with the short-wave groups, influencing\n\nshort-wave propagation by depth-modulation of the water level. For A conditions the\n\ntrends are linear, for B conditions the picture is more complex, due to the existence of\n\nsignificant IG-wave reflection at the shore and of a short-wave reformation zone in the\n\nmid-surf zone.\n\nIG waves propagating together with short-wave groups (B conditions) evolve towards\n\nthe shore differently from free IG waves (C1). This is due to the interactions with the\n\nshort-wave groups, which are absent for C1 case. It seems likely, for both B and C1\n\ncases, that part of the IG waves shoal and break near the shore.\n\nFew data sets have such a high resolution of velocity measurements as the GLOBEX\n\ndata set. Frequently, the description along the beach profile of the velocity nonlinearities,\n\nwhich are directly related to sediment transport, is hindered by a lack of velocity\n\nmeasurements. Hence, making use of the high-resolution data set presented, a method to\n\ncalculate velocity nonlinearities from free-surface elevation measurements was proposed\n\nand validated. This method is based in the linear wave theory at intermediate depths\n\nand takes into account the attenuation of the high frequencies of the wave throughout\n\nthe water column.\n\n57\n\n\n\nSection 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nThe evolution of the wave nonlinearities varies depending on the wave condition\n\nconsidered. Irregular waves and bichromatic waves have distinct behaviours along the\n\ncross-shore profile. For irregular waves, higher total wave height results in greater\n\ncross-shore velocities and IG waves. The largest values of skewness and asymmetry were\n\nobserved for A3, which has both a more narrow-banded spectrum and a smaller wave\n\nsteepness than the other A conditions. Modulation of the short-wave nonlinearities\n\nby the IG waves is particularly evident for B conditions and more marked for B3, the\n\nwave condition with the greatest IG waves. Depending on the cross-shore position\n\nrelative to the breakpoint, different mechanisms contribute to the wave nonlinearity.\n\nShort-wave motion is more important in the shoaling zone, while the mean flow only\n\nbecomes relevant in the surf zone. The very-gentle slope of the beach promotes the\n\nexistence of a large surf zone for irregular waves, which can be divided into the outer-\n\nand the inner-surf zones, with the maxima of skewness being reached between the\n\ntwo. Asymmetry reaches its highest values closer to the shore. The contribution of the\n\ninteraction between short-waves and IG-wave motion to the nonlinearity varies along\n\nthe beach profile. The IG waves dominate the nonlinearities of the inner-surf and swash\n\nzones for all wave conditions.\n\nThe next two sections of this chapter are dedicated to exploring further the factors\n\ninfluencing the evolution of the nonlinearity of the waves.\n\n3.3 Numerical modelling - SERR1D model\n\nField data can help identifying the drawbacks of different parameterizations. If\n\nthe number of instrument is high enough, these data can even be used to follow wave\n\npropagation and transformation towards the coast. However, the scarce number of\n\ninstruments available in most field campaigns often hinders the complete description of\n\nthe wave evolution, particularly offshore of the surf zone. Furthermore, wave conditions\n\nand the beach profile cannot be controlled and data is not always exploitable for\n\na specific purpose. To overcome these difficulties inherent to field work, laboratory\n\nexperiments can be made, where scaled physical models allow a greater control over the\n\nvariables aimed to be studied, while representing the most important hydrodynamic\n\nand morphodynamic processes as close as possible to nature. Wave conditions can be\n\ncarefully controlled and the beach can be designed as wished. Notwithstanding, it is a\n\nlong and expensive process to get accurate and pertinent measurements, and a limited\n\namount of wave conditions can be run, frequently over one single beach profile (the\n\nslope remains constant).\n\nTherefore, even though numerical models often present not only numerical limitations\n\n58\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3\n\nbut also limitations related to the state-of-the-art of the knowledge of the processes\n\nto be modelled, they are useful tools, as they allow the experimenting of many wave\n\nconditions and beach types in less time (and less money!) than physical models or field\n\nexperiments.\n\n3.3.1 Model description\n\nSERR1D is a fully-nonlinear 4th-order finite-volume Boussinesq-type model (Cien-\n\nfuegos et al., 2006, 2007). This model is based on the Serre equations, which describe\n\nthe 2D irrotational and shallow-water flow of an incompressible and inviscid fluid over\n\nuneven bottom bathymetries. This set of equations defines the total water depth\n\nand the depth-averaged horizontal velocity. The depth-averaged mass and momentum\n\nconservation equations can be written in their generic form, according to\n\n?h\n\n?t\n+\n\n?\n\n?x\n(hu) ?Dh = 0, (3.13)\n\nand\n?u\n\n?t\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n\n?u2\n\n?x\n+ g\n\n?h\n\n?x\n+ ?d ?\n\n1\n\nh\nDhu +\n\n?b\n?h\n\n= 0, (3.14)\n\nwhere h is the water depth, u is the depth-averaged horizontal velocity, Dh and Dhu\n\nrepresent the extra terms that take into account the wave-breaking process, ?d groups\n\nall the high-order dispersive (non-hydrostatic) terms, g is the gravitational acceleration,\n\n? the water density and\n\n?b =\n?\n\n2\nCfu |u| , (3.15)\n\nwith Cf the bed-friction coefficient (similarly to that used by Grant &amp; Madsen (1979));\n\nx is the space coordinate, in the cross-shore direction and t is the time coordinate.\n\nFor Boussinesq models to represent well the surf zone, breaking criteria must be\n\nadopted to turn on/off breaking dissipation. The breaking initiation/cessation criterion\n\nis based on threshold values of the breaker front slope, ? (Schaffer, 1993). In SERR1D\n\nmodel, the breaking terms are included in both the mass and momentum conservation\n\nequations. The breaking term in the mass-conservation equation takes into account\n\nthe mass deficit induced by depth-integration up to the wave trough, as an attempt to\n\ninclude wave-roller effects. The overall dissipation of organized wave energy is derived\n\nusing nonlinear shallow-water shock theory, which is corrected to account for dissipation\n\ntaking place only over a finite cross-wave extent. The breaking-induced terms are thus\n\ndescribed as\n\nDh =\n?\n\n?x\n\n[\n?h\n?h\n\n?x\n\n]\n(3.16)\n\n59\n\n\n\nSection 3.3 Chapter 3.

In particular, the wave-breaking model\n\nwas calibrated by Cienfuegos et al. (2010) with the case of Ting &amp; Kirby (1994) spilling-\n\n60\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3\n\nbreakers experiments.\n\nHerein, a good compromise between the numerical performance of the scheme and\n\npredicted properties of surf-zone waves is achieved by setting: (i) the relative breaking-\n\nwave height to 0.8 at the beginning of breaking (?b) and 0.7 at the end (?f ), (ii) the\n\nbreaker angles (?b, for breaking initiation and ?f , for breaking cessation) to 26\u00b0 and 6\u00b0,\n\n(iii) ? = 0.1, (iv) ?b = 5.0, (v) the empirical parameter for the roller length, to 0.796,\n\n(vi) the coefficient for the transitional time scale Tb = 5.0, (vii) the friction coefficient\n\nCf = 0.001 (calculated with the Grant &amp; Madsen (1979) parameterization) and (viii)\n\nthe grid resolution parameter ? = dx/h0 = 0.05 (where dx is the spatial grid spacing,\n\nand h0 the water depth at the wave-maker). The values used for the parameters are\n\nwithin the range proposed by Cienfuegos et al. (2010). Since the friction coefficient\n\ndepends on the bed roughness, this parameter can be changed for data sets obtained\n\non different beaches, as long as it is kept within a reasonable range.\n\n3.3.2 Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sets of parameters chosen for A and B conditions, respectively, were used in all\n\nmodel runs of this section and were chosen as a compromise that works fairly well for\n\nboth narrow- and broad-banded irregular-wave cases (A1 and A3) and more modulated\n\nand less modulated bichromatic wave cases (B1 and B3). Since herein the main focus\n\nin on the evolution of wave nonlinearity along the beach profile (accounting for both\n\nshort- and infragravity-wave propagation), Hrms and Sk? are considered as control\n\nvariables and calibration was done with a special emphasis on getting the best values\n\nsimultaneously for both.\n\nThe B parameter can be calculated according to Ruessink et al. (2012), as\n\nB =\n?\nSku\n\n2 + Asu\n2. (3.24)\n\nSince it combines both velocity skewness (Sku) and asymmetry (Asu), this parameter\n\nconstitutes a measure of the total (non-dimensional) nonlinearity and is thus analysed\n\nas well. The emphasis of this analysis is on its maximum value, Bmax, which represents\n\nthe maximum value of nonlinearity reached by each condition along the beach profile.\n\nTime-series length\n\nIn the case of irregular waves, the time series that are input to the model as boundary\n\nconditions need to be long enough to allow the statistical convergence of the results. At\n\nthe same time, longer input time series imply a longer computation time. Therefore, a\n\ncompromise must be reached between computation time and statistical convergence. In\n\n61\n\n\n\nSection 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\norder to do so, simulations with different time lengths were run and the sensitivity of\n\nHrms of both total and infragravity waves and Sk? to the length of the run was analysed.\n\nFig. 3.20 shows both variables zoomed at the profile zones where their values are more\n\naffected by the run length. The greatest difference observed between the results of the\n\nruns with different time lengths is of the order of 6%, for the Hrms of the IG waves, and\n\nis reduced to less than 1% for the runs with a time length of at least 1500 s. Therefore,\n\nwe will consider that any run that has a length of more than 1500 s can be used for\n\ncomputing wave statistics for A conditions accurately. Since for B conditions the waves\n\nare bichromatic, shorter time series are needed to get statistical convergence: shorter\n\nruns, of 500 s, still provide accurate results.\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\n0.06\n\n0.065\n\n0.07\n\n0.075\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n(m\n\n)\n\nx (m)\n30 40 50 60 70 80\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n,\nI\nG\n\n(m\n)\n\nx (m)\n74 76 78 80\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\n\nS\nk\n?\n\nx (m)\n\n \n\n \n\nExp\n\nTf =500 s\n\nTf =1000 s\n\nTf =1500 s\n\nTf =2000 s\n\nTf =2500 s\n\nTf =3000 s\n\nFigure 3.20: Sensitivity of the wave statistics to the length of the runs (A1 example). Spatial\ndistribution off Hrms, Hrms,IG and Sk? in the zones of the cross-shore profile where these variables\nshow a greater variation depending on the run length.\n\nBoundary conditions\n\nTwo different types of input time series were tested: one obtained experimentally\n\nand the other obtained theoretically. From the total free-surface elevation time series\n\nmeasured at the first wave gauge (x = 6.96 m), the reflected IG waves were extracted\n\n(using the Battjes et al. (2004) separation method already described, since no velocity\n\nmeasurements were available at this position), and the input signal arriving from the\n\nwave-maker was retrieved. This time series constituted the experimentally-obtained\n\ninput wave time series (A1E, for condition A1). The theoretical time series were\n\ncomputed using the second-order wave-maker theory for irregular waves (Scha?ffer, 1996),\n\nconsidering for A conditions both 1000 and 2000 different frequencies (e.g., A1T and\n\nA1T2, for condition A1). For B conditions, only the main two frequencies (f1 and f2)\n\nwere considered for computing the bound wave and the higher harmonics (B1T, for\n\ncondition B1). Figs. 3.21 and 3.22 show the input time series and spectra of A1, A3,\n\nB1, B3 wave conditions.\n\nThe evolution of different wave statistics along the beach profile, spectra and time\n\nseries calculate at different cross-shore positions are analysed for both types of input time\n\nseries. For A conditions, the two theoretical input time series, T (computed with 1000\n\nfrequencies) and T2 (computed with 2000 frequencies), are considered in the analysis.\n\n62\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Grey lines - experimental data; dark blue - A1E; blue - A1T; cyan - A1T2.\nThe blue crosses in Sku and Asu figures were calculated from the velocity time series obtained from\nA1T free-surface elevation time series, with the u? method (see subsection 3.2.5).\n\nthus it is set up to represent more accurately A than B conditions. Using the same set\n\nof wave-breaking parameters for all wave conditions simulated implies the existence of\n\nsome discrepancies between experimental and numerical results, particularly in what\n\nconcerns breaking initiation and inner-surf/swash zone nonlinearities.\n\nFor A conditions, free-surface elevation trends are well represented by the model, as\n\nwell as the wave phasing and nonlinearity until the swash zone (Figs. 3.23 and 3.25).\n\nSmall differences can be seen between the runs forced with theoretical (A1T and A1T2)\n\nand experimental (A1E) input conditions, particularly for A1 in the inner-surf and\n\nswash zones, a result of the higher IG-wave energy observed for the experimental-input\n\nruns, relative to the experimental data (Fig. 3.24).\n\nThe three most obvious inaccuracies of the model on the simulation of A conditions\n\ncan be observed for As?, urms and Sku statistics (Figs. 3.23). The general shape and\n\nmaximum of As? are captured by the model, but in order to represent correctly the\n\nHrms decrease due to wave breaking and the Sk? evolution along the profile, the set\n\nof breaking-model parameters chosen delays the beginning of the increase in wave\n\nasymmetry. This increase, associated with the breaking process, is reproduced by the\n\n64\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nat a certain height above the bed and compared to the model outputs that correspond\n\nto a velocity integrated over the entire water column. Near the bottom, the velocity is\n\nexpected to be lower and less skewed than near the surface. Sku is hence overestimated\n\nin about 16%, for A1, and 22%, for A3. In the shoaling zone, the model overestimates\n\nthe energy of the velocity frequencies higher than the peak frequency, but it is accurate\n\nfurther onshore.\n\nIn order to overcome the limitation of the model in the simulation of the velocity,\n\nthe method described in section 3.2.5 for estimating the velocity from the computed\n\nfree-surface elevation (u?) can be used to retrieve urms, Sku and Asu, especially for\n\nirregular-wave conditions (blue dots in Fig. 3.23).\n\nComputing the theoretical solution with 1000 or 2000 frequencies (difference between\n\nT and T2 input time series, Fig. 3.23 and Fig. A.1 of Appendix A), does not improve\n\nsignificantly the statistics. Thus, since computing the theoretical solution with 2000\n\nfrequencies is more time consuming, new theoretical irregular-wave conditions defined in\n\nthis section were obtained using a theoretical solution that considers only interactions\n\nbetween 1000 frequencies.\n\nKeeping the same wave-breaking parameters that were calibrated for the irregular-\n\nwave conditions for the bichromatic waves, makes it difficult for the model to accurately\n\nsimulate all the nuances of the evolution of the nonlinearities of the B conditions (see\n\nAppendix A). A small change of ?b (from 26\u00b0 to 27\u00b0) and ?f (from 6\u00b0 to 9\u00b0) helps better\n\nrepresent the existence of a second breaker region, but does not fully resolve the correct\n\nrepresentation of skewness and asymmetry trends. The model slightly underestimates\n\nset-down and overestimates set-up. It tends to overestimate as well the mean energy\n\nlevel of B conditions and small differences in the Hrms,IG at the first wave gauge (around\n\n2% for B1) can increase along the beach and influence the simulation of IG-wave height\n\ncloser to the coast and the position of the Hrms,IG maxima and minima, for the B\n\nwave conditions. When the amplitude modulation is greater (the case of B3), these\n\ndifferences affect also the skewness evolution, in particular the skewness peaks that\n\ncorrespond to short-wave modulation by IG waves. Nevertheless, the model represents\n\naccurately the energy and frequency of the most important frequencies. This allows it\n\nto still represent the general trends of free-surface elevation and velocity sufficiently well,\n\ntogether with the first and second skewness peaks, which are correctly represented in\n\nterms of amplitude (only the first one) and cross-shore location (both). The difficulties\n\npresented by the model in the simulation of only some of the skewness peaks reinforce,\n\nonce again, the idea that the various skewness peaks do not have all the same origin.\n\n66\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3\n\nFriction coefficient\n\nSince the bottom friction is beach dependent, it is difficult to estimate a priori,\n\nand an adjustment can be made for each beach modelled. Therefore, a sensitivity\n\nanalysis was performed for a range of resonable values (Grant &amp; Madsen, 1979) for\n\nthe GLOBEX case. Fig. 3.26 shows the effect of changing Cf on Hrms and Sk?, for\n\nboth A1 and B1. Keeping the friction coefficient value at a minimum of 0.001 allows a\n\nbetter representation of the onset of wave breaking and thus of the maximum skewness\n\nvalues as well. The value of 0.001 was chosen as a compromise that allows the best\n\nrepresentation of the decrease of Hrms during wave breaking, the increase of Hrms,IG in\n\nthe inner surf/swash zones, and the shape and maximum value of Sk? evolution along\n\nthe profile, for A1. Since it depends mostly on the bottom roughness, which is the same\n\nfor all runs, the same value was considered for all A and B conditions.\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n,\nt\no\nt\na\nl\na\nn\nd\nI\nG\n\n(m\n)\n\nA1\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nx (m)\n\nS\nk\n?\n\nExp\n\nCf =0.001\n\nCf =0.002\n\nCf =0.003\n\nCf =0.004\n\nCf =0.005\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\nB1\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nx (m)\n\nFigure 3.26: Evolution of Hrms and Sk? along the cross-shore profile considering different Cf values.\nThe dashed lines in the Hrms plot represent the IG-waves.\n\nWave-breaking parameters (?b, ?f, ?b, ?f)\n\nAs wave nonlinearity and wave breaking are tightly linked, the breaking process\n\n(initiation, duration and cessation) must be reproduced by the model as close to the\n\nexperimental data as possible. The sensitivity of the model to the choice of the breaking\n\nparameters is therefore very important and is subsequently analysed. All the sensitivity\n\nanalysis is presented for A3. A particular attention is paid to the threshold values\n\n(corresponding to breaking initiation and cessation) of the two main physical parameters\n\n67\n\n\n\nSection 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nthat can be set in the breaking model, ? and ?. Hrms and urms of both all frequencies\n\nand IG-waves only, mean water level, mean cross-shore velocity and skewness and\n\nasymmetry of both free-surface elevation and cross-shore velocity, as well as Fourier\n\nspectral analysis, were used to check the model sensitivity to the choice of the breaking\n\nparameters. The analysis presented herein is focused on the control variables mentioned\n\nbefore (Hrms of total and IG-waves only, Sk? and Bmax), which account for total and\n\nIG wave height and nonlinearity.\n\nEach parameter was varied independently, keeping the other three at their default\n\nvalues. The angles for breaking initiation and cessation were varied within a range of\n\n\u00b1 4\u00b0 around the default values (?b = 26\u00b0 and ?f = 6\u00b0). The value of ?b was increased\nfrom 0.7 to 1, being 0.7 the default value of ?f ; inversely, the maximum ?f was defined\n\nas the default value of ?b and the minimum to 0.50. This range of values was chosen for\n\nrepresenting breakers of the spilling type in realistic relative water depths (Cienfuegos\n\net al., 2010). The effect of varying the breaking-model parameters on the skewness and\n\nHrms of the waves is shown in Fig. 3.27.\n\nAs expected, changing the breaking parameters results in no significant changes\n\nuntil the very end of the shoaling zone. In the surf zone, both Hrms and Sk? are more\n\nsensitive to the variation of the parameters controlling the start of breaking than the\n\ncessation of breaking. However, even in the case of varying ?b (the parameter with\n\na greater effect on the control variables) from the minimum to the maximum value\n\nconsidered, the computed Hrms does not change significantly, with the breakpoint\n\nposition shifting onshore only about 3 m. The skewness is sensitive to the variation\n\nof the breaking-model parameters, particularly regarding its maximum value (since\n\nthe shape is, in all A cases, well modelled); an exception is the variation of ?f , which\n\nessentially conditions the Sk? of the waves in the swash zone, and only when increased\n\nbeyond 8\u00b0.\n\nFig. 3.28 presents the variation of the Bmax value as a function of the different values\n\nchosen for the four physical breaking-model parameters, ?b, ?f , ?b and ?f . Regarding\n\nthis parameter (Bmax), varying ?b can result in a change of about 22%, which can be\n\nreduced to as little as 4% if ?b is only changed by \u00b1 1\u00b0 or to about 11%, for a \u00b1 2\u00b0\nchange. Similarly, Bmax can oscillate about 11% with ?b within a range of 0.7 to 1,\n\nreducing to 5% if a range of \u00b1 0.05 around the default value is considered. The Skmax\nvaries only about 11% when ?f , always assuming inferior values relatively to the default\n\n?b, is changed between 0.55 and 0.8. However, in the case of Bmax, the variation of ?f\n\ninduces a change of 20%, almost as important as the variation of ?b.\n\nConsidering the parameter to which the nonlinearity is more sensitive, ?b, the results\n\nshow that changing it up to 15% (\u00b1 2\u00b0) around its default value, results in a variation\n\n68\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Along those experiments the beach slope was kept constant. Thus,\n\nit is convenient to validate the chosen set of model parameters for other experiments\n\nrun over a different beach. This is particularly important since the model will be used\n\nto investigate the influence of the beach slope on wave propagation.\n\nThe van Noorloos (2003) experiments (vN2003) consisted of different irregular and\n\nbichromatic wave conditions run over a 40 m-long fixed-bed beach with a 1/35 slope\n\nstarting at x = 8.5 m, from the wave-maker. The irregular-wave conditions C-1 (Tp\n\n= 2.0 s, Hm0 = 0.05 m) and C-3 (Tp = 2.0 s, Hm0 = 0.1 m), ran during 40 min, were\n\nchosen to validate SERR1D model for four main reasons: (i) most wave conditions\n\nsimulated with SERR1D are irregular-wave conditions and thus it is more important\n\nto validate the model firstly for irregular waves; (ii) the Tp considered is within the\n\nrange of GLOBEX A conditions tested; (iii) C-3 Hm0 is the same as for A1 and A3;\n\nand (iv) C-1 has a smaller Hm0 than GLOBEX conditions (and thus smaller steepness\n\nthan GLOBEX waves), offering an idea of the possible behaviour of SERR1D model\n\nwhen it is forced with wave conditions beyond the range of GLOBEX wave conditions.\n\nC-1 condition is particularly useful since some wave conditions that were simulated for\n\nhighlighting the influence of the different parameters on wave propagation imply forcing\n\nthe model with wave conditions significantly different from the conditions for which\n\nit was calibrated in this work (GLOBEX A1 and A3 conditions). The wave-breaking\n\nparameters were kept equal to GLOBEX runs and only the friction coefficient was\n\nincreased from 0.001 to 0.002 to better represent IG-wave energy in the beach of vN2003.\n\nFor C-1 condition, two input time series were considered: one obtained directly from\n\nthe wave gauge measurements (C-1E) and another obtained theoretically (C-1T). As\n\nthe wave-maker of vN2003 experiments did not have the capacity to absorb IG waves\n\ncoming from the beach, IG-wave height is enhanced from the beginning until the end\n\nof the experiments. Thus, C-1E input time series provides more accurate results than\n\n70\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3\n\nC-1T, as it includes the enhanced IG waves.\n\nFig. 3.29 shows that, with no change of the wave-breaking parameters, SERR1D\n\nrepresents sufficiently well the mean water level and the wave height (both of total\n\nand IG waves only) of vN2003 C-1 and C-3 experiments. The small differences found\n\nbetween the measured and the simulated skewness maxima for C-3 (already visible\n\nfor A3 GLOBEX condition relatively to A1 GLOBEX condition) can be halved by\n\nchanging ?b by only 2\u00b0 (shown in Fig. 3.29, similarly to what was shown for GLOBEX\n\nB conditions). The free-surface elevation asymmetry maximum is found around 2 m\n\nfurther onshore for numerical results than for experimental data, which was already\n\nseen to be a limitation of the model with GLOBEX data as well.\n\n0\n\n0.03\n\n0.05\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n,\nt\no\nt\na\nl\na\nn\nd\nI\nG\n\n(m\n)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nS\nk\n?\n\nExp\n\nC1E\n\nC1T\n\n10 15 20 25 30\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx (m)\n\nA\ns\n?\n\n0\n\n0.03\n\n0.05\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\nExp\n\n?=26\u00b0\n\n?=27\u00b0\n\n?=28\u00b0\n\n10 15 20 25 30\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx (m)\n\nFigure 3.29: Evolution of free-surface elevation statistics along the cross-shore profile, for C-1 and C-3\nwave conditions of vN2003.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nwave nonlinearities. The default beach chosen was similar to the GLOBEX beach, with\n\nthe exception of the initial plane section of the bed, which was shortened (in about\n\n7 m) to reduce computation time. The wave conditions simulated were scaled from\n\nprototype and represent typical wind- and swell-waves conditions: wave heights from\n\n0.6 to 2.6 m and wave periods from 7 to 17 s, with offshore spectral bandwidths that\n\nvary from very-broad to very-narrow banded. This range of wave conditions can be\n\nobserved along the year, for example, in the west coasts of Europe, where Summer\n\nwaves have easily half a meter height and periods as short as 7 s and present commonly\n\nbroad-banded spectra and Winter high-energy swell waves having more narrow-banded\n\nspectra and reaching frequently heights of 2.6 m and periods up to 17 s.\n\nIn order to better characterize the range of wave conditions that will be analysed, the\n\nUrsell (eq. 3.25) and Iribarren (eq. 3.26) numbers can be calculated, as they describe\n\nconveniently the characteristics of the waves and the beach slopes over which they\n\npropagate. The Ursell number is used herein as in Ruessink et al. (2012),\n\nUr =\n3\n\n4\n\nawk\n\n(kh)3\n, (3.25)\n\nwith aw = 0.5Hs, k the local wave number computed with the linear theory using\n\nT = m0/m1, where mn is the spectral moment of order n, and h is the local water depth.\n\nThe Iribarren number is calculated following Iribarren Cavanilles &amp; Casto Nogales\n\n(1949),\n\nIb =\ntan(?)?\n\nHs\nL\n\n, (3.26)\n\nwhere Hs is the local significant wave height calculated for the duration of the time series,\n\nL is the local wave length computed with the linear wave theory using T = m0/m1\n\nand tan(?) the beach slope. For calculating the Iribarren number offshore (or at the\n\nwave-maker), the offshore values of Hs and L are considered.\n\nFig. 3.30 shows the distribution, in the Ur0 (Ur at the wave-maker) and Ib0 (Ib at\n\nthe wave-maker) space, of all the irregular-wave conditions simulated. It also illustrates\n\nthat the synthetic wave conditions analysed in the following section have Ur and Ib\n\nnumbers similar to or within the range of the experimental wave conditions of GLOBEX\n\nand vN2003 experiments. Therefore, the good results obtained by SERR1D in the\n\nsimulation of these experimental data support its usage for simulating a wide range of\n\nwave conditions in which the subsequently-analysed wave conditions are included.\n\nFor the wave conditions considered, the spectra at the first wave gauge and the results\n\nin terms of Hrms, Sk? and As? evolutions and Bmax values are presented subsequently.\n\n72\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nwith the skewness increasing fast over a short cross-shore distance, while bigger waves\n\nreach a lower maximum skewness (around 74% lower), but stay skewed along a greater\n\ncross-shore distance and reach larger asymmetry than very short waves. The overall\n\nnonlinearity diminishes by 42% when the wave height is increased fourfold.\n\nThe input Hm0 was limited to 0.13 m, because the model runs became unstable when\n\ngreater offshore wave heights were chosen (without changing the values of the other\n\nwave and beach parameters nor those of the breaking model). Slightly changing the\n\nwave-breaking parameters or the model resolution allowed the extension of the model\n\napplication to greater wave heights but, for a question of consistency, runs with different\n\nmodel parameters are not considered for comparison.\n\nInfluence of offshore peak period, Tp\n\nLike varying the offshore wave height, keeping the offshore wave peak period constant\n\nchanges wave steepness, the inverse is also valid: for the same wave height, if the\n\nperiod is increased, wave steepness decreases. Fig. 3.32 shows that ss the offshore\n\npeak period increases, both the wave skewness and asymmetry start developing earlier\n\nin the shoaling zone, increasing until their maxima are reached. Bmax can increase\n\nup to about 22% when the peak period is doubled. For the greater-Tp runs, Hrms\n\nincreases before wave breaking, reflecting the need for a greater wave height to develop\n\n(and greater wave steepness) to allow wave-breaking initiation.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3\n\nconditions with longer offshore peak period are shown to have higher IG-wave energy\n\nat the wave-maker and in the shoaling zone. However, this is simply a direct result of\n\nthe fact that the wave conditions with longer peak periods were designed with greater\n\nenergy at the peak frequency (because the spectral range of frequencies considered was\n\nsmaller than for shorter peak periods), which implies higher IG-wave energy as well.\n\nInfluence of bandwidth, ?\n\nA JONSWAP spectrum of irregular-wave conditions can have different bandwidths,\n\nfrom broad- to narrow-banded, which essentially determines the main range of frequen-\n\ncies that will interact along the beach profile, increasing wave nonlinearity and feeding\n\nhigher and lower frequencies than the peak frequency. Fig. 3.33 shows how changing\n\nthe bandwidth of the JONSWAP spectrum may influence the presence of IG waves and\n\nnonlinearity.

Note: the purple curves correspond to A3T run.\n\nInfluence of beach slope, tan(?)\n\nThe beach slope has long been recognized to influence wave propagation. It conditions\n\nthe evolution of wave nonlinearity, the type of breaking and the reflection of IG waves.\n\nHere, the bed slope was changed from 1/20 to 1/300 to analyse its influence on the\n\ncontrol variables. Fig. 3.34 shows how changing the bed slope, from very steep to very\n\n75\n\n\n\nSection 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\ngentle, influences wave propagation. Unlike for the previous cases, here the cross-shore\n\ndirection is considered in terms of water depth (h), instead of cross-shore distance (x),\n\nwhich allows an easier comparison of the wave propagation over the different beach\n\nslopes considered. In the case of steeper beaches, a sudden increase of wave height\n\nclose to the coast can be observed, which allows wave breaking to occur. The IG\n\nwaves increase their height towards the shore and only in the case of very gentle slopes\n\n(tan(?) > 80) does their height decrease before reaching the shoreline. There is an\n\nincrease of 58% of the Bmax when the beach slope is diminished from 1/20 to 1/300.\n\nThis increase is more significant for very-gentle slopes (gentler than 1/80), for which the\n\nnonlinearities have more time to develop before reaching the coast. The fundamental\n\ndifference can be seen in the maximum value of Sk?, which can increase by 122% when\n\nthe beach slope changes from very steep to very gentle, or by 43% when the beach\n\nslope is diminished only until 1/80. For steeper slopes, asymmetry starts increasing at\n\na greater water depth than for gentler slopes.\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\nH\nr\nm\n\ns\n,\nto\n\nta\nl\na\nn\nd\n\nI\nG\n(m\n\n)\n\n00.20.40.60.8\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nA\ns\n?\n,\nS\nk\n?\n\nh (m)\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\ntan(?)?1\n\nB\nm\n\na\nx\n\n \n\n \n\n10\n-2\n\n10\n-1\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n-6\n\n10\n-4\n\n10\n-2\n\nP\nS\nD\n\n?\n(m\n\n2\nH\nz-\n\n1\n)\n\nf (Hz)\n\nTp\n\n20\n\n35\n\n45\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nFigure 3.34: Influence of tan(?) on Hrms (solid line - total; dashed line - IG waves only), Sk?

The last plot shows the spectra of free-surface elevation the\nfirst wave gauge.\n\nInfluence of modulation\n\nChanging the modulation of bichromatic wave groups is a direct way of analyzing\n\nthe effect of varying IG-wave height. Therefore, various bichromatic wave conditions\n\nwith different modulation were simulated, in order to investigate the effect on wave\n\npropagation and nonlinearities. This was done by varying the amplitude of the main\n\n76\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3\n\nfrequency components (a1 and a2) of the bichromatic wave groups. The closer the\n\nvalues of a1 and a2, the greatest the modulation and thus the IG-wave height. The\n\ninfluence of the modulation on wave propagation is not analysed in terms of Bmax values\n\nand hence Fig. 3.35 is slightly different from the figures presented for the previous\n\nparameters evaluated. Since the focus is not on the maximum nonlinearity value, but\n\non the multiple existent maxima, instead of representing Bmax, the evolution of B\n\nalong the beach profile is shown. The spectra are zoomed on the main frequency peaks,\n\nhighlighting the amplitude differences of the main components between wave conditions.\n\nInitially, the first six conditions (from blue to purple) are analysed. Among these, the\n\nwave conditions with less modulation have significantly-smaller IG-wave height (blue\n\nand green), even though total wave height is greater in the shoaling zone, due to the\n\ngreater short-wave energy resulting from the values of a1 and a2. They reach, locally,\n\ngreater values of nonlinearity, but the maxima are not located at the same cross-shore\n\npositions as they are for the wave conditions with greater modulation.\n\nFrom the analysis of GLOBEX B conditions, it was pointed out that the multiple\n\npeaks of skewness could be attributed to both the existence of two breaker zones and\n\nthe influence of IG waves on short-wave nonlinearities. Among these, the first and\n\nthe second peaks can be accurately represented by the model, in terms of cross-shore\n\nposition (and, for the first, also in terms of amplitude). Fig. 3.35 shows that, when\n\nwave breaking happens over a narrow surf zone, it has a local skewness and nonlinearity\n\npeak associated (just before x = 60 m).

Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nheight and weaker modulation. The position and value of the other peaks, however, vary\n\nsignificantly as a function of the modulation. The blue lines of Fig. 3.35 plots represent\n\nthe wave condition with less modulation and greater short-wave energy. Contrary to the\n\nother conditions, it has no skewness peak corresponding to the IG-wave trough located\n\nbetween x = 65 m and x = 75 m and the greatest B and Sk values are reached in the\n\nbeginning of the swash zone. The green curves, corresponding to a wave condition with\n\nslightly more modulation than the blue ones, show a decrease of the swash-zone peak\n\nand the appearance of a peak at the IG-wave trough just after x=65 m. For the other\n\nwave conditions with increasing modulation (red, cyan, violet) this skewness peak at\n\nthe IG-wave trough position is greater and more marked. The maximum B values occur\n\nin the beginning of the swash zone, for conditions with less modulation, and closer to\n\nthe shoreline, when the modulation is greater. The first asymmetry maximum is greater\n\nwhen modulation is weaker, and the second one when the modulation is stronger.\n\nThe influence of the modulation, when the short-wave height is kept the same, can be\n\nseen in the difference between the condition with a1 = 0.09 m and a2 = 0.01 m (blue),\n\nwhich has the smallest modulation of all the bichromatic conditions presented, and the\n\ncondition with a1 = 0.064 m and a2 = 0.064 m (yellow), which has the same energy, but\n\nthe greatest modulation possible. The higher modulation implies a larger variability of\n\nthe short-wave height, and thus a greater similitude with the irregular-wave conditions.\n\nHence, the breaking happens more gradually over a wider region of the domain, with\n\nthe higher waves breaking sooner than the smaller ones. The IG-waves height does\n\nnot follow an oscillating trend and the trends of Sk, As and B are smoother and with\n\nsmaller and less marked peaks, like it was observed for irregular-wave conditions. The\n\ntendency for wave conditions with weaker modulation to have greater absolute values\n\nof skewness and asymmetry maxima and greater B values is again confirmed when\n\nconditions with the same short-wave energy but distinct modulations are considered\n\n(the blue and yellow curves).\n\nOverall, it is shown that the IG waves do influence the nonlinearities depending\n\non the modulation, but also depending on the ratio between the short-wave and the\n\nIG-wave energy.\n\n3.3.5 Discussion\n\nThe bichromatic-wave runs with different modulation have highlighted the influence\n\nof IG waves on the short-wave nonlinearities. For the same short-wave height, larger\n\nmodulation (and thus higher IG waves) results in smaller nonlinearity maxima. This is in\n\nagreement with Elgar &amp; Guza (1985), who found interactions involving low frequencies\n\nto tend to reduce free-surface elevation skewness and asymmetry. It is also shown that\n\n78\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3\n\nincreasing modulation of bichromatic-wave conditions results in a greater similitude\n\nwith the irregular-wave conditions, due to the greater variability of the short-wave\n\nheight: broader surf zone and less-marked local maxima of nonlinearity in the surf zone.\n\nThe irregular-wave runs have proven that the evolution and maxima of wave nonlin-\n\nearity depend on several non-local parameters, such as the offshore wave height, period\n\nand spectral bandwidth and the beach slope.\n\nDibajnia et al. (2001) have argued that waves with small offshore wave steepness\n\nbecome more nonlinear during the shoaling process than those with great offshore\n\nwave steepness, which eventually break in deeper waters before undergoing significant\n\nshoaling. Hence, they have used in their parameterization of nonlinearities the offshore\n\nwave steepness to define the value of the nonlinearity maximum that can be reached\n\nalong the beach profile for a give wave condition. This is in conformity with the results\n\npresented, in which smaller offshore Hm0 (for the same offshore Tp) and greater offshore\n\nTp (for the same offshore Hm0), and thus smaller offshore wave steepness (H0/L0)\n\nresulted in a greater maximum value of the nonlinearity parameter (Bmax).\n\nElgar &amp; Guza (1985) have compared broad- and narrow-banded data sets and found\n\nthat the interactions between frequency pairs are spread over a wide range of frequencies\n\nfor a broad-band data set, and happen between relatively few triads (the spectral peak\n\nand its harmonics) for a narrow-band case. These authors argued that skewness and\n\nasymmetry for both cases are quite similar, but their results show a maximum skewness\n\nvalue for the narrow-band case about at least 30 % larger than that found for the\n\nbroad-band case. Norheim et al. (1998) have found the spectral evolution to be much\n\nweaker for wave conditions with broad-banded spectra, because the principal effect\n\nof the triad interactions (interactions that involve two different frequencies and their\n\nsum frequency) in this case is to spread energy to frequencies where spectral levels are\n\nrelatively low. For the narrow-banded spectra, thee authors observed harmonic peaks to\n\ndevelop more significantly. The increasing value of the nonlinearity parameter (Bmax)\n\nin response to the narrowing of the offshore wave spectrum presented in the previous\n\nsubsection thus corroborates the findings of those authors.\n\nThe results of the model simulations have also demonstrated that decreasing beach\n\nsteepness results in a greater development of the nonlinearities, particularly due to the\n\ncontribution of skewness. This is in agreement with Norheim et al. (1998), who found\n\ngentler slopes to promote a stronger growth of the harmonic and infragravity peaks,\n\nwith a more important contribution from the real part of the bispectrum (skewness). For\n\nsteeper slopes, they found cumulative energy transfers to be smaller and the imaginary\n\npart of the bispectrum (asymmetry) to be greater. For the steepest slopes simulated in\n\nthis work (1/35 and 1/20), asymmetry has indeed a greater contribution to the total\n\n79\n\n\n\nSection 3.4 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nnonlinearity, but this is due to the relatively smaller contribution of the skewness to\n\nthe total, since the asymmetry increase (from gentle to steep slopes) is not significant.\n\nMore recently, Filipot (2015) has also argued the dependence of wave nonlinearity (in\n\nparticular, of wave skewness) on the beach slope. The author has established that\n\nwave skewness at the breakpoint is a decreasing function of the bottom slope and thus\n\nbottom slope may partially control breaking initiation.\n\nIt is then clear that wave nonlinearities may depend on more than local wave para-\n\nmeters. Rocha et al. (2013b) (presented in next subsection) have analyzed and applied\n\nto field data existing parameterizations and concluded that offshore wave parameters\n\nand the beach slope, which can be seen as the history of the waves, could bring an\n\nimprovement to the present estimations of velocity skewness and asymmetry, which is\n\nthe aim of the following section.\n\n3.4 Parameterization of velocity nonlinearities\n\n3.4.1 Field data - Parameterizations of wave nonlinearity from\n\nlocal wave parameters\n\nThe article below was presented in Plymouth, at the International Coastal Symposium,\n\nin 2013.

It is thus of paramount importance to \n\naccurately describe these nonlinear effects in order to better \n\nunderstand the cross-shore sediment transport and improve current \n\nbeach profile morphodynamic models. \n\nHighly-advanced phase-resolving wave models, such as those \n\nbased on the Boussinesq or the RANS equations, are able of \n\naccurately describing the transformation of each individual wave \n\nas it approaches the shore. However, these models are still too \n\ncomputationally demanding for application to morphodynamics \n\nsettings and thus, for practical engineering purposes, simple \n\nanalytical theories (linear and nonlinear) are often employed. \n\nThe free-stream velocity, driven by the time-varying \n\nfree-surface, represents the velocity immediately outside the wave \n\nbottom boundary layer and its skewness and asymmetry changes \n\nreflect the changing wave shape at the surface. Both skewness and \n\nasymmetry can be evaluated using different parameters suggested \n\nby several authors (e.g. Drake and Cantaloni, 2001; Elfrink et al., \n\n2006; Ruessink et al., 2009; Abreu et al., 2010). \n\nAlthough a wide set of different formulations has been \n\ndeveloped for deriving free-stream wave orbital velocity from \n\nnonlinearity parameters (e.g. Isobe and Horikawa, 1982; Drake \n\nand Calantoni, 2001, Abreu et al., 2010), it can also be of great \n\nuse, both for field-work purposes and numerical modeling, \n\ndefining velocity skewness and asymmetry (and thus, the \n\ndescription of the wave shape) at a certain depth directly from \n\nlocal wave parameters, such as  wave height and period and water \n\ndepth (Ursell number). \n\nTherefore, this work aims to compare three different recent \n\nparameterizations (Dibajnia et al., 2001 (DMW01, for simplicity); \n\nElfrink et al., 2006 (EHR06); Ruessink et al., 2012 (RRR12)) with \n\nfield data acquired in several sites under various wave energy \n\nconditions, in order to evaluate the applicability of each \n\nparameterization to other data than those considered in its \n\nformulation, to better insure the possibility of a wider use of these \n\nwave skewness and asymmetry parameterizations from local wave \n\nparameters. \n\nPARAMETERIZATIONS \nThe three formulations considered in this work have in common \n\nthe fact that some measure of wave nonlinearity is described by \n\nmeans of local wave parameters, for breaking and non-breaking \n\nwaves, and constant sloping beds. In all cases, the free-stream \n\nvelocity time series are calculated near the bottom, but outside the \n\nbottom boundary layer, and from those, the nonlinearity \n\nparameters considered for each formulation are computed.  \n\nDibajnia et al. (2001) parameterization \nThis parameterization was developed for irregular waves, \n\nbased on a set of wave flume experiments. Nevertheless, its \n\nadjustment to field data will be studied in this work and compared \n\nwith other field-based formulations. \n\n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n \n\n \n\nRocha, M.V.L., Silva, P.A., Michallet, H., Abreu, T., Moura, D., Fortes, C.J., 2013.

The hydrodynamics of the various sites are analyzed, together with the performance of each formulation. \n\nThe data considered extend the range of the data previously used by the authors of the parameterizations, including \n\nlonger wave lengths and higher Ursell numbers. A comparison is done, based on skill and agreement index values, to \n\nunderstand the performance and applicability of each parameterization and what could be changed to improve such \n\nformulations. \n\nADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS:  Velocity skewness, velocity asymmetry, Ursell number, Iribarren number. \n\nwww.JCRonline.org \n\nwww.cerf-jcr.org \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 65, 2013 \n\nParameterizations of wave nonlinearity from local wave parameters: a comparison with field data \n\nDibajnia et al. (2001) define two parameters: the nonlinearity \n\nparameter,  \n\n    (\n    \n\n ?\n)\n   \n\n  (1) \n\nwhere      is the velocity at the wave crest and  ? is the velocity \namplitude (from crest to trough), and the asymmetry parameter, \n\n    (\n    \n\n \n)\n   \n\n  (2) \n\nwith     defined as the time interval between the velocity zero \n\nup-crossing before the crest and the wave-crest maximum, and   \nthe wave period. For a purely-sinusoidal wave shape, these \n\nparameters have a value of 0.5, increasing or decreasing for \n\ngreater nonlinearity or asymmetry, respectively. These can be \n\ndefined for each Ursell number, here described as \n\n   \n         \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n        \n \n\n  \n   (3) \n\nassuming shallow water approximation (  ?  ), where     , \n\n     and      are the significant wave height, period and length,   \n\nthe local water depth and   the acceleration of gravity.  \nThe shapes of the parameterization curves include a \n\nmaximum, for nonlinearity, and a minimum, for asymmetry. The \n\nestimation of the position of these peaks depends on offshore \n\nwave steepness (  /  ). Hence, this formulation is expected to be \nsensitive to the definition of offshore wave conditions, which are \n\nobtained from the available wave buoys (for field data), often \n\nlocated at a significant distance from each field site. The \n\ndependence of Nlp and Asp peaks on deep water wave steepness \n\nhas already been analyzed by Dibajnia et al. (2001) \n\nThe sensitivity to offshore wave conditions can be a positive \n\npoint for this formulation, as wave history is accounted for, and \n\nmay lead to a better description of local wave conditions. \n\nWhen applying this formulation, it should be taken into \n\naccount that it was developed based on experimental data \n\ncollected in a wave flume with uniform bottom slope and that the \n\nlocal values of the Nlp and Asp were obtained using the results of \n\nwave height transformation calculated by an energy conservation \n\nmethod. \n\nElfrink et al. (2006) parameterization \nThis formulation also considers a wave-by-wave analysis to \n\ndefine nonlinearity parameters from local wave characteristics. \n\nHowever, instead of directly calculating skewness and asymmetry \n\nparameters, these authors derived synthetic orbital-velocity time \n\nseries, using a set of simple sinusoidal functions for defining the \n\nshape of each segment between the maximum and minimum \n\nvelocities and the zero-crossings. The nonlinearity of each \n\nindividual wave is determined from local parameters, such as \n\nnormalized wave height (      ), where   is the height of an \nindividual wave and   is the local water depth) and length \n(      , with   the wave length calculated according to Airy \nwave theory, from the period T of each individual wave) and the \n\nIribarren number, defined as \n\n   \n    \n\n?(\n \n\n  \n)\n    (4) \n\nwhere   is the local bed slope and    the offshore wave length. \nSkewness and asymmetry can then be calculated from the \n\nsynthetic orbital-velocity time series and analyzed in function of \n\nthe Ursell number, here defined as: \n\n              (5) \nSkewness (  ) and asymmetry (  ) calculated for this \n\nparameterization and also for the next one, proposed by Ruessink \n\net al. (2012), are calculated from the third-order moments defined \n\nin (6) and (7). \n\n   \n  \n\n    ?? ?? ?? ??\n\n   \n     (6) \n\n   \n        \n\n ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?\n\n   \n     (7) \n\nwhere the over bar represents a time average,       is the total \nsea-swell orbital velocity in the direction of wave advance,    is \n\nthe standard deviation of       and           the imaginary part \nof  the Hilbert transform of      . \n\nFor a purely-sinusoidal shape, both parameters have a 0 value, \n\nwhich becomes progressively more positive or negative, for larger \n\nskewness or asymmetry, respectively. \n\nRuessink et al. (2012) parameterization \nMost recently, a new methodology to compute nonlinearity \n\nparameters representative of a series of random, natural waves \n\nfrom local wave parameters was suggested by Ruessink et al. \n\n(2012). These authors argue that even though individual waves \n\nmay be rather accurately described by parameterizations based on \n\na wave-by-wave analysis, error accumulation makes the use of a \n\nseries of individual waves to estimate time-averaged measures of \n\nwave nonlinearity questionable. Thus, based on statistical and \n\nspectral parameters, the authors compute the dependence of    \nand    on the Ursell number, defined here as \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n     \n \n\n \n\n    \n   \n\n \n\n  \n     \n\n   \n \n\n  \n    (8) \n\nwhere           (   being the significant wave height),   and  \n  are, respectively, the local wave number and corresponding \n\nwave length computed with linear wave theory using   (  \n  \n\n  \n, \n\nwhere    is the spectral moment of order  ). If the significant \nwave length is considered, then the Ur defined in equation (8) is \n\nabout 0.01 times the Ur described in equation (3). \n\nThe authors of this parameterization also stress the fact that it  \n\nis based predominantly on directionally-spread sea conditions and \n\nwill tend to underestimate the skewness of orbital velocity in \n\nnarrow-banded swell and unidirectional laboratory waves and that \n\nthe data used in the development of these formulations were \n\ncollected in low sloping (&lt;1/30) wide sandy beaches. \n\n \n\nIt should be further noted that, although in this paper the wave \n\nnonlinearities are always referred to as skewness and asymmetry, \n\nthis is only literally true for EHR06 and RRR12 \n\nparameterizations, in which these parameters are calculated from \n\nthe third-order moments of orbital velocity. For DMW01 case, the \n\nparameters considered are instead a nonlinearity parameter, as an \n\nequivalent for skewness and an asymmetry parameter, for \n\nasymmetry. These depend on the values and time instants (along \n\nthe wave period) of velocity maxima, minima and zero-crossing \n\nvalues.  \n\nAlso, a good agreement is not expected when the results are \n\nextrapolated beyond the range of the empirical data in which the \n\nformulations are based. \n\nFIELD DATA \nThe data used in this work were collected at four different field \n\nsites in Portugal: Mira and Ofir beaches, on the northwest coast, \n\nCosta da Caparica (CC) beach, on the west coast, near Lisbon, and \n\nGal\u00e9 beach, on the southern coast (Figure 1). During each tidal \n\ncycle, in every field site, one or more pairs of a pressure \n\ntransducer (PT) and a collocated electromagnetic current meter \n\n(ECM) were placed at different points along the beach profile, to \n\nmeasure free-surface elevation and horizontal velocity, \n\nrespectively, outside the bottom boundary layer. Table 1 offers a \n\nbrief description of the offshore wave conditions and beach \n\n\n\n \n\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 65, 2013 \n\nParameterizations of wave nonlinearity from local wave parameters: a comparison with field data \n\ncharacteristics of each field site. The rocky bottom of Gal\u00e9 beach \ncorresponds to a 50 m-wide shore platform with constant \n\nsteepness, extending from the cliff foot and adjacent to the sandy \n\nbeach profile. Gal\u00e9 1 and 2 data sets were collected in the \n\nbeginning of the seaward-end of the platform and Gal\u00e9 3 and 4 \n\nnear the cliff. \n\nFigure 2 depicts the field data coverage in terms of wave \n\nheight over water depth (H/h) and wavelength over water depth \n\n(L/h) and Figure 3 also shows the data coverage, but considering \n\nIribarren (Ib) and Ursell (Ur) numbers. \n\nMost data were collected in the inner surf zone, encompassing \n\nall types of breakers, with a greatest occurrence of spilling \n\n(Ib ? 0.4) and plunging (0.4 &lt;Ib ? 2.5) breakers, for all data sets, \n\nand some collapsing (2.5 &lt;Ib ? 3) and surging breakers (Ib > 3), \n\nfor Mira field site. The data span a wide range of wave heights and \n\nlengths and different beach slopes and types of bed are considered. \n\nRelatively to the data used by the authors of DMW01, EHR06 and \n\nRRR12 parameterizations, the data sets considered herein present \n\ngreater wavelengths and larger Ursell numbers. \n\nMETHODS \nIn order to evaluate which of the three chosen \n\nparameterizations performs better for the field data collected, local \n\nwave parameters were obtained from free-surface elevation time \n\nseries and applied to calculate free-stream wave orbital velocity \n\nskewness and asymmetry, according to each chosen \n\nparameterization. These nonlinearity values were then compared \n\nwith the values calculated directly from the free-stream wave \n\norbital velocity measured with the collocated current meters. \n\nThe PT and ECM data corresponding to periods of emersion \n\nof the instruments were removed, implying that the analysis \n\nperformed did not include any data from the swash zone. All free-\n\nsurface elevation time series were then divided into 15-min \n\nintervals and filtered, so that only sea-swell waves were \n\nconsidered (frequency range 0.05-0.33 Hz), following the work of \n\nRuessink et al. (2012).  Also for the velocity time-series 15-min \n\nintervals were considered, and low- and high-frequency \n\ncomponents (f &lt;0.05 Hz and f > 1 Hz) were filtered out. All \n\ngathered records of cross-shore and longshore orbital velocities \n\nwere combined into time series of total sea-swell orbital velocity \n\nin the direction of wave advance, using eigenfunction analysis, for \n\nwhich the required nonlinearity parameters were then computed. \n\nFurther, it is important to stress that for the various field sites, a \n\ndifferent number of 15-min intervals was considered depending on \n\nthe length of the time series available. \n\nFor both DMW01 and EHR06 methods a wave-by-wave \n\nanalysis was necessary for calculating the Ursell number, and in \n\nthe case of DMW01, also for calculating nonlinearity and \n\nasymmetry parameters. Hence, it was necessary to identify each \n\nindividual wave present in the complete free-surface \nelevation/velocity time series. For that, a zero-crossing method \n\nwas used, implying a need for defining a threshold value for the \n\nsmallest height that an individual wave must possess to be \n\nconsidered a single wave (this threshold is defined as a certain \n\npercentage of the maximum wave height of the time series).

Also EHR06 parameterization depends on offshore \n\nconditions, although indirectly, through the Iribarren number. In \n\nthe laboratory, these conditions are easy to define, since the input \n\nconditions for the wave maker are known. However, in the field, it \n\nbecomes substantially more difficult to have good-quality wave \n\ndata offshore. In the case of the considered field campaigns, these \n\ndata were gathered from low-resolution wave buoy measurements, \n\nfrom the closest-available wave buoy for each field site. Hence, \n\nthe inaccuracy of deep-water conditions used in the \n\nparameterizations must also be taken into account. \n\nFor evaluating the capability of each formulation to fit field \n\ndata, two different parameters were considered. The skill \n\ncoefficient, which represents, for each field data point, a scaled \n\nmeasure of its deviation from the parameterization, can be \n\nformulated as: \n\n        ?\n?        \n\n  \n   \n\n?     \n  \n\n   \n\n    (9) \n\nwhere    are the field data values,    the values calculated with the \nparameterizations and   is the number of values considered. \nNegative skill values can occur if           , corresponding to \na very poor performance of the parameterization. A perfect \n\nperformance will reach a skill score of 1.  \n\nThe other parameter considered, the agreement index, has the \n\nadvantage of depicting if the general trend of the field data follows \n\neach parameterization, instead of just evaluating the proximity \n\nbetween numerical and field values at each point, and will thus be \n\nof great importance for choosing the best formulation. It can be \n\ncalculated as: \n\n     \n?        \n\n  \n   \n\n?  |    ?| |    ?| \n  \n\n   \n\n   (10) \n\nwhere  ? represents the mean value of the   field data values \nconsidered. This index can only have values from 0 (poor \n\nperformance) to 1 (perfect performance). \n\nPARAMETERIZATIONS AND FIELD DATA \nIn this section, the results obtained with the three different \n\nparameterizations are compared with the field data obtained in the \n\nvarious field sites. \n\nDibajnia et al. (2001) parameterization \nFigure 4 shows the different curves obtained with DMW01 \n\nparameterization for each field site (characterized by different \n\noffshore wave steepness) and the distribution of field-data values. \n\nIn general, the magnitude of the values is fairly well \n\ndescribed, which is corroborated by skill values over 0.95, for Nlp \n\nand 0.7, for Asp (see Figure 8). The cloud of points approximately \n\nfollows the parameterization curve, although a shift towards \n\nhigher Ursell numbers is notorious. This results in fairly good \n\nagreement indexes for some particular cases, but an average AI \n\naround 0.4, for Nlp, and lower, for Asp. CC and Ofir field sites \n\npresent the best fits, with fairly high AI for Nlp. \n\nThis parameterization was developed based on wave flume \n\nexperimental data. For this type of data, the mean period, Tz, \n\ncalculated from the spectral moments m1 and m0, can be \n\nconsidered equivalent to the significant wave period, T1/3 or Ts, as \n\nthe wave spectrum is narrow banded. However, when field data \n\nare considered, the wave spectrum cannot always be considered \n\nnarrow banded. Therefore, the equivalence Tz = T1/3 does not \n\nnecessarily hold, and Tz tends to be smaller than T1/3. Hence, the \n\nUrsell numbers calculated for this parameterization for the data \n\nsets considered herein are overestimated (as a higher T implies a \n\nhigher Ur), which explains the shift of field-data values to the \n\nright side of the theoretical curves of the parameterization. Figure \n\n5 shows the results obtained with this parameterization when Tz is \n\nconsidered instead of Ts (calculated with the zero-crossing \n\nmethod), and it can be clearly seen that the shift to higher Ur \n\npresent in Figure 4 is corrected. This is corroborated by an \n\nincrease of skill, particularly for asymmetry, for which the scores \n\nrise for values above 0.9 for most data sets (not shown). The AI \n\nvalues also increase, both for the nonlinearity and the asymmetry \n\nparameters, which reach values of almost 0.9. \n\nElfrink et al.

Thus, skewness (eq. 6) and asymmetry \n\n(eq. 7) were calculated both for the measured and the synthetic \n\ntime series and directly compared, independently of the Ursell \n\nnumber, although the parameters employed for the evaluation of \n\nits performance are, for a question of consistency, the same as for \n\nthe other parameterizations. \n\nThere is clearly a great scatter both for skewness and \n\nasymmetry: the field values are mostly under- and overestimated, \n\nrespectively, except for the values corresponding to the second \n\ntidal cycle in Gal\u00e9 beach and to Mira beach, where asymmetry is \n\nmostly underestimated. Particularly for skewness, most skill \n\nscores are rather low, between less than 0.2 to less than 0.5, and \n\nthe AI is never higher than 0.5 (see Figure 8). Also, synthetic \n\nskewness calculated for Mira data set has negative values, while \n\nmeasured skewness presents only positive values, and hence the \n\nperformance of EHR06 parameterization is particularly poor for \n\nthis field site, which results in a negative value of the skill score, \n\nsignificantly lower than the other values. For asymmetry, the \n\nperformance of this formulation is better, although skill values can \n\nvary substantially depending on the data set. \n\nRuessink et al. (2001) parameterization \nObserving Figure 7 it is clear that data still present a \n\nconsiderable scatter relatively to this parameterization, particularly \n\nfor Mira and Gal\u00e9 sites. However, for the other field sites, the \n\ngeneral trends of skewness and asymmetry dependency on the \n\nUrsell number are significantly well described, as it is depicted by \n\nthe high agreement indexes, particularly for asymmetry (almost \n\nreaching 0.9), that are above the ones calculated for the other \n\nparameterizations (see Figure 8). Especially if only data from \n\nCosta da Caparica and Ofir beach sites are looked at, asymmetry \n\nskill scores calculated are high, above 0.75. Nevertheless, there is \n\nstill a considerable spread for both skewness and asymmetry \n\nagreement-index values from very low values to high values, \n\ndepending on the data set considered. \nStill, it should be noted that, except for the data corresponding \n\nto the second tidal cycle in Gal\u00e9 beach, the scatter observed both \n\nfor skewness and asymmetry is very similar to the scatter obtained \n\nby Ruessink et al. (2012) for their own data. This parameterization \n\nperforms notoriously worst for Mira and Gal\u00e9 field sites. \n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \nEHR06 parameterization generally presents the worst \n\nperformance for the field data considered in this work. Not having \n\nbeen directly developed for parameterizing skewness and \n\nasymmetry, but instead for creating synthetic velocity time series, \n\nit is clear that wave velocity nonlinearities are not easily well \n\nreproduced with this formula. Also, the offshore wave period was \n\nfound to have a significant influence on synthetic skewness and \n\nasymmetry and this is a variable for which it is hard to get \n\nhigh-quality data. Further, this parameterization fails completely \n\nto predict skewness for Mira field site, when local H/h and L/h are \n\nsubstantially outside the range of values used to develop the \n\nformulation (higher and longer waves) and the Iribarren number is \n\nhigher (steeper beach slope), corresponding to plunging, \n\ncollapsing and surging breaker types. Also, a long set of equations \n\nis needed to define the shape of each individual wave, which \n\nmakes the application of this formulation rather cumbersome. It \n\nshall be of greater interest in the case of the specific shape of each \n\nwave being important, rather than when statistical parameters \n\n(such as skewness and asymmetry) are calculated for a set of \n\nwaves, as it is done herein. \n\nDMW01 parameterization describes quite well Nlp and Asp \n\nmagnitudes. Skill scores for this parameterization are very similar \n\nfor all field campaigns, unlike what is found for the other \n\nformulations, particularly RRR12, for which the measurements of \n\n \nFigure 6.

The shift of data points to higher \n\nUrsell numbers than predicted by the theoretical curves can be \n\nattenuated by calculating Ur from Tz (like it is done for RRR12 \n\nformulation) instead of from Ts. The fact that this \n\nparameterization, even having been developed based on wave \n\nflume experimental data, is able of reproducing well all the field \n\ndata sets (particularly if Tz is considered), may point out the \n\nimportance of considering offshore wave conditions for \n\nencompassing a greater range of wave conditions and beaches. \n\nRegarding RRR12 parameterization, Ofir and Costa da \n\nCaparica data sets seem to fit really well to the theoretical curves \n\nand even the variation of skewness and asymmetry in function of \n\nthe Ur number is well represented, not only their magnitudes. This \n\nis corroborated by the higher agreement index values calculated \n\nfor almost all data sets and constitutes the greatest achievement of \n\nthis formulation when compared to the others (if DMW01 is not \n\napplied considering Tz).  \n\nHowever, for Gal\u00e9 and Mira beaches, a greater scatter can be \n\nobserved for skewness and a strong underestimation of asymmetry \n\nis also clear. This possibly denounces an important handicap of \n\nparameterizations based on few and local-only wave parameters: \n\nthese can perform very well when applied to beaches very similar \n\nto the ones used for developing the formulations, but fail to predict \n\nskewness and asymmetry for field sites with different \n\ncharacteristics. This explains why Ofir and Costa da Caparica field \n\nsites, being the only sandy beaches considered with slopes inferior \n\nto 1/30, fit nicely to that parameterization, which was developed \n\nbased on data collected in such type of beaches. Nevertheless, this \n\nformulation seems to be more robust for inner surf zone and/or \n\nstrong plunging breakers. \n\nThe data sets deviating the most from RRR12 \n\nparameterization seem to show one of two or both characteristics: \n\neither these measurements present higher values of L/h and H/h \n\nthan the rest, or higher Ib values. The Mira data set, which never \n\nreally fits any parameterization, possesses both characteristics, \n\nwith a particularly high ratio of H and h and the highest Ib \n\nmeasured. The first may be due to bed erosion/accretion along the \n\ntidal cycle that could result in a higher water depth during high \n\ntide than the measured during the previous and the following low \n\ntides, which would have reduced H/h during that period to more \n\ncommon values. However, this cannot be confirmed with the data \n\navailable. The second is associated with both a steeper beach slope \n\nand longer wave periods (   ?  ). Also, the combined effect of \nboth larger wave heights and shorter wave periods leads to large \n\nIb values, associated with very asymmetric waves, as it can be \n\nseen for the second-tidal-cycle data of Gal\u00e9 beach, which deviate \n\nfurther from the parameterization than the rest. \n\nGal\u00e9 data sets do not have a very high Ib, but have instead \n\nsignificantly-large wave lengths for the small wave heights and \n\nwater depths measured. Since this particular beach has a complex \n\nmorphology with shore platforms, the cliff, a mixture of sandy and \n\nrocky beds, inducing wave refraction and reflection along the \n\nshoaling and breaking zones, it is not possible with the data \n\navailable to explain the exact origin of the measured wave \n\nconditions, but only to analyze their characteristics. \n\n \n\nOverall, it is clear that, although RRR12 parameterization can \n\nsimulate very accurately the dependence of skewness and \n\nasymmetry on the Ursell number for a specific set of wave \n\nconditions and low-sloping sandy beaches, it cannot be used to \n\nparameterize nonlinearities from local wave parameters for other \n\ntypes of beaches.  \n\nThe characteristics of the data sets that deviate the most from \n\nthe theoretical curves and the fact that DMW01 parameterization \n\nis fairly capable of reproducing the magnitude of nonlinearity and \n\nasymmetry parameters (even though it was developed from \n\nlaboratory data sets and is unable of reproducing so well the \n\ngeneral trend of the data), lead to the conclusion that both beach \n\nslope and offshore wave conditions should be incorporated in any \n\nparameterization aiming to define skewness and asymmetry in the \n\nnearshore for a wide range of beach types and wave conditions. \n\nFurther developments of this work should include the search \n\nof such parameterization, starting by the quantification of the \n\nrelative importance of the different offshore wave parameters and \n\nthe beach slope on the variation of skewness and asymmetry in the \n\nnearshore. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work was supported by the FCT (Portuguese Science and \n\nTechnology Foundation), through the PhD grant \n\nSFRH/BD/80644/2011, by the FCT and European Union \n\n(COMPETE, QREN, FEDER) in the scope of the research \n\nprojects BRISA (PTDC/ECM/67411/2006) and EROS \n\n(PTDC/CTE-GIX/111230/2009) and by INSU/LEFE in the \n\nframework of BARCAN project.  \n\nThe authors would also like to acknowledge the collaboration \n\nof the numerous people involved in the field campaigns, in \n\nparticular Francisco Sancho, Joaquim Barbosa, Paulo Batista, \n\nSelma Gabriel and Daniela Santos. \n\nLITERATURE CITED \nAbreu, T., Silva, P.A., Sancho, F. and Temperville, A., 2010. \n\nAnalytical approximate wave form for asymmetric waves. \n\nCoastal Engineering, 57, 656-667.  \n\nAbreu, T., Michallet, H., Silva, P.A., Sancho, F., van der A, D.A. \n\nand Ruessink, B.G., 2013.

Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.4\n\n3.4.2 The RRR12 parameterization\n\nRuessink et al. (2012) recently proposed a parameterization (RRR12) that constitutes\n\nan extension of previous work done by Doering &amp; Bowen (1995) and Kuriyama (2009)\n\nand defines, for irregular waves, the dependency of velocity nonlinearity on local wave\n\nheight and period and water depth (the Ursell number, eq. 3.25). This parameterization\n\nhas been shown to perform better than other existing parameterizations within a certain\n\nrange of wave conditions and beach slopes (discussed in the previous subsection, Rocha\n\net al., 2013b). However, since it is based only on the Ur number, it still presents some\n\nlimitations when the wave conditions or beach slopes are beyond range of those in which\n\nit was based. This section is hence dedicated to the improving of this parameterization\n\nby the inclusion of non-local wave parameters.\n\nIn RRR12 parameteriztion, B (eq. 3.24) and ? (? = tan?1\n(\nAsu\nSku\n\n)\n) nonlinearity\n\nparameters are parameterized as\n\nB = p1 +\np2 ?p1\n\n1 + exp(\np3?log(Ur)\n\np4\n)\n\n(3.27)\n\nand\n\n? = ?90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 tanh(p5/Urp6 ), (3.28)\n\nwith p1 = 0, p2 = 0.857 \u00b1 0.016, p3 = ?0.417 \u00b1 0.025, p4 = 0.297 \u00b1 0.021, p5 =\n0.815\u00b10.055 and p6 = 0.672\u00b10.073, where the range represented by the \u00b1 values is the\n95% confidence interval. The parameterizations of Sku and Asu can thus be deduced,\n\nSku = B cos (?) (3.29)\n\nand\n\nAsu = B sin (?) . (3.30)\n\nFig. 3.36 shows the parameterization curves of Sku and Asu, as a function of Ur\n\nand the data points in which the RRR12 parameterization is based.\n\nIn order to compare the numerical results with the parameterization, the velocity\n\nnonlinearities must be calculated. As it was shown before, SERR1D model represents\n\nwell the free-surface elevation evolution and the wave nonlinearities. However, since\n\nit calculates the velocity integrated over the entire water column, it overestimates the\n\nexperimental velocity. Although for the velocity asymmetry the model still provides\n\na correct estimation, it overestimates velocity skewness along the beach profile (in\n\nup to 22%, for A3, see Fig. A.1).

Grey circles mark the data points corresponding\nto positions after the breakpoint.\n\nby the RRR12 parameterization to investigate the capacity of the parameterization\n\nfor predicting the nonlinearity of wave conditions with different characteristics. This\n\ncomparison is depicted in Figs. 3.39, 3.40, 3.41 and 3.42, for varying offshore Hm0, Tp\n\nand spectral bandwidth and beach slope, respectively.\n\nThe different wave and beach characteristics result in a deviation from the curves\n\nof the RRR12 parameterization and an over- or underestimation of the nonlinearities,\n\nwhich can be summed up in the following points:\n\n? the underestimation of Sku and B increases with decreasing offshore wave height\n\n(Fig. 3.39), increasing offshore wave period (Fig. 3.40) and decreasing beach slope\n\n(Fig. 3.42), especially after breaking;\n\n? for very-long-period waves Asu is underestimated in the shoaling zone (Fig. 3.40);\n\n? for very steep slopes (tan(?)?1 = 1/20, Fig. 3.42), phasing is underestimated\n\nafter breaking (which is in accordance with the limit of application of the para-\n\nmeterization prescribed by Ruessink et al. (2012): it should not be applied when\n\ntan(?)?1 = 1/20);\n\n? narrowing the bandwidth increases the underestimation of Sku and B along the\n\nentire profile (even in the end of the shoaling);\n\n?

Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.4\n\nwave conditions and beach slopes, while corresponding B values are underestim-\n\nated;\n\n? Sku is more influenced by the characteristics of the wave conditions and the beach\n\nslope than Asu.\n\nThe small overestimation of Asu and of ? present for all conditions is inherent to\n\nthe computation of u? from the numerical ?, which has a small cross-shore shift of 3-4\n\nm between numerical results and experimental data. However, since the major changes\n\nof the nonlinearity are driven by Sku changes, this shift is of minor importance for the\n\nfollowing analysis.\n\nMost wave conditions simulated have Sku and Asu values that fall within the cloud\n\nof points presented by Ruessink et al. (2012) (Fig. 3.36). However, that cloud of points\n\nhas a considerable scatter around the parameterization trend and thus, for one same\n\nUr value, the Sku and Asu can vary between 0 and 1.5. Hence, for some of the wave\n\nconditions simulated, the Sku overestimation may reach more than 100%. Therefore, the\n\nhypothesis that Ur is not the unique parameter that defines the nonlinearity of the waves\n\nalong the entire profile, already proposed by other researchers (see subsection 3.3.5),\n\nseems very likely. This is particularly evident for the greatest values of nonlinearity,\n\ncorresponding to cross-shore positions near the end of shoaling and throughout the\n\nsurf zone, meaning that the greater misestimation of the velocity nonlinearities is\n\nprecisely focused on the zones of the profile where they contribute the most for sediment\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nS\nk\nu\n\nHm0 = 0.03 m\n\nHm0 = 0.07 m\n\nHm0 = 0.1 m\n\nHm0 = 0.13 m\n\n10?3 10?2 10?1 100 101 102\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nUr\n\nA\ns\nu\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nB\n\n10?3 10?2 10?1 100 101 102\n?90\n?60\n?30\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\nUr\n\n?\n\nFigure 3.39: Velocity skewness, velocity asymmetry, B and ? in function of Ur, for different-Hm0\nruns.

The black curves correspond to the RRR12 parameterization. Grey circles mark the data points\ncorresponding to cross-shore positions after the breakpoint.\n\ntransport.\n\nSince the RRR12 parameterization has been recently used by several researchers\n\nto calculate the sediment transport related to velocity skewness and asymmetry (e.g.\n\nAagaard &amp; Jensen 2013; Dubarbier et al. 2015), it is of interest to seek its improvement\n\nto ameliorate the estimations of sediment transport. Abreu et al. (2014) has shown\n\nthat varying the values of the p parameters in the RRR12 formulation within the\n\nerror intervals defined by Ruessink et al. (2012) (which somehow take into account\n\nthe dispersion of the experimental values) did not change significantly the predicted\n\nmorphodynamics of the littoral bar in the LIP experiments (Arcilla et al., 1994). Hence,\n\nthe inclusion of other non-local parameters may be a good contribution to improve the\n\nRRR12 parameterization, so that it can adjust to more varied wave conditions and\n\nbeach slopes. The common characteristics of the wave conditions with nonlinearity\n\nvalues that tend to deviate more from the predicted curves can help in underpinning\n\nthe parameters necessary for this adjustment.\n\n3.4.5 Dependence of nonlinearities on the new parameter NP 0\n\nand on ?\n\nTwo characteristics of the wave conditions for which Sku and B values were shown\n\nto deviate from the main cloud of data points were smaller wave heights and longer\n\nperiods. For the same wave period, if the offshore wave height is decreased (Fig. 3.39),\n\n93\n\n\n\nSection 3.4 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\noffshore wave steepness (H0/L0) is also decreased. If instead it is the wave height that is\n\nkept constant and the wave period increased (Fig. 3.40), wave steepness also decreases.\n\nThis suggests that small wave steepness is the characteristic promoting the deviation of\n\nSku and B values of wave conditions with small wave heights and long wave periods\n\nfrom the RRR12 parameterization. Besides small offshore wave steepness, also very\n\nsteep or very gentle beach slopes tend to deviate Sku and B values from the RRR12\n\nparameterization curves.\n\nThe Iribarren number (eq. 3.26) includes both the contribution of the beach slope and\n\nthe square-root of wave steepness. However, since the wave steepness is included through\n\nits square-root, its effect on the variation of the nonlinearity is minored. Consequently,\n\nit is also considered separately from the Ib parameter. The dependence of the Sk?,max\n\non both parameters (offshore wave steepness and Iribarren) is depicted in the first and\n\nsecond plots of Fig. 3.43, for GLOBEX (A1, A2 and A3) and vN2003 (C-1, C-2, C-3,\n\nD-1, D-2, D-3) experimental data.\n\nNeither the offshore wave steepness nor the Iribarren number are shown to be able\n\nof fully describing the variation of nonlinearity as a function of the wave condition\n\nconsidered. Therefore, a new combined parameter, NP0 = Ib0(H0/L0)\n2 is defined\n\n(third plot of Fig. 3.43). This parameter includes the influence of the beach slope,\n\nthrough the Ib0 parameter, and the influence of offshore wave steepness, but magnified,\n\nthrough (H0/L0)\n2. The third plot of Fig. 3.43 depicts the dependence of Sk?,max on\n\nNP0, which indicates a marked decrease from higher values of nonlinearity, for lower\n\nvalues of NP0, to lower values of nonlinearity, for higher values of NP0. The same\n\ndependence of Sk?,max on NP0 is observed for the numerical data, presented in Fig.\n\n3.44.\n\nDeparting from the power dependence of Sk?,max on NP0, the dependence on this\n\nparameter on other measures of nonlinearity (Sku,max, Bmax and the value of ? at\n\n0.01 0.02 0.03\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nH0/L0\n\nS\nk\n?\n,\nm\na\nx\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3\n\nIb0\n\n0.5 1 1.5\n\n\u00b710?4NP0\n\nGLOBEX A series\n\nvan Noorloos C series\n\nvan Noorloos D series\n\nFigure 3.43: Dependency of Sk?,max on H0/L0, Ib0 and NP0, for experimental data.

The influence of ? induces a\n\nvariation of nonlinearity that is smaller than that associated with NP0, but independent\n\nof wave steepness and beach slope (and thus of NP0 as well).\n\n3.4.6 Improved parameterization (mRRR12)\n\nThe main aim of finding a dependence of nonlinearity on parameters other than the\n\nUrsell number, is to reduce the dispersion of RRR12 parameterization and thus allow a\n\nbetter representation of velocity nonlinearities for distinct wave conditions, in different\n\nbeaches. Therefore, the relationship between the nonlinear parameters and NP0 must\n\nbe included in the parameterization.\n\nThe non-dimensional parameters p1-p6 (see eqs. 3.27 and 3.28) can be used to change\n\nthe shape of the RRR12 parameterization curves. In particular, p2 is responsible for the\n\ndefinition of the Bmax value and p5 determines the value of ? at Ur=1. Fig. 3.45 shows\n\n95\n\n\n\nSection 3.4 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nthat a relationship between Bmax and NP0 can be retrieved. Besides this relationship,\n\nif only the changing-? runs are considered, a different power relationship can be found\n\nbetween Bmax and ?. Bmax (and p2) can, thus, be defined in function of NP0 and ?\n\naccording to\n\np2 = Bmax(NP0,?) = q1 \u00b7NP0q2 + q3 \u00b7?q4 + q5, (3.31)\n\nwith q1 = 0.160\u00b10.062, q2 = ?0.190\u00b10.038, q3 = ?0.333\u00b10.118, q4 = ?0.218\u00b10.183\nand q5 = 0.186 \u00b1 0.127, where the range represented by the \u00b1 values is the 95%\nconfidence interval. The first part of eq. 3.31, q1NP\n\nq2\n0 , represents the dependence of p2\n\non NP0. The second part, q3?\nq4 + q5, represents the dependence on ?. The value of q5\n\nis defined to include the best adjustment to the trend of the first part of eq. 3.31. The\n\np5 term, linked to ?(Ur=1) can analogously be defined in function of NP0 and ?, as\n\np5 = arctanh\n\n[\n?(NP0) + 90\n\n90\n\n]\n= arctanh\n\n[\n(q6 \u00b7NP0q7 + q8 \u00b7?q9 ) + 90\n\n90\n\n]\n, (3.32)\n\nwith q6 = ?2.701 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 8.9915, q7 = 1.121 \u00b1 0.062, q8 = ?7.001 \u00b1 13.389 and\nq9 = 0.098 \u00b1 0.119. The coefficients q1-q9 were obtained fitting the data with a robust\nleast squares power fit. The fits were obtained with an R2 of (i) 0.898, for Bmax(NP0),\n\n(ii) 0.924, for Bmax(?), (ii) 0.666, for ?(Ur=1)(NP0) and (iv) 0.964, for ?(Ur=1)(?).\n\nFig. 3.46 shows an example of the application of the modified parameterization to\n\nthe GLOBEX wave conditions. When the dependence of p2 and p5 terms on NP0 and\n\n? is included in the parameterization, it can adapt to the nonlinearity evolution of each\n\nwave condition. Figs. 3.47 and 3.48 summarize the results of the application of the\n\nmRRR12 parameterization.\n\nIn Fig. 3.47, the results obtained with the mRRR12 (coloured markers in Fig.\n\n3.47) for the nonlinearities are compared with the results obtained using RRR12\n\nparameterization (grey markers in Fig. 3.47) and the root-mean-square errors (RMSE,\n\ncalculated between the data and the parameterization curves) are shown (the values\n\ninside the parentheses correspond to the calculations made considering only data points\n\nfor which Sku > 0.3). Fig. 3.48 shows the improvement of the RMSE from the RRR12\n\nto the mRRR12 parameterization, for each of the wave conditions, considering, once\n\nagain, either all data points (darker markers) or only data points for which Sku > 0.3\n\n(lighter markers). This helps in evaluating for which wave conditions and nonlinearity\n\nparameters the improvement is more significant.\n\nThe results of the application of the mRRR12 parameterization can be summed up:\n\n? The underestimation of Sku is reduced (in terms of RMSE) by 26% (or 64% for\n\ndata with Sku > 0.3);\n\n96\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

The improvement of Sk and As is generally greater for wave conditions with longer\n\noffshore peak period or smaller offshore wave height (smaller wave steepness),\n\nmore narrow-banded spectra and very gentle slopes;\n\n? For the four nonlinearity parameters, the improvement is greater for greater values\n\nof nonlinearity.\n\nThe ? values of the data have a greater scatter, and thus the fit is poorer, which\n\nresults in a smaller improvement than for the other parameters. However, it was\n\nshown that Sk and B are the most affected by the different characteristics of the wave\n\nconditions and for these parameters the improvement is of almost 30% (and of 64%, for\n\nSku and 48%, for B, when Sku\u00bf0.3).

The very gently-sloping beach of the\n\nexperiments allows a great development of the nonlinearity of the waves and the high-\n\nresolution data collection, in time and in space, provides a high quality data set for\n\ninvestigating it. A detailed data analysis, presented in the first section of this chapter,\n\nsuggested variations of free-surface elevation and velocity nonlinearities depending on\n\nsome characteristics of the wave conditions considered. Field data previously collected\n\nreinforced the idea that particular characteristics of each wave condition (wave history)\n\nmay determine how the nonlinearity develops and the maximal values it reaches.\n\nThe SERR1D numerical model was used for simulating a wide range of wave condi-\n\ntions, aimed at exploring the importance of different parameters in the development of\n\nthe nonlinearities. The model was validated with GLOBEX data, both for free-surface\n\nelevation and velocity measurements. An overestimation of urms and Sku is inherent\n\nto the model, and thus an alternative was proposed to obtain velocity time series\n\nfrom the free-surface-elevation time series. Since only three different irregular wave\n\n99\n\n\n\nSection 3.5 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\nconditions were available from GLOBEX data, the vN2003 data set, with different wave\n\nconditions and beach slope, was also used to validate the model. This helped assessing\n\nthe capacity of the model to simulate a range of wave conditions beyond that of the\n\nthree irregular-wave cases of GLOBEX.\n\nWave conditions with different offshore wave height, peak period and spectral band-\n\nwidth and beach slope were simulated for irregular-wave conditions and, for bichromatic-\n\nwave conditions, IG-wave height was varied through the changing of the modulation of\n\nshort-wave groups. All the parameters varied were shown to contribute to more or less\n\nsignificant changes of the evolution of wave nonlinearity, in particular regarding the\n\nmaximum values attained.\n\nThe analysis of the bichromatic wave conditions is brief, since the model was cal-\n\nibrated for the irregular-wave conditions, and thus it is for these last conditions that\n\nit works the best. Some issues remain to be investigated further in order to allow a\n\nbetter simulation of the bichromatic-wave conditions by SERR1D, such as the existence\n\nof a short-wave reformation zone in the mid-surf zone and the presence of multiple\n\npeaks of Sk and As. Nevertheless, it was still possible to highlight the importance of\n\nIG waves on the nonlinearities, especially on skewness. Contrary to the irregular-wave\n\nconditions, which have a single skewness maximum until the end of the surf zone, the\n\nbichromatic-wave conditions reach multiple local maxima along the beach profile. Two\n\nof these maxima (the first and the third) are associated to the first breaking and to the\n\nshort-wave reformation in the mid-surf zone. One of the other Sk? maxima (the second)\n\nwas shown to be associated with the presence of IG waves, since (i) for it to exist, a\n\ncertain degree of IG-wave modulation is necessary and (ii) this maximum corresponds\n\nto a maximum of the correlation between short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity. It\n\nis potentially associated with a local IG-wave height minimum, but further research is\n\nnecessary for drawing stronger conclusions.\n\nIn order to understand how important is the influence of different parameters in the\n\nnonlinearities, the results obtained from the simulation of the irregular-wave conditions\n\nwere compared to the results of RRR12 (Ruessink et al., 2012) parameterization. This\n\nparameterization provides an estimation of velocity nonlinearities based on local wave-\n\nparameters only (the Ursell number). It is based on a great amount of field data, to\n\nwhich it provides the best-fit, but not without a significant dispersion. When it is applied\n\nto the results obtained for the different wave conditions simulated, it is shown that\n\nsignificant errors can occur, particularly for wave conditions with certain characteristics.\n\nFrom the analysis of the different wave conditions for which the parameterization gives\n\nthe largest estimation errors, it can be concluded that the offshore wave steepness, in\n\nparticular, and also the beach slope and spectral bandwidth are the three main factors\n\n100\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.5\n\nthat are linked to the nonlinearity values that have a greater deviation from the RRR12\n\nparameterization. Therefore, a modification to the original the RRR12 parameterization\n\nis proposed, which includes the effects of these three factors.\n\nA modified version of the Iribarren parameter, the nonlinearity parameter (NP0), is\n\nsuggested, in order to include the dependence of the nonlinearities on offshore wave\n\nsteepness and beach slope. This parameter includes the contribution of the beach slope,\n\nthrough the classical Ib0 parameter, and the increased contribution of the offshore wave\n\nsteepness, (H0/L0)\n2. The maximum value of nonlinearity reached for each condition is\n\nshown to depend, through a power law, on NP0 and ?. Therefore, both parameters\n\nare included in the RRR12 parameterization, via p2 and p5 terms. The inclusion of\n\nboth NP0 and ? on the RRR12 parameterization results in a reduction of the RMSE\n\nbetween predicted and real values estimated at around 30%, for Sku, Asu and B and\n\n7% for ?. When only data points for which Sku > 0.3 (corresponding to cross-shore\n\npositions onshore of the outer-shoaling zone) are considered in the calculation of RMSE,\n\nthe reduction of the RMSE between predicted and real values is estimated instead at\n\n64%, for B, and around 50% for the other three nonlinearity variables. Overall, the\n\ngreatest improvement is observed for the wave conditions with smaller offshore wave\n\nsteepness and narrower spectral bandwidth and beaches with very gentle or very steep\n\nslopes, and for the greatest nonlinearity values (near the breakpoint).\n\nIt was clearly shown that the free-surface elevation and velocity nonlinearities cannot\n\nbe defined only based on local wave parameters. The history of the waves propagating,\n\nincluding the offshore wave characteristics and the beach over which they propagate,\n\nhas to be taken into account as well, if an accurate description of the evolution of the\n\nwave nonlinearities along the beach profile is intended.\n\n101\n\n\n\nSection 3.5 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities\n\n102\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe role of infragravity waves in\n\nthe beach morphodynamics\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nThe existence of infragravity waves has been proven since the fifties (Munk, 1949;\n\nBie?sel, 1952; Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart, 1962), mostly from field data, and since then\n\na panoply of field, laboratory and numerical studies have been trying to shed some more\n\nlight on the issue. Most of the research done so far on the hydrodynamics of IG waves has\n\nfocused on understanding their mechanisms of generation and reflection/dissipation at\n\nthe shoreline (e.g. Symonds et al., 1982; Schaffer, 1993; Herbers et al., 1995; Masselink,\n\n1995; Sheremet et al., 2002; Battjes et al., 2004). More recently, research has also been\n\nfocusing on unraveling the mechanisms of energy transfer between the short waves and\n\nthe IG waves and the possibility of IG-wave breaking (e.g. Henderson et al., 2006; van\n\nDongeren et al., 2007; Ruju et al., 2012; Guedes et al., 2013; de Bakker et al., 2015b).\n\nLittle after the acquaintance of the existence of these low-frequency waves, the research\n\ncommunity started trying to understand if they could also have a significant influence\n\non sediment transport, and if so, by which mechanism(s) (e.g. Wright &amp; Short, 1984;\n\nBeach &amp; Sternberg, 1988; Roelvink &amp; Stive, 1989; Beach &amp; Sternberg, 1991; Aagaard\n\n&amp; Greenwood, 1994, 1995; Ruessink et al., 1998b; Aagaard &amp; Greenwood, 2008).\n\nWhile the mechanisms of IG-wave generation and even dissipation are now starting\n\nto be significantly well understood, the influence of these waves on sediment transport\n\nis still very unclear. Whether they are capable of suspending sediment alone or only of\n\nadvecting sediment stirred by short waves or even simply influence sediment transport\n\nby modulating short-wave nonlinearities, remains an unsolved issue. Furthermore, the\n\nIG-wave contribution can result in both offshore- and onshore-directed fluxes depend-\n\ning on the relative phase between the velocity and sediment concentration (Beach\n\n103\n\n\n\nSection 4.1 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\n&amp; Sternberg, 1991). The confirmed link between these low-frequency waves and the\n\nswash motion further adds to the complexity of the IG-wave influence on the beach\n\nmorphology and is also an ongoing topic of research (Ruju et al., 2014).\n\nMost studies about the cross-shore sediment transport in the nearshore zone have\n\nshown that, in the shoaling zone, the onshore-directed transport by short-waves domin-\n\nates the total particle flux and the IG-wave sediment transport is generally an order of\n\nmagnitude smaller (Baldock et al., 2011). Effectively, Ruessink et al. (1998a) found the\n\nrelative contribution of bound IG waves to the gross sediment transport to be small (on\n\naverage, less than 10-20%). However, near the end of the shoaling zone, these authors\n\nconsidered that, since the suspended sediment transport is a delicate balance between\n\ntwo components of approximately equal magnitude but opposite directions (short-wave\n\nskewness and undertow), the small contribution of infragravity waves may sometimes\n\nnot be negligible and have a relatively large influence on the magnitude and direction of\n\nthe net suspended sediment transport. The largest sediment concentrations are present\n\nunder the bound IG-wave troughs, since it corresponds to the largest short waves, which\n\nexert larger bed shear stresses. The transport by the bound IG waves is thus directed\n\noffshore (Osborne &amp; Greenwood, 1992b), as it is associated with the offshore stroke of\n\nthese waves. Free IG waves, on the other hand, are considered by the later authors as\n\nunimportant under non-breaking wave conditions.\n\nShoreward of the breakpoint, the opinions on IG-wave sediment transport direction\n\ndiverge, and no clear model exists so far (Baldock et al., 2010). The most important\n\nsediment transport mechanism is generally considered to be the wave-driven undertow,\n\nalthough free IG-wave motion may as well be of importance, especially on dissipative\n\nbeaches (e.g. Beach &amp; Sternberg, 1991; Osborne &amp; Greenwood, 1992a; Aagaard &amp;\n\nGreenwood, 1994). Different authors have observed contradictory directions of sediment\n\ntransport by IG waves in this zone of the beach profile (Beach &amp; Sternberg, 1988,\n\n1991; Osborne &amp; Greenwood, 1992b; Russell, 1993; Aagaard &amp; Greenwood, 1995, 2008).\n\nShort (1975) has proposed that sediment deposition will tend to occur under nodes\n\nor anti-nodes of the IG waves and Michallet et al. (2007) have later shown partial\n\nevidence of a nodal structure consistent with the cross-shore bar position. On the other\n\nhand, Prel et al. (2011) have seen IG-wave motion to influence sediment transport\n\nby modulation of the short-wave skewness and asymmetry, but they did not find bar\n\nformation to be consistently located under nodes or anti-nodes of standing waves.\n\nFollowing a different approach, Aagaard &amp; Greenwood (1995) have argued that IG\n\nwaves may be important to morphological change in the surf zone by imposing spatial\n\ngradients on sediment transport associated with mean currents: the asymmetries of\n\nthe oscillatory velocities in the bottom boundary layer associated with these waves\n\n104\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.1\n\nimply greater velocities and thus a net transport towards the antinodes. An alternative\n\nscenario is an interaction between IG-wave free-surface elevation and incident wave\n\nvelocities, in which IG-wave velocity asymmetries are still required to cause a net\n\nsediment transport towards free-surface elevation antinodes. Following these hypothesis,\n\nAagaard &amp; Greenwood (2008) showed that, particularly in the inner-surf zone, sand is\n\nmostly re-suspended by orbital velocities associated with incident wind waves, but it\n\nis the IG waves that then act as a sediment transport agent through advection, in a\n\nmanner similar to quasi-steady mean currents. Hence, they can potentially dominate\n\nthe total transport of suspended sediment in this zone of the beach.\n\nThe LEGI (Laboratoire des E?coulements Ge?ophysiques et Industriels, Grenoble,\n\nFrance) wave flume, a light-weight-sediment flume, has already been used for studying\n\nthe wave propagation, the effects of wave nonlinearities on sediment transport (Michallet\n\net al., 2011; Grasso et al., 2011) and the boundary-layer dynamics (Berni et al., 2013),\n\nbut also the influence of IG waves on sediment transport (Michallet et al., 2007; Prel\n\net al., 2011). Since few laboratory experiments have been done so far on the role of\n\ninfragravity waves on the sediment transport and many questions remain unanswered\n\nregarding this topic, the aim of this chapter is to improve this knowledge, through an\n\nimportant set of laboratory experiments held in the LEGI wave flume.\n\nLong runs, with a timescale of a few hours, and short runs, with a timescale of only\n\ntwo wave groups (27.2 s), were ran, for three distinct bichromatic wave conditions.\n\nBichromatic wave conditions have the great advantage that the height and period of\n\nthe IG-waves associated to the short-wave groups can easily be selected and controlled.\n\nHence, in the experiments presented in this chapter, the IG-wave height was varied,\n\nkeeping the same short-wave height and energy. Therefore, the changes in the effect of\n\neach wave condition to the beach profile are necessarily linked, directly or indirectly, to\n\nthe differences in the IG waves considered. The analysis is done considering free-surface\n\nelevation and velocity measurements and bed-profile changes.\n\nThe research questions motivating this chapter aim at responding to the fundamental\n\nquestion of what is the influence of IG waves on sediment transport. This question can\n\nthen be detailed into more specific questions:\n\n? Can IG waves influence the sediment transport by short-waves? By which mech-\n\nanism(s)?\n\n? Can IG waves work together with short-waves in the sediment transport, combining\n\ndifferent transport mechanisms?\n\n? Can free IG waves alone (without the presence of short waves) promote sediment\n\ntransport?\n\n105\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\n? What is the importance of the IG waves for the sediment transport in the different\n\nzones of the beach profile?\n\n? Can IG waves influence the shape of equilibrium profiles?\n\nThis chapter starts by an instruments and methods section, where the experimental\n\nfacility and wave conditions are described and the different types of measurements\n\nperformed during the experiments are presented and their applications and limitations\n\nare discussed. In the subsequent section, the concept of equilibrium beach profile and\n\nevolution towards equilibrium are discussed for the different wave conditions. Since\n\na distinct equilibrium profile is observed for each wave condition, a more thorough\n\nanalysis of the morphodynamics associated to each wave condition is performed in\n\nthe ensuing section, where runs of only two wave groups are considered to simplify\n\nthe research of the various processes influencing sediment transport. An analysis of\n\nthe hydrodynamics, taking into account both free-surface elevation and cross-shore\n\nvelocity, is then carried out to explain the disparity in the morphological evolution\n\nbetween wave conditions. The SERR1D model, previously presented in chapter 3, is\n\nused to obtain velocity measurements around the breakpoint and in the surf zone, where\n\naccurate velocity measurements are difficult to get with the acoustic instruments. The\n\ninfluence of monochromatic IG waves in the sediment transport is briefly debated and\n\nsubsequently the different mechanisms shown to be involved in the sediment transport\n\nby the IG waves are examined in the discussion section. The chapter ends with a\n\nconclusion.\n\n4.2 Instruments and methods\n\n4.2.1 The LEGI wave flume\n\nThe LEGI flume, presented in Fig. 4.1a, is a 36 m-long and 0.55 m-wide wave flume,\n\nwith vertical glass walls and equipped with a piston-type wave-maker. This wave-maker,\n\nas shown in Fig. 4.1b, consists in a vertical board driven by a servo-valve, which can\n\nreach a maximum displacement of \u00b130 cm along the horizontal direction and allows\nthe reproduction of regular or irregular waves. Although it can generate short and IG\n\nwaves, the wave-maker is not capable of active reflection compensation, meaning that\n\nany IG waves generated in the flume that reach the wave-maker will be reflected back,\n\nenhancing standing or partially-standing IG waves that oscillate in the flume until they\n\ndissipate.\n\nThe laboratory beach, represented in Fig. 4.2 scheme, is formed by Polymethyl\n\nMethacrylate (also known as Plexiglas) low-density (?s = 1.19 g cm\n-3) sediments, with a\n\n106\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The wave gauges were moved to convenient\n\nlocations depending on the run. The ADV was also moved both cross-shore (from run\n\nto run) and in the vertical (for 5-20 min intervals during some of the runs) to have a\n\n0 xi xs xf\nh0\n\n0\n\nDistance (m)\n\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n(m\n\n) x\n\nz\n\nwave maker\n\nh(x)\n\nmean water level at rest\n\nhs(x)\n\nlp\n\nFigure 4.2: Schematic diagram of the LEGI wave flume: h0 is the mean water level at rest at the wave\nmaker (around 56.60 cm for the experiments that will be presented); lp is the length of the measured\nprofiles, from xi = 6.5 m to xf = 29 m; xs is the cross-shore position of the shoreline; h(x) is the\nwater depth and hs(x) the sediment height, both in function of x cross-shore position.\n\n107\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Chapter 4.

The physics and hydraulics of movable bed models depend on the\n\nwave parameters (significant wave height Hs and peak period Tp), sediment parameters\n\n(sediment diameter d and density of the sediment ?s) the water depth h, the fluid\n\ndensity ?, the fluid kinematic viscosity ? and the gravity g (Grasso et al., 2009a). These\n\nvariables must be correctly scaled to their nature equivalents to allow the truthful\n\nrepresentation of the fundamental processes aimed to be characterized. Since it is\n\nvery difficult to scale the eight independent parameters mentioned, the choice of the\n\nparameters to scale is done based on the principal processes that are aimed at being\n\nsimulated by the physical model.\n\nThe Froude scaling is essential in physical models that involve waves (Dean &amp;\n\nDalrymple, 2002) and can be written as\n\nF =\nHs?p\n\n2\n?\ngh\n, (4.1)\n\nwhere ?p = 2?/Tp is the angular frequency. Since wave dynamics, shoaling, breaking\n\nand turbulence generation by the waves must be modelled correctly, an undistorted\n\nmodel is chosen. Therefore, a single length scale ?l is chosen (?i is the ratio of the\n\nmodel value to the prototype value of parameter i). Respecting the Froude similitude\n\nbetween nature and the model implies that the time scale, ?t =\n?\n?l. Grasso (2009)\n\n108\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.2\n\nhas shown that choosing a length scale of 1/10 relative to nature (which implies a time\n\nscale of 1/3 and thus a velocity scale of 1/3) allows the reproduction of beach profiles\n\nthat can be found on real beaches with sediments with a median diameter of 0.3 mm.\n\nThe wave Reynolds number can be calculated according to\n\nRe =\nA?ph\n\n?\n, (4.2)\n\nwith ? the fluid viscosity and A the particle excursion at the bottom,\n\nA =\nHrms\n\n2 sinh (kh)\n, (4.3)\n\nwhere k is the wave number. Even though this number is not scaled in the experiments\n\nand is smaller than in nature, it is large enough for the flow to be turbulent.\n\nFor ensuring sediment transport similitude, Shields and Rouse scalings are adopted.\n\nThe Shields number is calculated as\n\n? =\n1\n\n2\nfw\n\n(A?p)\n2\n\ng(?s/?? 1)d50\n, (4.4)\n\nwhere fw is a wave friction factor (Swart, 1974), which can be approximated as\n\nfw = exp\n\n[\n5.213\n\n(\n2.5 \u00d7d50\n\nA\n\n)0.194\n? 5.977\n\n]\n. (4.5)\n\nThe Rouse number can be expressed as\n\nRou =\nws\nu?\n, (4.6)\n\nwith u? the turbulent intensity of the flow field, approximated by ?\n?\nfw/2A?p (with\n\n? the von Karman constant = 0.4 (Soulsby, 1997)). The Shields number defines\n\nthe threshold for setting the sediment in motion and the transport regime (bed load,\n\nsuspension, sheet flow, etc.) and the Rouse number can be seen as the ratio between a\n\nturbulent timescale and a settling timescale (for a given characteristic length).\n\nThe Dean number (Dean, 1973) (recall, ? = Hs\nTpws\n\n) was constant and of about 3.4\n\n(Hs = 0.12 m, Tp = 1.7 s, ws = 0.021 m s\n-1) for the experiments performed, which\n\nplaces all the beach profiles obtained in the intermediate range of Wright &amp; Short (1984)\n\nclassification (presented in chapter 2). These profiles are characterized by beaches\n\nwith a moderate mean slope and spilling or plunging breakers and can have bar-trough\n\nsystems, rhythmic bars and terraces.\n\nPrevious authors (Grasso et al., 2009a,b) have studied in depth the scaling of the\n\n109\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nLEGI wave flume and compared it to natural beaches that also have intermediate profile\n\ntypes. They have found the overall beach hydrodynamics and morphodynamics to be\n\ncorrectly reproduced by fulfilling the three scalings mentioned.\n\n4.2.2 Wave conditions\n\nThe main aim of the experiments held in the flume was to understand the importance\n\nof infragravity waves on sediment transport. Bichromatic waves were chosen instead\n\nof irregular waves (which would be more similar to nature) so that only two different\n\nsinusoidal wave components are generated by the wave-maker, together with the lower\n\nfrequency of the bound wave resulting from the difference interaction between the two\n\nmain components. As the waves propagate and evolve along the flume, it is thus easier\n\nto track the developing of higher and lower harmonics, as they tend to be multiples of\n\nthe main frequencies f1 and f2, or of the bound IG wave frequency, f2 ?f1. Baldock\net al. (2011) have previously shown that a given bichromatic-wave condition with the\n\nsame short-wave energy of a given irregular-wave condition is capable of generating\n\na similar sediment transport. Therefore, in this work, bichromatic-wave conditions\n\nare used instead of irregular-wave conditions in the study of the effect of IG waves in\n\nthe sediment transport. This greatly simplifies the processes to be studied, due to the\n\nregularity and repeatability of the waves propagating and makes it easier to control the\n\nIG frequencies present in the flume.\n\nAt the first order, the free-surface elevation for bichromatic waves can be analytically\n\ncalculated as it follows,\n\n? (x,t) = A1 cos (w1t?k1x) + A2 cos (w2t?k2x) , (4.7)\n\nwhere A is the wave amplitude (= H/2), k the wave number, ? the angular frequency\n\nand x and t the time and space coordinates, respectively. The indexes 1 and 2 represent\n\neach main frequency.\n\nThe theoretical solution for the wave-maker displacement was computed according\n\nto Hughes (1993) and included second-order compensating generation to correctly\n\nreproduce the bound IG wave.\n\nThree different bichromatic wave conditions with the same short-wave energy were\n\ndesigned: C1 (first-order solution with addition of free IG waves of opposite sign\n\nto that of the bound IG waves), C2 (standard condition) and C3 (smaller IG-wave\n\namplitude than C2). For the three, short-wave Hs = 14.8 cm and Tp = 1.7 s and the\n\ntwo main frequencies were f1 = 0.5515 Hz and f2 = 0.6250 Hz (TIG or Tg = 13.6 s).\n\nThe frequencies were chosen so that fp =\nf1+f2\n\n2\n. The time series of the wave conditions\n\n110\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.2\n\nwere composed by successive pairs of two wave groups (which had slightly different\n\nshort-waves between them). C1 and C2 had a maximum modulation, with a1 and a2\n\nof 0.03 m, while C3 had smaller modulation, with a1 = 0.0413 and a2 = 0.01 m. The\n\ndifference between C1 and C2 was subtler and linked to the generation process. In the\n\ncase of C2, the IG wave reproduced by the wave-maker corresponded to the second-order\n\nbound wave computed and expected to develop as the waves start propagating. Forcing\n\nthis IG wave in the theoretical solution ensures that it establishes correctly in the flume\n\nas the waves propagate. For C1, this IG wave was generated by the wave-maker in the\n\ndirection opposite to that of wave propagation. Since an IG bound wave still develops\n\nanyway as the wave groups propagate, the IG wave that was artificially generated with\n\nan opposite direction of propagation behaves as an additional free-wave propagating\n\nin the flume, with a phase relative to the wave group that is distinct from that of the\n\nbound wave. This results in both additional IG-wave energy and a different IG phasing\n\nfrom that of C2.\n\nFig. 4.4 helps understand the differences between the wave conditions. At x = 9 m,\n\nthe main differences between C1 and C2 are in terms of IG-wave phasing. The spectral\n\npeak corresponding to the bound IG waves (f2 ?f1) has roughly the same energy for\nboth conditions (for C2, it has 1.5 times more energy than for C1). However, at the\n\nend of shoaling, IG waves have an energy about 4 times greater for C1 than C2. For\n\nthe first harmonic of the bound IG wave (2 (f2 ?f1)), C1 also has higher energy than\nC2 and C3.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nof magnitude smaller than C1 and C2, which can also be seen in the time series as a\n\nmuch smaller bound IG wave. C3 has also less energy on harmonics of f2 frequency\n\nthan the other two conditions.\n\nThe duration of the wave-maker action was variable, ranging from only two short-\n\nwave groups (about 27.2 s) to longer runs of over 5 h. Apart from C1, C2 and C3, some\n\nruns were also made with free IG-waves only, with the same height and period of the\n\nbound IG waves of C2, or multiples of that height.\n\n4.2.3 Free-surface elevation measurements\n\nFree-surface elevation measurements were made using 12 capacitive wave gauges\n\npositioned along the cross-shore profile. The wave gauges have a precision of 1 mm and\n\na sampling rate of 128 Hz and were calibrated regularly (for details on the calibration,\n\nsee Grasso (2009)). Depending on the runs, the wave gauges were moved to different\n\npositions, in order to get a better coverage of the region of interest. The cut-off between\n\nhigh and low frequencies is considered at half the peak frequency, which corresponds to\n\nthe minimum of the variance density spectrum of ? measured at the wave gauge closest\n\nto the wave-maker (x = 2.01 m). It separates the range of frequencies that initially\n\nhave more energy and will tend to loose energy as the waves propagate towards the\n\ncoast, from the range of frequencies that initially have less energy and will gain energy\n\ncloser to the coast.\n\nThe wave gauge measurements allow the characterization of the hydrodynamics\n\nassociated with each beach profile. Different wave statistics can be computed, such\n\nas the root-mean-square wave height (3.1), for short and infragravity waves, skewness\n\n(3.8), asymmetry (3.9), energy dissipation (3.3) or mean water level (??) to evaluate the\n\nset-up and the set-down. The wave statistics corresponding to each beach profile are\n\ncomputed on a pair number of wave groups, which, for the short runs, corresponds to\n\ntwo wave groups only, and for the long runs depends on the aim for which the statistics\n\nare being calculated.\n\nResonant modes\n\nSince the wave-maker of the LEGI-flume is not equipped with active reflection\n\ncompensation, the free IG waves that reflect at the beach are \u201ctrapped\u201d in the flume,\n\ncreating stationary IG waves and increasing the low-frequency energy present in the\n\nflume. This implies that the IG-wave height may be near zero for the cross-shore\n\nlocations coincident with standing-wave nodes, or maximal, at locations coincident with\n\nthe antinodes.\n\n112\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

On the bottom: the cross-shore structure of the first-four\nresonant modes.\n\nFor each beach profile, the theoretic resonant modes of the IG waves can be\n\ncalculated to help explaining the minima and maxima of IG-wave height measured by\n\nthe wave gauges. Small differences in the shoreline position can influence the distribution\n\nof the nodes and antinodes along the beach profile.

The second normal mode has a period very close to the period of the\n\nshort-wave groups (Tg) and thus of the bound IG wave. Therefore, since the IG-wave\n\nmotion in the flume is preferentially forced at this period, the second normal mode\n\n(f = 0.05-0.085 Hz) is the most enhanced.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nnormal mode is almost equivalent to the total IG-wave height. The fourth mode has\n\nsome relevance in the surf and swash zones, but all the other modes have negligible\n\ncontributions to the total IG-wave height. This is the case for all the three equilibria.\n\nThe greatest difference between conditions consists in the IG-wave height evolution in\n\nthe shoaling zone: for C1, the maximum IG-wave height is reached just before the slope\n\nbreak of the beach profile (around x = 21 m), and for C2, this maximum is located at\n\nthe beginning of the steepening of the beach slope in the shoaling zone (around x = 15\n\nm). For C3, the total IG-wave height is significantly smaller than for C1 and C2 and\n\nthe maximum of the shoaling zone is reached around x = 18 m, where a small \u201cbump\u201d\n\ncan be seen in the equilibrium profile of C1.\n\nSwash-zone wave gauges\n\nThe swash zone is the highest zone of the profile where wave gauges were positioned.\n\nSince this zone is intermittently covered by water, free-surface elevation can only be\n\nretrieved when the wave gauges are immersed. However, even when the water retreats,\n\nthe bed is fully saturated and thus these gauges detect the bed position, which can be\n\nused to track the evolution of the beachface position along the runs. This is depicted in\n\nFig. 4.7, where the black lines represent moments of emersion and thus the position of\n\nthe bed. This allows the quantification of bed-level variation (red crosses in Fig. 4.7)\n\nbetween swash events and the duration of the events (the central point of each black\n\nline is considered to calculate the bed-level variation). These are the only measurements\n\nof the bed position available during wave action, since the bed profiling of the entire\n\nbeach can only be done before or after each wave condition is ran, as the water surface\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n?\n(c\nm\n)\n\n2180 2200 2220 2240 2260\n\n?1.5\n?1\n\n?0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n\nt (s)\n\nB\ne\nd\n-l\ne\nv\ne\nl\n\nv\na\nri\na\nti\no\nn\n(m\n\nm\n)\n\nFigure 4.7: Example of bed-level detection during an interval of a C2 run.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.2\n\nneeds to be completely still. The detection of the bed-position in the time series of the\n\nswash wave gauges was done following the method of Turner et al. (2008).\n\nThe detection of the bed position in the swash zone can also be used to track the\n\neffect of the residual IG waves (at the end of the runs) on the beach. Even though the\n\nshort-runs consisted in only two wave groups to avoid the effects of IG-waves reflected\n\nat the wave-maker, after the arrival of the wave groups to the beach, residual IG waves\n\nkeep oscillating in the flume until their energy if fully dissipated. It is thus important\n\nto be sure that these residual waves are not significantly morphogenic, as this could\n\nbias the interpretation of the results.\n\nFig. 4.8 shows a zoom of the minimum level of the free-surface elevation at two\n\nswash-zone wave gauges (positioned at x = 24.45 m and x = 23.89 m) for a C2 run with\n\na duration of two wave groups. Since the bed is fully saturated in the highest zones of\n\nthe beach and the lower and flatter sections of the curves correspond to moments when\n\nthere is no water, they represent the bed position, similarly to the black flatter sections\n\nin Fig. 4.7 (which shows an experiment with a duration of more than two wave groups).\n\nFor the wave gauge located higher on the beach (x = 24.45 m), bed changes are very\n\nsmall (of the order of 1 mm), whether they are provoked by the passage of the two\n\nwave groups or the residual IG waves. Therefore, in both cases, the waves are hardly\n\nmorphogenic. However, for the other gauge lower in the beach (x = 23.89 m), just at\n\nthe limit of the swash zone, changes are more significant. The first and the second wave\n\ngroups promote the greatest erosion observed during the runs. This erosion is of about\n\n8 mm, for the first wave group, and 2.5 mm, for the second one. The following cycles of\n\nresidual IG waves (together with some small residual short waves) account for changes\n\nan order of magnitude smaller, of around 1 mm. Even though the absolute values of bed\n\nchange may vary a lot depending on the bed profile for each wave condition, the orders\n\nof magnitude are comparable between experiments. Independently of the experiment\n\nconsidered, even though residual IG waves may be weakly morphogenic, the bed change\n\nthey promote is much smaller than that promoted by the two wave groups and can\n\nthus be disregarded.\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nt (s)\n\n?\n(m\n\nm\n)\n\nx = 24.45 m\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n?15\n?10\n?5\n0\n\nt (s)\n\nx = 23.89 m\n\nFigure 4.8: Zoom of the minimum level of the free-surface elevation at two swash-zone wave gauges\nduring one C2 run of two wave groups.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\n4.2.4 Bed profiles\n\nBefore or after each run, the beach-profile position was measured with an optical\n\nlaser beam (with a sampling frequency of 50 Hz) installed on a motorized trolley that\n\nmoved at an almost constant velocity (100 mm s-1) on the metallic rails that run over\n\neach side of the flume. As the trolley moves, the laser beam is emitted towards the\n\nbed and its reflection is retrieved by a receptor located next to the laser source. If\n\nthere are suspended particles in the water column, the laser beam is reflected in those\n\nparticles and does not reach the bed, which results in erroneous measurements of the\n\nbed position. In order to overcome this limitation, a correction procedure is applied.\n\nThe raw measurements of the beach profile are obtained in terms of voltage (Fig. 4.9\n\nA). Then, they are converted to meters, multiplying by a calibration value (Fig. 4.9 B).\n\nThe initial (xi = 6.5 m) and final (xf = 29 m) positions for the profile measurement\n\nare defined before the trolley is set in motion, but, since it does not move at exactly\n\nthe same velocity along the entire flume, the trolley usually stops some centimeters\n\nbefore its defined final position. Therefore, after converting the measurements from\n\nvolts to meters, a correction to the final position is done for having all profiles with\n\nmatching xi and xf . Afterwards, the profile is de-spiked (red profile, Fig. 4.9 C) to\n\nreduce the number of erroneous points obtained by reflection of the laser beam at the\n\nsurface or along the water column. Then, since the bars over which the trolley moves\n\nare not completely horizontal, the bed position is corrected (red to green profile in Fig.\n\n4.9 D) to eliminate this error. Moreover, the laser beam is refracted as it traverses\n\nthe air-water interface and hence, a re-scaling of the profile is done (green to magenta\n\nprofile in Fig. 4.9 D). Finally, since the de-spiking process is not 100 % efficient for all\n\nthe profiles measured, for each profile done from xi to xf , pA (magenta profile in Fig.\n\n4.9 E), another profile is done just after it, from xf to xi, pB (purple profile in Fig. 4.9\n\nE). When a spike is present at a given cross-shore position for one of the profiles, the\n\nvalue of the other profile at that cross-shore position is considered instead. When this\n\ncorrection if done for both pA and pB profiles, the average of both profiles is done and\n\nconsidered as the final profile, p (Fig. 4.9 F).\n\nProfiles were measured between xi = 6.5 m and xf = 29 m (total profile length,\n\nlp = (xf ? xi) = 22.5 m), along the centre of the flume. However, since the part of\nthe profile that is permanently emerged does not change along the runs, xf is often\n\nconsidered in the analysis at 26 m, for convenience. Depending on the analysis wanted\n\nand when no significant change is measured for the greatest depths, xi is considered\n\nfurther onshore than 6.5 m. The profile measurements made were re-sampled so that\n\nthe vertical position of the bed is retrieved each millimeter, on the cross-shore direction.\n\nEven though the correction procedure aims at minimizing the errors inherent to the\n\n116\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nmeasurement of the bed position, it is not perfect. Not all the profile measurement\n\nspikes are completely corrected, especially when at the same location a spike is present\n\nfor both pA and pB. Also, when the water is less clean, light transmission may change\n\nacross the water column. The water was clean regularly but the growth of organic\n\nmatter was dependent on environmental conditions (light, temperature, particles in\n\nthe water, etc) and thus it was hard to have always the same water quality along the\n\nexperiments that were performed during more than two years. As it can be seen in Fig.\n\n4.9 C, for cross-shore positions closer to the wave-maker than x ? 15 m, larger errors\nassociated to the profile measurements. This happens in part due to the higher water\n\ncolumn (that can have more suspended particles) and to changes in the transmissivity\n\nof the water due to the presence of impurities. Also, from the wave-maker until x ?\n8.5 m, the bed of the flume (made of glass) is not covered by sediments, which also\n\ncontributes to measurement errors. The beach morphodynamics below x = 15 m is\n\nnot analysed in this work and is hence excluded from the profile measurement-error\n\nquantification.\n\nIn order to quantify the uncertainty of the bed profile measurements resulting from\n\nthe mentioned factors, the bed profile measurement uncertainty (MU) averaged along\n\nthe length of the beach profile (starting at x = 15 m), MUhm, and the mean relative\n\nerror, MUhrel, are calculated for each beach profile and shown in Fig. 4.10.\n\nMUhm =\n\n?N\nn=1 |hsB, n ?hsA, n|\n\nN\n(4.8)\n\nand\n\nMUhrel =\n\n?N\nn=1 |hsB, n ?hsA,n|/hs, n\n\nN\n\u00d7 100, (4.9)\n\nwhere the indexes A and B correspond to profiles pA and pB, respectively, n is the\n\nindex of the cross-shore point considered, varying from 1 (corresponding to xi = 15 m)\n\nto N (corresponding to xi = 26 m) and |.| denotes the absolute value.\nAveraging MUhm and MUhrel over the entire set of experiments, results in a value\n\nthat can be considered as the measurement uncertainty associated to the bed position\n\nmeasurement for any measured profile. Thus, each bed position measurement has an\n\nuncertainty of \u00b12.1 mm, corresponding to a relative error of \u00b11.0%. The measurement\nuncertainty is, however, dependent on the cross-shore position considered. As it was\n\nmentioned, in deeper water larger errors are associated to the bed position retrieved by\n\nthe laser beam, due to the highest probability of the laser being reflected at particles in\n\nsuspension or due to the water quality. Therefore, the further inshore xi is considered\n\nfor a given analysis, the smaller the measurement uncertainty. This is illustrated by\n\nthe difference between the blue circles and the red asterisks in Fig. 4.10: only by\n\n118\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

A very similar laser-profiling system was recently proposed by\n\nAtkinson &amp; Baldock (2016), which also measures with high resolution the subaerial and\n\nsubaqueous areas of the beach profile.\n\nDifferent useful quantities can be deduced from the measurements of the bed position\n\nthat contribute to the understanding of the change of the beach profile after each\n\nexperiment. Knowing the flume width (L = 0.55 m), the sediment height (hs) and\n\nthe length (lp) of a given profile, and assuming no cross-flume variation, the sediment\n\nvolume (V ) can be calculated,\n\nV = L\n\n? lp\n0\n\nhs(x)dx.

This bed mobilization near\n\nthe breakpoint is illustrated in Fig. 4.12.\n\nFig. 4.13 shows an estimation of the top and bottom limits of the mobile layer\n\naround the breakpoint during a C1 run, from where it can be seen that the lower\n\nlimit of the mobile layer is significantly below the bed position measured by the laser\n\nprofiler before the start/end of the run. However, these are visual observations which\n\nare difficult to precise, in particular because the position of the top and bottom limits\n\nof the mobile layer also change during the run. Fig. 4.14 illustrates this change, at two\n\ndifferent cross-shore positions, during two different time intervals of C1 runs. Periodic\n\noscillations are obvious for both time intervals and cross-shore positions considered.\n\nAlong these oscillations, the thickness of the mobile layer is variable.\n\n4.2.5 Velocity measurements\n\nVelocity measurements considered herein for analysis were done at different cross-\n\nshore and vertical positions, using a side-looking ADV with a sampling rate of 128 Hz.\n\nMeasurements along the cross-shore, alongshore and vertical directions were obtained,\n\nbut the velocity analysis presented herein focuses on the cross-shore velocity. Several\n\nparameters can be retrieved from these measurements, such as the mean (um) or root-\n\nmean-square (urms) velocities and velocity skewness (Sku) and asymmetry (Asu).\n\nObtaining reliable measurements with an ADV requires some care. Measurements\n\ncan become noisy both due to emersion of the four beams of the ADV or due to\n\nstrong sediment-suspension events. In order to distinguish both sources of noise, a joint\n\nanalysis with a collocated wave gauge must be done. When the wave gauges measure a\n\nzero water level, the noise in the velocity measurements is easily linked to the emersion\n\nof the ADV. The greatest problem is posed by the episodes of high concentration of\n\nsuspended sediment in the water, which are more difficult to track. Since this issue is a\n\nnecessary drawback of acoustic instruments, it is essential to know where exactly clean\n\nvelocity measurements can be obtained.\n\nThe cross-shore positions at which it is possible to obtain measurements of velocity\n\nwith no noise during the full time series depend on the beach-profile shape and range\n\nfrom about x = 21.5 m to x = 24 m. For the vertical position of the ADV, a limit of\n\nabout 3 cm height above the bottom is mandatory to avoid measurement noise and the\n\nADV has to be placed at a minimum distance of 3 cm from the free-surface at rest, to\n\ninsure that at least the two lower beams of the probe are immersed during the entire\n\nduration of the runs. These limits must however be considered together with visual\n\nobservation during the experiments, since for some particular positions (such as near\n\nthe breakpoint) sediment suspension may be high, not allowing good measurements\n\n122\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

When isolated spikes were present along the time\n\nseries, they were corrected using both a de-spiking method by Mori et al. (2007) and\n\na low-frequency pass filter at 2 Hz. Fig. 4.15 shows the example of some raw (light\n\ngreen) and de-spiked (green) measurements at distinct cross-positions which shows the\n\nnoise-level differences between cross-shore positions.\n\nThe noise in the velocity measurements due to reflection of the acoustic signal in the\n\nsediment particles can be a problem when the aim is to obtain good-quality accurate\n\nvelocity measurements. However, it can also be an advantage.\n\nDuring the experiments, no instruments capable of directly measuring sediment\n\nconcentration were available. While the total sediment transport per wave condition\n\nis calculated from the changes of the bed position measured and the beachface bed\n\nposition can be inferred from the swash-zone wave gauges, the sediment suspended\n\nduring wave action cannot be measured. As it will be referred later in this chapter,\n\nit is important to track the episodes of larger sediment suspension and, especially,\n\ntheir phasing relatively to the wave groups.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nmeasurements becomes an advantage. When the water is sufficiently high to prevent\n\nthe emersion of the ADV sensor, which was always the case when it was positioned\n\noffshore of the swash zone, all the noise in the velocity measurements is directly linked\n\nto the presence of sediment in the water column at the sensor height. Hence, the ADV\n\nmeasurements can give an indication of at which cross-shore positions there is more\n\nsediment suspension, at which height from the bottom and during which interval of\n\nthe wave groups. For example, Fig. 4.15 illustrates high sediment suspension at the\n\nend of each short-wave group, at x = 21.65 m (second plot), which is the approximate\n\ncross-shore position of the bar/breakpoint at the time of the measurements. Significant\n\nsediment suspension also occurs just after breaking, at x = 22.16 m (third plot), but it\n\nis weaker.\n\nThe episodes of larger sediment suspension inferred from the velocity measurements\n\nwere also confirmed by visual observation during the experiments. The side-walls of the\n\nLEGI wave flume are made of glass, which allows the direct observation (or filming) of\n\nthe sediment suspension events during wave action, as it is shown in Fig. 4.16.\n\nFigure 4.16: Examples of sediment suspension observed in different zones of the beach profile (photos\nby Cyril Fresillon - CNRS photothe?que).\n\nSERR1D contribution\n\nThe cross-shore positions where the flow-velocity measurements are more important\n\nare those near the breakpoint and in the surf zone. This is where high sediment-transport\n\nrates are expected to occur. However, as it was discussed before, these are also the\n\npositions where velocity measurements are more difficult to obtain and more noisy. In\n\norder to overcome this limitation, the SERR1D model (described in chapter 3) can be\n\nused to obtain an estimation of the cross-shore velocity for the different wave conditions\n\nsimulated.\n\nFor all the three wave conditions, clean velocity measurements were available at x\n\n= 20.4 m, the end of the shoaling zone. Since at this position there were collocated\n\nmeasurements of free-surface elevation and velocity, the measured free-surface elevation\n\ntime series can be retrieved from the wave gauges and the reflected IG waves can be\n\nextracted from the total signal (following the method of Guza et al. (1984) described in\n\n124\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.2\n\nchapter 3). This time series is a more precise representation of the waves present in\n\nthe flume at the end of the shoaling zone (already including reflected IG waves) than\n\nthe theoretical solution that is provided at the wave-maker (which does not include\n\nreflected IG waves) and thus it is used as the input wave condition for SERR1D.\n\nThe SERR1D numerical model, as it is applied in this work, does not have a\n\nmorphodynamics module. Therefore, the bottom position is defined as constant along\n\neach run, which is not true in reality (especially near the breakpoint) and further\n\nimplies that a real bottom-friction coefficient is not constant (both in space or in time).\n\nHowever, the model does not consider a mobile bed and the friction coefficient is set,\n\nfor the simulations presented in this section, to 0.002. The values of the breaking-model\n\nparameters are the same as ones discussed in chapter 3.\n\nC2 was initially used for model validation. Fig. 4.17 shows the comparison of\n\nfree-surface elevation and velocity experimental and numerical data obtained for a\n\nmodel simulation of two wave groups of C2 wave condition and also illustrates the\n\nuncertainty related to the bed position.\n\nIn a general way, taking into account the limitations mentioned, the model is capable\n\nof representing both the free-surface elevation and the cross-shore velocity of short-waves.\n\nHowever, it underestimates IG waves, particularly in the inner-surf and swash zones.\n\nIG-waves reflected at the wave-maker are already present at the end of the second\n\nwave group for cross-shore positions close to the coast. This results in an increase of\n\nIG-wave height near the coast that the model partially reproduces.\n\nThe bed position measured at the end of each experiment is not exactly the bed\n\nposition over which the waves act, since a certain layer of the bed is put in suspension\n\nduring the runs: the real bed position during motion is found to be deeper than the\n\nposition measured by the bed profiler. This contributes to small differences between\n\nmeasured and simulated data, particularly near the breakpoint, which is a zone of great\n\nbed mobilization during the runs. These differences are illustrated in Fig. 4.17, between\n\nthe darker and lighter markers.\n\nFig. 4.18 shows the times series of model and experimental data for several cross-\n\nshore positions. As it was already stated, the model does very well in the shoaling and\n\nouter-surf zone, representing even the correct phasing of the waves along the groups.\n\nHowever, in the inner-surf and swash zones, there is an IG-wave height difference\n\nbetween numerical and experimental data (particularly at the end of the second wave\n\ngroup), which promotes shallower short-wave troughs (and thus less negative velocities)\n\nat the trough of the IG wave, for the numerical data. Nevertheless, the phasing of each\n\nwave remains very good along the beach profile, even for velocity.\n\nBesides the limitations already mentioned, there is also the difficulty in validating\n\n125\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Chapter 4.

This means that the different transport mechanisms at play start balancing\n\neach other at some point in time and the profile shape stops evolving. The time needed\n\nfor this to happen depends on how different is the initial profile from the equilibrium\n\nprofile.\n\n128\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.3\n\nFig. 4.20 depicts the equilibrium beach profiles obtained for each wave condition.\n\nAccording to Grasso et al. (2009a), the shape of the equilibrium profile depends only\n\non the Dean number and thus on significant wave height and peak period and the\n\nsediment settling velocity. However, Fig. 4.20 shows that, even though C1, C2 and C3\n\nhave the same Hs, Tp and sediment particles, the equilibrium beach-profile shape is\n\ndifferent, particularly in the shallower zones (namely, in the beachface). At first sight,\n\nfour features mark the main differences between the equilibrium profiles: the beach\n\nslope, the depth of the surf zone, the width of the emerged beach and the presence (or\n\nabsence) of a bar. C3 has shallower surf and swash zones and a larger emerged beach,\n\nwhile for C1 the shallowest zones of the beach profile have greater water depth and the\n\nsediment is instead accumulated in deeper waters, around x = 18.5 m. The C2 surf\n\nand swash zones are deeper than for C3 and shallower than for C1. The C2 equilibrium\n\nprofile is the only one with a marked bar separating the shoaling and the surf zones.\n\nFor depths greater than x = 16 m, the beach profiles are very similar for the three wave\n\nconditions.\n\nFig. 4.21 presents the wave statistics obtained for each wave condition during the\n\nequilibrium runs. The major disparity that can be observed between wave conditions is\n\nthe IG-wave height, which is especially smaller for C3 wave condition along the entire\n\nbeach profile, and smaller for C2 than for C1 around x = 21 m. Furthermore, the bar\n\n(C2) and slope break (C1 and C3) are located at a cross-shore position of minimum\n\nIG-wave height. This minimum is located at the central nodal point of the prevailing\n\nfree-surface elevation standing pattern (mode 2, as seen in Figs. 4.5 and 4.6) and is\n\nlocated slightly further offshore for C2 than C1, and even more for C3 (as predicted\n\nfor the second theoretic resonant mode of each wave condition in Fig. 4.5). Both\n\nfactors, that (i) IG-wave height is the largest difference in wave statistics between wave\n\nconditions and that (ii) an important feature of the beach profile (the bar or the slope\n\n8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0\n\nx (m)\n\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n(m\n\n)\n\nFigure 4.20: Equilibrium profiles for C1 (blue), C2 (green) and C3 (red).\n\n129\n\n\n\nSection 4.3 Chapter 4.

Even though for the\n\nthree wave conditions the measurements represented correspond to equilibrium runs,\n\nthe beachface bed position is not constant for all. For C3 the bed position measured\n\nis effectively the same along the entire run, except for very small variations of a few\n\nmillimeters. For C2, some variations of about 0.5 cm are present but tend to disappear\n\nduring the run. However, for C1, even though the mean bed position remains constant\n\n(around 2.8 cm above the mean water level, for the example of Fig. 4.22), there are\n\nperiodic variations (of up to 1 cm height) with a timescale of about 18 min (which will\n\nbe called \u201coscillations\u201d in the rest of this manuscript). As C1 is the wave condition\n\nwith the greatest IG waves, once again a link between IG-waves and the beach profile\n\nshape (in this case, the height of the beachface) is suggested.\n\nFig. 4.23 shows the evolution in time of the IG-wave height along the beach profile,\n\nfor the C1 equilibrium run whose beachface bed-position variation was presented in\n\nde top plot of Fig. 4.22. Like for the beachface bed position, an oscillation of around\n\n18 min can also be seen in the IG-wave height in different regions of the beach profile.\n\nMaxima (in time) of the bed-elevation near the shoreline (around x = 24.6 m, for C1\n\nequilibrium run) are associated to maxima (in time) of IG-wave height at the same\n\nlocations, in the surf and swash zones, and in deeper waters. The cross-shore position\n\nof the minimum of IG-wave height located around x = 22 m (and associated to the\n\n131\n\n\n\nSection 4.3 Chapter 4.

However, the beachface bed-position oscillations have a\n\nlong period of 18 min, too long for being only of the timescale of hydrodynamic forcings\n\n(which are expected to be of the order of a few minutes). Therefore, even though an\n\nimplicit link between the oscillations of the beachface bed position and the IG waves\n\nseems to exist, the IG-waves cannot be the sole responsible agent: there must exist a\n\nmorphodynamic feedback, linked to the IG-wave motion, that also plays a role in the\n\ndynamics of the oscillations.\n\nFig. 4.24 shows the sediment transport patterns of five C1 20-min runs for which\n\nthe oscillation of the beachface is particularly noteworthy. These are runs with a\n\nshorter duration than the equilibrium runs and with a beach profile still far from\n\nthe equilibrium profile, but which mimic the behaviour of the beachface during C1\n\nequilibrium. The sediment transport patterns observed highlight once more the link\n\nbetween the oscillations of the beachface and the oscillations of the surf and inner-\n\nshoaling zones, already observed in Fig. 4.23 for the IG-wave height. When the upper\n\nbeach is eroded (accreted), accretion (erosion) dominates the surf and lower swash\n\n132\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

This dynamics is associated with an onshore (offshore) sediment\n\ntransport until the mid-surf zone, and an offshore (onshore) sediment transport further\n\nup the beach. In the outer-shoaling zone and in deeper waters, sediment transport is\n\nless linked with the dynamics of the upper profile, responding to sediment transport\n\nprocesses of longer time scale.\n\nFig. 4.25 shows the IG free-surface elevation and velocity evolution along a C1\n\nequilibrium run, for a single cross-shore position located at the end of the shoaling zone\n\n(x = 21.9 m). During this long run, input wave conditions at the wave-maker remained\n\nconstant. Nonetheless, since the IG waves that are generated by the wave-maker at\n\nevery instant are added to the ones that remained in the flume since the beginning of\n\nthe run, the phase of the IG waves changes along the run. At this cross-shore position\n\n(which is close to an IG free-surface-elevation minimum), the oscillation (the periodic\n\noscillation of 18 min mentioned before) of the phase of the incident IG waves (??inc) is\n\napproximately in anti-phase to the oscillation of the reflected IG-wave phase (??ref ): as\n\n??inc increases, ??ref decreases, which results in weak oscillations of the total IG-waves\n\nphase along the run. These oscillations of the incident and reflected IG-waves phases\n\n133\n\n\n\nSection 4.3 Chapter 4.

These can be in phase or not with the oscillations of ??inc, depending on the\n\ncross-shore position considered. Since Hrms,IGinc and Hrms,IGref vary, the total IG-wave\n\nheight also varies with the same 18-min period. The signature of these oscillations is\n\npresent as well in the velocity data, particularly near velocity maxima positions (such\n\nas the cross-shore position considered in Fig. 4.25, where high velocities are expected\n\nand thus variations are more notorious). Greater IG-wave velocity is observed close\n\nto the maximal ??inc values and minima Hrms,IG. Skewness and asymmetry are also\n\naffected by the changing of the IG-wave phase.\n\nThe variation of the absolute values of all these hydrodynamic variables along the\n\nC1 equilibrium run is linked to the oscillations of the beachface previously mentioned,\n\nwhich are in turn linked to the dynamics of the entire profile. The changing of the\n\nbeachface slope and associated change in the surf-zone morphology can, in turn, be\n\ninfluencing the hydrodynamics. Slow accretion of the beachface, when IG-wave height\n\nis minimal, results in a more reflective beachface, which contributes to a more energetic\n\nswash dynamics and to greater IG-wave reflection, thus promoting IG-wave growth.\n\nThe accretion of the beachface is accompanied by an accretion just offshore of the\n\n134\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4\n\nbreakpoint and by the delineation of a better-defined bar (due to the transport of\n\nsediment from the surf zone to the beachface), which eventually shifts the location of\n\nshort-wave energy dissipation from the lower beachface to the surf zone. This results\n\nin a less energetic swash zone and a less reflective beachface, which promotes IG-wave\n\nheight decrease. When an IG-wave minimum height is reached, the slow accretion of\n\nthe beachface can start again and so on.\n\nSince several mechanisms are constantly at play along the beach profiles, a static\n\nequilibrium (for which the beach profile remains always at the same position) is hard\n\nto attain, particularly if one or more mechanisms are periodically enhanced. Instead, a\n\ndynamic equilibrium is more likely, with multiple slightly-different profiles oscillating\n\naround a certain profile shape. In the flume, the oscillations of the beach profile around\n\nan equilibrium shape are enhanced by the presence of the \u201ctrapped\u201d IG waves that\n\nreflect at the beach and re-reflect at the wave-maker, generating standing modes that\n\nare only dissipated after the end of each run. This effect is particularly important for\n\nC1, since it has greater IG waves.\n\nThe equilibrium profiles reached by several long runs of C1, C2 or C3 wave conditions\n\nare not the same that would be attained if only a few short-wave groups were run with\n\nthe same wave conditions, run by run, until equilibrium, since long runs allow steady\n\nIG standing-wave patterns to establish and be enhanced, contrary to very-short runs.\n\n4.4 Beach response to wave groups\n\nThe multiple feedbacks between the hydrodynamics and the morphology make it\n\ndifficult to further dissect the dynamics of the oscillations observed during the long\n\nequilibrium runs. Therefore, two wave-group runs were conceived to allow the analysis\n\nof the effect of each wave condition on the beach profile without the influence of IG\n\nwaves artificially added and enhanced by re-reflection at the wave-maker. This results\n\nin a more realistic approach since, in nature, waves can be reflected at the beach but\n\nthey will then propagate towards deep waters and will not be re-reflected back.\n\nDuring each short run only two wave groups were ran (27.2 s). In this case, the IG\n\nwaves re-reflected at the wave-maker will only arrive at each cross-shore position at the\n\nend of the second short-wave group. However, IG waves produced by the first wave\n\ngroup that reflect at the beach will influence the second wave group.\n\nFig. 4.26 shows the propagation, both in time and in space, of the two wave groups\n\nand the IG waves associated, for each of the three wave conditions. The beach profiles\n\nduring the three runs, represented in Fig. 4.27, were very similar (except for a deeper\n\ntrough around x = 22 m, for C3 run initial profile), therefore the differences observed\n\n135\n\n\n\nSection 4.4 Chapter 4.

The IG-wave period is also the same,\n\nit is the IG-wave height and phasing that change. The following analysis aims at\n\nunderstanding what is the importance of these two parameters of IG waves on the\n\noverall hydrodynamics and morphodynamics along the beach profile and what are the\n\nmechanisms behind a distinct morphological behavior for each wave condition. For\n\nthat purpose, short runs of two wave groups, run over three different types of initial\n\nbeach profiles, are presented. The differences in the morphodynamics between wave\n\nconditions are highlighted and an analysis of the hydrodynamics is subsequently done to\n\ntry to identify the mechanisms behind these differences.

This implies\n\nthat C1, C2 and C3 were not always run over the same initial profile. They were run\n\nover different profiles, similar until about x = 20 m and with greater differences from\n\nthe end of the shoaling zone until the upper beachface. The initial beach profiles can\n\nschematically be divided into three types, depicted in Fig.4.28: one with slightly more\n\ndissipative surf and swash zones and a smooth slope break between the surf and the\n\nshoaling zones (type A); one with a more defined bar just before x = 22 m, deeper\n\nsurf and swash zones and steeper surf-zone beach slope (type B); and one with no bar\n\nand almost no slope break, a significantly more shallow beachface and a wider emersed\n\nbeach (type C). This last one was only obtained when a C3 long run was run, which\n\nwas done once in the full set of experiments.\n\nAll three types of profiles are very similar until around x = 20 m. The breakpoint is\n\nlocated near x = 22 m for the three wave conditions. Contrary to profiles of type B,\n\nprofiles of type A and C have no marked bar near the breakpoint and have shallower surf\n\nand swash zones. Type C profiles have the shallowest surf and swash zones (about 4-cm\n\nand 2-cm shallower than for profiles of type B and A, respectively), which implies that\n\nthe shoreline is positioned further offshore, about 1 m from type-B-profiles shoreline and\n\n0.5 m from type-A-profiles shoreline. All profile types produced during the experiments\n\nhave a mean beach slope typical of intermediate beaches in nature.\n\n8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nx (m)\n\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n(m\n\n)\n\nType A\n\nType B\n\nType C\n\nFigure 4.28: Beach profiles representative of types A, B and C.\n\n4.4.1 Morphodynamics\n\nDepending on the initial profile, the sediment transport induced by each wave\n\ncondition can be different.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nbed profile (eroding, accreting, . . . ) allows an understanding of its sediment transport\n\npotential.\n\nSince in this section of the work the focus is on the two wave-groups runs, the analysis\n\nof sediment transport is done for the upper section of the profile (onshore of x = 20 m),\n\nas the small duration of these runs was not enough to induce significant change in the\n\ndeeper parts of the profile. Fig. 4.29 shows the effect of three C2 short runs over initial\n\nbeach profiles of type C (with the shallowest surf and swash zones), type A (with surf\n\nand swash zones deeper than type C) and type B (with the deepest surf and swash\n\nzones).\n\nFor initial profiles of type C and A, C2 promotes erosion of the surf and swash\n\nzones, concomitant with an offshore transport that then results in accumulation in\n\nthe upper-shoaling zone. Acting over the shallower surf zone and beachface of type C\n\nprofile, the maximum magnitude of the offshore transport promoted by C2 diminishes\n\nby only around 25% from the first to the last run.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4\n\nthe initial profile is of type B, C2 is even less capable of offshore transport, showing\n\nvery low rates of transport, and the first run even has an accreting action near the\n\nbreakpoint.\n\nC1 is the wave condition with more IG waves at the upper beach, and a different\n\nIG-wave phasing relative to the group. Fig. 4.30 illustrates how C1 acts on initial beach\n\nprofiles of types A and B. As C2, C1 promotes erosion in the surf zone with offshore\n\ntransport towards the shoaling zone, for initial profiles of type A. However, erosion is\n\nmore intense just after the breakpoint (instead of being more gentle but over the entire\n\nsurf and swash zones) and the magnitude of the maximum offshore transport does not\n\nweaken significantly along the three runs. Furthermore, for C1 runs, the sediment that\n\nis deposited in the shoaling zone, is deposited at a location further offshore than for C2.\n\nFor the type-B initial profile, while C2 no longer promotes a marked offshore transport,\n\nC1 is still capable of doing so, continuing to erode the trough after the breakpoint,\n\naccentuating the bar. The sediment eroded keeps being transported offshore as for\n\nC1-over-type-A case, and deposited between x = 20.5 m and x = 22 m.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nclear that C1 still promotes the pattern of sediment erosion after the breakpoint and\n\ndeposition in the end of the shoaling zone for profiles for which C2 is no longer capable.\n\nNo results are presented for the type-C beach profile for C1 wave condition. However,\n\nit is logic to assume, from the results depicted in Fig. 4.29, that if C1 was ran over a\n\ntype-C initial profile, the tendency would be for sediment transport to follow the same\n\ntransport pattern that it does for C2, but with even greater magnitude.\n\nThe C3 wave condition, with less modulation, shows less capacity for transporting\n\nsediment, when compared with C2 and C1. Fig. 4.31 shows the effect of two and three\n\nshort runs, over profiles of type A and B, respectively. Over profiles of type A, only\n\ntwo runs are enough to show that C3 essentially smooths the initial profile, with no\n\nmajor zones of accretion or erosion. For type-B initial profiles, C3 results in a transport\n\ntendency with an opposite direction to that of C1. While C1 tends to promote the\n\nerosion of the through inshore of the bar, C3 promotes accretion instead. The sediment\n\naccumulating just inshore of x = 22 m is transported onshore from the region between\n\nx = 20 m and x = 22 m, which is the same region where sediment transported by C1\n\nfrom inshore of the bar accumulates.\n\n?0.3\n\n?0.2\n\n?0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\nE\nle\n\nv\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\n)\n\nType A\n\n?3\n?2\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n?\nh\ns\n/\n?\nt\n\n(m\nh\n-1\n\n)\n\n20 21 22 23 24 25\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\u00b710?3\n\nx (m)\n\nq\ns\n\n(m\n2\n)\n\nType B\n\n20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nx (m)\n\nFigure 4.31: Beach profiles, variation of sediment height and bulk sediment transport for groups of\ntwo and three C3 short runs, run over initial beach profiles of types A and B, respectively.

However, the capacity for promoting sediment\n\ntransport over one same profile type along two or three runs is meaningful and can be\n\ncompared between wave conditions.\n\nEven though the magnitudes may diverge depending on the initial profile type\n\nconsidered and other morphological characteristics of the profiles (such as ripples), a\n\ncommon pattern of sediment transport was found for each wave condition. Summing\n\nup, at the time scale of two to three runs of two wave groups each:\n\n? for all conditions, sediment is transported from (to) the region of the shoaling\n\nzone comprised between x = 20 m and x = 22 m, to (from) the surf zone, in\n\nparticular the outer-surf zone; this means that these two zones of the beach profile\n\nare morphodynamically coupled;\n\n? for C1 and C2, the general tendency of transport between the shoaling and the\n\nsurf zones is offshore-directed, while for C3 is onshore-directed;\n\n? C1 has a greater capacity for eroding the trough after the bar and transporting\n\nsediment offshore than C2;\n\n? C3 is the only condition promoting sediment accretion in the inner-surf zone over\n\nthe profile type considered;\n\n? C1 and C2 (higher IG waves) tend to develop a bar/trough near the breaking zone,\n\nwhile the onshore sediment transport promoted by C3 promotes the disappearance\n\nof the bar/trough system;\n\n? the morphodynamic changes observed are greater for the wave conditions further\n\napart from their equilibrium profiles.\n\n4.4.2 Hydrodynamics\n\nSediment transport patterns and beach-profile morphology changes were shown to\n\nbe different for each wave condition. In order to understand the mechanisms behind\n\nthese differences, the wave hydrodynamics are subsequently analysed through means of\n\nHrms of both total and IG-wave only, Sk, As, ??? and ???. The residual oscillations that\nremain in the flume after the passage of the two wave groups are not to be included\n\nin the statistics as they may bias the results and therefore a method based on the\n\n141\n\n\n\nSection 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nwave-group envelope width was used to select the part of the free-surface elevation\n\nsignal to be considered. An example for each of the wave conditions is depicted in Fig.\n\n4.32. The resulting time series do not have the same length for all the wave gauges and,\n\nin the case of the most offshore gauges, a limit of 27.2 s was imposed as the maximum\n\nduration of the time series to include. Considering the wave-envelope duration allows\n\nthe inclusion of important short-waves at the end of the IG wave, for gauges in the surf\n\nzone. If only the length of the two wave groups, as they were input at the wave-maker\n\n(27.2 s), was considered for these gauges, an important part of the wave amplitude signal\n\nwould be ignored in the statistics. This method, applied to establish the duration of\n\nthe free-surface-elevation signal to be considered, is thus a compromise for the different\n\ncross-shore positions and wave conditions. Small differences in the statistics that may\n\nbe found for the most offshore wave gauges (for which short-wave height is the same for\n\nall wave conditions) are linked to small variations in the selected part of the time series.\n\nSince the hydrodynamics depends not only on the wave condition but also on\n\nthe beach profile over which it acts, in order to understand the differences between\n\nwave conditions, the beach profiles must be the most similar possible. Therefore, the\n\nhydrodynamics are analysed in pairs of runs (C2-C1, C2-C3 and C1-C3), between which\n\nvery little bed-profile changes were observed. This analysis is presented in Fig.4.33.\n\nFrom the comparison of the free-surface elevation statistics between wave conditions,\n\nsome observations can be summed up:\n\n? As expected, short-wave height is about the same for all wave conditions until\n\nthe end of the shoaling zone and very similar beyond;\n\nC3\n\n0 20 40 60\n\nt (s)\n\n?0.08\n\n?0.04\n\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n?\n(m\n\n)\n\nx\n=\n\n9\nm\n\nC1\n\n0 20 40 60\n?0.03\n\n0\n\n0.03\n\n0.06\n\nt (s)\n\n?\n(m\n\n)\n\nx\n=\n\n2\n2\n.6\n6\nm\n\nC2\n\n0 20 40 60\n\nt (s)\n\nFigure 4.32: Example of selected time series (thicker and lighter-coloured part of the curves) from\nwave gauge data, for C1, C2 and C3, at two different cross-shore positions (top and bottom).\n\n142\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\n? Nonlinearities increase in the shoaling zone until the breaking zone and decrease\n\nin the surf zone;\n\n? As? in the surf and swash zones is greater for the conditions with less IG waves,\n\nin particular for C3;\n\n? Sk?, dissipation and set-up/set-down are very similar between conditions.\n\nThe differences in sediment transport between wave conditions have to be justified\n\nby a distinct balance between the hydrodynamic processes for each wave condition. In\n\nthis case, the main parameters that vary significantly between the three wave conditions\n\nare the IG-wave height and the asymmetry.\n\nOn the one hand, asymmetry is known to contribute to onshore sediment transport.\n\nA greater asymmetry is observed for C3 (comparatively to the other conditions) shore-\n\nwards of x = 22 m, which may contribute to an onshore-transport tendency in the surf\n\nzone. On the other hand, the IG-wave height is the only parameter shown in Fig. 4.33\n\nthat is different for the three wave conditions in the shoaling and surf zones and may\n\nthus help justifying the sediment transport between these zones of the beach profile.\n\nAnother mechanism that could justify the offshore sediment transport observed for\n\ncertain experiments and has not been discussed yet is the phase-lag effect. Positive\n\nwave skewness is generally associated with net onshore sediment transport. However,\n\nwaves that are purely skewed may generate a net sediment transport offshore directed\n\ndue to the phase lag between the mobilization and the transport of the sediment. This\n\nmechanism can be characterized by a phase-lag parameter (Dohmen-Janssen et al.,\n\n2002), which essentially depends on two variables: the particle settling time and the\n\nwave period. Grasso et al. (2011) have investigated the occurrence of phase-lag effects\n\nin the LEGI wave flume under wave conditions with similar heights and periods to the\n\nones analysed herein and have shown that, effectively, for most of their experiments,\n\nunsteady behavior was observed, during which phase-lag effects can occur. However,\n\nin their case, these effects were observed when large wave skewness was associated\n\nto small wave asymmetry, which is not frequent in the experiments analysed in this\n\nwork. Furthermore, for all the three conditions, C1, C2 and C3, the particle settling\n\ntime (settling velocity) and the short-wave period are the same. Therefore, at the\n\ntimescale of short waves, the phase-lags effects can be expected to be of the same\n\norder independently of the wave condition considered. Hence, phase-lag effects linked\n\nto short-wave-action only cannot be responsible for the differences observed in the\n\nsediment transport between wave conditions.\n\nAnalysing the velocity measurements for the different wave conditions may provide\n\nfurther insight into the differences observed in the sediment transport. Velocity measure-\n\n144\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4\n\nments were done during the experiments at various cross-shore positions. Nonetheless,\n\nas it was depicted in Fig. 4.15, it was not possible to obtain good velocity measurements\n\nwith the ADV along all the profile. In particular, the region where the greatest undertow\n\nis expected (near breaking), is particularly difficult for getting clean measurements, as\n\nthere are large amounts of sediment in suspension. Since the undertow may promote an\n\nimportant offshore sediment transport, it is crucial to evaluate its contribution for the\n\ndifferent wave conditions. To overcome the lack of accurate ADV velocity measurements\n\nnear the breakpoint and in the surf zone, the SERR1D model was used to simulate the\n\nC1, C2 and C3 short runs, providing velocity predictions for all wave-gauge positions.\n\nFig. 4.34 depicts the comparison of the cross-shore variation of velocity for C2 and C1\n\n?0.2\n\n?0.1\n\n0\n\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n(m\n\n)\n\nC1-C2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nu\nr\nm\ns\n(m\n\ns-\n1\n)\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\nu\nr\nm\ns\n,I\nG\n\n(m\ns-\n1\n)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nS\nk\nu\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\nA\ns\nu\n\n20 21 22 23 24 25\n?0.08\n?0.06\n?0.04\n?0.02\n\n0\n\nx (m)\n\n<\nu\n>\n\n(m\ns-\n1\n)\n\nC2-C3\n\n20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nx (m)\n\nFigure 4.34: Left column: comparison of velocity statistics for C2 (circles), C1 (asterisks).

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\n(left column) and for C2 and C3 (right column), obtained with SERR1D. For the first\n\npoint of the domain, the velocity experimental values are also depicted in Fig. 4.34.\n\nFor each pair of wave conditions, the experimental runs chosen for providing the input\n\nconditions had been run one after the other and thus over beach profiles almost equal.\n\nThe estimated urms is nearly the same for the three wave conditions and is maximal\n\nnear the breakpoint (and thus near the bar/slope-break). The urms,IG also reaches its\n\nmaximum near the breakpoint for all wave conditions, but it is greater for C1 and\n\nsmaller for C3, responding to the different IG-wave heights. Between C2 and C3 this\n\ndifference is only significant after the breakpoint. Although the trends are very similar\n\nfor the three wave conditions, Sku tends to be greater for C2, until the surf zone. As\n\nit was already observed for As?, the Asu is larger when IG-waves are smaller. The\n\nundertow increases until the breakpoint (near the bar), decreasing afterwards towards\n\nthe beach, being very similar for all wave conditions. This was further confirmed by\n\nvelocity profiles done with an ADVP, although these results are not presented nor\n\nanalysed in the scope of this thesis. Moreover, the wave conditions which tend to\n\npromote offshore transport from the surf zone towards deeper waters are not the ones\n\nwith slightly greater undertow velocities. Therefore, as a first hypothesis, the undertow\n\nis not the preponderant driving mechanism for the offshore sediment transport.\n\nStill in pursuance of a better understanding of the differences in the flow velocity\n\nbetween wave conditions that can contribute to the differences observed in the morpho-\n\ndynamics, Fig. 4.35 shows the comparison of five terms resulting from the decomposition\n\nof the third-order velocity moment\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nfor C1-C2 and C2-C3 pairs, from the end\n\nof shoaling until the shore (calculated following the procedure detailed in chapter 3).\n\nThe other terms that are not presented have a negligible contribution (at least one\n\norder of magnitude smaller than the terms presented). Positive/negative values of\n\nthe third-order velocity moment terms are expected to contribute to onshore/offshore\n\ntransport.\n\nAmong the terms considered, it is the short-wave skewness (Sk1), the correlation\n\nbetween short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity (Sk2) and the short-wave stirring\n\nand transport by the mean flow that dominate for all wave conditions. For C1, C2 and\n\nC3, with the exception of Sk1 terms, all the terms have negative values, thus potentially\n\ncontributing to an offshore transport. For both C1 and C2, until the breakpoint, Sk1\n\nand Sk2 have values of the same order of magnitude, but of opposite sign. For C1, Sk1\n\nis slightly smaller than for C2 and than Sk2. For C2, it is Sk2 which is slightly smaller\n\nthan Sk1 and smaller than for C1. If only these terms are considered, a slight tendency\n\nfor more offshore transport may thus be expected for C1. If the analysis is extended\n\nto the other three terms (Sk4, Sk5 and Sk6), except for the stirring by short-waves\n\n146\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Each pair of wave conditions was simulation over the same beach profile: in the left\ncolumn, C1 (blue asterisks) and C2 (green circles); in the right column, C2 and C3 (red crosses).\n\nand transport by mean flow (Sk5), the tendency is for C1 to have more negative values\n\nthan C2, reinforcing the contribution to offshore transport. In the inner-surf and swash\n\nzones, for C1, the values of Sk2, Sk4 and Sk5 are progressively less negative than for\n\nC2, and significantly less negative than near the breakpoint, even changing to a positive\n\ncontribution (Sk4) near the shoreline. Therefore, the potential for offshore transport\n\nassociated with\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nterms for C1 seems higher than for C2 until the breakpoint,\n\nbut decreases in the surf and swash zones, where the potential for offshore transport is\n\ngreater for C2.\n\nFor C3, the distinct terms of\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nare very similar to those of C2 until the\n\nbreakpoint: Sk1 is greater for C2, but is almost compensated by Sk2, which is slightly\n\n147\n\n\n\nSection 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\ngreater for C2 as well, and the other terms are equal and negative for both C2 and C3.\n\nOnshore of the breakpoint, the differences between C2 and C3 for Sk1, Sk2 and Sk5\n\nterms are very small, and it is the terms linked to IG waves (Sk4 and Sk6) that are\n\ndistinct between the two wave conditions: since for C3 the IG waves are very small, the\n\ncontribution of these terms are small in this zone of the beach profile.\n\nThe analysis of the third-order velocity moment terms can be summed up in the\n\nfollowing points:\n\n? For the three wave conditions, there are more terms contributing to an offshore\n\nthan to an onshore transport direction; however, the absolute values of each term\n\nvary between conditions;\n\n? C1 and C2 have very similar contributions of the different terms to sediment\n\ntransport, with C1 having a slightly greater contribution from terms directly\n\ndependent on IG-wave motion and C2 from terms more dependent on short-wave\n\nmotion;\n\n? Short-wave skewness is smaller for C3 than for the other two wave conditions\n\nbefore the breakpoint;\n\n? The terms directly dependent on IG-wave velocity are particularly small for C3\n\nonshore of the breakpoint.\n\nOnshore of the breakpoint it is clear the smaller contribution of the\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nterms\n\nresponsible for offshore transport (Sk2-Sk6) for C3 than for C2. However, near the\n\nbreakpoint and further offshore, no clear inequality of the former terms is observed\n\nbetween the wave conditions. Furthermore, also before the breakpoint, the values of\n\nthe various terms for C1 and C2 seem too similar to justify the significantly-greater\n\ncapacity for accumulating sediment until x = 20.5 m previously observed for C1 (Fig.\n\n4.30). Therefore, some other mechanism must be determining the differences in the\n\nsediment transport observed around the breakpoint and further offshore.\n\nFor all wave conditions, the short-wave velocity reaches its largest values in the\n\nbreaking zone (around x = 22 m), which means that great quantities of sediment are\n\nsuspended there by short-wave action. In the same zone of the beach profile, IG waves\n\nalso reach maximal velocities, which means that they may advect the sediment stirred\n\nby short-wave action away from its initial location.\n\nFor IG waves to be able of transporting sediment suspended by the short waves, not\n\nonly the magnitude of IG-wave velocity is important, but also the phasing between the\n\nIG waves and the short waves. Very small differences in the IG-wave velocity magnitude\n\nbetween conditions are depicted in Fig. 4.34 (especially between C2 and C3), which\n\n148\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4\n\nsupports the idea that the phasing between the IG waves and the short waves may even\n\nbe fundamental.\n\nFig. 4.36 shows, for experimental and numerical data, the time series of free-surface\n\nelevation and velocity, for the total signal and IG-component only and the separation of\n\nthe incident and reflected IG-wave components. The time series are presented for three\n\nexample cases of C1, C2 and C3, run over very similar profiles (those of Fig. 4.33). The\n\nincident IG waves are very-accurately represented by the model for all wave conditions,\n\nboth in terms of amplitude and phasing. The phasing of the reflected IG waves depends\n\nstrongly on the beach-profile shape (shoreline position, water depth, etc.) and swash\n\nzone dynamics, which hinders the model from achieving a totally correct representation\n\nof this component of the IG waves. Fig. 4.36 also confirms the ability of the model to\n\napproximately simulate the IG waves, particularly in terms of amplitude, for incident,\n\nreflected and total IG waves.\n\nFor all the conditions, IG velocities are predominantly negative along the cycle, which\n\nis also observed for cross-shore positions further inshore. The onshore-directed IG-wave\n\nvelocities are not only shorter in time and smaller in magnitude, but they are also\n\nconcurrent with the smallest short waves of the groups. This means that more sediment\n\nis expected to be in suspension (and thus available to be advected by the IG waves)\n\n?0.04\n\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n?\n(m\n\n)\n\nC2\n\n?0.4\n?0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nu\n(m\n\ns-\n1\n)\n\n0 10 20 30\n?0.02\n\n?0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\nt (s)\n\n?\nI\nG\n\n(m\n)\n\nC1\n\n0 10 20 30\n\nt (s)\n\nC3\n\n?e\n?e,IG\nAe\n?n\n?n,IG\nAn\n\nue\nue,IG\nun\nun,IG\n\n0 10 20 30\n\nt (s)\n\n?e,IG\n?e,IGi\n?e,IGr\n?n,IG\n?n,IGi\n?n,IGr\n\nFigure 4.36: Free-surface elevation (total and IG), cross-shore velocity (total and IG) and IG-wave\ntotal, incident and reflected components for C2, C1 and C3 example runs (shown in Fig. 4.33), at x =\n20.4 m, for experimental and numerical data.\n\n149\n\n\n\nSection 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nduring the offshore stroke of the IG waves. Hence, an offshore sediment transport by\n\nthe IG-wave oscillatory flow seems more likely than an onshore sediment transport. For\n\nthe runs represented in Fig. 4.36 (the same runs of Fig. 4.33), C1 has greater IG-wave\n\nheight and thus greater IG-wave velocity (urms,IG = 0.036 m s\n-1, instead of urms,IG =\n\n0.026 m s-1 for C2, at x = 20.4 m). Also, the IG negative velocities reach their maxima\n\nnear the end of the wave groups when the largest amount of sediment was observed to\n\nbe in suspension. Both factors justify the greater capacity for sediment transport in the\n\noffshore direction of C1 relatively to C2, which was also suggested by the third-order\n\nvelocity moment terms (in particular, Sk2).\n\nFor the runs considered, C3 has a urms,IG = 0.033 m s\n-1 (at x = 20.4 m - Fig. 4.36\n\nrun), between the urms values of C1 and C2. Depending, on the runs considered, the\n\nurms,IG of C3 may be more similar to that of C2 than of C1 (for e.g., in Fig. 4.34, C2\n\nand C3 urms,IG at x = 20.4 m is about the same). However, the duration of the episodes\n\nwith significant IG-wave velocity is much shorter than for C2 and, especially, than for\n\nC1 (and limited to the beginning and end of the wave signal), which results in very weak\n\nIG-wave velocities along most of the IG-wave cycle. Furthermore, unlike C1 and C2, C3\n\nshort-wave height is important even when IG-wave velocity is the smallest. Thus, for\n\nC1 and C2, the very small short waves that correspond to the IG-wave velocity minima\n\ncan be expected to suspend less sediment than the corresponding short waves of C3,\n\nwhich have comparable heights during the IG-velocity minima and along the rest of\n\nthe wave group. When there is a significant amount of sediment suspension and the\n\nIG-wave velocity is negligible and not strong enough to advect sediment offshore, it is\n\nlogical to assume that the sediment transport has to be driven by a different mechanism.\n\nC3 was seen to have the capacity for onshore transport for the same profile types over\n\nwhich C1 and C2 induced offshore transport. The C3 sediment transport must thus\n\nbe dominated by the nonlinearities of short-waves, the only mechanism that, in the\n\nabsence of significant IG-wave velocities, can promote onshore sediment transport.\n\nThe ideas explained above are based on the observation of the time series at x =\n\n20.4 m, near the outer limit of the deposition zone observed in the beach profiles. Since\n\nno clean experimental velocity measurements can be retrieved near the breakpoint, the\n\nnumerical results equivalent to Fig. 4.36, but obtained instead at x = 21.65 m, are\n\npresented in Fig. 4.37. The phasing between IG-waves (and IG-wave velocity) and\n\nshort-waves that was discussed for the results obtained at x = 20.4 m can also be\n\nobserved for the numerical data near the breakpoint (x = 21.65 m), which reinforces the\n\nidea that this phasing may be a crucial mechanism, determining the distinct sediment\n\ntransport patterns observed for each wave condition.\n\nOverall, IG-wave amplitude and phasing relatively to the wave group are shown to\n\n150\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Furthermore, IG\n\nwaves are seen to influence short-wave nonlinearities, particularly asymmetry.\n\nThe comparison between wave statistics (Fig. 4.33) for the three wave conditions\n\nhas shown that the more IG-waves are present, the smaller is the asymmetry in the\n\nsurf and swash zones. This was especially clear for C3 condition (significantly less IG\n\nwaves, the greatest asymmetry), both in terms of free-surface elevation and velocity,\n\nand contributed to onshore sediment transport. Additionally, when SERR1D was used,\n\nit partially underestimated the measured IG-wave height in the surf and swash zones\n\n(see Figs. 4.17 and 4.19. As a result, the model systematically overestimated asymmetry\n\n(and also skewness, in a smaller measure) in these zones of the beach profile. Both\n\nthese points indicate that surf- and swash-zone asymmetry is being influenced by the\n\nIG-wave height.\n\nElgar &amp; Guza (1985) have stated that contributions from the frequency pairs with low-\n\nfrequency components is opposite in sign to the contributions from the high-frequency\n\npairs, which can reduce the skewness by 30-60% and asymmetry by about 15-30%.\n\nHowever, taking as an example the cross-shore position in the surf zone of x = 23.33 m\n\nand the cases of C1 and C3 shown in Fig. 4.33, a much more accentuated reduction of\n\nasymmetry (of more than 30 %) from C3 to C1 is evident and therefore the contribution\n\n151\n\n\n\nSection 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nof the low-frequency pairs can be one of the causes, but not the main cause of asymmetry\n\nreduction. On the other hand, at the same position, the water depth is of about 3.6\n\ncm, at rest. With the set-up, 4 or 7 mm more of water depth can be expected for C1\n\nor C3, respectively, which are small values relatively to the total water depth at rest.\n\nWhile Hrms of the short waves is about the same for both C1 and C3 at that cross-shore\n\nposition, the Hrms of IG waves is about three times higher for C3, meaning that instead\n\nof a water depth of about 3.6 cm (at rest) \u00b1 0.7 cm (corresponding to half of Hrms,IG),\nfor C3, there will be a water depth of around 3.6 cm (at rest) \u00b1 1.9 cm, for C1. Hence,\nas wave nonlinearities are dependent on the local water depth, differences in the wave\n\nshape, including asymmetry, can be expected as a result of water-depth modulation by\n\nthe IG waves. This explains the differences in asymmetry found in the surf and swash\n\nzones between wave conditions.\n\n4.4.3 Monochromatic infragravity-wave runs\n\nIn nature, IG waves that propagate to the shore are most commonly associated with\n\nshort waves and thus their direct effect cannot be measured. However, in an artificial\n\nwave flume, IG waves can be simulated alone, as monochromatic waves with a long\n\nperiod.\n\n?0.3\n?0.2\n?0.1\n\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n\nE\nle\n\nv\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\n)\n\n?0.3\n?0.2\n?0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n?\nh\ns\n/\n?\nt\n\n(m\nh\n-1\n\n)\n\n15 17 19 21 23 25\n?0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\nx (m)\n\nq\ns\n\n(m\n2\n)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\nx (m)\n\nH\nr\nm\ns\n(m\n\n)\n\nIG1\n\nIG2\n\nIG3\n\nIG4\n\nFigure 4.38: Beach profiles, variation of sediment height, bulk sediment transport and Hrms for IG1,\nIG2, IG3 and IG4 experiments.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4\n\nFour 20-min IG-waves experiments were ran in the LEGI wave flume, with increasing\n\ninput IG-wave heights, presented in Fig. 4.38: IG1, with IG-wave height approximately\n\nequal to the maximum IG-wave height of C2 long runs, and IG2, IG3 and IG4, which\n\nwere designed to have wave heights twice, three times and four times the wave height\n\nof IG1 waves. For IG1, IG2 and IG3, sediment transport is very weak and the changes\n\ninduced on the beach profile consist essentially in some ripples. IG4 has significantly\n\ngreater capacity for mobilizing the sediments, promoting onshore sediment transport\n\nfrom just before the slope break towards the beachface. The effect of the monochromatic\n\nIG waves is only significant in shallower waters, at the velocity anti-node (around x =\n\n22 m).\n\nFig. 4.39 shows the comparison of IG-wave short runs (27.2 s) with C1 and C2 short\n\nruns, ran over very similar beach profiles and makes it possible to directly compare the\n\neffect on sediment transport of IG waves alone and short-waves and IG waves together.\n\nThe net sediment transport of one short run of IG1 plus one short run of IG2\n\n?0.3\n\n?0.2\n\n?0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\nE\nle\n\nv\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\n)\n\nC1\n\nIG1+IG2\n\nC2\n\n?1.5\n?1\n\n?0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n?\nh\ns\n/\n?\nt\n\n(m\nh\n-1\n\n)\n\n20 21 22 23 24 25 26\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\u00b710?3\n\nx (m)\n\nq\ns\n\n(m\n2\n)\n\nIG3\n\nC2\n\nC1\n\n20 21 22 23 24 25 26\n\nx (m)\n\nFigure 4.39: Comparison of beach profiles, variation of sediment height and bulk sediment transport\nfor C1, C2, IG1, IG2 and IG3 short runs run over similar profiles.

The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nis almost one order of magnitude smaller than that of one C2 or one C1 run. IG3\n\nhas a greater capacity for sediment transport than IG1 and IG2, but still very locally\n\n(near the shoreline). Therefore, IG waves are capable, depending on their height, of\n\ngenerating sediment transport alone, even if only very locally, but only when their height\n\nis significantly greater than the height of the IG waves associated to the short-wave\n\ngroups in the experiments presented in this work (the case of IG4 wave condition).\n\n4.5 Discussion\n\nIn this chapter, infragravity waves were shown to influence sediment transport in\n\nmany ways. In nature, IG waves that propagate to the shore are associated with short\n\nwaves and thus their direct effect cannot be measured directly.\n\nBeach &amp; Sternberg (1988) and Russell (1993) have suggested that IG waves are able\n\nof suspending sediment themselves, close to the shore, during storm conditions, when\n\nthey assume the form of swash bores. The research community has been so far inclined\n\nto think that, in a general way, IG-waves are not capable of suspending sediment alone\n\nand act instead as mean currents, advecting sediment already suspended by short-wave\n\naction (Aagaard &amp; Greenwood, 2008).\n\nFor the current work, beach profiles are classified as being in the intermediate range,\n\nmild to intermediate wave conditions are considered (with IG-wave height corresponding\n\nto less than 0.5 m in nature) and C1 and C2 were already designed to have the maximum\n\nmodulation. Even if for C1 there is the added contribution of free IG waves, Fig. 4.38\n\nshows clearly that no significant sediment transport can occur in the experiments\n\nconsidered in this work by the effect of the IG waves alone. Therefore, for the full set\n\nof experiments ran, IG waves were only capable of influencing sediment transport by\n\nadvecting the sediment suspended by the short-wave action away from its suspension\n\nzone.\n\nA turbidity current, represented in Fig. 4.40, was observed transporting from the\n\nbreaker zone significant quantities of sediment in suspension towards deeper waters.\n\nThis current started developing near the breakpoint, just after the passing of the greatest\n\nFigure 4.40: Propagation of the turbidity current towards deeper waters (photos by Cyril Fresillon -\nCNRS photothe?que).\n\n154\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.5\n\nwave of the first wave group (of each pair of wave groups), which coincided with the\n\nbeginning of the offshore stroke of the IG-wave associated with the short-wave groups.\n\nThe turbidity current then propagated offshore transporting great amounts of sediment,\n\nboth as bed-load and suspended-load, until the arrival of the next wave group, which\n\ncontributed to slow it down. However, even with a smaller velocity, it continued moving\n\nthe sediment particles slowly offshorewards until around x = 20.6 m. This current was\n\nobserved to be more intense during C1 equilibrium runs, than for C2 or C3, which leads\n\nto the consideration that IG waves may be, at least partially, influencing/controlling\n\nthis current.\n\nAagaard &amp; Greenwood (2008) have stated that if the sand is entrained near a re-\n\nsuspension maximum (such as the breakpoint, located slightly onshore of x = 22 m,\n\nfor C1 equilibrium profile), its decay distance depends only on the IG-wave orbital\n\ndiameter, which can be estimated as d0 = umaxTIG/? (where d0 is the IG-wave orbital\n\ndiameter, umax the maximum IG-wave velocity and TIG the IG-wave period). Hence,\n\nfor C1, which reaches maximum IG-wave velocities of about 0.15 m s-1 (at x = 21.9 m)\n\nfor the moments of the run with higher IG waves, an orbital diameter around 0.5 m can\n\nbe estimated. The same authors proposed that offshore of a re-suspension maximum\n\nthe transport by IG waves is directed seawards. Therefore, the offshore stroke of the IG\n\nwaves (associated with the undertow) is likely contributing to the offshore advection of\n\nsediment suspended at the breakpoint (until around x = 21.9 ? 0.5 = 21.4 m) towards\nthe offshore slope of the bar (instead of the sediment being simply re-deposited closer to\n\nthe position where it was suspended, still on the onshore side of the bar). From thereon,\n\nthe turbidity current becomes preponderant on the offshore advection of sediment,\n\ncarrying the sediment still further offshore and thus strongly influencing the sediment\n\ntransport. Fig. 4.41 shows five C1 short-runs that were run consecutively and reinforces\n\nthis idea. For this set of runs, the role of the turbidity current in the transport of\n\nsediment from the breakpoint offshorewards is very clear. In the bed profiles it is\n\nvisible, run after run, a marked accretion until about x = 20.7 m. The sediment that\n\nis transported offshore is eroded at the breakpoint, creating a trough and defining\n\nprogressively a bar.\n\nDuring the equilibrium runs, the IG waves were shown to modulate skewness and\n\nasymmetry of short-waves along the beach profile, which vary along the runs responding\n\nto the variation of IG-wave phase and height. Prel et al. (2011) had previously\n\ndemonstrated in experiments performed in the LEGI wave flume that IG waves can\n\nmodulate skewness and asymmetry even in the shoaling zone. The short-runs have\n\nshown that the phasing of IG waves relatively to the short-wave envelope can even\n\ncondition the direction and intensity of the sediment transport. If the other mechanisms\n\n155\n\n\n\nSection 4.5 Chapter 4.

The grey dashed lines mark the approximate position of the breakpoint.\n\ndriving sediment transport are small enough or balance each other during a certain\n\nphase of the IG waves, transport by IG waves becomes significant. If this happens\n\nduring an IG-wave phase with negative (positive) velocities, sediment advection will be\n\ndirected offshore (onshore).\n\nBy comparison of wave conditions run over the same beach profile, surf and swash\n\nzone asymmetry was shown to be influenced by the IG waves, with lower asymmetry for\n\nhigher IG-wave heights. Wave conditions with higher IG waves allow a greater water\n\ndepth in the surf and swash zones. Further, IG-wave motion is positively correlated\n\nwith short-wave motion in this zone of the beach profile, as the crests of IG waves allow\n\nthe greatest short-wave of the group to propagate. Therefore, greater IG-wave height\n\nimplies a greater water depth below the greater short-waves of the group, reducing\n\nasymmetry (which is larger for shallower depths).\n\nThe greater offshore transport observed for C1 is justified by the greater absolute\n\nvalues of IG-wave velocity for this condition, the more negative values of the\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nterms directly dependent on IG-wave motion and by the phasing of the moments of\n\n156\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.5\n\nhigher sediment suspension (at the end of each short-wave group) with maximal IG-\n\nwave offshore-directed velocities. The higher IG-waves further contribute to a smaller\n\nasymmetry, promoting even less the onshore sediment transport (in the surf zone).\n\nThe minor capacity for offshore transport of C3 is justified by the lower IG-wave\n\nvelocities, the smaller contribution of\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nterms directly dependent on IG-wave\n\nmotion, the larger asymmetry, in the surf and swash zones and the small modulation\n\nof the short-wave groups (implying that the short-waves are almost equally important\n\nalong each wave group). All these factors imply that IG-wave offshore transport never\n\nhas the possibility of becoming more important than the short-wave-driven onshore\n\ntransport for this wave condition. The maximal modulation of C2 wave groups allows\n\nthe existence of moments along the groups when short-waves are less important. It has\n\nlower absolute values of IG-wave velocity than C1, a smaller contribution of\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\nterms directly dependent on IG-wave motion than C1, the maxima of IG-wave velocity\n\nare not in phase with the moments when more sediment is in suspension and it has\n\ngreater asymmetry than C1. Therefore, although it has mostly a tendency for offshore\n\ntransport, as it is illustrated by the significantly negative values of almost all terms of\n\nthe\n?\n|u|2 u\n\n?\n, its capacity for offshore sediment transport is smaller than that of C1.\n\nThe differences in the morphodynamics between the three wave conditions are thus\n\nexplained by two distinct mechanisms linked to the IG waves: (i) advection by IG-\n\nwaves of sediment suspended by short-wave action (as previously proposed by Aagaard\n\n&amp; Greenwood (2008)), which is dependent on IG-wave height and phasing with the\n\nshort-wave groups and (ii) modulation of short-wave nonlinearities by IG-wave motion,\n\nboth directly and indirectly, through water-depth modulation (which is also dependent\n\non IG-wave height). Moreover, the IG-wave motion was shown to contribute to the\n\nestablishment of a turbidity current, further promoting the offshore transport. To the\n\nknowledge of the author, this link between IG waves and a turbidity current has not\n\nyet been observed in the field.\n\nThe results presented in this work extend the previous findings of Grasso et al.\n\n(2009a) and show that, even when the Dean number is the same, if the IG-wave energy\n\n(or short-wave groups) is different, distinct equilibrium profiles are shaped.\n\nThe swash-zone dynamics was also demonstrated (particularly through the analysis\n\nof the long runs) to be affected by IG-wave height and phasing. Wave run-up and\n\nbeachface gradient adjusted, reacting to the changes induced to the sediment transport\n\nby the varying IG-wave height and phase. As Masselink et al. (2006) stated and Alsina\n\net al. (2012) also observed, the beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the\n\nsurf zone: the changes induced by the IG waves in the upper beach were seen to be\n\nlinked to beach-profile changes in the surf zone and inner-shoaling zone and vice-versa.\n\n157\n\n\n\nSection 4.6 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nIn the shoaling zone equilibrium profile of C1 (Fig. 4.20), there is a sediment\n\naccumulation region around x = 18.5 m. Since in this region of the shoaling the beach\n\nprofile has already a water depth of about 30 cm, short waves are not able of suspending\n\nthere significant quantities of sediment and thus sediment transport must rely on other\n\nmechanisms. IG waves were shown to be able of transporting suspended sediment only\n\nuntil x ? 20.5 m. Therefore, sediment must have been transported as bed load. Since\nIG waves are the factor that changes between C1 and C2 or C3, they are probably\n\nresponsible for this sediment accumulation. However, the sediment accumulated in\n\nthis region during the evolution of the beach profile towards equilibrium. Therefore, in\n\norder to understand the mechanisms responsible for this sediment transport, velocity\n\nmeasurements near the bed during the evolution of the beach profile towards equilibrium\n\nare necessary. Unfortunately, the measurements made during the evolution of the beach\n\nprofiles towards equilibrium were not made simultaneously at different cross-shore\n\npositions (since a single ADV was available). Therefore, no further conclusions can be\n\ndrawn about the accumulation found only for C1 (greater IG waves).\n\nThe IG-wave period was not varied during the experiments performed at the LEGI\n\nin the scope of this work. Still, the results suggest that the shape of the beach profile\n\nmay be influenced by it. Earlier researches, such as those of Short (1975) and Bowen\n\n(1980) have hypothesized that bar formation may be related to the positions of the\n\nstanding-wave nodes and antinodes. Michallet et al. (2007) have shown, also in the\n\nLEGI wave flume, partial evidence of nodal structure consistent with the cross-shore\n\nbar position. Aagaard &amp; Bryan (2003) have argued that, for standing IG waves to be\n\ncapable of imposing spatially segregated sediment transport patterns and thus influence\n\nbar position, they have to be sufficiently energetic and have a reasonably well-defined\n\ncross-shore structure. In the experiments ran, due to IG-wave reflection at the beach\n\nand at the wave-maker, IG-wave height is sufficiently enhanced to generate sufficiently\n\nenergetic IG waves. Further, as the wave conditions ran were bichromatic, defined and\n\ndiscrete modes and frequencies of IG-wave oscillation were preferentially forced and\n\npersisted during the length of the runs (up to 5.3 h, depending on the run), resulting in\n\nwell-defined (partially) standing IG waves. For the different beach profiles obtained,\n\nthe slope break or bar (depending on the wave condition) was located just next to a\n\nfree-surface elevation node of the second mode of oscillation of the flume. This mode\n\nhas, for the different profiles, a period that is very close to that of the IG wave (13.6 s).\n\nTherefore, if wave conditions with a different IG-wave period were run, an adjustment\n\nof the position of slope-break/bar would be expected.\n\n158\n\n\n\nChapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.6\n\n4.6 Conclusion\n\nThe experiments analysed in this chapter were designed to clarify the role of the\n\ninfragravity waves in the sediment transport processes. Three different wave conditions\n\nwere chosen, to have both different IG-wave phasing with the short-wave groups and\n\ndifferent modulation (IG-wave height). Short runs of two-wave groups only and long\n\nruns of a few hours were made over different initial beach profiles, free-surface elevation\n\nand cross-shore velocity were measured and the net sediment transport was quantified.\n\nIG waves alone were shown to be capable of modifying the beach profile, but only\n\nwhen their heights are sufficiently great (highly-energetic waves and storm conditions).\n\nFor the wave conditions run during the experiments, corresponding to mild to moderate\n\nwave conditions in nature, IG waves were only capable of influencing sediment transport\n\nin the presence of short waves.\n\nNo significant differences in terms of wave nonlinearities until the surf zone were\n\nobserved between the different conditions when run over very similar beach profiles.\n\nDue to the difficulty of having accurate velocity measurements in the surf and swash\n\nzones, the SERR1D model was used to simulate cross-shore velocity along the beach\n\nprofile, and the undertow, calculated for a given bed profile, was found to be very\n\nsimilar for the wave conditions considered. The distinct magnitudes and directions of\n\nsediment transport were thus attributed to the influence of the IG waves. Differences\n\nin the third-order velocity moment terms linked to IG-wave motion were shown to\n\ncontribute to differences in the sediment transport. Differences in the phasing of the\n\nIG-waves with the short-wave groups were demonstrated to influence the direction\n\nof sediment transport, as IG waves advect suspended sediment offshore or onshore,\n\ndepending on the wave-phase during which the sediment is available to be transported.\n\nThe modulation of the wave groups was shown to condition the existence of moments\n\nof very small short-waves, during which short-wave skewness and asymmetry are less\n\nimportant, and thus sediment advection by the IG waves can be favoured if enough\n\nsediment is still in suspension.\n\nWhen the same wave condition was run for a sufficiently long time, the beach profile\n\nreaches an equilibrium. When the IG-wave height is significant, the IG waves form\n\nstanding (or partially-standing) wave oscillations that condition the profile shape and\n\nthe morphodynamics. In this case, the equilibrium is dynamic and is characterized by\n\nchanges of the beach profile around a \u201cstatic\u201d equilibrium profile, which are more marked\n\nfor wave conditions with greater IG waves, responding to a changing of incident and\n\nreflected IG-wave heights. The changing of IG-wave phasing promotes, then, changes of\n\nIG-wave height, wave and velocity nonlinearities and the swash dynamics. The resulting\n\nbeachface changes are linked and concurrent to changes in the surf and inner-shoaling\n\n159\n\n\n\nSection 4.6 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics\n\nbeach profiles.\n\nTherefore, both in the long equilibrium runs and in the two-wave-group runs, IG-wave\n\nheight and phasing were shown to influence sediment transport, both by conditioning the\n\nadvection by IG-waves of sediment suspended by short-wave action or by modulating the\n\nshort-wave nonlinearities, both directly and indirectly (through water-depth modulation).\n\nTherefore, the direction of sediment transport by IG waves in the surf and swash zones\n\nis not the same for all the wave conditions and beaches: it depends on (i) the IG-wave\n\nheight and phasing with the short-waves, (ii) the modulation of the short waves and of\n\nthe short-wave nonlinearities promoted by the IG waves and (iii) the beach profile over\n\nwhich the waves propagate.\n\nMore velocity measurements and collocated sediment concentration measurements\n\nwould help better understanding the influence of IG waves on sediment transport,\n\nespecially in what concerns the sediment accumulation in the shoaling zone and the\n\noscillations of the beachface (and their link to the other parts of the profile) observed\n\nduring the equilibrium runs of C1. Velocity measurements in the zones of greater\n\nsediment suspension (with video imagery, for example) and near the bed (to evaluate\n\nthe importance of bed-load transport by the IG waves) and during the transitory runs\n\nbefore equilibrium is reached may bring further insight. Varying the input IG-wave\n\nperiod may help improving the understanding on the potential adjustment of the beach-\n\nprofile shape to the location of the nodes and antinodes of the (partially) standing IG\n\nwaves.\n\n160\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nConclusions and perspectives\n\n5.1 General summary\n\nThe understanding and prediction of beach evolution necessarily implies the com-\n\nprehension of the different processes that promote sediment transport and shape the\n\nbeach morphology. Short-wave nonlinearities (wave and velocity skewness and asym-\n\nmetry) have long been recognised to be one of the crucial mechanisms. Therefore,\n\nit is important to include them in models intended at predicting sediment transport.\n\nCurrently, this is done by defining the velocity nonlinearities at a given moment from\n\nthe local height and length of the waves and the water depth. However, it was shown\n\nin this work, making use of a physical model data set, a field data set and of results\n\nobtained with a Boussinesq-type model, that this represents an incomplete approach\n\nand comprises important errors, particularly onshore and near the breakpoint, where\n\nsediment transport is very important. Hence, a new parameter which takes into account\n\nmore than local wave parameters was proposed, resulting in the improvement of existing\n\nparameterizations.\n\nBesides the short-wave nonlinearities, also infragravity waves were also demonstrated\n\nto have an important role in the dynamics of the beach profile. Contrary to the\n\nshort-wave nonlinearities, which are consensually considered to play an important role\n\non sediment transport, the role of infragravity waves on sediment transport is still a\n\ndebated issue. In this work, through a set of experiments held in a light-weight-sediment\n\nwave flume, it was confirmed that the IG waves are effectively capable of contributing\n\nto sediment transport and this contribution was analysed and characterised.\n\nThe developed research is summarised below, together with the main conclusions,\n\nwhich synthesize the partial ones previously presented at the end of the two main\n\nchapters.\n\n? A high-resolution (in time and space) data set was collected in a very gently-sloping\n\n161\n\n\n\nSection 5.1 Chapter 5.

The analysis of this data set, from the shoaling zone until\n\nthe swash zone, helped distinguishing the distinct behaviours of irregular waves\n\nand bichromatic waves. Irregular waves have a broader surf zone and a linear\n\ndevelopment of the wave nonlinearities until the mid-surf zone; bichromatic waves\n\ndissipate their energy over a narrower surf zone, reform in the mid-surf zone and\n\nhave multiple local maxima of nonlinearity along the cross-shore profile, which\n\nare associated to short-wave breaking, but also to the presence of IG waves, when\n\nthe modulation is sufficiently important. For the same short-wave energy, larger\n\nmodulation results in wave statistics more similar to those of irregular waves:\n\nbroader surf zone, one skewness and asymmetry peak and smaller maximum\n\nnonlinearity.\n\n? Similarly to the short waves, also the IG waves were shown to become progressively\n\nmore nonlinear towards the coast and to end up by breaking (large increase of\n\nwave height and velocity followed by a great decrease). Free IG waves and IG\n\nwaves associated to wave groups do not shoal similarly: while the height of the\n\nincident free IG waves increases linearly towards the coast, incident IG waves\n\nassociated to short-wave groups have a greater height increase near the breakpoint\n\nand have a local wave-height minimum in the mid-surf zone, from whereon their\n\nheight increases again.\n\n? The GLOBEX data set comprised high-resolution measurements of both free-\n\nsurface elevation and velocity. Hence, it was also used to explore the similarit-\n\nies/differences between free-surface elevation and velocity nonlinearities. Even\n\nthough the absolute values of skewness and asymmetry are different, the main\n\ntrends are common to free-surface elevation and velocity. Departing from this\n\nnotion and following the linear wave theory for intermediate water depths, it was\n\nshown that the cross-shore velocity, particularly its skewness and asymmetry,\n\ncan be deduced from the free-surface elevation time series. This is valid until\n\nthe inner-surf zone, where the maxima of skewness and asymmetry are reached.\n\nBeyond, the linear wave theory fails. This procedure can be particularly useful to\n\nretrieve velocity nonlinearities in situations where only free-surface elevation data\n\nare available.\n\n? Differences in the offshore characteristics of some of the GLOBEX wave conditions\n\nwere shown to result in distinct cross-shore trends of the nonlinearities and\n\nespecially on distinct maximum values. This was initially observed for differences\n\nin the spectral bandwidth, for irregular waves, and for differences in the modulation,\n\n162\n\n\n\nChapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives Section 5.1\n\nfor bichromatic waves.\n\n? Using field data collected on several beaches, currently-used parameterizations\n\nof velocity nonlinearities were analysed, leading to the conclusion that local\n\nparameters, such as the local wave height and length and water depth, are not\n\nsufficient to accurately describe skewness and asymmetry. The wave history must\n\nbe taken into account as well.\n\n? The SERR1D numerical model (Cienfuegos et al., 2006, 2007) was validated for\n\nGLOBEX and van Noorloos (2003) data sets. Subsequently, the model was used\n\nto extend the GLOBEX data by simulating sets of wave conditions for which (i)\n\noffshore wave height, (ii) offshore peak period, (iii) offshore spectral bandwidth\n\nand (iv) beach slope were varied. This, together with the field data analysis, led\n\nto the conclusion that the cross-shore evolution of the nonlinearity of irregular\n\nwaves cannot be estimated from local wave parameters only and is effectively\n\ndependent on, at least, three non-local parameters: offshore wave steepness (the\n\nmost important), offshore spectral bandwidth and beach slope (in particular\n\nfor very steep or very mild slopes). For bichromatic waves, the modulation\n\n(infragravity-wave height) was also shown to condition the nonlinearity trends\n\nand maxima.\n\n? A new parameter, NP0, was defined, on which the maximum of nonlinearity\n\nreached by each wave condition was shown to depend. This parameter was then\n\nincorporated, together with the spectral bandwidth, ?, on Ruessink et al. (2012)\n\nparameterization. This resulted in a reduction of the root-mean-square error\n\nbetween real and predicted values of nonlinearity in up to about 60%, relatively\n\nto the former parameterization.\n\n? The short-wave modulation was shown to influence the nonlinearity of bichromatic\n\nwaves. Hence, to explore the possibility that it may also influence sediment\n\ntransport, a set of experiments was performed in the LEGI wave flume with light-\n\nweight sediments. Three wave conditions with the same short-wave energy but\n\ndifferent IG waves were simulated. When run long enough, each wave condition\n\nproduced a distinct equilibrium profile. For smaller IG waves, more sediment\n\nwas accumulated in the surf zone and beachface. For greater IG waves, the bar\n\nwas more marked and sediment accumulated in the shoaling zone before the\n\nbreakpoint. It is thus clear that IG waves influence the shape of equilibrium\n\nprofiles. This extends the previous findings of Grasso et al. (2009a), who had\n\nargued that when the Dean number is the same, the beach profile at equilibrium\n\nis the same.\n\n163\n\n\n\nSection 5.1 Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives\n\n? Two different types of equilibrium were reached: a static and a dynamic. The\n\nstatic equilibrium was observed when IG waves were smaller and was characterised\n\nby a constant bed position. The dynamic equilibrium consisted instead of multiple\n\nslightly-different profiles oscillating around an average profile shape and was\n\nobserved when the IG waves were greater. The periodic enhancement of the IG\n\nwaves (by the lack of a wave-maker with an active reflection compensation system\n\nin the flume) contributed to these oscillations.\n\n? The dynamic equilibrium runs highlighted the fact that, as Masselink et al. (2006)\n\nhad stated, the beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the surf zone:\n\nthe changes induced by the IG waves in the upper-beach were seen to be linked\n\nto beach-profile changes in the surf and inner-shoaling zones, which were coupled\n\nto the hydrodynamics. Slow accretion of the beachface, when IG-wave height\n\nis minimal, results in a more reflective beachface, which contributes to a more\n\nenergetic swash dynamics and to greater IG-wave reflection, thus promoting\n\nIG-wave growth. The accretion of the beachface is accompanied by an accretion\n\njust offshore of the breakpoint and by the definition of a more marked bar (due\n\nto the transport of sediment from the surf zone to the beachface and to the\n\nshoaling zone), increasing energy dissipation at the bar. This results in a less\n\nenergetic swash zone and a less reflective beachface, which promotes IG-wave\n\nheight decrease. When an IG-wave height minimum is reached, the slow accretion\n\nof the beachface can start again and the cycle continues.\n\n? To avoid the effect of IG waves re-reflected at the wave maker, a series of runs\n\nwith only two wave groups was conducted. The IG waves were then shown to\n\nbe capable of influencing sediment transport, by two distinct mechanisms: (i)\n\nadvection by IG-waves of sediment suspended by short-wave action, which is\n\ndependent on the IG-wave height and phasing with the short-wave groups and\n\n(ii) modulation of short-wave nonlinearities by IG-wave motion, both directly and\n\nindirectly, through water-depth modulation.\n\n? The presence of a re-suspension maximum, where short-waves mobilize the sedi-\n\nment, which is then advected by the IG waves, as previously suggested by Aagaard\n\n&amp; Greenwood (2008), was observed at the breakpoint position. When the modu-\n\nlation of the wave groups is higher, IG-wave velocities are larger and there are\n\nperiods during which short waves are very small. In the absence of short-waves\n\nwith positive skewness and asymmetry promoting onshore transport, the trans-\n\nport by the IG waves becomes important. Therefore, a certain modulation is\n\nnecessary in order for the IG-wave transport to become significant relative to the\n\n164\n\n\n\nChapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives Section 5.2\n\nother sediment transport mechanisms (skewness and asymmetry of short waves,\n\nundertow). The greatest concentration of suspended sediment was observed near\n\nthe end of each wave group. The greatest transport by the IG waves was observed\n\nfor the wave condition which had the greatest negative velocities also near the end\n\nof each wave group. The phasing between the IG waves and short waves was thus\n\nshown to condition both the magnitude and direction of the sediment advected\n\nby the IG waves.\n\n? The direction and magnitude of the sediment transport is always dependent\n\non the initial beach profile: the same wave condition may promote offshore or\n\nonshore transport, depending on the relative importance of the different transport\n\nmechanisms, which depend also on the profile morphology, not only on the\n\nhydrodynamics.\n\n5.2 Perspectives\n\n5.2.1 Concerning GLOBEX data\n\nThe GLOBEX project provided an uncommon data set, especially in terms of velocity\n\nmeasurements, which are not very often available with such high resolution (in time\n\nand in space). This makes this data set ideal for analysing the evolution of the wave\n\nnonlinearities along the beach profile, for different wave conditions. The nonlinearities\n\nand IG-waves of the GLOBEX irregular-wave conditions have been extensively analysed\n\n(also by Rocha et al. (2013a); de Bakker et al. (2014); Ruju et al. (2014); among others)\n\nand are starting to be well understood. However, several issues rest to be clarified\n\nregarding the bichromatic wave conditions.\n\n? The cause of the reformation of short-waves in the mid-surf zone, which does not\n\nhappen for irregular waves.\n\n? The variation of the incident IG-wave height in the surf zone: confirm if the\n\nmechanism proposed by Baldock (2012) can explain the marked decrease in\n\nIG-wave height after the breakpoint and explain the subsequent increase in the\n\nmid-surf zone.\n\n? The generation of IG-waves by the varying-breakpoint mechanism. Even if\n\nthe beach is a very gently-sloping one, there seems to be evidence of IG-wave\n\ngeneration by the varying-breakpoint mechanism, at least for the bichromatic\n\nwaves. Since this may interfer with the propagation of the reflected IG waves\n\n165\n\n\n\nSection 5.2 Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives\n\nand the interaction between short and IG waves, this issue merits to be further\n\ninvestigated.\n\n? The multiple skewness and asymmetry peaks of the bichromatic wave conditions.\n\nThey seem to be related to short-wave breaking zones and the influence of IG-\n\nwaves (correlation between short-waves and IG waves). A possible link between\n\nIG-wave minima and skewness and asymmetry maxima was observed, but further\n\nresearch is necessary for a more thorough understanding.\n\n? The simulation of the bichromatic wave conditions with the SERR1D numerical\n\nmodel. Since the different nonlinearity peaks are not well explained, it was not\n\npossible to simulate them accurately with the SERR1D model, which can be\n\nimproved if the origin of the different peaks is better understood.\n\nRetrospectively on the choice of the wave conditions to be run, it would have\n\nbeen good to consider B3 wave condition with the same IG-wave period and greater\n\nmodulation than B2, as it was done, but with the same short-wave energy as well.\n\nThis would allow a more direct analysis of the influence of the IG-wave height on the\n\nnonlinearities.\n\n5.2.2 Concerning the parameterization of nonlinearities\n\nThe Ruessink et al. (2012) parameterization was improved for the data presented in\n\nthis work. To further validate this improvement, it should be applied to other data sets.\n\nThe improvement of the parameterization was reached through the change of only\n\ntwo of its parameters. Modifying the other parameters may bring further improvement,\n\nespecially for the nonlinearity values in the end of the shoaling. This modification may\n\nprobably be based on the NP0 and ? as well.\n\nIf a large experimental or field data set with velocity measurements for wave conditions\n\nwith different wave steepness, beach slope and spectral bandwidth is available, the\n\nmodified expressions of Ruessink et al. (2012) parameters may be improved, by reducing\n\nthe fitting error of Bmax and ?(Ur=1) to NP0 and ?.\n\n5.2.3 Concerning the LEGI experiments\n\nThe LEGI wave flume is a unique facility, which correctly represents many of the\n\nhydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes that exist in nature. However, it has still\n\nsome technical limitations which limit the comprehension of certain processes.\n\n? In the scope of this thesis, the first technical limitation was the lack of a wave-\n\nmaker with an active reflection compensation system. This implied that IG waves\n\n166\n\n\n\nChapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives Section 5.2\n\nproduced by the wave-maker that reflected back at the beach remained \u201ctrapped\u201d\n\nin the flume, since they re-reflected back at the wave-maker, and so on, until the\n\nend of each experiment, when they finally dissipate. Therefore, the IG-wave height\n\nin the flume was constantly enhanced and the equilibrium profiles reached do\n\nnot correspond to the equilibrium profiles that would be reached if the IG waves\n\nreflected at the beach were not re-reflected at the wave-maker (and which would be\n\nmore directly comparable to nature). The evolution of the beach profile towards\n\nequilibrium was also more complex to study due to the constant enhancement of\n\nthe IG waves, particularly for the wave condition with the largest modulation.\n\n? The sediment transport rate can be deduced from the variation of the bed position\n\nbetween the beginning and the end of each run. However, the variation of the bed\n\nposition during one run (which allows, for example, the following of the action of\n\neach short-wave or wave group) cannot be tracked with the optical bed profiler.\n\nA way to overcome this limitation is to use video imagery. Video imagery has the\n\nadvantage of not influencing the flow (as typical instruments to measure velocity\n\nand sediment concentration do) and can be developed to detect the interface\n\nbetween the fluid and the bed and thus to follow the evolution of the bed position\n\nduring the runs. Furthermore, it is possibly the only solution at the moment\n\nto make accurate velocity measurements in zones of high sediment suspension\n\nor very shallow water, which was also one of the limitations of this study that\n\nobliged the utilization of a numerical model to overcome the problem. Having\n\naccurate and simultaneous velocity measurements along the entire profile, and\n\nespecially in the zones of greater sediment suspension (near the breakpoint and in\n\nthe surf zone), would allow a better characterisation of the beach-profile evolution\n\ntowards equilibrium. Furthermore, obtaining velocity measurements near the bed,\n\nparticularly in the shoaling zone, would help further exploring the possibility of\n\nbed-load sediment transport by the IG waves.\n\n? By running experiments of only two wave groups and comparing wave conditions\n\nwith different modulation, the role of IG-wave phasing relatively to the short-wave\n\ngroups and the short-wave sediment-suspension events was investigated and the\n\nimportance of this phasing was underlined. To further confirm and extend the\n\nfindings on this issue, sediment concentration measurements would be of great\n\nvalue. Measuring the velocity and concentration simultaneously and at the same\n\nlocations would confirm the observed correlation between IG-wave motion and\n\nsediment transport, as well as the importance of the mentioned phasing.\n\nEven within the referred technical limitations, other experiments similar to those\n\n167\n\n\n\nSection 5.2 Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives\n\nperformed in the scope of this thesis can help increasing the current knowledge on\n\nIG-wave sediment transport. In this work, only three wave conditions were run in the\n\nLEGI wave flume. More wave conditions with the same short-wave energy and different\n\ndegrees of modulation can further extend the present findings. Moreover, varying the\n\nperiod of the IG waves may help confirming the possible relation between the IG waves\n\nand the profile shape and, especially, the bar position.\n\n5.2.4 General perspectives\n\nThe ultimate aim of being able of understanding wave nonlinearities and infragravity\n\nwaves is to include their contribution in the prediction of the beach dynamics. For that\n\npurpose, some perspective work can be envisaged, based on the results obtained in this\n\nthesis.\n\nThe improved estimations of B and ? parameters can be used, through Abreu\n\net al. (2010) formulation, to provide a better estimation of the free-stream near-bed\n\nhorizontal orbital motion. Many sand transport models evaluate the sediment transport\n\nas a function of the orbital velocity just above the wave boundary layer or of the\n\nbed shear stress (e.g. Meyer-Peter &amp; Mu?ller, 1948; Nielsen, 1992; Abreu et al., 2013),\n\nwhich can also be obtained from the orbital velocity (e.g. Ribberink &amp; Al-Salem,\n\n1994; Nielsen, 2006). Hence, the new version provided of the parameterization of the\n\nvelocity nonlinearities can be of further use to ameliorate current estimates of sediment\n\ntransport. The data set of the LEGI wave-flume experiments can then used to validate\n\nthe prediction of sediment transport.\n\nThe infragravity waves were also shown to influence sediment transport and thus their\n\ncontribution must be included in sediment-transport models as well. Parameterizations\n\nof the sediment transport such as the one proposed by Marin?o-Tapia et al. (2007)\n\nalready include the influence of the infragravity-waves, through different terms of\n\nthe near-bed velocity moments. However, the presence of infragravity waves is not\n\ncondition enough for infragravity-wave-driven transport to exist: the phasing between\n\nthe infragravity-waves and the moments of higher sediment suspension can condition\n\nboth the magnitude and direction of sediment transport. Hence, the inclusion of a\n\nparameter related to this phasing in the parameterizations has to be envisaged. A\n\npotential approach may be similar to that of Dubarbier et al. (2015), which added an\n\nextra sediment-transport term to the two classical terms of bed-load and suspended-load\n\nfluxes to account for an acceleration-skewness (velocity asymmetry) induced transport.\n\nA new sediment-transport term can be imagined, which takes into account the IG-wave\n\nvelocity magnitude and the phasing between IG waves and the short-wave groups (and\n\nthe higher sediment-suspension events) and represents the transport by IG waves.\n\n168\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nAagaard, T. &amp; Bryan, K.
