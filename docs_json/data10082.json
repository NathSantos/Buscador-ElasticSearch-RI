The \n\nlimited oil reserves, pollution concerns, global warming and political instability and disagreements, \n\nlead to an increased financial support for sustainable and environmental sources of energy, biofuels. \n\nIn the last decades there is an increasing interest in the development of the bioethanol production \n\nfrom lignocellulosic residues, which do not compete directly with food. However, the low efficient \n\nconversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuels hinders its success. Alternative substrates are inulin \n\ncontaining plants, as Jerusalem artichoke, representing a renewable and inexpensive raw material \n\nfor industry and biofuel production. In this work, the main goal was to search for new \n\nmicroorganisms, with high potential to produce bioethanol, due to the presence of better \n\nethanologenic characteristics or ability to produce relevant hydrolytic enzymatic machinery. From the \n\nisolation and screening of 98 novel strains, 7 were selected and further characterized. A preliminary \n\nidentification was performed using FISH. Three isolates which showed inulinase capacity gave a \n\nputative identification as Z. bailii strains, and the best (Talf1) was optimized and characterized for \n\ninulinase production. Talf1 enzymatic extract presented maximum activity (8.7 U/ml) at 45 \u00baC and pH \n\n5.5, and high stability at 30\u00baC. Talf1 isolate was used in a Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) and its \n\nenzymatic extract in a Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) process, for \n\nbioethanol production, obtaining an ethanol yield of 45% and 47% from pure inulin; and a yield of \n\n51% and 48% from Jerusalem artichoke juice, respectively. Four selected isolates from strawberry \n\ntree fruit (STF) were used in a fermentation assay using STF juice, producing 86 - 100 g/l of ethanol \n\nfrom this raw material, at a very high yield (47-50%). These results show the enormous potential of \n\ninulin and Jerusalem artichoke as substrates for bioethanol production and the application of these \n\nnovel yeasts as ethanol and/or inulinase producers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: Bioethanol; Bioprocesses; Inulinases; Jerusalem artichoke; Fluorescence in situ \n\nhybridization. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIV \n\nResumo \n\nA explora\u00e7\u00e3o de novos recursos energ\u00e9ticos foi crucial para a revolu\u00e7\u00e3o tecnol\u00f3gica que \n\nocorreu no in\u00edcio do s\u00e9culo 19. J\u00e1 nesse s\u00e9culo se conhecia o enorme potencial do \u00e1lcool como \n\nfonte de energia, visto que o primeiro prot\u00f3tipo de motor de igni\u00e7\u00e3o foi desenhado para funcionar \n\ncom este combust\u00edvel. No in\u00edcio do s\u00e9culo 20, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol foi substitu\u00edda pela gasolina, \n\ndevido ao baixo custo de extra\u00e7\u00e3o. Os combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis t\u00eam sido, desde ent\u00e3o, a principal fonte \n\nde energia utilizada. O r\u00e1pido aumento da popula\u00e7\u00e3o tem intensificado a necessidade do aumento \n\nde produ\u00e7\u00e3o alimentar e energ\u00e9tica. \n\n \nAs limitadas reservas de petr\u00f3leo, preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais, o aquecimento global e a \n\ninstabilidade pol\u00edtica renovaram o interesse e, consequentemente, o apoio financeiro direcionada \n\npara o desenvolvimento de fontes renov\u00e1veis de energia, como os biocombust\u00edveis. V\u00e1rios tipos de \n\nbiocombust\u00edveis t\u00eam sido estudados, mas apenas dois s\u00e3o produzidos \u00e0 escala industrial: o \n\nbiodiesel e o bioetanol. O bioetanol apresenta as melhores qualidades para a sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o nos \n\natuais motores, podendo ser utilizado como aditivo na gasolina, sendo por isso, o biocombust\u00edvel \n\nmais utilizado a n\u00edvel mundial (Antoni et al., 2007). \n\n \nA produ\u00e7\u00e3o mundial de bioetanol \u00e0 escala industrial utiliza principalmente duas fontes naturais: \n\nSaccharum officinarum (cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar) e Zea mays L. (milho). A cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar \u00e9 sobretudo \n\nutilizada no Brasil, sendo o segundo maior produtor mundial de bioetanol, enquanto o milho \u00e9 a \n\nprincipal fonte natural utilizada nos E.U.A., o maior produtor mundial. Estes dois pa\u00edses representam \n\n88% da produ\u00e7\u00e3o global (REN21). \n\n \nNa produ\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol ocorre a fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o alco\u00f3lica dos substratos naturais, diretamente a \n\npartir da cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar (que cont\u00e9m principalmente sacarose); para a bioconvers\u00e3o do milho \n\n(composto principalmente por amido) h\u00e1 necessidade de um passo pr\u00e9vio de hidr\u00f3lise enzim\u00e1tica \n\npara a sua convers\u00e3o em a\u00e7\u00facares simples. O bioetanol obtido a partir de culturas agr\u00edcolas \n\nproduzidas exclusivamente para esse fim, ocupando assim \u00e1rea cultiv\u00e1vel, denomina-se Bioetanol \n\nde 1\u00aa Gera\u00e7\u00e3o (1G). Este tipo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o levanta quest\u00f5es morais e \u00e9ticas porque, deste modo, o \n\nbioetanol compete diretamente com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o alimentar (Luo et al., 2009).  \n\n \nPara ultrapassar este problema, tem sido proposto a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos lenhocelul\u00f3sicos, \n\ncomo substratos, para produ\u00e7\u00e3o de Bioetanol de 2\u00aa Gera\u00e7\u00e3o (2G). Este bioetanol n\u00e3o compete \n\ndiretamente com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o alimentar, apesar de consumir recursos agroindustriais. Atualmente a \n\nconvers\u00e3o de biomassa lenhocelul\u00f3sica em bioetanol \u00e9 ainda um procedimento caro e de baixa \n\nefici\u00eancia, sendo economicamente desfavor\u00e1vel a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o (Gibbons and Hughes, 2009). O \n\nprincipal obst\u00e1culo \u00e9 o custo do pr\u00e9-tratamento para convers\u00e3o dos v\u00e1rios pol\u00edmeros (celulose, \n\nhemicelulose, xilano, etc.) em a\u00e7ucares simples (glucose e xilose principalmente) que esta \n\nbiomassa necessita, quer seja por degrada\u00e7\u00e3o enzim\u00e1tica (com custos associados de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nextratos enzim\u00e1ticos); quer seja a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9todos qu\u00edmicos, como hidr\u00f3lise \u00e1cida (que para \n\nal\u00e9m do seu custo, leva \u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o de composto inibidores do crescimento microbiano). \n\n\n\nV \n\n \n Existem v\u00e1rios bioprocessos propostos para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o em larga escala de 2G nomeadamente \n\na hidr\u00f3lise separada da fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o (SHF), em que o passo de hidr\u00f3lise da biomassa \n\nlenhocelul\u00f3sica antecede a fase de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol; a fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o e sacarifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsimult\u00e2neas (SSF), neste caso h\u00e1 a adi\u00e7\u00e3o ex\u00f3gena de enzimas ou a co-fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o de biomassa \n\ncom um microrganismo produtor das enzimas necess\u00e1rias \u00e0 convers\u00e3o dos pol\u00edmeros nos seus \n\nmon\u00f3meros, disponibilizando assim os a\u00e7\u00facares simples para o microrganismo etanolog\u00e9nico os \n\nconverter em etanol; e o bioprocesso consolidado (CBP), em que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de enzimas para a \n\nhidr\u00f3lise enzim\u00e1tica e a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol ocorrem por a\u00e7\u00e3o do mesmo microrganismo \n\n(considerado o melhor processo conceptual) (Lynd, 1996). \n\n \nInfelizmente n\u00e3o est\u00e1 descrito nenhum microrganismo que, simultaneamente, seja capaz de \n\nproduzir a maquinaria enzim\u00e1tica necess\u00e1ria para a hidr\u00f3lise da biomassa lenhocelul\u00f3sica e que a \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol atinja valores de rendimento e produtividade economicamente vi\u00e1veis. \n\n \nDadas as dificuldades de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 escala industrial do 2G e movidos por preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nambientais, de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de solos cultiv\u00e1veis e o desequil\u00edbrio atual no ciclo de carbono, levou \n\nalguns cientistas a desenvolver o Bioetanol de 3\u00aa Gera\u00e7\u00e3o (3G). Este bioetanol recorre a microalgas \n\ncom elevado conte\u00fado nutritivo para a sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o. Ao inv\u00e9s de aproveitar res\u00edduos \n\nagroindustriais como substrato, as algas s\u00e3o produzidas explorando os recursos h\u00eddricos para a \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de biomassa. Desta forma, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 competi\u00e7\u00e3o com produ\u00e7\u00e3o alimentar nem \u00e1rea \n\ncultiv\u00e1vel e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos agroindustriais. No entanto, o baixo rendimento de \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de biomassa torna este processo, ainda, economicamente invi\u00e1vel \u00e0 escala industrial \n\n(Goh and Lee, 2010). \n\n \nUma alternativa a estas op\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de plantas produtoras de inulina, como Helianthus \n\ntuberosus (tupinambo), que representam um recurso renov\u00e1vel, barato e abundante para a \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol. O tupinambo tem v\u00e1rias caracter\u00edsticas importantes que justificam a sua \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, nomeadamente a toler\u00e2ncia a frio, \u00e0 seca, ao vento e a terrenos arenosos e/ou salinos, \n\ncom uma alta taxa de fertilidade e de resist\u00eancia a pestes e doen\u00e7as, n\u00e3o necessitando \n\nobrigatoriamente de terrenos f\u00e9rteis para se desenvolver. Estas caracter\u00edsticas tornam-no numa \n\nfonte apetec\u00edvel de biomassa para convers\u00e3o em bioetanol que n\u00e3o compete pelos terrenos \n\ncultiv\u00e1veis utilizados para produ\u00e7\u00e3o alimentar (Neagu and Bahrim, 2011; Chi et al., 2011; Bajpai and \n\nMargaritis, 1982). \n\n \nEste trabalho teve como objetivo a procura de novos microrganismos, especialmente leveduras, \n\na partir de isolamentos de diferentes fontes naturais, nomeadamente dos frutos de alfarrobeira \n\n(Ceratonia s\u00edliqua), ameixeira (Prunus domestica), cerejeira (Prunus avium), figueira (Ficus carica), \n\nmedronheiro (Arbutus unedo) e pessegueiro  (Prunus persica) e tub\u00e9rculos de tupinambo \n\n(Helianthus tuberosus). Os microrganismos foram selecionados com base nas suas caracter\u00edsticas \n\netanolog\u00e9nicas (maior toler\u00e2ncia a elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de etanol, pH e temperatura e, por isso, \n\n\n\nVI \n\ncapazes de fermenta\u00e7\u00f5es alco\u00f3licas mais longas); e/ou na capacidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de enzimas \n\nrelevantes, como inulinases, para posterior aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em bioprocessos industriais.  \n\n \nA partir de 98 isolados, dos quais 90 eram leveduras e 8 bact\u00e9rias, foram selecionados 7 \n\nisolados diferentes. Destes, 3 isolados foram selecionados porque apresentaram capacidade de \n\nconverter inulina purificada em etanol; os outros 4 isolados foram selecionados porque foram \n\ncapazes de produzir etanol mais rapidamente, utilizando sumo de medronho como meio completo. \n\n \n\u00c0s 7 estirpes foi aplicado um procedimento de identifica\u00e7\u00e3o preliminar, utilizando sondas \n\nmarcadas com um fluor\u00f3foro, para hibrida\u00e7\u00e3o de fluoresc\u00eancia in situ (FISH), especificas para v\u00e1rias \n\nesp\u00e9cies de leveduras v\u00ednicas, nomeadamente: Hanseniaspora uvarum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, \n\nLachancea thermotolerans, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Torulaspora \n\ndelbrueckii e Zygosaccharomyces bailii. \n\n \nAs 7 estirpes apresentaram um resultado positivo para apenas uma destas sondas, distribuindo-\n\nse por tr\u00eas esp\u00e9cies diferentes: Lachancea thermotolerans (AP1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DP2 \n\ne GluP4) e Zygosaccharomyces bailii (GerP3, Calf2, Talf1 e Talf2). Foi realizado um controlo \n\npositivo em cada experiencia de FISH para cada sonda testada, utilizaram-se estirpes identificadas \n\ne existentes no laborat\u00f3rio, nomeadamente: CBS 314 (Hanseniaspora uvarum), Kluyveromyces \n\nmarxianus 516F, CBS 2803 (Lachancea thermotolerans), NRRL Y-987 (Metschnikowia pulcherrima), \n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI 885, PYCC 4478 (Torulaspora delbrueckii) e Zygosaccharomyces \n\nbailii 518F.  \n\n \nFoi tamb\u00e9m utilizada uma sonda universal para c\u00e9lulas eucariotas (EUK516) em todas as \n\nc\u00e9lulas utilizadas, como controlo positivo, de forma a assegurar a presen\u00e7a de RNA acess\u00edvel nas \n\nc\u00e9lulas ap\u00f3s o procedimento de fixa\u00e7\u00e3o, essencial na t\u00e9cnica de FISH. Esta identifica\u00e7\u00e3o preliminar \n\ndever\u00e1 ser validada com t\u00e9cnicas moleculares mais precisas, complementadas com estudos \n\ncompletos de morfologia e fisiologia. \n\n \nDas estirpes preliminarmente identificadas como Z. bailii, tr\u00eas (Calf2, Talf1 e Talf2) \n\napresentaram capacidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de inulinases, uma carater\u00edstica n\u00e3o referenciada em \n\nestirpes desta esp\u00e9cie (Kurtzman et al., 2011). Foi tra\u00e7ado um perfil metab\u00f3lico das estirpes, Calf2, \n\nTalf1 e Talf2, em confronto com a estirpe Z. bailii 518F utilizando duas galerias API distintas: API \n\nZYM and the API 20C AUX. Conclui-se que as tr\u00eas estirpes t\u00eam perfiz metab\u00f3licos semelhantes \n\nentre si e com Z. bailii 518F, revelando caracter\u00edsticas fisiol\u00f3gicas importantes para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o futura. \n\n \nA produ\u00e7\u00e3o de inulinases \u00e9 uma caracter\u00edstica essencial para a fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o de inulina em \n\netanol, permitindo a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de mat\u00e9rias-primas ricas em inulina como substrato para produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nbioetanol. Com esta finalidade, foi avaliada a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de inulinases extracelulares das 3 estirpes, \n\nutilizando dois substratos indutores: a inulina (extra\u00edda de chic\u00f3ria) e o sumo de tupinambo. A \n\nestirpe Talf1 apresentou maior atividade enzim\u00e1tica extracelular quando induzida com sumo de \n\ntupinambo (8,7 U/ml) do que a estirpe Calf2 e Talf2, que atingiram 4,1 e 7,8 U/ml respetivamente. \n\n\n\nVII \n\nUtilizando inulina purificada como substrato indutor, todas as estirpes atingiram aproximadamente \n\n0,6 U/ml de atividade enzim\u00e1tica no extrato celular, o que demonstra a fraca capacidade de indu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npor parte da inulina purificada. \n\n \nDe forma a otimizar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de inulinases, utilizando a estirpe Talf1, foram testados outros \n\nsubstratos como indutores de inulinases: duas inulinas comerciais, extra\u00eddas de fontes naturais \n\ndiferentes; e tr\u00eas mat\u00e9rias-primas: ra\u00edzes de acelga, tub\u00e9rculos de d\u00e1lia e o res\u00edduo s\u00f3lido de \n\ntupinambo, obtido ap\u00f3s extra\u00e7\u00e3o do sumo. Conclui-se que as inulinas comerciais purificadas s\u00e3o \n\nfracos indutores, n\u00e3o atingindo valores superiores a 0,6 U/ml, enquanto todas as mat\u00e9rias-primas \n\nnaturais induziram positivamente a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de inulinases, obtendo 1,9 U/ml com ra\u00edzes de acelga, \n\n1,5 U/ml com tub\u00e9rculos de d\u00e1lia e 5,9 com o res\u00edduo s\u00f3lido de tupinambo. Concluiu-se que o \n\ntupinambo, em particular o sumo, \u00e9 o melhor substrato indutor, para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de inulinases \n\nextracelulares utilizando a estirpe Talf1. \n\n \nFoi feita a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o bioqu\u00edmica do extrato enzim\u00e1tico desta estirpe, revelando que a \n\ntemperatura e o pH \u00f3timos de atividade s\u00e3o 45 \u00baC e 5,5 respetivamente. Foi determinada a \n\nestabilidade \u00e0 temperatura e ao pH; o extrato enzim\u00e1tico manteve 57% da sua atividade inicial ao \n\nfim de 24 dias, quando mantido a 30 \u00baC e ao pH natural (5,5). No entanto altera\u00e7\u00f5es de pH \n\ndiminuem drasticamente a estabilidade do extrato (a 30 \u00baC). As caracter\u00edsticas do extrato enzim\u00e1tico \n\nda estirpe Talf1 s\u00e3o promissoras para a sua posterior utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o em bioprocessos que utilizem \n\ninulina ou fontes ricas em inulina como substrato desde que ocorram a pH \u00e1cido (aproximadamente \n\n5,5) e \u00e0 temperatura de 30 \u00baC. \n\n \nDadas as caracter\u00edsticas descritas, a estirpe Talf1 foi utilizada num bioprocesso consolidado \n\n(CBP) e o respetivo extrato enzim\u00e1tico utilizado num processo de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o e sacarifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsimult\u00e2neas (SSF) para produ\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol. Para o processo SSF foi utilizada a estirpe \n\netanolog\u00e9nica S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 e o meio foi suplementado com o extrato enzim\u00e1tico \n\nproduzido por Talf1.  \n\n \nNa utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de inulina como \u00fanica fonte de carbono, o processo SSF apresentou maior \n\nrendimento e produtividade m\u00e1ximos de etanol (47% e 2,75 g.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) e obteve-se maior \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol no meio (78 g/l), enquanto no processo CBP produziram-se 67 g/l de etanol, \n\ncom um rendimento e produtividade m\u00e1ximos de 45% e 1,70 g.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1 \n\nrespetivamente. \n\n \n Foi realizado, em paralelo, um crescimento controlo com S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 e inulina \n\ncomo \u00fanica fonte de carbono. Nestas condi\u00e7\u00f5es, foram produzidas apenas 50 g/l de etanol, o que \n\ndemonstra que a adi\u00e7\u00e3o do extrato enzim\u00e1tico levou \u00e0 hidr\u00f3lise de pol\u00edmeros de inulina que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o \n\nutilizados naturalmente por S. cerevisiae, apesar desta estirpe conseguir produzir enzimas que \n\ndegradam parcialmente pol\u00edmeros de inulina. \n\n \nA produ\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol a partir diretamente de sumo de tupinambo foi testada pelos dois \n\nbioprocessos (SSF e CBP). Neste caso obtiveram-se melhores resultados utilizando a levedura \n\n\n\nVIII \n\nTalf1 no bioprocesso consolidado. A estirpe Talf1 atingiu melhor produtividade (3,62 g.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n,), \n\nrendimento (51%) e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1ximas de etanol (67 g/l), do que a estirpe S. cerevisiae CCMI \n\n885 em sumo de tupinambo (SSF), suplementado com o extrato enzim\u00e1tico contendo inulinases, \n\nque produziu 62 g/l de etanol, com um rendimento e produtividade m\u00e1ximos de 48% e 2,40 g.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n, \n\nrespetivamente. \n\n \nNo ensaio controlo, utilizando a levedura S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 sem adi\u00e7\u00e3o de qualquer \n\nenzima, obtiveram-se menores resultados de rendimento e produtividade m\u00e1xima (42% e 2,07 g.l\n-\n\n1\n.h\n\n-1\n) e apenas 55 g/l de etanol produzido, um valor inferior aos resultados obtidos com os anteriores \n\nbioprocessos. Estes resultados s\u00e3o consistentes com os obtidos apenas com inulina como fonte de \n\ncarbono, refor\u00e7ando a hip\u00f3tese de que esta estirpe, S. cerevisiae CCMI 885, seja capaz de \n\nhidrolisar algumas cadeias de inulina, mas n\u00e3o utilizar todos os a\u00e7\u00facares presentes no sumo de \n\ntupinambo. \n\n \nEstes resultados mostram o potencial da inulina e fontes naturais ricas em inulina, como o \n\ntupinambo, para fontes alternativas na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol. No entanto para a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o industrial \n\ndas estirpes descritas neste trabalho, ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1ria posterior otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o de todo o processo. \n\n \nAs 4 leveduras selecionadas a partir do rastreio inicial de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o de sumo de medronho (L. \n\nthermotolerans AP1, S. cerevisiae DP2, S. cerevisiae GluP4 e Z. bailii GerP3), foram utilizadas num \n\nensaio de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o de sumo de medronho, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com S. cerevisiae CCMI 885. O \n\nmelhor resultado foi obtido com a estirpe S. cerevisiae CCMI 885, atingindo-se 108 g/l de etanol, \n\ncom um rendimento m\u00e1ximo de 51%, igual ao te\u00f3rico poss\u00edvel, e uma produtividade m\u00e1xima de 1,29 \n\ng.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n. \n\n \nNo entanto, a estirpe de Z. bailii GerP3, com valores m\u00e1ximos de etanol, produtividade e \n\nrendimento m\u00e1ximos de 100 g/l, 1,11 g.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n e 50%, respetivamente, s\u00e3o pr\u00f3ximos daqueles obtidos \n\ncom a levedura S. cerevisiae. A estirpe Z. bailii GerP3 obteve, por isso, os resultados mais \n\npromissores para a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o num sistema de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o em estado s\u00f3lido diretamente a partir de \n\nmedronho. \n\n \nO desenvolvimento de um processo eficiente e economicamente vi\u00e1vel para produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nbioetanol \u00e9 crucial para a sociedade atual, servindo como alternativa \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de combust\u00edveis \n\nf\u00f3sseis, para uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o mundial que requer cada vez mais energia.  \n\nA utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de fontes naturais como o tupinambo e o medronho, para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de bioetanol, \n\npode ajudar a reduzir a depend\u00eancia energ\u00e9tica dos combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis. No entanto, para produzir \n\nindustrialmente bioetanol a partir destas fontes naturais renov\u00e1veis, e ainda necess\u00e1ria a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo processo a escala industrial.  \n\n\n\nIX \n\nIndex \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements ......................................................................................................................

Introduction \n\n1.1. Biofuels \n\nThroughout history, mankind has relied on renewable energy sources like wood, windmills, water \n\nwheels and animals for sustainability. The development of new energy resources was crucial for the \n\ntechnological revolution occurred in the 19\nth\n century. Early in that century, alcohols were repeatedly \n\nreported as biofuels, alongside combustion, they were transformed into solvents, greases, cleaners or \n\nsimple chemicals for the emerging chemical industry, ending with fossil fuel breakthrough. The first \n\nprototype for a spark ignition engine, by Nikolaus August Otto in the 1860s, was designed for ethanol and \n\nsponsored by the sugar factory of Eugen Langen. Later, in 1902, one third of Eugen Langen new \n\ncompany (Deutz Gas Engine Works) heavy locomotives ran on pure ethanol (Antoni et al., 2007). During \n\nthe beginning of the 20\nth\n century, ethanol was recognized as an anti-knocking additive for internal \n\ncombustion engines and was added to gasoline between 1925 and 1945. Even Henry Ford, a well known \n\nautomotive inventor, believed the \u201cfuel of the future\u201d was ethyl alcohol made from farm products and \n\ncellulosic materials (Kovarik, 1998). He was involved in the chemurgy movement, which proposed the use \n\nof farm products for chemicals and energy production (Finlay, 2004). In the 1940s, ethanol production for \n\nfuel purposes was overthrown by gasoline\u2019s low price in USA. Fossil fuel has been, since then, the major \n\nenergy source used.  \n\nIn the past few decades, the rapid global population growth has increased the demand for higher food \n\nand energy production (Goldemberg, 2007; Nass et al., 2007; Ragauskas et al., 2006). The world\u2019s fossil \n\nfuel reservoir and its extraction will not keep pace with the society\u2019s need for petrochemical fuels. Several \n\nfactors led to a renewed interest for biofuels, namely, the limited oil reserves, pollution concerns, global \n\nwarming and political instability and disagreements, leading to an increased financial support for more \n\nsustainable and environmental friendly sources of energy (Antoni et al., 2007; Ragauskas et al., 2006).  \n\nBiofuel refers to fuel source generated from agricultural products, as crops or other organic material, \n\nobtained from other industries residues, such as crop residues, perennial grasses or alternative crops \n\nwith higher productivity in impoverished soils. In Table 1 are compiled most recent biofuels and research \n\nstatus for its application. The biodiesel and bioethanol research areas are the only reproduced in \n\nindustrial scale. Counting with ETBE (Ethyl Tert-Butyl Ether), which is primarily made by bioethanol, these \n\n3 fuels compose 90% of all biofuel market. The main component for biodiesel is a monoalkyl ester of fatty \n\nacids from vegetable oil and is presently produced by catalytic transesterification with petro-chemically \n\nderived methanol (Ma and Hanna, 1999). Although biodiesel is not microbially produced, several research \n\ngroups have focus on the utilization of microalgae, grown in photobioreactors, which reduces the specific \n\ndemand of land area needed for oil derived from plants (Chisti, 2007); another potential approach \n\nfollowed for biodiesel bacterial production is microdiesel (Kalscheuer et al., 2006) where bacterial strains \n\nare selected and/or improved to increase fatty acids content of cells, which yields higher production rates \n\nfor the  biodiesel extraction directly from cells, and there by allow the use of  different carbon sources or \n\nraw materials to serve as growth medium. \n\n \n\n\n\n2 \n\nTable 1. List of selected biofuels with a potential microbial production route, the status of their use and the engine application (adapted \n\nfrom Antoni et al., 2007). \n\nBiofuel Process Status Engine application \n\nBiomethanol Thermochemical/microbial Pilot plant [Pure/blend] MTBE/biodiesel \n\nBioethanol Microbial Industrial Pure/blend \n\nBiobutanol Microbial Industrial (until ca 1990) Pure/blend \n\nETBE Chemical/microbial Industrial Blend \n\nBiomethane Microbial Industrial Pure/blend \n\nBiohydrogen Microbial Laboratory Bioethanol (Syngas)/pure \n\nBiodiesel Physical/chemical (enzymatic) Industrial (laboratory) Pure/blend \n\n \n\nAlthough additional types of biofuels are being investigated, such as methane, hydrogen, n-Butanol, \n\nacetone and others, bioethanol fermentation is by far the largest scale microbial process, with a strong \n\nhistory of productivity in several countries (Antoni et al., 2007). The fermented beverages produced \n\nthrough yeast\u2019s activities have contributed significantly to the worldwide advancement and sustainability \n\nof human societies (Legras et al., 2007). Bioethanol does not need to be rectified to high purity, being \n\ndirectly used in Brazil as AEHC (\u00c1lcool Et\u00edlico Hidratado Combust\u00edvel) (Antoni et al., 2007). Given the \n\nappropriate chemical characteristics of bioethanol as a liquid fuel for current engines, it is the most used \n\nbiofuel worldwide. \n\n1.2. Bioethanol \n\nEthanol can be produced synthetically from petrochemical materials (crude oil, gas or coal) or \n\nbiologically by fermentation of sugars (bioethanol). In 1995, only 7% of world ethanol was produced by \n\nthe synthetic method, the remaining 93% was produced by microbial fermentation (K\u00e1d\u00e1r, 2005). \n\nBioethanol as a biofuel regained importance in the 1970s, caused by a gasoline depletion which made \n\nthe costs increase tremendously. Brazil was the first country to approve governmental support to \n\nimplement bioethanol as current biofuel in that decade (Goldemberg, 2007). Today, the USA and EU \n\nhave defined political objectives for increasing the use of bioethanol as alternative to fossil fuel, namely: \n\nin the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and the European Commission White Paper, \n\nrespectively. In 2010, the USA was responsible for 57% of global bioethanol production and Brazil \n\ncontributed with almost 31%. The third producer worldwide was China, representing 2.3%. The global \n\nproduction of fuel ethanol reached 86 billion liters, an increase of 17% over 2009 (REN21). In Table 2 are \n\ndescribed the main feedstocks used for bioethanol production. Bioethanol is mainly produced from two \n\ntypes of feedstocks: sugar and starch rich biomass. Sugar can be used for direct fermentation of ethanol. \n\nSugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) are the major sugar-producing plants. \n\nSugarcane is adapted to warm temperate to tropical areas, used in Brazil, whereas sugar beet is grown in \n\ntemperate areas, mainly in Europe. Therefore the two sugar crops occupy different geographical niches \n\n(Yuan et al., 2008a). In the USA, corn (Zea mays L.) is the starch source for bioethanol production. For \n\nthe alcoholic fermentation process, a saccharification step (conversion of polymers, like starch, into \n\nsimple sugars) is required prior to its industrial batch. \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 2. Bio-ethanol production and land use by major producing countries, 2006/07 (adapted from Balat and Balat, 2009). \n\nCountry \nFeedstocks \n\nused \nEthanol yield \n\n(l/hectare) \nFeedstock \nshare (%) \n\nArable land \n(Million hectare) \n\nTotal \narea \n\nImplied \nfeedstock area \n\nBrazil Sugar cane 6641 100 59 2.99 \n\nUSA Corn 3770 98 174 6.35 \n\n Sorghum 1365 2 - 0.28 \n\nChina Corn 2011 70 143 0.65 \n\n Wheat 1730 30 - 0.32 \n\nEU-27 Wheat 1702 48 114 0.53 \n\n Sugar beet 5145 29 - 0.12 \n\nCanada Corn 3460 70 46 0.12 \n\n Wheat 1075 30 - 0.16 \n\n \n\nThe bioethanol produced exclusively from crops that use farmland is named 1\nst\n Generation \n\nBioethanol (1G). The use of edible crops and farmland has raised morality and ethics issues, since fuel is \n\ndirectly competing with food resources. In order to overcome this issue, bioethanol produced from \n\nlignocellulosic biomass (e.g. trees, forestry and crop residue, grasses, and municipal solid waste), named \n\n2\nnd\n\n Generation Bioethanol (2G), offers a great option which is compatible with economic growth and \n\nmorality issues (Luo et al., 2009). The lignocellulosic biomass represents an enormous carbon source for \n\nbioconversion, with an estimated annual production of 1 366 million tons from forest biomass and \n\nagricultural residue just in the USA (Gibbons and Hughes, 2009). The monomers retrieved after specific \n\ntreatment (acid or enzymatic hydrolysis) from the lignocellulosic biomass are pentoses (C5), as xylose \n\nand arabinose (sugars from hemicelluloses, xylan and lignin fibers), and hexoses (C6), as glucose (sugar \n\nfrom cellulose fibers). In order to use this biomass for bioethanol, the fermentation requires four main \n\nsteps: enzyme production, biomass enzymatic hydrolysis, hexose and pentose fermentations (Lynd, \n\n1996). The main objective is the utilization of all sugar content, both C6 and C5 sugars alike. The C6 \n\nsugars are used for ethanol production at high yield, however the C5 fermentation requires specific \n\nmicroorganisms which have by-product formation or slow xylose conversion limiting the economical \n\napplication for ethanol production (K\u00f6tter and Ciriacy, 1993). The four processes for conversion of \n\nlignocellulosic biomass into ethanol are compared in Figure 1. The methodologies are displayed from the \n\nless (Separate Hydrolysis Fermentation - SHF) to the most integrated bioprocess (Consolidated \n\nBioProcessing - CBP). The enzyme cost and production is still the bottleneck for the industrial application \n\nof these approaches.  \n\nThrough SHF process, the four necessary fermentation steps occur separately. It is the simplest \n\nprocess. The C5 and C6 sugars fermentation may occur in sequence (Figure 1A) or be allocated in \n\nparallel (Figure 1B).  \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Levels of consolidation in enzyme production, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to bioethanol (adapted from \n\nHamelinck et al., 2005). \n\nFor the Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF), the ethanol production co-occurs with \n\nthe enzymatic hydrolysis, diminishing the procedure to three different fermentation batches. This avoids \n\nthe problem of product inhibition associated with enzymes, given that the monomers enzymatically \n\nproduced are consumed by the ethanologenic microorganism (usually S. cerevisiae). The Simultaneous \n\nSaccharification and Co Fermentation (SSCF) process refers to the joining of C6 and C5 fermentation \n\nstep with simultaneous hydrolysis, which reduces to two fermentation batches.  \n\nThe most integrated system is the Consolidated BioProcessing (CBP) which occurs in a single batch \n\nat the same time. It is the best conceptual design, although no organism or compatible combination of \n\nmicroorganisms is available that produces the desired enzymatic machinery and also produce ethanol at \n\nthe necessary high concentration and yield (Lynd, 1996).  \n\nAccording to the following reactions, the ethanol theoretical maximum yield is 0.51 kg ethanol and \n\n0.49 kg carbon dioxide per kg of sugar (Hamelinck et al., 2005): \n\n \n\n3 C5H10O5 -> 5C2H6O + 5CO2  (1) \n\nC6H12O6 -> 2C2H6O + 2CO2  (2) \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCurrently, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the main producer of 1G trough C6 fermentation (2), due to \n\nhigh ethanol concentration production from glucose and sucrose, and also due to high ethanol tolerance \n\n(Hirasawa et al., 2007; Abe et al., 2009). However, the pentose\u2019s fermentation (1) requires the utilization \n\nof C5 fermenting microorganisms, as Zymomonas mobilis, or recombinant S. cerevisiae strains \n\n(Hamelinck et al., 2005). \n\nUnfortunately, several technical drawbacks still hinder industrial application of 2G, by comparison with \n\n1G: the feedstock typically contains little protein or other nutrients (besides carbohydrates) that microbes \n\nwill need; hence, nutrient supplementation may be required; improvements are needed to reduce \n\nbiomass harvest and transportation costs; the lignocellulosic residue pretreatment are costly and often \n\nsufficiently intensive to generate inhibitory compounds that inhibit microbial growth; current \n\ndeconstructing enzymes are more expensive and less effective than corresponding enzymes used with \n\nstarch; the fermentation of both C5 and C6 reduces ethanol conversion efficiency; the currently used \n\nethanologenic microbes lack tolerance to inhibitors generated during lignocellulose pretreatment, cannot \n\nferment mixed sugars and cannot operate at the 50-60\u00b0C optimal temperature of the saccharification \n\nenzymes; finally, the engineered microbes that ferment mixed sugars may require regulatory approval \n\nand possess sufficient robustness to industrial conditions, high sugar and ethanol concentrations, and \n\nother variables (Gibbons and Hughes, 2009). \n\nGiven all these obstacles for implementing an industrial scale 2G production, and concerns about soil \n\nusage, environment impact and carbon cycle, a 3\nrd\n\n Generation Bioethanol (3G) was created. The 3G is \n\nbased on an equilibrated carbon network that does not compete with agriculture (Goh and Lee, 2010). \n\nThis 3G technology is based on algae or cyanobacteria that contain a high oil mass fraction grown in \n\nponds. Microorganisms can convert almost all of the energy in biomass residuals and subsequently in \n\nbioethanol (Singh et al., 2011). The process of algal cultivation could be improved for higher yield \n\nefficiency of algal lipids through the screening and improvement of algal strains. Wastewater and flue \n\ngases are the best options for reducing the environmental burden from the cultivation of algal biomass. \n\nFurther research and development are necessary to establish an economical industrial scale production \n\nof algal biofuels (Singh et al., 2011) due to low yield and biomass concentration, when compared with \n\nother bioethanol productions. \n\nThe availability of inexpensive sources of fermentable sugar is limited in most areas of the world, and \n\nthe efficient conversion of cellulosic biomass or other inexpensive substrate sources to usable fuels will \n\nbe required to increase the bioethanol production. The 3G requires further advances and an industrial \n\nscale application. The primary limitation in cellulosic biomass fermentation is the yeasts inability to directly \n\nconvert cellulose, hemicelluloses and associated components into ethanol (Hahn-H\u00e4gerdal et al., 2006). \n\nAn alternative to these options are inulin containing plants, representing a renewable, inexpensive and \n\nabundant raw material for industry and bioethanol production (Neagu and Bahrim, 2011; Chi et al., 2011; \n\nBajpai and Margaritis, 1982). \n\n1.2.1. Inulin and inulin rich materials \n\nFructans are one of the most abundant non-structural polysaccharides found in a wide range of \n\nplants. Inulin is a polydisperse fructan polymer composed by linear chains of ?-2, 1-linked D-\n\nfructofuranose molecules terminated by a glucose residue through a sucrose-type linkage at the reducing \n\n\n\n6 \n\nend (De Leenheer, 1996). Thus, inulin is a mixture of oligomers and polymers. The degree of \n\npolymerization (DP) in inulin varies according to plant species, weather conditions and age (Li and Chan-\n\nHalbrendt, 2009), ranging from 2 to 60 fructose monomers, or higher (Sirisansaneeyakul et al., 2007; Yu \n\net al., 2011). The molecular structure of inulin compounds is shown in Figure 2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Molecular structure of inulin (from Vandamme and Derycke, 1983). \n\nAs a result, inulin is of great interest as it is a relatively inexpensive and abundant substrate for the \n\nproduction of fructose syrups and bioethanol (Bonciu et al., 2010). It is present as a reserve carbohydrate \n\nin the roots and tubers of several plants, such as Jerusalem artichoke (topinambur), chicory, dahlia and \n\nyacon (see Table 3).  The inulin content depends on the plant species, being chicory, Jerusalem \n\nartichoke and dahlia the major sources of inulin for industrial scale with world production currently \n\nestimated to be about 350 000 tons (Kango and Jain, 2011). \n\nNowadays, inulin has gain interest for high fructose syrup, a low calorie sweetener, or inulo-\n\noligosaccharides (IOS) synthesis, a functional food (Roberfroid, 2005), for the neutraceutical industry and \n\nfor bioethanol production from renewable carbon sources. Briefly, inulin polymers have multiple industries \n\napplication and potentially high relevance for our live. However, further advances are still required to \n\nassure a sustainable and profitable system. \n\nInulin can be actively hydrolyzed by microbial inulinases (fructofuranosyl hydrolases) to produce \n\ninulo-oligosaccharides (IOS), glucose and fructose as main products. In Figure 3 are illustrated the \n\ndifferent inulinases activities, which can be divided into exo- and endo-acting enzymes according to the \n\neffect over the inulin. Endoinulinases (EC 3.2.1.7) are specific for inulin and can hydrolyze the internal ?-\n\n2, 1-fructofuranosidic linkages to yield IOS, which are inulin chains with DP from 2 to 7 (Nguyen et al., \n\n2011). \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 3. Inulin content of some plants (withdraw from Kango and Jain, 2011). \n\nSource Plant part \n% of Inulin content \n\n(fresh weight) \n\nOnion Bulb 2 - 6 \n\nJerusalem artichoke Tuber 14 - 19 \n\nDahlia Tuber      9 - 12.5 \n\nChicory Root 15 - 20 \n\nLeek Bulb   3 - 10 \n\nGarlic Bulb   9 - 16 \n\nArtichoke Leaves-heart   3 - 10 \n\nBanana Fruit 0.3 - 0.7 \n\nRye Cereal 0.5 - 1.0 \n\nBarley Cereal 0.5 - 1.5 \n\nDandelion Leaves 12 - 15 \n\nBurdock Root 3.5 - 4.0 \n\nCamas Bulb 12 - 22 \n\nMurnong Tuber   8 - 13 \n\nYacon Tuber   3 - 19 \n\nSalsify Tuber   4 - 11 \n\n \n\n1.2.1.1. Inulinases \n\nThe IOS have high applicability in the food industry, like confectionery, fruit preparations, milk \n\ndesserts, yogurt and fresh cheese, as a functional food, with positive effects described as dietary fiber \n\n(Kaur and Gupta, 2002; Roberfroid, 2005). These features have increased the attention towards \n\nendoinulinase and their commercial application. Exoinulinases (EC 3.2.1.153) split off terminal fructose \n\nunits from the non-reducing end of inulin, and also hydrolyze the disaccharide, sucrose, and the \n\ntrisaccharide, raffinose (Yuan et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Microbial exo- and endoinulinase enzymes action. The action of exoinulinase liberates fructose from the macromolecule \n\nwhile endoinulinase produces IOS. (Figure adapted from Kango and Jain, 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nA number of microorganisms including molds, yeasts, actinomycetes and other bacteria are known to \n\nproduce inulin hydrolyzing enzymes (Vandamme and Derycke, 1983; Pandey et al., 1999; Singh and Gill, \n\n2006). Among the molds group, Aspergillus and Penicillium are the prominent genera, for bacteria the \n\nmost promising producers include species of Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas, while Kluyveromyces \n\ngenera is the most exploited yeast group for inulinase production, as summarized by Kango and Jain \n\n(2011). Over 35 inulinases have been characterized, from different microbial strains isolated from very \n\ndifferent location. Several fungi and yeasts species of Aspergillus and Kluyveromyces genera have been \n\nused for inulinase production and gene characterization. Enzymes produced by most of strains are \n\nextracellular in nature (Pandey et al., 1999), however some authors reported as high as 50% and 75% of \n\nenzyme activity to be cell-associated (Rouwenhorst et al., 1991; Parekh and Margaritis, 1986).  \n\nTypically, exoinulinases present an invertase activity due to wide substrate specificity; therefore the \n\nclassification of enzymatic activity depends on an activity ratio between invertase/ inulinase (I/S). Kangoo \n\nand Jain in 2011 considered the limit of 1 for the I/S ratio enough to separate inulinases from invertases, \n\nalthough Guiraud (1981) assumed different values: for inulinase the I/S ratio should be higher than 10\n-2\n\n, \n\nwhile for invertase the ratio values should be lower than I0\n-4\n\n.  \n\nInulinases are key enzymes for inulin based bioprocesses to occur hence described microorganisms \n\ncannot use this polymer without previous hydrolysis. Concerning the application of inulin for \n\nbioprocesses, the most desirable condition is the mix production of exo- and endo inulolytic enzymes, \n\nwhich results in total inulin hydrolysis into, mostly, fructose (Fru) and some glucose (Glu). The resulting \n\nratio [Fru/Glu] depends on the initial inulin DP level. Afterwards the sugar rich hydrolysate can be used for \n\nbioprocesses as carbon source, retrieved from a natural, inexpensive and ecological source.  \n\nIt is described that enzymatic inulin hydrolysis can reach yields up to 95% of fructose in high fructose \n\nsyrups (HFS) (Ettalibi and Baratti, 2001; Makino et al., 2009). Inulin can also be hydrolyzed by acid \n\ntreatment (pH=1.0 - 2.0 at 80 - 100 \u00b0C), but low pH results in degradation of fructose and the process also \n\ngives rise to difructose anhydrides, an inhibitory compound for bioprocesses. Therefore, enzymatically \n\nhydrolyzed inulin is an important substrate, with high potential for HFS production for nutritional industry \n\nand for bioethanol production.  \n\n1.2.1.2. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) \n\nThe Jerusalem artichoke is a warm-season crop, native of North America and it has been grown to \n\nproduce fructans that can be used for ethanol production, human-diet or medical and industrial \n\napplications (Meijer and Mathijssen, 1993). This interesting perennial tuberous plant belongs to the \n\nAsteraceae family and develops potato-like reserve tuberous with high inulin content (Table 3) when \n\nharvested at the appropriate season. Jerusalem artichoke has many desirable growing traits such as cold \n\nand drought tolerance, wind and sand resistance, saline tolerance, strong fecundity and high pest and \n\ndisease resistance and does not require soil fertility (Zhang et al., 2010; Negro et al., 2006). The growth \n\nof Jerusalem artichoke with saline aquaculture wastewater (Gengmao et al., 2010) is a demonstration of \n\nthis plant\u2019s potential as a renewable carbon source which can be produced without direct competition with \n\narable soil and using a wastewater flow.  \n\nIn the last years, many researchers and governments in the world, especially in developing countries, \n\nhave been interested in using non-food grains as the materials in bioprocesses (e.g. bioethanol \n\n\n\n9 \n\nproduction) due to the shortage of food grain, its high price and grain insecurity worldwide (Li and Chan-\n\nHalbrendt, 2009). In this context, inulin rich materials have gain importance as carbohydrates source for \n\nbioprocesses over the majority of food grains, such as starch-containing materials (Chi et al., 2001). \n\nThus, inulin and inulin containing plants, such as Jerusalem artichoke, are promising substrates to use in \n\nbioprocesses, if the industrial bases are set up: development of resistant and rentable inulinase \n\nproduction; selection of efficient microbial strains and design of an economically viable bioprocess. \n\nHence, Jerusalem artichoke, an inulin rich material, is one of the most interesting sources among \n\nunconventional and renewable raw materials, due to the high production of fermentable sugars (glucose \n\nand fructose) that can be used for several applications (e.g. nutritional industry, bioethanol production) \n\nand as a low cost alternative to purified inulin.  \n\nResearchers have studied the bioethanol production from Jerusalem artichoke tubers. While some \n\nconsider the SSF approach as the most applicable, where a highly ethanologenic yeast strain of S. \n\ncerevisiae and the fungi Aspergillus niger are joined to ferment the raw substrate in the same \n\nfermentation batch (Nakamura et al., 1996; Ohta et al., 1993); others studied the SHF approach using a \n\nyeast strain of S. cerevisiae (Zhang et al., 2010), or the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis (Onsoy et al., \n\n2007) or even a mix of Z. mobilis, S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces fragilis (Szambelan et al., 2004) for \n\nbioethanol production. The co-culture of different species for ethanol and enzyme production is difficult to \n\nbe optimized due to different physiological conditions for the used species. Therefore to achieved a \n\nhigher integrated bioethanol production system, yeasts capable of hydrolyzing inulin and produce ethanol \n\nlike K. marxianus have been used directly with Jerusalem artichoke juice (Yuan et al., 2011; Yuan et al., \n\n2008b; Bajpai and Margaritis, 1986), although with a low bioethanol yield. Strains of S. cerevisiae have \n\nbeen reported to directly utilize Jerusalem artichoke juice, again, with the production of low ethanol \n\nconcentration (Lim et al., 2011). In addition, the Jerusalem artichoke tubers have been proposed as \n\ncarbon source for different bioprocesses for production of value-added products such as: L-lactic acid, \n\n2,3-butanediol, lipids, single-cell protein and single cell oil (Ge et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2009; Zhao et al., \n\n2010; Gao et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2011).  \n\n1.3. Microbial isolation and characterization  \n\nCurrently, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is the main producer of industrial bioethanol due to its \n\nhigh ethanol concentration production from glucose and sucrose and its high ethanol tolerance. However, \n\nseveral drawbacks limit the use of this yeast in the design of high efficient industrial bioprocesses for \n\nbioethanol production from renewable and inexpensive biomass (e.g. lignocellulosic or inulin-rich \n\nmaterials), such as: unavailability of the necessary enzymatic machinery, inability to ferment C5 \n\ncompounds (e.g. xilose) and intolerance to high temperatures. For these reasons is unfeasible to perform \n\na consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), where the whole process occurs in one fermentation batch at the \n\nsame time. \n\nIn this context, the screening and isolation of new microorganisms, mainly novel yeasts, presenting \n\ninnovative characteristics, is crucial. Features such as higher thermotolerance, higher tolerance to \n\nethanol and other inhibitors, and ability of produce the entire hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. xylanases and \n\ncellulases, inulinases, amylases, etc) are imperative to develop a CBP for bioethanol production. The \n\nCBP is the best conceptual design for biofuel production given that it is the most integrated bioprocess. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nHowever, until now no microorganism or compatible combination of microorganisms that produce the \n\nrequired enzymatic machinery and produce ethanol at the necessary high concentration and yield, is \n\navailable.  \n\n1.3.1. Yeast isolation \n\nYeasts are recovered from all habitats, aquatic, marine, atmospheric and terrestrial seldom occur \n\nwithout molds or bacteria (Kurtzman et al., 2011). Consequently, selective techniques must be used in \n\norder to recover yeasts. Employing selective media, with pH levels and/or water activities that reduce or \n\ninhibit the growth of bacteria or by inclusion of antibiotics/ fungistatic agents permits the isolation of one \n\nparticular colony. Most yeasts are mesophilic, which means the incubation temperature should be around \n\n20-25 \u00baC, although specific groups like psychrophilic require lower temperatures between 4 and 15 \u00baC. \n\nSeveral media have been designated for these purposes, with lower pH\u2019s which suppresses most \n\nbacterial growth or with addiction of antibiotics like chloramphenicol. An example is the Rose Bengal \n\nChloramphenicol Agar, used for selective isolation and enumeration of yeasts and molds from food. \n\nChloramphenicol is recommended as a selective agent in fungal medium with a neutral pH because of its \n\nheat stability and broad antibacterial spectrum (Mislivec et al., 1992). The Rose Bengal dye has also \n\nknown cytotoxic effects on bacterial species (Banks et al., 1985), increasing the selectivity of the medium \n\ntowards yeasts. \n\n1.3.2. Characterization by classical biochemical tests \n\nThe classical methods used for microbial identification are culture-dependent methods based on \n\nmorphological and physiological tests which require microorganisms to be isolated and cultivated prior to \n\nidentification. Today, we live the era of microbial strain identification by gene sequencing, which as shown \n\nto be faster and more accurate than classical methods (Kurtzman et al., 2011). However, morphological \n\nand physiological properties must be reported in order to describe the general biological properties of the \n\nspecies. These features are of extreme importance, since they refer to the phenotypic characteristics of \n\nstrains, crucial information for biotechnological purposes. The physiological tests commonly used for \n\nidentification are carbohydrates fermentation, growth on various carbon and nitrogen sources, growth at \n\ndifferent temperatures or on media with high content sugar or sodium chloride. However, these are time \n\nconsuming and laborious methods and automated diagnostic systems have been developed for rapid \n\nmicrobial identification. Initially design for clinical purposes, these systems are applied for yeasts \n\nidentification with relative success, since they support in growth reactions. The most used systems are \n\nthe API (Analytical Profile Index) System, Biolog and Vitek cards. The identification capacity of these \n\nsystems depends on the size of the corresponding database, which in the case of yeasts species is very \n\nincomplete. \n\n1.3.3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization \n\nThe Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a molecular method based on the hybridization of \n\nsynthetic fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes targeted to specific regions of the ribosomal RNA \n\n(rRNA) of a microorganism. The fluorescently-labeled FISH-probes enter inside the cells and hybridize \n\nwith the rRNA target-sequence that is complementary to the cDNA sequence of the probe, emitting a \n\nfluorescent signal that allows the visualization of the intact cell by epifluorescence microscopy (Amann \n\n\n\n11 \n\nand Fuchs, 2008). Since FISH is a culture-independent method that allows the identification of specific \n\nmicrobial species at the single-cell level, it has been considered as the most powerful method for various \n\napplications in microbiology (Amann and Fuchs, 2008). \n\nA typical FISH protocol using rRNA-targeted oligonucleotides probes includes four steps: fixation and \n\npermeabilization, hybridization, washing, visualization and/or quantification of hybridized cells by \n\nepifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry (see Figure 4). First, the microbial cells are permeabilized \n\nto allow penetration of the fluorescent probes into the cell and then fixed to protect RNA from degradation \n\nby endogenous RNAses. Afterwards, the fluorescently labeled FISH-probes are added to the fixed cells \n\nand allowed to hybridize with the targeted-sequence by incubating the mixture at temperatures of about \n\n46-60 \u00baC during several hours, typically three hours (Moter and Gobel, 2000; Amman and Fuchs, 2008). \n\nAfter hybridization, a washing step is carried out to remove unbound probe. \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Basic steps of fluorescent in situ hybridization (withdrawn from Amann and Fuchs, 2008). \n\nApplying the FISH procedure requires the design of species-specific probes able to hybridize with the \n\ntargeted sequence. The RNA molecules that constitute the ribosome (small 16S/18S and large 23S/26S \n\nsubunits) meet most of the characteristics required to choose as target-sequence: they are present in all \n\ncellular organisms; they are genetically stable containing variable and conserved regions; they exist in \n\nhigh numbers in metabolically active cells, which means that there are sufficient targets inside a single \n\ncell to allow its visualization; there is a high number of RNA sequences available in public databases (e.g. \n\nGenBank), which allows the design of species-specific probes through the alignment and comparison of \n\nsequences for different species. In yeasts, the D1/D2 domains of 26S rRNA exhibits a high degree of \n\ninterspecies sequence variation, and consequently has been used for many phylogenetic and \n\nidentification studies (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998; Fell et al., 2000). The general features to consider in \n\nthe designing of a FISH-probe are: specificity, taking into account dimension, the number of nucleotides \n\n\n\n12 \n\nthat differentiate it from phylogenetically-close species and its composition; ability to penetrate the cell \n\nand accessibility to the rRNA region where the target-sequence is located. The oligonucleotides probes \n\nused in FISH are generally 15 to 20 nucleotides long and have a fluorescent dye covalently linked to its \n\nterminal 5\u2019-end. The most commonly used fluorescent dyes to label oligonucleotides probes are: \n\nfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), carbocyanine (Cy3, Cy5 and Cy7) \n\nand tetramethylrhodamine-isotiocianate (TRICT) (Amann et al., 2001). \n\nIn situ identification of individual cells by FISH may be hindered by low cellular ribosome content, \n\nlimited cell wall permeability and inaccessibility of the probe to the target sites of the rRNA, mainly due to \n\nstructural issues (Bidnenko et al., 1998; Binder and Liu, 1998; Fuchs et al., 1998; In\u00e1cio et al., 2003). \n\nInaccessibility of the probes to the target regions of rRNA is usually caused by molecular interactions \n\n(rRNA-rRNA and rRNA-protein) in which the target region of the ribosome is involved (Amann et al., \n\n1995). To overcome the target site inaccessibility, Fuchs et al. (2000) evaluated the potential of several \n\nunlabeled helper oligonucleotides, which bind adjacent to the probe target site, in order to increase weak \n\nprobe hybridization signals in Escherichia coli DSM 30083T. Their results suggested that by the joint \n\naction of multiple adjacent helper oligonucleotides, every site on the rRNA could be opened for FISH. \n\nIn\u00e1cio et al. (2003) evaluated the accessibility of fluorescently labeled probes to the D1/D2 domains of the \n\n26S rRNA of S. cerevisiae and designed an accessibility map for this species. Based on this accessibility \n\nmap, Xufre (2005) designed species-specific FISH-probes that allowed the monitorization of the \n\npopulation evolution of several yeast species (i.e. Hanseniaspora uvarum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, \n\nLachancea thermotolerans, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Torulaspora \n\ndelbrueckii and Zygosaccharomyces bailii) during industrial and laboratory wine fermentations. \n\nIn this work, the probes of Xufre (2005) were used in FISH assays for a preliminary molecular method \n\nfor a species putative identification of the selected novel yeast isolates presenting potential for bioethanol \n\nproduction. \n\n1.4. Scope of the thesis \n\nThe main goal of this work was to search for novel microbial strains, in special new yeasts, with high \n\npotential to produce bioethanol, due to either the presence of better ethanologenic characteristics (e. g. \n\nhigh tolerance to ethanol concentration, extremes pH and/or temperature; ability to perform long term \n\nfermentations) or production of relevant hydrolytic enzymatic machinery, which can be competitive in \n\nfurther application for industrial bioprocesses.  \n\nAll the novel yeasts strains isolated which presented interesting characteristics for further application \n\nin a biofuel production process were characterized using classical biochemical methods and the \n\nfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, as a preliminary molecular approach for the putative \n\nidentification of the selected isolates. \n\nIn addition, novel inulinases produced by a promising selected yeast isolate, were also applied for \n\nbioethanol production in a consolidated bioprocess (CBP), and in a Simultaneous Saccharification and \n\nFermentation (SSF) process, using inulin and inulin rich materials as carbon source. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n2.1. Isolation of novel microorganisms \n\nDifferent fruits with high levels of fermentable sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) were chosen as \n\nnatural isolation sources, namely: carob (Ceratonia s\u00edliqua) pulp kibbles, cherry (Prunus avium), fig (Ficus \n\ncarica), Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) tubers, peach (Prunus persica), plum (Prunus \n\ndomestica) and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) fruits. The cherries, figs, peaches and plums were \n\ncollected from the Portuguese west region (Torres Vedras, Portugal), while Jerusalem artichoke tubers \n\nand strawberry tree fruits were harvest from the north region (Oleiros, Portugal) and the carob pulp \n\nkibbles were from the south region (Faro, Portugal). Each fruit was mashed into a homogeneous pulp. \n\nFor carob pulp kibbles and Jerusalem artichoke tubers, a pre-enrichment step was performed, inoculating \n\n1% (w/v) of each pulp in 100 ml shake flasks containing 25 ml of tryptone soy broth (TSB; Oxoid, \n\nSwitzerland). The flasks were incubated in a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 25 \u00baC for 48 h, for microbial \n\nenrichment. For the other fruits, the pulp itself was used for the isolation procedure. \n\n2.1.1. Isolation procedure \n\nThe microorganisms were isolated by decimal serial dilution of the pulps (dilution factor ranging from  \n\n-4 to -7), pre-enriched or not, and plated on rose bengal chloramphenicol agar (RBC; Merck, Germany) \n\nthrough standard spread plate method. All plates were incubated at 25 \u00baC for 3 to 5 days. After \n\nincubation, individualized and morphologically different colonies (yeast or bacterium like) were selected \n\nand purified on yeast malt agar (YMA; Scharlau, Spain) plates. For purification, each isolate was \n\ntransferred at least three times. The isolates were maintained on YMA slants at 4 \u00baC and sub-cultured \n\nmonthly for laboratory routine. All isolates were also maintained at -25 \u00baC by addition of 30% (v/v) glicerol \n\nto previously grown cultures in yeast malt broth (YMB; Sigma, USA). \n\n2.2. Alcoholic fermentation screening \n\nThe microbial isolates were previously inoculated in test tubes containing 5 ml of sterilized YMB \n\nmedium and incubated for 2 - 3 days at 25 \u00baC without shaking, for inocula production. An aliquot (130 ?l) \n\nof each inoculum was then transferred to a 16 cm test tube containing an invert Durham tube in 10 - 12 \n\nml of a sterilized liquid medium with 0.5% (w/v) of yeast extract and the tested carbon source (50 mM \n\narabinose, fructose, glucose, xylose, cellobiose, lactose or sucrose and 8.5 g/l inulin). For blank controls, \n\nan aliquot of each inoculum was transferred to a 16 cm test tube containing an invert Durham tube in 10 - \n\n12 ml of liquid medium with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract but without any carbon source. After 7 days of \n\nincubation at 25 \u00baC without shaking, all tubes were observed for growth density and gas formation  inside \n\nthe invert Durham tube, as an indicator of alcoholic fermentation ability.  \n\nFor the strawberry tree fruits\u2019 isolates, this method was adapted to test their ability to use the \n\nstrawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice (STFJ) as substrate to alcoholic fermentation. In this case, the liquid medium \n\nwithin the test tubes consisted on 10 - 12 ml of non-sterile pure STFJ. The test tubes were incubated at \n\n25 \u00baC without shaking and the growth and gas formation were observed after 3 and 7 days. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n2.3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) \n\n2.3.1. Oligonucleotide probes \n\nIn this work were used the oligonucleotides probes for Hanseniaspora uvarum (Huv), Kluyveromyces \n\nmarxianus (Kma), Lachancea thermotolerans (Lth), Metschnikowia pulcherrima (Mpu), Saccharomyces \n\ncerevisiae (Sce), Torulaspora delbrueckii (Tde), Zygosaccharomyces bailii (Zba) and for eukaryotic cells \n\n(EUK516). These probes were those previously designated by Xufre (2005); with exception for the \n\nEUK516 probe, which was design by Amann et al. (1990). The specie-specific FISH probes are formed \n\nby 17-19 nucleotides and targeted the D1-D2 domain of the 26S ribosomal RNA (Table 4). The probes \n\nwere synthesized and labeled with the fluorochrome Fluorescein IsoThioCyanate (FITC) at the 5\u2019-end.  \n\nTable 4.

FISH procedure \n\n2.3.2.1. Silanization  \n\nThe acetone resistant glass slides used (Slides for Immunofluorescence, bioM\u00e9rieux, France) \n\npresented 10 circles (6 mm diameter) and were silanized to facilitate the hybridization protocol. The \n\nsilanization was carried out as follows: slides were emerged in absolute ethanol for 1 h, and carefully \n\ndried after washed with Milli-Q water. Afterwards, glass slides were submerged on 2% (v/v) bis (3-\n\ntrimethoxysilylpropyl) amine in acetone solution for 2 min. The glass slides were cleaned in acetone for 1 \n\nmin, before emerged in Milli-Q water and carefully dried for the hybridization procedures. \n\n2.3.2.2. Fixation \n\nThe FISH procedure used in this work was adapted from Xufre et al. (2006) to be used in appropriate \n\nglass slides. The fixation protocol performed consisted on: 1 ml cell growth in YMB medium for \n\napproximately 24 h was centrifuged for 5 min at 4 000 \u00d7 g. The pellet was then washed once with \n\nphosphate-buffered saline 1x (PBS 1x) (see Appendix) and then incubated with 4% (v/v) of \n\nparaformaldehyde solution in PBS 1x for 16 h at 4 \u00baC under strong agitation. Subsequently, fixed cells \n\n\n\n15 \n\nwere centrifuged for 2 min at 10 000 \u00d7 g and resuspended in 400 ?l PBS 1x and 400 ?l ethanol 98% (v/v). \n\nThe fixed cells samples were kept at -20 \u00baC until required.  \n\n2.3.2.3. Hybridization \n\nThe hybridization step involved the silanizated slides, through the following protocol: 5 ?l of fixed cells \n\nsample was dried on a circle, after 15 min at 55 \u00baC. Subsequently, 12 ?l of enzyme solution (1 mg/ml of \n\nlysozyme in PBS 1x) were add to each circle filled with fixed cells and incubated in a humidity chamber at \n\n37 \u00baC for 30 min. After washing each slide in Milli-Q water and carefully dry it, a dehydration step with \n\nincreasing ethanol concentration solutions was conducted: 2 min in 50% (v/v) ethanol solution, then 2 min \n\nin 80% (v/v) ethanol and finally 2 min in 98% (v/v) ethanol solution. For the hybridization step, 10 ?l of the \n\nhybridization solution (hybridization buffer (Appendix) together with 5 ng/ml of FITC labeled probe) was \n\ndropped in each circle. Incubation was performed at 46 \u00baC for, at least, 3 h protected from light. After \n\nhybridization, the slide was emerged in Washing Buffer (Appendix) and incubated at 48 \u00baC for 30 min. \n\nAfterward each slide was washed in Milli-Q waters and dried at 37 \u00baC. For fluorescence preservation, \n\nslides were then mounted with a drop of VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, USA) for observation \n\npurposes by epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX-60, Tokyo, Japan) with the appropriate filter for \n\nFITC wavelength.  \n\n2.3.3. Controls \n\nStrains well identified and routinely used at laboratory were used as positive controls for each FISH \n\nassay, namely: Hanseniaspora uvarum CBS 314, Kluyveromyces marxianus 516F, Lachancea \n\nthermotolerans CBS 2803, Metschnikowia pulcherrima NRRL Y-987, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI \n\n885, Torulaspora delbrueckii PYCC 4478 and Zygosaccharomyces bailii 518F.  \n\nThe yeast strain designated Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI 885 was isolated from Alentejo grape \n\nmusts (Albergaria et al., 2000) and was preserved from the previous Culture Collection of Industrial \n\nMicroorganism (CCMI) of INETI, Lisbon, Portugal. The CBS 2803 strain was also isolated from grapes, in \n\nItaly. The PYCC 4478 strain was isolated from yellow and sulfurous concentrated must beverage from \n\nAzeit\u00e3o, Portugal. The K. marxianus and the Z. bailii strains used were isolated from grape must \n\nproduced in Borba wine cellar and identified by Xufre (2005). All strains are maintained at laboratory for \n\nroutine usage. \n\nIn all FISH assays an autofluorescence control was conducted to prevent from false-positive results, \n\nwhere cells were subject to all the FISH procedure but without the addition of FITC probe. \n\n2.4. Metabolic characterization \n\nThe metabolic characterization of some selected isolates was performed using the Analytical Profile \n\nIndex (API) galleries, namely the API ZYM and API 20C AUX standard tests, according to the \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions (API\n\u00ae\n, bioM\u00e9rieux, Switzerland). The biochemical tests included in these API \n\ngalleries determine the presence of enzymatic activities (API ZYM) and the sugar assimilation profiles \n\n(API 20C AUX). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n2.4.1. API ZYM \n\nFor the selected isolates, a cell suspension was prepared from a fresh YMA slant (approximately     \n\n72 h) in an ampoule of NaCl 0.85% (w/v) medium (5 ml) to reach a cell density of 5 McFarland by \n\ncomparison with a standard. The 20 cupules of the API ZYM strips were inoculated with 65 ?l of cell \n\nsuspension each. The inoculated galleries were incubated at 30 \u00baC for 4 h. All the reactions were \n\nevaluated by direct observation, according to the standard operational procedure supplied by the \n\nmanufacturer. \n\n2.4.2. API 20 C AUX \n\nFor the selected isolates, the initial cell suspensions were prepared in 7 ml API M medium \n\n(bioM\u00e9rieux, France) to obtain a cell density of 2 McFarland. The suspensions were gently homogenized \n\nwith a pipette. The 20 cupules of API 20C AUX strips were then filled with each cell suspension, using a \n\nsterile Pasteur pipette, and incubated at 30 \u00baC. The results were registered after 48 h and 72 h of \n\nincubation, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n\n2.5. Inulinase Production \n\n2.5.1. Inulinase induction \n\nThe microbial isolates positive for inulinase activity (Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2) were previously \n\ntransferred from the YMA slant to 25 ml of YMB in 150 ml erlenmeyer flask and cultivated aerobically for \n\n24 hours at 25 \u00baC, for the inocula production. After, 10% inoculum was used to inoculate 500 ml \n\nerlenmeyer flasks containing 100 - 150 ml of the induction medium consisting of YMB supplemented with \n\n10% (v/v) inulin (90-95% inulin extracted from chicory roots; Fagron, Spain) or 25% (v/v) Jerusalem \n\nartichoke juice (JAJ), as inducer substrates. The JAJ was obtained by crushing the tubers in a juicer and \n\nrecovering the liquid. The cultures were grown by shaking at 150 rpm, 25 \u00baC for 8 days. The growth \n\nsamples were centrifuged at 5 000 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00baC for 10 min, and the supernatants were sterilized by filtration \n\nthrough 0.2 ?m membrane and kept at -20 \u00baC. The supernatants were used as the enzyme extracts for \n\nenzymatic activity determination. The assays were carried out in duplicates. \n\nMoreover, for the best inulinase producer yeast strain, a new set of assays were carried out testing a \n\nwider range of inducer substrates, from different pure inulin sources to complex raw materials. Thus, in \n\naddition to inulin from Fagron, other two inulins were also tested, namely: an inulin from Sigma (extracted \n\nfrom dahlia tubers) and an inulin from BDH chemicals (from unknown natural source). Furthermore, \n\nbesides JAJ, three new complex raw materials were also tested, namely: dahlia tubers (Dahlia spp), \n\nchard roots (Beta vulgaris L. var. cicla) and JA solid residue. The dahlia tuber is another known natural \n\nsource for inulin while the chard is an edible plant close related with sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The \n\ndahlia tubers and chard roots were grown in the laboratory campus (LNEG, Portugal) and milled before \n\nuse. In this set of assays, the induction medium consisted of YMB supplemented with 10% (w/v) of each \n\nnew inducer substrate tested. The assays were carried out in duplicates. \n\n2.5.2. Inulinase activity determination \n\nFor determination of the inulinase activity in each enzymatic extract, the amount of reducing sugars \n\nreleased from inulin hydrolysis in each reaction mixture was assayed using DNS method (Miller, 1959). \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe reaction mixtures consisted of 25 ?l of crude enzymatic extract and 975 ?l of 1% inulin in 50 mM \n\nsodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, and were incubated at 45 \u00baC for 15 min. Each reaction was immediately \n\ninactivated by putting the reaction mixtures on ice and adding 500 ?l of DNS reagent (see Appendix). \n\nSubsequently, the reaction mixtures were put in boiling water for 5 min and then cooled on ice for 5 min. \n\nThe same mixtures, but with inactivated enzyme crude extracts, were used as blank controls. All \n\nenzymatic reactions were performed in duplicates. To each reaction tube 5 ml of distilled water was \n\nadded and the absorbance was determined at 540 nm in a UV/Vis microplate spectrophotometer \n\n(Multiskan GO, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Finland) in triplicate for each reaction. Quantifications of \n\nreducing sugars were carried out using a standard curve. \n\nThe standard curve for DNS method was prepared using fructose (stock solution: 2 g/l fructose in 50 \n\nmM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5). Several dilutions of the fructose solution were prepared in a final \n\nvolume of 1 ml, as indicated in  Table 5. The 50 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 5.5 was used as blank. The \n\nreactions for standard curve were also performed in duplicates. One unit of inulinase activity (U) was \n\ndefined as the amount of enzyme responsible for the production of 1 ?mol of reducing sugar per minute \n\nunder the above conditions. \n\n Table 5.

Characterization of inulinases \n\nThe influence of temperature and pH on inulinase activity was carried out on the sterile Talf1 crude \n\nenzymatic extract. This extract was previously obtained by growing the yeast strain Talf1 in YMB \n\nsupplemented with 25% (v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice for 8 days at 25 \u00baC, with shaking (150 rpm). The \n\noptimal temperature for inulin hydrolysis by Talf1 enzymatic extract was determined by incubating the \n\ncrude extract (5 ml) at temperatures ranging from 20 to 65 \u00baC. Thermal stability data were obtained by \n\nincubating the enzyme extract (5 ml) at 30, 45 and 50 \u00baC, for different time intervals, from 3 hours to 24 \n\ndays, after which the remaining inulinase activity was determined. The effect of pH on Talf1 enzymatic \n\nextract was studied using different buffers: 50 mM sodium citrate (pHs: 3.0 - 7.0) and 50 mM Tris/HCl \n\nbuffer (pHs: 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5) (see Appendix). Data of stability to pH were also evaluated by incubating \n\nthe Talf1 crude extract adjusted to different pHs (5.5; 7.5 and 10) at 30\u00baC for different time intervals (0 - \n\n24 days), after which the remaining inulinase activity was determined. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n2.6. Bioethanol production  \n\n2.6.1. Carbon source: inulin \n\nA study for the ethanol production from inulin was performed by two bioprocesses: a consolidated \n\nbioprocessing (CBP) and a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The CBP was \n\nconducted with the yeast Talf1, a strain selected from several microbial isolates, using an Inulin \n\nFermentative Medium (see Appendix). The SSF process was carried out with the strain Saccharomyces \n\ncerevisiae CCMI 885 using the same fermentative medium, but supplemented with 5% (v/v) of Talf1 \n\nenzymatic extract (previously obtained by growing the yeast strain Talf1 in YMB supplemented with 25% \n\n(v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice, at 25 \u00baC with shaking (150 rpm) for 8 days). A control growth was also \n\nperformed with the strain S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 in the same Inulin Fermentative Medium without \n\nenzymatic extract addition. For all assays, prior inocula were prepared in YMB medium and incubated at \n\n25 \u00baC with shaking (150 rpm) for 24 h. Then, the assays for both bioprocesses were conducted in 150 ml \n\nof fermentative medium in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks, inoculated with 10% (v/v) inoculum (the \n\ncorrespondent pellet of inoculum culture centrifuged was resuspended in the medium), and incubated at \n\n25 \u00baC, without shaking, for 8 days. All the assays were carried out in triplicates except the control growth \n\nwith S. cerevisiae. Ethanol production, sugar consumption and cell growth were monitored along the \n\nbioprocess. \n\n2.6.2. Fermentative medium: Jerusalem artichoke juice \n\nUsing the same procedure as described above, the yeast strains Talf1 and S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 \n\nwere inoculated directly in pure Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) (an inulin rich raw material with \n\napproximately 130 g/l of hydrolyzable sugars), as the only nutrients source for ethanol production. The \n\nJAJ was obtained by crushing the tubers in a juicer and recovering the liquid. A CBP assay was \n\nconducted with strain Talf1 and a SSF was performed with S. cerevisiae CCMI 885, supplementing the \n\nJAJ with 5% (v/v) of the same Talf1 enzymatic extract described above. A control growth was also \n\nperformed for the S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 inoculating it in the pure JAJ, but without the enzymatic extract \n\naddition. For both bioprocesses, fresh inocula were prior prepared as above described and 10% (v/v) of \n\ninocula (correspondent pellet) were used to inoculate the respective fermentative broth (150 ml) in 500 ml \n\nerlenmeyer flasks, and incubated at 25 \u00baC, without shaking, for 8 days. The assays were carried out in \n\ntriplicates, except the control growth with S. cerevisiae. Ethanol production, sugar consumption and cell \n\ngrowth were monitored along the bioprocess.  \n\n2.6.3. Fermentative medium: strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice \n\nFive simultaneous fermentations of pure strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice, as the only nutrients source, were \n\nconducted for the ethanol production, using 4 selected yeasts strains isolated from strawberry tree fruits \n\n(AP1, DP2, GerP3 and GluP4) and the strain S. cerevisiae CCMI 885. Each inoculum was prior grown in \n\n50 ml of YMB medium in 150 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, at 25 \u00baC with shaking (150 rpm) for approximately   \n\n24 h. Then, the fermentation assays were carried out in 150 ml of pure strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice in 500 \n\nml shake flasks, inoculated respectively with 10% (v/v) of centrifuged inoculum, incubated at 25 \u00baC, \n\nwithout shaking, for 9 days. The strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice was obtained by crushing the fruits into a \n\n\n\n19 \n\nhomogenous pulp and centrifuged at 4 000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The liquid phase was used as the fermentative \n\nmedium without further treatment. All assays were carried out in duplicates. The ethanol production, \n\nsugar consumption and cell growth were monitored along the fermentation processes. \n\n2.7. Analytical Methods \n\nThe cell growth was monitored by measurement the optical density (OD) of culture broth samples at \n\n600 nm, using a spectrophotometer (Genesys 20, Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). The maximum \n\ngrowth rates (?max) were calculated trought lineat regression of the 3 first ponts of exponencial phase, \n\nusing Excel software (Microsoft\n\u00ae\n Office Excel\n\n\u00ae\n, 2007 for Windows). \n\nSugars and ethanol concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography \n\n(HPLC) using a Waters Sugar-Pak I column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) operating at 75 \u00baC with Ca-\n\nEDTA at 50 mg/l as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. \n\nIn the batch fermentations for bioethanol production from inulin, the remaining amount of inulin in the \n\nfermentative broths at the end of the assays (unhydrolyzed inulin by inulinases) was quantified by \n\nperforming an acid hydrolysis of the inulin present in each broth sample. These hydrolyses were carried \n\nout incubating the samples at 55 \u00baC and pH 2 for 96 h. The respective hydrolysates were then analyzed \n\nfor sugar content by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) operating at \n\n50 \u00baC with 5 mM H2SO4 as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\n3. Results and Discussion \n\n3.1. Isolation of novel microorganisms \n\nThe isolation of novel microorganisms was performed from 7 different natural sources, namely, carob \n\nkibbles, cherries, figs, Jerusalem artichoke tubers, peaches, plums and strawberry tree fruits (STF), which \n\nwere chosen due its high content in fermentable sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) and/or \n\npolysaccharides (inulin), a favorable habitat for ethanologenic yeasts and bacteria. The STF was also \n\nchosen by the special environment of its natural fermentation, which occurs in a very unique environment, \n\ntaking much more time and with much less water content than the wine fermentation processes \n\n(Soufleros et al., 2005). A total of 98 new microorganisms were collected: 90 yeasts and 8 bacteria (Table \n\n6). As the main goal was to isolate yeasts, it was used the RBC medium for the isolation procedure \n\nbecause it is a selective medium, i. e. the presence of chloramphenicol (a broad-spectrum antibiotic \n\ninhibitory to a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria) and Rose Bengal (shown by \n\nSmith et al. (1944) to inhibit bacterial growth and restrict the growth of fast growing molds) in the medium \n\ndecreased the possibility of collecting bacteria. RCB is also a differential medium due to the presence of \n\nthe pigment Rose Bengal that can be differently assimilated by colonies, conferring them different colors. \n\nDespite the RBC influence, only bacteria (7) were isolated from Jerusalem artichoke tubers. Unlike the \n\nother materials used, the tubers are very close to the soil (a known source of bacterial species and a \n\nharsh environment for yeast species) which may explain the absence of yeasts collected and strong \n\nbacterial presence. \n\n  Table 6.

Screening for alcoholic fermentation ability \n\nTo assess the potential ability of the novel 98 microbial isolates for alcoholic fermentation, simple \n\nphysiological tests were conducted in test tubes using the invert Durham tube method. The potential for \n\nthe ethanol production was evaluated for 9 different carbon sources: simple sugars (arabinose, fructose, \n\nglucose and xylose), disaccharides (cellobiose, lactose and sucrose), a polymer (inulin) and complex raw \n\nmaterial (strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice, STFJ) (see Table 15). In Table 7 are summarized the results \n\n\n\n21 \n\naccording to natural isolation origin. The carbon sources more fermented to ethanol were glucose (83% of \n\nthe isolates), fructose (76% of isolates) and sucrose (21% of isolates), as expected. The xylose was \n\nactively converted to ethanol by 5 strains, all bacterial species (from Jerusalem artichoke tubers and \n\nSTF), and the yeast strain named XilP2 (from STF) presented a positive result for lactose fermentation, \n\nbut all of them achieved low ethanol concentration.  \n\nTable 7.

Observation of \n\ngrowth (G) and gas accumulation inside the invert Durham tubes (F) was recorded after 7 days of incubation at 25 \u00baC without \n\nshaking. Carbon source tested: arabinose (ARA), cellobiose (CEL), fructose (FRU), glucose (GLU), inulin (INU), lactose (LAC), \n\nsucrose (SUC) and xylose (XYL). The assay with pure strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice (STFJ) as complete medium is highlighted in grey.  \n\n1\nJerusalem artichoke tubers \n\n2\nStrawberry tree fruits \n\n3\nStrawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice \n\n4\nnot tested \n\n \n\nThe results with more biotechnology interest concerns the inulin fermentation, where 3 yeasts were \n\nable of both strong growth and inulin fermentation. These yeast strains, named Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2, \n\nshowed the ability for inulinase production, since the inulin hydrolysis is required for its consumption. \n\nInterestingly, the 3 strains were collected from the same natural source, the carob kibbles. The carob \n\nkibbles main component is sucrose, which may explain these results once inulinase activity is associated \n\nwith invertase activity (Kangoo and Jain, 2011). \n\nThe strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice (STFJ) was also tested as carbon source for alcoholic fermentation, \n\nwith the 30 microorganisms (29 yeasts and 1 bacterium) isolated from STF. A similar test using invert \n\nDurham tubes permitted to distinguish 4 yeasts that were capable of a rapid and strong growth with great \n\ngas liberation, associated with ethanol production, despite all microorganisms showed growth and 23 (out \n\nof 30) showed gas liberation, after 7 days of incubation (see Table 7).  \n\n\n\n22 \n\nIn overall, from this screening the most promising isolates, 7 yeast strains, were selected for further \n\nanalysis. Four strains from STF, named AP1, DP2, GerP3 and GluP4, due to their ability of rapidly use \n\nthe STFJ as only nutrient medium for alcoholic fermentation, were selected for further application in \n\nethanol production from STFJ. Moreover, 3 strains from carob kibbles, named Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2, \n\npresenting inulinase activities, were also selected due to the great interest in develop processes using \n\ninulin rich materials, like Jerusalem artichoke, for bioethanol production.  \n\n3.3. Characterization of selected isolates \n\n3.3.1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization \n\nThe molecular method FISH, widely developed as laboratory routine, was employed for the putative \n\nmolecular identification of the 7 selected yeast strains, namely: AP1, DP2, GerP3, GluP4, Talf1, Talf2 and \n\nCalf2. Using FITC marked oligonucleotide probes for 7 known yeast species, usually encountered in \n\nwinery, all strains gave a positive result for only one probe (see Table 8). Yeast strains, well identified and \n\nroutinely used were applied as positive control strains for the probes in the FISH assays. To assure the \n\npresence of rRNA molecules in the fixed cells, a positive control using a group probe for all eukaryotic \n\ncells (EUK516) was carried out, reassuring the presence and availability of rRNA molecules inside the \n\nfixed cells. \n\nAll the selected strains from carob kibbles (Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2) gave a positive result for the \n\nZygosaccharomyces bailii probe, however this should be yet confirmed using more accurate molecular \n\napproaches, such as gene sequencing. If confirmed, it will be the first Z. bailii strain with ability of \n\ninulinase production, as far as I know. The existence of a Z. bailii strain with inulinase capacity opens a \n\nnew focus of research, since this species, a known food-contaminant and associated with food spoilage, \n\nhas interesting characteristics, such as: resistance to weak-acid preservatives, extreme osmotolerance, \n\nability to adapt to high glucose concentrations and high temperatures, ability to vigorously ferment \n\nglucose, and growth at low pH (Martorell et al., 2007). In addition to the ability of inulinase production, \n\nthese are important features for a strain to be used in bioprocesses for ethanol production.  \n\nThe 4 strains collected from the strawberry tree fruits gave positive for 3 different yeast species: \n\nLachancea thermotolerans (AP1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DP2 and GluP4) and Zygosaccharomyces \n\nbailii (GerP3). The S. cerevisiae and Z. bailii species have been isolated from fruits or food spoilage and \n\nare known for ethanol tolerance and vigorous sugar fermentation capacity (Kurtzman et al., 2011). In \n\nprevious microbiological studies with strawberry tree fruit natural fermentation, yeasts from L. \n\nthermotolerans and S. cerevisiae species were also isolated (Santos et al., 2012). As described above, \n\nthese putative identifications using the FISH technique should be confirmed using more accurate \n\nmolecular methods. In addition, further morphological and physiological studies with all the selected \n\nisolates should be also carried out, as complementary characterization tests.  \n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 8.

API gallery tests revealed that all \n\nstrains presented alkaline phosphatase, esterase lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase, acid phosphatase and \n\n\n\n25 \n\nphospho amidase and were all able to metabolize glucose, glycerol, 2-keto-D-gluconate, sorbitol, \n\nsaccharose, trehalose and raffinose. No activity for trypsin, ?-chymotrypsin, ?-galactosidase, ?-\n\ngalactosidase, ?-glucuronidase, ?-glucosidase, N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase, ?-mannosidase and ?-\n\nfucosidase was detected in all tested strains. Xylose was consumed by all strains with the exception of \n\nCalf2. The Zba control strain presented the only positive result for esterase (C4), lipase (C14), cystine \n\narylamidase, ?-glucosidase and was the only strain that metabolized galactose, cellobiose and maltose. \n\nBoth Calf2 and Zba strains gave positive results for valine arylamidase and metabolized methyl-D-\n\nglucoside, while the strains Talf1 and Talf2 gave positive for xylitol. The Talf2 and Calf2 both metabolized \n\ninositol.  \n\nThese results are consisting with the putative molecular identification by FISH, because all strains \n\ngave consisting results for glucose, glycerol, arabinose, galactose, lactose, saccharose, melezitose and \n\ntreahalose assimilation. The treahalose assimilation is an important characteristic since it is used to \n\ndistinguish Z. kombuchaensis and Z. lentus from Z. bailii, according to Kurtzman et al. (2011). \n\nInterestingly, it was for the Z. bailii 518F control strain where the results were less conclusive for the \n\nstrain profile. Unexpected positive results for galactose, cellobiose and maltose growth created the \n\ndivergences with the strain type profile in Kurtzman et al. (2011).  The growth in xylose (Talf1 and Talf2), \n\ninositol (Talf2 and Calf2), methyl-D-glucoside (Calf2 and Z. bailii) and raffinose (for all strains tested) was \n\nalso contrary to the Z. bailii type strain accepted profile (Kurtzman et al., 2011). However, replicate tests \n\nshould have been used to confirm the metabolic profiles obtained by the API galleries, as well as the \n\nparallel characterization of the Z. bailii wild type strain for comparison. The API 20C AUX micro-method is \n\nused for identification purposes (Fenn et al., 1994); however fail to differentiate at strain level. Molecular \n\nmethods are used to differentiate at sub-species level, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism \n\n(RFLP), chromosome karyotyping, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and amplified fragment \n\nlength polymorphism (AFLP) (Techera et al., 2001). \n\n3.4. Inulinase production \n\n3.4.1. Substrates Induction \n\nThe three selected yeasts, Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2, with potential to inulinase production were further \n\ntested to produce enzymes and then evaluate their inulinase activities. So, for the production of \n\ninulinases, each of these strains were grown in YMB medium supplemented with 10% (w/v) of inulin or \n\n25% (v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ), as inducer substrates. Table 10 describes the results obtained \n\nfor inulinase activity (U/ml) profiles during the growth of these yeast strains in the two inducers tested. \n\nThese results show that pure inulin was a weak inducer for inulinase production by all strains, reaching to \n\na maximum inulinase activity of about 0.60 U/ml, contrary to JAJ that acted as a strong inducer, \n\nespecially for Talf1 and Talf2, which attained high inulinase activities since the 5th day of growth (see \n\nTable 10). Both Talf1 and Talf2 strains are good enzyme producers, however the maximum value of \n\ninulinase activity was achieved with the strain Talf1 (8.67 U/ml).  \n\nAn important factor for inulinases production is the carbon source that is used as inducer, since it \n\ninfluences the production level of extracellular inulinases (Vijayaraghavan et al., 2009). Commercially \n\navailable inulin has been reported as a good inducer for inulinase producing microorganisms \n\n\n\n26 \n\n(Vijayaraghavan et al., 2009), but inulin rich raw materials can sometime outstand the pure polymer \n\ninduction capacity (Mazutti et al., 2006). The JAJ was neither treated nor purified and could have brought \n\na mix of ions and other compounds, which may act as a nutrient supplement allowing, in this way, the \n\nachievement of higher levels of extracellular inulinase activity by these strains. Further analysis can be \n\ncarried on JAJ to search for the presence of important metallic ions, which may contribute to improve the \n\ninulinase activity, such as Fe\n3+\n\n and Mg\n2+\n\n (Azhari et al., 1989). In addition, studies on the influence of ions \n\nin inulinase activity can also be performed.  \n\nTable 10. Inulinase activity (U/ml) profile during the growth of the yeast strains Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2 in YMB supplemented with \n\n10 % (w/v) inulin or 25 % (v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice, as inducer substrates.

Hence, strain Talf1 \n\nwas selected for the inulinase production for further characterization and application to bioethanol \n\nproduction. \n\nMoreover, for Talf1, the best yeast strain producer of inulinases, a new set of assays were carried out \n\ntesting a wider range of inducer substrates, from different pure inulin sources to complex raw materials, \n\nviewing the improvement of the inulinase production. Inulin purified from different natural sources has \n\ndifferent characteristics, such as different DP levels in the polymer, which can influence the induction \n\nability for the production of inulinases by the yeast strain selected. Thus, in addition to inulin from Fagron, \n\nother two inulins were also tested, namely: an inulin from Sigma (extracted from dahlia tubers) and an \n\ninulin from BDH chemicals (from unknown natural source). Furthermore, besides JAJ, three new complex \n\nraw materials were also tested, namely: dahlia tubers, chard roots and JA solid residue. The results \n\nobtained in these assays are described in Figure 5. All the purified inulins tested were weak inducers \n\nregarding the enzymatic induction. The highest value achieved in pure inulin was 0.6 U/ml with inulin from \n\nSigma. As in the prior assays, the best inducers are the complex natural raw materials. All of them \n\ninduced better enzyme activities than the purified forms of inulin. Regarding the inulin-rich materials \n\ntested as inducer substrates, these assays confirmed that JA is the best inducer substrate, inducing the \n\nhighest inulinase activities even when used in the form of solid residue. The inulinase activities by Talf1 \n\nobserved with JA ranged from 5.9 U/ml (JA solid residue) to 8.7 U/ml (JAJ). So, JAJ was selected as the \n\nbest inducer substrate for the production of Talf1 inulinases. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Induction of inulinase production by Talf1 strain using different substrates. Data are presented as inulinase activity means \n\n\u00b1 standard deviation (n = 2). \n\n3.4.2. Inulinase characterization  \n\nThe characterization of Talf1 enzymatic extract (obtained from Talf1 growth in YMB medium \n\nsupplemented with 25% (v/v) JAJ for 8 days) was performed to verify the optimum temperature and pH of \n\nits activity for inulin, as substrate, as well as to evaluate its thermal and pH stability. Figure 6 shows the \n\nresults of Talf1 inulinase characterization. Figure 6A shows the influence of temperature (25 \u00baC - 65 \u00baC) \n\non Talf1 inulinase activity. The maximal inulinase activity observed was obtained at 45 \u00baC. At 65 \u00baC \n\nalmost all inulinase activity was inactivated (1.7%), which was caused by enzymatic extract denaturation. \n\nIn Figure 6B can be observed the pH profile of Talf1 inulinase, where the optimum pH was 5.5. Thus, for \n\nfurther assays to determine the inulinase activity on Talf1 crude extracts, the best buffer for the reactions \n\nwas considered the sodium citrate 50 mM buffer at pH 5.5.  \n\nIn Figure 6C is shown the effect of temperature on enzyme denaturation, which causes enzyme \n\ninactivation. The thermal stability of Talf1 enzymatic extract was performed at 30, 45 and 50 \u00baC (Figure \n\n6C). When the enzymatic extract was kept at 50 and 45 \u00baC, a complete inactivation occurred after 3 h and \n\n6 h, respectively. In contrast, when kept at 30 \u00baC, the enzymatic extract maintains 91% of the original \n\nactivity after 3 days. The effect of pH (5.5, 7.5 and 10) on the enzyme activity stability was also studied at \n\na temperature of 30 \u00baC (Figure 6D). The enzymatic extract showed reasonable stability at the original pH \n\n(5.5) retaining 57% of its original activity after 24 days when incubated at 30 \u00baC. However, the pH \n\nincrease of the Talf1 crude extract to 7.5 and 10 influenced drastically the enzyme activity stability, \n\nremaining, after 3 days, only 10 and 2% of its original activity, respectively.  \n\nEnzymes are influenced by many factors, such as temperature, pH and metal ions or co-factors \n\naffinity (Chi et al., 2009). From all potentially deactivating factors, temperature is the best studied. At \n\nelevated temperature many enzymes become (partly) unfolded and/or inactivated, meaning that they are \n\nno longer able to perform the desired tasks (Eijsink et al., 2005). The medium pH may also cause \n\ndenaturation of the enzymatic structure, affecting the enzyme interaction with substrate and altering the \n\nactivity levels. Therefore, is very important to determine the optimal conditions for enzymatic activity \n\ndetermination assay, by obtaining the activity profiles for temperature and pH. \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\nChard \nroots \n\nDhalia \ntubers \n\nInulin \n(BDH) \n\nInulin \n(Fagron) \n\nInulin \n(Sigma) \n\nJAJ JA \nresidue \n\nE\nn\n\nz\ny\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n A\n\nc\nt.\n\n (\nU\n\n/m\nl)\n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

(D) Effect of pH (5.5, 7.5 and 10) on enzyme activity stability, kept at \n\n30\u00baC. \n\nA review by Kango and Jain (2011) describes several inulinases from molds, yeasts and bacteria with \n\nvery similar features. In the molds\u2019 group, the inulinases optimum pH and temperature ranges from 4 to \n\n6.5 and 25 - 40 \u00baC, respectively. The bacterial inulinases showed a higher pH and temperature range, \n\nfrom 6.5 to 7.5 and 37 - 50 \u00baC. The yeasts are the most studied group, and their inulinases optimum pH \n\nand temperature ranges from 3.5 to 8 and 28 - 36 \u00baC, respectively.  \n\nThe results of enzymatic activity are difficult to compare due to differences in the units used. Some \n\nauthors described inulinases in Units per grams of dry substrate (U gds\n-1\n\n) and others in specific activity \n\n(U.mg\n-1\n\n). A high disparity is notice along different works: some reports suggest inulinase activities as high \n\nas 1 139 U/ml for a K. marxianus strain (Sguarezi et al., 2009), while others referred levels of 0.463 U/ml \n\nfor a different strain of the same specie (Selvakumar and Pandey, 1999). \n\nEnzymatic stability, both to temperature and pH, is the most necessary feature for application of \n\nenzymes in bioprocesses (Mateo et al., 2007; Iyer and Ananthanarayan, 2008). In this context, the \n\ncharacteristics of Talf1 inulinases: optimum pH and temperature of 5.5 and 45 \u00baC, respectively, and the \n\nhigh stability at 30 \u00baC (maintaining 57% activity after 24 days at 30 \u00baC) are favorable for its further \n\napplication in a SSF process of bioethanol production from inulin or inulin-rich materials. \n\n0 \n\n20 \n\n40 \n\n60 \n\n80 \n\n100 \n\n15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 \n\nE\nn\n\nz\ny\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n A\n\nc\nt.\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nIncubation temperature (\u00baC) \n\n0 \n\n20 \n\n40 \n\n60 \n\n80 \n\n100 \n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n\nBuffer's pH \n\n0 \n\n20 \n\n40 \n\n60 \n\n80 \n\n100 \n\n0 1 2 3 \n\nE\nn\n\nz\ny\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n A\n\nc\nt.\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nTime (days) \n\n30 \u00b0C \n\n45 \u00b0C \n\n50 \u00b0C \n\n0 \n\n20 \n\n40 \n\n60 \n\n80 \n\n100 \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 \n\nE\nn\n\nz\ny\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n A\n\nc\nt.\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nTime (days) \n\npH = 5.5 \n\npH = 7.5 \n\npH = 10 \n\nA B \n\nC D \n\n\n\n29 \n\n3.5.

An acid hydrolysis carried on the end samples of the \n\nprocess revealed a remaining 50 g/l of inulin (as glucose and fructose) in the CBP fermentative medium, \n\nwhich could be explained by the presence of long-chain inulin harder to enzymatic hydrolysis or due to \n\nlow enzymatic efficiency. Therefore the ethanol yield obtained was 45%, quite close to the 51% of the \n\ntheoretical ethanol yield (Dien et al., 2003). \n\nThe SSF bioprocess for bioethanol production from 200 g/l of inulin (Figure 7B) was carried out using \n\nthe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI 885 and supplementing the IFM with 5% (v/v) Talf1 crude \n\nenzymatic extract (with 8.7 U/ml of inulinase activity). In the presence of inulinases, the S. cerevisiae \n\nstrain presented a similar growth rate to the isolated strain Talf1 (?max = 0.15 h\n-1\n\n), however achieved a \n\nhigher ethanol production, 78 g/l (see Table 11), remaining yet 34 g/l of non hydrolyzed inulin in the \n\nfermentative medium. In these conditions, the maximum ethanol productivity was 2.75 g.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n and the \n\nethanol yield was 47%. The ethanol production by S. cerevisiae corresponds to 92% of theoretical \n\nethanol yield, which is 4% higher in comparison with that obtained by the yeast strain Talf1 in CBP. The \n\nyeast S. cerevisiae, contrary to strain Talf1, did not have to produce the enzymatic complex necessary to \n\ninulin hydrolysis because the inulinases were added to the fermentative medium, and thus achieved \n\nhigher ethanol productivity. The quantity of enzyme added to the SSF process (5% v/v) was sufficient to \n\nprevent sugar limitation, because at the first 24 h of fermentation there was an accumulation of sugars in \n\nthe broth, ready to be used (see Figure 7B).   \n\nIn order to access the influence of the Talf1 inulinases addition in the inulin fermentation ability by S. \n\ncerevisiae CCMI 885, a control growth was conducted without inulinases addition. In this assay, the S. \n\ncerevisiae strain was only able to produce 50 g/l of ethanol from the 200 g/l of inulin (Figure 7C). These \n\nresults suggest that this strain was able to partially consume inulin, but not all, which has been previously \n\nreported to other Saccharomyces strains (Lim et al., 2011; Schorr-Galindo et al., 2000). This ability as \n\nbeen connected to the consumption of small size inulin molecules, with DP under 6, probably by action of \n\nan invertase with affinity for small D-fructo-furanosides. So, in SSF process, the Talf1 inulinases \n\n\n\n31 \n\nhydrolyzed fibers which were not naturally used by the S. cerevisiae strain, leading to a bioethanol \n\nproduction increase, from 50 to 78 g/l (see Table 11). \n\n3.5.1.2. Jerusalem artichoke juice fermentation in CBP and SSF \n\nJerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ), an inulin-rich complex material containing about 130 g/l of sugars \n\n(quantified by acid hydrolyses), was used as the only nutrients medium for bioethanol production in a \n\nCBP and a SSF process. The results of batch fermentations of JAJ are presented in Figure 8, and Table \n\n12 summarizes the most important metabolic parameters. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 8.

The maximum growth rate achieved was 0.13 h\n-1\n\n and the highest productivity \n\nmeasured was 3.62 g.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n (see Table 12). The maximum value of ethanol achieved by Talf1 strain was \n\nabout 67 g/l of ethanol, and the acid hydrolysis of the end samples revealed no remaining sugars. \n\nTherefore, the calculated ethanol yield was 51% considering only the measurable sugars quantified, \n\nwhich corresponds to the theoretical ethanol yield. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\n0 50 100 150 200 \n\nT\no\n\nta\nl \ns\n\nu\ng\n\na\nrs\n\n, \nE\n\nth\na\n\nn\no\n\nl \n(g\n\n/l\n) \n\nTime (hours) \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\n0 50 100 150 200 \n\nL\nn\n\n(O\nD\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n) \n\nTime (hours) \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\n0 50 100 150 200 \n\nL\nn\n\n(O\nD\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n) \n\nT\no\n\nta\nl \ns\n\nu\ng\n\na\nrs\n\n, \nE\n\nth\na\n\nn\no\n\nl \n(g\n\n/l\n) \n\nTime (hours) \n\nTotal sugars Ethanol Ln(OD) \n\nC \n\nA B \n\n\n\n32 \n\nTable 12.

In these conditions, the yeast S. cerevisiae strain presented a \n\nweaker growth rate (0.11 h\n-1\n\n) and a lower productivity (2.40 g.l.\n-1\n\nh\n-1\n\n) in comparison to Talf1 in the CBP \n\n(see Table 12). The maximum ethanol concentration attained was about 63 g/l, with no residual sugar. In \n\noverall, the S. cerevisiae strain was less efficient than the strain Talf1 for the bioethanol production from \n\npure JAJ, achieving a maximum ethanol yield of 48%.  \n\nIn addition, to verify the ability of S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 to directly ferment the JAJ, a control \n\nfermentation assay with this S. cerevisiae strain in pure JAJ was conducted (see Figure 8C). The S. \n\ncerevisiae strain was able to produce 55 g/l of ethanol directly from this natural raw material. The \n\nmaximum growth rate and ethanol productivity attained were 0.12 h\n-1\n\n and 2.07 g.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n, respectively (see \n\nTable 12). These results are consistent with those obtained in pure inulin fermentation, indicating once \n\nagain the inability of S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 to utilize most carbon fibers present in JAJ as inulin, since \n\nthe ethanol yield reached was 42%, substantially lower when compared to that obtained in the SSF \n\nprocess (see Table 12).  \n\nThe Talf1 enzymes supplementation to a SSF process with a known good ethanologenic strain (S. \n\ncerevisiae), even though it improved the bioethanol production yield from JAJ, it did not attained the same \n\nethanol yield of the CBP approach with Talf1 (see Table 12). \n\nFrom the comparison between the two SSF processes conducted with Talf1 inulinases and the S. \n\ncerevisiae strain for bioethanol production from inulin (Figure 7B) and JAJ (Figure 8B), it can be observed \n\nthat the bioprocess with pure inulin was more successful in terms of maximum ethanol produced (78.0 g/l \n\nversus 62.8 g/l for JAJ), however in terms of ethanol yield the value obtained was slightly lower (47% \n\nversus 48% for JAJ), due to the remaining non hydrolyzed inulin (34 g/l) in the fermentative broth at the \n\nend of the assay. The ethanol yields attained in both these SSF processes are higher than those previous \n\ndescribed by other authors (Ohta et al., 1992). \n\n The CBP bioprocess with Talf1 strain to obtain bioethanol was improved for ethanol yield when \n\napplied directly to the Jerusalem artichoke (JA) which attained the theoretical ethanol yield (51%). The \n\nbest results obtained for JA fermentation were described using a S. cerevisiae strain in a SHF (Zhang et \n\nal., 2010) and a SSF (Nakamura et al., 1996), however, in this work, the CBP with the novel Talf1 yeast \n\nstrain achieved higher ethanol yields. Other researchers also studied a CBP method using inulinase \n\nproducing yeast like K. marxianus (Yuan et al., 2008b; Bajpai and Margaritis, 1986), but achieving lower \n\nethanol concentrations or yields.  \n\n\n\n33 \n\nThe direct fermentation of JA with a S. cerevisiae strain was assayed by Lim and colleagues (2011), \n\nbut only 36 g/l of ethanol were produced. The S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 strain, used in this work, was able \n\nto produce 55 g/l of ethanol, which may be explained by raw material differences in nutrients content \n\nand/or indicates the ability of this strain to efficiently use some inulin molecules. \n\n3.5.2. Strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice as Fermentation Medium \n\nBatch fermentation assays, using strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice (STFJ) as sole nutrients source, were \n\nconducted using four novel yeast strains isolated from strawberry tree fruit (STF), namely AP1, DP2, \n\nGerP3 and GluP4, and a known highly ethanologenic yeast strain, S. cerevisiae CCMI 885. The results of \n\nthe batch fermentations of STFJ are presented in Figure 9, and in Table 13 are summarized the most \n\nimportant metabolic parameters.  \n\nThese results indicate that the best ethanol producing yeast was the S. cerevisiae strain CCMI 885 \n\n(see Figure 9E), which achieved the highest ethanol concentration (about 108 g/l), productivity (1.29     \n\ng.l\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) and yield (51%, the theoretical yield for ethanol production) (see Table 13). The isolate GerP3, a \n\nputative Z. bailii strain, achieved the second best series of results. It was able to produce 100 g/l of \n\nbioethanol (see Figure 9C), with a productivity of 1.11 g.l.\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n and an ethanol yield of 50%, due to the \n\nremaining 7 g/l of free sugars in the fermentation broth at the end of the assay. The STFJ fermentations \n\nwith the yeasts DP2 and GluP4 (Figure 9B and 9D), two putative S. cerevisiae strains, resulted in lower \n\nethanol yield, caused by lower ethanol concentration produced, about 95 and 92 g/l, respectively (see \n\nTable 13), with a remaining sugar content of 13 g/l on the fermentation broth for both strains.  \n\nTable 13.

The less effective \n\nfermentation was the one using AP1, a putative L. thermotolerans strain. The maximum ethanol \n\nconcentration produced by this strain was 86 g/l with a remaining sugar content of 25 g/l (see Figure 9A), \n\nresulting in an ethanol yield of 47%. \n\nThe STFJ was characterized by HPLC for its sugar content, showing a high soluble sugar \n\nconcentration, 209 g/l, most of which fructose (157 g/l) and the rest glucose (52 g/l). STFJ is a complex \n\nraw material, presenting most of the necessary nutrients for microbial growth, contributing for a total \n\nsugar conversion into ethanol within a fermentation process. \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.

Conclusions  \n\nThe main goal of this work was to search for novel microbial strains, in special new yeasts, with high \n\npotential to produce bioethanol, due to either the presence of better ethanologenic characteristics (e. g. \n\nhigh tolerance to ethanol, and extremes pH and/or temperature) or the production of relevant hydrolytic \n\nenzymatic machinery, which can be competitive in further application for industrial bioprocesses. In this \n\ncontext, an isolation of novel microorganisms was carried out from different materials rich in fermentable \n\nsugars or polysaccharides (inulin), followed by a screening for their ability to produce relevant enzymes \n\nand/or alcoholic fermentation. \n\nA total of 98 microbial isolates were collected, from which 7 yeasts strains were selected based on \n\ntheir promising features observed: all strains had potential to bioethanol production and three present the \n\nability to produce inulinases, important enzymes to apply in bioprocesses using inulin or inulin-rich \n\nmaterials.  \n\nA preliminary molecular identification, using oligonucleotide FITC marked probes by FISH, gave a \n\nputative identification for the selected isolates, separating them in three species: L. thermotolerans (AP1), \n\nS. cerevisiae (GluP4 and DP2) and Z. bailii (GerP3, Calf2, Talf1 and Talf2). These results must be further \n\nconcluded with more classical and molecular standard identification methods, as morphological \n\ndescription, carbon and nitrogen fermentation and assimilation capacity and genetic sequencing for the \n\nidentification validation.  \n\nIn order to use inulin or inulin-rich materials as a carbon source for bioprocesses, they must be \n\nhydrolyzed either chemically (acid pre-treatment) or enzymatically (through inulinases). The pre-treatment \n\nof raw substrates in an industrial scale represents a substantial cost increase, which means that the \n\napplication of inulinases or the use of an ethanologenic and inulinase producer to the process to obtain \n\nbioethanol could be an advantage, contributing to a less expensive bioprocess. Hence, in this work the \n\nTalf1 strain was selected as the best inulinase producer, and both the optimization of the inulinase \n\nproduction as well as its characterization were carried out. Talf1 crude extract activity attained the \n\nmaximum values (8.7 U/ml) at the optimal pH and temperature, 5.5 and 45 \u00baC, respectively, and its \n\nstability is high at 30\u00baC (the enzyme presents > 50% activity after 24 days at 30 \u00baC), which are promising \n\ncharacteristics for its further application for bioethanol bioprocesses.  \n\nThe assays carried out with inulin (IFM) in a SSF process, using S. cerevisiae strain CCMI 885 and \n\nTalf1 inulinases, attained higher ethanol production (78 g/l) than the CBP assay (67 g/l), while the \n\nfermentation assays with the Jerusalem artichoke juice attained better results in CBP, using the Talf1 \n\nstrain. These results show the enormous potential of inulin and inulin rich raw materials, as Jerusalem \n\nartichoke, as substrates for bioethanol production. Further optimization and scale-up analysis is required \n\nusing these novel isolated yeast strains.  \n\nMoreover, batch fermentations directly from strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice (a complex raw material \n\ncomposed by high sugar content and the nutrients required for microbial growth) were carried out using \n\nthe 4 selected strains isolated from strawberry tree fruits. In overall, the 4 yeast strains tested gave \n\nsatisfactory results for bioethanol production from strawberry tree fruit\u2019 juice fermentation, with yields \n\nranging from 47 to 50%. However, the GerP3 strain, a putative Z. bailii, achieved the most promising \n\nresults for its further application in a solid state fermentation directly from strawberry tree fruit, as \n\n\n\n36 \n\nperformed at industrial scale for the production of an economically important distilled drink from this \n\nmaterial. \n\nThe development of efficient and economically viable bioethanol production processes is crucial in \n\ntoday\u2019s society, due to worldwide fuel depletion and increasing energetic requirements. The utilization of \n\nraw materials, such as Jerusalem artichoke and strawberry tree fruit, for bioethanol production could help \n\nto reduce the energy dependence of fossil fuel. Optimization studies of the processes with these natural \n\nraw materials must be carried out for further application at industrial scale. \n\n  \n\n\n\n37 \n\n5.
