In Lago Parano\u00e1, located in Bras\u00edlia, the capital city of Brazil, fishing was studied by \nconducting interviews with 53 fishers filling in logbooks from March, 1??? to March, 2000 in three fishing communi-\nties. The fishers come from the poorest towns around Bras\u00edlia, known as satellite-towns. They have been living there \non average for 21.7 years (s = ?.6 years), their families have 4.? members (s = 3.6) on average and 44.2% do not have \na basic education. However, such characteristics are similar to the socioeconomic indices of the metropolis where \nthey live. In spite of being illegal between 1?66 and 2000, fishing generated an average monthly income of U$ 23?.00 \n(s = U$ 171.77). The Nile Tilapia Oreocrhromis niloticus is the main captured species (85% of a total number of land-\nings in weight of 62.5 t.). Fishing is carried out in rowing boats, individually or in pairs. The fishing equipment used \nare gillnets and castnets. Gillnets were used actively, whereby the surface of the water is beaten with a stick to drive \nTilapias towards nets as they have the ability to swim backwards. This fishing strategy was used in 64.7% of the fisher-\nies, followed by castnets (31.1%) and by gillnets which were used less (4.2%). The fish is sold directly in the streets \nand fairs of the satellite-towns to middlemen or to bar owners. Three communities have different strategies in terms of \nfishing equipments, fishing spots and commercialization. Consequently, there are statistically significant differences in \nrelation to the monthly income for each one of these communities. \n\nKeywords: Inland small-scale fishery, urban reservoir fisheries, fishing income, Lago Parano\u00e1, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil.\n\nA pesca de pequena escala no Lago Parano\u00e1 Bras\u00edlia, DF, Brazil\n\nResumo\n\nEm muitos centros urbanos, com corpos d\u00b4\u00e1gua apropriados, as pescarias de pequena escala s\u00e3o a \u00fanica fonte de \nprote\u00edna barata para os pobres. No Lago Parano\u00e1, localizado em Bras\u00edlia, a atividade pesqueira foi estudada atrav\u00e9s \nde entrevistas com 53 pescadores que vivem em cidades sat\u00e9lites, de Mar\u00e7o/1??? a Mar\u00e7o/2000, em tr\u00eas comunida-\ndes pesqueiras. Nesse per\u00edodo os pescadores viviam nas cidades sat\u00e9lites em m\u00e9dia h\u00e1 21,7 anos (s = ?,6 anos), com \nfam\u00edlias de 4,? membros (s = 3,6) e 44,2% deles n\u00e3o possu\u00edam instru\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00ednima. Entretanto, suas condi\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o se-\nmelhantes aquelas apontadas pelos indicadores socioecon\u00f4micos das \u00e1reas onde residem. A pesca, embora clandestina \nde 1?66 a 2000, gerou um rendimento m\u00e9dio de U$ 23?,00 (s = U$ 171,77). A til\u00e1pia do Nilo Oreochromis niloticus \nfoi a principal esp\u00e9cie capturada (85% de um rendimento total em peso de 62,5 t). As pescarias foram realizadas em \ncanoas a remo, individualmente ou em duplas. As artes empregadas foram a malhadeira e a tarrafa. A malhadeira foi \nempregada de modo ativo sob a forma de batida, onde se bate na \u00e1gua com um bast\u00e3o para afugentar as til\u00e1pias em \ndire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s redes. Essa estrat\u00e9gia foi empregada em 64,7% das pescarias, seguida pela tarrafa (31,1%) e pela malha-\ndeira empregada passivamente (4,2%). O pescado foi vendido diretamente nas ruas e em feiras das cidades-sat\u00e9lite, \npor atravessadores ou donos de bar.

Introduction\n\nIn 2000, the total amount of fish landing in the world \nwas close to ?5 million tons, of which 8.8 million (?%) \nwere fresh water fish (FAO, 2003). In 2000, in Brazil it \na total production of 847 thousand tons was estimated \n(FAO, 2003).\n\nSmall-scale fisheries are the main suppliers of good \nquality protein for local populations. Fishers use a wide \nvariety of equipment and most of the boats are not mo-\ntorized. The fishers go fishing on their own, in pairs or \nin small groups from four to six individuals and they are \nunder economical pressure which makes them select \nfish of a larger value. Their relationship with the market \nis characterized by the middlemen\u2019s presence (Bayley \nand Petrere, 1?8?; Petrere, 1?8?; Fischer et al., 1??2; \nDiegues, 1??5). Diegues (1??5) estimated that 550.000 \nsmall-scale fishers in Brazil are responsible for a high \nproportion of quality fish which is sold on the domestic \nand external market. \n\nIn many Brazilian urban-reservoirs, small-scale fish-\nery is the only source for the poor population. In many \ngreat cities, there are appropriate water structures, such \nas in the Represa Billings (127 km2) in the capital city \nof S\u00e3o Paulo, in Lagoa Pampulha (0.3 km2) in the capi-\ntal of Belo Horizonte and in Lago Parano\u00e1 (38 km2) in \nBras\u00edlia, the capital of Brazil (Petrere, 1??5). Minte-Vera \nand Petrere (2000) estimated there were 101 fishers in the \nRepresa Billings and a production of 63 kg.ha.-1.year-1, \nwhere 81.4% of the total landings in weight (147.6 tons) \nis represented by the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus.\n\n In Lagoa Pampulha in Belo Horizonte, there are ap-\nproximately 1,600 fishers and for 83.3% fish is a basic \nfood. It is considered that many of the fish which are \ncaught are tilapia Oreocrohomis sp. (82.4% of ?44 fish), \n\nfollowed by tra\u00edra Hoplias cf. lacerdae (4.?%) and \nmatrinch\u00e3 Brycon lundii (3.?%), (Godinho et al., 1??2).\n\n Lago Parano\u00e1 dam was built in 1?5?, one year before \nthe new capital city of Brazil was inaugurated (Figure 1). \nAt that time, the purpose of building the reservoir was to \nincrease the relative humidity of the air to produce elec-\ntric power, to serve as a recreation area, a place to keep \nfish, landscape, a place for sewer effluents and rainwater \n(Fran\u00e7a et al., 1?64). The lake has an area of 3,800 ha \nand is in the urban district of Bras\u00edlia and there were \ntwo million inhabitants in 2000 (CODEPLAN, 2000). \nDuring the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, Lago Parano\u00e1 went through \na eutrophication process due to the inefficiency in col-\nlecting and treating sewers in the two treatment stations \n(North and South) located on their banks (Palmer, 1?6?; \nOliveira and Krau, 1?70; Branco, 1?76). However, from \n1??3 onwards the new treatment stations started to oper-\nate, both using a sewer treatment system removing nu-\ntrients in order to enable the ecosystem of the lake to \nrecompose. After three years, the lake showed obvious \nsigns of recovery (Fernandes and Pinto, 1??8). \n\nAfter constructing the reservoir, various species of \nfish were introduced for recreational purposes and as a \nplace for posterior fish farming around Bras\u00edlia. Small-\nscale fishing, which had not been contemplated, started \nspontaneously. In 1??8, after doing a very well-designed \nhydro-acoustic experiment, the lake fish total biomass \nwas estimated at 1,400 toneladas (Lebourges-Dhaussy \net al., 1??8), mainly consisting of acar\u00e1 Geophagus \nbrasiliensis, bagre (catfish) Rhamdia quelen, cascudo \n(armoured fish) Hypostomus sp., jeju Erytinus erytinus, \nlambari Astyanax sp, mussum Synbranchus marmoratus, \nplanaltina Planaltina meyersi, sa\u00faba or sag\u00fciru \nSteindachnerina isnculpta, tamoat\u00e1 Hoplosternum \n litorale, tra\u00edra Hoplias malabaricus and trair\u00e3o Hoplias \n\nBrazil\n\n48\u00b0 15\u2019 48\u00b0 00\u2019 47\u00b0 45\u2019 47\u00b0 35\u2019\n\n15\u00b0 30\u2019\n\n15\u00b0 45\u2019\n\n16\u00b0 00\u2019\n\n0 5 10 15 km\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n\n1011\n\n12\n\n13\n\nP\nre\n\nto\n R\n\niv\ner\n\nLago Parano\u00e1\n1 - Planaltina\n\nCountry of DF\n\n2 - Sobradinho\n3 - Parano\u00e1\n4 - Vila Telebras\u00edlia\n5 - Taguatinga\n6 - Ceil\u00e2ndia\n7 - Samambaia\n8 - Riacho Fundo\n9 - Recanto das Emas\n10 - Santa Maria\n11 - Gama\n12 - Pedregal\n13 - \u00c1guas Lindas\n\nD\nes\n\nco\nbe\n\nrt\no \n\nR\niv\n\ner\n\nD\nes\n\nco\nbe\n\nrt\no \n\nR\niv\n\ner\n\nN\n\nS\n\nW E\n\nFigure 1.

The introduced species were bluegill \nLepomis macrochira, common carp Cyprinus carpio, \nsilver carp Hypophthlmicthyes molitrix, Congo tilapia \nTilapia rendalli, Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and \ntucunar\u00e9 (oscar) Cichla sp. (Lazzaro et al., 1??8). T h i s \nbiomass estimation is equivalent to a production higher \nthan 300 kg.ha-1. This result places Lago Parano\u00e1 among \nthe most productive ecosystems when compared to \ntemperate and subtropical lakes (Brabrand et al., 1??0; \nBachmann et al., 1??6). \n\nAlthough small-scale fishing started when the dam \nwas built, commercial fishing with castnets and gillnets \nwas prohibited between 1?66 and 1??? and was only \nmade legal when the Lebourges-Dhaussy et al. (1??8) \nexperiment was being conducted. Even though it was \nillegal, in 1?85 there were at least 100 families living \nexclusively from fishing at Lago Parano\u00e1. According to \ninformation given by older fishers, the annual fish pro-\nduction at that time was estimated around 200 annual \ntons (48.1 kg.ha-1.year-1).  The landings were almost all \ntilapias, carps but rarely, catfish and tucunar\u00e9s. The fish \nwas totally consumed in the satellite-towns in great \ndemand. As always, all fish was sold by middlemen \n(Dornelles and Dias Neto, 1?85). However, from 1??1, \nan increase in the efficiency of inspections, as well as a \nPolice Station which was built opposite the best fishing \nspot of the lake caused a decline in professional fishing. \nOn the other hand, the stock assessment of Lago Parano\u00e1 \ndetected a large tilapia biomass leading to an increased \nconcentration of phosphorous making the water quality \nworse, because they stirred the bottom, releasing depos-\nited and inactive phospohorous (Marmori, 1??5; Starling \nand Lazzaro, 1??7 and; Starling, 1??8). This led to some \nenvironmental agencies making professional fishing le-\ngal on the lake in order to reduce the population of tila-\npias.\n\nThe main objective of this paper is to describe the \nsocioeconomic importance of professional small-scale \nfishing at Lago Parano\u00e1 as a supplier of income and pro-\ntein for the poor population of the Federal District (DF) \nin order to subsidize its permanent legalisation. \n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nThe socioeconomic description was made by con-\nducting interviews with professional fishers, whose \nquestionnaires were closed and modified from Val\u00eancio \n(1??5). Sampling was at random, as described by \nIBAMA/DNOCS/GTZ (1??2), where an available fisher \ninterviewee recommended others and so on. This pro-\ncedure was also adopted because we did not know the \nnumber of existing professional fishers at Lago Parano\u00e1 \nbeforehand. Data collection was carried out between \n24/01/?? and 25/03/?? in four areas of interviews: \nAcampamento da Telebras\u00edlia (28 fishers), Vila Parano\u00e1 \n(12 fishers), at Esta\u00e7\u00e3o de Tratamentos de Esgotos Sul \n\u2013 ETE Sul (? fishers) and at Esta\u00e7\u00e3o de Tratamentos de \nEsgotos Norte ETE Norte (4 fishers). After the inter-\n\nviews, catching and data was done in three of the de-\nscribed communities, except in ETE Norte. Landings \nwere monitored from March/1??? to March/ 2000, mak-\ning a total of 1,4?8 fishing trips. \n\nThe sampling unit is for each fishing trip, once in \nLago Parano\u00e1, apart from 32 trips in which one piece \nof fishing equipment was used. The catch was defined \nby the total amount in weight (kg) of round fish. As a \nscale was not always available to weigh the fish, two \nalternatives were adopted. The first one consisted of \ncounting the number of 18-liter cans with fish in as some \nfishers sell their products in these containers. Later, we \nweighed a few cans at random containing tilapias or carp \nseparately and calculated their average weight for future \nconversion. The second alternative was to quantify a \nfisher\u2019s estimated catch in weight according to Petrere \n(1?78) who points out that a fisher often knows the pre-\ncise weight of the catch and the correction can be made \nmaking use of a simple linear regression. The X vari-\nable, which is always available, is the estimated catch \nby a given fisher in weight and the Y variable is the real, \ncorresponding weighed catch by a scale, in a random \nexperiment. Finally, some fishers weighed the fish after \nevisceration. For correction of those values, we calcu-\nlated a linear regression between the rounded up weight \n(in kg) Y and the corresponding weight (in kg) of the \neviscerated fish X for each species.\n\nAfter the convenient data transformation, a simple \nlinear regression was done in order to explore the re-\nlationship between catch and effort. A socioeconomic \nanalysis was carried out making use of descriptive sta-\ntistics. The average monthly income was calculated from \nthe catch information and from the commercialization \nprice from each fisher. A comparison among incomes \nwas made by an ANOVA and a further Scheff\u00e9 test of \nmultiple comparison a posteriori. During the interviews, \nUS$ 1 = R$ 1.80. \n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. The professional fishers\n\n3.1.1. Their origin and settlement time \n\nThe site with a larger concentration of interviewed \nfishers was Vila da Telebras\u00edlia (28 fishers), followed by \nVila Parano\u00e1 (12), Buraco (?) and ETE Norte (4). Vila \nTelebras\u00edlia and Vila Parano\u00e1 are places where people \nlive. The other two are landing places (Figure 2). From \nthe interviews, we estimated that there were 55 active \nfishers in Lago Parano\u00e1, showing that we nearly reached \nthe whole population using our non-random sampling \nprocedure. \n\nThe fishers have lived in the Federal District \nor in the satellite-towns for 21.7 years, on average \n(s = ?.6 years, n = 53), where 4?% have lived there for \nmore than 21 years. We judge that this average is quite \nhigh as Bras\u00edlia was founded in 1?60 in an original no-\nman\u2019s land. From these, 11.5% were born in the Federal \n\n\n\nWalter, T. and Petrere Jr., M.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 67(1): 9-21, 200712\n\nDistrict. From the remaining, the most representative \narea is the Northeast (64.1%), followed by the Center-\nWest (32.1%) and the Southeast (3.8%). \n\n3.1.2. Home conditions, basic sanitation  \nand electric energy \n\nMost of the fishers own their own houses (41 fish-\ners), followed by those who pay rent (5), those who live \nwith relatives (3), those who live in invaded areas (3) and \none who is a caretaker. The average size of the houses is \nof 76.2 m2 (s = 5?.5? m2. n = 52). The smallest house has \n2 m2 and the largest, 360 m2. \n\nThe average size of the families is 4.? people (n = 53, \ns = 3.62) varying from 1 to twelve members. \n\nThe houses have masonry walls (32 houses) or wood \n(21). The material of the roofs is usually made of fibroce-\nment (48 houses) or tiles (3). There are 2 fishers who \nlive in canvas huts. The floors are made of rough cement \nor burned \u201cvermelh\u00e3o\u201d (40 houses), followed by tile or \nceramic floors (?) and soil (4). \n\nIn 50 houses, the source of energy comes from the \npublic electric power system, 2 from kerosene lanterns \nor candles and 1 from the community\u2019s generator. The \nfuel used for cooking is from gas jars (51) and firewood \n(2). In 46 houses, the water comes from the public sup-\nply.\n\nIn 50 houses there are sanitary facilities. From these, \n32 are connected to the public sewage system, 11 have \nraw sewage, 7 have a septic tank and 1 throws the sewage \ninto a ditch. \n\nIn 44 houses, there is public garbage collection, in ? \nthe garbage is burnt, in 3 it is buried, in 2 it is taken to \nwastelands and in 1 it is disposed of in water. \n\n3.1.3. Sex and age of the fishers\n\nWhile being interviewed, there was only one fish-\nerwoman, although as mentioned previously, there is a \nlarger amount of fisherwomen. The youngest fisher was \n17 years old and the oldest 67 (n = 52). On average, the \ninterviewees\u2019 age was of 40.7 years (s = 12.8). 50% of \n\nthe interviewees\u2019 were between 17 and 40 years old. \nThere were two classes of fishers, an older one (between \n41 and 67 years) and a younger one, made up mainly of \ntheir children, who are married and who are also fishers. \n\n3.1.4. Education \n\nFrom the 52 Lago Parano\u00e1 fishers, 52% never at-\ntended school or went for less than four years, 21.1% \nwere illiterate, 5.8% knew \u201c how to read and write\u201d, but \nnever went to school, 1.?% were at adult primary school \nand 23.1% did not finish school (Table 1).\n\n3.1.5. Importance of fish in the diet \n\nThe fish caught in the lake is an important basic food \nas it is consumed by 61.2% of the families more than \nthree times a week, on average (Table 2). \n\n3.2. The fisheries\n\n3.2.1. Dedication to fishing \n\nDedication to fishing is important in order to evalu-\nate if the activity is sufficient for the fisher and his family \nto survive. Another important factor is the time between \nharvesting periods, when the fisher leaves the activity to \ndo something else or changes fishing strategies in order \nto catch other fish species. \n\nThroughout the interviews, three groups of fishers \ncould be observed (Table 3). In the first one, fishing is \ntheir main activity and they may or may not have a sec-\nond source of income (3?.6%, n = 53). The second group \nstops fishing due to inspection checks and only returns \nwhen there are no more (32.1%). The third group is par-\ntially active (28.3%), stopping when another job oppor-\ntunity arises or when the fishing equipament is taken by \nthe police. Among the active fishers, 47.6% (n = 21) only \nlive off fishing. \n\nAmong the unstable fishers, when they were being \ninterviewed, 40.0% (n = 15) did not have another source \nof income and 46.7% were autonomous. Among those \nfishers that stopped fishing, 17.6% (n = 17) were unem-\nployed. \n\nThroughout 1???, 18.?% (n = 53) of the fishers only \nlived off fishing, which is a low number when compared \nto 1??5, where 73.?% of the interviewees (n = 46) only \nlived off fishing (Walter, 2000). \n\nThe remaining fishers have the fishery as a main \nsource of income. From the 3?.6% (n = 53) who are au-\ntonomous, all of them have few professional qualifica-\ntions. However, all the fishers affirmed that they fish all \nyear round, except for two that only fish at the end of \nthe dry period and one that only fishes when he is un-\nemployed. \n\n3.2.2. The fishing boats and its crew \n\nIn the Lago Parano\u00e1, professional fishing is done in \npaddle wooden canoes with one or two crew members. \nOnly 7.5% (n = 53) said they fished alone. The crews \nare made up of friends (50.?%), relatives (32.1%) and \nemployees (?.4%, n = 51).

In this case, both are fishers, unlike when there is \npayment for the activity, where the crew consists of a \nfisher and an assistant. There are some cases where the \nfishing assistant is a member of the family as a son. In \nthese cases, there is no remuneration, as the income is in \nthe same family. \n\nThe canoes are usually made by their owners at an \naverage cost of U$ 38.60 (n = 48, s = 15.05). \n\n3.2.3. The fish species \n\nAccording to Gulland (1?76), in some fisheries, the \ncrew uses a combination of various techniques to catch \na target species. In some cases, together with this spe-\ncies there is a catch, which is either discarded or sold \nat a low price. In Lago Parano\u00e1, the target species are \nthe Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and the sa\u00faba or \nsag\u00fcir\u00fa Steindachnerina insculpta. The other non-target \nspecies are associated to catching these two, but some \nare economically important, such as the tra\u00edra Hoplias \nmalabaricus or they may often appear, such as the com-\nmon carp Cyprinus carpio, so they cannot be considered \nas a catch because they are not discarded. With the ex-\nception of the common carp, these species have a better \nprice on the market.\n\nThe carp is the non-target species which ap-\npears in more trips (48.8%) followed by Congo tilapia \n(1?.3%). tra\u00edra (15.4%) and tucunar\u00e9 (10.4%, n = 1.4?8). \nAccording to the fishers, carp and congo tilapia are sold \nto the middlemen mixed with Nile tilapia. When sold in \nretail, common carp is not well accepted and the tilapias \nare sold mixed. Tra\u00edra and tucunar\u00e9 are either consumed \nor sold for higher prices than the tilapias. Species such \nas the silver carp, tambaqui, piapara and African catfish \nare considered special as they are the most expensive on \nthe market. \n\nThe three more frequent species in the fisheries are \ninvaders: Nile tilapia (appeared ?6.7%), common carp \n(48.8%) and Congo tilapia (1?.3%). \n\n3.2.4.

However, remov-\ning these three values, the residues remained non ten-\ndentious and normal (g1 = -0.186 and g2 = 0.027).

Note the high correlation coefficients in all \n cases.\n\n3.2.5. Fishing equipment and fishing strategies \n\nAccording to Minte-Vera and Petrere (2000), some \nfishing strategies may consist of a combination of differ-\nent equipment with appropriate mesh and type of habitat. \nDue to these combinations, a fisher tries to increase his/\nher chance of catching the target species. Therefore, in \nLago Parano\u00e1 two types of equipment are used in profes-\nsional fishing: castnets and gillnets. A gillnet can be used \nin two ways: actively or passively. When used actively, \nthe following local technique called batida (beat) is used: \nthe fishers beat the water surface with a stick driving the \ntilapias towards the net as they have the ability to swim \nbackwards. The purpose of Batida is to mainly catch Nile \ntilapia. Therefore, 35.8% of the fishers fish exclusively \nwith castnets (n = 51) and 22.6% fish exclusively with \ngillnets. The others (41.6%) fish with both. However, the \nfishers from Vila da Telebras\u00edlia only used castnets, except \nfor three, who also used gillnets. On the other hand, the \nVila Parano\u00e1 fishers only fish with batida and the Buraco \nfish fishers with castnets and gillnets, except for two, one \nwho only uses castnets and another only gillnets. The four \nfishers interviewed in ETE Norte only fish with castnets. \n\nIn the Lago Parano\u00e1, the gillnets used in batida have \nfrom one to three sets of nets tied together with the same \nor different mesh sizes. The average total length of the \nwhole set is 142.2 m, average mesh size of ?.4 cm be-\ntween opposite knots and an average height of 2.0 m.\n\nThe castnets are also used in catching sa\u00faba and Nile \ntilapia (31.1% of the fisheries). Sa\u00faba fishing is done in \nthe outlet of the streams mainly for subsistence. Because \nof this, the castnets (tarrafas) are smaller (tarrafinha), \nwith an average mesh size of 2.7 cm between opposite \nknots and an average height of 1.8 meters. \n\nCastnets used in tilapia fishing are the only ones \nwhich were made legal by the Brazilian Institute of the \n\nEnvironment and the Renewable Natural Resources \n(IBAMA) in December, 1???. These castnets have an av-\nerage mesh size of 7.14 cm between opposite knots, an \naverage height of 2.8 m and a diameter of 21.8 m. \n\nThe nets are usually bought at U$ 1.03/mr (n = 28, \ns = 0.3?) and the castnets and tarrafinhas can be made or \nbought costing U$ 48.57 on average (n = 35, s = 15.72). \n\n3.2.6. The landings\n\nThe total amount of fish caught at the Lago Parano\u00e1 \nfrom March, 1??? to March, 2000 was 62.50 tons in \n1,4?8 trips (41.7 kg/trip; s = 26.43, minimum = 0.00, \nmaximum=170). The most captured species was the \nNile tilapia (84.?%), followed by the common carp, \n11.1%, Congo tilapia 2.2%, tra\u00edra 1.0% and 0.8% of the \nother species (Table 6). The total catch varied month-\nly (Figure 3). On average, 21.4 fishers were active per \nmonth (s = 12.37) in 115 fisheries (s = 41.56). The aver-\nage yield was of 224.7 kg/fisher/month. \n\nThe sa\u00faba were not sorted out, except in those cases \nwhere the fishers differentiated all the species. Therefore, \nit does not correspond to catching saguir\u00fa exactly.\n\nConsidering the total area of the lake is 3,800 hec-\ntares, the fishing productivity of the reservoir is \n16.4 kg.ha-1.year-1. \n\nThe weight of the landing proportions in 1,4?8 \nfishing trips was: Vila Parano\u00e1 (4?.4% of a total of \n62,500 kg), followed by Buraco (38.4%) and Vila da \nTelebras\u00edlia (10.?%). \n\n3.3. Fish commercialization \n\nMost of the time, fish is directly sold to the consumers \n(84.?%, n = 53) in fairs (6?.8%, n = 53) or in the streets \n(4?.1%, n = 53) of the satellite-towns and municipal \ndistricts of the State of Goi\u00e1s. Selling it at fairs usually \nhappens at the weekends, mainly on Sundays. On other \ndays of the week, the fishers sell the fish in the streets. \nFish is also sold to middlemen (37.7%). The fish sold to \nmiddlemen or to consumers may take place by the lake \n(7.5%) or in houses (35.8%). There are two cases where \nfishers supply bars with fish. However, throughout the \nresearch it was observed that the fish buyers or the bars \nalways resell the fish directly to the consumers and many \nbar owners buy the fish from middlemen for more acces-\nsible prices. Therefore, between the fisher and consumer, \nthere are at least two more people. \n\nThe price and the way to sell fish vary according to \nthe buyer\u00b4s type and the fish species. The tilapias and \n\nTable 5.

On average, the average price of \nthe tilapia sold directly to the consumer was U$ 1.23/kg \n(n = 24, s = 0.37) and U$ 1.52/string (n = 20, s = 0.45). \n\nCarp is sold in a similar way. Its final average cost was \nU$ 2.06/string (n = 12, s = 2.06) or U$ 1.24/kilo (n = 21, \ns = 0.37). The tra\u00edra and the tucunar\u00e9 are sold by the kilo \nto the consumer for an average price of U$ 1.74 (n = 23, \ns = 0.3?) and U$1.?? (n = 12, s = 0.45), respectively. On \naverage, the sa\u00faba costs U$ 1.?4/kilo (n = 20, s = 0.67). \nThe fish is sold to the middlemen in cans or by kilogram. \n\nTable 6.

On average, a \ntilapia can costs U$ 7.58 (n = 11, s = 2.0?) and carp costs \nU$ 7.?3 (n = 7, s = 2.02). Many fishers said they sold \nmixed fish to middlemen and the value of a can increased \naccording to the number of tra\u00edras and tucunar\u00e9s it con-\ntained. When sold to the middlemen in kilogram, the price \nof the fish varied between U$ 0.28 and U$ 1.11. \n\nSome fishers removed tra\u00edra and tucunar\u00e9 for their \nown consumption or it was given to relatives or neigh-\nbours. Only four fishers reported selling tra\u00edra to middle-\nmen for U$ 1.18/kg (s = 0.7?). \n\n3.4. Differences presented by the fishing communities in \nrelation to fishing strategies and marketing \n\nThroughout the work, it was observed that the com-\nmunities had different strategies regarding the equipment \nused, the area of the lake used for fishing, the period of \nday when fishing took place and the kind of commer-\ncialization areas. \n\nFor instance, the community of Buraco only fishes at \nthe southern end of the lake. When this was illegal, they \nused batida at night. After it was made legal in February, \n2000 they started fishing with castnets in the daytime and \nat night (Table 7).\n\nThe Parano\u00e1 community used all the areas of the lake \nto fish, mainly the central area. Their strategies consisted \nof fishing at night, only with batida. \n\nThe Vila da Telebras\u00edlia community fishes mainly \nwith castnets and some fishers also use gillnets and bat-\n\nTable 7.

J. Biol., 67(1): 9-21, 200716\n\nida. The fishing area is mainly at the southern end of the \nlake and people fish mainly during the day. \n\nRegarding commercialization, it was also observed \nthat places and different ways of selling are used by \neach one of the communities. For instance, when Vila \nParano\u00e1\u2019s fishers sell fish directly in the streets, they sell \nit in strings and the main place is in the Vila itself. Most \nof the fishers there sell eviscerated fish to the middlemen \nand they measure it in kilograms. In this community, \nthere is a third group that sells fish in fairs by kilogram, \nmainly in Planaltina town. Fishers commented that when \nthe fish buyer does not show up, they sell the fish on \nthe streets of Parano\u00e1, Gama or Santa Maria. Gama was \nmentioned as the best place. The fish buyers that buy the \nfish in Parano\u00e1 resell it in Parano\u00e1 itself, in Santa Maria, \nGama and Luzi\u00e2nia (Figure 1). \n\nThe fishers in Buraco sell fish on the streets (main-\nly in Ceil\u00e2ndia - Figure 1) in strings or to the middle-\nmen and bar owners in cans. Trade is mostly done in \nCeil\u00e2ndia, Parque das Emas or in \u00c1guas Lindas, areas \nwhere they live (Figure 1). In fairs, it is sold in Ceil\u00e2ndia \nor in \u00c1guas Lindas. \n\nThe fishers in Vila da Telebras\u00edlia sell fish mainly in \nfairs in Pedregal, Gama and C\u00e9u Azul (Figure 1). They \nrarely sell fish to middlemen, but when they do the fish \nis sold in cans. \n\n3.5. Income \n\nIn Figure 4, the calculated monthly income to the \ncommunity is shown. This information is the financial \nresult of the different community strategies related to \nfishing and fish commercialization. For this analysis, the \ninformation was considered according to the community \nthe fishers belong to, the fishing equipment, payment \nto the other crew members, how often people fished, \nmonthly catches and the number of months in which \nfishing took place. \n\nThe monthly average income was U$ 238.73 \n(s = 171.77), however the results demonstrate that there \n\nis a significant difference among the incomes of the three \ncommunities (p = 0.0135), where the monthly income of \nVila Parano\u00e1\u2019s community (U$ 362.18, s = 184.17) is sig-\nnificantly higher than Vila da Telebras\u00edlia (U$ = 131.18, \ns = 131.68, p = 0.0202). The monthly income of Buraco \n(U$ = 2?4.52, s = 116.78) does not differ from the in-\ncome of Parano\u00e1 (p = 0.72) and Telebras\u00edlia (p = 0.12), \n(Figure 4).\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Professional fishers \n\nAssessing the fish stock does not only mean evaluat-\ning the catch and the income. It is important to focus \non the information from fishers and the market system, \nwhich governs the catch per unit of effort, as well as the \nbiological characteristics of the species and to recog-\nnize that the fishers are the political centre of the fish-\nery. Moreover, profit is what measures the success of the \nmanagement (Hilborn and Walters, 1??2). \n\nUnderstanding the socioeconomic reality of the fish-\ners is of great importance, as far as implementing meas-\nures of fish stock management are concerned as well as \nthe economic development of these populations. Bazigos \n(1?74) recommends doing censuses in order to find out \nthe population of fishers in tropical areas of difficult ac-\ncess, so that afterwards a data collection system can be \nmade on the statistics of fish which have landed. \n\nIn Lago Parano\u00e1, the importance of studying the re-\nality of professional fishers entails understanding how \nmuch involved they are in society and in the job market, \nwhere a regulated fishery can create jobs in the Federal \nDistrict (Paviani, 1??2). \n\nAlthough professional fishers are concentrated in \nfour main communities (Figure 2), they belong to several \nareas of the Federal District and its surrounding towns \nwhich are the poorest according to official statistics \n(CODEPLAN, 1??7). \n\nThe small estimated number of fishers in each one \nof the administrative regions (AR) does not allow us to \nmake comparisons between the places where the fishers \nbelong. However, a general analysis can be made evalu-\nating the fishers as a single group, as well as the situa-\ntion of the population of the administrative regions to \nwhich they belong. It is important to point out that there \nare no official statistics in the towns from the State of \nGoi\u00e1s (which surround the Federal District) and Vila da \nTelebras\u00edlia. \n\nIn the general context of the Federal District, the \naverage size of a family is of 4.15 members. The most \nnumerous families live in Santa Maria (4.57 members) \nand Riacho Fundo (4.40 members, CODEPLAN, (1??7), \nsmaller than the average fisher\u2019s families (4.? members). \n\nThe poor education level of a population restricts its \nemployment opportunities because the job market is in-\ncreasingly more complex (Borges, 1??7). The level of \neducation in the Federal District is comparatively low, \nwhere 40.?% do not reach the first degree (CODEPLAN, \n\nFigure 4. Gross average monthly income of the three studied \ncommunities. \n\nFishermen community\n\nM\non\n\nth\n i\n\nnc\nom\n\ne \n(U\n\n$)\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nBuraco Parano\u00e1 Telebras\u00edlia\n\nn = 6\n\nn = 6\n\nn = 10\n\n\u00b1 1.96*Std.

In poorer villages, this situation is even worse. \nIn Brazil\u00e2ndia town, 81.8% of the heads of the fami-\nlies do not have basic education, in Recanto das Emas \n81.2%, in Samambaia 7?.06%, in Planaltina 78.6%, in \nCeil\u00e2ndia 77.6% and in Parano\u00e1 ?0% (CODEPLAN, \n1??7). Professional fishers are in this situation, as they \nare more likely to be unemployed (Paviani, 1??2). \n\nThe time of residence of fishers is higher in relation \nto the rest of the population of the DF: 35.3% have lived \nthere from 0 to ? years, 2?% from 10 to 1? years, 22.7% \nfrom 20 to 2? years and 13.0% has lived there for more \nthan thirty years (CODEPLAN. 1??7). From the inter-\nviewees, only 11.5% were born in the DF, which is a \nlow figure when compared to the rest of the population \n(43.?%), (CODEPLAN, 1??7). However, the official \nstatistics refer to the whole population and not just to \nthe heads of families, who do not consider their children \nwho were born in the capital.\n\nHouses are owned by 46.0% of the families in the \nDF, 37.2% live in somebody else\u2019s properties and 10.8% \nof the population occupies dubious land: they are owners \nof their houses, but not of the plots of land. Therefore, \nthey are a typical case of the establishments promoted by \nthe government for the poor (CODEPLAN, 1??7). Most \nfishers claimed to live in their own houses. 41.6% of the \npopulation of the DF lives in houses, which are at most \n60 m2. This situation is worse in the Recanto das Emas \n(77.5%), S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (66.7%), Planaltina (64.?%), \nParano\u00e1 (63.4%), Samambaia (61.7%) and Santa Maria \n(61.6%), (CODEPLAN, 1??7). 40.4% of fishers live in \nareas of up to 60 m2, which is an improvement than the \nrest of the DF, putting them in a minority class in relation \nto the average of RAs in which they live. However, this \nreality is regardless of the size, because concerning the \nmaterial used in the construction, the DF has: i) 6?.1% \nof masonry houses, 17.7% are apartments and 10.2% \nhuts (CODEPLAN, 1??7); ii) 3?.4% of the houses have \nceramic floors and 3?.8% cement, reaching 60% of the \nhouses in the RAs whose population has a smaller pur-\nchasing power; iii) asbestos tile floors (72.4%), followed \nby mud floors (13.8%); and iv) the sanitary facilities are \ncollective in 6.4% of the homes in the DF (CODEPLAN, \n1??7). The houses of the fishers are among the most pre-\ncarious, however the number of fishers who use collec-\ntive bathrooms is smaller. \n\nBesides being one of a citizen\u2019s fundamental rights, \nhousing is the centre of sociability where organization of \nthe family takes place. However, the quality of the house \ndepends not only on intrinsic factors such as education \nand income, but also on sanitary facilities provided by \npublic policies and ecological characteristics of the area \n(Borges, 1??7). Electric power supply, water, sewage \nand garbage collection are public services for most of \nthe DF population (CODEPLAN, 1??7). This condition \nis above the national average (IBGE, 1??6) and it reflects \nthe high degree of urbanization of the fishers and their \ndependence on public policies (in this case we can in-\nclude the situation of land concession). \n\nThe fish in Lago Parano\u00e1 is comparatively important \n(Table 5) as it is more consumed than in the Represa \nBillings, where 87% of the families of fishers consume \nthe fish from the reservoir twice a week on average \n(Minte-Vera et al., 1??7). In two reservoirs in the Igua\u00e7u \nRiver in the State of Paran\u00e1, the number of fish is low, as \n41.4% of the fishers\u2019 families consume fish once a week \n(Okada et al., 1??7). When studying the community of \nthe Mina d\u2019\u00c1gua (an invaded land that existed in 1?85 \nclose to the Lago Parano\u00e1), Dias (1??4) pointed out that \nthe fish in the reservoir was the only source of protein for \nmany families. Petrere (1??5) also points out the impor-\ntance of fish in the fishers\u00b4 diet, where in urban reservoirs \nsuch as the Lago Parano\u00e1 (DF), the dam Billings (SP) \nand the Lagoa da Pampulha (MG), it is their only source \nof protein. \n\nPayne (2000) considers that small-scale fishers come \nstrictly from rural communities. However, in the Lago \nParano\u00e1, the fishers come from urban communities. \nThis situation was also observed by Nehrer and Begossi \n(2000), where small-scale fishers from Posto Seis in \nCopacabana come from the slums of Rio de Janeiro \ncity. Minte-Vera et al. (1??7) argue that Reservat\u00f3rio \nBillings\u2019s fishers come from the metropolitan area of S\u00e3o \nPaulo, which is also urban. \n\nAcheson (1?81) points out that in industrial fisheries \nthere is a division of work: while the men fish, women \nare responsible for the housework. Minte-Vera et al. \n(1??7) also argue that 16.4% of the fishers from Billings \nare women, including fishing as a whole: they handle all \nthe equipment, hire assistants and own their own produc-\ntion and most of the time they are independent from the \nfishermen\n\nIn Lago Parano\u00e1, the presence of a class of younger \nfishers, consisting mainly of fisher\u2019s children shows that \nthere is continuity in fishing. All these fishers said that \nthey were previously assistants of their parents when \nfishing. However, in spite of the high participation of \nthe family in fishing, there is no work division in Lake \nParano\u00e1 by age or sex. \n\n4.2. The fisheries \n\n4.2.1. Dedication to fishing \n\nThe group of fishers that are devoted exclusively to \nfishing in a given place shows not only its cultural impor-\ntance, but also that fisheries supply the need of income \nto a family. In the Lago Parano\u00e1, the proportion of fish-\ners who fish exclusively is low, mainly compared to the \nRepresa Billings, where 87.3% of the fishers only live \nfrom the fisheries (Minte-Vera et al., 1??7). However, \nthe small number of fishers and their decrease through-\nout the months is attributed to the secrecy of the fishing. \nIn two reservoirs in Igua\u00e7\u00fa River, where fishing is pro-\nhibited, only 6.7% of the fishers live exclusively from \nfishing (Okada et al., 1??7). However, there is no time \nbetween harvests in Lago Parano\u00e1. \n\nWhen we refer to the poor population, its inclusion \nin the job market makes it possible to understand it on \n\n\n\nWalter, T. and Petrere Jr., M.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 67(1): 9-21, 200718\n\nan individual level. Jobs are very important because they \nare the main source of income of the poorest population \n(Baltar and Dequech Fo, 1??0). The more precarious the \nway an individual is seen in the job market, the larger \nthe difference between his/her income and the necessary \nincome to satisfy his/her basic needs. As a consequence, \nthe larger his/her dependence is in relation to other as-\npects: public attendance, attendance of private and fa-\nmiliar institutions (Troyano, 1??0). The three groups of \ndistinguished fishers reflect this situation. Only 3?.6% \nof the fishers are devoted to fishing, the others stopped \ndue to low qualification jobs, reflecting the difficulty in \nthe job market. This is the general situation of inequality \nin modern Brazil, which is even worse in Bras\u00edlia where \njobs are not very diversified (Costa, 1??2). \n\n4.2.2. Fishing economic resource\n\nThe professional fisheries in Lago Parano\u00e1 have gen-\neral attributes of small-scale fisheries: a small number of \ncrew members who are usually partners, some of whom \nhave friendly relationships; they have boats without en-\ngines; very defined strategies and some are very knowl-\nedgeable fishers (Bayley and Petrere, 1?8?; Petrere, \n1?8?; Fischer et al., 1??2; Diegues, 1??5). Tomanik \n(1??7) points out that the community from Porto Rico \n(PR) fish in pairs in a partnership system. Everything is \ndivided and shared. Even the boat and most of the equip-\nment belong to one of the partners and this is not taken \ninto account when sharing out the earnings or respon-\nsibilities. Partnerships are usually set up among fishers, \nwho have already had vast experience in fishing and who \nhave some kind of fishing equipment. Another type of re-\nlationship is established when there is a difference of age, \nprofessional experience and ownership. In these cases, \nthe oldest fisher can hire a younger assistant, who has lit-\ntle experience and still does not have his own equipment. \nHe is paid a percentage without any expenses. \n\nThe fishing economic resource (Bazigos, 1?74) in \nLago Parano\u00e1 is a wooden canoe with one or two castnets. \nTherefore, the initial investment in fishing is U$ 184.55 \nfor gillnet fishing and U$ 87.22 for castnet fishing. It is \na low investment when compared to other places, mainly \nthose that use motorized boats. In the lower part of the \nS\u00e3o Francisco River, the price of an aluminium boat is \nU$ 1,317.15, a wooden one costs U$ 35?.64, the en-\ngine costs U$ 1,165.72, the caceia net costs U$ 473.48, \nthe gillnet costs U$ 122.11 and the castnet U$ 145,16 \n(Camargo and Petrere, 2001). In the reservoir in Itaip\u00fa in \nthe State of Paran\u00e1, the average cost for full equipment is \nU$ 818 (Agostinho et al., 1??4). However, the compara-\ntively low investment in fishing in Lago Parano\u00e1 is due to \nconstantly replacing material and to inspections, which \ndoes not encourage the fisher to invest more. On the other \nhand, the small amount of equipment per fisher and the \nuse of paddle canoes reduce the number of fishers. \n\n4.2.3. The species which are caught\n\nThere are few species of fish in the small-scale fish-\neries in Lago Parano\u00e1 and the Nile Tilapia represents \n\n84.?% of the haul in weight, followed by the common \nCarp (11.1%) and the Congo Tilapia (2.21%, Table 7).\n\nIn many other places in the tropical world, small-\nscale fisheries are sustained by these species (Fernando, \n1??1; Fernando and Holcik, 1??1). In Colombia, in \nHonduras and in the Dominican Republic, the Nile \nTilapia is the species which is caught most (FAO, 2003). \nIn the Brazilian Northeastern dams, when Tilapias were \nintroduced, they increased the fishing productivity of \nthese reservoirs, ranging from 18 to 667 kg.ha-1.year-1 \n(Paiva et al., 1??4). In 2000, 231 thousand tons were \ncaught worldwide (FAO, 2003). \n\nIn Java, there are reservoirs with very high produc-\ntion, for instance, a lake of 25 hectares has a productivity \nfrom 500 to 600 kg.ha-1, mostly consisting of Cyprinus \ncarpio (data compiled by Lowe-McConnell, 1??1). The \nfisheries in Lake Tana in Ethiopia is confined to the \nGolf of Bahir with a low production of 4 kg.ha-1.year-1. \nThere are two main types of fishing: i) a small-scale \nsubsistence fishery, consisting of papyrus canoes mainly \ncatching Nile Tilapia and Barbel Barbus tsanensis and \nii) motorized fishing, which catches Barbus sp and the \nAfrican catfish Clarias gariepinus (Wudneh, 1??8). \nSince 1?52 in Sri Lanka, the Tilapia Oreochromis mos-\nsambicus is the most important species in inland fisher-\nies with an estimated productivity ranging from 270 to \n300 kg.ha-1.year-1 (Pet, 1??5). The Tilapia Oreochromis \naureus and the Cyprinidae family are the main produce \nin Cuban reservoirs (Quir\u00f3s and Mari, 1???). \n\nThe composition of the haul in Lago Parano\u00e1\u00b4s pro-\nfessional fisheries differs from the experimental gillnet \nfishing carried out by Lazzaro et al. (1??8), where the \ncommon carp was more abundant (23.4% from a total \nof 342.6 kg) followed by the Nile Tilapia (18.8%). The \nexplanation is due to the castnets used in the profession-\nal fisheries, equipment which was not used by Lazzaro \net al. (1??8) in their sampling. \n\nThe low richness and high species dominance ob-\nserved in the Lago Parano\u00e1 fish community is indicative \nof communities who suffer from stress, which is due to \ni) the transformation of a lotic ecosystem to a lentic one; \nii) the posterior eutrophization; and iii) the introduction \nof species (Magurran, 1?88). \n\n4.3. Commercialization \n\nSelling fish in the Lago Parano\u00e1 has many particu-\nlar aspects. The first consists of not having a real by-\ncatch where the other species have a market value or are \nsold together with the Tilapias. This rarely happens in \nother fisheries, such as Minte-Vera and Petrere (2000). \nThe fisheries in Reservat\u00f3rio Billings point out that the \ncaborja Hoplosternum littorale is not well accepted, even \nin bad season fisheries. \n\nA second interesting aspect is the fisher who takes the \nbest fish for his own consumption. This could be a conse-\nquence of not catching many of these species associated \nto the highly valued Tilapia. However, the most important \naspect of the commercialization system in Lago Parano\u00e1 \nwas attributed to fishers who are owners of their own \n\n\n\nFisheries in Lago Parano\u00e1 (DF)\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 67(1): 9-21, 2007 1?\n\nproduction. Therefore, these fishers do not depend on the \nmiddlemen providing them with food (the fishing trips are \nlocal and short) and paying for their fishing equipment. \nThe choice between directly selling to the consumer or \nto the middlemen is free, and therefore the price obtained \nfor their fish is higher than many of the Brazilian reser-\nvoirs, even if commercialization is represented mainly by \na single species, which is the Nile Tilapia. In the Represa \nBillings, for example, Tilapia is sold filleted (four kilos of \nfish is needed for a kilo of filet, Minte-Vera and Petrere, \n2000) and is sold to the middlemen for U$ 1.55. The \nfish which reaches the highest prices in the reservoir at \nSobradinho (4,200 km2) in the State of Bahia was sold for \nU$ 1.50 the kilo to the middlemen (Agostinho, 1??7). \n\nIn the middle part of the S\u00e3o Francisco River, sell-\ning takes place by an unjust income distribution where \nfishers only receive 5% of the final price of their product. \nThe consumers have to pay for the costs of quite com-\nplex a chain of middlemen (PROJETO BRA/?0/005). \n\nIn the Northeastern dams selling depends on middle-\nmen where the participation of the fisher in the final price \nof the fish is 28% (PROJETO BRA/?0/005). \n\nOn the other hand, fishers or at the most two mid-\ndlemen at the Lago Parano\u00e1 set their price. Fish is not \nexported to other federations, as it is supplied fresh at an \naccessible price to the local population. It is cheaper than \nmost of the original fish from other places and the fish-\ners are paid more. This situation is due to fact that Lago \nParano\u00e1 is the only appropriate fishing waterbody in the \nFederal District and its population consumes a larger \namount of fish (12.8 kg.capita-1.year-1) in relation to the \nBrazilian average (5.8 kg.capita-1.year-1), (PROGRAM \nOF FISH FARMING OF DF, unpublished). The DF \nimports 4,000 tons of fish a year (Rui Donizzeti \u2013 civil \nservant from the Ministry of Agriculture \u2013 Fish Farming \nProject of the DF \u2013 personal communication to TW, \n1???) and the fish caught in Lago Parano\u00e1 represents less \nthan 2% of its total consumption.\n\nA final aspect, which is a consequence of fishers sell-\ning directly in streets and fairs, is also an important so-\ncial role which encourages solidarity and possibly comes \nfrom small rural communities. It involves exchang-\ning their production with people in the neighborhood. \nAmoroso (1?81) points out that in the poor outskirts of \nManaus, donating or exchanging food is common, main-\nly in poor families. \n\n4.4. The monthly income \n\nIncome generated by fishing is a consequence of the \nstrategies used by fishers and the decisive social function \nof fisheries (Hilborn and Walters, 1??2). \n\nThe monthly income is higher in Vila Parano\u00e1 \n(U$ 362.18) in relation to Vila da Telebras\u00edlia \n(U$ 131.18), possibly due to most of the fishers from \nParano\u00e1 fishing full time, even if most sell the fish for \nsmaller prices. The Vila da Telebras\u00edlia community tends \nto fish as well as doing other activities. The Buraco com-\nmunity has an income of U$ 2?4.52, although it is not \nsignificantly different from the other two. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the income of Lago \nParano\u00e1\u2019s fishers is high, when compared to other \nBrazilian reservoirs, as the productivity and the amount \nof fishers is larger and they have species which are ac-\ncepted more on the market. In the Sobradinho reservoir, \nfor example, the monthly income of the fishers who fish \nin the most productive areas is U$ 375.21 (Agostinho, \n1??7). In Billings reservoir, where the main fish species \nis also the Nile Tilapia, 34% of the fishers said they had a \nbasic income of U$ 105.00 to U$ 210.00 (Minte-Vera and \nPetrere, 2000). Cetra and Petrere (2001) calculated that \nthe daily income of the professional fishers of the middle \npart of the Tocantins River was U$ 2.00. They attributed \nthis low income due to the middlemen who control the \nmeans of production. Okada et al. (1??7) calculated that \nthe income of the fishers from two reservoirs in the Igua\u00e7\u00fa \nRiver is U$ 12.00/day. The monthly profit of fishing in the \nItaip\u00fa reservoir is only U$ 25.00 (Agostinho et al., 1??4). \nHowever, in these places fishing is done on motorized ca-\nnoes, there is a supply of ice, freezers and more equipment \nused by each fisher, which increases his/her costs. \n\nA second interesting comparison is to evaluate the in-\ncome with the average values of social groups IV and V \n(CODEPLAN, 1??7) to which these fishers belong. In this \nsituation, even if fishing is the only source of the family\u2019s \nincome, the family would have the same living standards \nof other non-fishing families, and therefore if fishing was \nregularized, it would be economically sustainable.\n\n5. Conclusions \n\nSmall-scale fishing has been present at the Lago \nParano\u00e1 ever since it was built. The fishers have adapted \ncatching the fish species according to its evolution, pre-\nsenting different strategies, according to the community \nthey belong to: Vila da Telebras\u00edlia, Buraco, Vila Parano\u00e1 \nand ETE Norte. \n\nAmong the poorest population in the Federal District, \nthe fishers have a source of income as well as cheap pro-\ntein and the important task of supplying it to the rest of \nthe population. The sale may not be in cash and donating \nfish is quite common.\n\nAlthough some of it is illegal, the annual catch has \nreached 62.5 tons with an income of 41.7 kg.fishery-1 \nequivalent to 224.7 kg.fisher-1.month-1 and a productivity \nof 15.4 kg.ha-1.year-1. Therefore, low productivity in fish-\ning is due to its secrecy: i) where it is not worth investing \nin fishing material; ii) there is a limit to catching and ef-\nfort from which it is not worth running the risk of having \nthe material confiscated by inspectors; and iii) there are \nno landing facilities, freezers and supply of ice, which \nwould limit catching the fish and increase fishing costs. \n\nThe high amount of tilapias and carps, which are \ncaught, is a consequence of them being dominant in this \nreservoir and the fact that appropriate catching strategies \nare used. \n\nSelling fish is mainly the responsibility of the fisher, \nas he/she owns cheap fishing equipment and is free to \nchoose to whom he/she sells the fish. \n\n\n\nWalter, T. and Petrere Jr., M.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 67(1): 9-21, 200720\n\nProductivity together with the added value given by \nthe fish, as well as a high demand/offer, makes fishing \nprofitable when compared to small-scale fishing else-\nwhere, and is a good job alternative. Therefore, the pro-\nfessional fisheries at Lago Parano\u00e1 have particular char-\nacteristics compared to other inland Brazilian fisheries. \n\nThe fishery also has pleasant environmental and so-\ncial requirements: the catch in weight of alien species is \n?8% of the total; the Tilapias caught by castnet are ben-\neficial in order to control algae; the fishers come from the \npoor population and fishing is profitable economically. \nThe cultural aspects of fishing can still be seen as part of \nthe patrimony of the capital city of Bras\u00edlia. \n\nAcknowledgments \u2014 This paper is a result of a MSc dissertation \nby TW advised by MPJr at CHREA (Centro de Recursos \nH\u00eddricos e Ecologia Aplicada), USP/ S\u00e3o Carlos.
