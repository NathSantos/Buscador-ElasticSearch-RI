A amostragem decorreu durante as campanhas M2005 (64PE237), M2006 (64PE253) e M2007 (64PE268), a bordo do NO Pelagia. Foram analisadas 120 subamostras de box-core recolhidas a profundidades entre os 220 e 900 m, nas quais foram identificados 426 taxa de macroinvertebrados. As comunidades de macrofauna revelaram ser altamente heterog\u00e9neas a n\u00edvel de composi\u00e7\u00e3o e estutura, sendo maioritariamente representadas por artr\u00f3podes, anel\u00eddeos e moluscos.

It encompasses numerous carbonate mounds characterised by accumulations of mostly fossil deepwater corals, isolated coral patches and coral rubble, and over 40 submarine mud volcanoes at depths ranging 200 to 4,000m. This tectonically active area has a long geologic history and a central biogeographic location. The complex circulation of water masses ensures oceanographic connectivity with the Mediterranean Sea, Equatorial and North Atlantic regions. At the Gulf of Cadiz, the Pen Duick Escarpment, a feature with 4 km length and 100 m height, is located at ca. 500 m depth, on the south-eastern branch of the Renard Ridge, westwards of the El Arraiche mud volcano field. Cold-water corals, vulnerable, slow-growing metazoans that inhabit cold dark waters in the deep-sea, have been receiving increased attention in recent years. Under the framework of the research programs MiCROSYSTEMS and Moundforce (European Science Foundation), selected sites along the Moroccan margin were investigated, aiming to describe the composition, abundance and community structure of the benthic macrofaunal assemblages living in association with fossil cold-water coral reef habitats present in the vicinity of mud volcanoes and carbonate mounds. Sampling was undertaken during the cruises M2005 (64PE237), M2006 (64PE253) and M2007 (64PE268), onboard the RV Pelagia. From the 120 box-core subsamples collected at depths ranging 220 to 900 m, 426 macroinvertebrate taxa were identified. The macrofaunal assemblages were highly heterogeneous in composition and community structure and were mainly represented by arthropods, annelids and molluscs. Multivariate analyses supported significant differences between distinct geological features and between distinct substrate types. High diversity, abundance and evenness were common in mound, coral and mud volcano assemblages, whilst off mound sediments and areas without hard substrates were represented by less diverse and less abundant assemblages. The assemblages are dominated by a relatively low percentage of the most common taxa and include mainly polychaetes, sipunculids and tanaidaceans. Analysis in relation to depth also revealed differences in taxa richness and abundance. The results obtained are discussed in relation to previous knowledge on carbonate mounds, fossil coral reefs, El Arraiche mud volcanoes and surrounding area, reinforcing the hypothesis that the presence of carbonate mounds and fossil cold-water coral reefs increases deep-sea habitat heterogeneity and support a highly diverse assemblage of benthic invertebrates.\nINDEX\n1.\tINTRODUCTION..................................................................... 1\n1.1.\tThe deep-sea and the cold-water coral ecosystems............................ 1\n1.2.\tCold-water corals: fragile havens in the deep............................... 2\n1.3.\tHabitat complexity of cold-water corals..................................... 7\n1.4.\tCold-water coral associated assemblages..................................... 9\n1.5.\tVulnerability of deep-water corals......................................... 12\n1.6.\tStudy context and objectives............................................... 14\n2.\tMETHODOLOGY..................................................................... 17\n2.1.\tStudy area................................................................. 17\n2.2.\tSampling methodology....................................................... 19\n2.3.\tData analysis.............................................................. 23\n3.\tRESULTS......................................................................... 27\n3.1.\tMultivariate analysis...................................................... 28\n3.2.\tSpecies richness........................................................... 31\n3.3.\tDensity.................................................................... 33\n3.4.\tDiversity indices.......................................................... 36\n3.5.\tDiversity partitioning..................................................... 38\n3.6.\tSpecies contributions...................................................... 41\n4.\tDISCUSSION...................................................................... 43\n4.1.

This undiscovered world constitutes one of the last great wildernesses on Earth: through the early 20th century knowledge on the marine realm was mostly confined to a small number of intellectual curiosity seekers and deep-sea explorers. Therefore, the deep ocean constitutes the most poorly sampled habitat on Earth and patterns of diversity and distribution of the majority of species remain largely unresolved (Yesson et al., 2012). In spite of more than 150 years of exploration, the ocean depths remain virtually unknown due to the technological challenges and financial resources required to explore this environment. However, decreasing opportunities in coastal waters led industries to explore the deep ocean for new resources: deepwater fisheries developed, petrochemical industries moved deeper into continental slope waters, and mineral extraction from deep-ocean sites became feasible (Roberts, 2002).\nBiological science has so far touched upon only one millionth of the deep-sea floor, but, with improved deep-water technology and societal interest, our knowledge of the deep-sea grew considerably during the past decades. Science discovered that habitats previously considered devoid of life were areas of high biodiversity; new underwater technology revealed remarkable new and exotic habitats such as exuberant hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, gas hydrates, massive sulphide deposits and cold-water coral reefs, which harbour diverse and unique faunas. One of the most spectacular events in the investigation of the European continental margin during the last decade has been the discovery of the giant carbonate mounds along the Celtic margin; in depths of 700-1,000 m, these up to 300 m high carbonate build-ups composed of cold-water coral fragments embedded in a loose matrix of hemipelagic sediments are covered by extensive coral reefs (Wehrmann et al., 2011).\nCold-water coral mounds and reefs are large areas of coral accumulation; these biogenic features have been known to occur in the deep-sea for centuries, firstly attracting the attention of only local fishermen and a small global community of biologists and geologists. Although their existence was first documented over 250 years ago, it was only in the 1990s that research on these ecosystems received a new impetus (Freiwald et al. 2004; Wienberg et al., 2009). Recently, with the development of increasingly sophisticated and efficient modern technologies, such as manned and remote operated submersibles, advanced acoustics survey techniques, sonar, bottom landers, mini-submarines, and production of high quality images by underwater video photography, scientists around the globe have finally been able to explore, study and map deepsea coral communities in their natural environment (Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004; Roberts et al.,\n1\n2006; Turley et al., 2007). Astonishing images of deep-sea corals living at depths from surface down to more than 1,000 m are now available, and have led many countries to initiate the assessment of the distribution, status, health, ecology, and potential threats faced by these ecosystems (Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Hall-Spencer et al., 2002; Lophelia, 2012; Roberts, 2002).\nCold-water coral ecosystems are emerging as systems of ecological and economic value, raising concern over their rapid destruction. The structural complexity of these ecosystems harbours a yet unknown number of different species, including large numbers of commercially important fish species. Therefore, deep-sea corals (as well as sponge aggregations) appear to be important biodiversity hotspots in the oceans and provide vital resources for fisheries, bioprospecting, science and education (Baillon et al., 2012; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; WWF, 2004). In addition, benefits to humans derived from deep-sea corals such as direct goods and services are just beginning to be explored: marine natural products constitute a diverse group of biomedically important compounds that gave a new impetus to the search for bioactive substances produced by living organisms and useful genes. Cold-water Cnidaria and Porifera were, historically, among the first marine animals to be chemically studied and constitute a largely untapped resource of natural products with enormous potential as pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, enzymes, pesticides, cosmetics, and other commercial products (Freiwald et al., 2004; Lebar et al., 2007; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004).\nDue to their longevity over geological time scales, cosmopolitan distributions, and banded skeletal structure, some deep-sea corals can also serve as important paleoenvironmental archives. They reflect temporal variations of past climate variables, such as sea surface temperature, salinity or productivity, that are fundamental in reconstructing climate history and understanding global climate change (Roberts et al., 2006; Witherell and Coon, 2001). However, there is still a paucity of information on the basic biology, ecology, abundance and distribution of the numerous species of deep-water corals found in all the world's oceans, because most of them are largely hidden, ignored, and not easily accessible, and thus, difficult to map and sample (Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Kellogg et al., 2009; Thiem et al., 2006).\n1.2.\tCold-water corals: fragile havens in the deep\nWhile most people are aware of tropical corals, few are aware that two-thirds of all known coral species inhabit cold dark waters in the deep oceans. The terms \u201cdeep-sea coral\u201d, \u201ccold-\u201c or \u201cdeep-water coral\u201d have all been used to discriminate these coral frameworks from the famous coral reefs of shallow, warm-water tropical seas (Cairns, 2007; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Rogers, 2004). Unlike tropical corals, the majority of deep-water reef-forming corals are not associated with zooxanthellae (i.e. symbiotic dinoflagellates); therefore, they are termed azooxanthellate (Maier et al., 2009; Turley et al., 2007; Wheeler et al., 2007). Deep-sea corals show great diversity in size, shape, and colour; some are stony and stiff, while others are soft and\n2\nsway with the ocean currents. Some of these construct unexpectedly vast banks, reef structures or giant carbonate mounds, measuring several meters in height and tens of kilometers in length (e.g. Norwegian coast); however, most do not build reefs, but instead smaller scattered and isolated colonies with no more than a few meters in diameter, on small biological topographic build-ups, and others are solitary individuals (Freiwald et al., 2004; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004; Roberts et al., 2006; WWF, 2004).\nAcross the world, over 4,200 species of cold-water corals have been recorded by scientists. Reef-building and habitat-forming corals in cold waters are derived from several taxonomic groups belonging to the phylum Cnidaria. Corals belonging to the class Anthozoa (\u201ctrue corals\u201d) can be further divided into the subclasses Hexacorallia and Octocorallia (soft corals); hexacorals include the order Scleractinia (the colonial \u201cstony corals\", that constitute the focus of this study) which build the hard, calcium-based reefs most commonly associated with corals (Freiwald et al., 2004; Lindner et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2006; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004; WWF, 2004). The most widespread and best-studied stony coral is Lophelia pertusa, an azooxanthellate, colonial cold-water coral that was first described from the North-East Atlantic in the mid-18th century by Linnaeus (1758). The name Lophelia derives from the Greek \"lophos\" and \"helioi\", meaning 'a tuft of suns', referring to the individual sun-like coral polyps, evident in Figure 1 (Lophelia, 2012; Roberts et al., 2003). Its robust skeletons form massive, highly branched bushlike colonies that can measure few centimeters to several meters across, consisting of many thousands of translucent coral polyps. As the colony develops, adjacent branches tend to fuse, thereby considerably strengthening the architectural stability of the entire framework (De Mol et. al., 2002; Masson et al., 2003; Reed, 2002).\nDeep-water corals have lower growth rates and longer lifespans than the majority of shallow water corals. Deep-sea reefs take thousands of years to develop and the geological records show that these reefs have existed for millions of years (Turley et al., 2007; Witherell and Coon, 2001). The rate of linear extension of branches of the deep-water scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa varies between 1-26 mm per year and the growth rate of a Lophelia reef is estimated to be 1.3 mm per year, meaning that reefs where the framework thickness is tens of meters thick are thousands or even tens of thousands of years old. Consequently, it will take hundreds of years for a colony to reach a diameter of 1.5-2 m while it will take thousands of years to build a reef structure 10-30 m thick. A 1.5 m high colony of L. pertusa may be up to 366 years of age. Therefore, while individual corals may live only for a few decades or centuries, cold-water coral reefs can be very old. Radiocarbon dating of L. pertusa from the Sula Ridge reef off Norway (the second largest known in the North-Eastern Atlantic) suggests that it has been growing for around 8,600 years, while reefs off the west of Ireland are at least 1.8 to 2 million years old (Fossa et al., 2002; Freiwald et al., 2004; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Mortensen et al., 2001; Rogers, 2004).\n3\nOver time, continual coral growth can produce large reef structures often dominated by Lophelia pertusa but also containing other secondary framework-constructing Scleractinia (Davies et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2005). Like Lophelia sp., corals of the Madrepora group are cosmopolitan, and occur in the same environments. Madrepora oculata (Figure 1) forms branched colonies with a maximum of only 30-50 cm high, which are generally much more fragile and tend to break off easily, thus considerably limiting their capacity to build large frameworks or reefs. Madrepora usually colonises dead and broken Lophelia colonies (De Mol et. al., 2002; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Freiwald and Wilson, 1998; Hansson et al., 2009). These species are often associated with the solitary stony coral Desmophyllum dianthus (Esper, 1974) recently discovered at just 20 m depth in Chilean fjords, Goniocorella dumosa (Alcock, 1902) that builds conical-shaped reefs, Solenosmilia variabilis (Duncan, 1873) which produces tightly-branched reef frameworks, Enallopsammia profunda (Pourtales, 1867) that form massive dendroid colonies up to 1 m thick, and Oculina varicosa (Lesueur, 1821), the \u201civory tree coral\u201d, a species quite unusual because it can occur in both shallow and deep waters (De Haas et al., 2009; Frank et al., 2009; Freiwald et al., 2004; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Rogers, 2004).\nFigure 1. Lophelia pertusa (left) and close-up of Madrepora oculata (right). \u00a9 Diana Catarino, UAzores.\nFrom Hermione (2012).\nThere is evidence that Lophelia pertusa is capable of catching live prey, feeding primarily on live zooplankton of up to 2 cm that drift past the coral framework on currents (eg. calanoid copepods, semi-pelagic crustaceans such as swimming cumaceans and chaetognaths); the polyps are also capable of taking relatively large prey items such as euphausiids. This species appears to be an opportunistic feeder, taking any available nutritious particle; it also feeds on bacteria, protozoans, phytoplankton and flesh particles from different types of marine animals such as fish and mussels (Freiwald et al., 2004; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Mortensen et al., 2001; Roberts et al., 2006; Rogers, 2004). Zooplankton is also a nutritional source for Desmophyllum dianthus, importantly sustaining respiratory metabolism, growth and organic matter release, with further\n4\nimplications for the role of cold-water corals as deep-sea reef ecosystem engineers (Naumann, et al., 2011). Such observations suggest that cold-water corals can have a varied diet and not specialized to one kind of animal food, relying on a food chain supported by high primary surface production. Besides, it has been recognized that bacteria are an important part of their biology, as they play a significant role in the nutrition of their host, influencing its health and distribution (Hansson, et al., 2009; Kellogg et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2003).\nPresent knowledge of deep-water coral reefs distribution is incomplete and is largely based on historic data and on detailed studies of a few species in limited geographic areas; lack of funding and expertise has left large oceanic areas unmapped, potentially hosting unknown reefs (Roberts et al., 2005; WWF, 2004). Despite this, some intriguing patterns in their global biogeography are becoming evident (Roberts et al., 2006). Cold-water coral reefs have been reported in many regions, where they produce complex three-dimensional reef frameworks, but the fairly precise environmental requirements of these organisms mean that they can only form reefs in specific localities (Freiwald et al., 2004; Rogers, 2004).\nCold-water corals are commonly found on the continental margins in a wide range of depth and latitude (Figure 2) (see review in Braga-Henriques, 2013); to date, most studies have been carried out at high latitudes, where cold-water coral communities have been mainly reported from the photic zone to abyssal depths (from 200 to 6,000 m) on the continental shelf and slope (Roberts et al., 2006; Thiem et al., 2006). The outcomes of several research projects over the past 20 years demonstrated that some of these coral species are ubiquitous in the world oceans, but are not known from most of the Arctic Ocean, and others are restricted to only a few locations or even a single place (Cairns, 2007; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004; Wienberg et al., 2009). They have been recorded along the cold-temperate Northeast European Atlantic continental margins and in the South-West Ireland, Scotland and Iberian margin (Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands). There are also records from the Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Cadiz, Senegal and the Cape Verde Islands in West Africa, and in the Western North and South Atlantic (from Nova Scotia and the United States, to the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil). A small number of non-reef records from the Indian and eastern Pacific Oceans was also registered (Freiwald et al., 2004; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Pirlet et al., 2010; Reed, 2002).\nIn the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata are the most abundant reef builders. While the first is usually found in water depths of than 2,000 m, M. oculata occurs with a depth range of ca. 50 to over 1,500 m (De Mol et. al., 2002; Hansson, et al., 2009; Reed, 2002). The shallowest records of Lophelia reefs are in the Norwegian fjords where they have been observed at just 39 m depth on the Tautra Ridge, mid-Trondheimsfjorden and in the New Zealand fjords, due to special conditions that exist in these environments, while the deepest records extend down to 2,775 m in Morocco and to 3,383 m at the New England seamount chain in the North Atlantic (Fossa et al., 2002; Mortensen et al., 2001). The world's\n5\nlargest cold-water coral reef known so far is the R0st reef, southwest of Lofoten Archipelago, northern Norway, which was discovered in 2002. This reef lies in 300-400 m depth, is 43 km long and 2-3 km wide, covering an area of 100 km2, and is primarily built by L. pertusa (Freiwald et al., 2004; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Rogers, 2004; WWF, 2004). It is much larger than the previously largest known reef in water depths of 270 to 310 m at 64SN on the Sula Ridge, off the Norwegian west coast, with approximately 13 km long, 300 m wide and up to 35 m high. These and other Norwegian reefs have the highest densities of L. pertusa corals (Gass and Roberts, 2006; Masson et al., 2003; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004; Thiem et al., 2006).\nFigure 2. Global distribution of cold-water corals: blue points on the map indicate coral reef records around the world, of varying size and stages of development, but not the actual area covered. This map should be regarded as a conservative compilation of locations, as more reefs are being discovered each year. The high density of reefs shown in the North Atlantic most probably reflects the intensity of research in this region. From Hain and Corcoran (2004).\nAlmost all known coral ecosystems share a number of special environmental requirements that control their distribution and growth, such as a suitable hard surface on which to attach (e.g. rock, shells, dead coral framework, glacial boulders, gravel or pebble) (De Haas, et al., 2009; Gass and Roberts, 2006; Masson et al., 2003; Rogers, 2004). These corals live typically in areas with stable physical conditions, under a restricted temperature range recorded between 4 and 14SC, and only occur in waters with salinity values from as low as 32.0 psu in Scandinavian fjords to at least 38.8 psu in the Ionian Sea). Several lines of evidence suggest that ambient oxygen level may also be an important factor in controlling the distribution of these animals in the\n6\nocean (Freiwald et al., 2004; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Mienis et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2003; Wheeler et al., 2007).\nScleractinian corals require an adequate nutrient supply and protection against burial to grow; they are frequently reported in high concentrations from regions where current-seabed topography interactions (e.g. topographic elevations or flow constrictions) generate increased flow velocities close to the seabed (De Mol et. al., 2002; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Masson et al., 2003). As sessile filter feeders, cold-water corals must rely on currents to supply food for nourishment; therefore, they appear to grow preferentially in turbulent hydrodynamic environments with high productivity. Nutrient-rich waters stimulate the development of high phytoplankton and zooplankton levels, providing a major food source for the coral communities and other suspension-feeding organisms (Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Reed, 2002; Thiem et al., 2006). Consequently, they prefer fairly strong and fast directional bottom currents that prevent deposition of sediments and smothering the developing corals and associated fauna, remove waste products, and also keep organic matter in suspension (Davies et al., 2008; Frank et al., 2009; Mienis, et al., 2009; Mortensen et al., 2001; Wheeler et al., 2007; Wienberg et al., 2009).\nAccording to this, one of the most decisive factors that control their location appears to be the seabed topography. Most observations of cold-water corals have been, in areas with accelerated currents, such as on sloping and irregular topography and topographic highs of various scales that form obstacles in the current path with more prolific growth occurring on exposed flanks and summits (Davies et al., 2008; Mortensen et al., 2001; Wheeler et al., 2007). Scientific expeditions have found that seamounts, outcropping hardrock, sedimentary and carbonate mounds, offshore ridges, deep-sea canyons and flanks of oceanic banks are all favourite places for Lophelia to grow (Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Rogers, 2004; Thiem et al., 2006).\n1.3.\tHabitat complexity of cold-water corals\nOnce a small coral colony has settled and the mentioned favorable environmental conditions are fulfilled over an extensive period, these organisms can form important carbonate mound structures which persist in the geological records. They produce complex, but extremely fragile three-dimensional frameworks and the colony expands, providing a multitude of microniches for a highly diverse reef-associated community (De Mol et. al., 2002; Freiwald et al., 2004; Maignien et al., 2011). Cold-water corals are thus considered as important structural components of benthic habitats, potentially enhancing local abundance in a variety of fish and invertebrate species (Braga-Henriques, 2013; Yesson et al., 2012). Deep-water coral colonies have a complex architecture, providing sheltered cavities which often contain organic rich sediments, while the outer parts provide a high water flow with little sedimentation. These biogenic structures also provide a low-disturbance environment in which the fauna is protected against physical erosion and predation. Therefore, deep-sea corals, sponges, and other habitat-forming organisms may\n7\nfunction as feeding, shelter, refuge, breeding, spawning, and/or nursery habitats for numerous species (Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004; Turley et al., 2007). Besides, recent geophysical studies have demonstrated that several species of cold-water corals are significant autogenic ecological bio-engineers able to build large reef frameworks (termed \"bioherms\") in the aphotic zone; these structures provide an important substrate and suitable habitat, forming an essential environment for growth and further development of corals and other suspension feeding organisms (Davies et al., 2008; Davies et al., 2011; De Haas, et al., 2009; Masson et al., 2003; Mienis, et al., 2009; Rogers, 2004).\nCold-water coral mounds vary in size and shape ranging from small, low relief ovoid features, to giant mounds, conical to ridge and ring-shaped features, and in some cases having very steep sides. This morphological variation is an expression of the influence of differing environmental controls (e.g. current dynamics, temperature, salinity, pH, organic particulate supply, etc.) on mound formation and growth. A typical mature cold-water coral reef structure passes through several evolutionary stages and several mound growth models have been proposed to explain their formation, growth and development (Freiwald et al., 2004; Mienis, et al., 2009; Wheeler et al., 2007). The availability of suitable hard substrate on the seabed is an essential pre-requisite for the settling of coral larvae. If the environmental conditions are suitable, coral colonies can expand themselves across areas of soft sediment either by sexual reproduction or by branch fragmentation and re-growth, until they become unstable and eventually older portions of the branches break (Reed, 2002; Roberts et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2006). Upon death of the corals, subsequent coral generations use their predecessors and other carbonate debris produced by associated benthic fauna as a substrate to settle, stimulating renewed growth and further re-colonization around the initial colony. Once the mounds reach a certain height above the surrounding seabed they influence the currents around them and a positive feedback mechanism will evolve: vertical growth of corals results in the formation of mounds with steep slopes, which in turn results in increased currents supplying additional food for the corals, enhancing coral growth and thus mound formation, which strengthen the local currents, etc. (De Haas, et al., 2009). A final mature phase may result in which the mantle of living coral is relatively negligible to the large volume of dead coral. Due to this, corals grow preferentially in elevated positions where they can take advantage of faster flowing waters delivering organic particulate food supply, and avoid the higher concentration of inorganic sediment closer to the benthic boundary layer (Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Reed, 2002).\nCoral fragments are the result of a bioerosion process that starts with the death of coral colonies due to persistent attack by boring organisms such as clionid sponges, worms, foraminiferans, fungi, bryozoans and phoronid worms to the older region of each colony. This eroded debris disintegrates due to chemical dissolution (biocorrosion) and mechanical breakup of the coral aragonite (bioabrasion) (Freiwald et al., 2004). Skeletal loss of 70-80% of the thickly calcified coral skeletons due to locally intense sponge excavation results in the weakening of the\n8\nstability and in the eventual collapse of the coral constructions onto the sediment floor (De Haas, et al., 2009; Reed, 2002; Rogers, 2004). Because of the dynamic origin of the habitat between living corals and coral rubble, it is referred to as a \u201ccoral degradation zone\u201d (Raes and Vanreusel, 2006). In a final stage of the degradation process, intensified bioerosion and less stabilizing sponge encrustation will result in accumulations of cm- to dm-sized coral debris or rubble. These rubble \u201cgraveyards\u201d not only act as sediment trap but also as micro-habitat for a wide range of organisms (Freiwald and Wilson, 1998; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Van Rooij et al., 2011).\n1.4.\tCold-water coral associated assemblages\nAccording to Freiwald et al. (2004) model, a cold-water bioherm can be divided into two major habitats: a central living coral zone on the summit and the upper flanks (Figure 3.1), overlying a lower framework zone of dead coral and sponge skeletons (e.g. Aphrocallistes beatrix) mixed with sediments (Figure 3.3). A transition of dead coral at the base of the mounds gives way to denser live coral coverage (Figure 4) progressing upwards on the mound (De Mol et. al., 2002; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Rogers, 2004).\nFigure 3. Model of a Lophelia-reef. 1) On the top of the reef the hemispherical living colonies are found. 2) Below this zone living colonies of varying size are found with dead corals in between. 3) At the base there is a zone characterised by smaller fragments of coral (rubble) mixed with sand and mud. 4) Paragorgia arborea and other gorgonians are common on the reefs. 5) Sebastes spp. are often seen in considerable numbers in connection with the reefs. The reef is about 10 m across. Modified from Freiwald et al. (2004).\nThe development of a biofilm, associated with selective Fe-Mn precipitation on the coral skeleton might enable an entirely new food web as a food source for meiofauna and higher trophic levels (macro- and megafauna), with higher diversity in the living or dead coral\n9\nframework. However, living coral is not a suitable substrate for this fauna because it responds to the settlement of sessile organisms by an increase in mucus production in areas of infestation and is able to encrust repetitively attached organisms by precipitation of selectively secreted sclerenchyme layers, resulting in the thickening of the skeleton (Freiwald and Wilson, 1998; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005).\nStudies on associated fauna of deep-sea cold-water corals have shown that their biodiversity is comparable to that of tropical coral reefs. Deep-sea corals have been shown to be associated with high abundances of rich fish and invertebrate communities (Baillon et al., 2012; Freiwald et al., 2004) (Figure 5): Lophelia pertusa is known to support over 1,300 species of associated fauna in the NE Atlantic and Oculina varicosa was found to be a feeding, spawning and shelter habitat for many commercially and recreationally important fish species, including the gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis) and scamp grouper (Mycteroperca phenax), the greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), and juvenile speckled hind (Epinephelus drummondhayi) (Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Rogers, 2004).\nThese reefs appear to offer a critical complex habitat to many species of fishes, in areas that lack defined topography. Underwater video observations of Lophelia reefs from the Sula Ridge off Norway recorded fish species such as redfish (Sebastes marinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), ling (Molva molva), tusk (Brosme brosme) and pregnant Norway redfish (Sebastes viviparus), that also were larger and more abundant around deep-sea corals. Therefore these reefs create a multitude of ecological niches, which provide firm substrata and favor the settlement and growth of many invertebrates; more than 980 invertebrate species are known to be associated with these corals, belonging to a broad range of taxa: Foraminifera, Cnidaria (hydroids, octocorals, sea anemones), Porifera (sponges), Annelida (polychaetes), Arthropoda (decapods, isopods, amphipods, cirripeds, etc.), Mollusca (bivalves, gastropods), Echinodermata (asteroids, echinoids, ophiuroids, crinoids), Bryozoa, Chordata (ascidians), Brachiopoda, Nematoda, Sipuncula and Nemertea (De Haas, et al., 2009; Freiwald et al., 2004; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Hall-Spencer et al., 2002; Reed, 2002; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004). Although most of these organisms are not found exclusively on Lophelia banks, sharply demarcated from the surrounding seabed, many of them are much less common outside of the reef and distinct from the background deep-sea fauna (Rogers, 2004).\nWhile large mobile predators and economically important organisms live amongst the coral branches, seeking protection (fish, shrimps, lobsters, and crabs), other organisms live mainly attached to dead coral framework or rubble (other corals, sponges, anemones, clams, crinoids, ophiuroids, sea urchins), so they may better filter food from the currents. Sponges and worms can live within cavities inside the dead coral branches or within the sediments around the reefs, and other animals, such as sea stars, snails, gastropods and crustaceans feed directly on the corals tissues (Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004; Rogers, 2004).\n10\nFigure 4. Impressions of the live and dead Lophelia habitat and coral rubble habitat, from reefs off northern\nNorway (from the top to the bottom, respectively). From Hermione (2012; Deliverable 4.9).\n11\nFigure 5. Examples of marine species associated to cold-water corals.

From Hermione (2012).\nThis fauna, however, is difficult to sample and not all sub-habitats in Lophelia reefs have been investigated to date; the species richness, biodiversity and ecological importance are still unknown (Hain and Corcoran, 2004). The ecological role of deep-water corals in providing habitat structure for fish and other marine life, and as centers of ecological activity, has only recently emerged as an area of academic interest as well as an issue related to the conservation and sustainable use of deep-sea fishes and related biological diversity, and demands further mapping, research and management plans (Freiwald and Roberts, 2005).\n1.5.\tVulnerability of deep-water corals\nIncreased interest in the economic exploitation of deep-water environments since the mid-1980s has raised concern about possible environmental impacts. Compared to other deepsea ecosystems, these framework-forming cold-water corals are relatively well researched, but yield several characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to a range of anthropogenic impacts. All deep-sea corals are extremely fragile due to their basic lifestyle, habit and slow growth rate; their inflexible structures are easily destroyed by almost any physical contact (Freiwald et al., 2004). As surface attached animals, they cannot escape a heavy trawl or a current loaded with sediments or pollutants and as they grow in places that have rarely been subject to sudden environmental changes, they didn't develop responses to fast-occurring changes in their environment, which gives them a great disadvantage when facing disturbances (WWF, 2004). This has led to an increasing awareness that cold-water coral ecosystems deserve full protection both within countries' Exclusive Economic Zones and on the high seas (Davies et al., 2011).\nMany studies have recently raised the concern that coral reefs around the globe are threatened: impacts of anthropogenic activities are evident in almost every survey undertaken,\n12\nregardless of the depth at which the corals occur (Freiwald et al., 2004). Assessments of these corals have shown that damage to their habitats may occur from human-induced threats such as commercial bottom trawling, oil and gas exploration and drill cuttings, dredging, sedimentation, waste disposal, dumping and pollution, bioprospecting and research activities, coral exploration and trade, and ocean acidification. Temperature extremes, excess nutrients, disease and strong currents, are also potential sources of historic mortalities (Gass and Roberts, 2006; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Turley et al., 2007).\nThe development of more powerful and sophisticated technologies has enabled industry, including the fishing and oil and gas sectors, to access ocean depths previously out of reach, leading to the overexploitation and exhaustion of fish species that inhabit deep-water coral reefs. Recent scientific studies have shown that deep-water corals are being devastated by bottom trawling, the most severe threat to these communities, which results on fragmentation of coral reef habitat and increased mortality. Underwater observations of Lophelia sp. (200-400 m) reefs off Norway have confirmed that between 30-50% of the reefs have already been removed (Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Rogers, 2004; Witherell and Coon, 2001). In addition, there is warranted concern that seawater chemistry changes caused by the increase of anthropogenic carbon dioxide levels (ocean acidification) have the potential to alter the distribution and abundance of marine calcifying organisms that use calcium carbonate crystal structures (aragonite and calcite) to build their shells, liths and skeletons (corals, plankton such as coccolithophores and foraminiferans, shelled pteropods). As the pH and carbonate ions available in seawater decrease dramatically, it will be more difficult for marine calcifying organisms to form biogenic calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and corals are expected to build weaker skeletons that become more prone to breakage and/or experience slower growth rates (Davies et al., 2008; Guinotte et al., 2006; Maier, et al., 2009).\nUnder these circumstances, the possible re-growth of damaged reefs and the restitution of their ecological function may take several hundreds or thousands of years and their removal or damage could have long-term effects on associated faunal communities (Fossa et al., 2002; Roberts and Hirshfield, 2004; Roberts et al., 2006; Rogers, 2004). Unfortunately, just as scientists have begun to understand the diversity, importance, vulnerability and role of deep-sea coral forests in the oceans, humans have developed technologies that profoundly disturb them, and so they became a topic of interest due to conservation concerns (Hain and Corcoran, 2004; Kellogg et al., 2009; WWF, 2004).\nIn this context, some countries and regional bodies have recently enacted, or are in the process of establishing, regulations and management measures to protect a few reefs including protecting discrete areas from bottom disturbing activities, restricting gear size to limit the ability of fishermen to tow their gear through rough terrain where many deep-sea corals live, and prohibiting bottom trawling in areas that have been repeatedly fished by trawls in the past decade (Freiwald et al., 2004; Witherell and Coon, 2001). However, vast deep-water resources are\n13\nprimarily found in areas beyond national boundaries and jurisdiction, in the international waters of the High Seas, where the \"freedom of the high seas\" allows exploitation of natural resources (Rogers, 2004). One of the most urgent tasks today is therefore to develop a globally agreed procedure, covered by international law, to protect biodiversity in these vast global commons (WWF, 2004).\n1.6.\tStudy context and objectives\nIt is evident that there are still large gaps in our knowledge about these ecosystems that need to be fulfilled. Scientists continue to discover, characterize, and research deep-sea coral ecosystems, and are trying to answer questions regarding their global distribution, abundance, biology, growth dynamics, carbonate production, geology, hydrography, microbiology and geochemistry, in order to fully understand the reef habitat, its structure and ecological function (Wienberg et al., 2009). It is hoped that this knowledge will be used as a basis for further understanding of how the deep-sea species survive and disperse. Without this detailed information, it is going to be difficult to determine, and subsequently manage, potential anthropogenic impacts on these deep-water reef systems. These data are also directly applicable to the conservation of deep-sea ecosystems: detailed information of the location and status of coral communities will assist in the process of determining the best management approach to conserve what remains of these systems, and to promote recovery (Freiwald and Roberts, 2005). Finally, these fragile cold-water coral reefs have great ecological and socio-economic importance, and without urgent and precautionary action for their conservation, protection and sustainable management, the goods and services these magnificent reefs may supply could be lost forever (Freiwald et al., 2004; Hain and Corcoran, 2004; WWF, 2004).\nRecently, several fossil cold-water coral carbonate mounds, almost devoid of living corals, have been found along the Spanish and Moroccan margins in the Gulf of Cadiz (GoC) in a water depth between 400 and 960 m, suggesting that these margins once provided suitable conditions for their development. Cold-water corals grew associated to these carbonate mounds (and on top of escarpments in the close vicinity of mud volcanoes (Maignien et al., 2011; Pirlet et al., 2012; Wehrmann et al., 2011; Wienberg et al., 2009). Although cold-water corals are a common feature on the adjacent cliffs, mud volcanoes and open slope, reports on cold-water coral findings in this region are scarce, and refer mostly to dead coral framework and coral rubble, even though some living colonies have been reported (Morsoleto, 2009; Van Rooij et al., 2011).\nIn this context, the development of a study project that focus the macrofaunal biodiversity of cold-water coral habitats and adjacent areas in the Gulf of Cadiz (NE Atlantic) is the focus of my research. The biological material used in this study was obtained during the cruises M2005 (64PE237), M2006 (64PE253) and M2007 (64PE268), onboard the R. V. Pelagia in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, in several sites of the Moroccan margin of the El Arraiche province\n14\n(GoC). The objective of the present work is, therefore, to characterize the composition and structure of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities that live in association with different habitats of the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz: carbonate mounds, cold-water coral reeds, the Pen Duick Escarpment; additionally, four mud volcanoes of the El Arraiche field that were sampled in the same cruises will also be examined.\nThe biological material collected during these cruises will therefore contribute to attain the following specific objectives:\ni.\tto gain more information on the biodiversity and ecology of benthic macroinvertebrates;\nii.\tto characterize and compare the diversity, abundance and the community structure of the macrofaunal assemblages from distinct features of the Gulf of Cadiz region;\niii.\tto identify differences between mound and off mound areas, namely in terms of species richness, abundance and composition of the assemblages;\niv.\tto determine the difference, in terms of biodiversity, between sites characterized by the presence of coral substrates with sites of soft sediment;\nv.\tto investigate possible differences in the macrofaunal communities according to a gradient of increasing depth.\n15\n16\n2.\tMETHODOLOGY\n2.1.\tStudy area\nThe Gulf of Cadiz (GoC) is a tectonically active area of the European continental margin that forms an E-W oriented re-entrant in the Northeast Atlantic margin, between 34\u00b0N to 37\u00b015'N and 6\u00b0W to 9\u00b045'W. It is enclosed by the Southern Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa, west of the Strait of Gibraltar (Figure 6). The GoC is presently the most extensive cold seepage area known on the European margins and for more than a decade, the international marine scientific community has deployed considerable efforts in studying the occurrence of mud volcanism and adjacent habitats (Cunha et al., 2013a; Vanreusel et al., 2009). This area is characterized by a very complex geological history intimately related to plate tectonic interaction between Southern Eurasia and North Africa, and underwent several episodes of rifting, compressional deformation and strike-slip motion during its evolution, due to the northward movement of the African plate relative to Iberia (Pinheiro et al., 2003; Van Rooij et al., 2011).\nLegend\n\u2022\tM2007_Bc\n\u2022\tM2006_Bc\n\u2022\tM2005_Bc\nFigure 6.

Bathymetry from Zitellini et al. (2009).\n17\nIn terms of oceanography, the Gulf of Cadiz is one of the most complex and interesting regions in the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic location and topography of this region locally determines the behavior of various major water masses; the present-day circulation patterns are thus characterized by strong oceanographic dynamics controlled by the exchange of NE Atlantic and Mediterranean water masses through the Strait of Gibraltar, giving rise to a particular hydrodynamic regime. This process creates two counter-flows on the GoC margin. The less saline, cooler water mass of the North Atlantic Central Water (<600 m depth) moves southeastwards into the Mediterranean, over the continental shelf, whilst the warmer, dense and more saline Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) flows from east to northwest over the continental slope (900 - 1,500 m depth). Once the MOW has left the basin, it moves north into the Atlantic Ocean. The interaction of different water masses with the seafloor at different depths is reflected in varying sea bottom current velocities and temperatures and is responsible for the distribution of highly variable seabed sediments along the margins of the GoC (De Haas et al., 2005; Hernandez-Molina et al., 2006; Lobo et al., 2000; Peliz et al., 2007).\nCold-water coral reefs in the Gulf of Cadiz have been studied previously during various cruises (e.g. TTR cruises - UNESCO \u201cTraining Through Research\" program, Moundforce cruise M2004). Although sometimes targeting mud volcanoes (MVs), during these cruises, geological, biological and geochemical studies were also carried out in order to understand the cold-water coral community structure and the formation of carbonate mounds. The El Arraiche area is part of a larger carbonate province in the southern part of the Gulf of Cadiz (Figure 7) and encompasses several mud volcanoes (e.g. Al Idrissi, Mercator; Lazarillo de Tormes, Gemini) and ridges (Vernadsky Ridge and Renard Ridge) (Rejas et al., 2006; Van Rooij et al., 2011).The mud volcanoes in this area are mildly active, as indicated by the occurrence of typical methane seep fauna, such as the siboglinid polychaetes (Siboglinum spp.) and chemosymbiotic bivalves (e.g. Solemya elairrachensis) (Pinheiro et al., 2003; Rodrigues et al., 2012; Van Rensbergen, et al., 2005).\nThe Pen Duick Escarpment (PDE) is a prominent fault scarp at 525 m depth, with about 4.5 km length and 100 m height, located in the Renard Ridge, about 30 nautical miles off shore the Moroccan coast. A cluster of about 15 carbonate mounds, in a juvenile growth stage, unlike their giant counterparts in the Porcupine Seabight, has been recently discovered in the area, covering the PDE cliff top and base. These structures are distributed in water depths of 500-600 m, reaching up to 60 m in height and about 500 m in length at the base. They are formed predominantly by fossil scleractinean coral framework embedded in a silty to muddy sedimentary matrix (Van Rooij et al., 2011; Wehrmann et al., 2011). Video imagery seabed surveys and surface samples revealed the presence of reef-forming scleractinians (stony corals) such as Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata, Dendrophylia alternata and occasionally, Dendrophyllia cornigera, however, few or no living polyps of stony corals were observed (De Haas et al., 2005; Pirlet et al, 2012). Only Anthozoans such as Chelidonisis aurantiaca, colonies of the bamboo coral Isidella elongata and other octocorals were observed living among large patches of coral rubble, i.e. very\n18\nsmall branch fragments, sparsely distributed on the soft sediments. Nevertheless, the thick open framework of these coral graveyards hosts a thriving micro-habitat for several benthic species (Morsoleto, 2009; Van Rooij et al., 2011).\nMercator\nAl Idrissi\nKidd\n'emadski Ridge|\nmoo\n-300\n-400\n-600\n-700\n-800\nCl\n\u00cd\na ra\nLdT\nPen Duick escarpment\nRenard Ridge\nAdamastor\nFigure 7. 3D morphology of the El Arraiche area at the Moroccan Atlantic margin derived from multibeam bathymetry.

The cruises were carried out within the framework of the European Science Foundation projects Moundforce (EUROMARGIN program, cruise 64PE237; De Haas et al., 2005) and MiCROSYSTEMS (EuroDIVERSITY program, 64PE253 and 64PE268; De Haas et al., 2006, 2007).\nA total of 120 subsamples of box-corer (Figure 8) were collected during the three cruises, in water depths ranging from 220 to 900 m (see ANNEXES I and II), corresponding to distinct features of the El Arraiche area: the PDE (Figure 9), top of carbonate and coral mounds and off mound areas, and additionally also in Al Idrissi, Mercator, Gemini and Lazarillo de Tormes mud volcanoes. A few samples included in this study were also collected in sites of the Moroccan margin of outside of the El Arraiche boundaries.\n19\nFigure 8.

(2006).\n20\nIn this study, the material collected at the GoC consisted predominantly of silt and clay, typical deep-sea sediments. Coral debris were found in samples taken on the top of the escarpment as well as on the flanks of the mounds and at the lower plateau adjacent to the scarp. Most boxcore samples showed a soft layer of muddy clay at the top covering the coral debris. Other substrates could also be found, such as carbonate clasts and crusts, sandy admixture and/or foraminifera admixture as well as, echinoid spines, sponge spicules and bivalve and gastropod shells. The sediment colour ranged from yellowish brown to grayish olive or olive brown (De Haas et al., 2005, 2006, 2007).\nSample processing (Figure 10) was initiated onboard immediately after recovery. The overlying water was siphoned through a 0.5 mm sieve in order to retrieve any small swimming fauna. During the 64PE237 cruise a variable volume of superficial sediment (approximately 25-30 cm) was collected and samples were considered qualitative. For the 64PE253 and 64PE268 cruises, whenever possible, one quarter of the box-corer (A= 4.9 dm2) was processed. Whenever it was not possible to take such quantitative samples, non-quantitative samples were collected instead (in addition, any sediments remaining after subsampling for various purposes were also processed separately). All the sediment was carefully washed with seawater through 2 mm, 1 mm and 0.5 mm mesh-sieves, labeled and kept in 96% ethanol.\n[Note that the author of this thesis did not participate in any of the three mentioned cruises. Onboard processing of the samples was carried out by Clara F. Rodrigues; sampling procedures were described according to De Haas et al. (2005, 2006, 2007). This study is the continuity of the works of Almeida (2009) and Casais (2012; unpublished results).]\nAt the Laboratory of Marine and Estuarine Ecology (Department of Biology, University of Aveiro), the samples were washed through a 500 pm mesh sieve and the specimens were all sorted into major taxa under a stereoscopic microscope and kept again in 96% ethanol. Specimens were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level, whenever possible to the species level. When the specimens were juveniles and/or were extremely damaged and if it was not possible to recognize whether they belong to the already identified taxa or to different ones, they were considered as \"undetermined\". Specimens were deposited in the Biological Research Collection of the University of Aveiro (Department of Biology), where they remain available for further ecologic, taxonomic, morphologic, genetic or other necessary studies. Pictures of some of the specimens collected during the 64PE268 cruise are displayed at Figure 11.\n21\nFigure 10. Sampling processing onboard the R. V.

Organisms belonging to the taxonomic groups Nematoda, Copepoda, Ostracoda and Halacaridae were not included in the analysis since they are considered meiofaunal groups (Gerlach, 1971). All sessile, modular organisms such as sponges, cnidarians and bryozoans when included in the analyses, were coded 1 (presence) or 0 (absence). Samples with less than three taxa were discarded from the multivariate analysis. The biological data were used to estimate the taxa richness of each sample and in pooled groups of samples (e.g. according to type of geological feature, type of substrate or bathymetry. Density values were calculated for the quantitative data only, and expressed as individuals per ten square decimeters (ind.10dm-2).\nAll the statistical analyses were performed using the statistic package PRIMER V.6.1.13 (Plymouth Routines In Multivariate Ecological Research) (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). Multivariate analysis is used to assess for distributional patterns in the macrofaunal assemblages of the sampled sites. The abundance data was first organized into a sample vs species matrix, and Nonmetric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (nMDS) was performed using the Bray-Curtis similarity measure, after square root transformation (Q analysis) or presence/absence transformation (QL analysis) of the data. The square root transformation has the effect of down-weighting the importance of the highly abundant species. The reduction of the data to presence/absence is necessary whenever qualitative analyses are performed. In the resulting MDS plot the placement of samples reflects the relative similarity of their biological communities (Clarke and Warwick, 2001).\nIn the context of this study, the null hypothesis (H0) states that there are no differences in the composition of macrofaunal assemblages in relation to the factors: \u201cGeological Feature\u201d (Test 1), \u201cPresence of Hard Substrate\u201d (coral or carbonate concretions; Test 2) and \u201cDepth Zone\u201d (Test 3). The R statistic obtained by this process is a useful comparative measure of the degree of separation of sites: large values (=1) are indicative of complete separation of the groups, whereas small values (=0) imply little or no segregation (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). An analysis of similarities by randomization/permutation tests (one-way ANOSIM: \"Analysis Of Similarities\") was thus performed on the MDS results of samples according to the relevant factors (Table I). The allocation of each sample to a given category of these factors is shown in ANNEX I.\n23\nTable I. Criteria used for the multivariate analysis for qualitative (QL) and quantitative (Q) data. Samples not allocated to a given category in each factor were excluded (see also Annex I).\t\t\t\t\nTest\tTotal number of samples: QL/Q\tGroup\tNumber of samples: QL/Q\tObservations\nGeological\t94/57\tPen Duick\t41/25\tBase, top and surrounding\nFeature\t\tEscarpment (PDE)\t\tareas of PDE\n(Test 1)\t\t\t\t\n\t\tMound (M)\t26/11\tFour mounds(64PE268)\n\t\tOff mound\t14/11\tFlanks of MVs; stations in\n\t\t(OM)\t\tareas without evident mound\n\t\t\t\tstructure\n\t\tMud volcano\t13/10\tCrater, outer rim and upper\n\t\t(MV)\t\tflanks of MVs\nPresence of\t73/44\tCoral at surface\t41/25\tCoral or carbonate\nHard\t\t\t\tconcretions present\n\t(without MV\t(C)\t\t\nSubstrate\t\t\t\t\n\tsamples)\t\t\t\n(Test 2)\t\t\t\t\n\t\tCoral only\t17/12\tCoral or carbonate\n\t\tbelow surface\t\tconcretions deeper in the\n\t\t(CD)\t\tsediment (downcore)\n\t\tAbsence of coral\t14/7\tWithout coral, usually\n\t\t(A)\t\themipelagic sediments\nDepth Zone\t81/47\tZone 1 (Z1)\t38/16\t&lt;560 m\n(Test 3)\t(without MV\tZone 2 (Z2)\t27/23\t640 m &lt;Z2 &lt;560 m\n\tsamples)\t\t\t\n\t\tZone 3 (Z3)\t16/8\t> 640m\n24\nDensity, taxa richness and other diversity indices were estimated for individual samples and for pooled groups of samples according to the three factors considered for ANOSIM tests. Taxa richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), Pielou's evenness index (J'), Hurlbert expected taxa richness (ES(n)) and k-dominance curves (Hurlbert, 1971; Lambshead et al. 1983; Magurran, 2004) were calculated using the community analysis PRIMER v6 software (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). While all these indices were performed in the Q analysis, only S and ES(n) values were estimated in the QL analysis.\nThe biodiversity of the different groups was also assessed by constructing rarefaction curves. Rarefaction curves typically increase steeply at first, then gradually level off (indicating that additional sampling is yielding no additional relevant biodiversity information). The more diverse the community is the steeper and more elevated is the curve. Rarefaction curves allow making biodiversity comparisons amongst assemblages based of the maximum common number of individuals of the compared samples and also allow pooling of samples into groups (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 2001; Gage &amp; Tyler, 1991; Magurran, 2004).\nFor the analysis of p-diversity, a dissimilarity matrix based on the Bray-Curtis measure after square root transformation (Q analysis) and presence/absence transformation (QL analysis) were constructed. p-diversity is herein considered as the 'extent of species replacement or biotic change along environmental gradients'. p-diversity is of uttermost importance, since its values can be used to compare the habitat diversity of different study systems, according to Wilson and Shmida (1984). Diversity partitioning was subsequently assessed for species richness (S) and Shannon-Wiener index (H', only for the Q analysis). The total diversity (y = a + p) is partitioned into the weighted average diversity within samples (a), according to the number of individuals pooled, and among samples (P), and therefore the p-diversity can be estimated by p = y - a. To extend the partition across multiple scales (p 1: within each group; p 2: between distinct groups), the smallest sample unit for level 1 are individual box core samples, while for the upper levels sampling units are formed by pooling together the appropriate groups of nested samples. The total diversity can therefore be expressed as the percentage contributions of diversity in each hierarchical level. Partitioning was carried out by weighting each sample according to its respective abundance (see Cunha et al., 2013a and references therein).\nSIMPER analysis (Similarity Percentages - species contributions) was performed excluding modular organisms for the quantitative data (after square root transformation) and for qualitative data (after presence/absence transformation) to estimate the percentage contributions of each individual taxa to the average similarity within and average dissimilarity between groups of samples defined and tested a priori (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 2001).\nThe taxa selected based on the SIMPER analyses were allocated to a trophic guild defined by the feeding mode, food type, size and source, and life style (trophic scheme adapted from MacDonald's et al., 2010) according to the criteria shown on Table II.\n25\nTable II.

Most taxa were identified to species level except for the phyla, Nemertea, Cephalorhyncha (Priapulida), Sipuncula, Echiura, and Brachiopoda. The complete list of identified taxa is given in Annex III.\nArthropoda were the richest group in terms of number of taxa (59.9% of the total number of taxa with 2,597 specimens, ascribed to 255 taxa), followed by Annelida (25.1%, 1,841 specimens, 107 taxa) and Mollusca (10.3%, 279 specimens, 44 taxa). Echinodermata are less well-represented (3.3%, 226 specimens, 14 taxa) whereas specimens from the \u201cOther taxa\u201d group account only with a total of 284 specimens in 6 taxa (Figure 12). Within the arthropods the order Amphipoda, was the richest subgroup in terms of taxa number (113), followed by Isopoda (63 taxa), while Polychaeta were mostly represented by the subclass Errantia (52 taxa) and the infraclass Canalipalpata (33 taxa). The classes Bivalvia (23 taxa) and Ophiuroidea (11 taxa) represent the richest groups of Mollusca and Echinodermata, respectively.\n12,2\n0,7\n14 2,6 1,9\n14,8\nR Other taxa\nk Other Echinodermata\ni Ophiuroidea k Other Mollusca\ni Bivalvia\n<\tGastropoda\nk Other Arthropoda\nk Amphipoda\nk Isopoda\ni Tanaidacea\ni Cumacea\n<\tDecapoda\nk Other Annelida k Errantia\ni Canalipalpata\n\u00abScolecida\nFigure 12.

Multivariate analysis\nEffect of geological feature. The MDS plot (Figure 13A) obtained for all the qualitative samples (QL) shows a large dispersion of samples from \u201cPen Duick Escarpment\u201d (PDE) and \u201cOff Mound\" (OM) groups whereas samples from \u201cMud Volcanoes\u201d (MV) and \u201cMound\u201d (M) groups show a higher segregation. The same trend was observed in the quantitative (Q) analysis (not shown). Overall, differences between geological features are supported by the ANOSIM results both for QL and Q analyses (Table III, Test 1 A and B, respectively, Global R). Results are also coherent in both analyses for pairwise comparisons with significant differences between MV and OM, OM and M, and PDE and M and non-significant differences between PDE and OM (Table III, Test 1 A and B).\nEffect of hard substrate presence. The MDS plot (Figure 13B) shows a high overlap of the different categories in this factor (QL analysis). Samples with coral at the surface (C) or coral at the sediment subsurface (CD) appear somehow closer while samples where coral is absent (A) are highly dispersed. The significance of the effect of substrate type is supported by the ANOSIM results in the QL analysis but not in the Q analysis (Table III, Test 2 A and B respectively, Global R; MDS for Q not shown). The subsequent pairwise comparisons (only QL analysis) show statistically significant differences between C and A, and CD and A, but not between C and CD (Table III, Test 2 A) suggesting a relevant effect of the presence of coral either at the surface or at the subsurface.\nEffect of depth. The MDS plot from the QL analysis (Figure 13C) shows that samples from the three depth ranges were highly dispersed. Nevertheless, both QL and Q analyses showed significant statistically differences supported by the ANOSIM results (Table III, Test 3 A and B, Global R). In the QL analysis, pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between Z1 (top of the scarp) and Z2 (scarp itself), and between Z2 and Z3 (base of the escarpment), but nonsignificant differences between Z1 and Z3 (Table III, Test 3 A). Regarding Q analysis, only Z1 vs Z2 showed significant differences (Table III, Test 3 B).\nBecause the multivariate analyses support overall significant effects of the geological structure, presence of hard substrate and depth, further analyses and results will continue to be presented separately for the different factors and their respective categories.\n28\nTransform: Presence/absence Resemblance.

From the total of 458 taxa (including modular organisms) recorded in this study 287 were found in the Pen Duick Escarpment (PDE, 52 stations), 282 in mound (M, 32 stations), 245 in mud volcanoes (MV, 18 stations) and 137 in off mound sites (OM, 15 stations). M stations yielded the highest cumulative number of Arthropoda (204 taxa, mainly Amphipoda, Isopoda and Tanaidacea) and Polychaeta (67 taxa). In contrast, the highest richness of Mollusca (23 taxa) was collected from the PDE stations. Mud volcanoes showed increased species richness of Ophiuroidea (8 taxa, mainly from Mercator and Al Idrissi MVs), Gastropoda (7 taxa from the Gemini MV) and Arthropoda (124 taxa); Gemini MV was the most taxa rich, with a total of 161 taxa (from 6 samples), followed by Lazarillo de Tormes MV (122 taxa in 8 samples) (data not shown). PDE and OM presented a similar average number of taxa per sample (14 and 15 taxa, respectively) despite the much lower sampling effort in OM. The taxa richness per sample observed in mounds and mud volcanoes was 2-fold higher (32 and 28 taxa, respectively). Again, there were important differences in the sampling effort which was much lower in MV than in M. Overall Arthropoda, and especially Amphipoda were the most speciose group but the relative contributions of the different taxonomic groups showed noticeable variations amongst the various geological features as shown in Figure 15: e.g. highest contribution of Amphipoda, Gastropoda and Ophiuroidea in MV, and of Polychaeta and Bivalvia in OM; lowest contribution of Bivalvia in M.\nPresence of hard substrate. Samples characterized by the presence of hard substrates at the sediment surface (C) yielded the highest number of taxa (327) as well as the the highest average per sample (21). Taxa richness is comparatively decreased when coral is present only at the sediment subsurface (CD: 201 taxa in total; average of 14 taxa per sample) and even more when coral is absent (A: 169; 12). Once again, the difference in sampling effort (46 stations in C, 18 in A) must be taken in account (Figure 14). The Arthropoda and the Polychaeta, were represented by 173 and 74 taxa in C and only 86 and 48 in A and while Cnidaria were represented by 16 taxa in C and there were only 6 in A. The relative composition of the assemblages shows a higher contribution of Polychaeta in A and of Bivalvia in CD (Figure 15).\nDepth. The observed cumulative number of taxa decreased from lower to higher water depths (324, 234 and 176 in Z1, Z2 and Z3, respectively).

The overall density (average number of individuals per 10 dm2) of the assemblages differed greatly amongst the different features (Figure 16). The highest number of individuals occurred in mounds (Average \u00b1 SE: 117.9 \u00b1 26.5 ind. per 10dm2) and mud volcanoes (114.5 \u00b1 26.9 ind. per 10dm2), whilst the lowest occurred at the Pen Duick Escarpment and in off mound areas (40.1 \u00b1 4.8 and 40.8 \u00b1 4.5 ind. per 10dm2, respectively) (Table IV). Density differences among the four \u201cGeological Features\u201d were statistically assessed using the Student's t-test: MV vs M and PDE vs OM comparisons were not significant (p > 0.05). For MV vs PDE (ts = 3.646; df = 34; p &lt;0.001***), MV vs OM (ts = 2.861; df = 19; p &lt;0.01**), M vs PDE (ts = 3.646; df = 36; p &lt;0.001***) and M vs OM (ts = 2.831; df = 21; p &lt;0.01**) comparisons, differences were statistically significant. The benthic assemblages were characterized by different contributions of distinct taxa (Figure 16 top, and Figure 17). Polychaeta showed the highest density estimates in M (especially Scolecida and Errantia) and MV (mainly Canalipalpata), followed by Arthropoda, which are mainly represented by Amphipoda and Nebaliacea (included in \u201cother Arthropoda\u201d) in MVs and by the high densities of Amphipoda, Isopoda and Tanaidacea in M. MVs were also characterized by the highest densities of Ophiuroidea and Gastropoda and Mounds by high numbers of Sipuncula (\u201cother taxa\u201d). OM assemblages present a higher relative contribution of Polychaeta than Arthropoda, whilst PDE shows even abundances of both taxonomic groups.\n33\nTable IV.

On average, C yielded greater average abundances (72.7 \u00b1 14.9 ind. per 10dm2) than CD (39.5 \u00b1 6.5 ind. per 10dm2) and A (32.1 \u00b1 3.7 ind. per 10dm2) (Figure 16; Table IV). However, statistical t-tests did not reveal significant differences between density averages of any pair of these groups (p > 0.05), which may be explained by the high variability among replicates. Annelids were, in general, the most abundant taxa and dominant in all assemblages, and the assemblages do not seem to show clear differentiation patterns in terms of relative contributions of the different taxa to total abundance (Figure 17).\n35\n18\t52\t30\t15\t46\t24\t18\t46\t32\t19\nH Other taxa\nlj Other Echinodermata a Ophiuroidea\nLJ Other Mollusca\na Bivalvia\nB Gastropoda\na Other Arthropoda\n!_J Amphipoda\nlj Isopoda\nlj Tanaidacea\na Cumacea\na Decapoda\n_ Other Annelida\nLI Errantia\na Canalipalpata\na Scolecida\nLJ Other Cnidaria u Anthozoa\nI Hydrozoa\nFigure 17.

Abbreviations as in Figure 14.\nDepth. Macrofaunal densities (Figure 16; Table IV) were highest at shallower depths (Z1: 88.2 \u00b1 20.8 ind. per 10dm2), decreasing greatly at the scarp (36.0 \u00b1 3.7 ind. per 10dm2), and finally increasing again at greater depths (Z3: 64.8 \u00b1 15.5 ind. per 10dm2). Statistically significant differences were only found between Z1 and Z2 densities (ts = 2.75; df = 39; p &lt;0.01**). In terms of relative abundance, Amphipoda are clearly dominant in Z1, but their numerical importance is reduced towards greater depths where Isopod and then Polychaeta increase their dominance (Figure 17). At Zone 1, Ophiuroids and Bivalves also reach their highest contributions for the total abundance of the benthic assemblage. The contribution of other taxa such as Sipuncula for Z1 and Z3 abundances is also noticeable.\n3.4.\tDiversity indices\nOverall and with very few exceptions, the studied assemblages show high diversity and low dominance (Table IV, Figure 18). The values of Shannon-Wiener diversity ranged from 3.62 to 4.37, evenness from 0.838 to 0.919, Hurlbert's number of expected taxa per 100 individuals varied from 48.2 to 56.6, and the contribution of the first dominant species from 15.1 to 43.4%.\nGeological features. Mound assemblages show the highest diversity (M: H': 4.37; ES(100): 56.6) followed closely by mud volcanoes whereas the off mound assemblages showed the lowest diversity values (H': 3.79; ES(100): 48.2) but also the highest evenness (J': 0.885) (Table IV, Q analysis). The k-dominance plots (Figure 18A) show overlapping curves of all assemblages except\n36\nfor the M assemblage that is clearly below the three other. When the whole dataset is considered,\nthe sampling effort is especially increased in\nPDE, and it is this area that yields the highest\nbiodiversity (ES(ioo): 61.5; Table IV, QL analysis).\nCumulative Dominance (%)\nFigure 18. Comparison of k-dominance curves for macrofaunal assemblages (Q analysis) pooled by Geological\nFeature (A), Presence of Hard Substrate (B) and Depth Zone (C). Abbreviations as in Figure 14.\nPresence of hard substrate. The assemblages from sites with coral framework at the sediment surface (C), presented the highest diversity values and lowest evenness (H': 4.36; ES(ioo): 55.1; J': 0.847) but the values in CD and A did not show a clear trend (Table IV, Q analysis). However, the k-dominance curves, all very close together but not overlapping, suggest that there is a gradient from the lowest dominance in C towards CD and A (Figure 18B). The QL analysis also further increased the difference in diversity between assemblages associated with C and the other two groups (Table IV, QL).\nDepth. Although the shallow area yields higher diversity, the differences between depth zones are relatively small (Table IV, Q analysis) and when the whole dataset is used (QL analysis)\n37\nthe results are not coherent as it is the deeper area yielding the highest diversity. The analysis of the k-dominance curves (Figure 18C) also shows overlapping curves confirming the lack of a clear trend in biodiversity in relation to the pre-defined depth zones.\n3.5.\tDiversity partitioning\nPatterns of a-diversity and complementarity of the various categories within each analyzed factor are illustrated by the rarefaction curves (Figure 19). The steepness of the curves, both local (individual categories) and regional (pooled samples) indicates that the sampling effort was insufficient to assess the full biodiversity of the assemblages in the sampled area. These curves confirm the higher variability in a-diversity of the assemblages from the different geological features with PDE emerging as the most biodiverse assemblage (Figure 19A). The three rarefaction curves representing assemblages from different substrate types (Figure 19B), are initially steep and overlapping; however, the C curve builds up into a more elevated position overlapping or even slightly above the curve of representing all samples (T). This indicates that C assemblages are locally highly diverse and have a much more important contribution to the regional diversity than the CD or A assemblages. In relation to depth, there is a high overlap of the curves representing assemblages from different zones (Figure 19C) which indicates that they are similar in terms of biodiversity. The more elevated curve of the whole assemblage (T - regional diversity) indicates that there is, however, some degree of complementarity among the depth sub-assemblages.\nDiversity partitioning was assessed for species richness (S) and Shannon-Wiener index (H'), as shown in Figure 20. In terms on number of species (S), the contribution of the a-diversity is globally rather low (9-15%); in the case of the assemblages pooled according to distinct Geological Features, for example (Figure 20B), the contribution of a-diversity is 11.8% corresponding to an average number of species per sample of 18 for a grand total of 253. The partitioning of diversity in terms of species richness (S) is, therefore, mostly explained by p-diversity (P1: within each group; P2: between distinct groups): the contribution of p1-diversity is lower for the factor geologic feature, increases for the factor depth and is higher for the factor substrate (increasing variability within categories) and the opposite trend is observed for p2-diversity (decreasing variability between categories). This can be partly explained by the exclusion of the MV samples from the depth and substrate type analyses. According to these results, the assemblages of depth and substrate categories are not as distinctive as the ones from geological features.\nPartitioning of diversity is more similar between GF, DZ and HS samples according to the index related to the community structure (H'), on which the abundance is taken into account (Figure 20C). In this case, a-diversity is the main contributor to the total diversity suggesting a structural integrity of the assemblages at small spatial scales (on average, about 62.9-65.2% of the total structural diversity is represented in each individual sample). This is higher than the proportion of the diversity explained by differences within and between groups (P1: 27.3-28.6%,\n38\nP2: 5.1-9.7%). This pattern is thus linked to the consistency in the community structure, irrespective of the spatial grouping of the assemblages. Here, the dominance ranking (particularly because dominance is low in the majority of the samples) is more important in explaining the partition of diversity; in this case, the diversity between categories in each analyzed factor is only residual (P2-small differences between groups of samples).\nExpected number of taxa (ES (n))\nNumber of individuals (n)\nNumber of individuals (n)\nFigure 19.

Overall, SIMPER results were determined by the high variability and heterogeneity in the composition of the assemblages: in the Q analysis, the average similarity (AS) within groups shows very low values (from 12.3% in A (type of substrate category) to a maximum of 24.2% in M (geological feature category)) and relatively high values of average dissimilarity (AD) for comparisons between groups (ranging from 80.5% (C/CD) to 88.2% (MV/OM)). This may be explained by the presence of a large number of species with low abundance and/or frequency, namely many singletons. Annelids were the main contributors (in terms of abundance and frequency of occurrence) to distinguish groups of samples. The polychaetes Levinsenia spp., Paradoneis spp., Maldanidae spp., Siboglinum spp., Glycera lapidum and Paradiopatra cf. hispanica, the tanaid Atlantapseudes nigrichela, the bivalve Abra longicallus and Sipuncula (undetermined species) were the main contributors on most analyses.\nThe most dominant/frequent taxa of the assemblages represented on SIMPER results were ascribed to a total of 14 different trophic guilds and six life style categories (Annex IV). Overall, surface deposit-feeders (SR-De) and subsurface deposit feeders (SS-De), were the most abundant and/or frequent, with 15 out of the 45 selected taxa (mainly Paraonidae, Maldanidae, Fauveliopsidae and Spionidae polychaetes, and by the Nuculidae and Semelidae bivalves; Tables IVI). Higher trophic levels were also represented with 10 species of surface and subsurface predators on meio- and macrofauna (SR-Pr-mei, SS-Pr-mei, SR-Pr-mac, SS-Pr-mac) such as Phyllodocida polychaetes, and Oedicerotidae, Phoxocephalidae and Stenothoidae amphipods). Omnivorous categories (mostly SS-Om-mic) comprised only five taxa, three of which were asellote isopods). Siboglinum spp. were the only chemosymbiotic taxa (SR-Ch) and it was mostly recorded at MVs. Taxa were also grouped according their life style totaling six categories (M-F, M-B, D-B, D-F, D-T and S-T) (Annex IV). This analysis revealed that most of these species were motile, i.e. capable of active movement. Free living and tube-dwellers were less represented (eigth taxa, mostly polychaetes from which two are sessile: Siboglinum spp. and Spiochaetopterus bergensis/typicus). Burrow dwellers comprised Paranoid polychaetes and 3 species of the Phoxocephalid amphipod Harpinia sp.\nGeological features. Differences between assemblages from distinct geological features are partly explained by taxa such as the siboglinids Siboglinum spp., which constitute major contributors for the distinction between mud volcanoes (where they attain their higher densities) and the other groups, characterized by much lower densities of these frenulate worms; the leptostracan Nebaliacea sp. and the amphipod Stenothoe cf. marina/eduardi also contribute for these differences, as they are absent (or present in much lower numbers) in the other assemblages (Tables I and IV, Annex IV). The dissimilarity between M, PDE and OM is explained mostly by\n41\ndifferences in abundance of Sipunculids, the polychaetes Siboglinum spp., Maldanidae spp., Prionospio spp. and Spiochaetopterus bergensis/typicus (higher abundance in M) the apseudomorph A. nigrichela (highest abundance in PDE), P. cf. hispanica and G. lapidum (higher abundance in OM.\nPresence of hard substrate. Sipuncula, A. nigrichela, Levinsenia spp. (most abundant in A) and the bivalve Ennucula corbuloides represent some of the taxa that contributed for the dissimilarity between the C, CD and A assemblages (Tables II and V, Annex IV).\nDepth. Some of the major contributors for the differences between Depth Zones are again: Sipuncula, P. cf hispanica, Levinsenia spp., A. nigrichela and S. bergensis/typicus (Tables III and VI, Annex IV).\n42\n4.\tDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, 426 benthic invertebrate taxa were identified from 120 box-corer subsamples from water depths ranging between 220 and 900 m; the studied environments, at bathyal depths, along the Moroccan margins in the Gulf of Cadiz encompass elevated structures such as steep fault escarpments, carbonate mounds in association with fossil cold-water coral reefs and mud volcanoes. Unlike most of the sea floor, these distinctive habitats are known to host high abundances and diversity of deep-sea fauna (Jensen and Frederiksen, 1992; Raes and Vanreusel, 2006). These samples revealed that Arthropoda was the most speciose group (255 taxa), followed by Annelida (107 taxa), Mollusca (44 taxa), Cnidaria (40 taxa) and Echinodermata (14 taxa).\nThese outcomes are comparable to the ones obtained by several authors in other geographic areas. In 1992, the results from the first extensive quantitative sampling of deep-sea assemblages realized by Grassle and Maciolek indicated a much greater diversity of species than previously thought; these authors found that thousands of species of small invertebrates living on or in the sediments of the oceanic floor coexist in a shifting mosaic of microhabitats. In the same year, Jensen and Frederiksen (1992) identified a highly diverse, rich and facultative fauna associated to dead Lophelia colonies in the Faroe shelf off Scotland, comprising a total of 298 species, mainly dominated by Polychaeta (67 sp.), Bryozoa (45 sp.), Mollusca (31 sp.), Porifera (29 types), and Crustacea (15 sp.). Since then, increasing efforts to describe the biological diversity of cold-water coral reefs were recorded. In 2001, Koslow et al. sampled a group of 14 small seamounts south of Tasmania (Australia), from 660 to 1,700 m depth, obtaining 34 dredge samples (mouth area of 0.72 m2) with a dense, diverse (242 species) and highly endemic invertebrate benthic macrofauna, dominated by suspension feeders (30 species of corals), hydroids (14 sp.), sponges, bryozoans (14 sp.), crustaceans (69 sp.), echinoderms (58 sp.), annelids (29 sp.) and molluscs (10 sp.), which lived on the dead coral aggregates of Solenosmilia variabilis. Some years later, a study carried out in the southeastern U.S by Reed et al. (2006) documented 142 taxa of benthic invertebrates associated with six L. pertusa reefs, from which about 87% were sponges and cnidarians.\nThe present study demonstrated that when pooled according to mound (M) structures or by the presence of coral substrates (C), the macrofaunal assemblages were characterized by higher values of species richness, abundances, evenness, and low dominance, demonstrated by all Shannon-Wiener, Pielou's and ES(100) indices. In the other hand, the macrofaunal assemblages of off mounds (OM) and areas of soft sediments without coral substrates (A) were represented by low values of species richness, abundance and taxa dominance and by high evenness. The distinction between M and OM features and C and A substrates was also supported by high statistical significant differences obtained from the ANOSIM tests and was clearly observed in the\n43\nrarefaction and k-dominance curves. However, a global high variability between individual samples was demonstrated by the high a-diversity (according to H' measure) and scattering pattern on the MDS plots. This can be explained by the small sampled area of the replicates (only one quarter of the box-core) which may be insufficient to characterize the faunal communities. Nevertheless, the biogenic composition of the carbonate mounds and the physical presence of coral framework on the deep-sea sediments suggest an effect of enhancement of the communities richness and abundances on a regional scale.\nThe contrasting effect between coral mound structures and off mound sediment areas without coral framework was corroborated by other authors. Studies carried out on coral carbonate mounds from the Porcupine Seabight (Irish margin, NE Atlantic) revealed that these geological features are areas of high species diversity in the deep sea and therefore of particular ecological significance, as they provide a range of habitats associated with different substrate types that support the development of diverse and distinct faunal assemblages (Hall-Spencer et al., 2009). In one of these studies, Henry and Roberts (2007) compared the macrobenthic biodiversity between on- and off-mound habitats, from a sampled area of 2.75m2, and found that mounds were three times more speciose (313 species), richer and with higher evenness and significantly greater Shannon's diversity than off-mounds (102 sp.). Overall, annelids (81 sp.), crustaceans (75 sp.), molluscs (47 sp.) and cnidarians (52 sp.) were the richest groups of these communities, as also verified in the present study.\nCold-water coral substrates are thus characterized by high habitat heterogeneity and can be further subdivided into smaller and different microhabitats. From these, dead coral fragments support the most diverse communities (macro- and megafauna), being the underlying sediment the least diverse (Jensen and Frederiksen, 1992). This can be attributed to the provision of elevated hard bottom substrates which are suitable surfaces for the settlement of a high abundance of filter/suspension feeders and sessile fauna (e.g. scleractinian corals, octocorals, sponges and other epifaunal organisms), sheltering function (low-disturbance environment) and higher habitat diversity of branched dead coral skeletons (framework) that enables the establishment of communities on and in between. The physical structure of the corals also provide habitat for a relatively unknown but biologically rich and diverse community of more mobile species such as fishes, crustaceans, mollusks, echinoderms, polychaete and sipunculan worms, among other macrofauna (Hall-Spencer et al., 2009; Henry and Roberts, 2007; Reed et al., 2006). Moreover, according to Freiwald and Roberts (2005), large biogenic structures as sediment-clogged coral framework are able to trap sedimented organic food; therefore they can be regarded as a possible hotspot of abundant food from seasonally deposited phytodetritus in a generally food-limited environment, which support enriched, diverse communities. Due to all these functions, cold-water coral reefs are considered biodiversity hotspots as they provide important niches for a highly diverse community of deep-water species (Roberts et al., 2006).\n44\nDead coral framework and associated substrates also constitute a highly diverse habitat for deep-sea meiofauna, namely nematods found in association with the sediment-clogged coral framework which are important food sources for abundant and diverse higher trophic levels of macro- and megafauna (Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Raes and Vanreusel, 2005),\nFour mud volcanoes of the El Arraiche province were also analysed in this study, as a distinct feature of the GoC seafloor. Macrofaunal assemblages from mud volcanoes were clearly differentiated from the other geological features analysed. The ANOSIM tests revealed highly significant differences further reflected by the closer arrangement of MV samples in the MDS plot and its segregation from the other groups of samples. Furthermore, MV assemblages were represented by high taxa richness (219 from the QL analysis) and densities, almost comparable to the mounds'. High values of H', J' and ES(100) were also evident. The high density values found in these samples may be partly attributed to the relatively dominant chemosymbiotic Siboglinum spp., here represented by 100 individuals (14.08 ind.10dm-2). These samples also included a high number of other polychaete taxa (60) and arthropods, namely amphipods (61 in 124 taxa), and by high abundances of the leptostracan Nebaliacea sp. and ophiuroids of the family Amphiuridae. These results are thus comparable to the ones of Cunha et al. (2013a, b), that obtained 366 species from seven mud volcanoes at 350-4,000m depth, which is among the highest reported number of species for cold seeps. Annelida (136 sp., representing 52% of the total abundance) and Arthropoda (152 sp., 33%) were the most abundant and most species-rich phyla, while Mollusca and Echinodermata were less abundant and represented by a lower number of species (56 and 12 species, respectively) (Cunha et al., 2013a).\nChemosynthetic-based communities, often dominated by frenulate siboglinids, have been found in several mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. Therefore, the presence of Siboglinum spp. is indicative of the occurrence of reducing environments, as they are typically found in anoxic sediments in cold seeps, obtaining most of their nutrition from endosymbiotic sulphur-oxidising bacteria (Cunha et al., 2011; Hil\u00e1rio and Cunha, 2008). In these mud volcanoes there is a high penetration of background fauna including a high number of peracarid crustaceans, polychaetes (namely the large-sized, mobile carnivores and omnivores Canalipalpata families Glyceridae, Polynoidae and Onuphidae), ophiuroids and buried bivalves of the families Solemyidae and Lucinidae. Solemyid bivalves such as Solemya elarraichensis (2 specimens were collected from the Gemini mud volcano, in the present study) also live in reducing sediments, with high organic-matter content, often at reduced oxygen concentrations; their nutrition is also via symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria (Rodrigues, 2009).\nDepth-related changes in the abundance, biodiversity and composition of the assemblages present in the GoC are still poorly known. However, the analysis of the macrofaunal assemblages according to the depth gradient was rather inconclusive. The ANOSIM tests only revealed significant differences between Zones 1 and 2 (top of the scarp and the scarp itself),\n45\nwhich present contrasting values of taxa richness and abundances (higher at Z1). In the other hand, Zone 3 was characterized by intermediate abundances and the lowest taxa richness. Therefore, overall significant changes on the assemblages along a depth gradient were not verified; there was instead a notorious effect of the physical structure of the PDE in the composition of the benthic assemblages.\nThe results of the present study can also be compared with those of previous studies carried out in the GoC. Morsoleto (2009) identified a total of 145 macrobenthic invertebrates from nine quantitative box-corer samples (corresponding to a total area of 0.44m2) collected in the carbonate mound provinces along the Spanish and Moroccan margins of the GoC, between 520 and 907 m depth. Arthropoda, Annelida and Cnidaria were the major taxonomic groups represented on the samples. The author found highly heterogeneous assemblages with low dominance and high diversity, which is in accordance to the current results obtained from the Pen Duick Escarpment.\nIn terms of trophic guilds of the most abundant taxa there were increased contributions of deposit feeders feeding on small particles which form part of the sediment and benthic microfauna; most of them were represented by polychaetes but also by detritivorous crustaceans, several with a more opportunistic diet (e.g. caprellid amphipods such as Liropus elongatus and apseudomorph tanaids). Apseudomorph tanaids such as Atlantapseudes nigrichela use their appendages to collect detritus from the sediment but also may use a secondary filter feeding strategy. According to Cunha et al. (2013a), high-density assemblages in the deep-sea (e.g. mud volcanos) generally support higher trophic levels such as omnivores, carnivores or scavengers (e.g. Aciculata polychaetes), well represented by relatively common species such as Glycera lapidum and Paradiopatra hispanica, which were also well represented in the present study. In addition, sampling of the fauna from Porcupine Basin carbonate mounds also revealed that although most of the animals were suspension feeders there were also deposit feeding, carnivorous or omnivorous species (Hall-Spencer et al., 2009).\n46\n4.1. Final Remarks\nMacrofaunal assemblage studies with relatively high taxonomic resolution like the present one are extremely important to the local knowledge on the faunal assemblages of the Gulf of Cadiz region but are also ultimately contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the composition and community structure of cold-water corals globally. The reduced bibliography for some groups hampered the identification of some species and highlighted the need to have more taxonomic review studies.\nThis study corroborates the hypothesis proposed by several authors, which claims that the presence of cold-water coral frameworks support a rich and highly diverse community of macrofaunal species found in several regions of the NE Atlantic (e.g. Gulf of Cadiz, Porcupine Seabight, Rockall Trough, Norwegian shelf). However, despite the increase of several studies in the Gulf of Cadiz in recent years, it is still difficult to estimate the overall biodiversity of this region. According to Cunha et al. (2013a), over 1000 taxa (unpublished data) were reported from the several locations and habitats of the GoC region (e.g. dead scleractinian cold water coral reefs, carbonate chimneys and concretions and several mud volcanoes), which exalts the importance of performing more researches in this highly rich area.\nNevertheless, the present-day destruction of scleractinean coral reefs by the increasing pressure of the industrial exploitation of the deep-sea may result in a great loss of habitat and biodiversity; the need of studying the biology, functioning and population dynamics of the benthic communities is a strong argument to improve our knowledge on the dramatic consequences of anthropogenic impacts on the deep-sea. In this context, scientific results are crucial for the development of conservation and management options in ecosystems which are affected by human activities. Future studies should thus focus these questions aiming to get more accurate estimates on the biodiversity of deep-sea coral areas.\n47\n48\nREFERENCES\nAlmeida, M. D., 2009.
