Such materials find applications in \n\nvirtually all industrial sectors, depending on the atomic ratio Si: Al, responsible \n\nfor its properties. Currently the application of large volumes of geopolymers is \n\nfocused on replacement of Portland cement. However, due to their similar \n\nproperties to ceramic materials and the search ever greater of new applications, \n\nstudies particularly on porous geopolymers has also attracted great interest \n\nfrom the academic community. But the processing routes currently used to \n\nobtain porous geopolymers are based on the routes applied in the civil \n\nconstruction for the production of aerated concrete with closed porosity, limiting \n\nits application where open porosity is required. Thus, this work had as objective \n\nthe study and application of two new processing routes (Gelcasting Route and \n\nGelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route), to create a new class of \n\nporous geopolymers with predominantly open porosity. Both techniques consist \n\nof the adoption of the direct foaming technique used for the production of \n\nceramic components, where the major difference between them is the chemical \n\nnature of the pore forming agent. For the \"Gelcasting Route\u201d commercial \n\nsurfactants were used, and for the \u201cGelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide \n\nCombined Route\u201d was explored the saponification reaction of a triglyceride in an \n\nalkaline medium for the in situ generation of surfactant. With the adoption of the \n\nsuggested routes highly porous geopolymers were produced with a \n\nhomogeneous microstructure, and open cell porosity of up to about 85vol%, \n\nwith physical properties that suggest they may be used as a low cost \n\nreplacement to highly porous ceramics in applications such as catalyst \n\nsupports, filtration of hot gases, adsorption and insulating refractory furnaces. \n\n  \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\nGEOPOL\u00cdMEROS ALTAMENTE POROSOS: EFEITO DA ROTA DE \n\nPROCESSAMENTO SOBRE AS PROPRIEDADES ALCAN\u00c7ADAS \n\n \n\nABSTRACT (PORTUGUESE) \n\n \n\nOs geopol\u00edmeros (pol\u00edmeros inorg\u00e2nicos) t\u00eam atra\u00eddo a aten\u00e7\u00e3o da academia \n\npor v\u00e1rias raz\u00f5es, em particular pelo fato de ser considerado um material \n\nsustent\u00e1vel onde subprodutos industriais podem ser utilizados como mat\u00e9ria \n\nprima, al\u00e9m de um processo de baixo custo energ\u00e9tico.

Atualmente seu grande \n\nvolume de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 na substitui\u00e7\u00e3o do cimento Portland. Entretanto, \n\ndevido \u00e0s suas propriedades similares aos materiais cer\u00e2micos e a busca cada \n\nvez maior por novas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es, estudos sobre geopol\u00edmeros porosos tem \n\ndespertado grande interesse da academia.

Neste sentido, este trabalho \n\nteve como objetivo o desenvolvimento de duas novas rotas de processamento \n\n(Gelcasting Route e Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route), para \n\na cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma nova classe de geopol\u00edmeros porosos com porosidade \n\naberta. Em ambas as rotas foram adotadas a t\u00e9cnica de espuma\u00e7\u00e3o direta para \n\na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de componentes cer\u00e2micos, sendo que a maior diferen\u00e7a entre elas \n\nest\u00e1 na natureza qu\u00edmica do agente porog\u00eanico. Na \u201cGelcasting Route\u201d foram \n\nusados surfactantes comerciais, e na \u201cGelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide \n\nCombined Route\u201d foi explorada a rea\u00e7\u00e3o de saponifica\u00e7\u00e3o de um triglicer\u00eddeo \n\nem meio alcalino para a gera\u00e7\u00e3o in situ de surfactante.

Tali materiali \n\ntrovano applicazione in tutti i settori industriali, in funzione del rapporto atomico \n\nSi: Al, responsabile delle sue propriet\u00e0. Attualmente l'applicazione di grandi \n\nvolumi \u00e8 focalizzata sulla sostituzione del cemento Portland. Intanto, a causa \n\ndelle loro propriet\u00e0 simili ai materiali ceramici e la ricerca di nuove applicazioni, \n\nstudi sui geopolimeri porosi, ha anche suscitato grande interesse da parte della \n\ncomunit\u00e0 accademica. Tuttavia, i percorsi di lavorazione attualmente utilizzate \n\nper ottenere questi materiali sono basati sulle linee utilizzate nella costruzione \n\nper la produzione di calcestruzzo poroso, con porosit\u00e0 chiusa, limitano la sua \n\napplicazione dove \u00e8 richiesta porosit\u00e0 aperta. Pertanto, questo studio hanno \n\ncome obiettivo lo sviluppo di due nuovi percorsi di elaborazione (Gelcasting \n\nRoute e Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route), per creare una \n\nnuova classe di geopolimeri porosi con porosit\u00e0 aperta. Entrambe le tecniche \n\nconsistono dell'adozione della tecnica di schiumatura diretta utilizzati per la \n\nproduzione di componenti ceramici, e la differenza principale tra di loro \u00e8 nella \n\nnatura chimica dell'agente che formano i pori. Per \"Gelcasting Route\u201d sono stati \n\nusati tensioattivi commerciali, e per \"Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide \n\nCombined Route \" \u00e8 stata esplorata la reazione di saponificazione di un \n\ntrigliceride in ambiente alcalino per la generazione in situ di tensioattivi. Con \n\nl'adozione dei percorsi sono stati prodotti i geopolimeri con una microstruttura \n\nomogenea, cellule aperte e porosit\u00e0 fino a 85vol%, con propriet\u00e0 fisiche che \n\nsuggeriscono che possono essere usati in sostituzione per ceramiche \n\naltamente porosi in applicazioni come supporti catalizzatore, filtrazione di gas \n\ncaldi, adsorbimento ed isolanti di forni refrattari. \n\n\n\nx \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nxi \n\n \n\nPUBLICATIONS \n\n \n\nCILLA, M.

INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nThe term geopolymer was created by Davidovits [1] in 1978 to define \n\na class of materials of mineral nature with chemical composition similar to that \n\nof zeolite, but with a mixed microstructure (from amorphous to semi-crystalline). \n\nThe silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) species present in the raw \n\nmaterials react in a highly alkaline medium, organizing themselves in a \n\ncontinuous three dimensional structure by sharing oxygen atoms, forming \n\nbonds such as Si-O-Al-O (sialate), Si-O-Al-O-Si-O (sialate-siloxo) or Si-O-Al-O-\n\nSi-O-Si-O (sialate-disiloxo), also called polysialates, where the term sialate is an \n\nabbreviation for silicon-aluminate. \n\nAmong the different types of geopolymers, those based on \n\npotassium activators show improved mechanical and thermal properties due to \n\nthe larger size of the potassium ion compared to sodium [2].\n \n\nThese materials have found application in virtually all fields of \n\nindustry, depending in particular on the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio, which provides, \n\namong their properties, high mechanical strength, resistance to freeze-thaw, \n\nhigh chemical inertness, including acid attack, and excellent fire resistance, \n\nbeing considered as replacement for conventional cement-based applications \n\nas well as for ceramic components that can be used up to medium-high \n\ntemperature (typically below 1200 \u00b0C) [1]. \n\nExplored applications include bricks, thermal insulation, and \n\nencapsulation of radioactive and toxic waste, foundry equipment and \n\ncomposites, as presented in Figure 1.1 [3]. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Overall framework of the applications according to the atomic ratio \n\nSi:Al [3]. \n\n \n\nIn addition, these materials can be considered sustainable, because \n\nthey reach their final properties, which could be improved to some specific \n\napplications by heat treatment, at temperatures not exceeding 100 \u00b0C during \n\nthe geopolymerization reaction, even considering the thermal energy employed \n\nfor obtaining metakaolin and silicates, thereby limiting the energy required to \n\nproduce a component.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nMoreover, geopolymers could be produced using as raw materials, \n\nindustrial waste as fly ash and furnace slag or building wastes as bricks and \n\ntiles, all of them rich in Al2O3 and SiO2 in a non-crystalline form. \n\n \n\n1.1 Generality on porous geopolymers \n\n \n\nSeveral papers describe the production of porous components based \n\non geopolymers borrowing the typical approach used in the cement industry to \n\nprocedure aerated concrete, that is the addition to an aqueous geopolymer \n\nslurry of components (such as silica fume or Al powder) capable of generating \n\nin situ gaseous H2 because of the oxidation reaction occurring with metallic Si \n\nor Al in a highly alkaline environment [2, 4]. Another approach that has been \n\nproposed is the addition of peroxides, which decompose generating gas [5]. \n\nThese approaches provide a suitable way of fabricating highly porous \n\ncomponents, but when these processing routes are used the cells are typically \n\nclosed, i.e., no interconnecting pores are present on the cell walls, thereby \n\ngreatly limiting properties such as the permeability to liquids or gases of the \n\ncomponent. Despite all these studies, little work has been devoted to the \n\nproduction of geopolymer foams in routes where open cells could be achieved. \n\nWithin this context, the objective proposed in this work was study and \n\ndevelop for the first time two alternative approaches: a Gelcasting Route (GCR), \n\nbased on the presence of appropriate surfactants applied with mechanical \n\nstirring, and also a Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide combined route, using a \n\ntriglyceride source which reacts in a basic medium to produce in situ surfactant \n\nand generate porosity with the stirring step. For both routes was possible the \n\nproduction of highly porous components from geopolymer precursors with \n\npredominantly open cells, which can extend the range of applications, including \n\nfor example, processes where permeability and adsorption are required. \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n \n\n2.1 Geopolymers \n\n \n\nA geopolymer is an inorganic binder, which is synthesized by mixing \n\nat ambient or slightly above temperatures (e.g. 90 \u00b0C) a reactive aluminosilicate \n\npowder (e.g. metakaolin, calcined clay, fly ash) with an alkaline activator that \n\ncontains alkali hydroxide, silicates, aluminates, carbonates or sulphates, or a \n\ncombination thereof (Figure 2.1). The reaction product consists mainly by an \n\namorphous aluminosilicate phase due by interlinked SiO4\n4-\n\n and AlO4\n5-\n\n \n\ntetrahedral forming a 3D-structure [6]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 Schematic diagram for geopolymer production [6]. \n\n \n\nEven the term geopolymer, created by Davidovits [1], is commonly \n\nused to describe the amorphous to crystalline reaction products from synthesis \n\nof alkali aluminosilicates due the reaction with alkali hydroxide/alkali silicate \n\nsolution [7], geopolymeric gels and composites are also usually applied to \n\ndesignate materials which are synthetized utilizing the same chemistry as: low-\n\ntemperature aluminosilicate glass [8], alkali-activated cement [9], geocement \n\n[10], alkali-bonded ceramic [11], inorganic polymer concrete [12], and \n\nhydroceramic [13]. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nGenerally, the alkali activation is a hydration reaction that comprises \n\ndissolution and precipitation of aluminosilicates (precursors) in an aqueous \n\nsolution of alkaline or alkaline earth metal, such as: \n\n \n\n? hydroxide (ROH, R(OH)2), \n\n? salts of weak acids (R2CO3, R2S, RF), \n\n? salts of strong acids salts (Na2SO4, CaSO4.2H2O), \n\n? or silicate salts of type R2(n)SiO2, \n\nwhere R is an alkaline ion such as Na, K or Li, or an alkaline earth \n\nsuch as Ca [3]. \n\n \n\nConsidering the zeolite chemistry, Davidovits [1, 3] suggests several \n\nmolar ratios and parameters that should be controlled, because they affect \n\nsubstantially the geopolymer properties like durability and mechanical strength: \n\n? Geopolymer mixture:  0.20 &lt;Na2O/SiO2 &lt;0.48  \n\n3.30 &lt;SiO2 /Al2O3 &lt;4.50  \n\n0.80 &lt;Na2O/Al2O3&lt;1.60, \n\n being possible the replacement of Na by K or Li. \n\n? Water content in the mixture: 10.00 &lt;H2O/Na2O &lt;25.00, \n\nalso respecting the workability. \n\n? Curing temperature in the range 30-90 \u00b0C; \n\n? Curing time in the range 6-96 hours. \n\n \n\nRegardless several macroscopic characteristics of geopolymers \n\nobtained from different aluminosilicate sources may appear similar, their \n\nmicrostructure and physical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties are \n\ndistinct and depending essentially on the raw material from which they are \n\nproduced [7]. The microstructure of metakaolin derived geopolymers, for \n\nexample, has been investigated by systematic variation of activator composition \n\nand its effect on the mechanical strength [14\u201316]. Also, it was observed that the \n\nmicrostructure changed from containing large pores to being more homogenous \n\nwith small pores as the Si/Al ratio was increased, which could be explained by \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nthe strong correlation with the Young\u2019s modulus and large increases in \n\nmechanical strength [14], however, any effect on the microstructure of changing \n\nthe alkali cations from Na to K was not observed [15]. \n\nIn this way, different microstructures and properties observed and \n\ncited in the literature may be explained by the conceptual geopolymer reaction \n\nproposed model presented in Figure 2.2, which shows a highly simplified \n\nreaction mechanism for the geopolymerization [6]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 Conceptual schematic model for geopolimerization reaction [6]. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 outlines the reaction mechanism that occurs during the \n\ntransformation of a solid aluminosilicate source into a synthetic alkali \n\naluminosilicate. Once in solution, the species released by dissolution are \n\nincorporated into the aqueous phase, which may already contain silicate \n\npresent in the activating solution [6]. Hence, a complex mixture of silicate, \n\naluminate and aluminosilicate species is thereby formed, and the equilibrium \n\nwithin these solutions have been intensively studied [17-19]. \n\nEven though presented linearly, these processes are largely coupled \n\nand occur concurrently, where dissolution of the solid aluminosilicate source by \n\nalkaline hydrolysis (consuming water) produces aluminate and silicate species. \n\nIt is important to note that the dissolution of solid particles at the surface \n\nresulting in the liberation of aluminate and silicate into solution has always been \n\nassumed to be the mechanism responsible for conversion of the solid particles \n\nduring geopolymerization [20]. \n\n The geopolymerization reaction of a metakaolin in Na\n+\n solution [1], is \n\ndescribed, in seven steps, as follows: \n\n \n\nStep 1: alkalination and formation of tetravalent Al in the side group \n\nsialate -Si-O-Al-(OH)3-Na\n+ \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 2: alkaline dissolution starts with the attachment of the base \n\nOH- to the silicon atom, which is thus able to extend its valence sphere to the \n\npenta-covalent state \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nStep 3: disruption of the siloxane oxygen in Si-O-Si through: transfer \n\nof the electron from Si to O, formation of intermediate silanol Si-OH and basic \n\nsiloxo Si-O- \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 4: further formation of silanol Si-OH groups and isolation of the \n\northo-sialate molecule \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 5: reaction of the basic siloxo Si-O- with the sodium cation Na\n+\n \n\nand formation of Si-O-Na terminal bond \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 6: (if waterglass* is present): condensation between di-\n\nsiloxonate and ortho-sialate molecules and creation of ortho-sialate-disiloxo \n\ncyclic structure \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nStep 7: further polycondensation into Na-poly (sialate-disiloxo) albite \n\nframework with its typical feldspar chain structure \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDespite this, the actual process of particle-to-gel conversion has \n\nnever been confirmed in the highly alkaline and poorly solvated conditions as \n\noccurs during geopolymer synthesis. Thus, without of conclusive mechanistic \n\nunderstanding of solid particle conversion will be assumed the surface \n\ndissolution, as described in the model presented in Figure 2.2 [6]. \n\n \n\n2.1.1 Precursors \n\n \n\n Aluminosilicates such as slag (obtained in blast furnaces), fly ash \n\n(obtained from the burning of coal in thermoelectric plants), volcanic ash (with \n\nnatural thermal treatment) and powder tile or stone (passing through industrial \n\nfurnaces) are potential starting materials for alkaline activation, because they \n\nhave a prior heat treatment [1]. \n\nThus, kaolin, a natural aluminosilicate, since undergone a suitable \n\nheat treatment to dehydroxylation and change of the coordination of aluminum, \n\nleads to metakaolin, which may also undergo alkaline activation. As a result of \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nthese changes, the material loses much of its crystalline structure, getting a \n\nsubstantially amorphous state of high entropy, increasing their tendency to \n\ncombine chemically [1, 3]. \n\nOne important aspect to be observed in these materials is the very \n\nlow or almost zero amount of calcium, not entering the traditional line of binders \n\nwhere calcium, as in Portland cement, has a prominent role [1, 3]. \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Activators \n\n \n\n The most common alkaline activators used to obtain geopolymeric \n\nmaterials are sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium or \n\npotassium silicates, and especially mixtures thereof [1]. \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Geopolymers to medium-high temperature applications \n\n \n\nIn several studies, it has been observed a high degree of thermal \n\nstability of geopolymers, especially in K-polisialates with melting temperature in \n\nthe range of 1400 \u00b0C [21]. However, geopolymers for application at \n\ntemperatures between 1000 and 1200 \u00b0C were also obtained with sodium \n\nactivators for applications such as thermal insulators [22]. \n\n \n\n2.2 Ceramic foams (filters) \n\n \n\nCeramic filters have been used in many industrial applications, not \n\nonly where polymeric membranes could not perform acceptably, but also where \n\nsuperior system integrity is required [23]. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nThe most commonly encountered advantages of ceramic filters, \n\nwhen compared to other membrane types used in pressure driven membrane \n\nprocesses, include the following [24, 26]: \n\n? long and reliable working lifetime \n\n? resistance to high temperatures across the entire pH range \n\n? excellent chemical stability  \n\n? corrosion and abrasion resistant \n\n? bacteria resistant and, frequently, bio inert \n\n? compatibility with highly viscous fluids \n\n? enhanced ease of cleaning and sterilization \n\n \n\n Ceramic filters are used, among the most mature filtration \n\ntechnologies, in the pressure-driven membrane processes for liquid \n\nseparations, and are generally classified into four categories, according the size \n\nof the materials which should be retained: \n\n \n\n? Nanofiltration (0.005\u20130.0005 \u00b5m) \n\n? Ultrafiltration (0.1\u20130.001 \u00b5m) \n\n? Microfiltration (0.05\u201310 \u00b5m) \n\n \n\n Regarding the materials which are made, the most common ceramic \n\nmembranes are produced of Al, Si, Ti, or Zr oxides, but also with other materials \n\nincluding non-oxides (carbides, borides, nitrides, silicides) and with \n\ncombinations thereof. \n\n Specifically for food and pharmaceutical applications, membranes \n\nmade of Al, Zr, and Ti oxides are suitable, since they meet the US Food and \n\nDrug Administration (FDA) requirements detailed in 21 Code of Federal \n\nRegulations (Good manufacturing practices) [24]. \n\n Despite the advantages presented, the higher cost of raw materials \n\nand elevate temperature sintering to produce these ceramic membranes \n\n(oxide/non-oxide based) limits their use for some industrial application. Thus, \n\nvarious researchers have reported the study of clay-based low cost ceramic \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nmembranes, using kaolin as starting material with other additives, as quartz and \n\ncalcium carbonate, for industrial applications [27-29]. \n\n \n\n2.3 Industrial applications of ceramic filters \n\n \n\n Initially, ceramic filters were developed for uranium enrichment and \n\nwere also used in wastewater treatment. Over the past years, successful \n\nsolutions and possible applications covered all industries and ceramic filters are \n\nincreasingly being used in industries such as biotechnology and \n\npharmaceutical, dairy, food and beverage, as well as chemical and \n\npetrochemical, microelectronics, metal finishing, and power generation [24]. \n\n Figure 2.3 shows the classification of porous materials by pore size \n\naccording IUPAC standard. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 Classification of porous materials by pore size according IUPAC \n\nstandard [25]. \n\n \n\n Besides the applications that are industry-specific, a number of \n\ncommon approaches are being used in different industries. Two examples are \n\noil/water separation and the recovery of cleaning chemicals [30-32]. Many \n\nexamples can be found in food industry, metal fabrication and allied industries, \n\nautomotive industry, chemical manufacturing industry, and oil refinery, including \n\npetroleum oils from tanker washers, spills, drilling, various processing steps, \n\netc. The benefits of ceramic membranes are also employed in recycling \n\ntechnology, for example, for degreasing cleaning baths, paint, coating and \n\nenamel, or petrochemicals recycling. The wastewater typically contains \n\nemulsified oils that are difficult to separate with conventional treatment \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\ntechnologies such as coalescers and oil skimmers. Furthermore, many \n\npolymeric membranes are unsuitable due to their limited stability in aggressive \n\nchemical environments such as highly contaminated oily wastewater (e.g., lube \n\noils, petroleum fractions) as previously mentioned [24]. \n\n Once geopolymers can be used to replace ceramic components in \n\nseveral applications, it is possible to extend and apply this concept to the \n\ndevelopment of a new class of inorganic (geopolymer) membrane, with the \n\nsame low cost clay-based presented earlier [29]. Also, specifically related to \n\nradioactive wastewater treatment, geopolymers behave similarly to zeolites, \n\nmaterials which are known for their abilities to adsorb toxic chemistry wastes. In \n\nthe case of geopolymers, their three dimensional framework is responsible by \n\nlocking the hazardous elements contained in the waste [3]. \n\n As the field of application for these materials varies widely, the final \n\nproperties of the filter in a particular application are also diverse. Consequently, \n\nthe search for the different routes to produce these foams such as, the replica \n\ntechnique, the sacrificial template method and the direct-foaming technique, \n\neach having its own set of properties, has attracted interest from the academic \n\nworld [33]. \n\n \n\n2.4 Processing routes t o macroporous ceramics \n\n \n\n Ceramic properties can be tailored for each specific application by \n\ncontrolling the composition and microstructure of the porous ceramic. Changes \n\nin open and closed porosity pore size distribution, and pore morphology can \n\nhave a major effect on a material\u2019s properties. All of these microstructural \n\nfeatures are in turn highly influenced by the processing route used for the \n\nproduction of the porous material. \n\n The processing routes presented here are classified into replica, \n\nsacrificial template and direct foaming methods, as schematically illustrated in \n\nFigure 2.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 Scheme of possible processing routes used for the production of \n\nmacroporous ceramics [33]. \n\n \n\n2.4.1 Replica technique \n\n \n\n The replica method is based on the impregnation of a cellular \n\nstructure with a ceramic suspension or precursor solution in order to produce a \n\nmacroporous ceramic exhibiting the same morphology as the original porous \n\nmaterial. Many synthetic and natural cellular structures can be used as \n\ntemplates to fabricate macroporous ceramics through the replica technique. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Sacrificial template method \n\n \n\n The sacrificial template technique usually consists of the preparation \n\nof a biphasic composite comprising a continuous matrix of ceramic particles or \n\nceramic precursors and a dispersed sacrificial phase that is initially \n\nhomogeneously distributed throughout the matrix and is ultimately extracted to \n\ngenerate pores within the microstructure. This method leads to porous materials \n\ndisplaying a negative replica of the original sacrificial template, as opposed to \n\nthe positive morphology obtained from the replica technique described \n\npreviously. \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Direct foaming method \n\n \n\n In direct foaming methods, porous materials are produced by \n\nincorporating air into a suspension or liquid media, which is subsequently set in \n\norder to keep the structure of air bubbles created. In most cases, the \n\nconsolidated foams are afterwards sintered at high temperatures to obtain high-\n\nstrength porous ceramics. \n\nBelonging to the direct-foaming technique, the gelcasting process is \n\nused to obtain foams with porosity levels up to 90% from ceramic suspensions. \n\nThis process consists in vigorously stirring a slurry containing water-soluble \n\norganic monomers and a surfactant [33]. The polymerization reaction occurring \n\namong the monomer molecules enables the rapid stabilization of the wet foam, \n\nfollowed by drying and sintering of the ceramic particles [33-35]. Wet foams are, \n\nin fact, thermodynamically unstable systems in which processes such as \n\ndrainage of the liquid phase and gas bubble coarsening lead to uncontrolled \n\nincrease in cell size and ultimately foam collapse by rupture of the liquid film. \n\nGas diffusion occurs between bubbles of different size and consequently \n\ndifferent concentrations of gas, due to the difference in Laplace pressure \n\nbetween them (Ostwald ripening), leading to the degradation of the foam \n\nstructure governed by the reduction of the Gibbs free energy of the system [33]. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nTo avoid this, surfactants can be used as surface-active agents for the \n\nstabilization of wet foams, because they stabilize the liquid-gas interface \n\ndecreasing the surface tension of the system. These long-chain amphiphilic \n\nmolecules adsorb at the gas bubble surface with their hydrophilic tail in contact \n\nwith the aqueous phase. The foaming ability of a surfactant is related to its \n\neffectiveness to lower the interfacial energy or the surface tension at the gas-\n\nliquid interface. Surfactants are classified, according to the nature of the \n\nhydrophilic group, as anionic, cationic, non-ionic, and amphoteric [36]. \n\nIn the case of a slurry containing geopolymer precursors, which has \n\nseveral ions in solution (K\n+\n, Al\n\n3+\n, Fe\n\n3+\n, SiO4\n\n2-\n), non-ionic surfactants have a \n\nmore pronounced effect since they possess hydrophilic groups without electric \n\ncharges. The type of surfactant can influence the cell size, size distribution and \n\ndegree of interconnection among adjacent cells (open/closed cell ratio). The wet \n\nfoam can be rapidly gelled simply by exploiting the kinetic of geopolymerization \n\nreaction itself in a temperature higher than at room temperature, with no need \n\nfor organic monomers or other stabilization/gelling additives. \n\n \n\n2.5 Saponification \n\n \n\nAs it is well known, the hydrolysis of fat or oil in alkaline medium \n\nproduces glycerol and fatty acid salts (soap) for cleaning purpose, for example, \n\nand the reaction is called saponification [37]. An example of the saponification \n\nof a triglyceride with KOH to form a mixture of potassium carboxylates (soap) \n\nand glycerol is showed in reaction 2.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n       (2.1) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nAs suggested in the equation, soap is a salt composed of a mixture \n\nof carboxylate anions, due a variety of fatty acid residues in each triglyceride \n\nmolecule, and a univalent cation provided by the alkaline medium. \n\nConcerning the saponification reaction, one important analytical \n\nchemical parameter explored here, which should be quoted, is the \n\nsaponification value (SV), that is linked to the average molecular weight of all \n\nfatty acids and represents the quantity in grams of potassium hydroxide \n\nrequired to saponify 1 g of oil [38]. \n\nAlso, in the present work, this parameter (SV) was used to determine \n\nthe amount of KOH which should be add with the oil to ensure the in situ \n\nformation of surfactant molecules by the saponification reaction. \n\n \n\n2.6 Triglycerides sources \n\n \n\n Vegetable oils and fats are mainly constituted of triglycerides that \n\nconsist of one molecule of glycerol combined with three molecules of fatty \n\nacids. These latter contain a long chain of carbon atoms, linked by single bonds \n\nand combined with hydrogen, ending with carboxyl group. Fatty acids are \n\nalmost entirely straight chain aliphatic carboxylic acids. The broadest definition \n\nincludes all chain lengths, but most natural fatty acids are C4 to C22, with C18 \n\nmost common. Besides that, fatty acids can be divided into two classes: \n\nsaturated and unsaturated. In the latter one or more couples of two adjacent \n\ncarbon atoms are linked by a double bond. If there is more than one double \n\nbond, the fatty acid is polyunsaturated, as compared to monounsaturated when \n\nthere is only one double bond [38]. \n\nBiodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid alkyl esters mostly produced from \n\nthe transesterification of fats and oils. In this process, the triglycerides contained \n\nin the oil react with an alcohol, commonly methanol, and a catalyst, usually \n\nsodium hydroxide (NaOH), to yield fatty acid methyl esters [39]. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nTaking into account how the saponification reaction was applied \n\nhere, there are some important attributes which represents a different aspect of \n\nthe produced soap [40]. \n\n? Bubbly lather: refers to the soap\u2019s ability to lather up and get \n\nbubbly. Higher values will tend to produce fluffy foam rather \n\nthan creamy foam with little or no bubbles, usually in the range \n\nfrom 14 to 46. \n\n? Creamy lather: this value indicates the stability and \n\ncreaminess of the lather. Usually, increasing bubbly will \n\ndecrease creamy and vice versa. The higher creamy numbers \n\nwill tend to produce a creamy lather with lesser amounts of \n\nbubbles or foams, usually in the range from 16 to 48. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n3 MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nThis section presents all materials used to obtain the geopolymer \n\ncomposition (precursors and activators) and also the additives applied in the \n\ntwo proposed routes (GCR and GCSPCR) in order to promote the porosity \n\n(pore agents). \n\nBasically, the pore agents used were commercial non-ionic \n\nsurfactants for the GCR and triglycerides sources for the GCSPCR which were \n\nresponsible to generate in-situ surfactant due the saponification reaction. \n\n \n\n3.1 Materials \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Gelcasting route (GCR) \n\n \n\nExperiments were carried out using as geopolymer precursors \n\nmetakaolin obtained from the calcination at 750 \u00b0C for 6 hours in a muffle of \n\nkaolin (Minasolo - Minerals and Abrasives Grains (Brazil)), metakaolin HP Ultra \n\n(Metacaolim do Brasil (Brazil)), fly ash class F (#200 mesh; Tractebel Energia \n\n(Brazil)), and as alkaline activators commercial sodium hydroxide, potassium \n\nhydroxide KOH pellets (85% purity, Din\u00e2mica Qu\u00edmica Contempor\u00e2nea Ltda \n\n(Brazil)), sodium silicate (Si/Na = 3.30, density = 1.39, viscosity = 420 cP, and \n\npotassium silicate (Si/K = 2.05, density = 1.38 g/l, viscosity = 430 cP; Una Prosil \n\n- Usina Nova Am\u00e9rica (Brazil)). Considering the high content of iron oxide \n\n(Fe2O3) present in the fly ash (10.2 wt%), a maximum addition of 30 wt% of fly \n\nash with respect to metakaolin was used, because, as quoted by Lloyd et al. [5], \n\nduring alkaline activation iron dissolves from iron-rich fly ash particles and forms \n\neither crystalline or colloidal hydrates. \n\nIn order to decrease the viscosity of the suspension, polyacrylic acid \n\n(Dolapix CE-64, Zschimmer &amp; Schwarz) was used. \n\nFor the stabilization of the wet foams, two non-ionic surfactants were \n\nadded in different amounts: Tween 80, a Polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nmonooleate - C64H124O26 (VWR BDH Prolabo) and Triton X-100, a Polyethylene \n\nglycol tert-octylphenyl ether - C14H22O(C2H4O)n ,n = 9-10 (Sigma-Aldrich). \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route (GCSPCR) \n\n \n\nFor this route, samples were produced using the same raw materials \n\ndescribed previously (GCR), up to the surfactant addition. Other components \n\nwere also used as sources of different triglycerides: sunflower oil, olive oil, \n\nbabassu oil, coconut oil, castor oil, palm stearin, bovine lard, soybean biodiesel \n\nand hydrogen peroxide (10 vol.), to contribute to the macro-pore formation. \n\nWith the aim to show the efficiency of the proposed technique, \n\nsunflower oil foams were also produced with i) the addition of oil but no \n\nhydrogen peroxide (saponification reaction) and ii) with the addition of hydrogen \n\nperoxide but no oil (peroxide reaction). To make this comparative test, hydrogen \n\nperoxide and sunflower oil were added always in the same amounts specified \n\npreviously. \n\n \n\n3.2 Methods \n\n \n\nSince the experimental development proposed here was done in \n\nthree steps as follows: \n\n? First step (Brazil): was done all initial characterization of raw \n\nmaterials and formulation of the geopolymer, presented in \n\nAppendix A; \n\n? Second step (Italy): studied and applied the gelcasting route \n\n(GCR) in order to obtain open-cell geopolymer foams; \n\n? Third step (Italy / Brazil): studied and applied the gelcasting / \n\nsaponification / peroxide combined route (GCSPCR). \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nAll methodology will be present and discussed according the two \n\nroutes studied. \n\n In the same way, always according the applied route, were evaluated \n\nsome physical properties of the geopolymer foams, without any comparative \n\nintent, but to understand and set the process parameters and respective effect \n\non the reached properties in each route. \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Gelcasting route (GCR) \n\n \n\nThe first step in the preparation the geopolymer foams was the \n\npreparation of a 15 M KOH solution, which should be used after 24 hours [41]. \n\nThen, a solution of potassium-based activators and distilled water was prepared \n\nin a mixer (500 rpm, 30 minutes, Ika-Werke Ost Basic, Staufen, Germany), \n\nfollowing the oxide molar ratios presented in Table A.5. To this solution, Dolapix \n\nCE-64 was added (0.32 wt% on the total weight). Then, MSMK and FA were \n\nadded at room temperature to the activator solution, stirring at 1000 rpm for 30 \n\nminutes, producing suspensions with a solid content ranging from 61 to 71 wt%. \n\n The geopolymer precursor suspension was placed in an oven at \n\n80\u00baC for 20 minutes to initiate the geopolymerization reaction, which is the key \n\nto enabling the retention of porous morphology of the wet foam subsequently \n\nproduced. Thereafter, the suspension was removed from the oven and stirred \n\nagain while adding dropwise one of the surfactants. \n\n Surfactant addition ranged from 2 to 4 wt% with respect to total \n\nweight, and the suspension was stirred at different mixing velocities (800, 1500 \n\nand 2000 rpm for 5 minutes) in order to generate wet foams by the entrapment \n\nand stabilization of air bubbles. \n\n Finally, the geopolymer foam was cast in a polystyrene mold, with \n\ndimensions of 4 cm of diameter and 1 cm of thickness to produce the specimen \n\nto the permeability analysis as shown Figure 3.1(a) and a parallelepiped of \n\n3 x 2 x 2 cm in Figure 3.1(b) to the mechanical strength test, and placed for 1h \n\nat 80\u00baC into an oven after sealing it into a plastic bag. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n The sample was then removed from the plastic bag and left at 80 \u00b0C \n\nfor further 4 hours. It should be noted that the samples were characterized as \n\nprepared, and were not subjected to any heat treatment at high temperature.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Porous geopolymer sample after demolding: a) permeability test; \n\nb) mechanical strength test. \n\n \n\n Figure 3.2 shows the flowchart of process used for fabricating \n\ngeopolymer foams by gelcasting. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.2 Schematic diagram for the production of geopolymer foams by \n\ngelcasting route [42]. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n Geopolymer foams were heat treated in a tube furnace (Carbolite \n\nCWF1200, Derbyshire, UK) at 700 and 1200 \u00b0C in air with heating rate of \n\n2 \u00b0C/min, dwelling time of 2 h and cooling rate of 10 \u00b0C/min, in order to assess \n\nhow the physical properties of the geopolymer foams were affected by the \n\nthermal treatment. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.1 Total and open porosity \n\n \n\n The bulk density of the geopolymer foams was computed by dividing \n\nthe mass of foam cut into a parallelepiped divided by its geometric volume \n\nmeasured, with a caliper. The total pore volume (?) was obtained based on the \n\nequation 3.1, where ?0 is the true (skeleton) density of the pore-free solid \n\nmaterial [43], measured with an helium pycnometer (Accupyc 1330, \n\nMicromeritics, Norcross, GA), and also, the open porosity was quantified by \n\n\u201cArchimedes\u201d Principle. \n\n \n\n? = 100 \u00d7  (1 ?\n?\n\n?0\n)      (3.1) \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2 Mechanical strength \n\n \n\n The compressive strength of as prepared samples was determined \n\nusing a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 1121, Canton, Massachusetts, \n\nUSA), with a constant crosshead displacement of 1 mm/min. At least 5 \n\nspecimens per type were tested. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n3.2.1.3 Permeability \n\n \n\nThe air-permeation behavior of porous geopolymers was investigated \n\nat room temperature using a laboratory-made air permeator (Figure 3.2) at the \n\nIstituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (INFN-\n\nLNL), Italy, which is based on an action-response device, making a correlation \n\nbetween the pressure drop applied across a porous medium and the resulting \n\nflow rate or velocity of the fluid output [44]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Laboratory-made air permeator used to measure the permeability \n\nof the porous geopolymers. \n\n \n\nExperiments were carried out on disk-shaped samples, which were \n\ntightly fixed with rubber rings inside the sample holder that provided a useful \n\nflow diameter of 1.99 cm with air flow, allowed to flow upward through the disk, \n\nat room temperature (20\u201324 \u00b0C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm). Pressure \n\ndrop (?P) across the disk was measured by either one of two digital \n\nmanometers (Greisinger Electronic GmbH, Regenstauf, DE, model GMH 3161-\n\n01 CE, range 0\u201325 mbar, resolution of 0.01 mbar and model GMH 3161-13 CE, \n\nrange 0\u20132000 mbar, resolution of 1 mbar) and the resulting volumetric air flow \n\nrate across the disk was measured by a laboratory made soap-bubble flow \n\nmeter with useful volume of 50 mL and resolution of 0.1 mL. At least 20 sets of \n\npressure drop and flow rate curves were acquired in steady-state conditions to \n\nensure an accurate fitting analysis.  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n3.2.1.4 Morphological analysis \n\n \n\n The morphology of the foams was investigated using an optical \n\nstereoscope (Wild Heerbrugg, Type 376788, coupled with a digital camera) and \n\na Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 200, Hillsboro, Oregon, \n\nUSA). \n\n The pore size distribution was evaluated from the acquired images \n\nusing the Axio Vision 4.8.2 LE image processing software (Carl Zeiss, \n\nOberkochen, Germany). \n\n Values obtained by image analysis were converted to 3D values \n\nusing the stereological equation (3.2), in order to determine the effective cell-\n\nsize [45] and present these data in Figures 4.8, 4.9, 4.23, 4.25, 4.27 and 4.29. \n\n \n\n??????? =\n???????\n\n0.785\n      (3.2) \n\n \n\n3.2.1.5 Specific surface area \n\n \n\n The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (SSA) was \n\ndetermined by multipoint BET method using the adsorption data in the relative \n\npressure (P/P0) range 0.05\u20130.3 obtained by a Quantachrome Nova Station A \n\n(Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, USA). \n\n All the samples were degassed at 300 \u00b0C prior to nitrogen adsorption \n\nmeasurements. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.6 Linear thermal shrinkage \n\n \n\nA dilatometer (DIL 402 PC, Netzsch, Selb, DE) was used to measure \n\nthe shrinkage of the geopolymer up to 1250 \u00b0C in air with heating rate of \n\n10 \u00b0C/min. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n3.2.1.7 TG/DTA analysis \n\n \n\nTG/DTA analysis was performed by a Simultaneous Thermal \n\nAnalyzer (STA 409, Netzsch, Selb, DE) up to 1400 \u00b0C in air with heating rate of \n\n10 \u00b0C/min. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route (GCSPCR) \n\n \n\nWhen the vegetable oil is added to the highly alkaline geopolymer \n\nsuspension (pH ~9.5), it generates in situ carboxylate surfactants (soap \n\nmolecules) through the saponification reaction, which consists of the hydrolysis \n\nof the triglycerides found in oils or fats, plus glyceride, a water soluble molecule \n\n(glycerol) which can be extracted by water after the curing process [63]. While \n\nprevious work exploited the formation and extraction of glycerol to create micro- \n\nand meso-pores increasing the specific surface area of the material, we used \n\nthe surfactant molecules (produced in situ) to generate stable wet macrocellular \n\nfoam with interconnected porosity, obtained by stirring (direct foaming, aided by \n\nthe gas generated from the decomposition of the peroxide, followed by \n\ngelcasting to set the structure). \n\nFor this route, samples were produced using the same raw materials \n\ndescribed previously (GCR), up to the surfactant addition. Thereafter, the \n\nsuspension was removed from the oven and then 25 wt% of triglyceride source \n\n(oil or fat) and respective amount of KOH solution, considering the SV, were \n\nadded, mixing at 500 rpm for 5 minutes. Then, the combined suspension was \n\nplaced in an oven at 80\u00baC for 30 minutes, being stirred again at 1500 rpm for  \n\n5 minutes, and then 6 wt% of hydrogen peroxide was added. \n\nFinally, the geopolymer foam was cast in a polystyrene mold and \n\nplaced for 1h at 80 \u00baC into an oven after sealing it into a plastic bag, and then \n\nremoved from the plastic bag and left at 80 \u00b0C for further 4 hours. \n\nThe process is illustrated in Figure 3.2. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Schematic diagram for the production of geopolymer foams by \n\nGelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route [46]. \n\n \n\nPrior to the characterization, the glycerol generated by the \n\nsaponification reaction was extracted by hot water exchanging it every 30 \n\nminutes until it remained clear, visually indicating complete extraction. This step \n\nof the extraction of glycerol can also be used to confirm the extent of the \n\ngeopolymerization reaction, since non-fully condensed geopolymer materials \n\nare sensitive to water and undergo swelling or complete destruction [3]. Also, \n\nglycerol and others organic compounds could be extract by heat treatment. \n\n To this route, the same set of physical properties evaluated in \n\ngelcasting route was performed, only changing the equipments, since this study \n\nwas completed in Brazil. \n\n Geopolymer foams were heat treated in box furnace (Lindberg / Blue \n\nM BF511732C, Asheville, USA) at 300, 600, 900 and 1200 \u00b0C in air with heating \n\nrate of 2 \u00b0C/min, dwelling time of 2 h and cooling rate of 10 \u00b0C/min, in order to \n\nassess how the physical properties were affected by the thermal treatment. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n 3.2.2.1 Total and open porosity \n\n \n\n To this route, total and open porosity were evaluated in the same \n\nmanner of the GCR. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2 Mechanical strength \n\n \n\n The compressive strength of as prepared samples was determined \n\nusing a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 5500R, Canton, Massachusetts, \n\nUSA), with a constant crosshead displacement of 1 mm/min. At least 5 \n\nspecimens per type were tested. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3 Permeability \n\n \n\nLikewise to the GCR, the air-permeation behavior was investigated at \n\nroom temperature using a laboratory-made air permeator at University of \n\nRibeir\u00e3o Preto / UNAERP (Brazil). \n\n \n\n3.2.2.4 Morphological analysis \n\n \n\n The morphology of the foams was investigated using an Olympus \n\nLEXT OLS4000 3D Laser Measuring Microscope, which was used also to \n\nevaluate the pore size distribution, and a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, \n\nFEI Quanta 200, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA). As previously mentioned, values \n\nobtained by image analysis were converted to 3D values using the stereological \n\nequation (3.2), in order to determine the effective cell-size [45]. \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n3.2.2.5 Specific surface area \n\n \n\n The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (SSA) was \n\ndetermined by multipoint BET method using a Quantachrome Nova 1000e \n\n(Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, USA). \n\n  \n\n3.2.2.6 Linear thermal shrinkage and TG/DTA analysis \n\n \n\n Considering that these characteristics are intrinsically related to the \n\nmaterials and not with the processing route, and were adopted the same \n\ngeopolymer base composition, these measures were not repeated and were \n\nconsidered results previously obtained for the GCR. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIOIN \n\n \n\n As presented in the Materials and Methods section, the achieved \n\nresults will be also presented according the used route. \n\n \n\n4.1 Gelcasting route (GCR) \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Total and open porosity \n\n \n\nWith the aim of producing components possessing a high amount of \n\ntotal porosity, first was evaluated the influence of the solid content (with real \n\ndensity of 2.192 g/cm\n3\n, measured with a helium pycnometer Accupyc 1330, \n\nMicromeritics) in the slurry, maintaining fixed all other parameters to a specific \n\nvalue, which was set according to preliminary optimization experiments \n\n(surfactant content = 2 wt%; mixing speed = 1500 rpm). \n\nIn Figure 4.1 the presented data indicate that, as expected, with \n\nincreasing the solid content in the suspension a reduction in total porosity \n\noccurred for both types of surfactant, because of the increase in viscosity in the \n\nslurries. We can observe that Triton X-100 appeared to be more effective in \n\nincorporating and maintaining a large amount of gas into the liquid, which led to \n\na larger amount of total porosity after gelling and drying. This behavior is \n\ncertainly related to the difference in the chemical structure of the two \n\nsurfactants, but further investigations are necessary to determine the accurate \n\nacting mechanism and others differences among them. \n\nEarly stability theories assumed that the foam stability was \n\ndetermined by the adsorbed surfactant which controlled the mechanical\u2013\n\ndynamical properties of the surface layer (surface tension gradients) [47]. Also, \n\nimportant parameters to be taken into consideration are the surface viscosity, \n\nsurface occupancy, gravity drainage and capillary suction. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nConsidering these aspects, Gibbs and Marangoni [47] proposed two \n\ntheories of elasticity for surfactant solutions, both dealing with the surface \n\nelasticity effect caused by different mechanisms. In this sense, surfactants with \n\ndifferent chemical structure and foaming properties can notably influence the \n\nmicrostructure of porous scaffold prepared by the direct foaming method. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Effect of solid content in the slurry on total porosity. All samples \n\nwere produced using 2 wt% of surfactant and mixing at 1500 rpm \n\nmixing speed. \n\n \n\nSince it shows a good behavior of both porosity and handling, the \n\nsolid content of the slurry was set as standard at 68 wt% to evaluate the effect \n\nof the mixing speed (800, 1500 and 2000 rpm) for two amounts of surfactant  \n\n(2 and 4 wt%).The results are reported in Figure 4.2. which shows that, again, \n\nsamples produced withTritonX-100 surfactant possessed a higher total porosity, \n\nin comparison to those produced using Tween 80. With increasing mixing \n\nspeed, the total amount of porosity decreased, and no significant difference \n\nbetween the two types of surfactant used as well as their amount was observed. \n\nThe overall change in porosity was about 8 vol% in all cases, when going from \n\n800 to 2000 rpm and both for 2 or 4 wt% of surfactant, and the decrease in \n\nporosity was particularly limited (15 vol%) when increasing mixing speed from \n\n800 to 1500 rpm. The reason for this could be ascribed to an increase of shear \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nstress in the suspension at higher rotational speed, which resulted in a lower \n\ntotal volume of entrapped air into the suspensions [48-50].  \n\nAs far as the amount of surfactant was concerned, the data indicate \n\nthat, regardless of the mixing speed used, an average increase in total porosity \n\nwas achieved when passing from 2 to 4 wt% of surfactant addition, which was \n\nof 10% for samples produced using Tween 80 and of 15% for those made using \n\nTriton X-100. Increasing the surfactant concentration favors its adsorption at the \n\ngas/liquid interface and decreases the surface tension, thereby promoting \n\nfoaming. \n\nFor a certain concentration of surfactant (Cmax), the surface tension is \n\nminimal and foaming is maximum. This concentration is close to the critical \n\nmicelle concentration (CMC), which represents the minimal surfactant quantity \n\nto reach the minimal surface tension. For higher concentrations, the surface \n\ntension remains minimal, but the addition of more surfactant will generate an \n\nincrease in the viscosity of the system, which inhibits the foaming effect [51]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 Effect of rotation speed and surfactant content in the slurry (solid \n\ncontent set at 68 wt%); a) 2 wt% surfactant; b) 4 wt% surfactant. \n\n \n\n Figure 4.3 reports the total and open porosity values for the samples \n\ninvestigated in this study, showing that, for a surfactant content of 2 wt%, an \n\nopen porosity in the range of 52 vol% for Tween 80 and of 46 vol% for Triton X-\n\n100 was generated. Similarly, for a surfactant addition of 4 wt%, the open \n\nporosity was in the range of 56 and 54 vol% for Tween 80 and Triton X-100, \n\nrespectively. These results confirm that surfactants with different chemical \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nstructure and foaming ability can influence the microstructure of porous \n\ngeopolymers fabricated by gelcasting. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 Relation between total porosity and open porosity estimated by the \n\nArchimedes Principle; surfactant content set at 2 wt% (a) and  \n\n4 wt% (b). \n\n \n\nIt is also important to observe that the processing parameters (slip \n\nrheology, foam volume, type of surfactant, idle time prior to polymerization, and \n\nother features) affect also the ratio between open and closed cells in the foams \n\n[56, 57]. Moreover, foams with different characteristics (total porosity, average \n\n  Tween  \n\n1500 rpm\n\n  Tween  \n\n2000 rpm\n\n  Triton  \n\n1500 rpm\n\n  Triton  \n\n2000 rpm\n\n40.0\n\n50.0\n\n60.0\n\n70.0\n\n80.0\n\na)\n\nTotal Porosity Open Porosity\n\n(v\no\n\nl%\n)\n\n  Tween  \n\n1500 rpm\n\n  Tween  \n\n2000 rpm\n\n  Triton   \n\n1500 rpm\n\n  Triton   \n\n2000 rpm\n\n45.0\n\n55.0\n\n65.0\n\n75.0\n\n85.0\n\nb)\n\nTotal Porosity Open Porosity\n\n(v\no\nl%\n\n)\n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\ncell size and size distribution) possess a different average strut thickness, which \n\nresults in different mechanical properties. \n\nThe heat treatment at 700 \u00b0C had no pronounced effect on the total \n\nporosity, as shown in Figure 4.4 for samples prepared using 2 wt% (a) and 4 \n\nwt% (b) of surfactant, respectively. However, increasing the heat treatment \n\ntemperature to 1200 \u00b0C led to a ~6.0 to 20.0 vol% decreases in the total \n\nporosity, depending on the type and content of surfactant. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 Total porosity as a function of the heat treatment of geopolymer \n\nfoams: (a) 2 wt% of surfactant; (b) 4 wt% of surfactant. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Mechanical strength \n\n \n\nThe correlation between compressive strength, relative density and \n\ntotal porosity of the geopolymer foams is shown in Figure 4.5. For samples \n\nproduced using 2 wt% of Tween 80 (Figure 4.5a), an increase of ~41% in the \n\ncompressive strength (from 2.35 to 3.32 MPa) was observed when the total \n\nporosity decreased ~6% (from 66 to 62%). This decrease on the total porosity \n\nwas accompanied by a ~18% increase of the relative density (from 0.75 to \n\n0.85). Also, samples produced using 2 % of Triton X-100 as a surfactant had a \n\nsimilar behavior, with similar changes in property values: ~40% increase (from \n\n1.94 to 2.72 MPa) for the compressive strength; ~10% decrease (from 69 to \n\n61%) for the total porosity, and ~26% increase (from 0.69 to 0.87) for the \n\nrelative density. \n\nThis trend was more pronounced for samples produced using 4 wt% \n\nof surfactant (see Figure 4.5b). For Tween 80, a ~84% increase (from 0.97 to \n\n1.79 MPa) for the compressive strength was observed, when the total porosity \n\ndecreased ~6% (from 72 to 68%), with an associate ~28% increase (from 0.47 \n\nto 0.60) in the relative density. For Triton X-100, a ~64% increase (from 0.45 to \n\n0.74 MPa) of the compressive strength was observed when the total porosity \n\ndecreased ~7% (from 77 to 72%), with an associate ~26% (from 0.49 to 0.62) \n\nincrease in the relative density. Such behavior can be explained considering \n\nthat the compressive strength of porous materials is depending on the amount \n\nof solid material present in each sample, represented by the relative density, \n\nand is also affected by the average pore size, with decreasing strength with \n\nincreasing pore size [60]. The highest values of compressive strength for the \n\nTween 80 surfactant could be explained by its different chemical composition \n\nand behavior, resulting in a higher densification of the struts (see later). We \n\nshould also remember that the strength of porous ceramics increases with \n\ndecreasing cell size, and therefore the effect of surfactant on cell size would \n\nalso play a role in controlling the strength of the components. Tween 80 \n\nsurfactant was shown to produce smaller cell sizes than Triton X-100, at least \n\nfor some processing conditions [61]. Regarding this feature, investigations on \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nthe strength of samples produced with 2 wt% of Tween 80 (2000 rpm) indicate \n\nan increase of ~14% in the compressive strength (from 3.32 \u00b1 0.40 to 3.97 \u00b1 \n\n0.40 MPa) and ~184% (from 3.32 \u00b1 0.40 to 9.44 \u00b1 0.30 MPa) after heat \n\ntreatment at 700 and 1200 \u00b0C respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 Correlation among compressive strength, relative density and total \n\nporosity of geopolymer foams not heat treated: (a) 2 wt% of \n\nsurfactant; (b) 4 wt% of surfactant. \n\n \n\n4.1.3 Permeability \n\n \n\nThe permeability measurement results were treated according to \n\nForchheimer\u2019s equation (4.1), which describes the flow resistance through \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nporous media for a wide range of fluid velocities [58]., and the permeability \n\ncoefficients k1 (Darcian) and k2 (non-Darcian) were evaluated according to \n\nForchheimer\u2019s equation [44, 59]:  \n\n \n\n??\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n\n?1\n?? +\n\n?\n\n?2\n??\n\n2       (4.1) \n\n \n\nwhere L is the medium thickness along flow direction, vs is the superficial \n\nvelocity, \u00b5 is the absolute viscosity, ? is the fluid density, k1 (Darcian) and k2 \n\n(non-Darcian) the permeability coefficients. \n\nAccording to the equation 4.1 the term \u00b5vs/k1 represents the viscous \n\neffects of the fluid-solid interaction, whereas the term ?v\n2\ns/k2 represents the \n\nkinetic effects [59]. Fluid loses energy by friction between the molecules of the \n\nfluid during draining; in this case, the higher the viscosity of the fluid (\u00b5), the \n\ngreater the friction will be and consequently the conversion of pressure energy \n\ninto heat. Usually, the increase in area is associated with the reduction of \n\nparticle size for granular structures or of pore size for cellular structures [59]. \n\nBesides that, any change in the processing parameters, which leads to an \n\nincrease of the interconnected porosity and pore size, or the decrease of pore \n\ntortuosity and roughness, will lead to higher values of k1 and k2 [44]. \n\n Derived from the Kozeny\u2013Carman or Ergun relationships [44], \n\nnotwithstanding the limited validity for specific porous medium properties, the \n\ntypical proportionalities between porosity P and the coefficients k1 and k2 may \n\nbe described by the following relations (4.2 and 4.3): \n\n \n\n?1 ?\n?3\n\n(1??)2\n       (4.2) \n\n \n\n \n\n?2 ?\n?3\n\n(1??)\n       (4.3) \n\n \n\nThe permeability constants of geopolymer foams produced with \n\ndifferent surfactants (type and content) and different mixing speed are \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\ncompared in Figure 4.6, as a function of open porosity. In Figure 4.6(a), for \n\nsamples produced using a surfactant addition of 2 wt%, we can observe that an \n\n8% increase in the open porosity (from 50 to 54%) led to a 2 and 3 orders of \n\nmagnitude increase in k1 and k2 values, respectively, when using Tween 80. \n\nLikewise, when using Triton X-100 as a surfactant, a ~16% increase (from 43 to \n\n50%) in the open porosity also led to an increase of 2 and 3 orders of \n\nmagnitude in k1 and k2 values. \n\nConsidering a surfactant addition of 4 wt%, Figure 4.6(b), an \n\nincrease of ~6% in the open porosity (from 54 to 57%) led to an increase of 1 \n\nand 2 orders of magnitude in k1 and k2 values, respectively, when using Tween \n\n80. Similarly, an increase of ~12% in the open porosity (from 51 to 57%) led to \n\nan increase of 1 order of magnitude for both, k1 and k2 values, when using \n\nTriton X-100 as a surfactant. This increase in the k1 and k2 values can be \n\nattributed due to the increase of the interconnected porosity (open porosity), as \n\npreviously mentioned [44]. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 Permeability constants (k1, k2) of geopolymer foams not heat \n\ntreated, produced with different surfactants (type and content) and \n\ndifferent mixing speeds, as a function of open porosity estimated \n\nby the Archimedes Principle.

Figures 4.8 \n\nand 4.9 shows the optical images, taken at low magnification, illustrating the \n\ngeneral morphology of the samples and report the cell size distribution \n\ncomputed by image analysis for each sample. Firstly, we can observe (see \n\nFigure 4.8) that when increasing the mixing speed from 1500 to 2000 rpm, the \n\naverage cell size D50 decreased by 20% (from 345 \u00b1 34 to 272 \u00b1 36 \u00b5m) for \n\nsamples produced using 2 wt% of Tween 80, and by 26% (from 463 \u00b1 80 to 338 \n\n\u00b1 53 \u00b5m) for samples produced using 2 wt% of Triton X-100. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 Effect of mixing speed on the cell size distribution of samples \n\nproduced using 2 wt% of surfactant (solid content set at 68 wt%). \n\na) Tween 80, 1500 rpm; b) Tween 80, 2000 rpm; c) Triton X-100, \n\n1500 rpm; d) Triton X-100, 2000 rpm. In the insets are shown the \n\npore size distribution for each sample. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n A similar decrease in D50 value (~25%, from 555 \u00b1 90 to 453 \u00b1 86 \u00b5m \n\nfor samples made using Tween 80 and ~ 13%, from 530 \u00b1 113 to 459 \u00b1 90 \u00b5m \n\nfor samples made using Triton X-100) occurred also for samples produced \n\nusing a surfactant amount of 4 wt% (see Figure 4.9). This effect was also \n\nobserved when producing liquid foams, and considering the stresses applied to \n\nthe slurry by the mechanical shearing processes the Taylor model can be used \n\nto explain the rheological behavior and respective cell size obtained [52-54]. \n\nThis model illustrates that, when an isolated, spherical droplet of \n\nradius R0 with a relatively low viscosity ?d is dispersed in a fluid of higher \n\nviscosity ?c, the droplets will deform into an ellipsoid or elongated cylinder. \n\nOrdinarily, the rupture of these elongated cylinders in smaller droplets is \n\nachieved when reaching the so-called Rayleigh instability, which reduces the \n\nhigh interfacial energy possessed by the elongated droplets. Deformation of the \n\ndispersed phase only takes place when the shear stress ?c? exceeds the \n\ninterfacial stress ?/R0, where ? is the shear rate and ? is the interfacial tension. \n\n The ratio between these two stresses is defined by the capillary \n\nnumber (Ca). When the capillary number overcomes a critical value Cacrit, the \n\nelongated droplet will rupture into smaller droplets of average radius R \n\naccording to equation (4.4). In this sense, Cacrit depends on the viscosity ratio \n\nbetween the dispersed and continuous phase (?d/?c) and the type  \n\nof flow [54, 55].\n \n\n \n\n? ? ??????\n?\n\n???\n       (4.4) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 Effect of mixing speed on the cell size distribution of samples \n\nproduced using 4 wt% of surfactant (solid content set at 68 wt%). \n\na) Tween 80, 1500 rpm; b) Tween 80, 2000 rpm; c) Triton X-100, \n\n1500 rpm; d) Triton X-100, 2000 rpm. In the insets are shown the \n\npore size distribution for each sample. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nThis model has also been applied for the prediction of bubble size as \n\na function of suspension composition for both, particle-stabilized emulsions and \n\nsurfactant stabilized emulsions [55]. \n\nSecondly, it is possible to observe an inverse relation between the \n\naverage cell size and the relative density, as shown by Figure 4.10 for a definite \n\nset of processing conditions. Specifically, at the same mixing speed of 1500 \n\nrpm, increasing the surfactant amount from 2 to 4 wt% increased the D50 nearly \n\nby 61% for samples produced using Tween 80, and about by 15% for samples \n\nproduced using Triton X-100, while at the same time the relative density \n\ndecreased by 20% and 28%, respectively. Also, the number of macropores \n\nincreased further and the mean pore diameter also increased, causing the \n\nmajority of pores to share pore edges and the interconnectivity to increase. \n\nThis behavior is related to the increased foam volume obtained after \n\nstirring a slurry with 4 wt% of surfactant with respect to a slurry with 2 wt% of \n\nsurfactant, processed at the same mixing speed. In this work, an increase in the \n\nvolume of the wet foam on the order of 2 and 3 times with respectively 2 wt% \n\nand 4 wt% surfactant content was observed for both surfactants, regardless of \n\nthe mixing speed. The volume of the wet foam is the first indication that the \n\ngreater the volume obtained in the foam is, the greater the average pore size \n\nbecomes [54]. \n\nAdditionally, the data indicate (Figure 4.8 and 4.9) that Tween 80 \n\nwas more effective surfactant, as in all cases its use led to smaller cell sizes, \n\nindicating the more effective reduction in surface energy of the liquid/gas \n\ninterfaces in the geopolymer foams, enabling to stabilize a large amount of \n\nbubble surfaces. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 Effect of surfactant content on the average cell size (??????? ) and \n\nits relation with the relative density of samples (solid content set at \n\n68 wt% and mixing speed at 1500 rpm). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 shows SEM images of the microstructure of geopolymer \n\nfoam not heat treated obtained from the slurry with 68 wt% solids,  \n\n2 wt% Tween 80 surfactant and stirred at 2000 rpm, where it is possible to \n\nobserve the presence of spherical and interconnected cells and dense struts.  \n\n \n\nT\nw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n 2\n\nw\nt%\n\nT\nw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n 4\n\nw\nt%\n\nT\nri\n\nto\nn\n 2\n\nw\nt%\n\nT\nri\n\nto\nn\n 4\n\nw\nt%\n\n0.40\n\n0.50\n\n0.60\n\n0.70\n\n0.80\n\n0.90\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700Relative Density Cell Size \nR\n\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n D\n\ne\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\n\ng\n/c\n\nm\n\u00b3)\n\nC\ne\nll \n\nS\niz\n\ne\n (\n\n\u00b5\nm\n\n)\n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 Morphology of geopolymer foam not heat treated obtained from \n\nslurry with 68 wt% solids, 2 wt% surfactant Tween and stirred at \n\n2000 rpm.

Samples made with 2 wt% of Tween \n\n80, stirred at 1500 rpm and cured at 80 \u00b0C, had a specific surface area of 56.89 \n\nm\n2\n/g, which decreased to 44.20 m\n\n2\n/g after heat treatment at 700 \u00b0C and to  \n\n1.27 m\n2\n/g after heat treatment at 1200 \u00b0C, with a 98% decrease in SSA value. \n\nThe decrease in specific surface area with an increase in calcination \n\ntemperature was due to the loss of micro- and meso-pores present in the \n\namorphous structure after geopolymerization, due to the transformation to a \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\ncrystalline phase with increasing temperature. Moreover, upon heating to  \n\n1200 \u00b0C, the (partial) formation of a liquid phase occurred, when the \n\ngeopolymer transformed into leucite (crystalline phase) embedded in fusible \n\nlow-molecular poly(sialate) arising from the presence of non-stoichiometric \n\ncontaminants [3]. \n\n \n\n4.1.6 Linear thermal shrinkage \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 shows the linear shrinkage, which could be divided into \n\nfour characteristic regions as function of the thermal treatment \n\nWhen temperature was lower than 100 \u00b0C (region I), the geopolymer \n\nfoam kept approximately dimensionally stable as only free water from large \n\npores and surfaces was lost in this stage. Shrinkage in region II (100\u2013300 \u00b0C), \n\nregion III (300\u2013900 \u00b0C) and stage IV (900\u20131150 \u00b0C) were caused by capillary \n\nstrain/dehydration, physical contraction during dehydroxilation/polymerization of \n\nSi\u2013OH/Al-OH groups, and viscous sintering/crystallization, respectively. On \n\nheating to 1150 \u00b0C the shrinkage was fully completed and the overall linear \n\nshrinkage value was about 10.5%. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 Linear shrinkage of geopolymer foam as a function of temperature. \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nThe effect of the thermal treatment on the open porosity of the \n\ngeopolymer foams is shown also in Figure 4.13. We can observe that the open \n\nporosity decreased more significantly (maximum loss of ~24 vol% for samples \n\nproduced using 4 wt% of surfactant) than the total porosity values, especially \n\nafter heating at high temperature. The reduction in open porosity is related to \n\nthe formation of a liquid phase which closes the spaces between the particles \n\nconstituting the microstructure of the materials, as already mentioned. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 Open porosity as a function of the heat treatment of geopolymer \n\nfoams with (a) 2 wt% of surfactant; (b) 4 wt% of surfactant. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n4.1.7 TG/DTA analysis \n\n \n\nThe TG/DTA analysis curve of the geopolymer (see Figure 4.14) \n\nshows that in the 25-300 \u00b0C range a weight loss associated with the loss of free \n\nwater/dehydration [61, 62] occurred, while dehydroxilation/condensation of Si-\n\nOH/Al-OH [61, 62] with a concurrent weight loss took place between 300 and \n\n500 \u00b0C. Also from Figure 4.14, it could be noted that in the 700-1000 \u00b0C range \n\nthe phase change from amorphous to a metastable structure accompanied by \n\ndensification occurred, and then finally, around 1180 \u00b0C, the stable crystalline \n\nphase formed, as suggested by the exothermic peak corresponding to the \n\ncrystallization of leucite (predicted phase according Figure A.4) \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 TG/DTA curve for a sample produced using surfactant Tween 80 \n\n(2 wt % \u2013 1500 rpm). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 shows the SEM micrographs of samples produced using \n\nTween 80 (2 wt% - 1500 rpm) where it could be seen the effect of the \n\ntemperature predicted and reported by the shrinkage and TG/DTA analysis, and \n\nconsistent with the experimental results shown in Figures 4.12 and 4.14. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 Effect of heat treatment on the surface morphology for a sample \n\nproduced using Tween 80 as surfactant (2 wt% \u2013 1500 rpm): (a) \n\nroom temperature; (b) 700 \u00b0C; (c) 1200 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n Furthermore, another factor also evaluated by SEM (Figure 4.16) is \n\nregarding of the different surfactants and their effects on densification of struts, \n\nalso responsible for the differences in the mechanical strength between the \n\nmaterials obtained. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16 SEM image highlighting the struts of samples produced with \n\ndifferent surfactants: (a) Tween 80; (b) Triton X-100, as prepared \n\nand dried. \n\n \n\n4.2 Gelcasting/saponification/peroxide combine route (GCSPCR) \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 shows a comparison of the morphology of foams \n\nproduced by: a) the saponification/peroxide/gelcasting combined route; b) the \n\nsaponification route (stirring, only oil, no H2O2 addition), and c) the peroxide \n\nroute (stirring, only H2O2, no oil addition). \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 SEM micrographs of geopolymer foams, as-prepared and dried, \n\nproduced using different processing approaches: \n\n(a) saponification/peroxide/gelcasting combined route; (b) \n\nsaponification route; (c) peroxide route.  \n\n \n\nIt could be noticed that the combined route (a) enabled the \n\nfabrication of foams with highly interconnected porosity and regular morphology \n\n(spherical cells), the saponification route (b) led to the formation of smaller cells, \n\nsome with openings, while when using the peroxide route (c) larger but mainly \n\nclosed cells were formed. Evidently, the in situ generation of a surfactant \n\npromoted the creation of cell windows (i.e. interconnections among cells), while \n\nthe gas generated by the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide allowed to \n\nincrease the cell size. We should note that the cell size produced by a direct \n\nfoaming process depends also on the viscosity of the slurry, which is affected \n\nby its composition. In particular, the introduction of oil and/or peroxide led to a \n\ndecrease of viscosity with respect to the slurry in which only water was present. \n\n Even within this context, and since this route is based on the in situ \n\ngeneration of a surfactant due the saponification reaction, the results presented \n\nhere could be explained by the same mechanisms described when it was \n\nevaluated the gelcasting route. Likewise that was pointed out that different \n\nsurfactants provides different properties to the geopolymer foams, due their \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nchemical structures, different sources of triglycerides also produce different \n\nsurfactants, which implies in different geopolymer foams by this route. \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Total and open porosity \n\n \n\n Figure 4.18 shows a similar range of starting total porosity but with a \n\ntiny change depending on type of oil, impacting on the porosity at the meso-\n\nscale (a) and the effect of the heat treatment in (b). Differently of which was \n\nmade for the GCR, for GCSPCR evaluation was not performed tests in samples \n\nnot heat treated due their brittleness. \n\nThis behavior could be explained by the effect of the temperature \n\npredicted and reported by the shrinkage and TG/DTA analysis, as presented \n\nand discussed in Figures 4.12 and 4.14. Besides that, Figure 4.18 (b) shows \n\nthat even present a similar range of starting total porosity the effect of heat \n\ntreatment is different among the triglyceride source, represented by the distinct \n\ngap between each temperature. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 Effect of the type of triglyceride and temperature on the total \n\nporosity of the geopolymer foams. a) real values of the total \n\nporosity according the heat treatment of 300, 600, 900 and \n\n1200 \u00b0C and b) decrement values of the open porosity of each \n\ntriglyceride source due the heat treatment in the same \n\ntemperatures. \n\n \n\n Figure 4.19 shows the effect of the triglyceride source and the \n\ntemperature on the open porosity. \n\n Here, it is important to note that the open porosity values at 600 \u00b0C, \n\nexcepted for soybean biodiesel, are higher than at 300 \u00b0C, which means that \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n300 \u00b0C is a too low temperature to remove all organic compounds produced by \n\nthis route. \n\n Afresh, Figure 4.19 (b) shows the effect of the heat treatment on the \n\nopen porosity where, as well on the total porosity, displays a different \n\nperformance mainly at 900 and 1200 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 Effect of the type of triglyceride and temperature on the open \n\nporosity of the geopolymer foams. a) real values of the open \n\nporosity according the heat treatment of 300, 600, 900 and  \n\n1200 \u00b0C and b) decrement values of the open porosity of each \n\ntriglyceride source due the heat treatment in the same \n\ntemperatures. \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Mechanical strength \n\n \n\n Regarding this feature, as shows Figure 4.20, could not be observed \n\na major effect of the different chemical nature of surfactants, specifically at 300 \n\nand 600 \u00b0C, which could be explained directly by the high value of total and \n\nopen porosity of all samples, that has a more pronounced and significant effect \n\nthan the type of triglyceride source itself (the type affect indirectly because it \n\ngenerates different porosities as seen in Figure 4.17)). The effect of the porosity \n\non the strength is more evident at 1200 \u00b0C, where the sintering (densification), \n\nwith consequent decrease of the total and open porosity, becomes responsible \n\nby the rise of this property. \n\n For instance it could be noted that, for a heat treatment from 300 to \n\n1200 \u00b0C, an increase in ~ 80% for the sunflower oil (lowest) and ~ 900% for the \n\nsoybean biodiesel (highest). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 Effect of the type of triglyceride and heat treatment on the \n\nmechanical strength of the geopolymer foams. \n\n \n\n Besides that, another point which deserves some comments is the \n\nfact that the mechanical strength of soybean biodiesel is highest at 1200 \u00b0C, \n\neven the total porosity is of equal value at 300 \u00b0C. This behavior could be \n\nSoybean \n\nbiodiesel\n\nOlive oil Castor oil   Palm \n\nstearin\n\nCoconut oil Bovine lard Sunflower   \n\n     oil    \n\nBabassu    \n\n    oil\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n300\n\n600\n\n900\n\n1200\n\nM\ne\n\nc\nh\na\n\nn\nic\n\na\nl \nS\n\ntr\ne\n\nn\ng\n\nth\n (\n\nM\nP\n\na\n)\n\n(\u00baC)\n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nexplained by their largest cell size, which, due the effect of temperature \n\nincreases the mechanical strength through the densification. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Permeability \n\n \n\n Concerning the air permeation behavior, the values of the \n\npermeability coefficients k1 (Darcian) and k2 (non-Darcian), in Forchheimer\u2019s \n\nequation [35], fit well in a comprehensive permeability map, provided by \n\nInnocentini et al. [35], describing the behavior of porous components for \n\nfiltration or adsorption applications (Figure 4.21). Foams from the peroxide route \n\nwere the least permeable, behaving similarly to refractory bricks or porous \n\nceramics produced using sacrificial fillers [46], foams from the saponification \n\nand gelcasting route had permeation typical for fibrous or granular filters [46] \n\nand foams from the combined route almost as permeable as foams produced \n\nfrom the replica technique [46]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.21 Location of k1 and k2 data for geopolymer foams obtained by \n\nGCSPCR in a comprehensive permeability map [44]. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the saponification reaction reduced \n\nthe pH of the geopolymer foam in contact with water. To obtain pH values of \n\nsamples, geopolymers were ground and dispersed in distilled water (30 mg of \n\ngrounded material into 150 ml of distilled water). In fact, pH measurements after \n\nextraction of glycerol in contact with distilled water for 12h resulted in a value of \n\n~8.0, which is much lower than the one obtained for a conventional geopolymer \n\nfoam sample ~ 11.5), suggesting that, the repeated immersion in hot water to \n\nremove the glycol might have preferentially removed relatively water-soluble \n\nmaterial when compared to the effect seen in a conventional geopolymer not \n\nsubmitted at this procedure. \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Morphological analysis \n\n \n\n As predicted by the literature [40], and considering the type of lather \n\nformed (creamy, bubbly) and viscosity, this feature shows a strong influence of \n\nthe triglyceride source. \n\n Regarding this, Figure 4.22 shows pictures obtained by the different \n\ntriglyceride sources and heat treated at 300 \u00b0C, where could be seen the effect \n\nof this parameter for bovine lard and palm stearin, those with the highest \n\n\"creamy value\" between the used sources (respectively 50 and 65), which \n\nimplies in small cells and a narrow average cell size (Figure 4.23). Moreover, \n\nthese two types of fat are solid at room temperature, which even firstly to add to \n\nthe geopolymer slurry had melted in hot water (around 40 \u00b0C) to become liquid, \n\nbegin to solidify again during mixing, which reduces the effect of hydrogen \n\nperoxide. \n\n On the other hand, sources with the highest \u201cbubbly value\u201d, as \n\ncoconut and castor oil, with values of 67 and 90 respectively, and even soybean \n\nbiodiesel due its low viscosity, provides a large average cell size. It is \n\nnoteworthy that for soybean biodiesel, a larger average cell size is favored by \n\nits low viscosity, which has as a consequence a more effectiveness of hydrogen \n\nperoxide in promote this increase in the cells size. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22 Effect of the type of triglyceride on the morphology (macro-pore \n\narchitecture) of the geopolymer foams heat treated at 300 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.23 Cumulative cell l size distribution of geopolymer foams according \n\ntriglyceride source after heat treatment at 300 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n abassu oil Castor oil Coconut oil \n\n ovine lard Olive oil Palm stearin \n\nSoybean biodiesel \n\nSunflower oil \n\n300\u00b0C \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n Similarly, these data are respectively shown in Figure 4.24 and \n\nFigure 4.25 for the geopolymer foams after heat treatment at 600 \u00b0C. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 Effect of the type of triglyceride on the morphology (macro-pore \n\narchitecture) of the geopolymer foams heat treated at 600 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.25 Cumulative cell size distribution of geopolymer foams according \n\ntriglyceride source after heat treatment at 600 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n abassu oil Castor oil Coconut oil Soybean biodiesel \n\n ovine lard Olive oil Palm stearin Sunflower oil \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n Once again, these data are respectively showed in Figure 4.26 and \n\nFigure 4.27 for the heat treatment at 900 \u00b0C.

It\u2019s important to mention that specifically \n\nregarding this property, neither the features \u201cbubbly\u201d nor \u201ccream\u201d have a direct \n\neffect on the reached values for each triglyceride source. At this point it is worth \n\nnoting that a possible explanation for this difference could be related to the \n\namount of glycerol, among other organic soluble components, generated for \n\neach triglyceride source during the saponification reaction, which was \n\nsubsequently extracted, leaving voids. However, one contrary point to this \n\nhypothesis is the soybean biodiesel, which during saponification does not \n\ngenerate glycerol, meanwhile appears as one of the sources which generated a \n\nporous geopolymer which presents the second highest initial specific surface \n\narea (59.7 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n). \n\n Besides that, seeing Figure 4.30(b), is possible to see that up to  \n\n900 \u00b0C, castor oil, sunflower oil and soybean biodiesel are be able to retains the \n\nspecific surface area in ~16 m\n2\n.g-1, the highest values at this temperature, but \n\nthere was not found a chemical characteristic in these triglyceride sources to \n\nexplain this behavior. Also, taking account the chemical character of each oil, \n\nproperties of \u201cbubbly\u201d and \u201ccream\u201d seem to not interfere directly on the develop \n\nof the specific surface area. \n\n Already at 1200 \u00b0C the effect of sintering is preponderant in reducing \n\nthe specific surface area, and practically there is no more adsorption, which is \n\nconfirmed by the results. \n\n \n\n4.2.6 Linear thermal shrinkage and TG/DTA analysis \n\n \n\nAs previously mentioned, for this processing route were considered \n\nthe results obtained for gelcasting route. \n\n  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n5 CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n Considering firstly the GCR was established that is possible to \n\nproduce geopolymer using the geopolymerization reaction to stabilize the gas \n\nbubbles introduced in the liquid slurry by rotational mixing. Also, it was shown \n\nthat the processing parameters affect the characteristics of the foams. In \n\nparticular, with increasing mixing speed the average cell size and relative \n\ndensity decreased, while with increasing the amount of surfactant the average \n\ncell size and total porosity increased. The type of non-ionic surfactant affected \n\nthe overall morphology of the foams (e.g.: total porosity and open porosity, and \n\naverage cell size) reflecting directly in some physical properties such as \n\nmechanical strength and permeability. \n\n The relation between some physical properties of geopolymer foams \n\nproduced by gelcasting and their dependence of the processing parameters \n\nwere confirmed. Concerning the permeation behavior, an increase of 1 to 3 \n\norders of magnitude of Darcian (k1) and non-Darcian (k2) coefficients as a result \n\nof the increase of open porosity with increasing amount of surfactant was \n\nobserved. The compressive strength was inversely proportional to the total \n\nporosity. The addition of a higher amount of surfactant decreased the relative \n\ndensity of the foams and their strength. No statistically significant difference was \n\nobserved for the addition of the two different surfactants for the permeability or \n\nthe mechanical strength values. \n\n By using this approach, it was possible to produce foams with a total \n\npore volume as high as ~80 vol.%, with an amount of open porosity as high as \n\n~60 vol.%. \n\n Furthermore, another new approach (GCSPCR) for the production of \n\nhighly porous, open cell geopolymer foams with relatively high specific surface \n\narea (~ 65 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n) was developed. Due the saponification reaction, the in situ \n\nformation of surfactant molecule is able to create more cell windows, increasing \n\nthe permeability in comparison to a simple and commonly peroxide route. By \n\nthis route it was possible to produce foams with a total pore volume as high as \n\n~88 vol.%, with an amount of open porosity as high as ~80 vol.%. \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n The variation of the source of triglycerides (type of oil) has a direct \n\ninfluence on some physical properties of porous geopolymers, expanding the \n\npotential application in several new fields, including filtration and adsorption \n\napplications. However, it was not possible to observe any influence of this \n\nvariation on the permeation behavior. \n\n For both routes, the heat treatment decreased the total porosity and \n\nthe specific surface area, especially at the highest temperature (~1200 \u00b0C), \n\nbecause of the shrinkage, crystallization and (partial) viscous flow occurring in \n\nthe geopolymer material. \n\nAll results, especially for the pH analysis to the GCSPCR indicate \n\nthat these geopolymer foams with hierarchical porosity could be employed in \n\nwater filtration applications for human consumption. \n\n These results, as well as the advantage of using a sustainable and \n\nlow cost manufacturing process, encourages additional efforts to optimize the \n\nuse of gelcasting and the gelcasting/saponification/peroxide combined route to \n\nproduce open cell geopolymer foams. \n\n  \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n6 SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORKS \n\n \n\n To the Gelcasting Route evaluate the influence of different \n\nsurfactants and the amount of them, and also the effect of curing process (time \n\nand temperature) and heat treatment on the physical properties of geopolymer \n\nfoams. \n\n To the Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route, explore \n\ndifferent additions and different triglycerides sources; evaluate the effect of heat \n\ntreatment and the possible addition of a third component, such as a pore \n\nforming agent and fibers, to increase the mechanical strength. \n\n Preliminary study of pore forming agent addition showed an increase \n\nof 35% of the specific surface area, in some cases for values of 85 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n. \n\n  \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n7 REFERENCES \n\n \n\n[1] DAVIDOVITS, J.

Then, a solution of the \n\nactivators, comprising the hydroxide solution and respective silicate \n\n(NAOH/sodium silicate; KOH/potassium silicate) were prepared in a mechanical \n\nstirrer (500 rpm, 30 minutes). Then, metakaolin and fly ash were then added \n\nrespectively in this sequence at room temperature to the activator solution, \n\nstirring at 1000 rpm for 30 minutes after each addition. \n\nThereafter, the geopolymer was cast in polystyrene to form the \n\nsamples to the mechanical strength test and in a cone-shaped paper mold to \n\nform the samples to the thermal stability test. Then, all molds were placed in an \n\noven for 60 minutes at 80 \u00baC after sealing it into a plastic bag. The samples \n\nwere then removed from the plastic bag and left at 80 \u00b0C for further 4 hours, \n\nbeing placed at room temperature for 96 hours, up to perform the tests. \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nMechanical Strength \n\n \n\n The compressive strength of the as prepared samples was \n\ndetermined using a universal testing machine Hounsfield (8746, England). At \n\nleast 5 specimens per composition were tested. \n\nResults are reported in Figure A.6, where it could be noticed, as \n\nquoted by Davidovits [1, 3], the amorphous character of the precursors has a \n\nsignificant role in this feature, increasing their tendency to combine chemically \n\nin the presence of an alkaline solution, thereby conferring better results to \n\nMSMK compositions when compared with those made with HPMK. \n\n \n\nFigure A.6 Effect of the type and amount of metakaolin (MSMK and HPMK) \n\nand type of alkali based solution. \n\n \n\nThis information could be confirmed when compared the amorphous \n\ncharacter of HPMK (Figure A.1) and MSMK (Figure A.2) by the diffractograms \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nThermal stability \n\n \n\n Samples (cones) were heat treated in a Lindberg Blue CF56724C \n\nfurnace, whereas similar firing curves: heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min., landing time of \n\n5 min. and cooling rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. for an empirical evaluation of the thermal \n\nstability and how this property could be affected by different precursors and \n\nactivators. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure A.7 Effect of temperature in different geopolymer composition \n\nactivated with Na based solution. \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A.8 Effect of temperature in different geopolymer composition \n\nactivated with K based solution."}]}}}
