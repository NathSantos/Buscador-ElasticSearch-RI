Electrical batteries are devices in which chemical energy is stored and converted to electrical energy on demand through electrochemical reactions. They are composed by cells, which have three main parts: cathode, anode and electrolyte. In Li-ion batteries, lithium ions move from the anode through the electrolyte and reach the cathode during discharge and move back when charging. The materials chosen in the project were lithium iron phosphate for cathode due to its specifications and potential as an environmentally friendly material and graphite for anode because it is a widely studied and predictable material. A cost analysis for implementing the plant was made and it would cost MU$ 46,76 to build the plant and purchase the equipment (grass root plant cost). The annual operational cost would be MU$ 13,21. Battery's market price is settled in U$ 650,00 per set and the payoff time of the investment cost is 5 years.\nKey words: Li-ion battery; Sustainability; Plant Design; LiFePO4\nRESUMO\nEste projeto teve por objetivo desenvolver uma bateria de \u00edon-l\u00edtio de alta capacidade para armazenamento de energia renov\u00e1vel, considerando n\u00e3o apenas sua performance, mas tamb\u00e9m seu custo e seguran\u00e7a.

Thus, it is important to develop devices that are compatible with the need of establishing a sustainable and environmental friendly community. Society, then, must make major changes to its energy supply and utilization systems. [1]\nBatteries are devices that contain two electrodes with different chemical potentials connected by a conductive material, the electrolyte. Electrons flow spontaneously from the more negative electrode to the more positive electrode when the battery is connected to an external device. Ions are transported through the electrolyte and then the electrical energy produced can be tapped by the external circuit. Hundreds of electrochemical couples were proposed during the 19th and early 20th centuries. [2]\nRegarding to the battery production itself, there are safety concerns about runaway reactions which can lead to fires, explosions or internal short-circuits. Therefore, improvements in monitoring and management are essential in Lithium-ion batteries to fulfil their potential in the automotive market. Lithium-ion batteries would also need to reduce their carbon footprint. If Lithium-ion batteries are to take place as the batteries of the future, its demand is also concerning. Lithium is found in mines and also in unlimited quantities in sea water. Lithium extraction from brines is much greener (requiring just solar energy) than conventional mining. The demand for lithium could also be eased by recycling. [2]\nIn secondary or rechargeable batteries, a larger voltage applied in the opposite direction can cause the battery to recharge. Not all the batteries are developed equally: nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries, for example, need to be fully discharged, otherwise they quickly lose capacity due to a widely known fact called memory effect. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, contrariwise, have a long life and do not suffer with memory effects. Those batteries operate at higher voltages, have smaller sizes and hold the charge more efficiently. Most of the high-quality portable devices manufactured nowadays profit from this technology. [3]\nLi-ion batteries have, as main advantages, a high energy density, low self-discharge, low maintenance and high current. Those aspects are to be described more effectively through the next section.\nThe purpose of this project was to develop a large capacity Li-ion battery for renewable energy storage, considering not only the performance but also the cost and safety related to the\nbattery. The challenge was to find the best Lithium-ion battery compound (in terms of deepcycling capability, cost and sustainability) suitable for renewable energy applications.\n2.\tLITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1\tBATTERY\nElectrical batteries are devices in which chemical energy is stored and converted to electrical energy on demand through electrochemical reactions. They are composed by cells, which have three main parts: cathode, anode and electrolyte, which will be detailed separately through this section. Cathode and anode can be both referred as half-cells and they cannot have contact with each other, so the presence of a separator is necessary [4].\nBatteries can be classified in two forms: primary and secondary. Primary batteries can only be used once, while secondary batteries (rechargeable batteries) can be charged and discharged multiple times. Secondary batteries are used in portable devices, light vehicles and many other applications [4].\nRedox reactions are responsible for generating power in a battery. Anions in the anode are oxidized and its electrons flows through the electrolyte and cations present in the cathode absorb those electrons. This generates the electricity until one electrode runs out of the substances necessary for the redox reaction. The charge is conducted to the outside of the battery and through the load by the collector [4].\nThe electrical driving force across the cell is the terminal voltage, measured in volts (V). The terminal voltage in a charging cell is always smaller in magnitude than the theoretical voltage, while it exceeds the theoretical voltage when charging due to the internal resistance. An ideal battery does not exhibit internal resistance [4].\nIn Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode during discharge and move back when charging, as it can be seen in Figure 1.\nCHARGING\tDISCHARGING\nFigure 1. Charge and discharge processes in a Li-ion battery.\nThe currently used cathode lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has a low-medium cost, but cobalt is toxic, compromising the safety of the battery. The current graphite (carbon) anode has low prices and is relatively safe although it has a low theoretical capacity compared to other potential materials. Due to those constrains, new electrodes are being developed. Different electrodes will be described further in this section [4].\n2.2\tCATHODE\nA cathode, also known as the positive pole, is a positively charged electrode. Due to this charge, the electrons flow into it when redox reactions occur, which means that a reduction occurs in this half-cell [5].\n2.3\tANODE\nAn anode, also known as the negative pole, is a negatively charged electrode. Thus, existing electrons in this electrode flow towards to the cathode, which means that the direction of electric current is opposite to the direction of electric flow [5].\n2.4\tELECTROLYTE\nWhen electrodes are placed in an electrolyte and a voltage is applied, the electrolyte will conduct electricity. They are necessary to guarantee the flow of electrons, due to the fact that their ions neutralize positive and negative charges from cathode and anode, respectively.\nThe most common electrolyte is LiPF6 in organic solution. There are more efficient electrolytes in market, but this has still the best cost-benefit [5].\n2.5\tC-RATE\nIn describing batteries, discharge current is often expressed as a C-rate, which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is discharged relative to its maximum capacity. A 1C-rate expresses, then, the capacity of the battery in one hour [5].\nFor instance, if a battery has a nominal capacity of 500mAh, the current corresponding to a C-rate of 10 (10C) and a charge or discharge time of 6 minutes would be 5000mA. The current corresponding to a C-rate of 1/2 and a charge or discharge time of 2 hours would be 250mA [5].\n2.6\tDEPTH OF DISCHARGE (DOD)\nDoD is the amount of battery capacity that has been discharged expressed as a percentage of maximum capacity [5].\n2.7\tCYCLE LIFE\nCycle life is the number of discharge/charge cycles the battery can experience before it fails. The higher the DOD, the lower the cycle life [5].\n2.8\tNOMINAL CAPACITY (Ah)\nNominal capacity is the total Ampere-hours available when the battery is discharged at a certain discharge current (C-rate) from 100% state-of-charge to the minimum allowable voltage. It can be calculated by multiplying the discharge current and the discharge time. The increase of C-rate leads to a decreasing of the nominal capacity [5].\n2.9\tNOMINAL ENERGY (Wh)\nNominal energy is the total Watt-hours available when the battery is discharged at the C-rate from 100% state-of-charge to the minimum allowable voltage. It can be calculated by multiplying the discharge power and the discharge time. The increase of C-rate leads to a decreasing of the nominal energy [3].\nThe nominal energy per unit volume (in Wh/L) is often called energy density while the nominal energy per unit mass (in Wh/kg) is often called gravimetric energy density. Both are characteristics of the battery chemistry and packaging [3].\n2.10\tLI-ION BATTERY POSSIBILITIES [6]\nThe main materials for Li-ion batteries are presented in Table 1 and each cathode will be discussed with more details further.\n\tChemical name\tMaterial\tAbbreviation\tShort form\tNotes\nCathode material\tLithium Cobalt Oxide\tLiCoO2 (60% Co)\tLCO\tLi-cobalt\tHigh capacity; for mobile phone, laptop, camera\n\tLithium Manganese Oxide\tLiMn2O4\tLMO\tLi-manganese, or spinel\tMost safe; lower capacity than Li-cobalt but high specific power and long life; for power tools, ebikes, EV, medical, hobbyist.\n\tLithium Iron Phosphate\tLiFePO4\tLFP\tLi-phosphate\t\n\tLithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide\tLiNiMnCoO2 (10-20% Co)\tNM\tNMC\t\n\tLithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxide\tLiNiCoAlO2 9% Co)\tNCA\tNCA\tGaining importance in electric powertrain and grid storage\nAnode material\tLithium Titanate\tLi4Ti5O12\tLTO\tLi-titanate\t\n2.10.1\tLITHIUM COBALT OXIDE (LiCoO2)\nLiCoO2 is a chemical compound widely used in the manufacturing of Li-ion batteries.\nAs can be seen in Figure 2, its crystalline structure consists of lithium ions that lie between oxygen-cobalt slabs.\nWhen assembled in a battery, it consists of a cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite carbon anode, becoming then the most commonly used battery for high-end consumer products.\nFigure 2. Li-cobalt structure. [6]\nIt is of high interest its high specific energy, which makes it good for mobile phones, laptops and digital cameras. However, it has a short life span and limited load capability (specific power), as well as the incapability to discharge in higher rates than 1C. A wider insight of its advantages and drawbacks can be seen in Figure 3.\nThe axis \u2018performance\u2019 demonstrates the influence of the temperature on a lithium cobalt oxide cathode: how is the performance when the temperature is low or high.\nThe axis safety represents risk of overheating followed by explosion, which may be caused by flaws on the assembly, calculations or raw material choices,\nFigure 3. .Snapshot of an average Li-cobalt battery. [6]\n2.10.2\tLITHIUM MANGANESE OXIDE (LiMn2O4)\nIt is a lithium-manganese-oxide based material with a spinel structure. It consists of a 3D framework in which lithium ions are placed, as can be seen in Figure 4.\nIts field of use comprises power tools, medical instruments, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles. Most modern manganese-based Li-ion systems include a blend of nickel and cobalt.\nBetween its strengths there is a high thermal stability and enhanced safety, as well as a lower internal resistance. In addition, lithium manganese oxide is a non-expensive and nontoxic compound. Design flexibility allows engineers to maximize the battery for either optimal longevity (life span), maximum load current (specific power) or high capacity (specific energy) [7].\nOn the other hand, its most important drawbacks are a limited cycle and calendar life, and a lower capability than LiCoO2 (Figure 5).\nFigure 5. Snapshot of a pure Li-manganese battery. [6]\n2.10.3\tLITHIUM IRON PHOSPHATE (LiFePO4)\nLithium Iron Phosphate, also known as LFP, has an olivine crystal structure. It is a nanoscale phosphate cathode material. A zigzag 3D framework is formed by oxygen-iron octahedral sharing common corners with phosphate tetrahedral, as can be seen in Figure 6. Lithium ions are placed within the octahedral channels in a zigzag structure [8].\nFigure 6. Lithium Iron Phosphate structure. [6]\nThis compound has a good electrochemical performance with low resistance, enhanced safety, good thermal stability, high current rating and long cycle life, and it is tolerant to abuse. It has a lower specific energy, cold temperatures reduce its performance, and elevated storage temperature shortens its service life (Figure 7) [6], [8].\nFigure 7.Snapshot of a typical Li-phosphate battery. [6]\n2.10.4\tLITHIUM NICKEL MANGANESE COBALT OXIDE (LiNiMnCoO2)\nLiNiMnCoO2, also known as NMC, is the battery of choice for power tools and powertrains for vehicles. Nickel is known for its high specific energy but low stability; manganese has the benefit of forming a spinel structure to achieve very low internal resistance but offers a low specific energy. The combination of these metals brings out the best of each [6], [7].\nA schematic structure of NMC is shown in Figure 8 below.\nFigure 8. NMC structure. [6]\n\nIn the performance of the compound as a cathode, it is possible to highlight its great\nspecific energy and low self-heating rate, as it can be seen in Figure 9. Contrarily, it is difficult\nto find the right balance between nickel and manganese in order to offer the best performance,\nas manufacturers try to keep the secret of their formulas [6].\nFigure 9. Snapshot of NMC. [6]\n2.10.5\tLITHIUM NICKEL COBALT ALUMINIUM OXIDE (LiNiCoAlO2)\nThis kind of cathode is less commonly used, but the automotive industry is getting interested in it [6]. It presents a high specific energy, high power densities and long life span. However, its cost is relatively high and its level of safety is considerably low (Figure 10).\nFigure 10. Snapshot of NCA. [6]\n2.10.6\tLITHIUM TITANATE (Li^isOn)\nLi4Ti5Oi2 replace graphite in the anode of a typical Li-ion battery and it has a spinel structure, as can be seen in Figure 11 below.\nFigure 11. Li4Ti5Oi2 structure. [6]\nIts performance in a battery presents a fast-charge, a delivery of high discharge current,\nhigher cycle count, good level of safety, and an excellent low temperature discharge (Figure\n12). Although it also has some drawbacks, as low specific energy, which makes it expensive\n[6].\nFigure 12. Snapshot of Li-titanate. [6]\nLithium-polymer differs from other battery systems in the type of electrolyte used. It can be built on many systems, such as LiCoO2, NMC, LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 and works exactly the same way as a normal Li-ion compound. Also, it has a higher specific energy, and can be manufactured in thinner sheets. However, its cost is significantly higher (around 30% more).\n2.10.8\tSOLID ELECTROLYTE WITH LITHIUM-METAL BATTERIES\nThis alternative has higher energy density, yet it presents safety issues, it provides low cycles, and its commercialization is estimated to be possible in around 10 years [2].\nAfter the analysis above, and as the cathode has a bigger and faster degradation, it was decided to focus on it. Thus, by working on the durability itself, other qualities are also improved at the same time. If a high durability cathode is found, then it makes sense to think it will be environmentally friendly, because it will take more time to it to be changed by a brand new battery and so the use of materials will be lower.\n2.11\tUSAGE OF NANOMATERIALS IN ELECTRODES\nAt the nanoscale, properties of the materials can change from properties at macro or micro scale. Due to this, nanomaterials gained attention from all fields [7].\nSolid-state ion diffusion in bulk electrode materials is slow and thus, limits the charge and discharge rate. In order to overcome this, nanoscale electrodes are used, reducing the path lengths and resulting in a fast diffusion [7].\n2.12\tLiFiPO4 AS CATHODE IN LI-ION BATTERY\nLiFePO4 has a low electronic and ionic conductivity. Thus, to use it as a viable cathode material for Li-ion batteries, it is necessary to improve its electrochemical properties, which is done integrating these two methods: nanostructured material and carbon covered material [8].\nThe proposed LiFePO4 has a good electrochemical performance at nano-scale, enhanced safety, good thermal stability, tolerant to abuse and long life cycle (between 2000 and 5000 cycles with 80% DoD) [8].\nAs silicon has a high specific charging capacity (around ten times higher than graphite) and a low discharge potential, it is an interesting alternative for anode. Silicon is not used yet due to its volume expansion in around 400% [9].\nNanowires could improve silicon's properties by increasing the amount of available surface area in contact with the electrolyte, thereby increasing anode's power density and allowing faster charging and higher current delivery. Also, when grown in current collector they are able to reduce the problems associated with the volume expansion [9].\nFurthermore, carbon layers are usually the support for the silicon nanowires (and many other nanostructures), which improves the stability of the anode by buffering the massive volume change during cycles. It also provides satisfactory electrical contacts [9].\nSilicon nanowires have a theoretical capacity of roughly 4.2mAh g-1 and a capacity retention of 89% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles [9].\nDoping impurities to the nanowire anode improves the battery performance, and it study has proven that phosphorus doped silicon nanowires have the possibility of sustaining an 85% of initial capacity after cycling over 6000 times [9].\nAs information regarding to silicon nanowires is not easily available, all the cost analysis for the battery was made considering the use of graphite as the anode.\nFrom the process diagram below (Erro! Fonte de refer\u00eancia n\u00e3o encontrada.), a more detailed study on each equipment needed for battery manufacturing was made. Calculations were based on a daily production of 10 000 cells per day (value estimated according to SAFT AB production [10]). It is a batch and the cost estimation was mainly based on supply companies. The battery should last 5000 cycles with 80% DoD and have a power performance of 55kWh.\nDue to the power requirements of the battery, a large number of cells is needed. Therefore, it was chosen to manufacture a pouch cell in order to save up space when stocking them together.\nContamination between anode and cathode materials ruins the battery, so great care must be taken to prevent these materials from getting in contact with each other. Therefore, anodes and cathodes are usually processed in different rooms, which means that even if the same equipment is used to produce both electrodes, more than one equipment is needed in the production line.\nThere are many different strategies developed to manufacture a battery. The choice of procedure adopted through this section was made by analysing the availability of the equipment (based on its specifications) and raw materials required for the manufacturing. Thus, it was decided to follow the instructions of a company that explains the assembly and sells the equipment. By following barely one procedure, the calculation related to design (sizes and capacities) of each equipment and raw material demanded becomes more practical and realistic. Similar procedures were studied and can be seen through references [11], [12] and [13].\nThe following explanation, then, is based on the procedure described by MTI Corporation [14]. The equipment (and its prices and characteristics) used for further calculation are also from this company.\nFigure 13.

For battery production, a high accuracy is desired, once a poorly mixed material for the electrodes can cause great variations on the energy storage capacity and life cycles.\nPaste mixing means blending together solid and liquid materials in order to form a paste. This paste is the most important component in the battery, the positive and negative electrodes.\nEquipment Characteristics\nEquipment specifications are presented on Table 4 and Figure 16 below.\nTable 4.

The positive is made of aluminium and the negative is made of copper. The role of these current collectors is to transfer electric current to and from the battery terminals during discharge and charge processes, and once coated with the paste, are referred as positive and negative plates.\nThe drying process is necessary to prevent any moisture in the electrodes. If water is present, the number of cycles can reduce significantly, once the moisture interferes in the attachment of the paste in the collector.\nEquipment Characteristics\nEquipment specifications are presented on Table 5 and Figure 17 below.\nTable 5.

There is a severe capacity loss at higher rate for thicker electrodes as well as a significant loss of power density and deterioration of long-term cycling performance. A non-homogeneous distribution causes a high-density area that charges and discharges faster, reducing considerably the number of cycles of the battery.\nCompressing the electrode minimizes the porosity therefore increase the power density.\nEquipment Characteristics\nEquipment specifications are presented on Table 6 and Figure 18 below.\nTable 6.

Ultrasonic welding machine [14].\nProcess\nIn an ultrasonic welding machine, high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are locally applied to work pieces being held together under pressure to create a solid-state weld.\nThe benefits of ultrasonic welding are that it is much faster than conventional adhesives or solvents. The drying time is very quick, and the pieces do not need to remain in a jig for long periods of time waiting for the j oint to dry or cure. The welding can easily be automated, making clean and precise joints; the site of the weld is very clean and rarely requires any touch-up work.\nThe low thermal impact on the materials involved enables a greater number of materials to be welded together.\nCost\n\u2022 Purchase: $ 22 000,00\n3.3.4.\tSHORTCUT DETECTOR\nPurpose: to test if the cell has short-circuit.

Wattmeter [14].\nProcess\nThe purpose of a short-circuit test is to determine the series branch parameters of the equivalent circuit of a real transformer. It is conducted on the high-voltage side of the transformer and the low-voltage side is short circuited, which means that a voltmeter, ammeter and wattmeter are on the high-voltage side of the circuit.\nThe supply voltage required to circulate current through the transformer is usually very small. Also, the core losses are very small because applied voltage is only a few percentage of the nominal voltage and hence can be neglected. Thus the wattmeter reading measures only the full load copper loss, which gives values approximately equivalent to the resistance and reactance of the transformer. It is estimated that 0.5% of the electrodes are recycled.\nCost per equipment\n\u2022 Purchase: $598,00\n3.3.5.\tVACUUM OVEN\nPurpose: to dry the cell if it has no short-circuit.\nEquipment Characteristics\nEquipment specifications are presented on Table 11 and Figure 23 below.\nTable 11 Vacuum oven specifications [14].\nPower\t\u2022\t208-240V \u2022\t1500W\nWorking Temperature\t\u2022\tT ~ 200\u00b0C for continuous \u2022\t200\u00b0C ~ 250\u00b0C for&lt;4hrs \u2022\tMaximum Heating Rate: 4~6 \u00b0C/min\nVacuum Level\t\u2022 A vacuum pump required to operate the oven\nFigure 23.

This calculation is to be explained more deeply in the next section.\nTo connect the cells a silicone jacked copper wire (Gauge 26) is used.\nBoth the wires and the battery box are not considered in this production process, so they must be purchased.

In order to analyse the cost involved in the process, a material balance needs to be done.\nThe battery production is described in the diagram already presented in Erro! Fonte de refer\u00eancia n\u00e3o encontrada.. The cells are produced individually and then assembled in a larger battery.\nThe material balance was made considering a production of 10 000 cells per day based on a smaller/medium production. It was chosen to do the calculations with a high amount of cells to estimate the costs of production in a larger scale. In other words, to check the profitability of a real production. It was set that the cells produced have the following specifications (Table 20):\nTable 20. Battery cells specifications.\nBattery s\tpecification - per cell\t\nCurrent\t5 000\tmAh\nCapacity\t16,5\tWh\nVoltage\t3,3\tV\nAs it was stated in the introduction, the battery set should fulfil voltage and capacity requirements as shown in Table 21 below:\nTable 21. Battery set specifications.\nBattery specification - per set\t\t\nCapacity\t27,5\tkWh\nVoltage\t48\tV\nCells should be assembled in a way to meet the set specifications. When cells are arranged in series, the voltage is increased by the sum of the voltages of each cell in series; if they are arranged in parallel, the capacity is increased by the sum of the capacities of each cell in parallel. Thus, it is necessary to have a series and parallel arrangement to increase both voltage and capacity and then fulfil the set specifications. For each parallel arrangement, a complete series is necessary and the total number of cells is obtained by multiplying parallel with series requirements. Equations and results are presented below:\n\u2022 For the series arrangement:\nVset\nFor the parallel arrangement:\n^parallel\ncapacityset =\ncapacity^11\ni\n\u2022 The total number of cells is given by:\ntotal number of cell = Nparauei x Nseries\nThe results obtained that fulfil our specifications are presented in Table 22 below:\nTable 22 Number of cells needed per set.\nNumber of cells needed per set\t\t\nParallel\t114,583\t115\nSeries\t14,545\t15\nTotal\t1 666,667\t1 725\nThus, the total number of cells required per set is 1725 cells, with 115 rows and 15 cells in each row.\n4.1.\tMASS OF ACTIVE MATERIAL\nThe amount of active material per cells can be obtained by the specific capacity of each material (cathode and anode). For LiFePO4 the specific capacity is 170 mAh/g and for graphite the specific capacity is 372 mAh/g. Thus, in order to achieve the capacity of 5000 mAh for each cell, the amount of necessary material can be obtained by simply dividing the capacity of the cell by the specific capacity of the battery. The obtained results are presented in Table 23 below:\nTable 23. Amount of necessary active material per cell.\nAmount of Active material\nCathode\tSpecific energy\t\tPer cell (g)\nLiFePO4 (nano)\t170,000\tmAh/g\t29,412\n\t8,160\tWh/g\t\nAnode\t\t\t\nGraphite\t372,000\tmAh/g\t13,441\n\t17,856\tWh/g\t\nThe amount of other materials in the cell, such as binders and solvents are based on the amount of active material in the cell.\nFor the cathode, the mass fraction of LiFePO4 is 93.5% of the total mass of the mixture. For the anode, the mass fraction of graphite is 94.5% of the total mass of the mixture. Based on this and on the amount of active material calculated above is possible to obtain the total mass of the mixture and consequently the amount of the other components. It is shown below the mixture for the cathode and the anode.\nCathode:\n-\tLiFePO4: 93.5%\n-\tPVDF: 2.25%\n-\tSuper-C45: 4.0%\n-\tNMP: 53.3% of the solid content w/w\nAnode:\n-\tGraphite: 94.5%\n-\tCMC: 2.25%\n-\tSBR: 2.25%\n-\tSuper P: 1.0%\n-\tDeionized water: 120% of the Graphite w/w\nThe mass of these materials in a single cell is presented in Table 24 below:\nTable 24.

As it is explained in \u2018Battery manufacture: Process and equipment\u2019 section above, the process for cathode and anode preparations are made separately and after ready an assembling process is needed. The mass balance presented in this report focuses on the preparation process, since the battery composition remain constant after assembling. The balance was calculated for cathode and anode individually. For the calculations of the mass balance some assumption were made, such as efficiencies and losses in each equipment. The complete calculation and tables of results are presented in the Appendix.\n4.2.\tCATHODE MATERIAL BALANCE\nThe material for the cathode (LiFePO4) is supplied in form of nanoparticles and ready for the paste preparation. In the first step, a mixing of the active material with the binder (PVDF), conductive material (Super C-45) and solvent (NMP) is necessary to form the cathode paste. Losses were estimated in 2% [17] due to paste\u2019s consistency, which tends to stick inside the mixer. Table 26 below shows the outlet stream from the mixer. The feed of raw materials is made in individual streams.\nStream 5\t\t\t\t\t\n\tMass (kg/day)\tSolid Mass fraction\tMass fraction\tVol (m3/day)\tVol Fraction\nLiFePO4\t288,235\t0,935\t0,610\t0,096\t0,282\nPVDF\t7,090\t0,023\t0,015\t0,004\t0,012\nSuper C-45\t12,947\t0,042\t0,027\t0,081\t0,237\nNMP\t164,412\t0,000\t0,348\t0,160\t0,469\nTotal solid\t308,273\t1,000\t0,652\t0,181\t0,531\nTotal mass\t472,685\t\t1,000\t0,341\t1,000\nAfter leaving the mixer, the paste is ready to be coated on the current collector. In the case of the cathode, the current collector is an aluminium foil. Losses on the coating were estimated as 1% due to the tendency of sticking inside the equipment. Also, losses of volatile compounds and arrested particles are considered since it is a coater with a heater attached to it in order to prevent moisture in the electrode. The amount of arrested particles was estimated in 1% and the volatile compounds (solvent) losses were estimated in 10%. Thus, there are two outlet streams from the coating: exhausted gases and coated electrode. Table 27 and Table 28 below show the calculation results of the outlet stream for the cathode coating and the coating/heater exhausted gases stream.\nTable 27.

Considering a coating thickness of 150 um. is possible to obtain the area covered by the coating. As an aluminium foil with a constant width is used, the length of the foil can be simply obtained dividing the coating area by the width of the foil, as shown in the equation below:\nA\nf ___ ^coating\nLai =\nWAl\nTable 29 shows the calculations and assumptions of the calculation in the aluminium foil length.\nTable 29.

For each of this process, losses of 2% were applied. The outlet stream from the slithering is presented on Table 30 below:\nLiFePOfGraphite Lithium ion Battery at 25\u00b0C and 1bar.\nStream 11\t\t\t\t\t\n\tMass (kg/day)\tSolid Mass fraction\tMass fraction\tVol (m3/day)\tVol Fraction\nLiFePO4\t271,285\t0,899\t0,607\t0,090\t0,265\nPVDF\t6,607\t0,022\t0,015\t0,004\t0,011\nSuper C- 45\t12,064\t0,040\t0,026\t0,075\t0,221\nNMP\t139,269\t0,000\t0,312\t0,135\t0,397\nTotal solid\t289,956\t0,960\t0,676\t0,170\t0,556\nTotal mass\t429,225\t\t0,959\t0,305\t0,895\nAfter slithering, cathode is winded together with the separator and anode. Further, a sequence of assembling, testing and drying process is made. The drying process does not change the composition in the battery, it is mainly responsible for keeping it dry from moisture in the air. Some of the assembling and testing process are held in a drying room.\n4.3.\tANODE MATERIAL BALANCE\nThe active material for the anode graphite is supplied in form of raw graphite, which needs a pretreatment in a furnace and windmill. After the pretreatment, graphite is mixture with the binder (CMC and SBR), conductive material (Super P) and solvent (di-H2O), forming the anode's paste. Mixer losses were estimated as 2% due to stick inside the equipment [17]. Table 31 presents the outlet stream for anode's mixer.\nTable 31.

In the anode's case, the current collector is a copper foil. Losses on the coating were estimated as 1% due to stick inside the equipment. Moreover, losses of volatile compounds and arrested particles are\n59\nconsidered since it is a coater with a heater attached to it in order to prevent moisture in the electrode. Particles arrested were estimated in 1% and the volatile compounds (solvent) losses were estimated in 15% [17]. The volatile compound losses are higher for the anode since water (anode's solvent) is more volatile than NMP (cathode's solvent). As in the coating process on the cathode, there are also two outlet stream from the coating for the anode, the exhausted gases and the coated electrode. Table 32 and Table 33 below show the calculation results of the outlet stream for the anode coating and the coating/heater exhausted gases stream.\nTable 32.

Finally, the total investment cost or grass root plant cost is obtained by multiplying the total purchase cost by a factor [17] that takes into account direct and indirect costs, such as auxiliaries, installation, building for the process and engineering.

In order to calculate the product storage cost, some assumptions are used:\n\u2022\tThe storage cost of one battery is $ 200/kWh.\n\u2022\t5 batteries sets are produced per day.\n\u2022\t30 days of storage.\n\u2022\t$ 650/kWh is the battery price.\nStorage costs product\t\t\t\t\t\nMaterial\tQ (Battery/year)\tP ($/battery)\tDays of storage\tfa\tAnnual cost ($/year)\nBattery\t1500,00\t17875,00\t30\t0,20\t440753,42\nThe product storage cost is $440.753, 42 per year.\n5.2.4.\tMAINTENANCE COST\nThe maintenance cost is obtained by multiplying the grass root plant cost by a factor, 8% [17]. Then, the maintenance cost is M$3,74.\n5.2.5.\tSPARE PARTS\nThe spare parts cost is obtained by multiplying the maintenance cost by a factor, 5% [17]. Then, the spare parts cost is $112.225,15.\n5.2.6.\tELECTRICITY COST\nThe electricity cost is based on the usage of electricity of equipment already exposed in \u2018Battery manufacture: Process and equipment' section above. Equipment such as calender, slitting and winding machines are doubled in order to increase the speed of production and to guarantee that it will not stop if one of the equipment needs to be repaired. Table 42 below shows the power requirement for each equipment.\nTable 42.

As it is presented o Table 43, the energy consumption is 657,86 kWh/day and the total annual energy cost is $6.986,58.\nTable 43. Total energy cost.\nTheoretical Total Power (W)\t24650,00\nElectrical efficiency\t0,90\nTotal Power (W)\t27388,89\nWorking hours (h)\t24\nTotal energy (MJ/day)\t2366,40\nTotal energy (kWh/day)\t657,86\nCost energy (SEK/kWh)\t0,30\nTotal energy cost (SEK/day)\t197,36\nTotal energy cost ($/day)\t23,29\nTotal energy cost ($/year)\t6986,58\nThe electricity cost includes also the dry room operational cost, which is based on the assumption that its daily cost is $200. The dry room operational cost is $1.440.000 per year.\nThe total electricity cost is then $1.446.986,58 per year.\n5.2.7.\tTOTAL OPERATING COST\nThe total operating cost (Table 44) is calculated based on the sum of the operating costs described above and taking into account the licence fees cost (a factor of 6% of the operating cost [17], as mentioned in the \u2018Operator cost\u2019 section above).\nTable 44.

Selling product specifications.\nSelling product specifications\t\nSelling price per battery ($/kWh)\t650\nBattery storage capacity (kWh/set)\t27,5\nNumber of batteries per day (set/day)\t5\nNumber of batteries per year (set/year)\t1500\nBattery selling price ($/set)\t17875,00\nTable 46.

If the battery price is decreased, the payoff time increases, so a sensitivity analysis was made in order to evaluate some uncertain parameters in the payoff calculation.\n5.4.\tSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nSensitivity analysis are usually carried out in order to evaluate uncertain parameters in a mathematical model or in a cost model. The assumptions made during the cost estimation can 67\nsignificantly change the product final cost. Thus, it is very important to evaluate the impact of deviations on your expectations and how is their influence in the payoff time.\nInitially, a breakdown of the costs was made for a better overview of the cost influence. In Figure 31 it can be seen the relation between the investment cost (equipment cost) and the operational cost annually. As expected, the initial cost of the industry is much higher than the operation cost, since purchase of equipment and installations cost can be expensive.\nBreakdown of costs\n\u25a0 Equipment cost \u25a0 Operational cost\nFigure 31. Breakdown of costs.\nAs the operational costs include different types of cost in it, a breakdown of all the operational costs was made (Figure 32). It can be seen that the material cost is responsible for 36% of the total operation cost. Other major costs are maintenance, labour expenses and electricity. In order to reduce operational costs, the main focus should be on reducing the materials prices and labour expenses, since maintenance and electricity are more inflexible costs.\nFigure 32. Inside operational cost.\nThe major material costs are LiFePO4 and di-H2O. LiFePO4 is supplied ready for the cathode paste production, however an analysis can be made for a raw lithium material be supplied and auxiliaries\u2019 facilities produce LiFePO4 particles and a lower price can be obtained. Another approach can be obtain a lower price from another supplier. For the di-H2O, it can be easily produced inside the factory, since the equipment to produce deionized water are quite common and usually not expensive.\nIn order to analyse the influence of the materials cost in the payoff time, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The materials cost was swept in -40%, -20%, -10%, 10%, 20% and 40% of the current considered material cost. It is possible to see in Figure 33 that the reduction of this cost will not play an expressive role in the decreasing of the payoff time.\nMaterial sensitivity analysis\n1\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\no\n05 Q_\n05\n<D\n<D\nE\n\t\t0%\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\to o\t\tT +40%\t\nm -40%\t\t1\tni +10%\t+20%\t\t\n\tz -20%\t-10%\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n7\n9\nOperational Cost\n11\t13\t15\t17\t19\t21\nFigure 33. Material sensitivity analysis.\nAnother analysis takes into account the influence of the battery price in the payoff time.\nThe results are shown in Figure 34 below.\nBattery price sensitivity analysis\nBattery price ($/set)\nFigure 34. Battery price sensitivity analysis.\nThe battery selling price plays an important role on the payoff time. The choice of the price is strongly related to the market price, so this factor should be taken into account when deciding a real price for the battery. The chosen value, $650/kWh, is reasonable in terms of market price and payoff time, but its decrease would turn the battery into a more competitive\nproduct. It is important to observe that the decrease of the battery price leads to an exponential increase of the payoff time.\nAs a further sensitivity analysis, the number of cells produced per day could be changed, in order to evaluate the impact of a smaller or bigger production in the battery price, payoff time and operational costs.\n6.\tRECYCLING CONSIDERATIONS\nBesides all environmental benefits of recycling, there are some potential economic reasons for it. It often pays off to recover the materials since the disposal is quite costly.\nFor safety, most processes uses techniques to reduce the activity of the components. Two major processes are known for that, the first involves calcining to bake out the electrolyte which deactivates the cells and allows the disassembly. The second uses cryogenic process to reduce the reactivity of the constituents [47], [48]. This second process is largely used and therefore will be described here.\nThe batteries are chilled to -325F in liquid nitrogen, and then are sheared into three pieces in a caustic bath, which neutralizes any acidic components and dissolves the lithium salts. The salts are precipitated and dewatered in filter presses and then used to produce lithium carbonate. Hydrogen and organics burn off at the surface of the process bath. The remaining large pieces are passed through a hammer mill, after which ferrous and nonferrous metals are recovered. Plastics and paper float to the top and are recovered for disposal or recycling. The carbon sludge is filtered out and collected as a cake. Materials are stored in bunkers and fumes are scrubbed. Next, the remainder is crushed and sifted, and hydrometallurgical processes are used to separate the metallic components. The process recovers steel or aluminium containers, copper and aluminium support, lithium hydroxides, and carbon. It is unclear how carbon is recovered as a saleable product, but since no Nickel or Cobalt are used, the process is feasible [47].\nRecycling of large batteries is much easier than recycling of small consumer cells, the collection logistics are straightforward, the batteries will be large enough to warrant separation by type to maximize the value of the recovered materials and there is enough material in fairly large pieces to justify at least partial disassembly [47].\n7.\tCONCLUSIONS\nThe materials choice in this project was made considering environmental relevant aspects, such as safety and the absence of heavy metals in the composition, as well as capacity of storage and availability for production.\nAs nanowires are still under research, information for industrial production was not available. Another option for this electrode is graphite, because it is widely used, it is cheap and has suitable properties.\nA cost analysis was performed considering the industrial production process of a Li-ion battery using raw materials and equipment available in the market. The grass root total cost was M$46,76 and the annual operation cost is M$13,21. A payoff method was applied and the payoff time obtained was 5 years.\nAfter some parametric sweeping, it was possible to conclude that the materials cost does not have an expressive influence in the payoff time. However, the selling price of the battery plays an important role, resulting in a range of 13 years between the cheapest ($500/kWh) and the most expensive ($800/kWh) prices. Thus, it is possible to conclude that it would be interesting to sell the battery for $650/kWh just as it was used as a consideration in the beginning of chapter 4.\nThe industry designed in this project is economically feasible for the price range mentioned above, depending mainly on a considerable initial investment.\n8.\tREFERENCES\n[1]\tDELL, D.
