The share of the forest sector in the national \neconomy, which has a participation of approximately 4.5% \nof GDP, clearly shows the importance of this genus for the \ncountry is grown on an area of   6.5 million hectares and \ngenerates about 4.73 million jobs (ABRAF 2012).\n\nWith the expansion of eucalyptus cultivation to warmer \nand more humid regions and with the impact of climate \nchanges, conditions have become favorable for the occur-\nrence of diseases (Telechea et al. 2003, Glen et al. 2007). \nConsequently, the planting of susceptible species and the \nuninterrupted use of the same cultivation areas increase the \nchances of pest attacks.\n\nOne of the major diseases of Eucalyptus today is rust. \nThe economic problems resulting from rust are related to \nplanting in the field (Ferreira 1983), where fungicide treat-\nments are practically unfeasible. The vegetative growth \nof Eucalyptus grandis trees infected with this pathogenic \nfungus can be reduced by 28% to 35%, compared to unaf-\n\nfected plants, resulting in direct losses in productivity and \neconomic gains.\n\nNowadays, several forms of rust control are being applied, \nfor example: fungicide treatment, tree harvest for regrowth \nin disease-unfavorable seasons and cultivation of resistant \nplants. For a number of reasons, the use of resistant variet-\nies is the most indicated measure: it is cheap, practical and \nhas less environmental impacts for requiring less fungicide \napplication (Carvalho et al. 1998.).\n\nResistant plants can be selected in the field in progeny \nand clonal tests (Zobel and Talbert 1984, Alfenas et al. 2004, \nTeixeira et al. 2009), in areas where the disease is severe, \nendemic or even by infection through artificial inoculation \nin a controlled environment (Xavier et al. 2001).\n\nA series of studies on rust have been conducted for the \ngenus Eucalyptus (Dianese et al. 1984, Freeman et al. 2008, \nZauza et al. 2010, Miranda et al. 2013, Silva et al. 2013) in \nview of the great commercial importance for the country. \nHowever, there are few reports in the literature about the \ndisease in the species Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden, although \n\n\n\n188 Crop Breeding and Applied Biotechnology 14: 187-193, 2014\n\nCS Pinto et al.\n\nthe occurrence of the disease in the field has been observed. \nTherefore, this study evaluated the genetic variability in E. \ndunnii progenies for rust resistance caused by Puccinia psidii.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nTwo trials of E. dunnii open-pollinated progenies were \n\nset up in the field (Itapetininga and Itatinga, SP, see Table \n1), in July 2009. The trials were arranged in a randomized \nblock design with 60 and 48 progenies, both with eight \nplants per plot with six replications, in a 3 x 2 m spacing The \ntrial into the controlled environment (inoculation chamber) \nwas carried out in the Department of Crop Science in the \nSector of Plant Protection and Plant Breeding of S\u00e3o Paulo \nState University (UNESP), in Botucatu, SP, Brazil, by the \nrandomized blocks with 53 progenies, with nine plants per \nplot and six replications, totalizing 2,544 plants. The total \nused progenies in the controlled environment trial, 48 were \nset up at Itapetininga, and all of 53 were at Itatinga.\n\nInoculation was performed with an uredospore solution \nof P. psidii from plants of a spontaneously infected rose \napple (Syzygium jambos) tree, in a controlled environment. \nThe spores were scraped from the leaves with a stylus and \nsuspended in distilled water plus Tween 20% to reach a \nconcentration of 9 x 104 spores mL-1. The suspension was \nsprayed on all plants with an air compressor (Chiaperini\u00ae \n2,3pcm, Model E48C) to ensure an even distribution of \nthe spore suspension. The test temperature was maintained \nat 22 \u00b0C, the average relative humidity was 80% and the \nphotoperiod 12 hours, for 15 days, until evaluations.\n\nThe following characteristics were evaluated in progeny \nfield trials: tree height (H) and severity of fungal attack, to \ncorrelate the attack intensity with the development of the \nprogenies. Evaluations were performed every three months \nfor severity, with four assessments, and every six months \nfor height, with two evaluations. Data on the severity of rust \nattack were collected in the field, based on grade criteria from \n0 to 4, where: 0 - resistant plant; 1 - sporadic sporulation; \n2 - generalized sporulation, but no apparent damage to the \nplant; 3 - generalized sporulation on leaves and branches, \ncausing major damage and 4 - advanced disease, with loss \nof apical dominance. To determine resistance levels in E. \n\ndunnii progenies we used a grade scale adapted by Aparecido \net al. (2003), and the data were previously transformed to \n\n5.0+x .\n\nThe genetic parameters for each individual test were \nestimated using the program SELEGEN (Resende 2007) \nmodel 93, by the statistical model: y = Xr + Za +  Wp + e, \nwhere y is the data vector, r the vector of effects of repli-\ncations (assumed as fixed) added to the overall mean, a is \nthe vector of individual additive genetic effects (assumed \nas random), p is the vector of plot effects (random) and \ne is the error or residue vector (random). Capital letters \nrepresent the incidence matrices for these effects. X, Z and \nW are known incidence matrices formed by the values zero \nand one, which associate the unknown r, a and p to the data \nvector y, respectively. By the mixed model methodology r \ncan be estimated by the generalized least square procedure \nand predict a and p by the BLUP procedure. The REML \nprocedure (method of maximum likelihood) was performed \nbased on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, \nwhere the resolutions of the matrices provide estimates of \nadjusted effects of the calculated vectors. The following \ngenetic parameters were estimated:\n\na) Additive genetic variance (?? 2a)\n\n?? 2a = [?'

These values   indicate good experi-\nmental accuracy for field trials and controlled environments \nin species of the genus Eucalyptus (Garcia 1989).\n\nThe values   of the estimates for individual narrow-sense \nheritability were moderate (h? 2a = 0.48 and 0.37) and high \n\nfor mean progeny heritability (h? 2m = 0.84 and 0.64) into the \ninoculation chamber and in Itapetininga trial, indicating low \ninfluence of the environment on the rust resistence (Resende \n2007). The values   were similar to those reported by Mori et \nal. (2004) for rust resistance in E. grandis progenies under \nfield conditions.\n\nIn the region of Itatinga, heritability was generally low, \nindicating the influence of environmental factors on trait \nexpression. In the case of rust resistance, this can be influ-\nenced by the low availability of inoculum in the environment.\n\nIn general, estimates of the coefficient of individual ge-\nnetic variation (CVgi) were higher than the variation among \nprogenies (CVgp) for rust resistance. Lowest values of CVgi \n(2.1%) and CVgp (1.0%) were observed for rust severity in \nthe Itatinga field trial, and highest values of CVgi  (36.1%) \nand CVgp (18.0%) were found in the progeny trial in the \ninoculation chamber. The high CVgi values show possi-\nbilities for selection in breeding programs. Miranda et al. \n(2013) found very similar CVgi values (11.7% - 36.7%) for \nEucapyptus grandis by nine different locations.\n\nThe relative coefficients of variation (CVr) were low, \nmedium and high, in the experiments in Itatinga, Itapetin-\ninga, and the controlled environment, respectively (Table \n2). According to Vencovsky and Barriga (1992), the higher \nthe CVr value, the greater is the genetic control of traits \nand the lower is the influence by environmental factors, \nfavoring selection.\n\nThe experimental coefficient of variation (CVexp) for H \n(Table 3), evaluated after six and 12 months, was high in \nboth field trialts. The highest CVexp values   were found in \nItapetining (19% after 6 months and 21.7% after 12 months). \nIn Itatinga, CVexp was adequate (15.2% after 6 months and \n14.3% after 12 months), which is close to values found in \n\nTable 2.

This may indicate that about 90% of the variation \nin Itapetininga and 40% in Itatinga may be induced by the \nenvironment. The h? 2a values   found in Itatinga, at the two \nages for H, were higher than values   found in the literature \n(Rocha et al. 2007, Rosado et al. 2009), in their studies with \nE. urophylla. For mean progeny heritability (h? 2mp), the high-\nest values   found for Itatinga show that the environment had \nlittle influence on the phenotypic expression of H.\n\nThe coefficients of individual genetic variation (CVgi \n%) were higher than those of genetic variation of progenies \n(CVgp %) in both experiments and at both ages. In the tests, \nCVgi % varied from 9.8% for Itapetininga/SP, after 12 \nmonths, to 26.7% for Itatinga/SP after 6 months. The same \ntrend was found for CVgp %. The results show the genetic \nvariability for the trait ALT, under the experimental condi-\ntions of the study site.\n\nThe coefficients of relative variation (CVr) were high in \nItatinga, with an approximate value of 0.87, at both ages. In \nItapetining however, the values   were close to 0.27,   similar \nto the values found for open-pollinated progenies of E. \nurophylla (CVr =0.21) after 17 years for plant height, in \n\nTable 3.

According to Vencovsky \nand Barriga (1992), these values   are considered low. The \nlow CVr values indicate that the genetic control of the trait \nis low and highly influenced by the environment. Accord-\ning to Vencovsky (1978), the CVr estimates close to 1 are \nrecommendable.\n\nThe genetic and phenotypic correlations are presented \nin Table 4. The correlations were highest for the character \nheight (H), between different ages in the same environment. \nThe high values   show that the performance of the genotypes \ndoes not vary with increasing age. This behavior is important \nin the case of early selection.\n\nFor rust, the highest correlation was found between \nItapetininga and inoculation chamber, where a genetic cor-\nrelation (rg) of 0.50 was observed. However, the same was \nnot true for the phenotypic correlation (rf), where a value \nof 0.04 was calculated. When progeny performance, tree \nheight, and rust susceptibility were correlated, the values   \nwere very low, indicating that the poor performance of the \nplant material had no influence on rust attack. This may \nhave occurred because of the low rust-susceptibility of the \nspecies, or to the low availability of inoculum in the area of \nthe field trials. In general, the correlations found in this study \nwere low, hampering indirect selection for the studied traits.\n\nThe estimates of genetic parameters in the combined \nanalysis for rust in all three environments in pairwise analysis \n(controlled environment/Itapetininga, controlled environ-\nment/Itatinga and Itapetininga/Itatinga) and for the trait \nplant height in Itapetininga/Itatinga are shown in Table 5.\n\nThe combined analysis showed mean and low values   for \nheritability. The values   were highest in the analysis between \ntests of inoculation chamber and Itapetininga. The lowest \nvalues on the other hand   were observed in the combined \nanalysis of the two field tests for rust resistance.\n\nThe genotypes x environments (GE) interactions were \n\nhigh in the rust analysis in three environments, between the \ntest controlled environment/Itapetininga and at both ages \nfor plant height. This shows the presence of a complex \nGE interaction. In this case, the decision on selection is \nmore difficult, since the selection of genotypes adapted to \nspecific environments is required. Miranda et al. (2013) \nobserved strong genetic control associated with rust resis-\ntance between provenances of E. grandis. For resistance \nin interspecific Eucalyptus hybrids to P. psidii, Alves et \nal. (2012) observed that quantitative additive and epistatic \ntrait loci explain between 29.8 and 44.8% of the phenotypic \nvariation, respectively. This is evidence of a more complex \ninheritance pattern of the trait. The genotypic correlation \nbetween the progeny performance in various environments \n(r?gloc= 0.21) was considered low. Still, this interaction could \nbe exploited in a positive way in breeding programs since \nit allows directing a particular genotype towards a specific \nregion, maximizing the phenotypic trait expression in this \nenvironment. However, if the genotype is directed towards \nanother region, its phenotypic value might be reduced.\n\nIn summary, this study shows the great potential of the \nstudied populations of E. dunnii for selection and breeding, \nwith a view to rust resistance, since 70% of the progenies \nobtained grade zero (resistant plants) and the genetic vari-\nability for rust resistance in the studied population was good \n(CVgi = 36.07%). The genetic correlation between the test \nin the controlled environment and field test in Itapetininga \nwas also good (rg = 0.50); this shows that the controlled \nenvironment is a good alternative for early selection of \nplant material for rust resistance to obtain progress in the E. \ndunnii breeding program for rust. It is noteworthy that the \ngenetic correlation between the controlled environment and \nItatinga (CI/R2) is zero, which prevents a selection under \ncontrolled conditions for response to selection in Itatinga. \nEven the field data showed no genotypic correlation between \nItatinga and Itapetininga.\n\nTable 5.

Prog\u00eanies de poliniza\u00e7\u00e3o aberta foram estabelecidas em um \ndelineamento em blocos casualizados. Em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de campo foram avaliadas 60 e 48 prog\u00eanies em dois locais, com seis repeti\u00e7\u00f5es \ne oito plantas por parcela. Instalou-se tamb\u00e9m um experimento em ambiente controlado, com 53 prog\u00eanies, em blocos casualizados, \ncom seis repeti\u00e7\u00f5es e nove plantas por parcela. Foram avaliadas altura da planta e a severidade de ataque que determinam a fase \nmais suscet\u00edvel \u00e0 doen\u00e7a foliar. A popula\u00e7\u00e3o de E. dunnii estudada apresentou alta variabilidade gen\u00e9tica para resist\u00eancia \u00e0 ferrugem, \ncom coeficiente de varia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica de 36,07% e 70% das prog\u00eanies avaliadas foram imunes a ferrugem. Isto indica alto potencial \npara sele\u00e7\u00e3o e melhoramento da esp\u00e9cie.\nPalavras-chave: Eucalyptus, par\u00e2metros gen\u00e9tico, teste de prog\u00eanies, melhoramento gen\u00e9tico florestal.\n\n\n\nGenetic variability in progenies of Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden for resistance to Puccinia psidii\n\n193Crop Breeding and Applied Biotechnology 14: 187-193, 2014\n\nVencovsky R and Barriga P (1992) Gen\u00e9tica biom\u00e9trica no \nfitomelhoramento.
