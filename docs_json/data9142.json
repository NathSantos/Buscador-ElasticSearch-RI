Cristina Oddone*, Alberto F. de Amorim**, Patr\u00edcia L. Mancini*** and Walter Norbis****\n\nSpecimens of Rioraja agassizi were collected monthly off Santos, Southeast Brazil, between latitudes 23\u00b037\u2019S and 27\u00b040\u2019S,\nfrom March, 2005 to March, 2006. A total number of 278 males and 1023 females were captured. Observed depth range was 10-\n120 m, being the species absent above 120 m. Sex ratio significantly favored females. The entire length range of R. agassizi was\nobserved. Females ranged in length from 16.0 to 59.4 cm and males from 13.0 to 47.2 cm. Mean female length was significantly\nhigher than that of males. For grouped length distributions, asymmetry patterns were observed in both sexes. Length-width\nfunctions were sexually dimorphic. Males with lengths &lt;24.5 cm were relatively wider than females. Length-total weight curves\nwere significantly different than length-gutted weight ones, in both sexes. Females were heavier than males for a given TL\nclass. The angular coefficient b was significantly&lt;3 (negative allometry) in the males, and also for the females with exception\nof spring when b was >3 (positive allometry). The monthly variation of the condition factor showed significant differences in\nboth sexes.\n\nEsp\u00e9cimes de Rioraja agassizi foram mensalmente coletados em \u00e1guas ao largo de Santos, sudeste do Brasil entre as latitudes\n23\u00b037\u2019S e 27\u00b040\u2019S, desde mar\u00e7o de 2005 at\u00e9 mar\u00e7o de 2006. Um total de 278 machos e 1023 f\u00eameas foi capturado. A amplitude de\nprofundidade de ocorr\u00eancia foi 10-120 m, estando a esp\u00e9cie ausente em profundidades >120 m. A raz\u00e3o sexual favoreceu as\nf\u00eameas. A amplitude completa de comprimentos de R. agassizi esteve representada e oscilou nas f\u00eameas entre 16.0-59.4 cm\ncomprimento e nos machos entre 13.0-47.2 cm. O tamanho m\u00e9dio das f\u00eameas foi significativamente maior do que dos machos.\nA distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de freq\u00fc\u00eancia de comprimentos por amostras agrupadas foi assim\u00e9trica em ambos os sexos. As curvas da\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o comprimento-largura foram sexualmente dim\u00f3rficas. As f\u00eameas foram mais largas que os machos em todas as classes de\ncomprimento maiores do que 25 cm. As curvas comprimento-peso total foram significativamente diferentes das curvas\ncomprimento-peso eviscerado em ambos os sexos. As f\u00eameas foram mais pesadas do que os machos para uma determinada\nclasse de comprimento. O coeficiente angular b foi&lt;3 nos machos (alometr\u00eda negativa) e nas f\u00eameas, mas com exce\u00e7\u00e3o da\nprimavera, onde a alometr\u00eda foi positiva (b>3). O fator de condi\u00e7\u00e3o variou significativamente ao longo do ano em ambos os\nsexos.\n\nKey words: Skates, Depth, Total length, Elasmobranch, Sex ratio.\n\n*Universidade Estadual Paulista, Departamento de Ecologia, Campus Rio Claro Av. 24-A 1515, Caixa Postal 199, 13506-900 Rio Claro, SP,\n\nBrazil. mcoddone@rc.unesp.br\n\n**Instituto de Pesca, Av.

The\n\ngenus Rioraja Whitley, 1939, has a single species, the \u2018rio\n\nskate\u2019 Rioraja agassizi (M\u00fcller &amp; Henle, 1841), commonly\n\nknown in Brazil as \u2018raia-santa\u2019. The absence of a caudal fin is\n\na distinct character of this species (Figueiredo, 1977).\n\nFrom a biogeographic perspective, R. agassizi belongs to\n\nthe pattern of species endemic to the austral region of South\n\nAmerica, being, along with the genus Atlantoraja, limited to\n\n\n\nSize composition, monthly condition factor and morphometrics of Rioraja agassizi416\n\nthe south-western region of the Atlantic Ocean (McEachran\n\n&amp; Miyake, 1990; McEachran &amp; Aschliman, 2004; Compagno,\n\n2005). The species ranges from Esp\u00edrito Santo State (Brazil) to\n\nArgentina, inhabiting coastal waters from the shore down to\n\n130 m (Figueiredo, 1977).\n\nDespite the uniform-brown coloration, there are two darker\n\noval ocelli with a light or dark center, in the inner area of the\n\npectoral fins, being highly variable in shape and with a lighter\n\nring around them. In some individuals, this circle is surrounded\n\nby a single row of minute white points. Throughout the dorsal\n\nface of the skate, little, circular; white and symmetrically placed\n\nspots can occur, even in the pelvic fins area, in adult as well as\n\nyoung (Figueiredo, 1977; Barbosa &amp; Gomes, 1998; Oddone, pers.\n\nobs.). The white ventral surface with white and light pink tones\n\nallows it to be distinguished from young Atlantoraja platana\n\nwith which at first sight it could be mistaken. Light ventral\n\ncolouration in R. agassizi is typical of species that inhabit shal-\n\nlow waters (McEachran &amp; Notabartolo di Sciara, 1995).\n\nMale R. agassizi attains sexual maturity at 32 cm and fe-\n\nmales at 40 cm of total length (Oddone et al., 2007). Rioraja\n\nagassizi is a benthic feeder, preying mainly on Crustacea,\n\nespecially Amphipoda, Caridea and Brachyura and Teleostei\n\n(Muto et al., 2001).\n\nSkates, as other elasmobranches, are long-lived, attain\n\nsexual maturity at large size and have low fecundity and long\n\ndevelopment period. These features make them susceptible\n\nto overexploitation (Walker, 1999). Casarini (2006) estimated\n\nthe longevity of R. agassizi to be as 20 and 23 years respec-\n\ntively for males and females. It is important for management\n\npurposes to know where the center of the stock is and if it is\n\nsubject to seasonal variation (Walker, 1999). In Southeast\n\nBrazil, only the large individuals of R. agassizi are landed and\n\nexported (Casarini, 2006).\n\nThe aim of this work was to describe the latitudinal and\n\nbathymetric distribution of R. agassizi in the fishing area of\n\nSantos and Guaruj\u00e1\u2019s fishing fleet (southeast Brazil); to analyze\n\nthe frequency composition of total length for both sexes and\n\nthe relationships between total length and total width, and\n\ntotal and gutted weight; to establish the type of growth in\n\nweight with total length (allometry/isometry); and finally to\n\ndetermine the condition factor throughout a year.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nSamples of Rioraja agassizi were obtained through a part-\n\nnership system with fishermen as it is mostly a non commer-\n\ncialized species (Casarini, 1999). A total of eight fishing ves-\n\nsels (trawler and paired trawler), took part in the survey, bring-\n\ning regularly (once or twice a month) samples of this species.\n\nVessels\u2019 length over all ranged from 19.5 to 22.5 m and beam\n\nfrom 5.3 to 13 m m. The stretched mesh of the trawlnet varied\n\nfrom 45 to 90 mm and the groundrope ranged from 22 to 70 m.\n\nWhenever possible, skippers identified the sample bag\n\nwith a number corresponding with a trawling position, along\n\nwith it characteristics, recorded on a board map. Data col-\n\nlected for each trawl were: date, depth, latitude/longitude,\n\nnumber of hauls and number of hauls with occurrence of the\n\nspecies. As the presence/absence of the species per haul\n\nwas not regularly recorded, and since when recorded the in-\n\nformation was imprecise, it was assumed that such data is\n\nunknown.\n\nStudy area was located between latitudes 23\u00b037\u2019S and\n\n27\u00b040\u2019S, including States of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Paran\u00e1\n\nand Santa Catarina, at depths between 10 to 146 m (Fig. 1).\n\nSamples were collected monthly from March, 2005 to March,\n\n2006 (Table 1).\n\nBiometric measurements were: total length (TL, cm), total\n\nwidth (DW, cm), total weight (T\nW\n\n, g) and gutted weight (body\n\nweight without digestive tract, liver and gonads and oviduct\n\nfor the females, Gw, g).  Linear measurements were made with\n\n0.1 cm precision. Electronic scales used had 1 and 5 g preci-\n\nsion respectively.\n\nThe Condition Factor (CF) was calculated monthly ac-\n\ncording to King (1995): CF\nT\n=Tw/TLb and CF\n\nG\n=Gw/TLb, where\n\nthe sub-indexes T and G are the total and gutted weight,\n\nrespectively, b is the angular coefficient of the potential curve\n\nadjusted to the relationship  TL-Tw and TL-Gw.\n\nThe use of parametric/non-parametric tests was chosen\n\nby testing the normality and homogeneity of the variables\u2019\n\nvariance by Lilliefors\u2019 and Levene\u2019s tests respectively. To\n\ncompare TL-Tw/Gw curves, data were log-transformed to\n\nbecome linear and the F-test was used (Souza, 1998). Sex\n\nratios were tested using 2. To assess the nature of the growth\n\nin weight with TL (isometry, allometry, etc.), the value of the\n\nangular coefficient b was compared with the theoretical value\n\nof 3. For this purpose, monthly samples of males and females\n\nwere grouped by season, that is, summer (January, February,\n\nMarch), autumn (April, May, June), winter (July, August, Sep-\n\ntember) and spring (October, November, December). Compari-\n\nsons among CF obtained for all individuals by month, were\n\nperformed using Kruskal-Wallis\u2019 H-test and post-hoc Mann-\n\nFig. 1.

Females were signifi-\n\ncantly larger than males (t=-28.5; d. f. =1295; p<0), and such\n\npattern was maintained monthly. The difference in mean TL\n\nfor males and females in presented in Table 2. For grouped TL\n\ndistributions, asymmetry patterns were observed in both\n\nsexes, with asymmetry values different from 0 (Table 2), vary-\n\ning from \u20131.8 to \u20131.3 for males and females, respectively (Fig.\n\n3). The asymmetry pattern remained when monthly samples\n\nwere considered, though varying between positive and nega-\n\ntive values. In the males, positive asymmetry was observed in\n\nMay, June, October, November, December and March of 2006,\n\nwhereas only in December for females. Mean TL varied between\n\n43.4 (February) and 53.0 (October) for the females and between\n\n36.7 (March) and 41.2 (May) for the males (Table 2).\n\nTotal length/TW functions for R. agassizi were\n\nsignificantly different for both sexes (F\n(2,1291)\n\n=75.2; p<0.005)\n\n(Table 3). Males were wider than females for TL&lt;24.5 cm\n\n(TW=17.4 cm). From that size up, females become wider than\n\nmales for all TL classes (Fig. 4). Total length-Tw potential\n\ncurves were significantly different than TL-Gw curves (Table\n\n3, Fig. 5) in females (F\n(2,1002)\n\n=53.6; p=0.000) and males\n\n(F\n(2,533)\n\n=80.3; p=0.000).  Females were heavier than males for a\n\ngiven TL class, considering both Tw and Gw (F\n(2,1279)\n\n=75.2;\n\np=0.000; F\n(2,1132)\n\n=580; p=0.000, respectively). In Table 4, mean\n\nvalues for Tw and Gw by month and sex along with the\n\nrespective TL range are presented.\n\nMales grew in weight in a negative allometric manner with\n\nTL (b<3), when considering Tw as well as Gw, in the four\n\nseasons. The females, however, followed the same pattern of\n\nnegative allometry, with exception of spring when their growth\n\nwas positively allometric (b>3) (Table 5).\n\nFor the males, July was not included in the calculation of\n\nCF when considering Tw, and when considering Gw, June\n\nand July were not considered, because in those months the\n\nsmall sample led to outlier values for the angular coefficient\n\nb. This was due to the fact that only males with large TL\n\nvalues occurred, and because of the absence of juveniles in\n\nthe samples, the potential curve was not properly adjusted.\n\nKruskal-Wallis\u2019 test detected significant differences in the\n\nCF throughout the year, when considering Tw (H\n(11, N= 277)\n\n=267.66, p=0.0000)) and Gw (H\n(10, N=260)\n\n=245.3, p=0.0000). The\n\noverall median CF\u2019s value for Tw was 0.028.

C. Oddone, A. F. de Amorim, P. L. Mancini &amp; W. Norbis 421\n\nDiscussion\n\nInformation on habitat use in elasmobranchs is important\n\nnot only with specific objectives such as determination of\n\nnursery area, but also for management purposes and species\n\nconservation. During the past decade, studies on habitat use\n\nhave increased specially for commercially fished species and\n\nextracted by-catch, as is the case for the rajids (Simpfendorfer\n\n&amp; Heupel, 2004).\n\nFisheries have negatively affected rajid fishes, in part be-\n\ncause of their mostly sedentary nature even to the point of ex-\n\ntinction, rendering many species in a critical situation (Brander,\n\n1981; Casey &amp; Myers, 1998; Dulvy &amp; Reynolds, 2002).\n\nFor fishery-dependent samples, it is not possible to obtain\n\na reliable estimation of CPUE because we have only access to\n\na \u2018fleeting image\u2019 of the real population (Walker, 1999), which\n\nis especially true for this work. This is due to the contradic-\n\ntory and low quality and reliability of the information pro-\n\nvided by the skippers regarding the magnitude of total catch\n\nand discard. However, because of the monthly presence of R.\n\nagassizi in the samples, it is assumed that it is present in the\n\narea throughout the year without variation in its abundance.\n\nReinforcing this hypothesis, Ponz Louro (1995) observed that\n\nafter Psammobatis glandissimilis, R. agassizi is the most abun-\n\ndant rajid in Ubatuba, S\u00e3o Paulo State, and Figueiredo (1977)\n\nhad already considered the species as \u2018common\u2019 in the same\n\narea.  For the Uruguayan inner shelf, R. agassizi together with\n\nAtlantoraja castelanui and A. cyclophora were distributed in\n\n30-60% of the area with abundances between 1000 and 5000 kg/\n\nsquare nautical mile (Paesch, 2006).\n\nMost skate species have a limited, well-defined distribu-\n\ntion, and there are very few ranging species (Walker, 1999). It\n\nis known that R. agassizi ranges from Argentina to Rio de\n\nJaneiro (Brazil) (Figueiredo, 1977). Though precise limits of\n\nits distribution remain unknown to date, R. agassizi is prob-\n\nably distributed continuously along the cited range, because\n\nit is recorded in southeast and south Brazil, Uruguay and\n\nArgentina (Figueiredo, 1977; Menni &amp; Lopez, 1984; Vooren,\n\n1998; Meneses &amp; Paesch, 2003).\n\nWith regard to depth of occurrence, Menni &amp; Lopez (1984)\n\nclassified R. agassizi as belonging to the \u2018inner shelf mixed\n\nfauna\u2019 fish group (Menni &amp; Gosztonyi, 1982). McEachran &amp;\n\nMiyake (1990) stated that R. agassizi occurred at depths down\n\nto ~50 m. However, in this study, R. agassizi was recorded at\n\nmaximum depths of 120 m and Menni &amp; Lopez (1984) stated\n\nits depth range was from 22 to 89 m. For the south Brazilian\n\narea, Vooren (1998) confirmed its presence at depth of 20-50\n\nm, in agreement with Compagno (2005) who considers this\n\nspecies as demersal in the shelf of it distribution range. For\n\nVooren op.cit., R. agassizi is a species of constant presence\n\nin south Brazil, which completes it cycle  entirely in these\n\nwaters without seasonal variations in its abundance, being\n\none of the 27 elasmobranch species recorded in the South\n\nBrazilian shelf (Vooren &amp; Klippel., 2005). Menni et al. (1981)\n\nrecorded the southernmost limit for this species in the Golfo\n\nde San Mat\u00edas (Argentina, at 41\u00b030\u2019), where it is fished at up\n\nto 181 m deep, while Figueiredo (1977) considered that the\n\nspecies occurred at a maximum depth of 130 m in southwest\n\nBrazil. In Ubatuba, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s State\u2019s littoral area, R. agassizi\n\noccurs only in the coastal area at down to 50 m, with similar\n\nproportions of males and females during the whole year (Ponz\n\nLouro, 1995). Casarini (2006) observed that R. agassizi was\n\nthe most abundant species in the depth range of 10-50 m in\n\nsoutheast Brazil.\n\nSexual segregation was not observed in this work and sex\n\nratio favored the females. The same was observed by Casarini\n\n(2006) for the same species in the same area. However, uni-\n\nsexual aggregations of Raja clavata were recorded off the\n\ncoast of East Anglia by Holden (1975), and could be common\n\nfor rajids (Steven, 1933). For the southwestern Atlantic,\n\nSympterygia acuta, S. bonapartii and Atlantoraja\n\ncyclophora do not segregate by sexes (De Queiroz, 1986;\n\nOddone &amp; Vooren, 2004, 2005). Ebert (2005) studied eight\n\nBathyraja species, recording no sexual segregation in six of\n\nthem and a sex ratio favoring males in only two, along the\n\neastern Bering Sea continental slope.\n\nData on the distribution of sizes in the catch can indi-\n\ncates a population\u2019s status or the risk of overfishing, as too\n\nFig. 5.

The same authors stated that young\n\nfish are less vulnerable to fishing gears than older ones. How-\n\never, Oddone (unpublished data) recorded the presence of\n\nyoung and even neonates of R. agassizi and Atlantoraja\n\nspp., a fact that to date seemed to be unusual in rajids and\n\nthat reflects the vulnerability of these life stages to bottom\n\ntrawl fisheries. For the South Brazilian shelf Vooren &amp; Klippel\n\n(2005) did not record neonates of R. agassizi, at depths of 7-\n\n20 m. Patterns of negative asymmetry in TL distributions,\n\nindicate that both for males and females, more specimens\n\noccurred with high values of TL and a few with low values of\n\nTL. A positive pattern of asymmetry would indicate just the\n\nopposite.\n\nNegative asymmetric distribution of frequencies of TL for\n\nboth sexes were observed in Atlantoraja cyclophora (Oddone\n\n&amp; Vooren, 2004).\n\nThe largest specimen of R. agassizi recorded by Figuei-\n\nredo (1977) was a 49 cm  adult male. In this work the largest\n\nsizes observed were 59.4 cm for the females and 47.2 cm for\n\nthe males, confirming the sexual dimorphism in size. In sharks,\n\nfemales attain maximum size and older age than males (Cort\u00e9s,\n\n2000). Several Rajidae are sexually dimorphic too, regarding\n\nsize (Jardas, 1973; Nottage &amp; Perkins, 1983; Oddone &amp; Vooren,\n\n2004). Exceptionally, Ebert (2005) observed that in Bathyraja\n\ninterrupta, B. minispinosa and B. parmifera, males attained\n\na larger size than females, while in B. lindbergi, B. maculata\n\nand B. trachura  both sexes grew to approximately the same\n\nsize, observing that only in B. aleutica and B. taranetzi did\n\nfemales achieve noticeably larger sizes than males. Cousseau\n\net al. (2000) in Argentinean waters recorded contrasting maxi-\n\nmum TLs of 61.8 cm for a male and 70.8 cm for a female of R.\n\nagassizi. This suggests a size gradient in the TL for R. agassizi,\n\nwhich increases southward, and which was already noted in\n\nteleost fishes (Wootton, 1996).\n\nSexually dimorphic length-weight relationships, were\n\nobserved in A. cyclophora (total and gutted weight),\n\nPsammobatis normani, P. extenta and S. bonapartii (Braccini\n\n&amp; Chiaramonte, 2002; Mabraga\u00f1a et al., 2002; Oddone &amp;\n\nVooren, 2004; Mabraga\u00f1a &amp; Cousseau, 2004), though Raja\n\nmiraletus showed an opposite pattern (Ungaro, 2004). In this\n\nwork, it was observed that throughout the year, males and\n\nfemales grew with negative allometry with TL, with exception\n\nof spring when females followed a pattern of positive allom-\n\netry. This could be due more to food availability in spring in\n\nthe area than to reproduction, as in this species vitellogen-\n\nesis, ovulation and egg-laying occur throughout the year\n\n(Oddone et al., 2007). Possible effect of stomach contents on\n\nthe weight of the skates were avoided by calculating b with\n\ngutted weight, so differences in body weight may well reflect\n\ndifferences in body condition.\n\nThe correlation coefficient of the ratio TL-Gw was par-\n\nticularly lower in the males (0.767). This would indicate that,\n\nin spite of the fact that such correlation was significant for\n\nthe potential curve adjusted, a trend in the Gw to increase\n\nmore slowly with total length exists, when compared with Tw,\n\nfor a given TL value. This fact was not evident in the females\n\nand could then be related to the sexual dimorphism in the\n\nbody shape that is observed in rajid species, i.e., males present\n\na striking concavity in the anterior part of the disc, from the\n\nsnout to the tip of the pectoral fins, which is not observed in\n\nthe females. When considering Tw, such trend is likewise\n\nmasked by the effect of the viscera and especially stomach\n\ncontent, reflecting a more typical potential curve pattern be-\n\ncause of the higher value of the angular coefficient b.\n\nIn summer, b was estimated to be 2.984 and 2.888 for total\n\nand gutted weight respectively. Although these values were\n\nstatistically different from 3, the sample number (71) may be\n\nconsidered, because the larger the sample size, the more the\n\nsignificance of the differences, and therefore for this season\n\ngrowth could have been isometric as well. Braccini &amp;\n\nChiaramonte (2002) recorded isometric growth for males and\n\npositive allometric growth in females of P. extenta.\n\nThe condition factor can provide information on the gen-\n\neral condition of fishes in the habitat they live, as well as\n\nindicate phenomena such as spawning period, alterations in\n\npopulation density and feeding conditions (Braga, 1986). In\n\nR. agassizi, CF varied significantly throughout the year, re-\n\nflecting variations in the availability of food and mainly in the\n\nFig. 6. Median condition factor by month (from March, 2005\n\nto March, 2006) considering total (black line) and gutted weight\n\n(g) (grey line) for males (above) and females (below) of Rioraja\n\nagassizi.

C. Oddone, A. F. de Amorim, P. L. Mancini &amp; W. Norbis 423\n\nreproductive events, such as egg-laying, vitellogenesis and\n\nproduction of the egg cases.  Seasonal variation of the diet\n\nseems to be associated with the availability of the prey, whose\n\ndistribution and abundance are related to the dynamics of\n\nthe water masses of the region (Muto et al., 2001). Loefer &amp;\n\nSedberry (2003) observed that in Rhizoprionodon\n\nterraenovae the condition factor in both sexes was low dur-\n\ning the mating season, an indication of probable stress.\n\nThe CF may also be influenced by the liver weight\u2019s varia-\n\ntion throughout the year, as the liver is strongly correlated\n\nwith reproduction in rajids (Oddone &amp; Velasco, 2006) and elas-\n\nmobranchs in general. Sexual dimorphism in the liver weight\n\nwas noted already in several rajid species, and this is related to\n\nthe energy expenditure of females during vitellogenesis, oo-\n\ncyte maturation and gestation. Females store great quantities\n\nof lipids in the liver during the pre-vitellogenic phase of the\n\nreproductive cycle (Lucifora et al., 2002), and the production\n\nof vitellogenin (the precursor to egg yolk proteins), takes place\n\nin the liver (Gelsleichter, 2004). In Raja asterias, for instance,\n\nan increase in the gonad weight is accompanied by the storage\n\nof substances in the liver (Capap\u00e9, 1980). In males of this spe-\n\ncies, two well defined annual peaks in the gonadosomatic in-\n\ndex exist, while in the females of R. agassizi and others such as\n\nA. cyclophora (Oddone &amp; Vooren, 2005), such peaks are not\n\nthat evident, confirming the absence of seasonality in the re-\n\nproductive variables, such as gonad weight, egg-laying fre-\n\nquency throughout the year, etc. This observation may well\n\nexplain the rather greater variation for males in the CF (with\n\nregard to Gw), by the end of the year (December) when com-\n\npared with females.\n\nA growth pattern where males are wider than females in the\n\nfirst life stages, turning the females wider than males from a given\n\nTL, may be typical of at least some rajids and was also observed in\n\nA. cyclophora (Oddone, 2003; Oddone &amp; Vooren, 2004).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSkippers Gonzalez Ant\u00f4nio do Nascimento &amp; Pedro Silva\n\n(Cigano do Mar II &amp; III); Airton Faria &amp; Jos\u00e9 dos Santos (An-\n\ntares I &amp; Polares III); Antonio de Oliveira Neto (Franzese III);\n\nOs\u00e9ias Vicente (S\u00e3o Paulo IV); Waldecir da Silva (S\u00e3o Paulo II);\n\nEdgar Nascimento dos Santos (Dourado &amp; Araguaia); Gonzalez\n\nAntonio do Nascimento (S\u00e3o Paulo VI &amp; XI) and Jorge da Silva\n\n(Jangadeiro XV).
