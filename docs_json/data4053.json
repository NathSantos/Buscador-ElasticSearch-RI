A wide range of chemical structures can be found among these compounds. Hence, it is reasonable to expect diverse properties and physiological functions for different groups of biosurfactants. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to prepare mixtures of biosurfactants produced by different microorganisms, in order to evaluate their main characteristics (surface tension, emulsification ability, antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities) for several applications, namely in the oil recovery, health care and biomedical fields.\nInitial screening revealed that biosurfactants from Lactobacillus agi/is CCUG31450, Bacillus subtiiis PX573 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PX112 possessed the most notable activity. Therefore, strategies to improve biosurfactants yield and reduce production costs were conducted. The B. subti/isPX573 and P. aeruginosa PX112 biosurfactants yields increased 2.8 and 2.5 times, respectively; due to the optimization of the agitation and use of low-cost substrates. Moreover, the development of an efficient downstream process led to an additionally increase of the amount of\nP.\taeruginosa PX112 biosurfactants recovered. The evaluation of biosurfactants stability at extreme environmental conditions was performed. The results showed that biosurfactants were very stable, suggesting their application in bioremediation and in the oil industry. The antimicrobial, antiadhesive and oil recovery activity of the produced biosurfactants were evaluated, first individually and then within different mixtures. In the antimicrobial assays, individual biosurfactants from B. subtiiisPX573 and P. aeruginosa PX112 showed the most interesting results, mainly against Grampositive bacteria. However, it was with the mixture of biosurfactants from lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus paracasei A20 and Lactobacillus anima/is ATCC35046 that the most remarkable synergetic effect was observed. In the case of the anti-adhesive assays, the probiotic biosurfactants from L. agi/is CCUG31450 were the most effective and the mixture P. aeruginosa PX112 (CSLM) and L. agi/isCCUG31450 (MRS) biosurfactants showed the most positive interaction. At last, from the oil recovery assays it was found that biosurfactants from B. subtiiis PX573 and P. aeruginosa PX112 were equally or even a more effective than the chemical surfactants tested.\nIn conclusion, each mixture tested in the different assays showed a unique activity that was dependent on the type of biosurfactant, the proportion of the mixture and the pathogenic strain studied. In some cases, an interesting synergetic effect between different biosurfactants was achieved that consequently enhanced their activity in the diverse applications tested.\nv\nSUM\u00c1RIO\nOs biosurfactantes s\u00e3o mol\u00e9culas produzidas por uma variedade de microrganismos que exibem uma interessante atividade de superf\u00edcie e emulsionante. Estes compostos podem apresentar uma grande variedade de estruturas qu\u00edmicas. Assim, \u00e9 aceit\u00e1vel esperar que os diferentes grupos de biosurfactantes possam apresentar diversas propriedades e fun\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas. Deste modo, esta tese teve como objetivo a prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de misturas de biosurfactantes produzidos por diferentes microrganismos, de forma a avaliar as suas principais caracter\u00edsticas (tens\u00e3o superficial, capacidade de emulsifica\u00e7\u00e3o, atividades antimicrobiana e anti-adesiva) e testar a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o nas \u00e1reas de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do petr\u00f3leo, sa\u00fade e biom\u00e9dica.\nUma an\u00e1lise inicial revelou que os biosurfactantes produzidos por Lactobacillus agi/is CCUG31450, Bacillus subti/is PX573 e Pseudomonas aeruginosa PX112 apresentavam uma atividade mais not\u00e1vel. Assim, foram aplicadas estrat\u00e9gias para promover o aumento da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biosurfactantes e a redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos respetivos custos. O rendimento dos biosurfactantes de B subti/is PX573 e P aeruginosa PX112 aumentou 2.8 e 2.5 vezes respetivamente, devido a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da agita\u00e7\u00e3o e do uso de substratos de baixo custo. Al\u00e9m disso, o desenvolvimento de um processo eficiente de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o levou a um aumento adicional dos biosurfactantes de P. aeruginosa PX112 recuperados. Foi realizada a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da estabilidade dos biosurfactants em condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais extremas. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que os biosurfactantes eram bastante est\u00e1veis, sugerindo a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o na biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o e na ind\u00fastria petrol\u00edfera. Foi, de igual modo, avaliada a atividade antimicrobiana, anti-adesiva e de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo, primeiro individualmente e depois com diferentes misturas de biosurfactantes. Nos testes antimicrobianos os biosurfactantes individuais produzidos por B. subtilis PX573 e P. aeruginosa PX112 revelaram os resultados mais interessantes, principalmente contras as bact\u00e9rias Gram-positivas. Contudo, foi na mistura preparada com biosurfactantes das bact\u00e9rias l\u00e1cticas Lactobaciiius paracasei A20 e Lactobacillus anima/is ATCC35046 que se observou o efeito sinerg\u00e9tico mais not\u00e1vel. No caso dos ensaios anti-adesivos, os biosurfactantes probi\u00f3ticos de L. agi/is CCUG31450 foram os mais efetivos e a mistura com biosurfactantes de P aeruginosa PX112 (CSLM) e L agi/isCCUG31450 (MRS) revelou a intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre biosurfactantes mais positiva. Por fim, nos ensaios de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo verificou-se que os biosurfactantes de B subti/is PX573 e P aeruginosa PX112 eram igualmente ou at\u00e9 mesmo mais efetivos do que os surfactantes qu\u00edmicos testados.\nEm conclus\u00e3o, cada mistura testada nos deferentes ensaios revelou uma atividade \u00fanica que era dependente do tipo de biosurfactante, da sua propor\u00e7\u00e3o na mistura e da estirpe patog\u00e9nica testada. Em alguns casos, foi observado um efeito sinerg\u00e9tico entre os biosurfactantes misturados, levando consequentemente um aumento da sua atividade nas diversas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es testadas.\nvii\nTable of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables and List of Abbreviations\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAGRADECIMENTOS\tiii\nABSTRACT\tv\nSUM\u00c1RIO\tvii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\txiii\nLIST OF TABLES\txvii\nLIST OF FIGURES\txxi\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS\txxv\nCONTEXT AND MOTIVATION\txxvii\nREASERCH AND AIMS:\txxvii\n1.

These remarkable characteristics have led biosurfactants to be an asset in a wide range of potential applications, such as therapeutics, biomedical, enhanced oil recovery and food processing. In spite of the immense potential of biosurfactants, their use and production at an industrial scale still remains limited, mainly due to their high production and extraction costs, low production yields and lack of information on their toxicity towards human systems.\nIn order to overcome this problem, making biosurfactant production economically feasible, a number of strategies have been well explored, for instance the use of cheaper substrates, optimal growth and production conditions coupled with novel and efficient multistep downstream processing methods, and the use of recombinant and mutant hyper producing microbial strains. Another alternative, not yet explored, is the use of biosurfactant \u201ccocktails\u201d with different microbial origins to enhance a given feature for a particular application. Since biosurfactants can show a wide range of chemical structures, it is predicted that their positive interaction could enhance their properties.\nIn summary, the combination of these strategies will help to overcome the economic barriers of biosurfactants production and at the same time to improve their properties and make them more attractive for industrial applications.\nREASERCH AND AIMS:\nThe main goal of this work was the preparation of mixtures of biosurfactants produced by different microorganisms to study their main characteristics towards different applications. In this sense, the secondary aims were the following:\nxxvii\n\u2022\tOptimization of biosurfactants yields and reduction of production costs using low-cost substrates;\n\u2022\tCharacterization of biosurfactants, namely their physicochemical and biological properties;\n\u2022\tPreparation of mixtures of biosurfactants synthetized by different bacteria;\n\u2022\tValidation of biosurfactants mixtures activities in diverse applications, namely as antiadhesion and antimicrobial agents, and their capacity to recover oil envisaging their potential application in MEOR.\nxxviii\n1.\tINTRODUCTION\nOver the years biosurfactants have been studied and characterized in order to assess their activity and understand their biological role and value.\n1.1.\tMicrobial surface-active compounds\nSeveral microorganisms produce molecules with surface activity, designated biosurfactants [1], which are mostly either anionic or non-ionic [2]. These molecules can be cell-bound or excreted by the microorganisms. Structurally, biosurfactants are amphipihilic molecules, i.e. consist of a hydrophilic (polar) moiety that can be an amino acid, carbohydrate, cyclic peptide or phosphate; and a hydrophobic (nonpolar) moiety composed of unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon chains or fatty acids. Based on their structure the biosurfactants are able to accumulate between fluid phases such as oil/water or air/water, lower the surface and interfacial tension of liquids, and form micelles and microemulsions between two different phases [1-3]. The biosurfactants have unique properties, such as biodegradability, low toxicity and stability in adverse conditions, that confers to these molecules several advantages as compared to the chemical surfactants [2]. Additionally, due to their characteristics and natural roles these molecules have gained importance in diverse applications. Depending on their chemical composition and properties, biosurfactants could be more suitable for one or other application.\n1.1.1.\tClassification of biosurfactants\nGenerally, biosurfactants are classified according to their chemical composition or microbial origin [3]. Rosenberg and Ron [4] proposed that microbial surface active compounds can be divided into low-molecular-weight molecules, the so-called biosurfactants that reduce surface and interfacial tension more efficiently; and high-molecular-weight polymers, named as bioemulsifiers that possess powerful emulsion-stabilizing activity.\nThe most common biosurfactants include glycolipids, lipopeptides and phospholipids, while the bioemulsifiers include polymeric and particulate compounds [5]. Table 1 summarizes the different classes of biosurfactants and their producers.\n3\nTable 1. Types of biosurfactants and their producers. (Adapted from [2-4, 6]).\nBiosurfactant class\tProducing microorganism\nGlycolipids Rhamnolipids Sophorolipids\tPseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas chororaphis Candida bombicoia, Candida ap\u00edcola, Candida antarctica, Toruiopis petrophiium\nMannosylerythritol lipids (MEL) Trehalose lipids\tC antarctica, Pseudozyma aphidis, Pseudozyma ruguiosa Norcadia erithropoll's, Rhodococcus erythropoiis, Arthobacter sp.\nLipopeptides Surfactin Iturin/fengycin Lichenysin\tBacillus subtiiis B. subtiiis Bacillus iicheniformis\nPhospolipids Fatty acids/ neutral lipids\tAcinetobacter sp, Corynebacterium iepus Corynebacterium insidibasseosum, Candida ingens, Rhodotoruia giutinis\nPolymeric surfactants Emulsan Liposan Alasan\tAcinetobacter caicoaceticus Candida iipoiytica A. caicoaceticus\nParticulate biosurfactants Surlactin\tA. caicoaceticus, Cyanobacteria Lactobacillus\n1.1.2.\tBiosurfactants properties\nBiosurfactants have aroused interest to several applications due to their properties such as surface, interfacial and emulsion activity, as well as stability to extreme environmental conditions (temperature, pH and salinity). As previously mentioned, biosurfactants show remarkable properties as biological molecules that are advantageous comparing to their chemical counterparts, namely biodegradability and low toxicity [2, 5, 7]. These properties are described in detail in the following sections.\ni.\tSurface and interfacial tension\n4\nproduced by P aeruginosa strains decreased the surface tension of water from 72 mN/m to 30 mN/m and the interfacial tension of water/hexadecane to values lower than 1 mN/m [9]. The biosurfactants produced by B. subti/isstrains, namely surfactin, can reduce the surface tension of water to 25 mN/m and interfacial tension of water/hexadencane to values below 1 mN/m [10]. Moreover, a reduction of surface tension to 33 mN/m and interfacial tension to 5 mN/m were reported by Cooper and Paddock [11] for sophorolipids from Toruiopsis bombicoia.\nIn general, these studies showed that biosurfactants are more effective and efficient than chemical surfactants, with critical micelle concentrations (CMC) about 10 to 40 times lower, i.e. lower amounts of biosurfactants are required to achieve a maximal decrease of the surface tension [5].\nii.\tEmulsifying activity\nAn emulsion is defined as an heterogeneous system, comprising at least one immiscible liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets [5]. These types of systems possess a minimal stability, which may be enhanced by the addiction of surface active compounds. In general, the bioemulsifiers are better emulsifiers than the biosurfactants. As an example, it was found that sophorolipids from T. bombicoia show a good surface and interfacial tension, however did not revealed good emulsifying activity [2]. On the contrary, the bioemulsifier liposan from C. Upoiytica could not reduce the surface tension but showed a good emulsifying activity, being successfully used to emulsify edible oils [2]. The emulsifying activity of these microbial surface active molecules is especially interesting in the food industry, but also for environmental applications [12].\niii.\tStability to different environmental conditions\nThe stability of biosurfactants to extreme conditions of pH, temperature and salinity make them desirable molecules for applications where these conditions prevail. Several studies showed that many biosurfactants are not affected by extreme environmental conditions. The lichenysin produced by B. iicheniformis JF-2 is an example of a biosurfactant with good stability, not being affected by temperature up to 50oC, pH 4.5 - 9.0, and by NaCI concentrations up to 50 g/l [13]. A thermostable (30 - 100oC) and pH (2.0 - 12.0) stable biosurfactant produced by Arthrobacter protophormiae was described by Pruthi and Cameotra [14]. Nitschke and Pastore [15], studied\n5\nthe stability of a lipopeptide produced by B. subti/isLB5a. The surface activity did not change within the pH range from 4 to 11, and NaCl concentrations up to 20 %. The lipopeptide was stable after autoclaving (121 oC, 20 min), and even at low temperatures (-18oC) the biosurfactant maintained its activity.\nSome industrial processes require the use of new microbial compounds that can resist to these extreme conditions. As such, biosurfactants could be considered for such applications [5].\niv.\tBiodegradability\nOne of the most attractive properties of the biosurfactants compared with the chemical ones is their biodegradability [16], which make them useful for environmental applications such as bioremediation [8, 17]. Lima et al. [18] evaluated the biosurfactants biodegradability as compared to sodium dodecyl sulfate. The authors concluded that the biosurfactants tested were more suitable for bioremediation applications due to their biodegradability and impact in the environment.\nThe increasing environmental concerns, as well as the regulatory obligations imposed by governments, make the biosurfactants interesting alternatives to replace chemical surfactants [5].\nv.\tLow toxicity\nAlthough the toxicity of biosurfactants has not been widely explored, in general they are classified as low or non- toxic molecules, thus being considered appropriate for pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic uses [2]. For instance, the synthetic anionic surfactant, Corexit was found to have a ten times lower LC50 (lethal concentration to 50 % of test species) against Photobacterium phosphoreum than the rhamnolipids tested, proving the higher toxicity of the chemical surfactant. Similarly, Marlon A-350, a chemical surfactant commonly used in industry, showed higher toxicity and mutagenic activity when compared with biosurfactants produced by P aeruginosa [19].\n6\n1.1.3.\tNatural roles\nA wide range of microorganisms have been shown to produce surface active agents as a strategy to survive in the environment. These agents can increase the bioavailability of waterinsoluble substrates, provide the uptake of key metal ions necessary as co-factors for enzymes, exhibit antimicrobial activity in order to inhibit the growth of other microorganisms, and are involved in the interaction of microorganisms with surfaces.\nBiosurfactants are responsible for increasing the bioavailability of hydrophobic waterinsoluble substrates. For instance, microorganisms living in environments rich in hydrophobic substrates with low solubility in water, such as hydrocarbons, have some limitations to obtain the essential nutrients for their metabolism. Due to the hydrophobic character of these substrates, they adsorb to surfaces, thus restricting their bioavailability. Therefore, these microorganisms produce biosurfactants that can either be excreted to the surrounding environment or remain attached to the cell membrane. The biosurfactants are then predominantly produced during growth on water immiscible substrates, in order to desorb the substrate that is adsorbed on the surfaces or to increase their apparent solubility [7]. Specifically, biosurfactants due to their ability to reduce the interfacial tension are particularly effective in making the bound substrates available for biodegradation. Moreover, the ones with low CMC are capable of incorporating the hydrocarbons in the hydrophobic cavity of their micelles, increasing therefore the substrate solubility in water (Figure 1). As an example, the rhamnolipids produced by P. aeruginosa strains, have been involved in the degradation of polymeric hydrocarbons. Other authors, showed that rhamnolipids besides emulsifying alkanes, also stimulate the growth of P aeruginosa strains in hexadecane [3]. Some authors isolated two mutants of P aeruginosa, PU-1 and PU-2, that were unable to produce rhamnolipids and also could not grow adequately on alkanes, proving therefore the importance of biosurfactants in the cell growth on hydrophobic substrates [3]. In the same way, biosurfactantnegative mutants of P aeruginosa KY-4025 and P aeruginosa PG-201 [20] showed poor growth on n-paraffin and hexadecane, respectively, as compared to wild type strains. This study clearly demonstrates that the addiction of rhamnolipids enables restoring the microbial growth on the hydrophobic substrates [3].\n7\nFigure 1. Incorporation of hydrophobic substrates in the hydrophobic cavity of biosurfactants micelles.\nThe uptake of metal ions, required for the metabolism of microorganisms, can be stimulated by biosurfactants. Some metal ions are important co-factors in the microbial metabolism, therefore microorganisms produce biosurfactants that form a complex with the metal ion and interact with the cell surface prompting their uptake. Herman et al. [21] found that rhamnolipids are capable of removing cadmium, lead and zinc from soil. Moreover, bioemulsifiers have also been described to interact with metal ions by binding them, it is the case of emulsan produced by A. ca/coaceticus that binds to uranium [22].\nThe potential of biosurfactants as antibiotics confers the producing-microorganisms advantages to compete with other microorganisms present in the same environment. For example, biosurfactants have been described to show antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi and viruses [5].\nThe microorganism\u2019s ability to place themselves in an ecological niche, in which they can multiply, is one of their survival strategies. Biosurfactants play a crucial role in this strategy, since they are responsible for the interaction of the microorganism with a specific surface. In the case of biosurfactants that are excreted, they can form a conditioning film on the interface, thereby stimulating certain microorganisms to attach to a surface while inhibiting the attachment of others. On the other hand, cell-bound biosurfactants lead to the modification of the cell surface hydrophobicity [4]. For instance, Acinetobacter strains that produce cell-bound biosurfactants showed a reduction of their hydrophobicity due to biosurfactants [23]. In sum, biosurfactants have been shown to be involved in cell adherence, which imparts a great stability under hostile environmental conditions and virulence; and in cell desorption when organisms need to find new habitats for survival [7].\n8\nSome biosurfactants have been reported as being produced by microorganisms in association with virulence factors. For instance, Van Delden and Iglewski [24] suggested that rhamnolipids can be associated to virulence factors in P aeruginosa strains that are involved in opportunistic infections. Olvera et al. [25] found that the synthesis of rhamnolipids in P aeruginosa strains is mediated by the same proteins that are associated to other virulence-factors, such as alginate and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). For that reason, the evaluation of rhamnolipids for biomedical and therapeutic applications should take into account this aspect.\n1.2.\tAnalytical methods to study biosurfactants\nThe advances in the discovery of biosurfactants were largely attributed to the development of rapid and reliable methods for the screening and selection of biosurfactants producingmicroorganisms, as well as for the evaluation of the biosurfactants properties. Table 2 describes the main analytic methods used to study biosurfactants.\nTable 2. Analytic methods used to screen biosurfactant producers and to evaluate biosurfactants activity.\nMethod\tDescription\tRef.\nBlood agar screening method\tBased on the hemolytic activity of biosurfactants. This method is widely used for screening biosurfactants producing-strains. Briefly, each strain is streaked onto blood agar plates and incubated during 24h at 37oC. The visualization of clear zones around the colonies indicates the presence of biosurfactants. The diameter of the clear zones is a qualitative method used as an indicator of biosurfactant production. This assay does not detect specific types of biosurfactants.\t[26, 27,28]\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tEvaluates the presence of biosurfactant in the broth supernatant, based on their surface activity. A drop of cell suspension is placed on an oil-\t\nDrop-collapsing test\tcoated-surface; if the drop collapses it indicates the presence of surfactant (a positive result); if the drop remains stable, indicates the absence of surfactant (a negative response). The assay is fast, easy to perform, reproducible and does not require specialized equipment.\t[3, 29]\nThe surface tension of a solution containing biosurfactants is measured by a ring-tensiometer. Willumsen and Karlson defined a good biosurfactant producer as the one being able to reduce the surface tension of the growth medium by >20 mN/m as compared to distilled\t[30]\nwater.\nTensiometric measurements\n9\nTable 2. Analytic methods for a quick detection of biosurfactants producing-strains and evaluation of biosurfactants activity (continuation).\nMethod\nDescription\nRef.\nThe estimation of emulsification index value is performed by vigorously shaking the culture broth samples with an equal volume of kerosene or nhexadecane. After 24h, the value of E24 is given by the equation:\n10\nEmulsification index value (E24)\nE24(%) =\nHeight of the emulsion layer\nTotal height\nx 100\n[31, 32,\n33]\nCritical micelle concentration (CMC)\nHydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)\nThis method is suitable to determine the activity of emulsifying biosurfactants.\nThe CMC is defined as the concentration above which micelles are formed. Briefly, the surface tension of different biosurfactant concentrations is measured. Once the CMC value is reached, the [3, 34,35] surface tension will remain constant. The determination of CMC is\ncommonly used to measure the efficiency of the biosurfactants.\nThe HLB value indicates the biosurfactant emulsifying activity. The HLB value indicates whether a surfactant will promote water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion. The HLB scale can be constructed by assigning a value of 1 to oleic acid, and a value of 20 to sodium oleate. Emulsifiers with HLB values less than 6 will favor the stabilization of water-in-oil emulsions, whereas emulsifiers with HLB values between 10 and 18 have the opposite effect and will favor oil-in-water emulsions. These values can be calculated by measuring the contact angles.\n[3, 28]\nThis simple test allows the determination, in bacterial culture broth, of\nColorimetric methods-\nthe presence of anionic biosurfactants. Briefly, anionic biosurfactants\nCTAB\ncan form a colored complex with the cationic surfactant CTAB and the\n(ceyitrimethylammonium\nbasic dye methylene blue. This complex can be quantified by\nbromide)\nspectrophotometry.\n[27,36, 37]\nIn general, the methods above described are easy to perform and provide fast results on the biosurfactants activity. However, more than one method should always be performed, since most of these methods are complementary.\nTo establish the biochemical composition of biosurfactants in terms of carbohydrate, protein and lipid contents several techniques can be used. For instance, the carbohydrate content of biosurfactants can be determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method using D-glucose as a standard [38]. Regarding the protein content, this can be determined using the method described by Lowry et al. [39], using bovine serum albumin as a standard, or alternatively by the Coomassie\nblue method [40, 41]. Additionally, to determine the lipid content it is first necessary to conduct an extraction with chloroform:methanol. The organic phase is then evaporated under vacuum and the lipid content can be determined by gravimetric estimation [42, 43].\nFor a better understanding of the relationship among the chemical structures of biosurfactants, the composition of mixtures and a structural detailed analysis is necessary. This can be achieved by mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy [27]. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is most useful for identifying types of chemical bonds (functional groups), therefore it can be used to elucidate some unknown components of unknown given mixture [28]. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) has also been extensively used for determining the composition of biosurfactants [27].\n1.3.\tBiosurfactants production\nThe improvement of biosurfactants production, in order to make their adoption feasible as components of large-volume commercial products, is a constant demand by industry [44]. Therefore, since the biosurfactants production has distinct characteristics, depending on the type of biosurfactant and its producer, it is first mandatory to understand the process before optimization can be envisaged. The following sections describe the kinetics of biosurfactants production, as well as the influence of the carbon and nitrogen sources, environmental factors and trace elements on the production.\n1.3.1.\tKinetics of fermentative production\nThe kinetic of biosurfactants production can be classified in three different groups depending on the different production conditions: growth-associated production, production under growthlimiting conditions, and production by resting cells (Figure 2).\n11\nFigure 2. Different biosurfactant production kinetics. (A) Growth-associated production; (B) Production under growthlimited conditions and (C) Production of biosurfactants by resting cells. (Taken from [3]).\nThe first case, growth-associated production, describes a parallel relation between biosurfactants production, substrate consumption and cell growth (Figure 2A) [3]. Several researchers have reported biosurfactants being produced in association to cell growth, e.g. rhamnolipids production by Pseudomonas spp. [3]; biodispersan by Bacilus sp. strain IAF- 343 [31]; a surface-active agent by B. cereus IAF-346 [31], and the glycoprotein AP-6 produced by Pseudomonas f/uorescens 378 [45].\nHowever, there are some biosurfactants for which the production is favored by the limitation of one or more medium components, as for example nitrogen limitations (Figure 2B) [3]. Examples include the production of a glycolipid by Norcadia sp. strain SFC-D [3]; bioemulsifier by Candida tropicaiis IIP-4 [46]; and a water-soluble biosurfactant by Toru/opsis apico/a [47].\nFor the cases in which no cell growth occurs but the cells continue using the carbon source from the medium, biosurfactants production is conducted by resting cells (Figure 2C) [3]. Examples of these type of biosurfactant production include the rhamnolipids produced by P aeruginosa CFTR-6 [48]; MELs produced by C. antarctica [49]; and sophorolipids produced by T bombicoia [3].\n1.3.2.\tFactors affecting biosurfactant production\nThe composition and properties (e.g. surface and emulsifying activity) of a biosurfactant not only depends on the producer strain, but also on the culture conditions. In other words, the nature of the carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as the nutritional limitations, trace elements, and\n12\noperational parameters such as temperature, aeration and pH will greatly influence the amount and type of biosurfactant being produced.\ni.\tCarbon Source\nSeveral microorganisms can use different types of carbon sources to produce biosurfactants. In general, glucose, sucrose, glycerol, diesel and crude oil, have been reported as good sources of carbon for biosurfactant production. However, the use of different substrates influences the biosurfactant structures, and consequently their properties. These changes are welcome if they induce improvements in the biosurfactants proprieties making them more suitable for some applications [7]. Robert et al. [50] found that P aeruginosa 4431 could grow on different carbon sources producing different rhamnolipids species, thus illustrating the influence of the carbon source. Moreover, the chain length of the carbon substrate also affects the biosurfactants production. For instance, Kitamoto and co-workers [51] demonstrated the influence of different n-alkanes on the production of MEL by C. antarctica. Their results showed that the chain length of n-alkanes affected significantly the production of MEL, the highest productivity being observed with noctadecane. On the contrary, for sophorolipids produced by C. bombicoia ATCC22214 it was found an increase in the yield with a nalkane chain length from C12 to C15 [52].\nii.\tNitrogen Source\nNitrogen is an important constituent on the culture medium for biosurfactants production, since it is an essential component of the proteins that play a role in the growth of microorganisms, and therefore in the production of enzymes required for the fermentative process. In the literature, several sources of nitrogen have been reported for the production of biosurfactants, e.g. urea, peptone, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, meat extract and malt extract. Yeast extract has been widely used for the production of biosurfactant. However, its concentration greatly depends on the nature of the producing-microorganism and the specific culture medium used. Johnson and co-workers [53] showed that potassium nitrate yield a greater amount of the biosurfactants produced by R. giutinis as compared with other nitrogen sources, namely urea or ammonium sulfate [54]. The influence of different nitrogen sources has also been evaluated for\n13\nthe rhamnolipids production, and the presence of NO3-, glutamate, and aspartate has been suggested to promote the production of rhamnolipids, whereas NH4+, glutamine, asparagine, and arginine to inhibit the rhamnolipids production [55]. Nitrogen limitation has been described to increase the biosurfactant production by P aeruginosa [56] and C. tropicaiis IIP-4 [46]. According to Desai et al. [3], nitrogen limitation not only causes an increase in the biosurfactants production, but also changes their composition. An important parameter studied by several researchers is the quantitative ratio between carbon and nitrogen sources (C:N) that is required for biosurfactants production. Guerra-Santos et al. [57, 58] found a maximum rhamnolipids production under nitrogen limitation at a C:N ratio of 16:1 to 18:1. On the contrary, no biosurfactant production was reported for C:N ratios below 11:1 (no nitrogen limitation). Singh et al. [46] tested different C:N ratios and hydrocarbons for the production of biosurfactants by C. tropicalis and also reported an increase in the production under nitrogen limitation.\niii.\tEnvironmental Factors\nEnvironmental factors and growth conditions such as temperature, pH, agitation, and oxygen availability also affect the biosurfactant production through their effects on cellular activity and growth.\nThe biosurfactants produced by Pseudomonas sp. strain DSM-2874 [3] and Arthrobacter paraffineus [59] were found to present different compositions as a result of temperature changes.\nAlthough most of the biosurfactants are produced at temperatures ranging from 25oC to 30oC [6], thermophilic bacteria such as Bacillus sp. have also been reported to grow and produce biosurfactants at temperatures above 40oC [60].\nCasas and Ochoa [61] studied the production of sophorolipids from C. bombicoiaat different temperatures, specifically 25oC and 30oC, and verified that temperature only slightly affects sophorolipid production when resting-cells were used. Desphande and Daniels [62] also found the maximum growth of C. bombicoiaat 30oC, but the highest biosurfactants production was observed at 27oC.\n14\nwhich corresponds to the natural sea water pH. Desai and Banat [3] described that the best pH for rhamnolipids production by Pseudomonas spp. is in the range between 6.0 and 6.5. The pH role in the glycolipids synthesis by C. antarctica and C. apico/a was evaluated [54]. When the pH value is maintained at 5.5, the biosurfactants production reaches the maximum. However, without pH control the synthesis of glycolipids decrease, thus confirming the relevance of controlling the pH during the fermentation process.\nAeration and agitation are also relevant in the production of biosurfactants, since both facilitate the oxygen transfer from the gas phase to the aqueous phase. Sheppard and Cooper [64] showed that oxygen transfer is a main parameter for the optimization and scale-up of surfactin production by B. subtilis. The influence of aeration in the production of biosurfactants by C. antarctica was evaluated, an air flow rate of 1 vvm and dissolved oxygen concentration of 50 % was observed to provide the highest yield. However, the increase of the air flow rate to 2 vvm caused foam formation, thus leading to a decrease in the biosurfactants production up to 84 % [54].\niv.\tTrace elements\nMetal ions can act as co-factors of many enzymes that are involved in the biosurfactants production, therefore the concentration of these species in the culture media play an important role in production of same biosurfactants [54]. Thimon et al. [65] showed that the presence of Fe2+ in mineral salt medium increased drastically the production of surfactin B subtilis. Furthermore, the supplementation of 0.01 mM Mn2+, which affected the nitrogen utilization, to a defined glucose medium led to an increase from 0.33 g/l to 2.6 g/l of surfactin, produced by B subtilis [66].\n1.3.3.\tCost reduction strategies for biosurfactants production\nAs previously mentioned, biosurfactants exhibit several advantages over their chemical counterparts. However, the biosurfactants production processes are still not economically interesting, thus limiting their commercialization. Indeed, the low production yields, expensive substrates and expensive recovery are the main causes for their low competitiveness [1, 67]. As such, in order to compete with chemical surfactants, the biosurfactants must present interesting functionalities/activities and better production yields [68]. For some applications, such as for\n15\n|1. INTRODUCTION\nmedicines, the higher production costs can be acceptable, since in this case biosurfactants represent high value products and the required amounts are low. Nevertheless, for the most common biosurfactants applications, namely environmental ones, high volumes of biosurfactants are required and the costs of production are unbearable [69].\nTo make biosurfactants production a cheaper process and commercially attractive, it is necessary to boost their production and recovery at larger scales. Therefore, several strategies have been proposed to make biosurfactants cost-competitive, including the development of more efficient bioprocesses, i.e. (a) optimization of fermentative conditions and cost-effective downstream recovery processes; (b) replacement of synthetic media by cheaper and waste substrates; and (c) development of overproducing mutant or recombinant strains ( Figure 3) [1, 70].\nThe first two strategies have been widely explored and reported in several studies that showed considerably improvements in the biosurfactants production.\nGrowth on low-cost\nsubstrate\nOptimization of culture/process\n1\nMICROORGANISMS\t\tPRODUCTION\t\tDOWNSTREAM\nI\nOver-producing strains\nEfficient methods of recovery and purification\nFigure 3. Different cost-reduction strategies for biosurfactants production. (Adapted from [1]).\n16\ni.\tGrowth on low-cost substrates as promising alternatives\nsuggested the use of low-cost raw substrates. For example, the use of agro-based raw materials or wastes (e.g. potato, cassava and soybean) have been extensively explored, since these contain high levels of carbohydrates or lipids to support biomass growth and biosurfactants synthesis. Moreover, plant-derived oils, oil wastes, starchy substrates, distillery wastes and lactic whey have also been reported as cheap alternative raw materials for biosurfactants production [5, 69, 70]. Table 3 compiles the main low-cost substrates used for biosurfactants synthesis, as well as the yield and type of biosurfactant produced.\nTable 3.

Specifically, molasses consist of sugars (sucrose 48-56 %), non-sugar organic matter (9-12 %), proteins, inorganic components and vitamins [67]. Onbasli and Aslim [71] reported the production of rhamnolipids by two strains, Pseudomonas luteola B17 and Pseudomonasputida B12, on 5 % (w/v) of sugar beet molasses. There are also reports on the use of molasses in combination with other cheap substrates. Patel and Desai [72] reported the\n17\nproduction of rhamnolipids by P aeruginosa GS3 combining molasses and corn steep liquor (CSL) as carbon and nitrogen source, respectively.\nLactic whey is an effluent from dairy industry that has been reported as a good and cheap substrate for microbial growth and biosurfactants production. Lactose is the main component of lactic whey corresponding to 75 % of dry matter, being also composed by 12-14 % of protein, vitamins and organic acids [68]. To use the lactose effectively, the chosen organism must be capable of consuming the lactose and the breakdown products, galactose and glucose [69]. Koch and co-workers [73] developed a strain of P aeruginosa able to produce rhamnolipids from whey. Daniel et al. [74] reported the production of sophorolipids, obtained by a two-stage process starting from deproteinized whey concentrate, using Cryptococcus curvatusATCC20509 and C. bombicoia ATCC22214. The B. iicheniformis strain M104 was also described to grow in whey producing biosurfactants [75], as well as the B. subtilis 20B strain, to produce surfactin [76]. Rodrigues et al. [77] performed a screening of Lactobacilus strains able to produce biosurfactants. The lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus casei,Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus coryniformis torquens were select as biosurfactants-producing strains, with L. pentosus being considered the most promising strain and whey as a potential alternative substrate.\nThe combination of cheese whey and molasses was evaluated by Rodrigues and co-workers [78], as substrates for the biosurfactants production by Streptococcus thermophilus A and Lactococcus iactis 53 strains. The authors reported an increase of 1.2-1.5 times in the mass of biosurfactants produced per gram of cell dry weight, with 75 % cost reduction. Therefore, the supplemented molasses and cheese whey media was suggested as a relatively inexpensive and economical alternative to synthetic media, for biosurfactants production by these probiotic bacteria.\nii.\tOptimization of culture parameters\nAs already mentioned, the final amount, quality and type of produced biosurfactants depend on the culture conditions. Environmental factors are exceptionally significant in the yield and characteristics of the biosurfactants produced. The optimization of process conditions, in order to increase the amounts of biosurfactants, is a required step for any profit-making biotechnology industry [54]. Several elements, media composition and precursors, affect the biosurfactant production process. Different elements, such as nitrogen, iron and manganese have been reported\n18\nto affect the biosurfactants yield. For example, the addition of iron and manganese to the culture medium was reported to increase the production of biosurfactants by B. subtiiis [79]. The interaction of different components in the medium also affects biosurfactant production, therefore the ratios of different elements, C:N, C:P, C:Fe or C:Mg, should also be studied and optimized to enhance the production yields [70].\nTo maximize the biosurfactants production and reduce the costs it is necessary the use of process-optimization strategies that involve multiple factors. The classical method of medium optimization involves changing one variable at time, while keeping the others at fixed levels. Nevertheless, this methodology is laborious, time consuming and does not guarantee the determination of the optimal conditions for biosurfactants production. To overcome some of the disadvantages of traditional methodologies, a statistical optimization strategy based on response surface methodology (RSM), which explores the relationships between several variables, has been used by several researchers [70]. For instance, this methodology was used to determine the optimum media and environmental conditions for enhanced surfactin production by B subtiiis [8082]. RSM has also been used to optimized culture media for rhamnolipids production by P. aeruginosa strains [83]. Rodrigues et al. [84] described the application of RSM for the optimization of medium components for biosurfactants production, by probiotic bacteria. An increase in productivity was observed in all the cases, showing that optimization methods would help to design the best media containing cheaper substrates, and to use the most favorable environmental conditions, for the improved production of biosurfactants.\niii.\tRecovery and purification of biosurfactants\nFor many biotechnological products, the downstream processing costs account for most of the total production cost, approximately 60 %. Therefore, optimization of biosurfactants production using optimal media and culture conditions is not enough to reduce the total costs, i.e. the production process is still incomplete without an efficient and economical recovery process. Several recovery methods for biosurfactants have been reported. Conventional methods include acid precipitation, solvent extraction, centrifugation and ammonium sulfate precipitation. In recent years, a few unconventional recovery methods have also been described, such as foam fractionation, ultrafiltration and ion exchanged chromatography [2, 70] (Table 4).\n19\nExtraction with solvents, namely chloroform, acetone and methanol, has shown some disadvantages, since they are toxic and harmful to the environment. Due to these disadvantages, cheap and less toxic solvents, such as methyl tertiary-butyl ether, have been successfully used to recovery biosurfactants produced by Rhodococcus species [41].\nOften, a single downstream processing technique is not enough for biosurfactants recovery and purification. In these cases, it is applied a multi-step downstream strategy [2]. For instance, extraction of low-molecular-weight biosurfactants normally involves an initial precipitation step, followed by extraction with different organic solvents according to the hydrophobicity and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value of the compounds. As an example, rhamnolipids are usually precipitated by acidification; followed by solvent extraction, e.g. with ethyl acetate. In the case of high-molecular-weight biosurfactants, normally they are extracted by ammonium sulfate precipitation and then purified by dialysis [1].\nIn sum, these recovery techniques are already well established for lab-scale applications, however some of them could not yet be applied to an industrial scale due to their operational costs. Therefore, several efforts have been conducted towards the development of low-cost extraction and purification processes, avoiding the use of hazardous and costly organic solvents [1].\nTable 4.

Their unique properties allow their application in a wide variety of commercial areas and industrial processes, replacing the chemical surfactants. Some of the potential applications of biosurfactants are presented in Table 5, as well as their role in each industrial field.\n21\nTable 5. Biosurfactants applications in industry.

Specifically, they constitute suitable alternatives to synthetic medicines and antimicrobial agents, and may be applied as safe and effective therapeutic agents [85].\ni.\tAntimicrobial activity\nNumerous biosurfactants have been shown to possess antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, algae and viruses. For instance, the iturin lipopeptide produced by B. subtilis showed potential antifungal activity [86], as seen by the alterations in the morphology and structure of yeast cells [85]. Surfactin produced by B subti/is was reported to inactivate the enveloped virus such as herpes and retrovirus [87].\n22\nconcentrations ranging from 0.4 to 10.0 mg/l [2]. Abalos et al. [88] studied the activity of rhamnolipids produced by P aeruginosa AT10. These biosurfactants showed a good inhibitory activity against several bacteria, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia co/i, Aicaiigenes faecaiis (32 mg/ml), Mycobacterium ph/ei, Serratia marcescens (16 mg/ml) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8 mg/ml); it was also detected good antifungal properties against Aspergillus niger (16 mg/ml), Chaetonium giobosum, Aureobasidium pullulans, Enicillium crysogenum (32 mg/ml) and the phytopathogenic Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia soiani(18 mg/ml).\nRodrigues and co-workers [89] reported the antimicrobial activity of two probiotic bacteria, L. lactis 53 and S. thermophilus A, against a variety of bacterial and yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses. The authors found that the biosurfactants produced by both microorganisms have a high antimicrobial activity even at low concentrations, against C. tropicalis GB 9/9, one of the strains responsible for prostheses failure. Moreover, at the highest concentration tested, 100 mg/ml, the biosurfactants were effective against all the strains of bacteria and yeast tested. The activity of probiotic biosurfactants produced by lactobacilli was also discussed by Reid et al. [90, 91]. The authors suggested a possible probiotic role of these biosurfactants in the restoration and maintenance of healthy urogenital and intestinal tracts as an alternative treatment to antibiotics, conferring protection against pathogens. The biosurfactants produced by Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 reduced, in a rat model, infections associated to surgical implants, which are mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, through inhibition of growth and reduction of the adherence to surgical implants [92].\nii.\tAnti-adhesive activity\nThe anti-adhesive activity of biosurfactants has also been extensively debated, since they are capable of inhibiting the adhesion of pathogenic organisms to solid surfaces or to infections sites. Moreover, it has been suggested that prior adhesion of biosurfactants to solid surfaces might constitute a new and effective means of combating colonization by pathogenic microorganisms [93]. For example, pre-coating vinyl urethral catheters by running a surfactin solution through them, before inoculation with media, resulted in a decrease in the amount of biofilm formed by Salmonella enterica, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabi/is and E coii [94]. These results showed the\n23\ngreat potential of biosurfactants to treat the infections caused by opportunist microorganisms, such as Salmonella species, including in urinary tract infections of AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) patients [93]. Efforts in the development of strategies to prevent the microbial colonization of silicone rubber voice prostheses was investigated by Rodrigues and co-workers [95, 96]. The ability of biosurfactants obtained from probiotic bacteria to inhibit adhesion of several bacterial and yeast strains, through the pre-conditioning of silicone rubber was evaluated. The authors observed over 90 % reduction in the initial deposition rates for most of the bacterial strains tested. The biosurfactants synthetized by S thermophilus A proved to be the most effective against Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, which is one of the microorganisms responsible for valve prosthesis failure. Other studies also reported the pre-treatment of silicone rubber with biosurfactants produced by S. thermophilus, showing that they were capable of inhibiting 85 % of C. albicans adhesion [97], whereas biosurfactants produced by probiotic bacteria, L. fermentum and Lactobacilus acidophilus adsorbed on glass could reduce in 77 % the adhering cells of Enterococcus faeca/is [2]. Gan et al. [92] reported that L. fermentum biosurfactants inhibited S aureus infection and adherence to surgical implants.\n1.4.2.\tMicrobial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR)\nCrude oil recovery occurs in three main phases. Primary recovery, in which oil production occurs under natural pressure, leads to the recovery of 15 % of the oil in place. Secondary recovery, in which the oil well is flooded with water or other substances including CO2 injection, alkaline surfactant polymers or solvents, leads to an additional 15-20 % oil recovery. The tertiary recovery or enhanced oil recovery is used to recover the remaining oil after primary and secondary recovery methods are exhausted or no longer economic. MEOR has been gaining significance as a tertiary process leading to an additional oil recovery up to 10 % [34]. This methodology used microorganisms and/or their metabolic end products for the recovery of residual oil that is hindered, due to low permeability of some reservoirs or high viscosity resulting in poor mobility. Specifically, biosurfactants have been proposed for MEOR in the recent years. The ability of biosurfactants to reduce oil/water interfacial tension and to form stable emulsions can help the oil move more freely away from rocks and crevices, so that it may travel more easily out of the well [1, 7, 34].\n24\nRhamnolipids have been most frequently used in MEOR, although lipopeptides, such as surfactin and emulsan, have also been demonstrated to be very effective in enhancing oil recovery [1]. Biosurfactants produced by Rhodococcus ruberand R. erythropoiis were tested to extract hydrocarbons from oil shale in flask experiments. The maximum recovery observed was 26 % and 25 % for the two strains, respectively [98]. Pornsunthorntawee et al. [99] observed that both biosurfactants produced by P. aeruginosa SP4 and B. subti/is PT2 were more effective than the chemical surfactants tested in the recovery of oil entrapped in a sand-packed column.\nIn conclusion, the high diversity and properties of biosurfactants have been the focus of interest of many researchers. Moreover, their versatility towards a wide range of applications has also aroused the industrial attention. For some biosurfactants and their specific producingmicroorganisms, several advances have been achieved in order to reduce production costs, and therefore to make them industrially profitable products. Likewise, these studies should also be conducted for other producing-microorganisms that have not been deeply investigated, e.g. lactic acid bacteria. The applicability of new biosurfactants in different areas should be further explored, as well as their interaction with each other, in order to develop enhanced properties and activities. In other words, the investigation of biosurfactant mixtures aiming at the enhancement of their activity is pointed as a strategy to ease their applicability in different areas, thus competing with standard methodologies/compounds applied.\n25\n2.MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1.\tBiosurfactants production\n2.1.1.\tStrains and standard culture conditions\nThe following bacterial strains were screened for biosurfactant production: Lactobacilus animaiis ATCC35046 and Lactobacillus hamster ATCC43851, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (USA); Lactobacillus agiiis CCUG31450, obtained from the Culture Collection of University of Goteborg (Sweden); Lactobacillus paracasei A20, isolated from a Portuguese dairy industry [100]; S', thermophi/usA isolated from a Dutch dairy industry [101]; P aeruginosa PX112 and B subtiiis PX573, isolated from crude oil samples obtained from a Brazilian oil field [102, 103]. The culture media used were: MRS medium (medium introduced by De Man et al. [104]) for cultivation of Lactobacillus species (OXOID, Basingstoke, England); M17 medium [105] (OXOID, Basingstoke, England) for cultivation of S', thermophi/us A; Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for cultivation of P aeruginosa PX112 and B subtiiis PX573. The composition of LB medium was (g/l): NaCl 10.0; tryptone 10.0; yeast extract 5.0; with pH adjusted to 7.0. All the media were sterilized at 121\u00b0C for 15 min.\nFor antimicrobial assays, the following strains kindly provided by the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto (Portugal) were used: E coii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Streptococcus agaiactiae and C. albicans. For anti-adhesive assays were only used the strains of S. aureus and P aeruginosa, previously mentioned. These strains were cultured in LB medium at 37\u00b0C.\nAll the strains were stored at -80\u00b0C in the appropriate medium supplemented with 20 % (v/v) glycerol solution until use. Whenever required, frozen stocks were streaked on agar plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C for further culturing. The agar plates were stored at 4\u00b0C no longer than 2 weeks.\n2.1.2.\tScreening of biosurfactant-producing strains\nBiosurfactant production by the different bacterial strains was studied in 500 ml flasks containing 200 ml of the culture medium established for each strain (Table 6). Each flask was inoculated with 2 ml of a pre-culture. Pre-cultures were prepared as follows: for P. aeruginosa PX112 and B subtiiis PX573 a single colony was taken from an agar plate and transferred to a\n29\nflask containing 25 ml of LB liquid medium; in the case of Lactobacillus strains and S thermophilus A, 100 pl of a frozen stock were transferred directly into 25 ml of MRS or M17 medium, respectively. Pre-cultures were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C and 100 rpm, except for B. subtilis PX573, which was incubated without shaking. The cultures were incubated in the same conditions than the corresponding pre-cultures.\nTable 6.

Biomass concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm using a multi-detection microplate reader Synergy\u2122 HT (BioTek, USA). Whenever its value was higher than 0.7, the samples were diluted and the optical density was measured again. In the case of B. subtilis PX573, due to the formation of a pellicle in the surface of the medium, it was not possible to evaluate the growth by measuring the optical density during the fermentation. In this case, at the end of the fermentation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 20 min) and cell dry weight (g/l) was determined (24h at 105\u00b0C).\nAfter measuring the cell growth, the samples were centrifuged (9000 rpm, 20 min) and the cell-free supernatants were used to measure the surface tension and the emulsifying activity, as described below.\nBiosurfactants can be excreted to the culture medium (extracellular biosurfactants) or remain attached to the cell wall (intracellular biosurfactants). Lactic acid bacteria usually produce mainly intracellular biosurfactants. In this case, the surface tension measured in the cell-free supernatants gives an indication of the extracellular biosurfactants produced; at the end of the fermentation the intracellular biosurfactants were extracted and the surface tension of the extract was measured to evaluate the intracellular biosurfactants production.\n30\nAll the cultures were maintained until the maximum biosurfactant production was achieved (until the surface tension values remained constant). At the end of the fermentation, the biosurfactants were recovered as described below.\n2.1.3.\tAlternative culture media\nIn order to reduce the production costs, biosurfactant production was investigated using industrial wastes as cheaper substrates, to replace synthetic media. Alternative low-cost media were prepared using molasses; cheese whey and corn steep liquor. All these substrates were supplied by local industries.\ni.\tCorn steep liquor (CSL) medium\nThe CSL medium was prepared by dissolving CSL (10 % (v/v)) in demineralized water. The medium was adjusted to pH 7.0 and autoclaved (15 min at 121\u00b0C).\nii.\tCSL and molasses (CSLM) medium\nA medium containing CSL and molasses (CSLM) was prepared by dissolving molasses (10 % (w/v)) and CSL (10 % (v/v)) in demineralized water. The medium was adjusted to pH 7.0 and autoclaved (15 min at 121\u00b0C).\niii.\tCheese whey medium (CWM)\nThe CWM was prepared by dissolving cheese whey in demineralized water at a concentration of 100 g/l. The solution was sterilized (121\u00b0C for 15 min) and the precipitates formed were removed by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 40 min). The supernatants obtained were used as culture medium. The initial pH of this medium was 6.2.\n2.1.4.\tOptimization of culture conditions\ni.\tEffect of aeration on biosurfactant production\n31\n200 rpm, whereas P. aeruginosa PX112 was grown at 100, 180 and 200 rpm. All the experiments were performed in 500 ml flasks containing 200 ml of culture medium. Regarding the lactic acid bacteria (L. agiiisCCUG31450, L. animalisATCC35046 and L. hamster ATCC43851), growth and biosurfactant production were studied under aerobic, anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. Aerobic and microaerophilic cultures were performed in 500 ml flasks containing 200 ml of MRS medium at 100 rpm and without shaking, respectively. Anaerobic cultures were performed in 50 ml flasks containing 25 ml of MRS medium. After inoculation, the flasks were sealed with rubber stoppers, and oxygen was removed by aseptically bubbling oxygen-free nitrogen into the flasks for 10 min.\nIn all the cases, samples were taken at different time points during the fermentation to determine growth and biosurfactant production, except in the case of anaerobic cultures, where they were evaluated at the end of the fermentation.\n2.1.5.\tEffect of trace elements on biosurfactant production\nThe effect of different trace elements (iron, manganese and magnesium) on biosurfactant production by P. aeruginosa PX112 and E. subtiiis PX573 was evaluated. The culture media used for these assays were the ones previously optimized for each strain (CSLM for P. aeruginosa PX112 and CSL for E. subtiiis PX573), which were supplemented with different trace elements at different concentrations as shown in Table 7 and Table 8. Control assays were performed using the media without trace elements.\nTable 7.

The different combinations tested are shown in Table 9.\nTable 9.

Therefore, depending on the biosurfactant, the processes used for biosurfactant recovery are different. For the extracellular biosurfactants, three different techniques were evaluated: acid precipitation (for biosurfactants which become insoluble at low pH values); solvent extraction (where organic solvents are used to extract the biosurfactants from the culture medium); and ammonium sulfate precipitation (the biosurfactants are precipitated through a salting-out process) [2]. Regarding the intracellular biosurfactants, they were extracted from the cell-wall as described below.\ni.\tExtracellular biosurfactants\nAt the end of fermentation, the culture broth was centrifuged (9000 rpm, 20 min) to remove the cells and the cell-free supernatants were subjected to the different recovery techniques.\n-\tAcid precipitation\nThe cell-free supernatants were adjusted to pH 2.0 with HCl 18 % (v/v) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C to promote the precipitation of the biosurfactants. Afterwards, the precipitates (crude biosurfactants) were collected by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 20 min, 4\u00b0C). The crude biosurfactants were dissolved in a minimal amount of demineralized water and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 using NaOH 1 M. Finally, the biosurfactant solutions were freeze-dried and the products obtained weighed and stored at -20\u00b0C for further studies.\n-\tSolvent extraction\nThe cell-free supernatants were extracted with 3 volumes of chloroform or a mixture of chloroform:methanol:butanol (1:1:1 v/v/v). The mixtures were continuously shaken at room temperature for 5h. Subsequently, the mixtures was transferred to a separating funnel and allowed to separate overnight. The organic (lower) phase was recovered and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator at room temperature. The viscous product obtained was dissolved in a minimal amount of demineralized water, the surface tension was measured, and after that the solution was freeze-dried. The upper phase was extracted again in the same conditions to recover the maximum amount of biosurfactant.\n34\n- Ammonium sulfate precipitation\nAmmonium sulfate was added to the biosurfactant-containing cell-free supernatants to a final concentration of 40 % (w/v) with stirring. This process was performed at 4\u00b0C and the mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 20 min, 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in demineralized water [111]. After measuring the surface tension, the solution was freeze-dried.\nii.\tIntracellular biosurfactants\nBiosurfactants attached to the cell wall must be extracted from the cells. At the end of the fermentation, cells were harvested by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 20 min), washed once in the same volume of demineralized water, and resuspended in phosphate-bufered saline (PBS: 10 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 and 150 mM NaCl with pH adjusted to 7.0). 15 ml of PBS buffer were used per 100 ml of culture broth [101]. The suspension was left at room temperature for 2h with gentle stirring to promote biosurfactant release. Subsequently, the cells were removed by centrifugation and the remaining supernatant liquid was filtered through a 0.2 pm pore-size filter (Whatman, GE Healthcare, UK). The supernatant was dialyzed against demineralized water at 4\u00b0C in a Cellu-Sep\u00a9 membrane (molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) 6000-8000 Dalton; Membrane Filtration Products, Inc., USA) for 48h and freeze-dried. After being lyophilized the biosurfactants were stored at -20\u00b0C for further studies. In order to confirm biosurfactant production, during the extraction process the surface tension was routinely measured as described below.\n2.2.\tBiosurfactants characterization\n2.2.1.\tSurface-activity determination\n35\nwas used. Whenever required, the culture broth supernatants were diluted 10 times (ST-1) or 100 times (ST-2) with demineralized water and the surface tension was measured as described above. In order to increase the accuracy of the surface tension measurements, an average of duplicates was determined. All the measurements were performed at room temperature (20\u00b0C).\n2.2.2.\tEmulsifying activity determination\nEmulsifying activity was determined by the addition of 2 ml of nhexadecane to the same volume of cell-free culture broth supernatants or biosurfactant solutions in glass test tubes. The tubes were mixed with vortex at high speed for 2 min and subsequently incubated at 25\u00b0C for 24h. The stability of the emulsion was determined after 24h, and the emulsification index (E24, %) was calculated as the percentage of the height of the emulsified layer (mm) divided by the total height of the liquid column (mm) [103]. Whenever required, the culture broth supernatants were diluted 10 times (E24-1) or 100 times (E24-2) with demineralized water and the emulsifying activity was measured as described above.\n2.2.3.\tCritical micelle concentration (CMC)\nCritical micelle concentration is defined as the concentration of an amphiphilic compound in solution at which the formation of micelles is initiated. Therefore, it is important for several biosurfactant applications to establish the CMC, as above this concentration no further effect is expected in the surface activity. Crude biosurfactant solutions at different concentrations (depending on the microorganism and the culture medium used) were prepared in PBS buffer, and the surface tension of each sample was determined by the Ring method at room temperature (20\u00b0C) as described above. The CMC was determined by plotting the surface tension as a function of the logarithm of biosurfactant concentration and it was found at the point of intersection between the two lines that best fit through the pre- and post-CMC data [35]. All the measurements were done in duplicate.\n36\n2.2.4.\tBiosurfactant stability\nThe applicability of biosurfactants can be conditioned by their stability to different environmental parameters. Therefore, the effect of pH, temperature and salinity on the activity of biosurfactants produced by B. subti/is PX573 and P aeruginosa PX112 was determined. Stability studies were performed using the cell-free broths obtained by centrifuging the cultures (at the end of the fermentation) at 9000 rpm for 20 min. In order to assess the effect of salinity on biosurfactant activity, the culture broth supernatants were supplemented with different NaCl concentrations (from 10 to 200 g/l). The surface tension and the emulsification indexes were measured as described above and compared with the corresponding values without addition of NaCl. To evaluate the stability of the biosurfactants to high temperatures, the broth samples were incubated at 121\u00b0C for 20 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. Surface tension and emulsification indexes were measured and compared to the corresponding values before heat treatment. The pH stability was studied by adjusting the cell-free broths to different pH values (2.0-13.0) using HCl or NaOH solutions. Then surface tension values and emulsification indexes were measured as described above. In the case of L. agiiis CCUG31450 (that produces mainly intracellular biosurfactants) the stability assays were performed in the same way but using the freeze-dried biosurfactants dissolved in PBS buffer at a concentration of 7.5 mg/ml.\n2.2.5.\tThin layer chromatography (TLC)\nA preliminary characterization of the different crude biosurfactants obtained was obtained by TLC. Lyophilized biosurfactant samples were dissolved in different solvents (methanol or acetonitrile) or PBS buffer. Between 4 and 8 pl of each sample were applied to a 10 x 20 cm silica gel TLC plate (Fluka\u00ae Analytical, Germany). The plates were developed using two different mobile phases: (a) chloroform-methanol-water (65:25:4 v/v/v) [113,114]; (b) acetonitrile-water (6:3 v/v) [115]. Subsequently the plates were air dried and visualized under ultra-violet (UV) light (254 and 366 nm) and the different spots detected were recorded. The retention factor (Rf) value for each spot was calculated as:\nmigration distance of substance spot\nmigration distance of solvent front\n37\n2.3.\tAnalytical techniques\nThe alternative culture media used and some of the biosurfactants produced were analyzed for total of carbohydrates and protein contents using the following methods:\n2.3.1.\tCarbohydrate concentration\nTotal carbohydrates were determined using the phenol-sulfuric acid method as described by DuBois et al. [38]. Briefly, each sample (1 ml) was mixed with 20 pl of phenol solution (80 % (w/v)) in glass test tubes. Then 2.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid (95-97 %) were added to each tube with slight shaking. The samples were left at room temperature for 10 min, shaken again and allowed to stand at room temperature for another 20 min. Afterwards, the optical density of each sample was measured at 490 nm using a multi-detection microplate reader Synergy\u2122 HT (BioTek, USA). The carbohydrates concentration was determined using a calibration curve prepared using glucose at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mg/l. All the assays were performed in triplicate.\n2.3.2.\tProtein concentration\nThe protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford assay using a protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). Briefly, 30 pl of sample were mixed with 1.5 ml of Bradford reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Subsequently, the optical density at 595 nm was measured using a multi-detection microplate reader Synergy\u2122 HT (BioTek, USA). The total amount of protein was determined using a calibration curve prepared using bovine serum albumin (BSA) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mg/ml. All the assays were performed in triplicate.\n38\n2.4.\tBiosurfactants applications\n2.4.1.\tAntimicrobial assays\nThe antimicrobial activity of the different biosurfactants against several microbial strains (E co/i S. aureus, P aeruginosa, S. agaiactiae and C. albicans') was determined using the microdilution method in 96-well plastic tissue culture plates (Orange Scientific, Belgium). The freeze-dried biosurfactants were dissolved in LB medium at different concentrations, and biosurfactant solutions were sterilized by filtration through a 0.2 pm pore-size filter (Whatman, GE Healthcare, UK). Subsequently, 250 pl of sterile biosurfactant solution were placed into the first column of the 96-well microplate, and 125 pl of sterile LB medium in the remaining wells. After that, 125 pl of biosurfactant solution from the first column were transferred to the second column and mixed with the medium. Serially, 125 pl were transferred to the subsequent wells, discarding 125 pl of the mixture in the tenth column, so that the final volume for each well was 125 pl. This process results in two-fold serial dilutions of the biosurfactant in the first 10 columns. Columns 11 and 12 do not contain biosurfactant and serve as growth and negative controls, respectively. All the wells (except for the 12th column) were inoculated with 5 pl of a pre-culture growth overnight in LB medium at 37\u00b0C diluted to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.3. Microplates were covered and incubated for 24h at 37\u00b0C. After 24h of incubation, 125 pl of demineralized water were added to each well and the optical density at 600 nm was determined using a multi-detection microplate reader Synergy\u2122 HT (BioTek, USA). The growth inhibition percentages at different biosurfactant concentrations for each microorganism were calculated as:\n% Growth inhibitionc\n/0Dc\\]\nHod]\nx 100\nwhere ODc represents the optical density of the well with a biosurfactant concentration c and ODo is the optical density of the control well (without biosurfactant) [112]. Triplicate assays were performed for the different microorganisms and biosurfactant concentrations.\n39\n2.4.2.\tAnti-adhesion assays\nThe anti-adhesive activity of the different biosurfactants against P aeruginosa and S aureus was determined according to the procedure described by Gudina et al. [112]. Briefly, the wells of a sterile 96-well flat-bottomed plastic tissue culture plate (Orange Scientific, Belgium) were filled with 200 pl of biosurfactant solutions prepared in demineralized water at different concentrations. The plate was incubated for at least 18h at 4\u00b0C and subsequently washed twice with PBS buffer. Control wells contained distilled water. An aliquot of 200 pl of a washed bacterial suspension in PBS adjusted to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.6 was added to each well and incubated for 24h at 4\u00b0C. Unattached microorganisms were removed by washing the wells twice with PBS. The adherent microorganisms were fixed with 200 pl of 99 % methanol per well, and after 15 min the plates were emptied and left to dry. After that, the plates were stained for 5 min with 200 pl of 33 % crystal violet (used for Gram staining) per well. Excess stain was rinsed out by washing the wells three times with PBS. Subsequently the plates were air dried; the dye bound to the adherent microorganisms was re-solubilized with 200 pl of 33 % (v/v) glacial acetic acid per well and the optical density of each well was measured at 595 nm. The microbial inhibition percentages at different biosurfactant concentrations for each microorganism were calculated as:\n% Microbial inhibitionc\nrODc\\\\\nHod]\nx 100\nwhere ODc represents the optical density of the well with a biosurfactant concentration c and ODo is the optical density of the control well (without biosurfactant) [112]. Triplicate assays were performed at all the biosurfactant concentrations for the two strains. This procedure allows the estimation of the biosurfactant concentrations that are more effective in inhibiting the adhesion of the studied microorganisms.\n2.4.3.\tApplication of biosurfactants in the removal of crude oil from sand\nThe applicability of biosurfactants produced by B. subtiiis PX573, P aeruginosa PX112 and L. agiiisCCUG31450, as well as the chemical surfactants Enordet and Petrostep (supplied by SNF FLOERGER (France)) in oil recovery was evaluated, using artificially contaminated sand containing\n12.5\t% (w/w) of Arabian Light oil (provided by GALP (Portugal)). Samples of 40 g of sand were\n40\nmixed with 5 g of crude oil in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks by shaking and allowed to age at room temperature for 24h. Afterwards, 40 ml of biosurfactants and chemical surfactants solutions (at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 g/l) were added to each flask. The flasks were incubated at 90 rpm and 40\u00b0C for 24h and the oil removed was recovered from the surface and its volume was measured. The amount of oil recovered (grams) was calculated according to its density (0.837 g/ml). Control assays were performed using demineralized water at the same conditions. All the experiments were carried out in duplicate.\n2.5.\tBiosurfactant mixtures\nTo evaluate the interaction between biosurfactants produced by the different microorganisms studied several mixtures with different composition and proportions were prepared. Those mixtures were evaluated in different applications, namely in antimicrobial and anti-adhesion assays as well as in removal of crude oil from sand. In this last case, two chemical surfactants were also tested, alone and in combination with different biosurfactants. In all the cases, the freeze-dried biosurfactants were dissolved in demineralized water (or in LB medium for the antimicrobial assays) at different concentrations, and then the different mixtures were prepared.\n2.6.\tStatistical analysis\nResults are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least two replicates. The analyses were carried out using Microsoft Office Excel software.\nStatistically significant differences of the conditions tested in the different assays were evaluated by a one-way ANOVA (P&lt;0.05) applying the Tukey multiple-comparisons. A significant difference was considered if P<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad (San Diego, USA) software.\n41\n3.\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1.\tScreening of biosurfactant-producing strains\nA total of seven isolates were screened for biosurfactants production under standard conditions. As described in the Materials and Methods section, both extracellular and intracellular biosurfactants production was evaluated through the measurement of surface tension and determination of emulsifying activity.\n3.1.1.\tLactic acid bacteria\nFive out of the seven above mentioned isolates were lactic acid bacteria. As can be seen in Table 10, none of the microorganism evaluated was found to decrease the surface tension of the culture medium, thus no extracellular biosurfactants were produced. Nevertheless, a decrease in the surface tension of the PBS could be observed for the PBS extracts revealing the production of intracellular biosurfactants. The isolate L. agi/is CCUG31450 showed the most interesting results either in relation to surface activity or emulsifying activity.\nTable 10. Screening of bacterial isolates for biosurfactant production. Reduction of culture medium surface tension (-AST) (mN/m), corresponding to excreted biosurfactants; reduction of PBS surface tension (-AST of PBS) (mN/m), corresponding to cell-bound biosurfactants; emulsification index (E24,,%) of biosurfactants in PBS; biomass (OD 600 nm) and crude biosurfactants concentration (mg/l) obtained for different lactic acid bacteria strains, grown at 37oC in MRS medium (except S. thermophilus A (M17)). The control value of surface tension for the biosurfactants extracted with PBS was 71.9 mN/m.

Examples include the work by Saravanakumari and Mani [116] that reported an extracellular biosurfactant from L. lactis able to reduce the surface tension to 40.5 mN/m; and the work by Rodrigues et al. [77] that evaluated the ability of L. pentosus CECT-4023 and L. casei to produce biosurfactants and observed that both strains were biosurfactant producers. The surface tension values of biosurfactant extracted with PBS was 50.5, 53.0 mN/m respectively. They also characterized the biosurfactants produced by L. /acts53 and reported a minimum surface tension value of 41.0 mN/m [117].\nThe lactic acid bacteria under study in the current work, namely L. agilis CCUG31450, L. animalis ATCC35046 and L. hamsiteri ATCC43851 showed surface tension values of 44.0, 47.7 and 53.7 mN/m, respectively. These values are quite similar to those previously described in the literature for other lactic acid bacteria cultured under the same conditions. Furthermore, the strain L. paracasei A20, previously studied by Gudina et al. [118] was reported to show a surface tension value of 50.0 mN/m. The surface tension value obtained is this work (47.9 mN/m) for the same strain, is in good agreement with one reported before. Previously studies about biosurfactants production by S', thermophilus A, indicated that the crude biosurfactants showed three distinct fractions (A, B and C) with surface activity, surface tension values 50, 49 and 36 mN/m, respectively [101]. The surface tension value herein obtained for S', thermophiius A, 50.0 mN/m, are very close to the values previously reported.\nThe biosurfactants production by different lactic acid bacteria in MRS medium was also observed by Velraeds et al. [119]. From all strains studied, the most interesting results for the reduction of surface tension, determined relative to the surface tension of PBS (68 mN/m), were obtained for L. acidophilusATCC4356 (27.0 mN/m); L. caseisubsp. rhamnosusATCC7469 and L. caseisubsp. rhamnosus81 (27.0 mN/m); L. fermentum B54 (29.0 mN/m); and Lactobacillus plantarum RC20 (26.0 mN/m). In general, the decrease in surface tension values obtained in this work (Table 10) are similar with the ones previously reported for lactic acid bacteria biosurfactants.\n46\n3.1.2.\tBacillus subtil is PX5 7 3\nB. subti/isPX573 was another isolate tested for biosurfactant production. This strain reduced\nthe culture medium surface tension to 31.0 mN/m, thus it was considered a good extracellular\nbiosurfactant producer (Figure 4).\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nFigure 4. Time course of biosurfactant production by B subti/is PX573 showing the profiles of surface tension (mN/m) and emulsification index (E24, %). The strain was grown on LB medium at 37oC without shaking. Results represent the average of two independent experiments \u00b1 SD.\nAnalyzing the fermentative process it can be seen that in the first 24h it occurs a great reduction of the surface tension on the culture medium, from 46.9 to 31.6 mN/m. From this time point until the end of the fermentation the values of ST and ST-1 remained almost constant. In the case of the emulsifying activity, the maximum value, 40.0 %, was observed at 72h. Similar results were reported by Vaz et al.[35] using also a B. subti/is strain; in that case, the surface tension of the culture medium was reduced to 30.1 mN/m in the first 24h, and then remained nearly constant until the end of the fermentation (144h). These researchers also noticed that the E24 values contrary to the surface tension continued increasing after the first 24h, similar results was observed in the current work with B. subti/is PX573.\n47\nin Table 11 show that the highest biosurfactant concentration is obtained at 48h, although the biomass concentration reached its maximum at 72h. These results suggest that the production of biosurfactants is probably not associated with cellular growth.\nTable 11. Biomass concentration (g dry weight/l) and crude biosurfactant concentration (mg/l) obtained for B. subtilis PX573 grown in LB medium at 37oC without shaking. Results represent the average of two independent experiments \u00b1 SD.\nTime (h)\t[Biomass] (mg/l)\t[Crude biosurfactant] (mg/l)\n48\t0.914 \u00b1 0.03\t726.7\n72\t1.159 \u00b1 0.08\t533.3\nIn these experiments, in which the B subtilis PX573 strain was cultured without agitation, we noticed that after 48h of fermentation the biomass was very difficult to separate from the culture broth by centrifugation since the cells do not sediment easily, thus compromising the total amount of biosurfactant being recovered (most probably underestimated). In summary, although the surface tension remained constant until the end of fermentation, the amount of biosurfactant recovered was lower at 72h than at 48h of fermentation, not due biosurfactant degradation but due to the recovery limitations.\nGhribi et al. [120] studied the production of biosurfactants by B subtilis SPB1 in a mineral medium with glucose as the carbon source. The bacterium produced 720 mg of biosurfactant/l at the end of the fermentation. The amounts of biosurfactant obtained in our study for 48h of fermentation are in good agreement with that study. Makkar and Cameotra [121] studied the production of biosurfactants by B subtilis MTCC1427 in a minimum medium supplemented with 2 % sucrose, at 30\u00b0C and pH 9. The biosurfactant concentration obtained in those conditions was 808.0 mg/l at 48h of fermentation. The same authors also studied the production of biosurfactants by a different B subtilis strain in a mineral salt medium. After 72h of fermentation, the biosurfactants production was 342 mg/l, which is quite low as compared with the concentrations obtained in the current study (Table 11). Similar results were reported for the strain B subtilis 28 studied by Toledo and co-workers [122], that provided 430 mg/l of biosurfactant.\n48\n3.1.3.\tPseudomonas aeruginosa PX112\nP. aeruginosa PX112 was the last isolate being evaluated. Figure 5 illustrates the fermentation profiles of growth and biosurfactant production.\nIn the case of this strain, the biosurfactant production was found to be associated with cellular growth, as an increase in the biomass concentration led to a decrease in the surface tension, especially in the first 48h. The surface tension continued dropping until 72h reaching its lowest value (33.0 N/m), and then remained nearly constant until de end of fermentation (96h). The E24 values also reached the highest value at 72h, 60.0 %. After this time point the E24 values remained constant until the end of fermentation. At the end of fermentation the biosurfactants present in the culture medium were recovered by acid precipitation. The amount of biosurfactant obtained was 136.1 \u00b1 41.6 mg/l.\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nz\nE.\nE o '35\nc o\nI-\no o ra t\n3 v>\nFigure 5.

Results represent the average of two independent experiments \u00b1 SD.\nThe biosurfactant production by P. aeruginosa BS-161R in Bushnell-Haas medium was evaluated by Kumar et al. [55]. In this case the yield of rhamnolipid produced was 369 mg/l, slightly higher than the one that we obtained using the P. aeruginosa PX112 strain (136 mg/l). Wei et al. [123] studied the rhamnolipid production by P. aeruginosa J4 grown in LB at 30oC, 200\n49\nrpm. The yield obtained, 773 mg/l, was much higher than the one obtained for P. aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium, at 100 rpm, thus suggesting that an increase in agitation could lead to an improvement on the biosurfactant production. The production of biosurfactants by P. aeruginosa MR01 in a minimum salt medium was also described in literature [124]. The results showed that the biosurfactant production was affect by the NaCl concentration, and reported biosurfactants yields between 300 and 500 mg/l. These values are higher than ours probably as a result of the higher agitation used or due to the NaCl concentration present in LB medium.\n3.2.\tOptimization of biosurfactants production\n3.2.1.\tAlternative culture media\nIn order to reduce the production costs, biosurfactant production was investigated using industrial wastes as cheaper substrates, to replace synthetic media. Alternative low-cost media were prepared using molasses; cheese whey and corn steep liquor. All these substrates were supplied by local industries. Before analyzing the biosurfactants production using the alternative media, their characterization regarding protein and carbohydrates concentrations was conducted (Table 12).\nTable 12. Concentration of carbohydrates and protein (mg/ml) present in the industrial wastes used to prepare the different alternative media.

Previously was optimized the culture conditions for the acid lactic bacteria studied.\ni.\tOptimization of culture conditions\nIn order to evaluate the most favorable conditions of oxygenation towards an increased biosurfactant production, the acid lactic bacteria L. agi/is CCUG31450, L. animaiis ATCC35046 and L. hamsteri ATCC43851 were cultured in anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. The fermentations were ended at the time point in which the cells stopped growing. These results were compared with the ones obtained for aerobic conditions during the screening process (Section 3.1). The results suggest that aerobic conditions (Table 10) are more favorable for biosurfactant production by these lactic acid bacteria comparing to anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions (Table 13), except for the case of L. animaiisATCC35046, for which similar results were obtained under aerobic and microaerophilic conditions. For L. agi/is CCUG31450, the surface tension decrease in aerobic conditions (26.1 mN/m) was higher than in anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions (15.0 and 17.4 mN/m, respectively).\nTable 13.

Similarly to the results presented in Table 10, also in this case no reduction of the supernatants surface tension values (Table 14) was observed, thus demonstrating that L. agi/is CCUG31450 does not excrete biosurfactants into the culture medium. On the other hand, the analysis of the surface tension reduction of the PBS showed a good production of cell-bound biosurfactants for all the alternative media evaluated. Comparing the -AST values of PBS, obtained for the different alternative media and for the synthetic MRS medium, it is possible to observe a higher reduction of the PBS surface tension in the case of biosurfactants produced in MRS medium. Statistical analysis demonstrated that these differences were significant (pvalue = 0.0114). On the other hand, regarding the amount of biosurfactants recovered in the different media, a clearly higher amount was observed for the CWM (959 mg/l), contrarily to the amount obtained for the MRS medium (87.0 mg/l), after 120h of fermentation. In general, a higher concentration of biosurfactants was obtained for all the alternative media comparing with the MRS medium. However, these results must be carefully considered, since the recovered compounds can eventually include other components from the culture medium that are not surface active molecules.\nTable 14.

Cheese whey can be an interesting substrate for biosurfactant production by lactic acid bacteria, which have the ability of using lactose as a carbon source. As can be seen the bacterium L. agi/is CCUG31450 was able to produce biosurfactants in CWM, as confirmed by the decrease of PBS surface tension (Table 14), thus demonstrating that CWM could be used alternatively to MRS medium. Biosurfactant production by L. pentosus CECT-4023, a strong biosurfactant producer strain, using cheese whey as substrate was studied by Rodrigues et al. [77]. Optimization of the biosurfactant production led to a maximum biosurfactant concentration of 1.4 g /l. This value is higher than the one obtained in the current study (959.0 mg/l).\nRodrigues et al. [78] also studied the potential of other alternative media for biosurfactants production. Cheese whey and/or molasses combined with peptone and yeast extract have been used. The results obtained showed that both cheese whey and molasses media can be used as a relatively inexpensive and economical alternative to the synthetic media commonly used for biosurfactant production by probiotic bacteria. Specifically, an increase about 2 times in the mass of produced cell-bound biosurfactant per gram cell dry weight could be obtained when compared to the synthetic medium. In the current study, a higher amount of biosurfactants was obtained using CWM when compared with the medium composed by molasses, contrary to the findings of Rodrigues et al [78].\nFurthermore, in the current study we attempted to replace the yeast extract by cheaper nitrogen sources (CSL) also mentioned in other reports. Lee and co-workers [125] reported the use of CSL (5 % (v/v)) as a suitable option to replace yeast extract to produce lactic acid using Lactobacilli strains. Although in our work, the -AST of PBS was quite similar for the biosurfactants produced in CWM and CWM+CSL, the supplementation with CSL did not improve the amount of biosurfactants produced, once the results obtained for CWM (959.0 mg/l) are higher than with CWM+CSL (492.5 mg/l) after 120h of fermentation.\nIt was interesting to notice that a change in the carbon source (from glucose to lactose) induced the cells to produce more biosurfactant. However, a higher amount of biosurfactants did not imply a higher or equal surface activity. The different carbon sources yielded varying amounts of by-products [126]. Therefore, it can be speculated that the use of lactose as carbon source instead of glucose induced the cells to use another metabolic pathway, and therefore the amount\n53\nof cell-bound biosurfactant produced per gram of cell varied. Moreover, it should be noticed that biosurfactants produced in different media can have different properties and structures. Therefore, further studies were conducted to analyze the activity of the biosurfactants produced by L. agi/is CCUG31450 in CWM and MRS media.\n3.2.3.\tBacillus subtil is PX573\nThe high biosurfactant production that was found for B. subti/isPX573 in LB medium makes this microorganism an interesting choice to further optimize the biosurfactant production while reducing the production costs. Therefore, an alternative medium based on industrial wastes, such as CSL, as a low-cost substrate was studied. This alternative medium was supplemented with different trace elements and the agitation conditions were also optimized.\ni. Alternative culture media\nAfterwards the biosurfactant production was evaluated as previously mentioned through the measurement of surface tension and emulsifying activity along the time. Whenever required the cell-free supernatants were diluted 10 or 100 times, and the corresponding surface tension values and emulsification indexes (ST-1/E24-1 and ST-2/E24-2) were measured. The lowest surface tension value (30.6 mN/m) was observed at 24h, showing a high decrease in the surface tension when compared with the CSL medium itself (52.9 mN/m) (Figure 6A). After the first 24h, the surface tension values started increasing; this effect is particularly observed for the ST-2 values. In the case of the emulsifying activity (Figure 6B), the E24 values remained constant throughout the fermentation and no significant changes could be observed comparing with the emulsifying activity of the culture medium. However, analyzing the results obtained for the E24-2, an evident increase of the emulsifying activity at 48h (20 %) was found.\n54\nFigure 6. Profiles of the culture broth supernatant surface tension (mN/m) (A) and emulsification index (E24, %) (B) during the time course of the fermentation by B. subti/is PX573. The strain was cultured in CSL medium at 37oC without shaking. Results represent the average of two measurements \u00b1 SD.\nA\nB\nFurthermore, the biosurfactants concentration was also determined at two different fermentation time points. As can be seen in Table 15, a higher production of biosurfactants in CSL medium was reached at 48h.\nTable 15. Biosurfactants concentration (mg/l) obtained using B. subtilis PX573 grown in CSL medium at 37oC and without shaking.\nTime (h)\n24 48\n[Recovered biosurfactants] (mg/l)\t1236.0\t2060.0\n55\nComparing the biosurfactant concentrations obtained for the different media studied, it was found that the CSL medium is the most favorable for biosurfactant production, when compared with LB medium, which is in agreement with the ST-1 values previously obtained. Specifically, the growth of B subti/is PX573 in CSL medium showed a biosurfactants production (2060.0 mg/l) 2.8 times higher comparing with the values obtained using LB medium (726.7 mg/l). Although a higher amount of biosurfactants is produced in CSL medium, the efficiency of these molecules being produced using different media should also be considered, as described later.\nSeveral researchers described the production of biosurfactants by B. subti/is strains using low-cost substrates. Al-Bahry et al. [127] studied the biosurfactant production by B subti/is B20 grown in a low-cost molasses-based mineral media. Acidic precipitation allowed recovering 2.29 g/l crude biosurfactant using a medium containing 80 g/l molasses. These biosurfactants reduced the surface tension from 58 to 27 mN/m. Nitschke et al. [15] obtained a crude biosurfactant concentration of 3.0 g/l after 48h of fermentation growing B subtiiis LB5a in cassava waste. These biosurfactants reduced the surface tension of the medium to 26.6 mN/m. The biosurfactant yields obtained in the current work (2.06 g/l, 48h) are in agreement with the values reported in the literature. In this way, CSL can be considered an interesting alternative low-cost substrate for the production of biosurfactants.\nii.\tOptimization of culture conditions\nAfter studying the biosurfactants production using the alternative media CSL, a further optimization step was conducted regarding the agitation rates (from 0 to 200 rpm). Similarly to the experiments without agitation, the most interesting results regarding the emulsifying activity were achieved at 48h (Figure 7B), principally for the E24\"1 (36 %) and E24\"2 (16 %) values comparing with the culture medium (E24\"1, 20 %, and E24\"2, 0 %). A pronounced decrease of the surface tension, from 52.9 to 29.7 mN/m, was observed in the first 24h (Figure 7A). Nevertheless, the ST-1 and ST-2 values were found to continuously decrease until 48h of fermentation. After 48h of fermentation, the concentration of biosurfactants was 2171.8 \u00b1 18.0 mg/l.\n56\nTime (h)\nFigure 7. Profiles of the culture both supernatant surface tension (mN/m) (A) and emulsification index (E24, %) (B) during the time course of the fermentation by B subtilis PX573. The strain was grown on CSL medium at 37oC and 200 rpm. Results represent the average of two measurements \u00b1 SD.\niii.\tEffect of trace elements\nThe alternative CSL medium was supplemented with three metal ions, Fe2+ (conditions B.A, B.B and B.C), Mn2+ (conditions B.D, B.E and B.F) and Mg2+ (conditions B.G, B.H and B.I) at different concentrations (Table 7). From Figure 8 it can be seen that almost all the conditions studied led to a decrease of surface tension as compared with the control (CSL without supplementation). The conditions B.C, B.E and B.H stand out as the best ones, presenting the most notable effect in the decrease of surface tension, mainly showed by the ST-2 values at 48h (Figure 8C), 48.5 mN/m, 48.7 mN/m and 49.0 mN/m, respectively. These results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison test, Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test. The\n57\n58\ndifferences observed between the surface tension values of the control and B.C, B.F and B.H conditions were found to be statistically significant (pvalue = 0.0108).\nAlthough the differences in the surface tension values were obvious, this was not reflected in the amount of biosurfactants being recovered (Table 16). Indeed, a slightly higher biosurfactant production was found in the control comparing with the experiments in which trace elements have been supplemented. Thus, a higher amount of biosurfactants recovery did not correspond to a higher surface activity. It is well-known that biosurfactants produced in different media can present different properties, which might have been the case. On the other hand, the presence of impurities in the media may also differ, thus leading to different biosurfactant efficiencies.\nTable 16. Biosurfactant production (mg/l) by B subtilis PX573 grown in CSL medium supplemented with different trace elements at 37oC and 200 rpm after 72h of fermentation.\nCulture conditions\t[Recovered biosurfactants] (mg/l)\nControl\t2361.6\nB.C\t2280.5\nB.E\t2085.4\nB.H\t2062.7\nSeveral researchers showed that in some cases the optimal concentration determined individually for each trace element could not be the optimal for the biosurfactants production when all the trace elements are present in the culture medium [106]. Specifically, the results reported by Wei et al. [106] suggest an interaction between the metal ions in terms of their effects on biosurfactants production. Therefore, in the current work, after determining the best concentration of each element, the interaction between them and their effect on biosurfactants production was further explored. Four combinations of the three metal ions at their optimal individual concentration were evaluated: conditions B.J (Fe2+ and Mg2+), B.K (Fe2+ and Mn2+), B.L (Mg2+ and Mn2+), and B.M (Fe2+, Mg2+ and Mg2+) (Table 9, Materials and Methods section). From Figure 9 it can be seen that the best results regarding surface tension decrease were obtained in the first 24h. The combination of trace elements was found to be more effective in the surface tension reduction then the elements themselves. The four conditions tested showed quite similar behaviors, as demonstrated by the ST-1 values in the first 24h, B.J: 31.6 mN/m, B.K: 31.5 mN/m, B.L: 31.3 mN/m and B.M: 31.3 mN/m. However, only slight decreases of the surface tension could be observed comparing with the control (36.3 mN/m). The statistical analysis showed that the differences between the control and the different combinations of trace elements were not significant (pvalue >0.05).\n59\n60\n3.2.4\tPseudomonas aeruginosa PX112\n- Optimization of culture conditions\nAs previously mentioned, several environmental factors, such as aeration, can influence the bacterial cell growth and/or the biosurfactant production [3, 55, 128]. Therefore, in the current work the aeration conditions that maximize the biosurfactants production by P. aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium were studied (from 100 to 180 rpm). Figure 10 shows that a maximum biomass concentration is reached after 48h using 180 rpm, in contrast with the previous results using 100 rpm (Figure 5), in which the maximum biomass concentration was reached later. Furthermore, it was found that this biomass concentration corresponds to the lowest surface tension (34.1 mN/m) and highest E24 (60 %) values obtained. After 48h, a strong decrease in the biomass concentration was observed, which corresponds to cellular death. Nevertheless, the surface tension and emulsification index values remained constant until the end of the fermentation (120h), i.e. these results suggest that no biosurfactant degradation occurred until the end of the fermentation. At the end of the fermentation, the biosurfactants present in the culture medium were recovered by acid precipitation and were further freeze-dried. The biosurfactant concentration at this time point was 1596.6 mg/l, which represents a great increase of biosurfactant production, i.e. 12 times higher than the concentration obtained in the fermentation conducted at 100 rpm (136.1 mg/l).\nTime (h)\n61\ni. Alternative culture media\nThe initial screening tests showed that P aeruginosa PX112 produced high amounts of biosurfactants in LB medium. Therefore, aiming at reducing the production costs, an alternative media based in industrial wastes, specifically molasses and CSL, was studied.\nThe production of biosurfactants was performed in CSLM medium at 37oC and 180 rpm and evaluated through surface tension and emulsification indexes measurements (Figure 11). The lowest surface tension value, 30.3 mN/m, was observed at 72h (Figure 11A). In the case of the emulsifying activity, the E24-1 and E24-2 values increased until the end of the fermentation (144h), meaning that the biosurfactant is being continuously produced. The medium CSLM itself (control) showed a very high emulsifying activity (E24=60 %), therefore we cannot conclude that the E24 values determined in the supernatant along the fermentation are due to the production of biosurfactants, but most probably correspond to other medium components that also exhibit emulsifying activity. For instance, in the first 24h it was observed a decrease in the E24 values probably due to the consumption of such medium components. However, regarding the E24-1 values, a decrease was observed in the first 24h (to 0 %), after which an increase was observed and this increase could be due to biosurfactant production since those medium components must have been already exhausted. At 120h, the E24-1 values reached their maximum (equal to the E24 value). At the end of fermentation, the biosurfactants present in the culture medium supernatant were recovered by acid precipitation and were further freeze-dried. The concentration of biosurfactants was 4076.6 mg/l, corresponding to a concentration 2.5 times higher than the one obtained using the LB medium.\n62\nFigure 11. Profiles of the culture both supernatant surface tension (mN/m) (A) and emulsification index (E24, %) (B) during the time course of the fermentation by P. aeruginosa PX112. The strain was grown on CSLM medium at 37oC and 180 rpm. Results represent the average of two measurements \u00b1 SD.\nBased on the positive results obtained for biosurfactants production using the alternative media CSLM, a second optimization of the process was conducted, namely regarding the agitation rate that was increased from 180 to 200 rpm (Figure 12). Similarly to the results obtained at 180 rpm, the most interesting results obtained for 200 rpm were a surface tension value of 31.5 mN/m and an E24 of 60 % at 72h of fermentation. These values remained approximately constant until de end of fermentation (144h).\n63\nFigure 12. Profiles of the culture both supernatant surface tension (mN/m) (A) and emulsification index (E24, %) (B) during the time course of the fermentation by P. aeruginosa PX112. The strain was grown on CSLM medium at 37oC and 200 rpm. Results represent the average of two measurements \u00b1 SD.\nThe biosurfactants produced under a higher agitation rate were recovered at 96 and 120h (Table 17). A higher biosurfactant production was recovered after 120h of fermentation. The amount of biosurfactant produced at 200 rpm was also found to be higher than the amount previously obtained for 180 rpm, although the surface tension and emulsification indexes obtained were similar in both cases.\nTable 17. Biosurfactants concentration (mg/l) along the time. Biosurfactants were produced by P. aeruginosa PX122 in CSLM medium at 37oC and 200 rpm.\nTime (h)\n96\t120\n[Recovered biosurfactants] (mg/l)\t4270.3\n5185.4\n64\nThere is a great variety of low cost substrates that have been described in literature and could be used for the production of rhamnolipids by P. aeruginosa strains. Mercade et al. [129] evaluated the potential use of olive oil mill effluent (OOME) for the production of rhamnolipids. In Mediterranean countries, such as Portugal, the OOME is a major pollutant of the agricultural industry being produced in large quantities [130], therefore this substrate could also be a suitable choice for our study. The biosurfactants produced with this substrate (6.4 g/l) reduced the surface tension from 42 to 30 mN/m [130]. Furthermore, Patel and Desai [131] described the use of renewable water-soluble by-products (molasses, corn steep liquor) to produce rhamnolipids from P. aeruginosa GS3. Benincasa et al. [132] evaluated a number of water-immiscible substrates in mineral medium, namely sunflower (4.9 g/l biosurfactant), soybean (4.8 g/l biosurfactant), olive oil (5.3 g/l biosurfactant). The results obtained in the current study (Table 17) are in good agreement with previous reports from the literature.\nii. Effect of trace elements\nAs previously mentioned, in this work, the composition of trace elements in the medium was optimized. In order to define the optimal concentration of metal ions, Fe2+ (conditions P.A, P.B and P.C), Mn2+ (conditions P.D, P.E and P.F) and Mg2+ (conditions P.G, P.H and P.I), several shake flasks with CSLM medium were inoculated with P. aeruginosa PX112 and supplemented with different concentration of these elements (Table 8, Materials and Methods section). As can be seen in Figure 13, the conditions P.C, P.D and P.F showed a slightly higher reduction of surface tension, mainly in the first 72h, when compared to the other conditions tested. However, analyzing the ST-2 values at 72h of fermentation (Figure 13C), for the conditions P.C (46.8 mN/m), P.D (46.3 mN/m) and P.F (46.0 mN/m) it was possible to see that they were quite similar to the control (46.6 mN/m), thus no further improvement of the biosurfactant could be observed under those conditions.\n65\n66\niii.\tImprovement of biosurfactants recovery\nThe total amount of biosurfactants being recovered at the end of fermentation is highly influenced by the recovery technique used. In this work, we also aimed at exploring other techniques that could lead to a maximum biosurfactant recovery and at the same time that are simple to perform and inexpensive.\nAcid precipitation is one of the methods commonly used to recover biosurfactants. However, in the case of the biosurfactants from P aeruginosa PX112, the surface tension values of the supernatants after biosurfactants recovery indicated that only a small fraction was being recovered. Therefore, as a first approach, different times of acid precipitation were studied. From Table 18 it can be seen that the higher concentration of biosurfactants recovered (710 mg/l) was obtained after 1 day of acid precipitation. The extension of the exposure time to acid conditions did not show a positive effect in the total amount of biosurfactant being recovered.\nThe surface tension values of the supernatant (Table 18), before and after acid precipitation, were found to be similar, thus meaning that the biosurfactants recovered represent just a small fraction of the existing surface active compounds in the medium supernatant.\nTable 18. Effect of different acid precipitation times on the amount of biosurfactant recovered. Surface tension values (mN/m) of supernatants before and after acid precipitation, and the concentration of recovered biosurfactants (mg/l). The supernatants were obtained by growing P aeruginosa PX112 at 37oC and 180 rpm for 120h. The control surface tension (LB medium) was ST=49.4 mN/m, ST-1=62.2 mN/m and ST-2 =69.3 mN/m. The supernatant after acid precipitation corresponds to the liquid obtained after centrifugation and removal of the precipitated biosurfactants. Results represent the average of two measurements \u00b1 SD.\nSupernatant\tSurface Tension (mN/m)\t\t\tBiosurfactant recovered (mg/l)\n\tST\tST-1\tST-2\t\nBefore acid precipitation\t32.5 \u00b1 0.4\t41.2 \u00b1 0.1\t66.1 \u00b1 0.6\t-\nAfter acid precipitation\t\t\t\t\n1 day\t33.0 \u00b1 0.0\t43.9 \u00b1 0.1\t66.1 \u00b1 1.2\t710\n4 days\t32.0 \u00b1 0.0\t41.2 \u00b1 0.4\t64.0 \u00b1 1.3\t450\n11days\t-\t-\t-\t400 \u00b1 20\n67\nsecondary recovery methods to be applied after the acid precipitation is required to assure a maximum recovery of biosurfactants. In this work, the recovery of biosurfactants by extraction with solvents (chloroform and a mixture of chloroform:methanol:butanol (1:1:1 v/v/v)) and by precipitation with ammonium sulfate (40 % (w/v)) were evaluated. The analysis of the surface tension values of the supernatant after biosurfactants recovery was generally found to be increased; especially after the precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Therefore, most of the methods studied were showed to be more efficient as compared to the sole use of acid precipitation. This conclusion is supported by the results on the concentration of recovered biosurfactants shown on Table 19. Although the surface tension values were lower for the freeze-dried biosurfactants recovered by chloroform extraction (29.4 mN/m) than the ones recovered by ammonium sulfate precipitation (32.5 mN/m), the concentration of these biosurfactants (4.45 mg/ml) was 2.3 times higher as compared to the chloroform extraction (1.93 mg/ml). Regarding the extraction with chloroform, a second subsequent extraction was performed, but in this case no further biosurfactants could be recovered. In the case of the mixture of chloroform:methanol:butanol was not possible recover the biosurfactants, i.e the mixture was not efficient. The optimization of the biosurfactants recovery procedure allowed an increase of 6.3 times of the amount of biosurfactants recovered by ammonium sulfate precipitation as compared with sole use of acid precipitation (standard methodology). Therefore, the results showed that the use of both recovery techniques together (acid precipitation flowed by ammonium sulfate precipitation) will improve the amount of biosurfactants being recovered, thus making the process more efficient.\nTable 19. Different methods for the recovery of biosurfactants produced in LB medium by P. aeruginosa PX112. Concentration of the biosurfactant recovered (mg/l), surface tension values (mN/m) of supernatants after being subjected to different recovery methods (control (LB medium): ST=49.4 mN/m and ST-1 =62.2 mN/m)) and of freeze-dried biosurfactant (concentration 1.25 mg/ml) (control PBS: ST=71.9 mN/m).

The results gathered in Table 20 show that the biosurfactants recovery with ammonium sulfate is more efficient comparing to the chloroform extraction, similarly to the previous findings with LB medium. Specifically, although the surface tension values (28 mN/m) for the freeze-dried biosurfactants recovered by chloroform extraction were lower than the ones obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation, the amount of biosurfactants recovered was higher when ammonium sulfate precipitation was used (10 times). In conclusion, together with the biosurfactants recovered by ammonium sulfate precipitation it may exist also a great amount of impurities, thus leading to higher surface tension values.\nTable 20.

However, when a complex carbon source is used, such as molasses or CSL, the downstream recovery of biosurfactants is a delicate step because of the similar polarity of the product and the substrate components [133]. Therefore, the combination of acid precipitation with another recovery technique as suggested in the current study could be helpful in reducing the presence of impurities in the crude biosurfactant and in improving the biosurfactant yields. Banat [134] also suggested the use of two combined methods to recover rhamnolipids from P aeruginosa, namely acidification of culture media followed by extraction with chloroform/methanol.\n69\n3.3.\tBiosurfactants characterization\nOne of the issues in any new biosurfactant production process is the fact that in the end a crude biosurfactant mixture is obtained and the downstream processes usually retrieve very low yields and sometimes are inefficient. As a consequence, the characterization of the pure molecules is hard and sometimes not feasible. Nevertheless, it is important for several reasons, e.g. to improve the recovery but also the production, to know the structures or at least the functional groups that are involved in these biosurfactant mixtures. On the other hand, it is of utmost important to have a functional characterization of the biosurfactants since this will open application opportunities.\n3.3.1.\tTLC characterization\nThe freeze-dried biosurfactants recovered from all isolates under study were characterized by TLC. Two different mobile phases were tested: (a) chloroform-methanol-water (65:25:4 v/v/v) and (b) acetonitrile-water (6:3 v/v). The mobile phase (b) was the most efficient, being able to separate more components from the biosurfactants mixture produced by lactic acid bacteria. Different solvents were used to dissolve the freeze-dried biosurfactants. Methanol and acetonitrile were not able to dissolve completely the biosurfactants; however, all of them were soluble in PBS buffer, thus demonstrating their dominant hydrophilic character. Table 21 summarizes the results obtained for the seven isolates studied. L. paracasei A20, L. agi/is CCUG31450 and L. anima/is ATCC35046 show a few Rf values that are quite similar (in bold), which suggests that these biosurfactants might have some structural similarities. However, despite some similar Rf values, in general, the different biosurfactants showed distinct Rf profiles, meaning that different structures are present in the biosurfactant mixtures (it is important to notice that these biosurfactants have not been purified).\n70\nTable 21. TLC analysis of the crude biosurfactants recovered from the seven isolates studied. Solvent system used was acetonitrile-water (6:3 v/v). The freeze-dried biosurfactants were dissolved in PBS.

As described in the literature, the most important interfacial properties (as detergency and solubilization) are affected by the existence of micelles in solution [35]. Therefore, the CMC is widely used as an index to evaluate the surface activity of a given surfactant. At biosurfactant concentrations higher than the CMC, the surface tension becomes stable, and there no further significant reduction of the surface tension will occur. The results showed, as expected, a progressive decrease in surface tension values with the increase of the biosurfactants concentration.\n71\ni. Lactobacillus agi/is CCUG31450\nfor those produced in CWM (Figure 14B) with a minimum surface tension value of 47.5 mN/m. The lowest CMC value for L. agi/is CCUG31450 biosurfactants was obtained with the standard medium and not with the alternative. Moreover, this biosurfactants produced in MRS medium were able to reduce the surface tension more effectively than the ones produced in CWM. The effectiveness is defined as the minimum value to which the surface tension value can be reduced, whereas efficiency is defined by the surfactant concentration required to produce a significant reduction in the surface tension of water, i.e. the CMC [35].\nFigure 14. Critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant produced by L. agih'sCCUG31450 in MRS medium (A), or in CWM (B) at 100 rmp. The plot represents surface tension (mN/m) of crude biosurfactants versus logarithm of biosurfactant concentration. The CMC was determined from the intersection of the regression lines better describe the two parts of the curve, below and above the CMC. The reference surface tension value was 71.9 mN/m. Results represent the average of two measurements and error bars represent SD of the mean values.\n72\nRegarding the biosurfactant from L rhamnosus CCM1825, the highest decrease of surface tension was registered within the range from 6.0 to 4.5 g/l, namely 43.6 and 45.4 mN/m, respectively. For L. ferment 126 the most pronounced decrease in surface tension ranges from 45.1 to 46.3 mN/m for a concentration of 9.0 and 6.0 g/l, respectively [135]. As can be seen, the CMC values for the biosurfactants produced by L. agi/is CCUG31450 in MRS are quite similar to the ones obtained with the biosurfactants from L. rhamnosus CCM1825 and L. ferment 126. Moreover, these values were found to be even lower than the ones reported for S thermophilus A biosurfactant, 20 g/l [101]. Nevertheless, Gudina et al. [112] reported for L. paracasei sbsp. paracasei A20 a quite lower value of CMC (2.5 mg/ml) corresponding to a surface tension value of 41.8 mN/m.\nThe CMC values herein found for L. agi/isCCUG31450 biosurfactants are in good agreement with previous values reported in the literature. It is important to notice that the biosurfactants studied in the current study were not as pure as the ones described by other authors; nevertheless it seems that the dialysis process used after recovery is efficient in the removal of impurities. On the other hand, the biosurfactants produced in CWM showed a much lower efficiency, this could be justified by the presence of impurities.\nii. Bacillus subtil is PX573\nBoth biosurfactant mixtures produced by B subti/is PX573 in LB and CSL medium were tested at different concentrations. The CMC was found to be 250 mg/l for the biosurfactant produced in LB medium (Figure 15A), with a minimum surface tension value of 32.6 mN/m; and 160 mg/l for the biosurfactant produced in CSL medium (Figure 15B), with a minimum surface tension value of 29.9 mN/m. Contrarily to was observed for L. agi/is CCUG31450, for this strain the results suggest that the biosurfactant produced in the low cost medium CSL is able to reduce the surface tension more effectively than the one produced in LB medium.\n73\nFigure 15. Critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant produced by B. subtilis PX573 in LB medium without shaking (A), or in CSL medium at 200 rpm (B). The plot represents surface tension (mN/m) of crude biosurfactants versus logarithm of biosurfactant concentration. The CMC was determined from the intersection of the regression lines that better describe the two parts of the curve, below and above CMC. The reference surface tension value was 71.9 mN/m. Results represent the average of two measurements and error bars represent SD of the mean values.\nSurfactin, the main biosurfactant produced by B subtilis, is the most effective biosurfactant known so far, being able to decrease the surface tension of water from 72 to 26 - 30 mN/m [127, 136]. Different CMC values have been reported for surfactin by several authors. Vaz et al. [35] reported a CMC of 40 mg/l for biosurfactants produced by B subtilis EG1 in LB medium, with a minimum surface tension value of 29.0 mN/m. Similarly, Arutchelvi et al. [137] showed that crude surfactin produced by B subtilis YB7 reduced the surface tension of water from 72 to 30 mN/m with a CMC of 40 mg/l. Nitschke and Pastore [70] reported for the biosurfactant from B subtilis LB5a a minimum surface tension of 26.6 mN/m and a CMC of 33 mg/l. Cooper et al. [10] reported\n74\na CMC of 25 mg/l and a minimum surface tension of 27.0 mN/m for surfactin from B subtilis strains. Pereira et al. [138] also described the CMC values obtained for different B subtilis isolates: 20 mg/l for isolates #309 and #311; and 30 mg/l for isolate #573. These authors concluded that biosurfactants produced by isolates #309 and #311 were more efficient than the ones produced by isolate #573, which explained why the isolate #573, although producing higher amounts of biosurfactant, provided similar or higher (i.e. less active surfactant) surface tension values.\nIn our study, the characterization of the biosurfactants produced by B subtilis PX573 in different media showed similar reductions of the PBS surface tension, from 71.9 to 32.9 mN/m (biosurfactants produced in LB medium), and from 71.9 to 29.9 mN/m (biosurfactants produced in CSL medium). These results were found to be in accordance with the above mentioned studies. In contrast, the CMC values obtained herein are substantially higher when compared with the ones referred in literature. These differences are largely due to the purity of biosurfactants since no purification process was conducted.\nAs previously mentioned, B subtilis PX573 produced higher amounts of biosurfactants in CSL than in LB medium showing a slightly higher reduction of the PBS surface tension and a higher efficiency, as seen by the lower CMC value. Although the biosurfactants produced in CSL medium exhibited a higher efficiency it is necessary to confirm if the biosurfactants obtained from different media display the same activity, such as antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and capacity to recovery oil. The evaluation of such activities will be discussed further in the sub-section 3.4 (Biosurfactants applications).\niii.\tPseudomonas aeruginosa PX112\nThe biosurfactants produced by P. aeruginosa PX112 in both LB and CSLM media were tested at different concentrations. The CMC was found to be 1250 mg/l for the biosurfactants produced in LB medium (Figure 16A) with a minimum surface tension value of 33.9 mN/m; and 650 mg/l for the biosurfactants produced in CSLM medium (Figure 16) with a minimum surface tension value of 30.2 mN/m. Similarly to the previous results for B subtilis PX573, the biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112 were also found to have higher CMC values in LB medium as compared to CSLM. Specifically, the CMC of the biosurfactants produced in CSLM medium was\n75\n76\nfound to be 2 times lower than the ones produced in LB. These results also indicate that the biosurfactants produced in CSLM medium are able to reduce the surface tension more effectively.\nFigure 16. Critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant produced by P. aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium at 100 rpm (A), or in CSLM medium at 200 rpm (B). In both cases, the biosurfactants were recovered by acid precipitation. The plot represents surface tension (mN/m) of crude biosurfactants versus logarithm of biosurfactant concentration. The CMC was determined from the intersection of the regression lines that better describe the two parts of the curve, below and above CMC. The reference surface tension value was 71.9 mN/m. Results represent the average of two measurements and error bars represent SD of the mean values.\nnature of the rhamnolipid and its producer [133, 139]. In particular, the variability of the CMC values for pure rhamnolipids and its mixtures greatly depends on the chemical composition of the various types of rhamnolipids and also on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio of the rhamnolipids constituting the crude biosurfactant [140, 141]. For instance, Nitschke et al. [130] described a CMC value of 5 mg/l for the di-rhamnolipid Rha2CioCio that was lower than the CMC value determined for RhaCioCio (40 mg/l) and for the species more hydrophilic (RhaCio and Rha2Cio) which showed CMC values of 200 mg/l [142, 143]. Besides, the differences in CMC values could also be related with the presence of impurities [144] or to different microbial sources.\nSince the biosurfactants produced by P. aeruginosa PX112 did not undergo specific purification processes, the presence of impurities lead to increased CMC values as compared to the ones reported in the literature. Abdel-Mawgoud et al. [141] described the influence of impurities in the CMC value of rhamnolipids. In that study, the authors suggested that the low purity (25 %) of the tested rhamnolipid could be responsible for the difference observed in the CMC values comparing with standard rhamnolipids.\nMoreover, the interference of medium components on the CMC values has also been widely reported in the literature. Depending if the biosurfactant is from the culture supernatant, crude or purified, the CMC values could be different, in part due to the medium components that could interfere with micellization of biosurfactants, influencing positively or negatively the CMC values. Pornsunthorntawee et al. [99] showed that the crude biosurfactant produced by a P aeruginosa strain reduced the surface tension to 29.0 mN/m with a CMC of 200 mg/l. Furthermore, the authors showed that the CMC value for the biosurfactants present in the culture supernatant, free of cells (120 mg/l), was lower than that of the crude biosurfactant (200 mg/l), probably due to the impurities existent in the culture supernatant. In that study, the culture supernatant contained a small amount palmitic acid, which is able to interact with the biosurfactant molecules, thus affecting the micellization. Therefore, the micellization could occur more easily, leading to a CMC value of the culture supernatant lower than that of the extracted biosurfactant [99]. This study clearly showed that CMC values are strongly affected by the medium components. In our study, and as previously mentioned, the lower CMC values obtained for the biosurfactants produced in CSLM could be due to some medium components that might precipitate or sediment during the recovery process. Accordingly, these biosurfactants could have different properties comparing to the ones produced in LB.\n77\nDespite of the biosurfactants produced in CSLM medium exhibited a more pronounced efficiency it is required to confirm if the biosurfactants obtained from distinct media display the same activity, such as antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and capacity to recovery oil. The evaluation of such activities will be discussed further in the sub-section 3.4 (Biosurfactants applications).\n3.3.3.\tBiosurfactants stability\nThe applicability of biosurfactants in several fields greatly depends on their stability at different temperatures, salinities and pH values.\ni. Lactobacillus agi/is CCUG31450\nIn this case, as the biosurfactants are cell-bound, a biosurfactant solution in distilled water was prepared at a concentration of 7.5 mg/ml (CMC value) using the biosurfactants produced in MRS medium. The pH of the biosurfactants solution was changed from 2.0 to 13.0 and the surface tension and emulsification indexes were measured. As illustrated in Figure 17A, both acid and alkaline conditions led to a slight decrease of the surface and emulsifying activity. The most favorable conditions regarding surface tension and emulsification index were observed at pH 7.0.\nThe effect of salts on the biosurfactant activity was evaluated. From Figure 17B it can be seen that these biosurfactants, mainly their emulsifying activity, were affected by NaCl concentrations higher than 50 g/l.\n78\nStudy of biosurfactants \u201ccocktails\u201d with enhanced properties |\nA\nB\nNaCl (g/l)\nFigure 17. Effect of pH (A) and salinity (B) on the stability of the biosurfactants isolated from L agHis CCUG31450 in MRS medium. Surface tension values (mN/m) and emulsification indexes (E24, %) obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants dissolved in PBS (pH 7.0) at 7.5 mg/ml under different pH values and NaCl concentrations. Measurements were conducted at room temperature. Results represent the average of two measurements and error bars represent the SD.\nRegarding the biosurfactants stability to an extreme temperature, no negative effect was observed (Table 22), i.e. the biosurfactants produced by L. agi/is CCUG31450 preserved their emulsifying and surface activities.\n79\nTable 22. Effect of high temperature on the stability of the biosurfactants isolated from L. agilisCCUG31450 in MRS medium. Surface tension values (mN/m) and emulsification indexes (E24, %) were obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants dissolved in PBS (pH 7.0) at a concentration of 7.5 mg/ml before and after exposure to 121oC for 20 min. Results represent the average of two measurements \u00b1 SD.\n\tBefore treatment\tAfter treatment\nSurface Tension (mN/m)\t43.4 \u00b1 0.2\t43.4 \u00b1 0.6\nE24 (%)\t60\t60\nGudina et al. [112] analyzed the sensitivity of the biosurfactants produced by L. paracasei sbsp. paracasei A20 to different values of pH. The surface activity of the crude biosurfactants remained relatively stable between pH 6.0 and 10.0, with a higher stability at alkaline conditions. Similarly, in the current work the L. agi/isCCUG31450 biosurfactants were more stable in the same pH range, although some instability was found for pH 2.0 and 13.0 at which surface tension values was about five units higher than at pH 7.0.\nThe instability of the biosurfactants produced by some lactobacilli mainly in acidic conditions has been previously described by other researchers, and has been related to the presence of negative charged groups at the polar ends of the molecules which are protonated under those conditions [112]. The characterization of the intracellular biosurfactants produced by some lactobacilli has revealed the presence of proteic fractions probably associated to phosphate groups [112], which could also be negatively affected by the denaturalization at acidic pH. Accordingly, in our work, for pH values lower than 6.0, precipitation of some of the biosurfactant components was observed contributing to an increase of the surface tension.\nRegarding the experiments conducted with different NaCl concentrations, it was found that surface tension did not suffer any pronounced change with increasing NaCl concentrations, the variations observed were very small, from 43.4 mN/m (control) to 46.3 mN/m (corresponding to the higher concentration of NaCl tested) (Figure 17A). On the other hand, the emulsifying activity is highly affected by salinity, as can be seen (Figure 17B) a NaCl concentration higher than 50 g/l lead to an abrupt loss of emulsifying activity.\n80\nii. Bacillus subtil is PX573\nThe pH of the culture broth supernatants obtained at the end of the fermentation (LB medium, without shaking, 48h) was changed from 2.0 to 13.0 and the surface tension and emulsification indexes were measured. The results in Figure 18A show that the biosurfactant activity was retained in the pH range of 6.0-13.0 with a minimum deviation in surface tension and emulsification indexes. The minimum surface tension value was observed at pH 6.0 (30.4 mN/m) and the higher emulsification index at pH 13.0 (46 %). Below pH 6.0 the surface tension increased and no emulsification activity could be observed, probably due to the biosurfactant precipitation. Therefore, it could be established that biosurfactants produced by B subti/is PX573 in LB medium exhibited a higher stability at alkaline than acidic conditions.\nRegarding the effect of salinity on the biosurfactant activity, the culture broth supernatant obtained at the end of the fermentation was supplemented with different NaCl concentrations, ranging from 50 to 200 g/l. Both surface tension and emulsifying activity were measured (Figure 18B). The highest emulsification index (44 %) and surface tension reduction (31.8 mN/m) were reached at 50 g/l NaCl. The biosurfactant activity was not affected by NaCl concentrations up to 50 g/l. The behavior of biosurfactants at 50 g/l of NaCl is similar to the control (without NaCl), thus demonstrating that this biosurfactant is stable at increasing concentrations of salt.\n81\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\npH\n50\nz\n45\no\n'35\nc o I-\no o ra H\u2014\nra\nL.\n3 v>\n55\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\nB\nNaCl (g/l)\nFigure 18.

Results represent the average of three independent measurements and error bars represent the SD.\nTo study the stability of biosurfactants at high temperatures, the culture broth supernatants obtained at the end of fermentation were incubated at 121 oC for 20 min. Surface tension and emulsification indexes were measured before and after heating. From Table 23, it can be seen the high temperatures do not negatively influence the biosurfactant properties.\n82\nTable 23. Effect of high temperature on the stability of biosurfactants produced by B subtilis PX573 in LB medium.

[127] reported a higher stability of biosurfactants produced by B subtilis strains at alkaline conditions, specifically in pH values ranging from 6.0 to 12.0. The maximum activity was observed at pH of 7.0. At pH 2.0 and 4.0, they observed higher surface tension values, since these biosurfactants are not soluble at such acidic conditions and they tend to precipitate. They also described that acidic conditions promote structural distortions in the precipitated biosurfactants that leads to loss of their capability of reducing surface tension. This effect could likewise explain why the biosurfactants produced by B subtilis PX573 precipitated at acidic conditions.\nThe biosurfactants produced by B subtilis PX573 in the current work showed a good surface and emulsifying activity under extreme conditions of temperature, thus these results are in accordance with the ones described in the literature. Furthermore, Al-Bahry et al. [127] tested the B subtilis B20 biosurfactants stability over a wide range of temperatures (40 - 100oC for 60 min; 121 oC for 20 min) and could not found relevant changes in the surface tension, thus demonstrating the biosurfactants stability. Additionally, four different Bacilli isolates were reported to produce biosurfactants that were stable for nine days at 80oC [76, 145]. Desai and Banat [3] observed that heat treatment of some biosurfactants caused no considerable changes in their properties even after autoclaving them at 120oC for 15 min.\nThe analysis of the biosurfactants stability to different NaCl concentrations was also studied by Gudina et al. [103]. Their results are similar to the ones obtained in this work, showing the minimum surface tension value at 50 g/l NaCl. Other authors, namely Yakimov et al. [146], Abdel-Mawgoud et al. [147] and Ghojavand et al. [148], also reported similar results.\n83\nobtained for the biosurfactant (at a concentration of 1000 mg/l) was found to be similar to those obtained for the commercial chemical surfactants, except for Findet\u00ae1214N/23 for which the surface tension values were slightly higher. Therefore, it can be assumed that the surface activity of that biosurfactant is comparable to the commercial products and it is stable at extreme temperature conditions. On the other hand, the commercial chemical surfactants were found to be more stable to pH changes as compared to the biosurfactant over the whole range of pH values studied. In this study, the authors suggested that the instability of the biosurfactant to acidic pH was probably due to the presence of proteinaceous contaminants. Nevertheless, it is important to notice that above pH 5.0 the biosurfactant showed a better surface activity than the chemical ones.\nThe biosurfactants produced by B. subti/is PX573 showed a similar stability to the biosurfactants described by Vaz et al. [35]. Therefore, these biosurfactants could also represent a viable alternative to the chemical surfactants used in a number of applications.\nIn summary, the B. subti/is PX573 biosurfactants were found to be stable to heat treatement and over a wide range of pH values, which together with their excellent surface and emulsifying activities, make them suitable candidates to be used in bioremediation of contaminated sites and in the petroleum industry (MEOR), in which extreme conditions commonly prevail [149].\niii.\tPseudomonas aeruginosa PX112\nThe same experimental setup was used as described above. Figure 19A shows that the biosurfactant activity was retained at pH values between 2.0 and 5.0. Contrarily to the biosurfactants produced by B. subti/isPX573, the ones produced by P aeruginosa PX112 exhibited a higher stability at acid than at alkaline conditions, showing a minimum surface tension value (30.8 mN/m) at pH 4.0 and 5.0. On the other hand, the emulsifying activity was found to be more stable at alkaline conditions, with a maximum emulsification index (61 %) being obtained for pH values of 7.0 and 8.0. The biosurfactants produced by P aeruginosa PX112 were found to be highly stable to acid conditions, which explain why the acid precipitation is not efficient for the complete removal of the biosurfactant present in the culture supernatants.\n84\nbiosurfactants produced by P. aeruginosa PX112 were found to be very stable in conditions with high salinity.\nA\nB\nNaCl (g/l)\nFigure 19. Effect of pH (A) and salinity (B) on the stability of biosurfactants produced by P. aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium. Surface tension values (mN/m) and emulsification indexes (E24, %) were obtained with the culture broth supernatants at different pH values and NaCl concentrations. Results represent the average of three independent measurements and error bars represent the SD.\nThe stability of these biosurfactants at high temperatures was also investigated. Culture broth supernatants obtained at the end of fermentation were incubated at 121oC for 20 min. Results gathered in Table 24 showed no negative effect in the biosurfactant properties with the temperature increase.\n85\nTable 24. Effect of a high temperature on the stability of the biosurfactants produced by P aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium. Surface tension values (mN/m) and emulsification indexes (E24, %) were obtained with the culture broth supernatants before and after exposure to 121 oC for 20 min. Values represent the average of three independent experiments \u00b1 SD.\n\tRoom Temperature\t121oC\nSurface Tension (mN/m)\t34.0 \u00b1 0.35\t33.5 \u00b1 0.52\nE24 (%)\t60.7 \u00b1 1.15\t59.3 \u00b1 3.06\nRhamnolipids, produced by P aeruginosa, have been widely studied regarding their stability in order to find novel applications in which extreme conditions are commonly used. Abel-Mawgoud et al. [141] reported that the rhamnolipids surface activity was stable over a wide range of pH values (from 2 to 13) with a maximum surface activity reached at pH 7.0 to 8.0. Pirollo et al. [150] also reported that the P aeruginosa LBI rhamnolipids surface activity remained unaltered over a broad pH range (from 5 to 10). In the pH range tested, the biosurfactants herein produced by P aeruginosa PX112 also showed a small variation in surface activity from 30.9 to 34.5 mN/m.\nGiven the stability to salts herein found for P aeruginosa biosurfactants, these can be considered as suitable candidates to be applied in the bioremediation of contaminated marine environments where high salinities prevail.\nMoreover, the exposure of these biosurfactants to a high temperature did not have a negative impact on the surface and emulsifying activities. These results showed to be in agreement with other studies reported about rhamnolipids stability. In particular Mohammad et al. [141] observed an exceptional stability of the rhamnolipids at high temperatures (heating at 100\u00b0C for 1h and autoclaving at 121oC for 10 min). Similarly, Borodoli and Konwar [151] exposed the P aeruginosa biosurfactants to 100oC for different time periods, and found that their activity remained unaffected. In the same way, the rhamnolipids from P aeruginosa LBI were reported to exhibit a good stability when heated [150]. Similarly to the biosurfactants produced by L. agiiisCCUG31450 and B subtilis PX573, the ones produced by P aeruginosa PX112 also showed a good stability to high temperatures.\n86\nPX112 biosurfactants, similarly to the rhamnolipids tested by Lovaglio et al. [152], could replace chemical surfactants in different industrial fields, in which extreme conditions are used.\n3.3.4.\tChemical characterization\nIn order to have a preliminary chemical characterization of the components present in the biosurfactant mixture produced in MRS medium by L. agi/is CCUG31450, the protein and carbohydrates concentration was determined. The results gathered in Table 25 show that this biosurfactant has 10 times more carbohydrates than proteins.\nTable 25. Chemical characterization of the biosurfactants produced by L agi/is CCUG31450 in MRS medium. Concentration of carbohydrates and protein were obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants dissolved in demineralized water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and expressed as %. Results represent the average of three measurements \u00b1 SD.\nBiosurfactants\t% Carbohydrates\t% Protein\nL agisCCUG31450\t33.0 \u00b1 3.0\t3.5 \u00b1 0.1\nThe biosurfactants produced by lactic acid bacteria have not been so widely studied compared to surfactin or rhamnolipids. The most well-known biosurfactants from lactic acid bacteria have been described as mixtures containing proteins and polysaccharides [101, 119, 153].\nIn this work, the content in carbohydrates and protein of the biosurfactants produced by L. agi/is CCUG31450 was also determined and it was found that they were mainly composed of carbohydrates. These results are similar to the ones reported for the biosurfactants produced by L. caseisubsp. rhamnosus 36 and L. caseisubsp. rhamnosusATCC7469T that possess a higher content in polysaccharides [119]. On the other hand, the biosurfactants from L. acidophilusRC14 and L. fermentum B54 appear to contain more protein than the ones from L. casei subsp. rhamnosus36 and L caseisubsp. rhamnosusATCC7469T and a lower content in polysaccharides [119].\n87\nIn summary, the biosurfactants produced by lactic acid bacteria may have the same components but their proportions seem to be very different depending on the producing strain. Therefore, the study of this biosurfactants by FTIR will clearly and elucidate the composition and structure of the biosurfactants produced by L. agi/isCCUG31450. For instance, a FTIR analysis of the biosurfactants from L. pentosusclearly indicated the presence of -OH and -NH groups, that are commonly present in glycoproteins. This type of biosurfactant structures was also proposed for the biosurfactants produced by L. iactisand L. paracasei[135]. Additionally, a glycolipid-like structure has previously been proposed for the biosurfactants produced by S', thermophiius [135].\nIt is important to notice that in this work L. agi/is CCUG31450 was also able to produce biosurfactants in CWM, and that differences in the CMC values comparing to the standard medium have been observed, which suggested differences in the biosurfactants composition. Golek et al. [153] showed interesting results regarding the influence of medium composition on the growth phase of L. casei8/4 and consequently on the biosurfactants composition, namely the ratios of protein and polysaccharides. The highest proportion of protein was noted for the case of surfaceactive compounds obtained using the MRS medium. In contrast, the highest proportion of polysaccharides was reported for biosurfactants synthesized by L. casei8/4 on a medium prepared from whey permeate enriched with mineral salts. The results obtained suggested that the chemical structures of the biosurfactants were not homogeneous and greatly depend on the culture medium used. Furthermore, it should be noted that some biosurfactants produced by lactic acid bacteria showed high contents of lipids in their composition. For instance, the biosurfactant produced by Lactobacillus deibrueckiiwas classified as a glycolipid showing a higher lipid content as compared to its composition in carbohydrates (30 %:70 % (w/w)) [154]. Therefore, the biosurfactants produced from CWM should also be characterized. Moreover, besides this preliminary characterization, further studies should be conducted to infer the lipid contents of the biosurfactants produced by L. agi/is CCUG31450.\n88\n3.4.\tBiosurfactants applications\n3.4.1.\tAntimicrobial activity\ni. Individual biosurfactants\nThe antimicrobial activity of the crude biosurfactants isolated from several lactic acid bacteria was determined by measuring the growth inhibition percentages obtained for several microorganisms. Table 26 shows that only the biosurfactants produced in MRS medium by L. anima/is ATCC35046, L. paracasei A20 and L. agi/is CCUG31450 have antimicrobial activity, specifically against S', aureus. The biosurfactants recovered from L. agi/is CCUG31450 were efficient against other two microorganisms, S. agalactiae and P. aeruginosa. In this last case, the effect in the microbial growth inhibition was smaller when compared with the one observed for S. aureus.\nAs mentioned before, the properties of the biosurfactants produced by the same microorganism can differ depending on the media in which they are produced. Therefore, the antimicrobial activity of L. agi/is CCUG31450 biosurfactants produced in MRS and CWM was evaluated. From Table 26, it is possible to observe a clear difference in the antimicrobial activity of the biosurfactants produced in different media. Indeed, the biosurfactants produced in CWM did not present any activity. Therefore, the results once more suggest that biosurfactants being produced in different media may have distinct activities and probably different structures. The biosurfactants produced in CWM presented a higher CMC value comparing to the standard medium, which could also explain why no antimicrobial activity could be observed\nThe biosurfactants produced by L. agi/isCCUG31450 in MRS medium were also tested at a lower concentration (2.5 mg/ml); however, no antimicrobial activity was observed.\n89\nTable 26. Antimicrobial activity of the biosurfactants isolated from different lactic acid bacteria in MRS medium against several pathogenic bacterial and yeast strains. Percentages of growth inhibition were obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants dissolved in LB medium at a concentration of 5mg/ml. Results represent the average of three experiments \u00b1 SD.

These biosurfactants showed a good antimicrobial activity against S agaiactiae (54.5 %) (Figure 20A), for the highest biosurfactant concentration tested (5 mg/ml). The antimicrobial activity against other microorganisms was lower, namely E co/i: 16.4 %, P. aeruginosa: 14.5 % and C. albicans: 10.4 %.\nThe biosurfactants produced by the same strain in CSL medium were also tested. A much stronger antimicrobial activity against all the microorganisms tested was found (Figure 20B). These biosurfactants showed antimicrobial activity against S aureus (48.0 %), and it is important to notice that such activity was not observed for the biosurfactants obtained from LB medium. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the biosurfactants produced by B. subtilis PX573 in CSL medium exhibited a higher antimicrobial activity than the ones produced in LB medium. As mentioned before, this can be due to the different compositions of the biosurfactants, but also to the fact that the biosurfactants produced in CSL medium are more efficient (as shown by the CMC value).\n90\nFigure 20. Antimicrobial activity of biosurfactants produced by B. subtilis PX573 in LB medium (A) and in CSL medium (B) against several pathogenic bacterial and yeast strains. Percentages of growth inhibition were obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants dissolved in LB medium at different concentrations. Results represent the average of three experiments and error bars represent the SD.\nThe biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium were found to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. Antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast C. albicans was demonstrated (Figure 21A). A slightly higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria was observed. Specifically, for S agaiactiae a complete growth inhibition was achieved even at the lowest biosurfactant concentration used.\n91\nFigure 21. Antimicrobial activity of biosurfactants produced by P aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium (A) or in CSLM medium (B) against several pathogenic bacterial and yeast strains. Percentages of growth inhibition were obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants dissolved in LB medium at different concentrations. Results represent the average of three experiments and error bars represent the SD.\nThese antimicrobial assays were also conducted with the biosurfactants produced by P aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium that were recovered by different strategies, in order to verify if the recovered biosurfactants showed the same activity independently of the recovery process. Comparing the results obtained for the biosurfactants recovered by acid precipitation (Figure 21A), chloroform extraction (Figure 22A), and ammonium sulfate precipitation (Figure 22B), clear differences could be observed in the antimicrobial activity, especially against E coii, S. aureus and C. albicans. These results revealed that the biosurfactants recovered by ammonium sulfate\n92\nprecipitation did not have any antimicrobial activity against E. coli and C. albicans, showing the smaller antimicrobial activity spectrum as compared to the biosurfactants recovered using other strategies.\nThe biosurfactants recovered by chloroform extraction at a concentration of 5.0 mg/ml showed the highest antimicrobial activity (56.1 %) against E coli, when compared with the ones recovered by acid precipitation (26.8 %), or by ammonium sulfate precipitation (0 %). All biosurfactants were effective against S', aureus, although the ones recovered by acid precipitation revealed an antimicrobial activity significantly lower (pvalue = 0.003) than the others. Again, the different activities observed for the biosurfactants recovered by different techniques support the hypothesis that these could have different structures and properties.\n93\nGhribi et al. [155] demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of biosurfactants produced by B subtilis SPB1 against several bacteria and fungi strains, some of which with multidrug-resistant profiles. Specifically, their biosurfactants were effective against S. aureus, a strain that is known to be resistant to at least two ^-lactams. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that these biosurfactants were more active against Gram-positive than against Gram-negative bacteria, and also showed an important antifungal activity, especially against C. albicans. Fernandes et al. [156] also studied the activity of B subtiiis R14 biosurfactants against multidrug-resistant bacteria. All strains were sensitive to the surfactants, in particular E faecaiis (Gram-positive bacteria). The activity against Gram-negative bacteria was lower comparing to Gram-positive ones. The B subtiiis C1 strain was described to produce a lipopeptide N1 which revealed antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive bacteria, including S aureus and Mycobacterium smegmats [157]. Similarly to these reports, the biosurfactants produced by B subtiiis PX573 in the current work showed a similar antimicrobial behavior, being more aggressive against Gram-positive (S aureus and S agaiactiae) than Gram-negative bacteria (E co//). Furthermore, the biosurfactants produced in CSL medium by this strain showed antifungal activity against C. albicans, which is in agreement with previous reports [155].\nRegarding the biosurfactants produced by P. aeruginosa strains also several studies have been conducted to infer their potential antimicrobial activity. Abalos et al. [88] showed that the rhamnolipids from P. aeruginosaAT10 were effective against Gram-negative (E coiiand A. faecaiis) and Gram-positive bacteria (S aureus and Clostridium perfringes). In general, the MIC (the minimum concentration of product to inhibit the growth of a microorganism) for Gram-positive bacteria was lower than for Gram-negative ones, demonstrating their high sensibility to rhamnolipids. The authors showed that these rhamnolipids were excellent antifungal agents against A. niger and Giiocadium virens. Haba et al. [133] evaluated the antimicrobial activity of P. aeruginosa 47T2 NCBIM40044 rhamnolipids. These rhamnolipids inhibited the growth of both Gram-positive (S epidermidis ATCC11228 and S aureus ATCC6538) and Gram-negative (E coii ATCC8739 and P. aeruginosa ATCC9027) bacteria. Moreover, these rhamnolipids were effective against C. albicansATCC10231 although the MIC value was much higher compared with the ones calculated for bacteria. Accordingly, in this work, the biosurfactants produced by P. aeruginosa PX112 exhibited potent antimicrobial and antifungal activities. These biosurfactants were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria (S. agalactiae and S. aureus) than against Gram-negative\n94\nones (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). Besides, although these biosurfactants showed antifungal activity against C. albicans this activity was less pronounced as compared to the activity against bacteria.\nGenerally speaking, cationic surfactants are the most toxic and have historically been used as antimicrobials, while anionic surfactants are less toxic but more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria, and non-ionic surfactants are often considered non-toxic [158]. Surfactin and rhamnolipids produced by B. subti/is and P aeruginosa strains, respectively, have been described as anionic surfactants [159, 160]. Therefore, the biosurfactants produced by B. subti/is PX573 (Figure 20) and P aeruginosa PX112 (Figure 21), which most probably are anionic biosurfactants, showed a higher antimicrobial activity again the Gram-positive strains, which is in agreement with was has been described before.\nDepending on the biosurfactants nature, the toxic effect on the microorganisms could be distinct. For instance, biosurfactants may exert toxic effects by causing membrane disruption leading to cellular lysis, by increasing the membrane permeability causing metabolite leakage, by altering the physical membrane structure or by disrupting protein conformations thus interfering with important membrane functions such as energy generation and transport. The response of a given microorganism to a biosurfactant will depend on a variety of factors such as cellular ultrastructure, capacity for biodegradation or efflux, biosurfactant concentration and bioavailability, and other environmental and culture conditions [158].\nThe biosurfactants produced by B. subtiiisstrains was found to incorporate into membranes at low concentrations and induce slow leakage due to changes in membrane ultrastructure [66]. Specifically, the incorporation of surfactin in the cell membrane induced pores promoting membrane permeabilization. This effect occurs because the biosurfactant interacts with the phospholipid acyl chains, resulting in considerable membrane fluidization. Similarly to what is observed for surfactin, rhamnolipids have also been reported to interact with the cell membrane [140]. Ortiz et al. [161] showed that di-rhamnolipids intercalate into the phosphatidylcholine bilayers and produce structural perturbations in the membrane which might affect its function. The biosurfactants disrupt cell membranes through the formation of a transient pore. The permeabilizing effects of rhamnolipids on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was also studied by Sotirova et al. [162]. These researchers hypothesized that rhamnolipids can act against bacteria by two different mechanisms. The biosurfactant forms molecular aggregates in the surface of the Gram-positive bacteria or could release lipopolysaccharides from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, thus leading to the formation of transmembrane pores as channels to the\n95\nperiplasm. In both cases it results in a modification of the cell permeability. In this study it was found that the biosurfactant PS produced by Pseudomonas sp. PS-17 promoted a higher release of proteins in B subtilis 168 cells compared with those of P aeruginosa, which confirmed the higher susceptibility of Gram-positive cells to the effect of the biosurfactant [162].\nThe mechanism of action of surfactin and rhamnolipids described above can also explain the antimicrobial effects observed in this work for the biosurfactants produced by B subtilis PX573 and P aeruginosa PX112.\nIf in one hand these biosurfactants produced by B subtilis and P aeruginosa strains have the capacity to interfere with the integrity of the membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, the same effect normally is not observed for Gram-negative bacteria. Hamounda et al. [163] postulated that the resistance of the Gram-negative bacteria may be attributable to its cell wall LPS [164] and their negative surface charge. Assuming that the biosurfactants produced by B subtilis PX573 and P aeruginosa PX112 have an anionic nature, they could also exert a repulsive effect against the Gramnegative bacteria. However, it is likely that more than a single mechanism is involved in the resistance observed.\nIn summary, the results showed that, in general, the individual biosurfactants exert a small or any antimicrobial activity against C. albicans. The resistance of yeast cells to biosurfactants is most likely due to its rigid cell wall structure [163], which prevents the biosurfactants penetration. In this work the biosurfactants with the most promising action against the yeast C. albicans were the ones produced by P aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium and by B subtilis PX573 in CSL, showing an antimicrobial activity of 34.9 and 18.1 %, respectively.\nii. Biosurfactants mixtures\nIn this task, different biosurfactants were mixed at different concentrations in a 1:1 proportion in order to evaluate their interaction and synergistic or antagonistic effect on the microorganisms tested. The interaction between biosurfactants is synergistic when their combined activity is greater than the additive effect of the single biosurfactants; the synergistic interaction allows the use of lower dosages and in some cases can extend the range of actuation [159].\n96\nThe first mixture tested was prepared with the biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112 in CSLM medium and biosurfactants from L. agiiisCCUG31450 in MRS medium. As can been seen in Figure 23, this mixture was able to completely inhibit the growth of S', agaiactiae, thus corresponding to a slight increase in the overall antimicrobial activity as compared to the individual biosurfactants performance. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the differences observed were significant (pvalue&lt;0.0001). In contrast, the mixture showed a strong negative interaction between the biosurfactants against S', aureus, demonstrated by the abrupt reduction of the overall antimicrobial activity. The mixture showed only 21.3 % of antimicrobial activity against S', aureus when compared with the biosurfactant produced by P. aeruginosa PX112 (94 %) at the same concentration.\nFigure 23. Antimicrobial activity of biosurfactant mixtures against several pathogenic bacterial and yeast strains. The mixtures were prepared at 1:1 proportion with freeze-dried biosurfactants recovered from P. aeruginosa PX112 (produced in CSLM medium) and L. agiiis CCUG31450 (produced in MRS medium). Percentages of growth inhibition were obtained with biosurfactant mixtures at different concentrations. The legend shows the individual concentration of each biosurfactant present in the mixture. Results represent the average of three experiments and error bars represent the SD.\nThe biosurfactants obtained from alternative media were also mixed and tested for their antimicrobial activity. The mixture was effective against S', agaiactiae (Figure 24) completely inhibiting its growth (at 2.5 mg/ml biosurfactant) corresponding to a positive interaction between the individual biosurfactants. Statistical analysis again showed that the differences observed between mixture and individual performances were significant (pvalue&lt;0.0001). Contrarily, the mixture was not effective against the other microorganisms studied, suggesting an antagonist effect\n97\nbetween the biosurfactants present in the mixture. In some cases this antagonist effect was found to be very strong. For instance, the individual biosurfactants from B subti/is PX573 (produced in CSL medium) and P. aeruginosa PX112 (produced in CSLM medium) showed antimicrobial activity against E coii of 38.5 % (Figure 20B) and 35.4 % (Figure 21B), respectively. However, the mixture of these two biosurfactants showed a very low percentage of growth inhibition (16.3 %) (Figure 24). The same was observed for S aureus and P. aeruginosa.\nFigure 24. Antimicrobial activity of biosurfactant mixtures against bacterial and yeast strains. The mixtures were prepared at 1:1 proportion with freeze-dried biosurfactants recovered from P. aeruginosa PX112 (produced in CSLM medium) and B subtiiis PX573 (produced in CSL medium). Percentages of growth inhibition were obtained with biosurfactant mixtures at different concentrations. The legend shows the individual concentration of each biosurfactant present in the mixture. Results represent the average of three experiments and error bars represent SD.\nThe antimicrobial assays performed with the individual biosurfactants produced by lactic acid bacteria showed a common activity against S aureus. Therefore, mixtures combining biosurfactants from L. paracasei A20, L. animaiis ATCC35046 and L. agiiis CCUG31450 were prepared, and their activity against S. aureus was evaluated. From Figure 25, the antimicrobial activity of the mixture (55.3 %) showed a great increase as compared to the individual biosurfactants from L. paracaseiA20 (5.2 %) and L. animaiisATCC35046 (16.9 %) (Table 26). The mixture of these biosurfactants produced a remarkable synergistic effect since the individual biosurfactants activity was greatly enhanced. The same synergistic effect was observed for the mixture of biosurfactants from L. paracaseiA20 and L. agiiis CCUG31450 in MRS medium. The antimicrobial activity of the mixture is significantly higher (28.9 %) comparing to the individual\n98\nbiosurfactants. Statistical analysis confirm the significance of the differences observed (p-value = 0.04). However, in the case of the mixture of L. animalis ATCC35046 and L. agiHs CCUG31450, the antimicrobial activity of the mixture was similar to the one obtained for each biosurfactant at a concentration of 5 mg/ml.\nThe individual biosurfactants tested in the mixtures that are presented in Figure 25 did not show any antimicrobial activity against S aureus at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. However, mixing the individual biosurfactants at 2.5 mg/ml led to 17.4 - 26.0 % growth inhibition of S aureus. In summary, a clear synergistic effect could be observed for the mixtures of lactic acid bacteria biosurfactants. Actually, these mixtures potentiated the individual performance even at low concentrations. The interaction between the different biosurfactants might have led to complex structures with more affinity to the microbe's cell surface where the biosurfactants could exert a more potent antimicrobial activity. Although the percentages of growth inhibition were generally low, the potential of these biosurfactants as antimicrobial agents should be further explored.\nFigure 25. Antimicrobial activity of biosurfactant mixtures against S. aureus. The mixtures were prepared at 1:1 proportion with freeze-dried biosurfactants recovered from different lactic acid bacteria cultivated in MRS medium. Percentages of growth inhibition were obtained with biosurfactant mixtures at different concentrations. The legend shows the individual concentration of each biosurfactant present in the mixture. Results represent the average of three experiments and error bars represent the SD.\n99\npositive or even a synergistic effect as could be expected, but contrarily in some cases an antagonist effect was observed.\nAs mentioned before, the biosurfactants produced either by B subti/is PX573 or by P aeruginosa PX112 are most likely anionic [159, 160]. Therefore, as both are negatively charged, a repulsive effect could prevent the interaction between them, which could explain the antagonist effect observed. On the other hand, since the bacterial surface has an anionic charge, [165] the negative species on the cell surface could induce an electrostatic repulsion between the anionic biosurfactants and the cell surface. Since the mixture of both biosurfactants should have an extremely anionic nature, the electrostatic repulsion between the cell surface of microorganisms and the mixture is amplified comparing to the individual biosurfactants. Kihara et al. [165] studied the interaction of anionic surfactants with polyvalent metal cations. In this study it was observed that the presence of polyvalent metal cations increases the activity of the anionic surfactants. The authors found that the anionic surfactant was remarkably effective against E co/i in the presence of only a few polyvalent cations. This effect is observed because polyvalent cations neutralize the negative charge of the cell surface in the presence of the surfactant, indicating that the interaction between the hydrophobic NaOS-polycation complex and the cell surface is promoted.\nIn order to develop more efficient mixtures, an mixture between anionic and cationic biosurfactants could promote a better interaction between the mixture and the cell surface of microorganisms similarly to the report by Kihara et al. [165].\nOn the other hand, the mixture of biosurfactants produced by L. paracasei A20 and L. animalis ATCC35046 showed a high synergistic effect. Since the yield of biosurfactants produced by lactic acid bacteria is very low, the mixture of these biosurfactants would reduce the amount of biosurfactants required to promote a better effect comparing to the amounts required for the individual biosurfactants to produce the same effect. The results suggest that these biosurfactants in the mixture might have a better affinity to the microbe's cell surface, thus enhancing their antimicrobial activity. However, in order to understand more clearly the interaction between these biosurfactants, and consequently their effect on a given microorganism, a more profound study on the structure of these biosurfactants should be conducted.\n100\nthat are resistant to conventional treatment agents. S. aureus is a common cause of community and hospital-acquired infections. Moreover, the clinical impact of S. aureus is rising due to the global increase in the incidence of multidrug-resistant strains and its growing prevalence as a major cause of surgical infections [92]. As a result, there is an urgent need to identify new antimicrobial agents and develop preventive strategies to help in the management of these types of infections. Therefore, the biosurfactants and their mixtures herein studied could be an answer to the necessity of efficient antimicrobial agents against antibiotic resistant microorganisms. The biosurfactants that cannot act by themselves and that did not show a positive interaction with other biosurfactants could be further evaluated in combination with antibiotics towards an enhanced activity, reduction of antibiotics concentrations, and reduction of pathogenic microorganism\u2019s resistance to those pharmaceutical agents. For instance, Ortiz et al. [161] suggested that bacteria with more hydrophobic surface will be more susceptible to the action of hydrophobic antibiotics, thus future research should focus on the combined use of rhamnolipids with antibiotics to potentiate the antibiotics effects. Rivardo et al. [166] showed that V9T14 biosurfactant produced by B. Ucheniformis V9T14 in association with antibiotics (ampicillin) led to a synergistic increase of the antibiotic efficacy in biofilm killing, and in some combinations led to the total eradication of E coii CFT073 biofilm. Moreover, it was showed that the concentration of antibiotic required to obtain the same effect was decreased by the presence of the biosurfactant. The authors hypothesize that the action of V9T14 biosurfactant lies in its interaction with the bacterial membrane, increasing the activity of antimicrobial agents by forming pores in the outer membrane and thus facilitating the entrance of the antibiotics. The use of surfactin to increase the effect of enrofloxacin against planktonic Mycoplasma pulmonis was also reported in literature [167].\n101\n3.4.2.\tAnti-adhesion activity\ni. Staphylococcus aureus\nThe anti-adhesive activity of a variety of individual biosurfactants produced by several bacteria in different media were evaluated against S', aureus (Figure 26). The biosurfactants produced by L. agi/isCCUG31450 in MRS medium showed the greatest anti-adhesive activity, 64.5 % at 10 mg/ml, in contrast with the ones produced in CWM, in which no anti-adhesive activity was detected. Regarding the biosurfactants produced by P. aeruginosa PX112, either in LB or in CSLM medium, the anti-adhesive activity against S', aureus was similar and low, 10.6 % and 11.2 %, respectively, for the highest concentration tested. The biosurfactants from L. paracaseiA20 in MRS medium and B. subtiiis PX573 in CSL medium revealed also an interesting anti-adhesive activity,\n29.6\t% and 46.8 %, respectively.\n102\nAlso in this case different biosurfactants combinations were explored towards an enhanced activity. Mixtures were performed using freeze-dried biosurfactants from B. subti/is PX573, P. aeruginosa PX112, L. paracaseiA20 and L. agiiisCCUG31450 at different proportions. The mixture of biosurfactants produced by B subti/is PX573 in CSL medium and biosurfactants produced by L. aigiis CCUG31450 in MRS medium at 1:1 proportion (Figure 27), showed the most favorable results, 68.4 % of microbial adhesion inhibition, marginally higher than the best result obtained using individual biosurfactants (64.6 % for the L. agiiisCCUG31450 biosurfactant obtained in MRS). Likewise the mixture containing the biosurfactants from P aeruginosa PX112 in CSLM medium and L. agiisCCUG31450 in MRS medium showed a good anti-adhesive activity (60.7 %). For both mixtures above mentioned a positive interaction could be found between the biosurfactants used. On the other hand, the other mixtures tested showed antagonist effects, i.e. the anti-adhesive activity of the mixtures were lower than the activity of the individual biosurfactants, at the same concentration.\nPX112\tCCUG31450 a) CCUG31450 a)\tL. agiis\tL. paracasei A20\tA20\nCCUG31450 b)\nFigure 27.

Biosurfactants produced in a) MRS medium and b) CWM.\n103\nii. Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nIn the same way, several biosurfactants produced in this work were test against P. aeruginosa in order to evaluate their anti-adhesive activity (Figure 28). The biosurfactants from L. agiiis CCUG31450 in CWM showed the greatest anti-adhesive activity, 46.2 % at 1 mg/ml, although no anti-adhesive effect was previously found against S', aureus. Regarding the biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112 in LB or in CSLM medium, it was observed a small difference in their antiadhesive activity against P. aeruginosa, 17.3 % and 27.4 %, respectively, for the highest concentration tested. No anti-adhesive activity could be found for the biosurfactants from L. paracaseiA20, contrarily to what was previously seen for S', aureus. These distinct results suggest that each biosurfactant have a unique effect that could be different from microorganism to microorganism.\na)\tb)\nFigure 28.

The mixture of biosurfactants from B. subtiiis PX573 produced in CSL medium and P. aeruginosa PX112 was found to be very interesting, since a positive interaction between both biosurfactants was observed. The anti-adhesive activity of the mixture, 40.7 % (1:1 proportion), is superior to the activity of each biosurfactant, 28.3 % for biosurfactants from B subtiiis PX573 and 27.3 % for biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112, at 10 mg/ml.\nFigure 29. Anti-adhesive properties of several biosurfactant mixtures against P. aeruginosa. Percentages of microbial adhesion inhibition were obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants recovered from different bacterial strains and dissolved in demineralized water at different proportions. Results represent average three experiments and error bars represent SD. Biosurfactants produced in a) MRS medium and b) CWM.\nTo test the properties of the P. aeruginosa PX112 biosurfactants produced in LB medium and recovered by different strategies, anti-adhesive assays were performed against S', aureus and P. aeruginosa. The results are gathered in Table 27 and no anti-adhesive activity against P. aeruginosa could be observed either for the biosurfactants recovered by chloroform extraction or by ammonium sulfate precipitation. In contrast, the biosurfactants recovered by acid precipitation inhibited the adhesion of P. aeruginosa, 17.3 % (Figure 28). On the other hand, for P. aeruginosa PX112 biosurfactants produced in LB medium tested against S', aureus, the best results were obtained for the ones recovered by chloroform extraction and by ammonium sulfate precipitation showing similar anti-adhesive activities, 21.9 % and 28.4 %, respectively, for the higher concentration tested. Again, these results suggest that biosurfactants recovered by different techniques could have distinct natures. Moreover, the reduced activity of the biosurfactants\n105\nrecovered by acid precipitation could be due to the greater amount of impurities present that will naturally interfere with biosurfactants activity.\nTable 27.

Microorganisms produce biosurfactants, which prevent the adhesion of other microorganisms, as a mechanism of defense from environmental assaults. In other words, the biosurfactants are responsible for conditioning the surface causing physical and chemical alterations that can prevent bacteria from adhering [168]. This ability to decrease the bacterial attachment to a given surface has been reported for biosurfactants produced by a large range of microorganisms such as Lactobacillus\tspp.,\tBacillus\tspp.,\tP.\taeruginosa,\tStreptococcus spp.,\tCandida\tspp.\t[94-\n96,119,169-171]. For instance, the biosurfactant released by an oral Streptococcus mitis strain reduced the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans [168]. Similarly, L. fermentum RC-14 releases components with surface activity that can inhibit the adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria, including E faeca/is [172].\n106\nIn this work, the most interesting anti-adhesive activity, either against S. aureus or P. aeruginosa, was observed for the biosurfactants from lactic acid bacteria, mostly L. agiiis CCUG31450. Several studies already reported the efficiency of other lactic acid bacteria in decreasing the bacteria and yeast adhesion, namely L. /actis, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. caseiand L rhamnosusstrains [173]. Walenka et al [173] described the inhibition of S', aureus adhesion due to biosurfactants obtained from three strains of L. acidophilus. The authors suggested that the anti-adhesive effect of the biosurfactant mixture could be due to the changes in the cell-to-surface interactions causing alterations in the hydrophobicity of the surface. The same changes in the properties of the surface could also explain the anti-adhesive effect that was observed for the biosurfactants from L. agiiis CCUG31450.\nHowever, the exact mechanisms of anti-adhesive activity has not yet been explained, it seems to be highly dependent on the properties of the target bacteria, surface properties and biosurfactant type [174].\nRegarding biosurfactants produced by L. paracasei A20, clear differences in the antiadhesive activity were observed. A 29.6 % inhibition was observed against S', aureus, while no activity was observed against P aeruginosa. The biosurfactants from L. agiiisCCUG31450 in CWM showed an opposite effect, being more effective against P aeruginosa (35.2 %) than against S'. aureus (0 %). This distinct effect of the biosurfactants could be due to the differences in the bacteria, since S', aureus is a Gram-positive and P aeruginosa is a Gram-negative. In order to better understand the influence of cell surface properties on the anti-adhesive activity of biosurfactants, Zeraik and Nitschke [174] performed a physicochemical characterization of cell surfaces of some microorganisms. All bacteria studied, S', aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and M. /uteus, were classified as strongly hydrophobic. S', aureus showed the highest hydrophobic characteristic, thus clarifying its great affinity to the hydrophobic polystyrene surface. Similarly, Makin et al. [175] studied the characteristics of the surface of P aeruginosa, in order to understand its influence in the action of the biosurfactants. The authors showed that P aeruginosa has two chemically and immunologically distinct LPS O-polysaccharide species, termed the A and B. The presence or absence of species A and B and their proportion influence the surface characteristics of the strains, thus affecting their ability to adhere to hydrophilic (glass) and hydrophobic (polystyrene) surfaces. Therefore, the differences in the activity of the same biosurfactants against distinct bacteria could also be explained due to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of the cells surface.\n107\nIn the case of surface properties, is known that biosurfactants could adsorb to a substratum surface and alter the hydrophobicity of the surface interfering with the microbial adhesion processes [168]. Rodrigues et al. [117] postulated that biosurfactants reduce the hydrophobic interactions, and consequently the microbial adhesion. Hydrophobic surfaces have shown to be particularly colonized by microorganisms, probably because these surfaces facilitate the close approach between microorganism and solid substratum. Consequently, when a surface is conditioned with biosurfactant, it becomes more hydrophilic, with an expected decrease of microbial attachment. Zeraik and Nitschke [174] observed a decrease in the hydrophobicity of surfaces treated with surfactin and also a substantial decrease of bacterial attachment, which is in agreement with the aforementioned explanation. Correspondingly, the results obtained in this work showed that biosurfactants from B subti/is PX573 in CSL medium, probably surfactin, were responsible for a microbial adhesion decrease of 46.8 % for the Gram-positive S aureus and of\n28.6\t% for the Gram-negative P. aeruginosa. According to the previous explanation, these biosurfactants probably altered the hydrophobicity of the surface causing a decrease in the microbial adhesion. Furthermore, Zeraik and Nitschke [174] showed that polystyrene becomes more hydrophilic after being conditioned with surfactin, while conditioning with rhamnolipids increased the surface hydrophobicity. Being the microorganism S aureus extremely hydrophobic that could explain why the biosurfactants from B subti/is PX573 showed a stronger anti-adhesive activity (46.8 %) than the biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112 in LB medium (10.6 %), and in CSLM medium (11.2 %) at 10 mg/ml. The differences observed could also be attributed to the chemical composition of the biosurfactants (one is a lipopeptide, while the other is a glycolipid), their molecular orientation on the surfaces, as well as their surface properties.\nAs previously mentioned, the chemical structure of biosurfactants, mainly the proportions of their components, seems to significantly affect their anti-adhesive properties [135]. Velraeds et al. [119] revealed that biosurfactants containing a higher fraction of proteins, synthesized by L. acidophilusRC14 and L. fermentum B54, are more effective in impeding the adhesion of E faecaiis 1131 to glass than those containing high polysaccharide and phosphate contents. These effects can explain the differences observed for biosurfactants produced by different lactic acid bacteria, or by the same microorganisms but in different media. Also, it should be noted that the more hydrophilic or hydrophobic character of the biosurfactants will influence its activity. Rodrigues et al. [101] showed that the most active fraction isolated from a biosurfactant mixture produced by\n108\nS thermophilus A exhibited a high hydrophilic character. Furthermore, the authors showed that adsorbing the biosurfactant from L. iactis53 onto the surface of silicone rubber turned the surface more hydrophilic. Likewise the biosurfactants from L. agi/is CCUG31450 produced in MRS may have a good hydrophilic character and consequently lead to a more hydrophilic surface that is traduced in a higher anti-adhesive activity. This hydrophilic character of the biosurfactants showed a more pronounced effect against S aureus (64.6 %) (Figure 26) (most probably the strain with the stronger hydrophobic character), comparing to P aeruginosa, 0 % (Figure 28) (most probably this strain possesses a more hydrophilic cell surface) at the highest concentration tested.\nAn interesting result obtained in this work was observed for the mixture of biosurfactants produced by L. agi/is CCUG31450 in different media. As can been seen the biosurfactants produced in MRS medium showed a stronger anti-adhesive activity against S aureus, 64.6 % (Figure 26). However, no activity was observed against P aeruginosa (Figure 28). The anti-adhesive assays with biosurfactants produced in CWM, on the contrary presented no activity against S aureus but a good anti-adhesive activity against P aeruginosa (46.2 %), for the concentration 1 mg/ml. Considering these results, both biosurfactants were mixed aiming at producing a mixture with a wider spectrum of action, i.e. effective against the two pathogenic microorganisms. The mixture at 1:1 proportion (individual concentration of biosurfactants 10 mg/ml) proved to be effective against the two strains tested. Specifically, it was observed a reduction of cell adhesion of\n47.4\t% for P aeruginosa (Figure 29) and 22.7 % for S aureus (Figure 27). In the case of P aeruginosa strain, the mixture showed an increase of activity, 47.4 %, when compared with the individual biosurfactants, 0 %, for the ones produced in MRS medium; and 35.2% for the ones produced in CMW (Figure 28). Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the mixture showed a positive interaction, resulting in a synergistic anti-adhesive effect. On the other hand, for the strain S aureus the anti-adhesive effect observed, 22.7 %, was reduced as compared with the individual effects of the biosurfactants produced in MRS medium, 64.0 % (Figure 26). In this case, the results suggest a negative interaction between the biosurfactants, i.e. an antagonistic effect.\n109\nThe remarkable anti-adhesive activity observed for some of the biosurfactants and mixtures, tested in this work, point them as potential agents for diverse applications.\nBacteria growing as a biofilm remain a significant challenge in the biomedical field, growing on abiotic material such as catheters and prosthesis, as they tend to be more tolerant to antimicrobial treatments. Frequent replacement of the prosthesis is uncomfortable, costly, time consuming, and may lead to damage of the patients cellular tissues [136]. Therefore, the application of these biosurfactants with anti-adhesive activity against pathogenic microorganisms could limit biofilm infection by preventing the microbial adhesion to the surfaces of medical devices, and consequently preventing biofilm formation and leading to a reduction of a large number of hospital infections without the use of synthetic drugs and chemicals [101].\nFor example, as a potential application, these biosurfactants could be used to pre-coat the surfaces of prosthesis, implants and surgical instruments, where no microbial populations are desirable [168]. These applications were already explored in other studies, for example PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) surfaces pre-conditioned with rhamnolipids were able to reduce L. monocytogenes attachment [176]. Pre-coating of vinyl urethral catheters with surfactin from B subtilis caused a reduction in the amount of biofilm formed by several microorganisms, such as A faecaiis, Klebsiella aerogenes, S. typhimurium [94, 168]. L. iactis and S thermophilus A produce biosurfactants that are able to decrease the amount of bacteria in a multi-species biofilm on voice prosthesis [101, 117]. Surfactin and rhamnolipids are able to prevent E coii and P mirabiiis biofilm attachment. S enterica biofilm adhesion on vinyl urethral catheters (14Fr) was inhibited by pre-coating the surface of the device with 100 pg of surfactin and the same effect was observed for E coii. On the other hand, the treatment was completely ineffective against P aeruginosa [94].\nThe anti-adhesive activity observed for the biosurfactants tested, highlighting the ones produced by L. agiiisCCUG31450 and B subtilis PX573 in CSL, against the pathogens evaluated indicate their potential usefulness for biomedical applications in the protection of biomaterials, but also to prevent food contamination [177, 178]. Nitschke et al [179] tested biosurfactants with antiadhesive activity and observed a reduction in the adhesion of food pathogens L. monocytogenes, Enterobactersakasakiiand Salmonella enteriUdison stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces.\n110\n3.4.3.\tOil recovery\nTwo chemical surfactants and three biosurfactants were selected to perform oil recovery assays. From all the individual surfactants studied, the best results of oil recovery from contaminated sand were obtained with the chemical surfactant Enordet (54.4 %) and the biosurfactants from P aeruginosa PX112 (produced in CSLM medium) (55.0 %) (Figure 30). On the other hand, at the same concentration, the biosurfactants produced in CSL medium by B. subtiiis PX573 showed a poorer activity in oil recovery, only 25.1 %, corresponding to half the percentage observed for the most efficient surfactants. The biosurfactants from L. agiiis CCUG31450 in CWM were also tested, although no oil recovery was observed.\nFigure 30. Removal of crude oil from contaminated sand by different biosurfactants and chemical surfactants. Percentages of oil recovered were obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants isolated from several bacterial strains and surfactants dissolved in demineralized water at different concentrations. Only Enordet and the biosurfactants recovered from B subtiiis PX573 were tested at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Results represent the average of two independent experiments and error bars represent SD. In the control conditions (demineralized water) no oil recovery was observed.\nSeveral mixtures with chemical surfactants and biosurfactants were prepared at different proportions and concentrations to study oil recovery. The analysis of the results in Table 28 showed that the mixture yielding the best percentage of oil recovery, 55.0 %, was the one containing biosurfactants produced in alternative media by B. subtiiis PX573 and P aeruginosa PX112 at an individual concentration of 5 mg/ml. However, when comparing this mixture with the results\n111\nobtained for the individual biosurfactants, it was not observed any improvement on the oil recovery. The values obtained for all the concentrations tested for this mixture were very similar to the values observed for the individual biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112.\nAnother mixture that yielded a good oil recovery, 52.0 %, was the one containing the biosurfactant from B. subtiiis PX573 (1 mg/ml) and Enordet (2.5 mg/ml). However, this mixture did not revealed an enhanced activity when compared with the chemical surfactant alone (49.1 %).On the other hand, analyzing the results obtained for the mixture with the same surfactants, but at different concentrations (B subtiiis PX573 (0.5 mg/ml) and Enordet (1 mg/ml)), an interesting and different effect was observed. The effect of this mixture in oil recovery was enhanced (31.1 %) when compared with the effect of Enordet alone (23.9%), although the individual biosurfactants from B subtiiis PX573 at this concentration (0.5 mg/ml) did not show any ability to recover oil from the contaminated sand. Another example of a positive interaction between biosurfactants was observed for the mixture of biosurfactants from B subtiiis PX573 (2.5 mg/ml) and Enordet (1 mg/ml). As can be seen, the mixture showed an enhanced activity, 42.5 %, when compared with the individual activity of the biosurfactants from B. subtiiis PX573, 26.3 %, and Enordet, 23.9 %. The other two combinations of B subtiiis PX573 and Enordet tested also resulted in an increased percentage of oil recovered.\nEach mixture has an interaction between their biosurfactants that can be very distinct and unique. A positive interaction could also be observed (23.9 % oil recovery) for the biosurfactants from B subtiiis PX573 (1 mg/ml, 15.0 %) and the surfactant Petrostep (1 mg/ml, 15.6 %). On the other hand, the other combinations tested with these surface active compounds did not resulted in a positive effect. For the three different mixtures of biosurfactants from B subtiiis PX573 and from P. aeruginosa PX112, no increase in the oil recovery could be observed. Moreover, the mixtures of biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112 and the chemical surfactants resulted in similar and low amounts of oil recovered.\n112\nMixtures\tSurfactant concentration (mg/ml) A: B\t% Oil Recovery (A)\t% Oil Recovery (B)\t% Oil Recovery (Mixture)\n\t5.0 : 5.0\t25.1 \u00b1 1.7\t55.0 \u00b13.4\t55.0 \u00b16.8\nB. subtilis PX573: P. aeruginosa PX112\t2.5 : 2.5\t26.3 \u00b10.0\t43.7 \u00b1 0.3\t43.7 \u00b14.2\n\t1.0 : 1.0\t15.0 \u00b10.8\t22.1 \u00b12.5\t21.5 \u00b13.4\n\t1.0 : 1.0\t15.0 \u00b10.8\t23.9 \u00b11.7\t32.9 \u00b12.5\n\t1.0 : 2.5\t15.0 \u00b10.8\t49.1 \u00b1 1.7\t52.0 \u00b12.5\nB. subtilis PX573 : Enordet\t2.5 : 1.0\t26.3 \u00b10.0\t23.9 \u00b1 1.7\t41.9 \u00b1 5.6\n\t0.5 : 1.0\t0.0 \u00b10.0\t23.9 \u00b1 1.7\t31.1 \u00b13.4\n\t1.0 : 0.5\t15.0 \u00b10.8\t15.6 \u00b1 1.7\t28.1 \u00b12.5\nP. aeruginosa PX112 : Enordet\t1.0 : 1.0\t22.1 \u00b12.5\t23.9 \u00b1 1.7\t21.5 \u00b10.0\nB. subtilis PX573 : Petrostep\t1.0 : 1.0\t15.0 \u00b10.8\t15.6 \u00b1 1.7\t23.9 \u00b13.4\nP. aeruginosa PX112 : Petrostep\t1.0 : 1.0\t22.1 \u00b12.5\t15.6 \u00b1 1.7\t15.0 \u00b12.5\nStudy of biosurfactants \u201ccocktails\u201d with enhanced properties\nThe study of the efficiency in oil recovery by chemical surfactants and biosurfactants has also been reported by other researchers. Pornsunthorntawee et al. [99] showed that biosurfactants from B. subti/is PT2 had a greater efficiency in oil recovery than those produced by P aeruginosa SP4, suggesting that the two excreted biosurfactants should have different characteristics, which are probably governed by the sources of the bacteria. On the contrary, the results obtained in this work showed that the biosurfactants from P aeruginosa PX112 were more efficient than the ones from B. subti/is PX573. The results suggested that probably the P aeruginosa PX112 biosurfactants could be more compatible with the Arabian Light oil tested. As previously discussed, the emulsifying activity of biosurfactants from P aeruginosa PX112 (Figure 12) was higher compared with the values obtained for the biosurfactants from B. subti/is PX573 (Figure 7), suggesting that the P aeruginosa PX112 biosurfactants are more effective in removing oil from the sand and promoting oil solubilization.\nPornsunthorntawee et al. [99] showed that biosurfactants could recover oil more effectively than three synthetic surfactants (Tween80, SDBS, Alfoterra 145-5PO). In this study, we saw that the P aeruginosa PX112 biosurfactants were equally effective as Enordet and more effective than Petrostep (Figure 30). The higher ability of these biosurfactants to solubilize oil could be explained by their hydrophobicity. Moreover, being an anionic biosurfactant, its negative charge on the head group is able to aid the repulsion between the attached oil droplets and the sand surface, leading to the detachment of the oil from the sand surface. Briefly, on one hand the hydrophobicity of biosurfactants improves the solubilization of the oil, and on the other hand their anionic nature promotes the detachment of oil from sand.\nThe two biosurfactants tested gave interesting values of oil recovery, either individually or in combination with chemical surfactants, suggesting that they have a great potential for application in MEOR, as well as in oil removal from contaminated places.\n114\n4.\tGENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n4.1.\tConclusions\nThe aim of the present work was to prepare mixtures of biosurfactants produced by different microorganisms in order to evaluate their main characteristics (surface tension, emulsification ability, antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities) for several applications, namely in the oil recovery, health care and biomedical fields. To reach these purposes several subjects were studied and different applications were positively tested. The main conclusions drawn from this work are the following:\n\u2022\tFrom the several bacteria tested, L. agi/is CCUG31450, P. aeruginosa PX112 and B subtiiis PX573 were found to be the best biosurfactants producers.\n\u2022\tThe optimization of environmental factors showed that an increase on the agitation up to\n200 rpm improved the biosurfactants production by B subtiiis PX573 and P. aeruginosa PX112, probably due to a higher oxygen transfer.\n\u2022\tLow-cost media, prepared with molasses and CSL, proved to be suitable alternatives to synthetic media for the production of biosurfactants by B subtiiis PX573 and P. aeruginosa PX112, leading to a remarkable increase in the biosurfactant yields of 2.8 and 2.5 times, respectively.\n\u2022\tThe supplementation of the low-cost media with trace elements, Fe2+, Mn2+ and Mg2+, showed to be a beneficial for the production of biosurfactants by B subtiiis PX573, most probably because these trace elements play a key role as co-factors in the enzymes that are involved in the biosurfactants synthesis.\n\u2022\tThe conjugation of acid precipitation with a second recovery methodology, mainly ammonium sulfate precipitation, led to an improvement of the biosurfactants recovery from the culture broth supernatants.\n\u2022\tGrowth of L. agi/is CCUG31450 under aerobic conditions demonstrated to be the most favorable condition for the synthesis of this type of biosurfactants.\n117\n| 4. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\u2022\tThe low-cost medium prepared with cheese whey for biosurfactant production by L. agi/is CCUG31450, although conducting to an increase of the biosurfactants yield, did not led to a further decrease of the surface tension as compared to the biosurfactants being produced in MRS medium.\n\u2022\tThe biosurfactants herein studied showed, in general, a capacity to withstand extreme conditions of pH, salinity and temperature without losing their physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they are promising molecules to be used in processes as bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites or in the petroleum industry (MEOR).\n\u2022\tThe evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of the individual biosurfactants revealed that the lactic acid bacteria, L. anima/is ATCC35046, L. paracasei A20 and L. agi/is CCUG31450, exhibit a common positive effect against S aureus. Besides, L. agi/is CCUG31450 was the lactic acid bacteria with the greatest range of antimicrobial activity, being effective against three out of five pathogenic strains tested. The biosurfactants produced by B subtiiis PX573 and P aeruginosa PX112 in low-cost media, demonstrated to be, in general, more effective against the microorganisms tested, supporting the positive replacement of synthetic media by the alternative media suggested.\n\u2022\tIn summary, the biosurfactants with a more pronounced activity evidenced a stronger antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria than against the Gram-negative ones, probably due to their easier interaction with Gram-positive cell membrane leading to the loss of cell integrity. Moreover, biosurfactants produced by B subtiiis PX573 and P aeruginosa PX112, besides their notable activity against Gram-positive bacteria; were also found to be active against the yeast strain used. Therefore, these biosurfactants can be used as antimicrobial agents or can be conjugated with antibiotics to enhance their activity and reduce the resistance of pathogenic microorganisms. Nevertheless, some rhamnolipids have been reported as virulence factors, thus further work should be conducted in order to understand if these rhamnolipids are adequate for given applications.\n118\n\u2022\tBiosurfactants are pointed as an alternative to antibiotic treatments, being effective against multi-resistant microorganisms, shush as S aureus. The mixture of several biosurfactants, depending on the biosurfactants and pathogenic organism evaluated, showed either synergistic or antagonistic effects. The most interesting synergistic effect observed was for the mixture of L. paracasei A20 with L. anima/is ATCC35046 biosurfactants.\n\u2022\tBiosurfactants usefulness as anti-adhesive agents was also assessed against two pathogenic strains. In the case of S aureus, the most efficient individual biosurfactant was the one produced by L. agiiis CCUG31450 (MRS), and the best results of antiadhesive activity (68.4 %) were detected for the mixture (1:1 proportion) prepared with biosurfactants from L. agi/isCCUG31450 and B subtiiis (CSL). For the pathogenic strain P. aeruginosa, the higher adhesion inhibition was achieved with the individual biosurfactants of L. agiiis CCUG31450 (CWM), and the mixture (1:2 proportion) of biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa PX112 (CSLM) and L. agiiis CCUG31450 (MRS),\n62.5\t%. In conclusion, each mixture prepared showed a unique effect on the adhesion of pathogenic microorganisms that was dependent on the type of biosurfactants, the proportion of biosurfactants in the mixture and the pathogenic organism.\n\u2022\tThe anti-adhesive activity observed, mostly for probiotic biosurfactants, suggests their application as bio-detergent solutions for cleaning surgical material, and for coating agents to increase prosthesis and catheters lifetime, thus reducing health costs.\n\u2022\tThe good surface and emulsifying activity of biosurfactants from B subtiiis PX573 and P. aeruginosa PX112 indicated their potential to be applied in oil recovery. The results from the oil recovery assays showed that these biosurfactants were efficient, and in some case were even more active than the two chemical surfactants (Enordert and Petrostep) tested. From all the mixtures prepared with biosurfactants and chemical ones, the higher oil recovery percentage (55 %) was obtained for the mixture containing biosurfactants produced in alternative media by B subtiiis PX573 and P. aeruginosa PX112, at an individual concentration of 5 mg/ml. An interesting result was detected for the mixture of B subtiiis PX573 biosurfactants (0.5 mg/ml) and Enordet (1 mg/ml), The effect of\n119\n| 4. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nthis mixture in oil recovery was enhanced (31.1%) when compared with the effect of Enordet alone (23.9%), although the individual biosurfactants from B subti/is PX573 at this concentration (0.5 mg/ml) did not show any ability to recover oil from the contaminated sand. Therefore, biosurfactants could be applied in MEOR or could be mixed with chemical surfactants already used in oil recovery in order to reduce the concentrations required of these surfactants, and consequently reduce their negative environmental impacts.\n4.2.\tRecommendations\nThe results achieved in this work showed the successful implementation of some strategies to improve biosurfactants yields and reduce production costs. Moreover, it was given an interesting perspective of the properties and activities of distinct biosurfactants, as well as their potential to be used in the therapeutic, biomedical and oil recovery field. However, further research should be done as suggested bellow:\n\u2022\tSince the results achieved in the production of biosurfactants by B subti/is PX573 and P. aeruginosa PX112, using low-cost substrates as medium for fermentation, were very promising, it would be interesting to study the fermentation scale-up, reactor design and mode of operation.\n\u2022\tIn the case of L. agiiisCCUG31450 growth in CWM, the results were not as favorable as predicted, i.e. the biosurfactants produced in this medium showed a poor activity. Therefore, more studies should be conducted in order to optimize the cheese whey concentration in the alternative medium, the requirement of trace elements, or even test different low-cost substrates.\n\u2022\tThe strategies applied to reduce the production costs, namely the use of low-cost substrates, provided encouraging results. Nevertheless, other strategies involving different variables of the production process can also be explored, as for example the assessment of overproducing strains.\n120\n\u2022\tThe effect of environmental factors in the biosurfactants activity was tested distinctly, without considering the effects of any interactions between them. In future research, the effect of extreme conditions of pH, temperature and salinity should be evaluated also for the mixtures.\n\u2022\tAnother point of interest is the biochemical composition of biosurfactants. In general, they have been characterized as multi-components biosurfactants. Therefore, further purification and characterization steps are required, mainly in the case of biosurfactants produced by the lactic acid bacteria, for which information on their structures is still scarce. This characterization of biosurfactants, in terms of structure, would help to better understand their interaction in the mixtures, thus facilitating the prediction of the mixture effect and activity.\n\u2022\tIn the biomedical and therapeutic applications, most of the time it is desirable an agent that is active against more than one pathogenic microorganism. Therefore, it would be worth to test the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activity of biosurfactants against microbial consortia. Moreover, several pathogenic strains are biofilm formingmicroorganisms which could interfere with the antimicrobial effect of biosurfactants. The analysis of anti-biofilm activity of the biosurfactants will provide a new overview of the biosurfactants effectiveness.\n\u2022\tBiosurfactants showed interesting antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities indicating their potential application in the medical field. Nevertheless, the therapeutic application of these biosurfactants, produced by different bacteria, requires an evaluation of their biocompatibility before they can be considered for use in health-related areas.\n121\nCD\nLjJ\nO\nLjJ or LjJ Li_\nLjJ\nor\nL0\n1.\tBanat, I.
