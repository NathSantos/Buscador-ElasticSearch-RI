EFNs occur as furrows with a protuberant border on the abaxial surface veins of the leaf \nblade. Each nectary consists of numerous secretory multicellular trichomes, epidermal cells in palisade-like arrangements and \nnon-vascularized parenchyma tissue. Nectar secretion is prolonged, since secretion starts in very young leaves and remains up to \ncompletely expanded leaves. Reduced sugars, lipids, and proteins were histochemically detected in all the nectary cells; phenolic \nsubstances were detected in the vacuoles of the epidermal palisade cells and in some secretory trichome cells. The secretory \ncells that constitute the body of trichomes have large nuclei, dense cytoplasm with numerous mitochondria, dictyosomes, \nscattered lipid droplets and plastids with different inclusions: protein, lipid droplets or starch grains; vacuoles with different \nsizes have membranous material, phenolic and lipophilic substances. The palisade cells show thick periclinal walls, reduced \ncytoplasm with voluminous lipid drops and developed vacuoles. The nectary parenchyma cells contain abundant plasmodesmata \nand cytoplasm with scattered lipid droplets, mitochondria, plastids with starch grains and endoplasmic reticulum. Mucilage \nidioblasts are common in the inner nectary parenchyma. Protoderm and ground meristem participate in the formation of \nEFN. Our data indicate that all nectary regions are involved in nectar production and secretion, constituting a functional unit. \nLongevity of the extrafl oral nectaries is likely associated with the presence of mucilage idioblasts, which increases the capacity \nof the nectary parenchyma to store water.\n\nKey words - anatomy, extrafl oral nectary, Hibiscus pernambucensis, histochemistry, ultrastructure \n\nRESUMO \u2013 (Anatomia, ultra-estrutura e secre\u00e7\u00e3o do nect\u00e1rio extrafl oral de Hibiscus pernambucensis Arruda (Malvaceae)). \nEste trabalho descreve o nect\u00e1rio extrafl oral (NEF) de Hibiscus pernambucensis, uma esp\u00e9cie nativa encontrada ao longo \ndo litoral brasileiro, vegetando \u00e1reas de manguezal e restinga.

From the anatomical point of view \nEFNs vary widely in ontogeny, morphology, and \nstructure. Sometimes the morphological characteristics \nof nectaries, as for example the volume of nectariferous \ntissue seem to be correlated with the quantity of the \n\n\n\n490 J. F. Rocha &amp; S. R. Machado: Extrafl oral nectary of Hibiscus pernambucensis \n\nnectar secreted but not its quality (see Nepi 2007). The \ndiversity in nectary shape and location is taxonomically \nvaluable in addition to their ecological role in plant-\ninsect interactions (Bentley 1977, Bentley &amp; Elias 1983, \nKoptur 1992, Rudgers &amp; Gardener 2004, W\u00e4ckers &amp; \nBonifay 2004, D\u00edaz-Castelazo et al. 2005; Doak et al. \n2007). \n\nIn Malvaceae, EFNs occur in the form of furrows, \nchambers or depressions coated with multicellular \nsecretory trichomes (Sawidis et al. 1987a, b, 1989, \nSawidis 1991, 1998, Vogel 2000, Rocha et al. 2002). \nDespite the representativeness of Malvaceae in tropical \necosystems, the secretory structure and activity of EFNs \nhave been investigated in only a few members of this \nfamily, involving some species of the Abutilon (Findlay \n&amp; Mercer 1971a, b, Reed et al. 1971, Gunning &amp; Hughes \n1976), Gossypium (Tyler 1908, Reed 1917, Wergin et al. \n1975, Eleftheriou &amp; Hall 1983) and Hibiscus, especially \nH. rosa-sinensis L. (Santos 1959, Sawidis et al. 1987a, \nb, 1989, Sawidis 1991, 1998). Indeed, for some time, \nthe greater part of anatomical and ultrastructural studies \non Malvaceae EFNs reports on the secretory trichomes \nor subglandular tissue, as separate components of the \nnectary.\n\nHibiscus pernambucensis Arruda, known popularly \nas guaxima-do-mangue, algod\u00e3o-do-brejo and embira-\ndo-mangue, is a native shrub commonly occurring along \nBrazil\u2019s coastline in mangroves and restinga (coastal \nsandy plains vegetation) (Pio Corr\u00eaa 1984, Lorenzi \n1992). This species has an economic potential as a source \nof textile and cellulose fi bers for the manufacture of \npaper, as well as of mucilage with the same medicinal \napplications as those of other mallows, in addition to \nits lightweight wood utilized in the fabrication of small \nobjects, toys and boxes for packaging (Pio Corr\u00eaa \n1984). It is an ornamental species and indicated for \nplanting in degraded areas (Lorenzi 1992). Moreover, \nH. pernambucensis plays an important role in the \nregeneration of mangroves, providing favorable \nconditions for the reestablishment of species typical of \nthis habitat (Ara\u00fajo &amp; Maciel 1979).\n\nThe purpose of this work was to study the extrafl oral \nnectary of H. pernambucensis, especially regarding the \nanatomy, ultrastructure, ontogeny and histochemistry, \nand to relate these to secretion mechanisms.\n\nMaterial and methods \n\nHibiscus pernambucensis plants occurring in natural \ncommunities along the restinga of Sahy Beach in the \nmunicipality of Mangaratiba, state of Rio de Janeiro, were \n\nselected for observation and periodic collection of samples \nduring 2003-2004. Plant voucher specimens were deposited in \nBOTU Herbarium of the Departamento de Bot\u00e2nica, Instituto \nde Bioci\u00eancias, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in \nBotucatu municipality, S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil. The insects on \nthe EFNs were collected and identifi ed on the Departamento \nde Entomologia of the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de \nJaneiro (UFRRJ).\n\nAnatomical studies \u2013 To characterize the anatomical \nstructure and analyze the development of the extrafl oral \nnectaries, samples of vegetative apices and basal region of \nleaf blade in different development phases were fi xed in \nFAA (formaldehyde, acetic acid, ethanol 70%, 1:1:18v/v) \n(Johansen 1940), dehydrated in an ethyl series, embedded \nin Leica\u00ae plastic resin according to the manufacturer\u2019s \nrecommendations, and sliced in a rotating microtome. The \nsections (6-8 ?m) were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue \nin acetate buffer, pH 4.3 (O\u2019Brien et al. 1964) and mounted \nbetween slides and coverslips using synthetic resin (Gerlach \n1969). \n\nHistochemical tests \u2013 Sections of nectaries in the secretory \nstage, occurring in freshly collected completely expanded \nleaves, were obtained with a Ranvier microtome and treated \nwith Sudan IV to detect lipids (Johansen 1940); with 10% \nferric chloride to detect phenolic compounds (Johansen \n1940); 0.02% ruthenium red to detect pectic substances \n(Jensen 1962); Fehling reagent for reducing sugars (Purvis \net al. 1964); aniline blue black for proteins (Fisher 1968); and \nLugol reagent for starch grains (Johansen 1940). In all these \ntests, a control was conducted simultaneously following the \nauthors recommendations. The sections were mounted with \nglycerin between slides and coverslips.\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) \u2013 Samples were \nfi xed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer \nsolution at pH 7.3, for 12-18 h at 4 \u00b0C, dehydrated in an ethyl \nalcohol series, critical point dried with CO2 as the transition \nliquid (Robards 1978), mounted with a double adhesive tape \non stubs, and sputter coated with gold. The samples were \nobserved at 20 kV using a Philips SEM 515.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) \u2013 Samples of \nnectaries in the secretory stage, occurring in completely \nexpanded leaves, were fi xed as described above, post-fi xed in \n1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h, dehydrated \nin acetonic series and embedded in Araldite resin. Ultrathin \nsections were contrasted with uranyl acetate (Watson 1958) \nand lead citrate (Reynolds 1963), and observed at 60 kV \nusing a TEM Philips, CM 100.\n\nResults \n\nDistribution, morphology and secretion of EFNs \u2013 The \nextrafl oral nectaries (EFNs) of Hibiscus pernambucensis \noccur on the abaxial surface of the leaf blade located \n\n\n\n Revista Brasil. Bot., V.32, n.3, p.489-498, jul.-set. 2009 491\n\non the basal portion of the median vein, but they can \nalso occur on the lateral veins (fi gure 1). Within each \nindividual leaf, nectaries have a similar morphology, but \nthe one located on the median vein is more developed. \nThey consist of a furrow with raised glabrous-surfaced \nedges (fi gure 2) which widens toward the inside of the \nvein, forming a chamber containing numerous secretory \ntrichomes (fi gure 3). Nonglandular trichomes cover the \nabaxial surface of the leaf blade except in the region of \nthe nectary (fi gure 2). \n\nNectaries at the secretory stage present a tumescent \nborder and are visible on very young leaves with \nc. 0.5-1 cm in length. The secretion is abundant and \nhas a hyaline aspect, fi lling the inside of the chamber \nand sometimes spilling over the edges. The EFNs are \nconstantly foraged by various insects, among which ants \nof the genera Camponotus and Solenopsis and bees of \nthe genus Trigona are the most common. On senescent \nleaves, the nectary is inactive and insects are absent.\n\nAnatomy and ontogeny of EFNs \u2013 Anatomically, the \nnectary consists of three regions (fi gure 3): 1) edge \nof the furrow, a single-layered epidermis constituted \nof column-shaped cells covered by a thick cuticle; 2) \nmulticellular trichomes lodged at the bottom of the furrow \nor nectariferous chamber; 3) a large region formed by \nparenchyma, non-vascularized tissue. The tall epidermal \ncells of the nectary edge present conspicuous pores in \nthe anticlinal walls (fi gure 4). The nectary parenchyma \nis differentiated in two zones: one, located beneath \nepidermis layer, constituted by tangentially fl attened cells \ncompactly arranged (fi gures 3, 5), and an inner region, \nconstituted by several layers of larger parenchyma cells \nand characterized by the presence of large idioblasts \nwith mucilage.\n\nThe nectary located on the median vein initiates \nas a furrow covered by protoderm, constituted by \nhomogeneous size cells with a voluminous nucleus, \ndense cytoplasm and little developed vacuome (fi gure \n6). The protodermal cells lining the bottom of the furrow \nshow a marked elongation allied to an increase of the \nnucleus volume, which in this phase characteristically \noccupies a central position in the cell (fi gure 7). These \ncells divide in a periclinal direction, each one originating \na basal cell and an apical cell. The basal cell remains \ninserted in the epidermis, constituting the basal cell of \nthe trichome. The apical cell divides periclinally, and \nits derivatives divide successively in the transversal \nplane forming a series of up to 10 cells; after this series \nis formed, the cells of the intermediary portion divide \nanticlinally, originating a biseriate portion, while the \n\nFigures 1-5.

TEM analysis showed \nelectron-dense bands (probably pectic substances), \nextending from the internal surface of the outer periclinal \ncell wall toward the cuticle, but not penetrating it (fi gure \n16). Each epidermal cell tipically contains a voluminous \n\nnucleous (fi gure 4) and a large vacuole traversed by \ncytoplasmic strands (fi gure 16). Voluminous oil droplets \n(fi gures 15, 16) occur in the cytoplasmic strands. \nOccasionaly, very small plastids with osmiophilic \ninclusions (fi gure 15) are seen in the outer cytoplasm.\n\nThe secretory trichomes are clavate (fi gures 5, 10) \nand constituted by a basal cell, a short stalk which has \ntwo or three tabular cells, and a body constituted by a \nbiseriate portion with two to six strata of voluminous \nsquare cells and a conical apical cell. In the stalk \ncells the protoplast remais compressed between the \ntangential cell walls (fi gures 10, 11); however, small \nspaces between the plasmalemma and cell wall (fi gures \n10, 13 \u2013 arrowhead) are observed at several points in \nthe body and apical cells. The stalk cells have thick \nlateral walls (fi gures 10, 11), which are electron-opaque \ndue to the impregnation of lipids, while the transversal \ncells are thinner, strongly electron-dense (fi gures 10-12) \nand traversed by plasmodesmata. A thin cuticle remains \nattached on the tangential walls of the stalk cells (fi gures \n10, 11), but cuticle covering the body and apical cells \nforms swellings origining small subcuticular spaces \n(fi gure 10). A spherical or more irregular nucleous, \nmitochondria with prominent cristae, plastids with oil \ndroplets or cuneiform protein inclusions, voluminous \noil droplets and various small vacuoles are common \nin the stalk cell located near the basal cell (fi gure 12). \nThe stalk cell located in the vicinity of the body cells \nshows distinct characteristics, as prominent nucleus and \ntwo large vacuoles (fi gure 10). The cells constituing the \nbody of the secretory trichomes are characterized by \nvoluminous nucleus and a dense-staining cytoplasm with \nabundant ribosomes, many dictyosomes with adjacent \nvesicles, mitochondria with well developed cristae \nand plastids with different inclusions (fi gures 13, 14). \nProminent plastids contained electron-dense matrix, very \nfew thylakoids and a single starch grain (fi gure 13), \nand plastids with cuneiform proteins, with or without \nstarch grains (fi gure 14) are commonly observed. Rough \nendoplasmic reticulum (fi gure 13) and multilamellar \nbody (fi gure 14) were occasionally present. The vacuoles \ncontain a fl occulent material or a strongly electron-dense \ncontent (fi gure 10), probably phenolic substances as \ndetected in histological sections. \n\nParenchyma cells located below epidermal layer \ntipically have irregularly thickened walls with very \nsmall spaces between them, conspicuous nucleus with \nvariable size and shape, abundant cytoplasm and a large \nvacuole or many small vacuoles (fi gure 17) fi lled with a \nfl occulent material.

Bot., V.32, n.3, p.489-498, jul.-set. 2009 495\n\nHistochemical tests \u2013 The active nectaries on completely \nexpanded leaves reacted positively to reducing sugars, \nlipids, pectic substances, proteins and phenolic \ncompounds (table 1). Reducing sugars were detected \nin all the cells of the secretory trichomes and parenchyma \ntissue. Proteins were detected in the cells of the glandular \ntrichomes, nectary parenchyma and in the palisade-\nlike epidermal cells. Oil droplets were detected in the \npalisade-like epidermal cells, secretory trichomes and \nparenchyma tissue. Lipidic substances were also detected \nin the lateral walls of the stalk cells of the secretory \ntrichomes. Pectic substances were more abundant in the \nouter periclinal wall of the palisade-like cells. Phenolic \ncompounds were detected in the palisade cells and in \nthe biseriate portion of the secretory trichomes, but were \nabsent in the parenchyma cells.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe extrafl oral nectaries (EFNs) on the leaves of \nHibiscus pernambucensis are \u201chollow-type nectaries\u201d, \naccording to Zimmermann\u2019s classifi cation (1932). These \nnectaries are characterized by the presence of numerous \nmulticellular, linear secretory trichomes lodged at the \nbottom of the furrow and represent a marked characteristic \nof the order Malvales (Arbo 1972, 1973, Wergin et al. \n1975, Kronestedt et al. 1986, Sawidis et al. 1987a, b). \n\nOur observations showed that the protoderm and \nground meristem participate in the formation of EFNs in \nH. pernambucensis, with an ontogenetic pattern similar \nto that documented for different species of Malvales \n(Arbo 1972, Sawidis et al. 1987a).\n\nIn H. pernambucensis, the extrafl oral nectaries begin \nto secrete nectar from very young to totally expanded \nleaves, with the secretion end coinciding with the \n\nbeginning of senescence. This observation differs from \nmost of the reports (Paiva &amp; Machado 2006), which \ndescribe active extrafl oral nectaries only on young leaves, \nand inactive nectaries on completely expanded leaves. \nThe constant presence of Camponotus ants visiting the \nextrafl oral nectaries of young and totally expanded \nleaves of H. pernambucensis plants was also reported \nby Cogni &amp; Freitas (2002), who found that these ants are \naggressive and attack termites. Arbo (1972) considered \nthat the extrafl oral nectaries of Byttneria, a genus of \nSterculiaceae, which, together with Malvaceae, comprise \nthe order Malvales, constitute a source of food that attracts \nants. It is remarkable that the EFNs of H. pernambucensis \nproduce abundant lipids and, as described for other \nspecies (Roth 1968, Durkee et al. 1981, Machado 1999), \nthese substances may be part of the exudate acting as a \nfood source, especially for ants.\n\nIn active nectaries, lipid droplets, reduced sugars, \nproteins bodies and phenolic compounds were detected \nby histochemistry. The EFNs of H. pernambucensis are \ndevoid of their own vascularization and the reducing \nsugars and water components of the nectar possibly are \nprovided by the phloem sap of the vein into which the \nEFN is inserted, as already described for Gossypium \nspecies (Wergin et al. 1975) and for Hibiscus tiliaceus \nL. (Rocha et al. 2002). Alternatively, in some species, \nnectar sugars are produced in the own nectary cells by \nphotosynthesis, whereupon starch grains remains in the \nplastids for a short period only (Paiva &amp; Machado 2008). \nPhenolic compounds in the EFNs of H. pernambucensis \nmay be associated with protection against biotic \n(herbivores and microbes) and abiotic (protection against \nUV-B radiation) stresses, which are functions related to \nthe chemical structure of their components (Hutzler et \nal. 1998).

F. Rocha &amp; S. R. Machado: Extrafl oral nectary of Hibiscus pernambucensis \n\nassociated with storage of retained nitrogen, and their \nparticipation in nectar production is uncertain (Nepi \n2007). \n\nThe secretory trichomes of H. pernambucensis have \ncommon characteristics to nectaries of different species, \nsuch as plastids with prominent starch grains, abundant \ndictyosomes, numerous mitochondria and endoplasmic \nreticulum (Fahn 1979; Durkee et al. 1981; Durkee 1983; \nEleftheriou &amp; Hall 1983; Robards &amp; Stark 1988; Sawidis \net al. 1989; Sawidis 1991; Figueiredo &amp; Pais 1992; Pais \n&amp; Figueiredo 1994; Jian et al. 1997; Sawidis 1998; Fahn \n&amp; Shimony 2001; Nepi et al. 1996; Paiva &amp; Machado \n2006, 2008). Plastids, especially amyloplasts, play an \nimportant role in the production of nectar, with the starch \ntotally or partially hydrolyzed during the manifestations \nof secretory activity. Numerous mitochondria in the \nnectariferous cells are possibly related to the process \nof starch grains hydrolysis, since these organelles \nare essential to the metabolic processes involving the \nconsumption of energy. Endoplasmic reticulum is one of \nthe principal components of nectariferous cells and plays \na major role in the translocation of sugars, as well as \nbeing the site for lipid synthesis; dictyosomes are related \nto production of hydrophilic components of secretions \n(Fahn 1979, 2000; Nepi 2007).\n\nThe cytological characteristics of the H. \npernambucensis nectary parenchyma including many \nmitochondria, extensive endoplasmic reticulum, the \npresence of vesicles and numerous plasmodesmata \nsuggest the participation of this region of the nectary \nin the process of unloading of sugars originated from \nthe phloem, as well as in the cell-to-cell transport of the \nnectar precursors. This mechanism of transport favors \nthe enrichment of the pre-nectar, which is transported \nvia plasmodesmata to the secretory trichomes (Wergin \net al. 1975, Gunning &amp; Hughes 1976, Durkee 1983, \nEleftheriou &amp; Hall 1983, Kronestedt et al. 1986, Sawidis \net al. 1987a, b, 1989, Fahn 2000, Sawidis 1991, 1998). \nThe considerable development of the endoplasmic \nreticulum in the parenchyma cells of H. pernambucensis \nis matching with the EFNs of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis \n(Sawidis et al. 1989, Sawidis 1991) and, according to \nthese authors, this is the principal cellular component \ninvolved in the transport of the pre-nectar. \n\nAs described in other species of Malvaceae (Sawidis \net al. 1987a, Sawidis 1991), in H. pernambucensis, after \nentering the trichomes, pre-nectar fl ows from cell to \ncell via plasmodesmata reaching the apical cell; the \napoplastic route is impeded by a strong cutinization of \nthe lateral walls of the trichome stalk cells. In addition, \npresence of a very elaborate system of membranes as \n\nplasmodesmata, endoplasmic reticulum, dictyosomes and \nvesicles are evidences of the symplastic route for nectar \ntransportation. Final modifi cation of the nectar occurs \nwithin the trichome cells and, in H. pernambucensis, \nwell-developed dictyosomes and endoplasmic reticulum \nare involved in this process. Presence of vesicles in the \nouter cytoplasm and images suggesting vesicle fusions \nwith the plasmallema are evidence of granulocrine \nsecretion, and seem to be the cause of the sinuosity \nobserved in this membrane (Machado et al. 2006). In \nH. pernambucensis it is likely that the nectar is then \nsecreted into the small periplasmic spaces which are \ncommonly observed in the trichome body and apical \ncells. After, having crossed the outer tangential wall \nthe nectar accumulates beneath the cuticle. Absence of \ncuticle rupture may indicate that the cuticle is permeable \nto nectar, as has pointed for a number of other species \n(Stpiczynska et al. 2005).\n\nIt is likely that the release of the secretion to the \nsurface of H. pernambucensis extrafl oral nectary occurs \nalso through microchannels; these are seen as wide \nelectron-dense bands of a pectic nature in the outer \npericlinal wall of the palisade-like epidermal cells. \nMicrochannels emerging as fi brillar outgrowths of the \nouter epidermal cell wall were reported in Abutilon sp. by \nKronestedt et al. (1986). In H. pernambucensis, the wall \npectin bands can act as hydrophilic fi ller, increasing the \nporosity of the wall to macromolecules (Taiz &amp; Zeiger \n1998), thus constituting an apoplastic exit route of the \nnectar to the nectary surface.\n\nThe presence of idioblasts with mucilage in the inner \nparenchyma region of H. pernambucensis nectary, due to \nits hydrophilic properties, helps maintain the relatively \nwater potential of nectary tissues (Sawidis 1998). As \na consequence, increases the capacity of the nectaries \nto store water and this in turn improves its longevity. \nA remarkable feature of the extrafl oral nectary of H. \npernambucensis is that the nectar secretion period is \nprolonged, since secretion starts in very young leaves \nand remains up to completely expanded leaves. Similar \ndata were reported on fl oral nectaries of Orchidaceae \nspecies (Stpiczynska et al. 2005).\n\nIn summary, the extrafl oral nectary of H. \npernambucensis has a number of common characteristics \nto other Malvaceae species. This study indicates that \nepidermal cells that constitute the border of the nectary \nfurrow are involved in nectar production and secretion, \nbesides the secretory trichomes and the subglandular \nparenchyma tissue. Although relevant fi eld data are \nnot available, the prolonged nectar secretion suggests \nthat extrafl oral nectaries in this species constitute an \n\n\n\n Revista Brasil.

Nevertheless, a \nlong-term study is necessary to evaluate the role of the \nEFNs in the H. pernambucensis-ant interactions and the \nfactors that infl uence and determine this nectar secretion \npattern.\n\nAcknowledgments \u2013 Research was carried out using facilities \nof the Centro de Microscopia Eletr\u00f4nica and Departamento \nde Bot\u00e2nica, Instituto de Bioci\u00eancias, Universidade Estadual \nPaulista (UNESP) at Botucatu Campus, S\u00e3o Paulo State, \nBrazil, and supported by Capes/PICDT-UFRRJ, CNPq and \nFapesp.
