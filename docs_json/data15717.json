The ESE-WNW \n\ntrending Sergipano Fold Belt is a subgreenschist to amphibolite grade metavolcano-\n\nsedimemary wedge polydeformed during the 700-600Ma Brasiliano-Pan-African \n\norogeny. Crystalline basement gneiss domes mantled by metasediments are found \n\nwithin the fold belt which lies between the Sao Francisco Craton in the south and the \n\nPernambuco-Alagoas Massif to the north. An area of 4000km2 surrounding the \n\nItabaiana and Simao Dias gneiss domes was mapped at 1:50,000 scale. \n\nA new stratigraphy has been established for this part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\nTwo major Middle to Late Proterozoic sedimentary cycles have been recognised, each \n\nwith a basal siliciclastic megasequence overlain by a carbonate megasequence. Four \n\nmain stratigraphic groups have been established. The =330m thick Estancia Group \nconsisting of metasandstones, pelites, and metacarbonates unconformably overlies the \n\ncrystalline rocks of the craton and is laterally equivalent to the =200-1100m thick Miaba \n\nGroup which consists of the Itabaiana quartzites; the Ribeiropolis phyllites, pebbly \n\nphyllites, diamictites and metavolcanics; and the Jacoca metacarbonates. The Miaba \n\nGroup is unconformably deposited around the gneiss domes. The =700m thick Lagarto \n\nGroup has been identified as a new lithotectonic element in the southern part of the \n\nSergipano Fold Belt. This group is a coarsening-upward siliciclastic sequence that \n\noverlies the older rocks of both the craton and the fold belt. It consists of the Lagarto-\n\nPalmares mud stones, silts tones, sandstones and lithic wackes together with the Jacare \n\nmetasiltites and the Frei Paulo phyllites, metarhythmites, metagreywackes, minor \n\nmetacarbonates and metavolcanics. The =200-2000m thick Vaza Barns Group, \n\nconsisting of the Palestina diamictites and the Olhos D'\u00e1gua metacarbonates, \n\nunconformably overlies the older rocks to the north of the Itaporanga fault. \n\nThe thickest Palestina diamictites occur in a WNW-ESE trending, fault-bounded \n\ndepocentre which also received relatively deep water accumulations of the other \n\nformations. The siliciclastics generally thin towards the basement gneiss domes, \n\nwhereas the carbonates thin away from the domes into the diamictite trough. The \n\nthickness and facies distributions of these units indicate tectonically controlled \n\nsedimentation, with basement highs supplying sediments from both the southern and \n\nnorthern margins of an asymmetric basin. \nThe structure of the Itabaiana Dome Area is dominated by shallowly plunging, \n\nSSW vergent Fj and F2 recumbent to inclined folds and steep D2 thrust faults. D1 is \ncharacterised by WNW-ESE trending, SW vergent, nappe-like folds associated with a \npenetrative layer-parallel foliation. D2 is characterised by co-axial, up-right, tight and \nWNW-ESE trending folds, associated with penetrative axial surface foliations, lineations \nand high-angle, SSW vergent, oblique slip thrust faults. These regional thrust faults are \nprobably inverted extensional faults. Late-stage, orogen-parallel movement generated \ntransverse F3 kink-style folding and rotation of fault bounded domains. \n\nRegional lithostructural correlations between the southern and northern parts of \nthe Sergipano Fold Belt indicate that the Sergipano Basin may be interpreted to have \n\nii \n\n\n\nbeen a WNW-ESE striking half graben that deepened towards the ENE. It was infilled \nby miogeoclinal-eugeoclinal sediments and evolved axially into a small oceanic basin, \ntermed the Caninde sea, in its northeastern part. The preferred tectonic model for the \nevolution of the Sergipano Basin is that of a linked system of listric extensional faults \nthat merged into a basal detachment with a ramp-flat geometry. Inversion of this \nextensional fault system due to oblique collision of the Borborema Province to the north \nwith the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton to the south, produced sinistral transpression of the \nsedimentary wedge of the Sergipano Basin and resulted in the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\nThe tectonic and stratigraphic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt is similar to \nthat found in other Brasiliano and Pan-African mobile belts. In particular the correlation \nof stratigraphy from the craton into the fold belt, the interpretation of sedimentation \ncontrolled by extensional tectonics suggest a model of basin formation by extension of \nthe craton margins, development of pericratonic and small ocean basins which were then \ndeformed by collision of continental fragments against the craton margins. This model \nagrees with those postulated of a supercontinent that evolved by fragmentation and \namalgamation along long-lived zones of lithosphere weakness throughout the \nProterozoic. \n\niii \n\n\n\nDedication \n\nI dedicate this PhD thesis to my family, my wife Irene, my daughter Manuela, \nand to my sons Alexandre and Henrique. The support and criticism that 1 received from \nmy family were fundamental in enabling me to complete this thesis. In particular the \nloyal and unfailing support of my wife Irene was the pillar upon which I leant \nthroughout this research programme. For them, and for everyone who helped me in \nways large and small I ask God's blessing. \n\n\n\nA c k n o w l e d g e m e n t s \n\nThis thesis has only been made possible because of the financial help I have been \n\ngiven from different funding agencies and people, and because of the fundamental \n\nassistance that I have received from many persons, both in Brazil and in Britain.

The Sergipano Fold Belt forms part of the Borborema Province, at its southern \nborder with the Sao Francisco Craton (Fig. 1.1; Almeida et al. 1977). \n\nThe polydeformed and poly metamorphosed Late Proterozoic Sergipano Fold Belt \ntrends ESE-WNW and its tectonic evolution is ascribed to the 900-600Ma old Brasiliano \norogeny (Brito Neves &amp; Cordani 1973; Brito Neves et al. 1977a). The southern part of \nthis belt consists of folded and thrust faulted low- to mid-green schist facies \nmetasediments (quartzites, phyllites, diamictites and carbonates) overlying a 2100-\n1800Ma old granite-gneiss basement. This basement crops out in two structural domes, \nthe Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias domes, which are mantled by the metasediments. \n\nThis thesis is principally concerned with the structural and stratigraphic \nrelationships and Brasikano-age geological evolution of these cover and basement rocks. \n\n1.2 - Regional geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt \n\nThe Borborema Province (Fig. 1.2) is a mosaic of Archean to Early Proterozoic \ngranitic, gneissic and migmatitic terranes with several NE-SW, E-W and WNW-ESE \nstriking mobile belts. The province was consolidated during the 900-600 Ma Brasiliano \nthermo-tectonic cycle, which was also characterised by intense granite emplacement \n(Brito Neves 1975; Santos &amp; Brito Neves 1984). \n\nThe structural grain of the Borborema Province is cross-cut by two E-W striking \nshear zones known as the Patos and Pernambuco lineaments. The age of these crastal-\nscale lineaments is not fully determined, but the Patos Shear Zone has been associated \nwith the 700-500Ma old Brasiliano tectonic evolution of the Serido Fold Belt (Corsini et \nal. 1991) and the Pernambuco Shear Zone has been associated with Brasiliano cycle \nreactivation of the Transamazonic-age Riacho do Pontal Fold Belt (Fig. 1.2; Gomes \n1990). \n\nThe Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif lies to the south of the Pernambuco Shear \nZone. The Sergipano Fold Belt lies further south, between this massif and the Sao \nFrancisco Craton. \n\nThe Sao Francisco Craton was fully consolidated by the end of the 2100-1800 \nMa old Transamazonian tectonic cycle and is the largest surface extent of Archean rocks \nin Brazil (Mascarenhas et al. 1984; Teixeira &amp; Figueiredo 1991). It consists largely of \nupper amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphic terranes, subsequently affected by \ngranite emplacement and large-scale fracturing during the Brasiliano event. The Sao \nFrancisco Craton is surrounded by five fold belts which display a centreward \nconvergence of tectonic transport direction (Fig. 1.2; Mascarenhas et al. 1984). \n\ni \n\n\n\nStructural Provinces of Brazil \n\nFigure 1.1 - The Sergipano Fold Belt (in black) and the main \nstructural provinces of Brazil. \n\n(modified from Almeida et al. 1977). \n\n2 \n\n\n\nThe triangular-shaped Sergipano Fold Belt is transected by several ESE-WNW \ntrending thrust and strike-slip faults (Fig. 1.3). The belt is 200km wide along its \nboundary with the Sergipe-Alagoas Mesozoic Basin, and stretches for about 400km to \nits western extremity (Brito Neves et al. 1977 a). It is cross-cut by the N-S to SW-NE \ntrending Tucano-Jatoba Mesozoic basin, and is limited to the north by the Pernambuco \nShear Zone. \n\nThe Sergipano Fold Belt is comprised of three main domains that define three \nmajor lithotectonic assemblages: the Est\u00e2ncia, Miaba-Vaza Barris and Macurur\u00a3 Groups \n(from south to north in Fig. 1.3). These groups were interpreted by Silva Filho et al. \n(1978 a &amp; b) as cratonic cover, and the fault-bounded miogeocline and eugeocline, \nrespectively, whereas Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp; Santos (1989) considered \nthem to represent cratonic, supra, and mid- to infra-crustal structural levels. The Sao \nMiguel do Ateixo fault separates the southern and northern parts of the Sergipano Fold \nBelt (Davison &amp; Santos 1989). \n\nThe northern part of the belt corresponds to the Macurure Group and comprises \npolydeformed, greenschist to upper amphibolite facies siliciclastic and carbonate \nmetasediments, migmatites, acid and basic volcanics, and basic-ultrabasic intrusive \nrocks, all intruded by a series of 850-600Ma syn- and post-tectonic granites. \n\nThe southern part of the belt consists of the polydeformed, greenschist facies \nsiliciclastic and carbonate metasediments of the Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups, and the \nalmost undeformed and non-metamorphosed cratonic sediments situated to the south of \nthe Itaporanga fault (Estancia Group). \n\nThe crystalline basement occurs as inliers in both the southern and northern parts \nof the belt. The inliers in the southern part are the Itabaiana and Simao Dias domes \n(within the Itabaiana Dome Area, Fig. 1.3), and a gneissic structure which is enclosed in \nthe western corner of the belt (Brito Neves &amp; Cordani 1973; Brito Neves et al. 1977 a; \nGava et al. 1983). \n\nThe structure of the Sergipano Fold Belt is characterised by penetrative fold and \nfoliation development, with associated WNW-ESE striking thrust and strike-slip faults. \nMetamorphism ranges from sub-greenschist to greenschist facies in the southern \ndomain, and from greenschist to amphibolite facies in the northern part of the belt \n(Jardim de Sa\" et al. 1981, 1986; Brito Neves et al. 1987a &amp; b; Santos et al. 1988; \nDavison &amp; Santos 1989). \n\nThe Sergipano Fold Belt has been mapped at 1:250,000 scale (Gava et al. 1983). \nIn addition, its central area has been mapped at 1:100,000 scale (see the Carira Project, \nFig. 1.4 A), and part of Itabaiana Dome Area has been mapped at 1:40,000 scale \n(Humphrey &amp; Allard 1967, 1969). \n\nThe detailed sedimentary, stratigraphic and structural relationships, and the \ntectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt are poorly understood. These problems are \naddressed in this thesis. \n\n3 \n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 - Simplified geological map of eastern Brazil to show the Sao \nFrancisco craton and the surrounding Pan-African-Brasiliano fold bolts. The \ncentreward convergences of the fold and thrust belts are shown (arrows). \nThe geological and geophysical boundaries of the Sao Francisco craton are \nshown. The Sergipano Fold Belt is outlined in black (based on Wernick et al. \n1978; and on Mascarenhas et al. 1984). \n\n4 \n\n\n\nFigure 1.3 - Simplified geological map of the Sergipano Fold Belt \n(compiled from Gava et al. 1983, Jardim de Sa et. 1986, \nSantos et al. 1988, and Davison &amp; Santos 1989). \n\n5 \n\n\n\n1.3 - Aims of this thesis \n\nThis thesis details die results of research based on geological mapping in the area \n\noudined in Figure 1.4, which covers approximately 4000km2. \n\nThe aims of this research programme were: \n\n1 - To undertake a detailed analysis of the sedimentological and stratigraphic \nevolution of the Itabaiana Dome Area (Fig. 1.3). \n\n2 - To undertake a detailed analysis of mesoscopic and microscopic structures, \nand to determine the tectonic evolution of the area. \n\n3 - To present an analysis of the stratigraphic and structural evolution of the entire \nsouthern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, by combining die data collected in the field area \nwith data obtained from the literature, \n\n4 - To develop a model for the tectonic evolution of the southern part of the \nSergipano Fold Belt, from basin formation and sediment deposition to its subsequent \nclosure and incorporation in the Sergipano Fold Belt during the Brasiliano orogeny \n\n1.4 - Methodology \n\nThis research programme involved both detailed and regional geological \nmapping, together with stratigraphic and structural analysis. Thin section petrographic \nanalysis of selected samples and integration of the geophysical data from the study area \nwere also carried out. \n\nField work \n\nA total of 180 days were spent in the field during 1987, 1988, and 1990. \nApproximately 1200 outcrops were studied in detail. The outcrops were located on \n1:100,000 scale topographic maps (IBGE - Brazilian Institute for Geography and \nStatistics) enlarged to 1:50,000 scale. \n\nA detailed study was made of the large Capitao farm outcrop, at the junction of \nthe Salgado and Vaza Barris rivers (Fig. 1.4). This outcrop was mapped at 1:100 scale. \n\nAbout eighty aerial photographs (SACS, Brazil, 1971, 1:70,000 scale) were \nstudied in detail, to determine the continuity of the units within the area, the nature of \ncontacts, the trends of foliations and other structures. The results were also incorporated \nin the geological map of the Itabaiana Dome Area. \n\nLaboratory work \n\n3,200 structural measurements were made in the Field, including the orientation \nof bedding, foliations, lineations and fold axes. About 140 rock samples were cut into \n220 thin sections, which form the basis of detailed petrographic, sedimentary and \nstructural studies. The majority of the thin sections were oriented for structural analysis. \nThe length of about 1890 axes of clasts from diamictites and pebbly phyllites were \ndetermined; 750 measured directly from outcrops, and 1140 measured from 38 oriented \nthin sections. \n\n6 \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFigure 1.4 - Location and main geographical features of the thesis area. \n\n\n\nGeophysical work \nThe geophysical data used in this study includes gravity, magnetic and \n\nscintillometer data. These data were collected by the Companhia de Pesquisas e Recursos \nMinerals (CPRM, Salvador-Bahia, Brazil) and were compiled by the geophysicist Dr. \nA.C. Motta, of the same company. Geophysical maps and sections were produced and \nthe data integrated with cross-sections. Topographic data used for gravity interpretations \nwere collected by Mr. Marcio Afonso Lima de Brito, from the Caraiba Mineracao \ncompany (CM, Salvador-Bahia, Brazil). \n\n1.5 - Previous research \nThe geological knowledge of the Sergipano Fold Belt is based upon work done \n\nby the universities of UFBa, UFRN, UFPe, USP, as well as federal and state \ncompanies such Petrobras, CPRM, EDRN, CODISE, CBPM, and Caraiba Mineracao). \nThe comprehensive and systematic geological mapping of the belt was completed in \n1977 (Brito Neves et al. 1977a). \n\nHumphrey &amp; Allard (1962, 1967, 1969) described the main lithostratigraphic \nunits and established the basic elements of the geology of the area. They postulated that \nthe area evolved as an intracratonic basin in accordance with the geosyncline theory of \nAuboin (1965). Previous geological studies concerned primarily with regional geology \n(summarised by Brito Neves et al. 1977a). \n\nSantos &amp; Silva Filho (1975), Silva Filho et al. (1978 a &amp; b), Silva Filho &amp; Brito \nNeves (1979), and Silva Filho (1982) established the basic stratigraphy of the area, and \ndivided the Sergipano Fold Belt into the cratonic, miogeocline and eugeocline \ncomponents. \n\nJardim de S\u00e1 &amp; Calheiros (1981), Jardim de Sa et al. (1981, 1986) gathered \nmuch data on the metamorphic and structural evolution.They disputed previous \ngeological models involving B-subduction zones and proposed an alternative model \ninvolving the collision of two cratonic blocks. A similar interpretation has been adopted \nby Brito Neves et al. (1977 b), Brito Neves et al. (1987) and Campos &amp; Brito Neves \n(1987). \n\nDavison (1987), Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp; Santos (1989) also studied \nthe area and interpreted the Sergipano Fold Belt as a collage of possibly exotic terranes \nproduced by an oblique collision event. \n\nThe geochronology of the belt is based on scattered Rb-Sr and K-Ar \ndeterminations (Hurley 1966; Brito Neves &amp; Coidani 1973; Brito Neves et al. 1977c; \nGava et al. 1983; Santos et al. 1988). Geophysical data from the Sergipano Fold Belt \nwere presented and interpreted by Rand et al. (1980), Santos et al. (1988), and Motta \n(1990). \n\nThe geology and geochemistry of the basic-ultrabasic Caninde' Complex, in the \nnorthern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Silva Filho 1976), has been subject of \nincreasing interest and diverging interpretations in the recent years (Blais et al. 1989; \nOliveira &amp; Tarney 1990; Bezerra et al. 1990). \n\n8 \n\n\n\nThe metallogenic potential of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt has \nbeen a subject of interest for companies such as Caraiba Minera\u00e7\u00e3o and Companhia \nBaiana de Pesquisas Minerais (Moraes et at. 1987; Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Filho &amp; Sales 1988; \nGuimar\u00e3es et al. 1991). Jardim de S\u00e1 (1986) analysed the economic geology of the \nwhole Sergipano Fold Belt, and Santos et al. (1988) presented a 1:100,000 scale \nprovisional metallogenic map of the Carira project area, based on geochemical, \nsedimentological, structural and geophysical data. \n\n1.6 - Structure of this thesis \n\nThis thesis consists of seven chapters: \n\nChapter 1 introduces the Sergipano Fold Belt and the research area. \n\nChapter 2 reviews the geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt, and places the \nthesis study area in its tectonic context. \n\nChapter 3 describes the geology of the research area and focuses on the \nstratigraphic record. A new stratigraphy for the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt \nis presented. \n\nChapter 4 describes the structural and metamorphic evolution of the mapped \narea and relates this to the evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\nC h a p t e r 5 presents an analysis of geophysical data from the southern part of \nthe Sergipano Fold Belt, and integrates this with the geological data. \n\nChapter 6 describes the geological evolution of the research area, and develops \na model for the tectonic and stratigraphic evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano \nFold Belt. This is integrated with the geology of the northern part of the Sergipano Fold \nBelt, and implications for the evolution of other Proterozoic fold belts are discussed. \n\nChapter 7 presents the conclusions of this research and recommendations for \nfuture research. \n\n9 \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Regional Geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt \n\n2.1 - Aims \n\nThis chapter aims: \n\n1 - To present an uptodate review of the regional geology of the Sergipano Fold \nBelt, based on the current literature, with emphasis on the geology of the southern part \nof the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\n3 - To emphasise the importance of the area of this thesis in the understanding of \nthe southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\n4 - To highlight the problems that will be addressed in the body of this thesis. \n\n2.2 - Introduction \n\n2.2.1 - Regional setting \n\nThe Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 2.1) lies between the granulites and the \namphibolite-grade gneisses of the northern part of the Sao Francisco Craton to the south, \nand the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif to the north (Mascarenhas et al. 1984; Santos &amp; \nBrito Neves 1984). \n\nThe Borborema Province consists of SW-NE trending Archean to Early \nProterozoic granite-gneiss migmatitic regions (originally named massif by Brito Neves \n1975). The massifs have been reworked by the 900-600 Ma Brasiliano thermo tectonic \nevents responsible for the ultimate evolution of the mobile zones (Santos &amp; Brito Neves \n1984; Brito Neves 1986). Some of the mobile belts, however, also show evidence of an \nearly evolution starting in the 2100-1800Ma Transamazonic cycle (Jardim de Sa et al. \n1988; Jardim de S\u00e1 1988). \n\nThe northern part of the Sao Francisco Craton (Fig. 2.1) is comprised of \nArchean to Early Proterozoic high-grade gneisses and Early Proterozoic mobile belts, \nwhich include high-grade metamorphic rocks, low-grade supra-crustals rocks and \ngranite-greenstone sequences (Inda &amp; Barbosa 1982). \n\n2.2.2 - The Sergipano Fold Belt \nHumphrey &amp; Allard (1962,1967,1968,1969), Allard &amp; Hurst (1969), and Allard \n\n(1969) first described the Sergipano Fold Belt, at that time named the Propria \ngeosyncline (Fig. 2.2). \n\nIt consisted of a horst of Late Proterozoic, WNW-ESE trending, metavolcanic-\nsedimentary rocks separated from the Tucano and Sergipe-AIagoas Mesozoic basins, by \nthe Tobias Barreto and Propria normal faults. These authors also described the basic \nlithostratigraphy, based on detailed studies carried out mainly around the Itabaiana dome. \n\nHumphrey &amp; Allard (1967,1969) characterised five main structural elements \nwithin the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 2.2): \n\n10 \n\n\n\n1\n1\n \n\n\n\n1- The crystalline basement cropping out mainly in the Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias \ndomes. \n\n2- The metavolcano-sedimentary wedge comprising two laterally-equivalent \ngroups (the miogeoclinal Miaba Group, unconformably deposited around the basement \ndomes, and the eugeoclinal Vaza Barris Group). \n\n3- The Gl\u00f3ria batholhh: a suite of granodioritic to quartz-monzonitic plutons \nsurrounded by biotite-garnet hornfelses derived from the Vaza Barris Group. \n\n4- Thrusts and small- to large-scale, overturned, nappe-like folds, both indicating \na southward tectonic transport. \n\n5- The Est\u00e2ncia Formation (siliciclastic and carbonate sediments), unconformably \ndeposited in the craton. \n\nBarbosa (1970) studied the Sergipano Fold Belt to the west of the Tucano basin, \nand described a Precambrian to Ordovician lithostratigraphy consisting of the Macurur\u00e9, \nCanudos and Bambui Groups (shown together in Fig. 2.2). The Macurur\u00e9 Group \n(paragneisses, micaschists and quartzites) is unconformably overlain by the Canudos \nGroup (phyllites, metacarbonates and carbonaceous schists), which is in turn \nunconformably overlain by the Bambui Group (metacarbonates). \n\nHowever, Jordan (1971) showed that the Bambui and Canudos Groups are \nlaterally equivalent, and proposed that the Macurur\u00e9 group consists of two parts, one \nunderlying and the other overlying these two equivalent groups. \n\nThe >900Ma old Bambui sediments (Misi 1976) form an extensive blanket of \ncarbonate and siliciclastic sediments that covers large part of the surface of the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco Craton (see heavy dotted pattern, Fig. 2.1). These sediments form a Late \nProterozoic platformal sequence which has been partially deformed during the Brasiliano \norogeny (Mascarenhas et al. 1984; Inda &amp; Barbosa 1982; Teixeira &amp; Figueiredo 1991) \n\nHumphrey &amp; Allard (1967, 1969) also mapped part of the belt situated to the \nwest of the Tucano basin, analysed data from oil wells, and demonstrated the continuity \nof the metasediments underneath the Tucano and Sergipe-Alagoas Mesozoic basins, and \ncorrelated the metasediments to the east and west of the Tucano basin (Fig. 2.2). \n\nAllard (1969) and Allard &amp; Hurst (1969) carried out geological mapping in part \nof the western side of Gabon, in Africa, and correlated the Vaza Barris group, defined in \nthe horst of the Sergipano Fold Belt, with the Nadjol\u00e9 schists in the African continent. \n\nAfter three decades of regional and detailed studies, the geological map (Fig. 2.3) \nof the Sergipano Fold Belt shows a substantially improved geology consisting of a much \nmore complex distribution of lithologies dominated by an array of regional faults starting \nin the western apex of the belt (the Macurur\u00e9, Canudos and Bendeng\u00f3 faults) and \nextending to the east of the Tucano-Jatob\u00e1 basins (the Itaporanga, S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo, \nBelo Monte-Jeremoabo, and Jacar\u00e9 dos Homens faults). \n\nApart from the Bendeng\u00f3 and Canudos faults (names adopted here), all the fault \nnames have been taken from Gava et al. (1983), Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp; \nSantos (1989). \n\nSantos &amp; Silva Filho (1975), Silva Filho et al.(1978 a &amp; b), Silva Filho &amp; Brito \n\nNeves (1979), and Silva Filho (1982), defined the basic stratigraphy of the belt (see \n\n12 \n\n\n\n13 \n\n\n\nlegend of Fig. 2.3), consisting of the laterally continuous, Est\u00e2ncia Group, the \nmiogeoclinal Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups, and the eugeoclinal Macurur\u00e9 Group \n(including slices of basement rocks, and the mafic-ultramafic, volcanic and intrusive \nCanind\u00e9 Complex of Silva Filho 1976). \n\nThese authors also defined two younger formations: the Palmares sandstones \noverlying the cratonic Est\u00e2ncia Group, and the Ju\u00e1 conglomerates and sandstones which \ninfill a small graben within the Macurur\u00e9 Group. \n\nFollowing their regional synthesis, the Est\u00e2ncia, Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups \nhave been considered equivalent to the Bambui Group (Misi 1976; Silva Filho et al. \n1978 a &amp; b), a correlation widely accepted in the literature, at least between the cratonic \nEst\u00e2ncia and Bambui Groups (Inda &amp; Barbosa 1982; Gava et al. 1983; Mascarenhas et \nal. 1984; Teixeira &amp; Figueiredo 1991). \n\nMany other authors argued for the lateral continuity within the cratonic, \nmiogeocline and eugeocline domains, and adopted models of a tectonic evolution mainly \nbased upon a frontal collision between the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco Craton (Rand et al. 1980; Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1981; Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986; \nCampos Neto &amp; Brito Neves 1987). \n\nDavison (1987) proposed a model of transpressional and oblique collision, and \nwith more detailed studies by Santos et al. (1988), which resulted in the mapping of \nareas of high grade gneisses and acid-intermediary metavolcanics within the northern \ndomain (Fig. 2.3), Davison &amp; Santos (1989) proposed to divide the Sergipano Fold Belt \ninto the northern and southern parts, separated by the S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo fault, and \nthat the belt could be the result of the collage of possible allochthonous, fault-bounded \ndomains (possibly terranes). \n\nThe tectonic evolution of the whole Sergipano Fold Belt is attributed to a \nBrasiliano ( 600Ma old) collisional event between the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and \nthe S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Davison &amp; Santos 1989). \n\n2.3 - Litho-stratigraphic units of the northern part of the Sergipano Fold \nBelt \n\nThe northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt is comprised of the Macurur\u00e9, \nCanind\u00e9, Po\u00e7o Redondo and Maranc\u00f3 Domains (Santos et al. 1988; Davison &amp; Santos \n1989). \n\nThe Macurur\u00e9 Domain contains metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the \nMacucur\u00e9 Group, and also the sediments of the Ju\u00e1 Formation and intrusive granites. \n\nThe Canind\u00e9 and the Maranc\u00f3 Domains contain rocks of mid- to infra-crustal \naffinities, and correspond to the Canind\u00e9 and Maranc\u00f3 Complexes (Fig. 2.3). \n\nThe Canind\u00e9 Domain lies to the north of the Canind\u00e9 village and is cut by the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco river. The Maranc\u00f3 Domain lies to the south of the Po\u00e7o Redondo village, and \nis bounded to the south by the Belo Monte-Jeremoabo fault (Fig. 2.3). \n\n--------------------\nOverleaf: Legend of the geological map of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 2.3). \n\n14 \n\n\n\nL E G E N D - Figure 2.3 \n\nData from Silva Filho et al. (1978 a &amp; b); Silva Filho &amp; Brito Neves (1979); Gava et a!. (1983); \nJardim de S\u00e1 et al. (1986); Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp; Santos (1989). The relative \npositions of the Canind\u00e9 and Maranc\u00f3 Complexes do not mean any age relationship. \n\n\n\nFigure 2.3 - Geological \nmap of the Sergipano Fold \nBelt. Section lines AA', BB', \nCC', DEFG and HH' correspond \nto the cross sections in \nFigure 2.6. (Based on several \nauthors, as in the LEGEND). \n\n\n\nThe Po\u00e7o Redondo Domain occupies the faulted bounded area between the \nCan\u00ednd\u00e9 and Po\u00e7o Redondo villages and the border with the Tucano basin (Fig. 2.3). \n\nThe Macucur\u00e9 G r o u p is comprised of the Santa Cruz and the Traipu-\nJaramataia formations. The Santa Crux Formation consists of white micaceous \nquartzites (Leite 1969) that surround a basement dome in the northern part of the belt \n(Fig. 2.3) and are conformably overlain by the Traipu-Jaramataia Formation. \n\nThe T r a i p u - J a r a m a t a i a F o r m a t i o n consists of mica schists, \nmetagreywackes, phyllites, lenses of quartzites and marbles, especially in the western \nside of the northern part of the belt (Silva Filho et al. 1978a; Silva Filho &amp; Brito Neves \n1979). \n\nIntercalations of calc-silicatic rocks, amphibolites and basic metavolcanics are \ndescribed to the northeastern end of the belt (Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1981), whereas in the \ncentral area, Santos et al. (1988) identified phyllites, metasiltites, metagreywackes, \nmylonitic quartzites, mylonitic chlorite-quartz, biotite-garnet and staurolite-garnet \nschists, metadacites and porphyry metadacites. \n\nThe J u \u00e1 Formation consists of conglomerates, greywackes, and arkoses with \nclasts derived from rocks situated to the north of the Ju\u00e1 graben (Santos et al, 1988). \n\nThe C a n i n d \u00e9 Complex (Silva Filho 1976) consists of gabbros, basalts, \nultrabasic schists, felsic lavas intercalated with lenses of the Santa Cruz quartzites, and \nalso with Traipu-Jaramataia marbles, meta-arkoses and graphite phyllites. \n\nThe Maranc\u00f3 Domain (metarhyolitic and metadacitic lavas, interleaved with \ntwo sub-concordant serpentinised ulrramafic bodies and minor metasediments of the \nMacurur\u00e9 Group). The Canind\u00e9 and Maranc\u00f3 Domains are intruded by syn and post-\ntectonic granites. \n\nThe Po\u00e7o Redondo Domain consists of migmatitic gneisses intruded by syn \nand post-tectonic granites. \n\nThe Granites form a calc-alkaline series of late- to post-tectonic intrusions \nrelative to the F2 folding phase (Santos et al. 1988). They consist of granodiorites, \ndiorite-monzonites and granites (Humphrey &amp; Allard 1967, 1969; Silva Filho et al. \n1978a; Gava et al. 1983; Giuliani &amp; Santos 1988; Fujimori 1989). \n\nThe geochemistry of the rare earth and major elements of the main plutons (e.g. \nthose surrounding the Carira town, Fig. 2.3) suggests that the magmas are co-genetic, \nand were intruded at depths of 9 -10 km (Giuliani &amp; Santos 1988; Santos et al. 1988) \nunder pressures around 5 kbar (Fujimori 1989). \n\nGiuliani &amp; Santos (1988) discussed the origin of these granites, and interpreted \nthe magmas as probably originated from the partial melt of the upper mantle (eclogites) \nwith strong contribution of the lower continental crust (granulites). \n\nFujimori (1989) argue that the granodiorites of the Sergipano Fold Belt have a \nmantle origin and geochemical signature of volcanic arcs, whereas the alkaline granites \nprobably represent the syn-collisional stage. \n\nOther Brasiliano-age granitic bodies intruded in the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif \n(Brito Neves et al. 1977 a &amp; b) have a syenitic to quartz-monzonitic composition and \ncommonly contain xenoliths of basic rocks (Gava et al. 1983; Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986). \n\n16 \n\n\n\n2.4 - Stratigraphy of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt \nThe southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig, 2.4) is comprised of the \n\ncratonic Domain, where the Est\u00e2ncia Group is deposited, and the supra-crustal Domain, \nwhere the Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups are deposited. \n\n2.4.1 - The Est\u00e2ncia Group \nThe Est\u00e2ncia Group in the region to the south of Itabaiana (Silva Filho et al. 197S \n\nb; Silva Filho 1982) consists of a 1km-thick sequence of continental to shallow marine \nsiliciclastic and carbonates, divided into the Juet\u00e9, Acau\u00e3 and Lagarto Formations. This \nis unconformably overlain by the Palmares sandstones. \n\nIn an area 100 km to the south of Itabaiana, Saes (1984) documented in detail a \ngradual passage between the Lagarto and Palmares formations and described a 3km-\nthick Est\u00e2ncia Group (Fig. 2.5 A). \n\nThe Juet\u00e9 Formation consists of laminated sandstones, with conglomeratic \nlenses of basement derived clasts, and brown to red argillites. The top is marked by red-\nbrown to purple, fine to medium grained feldspathic sandstones with clasts of red \nargillites. \n\nThe Acau\u00e3 Formation is conformably deposited on the Juet\u00e9 Formation, and \nunconformably overlies the basement gneisses. It is comprised of basal limestones and \ndolomites, calcitic argillites with lenses of limestones, overlain by limestones and \ndolomites with thin intercalations of fine grained, cross bedded, red sandstones and \ngreen argillites. \n\nThe Lagarto Formation generally conformably overlies the Acau\u00e3 Formation, \nthe basal contact is locally erosive with the Acau\u00e3 carbonates, or it is even in fault contact \nwith the crystalline basement. \n\nThis formation consists of conglomeratic basal sandstones with intercalations of \nred argillites and siltites, passing upward to green and brown siltites and to calcite \ncemented, fine sandstones and wackes with small- to meso-scale tabular cross \nstratification. \n\nThe Palmares Formation is typically green, mostly medium grained, well-\ncemented arkosic sandstones with intercalations of locally pebbly lithic greywackes, \nwhich have fragments of quartz, feldspars, quartzites and phyllites. \n\nThe contact with the Lagarto sandstones is generally gradual, although a breccia \nwith fragments of carbonates, and lenses of polimictic conglomerates are found locally \nalong this contact. \n\n2.4.2 - The Miaba Group \nThe Miaba Group (Fig. 2.5 B) is comprised of the Itabaiana, Jacarecica, and \n\nJacoca Formations. The Miaba Group is probably as thick as 1 km (Humphrey &amp; Allard \n1969; Silva Filho et al. 1978 a &amp; b; Davison &amp; Santos 1989) \n\nThe Itabaiana Formation (200-600m thick) unconformably overlies the \ncrystalline basement, and consists of arkosic basal quartzites (locally conglomeratic) \npassing upward to quartzites with small- to meso-scale cross bedding. \n\n17 \n\n\n\nFigure 2.4 - Simplified geol\u00f3gical map of the southeastern Sergipano Fold \nBelt (Modified from Silva Filho et al. 1979; Davison a Santos 1939). \n\n18 \n\n\n\nFigure 2.5 - Stratigraphic columns of (A): the Est\u00e2ncia Group, \nand (B): the Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups. Slightly modified from \n(A) : Saes (1984), and (B): Davison &amp; Santos (1939). \n\n19 \n\n\n\nThe Jacarecica Formation (0-150m thick) unconformably overlies the \nItabaiana Formation, and consists of grey to reddish, locally conglomeratic \nmetagreywackes, white to grey metaargillites, and reddish phyllites. Some pyroclastics \nrocks may also occur in this formation. The clasts in the conglomeratic bodies are from \nbasement rocks and from the Itabaiana quartzites. In the northeastern border of the \nItabaiana dome, Humphrey &amp; Allard (1969) clasts of gneiss of up to 120cm in size. \n\nThe Jacoca Formation ( 200m thick, Humphrey &amp; Allard 1967, 1969) \nconformably overlies the Jacarecica Formation and unconformably overlies the Itabaiana \nFormation, specially around the eastern and western Itabaiana dome. It consists of \nmarbles, metadolomites, metacherts, metaargillites, limestones, marls, dark grey \nphyllites and calcitic quartz-chlorite schists. The basal part of the column locally contains \nsyn-sedimentary copper sulphide occurrences. \n\n2.4.3 - The Vaza Barris Group \nThe Vaza Barris Group is comprised of the Capit\u00e3o-Palestina, Olhos D'\u00e1gua and \n\nFrei Paulo-Ribeir\u00f3polis Formations. Generally the thicknesses are highly variable, and \nare barely estimated because of the deformation. However, it is normally accepted that \nthis group could be as thick as 3km, on the eastern side of the itabaiana dome (Davison \n&amp; Santos 1989). \n\nThe Capit\u00e3o-Palestina Formation unconformably overlies either the \nJacarecica or Jacoca Formations, and in places the crystalline basement. It shows marked \nvariations in thickness, and comprises two lithofacies: grey to green phyllites with lenses \nof metacarbonates, impure metarenites, local metabasalts and pyroclastic rocks (the \nCapit\u00e3o facies) and a second lithofacies of diamictites containing granules to boulders of \nbasement rocks, quartzites, quartz veins, carbonates and phyllites, with intercalated \nlenses of quartzites (the Palestina facies). \n\nThe Olhos D'agua Formation is a sequence of dark grey to black, \nmetalimestones, metadolomites, and intercalated variegated argillites. The carbonates are \ncommonly parallel laminated, cross bedded and probably indicate a shallow marine \ndepositional environment. Stratifera Undata stromatolites were described by Cassedane \n&amp; Silva Filho (1982), close to the Saco da Camisa locality (Fig. 2.4). \n\nThe Frei Paulo-Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation merges the original Frei Paulo and \nRibeir\u00f3polis formations of Humphrey &amp; Allard (1967, 1969) into two lithofacies. \n\nThe Frei Paulo lithofacies consists of well-foliated metasiltites and sandy \nmetasiltites passing to silty phyllites. The Ribeir\u00f3polis lithofacies consists of locally \nconglomeratic metagreywackes, meta-argillites, phyllites, metavolcanics, and lenses of \nmetarenites and metacarbonates. \n\nThe Frei Paulo lithofacies was described as having a gradual transition from the \nLagarto sandstones, close to the southern margin of the Itabaiana dome (Silva Filho et al. \n1978 a &amp; b; Silva Filho 1982), whereas in the northern part of the area (Fig. 2.4) they \nwere described as having a gradual transition from the Olhos D'\u00e1gua carbonates (Santos \net al. 1988). \n\n2 0 \n\n\n\nDespite the lateral continuity of the major formations for 350km along the WNW-\nESE strike, stratigraphic analysis by Gava et al. (1983), Moraes et ai. (1987) and \nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o Filho &amp; Sales (1988) have shown that the sedimentary units are reduced in \nthickness, or in some cases even absent in the Sergipano Fold Belt to the west of the \nTucano basin. \n\nIn the cratonic area to the west of the Tucano basin, the Juet\u00e9 Formation is almost \nabsent, and consists of local conglomeratic bodies. The Acau\u00e3 Formation is generally \ncontinuous, but the Lagarto and Palmares Formations are absent. \n\nIn the western miogeocline the Miaba Group cannot be mapped on a regional \nscale, although Humphrey &amp; Allard (1969) described thin Itabaiana quartzites and lacoca \nrnetacarbonates. The Vaza Barris Group is represented only by the Frei Paulo-\nRibeir\u00f3pol\u00eds and Capit\u00e3o-Palestina Formations. \n\n2.5 - Structures and metamorphism \n\n2.5.1 - Introduction \nThe Sergipano Fold Belt records a polyphase history of ductile to brittle-ductile \n\ndeformations (D1- D3), with involvement of the crystalline basement. \nThe deformation history is summarised in terms of two major co-axial folding \n\nphases ( F r F 2 ) associated with metamorphism (M1 and M2) together with generally \nsouthward thrusting. F2 folds are associated with the regional thrust faults, which \ngenerally have a late-stage E-W strike-slip movement. A minor, non-metamorphic, \ntransversal folding event is associated with the late-stage strike-slip movement along the \nregional faults (Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1981, Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986, Davison &amp; Santos \n1989). \n\nThe two main folding events are locally followed by a third phase of co-axial, \nopen, non penetrative and non-metamorphic folding (Campos Neto &amp; Brito Neves \n1987). \n\nDj structures are a layer-parallel foliation (S 1), and local, isoclinal to recumbent, \ngenerally rootless, and south verging F1 folds. These are co-axially refolded by the F2 \nfolds which are WNW-ESE trending, subhorizontal to gentle plunging, open to tight, \ncommonly upright to overturned folds. There is generally a NNE dipping axial planar \nfoliation (S2) associated with these folds. \n\nDj and D2 structures are locally (particularly in the northern part of the Sergipano \nFold Belt) and co-axially refolded by kink-style or cylindrical, generally open, up-right \nF3 folds. There is generally a spaced cleavage axial planar foliation (S3) associated with \nthese folds. \n\nThe F2 folds and the regional faults are the main mappable structures. The strike-\nslip movement is dextral along the faults to the west of the Tucano-Jatob\u00e1 basin, and \nsinistral in those faults to the east (Fig. 2.3; Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986; Moraes et al. 1987; \nDavison &amp; Santos 1989). \n\n21 \n\n\n\n2.5.2 - Structural and metamorphic partitioning \nIn the cratonic (Est\u00e2ncia) Domain, the sediments are mostly undeformed and \n\nunmetamorphosed, whereas the intensity of deformation increases toward the Bendeng\u00f3-\nTtaporanga fault (Fig. 2.6 A &amp; E). Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. (1986) described important F1 \nfolds associated with low-angle, southward thrusts and amphibolite facies \nmetamorphism, 20km southward onto the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, in the Patamut\u00e9 area, to \nthe west of the Tucano basin (Fig. 2.3). \n\nIn the Vaza Barris Domain, limited by the Bendeng\u00f3-Itaporanga and the \nCanudos-S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo faults, F2 and S2 are the main observed structures. S2 is \neither a spaced cleavage, or a slaty cleavage, or a quartz-sericite or chlorite-biotite \nfoliation, or a pressure solution foliation, dipping at intermediate to high angles to NNE \n(Figs. 2.6 A &amp; E). \n\nAlthough F1 folds have been identified, or inferred from structural relationships \nby Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. (1986) and Santos et ai (1988), Davison &amp; Santos (1989) argued \nfor a monophase deformation consisting generally of upright folds and thrusts in the \nsouthern Vaza Barris Domain (Figs. 2.6 B &amp; C). \n\nJardim de S\u00e1 et al. (1981) reports that from the cratonic to the Vaza Barris \nDomain, the metamorphism generally shows a gradual northward increase under sub-\n\ngreenchist to greenschist conditions, probably reaching temperatures of 300\u00b0 to 400\u00b0C, \nand pressures of 1-3 kbar, and that on the basis of mineral paragenesis of seriate, \nchlorite and biotite in the metasediments, it has not been possible to distinguish the \nmetamorphism associated with F1 and F2 folding events. \n\nA sharp metamorphic contrast is described across the central part of the S\u00e3o \nMiguel do Aleixo fault (Santos et al. 1988), but the passage is more gradual elsewhere \nbetween the southern and northern parts of the belt (Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986; Campos \nNeto &amp; Brito Neves 1987), \n\nWithin the northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, the bedding (So), the S1 and \nS2 foliations (generally defined by the preferred orientation of biotite, garnet, quartz and \nminor staurolite and kyanite) are generally shallow-angle dipping (Figs. 2.6 a &amp; B,C &amp; \nE), and are affected by gentle to open F3 folds (Brito Neves et al. 1987; Campos Neto &amp; \nBrito Neves 1987), but approaching the Belo Monte-Jeremoabo fault all the planar \nfeatures turn to near vertical or dip at high angles to NNE (Fig. 2.6 C). \n\nThe metamorphic evolution of the northern part of the belt is much more complex \nthan the southern part, and is generally described in terms of amphibolite facies, \nalthough greenschist facies mineral paragenesis dominate in the northern boundary (Brito \nNeves et al. 1987; Santos et al. 1988). \n\nJardim de S\u00e1 et al. (1981) described a greenschist to high-amphibolite facies \nmetamorphism, which probably reached silimanite and anatexis isograds, but probably \nin a low pressure regime (M1) in the northern end of the belt. M 1 was superimposed by \na new recrystallisation event under greenschist to amphibolite facies, with kyanite or \nandalusite present, indicating M2 metamorphism of probably higher pressures than M1 \n\nParticularly in the area surrounding the Carira town (Fig. 2.3) the M1 \nmetamorphism reaches a peak of high greenschist to amphibolite facies of intermediate \n\n2 2 \n\n\n\nFigure 2.6 - Cross sections of lhe Sergipano Fold Belt, Section \nlines AA', BB, CC, DEFG and HH' are shown in Figure 2.3. See text. \n\n23 \n\n\n\npressures, whereas to the far east and northeast of Carira, the S l foliation is marked by \nmuscovite and/or biotite, or by sericite/chlorite, reflecting greenschist facies metamorphic \nconditions (Jardim de S\u00e1 et ai. 1981; Santos et al. 1988). \n\nAt the northeastern end of the Sergipano Fold Belt, M 1 varies from the prehnite-\npumpellyite up to the high amphibolite metamorphic facies, and M2 is somewhat weaker, \nthough the presence of kyanite probably records a slight increasing of pressures (Jardim \nde S\u00e1 et al. 1981). \n\nIn this region (Figs. 2.6 D &amp; E), S0, S1 and S2 are flat lying and sub-parallel, \nand are co-axially refolded by open to tight, up-right to overturned, northward verging \nfolds and high-angle thrusts involving the Macurur\u00e9 Group and the crystalline basement. \nThe folds, whose axial planar foliation is marked by greenschist facies mineral \nassemblages, have been interpreted either as F3 folds (Brito Neves et al. 1987; Campos \nNeto &amp; Brito Neves 1987) or as back-folds due to back-thrusting developed during \nprogressive D2 deformation (Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986). \n\n2.6 - Geochronology \n\n2.6.1 - Age of sedimentation \nAlthough the exact age of the sedimentation in the Sergipano Fold Belt remains \n\nunknown, the sediments are generally considered to be as old as Late to Middle \nProterozoic. \n\nTwo swarms of basic dikes cut the northern margins of the S\u00e3o Francisco \nCraton. In the western part of the craton, the dikes are 2000Ma old and are \nunconformably overlain by the Est\u00e2ncia Group (Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986). In the \nsouthern pan of the craton, the dikes are 1300Ma old (Cordani 1973) and have been \ninterpreted as evidence of a phase of extension of the basement that may have been \nresponsible for the development of the basin (Silva Filho et al, 1978 a). \n\nA Late Proterozoic age of sedimentation is the most feasible interpretation for the \nmetasediments in the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, because of the >900Ma \nage for the Bambui Group (section 2.2.2). A similar argument has been applied to the \nMacurur\u00e9 Group, on the basis of syn-sedimentary tectonic processes (Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. \n1986). \n\n2.6.2 - Age of deformation and metamorphism \nIt is generally accepted that the Sergipano Fold Belt resulted from tectono-\n\nmetamorphic events that range from 900 to 600 Ma. The peak of metamorphism is dated \nbetween 673-600Ma (Brito Neves &amp; Cordani 1973; Gava et al. 1983) on the basis of \nseveral Rb-Sr and K-Ar ages. \n\nBrito Neves et al. (1977 c) presented a 23-point, 501-479 Ma range of Rb-Sr \nages (average 490Ma) obtained from clay minerals of the cratonic Lagarto sediments, \nand interpreted the data as indicative of the anchimetamorphism affecting the Est\u00e2ncia \nGroup. \n\n24 \n\n\n\nSantos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp; Santos (1989) however presented a 861-\n805Ma range of Rb-Sr ages (average 838Ma) for late to post-tectonic granites in the \nvicinities of the town of Coronel Jo\u00e3o S\u00e1 (Fig. 2.3), and argue that the Macurur\u00e9 Group \n(or the northern part of the belt) may be older than the southern part, \n\n2.7 - Geophysics of the Sergipano Fold Belt \nRand et al. (I980) made the first compilation of the gravity and magnetic data \n\nthen available for the area of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 2.7 A) and produced an \ninterpretation that the belt consisted of a continental crust formed by blocks of different \ndensities, with no evidence of any crustal thickening, including a rootless Canind\u00e9 \nComplex (Fig. 2.7 B). \n\nSantos et al. (1988) added detailed gravimetric and magnetometric data collected \nin the area of the Carira Project, and reinterpreted all data along the AA' section line (Fig. \n2.7 A). They modelled the upper crust of the northern part of the belt in terms of fault-\nbounded blocks with an intermediate composition northward of the S\u00e3o Miguel do \nAleixo fault and concluded that 1: the main regional faults are probably deep-rooted \nstructures, and 2: the Sergipano Fold Belt thickens from 3 to 13 km, in the northern end \nof the section (Fig. 2.8). \n\n2.8 - Tectonic evolution \nThe models for the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt are currently \n\nstrongly debated in the geological literature of the area. \nSilva Filho et al. (1978 a) first introduced plate tectonic concepts for \n\nunderstanding the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. They postulated a \ndoubly vergent subduction process involving two passive margin-type basins. This \nmodel was challenged by Rand et al. (1980) and Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. (1981). \n\nSilva Filho &amp; Brito Neves (1979) turned to a model which is an important \nattempt at describing the evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt by also considering the \nsedimentary record. They postulated sedimentation in a single passive margin (Fig. 2.9) \nclosed by the collision of the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\nThey described the tectonic evolution in four stages: the onset, the taphrogenic, \nthe geosynclinal, and the orogenic stages. Their model is as follows: \n\n1. The onset stage recorded the initial extension of the crust, erosion of the \nbasement highs and deposition of the Itabaiana and Santa Cruz quartzites in grabens \n(Fig. 2.9). \n\n2. The taphrogenic stage involved the continued extension of the crust, the \nerosion of the rejuvenated relief (the Jacarecica conglomerates and pebbly phyllites). The \nsubsequent thermal relaxation produced subsidence and the first marine incursion (the \nJacoca carbonates). The phase of maximum extension is recorded by the Capit\u00e3o-\nPalestina diamictites and associated volcanism. \n\n25 \n\n\n\nFigure 2.7 - (A): Bouguer anomaly map of the eastern part of the \nSergipano Fold Belt, showing the profiles AA' and BB' Values and \ncontour levels are not available in the original publication. \n(B): Profiles AA' and BB', showing the observed gravity data (g) and \nmagnetic data (m). (Modified from Rand et al. 1980). \n\n2 6 \n\n\n\nFigure 2.8 - (A) Measured and calculated gravity profiles along \na general SW - NE line across the lowest right corner of the area \nof the Carira Project (Figure 2.7). (B) Measured magnetometer \nand calculated profiles along the same general direction, as in A \n(modified from Santos et al. 1988). \n\n27 \n\n\n\nFigure 2.9 - Schematic representation of the undeformed Sergipano Fold \nBeit (see text). From Silva Filho et al. (1978a) and Silva Filho &amp; Brito \nNeves (1979). \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n3. The geosynclinal stage corresponded to the final extension of the basin, \nthermal relaxation and gradual sinking of the crust, and deposition of the third \nsedimentary cycle, in different environments: the Est\u00e2ncia Group on the platformal or \npericratonic area, the Vaza Barris Group and the top of the Macurur\u00e9 Group in the deeper \npart of the basin (Fig, 2.9). \n\n4. In the orogenic stage, the closure of the basin resulted in folding, uplift and \nerosion of the internal zones and supplied siliciclastics for the deposition of the Palmares \nand Ju\u00e1 Formations, respectively in foreland and in tramontane basins. \n\nSubsequent to the above model, although different hypotheses have been \nproduced to explain the closure of the basin, the basic stratigraphy of the southern part of \nthe Sergipano Fold Belt and its tectonic implications have not been questioned. In \nparticular, the origin of the Palmares sandstones has not been challenged. In these \nmodels the basement domes have been treated as simple tectonic slices. \n\nThese conceptual models are illustrated in Figure 2.10. The currently most \naccepted model involves collision between the S\u00e3o Francisco and the Pernambuco-\nAlagoas blocks, probably in an intracratonic setting (Fig, 2.10 C-E). \n\nJardim de S\u00e1 et ai. (1986) argued for a low-angle simple shear-thrust regime \n(Fig. 2.10 C) where the thrust stacking would explain the crustal thickening to the \nnorth, and back-thrusting would explain the northward vergence in the northern par of \nthe belt. The strike-slip movement along the main faults is the ultimate evidence of the \nprogressive shortening and locking-up of the regional folds. \n\nBrito Neves et ai. (I987) and Campos Neto &amp; Brito Neves (1987) described \nevidence of nappe structures in the whole belt and attempted to relate these structures to \ndeep-rooted crustal faults (Fig. 2.10 D). \n\nIn contrast to the above models, Davison &amp; Santos (1989) emphasises the rote of \npossible large-scale sinistral strike-slip movements along the high-angle thrusts (Fig. \n2.10 E) to juxtapose entirely different structural domains. \n\n2.9 - Plate Tectonic setting of the Sergipano Fold Belt \nThe Sergipano Fold Belt is considered part of the Pan-African-Brasiliano fold \n\nsystem, which in Brazil and Africa consists of a frame of cratons and fold belts (Fig. \n2.11 A; Brito Neves 1975; Torquato &amp; Cordani 1981; Porada 1989). As it is surrounded \nby six other cratons and five fold belts (Fig. 2.11 B) the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton appears \nto play a special role in the evolution of the entire system (Couto 1984). \n\nThe regional and wider importance of the Sergipano Fold Belt was first \nhighlighted when Allard (1969), and Allard &amp; Hurst (1969) pointed out the extreme \nsimilarity between the Vaza Barris Group and the Nadjol\u00e9 schists of Gabon, Africa, \nwhich are part of the 1300km-long West Congolian fold belt (Coward 1981 a; \nSchermerhorn 1981). Subsequently, different correlations of the Sergipano Fold Belt \nhave been proposed for its African counterparts (Cordani 1973; Torquato 1974; Torquato \n&amp; Cordani 1981; Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1981; Trompette 1982). \n\n2 9 \n\n\n\nFigure 2.10 - (A to D): General SSW-NNE \ncross sections to show different models \nthat have been proposed for the closure of \nthe Sergipano basin.

The model in \nFigure 2.12 A involves a single basin closed by a frontal collision, leading to the \nevolution of a classic fold-and-thrust belt, whereas the model in Figure 2.12 B argues \nfor an oblique collision between the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and the S\u00e3o Francisco \nCraton, with the juxtaposition of different domains due to large-scale strike-slip \nmovements along the regional faults. \n\nThe first model does not consider the existence of the basement domes cored by \nmetasediments near the foreland. The second model, although being increasingly applied \nin the current literature of fold belts and collision zones (as in Ho Ids worth &amp; Strachan \n1991), does not take into account the difference in the sense of the strike-slip movements \nalong the regional faults on both sides of the Tucano-Jatob\u00e1 basin. \n\nApart from the detailed description of the lithofacies in the Est\u00e2ncia Group (Saes \n1984; Moraes et ai. 1987; Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Filho &amp; Sales 1988) and from lithofacies analysis \nin the Vaza Barris Group, in the very southern part of the Carira Project, an area \ncomparatively poor in outcrops and with numerous fault contacts (Santos et al. 1988), \nno comprehensive and detailed study has been carried out around the Itabaiana and \nSim\u00e3o Dias domes since the research of Humphrey &amp; Allard (1967, 1968, 1969). \n\nFrom their pioneer research, several indications of a possible tectonically \ncontrolled sedimentation were given, particularly about the origin of the diamictites and \nabout the uplift of the Itabaiana dome. These indications have been renewed in a general \napproach by Silva Filho et al. (1978 a &amp; b) and Silva Filho (1982), but have never been \nlooked in detail by other researchers working in the area subsequently. \n\nThis overview obviously points to the Itabaiana Dome Area as a key if any \nreasonable contribution is to be made in the geology of the southern Sergipano Fold \nBelt, towards a better understanding of the entire belt and towards the understanding of \nthe Late Proterozoic craton-belt system of Brazil and Africa. \n\nIn fact, among the belts which surround the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, the \nSergipano Fold Belt uniquely has crystalline basement domes mantled by a relatively \npreserved low to medium grade metamorphic sequence. The Itabaiana Dome Area, \ncontains sedimentary and structural relationships best preserved than anywhere else in \nthe Sergipano Fold Belt, and is suitable for the detailed study of the basement-cover \nrelationships. These relationships are considered the key in the understanding the \ntectonic evolution of Proterozoic fold belts by Naha &amp; Mohanty (1989), who studied the \nAravalli Group in India. \n\n32 \n\n\n\n3 3 \n\nFigure 2.12 - Cartoons to illustrate the two main hypotheses for the tectonic \nevolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. (A): A continuous basin with laterally \nequivalent lithologies now imbricated by major SSW verging thrust faults \nassociated with minor strike-slip movement. (B): Basins with different lithological, \ntectono-metamorphic and magmatic characteristics, juxtaposed along major \nstrike-slip faults which result from an oblique collision. \n\n\n\n2.11 - Conclusions \n1 - The Sergipano Fold Belt resulted from the evolution of a Middle-Late \n\nProterozoic possibly intracratonic basin closed during the 900-600Ma Pan-African-\nBrasiliano orogeny. The geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt can be summarised as in \nFigure 2,12. \n\n2 - The stratigraphy of the belt (Fig. 2.12 A) is comprised of the cratonic \nEst\u00e2ncia Group, the miogeoclinal Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups, and the eugeoclinal \nMacurur\u00e9 Group. These are separated by ESE-WNW trending, regional thrust and \nstrike-slip faults. The Archean-Early Proterozoic crystalline basement crops out in the \nJirau do Ponciano mantled dome, in the northern part of the belt, and in the Itabaiana and \nSim\u00e3o Dias mantled domes, in the southern part of the belt. The first age of \nsedimentation in the southern part of the belt is more likely to have been around 1000-\n900Ma. \n\n3 - The structural evolution is generally described in terms of Fj-F2 folding \nphases associated with thrusting and greenschist up to amphibolite facies ( 650Ma old) \nmetamorphism. The main mappable structures are ESE-WNW trending, moderately \ninclined to up-right, south-southwestern verging, open to tight and gentle plunging F2 \nfolds, which co-axially refold recumbent F1 folds and/or an intense S1 foliation. The F2 \nfolds developed a pervasive, pressure solution-type axial planar foliation (S2), and is \nassociated with the ESE-WNW trending regional faults. F 1 -F 2 structures are co-axially \nrefolded by local, kink-style or cylindrical, open to tight, up-right to overturned F3 folds \nwhich have a spaced cleavage axial planar foliation. Other minor structures (transversal, \nopen to tight, upright, kink-style folds, kink bands and crenulations), are likely related to \nlate-stage strike-slip movement along the regional faults. \n\n4 - Many aspects of the geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt demand specific \nresearch, particularly the detailed study of the age of the sedimentation, the lifhostructurai \ncontinuity between the southern and northern parts of the belt, and the origin of the \nCanind\u00e9, Maranc\u00f3 and Po\u00e7o Redondo Domains. \n\n5 - This thesis aims to describe in detail the stratigraphic and structural \nrelationships of the Itabaiana Dome Area, and to describe the tectonic evolution of the \nsouthern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. Further objectives are to apply the data \nresulting from this research for the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the \nSergipano Fold Belt, and to discuss the implications for the evolution of Pan-African -\nBrasiliano fold belts, in particular, and Proterozoic fold belts in general. \n\n5 - The Itabaiana Dome Area uniquely contains two gneissic domes mantled by a \nrelatively well preserved, low grade metasedimentary sequence and basement-cover \nrelationships. The research area is so far considered the best region for such detailed \nstudies in the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\n3 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Stratigraphy of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt \n\n3.1 - Aims \n\nThis chapter aims: \n\n1 - To present the stratigraphic analysis of the Itabaiana Dome Area. \n\n2 - To present the stratigraphy of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\n3 - To discuss the implications of the data for the tectonic evolution of the \n\nSergipano Fold Belt and adjacent cratonic areas. \n\nThis chapter presents first the geology and stratigraphy of the Itabaiana Dome \n\nArea with a brief description of the formations, Hthofacies and sedimentary structures. \n\nThis is followed by an analysis of the distribution of the lithofacies and an interpretation \n\nof the sedimentary environments for the siliciclastic and the carbonate megasequences in \n\norder to highlight the implications for the paleogeography of the basin in the Itabaiana \n\nDome Area. The results of this research are combined with data from the literature, in \n\norder to erect the stratigraphy of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt and to \n\ndiscuss the implications for the evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\nThis chapter contains 22 figures (Figures 3.1-3.22), one table (Table 3.1) and \n\nadditional documentation, presented in the appendix Al (Appendices Al .1 -A 1.8). In all \n\nthe photographs hereafter, the white pen is 12cm long and the hammer 30cm long. Other \n\nscales are indicated where appropriate. \n\nThe geological map of Figure 3.1 was originally constructed at 1:50,000 scale \n\nbut is presented (enclosure) at 1:100,000 scale. It contains the names of all the relevant \n\nlocalities and the outcrops numbered 1-1217. Figure 3.1 is also presented as a summary \n\nlithostructural map in the main body of this thesis. \n\n3.2 - Introduction \n\nThe Itabaiana Dome Area is comprised of an amphibolite grade gneiss-granitic \ncomplex (the crystalline basement) outcropping in the Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itabaiana domes \nand a highly deformed greenschist grade metasedimentary sequence, mostly made up of \nquartzites, phyllites, diamictites and metacarbonates, together with generally flat lying \nsandstones (in the SSW pan of the area, Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe metasediments occur to the west of the the Propria fault, surround the two \nbasement domes and extend westward in WNW-ESE trending units. Other rocks in the \nmapped area include the Mesozoic sediments of the Sergipe-Alagoas basin, eastward of \nthe Propria fault, and a local fan of Tertiary-Quaternary debris and paraconglomerates in \nthe southern part of the Itabaiana dome (Gava et al. 1983). These were not examined in \ndetail during this study. \n\nThe Itabaiana dome is a 450km 2 elliptical dome centred around the town of \n\nItabaiana (Fig. 3.1). The dome, the longest axis of which extends for 42km in the SW-\n\nNE direction, is surrounded by the Itabaiana quartzites that outcrop in a series of \n\nprominent ranges. \n\n3 5 \n\n\n\nFigure 3.1 - Summary lithostructural map \nof the ftabaiana Dome Area. Based on the \ngeological map of Figure 3.1 (enclosure). \n\n36 \n\n\n\nThese ranges are (anticlockwise from south to west, Fig. 3.1): the Montes, \nCajueiro, Comprida, Itabaiana, Merem, Can\u00e7\u00e3o, Capunga, Machado, Saco, Cagado, \nMacambira and Miaba ranges. Figure 3.2 shows a panoramic view of the Miaba range. \nThe Sim\u00e3o Dias dome is much smaller than the Itabaiana dome and occurs in the vicinity \nof the town of Sim\u00e3o Dias and to ESE, in a narrow fault-bounded strip, \n\nThe main mappable structures are WNW-ESE or NW-SE trending thrust and \nstrike-slip faults and some major folds (Fig. 3.1). From south to north, the main faults \nare the Jacar\u00e9, Itaporanga, Sim\u00e3o Dias, Escarpa, Pelada, Mocambo, Ribeir\u00f3polis and \nDores faults (Fig. 3.1). The trace of the main strike-slip faults (the Vaza Barris and the \nMocambo shears) lies within the metasediments. The Capunga, Montes and other local \nshear zones cut across the eastern and southern borders of the Itabaiana dome. The \nmappable folds generally occur to the north of the Itaporanga fault, and are of a F2 phase \nof folding, such as the Paripiranga anticline and the sequence of folds of die Miaba range \n(Fig. 3.2). \n\nThe geological mapping was carried out on outcrops along roads and tracks, and \n\nalong several streams and rivers (Fig. 3.1): the Vaza Barris and Salgado rivers and \n\nJacoquinha stream (west of the Itabaiana dome); the Cova and Montes streams, and the \n\nLomba, Trairas and Jaearecica rivers (in the Itabaiana dome); the Sergipe and Dangra \n\nrivers and the Jacoca, Morcego and Mo\u00e7as streams (east of the dome). \n\n3.3 - Stratigraphy of the Itabaiana Dome Area \n\nThe metasedimentary cover is divided into the Miaba, Lagarto and Vaza Barris \nGroups which, together form a Mid- to Late Proterozoic, ~1000-4000m thick \nsedimentary wedge unconformably deposited on the Archaean to Early Proterozoic \nItabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias gneisses (Fig. 3.3). \n\nIn the stratigraphic column of Figure 3.3, the pattern of the formations applies to \nthe summary map of Figure 3.1, whereas the formation symbols (P\u20ac I, P\u20ac Ja, PC P, \netc) apply to the full geological map (Fig. 3.1 enclosure). \n\nThe Miaba Group comprises the Itabaiana, the Ribeir\u00f3polis and the Jacoca \nFormations. It is conformably covered by the Lagarto Group which comprises the \nLagarto-Palmares, the Jacar\u00e9 and the Frei Paulo Formations. The Vaza Barris Group \nunconformably overlies the Lagarto Group and comprises the Palestina and the Olhos \nD'\u00e1gua Formations. \n\nAlthough the computation of the thicknesses in the area is generally hampered by \n\nthe polyphase deformation, the relative variations of thickness within each formation can \n\nbe determined in some parts of the area. \n\nThe stratigraphy has been established as the result of the detailed mapping and \n\nconstruction of 12 sections across the basement-cover contact (summarised in Fig. 3.4). \n\nThe sections of lines AA' to LL' are plotted on a 1:143,000 scale copy of the \n\ngeological map of the area (Appendix A 1.1, enclosure). The sections AA', EE', GG\", \n\nJJ' correspond to Figures 3.5-3.8. The more complete stratigraphic sections are (Figs. \n\n3.5 &amp; 3.8) are AA', in the western side of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, and JJ' in the \n\n37 \n\n\n\n3\n8\n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - A panoramic view of the Miaba range as seen from the inner \nItabaiana dome, showing the Itabaiana quartzites affected by gentle to open F2 \nfolds.

The S-N distance is about 5km. \n\n\n\nFigure 3.3 - Summary stratigraphy of the Itabaiana Dome Area. The Formation \npatterns apply to the summary map (Fig. 3.1).

Sections EE' and GG' contain relevant information \nfor lateral correlation. Section LL' (Fig. 3.14) is specific for the upper part of the \nLagarto Group. Sections BB', C C , DD', FF', HH', II' and KK' contain additional \ninformation and are presented in the Appendix Al (A 1.2 to A1.8). \n\n3.3.1 - The crystalline basement \nThe crystalline basement is a Rb-Sr 2500Ma old gneissic-granitic complex \n\n(Hurley 1966). It consists of amphibolite grade, granitic to granodioritic gneisses and \northogneisses with mylonites and phyllonites derived from these lithologies. Small, \nlocal, sheet-like granitic bodies, and disrupted bodies of amphibolites, hornblende \ngabbros and gabbro pyroxenites are also evident. To the south of the Itabaiana Dome \nArea the basement gives 1800 Ma Rb-Sr ages (Brito Neves &amp; Cordani 1973; \nMascarenhas et al. 1984). \n\nThe gneisses and orthogneisses are composed of coarse-grained (=0.5cm on \naverage) quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspars, biotite (hornblende), muscovite, sericite, \nchlorite and epidote. Accessories are apatite, sphene, zircon, and opaque minerals. \nGarnet occurs locally. \n\nThe gneisses and orthogneisses are distinguished by the more or less continuous \nmetamorphic banding. The former have a laterally continuous layering defined by bands \nof medium- to coarse-grained quartz and feldspars interbanded, on a centimetric scale, \nwith biotite-muscovite-epidote (hornblende) rich bands (Fig. 3.9 A). The orthogneisses \ncommonly show an inhomogeneous and less continuous banding with 1 cm size \nfeldspar porphyroblasts which are more or less rotated and elongated according to the \nintensity of the local deformation. \n\nIn thin section, both lithologies show commonly elongated quartz grains with \nundulose extinction and saussuritised feldspars. Biotite and muscovite or sericite, and \nchlorite normally occur as fine flakes disposed along banding-parallel mica-domains. \nBiotites are transformed to chlorites along the cleavage surfaces which have associated \nwith thin Films of red-brown iron oxide. Where found, hornblende is commonly \nretrogressed to epidote. \n\nBasement-derived mylonites generally consist of a &lt;lmm fine-grained matrix \nand mm-size porphyroclasts of K-feldpars, plagioclase and epidote. They commonly \nshow S-C fabric relationships (Lister &amp; Snoke 1984). The matrix consists of \nrecrystallised quartz and feldspars grains with a preferred orientation parallel to the S \nplanes. The C planes are marked by extremely fine grained quartz, epidote, sericite, \nchlorite and biotite. \n\n3.3.2 - The basement-cover contact \n\nThe crystalline basement is overlain by the Itabaiana, Ribeir\u00f3polis, Palestina and \nOlhos D'\u00e1gua Formations (Fig. 3.1). The basement-cover contact is generally low-angle \ndipping around the Itabaiana dome (dipping away from the centre, in alt directions) and \nin the western Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, but dips at high-angles in the rest of the area. \n\n4 5 \n\n\n\nA : Homogeneous banding of \nthe Itabaiana gneiss consisting \nof quartz-feldspar dm-thick \nlayers and intercalated cm-thick \nmica layers. \nOutcrop 334, NW of \nS\u00e3o Domingos town. \n\nB : Undeformed unconformable \ncontact between highly foliated \ngneiss and basal Itabaiana \nconglomerates. \nOutcrop 365, Jacarecica river, \neastern Itabaiana dome. \n\n\n\nC : Quartz-feldspar-sericite-chlorite \npnyllonites of the western \nItabaiana dome, affected by \npervasive shear bands which \nindicate a top down to WNW \nmovement. \nOutcrop 323, SW of Macambira. \n\nD : Sheared Itabaiana quartzites \noverlying the phyllonites in C. \nA top down to WNW movement \nis also indicated by the fractured \npulled-apart feldspar, and \nrotated quartz grains.

Thin section \nparallel to the elongation lineation \nand perpendicular to the \nbedding-parallel foliation. \nSame locality as C. \n\nFigure 3.9 - The crystalline basement and the contact relationships. \n\n4 6 \n\n\n\nDespite discontinuous outcrops and the weathered appearance of the grasses in \nsome places, it can be seen that the basement and cover are generally sheared or \nmylonitic along the contact the basement-cover contact is mostly undeformed along the \neastern margin of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.9 B). and in parts of the western border, \nbetween the town of Macambira and the northern edge of the Miaba range (Fig. 3.1) \n\nIn the Macambira area, however, the Itabaiana quartzites occur in some places \n\ndirectly above basement-derived quartz-feldspar- sericite-chlorite phyllonites. Southwest \n\nof Macambira, where a secondary road cuts the basal contact and leaves the dome to the \n\nwest (Fig. 3.1, outcrop 323), the phyllonites dip 20\u00b0 to NNW and are affected by small-\n\nscale, asymmetric, WNW verging folds and by a pervasive and finely spaced se, of \n\nshear bands which dip 25\u00b0 to WNW (Fig. 3.9 C). \nThese structures indicate a top down to WNW extensional movement. In thin \n\nsection, the basal Itabaiana quartzites from this locality are also mylonitic. They contain \nelongated, pulled-apart and rotated feldspar grains, and elongated quartz grams, berth \nwith pressure shadow zones. The structures shown in the quartzites resemble \nimperfectly developed shear bands (Fig. 3.9 D) but also indicate a top down to the \nWNW movement. \n\nThe phyllonites can be traced southwards from outcrop 323 to outcrop 1217 in \nthe Cova stream (Fig. 3.1), where the phyllonitic foliation dips 55\u00b0 to W and the \n\nextensional shear bands dip 50\u00b0 to WNW. \nHumphrey &amp; Allard (1969) described that in the northern edge of the Miaba \n\nrange the phyllomtes trend to the SW and pass underneath the locally SE trending basal \nunconformity, between the Itabaiana quartzites and the gneisses. They also described \nNW trending meso-scale folds that have deformed the phyllonites, together with the \n\nshear bands and the Itabaiana quartzites. \nIn at least two other western localities the Itabaiana gneisses are also affected by \n\nlow-angle, WNW dipping local extensional faults (outcrop 554, ENE of Macambira) or \nextensional shear bands mostly affecting the mica-rich layers (outcrop 1215, Cova \nstream). A generally low-angle, WNW plunging mineral stretching lineation is also \npresent in these outcrops. All of the kinematic indicators observed in these outcrops \nindicate top down to WNW extensional movement. \n\n3.3.3 - The Miaba Group \nThe Miaba Group consists of the Itabaiana quartzites, the Ribeir\u00f3pohs pebbly \n\nphyllites, and the Jacoca carbonates. The thickness of this group varies from 200m. in \n\nthe western Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, to 1100m on the eastern and western sides of the \n\nItabaiana dome. \n\nThe Itabaiana Formation (P\u20ac I) \nThe Itabaiana Formation is 400-700m thick in the eastern and western borders of \n\nthe Itabaiana dome, 30-200m in the rest of the area, and is comprised of a sandy and a \n\nmuddy lithofacies (Fig. 3.10). \n\n47 \n\n\n\nA : Medium to fine grained, \nplanar-parallel cross bedded \nquartzites of the middle section \nof the Itabaiana Formation. \nOutcrop 963, Comprida range, \neastern Itabaiana dome. \n\nB : Conglomeratic quartzite of \nthe upper Itabaiana Formation. \nOutcrop 312, Capit\u00e3o Farm. \n\n\n\nC : The muddy lithofacies \nof the Itabaiana Formation, \nconsisting of m-thick, \nlaterally discontinuous layers \nof cross-bedded \nmetasandstones and wackes, \nintercalated with \nred-brown phyllites. \nOutcrop 227, western \nSim\u00e3o Dias dome. \n\nFigure 3.10 - The Itabaiana Formation (PC I). \n\n4 8 \n\n\n\nThe sandy lithofacies surrounds most of the Itabaiana dome, the western part of \nthe Sim\u00e3o Dias dome and is also found in the Volta range (in the NE corner of the area). \nIt consists of white to grey or yellow, fine to medium grained (0.15 - 0.50mm) \nfeldspathic quartzites, orthoquartzites and minor, decimetre to centimetre-thick siltstone \nbeds. Mappable slices of mylonitic Itabaiana quartzites occur within the Sim\u00e3o Dias \ngneiss (Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe muddy lithofacies occurs along the Redonda and Campina ranges to the \nnorth of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.1) and also in the western part of Sim\u00e3o Dias dome. \nIt consists of 1 m-thick layers of arkosic sandstones and arkosic quartzites interbedded \nwith 1m-thick layers of reddish brown mudstones and phyllites. \n\nThe most typical section (Fig. 3.8) starts with local bodies of 10m-thick matrix-\nsupported conglomerates and conglomeratic sandstones, with basement-derived clasts. \nThese pass gradually into 100's of metres of 10-30cm thick beds of white to grey, fine \nto medium-grained, small to meso-scale parallel cross-bedded feldspathic quartzites (Fig, \n3.10 A). \n\nAt the top, this fining upwards sequence consists of grey to reddish brown, fine-\ngrained metasandstones, metasiltites and meta-argillites, but l-10m-thick lenses of \nconglomerates (Fig. 3.10 B) or conglomeratic and cross-bedded sandstones may occur \ninstead, particularly to the eastern and western margins of the Itabaiana dome. \n\nThe basal feldspathic content ( 20%) diminishes up-section and most of the \nItabaiana Formation shows a remarkably homogeneous quartzitic composition (with less \nthan 5% of opaque minerals, zircon and tourmaline as accessories). Herring bone cross-\nstratification, convolute laminations and wavy laminations are also displayed. \n\nThe muddy lithofacies consists of muddy and micaceous quartzites and/or 10-\n100cm thick layers of parallel cross-bedded, arkosic metasandstones intercalated with \nred-brown phyllites (Fig. 3.10 C). \n\nThe correlation of the quartzites and muddy lithofacies which occur along the \nCampina, Redonda and Volta ranges (originally mapped as quartzitic lenses of the Frei \nPaulo-Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation, in Gava et al. 1983 and Santos et al. 1988) with the \ntypical Itabaiana quartzites is supported by (a): the gradual passage of the Itabaiana \nquartzites to the muddy lithofacies in road cuts in the Redonda and Machado ranges; and \n(b): the Volta thrust, in the northeastern corner of the area, which places muddy, \nmicaceous quartzites and unmappable slices of basement-derived mylonites over the Frei \nPaulo phyllites. \n\nThe Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation (P\u20ac R) \n\nThe Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation is proposed here as a formation to merge the \nJacarecica Formation and the Ribeir\u00f3polis facies of the Frei Paulo-Ribeir\u00f3polis \nFormation of the old stratigraphy (Figs. 2.3 &amp; 2.5 B). \n\nThis proposal is based on field evidence which shows a gradual passage from the \n\nquartzites and interbedded arkosic metasandstones and phyllites (Itabaiana Formation in \n\nthe northern part of this study area) to red-brown silty phyllites in the Machado and \n\nRedonda ranges (Fig. 3.1). These phyllites continue up to the northern end of the area, \n\n4 9 \n\n\n\nacross the Ribeir\u00f3polis town where, together with lenses of pebbly phyllites and \nintermediary and acid volcanic rocks, form the Ribeir\u00f3polis facies of the Frei Paulo-\nRibeir\u00f3polis Formation (Gava et al. 1983; Santos et al. 1988). This assemblage is very \nmuch similar to the assemblage mapped in gradual transition to the Itabaiana quartzites in \nthe western Sim\u00e3o Dias dome (Appendices A 1.2-A 1.3) and which Humphrey &amp; Allard \n(1967, 1969) mapped in the Jacarecica Formation. \n\nThe Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation consists of pebbly phyllites and local conglomerates \n(Figs. 3.11 A &amp; B), white, grey to red-brown silty phyllites (Fig. 3.11 C), \nmetagreywackes, argillites, quartz-sericite phyllites (Appendix A1.8) and generally \nweathered metavolcanic rocks with acid to intermediary composition. All these rocks \nwere previously in the Jacarecica Formation and in part of the Frei Paulo-Ribeir\u00f3polis \nFormation (Silva Filho et al. 1978 a &amp; b). \n\nThe Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation occurs in gradational contact with the Itabaiana \nFormation. In one locality (Flecheira farm, outcrop 471, Fig. 3.1) the contact is sheared \nalong a low-angle, WNW dipping ramp. The formation is 0-300rn thick around the \nbasement domes, but may attain 500m along the WNW-ESE trending belts to the north \nand south of the Itabaiana dome. A small body of pebbly phyllites is mappable between \nthe towns of Frei Paulo and Macambira (Fig. 3.1). \n\nDue to the great variety of lithofacies, this formation lacks a type-section, but \ngenerally the pebbly phyllites and conglomerates occupy basal positions and the phyllitic \nfacies occurs towards the top of the unit. \n\nIt is noticeable that in part of the western Sim\u00e3o Dias dome the Ribeir\u00f3polis \nFormation consists of highly foliated intermediate metavolcanics and blue to green colour \nphyllites (A 1.2), and that the conglomeratic lithofacies are more important in the eastern \nand western Itabaiana dome, where a thin and discontinuous layer of coarse sandy-\nsupported, well-cemented, brown, coarsening-up conglomerate is present (Fig. 3.6). \n\nA composite stratigraphic section through the Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation (Fig. 3.8) \nstarts with white to grey, or light brown, silty argillites with parallel stratification, \ncontaining l-10m-thick intercalations of fine- to medium-grained metagreywackes, \ngraded bedded 5mm-grained conglomeratic sandstones, and pebbly phyllites with 10-\n15cm size clasts of basement rocks, milky quartz and quartzites. \n\nThis sequence passes upwards into finely laminated grey meta-argillites and light \nbrown metasiltites which are overlain by light brown, calcareous phyllites with \nintercalations of carbonaceous phyllites. This succession indicates a gradual passage \nupward to the overlying Jacoca Formation. The basal third of this type section also \noccurs in the western Itabaiana dome where basal, white to grey, silty phyllites locally \ncontain 5cm size clasts of quartzites and basement rocks (Appendix Al .4). \n\nOn the northern side of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.7) the formation starts with \nred-brown to purple silty phyllites, and passes northward with intercalations of pebbly \nphyllites, light brown and purple phyllites, and possible porphyroclastic units \n(weathered metarhyolites and metadacites have been described as part of this sequence \nby Santos et al. 1988). At the southern margin of the dome, light brown silty phyllites \nwith thin intercalations of fine metagreywackes are found (Appendix A1.8). \n\n5 0 \n\n\n\nA : Light grey pebbly phyllites \nwith a silty matrix and clasts \nfrom basement rocks, quartzite \nand milky quartz. \nOutcrop 227, western \nSim\u00e3o Dias dome, \n\nB : Coarsening-upward \nmatrix-supported \nconglomerates with clasts \nfrom quartzite, milky quartz, \nand basement rocks.

Locally it is in direct contact with the Itabaiana quartzites \n(outcrop 312, Capit\u00e3o farm, Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe Jacoca Formation is comprised of two lithofacies: metacarbonates and a \nmixed lithofacies of metasiliciclastics and metacarbonates, or mixtites. The \nmetacarbonates occur as 100-300m thick mappable bodies around the eastern and \nwestern parts of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.1). The mixtites are absent or 100m thick in \nthe western part of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome and in a WNW-ESE trending band mapped to \nthe north of the Mocambo fault (Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe best exposures of the metacarbonates are in the steep walls along the Salgado \nand Vaza Barris rivers, in the Capit\u00e3o farm (outcrops 311-312, Fig. 3.1) where a vertical \nsuccession of sub-Iithofacies can be followed in deformed and relatively undeformed \nareas. \n\nThe typical section (Fig. 3.12) starts with a 3m thick layer of laminated white to \n\nlight grey, l-3cm thick beds of dolomites containing lcm thick beds of pyrite and \n\nchalcopyrite. These are overlain by a 15m thick layer of thinly laminated dolomites, \n\nlight brown metachert and calcitic, dark grey to black phyllites and 10m of massive \n\ndolomites. In thin section, the finely laminated dolomites display a typical marble texture \n\nof equigranular recrystallised calcite grains, interbedded with 1mm-thick micaceous \n\nlayers composed of sericite, chlorite, biotite, very fine grained quartz and feldspars. \n\nThese define a layer-parallel foliation. \n\nThis unit is overlain by a 40m thick sequence of intercalate, l-10cm thick \nlayers of grey limestones, calcarenites, and dark grey to black, locally carbonaceous \nphyllites. These units display parallel laminations and wave truncated current ripples \n(Fig. 3.13) and pass upwards into a 200m thick sequence of lm thick layers of light \ngrey metadolomites. \n\nDetailed studies in the lower and upper sections of this formation in the Capit\u00e3o \nfarm area have also revealed local lm-scale hummocky cross-stratifications (Castro \n1987) and abundant oolites and intraclasts (Guimar\u00e3es et al. 1991). \n\nIn the eastern part of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.8) the Jacoca Formation consists \nof thinly-laminated, light and dark grey, fine-grained limestones with local, 10cm-thick \nintercalations of black to dark grey metachert. In the headwaters of the Morcego stream \n(Appendix A 1.6), the formation consists of interbedded, l-10cm thick layers of dark \ngrey to black, fine-grained limestones interlayered with light brown metapelites. These \npass gradually, along the section, into the green-brown quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites \nof the overlying Frei Paulo Formation. \n\nThe mixtites consist of discontinuous, 10m thick lenses of light grey dolomites \nhosted within dominantly light brown phyllites in the western Sim\u00e3o Dias dome (Fig. \n3.5 &amp; Appendix A1.3). To the north of the Mocambo fault, they occur as a sequence of \n1m thick layers of dark grey to black and fine-grained limestones intercalated with light \nbrown to variegated phyllites. \n\n52 \n\n\n\nWall of the Vaza Barris river, in the Capit\u00e3o Farm, showing the best expression of \nthe Jacoca Formation, which starts with a basal dolomitic layer (1) deposited on \nthe Ftibeir\u00f3polis conglomerates (Re), overlain by thinly interbedded dolomites, \nmetachert and dark grey phyllites (2), overlain by m-thick, massive layers of \ndolomites {3, in the core of the fold) and by intercalated limestones and dark grey \nto black phyllites (4), covered by more massive limestones and dolomites (5). \n\nFigure 3.12-The Jacoca Formation (PC Ja). \n\n5 3 \n\n\n\nWave-reworked, parallel laminated doloarenites and \ndolosiltites of the middle section of the Jacoca Formation. \nThe truncated current ripples indicate a local westward \nsedimentary flow.

It is a 100-700m thick coarsening-up \n\nsiliciclastic sequence which conformably overlies the Miaba Group and is mappable in \n\nthe southern part of the studied area (Fig. 3.14), as well as in the core of the Paripiranga \n\nanticline (Appendix A1.2) and to the east of the Itabaiana dome (Fig, 3.8). \n\nThe Lagarto Group comprises three interfingering Formations: the Lagarto-\n\nPalmares sandstones, the Jacar\u00e9 metasiltites and the Frei Paulo phyllites. \n\nThe Lagarto-Palmares Formation comprises the Lagarto and Palmares \n\nFormations described by Silva Filho et al. (1978b) and Silva Filho (1982). It is based on \n\nfield observations for a gradual transition between these rocks in the Itabaiana Dome \n\nArea (Fig. 3.14 and Appendix A 1.2) which confirms the same relationship described in \n\na cratonic area, 100km to the south of Itabaiana (Saes 1984). \n\nThe interfingering of the Lagarto-Palmares sandstones with the Frei Paulo \n\nphyllites in the southern part of the study area, through a WNW-ESE trending band of \n\nmetasiltites, has required the definition of the Jacar\u00e9 Formation. \n\nThe Lagarto-Palmares Formation (P\u20ac LP) \n\nThe Lagarto-Palmares Formation is a coarsening-upward sequence of mudstones \nand siltites, fine sandstones and siltites, and medium, massive sandstones (Fig. 3.15). \nThese can be subdivided into a basal, an intermediate and an upper unit. \n\nAlthough these sediments are flat-lying everywhere in the southern part of the \narea, the maximum thickness of the formation is actually unknown as the upper unit \ncovers most of the lower units, and the upper surface is erosional. The thickness of \n\n200m adopted here for each of the lower two units is taken from descriptions by (Silva \nFilho 1978b), based on well data and measured sections outside the area of this study. \nThe preserved thickness of the third unit is estimated at 300m on the basis of \ntopographic relationships. \n\nThe Lagarto-Palmares Formation conformably overlies the Jacoca Formation but \nmay well be locally in contact with the Itabaiana and Ribeir\u00f3polis Formations, as \nsuggested in the western part of the S\u00edm\u00e3o Dias dome, in places where the Jacoca \nFormation is not directly observed (e.g. outcrops 289 to 285, Fig. 3.1, and Appendix \nA1.2). \n\nThe basal unit consists of mudstones and siltstones intercalated with 10-20cm \n\nthick lenses of generally 0.15mm grain size, cross bedded sandstones (Fig. 3.15 A), \n\nand is dominant along the southern border of the study area. The sandy layers are \n\nmarked by repeated cycles of 1 cm parallel lamination capped by generally symmetric \n\nand small-scale wave ripples, bounded by sharp truncation surfaces (Fig. 3.15 B). \n\nThe intermediate unit consists of fine-grained ( 0.15mm grain size), light brown \n\nto grey, l-10cm thick layers of laterally continuous micaceous sandstones interlayered \n\nwith 1mm-lcm thick layers of red-brown argillites and siltites. These are the typical \n\nLagarto sandstones, as described by Silva Filho et al. (1978b) and Silva Filho (1982). \n\nThey commonly display the cyclic sequences of micaceous sandstones and red-brown \n\n55 \n\n\n\n5 6 \n\n\n\nA : The lower unit consisting \nof interlayered siltstones and \nmudstones, and fine grained \nsandy bodies.

These features are also seen in \nthe outcrops 434, 435 in the Comandante farm, and outcrop 484 in the Limeira farm (S \nof the Itabaiana dome, Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe upper unit of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation starts with cm-thick layers of \nfine to medium grained, brown to grey, parallel-laminated micaceous sandstones, with \nabundant symmetric wave ripples and wave-ripple cross stratification (Fig. 3.15 C). \nThis passes, in a continuous road-cut exposure, into a sequence of metre-scale beds of \neither massive or parallel-laminated, green-grey, calcite-cemented micaceous sandstones \nand wackes (Fig. 3.15 D). Primary structures, such as sand-mud couplets, disrupted \nmuddy layers, sand dikes, and fluid-escape structures are found (Fig. 3.15 E-G), \ntogether with metre-scale parallel cross stratification indicative of a northward \nsedimentary input into the basin (Fig. 3.15 H). \n\nThe massive sandstones correspond to the Palmares Formation, as described by \nSilva Filho et ai. (1978b) and Silva Filho (1982). They contain l-10mm size discoid \nfragments of reworked, red-brown mudstones, and a typical bedding-fracture controlled \npattern of erosion that produces rounded boulders (Fig. 3.15 D). These boulders \ndominate the topography of the southern area and are particularly seen along the road \nItabaiana-Lagarto, and also in expressive outcrops mapped in the core of the Paripiranga \nanticline (Fig. 3.15 I K ) . \n\nPetrographic studies (Table 3.1) have shown that the sandstones of the Lagarto-\nPalmares Formation are submature sediments, composed by subangular to subrounded, \ngenerally 0,15-0.45mm size grains of quartz, k-feldspars, plagioclase, granite, opaque \nminerals, zircon, and aggregates of micro-crystalline quartz, calcite, epidote and flakes \nof muscovite. Some grains of micro-crystalline quartz suggest derivation from \nmylonites, and few clasts of extremely fine-grained material might be derived from \nphyllonites, phyllites, or even volcanic rocks. Flakes of biotite and chlorite are found \nkinked, but the chlorite also occurs in zones of diffuse boundaries, possibly formed by \nlow grade metamorphism. \n\nIn the cratonic area Saes (1984) described a mineral composition for the Palmares \nsandstones similar to that in Table 3.1, and interpreted the source areas as granite-gneiss \ncrystalline basement with belts of low grade metamorphic rocks. \n\nThe J a c a r \u00e9 Formation (PC Je) \n\nThis formation consists essentially of light brown, micaceous, 10-100cm thick \nlayers of metasiltites, or consists of light brown to variegated metasiltites (Fig. 3.16 A) \nwith subordinated, l-10m thick lensoid bodies of fine- to medium-grained, light brown \nmetasandstones. \n\nThe metasiltites are mappable along an E-W trending band in the southern area \nand in the core of the Paripiranga anticline (Fig. 3.1). The thickness is estimated as \n=150-200m (Fig. 3.14) but is probably less in the core of the Paripiranga anticline, \nwhere the outcrop width is smaller. \n\n6 0 \n\n\n\nMIDDLE-UPPER SECTION OF THE LAGARTO-PALMARES FORMATION \n\nO u t c r o p \n\nDR 1 5 5 \n\n% \n% Q , F , L \n\nDR 159 \n\n% \n% Q , F , L \n\nDR 2 8 4 \n\n% \n% Q, F, L \n\nDR 285 \n\n% \n% Q , F, L \n\nDR 434 \n\n% \n% Q, F, L \n\nDR 484 \n\n% \n% Q, F, L \n\nQ u a r i z + c h e r t + \n\nq u a r t z i t e \n\n1 7 2 \n\n2 8 . 6 \n\n4 6 . 1 \n\n1 6 7 \n\n2 7 . 8 \n\n4 2 . 2 \n\n2 4 7 \n\n4 1 . 1 \n\n6 7 . 7 \n\n2 7 4 \n\n4 5 . 4 \n\n6 8 . 2 \n\n1 5 4 \n\n2 5 . 6 \n\n4 3 . 2 \n\n1 1 9 \n\n1 9 . 8 \n\n4 0 . 2 \n\nFeldspars \n\n1 2 9 \n\n2 1 . 5 \n\n3 4 . 6 \n\n1 4 1 \n\n2 3 . 5 \n\n3 2 . 6 \n\n5 9 \n\n9 . 8 \n\n1 6 . 1 \n\n8 0 \n\n1 3 . 2 \n\n1 9 . 9 \n\n1 3 8 \n\n2 3 \n\n3 8 . 7 \n\n1 0 2 \n\n1 7 \n\n3 4 . 4 \n\nLithic \nf r a g m e n t s \n\n7 2 \n\n1 2 \n\n1 9 . 3 \n\n8 8 \n\n1 4 . 6 \n\n2 2 . 2 \n\n5 9 \n\n9.8 \n\n1 6 . 2 \n\n4 8 \n\n7 . 9 \n\n1 1 . 9 \n\n6 4 \n\n1 0 . 6 \n\n1 8 . 1 \n\n7 5 \n\n1 2 . 5 \n\n2 5 . 4 \n\nMicas \n\n2 2 \n\n3 . 6 \n-\n\n2 7 \n\n4 . 5 \n\n-\n1 3 \n\n2.1 \n\n-\n3 5 \n\n5.8 \n-\n\n3 2 \n\n5 . 3 \n\n-\n3 8 \n\n6 . 3 \n\n-\n\nCarbonate \n\n1 6 \n\n2 . 6 \n-\n1 \n\n0.1 \n-\n-\n. \n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n3 4 \n\n5 . 6 \n-\n\n1 3 \n\n2 . 1 \n\n-\n\nO t h e r \n\n8 8 \n\n1 4 . 6 \n_ \n\n6 5 \n\n1 0 , 8 \n-\n\n1 0 9 \n\n1 8 . 1 \n-\n\n4 1 \n\n6 . 7 \n. \n\n4 7 \n\n7 , 8 \n. \n\n7 8 \n\n1 3 \n\n-\n\nMatrix \n\n( c e m e n t ) \n\n1 0 1 \n\n1 6 . 8 \n-\n\n1 1 1 \n\n1 8 . 5 \n. \n\n1 1 3 \n\n1 8 . 8 \n-\n\n1 2 5 \n\n2 0 . 7 \n_ \n\n1 3 1 \n\n2 1 . 8 \n-\n\n1 7 5 \n\n2 9 . 1 \n-\n\nFREI PAULO METASANDSTONES OF THE NORTHERN PART OF THE AREA \n\nO u t c r o p \n\nDR 2 1 2 \n\n% \n% Q , F, L \n\nDR 1 1 6 7 \n\n% \n\n% Q, F, L \n\nDR 1 1 7 1 \n\n% \n% Q, F, L \nDR 1 1 7 3 \n\n% \n% Q, F, L \n\nQ u a r t z + c h e r t + \n\nq u a r t z i t e \n\n1 8 1 \n\n3 0 . 1 \n\n4 5 , 6 \n\n1 0 6 \n\n1 7 . 6 \n\n4 3 . 1 \n\n2 3 0 \n\n3 8 , 3 \n\n5 9 . 9 \n\n7 1 \n\n1 1 . 8 \n\n5 7 . 7 \n\nFeldspars \n\n1 3 0 \n\n2 1 . 6 \n\n3 2 . 7 \n\n1 0 3 \n\n1 7 . 1 \n\n4 1 . 8 \n\n9 2 \n\n1 5 . 3 \n2 4 \n\n4 0 \n\n6 . 6 \n\n3 2 . 5 \n\nLithic \n\nf r a g m e n t s \n\n8 6 \n\n1 4 . 3 \n\n2 1 . 7 \n\n3 7 \n\n6,1 \n\n1 5 \n\n6 2 \n\n1 0 . 3 \n\n1 6 . 1 \n\n1 2 \n\n2 \n\n9.8 \n\nMicas \n\n3 8 \n\n6.3 \n-\n\n6 0 \n\n1 0 \n\n-\n4 6 \n\n7 . 6 \n-\n\n3 6 \n\n6 \n\n-\n\nCarbonate \n\n1 9 \n\n3 . 1 \n-\n\n8 0 \n\n1 3 . 3 \n. \n3 \n\n0 . 5 \n-\n\n2 2 6 \n\n3 7 . 6 \n\n-\n\nO t h e r \n\n1 1 \n\n1.8 \n-\n\n5 8 \n\n9 . 6 \n. \n\n3 6 \n\n6 \n-\n\n3 9 \n\n6 . 5 \n-\n\nMatrix \n( c e m e n t ) \n\n1 3 6 \n\n2 2 . 6 \n_ \n\n1 5 6 \n\n2 6 \n_ \n\n1 3 1 \n\n2 1 . 8 \n-\n\n2 2 6 \n\n3 7 . 6 \n-\n\nTable 3.1 Petrography of the sandstones of the Lagarto group. \n\nIn samples DR-155, 159, 284, 285, 434 and 485, the matrix and the cement include \nmostly very fine-grained quartz, sericite, carbonate and iron (?) oxide. Grain size is \n0,15-0.45mm and the grains are generally subangular to subrounded, with low to high \nsphericity, in samples DR-212, 1167, 1171 and 1173 (deformed calcareous metasandstonea \nof the Frei Paulo formation in the northern part of the area), the matrix and cement \ninclude mostly carbonate, very fine quartz, sericite and iron {?} oxide. \nIn all the samples, micas are flakes of muscoviie, biotite and chlorite (some are kinked). \nOther minerals include mostly opaque grains, some zircon and epidote. \nLithic fragments are mostly from very fine-grained quartz aggregates (mylonites), \ngneisses or granites, metachert, and grains entirely consisting of very fine-grained \nsericite and quartz (possibly from phyllites or metavoicanics). \n% Q,F,L, means normalized percentage to Q=quartz+quartzite+chert, \nF=feldspars+plagioclase, and L=lithic fragments.' \n\n6: \n\n\n\nIn the vicinity of faults and shear zones, these rocks attain a dark brown to black \n\ncolour, are silicified and indurated, and show a vitreous texture, as observed in outcrops \n\n437, 438 and 485 within the Comandante and Limeira farms (Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe Frei Paulo Formation (P\u20ac FP, FP1, FP3) \nThe Frei Paulo Formation is widespread (Fig. 3.1): it occurs along a WNW-ESE \n\nband in contact with the Jacar\u00e9 Formation, in the southern part of the study area, and \n\nalso in a WNW-ESE trending band passing around the Frei Paulo town. It is also \n\nmapped around the basement domes, as well as in the Vaza Barris river valley (between \n\nthe Escarpa and Pelada faults), and to the west of the Paripiranga town. The thickness is \n\nestimated between = 100m (in the western part of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome) and 300m to \n\n>500m elsewhere, particularly in the Vaza Barris valley area. \n\nThis formation comprises rocks of the original Frei Paulo and Capit\u00e3o \n\nFormations, as defined by Humphrey &amp; Allard (1967,1969), and rocks of the Frei \n\nPaulo-Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation, as defined by Silva Filho et ai. (1978b). It also \n\nincorporates new areas where the typical Frei Paulo phyllites were mapped during the \n\ncourse of this research, such as those narrow bands to the north of the Escarpa and \n\nMocambo faults, and to the south of the Pelada fault (Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe Frei Paulo Formation is comprised of three main lithofacies respectively \ntermed PG FP, FP1 and FP3 (Fig. 3.1, enclosure). The lithofacies P\u20ac FP consists of 1-\n10mm thick beds of light grey to brown, silty and variegated phyllites, which are the \ntypical Frei Paulo phyllites (Fig. 3.16 B). \n\nThe lithofacies FP1 consists of trappable bodies of arkosic metasandstones and \nwackes. It also consists of light brown phyllites with -10-100cm thick interbedded \nlayers of fine- to medium-grained metasandstones (e.g. outcrops 846, 848-850, to the \nwest of Paripiranga, Fig. 3.1) or even tens of metres thick bodies of metasandstones and \nquartzites (e.g. outcrops 353, 354, and 356, to the west of Macambira). \n\nThe lithofacies FP3 comprises quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites and intercalated \nfine- to medium-grained metagreywackes (Fig. 3.16 C), light brown phyllites associated \nwith thinly interbedded dark grey to black phyllites, metasiltites, calcilutites (or \nmetarhytmites, Fig. 3.16 D) and interbedded limestones and metagrey wackes (Fig. \n3.17). \n\nThe variegated phyllites are a key horizon as they are found overlying the Jacoca \n\ncarbonates, to the east and west of the Itabaiana dome, and underlying the Palestina \n\ndiamictites to the west of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome (Fig. 3.1). Their lateral and vertical \n\njuxtaposition with the other lithofacies is observed in the stratigraphic sections across the \n\neastern and western parts of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.6 &amp; Appendices A1.4-A1.6), \n\nand also between the Jacarecica river section (Fig. 3.8) and the variegated silty phyllites \n\nthat occur along the Areia Branca-Saco Torto road (outcrops 371, 372, Fig. 3.1). \n\nEach lithofacies of the Frei Paulo Formation is dominant, but not exclusive, in a \n\nparticular area geographically related to the regional faults. The variegated silty phyllites \n\nare most important to the south of the Escaipa fault, whereas between the Escarpa and \n\nPelada faults, and in the eastern side of the Itabaiana dome, the main lithofacies are the \n\n62 \n\n\n\n- \u2022 v i \\ 1 \n\nA : Light brown, fine sandy \nand well laminated \nJacar\u00e9 metasiltites. \nOutcrop 489, road Lagarto \nto Itabaiana. \n\nB : Typical variegated Frei Paulo \nphyllites (P\u20ac PF) consisting of \nintercalated, pale and dark grey \nphyllitic layers, with subordinated \nthin silty and sandy layers. \nOutcrop 490, road Lagarto to \nItabaiana.

The petrography of these sandstones is similar to the Lagarto-Palmares \n\nsandstones and wackes, but the carbonate content is greater (Table 3.1). \n\nThe very narrow band of the Frei Paulo Formation, which lies just to the north of \n\nthe Mocambo fault (Fig. 3.1), consists of light-grey to brown silty phyllites to the NE of \n\nPinh\u00e3o (outcrops 275 and 816), to the NNW of Macambira, towards to Frei Paulo \n\n(outcrops 541 and 1009) and in the northwestern comer of the area (outcrop 1086). It \n\nalso consists of brown silty phyllites and fine-grained, calcite-cemented metasandstones \n\nwith l-10cm thick lenses of black and very fine-grained limestones (outcrops 1165 and \n\n1166) which occur along the Mocambo fault zone. In this area, the Mocambo fault is \n\nhundreds of metres wide and controls the local E-W trend of the Salgado river and a \n\nsmall tributary to the west. \n\nThe metasandstones are more weathering-resistant and are breeciated in some \n\nscattered places along the fault, but a microscopic study of fresher samples has revealed \n\nthe same petrography of the fine to medium grained, micaceous, calcite-cemented \n\nmetasandstones mapped within the Frei Paulo Formation along the track from the \n\nSalgado to Riach\u00e3o and Rosa Am\u00e9lia farms (outcrops 1167 to 1173, southeast of \n\nMocambo). These sandstones are also observed within the Frei Paulo phyllites, to the \n\nwest of the Paripiranga town (outcrop 848) and lm-thick intercalations of \n\nmetasandstones and metagreywackes occur just to the north of the Comandante farm, \n\nwhere approaching the Escarpa fault and entering into the Vaza Barris river valley \n\n(outcrops 441-443, Fig. 3.1). \n\nParallel lamination is the most typical sedimentary structure observed in the Frei \n\nPaulo Formation, though small-scale wave-ripples and parallel cross stratification are \n\nfound locally (outcrop 7 1 , S of Sim\u00e3o Dias). \n\n3.3.5 - T h e Vaza B a r r i s G r o u p \n\nThe Vaza Barris Group is a 2000m-thick sequence unconformably overlying the \nprevious formations and the crystalline basement, and comprising the Palestina \ndiamictites and the Olhos D\u00e1gua metacarbonates. The group does not include the \nCapit\u00e3o Formation of Humphrey &amp; Allard (1967, 1969) and the Frei Paulo-Ribeir\u00f3polis \nFormation defined by Silva Filho et al. (1978 a,b) and redefined by Santos et al. \n(1988). \n\nThe Palestina F o r m a t i o n (P\u20ac P) \n\nThis formation consists of diamictites, pebbly phyllites and minor phyllites, and \n\ncontains local, generally 10m thick lenses of quartzites. It corresponds to the original \n\nPalestina Formation as defined by Humphrey &amp; Allard (1967, 1969). \n\n6 4 \n\n\n\nA : Intercalations of dark grey, \nfine grained limestones \n(arrowed) in the blue-grey \npebbly phyllites (see detail in B). \nOutcrop 405, Vaza Barris river \nvalley. \n\nB : Detail of A to show the \n1 -2cm size clast of basement \ngranitic rock in the pebbly phyllites \n(near the head of the pen). \n\nFigure 3.17 - Interlayered limestones and metagreywackes \nof the Frei Paulo Formation {fades PC FP3), \n\n6 5 \n\n\n\nThe diamictites and pebbly phyllites consist of generally flatenned and elongated \ngranules, pebbles and cobbles of basement rocks with less clasts from quartzites, \nphyllites, and metacarbonates. They are supported in a green- to blue-grey, extremely \nfine and foliated sericitic-chloritic matrix (Fig. 3.18). \n\nThe variations in thicknesses and lithological characteristics of this formation is \nevident from the outcrops in the Vaza Barris river valley, those in the Jacarecica river, \nand those around the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome (Fig. 3.1). A thin body of highly deformed \npebbly phyllites occur within mylonitic gneisses in a l00 m-scale outcrop nearby the \nvillage of Olhos D'\u00e1gua (outcrop 395, Fig. 3.1). \n\nIn the area confined between the Escarpa and Pelada faults, the diamictites are \nmuch more significant than elsewhere, and die thickness is roughly estimated to be \n\n500m. Clasts greater than 10cm are common and the matrix is generally more phyllitic \nthan elsewhere (Fig. 3.18 A). Lenses of dark brown to black, medium to coarse-grained \nquartzites occur locally. \n\nIn the Jacarecica river, the diamictites are found only in a narrow body which is \nfolded within the quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites and metasandstones of the Frei Paulo \nFormation. They contain irregular boulders and pebbles of Itabaiana quartzites and \nLagarto-Palmares metasandstones (Fig. 3.18 B), which have not been found in the rest \nof the area, nor reported in the literature. \n\nAround the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome the thickness of the Palestina Formation is \nprobably 100m. The matrix is siltier than elsewhere and the clasts are generally smaller \nthan 10cm (Fig. 3.18 C), although an isolated metre-scale block of granitic rock has \nbeen found near the trace of the Sim\u00e3o Dias fault (outcrop 90, very close to the SE of \nParipiranga, Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe Olhos D'a\u00e1gua Formation (P\u20ac OA) \nThe Olhos D'\u00e1gua Formation is 200-1300m thick and consists of \n\nmetacarbonates that conformably overlie the Palestina diamictites (Fig. 3.1). It can be \ndescribed in terms of three different lithofacies (Fig. 3.19): laminated carbonate \nrhythmites, oolitic limestones and dolostones, and mixed carbonate and siliciclastics \n(mixtites). \n\nThe best exposures are along the section from Paripiranga to the north (Fig. 3.5). \nThe section starts with hundreds of metres of laminated metacarbonate rhythmites, \nwhich consist of l-10cm thick and interbedded layers of light and dark grey to black, \nfine-grained limestones, with local l-3cm thick intercalations of light brown metasiltites \n(Fig. 3.19 A), brown to purple metapelites and chert. Small to medium-scale cross \nstratification are found locally. \n\nThese rocks pass up section into a sequence (probably also 100's of metres thick) \nmetalimestones and metadolostones consisting of interbedded, l-10cm thick layers of \nfine-grained, black limestones, in many places oolitic, pelloidal andoncolitic (Fig. 3.19 \nB).This lithofacies also contains l-10mm thick intercalations of brown metapelites, and \n10-100m thick layers of grey to light-brown doloarenites which display small-scale \nparallel cross stratification, wave scours, intraclasts and graded bedding (Fig. 3.19 C). \n\n66 \n\n\n\nA: Green-grey Palestina \ndiamictite with elongated \nciasts of granite and gneiss \nin a phyllitic matrix. \nOutcrop 405, Vaza Barris \nriver valley, road from the \nOlho D'\u00e1gua village to the \nBarrac\u00e3o Farm. \n\nB : Boulders of Itabaiana \nquartzites and \nLagarto-Palmares \nmetasandstones within the \nQuartz-sericite-chlorite phyllitic \nmatrix of the Palestina \ndiamictites.

This can be observed along the road Sim\u00e3o Dias to Pinh\u00e3o and \nalong the Salgado river, to the northwest of Macambira, going from the Jacoquinha farm \nto the Mocambo fault (Fig. 3.1) where there are several 10-100cm thick intercalations of \ndark grey to black phyllites (outcrops 1160-1164). \n\nThe Olhos D'\u00e1gua Formation also occurs in the Capit\u00e3o range, in the NW corner \nof the area, and in two separate bodies cut by the Propria fault, to the east of the \nItabaiana dome (Fig. 3.1), where the laminated meiacarbonate rhythmites dominate and \nappear to show a gradual passage from the green-grey Frei Paulo phyllites (see \nAppendix A1.6). \n\n3.4 - Lithofacies and depositional environments \n\n3.4.1 - Lithofacies distribution and paleogeography \n\nStra\u00fcgraphically, the sedimentary record of the Itabaiana Dome Area can be \nsummarised in terms of two siliciclastic and two carbonate megasequences. The \nsiliciclastics megasequences start respectively with the Itabaiana Formation and the \nLagarto Group, the upper part of each being completed with conglomeratic/volcanic \nfacies (the Ribeir\u00f3polis and Palestina Formations). The carbonate megasequences \ncomprise respectively the lithofacies of the Jacoca and Olhos D'\u00e1gua Formations. \n\nFigure 3.20 A shows the facies distribution throughout the area. Figure 3.20 B \nattempts to show a block diagram constructed with interpretative cross sections in the \nbasin (AA' to DD'). It is evident from Figure 3.20 A that the sedimentary record shows \na wide distribution of facies (and thickness) associated with the basement domes and the \nPelada, Escarpa, Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itaporanga faults (which are projected vertically down \ninto the cross-sections of Fig. 3.20 B). \n\nIf such variations are an indicator of sedimentary sources at different distances \nfrom the depocenters, as generally found in shallow water environments (Fairchild \n1989), some aspects of the evolution of the sedimentation in the Itabaiana Dome Area \ndeserve particular attention. This may be considered in terms of particular times of \nsedimentation (Fig. 3.20): Tl = Itabaiana time, T2 = Ribeir\u00f3polis-Jacoca time, T3 = \nLagarto Group time, T4 = Palestina time and T5 = Olhos D'\u00e1gua time. \n\nOverleaf: Legend for Figure 3.20. \n\n6 9 \n\n\n\n7\n0\n \n\n\n\nFigure 3.20 - (A): Map or HthofacFes and Irtt&amp;rpreiaiive \npaleoenvifcnments in the itabalana dome area (see legsnd). \n(B): Block diagram simulating the undeiormgd itabaiana dome \narea, constructed with the cross-seclions AA'-DD1 as \ninditatSif In (A).

The geological map of the \nItabaiana dome (Fig. 3.1, enclosure) shows the section lines of the main structural cross \nsections (AB, CD, E F ) presented in Figure 4.20 (enclosure). The localities and outcrop \nnumbers are found on the geological map of Figure 3.1. \n\nHereafter, where mentioned the X, Y and Z axis, and the XZ, XY and YZ \nplanes, the author is referring respectively to the orthogonal axis and planes of the D2 \n(second deformational event) finite strain ellipsoid, deduced for each outcrop on the \nbasis of the available macro and microscopic structural relationships. \n\n4.2 - The structures of the Itabaiana Dome Area - Introduction \nFigure 4.1 is a summary lithostructural map of the Itabaiana Dome Area. The \n\nmain structures are F1 and F2 folds, with their associated foliations and lineations, and a \nset of WNW-ESE striking high-angle thrust and sinistral strike-slip regional faults. \n\nThe F1 folds are inferred structures which occur to the west and north of the \nSim\u00e3o Dias dome, respectively within the Frei Paulo Olhos D'\u00e1gua and Jacoca \nFormations (Fig. 4.1). The F2 folds are mostly the Paripiranga anticline (to the west of \nthe Sim\u00e3o Dias dome), some overturned sync lines and anticlines which occur to the \nnorth, northwest and west of the Itabaiana dome, and the open folds which affect the \nMiaba range, in the western side of this dome (Fig. 4.1). \n\nThe regional faults are the Itaporanga, Sim\u00e3o Dias, Escarpa, Pelada, Mocambo, \nRibeir\u00f3polis and Dores faults. The main strike-slip faults are the dextral strike-slip Vaza \nBarris fault and the Mocambo dextral shear. Other NW-SE trend strike-slip faults cut \nacross the Itabaiana quartzites and also affect the basement, in the eastern and southern \nmargins of the Itabaiana dome. \n\nThe Itabaiana Dome Area is comprised of a domain of cratonic, non deformed \nand non metamorphosed sediments, and a domain of highly deformed, green schist facies \nmetasediments and minor metavolcanics mantling the Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias gneissic \ndomes. \n\nThe cratonic domain lies on the southwestern corner of the area and is separated \n\nfrom the deformed and metamorphosed domain by the Itaporanga fault (Fig. 4.1). The \n\n81 \n\n\n\n8\n2\n\n \n\n\n\ndeformed metasedimentary wedge occupies the rest of the area, but is separated by die \nSSW-NNE striking Propri\u00e1 fault from the Mesozoic Sergipe-Alagoas basin, in the \nsoutheastern part of the area. \n\nAs will be described along this chapter, the structures of the Itabaiana dome \nrecord three ductile to ductile-brittle deformational events ( D J - D - J ) characterised by \nfolds, faults and shear zones and accompanied by a sub-greenschist to greenschist \nmetamorphism. \n\nThese events affected the bedding of the metasediments (S0) and the \nmetamorphic banding of crystalline basement (Sn), and developed a varied set of planar \nfeatures (axial plane foliations and fold axial planes) and linear features (fold axis, \nintersection and elongation lineations). The folds, planar and linear features belonging to \neach D 1-D3 deformational event are respectively termed F j - F 3 , S1-S3; and Lj-L3 and are \ndefined in detail in Table 4.1. \n\n4.2.1 - Basement structures \nThe basement certainly underwent earlier deformations, as 10-100cm size \n\nisoclinal, rootless folds are intrafolial to the metamorphic banding in highly foliated \ngneisses cut by the undeformed basal unconformity (e.g. Fig. 3.9 B). Nevertheless, the \nscarcity of such evidence precludes the establishment of the earlier evolution of the \ncrystalline basement, before the deformation events which are the focus of this thesis. \n\nMore than that, the basement also shows evidence of being affected by three \nfolding events, which correspond to the structures affecting the metasedimentary cover, \nas will be demonstrated in this chapter. \n\nFor simplicity, terms such as Sn - 1, F n + 1 , etc, to describe the structures in the \nbasement will be avoided, and the metamorphic banding of the gneisses and \northogneisses (Sn) is simply considered the planar feature to be affected by the D 1 D 3 \ndeformational evolution (Table 4.1). \n\n4.2.2 - Summary of the deformational events and structural \ndomains \n\nThe D1 deformation affects So and Sn and is represented by recumbent folds \n(F1), associated with the axial planar foliation (S1), and with an intersection lineation \nL1-0) the D2 deformation is characterised by nearly upright folds (F2), which co-\naxially refold F, folds and S1,. Planar structures associated with F2 folds are the axial \nplane (PA2) and an axial planar foliation (S2). The linear features, generically termed L2, \nare the fold axis (B 2), the intersection lineation L1-2 and an stretching lineation (Ls,). D2 \nis also responsible for the high-angle thrust faults observed in the area (Fig. 4.1). \n\nThe D3 deformation is indicated by transversal, commonly upright folds (F3), \nwhich affect S2 (and the older planar structures). The associated planar elements are the \naxial plane (PA3) and the axial plane foliation (S3), whereas the linear elements are the \nfold axis (B3) and an intersection lineation (L3_2). \n\nThe relative chronology between the deformational events has been distinguished \non the basis of many examples of refolded folds, folded foliations, combined with cross-\n\n83 \n\n\n\nPlanar elements prior to D1 deformation \n\nS0 = bedding in the sediments and metasediments. \n\nSn = metamorphic banding in gneisses and orthogneisses of the \n\ncrystalline basement. \n\nFirst deformational event (D1) \n\nF1 = folds affecting So and Sn and being re-fo!ded by folds of the \n\nsecond deformational event. \nPA1 = axial plane of the F1 folds. \n\nS1 = axial planar foliation associated with F1 folds. \n\nB1 = F1 fold axis. \n\nL1-0= intersection lineation defined by the intersection of S1 with S0 \norS n . \n\nSecond deformational event (D2) \nF2 = folds co-axially folding F1 folds or S1. \n\nPA2 = axial plane of the F2 folds. \n\n52 = axial planar foliation associated with the F2 folds or a \n\nfoliation generally trending WNW-ESE or NNW-SSE, and cross \ncutting S1. \n\nB2 = F2 fold axis. \n\nL1-2= intersection lineation defined by the intersection of S1 and S2. \n\nLs = elongation lineation defined in the metasediments, basement \nrocks and fault-related rocks, by elongated minerals, clasts, \nporphyroclasts, oolites, pellets, and other strain markers. \n\nL2 = generic name for the linear features related to this event. \n\nThird deformational event (D3) \n\nF3 = NE trending folds and crenulations affecting S2 (and the older \n\nplanar features) or folding F1 and/or F2 folds. \n\nPA3 = axial plane of the F3 folds. \n\n53 = axial planar foliation associated with the F3 folds or a fracture \ncleavage foliation generally trending NE-SW or NNE-SSW, and \ncross cutting S2 (and the older planar features). \n\nB3 = F3fold axis. \n\nL3-2= intersection lineation defined by the intersection of S3 and S2. \n\nL3 = generic name for the linear features related to this event. \n\nTable 4.1 - Main structural features of the Itabaiana Dome Area. \n\n8 4 \n\n\n\ncutting relationships of foliations. Refolded folds are considered the best evidence \n\namongst other available criteria for regional correlations of structures in polydeformed \n\nareas (Williams 1985). \n\nThe superposition of D1 and D2 deformation events on rocks which have \n\ndifferent mechanical behaviours, developed an accentuated structural partitioning and a \nstrong anysotropy with a regional WNW-ESE trend in the study area (Fig. 4.1). \n\nAs a consequence, six structural domains have been defined in the Itabaiana \n\nDome Area, on the basis of different styles of the F2 folds, the relative attitude of Sl and \n\nS2, and also using the nature of the S2 foliation together with variations in the trends of \n\nS 2 and L2 (Fig. 4.2). \n\nThe sediments and the crystalline basement are divided into the cratonic, Sim\u00e3o \n\nDias and Itabaiana domains. The deformed metasediments are divided into the regional, \n\nwest and east domains (Fig. 4.2). \n\nThe cratonic domain, comprises mostly the flat-lying Lagarto-Palmares \n\nFormation, but also encompasses deformed Jacar\u00e9 metasiltites and Frei Paulo phylHtes. \n\nThe Sim\u00e3o Dias domain consists of the Sim\u00e3o Dias gneisses which are affected by tight \n\nF2 folds, and by a WNW-ESE trending S2 foliation. \n\nThe Itabaiana domain comprises the Itabaiana gneisses, which are affected by \n\nopen-tight F2 folds associated with a normally S2 spaced cleavage. This domain shows a \n\nvaried style of internal deformation according with the position in the Itabaiana dome \n\n(which is likely associated with the variable thickness of the Itabaiana quartzites). \n\nThe regional domain comprises the metasediments outside of the Itabaiana dome, \n\nand is characterised by sub-parallel and steep dipping S1 and S2 foliations, by tight F2 \nfolds, and by a WNW-ESE trend for S2 and L 2 . The west and east domains are on the \n\nwestern and eastern borders of the Itabaiana quartzites surrounding the Itabaiana dome \n\n(Fig. 4.2). Both characteristically present a flat-lying S1 foliation affected by open to \n\ntight F2 folds associated with NNW-SSE trending S2 and L2. \n\nThe stereographic plots of the D 1 -D 2 structures for each structural domain are \n\nshown in Figure 4.3 . \n\n4.3 - The D1 Deformation \nThe F1 f o l d s are generally WNW-ESE trending, SSW verging, isoclinal and \n\nrecumbent folds that affect S0 and Sn, and develop a strong axial planar foliation (S1) \n\nwhich cuts across the fold hinges (Figs. 4.4 A &amp; B). These folds are generally rootless \n\nand commonly range from 10's of centimetres to 10's of metres, and may have their \n\noverturned limbs cut by subhorizontal thrusts (Fig. 4.4 C). \n\nS1 mostly trends WNW-ESE and commonly dips at high angles (90\u00b0-60\u00b0 \n\ngenerally to the NNE, but also to the SSW) in the regional and Sim\u00e3o Dias domains, or \n\nat 60\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 in the Itabaiana domain. S1 is relatively flat-lying in the west and east \n\ndomains (Fig. 4.3 A), where the range of attitudes is from 20\u00b0/318\u00b0 to 60\u00b0/033\u00b0(west \n\ndomain) and from 30\u00b0/046\u00b0 to 15\u00b0/130\u00b0 (east domain). \n\n8 5 \n\n\n\n86 \n\n\n\nFigure 4.3 - Lower hemisphere stereographic plot of the D1 and D2 structural \nelements for each structural domain in the Itabaiana dome area.

The statistical analysis of the poles to S 0 , Sn and S1 (Fig. 4.3 A) shows more \n\nor less complete II girdles defining great circles, but the maximum concentration of \n\npoles observed in the regional, Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itabaiana domains indicates a 44\u00b0-70\u00b0 \n\ndip to NNE. This attitude is as a consequence of the vergence of the F2 folding \n\n(discussed in section 4.4 below). \n\nS1 is a foliation defined by a planar-parallel orientation of sericite (or muscovite), \nchlorite, locally biotite (Fig. 4.4 D) and very fine grained quartz, in phyllites, diamictites \nand metacarbonates, with addition of feldspars and epidote (transformed from \nhornblende) and trails of opaque minerals in the basement rocks. In the quartzites it \nmostly consists of sericite (or muscovite) and elongated quartz grains. \n\nQuartz and carbonate veins are injected sub-parallel to S, and are deformed by \nF2 folds. Syn-Dj quartz veins are common in the basement gneisses and in the phyllitic \nmetasediments, whereas carbonate veins are common in the metacarbonate formations. \n\nThe quartz-sericite-chlorite Frei Paulo phyllites, which are the dominant rock \ntype in the west and east domains, have a pervasive layer-parallel fabric defined by sub-\nmillimetre layers of micro-crystalline quartz intercalated with&lt;lmm-thick mica domains \n(sericite, chlorite and local biotite), and sub-parallel quartz veins, generally affected by \nthe D2 structures (Fig. 4.4 E). \n\nA strong S1 foliation consisting of oriented flakes of sericite and opaque minerals \nis observed sub-parallel to the bedding of Frei Paulo sandy phyllites in the western part \nof the area (outcrops 848, 849, Fig. 3.1). \n\nL1 linear features are the fold axes (B1) and the intersection lineation (L1-0), \nwhich may be marked by oriented flakes of micaceous minerals, quartz ribbons, or \nquartz and feldspars. The amount of field information on D 1 linear structures collected in \nthe area is insignificant for purposes of statistical analysis, but where these elements \nwere observed (e.g. outcrops 31, 305, 311, 720, 1040, 1112, Fig. 3.1) they are nearly \nparallel to L2 linear features. \n\n4.4 - The D2 Deformation \n\n4.4.1- F3 folds and structural elements \n\nF2 f o l d s are open to isoclinal, gently inclined to upright, WNW-ESE trending, \nasymmetric with a SSW vergence. They are gently plunging folds that affect SI, So and \nSn (Fig- 4.5). They co-axially refold the F1 folds, and range in size from micro \ncrenulations to km-scale folds (observed in the aerial photographs) and are generally \nassociated with a penetrative axial planar foliation (S2). \n\nThe S2 foliation is mainly a pressure solution or a mineral foliation, and less \n\ncommonly a slaty cleavage or a spaced cleavage. It generally dips at 60\u00b0-90\u00b0 to NNE in \n\nthe regional, Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itabaiana domains, and to NE in the west and east domains \n(Fig. 4.2 B). \n\n8 9 \n\n\n\nD - Layer-parallel S1 foliation \ndefined by&lt;1 mm layer of sericite, \nchlorite, minor biotite, quartz and \nfeldspar, in a specimen of \ndolomites of the Jacoca \nFormation.

Outcrop 266, road \nfrom Mocambo to Carira. \n\nFigure 4.5 - D2 folds in the metasediments (A) and in the gneissic basement (B) \nof the Itabaiana dome area. \n\n\n\nThe pressure solution foliation is normally defined by iron and/or manganese \n\noxide seams along sub-parallel surfaces and are best developed in tightly folded \n\nmetacarbonates (Fig. 4.6 A), and in the phyllitic rocks. In some cases the pressure \n\nsolution process appears to have evolved progressively from the development of \n\ncrenulations (as in Fig. 4.4 E), resulting in sharp zones of concentration of iron oxides \n\nand very fine micaceous minerals, comparable to the discrete crenulation cleavage of \n\nGray (1977). \n\nThe mineral foliation is commonly marked by parallel, fine-grained sericite, \n\nchlorite and some biotite, which in the diamictites and gneisses are accompanied by very \n\nfine-grained quartz and feldspars. The slaty cleavage is more common in phyllitic rocks \n\nand interbedded phylliies and metasiltites (Fig. 4.6 B). \n\nL2 linear features are also penetrative and consist of the fold axis (B2), the \n\nintersection lineation (L1-2) and the elongation lineation (Ls) ,which are all parallel to \n\neach other and plunge, generally at low angles (08\u00b0 to 16\u00b0) either to WNW or ESE, in \n\nthe regional, Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itabaiana domains, and either to NNW or SSE in the west \n\nand east domains (Fig. 4.2 C). The double plunge of L2 can be observed in the walls of \n\nlarge outcrops (e.g. outcrop 90, to the SE of Paripiranga, Figure 3.1). The shift of the \n\ndirections of L2 in the west and east domains, relative to the regional domain, confirms \n\nthe change of the strike of S2 (compare Figs. 4.3 B &amp; C). \n\nL1-2 is defined by the intersection of finely-spaced, mica-rich S2 planes with S1 \nor S0, Sn (Fig. 4.7 A), or by a pencil-like lineation (Fig. 4.8 B). Mullion structures \n\nmay locally occur in tightly folded metacarbonates. Ls is defined by flattened and \n\nelongated oolites and pellets in metacarbonates, by pyrite and fine-grained quartz in \n\nphyllites, and by pulled-apart grains of K-feldspar, plagioclase, and clasts of basement \n\nrocks in the diamictites and pebbly phyllites. In mylonitic quartzites Ls consists of \n\nribbons of quartz and trains of deformed opaque minerals, and pressure shadow zones \n\ndeveloped around K-feldspar and tourmaline clasts (Fig. 4.7 C). In the gneiss and \n\nbasement derived mylonites, Ls consists of quartz ribbons, trains of elongated feldspars \n\nand aligned grains of epidote, or pulled-apart resistant grains such K-feldspars and \n\nhornblende (Fig. 4.7 D). \n\nA mineral lineation defined by hornblende and feldspars is locally observed on \n\nthe limbs of open to very tight F2 folds affecting the basement gneisses. The lineation \n\nplunges at low to high angles to the north, but the few examples (outcrop 12, N of \n\nSim\u00e3o Dias and outcrop 404, road Campo do Brito-Itabaiana, Fig. 3.1) do not allow to \n\ntrace it across the area. It might be a relict of older deformations affecting the basement. \n\nTrains of l-10m scale F2 folds are a common feature, particularly in proximity to \n\nthe regional faults, and normally show a sinistral asymmetry on the horizontal surfaces. \n\n4.4.2 - The regional faults \n\nDespite most of the regional faults having a clear signature defined on aerial \nphotographs or maps of aeromagnetic anomalies (see section 5.4) they are not as \nobvious in the field. A locality with a typical brittle fault plane has not been found, nor \ndescribed in the literature. \n\n92 \n\n\n\nA - Penetrative pressure \nsolution S2 axial planar \nfoliation imprinted in the \nhinge zone of tightly folded, \nthinly laminated \nOlhos D'agua limestones. \nOutcrop 253, southwestern \npart of the area. \n\nFigure 4.6 - The S2 foliation. \n\n9 3 \n\nB - Sub-vertical S2 slaty \ncleavage developed in the \nFrei Paulo distal turbidites \n(lithofacies PC PF3). \nBedding is defined by the \nalternated layers of light \nbrown metasiltites and \nmetapelites.

The best outcrops of these rocks are along the roads cutting \nacross the Sim\u00e3o Dias, Itaporanga and Dores faults (Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe F2 folds outside and the folds inside the fault zones are comparable in all \ntheir characteristics. They show compatible mineral assemblages along the axial planar \nfoliations, and similar orientation of the axial planes, axial planar foliations, fold axes, \nintersection lineations and mylonitic lineations. All these linear elements are nearly \nparallel and gently plunging (Fig. 4.8 A) to WNW or ESE. \n\nThe Sim\u00e3o Dias fault is a&lt;2km wide zone of imbricated steep-dipping slices \nof highly folded quartzite- and basement-derived mylonites and phyllonites, better \nexposed at the northern border of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome (outcrops 19-20, 306-307 Fig \n3.1). \n\nSeveral kinematic indicators, such as S-C relationships (Berthe et al. 1979; Lister \n\n&amp; Snoke 1984; Shimamoto 1989), porphyroblast-tail systems (Passchier &amp; Simpson \n\n1986), and shear bands (Plat &amp; Vissers 1980; Passchier 1984) all indicate top to the \n\nsouth, combined with E-W strike-slip movements (Fig. 4.8 B &amp; D). \n\nAt its eastern termination inside the Itabaiana Dome Area, the Sim\u00e3o Dias fault \n\nconsists of a &lt;lkm wide zone of sub-vertically imbricated slices of Itabaiana quartzites, \n\nRibeiropolis phyllites and basement gneisses and derived mylonites. These are tightly to \n\nisoclinally folded and exhibit a strong pencil-like intersection lineation parallel to a \n\nmineral stretching lineation (as along the Lomba river and Montes stream, and on the \n\nArrasudor farm - outcrops 888, 889, 916, 926 to 930, 933 and 934, Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe Itaporanga fault is a&lt;500m wide zone of mylonitic gneisses and \nmylonitic Olhos D'agua metacarbonates. Feldspar porphyroclast-tail systems and small-\n\nscale sigmoidal porphyroclasts and slices of carbonate rocks observed on horizontal \n\nsurfaces (nearly parallel to the XZ plane), in the mylonitic gneisses and mylonitic \n\ndolomites (outcrop 276, road Sim\u00e3o Dias to Lagarto) ail indicate a sinistral movement for \n\nthis fault. This is confirmed by subvertical, sinistral shear bands affecting polydeformed \n\nmetacarbonates elsewhere along the fault zone (Fig. 4.8 E). \n\nIn the SW comer of the area (outcrop 839, Fig. 3.1), the Itaporanga fault \n\nseparates sheared and silicified Lagarto-Palmares sandstones which dip 85\u00b0 to 356\u00b0, and \n\ncontains a striae lineation plunging 24\u00b0 to 080\u00b0, from highly folded Olhos D'\u00e0gua \n\nmetacarbonates. In a single, flat-lying outcrop at the same locality, a well-cemented and \n\nsomewhat stratified breccia, containing generally 10cm size angular c lasts of deformed \n\nOlhos D'agua metalimestones is also found. \n\nThe Dores fault zone is exposed in the road to the Volta Village in the NE \ncorner of the area (outcrop 1105, Fig. 3.1). It places subvertical, highly sheared \nquartzites and basement-derived phyllonites on Frei Paulo phyllites and is also marked \nby percolation of manganese and iron oxides. Shear bands affecting the quartzites and \nthe phyllonites respectively indicate a top to the south and a E-W sinistral strike-slip \nmovement (the latter is shown in Fig. 4.8 F). \n\n9 5 \n\n\n\n9\n6\n\n \n\nA- Small-scale very tight folds affecting phyllonites \nderived from gneisses.

This is best observed on the road from \n\nSim\u00e3o Dias to Pinh\u00e3o (outcrops 31-32), and along the secondary road from Olhos \n\nD'agua to the Vaza Barris river (outcrop 415, NE of Olhos D'agua, Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe trace of the Pelada fault corresponds in the field to a zone of intense quartz \nveining (between Macambira and Pedra Mole), and to a localised zone of shearing in the \n\nPalestina diamictites (outcrop 113, in the western part of the area, Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe Mocambo fault, as seen in the outcrops 1065 and 1066 of the Salgado \nriver (Fig. 3.1, enclosure), consists of a&lt;km wide zone of intensely foliated and \n\nbrecciated Frei Paulo metasandstones ). The outcrops do not allow any determination of \n\nthe sense of movement, but in this area the Mocambo fault controls the local E-W trend \n\nof the Salgado river and a secondary drainage (as observed on aerial photographs). \n\nThe Vaza Barris, Mocambo and Montes strike-slip faults, and the \nfaults displacing the eastern-southern border of the Itabaiana dome, are also observed on \n\nthe aerial photographs, and some can also be seen in the field. For example, sheared \n\ndiamictites with clear indication of dextral movement are observed in the Vaza Barris \n\nfault zone (outcrop 1078, northwestern part of the area, Fig. 3.1). \n\nIt is noteworthy to mention that in the aerial photographs the dextral displacement \n\nalong the Vaza Barris fault and Mocambo shear dies along their traces and vanishes \n\nparallel to the regional foliation towards the Itabaiana dome. The southeastern end of the \n\nVaza Barris fault coincides with a broad area of intense quartz veining (Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe Jacar\u00e9 fault is the most prominent of several NW-SE to WNW-ESE \ntrending lineaments observed in aerial photographs and topographic maps within and \n\noutside the southern mapped area. The fault trace roughly corresponds to a topographic \n\nbreak between 600m high hills to the south from 400m high hills to die north of it, as \n\nobserved in the 1:100,000 topographic maps used as basis for the geological mapping. \n\nThese hills are formed by the Lagarto-Palmares sandstones, which are intensely \n\nfractured, silicified and indurated (outcrops 78 and 957, southwestern part of the area, \n\nFig. 3.1). The Jacar\u00e9 fault is interpreted as a normal fault with uncertain age relative to \n\nthe other regional faults. \n\n4.4.3 - D2 deformation fabrics \n\nCommonly in rocks that contain elements with different competences, e.g. \ndiamictites with coarse-grained clasts in a fine-grained matrix, or even in mylonitic \ngneisses (Fig. 4.9), the competent grains, clasts, or porphyroclasts are typically \nfractured, pulled-apart and rotated, in order to accommodate the more ductile \ndeformation of the matrix. Pressure shadows and tails are also commonly developed \naround rigid elements in a more ductile matrix. \n\nThe fractures in the grains are filled by veins of fibrous quartz or calcite, or \nfibrous overgrowth of chlorite and sericite (Figs. 4.9 A &amp; B). The low pressure tails \ndeveloped around the coarse-grained rigid particles normally consist of dynamically \nrecrystallised quartz and feldspar, and very fine sericite, chlorite and minor biotite (Fig. \n4.9 C). \n\n98 \n\n\n\nA - Low pressure tails and \nvoids developed in a fractured \nand pulled-appart feldspar \nclast of the Palestina diamictites, \nand infilled with quartz, chlorite \nand sericite.

Outcrop 193, \nsouth of Pedra Mole. \n\nFigure 4.9 - D2 deformation fabrics. \n\n9 9 \n\n\n\nThe micaceous minerals in the tails and voids are coarser than those along the \nfoliation planes. In thin section from one locality within the Sim\u00e2o Dias gneiss (outcrop \n101, WSW of Sim\u00e3o Dias, Fig. 3.1) needles of actinolite infill the fractures in pulled-\napart fragments of hornblende. \n\n4.4.4 - Strain analyses \n\nThe deformed clasts and respective tails in the Palestina diamictites and pebbly \nphyllites generally form ellipses which are observable in many subhorizontal and \nsubvertical surfaces nearly parallel to the XZ, XY and YZ planes in the outcrops (Fig. \n4.10) and in the oriented thin sections (Fig. 4.11). \n\nA qualitative observation of hundreds of such ellipses in the field and in thin \nsections (Figs. 4.10 A-B &amp; 4.11) is sufficient to reveal that the X-parallel axis, which \nlies parallel to F2 fold axis and L1 - 2, is generally much longer than the Y-parallel axis. \n\nHowever, particularly in the core of the Paripiranga anticline, or in the hinge \nzones of larger F2 folds (outcrops 90, 239 and 299, Fig. 3.1), and in outcrops located \ncloser to the western margin of the Itabaiana dome (e.g. outcrop 987) the clasts are \ngenerally undeformed, or even rounded without any tail in the YZ plane (Figs. 4.10 C &amp; \nD), even though they are very elongated in the X direction. \n\nAn extensive quantification of the strain recorded by the clasts in the Palestina \nFormation was carried out throughout the area, by measuring the axis of the clasts in \noutcrops or in oriented thin sections. These data (Appendices A2.1-A2.3) were treated \naccording to different methods of strain quantification (Flinn 1962, 1965; Hsu 1966; \nLisle 1979; Borradaile 1981). The measurements were carried out on clasts of milky \nquartz, granite, gneiss, and grains of feldspar, which are the majority in outcrops and \nthin sections. This is an attempt to avoid extreme contrast of ductility if clasts of \nmetasediments were also studied. \n\nClasts were measured directly on surfaces nearly parallel to the XY and YZ \nplanes, in the outcrops 36, 90, 107 and 108 (Appendix A2.1). These data allowed direct \ncalculation of the X/Y and Y/Z axial ratios. The strain ellipsoids calculated using the \nmaximum and minimum ratios for each surface are plotted on Flinn's and Hsu's \ndiagrams (Figs.4.12 A &amp; B). In both the diagrams, all the finite strain ellipsoids lie in \nthe field of constriction or apparent constriction. \n\nAs displayed in Figures 4.12 A &amp; B, the strain ellipsoid calculated for outcrop 90 \nhas the most prolate of the four ellipsoids. Outcrop 90 lies in the protected core of a \n= lkm scale and open F2 fold and shows no intense S2 foliation (Fig. 3.18 C) compared \nto the other outcrops, which are characterised by tight folding and a pervasive S2 \nfoliation. \n\nIn the outcrops 44, 107, 108 and 405 (Appendix A2.2) it was possible to \n\nmeasure also the parameters S and D of Borradaile (1981), respectively for the matrix \n\nand the clasts, in surfaces nearly parallel to the XZ and YZ planes. As defined by \n\nBorradaile (1981), the ratio (S-D)/D can be considered as the minimum amount of ductile \n\ndeformation of the matrix relative to the clast, which is considered as a rigid panicle. \n\n100 \n\n\n\nA - Boulder of granite fractured \nand pulled-apart along the \nWNW-ESE structural grain of the \nPalestina diamictites.

Note that the clasts are much flatter in XZ than in YZ, and that the \nX-parallel tails are better developed and longer than the Y-parallel tails. The ellipses defined by the clast-tail systems have a greater \naxial ratio in the thin section containing the stretching lineation (parallel to X in the XZ plane) than the ratio observed in the thin \nsection perpendicular to it (YZ). \n\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n\n\n\nFigure 4.12 (A-D) - Plot of the strain ellipses calculated for the clasts of the Palestina diamictites, using the axial ratios \nin bold in Appendix A2.1. All the ellipses lie in the constrictional field on both the Flinn (1962) diagram (A), and in the \nHsu (1966) diagram, (B). Note that the most excentric strain ellipse is from outcrop 90, in both diagrams. See text. \n\n1\n0\n3\n\n \n\n\n\nEllipses defined by clasts and clasts+tails were also measured in thin sections cut \nparallel to the XZ and YZ planes of the Palestina pebbly phyllites in the outcrops 33,36, \n42, 84, 90, 111, 140, 142, 186, 188, 192, 193, 239, 246, 249, 341, 405 and 997 \n(Appendix A2.3). \n\nThe harmonic mean of the X/Z and Y/Z axial ratios were calculated for the data in \n\nAppendices A2.2 and A2.3 and are summarised in Table 4.2 . These means were also \n\nused for the computation of the parameters a, b and K of the strain ellipsoid (Flinn 1962, \n\n1965) of each outcrop (Table 4.2), whose plot in the Flinn's diagrams of Figures 4.12 C \n\n&amp; D indicates both constrictional and flattening deformation. \n\nThe graphic method of Fry (1979) was applied upon enlarged photographs of \n\nthin sections parallel to XZ and YZ planes in outcrops 186 and 188, which are \n\ncharacterised by development of intense S2 pressure foliation (Fig. 6.11). The ellipses \n\ndefined by this method were parallel to the X or Y directions, and the computation of the \n\na, b and K parameters from their axial ratios (Table 4.2) indicates strain dominated by \n\nflattening (K<0) in areas of tight folding. These results are compatible with those from \n\nthe analysis of the data for the same outcrops in the Appendix A2.3 (apart from the large \n\ndiscrepancy of values of K for outcrop 186). \n\nThus, an average shape of cigar shaped ellipsoid with circular or slightly elliptical \n\nsections perpendicular to the long axis describes the clasts in the less D2-strained areas (a \n\nprolate geometry with X>>Y>Z). In areas of more intense D2 deformation a cigar shape \n\ngeometry whose circular basal section underwent flattening in the YZ plane (X Y>Z) \n\nprobably matches the average shape of the clasts of the Palestina Formation. \n\nLisle (1979) discussed the difficulties of quantifying strain in polymict \n\nconglomeratic rocks with a marked competency contrast, and where there is practically \n\nno fluctuation (such is the case with the Palestina rocks). He proposed that in many \n\ncases the harmonic mean of the axial ratio of the clasts on each surface is a better \n\napproximation of the shape of the strain ellipse. \n\nThese conclusions are valid for the clasts in the Itabaiana quartzites and \n\nRibeir\u00f3polis pebbly phyllites on the western border of the Itabaiana dome (for example \n\nin outcrops 312, 470 and 471, Fig. 3.1), and also in the Olhos D'\u00e1gua Formation \n\n(outcrops 5, 7, 829 and 1061, all around Paripiranga). \n\n4.4.5 - Syn-D 2 vein systems \nIn thin section, highly foliated phyllites, pebbly phyllites and metacarbonates \n\nshow that quartz and calcite veins commonly cross-cut S 2 , and are also \n\ndissolved/shortened by the S2 pressure solution seams (Fig. 4.13 A). From samples of \n\ndifferent localities (for example outcrops 84, 140, and 249, Fig. 3.1) it has been \n\nobserved that the transversal veins are also affected by micro-scale F2 folds, or are \n\ndisrupted, displaced and progressively rotated to positions sub-parallel to S2. \nThe rotation of the vein segments, as well as the mineral grains or fragments, \n\nmostly occurs along, subvertical sinistral shear bands and shear fractures which trend at \n\nlow angles to the S2 foliation (Fig. 4.13 B), and less commonly along subvertical dextral \n\nshear bands and shear fractures trending at high angles to the foliation. \n\n1 0 4 \n\n\n\nTable 4.2 - Summary of the harmonic means of the X/Z and Y/Z \naxial ratios of clasts and clasts+tail, together with the \na, b, and k parametres of the finite strain ellipsoids \nplotted in the Flinn diagrams of Figure 4.12 C and D. \nCompare the k parameter obtained for outcrops 186 and 188, \nby direct measurement of clasts in thin sections and by \napplication of the Fry (1979) method to the same thin sections. \n\n[ 0 5 \n\n\n\nFigure 4.12 (continued) - Plot of the finite strain ellipsoids calculated for the clasts of the Palestina diamictites, \nusing the harmonic means in Table 4,2.

The examples occur on the Comandante farm, and mainly in \n\nthe Sim\u00e2o Dias gneisses (Fig. 3.1, enclosure), particularly along the borders of the \n\nItaporanga and Sim\u00e3o Dias faults. \n\nOn the Comandante farm, a series of NW-SE trending, generally subvertical \n\nshear zones defined by silicification, induration, and quartz veining of the the Jacar\u00e9 \n\nmetasiltites and fine sandstones, together with drag-folding of a steep dipping bedding \n\nsub-parallel penetrative foliation. In the Sim\u00e3o Dias gneiss (and less commonly in the \n\nItabaiana gneisses), the dextral movements are indicated by 10-100cm wide, subvertical \n\nductile and brittle-ductile shear bands and shear zones affecting gneisses, mylonites and \n\nphyllonites {Fig. 4.15). \n\n4.5 - The D3 Deformation \nThis is a non-penetrative event indicated by 10cm- to l0m-scale, NE-SW \n\ntrending, generally open and upright, kink-style F3 folds, 1mm-10cm size crenulations \n\nand kink bands affecting the S2 foliation and the older planar elements (Fig. 4.16). \n\nThe mesoscopic F3 folds are normally associated with a spaced cleavage axial \n\nplanar foliation (S3). The average trend of the axial plane of the F3 folds (PA3) and the \n\nS3 foliation is NE-SW in all the structural domains, and the dip normally ranges between \n\n60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, to the NW or to the SE (Fig. 4.17 A). \n\nEven in the areas where the F3 folds are absent, S3 is marked set of closely \n\nspaced, SW-NE trending, steep dipping to subvertical partition planes (Fig. 4.17 A) \n\nwhich may be marked by pressure solution seams (e.g. outcrops 880-890, along the \n\nLomba river, Fig. 3.1). This set cross-cuts the S2//S1 foliations and defines the pencil-\n\nlike L1-2 intersection lineation (e.g. Fig. 4.7 B). Finely spaced, subvertical and \n\nundeformed, and generally lcm thick quartz or carbonate veins are commonly found \n\nemplaced along these planes, particularly in phyllites, phyllonites and metacarbonates. \n\n108 \n\n\n\nA - Idealised block diagram \nshowing the top to the south \nand the WNW-ESE shear \nmovement along the planes \nof the S2 foliation in the \nPalestina diamictites.

Outcrop 1100, along the \nroad Serra do Machado to Volta. \n\nFigure 4.19 - Late-stage, post D3 deformation in the Itabaiana dome area. \n\n\n\nDetailed analysis of the aerial photographs has also revealed a regional set of \nfractures spaced at a km-scale and trending SW-NE, parallel with the S3 orientation. \nThese fractures cross-cut the WNW-ESE trending structural grain of the area, and \npartially control the drainage pattern in both the metasediments and crystalline basement, \n\nL3 linear features are the F3 fold axis (B3) and the intersection lineation (L3^2) \nwhich plunge gently to sub-vertically generally to the NE or to the SW (Fig. 4.17 B). \nThe dispersion of L3 linear features reflects the scattering of the contour of maximum \nconcentration of points from NNW to E. \n\nThe F3 folds and kinks are better developed in highly anisotropic lithologies, \nsuch as phyllitic matrix metasediments, thin horizons of metapelites within \nmetacarbonates, and basement-derived mylonites and phyllonites. \n\nThe best examples are found in those areas where S2> S0 (or S n) and S j are all \nsubvertical, probably because of the Fj and F2 structural repetition of layers of \ncontrasting competence with sub-parallel foliation planes certainly provided many \nslippery surfaces parallel to the regional anysotropy. In such areas, the transverse F3 \nfolds deform the co-axial interference pattern developed by the Fj and F2 folds (type 3 of \nRamsay 1967), as shown in Figures 4.4 B &amp; 4.18. \n\nIsolated, very broad to open style F3 folds refold the F 1 F 2 co-axial pattern, in \nareas where probably a relatively small amount of inter-foliation slip nucleated along the \nsubvertical S2//ST surfaces (as is likely the case in Fig. 4.4 B). In areas where \ncomparatively larger amounts of inter-foliation slip developed, trains of tighter F3 folds \nmay occur associated with local strike-slip faults (Fig. 4.18 D). \n\nLate-stage shearing and thrusting \nIn some localities, the subvertical S2 and S3 foliations are affected by low-angle, \n\nNNE dipping, discrete thrust-fault planes or local shear zones (Fig. 4.19) which may be \naccompanied by sets of sigmoidal tension fractures and rotated quartz veins. A top to \nSSW movement is indicated on these structures. \n\n4.6 - The structural domains \nDespite the polyphase deformation, the vertical cross-sections (AB, CD and EF \n\nof Fig. 4.20, enclosure) show a structural pattern dominated by south vergent F2 folds \nand high-angle thrust faults. The structural facing defined by small-scale F2 folds and the \nS2/S1, relationships suggest that large-scale and overturned F2 folds occur in the area. \n\nIn the Itabaiana Dome Area cross-section balancing techniques, as used in the \nfrontal parts of foreland fold and thrust belts (Dahlstrom 1969; Hossack 1979; \nWoodward et al. 1985) are difficult to apply, because of the penetrative ductile \ndeformation that the area has undergone, together with the lack of an undeformed \nstratigraphic column with which to construct an undeformed template for the restored \nsection. \n\nNon-balanced cross sections and more artistic interpretations are valid in these \nareas, particularly if they also show orogen-parallel tectonic transport (Woodward et al. \n\n116 \n\n\n\n1985 ) and pervasive ductile deformation (Cooper &amp; Trayner 1986) as is the case in the \nItabaiana Dome Area. \n\nHowever, although no attempts of line or area balancing have been done, the \nstructural cross-sections AB, CD and EF show a correspondence between the depth of \nmetasediments and the basement which is in accordance with the interpretations of the \ngravimetric and aeromagnetic data (see section 5.5). \n\nThe variations in the style of the F2 folds and in the intensity of the D2 \ndeformation, together with the variable attitude of the D j - D 2 structural elements across \nthe area, are the basis for the characterisation of the different structural domains (sections \n4.3 &amp; 4.4). \n\n4.6.1 - The cratonic domain \n\nThe sediments in the southernmost part of the largely unmetamorphosed cratonic \ndomain, and are only affected by broad NW to WNW trending folds, which are \nobserved in aerial photographs and revealed by the changing dips of the relatively flat \nlying Lagarto-Palmares sandstones. \n\nA gradual increase in the intensity of the S2 foliation is observed in many parts of \nthe southern area: the foliation starts in the south as locally observed micro crenulations \nimprinted on mudstones of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation and passes into well defined \ncleavage planes in the Jacar\u00e9 metasiltites and into a micaceous foliation in Frei Paulo \nphyllites, towards the trace of the Itaporanga fault. \n\n4.6.2 - The regional and Sim\u00e3o Dias domains \nApart from the open style of the Paripiranga anticline (Fig. 4.19 A), these \n\ndomains are characterised by generally very tight to isoclinal F2 folds with axial planes \n\ngenerally dipping 60\u00b0 to NNE. \n\nThe high amplitude/wavelength ratios generally observed in the F2 folds, which \ncommonly display overthickened hinges transposed by S2 (Fig. 4.6 A) indicates a \nsignificant amount of flattening in these folds. The intense shortening results in a nearly \nsubvertical layered sequence formed by planes of S 0 , Sn, S, and S2 planes. Thus, it is \ngenerally not easy to distinguish S1 from S2 in the field. \n\nHowever, various examples of 1-10cm-scale, co-axially refolded Ft folds are \nfound (Fig, 4.4 A), and there is also evidence of Si folded in the hinge zones of \nmesoscopic F2 folds (e.g. outcrop 45, road Sim\u00e3o Dias to Pinh\u00e3o, Fig. 3.1). In \naddition, a strong bed-parallel sericitic foliation (S 1) is well documented in the flat-lying \nFrei Paulo sandy phyllites folded by the Paripiranga anticline to the WSW of Paripiranga \n(outcrop 848, Fig. 3.1). \n\nWith the above characteristics, it does not seem to be a coincidence that in the \nregional domain the clasts of the Palestina diamictites are more flatenned in the YZ plane \nthan they are elsewhere. Also this domain is the lonely with evidence of the late-stage, \nsubhorizontal thrusts and shears described in the previous section. \n\nFinally it is noteworthy to mention that the frequency of Sr and S2- parallel \nquartz veins increases toward the northern border of the area, as observed in the \n\n117 \n\n\n\nFigure 4.21 (A-E) - Summary vertical cross sections AB and EF, respectively shown in A and B. \nThe legend and the two areas in the rectangles of B are shown in C and D (continued). \n\n118 \n\n\n\n119 \n\n\n\nFigure 4.21 E - Detailed structural relationships in the northern margin of the Itabaiana dome \n(data from outcrop 384, WSW of the town of Serra do Machado) \n\n1\n2\n0\n\n \n\n\n\nPalestina diamictites in all sections across the Vaza Barris river valley, and also within the \nRibeir\u00f3polis and Frei Paulo phyllites of the northern part of the area, which matrix is \ncoarse-grained in places than the phyllitic rocks to the west, east and south of the \nItabaiana dome (e.g. outcrops 528, 700, 701, and 1101, Fig. 3.1). \n\n4.6.3 - The Itabaiana domain \nThe F2 folds within the Itabaiana gneisses are generally more open than those in \n\nthe regional and Sim\u00e3o Dias domains, and as a consequence S2 normally cuts Sn//S1, at \nhigher angles (confirmed by the statistical analysis, Fig. 4.3 B). Rootless and generally \nrecumbent F1 folds are found in some places, mostly on the limb of the F2 folds. The \nSN//S1 surfaces are also affected by gentle to open, 100-l000m-scale F 3 folds observed \nin road cuts, dams and quarries. \n\nThe superposition of open F2 and F3 folds with orthogonal axes and vertical \naxial planes explains the scatter plot of Sn//S1 with a maximum concentration near the \ncentre of the diagram (Figs. 4.3 A &amp; B). This also explains the relative dispersion of \nL2/B2 between 270\u00b0-320\u00b0 and 090\u00b0-140\u00b0 (Fig. 4.3 C). \n\nA detailed study of the structures across the Itabaiana domain (Fig. 4.21 B), has \nrevealed important differences in the structural styles and deformational patterns in the \ngneisses and in the Itabaiana quartzites on each part of the Itabaiana dome, as \nsummarised in Figures 4.21 C-E &amp; 4.22. \n\nAt the northern border of the dome the Itabaiana quartzites are affected by m-\nscale, overturned, isoclinal, and SSW verging F2 folds (Fig.4. 21 C), and contain a \nlayer-parallel mylonitic foliation with evidence of subhorizontal shear bands indicating a \ntop to the south movement (Fig. 4.21 E). These folds are also observed within mylonitic \nquartzites and gneisses approaching the southern border (Figs. 4.22 A &amp; B). In this \narea, Humphrey &amp; Allard (1969) described imbricated slices of quartzites and crystalline \nbasement (to the NNW of Macambira). \n\nThe southern limb of the Itabaiana dome comprises mylonitic gneisses and \nquartzites folded by Z asymmetry small-scale F2 folds in cross sections (Fig. 4.21 D) \nand this relationship is confirmed by the shallower dip of the S2 foliation cutting the \nsteep-dipping to subvertical mylonitic foliation (Figs. 4.22 C &amp; D). \n\nIt can be concluded that the Itabaiana dome very probably lies in the core of a \nlarge-scale, southward verging F2 anticline, whose overturned steep-dipping southern \nlimb is cut by high-angle thrusts in the area between the Itaporanga and Sim\u00e3o Dias \nfaults (Fig. 4.21 C). These faults are likely responsible for the imbrication of subvertical \nslices of mylonitic Itabaiana quartzites, Ribeir\u00f3polis phyllites and basement-derived \nmylonites of the Lomba river, Montes stream and Arrastador farm (Fig. 3.1, enclosure). \n\nThe 700m-thick Itabaiana quartzites are only slightly deformed in the eastern \nand western parts of the dome, where different styles of deformation are observed. In \nthe eastern part of the dome, the gneisses and the quartzites are mainly cross-cut by the \nsubvertical and localised strike-slip faults (Fig. 4.1) whereas in the western pan of the \ndome, the quartzites are folded by the large-scale F2 anticlines and synclines in the Miaba \nrange (Fig. 4.1). \n\n121 \n\n\n\nA - Isoclinal, SSW verging F2 \nfolds affecting highly sheared \nItabaiana quartzites and the \ncrystalline basement (see B). \nOutcrop 334, northwest of \nS\u00e3o Domingos. \n\nB - Highly sheared Itabaiana \ngneisses affected by F2 folds \nand small-scale top to SSW \nthrust faults propagated in \nthe overturned limb.

In fact, as in the northern margin of the Itabaiana dome, the northern \n\nborder of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome comprises imbricated slices of tightly folded quartzite-\n\nand gneiss-derived mylonites (e.g. of outcrops 26, 306, 307, 1106, 1108, 1109, Fig. \n\n3.1), with vergence towards the south. \n\n4.6.4 - The west and east domains \n\nThese domains are mainly characterised by the differential intensity of the D2 \ndeformation in the succession of the metasediments, and by a nearly 25\u00b0 clockwise \n\nrotation of the directions of D2 structural elements (compare the plot of these structures \n\nwith the other domains, Figs. 4.3 B &amp; C). \n\nAll the formations above the thick quartzites show a pervasive and flat-lying S 1 \nfoliation, which dips respectively to NW and SE in the west and east domains (Fig. 4.2 \nA). However, the F2 folding is rather important in the Frei Paulo and Palestina \nFormations, whereas the Jacoca Formation commonly show D1 structures relatively \nunaffected by D 2 . Within the west domain, this pattern of deformation is better observed \nnearer the thick Itabaiana quartzites of the Miaba range, in the Capit\u00e3o farm outcrop (see \nsection 4.7). \n\nThe west and east domains are also relatively free of evidence for the D3 \n\ndeformation, but some structures compatible with this event in the west domain deserve \n\nspecial attention, in two localities of the Itabaiana-Ribeir\u00f3polis interface. \n\nIn one place (outcrop 338, WNW of Macambira, Fig. 3.1), the Ribeir\u00f3polis \n\nphyllites are affected by NNE trending, asymmetric, ESE verging, lm-scale folds. The \n\nlocation is very close to the probable contact with the Itabaiana Formation. The fold axis \n\nplunges 05\u00b0 to directions between 200\u00b0-237\u00b0 and there is also a subtle lineation (18\u00b0 to \n\n317\u00b0) defined by elongated&lt;lmm size grains of opaque minerals. \n\nIn the Miaba range (outcrop 471, Flecheira farm, Fig. 3.1), the Ribeir\u00f3polis \n\npebbly phyllites rest on Itabaiana conglomeratic quartzites with an intense layer-parallel \n\nfoliation (Fig. 4.23 A) parallel to the sheared contact. This contains fragments of \n\nquartzite and dips at 20\u00b0 to 260\u00b0 (Fig. 4.23 B). \n\nThe Itabaiana quartzites are affected by two sets of spaced cleavage (respectively \n\ndipping 75\u00b0 to 121\u00b0, and 85\u00b0 to 035\u00b0), and the pebbly phyllites are cut by a foliation \n\ndipping 40\u00b0 to 250\u00b0. The drag of this foliation approaching the shear zone, and the \n\nfractured and pulled-apart, sigmoidal-shaped clasts of milky quartz trapped within the \n\nshear zone (Fig. 4.23 C), all indicate a top to ESE sense of movement The clasts within \n\nboth Formations have a prolate shape defining an elongation lineation which plunges 15\u00b0 \n\nto 310\u00b0. \n\n123 \n\n\n\nA- White Ribeir\u00f3polis pebbly \nphyllites resting on top of \nItabaiana quartzites with a \nstrong, layer-parallel foliation. \n\nB - Detail of A above, \nshowing the sheared \ncontact.

Outcrop 471, western slope of the Miaba range. \n\n124 \n\n\n\n4.7 - The Capit\u00e3o farm outcrop \nThis outcrop (Fig. 4.24) is the largest and most important in the research area \n\nand lies in the west domain, in the junction between the Salgado and Vaza Barris rivers \n(outcrop 311, Fig. 3.1). \n\nThe outcrop is characterised by a series of mesoscopic recumbent folds \nassociated with subhorizontal thrusts and possible local duplexes that affect the Jacoca \ncarbonates just above the basal Ribeir\u00f3polis conglomerates, and by a series of small-\nscale structural relationships (Figs. 4.24 A-F &amp; details 1-8). Figures 4.24 A &amp; B are \nrespectively based on photo line drawing and on a 1:100 scale geological map of the \nbottom of the outcrop. The sketched details 1-4 are documented by the photographs of \nFigures 4.24 C-F. \n\nIn this outcrop, a layer-parallel foliation (S1) is associated with small-scale, \nrecumbent folds that affect metachert horizons inside dolomitic layers intercalated with \ndark grey phyllites (details 1-2). The Si foliation cuts the phyllitic layers at higher angle \nthan in the dolomitic layers (Figs. 4.24 C &amp; D), and it is also affected within those layers \nby generally open folds which locally evolve to kink-style, tight and asymmetric folds, \nwith a horizontal axial planar foliation (details 2-3 and Fig. 4.24 E). Many carbonate \nveins emplaced within the phyllites, and parallel to S1 (detail 4 &amp; Fig. 4.24 F), occur \nboudinaged, disrupted, pulled-apart or folded elsewhere along the same phyllitic layers \n(detail 5). \n\nTogether, these structures suggest a progressive event of layer-parallel shearing \n(D1), responsible for the simultaneous development of extensional and compressional \nfeatures which were subsequently rotated and deformed, as sketched in detail 6. \n\nSome small-scale back-folds, box folds, and low-high angle back-thrusts locally \nobserved in that outcrop also fit in such a progressive layer-parallel shearing, but with a \ncomponent of backward displacement, probably due to impossibilities for the thrust \nsheets to move further to the south. These structures also occur in the flat-lying Jacoca \ncarbonates of the east domain, which equally show strong evidence of inter-layer \nshearing superimposed on a layer-parallel S1 foliation, and back folding associated with \nsubhorizontal thrusting in small-scale (e.g outcrop 1051, Mo\u00e7as stream, Fig. 3.1). \n\nIn the Capit\u00e3o farm outcrop, the basal formations are also affected by isoclinal \nand overturned folds developed in the hanging wall of steep dipping normal faults (Figs. \n4.24 A &amp; B) which appear to merge along a subhorizontal detachment (the competent \nlayers are boudinaged along the locally sheared Ribeir\u00f3polis-Jacoca contact), resembling \na listric extensional geometry. \n\nDavison &amp; Santos (1989) interpreted the subhorizontal thrusts as a post-\nextensional feature, attributing the lack of inversion along the normal faults to the \ndifficulty of the thrusts to overcome their steep dip. It is interpreted here that the is D1 \nextension is post-D1 subhorizontal thrusting. This interpretation is supported by: (a) \nmegaboudins of the Jacoca dolomites occur several meters one from each other, along \nthe basal contact, indicating no recovering of the extension even along the low-angle \ndetachment, not only along the steeply dipping ramps; (b) one of the boudins is \ninternally folded, which is better explained if the folding happened before the extension. \n\n125 \n\n\n\n\n\nC- Intrafolial, recumbent \nF1 folds in the metachert \nlayers within marble.

To \naccommodate the down throw of the matter along the steep dipping normal fault \ndeveloped in the competent Ribeir\u00f3polis conglomerates, the thinly interlayered \ndolomites, metachert and phyllites probably acted more ductilely than two layers of more \nmassive dolomites of the basal Jacoca Formation. \n\nThe basal dolomitic layer was boudinaged along the sheared contact with the \nconglomerates (detail 8), whereas the thinly interlayered dolomites above the steep \ndipping normal fault were ductilely deformed in a roll-over syncline-anticline pair, so \nthat the matter migrated from the limbs to the hinge of the folds, in a way similar to the \nconvergent bed-parallel shearing described by Higgs et al. (1991) for such situations. \n\nThe overlying massive dolomites initially accommodated the folding of the thinly \ninterlayered sequence. With the continued extension, the progressive thinning of the limb \nof the fold nearer to the fault was brittly faulted (detail 7) and the progressive tightening \nand overturning of the syncline-anticline pair led to more thickening of the hinge. The \nreverse fault started to propagate in the overturned limb of the fold pair within the \nmassive dolomites, probably because the more competent duplicated layer could not \naccommodate the final stage of tightening of the fold. \n\nThe set of closely spaced and steep-dipping fractures which cuts the laminated \nrocks and the layer-parallel S1 foliation, just in the area above the horizontal extension of \nthe dolomites and conglomerates (left side, Fig. 4.24 B)f is interpreted as a local \naccommodation to the extension, even though the fractures show orientations compatible \nwith S2 in other parts of the area. \n\n4.8 - Metamorphism in the Itabaiana Dome Area \nMetamorphic conditions in the Itabaiana Dome Area are indicated by seriate, \n\nchlorite, biotite found normally along with the S1, and S2 regional foliations, together \n\nwith quartz and feldspars (Fig. 4.4 D). Epidote occurs as a transformation of hornblende \n\nin the basement rocks and derived mylonites (section 3.3.1). \n\n128 \n\n\n\nSericite, Chlorite and biotite (and locally actinolite, section 4.4.3) are also found \nas fibrous overgrowths along the pressure shadow tails and voids associated with the \ndeformed clasts and porphyroclasts observed in metasediments and in basement rocks \nand derived mylonites (Figs. 4.9 A &amp; C). \n\nThe data may even suggest a direct timing relationship between metamorphism \n\nand D1 and D2 deformational events. However, as porphyroblast-matrix relationships \n\nare absent in the Itabaiana Dome Area, nor they have been described elsewhere in the \n\nsouthern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, it can only be suggested, on the basis of the \n\nmineral assemblages and textural relationships above, that the metamorphism generally \n\nranges from sub- to greenschist conditions, and that the basement underwent \n\nmetamorphism at higher temperatures than the metasediments. \n\nIn fact, Essene (1989) states that if the temperatures of the greenschist facies \n\nnormally range within 300\u00b0-450\u00b0C, the presence of hornblende-epidote paragenesis \n\nimplies the extension of the upper limit of this facies to 450\u00b0-550\u00b0C. \n\nActually, the similar deformational processes observed in the resistant grains of \nthe diamictites, pebbly phyllites and mylonites (section 4.4.3), which are attributed in the \ngeneral literature to processes like fracturing and cataclasis, frictional sliding, diffusive \nmass transfer and crystal plasticity (McClay 1977; Knipe 1989), together with the ductile \ndeformation of the highly strained quart grains, have all been interpreted as compatible \nwith greenschist, up to low amphibolite metamorphism in other deformed areas \n(Simpson 1985; Carl et al. 1991). \n\nThe higher frequency of syn-D2 and syn-D3 quartz veins, and the increased \ngrain size of the micaceous minerals, observed toward the northern part of the area \n(section 4.6.2) suggest that probably there was also a slightly positive gradient of \ntemperatures of the metamorphism, northward from the cratonic domain. \n\n4.9 - Discussion and conclusions \n\nThe results of the structural analysis in the Itabaiana Dome Area indicate that the \nsouthern part of Sergipano Fold Belt underwent a polyphase, ductile to ductile-brittle \nprogressive deformation (D r D 3 ) responsible for the SSW directed tectonic transport of \nthe rocks toward the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\nBasement and cover were involved in the F2 folding and thrusting and also in the \nD3 deformation. On the basis of the strong coincidence of styles and similar orientation \nof each of the F1, F2 and F3 folding events, on the similar orientation of D , , D2 and D3 \nstructural elements, and similar ductile D1 deformation under greenschist facies, it is \ninterpreted that the basement was also reworked during D1. \n\nThe D j deformation can be interpreted as a progressive event of layer-parallel \nshearing and shortening which developed the pervasive S1 foliation, shearing of the \nbasement-cover, rootless intra-folial F1 folds, and low-angle thrust faulting. The best \nexpression of these structures are found in the Capit\u00e3o farm outcrop (Fig. 4.24), but \nthere is other evidence outside the Itabaiana Dome Area. \n\n129 \n\n\n\nFor example, Santos et al. (1988) described recumbent folds coaxially folded by \nF2 folds, in a large outcrop just beyond the northwestern corner of this thesis area, and \nJardim de S\u00e1 et al. (1986) described F| recumbent folds and subhorizontal thrusting, 25 \nkm inside the craton, in the Patamute area (west of the Tucano basin, Fig. 2.3). \n\nD2 deformation records a progressive shortening by nearly upright folding and \nhigh-angle, southward vergent thrusting, with a component of orogen-parallel strike-slip \nmovement, probably under a sinistral transpressive regime. The regional faults are \ninterpreted to be the zones of strain concentration in the D2 progressive shortening and \nwrenching. The displacement along most of these faults combines a top to the south with \na E-W sinistral strike-slip movement, D3 is interpreted as a non penetrative event of \ntransversal shortening and extension. \n\nThese interpretations are supported by several features which match with \ndescriptions of other deformed belts which show a combination of shortening and \nwrenching strains, such as the parallelism of fold axes and stretching lineations, both \nperpendicular or at high-angle with the direction of tectonic transport (Lagarde &amp; \nMichard 1986; Ridley 1986; Ellis &amp; Watkinson 1987), together with the interfoliation \nslip along strike and dip of the axial plane foliation of the regional folds (Ghosh 1982). \n\nThe deformation patterns, as revealed by the abundant strain markers, indicate \nthese movements along the regional faults and also within metasediments away from the \nfault zones, comparing well with deformation predominantly by simple shear (e.g. \nVauchez et al. 1987). \n\nThe mutual cross-cutting relationships between S2 and the quartz and carbonate \nveins, which are folded, disrupted and rotated by extensional shear bands nearly parallel \nto S2, are commonly found in polydeformed areas, and are normally interpreted as die \nresult of strain hardening after the development of a highly anisotropic sequence, \nindicative of a progressive deformation (Piatt &amp; Vissers 1980). In such cases, the veins \nprobably represent events of orogen-parallel extension and orogen-parallel slip, a typical \nfeature of strike-slip regimes (Jamison 1991).They are emplacedin the final stages of the \nductile deformation, before the deformation enters into the brittle field (Paschier 1984). \n\nBecause D2 shortening and the top to the south shearing probably occurred at \nvarious intensities along strike, most of the F2 folds should have curved hinges at a \nregional scale (non-cylindrical folds of Williams &amp; Chapman 1979). This may account \nfor the double plunge of L2 described both in the Itabaiana Dome Area (Fig. 4.3) and to \nthe west of the Tucano basin (e.g. Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986; Moraes et al. 1987). A \ndegree of differential slip along the strike of S2, S v S0 and S n , may also account for the \nfan of directions indicated by the plunge of L3 throughout the area (Fig. 4.17). \n\nThe overall prolate geometry of the deformed strain markers in the Itabaiana \nDome area suggests a constrictional strain parallel to the orogen, superimposed by a \ncomponent of flattening during D 2 . However, as part of the finite strain is most probably \ndue to D1? not all the elongation parallel to the orogen can be taken as evidence of D 2 -\nrelated strike-slip displacement. \n\nThe micro structures and the deformational processes observed in the diamictites, \n\npebbly phyllites and basement-derived mylonites are very similar in the Itabaiana Dome \n\n130 \n\n\n\nArea, suggesting equivalent mechanical behaviour during the deformation. \nNevertherless, the precise determination of the bulk or the average strain in the research \narea is made difficult by factors inherent to the Palestina rocks. For example the very fine \nmatrix contrasts with the size of the clasts, which in turn are composed derived from \nvaried lithologies (Ramsay 1967; Hossack 1968; Lisle 1979; Ramsay &amp; Huber 1987). \nRamsay (1967) showed that the final shape of a deformed clast is largely dependent of \nits original orientation relative to the finite strain ellipsoid (the Rf/\u00f8 method), but Lisle \n(1979) does not recommend the application of the Rf/\u00f8 technique in cases where the \nangle of fluctuation is small or even absent, as is the case in the Ttabaiana Dome Area. \n\nDespite the above uncertainties, Borradaile (1981) predicted that for rocks with a \nlarge ductility contrast, the clasts probably become parallel to the direction of maximum \nextension, at only small values of the finite strain. The differences between the K values \nof the finite strain ellipsoid for the same outcrop (compare outcrops 90 and 107, Fig. \n4.12 A &amp; Table 4.2) may be attributed to angular errors in assuming that the \nmeasurement plane is the XZ plane of the finite strain ellipsoid, as well as to the orders \nof magnitude difference in sizes between clasts in outcrops and clasts in thin section. \n\nIn the Itabaiana Dome Area some strain has been absorbed by the ductile \nelongation of clasts, but also the harmonic means of (S-D)/D (Appendix A2.3) indicate \nsuperimposition of approximately 65% of shortening of the matrix around the clasts. \nThis highlights the importance of flattening during the D2 deformation in the Itabaiana \nDome Area, particularly where the F2 folds are tight to isoclinal. \n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the larger values of K calculated for the finite \nstrain ellipsoids of clasts+tail as compared with the K values for clasts alone (Table 4.2; \nFigs. 4.12 C &amp; D). The increase in the X and Y axes of the ellipsoids reflects the \nimportance of pressure solution processes associated with the S2 foliation. As a result of \nflattening of the matrix together with the elongation of the clasts, the D2 deformation \ndeveloped an intense L to L-S tectonite fabric in the Itabaiana Dome Area. \n\nAs a result of the heterogeneous distribution of lithologies together with the \nstyles and intensity of deformation and metamorphism, six structural domains have been \nrecognised in the Itabaiana Dome Area. These are - the cratonic, regional, west and east \ndomains - all formed by sediments and their deformed and metamorphosed counterparts, \nand the Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itabaiana domains, which comprise the ductilely reworked \ngneissic basement. \n\nA sub- to greenschist metamorphism is recorded from the cratonic to the regional \ndomains, but the gneissic domains probably underwent higher temperature deformation \nat the same facies, as recorded by the hornblende-epidote paragenesis along the \nmetamorphic banding (Sn) and along the S1 foliation. \n\nThe results of this detailed structural analysis of the Itabaiana Dome Area place \nconstraints on the tectonic evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt in \nthat explanations are required for -\n\n1 - The coincidence between the stretching lineation in the mylonites and the L2 \nlinear elements throughout the area. \n\n2 - The characteristics of the structural domains, in particular those of the \n\n131 \n\n\n\nItabaiana dome, e.g - The contact and the deformation relationships in different sides of \nthe Itabaiana dome; - The shift of the trend of the D1-D2 structural elements around the \ndome; and the role of the dome itself and the thick Itabaiana quartzites in the deformation \nof the area. \n\nThese aspects are addressed in the discussion in Chapter 6. \n\n132 \n\n\n\nChapter 5 - Geophysics of the Itabaiana Dome Area \n\n5.1 - Introduction \nThis chapter presents new gravity and magnetic data collected specifically for this \n\nthesis, and is the first analysis of the nature of the crust in the southern part of the \nSergipano Fold Belt. Previously published aeromagnetic and radiometric data are also \nused in combination with the new data. \n\nAll the data were processed and analysed in the laboratories of the CPRM \n(Companhia de Pesquisas de Recursos Minerais, Salvador, Brazil), by Dr. A.C. Motta. \nThe results, which form the basis of this chapter, have been presented in an unpublished \nreport by Motta (1990) but the correlations between the geology and geophysics are \nresponsibility of the author. \n\nThis chapter contains 8 figures (Figs. 5.1-5.8), one table (Table 5.1), and an \nappendix with the data used for the construction of the geophysical cross section \n(Appendices A3.1-A3.4). \n\n5.2 - Summary of the geophysical and density data of the Itabaiana Dome \nArea \n\n5.2.1 - Geophysical data \nIn order to analyse the nature of the upper crust of the southern part of the \n\nSergipano Fold Belt, gravity and magnetic data were collected in the Itabaiana Dome \nArea, along three section lines, labelled XX', YY' and ZZ' in Figure 5.1. \n\nSections XX' and YY' were chosen since they cut across the basement domes, in \nthe same position of the cross sections AB and EF (Fig. 4.20, enclosure). Section ZZ' \nwas chosen since it is a southern continuation of the NW-SE trending geophysical \nsection carried out in the area of the Carira Project (Santos et al. 1988). This is \ndesignated Z'Z\" in Figure 5.2, and the interpretation has already been shown in the \nFigure 2.8. \n\nGravity and magnetic data were collected in the field using a Lacoste-Romberg \ngravimeter (accuracy of 0.01 mGal), and a Geometries magnetometer (Canada), model \nG-816 (year 1979; accuracy of 1 nT). \n\nThe gravity survey was calibrated with a value of 978167.41mGals \ncorresponding to the absolute value of the gravity field at the town of Itabaiana, in the \nBrazilian national gravity grid (Observat\u00f3rio Nacional, IBGE, according with Motta \n1990). The observed and calculated gravity data are shown in Appendices A3.1-A3.3 . \n\nThe altitude of each field station was obtained by closed levelling traverses, and \nthe geographic coordinates of each point were derived directly from the planialtimetric \nmaps at 1:100,000 scale (the same as in the geological map, Fig. 3.1, enclosure). \n\nThis chapter has also utilised aeromagnetic and radiometric data available for the \nsouthern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Encal 1978). These are shown in the \n\n133 \n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 - Grid of geographic coordinates with the location \nof the geophysical section lines in the area of this study (XX', \nYY' and ZZ') and the continuation of the ZZ' section line in the \nsoutheastern part of the area of the Carira Project (Z'Z\"). \n\n134 \n\n\n\n1:100,000 scale contour map of total intensity of the earth's magnetic field (Fig. 5.3) and \nin the 1:100,000 scale contour map of total radiometric values (Fig. 5.4). \n\nBecause the aeromagnetic data of Figure 5.3 are already filtered and free of the \ninfluence of very shallow magnetic sources, unlike the magnetic data collected directly in \nthe field (which show a wide variation over small distances), the ground magnetic data \nhave not been utilised in the interpretation presented in this chapter. \n\nMotta (1990) chose to interpret the magnetic profiles along sections XX' and \nYY' by using the aeromagnetic data presented by Encal (1978). The observed and \ncalculated anomaly data used for the aeromagnetic interpretation of sections XX', YY' \nand ZZ' are given in Appendices A3.1-A3.3 . \n\nComputer modelling of the geophysical data was carried out using programmes \nGeosoft Magpoly (2.1), and Geosoft Gravpoly (2.1), both by Patterson, Grant and \nWatson Ltd. 1984, (Canada). This software is officially used by the CPRM-Brazil for \ngeophysical interpretations (Motta 1990). \n\n5.2.2 - Density data \nIn order to permit quantitative interpretation of the gravity data, 85 samples of \n\nvarious rock types in the Itabaiana Dome Area were collected for density determinations. \n\nThe results of the density determinations are presented in Appendix A3.4 and \nsummarised in Table 5.1. The average density of 80 samples of all rock types is 2.62 \n\ng/cm3. The average density of 52 samples of metasediment is 2.61 g/cm3, and the \n\naverage density of 28 samples of crystalline basement rock is 2.64 g/cm3. \n\nThe average density for different types of non-basement rock is also shown in \n\nTable 5.1: phyllites = 2.56 g/cm3; metasandstones = 2.61 g/cm3; diamictites and pebbly \n\nphyllites = 2.62 g/cm3; limestones = 2.68 g/cm3; and quartzites = 2.53 g/cm3. \n\nIn order to use maximum density contrast for the computer modelling, Motta \n\n(1990) adopted 2.64 g/cm3 as the average density for the upper crust in the southeastern \n\npart of the Sergipano Fold Belt, and 2.57 g/cm3 for the metasediments. Thus the \n\nmaximum density contrast between basement and cover in the southern part of the \n\nSergipano Fold Belt was taken as 2.64 - 2.57 = 0.07 g/cm3. \n\nThe upper crust was then modelled in terms of blocks of basement and \nmetasediment, each with a density contrast relative to the average density of the crust \n(2.64), by considering the nature of the rocks on each part of the geological cross \nsections. Block boundaries and shapes were constrained by surface geology interpreted \nfrom the author's geological map and cross sections (Figs. 3.1 &amp; 4.20). \n\n5.3 - Geophysical domains \n\nA detailed analysis of the aeromagnetic anomalies of Figure 5.3 has permitted \nidentification of six geophysical domains (named A- F), each with a characteristic pattern \nof isolines and range of values (Motta 1990). \n\n135 \n\n\n\nRock - Mean density \n\nBasement complex - 2.64 \n\nPhyllites - 2.56 \n\nMetasandstones - 2.61 \n\nDiamictites - 2.62 \n\nLimestones - 2.68 \n\nQuartzites - 2.53 \n\nTable 5.1 - Summary of the average \ndensities of rocks of the \nItabaiana dome area. \n\nI 3 6 \n\n\n\nComparing the geophysical domains of Figure 5.3, with the geological map of \nFigure 3.1 (enclosure), it can be seen that each geophysical domain corresponds to rock \ntypes with distinct magnetic properties. \n\n5.3.1 - Domain A \nThis domain occupies a roughly circular-shaped area with the town of Itabaiana \n\nin the centre (Fig. 5.3). It comprises aeromagnetic anomalies generally ranging from -\n100 nT to -300 nT (dominantly between -100 nT and -200 nT) which form ellipsoids \nwhose 2-4km long axis is generally oriented east-west. The shape of these anomalies is \nmost likely a function of the line spacing (2km; Fig. 5.3) \n\nThese elliptical anomalies also occur along a relatively narrow zone which \nextends to the east of Moita Bonita, as far as the Sergipe river (Fig. 5.3). Comparing this \nfigure with the geological map of Figure 3.1, domain A corresponds to outcrops of the \nItabaiana gneiss. The continuity of these anomalies towards the northeastern corner of \nthe area of this study (Fig. 5.3) probably corresponds to shallowly buried basement, \nbrought near to the surface by the Dores thrust (section 4.4.2). \n\n5.3.2 - Domain B \nDomain B consists of aeromagnetic anomalies which have the same elliptical \n\nshape of those in domain A, but the length of the ellipses is generally smaller, and the \nvalues generally range between -50 nT and -100 nT. These anomalies occur in two sub-\nareas adjacent to the western side of domain A (Fig. 5.3). \n\nOne sub-area of domain B occurs as an E-W trending narrow strip that passes \naround Sim\u00e3o Dias and spreads to the east and west of that town. Another sub-area \nsurrounds the junction of the Salgado and Vaza Barris rivers. Comparison with the \ngeological map of Figure 3.1 (enclosure) shows that the anomalies within the E-W \nnarrow strip of domain B correspond to most of the outcrop area of the Sim\u00e3o Dias \ngneisses. \n\nThe continuation of the same pattern of aeromagnetic anomalies to the western \nborder of the study area also indicates that the Sim\u00e3o Dias gneiss most probably \ncontinues westward of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, and are probably buried at shallow levels \nbelow the metasediments. A similar interpretation applies to the sub-area surrounding the \njunction of the Salgado and Vaza Barris rivers, where surface outcrops generally consist \nof rocks of the Miaba Group. \n\nThe aeromagnetic map of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt at \n1:250,000 scale (Encal 1978) has shown that domain B can be traced continuously \nwestwards from around Sim\u00e3o Dias as far as the eastern border of the Tucano basin, \noutside the area of this study (Motta 1990). \n\n5.3.3 - Domain C \nDomain C has a magnetic signature of typically straight isolines whose values \n\nrange widely in a small distance across their strike. They occur to the north, south and \nwest of domain A (Fig. 5.3). \n\n137 \n\n\n\nThe straight contours to the north of domain A are continuous toward the \n\nnorthwestern corner of the study area. A similar pattern of anomalies is observed along \n\nthe northern border of the Sim\u00e3o Dias gneiss (domain B) just to the west of the Itabaiana \n\ndome. \n\nThe anomalies of domain C correspond major fault zones within the southern \n\npart of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Motta 1990). These features are further discussed in \n\nsection 5.4 . \n\n5.3.4 - Domain D \n\nThis domain comprises a narrow WNW-ESE trending zone along the Vaza Barris \n\nriver valley, in the southeastern corner of the Itabaiana Dome Area (Fig. 5.3). \n\nThe anomalies of domain D are similar to those in domains A and B, and \n\ncorrespond to a continuation of outcrops of the Sim\u00e3o Dias gneisses to the southeastern \n\npart of the study area, where they probably correspond to exposed slices of basement \n\nrocks described by Davison &amp; Santos (1989) at the eastern end of the Itaporanga fault. \n\nIn that area, the trace of the Itaporanga fault follows the Vaza Barris river valley, and \n\npasses through the town of Itaporanga D'Ajuda (Fig. 2.3). \n\nThus, the 45 km long strip of outcrops of the Sim\u00e3o Dias gneisses mapped in the \n\nItabaiana Dome Area (this study), represents the exposed portion of a E-W trending \n\nsubvertical slice of the crystalline basement which is at least 100 km long. This slice was \n\ntectonically emplaced parallel to the structural grain of the southern part of the Sergipano \n\nFold Belt, very close to its boundary with the adjacent craton. \n\n5.3.5 - Domain E \n\nDomain E shows a pattern of concentric anomalies whose values range from \n\n+ 100 nT to -275 nT and which are much more circular and broader than the anomalies \n\nof domains A and B (Fig. 5.3). \n\nThese anomalies occur in wide areas to the north and south of domain B, and \n\ncorrespond in the field to outcrops of the sediments and metasediments of the Miaba, \n\nLagarto and Vaza Barris Groups (see the geological map of Fig. 3.1). They also occur in \n\na wide area to the east of domain A. where they correspond to the sediments of the \n\nSergipe-Alagoas basin. \n\n5.3.6 - Domain F \n\nDomain F has the same characteristics as domain E, but the aeromagnctic \n\nanomalies are even broader, and the values generally range between -25 nT and -75 nT \n\n(Fig. 5.3). These anomalies occur in the northern part of the study area, where the Frei \n\nPaulo and Ribeir\u00f3polis Formations are dominant. Another two similar areas are situated \n\nto the south of the study area. \n\nIt can be seen from the geological map (Fig. 3.1) that these anomalies correspond \n\nto outcrops of sediments of the Sergipe-Alagoas basin (around Itaporanga DAjuda in \n\nFig. 5.3) and sediments of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation (in the southwestern comer \n\nof the study area). \n\n138 \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the aeromagnetic anomalies associated with the exposed or \nshallowly buried crystalline basement (domains A, B and D) show a greater variation \nthan those elsewhere (domains E and F). The pattern can be interpreted as due to a \ngenerally greater content of magnetic minerals in the basement than elsewhere (and to the \nheterogeneous distribution of basic rocks within the gneisses, as is discussed in the next \nsection). This has been confirmed during the collection of the field measurements, by the \nvery low magnetic susceptibilities of the sediments and metasediments (Motta 1990). \n\n5.3.7 - The basement domains and radiometric data \nFrom a detailed analysis of the radiometric anomalies shown in the map of Figure \n\n5.4 (where the geological boundaries of the Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias gneisses have also \nbeen drawn), it can be seen that the crystalline basement has a distinct radiometric \nsignature compared with that of the rest of the area. The areas occupied by the Itabaiana \ndome and by the broadest part of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome are characterised by circular to \nelliptical anomalies with values of radioactivity normally less than 100 cps (scintillations \nper second), whereas these values range between 200 cps and 300 cps in most of the rest \nof the area (Fig. 5.4). \n\nHowever, inside the Itabaiana dome there are values between 100 cps and 200 \ncps, particularly between Itabaiana and Moita Bonita, and also to the southeast of \nItabaiana (Fig. 5.4). The lower values can be attributed to basement of more basic \ncomposition, and the higher values to basement of more acid composition, possibly \nreflecting the heterogeneous nature of the older crust (Motta 1990). \n\nGeological mapping shows (Fig. 3.1) that the basic rocks are more predominant \nin the south, west and northwestern parts of the Itabaiana dome. Although the field work \nwas not carried out with the principal aim of separating basic and acid rocks in the \nbasement (nor it would be accurately possible because of the discontinuous nature of the \nbasement outcrops), it is clear that the basement is heterogeneous, particularly in the \nItabaiana Dome Area. \n\nThe above supports the interpretation by Motta (1990) that the basement can be \nsub-divided into blocks with subtle density contrasts. \n\n5.4 - Aeromagnetic signature of the regional faults in the Itabaiana Dome \nArea \nFigure 5.5 A-B displays part of the 1:250,000 scale map with the aeromagnetic \n\nanomalies of the southeastern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Encal 1978). This \nhighlights the correlation between the linear aeromagnetic anomalies (typical of domain \nC) and regional faults, particularly in the Itabaiana Dome Area, as originally interpreted \nby Motta (1990). \n\nThe fault zones corresponding to the S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo fault (Santos et al. \n1988; Davison &amp; Santos 1989) and to the Itaporanga, Sim\u00e3o Dias, Vaza Barris and \nMocambo faults (this study) are indicated in Figure 5.5 A. The aeromagnetic anomalies \nfor the Itabaiana Dome Area are separated in Figure 5.5 B, but without the fault lines. \n\n1 3 9 \n\n\n\n140 \n\n\n\nFigure 5 - 5 - The aeromagnetic signature of the main \nregional faults. \n(A): Map showing the aeromagnetic linear anomalies \ncoincident with some of the regional faults within the \neastern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. The numbers \nin the isolines are values in \u00b5T (Modified from Motta \n1990). \n(B): Reproduction of the same aeromagnetic data for \nthe area of this study, without the trace of the regional \nfaults. \n(C): Simplified copy of the geological map of Figure \n2.4, highlighting the Serra Pelada and Mocambo \nfaults. \n\n\n\n140 \n\nFigure 5 . 5 - The aeromagnetic signature ol the main \nregional faults \n(A): Map showing the aeromagnetic linear anomalies \ncoincident with some of the regional faults within the \neastern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. The numbers \nin the isolines are values in uT (Modified from Motta \n1990). \n(B): Reproduction of the same aeromagnetic data for \nthe area of this study, without the trace of the regional \nfaults. \n(C): Simplified copy of the geological map of Figure \n2.4, highlightng the Serra Pelada and Mocambo \nfaults. \n\n\n\nFigure 5.5 C is a reduced copy of the geological map (Fig. 2.4), highlighting the \narray of regional faults previously identified in the geological maps of the Itabaiana \nDome Area. By comparing Figures 5.5 A-C, it is possible to see that the aeromagnetic \nsignature of the Mocambo fault (Figs. 5.5 A &amp; B) only partially corresponds to the trace \nadopted for the same fault in previous geological maps of the area (Fig. 5.5 C). \n\nIn contrast, the trace of the Mocambo fault, as shown in Figure 5.5 A, seems to \nbe much more realistic than that adopted in Figure 5.5 C, and additionally does not \nexclude the Pelada fault. As such, the Mocambo fault as now identified, fits with the \nentire aeromagnetic signature, and also fits with field observations described in sections \n3.3.4 and 4.4.2. \n\n5.5 - Geophysical sections in the Itabaiana Dome Area \nFigures 5.6 A, 5.7 A and 5.8 A (all in the enclosure) show profiles of the \n\nobserved and calculated gravity and aeromagnetic data along the XX', YY', and ZZ' \nsection lines. The gravity interpretative sections are shown respectively in Figures 5.6 B, \n5.7 B and 5.8 B, and the aeromagnetic interpretative sections are shown in Figures 5.6 \nC, 5.7 C and 5.8 C. The interpretations have also taken into consideration the \nradiometric data (section 5.3). \n\nThe crystalline basement was tentatively divided into blocks bounded by several \nconvex upward surfaces, resembling the geometry of listric thrust faults which dip at \nhigh angles at the surface and become gradually subhorizontal with depth. Both the \nbasement and the metasediments were tentatively divided into blocks with a contrast of \ndensities, as generally indicated by the profiles (after the original report by Motta 1990). \n\nComparing the gravity and aeromagnetic profiles of Figures 5.6 and 5.7, it can \nbe seen that the gravity and magnetic interpretative profiles of the upper crust are \ngenerally in good agreement, with only local discrepancies. \n\nAlso comparing these profiles with the geological cross sections across the \nbasement domes (AB and EF, Fig. 4.20, enclosure) it can be seen that, despite the small \namount of geophysical data, the geophysical interpretations support the depth of the \nbasement and metasediments adopted in the geological cross sections. \n\n5.5.1 - The geophysical section XX' \nThe observed and calculated Bouguer profiles of Figure 5.6 A show increasing \n\nvalues from south to north, although there is a depression between 26 km and 35 km. \nThe concave upward part of the curve corresponds to the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome and to buried \nblocks of the basement close to the surface, immediately to the north of it, because their \naverage density (2.64) is higher than the density of the metasediments (Motta 1990). \n\nThe saddle in the 26-35 km interval may be explained by the greater thickness of \nthe less dense metasediments in the Vaza Barris trough, between the Pelada and Escarpa \nfaults, an area where the basement occurs at depths as great as 4 km (Fig. 5.6 B). \n\nMotta (1990) points out two minor differences between the aeromagnetic and the \ngravity interpretation. One difference is related to a marked break of the aeromagnetic \n\n141 \n\n\n\nvalues between 10 and 15 km, in the southern part of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, and the \nother concerns the depth of the basement to the north of the Pelada and Mocambo faults \n(Fig. 5.6 A-C). \n\nAt the southern border of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, the aeromagnetic interpretation \nhas placed the blocks numbered 8 and 9 inside the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome (block 1) with \ndifferent magnetic susceptibilities, whereas the gravity profile could be modelled as a \nsingle block of uniform density (Fig. 5.6 B). \n\nIn the area to the north of the Pelada fault, the aeromagnetic data (Fig. 5.6 C) \nindicate that the basement occurs at a depth less than 2 km, and continues at this depth \nimmediately to the north of the Mocambo fault. \n\nThe gravity profile (Fig. 5.6 B) also suggests that the basement occurs at depths \nless than 2 km between the Pelada and Mocambo faults, but is deeper toward the \nMocambo fault and across it, along a steeper gradient than in Figure 5.6 C. \n\n5.5.2 - The geophysical section YY' \nThe observed and calculated Bouguer curves in this profile (Fig. 5.7 A) decrease \n\ncontinuously from SSW (Y) to 40 km NNE (Y'), where they reach a minimum and start \nto increase slightly towards the end of the profile. \n\nIn detail, the plot of the observed and calculated Bouguer data across the \nItabaiana dome (Fig. 5.7 A) shows open and sinusoidal variations along the profile, \nwhich Motta (1990) interpreted to be the result of several blocks with subtle density \ncontrasts (Fig. 5.7 B). Most of the anomaly corresponds to the Itabaiana dome, which is \nbounded to the north by the Mocambo fault (Fig. 5.7 B). The relative depth of the \nbasement just to the north of this fault is 4 km, and becomes gradually shallower \ntowards the end of the profile. \n\nThe aeromagnetic profile shows a pronounced low corresponding to the \nMocambo fault (Fig. 5.7 A). The aeromagnetic interpretation of Figure 5.7 C is in good \nagreement with the gravity interpretation, except for the area to the north of the Mocambo \nfault, where it has not been possible to distinguish between basement and cover (Motta \n1990). \n\n5.5.3 - The geophysical section ZZ'Z\" \n\nFigure 5.8 A shows the gravity and aeromagnetic data along the composite \nZZ'Z\" profile. Figure 5.8 B displays the gravity interpretation across the northern border \nof the study area, and also across the boundary between the southern and northern parts \nof the Sergipano Fold Belt, which is marked by the S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo fault, \naccording to Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp; Santos (1989). \n\nThe Bouguer curves show positive values in the 0-94 km interval, and \ncorrespond to two gravity highs (named I and II in Fig. 5.8 A), which are separated by a \ngravity low (named III). \n\nThe first high (I) corresponds to the outcrops of Itabaiana gneiss on the western \nside of the Itabaiana dome, and to the buried crystalline basement between the Mocambo \nand S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo faults. The second high (II) occurs in the northern part of the \n\n142 \n\n\n\nprofile, and corresponds to that part of the Sergipano Fold Belt between the S\u00e3o Miguel \ndo Aleixo and Belo Monte-Jeremoabo faults (Fig. 5.8 B). \n\nThe interpretation of the Bouguer profile for the northern part of the Sergipano \nFold Belt agrees with the geophysical interpretation shown in Figure 2.8. Northward of \n94km the negative Bouguer values in the profile reflect the greatest thickness of \nmetasediments in the Sergipano Fold Belt, which can be 13km (Santos et al. 1988). \n\nThe gravity low (III) corresponds to outcrops of metasediment between the two \ngravity highs, which extend to an average depth of 3.5km. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that in this gravity profile, the depth of the basement \ndecreases from 2km, just to the north of the Mocambo fault, to 5km at the edge of the \nstudy area (Fig. 5.8 B). The depth of 2km, and the smoother gradient of the depth of the \nbasement shown in this profile, are in accordance with the depth and gradient of depths \nof the basement in the aeromagnetic interpretation of Figure 5.6 C, rather than with the \nstronger gradient for the depth to the basement in the gravity interpretation (Fig. 5.6 B). \n\nFigure 5.8 B also shows several bodies of rocks with average density of 2.57 or \n2.55 (see blocks 6, 7, 9 and 10). Blocks 6, 9 and 10 correspond to outcrops of granite \nin the northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Motta 1990). Block 7, which lies \nbetween the edge of the study area and the S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo fault, corresponds to \nthe outcrops of Itabaiana quartzite (see the Campina and Redonda Ranges, Fig. 3.1), and \noutcrops of phyllites, pebbly phyllites and metavolcanics of the Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation \n(this study). \n\nHowever, the above interpretation does not eliminate the possibility of buried \ngranitic bodies within or in the vicinity of block 7, just in the footwall of the S\u00e3o Miguel \ndo Aleixo fault. \n\nThe aeromagnetic profiles of Figure 5.8 A show two accentuated lows. The low \nat around 14km corresponds to the Mocambo fault (Fig. 5.8 B), whereas the low \nbetween 5 and 8km does not have a straightforward explanation from the surface \ngeology. \n\nIt may correspond to faults or subvertical mylonitic zones within the Itabaiana \ndome, an area generally covered by the colluvium of the Miaba range (Fig. 3.2). \nAlternatively, it could correspond to blocks with different magnetic susceptibilities within \nthe crystalline basement, in the same way as has been interpreted for the Sim\u00e3o Dias \ndome (blocks 8 and 9, Fig. 5.6 C). This possibility fits well with the wide variety of \nlithologies observed within the western part of the Itabaiana dome. \n\n5.6 - Conclusions \nBecause of the small amount of data, and the lack of seismic sections, \n\ngeophysical knowledge of the Itabaiana Dome Area is relatively poor. However, \ncomputer modelling of the gravity and aeromagnetic field data, and analysis of the \naeromagnetic and radiometric anomaly maps available in the literature (Motta 1990), \npermit the following conclusions to be drawn: \n\n143 \n\n\n\n1 - The geophysical cross sections generally support the relative depth of the \n\nbasement and metasediments used in the structural cross sections presented in Figures \n\n4.20 and 4.21. \n2 - The aeromagnetic and radiometric data allow a clear identification of the \n\nexposed areas of crystalline basement and the areas of sedimentary cover. \n3 - The aeromagnetic data provide good indications of the traces of the regional \n\nfaults and of shallowly buried slices of crystalline basement. They indicate the continuity \nof the Sim\u00e3o Dias gneiss to the east and west of the field area, and the slices of Itabaiana \ngneiss in the hangingwall of the Dores thrust in the northeastern comer of the field area. \n\n4 - The Sim\u00e3o Dias gneisses are most probably the outcropping expression, in \nthe area of study, of an E-W trending tectonic slice which stretches for more than \n100km. This slice was emplaced sub-vertically into highly deformed metasediments, \nalong and very close to the northeastern border of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\n5 - The crystalline basement is heterogeneous and may be sub-divided into \nblocks of different density and magnetic susceptibility, which probably reflect variable \nproportions of basic and acid compositions. \n\n6 - The upper crust in the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt may be \ninterpreted in terms of wedge-shaped blocks of metasediment and crystalline basement, \nwhich resemble tectonic slices separated by listric-like fault planes merging downwards \nin a subhorizontal detachment at a depth of 10 km. \n\n144 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Geological evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano \n\nFold Belt \n\n6.1 - Introduction \nThis chapter has four main objectives -\n\n1. To present an interpretation of the geological evolution of the Itabaiana Dome \n\nArea. \n\n2. To discuss the implications of the results of this research for the geological \n\nevolution of the whole of the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\n3. To develop a model for the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. \n\n4. To discuss the implications of this research in the analysis of the tectonic \n\nevolution of other Proterozoic fold belts, particularly those of the Pan-African and \n\nBrasiliano orogenic system. \n\nThe geological evolution of the Itabaiana Dome Area is summarised and \n\ndiscussed in section 6.2 and models for the basin development, sedimentation, and for \n\nthe structural and metamorphic evolution are proposed. The evolution of the basement \n\ndomes is discussed. \n\nSection 6.3 discusses the significance of this research with respect to the \n\nevolution of the southern Sergipano Fold Belt and for the Sergipano Fold Belt as a \n\nwhole. A tectonic model is proposed. \n\nSection 6.4 compares the geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt with that of other \n\nfold belts in the Pan-African-Brasiliano orogenic system, and the implications for \n\nProterozoic crustal evolution are also discussed. \n\n6.2 - Geological evolution of the Itabaiana Dome Area \n\n6.2.1 - Introduction \nFigure 6.1 is a lithostructural summary map of the Itabaiana Dome Area. Figure \n\n6.2 is a simple domain map depicting the main lithotectonic regions of the Itabaiana \n\nDome Area. The cratonic domain in the south consists of little to non deformed and non \n\nmetamorphosed sediments (including the Lagarto Group). \n\nThe WNW-ESE striking Itaporanga fault separates this domain in the south from \n\nthe highly deformed, greenschist facies siliciclastic and carbonate metasediments (with \n\nminor metavolcanics) and the Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias gneiss dome complexes of the \n\nfold-thrust domain (Fig. 6.2). The SSW-NNE striking Propria fault separates the \n\nProterozoic sequences from the Mesozoic Sergipe-Alagoas basin (Fig. 6.2). \n\nThe Itabaiana Dome Area has undergone polyphase contractional deformation, \n\nascribed to the Brasiliano Orogeny, with a peak of metamorphism at 673-600 Ma (Brito \n\nNeves &amp; Cordani 1973; Gava et al. 1983). The dominant structures are large, southwest \n\nvergent recumbent Fj folds, SW vergent F2 folds and associated high angle thnist faults \n\ntogether with two basement gneiss domes mantled by metasediments (Fig. 6.1). \n\n145 \n\n\n\n38\u00b0 00' W \n\nI\nOlhos D'agua Fm: \nmetacarbonates, \n(metacarbonates \nand metapelites) \n\nIPalestina Fm: diamictites and pebbly phyllites \nD \n\nD \nFrei Paulo Fm: \n\nvariegated and silty \nphyllites \n\nF P 1 - calcite-cement \nmetasandstones, phyllites, \nminor metacarbonates \n\nF P 3 - quartz-sencite phyllites, \ninterbedded black phyllites \nand shales, metasiltites, \ncalcilutites and greywackes \n\nJacar\u00e9 Fm: \nmetasiltites \n\nLagarto-Palmares Fm: \nfine to medium grained \nsandstones and wackes \n\nJacoca Fm : \nmetarbonates, \n(metacarbonates \nand metapelites) \n\n\u2022\n\nR i b e i r \u00f3 p o l i s F m : \nphyllites, pebbly \nphyllites, metavolcanics \n\nI t a b a i a n a F m : \n\nUquartzites (conglomerate metasandstones and phy \nCrystalline basemer \ngneiss-granitic complex \n\nPA = Paripiranga anticline, JF = Jacar\u00e9 fault, IF = Itaporanga fault, SDF = Sim\u00e3o Dias fault, EF = Es \nPF = Pelada fault, VBF = Vaza Barris fault, MF = Mocambo fault, MS = Mocambo shear, RF = Ribe \nDF = Dores fault. \n\nI 4 6 \n\n\n\n3 7 \u00b0 1 0 ' W \n10\u00b030'S \n\n10\u00b040'S \n\n- m : \n\u00abes, \nonates \n\u2022elites) \n\nolis Fm: \n\u2022ebbly \nnetavolcanics \n\naFm: \n(conglomerates), \nstones and phyllites ~~ \n\nne basement: \nnitic complex \n\ni fault, EF = Escarpa fault, \n\u00edar, RF = Ribeir\u00f3polis fault, \n\nSo, Sn \n\nF1 overturned \nsyncline \n\nF2 anticline \n\nStrike-slip fault \n\nS2 foliation \n\nF1 overturned \nanticline \n\nThrust fault \n\nInverted \nextensional fault \n\n10\u00b050'S \n\n- > - B2, L2 \n\n\u00c0 A F2 overturned \n\\J anticline \n\nM Normal fault \n\n25 Macambira \nr i \u00bb i phyllonites \n\nFigure 6.1 - Summary lithostructural map of the \nItabaiana dome area.

Major strike-slip faults arc the Vaza Barris fault and the Mocambo \n\nshear (Figs. 6.1 &amp; 6.2). \n\nThe basement gneiss domes are fault-bounded on their northern and southern \n\nmargins. The basement gneiss mctascdiment cover contact is generally sheared and \n\nsubvertical. The basal unconformity is found undeformed at the eastern margin of the \n\nItabaiana dome (Fig. 6.1). The western margin of the Itabaiana dome has a basement-\n\ndenved phyllonttic zone parallel to and also and along part of the basal unconformity \n\n(Fig. 6.1). Extensional shear bands in this zone consistently indicate a top down to the \n\nWNW movement (section 3.3.2). \n\n6.2.2 - Stratigraphy of the Itabaiana Dome Area \n\nThe Itabaiana Dome Area mapped during the course of this research includes \n\nboth the cratonic domain (undeformed or little deformed sediments) and the south \n\nvergent fold/thrust terrane (Fig. 6.2). A new stratigraphy has been established for the \n\narea (Chapter 3) based upon detailed mapping, structural analysis and the application of \n\nsequence stratigraphic principles (e.g. Hubbard et a]. 1985 a; Wagoner et al. 1987). \n\nThis new stratigraphy (summarised in Fig. 6.3) shows that strata deposited \n\nessentially on the craton consist of the Est\u00e2ncia and Lagarto Groups whereas strata \n\ndeposited within the basin (probably best described here as a miogeocline) consist of the \n\nMiaba, Lagarto and Vaza Barris Groups (Fig. 6.3). Thicknesses on the craton total \n\napproximately 1 km whereas in the basin thicknesses total approximately 4 km. \n\nThe age of sedimentation is generally inferred to be Mid to Late Proterozoic \n\n(1000-900 Ma) based upon lithostratigraphic correlations with the Bambui Group (Cloud \n\n&amp; Dardenne 1973; Misi 1976). Detailed stratigraphic relationships and the scdimentology \n\nof the units are described in Chapter 3. These data, combined with stratigraphic and \n\nsedimentological descriptions in other research in lhe sou\u00fciern part of the Sergipano Fold \n\nBelt, has allowed new stratigraphic interpretations to be made (Fig. 6.3). \n\n1. The Juet\u00ea Formation correlates with the Itabaiana Formation: both \n\nunconformably overlie the crystalline basement and are overlain by carbonates. \n\nMoreover the meta-arkosic sandstones and red-brown phyllites of the Itabaiana \n\nFormation may be correlated with similar lithologies in the Juet\u00ea Formation of Suva \n\nFilho et al. (1978 a &amp; b) and Saes (1984). \n\n2. The Acau\u00e3 Formation may be correlated with the Jacoca Formation - both are \n\ncarbonates and both are overlain by the Lagarto Group. \n\n3. The Lagarto Group includes the Lagarto-Palmares, Jacar\u00e9 and Frei Pajlo \n\nFormations, which are overlain by the Palestina Diamictites - a distinct unit in the basin. \n\nDespite the intense polyphase deformation that has obscured thickness changes \n\nand also perhaps original unconformity surfaces, the structural and stratigraphic analysis \n\nof this research has enabled to recognise four megasequences (Hubbard et al. 1985 a &amp; \n\nb) that divide the sedimentary evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt \n\nin two distinct cycles, each one characterised by a lower siliciclastic megasequence and \n\nan upper carbonate megasequence (Fig. 6.3). \n\n148 \n\n\n\nCRATON BASIN \n\nCYCLE \n\n1 \n\nII \n\nMEGASEQUENCE \n\nUPPER \nCARBONATE \n\nUPPER \nSILICICLASTIC \n\nLOWER \nCARBONATE \n\nLOWER \nSILICICLASTIC \n\nGROUP \n\nLAGARTO \n\nEST\u00c2NCIA \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco craton \n\nFORMATION \n\n>v OLHOS D'AGUA \n\n\\ PALESTINA \n\n~ ~ > ~ ~ > \n\nLAGARTO \" - V J JACAR\u00c9 \"~~~ F R E I \nPALMARES e \"\n\n J A O A K t\n &lt;r > PAULO \n\nACAU\u00c3 - r - - _ .

Cycle II has a lower siliciclastic megasequence consisting of \nthe Lagarto and Palestina sequences overlain by the Olhos D'agua upper carbonate \nmegasequence (Fig. 6.3). \n\nIt is important to note that each carbonate megasequence exhibits shallowing \nupwards facies (Section 3.4) and overlies different siliciclastic units and, in places, the \nbasement. The Acau\u00e3 carbonates are either in sharp contact with the Juet\u00ea siliciclastics or \nwith the crystalline basement in the cratonic domain (Silva Filho et ai. 1978 a &amp;b; Saes \n1984). In the Itabaiana Dome Area, the Jacoca carbonates are in sharp contact with the \nRibeir\u00f3polis conglomerates and with Itabaiana quartzites, in the Capit\u00e3o farm area (e.g. \nFig. 3.11 B &amp; outcrop 312). \n\n6.2.3 - Depositions! environments, facies and \nthickness distributions \n\nSiliciclastic sedimentation \n\nCycle I The basal cross-bedded Itabaiana quartzites that unconformably overlie \nthe basement may be interpreted to have been deposited in a shallow marine environment \n(cf. interpretations by Walker 1985a) whereas the interbedded arkosic metasandstones \nand reddish brown phyllites of the Itabaiana Formation may be interpreted to indicate \nrejuvenation and uplift of hinterland areas of the crystalline basement (cf. Dickinson &amp; \nSuczek 1979). The overlying Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation pebbly phyllites probably indicate \nerosion of tectonically uplifted hinterland areas and deposition by mass flows (section \n3.4.4). The lower siliciclastic megasequence indicate a continental to shallow marine \nsedimentary environment with the clastic source area to the south, together with the \ndevelopment of a miogeocline to the north. Active extensional tectonics during \ndeposition were probably responsible for the mass flow deposits. \n\nCycle II The lower siliciclastic sequence is characterised by the northward \nprogradation and upward coarsening of the shallow marine sandstones, siltstones and \nmudstones of the Lagarto Group. Outboard miogeoclinal equivalents of the Lagarto-\nPalmares sandstones are the Jacar\u00e9 metasiltites and the Frei Paulo phyllites (Fig. 6.1). \nThis may be interpreted to indicate rejuvenation of the hinterland on the craton to the \nsouth either by a sea level fall or by tectonism (as compared to the relatively quiescent \nperiod during which the shallowing upwards sequence of the underlying carbonates was \ndeposited). The petrography of the Lagarto-Palmares sandstones indicates that they were \nderived from crystalline basement with additional detrital input from low grade \nmetasediments and metavolcanics (Table 3.1). The sandstone bodies in the Frei Paulo \nFormation to the north of the Vaza Barris trough suggests erosion of uplifted basement \nblocks to the north of the trough (section 3.7). \n\nISO \n\n\n\nCarbonate sedimentation \nFrom the detailed descriptions and map distribution of the lithofacies in the \n\nItabaiana Dome Area (section 3.4) it is apparent that both the Jacoca and Olhos D'agua \nFormations strongly suggest that the Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias domes were paleohighs \nduring the evolution of the miogeocline. Facies interpretations (section 3.4.5) indicate \nthat both are shallowing upward carbonate sequences. A period of relative quiescence \nmay be inferred during the deposition of the Jacoca and Olhos D'agua sequences, \nbecause of the lack of slumping, debris flows and turbidites, as found on carbonate \nplatforms that underwent syndepositional tectonism (e.g. Hcrrington &amp; Fairchild 1989; \nBechstadt &amp; Boni 1989). \n\nCycle I Jacoca carbonates. The Jacoca carbonates die out from the Itabaiana dome \ninto the area between the Pelada and Escarpa faults, and also to the north of the \nMocambo fault (Fig. 6.1). The base of the formation starts with what may be interpreted \nas offshore shelf facies (parallel-laminated and thinly intercalated carbonate and fine \nsiliciclastics, - distal turbidites), and passes upwards into subtidal-intertidal facies, with \noolites, intraclasts and wave-reworked structures indicating an agitated, near shore \nenvironment \n\nCycle II Olhos D'agua carbonates. The thick Olhos D'Agua carbonates around the \nSim\u00e3o Dias dome pass upwards into subtidal-intertidal facies, with oolites, intraclasts \nand wave-reworked structures also indicating a near shore environment, and pass into \nsiliciclastic-rich carbonate facies, across the Escarpa fault and Vaza Barris trough, up to \nthe north of the Mocambo fault (Fig. 6.1). \n\nThickness variations \nDespite the limitations imposed by the intense deformation, the estimates of \n\nstratigraphic thicknesses indicate that, apart from lhe Itabaiana quartzites (which are \ngenerally =10-50m thick and locally up to =700m in the vicinity of the Itabaiana dome), \nthe siliciclastics are significantly thinner (0-100m) near the basement domes than \nelsewhere in the map area. The greatest accumulations of siliciclastics (=500m) occur \nbetween the Escarpa and Pelada faults, in the so called Vaza Barris trough, as well as to \nthe north of the Mocambo fault (Fig. 6.1). \n\nThe Vaza Barris trough, which is also the depocentre for the Palestina \ndiamictites, also contains the most of the volcanics (and probable volcanoclastics) of the \nFrei Paulo Formation, whereas to the north of the Mocambo fault most of the \nRibeir\u00f3polis volcanism is found (Fig. 6.1). \n\nConsideration of the stratigraphic, sedimentological and thickness relationships \n\noutlined above (and given in detail in Chapter 3) permits an interpretation that Cycle 1 \n\nbegan with a shalLow marine deposition onto the basement (Itabaiana sandstones) \n\nfollowed by deepening of the basin and possible active tectonism (Ribeir\u00f3polis \n\nFormation), to progressive shallowing of the basin and the development of the Jacoca \n\n151 \n\n\n\ncarbonates (particularly flanking the paleohighs of the Itabaiana and the Sim\u00e3o Dias \n\ndomes). Cycle II indicates regeneration of the hinterland (probably through tectonism), \n\ndeposition of the Lagarto Group and the Palestina Formation probably in fault bounded \n\nbasins (e.g. the Vaza Barris trough) followed by a second shallowing upward carbonate \n\nsequence (the upper carbonate megasequence - Fig. 6.3) that infills the basin to the north \n\nof the Ituporanga fault. \n\nThe wide variety of lithofacies and their overall distribution and thickness \n\nvariations indicates deposition in an open platformal environment containing relatively \n\ndeep water environments in extensional fault bounded basins on the craton margin - i.e. \n\na miogeocline with the craton to the south. The fact that now most of these thickness and \n\nfacies variations are found across major thrust faults supports an interpretation that the \n\nthrust faults are inverted extensional faults. \n\nThese conclusions are supported by other researchers (Humphrey &amp; Allard \n\n1962, 1967, 1969; Silva Filho et ai. 1978 a &amp; b) who interpreted a shallow marine \n\nenvironment and a miogeocline sedimentation in the southern part of the Sergipano Fold \n\nBelt. In addition basins with well documented thickness variations together with lateral \n\nand venical superposition of shallow water and relatively deep-water facies and \n\ngeographically related to regional extensional faults, have been interpreted as examples \n\nof syn-extensional sedimentation (e.g. Mitchell &amp; Owens 1990; Trexler &amp; Nitchman \n\n1990; Collier 1991). \n\n6.2.4 - Basin evolution: a model for the Itabaiana Dome Area \n\nIn order to erect a model for the development of a sedimentary basin it is, in ideal \n\ncases, necessary to take into account the geometry of the basin, the stratal thicknesses \n\nthroughout the basin, age relationships, subsidence and thermal histories, compaction \n\neffects (Barr 1991), as well, as the nature of the faulting controlling basin development \n\n(i.e. mode of extensional faulting - simple shear versus pure shear). \n\nThe model of basin evolution for the Itabaiana Dome Area (Figs. 6.4 &amp; 6.5) has \n\nbeen based on the evidence (5:1 to 20:1 thickness variations; facies variations) for a \n\ntectonically controlled sedimentation up to the deposition of the third megasequence. \n\nThe model assumes a simple shear style, linked lisrric detachment architecture \n\n(cf. Wernicke &amp; Burchfiel 1982; Wernicke 1985; Gibbs 1984, 1987) in which the \n\nsouthern part of the Sergipano Basin is interpreted as a half graben developed upon a \n\nlistric basal detachment, with a ramp-flat geometry, together with a system of synthetic \n\nand antithetic, planar and listric normal faults that accommodate the cumulative strain of \n\nthe extending hangingwall. The Vaza Barris trough is interpreted as a major, long lived, \n\nramp syncline or crestai collapse graben. Two major periods of extension are postulated \n\ncorresponding to the development of the two siliciclastic megasequences, followed by \n\nperiods of relative tectonic quiescence and deposition of the carbonate megasequences. \n\nDespite the increasing debate concerning extensional systems of listric versus \n\nplanar faults (Kusznir et al. 1991), recent seismic investigations across the Rhine \n\ngraben, between Germany and France (Brun et al. 1991), has resulted for example in a \n\nhalf graben interpretation similar to that proposed here. \n\n152 \n\n\n\nItabaiana quartzites in \ntheir deepest depocenter, \nthe site of the future \nItabaiana dome \n\nDeposition of the \nRibeir\u00f3polis coarse \nsiliciclastics and \nemplacement of \nthe volcanics \n\n40km \n\nSim\u00e3o Dias \nhigh \n\nItabaiana incipient \nhigh Vaza Barris \n\ntrough \n\n1km \n\nDeposition of \nthe Jacoca \ncarbonates \n\n50km \n\nEst\u00e2ncia - Miaba Group \n\nFormation Lithofacies \n\nIF = Itaporanga fault \nSDF = Sim\u00e3o Dias fault, EF = Escarpa fault \nPF = Pelada fault, MF => Mocambo fault \n\nAcau\u00e3-Jacoca \nlimestones, \ndolomites F3 interbedded limestones, siltites. line sandstones and pelites \n\nRibeir\u00f3polis \n\nJuet\u00e9-ltabaiana \n\npelites, pebbly pelites \nand volcanics \n\nfeldspathic arenites, \nand interbedded \narkosic sandstones \nand mudstones \n\nCrystalline \nbasement \n\nI 1 amphibohte lacies \nj + .+ gneisses and \n1 ' orthogneisses S&lt;\n\n I brittlely reworked basement \n- * l during extension \n\nFigure 6.4 - Evolution of the basin and its sedimentary infill.

Ribcir\u00f3polis pebbly \nphyllites and also Palestina Formation diamictites adjacent to the Sim\u00e3o Dias and \nMocambo faults). These indicate uplift and erosion of footwall blocks (and possibly \nhangingwall blocks) at two periods during the evolution of the basin. \n\n4. The lack of multiple wedge shaped sedimentary sequences within the \nsuccession. These would be produced if extension on the basin margin dominantly \noccurred by an array of domino style faults. \n\nAlthough other fault styles have been proposed for extensional sedimentary \nbasins (e.g. domino-style faults Barr 1987; Davison 1989; and flexural cantilever models \n- Kusznir et al. 1991; Roberts &amp; Yielding 1991) a listric detachment style similar to that \nproposed for extending continental margins (e.g. Lister et al. 1986) or for the Rhine \nGraben (Brun et al. 1991) appear to be the most appropriate to explain the original \narchitecture of the southern part of the Sergipano Basin (keeping in mind the difficulties \n\nin determining thickness variations obscured by the strong tectonic overprint). \n\nThe Model \nThe model for the evolution of the Itabaiana Dome Area is depicted in Figures 6.4 for the \n\nfirst cycle and Figure 6.5 for the second major depositional cycle. \n\nCycle l Evolution of the lower siliciclastic megasequence. \nDeposition of the lower siliciclastic megasequence was synchronous with the \n\ndevelopment of extensional faulting on a listric detachment that dipped northwards at the \ncraton margin (Fig. 6.4 A), Shallow marine arkosic sandstones with intercalated \nmudstones of the Itabaiana Formation were deposited at this time. Active extensional \nfaulting is evidenced by local conglomerates and diamictites together with thickness \nvariations of 20:1 across the Itaporanga and Sim\u00e3o Dias faults. The sequence fines \nupwards into the Ribcir\u00f3polis Formation, with continued extension indicated by the \nRibcir\u00f3polis diamictites. \n\nThe Itabaiana dome and also probably the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome evolved as \npaleohighs (Fig. 6.4 B) at this time with the development of shallow water environments \nthat ultimately lead to the deposition of the Jacoca carbonates (first carbonate \nmegasequence). This extension probably caused progressive uplift of the Itabaiana \ndome, as part of a rollover anticline. The Mocambo fault is interpreted to have been \nactive at this stage (Fig. 6.3 B). \n\nThe model accounts for the local conglomeratic fades within the upper Itabaiana \n\nquartzites and in the lower Ribeir\u00f4polis Formation (western and eastern sides of the \n\n1 5 5 \n\n\n\nItabaiana dome - 150m of Jacarecica diamiciites (here in the Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation) \nwith 1.2m size clasts of basement, in the north-northeastern border of the Itabaiana dome \n(Humphrey &amp; Allard 1969), and accounts for the thinning of the Ribeir\u00f3polis Formation \ntowards the dome, together with the voluminous Ribeir\u00f3polis phyllitcs to the north of the \nMocambo fault, an area that also contain a significant amount of pebbly phyllitcs, \ndiamictites and volcanics. \n\nCycle I Lower carbonate megasequence. \n\nThis phase of extension was probably followed by a period of thermally driven \n\nsubsidence, leading to the development of the the Acau\u00e3 and Jacoca Formations around \n\nthe Itabaiana dome (Fig. 6.4 C). \n\nCycle II Evolution of the upper siliciclastic megasequence. \nThe second major sedimentary cycle records the onset of a second -phase of \n\nrifting that begins with the deposition of the Lagarto Group and records the greatest \nactivity during deposition of the Palestina diamictites (Fig. 6.5 A). The Vaza Barris \ntrough probably developed as a ramp syncline during this period and was the major \ndepocentre in the area. The Lagarto Group likely reflects the development of a \nprogradational delta system from the craton, to the south, onto the craton margins \n(section 3.7). \n\nCycle II Upper carbonate megasequence. \n\nA second phase of thermal subsidence is postulated to account for the \ndevelopment of the widespread carbonate platform of the Olhos D'agua sequence (Fig. \n6.5 B). This may be interpreted as a post-rift sequence that infills the basin and onlaps \nonto the craton margins. \n\nThe basin model outlined above shows many similarities to those proposed for \n\nother Proterozoic basins developed on craton margins elsewhere in the world. The Mid-\n\nto Late Proterozoic of the Purcell and Windermere Supergroups, in the western \n\nCordillera of North America, shows similar cycles of extensional fault controlled \n\nsedimentation passing upwards into shallowing upwards carbonate sequences (Pope \n\n1989). The Adelaidian of South Australia also shows a similar stratigraphic record \n\n(Preiss 1987). \n\n6.2.5 - S t r u c t u r a l a n d m e t a m o r p h i c evolution of the I t a b a i a n a \n\nDome Area \n\nS t r u c t u r a l evolution \n\nDetailed mapping and structural analysis has shown that the metasediments of the \n\nItabaiana Dome Area underwent three phases of ductile to ductile-brittle deformation \n\n(Chapter 4) during the Brasiliano orogeny. The dominant structures are southwest \n\nvergent recumbent F; folds (probably nappes) and southwest vergent more upright F2 \n\n156 \n\n\n\nfolds and high angle thrust faults with oblique slip (Fig. 6.1). Dj structures are \n\ncrenulation and kink folds which are associated with sinistral movement along the major \n\nfault structures such as the Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itaporanga faults (Fig. 6.1). \n\nThe basement gneiss domes had undergone a history of high grade amphibolite \n\nfacies deformation and tnetamorphism (section 4.2.1) prior to the D( to D3 Brasiliano \n\ndeformations which are the focus of this study. Di, D2 and D3 deformations affected \n\nboth the gneissic basement domes and their cover of metascdiments (section 4.9). \n\nDj t o D 3 deformations are interpreted as a progressive polyphase deformation as \n\nthe Sergipano Basin underwent contraction with tectonic transport onto the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco Craton, from NNE to SSW. A summary of the structural elements is given in \n\nFigure 6.6 and a detailed structural synopsis is given in Chapter 4. \n\nD, Deformation \n\nDl is interpreted as a progressive event of SSW directed layer-parallel shearing and \n\nshortening, responsible for the pervasive subhorizontal S, foliation, shearing of the \n\nbasement-cover contact, and development of rootless intrafolial F | folds, and for the \n\noutcrop scale low-angle thrusting (Fig. 6.6). The best exposure of D j structures is in the \n\nCapit\u00e3o farm outcrop (Fig. 4.24) - additional evidence comes from outside the Itabaiana \n\nDome Area (e.g. Santos et al. 1988; Jardim de S\u00e1 et ai. 1986). Map-scale stratigraphic \n\nrepetitions are interpreted as F[ recumbent folds, probably nappes (Fig. 6.1). \n\n\u00a3>2 Deformation \n\nDj deformation records a progressive NNE to SSW shortening by nearly upright folding \n\nand high-angle south vergent thrusting. Penetrative S2 foliations are developed together \n\nwith an L2 lineation and stretching fabric parallel to the strike of the orogen (section 4.9). \n\nThe regional faults appear to be zones of high strain concentration. Deformed clasts \n\nwithin the Palestina Formation indicate a prolate finite strain ellipsoid (section 4.4.4), \n\nwhich together with syn-D2 deformed veins (section 4.4.5) are indicative of orogen \n\nparallel extension - a common feature observed in many contractional/collisional orogens \n\nand probably indicative of a transpressive tectonic regime with a component of orogen-\n\nparallel strike-slip movement (e.g. Ellis &amp; Watkinson 1987). \n\nBecause D2 probably occurred under various degrees of shortening with top to \n\nthe south shearing along strike, the F2 folds may be expected to have curved hinges on a \n\nregional scale and thus may account for the double plunge of L2 in the Itabaiana Dome \n\nArea (section 4.4.1). The Itaporanga fault is interpreted to be the sole thrust or basal \n\ndetachment for this phase of deformation (Figs. 4.22 A &amp; B). \n\nO j Deformation \n\nD3 is a non penetrative kinking, crenulation folding and strike-slip event that is \n\ninterpreted to be a consequence of the strike-slip movement along the major faults \n\n(section 4.9). A differential degree of slip along the pre-existing S surfaces (e.g. S 2 , S ( , \n\nSQ and S n) during Dj may account for the fan of L3 directions throughout the map area \n\n(section 4.5 &amp; Fig. 4.17). \n\n15 7 \n\n\n\nEVENT STRUCTURES \nSUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE MOST \nRELEVANT STRUCTURAL FEATURES \n\n^ o ' an \n.

The origins of basement gneiss domes \n\nwithin orogenic belts have been the subject of considerable debate (Hanks &amp; Wallace \n\n1990). Models for their evolution include - domes produced by fold interference (e.g. \n\nRamsay 1967), diapirism (e.g. Ramberg 1981; Coward 1981b; Brun 1983; Windley \n\n1984), basement cored fold nappes (e.g. Holdsworth 1989; Davis et al. 1991; Brown et \n\nal. 1991) or as basement cored anticlines (Murphy 1990). In some instances the \n\npresence of extensional shear zones along the margins of the gneiss complexes has lead \n\nto their interpretation as metamorphic core complexes produced by extensional \n\nexhumation and thinning of the contractional orogen (e.g. Coney &amp; Harms 1984; Davis \n\n&amp; Lister 1988; Lister &amp; Davis 1989; Malavieille &amp; Taboada 1991). \n\nIn the Itabaiana Dome Area the metamorphic grade and the presence of both D | \n\nand D2 structural elements in the gneisses (Chapter 4) implies that they are involved in \n\nthe thrusting and that the basal detachment for the contractional deformation was \n\ntherefore within the gneisses. The distribution of sediments together with facics and \n\nthickness changes around the gneiss domes (see section 6.2.3 above) indicates that they \n\nevolved as paleohighs during sedimentation. The extensional fault model proposed for \n\nbasin formation (Figs. 6.4 &amp; 6.5) can therefore also account for the structural position of \n\nthe gneiss domes in the fold belt as the result of contractional reactivation of extensional \n\nfaults bounding basement fault slices. \n\nThe contact relationships between the gneiss domes and their metasedimentary \n\ncover, however, warrant further discussion. As described in section 3.3.2, the gneiss \n\ndomes exhibit both unconformity and sheared contacts with the metasedimentary cover. \n\nIn particular the wes:ern flank of the Itabaiana dome contains the prominent Macambira \n\nphyllonites which indicate a top down to the west extensional event (section 3.3.2). \n\nHumphrey &amp; Allard (1969) interpreted the phyllonites as an older deformation of \n\nthe crystalline basement, and that the extensional fabrics were possibly related to the \n\nBrasiliano age evolution of the dome. Although their conclusion was based upon the \n\napparently discordant trends of the phyllonites with respect to the basal unconformity, \n\nand upon folds and extensional fabrics affecting both the phyllonites and Itabaiana \n\nquartzites (section 3.3.2), they did not present conclusive evidence that the Macambira \n\nphyllonites are older than the basal unconformity (this was confirmed in a written \n\ncommunication with Professor Gilles Allard in 1992). \n\nThe phyllonites are considered here a s y n - D 2 extensional structure (to date no \n\nphyllonite clasts have not been described in the cover metasediments) and have been \n\naffected by F2 folds together with the extensional fabrics and Itabaiana quartzites, as \n\nresult of a progressive deformation. \n\nFigure 6.7 summarises in a diagrammatic way the evolution of the Itabaiana \n\ndome. A combination of differential uplift of the dome, folding and thrusting during D2 \n\ndeformation and a syn-D2 transpression E-W trending squeezing out of the ductile \n\nbasement, offers a feasible explanation for the progressive development of a ductile \n\nshear zone sub-parallel to the basal unconformity in the western side of the dome (the \n\n1 5 9 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.7 - (A-E) Evolution of the Itabaiana dome. The Itabaiana \nquartzites are shown in dark grey. All the scales are approximate. \n\nI60 \n\n\n\nMacambira phyllonites), and for the progressive top down to the west movement \n\nresponsible for the extensional shear bands affecting the phyllonites. During late D2 \ndeformation the dome probably underwent bulk rotation bounded by the major fault \n\nzones (Fig. 6.7 E). The rotation accounts for the particular NNW-SSE orientation of S2 \nand L2 in the eastern and western structural domains (section 4.6.4 &amp; Fig. 4.2) which \n\nis not satisfactorily explained by simple stress refraction around a relatively rigid gneiss \n\ndome. \n\nThe Sim\u00e3o Dias dome probably evolved as a series of basement slices bounded \n\nby listric extensional faults (Figs. 6.5 D &amp; E), which were subsequently folded and \n\nuplifted during the positive inversion. \n\nMetamorphic evolution \nThe mineral assemblages and textural relationships (section 4.8) in the Itabaiana \n\nDome Area indicate that the Brasiliano deformation and metamorphism occurred under \n\ngreenschist facies conditions. The basement gneisses appear to have been retrogressed \n\nfrom amphibolite facies and now display amphibole-epidote-chlorite assemblages. The \n\nmetasediments generally display greenschist facies assemblages with the development of \n\nchlorite in suitable lithologies. \n\nThe carbonates and siliciclastics of the Itabaiana Dome Area do not lend \n\nthemselves to detailed PTt studies (of. England &amp; Thompson 1984; Thompson &amp; \n\nEngland 1984) at greenschist facies and in particular because of the lack of age \n\ndeterminations in this area. In addition there is a distinct lack of porphyroblast \n\ndevelopment necessary for such studies in polydeformed terranes (Vernon 1989). \n\nMetamorphic conditions appear to range from sub-greenschist facies in the \n\ncratonic domain to greenschist facies in the metasediments and greenschist facies \n\nretrogression in the basement gneisses (section 4.8 &amp; Fig. 6.6).

The first part of the discussion is focused upon \n\nstratigraphic and structural correlations between the Itabaiana Dome Area and the Carira \n\narea to the north. \n\nFigure 6.8 is a geological map of the Itabaiana-Carira area, east of the 38 \u00b0W \n\nmeridian and between the southern and northern parts of the Sergipano Fold Belt. The \n\ntwo parts of the belt are separated by the S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo and Dores faults. The \n\n161 \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n3\n\n \n\n\n\nCloser to this dome, the carbonate layers of the Jacoca Formation to the north of \n\nthe Mocambo fault are normally 10-100cm thick, and the siliciclastic fraction consists of \n\nmeta-argillites, variegated phyllites and dark grey to black phyllites, with subordinate \n\nlayers of metasiltites and fine grained mctasandstones (section 3.3.3). Far from the \n\nItabaiana Dome Area, Santos et al. (1988) described the continuation of the Jacoca \n\ncarbonates (their Pfpr2 lithofacies) as interbedded metasiltites, fine-grained sandstones, \n\ntogether with&lt;10cm-thick layers of metacarbonale and marls. They also described \n\nparallel stratifications and small-scale wavy-reworked structures, and interpreted this \n\nlithofacies as proximal rhythmites. \n\nThis feature can be associated with sandy input from the north-northwest of the \n\nVaza Barris trough, since before the deposition of the Frei Paulo Formation (it is \n\naccepted that carbonate sedimentation dies with increasing siliciclastic supply - Sellwood \n\n1986; Hanselman et al. 1974; Grotzinger 1989). \n\n3. The Ribciropolis Formation mapped to the north of the Itabaiana dome \n\n(section 3.3.4) now encompasses the pebbly phyllites, phyllites, metagreywackes, \n\ndiamictites and me.ravolcanics which were mapped by Santos et al. (1988) to the south of \n\nthe S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo fault (Fig. 6.8), and interpreted as part of the Capit\u00e3o-Palestina \n\nFormation. Their position relative to the structure is also in agreement with this revised \n\ncorrelation. \n\n4. The lenses of quanzite mapped as the Capit\u00e3o-Palestina Formation by Santos \n\net al. (1988) are here interpreted to be part of the Itabaiana Formation (Fig. 6.8) as these \n\nunits are laterally continuous with the Itabaiana Formation mapped in the Redonda and \n\nCampina ranges (Fig. 3.1). In the hangingwall of the Dores fault lenses of Itabaiana \n\nquartzites have been emplaced riding on slices of basement derived phyllonites thus \n\nlending additional weight to this correlation. \n\n6.3.3 - Structure of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt \nThe structural cross-sections across the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt \n\n(Fig. 6.9) were constructed using the same style as that for the sections through the \n\nItabaiana Dome Area (Figs. 4.20 &amp; 4.21). The fold pattern of large-scale F1 folds co-\n\naxially refolded by F2 folds form a classical type 3 interference pattern (Ramsay 1967), \n\ndisrupted and uplifted by high-angle thrust faults. \n\nThe three recumbent F1 folds in the Itabaiana Dome Area (Figs. 6.8 &amp; 6.9 A) \n\naccount for the stratigraphic repetition of the Frei Paulo Formation to the west of the \n\nSim\u00e3o Dias dome (section 3.3.3). These folds have 30km of amplitude and may be \n\nnappes associated with subhorizontal thrusts - as those described elsewhere in the \n\nsouthern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1986; Brito Neves et al. \n\n1987; Campos Neto &amp; Brito Neves 1987). \n\n6.3.4 - Structural and lithostratigraphic interpretations \n\nThe structural interpretation above is consistent with the small scale structures \n\nobserved in the Capit\u00e3o farm outcrop (Fig. 4.24) and the F1 fold which repeats the \n\nstratigraphy to the west of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome agrees with the strong layer-parallel S1 \n\n164 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.9 - (A-B) Schematic structural cross sections acr \ndomains.

Although no \n\nstructural field evidence has been found as yet for the two F, folds to the north of the \n\nPelada fault (Fig. 6.8) such an interpretation combines the stratigraphic repetition to the \n\nwest of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome with the lithostratigraphic interpretations to the north of the \n\nMocambo fault, as illustrated in Figure 6,10. \n\nThe concept is that the F1 recumbent folds (possibly associated with low-angle \n\nthrusts, as they appear in the Capit\u00e3o farm outcrop, Fig. 4.24) nucleated in the northern \n\npart of lhe area, near the future Mocambo thrust (Figs. 6.10 A &amp; B). The thick Olhos \n\nD'\u00e1gua carbonates may have acted as a barrier to the southward tectonic transport during \n\nD1, and were folded along all of the northern border of the Vaza Barris trough, which \n\nwas possibly an important structural discontinuity during basin inversion. \n\nAs a consequence of this recumbent folding and/or thrusting, the Frei Paulo \n\nsandy phyllites of the northern part of the Vaza Barris trough were thinned and \n\ndisrupted, being displaced from their northern position toward the western side of the \n\nSim\u00e3o Dias dome. \n\nDuring the D2 deformation (Fig. 6.10 C), the subhorizontal F1 overthickened \n\nhinges in the Jacoca and Olhos D'\u00e1gua Formations to the north of the trough, possibly \n\nalso acted as barriers to the deformation, and were progressively rotated to subvertical \n\npositions. With the progressive shortening, the already thinned Frei Paulo phyllites were \n\ncompressed within the two carbonate hinges, and probably acted as the detachment level \n\nfor the Mocambo thrust. \n\n6.3.5 - Lithostructural continuity in the Sergipano Fold Belt \nThis research presents strong evidence for lithological and subdural correlation \n\nbetween the southern and northern pans of the Sergipano Fold Belt, across the Dores \n\nand S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo faults (Fig. 6.8). \n\nThe lithological evidence is provided by the Itabaiana quartzites and slices of \n\nbasement in the hangingwall of the Dores thrust fault (Fig. 6.8) and by their geophysical \n\ncontinuity with the Itabaiana gneisses (domain A, Fig. 5.3). In fact, as the Macurur\u00e9 \n\nGroup consists of quartzites (and mantled gneissic domes), mylonitic quartzites, \n\nmetacarbonates, phyllites, metasillites. metagreywackes, biotite- and staurolite-gamet \n\nschists, chlorite-quartz schists, and intermediary metavolcanics (Silva Filho et al. 1978 a \n\n&amp; b; Santos et al. 1988). it compares well with the Miaba and part of the Lagarto Group \n\n(if the latter were metamorphosed at higher grade and intruded by granites). \n\nThis is supported by the fact that the interpretations in the structural cross \n\nsections of the southern part of the belt (AB and EF, Figs. 6.8 &amp; 6.9) can be extended \n\nacross the S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo and Dores faults (ABB' and EFF'). The depth of the \n\nbasement in the hangingwall of the S\u00e3o Miguel do Aleixo fault (Fig. 6.9 A) is supported \n\nby geophysical data (section ZZ'Z\", Fig. 5.8). The depth of the crystalline basement in \n\nthe hangingwall of the Dores fault (Fig. 6.9 B) is supported by field and geophysical \n\ndata (sections 4.4.4 &amp; 5.3). \n\nIf the F1 recumbent folds interpreted for the Itabaiana Dome Area (Figs. 6.9 A &amp; \n\nB) are in continuity with the F, nappe structures described elsewhere in the Macurur\u00e9 \n\n167 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.10 (A-C) - Structural and stratigraphic interpretations. A is a diagramatjc representation of ttie formations in the vicinity \nof the Vaza Barris trough, between the Escarpa (EF), Pelada (PF) and Mocambo (MF) faults. B is a diagramatic representation \nof the Fi folds and low-angle thrusts emplaced above the trough (continued). \n\n168\n \n\n\n\nFigure 6.10 - C - Detail of the structural cross section ABB' of Figure 6.8 A, to show the \nrelationships between the Mocambo fault and the interpreted hinge zones of the F1 folds. \n\n169 \n\n\n\nDomain (Figs. 2.6 A, B, D &amp; E), the core of the F, folds currently outcropping in the \n\nMacurur\u00e9 Domain must consist of Miaba- and Lagarto Group-equivalent metasediments, \n\nlending support to the lithological continuity discussed above. Thus, the F1 structures \n\nacross the domain boundary would form a 10km-thick pile of folded and thrust \n\nmetasediments above the granites of the Macurur\u00e9 Domain (Fig. 6.9 A), which is in \n\naccordance with the interpreted depth of granite intrusion (Giuliani &amp; Santos 1988). \n\n6.3.6 - Tectonic evolution of lhe Sergipano Fold Belt \n\nThe results of this research combined with data from the literature permit the \n\ndevelopment of a model for the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. Such a \n\nmodel must account for the basin development (e.g. section 6.2.4 above), the structural \n\ndevelopment of the fold belt and to relate this to the regional tectonics of the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco Craton. \n\nTectonic Domains \nThree tectonic domains have been recognised in the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. \n\n6.11). From south to north these are - the Est\u00e2ncia Domain (cratonic), the Miaba /Vaza \n\nBarris Domain (southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt - miogeocline) , and the \n\nMacurur\u00e9 Domain (northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt - the eugeocline and the \n\nhinterland of the orogen). The occurrence of mantled basement gneiss domes and \n\nbasement derived migmatites in these domains (Fig. 6.11) indicates that the original \n\nsediments were deposited upon extended continental basement of the S\u00e3o Francisco \n\nCraton, which is also supported by geophysical data (Santos et al. 1988; Motta 1990), \n\nand is accepted in most of the literature of the area (Davison &amp; Santos 1989). \n\nHowever, the fault-bounded Canind\u00e9, Po\u00e7o Redondo and Maranc\u00f3 Domains \n\n(Santos et al. 1988; Davison &amp; Santos 1989) located to the north of the Macurur\u00e9 \n\nDomain (Fig. 6.11), can be associated with the evolution of a small oceanic basin, as \nwill be discussed in section 6.4, therefore a collisional suture between the S\u00e3o Francisco \n\nCraton and the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif is inferred to the south of the Canind\u00e9 \n\ncomplex (Fig. 6.11). \n\nThe mafic and ulrramafic Canind\u00e9 complex (Silva Filho 1976) is a 8km thick \nsequence consisting of mctabasites, meta-arkoses, quartzites, marbles and graphite \nphyllites, overlain by a major gabbroic-pyroxenitc unit. The complex is divided in four \nunits having mostly a geochemistry of island arc-type volcanism (Blais et al. 1989, \nBezerra et al. 1989,1990), but one particular unit has characteristics of intraplate basaltic \nmngmatism (Oliveira A Tarney 199(1). \n\nThe Maranc\u00f3 Domain comprises highly sheared, greenschist to amphibolite \n\nfacies, metarhyolites and mctadacites (80% of the surface), with minor meta-andesites, \n\namphibolitcs, metapelitcs, volcanic-derived conglomerates and arkosic/lithic quartzites, \n\nmetacarbonates, chloritites, and two concordant intrusive bodies of serpentinites. The \n\nPo\u00e7o Redondo Domain consists of orthogneisses and paragneisses migmatized and \n\ninjected by syn- and post-tectonic granites and granodiorites, and may represent \n\nreworked basement (Santos et al 1988; Davison &amp; Santos 1989). \n\n\n\nFigure 6.11 - Precambrian tectonic domains in the Sergipano Fold Belt. Just some granites of the Macurur\u00e9 Domain are shown. \n\n\n\nThrust bell and foreland basin models \nThe results of this research do not support the model of thrust belts and \n\nassociated foreland basins (Beaumont 1981) which have been proposed for the mobile \n\nbelt / fold belts around the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (e.g. Pimentel et al. 1992). Such a \n\nmodel had been proposed and accepted for the origin of the Palmares sandstones (section \n\n2.8 &amp; Fig. 2.9). \n\nThe principal argument against this model is that the sediments on the craton are \n\n900 Ma in age (Misi 1976) and are laterally continuous with the sediments that now \n\nform the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 6.3). These strata are therefore clearly older than the \n\nBrasiliano deformation, hence cannot have been deposited in a foreland basin setting as \n\ndeformation developed. \n\nMoreover, the sedimentary characteristics of the Lagarto-Palmares sandstones \n\n(section 3.3.4 &amp; Saes 1984) do not compare either with continental sedimentation \n\ndescribed elsewhere ahead of thrust sheets (e.g. Gustavson 1974; Hirst &amp; Nichols 1986; \n\nNichols 1987) or ahead fault uplifted terranes (e.g. Wescott 1990, Wescott &amp; Ethridge \n\n1990). Similarly, the stratigraphic succession formed by the Lagarto and Vaza Barris \n\nGroups (Fig. 6.3) does not compare with the marine sedimentation developed in \n\nforeland basins due to accretion of terranes into a passive margin, as interpreted for \n\nexample in the evolution of the Appalachians and Cordilleran basins of North America \n\n(Tankard 1986). \n\nTectonic model \n\nA tectonic model for the southern part of Sergipano Fold Belt is depicted in \n\nFigure 6.10. Figure 6.10 A shows the inferred architecture prior to D1 deformation \n\nwhereby the Vaza Barris trough was the locus of deposition of the Palestina diamictites \n\nin a basin bounded by the Escarpa and Pelada faults. D1 deformation was characterised \n\nby southward directed tectonic transport with the development of large recumbent fold \n\nnappes and possibly thrust out lower limbs (Fig. 6.10 B). The penetrative, flat-lying S1 \nfoliation in the metasediments was developed at this time. The recumbent folds (and \n\nthrusts?) probably evolved from the hinterland of the orogen, to the north of the \n\nMocambo fault. \n\nD2 deformation (Fig. 6.10 C) is interpreted to have been part of the same south \n\nvergent progressive deformation, resulting in bulk shortening of the section, penetrative \n\nS2 foliations and inversion of the original extensional faults, so that these thrusts link to \n\nthe lower detachment (e.g. Fig. 6.9). The model indicates that the shortening and \n\ninversion along the Mocambo fault in the region of the Vaza Barris trough was greater \n\nthan that in the vicinity of the Itabaiana dome (cf. sections in Fig. 6.9). \n\nThis interpretation is supported by the geophysical data (Figs. 5.6-5.8) which \n\nindicate that the crystalline basement increases in depth from west to east. Possibly \n\nbecause of the Itabaiana dome, the D2 shortening was more intense across the Vaza \n\nBarris trough (note the narrowing of the outcropping area of the Palestina Formation \n\nbetween the Pelada and Escarpa faults. Fig. 6.8) and in consequence, the diamictites \n\nwere possibly pushed out of the Vaza Barris trough Fig- 6.10 A). Such situation, which \n\n172 \n\n\n\nis expected in inverted crestai collapse grabens (McClay &amp; Buchanan 1991), matches \n\nwith the greater amount of inversion of the Mocambo fault in this area. \n\nStrain measurements together with textural and fabric studies indicate that D2 \ndeformation was characterised by a sinistral strike-slip, transpressive regime (section \n\n4.8). This oblique contractional deformation is interpreted to have been responsible for \n\nthe rotation of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 6.6) at this stage, with the basement dome acting \n\nas a resistant rigid object that deflected strain trajectories around it \n\nThe syn-D2 transpressive regime in the Itabaiana Dome Area reinforces the \n\ninterpretation that the Sergipano Fold Belt probably resulted from the accretion of \n\nterranes during an oblique collision (Davison 1987; Santos et al. 1988; Davison &amp; \n\nSantos 1989). Actually, oblique collision and the resultant transpressive tectonic regimes \n\nare a common feature during the accretion of allochthonous terranes to cratonic margins \n\n(Howell 1989). \n\nThe lack of foreland basin sediments on the craton or within the frontal part of \n\nthe Sergipano Fold Belt (i.e. clastic sediments derived from the fold belt rocks or in part \n\nfrom the craton (from the peripheral bulge) and undeformed by the Brasiliano orogeny) \n\nmay be either a function of the present day erosion level, or a foreland basin may not \n\nhave been developed at all. \n\nA tectonic model that does not necessitate the development of a significant \n\nforeland basin (Fig. 6.12) involves an accretionary wedge developed whereby the D 1 - D 2 \ndeformations built up a 10km-thick sequence on the attenuated cratonic margin (Fig. \n\n6.12 A) and the loading in the inner parts of the belt was accompanied by downwarping \n\nof the attenuated crust (Figs 6.12 B &amp; C), so that the accretionary wedge did not develop \n\nsignificant relief above sea level and the thrusts did not encroach onto the craton. \n\nA similar argument was proposed by Tankard (1986) who cited COCORP \n\ngeophysical data as evidence that a 14km-thick wedge when emplaced onto a 4-5km \n\ndeep attenuated continental margin, did not create relief above sea-level, and hence the \n\ncrust beneath the wedge must have been deflected downwards for approximately 10km. \n\nFold belts with low topographic elevation and little denudation can also be generated at \n\nplate boundaries where the rate of subduction exceeds the rate of overall convergence \n\n(Royden &amp; Burchfiel 1989), with the result that the pull-down compensates the uplift by \n\nthrusting, folding and magmatism. \n\nIn the model of Figures 6.12 B and C the border of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton \n\nprobably underwent p o s t - D | orpost-D2 extension (cf. similar processes proposed by \n\nHouseknecht 1986 and Bradley &amp; Kidd 1991). This may account for the Jacar\u00e9 \n\nextensional fault in the cratonic area to the south of the Itaporanga fault (Fig. 6.1) and for \n\nthe post-D| extension in the Capit\u00e3o farm outcrop (section 4.7). \n\nThus, a complex interplay between compressive and extensive stresses may have \n\noccurred simultaneously along some of the regional thrusts. Whereas post-contraction \n\nextension is a common feature in many orogens (Carl et al. 1991), extension \n\ncontemporaneous to compression is being an increasingly recognised paradox in the \n\nliterature of deformation belts (Waters 1991). \n\n173 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.12 - Cartoons to illustrate the progressive tectonic loading, the \nprobable flexural downwarping of the crust, and the lack of thrusting on the \nS\u00e3o Francisco craton. JF = Jacar\u00e9 fault, IF = Itaporanga fault, SMAF = S\u00e3o \nMiguel do Aleixo fault, BMJF = Belo Monte-Jeremoabo fault. \n\n174 \n\n\n\nThis can account for descriptions of normal and thrust character in different \nplaces along the trace of the Itaporanga fault (Brito Neves et al. 1977 a) and can explain \nthe isolated carbonate breccia in the southwestern corner of the study area (section \n4.4.2). The carbonate breccia may be the product of an extensional reactivation of the \nItaporanga fault between highly folded Olhos D'\u00e1gua carbonates and relatively \nundeformed Lagarto sandstones (Fig. 6.12 C). \n\nIf the model of Figure 6.12 is applicable, the lack of significant syn-tectonic \nerosion probably implies conservation of a thickened crustal pile (Fig. 6.12 C) probably \nfor longer time than that predicted in PTt studies in other metamorphic bells (e.g. \nEngland &amp; Richardson 1977; England &amp; Thompson 1984; Thompson &amp; England 1984; \nThompson &amp; Ridley 1987). This may cause differential rates of isotopic \nrehomogeneization of Sr at different parts of the belt, therefore the onset of the \ndeformation may be older than the metamorphic ages suggested by Rb-Sr systems. \n\nThe S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and the Sergipano Fold Belt \nIn order to fully understand the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt its \n\nrelationship to the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton must be examined. Figure 6.13 shows the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco Craton with the surrounding fold belts, the Borborcma Province and the \nPernambuco-Alagoas Massif. \n\nTo the west of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 6.13) the Riacho do Pontal Fold \nBelt evolved in the 2100-1800Ma Transamazonic cycle (Jardim de S\u00e1 1988; Jardim de \nS\u00e1 et al. 1988), and was reactivated in the Brasiliano cycle by the dcxtral Pernambuco \nShear Zone (Gomes 1990). Further west, the 700-500Ma old Rio Preto Fold Belt keeps \ncharacteristics of an entirely intracratonic belt, and its crystalline basement was mostly \nformed during the Transamazonic cycle (Egidio da Silva et al. 1989, 1990). \n\nThese data strongly suggest that the southwestern part of the Borborema \nProvince and the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton were a single block since the Early Proterozoic. \nPorada (1989) proposed a continental bridge across the northern part of the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco and Congo Cratons around 1100-l000Ma (Fig. 2.11 A). This feature may \nhave extended further to the north between Brazil and Africa, and may have been formed \nas long ago as 2000 Ma, on the basis of structural, lithological and radiometric continuity \nbetween the two continents (Hurley et al. 1967; Torquato &amp; Cordani 1981). \n\nSuch a single land mass, grouping part of the Borborema Province, the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco Craton and western Africa, is also in agreement with the long-lived \nProterozoic supercontinent proposed by Piper (1976, 1987) on the basis of \npaleomagnetic data. Moreover an Early Proterozoic connection is also suggested by the \npossible continuity of the granulitic rocks of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, the Pernambuco-\nAlagoas Massif and the Chailu massif of the Congo Craton (Brito Neves et al. 1977 a). \n\nAdditional support is given by the unique geochemical similarities of the Early \nProterozoic Caraiba and Serrote da Laje copper sulphide deposits (Lindenmayer 1980; \nD'el-Rey SUva 1985; D'el-Rey Silva et al. 1988; Horbach &amp; Marimon 1988) - hosted by \npyroxenites emplaced within high grade gneisses in the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and in the \nPernambuco-Alagoas Massif respectively (Horbach &amp; Marimon 1988). \n\n175 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.13 - Sketch map showing the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and regional \nstructural elements of the Brasiliano tectonic cycle used to interpret the \nevolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Basin. \n\n176 \n\n\n\nPre-Brasiliano extension of the margins of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton have been \ndescribed by Aikmin et al. (1990) in the Ara\u00e7uai Fold Belt, in the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero \narea and in the west and southern part of the Brasilia Fold Belt (Fig. 6.13). Thus, it can \nbe concluded that syn-extensional depositional processes, similar to those proposed in \nthis thesis for the Itabaiana Dome Area, have affected the margins of the S\u00e3o Francisco \nCraton during the Middle to Late Proterozoic. Such an evolution suggests that the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco Craton underwent uplift and circumferal extension at this time (Fig. 6.13) and \nin particular the Sergipano Fold Belt evolved as an intracratonic basin on its western \npart, between what are now the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and the craton. \n\nThe opening and closure of the Sergipano Basin \nA schematic model for the opening and closure of the Sergipano Basin is shown \n\nin Figure 6.14. This model incorporates the aspects of the geological evolution of the \nSergipano Fold Belt (section 6.2), and also the relationships between the fold belt and \nthe S\u00e3o Francisco Craton discussed above. Facies and thickness relationships (Chapter 3 \n&amp; section 6.2 above) indicate that the area in the vicinity of the Itabaiana dome was the \nlocus of the depoccntre in the southern part of the Sergipano Basin. \n\nThe few formations and their small thicknesses in the cratonic and pericratonic \nparts of the Sergipano Fold Belt, to the west of the Tucano Basin (Gava et al. 1983, \nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o Filho &amp; Sales 1988) and the passage from lkm of cratonic sediments to \n4km of pericratonic sediments in the area of this thesis, point out to the Itabaiana Dome \n\nArea as the deepest depocentre in the southern part of the Sergipano Basin. \n\nThese data indicate an asymmetric basin that deepens eastward and northward of \na hypothetic point in the western pan of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Fig. 6.14 A), \nreaching maximum depths in the northeast, where the eugeoclinal Macurur\u00e9 Group was \ndeposited. The data also suggest oblique extension (or a combination of extension along \ndirections subparallel to N-S and E-W) and migration of the depocenter towards the ENE \n(Fig. 6.13). The extensional fault activity appears to have propagated westwards from \nthe vicinity of the Itabaiana dome during the early Itabaiana Formation time, to the \nlocality of the Sim\u00e3o Dias dome, by the late Itabaiana Formation time. \n\nThe model for the opening of the Sergipano Basin combines uplift of the central \npan of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and oblique extensional delamination of its margins, \nalong a low-angle basal detachment (Fig. 6.14 A). The lowest position of the detachment \nis speculative: by analogy with other areas (e.g. the Rhine Graben, Brun et al. 1991) it \nmay have been within the upper-lower crust boundary, or alternatively the basal \ndetachment may have gone to the base of the continental crust, as proposed for the \nDamara Fold Belt (Henri et al. 1990). \n\nThe closure of the Sergipano Basin (Fig. 6.14 B) assumes the inversion along \nthe main extensional detachment, as a result of the collision between the southern pan of \nthe Borborema Province and the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. The inversion of the basin was \ninitially accomplished by a southward movement of trie Borborema Province into the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco Craton developing the first phase of recumbent folding and low-angle \nthrusting toward south. \n\n177 \n\n\n\n1\n7\n\n8 \n\nFigure 6.14 A-B - Model for opening and closure ot the Sergipano Basin. \nA - Oblique extensional regime between the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and the \nBorborema Province and opening of the asymmetric basin (continued). \n\n\n\nFigure 6.14 B - Cartoon illustrating the oblique \ncollison between the Pernambuco-Alagoas massif \n(PAM) and the S\u00e3o Francisco craton (SFC), \nfollowing movement of the massif against the \nBorborema Province (BP), along the dextral \nPernambuco Shear Zone. See text for details. \n\n1\n7\n\n9 \n\n\n\nBecause the Sergipano Basin was probably narrower, and the detachment was \nprobably shallower in the western part of the basin as opposed to its eastern part, basin \nsediments were thrust onto the western part of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton but did not \noccur further east (Fig. 6.14 B). \n\nIn order to accommodate the continued convergence (probably oblique), the \nPernambuco-Alagoas Massif started to move laterally toward the west, along the \nPernambuco Shear Zone, creating a sinistral transpressive regime at the northern margin \nof the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. This regime generated the asymmetric, SSW vergent F2 \nfolding and oblique slip thrust faults. High pore fluid pressures at this time facilitated the \nthrust emplacement (for example, as evidenced by the extensive quartz veining along the \nPelada fault - Fig. 3.1, enclosure). \n\nClimbing the inclined ramp (Fig. 6.14 B) the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif \npossibly underwent uplift between the Sergipano Fold Belt and the Borborema Province, \nas a consequence of the curve of the Pernambuco Shear Zone to the south, combined \nwith the resistance offered by the western margin of the craton. A slight change in the \ndirection of the compressive field between the western parts of the Pernambuco-Alagoas \nMassif and the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, combined with the tooth-shaped margin of the \nbasin (Fig. 6.14 A) can explain the dominant dextral strike-slip movement associated \nwith the regional faults, similarly as proposed by Moraes et ai. (1987). \n\nThe faults are postulated to flatten at depth and merge into a basal detachment \n(Fig. 6.14b). The northward verging thrusts and folds of the northernmost part of the \nSergipano Fold Belt are interpreted as a positive flower structure - a feature typical of \ntranspressive regimes (Odonne &amp; Vialon 1983; Christie-Blick &amp; Biddle 1985). Thus, the \nlegacy of the Brasiliano orogeny was a conjugate set of zones of crustal weakness in the \nSergipano Fold Belt. They seem to have played a critical role in controlling the Mesozoic \nrift system which cross-cuts the Sergipano Fold Belt (Milani &amp; Davison 1988). \n\n6.4 - Implications for Proterozoic crustal evolution \n\n6.4.1 - Introduction \nThe Sergipano Fold Belt can be described as a low to medium metamorphic \n\ngrade, basement-involved, ductile fold and thrust belt. It is interpreted to have evolved \nby the inversion of an extensional half-graben fault system upon a low-angle basal \ndetachment as a result of the oblique collision of the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif with \nthe S\u00e3o Francisco Craton during the 600 - 700Ma Brasiliano orogeny (Fig. 6.14). \n\nThe fold belt is characterised by south-vergent polyphase folding and thrusting \nwith an oblique slip component of deformation. Basement gneiss domes (Fig. 6.11) \nshow strong evidence of ductile reworking of the crystalline basement during the \nBrasiliano orogeny. \n\nIn the following sections the implications of this study for the understanding of \nProterozoic stratigraphy, tectonic evolution, craton-mobile belt evolution and Proterozoic \nplate tectonics are discussed. \n\n180 \n\n\n\n6.4.2 - Late Protero/.oic sequence stratigraphy \nFigure 6.15 highlights, in a pre-Mesozoic drift reconstruction of the South \n\nAmerican and African continents, the Late Proterozoic Bambui Group sediments \ndeposited in the center and margins of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, and the sediments \nequivalent to this group deposited in and around the Amazon, West African, Congo and \nKalahari Cratons (Misi 1976). \n\nFigure 6.16 is a summary geological map of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. It \nconsists of Archean and Early Proterozoic high grade granite-gneiss and granulitic \nterranes, greenstone belts and supra-crustal sequences. Between 1800-1400Ma ago, the \ncraton underwent intracratonic rifting, which resulted in the Espinha\u00e7o Fold Belt and \nsedimentary cover. The craton has also extensive Late Proterozoic sediments (the \nBambui Group and Maca\u00fabas supra-crustals) and a Phanerozoic cover, such as that in \nthe Tucano Basin (Teixeira &amp; Figueiredo 1991). \n\nThe Est\u00e2ncia-Miaba Group is comprised of the lower siliciclastic megasequence \n(the Juet\u00ea-Itabaiana/Ribeir\u00f3polis Formations) and the lower carbonate megasequence (the \nAcau\u00e3-Jacoca Formation), and record the first sedimentary cycle (Cycle I) in the \nsouthern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt \n\nTable 6.1 shows the part of the stratigraphy of the Sergipano Fold Belt and its \nequivalents - the Bambui Group around the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. It can be seen that \nthere are close correlations between the sequences in the Sergipano Fold Belt and strata \nin other fold belts around the craton. In the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, the \nBambui equivalent sediments have been divided into the Est\u00e2ncia-Miaba Group, and the \nLagarto Group (the Lagarto-Palmares Formation). Therefore the Bambui Group is here \ninformally renamed Bambui Supergroup (Table 6.1). \n\nThe Est\u00e2ncia-Miaba Group forms the lower siliciclastic megasequence and the \nlower carbonate megasequence of cycle I in the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 6.3). In other \nfold belts around the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Table 6.1) only the basal equivalents of the \nsiliciclastic megasequence of Cycle II of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 6.3) are found, \nand the overlying Palestina diamictites and Olhos D'Agua carbonates have no \nstratigraphic correlatives. \n\nThe elastics of the Bambui Group and in particular the diamictites reflect the \nuplift and erosion of the craton. In the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt the \ndiamictites contain clasts of gneiss, granite and quartz (Juet\u00ea Formation) and clasts of \ngneiss, granite, quartz and quartzites (Ribeir\u00f3polis diamictites). All the diamictite units in \nother fold belts around the craton have similar clast assemblages and in addition clasts of \ncarbonates, metasiltites, and metapelites (Karfunkell &amp; Hoppe 1988; Egidio da Silva et \nai. 1989). \n\nThese assemblages indicate erosion of the cratonic basement and also Middle \nProterozoic sediments (e.g. Rio Preto, Ara\u00e7uai, and Brasilia Fold Belts). The Juet\u00ea \ndiamictites therefore reflect the erosion of the basement, in an area where Middle \nProterozoic sediments are not recorded (Fig. 6.16). The Ribeir\u00f3polis diamictites reflect \nthe erosion of both the basement and Itabaiana quartzites. \n\n181 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.15 - Pre-drift reconstruction of the South American \nand African continents, showing the Pan-African-Brasiliano \ncratons and fold belts, and the cratonic-pericratonic \nsedimentation equivalent to the Bambui Group deposited in \nand around the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\n182 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.16 - Simplified geological map of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, \nshowing the mains lithotectonic units (Modified from Teixeira &amp; Figueiredo \n1991).

Brasilia and Ara\u00e7uai Fold Belts, and in the Len\u00e7\u00f3is Basin. \n\n184 \n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that the carbonate megasequence (Acau\u00e3 equivalent) of the \nBambui Group in all these belts is overlain by a coarsening-upward siliciclastic sequence \nequivalent to the Lagarto-Palmares Formation (Table 6.1). These siliciclastic sequences \nhave similar petrographic characteristics (Saes 1984; Egidio da Silva et al. 1989; Uhlein \net al. 1990), and may indicate progressively greater uplift in the centre of the craton \n(Figs. 6.13 &amp; 6.16) by the time of the deposition of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation. \n\nThis discussion indicates that with more detailed stratigraphic and \nsedimentological analyses of the other fold belts surrounding the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \nmay be possible to reconstruct the erosional history of the craton and hence to investigate \nin more detail the hypothesis of uplift and circumferal extension proposed here. \n\nPalestina Diamictites \nThe Palestina diamictites and the overlying Olhos D'Agua carbonates are \n\nimportant stratigraphic units of the Sergipano Fold Belt and can be closely matched with \nthe stratigraphy of the West Congo and Damara Fold Belts (Table 6.2). The similarities \nin sedimcntology and sequence stratigraphy of these belts implies a strong pre-Brasiliano \nlinkage. \n\nIn particular the correlation of the Palestina diamictites with a major period of \nextension matches with similar interpretation for the Chuos diamictites of the Damara \nFold Belt (Table 6.2) which have been interpreted as the record of continental break-up \nand opening of the Khomas Sea between the Congo and Kalahari Cratons (Fig. 6.17; \nHenri et al. 1990). The Pan-African South Atlantic ocean (Fig. 6.17) has been postulated \nin order to explain the incompleteness of the West Congo Fold Belt (another rift should \nhave existed to the west but is now probably hidden by the Atlantic ocean). This \nprobably existed 1100 to 750Ma ago, between the southern S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and \nthe Congo Craton, but did not entirely separate the two continents (Porada 1989). \n\nTherefore the Sergipano Basin may have evolved into a small, E-W trending \nocean (here termed the Canind\u00e9 sea) in the northeastern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt at \nthis time. This hypothesis does not conflict with the concept of a Proterozoic \nsupercontinent (Piper 1987) as the amount of craton separation would have been too \nsmall to be delected by paleomagnetic methods (Briden 1976; Shackleton 1986). \n\n6.4.3 - Late Proterozoic tectonic evolution \nThe Sergipano Fold Belt is characterised by ductile reworking of the crystalline \n\nbasement and by south-southwest vergent folding and and thrusting, with some north \nvergent folds and thrust in the Macurure Domain (Fig. 6.14 B). \n\nDuctile reworking of crystalline basement is common in many other fold belts, \nsuch as the Early Proterozoic Aravalli of India (Nalia &amp; Mohanty 1989), the Grenville \nFront of Canada (Brown et al. 1991), the Late Proterozoic Tusas Mountains, USA \n(Williams 1991), and the Caledonian Fold-Thrust Belt of NW Scotland (Holdsworth \n1989, 1990). \n\nThe internal structure of the Sergipano Fold Belt also compares well with other \nfold belts where progressive shortening by folding and thrusting has led to steepening of \n\n185 \n\n\n\nTable 6.2 - Comparative stratigraphies of the Sergipano, West Congo and Damara Fold Belts.The Vaza Barris Group overlies the \nLagarto Group (this study), and has no correspondent in the other belts surrounding the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (see table 6.1). \n\n186 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.17 - Late Proterozoic diamictites deposited around and in the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco, Congo and Kalahari Cratons (Pre-drift reconstruction based on Fig. \n2.12 A). The Phanerozoic sediments are not represented in this figure. \n\n187 \n\n\n\nthe thrusts together with locking-up of the system and transpressional deformation. A \n\nsimilar tectonic history has been interpreted for the Areachap Group of South Africa \n\n(Donker 1990.) and for the southeastern Australian Fold Belt (Wang &amp; White 1990). The \n\nD1-D2 shortening of 75% across the fold belt (calculated in Fig. 6.9 A by line-length \n\nbalance along bedding in the Olhos D'\u00c1gua carbonates between the ltaporanga fault and \n\npoint B) is comparable with other similar orogens that have resulted from collision (e.g. \n\nDaly 1986; Gray et al. 1991). \n\nThe tectonic characteristics of the Sergipano Fold Belt are very similar to those \n\ndescribed for other Proterozoic fold belts in Brazil (Hasui &amp; Costa 1990; Corsini et al. \n\n1991), including those surrounding the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (e.g. Campos Neto &amp; \n\nFigueiredo 1990; Egidio da Silva et al. 1990; Gomes 1990; Schrank et al. 1990; Soares \n\nei al. 1990). The tectonic model of an inverted extensional half-graben (section 6.3 \n\nabove) also agrees with similar models evoked to explain the sedimentary and structural \n\nasymmetry in Pan-African-Brasiliano fold belts and related basins (e.g. Henry et al. \n\n1990; Krebs et al. 1990), \n\nThe majority of these fold belts have ductilely reworked crystalline basement, a \n\nhigh grade metamorphic axial zone, a double vergence of folds and thrusts both towards \n\nthe foreland and towards the hinterland, and transpressive or strike-slip related \n\ndeformation, as in the Damara Fold Belt (Henri et al. 1990) \n\n6.4.4 - Craton - Mobile Belt evolution \nThe deposition of Late Proterozoic coarsening upwards siliciclastic sequences on \n\ntop of the carbonates of the Bambui Group and equivalents indicate a radial dispersal \n\npattern outwards from a central high within the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Fig. 6.16). This \n\npattern may be interpreted to indicate domal uplift in the central part of the craton during \n\nthe period of extensional tectonics that formed the precursor basins that surround the \n\ncraton (Fig. 6.13). \n\nThe sedimentary basins which later formed the fold belts, appear to have been \n\ngenerated by circumferal extension at the margins of the updomed S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\nUplift of cratons, extension with onset of rift systems and continental break-up are being \n\nincreasingly associated with the rising of mantle plumes in the asthenosphere (e.g. White \n\n&amp; Mackenzie 1989; Kent 1991; Thompson &amp; Gibson 1991). It can be postulated that the \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco Craton and its ring of marginal basins could be part of a long-lived, large-\n\nscale core complex-like evolution, which may have started following the Archean to \n\nEarly Proterozoic periods of craton assembly. \n\nThe Middle-Late Proterozoic circumferal extension may be the end product of the \n\nuplift of the older mountain chains in the craton and exposure of their granulitic roots, \n\nsimilarly to the Basin and Range model of post-orogenie extension (Malavieille &amp; \n\nTaboada 1991). This hypothesis agrees with predictions that the exposure of g r a n u l e s \n\nin Archean-Early Proterozoic terranes has probably required a faster denudation than just \n\nerosion could provide (Thompson &amp; England 1984). The presence of voluminous \n\ngranites in these terranes suggest deep crustai igneous activity increasing the heat supply \n\nand provoking uplift and erosion (Thompson &amp; Ridley 1987). The Brasiliano-age \n\n88 \n\n\n\ngranites intruding the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Mascarenhas et al. 1984) may also be \n\nevidence of a deep seated heat source. \n\nAccording to this model, the sedimentary cycle I of the Sergipano Fold Belt is \n\nassociated with a progressive uplift of the centre of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and initial \n\nextension of its margins. In cycle II, the upper siliciclastic megasequence is associated \n\nwith a progressively faster uplift of the centre of the craton coupled with a major rifting \n\nevent in the basin, attributable to the unloading of the centre of the craton and opening of \n\nthe Canind\u00e9 sea. The upper carbonate megasequence records the post-rift sedimentation \n\nin the basin. \n\nThe applicability of this model to the other Pan-African-Brasiliano cratons and \n\nbelts (Fig. 6.15) is strongly supported by the similarities of the tectonic evolution of the \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco and Congo Cratons (Teixeira &amp; Figueiredo 1991) and by the \n\ncorrespondence between the Bambui Group with the craton-belt Late Proterozoic \n\nsediments deposited around the Amazon, West African, Congo, and Kalahary Cratons \n\n(Misi 1976). \n\nThe closure of the basins which are now (together with basement slices and \n\ngneiss domes) incorporated into the Brasiliano age fold belts that surround the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco Craton, is generally accepted to have occurred by collisional tectonics (Couto \n\n1984; Davison &amp; Santos 1989; Jones 1989). In the case of the Sergipano Fold Belt \n\ncollision between the Borborema Block - Pernambuco Alagoas Massif to the north and \n\nthe S\u00e3o Francisco Craton to the south is believed to have generated the fold belt (section \n\n6.3 above). \n\nThe models which have been invoked for the other fold belts that surround the \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco Craton assume the closure of intracratonic basins (Egidio da Silva et al. \n\n1990), or episodes of A-subduction (Campos Neto et al. 1990; Heilbron 1990) or even \n\nthe closure of small oceanic basins by collision of continental fragments or island arcs \n\nagainst the craton (Soares et al. 1990; Brito Neves &amp; Cordani 1991). \n\nIn the cases of intracratonic basins, closure may have simply involved the return \n\nof extended continental crust to more normal thicknesses whereas in the case of small \n\noceans subduction of oceanic lithosphere would have occurred. In the latter case \n\nidentification of oceanic crustal rocks, high P / Low T metamorphism and melanges \n\nwould be needed to identify paleosuture zones. \n\nThe characteristics of the Sergipano Fold Belt, such as the double vergence of \n\nfolds and thrusts, an axial zone with intermediate pressure and temperature \n\nmetamorphism, the slightly higher metamorphic pressures in its northernmost parts \n\n(Jardim de S\u00e1 et al. 1981), and the inferred suture along the line of the Canind\u00e9 Complex \n\n(Fig. 6.11), are comparable with the Damara and North Equatorial Fold Belts, where the \n\nclosure of small oceans and suture zones have also been interpreted (Henri et al. 1990; \n\nKukla &amp; Stanistreet 1991; Nzenti et al. 1988). \n\nThe probable characteristics of the Sergipano Basin (Fig. 6.14 A) and the unique \n\ncombination of the Palestina diamictites with the Canind\u00e9, Maranc\u00f3 and Po\u00e7o Redondo \n\nDomains implies that in, the Sergipano Fold Belt, the asymmetric basin passed along its \n\naxis from an western intracratonic setting into an eastern oceanic setting (Fig. 6.18). \n\n189 \n\n\n\nFigure 6.18 - Cartoon illustrating the opening of the Canind\u00e9 sea, and its \nrelationship with an asymmetric, continental crust-floored basin on its western end. \n\n190 \n\n\n\nThe consumption of the Canind\u00e9 sea in the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano \n\nFold Belt (Table 6.3) can explain the island arc signature and the emplacement of the \n\nmajor units of the Canind\u00e9 complex, by subduction of oceanic crust underneath oceanic \n\ncrust, and by collage of this arc onto the passive margin of the Pernambuco-Alagoas \n\nMassif. In a later stage, another arc (the Maranc\u00f3 Domain) possibly resulted from \n\nnorthward subduction of oceanic crust underneath the northern passive margin (Table \n\n6.3) or under deforming continental crust. Hall (1987) and Wilson (1989) point out that \n\nalthough andesitic suites result from subduction of oceanic crust under continental or \n\noceanic crusts, dacitic and rhyolitic suites (such as the Maranc\u00f3 Domain) are more \n\ncommon in the former than in the latter situation. \n\nBoth the Maranc\u00f3 and Po\u00e7o Redondo Domains may have been emplaced at the \n\nbeginning of the collisional stage (sensu of Shackleton 1986) and this may also explain \n\nthe position of the Po\u00e7o Redondo Domain within the Canind\u00e9 and Maranc\u00f3 Domains in \n\nthe map (Fig. 6.11). However, as Davison &amp; Santos (1989) pointed out, the late stage \n\ntranscurrent movement may have erased most of the evidence of movements other than \n\nlhe F-W sinistral shear, along the boundary between these domains. \n\nThe calcalkalinc-alkaline granites intruded in the northern part of the Sergipano \n\nFold Belt are co-genetic and can be explained by partial melting of the lower crust and \n\nupper mantle (Giuliani &amp; Santos 1988). However, as the granodiorites of Coronel Jo\u00e3o \n\nS\u00e1 and most of the major bodies (Fig. 6.11) are late- to p o s t - D 2 deformation (Santos el \n\nal. 1988; Davison &amp; Santos 1989) they cannot have been pan of pre-collisional arcs, as \n\npostulated by Fujimori (1989). Because the position of these granites within the \n\nMacurur\u00e9 Domain requires a southward subduction of oceanic crust underneath the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco Craton, of which there is no evidence, a simple model of partial melting of a \n\ntectonically-thickened and garnet-rich lower crust (Table 6.3) is preferred here. \n\nAlthough the tectonic evolution outlined above adds weight to the concept that the \n\nCanind\u00e9, Maranc\u00f3 and Po\u00e7o Redondo Domains might be allocthonous (Davison &amp; \n\nSantos 1989), the definite acceptance of such a terrane model requires detailed \n\npaleomagnetic and age studies of the three domains relative to the rest of the Sergipano \n\nFold Belt. \n\n6.4.5 - Implications for Proterozoic orogens and Plate T e c t o n i c \n\nThe stratigraphic connections between the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, Sergipano Fold \n\nBelt and the Congo and Kalahari Cratons are illustrated in Figure 6.17, Tables 6.1 and \n\n6.2. In particular the outcrops of the diamicutes of these areas are highlighted. \n\nIn the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, diamictites occur in the cratonic \n\nJuet\u00ea Formation (Saes 1984), in the Ribeir\u00f3polis and Palestina Formations (Tables 6.1 &amp; \n\n6.2). Around the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, diamictites have been described in the basal \n\nsection of the Bambui Group (Table 6.1 &amp; Fig. 6.17); in the Canabravinha Formation of \n\nthe Rio Preto Fold Belt (Egidio da Silva et al. 1989); in the Bebedouro Formation of the \n\nLen\u00e7\u00f3is Basin, in the Jequitai Formation of the Ara\u00e7uai Fold Belt, in the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o D'el-\n\nRey Group at the southernmost end of the craton, and in the Ibiii Formation (or Jequitai \n\nFormation) of the Brasilia Fold Belt (Kaifunkel &amp; Hoppe 1988). \n\n191 \n\n\n\nT a b l e 6.3 - S u m m a r y of t h e tectonic e v o l u t i o n of t h e S e r g i p a n o F o l d Belt. \n\n192 \n\n\n\nIn the West Congo and Damara Fold Belts (Fig. 6.17 &amp; Tabic 6.2) diamictites are \n\nfound in the Lower and Upper Tilloid Formations (Schermerhorn &amp; Stanton 1963; \n\nCoward 1981a; Schermerhorn 1981) and in the Chuos Formation (Henri et al. 1990) \n\nrespectively. The very similar stratigraphic relationships emphasised above therefore \n\nindicate similar tectonic histories of basin formation and extension. \n\nThere has been considerable debate as to whether the basins that are now \n\nincorporated into these Proterozoic fold belts were formed as intracratonic or oceanic \n\nbasins (Kroner 1983; Windley 1987). For example the Proterozoic fold belts of Australia \n\nare thought to be largely intracratonic in nature (Preiss 1987; White 1989). \n\nPorada (1989) and Brito Neves &amp; Cordani (1991) consider that, although many \n\nof the Pan-African-Brasiliano belts are intracratonic, some may have formed from \n\noceanic basins. Murphy &amp; Nance (1990, 1991) considered the Late Proterozoic fold \n\nbelts throughout the world as evidence of cnistal accretion and dispersal of a Proterozoic \n\nsupercontinent. They classified the belts into internal and external orogens. \n\nThe interior orogens (e.g. Pan-African-Brasiliano fold belts), were related to the \n\ndestruction of interior oceans and with supercontinent amalgamation. The external \n\norogens (e.g. Avalonian-Cadomian belt of North America and western Europe, and the \n\nArabian shield) were related to the destruction of wide oceans peripheral to the \n\nsupercontinent. Subduction probably started everywhere by SOOMa ago, but each of the \n\norogens evolved differently (Murphy &amp; Nance 1990, 1991). \n\nIn this model the internal belts culminated in continent-continent collision 650-\n\n600Ma ago, producing abundant calcalkaline magmatiSOT, crustal thickening, regional \n\nthrusting and nappe development, together with the erosion of the mountain chains and \n\ncratonic sedimentation (Murphy &amp; Nance 1991). At the margins of the supercontinent, \n\noblique subduction and closure of the wide oceans generated the peripheral fold belts, \n\nand produced widespread volcanism and synorogenic volcanoclastic sediments (=-600Ma \n\nago). \n\nIn the Proterozoic of South America, Brito Neves &amp; Cordani (1991) recognised \n\nboth marginal and 'internar fold belts. The marginal belts consist of probable passive \n\nmargin sedimentary and volcanic sequences thrust onto large continental blocks during \n\ncollisions) events. The internal orogenies (e.g. the northern part of the Sergipano Fold \n\nBelt) consist of flysch-type volcano-sedimentary wedges, and occur within smaller \n\nblocks, and also in branching fold belt systems. They probably originated as continental \n\nrifts, small oceans, or back-arc basins. \n\nIn order to account for the architecture of the fold belts around the S\u00e3o Francisco \n\nCraton Couto (1984) proposed a model of radial cnistal extension that separated the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco, Amazon, Paran\u00e1, Congo, West African and Kalahari Cratons (Fig. 2.11 B), \n\nfollowed by crustal shortening and convergence towards lhe S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\nThe Pan-African-Brasiliano fold belts probably represent the closure of a basin \n\nsystem established within the Proterozoic supercontinent, about 1100- lOOOMa ago and \n\nhaving an architecture very similar to the North Atlantic Mesozoic rift system (Fig. 6.19; \n\nPorada 1989). The evidence indicates that some of these basins were intracratonic \n\n193 \n\n\n\nJ\". \n\nFigure 6.19 - Comparative maps of the Mesozoic rifl system of North Atlantic (left) and the southern part of the \nPan-African-Brasiliano rift system (right). Note the cratonic fragments within both systems. From Porada (1989). \n\n\n\nFigure 6.20 - The Late Proterozoic major tectonic elements around the S\u00e0o \nFrancisco, Congo and Kalahari Cratons. \n\nI95 \n\n\n\n(Egidio da Silva et al. 1990; Uhlein et ai. 1990). but some may have evolved into \n\nnarrow internal oceans (e.g. this study; Henri et al. 1990; Soares et ai. 1990). \n\nThe above suggests that in the closure of asymmetric basins similar to the \n\nSergipano Basin (Fib. 6.18), subduction zones involving oceanic crust (B-subduction) \n\npasses axially into inverted extensional detachments of adjacent intracratonic basins, or \n\nalternatively into processes of A-subduction (Bally 1981). A modern analogue of this \n\npassage is postulated for the Tertiary evolution of the South China and Sulu seas \n\n(Howell 1989), whereas Shacklcton (1986) argues that A-subduction settings are \n\nprobably derivative from previous B-subduction processes. \n\nFigure 6.20 shows some Late Proterozoic tectonic features which resulted from \n\nthe closure of the original rift system. The combined result of many researches (see \n\nreferences in Fig. 6.20) is showing that the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton was probably \n\nsubducted underneath the Pernambueo-Alagoas Massif and Paran\u00e1 Craton, but overrides \n\nthe West Congo Craton, which in turn overrides the Kalahari Craton to the south (Fig. \n\n6.20). \n\nThis complex pattern of intracontinental deformation is further complicated if \n\nseveral smaller cratonic blocks which occur around the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (as in Fig. \n\n2 of Brito Neves &amp; Cordani 1991) are considered. For example, the recently \n\ncharacterised Transamazonic-age rigid block described to the southeast of the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco Craton (see 7, Fig. 6.20), could be either a continuation of the Angola Craton \n\n(Zimbres et al. 1990), or a continuation of the Rio de La Plata Craton. \n\nStrike-slip movements along the Transbrasiliano, Senador Pompeu, Pernambuco \n\nand Paraiba crustal-scale shear zones, and other smaller faults to the south of the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco Craton have further added to the tectonic complexity (Fig. 6.20). \n\nTaken together, all of these movements strongly suggest a pattern of \n\nintracontinental deformation accommodated by rotation of crustal blocks and the \n\ndevelopment of widespread mylonitic zones. Such movement patterns are expected to be \n\nwithin the limits of the Proterozoic paleomagnetic data (Briden 1976), and have been \n\nincorporated in a model of a fluid-chanellised Proterozoic mega-mylonitic crust (Katz \n\n1982). The connection of the Patos shear with the tectonic evolution of the Serid\u00f3 Fold \n\nBelt (Fig. 6.20; Corsini et al. 1991) is an example possibly similar to this process. \n\nThe polycyclic evolution of many of these Brazilian and African Late Proterozoic \n\nFold Belts (e.g. Ribeiro et al. 1990; Gomes 1990; Corsini et al. 1991) implies that these \n\ncyclic events occurred at essentially the same locations. Nance et al. (1988) postulated \n\nthat Proterozoic plate tectonics was governed by a regular cyclical process of continuous \n\ndisaggregation and amalgamation of a Proterozoic supercontinent along the same tectonic \n\nzones. \n\nThese authors consider heat as the primary engine of this process, and heat \n\ndiffusion through the continental crust as the key for its understanding. Cox (1991) \n\nsuggested a causal relationship between the upwelling of mantle plumes, continental \n\nbreak-up and the mechanisms which trigger subduction. If so, this process will have \n\nalso to account for other complexities of the system, such as the anomalous tectonic \n\ntransport of some fold belts, as the Rio Pardo (Fig. 6.19), the Australian Lachlan Fold \n\n1 9 6 \n\n\n\nBelt (Gray et al. 1991) and the Paraguai Fold Belt (Alvarenga 1990) of the eastern \nmargin of the Amazon Craton (see 8, Fig. 2.11 A). \n\nDavison &amp; Santos (1989) showed the difficulties in correlating mobile zones \nbetween Brazil and Africa (Fig. 6.20) because fold belts with very similar lithologies \nhave different directions of tectonic transport, such that found for the Sergipano and \nWest Congo Fold Belts (and Nadjol\u00e9 schists) which may be part of a triple junction near \nLibreville. They also proposed the correlation between the Rio Preto, Sergipano and \nNorth Equatorial Fold Belts (Fig. 6.20). The correlation with the latter fold belt is \nreinforced because it shows sedimentation continuous from the craton to the mobile, and \nhas a similar metamorphic zoning, although the axial zone contains granulitcs formed at \n\nT=750\u00b0-800\u00b0 and P=10-12kbar (Nzenti et al. 1988). \n\nOldow et al. (1991) argued that transcurrent and thrust faults merge into the basal \ndetachment, in virtually all fold belts, thus orogens float above subhorizontal zones of \nductile flow in the lower crust (or above upper mantle detachments). They pointed out \nvariations in the tectonic transport within an orogen may be due to relative motions of \nthrust sheets above the basal detachment. If so, different tectonic transport directions of \nProterozoic fold belts (Fig. 6.20) may be due to the practically simultaneous collision of \nseveral continental blocks. An understanding of such a process may rest on the role \nmande plumes (=heat) to govern the movement of fluids within the lithosphere. \n\nIf Late Proterozoic rifts and fold belts are governed by mantle plumes, triple and \ncuspate junctions of fold belts should be common and fold belts associated with different \ncratons will have similar stratigraphic and tectonic histories, as a result of the similarity \nof the processes that control basin formation and closure. Understanding the \nstratigraphic and tectonic evolution of Sergipano Fold Belt is a key to unravelling the \nProterozoic history of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and the Proterozoic supercontinent. \n\n197 \n\n\n\nChapter 7 - Conclusions \n\nThis chapter presents the conclusions of this PhD thesis together with \nrecommendations for further research in the Sergipano Fold Belt and S\u00e3o Francisco \nCraton, of northeastern Brazil. \n\n1. The Itabaiana Dome Area surrounds the Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias gneiss \ndomes, in the southern pan of the Sergipano Fold Belt. This is where basement-contact \nstratigraphic and structural relationships are best preserved in the Pan-African-Brasiliano \norogenic system in Brazil. \n\n2. A new stratigraphy has been erected for the southern part of the Sergipano \nFold Belt. Correlations can be made from the craton into the fold belt. Details of the \nstratigraphy are summarised below. \n\n3. The sedimentary record of the Itabaiana Dome Area and the southern part of \nthe Sergipano Fold Belt has been divided in two sedimentary cycles, each consisting of \ntwo megasequences. Cycle I consists of the laterally continuous Est\u00e2ncia and Miaba \nGroups. Cycle II consists of the Lagarto and Vaza Barris Groups. The sedimentation is \nprobably 1100-900Ma old. \n\n4. The 300m-thick Est\u00e2ncia Group is comprised of the Juet\u00ea and Acau\u00e3 \nFormations. The 1000m-thick Miaba Group consists of the Itabaiana, Ribeir\u00f3polis and \nJacoca Formations. \n\n5. The Est\u00e2ncia-Miaba Group consists of the Juet\u00ea-Itabaiana, Ribeir\u00f3polis and \nAcau\u00e3-Jacoca Formations. The Juet\u00ea-Itabaiana quartzites, mudstones, minor \nconglomerates and diamictites, together with the Ribeir\u00f3polis phyllites, pebbly phyllites, \ndiamictites and metavolcanics, form the siliciclastic megasequence of cycle I. The \nAcau\u00e3-Jacoca carbonates form the carbonate megasequence of cycle I. \n\n6. The 700m-3000m-fhick Lagarto Group was deposited both on the craton and \nin the basin and consists of the Lagarto-Palmares, Jacar\u00e9 and Frei Paulo Formations. \nThe basinal, 2000m-thick Vaza Barris Group comprises the Palestina and Olhos D'\u00e1gua \nFormations. The Lagarto Group siliciclastics and the Palestina diamictites and pebbly \nphyllites, form the siliciclastic megasequence of cycle II. The Olhos D'agua carbonates \nform the carbonate megasequence of cycle II. \n\n7. These miogeoclinal sediments record a continental to shallow marine \nsedimentation, with fault-bounded and localised deep-water basins (Vaza Barris trough). \nThe basins appear to have been controlled by syndepositional extensional faulting and \nuplift of cratonic blocks at their margins. \n\n198 \n\n\n\n8. The structure of the Itabaiana Dome Area is dominated by SW vergent \n\nrecumbent F1 folds which are coaxially refolded by SW vergent, upright to reclined F2 \n\nfolds and cut by steep, oblique-slip D2 thrust faults developed in a sinistral transpressive \n\ndeformation. Late stage, small scale F3 folds, kinks and the associated minor strike-slip \n\nfaults indicate orogen-parallel contraction and extension. These three ductile to ductile-\n\nbrittle deformational phases ( D 1 D 3 ) affected both the metasediments and the basement \n\ngneisses. \n\n9. D1 structures are a layer-parallel S1 foliation and generally rootless, southward \n\nverging, WNW-ESE trending and up to 35km wavelength recumbent F1 folds. These \n\nmay be associated with low-angle thrusts and are coaxially refolded by F2 folds. \n\n10. D2 structures are open to tight, gently inclined to upright, WNW-ESE \n\ntrending, and generally southerly verging F2 folds. These folds have a penetrative \n\npressure solution-type S2 axial planar foliation, and subhorizontal fold axes parallel to a \n\npenetrative stretching lineation. F2 folds are associated with WNW-ESE trending, \n\nsinistral oblique, steeply dipping faults, many of which are probably inverted extensional \n\nfaults. \n\n11. D3 structures are transversal, open to tight, generally upright, kink-style, \n\nsubhorizontal to subvertical folds, crenulations and kink bands. The F3 folds are \n\ngenerally associated with a steep-dipping, NE-SW trending, spaced cleavage. \n\n12. The Itaporanga fault separates the almost undeformed and unmetamorphosed \n\ncratonic domain to the south, from the deformed area consisting of the regional, Sim\u00e3o \n\nDias, Itabaiana, west and east structural domains. \n\n13. In the deformed area, the WNW-ESE trend of the S2 and L2 features in the \n\nregional, Sim\u00e3o Dias and Itabaiana structural domains change to NNW-SSE trend in the \n\nwest and east domains, respectively to the west and east of the Itabaiana dome. F2 folds \n\nare generally more open in the Itabaiana, west and east structural domains, than in the \n\nregional and Sim\u00e3o Dias domains. \n\n14. Deformation is attributed to a polyphase, progressive monocyclic event of \n\nbasin inversion associated with sub-greenschist metamorphism and tectonic transport of \n\nthe metasedimentary wedge of the southern part of the Sergipano Basin towards the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco Craton. \n\n15. D1 records layer-parallel shearing and N-S shortening, with duplication of \n\nthe stratigraphy. D2 records ENE-SSW shortening together with upward and E-W, out-\n\nof-section movements in a transpressive tectonic regime. The D 1 -D 2 total shortening is \n\nestimated at around 7 5 % . D3 records a minor and late-stage event of orogen-parallel \n\nshortening and extension. \n\n1 9 9 \n\n\n\n16. The Itabaiana and Sim\u00e3o Dias gneiss domes were progressively developed \nby superposition of D1 and D2 deformations and occupy the core of overturned F2 \nfolds. \n\n17. The Itabaiana dome probably underwent a syn-D2, top down to the west \n\nextension, developing a phyllonitic zone sub-parallel to the basal unconformity in the \n\nwestern margin of the dome. It also probably underwent a late-D2 counterclockwise \n\nrotation of 25\u00b0 about a vertical axis. \n\n18. The thick Itabaiana quartzites which surround the Itabaiana dome probably \nacted as a barrier to D2 deformation. The quartzites of the eastern margin of the dome \nare affected by generally NW-SE trending and subvertical shear zones, whereas those in \nthe western margin are affected by open F2 folds. \n\n19. The Sergipano Fold Belt comprises three WNW-ESE trending, fault-\nseparated but probably lithologically and structurally continuous domains. These are \nfrom south to north - the cratonic Est\u00e2ncia Domain, the miogeoclinal Miaba/Vaza Barris \nDomain, and the eugeoclinal Macurur\u00e9 Domain. \n\n20. The evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt is interpreted to have resulted from \nthe inversion of a half graben above a low-angle detachment of a listric fault system \nwithin the continental crust. The original basin probably passed axially to a small \noceanic setting on its northeastern side. \n\n21. The architecture of the whole Sergipano Fold Belt can be interpreted as a \npositive flower structure formed by the oblique collision between the Borborema \nProvince and the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\n22. Thrust belt-foreland basin and post-orogenic sedimentation models do not \nexplain the cratonic sedimentation of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. A \nmodel combining tectonic loading with downwarpingof an attenuated cratonic margin is \nproposed in order to account for the lack of foreland basin in this part of the belt. \n\n23. The sequence stratigraphy of the Sergipano Fold Belt compares well with the \nsedimentary record of the other Brasiliano belts surrounding the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, \nand also with other Pan-African belts around the Congo and Kalahari Cratons of Africa. \n\n24. The evolution of the Middle-Late Proterozoic basins developed around the \nS\u00e3o Francisco Craton may have been the expression of the rise of a mantle plume \nunderneath the craton. This model may be extended to other Pan-African and Brasiliano \ncratons such as the Amazon, West African, Congo, and Kalahari Cratons. \n\n2 0 0 \n\n\n\n25. Proterozoic crustal processes of basin opening and closure may be related to \nthe evolution of mantle plumes. Proterozoic Plate Tectonics appears to have been \ngoverned by a cyclic process of supercontinent fragmentation and amalgamation along \nlong-lived lines of lithospheric weakness. \n\nSuggestions for further research in the Sergipano Fold Belt and the S\u00e3o Francisco \nCraton are as follows -\n\n27. Field and/or geochronological evidence is required for the age of the \nMacambira phyllonites in the Itabaiana Dome Area. Such data may support the core \ncomplex hypothesis for the extension of the margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\n28. Detailed studies of the basement-cover relationships around the Jirau do \nPonciano gneissic dome are recommended for definition of the tectonic transport during \nD1 deformation in the Macurur\u00e9 Domain. \n\n29. Detailed structural, metamorphic, paleomagnetic and age studies are \n\nrecommended for the understanding of the affinities and mode of emplacement of the \n\nCanind\u00e9, Maranc\u00f3 and Po\u00e7o Redondo Domains, as they may be suspect or \n\nallochthonous terranes. \n\n30. Isotopic studies of the U-Pb and/or K-Ar systems across the Sergipano Fold \nBelt and its southern and northern cratonic margins, are recommended in order to \nunderstand the post-tectonic uplift of different segments of the belt. \n\n3 1 . More detailed studies are required on the syndepositional and possible \nextensional control of the sedimentation and lithofacies variations in the cratonic-\npericratonic areas of the Rio Preto, Brasilia and Ara\u00e7uai Fold Belts, in order to \nreconstruct the Pre-Brasiliano vertical movements of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. \n\n32. An integrated tectono-stratigraphy is required for the marginal basins of the \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco Craton, in order to account for the stratigraphic evidence in the Sergipano \n\nFold Belt. This could be a guide for similar studies around other cratons of the Pan-\n\nAfrican-Brasiliano orogenic system. \n\n33. Detailed structural analysis is required in key areas of the S\u00e3o Francisco \n\nCraton, in order to look for evidence of post-orogenic extension in the Early Proterozoic \n\nfold belts in the craton. \n\n201 \n\n\n\nReferences \n\nAlkmin, F.

It includes a reduced geological map with \n\nlocation of the 12 stratigraphic section constructed around the Itabaiana and \n\nSim\u00e3o Dias domes (A1.1) and seven of these stratigraphic sections (A1.2-\n\nA1.8). \n\nAppendix A2 contains measurement of axis of clasts and clasts + tail \n\nfrom Palestina Formation rocks in outcrops and thin sections. These data \n\n(A2.1-A2.3) form the base for the strain analysis of section 4.4.4 . \n\nAppendix A3 contains observed and calculated gravity and \n\nmagnetometric data, as well as density data of rocks in the Itabaiana Dome \n\narea. These data (A3.1-A3.4) form the base for the geophysical \n\ninterpretations of section 5.5 . \n\n2 2 6 \n\n\n\n2\n2\n\n8\n \n\n\n\n2\n2\n\n9\n \n\n\n\n2\n3\n0\n \n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n1\n \n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n2\n \n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n3\n \n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n \n\n\n\n Outcrop 36. road Sim\u00e1o Dias - Pinh\u00e3o   \n Face XY   Face YZ  \n\nX (cm) Y (cm) X/Y Y (cm) Z (cm) Y /Z \n0.6 0.1 6.0 22.0 9.0 2.4 \n1.0 0.3 3.3 12.0 5.0 2.4 \n0.8 0.3 2.7 8.5 5.0 1.7 \n2.5 0.9 2.8 3.0 3.0 1.0 \n1.3 0.4 3.3 3.0 2.0 1.5 \n1.9 0.6 3.2 5.0 4.0 1.3 \n1,2 0.5 2.4 6.0 4.C 1.5 \n\n10.0 3.0 3.3 1.5 1.5 1.0 \n5.0 1.4 3.6 7.0 3.5 2.0 \n\n10.0 3.0 2.3 10.5 7.0 1.5 \n1.5 0.5 3.0 7.0 6.0 1.2 \n2.1 0.3 7.0 6.5 2.7 2.4 \n1.1 0.3 3.7 6.0 2.2 2.7 \n' -\u00b1 0.4 3.5 4.0 2.8 1.4 \n1.6 0.4 4.0 11.0 7.0 1.6 \n3.6 1 .6 2.3 3.0 2.5 1.2 \n2.6 0.4 6.5 - - - \n3.2 0.0 3.S - - - \n\n      \n\n Outcrop 90, road Paripiranga-Sim\u00e0o Dias   \n FaceXY   FaceYZ  \n\nX (cm) Y&lt;cm) X/Y Y (cm) Z (cm) Y/Z \n14.0 3.6 3.9 0./ 0.7 1.0 \n4.1 0.3 13.7 2.9 2.9 1.0 \n2.2 0.5 4.4 1.1 0.5 2.2 \n3.5 0.5 7.0 0.7 0.7 1.0 \n8.8 1.0 8.8 1.2 1.2 1.0 \n9.5 3.0 3.2 1.0 0.7 1.4 \n2.0 0,7 2.9 1.0 1.0 1.0 \n3.3 0.3 11.0 3.3 3.3 1.0 \n5.3 1.2 4.4 0.7 0.7 1.0 \n\n24.5 2.0 12.3 0.9 0.9 1.0 \n6.0 1 .8 3.3 1.6 1.4 1.1 \n2.7 0.5 5.4 1.2 0.8 1.5 \n\n   2.8 1.7 1.6 \n   2.3 2.3 1.0 \n   1.8 1.8 1.0 \n\n   1.0 0.4 2.5 \n   1.1 1.1 1.0 \n   1.5 1.2 1.3 \n\n- - - - - - \n\nA2.1 -     Length of the axis of clasts measured in surfaces nearly \nparallel to XY and YZ in Palestina diamictites.
