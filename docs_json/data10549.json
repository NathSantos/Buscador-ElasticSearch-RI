(1996), many planktonic organ-\nisms exhibit daily vertical migrations in response to the daily\noscillations of several environmental variables. The distribution\nof planktonic communities is influenced by the intermediate\ndisturbance hypothesis proposed by CONNELL (1978), that is, high\ndiversity is at intermediate levels of disturbance.\n\nThe intermediate disturbance hypothesis furnishes an\nexplanation for the fact that the majority of ecosystems are far\nfrom being at climax or dynamic equilibrium or in a stable\nstate, in accordance with the theory of ecological succession.\nThis holds true as long as for the majority, a period of time has\nelapsed sufficient for this to be attained. The structure of com-\nmunities that undergo intermediate perturbations, have their\ndevelopment, or autogenic succession, delayed, interrupted or\ndestroyed.

The aim of investigation was to study the model of vertical distribution in Lago Amap\u00e1, taking into\nconsideration the seasonality of its zooplanktonic composition. Lago Amap\u00e1 (10\u00ba2\u201936\u201dS and 67\u00ba50\u201924\u201dW) is\nlocated in the floodplain of the Rio Acre. Samplings were conducted at three different depths of the water\ncolumn, to study the vertical distribution of zooplankton populations and determine some physico-chemical\nand biological parameters of Lago Amap\u00e1. Weekly samples were taken with a Van Dorn sampler. The species\nshowed greater concentrations at the by means of water column. Thirty-eight zooplankton species were found\nin the samples represented by Rotifera (30), Cladocera (5) and Cyclopoida (3). The temperature of the water\ncolumn showed a tendency toward relatively high values (about 30\u00b0C) with little variation, consequently resulting\nin low viscosity. Based of Jaccard\u2018s index, it was seen that during the low-water phase, S1 and S3 of the three\nsampling stations studied, had greater similarity (C\n\nj\n = 0.7058) in the middle of the water column. Lago Amap\u00e1\n\nshowed characteristics in line with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis model, favoring colonization by\nopportunistic species such as rotifers.\nKEY WORDS.

O objetivo desta investiga\u00e7\u00e3o foi observar a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o vertical da comunidade do zoopl\u00e2ncton no\nLago Amap\u00e1 (10\u00ba2\u201936\u201dS e 67\u00ba50\u201924\u201dW), localizado na plan\u00edcie de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o do Rio Acre. Amostragens foram\nconduzidas em tr\u00eas diferentes profundidades da coluna da \u00e1gua, considerando aspectos sazonais do zoopl\u00e2ncton,\npar\u00e2metros f\u00edsicos, qu\u00edmicos e biol\u00f3gicos.

Disturbance is the main determinant of com-\nmunity structure, with the important element of time influ-\nencing the level of diversity that is established after the event.\nWhen it is frequent, it can become a requirement of the com-\nmunity it creates. It is this consistency of disturbance that is at\nthe core of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (CONNELL\n1978, REYNOLDS et al. 1993, HARPER 1978). Periodic flooding of\nabandoned meander lakes, common in aquatic ecosystems in\nAmazonia, are events that exemplify these perturbations that\ninfluence the zooplanktonic communities present.\n\nLimnologic studies, including those on vertical distribu-\ntion, are still scarce. Some existing interrelations between or-\nganisms and physico-chemical parameters, considering verti-\ncal distribution, have been studied by LEWIS &amp; WEIBEZAHN (1976),\nINFANTE (1980), and BINI et al. (2001). The existing differences in\nthe vertical distribution of zooplankton species are probably\ndetermined by an interaction among physical, chemical and\nbiological factors, such as predation and competition.\n\nSuch studies conducted in Brazil have examined mainly\nthe daily variation of the floodplain of the Rio Paran\u00e1 (PAES DA\nSILVA &amp; THOMAZ 1997). FISHER et al. (1983), in studies of Lago\nCalado in Central Amaz\u00f4nia found microcrustaceans in the\noxygenated layer, with no evident vertical migration.\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the patterns of\nvertical distribution, taking into consideration the seasonality\nof the composition of the zooplankton community, and some\nabiotic variables of Lago Amap\u00e1 and of the floodplain of Rio\nAcre in the morning, during the main phases of the hydro-\nlogic cycle.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nIn the areas of the Amazonia lowlands, the character of\nthe Andean rivers develop strong lateral incisions instead of\nshowing depth erosion, resulting in meandering. After pass-\ning their cones of coarse rubble, deposited when leaving the\nmountainous section of their courses, the rivers carry a bot-\ntom-load of sand which forms sandbanks, and their waters\nbecome turbid, because of their load of fine suspended par-\nticles. The meanders migrate down the rivers, old ones are cut\noff and transformed into oxbow lakes, and new ones are\nformed. The whole land adjacent to the rivers is in a constant\nand rapid process of dismantling and rebuilding, a process\nwhich can be observed on a time scale of a few decades (SIOLI\n1984).\n\nThe lake studied is environment situated in the Amazon\nBasin. Lago Amap\u00e1 is situated in the municipality of Rio Branco\nwith the geographic coordinates 10\u00b002\u201936\u201dS and 67\u00b050\u201924\u201dW\n(Fig. 1). It is an affluent of the Rio Acre, characterized accord-\ning to SIOLI (1984) as a whitewater river with turbid water, more\nor less ochre-colored water; this type of river is well regarded\nin the pre-Andean zone as southwestern. One of the main char-\n\nacteristics of the lakes studied is the fluctuation of the water\nlevel, which is distinguished by two phases: high water and\nlow water. They are directly influenced by the hydrologic re-\ngime of the Rio Acre, especially during high water periods. These\nlakes are abandoned meanders. The minimum and maximum\ndepths for Lago Amap\u00e1 are respectively 2.7 and 4.5 m.\n\nAccording to SALATI et al. (1978), the hydrologic complex,\nwhich is the Amazon basin, is formed by thousands of small\nrivers and has probably been in dynamic equilibrium, together\nwith the exuberant forest, for millennia. The lakes studied are\nsituated south of the equator, beyond parallel 65\u00b0W, and re-\nceive a minimum amount of precipitation in June/July (SIOLI\n1984). Lago Amap\u00e1 is a lake belonging to the hydrographic\nbasin of the Rio Acre, to which it is permanently linked, and\nthus considered a whitewater lake, according to SIOLI (1968).\nThe lakes are surrounded by forest, which is inundated during\nhigh water, and as a consequence, there is a great input of\norganic matter from the forest into the lake.\n\nFigure 1. Studied Area.\n\n\n\n171Vertical distribution of zooplankton in the water column of Lago Amap\u00e1...\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zoologia 21 (2): 169\u2013177, junho 2004\n\nThe data on the biotic and abiotic parameters were col-\nlected at the lake generally at weekly intervals (except in Octo-\nber), during two periods comprising the the low-water phase\n(dry season) between May 8, 1997 and October 30, 1997 and\nthe high-water phase (rainy season) between January 2, 1998\nand February 24, 1998. Three stations were selected: station I \u2013\na region located close to a canal that connects Lago Amap\u00e1\nwith Rio Acre; station II \u2013 an approximately central region of\nthe lake; station III; the terminal region of the lake.\n\nTo carry out a qualitative and quantitative analysis of\nthe zooplankton, 5-L aliquots were collected from each layer\n(top, middle and bottom) of the water column. The zooplank-\nton organisms were collected with a Van Dorn sampling bottle,\nusing a conical net (55-\u00b5m mesh) to filter 15 liters of water at\nthe different dephts.\n\nThe samples were preserved in a solution of 4% formal-\ndehyde. The determination of the physical, chemical and bio-\nlogical parameters, that is, water temperature (\u00b0C), transpar-\nency and depth of the water column (m), electrical conductiv-\nity (\u00b5S.cm-1), dissolved oxygen (mg.L-1) and chlorophyll-a\n(\u00b5g.L-1), was according to GOLTERMAN et al. (1978), and included\na modification of the assay for dissolved oxygen using sodium\nazide (GOLTERMAN et al. 1969). Alkalinity was determined by a\ntitrometric method according to MACKERETH et al. (1978).\n\nThe qualitative similarity between the populations of the\ndifferent collection locations was calculated using Jaccard\u2018s\nIndex (KREBS 1989) as follows: C\n\nj\n = a/a + b + c, where C is the\n\nindex, a is the number of species present in both locations, b is\nthe number of species present only in location A, and c is the\nnumber of species present only in location B. The presence of\na species in at a collection location was scored as 1, and its\nabsence was scored as 0.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nPhysical and chemical parameters and their influence on\nthe presence of zooplankton\n\nThe hydrometric levels obtained for the Rio Acre, in ac-\ncordance with the data furnished by the Civil Defense of the\nRio Branco Corp of Firemen for the period studied (low-water\nphase/1997 and high-water phase/1998), remained practically\nconstant up to almost the end of the low-water phase. How-\never, from October, it increased considerably up to the second\nhalf of February in the high-water phase.\n\nAs a result of the qualitative analysis of the zooplank-\nton, 30 taxa de rotifers, five taxa of cladocers and four taxa of\ncopepods were found. The species of Rotifera found were:\nAsplanchna brightwelli Gosse 1850; Asplanchna sieboldi (Leydig,\n1850); Brachionus calicyflorus Pallas, 1766; Brachionus calicyflorus\nanuraeformis (Brehm, 1903); Brachionus caudatus (Barrois &amp;\nDaday, 1884), Brachionus dolabratus Harring, 1915; Brachionus\nfalcatus (Zacharias, 1898); Brachionus havanaensis Rousselet,\n1911; Brachionus plicatilis (O.F. M\u00fcller, 1786), Keratella americana\n\n(Carlin, 1943); Keratella cochlearis Gosse, 1851; Keratella\ncochlearis hispida Lauterborn, 1900; Platyias quadricornis\n(Ehrenberg, 1834); Epiphanes macrourus (Barrois &amp; Daday, 1894);\nFilinia longiseta (Ehrenberg) 1834; Filinia opoliensis (Zacharias,\n1898); Filinia pjeleri (Hutchinson, 1964), Filinia terminalis Plate\n1886; Hexarthra intermedia brasiliensis (Hawer, 1953); Lepadella\novalis (O.F. M\u00fcller, 1786); Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943;\nTestudinella patina (Hermann, 1783); Trichocerca similis\n(Wierzejski, 1893); Trochosphaera aequatorialis Semper, 1872.\nThe cladocers were: Bosminopsis deitersi (Richard, 1895);\nCeriodaphnia cornuta SARS, 1886; Diaphanosoma spinulosum\nHerbst, 1975; Moina minuta Hansen, 1899; Moina reticulata\n(Daday, 1905); and copepod Neutrocyclops brevifurca (Lowdes,\n1934). Moreover, were determined genera of species without\nidentification: Rotifera (6) and Copepoda (1). Also found were\njuvenile forms such as nauplii, copepodites of Cyclopoida and\nCalanoida, and other invertebrates such as Chaoboridae.\n\nAmong the collection stations, the most similarities,\nbased on zooplankton composition, were found for stations\nS1 and S3 during the low-water phase (Tab. I).\n\nTable I. Comparison of the different collection stations (S1, S2 and\nS3) at La go Amapa, ta king into conside ration the diverse\ncompartments of the water column according to Jaccard's index,\nat low and high water.\n\nS1xS2 S1xS3 S2xS3\n\nLow-water phase\n\nSurface 0.6956 0.6956 0.6521\n\nMiddle 0.6666 0.7058 0.5789\n\nBottom 0.4705 0.2666 0.6923\n\nHigh-water phase\n\nSurface 0.4000 0.4615 0.6086\n\nMiddle 0.5833 0.3000 0.2857\n\nBottom 0.4500 0.5500 0.3000\n\nGreater similarities occurred during the low-water phase,\nby virtue of the separation of waters from Lago Amap\u00e1 and the\nRio Acre. The zooplankton was found to be distributed through-\nout the water column, showing a greater abundance of rotifers\nduring both periods, which were concentrated in the middle\nand the top of the water column in the dry season, and prefer-\nentially in the top layer in the rainy season (Fig. 2).\n\nIn the dry season, the zooplankton had a defined pat-\ntern of distribution, clearly with a greater density in the middle\nand the top of the water column, since the bottom regions of\nstations 3 and 1 formed separate groups. Station 2 is calmer\nthan station 3 and deeper than station 1. (Fig. 2). On the other\nhand, at high water, a greater distribution of organisms is seen\nthroughout the water column, with the exception of station\n\n\n\n172 E. C. Keppeler &amp; E. R. Hardy\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zoologia 21 (2): 169\u2013177, junho 2004\n\n3, which is a deeper station. This distribution can be explained\nby the more elevated levels of chlorophyll-a (145\u00b5g.l-1) in the\nmiddle of the water column recorded during the low-water\nphase, with the inverse occurring in the rainy season. The water\ncolumn was shown to be generally oxygenated, with lower\nvalues at the end of the low-water phase (Tabs II and III).\n\nThe values for dissolved oxygen accompanied the tem-\nperature. They were also generally high in the top layer, and at\ntimes high values were also seen in the bottom layer, contrary\nto studies conducted by PAES DA SILVA &amp; THOMAZ (1997), who\nfound values close to zero in the bottom layer. Oxygenation\nwas much greater in the upper layers, permitting a propitious\nhabitat, as was the survival of the zooplankton populations.\n\nThe more elevated concentrations of chlorophyll-a oc-\ncurred in the low-water period, primarily at the end, during\nwhich there was also an abundance of particular zooplankton\ngroups because of the abundance of food.\n\nTemperature did not appear to be the cause of this distri-\nbution, since it showed small variations of only 1\u00b0 to 3\u00b0C dur-\ning low water, and of 0\u00b0 to 1\u00b0C during high water. Similarly,\npH did not vary substantially, showing values generally in the\nacid range. With regard to vertical distribution, the middle and\nbottom of the water column did not show any stratification\nduring the course of the study.\n\nLago Amap\u00e1 showed seasonal patterns influenced by the\nelevation of the water level of the Rio Acre during the high-\nwater period. During this phase, there was greater transpar-\nency, concomitant with the fall in chlorophyll-a values. How-\never, transparency accompanied proportionally the concen-\ntration of dissolved oxygen. ESTEVES et al. (1994) explained that\nthe penetration of light to the bottom favors a high photosyn-\nthetic activity throughout the water column. Temperature re-\nmained nearly constant the entire period, and among the dif-\n\nferent water layers as well, sometimes by the fact that the lake\nwas calm, showing thus the absence of stratification. There\nwas thereby a tendency for organisms to be distributed through-\nout the water column, not determining defined niches.\n\nThe pH appeared to be generally homogeneous in the\nwater column, while electrical conductivity was greater at the\nbottom. ESTEVES et al. (1994) also observed in Lago Batata a\nhomogeneous pH and high values of electrical conductivity,\nmainly at the bottom, due to the accumulation of ions result-\ning from the decomposition of organic material and from the\ncontact of the water with the sediment.\n\nThe number of zooplanktonic organisms was reduced,\nat the end of the low-water phase as well as at the end of the\nhigh-water phase, possibly due to the fluctuations in the wa-\nter level, which causes stress to the organisms.\n\nTwo species of the genus Keratella were examined in this\nstudy. The species K. cochlearis was more abundant, and oc-\ncurred in the intermediate layer of the water column, which\nalso showed low pH values and high levels of chlorophyll-a. A\npeak was shown on June 5 (during the dry season) in all three\nlayers of the water column. In the rainy season, the density\ndiminished drastically, and this species was replaced by K.\ncochlearis hispida, with density peaks in the top layer (Fig. 3),\nwhich appeared to adapt better to the changes in pH from\nneutral to slightly basic during the dry season to acidic during\nthe rainy season, along with a reduction in chorophyll-a.\n\nThree species of the genus Filinia were identified. F.\nopoliensis and F. longiseta had two similar density peaks and\nwere present during all the study period, in contrast to F.\nterminalis, which showed lower densities, mainly at low water.\nOnly one density peak was evident at high water, as of January\n19, in the top and middle layers of the water column. Brachionus\nfalcatus, abundant in the low-water phase, was succeeded in\nthe high-water phase by Brachionus calicyflorus and B. calicyflorus\nanuraeformis, present in all three layers, although the greater\ndensity being seen preferentially in the top layer (Fig. 3). When\nthis occurred, there was also a greater electrical conductivity\nduring this phase.\n\nGreater peaks for Filinia terminalis, Brachionus calicyflorus,\nBrachionus calicyflorus anuraeformis and Keratella cochlearis\nhispida occurred when there was greater electrical conductiv-\nity during the high-water phase, especially on January 19, 1998.\n\nAlkalinity, pH and electrical conductivity had higher\nvalues in the low-water than in the high-water period, which\npossibly favored the presence during low water of Brachionus\nfalcatus, Filinia opoliensis, Filinia longiseta, Keratella cochlearis\nand Moina minuta.\n\nThe density levels obtained for microcrustaceans (Cla-\ndocera) are shown in figure 3. Moina minuta was predominant\nin the middle of the water column, mainly during the dry sea-\nson, while Diaphanosoma spinulosum showed a peak in the top\nlayer during this phase, but was distributed among all three\nlayers in the rainy season.\n\nFigure 2.

In addition, in the low-water phase,\nsome associations are established among the taxa Brachionus\nfalcatus, Filinia opoliensis, Filinia longiseta and Keratella cochlearis.\n\nRotifers occurred in greater abundance in the top layer,\nand less in the middle and bottom of the water column.

Density of Chaoboridae in Lago Amap\u00e1.\n\n\n\n176 E. C. Keppeler &amp; E. R. Hardy\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zoologia 21 (2): 169\u2013177, junho 2004\n\nWith regard to the microcrustaceans, there was a greater\nabundance of Moina predominating in the low-water phase,\nespecially in the middle of the water column, accompanying\nthe presence of food.\n\nThis study showed that there was a concentration in the\nmiddle of the water column of some species of rotifers includ-\ning Brachionus falcatus, Brachionus calicyflorus, Brachionus\ncalicyflorus anuraeformis, Filinia opoliensis, Keratella cochlearis\nhispida and of the microcrustacean Moina minuta. The pres-\nence of these species in this niche is possibly explained by the\nlevels of chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen, which were\nshown to be relatively high. According to WILLIAMSON et al.\n(1996), food specific for planktonic organisms is approximately\nthree times more elevated in the middle of the water column\nthan in the top layer.\n\nWhen stratified, lakes produce compartmentalization\nand a vertical gradient in the distribution of the planktonic\ncommunities, in contrast to what was observed in Lago Amap\u00e1.\nThe absence of stratification and the presence of food, acting\ntogether, explains possibly the abundance of these species in\nthe middle of the water column.\n\nDuring the entire period studied, the levels of dissolved\noxygen showed a pronounced difference between the top and\nbottom layers with the greater values being limited to the up-\nper layers, explaining the absence of zooplanktonic organisms\nat the bottom of the lake.\n\nFISHER et al. (1983) observed during a 24-h cycle at Lago\nCalado, that the zooplankton was stratified in relation to dis-\nsolved oxygen, always being in or moving toward the most\noxygenated layer during the day. LANSAC-T\u00d4HA et al. (1992) also\nnoted that some calanoid cladocers and copepodites were dis-\ntributed preferentially in layers where the concentration of\ndissolved oxygen was more elevated.\n\nThe larvae of Chaoboridae also regulated the presence\nof plankton, although to a much lesser extent compared to\nthe physico-chemical parameters. The numbers found dem-\nonstrated the presence of a high concentration of these larvae\nin the bottom followed by the middle layer of the water col-\numn. According to NEILL &amp; PEACOCK (1980) apud HAVENS (1990),\nrotifers are the principal source of food for the first stages of\nChaoboridae. ARCIFA (1997) reported that Chaoborus spp. have\nthe potential for predation during the entire year, whereby\nthe pressure on the plankton is diminished by the seasonal\nfluctuations of the population and its vertical migration. In\nthe latter study, population growth during the warm-rainy sea-\nson reached a level of 4 ind.L-1.\n\nNonetheless, in Lago Amap\u00e1 a maximum of 12,000 ind.m-3\n\noccurred, possibly influencing the presence of zooplankton,\nmainly the cladocers, which are the preferred food for these\nlarvae.\n\nDuring low water, there was blooming period for the\nCyanophyceae algae, observed by chance in great abundance\nin samples, in addition to being visible to the naked eye in\n\nLago Amap\u00e1. The effect of blue-green algae (toxic) on the struc-\nture of zooplankton communities, influenced the distribution\nof some species in this study, which migrated to the bottom of\nthe lake during this phase, probably in search of adequate food.\n\nThe low diversity in Lago Amap\u00e1 must have been affected\nby the increase in the water level, despite a fluctuation varying\nat least 2 m during the whole hydrologic cycle. According to\nthe explanation provided by the intermediate disturbance hy-\npothesis, if the disturbances are moderate or rare, the groups\nthen tend toward an equilibrium and few species dominate, since\nthis equilibrium eliminates other species (CONNELL 1978), through\nthe competition for niches, food and predation. Therefore, a\nmoderate disturbance occurred in the environment studied here.\n\nVarious factors, such as the competition for food, preda-\ntion, presence of light, and temperature, acted together to de-\ntermine the presence of zooplankton populations in a particu-\nlar niche in the water column, whereby physical and chemical\nparameters were determinants.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe give special thanks to Dr. Janet Reid for the confir-\nmation and identification of the copepods.
