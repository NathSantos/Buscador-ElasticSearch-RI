Como importantes par\u00e2metros de medida da claridade da \u00e1gua, kd, Zeu e ZSD s\u00e3o afetados pelas subst\u00e2ncias opticamente significativas (SOS). A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ptica do reservat\u00f3rio foi realizada a partir de duas campanhas de campo realizadas no per\u00edodo seco, aqui nomeadas como BAR1 (agosto/2016) e BAR2 (junho/2017), que contaram com an\u00e1lises das propriedades \u00f3pticas inerentes (POIs), das SOS e da coleta de dados radiom\u00e9tricos para o c\u00e1lculo da reflect\u00e2ncia de sensoriamento remoto (Rsr). A localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do reservat\u00f3rio de Bariri como o segundo do Sistema de Reservat\u00f3rios em Cascata (SRC) do Rio Tiet\u00ea promove a heterogeneidade dos seus n\u00edveis de eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o na dire\u00e7\u00e3o montante-jusante al\u00e9m de caracteriz\u00e1-lo como altamente produtivo. As campanhas de campo foram marcadas por uma significativa diferen\u00e7a nos valores de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de clorofila-a ([Chl-a]) que apresentou varia\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia entre 7,99 e 119,76 pg L-1 com os maiores valores em BAR1, com decr\u00e9scimo das SOS em BAR2 em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a BAR1 e predom\u00ednio de material particulado org\u00e2nico (MPO) nas duas campanhas de campo; a turbidez variou entre 5,72 e 16,60 NTU. A absor\u00e7\u00e3o por mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica colorida dissolvida (aCDOM) foi predominante nas duas campanhas de campo, sendo mais expressiva em BAR2. Para as estimativas de kd, nove modelos emp\u00edricos e tr\u00eas modelos semi-anal\u00edticos baseados em dados radiom\u00e9tricos como raz\u00f5es entre as bandas azul/verde e azul/vermelho do sensor OLI/Landsat-8 e baseados em [Chl-a] foram avaliados. Considerando a propriedade \u00f3ptica aparente (POA) do kd, um modelo semi-anal\u00edtico baseado em POIs e na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o angular da luz apresentou os menores erros (erro m\u00e9dio percentual absoluto - MAPE) de ~ 40% em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos modelos emp\u00edricos de [Chl-a] com ~ 60% e de > 80% para os modelos emp\u00edricos baseados em raz\u00f5es de bandas. A partir das estimativas de kd, modelos de estimativa de Zeu e ZSD foram avaliados. Para as estimativas de Zeu, cinco modelos emp\u00edricos, baseados na rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre o coeficiente de atenua\u00e7\u00e3o da luz da radia\u00e7\u00e3o fotossinteticamente ativa [kd(PAR)] e de kd em 490 nm [kd(490)], e um modelo semi-anal\u00edtico, baseado na equa\u00e7\u00e3o de transfer\u00eancia radiativa, foram considerados; para as estimativas de ZSD, um modelo semi-anal\u00edtico foi testado. Os resultados obtidos foram melhores para um modelo emp\u00edrico (erro percentual absoluto - a) de Zeu com ~ 16% em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao modelo semi-anal\u00edtico (a ~ 30%) e os erros nas estimativas de ZSD foram de ~ 57%. Os erros nas estimativas de kd revelaram que a acur\u00e1cia dos modelos emp\u00edricos foi comprometida devido \u00e0 influ\u00eancia por CDOM e que o modelo semi-anal\u00edtico, por considerar a natureza \u00f3ptica de kd como uma POA, apresentou os melhores resultados. As estimativas de ZSD tamb\u00e9m foram afetadas pelas caracter\u00edsticas \u00f3pticas de Bariri, n\u00e3o apresentando correla\u00e7\u00e3o com a mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica em BAR2, marcado pelo decr\u00e9scimo de [Chl-a] e aumento dos valores de aCDOM. Zeu mostrou melhores resultados a partir de um modelo emp\u00edrico calibrado com dados \u00f3pticos semelhantes aos do reservat\u00f3rio de Bariri em compara\u00e7\u00e3o ao modelo semi-anal\u00edtico, desenvolvido para abranger as varia\u00e7\u00f5es bio-\u00f3pticas sazonais e regionais. kd, Zeu e ZSD foram espacializados a partir de imagens do sensor OLI/Landsat-8 permitindo a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o espa\u00e7o-temporal desses par\u00e2metros que apresentaram um padr\u00e3o sazonal quando analisados em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos dados de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o. kd apresentou varia\u00e7\u00e3o entre 0,89 e 5,60 m-1 para o per\u00edodo analisado (2016) e Zeu e ZSD apresentaram varia\u00e7\u00e3o entre 0,30 e 7,60 m e entre 0,32 e 2,95 m, respectivamente, para o per\u00edodo de 2014-2016. Pode-se concluir ent\u00e3o, que apesar das estimativas de kd, Zeu e ZSD terem sido afetadas pela influ\u00eancia de CDOM no reservat\u00f3rio de Bariri, o esquema semi-anal\u00edtico foi capaz de estimar kd com menor erro e permitiu as estimativas de Zeu e ZSD.\nPalavras-chave: atenua\u00e7\u00e3o da luz; qualidade da \u00e1gua; dados de sat\u00e9lite; modelos bio-\u00f3pticos.\nABSTRACT\nThe objective of this present work was estimate the euphotic zone (Zeu) and Secchi disk (ZSD) depths from the light attenuation coefficient (kd) using the Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 data in Bariri reservoir. The kd, Zeu and ZSD are important water clarity parameters and are influenced by the optically significant substances (OSS). The optical characterization was carried out with data collected in two field campaigns in the dry period, here called BAR1 (august/2016) and BAR2 (june/2017), that included analysis of the inherent optical properties (IOPs), of the OSS and radiometric data to calculate the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). The location of Bariri reservoir as the second of the Cascading Reservoir System (CRS) of Tiet\u00ea River promotes the heterogeneity of the eutrophication levels from upstream to downstream besides characterizes the reservoir as highly productive. The field campaigns presented a significant difference in chlorophyll-a concentrations ([Chl-a]) with mean variation between 7.99 and 119.76 pg L-1 with the highest values in BAR1, with reduce of the OSS in BAR2 in relation to BAR1 and predominance of organic particulate matter (OPM) in both field campaigns and variation in turbidity from 5.72 to 16.60 NTU. The absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was dominant in both field campaigns and more expressive in BAR2. For the kd estimates, nine empirical models and three semi-analytical models based on radiometric data such as ratios of blue-green and blue-red bands of (OLI)/Landsat 8 sensor and based on [Chl-a] were evaluated. Considering the apparent optical property (AOP) of kd, a semi-analytical model based on IOPs and the light angular distribution presented the lowest errors (mean absolute percentage error - MAPE) of ~ 40% in relation to the empirical models of [Chl-a] with ~ 60% and of > 80% for the empirical models based on the band ratios. Through the kd estimates, models to derive Zeu and ZSD were evaluated. For the Zeu estimates, five empirical models were considered based on the relation between the attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetically active radiation [kd(PAR)] and the kd at 490 nm [kd(490)], and one semi-analytical model, based on the radiative transfer equation; for the ZSD estimates, one semi-analytical model was tested. The empirical model of Zeu showed the better results with the (unbiased absolute percentage error - a) ~ 16% in relation to the semi-analytical model (a ~ 30%) and the estimates errors of ZSD were ~ 57%. The errors in kd estimates revealed that the accuracy of the empirical models was affected by the CDOM influence in Bariri reservoir and the semi-analytical model presented a better performance when considering the optical nature of kd as an AOP. The ZSD estimates were also affected by the optical characteristics of Bariri with no correlation to the SPM in BAR2, where the [Chl-a] decreased and the aCDOM increased. Zeu showed better results from an empirical model calibrated with similar optical data to Bariri reservoir in relation to the semi-analytical model developed to be applied in a wide range of bio-optical seasonal and regional variations. The kd, Zeu and ZSD were spatially distributed through OLI/Landsat-8 images allowing the temporal-spatial assessment of theses parameters, which presented a seasonal pattern when analyzed in relation to rainfall data. kd presented variation from 0.89 to 5.60 m-1 to the analyzed period (2016) and Zeu and ZSD presented variations between 0.30 and 7.60 m and between 0.32 and 2.95 m, respectively, for 2014-2016 period. It can be concluded, therefore, that despite of the CDOM have affected the kd, Zeu and ZSD retrievals in Bariri reservoir, the semi-analytical scheme was able to estimate kd with lowest error and enable the Zeu and ZSD estimates.\nKey-words: light attenuation; water quality; satellite data; bio-optical models.\nLIST OF FIGURES\nPage Figure 2.1 Graphics showing the location of (a) S\u00e3o Paulo State in Brazilian context; (b) Bariri Reservoir in the Cascading Reservoir System of Tiet\u00ea River; (c) sampling points of the two field campaigns carried out, BAR1 and BAR2 and (d) precipitation rate data (mm) from NASA\u2019s GIOVANNI database for the period of 2014-2017.

1: Introduction\n1.1\tBackground\nInland waters embrace the reservoirs, lakes and rivers and provide important support to diverse ecosystems and habitats. The reservoirs are commonly found in the Brazilian hydropower context and are subject of anthropogenic interferences as agricultural productions, grazing lands, urban centers and waste water which alter the natural biogeochemical characteristics of the water body. The reservoirs become environments where the algal proliferation and eutrophication processes are favorable by the nutrient increments through runoff and the increase of retention time, reducing the water quality (Lira et al., 2009; Calijuri et al., 2002).\nThe water quality is affected by the alteration of the quantities of the optical significant substances (OSS) such as the non-algal particles (NAP), phytoplankton and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The increase of OSS alters the turbidity and reduces the water clarity; the changes in turbidity affect the zooplankton community, increase the water temperature due to the high absorption of the sunlight by the suspended particles and reduce the dissolved oxygen rates in water column (Alc\u00e2ntara etal., 2010).\nThe complex environment of the reservoir requires a qualitative and quantitative monitoring. The remote sensing based on satellite data allows the spatial-temporal study of a wide region in comparison with the traditional methods as point stations of sampling collection. Recent researches have shown suitable results in estimate water properties and constituents through remote sensing data in turbid inland waters (Yang et al., 2013; Mishra et al., 2014; Watanabe et al., 2015; Alc\u00e2ntara et al., 2016; Bernardo et al., 2016; Rotta et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2017).\nAn important study of water clarity monitoring was developed in Minnesota lakes using a 20 years of satellite data from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors (TM/Landsat 5 and ETM+/Landsat 7 series, respectively) generating satisfactory results in relation to in situ data and revealing the potentiality of the Landsat for optical complex waters (Olmanson et al., 2008). The potentially of the Landsat systems for water clarity and CDOM measurements were evaluated in inland waters optically complex and CDOM-dominated. The OLI/Landsat-8 and ETM+/\nLandsat-7 presented satisfactory results (coefficient of determination - R2) for CDOM measures (R2 = 0.81 and R2 = 0.79, respectively) and for water clarity as the Secchi disk depth - ZSD (R2 = 0.818), relating the slight better performance of OLI/Landsat-8 to the higher radiometric sensitivity (Olmanson et al., 2016). The OLI/Landsat-8 data presented a satisfactory performance (R2 = 0.82) in kd retrieval in extremely turbid inland lakes (Zheng et al., 2016) and in kd (mean absolute percentage error - MAPE = 10.35%) and ZSD (linear correlation - R = 0.73) retrievals in optically variant inland waters producing good outcomes to spatial modeling of water transparency (Rodrigues et al., 2017). The Operational Land Imager (OLI) data collected by the Landsat-8 satellite present a high spatial resolution of 30 meters and a swath width of 185 kilometers with increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) indicating that the Landsat-8/OLI is suitable to monitoring water-quality parameters in a regional scale (Zheng et al., 2016).\nThe water clarity can be quantified from the vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (kd) which is estimated by measuring the decrease of downwelling irradiance with depth. The kd is an intermediary product to estimate other two water clarity parameters: the euphotic zone (Zeu) and the Secchi disk (ZSD) depths. The Secchi disk is a black-and-white disk and the oldest instrument used to measure the water clarity (Lee et al.,\n2015)\t. The kd is controlled by the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of water such as absorption (a) and scattering (bb) processes and the angular distribution of light; the kd at the wavelength of 490 nm is commonly derived from spectral remote sensing reflectance (Austin and Petzold, 1981; Mueller, 2000; Lee et al., 2013) and is considered as the inverse of ZSD which can be derived through satellite data in a semi-analytical model (Lee et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016). The Zeu corresponds to the depth where the downwelling irradiance achieves 1% of that measure at the water subsurface (Kirk, 1994). Considering the homogeneity of water column, a relation between kd(PAR), the kd at the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), is used to estimate Zeu in empirical and semi-analytical ways (Lee et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2013; Liu et al.,\n2016)\t.\nLee et al. (2013) proposed a semi-analytical equation to derive kd as the inversion of the IOPs estimated via a quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) using the fifth version (QAA_v5). Yang et al. (2014) and Rodrigues et al. (2017) applied the semi-analytical equation and found that the lowest accuracy of kd estimation and, consequently, the ZSD\nand Zeu estimations, in turbid inland waters can be related to the propagated errors of the IOPs estimations.\nThe QAA is a multi-band effective algorithm with easily applicable sequential steps to estimate IOPs via remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data for optically deep waters (Lee et al., 2002). The sequence consists, firstly, in the conversion of Rrs into the subsurface reflectance (rrs) and is followed by empirical, analytical and semi-analytical steps in four levels to acquisition of a(X) and particle backscattering coefficient (bbp(\u00c1)) and able to separate the a(\u00c0) in absorption coefficients of phytoplankton and CDOM (a^ and aCDOM, respectively), allowing the estimations of Chl-a and CDOM concentrations. The empirical steps such as the estimation of a and bbp were calibrated to seawater properties limiting the application of the QAA in optically complex waters (Yang et al., 2013). Versions of QAA were created since the original version with modifications in the empirical steps and reference wavelengths (\u00c0o) in order to improve the results. The fifth version (QAA_v5), set for \u00c00 = 560 nm, was applied in turbid inland waters, making possible the estimations of IOPs through adjustments in the algorithm (Le et al., 2009; Yang etal., 2013; Li etal., 2016).\nThis work was carried out in Bariri reservoir, part of the Cascading Reservoir System (CRS) of Tiet\u00ea River, S\u00e3o Paulo. Bariri is dominated by CDOM which compromise the phytoplankton activity, ecosystem productivity and present other effects on aquatic ecology and water chemistry that affect the water quality for human use (Zhang et al., 2009; Brezonik et al., 2015). The CDOM-rich freshwaters are greatly influenced by allochthonous source, susceptible to environmental factors such as hydrodynamic and anthropogenic activities (Zhu et al., 2014) that can compromise the kd, Zeu and ZSD estimations.\n1.2.\tHypothesis\nConsidering the nature of kd, the semi-analytical algorithm developed by Lee et al. (2013) respects the dependence on the IOPs and the angular distribution light and, therefore, will be able to produce good results in inland waters through the original form of QAA_v5, set for the Landsat-8/OLI center bands, in relation to others semi-analytical and empirical models analyzed in this study. Thus, our hypothesis bases on the fact that the semi-analytical algorithm used to derive kd, even with errors related to the\nestimative of the IOPs via QAA_v5 when applied to turbid inland waters, will enable the estimation of Zeu and ZSD through a semi-analytical scheme.\n1.3.\tObjectives\nThis study aimed to investigate the performance of a semi-analytical scheme to estimate Zeu and ZSD using kd estimates from remotely sensed data in Bariri reservoir. For this, the specific objectives were to:\n-\tCharacterize the optical properties of Bariri reservoir;\n-\tEvaluate the performance of nine empirical and three semi-analytical models of kd to choose the more suitable one for Bariri reservoir;\n-\tEvaluate the performance of six Zeu algorithms and one semi-analytical model of ZSD using as input the kd model best fitted for the Bariri reservoir and choose the best models to map the Zeu and ZSD in Bariri reservoir;\n-\tAssess the temporal-spatial distribution of derived kd, Zeu and ZSD;\n-\tAssess the effects of CDOM and the seasonality in rainfall terms on the performance of the water clarity parameters.\n1.4.\tOutline of the Dissertation\nThis dissertation is organized in 4 chapters. The chapter 1 introduces the theme, delineating the problems of this research and the steps followed to answer the questions proposed. The chapter 2 corresponds to the investigation of the performance of kd models in the aquatic environment of Bariri reservoir, exploring the limiting factors of the CDOM dominance on the absorption coefficients in the evaluated models structure. The chapter 3 corresponds to the evaluation of models to retrieve Zeu and ZSD through the derived kd data and their performances in the field campaigns. The relation of Zeu and ZSD with the water constituents also was evaluated. The chapters 2 and 3 present the characterization of the study site, the description of the field campaigns, sampling planning and the optical properties characterization of the study site. Lastly, the chapter 4 highlights the main findings and challenges of this research.\nCHAPTER 2: Retrieval of diffuse attenuation coefficient in inland waters dominated by colored dissolved organic matter\n2.1.\tIntroduction\nThe diffuse attenuation coefficient (kd) is an apparent optical property (AOP) and is defined as the exponential decrease of the ambient downwelling irradiance (Ed) with depth, therefore is related to light penetration and availability and can be used to predict the euphotic depth. AOP are those properties that depend both on the medium and on the geometric structure of the radiance distribution (Mobley, 1994).\nkd is largely determined by the inherent optical properties (IOPs), absorption (a) and backscattering (bb) coefficients in first order and, in lesser magnitude dependent on the incident radiation field as the Sun angle. IOPs are properties of the medium and do not depend on the ambient light field (Mobley, 1994).\nNon-algal particles (NAP), phytoplankton, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and water are considered the four optically significant substances (OSS) that control the kd. The kd at 490 nm [kd(490)] is generally considered and classified as a parameter of water quality, therefore is essential for monitoring the eutrophication process due to light attenuation by phytoplankton growth or suspended matter (Zheng et al., 2016). Since light availability is a critical regulator of physical, chemical and biological processes the accurate estimation of kd is critical to better understanding and modeling primary productivity, heat and gas transfer in aquatic systems.\nIn order to estimate kd(490), some empirical algorithms were developed using a direct form from normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) or remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) ratios or indirect form through products based on chlorophyll-a concentrations ([Chl-a]) (Morel et al., 2007; Mueller, 2000; Mueller and Tress, 1997; Chauhan et al., 2003; Werdell, 2005; Kratzer et al., 2008; Zhang and Fell, 2007; Wang et al., 2009). However, these models are considered site specific, which is a limiting factor for a broader application. Wang et al. (2009) and Lee et al. (2013) came up with a semi-analytical approach covering a wide range of waters. Wang et al. (2009) used a combination of two models suitable for ocean and turbid coastal waters, aiming to improve the application range of kd(490) estimations. The model from Lee et al. (2013) considered the IOPs derived from Rrs through a quasi-analytical algorithm QAA (Lee et al., 2002), and the solar zenith angle using the radiative transfer theory. The algorithm\nmake it possible the estimation of spectral kd, as well as kd(490), for water bodies ranging from the clearest ocean to turbid coastal waters.\nEven so, studies showing the use of remote sensing for kd(490) estimation in tropical productive inland waters are hampered by the lack of in situ data and theoretical framework to predict and interpret ocean color data in such waters (Gallegos et al., 1990). The optically complexity of turbid waters (mineral suspended solids, algae and associated organic particles) produce multiple scattering making it difficult the mathematical analysis of radiative transfer (Gallegos et al,. 1990). From our understanding there are no investigation of kd(490) estimation in inland waters dominated by CDOM, which is an optically active component of dissolved organic matter and plays an important role in the cycling carbon.\nCDOM is considered an important water quality indicator due to its impact on the drink water, carbon balance and aquatic ecosystems; mainly because CDOM affects penetration of photosynthetically active radiation into the water column, which affects the primary productivity. Most models use Rrs or nLw from the blue-green spectral region, in which the CDOM has high absorption. Because of that the following questions came up: (1) The kd(490) models that use the blue/green ratio will be impacted in such way that the errors will make it impossible to use? (2) How will these models be impacted in the presence of high [Chl-a]? (3) Semi-analytical models, which use IOPs as input data will perform better than the empirical ones? (4) What are the perspectives for kd monitoring from space in inland waters dominated by CDOM?\nTherefore the main goal of this paper was to assess the performance of algorithms to estimate kd(490) in inland waters dominated by CDOM, which are widely available to end users. We tested nine empirical and three semi-analytical algorithms. The selected models will help us to answer the above questions.\n2.2.\tMaterials and Methods\n2.2.1.\tStudy Area and Sampling Planning\nBariri hydroelectric reservoir (22\u00b0 9\u2019 49.260\u201d S 48\u00b0 44\u2019 21.420\u201d W) is in the middle of the S\u00e3o Paulo State and is part of the Cascading Reservoir System (CRS) of the Tiet\u00ea River (Figure 2.1). Bariri is the second of a total of six reservoirs and presented the smallest flooded area of 63 km2 in an average altitude of 450 meters. The Bariri\nreservoir is situated in a tropical climate with a dry period (April-September) and a wet period (October-March) according to Koppen classification. The water retention time varies among 7 and 24 days (Tundisi etal., 2008).\nFigure 2.1. Graphics showing the location of (a) S\u00e3o Paulo State in Brazilian context; (b) Bariri Reservoir in the Cascading Reservoir System of Tiet\u00ea River; (c) sampling points of the two field campaigns carried out, BAR1 and BAR2 and (d) precipitation rate data (mm) from NASA\u2019s GIOVANNI database for the period of 2014-2017 (TRMM Data Product; Spatial Resolution of .0.25\u00b0; Monthly Temporal Resolution). In 2017, the precipitation monthly averages were available just until July month.\n48\u00b045'0*W\t48\u00b040*0\"W\n\nThe amount of wastewater coming from the metropolitan region of Tiet\u00ea River characterizes the Bariri Reservoir as highly productive water with high average concentrations of total nitrogen (2750 pg L-1), phosphorus (87 pg L-1) and [Chl-a] (55.8 pg L-1) with the phytoplankton community dominated by cyanobacteria. As the second reservoir, the Cascading Reservoir Continuum Concept (CRCC) effect promotes the heterogeneity of the eutrophication levels in upstream to downstream in Bariri, revealed by the water transparency of the water (Barbosa et al., 1999).\nTwo fieldworks were carried out where in the first one (BAR1), 30 samples were collected from 15 to 18 August 2016 and in the second one (BAR2), 18 samples were\ntaken from 23 to 24 June 2017 (see Figure 2.1 for samples locations). The days of the field campaigns were determined according to the temporal resolution of OLI/Landsat-8 aiming to match the data collection with the satellite overpass the study site.\n2.2.2.\tWater quality and Optical Data\nThe wind speed (m s-1), pH, depth (m), Secchi disk depth (Zsd; m) and turbidity (NTU) were measured in the field with an anemometer, pHmeter, Secchi disk and turbidity meter, respectively. The water samples were collected in the field to derive the OSS, such as the Chl-a and the suspended particulate matter (SPM) as well as the inorganic (IPM) and organic particulate matter (OPM) concentrations according to Golterman et al. (1978) and the American Public Health Association Protocol (APHA, 1998), respectively.\nThe IOP data analysis followed the methodology proposed in Bricaud et al. (1981) for aCDOM while for the absorption coefficients of non-algal particle (aNAP) and the total particulate (ap), that consists in the sum of aNAP and a^, the acquisition and analyses were made in accordance with the Transmittance-Reflectance method according to Tassan and Ferrari (1995, 1998, 1999).\nThe radiometric data were obtained from the two hyperspectral RAMSES sensors (TriOS, Rastede, Germany). The sky and total radiance data (Lsky and Lt, respectively, both in W m- sr- ) and the downwelling and sky irradiance data (Ed and Esky, respectively, both in W m-) were taken with the sensors fixed by a steel frame in the boat, in a configuration of 40\u00b0 from nadir (zenith) and to azimuthal angle of 90\u00b0 in order to minimize the specular reflection (Mobley (1999). The radiometric quantities were used to calculate the remote sensing reflectance according to Equation (2.1).\nRrs(A)\nLt (A)\u2014 Lsr(A) _ Lt (2) (pLsky(A))\nEd+(A)\tEd+(A)\n(2.1)\nwhere E d+ is the downwelling irradiance measured at the water surface. The LSR is the surface-reflected radiance and consists in a multiplicative product of Lsky and p - an effective surface reflectance. The p value ( \u00ab0.02-0.05) depends on the viewing geometry and spectral variation. In agreement with that, Lee et al. (2010) proposed a calculation approach of Rrs as a function of the total remote-sensing reflectance (Trs,\nratio of Lt to Ed) and sky remote-sensing reflectance (Srs, ratio of Lsky to Ed) for each Lt and Lsky scan from the Equation (2.2):\nR re(A) \u00ab Tr s (A) - F x S re (A) - A\t(2.2)\nwhere F refers to Fresnel reflectance and it was set as 0.021 according to the viewing geometry; A is a spectrally constant settled before R r s can be derived (Lee et al., 2010). In oceanic waters, the R rs is negligible in the red and near-infrared wavelengths and A can be assumed as zero beyond 700 nm, however, for turbid inland waters, the IOPs have a significant influence in , thus, one alternative is to model the spectral based on the IOPs, and then resolve A after comparing modeled R rs and derived Rr s from Equation (2.2).\nIn sequence, the Rrs used in estimates models of kd must be simulated to the satellite signal at each spectral channel centered at a wavelength (A = 443; 482; 561; 655 nm). The band simulation consists in the convolution of the radiation signal of hyperspectral sensor and the spectral response function [Fr(A)] of the OLI sensor in wavelength interval of the spectral resolution (Barsi etal., 2014):\nRrs\nCinXRrs(A) Fr '' 4XmaXFr (A) xmin\n(2.3)\nwhere\tis the remote-sensing reflectance simulated at center wavelength; xmax and\nxmin are, respectively, the maximum and minimum values of the sensor spectral channel.\nAccording to Ed data, the kd(490) in both field campaigns was determined as the slope of Ed at subsurface depth (z) [ Ed( z) ] (Mobley, 1994):\nkd(A,z) =\n1 dEa(A)\nEd(A) dz\n(2.4)\nIn order to eliminate the noise in the\tdue to changes in the sun illumination\ncondition caused by cloud cover during the measurements, a normalization factor was required in all scans. The Ed normalization consists in a division of Esky at first scan t(z1) to Esky at subsequent scans t(zi) as factor normalization of the t(zi) according Mishra et al. (2005) and Mueller (2000):\nE'd(Zi,A) =\nEd(Zj,A)Esi{y(t(z1),A)\nEsky(t(zi)A)\n(2.5)\nwhere E ' d ( z j , A) is the normalized E J t ( z j ) .\n2.2.3.\tKd(490) models\nThe Table 2.1 summarizes the kd(490) algorithms tested in this study.\nTable 2.1. kd(490) models developed for clear ocean, coastal, turbid ocean, slightly turbid and global waters.\nType\tModel\tFormula\tCalibration Dataset\nEmpirical model with Chl-a concentration\tMorel et al.

The R(A) is the irradiance reflectance beneath the water-surface and is calculated as a function of extraterrestrial solar irradiance [F0(A)] and n Lw (Wang et al., 2009).\nThe equations from Morel et al. (2007) are based on [Chl-a] whereas the others empirical algorithms use a simple ratio of n Lw(A). The Zhang and Fell (2007) and Wang et al. (2009) are the unique empirical models based on a\tratio. The semi-\nanalytical model of Wang et al. (2009) was developed using the R(A) ratios and the Lee et al. (2013) model previously requires the calculation of a(X) and bb(k) which are obtained from the QAA_v5 (the version 5 was used in this study) with as input at the reference wavelength (A0) of 561 nm, the nearest OLI center band of A0 = 55x of QAA_v5. In the equation, the zenith solar angle (9s) was set as 40\u00b0 following the geometry used in the radiometric data collection.\n2.2.4.\tOLI/Landsat-8 Data Processing and Acquisition\nThe Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance on-demand data generated by the Landsat Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) were obtained in the U.S. Geological Survey platform (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). The LaSRC algorithm for atmospheric correction was developed using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vectorial (6SV) model. The algorithm uses the OLI Coastal Aerosol Band (0.433-0.450 pm) which works as cover for shorter wavelength as the blue band in previous Landsat and is helpful to retrieve aerosol properties (Vermote et al., 2016). Pahlevan et al. (2017) and Bernardo et al. (2016) showed that LaSRC is a consistent product to derive aquatic estimates. A total of 10 atmospherically corrected images (Path/Row 221/75) were acquired during the year of 2016, covering the months from February to November. The criteria used for the images choice was attributed to cloud free data over the reservoir.\nTo obtain the nLw(A) and R(A) and to test the kd(490) models, the surface reflectance images were divided by n to convert them into Rrs (Moses et al., 2012). The kd(490) model with the best performance was applied to the time-series of LaSRC\nimages selected to obtain the spatial distribution of the vertical attenuation coefficient. The kd(490) model best fitted for Bariri reservoir was validated through the use of the satellite image from August 15th 2016, correspondent to the first day of BAR1. In the same way, the LaSRC accuracy in kd(490) estimations was evaluated from the analysis between the Rrs converted images with the Rrs calculated from TriOS data in BAR1.\n2.2.5.\tStatistical Analysis and Accuracy Assessment\nStatistical analyses, including calculations of the maximum, minimum and average values and linear and non-linear regressions were performed. The kd(490) analyzed models were applied for BAR1 and BAR2 datasets. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the bias were used to assess the accuracy of the kd(490) models.\nRM S E = JySj=x(xe st,i -Xm ea, i/\nMAPE =\n100% vj\ni A=i\nxest,i xmea,i xmea,i\nbi US = j ^i=i(xest,i\tXm ea,i)\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n(2.8)\nwhere x e st is the kd(490) estimated value and x m e a is the in situ measure of kd(490).\n2.3.\tResults and Discussion\n2.3.1.\tRemote Sensing Reflectance Spectra\nIn BAR1 spectral curves (Figure 2.2) is possible to see a high absorption feature at about 680 nm and a reflectance peak at approximately 710 nm that can be associated with the Chl-a pigment. The sampling points with the highest [Chl-a] presented a significant peak at 550 nm, expected for water with a great amount of algae, just as seen in field campaign. The increase of reflectance in longer wavelength was an indicative of total suspended matter concentration increases. The [Chl-a] in BAR1 was approximately 37 times higher than in BAR2 dataset (see Table 2.2), which explains why the absorption by pigments was more evident during the first survey.\nIn all data set, the organic particles were predominant (Table 2.2), therefore the spectra of BAR1 and BAR2 were quite similar with lesser reflectance magnitude of BAR2 mainly because lowest OSS concentrations. In BAR2 spectra, the feature characteristic of phytoplankton absorption was not evident such as was for BAR1 due to the decrease of [Chl-a] in relation to BAR1, with the exception of the feature of the sampling point that presented the maximum value of [Chl-a] in BAR2 (19.11 pg L-1).\n0.03\nFigure 2.2.

In CDOM-rich lakes, the spectra shapes vary according to CDOM levels and the influence of other substances in absorption processes (Brezonik et al., 2015). In BAR1, the light absorption was dominated by CDOM, however the reflectance spectra assumed a shape of Chl-a due to the high concentrations and presented low reflectance values at 400-500 nm. In BAR2, with the predominance of CDOM absorption and reduction of OSS concentrations, the reflectance values assumed a nearly flat feature at ~ 600 nm.\n2.3.2.\tOptical Properties and Water Constituents\nTable 2.2 presents the descriptive statistics for optical and water parameters for the two field campaigns, BAR1 and BAR2. In BAR1, the sky was sunny in the most of the days with some moments of overcast. In BAR2, the sky was more favorable with sunny days during all field campaign. In all dataset, the average wind speed was 3.32 \u00b1 1.77 m s-1 producing some small waves on the water surface. The minimum values for both\nfield campaigns were 0 m s-1 and the maximum value was 8 m s-1 for BAR1 and 6.50 m s-1 for BAR2.\nTable 2.2.

In BAR2, the [Chl-a] variability reduced significantly with average of 7.99 \u00b1 3.27 pg L-1, varying from 3.82 to 19.11 pg L-1. Therefore, the mixed data resulted in a range from 3.82 to 709.89 pg L-1 of [Chl-a].\nThe SPM concentration (average of 8.40 \u00b1 4.64 mg L-1) showed predominance of organic particles with average of 6.06 \u00b1 4.57 mg L-1 in BAR1 as well as in BAR2, where the organic compounds predominated the SPM (1.59 \u00b1 0.44 mg L-1) with average of 1.11 \u00b1 0.32 mg L-1. The SPM presented low concentration in BAR2. In all dataset, the organic particle dominated the SPM concentration, with an average of 4.99 \u00b1 3.96 mg L-1. In respect to absorption, aNAP(482) was higher in BAR1 (average of 0.33 \u00b1 0.09 m-1) than BAR2 (average of 0.12 \u00b1 0.03 m-1). The aCDOM(482) averaged 1.57 \u00b1 0.37 m-1 in BAR1 and 1.98 \u00b1 0.76 m-1 in BAR2. The a<p(482) averaged 0.41 \u00b1 0.22 m-1 in BAR1 and 0.07 \u00b1 0.02 m-1 in BAR2.\nThe Figure 2.3 shows the average spectra of IOPs for BAR1 and BAR2 dataset.\nFigure 2.3. Absorption spectra of NAP, phytoplankton, CDOM and pure water (aw) in BAR1 (a) and BAR2 (b).\nThe aCDOM spectra presented the highest values in all spectral range in both field campaigns. On the other hand, the a^ spectra was higher for BAR1 than BAR2; it is possible to see two peaks of absorption at 450 and 670 nm in BAR1 whereas in BAR2, the characteristic a^ spectra was not evident. In BAR2, the a^ and aNAP spectra were similar with light absorption by NAP slightly higher than the absorption by phytoplankton, with the absorption curve decay at 550 nm. The absorption curve of\nNAP at blue portion of the visible spectrum represents the typical spectra of mineral and/or detrital particles, verified in BAR1 and BAR2 absorptions spectra. The atypical ao spectra in BAR2, with the exponentially increase at wavelengths shorter than 500 nm, indicate an environment with elevated CDOM absorption (Binding etal., 2008).\nAmong the three absorption coefficients already mentioned, aCDOM(482) showed the highest values in both field campaigns. Zhang et al. (2009) proved that high [Chl-a] and high aCDOM indicate that the accumulation and degradation of phytoplankton were a source of CDOM in eutrophic waters. It suggests that the organic matter is possibly originated by the phytoplankton degradation in BAR1. In BAR2, the aCDOM is also predominant with significant reduction of [Chl-a] which can suggest an allochthonous source of CDOM. The Bariri reservoir has been undergoing impacts due to the sugarcane production and the input of urban and industrial wastewaters (Pamplin, 2004).\nThe proportional contribution of the IOPs in BAR1 and BAR2 among the total absorption (at) budget in Bariri aquatic environment was computed considering the OLI bands (443, 482, 561 and 655 nm) (Figure 2.4a-d). The light absorption in BAR1 was predominant by CDOM in all wavelengths, with 63.49% \u00b1 11.59%; 67.74% \u00b1 9.98% and 69.82% \u00b1 12.56% at 443, 482 and 655 nm, respectively. At 561 nm, the CDOM contribution was the highest with 76.08% \u00b1 8.84%. The same was verified for BAR2, where the CDOM predominance was even higher with 88.28% \u00b1 5.43% at 443 nm; 88.85% \u00b1 5.70% at 482 nm; 92.07% \u00b1 5.24% at 561 nm but with the highest contribution at 655 nm with 94.02% \u00b1 .6.03%.\nIn BAR1, the phytoplankton contributed with 22.40% \u00b1 13.06%, 17.40% \u00b1 10.84%, 13.84% \u00b1 8.36% and 25.10% \u00b1 12.16% at 443, 482, 561 and 655 nm, respectively. The highest proportions at the blue and red spectral regions confirm the absorption peaks by Chl-a pigment. In sequence, the NAP presented the lowest proportion of the absorption budget with 14.11% \u00b1 4.80% at 443 nm; 14.86% \u00b1 5.27% at 482 nm; 10.07%\t4.40% at 561 nm and 5.08%\t2.99% at 655 nm. The peak of\nNAP absorption in the blue spectral region is typical of detrital or mineral particle which was also verified in BAR2, with 6.85% \u00b1 3.31% and 6.91% \u00b1 3.89% at 443 and 482 nm, respectively, and 5.03% \u00b1 3.77% at 561 nm and 2.99% \u00b1 3.01% at 655 nm. The phytoplankton achieved 4.86% \u00b1 2.30% at 443 nm and 4.24% \u00b1 2.05% at 482 nm,\nbeing higher in the blue spectral region. At 561 nm, the percentage was 2.90% \u00b1 1.65% and at 655 nm, 2.99% \u00b1 3.01%.\nFigure 2.4.

The water column was more attenuated in August/2016 than June/2017. Both months are in the dry season; however, 2016 presented the highest mean rate of precipitation from January to June when compared with 2017 over the Bariri reservoir area (Figure 2.1d). The rain carries organic matter, mainly from industrial effluents; wastewater and particulate matter to the Bariri reservoir, as well as facilitates the increasing of organic matter fluxes along the Tiet\u00ea River from upstream to downstream. The Tiet\u00ea River is one of the most industrialized basin of S\u00e3o Paulo State and the reservoirs construction promoted the rapid transformation in the land use and land cover, facilitating the pollution problems and accelerating the sedimentation process (Prado et al., 2007). The\nconcentration of water constituents was higher in August, increasing the process of absorption and backscattering of light and, consequently, showing the highest kd(490) values.\n2.3.3.\tAssessment of the vertical attenuation coefficient models\nDue to the lack of data from turbid inland waters used in the calibration of kd(490) algorithms, the adjustment for Bariri reservoir can be compromised. The algorithm coefficients developed for a wide range of waters tries to minimize this limitation although it is not a guarantee of success (Lee et al., 2005). For all kd(490) algorithms, the bands were defined according to the center bands from OLI/Landsat-8, including the blue band at 490 nm that was replaced by 482 nm. The Table 2.3 summarized the statistical results yielded after the application of kd(490) models.\nTable 2.3.

(2013)\t41.04\t1.07\t-0.90\nThe empirical models of kd(490) based on [Chl-a] underestimated the results for almost the entire dataset, except for two samples with high values of [Chl-a] which were overestimated. The coefficients of the model from Morel et al. (2007) were developed for Case I waters, with the optical properties dominated by phytoplankton, therefore, the accuracy of the model in aquatic environments with high rates of CDOM and/or suspended solids is expected to be fail (Zhao et al., 2013). The models from Morel et al. (2007) were calibrated with open ocean waters with values of [Chl-a] &lt;2.4\npg L-1, highly discrepant of the values found in Bariri reservoir, resulting in kd(490) errors of MAPE - 61% and RMSE - 1.50 m-1.\nThe empirical models using nLw spectral ratio developed for ocean open and global waters presented the worst results with MAPE around 80% and RMSE \u2014 2 m-1. Mueller (2000); Mueller and Tress (1997), Chauhan et al. (2003) and Werdell (2005) models underestimated the results of kd(490) with bias around 2 m-1. The calibration dataset involved waters with values of kd(490) up to 0.61 m-1 whereas in Bariri all dataset varied from 1.55 to 3.98 m-1.\nThe blue-green ratio nLw(490)/nLw(555) or Rrs(490)/Rrs(555) has a large uncertainties when kd(490) is greater than 0.25 m-1. The spectral ratio presents an asymptotic value with increasing OSS concentration (Mueller, 2000). Thus, this spectral ratio is not sensitive for the variations in OSS that occurred in turbid inland waters, resulting in significant underestimation of kd(490). In addition, this spectral ratio does not consider the effects of sun angle changes that decrease the accuracy of empirical algorithms for estimating kd(490) (Lee et al., 2005).\nAiming to investigate the estimation of kd(490) from MERIS, Kratzer et al. (2008) developed the empirical algorithm from the ratio of 490 nm and 620 nm for a Case 2 water optically dominated by CDOM which showed inversely relation to salinity in Baltic Sea. The Kratzer et al. (2008) model applied to all dataset from Bariri presented MAPE of 60.62% and RMSE of 1.63 m-1.\nThe empirical algorithm developed by Wang et al. (2009) combined open ocean and turbid coastal waters (from 0.3 to 0.6 m-1) through a linear regression equation of Rrs(670)/Rrs(490) ratio that showed better matching of kd(490) data when the kd(490) values of calibrated data were higher than 0.3 m-1. The application of this model in Bariri reservoir data resulted in a MAPE of 54.04% and RMSE of 1.39 m-1, yielding underestimated values (bias of -1.15) of kd(490).\nThe semi-analytical algorithms of Wang et al. (2009) were developed considering the MODIS satellite data and the absorption and backscattering coefficients derived from Lee et al. (2002). The algorithm based on the ratio R(667)/R(488) presented MAPE of 46.34% and RSME of 1.31 m-1, while the ratio R(645)/R(488) showed MAPE around 63.68% and RMSE of 1.69 m-1. The OLI sensor does not have a spectral band centered at 488 neither at 667 nm or 645 nm, but at 482 and 655 nm, respectively. Therefore, in both semi-analytical equations, the R(482) and R(655) were used and the\ndifferences found in the results above are explained by the coefficients, which in the first model presented better adjustment than the second model in Bariri reservoir.\nThe Zhang and Fell (2007) empirical algorithm and the semi-analytical algorithm developed by Lee et al. (2013) presented similar performances corresponding to MAPE of 42.90%; RMSE of 1.22 m-1 and MAPE of 41.04%; RMSE of 1.07 m-1, respectively. Calibrated with a wide range of environments (0.016 - 4.6 m-1), the Zhang and Fell (2007) model have showed greater correlation for clear waters whereas the Lee et al. (2013) algorithm showed the greatest application for turbid waters such as happens for this study site. The difference in errors among these empirical and semi-analytical algorithms could be explained by the use of 655 nm wavelength in Zhang and Fell (2007) model which introduce noise due to the high absorption rate of water in the red wavelength even after corrections in data processing.\nThe Lee et al. (2013) semi-analytical algorithm showed the lowest errors (MAPE = 41.04%; RMSE = 1.07 m-1) for kd(490) estimation in Bariri reservoir. In inland waters, the regional variability of the OSSs generates significant changes in the attenuation of light process, therefore, the Lee et al. (2013) algorithm in considering a( A ), bb( A ) and Sun angle resulted in a fewer uncertainties regarding data matching. Besides, the algorithms coefficients derived from numerical simulations reduce the dependence of a specific data range.\nEmpirical algorithms were developed (results not shown here) from Bariri using all dataset, however the results were not satisfactory, therefore Lee et al. (2013) model was chosen for mapping the variability of kd(490) in the study site.\n2.3.4.\tAssessment of the OLI atmospheric correction product\nThe evaluation of LaSRC accuracy consisted in the comparison between the OLI-derived Rrs product from August/2016 and the Rrs calculated from TriOS data in BAR1. The relative percentage errors were 50.09% at 443 nm, 20.68% at 482 nm; 17.24% at 561 nm and 29.64% at 655 nm. The highest errors at the coastal and blue regions are related to the increase of scattering in those regions. The lowest error was verified at green region with 17.24% and, in sequence at red region, the error increased again to 29.64%. The LaSRC accuracy results encountered here are compatible with the atmospheric correction analysis presented in Rodrigues et al. (2017) and Bernardo et al. (2017).\n2.3.5.\tApplication of kd(490) on OLI/Landsat-8 images\nThe variability of kd(490) in Bariri reservoir expressed in OLI/Landsat-8 was presented in Figure 2.5.\nFigure 2.5. Spatial distribution of kd(490) in Bariri reservoir using the semi-analytical model from Lee et al. (2013) considering the months from February to November of 2016. The arrows A and B highlight the reservoir zones near urban centers.\nJun.\nFeb.\nB\ni\u2014 5.60\nA\n\u2014 2.50\n0.89 m1\nOct.\tNov.\nz\nA\nN\n1 2_4\nkm\n0\nClouds\nThe spatial distribution of Lee et al. (2013) in Bariri reservoir was validated from the kd(490) estimations obtained from the image of 15th August and presented MAPE of 32.54% and RMSE of 0.95 m-1. The errors of kd(490) estimations from Lee et al. (2013) model applied for the all dataset, using the in situ Rrs, were 41.04% of MAPE and 1.07 m-1 of RMSE. The differences between the kd(490) estimations from in situ Rrs and Rrs from LaSRC are related to the decrease of the variability among the sampling points through the sample size reduction, that in the former case was 48 (all dataset) and in the latter case was 26 (4 sampling points with missing information in the image from August in region highlighted as zone B in Figure 2.5) that presented the lowest errors.\nThe increase of the percentage error between the OLI-derived Rrs at 482 nm used as input of kd(490) estimation and the kd(490) estimations for BAR1 was 11.86% and\ncould be related to IOPs estimations via QAA_v5. The application with no modifications in some empirical steps can affect the QAA_v5 performance in complex optically waters (Watanabe et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016).\nThe maximum value of kd(490) was 5.60 m-1 in April and the minimum value was 0.89 m-1 in September, both in the dry season. In the image from April, specifically in the zone B highlighted by the arrow, an expressive increase of the kd(490) was observed, which is probably related to the reduction of water velocity favoring the increase of [Chl-a] and, in a drastically way, an algal bloom, intensifying the attenuation of light in the water. Along the reservoir, excepting for zone B, the kd(490) values remained below the mean (Figure 2.6), which was expected for a period of low precipitation, confirming an atypical event in April. In September, the kd(490) was uniformly distributed around the mean, with values closer the maximum (4.40 m-1) in the northeast region of the reservoir which presents agricultural activities and bare soil areas that facilities the input of external material into the reservoir even in periods of low precipitation. Other regions of high values of kd(490) were in zone B and another winding points where the water fluxes is slower than in zone A.\nFigure 2.6. Boxplot of kd(490) spatial distribution regarding the months of February to\nNovember of 2016 in Bariri reservoir.\nThe boxplot in Figure 2.6 summarizes the statistical performance of kd(490) for each month. In dry season, the kd(490) values were closer to the maximum in May and June, with the mostly values above the mean and, concomitantly values above 2.50 m-1 in zone A. In July and August, the kd(490) started to decrease with mostly of the values closer to the minimum and below the mean, with also decreasing of kd(490) in zone A. The precipitation rates were quite smaller in July ( ~ 3.99 mm) and August ( ~ 53.83\nmm) than in May ( ~ 125.25 mm) and June ( ~ 125.43 mm) in conjunction with reducing of kd(490) in zone A which could be revealed a point source of wastewater.\nUnfortunately, the image from August, coincident with the BAR1 field campaign, has no information in the region highlighted as zone B that prevent to show the highest Chl-a concentrations in these sampling points which generated high values of kd(490) as mentioned in section 2.3.1. The mean was 1.48 m-1, with values closer to the minimum, ranging from 1.30 to 1.73 m-1, not corresponding with in situ kd(490). The precipitation rate in August was very low, resulting in low kd(490) in zone A.\nThe months of October, November, February and March are representative of wet season, however in October the mean kd(490) almost coincided with the minimum resulting in low values with some peaks in reservoir northeast and in a winding region.\nIn November, the increase of kd(490) was observed with the mean closer to maximum value, presenting some points above 2.50 m-1. In February, with higher precipitation rates than the months previously mentioned, the kd(490) was around 3.00 m-1 even with approximately 30% of the reservoir covered by clouds. In March, the kd(490) was well distributed around the mean, ranging from 1.69 to 4.87 m-1, with the highest values in northeast and extremely north of reservoir and values above 2.50 m-1 in some part of zone B and in zone A.\n2.4.\tConclusions\nAfter the application of several tests with the kd(490) estimation models available for a wide range of waters, it was verified that the empiricism does not allowed to estimate the kd(490) in an accurate way in Bariri reservoir. The uncertainty presented by the empirical models ( ~ 80% of MAPE) confirms that the blue/green wavelength ratio is not able to express the kd(490) variability in an environment dominated by CDOM which was verified in the two surveys realized. The [Chl-a] empirical models presented intermediary errors ( 60% of MAPE) when applied with the aggregated data from the two surveys realized. In BAR1, the [Chl-a] were significantly higher than BAR2; the light absorption by CDOM was maintained predominant in both surveys. Among the tested empirical models, the model developed by The Zhang and Fell (2007) was an exception achieving lower errors and statistical results close to those obtained from the semi-analytical models.\nThe semi-analytical model developed by Lee et al. (2013) presented the lowest error (MAPE of 41.04%) among the 12 models analyzed. The coefficients present in Lee et al. (2013) model were calibrated from a wide range of waters, filling the lack of the empirical models that are based on a specific dataset. However, the IOPs estimations through the original QAA_v5 can introduce some errors in inland waters due to the optical complexity.\nThe Lee et al. (2013) model was applied in atmospherically corrected OLI/Landsat-8 images (LaSRC) with a relative error percentage difference of 8.50% in relation to the application to all dataset from the Rrs obtained in situ. Therefore, the atmospheric correction was appropriate to retrieve the kd(490) and the Lee et al. (2013) model was able to highlights the main variations of kd(490) in an environment dominated by CDOM as the Bariri reservoir, allowing identify the regions with more or less light attenuation and, consequently, the biota modifications that are dependent of the photic conditions in the water column.\nThe application of kd(490) model on OLI/Landsat-8 images exhibited important temporal and spatial variability. The spatial variability was verified in points where the sinuosity of reservoir promoted the reduction of water velocity and facilitates the OSS concentrations, increasing the attenuation of light. The temporal variability was linked to significant activities around the reservoir that increase the runoff and the input of external material into the reservoir mainly in periods of high precipitation rates. Besides, the precipitation in wet season promotes the resuspension and carriage of sediments, increasing the attenuation of light.\nCHAPTER 3: Remotely sensed estimation of euphotic zone and Secchi disk depths in a CDOM dominated inland waters\n3.1.\tIntroduction\nThe penetration and availability of underwater light are controlling factors of biological (phytoplankton photosynthesis), chemical (nutrient cycling) and physical (heat transfer) processes (Kirk, 1994). The water transparency is an important parameter for environmental monitoring and water quality (Al Kaabi et al., 2016; Alikas &amp; Kratzer, 2017). The freshwater environments provide support for diverse ecosystems and habitats, however they suffer with anthropogenic interference with waste discharge and runoff which drives to changes of the water quality characterized as algal proliferation, eutrophication and increasing of turbidity and reducing of water transparency (Wetzel, 2001; Calijuri et al., 2002; Lira et al., 2009). The water transparency is affected by the optical significant substances (OSS) such as phytoplankton, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), non-algal particles (NAP) and the pure water that absorb and/or scatter the downwelling irradiance which diminish with the depth.\nThe parameters used to quantify the water transparency are the attenuation coefficient [kd(PAR)] of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the euphotic zone depth (Zeu) and the Secchi disk depth (ZSD). The kd(PAR) is the exponential decrease of downwelling irradiance with the depth and it is related to Zeu. The Zeu is defined as the depth where the downwelling irradiance of the PAR [Ed(PAR)] achieved 1% of the Ed(PAR) measured at the surface water; assuming that the water column is homogenous, kd(PAR) and Zeu are related through the equation Z e u = 4.605/ k d ( P A R) (Kirk, 1994). In the euphotic zone, there is sufficient light intensity for significant photosynthesis, therefore, the Zeu had been use to provide information of primary production in water bodies and the Zeu changes can depict environmental patterns and anthropogenic impacts (Kirk, 1994; Majozi et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2016).\nThe most common and easy way to quantify the water transparency is the ZSD, taken when the black-and-white disk, lowered in water, is no longer viewable by an observer; because the simple and universal method, the ZSD is routinely used for turbidity monitoring, water transparency, estimate the order of magnitude of optical\nsubstances in water and indicate the eutrophic state in water bodies (Binding et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2016; Alikas &amp; Kratzer, 2017). The ZSD is able to provide in first-hand the water transparency whereas Zeu measures the water clarity more rigorously and generate more reliable results (Lee et al., 2007; Majozi et al., 2014).\nIn order to estimate the water clarity using remote sensing data, some empirical and semi-analytical models were developed. Empirical models explore the relation between the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [kd(490)] and kd(PAR) to estimate Zeu in coastal waters and turbid lake waters (Zhao et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2009). Zhao et al. (2013) used MODIS/Acqua/Terra and SeaWiFS satellite-data to understand the light environment in SW Florida coastal waters. Zhang et al. (2012) calibrated a simple model to estimate kd and, further, Zeu in a shallow, turbid Taihu Lake, China using MODIS data and Wang et al. (2009) proposed to use a combination of kd(490) models to improve the accuracy of estimation of kd(490) and kd(PAR) products for both turbid and clear waters using MODIS data in Chesapeake Bay.\nLee et al. (2007), aiming an approach that avoided parameterizations regarding the wide seasonal and regional bio-optical variations, developed a semi-analytical Zeu model based on kd(PAR) and the inherent optical properties (IOPs) derived from the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA; Lee et al., 2002) using SeaWiFS and MODIS satellite data in ocean and coastal waters. Still using the QAA scheme and a mechanistic model to overcome the empirical limitations, Lee et al. (2015) proposed a semi-analytical equation to estimate ZSD as an inverse relation of kd, derived from the IOPs calculated via QAA, at the transparent window of the water body within the visible domain. This mechanist model of ZSD is a new approach of the underwater visibility theory (Preisendorfer, 1986) that aimed to interpret the exactly sighting of Secchi disk in water by the human eye. The ZSD model achieved good performance (R2 = 0.96 and absolute percentage difference of 16.7%) for a wide range of water clarities (ZSD ~ 0.1-30 m) in configuration of OLI/Landsat-8 visible bands (Lee etal., 2016).\nFrom our understanding there are no investigation of water clarity through the Zeu and ZSD parameters using satellite data in inland waters dominated by CDOM, which is an OSS of dissolved organic matter and it is considered an important water quality indicator which affect the primary productivity due to the interference in penetration of PAR into water column of water bodies, reducing the accuracy of water transparency estimation (Zhang et al., 2009). The main goals of this paper were to assess the\nperformance of models to estimate Zeu and the new ZSD model developed by Lee et al. (2015) in CDOM dominant inland waters; investigate how the estimations are affected by this optical water type and comprehend the influences of the seasonality in rainfall terms on Zeu and ZSD. The intermediary product to obtain Zeu and ZSD through the available models, kd(490), was derived from the semi-analytical equation of Lee et al. (2013) for rich-CDOM inland waters through the QAA using the OLI/Landsat-8 with mean absolute percentage error of ~41%. Six Zeu algorithms were tested and the temporal and spatial distributions of the euphotic zone and Secchi disk depths were evaluated.\n3.2.\tMaterial and Methods\n3.2.1. Study Site\nThe Bariri hydroelectric reservoir (22\u00b0 9\u2019 49.260\u201d S 48\u00b0 44\u2019 21.420\u201d W) is in the middle of the S\u00e3o Paulo State, in Tiet\u00ea River, being part of the Cascading Reservoir System (CRS) as the second one of a total of six reservoirs (Figure 3.1).\nThe Bariri reservoir has been in operation since 1969, presenting the smallest flooded area of 63 km2 in an average altitude of 450 meters and has serviced the water supply for human use, irrigation and recreation. By the reduced dimension of the reservoir, the operation type is water line with retention time variation from 7 to 24 days (Barbosa et al., 1999). The reservoir is situated in a tropical climate with a dry period (April-September) and a wet period (October-March) according to Koppen classification.\nThe Tiet\u00ea River traverses the metropolitan region of S\u00e3o Paulo State bringing an amount of wastewater in the downstream direction. The Cascading Reservoir Continuum Concept (CRCC) allows the gradual decrease of nutrients and pollutants along the reservoirs and location and retention time of Bariri reservoir promotes the heterogeneity of the eutrophication levels in upstream to downstream, revealed by the water transparency of the water. The Bariri reservoir is characterized as highly productive water with high average concentrations of total nitrogen (2750 pg L-1), phosphorus (87 pg L-1) and Chl-a (55.8 pg L-1) with the phytoplankton community dominated by cyanobacteria (Barbosa et al., 1999).\nFigure 3.1. Maps showing the location of (a) S\u00e3o Paulo State in Brazilian territory and the path/row of OLI/L8 images which the coordinates of Bariri reservoir are contained, highlighted by the red square; (b) CRS of Tiet\u00ea River in S\u00e3o Paulo State with the six reservoirs and their respective dams (1 - Barra Bonita; 2 - Bariri; 3 - Ibitinga; 4 -Promiss\u00e3o; 5 - Nova Avanhadava; 6 - Tr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os) and (c) Bariri reservoir boundaries with the sampling points of the two field campaigns.\n3.2.2.\tPlanning of Sampling and Fieldw orks\nThe establishment of the samples was based on a random stratified sampling method using an annual cycle (2013) of OLI/L8 images acquired at the USGS website (www.earthexplorer.usgs.gov). In order to analyze the natural and anthropic variations along the reservoir, the same band of each radiometrically calibrated image (each one with 6 spectral bands) were compressed and submitted to calculation of the mean and, sequentially, of the standard deviation (SD). The SD images were used in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for selection of the image with the highest variability, which was sliced for the random stratified sampling (Rodrigues et al., 2016).\nFor Bariri reservoir, 30 sampling points were established ensuring the minimal distance of 1 km between them to avoid clusters. Two fieldworks were carried out in the dry period, being the first one (BAR1) realized from 15 to 18 August 2016 with the 30\nsampling points considered and the second one (BAR2), realized from 23 to 24 June 2017 with 12 samples points less than BAR1, maintaining the points which presented high values of OSS concentrations and avoiding the clusters to ensure the spatial variability (see Figure 3.1 for sampling locations). The days of the field campaigns were determined according to the temporal resolution of OLI/Landsat-8 aiming to match the data collection with the satellite overpass the study site. The months of fieldworks were chosen to avoid rainy periods and facilitate the field data collection.\n3.2.3.\tField Data Collection\nDuring the BAR1 and BAR2, water samples for laboratory analyses, water quality parameters and optical data were collected. The water quality parameters such as depth (m), turbidity (NTU) and Secchi disk depth (ZSD; m) were sampled in both fieldworks. The wind speed (m-1) was measured using a portable anemometer.\nThe water samples were collected in the field and stored refrigerated in polyethylene bottles to derive the OSSs and IOPs. The OSSs such as the Chl-a and the suspended particulate matter (SPM) as well as the inorganic (IPM) and organic particulate matter (OPM) concentrations were obtained from 0.2-0.5L of filtered water and replica in each sample point according to Golterman et al. (1978) and the American Public Health Association Protocol (APHA, 1998), respectively. The laboratorial analyses of the IOPs were made from 0.1L of filtered water and replica in each sampling point following the methodology proposed in Bricaud et al. (1981) for the absorption coefficient of the CDOM (aCDOM) while for the absorption coefficients of the non-algal particle (aNAP) and the total particulate (ap), that consists in the sum of aNAP and phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a^). The acquisition and analyses were made in accordance with the Transmittance-Reflectance method according to Tassan and Ferrari (1995, 1998, 2002).\nThe radiometric data were obtained from the two hyperspectral RAMSES sensors, the ARC type with an angle-of-view of 7\u00b0 used for the radiance measurements and the ACC type with a cosine collector for the irradiance measurements (TriOS, Rastede, -2 -1\nGermany). The sky and total radiance data (Lsky and Lt, respectively, both in W m- sr- ) and the downwelling and sky irradiance data (Ed and Esky, respectively, both in W m-2) were taken with the sensors fixed by a steel frame in the boat, in a configuration of 40\u00b0 from nadir (zenith) and to azimuthal angle of 90\u00b0 in order to minimize the specular\nreflection (Mobley, 1999). The radiometric quantities were used to calculate the remote sensing reflectance according to Equation (3.1).\nRrs(A)\nLt (A)\u2014 Lsr(A) _ Lt (3) (pLgkyCA))\nEd+(A)\tEd+(A)\n(3.1)\nwhere E d+ is the downwelling irradiance measured at the water surface. The LSr is the surface-reflected radiance and consists in a multiplicative product of Lsky and p - an effective surface reflectance. The p value ( \u00ab0.02-0.05) depends on the viewing geometry and spectral variation. In agreement with that, Lee et al. (2010) proposed a calculation approach of Rrs as a function of the total remote-sensing reflectance (Trs, ratio of Lt to Ed) and sky remote-sensing reflectance (Srs, ratio of Lsky to Ed) for each Lt and Lsky scan from the Equation (3.2):\nRrsW \u00ab Trs(A)-FxSrs(A)-A\n(3.2)\nwhere F refers to Fresnel reflectance and it was set as 0.021 according to the viewing geometry; A is a spectrally constant settled before R r s can be derived (Lee et al., 2010). In oceanic waters, the is negligible in the red and near-infrared wavelengths and can be assumed as zero beyond 700 nm, however, for turbid inland waters, the IOPs have a significant influence in , thus, one alternative is to model the spectral based on the IOPs, and then resolve A after comparing modeled R rs and derived Rr s from Equation (3.2).\nIn sequence, the Rrs used in estimates model of kd and, in sequence, estimates models of ZSd and Zeu, must be simulated to the satellite signal at each spectral channel centered at a wavelength (X = 443; 482; 561; 655 nm). The band simulation consists in the convolution of the radiation signal of TriOS RAMSES hyperspectral sensor and the spectral response function [Fr(X)] of the OLI/L8 sensor in wavelength interval of the spectral resolution (Barsi etal., 2014):\nRrs\n4XmaXKrs(A) Fr (A)\nAmin___________\n4XmaXFr (A) Amin\n(3.3)\nwhere Rr s(X) is the remote-sensing reflectance simulated at center wavelength; xmax and xmin are, respectively, the maximum and minimum values of the sensor spectral channel.\nAccording to Ed data, the kd(490) in both field campaigns was determined as the slope Ed data simulated to satellite signal at spectral channel centered at 482 nm at subsurface depth (z) [E (f( z) ] (Mobley, 1994):\nkd(A,z) =\n1 dEa(A)\nEd(A) dz\n(3.4)\nIn order to eliminate the noise in the E s ky (A) due to changes in the sun illumination condition caused by cloud cover during the E d ( z) measurements, a normalization factor was required in all scans. The Ed normalization consists in a division of Esky at first scan t(z1) to Esky at subsequent scans t(zi) as factor normalization of the E d t(zi) according Mishra et al. (2005) and Mueller (2000):\nE'd(Zi,A) =\nEd(zj,A)Esi{y(t(z1),A)\nEsky(t(zi)A)\n(3.5)\nwhere\tis the normalized\nThe Ed data was still used for Zeu determination in both field campaigns by summing the hyperspectral Ed (A, z ) from 350 nm to 700 nm, obtaining vertical profiles of Ed (pAR) for each sampling point according to Equation (3.6).\nEd ( pa r) ( z) = C E d ( z ) dA\t(3.6)\nIn sequence, the Zeu was derived at the depth where the E d ( PAR) ( z) achieves 1% of\nthe\tavailable at subsurface water\tor, shortly, as\nEd(PAR)Cz)\nEd(PAR)C\u00b0)\n1%\n(Lee etal., 2005, 2007).\n3.2.4.\tEuphotic Zone Depth Models\nThe Table 3.1 summarizes the six Zeu models, which cover the semi-analytical and empirical ones.\nTable 3.1.

(2007) (Zeu_Lee) is a cubic-polynomial equation with the constants based on numerical simulations and two parameters, k1 and k2, estimated from the IOPs (a(490) and bb(490)) and sun angle (9s = 40\u00b0). The parameters, k1 and k2, are related with kd(PAR)(z), the diffuse attenuation of Ed(PAR)(z) in the visible domain (400-700 nm). Considering that Zeu is the layer within which the Ed(PAR) falls 1% of the surface value and kd(PAR) is approximately constant with the depth (Morel, 1988) the Zeu was related through kd(PAR) to k1 and k2 from the Equation (3.7).\nThe model generates three solutions, one negative and two positive, but the smallest positive value is consistent with the radiative transfer theory. The IOPs were obtained from the QAA_v5 proposed by Lee et al. (2009) (the version 5 was used in this study) with in situ Rrs as input, simulated at the satellite center channel of reference wavelength (A0) of 561 nm, the nearest OLI center band of A 0 = 55x of QAA_v5.\nZhao et al. (2013) aiming to improve the Zeu estimations for the calibration set of coastal waters developed an empirical hyperbolic function based on the relation between in situ measures of Zeu and kd(490), achieving better results for their study site than Zeu_Lee application.\nThe Zeu values from the empirical models were derived from the correlation between kd(PAR) and kd(490) for Zeu estimations in Wang et al. (2009) (Zeu_Wang) and in the two first equations of Zhang et al. (2012) (Zeu_Zhang_I and Zeu_Zhang_II, respectively). The equation III of Zhang et al. (2012) (Zeu_Zhang_III) was calibrated with MODIS data with a channel at the near infra-red spectral region of 748 nm and considered the ratio of Rrs(748) and solar zenith angle cosine (g0), calculated according to the sampling time, latitude and solar declination. Taking into account the attenuation coefficient dependence on the sun angle and the light angular distribution, the ratio Rrs(A)/g0 reduces the effect of sun angle on kd(PAR) estimations. From the kd(PAR) obtained in Zeu_Wang, Zeu_Zhang_I-III, the Zeu was estimated using the Equation (3.7). The relation used to obtain Zeu from kd(PAR) has been commonly applied in water quality studies (Ma et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Majozi et al., 2014).\n3.2.5.\tSecchi Disk Depth Model\nThe ZSD model analyzed in this study was developed by Lee et al. (2015) based on the inversion relation between ZSD and kd. The ZSD estimations require the application of a sequential scheme with three steps, initializing with the IOPs (a(X) and bb(X)) estimations from QAA_v5 (Ao = 561 nm); in sequence, as second step, the kd(561) calculation according to the Lee et al. (2013) from the IOPs previously estimated and, finally, as third step, the ZSD calculation from the Equation (3.8).\n1 ln f|0, 1 4 ~ Rrs( 5 6 1)|-2, 5 (kd (5 6 1 ) ) H (\t0, 0 1 3\t,\n(3.8)\nwhere k d at 561 nm was the minimal value of attenuation of Ed in the visible domain (443-665 nm) as recommended in Lee et al. (2015). The light attenuation in turbid waters is higher in the blue and red spectral regions because the selective absorption (Cairo et al., 2017; Kirk, 1994). In accordance with that, the maximum transmission of light happens at the green spectral region, called the transparency window in the visible domain, justifying the choice of Rrs(561) among the OLI center wavelengths.\n3.2.6.\tOLI/Landsat-8 Data Acquisition and Processing\nThe Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance on-demand data generated by the Landsat Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) were obtained in the U.S. Geological Survey platform (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). The LaSRC algorithm for atmospheric correction was developed using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vectorial (6SV) model. The algorithm uses the OLI Coastal Aerosol Band (0.433-0.450 gm) which works as cover for shorter wavelength as the blue band in previous Landsat and helpful to retrieve aerosol properties (Vermote et al., 2016). Pahlevan et al. (2017) and Bernardo et al. (2016) showed that LaSRC is a consistent product to derive aquatic estimates.\nA total of 31 images atmospherically corrected images (Path/Row 221/75 or 220/76) were acquired during the years of 2014, 2015 and 2016. The criteria used for the images choice was attributed to cloud free data over the entire reservoir (images with some parts covered were selected). In 2014, the twelve images were selected; in 2015, nine images were selected with March, November and December images missing; in 2016, ten images were selected with January and December images missing. In order to map the Zeu and ZSD models, surface reflectance images were divided by n to convert them into Rrs and rescaled by a factor scale of 0.0001 to convert to the 0 to 1 range (Moses et al., 2012; USGS, 2018).\nThe Zeu model with the best performance and the ZSD model from Lee et al. (2015) were applied to the time-series of LaSRC images selected to obtain the spatial distribution of depths of the euphotic zone and the Secchi disk. The Figure 3.2 displayed the flowchart of the of Zeu and ZSD spatialization.\nFigure 3.2. Flowchart showing the sequential steps followed to mapping ZSD and Zeu.\nThe Rrs of first four bands of LaSRC time-series images were used in the equations in original configuration of QAA_v5 (Lee et al., 2009) in order to obtain the a(/j and bb(X) images. The a(490) and bb(490) and a(561) and bb(561) images were used to generated the kd(490) and kd(561) images, respectively, from the semi-analytical model proposed by Lee et al. (2013). These two steps enable the mapping of ZSD using the semi-analytical equation by Lee et al. (2015) and the mapping of Zeu from any model tested in this study.\nThe ZSD model and Zeu model best fitted for Bariri reservoir were validated through the satellite image from August 15 th 2016, correspondent to the first day of BAR1. In the same way, the LaSRC accuracy in Zeu and ZSD estimations were evaluated from the analysis between the Rrs converted images with the Rrs calculated from TriOS data in BAR1.\n3.2.7.\tStatistical Analysis and Accuracy Assessment\nStatistical analyses, including calculations of the maximum, minimum and average values and linear and non-linear regressions were performed. The Zeu and ZSD analyzed models were applied for BAR1 and BAR2 datasets. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Unbiased Absolute Percentage Error (s) and the bias were used to assess the accuracy of the models.\nRMSD\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n2 0 0 % yij\t|xe s t, i X m e a, i|\nj\t1 xest,i+xmea,i\n(3.11)\nwhere x es t and the ZSD and Zeu estimated values and x m ea is the in situ measures of ZSD and Zeu.\n3.3.\tResults\n3.3.1. In situ Measurements\nThe water color in BAR1 was green in most of the sampling points whereas in BAR 2, the water was brownish. The sky during the field campaigns was in most\nfavorable with sunny days with the exception of some period of overcast in BAR1. The wind speed (m s-1) ranged from 0 to 8 among the field campaigns with the maximum value in BAR1 that presented average of 3.47 \u00b1 1.80 m s-1 and 3.10 \u00b1 2.00 m s-1.\nThe in situ Rrs spectral curves are in Figure 3.3. The spectral feature of BAR1 was predominant by Chl-a pigment influence with a significant absorption at 680 nm and two peaks of reflectance at 550-570 nm and 710 nm, corresponding to typical waters with high phytoplankton concentrations. At the green spectral region, the pigments assume the minimal absorption and all the particulate matter play the major role in reflectance. The sampling points with the highest values of Chl-a concentration ([Chl-a]) presented a peak of absorption at 440 nm. The dip verified at 625 nm is associated with the phycocyanin pigment that is present mainly in cyanobacteria (Majozi et al., 2014; Gitelson et al., 2007). The Rrs magnitude in BAR2 was lower than BAR1 due to the OSS concentrations reduction (see Table 2). The CDOM dominated the light absorption process in both field campaigns (67.74% \u00b1 9.98% in BAR1 and 88.85% 5.70% in BAR2 at 490 nm) and it was verified in BAR1 with the lower Rrs at 400500 nm while in BAR2, the Rrs curves assumed a flat feature at 600 nm, resulted of a CDOM-rich water with other substances influence (Binding et al., 2008; Brezonik et al., 2015).\nFigure 3.3. The Rrs spectra for BAR1 (a) and BAR2 (b) surveys.\nWavelength (nm)\nThe Table 3.2 presents the summary of in situ optical properties. The variability among the parameters in BAR1 was expressively higher than in BAR2. The water depth presented a range from 5.60 to 19.60 m (11.43 \u00b1 4.32 m) in BAR1 and a range from 4.70 to 21.20 m (12.65 \u00b1 4.13 m) in BAR2, showing a slight difference in water level among the field campaigns. The OSS concentrations are higher in BAR1 than BAR2,\nwith a drastic decrease of [Chl-a] mean from 119.76 \u00b1 96.43 pg L-1 to 7.99 \u00b1 3.27 pg L-1 and a decrease of [SPM] from 8.40 \u00b1 4.64 mg L-1 to 1.59 \u00b1 0.44 mg L-1. The absorption process by the organic matter also decreased with aCDOM mean of from 1.57 \u00b1 0.37 m-1 to 1.06 \u00b1 0.50 m-1 and, in the same way, the kd(490) reduced from 2.80 \u00b1 0.30 m-1 to 1.79 \u00b1 0.12 m-1 in BAR1 and BAR2, respectively. The reduction of optical substances in water reduced the turbidity from 16.60 \u00b1 7.61 NTU in BAR1 to 5.72 \u00b1 1.25 NTU in BAR2. From the decreasing of turbidity, the water clarity in Bariri reservoir increased from 2016 to 2017 that can be confirmed by the increasing of ZSD and Zeu. The ZSD presented in BAR1 a mean of 1.16 \u00b1 0.23 m and in BAR 2, the mean ZSD increased 0.9 m (2.06 \u00b1 0.19 m).

For this, some kd(490) models were tested using as input data collected in the field campaigns in order to find the best model fitted for Bariri reservoir. The results showed that the semi-analytical model developed by Lee et al. (2013) had the lowest errors (MAPE = 41.04%; RMSE = 1.07 m-1). The kd(490) was derived from IOPs (a(X) and bb(X)) by applying the QAA_v5 scheme, considering the sun angle, that makes the uncertainties regarding the data matching reduce. Therefore,\nafter the analysis among the kd(490) models tested, the one developed by Lee et al. (2013) was chosen to mapping the variability of kd(490) and to support the mapping of Zeu and ZSD in Bariri reservoir.\nTable 3.3.

The errors were considered high among the other analyzed models. Despite the model have been developed from a semi-analytical scheme with the Rrs in situ data, the empirical models showed better matching with Zeu data in Bariri reservoir.\nThe Zeu_Lee model was applied to ocean and coastal productive waters with Zeu ranging among ~ 4.30 to 82 m achieving satisfactory agreement between measured and estimated data. However, for turbid inland waters dominated by CDOM as Bariri reservoir with Zeu ranging from 1.59 to 4.03 m, the Zeu_Lee did not fit so well and overestimated Zeu in all sampling points. Some authors in order to improve the IOPs estimations in turbid inland waters parameterized some empirical phases and the reference wavelength of QAA (Li et al., 2016; Yang, et al., 2013; Watanabe et al., 2016). In contrast with that, the kd(490) estimations obtained from Lee et al. (2013) and also dependent on IOPs estimations through the semi-analytical model no parameterize achieved the best results in comparison with the empirical ones when applied for Bariri all dataset.\nThe radiative transfer approach used in kd calculation (Lee et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2013) is consistent with the definitions about the nature variations of kd, considered as an apparent optical property (AOP) (Kirk, 1994). Highly dependent on zenithal sun angle and IOPs, the semi-analytical kd ensure the adjustment in light field structure changes and the contributions of absorption coefficients of pure water (aw) and other optical constituents (a) that affect the scattering coefficients of pure water (bbw) and other optical constituents (bb), reducing, for instance, errors in longer wavelengths (600800 nm) due to high aw (Lee et al., 2018).\nThe Zeu_Lee model was applied to coastal waters with optical environmental significantly affected by CDOM and suspended matter and showed larger errors relative to in situ data. The mismatch was associated to the kd algorithm applicability that derived the Zeu values and the algorithm parameterization. The kd model used was also the Lee et al. (2013) model but in the formula version from 2005, without the extension of the minimal wavelength used in equation development that aimed in amplify the waters range application (Zhao et al., 2013).\nThe Zeu_Zhao developed for turbid coastal waters (water depth ranged between 2.520 m) presented the lowest errors with RMSD = 0.64 m, \u00a3 = 16.76% and bias = -0.33 m when applied for Bariri all dataset. The empirical model explored the relation between kd(490) and Zeu measured in situ. The success of results for aggregated data can be explained by the similar optical constituents in water. The Zeu measures were taken in data stations that showed variations in spectral shapes covering waters with optical properties influenced by allochthonous source of CDOM and waters with significant amount of absorption and scattering processes, presenting kd(490) values in situ from 0.03 to 1.29 m-1. In analyzing all dataset of Bariri reservoir, the [Chl-a] had an 77.84 \u00b1 77.15 |ig L-1 with organic particles predominance and the greater part of light absorbed by CDOM indicating a multiple external source of organic matter and the kd(490) range found was 1.55-3.98 m-1. Although the Bariri is more turbid than the calibration dataset in Zhao et al. (2013), the Zeu_Zhao showed a significant matching, higher for BAR1 (1.59 &lt;Zeu &lt;2.88 m) than BAR2 (2.22 &lt;Zeu &lt;4.03 m) which showed some disperse sampling points.\nThe empirical model Zeu_Wang had the worst performance for Bariri dataset (RMSD = 1.53 m, \u00a3 = 37.91% and bias = 1.28 m) with values in general overestimated. The kd(PAR) are related to kd(490) through an in situ data with kd(490) ranging from\n0.35 m-1 to 6.6 m-1 and turbid coastal waters more influenced by phytoplankton and suspended sediment and phytoplankton absorption predominant (Wang et al., 2009). Although the range of kd(490) values covers the range found in Bariri dataset, the equation coefficients calibrated for different optical environment showed a limitation of the model application in turbid inland waters. The equation to estimate Zeu also did not perform well in turbid inland waters in a Japan Lake, achieving relative error above 100% (Yang et al., 2015).\nThe equations available in Zhang et al. (2012) when applied with Bariri dataset resulted in intermediary values of errors regarding other evaluated models with RMSD = 1.15 m, s = 29.99% and bias = 0.90 m for Zeu_Zhang_I; RMSD = 1.24 m, s = 32.12% and bias = 1.00 m for Zeu_Zhang_II and RMSD = 1.03 m, s = 30.22% and bias = 0.024 m for Zeu_Zhang_III. The Zeu_Zhang_I and Zeu_Zhang_II are simple optical models based on the correlation between the kd(PAR) measured and kd(490) estimated by an empirical relation using the ratio Rrs(670)/Rrs(490) calibrated for turbid inland waters.\nThe coefficients in Zeu_Zhang_I equation showed slightly better results than the ones used in Zeu_Zhang_II. The Zeu_Zhang_III equation used the Rrs(748)/p.0 because the significant correlation between the near-infrared wavelength and kd(PAR), that is 97.5% explained by inorganic particles in water, and to reduce the sun angle effect. However, the results were not so different from the two former equations. The different bio-optical conditions of Bariri reservoir in relation to the extremely turbid waters, dominated by NAP, increased the mismatch between the Zeu estimations and Zeu measured. Furthermore, the kd(490) equation, available in Zhang et al. (2012), used in kd(PAR) equations was applied for Bariri aggregated data and produced large uncertainties, which maximized the errors in Zeu estimations.\nThe application of Zeu models in BAR1, BAR2 and the aggregated dataset presented few differences in results. BAR1 showed slightly lowest errors than BAR2 and it can be explained by the highest OSS concentrations in BAR1 than BAR2 once the models were based on the IOPs (Lee et al., 2007) and kd(490) which is also determined by absorption and scattering processes. The Zeu estimations (just Zeu_Zhang_I was considered from Zhang et al. (2012) due to the lowest errors presented) were plotted against the Zeu measured from in situ data for Bariri aggregated data (Figure 3.4). The estimations of Zeu_Zhao were closer to the 1:1 line and it was used to mapping the euphotic zone in Bariri reservoir.\nFigure 3.4. Comparison between derived-Zeu from in situ data and those estimated from Zeu models analyzed.\n3.3.3.\tZSD evaluation using in situ data\nThe kd(561) intermediary products to obtain ZSD semi-analytical equation (Lee et al., 2015) showed some uncertainties for Bariri dataset. When the kd model (Lee et al., 2013) was applied, the errors were almost the same with RMSD = 0.53 m-1, s = 34.72% and bias = - 0.41 m-1 for BAR1; RMSD = 0.31 m-1, s = 31.66% and bias = - 0.17 m-1 for BAR2 and RMSD = 0.47 m-1, s = 33.61% and bias = 0.33 m-1 for Bariri all dataset.\nThe errors obtained in ZSD estimations are in Table 3.4. The errors showed a large variability among the data sets with the lowest errors for BAR 1 and extremely large errors for BAR2.\nTable 3.4. Errors assessment of ZSD (Lee et al., 2015) considering the two field and the\naggregated data.\nDataset\tRMSD (m)\tbias (m)\ts (%)\nBAR1\t0.41\t-0.18\t34.10\nBAR2\t1.39\t-1.30\t97.70\nAggregated\t0.90\t-0.12\t57.10\nThe ZSD results in BAR2 presented highly underestimation in relation to BAR1 and Bariri all dataset. Rodrigues et al. (2017) tested the ZSD model performance in native form in Nova Avanhadava reservoir (downstream to Bariri reservoir) for three different\ndata groups, the first and third group were characterized by the slight dominance of inorganic particles whereas the second one showed a higher CDOM proportion. The group with higher CDOM influence presented the highest errors in ZSD estimations (RMSD = 1.18 m and bias = - 1.00 m) in relation to others influenced by inorganic matter (RMSD and bias equivalent to 0.55 m and -0.35 m, respectively, for the first group; 0.99 m and -0.90 m, respectively, for third group). Aiming to improve the results, Rodrigues et al. (2017) re-calibrated some empirical steps in QAA_v5 and the uncertainties in ZSD estimations were slightly reduced, more significantly in first and third data group than second one, which led to ZSD underestimations.\nLee et al. (2016) using the same algorithm and OLI bands for ZSD varying from 0.1 - 30 m covering clear oceanic and turbid coastal waters, achieved R2 = 0.96 and unbiased absolute percent difference of 16.7% and 18%. However, the ZSD accuracy for Bariri environment was significantly compromised.\n3.3.4.\tAssessment of LaSRC\nThe LaSRC have been used successfully to mapping water quality (Bernardo et al., 2016; Concha &amp; Schott, 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2017). The evaluation of LaSRC accuracy consisted in the comparison between Rrs from TriOS simulated to OLI bands and the Rrs derived from the reference image of August/2016 for the sample points raised in the same day of satellite overpass day. The highest variability in matching the Rrs data was at 443 nm and one sample point was chosen to show the LaSRC performance (Figure 3.5a-b).\nFigure 3.5. The spectral distribution of the sample points in Rrs in situ and Rrs_LaSRC\nderived (a) and the Rrs_LaSRC derived performance in relation to Rrs in situ.\nAt 443 nm and 482 nm, the errors were the highest with s = 78.9% and a = 60.9%, respectively. At 561 nm, the error decreased (s = 39.4%) and increased again at 655 nm (s = 53.02%). The highest errors at the coastal and blue regions are related to the increase of scattering in those regions.\n3.3.5.\tRainfall Data\nAs depicted in Figure 3.6a, BAR1 and BAR2 were realized in periods of low monthly precipitation rate with 53.83 mm and 29.03 mm in comparison to annual average of 171.10 mm in 2016 and 164.31 mm in 2017 registered in Bariri reservoir, respectively. These values are expected once they occurred in the dry period. In BAR1 period (from 15 to 18 of August of 2016), the first day of surveying data in Bariri reservoir was affected by rainfall at night period and it was verified the increase of turbidity mainly in the two last days of the field campaign where the sampling points presented the water color predominantly green. In BAR2 period (23 and 24 of June of 2017), the monthly precipitation rate was lower than in BAR1 with no rainfall events during the surveying.\nFigure 3.6. Graphics of monthly average of (a) rainfall (mm) data for Bariri reservoir, obtained from NASA\u2019s GIOVANNI (TRMM Data Product; Spatial Resolution of .0.25\u00b0; Monthly Temporal Resolution) database between 2014 and 2017. In 2017, the precipitation data were available just until October and (b) the flow rate (m3 s-1) of Bariri reservoir in the period 2014-2017 available in the SAR/National Water Agency\nThe precipitation achieved the lowest values in June/2014 (5.10 mm), August/2015 (16.77 mm) and July of 2016 (3.98 mm) and 2017 (1.56 mm). The wet months showed the monthly average nearest the maximum values, mainly in January when the precipitation rates achieved ~ 380 mm in 2016 and 2017. In turn, January of 2014 showed the lowest precipitation (101.26 mm), lower than the average of 262.38 mm as well as 2015, with 181.61 mm in January. The highest precipitation in 2015 was in February (238.94 mm) and significant rainfall was observed in September, October and November in relation to other years.\nThe pattern in the shape of precipitation lines in 2016 and 2017 were quite similar with the exception in May-June/2016 and April/2017 which presented expressive rainfall amount in the southeastern south-center in May/2016 and April/2016 and rainfall above the mean in S\u00e3o Paulo State in June/2016 according the Weather Prevision Center and Climate Studies (available in http://infoclima.cptec.inpe.br). The precipitation rates were 125.25 mm, slightly higher than monthly average (122.47 mm), in May/2016 and significant value of 125.42 mm in June/2016, compared with the annual average of 45.22 mm. In April/2017, the precipitation rate was 136.20 mm whereas the annual average for this month was 74.32 mm.\nThe lowest values were verified in 2014 even for the wet period (exception of November and December months). The Tiet\u00ea River received only about one-sixth of the usual amount of rain and was classified as extremely dry situation according to Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), presenting the most severe drought with seven months of duration in 2014 which implied directly in water supply problems (Gomes et al., 2017-a; Coelho et al., 2015; NASA, 2015). The reservoirs in Tiet\u00ea River dwindled from 3 to 5% of its reservoirs storage capacity (Coelho et al., 2015) reducing the flow rate in Bariri reservoir in the entire year of 2014 which remained above the mean (Figure 3.6b). The flow rate in 2014 presented the lowest values in relation to the subsequent years (exception of January/2015) with the minimum value of time-series of 136.57 m3 s-1 in October. The annual average for October month was 280.74 m3 s-1. The flow rate maximum value was 1419.23 m3s-1 in January/2016. The water flow delineation was according to a water line reservoir, maintaining the water retained in months with less precipitation and in the period of the drought.\n3.3.6.\tZeu using satellite-derived data\nThe Figure 3.7 presented the spatial and temporal variability of Zeu in Bariri reservoir expressed in OLI/Landsat-8 images. The annual cycle of available LaSRC images in 2014, 2015 and 2016 were used. Two images of each period (dry and wet) were chosen to show the Zeu variation in Bariri reservoir and boxplot graphic were constructed to analyze the statistical performance of Zeu in each month of the studied period (Figure 3.8). The criteria of images choice presented in this study was the months, at least two for period, with available images simultaneously in 2014-2016 and not sequentially in order to improve visually the Zeu variability. Therefore, the February, May, August and October were the months, which met the conditions mentioned above.\nFigure 3.7. Spatial distribution of Zeu using the model based on Zhao et al. (2013) for February, May, August and October months of (a) 2014, (b) 2015 and (c) 2016. The A and B arrows highlight zones which presented high variability in Zeu values among the\n3.35 m\n7.30 m\nNoData\n0.60 m\nThe maximum and minimum Zeu values were 7.30 m in May-2015 and 0.60 m in June-2014, both in the dry season (Figure 3.8a-b). The arrows highlight two zones (A and B) in Bariri reservoir which presented variability between the analyzed images. The zone A showed low Zeu values, except for May-15 image where the Zeu were high. The May-2015 image was marked by atypical rainfall (122.8 mm) equivalent to the monthly average for the 2014-2017 period (Figure 3.6a), increasing the reservoir water level and, possibly, the water velocity in this zone, reducing the optical component concentrations which, in turn minimize the water turbidity; a high Zeu variability (from 3.25 to 7.32 m) can be observed in this month (Figure 3.8b). The zone B presented significantly low Zeu in relation to zone A taking into account the proxy among them; the stain aspect in zone B can be related to an external increment which increased the turbidity punctually (Figure 3.7b). The months of May and June presented the Zeu well distributed around the mean (Figure 3.8b). In February and October, the Zeu average was 1.76 m and 2.77 m, respectively.\nFigure 3.8. Boxplot of Zeu spatial distributions in Bariri reservoir for 2014 (a), 2015 (b) and 2016 (c).\nThe drought event in Tiet\u00ea River in 2014 reduced drastically the precipitation rate in Bariri (Figure 3.6), mainly in dry period; the Zeu values were below of 4 m in most reservoir (Figure 3.8a). The high variability (from 0.59 to 4.34 m) was observed in August month with expressive decreasing of Zeu in zone A, where it was verified an algal bloom episode in analysis of the respective satellite image. The variability reduced in February and October, with lowest Zeu values in the former month (average of 1.65 m) in the beginning of drought, in relation to October (2.88 m). May-2014 showed a slight Zeu variability (from 1.83 to 2.84 m), characterized by the stain aspect (Figure 3.7a).\nThe 2016 year presents the lowest Zeu values for February, May and October in relation to previous years (Figure 3.8c). The Zeu variability was lower in February with average of 1.54 m and in October with average of 3.00 m, when the Zeu values remained closest to the maximum (Figure 3.8c). The wet period of 2016 presented great amount of rainfall with high precipitation rate in January ( ~ 300 mm) which possibly enriched the runoff process and, consequently, the increment of a great amount of suspended material into the reservoir, increasing turbidity and reducing Zeu in February. In May-2016 (Zeu average of 1.40 m), it was possible to see the Zeu increase in some part of zone A and in zone B. In August-2016, the Zeu average was 2.46 m with low variability (Figure 3.8c); it was compatible with the high [Chl-a] values (range from ~ 100 to 234 pg L-1) found in BAR1 survey in the sample points in zone A, increasing the turbidity and reducing the Zeu values. It was possible to see that Zeu followed a pattern, with high values in months of dry periods, when the amount of rainfall is reduced. Tang et al. (2007), analyzing the annual variation of Zeu, showed that in South China Sea, the values were lower in December-February (correspondent to austral summer) than in June-August (correspondent to austral winter).\n3.3.7.\tZSD using satellite-derived data\nThe spatial distribution of ZSD (Lee et al., 2013) also consisted of years of 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the same months of Zeu spatialization were highlighted (Figure 3.9); boxplot graphics (Figure 3.10) were also constructed to comprise the statistical performance of ZSD model in Bariri reservoir. The maximum ZSD value found was 2.95 m in May-15 and the minimum value was 0.32 m in June-2014, same months of minimum and maximum, respectively, in Zeu spatialization (Figure 3.9a-b). The ZSD\nvariability in May-15 was from 1.23 to 2.95 m and from 0.32 to 1.74 m in June-14 (Figure 3.10a-b). The zone A presented low ZSD values with the exception of May-15, where ZSD values were high and in zone B, the ZSD was low in relation to the reservoir in upstream direction. The ZSD in May-15 and June-15 showed highest values for these years (Figure 3.10b), accompanied by the atypical rainfall observed in this period. In 2014, the highest ZSD was in August (varying from 0.33 to 1.87 m) with decrease in zone B due to an algal bloom episode which reduced the water transparency (Figure 3.9a).\nFigure 3.9. Spatial distribution of ZSD using the model from Lee et al. (2015) for February, May, August and October months of (a) 2014, (b) 2015 and (c) 2016. The A and B arrows highlight zones which presented high variability in ZSD values among the\n0.32 m\n1.32 m\n2.95 m\nNoData\nClouds\nIn May-14, the Zsd was low (mean of 1.00 m), varying from 0.68 to 1.25 m. February and October months, in 2014, showed Zsd means of 0.67 m and 0.93 m, respectively. In 2016, the high precipitation rate in January can be related to the Zsd reduce in respective month and in February month, which showed the most values close to the minimum (1.25 m) according to the boxplot and the spatialization (Figures 3.9c, 3.10c). In May-16, the Zsd values remained close to the minimum, varying from 1.14 m to 4.84 m, with the increase of Zsd in zones A and B. In August-16, Zsd varied from 0.54 to 0.88 m, showing low variability (Figure 3.10c). The Zsd measured in situ in the same month, varied from 0.50 to 1.60 m. In October-16 image (Figure 3.9c); it was possible to observe visually the variability (0.67 to 1.17 m) of Zsd when the values remained close to the maximum value (Figure 3.10c).\nFigure 3.10. Boxplots of ZSd spatial distributions in Bariri reservoir for 2014 (a), 2015 (b) and 2016 (c).\nThe patterns of Zeu and ZSd images were the same with different magnitudes, indicating that the ZSd also is influenced by seasonal differences among the dry and wet periods and influence of external material in Bariri reservoir. In 2014, due to the occurrence of the drought event in Tiet\u00ea River, it was not possible to delineate the effect\nof seasonality in ZSD values, however, it was observed that in months which achieved the lowest rainfall values (January, June and August, for instance) the ZSD was the highest. In 2015, the months in the dry period (mainly, May and June) showed high ZSD and, in 2016, the ZSD increased according to reduce of rainfall in the dry period. Al Kaabi et al. (2016) registered that in Arabian Gulf, the ZSD was higher in April-September period than in October-March period. Such seasonal variability was observed in ZSD studies that the lowest values were found in summer and spring, when the rainfall is higher, in relation to winter (decrease of rainfall) that showed higher ZSD (Wu et al., 2015; Rodrigues et al., 2017).\n3.4.\tDiscussion\n3.4.1. Relationships between Zeu; ZSD and water quality constituents\nIn both field campaigns, the SPM concentration ([SPM]) was dominated by organic matter. The relationship between [SPM] and [Chl-a] was strong in BAR1 (R = 0.985; p &lt;0.001), however, in BAR2, the relationship was much weaker (R = 0.369) with no significance. The second field campaign had the [Chl-a] reduced and the organic matter in [SPM] was almost totally dominated by aCDOM(443) with the correlation of R = 0.996 (p &lt;0.001) while the relationship with aphy(443) was not significant. When the data of the two field campaigns were aggregated, the relationship between [SPM] and [Chl-a] (R = 0.984; p &lt;0.001) was very close of the relationship of BAR1.\nThe Zeu models tested in this study and, mainly, the Zeu_Zhao used for mapping the euphotic zone in Bariri reservoir showed increasing of the errors when applied for BAR2 (RMSD = 0.88 m; s = 19.66%; bias = - 0.38 m) in relation to BAR1 (RMSD = 0.46; s = 15.12%; bias = - 0.38 m). The relationship between Zeu and [SPM] in BAR2 was extremely weak (R = 0.10) and it is due to the high correlation of aCDOM(443) with [SPM] once the relationship between Zeu and [SPM] was higher for BAR1 than for the aggregated data (R = 0.62 and R = 0.56, respectively). The errors of Zeu estimations when applied for all dataset had a slight increase in relation to BAR1 (RMSD = 0.64 m; s = 16.76%; bias = - 0.33 m). Therefore, the predominance of aCDOM and the decreasing of [Chl-a] in BAR2 increased the mismatch between Zeu_Zhao estimations and in situ Zeu.\nFigure 3.11 shows that the Zeu is negatively correlated to [SPM] (R = - 0.546; p &lt;0.001), [Chl-a] (R = - 0.557;p &lt;0.001) and turbidity (R = - 0.550;p &lt;0.001). So, the Zeu measured in situ was slightly affected by [Chl-a] in the Bariri all dataset. The correlation between [SPM] and aphy(443) found in Bariri all dataset confirms the predominance of organic matter in the optical environment (R = 0.836; p &lt;0.001). High values of [Chl-a] indicates excessive input of nutrients in water; these regions present deficit in underwater light and, therefore, reduction of euphotic depths (Liu etal., 2016). The nutrients enrichment in water, accelerate the primary productive with great amount of phytoplankton production which was verified trough the strong relationship between [Chl-a] and aphy(443) which was R = 0.885; p &lt;0.001 (Figure 3.11). The correlation between [Chl-a] was not significant (not shown here).\nFigure 3.11. Relationships between in situ Zeu and (a) [Chl-a], (b) [SPM], (c) turbidity and between the aphy(443) with (d) [SPM] and (e) [Chl-a].\nThe high [Chl-a] verified in BAR1 and predominance of aCDOM in the total absorption of light in both field campaigns suggest a multiple external sources of organic matter entrance in Bariri reservoir depicted by the meteorological conditions, urban/industrial and agricultural waste. In addition, no significant correlation between [Chl-a] and aCDOM was verified in neither of the two field campaigns that cannot confirm the influence of autochthonous CDOM in Bariri reservoir system (Binding et al., 2008). Alterations in land use and land cover (LULC) in sub-watershed of Barra Bonita reservoir (upstream of Bariri reservoir) showed replacement of forest fragments by grazing land advanced and intensification of sugarcane production, promoting\nerosion, soil degradation and, consequently, reducing of water quality (Gomes et al., 2017a).\nIn relation to ZSD, the semi-analytical model to estimate water transparency from Lee et al. (2013) also showed an expressive increase of mismatching between the estimations and ZSD measured when applied for BAR2 in relation to BAR1. The errors increased around 63% in the first field campaign in relation to the second with RMSD = 0.41; a = 34.10%; bias = - 0.18 m in BAR1 and RMSD = 1.39; a = 97.70%; bias = -1.30 m in BAR2; the underestimations were observed in all sample points.\nIn BAR1, inverse correlations were verified: ZSD and [Chl-a] (R = - 0.737; p &lt;0.001); Zsd and [SPM] (R = -0.786; p&lt;0.001); Zsd and turbidity (R = - 0.652; p &lt;0.001). However, in BAR2, no correlation was verified between ZSD and the OSS; the relationship between ZSD and turbidity was also inverted (R = - 0.695; p &lt;0.05). The BAR2 survey showed [Chl-a] mean of 7.99 \u00b1 4.10 pg L-1 whereas in BAR1 survey, the mean was 119.76 \u00b1 96.43 pg L-1; the absorption of light in both field campaigns was dominated by CDOM. The ZSD is a reasonable indicator of trophic conditions once it was inversely correlated to [Chl-a], however it was not observed in colored lakes with low [Chl-a] (Gholizadeh et al., 2016), justified by the high mismatch of ZSD estimations in BAR2 related to in situ ZSD.\nConsidering the Bariri all dataset, the relationships between in situ ZSD and [Chl-a], [SPM] and turbidity were inverses (R = - 0.658; p &lt;0.001, R = - 0.655; p &lt;0.001 and R = - 0.643;p &lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3.12).\nFigure 3.12.

The in situ Zeu and ZSD showed similar responses to influence of\noptical constituents in Bariri reservoir, with ZSD showing highest correlation with them. The relationship between the two parameters of water transparency and quality was significantly strong (R = 0.893;p &lt;0.001).\n3.5.\tConclusions\nAfter the application of several tests with the Zeu estimation models available for a wide range of waters, it was verified that the empirical model of Zhao et al. (2013) (s \u2014 16.76%) excelled the semi-analytical algorithm performance presenting (s \u2014 35.11%), countering the affirmation that IOP-centered approach is able to be applied in a wide range of bio-optical waters. The Zeu semi-analytical algorithm achieved the lowest accuracy between all the others empirical models tested with the exception of the Zeu_Wang (s - 37.91%).\nThe ZSD estimations from the semi-analytical model presented uncertainties (s \u2014 57%); the estimations were highly affected by the predominance of CDOM in Bariri reservoir (s \u2014 97.7% when applied for BAR2) confirmed by the inexistence of correlation between ZSD and [Chl-a] and ZSD and [SPM], despite the reduction of the correlation between ZSD and the OSS when the data was aggregated. The accuracies of Zeu estimations among the tested models also compromised the results with the reduction of [Chl-a] in BAR2, however the magnitude was lesser than the ZSD estimations once the correlation between Zeu and [SPM] was higher in BAR2. It is possible to conclude that ZSD is highly affected by the increase of [Chl-a].\nThe Zeu in situ varied from 1.58 m to 4.00 m and ZSD varied from 0.5 m to 2.50 m, showing reliable results of water transparency. The accuracy of ZSD reading is subject to properties of observer eye as a contrast sensor; the boat shadow and also depends on the wind speed with an error varying from 0.2 to 0.5m (Alikas &amp; Kratzer, 2017) whereas the Zeu was obtained from Ed(PAR) normalized to reduce the changes in sun illumination condition and in a geometry configuration to avoid the wind and boat shadow effects in radiometric data acquisition.\nUsing the atmospherically corrected OLI/Landsat-8 (LaSRC) Zeu and ZSD images, we verified the seasonality pattern controlled by the rainfall in Zeu and ZSD which remained the same delineation but with different magnitudes. The Zeu and ZSD showed high values in the dry period (April-September); in contrast, showed low values in the\nwet period (October-March), when the input of external material is facilitated in reservoir.\nCHAPTER 4: Final Considerations\n4.1.\tHighlights\nThe results achieved in this dissertation confirm the hypothesis that the semi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al., 2013) to estimate kd produced the lower errors (MAPE = 41.04% and RMSD = 1.07 m-1) among others semi-analytical and empirical models; the kd semi-analytical model was effective to map the attenuation coefficient and to be an intermediary product for Zeu and ZSD estimations. In a semi-analytical scheme, the ZSD was derived as an inverse relation with kd through the semi-analytical model from Lee et al. (2015). The accuracy achieved in ZSD estimations was lesser than the kd estimations through the semi-analytical scheme (s = 57.10% and RMSD = 0.90 m) and it was related to the strong influence of CDOM in the ZSD.\nThe Zeu and ZSD estimations were affected by the CDOM dominance in Bariri reservoir and the accuracies of estimations were more compromise in BAR2 where the influence of CDOM was higher than in BAR1. The Zeu and ZSD are highly related to precipitation, presenting the highest values in dry periods, where the input of external material is reduced.\nThe applicability of the semi-analytical equation to estimate Zeu developed by Lee et al. (2007) was not verified with high errors (s = 35.11% and RMSD = 1.40 m) in relation to the empirical model by Zhao et al. (2013) (s = 16.76% and RMSD = 0.64 m). These results suggest that the Zeu was more represented by a model developed for an aquatic environmental with similar optical constituents to Bariri reservoir than for a semi-analytical model using the IOP approach and calibrated for waters optically described only by phytoplankton.\nFrom the spatialization, the inverse relation between kd; Zeu and kd; ZSD was observed, with the high kd values correspondent to low Zeu and ZSD values where the increase of the attenuation of light indicates increase of water constituents and, consequently, increase of turbidity and reduce of the Zeu and ZSD.\nTo our knowledge, there is no previous study to assess the potentiality of Landsat-8/OLI data to estimate and map the water clarity parameters considered in this research in inland waters dominated by CDOM. The QAA_v5 in the configuration of the band centers of the Landsat-8/OLI was able to estimate the IOPs used in the semi-analytical\n70 model to derive kd, making possible the estimations of Zeu and Zsd and the asses of the temporal-spatial distribution of the water clarity parameters in Bariri reservoir.\nREFERENCES\nAlc\u00e2ntara, E.; Novo, E.; Stech, J.; Lorenzzetti, J.; Barbosa, C.; Assireu, A.; Souza, A.
