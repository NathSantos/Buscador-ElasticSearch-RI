Este est\u00e1 posicionado numa \u00e1rea de \n\ntransi\u00e7\u00e3o entre a falha transformante da Gloria, delineando a fronteira entre as placas Africana e \n\nEuroasi\u00e1tica, e a parte mais oeste da cintura orog\u00e9nica Alpina, marcada pelo Arco de Gibraltar. \n\nO Golfo de C\u00e1dis \u00e9 uma regi\u00e3o sismicamente ativa e como tal, pensasse ter sido o epicentro do \n\nGrande Terramoto de Lisboa, Portugal, de 1755, que atingiu um magnitude de 8.5 a 8.7 na escala \n\nde Richter. O terramoto originou o maior tsunami decorrido at\u00e9 agora na zona oeste da Europa, \n\nlevando \u00e0 destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da cidade de Lisboa. Esta atividade tect\u00f3nica ocorre no fundo do mar em \n\nestruturas respons\u00e1veis pelo escape de fluidos, como pockmarks (pequenas depress\u00f5es no fundo \n\ndo mar), cristas diap\u00edricas, carbonate mud mounds e vulc\u00f5es de lama. Os vulc\u00f5es de lama s\u00e3o \n\nestruturas sedimentares localizadas no fundo do mar, criadas pela r\u00e1pida advec\u00e7\u00e3o de fluidos e \n\nlamas saturadas de metano, provenientes das camadas sobre pressionadas de sedimentos do fundo \n\ndo mar. Estes devido a exala\u00e7\u00e3o de fluidos geol\u00f3gicos, permitem a exist\u00eancia de comunidades \n\nbiol\u00f3gicas quimiossint\u00e9ticas. \n\nO principal objetivo deste trabalho consiste em compreender a influ\u00eancia das falhas \n\nSWIM e dos vulc\u00f5es de lama na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da macrofauna no Golfo de C\u00e1dis. V\u00e1rios passos \n\nforam realizados de forma a tornar poss\u00edvel a sua concretiza\u00e7\u00e3o, assim como a consulta de artigos \n\npublicados, onde se recolheram 122 esp\u00e9cies do filo Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, e \n\nEchinodermata, o uso da batimetria multifeixe e da refletividade do fundo do mar (backscatter) \n\ncom o intuito de se obter informa\u00e7\u00e3o espacial detalhada sobre as estruturas em estudo, a \n\nlocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica, a dist\u00e2ncia das falhas SWIM e a sua associa\u00e7\u00e3o com os vulc\u00f5es de lama, \n\ne a examina\u00e7\u00e3o das correntes oceanogr\u00e1ficas locais. Das esp\u00e9cies em estudo, 29 s\u00e3o \n\nquimiotr\u00f3ficas (18 da classe Poliqueta e 11 da classe Bivalvia) e 93 heterotr\u00f3ficas (17 da ordem \n\nTanaidacea, 16 da classe Ophiuroidea, 56 da classe Gastropoda e 3 da classe Bivalvia). As \n\nesp\u00e9cies heterotr\u00f3ficas incluem todos os organismos que obt\u00eam energia para o seu metabolismo \n\na partir de fontes de carbono org\u00e2nico, em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o encontram-se as esp\u00e9cies autotr\u00f3ficas que \n\nfixam o carbono inorg\u00e2nico usando a luz do sol (fotoautotr\u00f3ficos) ou energia qu\u00edmica \n\n(quimioautotr\u00f3ficos). Os seres quimioautotr\u00f3ficos (neste trabalho denominados de \n\nquimiotr\u00f3ficos), devido \u00e0 aus\u00eancia de luz, s\u00e3o os \u00fanicos organismos a habitarem o fundo do mar. \n\nEstes organismos normalmente vivem em fontes hidrotermais, fontes frias e outros ambientes \n\nredutores, e podem ser, ou n\u00e3o, simbiontes. As fontes hidrotermais, na sua maioria, est\u00e3o \n\nlocalizadas ao longo do oceano onde fluidos a elevadas temperaturas se libertam do fundo do mar. \n\nEstas podem ser distinguidas entre dois tipos principais: as fumarolas negras e as brancas. As \n\nfumarolas negras emitem colunas de fumo quente, por volta dos 370 \u00baC, e s\u00e3o compostas por \n\npart\u00edculas pretas e finas de sulfureto. Este fluido mistura-se rapidamente com a \u00e1gua de fundo \n\n(bottom water) rica em oxig\u00e9nio, resultante da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de grandes quantidades de sulfureto \n\ne silicato, formando assim as chamin\u00e9s hidrotermais. No geral, as fumarolas brancas encontram-\n\nse nas margens dos montes e descarga de fluidos, exibindo temperaturas entre os 265 e 300 \u00baC. \n\nDevido as suas baixas temperaturas, quando comparadas com as fumarolas negras, as fumarolas \n\nbrancas est\u00e3o incrustadas de tubos de vermes e outos organismos. As fontes frias s\u00e3o sistemas \n\ngeol\u00f3gico e geoqu\u00edmico ativos localizados onde o enxofre e o metano reduzido emergem dos \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n\nsedimentos do fundo do mar, que se formam devido \u00e0 migra\u00e7\u00e3o ascendente de hidrocarbonetos \n\ndissolvidos e/ou gasosos. As fontes frias ocorrem nas margens passivas e ativas do mundo inteiro \n\ne apresentam uma grande varia\u00e7\u00e3o temporal e espacial de fluxo. As suas express\u00f5es superficiais \n\nincluem vulc\u00f5es de lama, pockmarks, piscinas de \u00e1gua salgada, \u00f3leo e infiltra\u00e7\u00f5es de asfalto, \n\nsendo os vulc\u00f5es de lama e os pockmarks os mais comuns. \n\n Os dados utilizados neste trabalho foram compilados a partir da bibliografia mais \n\nrelevante sobre a macrofauna dos vulc\u00f5es de lama do Golfo de C\u00e1dis, incluindo v\u00e1rios artigos \n\npublicados recentemente (Dworschak and Cunha 2007; G\u00e9nio et al. 2008, 2013; Hil\u00e1rio and \n\nCunha 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008; Bla?ewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a, 2011b; Oliver et al. \n\n2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011, 2013). As amostras foram recolhidas utilizando diferentes \n\nequipamentos (p.e.: Gravity Corer - GC, FLUFO Lander - FLUFO, USNEL Box Corer - USNEL, \n\nMulti Corer - MUC, Geology Dredge - GD, Kasten Corer - KC, BIGO Lander - BIGO, TV-Grab \n\n- Gr, Suction Sampler ROV - SUS, Push Corer ROV - PUC, NIOZ Box Corer - NIOZ) \n\ndependendo do objetivo espec\u00edfico da cada campanha, da natureza geol\u00f3gica do fundo do mar \n\namostrado e da disponibilidade de equipamentos do navio.  \n\nNo ArcMap, o componente principal do ArcGis (Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Geogr\u00e1fico) foi \n\ncriada uma base de dados geogr\u00e1fica usando-se o ArcCatalog, de nome Biodata, para armazenar \n\ntodos os dados espaciais e tabulares. Os dados foram organizados em layers: Feature Classes e \n\nRaster Dataset, dando origem aos mapas utilizados ao longo desde trabalho. Todos os mapas \n\nforam projetados utilizando-se o sistema de coordenadas UTM Zona 29N Datum WGS84. \n\nNo total foram analisadas 122 esp\u00e9cies recolhidas em 105 esta\u00e7\u00f5es, 18 pertencem \u00e0 \n\nfam\u00edlia Siboglinidae (filo Annelida, classe Polychaeta), 14 \u00e0 classe Bivalvia (filo Mollusca), 56 \u00e0 \n\nclasse Gastropoda (filo Mollusca), 17 \u00e0 ordem Tanaidacea (filo Arthropoda, Subfilo Crustacea, \n\nclasse Malacostraca), uma \u00e0 ordem Decapoda (filo Arthropoda, subfilo Crustacea, classe \n\nMalacostraca) e 16 \u00e0 classe Ophiuroidea (filo Echinodermata). No Golfo de C\u00e1dis, a maior \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies encontra-se a pouca profundidade (200 a 1200 m) e est\u00e3o \n\nmaioritariamente localizadas nos vulc\u00f5es de lama. As esp\u00e9cies heterotr\u00f3ficas foram encontradas \n\nna maioria das estruturas em estudo, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o do vulc\u00e3o de lama Semenovich. Este resultado \n\nest\u00e1 de acordo com o esperado, uma vez que os organismos heterotr\u00f3ficos apresentam uma \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o global. O n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies heterotr\u00f3ficas diminui com o aumento da profundidade, \n\npossivelmente devido \u00e0 escasses de alimento. A via nutricional dominante dentro dos organismos \n\nquimiotr\u00f3ficos \u00e9 a thiotrophy, o que acontece devido \u00e0 elevada disponibilidade de enxofre na \n\nforma de sulfureto ou enxofre nas \u00e1reas de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o de metano no Golfo de C\u00e1dis. As esp\u00e9cies \n\nmetanotr\u00f3ficas apenas se encontram em dois vulc\u00f5es, Mercator (351 m) e Captain Arutyunov \n\n(1324 m), o que indica que o sistema biogeoqu\u00edmico no Golfo de C\u00e1dis \u00e9 possivelmente dominado \n\npor enxofre. A elevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies quimiotr\u00f3ficas ocorre em vulc\u00f5es de lama \n\nlocalizados nas falhas SWIM 1 e SWIM 2, a uma profundidade superior a 1220 metros, o que \n\nsugere que estas falhas agem preferencialmente como condutas de fluidos, alimentando essas \n\nesp\u00e9cies. De uma forma geral, as infiltra\u00e7\u00f5es de metano s\u00e3o especialmente comuns e ativas a \n\nprofundidades entre os 500 e os 1000 metros, em que a temperatura e a press\u00e3o combinam para \n\ndesestabilizar os hidratos de g\u00e1s, mas no Golfo de C\u00e1dis esta profundidade pode aumentar devido \n\n\u00e0 influ\u00eancia da \u00e1gua quente vinda do Mediterr\u00e2neo (Mediterranean Outflow Water). A maior \n\nlimita\u00e7\u00e3o deste trabalho foi a diferen\u00e7a existente entre o esfor\u00e7o de amostragem, que se \n\nencontrava entre uma e 19 esta\u00e7\u00f5es.  \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-Chave: Macrofauna, Esp\u00e9cies Quimiotr\u00f3ficas, Vulc\u00f5es de Lama, falhas \n\nSWIM, Golfo de C\u00e1dis, distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica.   \n\n\n\n \n\nix \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located in a complex tectonic area of the North-East Atlantic Ocean, west of \n\nGibraltar Strait, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco. It straddles across the Africa-Eurasia lithospheric \n\nplate boundary, defined by the SWIM strike-slip faults, where presently tectonic activity is occurring. \n\nThis tectonic activity is reflected in fluid escape structures on the seabed: pockmarks, diapiric ridges, \n\ncarbonate mud mounds and mud volcanoes. The exhalation of geological fluids allows for the existence \n\nof biological chemosynthetic communities on the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz. The main goal \n\nof this work is to understand the influence of the SWIM faults and mud volcanoes on the distribution of \n\nmacrofauna. This study was based on published records of 122 species of the Phyla Annelida, Mollusca, \n\nArthropoda, and Echinodermata, spatial information extracted from detailed swath bathymetry and \n\nbackscatter, geographic localization, distance to the SWIM faults and association to mud volcanoes and \n\ninspection of the local oceanographic currents. \n\n The data used in this work was compiled from the most relevant bibliography on the fauna \n\nobserved in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes, including several recently published articles (Dworschak \n\nand Cunha 2007; G\u00e9nio et al. 2008, 2013; Hil\u00e1rio and Cunha 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008; Bla?ewicz-\n\nPaszkowycz et al. 2011a, 2011b; Oliver et al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011, 2013). The samples were \n\nobtained using different gears depending namely on the specific objectives of each campaign, on the \n\ngeological nature of the sampled seafloor, and on the ship equipment availability. \n\nUsing the ArcMap, a comprehensive geodatabase was created using ArcCatalog to store all the \n\nspatial and tabular data. The data was organized in layers: Feature Classes land Raster Dataset, which \n\nallowed to create the final maps. In total 122 species were analysed from 105 stations, 18 belong to the \n\nFamily Siboglinidae (Phylum Annelida, Class Polychaeta), 14 to the Class Bivalvia (Phylum Mollusca), \n\n56 to the Class Gastropoda (Phylum Mollusca), 17 to the Order Tanaidacea (Phylum Arthropoda, Sub-\n\nPhylum Crustacea, Class Malacostraca), one to the Order Decapoda (Phylum Arthropoda, Sub-Phylum \n\nCrustacea, Class Malacostraca) and 16 to the Class Ophiuroidea (Phylum Echinodermata).  \n\nIn general, the higher concentrations of species in the Gulf of Cadiz occur at low depths, from \n\n200 to 1200 m and are mostly located in the mud volcanoes. The heterotrophic species were found in \n\nmost of the studied features of the Gulf of Cadiz, except in Semenovich MV, as expected, since they \n\noccur globally. The number of these species decreases with depth probably because the available food \n\nalso becomes scarcer. The thiotrophy is the dominant nutritional pathway of the chemotrophic species. \n\nIt occurs due to the high availability of sulfur in the form of sulfide or sulfur in the methane seepage \n\nareas of the Gulf of Cadiz. Therefore these species only occur in mud volcanoes, except in Pen Duick \n\nEscarpment. The methanotrophic species are only located in two mud volcanoes, Mercator (351 m) and \n\nCaptain Arutyunov (1324 m), which indicates that the biogeochemical system in the Gulf of Cadiz is \n\nprobably dominated by sulfur. The highest concentration of chemotrophic species occur in mud \n\nvolcanoes located on the SWIM 1 and SWIM 2 faults at water depths ? 1200 m. Thus suggesting that \n\nthese faults act as preferential fluid conduits, feeding those species. In general, the methane seeps are \n\nespecially common and active at water depths of 500\u20131000 m, where temperature and pressure combine \n\nto destabilize gas hydrates (Hester and Brewer, 2009), but in the Gulf of Cadiz this depth may be greater \n\nowing to the influence of the warmer Mediterranean Outflow Water (Niemann et al. 2006; Sommer et \n\nal. 2009).  \n\n\n\n \n\nx \n\n \n\nKeywords: Macrofauna, Chemotrophic Species Mud Volcanoes, SWIM faults, Gulf of Cadiz, \n\ngeographic distribution.  \n\n\n\n \n\nxi \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThis research project would not be possible without the support of several people.

Motivation and objectives \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz has been studied extensively since the 1970ies from a geological, \n\noceanographic and biological point of view for various reasons, such as: \n\n- It straddles across the Africa-Eurasia lithospheric plate boundary, defined by the South West \n\nIberia Margin (SWIM) strike-slip faults, where the Alpine orogeny terminate; \n\n- It is the locus of important mega-seismicity, like the 1755 Lisbon earthquake; \n\n- It is a gulf where various Atlantic currents come together and meet the Mediterranean Outflow \n\nWater; \n\n- Biological chemosynthetic communities associated with the exhalation of geological fluids \n\nhave been found in the last two decades, only. \n\n \n\nThe mud volcanoes in the Gulf the Cadiz have been studied for the past two decades and it has \n\nbeen found that they host chemosynthetic species associated with cold seeps that depend on methane \n\nand sulphate.  The motivation for this work is trying to understand if there is a relationship between the \n\ngeologic substrate, environmental conditions and the distribution of the macrofauna. \n\nThus, the main goal of this work is to understand the influence of the SWIM faults and the mud \n\nvolcanoes on the distribution of macrofauna in the Gulf of Cadiz. This study was based on published \n\nrecords of 122 species of the Phyla Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Echinodermata, spatial \n\ninformation extracted from detailed swath bathymetry and backscatter, geographic localization, distance \n\nto the SWIM faults and association to mud volcanoes and inspection of the local oceanographic currents.  \n\nIn order to achieve this scientific goal the following technical tasks were carried out: \n\n1. Construction of a database including the compilation of all biological information available \n\nin published scientific papers; \n\n2. Using the ArcGIS software as a study tool in order to analyse the spatial distribution \n\nof macrofauna in the Gulf of Cadiz; \n\n3. Analyse the macrofauna species distribution according to their metabolic strategy, \n\ngeographic distribution and depth; \n\n4. Analyse the distribution of the macrofauna as a function of the distance to the SWIM faults \n\nand to mud volcanoes. \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n1.2. Thesis Outline \n\nThis dissertation is organized in the following sixth chapters: \n\nFirst Chapter - Introduction  \n\nThe thesis presents an introduction (this chapter) about the fluid circulation and seepage in \n\nsedimentary basins, the geophysic data, the submarine mud volcanoes, the general context of the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz and the Trophic Status.  \n\nSecond Chapter \u2013 Regional Setting \n\nThe second chapter describes the main environmental drivers of the biological assemblages \n\nstudied in this work: the oceanographic circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz and the existence of major right-\n\nlateral strike-slip faults (the so called SWIM faults).  \n\nThird Chapter \u2013 Study Areas \n\nThe third chapter presents all study areas within the Gulf of Cadiz in which macrofauna species \n\nwere reported to occur: the El Arraiche Field, the Carbonate Province. The geologic and biologic \n\ncharacteristics of these features are described, based on the information available from published \n\nscientific papers and cruise reports.  \n\nFourth Chapter \u2013 Data and Methods \n\nThe fourth chapter addresses the employed methodological approach, including several aspects \n\nof the used software package, the ArcGis. \n\nFifth Chapter \u2013 Results \n\nIn the fifth chapter are presented the main results of the analyses performed, including mapping \n\nof taxa distribution.    \n\nSixth and Seventh Chapters \u2013 Discussion and Conclusion \n\nThe sixth chapter concerns the discussion of the obtained results, and the seventh chapter the \n\nconsequent main conclusions.  \n\n \n\n1.3. Fluid Circulation and Seepage in Sedimentary Basins \n\nThe chemoautotrophs, because of the absence of light, are the only autotrophic organisms in the \n\ndeep sea (see subchapter 1.7). These organisms usually inhabit hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and \n\nother reducing environments and can be free-living or symbiotic. Since cold vents are so far the only \n\nsource of crustal fluids exalted into the shallow sediments and to the seafloor in the study area, these \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nsystems are have described in more detail as well as the origin of methane, the main energy source for \n\nchemotrophic species at these depths. \n\n \n\n1.3.1. Hot Vents \n\nThe seafloor seepage can be distinguished in two categories, Hot Vents (Hydrothermal Vents) \n\nand Cold Seeps. Hot Vents, in its majority, are located along the ocean spreading centres where high \n\ntemperature fluids escape from the seafloor (Damm, 1990). Asthenospheric upwelling brings the mantle \n\nrocks up to the surface. As a result, the lithostatic pressure decreases, allowing adiabatic fusion of part \n\nof the mantle rocks. The resulting magmatic fluid of this partial fusion (primary magma) feeds the \n\noceanic ridges' typical volcanism. This volcanism, drastically, modifies the geothermal gradient. The \n\ngeothermal gradient variation promotes water convention through the oceanic crust rocks (i.e.: Basalts).  \n\nIn contact with the oceanic crust rocks, the seawater heats up to 300-400\u00b0C and becomes extremely \n\ncorrosive. This hot fluid dissolves the surrounding basaltic rock, leaching out metals and other elements. \n\nThe fluid begins rising rapidly back to the surface due to increased pressure, being responsible for \n\nthe occurrence of fluid seepage at the sea floor (Hot Vents). Two main types of hot venting systems, can \n\nbe distinguish, the black or the white smokers (Figure 1.1 and 1.2). The black smokers emit hot plumes \n\n(~370\u00baC) loaded with fine, dark particles of sulphide material. This fluid is quickly mixed with the \n\nambient oxic bottom water, resulting in the precipitation of bulk sulphide and silicate minerals, forming \n\nhydrothermal vent chimneys (Kelley, 2001; Gartman et al. 2014). The white smokers are, in general \n\nlocated on the margins of the mounds and discharge fluids exhibiting temperatures between 265 and \n\n300 \u00b0C. Due to their relatively lower temperatures, when compared with the black smokers, the white \n\nsmokers are typically encrusted with worm tubes and other organisms. Their venting fluids are white \n\nbecause the white barium and calcium sulphate (BaSO4 + CaSO4) minerals precipitates (Libes, 1992; \n\nKelley, 2001).  \n\n \n\n1.3.2. Cold Seeps \n\n Cold seeps form due to upward migration of hydrocarbons, dissolved and/or gaseous (Fischer \n\net al. 2012; Sauer et al. 2015). These geologically and geochemically active systems (Omoregie et al. \n\n2009) are found where reduced sulfur and methane emerge from seafloor sediments (Levin, 2005). They \n\noccur worldwide (Figure 1.3) at passive and active continental margins and show strong temporal and \n\nspatial variations in the flux (Fischer et al. 2012; Sauer et al. 2015). The cold seeps surface expressions \n\ninclude mud volcanoes, pockmarks, brine pools, oil and asphalt seeps, being the mud volcanoes and \n\npockmarks the most common (Petersen and Dubilier, 2009). The Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Cadiz (the \n\nmost extensive cold seepage area known along the different European margins; Dworschak and Cunha, \n\n2007; Hil\u00e1rio and Cunha, 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008), the continental margins of India, the western \n\nAfrican margin and the Eastern Mediterranean, are examples of passive margins prone of cold seepage \n\n(Omoregie et al. 2009; Wenau, 2013). These active seafloor systems often host dense and \n\ndiverse microbial and faunal communities fuelled by low temperature fluids (when compared with the \n\nhot vents) and by gas emissions to the sea floor (Omoregie et al. 2009; Petersen and Dubilier, 2009; \n\nWenau, 2013). The typical temperatures of the cold seep are close to the temperature of the bottom sea \n\nwater where they occur. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.1 - Surface features and internal structures of an active hydrothermal mound and stockwork complex \nat an oceanic spreading centre (Schulz and Zabel, 2000). \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 - A: Global distribution of the Hot Vents (Archive Website: http://archive.noc.ac.uk/).

Methane formation  \n\nIn the earth\u00b4s crust, the methane is very abundant and it is often found to be related with fluid \n\nflow features and gas hydrate formation. In seabed sediments there are three possible sources of \n\nmethane: thermogenic, abiogenic and microbial (as specified above). \n\nMethane seepage occurs when the amount of organic matter contents in the sediments are \n\nsufficient to allow the generation of high volumes of methane within the sedimentary column and the \n\nfeatures that facilitate the methane migration towards the seafloor are present. The escape of fluids, such \n\nas methane from the seafloor is a consistent feature throughout geologic time, as documented by both \n\nseismic surveys and seepage outcrops (Judd, 2003). \n\nA \n\nB \nFigure 1.3 \u2013 A: World-wide distribution of \n\nmodern and ancient cold seeps (adapted \nfrom Campbell et al. 2002). B: Methane \n\nbubbles (Gas Plumes) flow in small \nstreams out of the sediment on an area of \nseafloor offshore Virginia north of \nWashington Canyon (Okeanos Explorer \nWebsite: http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/). \nThe blue square shows the methane \nbubbles location, illustrated by Figure B. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n1.3.3.1. Thermogenic Methane \n\nThe thermogenic methane occurs when the organic matter that is not degraded by methanogenic \n\nmicrobes within the top 1000 m of the sedimentary column is buried and can be degraded by \n\nthermocatalystic processes. The organic matter that survives the burial is transformed into amorphous \n\norganic matter (kerogen), under the influence of increasing temperature and pressure. The kerogen \n\nundergoes thermal cracking, while burial increases, which leads to the formation of various \n\nhydrocarbons compounds with solid, liquid and gaseous fractions. The most abundant and mobile \n\nmolecule formed is the methane, since it has the simplest and the smallest molecule size, therefore it is \n\nthe most prone to migrate to the seabed (Judd, 2001). \n\n \n\n1.3.3.2. Abiogenic Methane  \n\nAbiogenic methane (or abiotic) is formed by chemical reactions (carbon dioxide reduction; \n\nLollar et al. 2002) that do not directly include organic matter (Etiope and Lollar, 2013). The most \n\ncommonly invoked reaction for abiotic hydrocarbons generation is the Fischer\u2013Tropsch type reaction \n\nthat converts CO2 to hydrocarbon gas by reacting it with H2 (Potter et al., 2004; 2013; Cao et al., 2014): \n\n???2 + (3? + 1)2 ? ???2?+2 + 2??2?                                           Equation 1.1  \n\n \n\nMethane (CH4) is produced when ? = 1: \n\n \n\n              ??2 + 4?2 ? ??4 + 2?2?                                                                  Equation 1.2 \n\n \n\nThe hydrothermal alteration of Fe-rich minerals, at temperatures above 200\u00baC, is one of the \n\npossible origins of the H2 required for the reaction (Potter et al. 2004; Tassi et al. 2012). This process \n\noccur during the magma cooling, during the serpentinizations of ultramafic rocks (e.g. the \n\nserpentinization of olivine in ultramafic rocks will generate magnetite and H2, which contributed to the \n\nelevated CH4 and H2 concentrations in hydrothermal fluids venting from submarine ultramafic-hosted \n\nsystems, fumarolic gases of volcanoes and in fluid inclusions in alkaline complexes; Lollar et al. 2002; \n\nCao et al., 2014) and more commonly in hydrothermal systems during water-rocks interactions (Lollar \n\net al. 2002). \n\n \n\n1.3.3.3. Microbial Methane \n\nThe decomposition of organic matter, realized by microbial activity (e.g.: methanogenic \n\narchaea), at small burial depths under low temperature and pressure conditions, originated the microbial \n\nmethane (Judd, 2001; Moore and Wade, 2013). In the oceans, the most of the organic matter available \n\nis generated through photosynthesis by primary producers (autotrophs organisms; see subchapter 1.7) \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nand after the dead of the organisms, settles through the water column. The organic matter is oxidized in \n\nthe uppermost oxygen-rich layer of the sedimentary column (the top few millimetres or centimetres of \n\nthe sediments) as long as oxygen is available. In the anoxic environment immediately below the oxygen \n\nrich zone, oxidation stops and the organic matter is buried and may be decomposed anaerobically. This \n\nis a very complex process and the final steps of it may be summarized by the following equation \n\nrepresenting the formaldehyde decomposition into methane and carbon dioxide by the action of \n\nmethanogenic microbes: \n\n \n\n2??2? ? ??4 + ??2                                                                                              Equation 1.3 \n\n \n\n1.3.4. Gas Hydrates  \n\nGas hydrates are crystalline solids formed from water and hydrocarbon gases under low \n\ntemperature and high-pressure conditions (Figure 1.4; L\u00e9on et al. 2009). The water molecules form \n\ncages containing guest molecules such as methane and other light hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane \n\nand pentane; Grauls, 2001). They are common worldwide in sediments of continental margins at water \n\ndepths exceeding 300 m (L\u00e9on et al. 2009). The methane hydrate is the most common hydrate form in \n\nthe marine sediments (Schmidt et al. 2005) but clathrates of carbon dioxide or sulphide may also occur \n\n(Arvo, 2014). Gas hydrates are considered by the scientific community as the main hydrocarbon source \n\nfor the coming century, as resources account for 50 % of the total organic carbon in the earth or twice \n\nthe conventional fossil fuel energy (Grauls, 2001). \n\n \n\nB \n\nMethane Molecule \n\nWater Molecule \n\nA \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Gas hydrates.

Geophysical Data \n\nTo pursue the present study, it was mandatory to discuss the different geophysical data and \n\nmethods, such as swath bathymetry, seismic reflection and backscatter, based on which the morphologic \n\nfeatures of the Gulf of Cadiz were found and described. \n\n \n\n1.4.1. Bathymetry \n\nThe swath bathymetry is an important acoustic tool to investigate the seafloor morphology. It \n\ncharacterizes the seafloor topography and allows the interpretation of the geomorphology of the \n\nseafloor. Therefore it is used to identify the mud volcanoes and define the settings where the macrofauna \n\noccurs. \n\n \n\n1.4.2. Seismic Reflection \n\nThe seismic reflection method is based on the fact that the acoustic signals propagates in the \n\nwater column and in the sub-seafloor, and are reflected by interfaces between media with different \n\nacoustic impedance resultant mainly from differences in density between the two rocks or sediments. \n\nSeismic reflection data corresponds therefore to an acoustic vertical 2D image of the structure and the \n\nstratigraphic layers under the seabed. This method depends on the generation and detection of acoustic \n\nwaves that are mechanically generated. When the seismic reflection profiles are of very high resolution \n\nthey may image fluid channels within faults and mud volcanoes allowing a better interpretation of the \n\ncold seeps systems. \n\n \n\n1.4.3. Backscatter \n\nThe backscatter data consist of a measurement of the intensity and characteristics of the echoes \n\nreturns from the sound pulses at the seafloor. The backscatter signal depends on the physical nature of \n\nthe seafloor, the frequency and angle used and orientation of the illuminated surface. Acoustic \n\nbackscatter data are used for classifying seafloor characteristics. A weak return signal (low intensity) \n\nindicates a soft bottom substrate, while a strong return signal (high intensity) indicates a hard bottom \n\nsubstrate. \n\nChemosynthetic cold seep communities and authigenic carbonate may cause an acoustic \n\nimpedance and roughness clearly distinct than the surrounding normal seafloor. Therefore, acoustic \n\nbackscatter data (high backscatter) can be used to identify the distribution of potential seeps sites. \n\nAcoustic anomalies at the sea-floor morphology can be detected with side-scan sonars mounted on \n\nsubmersibles, ROVs, or towed vehicles, which can mark the location of gas seeps (e.g.: mud volcanoes \n\nand pockmarks; Naudts et al. 2008; Orange et al. 2002). \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n1.5. Submarine Mud Volcanoes \n\nSubmarine Mud Volcanoes (MVs) are sedimentary structures on the seafloor created by the \n\nrapid advection of fluid and methane-saturated muds from over-pressured sediment layers deep beneath \n\nthe seafloor (Vanneste et al. 2012). They are formed when a mud rich material with clasts and other \n\nfluids reaches the seafloor, where extrusive features (such as mud flows, craters, gryphons, mud pools \n\nor salses) are formed. The material extruded from the MVs is composed of a fluidized mixture of \n\nsediments dominated by clays, liquids and gases that, in general, incorporate rock fragments (e.g.: clasts) \n\npulled up from the pierced sedimentary sections (Magalh\u00e3es, 2007). Although marly clay and salt \n\ndiapirism are considered important in the formation of the MVs, seismic profile analysis and \n\ngeochemical data indicate that mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz is fault-controlled (Nuzzo et al. \n\n2009; Vanneste et al. 2013), since some of the MVs are located along major WNW-SE and ENE-SW \n\ntrending faults (Pinheiro et al. 2003).  \n\nIn general the MVs occur along the world\u00b4s oceans (Figure 1.5; Vanneste et al. 2011). Fifty of \n\nthese were confirmed by coring (Medialdea et al. 2009) on the Iberian and Moroccan margins (Pinheiro \n\net al. 2003; Vanneste et al. 2013), because on this area we have a relatively thick sedimentary succession \n\nin which the diagenetic and compaction processes generate significant amount of overpressure and fluids \n\n(water and hydrocarbons) and in which the tectonic setting with faults promotes the seepage of these \n\nfluids (Vanneste et al. 2012). They are defined as conical shape positive morphological features in \n\nrelation to the regional morphology, with a central feeder chimney or conduit and extrusive features \n\nsuch as mud flows (Cordes et al. 2010; Vanneste et al. 2012). The MVs are in water depths ranging \n\nfrom 200 to 4000 m (Cunha et al. 2013), with a diameter between 800 to 4000 m and up to 200 m height \n\n(Vannest et al. 2011; Vanneste et al. 2013). These MVs show considerable variations in morphology, \n\ndimension and composition of erupted material and fluids (Pinheiro et al. 2003; Van Rensbergen et al. \n\n2005b). The MVs situated in the deeper areas of the Gulf of Cadiz are under the influence of deep \n\nAtlantic water masses, in turn the shallower mud volcanoes are strongly influenced by the Mediterranean \n\nOutflow Water (Pinheiro et al. 2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). \n\nThe MVs usually occur in petroliferous regions. Their seepage fluids are mainly solutions \n\nenriched by hydrocarbon gases (particularly CH4), hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and petroleum \n\nproducts and their escape is expressed in the sea floor by positive reliefs such as mounds or cones \n\n(Stadnitskaia et al. 2006). MVs are active during short periods of time (ranging from hours up to years) \n\nthat intercalate with, in general, longer periods of dormancy that typically vary between hundreds to  \n\nthousands of years (Vanneste et al. 2012). The study of authigenic carbonates is one way to evaluate the \n\nlong-term variation in carbon fluxes, which precipitate from the ascending fluids and are generally well \n\npreserved in the geological record (Vanneste et al. 2012). In general, gas and fluid seepage activity at \n\nthe MVs is considered to be moderate with advection velocities up to 15 cm yr-1. However the presence \n\nof methane-derived authigenic carbonates throughout the Gulf of Cadiz suggests several episodes of \n\nextensive methane seepage in the past (Vanneste et al. 2012). \n\nThe first Mud Volcano was discovered and sampled in Gulf of Cadiz in 1999 (Pinheiro et al. \n\n2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b) during the Training Through Research (TTR) 9 cruise (Pinheiro et \n\nal. 2003), of Research Vessel (R/V) Professor Logachev which were carried out within the framework \n\nof the UNESCO/IOC \u2018Floating University\u2019 Programme (Stadnitskaia et al. 2006) and since then have \n\nbeen extensively investigated during several research cruises (e.g.: TTR 10, Anastasya, TTR 11, TTR \n\n11A, Tasyo, Cadipor, TTR 12, GAP, TTR 14, Merian Cruise, Darwin Cruise, TTR 15, TTR 16, TTR \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n17, MvseisHesp\u00e9rides; Kenyon et al. 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006; Akhmetzhanov et al. 2007, 2008; Hensen \n\net al. 2007; Ivanov et al. 2010).  \n\n \n\n1.6. The Gulf of Cadiz \u2013 General Context \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is a wide marine basin located in a complex tectonic area of the North-East \n\nAtlantic Ocean, west of Gibraltar Strait, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Figure 1.6; Navarro et \n\nal. 2006; Duarte et al. 2009; Rosas et al. 2009; Duarte, 2011; Vanneste et al. 2011). It is positioned on \n\nthe transition area between the Gloria transform fault zone delineating the African-Eurasian plate \n\nboundary in the Atlantic, and the Western-most part of the Alpine-Mediterranean orogenic belt, marked \n\nby the Gibraltar (or Betic-Rif) Arc (Le\u00f3n et al. 2006; Stadnitskaia et al. 2006; Vanneste et al. 2011). \n\nThe region is seismically active and is thought to host the epicentre of the famous 8.5 to 8.7 (Johnston, \n\n1996) magnitude 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake that originated a devastating tsunami and decimated \n\nthe city of Lisbon, Portugal (Hensen et al. 2007; Duarte, 2011). It was the largest tsunami ever \n\nexperienced in Western Europe (Zitellini et al. 2009).  \n\nFigure 1.5 - Worldwide occurrence of mud volcanoes (Magalh\u00e3es, 2007).

Ab - Alboran; Cb - Calabria; Cs - Corsica; Sd - Sardinia. The absolute ages in Ma correspond to the \nlimits of the intervals. \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary, the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean induced the \n\ndivergence of North America and Eurasia, in parallel with the convergence of Africa and Eurasia \n\n(Figure 1.7). The African continent was diverted to north causing the progressive closure of oceanic \n\nbasins of the Tethys Ocean and the rapid propagation to west of the Alpine, Betic\u2013Rif orogenic collision \n\nfront in the Gulf of Cadiz, at the same time that the western Mediterranean basin development \n\n(Maldonado et al. 1999). \n\nThe Gibraltar Arc was formed due the convergence between Africa and Eurasia plates. The \n\nconvergence caused the narrowing of the East-West oceanic corridor between Africa and Iberia and led \n\nto the collision of the Alboran terrane (that was migrating almost unimpeded towards the Atlantic Ocean, \n\nin the Middle Miocene) with the SE Iberia and NW Africa (see Figure 1.7 - C; Duarte, 2011). The \n\nGibraltar Arc migrated west dragged by the roll back of the subducted Gibraltar oceanic slab. At the \n\nsame time as the Gulf Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW; a high rugosity sedimentary slope with an \n\nundulating surface morphology; Gutscher et al. 2008) formed as a consequence of rollback subduction \n\nof the Tethyan slab beneath Gibraltar (Duarte, 2011; Duarte et al. 2011; see Figure 1.7 - D) on top of \n\nbasement faults (nowadays the SWIM faults). \n\nAccording to Duarte et al. 2011, the formation of the SWIM faults can be associated with the \n\nopening of the Tethys Ocean. The SWIM basement faults were probably inactive during Middle \n\nMiocene times, although capable of originating a linear-like perturbation in the GCAW surface \n\nmorphology. At the same time, the convergence between Iberia and Africa gradually suffered a \n\ncounterclockwise rotation, shifting from N\u2013S (see Figure 1.7 - B) to near WNW\u2013ESE (see Figure 1.7 \n\n- E). This rotation triggered a dextral strike-slip reactivation of the basement (SWIM) faults (see Figure \n\n1.7 - F) during a period in which the subduction driving the GCAW growth was slowing down. \n\n \n\n1.7. Trophic Status \n\n The macrofauna species studied in this work were analysed according to their metabolic \n\nstrategy (chapter 5). Given this criteria and the following detailed explanation such species can be \n\nclassified as autotrophic or heterotrophic. A second level of classification considers the type of \n\nsymbiotic relationship between the deep-sea invertebrate host and its methanotrophic and/or thiotrophic \n\nbacteria (see below).  \n\nHeterotrophs include all organisms that obtain the energy for their metabolism from organic \n\ncarbon sources in their food (e.g.: all animals, including man, fungi, and many parasitic plants and \n\nsaprophytic angiosperms as well as many microorganisms). In opposition autotrophs fix inorganic \n\ncarbon using sunlight (photoautotrophs) or chemical energy (chemoautotrophs).  \n\n \n\n1.7.1. Thiotrophy and Methanotrophy \n\nSymbiotic invertebrates in deep-sea environments derive all or part of their nutrition from microbial \n\nsymbiont metabolism. The organisms that rely partly on chemotrophic nutrition but retain the ability to \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nfeed heterotrophically are designated as mixotrophic. Symbiotic associations with thiotrophic or \n\nmethanotrophic bacteria occur in a wide range of animal species that live in reducing environments (e.g.: \n\nhydrothermal vents, whale falls, sunken wood, cold seeps and sediments; Petersen and Dubilier, 2009). \n\nIn rare cases species harbour both methanotrophic and thiotrophic symbionts, in which case they are \n\ndesignated as possessing a dual symbiosis.  \n\nThiotrophic bacteria can exploit the chemical energy from the oxidation of sulfide or sulfur with \n\noxygen or nitrate for their cell metabolism and growth (Grunke et al. 2012) while the methanotrophic \n\nbacteria utilize methane as a sole carbon and energy source (Hanson et al. 1996). The bivalves with \n\nsulfide-oxidizing gill symbionts are frequently found in environments that are inhospitable to other \n\ninvertebrates due to a low oxygen (O2) content and the presence of free hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Sulfide-\n\noxidizing bacteria are involved in symbioses with members of at least five bivalve families, occurring \n\nintracellularly in Vesicomyidae, Lucinidae, Mytilidae and Solemyidae, and mostly extracellularly in \n\nThyasiridae (Rodrigues et al. 2010; Oliver et al. 2011). In addition to the bivalve, others important \n\nsymbiotic seep organisms include siboglinidae polychaetes (vestimentiferan, frenulate and monoliferan \n\ntubeworms) and sponges (Cladorhizidae). \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\nRegional Setting \n\n2.1. The oceanographic circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz  \n\nThe Atlantic Ocean in Gulf of Cadiz is characterized by three main water masses (Eastern North \n\nAtlantic Central Water, North Atlantic Deep Water and Mediterranean Outflow Water; Figure 2.1) with \n\ndifferent characteristics of salinity, temperature, oxygen content and current velocities. Hence, a \n\ncombination of water circulation, chemically reduced habitat and trophic input will determine the \n\nbenthic communities of this region (Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a).  \n\n \n\n2.1.1. Eastern North Atlantic Central Water  \n\nThe North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) is located at the main thermocline of the North \n\nAtlantic Ocean (Pollard et al. 1996) and is characterized by an almost linear decrease of potential \n\ntemperature (16.0?C to 12.5?C) and salinity (36.25 to 35.50 \u2030; Alves et al. 2011) with depth. This body \n\nof water, in the upper 500 \u2013 1000 m of the ocean (Pollard et al. 1996), is influenced by the mix of several \n\nwaters (Cianca et al. 2009), the Mediterranean Water, the Antarctic Intermediate Water and the Labrador \n\nSea Water (Mauritzen et al. 2001). The NACW, in the eastern North Atlantic, is more saline (usually \n\nby less than 0.1 \u2030 at constant temperature) than in the western North Atlantic, due to the influence of \n\nMediterranean Water (Pollard et al. 1996; Mauritzen et al. 2001). The Eastern North Atlantic Central \n\nWaters (ENACW) can be subdivided in two types as an exchange result of water and heat within the \n\nthermocline (Padin et al. 2011): the eastern North Atlantic central water subtropical (ENACWt) and the \n\neastern North Atlantic central water subpolar (ENACWp). The ENACWt range from 12.2 to 18.5 \u00b0C \n\nand from 35.66 to 36.75 \u2030 and its origin was located in a front near the Azores. The ENACWp is \n\nformed at the eastern flank of the North Atlantic Current, approximately north of Cape Finisterre (43\u00baN) \n\nand corresponds to water between 4 and 12 \u00b0C and between 34.96 and 35.66 \u2030 (Bode et al. 2002; Padin \n\net al. 2011). Besides the thermohaline differences, ENACWp and ENACWt also show different \n\nchemical properties due to changes in ventilation rates and remineralization of organic matter. In this \n\nway, the ENACWt is a nutrient-poor water whereas ENACWp is characterized by high nutrient levels \n\nmainly due to deep winter MLD (mixed layer depth) in the formation region (Padin et al. 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Overview of the oceanographic patterns in the Gulf of Cadiz area, showing the three main water masses: ENACW (Dark grey arrow), MOW (Dark spot) and \nNADW (White fat arrow). The MOW current is split into two main currents, the MU and the ML, which is divided into the SB, the PB and the IB (modified from Garc\u00eda et al. \n2009; Wienberg et al. 2009).  \n\nMorocco \n\nSW Iberia \n\nMU \n\nMOW \nML \n\nPB \n\nIB \n\nSB \n\nWater Masses  \n\nMediterranean Deep Water (MDW) \n\nMediterranean Intermediate Water (MIW) \n\nEastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) \n\nAtlantic Inflow Water (AIW)  \n\nNorth Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)  \n\n \n\nMOW Circulation \n\nMediterranean Outflow Water (MOW)  \n\nMediterranean Upper Water (MU) \n\nMediterranean Lower Water (ML) \n\nStrait of Gibraltar \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Mediterranean Outflow Water  \n\nThe Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), results from the exchange of water masses between \n\nthe Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean (Mulder et al. 2009), North Atlantic Surface Water (0 \u2013 \n\n100 m) and North Atlantic Central Water (100 \u2013 700 m; Toucanne et al. 2007; Singh et al. 2015). It is \n\nan energetic, saline (38 \u2030) and warm (13 \u00b0C) water mass (Figure 2.2; Toucanne et al. 2007; Mulder et \n\nal. 2009; Bozec et al. 2011; Kh\u00e9lifi et al. 2014) moving from the SE to the NW along the middle slope \n\n(which is formed by four relatively flat terraces with gradients of less than 0.5\u00b0, at average depths of \n\n500, 675, 750 and 850 m; Figure 2.3) between 500 and 1200 m water depth above the NADW (Garc\u00eda \n\net al. 2009). This independent strong contour current enters the Gulf of Cadiz at depths of 250 \u2013 300 m \n\nwith a western trend and velocities of up to 250 cm s-1 (Garc\u00eda et al. 2009; Mulder et al. 2009). The \n\nmain MOW current divides into two main currents that flow along the seabed at water depths of 300 \u2013 \n\n1400 m, the Mediterranean Upper Water (MU) and the Mediterranean Lower Water (ML; see Figure \n\n2.1; Mulder et al. 2009).  The MU represents the upper, less dense (salinity is 37.07 \u2030), warm (13.7 \n\n\u00b0C) core that flows at the base of the upper Spanish and Portuguese continental slopes at depths of 300 \n\n\u2013 600 m. Its average velocity is 0.46 ms-1. The ML constitutes the lower, more saline (salinity is 37.42 \n\n\u2030) current that forms the main MOW. Its mean temperature is 13.6 \u00b0C, is centred between 600 \u2013 1400 \n\nm and its velocity range between 0.2 and 0.3 m s-1 (Mulder et al. 2009). The ML, splits into three minor \n\nbranches (Mulder et al. 2009), the Southern Branch (SB), the Principal Branch (PB) and the Intermediate \n\nBranch (IB; see Figure 2.1, Garcia et al. 2009), each one of which follows its own deep channel (Mulder \n\net al. 2009). They return to join at 8,333\u00ba W and leave the Gulf of Cadiz towards the west Iberian margin \n\nand central north-Atlantic (Garcia et al. 2009).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 The temperature and salinity of three masses of water, NACW, MOW and NADW. The \n\npresence of the MOW, carrying slightly warmer and saltier water is clearly evident in the 600 to 1200 m \ndepth range (Hansen et al. 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.3. North Atlantic Deep Water  \n\n The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is formed in the high-latitude regions of the Atlantic \n\nOcean and incorporates upper Labrador Sea Water (uLSW), classical Labrador Sea Water (cLSW), \n\nB \n\nA \n\nMiddle Slope Profile \n\n (Fig. 2.3 B) \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 The Gulf of Cadiz slopes.

It is a cold (3 \u2013 8 \u00baC) and less saline (34.95 \u2013 35.5 \u2030) water mass that flows at depths > \n\n1500 m from the Greenland\u2013Norwegian Sea region towards the south. In the Gulf of Cadiz, the NADW \n\nis joined by part of the saltier but warmer MOW. This mixture flows southwards down the eastern part \n\nof the Atlantic Ocean (Knauss, 1978; see Figure 2.1 and 2.2). \n\n \n\n 2.2. SWIM Faults  \n\nThe morphology of the Gulf of Cadiz is largely controlled by the main tectonic processes in the \n\narea, namely the thrust faults (reverse faults) accommodated in the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge \n\n(GCAW) and the wrenching associated to the South West Iberian Margin (SWIM) fault system (Duarte \n\net al. 2011). In addition to the accretionary wedge, the thrust faults are also accommodated in other \n\nstructures as the Horseshoe Thrust Fault, the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault, Gorringe Bank and the Tagus \n\nAbyssal Plain (although this last one is out of the Gulf of Cadiz strict domain; see Figure 2.4; Rosas et \n\nal. 2012). \n\nThe SWIM lineaments are faults (the SWIM faults) corresponding to a set of WNW \u2013 ESE \n\ntrending, vertical right-lateral strike\u2013slip faults, in agreement to the observation and interpretation of \n\nseveral seismic profiles and swath bathymetry that cross cut these features (Rosas et al. 2009; Terrinha \n\net al. 2009, Zitellini et al. 2009; Duarte et al. 2011). These lineaments are described by six a hundred-\n\nkilometer long linear bathymetric expression and extend from the easternmost part of the GCAW until \n\nthe Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, south of the Gorringe submarine mountain (Gorringe Bank; see Figure \n\n2.4; Duarte et al. 2009; Rosas et al. 2012).  \n\nThe SWIM Fault Zone is located between the western and eastern ends of two well-established \n\nplate boundaries, the Gloria Fault and the Rif-Tell fault and forms the southern boundary of the main \n\nseismically and tectonically active area of the Gulf of Cadiz (Zitellini et al. 2009). The morphologic \n\nexpression of the SWIM faults corresponds to a continuous alignment of seafloor crests and troughs \n\n(valleys), corresponding to fold crests and fault traces in the Holocene sediments (Zitellini et al. 2009), \n\nsometimes exhibiting an en echelon geometrical disposition, and commonly punctuated by active mud \n\nvolcanoes within the domain of the Accretionary Wedge. This overall linear morphology is more salient \n\nboth in the Horseshoe Valley and close to the northern part of the GCAW front, where lineaments can \n\nbe followed almost continuously for more than 200 km (Duarte et al. 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe SWIM 1 fault (see Figure 2.4) exhibits an evident morphological expression in the \n\nHorseshoe Valley and intersects the wedge deformation front to the north of the Coral Patch Ridge. Its \n\ncontinuation to the east is less visible, although punctuated by mud volcanoes (Duarte et al. 2011). This \n\nfault exceeds 600 km, corresponds to a strike-slip fault and can be followed from the Gorringe bank \n\nsouthern flank to the Morocco shelf. In some fault segments to the North of the Coral Patch Ridge is \n\npossible to identify E-W-striking undulations with maximum lengths of about 8 km. These features \n\nshow an en \u00e9chelon pattern, which corresponds to oriented folds of the recent sedimentary cover, thus \n\nallowing the establishing of a dextral strike-slip movement (Rosas et al. 2009).  \n\nThe SWIM 2 fault (see Figure 2.4), intercepts a northern segment of the GCAW front in the \n\nproximity of the Sagres Valley. The morphological expression of the SWIM 2, within the thrust wedge \n\nto the east, is well marked by a slightly arched trough that splays in the same direction (Duarte et al. \n\n2011). \n\nThe SWIM 3 fault (see Figure 2.4), characterized by several elongated WNW\u2013ESE ridges, \n\ntroughs and slope breaks, cuts along the southern flank of the Coral Patch Ridge, crosses a small portion \n\nof the Seine Abyssal Plain to the east and intersects the GCAW deformation front (Duarte et al. 2011).\n\nFigure 2.4 - Simplified tectonic map of the Gulf of Cadiz area.

Black dots correspond to the location \nof known mud volcanoes (e.g.: Duarte et al. 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nChapter 3  \n\nStudy Areas \n\nThe mud volcanoes described in this work are organized in three main areas, according to their \n\ndepth and to their geographic settings: the El Arraiche Mud Volcano Field, the Carbonate Province and \n\nDeep Mud Volcano Field (Figure 3.1). Within the Carbonate Province several morphological features, \n\nhere designated as \u201cOther Features\u201d and that are not mud volcanoes, are described and discussed because \n\nthey host, or have hosted in the past, seepage-related processes. The geologic and biologic characteristics \n\nof the described features (mud volcanoes and other morphological features) was based solely on the \n\ninformation available from published scientific papers and cruise reports.  \n\nThe El Arraiche field encompasses several mud volcanoes (Al Idrissi, Fi\u00faza, Gemini, Mercator, \n\nLazarillo de Tornes and Kidd) in the shallow Moroccan margin (200 \u2013 600 m). The Carbonate Province, \n\npierced by several mud volcanoes (No Name, Anastasya, Pipoca, Tarsis, Mekn\u00e8s, Student, Ginsburg, \n\nYuma, Aveiro, Jesus Baraza, Shouen and Darwin) and other features (Channel West of Gibraltar Strait, \n\nVernadsky Ridge, Pen Duick Escarpment, Iberico, Formosa Ridge and Cadiz Channel), corresponds to \n\nan extensive bathymetric strip (600 \u2013 1200 m) along the Moroccan and Spanish margins. The deep-\n\nwater field (1200 \u2013 4000 m), mostly within the Portuguese margin, includes several of the most active \n\nmud volcanoes in the region (Captain Arutyunov, Sagres, Carlos Ribeiro, Bonjardim, Semenovich and \n\nPorto; G\u00e9nio et al. 2013; Figure 3.1 and 3.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\nPortuguese Margin \n\nWest of Gibraltar \n\nFigure 3.1 - Gulf of Cadiz showing the three study areas of this work.

Based on reflection seismic data it is also assumed that the SWIM faults \n\nare, most probably, sub-vertical faults, however in this work it is considered that the they can have a \n\nminimum dip angle of 45\u00ba. Therefore, any MV located at more than 10 km from the fault surface trace \n\nwill not considered as being related with the fault, and the MVs located at less than 10 km from the fault \n\nare considered as probably being related or controlled by this fault (Figure 3.3). The SWIM 3 fault was \n\nnot studied here in detail since the Semenovich mud volcano is the only one in the vicinity of this fault \n\nwith reported macrofauna data available. Nevertheless, this MV is at a distance greater than 10 km from \n\nthe SWIM 3 fault, while the other two (so far) known nearby mud volcanoes (e.g.: Soloviev and Carlos \n\nTeixeira; see Figure 3.1), which are at distances &lt;10 km, lack relevant available macrofauna \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\n3.1. El Arraiche Field  \n\nIn May 2002 the El Arraiche Mud Volcano field was discovered during the TTR 12 cruise in \n\nthe Moroccan Atlantic margin in the Gulf of Cadiz. It is constituted by eight mud volcanoes (Kidd, \n\nMercator, Al Idrissi, Fi\u00faza, Don Quichote, Lazarillo de Tornes, Gemini and Adamastor), six of them are \n\nstudied in this project (Figure 3.4). The mud volcanoes have variable size and shape just below the shelf \n\nedge, at a water depth from 200 to 700 m. Al Idrissi is the largest mud volcano, 255 m high and 5400 m \n\nin diameter. Don Quichote and Lazarillo de Tornes, are the smallest mud volcanoes, only about 25 m \n\nhigh (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). The mud volcanoes are situated \n\naround the ridges on top of normal faults, which constrain the rotated blocks (Figure 3.5; Van \n\nRensbergen et al. 2005b; Wehrman et al. 2011), bound by lystric faults (concave normal fault; Vandorpe \n\net al. 2014).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Schematic representation (cross section) of the criteria established to consider if a MV is related \nor not with a SWIM fault. \n\nS\nW\n\nIM\n F\n\na\nu\n\nlt\n \n\nMud Volcano not considered as \n\nrelated with the SWIM Fault \n\nMud Volcano considered as \n\nrelated with the SWIM Fault \n\nSea floor   \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe El Arraiche field is part of a larger cluster of mud volcanoes that lie within the GCAW. On \n\nregional seismic lines this distinction is clear (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). The El Arraiche mud \n\nvolcanoes, as other mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz, are long-lived structures thought to be related \n\nto the episodic migration of hydrocarbons. Its mud volcanic activity is estimated to have started 2.4 Ma \n\nago (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b; Wehrman et al. 2011) and occurred in several phases (Vandorpe et \n\nal. 2014). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Morphology of the El Arraiche mud volcano field (from Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b).

Al Idrissi  \n\nThe Al Idrissi Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2 and 3.4) discovered during the Cadipor cruise in \n\n2002 is the largest and the shallowest mud volcano in El Arraiche mud volcano field, situated just below \n\nthe shelf edge in water depths of about 420 m. It appears to be located on a westward plunging anticline \n\nflank, visible in the bathymetry and on the seismic data (see Figure 3.6; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, \n\n2005b). The MV is 225 m high, up to 5400 m wide at its base and 1500 m wide at the top, with 197 m \n\nwater depth at the top (Table 3.1; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, 2005b). It is almost circular at the base \n\nand has an eye-shaped crater at the top. The crater is up to 17 m deep at the western side, the eastern \n\npart is occupied by a central dome-shaped elevation; maximum 42 m above the crater floor and the \n\nflanks of the mud volcano are dominated by down slope mud flows (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Mercator \n\nThe Mercator Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) is an asymmetric mud volcano, about 141 m high \n\nat the southern side, 90 m high on the northern side and only 51 m high on the eastern side, discovered \n\nduring the Cadipor cruise in 2002. It has a maximum diameter of 2450 m at the base and 1100 m at its \n\ntop, at a water depth of 351 m at the top (see Table 3.1). In this case, the slope is characterized by \n\nconcentric steps rather than radial sediment flow deposits. The crater is very shallow, &lt;2 m, but the \n\ncentral dome is large, 38 m and forms the caldera of the mud volcano (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, \n\n2005b; Haffert et al. 2013). The MV is situated on the Moroccan continental margin, on an anticline (an \n\nantiform fold with oldest rocks at its core) formed by the halokinesis of a salt diapir (Figure 37; Haffert \n\net al. 2013).  \n\nThe MV is one of the shallowest mud volcanoes and differs significantly from the other mud \n\nvolcanoes by the high chloride enrichment of its pore water (Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a; Oliver \n\net al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011). The top of Mercator contains patches of disturbed sediments from \n\nwhich gas-venting is occasionally observed. Solitary corals (Caryophyllia sp.), accompanied by \n\nCidaridae echinoids and Onuphidae polychaetes (Hyalinoecia tubicola) are abundant at the central area \n\nof the crater (Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a; Oliver et al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011). Lucinoma \n\nasapheus was found live only at Mercator MV at a water depth of 358 m (Oliver et al. 2011). The \n\nwidespread presence of authigenic carbonates and also extensive Neptunea and Bathymodiolus \n\ngraveyards, usually within the crater of the mud volcanoes, suggest that this was a very active seepage \n\narea in the past (Oliver et al. 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 A: Detail of some features of the Gulf of the Cadiz.

Fi\u00faza  \n\nThe Fi\u00faza is a conic shaped Mud Volcano (Kenyon et al. 2003) discovered during the Cadipor \n\ncruise in 2002. It is located at the western termination of the Renard Ridge (see Figure 3.4) and possibly \n\nat the southern continuation of the collapsed depression that hosts the Mercator mud volcano, but no \n\nfaults could be traced in either direction to its location; in agreement with Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, \n\n2005b). The MV has a maximum height of 143 m, 2200 m wide at the base and has a flat top 750 m \n\nwide with a 27 m high central dome of and maximum 700 m wide, with 393 m water depth at the top of \n\nthe mud volcano (see Table 3.1; Kenyon et al. 2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, 2005b). It is \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\ncharacterized by a series of concentric rims with high backscatter mud flows extending down the flanks, \n\nand up to 1300 m from the crater (Figure 3.6; Kenyon et al. 2003).  \n\n \n\n3.1.4. Gemini  \n\nThe Gemini Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the Cadipor cruise in 2002, occurs \n\nsouth of the large fault escarpments at the sea floor that bound the southern flank of the Renard Ridge \n\n(see Figure 3.4), at a water depth of about 423 m at the top. It consists of two mud volcanoes in one \n\nlarge oval-shaped mud cone, separated by an almost NS trending faults (see Figure 3.4; Kenyon et al. \n\n2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). The entire mud volcano is up to 252 m high, 4100 m long to 2300 \n\nm wide at the base, the maximum diameter at the top of the eastern part (Gemini East) is 1300 m and \n\nthe maximum diameter of the western part (Gemini West) is 900 m (see Table 3.1). The summits of \n\nboth Gemini East and Gemini West consist of a flat crater area with a central dome of respectively 23 \n\nand 27 m above the flat crater area (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). The differentiation between the two \n\nsummits is visible, from about 80 m below the top of the mud volcano, as 400 m long and 20 m deep \n\ncreases (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a). The MV is also characterized by typical concentric rims and \n\nmud flows. Mud flows are especially large at the western side where they extend about 1800 m down \n\nthe slope (Kenyon et al. 2003).  \n\n \n\n3.1.5. Lazarillo de Tornes  \n\nThe Lazarillo de Tornes Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the Cadipor \n\ncruise in 2002, is located at the crest of fault blocks on top of the Renard Ridge, and together \n\nwith Don Quichote Mud Volcano constitutes the smallest mud volcanoes of the field. It is only \n\n500 m wide and 25 m high, at a water depth of about 494 m (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b; see \n\nTable 3.1).  \n\n \n\n3.1.6. Kidd \n\nThe Kidd Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 09 cruise in 1999, is situated on \n\ntop of the Vernadsky Ridge with the top of the volcano at a water depth of 502 m. The MV is \n\napproximately 4000 m in diameter and shows an asymmetrically shaped volcanic edifice, with a steep \n\nSE slope and a gently sloping NW flank. The base of the MV is at a depth of ca. 500 m and its top is at \n\nca. 420 m. It is approximately 4000 m wide and its height is situated between 60 and 160 m. The central \n\ncrater has an approximate diameter of 350 m with several concentric rings, defining its central part (Van \n\nRensbergen et al. 2005b; Kenyon et al. 2006; see Table 3.1). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 A: Schematic overview of the stratigraphic setting of the Vernardsky Ridge and Mercator MV showing the location of the salt diaper.

Mud Volcanoes  \n\n3.2.1.1. No Name  \n\nThe No Name mud volcano discovered during the TTR 09 cruise in 1999, is located between \n\nTTR MV and the Pen Duick Escapment area (see Figure 3.2), at a water depth of 598 m. This MV is \n\napproximately 5000 m in diameter, with 598 m water depth at the top of the mud volcano (Table 3.1; \n\nKenyon et al. 2000). \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2. Anastasya Area (off Tarsis)  \n\nThe Anastasya area is constituted by three mud volcanoes: Anastasya, Pipoca and Tarsis (see \n\nFigure 3.2 - A).  \n\nThe Anastasya mud volcano is the most prominent structure, an 80 m cone-shaped \n\nmound, 1500 m in diameter with its top at 452 m water depth. The regular cone shape of this mud \n\nvolcano is symmetrical with respect to its slopes. In the centre of the volcano is a small flat-topped, \n\ndome-like feature (about 350 m in diameter) with steep slopes. The Pipoca mud volcano is \n\nmorphologically similar to Anastasya, it presents a sub-rounded cone shaped feature with a maximum \n\ndiameter of 2100 m, a relief of 97 m and the summit occurs at 536 m water depth. On the southwestern \n\nslope of this mud volcano can be identified several lobes formed by successive mud flows. The Tarsis \n\nmud volcano, NW of Pipoca, occurs at 762 m water depth and is a low-relief mound surrounded by a \n\nring-shaped moat. Its diameter at the seabed is 900 m and its height is 60 m (Somoza et al. 2003). \n\n \n\n3.2.1.3. Mekn\u00e8s  \n\nThe Mekn\u00e8s Mud Volcano has a high backscatter central pear shaped crater at a water depth of \n\nabout 650 m and the base is at 710 m. The MV discovered during the TTR 14 cruise in 2004, is located \n\non the SWIM 1 fault (see Figure 3.1). It is 60 m high and its width is about 1000 m (see Table 3.1; \n\nKenyon et al. 2006; Mhammedi et al. 2008, 2010). According with Mhammedi et al. 2010 the main \n\nminerals of the MV are carbonates, calcite, dolomite and aragonite. (Kenyon et al. 2006). The crater of \n\nthe Mekn\u00e8s MV is formed by a large number of empty shells of the gastropod Neptunea and green mud \n\nbreccia with scattered clasts (Oliver et al. 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n3.2.1.4. Student  \n\nThe student mud volcano was discovery during the TTR 10 cruise in 2000 (Kenyon et al. 2001; \n\nsee Figure 3.2). It is 200 m high and it has a very sharp morphology, with a diameter of about 1700 m \n\nat its base and 200 m at the top, at a water depth at the top of about 955 m (see Table 3.1). This mud \n\nvolcano is delimited by a well-defined moat, particularly on the westernmost flank, where there are \n\nsmall features that are probably carbonate mounds (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008).  \n\n \n\n3.2.1.5. Ginsburg  \n\nThe Ginsburg Mud Volcano discovered in TTR 09 cruise in 1999 (Kenyon et al. 2000; Kenyon \n\net al. 2010; see Figure 3.2 - B), is located in the Western Moroccan Field in the Eastern domain of the \n\nOlistostrome and is probably one of the largest mud volcanoes in this area (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b; \n\nStadnitskaia et al. 2008). This conical shaped MV is over 250 m high, with a diameter of about 3800 m \n\nat the base and 400 m at the top, (see Table 3.1; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b; Akhmetzhanov et al. \n\n2008), at a water depth of about 911 m. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.6. Yuma \n\nThe Yuma Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 09 in 1999 (Kenyon et al. \n\n2000) is constituted by a large, approximately 4000 m in diameter, gently domed summit upon which a \n\nsmaller dome is located. It is a conical shaped mud volcano with approximately 250 m high, about 4500 \n\nm wide at the base and 2000 m at the top (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008). This mud volcano is located in \n\nthe southeastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, with a bathymetric relief of more than 200 m (Gardner, 2001; \n\nMurton and Biggs, 2003; Ovsyannikov et al. 2003) at a water depth of about 964 m (see Table 3.1). \n\n  \n\n3.2.1.7. Aveiro  \n\nThe Aveiro Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 12 cruise in 2002, is 1500 \n\nm wide and about 80 m high (Kenyon et al. 2003; Ivanov et al. 2010), at a water depth of 1065 m (see \n\nTable 3.1). Sediment samples were collected and subdivided into three intervals during the TTR 12: the \n\nupper interval, the middle interval and the lower interval. The upper one, 0 to 4 cm presents brown marl \n\nwith foraminifera. The middle interval, 4 to 91 cm is light gray homogeneous, bioturbated marl with \n\nforaminifera. The mud breccia is present in the lower interval, up to 0.5 \u2013 1 cm diameter with a clayey \n\nmatrix and a large number of sedimentary rock fragments (Kenyon et al. 2003).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n3.2.1.8. Jesus Baraza \n\nThe Jesus Baraza Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 10 cruise in 2010 \n\n(Kenyon et al. 2001) is an asymmetrical hill with an ellipsoidal top (Kenyon, 2003), located on the \n\nSWIM 2 fault in the Western Moroccan Field (WMF) at a water depth of about 1091 m. The asymmetry \n\nof the crater area results from the presence of another crater developing about 300 m to the south \n\n(Kenyon, 2003). The Eastern domain is characterized by mud volcanism and mud diapirism, which are \n\nstructurally controlled (inverse structures within a chaotic body - GCAW) and likely triggered by the \n\ntectonic forces related to the convergence of the African and the Eurasian plates (Stadnitskaia et al. \n\n2008). The MV is about 150 m high, the crater is 1600 m long and about 600 m wide (see Table 3.1; \n\nKenyon, 2003).  \n\n \n\n3.2.1.9. Shouen \n\nShouen MV is a conical shaped mud volcano located approximately 16 km to the WNW of the \n\nYuma MV and about 11 Km to the north of Darwin MV (see Figure 3.2 - B), with water depths at the \n\ntop of 1180 m and high backscatter. It was discovered during the TTR 16 cruise in 2006, and it is \n\napproximately 150 m high, with a diameter of about 1100 m at its base and 700 m at the top (see Table \n\n3.1). This crater shows scattered crusts, clasts, small dead colonies of scleractinean coral and numerous \n\nlife traces. During the TTR 16 cruise was observed a few soft corals and pandalidae shrimps, and were \n\ncollected samples that contained some worms (Siboglinidae and other polychaetes), cnidarians \n\n(Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa) and one bivalve. The Shouen MV has a similar morphology to Darwin MV \n\nand is also a site of active seepage (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008).  \n\n \n\n3.2.1.10. Darwin \n\nThe Darwin Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 16 in 2006 \n\n(Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008), is situated on the Moroccan continental margin, at a water depth of 1105 \n\nm. The MV is cone shaped and approximately 50 m in height. In the centre of the crater a patch of \n\nseafloor approximately 80 m in diameter is covered with a carbonate crust pavement that is broken up \n\nby a network of fissures. The individual carbonate slabs are up to 10 m in diameter and are often tilted \n\ncreating local escarpments of up to 0.5 m high (see Table 3.1; Vanneste et al. 2012). \n\nDarwin MV differs from the others in the Carbonate Province area because its crater is \n\ncompletely covered by large carbonate slabs and crusts. The fissures among the slabs and depressions \n\nwith scattered crust are filled with abundant shell hash of Bathymodiolus and Neptunea contraria (G\u00e9nio \n\net al. 2008; Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a) and occasionally small clumps of living Bathymodiolus \n\nmauritanicus (Von Cosel, 2002; Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a; Oliver et al. 2011; Rodrigues et \n\nal. 2011). Soft corals and other epifauna are occasionally present on the rocks and sediment surface \n\n(Genio et al. 2008). Discrete AOM hotspots have been observed at the rim of the crater, suggesting a \n\nrelocation of seep activity (Vanreusel et al. 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Other Features  \n\nIn this work besides the mud volcanoes, other morphologic features of tectonic origin were also \n\nstudied (e.g.: the Vernadsky Ridge, the Pen Duick Escarpment, the Formosa Ridge). In addition to these, \n\nwhitin and in the vicinity of the MOW channels, abundant macrofauna was observed and also sampled. \n\nThese features include the Iberico mud mound, the Cadiz Channel and the Channel west of Gibraltar. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.1. Channel West of Gibraltar Strait \n\nA large erosive channel is located west of the Camarinal Sill along the Gibraltar Strait exit. This \n\nchannel may be divided into two main zones in agreement with Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. 2012: The eastern \n\nzone (Figure 3.8) is approximately 3000 to 4000 m wide and has a relatively linear WSW trend until \n\nreaching basement highs. The western zone (see Figure 3.8) of the channel is about 6000 m wide and has \n\na sinusoidal shape with a SW trend until 35.770\u00ba N and 6.717\u00ba W, where it changes its trend towards the \n\nNW and narrows to approximately 4000 m (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. 2012; 2014). The channel changes to \n\na small depression towards NW being delimited by a contourite terrace to the NE and an associated huge \n\ncontourite levee to the SW. In the middle to distal part of the terrace there are other minor channels, \n\nerosional scour alignments, valleys and depositional features (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. 2012). The MOW \n\ncirculates along this channel being partially responsible for its morphological characteristics (see Figure \n\n2.1). \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2. Vernadsky Ridge \n\nThe Vernadsky Ridge is a sea floor ridge located in the El Arraiche mud volcano field, sub-\n\nparallel to the Renard ridge and has a steep fault escarpmentat their S flank (see Figure 34 and 37; Van \n\nRensbergen et al. 2005b; Wehrmann et al. 2011). It is located in water depths of about 700 m and \n\nstretches to the shelf edge (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b).  \n\nThe total amount of mounds and cold-water coral patches on this northern edge of the Vernadsky \n\nRidge can be estimated at 130. The central part of the Vernadsky Ridge consists also of a topographic \n\nheight, providing substrate for the settlement of benthic organisms. At the edges, mound like structures \n\nare recognized, which can be interpreted as small NW-SE orientated mound patches. They have a similar \n\nacoustic signature on seismic and sidescan sonar imagery as the mound-like structures at the northern \n\nedge of the Vernadsky Ridge (Foubert et al. 2008).  \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3. Pen Duick Escarpment Area \n\nThe Pen Duick Escarpment located within the El Arraiche mud volcano field, represents the \n\nsoutheastern branch of the Renard Ridge (Kenyon et al. 2003; Van Rooij et al. 2011; Wehrmann et al. \n\n2011; Mol et al. 2012) and it is separated from Gemini MV, by 1000 m wide moat feature (see Figure \n\n3.4; Wehrmann et al. 2011). It represents a NE-SW oriented fault-bounded (normal fault) cliff of 6 km \n\nlength and 80 to 125 m height (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a; Van Rooij et al. 2011; Wehrmann et al. \n\n2011) at a water depth of 525 m (Kenyon et al. 2003). Some studies using seismic profiles provide \n\nevidence for gas accumulation and features related to hydrocarbon (gas) seepage, across the Pen Duick \n\nEscarpment (Wehrmann et al. 2011).  \n\nOn top of the Pen Duick Escarpment 15 cold-water coral mounds were recognized. These \n\nmounds are conical to elongated features with an average elevation of 15 m above the surrounding \n\nseabed (e.g.: mound C; Cunha personal communication). The mounds are distributed in a water depth \n\nof 500 \u2013 600 m and reach up to 60 m in height and about 500 m in diameter at the mound base. The \n\ncorals and the macrofauna located in the mounds are under the influence of the North Atlantic Central \n\nWater, with a bottom current speed of 10 cm s-1 at 1 m off the seafloor (Mol et al. 2012) and with \n\nFigure 3.8 \u2013 Swath bathymetry at the exit of the Gibraltar Strait (modified from Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., \n\n2014). Red Lines \u2013 Delimit Northern and Southern parts of the Channel. \n\nBasemen\nt \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nseabottom water temperatures ranging from 10.7 up to 11.8 \u00b0C and a salinity range of 35.55 \u2013 35.65 \n\n(Van Rooij et al. 2011; Wehrmann et al. 2011).   \n\n \n\n3.2.2.4. Iberico \n\nThe Iberico (see Figure 3.2) is an 870 m deep and 165 m tall cone-shaped mud mound. This \n\nfeature is defined by an asymmetric profile with steep slopes of 22\u00ba-25\u00ba and 12\u00ba-15\u00ba at its southward and \n\nnorthward flank, respectively (Somoza et al. 2003; see Figure 3.2). \n\n \n\n3.2.2.5. Formosa Ridge \n\nThe Formosa Ridge (see Figure 3.2) is a diapiric ridge formed by the ascending movement of \n\nsalt/shale deposits of the olistostrome masses or deeper plastic units. The movement of these less dense \n\nunits is likely triggered by the tectonic transpressional setting related to the convergence of the African \n\nand the Eurasian plates (Magalh\u00e3es et al. 2012). \n\n \n\n3.2.2.6. Cadiz Channel \n\nThe Cadiz Channel is the largest and most important contourite channel. It has a total length of \n\n110 km and an orientation that varies from SE-NW to NE-SW. This submarine channel is subject to \n\nhigh current speeds and erosional processes (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. 2006; see Figure 3.2 and 3.9).   \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Deep Field  \n\n3.3.1. Captain Arutyunov \n\nCaptain Arutyunov is a cone-shaped Mud Volcano on a flat basin floor, discovered during the \n\nTTR 12 cruise in 2002 (Kenyon et al. 2003) at a water depth of 1324 m. This Mud Volcano is about 100 \n\nm high, 2000 m in diameter and has a 300 m wide circular crater at the top (see Table 3.1; Kenyon et \n\nal. 2003). It is located on one of the major SWIM lineaments (SWIM 2; see Figure 3.2), where the \n\nthickness of the accretionary prism is greatest (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006). The Captain Arutynov is \n\none of the most active mud volcanos in the Gulf of Cadiz (Niemann et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2009), \n\nis categorized as an example of extensive generation and transport of fluids, petroleum and hydrocarbon \n\ngases from deeply buried sediments (Nuzzo et al. 2009) and is the place where an unusual member of \n\nthe Callianassidae has been found (Dworschak and Cunha, 2007). The most conspicuous animals were \n\ncidarid echinoids clustered at the centre of the crater. Several samples taken at the top showed that the \n\ncentral area is rich in gas hydrates and is densely covered by aggregations of Siboglinum accompanied \n\nby buried thyasiridae bivalves and patches of abundant polychaetes and tanaidaceans (Dworschak and \n\nCunha, 2007).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 - Swath bathymetry of the central sector of the middle slope of the Gulf of Cadiz Contourite \n\nSystem, showing the main contourite channels, furrows and main diapiric ridges, with a NNE trend.

Sagres \n\nSagres Mud Volcano is the shallowest mud volcano discovered on the Portuguese margin (see \n\nFigure 3.2) during the TTR 17 cruise in 2008, at a water depth of 1554 m. It presents an asymmetric \n\nstructure with a steep flank on the SE and its crater, at a 1630 m water depth, coincides with an area of \n\nhigh backscattering. The MV is about 110 m high and 2700 m wide at its base (see Table 3.1), and \n\nbased on the seismic profile it appears to have been controlled by faulting (Ivanov et al. 2010).   \n\n \n\n3.3.3. Carlos Ribeiro \n\nThe Carlos Ribeiro Mud Volcano discovered during the TTR 10 cruise in 2000 (Kenyon et al. \n\n2001), is located on the deep Portuguese margin on the lower slope of the accretionary wedge at less \n\nthan 10 km of the SWIM 2 fault, at 2173 m below sea level (Vanneste et al. 2011, 2013; see Figure \n\n3.2). The MV is circular with a flat-top summit, extending approximately to 80 m in height and 1500 m \n\nin diameter (see Table 3.1; Pinheiro et al. 2003; Vanneste et al. 2011, 2013). The focus of activity (the \n\neye) of the Mud Volcano lies slightly to the north of its centre, and is surrounded by a series of concentric \n\nridges which build up the MV (Vanneste et al. 2011, 2013).  \n\nGas hydrates recovered from the sediment and methane concentrations measured on the Carlos \n\nRibeiro mud volcano are some of the highest from the Gulf of Cadiz (Hil\u00e1rio and Cunha, 2008). In spite \n\nof this, the methane emissions, into the overlying water column, are relatively low (0 \u2013 806 mmol m?2 \n\nyr?1), which has been attributed to low fluid flow velocities (0.4 \u2013 4 cm yr?1) coupled with efficient \n\nmicrobial methanotrophy (Vanneste et al. 2013) and as result of the retention of methane in the form of \n\nhydrates. Fluid flow activity focused at the eye of the MV, gradually decreases towards its periphery \n\nand shows only modest fluid expulsion activity, when compared to other MVs (Vanneste et al. 2011, \n\n2013). In the Carlos Ribeiro Mud Volcano the macrofauna is diverse on the flanks, and by contrast, the \n\ntop (2200 m) is almost devoid of macrofauna with the exception of scattered ophiuroids and Bobmarleya \n\ngadensis, which inhabit small depressions of the seafloor (Hil\u00e1rio and Cunha, 2008). \n\n \n\n3.3.4. Bonjardim \n\nThe Bonjardim Mud Volcano is located on the deep Portuguese margin (see Figure 3.2; \n\nPinheiro et al. 2003), on SWIM 1 lineament in a water depth of about 3060 m (Pinheiro et al. 2003; Van \n\nRensbergen et al. 2005b). This Mud Volcano was discovered during the TTR 10 cruise in 2000 (see \n\nTable 3.1; Kenyon et al. 2001; Pinheiro et al. 2003) and has approximately 2000 m in diameter and 150 \n\nm in high (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008) with a sea floor depression at the rim of the cone (Pinheiro et al. \n\n2003). The crater rim is well developed, enclosing the 800 m wide, very high backscatter crater domain. \n\nOn the southeastern end of the crater there is a small, elevated area about 150 m in diameter. The western \n\nflank of the Bonjardim mud volcano is cut by a NE-SW slope failure, over 1000 m long that appears to \n\nbe related to a particularly large mud flow (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008). The characteristic feature of the \n\nmud breccias from the Bonjardim MV is the presence of very thin cover of pelagic sediments which \n\nindicates that the sampling sites were located on relatively recent mud flows (Stadnitskaia et al. 2006). \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n3.3.5. Semenovich  \n\nThe Semenovich Mud Volcano, located on the deep Portuguese margin (still in the accretionary \n\nwedge; see Figure 3.1) was discovered during the TTR 15 cruise in 2005 at a water depth of 3200 m \n\napproximately (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2007; Table 3.1). It is one of the deepest mud volcanoes found in \n\nthe Deep Portuguese Mud Volcano field together with Porto, Bonjardim, Olenin and Carlos Ribeiro. \n\nThis MV is 70 m high, has two craters with high backscatter and sharp rims, and well defined mudflows \n\nthat are more developed to the northwest (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008). \n\n \n\n3.3.6. Porto \n\nThe Porto Mud Volcano is located at the deep Portuguese margin (see Figure 3.1; Blazewicz-\n\nPaszkowycz et al. 2011a), on SWIM 1 lineament, at the rim of the accretionary prism, in a water depth \n\nof about 3900 m (see Table 3.1; IFM-Geomar, 2006; Cunha et al. 2013). It was discovered during the \n\nTTR 15 cruise in 2005 (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2007) and has been until now, the deepest mud volcano \n\nknown so far from the Gulf of Cadiz (IFM-Geomar, 2006). The top of the Porto mud volcano is covered \n\nby a continuous field of clumps of 20 to 50 individuals of Spirobrachia tripeira and an undetermined \n\nnumber of adult and juvenile specimens of Polybrachia sp. These clumps are accompanied mainly by \n\nthe frenulate Lamellisabella denticulata, stalked hexactinellid sponges and crinoids (Hil\u00e1rio and Cunha, \n\n2008). \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \n\nData and Methods \n\nThe data used in this work was compiled from the most relevant bibliography on the fauna \n\nobserved in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes, including several recently published articles (Dworschak \n\nand Cunha 2007; G\u00e9nio et al. 2008, 2013; Hil\u00e1rio and Cunha 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008; Bla?ewicz-\n\nPaszkowycz et al. 2011a, 2011b; Oliver et al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011, 2013), which are presented \n\nin the main matrix of Appendix I \u2013 Table 1. The samples were obtained using different gears (e.g.: \n\nGravity Corer - GC, FLUFO Lander - FLUFO, USNEL Box Corer - USNEL, Multi Corer - MUC, \n\nGeology Dredge - GD, Kasten Corer - KC, BIGO Lander - BIGO, TV-Grab - Gr, Suction Sampler ROV \n\n- SUS, Push Corer ROV - PUC, NIOZ Box Corer \u2013 NIOZ; examples shown in Figure 4.1), depending \n\nnamely on the specific objectives of each campaign, on the geological nature of the sampled seafloor, \n\nand on the ship equipment availability. \n\n Using the ArcMap, the main component of the ArcGis (Geographic Information System) \n\nsoftware, a comprehensive geodatabase was created using ArcCatalog to store all the spatial and tabular \n\ndata (e.g.: biological data, geographic coordinates, depths, cruises, stations, gear, structures and SWIM \n\nbathymetry). The data was organized in layers: Feature Classes and Raster Dataset, which allowed to \n\ncreate the final maps.  All maps produced were projected using UTM Zone 29N coordinated system and \n\nWorld Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) Datum. \n\n \n\n4.1. Spatial analysis with ArcGIS  \n\nArcGis is a geographic information system software with the ArcMap as the main component. \n\nThe ArcMap is used primarily to view, edit, create, and analyse geospatial data. In this project, the \n\nArcMap is used as a geospatial data tool in order to find spatial relationships between geological and \n\nbiological data (as specified above), namely concerning the SWIM faults, the mud volcanoes and the \n\nbathymetry versus the macrofauna found in the study area, the Gulf of the Cadiz. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Examples of gear used to collect the samples analysed in this work.

Workflow of the ArcMap \n\n4.1.1.1. Geodatabase \n\nA personal geodatabase, named BioData, is created using ArcCatalog to store all the spatial and \n\ntabular data (e.g.: biological data, geographic coordinates, depths, cruises, stations, gear, structures, \n\nSWIM bathymetry; Figure 4.2). The integration of all data in this format, allows tables correlations and \n\nseveral spatial analyses in a very simple and efficient way. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1.1.2. Feature Classes and Raster Dataset  \n\nThe Feature Classes (a collection of geographic features with the same geometry type (such as \n\npoint, line, or polygon), attributes, and spatial reference, see ESRI website: http://www.esri.com/) can \n\nbe created through four primary ways, using ArcCatalog or the Catalog window, using the Create \n\nFeature Class geoprocessing tool (the method used in this project), saving the contents of a map layer \n\nin ArcMap and converting an external data source into a geodatabase feature class. When creating a \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 The main operation performed in ArcMap. \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nfeature class, it is possible to choose whether to create one that stores polygons, lines, points, annotation, \n\nmultipoint, multipatch or dimension features. All feature classes in a feature dataset must use the same \n\nspatial reference, which is defined when the feature dataset is created. The Raster Dataset represents \n\ngeographic features by dividing the geographical space into discrete square or rectangular cells laid out \n\nin a grid (e.g.: the SWIM bathymetry used to delimiter the SWIM lineaments). Each cell has a value \n\nthat is used to represent some characteristic of that location (ESRI website: http://www.esri.com/). \n\n \n\n4.1.1.3. Join Data and Final Maps  \n\nWhen the feature classes are defined, it is necessary to compile the data in the same table to \n\ncreate the maps.  \u201cJoin Data\u201d is a very important step to join all data in the same table (e.g.: heterotrophic \n\nand chemotrophic species, gears, and stations in the Biology feature class). This allows the selection and \n\ndisplay of the necessary attributes in the different maps. After the necessary attributes are selected, the \n\nsoftware superimposes the different layers (Feature Classes and Raster Dataset) and creates the final \n\nmaps (e.g.: Figure 3.1 and 3.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nChapter 5 \n\nResults \n\nThe biological samples studied in this work were taken from 22 mud volcanoes, six from the El \n\nArraiche Mud Volcano field, ten from the Carbonate Province and six from the Deep Field, and another \n\nsix features (not mud volcanoes) in the Carbonate Province (see Chapter 3). The features with a high \n\nlevel of sampling effort (Table 5.1) are Captain Arutyunov MV (19 stations), Mercator MV (12 stations) \n\nand Pen Duick Escarpment (ten stations). The type of gear more frequently used to collect the biological \n\nsamples were the TV-Grab (Gr) in thirty stations and the USNEL Box Corer (UB) in sixteen stations \n\n(see Table 5.1). \n\nIn total 122 species were analysed from 105 stations (Annex I - Table 1), 18 belong to the \n\nFamily Siboglinidae (Phylum Annelida, Class Polychaeta), 14 to the Class Bivalvia (Phylum Mollusca), \n\n56 to the Class Gastropoda (Phylum Mollusca), 17 to the Order Tanaidacea (Phylum Arthropoda, Sub-\n\nPhylum Crustacea, Class Malacostraca), one to the Order Decapoda (Phylum Arthropoda, Sub-Phylum \n\nCrustacea, Class Malacostraca) and 16 to the Class Ophiuroidea (Phylum Echinodermata; Table 5.2). \n\nThe Order Decapoda was not analysed like the other taxa since the available published data reports one \n\nfamily only (Callianassidae, Genus Vulcanocalliax, Species V. arutyunovi; Annex II \u2013 Figure 1) found \n\nin Captain Arutyunov MV at depths between 1327 and 1339 m. \n\nThe interpretation of the number of species per feature distribution shows that the number of \n\nchemotrophic species increases with the depth increment (Figure 5.1 - A). Two exceptions can be \n\nobserved, in the El Arraiche Field and in the \u201cOther Features\u201d from the Carbonate Province. Although \n\nthe Mercator MV is located at only 351 m depth, a high number of chemotrophic species (eight species) \n\nwas observed, when compared with other features from the El Arraiche Field, located at the same depth. \n\nIn the \u201cOther Features\u201d no chemotrophic species are observed, with the exception of the Pen Duick \n\nEscarpment (between 445 and 1275 m), where two thiotrophic species were found. The mud volcanoes \n\n(red rectangles in the Figure 5.1) that show a higher number of chemotrophic species are located at less \n\nthan 10 km relatively to the SWIM faults, with the exception of the Jesus Baraza MV where only one \n\nspecie was found. The predominant metabolic strategy in all analysed areas (\u201cOther Features\u201d, El \n\nArraiche Field, Carbonate Province and Deep Field) is the thiotrophic nutrition. On the other hand, the \n\nless utilized metabolic strategy is the Dual Symbiosis, only observed in species localized in Darwin MV. \n\nThe distribution of the heterotrophic species (Figure 5.1 - B) shows that the number of taxa \n\ntends to decrease with depth (76 species in the El Arraiche Field, 60 species in the Carbonate Province, \n\n36 species in the \u201cOther Features\u201d and 47 species in the Deep Field). Thus, a higher number of these \n\nspecies is observed in the El Arraiche Field than in the Deep Field. In both cases the majority of species \n\nbelong to the Class Gastropoda. In the \u201cOther Features\u201d the number of species is lower than expected \n\nfor these depths and also lower than in the Deep Field. In three of the six MV situated at less than 10 \n\nkm of the SWIM faults, a high number of heterotrophic organisms can be observed (Mekn\u00e8s, Captain \n\nArutyunov and Porto MV).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 - Number of samples taken with different types of gear in each feature.

Figure 5.4 shows the distribution of the \n\nremaining species of this taxon: Bobmarleya gadensis, Lamellisabella denticulata and Spirobrachia \n\ntripeira. The majority of species belonging to the genus Polybrachia are located in mud volcanoes from \n\nthe Deep Field (Carlos Ribeiro, Captain Arutyun, Sagres, Bonjardim, Porto and Semenovich). The only \n\nspecie of the Genus Polybrachia found outside the Deep Field is Polybrachia sp.1 (see Figure 5.2) that \n\noccurs in the Mercator MV. The species belonging to the Genus Siboglinum widespread throughout the \n\nstudy area (see Figure 5.3). Finally, the species Bobmarleya gadensis, Lamellisabella denticulata and \n\nSpirobrachia tripeira are observed only in the Deep Field, being restricted to the Carlos MV \n\n(Bobmarleya gadensis) and Porto MV (Lamellisabella denticulata and Spirobrachia tripeira), at less \n\nthan 10 km to the SWIM faults (see Figure 5.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cOther Features\u201d \n(600 to 1200 m) \n\n \n\nEl Arraiche Field \n\n(200 to 600 m) \n\nCarbonate Province MVs \n(600 to 1200 m) \n\nDeep Field \n\n(1200 to 4000 m) \n\nFeatures \n\nA \n\nB \n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr \n\no\nf \n\nS\np\n\ne\nc\nie\n\ns\n \n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Number of species per feature.

Class Bivalvia \n\nThe Class Bivalvia is represented by 14 species (ten genera in five families: Mytilidae, \n\nSolemyidae, Thyasiridae and Vesicomyidae; see Table 5.2; examples shown in Annex II - Figure 3 to \n\n8), three of these are heterotrophic (Figure 5.13, subchapter 5.2) and 11 chemotrophic (Figure 5.5, 5.6 \n\nand 5.7). Five of these species are singletons, Isorropodon sp. indeterminate, Spinaxinus cf. sentosus, \n\nLucinoma asapheus, Mendicula ferruginosa and Thyasira tortuosa. Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show the \n\ndistribution of the two families with more species (Solemyidae and Thyasiridae) and Figure 5.7 shows \n\nthe distribution of the remaining species. The species Acharax gadirae (Annex II \u2013 Figure 4) occurs in \n\na wide range of depths, 556 to 3860 m, contrasting with the species Solemya (Petrasma) elarraichensis \n\n(Annex II \u2013 Figure 4) that is restricted to lower depths, 358 to 1030 m, in the El Arriche Field, and \n\nCarbonate Province (see Figure 5.5). The species Spinaxinus cf. sentosus (blue dot; Annex II \u2013 Figure \n\n5) and Thyasira tortuosa (pink dot) only appear once and are both located in the Deep Field. Thyasira \n\n(Parathyasira) granulosa (green dots) appears in three different features, Shouen MV, Mekn\u00e8s MV \n\n(Carbonate Province) and Mercator MV (El Arraiche Field) at depths between 350 and 1177 m. The \n\nspecie Thyasira vulcolutre (red dots; Annex II \u2013 Figure 3) is located in the Depp Field (Carlos Ribeiro \n\nMV and Captain Arutyunov) at depths between 1221 and 2200 m. The last specie, Axinulus croulinensis \n\nwas found only in the Mercator Mud Volcano in El Arraiche Field (see Figure 5.6). Finally, the species \n\n\u201cBathymodiolus\u201d mauritanicus, Isorropodon megadesmus (Annex II \u2013 Figure 6), Isorropodon sp. \n\nindeterminate (Annex II \u2013 Figure 7) and Lucinoma asapheus (Annex II \u2013 Figure 5) are present in all \n\nareas at depths between 358 to 1323 m (see Figure 5.7).  \n\nWest of Gibraltar \n\nFormosa Ridge \n\nFigure 5.4 \u2013 Distribution of polychaetes.

Heterotrophic Organisms \n\n5.2.1. Order Tanaidacea \n\nThe Order Tanaidacea is represented by 17 species (13 genera in eight families; see Table 5.2; \n\nexamples shown in Annex II \u2013 Figure 9 to 16); four of them are singletons: Pseudosphyrapus, \n\nPseudosphyrapus sp. A (Annex II \u2013 Figure 16), Sphyrapus meknes (Annex II \u2013 Figure 16) and \n\nTorquella ib\u00e9rica (Annex II \u2013 Figure 11). Figure 5.8 shows the distribution of two Suborders, \n\nApseudomorpha and Tanaidomorpha. The Suborder Apseudomorpha (green dots) occurs in a wide \n\nrange of depths, 355 to 3061 m and it is present in all regions of the study area. On the other hand, the \n\nSuborder Tanaidomorpha (dark blue dots) only occurs in a lower range of depths, 355 to 1345 m, except \n\nfor one specie, Pseudotanais (Pseudotanais) tympanobaculum (Annex II \u2013 Figure 13) belonging to the \n\nfamily Pseudotanaidae that also occurs deeper (3061 m). \n\nWest of Gibraltar \n\nFormosa Ridge \n\nFigure 5.7 \u2013 Distribution of bivalves.

Class Ophiuroidea \n\nThe Class Ophiuroidea is represented by 16 species (ten genera in seven families; see Table \n\n5.2; examples shown in Annex II \u2013 Figure 17 to 21); five of them are singletones, Ophiacantha aristata \n\n(Annex II \u2013 Figure 17), Ophiopristis gadensis (Annex II \u2013 Figure 18), Ophiactis abyssicola (Annex \n\nII \u2013 Figure 19), Ophiomusium lymani, and Ophiura (Dictenophiura) carnea. Figure 5.9 shows the \n\ndistribution of the six families, Amphilepididae, Amphiuridae, Ophiacanthidae, Ophiactidae, \n\nOphiolepididae and Ophiuridae. These families are located at depths between 230 and 1390 m. The \n\nfamily Amphiuridae (blue dots) has a broader distribution, when compared with the other families and \n\nis present in 15 features (11 mud volcanoes).  \n\nFigure 5.8 - Distribution of tanaids.

Figures 5.10 and 5.11 show the distribution of two subclasses, Caenogastropoda and \n\nVetigastropoda, that are represented by several species and Figure 5.12 shows the distribution of the \n\nremaining subclasses: Heterobrachia, Neomphalina and Patellogastropoda. The subclass \n\nCaenogastropoda (Figure 5.10) has a heterogeneous distribution, it is present in all regions (El Arraiche \n\nField, Carbonate Province and Deep Field) and occurs in a wide range of depths, 350 to 3902 m. \n\nAlthough the subclass Vetigastropoda (Figure 5.11) is also present in all regions, it is mostly restricted \n\nto lower depths, 227 to 1390 m, occurring punctually also in Porto MV (3887 to 3902 m). The final map \n\nshows three subclasses in a lower range of depths, 379 to 1321 m. The subclass Heterobrachia (purple \n\ndots) has a wider distribution when compared with the other two subclasses, Neomphalina and \n\nPatellogastropoda. \n\nWest of Gibraltar \n\nFormosa Ridge \n\nFigure 5.9 \u2013 Distribution of ophiuroids.

Class Bivalvia \n\nThe three heterotrophic species belonging to the Class Bivalvia have different distributions (Figure \n\n5.13). The specie Leptaxinus minutus (green dots) is reported from three mud volcanoes, two in the Cabonate \n\nProvince (Darwin and Yuma) and one in the El Arraiche Field (Mercator), while the specie Mendicula \n\nferruginosa (dark blue dot) only appears in one mud volcano (Mercator). The specie Thyasira obsoleta (red \n\ndots) is reported, mostly from sites located at less than 10 km to the SWIM faults in the Deep Field. The \n\nexception is the occurrence of Thyasira obsoleta in the Mercator MV. This is the specie with the widest range \n\nof depths, 353 to 3860 m. \n\nWest of Gibraltar \n\nFormosa Ridge \n\nFigure 5.12 \u2013 Distribution of gastropods.

Strengths and Limitations of the data \n\n The biological samples studied in this work were collected during several campaigns in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz. The areas were sampled in accordance with the scientific objectives of these campaigns \n\nand ship operation capabilities, and therefore some features have a higher level of sampling effort \n\n(Captain Arutyunov MV - 19 stations, Mercator MV - 12 stations and Pen Duick Escarpment - ten \n\nstations) and others are represented by just one station (e.g.: Lazarillo de Tornes, Vernadsky Ridge, \n\nIberico, Student; Table 5.1). The Captain Arutyunov MV has a high level of sampling effort, since it is \n\none of the most active mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz (Niemann et al. 2006; Dworschak and Cunha, \n\n2007; Sommer et al. 2009; Cunha et al., 2013). On the other hand, the Pen Duick Escarpment area was \n\nextensively sampled during the study of corals in the framework of Microsystems and Moundforce \n\nprojects led by Belgian and Dutch teams (e.g.: Foubert et al. 2008; Van Rooij et al. 2011; Wehrmann et \n\nal. 2011). The Mercator MV is one of the largest mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz, located at shallow \n\ndepths, which facilitates accessibility and time spent to collect samples. The marked differences between \n\nthe sampling (1 to 19 stations) makes it difficult to proper compare the different sites. The number of \n\nspecies increases with the number of stations (see Figure 5.1 and Table 5.1). Only in the ideal situation \n\ncorresponding to a much similar sampling between the different sites, and to a similar identified number \n\nof specimens of all species, would it be possible to do a thorough detailed analysis of the species \n\ndistribution. \n\nIn the collection of biological samples different gears were used (Chapter 4), which allows \n\ncollecting diversified information, since the different equipment will harvest different types of \n\norganisms. Again, only in a situation in which the same type of equipment was to be used across the \n\nwhole Gulf of Cadiz, would it be possible and easier to statistically analyse the distribution of species \n\ncollected, and to do a more accurate study. However, on the other hand, this would probably signify a \n\nconsiderable lost of information regarding the detected marked diversity of species. \n\nThe species analysed in this work (122 species) are represented by chemotrophic organisms, 18 \n\nbelong to the Class Polychaeta (see Figure 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4) and 11 to the Class Bivalvia (see Figure \n\n5.5, 5.6 and 5.7), and heterotrophic organisms, 17 species belong to the Order Tanaidacea (see Figure \n\n5.8), 16 to the Class Ophiuroidea (see Figure 5.9), 56 to the Class Gastropoda (see Figure 5.10, 5.11 \n\nand 5.12) and three to the Class Bivalvia (Figure 5.13). Despite the high level of sampling effort and \n\nthe still in progress analysis of all collected organisms in campaigns, the discovery of 52 singletons \n\nspecies (43% of the total studied species, mostly in the Class Gastropoda) indicates the necessity of a \n\nhigher level of sampling effort in the future. \n\n \n\n6.2. Spatial and Bathymetric Distribution  \n\nThe mud volcanoes described in this work were organized in three main areas (see Figure 3.1): \n\nthe El Arraiche Mud Volcano Field (200 - 600 m), the Carbonate Province (600 - 1200 m) and Deep \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nMud Volcano Field (1200 - 4000 m). Within the Carbonate Province several morphological features, \n\nhere designated by \u201cOther Features\u201d and that are not mud volcanoes, were analysed. \n\nThe El Arraiche Field encompasses a high number of heterotrophic species and a lower number \n\nof chemotrophic species when compared with the other studied areas in the Gulf of Cadiz (see Figure \n\n5.1). On the other hand, the Deep Field has a lower number of heterotrophic species and a high number \n\nof chemotrophic species that rely on the more active fluid emission in this region. It has been found that \n\nthe number of the chemotrophic species increases with depth and the number of the heterotrophic species \n\ndecreases with depth. The exception is the Mercator MV located in the El Arraiche Field, since it has a \n\nhigh number of both heterotrophic and chemotrophic organisms. This can express some degree of bias \n\ndue to the high level of sampling effort in this mud volcano as mentioned above. In fact, the level of \n\nsampling effort was very important for the assessment of biodiversity: the features that were well \n\nsampled also show a good representation of heterotrophic species but this are not well represented in \n\nfeatures that were insufficiently sampled. \n\nObserving the \u201cOther Features\u201d species distribution (see Figure 5.1) the chemotrophic species \n\nwere only found in the Pen Duick Escarpment. In this case however, this is not due to different sampling \n\nefforts. As a matter of fact the Pen Duic Escarpment is a tectonic feature accommodating fluid and gas \n\nescape and accumulation in sediments (see decription in subchapter. 3.2.2.3), whereas the remaining \n\n\u201cOther features\u201d correspond to sedimentary and erosive features, or diapirs, where no methane migration \n\nand seepage is expected to occur.  \n\nThe Deep Field includes several of the most active mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz (Pinheiro \n\net al. 2003; Rodrigues et al. 2011; Cunha et al. 2013) and several of them (Captain Arutyunov, Carlos \n\nRibeiro, Bonjardim e Porto) are aligned along major crustal strike\u2013slip faults (SWIM faults) associated \n\nwith the African-Eurasian plate boundary (Duarte et al. 2011). As said before this is a place with a high \n\nnumber of chemotrophic species and this majority was found in Captain Arutyunov MV, Carlos Ribeiro \n\nMV, Bonjardim MV and Porto MV (see Figure 5.1). \n\nIn general, the higher concentrations of species in the Gulf of Cadiz occurs at low depths, 200 \n\nto 1200 m (see Figure 5.1, 6.1 and 6.2) and these are mostly located in the mud volcanoes (see Figure \n\n5.1). Comparing the deepest mud volcanoes: Porto (3900 m), Seemenovich (3200 m), Bonjardim (3060 \n\nm) and Carlos Ribeiro (2173 m) with the shallowest mud volcanoes: Al Idrissi (197 m), Fi\u00faza (393 m), \n\nMercator (351 m) and Gemini (423 m), we see that the number of species found in the four deepest and \n\nfour shallowest mud volcanoes is similarly low (except in Mercator MV), suggesting there is not a \n\nsignificant influence of the water depth on the number of species (see Figure 5.1). Nevertheless, this \n\ncan also be due to the different sampling effort in the mud volcanoes, since some mud volcanoes have \n\na higher sampling effort than others (1 to 12 stations; see Table 5.1). The highest number of \n\nheterotrophic and chemotrophic species was found in two mud volcanoes, Mercator and Captain \n\nArutyunov. Again this can be due to the higher level of sampling effort in these mud volcanoes (12 and \n\n19 stations, respectively) relatively to the sampling of the remaining mud volcanoes. The highest number \n\nof chemotrophic species can be also due the location of the Mercator MV, on an anticline formed by the \n\nhalokinesis of a salt diapir. According to Haffert et al. 2013, a direct relation between halokinesis and \n\nseepage of fluids and gases exists, which has also been frequently documented in other regions (e.g.: \n\nGulf of Mexico). The rising diapir fractures the overburden, thereby creating preferential pathways for \n\nthe fluid and gas to escape. The pathways reach very deep and lead along the flanks of the diaper, which \n\nallows fluids and gases to rise to the surface (Haffert et al. 2013). In turn, the highest number of \n\nchemotrophic species in the Captain Arutyunov MV can be due to the high concentration of methane \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nnear de surface (Hensen et al. 2007), which in Gulf of Cadiz normally occurs between 30 and 80 cm (or \n\nmore) below the seafloor (Niemann et al. 2006; Hensen et al. 2007).  \n\n \n\n6.3. Metabolic Strategy  \n\nThe heterotrophic species were found in most of the studied features of the Gulf of Cadiz (except \n\nin Semenovich MV; see Figure 5.1), as expected since they occur globally. In this work, the \n\nheterotrophic species are represented mainly by the Class Gastropoda (see Figure 5.1), although the \n\nPolychaetes and the Crustaceans are in general the best represented taxonomic groups, in accordance to \n\nCunha et al. 2013. The number of these species decreases with depth (see Figure 6.1) probably because \n\nthe available food also becomes scarcer. In relation to the chemotrophic species, the dominant nutritional \n\npathway is the thiotrophy (see Figure 5.1), with mixotrophy, methanotrophy emerging as secondary \n\nstrategies (Rodrigues et al. 2013). The thiotrophic species are in symbiosis with thiotrophic bacteria \n\nwhose metabolism depends on the oxidation of sulfide or sulfur with oxygen or nitrate (subchapter \n\n1.7). It occurs due to the high availability of sulfur in the form of sulfide or sulfur in the methane seepage \n\nareas of the Gulf of Cadiz. Therefore these species only occur in mud volcanoes (except Pen Duick \n\nEscarpment; see Figure 5.1). The methanotrophic species are only located in two mud volcanoes, \n\nMercator (351 m) and Captain Arutyunov (1324 m), which indicates that the biogeochemical system in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz is probably dominated by sulfur (see Figure 5.1).  \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz has a higher number of chemotrophic species when compared with other seep \n\nlocations in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Guinea  (e.g.: War\u00e9n and Bouchet, 2009; \n\nOliver et al. 2008, 2011), which suggests the Gulf of Cadiz has a favourable nutritional condition for \n\nchemotrophic species. \n\n \n\n6.4. Proximity to the SWIM Faults \n\nThe highest concentration of chemotrophic species occurs in mud volcanoes located on the \n\nSWIM 1 and SWIM 2 faults at water depths ? 1200 m (see Figure 5.1). This is suggestive of these faults \n\nacting as preferential fluid conduits, feeding those species. In general, the methane seeps are especially \n\ncommon and active at water depths of 500\u20131000 m, where temperature and pressure combine to \n\ndestabilize gas hydrates (Hester and Brewer, 2009), but in the Gulf of Cadiz this depth may be greater \n\ndue to the influence of the warmer Mediterranean Outflow Water (Niemann et al. 2006; Sommer et al. \n\n2009). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.1 \u2013 Heterotrophic species distribution in the Gulf of Cadiz (Purple dots). \n\nWest of Gibraltar \n\nWest of Gibraltar \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 \u2013 Chemotrophic species distribution in the Gulf of Cadiz.

The number of these \n\nspecies decreases with depth probably because the available food also becomes scarcer; \n\n3- The thiotrophy is the dominant nutritional pathway of the chemotrophic species. It occurs \n\ndue to the high availability of sulfur in the form of sulfide or sulfur in the methane seepage \n\nareas of the Gulf of Cadiz. Therefore these species only occur in mud volcanoes, except in \n\nPen Duick Escarpment;  \n\n \n\n4- The methanotrophic species are only located in two mud volcanoes, Mercator (351 m) and \n\nCaptain Arutyunov (1324 m), which indicates that the biogeochemical system in the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz is probably dominated by sulfur;  \n\n \n\n5- The highest concentration of chemotrophic species occur in mud volcanoes located on the \n\nSWIM 1 and SWIM 2 faults at water depths ? 1200 m. Thus suggesting that these faults act \n\nas preferential fluid conduits, feeding those species. In general, the methane seeps are \n\nespecially common and active at water depths of 500\u20131000 m, where temperature and \n\npressure combine to destabilize gas hydrates (Hester and Brewer, 2009), but in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz this depth may be greater due to the influence of the warmer Mediterranean Outflow \n\nWater (Niemann et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2009); \n\n \n\n6- The main limitation of this work is the difference of sampling effort existing between \n\nfeatures (one to 19 stations).  \n\n \n\n7.1. Future Work \n\n- Complete the data with the same number of stations for all features; \n\n- Identify the number of specimens in the collected samples for a more detailed statistics analysis; \n\n- Acquire direct observation of the seafloor for the biologic communities on video; \n\n- Use the same gear and sampling technique in all features; \n\n- Collect gas samples at the stations studied in this work. \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\nBibliographic References \n\nAlves J.M.R., Carton X. and Ambar I.
