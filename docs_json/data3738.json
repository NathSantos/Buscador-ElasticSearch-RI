It is made up of basic-\n\nintermediate rocks with a great diversity of structures, textures, and modal compositions, related \n\nto the specific evolutionary process in a magma chamber. 2D forward modeling of \n\nmagnetometric data, based on available aerial and newly obtained ground data integrated with \n\nin situ rock magnetic susceptibility measurements, were used to establish its geometry. The \n\nresults, even considering intrinsic drawbacks of magnetometric theoretical models, are \n\ncompatible with the geologic-based presumed intrusion geometry. In addition, the stratigraphic \n\nanalysis of compositional and textural variations, coupled with the structural and geometric \n\nfeatures, allowed the interpretation of its emplacement mechanism and thermal evolution. \n\nQuantitative textural analysis through crystal size distribution (CSD) of plagioclase crystals, \n\nthe spatial distribution pattern of structures, microtextures, granulation, and rock-types, \n\nevidenced the internal heterogeneities of this occurrence. An approximately 110 m top-to-floor \n\nexposure section reveals that its internal heterogeneity was caused by non-instantaneous \n\nsuccessive emplacement of three different magma injections. The textural analysis also reveals \n\nfine-grained crystals formed under different cooling paths, present in medium- to coarse-\n\ngrained rocks within the intrusion, next to sharp contacts between different rock compositions. \n\nThe contacts between different rocks are characterized by hybridization textures and by \n\nsignificant amounts of plumose granophyre-type and plumose plagioclase. The time lapse \n\nbetween consecutive pulses is responsible for a stepwise cooling-path, preservation of \n\nhybridization textures, and the development of almost rigid surfaces providing crystals \n\nalignment during magma flow. High-resolution Sr-isotopy data demonstrates a complex \n\nassembly history, possibly involving filter pressing of residual liquids, and pre-existent crystals \n\nbefore magma installation in coarse-grained rocks. It is also possible to recognize fewer \n\namounts of country-rocks assimilation, which decreases towards the intrusion\u2019s core and can \n\nbe associated with magma migration due to filter pressing processes. In the feeder zone, the \n\nevolution of emplacement was marked by an almost continuous decrease in wall-rock \n\nassimilation by the consecutive magma batches. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Limeira intrusion; 2D magnetometric modeling; crystal size distribution (CSD); \n\nemplacement model; Paran\u00e1 Magmatic Province.  \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nLino, L.M., 2018, Geometria e estratigrafia da intrus\u00e3o de Limeira (SP-Brasil) [Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nMestrado], S\u00e3o Paulo, Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, 85p. \n\nA intrus\u00e3o de Limeira \u00e9 uma ocorr\u00eancia associada aos basaltos continentais Mesozoicos da \n\nProv\u00edncia Magm\u00e1tica do Paran\u00e1, aflorando na regi\u00e3o leste do estado de S\u00e3o Paulo. Esta intrus\u00e3o \n\n\u00e9 composta por rochas b\u00e1sico-intermedi\u00e1rias que ocorrem com grande diversidade de \n\nestruturas, texturas e composi\u00e7\u00f5es modais, relacionados aos mecanismos evolutivos espec\u00edficos \n\ndesta c\u00e2mara. A modelagem magnetom\u00e9trica bidimensional, baseado em aerolevantamentos \n\ndispon\u00edveis e dados recentes obtidos em campo e integrados \u00e0s medidas de suscetibilidade \n\nmagn\u00e9tica em rocha, foram utilizados para estabelecer sua geometria. Os resultados, mesmo \n\nconsiderando as desvantagens intr\u00ednsecas te\u00f3ricas do m\u00e9todo, s\u00e3o compat\u00edveis com o modelo \n\ngeol\u00f3gico presumido para esta intrus\u00e3o.

A se\u00e7\u00e3o de aproximadamente 110 metros de topo-\n\na-base revela que sua heterogeneidade interna foi causada pela inje\u00e7\u00e3o sucessiva de pelo menos \n\ntr\u00eas pulsos magm\u00e1ticos. Atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise textural foram reconhecidos cristais de plagiocl\u00e1sio \n\nde granula\u00e7\u00e3o muito fina a fina presentes em rochas de granula\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia a grossa, formados \n\nem diferentes raz\u00f5es de resfriamento e pr\u00f3ximo ao contato abrupto entre rochas de diferentes \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00f5es. Estes contatos caracterizam zonas onde s\u00e3o reconhecidas texturas h\u00edbridas e s\u00e3o \n\nmarcados pela presen\u00e7a e abund\u00e2ncia de intercrescimentos granof\u00edricos do tipo plumoso e \n\nplagiocl\u00e1sios plumosos.

INTRODUCTION \n\n The Limeira intrusion (SP-Brazil) is a basic-intermediate occurrence associated to the \n\nParan\u00e1 Magmatic Province (PMP), which crops out into two quarries (Cavinatto and Basalto 4) \n\nand provides a well top-to-bottom exposition of the intrusion-forming rock-types. These \n\nexposures allows to examine atypical features, rarely seen in other analogous intrusions, such \n\nas (1) the preservation of structural relationship with host-rocks at the uppermost contact, (2) \n\nexpanded compositional variation, including since basaltic to rhyolitic rocks, as well as a \n\nsignificant late hydrothermal input, and (3) a significant variety of magmatic structures and \n\ntextures. In this sense, Lino (2015) and Lino et al. (2018) draw attention to its compositional, \n\nstructural and textural variability inwards, pointing in evidence a more complex emplacement- \n\nand magmatic-evolutionary model, rather than a single magma batch that evolved under the \n\nprocess of fractional crystallization, as it had been previously considered. Previous geological \n\nstudies give some support for a lopolithic-like intrusion form (e.g., Lino, 2015), and coupled \n\nwith the distribution of rock-types, structures, textures, and chemical compositions, these data \n\nare suggestive of a multiple stage emplacement. \n\nI.2. OBJECTIVES \n\n Evolutionary magmatic models of intrusive occurrences are strictly dependent on their \n\nfinal volumes, geometry variations during the emplacement process, magmatic accretionary \n\nrates, initial compositions, volatile content, and magma initial temperature. Even representing \n\nimportant information to the modeling of the magmatic process, the geometry (volume) and \n\nemplacement mechanisms of igneous intrusions are still a subject of interest. Due to its small \n\nsize and volume, as well as the singular mode of exposure, the Limeira intrusion becomes a \n\npreferential object of study when dealing with geometry and emplacement models, among the \n\nregional igneous intrusions from the Paran\u00e1 Magmatic Province. The main objectives of this \n\nresearch were to determine the main geometric features of Limeira intrusion through \n\ngeophysical modeling, as well as to establish its internal stratigraphy and petrographic facies \n\ndistribution in detail, providing a better background for the analysis of emplacement \n\nmechanisms and the magmatic evolution of this magma chamber. The achievement of these \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nobjectives was sectioned into two steps to simplify the approach, resulting in the principal \n\nsections of this dissertation, presented as scientific papers. Specifically, the main research aims \n\nwere: \n\n? Characterization of Limeira intrusion geometry, based on geophysical magnetometric \n\nmodeling; \n\n? Detailed characterization of the basic-intermediate rocks petrographic properties to \n\nproperly classify the occurring rock-types, as well as to define the internal stratigraphy \n\nof the intrusion; \n\n? Characterization of the main structural patterns and quantification of the main micro-\n\ntextural variation within this magma chamber; \n\n? Quantification of the grain-size distribution (CSD) and spatial distribution patterns \n\n(SDP) of plagioclase crystals; \n\n? The proposition of compatible models for emplacement, magmatic and thermal \n\nevolution of the intrusion. \n\nI.3. PRESENTATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE DISSERTATION \n\n The present dissertation results of a multidisciplinary approach applied to model the \n\ngeometric features as well as the emplacement mechanisms of Limeira intrusion. In this sense, \n\nit is presented a geophysical 2-D modeling based on ground- and aerial-magnetometric \n\nmeasurements, combined with quantitative textural analysis and geological aspects that put in \n\nrelief the main internal heterogeneities of the intrusion. This dissertation is constituted of five \n\nchapters, among them, two are presented in the form of scientific papers. The current Chapter \n\n(I) introduces the main topic and presents the aims of this work. Chapter II details the scientific \n\napproach and the methods carried out to achieve the research objectives. The Chapters III and \n\nIV present scientific manuscripts. The first, published in the Brazilian Journal of Geology, deals \n\nwith magnetometric analysis, 2-D modeling and their results, while the second deals with \n\nmicro-textural analysis, stratigraphy, and inferences on the emplacement and thermal evolution \n\nmodels, and is in final reviewing process to be submitted to an international journal. These \n\nchapters describe in some detail the intrusion regional setting and previous work, in this sense \n\nthey will not be repeated in this introduction. The last Chapter (V) summarizes, integrates and \n\ndiscusses the obtained results. \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER II \n\n\u201cNo great discovery was ever made \n\nwithout a bold guess\u201d Sir Isaac Newton \n\nII.1. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n In this research, the scientific approach followed classical methods applied for the \n\ninvestigation of intrusive igneous rocks, based mainly on previous geological and petrographic \n\nresults presented by Lino (2015). In short, geophysical surveys were carried out in the Cavinatto \n\nquarry and surrounds, considering the occurrence area of Limeira intrusion, as delimited by \n\nSeixas et al. (2015). Both magnetometric and some gravimetric data were obtained. At this step, \n\nrock-type classification followed those proposed by Faria (2008) and Lino (2015). \n\n After concluding the geophysical modeling, classical detailed geological and \n\npetrographical facies (Ulbrich et al., 2001) mapping were conducted, followed by petrographic \n\ncompositional and textural descriptions, quantitative textural analysis, and in situ plagioclase \n\nisotopic measurements. Whole-rock and mineral chemical analysis, including in situ \n\nplagioclase trace elements, were also obtained and considered during the research. They will \n\nbe presented elsewhere (Lino &amp; Vlach, in preparation), and are not considered in this \n\ndissertation. The laboratory work was performed mainly at the GeoAnalitica core facility, from \n\nthe IGc-USP. The Sr-isotope and trace elements analysis were carried out at the MITERAC \n\n(USA), conducted by MSc. Maria Isabel G. Arroyave. \n\n A somewhat more detailed description of the applied methods is given in chronological \n\nsequence, as follows: \n\nII.1.1. Geophysical data acquisition and treatments \n\n Total magnetic field (TMF) measurements were performed with two Proton Precession \n\nOverhauser Magnetometers (Gem System, models GSM-19), with coupled high-precision GPS \n\nsystems, in 516 field stations listed in the Appendix A. One of them was used for diurnal \n\nvariation measurements on a fixed station far from potential anthropogenic influence, while the \n\nother was used as the rover station. The average distance between two successive measurement \n\nstations was about 30 m (Figure 1). \n\n Magnetic susceptibility (MS) data were obtained for 57 rock samples. The \n\nmeasurements were made on regular surfaces or slices of fresh hand samples with portable \n\nequipment from GF Instruments. On the average, ten measurements were taken on each sample. \n\nIn the studied rocks, the MS values are directly correlated with the magnetite/Ti-magnetite \n\nmodal content. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n Data processing and treatment procedures are summarized in Figure 2 (see also \n\nCavallaro, 2013 and Milsom, 2003). The TMF values, registered on the base and rover stations, \n\nwere imported into the Geosoft\u00b4s Oasis Montaj\u00ae software and corrected for the diurnal \n\nmagnetic variations and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field, IGRF \n\n(http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/geomag/jsp/IGRF.jsp, accessed in May 2017) \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Image from Google Earth (accessed in May 2017) of the studied area. White arrows indicate the \n\nlocalization of Cavinatto and Basalto 4 quarries, spaced about 800 meters. Dotted lines represent measurement \n\nstations, and SP-330 is the Anhanguera Highway. \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Illustrative flowchart depicting the main magnetometric data acquisition and processing steps followed \n\nin this work. See text for more details. \n\n The final processing steps included data interpolation by the minimum curvature (MC) \n\nmethod (Briggs, 1974), analytical signal amplitude (ASA) filtering and the reduction to pole \n\n(RTP) systematics. The RTP systematics followed suggestions set out by Phillips (2007), \n\nconsidering the frequency domain, to highlight the main features and generate geophysical \n\nhttp://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/geomag/jsp/IGRF.jsp\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nmaps. The available aeromagnetometric data (CPRM, Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo Project 1039, carried out \n\n150 m high) was similarly treated in order to provide a comparison and better interpretation. \n\n The ASA filter may be used to detect the main edges and geometric features of \n\ngeological occurrences with significant magnetic contrast (e.g., Nabighian, 1972). With this \n\nprocedure, the horizontal and vertical gradients of the detected anomalous potential field \n\nnormally form a maximum and minimum pair of analytical signals; the former depicts the \n\nedges, while the latter highlights the center of the involved occurrences (Nabighian, 1984). \n\n In the case of 3D analysis, the ASA filter - which represents a horizontal plane \u2013 depends \n\non the inclination and declination directions of the target\u2019s magnetization and the geomagnetic \n\nfield; therefore the filter can be applied for edge estimation under some specific conditions (Li, \n\n2006). In this way, the ASA maximum is located over the causative body\u2019s edge only when it \n\noccurs at shallow deeps and can migrate with increasing depths to the center of the targets. \n\nAccording to the author, ASA filter works well for edge-detection, considering a prismatic \n\nmodel, when the ratio between the body top depth and its width is less than 0.1. \n\n Based on synthetics models, Ferreira et al. (2013) have shown that the ASA filter \n\neffectively depicts up the edges of geological occurrences with a constant thickness. The \n\nauthors have also demonstrated different methods for edge detection, based mainly on \n\ndirectional derivatives. The ASA filter is defined by the following equation 1, where M is total \n\nmagnetic anomalous field, and x, y, and z represents three-dimensional directions in the space. \n\n??? =  [ (\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n2\n+ (\n\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n2\n+  (\n\n??\n\n??\n)\n\n2\n\n]\n1/2\n\n                                       (1) \n\n The RTP systematics (Baranov, 1957) was applied to recalculate data intensity as well \n\nas to transpose the magnetic anomalous field (MAF) onto the geomagnetic pole reference, \n\nwhere the induced magnetization is in the vertical position. If the total magnetization direction \n\nis known (Kearey &amp; Brooks, 2002), it turns the induction polarization independent of the \n\ndirection of the geomagnetic field (Telford et al., 1976), by transforming the dipolar anomaly \n\ninto a monopolar one (e.g., Baranov, 1957; Nabighian, 1972, 1984). In the frequency domain, \n\nthe RTP systematics is defined by the following equation 2, where I is the magnetic inclination; \n\nD is magnetic declination, and Ia Is a correction parameter for the amplitude. \n\n?(?) =\n1\n\n[sin(??)+??cos(?)?cos (???)]\n2\n\n, ?? (|?? | &lt;|?|), ???? ?? = ?             (2) \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n The remnant magnetization affects the interpretation of magnetic anomalies and \n\ngenerates misinterpretation concerning targets shape and size (e.g., Cordani &amp; Shukowski, \n\n2009). The South Atlantic Anomaly (Hartmann &amp; Pacca, 2009), characterized by low magnetic \n\nintensities in southern America, results in a natural remnant magnetization more important than \n\nthe induced one. Thus, the theoretical response may be not compatible with the observed \n\nanomaly. The available paleomagnetic data (Ernesto et al., 1999) was used to correct, through \n\nconventional vectorial sum, the inclination and declination directions of the total magnetization. \n\nThe reference values used as well as the resulting total magnetization vector are summarized in \n\nTable 1, where the remnant (Jr) and induced (Ji) magnetizations can be expressed as the \n\nK\u00f6nigsberger ratio (Q = Jr/Ji). \n\nTable 1: Reference values of inclination and declination for induced and remnant magnetization vectors and the \n\ncomputed total magnetization vector. \n\nMagnetization direction Inclination (\u00ba) Declination (\u00baAz) \n\nInduced -35.89 -21.08 \n\nRemnant (Ernesto et al. 1999) -34.30 354.70 \n\nTotal magnetization vector -35.30 -13.10 \n\n2-D forward magnetic modeling was conducted from total anomaly profiles, exported \n\nfrom Geosoft, using the GRAVMAG software (Pedley et al., 1997). This software allows \n\nconstructing polygons with different forms and magnetic susceptibilities using measured data \n\nprofiles to create a theoretical anomaly, which could be successively refined to a best possible \n\nsolution. In this sense, a previous good geological framework is necessary to build any magnetic \n\ncoherent models (Pedley et al., 1997). \n\nII.1.2. Sampling and field work \n\n After a previous detailed geologic and petrographic characterization, we conducted a \n\nsystematic sampling of the main rock varieties within the Cavinatto quarry, considering modal \n\ncompositions, structures, textures, as well as the stratigraphic level. About 80 oriented samples, \n\nprecisely located with the aid of portable GPS and barometer, were collected for this work, \n\namong them, 30 were considered for detailed petrographic analysis. The localization of each \n\nsample within Cavinatto quarry are listed in the Appendix B. The orientation of ruptile \n\nstructures and rock-contacts were measured using a conventional compass. \n\nII.1.3. Modal measurements \n\n Conventional modal measurements were carried out over polished thin sections, by \n\npoint counting (Chayes, 1965), considering square grids with 2,000 points spaced by 0.2 mm \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nfor the fine-grained varieties, and 2,500 points spaced by 0.3 to 0.4 mm for medium- and coarse-\n\ngrained ones, respectively, over an area close to total thin-section. The associated standard \n\ndeviations were estimated from 4-5 coining blocks, constituted by 500 points each. \n\n Due to the occurrence of contrasting granophyre-types (intergrowths of K-feldspar and \n\nquartz) within and among samples, and considering that they can qualitatively record different \n\ncooling-rates during the late magmatic stage (Barker, 1970; Smith, 1974), we also attempted to \n\nquantify their diversity. Four main granophyre-types, occurring as isolated mesostasis between \n\nplagioclase and clinopyroxene crystals (i.e. Figure 3a), are present in our samples and can be \n\nclassified as: (1) plumose-, (2) radial-fringe, (3) vermicular-, and (4) cuneiform-types (Figure \n\n3b), indicating an increase in residence time, respectively. In each sample, 500 points on \n\naverage were counted, spaced by 0.1 mm over the granophyre areas. The relative modal \n\nabundance of quartz and alkali-feldspar were measured for the cuneiform granophyre-type \n\nintergrowth in four selected samples over optical microscopic images of ideal sections, resulting \n\nin an average of 47% (\u00b1 2 %) of quartz, and 53% (\u00b1 2 %) of alkali-feldspar. \n\nII.1.4. Textural analysis rationale, data acquisition, and treatment \n\n Plagioclase CSD analysis was conducted for 17 selected samples, from the edge to the \n\ncore of the intrusion. Crystals were drawn with the aid of Inkscape software, which allows \n\nobtaining vectorized images (Figure 3c, d). Samples with granulation up to 4.0 mm were \n\nphotographed under a 5-fold magnification petrographic microscope, under both plane \n\npolarized and cross-polarizer lights. Additionally, photomosaic and high-resolution scanned \n\nimages were also produced. Therefore, in order to generate reproducible CSD, at least ~200 \n\ncrystals are sufficient and were counted for coarse-grained samples and at least ~300 crystals \n\nfor fine-grained ones (Mock &amp; Jerram, 2005; Gualda, 2006). Volumetric proportion of \n\nplagioclase crystals were determined using CSD results and then compared to modal obtained \n\ndata, which resulted in maximum errors of \u00b10.5% (one sigma). For most samples, there was no \n\ndistinguishable fabric, except for the sample LIM-02, which was considered during \n\nstereological corrections. \n\n The treatment of ready-made images was made using the Image-J software (Abramoff \n\net al., 2004), to analyze crystals' shape and size distribution. It results in each location of the \n\ncrystal\u2019s centroid, the area of each crystal, orientation angle of the major axis in relation to the \n\nhorizontal, and size of the major and minor axes of the adjustment ellipse - with equal area. \n\nAnalyzed particles had sizes larger than 10 pixels, and the results were exported in CSD format. \n\nThe stereological correction processes were performed using the CSD slice spreadsheet, to \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nestimate the best plagioclase crystals 3-D shape (Morgan &amp; Jerram, 2006), and CSD-\n\nCorrections v 1.55 software was used to calculate CSD lines. In the next section, we briefly \n\ndescribe some important aspects of the CSD theory and the methods for the determination of \n\ncrystals spatial distribution patterns and alignment. \n\n \n\nFigure 3: a) Schematic drawings depicting the main types of granophyre intergrowth between K-feldspar and \n\nquartz, according to Smith (1974). b) Granophyre-types intergrowths occurring as mesostasis, interstitial to \n\nplagioclase crystals; note the predominance of radial-fringe type and some cuneiform-type, highlighted in red \n\n(Central Zone, Sample TF-36). c) Transmitted light image under crossed polarizers of a typical analyzed sample \n\nfrom the Limeira Intrusion (Bottom Intermediate zone, Sample IC-01).

Principles of CSD theory  \n\n Marsh (1988) and Cashman &amp; Marsh (1988) introduced and validated the Crystal Size \n\nDistribution (CSD) theory for a steady-state magmatic system based on previous work by \n\nRandolph &amp; Larsen (1971), which demonstrate the constant relation between crystal growth-\n\nrate and crystallization time in industrial crystal production processes. In short, there is a linear \n\ncorrelation between the natural logarithm of the crystal population density at a given crystal \n\nsize (L) of a mineral phase and the correspondent size, as described by the following equation \n\n3 (Marsh, 1988). \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n    ln(?) = ln(?0) ? (\n1\n\n??\n) ?                                                   (3) \n\nwhere n is the population density of crystals in a given size ?, ?0 is the final nucleation density \n\n(at ? =  0), ? is the effective growth rate (=  ??/??), and ? the effective residence time or \n\ncrystallization interval. The parameter ?? is intrinsic to the system, and corresponds to ???, the \n\nmean (or characteristic) length of crystals, considering since zero to infinite ? values in a \n\nstraight CSD distribution pattern. The nucleation rate of crystals (J) depends on the final \n\nnucleation density and the growth rate; it increases exponentially over time and is given by ? =\n\n(??(?0))?. The CSD line slope ? =  ?1/??  (= ?1/???) is inversely proportional to growth rate \n\nand residence time of crystals. \n\n The CSD model allows predicting dispersions from any of these parameters operating \n\nduring magma crystallization (Marsh, 1998; Zieg &amp; Marsh, 2002). Typical examples are \n\nillustrated in Figure 4, which highlights the effects over the standard model caused by \n\nincreasing nucleation density and residence time. The evolving paths of real magmatic \n\nchambers are more complex as compared with the predicted by the steady-state CDS theory, \n\nand the log-linear crystal size patterns are affected by changes in cooling- and growth-rates, as \n\nwell as crystal fractionation or mixing (Marsh, 1988; Burkhart et al., 1980; Marsh, 1998). For \n\ninstance, CSD line inflections, as represented in Figure 4d, could indicate system reheating \n\nthrough the emplacement of a new magma batch, leading to more than one cooling stage, or \n\nmagma mixing (Marsh, 1988; Cashman &amp; Marsh, 1988; Jerram et al. 2003). \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Schematic diagrams depicting a typical linear CSD pattern and the expected dispersions due to \n\ncrystallizing and mechanical related processes. a) CSD model of steady-state crystallization. b) Increasing \n\nnucleation density and crystallinity under constant residence time.

Spatial distribution patterns (SDP) \n\n As CSD\u2019s are related to the crystallization parameters of a magmatic system, the spatial \n\ndistribution patterns (SDP) and the shape preferred orientation (SPO) of crystals reflect physical \n\nmechanisms acting during magma emplacement and crystallization (e.g., Jerram &amp; Cheadle, \n\n2000). Jerram et al. (1996) developed a technique for determining the SDP parameter through \n\nthe cluster analysis, considering the relationship between crystal\u2019s centroid positions based on \n\nthe R-values, given by: \n\n? =\n??\n\n??\n=  \n\n1\n\n?\n??\n\n1\n\n???\n\n                                                        (4) \n\nwhere ?? and ??  are the ratios between the average nearest-neighbors in the sample and  that \n\nexpected for a random distribution with a same population density respectively; N is the number \n\nof crystal centroids, r the distance to the nearest neighbor, and NA the number of crystals per \n\nunit area in the random pattern. Accordantly, R-values =1, &lt;1 and > 1 indicates random, \n\nclustered and ordered point distributions, respectively. By calculating R-values from 2-D \n\nsections of 3-D random distributions of spheres with variable porosities, the authors were able \n\nto define a Random Sphere Distribution Line (RSDL), which allows identify real clustered and \n\nordered crystal distribution patterns in real rock frameworks. \n\n Cluster analysis can also be applied to quantify the packing process during the \n\ncrystallization of igneous rocks, and regions characterized by touching- and non-touching \n\nframeworks can be delimited in R-value vs. melt vol.% (or porosity vol.%) plots (Jerram et al., \n\n2003). As shown by Boorman et al. (2004), typical vectors for cluster variations trends expected \n\nfrom deformational compaction, overgrowth, and mechanical compaction processes can also \n\nbe drawn in such plots. \n\nII.1.4.3. Shape preferred orientation (SPO) of crystals  \n\n Crystal orientation in igneous rocks results from magmatic plastic deformation in a \n\nlaminar flux when the magma underwent a simple-, hyperbolic-, or a pure-shear flow (Turcotte \n\net al., 1987; Fialko &amp; Rubin, 1999; Higgns, 2006). The orientation ability depends on crystal \n\nshape and size, where no-equant crystals shapes register more efficiently shear directions (Iezzi \n\n&amp; Ventura 2002). The calculation of a mean orientation angle is a widespread routine used to \n\nestimate the preferred alignment direction of crystals (Capaccioni et al., 1997); however, this \n\nprocedure does not yield information about data dispersion. The length of the orientation vector, \n\nobtained through the following equation 5, adds significance of mean angle orientation and can \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nbe tested in statistical tables (Swan &amp; Sandilands, 1995). Resultant vectors greater than 0.244, \n\nfor a 95% significance and n>50, can indicate a preferred orientation (Davis, 1986). As \n\ndemonstrated by Mock et al. (2003), the vector-length can validate the results of the mean \n\norientation angles when its values are greater than the threshold.  \n\n??? =\n1\n\n?\n?(? sin ?? )\n\n2 + (? cos ?? )\n2                                              (5) \n\n In the case of a more complex stratigraphic distribution, the crystals might present a \n\nslight dispersion in orientation. The variation of the vector-length is not linear, making difficult \n\nthe direct comparison of orientation results. In order to compare the alignment results through \n\na linear function, the former component can also be determined using the cosine-tensor \n\ndirection (T), associated to its first eigenvector (Launeau &amp; Cruden, 1998). The direction of the \n\ncosine-tensor can be calculated by equation 6, where n is the number of crystals and ? is the \n\norientation angle. \n\n? =\n1\n\n?\n|\n\n? sin(?? )\n2 ? sin(?? ) cos(?? )\n\n? sin(?? ) cos(?? ) ? cos(?? )\n2\n\n|                                       (6) \n\n Through this approach, the orientation dispersion is calculated from eigenvectors e1 and \n\ne2, in which a random distribution results in e1=e2=0.5, and a perfect alignment results in e1=1 \n\nand e2=0. From eigenvectors is possible to derivate the axes of orientation of the ellipse ratio \n\nas ? = ??1/?2, varying from one in massive rocks, to zero in perfectly foliated rocks. It is also \n\npossible to calculate the Alignment Factor (AF), as AF=2(?1 ? 0.5), with results ranging from \n\n0 to 1 (alternatively ranging from 0 to 100) for massive to completely foliated rocks. \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nII.1.5. Sr isotope ratios in plagioclase and ICSD plots \n\n Sr isotope analysis of plagioclase was performed by a Multi-Collector Inductively \n\nCoupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, with Laser Ablation sampling (LA-MC-ICP-MS) at the \n\nMid West Isotope and Trace Element Research Analytical Center (MITERAC), from the \n\nUniversity of Notre Dame - the USA. In situ analysis was carried out over thick (ca. 60 ?m) \n\npolished sections from three samples, representative of three main stratigraphic levels. \n\nMeasurements were made using a 150\u00b5m diameter laser beam and time to ablation of 60 \n\nseconds. Analytical conditions for measurements were conducted with the following set up, \n\nIrradiance: 1.49 GW/cm3, Fluence: 4.46 J/cm3, and Repetition rate: 5Hz. \n\n The analytical strategy and interference corrections over the Sr and Rb isotopes \n\nfollowed Ramos et al. (2004) and Paton et al. (2007). The isobaric interference of 87Rb over \n\n87Sr was corrected using 85Rb corrected signal intensities. A modern-day coral (MR) from the \n\nIndian Ocean (87Sr/86Sr = 0.70910?0.00003, ID-TIMS measurements, cf. Bizarro et al., 2003) \n\nwas used as the main reference; the average 87Sr/86Sr on MR obtained during our analysis was \n\n0.70915?0.00007 (2?, N=30). \n\n Initial 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios were computed considering 132 Ma. as the average age of \n\nthe intrusion and then integrated with the obtained CSD data following the procedures described \n\nby Morgan et al. (2007) to drawn ICSD-type plots. The location of each analytical spot was \n\ncalculated as a distance fraction from crystal core to rims and then normalized to the measured \n\ncrystal-sizes. After stereological corrections, the deviations on spot positions were estimated as \n\n\u00b1 50% of the beam diameter.  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER III \n\n2D MAGNETOMETRIC MODELING OF A BASIC-INTERMEDIATE INTRUSION \n\nGEOMETRY: GEOPHYSICAL AND GEOLOGICAL APPROACHES APPLIED TO \n\nTHE LIMEIRA INTRUSION, PARAN\u00c1 MAGMATIC PROVINCE (SP, BRAZIL) \n\nLino, L.M.; Cavallaro, F.A.; Vlach, S.R.F.; Coelho, D.C. \n\nArticle published by the Brazilian Journal of Geology \n\n(DOI: 10.1590/2317-4889201820180099) \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe Limeira Intrusion is an occurrence related to the Mesozoic continental flood basalts of \n\nParan\u00e1 Magmatic Province, cropping out at the eastern S\u00e3o Paulo state. It is made up of basic-\n\nintermediate rocks with a great diversity of structures, textures, and modal compositions, related \n\nto specific evolutionary process in a magma chamber. Previous geological and stratigraphic \n\nevidence suggests it has a lopolithic-like geometry rather than a conventional sill-like, assumed \n\nfor most regional similar occurrences. 2D forward modeling of magnetometric data, based on \n\navailable aerial and newly obtained ground data integrated with in situ rock magnetic \n\nsusceptibility measurements, were used to test such hypothesis. The results, even considering \n\nintrinsic drawbacks of magnetometric theoretical models, are compatible with the geologic-\n\nbased presumed intrusion geometry. The determination of intrusive bodies geometry is quite \n\nsignificant to explain their different emplacement mechanisms. In the case of Limeira intrusion, \n\nthe results suggest that the emplacement mechanism may occur, apparently, by inner-accretion \n\nof fresh magmatic pulses in its central region. Importantly, the magmatic evolution of lopolith-\n\nlike basic-intermediate intrusions may open the way for extensive differentiation processes, \n\nwith strong implications to petrology and metallogenesis. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Limeira Intrusion, Intrusion geometry, 2D magnetometric modeling, Lopolith, \n\nParan\u00e1 Magmatic Province \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nIII.1. INTRODUCTION \n\n The formation and geometry of igneous intrusions in the crust are still a subject of debate \n\nin the literature due to the diverse forms of occurrence and to a great amount of tectonic \n\nenvironments in which they occur. However, recently the formation and growth of igneous \n\nintrusions have been associated to the amalgamation of several tabular-like intrusions (Menand, \n\n2011). The simplicity, larger distribution and relatively small volumes as compared with \n\nbatholiths, turn tabular intrusions an object of preferential study when dealing with igneous \n\nbodies\u2019 emplacement and thermal evolution.  \n\n Geophysical modeling is an important tool, which allows defining the geometry of \n\nseveral geologic occurrences. The magnetometric method, despite being a relatively more \n\ncomplex potential one, is a very efficient technique in the detection of geological occurrences \n\nwith high magnetic susceptibility contrast in relation to their environments (e.g., Kearey &amp; \n\nBrooks, 2002). \n\n The magnetization intensity of a rock strongly depends on the modal volume and \n\nmagnetic characteristics of its minerals. For instance, magnetic anomalies produced by a 200 \n\nm3 body can be the same as those produced by a 2 km3 body, depending on its overall magnetic \n\nmineral content, while gravity anomalies are just related to density. This difference may lead to \n\nmisinterpretation when dealing with magnetic anomalies; however, there are ways to \n\ncircumvent this problem, based on well-designed previous geological models and the \n\nknowledge of the targets magnetic properties. \n\n The continental crust presents internal stratification associated with variations of the \n\nconstituting rocks physical properties, as so far indicated by geophysical data and theoretical \n\nmodels based on indirect observations. As well known, the crust is constituted, at least, by two \n\nmain layers, a deep one composed of mafic rocks (lower crust), and a shallow one of granitic \n\ncomposition (upper crust) (e.g., Rudnick &amp; Fountain, 1995). This type of stratification could \n\nnot be explained by considering only the emplacement of vertical intrusions. In fact, available \n\nseismic data reveal the occurrence of intrusive complexes made up of tabular intrusions at the \n\nbase of the continental crust, which could be likely mechanisms for the formation of different \n\ncrustal layers (Franke, 1992). \n\n The present work aims to provide geological and geophysical information about the \n\ngeometry of Limeira Intrusion, a tabular-like occurrence related to the Mesozoic Paran\u00e1 \n\nMagmatic Province (PMP), in southern Brazil. Although the province has been extensively \n\nstudied concerning its stratigraphy, petrography, elemental and isotope geochemistry, and \n\ngeochronology (e.g., Bellieni et al., 1984a; Ernesto &amp; Pacca, 1988; Piccrillo &amp; Melfi, 1988; \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nPeate, 1997; Gallagher and Hawkesworth, 1994; Nardy et al., 2003, and references therein), \n\nwhich allowed to draw several petrogenetic and tectonic models (e.g., Peate et al., 1992; Turner \n\n&amp; Hawkesworth, 1995; Peate &amp; Hawkesworth, 1996; Peate, 1997), there is still few detailed \n\ngeological and stratigraphic research emphasizing the physical and geometric aspects of \n\nindividual intrusions or lava flows. \n\n Previous semi-detail geophysical studies by Seixas et al. (2015) showed that the Limeira \n\nIntrusion has a more limited lateral spreading than previously considered. In addition, previous \n\ngeological studies give some support for a lopolithic-like intrusion form (e.g., Lino, 2015). \n\nHerein we present results obtained through a more detailed ground magnetometric survey, \n\ncoupled with geological and rock magnetic susceptibility data. \n\nIII.2. GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n\n The Paran\u00e1 Magmatic Province (PMP), southern Brazil, represents the most important \n\nMesozoic continental flood basalt expression, constituting the Serra Geral Formation, one of \n\nthe uppermost formations of the Paran\u00e1 Basin (Bryan &amp; Ernst 2008; Milani 2004). Over \n\n562.000 km3 of lavas (Frank et al. 2009) were erupted in a time span between ca. 133 and 119 \n\nMa (Br\u00fcckmann et al. 2014). \n\n The majority of lavas are tholeiitic basalts, associated with minor andesites, riodacites \n\nand rhyolites, these later representing only ca. 3% of the lava flows and occurring mainly in the \n\nsouthern Paran\u00e1 Basin area (Comin-Chiaramonti et al. 1988; Nardy et al. 2002). These lava \n\nflows comprise low-Ti geochemical types, which crop out in the base, while high-Ti varieties \n\nappear at the intermediate and the uppermost levels of lava sequences (Peate et al. 1992). \n\n The origin of the PMP is certainly related to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, \n\nthrough the process of lithospheric mantle melting under the influence of the Tristan da Cunha \n\nPlume (Peate et al. 1990; Hawkesworth et al. 1992; Turner &amp; Hawkesworth 1995; Peate et al. \n\n1999; Marques et al. 1999) or, alternatively, to heat accumulation under the Pangea \n\nSupercontinent (Hartmann 2014).   \n\n In the eastern area of the S\u00e3o Paulo State, the high-Ti PMP magmatism is characterized \n\nby tabular-shaped intrusions, such as dikes, sills, and laccoliths (Zal\u00e1n et al. 1986). Most dikes \n\nintrude basement rocks and form expressive dike swarms (Peate et al. 1992) while the \n\nemplacement of sub-horizontal tabular intrusions occurs mainly in sedimentary host \n\ndiscontinuities; estimated total thickness of such intrusions vary in general between 2 to 200 m \n\nbut may reach up to 1,000 m (Marques &amp; Ernesto 2004). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nIII.2.1.  Limeira Intrusion \n\n The Limeira intrusion is one among several PMP intrusions that crop out in the S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo State central-eastern area (Figure 5). It intrudes Permo-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, \n\nmainly sandstones and rhythmic siltstones, of the Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup (Faria 2008, Lino 2015). \n\nThe best fresh-rock expositions are found in the so-called Cavinatto, owner\u2019s family name, and \n\nBasalto 4 quarries. Soares (1985) was the first to recognize a huge intrusion at this region, \n\nnamed as the Limeira-Cosm\u00f3polis Sill. According to them, it would correspond to a tabular \n\nshaped intrusion, with almost 60 km of horizontal extension and 280 m of thickness, as \n\nsuggested from surface evidence and available drill holes. \n\n \n\nFigure 5: Geological Map of central-eastern S\u00e3o Paulo state (Brazil), showing Paran\u00e1 Basin stratigraphic Units, \n\nthe pre-Cambrian basement, and location of the study area. Rocks of the Tubar\u00e3o Supergroup (Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup) \n\nconstitute most of the country rocks for the intrusions related to PMP magmatism. Simplified from Perrota &amp; \n\nSalvador (2005). \n\n Several recent works, emphasizing petrological, geochemical, stratigraphical and \n\ngeophysical aspects, were conducted by Faria (2008), Oliveira &amp; Dantas (2008), Lino (2015) \n\nand Seixas et al. (2015) among others, and highlighted some features relatively uncommon to \n\nother intrusion analogs. One of us, SRFV, had pointed out the occurrence of typical stratiform-\n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nlike rocks at the medium- to deep-outcrops at the Cavinatto quarry, given by modal and textural \n\ncentimetric- to decimetric-thick igneous layering. \n\n The Limeira rock types include since aphanitic basalts and diabases, at the intrusion \n\nborders, coarse-grained monzodioritic to very coarse-grained quartz-monzodioritic rocks, \n\ninwards. Rhyolites/rhyodacites occur as late dikes, with mm- to cm-sized thickness, cutting \n\nacross monzodiorites and diabases and as cm-sized ocelli in the upper diabases. \n\n The main rocks are composed of plagioclase (An65-30), clinopyroxene (augite and \n\npigeonite), Fe-Ti oxides (ilmenite, magnetite), and some sulfides. Apatite is the main accessory \n\nmineral. Well-developed granophyric intergrowths, composed by alkali-feldspar and quartz, are \n\ntypical in the coarse-grained rocks mesostasis, amounting up to 23 % vol. Hydrothermal \n\nprocesses are evidenced by apophyllite-bearing late veins, interstitial low-temperature minerals \n\nprecipitation, and substitution reactions affecting the primary mineral phases (Faria 2008; Lino \n\n2015).  \n\n Both Faria (2008) and Oliveira &amp; Dantas (2008) noted the intrusion\u2019s bottom edge \n\nexposed at the Basalto 4 quarry site and proposed that it becomes thinner to the southeast. Based \n\non ground magnetometric survey and analytical signal amplitude profiles, Seixas et al. (2015) \n\nsuggest that there are two independent intrusions in the Limeira area rather than a single sill: \n\nthe first corresponds to the Limeira Intrusion itself, while the second (exposed at the \n\nSert\u00e3ozinho quarry) is another intrusion located in the southern area of Limeira city. \n\nIII.2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nIII.2.1. The geologic suggested model \n\nThe Cavinatto quarry presents the best exposition of the Limeira Intrusion, currently \n\nexposing a vertical section with ca. 110 m deep in its southern and ca. 90m in the northern \n\nsides. The intrusion has a sub-horizontal roof, which becomes stepped towards the NW area. \n\nThe exposed basic-intermediate rocks show a great diversity of structures, textures, and modal \n\ncompositions. The most typical types may be grouped in aphanitic basalts, diabases, \n\nmonzodiories, and quartz-monzodiorites. Petrographic and geochemical details of the main \n\nrock types, as well as chemical compositions of the rock-forming minerals details,  can be found \n\nin Faria (2008) and Lino (2015). A brief general characterization is presented in the following. \n\nThe aphanitic varieties (1.0-1.3 m thick) probably accompany all intrusion contours. \n\nThey are made of massive thin chilled margins in contact with thermally metamorphosed \n\nsedimentary rocks, and aphanitic basic rocks, which may show some hydrothermal alteration \n\ndue to interaction with the H2O-bearing host rocks. As granulation increases progressively \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\ninwards, the rock became a diabase, with a phaneritic texture and structures that change from \n\namygdaloidal to massive inwards. The later crops out from ca. 1.3 m to ca. 20 m deep.  \n\nClinopyroxene monzodiorites occur from ca. 20 m to 60 m deep; their contacts with the \n\noverlaying diabases are usually sharp. They are very heterogeneous coarse-grained rocks, \n\nsometimes with a \u201cjaguar-skin\u201d aspect given by the irregular distribution of the mafic and felsic \n\nminerals. Felsic pods do contain typical granophyric intergrowths. Granulation increases \n\ndownwards while the mafic content decreases. \n\nClinopyroxene quartz-monzodiorites occur from ca. 60 m to 90 m deep; they are \n\nheterogeneous coarse- to very coarse-grained rocks with a cm-sized thin prismatic crystal of \n\npyroxene, and well developed - sometimes platy - magnetite crystals, which imprints a grid-\n\nlike texture over a similar \u201cjaguar-skin\u201d aspect. Their contacts with the monzodiorites appear \n\nto be gradational. \n\nTo the deepest levels exposed within the quarry, rock granulation decreases and \n\ncompositions become again monzodioritic. These rocks are the ones characterized by rhythmic \n\nrelatively mafic- and felsic-rich layers with subhorizontal dips. Importantly, they occur only on \n\nthe eastern and southern quarry walls. \n\nThe average SM values obtained for these rocks are presented in Table 3. The basic-\n\nintermediate rocks present an average value about 44.5 x10-3 (SI), while the sedimentary host \n\nrocks show, as expected, a much lower one, about 0.219 x10-3 (SI). Among the formers, the \n\naphanitic basalts, the monzodiorites, and the quartz-monzodiorites present also very contrasted \n\naverages values (from 80 to ~45 and 25 x10-3 SI, respectively), in accordance with their Ti-\n\nmagnetite/magnetite modal contents. \n\nTable 2: Magnetic susceptibility (x10-3 SI) and average modal composition of opaque phases (mainly Ti-\n\nmagnetite/magnetite and ilmenite) within the measured samples representative of the main rock types exposed in \n\nthe Limeira Intrusion. \n\nRock type \nChilled \n\nMargin \nDiabase \n\nMonzodiorite \n\n(uppermost) \n\nMonzodiorite \n\n(lowermost) \n\nQuartz-\n\nMonzodiorite \n\nHost \n\nRocks \n\nAverage \n\nSusceptibility \n\n(SI x 10-3) \n\n80 65 50 38 25 0.219 \n\n%Modal of \n\nopaque phases \n20 15 7.5 8 6 ~0 \n\n \n\n The following field observations suggest a lopolith- rather than sill- or laccolith-like \n\nintrusion geometry as presented in Figure 6 (see also Lino, 2015): \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n1. part of northern contact with the enclosing siltstones is sub-vertical down to, at least 30-\n\n40 m deep, as revealed by prospecting drill holes in country rocks; \n\n2. structural emplacement evidence observed along the intrusion suggest it thins towards \n\nthe northwest, east, and southeast; \n\n3. the exposed layered sequences did not present the expected lateral distribution. They \n\nappear to constitute more or less concentric, localized, layers. \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Schematic (N110E) geological cross section through Limeira intrusion, showing the distribution of the \n\nmain rock-types, and the localization of the quarries. The figure illustrates the geometry of the intrusion based on \n\nthe interpretation of field observations.  \n\nIII.2.2. Geophysical analysis \n\n Geophysical results are presented as magnetic anomaly maps for ground and aerial \n\nsurveys, and the final 2D forward modeling, as follows. \n\nIII.2.2.1. Magnetic anomaly maps \n\n The total magnetic anomaly maps are presented in Figure 7. They show similar positive \n\nand negative anomalies, as expected for targets located at this magnetic latitude - with \n\npredominant induced magnetization - pointing to a dipole over the Cavinatto and Basalto 4 \n\nquarries, which defines the probable horizontal occurrence of the intrusion. The main observed \n\ndifferences between the ground- and aerial-based maps are the dipole layout, reflecting \n\ncontrasted data acquisition systematics, and the anomalies intensities, which result from distinct \n\nvertical distances between the measurements and the target in each case. \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Total anomalous magnetic field (nT) maps for the Limeira Intrusion based on our ground survey (i) and \n\nthe available aerial data (ii). The locations of the Cavinatto and Basalto 4 quarries and the AB suggested geologic \n\ncross section (Figure 6) are indicated. Note the dipolar anomaly centered over the quarries in both maps and the \n\ndifference range between the anomalous field intensities. \n\n The derived analytical signal amplitude (ASA) maps are depicted in Figure 8. Of note, \n\nits application is valid in our case, with a favorable ratio between top depth (~20 m, based on \n\nfield observations) and the expected width of Limeira intrusion (>1,000 m, based on quarries \n\nlocation). So the use of both ground- and aerial-based maps, with different data distribution, \n\nallows to better delimit the possible limits of the intrusion. The terrestrial data presents better \n\nresolution and maximum ASA values twice as high as the aerial data due to the target proximity; \n\non the other hand, the aerial data is cleaner from possible anthropic interferences. Their \n\ncombination allows suggesting the intrusion limits quite well on the basis of the maximum \n\nsignal, as depicted in Figure 8. \n\n The RTP obtained maps (Figure 9) depict anomaly geometric features and their peek \n\ndistributions, which are again similar in the ground- and aerial-based maps. In fact, they give \n\nthe same response: two main high anomalies, aligned with the Cavinatto - Basalto 4 quarries \n\ntie line and a relative low anomaly between them. These lower values reflect, most probably, \n\nthe lack of data over the area in both surveys. \n\n In both cases, the positive anomaly is restricted to the most probable intrusion location. \n\nHigh anomaly variation gradients are observed close to the northern intrusion limits while \n\nrelatively low gradients appear towards the southern limits. At first principles, the former \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nsuggests a high dipping contact while the latter suggests a gradual lateral variation of the \n\nintrusion thickness. \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Analytical Signal Amplitude (ASA, nT/m) maps for the Limeira Intrusion, based on MAF data of ground \n\nsurvey (i) and the available aerial data (ii). Note that the ground data highlights two main regions with high ASA \n\nvalues, while aerial data (more defocused) presents an additional high ASA to southern, related the raw data \n\nacquisition contrasted features (white dots). The black dotted line in (i) is our best-estimated intrusion limits based \n\non both maps. \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Reduced to Pole (RTP, in nT) maps for the Limeira intrusion, based on MAF to ground survey (i) and \n\navailable aerial data (ii). Note the high anomaly over the quarries. The AB, CD and EF profiles correspond to \n\ntotal anomaly sections, extracted for the two-dimensional modeling. White dots represent the localization of data \n\nacquisition. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nIII.2.2.2. Magnetometric forward modeling \n\n The RTP values derived from the ground survey were used to estimate the 2D intrusion \n\ngeometry along the three main profiles shown in Figure 9. For simplicity and easiness of data \n\ntreatment, this model considers an average value for the magnetic susceptibility [44.5 (10-3 SI)], \n\nwhich appears to not affect substantially the overall model. The AB profile runs along the \n\nunique geological section available, while the CD and EF profiles run along the regions with \n\nmost ground magnetometric measurements. \n\n The presented geophysical model considers that the top depth approaches 20 m \n\nthickness, as estimated from measurements in some locations next to Cavinatto quarry. Results \n\nare depicted in Figure 10, which presents, among the 2D theoretical possible models, the total \n\nanomaly model that best fits with our geological data, along these profiles. In fact, as drawn in \n\nFigure 8, calculated and observed total magnetic anomalies match very well; minor \n\ndiscrepancies, especially in the central zone of the A-B profile, are probably related to the lack \n\nof ground measurement stations, leading to less accurate interpolation. The differences between \n\nthe observed and calculated anomalies, at the beginning and end of the CD and EF profiles, \n\nmost probably, result from border effects. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10: Schematic two-dimensional magnetic model of Limeira intrusion, based on the presumed geologic \n\nmodel, total magnetic anomalies (at AB, CD and EF profiles) and magnetic average susceptibility measurements. \n\nSee text for discussion. \n\nIII.3. CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\n The integration of ground and aerial magnetic data, geological information and \n\nmagnetic susceptibility measurements in rocks allowed set out an improved interpretation of \n\nthe lateral distribution and the 2D geometry of the Limeira Intrusion.  Our results suggest that \n\nthe intrusion has an elliptical shape, occupying a top area of about 2.5 to 3.0 km2 and its thickest \n\nzone corresponds to the quarries north portions. The modeled two-dimensional magnetometric \n\nprofiles support a lopolithic-like intrusion geometry very well, as previously suggested from \n\ngeologic evidence.  \n\n The model has some intrinsic limitations, however, and the main drawback comes from \n\nfield station distribution, which affects interpolation processes, as some relatively large areas \n\nwere not sampled due to exposure problems in relation to the location of the AB profile. On the \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nother hand, the removal of the sedimentary cover, allowing direct rock exposure, increases \n\nmagnetic anomalies, while the removal of rocky material - as in the extreme case of the \n\nCavinatto quarry - decreases the total volume of ferromagnetic minerals and, thus, the magnetic \n\nsignal intensity. These later effects cannot be properly quantified and corrected up to now and \n\nmay lead to some misinterpretation. \n\n The analysis of the two-dimensional profiles allows inferring some emplacement \n\nmechanisms for the Limeira intrusion. The profiles AB and EF suggest that the intrusion \n\nevolved, most probably, trough progressively emplacement of fresh magmatic pulses in the \n\ncentral zone of the magmatic chamber, causing its growth by the mechanism of inner-accretion \n\n(e.g., Menand, 2011). The north region coincides with the thicker zone of the intrusion and \n\nsupports the hypothesis that this may be the recharge area of the intrusion. \n\n The geometry and volume of the Limeira Intrusion opened ways for the development of \n\nseveral specific magmatic (e.g., magmatic recharge and differentiation) and post-magmatic \n\n(e.g., hydrothermal alteration) processes, turning it an interesting target for detailed petrological \n\nand metallogenetic studies. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nQUANTITATIVE TEXTURAL ANALYSIS AND Sr-ISOTOPY IN PLAGIOCLASE \n\nAPPLYING TO REVEAL EMPLACEMENT MECHANISM AND THERMAL \n\nEVOLUTION OF LIMEIRA INTRUSION, PARAN\u00c1 MAGMATIC PROVINCE, \n\nBRASIL \n\nLino, L.M.; Vlach, S.R.F. \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe stratigraphic analysis of compositional and textural variations, coupled with the structural \n\nand geometric features of an intrusive body related to Paran\u00e1 Magmatic Province, allowed the \n\ninterpretation of its emplacement mechanism and thermal evolution. Quantitative textural \n\nanalysis through crystal size distribution (CSD) of plagioclase crystals, the spatial distribution \n\npattern of structures, microtextures, granulation, and rock-types, evidenced the internal \n\nheterogeneities of this occurrence. In this paper, an approximately 110 m exposure section top-\n\nto-floor of Limeira intrusion (Brazil \u2013 SP) reveals that its internal heterogeneity was caused by \n\nnon-instantaneous successive emplacement of three different magma injections. The textural \n\nanalysis also reveals fine-grained crystals formed under different cooling paths, present in \n\nmedium- to coarse-grained rocks within the intrusion, next to sharp contacts between different \n\nrock compositions. These contacts are characterized by hybridization textures and are marked \n\nby large amounts of plumose granophyre-type and plumose plagioclase. The time lapse between \n\nconsecutive pulses is responsible for a stepwise cooling-path, characterized by very contrasting \n\neffective residence-times at each layer, preservation of hybridization textures, and the \n\ndevelopment of almost rigid surfaces providing crystals alignment and clustering during magma \n\nflow. The isotopic and textural data demonstrates a complex assembly history, in which the \n\nobtained split-size between mixed plagioclase populations at the Hybrid-Zones coincides with \n\nthe onset of Sr-isotope ratio increase, possibly involving filter pressing of residual liquids. We \n\nalso recognize pre-existent ante-crystals before magma installation only in coarse-grained \n\nrocks, probably formed in a different magma chamber. The recognition of successive magma \n\ninjections separated by a long period is a very important issue. It supports the models of tabular \n\nintrusion emplacement, formed by the amalgamation of sheet-like magma batches, and can be \n\nthe response for the distribution of different compositions and textures within Limeira intrusion. \n\nKeywords: crystal size distribution (CSD); spatial distribution patterns (SDP); emplacement \n\nmodel; Limeira intrusion; Paran\u00e1 Magmatic Province. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nIV.1. INTRODUCTION \n\n The formation and growth of igneous bodies exert considerable influence on the \n\ngeometry and the processes of the earth's crust creation. For a long time, it was believed that \n\nigneous intrusions, especially of granitic composition, were formed by instantaneous events, \n\nthrough the inflation of a single or a few magma pulses. Recently, a great diversity of models \n\nhave been created to explain the assembly, framework, and thermal evolution of several igneous \n\nbodies (Annen &amp; Sparks, 2002; Michaud &amp; Jaupart, 2006; Matzel et al., 2006; Menand, 2008; \n\nAnnen, 2011; Kavanagh et al., 2017). Based on laboratory models, geophysical, \n\ngeochronological, and geological evidence is currently known that small to large intrusions \n\nmight be formed by the amalgamation of several magma pulses, probably with sheet-like \n\ngeometries such as sills (Hawkes &amp; Hawkes, 1933; Cruden, 1998; Coleman et al., 2004; \n\nGlazner et al., 2004; Horsman et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2011).  \n\n Quantitative textural analysis (i.e. Crystal Size Distribution - CSD) in igneous rocks \n\naims to quantify crystals grain-size distribution, as well as its geometric arrangement, and helps \n\nto recover the evolutionary magmatic paths, principally to describe and quantify the acting \n\nmechanisms during its emplacement. As demonstrated by Zieg &amp; Marsh (2002), in a steady-\n\nstate system, the development of textures is marked by a progressive and predicted increase in \n\ngrain-size within an intrusive tabular-like body. However, the spatial arrangement of crystals is \n\nnot the result of simple crystallization. Crystal clustering and shape preferred orientation might \n\nresult of more complex mechanisms, as replenishments events, resulting in internal magma \n\nflows, and recycling of early crystal clusters (i.e. Mock et al., 2003; Jerram et al., 2003; Zieg \n\n&amp; Marsh, 2012). Furthermore, in situ isotopic ratios provide a well constrain of magmatic \n\nprocesses and evolution; and coupled with CSD analysis can result in time-lines of isotopic-\n\nratio evolution (Morgan et al., 2007). \n\n In this work, we present a detailed, and stratigraphically constrained, quantitative \n\ntextural analysis of plagioclase crystals, the spatial distribution patterns (SDP) of these crystals, \n\nin situ 87Sr/86Sri isotopic analysis, and a CSD-based thermal evolution model. We present \n\ngeological and textural aspects relatively uncommon in similar recent studies, aiming to \n\ndemonstrate the importance of the cooling path and the time interval between consecutive \n\npulses of magma, acting directly on the style of formation, growth, and geometry of magma \n\nchambers. Based on quantitative methods we present an emplacement model, which has \n\nimportant implications for the magmatic evolution and heat dynamics, especially for basic-\n\nintermediate tabular intrusions. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nIV.2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING \n\n The Limeira intrusion is a basic-intermediate occurrence related to Mesozoic flood-\n\nbasalts of Paran\u00e1 Magmatic Province (PMP). It is one among several tabular-shaped bodies \n\nemplaced on permocarboniferous sedimentary rocks of Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup, Tubar\u00e3o Supergroup \n\n(Figure 11), which crops out in the northeast portion of S\u00e3o Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. \n\nThese rocks are part of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, a large intracratonic sedimentary basin located in the \n\nsouth-central region of South-American continent, covering an area about 1,500,000 Km2. Its \n\nevolutionary late-stage processes are related to a distensive environment, responsible to the \n\ngeneration of the PMP flood basalts and the opening of Atlantic Ocean (Turner et al., 1994; \n\nMarques &amp; Ernesto, 2004; Ernesto et al. 2002, Milani, et al. 1992; Milani, 2004). \n\n \n\nFigure 11: Simplified geological map of the central-east portion of S\u00e3o Paulo state in southeastern Brazil, \n\ndepicting the main geological units and the location of the Limeira Intrusion (Modified from Perrota &amp; Salvador, \n\n2005). \n\nIV.2.1. Paran\u00e1 Magmatic Province  \n\n The PMP is one of the major continental basaltic manifestations of the world, formed \n\nby lava flows (ca. 450,000 km3) and intrusive occurrences (ca. 112,000 km3), which yielded ca. \n\n600,000 km3 of total volume. This province covers about 75% of the surface of the Paran\u00e1 \n\nBasin, in an area of approximately 917,000 km2 (Frank et al., 2009; Piccirillo et al., 1988a). \n\nClassical and more recent precise Ar40/Ar39 data argue that the vast majority of lava-flows were \n\nformed in a short time interval, varying from 1 to 3 Ma \u2013 between 134-131 Ma (Ernesto et al., \n\n1999; Thiede &amp; Vasconcelos, 2010). \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n The origin of such a vast magmatic province has long been related to lithospheric mantle \n\nmelting, under the influence of the Tristan da Cunha Plume (Peate et al., 1990,1999; \n\nHawkesworth et al. 1992; Tuner &amp; Hawkesworth, 1995; Marques et al. 1999; Ernesto et al. \n\n2002), or alternatively to the heat accumulation that occurred under the Pangea Supercontinent \n\n(Hartmann, 2014). Lava flows are mostly of the pahoehoe type (Waichel et al., 2006), and \n\ntholeiitic basalts are dominate, corresponding up to 90% in volume. Silicic rocks are majority \n\nrhyodacites and rhyolites that crop out in the upper flow piles, mainly at the central and southern \n\nprovince areas. The tholeiitic magmatism has long been subdivided into two main groups: low-\n\nTi (? 2 wt.% Ti) lava flows crop out at the base of the pile in the southern province areas, while \n\nhigh-Ti (> 2 wt.% Ti) varieties made up the intermediate and top lava flows, towards the north \n\n(e.g., Peate et al.,1990). \n\n The main intrusive bodies related to PMP constitute expressive dike-swarms, mainly \n\nalong the South America and African coasts, while sills and laccoliths, as part of the high-Ti \n\nmagmatism, are more frequent at eastern area of S\u00e3o Paulo state (Zal\u00e1n et al., 1986). The \n\nestimated thickness of such intrusions can range between 2 and 200m in general and can reach \n\nup to 1,000m in localities near to the depocenter of Paran\u00e1 Basin (Marques &amp; Ernesto, 2004). \n\nMost dike swarms intrude rocks from the crystalline basement, while tabular-like concordant \n\nintrusions emplaced at major discontinuities of the sedimentary pile (Peate et al., 1992). \n\nIV.1.2. Limeira Intrusion \n\n The Limeira intrusion was emplaced within sandstones and rhythmic siltstones of the \n\nItarar\u00e9 Subgroup (Permo-Carboniferous) and exhibits a great variety of rocks-types. Fresh \n\nrocks are exposed at Cavinatto and Basalto 4 quarries, where the first site exhibits the most \n\ncomplete rock exposure, given by a complete section from its upper contact until a depth of 110 \n\nmeters (Lino et al., 2018). These exposures allows to examine atypical features rarely seen in \n\nother analogous intrusions in other analogous intrusions, such as (1) the preservation of \n\nstructural relationship with host-rocks at the uppermost contact, (2) expanded compositional \n\nvariation, including since basaltic to rhyolitic rocks, as well as a significant late hydrothermal \n\ninput, and (3) a significant variety of magmatic structures and textures. \n\n Given these characteristics, it becomes an excellent target for the study of emplacement \n\nmechanisms and related magmatic processes in tabular-like intrusions. The intrusion was \n\nformerly being considered as a classical sill example (e.g., Soares, 1985; Faria, 2008). However, \n\nrecent detailed geological, petrographic and ground-/arerial-magnetometric data indicate that it \n\nconforms better a lopolith-like intrusion, probably formed by a number of individualized \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nmagma pulses (Lino et al., 2018). These authors also draw attention to its compositional, \n\nstructural and textural variability inwards, pointing in evidence a more complex magmatic \n\nevolutionary model. Geochemical and the Sr- and Nd-isotope data (Oliveira &amp; Dantas, 2008; \n\nFaria, 2008) had suggested that the intrusion evolved through fractional crystallization from a \n\nbasaltic primitive magma within a closed system, with some possible contamination from the \n\nsedimentary host rocks. \n\nIV.3. GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY \n\nIV.3.1. Host rocks and structural aspects  \n\n A virtually complete section of the Limeira intrusion crops out at the Cavinatto and \n\nBasalto 4 quarries, providing well exposures of different levels of the intrusive body. At the \n\nuppermost contact with the host rocks, fractures and ductile faults formed during the placement \n\nstage may be mapped to disclose information about its three-dimensional shape and its \n\nassembly process. The Limeira intrusion is emplaced within sandstones and rhythmic sediments \n\nof the Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup, which represent glaciogenic deposits. The sandstones presents cross-\n\nbedding stratification of metric dimensions (Figure 12a), with interbedded layers of minor clay \n\nminerals, occurring above the rhythmic siltstones and resulting in almost horizontal and flat \n\ncontact. Rhythmic siltstones are constituted of millimetric layers of fine-grained sands and silt, \n\nwhich occurs in shades of grey (Figure 12b), and its sub-horizontal stratification is parallel to \n\nthe contact with sandstones. \n\n The upper contact of the intrusion is almost concordant with sandstones, relatively flat, \n\nhorizontal and follows the former sedimentary contacts between sandstones and siltstones. \n\nConjugate fractures and faults systems suggest that solely the siltstones have been significantly \n\ndeformed during the intrusion emplacement. The NW-contact of the intrusion has an average \n\ndirection of 293.3\u00ba/50.2\u00ba, and conjugated faults occur with 113.4\u00ba/40\u00ba, resulting in horsts- and \n\ngrabens-like structures, which should have to accommodate the deformation introduced by the \n\nintrusive mechanism (Figure 12c). The strong relationship between these features is \n\nhighlighted in the stereological representation, presented in Figure 12c. \n\n At the northwest region of Cavinatto quarry, a high-angle fault oriented east-west and \n\ndipping 85\u00b0, displaces the sedimentary contact about 10-15 meters. A mafic dike with 6 meters \n\nthickness and 10 meters height fills in the fault plane and is interpreted as the main feeder zone \n\nof Limeira intrusion (Figure 12d). By comparing the dike and structures at this region, argued \n\nthat the main stress-field were sub-orthogonal to the faults orientation during the early stages \n\nof the emplacement process. It can also indicate a change in local-stress induced by the \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nsedimentary discontinuity, capable to redirect the propagation direction of its feeder dike, \n\nresulting in the magma infilling within this horizontal structure. \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Geological and structural features of the Limeira Intrusion at the Cavinatto quarry. a) Overlying \n\ncross-bedding sandstone at the northern limit the intrusion. b) Laminar plan-parallel stratification in overlying \n\nrhythmic siltstone. c) Emplacement-related faults cutting across rhythmic siltstone at the northern upper contact \n\n(dotted line) and stereographic projections of the main mapped structures. d) Basic feeder-dike emplaced in \n\nsubvertical fault, affecting sandstone and siltstone host-rocks. e) Siltstone xenoliths showing domino-fault \n\ndisplacement close to the upper contact, somewhat irregular but almost horizontal. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n Xenoliths of host-rocks are a less frequent feature on the upper-most part of the intrusion \n\nand made mainly of siltstone varieties. These xenoliths have centimetric to metric dimensions \n\nand are tabular-shaped; occurring horizontally displayed and locally presenting displacement \n\nof domino-type faults, along with the N-S direction (Figure 12e). The geometry and orientation \n\nof the displaced xenoliths are suggestive of an engulfing process during magma installation, in \n\na scenario of horizontal magma flux from north to south. \n\n The heating process at the upper contact generated a ca. 1 m thick metamorphic halo \n\nand the development of hornfels rocks. Previous petrographic analysis of siltite-hornfels \n\nsuggests that the metamorphic process does not efficiently affect the principal mineral phases. \n\nThe interaction with H2O-bearing host rocks is responsible for micro-fracturing, and the \n\ngeneration of quartz- and chlorite-rich veins and fluid-inclusions traces in quartz grains (Figure \n\n13a). It also apparently results in the crystallization of up to 0.1 mm sized andalusite \n\npseudomorphs, occurring only within millimetric clay-rich layers as rectangular-shaped \n\nsericitic agglomerates (Figure 13b). \n\n \nFigure 13: Thin section of rhythmic siltite hornfels, present in the northwest contact of Limeira intrusion. a) \n\nGeneral view exhibiting layers of different granulation. It is possible to observe the presence of a fine-grained \n\nsand, and distinctive types of venulations filled by quartz and/or chlorite with the possible hydrothermal origin, \n\nperpendicular to sedimentary stratification. The detail depicts quartz grains that contain fluid inclusions related \n\nto one of these veins. b) The detail in an argillic layer, where it is possible to observe tabular features, probably \n\nresulting in andalusite micro-crystals substitution. \n\nIV.3.2. Petrographic facies \n\n The mapped basic-intermediate rocks in the Limeira Intrusion were grouped according \n\nto petrographic facies (e.g., Ulbrich et al., 2001), characterized by their modal contents (Figure \n\n14), textures and structures, as well as their stratigraphic position within the intrusion, as \n\npresented in the following. The distribution pattern of the different rock compositions results \n\ninto three main groups. These groups represent rocks from the Upper Border Zone (UB), \n\nIntermediate zones \u2013 subdivided in an Upper Intermediate Zone (UIZ) and a Lower \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nIntermediate Zone (LIZ) - as well as the Central Zone (CZ), respectively (Figure 14). \n\nAccordingly, with rock structures and textures, five petrofacies were recognized from the \n\nintrusion borders towards the center. They include massive types, \u201cjaguar-skin\u201d types with \n\nmedium- to coarse-granulation, layered types, layered-like types imprinted over a grid-like \n\ntexture, and grid-like facies.  \n\n The UB comprehends micro-gabbro-types (An60-42), and for simplicity represent the \n\nmassive facies, also including the basalts from the chilled margins and amygdaloidal/occelar \n\nmicro-gabbroic (diabase) rocks. Rocks from each internal zones were classified as follows: (1) \n\nclinopyroxene quartz-monzodiorites (An50-30) with high-silica content from UIZ; (2) \n\nclinopyroxene granodiorite-types (An40-33) from CZ; and (3) clinopyroxene quartz-\n\nmonzodiorite (An45-27) with low-silica content and clinopyroxene quartz-diorite (An48-38), from \n\nLIZ. In general, the recorded modal variations are compatible with evolutionary trends common \n\nto the medium-K calcic-alkaline rocks (Lameyre &amp; Bowden, 1982).  \n\n \nFigure 14: QAP modal diagram for the classification of igneous rocks (Strekeisen, 1976), showing the modal \n\ndiversity within the Limeira Intrusion. Fields: (1): gabbro/diorite, (2) quartz gabbro/diorite, (3) quartz \n\nmonzogabbro/monzodiorite, (4): granodiorite.

Internal stratigraphy \n\n Currently, the best exposures of Limeira intrusion occurs in Cavinatto quarry, where it \n\nexhibits a section of almost 110 meters at its southern portion and 90 meters at the northwest \n\nregion. Its internal stratigraphy is marked by an inwards increase in rock granulation and silica \n\ncontent (principally marked by a granophyric mesostasis increasing), as well as diversification \n\nof textures and structures. The distribution of rock-types within Limeira intrusion occurs almost \n\nas concentric layers, and the variations within this intrusion are summarized in Figure 15. \n\n The Upper Border Zone (UB) comprises micro-gabbroic rocks with a systematic \n\ninwards increase of plagioclase and opaque minerals, and a decrease of clinopyroxene, quartz \n\nand apatite content. The UB margins are made of massive rocks, constituted by aphanitic to \n\nvery fine-grained diabase 1.0-1.5 meters thick, and its chilled margins probably occur along the \n\nentire outline of the intrusion. The uppermost contact of the diabase with the aphanitic rocks, \n\ndown to 5m deep, is characterized by the occurrence of amygdaloidal and ocelli structures, the \n\nlatter made up by rhyolitic/rhyodacitic fine-grained rocks. These gabbroic rocks crop out from \n\n~1.5 to 20-23 meters deep, showing a progressive increase in rock granulation inwards. \n\n The Intermediate Zone (IZ) comprehends medium- to coarse-grained clinopyroxene \n\nquartz-monzodiorite types, as well as medium-grained clinopyroxene quartz-diorite at the lower \n\nportion. Due to the observed stratigraphic distribution, the intermediate zone includes an Upper \n\n \n \n\nQtz-Monzodiorite \n\nSample IC-07b LIM-10 IC-04b IC-01 IC-01b TF-30b TF-23 \n \n\nTF-17 TF-15 LIM-02 \n\nPlagioclase \n44.36 \n\n(2.06) \n\n43.67 \n\n(3,53) \n\n42.33 \n\n(3.21) \n\n45.33 \n\n(3.05) \n\n40.70 \n\n(2.97) \n\n40.60 \n\n(2.77) \n\n41.01 \n\n(2.79) \n\n 40.22 \n\n(2.69) \n\n41.16 \n\n(2.83) \n\n40.95 \n\n(3.11) \n\nClinopyroxene \n17.88 \n\n(2.45) \n\n17.37 \n\n(2.32) \n\n16.07 \n\n(2.47) \n\n17.79 \n\n(1.98) \n\n18.70 \n\n(2.65) \n\n19.30 \n\n(2.73) \n\n16.44 \n\n(1.79) \n\n 15.45 \n\n(2.44) \n\n12.82 \n\n(2.11) \n\n16.45 \n\n(1.89) \n\nOpaques \n10.49 \n\n(2.79) \n\n6.15 \n\n(1.54) \n\n10.40 \n\n(1.62) \n\n6.30 \n\n(1.77) \n\n8.20 \n\n(2.11) \n\n7.70 \n\n(1.83) \n\n5.63 \n\n(1.41) \n\n 7.87 \n\n(1.68) \n\n9.73 \n\n(2.38) \n\n8.10 \n\n(2.18) \n\nGranophyre \n14.99 \n\n(2.05) \n\n16.08 \n\n(2.13) \n\n16.13 \n\n(1.59) \n\n14.59 \n\n(2.95) \n\n13.20 \n\n(1.68) \n\n18.20 \n\n(1.77) \n\n19.18 \n\n(1.44) \n\n 20.66 \n\n(3.11) \n\n21.05 \n\n(2.89) \n\n17.55 \n\n(1.88) \n\nChlorite* \n3.10 \n\n(1.56) \n\n5.86 \n\n(2.34) \n\n5.53 \n\n(1.67) \n\n6.00 \n\n(1.84) \n\n9.40 \n\n(2.75) \n\n6.30 \n\n(1.86) \n\n9.97 \n\n(2.43) \n\n 6.97 \n\n(1.81) \n\n6.64 \n\n(1.74) \n\n6.45 \n\n(1.65) \n\nApatite \n1.40 \n\n(0.79) \n\n1.64 \n\n(0.56) \n\n2.13 \n\n(0.76) \n\n1.35 \n\n(0.49) \n\n1.40 \n\n(0.67) \n\n2.90 \n\n(1.07) \n\n2.14 \n\n(0.81) \n\n 4.06 \n\n(1.77) \n\n2.34 \n\n(0.65) \n\n1.35 \n\n(0.74) \n\nAmpibole \n2.20 \n\n(0.87) \n\n3.67 \n\n(1.12) \n\n3.67 \n\n(1.56) \n\n4.20 \n\n(1.88) \n\n3.80 \n\n(1.54) \n\n1.75 \n\n(0.69) \n\n2.64 \n\n(1.11) \n\n 0.95 \n\n(0.75) \n\n4.58 \n\n(1.79) \n\n5.25 \n\n(2.23) \n\nQuartz \n5.59 \n\n(1.53) \n\n5.56 \n\n(1.24) \n\n3.73 \n\n(1.38) \n\n4.45 \n\n(1.27) \n\n4.60 \n\n(2.08) \n\n3.25 \n\n(1.05) \n\n2.99 \n\n(1.35) \n\n 3.81 \n\n(1.66) \n\n1.68 \n\n(0.77) \n\n3.90 \n\n(2.11) \n\nQAP 64.94 65.31 62.19 64.27 58.50 62,05 63.18 \n \n\n64.69 63.89 62.40 \n\nQ/(QAP) 0.086 0.085 0.054 0.069 0.078 0.052 0.047 \n \n\n0.058 0.026 0.062 \n\nM 31.97 28.83 32.27 29.64 32.10 31.65 26.85 \n \n\n28.43 29.47 31.15 \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n(Upper Intermediate Zone - UIZ) and a Lower layer (Lower Intermediate Zone \u2013 LIZ, including \n\nthe Feeder Zone \u2013 FZ, at the bottom). The contacts of rocks from IZ with surrounding UB and \n\nCZ are usually sharp and marked by the presence of plumose-like plagioclase crystal habits, \n\nthey also present a remarkable increase in granophyre content and granulation, sometimes \n\nassociated with the concentration of felsic or mafic minerals. \n\n The UIZ comprises heterogeneous quartz monzodiorite-types, presenting a \u201cjaguar-\n\nskin\u201d aspect at its uppermost part, due to an irregular distribution of mafic minerals close to the \n\ncontact, and occurring with heterogeneous distributions of felsic- and mafic-pods towards the \n\ncentral region. This zone extends from ca. 20 meters to ca. 60 meters deep and the main \n\ncompositional variations inwards include: (1) the progressive decrease in plagioclase, \n\nclinopyroxene and opaque minerals content and (2) modal increase of granophyre mesostasis. \n\nAt its bottom region, rocks are crosscut by aplitic-like veins with rhyolitic/rhyodacitic \n\ncompositions, frequently in diffuse contacts with host-rocks. Close to its bottom contact, the \n\nfrequency of plumose-like granophyre-type increases. \n\n The Central Zone (CZ) is composed of clinopyroxene granodiorite varieties, in abrupt \n\ncontact with the UIZ rocks. The uppermost region of granodiorite is constituted by very coarse-\n\ngrained rocks, with typical \u201cgrid-like\u201d structures, imprinted by long cm-sized prismatic crystals \n\nof clinopyroxene as well as acicular ilmenite and magnetite. They represent rock types with \n\nrelatively minor amounts of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and apatite contents, and contain K-\n\nfeldspar-quartz granophyre intergrowths reaching up to ~23% in volume in their mesostasis. \n\nRadiating-fringe and cuneiform-types are most frequent granophyre-types in these rocks. Rocks \n\nthat made up the lowermost part of the CZ, and the LIZ uppermost region, are characterized by \n\ntypical \u201clayered-like\u201d and layered structures respectively, in a gradational contact to each other. \n\nVery heterogeneous granodiorites-types compose the CZ lowest layer, presenting horizontal \n\nlenticular-shaped pods with abundant mafic minerals, which results in the \u201clayered-like\u201d \n\nstructure imprinted over the grid-like structure. \n\n The LIZ rocks occur in a gradual contact with granodiorite rocks from CZ, and the main \n\ncompositional variations downwards include: (1) progressive increase in plagioclase, \n\nclinopyroxene, apatite, and opaque minerals content and (2) decrease of granophyre volume. \n\nAt the bottom of LIZ, the transition to the clinopyroxene quartz-diorite that compounds the FZ \n\nis apparently gradational, and both rock-types present the same \u201cjaguar-skin\u201d aspect. At this \n\ntransition zone, the plumose granophyre type increases its frequency. A noticeable textural \n\nvariation can be observed in Figure 15, which is represented by distinct increases in plumose \n\ngranophyre-types on quartz-monzodiorite and quartz-diorite at the bottom of each rock-type \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nlayer. At the Feeder Zone (FZ) of the intrusion, a remarkable magmatic flux structure is oriented \n\nalmost vertically. These rocks-types represents a restricted area in the lowermost part of the \n\noutcrop, in a gradational structural and compositional contact with quartz-monzodiorites. \n\n Important textural features are present at the contact between the main stratigraphic \n\nzones; these are represented by plumose plagioclase crystals habits, plumose- and radial-fringe \n\ngranophyre-types are more frequent, and the presence of a \u201cquenched\u201d mesostasis. Acicular \n\nplagioclase-, clinopyroxene-, and opaque-crystals compose the very fine-grained mesostasis, \n\nwhich includes a probably second generation of fine-grained and well-formed plagioclase \n\ncrystals. These regions are also marked by the presence of elongated clinopyroxene megacrysts \n\nand suggest a drastic change in cooling paths during the final stages of crystallization. Due to \n\nthe hybridization of textures, characterized especially by plagioclase crystals with three \n\ndifferent habits and formed under contrasted cooling-rates, these regions of interaction are \n\nclassified as Hybrid Zones. \n\n The crystallization final stages of the main rock-types also includes the formation of \n\nocelli structures in the uppermost gabbro, as well as millimetric to centimetric-sized rhyolites \n\nand rhyodacites late veins and dikes. These late dikes are present since the LIZ, cutting all rocks \n\non the intrusion until reaching the gabbro-types present at the UB. Apophyllite and interstitial \n\nlow-temperature minerals (i.e. calcite, quartz, titanite, and zeolites) are evidence of a very \n\nimportant hydrothermal process, related to these late liquids and resulting in amygdaloidal \n\nstructures. Post-magmatic substitution reactions are evidenced by chlorite associated with clay \n\nminerals, iron oxides, albite, and quartz, affecting all the primary mineral phases. The frequency \n\nof mineral substitution is greater in the regions of rock contacts, such as seen by the chlorite \n\nmodal abundance in Figure 15. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15: Schematic stratigraphic columns, illustrating the mapped textural, structural, and compositional \n\nvariations within the Limeira Intrusion.

QUANTITATIVE TEXTURAL ANALYSIS  \n\n Before proceeding with the quantitative textural analysis, we carried out statistical tests \n\nfor examining crystal size measured distributions to (1) validate the logarithmic behavior of \n\ncrystal sizes and (2) to detect mixing between contrasted plagioclase populations. Crystal \n\nshapes were determined to characterize their variability within the intrusion and to perform the \n\nneeded stereological corrections. The obtained CSD files are listed in Appendix C. \n\nIV.4.1. Statistical analysis of crystal-size populations \n\n As suggested by our petrographic analysis, the petrographic facies from hybrid zones \n\nmay contain more than one plagioclase crystal-size family. As predicted by the CSD theory, \n\ncrystal sizes must present a lognormal distribution with a high frequency of small units, and if \n\nmixed populations do exist, the same grain-size distribution law should be valid for any \n\npopulation. The separation of different populations may be not a simple task however, and is \n\ndetected only through significant inflections in CSD lines (Higgins, 1996). To test for \n\npopulation mixing hypothesis, statistical analyses were done considering plagioclase crystals \n\nmajor axis in all samples, supported by the expected logarithmic distribution. \n\n Statistical analysis involved the representation of the crystal\u2019s long-axes values in \n\nhistograms, coupled to its cumulative distribution function (CDF). Samples of the hybrid zones \n\npresent small inflections in the probability curves and small discrepancies when compared to a \n\nlognormal model with the same mean and standard deviation. However, the results were not \n\ncapable to distinguish different populations. As a graphical test, the histograms were plotted \n\nwith x-axes on a logarithmic scale, which resulted in \u201cnormal-like\u201d distributions, excepting in \n\nthe hybrid zones (Figure 16). \n\n The logarithmic scale of the x-axis was able to avoid the superposition of the small-\n\nsized crystals in the two families of grains. In addition, it allowed the determination of a \u201csplit-\n\nsize\u201d (grain size, L) between contrasting grain-size families. This step is extremely important \n\nto the calculation of CSD regression lines when different populations are present. \n\nConsequently, the statistical analysis can highlight the presence of different families - on cases \n\nwith almost straight CSD resultant curves -, also revealing more complex cases, such as the TF-\n\n36 sample distribution (Figure 16b). \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 16: Histograms showing the plagioclase long-axis dimensions distributions and the corresponding \n\ncumulative density functions (CDF) for selected samples from the Limeira Intrusion.

Stratigraphic variations of plagioclase crystal-shape and modal abundance  \n\n The determination of crystal shape, in three-dimensional perspective, is very important \n\nfor CSD stereological calculation, since it aims to transform a 2-D raw data into 3-D crystal \n\nsize. Based on non-parametric calculations, Higgins (2000) developed a method to stereological \n\nconversion to transform 2D crystals sections into real 3D distributions. Crystal habit is also \n\nimportant to characterize textural variations, as well as the \u201cClosure Limit\u201d problem intrinsic \n\nto the CSD analysis (see next sections). In this study, plagioclase 3-D shapes were estimated \n\nusing the CSDslice spreadsheet, developed by Morgan &amp; Jerram (2006). In general, a unique \n\ncrystal 3-D habit for samples with different crystal-size families does not affect substantially \n\nthe stereological corrections in our samples. The tests of axes ratio (L/S) of raw data usually \n\nresults in very close values for both size-families, with no significant variability. \n\n Crystal habits are defined in terms of the Aspect Ratio (short: intermediate: long axes \u2013 \n\nS: I: L) and are represented in Figure 17, in diagram I/L versus S/L (Zingg, 1935). Generally, \n\nfrom the border to the central region, crystal shape varies roughly from bladed to tabular \n\nrespectively. As expected, prolate-shaped crystals are typical in the grid-structured \n\ngranodiorites from CZ. Crystal shape variations can be associated with the increase in residence \n\ntime from the intrusion edges to its central region, reflecting the tendency of crystals to become \n\ntabular. On the other hand, on the grid-like rock types, a different tendency can be observed, as \n\nit can be a result of a more complex cooling-path and crystallization history. The great variety \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nof crystal shape and the rough tendency observed within the intrusion is suggestive of different \n\npaths of crystallization, and certainly results of the emplacement process and thermal evolution. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17: Plagioclase crystal morphologies within the Limeira Intrusion, as defined by their intermediate- to \n\nlong-axis and short- to intermediate-axis relative ratios, according to Zingg (1935). See text for discussion. \n\n The resultant aspect ratio, number of crystals, volumetric proportion of plagioclase, as \n\nwell as the considered total area for each sample are present in Table 4. As observed, the \n\nresultant analyzed areas are very contrasting, reflecting the variability of rock-types granulation \n\nwithin Limeira intrusion. We also note that the number of analyzed crystals per volume is less \n\nfrequent on coarse-grained rocks, probably due to an increase in grain-size and most probably \n\nas a consequence of the natural compositional variation. \n\n From the obtained variations of plagioclase crystals habits and modal proportions, is not \n\npossible to observe a straight correlation of these parameters with its stratigraphic position. In \n\na closed system, we should expect progressive and almost continuous changes in plagioclase \n\ncrystal habit, due to a constant evolution of cooling-rates, and a decrease in plagioclase content \n\ndue to the evolution through fractional crystallization. The observed dispersion, especially at \n\nthe critical zones of rock contact, can suggest a more complex magmatic mechanism acting \n\nduring the emplacement and crystallization of Limeira intrusion. In this sense, the resultant \n\ninternal variability can be related with the magmatic differentiation process in association with \n\nperturbations of spatial distribution patterns (SPO), as demonstrated by Higgins (2002). The \n\nnext sections are addressed to quantify the textural variations stratigraphically and to verify the \n\nspatial distribution patterns within this intrusion.  \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nTable 4: Results of the analyzed area, number of crystals, volumetric proportions, and aspect ratio (calculated \n\nusing CSDslice 5). *Volumetric proportion obtained by point counting. \n\nSample Area (mm2) N\u00ba of crystals CSD Vol. (%) Vol. (%)* Aspect ratio \n\nIC-09 (2) 11.54 438 46.980 47.100 1:1.5:3.2 \n\nTF-05 55.78 484 60.095 59.770 1:1.5:3 \n\nIC-08 56.82 339 51.923 51.474 1:2:3 \n\nIC-01 158.42 394 44.219 45.237 1:1.8:2.9 \n\nIC-09 (7) 134.83 367 53.834 53.947 1:1.9:3.6 \n\nIC-07a 308.44 314 57.311 57.771 1:1.5:3.4 \n\nIC-07b 328.21 393 44.086 44.356 1:1.5:2.6 \n\nLIM-10 386.07 238 44.298 43.672 1:1.7:2 \n\nTF-17 615.53 250 40.235 40.221 1:1.6:3.2 \n\nIC-04 346.73 219 38.007 37.026 1:1.4:2.8 \n\nTF-24 503.66 210 40.405 41.006 1:1.9:2.6 \n\nIC-04b 287.60 298 41.589 42.333 1:1.7:2.3 \n\nIC-04c 374.31 341 38.558 38.907 1:1.9:3 \n\nIC-06 366.59 207 40.171 39.980 1:1.1:2.2 \n\nTF-30 773.67 213 36.897 37.500 1:1.3:3 \n\nLIM-02 612.23 370 40.730 40.950 1:1.5:3 \n\nTF-36 644.68 212 39.290 40.101 1:1.6:2.9 \n\nNote: The values of volumetric estimation based on point counting and CSD are very close.

Crystal size distribution \n\n The layout of the different composition and petrographic facies are suggestive of an \n\nintensive fractional crystallization process and/or reinjections of successive magma pulses, \n\nduring the formation of this intrusion. However, it is not simple to split up different magma \n\nbatches using chemical variations or isotopic compositions. In a system under possible \n\nfractional crystallization or replenishment by same-origin melts and possible mixing, the \n\nquantitative textural analysis allows measuring some magmatic effects. According to \n\ncompositional and textural variations, resultant CSD curves for samples of Limeira intrusion \n\nare depicted in Figure 18 and were divided into three main levels: borders, central region, and \n\nhybrid zones. Consequently, it is possible to observe a systematic increase of crystal size \n\ninwards, with specific variations at rock-contact zones. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18: CSDs patterns for the analyzed samples from the main zones of the Limeira Intrusion, grouped \n\naccordantly with similar features and stratigraphic position. Note that the legend for each sample includes the \n\ndistance in meters from the nearest contact. a) Lower (quartz diorites) and Upper (gabbros and microgabbros) \n\nBorder zones showing both grain size and residence time increasing inwards. b) Lower Intermediate, Central and \n\nUpper Intermediate Zones (quartz-monzodiorites and granodiorites) CSD plots. Note grain size increasing \n\ntowards the Central Zone, coupled with a minor residence time increase. c) Hybrid Zone 1, from the upper contact \n\nof the Upper Intermediate Zone, showing inflections in CSD curves for crystal sizes less than 1mm. d) Hybrid zone \n\n2, from the lower contact of the Upper Intermediate Zone, showing minor relatively inflections patterns and \n\naccentuated convex-humps resulting from relatively smaller crystals in sample IC-04. \n\n Notably, from samples distribution, it was possible to quantify the textural variations \n\nwithin Limeira intrusion. Gabbro-types at the UB and quartz-diorite at the BIZ essentially \n\ncompose rocks at the borders of intrusion. In Figure 18a is possible to observe in almost straight \n\nCSD\u2019s lines, an increase in rock-granulation inwards as predicted for steady-state systems. \n\nProbably it results from a simple stage crystallization and increases in residence time inwards. \n\nCSD\u2019s of samples located at the borders exhibits a more expressive convex-upwards hump \n\ninwards, as a result of crystal \u201ccoarsening\u201d, a common feature that is probably associated with \n\nthe decrease in the available melt at late stage crystallization. \n\n Within Limeira intrusion, heterogeneous quartz-monzodiorites and granodiorite rocks \n\nconstitute the intermediate and central region, respectively. The contact between these two \n\nrock-types is often marked by abrupt changes in texture, structure, and composition. However, \n\nthe CSD\u2019s lines are almost coincident in slope and minimum values (Figure 18b). Main \n\ndifferences among these CSD\u2019s reside in its maximum crystal length values, which increases \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\ninto the intrusion\u2019s core. Despite less expressive, the process of \u201ccoarsening\u201d was also observed \n\nin these rocks and associated with a normal plagioclase crystallization process. \n\n The so-called hybrid-zones might represent regions resulted from the extensive filter-\n\npressing process as well as the contact of non-instantaneous magma batches, and comprise two \n\nfamilies of plagioclase grain-size at least. The first hybrid zone defines the contact of uppermost \n\ngabbro from UB with clinopyroxene quartz-monzodiorite from TIZ. In this zone, it is possible \n\nto recognize a huge variation in plagioclase grain-size, and a small inflection in the CSD curves \n\n(Figure 18c). In the Hybrid zone 1 (HZ1), the CSD\u2019s of second crystal population also exhibits \n\na decrease in its slope values inwards, which may be the result of an increase in residence time. \n\n The outcome CSD\u2019s of the second hybrid zone resulted in almost straight lines. \n\nSupported by statistical analysis, it was only possible to distinguish more than one plagioclase \n\npopulation in one sample (Figure 18d). At this region, the samples exhibit a noticeable \n\nhumpback associated with a small proportion of very fine grain-sized crystals. In addition, the \n\n\u2018homogenization\u2019 of crystal families is an important process, due to the increase in residence \n\ntime inwards. Heat accumulation at the centermost region of Limeira intrusion, as well as the \n\npossible time span between magma batches, represent significant processes to grain-size \n\nhomogenization. The Figure 18d depicts the CSD\u2019s of HZ2, where it is possible to observe a \n\nsmall inflection close to 0.9-1.0 millimeter grain-size region that may correspond to the \u201csplit-\n\nsize\u201d in Figure 16.  \n\n The calculation of CSD\u2019s lines was performed through the best-regression aspect ratios \n\nobtained in CSDslice spreadsheet (Morgan &amp; Jerram, 2006), and only crystal-size families with \n\n10 or more crystals were considered to CSD curves. Resultant CSD\u2019s were then approximated \n\nto a regression line, enabling to estimate its final nucleation densities (n0), slope, characteristic \n\nlength (Ci = -1/slope), and linear regressions coefficients (R\n2 \u2013 very close to the maximum \n\nvalue), as summarized in Table 5. The calculation of regression lines was also performed in \n\nsamples with evident two crystal-size families, and based on its respective \u201csplit-size\u201d values. \n\n  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nTable 5: Crystal Size Distribution coefficients obtained on each regression lines.

Internal variability of crystal sizes and CSD closure limit \n\n As predicted by CSD theory, in a steady state open system the slope of straight lines is \n\na direct measure of growth rates and residence time, while the intercept represents its final \n\nnucleation density rates. In this sense, these parameters are able to measure the variability of \n\ncrystal sizes and the final nucleation processes in Limeira intrusion rocks. CSD curves were \n\ncalculated for all samples, and when required to respective second families of crystals, which \n\nresulted in twenty regressions as shown in Figure 19. Their principal characteristic is the \n\nexponential relationship between these parameters, which results in a decrease in the nucleation \n\nprocess coupled with an increase of crystal-sizes and consequently increase in residence time. \n\nBesides that, the variation of crystal-sizes is apparently very dependent on its stratigraphic \n\nposition. \n\n A different path constituted by the second population of crystals present on the hybrid-\n\nzones can be noticed. It results in relatively lesser intercept values than rocks at intrusion \n\nborders, with close values of characteristic length. This feature might be the result of different \n\ncooling-rates and may suggest a very contrasting process of heat loss between rocks from the \n\nedge and inner contacts. The formation of a second family of crystals within an intrusion made \n\nof holocrystalline rocks can result of magma mixing, and/or the increase in the nucleation \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nprocess due to reheating caused by new magma batches, details of this feature are discussed in \n\nthe next sections. \n\n \n\nFigure 19: Plot of plagioclase characteristic length variations as a function of the CSD lines intercept (final \n\nnucleation density, n0) for the results of this study. Calculated closure limit for the average plagioclase aspect \n\nratios (short-: medium-: long-axis = 1:1,6:2.8) considering 100 vol.% crystals (heavy dotted line), 50 vol.% and \n\n150 vol.% (lower and upper light-dotted lines, respectively), following Higgins (2002). Note data distribution \n\nalong the closure limit and their dependence of the intrusion stratigraphy (central vs. borders zones). The hybrid \n\nzones data describe a contrasted path, indicating a relatively lower plagioclase nucleation density. See text for \n\ndiscussion.  \n\n In some cases, the plagioclase crystals can constitute more than 50% of modal \n\nabundance in analyzed samples. Thence, even if it results in straight lines, CSD\u2019s must be \n\nverified if stereological conversions have been correctly effectuated. Conversion of two-\n\ndimensional into three-dimensional data can result in the closure problem, in which individual \n\nphases cannot exceed 100% of rock (Higgins, 2002). As consequence, this system can be \n\nverified by comparing the CSD\u2019s intercept and its resultant characteristic length (Ci = ???), which \n\nis a constant for each CSD line (Ci = -1/slope). Therefore, the closure limit is dependent on the \n\nassumed crystal shapes, and its volumetric proportion. It means that discrepancies in it can be \n\nthe result of CSD calculations, and errors in the determination of crystals shapes and/or \n\nproportions. In our case, the closure limit was calculated for the following aspect ratio: \n\n1:1.6:2.8, which represents the mean 3-D shape for plagioclase crystals in samples. \n\n In Figure 19 is shown the closure limit calculated to crystals with an aspect ratio of 1: \n\n1.6: 2.8, roundness factor equals zero (RF = 0), and three different volumetric proportions, \n\n100% +50% in accordance to Higgins (2002). The outcome validates the resultant CSD lines, \n\nplagioclase volumetric proportion, and shape. Variation of characteristic length and CSD \n\nintercept are directly related to sample stratigraphic position, which occurs parallel to the \n\nClosure Limit and close to the 50% line. An important effect observed in this model is the \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\ninwards decrease of plagioclase modal abundance, compatible with real compositional \n\nvariations. \n\nIV.4.5. Spatial distribution patterns of crystals  \n\n Generally, the emplacement of igneous bodies compounds of a great diversity of \n\nphysical mechanisms, which is also responsible to modify the spatial distribution of crystals \n\n(Mock et al., 2003; Jerram et al., 2003). The application of modal-proportion versus \n\ncharacteristic length diagram can provide important information about magmatic processes, as \n\nsuggested by Higgins (2002). In this diagram, almost a systematic variation in modal abundance \n\nof plagioclase versus CSD\u2019s can be observed, principally in the textural coarsening to the \n\ncentermost region of the intrusion, which is also coupled with the decrease in modal abundance \n\n(Figure 20). Variations in modal abundance of plagioclase are directly related to chemical \n\nvariations of rock composition, and in a closed system, a strong correlation with crystal sizes \n\nmay be expected. However, as shown by the shades in Figure 20 samples from the hybrid zones \n\nexhibits greater values of modal abundance than \u2018expected\u2019, based on our model, for the same \n\ncrystal size, in this intrusion. \n\n \n\nFigure 20: Plagioclase characteristic length variation as a function of modal abundance, parameters take as \n\nrepresentative of growth-rate and growth-time, respectively (Higgins, 2002). The arrow indicates the approximated \n\ntrend of textural coarsening within Limeira intrusion; shaded areas depict the dispersion of the Hybrid Zones in \n\nrelation to the main expected trend. See text for discussion.  \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n As well as in CSD\u2019s versus modal abundance diagram, the SDP analysis also shows a \n\nroughly systematic variation. In the diagram, R-value versus Matrix Volume (Figure 21) it is \n\npossible to note that our samples exhibit a touching framework in a clustered distribution, with \n\nan almost progressive inwards decrease in R-values. A practically direct variation can also be \n\nobserved, in which the increase in R-values is coupled to the decrease in matrix volume, starting \n\nfrom the borders to the centermost region of the intrusion. \n\n \nFigure 21: R-values versus the matrix abundance (= 100% - plagioclase% vol.) for the CSD results obtained in \n\nthis study. The Random Sphere Distribution Line (RSDL), as calculated by Jerram et al. (1996), limits clustered \n\nfrom ordered crystal arrangements. Note an almost progressive increase in R-value, coupled to decrease in matrix \n\nproportion, from the center to border regions within Limeira intrusion. The shade highlights an observed \n\ndispersion, caused by rocks present on Hybrid Zones. See text for discussion.  \n\n This relationship is compatible with the compaction/overgrowth trends and presents a \n\ngreat dispersion on its intermediate zones. The dispersion on the evolutionary tendency is more \n\nevident in rocks from hybrid zones. As shown by the shade in Figure 21, this is the result of an \n\nincreasingly poor sorting trend, where samples of uppermost hybrid zones presenting non-\n\ntouching and even ordered frameworks. For tabular intrusions, the R-value method predicts an \n\nincrease in crystal clustering (decrease in R-value) in regions close to its walls, or even between \n\nsuccessive magma batches. In this way, the observed dispersion may be the result of a more \n\ncomplex emplacement process. \n\n The variations of SPD parameters observed in this intrusion are not compatible with a \n\nsimple stage emplacement, in which the most important dispersions are related to hybrid zones. \n\nIn this sense, the representation of the R-value, as a function of the depth of the samples, can \n\npossibly provide more information about magmatic mechanisms. The results of SDP within \n\nLimeira intrusion as a function of each sample\u2019s depth are synthesized in Table 6. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nTable 6: Spatial Distribution Patterns values for each analyzed sample and its stratigraphic position. \n\nSample Depth* R-value Vector length AF ???

Emplacement mechanisms and influence of magma flow to rock fabric \n\n During the emplacement of igneous bodies, the magmatic flow and shear are capable to \n\nmodify the SDP and orientation of crystals, in the chamber. Analogously to a laminar flow in a \n\npipe, the magma flowing within tabular structures (i.e. dikes and sills) can transport large \n\ncrystals towards its interior (Mock et al., 2003). The effect of sheet-like intrusions emplacement \n\ncan result in characteristics R-values profiles, and consequently clustering increase to its \n\nborders (Jerram et al., 1996), as well as close to contacts between consecutive magma batches \n\n(Mock et al., 2003). \n\n A profile of SDP parameters (R-value and Alignment Factor versus depth) is presented \n\nin Figure 22a. The stratigraphic variation of the clustering coincides the lowest R-values (i.e. \n\nincrease in clustering) with the zones of contact between different rocks, and consequently, it \n\nis remarkably coincident with hybrid zones. On the other hand, the highest values of clustering \n\nroughly represent the transitional region between different lower-R zones. As seen in Figure \n\n22a, the hybrid zones are highlighted by rectangular shades and coinciding with low R-values \n\nin three main zones, each one separated by the highest R-values. \n\n Depending on the magma volume and replenishment rate, in a confined environment, \n\nthe magma flow might align the minerals in the crystallization process. Consequently, the \n\norientation of crystal long-axes in profiles may highlight distinct regions, where the layer \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nboundaries can be defined by the increase of crystals alignment. Considering this, we \n\nconstructed a mean crystal orientation profile, which is based on sample stratigraphic position \n\nand the plagioclase Alignment Factors (AF) (Figure 22b). \n\n Accordingly, the obtained results of AF from most of the tested samples are relatively \n\nlow when compared to rocks with visible preferential crystal shape orientation. On a scale of 0 \n\nto 1, the general values of alignment vary from 0.03 to 0.26, reaching 0.59 in only one sample, \n\nrepresentative of the feeder zone and not represented in this profile. Even resulting in small \n\nvalues, the variability of crystal alignment is apparently dependent on its stratigraphic position \n\nand related to the hybrid zones. As shown in Figure 22b, the highest values of crystal alignment \n\ncorrespond to the hybrid zones, while the lowest values coincide with regions farthest from \n\nthose areas. Mean crystal long-axis orientation usually results in almost horizontal values at the \n\nhybrid zones and can be more dispersed at other positions, as evidenced in Figure 22b. The \n\nrose diagrams in Figure 22c exhibits the dispersion of crystal orientation, revealing the \n\npreferential crystal orientation horizontally displayed, roughly parallel to N-S general direction. \n\n \nFigure 22: Plagioclase crystal clustering (R-Value, a) and alignment factor (AF, b) parameters variations as a \n\nfunction of depth within the Limeira Intrusion.

Note the correspondence with low R-values and high Alignment Factor \n\nvalues with the critical zones. c) The corresponding rose diagram to each sample, almost N-S oriented generally. \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nIV.4.7. Sr isotope constraints and ICSD plots \n\n The initial 87Sr/86Sr values as well as the analytical spots distances from plagioclase \n\ncrystal cores - obtained for selected samples from the Hybrid zone 1 (HZ1), Central zone (CZ), \n\nand Feed zone (FZ) - are listed in Table 7, and represented in ICSD-type plots in Figure 23. \n\nAs seen, sample IC-07a from HZ1 present a marked isotope ratio increase from plagioclase \n\ncore to rims (Figure 23a), a pattern also observed for sample TF-36, from CZ (Figure 23b). \n\nContrastingly, the opposite behavior can be observed at the FZ, where the Sr-isotopic and \n\ncrystal-sizes exhibits a negative correlation, and the isotopic signature of the FZ-plagioclase \n\nrims are close to those observed in HZ1 and CZ plagioclase cores. \n\n \nFigure 23: ICSD-type diagrams correlating plagioclase crystal size with (87Sr/86Sr)i isotopic initial ratios. a) \n\nSample IC-07a, from the Hybrid-zone 1. Note the kink in the CSD curve coinciding with an abrupt change in \n\nisotopic ratios highlighted by the dotted line. b) ICSD plot for TF-36 sample, present in the central region of \n\nLimeira intrusion, and c) LIM-02 sample, present at the intrusion\u2019s feeder zone. Boxes were drawn with \u00b12? of \n\nuncertainty on isotopic ratios. Initial ratios calculated for a 132 Ma age. The Upper horizontal gray bar represents \n\na whole-rock isotopic initial ratio, from Oliveira &amp; Dantas (2008), and the lower horizontal light-red bar represents \n\nthe average baseline common for all samples.  \n\n  Despite being preceded by an apparently gradual variation, the noticeable increase in \n\nthe isotopic ratio of the sample present at HZ1 (Figure 23a) coincides with a significant slope \n\nincrement in CSD curve. This relationship may be attributed to mixing between filtered-residual \n\nmelt present in the first magma batch and the second magma injection during the crystallization \n\nprocess, which generate the fine-grained plagioclase family by changing the nucleation- and \n\ncooling rates. Variation in isotopic ratios for plagioclase crystals from HZ1 and CZ samples \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nexhibits similar trends, reaching similar isotopic ratios. Even not exhibiting a kink in CSD \n\ncurve, histograms for centermost granodiorites frequently presented complex long-axis \n\ndistributions (Figure 16b). Coupled with isotopic analysis, the results indicate a probable \n\nmagma mixing, which results in plagioclase populations that may have crystallized at the same \n\nconditions, marked by the linear CSD results. \n\n In general, isotope ratios vary from a minimum of ~0.7054 to maximum values up to \n\n~0.7057. From 87Sr/86Sr variation ranges, it is possible to recognize an expressive average \n\nisotope ratio (~0.705467 \u00b1 25) as a baseline, represented as the horizontal light red bar in Figure \n\n23, present principally in CZ and FZ samples. A more detailed analysis in ICSD plots can reveal \n\nthe ubiquitous presence of inherited crystal-cores, occurring as antecrysts and representing the \n\nlargest plagioclase crystals. As observed, inherited cores from HZ1 exhibits the same isotopic \n\nratio than most of CZ plagioclase crystals. On the other hand, the isotopic ratio from CZ \n\nplagioclase inherited cores can reach values of ~0.7053, and crystals between ~6 to 2 mm of \n\nsize represent a plateau of isotopic ratios, probably sharing the same evolutionary history of \n\nantecrysts present in the sample HZ1, and crystal rims in FZ sample. \n\nTable 7: Isotopic 87Sr/86Sri ratio, uncertainty, and core distance for plagioclase crystals. \n\nSample 87Sr/86Sr Rb/Sr 87Sr/86Sri \nUncertainty \n\n(2s) \nDistance  \n\nLong axis \n\n(mm)  \n\nIC-07 a        \n\nPlag. 1 0.7054653 0.0019 0.7054551 0.0000390 0.00 Core 3.62 \n\nPlag. 1 0.7056025 0.0020 0.7055911 0.0000467 0.85 Rim - \n\nPlag. 2 0.7055505 0.0038 0.7055300 0.0000423 0.00 Core 2.33 \n\nPlag. 2 0.7057231 0.0013 0.7057158 0.0000543 0.92 Rim - \n\nPlag. 3 0.7055346 0.0016 0.7055258 0.0000410 0.00 Core 2.80 \n\nPlag. 3 0.7055659 0.0018 0.7055564 0.0000564 0.65 Rim - \n\nPlag. 4 0.7055680 0.0017 0.7055589 0.0000595 0.00 Core 1.84 \n\nPlag. 5 0.7055208 0.0015 0.7055124 0.0000545 0.00 Core 3.16 \n\nPlag. 6 0.7055851 0.0016 0.7055762 0.0000483 0.00 Core 1.78 \n\nPlag. 6 0.7055984 0.0018 0.7055887 0.0000472 0.55 Rim - \n\n        \n\nTF-36        \n\nPlag. 1 0.7055912 0.0019 0.7055808 0.0000487 0.00 Core 0.96 \n\nPlag. 2 0.7054689 0.0019 0.7054588 0.0000280 0.00 Core 5.49 \n\nPlag. 2 0.7056221 0.0047 0.7055967 0.0000439 0.89 Rim - \n\nPlag. 3 0.7055868 0.0017 0.7055775 0.0000503 0.00 Core 6.04 \n\nPlag. 3 0.7053137 0.0021 0.7053022 0.0000302 0.74 Rim - \n\nPlag. 4 0.7054986 0.0023 0.7054861 0.0000303 0.00 Core 3.11 \n\nPlag. 5 0.7054900 0.0021 0.7054784 0.0000285 0.00 Core 3.87 \n\nPlag. 5 0.7055742 0.0022 0.7055622 0.0000458 0.55 Rim - \n\nPlag. 6 0.7054696 0.0020 0.7054589 0.0000381 0.00 Core 4.96 \n\nPlag. 6 0.7056912 0.0015 0.7056830 0.0000580 0.97 Rim - \n\nPlag. 7 0.7054773 0.0061 0.7054440 0.0000403 0.00 Core 4.57 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nTable 7 - Continuation: Isotopic 87Sr/86Sri ratio, uncertainty, and core distance for plagioclase crystals. \n\nSample 87Sr/86Sr Rb/Sr 87Sr/86Sri \nUncertainty \n\n(2s) \nDistance  \n\nLong axis \n\n(mm)  \n\nLIM-02        \n\nPlag. 1 0.7056280 0.0017 0.7056188 0.0000692 0.00 Core 5.11 \n\nPlag. 1 0.7055317 0.0080 0.7054884 0.0000396 0.55 Rim - \n\nPlag. 2 0.7054406 0.0017 0.7054312 0.0000399 0.00 Core 0.71 \n\nPlag. 3 0.7055068 0.0016 0.7054979 0.0000787 0.00 Core 2.22 \n\nPlag. 3 0.7054947 0.0020 0.7054752 0.0000660 0.65 Rim - \n\nPlag. 3 0.7054863 0.0046 0.7054699 0.0000408 0.52 Rim - \n\nPlag. 4 0.7055543 0.0027 0.7055396 0.0000340 0.00 Core 4.83 \n\nPlag. 4 0.7055338 0.0012 0.7055273 0.0000671 0.73 Rim - \n\nPlag. 4 0.7054964 0.0016 0.7054880 0.0000620 0.34 Rim - \n\nPlag. 5 0.7056447 0.0015 0.7056364 0.0000696 0.00 Core 5.88 \n\nPlag. 5 0.7054380 0.0018 0.7054281 0.0000331 0.93 Rim - \n\n        \n\nWhole-\n\nrock \n\n \n 0.7057717 \n\n0.0000200 \nOliveira &amp; Dantas (2008) \n\nSiltite   0.7275888 0.0000200 Oliveira &amp; Dantas (2008) \n\n \n\nIV.4.8. Residence time and thermal evolution  \n\n CSD measurements and sample stratigraphic positioning allow to estimate the residence \n\ntime for plagioclase and to suggest a thermal evolutionary model for the intrusion. If the \n\nplagioclase growth rate (G) is constant, it can be calculated from the CSD\u2019s lines slopes when \n\nthe residence time (?t) is known (Eq. 1); from growth rates and the CDS line intercepts, we can \n\nestimate the nucleation rate (J). Taking the shape of the Limeira Intrusion as tabular in a first \n\napproximation, residence time may be obtained according to Zieg &amp; Marsh (2002) formulation, \n\ngiven by: \n\n? = ?? = ?\n2\n\n??2\n?                                                                (7) \n\nwhere z, measured in centimeters, is the distance from borders to the central region of the \n\nintrusion, k is the constant of thermal diffusivity (k = 10-2cm2s-1), and b is the isotherm constant \n\n(b = 0.475) (Zieg &amp; Marsh, 2002).  \n\n The distances between samples and the intrusion top were measured directly, while the \n\ndistances from the intrusion bottom and samples downwards the central region were estimated \n\nfrom available magnetometric modeling (Lino et al., 2018). The obtained values for the ?, G, J, \n\nand cooling rates are summarized in Table 8. The cooling rates were computed considering \n\nliquidus and solidus temperatures about 1250\u00baC and 850\u00baC, respectively, as estimated with \n\nRhyolite-MELTS (Gualda &amp; Ghiorso, 2014), compatible volatile contents and crystallization \n\nclose to the QFM (quartz-fayalite-magnetite) buffer.  Residence time values vary from ca. 231 \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nto 108.367 days from the intrusion upper border to its central region, which results in \n\ncontrasting cooling rates ranging from 1.733\u00baC/day to 0.004\u00baC/day, respectively. \n\nTable 8: Values of residence time, cooling rate, and the distances from Limeira intrusion\u2019s borders. \n\nSample Z* (cm) R.

A similar situation is observed in the Limeira \n\npatterns, and to check the hypothesis of steady-state crystallization the correlation between CSD \n\nintercept [ln(n0)] and slope (S) values must satisfy the equation: \n\nln(?0) = 4 ln(?) ? ln(?)                                                       (8) \n\nwhere C is the dimensionless constant. Results are depicted in Figure 24a and demonstrate that \n\nthe Limeira Intrusion does not conform such a single model. Our patterns define two contrasted \n\ncorrelate sets with contrasted cooling paths, one including samples collected in the upper half \n\nof the intrusion and the other grouping samples from the lower half as well as the fine-grained \n\nplagioclase populations from the hybrid zones. This indicates different cooling rates, which \n\nmay be caused by the emplacement of new magma batches at the intrusion\u2019s lower half. \n\n The crystal size variations within tabular-like intrusions are directly resultant of the \n\ncrystallization paths and helps to understand their thermal evolution. Zieg &amp; Marsh (2002) add \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\na time constant ??  to the crystallization time ? to account for intrusion thickness, as the \n\nparameter ?? in Eq. 1 is related to the mean crystal sizes, to obtain: \n\n??? = ?(? + ?? )                                                                  (9) \n\nwhere ??  is larger in the case of higher contact temperatures and intrusion thickness, as the \n\ncooling at intrusion\u2019s contacts demands more time to begin. In Figure 24b we plot sample \n\ndepth (Z), the distance from tothe p and bottom intrusion edges, vs. the mean grain-size (???) of \n\nthe main plagioclase crystal populations to compare our data with those predicted by the steady-\n\nstate model. In this diagram, we plot simulations for ? and ? values representative that best fits \n\nwith the centermost and upper border samples, where the models must include growth ratios \n\nranging from the maximum and minimum estimated values, 3.0 x 10-9 mm.s-1 to 1.20 x 10-10 \n\nmm.s-1, respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 24: Diagrams illustrating the main variation patterns of plagioclase CSD parameters and depth within the \n\nLimeira Intrusion. The two model curves in each plot show the expected behavior in steady-state crystallizing \n\nsystems. a) Intercept vs. slope plot: relatively homogeneous samples from several stratigraphic positions within \n\nthe intrusion are represented in blue; samples from the hybrid zones and from the lowermost intrusion level in \n\nblack. b) Depth (*distance from the nearest contact) vs. crystal mean length plot. Both diagrams indicate significant \n\ndepartures from single models based on a steady-state magmatic evolution. Constant C=2.  \n\n As seen, the first model describe with a good fit the observed crystal-size variation of \n\nthe central and bottom regions, while the second model accounts the grain-size coarsening from \n\nthe uppermost region. On the other hand, the intermediate intrusion zone does not conform to \n\nany single model, which may instead point to a thermal re-equilibration between the adjacent \n\nupper and centermost zones that evolve along two different cooling paths with distinct heat \n\ntransfer rates.  \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n Considering that the observed crystal-size variation results from multiple injections of \n\nmagma replenish the magma chamber, the time-span between consecutive pulses is an \n\nimportant issue. From the CSD data alone, it is not possible to constrain the time interval among \n\nthem. Nevertheless, some information may be extracted from the analysis of the residence time \n\nof the second plagioclase crystals generation, which might represent the crystallization final \n\nstages, and compared to each other. In our case, we assumed an increase in the nucleation-rate \n\nthat resulted in the second generation of crystals. In this sense, the residence time was estimated \n\nusing samples present at the borders that exhibit similar CSD slopes, based on their nucleation-\n\nrate as a reference (i.e. TF-05 and IC-08, J = 7.82 and 98.68 x 10-7). Moreover, the results of \n\nresidence time, cooling-rate, reference nucleation-rates, and volumetric proportion of the \n\nsecond plagioclase families are presented in Table 9. \n\nTable 9: Residence time and plagioclase volumetric proportion from hybrid zones. \n\nSample Slope G\u00ba(mm s-1) J\u00ba*1 (n\u00ba/mm-3 s) ?

Values \n\ncorrespond to a percentage of the total; *3: Time ratio, between residence time of principal and second plagioclase \n\nfamily; *4: Second plagioclase family. \n\n \n\n As noticed, the residence time for plagioclase crystals at the HZ1 (IC-07a) is less than \n\na fifth of crystallization time for crystals at the HZ2 (IC-04c), and hence, suggests a more rapid \n\ncooling due to the thermal gradient. In addition, the residence time increases inwards (IC-07b), \n\nwith increasing distance from rock contact. At the hybrid-zones, the volumetric proportion of \n\nfine-grained plagioclase is apparently constant, ranging from ~10% to 11.5%, despite the \n\ndrastically inwards decrease. The volumetric variation can suggest a distancing from the zone \n\nof interaction between consecutive magma batches and is not observed in HZ2 due to the large \n\ntime of crystallization taken, as well as the possible thermal re-equilibration \n\nIV.5. DISCUSSION \n\n The following sections are addressed to explain and purpose some mechanisms of \n\nemplacement that acted during Limeira intrusion formation. To accomplish it, we considered \n\nbased several features, such as the magma physical properties, isotopic evidence of magmatic \n\ninteraction, and the effects of time-span between consecutive magmas pulses. We also \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\ndiscussed the bases of recent models of tabular intrusions formation, and the geological and \n\ngeometric models for this intrusive occurrence (i.e. Lino et al., 2018). \n\nIV.5.1. Structural and compositional aspects \n\n The layout of structures and contact between Limeira intrusion and host-rocks are \n\ncompatible with some predicted mechanisms of intrusion formation. The sedimentary \n\ndiscontinuity is an important feature, responsible for the creation of an environment with \n\nconsiderable rheological contrast, which accommodates the first magma batch. The host rocks \n\ndo not present a great rheological contrast, and the formation of a dike protrusion is compatible \n\nwith the laboratory models of Kavanagh et al. (2017) (dike-sill hybrid geometry). The increase \n\nin local stress probably results in the horizontal magmatic spreading, responsible for initiate the \n\nemplacement of the intrusion. \n\n In Figure 25a this process is synthesized based on our data, where the sedimentary \n\ncontact is responsible for a lithological discontinuity and rheological contrast that acted as a \n\ntrap. The lack of faults in the sandstone suggests that the first magma pulse might have increased \n\nthe rheological contrast within the sedimentary rock discontinuity, and the evolutionary process \n\nof emplacement occurred by mid-accretion of new magma batches (Figure25b, c). \n\n \n\nFigure 25: Charts illustrating the proposed emplacement model for the Limeira Intrusion. a) First magma pulse \n\nemplacement through the feeder dike along a sub-vertical discontinuity. Continuous flow and intrusion along the \n\nsiltstone-sandstone horizontal contact actionng as a \u201cless-stress\u201d structural plane, which results in faulting and \n\nupward moving of the sandstone layers over the flow. b) The first magma pulse increases the local rheological \n\ncontrast, providing the emplacement of subsequent magma batches within the first intrusion, at the region with \n\nmore ductile behavior. c) The installation of the latter magma pulse, resulting of mid-accretion and final estimated \n\ngeometry of Limeira intrusion, results of the same acting emplacement mechanism. d) Expected CSD patterns \n\nwithin the constitute intrusion and hybrid zones, velocity profiles, deduced from R-value distributions, and simple \n\nshear components at the contacts between magmatic pulses.  \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n Even comprising stratigraphic compositional variations that include some abrupt \n\ncontacts between different rocks-types, the layout is still compatible with a \u2018closed-system\u2019 \n\nunder fractional crystallization. The main compositional changes are associated with structural \n\nand textural variations, principally next to the contacts, where facies are distributed as \n\nconcentric layers. In general, it is possible to distinguish three main layers with the same \n\nstructural aspects in this intrusion. The first layer is comprised by gabbro-types; quartz-\n\nmonzodiorite types with high silica content and the quartz-diorite types, due to the similar \n\nstructural \u201cjaguar-skin\u201d aspect compose the second layer and finally; and the third layer is \n\ncomposed by granodiorite and quartz-monzodiorite types with low silica content, defining the \n\nlayered series. \n\n All these three layers are limited by textural variations associated with structural and \n\ncompositional changes. In the second and third layers, rocks with similar structures and textures \n\ncompose each one. In addition, it is possible to observe in both layers some common features, \n\nas the presence of silica-rich rocks in the uppermost region, and silica-poor rocks at the bottom. \n\nThese compositional characteristics certainly result in almost independent evolutionary \n\nhistories to each layer, as the response of fractional crystallization and/or other magmatic \n\nprocesses as crystal settling or immiscibility process due to the presence of layered rocks, for \n\nexample. \n\nIV.5.2. The influence of magma emplacement dynamics on CSD and SDP \n\n The resultant CSD and SDP of plagioclase crystals are clearly stratigraphically \n\ndependents. Through CSD analysis, it was possible to recognize a systematic inwards increase \n\nof grain size, as well as to describe at least two zones of rock contact with more than one crystal-\n\nsize family. Furthermore, the analysis of the crystals long-axis orientation revealed a strong \n\ncorrelation between the SPO and SDP parameters at the Hybrid Zones. From these results, and \n\ncoupled with structural, geological, and available geophysical data, it was possible to conceive \n\nthe evolutionary process of emplacement for the Limeira intrusion (Figure 25). \n\n As expected during the emplacement of tabular intrusions, the velocity profiles of \n\nmagma increase from its edges to the center, while the orientation of crystals increases at the \n\nboundaries. From SDP (R-values) and orientation tests, it is possible to distinguish at least three \n\ndifferent zones within Limeira intrusion, which each one is limited by relatively great variations \n\nof these parameters (Figure 25d). Orientation tests resulted in a relatively low-values of \n\nAlignment Factors, probably due to the plastic behavior of the \u201cconduct-walls\u201d during magma \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nemplacement. However, the stratigraphic distribution of crystal orientation values and the mean \n\norientation angle are still compatible with a multiple stage emplacement. \n\nIV.5.3. ICSD analysis and evolution of crystal populations \n\n The Sr-isotopic analysis of available whole-rock data revealed an inwards decrease in \n\nradiogenic strontium ratio in the Limeira intrusion, which ranges varied from 0.707250 at the \n\nchilled margins to 0.7057717 at the \u201ccentral gabbro\", and reaching up to 0.7059697 in the \n\nrhyolite veins (Oliveira &amp; Dantas, 2008). Coupled with the obtained in situ microanalyses of \n\nplagioclase crystals, these variations are compatible with the purposed mechanical model of \n\nemplacement. The 87Sr/86Sri ratio decreases progressively inwards, and as evidenced by sample \n\nLIM-02 from the Feeder Zone, it also indicates a decreasing trend in the assimilation of host-\n\nrocks by fresh magma pulses. Consequently, it is compatible with a model with added \n\nprogressive replenishment, in which successive magma pulses through the same conduit does \n\nnot make contact with the host-rocks. \n\n Close to Hybrid Zones, crystals rims exhibit more radiogenic Sr-ratios than in the cores, \n\nrevealing that secondary plagioclase family could be the result of \u201cmagma mixing\u201d associated \n\nwith filtered residual melts migration. This process may be responsible for the crystallization \n\nduring the reheating, and observed humpbacks in UB CSD\u2019s might result from the extraction \n\nof residual liquids. The isotopic results, associated with textural and compositional features, \n\ncorroborates with the mechanism of filter pressing, which may be caused by hyperbolic shear \n\nflow during the emplacement of fresh magma pulses. Analysis In situ also reveals an important \n\ncontribution of antecrysts in rocks with medium- to coarse-grain sized, a product of the putative \n\nmixing between the two latest intrusions. Although indicating a more complex history, \n\nplagioclase crystals present at the central region of Limeira intrusion were submitted to a simple \n\nstage crystallization history, and their presence probably increases the estimated residence time \n\ndue to its common large sizes. \n\nIV.5.4. Effects of time-span between magmatic pulses and thermal evolution \n\n The thermal evolution of any intrusion is the direct result of its volume, heat \n\naccumulation, and heat transfer. In this sense, the volume of successive magma batches and the \n\ntime span between magmatic pulses exercises a fundamental role in cooling-rate in addition to \n\nthe textural evolution. In the case of the Limeira intrusion, it is possible to recognize a \n\nsystematic variation on its textures, principally those on the clinopyroxene and plagioclase \n\nshape, and granophyre-types, which are not compatible with the available thermal models. In a \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nsteady state system, formed by one or a few magma pulses in a constant accretion-rate, the same \n\ntextural variation is virtually not possible. \n\n Considering the thermal models and the metamorphic process of host-rocks, our results \n\nenable us to suggest that a small but first pulse initiated the intrusion process, where it acted as \n\na thermal insulation. Furthermore, at least three magma pulses formed the intrusion. Evidence \n\nof these three different cooling-paths events is based on the variation of mean grain-size, as \n\nseen in Figure 24b, and the inflection zones that connect the two different models of mean-\n\nlength variation corresponds to rocks of HZ 1 e HZ 2.  \n\n A detailed structural and micro-textural analysis, coupled with isotopic microanalysis \n\nand stratigraphic distributions, allowed us to identify regions of magma interaction within the \n\nLimeira intrusion. The preservation of these structures and textures are the result of the time-\n\nspan between consecutive magma batches. The time-span may seem long enough to cause a \n\ngreat difference in cooling-paths, and if magma composition of successive pulses is considered \n\nthe same, then the great thermal gradient between these magma batches is a direct result of \n\ndifferences in crystallinity. Finally, based on the marked presence of two-plagioclase grain-size \n\nfamilies, as well as the difference of residence time, we suggest that the time-span between the \n\nfirst and second pulses was greater than the interval between the second and third. \n\n  \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nIV.6. CONCLUSION \n\n The integration of host-rock structural aspects, the compositional features of rock-types, \n\ntextural distribution, quantitative textural analysis and in situ isotopic ratios of Sr in plagioclase \n\ncrystals, allowed us to interpret and quantify the emplacement process and the thermal evolution \n\nof Limeira intrusion. Consequently, our results strongly support a multiple-stage igneous \n\nevolution, caused by non-instantaneous successive emplacement of different magma pulses \n\nduring the assembly of this intrusion. The apparent alignment (SPO) and clustering (SPD) of \n\ncrystals corroborate with the amalgamation process of successive sill-like magma batches, on \n\nthe formation and growth of this intrusion. Moreover, the isotopic data suggested small amounts \n\nof country rocks assimilation and an important contribution of the filter-pressing mechanism \n\nduring its emplacement and evolution, and probably contributing to the increase in silica content \n\nand great diversity of rock-types. \n\n Internal compositional and structural heterogeneities of Limeira intrusion has long been \n\nrelated solely to the process of fractional crystallization in a closed-system, associated with \n\nfilter pressing. However, the CSD\u2019s strongly suggest crystals had grown under the influence of \n\nchanges in the cooling path. In addition, the inwards variation of grain-size also supports the \n\nthree thermal-independent reinjections model, which resulted in a great internal accumulation \n\nof heat. Major cooling between batches provided an important rheological response, being \n\ncapable to act as a trap for consecutive pulses. It was responsible for the generation of a rigid \n\nsurface in a confined environment, where crystals have aligned and clustered. Additionally, the \n\ncomplex thermal evolution of Limeira intrusion might be a great influence for its structural, \n\ntextural, and compositional heterogeneities, as well as its magmatic evolutionary process. \n\n Even comprising layered rocks, crystal alignment is not compatible with the mechanism \n\nof crystal settling or flux-segregation, as observed in many analogous occurrences. Therefore, \n\nthese results might open avenues for characterization and quantification of specific magmatic \n\nprocesses, which acted during the formation of Limeira intrusion. As a result, this study \n\nprovides significant data, which can be tested and, perhaps, extrapolated to other layered \n\nintrusions, especially those related to heat maintenance and other specific magmatic \n\nmechanisms.  \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nV.1. SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS \n\n The integration of ground and aerial magnetic data, geological information and \n\nmagnetic susceptibility measurements in rocks allowed set out an improved interpretation of \n\nthe lateral distribution and the 2D geometry of the Limeira Intrusion. Additionally, host-rock \n\nstructural aspects, the compositional features of rock-types, textural distribution, quantitative \n\ntextural analysis and in situ Sr-isotopic ratios in plagioclase crystals, allowed interpret and \n\nquantify the emplacement process and its thermal evolution, respectively. The main conclusions \n\nof this dissertation may be highlighted as follows: \n\n(1) The Limeira intrusion has an elliptical-like shape from its top-view, occupying a top \n\narea of about 2.5 to 3.0 km2 and its thickest zone corresponds to the Cavinatto quarry \n\nnorth portion; \n\n(2) The modeled two-dimensional magnetometric profiles support a lopolithic-like \n\nintrusion geometry, as previously suggested from geologic and petrologic evidence \n\n(e.g., Lino, 2015); \n\n(3) The analysis of the two-dimensional profiles allows inferring that the intrusion \n\nevolved trough progressively emplacement of fresh magmatic pulses in the central \n\nzone of the magmatic chamber, causing its growth by mechanisms of inner-accretion \n\n(e.g., Menand, 2011); \n\n(4)  The northern region coincides with the thicker zone of the intrusion, and supports \n\nthe hypothesis that this may be the feeder area of the intrusion; \n\n(5) Compositional and textural data strongly supports a multiple-stage igneous \n\nevolution, caused by non-instantaneous successive emplacement of different magma \n\npulses during the assembly of this intrusion, coherent with the results based on the \n\nobtained geophysical model; \n\n(6) The apparent alignment (SPO) and clustering (SPD) of plagioclase crystals \n\ncorroborates with an amalgamation process made up by successive sheet-like \n\nmagma batches; \n\n(7)  The available and obtained Sr-isotopic results, coupled with textural analysis, are \n\nsuggestive of small amounts of country rocks assimilation, especially from the rock-\n\ntypes present at Limeira intrusion borders, and evidenced by inherited-anticrystal \n\ncores (with high 87Sr/86Sr ratios) in the feeder zone; \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n(8) Additionally, an important contribution of the filter-pressing mechanism, during its \n\nemplacement and evolution, is evidenced by the high 87Sr/86Sr ratios obtained in the \n\nplagioclase crystal rims and/or smallest crystals, formed during magmatic mixing at \n\nHybrid Zones. Probably the filter-pressing has contributed to the increase in silica \n\ncontent inwards and the great diversity of rock-types; \n\n(9) The assembly process can be attributed to the amalgamation of at least three magma \n\npulses, each one emplaced within the precursor. It results in a stepped-wise cooling \n\nprocess, in which each magmatic layer evolves separately and heat accumulation \n\nmay be responsible for the extremely coarsening of the inner rock-types; \n\n(10) Finally, the results open new avenues for detailed thermal studies, based on the \n\ntotal size of the intrusion and the estimative of each magma pulse volume. Also can \n\nbe used to reveal the influence of consecutive magma pulses in the heterogeneous \n\ndistribution and variety of hydrothermal mineral phases; \n\n(11) The chemical stratigraphy and modeling of the magmatic evolution can also \n\nindicate the influence of continuous replenishments and heat accumulation within \n\nthis magma chamber. Already obtained chemical results are compatible with the \n\nproposed emplacement model and reveal that each magma pulse might have evolved \n\nalmost independent. In addition, layered structures recognized in the last injection \n\nmay be associated with magma unmixing in the tholeiitic line of descent. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAbramoff, M.D., Magalh\u00e3es, P.J., Ram, S.J., (2004).
