Atrav\u00e9s do \n\nestabelecimento de interac\u00e7\u00f5es entre l\u00edpidos e prote\u00ednas, quer membranares quer sol\u00faveis, \n\npodem ser originadas heterogeneidades espaciais, levando \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \u2018jangadas lip\u00eddicas\u2019. \n\nEstes dom\u00ednios transit\u00f3rios desempenham um papel fundamental em diferentes cadeias de \n\nsinaliza\u00e7\u00e3o celular. Apesar da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o desenvolvida na \u00e1rea, a membrana celular \u00e9 ainda \n\nhoje um dos componentes celulares menos bem compreendidos. \n\nNas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas t\u00eam vindo a surgir um conjunto de diferentes metodologias in vitro que \n\npermitem o estudo de variados processos biol\u00f3gicos sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es definidas e controladas. \n\nNeste sentido, foram desenvolvidos variados modelos membranares minimalistas, como GUVs \n\n(giant unillamelar vesicles), GPMVs (giant plasma membrane vesicles) and SLBs (supported \n\nlipid bilayers), permitindo a an\u00e1lise das interac\u00e7\u00f5es l\u00edpido-prote\u00edna at\u00e9 a um n\u00edvel \n\nunimolecular. Quando correctamente aplicados estes modelos permitem simplificar o sistema \n\nisolando virtualmente o fen\u00f3meno ou a part\u00edcula de interesse retendo, por\u00e9m, as suas \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas fundamentais. Apesar da vantagem evidente do uso destes modelos, estas \n\nabordagens experimentais s\u00e3o tediosas, envolvendo geralmente o uso de amostras de elevado \n\nvolume e em que a varia\u00e7\u00e3o de certas caracter\u00edsticas membranares (como a difus\u00e3o lip\u00eddica) \u00e9 \n\napenas poss\u00edvel por altera\u00e7\u00e3o da composi\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica ou da temperatura. \n\nAs monocamadas lip\u00eddicas s\u00e3o historicamente descritas como o primeiro sistema lip\u00eddico \n\nobservado, formando-se por distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea de mol\u00e9culas lip\u00eddicas sobre a interface \n\n\u00e1gua - ar e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes finos sobre superf\u00edcies. Dado o seu design \u00fanico, a mobilidade e \n\ncompacta\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica podem ser facilmente ajustadas neste sistema modelo por compress\u00e3o \n\nda monocamada depositada na interface. Apesar de o seu uso em ensaios de liga\u00e7\u00e3o proteica, \n\neste sistema tem sido negligenciado na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o membranar recente devido \u00e0 sua restrita \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o. Mais concretamente, as tinas de Langmuir comercialmente dispon\u00edveis n\u00e3o s\u00e3o \n\ncompat\u00edveis com microscopia confocal, estando assim limitadas \u00e0 monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da press\u00e3o \n\nsuperficial (?). Al\u00e9m disso, dado o volume de cada amostra relativamente elevado (cerca de \n\n100 mL), s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias elevadas quantidades de prote\u00edna purificada, comprometendo assim \n\na sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em estudos biol\u00f3gicos. \n\nNeste estudo, foi utilizada uma nova tina miniaturizada de \u00e1rea fixa, desenvolvida no grupo \n\npor Chwastek (Chwastek &amp; Schwille, 2013). As suas dimens\u00f5es reduzidas permitem n\u00e3o s\u00f3 o \n\nuso de amostras de pequeno volume (cerca de 200 \u00b5L) como tamb\u00e9m conferem a \n\nversatilidade necess\u00e1ria para o seu acoplamento a um microsc\u00f3pio confocal. Deste modo, \u00e9 \n\nposs\u00edvel aplicar t\u00e9cnicas de imagiologia de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o (permitindo a elimina\u00e7\u00e3o de ru\u00eddo de \n\nfundo, o controlo de profundidade de campo e a compila\u00e7\u00e3o de sec\u00e7\u00f5es \u00f3pticas de amostras \n\nespessas oferecido pelo microsc\u00f3pio confocal), assim como espectroscopia de correla\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nfluoresc\u00eancia (FCS \u2013 t\u00e9cnica espectrosc\u00f3pica cuja sensibilidade adv\u00e9m do uso de baixas \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de sonda e na consequente medi\u00e7\u00e3o de flutua\u00e7\u00f5es espont\u00e2neas da intensidade \n\nde fluoresc\u00eancia que resultam de desvios estoc\u00e1sticos do sistema relativamente ao seu \n\nequil\u00edbrio t\u00e9rmico). \n\n\n\n \nx \n\nO objectivo global deste projecto prende-se com a melhor compreens\u00e3o da interac\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nestabelecida entre prote\u00ednas e monocamadas lip\u00eddicas. Mais concretamente foi medida a \n\nliga\u00e7\u00e3o a monocamadas lip\u00eddicas de duas prote\u00ednas estruturalmente bem caracterizadas: a \n\nestreptavidina \u2013 prote\u00edna tetram\u00e9rica sol\u00favel com elevada afinidade de liga\u00e7\u00e3o para a biotina \n\n(KD ? 10\n-15\n\n M); e a toxina da c\u00f3lera \u2013 enterotoxina, secretada pela bact\u00e9ria Vibrio cholerae, \n\nconstitu\u00edda por um anel homo-pentam\u00e9rico de subunidades B (CtxB5), respons\u00e1vel pela sua \n\nliga\u00e7\u00e3o ao receptor membranar gangli\u00f3sido GM1 (KD ? 10\n-9\n\n ou 10\n-10\n\n M), e uma subunidade A \n\ncom actividade de ribosila\u00e7\u00e3o que \u00e9 parcialmente internalizada pelas c\u00e9lulas do hospedeiro, \n\nperturbando cascatas celulares de sinaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e desencadeando a infec\u00e7\u00e3o col\u00e9rica. Foram \n\nrealizadosensaios de liga\u00e7\u00e3o proteica a monocamadas lip\u00eddicas homog\u00e9neas e com separa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde fases, na aus\u00eancia ou presen\u00e7a dos respectivos ligandos espec\u00edficos, de modo a distinguir e \n\ncaracterizar os diferentes comportamentos proteicos. Em \u00faltima an\u00e1lise, procurou-se \n\ndesenvolver e optimizar um ensaio universal e quantitativo de liga\u00e7\u00e3o proteica a membranas \n\nlip\u00eddicas. \n\nPreviamente aos estudos das interac\u00e7\u00f5es prote\u00edna-monocamanda, procedeu-se \u00e0 \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o morfol\u00f3gica das monocamadas lip\u00eddicas, assim como da mobilidade lip\u00eddica, \n\nrecorrendo a microscopia confocal e a FCS, respectivamente. Observou-se pois que a fluidez e \n\nhomogeneidade global das monocamadas \u00e9 acompanhada pelo aumento linear do coeficiente \n\nde difus\u00e3o em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da densidade lip\u00eddica no intervalo estudado (50 a 90 MMA \u2013 \u00e1rea \n\nmolecular m\u00e9dia em \u00c5\n2\n), tal como se prev\u00ea do modelo de \u00e1rea livre (free area model). Mais, os \n\nvalores obtidos para o ponto cr\u00edtico do DMPC (36.0 \u00b1 4.7 e 37.2 \u00b1 13.5 \u00c5\n2\n em misturas \n\nmarcadas com sondas diferentes) encontram-se dentro do erro dos valores descritos na \n\nliteratura. Apesar da robustez demonstrada pelo sistema, \u00e9 por\u00e9m necess\u00e1rio ter em conta a \n\npossibilidade de ocorrerem desvios em extremos de densidade lip\u00eddica (50 e 100 MMA), por \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de fases S (s\u00f3lida) e G (g\u00e1s), respectivamente. \n\nAp\u00f3s valida\u00e7\u00e3o da metodologia proposta, procedeu-se ao estudo da influ\u00eancia da \n\ncompacta\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica na liga\u00e7\u00e3o proteica \u00e0 monocamada \u2013 quer com a estreptavidina, quer \n\ncom a CtxB5 observou-se uma prefer\u00eancia para a liga\u00e7\u00e3o a monocamadas de baixa densidade \n\nlip\u00eddica e, correspondentemente baixa ? e elevada difus\u00e3o lip\u00eddica. Estes resultados s\u00e3o ainda \n\nsuportados pelas experi\u00eancias realizadas em misturas lip\u00eddicas com separa\u00e7\u00e3o de fase \u2013 ambas \n\nas prote\u00ednas apresentam uma elevada afinidade para a fase fluida LE (liquid expanded) em \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o com os dom\u00ednios compactos LC (liquid condensed). Adicionalmente, resultados de \n\ntitula\u00e7\u00f5es de monocamadas com CtxB5 apontam para a mesma tend\u00eancia visto que a 90 MMA \n\nse obt\u00eam intensidades de fluoresc\u00eancia proteica ao n\u00edvel da monocamada superiores que a 50 \n\nMMA. Este comportamento j\u00e1 tinha sido proposto no in\u00edcio da d\u00e9cada de 80 tendo por base a \n\nan\u00e1lise de varia\u00e7\u00f5es de ? por adi\u00e7\u00e3o proteica a monocamadas lip\u00eddicas (Phillips et al, 1975; \n\nFidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982). Por\u00e9m, no caso da estreptavidina observa-se ainda um \n\ncomportamento extraordin\u00e1rio de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o nas bordas de dom\u00ednios quando a diferen\u00e7a na \n\norganiza\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica entre diferentes fases \u00e9 muito elevada. \n\nA especificidade de liga\u00e7\u00e3o foi apenas poss\u00edvel para a CtxB5 por incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de GM1 na \n\nmonocamada. Titula\u00e7\u00f5es de monocamadas demonstraram que a presen\u00e7a de uma baixa \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o do gangli\u00f3sido (0.1 mol %) \u00e9 suficiente para aumentar fortemente a liga\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nprote\u00edna \u00e0 monocamada. Al\u00e9m disso, em sistemas lip\u00eddicos homog\u00e9neos a prote\u00edna ret\u00e9m a \n\n\n\n \nxi \n\nprefer\u00eancia por baixas densidades lip\u00eddicas. Por\u00e9m, na presen\u00e7a de separa\u00e7\u00e3o de fases, a \n\npresen\u00e7a de GM1 promove a liga\u00e7\u00e3o de CtxB5 a dom\u00ednios LC, dado que este se incorpora \n\npreferencialmente em dom\u00ednios r\u00edgidos. \n\nApesar da elevada reprodutibilidade associada \u00e0s medi\u00e7\u00f5es em l\u00edpidos, a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema \n\na prote\u00ednas tem um erro associado bastante elevado que impede ainda uma quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nexacta da sua liga\u00e7\u00e3o aos l\u00edpidos. \u00c9 de salientar que para al\u00e9m da elevada sensibilidade do \n\nsistema de detec\u00e7\u00e3o usado, as monocamadas lip\u00eddicas formadas sobre a interface \u00e1gua-ar s\u00e3o \n\naltamente sens\u00edveis a diferentes factores externos (p.e. oxida\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica, forma\u00e7\u00e3o de menisco \n\ne n\u00e3o homogeneidades da compacta\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica aquando da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica, evapora\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nsubfase, deposi\u00e7\u00e3o proteica, etc.) que ainda n\u00e3o s\u00e3o totalmente controladas. Deste modo, \u00e9 \n\nainda necess\u00e1rio proceder \u00e0 optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do m\u00e9todo de modo a poder determinar-se KD da \n\nliga\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00ednas \u00e0 superf\u00edcie lip\u00eddica. \n\nEste projecto resultou pois na obten\u00e7\u00e3o de novos dados semi-quantitativos de que a \n\ncompacta\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica desempenha um papel importante na interac\u00e7\u00e3o prote\u00edna-membrana. A \n\nsepara\u00e7\u00e3o de fases surge pois como um mecanismo de regula\u00e7\u00e3o da liga\u00e7\u00e3o proteica, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 \n\npor controlo da mobilidade lip\u00eddica mas tamb\u00e9m por segrega\u00e7\u00e3o de ligandos. \n\nEm suma, a abordagem aqui proposta surge como uma alternativa poderosa para estudos de \n\ninterac\u00e7\u00f5es membrana-proteina, permitindo o f\u00e1cil ajuste de par\u00e2metros membranares como \n\na compacta\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica, dif\u00edcil de regular em sistemas de bicamadas. A sua combina\u00e7\u00e3o potente \n\ncom a microscopia confocal e espectroscopia de correla\u00e7\u00e3o de fluoresc\u00eancia resulta n\u00e3o s\u00f3 \n\nnuma elevada resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal da mobilidade de part\u00edculas lip\u00eddicas, como tamb\u00e9m na alta \n\nresolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial da liga\u00e7\u00e3o proteica. Deste modo, o trabalho apresentado contribuiu para a \n\naproxima\u00e7\u00e3o ao desenvolvimento de um novo ensaio quantitativo global de liga\u00e7\u00e3o proteica a \n\nmembranas lip\u00eddicas. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: ensaios de liga\u00e7\u00e3o proteica, microscopia confocal, FCS, compacta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nlip\u00eddica, monocamadas, interac\u00e7\u00e3o prote\u00edna-monocamada \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nxiii \n\nABSTRACT \n\nCellular membranes are composed of a wide variety of lipids and proteins which can lead to \n\nspatial heterogeneity and formation of so-called \u2018lipid rafts\u2019, which play an important role in \n\nsignaling processes. \n\nTo investigate these features of lipid bilayers various in vitro models have been developed. \n\nAlthough a variety of experimental assays exist, they very often require large samples volume, \n\nare complicated and the membrane features can be varied only by changes in lipid \n\ncomposition or temperature. \n\nHere, a fixed-area miniaturized monolayer trough was used. Due to its unique design, lipid \n\nmobility in monolayers is easily accessible while keeping other factors constant. The system \n\nutilized in this study allows the use of small sample volumes (200 \u00b5L) and can be combined \n\nwith a confocal microscope and thus providing access to high resolution imaging and sensitive \n\nfluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) technique. \n\nThe goal of the project was to design a quantitative assay by which protein-monolayer \n\ninteractions can be studied. Thus, monolayers were investigated in terms of morphology and \n\nlipid mobility. Further, interactions of well-known ligand-protein pairs were studied: cholera \n\ntoxin (Ctx)/ganglioside GM1 and streptavidin/biotin. The influences of phase separation and \n\npresence of lipid ligands were investigated. \n\nIt was shown that the membrane affinities of cholera toxin B (CtxB5) and streptavidin depend \n\non the surface density of lipid molecules. Moreover, FCS measurements indicate a correlation \n\nbetween higher protein binding and increased lipid mobility. When phase separated lipid \n\nmonolayers were used, both proteins bound preferentially to liquid expanded phase (LE). \n\nHowever, in case of CtxB5, in the presence of the ganglioside, the protein mostly binds to the \n\nliquid condensed phase (LC). \n\nIn summary, protein binding to lipid monolayers was studied by means of fluorescence \n\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy. During the studies, an appropriate methodology was developed \n\nand several experimental scenarios were tested. \n\n \n\nKey words: protein binding assay, confocal microscopy, FCS, lipid packing, monolayers, \n\nprotein-monolayer interaction \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nxv \n\nCONTENTS \n\n \n\nFORWARD ................................................................................................................................................................ v \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ................................................................................................................................. vii \n\nRESUMO .................................................................................................................................................................. ix \n\nABSTRACT ........................................................................................................................................................... xiii \n\n \n\nMOTIVATION ........................................................................................................................................................ 1 \n\nGoal ........................................................................................................................................................................ 1 \n\nI.

It consists of a protoplasm, enclosed within a lipid membrane. At the \n\nmolecular level, cells are composed of proteins, the so-called 'cellular tools' and nucleic acids \n\nknown as a 'hereditary database'. From complex networking between these components \n\nemerge vital functions, which allow cells to sense and react to changes taking place in the \n\nenvironment. This versatility enables cells to evolve and organize into various organisms, \n\nwhich could successfully survive an evolutionary pressure. \n\nTherefore, a better understanding of the biochemical and biophysical nature of individual \n\ncomponents of the cell and their interactions is fundamental for broadening the knowledge of \n\nthe principles of life. Due to the complexity of biological systems, one has to apply a \n\nreductionist approach, by which the system is simplified to such an extent that the \n\ncomponent/phenomenon of interest is virtually isolated but still retains its main features. \n\nCell membrane, especially its organization and the role in fundamental cellular processes, is \n\nprobably one of the least understood components of the cell. Even though great \n\nadvancements have taken place in this field of research over the last three decades, \n\ninteractions between lipid membranes and a variety of integral and peripheral membrane-\n\nbinding proteins are still far from being fully understood. \n\nGOAL \n\nThus, the general aim of this project was a better understanding of the interaction of proteins \n\nwith lipid monolayers. More specifically, the binding of two well-characterized proteins \n\n(cholera toxin \u2013 Ctx, and streptavidin) to lipid monolayers was measured. A new, miniaturized \n\nmonolayer setup was used to manipulate lipid packing and to investigate its influence on \n\nprotein binding to lipid monolayers. Particularly, the project was focused on improvement and \n\ndevelopment of the monolayer technique by combining it with confocal microscopy and \n\nfluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The aim was to make protein-binding assays used in \n\nother model membrane systems available to lipid monolayers.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n3 \n\nI. THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION \n\n1. CELL MEMBRANE \n\nSince the 20th century, lipid membrane is no longer recognized as a simple physical barrier \n\nwhich separates intracellular and extracellular environments, and defines diverse intracellular \n\norganelles (Gennis, 1989), but rather as a sophisticated organelle itself which directly or \n\nindirectly participates in a variety of cellular processes such as protein and lipid synthesis, \n\nmetabolite transport and cell signaling. \n\nNowadays, scientists focus on the structural diversity of biological membranes, the asymmetry \n\nof lipid distribution between membrane leaflets and lateral heterogeneity of lipid bilayers in \n\norder to propose a coherent view of the cell membrane, which will cover the major biological \n\naspects of this organelle (de Almeida &amp; Loura, 2004). It is widely accepted that the cell \n\nmembrane is structurally composed of two lipid leaflets (hence its name \u2013 the lipid bilayer) \n\n(Gorter &amp; Grendel, 1925). Moreover, it contains almost 50 % w/w of proteins in its lipid core \n\n(Singer &amp; Nicolson, 1972) and shows structural and functional heterogeneity, as proposed by \n\nthe so called \u2018lipid-raft model\u2019 (Simons &amp; Ikonen, 1997) \u2013 fig. 1. \n\n \n\nFig. 1: Schematic representation of the \u2018lipid-raft\u2019 model. (van Meer et al, 2008). \n\n*1.1. PROTEIN INTERACTION WITH LIPID MEMBRANES \n\nProteins are polymers of amino-acids folded in a unique manner which defines their function \n\nand specificity. Several levels of protein organization can be distinguished. At a first level, \n\nindividual amino-acids are covalently attached through amide linkage forming polypeptide \n\nsequences. An amino-acid sequence then folds due to free rotation of the amino and acid \n\ngroups and consequent interaction between close neighbors (mainly hydrogen bonds) forming \n\nsecondary motifs (fig. 2.A) \u2013 ?-helix, ?-sheet and ?-turns. Further folding is driven by \n\nhydrophobic forces and stabilized by salt bridges and disulfide bonds, which bring in close \n\nproximity distant parts of the sequence (fig. 2.B). The overall structure of the protein is \n\ntherefore dependent on the size, orientation and specific amino-acid sequence, determining \n\n\n\nTheoretical Introduction \n\n \n\n \n4 \n\nthe general function of the protein. While there are plenty of small monomeric proteins, some \n\nof these can be used as subunits to form major complex multi-domain structures. In many \n\ncases, the subunits preserve their original function and the resulting protein complex exhibits \n\nincreased functionality (fig. 2.C). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2: Levels of protein organization. A. Schematic representation of common secondary structure \u2013 ?-\n\nhelix (left), ?-sheet (center) and ?-turn (right).

Adapted from (Nelson &amp; Cox, 2004). B. 3D representation of \n\nhemoglobin ? subunit tertiary structure. C. Quaternary structure of hemoglobin. Blue and green depict ? \n\nand ? subunit respectively (PDB ID 1GZX). \n\nThe wide variety of proteins found in the cell takes part in a complex network of interactions \n\nwhich very often are responsible for the sensing and transduction of signals from and into the \n\ncell. Therefore, in the membrane, one can find different sets of integral and membrane-\n\nanchoring proteins which facilitate those processes. Integral membrane proteins are \n\nembedded in the lipid bilayer through hydrophobic domains such as ? barrels or ? helix \n\nbundles (fig. 3). On the other hand, anchoring proteins are soluble proteins with membrane \n\nbinding domains which allow them to bind directly or indirectly to the lipid interface. \n\nIn nature, a variety of membrane binding domains has evolved and they are an essential part \n\nof proteins like protein kinase C (PKC) (Takai et al, 1979), epsin (Ford et al, 2001) and \n\namphiphysin (Lichte et al, 1992). Although different binding domains have the same \n\nfunctionality, the anchoring mechanism to the membrane can be different. For example, \n\nplekstrin homology domain (PH) specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol (PI) by amphipatic \n\nhelixes (Manna et al, 2007) while FYVE domains do it through coordinated zinc ions (Gaullier et \n\nal, 1998). Epsin N-terminal homology domain (ENTH) binds specifically to PI(4,5)P2 by positively \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n5 \n\ncharged pockets in its structure (Ford et al, 2001). On the other hand, BAR domains (Bin-\n\nAmphiphysin-Rvs) can interact with the membrane through electrostatic interaction (Henne et \n\nal, 2007) or anchor to the bilayer through rather hydrophobic amino acid residues (Gallop et al, \n\n2006). Besides the \u2018specific\u2019 nature of membrane-protein interaction, one should take into \n\naccount rather unspecific interactions raised by the chemical nature of both components. \n\n     \n\nFig. 3: 3D structure of membrane integral proteins.

Staphylococcus aureus hemolysin toxin (PDB ID 7AHL) \u2013 the membrane-binding domain is a 14-\nstranded ?-barrel. Addapted from (Nelson &amp; Cox, 2004). \n\n- 1.1.1. CHOLERA TOXIN \n\nCholera toxin (Ctx) is the enterotoxin secreted by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, resulting in \n\nthe massive fluid release characteristic to the cholera infection (Middlebrook &amp; Dorland, \n\n1984). This toxin exhibits a heterohexameric ??5 arrangement (Mr = 85.620 kDa) (fig. 4). The \n\nfive identical ? subunits (CtxB5) (fig. 4.A) which are arranged in a highly stable pentameric ring \n\n(Zhang et al, 1995), are responsible for the toxin binding to the cell surface. The natural \n\nreceptor of the toxin is a sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipid \u2013 ganglioside GM1 (fig. 5) which \n\nis localized on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells (Sattler et al, 1978). The five \n\nbinding sites are equivalent and have a dissociation constant (KD) in the order of 10\n-9\n\n / 10\n-10 \n\nM \n\n(Fishman et al, 1978; Ludwig et al, 1986; Reed et al, 1987). The ? subunit of Ctx is a loosely \n\nfolded chain composed of disulfide-linked segments ?1 and ?2 aligned through the central \n\nCtxB5 pore that has ADP-ribosilation activity (fig. 4.C). The ? chain is cleaved by bacterial \n\nendoprotease prior to internalization (Tomasi et al, 1979) and the ?1 peptide crosses the cell \n\nmembrane (Mekalanos et al, 1979) and disrupts cell signaling cascades (Holmgren, 1981; \n\nGalloway &amp; van Heyningen, 1987; Peterson &amp; Ochoa, 1989). \n\nTherefore, CtxB5 binding to GM1 is widely studied as a model of multivalent lipid-protein \n\nbinding (e.g. Shi et al, 2007; Sorre et al, 2009). The specificity of the interaction also allows the \n\nuse of CtxB5  as a tool in GM1 distribution studies in different lipid membrane models (e.g. Rock \n\net al, 1991; de Almeida et al, 2005). Additionally, due to apparent preferential distribution of \n\nGM1 into ordered phases (Vi\u00e9 et al, 1998; Yuan &amp; Johnston, 2000; Menke et al, 2002) cholera \n\n\n\nTheoretical Introduction \n\n \n\n \n6 \n\ntoxin is used as a lipid raft marker (e.g. de Almeida et al, 2005; Schafer &amp; Marrink, 2010; Stefl \n\net al, 2012). \n\n \n\nFig. 4: Cholera toxin (Ctx) 3D structure.

STREPTAVIDIN \n\nStreptavidin, the bacterial equivalent of the hen egg-white protein avidin, is a tetrameric \n\nprotein (fig. 6) with extraordinary ligand binding affinity (Kd ? 10\n-15\n\n M) (Chaiet &amp; Wolf, 1964) to \n\nbiotin (fig. 7). Each monomer is folded in a simple ?-barrel structure (fig. 6.A) with eight \n\nstrands in a right-handed helical course and it is stabilized through hydrogen-bonds \n\n(Hendrickson et al, 1989). The quaternary structure with dihedral D2 molecular symmetry \n\narises from intermolecular hydrophobic interactions between specific segments of ?-strands in \n\neach monomer. Biotin binds streptavidin quite deeply in the barrel and only carboxylate \n\noxygens and ureido-ring nitrogen protrude to the outside. Carboxylate groups of biotins bound \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 6: Streptavidin 3D structure. A. \n\nIndividual subunits present a simple \n\n?-barrel conformation. B.

This \n\nstructural characteristic might impose a limit to the nature of conjugating groups used in \n\ndifferent binding assays. Many evidences from the native X-ray structure and different point \n\nmutation approaches suggest that biotin binding is stabilized by numerous van der Waals \n\ninteractions and hydrogen-bonds evolving the numerous tryptophan residues buried in the \n\nbarrels (e.g. Hendrickson et al, 1989; Sano &amp; Cantor, 1995; Hyre et al, 2006). \n\nThe biological function of streptavidin and avidin is poorly understood and most of the studies \n\non these proteins are performed for a better understanding of the chemical basis of the \n\nextreme avidity for biotin and its exploitation in several biotechnological applications, as well \n\nas their optimization (e.g. Diamandis &amp; Christopoulos, 1991; Livnah et al, 1993; Nordlund et al, \n\n2003; Laitinen et al, 2007; Vogel &amp; Schwille, 2012; Heinemann et al, 2013). \n\n2. LIPID SYSTEMS FOR IN VITRO STUDIES \n\nIn the last few decades, a number of in vitro methods have been developed that allow the \n\ninvestigation of different biological processes under defined and controlled conditions. A \n\nvariety of minimal membrane systems (reviewed in Arumugam et al, 2011), as giant \n\nunilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (Angelova &amp; Dimitrov, 1986; Merkle et al, 2008; Herold et al, 2012), \n\nsupported lipid bilayers (SLBs) (Tamm &amp; McConnell, 1985; Chiantia et al, 2006) and lipid \n\nmonolayers (Fidelio et al, 1981; McConnell et al, 1984; Bianco et al, 1989; Brockman, 1999), \n\nallow the study of lipid-protein interactions down to a single-molecule level. These systems, \n\nthough highly simplified in their composition and topography, when properly employed, retain \n\nthe core of the interaction under investigation and minimize the number of variables in the \n\nanalysis. \n\n* 2.1. LIPID ORGANIZATION \n\nLipids are a broad group of naturally occurring molecules which include fats, waxes, sterols, \n\nvitamins, mono-, di- and triglycerides and phospholipids. The major components of lipid \n\nmembranes are phospholipids and sterols (fig. 8). The exact composition of the lipid bilayer is \n\nnot only greatly variable between species, but it can be also specific to particular tissues in the \n\nsame organism and even asymmetric between both leaflets of the same lipid bilayer. \n\nMembranes are formed by spontaneous self-organization of lipid molecules. Due to their \n\namphipathic nature \u2013 these molecules have one polar group which coordinates preferentially \n\nwith the water (hydrophilic) and one non-polar group (fig. 8), which is buried in the \n\nhydrophobic core of the bilayer. The character of the lipid molecule depends therefore on the \n\nbalance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic moiety of the lipid. Hence a common way to \n\ncharacterize lipids is through the determination of the partitioning coefficient of a particular \n\nlipid in between oil-water suspension. \n\n\n\nTheoretical Introduction \n\n \n\n \n8 \n\n \n\nFig. 8: Structure of representative molecules of common membrane lipid groups \u2013 A. DOPC \n\n(phospholipid) and B. Cholesterol (sterol). Lipid amphipathic nature is depicted by different colors \u2013 red \n\nfor hydrophobic regions and blue for polar areas. \n\nBesides the amphipathicity of lipid molecules, another factor playing an important role in the \n\nmembrane assembly is a theoretical lipid shape. It is called 'shape factor' S and it depends on \n\nmolecule dimensions as well as on the chemical nature of the headgroup, according to: \n\n                   (eq. 1) \n\nwhere V is the volume of the molecule, A0 is the \u2018optimal\u2019 area of the lipid headgroup taking \n\ninto account its dimensions and chemical properties of the molecule and LC is the length of the \n\nstraight acyl chain. Pure lipids of different shapes form spontaneously different phases (fig. 9): \n\nwhen S > 1 (conical shape) the inverted HII phase is favorable (inverted micelle); for S = 1 \n\n(cylindrical shape), lamellar structures as bilayers are formed; when S &lt;1 (inverted conical \n\nshape) micelles are formed. A0 parameter is mostly dependent on the molecules charge, which \n\ncan change with the protonation state of the head group. Hence it is directly related to the pH. \n\nOn the other hand, in case of phospholipids, the LC and AH parameters are mainly dependent \n\non the saturation of the acyl chains. In nature, membranes are formed by a wide variety of \n\nlipid species of different shape factors. Therefore, it is plausible to form lamellar structures by \n\ncompensation of conical shapes of one lipid species by the inverted conical shape of another, \n\nresulting in a net S ~ 1. \n\n \n\nFig. 9: Lipid structure features. A. Schematic orientation of A0, AH and Lc parameters relatively to the \n\nlipid molecule. B. Representation of lipids with different shape factor S \u2013 cone shaped (left), cylindrical \n\nshape (center) and inverted cone shape (right). (Chwastek, 2013) \n\nThe properties of the lamellar phase formed by lipids are temperature dependent. Thus, it is \n\npossible to distinguish different lipid organizational order, so called 'phases' (fig. 10) \u2013 fluid or \n\nliquid disordered (ld), gel phase or ordered solid (gel) and liquid ordered phase (lo). Under \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n9 \n\nphysiological conditions, the most representative phase of biological membranes is the ld \n\nphase. The bilayer in this phase is relatively thinner and lipid molecules show high lateral \n\nmobility. Lipid chains are mostly in a gauche conformation or have cis-double bonds which \n\nlead to a less tight packing in the plain of the membrane and an apparent shortening of the \n\nacyl chains (de Almeida &amp; Loura, 2004). With the lowering of the temperature, at certain point \n\n(called phase transition temperature - Tm), lipids undergo change in their packing which results \n\nin an abrupt reduction of the acyl chain mobility. The highest order of lipid takes place in the \n\nso-called gel phase. In this phase, the thickness of the membrane is maximal and lipids are \n\ntightly packed due to the presence of ordered acyl chains in trans conformation. This leads to \n\nalmost complete arrest of lateral lipid diffusion. The intermediate lo phase, on the other hand, \n\nthough it is characterized by a high lipid order, still retains lipid diffusion (Chiantia et al, 2006). \n\nIn contrast to gel and ld phases that are found for all pure lipids, lo phase is characteristic of \n\nmixed bilayers, especially those containing sterols. Generally, this phase forms domains, so \n\ncalled 'lipid rafts', in a ld matrix. There is a growing number of evidence pointing towards the \n\nbiological importance of this phenomenon, especially as an important mechanism in the \n\nregulation of signaling pathways in the cell (Simons &amp; Ikonen, 1997). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 10: Schematic representation of different membrane phases \u2013 A. gel, B. ld and C. lo phases. Adapted \n\nfrom (Franquelim, 2012). \n\n* 2.2. LIPID MONOLAYERS \n\nHistorically, lipid monolayers are described as the first lipid systems which originate from the \n\nnatural lipid spreading at the water-air interface and thin layer formation over available \n\nsurfaces (reviewed in Dynarowicz-Latka et al, 2001). The major advances in the field occurred \n\nduring the 19th century: Irving Langmuir studied the surface pressure dependence on \n\nmolecular density of individual lipids at the water-air interface and, with Katherine Blodgett, \n\ndeveloped the lipid film transfer method on to solid surfaces \u2013 Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. \n\nDespite the technological and scientific advances which took place in the field in the 20th \n\n\n\nTheoretical Introduction \n\n \n\n \n10 \n\ncentury, the principle of the method remains the same \u2013 molecules with amphipathic \n\nproperties, when deposited on a water-air interface, spontaneously orient themselves in a way \n\nthat minimizes the overall energy of the system, i.e. the more hydrophilic part of the molecule \n\ncoordinates with the water subphase whereas the hydrophobic part sticks out towards the air \n\n(fig. 11).  \n\nModern Langmuir-Blodgett troughs are composed of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) \n\ncontainer, movable barriers and a micro-balance (fig. 12). The surface pressure (?) is measured \n\nthrough a thin plate of platinum or ash-free filter paper (called Wilhelmy plate) attached to the \n\nmicro-balance and immersed in the subphase (Martin &amp; Szablewski, 2004). When the ? of the \n\nmonolayer varies, the Wilhelmy plate is exposed to the corresponding force (F) given by \n\nequation 2, generated by the surface tension (ST) change due to rearrangement of lipid \n\npacking: \n\n  (     )  (     )   (   )(  )          (eq. 2) \n\nwhere ?P and ?L are respectively the plate and subphase densities, l/w/t \n\n(length/width/thickness) are the plate dimensions, dwt (where d is the depth of immersion) \n\nare the upthrust volume (fig. 13), g represents the gravity and the last term describes the \n\nchange in ST. Since ? is the change in surface tension and the sum of both these parameters is \n\nconstant, it is thus possible to follow ? variation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 11: Schematic representation of lipid deposition on an air-\n\nwater interface, forming a lipid monolayer. Subphase water \n\nmolecules penetrate the monolayer to some extent coordinating \n\nwith the polar headgroups. The hydrophobic acyl chains are \n\ncompletely excluded from water subphase sticking out towards \n\nthe air. (Chwastek, 2013) \n\n \n\nFig. 12: 3D schematic representation of a classical Langmuir-Blodgett trough with its main components. \n\n(Chwastek, 2013) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n11 \n\nThus, knowing that ST in standard conditions is 72.8 mN/m, it is possible to calculate ?. As the \n\nweight plate and the upthrust (first and second term respectively) are constant during the \n\nmeasurement and ? (contact angle of the subphase to the plate) is 0 \no\n for Wilhelmy plates, eq. \n\n2 can be simplified to eq.3: \n\n                            (eq. 3) \n\nAlthough the system lacks essential features of a biological membrane, it enables a fine tuning \n\nof parameters hardly accessible for a constant lipid composition in bilayer assays \u2013 such as lipid \n\npacking and surface pressure \u2013 which are of great relevance for every lipid-protein interaction. \n\nDespite the validation of lipid monolayers in protein binding assays (Brockman, 1999), this \n\nclassical model system has rather been neglected in recent membrane research due to its \n\nrestricted applications. Importantly, most of the commercially available troughs are not \n\ncompatible with confocal microscopes, being limited to ? monitoring. On the other hand, the \n\nrelatively big subphase volume needed for each monolayer experiment (? 100 mL) demands \n\nhuge amounts of purified protein, which renders the applicability in biological studies. Despite \n\nthe possibility of overcoming these problems through LB films usage, their properties might be \n\ninfluenced by both the solid support and the transfer process. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 13: Schematic representation of \n\nWilhelmy plate \u2013 its dimensions and \n\ncontact angle with the subphase. \n\n(Chwastek, 2013) \n\n \n\n* 2.3. NEW MINIATURIZED SYSTEM \n\nVery recently, Chwastek and Schwille proposed a small and versatile monolayer setup which \n\nallows the combination of confocal microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with \n\nlipid monolayers (fig. 14) (Chwastek &amp; Schwille, 2013). \n\nThis setup is constituted of a PTFE spacer, with a hole of 15 mm diameter, glued to a glass \n\ncover slip. A small volume of subphase (? 200 \u00b5L) is added to the chamber on top of which \n\ndefined volumes of chloroform lipid solutions are deposited and form lipid monolayers (see \n\nMethods; fig. 15). This small chamber volume renders it useful for application in protein-\n\nbinding assays as well, in which only limited amount of material is available. On the other \n\nhand, in contrast to standard monolayer technique, where ? measurement is performed, the \n\nphysical state of the monolayer is monitored by measurement of the diffusion coefficient (D) \n\nthrough fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (see section 3.3. and Methods). This \n\nparameter is commonly used to characterize lipid packing in model membrane systems (Kahya \n\net al, 2003; Chiantia et al, 2009). In monolayers, it has been theoretically predicted (Galla et al, \n\n1979) and experimentally shown (Gudmand et al, 2009) that D varies linearly with the mean \n\n\n\nTheoretical Introduction \n\n \n\n \n12 \n\nmolecular area (MMA) of lipids in a monolayer far from phase transition, thus allows to control \n\nthe state of the system. \n\n \n\nFig. 14: 3D projection of the micro-chamber.

FLUORESCENCE-BASED METHODS \n\nCurrent biological research is highly focused on the physico-chemical characterization of \n\nelementary processes at the level of single molecules. Among techniques used in these \n\nstudies, highly sensitive and non-invasive fluorescence-based methods are one of the most \n\npopular. \n\n* 3.1. FLUORESCENCE \n\nAll substances absorb energy in form of light resulting in the excitation of molecules or atoms \n\nto a higher quantum state. The spontaneous relaxation to the ground state is accompanied by \n\nlight emission \u2013 luminescence. According to Jablonski\u2019s diagram (fig. 16.A), depending on the \n\nquantum nature of the relaxation phenomena, luminescence can be classified in \n\nphosphorescence and fluorescence. Phosphorescence occurs in the millisecond to second time \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n13 \n\nscale and results from the intersystem crossing conversion (ICC) to the triplet state. \n\nFluorescence, on the other hand, is a much faster process \u2013 in the nanosecond regime \u2013 which \n\nis the result of the relaxation from a singlet excited state to the ground state S0. (Reviewed in \n\nValeur, 2002; Lakowicz, 2006) \n\nThe energy of the emitted photons is in general lower than the absorbed one due to fast non-\n\nradiative internal conversion (IC), not only from S2 to S1 states but also from higher vibrational \n\nstates to the ground level of S1. Moreover, the relaxation often occurs to higher vibrational \n\nlevels of S0. This energy loss results in a red shift of the emission spectrum relative to the \n\nexcitation spectrum known as Stokes\u2019 shift (fig. 16.B). \n\n \n\nFig. 16: A. Jablonski diagram. Light absorption is accompanied by atom/molecule excitation to one of the \n\nvibration levels (depicted by 0, 1, 2 and 3) of the singlet excited states S1 (b) or S2 (a). Excited molecules \n\nundergo internal conversion (IC) to the ground vibrational level of S1 (c). From S1 further relaxation can \n\noccur by direct light emission through fluorescence (d) or intersystem crossing conversion (ICC) to the \n\ntriplet state T1 I, a much slower process. From T1, energy is released as phosphorescence. Both \n\nphenomena might be therefore distinguished by their lifetime \u2013 in the nanosecond time scale for \n\nfluorescence compared to the second time scale for phosphorescence. B. Emission and excitation \n\nspectra for a fluorophore. The red shift of the emission spectra (Stoke\u2019s shift) are due to the energy loss \n\nin the non-radiative processes (IC and ICC). (Chwastek, 2013) \n\nThe main parameters, which should be considered when using fluorescent probes in biological \n\nstudies are the absorption cross-section, quantum yield (Q) and fluorescence lifetime which \n\nshould be suitable to the experimental design. The quantum yield is given by the ratio of the \n\nnumber of emitted photons (Dr \u2013 rate of S1 to S0 decay) to the total number of observed \n\nphotons (Dr + Dnon, where Dnon is the rate of all the processes leading to non-radiative energy \n\ndissipation) \u2013 eq. 4. Fluorescence lifetime is the average time which molecules/atoms stay in \n\nthe excited state. Moreover, for membrane probing, both in vivo and in vitro, fluorescent dyes \n\nmust be amphipathic or hydrophobic in order to incorporate into lipid membranes allowing its \n\ncharacterization. The partition coefficient (Kp) is often used to report probes preference to \n\nincorporate into lipid membranes or specific lipid phases. \n\n  \n  \n\n       \n           (eq. 4) \n\n \n\n\n\nTheoretical Introduction \n\n \n\n \n14 \n\n* 3.2. Confocal microscopy \n\nThe basic concept of confocal microscopy was originally developed by Marvin Minsky in the \n\nmiddle of 16th century. In 1979, G. Fred Brakhenhoff developed the first scanning confocal \n\nmicroscope and two decades later appeared the first commercial instruments. Since then, \n\nmany technological and theoretical advances were made to improve resolution and versatility \n\nof confocal microscopes. (Reviewed in Claxton et al, 2005) \n\nThough confocal microscopy provides only a marginal improvement in both axial and lateral \n\noptical resolution, the greatest innovation over widefield microscopy is the elimination of out-\n\nof-focus light or glare in thick samples (over the immediate plane of focus) through the use of \n\nspatial filtering techniques. Thus, the laser beam (excitation source) passes through a pinhole \n\naperture localized in a confocal conjugate plane with the scanning point in the sample and a \n\nsecond pinhole aperture positioned in front of the photomultiplier tube (detector) \u2013 fig. 17.A. \n\nDuring sample scanning with the laser, reflected by a dichromatic mirror, secondary \n\nfluorescence emitted from points on the sample pass back through the dichromatic mirror and \n\nare focused as a confocal point at the detector pinhole aperture. As only a small fraction of the \n\nout-of-focus emission is delivered through the pinhole aperture, being rather projected onto \n\nthe aperture as Airy disks. Therefore, most of this extraneous light is not detected by the \n\nphotomultiplier and does not contribute in the image formation. \n\nImportantly, the focusing mechanism of laser illumination in confocal microscopy also allows \n\nreduction the focal volume (fig. 17.B) \u2013 the laser light is first expanded to fill the objective rear \n\naperture, and then focused by the lens system to a very small point in the focal plane. \n\n \n\nFig. 17: A. Schematic representation of the optical \n\npathway and the main components in a laser \n\nscanning confocal microscope. B. Widefield versus \n\nconfocal microscopy illumination volumes, \n\ndemonstrating the difference between widefield \n\nexcitation and point scanning light beams. (Claxton \n\net al, 2005) \n\n \n\nIn laser scanning confocal microscopy the focused beam is scanned across the defined sample \n\narea in a raster pattern controlled by two-high speed oscillating mirrors driven with \n\ngalvanometer motors, allowing for the formation of images of extended samples. \n\nIn the whole, confocal microscopy is advantageous over conventional widefield optical \n\nmicroscopy as it offers the ability to control depth of field, to eliminate or highly reduce the \n\nbackground information and to collect serial optical sections from thick samples. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n15 \n\n* 3.3. FLUORESCENCE CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY \n\nFluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) principle was introduced for the first time by \n\nMagde, Elson and Webb in 1972 (Reviewed in Schwille &amp; Haustein, 2002). Unlike other \n\nfluorescence techniques, FCS primary parameter of interest is not the fluorescence intensity \n\nbut rather its fluctuations which appear due to the system stochastic deviations from thermal \n\nequilibrium. Therefore, FCS is based on the time correlation of fluorescent signal fluctuations \n\ninduced by the fluorophore movement in and out of the detection volume (fig. 18). The \n\nacquired signal is characteristic to particular particle species and conditions. In order to resolve \n\nthe movement of single molecules, measurements are usually conducted at very low dye \n\nconcentration to avoid the saturation of the detection volume. The implementation of \n\nconfocal detection to the FCS setup by Rigler and co-workers allowed the reduction of the \n\ndetection volume below one femtoliter (Rigler et al, 1999). The consequent reduction of the \n\naverage number of detected molecules enables FCS measurement at higher biologically \n\nrelevant concentrations. Its applicability is nonetheless limited by the resolution scale (> 200 \n\nnm) and still sets an upper limit for label concentrations. An alternative arises from the \n\ncombination of FCS and fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (FIDA) with sub-diffraction-\n\nresolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy (Kastrup et al, 2005; Ringemann et \n\nal, 2009). This approach, with an effective observational area down to 20-30 nm in diameter \n\n(note that the selective deactivation of fluorophores accomplished by double pulse of light \n\nenables image enhancement in the region), allows the study of nano-scale dynamics and may \n\nbe applied to larger, often endogenous concentrations. \n\n \n\nFig. 18: Principles of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). A. Fluorophores (grey) diffuse \n\nrandomly into the focal spot (pink) where the laser beam (red) is strongly focused. Fluorophores start \n\nimmediately to emit light (green) as a result of the absorbed energy. B. Detected signal is directly \n\nrelated to the number of fluorescent molecules in the focal spot. (Numbers at the graph correspond to \n\nthe numbers at the drawings.) (Chwastek, 2013) \n\nIn theory, the fluorescence fluctuations ?F(t) are deviations from the average fluorescence \n\nsignal and corresponds to the average number of particles. \n\n  ( )   ( )   ( )           (eq. 5) \n\nAutocorrelation of the signal over time translates the temporal similarity of the signal intensity \n\ninto its characteristic decay. \n\n ( )  \n  ( )  (   ) \n\n  ( )  \n          (eq. 6) \n\n\n\nTheoretical Introduction \n\n \n\n \n16 \n\nAssuming that fluorophores undergo Brownian motion, one can conclude that the number of \n\nmolecules in the focal volume, hence the fluorescence intensity, depends strongly on the \n\nmobility of particles. Therefore, fluorophore diffusion determines the characteristic decay of \n\nthe temporal autocorrelation function. \n\nThe detection volume \u2013 effective focal volume Veff \u2013 is a three dimensional Gaussian \n\napproximation (eq. 7), where r0 is the waist of the focal spot at which the Gaussian \n\napproximation of the emitted light decays to 1/e\n2\n and z0 is the dimension along the z axis. \n\n      \n \n\n    \n              (eq. 7) \n\nThe autocorrelation function which describes the diffusion of fluorescent specie has a \n\nfollowing form \n\n ( )  \n \n\n       \n(  \n\n \n\n  \n)  (  \n\n \n  \n  \n\n \n  \n\n)   ?        (eq. 8) \n\nwhere Veff<C> is the average number of molecules&lt;N> in the focal volume and ?D is the \n\ncharacteristic diffusion time of the fluorescent species. By knowing the diffusion coefficient of \n\nthe molecule it is possible to estimate the dimension of Veff using the relation:  \n\n   \n  \n \n\n  \n           (eq. 9) \n\nFurther, by bringing together the number of particles and the estimated detection volume one \n\ncan extrude the concentration of the fluorophore (eq. 10). \n\n ( )  \n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n        \n         (eq. 10) \n\nFor a more accurate description of the fluorescence signal fluctuations, besides molecule \n\nmotion, one needs to consider other fluorescence aspects that might interfere with the \n\nmeasured signal (fig. 19). \n\nThe inherent fluorophore blinking due to ICC from S1 to T1 interferes with fluctuation arose \n\nfrom lateral mobility of the fluorophore. This phenomenon can be taken into account in the \n\nautocorrelation function  \n\n( )  \n \n\n   \n(  \n\n \n\n   \n     ? )(  \n\n \n\n  \n)  (  \n\n \n\n    \n)   ?       (eq. 11) \n\nwhere T corresponds to the triplet fraction, ?T the diffusion time, S is the structural parameter \n\ndefined by the ratio     ?  and the triplet blinking is described by an exponential decay \n\n(Schwille et al, 2000). This three dimensional model can be also applied to two dimensional \n\nsituation (like in case of lipid membrane) since S approaches zero: \n\n( )  \n \n\n   \n(  \n\n \n\n   \n     ? )(  \n\n \n\n  \n)          (eq. 12) \n\nAs a result the detection volume in this two dimensional model is approximated by a circle \n\nallowing to exclude the third term of the 3D model. Notice that thermal instability of the \n\nmembrane may induce additional fluorescence fluctuation in the 2D situation especially when \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n17 \n\napplied to free-standing membranes which might move in and out of the focal spot. Thus an \n\nadditional component describing these fluctuations (F fraction with ?F diffusion time) should be \n\nused (Petrov &amp; Schwille, 2008) \u2013 eq. 13. \n\n( )  \n \n\n   \n(  \n\n \n\n   \n     ? )(\n\n \n\n     ?\n \n\n   \n\n     ?\n)        (eq. 13) \n\n \n\nFig. 19: Influence of different factor on the shape of the autocorrelation curve. A. An autocorrelation \n\ncurve presents characteristic amplitude G(0) and ?1 diffusion time \u2013 (a). In presence of higher \n\nconcentration of the same fluorophore specie (b), even though the overall signal increases, the \n\namplitude of the correlation drops (G\u2019(0)) accordingly with the equations 8 and 10. Importantly, the \n\ncharacteristic diffusion time is retained. On the other hand, a fluorophore in the same concentration as \n\nin (a) but with lower mobility will raise a curve with the same amplitude G(0) but shifted towards longer \n\ndiffusion times \u2013 (c). B. Influence of triplet blinking and membrane undulations \u2013 for a fluorophore with \n\na characteristic diffusion time ?D (b), its triplet state will appear at shorter lag times (?T \u2013 (a)), as blinking \n\nis a much faster process in comparison to lateral diffusion of the molecule; the relatively slow process of \n\nmembrane undulations will give rise to and additional slow component \u2013 ?F (c).

In figure 1 are \n\nrepresented the spectra of the dyes used in the main studies. Consumables and machinery are \n\nindicated in the next sections. \n\n2. LIPID HANDLING \n\nLipids were stored at -20 \no\nC in chloroform (1.02447.0500 \u2013 Merck kGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) \n\nfilled with argon to prevent oxidation and sealed with silicon tape to prevent evaporation. On a \n\ndaily basis, the lipid concentration was estimated by gravimetric method. Stock solution \n\nconcentrations which were suspected to be changed over time were determined using \n\nRouser\u2019s modified method. \n\n3. ROUSER\u2019S METHOD \n\nThis method is based on molibdate ability to form complexes with free phosphorus under \n\nacidic conditions. Phospholipids are decomposed into CO2, H2O and PO3\n4-\n\n when incubated at \n\nhigh temperature in perchloric acid. The resulting orthophosphate forms phosphomolybdate \n\n(VI) [(NH4)3Pmo12O40] in presence of molybdenum ammonium under acidic conditions. This \n\ncompound is reduced by ascorbic acid to a mixture of molybdenum oxides (IV) and (VI) MoO2 x \n\nMoO3 \u2013 molybdenum blue. The amount of the later is estimated by absorption measurement. \n\nNote that this method cannot be used to measure lipid suspensions containing phosphates as \n\nall the inorganic phosphorus will contribute for the total mass of measured phosphorus. \n\nLipids (10 to 100nmols) were pipetted to glass test-tubes. After complete solvent evaporation, \n\n500 \u00b5L of water and 300 \u00b5L of perchloric acid were added. Short vortexing was proceeded by a \n\n3 hour incubation time at 180 \no\nC to assure full lipid mineralization and complete phosphorus \n\nrelease. \n\n \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n \n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nFig. 1: Chemical structures and optical spectra of the used main fluorescence dyes \u2013 Chol 542 (A), DiO \n\n(B), Alexa 488 (C) and Alexa 647 (D).

Adapted from \n\nwww.invitrogen.com \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n21 \n\nAfter incubation, test-tubes were cooled down under tap water stream. 2.5 mL of water, 400 \n\n\u00b5L of ammonium molybdate solution (1.25 % w/v) and 400 \u00b5L of fresh ascorbic acid solution (5 \n\n% w/v) were added to the test tube. After vortexing, test-tubes were kept at 100 \no\nC for 15 min. \n\nAfter cooling down under the tap water stream, absorption at 812 nm was measured with a \n\nspectrophotometer (Varian, Cary). Simultaneously with the analyzed samples, a standard curve \n\nwas prepared, using a phosphorus standard solution instead of lipids. \n\n4. SURFACE PRESSURE (?) \u2013 AREA (A) ISOTHERMS \n\nStandard isotherms were measured using NIMA 112 Langmuir-Blodgett trough equipped with \n\nmicro-balance. Before use, the trough was thoroughly cleaned with Kimptech paper tissues \n\nsequentially soaked in chloroform (C/4960/17 \u2013 Fisher Scientific, Leics, UK) and ethanol (32205 \n\n\u2013 Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), and dried in between with clean tissue, in three rounds. During \n\nthe cleaning procedure, powder free gloves were used. Subsequently, the trough was \n\nrepeatedly (three times) filled with pure water and the water-air interface was vacuum \n\ncleaned. A Wilhelmy plate made of ash-free filtration paper was attached to the microbalance \n\nand let to soak for 15 min. After reaching the equilibrium, barriers were closed with a speed of \n\n150 cm\n2\n/min and the surface pressure at the air/water interface was monitored. The system \n\nwas considered ready for use if the surface pressure through the whole closing process (from \n\n80 cm\n2\n to 25-30 cm\n\n2\n) would not vary more than 0.3 mN/m. Otherwise, the washing steps \n\nwould be repeated. \n\nIsotherms of lipid mixtures were measured from a starting zero surface pressure with a \n\ncompression rate of 5 cm\n2\n/min. The typical lipid concentration was 1 mg/mL. Each lipid \n\nmixture was measured at least twice, both on water and on buffer used later for the subphase. \n\n5. MICRO-CHAMBER FOR MONOLAYER STUDIES \n\nChamber spacers were cut from 2 mm thick sheet of PTFE by a laser cutter (Trotec Laser Inc., \n\nYpsilanti, MI, USA). Glass cover slips 24 x 24 mm\n2\n with 150 \u00b5m thickness (Gerhard Menzel \n\nGmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) were fixed to the spacer by glue. Prior to use, chambers were \n\nwashed interchangeably with ethanol and water, dried with stream of nitrogen and then \n\nplasma-cleaned for 10 min, so the glass surface acquires hydrophilic character. For protein \n\nassays, the chambers were further incubated with 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) \n\nsolution for 30 min in order to passivate the glass surface and prevent protein deposition. \n\nBuffer filled chambers (200 \u00b5L of SLB buffer \u2013 10 nM HEPES (05288.100 \u2013 BIOMOL GmbH, \n\nHamburg, Germany), 150mM NaCl (27810.295 \u2013 VWR International BVBA, Radnor, \n\nPennsylvania), pH 7.4) were incubated at 40 \no\nC for 5 min and lipid monolayers were deposited \n\nby drop-wise deposition of a chloroform solution of the desired lipid composition on the \n\nbuffer\u2013air interface (fig. 2.A-B). The typical lipid concentration was 0.1 mg/mL. After lipid \n\ndeposition, the sample was covered by a 22 x 22 mm\n2\n coverslip and allowed to cool down to \n\nroom temperature (? 23 \no\nC) at least for 5 min. A small volume was removed from the subphase \n\nto assure monolayer positioning in the range of the working distance of the objective (fig. 2.C-\n\nD), usually 300 \u2013 600 \u00b5m above the cover slip surface. Samples were imaged using a confocal \n\nlaser scanning microscope (LSM 510, ConfoCor2/3, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an LD \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n \n22 \n\nC-Apochromat (40x, 1.1 NA) objective with a working distance of 0.62 mm. The focus was \n\nplaced at the monolayer following laser scattering at the sample interfaces \u2013 the first intensity \n\npeak corresponds to the water glass-interface (the lower surface of the cover slip); the second \n\nto the scattering of the light at the glass-water interface (upper coverslip surface) and the \n\nupper reflection corresponds to the buffer-air interface. The right positioning was confirmed \n\nby monitoring the fluorescence intensity of the probe incorporated in the monolayer. All \n\nimage analysis was done using ImageJ 1.47i. \n\n \n\nFig. 2: Schematic overview of the sample preparation. A. Subphase addition (200 \u00b5L) to the chamber.

Adapted from (Chwastek &amp; \n\nSchwille, 2013). \n\n6. FCS MEASUREMENTS \n\nFCS measurements were performed using LSM 510 ConfoCor 2/3 microsocpe (Zeiss, Jena, \n\nGermany). Dichoric 288/543/633 mirror was used as a main beam splitter. Pinholes for APDs \n\n(Avalanche Photo Diodes) were set to 72 (for 488 nm laser line), 80 (for 543 nm laser line) and \n\n94 (for 633 nm laser line). Before each measurement the correction ring of the objective (LD C-\n\nApochromat 40x, 1.1 NA, 0.62 mm working distance) was adjusted to maximize the signal and \n\nthe system pinhole positions were automatically adjusted using GUI, with the focus placed at \n\nthe monolayer. \n\nFor single measurements, 5 second independent traces were averaged (typically 20). Focus \n\ncorrection was necessary over the measurements due to evaporation caused by increased \n\ntemperature and altered traces were removed from analysis. Data were fitted using Zeiss \n\nsoftware after discarding traces over which focus correction was done. Since monolayers are \n\nvery prone to mechanical instability and inherent undulations due to thermal fluctuations it \n\nwas necessary to fit a two-component two-dimensional diffusion model with a triplet state \n\n(eq. 13) in order to correct for the additional slow component appearing in the correlation \n\ncurve. Nevertheless, only data in which the slow component was smaller than 5 % were \n\nconsidered. The faster component was used to determine the diffusion time of the lipid dye. In \n\norder to calculate the lipid diffusion coefficient, the system was calibrated with Alexa 488 and \n\nAlexa 546 dyes which diffusion coefficient are known \u2013 435 \u00b5m\n2\n/s and 341 \u00b5m\n\n2\n/s respectively \n\n(Petrasek &amp; Schwille, 2008). In this case, correlation curves were fitted to one component \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n23 \n\nthree dimensional diffusion model with a triplet state (eq. 12) and the focal waist was \n\ncalculated according to equation 9. \n\n7. PROTEIN BINDING ASSAY \n\nThe protein solution (in SLB buffer) was applied by dipping the pipette tip through the \n\nmonolayer. After 1 min period of incubation the excess added volume was removed by dipping \n\nthe pipette tip. Protein FCS was measured at the interface as previously described (see FCS \n\nmeasurements) \n\nAs FCS data did not allow for proper correlation analysis due to fluctuations in the fluorescence \n\nsignal originating mainly from protein aggregation upon binding, another approach was used. \n\nCount rate obtained during FCS measurement was used as an estimation of the amount of the \n\nprotein bound to the monolayer and freely diffusing in the solution \u2013 eq. 14, where IF and I0 \n\nrepresent the intensity of emitted light and the light source respectively, k\u2019 is the logarithmic \n\nconversion of the geometrical/instrumental factor G, Q is the quantum yield, ? the molar \n\nabsorptivity, l the sample length and c its concentration. \n\n    \n                  (eq. 14) \n\nFor that, it was assumed that the fluorescence collected at the interface has an apparent \n\nintensity (Capp) as the measured signal has a complex nature. In an ideal case, the focal spot is \n\npositioned in such a way that the monolayer is exactly in the middle of the focal spot Veff (fig. \n\n3) so that the upper part is above the monolayer and the lower one is below the interface. \n\nThus, the collected Capp  is a sum of the signal from the monolayer itself (Cinter) and the signal \n\nfrom the lower part of the focal volume, which corresponds to half of the intensity collected in \n\nthe subphase (Csub). Therefore, \n\n            \n    \n\n \n? .         (eq. 15) \n\nFinally, to express protein binding to the monolayer, the ratio           ?  was used. \n\n \n\nFig. 3: Schematic representation of Veff positioning in relation to the monolayer (grey). A. When the focal \n\nspot is positioned at the interface, ideally the monolayer is oriented in a way that results in the \n\nsubmersion of a half of the Veff in the subphase. Capp is therefore a sum of Cinter and Csub/2. B. Positioning \n\nof the focus of the laser beam in the subphase allows the collection of signal coming only from the \n\nprotein in solution.

DISSOCIATION CONSTANT (KD) DETERMINATION \n\nTo determine the dissociation constant, the lipid monolayer was titrated with protein by \n\nadding successively increasing protein concentrations to the subphase. As previously, protein \n\nwas applied in 100 \u00b5L aliquots in SLB buffer and excess volume was removed after 1 min \n\nincubation. At each step, APD system was used to measure protein fluorescence intensity in \n\nthe subphase and at the interface. The measurement was terminated once the saturation \n\nplateau was reached. Collected data were plotted versus initial protein concentration, knowing \n\nthe concentration of used protein solution and assuming the subphase volume was constant \n\nover the duration of the experiment. Assuming protein fluorescence intensity proportional to \n\nprotein concentration, fitting the Hill equation to a plot of protein intensity at the surface \n\nagainst total protein concentration allows determination of protein KD (Shi et al, 2007). \n\nApplying it for monolayers, fluorescence intensity at the monolayer level (F) is a sigmoidal \n\nfunction of protein concentration (x) as described by equation 16, where Fmax is the maximum \n\nfluorescence intensity at the interface and n is the Hill coefficient, which describes \n\ncooperativity of the interaction. \n\n ( )      \n  \n\n  \n    \n\n          (eq. 16) \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n1. LIPID MIXTURE CHARACTERIZATION \n\n* 1.1. ?-A ISOTHERMS \n\nIn order to study the influence of lipid packing on lipid-protein interactions, a lipid monolayer \n\napproach was chosen. Due to the risk of lipid oxidation by carbon-chain exposure to air after \n\nlipid deposition in the air-water interface, fully saturated DMPC was used as a representative \n\nglycerophospholipid. Even though the Tm (? 23 \no\nC) (reviewed in Koynova &amp; Caffrey, 1998) is \n\nvery close to the room temperature (? 23.3 \no\nC), it is predicted that the DMPC monolayer \n\npresents as homogeneous fluid phase \u2013 liquid extended (LE). Only at high surface pressures \n\nnear the collapsing point of the monolayer, it should be possible to obtain a solid phase (S). \n\nThe surface pressure (?)-area (A) isotherms obtained either on water or on buffer (fig. 1) go in \n\nagreement with those described in literature (Sabatini et al, 2008; Wilke et al, 2010). The \n\nisotherm compression is accompanied by an increase in surface pressure till monolayer \n\ncollapses around 45 MMA (mean molecular area, in \u00c5\n2\n). The absence of a plateau or a sudden \n\nchange in the isotherm points towards a homogeneous LE phase in the whole range of \n\ncompression. Also, the used SLB buffer shows no apparent influence in the isotherm shape and \n\nlipid behavior. \n\n \n\nFig. 1: Representative ?-A isotherms of DMPC, DMPC:GM1 99:1 and DMPC:DOPE-Ncap-Biotin 95:5 on \n\nwater (A) and on SLB buffer (B) subphase. The arrows point possible phase transitions from LE to S for \n\nnon-pure DMPC monolayers and the * corresponds to the collapsing region of the monolayers.  \n\nBesides the characterization of pure DMPC monolayer, mixtures containing small percentage \n\nof GM1 and DOPE-Ncap-Biotin were analyzed in order to study the effect of specific ligand on \n\nprotein-monolayer interaction for choleratoxin and streptavidin, respectively. 5 mol % DOPE-\n\nNcap-Biotin and 1 mol % GM1 were used in order to ensure monolayer homogeneity (Rock et al, \n\n1991; Shi et al, 2007). The respective isotherms (fig. 1), both on water and on buffer, were \n\nslightly shifted to higher surface pressures. The effect of GM1, even though in smaller molar \n\npercentage, was superior to that of DOPE-Ncap-Biotin, especially on buffer, most probably due \n\nto its large area/volume occupied by the head group of this lipid (65 \u00c5\n2\n for GM1 compared to \n\n42.5 \u00c5\n2 \n\nfor DMPC). Even though, the critical area at which the collapse pressure is reached \n\ndidn\u2019t suffer any change with the presence of both GM1 and DOPE-Ncap-Biotin, as it would be \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n26 \n\nexpected from the small concentration in which they are present. Moreover, in accordance \n\nwith published data for other lipid mixtures containing GM1 (Yuan &amp; Johnston, 2000; Kycia et al, \n\n2011), the shape of the isotherm was not heavily modified, indicating a monolayer in LE phase \n\nup to ? 60 MMA. Around this value, for both mixtures a small kink in the isotherm was \n\nobserved which can be an evidence for a phase transition to the S state. Once again, the SLB \n\nbuffer did not show any major impact on shape of isotherms. \n\n* 1.2. STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION \n\nFor further characterization, monolayers at different MMA were imaged using to miniaturized \n\nchambers coupled with confocal microscopy (Chwastek &amp; Schwille, 2013). As a fluorescent \n\ndye, Chol 542 was added to DMPC, DMPC:GM1 99:1 and DMPC:DOPE-Ncap-biotin 95:5 lipid \n\nmixtures at concentration which assure monolayer visualization and do not interfere with the \n\nmonolayer organization. In accordance with previous studies, a Chol 542 concentration of 0.05 \n\nmol % was used with no influence on the monolayer isotherm, as observed in control \n\nmeasurements (not shown). Lipid monolayer imaging (fig. 2) revealed that in the range of \n\nanalyzed MMA (50 to 100 \u00c5\n2\n), the three analyzed mixture have a mostly homogeneous \n\ndeposition at the air-water interface. However both at low (100 MMA) and high (60 \u2013 50 \n\nMMA) pressures the monolayer shows slight variations. At 100 MMA, some rapidly diffusing \n\ngas domains (G) are still formed due to the small amount of lipids deposited at the interface \n\nand low surface tension resulted from loose molecular packing. On the other hand, with the \n\nincrease in surface pressure, dye clusters tend to form. Moreover, some small non-defined \n\ndomains can be found at 50 MMA. The presence of fast-diffusing domains due to air flow, \n\nsample tilt and microscope/table vibration may hamper APD usage for further studies as the \n\nstability of the signal is compromised. Nonetheless, whether pure DMPC or its mixtures with \n\nGM1 or DOPE-Ncap-Biotin, monolayers have a general homogeneous appearance, irrespectively \n\nfrom the type of subphase. Thus this system fulfills requirements for being used in FCS studies. \n\n* 1.3. DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT DETERMINATION \n\nIn order to confirm the stability and reproducibility of the system, FCS studies were performed \n\non DMPC monolayers deposited at different ? in a buffer-air interface, as previous studies \n\nshowed a very small influence of SLB buffer on lipid diffusion (Chwastek &amp; Schwille, 2013). To \n\navoid APD saturation, a concentration of around 0.01 mol % Chol 542 was used. From the time \n\ncorrelation of the signal and its fitting to a 2D 2 component model (eq. 13), which accounts not \n\nonly for the two dimensional diffusion of the dye, but also for the monolayer vibration and the \n\nfraction of particles that transit for the triplet state, lipid diffusion can be determined through \n\nequation 9. For that, a previous system calibration is needed \u2013 several dilutions of Alexa 546 (D \n\n= 341 \u00b5m\n2\n/s (Petrasek &amp; Schwille, 2008)) were used to determine r0\n\n2\n through correlation curve \n\nfitting to a 3D model (eq. 12). \n\nPrevious studies have shown that an increased lipid density slows lipid mobility (Gudmand et \n\nal, 2009). This is also observed in the current system (Chwastek &amp; Schwille, 2013), shifting the \n\ncorrelation curves towards slower diffusion times (fig. 3.A). Analyzing the corresponding \n\ndiffusion coefficients as a function of MMA, a linear tendency is obtained as expected from the  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n27 \n\n 100 MMA 80 MMA 50 MMA \n\nD\nM\n\nP\nC\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nD\nM\n\nP\nC\n\n:G\nM\n\n1\n \n\n9\n9\n\n:1\n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\nD\nM\n\nP\nC\n\n:D\nO\n\nP\nE\n\n-N\nc\na\n\np\n-B\n\nio\nti\n\nn\n \n\n9\n5\n\n:5\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2: Representative confocal microscopy images of different DMPC monolayers (pure, 1 mol % GM1 \n\nand 5 mol % DOPE-Ncap-Biotin) at 100, 80 and 50 MMA, labeled with 0.05 mol % Chol 542.

The intersection of the obtained linear fit with \n\nthe horizontal axis corresponds to the theoretical MMA at which the lipid diffusion coefficient \n\nequals zero \u2013 critical point (ac). In the above experiment, ac was 36.0 \u00b1 4.7 \u00c5\n2\n/molecule which \n\ndeviates slightly from previously reported values for the same lipid (42.5 \u00b1 7.5 \u00c5\n2\n (Chwastek &amp; \n\nSchwille, 2013) / ? 47 \u00c5\n2\n (Gudmand et al, 2009)) most probably due to the error associated \n\nwith the extreme points of the fit \u2013 100 MMA when the presence of small gas phases can \n\ninfluence the measurements and at 50 MMA when the high pressure and formation of S phase \n\nmay influence lipid deposition.

DYE DISTRIBUTION \n\nWith the increase of lipid density at lower MMA, it is expected that the number of particles N \n\nin the focal volume Veff increases. Nonetheless, that was not observed in the performed \n\nexperiments (fig. 4) \u2013 not only the distribution of the lipid dye was not increasing \n\nproportionally to ?, but also the fluorophore showed a non-homogeneous distribution within \n\nthe monolayer. \n\nIn order to address the problem of abnormal dye distribution it was first investigated whether \n\nthe effect is was due to the dye sterol nature the Chol 542 label was substituted by an \n\nequivalent concentration of DiO \u2013 a lipophilic carbocyanine. On the other hand, given the \n\nDMPC Tm temperature in the range of the room temperature and the possibility of small \n\ntemperature gradients within the monolayer caused by the laser heating, N variation with \n\nMMA in monolayers formed of phospholipids with lower Tm was also studied. Therefore pure \n\nDOPC, an unsaturated phospholipid with Tm = \u2013 18 \no\nC (reviewed in Koynova &amp; Caffrey, 1998), \n\nlabeled with 0.01 mol % Chol 542 was used in order to eliminate the influence of temperature. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4: Variation of number of particles of Chol 542 N in a DMPC monolayer deposited at different lipid \n\ndensities on a SLB buffer subphase.

The critical point is 37.2 \u00b1 13.5 \n\n\u00c5\n2\n/molecule for DMPC (in agreement with the previous results) and 32.7 \u00b1 12.7 \u00c5\n\n2\n/molecule \n\nfor DOPC. Having in mind its molecular area (72.2 \u00c5\n2 \n\nobtained in SLBs at 30 \no\nC (Tristram-Nagle \n\net al, 1998)), the obtained ac value for DOPC is deviated from the expected, most probably due \n\nto errors at the extremes of lipid density in study (70 and 120 MMA). Note that the \n\nexperiments presented here were performed at a lower temperature (23 \no\nC) which should \n\ncontribute for a lower ac as the thermal motion of the free rotating bonds is reduced. \n\nNevertheless, the diffusion coefficient variation with lipid packing seems to be in good \n\nagreement with the predicted by FAM. Nevertheless, as for DMPC labeled with Chol 542, the \n\nnumber of fluorophore particles in the monolayer does not vary linearly with increased lipid \n\ndensity. So, neither fluorescent probe nor phospholipid nature seems to influence the \n\ndetected number of particles. The study of probe partition in different lipid monolayers at \n\nincreasing surface pressures could probably give a hint about the reason for its abnormal \n\ndistribution within the monolayer. \n\nNevertheless, the system appears to be quite reproducible regarding lipid monolayer \n\ndeposition, packing and mobility. Thus, it is possible to proceed to further studies, namely \n\nprotein binding assays. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n30 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5: Diffusion coefficients D as a function of MMA and corresponding linear fit (dashed line) of (A) \n\nDMPC labeled with 0.01 mol % DiO and of (B) DOPC labeled with 0.01 mol % Chol 542.

INFLUENCE OF LIPID PACKING IN HOMOGENEOUS MONOLAYERS \n\nIn order to study protein-monolayer interaction, an APD system was used to measure \n\nstreptavidin-Alexa488 fluorescence intensity at the SLB buffer subphase and at the interface \n\n(fig. 6). DMPC lipid monolayers were deposited at the buffer-air interface with different lipid \n\ndensities. After confirming the integrity of the monolayer (as described in Results and \n\ndiscussion; 1.1. to 1.3.), 100 \u00b5L protein solution was added to the subphase in order to reach \n\nan initial concentration of 100 nM, as it is expected that streptavidin doesn\u2019t bind strongly to \n\nthe lipid interface. Each sample was measured after 1 min incubation and removal of excess \n\nvolume. \n\nFluorescence intensity of streptavidin is much higher at the monolayer interface than in the \n\nsubphase, which is in accordance with the difference in count rate per molecule of Alexa 488 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n31 \n\nin presence and absence of lipids, as described in literature for a variety of fluorescent probes \n\n(reviewed in Valeur, 2002; Lakowicz, 2006). Due to the difference in polarity of surrounding \n\nmedium, the non-radiative processes are increased in the buffer subphase which contributes \n\nto the reduction of the probe\u2019s quantum yield. Moreover, at a constant protein concentration, \n\nthe fluorescence intensity at the interface increases with increasing MMA, while it remains \n\nconstant in the subphase (excluding 50 MMA) which points towards the dependence of \n\nprotein binding on lipid packing. A quantification of the ratio between the interface and \n\nsubphase fluorescence intensities indicates that streptavidin binding to DMPC monolayer \n\nmight be dependent on lipid packing (fig. 7.A) and therefore also on the lipid diffusion (fig. \n\n7.B), being higher at a loose packing. Interestingly, this tendency had already been proposed \n\nfour decades ago based on surface pressure variation studies induced by protein addition to \n\nPC monolayers at different physical states (Phillips et al, 1975) and glycosphingolipid \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 6: Fluorescence intensity of streptavidin-Alexa 488 (100 nM) in the subphase (A) and interface (B) of \n\na DMPC monolayer system deposited at the SLB buffer-air interface. \n\n \n\nFig. 7: Streptavidin-Alexa 488 (100 nM) binding (Ci/Cs) to DMPC monolayers as a function of MMA (A) \n\nand D (B). \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n32 \n\nmonolayers at different ? (Fidelio et al, 1981). However, at lower lipid density (100 MMA), \n\nwhere the lipids are loosely packed and formation of G phases is possible (fig. 2), streptavidin \n\nbinding reduces again. Moreover, in a pure buffer-air interface streptavidin binding is relatively \n\nlow (Ci/Cs = 14.0 \u00b1 8.1), which suggests that the protein is not surface active and requires lipid \n\nfor proper binding to the interface. Thus the data suggest that streptavidin establishes weak \n\ninteractions with lipid molecules but further studies are needed to characterize the precise \n\nnature (hydrophobic or electrostatic) of the this interaction. This can be analyzed by varying \n\nthe buffer conditions (pH, ion concentration and composition) as well as the chain length and \n\nsaturation of monolayer phospholipids. \n\n* 2.2. INFLUENCE OF PHASE SEPARATION \n\nIn order to illustrate the dependence of the protein-monolayer interaction on lipid packing, \n\nprotein behavior in presence of different phase separated lipid monolayers was studied. The \n\nreason for this is that the liquid condensed (LC)/ S phase lipid molecules are more tightly \n\npacked then in the LE phase. After obtaining the ?-A isotherms of DMPC:DSPC 1:1, DPPC, \n\nDOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 and DPPC:Chol 7:3 lipid mixtures (fig. 8), lipid monolayers were \n\ndeposited at a similar surface pressure (7-12 mN/m) in order to obtain phase separation. This \n\nsurface pressure is in the range of the isotherm plateau observed for pure DPPC \u2013 at this \n\nconstant ?, phase coexistence is possible by gradual transition of lipid molecules from LE to LC \n\nsolid-like phase, resulting in a decrease in MMA (Phillips &amp; Chapman, 1968). In the other \n\nmixtures, no plateau is observed as the lipids organize spontaneously in two phases (LE and LC \n\nin case of DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 and DPPC:Chol 7:3; LE and S in case of DMPC:DSPC 1:1) due to \n\ntheir physico-chemical nature (Kim et al, 2001; Yun et al, 2003; Sabatini et al, 2008; Wilke et al, \n\n2010). All mixtures were labeled with 0.05 mol % Chol 542 \u2013 previous studies had shown that \n\nin monolayers, as in bilayers, the probe preferentially partitions into the LE phase in \n\ncomparison to S or LC (corresponding to ld, gel and lo phases respectively in bilayers) \n\n(Chwastek &amp; Schwille, 2013). An initial concentration of around 50-100 nM streptavidin was \n\nadded and samples were imaged through confocal microscopy (fig. 9). \n\n \n\nFig. 8: ?-A isotherm of DMPC:DSPC 1:1, DPPC, DOPC:bDM:Chol 1:1:1 and DPPC:Chol 7:3 lipid mixtures. \n\nAll monolayers showed a phase separation, with dark S/LC domains in a bright homogeneous \n\nLE background (fig. 9). The poor contrast in case of DMPC:DSPC 1:1 is probably due to the high \n\nS phase content of the sample even though it was expected to occupy 25 % of the area (Wilke  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n33 \n\nA C \n\n  \n\n  \nB D \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFig. 9: Representative images of streptavidin-Alexa 488 (50-100nM) binding to DMPC:DSPC 1:1 (A), DPPC \n\n(B), DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 (C) and DPPC:Chol 7:3 (D) phase separated monolayers labeled with Chol 542 \n\n0.05 mol %. Images of the lipid monolayer before protein addition are also shown \u2013 representative \n\nphases are marked. \n\net al, 2010). According to the observed dependence of protein binding on lipid packing (fig. 7), \n\na higher protein fluorescence intensity was expected in LE phase in comparison to the LC/S \n\nphase in phase separated mixtures. In contrast, in DMPC:DSPC 1:1, DPPC and DOPC:bSM:Chol \n\n1:1:1 monolayers streptavidin tends to accumulate at domain boarders, the interface of the \n\nfluid and solid phases. Moreover, no significant difference in fluorescence intensity of protein \n\nwas observed between the phases. Only DPPC:Chol 7:3 monolayer streptavidin shows a \n\nbehavior coherent with the binding curves (fig. 7) \u2013 there is a preference in binding to the LE \n\nphase compared to LC phase. This results might be explained by the difference in lipid packing \n\nbetween LC/S and LE phase \u2013 in DMPC:DSPC 1:1 the phase separation is extreme, between a \n\nhighly packed S phase and a fluid LE phase; pure DPPC phase separates in LE and LC gel-like \n\nphases; DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 and DPPC:Chol 1:1 are both raft-like phase separations. \n\nNonetheless, DPPC:Chol 1:1 presents a lower difference in lipid packing between phases when \n\ncompared to DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1, according to previous studies in phase separated GUVs \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n34 \n\nlabeled with Laurdan dyes (Bagatolli &amp; Gratton, 2000; Sezgin unpublished results on giant \n\nplasma membrane vesicles). Moreover, other molecules \u2013 such as fatty acids and various \n\npeptides \u2013 tend to accumulate in the grain boundaries of domains with high lipid order (line \n\ndefects with increased hydration) or are distributed in the interface of phases with high lipid \n\npacking difference (Nuscher et al, 2004; Franquelim et al, 2010; Yarrow &amp; Kuipers, 2011; \n\nKhmelinskaia et al, 2013). Thus, it is not surprising to see a similar effect in streptavidin binding \n\nto phase separated monolayers. In summary, the results imply an important role of phase \n\nseparation in controlling protein binding and its sorting at the membrane. \n\n* 2.3. INFLUENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF A BIOTINYLATED LIPID \n\nProceeding further, the studies aimed at exploiting the strong binding of streptavidin to biotin \n\nby incorporating a biotinylated lipid \u2013 DOPE-Ncap-Biotin \u2013 into the monolayer. Thus, binding \n\ncurve of streptavidin to DMPC:DOPE-Ncap-Biotin 95:5 monolayers were obtained (fig. 10). \n\n \n\nFig. 10: Streptavidin-Alexa 488 (100 nM) binding (Ci/Cs) to DMPC, DMPC:DPPE-Ncap-Biotin 95:5, \n\nDMPC:DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin 99:1 monolayers as a function of MMA (A) and pressure (B). Pressure \n\nvalues are averaged from the respective ?-A isotherms (fig. 1 and 13). \n\nInterestingly, the presence of DPPE-Ncap-Biotin instead of increasing streptavidin \n\nconcentration at the interface, reduced this interaction. Although this biotinylated lipid is \n\nwidely used for specific binding assays, usually an altered form of streptavidin/avidin is used \n\nthat abolishes unspecific binding (e.g. Sarmento et al, 2012; Vogel &amp; Schwille, 2012; \n\nHeinemann et al, 2013). Additional evidences of strongly suppressed streptavidin binding to \n\nDPPE-Ncap-Biotin due to steric hindrance or inaccessibility of biotin for the binding spot from \n\nthe actin-myosin minimal system (Vogel &amp; Schwille, 2012), might partially explain the obtained \n\nresult. Note that for biotin binding to neighboring subunits in streptavidin, a fixed distance of \n\n20 \u00c5 should be retained as otherwise the binding will be sterically hindered (Hendrickson et al, \n\n1989). It is also possible that the addition of DPPE-Ncap-biotin to the monolayer increases the \n\nsurface pressure in a way that prevents streptavidin binding. Nevertheless, ?-A isotherm (fig. \n\n1) previously showed that the increase in surface pressure is not significant and thus this \n\npossibility is overruled (fig. 10.B). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n35 \n\nIn Vogel and Schwille 2012, this problem was overcome by using DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin. Thus \n\nthis molecule appeared as a valid alternative for a specific membrane ligand for streptavidin. \n\nHowever, the protein binding curve obtained for DMPC:DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin 99:1 monolayer \n\nat different lipid densities showed the same trend observed with DPPE-Ncap-Biotin \u2013 \n\nstreptavidin binds very poorly to the monolayer at all analyzed lipid densities and even lower \n\nthan in absence of a biotinylated lipid (fig. 10). One possible reason could be the inaccessibility \n\nof biotin to streptavidin binding due to PEG2000 tail conformation in the monolayer. \n\nMoreover, in lipid monolayers long-chained PEG molecules present three conformations (fig. \n\n11) \u2013 at high MMA PEG molecules assume a pancake conformation in which the PEG tails are \n\nextended along the water-air interface; when the lipid density increases, PEG tails assume \n\nglobular mushroom conformation; at high surface pressures, PEG chains extend towards the \n\nsubphase in a brush conformation (Baekmark et al, 1995). \n\n \n\nFig. 11: Schematic representation of the three possible conformations for long-chained PEG-ylated lipid \n\n\u2013 pancakes (A), mushroom (B) and brush (C) conformation. Adapted from (Baekmark et al, 1995). \n\nMoreover, in the mushroom conformation, DSPE-PEG2000 has a molecular area two orders of \n\nmagnitude higher (3719 \u00c5\n2\n (Allen et al, 2002)) than that of regular phospholipids (40-70 \u00c5\n\n2\n). \n\nThus, surface coverage by PEG chains plays an important role in protein interactions with lipid \n\nlayers (Kim et al, 2000; Auguste et al, 2008). \n\nTaking into account the head area of DSPE-PEG2000 and the number of molecules of \n\nPEGylated lipids present in the monolayer at different lipid densities, it was possible to \n\ncalculate the surface coverage by PEG tails in mixtures containing different concentrations of \n\nDSPE-PEG2000-Biotin (fig. 12), as done for other systems (Allen et al, 2002). At low DSPE-\n\nPEG2000 concentrations (0.1 mol %), the surface coverage is almost independent of the lipid \n\ndensity and it never excesses 10 %. When the concentration increases to 1 mol % the surface \n\ncoverage increases strongly with MMA decrease from 40 to 80 %. At 5 mol %, PEG side chains \n\ncompletely cover the surface at all MMA. \n\nFurthermore, literature suggests that due to the high molecular area and the possibility of \n\nthree chain conformations, the presence of long-chain PEGylated lipids will modify monolayer \n\nproperties (Tanwir &amp; Tsoukanova, 2008; Tsoukanova &amp; Salesse, 2008). Thus, the obtained ?-A \n\nisotherm for DMPC:DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin (fig. 13) not only is strongly shifted towards higher \n\nMMA in comparison to pure DMPC but also presents two main discontinuities \u2013 a pseudo \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n36 \n\nplateau around 11 mN/m corresponding to the mushroom to pancake transition and a second \n\none due to DMPC transition from LE to S and consequent monolayer collapse, as described for \n\nother lipid mixtures containing the DSPE-PEG2000 (Tanwir &amp; Tsoukanova, 2008). \n\n \n\nFig. 12: Surface coverage (%) by PEG chains in DMPC mixtures containing 0.1 ( ), 1 ( ) and 5 mol % ( ) \n\nDSPE-PEG2000-Biotin. \n\n \n\nFig. 13: ?-A isotherm of DMPC:DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin 99:1 lipid mixtures. Pure DMPC isotherm is also \n\nrepresented for a better comparison \u2013 dashed line. \n\nMoreover, monolayer imaging revealed the presence of undefined dark PEG-rich domains in \n\nthe entire range of MMA studied, in accordance to previous studies (Tanwir &amp; Tsoukanova, \n\n2008), even at concentrations as low as 0.2 mol % DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin and at low lipid \n\ndensities (fig. 14). Additionally, lipid dye appears to cluster in presence of larger domains, \n\ncontributing to a non-homogeneous signal. Thus, the conformational transitions of the long \n\nPEG chains might explain the shielding of streptavidin binding to DMPC monolayers containing \n\nDSPE-PEG2000-Biotin (fig. 10). \n\nSince in literature, the conformational transitions and domain formation and their effect on \n\nmodel membranes are mainly described for PEG molecules with long chains (Rex et al, 1998; \n\nGeorgiev et al, 2007; Tsoukanova &amp; Salesse, 2008; Stepniewski et al, 2011), DMPC mixture \n\ncontaining 0.1 mol % DOPE-PEG350 was morphologically characterized by confocal microscopy \n\n(fig. 15). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n37 \n\n \n\nFig. 14: Representative images of DMPC monolayers (100 MMA) containing 0.2 mol % DSPE-PEG2000-\n\nBiotin. The black domains correspond to PEG-rich domains. \n\n \n\nFig. 15: Representative images of DMPC monolayers (100 MMA) containing 0.1 mol % DOPE-PEG350. \n\nThe black domains correspond to PEG-rich domains. \n\nDespite the much shorter PEG chains and lower molecular area (468 \u00c5\n2\n/molecule for DSPE-\n\nPEG350 (Allen et al, 2002)) of the functionalized lipids and thus a lower surface coverage, the \n\nDMPC monolayers didn\u2019t present a homogeneous morphology \u2013 several irregular domains \n\nwere observed, which point towards a similar behavior to that observed with DSPE-PEG2000-\n\nBiotin. \n\nA further possibility to obtain the specific streptavidin \u2013 biotin binding would be substituting \n\nnative streptavidin for ExtrAvidin or NeutrAvidin \u2013 mutant (strept)avidin forms which retain \n\nthe high protein stability and binding avidity but reduces the unspecific binding. Both protein \n\nforms were successfully used in assays involving correspondingly DPPE-Ncap-Biotin and DSPE-\n\nPEG2000-Biotin incorporation in lipid bilayers (Sarmento et al, 2012; Vogel &amp; Schwille, 2012; \n\nHeinemann et al, 2013). \n\n3. CHOLERA TOXIN ? BINDING TO LIPID MONOLAYER \n\n* 3.1. INFLUENCE OF LIPID PACKING ON CTXB5 BINDING TO MONOLAYERS WITH \n\nDIFFERENT GM1 CONTENT \n\nBesides streptavidin, Ctx binding to lipid monolayers was studied as this protein has a natural \n\nligand \u2013 the ganglioside GM1 \u2013 that incorporates in lipid layers. Due to its lack of toxicity and \n\nretained GM1 binding activity, the pentameric CtxB5 ring was used. Fluorescence intensity \n\nmeasurements of CtxB5-Alexa 488 in the subphase and at interface was used to assess the \n\ninfluence of not only lipid packing, but also GM1 and protein concentrations on CtxB5 binding to \n\nthe monolayer. The MMA was varied under three conditions (fig. 16): pure DMPC monolayer \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n38 \n\nincubated with 100 nM and also 5 nM protein and DMPC monolayer containing 0.1 mol % GM1 \n\nincubated with 5 nM protein. The GM1 content was reduced from 1 mol % (fig.1) to 0.1 mol % \n\nin order to avoid any possible influence on the monolayer morphology, taking into account the \n\nexperience previously had with lipid mixtures containing a biotinylated lipid. Control ?-A \n\nisotherm (not shown) didn\u2019t show any major alterations in comparison to pure DMPC, as \n\npreviously shown for the mixture containing higher GM1 concentration (fig. 1). \n\n \n\nFig. 16: Fluorescence intensity of Cholera toxin ?-Alexa 488 in the subphase (A) and interface (B) of \n\nDMPC monolayer system with different GM1 content deposited at the SLB buffer-air interface \u2013 pure \n\nDMPC incubated with 5 nM and 100 nM CtxB5; DMPC containing 0.1 mol % GM1 incubated with 5nM \n\nCtxB5. \n\nAs previously observed for streptavidin (fig. 6), CtxB5 fluorescence intensity at the monolayer \n\ninterface is dependent on the lipid packing, especially at the high protein concentration (100 \n\nnM), while in the subphase it remains mainly constant, pointing towards a plausible \n\ndependence of protein binding on monolayer MMA. Also, the intensity of the protein at the \n\nmonolayer level is generally higher than in the subphase, as expected from the change in Alexa \n\n488 quantum yield according to polarity of surrounding medium. However, the difference in \n\nCtxB5 intensities between subphase and interface appears to be much lower than the one \n\nobserved for streptavidin at the same concentration (note the higher fluorescence intensity in \n\nthe subphase of CtxB5 (? 10 a.u.) compared to that of streptavidin (? 1 a.u.) \u2013 fig. 16.A and 6.A \n\nrespectively). This implies a lower membrane binding of Ctx compared to streptavidin. As \n\nfluorescence intensity is proportional to fluorophore concentration (eq. 14), an increase of \n\nfluorescence intensity in both subphase and monolayer interface at higher protein \n\nconcentrations is observed. For further analysis, protein binding was quantified through ratio \n\nof interface and subphase intensities (see Materials and Methods; 7) (fig. 17). \n\nThe previously observed streptavidin binding dependence on monolayer lipid packing (fig. 7.A) \n\nis manifested only at high protein concentrations in case of CtxB5. At a starting protein \n\nconcentration of 100 nM, CtxB5 binding increases with lipid MMA in pure DMPC monolayers, \n\nsuggesting that protein binding is dependent on surface pressure which is in accordance with \n\nprevious studies (Fidelio et al, 1981). On the other hand, at a concentration as low as 5 nM, \n\nprotein concentration appears to be rather independent of lipid packing. Thus, the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n39 \n\nconcentration of protein reservoir influences CtxB5 binding to lipid monolayer, as had been \n\nproposed four decades ago in Ctx, melittin and myelin penetration in ganglioside monolayers \n\n(Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982). Further, when comparing streptavidin binding to pure \n\nbuffer-air interface (Ci/Cs = 14.0 \u00b1 8.1) to that of CtxB5 (Ci/Cs = 150.8 \u00b1 32.8) at the same initial \n\nprotein concentration (100 nM), the latter protein reveals rather higher surface activity. \n\nNevertheless, the overall binding of streptavidin to the monolayer (Ci/Cs > 10 \u2013 fig. 7) is higher \n\nthan that one of CtxB5 (Ci/Cs &lt;= 10 \u2013 fig. 17). This distinct protein behavior must be related to \n\nprotein structure as the interaction with the interface emerges from the establishment of \n\nseveral weak interactions of its components with protein amino-acid residues. So, additional \n\nbinding assays in different buffer conditions are needed in order to understand the nature of \n\nthe protein-monolayer interaction. \n\n \n\nFig. 17: CtxB5-Alexa 488 binding (Ci/Cs) to DMPC monolayers with different GM1 content as a function of \n\nMMA \u2013 pure DMPC incubated with 5 nM and 100 nM CtxB5; DMPC containing 0.1 mol % GM1 incubated \n\nwith 5nM CtxB5. \n\nWhen analyzing the influence of GM1 presence in the monolayer, an increase of CtxB5 binding \n\nto the monolayer is expected due to the specificity of the ligand-protein binding. Accordingly, a \n\nslight increase of CtxB5 binding is observed when a small concentration (0.1 mol %) of \n\nganglioside is incorporated. Interestingly, the observed trend relative to lipid density at low \n\nprotein concentration is the same in absence or presence of GM1 \u2013 the protein binding is \n\nmainly constant through the studied lipid densities. This suggests that even at high pressures \n\nGM1 is homogeneously distributed in the monolayer in a way which allows CtxB5 binding. \n\nNevertheless, at 50 MMA CtxB5 binding to monolayer is not influenced by GM1 presence, \n\nprobably due to increased ganglioside density that hinders protein-ligand interaction (Shi et al, \n\n2007). \n\nAt 100 MMA, both protein and GM1 concentration effects are canceled \u2013 note the big error \n\nbars associated with the measurements. This might be explained by the possible formation of \n\ngas phases and variation of protein binding to zones of different lipid packing due to meniscus \n\nformed by subphase deposition or sample tilting. The increase in surface pressure associated \n\nwith lipid deposition at the interface reduces the meniscus angle, thus reducing the variation \n\nin lipid density. \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n40 \n\n* 3.2. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN BINDING \n\nFor a better comparison of the influences of lipid packing and GM1 content on CtxB5 binding to \n\nDMPC monolayers, lipid monolayer was titrated with increasing CtxB5 concentration in order \n\nto obtain KD values by fitting the Hill equation to the titration curve (eq. 16). At each \n\nconcentration, protein fluorescence intensity was measured through APD system in the \n\nsubphase and at the monolayer level. Four different conditions were studied: pure DMPC and \n\n0.1 mol % GM1 containing DMPC monolayers, both at 50 and 90 MMA. Since the Alexa 488 \n\nsignal was observed to have a high reflection component, due to the imperfect cut-off of the \n\nexcitation wavelength by the available filter system, CtxB5-Alexa 647 was used as the \n\nwavelength cut-off is much better aligned allowing a more accurate data acquisition. \n\nThe subphase CtxB5 concentrations shows mostly linear dependency with increasing initial \n\nconcentration at all conditions, not presenting major dependence either on GM1 content or \n\nlipid density (fig. 18.A). On the other hand, at the interface CtxB5 appears to have a tendency \n\nto saturate the monolayer as at high protein concentration (above 70 nM) it becomes difficult \n\nto increase the membrane binding (fig. 18.B). A similar saturation was described on ganglioside \n\nmonolayers and GM1 containing POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) SLBs \n\n(Cumar et al, 1982; Shi et al, 2007). Nonetheless, the values at which the protein saturates the \n\nsurface are widely spread, not only due to difference in method accuracy but also in the \n\nprotein pool available to bind the surface \u2013 note that the ratio of surface area and reservoir \n\nvolume does influence the protein binding, as the same total amount of protein when \n\navailable for a bigger area will appear as lower concentration of the protein on the membrane. \n\nAt low protein concentrations, no difference between conditions is observed, as it is predicted \n\nfrom the CtxB5 binding curve (fig. 17). However, with increasing protein concentration the \n\nfluorescence intensity at 90 MMA reaches higher values than at 50 MMA, suggesting a \n\npreferential CtxB5 binding to less packed monolayers. Additionally, these results uncover the \n\ninfluence of GM1 on CtxB5 binding to lipid monolayers that were not clear in the previous \n\nbinding curve (fig. 17) \u2013 in presence of 0.1 mol % of ganglioside, the fluorescence intensity \n\nincreases globally as the amount of protein binding to the monolayer increases. Also, subphase \n\nconcentration is in general never higher than that of the interface, in accordance with the \n\nhigher fluorophore quantum yield when inserted in a non-polar environment. It\u2019s predicted \n\nthat this behavior is overcome once the saturation plateau is established and the protein \n\naccumulates in the subphase reaching much higher concentrations \u2013 note that at high protein \n\nconcentration (90-130 MMA) in absence of GM1, the protein fluorescence intensity in subphase \n\nand at interface is comparable. \n\nThe predicted sigmoidal behavior of CtxB5 binding to the lipid monolayer by Hill equation (Shi \n\net al, 2007) it\u2019s not easily observed in the case of this study. This might be caused by high \n\nstandard deviation associated with measurements (fig. 19) \u2013 not only is the protein \n\ndistribution in the monolayer during a single titration not homogeneous, but also there is a \n\nhigh degree of variability associated with independent samples. Various factors could \n\ncontribute in the inhomogeneity of APD signal within a sample \u2013 firstly, protein clusters may \n\nform when it interacts with the lipid interface; secondly, the presence of meniscus in the lipid \n\nmonolayer or other variations in the lipid packing which appear during lipid solution deposition  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n41 \n\n \n\nFig. 18: Representative trends of subphase (A) and interface (B) CtxB5-Alexa 647 fluorescence intensity \n\nin DMPC monolayers with different GM1 content (0 and 0.1 mol %) at 50 and 90 MMA.

Trends of \n\nindependent measurements of CtxB5-Alexa 647 binding to DMPC monolayer containing 0.1 mol % GM1 at \n\n90 MMA. \n\nat the interface could also alter protein binding to the monolayer. Furthermore, there are \n\nseveral factors that are still not fully controlled and thus vary between independent samples \n\nsuch as subphase evaporation, lipid oxidation or protein deposition at the glass cover slip. \n\nThus, the data do not allow relevant fit and no reproducible trends or quantitative conclusions \n\nabout protein binding can be obtained (fig. 19). Some of these concerned could be addressed \n\nby using a ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavenger in order to reduce lipid oxidation or by \n\nmodifying chamber structure and treatment for a better control of subphase evaporation and \n\nprotein deposition. \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n42 \n\n* 3.3. PROTEIN BINDING TO PHASE SEPARATED MONOLAYERS WITH DIFFERENT GM1 \n\nCONTENT \n\nBased on CtxB5 binding trend with lipid packing on homogeneous DMPC monolayers and \n\ndifferential GM1 partitioning suggested by literature (see below), a comparative study of its \n\nbehavior in phase separated DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 monolayers with different GM1 content \u20130, \n\n0.1 and 1 mol % was conducted (fig. 20). Lipid monolayers were imaged through confocal \n\nmicroscopy at each step of protein titration (till a maximum concentration of 130 nM) and, in \n\norder to proceed to a semi-quantitative analysis, fluorescence intensity profiles of \n\nrepresentative cross-sections were taken (fig. 20). \n\nFurther image analysis allowed to assess mean CtxB5 fluorescence intensity separately in LE \n\nand LC phase and to quantify the relative binding of the protein in these phases (fig. 21). \n\nIn absence of GM1, CtxB5 binds preferentially to the LE phase (fig. 21.A) as expected from earlier \n\nstudies (Chwastek &amp; Schwille, 2013) and previously presented results (fig. 17). Moreover, \n\nprotein partitioning is dependent on the initial protein concentration \u2013 the ratio of \n\nfluorescence intensities between LE and LC phase increases with the concentration (fig. 21.C) \n\nas lipid binding curves suggest (fig. 17). Note that this behavior is apparently not reverted even \n\nat high protein concentration. When a small concentration of GM1 (0.1 mol %) is incorporated \n\nin the monolayer, there is no significant difference between CtxB5 binding to LE or LC phase. \n\nNonetheless, at low protein concentration (bellow 30 nM), CtxB5 is enriched in LC phase as \n\ncompared to LE phase (fig. 21.B and C) as expected from closely related work (Chwastek &amp; \n\nSchwille, 2013), due to preferential incorporation of GM1 in ordered domains (Rock et al, 1991; \n\nVi\u00e9 et al, 1998; Yuan &amp; Johnston, 2000; Menke et al, 2002). As the available GM1 for binding is \n\neasily saturated, this tendency is reversed and LE phase show an increased CtxB5 binding when \n\ncompared to LC phase at total protein concentrations higher than 30 nM. On the other hand, \n\nwhen GM1 concentration in the monolayer is increased to 1 mol % the CtxB5 enrichment in LC \n\nphase as compared to LE phase is stabilized (fig.20) as GM1 saturation is not reached in the \n\nrange of analyzed protein concentrations (1 \u2013 130 nM). Moreover, this trend is even more \n\nobvious as the initial protein concentration increases \u2013at higher protein concentrations the \n\nlaser power used during the imaging (generally kept at 5 %) was reduced to avoid channel \n\nsaturation (0.2 %). \n\nThus, these results suggest that phase separation might be a mechanism of controlling protein-\n\nmembrane interactions through differences in protein packing, as had already been shown in \n\nstreptavidin experiments (fig. 9). Additionally, the roles of protein concentration (Phillips et al, \n\n1975; Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982) and membrane GM1 content (Shi et al, 2007) in \n\nCtxB binding are also confirmed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n43 \n\nD\nO\n\nP\nC\n\n:b\nS\n\nM\n:C\n\nh\no\n\nl \n1\n\n:1\n:1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nD\nO\n\nP\nC\n\n:b\nS\n\nM\n:C\n\nh\no\n\nl \n1\n\n:1\n:1\n\n \n\n0\n.1\n\n m\no\n\nl \n%\n\n G\nM\n\n1\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nD\nO\n\nP\nC\n\n:b\nS\n\nM\n:C\n\nh\no\n\nl \n1\n\n:1\n:1\n\n \n\n1\n m\n\no\nl \n\n%\n G\n\nM\n1\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 20: Representative images of CtxB5-Alexa 647 titration on DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 phase separated \n\nmonolayers containing 0 (A), 0.1 (B) and 1 (C) mol % GM1.

LIPID MONOLAYER CHARACTERIZATION \n\nThe developed miniaturized trough is shown to allow for robust characterization of \n\nmorphology and mobility of monolayers. More specifically, monolayer homogeneity \n\nmeasurements at the studied MMA were accompanied by FCS assay which revealed a linear \n\ntendency of diffusion coefficients as a function of lipid density, as expected from the free area \n\nmodel proposed by Galla et al. in 1979. Moreover, the obtained ac values for DMPC (36.2 \u00b1 \n\n4.72 / 37.2 \u00b1 13.75 \u00c5\n2\n in samples with different labels) are in good agreement with the \n\nliterature. Nevertheless some deviations are expected at extreme lipid densities (50 and 100 \n\nMMA) as small variations in lipid deposition result in great lipid packing differences \u2013 \n\nformation of S and G phases respectively, which will influence the monolayer mobility. \n\n* 4.2. PROTEIN-MONOLAYER BINDING \n\nFor both proteins, the results uncover the influence of lipid packing, and thus of lipid mobility \n\nand ?, on protein binding \u2013 streptavidin and CtxB5 bind stronger to the membrane at low lipid \n\ndensities and, accordingly, low ? and high lipid mobility. Although streptavidin appears to bind \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n45 \n\nstronger to lipid monolayers, CtxB5 present a stronger surface activity as its binding to clean \n\nbuffer-air interface is higher. Moreover, phase separated mixtures illustrate this behavior \u2013 \n\nproteins show higher affinity for loose LE phase then for tightly packed LC domains. \n\nNonetheless, the surface non-active protein streptavidin tends to accumulate in the domain \n\nboundaries when the difference in lipid organization between domains is very high\u2013 for \n\nexample in LE/S phase separations. Furthermore, titration experiments with CtxB5 support this \n\nresult as at 90 MMA the interface protein intensity is higher than at 50 MMA. Interestingly, \n\nthese results confirm predictions made four decades ago through surface pressure variation \n\nstudy of different lipid monolayers on protein addition (Phillips et al, 1975; Fidelio et al, 1981; \n\nCumar et al, 1982). \n\nA specific binding could be obtained for CtxB5 only by incorporation of GM1 in the monolayer. \n\nAlthough binding curves do not show it clearly, titration experiments reveal that the presence \n\nof 0.1 mol % GM1 is enough to highly increase protein binding to the monolayer. Also, the \n\npreviously observed influence of lipid density is retained in presence of a specific ligand. \n\nHowever, in phase separated mixtures containing GM1, protein binds preferentially to LC \n\ndomains, as the ganglioside is preferentially distributed in these rigid domains (Rock et al, \n\n1991; Vi\u00e9 et al, 1998; Yuan &amp; Johnston, 2000; Menke et al, 2002). \n\nBesides the influences of lipid packing and presence of ligand, it was also shown that the pool \n\nof available protein have an impact on the obtained results, in accordance with previous \n\nstudies (Phillips et al, 1975; Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982). This could be mediated by \n\nboth the protein concentration and the ratio between available surface area and protein \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n47 \n\nFINAL REMARKS \n\nProtein-lipid interactions are one of the major focuses of membrane research as they play a \n\ncentral role in membrane organization, metabolism and signaling processes. Although a \n\npossible influence of lipid packing on protein binding to lipid layers had been proposed four \n\ndecades ago (Phillips et al, 1975; Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982), the methods available \n\nat the time were not enough to prove it. \n\nLipid monolayer is a classical model system which has been rather neglected in recent \n\nmembrane research, even though it allows easy manipulation oflipid packing. Here, it is shown \n\nthat despite its simplicity, the assay can be used to address current challenging biological \n\nproblems, by convenient coupling with high resolution and high sensitivity techniques, such as \n\nconfocal microscopy and FCS. \n\nThe miniaturized trough recently developed by Chwastek and Schwille is shown here to allow \n\nthe deposition of monolayers with highly robust morphological and lipid mobility \n\ncharacteristics. Due to its reproducibility, low volume and technical versatility, the applied \n\nsystem can be easily used in protein binding assays. Two well-characterized proteins \u2013 \n\nstreptavidin and CtxB5 \u2013 were chosen for the validation of the proposed method, based on \n\nprotein fluorescence measurement at both monolayer interface and subphase. \n\nHere, by using this system in a semi-quantitative way, new evidence of the importance of lipid \n\npacking in protein-membrane interaction is achieved. It is shown that proteins easily penetrate \n\nthe monolayer at low lipid densities, while at high ?, the interaction is reduced. Phase \n\nseparation serves as a mechanism of regulation of protein binding regulation not only through \n\ndifferential lipid packing but also ligand segregation. In addition, protein pool and available \n\nsurface affect the binding as a function of protein concentration. \n\nThe presented system provides a powerful alternative approach to study protein-membrane \n\ninteractions, allowing tuning of membrane parameters as lipid packing, which cannot be easily \n\nregulated in bilayers. The robust combination with confocal microscopy and spectroscopy, not \n\nonly results in a high temporal resolution of particle mobility, but also achieves high spatial \n\nresolution in an assay. Altogether, the presented work was the first attempt to develop \n\nfluorescence-based quantitative assay which could be used to monitor binding of the protein \n\nto lipid monolayers. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n49 \n\nFUTURE PERSPECTIVES \n\nDespite the robustness of the method when applied to lipid analyses, some problems remain \n\nto be solved \u2013 the lipid probes do not distribute homogeneously in the monolayer. Thus, at \n\nincreasing ? one does not observe a consistent increase in the number of molecules in the Veff. \n\nIt is possible that at high surface pressures probe Kp between the water subphase and the \n\nmonolayer is decreased, resulting in its partial exclusion from the monolayer. On the other \n\nhand, the increase in lipid density can increase weak interactions between different particles, \n\nresulting in dye clustering. Thus, further studies are needed to understand fluorophore \n\nbehavior in lipid monolayers. \n\nA better characterization of CtxB5 and streptavidin unspecific binding to monolayers remain to \n\nbe done. The nature of protein interaction with lipids can be further studied by manipulation \n\nof buffer conditions (e.g. salt content and concentration, pH). Also, variation of the amount of \n\nthe ligand in the monolayer can give new insight into ligand-protein interactions. For \n\nstreptavidin, in order to study its specific binding to monolayer surface, one could substitute \n\nstreptavidin for the mutant form ExtrAvidin or Neutravidin which have shown better results in \n\nlipid bilayers. \n\nAdditionally, accurate protein binding quantification and KD determination was not yet \n\nachieved. The high standard deviations associated to the binding assays seem to be related to \n\na non-homogeneous incorporation of the protein in the lipid monolayer. Some of the error \n\nmight originate from meniscus formation and discrepancies introduced during monolayer \n\ndeposition and protein addition. Thus further standardization of applied lipid and protein \n\nsolution volume, concentration and condition should be done. \n\nFurther, additional factors such as lipid oxidation, subphase evaporation and ? difference are \n\nneither monitored nor controlled here. The use of a ROS scavenger system added to the \n\nsubphase could help to reduce lipid oxidation, even though the hydrophobic carbon tails are \n\npointed towards the air. Also, the creations of a tiny well around the chamber would allow for \n\na better sample sealing when filled with water, helping to control evaporation. Due to the \n\nsmall chamber size the use of a Wilhelmy plate for ? monitoring is hindered. Nonetheless, it is \n\npossible to calculate ? through physical wave formation and its decay analysis. \n\nIn future, it is expected to get a more complete and quantified characterization of streptavidin \n\nand Ctx binding to lipid monolayers; particularly, the influences of lipid packing and ligand \n\ncontent. For example, the application of fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) \n\ntechnique could provide a more concrete analysis of specific interaction between the protein \n\nand its ligand. Ultimately, monolayers have the potential to provide a quantitative protein \n\nbinding assay, which would be easily applied for other biologically relevant proteins \u2013 such as \n\nFCHo2, an F-BAR protein responsible for sensing and inducing membrane curvature. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n51 \n\nSYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS \n\n?
