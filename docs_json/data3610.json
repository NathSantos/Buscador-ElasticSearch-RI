It is discussed the role of waters: activities/concentrations of chemical species, pH, Eh,\n\nimportance of complexes. Weathering is not only a destructive process. It can concentrate chemical\n\nspecies and form mineral deposits (kaolin, bauxite, Fe, Mn, P, Nb, Au). Weathering studies are\n\nimportant in pedology, engineering geology, hydrogeology, paleoclimatology and ecology. The\n\nuse of stonemeal is based upon the study of rock weathering.\n\nKey words: chemical weathering, hydrolysis of silicates, biological weathering, physicochemical\nparameters of weathering.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWeathering is a process characterized mainly by physical disaggregation and chemical decompo-\n\nsition of rocks transforming structures of more complex minerals in others with simpler structures.\n\nThe transformation of tectosilicates (feldspars) in 1:1 phylosilicates represents well this process.\n\nAt the same time the neoformation of minerals such as kaolinites, iron oxides (goethite, hematite),\n\naluminum oxides-hydroxides (gibbsite, boehmite) which are stable at low temperature and pres-\n\nsure (25?C, 1 atm) replacing higher temperature and pressure minerals is also representative of\nsupergene alteration.\n\nThe supergene alteration is dependent upon climate (rainfall and temperature), topography,\n\nnature of rock (fissural system, texture and composition), influence of biosphere and controlled by\n\ndrainage conditions of the profile.\n\n*Member Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias\nE-mail: milton.formoso@ufrgs.br\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\n810 MILTON L.L. FORMOSO\n\nThe hydrolysis of silicates is the most important process during the weathering. For example:\n\n2KAISi3O8s,c,K-feldspar + 11H2Ol = 4H4SiO4aq + Al2Si2O5(OH)4s,c,kaolinite + 2K+aq + 2OH?aq\ns = solid; c = crystalline; aq = aqueous; l = liquid\n\nHydrolysis of silicates is characterized by increasing of pH (OH?), leaching of alkaline and\nearth alkaline cations and the partial or total leaching of H4SiO4. The formation of kaolinite means\n\na partial leaching of H4SiO4.\n\nThe supergene alteration of rocks produces \u201c alterites\u201d (Figs. 1 and 2). Alterites are constituted\n\nby neoformed supergenic minerals plus some primary minerals from preexisting rocks. (Fig. 1 \u2013\n\n(Pedro 1985 in Melfiet al. 1999)).\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Alteration cover (alterite + soil) in relation to atmosphere and continental biosphere (Pedro 1985).\n\nCHEMICAL WEATHERING OF MINERALS\n\nIn principle, all minerals can undergo destruction by weathering but normally the primary minerals\n\nare less resistant than the secondary ones. Minerals can be listed according to their degree of\n\nresistance to weathering. Fig. 3 displays a list of minerals in order of increasing resistance to\n\nweathering.\n\nNote: The exact position of minerals depends upon grain size, environmental conditions. Sec-\n\nondary minerals are at the bottom of the list as it could be expected. (See also Loughnan 1969,\n\nCarrol 1970, Berner and Berner 1996).\n\nThe weathering of silicates especially their dissolution is not clearly explained. Muir and\n\nNesbitt 1992, conclude that silicate dissolution occurs by means of a protective layer of altered\n\ncomposition which inhibits the migration of dissolved species to and from the surface of the mineral\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\nSOME TOPICS ON GEOCHEMISTRY OF WEATHERING: A REVIEW 811\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Lateritic profile of a tropical soil (Melfiet al. 1999).\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Mineral weatherability (decreasing from top to bottom)\n\nPyrite\n\nCalcite\n\nDolomite\n\nOlivine\n\nCa \u2013 plagioclase\n\nPyroxenes\n\nCa \u2013 Na plagioclase\n\nAmphiboles\n\nBiotite\n\nK \u2013 feldspar\n\nMuscovite\n\nSmectite\n\nQuartz\n\nKaolinite\n\nGibbsite, hematite\n\n(Berner and Berner 1996). However, detailed studies showed that the existence of the protective\n\nlayer could not be proved. It seems more reasonable that most silicate react with soil solutions not as\n\na homogeneous process but more as a selective etching controlled by crystallographical directions\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\n812 MILTON L.L. FORMOSO\n\n(dislocations) on the mineral surface. (Nahon 1991). In general different chemical compositions\n\nand the formation of etch pits (feldspars, pyroxenes and amphiboles) control the dissolution of\n\nminerals.\n\nHoldsen and Berner (1979) and Meunier (2003) present a discussion on the dissolution of pri-\n\nmary phases during the supergene alteration. Meunier (2003) emphasizes that the dissolution starts\n\nby the more energetic sites: surface, edges and vertices. The supergene alteration advances under\n\ncorrosion zones formed by the coalescence of dissolution of materials at the sites of dissolution.\n\nBIOLOGICAL WEATHERING\n\nAlthough the weathering of rocks is both a mechanical and mainly a chemical process the biological\n\ninfluence is very important in the changes suffered by the rocks close to the surface. Acids produced\n\naround the roots of living plants and by the bacterial decomposition of plants interact with rock\n\nminerals increasing the chemical alteration of those minerals.\n\nThe upper part of the soil is a zone of intense biochemical activity. The bacterial population\n\nnear the surface is large but decreases downward with a steep gradient. The organic acids mainly\n\nthose with low molecular weight attack silicate minerals which commonly dissolve incongruently.\n\nFor instance, an organic acid, as oxalic acid, dissociates to form H+ ions:\n\nH2C2O4aq = 2H+aq + C2O2?4aq\nThe H+ ions attack the silicate liberating its constituent chemical species:\n\nH+aq + 4H2Ol + silicate = Al3+aq + Mn+aq + mH4SiO4aq\nThe C2O\n\n2?\n4 reacts with Al\n\n3+ to form a chelate:\n\nAl3+aq + C2O2?4aq = Al(C2O4)+aq\nThis latter reaction is a dissolution reaction very common at the uppermost acid portion of\n\nmost temperate soils.\n\nBacterial activity is responsible by the decomposition of the Al(C2O4)\n+ and H2C2O4. The\n\noxalic acid and the oxalate are oxidized to CO2 and HCO\n?\n3 and the Al\n\n3+ is liberated and precipitates\nas Al(OH)3 or clay minerals. Thus the organic acids are responsible mainly by the low pH and\n\nformation of organic complexes. The process does not preserve the organic acid.\n\nWEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION\n\nWhen alterite material comes into contact with air (atmosphere), water (hydrosphere) and biosphere\n\n(decomposing organic matter, living plants and animals) (Figs. 1 and 2), becomes organized into\n\nstructural patterns (soils) under the influence of the environmental conditions. Perhaps, climate\n\nis the principal control of soil formation. High rainfall and low temperature both favor the accu-\n\nmulation of organic debris in soils (Loughnan 1969, Retallack 1990). Retallack (1990) displays a\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\nSOME TOPICS ON GEOCHEMISTRY OF WEATHERING: A REVIEW 813\n\nsoil classification with ten types of soils according to climate and evolution. For example, oxysol\n\nis considered a deeply weathered, reddish, kaolinite, clay-rich and iron-rich soil of tropical hu-\n\nmid climates with almost no remaining primary minerals (formerly called laterites, lateritic soils,\n\nlatosols). In tropical soils there is little burial of organic matter and there is still intense leaching\n\nof cations and silica due to heavier rainfall (> 2000 mm per year). According to Melfiand Pedro\n\n1977, the laterite and oxysols (latosols) cover about 65% of Brazil\u00b4s total surface, prevailing in all\n\nof Amazon, Central and Southeastern regions of this country (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 Area of lateritic cover (laterite and latosols) in Brazil (Melfiand Pedro 1977).\n\nWATERS\n\nRain waters coming into contact with rocks (and derived soils) react with primary and secondary\n\nminerals or amorphous phases modifying the compositions of those waters. Rain waters increase\n\ntheir content of ions released from the rocks and organic matter from the biosphere constituting\n\nthe soil waters. The composition of surface waters (in tropical and temperate areas) is represented\n\nby common cations Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, K+ and normally the principal anion is HCO?3 . Activity\nof ions, pH, Eh, complex ions can control the composition of soil, surface and ground waters. In\n\ndilute solutions activities and concentrations are almost equal because the activity coefficients are\n\nclose to one (a = ? m; a = activity; m = concentration and ? = activity coefficient).\n\na \u2013 pH\n\npH (= ?log aH+ ) is controlled by the activity of various anions and cations. The\n?\n\nCO2 = aH2CO3 + aHCO?3 + aCO2?3\n(or in dilute solutions the concentrations of those anions) is very important in controlling the pH.\n\nThe presence of organic acids is also of great importance. There is a competition between the\n\nhydrolysis of silicates and the decomposition (bacterial or chemical decomposition) of organic\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\n814 MILTON L.L. FORMOSO\n\nmaterial. The rain water is a dilute solution of carbonic acid and its pH is around 5.65 (without\n\npollution). Rain water and surface waters coming into contact with rocks react with them which\n\nrelease cations, H4SiO4 and OH\n? from the hydrolysis of silicates. Normally without the presence\n\nof organic matter and vegetation, the hydrolysis of silicates predominates and the pH is higher than\n\n7. The OH? predominates in comparison with organic acids and the pH is basic as happens in\nsemiarid climates. In ground waters, the confined interaction between meteoric waters and rocks is\n\nstill the most important factor and the influence of organic matter and products of its decomposition\n\nis much less important. The pH of ground waters is generally higher than 7. In surface waters (and\n\nin soil waters), the hydrolysis of silicates and the OH? produced are neutralized by the CO2aq and\nby the organic acids formed in soils from the decomposition of organic debris. The resultant pH\n\nis lower than 7, in general, between 5.5 and 7 without anthropic pollution. In organic layers of the\n\npodsols, the pH may reach 3.5. The industrial contamination increases the content of sulfuric and\n\nnitric acids of the rain water constituting the acid rain. Normally the acid rain waters destroy the\n\nbuffering ability of HCO?3 leading to the decrease of pH of waters.\nIn sea water, there is also a competition between the acid volcanic gases and the hydrolysis\n\nof silicates (Sill\u00e9n 1961); the acid volcanic gases are CO2, HCl, HF, SO2, H2S and the hydrolysis\n\nof silicates is from sea floor and from erosion products of continents. The resultant pH is around\n\n8.2\u2013 8.4. The sea water is buffered by the system\n?\n\nCO2 especially the HCO\n?\n3 ion.\n\nThe HCO?3 presents buffering ability in sea water and also in lakes and even in some rivers. The\nequation HCO?3aq + H+aq = H2CO3aq shows that the H+ reacts with HCO?3 forming H2CO3 which\nionizes very little. The concentration of HCO?3 is almost equal at pH = 6.4 and 10.3 explaining\nthe buffering behavior of HCO?3 at a\n\n?\nCO2 = 10?3 (Fig. 5). In the presence of carbonate rocks\n\nthe buffering ability of HCO?3 increases because of higher HCO\n?\n3 concentration:\n\nH+aq + CaCO3s = Ca2+aq + HCO?3aq .\n\nb \u2013 Eh\n\nThe oxidation potential is another important parameter for the definition of geochemical charac-\n\nteristics of water. Chemical species of Fe, S, Mn, C present several oxidation numbers and have\n\ntheir behaviors dependent of Eh. The ratio Fe3+/Fe2+ is very important and the tendency is the\noxidation of Fe2+aq and the precipitation of Fe(OH)3 (or goethite and hematite). In latosols, the\noxidation-reduction of the Fe species is responsible (Fe2+aq = Fe3++ e?) by the dissolution \u2013 pre-\ncipitation of the Fe in this type of soil associated certainly to the oscillation of water table in wet\n\nand dry seasons.\n\nSulfur species especially S2? and SO2?4 are important in terms of Eh/pH and the occurrence\nof sulfides (FeS2) and SO\n\n2?\n4 are quite characteristic. In acid mine drainage (Kim and Chon 2001,\n\nRoisenberg et al. 2004), the oxidation of pyrite forms Fe2+aq , SO\n2?\n4aq + 2H+aq and the later oxidation\n\nof Fe2+ to Fe3+ (or Fe(OH)3). The pH reaches values close 2 and Fe3+aq is in solution. When the\npH increases, the Fe3+ precipitates. Manganese species present five oxidation numbers (2+, 3+,\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\nSOME TOPICS ON GEOCHEMISTRY OF WEATHERING: A REVIEW 815\n\nFig. 5 \u2013\n?\n\nCO2 (carbonate species) versus pH ?\n?\n\nCO2 = 10?3 mol/l.\n\n4+, 6+ and 7+). The Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ are very common and Mn6+ and Mn7+ are normally\npresent in laboratory conditions (MnO2?4 and MnO\n\n?\n4 ). The most common oxidation reaction in\n\nterms of manganese is Mn2+aq + 2H2Ol = MnO2s,c + 4H+aq + 2e?.\nMn2+ is more stable than Fe2+; in other words, the oxidation of Fe2+ is faster than Mn2+.\nThe oxidation of carbon compounds to CO2 is one of the most common oxidation processes\n\nin nature. The oxidation of carbon chemical species to CO2, H2CO3 or HCO\n?\n3 is very common in\n\nsoils, sediments and waters.\n\nOther oxidation of ions as\n\nU4+aq = U6+aq + 2e?; Ce3+aq = Ce4+aq + e? and Eu2+aq = Eu3+ + e?\n\nare also important but not so common as those described above (Fe, S, Mn, C). The use of Eh-pH\n\ndiagrams became very frequent in geochemical literature in the last fifty years. (Garrels and Christ\n\n1965).\n\nc \u2013 Complex ions\n\nComplex ions (inorganic or organic), ionic pairs (sea water) are association between ions or with\n\nother chemical species which are responsible by the transport of chemical species in solution. The\n\nstability of complex ions depends on their constants of stability. Carbonates form more stable\n\ncomplexes with HREE than LREE (it depends on ionic radius).\n\nAPPLICATION OF WEATHERING STUDIES\n\na \u2013 The weathering is not only a destructive process. The rocks are leached by rain, soil and surface\n\nwaters and many chemical species are dissolved and transported. However, the residual material\n\nmay represent a concentration of chemical species constituting a mineral deposit. The final result\n\nis the formation of laterites and lateritic soils. Mineral deposits such as of Fe, Mn, P, Nb, Au,\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\n816 MILTON L.L. FORMOSO\n\nkaolin and bauxites may be formed in lateritic environment. (Fig. 6). For example, the genesis of\n\nkaolin of Rio Jar\u00ed (Montes et al. 2002) is related to the weathering of Cretaceous Alter do Ch\u00e3o\n\nFormation (Amazon) with the neoformation of a new generation of kaolinite and leaching of iron\n\nresulting in an enrichment of kaolinite forming the important deposits of Rio Jar\u00ed kaolin. Similarly,\n\nat the high places the more advanced leaching of H4SiO4 led to the formation of bauxites.\n\nFig. 6 \u2013 The solubility of aluminum hydroxide, amorphous silica and ferric oxide in terms of ph in superficial conditions.\n\nIn deposits of Fe and Mn is very common the oxidation and dissolution \u2013 precipitation of Fe\n\nand Mn, respectively.\n\nb \u2013 In many cases, a thick lateritic cover might hide deeper important mineral deposits and we\n\nmay use geochemical prospection of soils, sediments and waters for making the prospection of the\n\nelements we look for.\n\nc \u2013 Other important application of weathering studies is the transformation of lateritic soils (or\n\nlatosols) in podzols \u2013 (Pedro 1985, Lucas et al. 1989, Melfiet al. 1999).\n\nIt is a unique example the transformation of yellow latosol in podsol that occurs in the Amazon\n\nregion as an effect of hydromorphism (Melfiet al. 1999). (Figs. 7 and 8) \u2013 Latosols become white\n\nquartz sands. The soils associated to the Cretaceous Alter do Ch\u00e3o Formation are progressively\n\nmore arenaceous toward their lower parts by the dissolution of iron species and kaolinite. The soils\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\nSOME TOPICS ON GEOCHEMISTRY OF WEATHERING: A REVIEW 817\n\nwill become more acid until the forests start degrading being replaced by \u201c campinarana\u201d, a new\n\ntype of vegetation. The podzolization is characterized by the whitening of upper horizons with\n\nthe individualization of a humic B horizon. The podzolided soils are formed from latosols in a\n\ntransformation system (latosol \u2013 podzol).\n\nTwo types of water streams draining the system can be found. One type drains the lateritic\n\nbasin; it displays clear water and is poor in dissolved organic material, high dissolved Si species\n\nand very low concentration of Al and Fe species. The second type, which drains podzolic regions,\n\nhas brownish waters due to dissolved organic material and also has high concentration of iron\n\nand aluminum chemical species and low content of silicon dissolved species. The particulate\n\nfraction is important being made up of quartz, kaolinite and gibbsite. Organic-metalic complexes\n\nare responsible by the transport of Al and Fe species in solution (Melfiet al. 1999).\n\nFig. 7 \u2013 Stages of evolution of the lateritic \u2013 podzol soil systems in the Amazon Basin (Melfiet al. 1999).\n\nFig. 8 \u2013 Hydrogeological of ferralic and podzolic soils.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (4)\n\n\n\n818 MILTON L.L. FORMOSO\n\nd \u2013 Studies of weathering are fundamental in Engineering Geology, Hydrogeology and practical\n\napplications of Geology. In Engineering Geology, the search of materials used in the construction\n\nof roads, dams and houses include certainly studies of supergene alteration of those materials.\n\nIn Hydrogeology, the studies of ground and surface waters obviously involve the interaction\n\nwater-rock (also supergene alterations).\n\ne \u2013 Paleoclimatology and Ecology are very dependent on research in weathering. For example,\n\nthe study of alterites and soils is important because they may be associated to the development of\n\nvegetation (including forests), playing an important role in the bioclimatic balance of the planet\n\n(Melfiet al. 1999).\n\nAlterites (especially laterites) are important marks in Paleoclimatology mainly in regions\n\ntectonically stable.\n\nSTONEMEAL\n\nAccording to Leonardos and Theodoro 1999, \u201c Under our conditions of lateritic soils we must,\n\nas an important step towards sustainable development, restore to the leached soils, the balanced\n\ninorganic meal on which crops and biodiversity can be properly fed. Stonemeal is Nature\u2019s approach\n\nto achieve overall soil fertility. The use of soluble fertilizers like NPK is only supported in limited\n\namounts and only if coupled or preceded by stonemeal soil reminalization.\u201d\n\nThe use of stonemeal has as principle the weathering of rocks with release of major species\n\nas (H4SiO4, Ca\n2+, Na+, Mg2+, K+) or minor species (Ni2+, CO2+, Cr3+ and others), correction of\n\npH (OH? from hydrolysis of silicates).\nThe choice of the rock and conditions for stonemeal depends on various factors:\n\na \u2013 Chemical composition \u2013 for example, basic and alkaline rocks are ideal; rocks rich in SiO2,\n\nespecially quartz, are not adequate. Volcanic rocks are very good because the supergene\n\nalteration is not slow (fine grain, sometimes glass);\n\nb \u2013 The transport of the rocks may not be long (increase cost);\n\nc \u2013 The addition of organic material together is certainly very important because it would bring\n\nabout a faster alteration of the stonemeal;\n\nd \u2013 Normally the stonemeal must precede (or be simultaneous with) the addition of other fertilizers.\n\nRESUMO\n\nIntemperismo \u00e9 um processo complexo compreendendo desagrega\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica, decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica e bio-\n\nl\u00f3gica de rochas e minerais transformando minerais de estrutura complexa em estruturas mais simples.\n\nHidr\u00f3lise de silicates \u00e9 talvez o mais importante mas certamente associado ao intemperismo biol\u00f3gico.\n\n\u00c9 discutido o papel da \u00e1gua: atividades/concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de esp\u00e9cies qu\u00edmicas, pH, Eh, import\u00e2ncia dos\n\ncomplexos.
