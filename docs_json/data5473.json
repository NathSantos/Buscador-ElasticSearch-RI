First, we investigate whether the returns of industry portfolios forecast future stock market return. We also investigated a particular set of traditional macroeconomic variables as predictors. Using traditional linear regressions, we discovered that three out of nine industries and five out of eight macroeconomic predictors are statistically significant. However, all the models based on these predictors have negative pseudo R-squared values, therefore, they underperform the historical average model out-of-sample. We also show that two out of nine forecast models, based on significant predictors, provide utility gains for a mean-variance investor.\nJEL Classification: C22, C53, G11, G17\nTo maintain and stimulate the economic growth of Russia, it is necessary to provide a well-developed financial center. The Russian stock market, today it is not sufficiently developed. The national stock market has limited capacity, insufficient to ensure investment needs of Russian companies, lags behind the largest and most developed equity markets in the world. The Russian stock market evolution will help to ensure balance, innovation-based and stable Russian economic growth in the long run.\nIn the opinions of many analysts, the Russian stock market is expected to decline further. The almost complete absence of the collective investment schemes, as well as the low investment attractiveness as a whole, is among the factors of the weakness of the Russian equity capital market. In this regard, the question about an appropriate forecasting method for the Russian stock market prices is really significant, because it would allow both small and large investors to predict the movement of the Russian stock market, to make a profit, and to increase the activity on the Russian stock market in general.\nForecasting stock market performance has a high significance for many economic problems. Successful forecasting the future equity premium could lead to obtaining a considerable return. Investors always take into account the historical price performance to form the forecast of future market movement and to make an investment decision.\nThe stock return predictability represents a widely studied subject in the economic literature. There are various points of view on predictions in the field of the stock market performance. For instance, the efficient market hypothesis assumes that the stock prices reflect all currently available information and all changes in the prices are not dependent on information recently revealed, thus, movements of the market prices could not be predicted on the whole. The opposite point of view says that there are different methods that allow generating information about the future market prices. The equity premium predictability problem and forecasting methods of stock market movements still remain open and controversial.\nii)\tTo choose the most suitable methods of prediction and apply these to analyze the Russian stock market;\niii)\tTo find out whether the returns of industry portfolios could forecast movement of the stock market in Russia;\niv)\tTo determine the sectors and macroeconomic indicators whose predictive ability is higher for the Russian stock market;\nv)\tTo create forecasts of the Russian stock market movement, using the predictive models based on the returns of industry portfolios and other indicators;\nvi)\tTo investigate whether the derived models are more profitable for a risk averse investor than the model based on the historical price data.\nThe empirical model is mainly based on the analysis of Hong et al. (2007). For the purpose of this work, the initial database will be analyzed through the two periods. First, we will apply in-sample (full sample) performance evaluation. We are going to use traditional predictive regressions, which include industry and other macroeconomic indicators and market returns. Second, we will provide out-sample performance evaluation. We are going to divide the total sample into two periods: from t to t1, and from t1 to t2. In the beginning, we will estimate the model, using data from the period t to t1, and then we will repeat this procedure for the most predictable industries and indicators, using as the out-of-sample period the last three observed years. At the end, we will compute the forecast errors as a difference between real values of the out-of-sample period and the forecasting measures. We should examine, whether the derived model is a better performance predictor than the model based on the historical returns.\nAs the last step of our empirical calculations, we are going to estimate the utility gain for a mean-variance investor and whether it profitable for him to use the equity premium predictions derived from the models to make investment decisions. We are going to compute the difference between the average utility of an investor who based the investment decisions on the predictive model and the average utility of an investor who formed portfolio using only information about the historical mean returns for the out-ofsample period (the net average benefit).\nIn this research, we studied various articles concerning the forecast of the equity premium. There are various methods for implementing this analysis. The most widespread approach is predictive linear regression which reveals dependence between stock market returns and some market indicators, such as inflation, dividend yield or default spread. Most of the existing literature on forecasting stock returns considers that there is a linear relation between market indices and stock returns, put another way, it is possible to predict future stock market movements applying econometric approaches.\nSeveral authors show that despite a number of the existing econometric problems, it is possible to find a considerable predictive component from in-sample studies (for instance, Campbell (1987) found that the interest rate and spreads in the US are significant predictors). It is markedly more difficult to find predictors that are effective out-of-sample. Goyal and Welch (2008) examined a broad set of predictors and concluded, that the most common indicators previously used in this literature are not able to predict returns out-of-sample because predictive regressions are unstable over extended periods. However, Campbell and Thompson (2008) found considerable predictive ability in the out-of-sample period after the application of theoretical restrictions. Later Rapach et al. (2010) showed that the application of a forecast combination generates smoother and more reliable predictions in the real economy, and improves the asset allocation of a risk-averse investor. They also provided evidence that individual forecasts are too volatile.\nSimilar to our research in Hong et al. (2007) the main purpose is to test whether the returns of industry indices forecast stock market movements. The study also verified the hypothesis that the ability of the industries to predict the market movement are correlated with its ability to forecast indicators of economic activity. They used monthly returns to 34 value-weighted industry portfolios for the years from 1946 to 2002 for the U.S. The linear relation between the equity premium and returns for each industry was estimated by GLS. As the main conclusion of this paper, the authors discovered that 14 out of 34 industries are able to forecast market direction by one month. Other industries such as petroleum, metal, and financial can predict the movement even two months ahead. The authors also investigated the crosspredictability at a time horizon of up to six months and it was proved that it is almost impossible to provide a forecast for such a long time lag. The study demonstrated the ability of the industries to predict the stock market returns is strongly linked to their ability to forecast indicators of economic activity. In this paper, they also show that an expansion to each of the largest eight stock markets outside of the U.S. corroborates the U.S results.\nPettenuzzo et al. (2014) used a new method to impose economic restrictions on forecasts of the equity premium and analyzed a broad set of predictors explored in Goyal and Welch, 2008. The database included monthly excess returns from 1927 to 2010. They developed a Bayesian approach that let them estimate the predictive density of the equity premium, based on the traditional linear prediction model, estimated by OLS. As a result, the authors found that economic constraints systematically diminish uncertainty about parameters of the model, and provide better out-of-sample performance at both the statistical and economic levels. Moreover, the gains obtained from the economic constraints tend to increase with the prediction horizon.\nstock market returns over the period from December 1927 to December 2007. The authors used traditional predictive regressions. They concluded that there is significant predictability in equity market returns.\nNyberg and Ponka (2015) used a bivariate probit model for predicting the sign of the equity premium in the U.S. and ten other markets. The major focus of this research is to consider the lead-lag relationships in international asset markets. The objective of this paper is to reveal possible benefits from predicting the signs of returns jointly, focusing on the forecast from the U.S. to the foreign markets. They examined a monthly international dataset containing 11 industrialized countries including the U.S. from 1980 to 2010. In the conclusion, it was proved that the stock market returns of the U.S. are an appropriate predictor for stock returns in other foreign markets.\nThe empirical and theoretical forecast research of the stock market returns was conducted taking into account the different time horizon by the group of authors Govorkov et al. (2016). The main interest was to investigate the nature of stock market predictability over different time horizons. In this paper, the authors applied homogeneous and heterogeneous models, figured as a dynamical system to estimate three independent variables: market price, investor sentiment, and information flow. They examined daily returns from 2003 to 2015. Their main conclusions are that in order to predictor the stock market behavior it is necessary to consider the information asymmetry of the market, and also the fact that the collective investors\u2019 opinion, created by merging various individual opinions, that differ according to the time horizons, determines dynamically the prices in the market.\nKong et al. (2009) analyze return predictability for indicators of the aggregate market, including portfolios classified on industry. The database was created from the monthly returns on 33 industry portfolios available from 1945 to 2004 covering the U.S. stock market. In-sample and out-of-sample predictability tests were performed in the context of a bivariate predictive regression model with the help of OLS estimator, and a macroeconomic risk indicator was estimated by CAPM methodology. As result of the paper, it was concluded that industrial portfolios present considerably predictability.\nresearched by Ponka (2014), employing predictive regression and dynamic probit models. He used monthly U.S. data ranging from 1946 to 2012. He concludes, that only a small number of the market indicators have a significant force to predict stock returns. Additionally, it was proved that binary response models surpassed traditional predictive regressions in forecasting the market return.\nMaio (2012) focused on predictability stock market returns using as predictor the difference between the dividend yield of the stock market and the yield of the ten-year Treasury bond yield, also known as the FED model. The author collected monthly data on prices, earnings, and dividends associated with the S&amp;P 500 Index. The result of the research showed that for the one-month time horizon the yield gap has a significant force of a prediction. Moreover, it is significantly more accurate than traditional predictors, such that default spread or the dividend ratio. In the out-of-sample analysis, the yield gap outperforms the historical average, especially when the equity premium is constrained to be positive.\nUhl (2011) seek to explore whether fundamental and behavioral factors influence the U.S. stock returns. He analyzed monthly price return data, covering the U.S. market from January 2003 to December 2010. The author found evidence of significant correlations between stock returns and returns sentiment. Moreover, expectations can forecast movements in stock returns better than macroeconomic factors and over the one month period.\nIn the opinion of Neely et al. (2014) academic literature relies extensively on macroeconomic variables to predict the movement of the stock market, and relatively less attention is paid to the technical indicators. The main purpose of this study is to cover this gap and to compare the predictive ability of macroeconomic variables and technical indicators. In the research, the authors applied in-sample and out-of-sample analyses of the regression model using OLS estimation. They examined monthly data of 14 macroeconomic indicators of the U.S. stock market, including the dividend yield, the earnings-price ratio, the equity risk premium volatility, the long-term government bond yield, the default yield spread and the inflation over the period from December 1950 to December 2011. As a result of the study, the authors proved that technical indicators have statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive ability, as the macroeconomic variables. In addition, they found that technical indicators\nand macroeconomic variables have different properties of information, in particular, technical indicators (macroeconomic indicators) perform better in a period of a decline (rise) in the risk premium near business-cycle peaks (troughs).\nThere is a vast literature investigating the predictability of the stock market returns, but relatively few studies focus on the impact of various indicators on the performance of the Russian equity capital market. For instance, Rockinger and Urga (2000), found that stock market returns were predictable in Russia, but not in other East European countries. Ivanter and Peresetsky (2000) exploring a Russian daily stock market data for the period from may 1996 to October 1997 conclude that the integration of the Russian market and international financial markets increased during this period.\nJalolov and Miyakoshi (2005) examined monthly data for the period from May 1995 to March 2003 using an EGARCH model. They found evidence that the German market was more strongly correlated with the Russian market than the U.S. market due to the flow of investment between Russia and Germany. They found no significant influence of oil prices on the Russian stock market performance. The authors found, that an application of a one-step prediction with the EGARCH model implies larger mean squared errors than when using the random walk model.\nKutan and Hayo (2005) examine the daily returns of the Russian market, using an asymmetric GARCH model with a t-student distribution of errors. The authors found evidence that lagged Russian stock index returns S&amp;P returns and oil index returns are significant predictors of the Russian stock market performance. They also proved that all news and shocks are not relevant both for forecasting market returns and the market volatility index.\nAnatolyev (2008) explores weekly stock market returns for the periods from January 1995 to January 2005 and from October 1999 to January 2005. The main aim of the study was to test how significant are various macroeconomic and financial indicators for forecasting the Russian stock market. He concluded that the Russian equity capital market is not stable. It was also shown that certain indicators such as oil prices and foreign exchange rates have reduced their influence on the stock return, whereas others, such as the U.S. stock prices and international and domestic interest rates has increased.\nKorhonen and Peresetsky (2013) explores the Russian stock index daily returns for the period from October 1997 to February 2012 and the stable period since 2000 to 2007 using a traditional regression model and estimation models in rolling windows. This research shows that the impact of oil prices on the Russian stock market performance is weak and not regular. They also find evidence indicating a high integration of the Russian stock market in the global world markets. Similar to the results of the study of Anatolyev (2008), the authors concluded that oil prices are not significant after 2006. However, the Japan stock index is significant over the whole studied period. They also found that news like Yukos arrests or Georgian war had only a short-term impact on the Russian stock market performance.\nThe study of Kinnunen (2013) tests whether the conditional multifactor model could predict the movement of Russian equity market. Similarly to our study he used the market industry indices, excluding telecommunications, media and information technology, the exchange rate and the oil price as predictors. He examined monthly Russian stock market data from 1999 to 2012. It was concluded, that in general the Russian stock market has a high level of predictability. However, the sources of predictability change over time. In periods of high volatility and high level of new information, the ability of the conditional multifactor model to forecast stock market is high. During periods of low information flow, there is a relative persistence of the market returns. The lagged global stock market indicator and currency returns are insignificant predictors for the Russian stock market.\nDespite the large diversity of approaches to analyzing and forecasting stock market returns, for the purposes of this study, we chose the most widespread and traditional approach of forecasting stock market performance, specifically, the traditional regression model using OLS estimation. This research is based on the predictability of stock returns depending on the industries of the economy, expressed by the industry indices, and other macroeconomic indicators.\n3 Russian stock market\nToday the Russian stock market is emerging and has a lot of problems that effectively prevent further progress of this market.\nThe history of the Russian stock market began in 1993 when the main regulatory authority (the Commission on securities and stock exchanges) was created. However, in reality, stock trading began only in 1996 at the regional exchanges. First, the trading volume of the largest stock exchange (MICEX) grew rapidly, however, since the beginning of 1998 due to the negative trends in the economy it began to decline. The August 1998 crisis significantly struck the stock price of the biggest companies, and investors suffered very heavy losses. In 1999, the domestic stock market began to recover, Russian and foreign investors tended to buy cheap Russian stocks.\nFigure 1 shows two measures that characterize the dimension of the Russian stock market. Up to 2007, the capitalization of the Russian stock market and the trading volume grew significantly, but in 2008 they declined by 66% and 18% respectively. For comparison, the price of Brent crude oil in 2008 fell by 58%.\nSince 2011, the capitalization of Russian stock market almost has not changed, and the volume of trading in 2012-2014 even decreased compared to 20092011. In 2015-2016, the capitalization of Russian companies grew, however, the volume of trading decreased, which proves that the activity on the Russian stock market declined (figure 2). The ratio of capitalization to GDP reached 100% in 2006-2007, against the background of a rapid growth of both GDP and market capitalization, which corresponds to the level of developed countries. But after the financial crisis in 2008, this ratio decreased from 62% in 2009 to 32% in 2014 both due to GDP growth and lack of growth of capitalization. Therefore, in recent years, the ratio of the national securities market capitalization to GDP diminished. This fact indicates the existence of significant gaps between the capitalization of the stock market and GDP, which also reduces the role of the Russian stock market in the world economy, and makes the domestic market unattractive for investors. In 2015-2016 the ratio of capitalization to GDP increased, partly due to the slowdown of the GDP growth rate.\nby 4,97%. Due to events in Ukraine and economic sanctions against Russia in 2014, the ruble depreciated considerably and the oil prices decreased greatly. These factors contributed to the downfall of the Russian stock market index by 45% at the end of 2014. Figure 3 shows a further decline in MICEX in 2015. Note also that in 2014-2015 there were observed opposite trends of the two main Russian indices: MICEX and RTS (the first one is denominated in Russian rubles, the last one in USD). These facts were driven by the instability of the Russian currency during this period and the weakness of the Russian economy in general. Starting in 2016, the trend of both indices becomes one-directional and mostly positive.\nFigure 1.

The capitalization of the ten largest national companies remained stable over the last five years at around 56% of total market capitalization (table 1). About half of all transactions in 2015 was generated by three securities: PJSC \"Sberbank\", PJSC \"Gazprom\" and PJSC \"LUKOIL\".\nThe number of listed companies decreased by 7,1% in the period after the sanctions, from 266 companies at the end of 2015 to 247 at the beginning of 2017.\nTable 1.

On average the ratio of turnover to capitalization in developed markets is 100% or more during the review period (excluding 2008), while for the Russian market it fluctuates around 45% (figure 4). The ratio of capitalization to GDP in developed countries is 150% on average, whereas in Russia, the maximum value of 100% was achieved once in 2008 (figure 5).\n3\thttp://moex.com/en/indices\n4\tCalculations based on data sources https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-markets and http://moex.com/en/indices\n170.00%\n----Russia cap/GDP ------USA cap/GDP -------UK cap/GDP -------Japan cap/GDP\nFigure 5.

The Russian stock market is also considered to be highly volatile and unstable. We calculated monthly returns\u2019 standard deviations for the MICEX and three foreign indices (FTSE 100, S&amp;P 500 and Nikkei 225) for the period from December 2008 to January 2017, that were equal to 8,39% 4,3%, 4,71% and 6,55% respectively. Therefore, during this period, the volatility of the Russian stock market was almost 2 times higher than the market volatility of the U.K. and the U.S., and 1.3 times higher than the volatility of the Japanese market.\nThe Russian stock market is also characterized by low investment activity of companies and private investors on the market. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the ratio of investment to GDP in some countries. According to this relative indicator,\n5\tCalculations based on data sources https://data.oecd.org and http://www.imf.org/en/data\n6\tCalculations based on data sources http://www.imf.org/en/data and https://www.world-exchanges.org\nRussia is in a satisfactory position. On average, during the analyzed period, the share of investment in GDP in Russia was 20,78%, whereas it was 20,33% in the U.S., 17.29% in the U.K., 21,53% in Japan, 44% in China, 19,09% in Portugal 19,09%, 20,80% in the European Union, and the World average was 22,57%. However, given that GDP per capita at current prices in 2016 for Russia and China were very close (8838,2 USD and 8260,9 USD, respectively, according to the OECD data), we can conclude that Russia is characterized by a low investment activity compared to a country with a similar development. The rest of the countries is characterized by the following GDP per capita values: 19758,7 USD in Portugal, 37304,1 USD in Japan, 40411,7 in the U.K. and 57293,7 in the U.S.\nFigure 7.

Today the Central Bank of the Russian\nFederation officially registered only 7 operating stock exchanges: the largest is MOEX.\nOther 5 exchanges are also located in Moscow (the capital) or Saint-Petersburg (the second most import city of Russia) and specialize predominantly on trading commodities and raw materials, or currencies. The only regional stock exchange is the Crimean stock exchange, located in Simferopol (the third Federal city of Russia). Table 2 presents the share of the capitalization of companies traded on the central Russian stock exchanges (MICEX or MOEX after the reorganization) to total market capitalization from 2011 to 2016. During this period it is 93,3% on average. Therefore, stock trading in Russia is almost entirely realized in one central exchange platform.\n7\tCalculations based on data source https://data.oecd.org\nTable 2.

We calculated the correlation coefficients between MICEX and FTSE 100, S&amp;P 500 and Nikkei 225 monthly rates of return for the period from January 2008 to June 2012. Their values are 0,72, 0,72 and 0,69, respectively. However, in a later period from October 2011 to April 2017, the correlation coefficients decreased to 0,41, 0,34 and 0,29, respectively. Therefore, we may conclude that there is a positive correlation between the MICEX and foreign indices. The higher correlations during the 2008-2012 period can be justified by the 2008 crisis, that strongly affected all economies. Figure 8 also shows scatterplots, which shows the close positive correlation between the MICEX and the relevant indices.\nThe Russian stock market is very young compared to foreign exchanges. It is characterized by high volatility and instability, and other features, among them:\ni)\tLow investment activity of companies and private investors on the market;\nii)\tInsufficient development of regional equity markets;\niii)\tClose positive relationship between the Russian and foreign markets;\niv)\tHigh dependence on commodity prices.\nTo conclude, it was found that since 2011 the development of the Russian stock market has almost stopped. The absolute indicators, characterizing the market scale, remained fixed at the same level, never reaching the value of 2007. The relative indicators, characterizing the level of the market development and its role in the economy, demonstrated a stagnation or a negative trend since 2011. The developed markets continue their upward movement in comparison with Russian stock market, which reached the level of developed countries only once in 2006-2007.\n4\tMethodology\n4.1\tIn-sample\nThe empirical part of our research starts with the in-sample performance evaluation, which covers the full observed sample from January 2008 to January 2017. We are going to use the traditional predictive regression approach, which tests if there is a linear relation between the equity premium and the predictors, as described by Hong et al. (2007), among others\nRMt = at + Predi,t-1+ p\u00a3,2 RMt_1+ eiit,\t(1)\nwhere RMt is the market excess return over the risk-free rate in month t, Predi,t-1 is the predictor i lagged one month, RMt-1 is variable that controls the existence of autocorrelation in the equity premium, and ei t is the error term. We are interested in the coefficients pi#1, which indicates the ability of each predictor to guide the stock market profitability.\nAmong all diverse methods to analyze the predictability of the stock market, we chose the most widespread and traditional approach of evaluation, specifically traditional linear predictive regression (Ordinary least squared estimation). In this approach, we used robust standard errors (that is, corrected for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation). As software support, we used Microsoft Excel and Gretl.\nWe start our study by analyzing the capability of industries returns to predict the movement of the Russian stock market. To estimate the forecasting ability of industries to lead the future stock price we evaluated 9 portfolios using equation 1. We estimate equation 1 separately for each of the 9 industries, namely oil and gas, electric utilities, telecoms, metals and mining, manufacturing, financials consumers\u2019 goods and services, chemicals and transport.\nt = \u00a3-\t(2)\nwhere Pj is the estimated coefficient and St is its standard deviation.\n4.2\tOut-of-sample\nFor the predictors that were identified as significant in-sample, we implement an out-sample performance evaluation. We split the total sample into two periods: from t1 to t, which comprises the period from January 2008 to December 2013, and from t to tn, which covers the period from January 2013 to January 2017.\nFirst, we estimate, for each predictor, model (1), using data from the period tl to t Then we collect the estimated parameters of the regression for the constant, the MICEX index and the predictors for the period t (December 2013).\nTherefore, at the moment t+1 (January 2014) we will predict MICEX return using the estimated coefficients for the previous month applying equation 3:\nR^i,Jan2014 =&lt;^1 + Pi,1 Predi,Dec2013+ Pi,2 ^^Dec2013,\t(3)\nwhere , pj,1 and pj,2 are the estimated coefficients and RMJan2014 is the excess return forecast of the MICEX based on predictor i in January 2014.\nWe are going to repeat this procedure for all industries and indicators of economic activities that exhibit predictive ability in-sample, until the end of the out-ofsample period, which requires estimating 37 regression model for each significant predictor. At the end of this step, we will obtain the MICEX return forecasts for the out-of-sample period, then we will compute the forecast errors as the difference between real MICEX returns in the out-of-sample period and the forecasted returns. We are also going to calculate the mean-squared forecast error (MSFE) from the derived predictive models and mean-squared forecast error from the historical mean (equation 4). We compute the squared errors to estimate whether our model is close to the actual excess returns.\nwhere RMis+1 is the excess return prediction from predictor i, for period s + 1. The MSFE computation starts at the moment t+1, and comprises 37 periods.\nThen we will compute the pseudo R-squared out-of-sample, Rq0S (equation 5). If Rq0S is positive, the derived model outperforms the prediction based on the historical mean.\n2\t_\tMSFEmod\t(5)\nOOS\tu^p^mean,\nwhere MSFEmod represents the measure based on the the model, and MSFEmean is the MSFE from the historical mean (as the sum of squared errors for the out-of-sample period).\nThe out-of-sample forecasting ability of the predictors can be tested using the MSFE-adjusted test statistic similarly to McCraken (2007). This test is used to examine the null hypothesis that the unrestricted model MSFE is equal to the constrained model MSFE, whereas the alternative hypothesis says that the first model's MSFE is lower than the later (equation 6).\nfi.t =\t- RM\u2122ean)2 - [(RMt - RMfi0^2 - (RM\u2122ean - RMfi0^2 ], (6)\nwhere RM\u2122\u00b0d is the excess return forecast for predictor i, at month t, based on the model, and RMt\tis the excess return forecast at month t, based on the historical\nmean. The MSFE-adjusted statistic is calculated by regressing fi t on a constant, and applying the resulting t-statistic for a zero coefficient. The null hypothesis of equal forecast ability is rejected, at the 5% significance level, if the t-statistic exceeds 1,645 (one-sided test).\nIt is well known that forecasts based on a single predictor tend to be too volatile. Thus, we followed Rapach et al. (2010) and tested if combinations of forecasts present better predictive ability than forecast based on a single variable. That is, we also computed the out-of-sample performance of forecasts based on the simple average of: i) significant industry predictors, ii) significant macroeconomic variables and iii) all significant predictors. For these three obtain average forecasts and we also compute the\n4.3\tUtility gains\nIn the last stage of our empirical calculations, we estimate the utility gain for a mean-variance investor, who has to choose which fraction of his wealth to invest in the risk-free asset and the stock market and whether it is profitable for him to use the derived model to make an investment decision. Thus, we will compute the utility gain for a risk-averse investor who uses stock returns' forecasts based on the derived models against an investor who makes his decision based on the historical mean. For this purpose, it is necessary to compute the difference between the average utility of these two investment strategies (equation 7). This difference should be positive if an application of the predictive model generates benefits for a mean-variance investor.\nAy \u2014 -Qmod _ \"mean\n(7)\nFirst, we calculate the utility for an investor who makes his decisions applying the historical mean model. It is required to compute the share of his wealth, wmean, that is optimal to invest in equity at each month t. We consider a mean-variance investor with coefficient of relative risk aversion, y, equal to 5.\n...mean _\nWt -\n1 7?M^e1nn\n-.2\ni,t+\n(8)\nY\n2\nwhere is the rolling window (72 months) estimate of the variance of stock returns. Applying this strategy to forecast excess return, a mean-variance investor will get an average utility given by\nsjmean _ fl\t_ 1 y ee-2\t(9)\nu\tM mean 2 ' umean,\tv 7\nSimilarly, we calculate the share of investments in equities w\u201d|od and the average utility v\u2122od for the mean-variance investor, who makes his decision on the basis of the predictive models (equations 10 and 11):\n...mod _\nwi,t\t=\n(10)\n'-'2.\nY \u00b0i,t+i\n1\n,\n~mod\t*\t1 -^2\n= Vi,mod - - Y \u00b0i,mod,\n(11)\nwhere&lt;%2t+i is the rolling window (72 months) estimate of the variance of stock returns, Vi,mod and d2mod reflect the sample average and variance, respectively, over the out-ofsample period, for the investor\u2019s portfolio formed using predictive model.\nAt the end of the mean-variance investors\u2019 utility evaluation, we also compare the utility from the predictive models with the utility that an investor would get if he was fully invested in the stock market (that is, an investor who chooses a weight equal to 1 for all months).\n5\tDatabase\nIn this work, we analyzed the ability of several variables to predict the equity premium for the Russian stock market over the period from 31.01.2008 to 31.01.2017. We collected monthly data for the MICEX general index returns and several predictors of its evolution, namely:\n-\t9 industry indices returns, including oil and gas, electric utilities, telecoms, metals and\nmining, manufacturing, financials, consumer goods and services, chemicals and transport;\n-\tOther indicators of macroeconomic activity, among them the inflation rate, the bond yield\nspread, the MICEX corporate bond index, the Brent oil price in USD and RUB, the USD/RUB exchange rate, the market volatility index and the dividend yield.\nThus, we examined 16 variables as predictors. The MICEX was taken as the indicator of the dynamic of the Russian equity market. It is calculated as a weighted composite index based on prices of the 50 most liquid Russian stocks of the largest and most dynamic Russian issuers traded on the Moscow Exchange. The MICEX index is denominated in Russian rubles, in contrast, the RTS index, which has the same base of calculation, but it is denominated in USD. We selected the MICEX as the analyzed index, because it is presented in the national currency, therefore it is free from currency risks and represents the movement of the Russian stock market more properly, from the perspective of a Russian investor.\nThe database was obtained from Thomson Reuters Datastream, Eikon, the official website of several Russian statistical services, such as the Moscow exchange, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the Federal State Statistic Service, and other supplementary statistical sources, among them Financial Cbonds information, Stock Markets Analysis of Investing.com and Global world-exchanges.\nIn order to analyze the predictability in the Russian stock market, we had to perform some transformations in the raw data that we collected:\n-\tThe indicator of the Russian stock market performance (the explained variable) was computed as the difference between the MICEX monthly return and the risk-free rate (1-month Russian bond yield obtained from Cbond website);\n-\tFor each industry, the excess industry return was calculated as the difference between the monthly industry return and the risk-free rate;\n-\tBond yield spread was calculated as a difference between the monthly ten-year government bond yield and the risk-free rate;\n-\tThe excess return of the MICEX corporate bond index is the difference between the monthly return of the MICEX corporate bond index and the risk-free rate;\n-\tThe dividend yield was approximated by a weighted average of the dividend yields of the 30 largest companies in the MICEX, according to their weights in the index;\n-\tRegarding the oil prices and the USD/RUB exchange rate, in our research, we used a normalized value of these indicators, which is calculated as the division of their value at the end of the month by their moving average values over the previous 12 months9.\nWe calculated correlation coefficients between absolute values of the MICEX and other predictive variables. The results are presented in table 3. The strongest positive correlation was observed between the MICEX and the oil price, denominated in rubles, and the MICEX and USD/RUB exchange rate (0,51 and 0,53). The strongest negative correlation is between the MICEX and the Russian market volatility index, and the MICEX and the dividend yield (-0,66 and -0,71). The inflation rate and the bond yield spread are weakly correlated with the MICEX returns. Figure 9 also presents scatterplots between the MICEX and some indicators.\nTable 4 displays some descriptive statistics for the equity premium and the predictive variables.\nOn average the mean value of equity premiums of 9 industry portfolios is 0,003 units, the minimum is -0,332 units, the maximum is 0,289 units. Thus, the average of the industry indices excess returns over the study period is almost equal to zero. The mean value of the MICEX excess return is -0,003 units, the minimum is -0,305 units, and the maximum is 0,212 units. It proves the overall negative trend of the Russian stock market during the study period. The mean inflation growth for the period amounted to 0,007 units in the month. The average value of oil price, the USD/RUB exchange rate, the market volatility index and the dividend yield were 1,032 units, 1,060 units, 38,166 points, 0,031 units per month, respectively, during the study period. In opposite, the dynamics of excess return of the corporate bond index was negative, it was -0,001 units on average per month. The skewness is negative for almost all the indicators (except the inflation rate, the USD/RUB exchange rate, the market volatility index and the dividend yield), which means that for most indicators the distributions are left-skewed (right-skewed). All indicators have positive excess kurtosis, which means that the variables have more probability mass in the tails of their distribution than a normally distributed variable. That is, the probability of getting extreme values (either very high or very low) is higher. According to the standard deviation value, electric utilities, metals and mining, manufacturing and chemicals industries have the highest volatility (0,111 units, 0,102 units, 0,113 units and 0,116 units\nTable 4.

The only exception is the transport industry, that has the JB test statistic of 2,59, which is less than the critical value for any significance level, and therefore, the transport industry excess returns could have a normal distribution.\n6\tResults\n6.1 In-sample results\nThe model given by equation 1 was applied to Russian stock market data for the period since January 2008 until January 2017. We used this approach and collected from equation 1 the estimated coefficients, the standard deviations, the t-statistics and the p-values, and the R-squared for each of the 16 variables. This was done sequentially for all indicators to determine their significance as predictors of the MICEX return. This procedure was applied using the Gretl software.

The first 9 variables in the table represent industrial portfolios\u2019 indices, the rest of variables are macroeconomic indicators.\nThe most significant variables according to p-value and t-statistics are the metals and mining industry and the dividend yield (at the 1% significance level). Also the manufacturing and chemicals industries and the excess return of the corporate bond index (at the 5% significance level), and the inflation rate, the USD/RUB exchange rate, and the oil price, denominated in USD (at the 10% significance level) present predictive ability. That suggests that for metals and mining and the dividend yield, we are 99% confident that we obtained estimated regression coefficients that really affect the dependent variable. Therefore, we got 3 significant industry predictors out of 9 and 5 significant macroeconomic predictors out of 8. Hong et al. (2007) discovered that 14 out of 34 industries are able to forecast market direction by one month, he also found that indicators such as the inflation, the dividend yield and the market volatility are also significant for the U.S. stock market (at the 10% significant level), with corresponding coefficients -0,578, 1,418 and 0,241, which are close to the obtained values in our model, except for the inflation coefficient which has the opposite sign. Ponka (2014), for instance found that, on the contrary, only a small number of industries are useful in predicting market movements. In the out-of-sample analysis, it was shown that three industries show predictive ability on the excess market returns at the 5% level and a further three at the 10% level.\nIn this research, the R-squared are low for all the predictors both significant and not significant, which is typical in this kind of studies because the equity premium is notoriously difficult to predict. However, significant variables, such as the dividend yield, the excess return index for corporate bonds, the metals and mining, and manufacturing industries, have the highest R-squared (20,1%, 14,1%, 14,8% and 13,8% respectively). The rest of variables have R-squared values, on average, of 10,3%. Taking into account that R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the fitted data is\nto the realized equity premia, the higher R-squared, the better the model fits the data. However, in our example, the data inevitably contains a large amount of unexplained variability. Moreover, the study period is characterized by high volatility and variability for the Russian stock market. Note, that even though the R-squared are low, the high t-statistics still indicate that there are relevant relations between the predictors and the dependent variable.\nAmong the significant indicators, we conclude, that when the metals and mining industry return increases by 1%, the MICEX return also increases by 0,326%, ceteris paribus, while increasing the manufacturing industry return by 1% leads to an increase of the MICEX return by 0,244%, and increasing chemicals industry return by 1% leads to an increase of the MICEX return by 0,169% Thus, metals and mining, manufacturing and chemicals industries have a significant positive effect on the MICEX dynamics.\nTaking into account that the Russian economy and the Russian stock market, in particular, is strongly correlated with the oil price, it is unexpected that oil price, denominated in RUB, and oil and gas industry are not significant predictors. Moreover, Russia is an oil exporter, which implies that an increase in oil prices should have a positive impact on the MICEX. The oil prices significance was also confirmed by many studies. Anatolyev (2008), for instance, discovered that until 2006 the oil price was a significant predictor with a positive effect on the Russian stock market. On the contrary, Korhonen and Peresetsky (2013) proved that the impact of oil prices on the Russian stock market performance is weak, not regular, and insignificant after 2006. Kutan and Hayo (2005) found that the oil price growth rate is a statistically significant predictor with 99% confidence level in the in-sample analysis (the estimated coefficients is 0,08).\nThe classical economic theory suggests that for developed countries inflation is undesirable but integral to economic growth, it leads the expansion of production, reduces unemployment and increases household expenses. The more profits companies get the more stocks' price increase and stock market growths in general. Normally, the trend of the stock market and inflation are the same in developed countries. According to the Fisher hypothesis, inflation should have a positive effect on stock price due to the fact, that if the expected real return is constant, a higher inflation rate implies a higher stock return. However, there is a surprising international evidence that common stock returns and inflation are negatively related in the post-war period (for instance, Nelson, 1976). The relationship between stock returns and inflation systematically varies in time depending on the ratio of monetary demand and supply. Applying our model, we obtained a significant result: the growth of the inflation rate by 1% causes a rise in the MICEX by 1,84% on average per month.\nThe corporate bond index, as expected, has a positive effect on the MICEX dynamics. Historically, the bonds' return is lower than the return of stocks, and bond and stock compete for investors' funds. Thus, if the corporate bonds return increases, the stocks return must increase, so that stocks remain competitive. In our sample, a growth of corporate bond returns by 1% leads the MICEX excess return to increase by 1,33% on average per month. A similar effect is expected concerning the dividend yield: a high dividend yield should forecast a high MICEX return, thus this coefficient should be positive. In our model, the rise of the dividend yield by 1% leads to a 1,31% increase in the MICEX return on average per month. Our result corroborates the study of Fama and Kenneth (1989), which says, that stock and corporate bond returns change in the same direction, and dividend yields move in a similar way with the long-term business conditions.\nKinnunen (2013) concludes that the predictability of the Russian stock market return is high. He discovered, that the demeaned dividend yield is significant at 10% significance level (with estimated coefficient of 0,009) and excess oil return is significant at the 5% significance level (with the estimated coefficient of -0,257 respectively).\n6.2 Out-of-sample results and the utility gains\nTable 6 shows the MSFE values for the historical mean model and for the significant models (according to equations 4 and 5 in the methodology section). The MSFE value was calculated both for the 8 significant predictors and for the average forecast of significant industries, for the average forecast of significant macroeconomic indicators (excluding the oil price in USD, due to the fact that the estimated coefficient has an unexpected sign and, therefore, it is economic irrelevant as a predictor, as well as for the average forecast of all the 7 significant predictors. From table 6 we can see that every forecast (even the average forecasts) have a larger MSFE value than the model based on a historical mean. Therefore, we got only negative pseudo-^2 for each forecast model, which implies, that all the prediction obtained from the models underperform the forecast based on the historical mean, in a mean-squared sense10. Note, that the metals and mining, chemicals industries and industries\u2019 average forecast have the best MSFE value (0,0028, 0,0030 and 0,0030 against 0,0025 of the historical mean model). The highest errors were observed in the forecast models based on the USD/RUB exchange rate and the general average forecast (both of 0,0045).\nTable 6.

We are interested in the last two columns in the table that represent the net\naverage benefit per month for an investor who uses the predictive model. The first utility difference was calculated between the average utility of derived model (the fraction of the investment in the stock market, in this case, was calculated according to equation 10 from the methodological section) and the average utility of the historical mean model. The last column was calculated as the difference between the average utility of the derived model and the average utility of an investor who fully contributes all his funds in the stock market. The last measure is positive for the metals and mining industry, the excess return of corporate bond index and the USD/RUB exchange rate. The chemical industry and the dividend yield were found the most economically attractive predictors, given that they have a positive utility difference on both columns. This indicator can be interpreted as the percentage of the investor\u2019s wealth, which he is willing to pay per month to have access to the model\u2019s predictions. For instance, a mean-variance investor with the risk aversion coefficient of five is willing to pay 0,091% of his wealth per month in order to use the predictive model based on dividend yield.\nTable 7.

(2014), similarly to our research, presented the economic performance of portfolios based on out-of-sample return forecasts using a coefficient of risk aversion of five. They found a negative utility difference both for the model based on log dividend yield (-0,26%) and for the model based on inflation (-0,09%).\nTherefore, evaluating the utility difference, which represents the economic gains that can be obtained by an investor who uses the model to choose the fraction of wealth to invest in the stock market, we obtained 5 models that outperform a strategy that fully invests in the stock market. Whereas the pseudo R-squared out-of-sample, as a statistical measure of performance, presents negative results for all estimated models. Therefore, we may conclude that the models underperform the forecasts based on the historical average at the statistical level.\nThe general conclusion of our study is similar to the conclusions of many other studies. It is really difficult to predict the stock market movement. Using separately only any conventional macroeconomic indicator or industry portfolio as a predictor, not many of them present predictive abilities. Furthermore, applying the predictive models based on traditional methods (such as predictive linear regression) without additional constraints or conditions and techniques, in general, derived predictive regression forecasts based on these predictors fail to outperform the historical average out-of-sample.\n7\tConclusion\nThe Russian stock market is relatively young. It began its functioning in the 1900s, but due to the economic and social tensions in Russia, most of the trading started only with the beginning of the 2000s. The remaining 17 years covered two major economic crises. The Russian stock market is still characterized by problems such as high volatility, low investment attractiveness and activity, high commodity dependence. In general, the Russian stock market is still characterized as emerging, and the latest trend of the market movement has been negative. In this regard, the question of proper equity premium forecasting of Russia is very important, because this may stimulate an investors\u2019 expected return growth and raise the investment activity in the market as a whole.\nAfter reviewing the economic literature concerning the stock market forecasting, we can conclude that there are many approaches and studies of this issue. There are two main opposing viewpoints, one of them says that there are certain indicators that predict the future stock market return under certain conditions. The opposite opinion states that the stock market prices are already adjusted for all currently available information, therefore the future stock price is unpredictable.\nRegarding the Russian stock market, most of the authors conclude that the impact of oil prices on the Russian stock market performance is weak and not regular. Moreover, some authors find the oil price is not a significant predictor after 2006. Many authors also prove the dependence of the Russian stock market on foreign exchanges, such as the U.S. or Germany.\nSo far the most common method that has been used to test stock return predictability is the linear regression, estimated by OLS. Therefore, this was the approach used in our study. We analyzed data on Russian stock market over the period from 31.01.2008 to 31.01.2017 in the in-sample analysis, we examined 9 industry indices of Russia, and 8 macroeconomic indicators as predictors. We found 3 out of 9 industries, and 5 out of 8 macroeconomic indicators are significant predictors. Among the significant predictors, all (with the exception of oil prices in USD) have a positive impact on the MICEX.\nHowever, through the out-of-sample analysis (the last three observed years), we found that all models, based on significant predictors, have larger MSFE than the\nIn our study, we also evaluated the utility gains of using the predictive models for a mean-variance investor. We calculated the difference between the average utility obtained by the investor who makes a decision based on the predictive model and the historical average model. We found positive utility gains for 2 out of 9 models (based on, the chemicals industry and the dividend yield).\nOur results are partly caused by the difficulty of stock market forecasting, in general, and by the problems inherent in the Russian stock market (described in section 3). Due to the lack of available data, we were forced to analyze a small time period in this study (our full sample is 10 years long, against the 20 years of the full sample and 10 out-of-sample in most of the other studies). Therefore, the lack of data, as well as the high market volatility and uncertainty associated with political and economic shocks may be partly responsible for the lack of predictive ability that we found in the out-ofsample period.\nThus, we plan to improve this study further in the future by applying other approaches of stock market prediction, as well as by expanding the range of predictive indicators.\nCampbell, J.
