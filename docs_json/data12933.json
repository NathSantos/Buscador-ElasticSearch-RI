O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npar\u00e2metros opcionais para o processo de cura com carbonata\u00e7\u00e3o acelerada, identificar as \n\nprincipais fases hidratadas da matriz de cimento e a durabilidade do fibrocimento refor\u00e7ado \n\ncom polpa celulosica. As mat\u00e9rias-primas utilizadas para as formula\u00e7\u00f5es dos comp\u00f3sitos \n\nciment\u00edcios usados nesta investiga\u00e7\u00e3o incluem: cimento Portland, adi\u00e7\u00e3o mineral (calc\u00e1rio ou \n\ns\u00edlica) e refor\u00e7o de fibra natural (Eucalipto ou Pinus). Os comp\u00f3sitos ciment\u00edcios foram \n\nproduzidas por um processo de suc\u00e7\u00e3o a v\u00e1cuo da mistura e posterior prensagem em pequena \n\nescala em laborat\u00f3rio. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es de cura foram conduzidas em v\u00e1rios conjuntos de amostras, \n\nque estudaram o efeito da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o da carbonata\u00e7\u00e3o acelerada (0%, 20% e \n\naproximadamente de 100% de CO2); o efeito de polpa celul\u00f3sica (n\u00e3o branqueada e \n\nbranqueada); o efeito da adi\u00e7\u00e3o mineral (Calc\u00e1rio e S\u00edlica) e, o efeito da durabilidade com o \n\nensaio de envelhecimento acelerado (200 ciclos de imers\u00e3o e secagem). Utilizou-se uma \n\nvariedade de m\u00e9todos de an\u00e1lise para avaliar a cin\u00e9tica de hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o, as propriedades \n\nmec\u00e2nicas e f\u00edsicas e as implica\u00e7\u00f5es qu\u00edmicas nos comp\u00f3sitos; entre eles: difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X \n\n(DRX), an\u00e1lise termogravim\u00e9trica (TG e DTG), espectroscopia de infravermelho (FTIR), \n\nmicroscopia electr\u00f4nica de varredura (MEV) e \u00e1rea superficial espec\u00edfica B.E.T.

Ap\u00f3s o envelhecimento acelerado, os comp\u00f3sitos com s\u00edlica sujeitos a dois \n\nregimes de cura diferentes (carbonatados e n\u00e3o carbonatados) n\u00e3o apresentam redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nestat\u00edstica do desempenho mec\u00e2nico, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o da energia especifica; tamb\u00e9m h\u00e1 aus\u00eancia \n\nde ettringite (AFt) no padr\u00e3o XRD.

However, further studies on the carbonation mechanism in natural fiber \n\nreinforced cement composite, knowledge about the choice of cellulose fiber, carbonation \n\nchamber parameters, the age at which to begin the carbonation curing, the influence of mineral \n\naddition and the amount of the main hydrated clinker phases before and after of accelerated \n\naging cycles, and durability test are still needed. The aim of this work was to evaluate the \n\ndefinition of optional parameters for accelerated carbonation curing process, the main hydrated \n\nphases of the cement matrix and the durability of fiber-cement reinforced with cellulose pulp. \n\nThe raw materials used for the cementitious composite mix designs used in this investigation \n\ninclude: Portland cement, filler (limestone or silica) and natural fiber reinforcement (eucalyptus \n\nor pines). The cementitious composites were produced by a slurry vacuum dewatering process \n\nfollowed by pressing in laboratory small scale. The curing conditions were conducted on \n\nvarious sets of samples which were studied the effect of accelerated carbonation concentration \n\n(0%, 20% and close of 100% of CO2); the effect of cellulosic pulp (unbleached or bleached); \n\nthe filler effect (limestone and silica); and, the effect of accelerated ageing test (200 soak &amp; dry \n\ncycles). A variety of analytical test methods were used to assess the hydration kinetics, the \n\nmechanical and the physical properties, and chemical implications in the composites; between \n\nthem: (X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG and DTG), Infrared \n\nspectrometer (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and B.E.T. surface area analyzer. \n\nOn the samples subject to close 100% of CO2 the results indicate that the bleached pulp \n\nreinforcement composites show in flexural test average statistically significant higher values of \n\nmodulus rupture and specific energy around 24 % relating with unbleached pulp. On the \n\nsamples subject to 20% CO2 the silica composite resulted in flexural test average statistically \n\nsignificant higher values of Limit of proportionality around 46% comparing with the limestone \n\ncomposite; the composite with silica addition presents less amount of calcium hydroxide (CH) \n\nin comparison with the composite with limestone addition, based on the CH residue detected in \n\nthe XRD analysis: 3% and 11.5% respectively. After accelerated aging, the silica composites \n\n\n\nsubject to two different curing regimes (carbonated and uncarbonated) presents no statistical \n\nreduction of mechanical performance, also there is an absence of ettringite (AFt) at XRD \n\npattern; nevertheless, the carbonated composites present a significantly higher average MOR \n\nvalues. Thus, it is concluded in this study that for cementitious composites cured with \n\naccelerated carbonation the use of bleached pulp with silica as mineral addition is indicated. \n\n \n\nKeywords: bleached pulp, unbleached pulp, silica, cement matrix, aging cycles, mechanical \n\nbehavior, microstructure.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nABBREVIATIONS LIST   \n\n \n\nAft Ettringite \n\nASTM  American Society for Testing and Materials \n\nB.E.T.

INTRODUCTION \n\nPresently, the building materials industry is looking for eco-friendly alternatives to supply the \n\nincreasing construction demand, not only in developing regions but all around the world \n\n(SAVASTANO et al., 2005). These studies indicate that natural resource based alternative \n\nmaterials should have a low production cost and minimal pollutant emissions, they should also \n\nbe durable while having the lowest possible impact on the environment (SAVASTANO et al., \n\n2005; TONOLI et al., 2010; ARDANUY et al., 2015). Significant advances have already made, \n\nbut more research and innovation are needed to find an ideal material that fits actual market \n\nrequirements including environmental and accessibility concerns. \n\nThe fiber-cement industry is particularly interested in the use of Natural waste fibers, including \n\nwood fibers. These are intriguing potential alternative materials, especially due to the extensive \n\npresence of plantations for these natural fibers (i.e. eucalyptus) reported in Brazil (ARDANUY \n\net al., 2015); these materials exhibit a set of important advantages, such as wide availability at \n\nrelatively low cost, biodegradability, and interesting physical and mechanical properties (low \n\ndensity and well-balanced stiffness). However, the low durability caused by degradation when \n\nexposed to an alkaline-mineral environment, has been an issue for fibers being used as \n\nreinforcement in various composites, like cementitious ones (ARDANUY et al., 2015; \n\nPICAN\u00c7O et al., 2008). \n\nThe literature indicates that the process of carbonation can result in a number of benefits, such \n\nas improved durability, reduced alkalinity of the cement matrix, reduced open porosity percent, \n\nvolume stabilization of the composite when exposed to humidity oscillation and strain gain. \n\nThere are two categorized groups of carbonation processes: carbonation of mature cementitious \n\nmatrices and carbonation of fresh cementitious composites. The first one is a phenomenon in \n\nwhich well-developed hydration products react with atmospheric CO2 through prolonged \n\nexposure, whereas in the second case carbonation is intentionally applied to fresh cement paste \n\nwherein CO2 reacts with the anhydrous phases and hydration products to form carbonates \n\n(FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004; ROSTAMI et al., 2012). The accelerated curing process, \n\nwhen applied to the cementitious matrix, results in an initial reaction between hydration \n\nproducts (e.g. calcium hydroxide and C-S-H), anhydrous phases (e.g. C3S and C2S) and carbon \n\ndioxide in order to produce stronger composites (e.g. calcium carbonate) (FERNANDEZ-\n\nBERTOS et al., 2004; SANTOS et al., 2015). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nIn natural fiber-cement, the curing process by accelerated carbonation has been identified as an \n\neffective procedure to mitigate the degradation of cellulose fibers, by improving mechanical \n\nbehavior and volumetric stabilization of these composites. Furthermore, the carbonation \n\nprocess on cementitious composites leads to: decreased alkalinity of the cement matrix due to \n\na lower content of Ca(OH)2, pore refinement, associated with the densification of the matrix \n\nthrough precipitation of CaCO3, which is a denser and more stable product than Ca(OH)2 \n\n(PIZZOL et al., 2014; ALMEIDA et al., 2013, TONOLI et al., 2010). Previous studies on \n\ncarbonation curing process in fiber-cement have highlighted that the relative humidity inside \n\nthe CO2 chamber must be high and in proximity to 90% to allow the diffusivity of CO2 in the \n\nbulk (HOUST, 1996).  The effectiveness of the accelerated carbonation curing process in \n\nnatural fiber-cement composites is affected by factors like the selection of the cellulosic pulp, \n\nthe chamber parameters, and the mineral addition.    \n\nA variety of carbonation curing conditions for cementing materials and also fiber composites \n\nhave been reported in the literature, but typically ranging from 2 to 20% CO2 concentration \n\nwith a wide range of combinations of pressure and temperature (LIWU et al., 2012). For \n\nexample, Almeida et al. (2013) have studied carbonated cement based specimens reinforced \n\nwith bleached eucalyptus pulp, the settings of climate chamber were 60\u00b0C temperature, 90% \n\nrelative humidity (RH) and atmospheric CO2 concentration (15 vol%) for two days.  Pizzol et \n\nal. (2014) have studied the accelerated carbonation process in cement based specimens \n\nreinforced with bleached cellulosic pulp and synthetic fibers, the settings of climate chamber \n\nwere 60\u00b0C temperature, 90% relative humidity (RH) and atmospheric CO2 concentration (15 \n\nvol%) for ten hours. Santos et al., (2015) have studied the supercritical carbonation on extruded \n\nfibre-cement reinforced with bleached eucalyptus pulp and residual sisal chopped fibres, the \n\nspecimens were placed into the chamber with total saturation (close of 100% concentration) of \n\nsupercritical CO2 at 20 MPa and at 45\u00b0C in the chamber. \n\nLimestone is normally used in the industry as a mineral addition in cementitious matrices in \n\norder to reduce costs concerning the production of fiber-cement (BENTUR et al., 2007). Also, \n\nlimestone was selected as mineral addition in the carbonated composites studied by Almeida et \n\nal. (2013), Pizzol et al. (2014) and Santos et al. (2015). Calcium carbonate filler (limestone), \n\nwhich even if inert materials blended with cement may have a significant effect on the hydration \n\nof the clinker phases (GUTTERIDGE et al., 1990), one those effects is the precipitation of \n\nCaCO3 (LOTHENBACH et al., 2008).  In addition, calcium carbonate is the principal reaction \n\nproduct of accelerated carbonation curing process at freshly cast cement, which could make \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\ndifficult analyze the quantification calcium carbonate formed along the accelerated carbonation \n\ncuring process.  \n\nSilica quartz is a neutral material, chemically and thermodynamically very stable at low \n\ntemperatures (e.g. 45\u00b0C) and atmospheric pressure (FOURNIER AND ROWE, 1977; SINGH \n\net al., 2013). Furthermore, the quartz used as filler does not react significantly and is nominally \n\ninert material, and gives more space for hydration product of the PC so the acceleration period \n\nis prolonged (LOPEZ, 2009; THOMAS et al., 2011). The use of quartz as the mineral addition \n\nin carbonated cementitious composites could be a strategy for isolating the carbonation process, \n\nin order to identify and estimate the amount of the main crystalline phases before and after of \n\naccelerated aging cycles.  \n\nThis introduction leaves clear that further studies on the carbonation mechanism in natural fiber \n\nreinforced cement composite, the choice of cellulose fiber, the mineral addition effect, the \n\nkinetic of hydration, the age at which to begin the carbonation curing, carbonation chamber \n\nparameters, and durability test are still needed.  \n\n \n\n1.2. General objective  \n\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate curing parameters for accelerated carbonation process, \n\nthe mineral addition effect, the main hydrated phases of the cement matrix and durability of \n\nfiber-cement reinforced with cellulose pulp, in order to apply this technology to building \n\nmaterials industry. \n\n1.3. Specifics objectives  \n\n1. Study of the definition of optimal parameters for supercritical carbonation process of \n\nvegetable fiber-cement composites at a very early age \n\n2. Comparative study of two kinds of mineral addition in cellulose pulp fiber-cement \n\ncomposites subjected to accelerated carbonation at early age. \n\n3. Durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-cement composites using \n\nsilica as a mineral addition. \n\n4. Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-cement \n\ncomposites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n1.4. Description of the thesis  \n\nThis study was development along five stages, follow describe: \n\nStage 1: Literature review  \n\nThis stage describes the natural fiber-cement reinforcement, the structure of vegetable fibers, \n\nthe cellulosic fibers, the fiber-cement production, the properties of cementitious materials \n\nreinforced with natural fibers, the durability, and finally introduces the fiber-cement curing with \n\ntwo processes: CO2 atmospheric curing process and atmospheric curing process.  \n\nStage 2: Definition of optimal parameters for supercritical carbonation process of \n\nvegetable fiber-cement composites at a very early age \n\nIn vegetal fiber-cement, the curing process by accelerated carbonation has been identified as an \n\neffective procedure to mitigate the degradation of cellulose fibers, by reducing the pH of the \n\nbulk matrix and improving mechanical behavior and volumetric stabilization of these \n\ncomposites. Furthermore, the carbonation process on cementitious composites leads to: a \n\ndecreased alkalinity of the cement matrix due to a lower content of Ca(OH)2, pore refinement, \n\nreduction to the average pore size, associated with the increased densification of the matrix \n\nthrough precipitation of CaCO3, which is a denser and more stable product than Ca(OH)2 \n\n(PIZZOL et al., 2014; ALMEIDA et al., 2013, TONOLI et al., 2010). Previous studies on \n\ncarbonation curing process in fiber-cements have highlighted that the relative humidity inside \n\nthe CO2 chamber must be high and in proximity to 90% to allow the diffusivity of CO2 in the \n\nbulk (HOUST, 1996).   \n\nThe concentrations of CO2 influence the carbonation rate of cement composites. Carbonation \n\nreaction could be slow with atmospheric CO2 concentration levels (0.03%\u2013 0.04%), while in \n\naccelerated curing, the concentration of CO2 in a chamber is typically 2%\u201320% and if \n\nsupercritical CO2 methods are used there is a greatly accelerated curing process with \n\nconcentrations close to 100%. In natural conditions, complete carbonation of engineering-sized \n\ncomponents takes years instead of hours in laboratory conditions. In general, increasing CO2 \n\nconcentration and pressure facilitates diffusion processes and the dissolution of CO2, thus high-\n\ndensity scCO2 eases the penetration into the cement paste pore network or complex pores \n\ntypical for fiber\u2013cement matrices (SANTOS et al., 2015; GARC\u00cdA et al., 2006; CHANG et al., \n\n2006; FARAHI et al., 2013; LIWU et al., 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nThe aim of the aim of the stage 2 is to study the influence of: the bleaching of eucalyptus \n\ncellulose pulp, the initial curing duration, the CO2 exposure time and accelerated aging cycles, \n\non natural fiber-cement composites subjected to supercritical carbonation at a very early age.  \n\nAll samples of the composites were subjected to mechanical, physical, and microstructural tests. \n\n \n\nStage 3: Comparative study of two kinds of mineral addition in cellulose pulp fiber-\n\ncement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at early age. \n\nLimestone is normally used in the industry as a mineral addition in cementitious matrices in \n\norder to reduce costs concerning the production of fiber-cement (BENTUR et al., 2007). Also, \n\nlimestone was selected as mineral addition in the carbonated cementitious composites studied \n\nby Almeida et al., (2013); Pizzol et al., (2014) and Santos et al., (2015). The use of limestone \n\nwith Portland Cement PC, it is being reported the high affinity between calcium aluminate and \n\ncarbonate phases to form monocarbonate. Also, at the initial hydration heat evolution indicating \n\na slight acceleration of the cement hydration in the presence of finely ground calcite \n\n(FELDMAN et al., 1965; BENSTED, 1980; LOTHENBACH et al., 2008). Silica quartz type \n\nis a neutral material, chemically and thermodynamically stable at low temperatures (e.g. 45\u00b0C) \n\nand atmospheric pressure (FOURNIER AND ROWE, 1977; SINGH et al., 2013). \n\nAdditionally, the quartz used as filler in a mix design with PC, it does not react significantly, is \n\nan inert material due the crystalline characteristic and gives more space to the particle \n\ndistribution for hydration product of the PC so the acceleration period is prolonged, compare \n\nwith 100% PC after mixing (LOPEZ, 2009; THOMAS et al., 2011). The use of quartz as \n\nmineral addition in carbonated cementitious composites could be a strategy for isolating the \n\ncarbonation process, in order to identify and estimate the amount of the main crystalline phases.  \n\nIn addition, calcium carbonate is the principal reaction product of accelerated carbonation \n\ncuring process at freshly cast cement, which could make difficult to analyze and quantify the \n\ncalcium carbonate formed along the accelerated carbonation curing process. \n\nCarbonated natural fiber-cement composites using two kinds of mineral addition could have \n\ndifferent: (i) mechanical behaviour, (ii) microstructure and (iii) amount of phases. The aim of \n\nthe stage 3 is compare two kind of mineral addition (limestone v. ground silica) and the initial \n\ncuring duration (10 h v. 24 h), on natural fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated \n\ncarbonation curing process at a very early age.  All samples of the composites were subjected \n\nto mechanical, physical, and microstructural tests.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\nStage 4: Durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-cement composites \n\nusing silica as a mineral addition. \n\nWorldwide cellulose fibers are extensively available, have many varieties and also are a \n\nrenewable source, which makes for an attractive concept to be used in composite building \n\nmaterials. The mechanical performance of these composites at early ages was deemed to be \n\nsatisfactory, however, in the presence of moisture and alkalinity above (pH 8.5), the wood fibres \n\nswell, and chemically degrade as a result of mineralization processes which in turn adversely \n\naffects the mechanical properties, namely strength and stiffness of the composite matrix. As \n\nwell it is affected the long-term performance after natural or accelerated ageing (e.g. wet/ dry \n\ncycling); it is adverse for the strength and toughness of the composite (MOHR et al., 2005; \n\nMOHR et al., 2007; BENTUR et al., 2007; TONOLI et al., 2009; DAI et al., 2014).   \n\nIn Natural Fiber-cement, the curing process by accelerated carbonation has been identified as \n\nan effective procedure to mitigate the long-term degradation of cellulose fibers, by reducing the \n\npH of the bulk matrix and improving mechanical behavior and volumetric stabilization of these \n\ncomposites. Furthermore, the carbonation process on cementitious composites leads to a \n\ndecreased alkalinity of the cement matrix due to a lower content of Ca(OH)2, pore refinement, \n\nreduction to the average pore size, associated with the increased densification of the matrix \n\nthrough precipitation of CaCO3, which is a denser and more stable product than Ca(OH)2 \n\n(PIZZOL et al., 2014; ALMEIDA et al., 2013, TONOLI et al., 2010). \n\nFast carbonation curing is beneficial for accelerating the plastic shrinkage of the composite, and \n\navoiding dimensional instability of the composite in the initial ages and during the lifetime. \n\nThese studies also show the improvement of mechanical properties after the Accelerated Aging \n\nCycles, as an evidence that the cement matrix improves its performance with the carbonation \n\ncuring process at early ages and with the progress of the cement hydration process (ALMEIDA \n\net al., 2013). \n\nAs was previously mentioned at stage three silica quartz type is a neutral material, chemically \n\nand thermodynamically stable at low temperatures (e.g. 45\u00b0C) and atmospheric pressure \n\n(FOURNIER AND ROWE, 1977; SINGH et al., 2013). Additionally, the quartz used as filler \n\nin a mix design with OPC, it does not react significantly, is an inert material; due the crystalline \n\ncharacteristic of the quartz, so gives more space to the particle distribution for hydration product \n\nof the OPC so the acceleration period is prolonged, if it is compared with a mix with 100% \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nPortland cement (LOPEZ, 2009; THOMAS et al., 2011). The use of quartz as a mineral addition \n\nin carbonated cementitious composites could be a strategy for isolating the carbonation process, \n\nin order to identify and estimate the amount of the main crystalline phases before and after of \n\naccelerated aging cycles. Also, for know about the mechanical properties after the Accelerated \n\nAging Cycles. \n\nThe use of quartz as a mineral addition in carbonated cementitious composites could be a \n\nstrategy for isolating the carbonation process, in order to identify and estimate the amount of \n\nthe main crystalline phases before and after of accelerated aging cycles. Also, the use of silica \n\nas a mineral addition in carbonate fiber-cement composite there is not knowledge about the \n\nmechanical properties behaviour after the Accelerated Aging Cycles. \n\nThe use of silica as a mineral addition in carbonated composites could allow discussing in this \n\nstage: (i) the effect of initial hydration; (ii) the identification of the main phases; (iii) the \n\ncarbonation effect and (iv) the durability. The aim of stage four is to study the durability and \n\nthe hydration kinetics in carbonated composites reinforced with unbleached pines cellulose pulp \n\nfiber and use silica as a mineral addition. Composites were subjected to mechanical, physical, \n\nand microstructural tests. \n\n \n\nStage 5: Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-cement \n\ncomposites subjected to accelerated carbonation at early age \n\nAs was mentioned in stage 3 and stage 4, Limestone is normally used in the industry as a mineral \n\naddition in cementitious matrices in order to reduce costs concerning the production of fiber-\n\ncement (BENTUR et al., 2007). Also, limestone was selected as the mineral addition in the \n\ncarbonated cementitious composites studied by Almeida et al. (2013), Pizzol et al. (2014) and \n\nSantos et al. (2015). According with Tonoli et al. (2016), the main phases identified in the X-\n\nray diffraction patterns of the control uncarbonated and carbonated cementitious composites \n\nare: calcite (CaCO3); vaterite (Va); aragonite (Ar); monosulfoaluminate (AFm); ettringite (Aft); \n\nportlandite (P); monocarboaluminate (Mc); tricalcium aluminate (C3A); tetracalcium \n\naluminoferrite (C4AF); belite (C2S) and alite (C3S). \n\nPreviously mentioned, silica quartz type is a neutral material, chemically and \n\nthermodynamically very stable at low temperatures (e.g. 45\u00b0C) and at atmospheric pressure \n\n(FOURNIER AND ROWE, 1977; SINGH et al., 2013). The use of silica type quartz as a \n\nmineral addition in carbonated cementitious composites could be a strategy for isolating the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\ncarbonation process, in order to identify the main crystalline phases along the 10 h carbonation \n\nprocess and to study the carbonation kinetic hydration at early edge.  \n\nThe use of silica as a mineral addition in carbonated composites could allow discussing \n\nfollowing subjects: (i) the carbonation kinetic hydration along 10 h; (ii) the identification of the \n\nmain phases and (iii) the microstructure at early edges. The aim of stage 5 is to study the kinetic \n\nhydration in carbonated at early edge unbleached pines cellulose pulp fiber-cement composites \n\nthat use silica as a mineral addition. For looking into the kinetic hydration, for each condition \n\ntwo samples were removed from the chamber each hour running the carbonation curing process. \n\nThen the samples were immersed in acetone, in order to interrupt the hydration of the \n\ncementitious matrix. Also, a small piece of the sample was cut for adding the phenolphthalein \n\nindicator and checking the status of the internal surface, according to the intensity of the color \n\ndisplayed by the indicator.  All samples of the composites were subjected to microstructural \n\ntests. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nAs previously mentioned in section 1.4. this stage makes an introduction of the natural fiber-\n\ncement reinforcement, the structure of vegetable fibers, the cellulosic fibers, the fiber-cement \n\nproduction, the properties of cementitious materials reinforced with natural fibers and the \n\ndurability, finally introduce the fiber-cement curing process with two processes: CO2 \n\natmospheric curing process and atmospheric curing process. The first one curing process \n\nmentioned was considered a treatment to improve the mechanical properties of this kind of \n\ncomposites, even through many variables or factors could be affected the effectiveness of this \n\ntreatment.  \n\n2.2. Natural Fiber-cement reinforcement  \n\nSince the early 1940s, many studies have investigated the concept of vegetal fiber reinforcement \n\nin cement-based materials as a potential substitute for asbestos fibers. Since then, the potential \n\napplications of VF cement composites have grown, especially with regards to thin walled \n\nmaterials: mainly thin-sheet products for partitions, building envelopes or ceiling flat sheets; \n\nroofing tiles and premanufactured components in general (ROMA et al., 2008). Other reasons \n\nfor the increased interest in vegetable fiber integration with building materials, include their \n\ndecreasing pressures for the dependence on the building materials industry to use petroleum \n\nbased products (e.g. synthetic fibers), with increasing interest in the use of renewable resources \n\n(e.g. cellulosic fibers), and variety of morphologies and aspect ratios (PICAN\u00c7O et al., 2008; \n\nSATYANARAYANA et al., 2009; TONOLI et al., 2009).  \n\nAccording to regional statistical yearbooks of 2014 from the Food and Agriculture Organization \n\nof the United Nations (FAO) (FAO Statistical Yearbooks \u2013 World food and agriculture 2014), \n\nthe land and forestry report in 2011 estimates forest and fibers areas to be 517.3 million ha and \n\n1.7 ha, respectively.

Structure of vegetable fibers \n\nCellulose is the most abundant and biodegradable natural polymer that exists on planet earth, it \n\nis the principal fiber reinforcement of wood, non-wood plants, seaweeds and some bacteria \n\n(LAVOINE et al., 2012). The structure of an individual wood cell is composed mainly of long, \n\noriented cellulose molecules, with a degree of polymerization of ?25,000. The cellulose \n\nmolecule chains are grouped in long, oriented microfibril units having a thickness of about 0.7 \n\nmm and a length of a few ?m. The other components of the cell wall, hemicellulose, and lignin, \n\nhave much lower degrees of polymerization and are located mainly in the middle lamellae \n\nwhich connects the individual fiber cells together (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; \n\nCORREIA, 2015). \n\nFour different polymorphs of cellulose are known, named cellulose I, II, III, and IV. Cellulose \n\nI is the form found in nature and it occurs in two allomorphs I? and I?. Cellulose II is the \n\ncrystalline form more stable and also emerges after re-crystallization with aqueous sodium \n\nhydroxide, and it is the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form. Cellulose II and \n\ncellulose I have antiparallel and parallel packing, respectively. Cellulose III is obtained by a \n\nliquid ammonia treatment of cellulose I, and cellulose IV is a result of heating cellulose III, the \n\ntransformation usually being only partial (AULIN, 2009; CORREIA, 2015).  Figure 1 shows \n\nhow cellulose is present in nature. Inattentive of its source, cellulose is a white fiber-like \n\nstructure with no smell and has a density of around 1.5 g/cm\u00b3 (LAVOINE et al., 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Details of the cellulosic fiber structure with emphasis on the cellulose microfibrils \n\n(in color).  \n\n \n\nSource: (LAVOINE et al., 2012). \n\nThe sorption isotherm of cellulosic material depends on the purity of cellulose and the degree \n\nof crystallinity. There are many hydroxyl (OH) groups in cellulose, which in amorphous phase \n\nare accessible to water and available for interaction. They interact with water not only at the \n\nsurface but also in the bulk. But, there are significant problems of compatibility between the \n\nfiber and cementitious composite, which weakens interface areas between natural fibers and \n\nmatrices (THOMAS et al., 2011; SHALWAN et al., 2013). TONOLI et al., 2009 reported that \n\nwith a proper alkaline treatment, cement composites with vegetable fibers previously submitted \n\nto surface modification with methacryloxypropyltri-methoxysilane (MPTS) show fibers free \n\nfrom cement hydration products, reducing their hydrophilic character and improving their \n\nadhesion. \n\nThe diminution of the moisture absorption and the surface modification of fibers may also \n\nincrease tensile properties of the fibers and also the strength properties of biodegradable \n\ncomposites, keeping in mind the composition and structure of lignocellulosic fibers. In \n\nconsidering the applicability of cellulose fibers to cement reinforcement, lignin is an amorphous \n\nchemical species susceptible to dissolution in an alkaline medium such as a cement matrix \n\n(COUTTS et al., 2005; AGOPYAN et al., 2005; TONOLI et al., 2009; SATYANARAYANA \n\net al., 2009). \n\nLignin and hemicellulose have one characteristic in common: sensitivity to the alkaline \n\nenvironment, which means that they easily undergo the alkaline hydrolysis of cellulose \n\nmolecules in the highly alkaline cementitious matrix due to the high calcium hydroxide content. \n\nFor increasing the durability of vegetable fibers, it is research through modifying the fibers with \n\nimpregnation, treatments, and fibrillation; to minimize the degradation at fiber-cement \n\ncomposites during wetting and drying cycles.

They are classified by their length and form: macroscopic level \n\n(normally 0.1\u20131 m), mesoscopic level (normally 1\u201310 mm), microscopic level (normally 0.01\u2013\n\n6 mm) and ultrastructural level (normally 1\u201325 \u00b5m) (ARDANUY et al., 2015; DAI et al., 2014). \n\nAt the microscopic level, two kinds of wood cells have different hierarchical structures: \n\nsoftwood fibers (pines, firs, etc.) and hardwood fibers (the birch tree, eucalyptus, beech, etc.). \n\nBoth kinds of fibers are non-hazardous, renewable and widely available. The differences \n\nbetween softwood and hardwood fibers are the high price of the former and the faster growing \n\nplantations of the latter in tropical countries. The VF in previous decades received the attention \n\nto be used as replacement for hazardous asbestos fibers. The VF is a reinforcing material that \n\ntoday is found in products such as extruded non-pressure pipes and non-structural building \n\nmaterials, mainly thin-sheet products (MOHR et al., 2005; PIZZOL, 2013; DAI et al., 2014; \n\nARDANUY et al., 2015). \n\nAt the ultrastructural level, the wood fibers are built up of four layers.  These are M (middle \n\nlamella), the P (primary cell wall) containing cellulose microfibrils, the S (secondary wall) and \n\nW (warty layer). The secondary wall is composed of three separate and distant layers \u2013 S1 (outer \n\nlayer of the secondary wall), S2 (middle layer of the secondary wall) and S3 (inner layer of the \n\nsecondary wall). S2 layer is the thickest and the most important in determining mechanical \n\nproperties (THOMAS et al., 2011; DAI et al., 2014). Inside microfibril containing regions, \n\nnetworks contain organized structure (crystalline) and loose structure (amorphous). At \n\ncrystalline regions, the network interactions and molecular orientations could change, given \n\norigin to polymorph and allomorph (CORREIA, 2015). \n\nCellulosic fibers provide adequate stiffness, strength and bonding capacity to cement-based \n\nmatrices, so they have been extensively applied as the sole reinforcing element in commercial \n\nautoclaved and air-cured Portland cement products, because of the retention of cellulose fibers \n\nparticles on the Hatschek process (CORREIA et al., 2014; WEI et al., 2015).  \n\nhttp://www.linguee.com/english-spanish/translation/amorphous.html\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Fiber-cement production \n\nThe current worldwide production cellulosic Fiber-cement, in conjunction with polyvinyl \n\nalcohol (PVA) fibers for air-cured (non-autoclaved) products, is located in United States of \n\nAmerica, Europe, Oceania and Asia. Brazil has 17 cement plants in ten Brazilian states, offering \n\nfive thousand jobs and producing 1.3 million tons per year (PIZZOL, 2013).  \n\nThe Hatschek process was patented by Hatschek in 1900. It consists of producing fiber cement \n\nsheets by stacking thin laminas made from a suspension of cement, fibers, mineral admixtures \n\nand water, in a process that resembles the production of paper. The first step of the process is \n\npreparing the slurry, the mixture of adequate proportions of solid materials (i.e. water, cement, \n\ncellulose fibers, and limestone filler) by a roller from a tank under continuous agitation. The \n\nslurry is then transported to the vats with sieve cylinders where wet solid material is deposited \n\nand then removing, thus, forming a green lamina. Using a vacuum system, a significant portion \n\nof the mixing water is removed from the slurry, forming a very thin sheet (about 1 mm). Finally, \n\nthe fresh sheet is cut, shaped (corrugated sheets and accessories) and submitted to curing under \n\nair or steam conditions -autoclave-. Hatschek machines were designed to produce homogeneous \n\nmaterials, so these processes produce composites with an adequate percentage of fibers well \n\ndispersed into the matrix (DIAS et al., 2010; ARDANUY et al., 2015). \n\nFigure 2 - Schematic drawing of a typical Hatschek process. In this figure F is the green sheet \n\nfiber cement and P is a final product. \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: (DIAS et al., 2010) \n\nAt laboratory scale, the specimens are made using a slurry-dewatering process followed by a \n\npressing technique, as a similar reproduction of the Hatschek process used in the industrial \n\nproduction of fiber cement (SAVASTANO et al., 2000). Figure 3 shows the Schematic drawing \n\nwith the respective stages. \n\nhttp://www.linguee.com/english-portuguese/translation/thousand.html\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Schematic drawing of slurry-dewatering process follow: a) Mix, b) slurry-\n\ndewatering c) pressing manual d) slurry-dewatering e) Pressing.  \n\n  \n\nSource: (DEVITO, 2003) \n\n  \n\n2.2.3. Properties of cementitious materials reinforced with vegetal fibers \n\nThe majority of studies about the mechanical behavior of specimens of cement composites \n\nprepared at laboratory analyze their mechanical properties using both the three-point and four-\n\npoint bending configurations. Those are employed to evaluate the limit of proportionality (LOP), \n\nmodulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE) and specific energy (SE). The standard TFR1 \n\nof RILEM recommends a proportion between the maximum distance between supports and the \n\nthickness of the specimen higher than 20 (TONOLI et al., 2013; ARDANUY et al., 2015).  \n\nThe tensile strength, void content and interfacial adhesion of the composite is influence by \n\noptimum fiber volume fraction of natural fibers and type of fiber. The effects of fiber content \n\non strength show a maximum in the range of 8\u201312% by mass. Comparing a composite with \n\nfiber compare without fibers, both subjected to mechanical stress, the crack is going to be \n\ngreater magnitude through is not reinforced by fibers. In Figure 4 shows schematic \n\nrepresentation composite flexural behavior: (a) without fibers, (b) with fiber reinforced (c) \n\ncrack detail through the reinforced composite fibers: (1) and (2) bridging and detachment of the \n\nfiber; (3) pullout fiber; (4) disruption of fiber (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; PIZZOL, \n\n2013; SHALWAN et al., 2013). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Schematic representation composite flexural behavior \n\n \n\nSource: (TONOLI et al., 2009). \n\nBeyond the optimum fiber content, the detrimental effect due to the porosity increase is greater \n\nthan the reinforcing influence of the added fiber. Porosity inside cement composite is influenced \n\nat the early edge by the curing process and by climatic conditions. The total initial porosity of \n\ncement paste depends on by relations between temperature, paste composition and mineralogy. \n\nThe amount of porosity could be increased by rising cure temperatures, the alteration, and \n\nsolubility of AFt, the evaporation of water excess and gasses from the outside into the inside of \n\nthe cement material. Furthermore, depending on weather, the pore network may be dry, semi-\n\nsaturated and saturated. This porosity is one of the causes of the lack of durability of the cement \n\npastes (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; MATSCHEI et al., 2010; ARDANUY et al., 2015).  \n\nCellulosic fiber-cement reinforcement presents a satisfactory mechanical performance at early \n\nages, but the wood fibers swell in the presence of moisture or water and high alkalinity of the \n\ncementitious matrix cause a chemical degradation and negatively influenced of stiffness and \n\nstrength (ARDANUY et al., 2015). \n\nAttempts have been made to optimize the properties of the composites by changing the fiber \n\ncontent and their quality, through modifications in the pulping process as well as by surface \n\ntreatments to enhance fiber\u2013matrix interactions. The evaluation of the reinforcing effects is \n\nusually determined by testing composites made in a full-scale Hatschek process or used a \n\nvariation of the process (the slurry vacuum de-watering technique) (BENTUR AND \n\nMINDESS, 2007; CORREIA et al., 2014; DAI et al., 2014). \n\n2.2.4. Durability  \n\nThe industrial production of cement-based composites reinforced with VF is currently limited \n\nby the long-term durability of these air-cured composites due to the deterioration caused by \n\nseveral mechanisms associated with the environment (i.e. natural weathering, sulphate or \n\nchloride attack, etc.) and inside the composite (i.e. alkali attack, fiber mineralization, and \n\nvolume variation). The following sequence of degradation occurs in the vegetable fibers when \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nthe composite is subjected to various wet/dry cycles: (a) loss of adherence between the fiber \n\nand the matrix; (b) reprecipitation of the hydrated compounds within the void space at the \n\nformer fiber\u2013cement interface; (c) full mineralization, and thus the embrittlement of the \n\nvegetable fibers. After the post-cracking, this causes the material to have a reduction in strength \n\nand toughness (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; PACHECO-TORGAL et al., 2011; \n\nALMEIDA et al., 2013; ARDANUY et al., 2015; WEI et al., 2015). \n\nThe swelling and shrinking of the fibers during wetting and drying, with strains greater than \n\nthose of the matrix, may lead to changes in the contact pressure across the interface, thus \n\ncausing variations in the actual bond. A proper fibre\u2013matrix interaction depends on the \n\navailability of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the cellulose are the prime means by which \n\nfibers and cement bond together, also influence the cellulose-pulp fiber failure. Improving the \n\nfibre-matrix bond too much will lead to the composite becoming too brittle and susceptible to \n\nmovement cracking in service (COUTTS AND KIGHTLY, 1984; COUTTS, 2005; BENTUR \n\nAND MINDESS, 2007). \n\nIn a highly alkaline cementitious matrix, the harsh hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and lignin \n\ncauses molecular chains to divide and decreases the degree of polymerization due to the greater \n\namount of calcium hydroxide, that reprecipitation is a dominant step in kraft pulp fiber-cement \n\ncomposite degradation during wet-dry cycling. The migration of alkaline hydration products to \n\nlumens and to the middle lamella, caused a volume variation in these fibers due their high-water \n\nabsorption, also produce fiber mineralization by be sensitive to the amount of CH in the matrix \n\n(BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; MOHR et al., 2007; WEI et al., 2015). \n\nMany authors have reported fiber mineralization as a source of degradation which leads to fiber \n\nembrittlement and the reduction of strength and strain capacity. The CH-mineralization is a \n\nmechanism of degradation of the fiber due to the CH content of the matrix and deleterious effect \n\nof Ca2+ elements. The degradation of cellulose can be simply generalized as the disconnection \n\nof discrete cellulose nanocrystals caused by decomposition of reducing ends (feature original \n\nC4- OH) in amorphous regions. The accelerated carbonation curing process is projected to \n\ndecrease the amount of calcium hydroxide in cement-based composites, as well as lower the \n\npH and porosity, and minimize the degradation of the fiber (SILVA, 2002; PACHECO-\n\nTORGAL et al., 2011; MOHR et al., 2007; WEI et al., 2015). \n\nSome researchers have revealed that the long term integrity of the vegetable fibre\u2013cement \n\ncomposite matrix may be compromised upon exposure to environmental conditions such as \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nmoisture (SAVASTANO et al., 1999; MOHR et al., 2007; TONOLI et al., 2009). One potential \n\nstrategy to reduce the vulnerability of vegetable fibre-cement composites to degradation over \n\nthe long term is to use fibre\u2013cement composed of Portland cement, finely ground crystalline \n\nsilica, and cellulose fibre which are autoclaved to a specified strength, durability and \n\ndimensional stability (COUTTS et al., 1995; COOKE et al., 2000). In addition to the autoclave \n\nprocess, carbonation curing of fresh cementitious composites is reported to also reduce the \n\nvulnerability of the degradation of cellulose fibres since carbonation reduces the pH of the bulk \n\nmatrix leading to less fibre degradation which is beneficial for the mechanical behaviour, \n\nmicrostructure and improves the plastic shrinkage (ALMEIDA et al., 2010; TONOLI et al., \n\n2010; PIZZOL et al., 2014; BERTOS et al., 2004; SANTOS et al., 2015). \n\n2.3.  Fiber-cement composites curing process    \n\n2.3.1. CO2 atmospheric curing process  \n\nCementitious composites are well known to be reactive with carbon dioxide. There are two \n\nways this carbonation reaction occurs: carbonation of mature cementitious matrices and \n\ncarbonation of fresh cementitious composites. The first one is a phenomenon in which well-\n\ndeveloped hydration products react with atmospheric CO2 through prolonged exposure and the \n\nsecond case carbonation is intentionally applied to freshly cement paste where in CO2 reacts \n\nwith the anhydrous phases to form strength contributing hydrates and carbonate (ALMEIDA et \n\nal., 2013; ROSTAMI et al., 2012).  \n\nComplete carbonation of engineering-sized components in natural conditions can take years \n\ninstead hours like a laboratory conditions, due concentrations of CO2 influence the carbonation \n\nrate of cement composites. Carbonation reaction could be slow with atmospheric CO2 \n\nconcentration (0.03%\u20130.04%), while in accelerated curing carbonation in a chamber is typically \n\nused 2%\u201320% concentration of CO2 and with supercritical CO2 is greatly accelerated curing \n\nprocess with rate close 100%. In general, increasing CO2 concentration and pressure ease \n\ndiffusion processes and the dissolution of CO2 (GARCIA-GONZALEZ et al., 2006; CHANG \n\net al., 2006; LIWU et al., 2012; FARAHI et al., 2013).  \n\nReinforced concrete has a highly alkaline medium (pH 13), to cement present; giving to steel a \n\npassive protection oxide film. On service is exposed to atmospheric carbon dioxide, CO2 \n\ndiffuses through the unsaturated pores. This reaction generates shrinkage, reduced sorptivity, \n\ndecreased water permeability and reduces the pH value in the environment of the reinforcement, \n\ninduced steel corrosion of steel reinforcing bars. Consequently, the oxidizing affected the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\ndurability of the structure (FERN\u00c1NDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004; PETER et al., 2008; \n\nROSTAMI et al., 2011; ROSTAMI et al., 2012).  \n\nCarbonation accelerated curing process at freshly cast cement paste, cured concrete and fiber \n\ncomposites, is extensive reported that shown to offer improved mechanical and durability \n\nproperties (PETER et al., 2008; ROSTAMI et al., 2012). Furthermore, in vegetal Fiber-cement \n\ncomposites submitted to an accelerated carbonation test has been identified as effective \n\nprocedure to mitigate the degradation of cellulose fibers and to improve mechanical behaviour \n\nand volumetric stabilization of these composites (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; SANTOS et al., \n\n2015).  \n\nTherefore, a minimum content of water is essential for the ionization of compounds to promote \n\nthe reaction of carbonation, but a large amount of water (i.e. saturated pores) limits the reaction \n\ndue to the blockage of the pores (ALMEIDA et al., 2013). Independent of the concentration of \n\nCO2 the chemical reaction is similar in that the carbon dioxide diffuses into the capillary pores \n\nof the cementitious composites and combines with aqueous phase in the pores, forming carbonic \n\nacid (H2CO3) that dissociates into carbonate (HCO3 and CO3). Once carbon dioxide dissolves \n\nreacts with hydration products, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) and calcium silicate hydrate \n\n(C\u2013S\u2013H), forming CaCO3 by the combination of moist CO2 with Ca\n2+ and silica gel, the follow \n\nequations shows the process (Eqs. (1)\u2013(2)) (FERN\u00c1NDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004; ROSTAMI \n\net al., 2012; ALMEIDA et al., 2013; FARAHI et al., 2013): \n\n \n\nCa (OH)2 + CO2 ? CaCO3 + H2O            (Eq.   1) \n\nC-S-H + 2CO2 ? SiO2 + 2CaCO3 + H2O    (Eq.   2) \n\n \n\nAnother way to explain the interaction between carbon dioxide and hydrated Portland cement \n\nat atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature conditions is through the Figure 5. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Diagram with principal mechanisms for accelerated carbonation in Portland \n\ncement. \n\n \n\nSource: SANTOS et al. 2015 and FERN\u00c1NDEZ-BERTOS et al. 2004. \n\nCarbonation of Ca(OH)2 into CaCO3 causes an increase of volume, depending on the crystal \n\nform, which is 3% for aragonite, 12% for calcite and 19% for vaterite. Calcite is the stable form \n\nunder normal temperature and pressure and is the principal kind of calcium carbonate formed \n\nby carbonation (HOUST, 1996).  \n\nAccelerated carbonation curing process model must consider the kinetic and thermodynamic \n\nparameters that influence the equilibrium of each phase and the interaction thereof. \n\nConsequently, the dissolution and precipitation of chemical compounds or ionic equilibrium \n\nwith carbonation process vary with the temperature, ionic strength and pH solution (TONOLI \n\net al., 2010; MATSUSHITA et al., 2004; CHEN et al., 2007; BULLARD et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n2.3.1.1. Influenced by the relative humidity on Carbonation reaction  \n\nThe diffusivity of gases in cementitious composites is influenced by the porosity, the cement \n\ncontent, the kinetic hydration, the water to cement ratio, etc. It was found that the effective \n\ndiffusivity of CO2 does not depend on the CO2 concentration. The effective diffusivity of carbon \n\ndioxide is a function of the relative humidity, this is due to the large reduction of the equilibrium \n\nwater content caused by carbonation. At the cementitious composite the porosity needs to \n\nconsists of micro- and meso-pores where water can adsorb and condense. Consequently, the \n\nporous volume allowing gas diffusion is reduced. In non-carbonated materials the influence of \n\nhumidity is much lower (HOUST, 1996). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nAccording to Fernandez-Bertos et al. 2004, the water content affects the reaction of CO2, \n\nbecause it is essential for the solvation and hydration of the carbon dioxide. It dissolves the Ca2+ \n\nions from the solid that will in turn react to form the CaCO3. Subsequently, it influences the \n\namount of product generated, which is also related to the development of strength. \n\nFor conventional concrete, it has been well reported that the occurrence of carbonation reactions \n\nis most likely between 40% and 80% relative humidity. Various researchers have used a range \n\nof 65% to 70% relative humidity in accelerated laboratory carbonation chambers for tests on \n\nconventional cement (CHANG et al., 2006; SISOMPHON et al., 2007; SULAPHA et al., 2003). \n\nHowever, accelerated carbonation chambers for cement-based materials containing reactive \n\nMgO are more effective at a higher relative humidity (i.e. 98%) (LIWU et al., 2012). On cement \n\npastes samples exposed to a highly carbonating environment with pure carbon dioxide at 90 % \n\nrelative humidity, was chosen as it has been observed that the hydration of the cement is very \n\nslow, but the carbonation rate is high at this humidity (HOUST, 1996; YLM\u00c9N et al., 2013; \n\nALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL et al., 2014).  \n\n2.3.2. Hydration of Portland cement curing process \n\nThe hydration of Portland cement consists of the reaction of its phases with water, through an \n\nexothermic reaction, which transform the cement fluid mix and water into a solid phase \n\n(PEREIRA, 2012). Chemical processes, the effect of curing conditions, equilibrium solubility, \n\nrate of dissolution, and other aspects involve understanding hydration process during the \n\ndifferent periods. A way to simplify the explanation, is to isolate and study the individual rate \n\nprocesses that govern cement hydration (BULLARD et al., 2011). \n\nC3S/alite constitutes between 50% and 80% of Portland cement and dominates the development \n\nof properties (SCRIVENER et al., 2011). So it is clear why many studies discuss the hydration \n\nof the Portland cement clinker, focusing on the three main periods of reaction of alite/C3S: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Up to the end of the induction period (about 3 h)  \n\n\u2022 Main heat evolution peak (approx. 3\u201324 h), including impact of mineral additions \n\n\u2022 Continuing reaction after 1 day (particularly from 1 to 28 days) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nThe induction period is characterized by fast reactions between C3S and water that starts \n\nimmediately upon wetting, characterized by a large exothermic signal in isothermal calorimetry \n\nexperiments (COSTOYA, 2008). There are many reasons why there is little growth of C-S-H \n\nthrough the induction period, like the degree of hydration at the end of the induction period is \n\nonly around 2\u20134%. As soon as the precipitation of product happens, the concentration of Ca in \n\nsolution increases, eventually up to around 35 to 40 ?mol, at the end of the induction period \n\n(BROWN et al., 1984). In parallel the concentration of silicate drops dramatically to the ?mol \n\nrange. Thus, the rate of dissolution of C3S becomes very slow as the solution is supersaturated \n\nwith respect to calcium hydroxide (SCRIVENER et al., 2015). \n\nAt the end of the induction period C\u2013S\u2013H and Portlandite begin to grow rapidily. Bazzoni et al. \n\n2014, propose that the kinetics along the principal heat evolution peak are controlled by the \n\ngrowth of C\u2013S\u2013H \u201cneedles\u201d. The needles nucleate on the surface of particles and, those properly \n\noriented, grow outwards. Thus, calcium hydroxide does not precipitate during the induction \n\nperiod, there are two possible mechanisms (BULLARD et al., 2010): either the presence of an \n\ninhibiting layer, or the \u201cgeochemical\u201d approach.  In addition, a modeling program HydratiCA \n\nshowed that in the second case an inhibition of the nucleation or growth of Portlandite (without \n\nimpacting the other reactions) would produce retardation (SCRIVENER et al., 2015).  \n\nThe hydration kinetics beyond one day include two relevant processes: first, from 1 to 6 days \n\nthe quantity of hydration seems to be principally determined by the water to cement ratio or the \n\nspace available for the cement hydrates. After about 6 days all the systems seem to have very \n\nsimilar kinetics. Second, the period 1\u201328 days is of great practical importance as 75% of the \n\ndesign strength may develop during this period. The heat evolution rate is very low after 28 \n\ndays of hydration process (SCRIVENER et al., 2011; SCRIVENER et al., 2015).  \n\nIsothermal conduction calorimetry (Figure 6) indicates the onset of the acceleration period at \n\napprox. 3h in PC (Portland cement without limestone addition) and PC4 (Portland cement with \n\nlimestone addition). The maximal heat evolution of the cement hydration was slight accelerated \n\nin the presence of finely ground calcite (PC4). Due to the nucleation and growth of hydration \n\nproducts (STARK, 2004; PERA et al., 1999). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Isothermal calorimetry of Portland cement without additional limestone PC (black \n\nlines) and blended with 4 wt.% limestone PC4 (grey lines) expressed as J/h/g unhydrated \n\ncement. \n\n \n\nSource: (LOTHENBACH et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nFigure 7 shows the rate of heat evolution as a function of the clinker phases for 3 systems: a \n\npure Portland system, a blend of the same Portland with 40% quartz (inert) and a blend with \n\n40% slag. For the first 28 h the curves for the blends with quartz and slag are essentially the \n\nsame, confirming that the reaction of slag itself is not occurring in this period. Nevertheless, \n\nwhen the rate of heat evolution is normalized relative to the clinker component (in this case) it \n\nis clear that the slag and quartz enhance the reaction of the clinker component due to their \n\nphysical presence; this is named the mineral addition effect (SCRIVENER et al., 2015). \n\nFigure 7 - Rate of heat evolution normalized to clinker content for a Portland cement and the \n\nsame cement substituted 40% by quartz or by slag. \n\n \n\nSource: (SCRIVENER et al., 2015). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4. Mineral addition effect  \n\nThe mineral addition effect can be attributed to two main aspects.  First, when supplementary \n\ncementitious material particles substitute Portland Cement particles, as illustrated in Figure 8, \n\nthere is comparatively more space available for the hydrates of the clinker phases to form in. \n\nSecondly, the surface of the SCM particles act as sites for the heterogeneous precipitation and \n\ngrowth of hydrates (SCRIVENER et al., 2015)..  \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Schematic of the particle distribution after mixing for a 100% Portland cement \n\nsystem at a water to cement ratio of 0.4 (left) and for the same system but with 40% of the \n\nclinker particles replaced by a mineral addition (right).  \n\n \n\nSource: (SCRIVENER et al., 2015). \n\n \n\nLimestone is normally used in the industry as a mineral addition in cementitious matrices in \n\norder to reduce costs concerning the production of fiber-cement (BENTUR AND MINDESS, \n\n2007). Also, the calcium carbonate mineral addition (limestone) is usually used in research of \n\ncement based specimens reinforced with eucalyptus cellulosic pulp subjected to accelerated \n\ncarbonation curing, in order to apply this technology for the production of fiber-cement at \n\nindustry (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; SANTOS et al., 2015; PIZZOL et al., 2014). But the mineral \n\naddition, even if it consists of inert materials blended with cement, may have a significant effect \n\non the hydration of the clinker phases (GUTTERIDGE et al., 1990).  \n\nVarious studies showed that the presence of limestone leads to the formation of monocarbonate \n\ndue to the reaction between the limestone carbonates and existing aluminates (FELDMAN et \n\nal., 1965; BENSTED, 1980). The presence of calcite is a few mmol/l and lower compared to \n\nhttp://www.linguee.com.br/ingles-portugues/traducao/source.html\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nthe other main hydration products like portlandite, ettringite and ill crystallized C\u2013S\u2013H \n\n(LOTHENBACH et al., 2008). In uncarbonated fiber-cement specimens, the thermogravimetry \n\nanalysis (TGA) showed decomposition ranged between 650 and 850 \u00b0C that is related to the \n\ncarbon content in as-received cement and calcium carbonate mineral addition (limestone) \n\n(ALMEIDA et al., 2013; SANTOS et al., 2015; PIZZOL et al., 2014). Four phases of crystal \n\nforms calcium carbonate occur with increasing stability, amorphous calcium carbonate, \n\nvaterite, aragonite, and calcite (HOUST et al., 1996).   \n\nThe extra addition of calcium carbonate at the equilibrium reaction of CaCO3 could impede the \n\nformation of calcium carbonate by the chemical equilibrium established in the system, \n\naccording to the equation:   \n\n \n\n??(??)2(?) + ??2(?) ? ????3(?) + H2O        (Eq. 3) \n\nThis study examined the implications of calcium carbonate formed during the hydration process \n\nin cementitious composites subjected to accelerated carbonation curing process. In this context \n\nthe use of limestone as mineral addition could make that measurement challenging. In literature, \n\nit has been found that inert mineral additions could populate the cementitious matrices without \n\ninterfering with the calcium carbonate formation, such as ground crystalline silica.  \n\nAs a strategy to mitigate long term degradation issues, part of the fibre\u2013cement industry \n\nworldwide produces fibre\u2013cement composed of Portland cement, finely ground crystalline \n\nsilica, and cellulose fibre which are autoclaved to confirm appropriate strength, durability and \n\ndimensional stability of the composites (COUTTS et al., 1995; COOKE et al., 2000). \n\nCrystalline silica is soluble in water at high temperatures and pressures (NEWTON et al., 2009). \n\nQuartz has been the most significant crystalline form of SiO2. The quartz used as mineral \n\naddition does not react significantly and is nominally an inert material, offering more space for \n\nhydration products of the PC so as to prolong the acceleration period (LOPEZ, 2009; THOMAS \n\net al., 2011). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n3. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n3.1.   Stage 2: Definition of optional parameters for supercritical carbonation process of \n\nvegetable Fiber-cement composites at a very early age \n\nThe aim of the stage 2 is to study the influence of the bleaching of eucalyptus cellulose pulp, \n\nthe initial curing duration, the CO2 exposure time and accelerated aging cycles, on vegetal fiber-\n\ncement composites subjected to supercritical carbonation at early age.  For this study, samples \n\nwere made by the slurry-dewatering and pressing technique, the bulk matrix was reinforced \n\nwith two kinds of pulp: unbleached and bleached. The unbleached eucalyptus pulp reinforced \n\ncomposites were submitted to three different sets of curing conditions, which allowed for a \n\ncomparison between composite samples with no carbonation and samples carbonated with \n\nvarying thermal curing durations (24 h v. 48 h). Similarly, the bleached eucalyptus pulp samples \n\nwere submitted to five different sets of curing conditions, thus allowing a comparison between \n\nsamples with no carbonation and samples carbonated with varying supercritical carbonation \n\ncuring durations (1 h v. 2 h) and accelerated ageing cycles (200 soak and dry cycles). A variety \n\nof analytical test methods were used to assess the hydration kinetics, the mechanical and the \n\nphysical properties, and chemical implications in the composites; between them: X-ray \n\ndiffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG and DTG) and scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM). The initial period of thermal curing (varying from 24 h to 48 h) and \n\nexposure time to carbonation (from 1 h to 2 h) did not affect with statistical significance the \n\nmechanical performance of the composites.  \n\n3.1.1. Materials and mix design of stage 2 \n\n3.1.1.1. Vegetable fiber \n\nFor the reinforcement, two kinds of eucalyptus pulp were used: unbleached hardwood kraft \n\npulp of eucalyptus (UB) and commercial bleached hardwood kraft pulp of eucalyptus \n\n(Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla) (B). The unbleached and bleached eucalyptus \n\ncellulosic pulp were provided by Suzano Pulp and Paper company and was taken at the \n\nbeginning of the bleaching process and disintegrated, the moisture content was 65 and 45%, \n\nrespectively (MEJIA et al., 2015).  \n\n3.1.1.2. Chemical analyse of Portland cement  \n\nThe cement used in this study was the Brazilian brand ordinary Portland cement type CP V-\n\nARI (high initial strength), corresponding ASTM-C150, Type I. This type of cement according \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nto Santos et al. 2015 is selected for the fibre-cement industry, due to the finer particle size and \n\nhigher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements available on the Brazilian market. The \n\nPC was analyzed through LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Distribution Analyzer and the \n\nresult showed that 50% of the particles are finer than 11.88 \u00b5m. The use of this cement in this \n\nexperiment favored the control of the mineral addition to the cement. \n\n3.1.1.3. Chemical analyse of limestone  \n\nThe mineral addition used in this study was the Brazilian Ita\u00fa brand ground limestone. This \n\nmineral addition was chosen because it is commonly used in the industry for partial substitution \n\nof Portland cement in order to reduce OPC consumption and increase stability (reducing \n\nshrinkage) (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007). The ground limestone was analyzed through \n\nLA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Distribution Analyzer, the result show that 50% of the \n\nparticles are finer than 12.38 \u00b5m. \n\n3.1.1.4. Fibre cement composite mix design  \n\nThe dry mixture (by mass percent) is composed of 77.2% ordinary Portland cement type OCP \n\nV-ARI, 12.8 % calcium carbonate filler (limestone), and 10.0% eucalyptus pulp; is the same \n\nformulation as that used by (ALMEIDA et al., 2013), allowing for a comparison between results \n\nusing a climatic or supercritical chamber for carbonation. Also, this range of fiber contents is \n\ncompatible to the production method used (a crude reproduction of the Hatschek industrial \n\nmethod), which allows the inclusion of a significant amount of fiber in the inorganic matrix \n\n(CORREIA et al., 2014). \n\nThe fibre reinforced cement specimens were cast with the dimensions of 200 mm x 200 mm x \n\n5 mm and mean water/binder ratio of 0.40. The specimens were made using a slurry-dewatering \n\nprocess followed by a pressing technique, as simplified reproduction of the Hatschek process \n\nused in the industrial production of fiber cement (SAVASTANO et al., 2000).  For supercritical \n\ncarbonation, the samples were cut using a diamond bladed water cooled saw into samples with \n\ndimensions (160 mm x 25 mm x 5 mm). These dimensions were necessary for the samples to \n\nfit into the carbonation crucible available in the experimental study in laboratory scale.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Dry mixture (in mass percent) proportions of the composite with unbleached pulp of \n\neucalyptus (UB). \n\nRaw material Mass (%) \n\nordinary Portland cement (OCP V-ARI) 77.2 \n\nLimestone 12.8 \n\nUnbleached pulp of eucalyptus a 10.00 \n\nTotal 100.00 \n\na.

Suzano Pulp and Paper \nSource: authorships. \n\n3.1.1.5. Supercritical CO2 extraction apparatus \n\nThe samples were subjected to supercritical carbonation (SC) in a SULAB brand supercritical \n\nfluid extractor machine (Figure 9). The machine utilizes a series of pressure valves and a pump \n\nto inject CO2 into a steel crucible. Approximate 99.5% concentration pure carbon dioxide is \n\ninjected into a crucible capable of holding six samples at once (Figure 10 a-c). The CO2 \n\nemployed in the experiments was supplied by the White Martins Gas Industrials Company \n\n(Brazil). For the entirety of the carbonation, the steel crucible was immersed in a thermal bath \n\nat 45\u00b0C (Figure 10 d). The pressure within the crucible can be regulated using the system of \n\nseals and gaskets. For this study, a pressure of 20 MPa within the chamber was used, tried to \n\nensuring a nearly complete carbonation of samples (for a duration of 2 h within the chamber) \n\n(Figure 10 e). Of course, the change in pressure is not instantaneous, therefore the first hour of \n\ncarbonation corresponds to a \u201cbuild-up\u201d period for the pressure to reach 20 MPa, at which point \n\nsamples remain in the chamber for a second hour in order to complete the carbonation cycle. \n\n(SANTOS et al., 2015).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Supercritical CO2 extraction apparatus.  \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: (MARTINEZ et al., 2011). \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Schematic experiment at the chamber: a) Carbonation crucible being loaded with \n\ncement samples. b) Samples average size was 25 mm. c) Carbonation crucible loaded with \n\ncement samples were connect to extractor. d) Submerged crucible in thermal bath (45\u00b0 C). e) \n\nPressure gauge of 20 MPa.  \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n3.1.2. Curing and conditioning regimes stage 2 \n\nThe different sets of curing conditions use the following nomenclature: the first one or two \n\nletters indicate what type of pulp was used for that batch of samples (B for bleached, UB for \n\nunbleached) which are summarized in Table 4.  Close examination of the processes described \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nin Table 4, reveals that it is possible to isolate the effect of the initial thermal hydration duration \n\n(24 h and 48 h); carbonation exposure (0 h, 1 h or 2 h of curing in an environment with close \n\n100% CO2 concentration); and, accelerated ageing cycles (0 cycles or 200 cycles). The eight \n\nconditions shown in Table 4 were cast with the same w/c ratio but with two kinds of eucalyptus \n\npulp as reinforcement and treated with different curing regimes.  \n\n \n\n3.1.2.1. Uncarbonated curing (UC) regime \n\nAfter the samples were cast, they underwent 48 hours of thermal curing in a chamber at a RH \n\nof 90% at 45\u00b0C, some of them correspond to unbleached pulp samples (UB) and the other ones \n\nbleached pulp samples (B). The specimens were then removed from the chamber, sealed, stored \n\nin air curing at temperature of 25\u00b0C, RH of 90%, and atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.035 \n\nvol%). Upon completing the curing process of eleven days, characterization tests were \n\nperformed. These samples belong to the uncarbonated curing (UC) regime. \n\n3.1.2.2. Supercritical carbonation (SC) curing regime \n\nAfter the samples were cast, the unbleached pulp samples UB-SC-48-2 underwent 48 hours of \n\nthermal curing in an environmental chamber at a RH of 90% at 45\u00b0C, while the samples UB-\n\nSC-24-2 underwent 24 hours with the same environmental chamber conditions. Following \n\nthermal curing, both curing regimes were carbonated for 2 h in a Supercritical CO2 extraction \n\napparatus. The bleached pulp samples were also subjected to 48 hours of thermal curing. After \n\nthe thermal curing, the sample B-SC-48-2 was carbonated for 2 h while sample B-SC-48-1 was \n\ncarbonated for 1 h in a Supercritical CO2 extraction apparatus (SANTOS et al., 2015). The \n\nspecimens were then removed from the apparatus, sealed, stored in air curing at temperature of \n\n25 \u00b0C, RH of 90%, and atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.035 vol%)\n (SANTOS et al., 2015). \n\nUpon completing the curing process of eleven days, characterization tests were performed. \n\nThese samples bellows to the supercritical curing (SC) regime. \n\n3.1.2.3. Accelerated ageing: soak-dry cycles \n\nThe accelerated ageing test was conducted on two sets of samples, one set of specimens that \n\nhad not undergone the carbonation curing regime, namely, B-AAC, and one set of specimens \n\nthat had been exposed to the 2 h carbonation curing in a SC, namely, B-SC-48-2-AAC.  The \n\nspecimens were then removed from the apparatus, sealed and stored in air curing at temperature \n\nof 25 \u00b0C and atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.035 vol%). Upon completing the curing process \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nof eleven days, samples were subjected to accelerated ageing cycles. Then, characterization \n\ntests were performed on both sets. \n\nThe accelerated ageing cycles (AAC) aims to simulate the natural ageing with exposure to \n\nsoaking and drying cycles as tested in previous works (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; TONOLI et al., \n\n2009). The bleached cellulosic pulp samples were successively immersed into water at 20\u00b0 \u00b1 \n\n5\u00b0C for 170 min and, after an interval of 10 min, they were heated to the temperature of 60\u00b0 \u00b1 \n\n5\u00b0C for 170 min in a ventilated oven. Another interval of 10 min at room temperature elapses \n\nbefore the subsequent cycle, as recommended by the EN 494 Standard (1994). Each soak and \n\ndry set represents one cycle, which was repeated 200 times, i.e., 200 ageing cycles. \n\nTable 4 - Description of curing regimes applied at stage 1. \n\nCuring Regime \n\nIdentification \n\nThermal Hydration \n\nDuration in with: \n\nCO2 = 0.035% \n\nTemp. = 60\u00b0 C \n\nRH=  90 % \n\nCarbonation Duration in \n\nChamber with: \n\nCO2 = 99.5% \n\nTemp. = 45\u00b0 C \n\nRH=  90 % \n\nAccelerated Ageing \n\nCycles \n\nUB 48 h 0 h 0 cycles \n\nUB-SC-48-2 48 h 2 h 0 cycles \n\nUB-SC-24-2 24 h 2 h 0 cycles \n\nB 48 h 0 h 0 cycles \n\nB-SC-48-1 48 h 1 h 0 cycles \n\nB-SC-48-2 48 h 2 h 0 cycles \n\nB-AAC 48 h 0 h 200 cycles \n\nB-SC-48-2-AAC 48 h 2 h 200 cycles \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n3.1.3.

Physical characterization of the fiber-cement composites \n\nApparent Void Volume (AVV), bulk density (BD), and water absorption (WA) of the \n\ncomposites were obtained from the average of eight test specimens (160 mm x 25 mm x 5 mm) \n\nfor each condition, following the procedures specified by ASTM C 948-81 (2009).

Mechanical characterization of the fiber-cement composites \n\nMechanical properties were obtained for uncarbonated curing (UC), Supercritical carbonation \n\ncuring (SC) and composites upon completing the curing process of fourteen days. Each fiber \n\ncement specimen was wet cut into four samples measuring 160 mm by 25 mm for the \n\nmechanical test, using a water cooled diamond saw.  \n\nEight specimens were evaluated for each condition; mechanical four-point bending flexural \n\ntests were performed in an EMIC DL-30000 testing machine equipped with a 1 kN load cell, a \n\nfour-point bending configuration, a lower span of 135 mm, an upper span of 45 mm and a \n\ndeflection rate of 1.5 mm/min. The mechanical properties evaluated were: Modulus of rupture \n\n(MOR), Limit of proportionality (LOP), Modulus of elasticity (MOE) and Specific Energy \n\n(SE).

Thermal analysis TG/DTG \n\nChemical changes such degradation of cellulose, as well as transition temperatures in fiber \n\nbased composites, are studied through derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) \n\n(SATYANARAYANA et al., 2009); the samples were ground using a pestle and mortar, sieved \n\nuntil particles smaller than 75 ?m, then analyzed in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer NETZSCH \n\nSTA 449 F3. The experimental conditions were: rates of 10\u00b0C/min for heating and 40 mL/min \n\nfor nitrogen injection. The sample with range (20 \u2013 900\u00b0C) at a constant rate (ROSTAMI et al., \n\n2012; PIZZOL et al., 2014), yielding TGA and DTG curves of the extruded cellulosic fiber\u2013\n\ncement submitted to supercritical CO2 curing (SC) and uncarbonated (UC) treatments.  The \n\namount of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, and calcium carbonate, CaCO3, was estimated from \n\nthe weight loss measured in the TGA curve between the initial and final temperature of the \n\ncorresponding DTG peak. \n\nThermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) were used to \n\ninspect the nature of hydration products formed in the cement-based systems. The different \n\nDTG peaks measured when hydrated cement is heated in a thermobalance correspond to: at 100 \n\n\u00b0C - weight loss due to the dehydration of water pores, between 100 \u00b0C to 300 \u00b0C - different \n\nstages of dehydration of C\u2013S\u2013H, at 500 \u00b0C - dehydroxylation of Ca(OH)2, and at 700 \u00b0C - \n\ndecarbonation of CaCO3 (ROSTAMI et al., 2012). \n\n3.1.3.4.

The diffractometer produces waves at a known \n\nfrequency, which is determined by their source. This technique was applied in order to identify \n\nthe main crystalline phases and compere between the specimens for the principal found \n\ncomponents in Portland cement hydrated. The single crystal diffraction and the angle between \n\nthe beam axis and the ring is called the scattering angle and in X-ray crystallography always \n\ndenoted as 2?

The \n\nidentification of the phases were made throught the data base \u201cInternational Centre for \n\nDiffraction Data\u201d (ICDD). \n\nThe X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique, allows the identification of crystalline phases in \n\nmaterials, (CHANG et al., 2006). The analyses were performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600, \n\nwith range 10-60\u00b0 (2?) and rate of 15\u00b0/min.    \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n3.1.3.5.

The images were captured by a Hitachi Tabletop Microscope \n\nTM3000. \n\nThe preparation of specimens for BSE was accomplished with impregnation using epoxy resin. \n\nBSE samples were manually polished in a Struers TegraPol-11 machine using silicon carbide \n\nabrasive paper with sequential grit sizes 320, 600, 1000 for 6 min, using isopropyl alcohol as \n\nlubricant. A final polishing was carried out using in turn 6, 3, l \u00b5m diamond polishing \n\ncompound for 6 min with each size.  \n\nApproximately six SEM micrographs were obtained for each composite treatment, with typical \n\nimages of the observed microstructure being used in this manuscript. \n\n3.2. Stage 3: Comparative study between two kinds of mineral addition in cellulose pulp \n\nfiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age. \n\nThe aim of this stage 3 is to compare two kinds of mineral addition on vegetal fiber-cement \n\ncomposites subjected to accelerated carbonation at a very early age.  For this study, samples \n\nwere produced by the slurry-dewatering and pressing technique. The samples were submitted \n\nto carbonation process, with varying the mineral addition (limestone v. ground silica) and the \n\ninitial curing durations (10 h v. 24 h). A variety of analytical test methods were used to assess \n\nthe hydration kinetics, the mechanical and the physical properties, and chemical implications \n\nin the composites; between them: X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy \n\n(SEM).  \n\n3.2.1.

The fiber is produced by \n\nthe OJSC Solombala Pulp and Paper Mill - brand located in the industrial zone of the city \n\nof Arkhangelsk, in North-West Russia. This is a type of fibre Pine Spruce, processed as \n\nunbleached northern softwood kraft.  Morton et al. (2010) physically describe the Solombala \n\npinus fibre with an average length of 2.7 mm, coarseness of 15.55 mg/100 m, wall thickness of \n\n7.9 \u00b5m, and a fibre width of 30.7 \u00b5m. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2.Chemical analyse of Portland cement \n\nThe cement used in this study was the Brazilian Cau\u00ea brand ordinary Portland cement type PC \n\nV-ARI (high initial strength), corresponding ASTM-C150, Type I, this type of cement \n\naccording to Santos et al. 2015 is selected for fibre reinforced cementitious composites, due the \n\nfiner particle size and higher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements available in the \n\nBrazilian market. The PC V-ARI was analyzed through LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size \n\nDistribution Analyzer, the result show that 50% of the particles are finer than 8.67 \u00b5m.  \n\n3.2.1.3. Chemical analyse of Limestone   \n\nThe mineral addition used in this study was the Brazilian Ita\u00fa brand ground limestone (L). This \n\nmineral addition was chosen because it is commonly used in the industry for partial substitution \n\nof Portland cement in order to reduce OPC consumption and increase stability (reducing \n\nshrinkage) (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007). The ground limestone was analyzed through \n\nLA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Distribution Analyzer, the result show that 50% of the \n\nparticles are finer than 12.38 \u00b5m. Figure 11 shows the XRD, the analysis was made by a Rigaku \n\nMiniFlex 600 with range 10-60\u00b0 (2?) and rate of 15\u00b0/min.  \n\nFigure 12 shows the XRD patterns of quantification of the phases for limestone. The chemical \n\ncompositions of the limestone are calcite with 68.4%, dolomite 29% and quartz 2.6%, \n\ndetermined through the software PANalytical HighScore Plus, using Rietveld method.  Various \n\nresearch shows that the reaction occurs on a definite boundary between the lime and carbonate \n\nphases (HILLS, 1968). \n\nThe presence of dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] in this cementitious composite can be explained as it \n\nis one of the forms limestone and has a similar crystal structure to that of calcite, having a face-\n\ncentred rhombohedral cell (MCINTOSH et al., 1990).  \n\nDolomite reaction involves the direct formation of calcium carbonate via Magnesian calcite \n\nwith a gradual release of Mg2+ ions to form calcite. It is proposed that the progression of carbon \n\ndioxide from surface defects initiates decomposition, dissociation into the two carbonates as \n\ndescribed in eq. (11) (HASHIMOTO et al., 1976; MCINTOSH et al., 1990). \n\n????(??3)2 ? ????3 + ????3     (Eq. 11). \n\nFigure 11 - XRD patterns of the limestone. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\nFigure 12 - XRD crystalline phases analysis of the limestone. \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n3.2.1.4.

Mechanical characterization of the fiber-cement composites  \n\nMechanical properties were obtained for carbonated curing (AC), and composites upon \n\ncompleting the curing process of seven days. Each fiber cement specimen was wet cut into four \n\nsamples measuring 160 mm by 25 mm for the mechanical test, using a water cooled diamond \n\nsaw.  \n\nEight specimens were evaluated for each condition. Mechanical four-point bending flexural \n\ntests were performed in an EMIC DL-30000 universal testing machine with a 1 kN load cell, a \n\nfour-point bending configuration, a lower span of 135 mm, an upper span of 45 mm and a \n\ndeflection rate of 1.5 mm/min. The mechanical properties evaluated were: Modulus of rupture \n\n(MOR), Limit of proportionality (LOP), Modulus of elasticity (MOE) and Specific Energy \n\n(SE). Mechanical properties were obtained using Eqs. 7 \u2013 10 as described in detail by \n\n(ALMEIDA et al., 2013; TONOLI et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n???

SE, was defined as the \n\nenergy absorbed during the flexural test and divided by the specimen cross-sectional area \n\n(ALMEIDA et al., 2013; TONOLI et al., 2009).   \n\n3.2.3.3. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis \n\nThis XRD technique consists in identifying crystalline phases present in samples, as a \n\nqualitative analysis. The diffractometer produces waves at a known frequency, which is \n\ndetermined by their source. This technique was applied in order to identify the main crystalline \n\nphases and compare between the specimens for the main components in Portland cement \n\nhydrated. The single crystal diffraction and the angle between the beam axis and the ring is \n\ncalled the scattering angle and in X-ray crystallography always denoted as 2? (in scattering \n\nof the convention is usually to call it ?). The identification of the phases was made throughout \n\nthe data base \u201cInternational Centre for Diffraction Data\u201d (ICDD). \n\nThe X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique, allows the identification of crystalline phases in \n\nmaterials, (CHANG et al., 2006). The analyses were performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600, \n\nwith range 10-60\u00b0 (2?) and rate of 15\u00b0/min. \n\nInternational Centre Diffraction Data (2003) and PANalytical HighScore Plus Inorganic Crystal \n\nStructure Database (2007) were applied to identify crystalline phases. The PANalytical \n\nHighScore Plus was used too for made a quantification estimative of the clinker phases, \n\nconsidering only the crystalline part of the material and excluding the amorphous part.   \n\n3.2.3.4. Microstructural analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy - (SEM/EDS) \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used with a back-scattered electron image (BSEI) \n\ndetector and was carried out the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDS), \n\noperated at 15 kV accelerating voltage, for visualization of the microstructure on the surface of \n\nthe composites. The images were captured by a Hitachi Tabletop Microscope TM3000. \n\nThe preparation of specimens for BSE was accomplished with impregnation using epoxy resin. \n\nBSE samples were manually polished in a Struers TegraPol-11 machine using silicon carbide \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nabrasive paper with sequential grit sizes 320, 600, 1000 for 6 min, using isopropyl alcohol as \n\nlubricant. A final polishing was carried out using in turn 6, 3, l \u00b5m diamond polishing \n\ncompound for 6 min with each size.  \n\nApproximately SEM micrographs were obtained for each composite treatment, with typical \n\nimages of the observed microstructure being used in this manuscript.  \n\n3.3. Stage 4: Durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-cement \n\ncomposites using silica as a mineral addition. \n\nThe aim of this stage 4 is to study the durability and hydration kinetics in carbonated composites \n\nreinforced with unbleached pines cellulose pulp fiber and used silica as a mineral addition. \n\nSamples were prepared by the slurry-dewatering and pressing technique. The samples were \n\nsubmitted to two different sets of curing conditions, which allowed for a comparison between \n\nuncarbonated samples and samples carbonated with varying initial curing durations (10 h v. 24 \n\nh) and then subjected to 200 accelerated ageing cycles. A variety of analytical test methods \n\nwere used to assess the hydration kinetics, the mechanical and the physical properties, and \n\nchemical implications in the composites: X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis \n\n(TG), Infrared spectrometer (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and B.E.T. surface \n\narea analyzer.  \n\n3.3.1. Materials and mix design of stage 4 \n\n3.3.1.1. Vegetable fibre   \n\nUnrefined pine unbleached cellulosic pulp was used in this study.  The fiber is produced by the \n\nOJSC Solombala Pulp and Paper Mill, from Arkhangelsk, in North-West Russia. This is a type \n\nof fibre Pinus Spruce, processed as unbleached northern softwood kraft. Morton et al. (2010) \n\nphysically describe the solombala pinus fibre with an average length of 2.7 mm, coarseness of \n\n15.55 mg/100 m, wall thickness of 7.9 ?m, and a fibre width of 30.7 ?m???  \n\n \n\n3.3.1.2.  Chemical analyse of Portland cement  \n\nThe cement used in this study was the Brazilian Cau\u00ea brand ordinary Portland cement type OCP \n\nV-ARI (high initial strength), corresponding ASTM-C150, Type I, this kind of cement \n\naccording to Santos et al. (2015) is selected for fibre reinforced cementitious composites, due \n\nthe finer particle size and higher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements available in \n\nthe Brazilian market. The OPC V-ARI was analyzed through LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nSize Distribution Analyzer, the result showed that 50% of the particles are finer than 8.67 \u00b5m. \n\nOxide composition of the OPC V material was accomplished by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Table \n\n8 shows these compositions. The oxide composition was investigated by a Philips PW 1410 type \n\nwavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer controlled by Philips X31 version 2.13 \n\nsoftware. X-rays are generated at 50 mA and 50 kV by X-ray tube with chromium anode. \n\n3.3.1.3.

The particle size distribution of the silica \n\nmineral addition showed that 50% of the particles are finer than 17.59 ?m.

Curing and conditioning regimes of stage 4 \n\nThis experiment exposes the composite specimens to eight different curing and ageing \n\nconditions, which are summarized in Table 10.  Close examination of the processes described \n\nin Table 10, reveals that it is possible to isolate the effect of hydration duration (10 h and 24 h); \n\ncarbonation exposure (0 h or 10 h of curing in an environment with 20% CO2 concentration); \n\nand, accelerated ageing cycles (0 cycles or 200 cycles). \n\n3.3.2.1. Uncarbonated curing (UC) regime  \n\nAfter the samples were casted, some of them were stored in favorable conditions for hydration \n\nduring 10 h (P-UC-10), and the others were stored in the favorable hydration conditions for 24 \n\nh (P-UC-24) in the Thermotron climate chamber, at temperature of 25\u00b0C and relative humidity \n\n(RH) of 90%. After that initial curing conditions, for both hydration durations, the settings of \n\nthe Thermotron ESPEC environmental test chamber were 45\u00b0C temperature, 90% relative \n\nhumidity (RH) and atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.035 vol%) for 10 h. The specimens were \n\nthen removed from the chamber and stored in thermal curing at temperature of 60\u00b0C and 90% \n\nrelative humidity (RH), composites upon completing the thermal curing process of six days \n\nwere subjected to the characterization tests (ROJAS et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n3.3.2.2. Accelerated carbonation (AC) curing regime \n\nAfter the samples were casted, some specimens were stored in the favorable hydration \n\nconditions for 10 h (P-AC-10) and the other group was stored in the hydration condition for 24 \n\nh (P-AC-24) in the Thermotron environmental test chamber, at temperature of 25\u00b0C relative \n\nhumidity (RH) of 90%. Both sets of samples were then subjected to 10 h of accelerated \n\ncarbonation in the ESPEC brand environmental test chamber at temperature of 45\u00b0C and \n\nrelative humidity (RH) of 90%.

Accelerated ageing: soak-dry cycles \n\nThe accelerated ageing test was conducted on four sets of samples which are two sets of \n\nspecimens that had not undergone the carbonation curing regime, namely, P-UC-10-ACC and \n\nP-UC-24-AAC, and two sets of specimens that had been exposed to the 10 h carbonation curing, \n\nnamely, P-AC-10-ACC and P-AC-24-AAC. The specimens were successively immersed into \n\nwater at 20 \u00b1 5\u00b0C for 170 min and, after 10 min, they were heated to the temperature of 60 \u00b1 \n\n5\u00b0C for 170 min in a ventilated oven. Another interval of 10 min at room temperature elapses \n\nbefore the subsequent cycle, as recommended by the EN 494 Standards 1994.

The samples were ground using a pestle and mortar, \n\nsieved until particles smaller than 75 ?m, then analyzed in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer with \n\nNETZSCH TASC 414/3 T6. Experimental test was performed in the temperature range of 20 \n\nto 900\u00b0C and rates of 10\u00b0C/min for heating and 40 mL/min of nitrogen injection (PIZZOL et \n\nal., 2014; ROSTAMI et al., 2012). Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and differential \n\nthermogravimetry (DTG) were used to inspect the nature of hydration and carbonate products \n\nformed in the cement-based systems. The different DTG peaks measured when hydrated cement \n\nwas heated in the thermobalance correspond to:  \n\n\u2022 100\u00b0C - weight loss due to the dehydration of water pores; \n\n\u2022 100 to 300\u00b0C - different stages of dehydration of C\u2013S\u2013H; \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\n\u2022 500\u00b0C - dehydroxylation of Ca(OH)2; \n\n\u2022 700\u00b0C - decarbonation of CaCO3. \n\nThe accelerated carbonation increased the mass loss at the range between 650 and 750\u00b0C related \n\nto decomposition of the poorly crystallized CaCO3 and at the range between 750 and 850\u00b0C \n\nrelated to decomposition of the well-crystallized CaCO3, as also reported elsewhere \n\n(ROSTAMI et al., 2012; PIZZOL et al., 2014). \n\n3.3.3.4. FTIR Spectrometer analysis \n\nThe molecular identification of the composite of the eight sets of curing regimes, were studied \n\nthrough the diffuse reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.  The vibrations of \n\nmolecules were measured with a TENSOR 27 FTIR with an insert cell for diffuse reflection \n\nspectroscopy.  The measurement range lies between 400 and 4,000 cm-1 with a nominal \n\nresolution of 2 cm-1. \n\nThe DR-FTIR spectroscopy technique relies on the vibration modes of characteristic groups in \n\na compound, i.e. not on the crystallinity of the sample. FTIR spectra of the uncarbonated and \n\ncarbonated samples also confirm ??3\n2 from calcium carbonate polymorphs (between 850\u2013890 \n\ncm-1 and 1400\u20131500 cm-1), ??4\n2(between 900\u20131000 cm-1) and OH- (between 3200\u20133500 cm-1) \n\ngroups from ettringite and S-rich phases. Thus DR-FTIR spectroscopy is a very suitable method \n\nfor monitoring the formation of compounds such as carbonates in cement (YLM\u00c9N et al., \n\n2013). \n\n3.3.3.5. Phases analysis X-Ray diffraction (XRD) \n\nThe crystalline phases identification of the composite of the eight sets of curing regimes, were \n\nstudied through the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The phase identification and structural changes \n\nof the products was investigated by a Philips PW-1730 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) equipment. \n\nPeak position (2?) with range 10-60\u00b0, the full-width at half maximum (FWHM), and area under \n\npeak (A) were obtained from the XRD spectra. \n\nInternational Centre Diffraction Data (2003) and PANalytical HighScore Plus Inorganic Crystal \n\nStructure Database (2007) were applied to identify crystalline phases. The PANalytical \n\nHighScore Plus was also applied for a quantitative estimative of the clinker phases, considering \n\nonly the crystalline part of the material and excluding the amorphous part.   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n3.3.3.6. Microstructural analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy - (SEM) \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied with a back-scattered electron (BSE) image \n\ndetector, operated at 15 kV accelerating voltage, for visualization of the microstructure on the \n\nsurface of the composites. The images were captured by a JEOL machine, model 6610 \n\nLV. Magnification ranged from 300 up to 750x.  \n\nThe preparation of specimens for BSE was accomplished with impregnation using epoxy resin. \n\nBSE samples were manually polished in a Struers TegraPol-11 machine using silicon carbide \n\nabrasive paper with sequential grit sizes 320, 600, 1000 for 6 min, using alcohol as lubricant. \n\nA final polishing was carried out using in turn 6, 3 and l \u00b5m diamond polishing compound \n\nduring 6 min each size.  \n\nAround six SEM micrographs were obtained for each composite treatment and just the most \n\nrelevant images of the microstructure observed were displayed in this manuscript. The energy-\n\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was carried out through Inca software.  \n\n \n\n3.3.3.7. Dynamic water vapor sorption- BET method \n\nDynamic vapor sorption (DVS) was also used to investigate the mesopore structure of the eight \n\ncuring regimes composites. The dynamic vapor adsorption method is performed using a facility \n\nprovided by Surface Measurement System Ltd. London, UK. Approximately 0.1 g of dry \n\nsample in small pieces was placed on a dish in the chamber in which the RH could be precisely \n\nand automatically controlled by mixing a proportional amount of nitrogen gas and moisture. \n\nThe RH was then changed by step each time until the mass change was lower than 0.002% (by \n\nmass fraction, the same below) per minute until the target RH of 30% (LIWU AND PANESAR, \n\n2014). \n\nThe Brunauer Emmett Teller BET method deduces the adsorption branch of an isotherm to \n\nprovide an amount of the specific surface area of the inner pore area, an indication of overall \n\nporosity (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, 1985). This measure, referred to \n\nas the BET specific surface area, is derived from the humidity content of the sample when a \n\ncomplete sorptive monolayer has formed. It is assumed that a complete monolayer is formed \n\non all available inner surfaces prior to any multilayer condensation due to the difference \n\nbetween heats of adsorption and liquefaction of the adsorbent (BRUNAUER et al., 1938). The \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nBET specific surface area, ABET, is calculated as (COLLETT et al., 2008; PANESAR et al., \n\n2014): \n\n???? = ???\n??\n\n??\n     (Eq. 13) \n\nwhere ?m is the surface area of an adsorbed molecule of water (10 \u00c52), N is Avogadro\u2019s number \n\n(6.023 x1023), wm is the moisture content at monolayer saturation (kg/kg), and Mm is the molar \n\nmass of water (18.07 g/mol) (BRUNAUER et al., 1938). \n\n3.4. Stage 5: Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-\n\ncement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age \n\nThe aim of stage 5 is to study the carbonation kinetic hydration at very early age on unbleached \n\npines cellulose pulp fiber-cement composites using silica as a mineral addition. For this study, \n\nsamples were prepared by the slurry-dewatering and pressing technique. The carbonation \n\nprocess was monitored along 10 h, each hour corresponds to a condition. A variety of analytical \n\ntest methods was used to assess the hydration kinetics, the chemical implications in the \n\ncomposites; between them: X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG and \n\nDTG), Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  \n\n3.4.1. Materials and mix design stage 5 \n\n3.4.1.1. Vegetable fibre   \n\nUnrefined pine unbleached cellulosic pulp was used in this study.  The fiber is produced by the \n\nOJSC Solombala Pulp and Paper Mill - brand located in the industrial zone of the city \n\nof Arkhangelsk, in North-West Russia. This is a type of fibre Pine Spruce, processed as \n\nunbleached northern softwood kraft.  Morton et al. (2010) physically describe the Solombala \n\npinus fibre with an average length of 2.7 mm, coarseness of 15.55 mg/100 m, wall thickness of \n\n7.9 ?m, and a fibre width of 30.7 ?m???  \n\n3.4.1.2. Chemical analyse of Portland Cement  \n\nThe cement used in this study was the Brazilian Cau\u00ea brand ordinary Portland cement type OCP \n\nV-ARI (high initial strength), corresponding to the ASTM-C150, Type I. According to Santos \n\net al. (2015), this type of cement is selected for fibre reinforced cementitious composites, due \n\nto the finer particle size and higher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements available \n\nin the Brazilian market. The OPC type V-ARI is well known to be high sulfate resistant, as the \n\nchemical reaction between cement compounds and sulfates causes undesirable expansion of the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nmixture. The OPC was characterized through LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size \n\nDistribution Analyzer, and the results show that 50% of the particles are finer than 8.67 \u00b5m.  \n\n \n\n3.4.1.3. Chemical analyse of Ground silica \n\nSilica quartz type is a neutral material, chemically and thermodynamically very stable at low \n\ntemperatures (e.g. 45\u00b0C) and atmospheric pressure. This material could be used as mineral \n\naddition in carbonated cementitious composites for avoiding interference with the main \n\ncrystalline phases formed along the accelerated carbonation process (FOURNIER AND \n\nROWE, 1977; SINGH et al. 2013).  \n\nThe crystalline silica used in this work was supported by Brazilian Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Jundu with a real \n\ndensity of 2.65 (g/cm3). The particle size distribution of the silica mineral addition shows that \n\n50% of the particles are finer than 17.6 ?m.  \n\n3.4.1.4. Fibre cement composite mix design \n\nThe raw materials with their respective amount, used on the fiber-cement composites are shown \n\nin Table 11. The formulation is based on previous work carried out by Almeida et al. (2010). \n\nThe dry mixture (by mass percent) is composed of 64% Brazilian Cau\u00ea brand ordinary Portland \n\ncement type OPC V-ARI (high initial strength), corresponding to ASTM-C150, Type I \n\n(PICAN\u00c7O et al., 2008), 28% Brazilian Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Jundu brand silica quartz type mineral \n\naddition, and 8% unrefined pine unbleached cellulosic pulp. \n\nThe fibre reinforced cement specimens were cast with the dimensions of 200 mm x 200 mm x \n\n5 mm and mean water/binder factor of 0.40.  The specimens were elaborated using a slurry-\n\ndewatering process followed by a pressing technique, as a simplified reproduction of the \n\nHatschek process used in the industrial production of fibre cement (SAVASTANO et al., 2000). \n\nTable 11 - Dry mixture proportions (% by mass) of the composite \n\nRaw material Mass (%) \n\nOrdinary Portland cement (CP V-ARI) 64.0 \n\nSilica 28.0 \n\nUnbleached pine cellulosic pulpa 8.0 \n\nTotal 100.0 \n\na.

Curing and conditioning regimes of stage 5 \n\nThis experiment exposes the composite specimens to eleven different curing conditions, which \n\nare summarized in Table 12 and the curing process shows at Figure 15.  Close examination of \n\nthe processes described in Table 12 reveals that it is possible to isolate the effect of hydration \n\nduration (10 h and 24 h) and carbonation exposure (from 0 h up to 10 h of curing in an \n\nenvironment with 20% CO2 concentration). \n\n3.4.2.1. Accelerated carbonation (AC) curing regime \n\nAfter preparation, the samples were stored in the chamber for initial hydration condition for \n\n24h at climatic test chamber at 25\u00b0C and relative humidity (RH) of 90% (Figure 15 - a.).  Then \n\nthey were removed from the chamber and each fibre-cement specimen was cut into four samples \n\nmeasuring 100 mm by 50 mm (Figure 15 - c.). All samples were introduced at the same time in \n\nthe climate chamber for the accelerated carbonation at 45\u00b0C and relative humidity (RH) of 90%. \n\nThe CO2 content in the climate chamber was monitored to be 20 vol%. One hour after the \n\ninitiation of the carbonation process, two cut samples were removed from the chamber, then \n\nimmersed in acetone, in order to stop the hydration; this process was repeated until the \n\ncompletion of the 10 conditions corresponding to each hour of carbonation process along 10 h. \n\nThe samples were monitored during carbonation process using phenolphthalein indicator. For \n\neach hour of carbonation, small pieces of the specimens were removed for checking the status \n\nof the internal region of the cross section, according to the intensity of the color displayed by \n\nthe indicator (Figure 15 - d.). Table 12 shows the description of curing regimes applied. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\nFigure 15 - Study of the hydration kinetic of accelerated carbonation along 10 h. a.) \n\nSpecimens at climatic test chamber; b.)

Test methods of stage 5 \n\n3.4.3.1. Thermal analysis DTA/TGA \n\n The efficiency of carbonation process for the eleven sets of curing regimes, was studied \n\nthrough the differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry analysis (TG) \n\n(SATYANARAYANA, et al., 2009). The samples were ground using a pestle and mortar, \n\nsieved until particles smaller than 75 ?m, then analyzed in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer with \n\nNETZSCH TASC 414/3 T6. Equipment was used in a temperature range of 20 to 900\u00b0C and \n\nrates of 10\u00b0C/min for heating and 40 mL/min for nitrogen injection (PIZZOL et al., 2014; \n\nROSTAMI et al., 2012).  \n\nFor the uncarbonated samples there is one clear endothermic peak at 460\u00b0C which matches with \n\nCa(OH)2. For the carbonated samples, there is also a clear endothermic peak at 800\u00b0C \n\ncorresponding to CaCO3 (SKOOG et al., 1994; LIWU et al., 2012). Therefore, the accelerated \n\ncarbonation increased the mass loss at the range between 650 and 750\u00b0C related to \n\ndecomposition of the poorly crystallized CaCO3 and at the range between 750 and 850\u00b0C related \n\nto decomposition of the well-crystallized CaCO3, as also reported by (ROSTAMI et al., 2012; \n\nPIZZOL et al., 2014). \n\n3.4.3.2.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  \n\n4.1.   Stage 2: Definition of optional parameters for supercritical carbonation process of \n\nvegetable Fiber-cement composites at a very early age \n\n4.1.1. Mechanical and physical characteristics of stage 2 \n\nTable 13 presents a summary of the average values and corresponding standard deviation of the \n\nphysical properties (AVV, BD and WA) and mechanical properties (MOR, LOP, MOE and \n\nSE), under flexural loading respectively for all curing scenarios.  \n\nThe curing conditions were conducted on eight sets of samples which were three sets reinforced \n\nwith unbleached eucalyptus pulp and five sets reinforced with bleached eucalyptus pulp. For \n\nboth types of reinforcing pulp, the effect of supercritical carbonation exposure was studied (0 \n\nh, 1 h or 2 h of curing in an environment with close 100% CO2 concentration); for the set of \n\nunbleached pulp the effect of thermal hydration duration was studied (24 h and 48 h); and for \n\nbleached pulp samples the effect of accelerated ageing cycles was studied (0 and 200 soak and \n\ndry cycles). A summary of the statistical significance testing is presented in Table 14 for the \n\nphysical and mechanical properties.  A \u20180\u2019 in the table averages that there is no statistically \n\nsignificant difference between the averages, \u2018+\u2019 indicates that there is a statistically significant \n\ndifference between the means with the first listed condition having higher averages than the \n\nsecond, and \u2018-\u2019 indicates the first listed condition had a lower mean than the second. E.g. for \n\nthe AVV column of UB vs. UB-SC-48-2, the \u2018+\u2019 indicates that the averages AVV of UB was \n\ngreater than that of UB-SC-48-2, whereas the \u2018-\u2019 in the BD column indicates the UB samples \n\nhad a lower average BD than the UB-SC-48-2 samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 13 - Physical and mechanical properties of specimens exposed to various curing regimes (average \u00b1 standard of deviation). \n\nCuring Regime \n\nIdentification \nAVV (%) BD (g/cm3) WA (%) MOR (MPa) \n\nLOP \n\n(MPa) \nMOE (GPa) \n\nSE \n\n(J/m2) \n\nUB 34.36 (1.4) 1.41 (0.03) 24.48 (1.6) 7.49 (1.4) 3.15 (0.8) 7.718 (0.8) 3.22 (1.5) \n\nUB-SC-48-2 30.80 (0.5) 1.61 (0.03) 19.10 (0.4) 12.83 (2.8) 6.59 (0.7) 10.676 (1.7) 2.57 (0.7) \n\nUB-SC-24-2 33.10 (0.3) 1.61 (0.02) 20.57 (0.4) 11.27 (2.2) 5.85 (1.1) 10.446 (1.4) 2.54 (0.8) \n\nB 34.79 (0.6) 1.49 (0.02) 23.35 (0.7) 8.97 (0.6) 4.23 (2.1) 8.559 (0.9) 2.30 (1.1) \n\nB-SC-48-1 31.50 (0.4) 1.68 (0.02) 18.78 (0.4) 15.79 (2.4) 7.91 (1.1) 13.711 (1.13) 3.28 (1.1) \n\nB-SC-48-2 30.20 (0.6) 1.69 (0.02) 17.92 (0.03) 16.94 (2.0) 8.73 (0.7) 14.758 (1.2) 3.42 (0.9) \n\nB-AAC 30.28 (2.8) 1.52 (0.04) 19.94 (5.8) 7.20 (2.5) 6.03 (1.7) 11102.67 (1.5) 0.34 (0.2) \n\nB-SC-48-2-AAC 28.78 (1.3) 1.76 (0.03) 16.40 (4.6) 12.09 (2.5) 7.52 (1.6) 17269.83 (1.5) 1.27 (0.7) \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\nTable 14 - Statistically Significance of the Difference between the average of stage one (at 95% confidence level) \n\nExperimental \n\nVariable \n\nComparison of \n\naverage between \nCuring Regimes: \n\nAVV \n\n(%) \n\nBD  \n\n(g/cm3) \n\nWA \n\n(%) \n\nMOR \n\n(MPa) \n\nLOP \n\n(MPa) \n\nMOE \n\n(MPa) \n\nSE \n\n(J/m2) \n\nCarbonation UB vs. UB-SC-48-2 + - + - - - 0 \n\nCarbonation UB vs. UB-SC-24-2 0 - + - - - 0 \n\nCarbonation B vs. B-SC-48-1 + - + - - - - \n\nCarbonation B vs. B-SC-48-2 + - + - - - - \n\nCarbonation \nB-AAC vs. B-SC-48-2-\n\nAAC \n0 - + - 0 - - \n\n                 \n\nHydration time \nUB-SC-48-2 vs. UB-SC-\n\n24-2 \n- 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n\n         \n\nCarbonation time \nB-SC-48-1 vs. B-SC-48-\n\n2 \n+ 0 + 0 0 0 0 \n\n         \n\nCellulosic Pulp UB vs. B 0 - 0 - - 0 0 \n\nCellulosic Pulp \nUB-SC-48-2 vs. B-SC-\n\n48-2 \n0 + 0 - - - - \n\n         \n\nAgeing cycles B vs. B-AAC + 0 + + 0 - + \n\nAgeing cycles \nB-SC-48-2 vs. B-SC-48-\n\n2-AAC \n+ - + +  - + \n\n* 0 no statistically significant difference between the average  \n\n** + statistically significant difference with a higher average for the first listed regime \n\n*** - statistically significant difference with a lower average for the first listed regime \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe effect of Exposure to Carbonation Curing:  The supercritical carbonation at early stages \n\nin the curing process resulted in many improvements to the mechanical properties of cement \n\ncomposites, reinforced with both bleached and unbleached eucalyptus pulp.

In these previous studies, the mechanical improvement was attributed \n\nto the elimination of calcium hydroxide due to the carbonation treatment (PIZZOL et al., 2014).    \n\nThe production of calcium carbonate during carbonation results in a better connected cement \n\nfiber matrix with fewer voids, responsible for the added strength and stiffness of the material. \n\nObservations showed that the major product formed for supercritically carbonated samples was \n\ncalcium carbonate (Calcite). This product fills the voids in the cement matrix increasing bulk \n\ndensity, stiffness and strength, while decreasing the apparent void volume (AVV); these effects \n\nare a result of calcium carbonate's higher density than calcium hydroxide.  \n\nThe effect of Hydration time: Samples UB-SC-48-2 vs. UB-SC-24-2 compared the effect of \n\nincreasing the thermal hydration time from 24 h to 48 h, the statistically significant difference \n\nshows that the change had no effect on specimen\u2019s bulk density, water adsorption, modulus of \n\nrupture, modulus of elasticity or specific energy. So, it would seem the initial 24 h of thermal \n\ncuring yields a substantial amount of hydration products, enough so as to not limit the \n\ncarbonation process, because once carbon dioxide dissolves and reacts with hydration products \n\n(CH and C\u2013S\u2013H) or with anhydrous phases (C3S and C2S), it forms CaCO3 by the combination \n\nof moist CO2 with Ca\n2+ (FERNANADEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004; ROSTAMI et al., 2012; \n\nALMEIDA et al., 2013). \n\nHowever, the AVV was affected, a short thermal hydration time (24 h) resulted in a higher \n\nAVV for UB-SC-24-2. The difference of AVV is due to the progression of the hydration process \n\n(TONOLI et al., 2009). There are many aspects that can influence the reaction kinetics and the \n\namounts of the hydrated phases produced (MURAT, 1983; TAHA et al., 1985; SILVA et al., \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\n1990). The most important one is the curing temperature, because it influences the stability and \n\nthe transformation of the hydrates (ROJAS et al., 2002). The AVV values decreased with longer \n\ndurations of thermal curing (between UB-SC-48-2 and UB-SC-24-2).  \n\nThe effect of Carbonation time: Samples B-SC-48-1 vs. B-SC-48-2, compared the effect of \n\ndecreasing the carbonation time from 2 h to 1 h, the statistically significant difference shows \n\nthat the variation had no effect on specimen\u2019s bulk density, modulus of rupture, modulus of \n\nelasticity and specific energy. Santos et al. (2015) proposed 2 h for the whole accelerated \n\nsupercritical carbonation process, the first hour to reach the equilibrium treatment and the \n\nsecond hour to extend the treatment after achieving the equilibrium treatment conditions. Due \n\nto the negligible difference between 1 h and 2 h (Table 14), it would appear that for guaranteed \n\nimprovement to the mechanical properties of the composites, the accelerated supercritical \n\ncarbonation process can be 1 h of treatment, the first hour when equilibrium conditions are \n\nreached. \n\nThe effect of cellulosic Pulp: Samples created with the unbleached pulp had lower average \n\nvalues of mechanical properties than their bleached pulp counterparts having undergone the \n\nsame curing process, as shown in Figure 16 which describes the typical stress x strain curves \n\nof the two kinds of composites. The comparison between carbonated samples UB-SC-48-2 vs. \n\nB-SC-48-2 resulted in average values of MOR, LOP, MOE, and SE that were 24%, 24%, 27% \n\nand 25% higher for the bleached pulp samples. This is due in part to the lignin content difference \n\nbetween the types of fibers. The bleached cellulose fiber used in this study was subjected to an \n\noxygen delignification process (MANOIR et al., 1993), which is a removal of: 92-95% of lignin \n\nfrom wood, the residual lignin (hexenuronic acid groups and extractives), and a destruction of \n\nchromophores (SJ\u00d6STR\u00d6M, 1993; DENCE AND REEVE, 1996), which are the amorphous \n\ncomponents of the fiber (DENCE AND REEVE, 1996; CORREIA et al., 2016). The bleached \n\nfibers with higher crystallinity and lower amounts of phenolic polymer, resulted in an increased \n\nstiffness and embrittlement of the fiber (WEI AND MEYER, 2015). This argument is reiterated \n\nby numerous authors with similar results, that the degree of crystallinity influences the physical \n\nand mechanical properties of the fibers (STURCOVA et al, 2005), particularly the elastic \n\nmodulus (CHEN et al., 2012). Also, inside microfibrils of the pulp the cellulose networks could \n\nhave an organized structure and increased crystallinity (CORREIA et al., 2014). The degree of \n\ncrystallinity and the organized structure could be influence the effect of carbonation process in \n\nbleached pulp fiber-cement composite with higher tensile strength, void content and interfacial \n\nadhesion of the composite.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nThe amorphous regions in cellulose are weaker due to hydrophobic properties, reagent attacks \n\nand the enzymes, this requires investigations on the use of amorphous samples, understanding \n\nthe thermal, chemical and mechanical behavior in crystal regions (LENGOWSKI et al., 2013). \n\nWhen vegetal fibers are exposed to chemical treatments that result in significant hydrolysis, \n\noxidation, dehydration reactions, etc. (SAHA et al., 2012; PITARELO, 2013) or mechanical \n\ntreatments, the crystallinity of cellulose could be altered (MEJIA et al., 2015). In alkaline \n\ncementitious matrices, the amorphous regions protect the fiber from the attack, but when the \n\npH of the composite is reduced, the amorphous areas do not work as well as those of a fiber \n\nthat has a higher crystallinity. Which average the degree of crystallinity of the natural fiber \n\ninfluences the improvement of the mechanical behavior of a cementitious composite subjected \n\nto carbonation.       \n\nThe comparison between uncarbonated samples UB vs. B indicated the toughness and Bulk \n\nDensity of B was statistically higher than that of UB. The B samples tended to have higher bulk \n\ndensity, but lower AVV and WA than the UB samples. Alkaline attacks occur in both types of \n\nsamples, resulting in mineralization that is caused by diffusion and precipitation of minerals \n\nrich in Ca. The literature indicates that the lignin, hemicelluloses, and pectin act as chemical \n\nand physical walls to the penetration of Ca2+ ions into the fibers (TONOLI et al., 2010). The \n\nbleached pulp has higher crystallinity and fewer amorphous components, which resulted on a \n\nstronger fiber-cement interface and a fewer barriers to the precipitation of Ca2+ ions, it other \n\nwords the mineralization process.    \n\nEffect of Accelerating Ageing Cycles:  The superior performance of carbonated samples \n\npersisted after 200 cycles of accelerated aging, with MOE of B-SC-48-2-AAC and B-AAC \n\nsamples presenting 17% to 30% higher average values than aged B-SC-48-2 and B samples. \n\nAdditionally, after accelerated aging, the average values of specific energy for the carbonated \n\nand uncarbonated composites decreased approximately 62% and 87%, respectively. Figure 17 \n\nshows typical stress x strain curves during flexural tests of the composites reinforced with \n\nbleached pulp before and after accelerated ageing cycles. \n\nThe physical properties of accelerated aging cycles were similar to those of the carbonation \n\nprocess, but with milder changes in bulk density which only increased by 5% after aging. This \n\nis a result of the aging process, during which CO2 causes the precipitation of calcium carbonate, \n\nbut also because of the greater duration over which hydration can occur and produce hydration \n\nproducts that fill the cement-fiber matrix.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n78 \n\n \n\nThe supercritical carbonation treatment helped diminish the annihilation of macromolecular \n\nchains during the partial alkaline hydrolysis of the cellulose, which causes their rupture and the \n\nconsequent reduction to the degree of polymerization. During soak and dry cycles, the fibers\u2019 \n\nnatural degradation occurs as the movement of the pore water towards the surface of the fibers \n\nis facilitated (SANTOS et al., 2015). \n\nFigure 16 - Typical stress x strain curves during flexure tests of the composites reinforced \n\nwith unbleached and bleached pulp. \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n79 \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - Typical stress x strain curves during flexure tests of the composites reinforced \n\nwith bleached pulp before and after accelerated ageing cycles. \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n4.1.2. Thermogravimetric analysis \n\nFigure 18 depicts the mass loss (TG) and differential mass loss (DTG) of the different curing \n\nprocesses. The changes in the mass loss between 90 and 200\u00b0C corresponds to the C\u2013S\u2013H, \n\nettringite (Aft), monosulfoaluminate (AFm) and monocarboaluminate (Mc). The mass loss in \n\nthe range of 200 to 420\u00b0C corresponds to C3A and C4AF hydration products\n \n\n(RAMACHANDRAN et al., 2001; SHA et al., 1999). Moreover, if water is more determinedly \n\nbonded in the C\u2013S\u2013H, it is even likely that some C\u2013S\u2013H dehydration will occur up to 300\u00b0C \n\n(RAMACHANDRAN et al., 1971). The most important hydration product of cement based \n\nmaterials is calcium silicate hydrate (C\u2013S\u2013H) gel (SANTOS et al., 2015; JENNINGS et al., \n\n2008; CHEN et al.,2004). The solid phase containing Ca2+ also contributes to calcite formation\n \n\n(GARCIA-GONZALEZ et al., 2008), promoted by the accelerated carbonation through the \n\nadsorption of the CO2 by the cementitious matrix, as was also observed by Pizzol et al. (2014) \n\nand Almeida et al. (2013) under different curing conditions. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\nThe researchers Bentur and Mindess (2007) noted that the cellulose phase in fiber-cement \n\ncomposites can be detected in the temperature interval between 295 and 370\u00b0C, corresponding \n\nto the degradation of the cellulose fibers. Figure 18 shows peaks at 340\u00b0C for UB and B \n\nsamples, and at 350\u00b0C for UB-SC-48-2 and B-SC-48-2. For AAC samples it is possible to see \n\nan increase to mass loss at 360\u00b0C for B-AAC and B-SC-48-2-AAC conditions when compared \n\nto unaged samples, indicating the degradation of the cellulose fibers due to exposure to aged \n\ncycles. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\n  Figure 18 \u2013 DTG results of the fiber-cement composites with different curing \n\nconditions of (a) unbleached samples and (b) bleached samples. \n\n  \n\nSource: authorships. \n\nAccording to Shaaban (1991), approximately 30% of Ca(OH)2 has potential to be carbonated \n\nduring CO2 exposure in controlled environmental chambers. The estimated amount of mass loss \n\nof calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (CH) and calcium carbonate CaCO3 (CC) is calculated \n\nfollowing the procedure proposed by Borges et al. (2010) using the equations (14) and (15), \n\nwhich, considering increased molecular mass resulting from the carbonation process, as shown \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n82 \n\n \n\nin Table 15, would suggest an increase to the percentage of mass lost, confirmed in the \n\nthermogravimetric data (DTG) presented in Figure 18. Dehydroxylation, L1, occurs between \n\n450 and 500\u00b0C, the mass loss in this range decreases as the carbonation exposure time increases, \n\nand decarbonation losses, L2, occurs between 600\u2013750\u00b0C. The initial amount of Ca(OH)2 may \n\nbe directly calculated from Eq. (16). The corresponding amount of CaCO3 resulting from the \n\ntotal Ca(OH)2 that carbonated was estimated using Eq.

It is apparent that the effect of hydration time, \n\nthe effect of carbonation exposure, and the effect of the cellulose pulp, did not influence the \n\nCa(OH)2 and CaCO3 formation.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\nFor the specimen submitted to 200 accelerated soak and dry aging cycles and carbonation (B-\n\nSC-48-2-AAC), the results suggest an increase of calcium hydroxide and reduction of calcium \n\ncarbonate compared with non-aged and carbonated samples (B-SC-48-2), for example at 476\u00b0C \n\n(Figure 18b) it is possible to estimate the amounts of Ca(OH)2 to be 4.5% and 0.57%, \n\nrespectively. On the other hand, at 830\u00b0C estimated amounts of CaCO3 for the same conditions \n\nwere 36,11% and 41,58%. This could be attributed to progress of hydration process of the \n\ncement.  \n\nHence, the supercritical accelerated carbonation increased the mass loss between 650 and \n\n750\u00b0C related to the decomposition of poorly crystalized CaCO3, as well as between 750 and \n\n850\u00b0C related to the decomposition of well-crystalized CaCO3, as reported by Rostami et al. \n\n(2012) and Pizzol et al. (2014). In all samples subjected to the carbonation regime, weight loss \n\nwas observed at approx. 800\u00b0C which represents well-crystallized CaCO3.   \n\n According to Alvarez and Abanades (2005), the carbonation process of calcium hydroxide can \n\ngenerate carbonate polymorphs to be oxidized in the same temperature range, which explains \n\nthe presence of a large peak around 830\u00b0C.  \n\n \n\n4.1.3. X-ray diffraction analysis \n\nThe XRD results shown in Figure 19 present the patterns for the eight sets of curing regimes.  \n\nCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the main mineralogical phase observed and the second phase is \n\ncalcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). \n\nFour phases of calcium carbonate occur with increasing stability, amorphous calcium carbonate, \n\nvaterite, aragonite, and calcite (BLACK et al., 2007). In Figure 19, it is possible to observe the \n\nincrease of the peak at 2? = 29.5\u00b0 in supercritically carbonated samples (UB-SC-48-2, UB-SC-\n\n24-2, B-SC-48-1, B-SC-48-2 and B-SC-48-2-AAC).  This corresponds to CaCO3 in the form \n\nof calcite (HUNNICUT, 2013), this increase is due to the primary reaction process of CO2 that \n\ndissolves into the matrix and reacts with hydration products, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) \n\nand calcium silicate hydrate (C\u2013S\u2013H), and also reacts with polymerized silica gel leading to \n\nsecondary carbonation.  \n\nFigure 19 compares the uncarbonated samples (UB, B and B-AAC) vs supercritical carbonated \n\nsamples (UB-SC-48-2, UB-SC-24-2, B-SC-48-1, B-SC-48-2 and B-SC-48-2-AAC), there is a \n\nnoticeable reduction of portlandite (around 2? = 18\u00b0 or 35\u00b0) according to Pizzol et al. (2014) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n84 \n\n \n\nand Santos et al. (2015).  The carbonation reactions and effects are the same as those described \n\nin the previous section for bleached and unbleached pulp samples.   \n\nInternational Centre Diffraction Data (2003) and PANalytical HighScore Plus Inorganic Crystal \n\nStructure Database (2007) were applied to identify crystalline phases. The PANalytical \n\nHighScore Plus was used too for made a quantification estimative of the clinker phases, \n\nconsidering only the crystalline part of the material and excluding the amorphous part.   \n\nFigure 19 \u2013 XRD patterns for UB, UB-SC-48-2, UB-SC-24-2, B, B-SC-48-1, B-SC-48-2, B-\n\nAAC and B-SC-48-2-AAC.

Evaluation of the changes in the microstructure \n\nFigures 20 and 21 present micrographs that were obtained by a SEM in Back-Scatter Electron \n\nmode (BSE) image detector operating at approximately 15.0 kV. The electron scattering is \n\nrelated to the atomic number.   \n\nPrevious studies have shown that accelerated carbonation enhanced the interface between \n\ncellulose and the cementitious matrix (PIZZOL et al., 2014; ALMEIDA  et al., 2013), which \n\ndevelops good mechanical anchorage and interlocking effects since carbonated composites are \n\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n2?\n\nUB\n\nUB-SC-48-2\n\nUB-SC-24-2\n\nB\n\nB-SC-48-1\n\nB-SC-24-2\n\nB-AAC\n\nB-SC-48-2-AAC\n\n1 Calcite \n\n2 Portlandite\n\n2 2                                        2  1\n1  1               1        1   1                                                                                     \n\n1\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\ndenser and more compact, due to calcite filling the pores of the system (PIZZOL et al., 2014). \n\nCarbonated composites micrographs emphasize the difference between cellulose pulp at the \n\nadhesion fibers-matrix.  Arrow 1 in Figure 20 shows the cracks and pores observed in the \n\ncement matrix surrounding the unbleached cellulose fibers; as a result, during mechanical \n\ntesting, the deficient fiber-matrix interface is linked to weaker mechanical properties \n\n(SAVASTANO et al., 2003; SAVASTANO et al., 2005). The carbonation process is \n\naccompanied with a reduction to the pH of the matrix, although the accelerated carbonation did \n\nnot avoid the mineralization process inside the cellulose fibers, as shown by arrow 2 in Figure \n\n20. \n\nThe carbonated composite shows unbleached cellulose fiber agglomeration (arrow 3 in Figure \n\n20). On the other hand, the bleached fibers in the carbonated composites had improved fiber\u2013\n\nmatrix interfaces with the cellulose when compared to the unbleached fibers (Arrow 4 in Figure \n\n21 compared to arrow 1 in Figure 20). Nevertheless, bleached fiber presents the mineralization \n\nprocess inside the cellulose fibers, as shown by arrow 5 in Figure 21. Homogeneous distribution \n\nof the of eucalyptus fibers over the matrix is noted by arrow 6 on Figure 21.  In summary, the \n\ncarbonated bleached fiber-reinforced composites presented better fiber distribution, improved \n\nfiber-matrix adhesion and mechanical behavior, than carbonated unbleached fiber-reinforced \n\ncomposites.   \n\nFigure 20 - SEM/BSE micrographs of the cut and polished surface of carbonated unbleached \n\nnatural fiber-cement composite.

Comparing the four curing \n\nregimes, as shown in Table 18, the effect of the mineral addition on the samples P-LAC-24 vs. \n\nP-AC-24 had an effect on the specimen\u2019s, resulted in average values of MOR, LOP, MOE, and \n\nSE of the composition of the silica were 24%, 46%, 25% and 32%. This could be attributed to \n\nthe difference in enhancing the hydration of the clinker as a result of the mineral addition effect; \n\nthe fine particle size distribution of the limestone, influence on the chemistry or the packing \n\n(HAWKINS et al., 2003), as well to be high affinity between calcium aluminate and carbonate \n\nphases to form monocarbonate (FELDMAN et al. 1965; BENSTED, 1980). The performance \n\nof limestone-cementitious materials is impacted by all main aggressive species (sulfates, \n\nchlorides, carbonation) and main pathologies (freezing-thawing, ASR, corrosion). On the other \n\nhand, the use of silica particles to substitute clinker particles, led to more available space for \n\nthe hydrates of the clinker phases to form, and it is considering for the heterogeneous \n\nprecipitation and growth of hydrates (SCRIVENER et al., 2015) and as an inner mineral \n\naddition it seems that there is almost no influence on the heat evolution curve during the \n\nacceleration period (LOTHENBACH et al., 2011). In both cementitious matrices, the presence \n\nof CO2 during the curing period (early carbonation) led to disappearing of calcium hydroxide \n\n(portlandite\u2014P). The CH and C\u2013S\u2013H become carbonated simultaneously. The initial rate of \n\ncarbonation is quite similar, but while C\u2013S\u2013H is still carbonating, CH carbonation slows down \n\nand stops. This is due to the fact that CH becomes less and more accessible for carbonation \n\nfront (MORANDEAU et al., 2014; TONOLI et al., 2016).  \n\nEffect of Hydration Time:  To compare the effect of the carbonation curing phase on the \n\nspecimens, a comparison of the properties of the following curing regimes was examined:  P-\n\nLAC-10 vs. P-LAC-24 and P-AC-10 vs. P-AC-24. Comparing the four curing regimes, as \n\nshown in Table 18, increasing the hydration time from 10 h to 24 h had no effect on the \n\nspecimen\u2019s bulk density, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 - Typical stress x strain curves during flexural tests of the composites using \n\nLimestone and Silica as mineral addition.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n \n\n4.2.2. X-ray diffraction analysis \n\nFigure 23 presents the XRD patterns for the four different sets of curing and formulations \n\nconditions. Calcium carbonate (calcite) is the main mineralogical phase observed in the \n\ncarbonated samples due to the presence of the calcium carbonate, the second phase is calcium \n\nhydroxide (Portlandite) observed at a much lower rate. Figure 23 compares the carbonated \n\nsamples using different mineral additions, Limestone (P-LAC-10 and P-LAC-24) vs Silica (P-\n\nAC-10 and P-AC-24). There is a noticeable absence of portlandite (around 2? = 18\u00b0 or 36\u00b0) and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\nthe notorious peak around 2? = 26.6\u00b0, correspond to the silica type quartz, in the samples with \n\nsilica mineral addition.  \n\nIn Figure 23, it is possible to observe the increase of the peak at 2? = 29.5\u00b0 in all carbonated \n\nsamples. This corresponds to CaCO3 in the form of calcite (TONOLI et al., 2016), this increase \n\nis due to the primary reaction process of CO2 that dissolves into the matrix and reacts with \n\nhydration products, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) and calcium silicate hydrate (C\u2013S\u2013H), and \n\nalso reacts with polymerized silica gel leading to secondary carbonation.  \n\nFigure 23 - XRD patterns of the sets of curing regimes.

The estimated percentages correspond to the crystalline percent of the material and did \n\nnot take into account the amorphous percent of the material.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\nThe percent quantification and formation of each one those phases on limestone composites \n\nsubjected to carbonation curing depends mostly on two main chemical processes: primarily the \n\ndissolution of Ca(OH)2, which releases Ca\n2+ and OH- ions, and precipitates forming calcium \n\ncarbonate (CaCO3). Even though the carbonation process reduces the amount of portlandite, \n\nthis phase was not completely consumed in the limestone composite, as shown in Figure 24, \n\nnevertheless the principal component, with significantly greater quantities, is calcium \n\ncarbonate. Secondly, the calcium carbonate formation is attributed to the reduction of Ca/Si in \n\ncalcium silicate hydrate gel, as well from other solid phases containing Ca2+. The progressive \n\ndecalcification ultimately leads to S\u2013H and CaCO3. This reaction process between CO2 and the \n\nC\u2013S\u2013H produces CaCO3 and a polymerised silica gel (SANTOS et al., 2015; FERNANDEZ-\n\nBERTOS et al., 2004).  \n\nFigure 24 - XRD patterns of quantification of the phases for Limestone Composite P-LAC-24.  \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\nFigure 25 shows estimated percentages of calcium hydroxide (Portlandite), calcium carbonate \n\n(Calcite), tricalcium silicate (alite), dicalcium silicate (belita) and quartz, also determined using \n\nthe software PANalytical HighScore Plus. As was previously mentioned, these estimated \n\npercentages correspond to the phases of crystalline amount of the material and did not take into \n\naccount the amorphous amount of the material.  \n\nIn this case, the principal component of the matrix is the quartz, instead of CaCO3. The presence \n\nof quartz (SiO2) is due to the inert mineral addition used, silica. In this composite, it is \n\nconsidered the total reduction of portlandite, because it is around 3%, clarify that is the percent \n\ncorrespond to the quantification of the crystalline part of the composite.

Evaluation of the changes in the microstructure \n\nFigure 26 and Figure 27 presents micrographs that were obtained using a SEM in Back-Scatter \n\nElectron mode (BSE) image detector operating at approximately 15.0 kV. Both images \n\ncorrespond to carbonated cementitious matrices, which average they are denser and more \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\ncompact, and have improved contact between cellulosic fibers and the cement matrix, when \n\ncompared to uncarbonated cementitious matrices (SAVASTANO AND AGOPYAN, 1999). \n\nThe EDS analysis allows to see the differences between these composites, which are the \n\nchemical components; on limestone composites, it is well known and previously discussed that \n\nthe porosity is sufficiently high to permit constant CO2 diffusion, therefore the CH is further \n\nreduced and the interlayer calcium from C\u2013S\u2013H also reacts with carbon dioxide, as a result the \n\nmain composite is CaCO3 and secondary composite is silicate gel (FERN\u00c1NDEZ-BERTOS et \n\nal., 2004). (Fig. 26 and Fig. 27) In both cases the microstructure is compact and formed by \n\nlayered structures, (cross1 in Fig. 26 and Fig. 27) likely related to the C\u2013S\u2013H phases. These \n\nresults corroborate with the higher content of CaCO3 (cross 2 in Fig. 26), observed in the XRD \n\nquantification of the crystalline part of the limestone material. Across 3, Fig. 27 presents the \n\nmain component of this composite that is the quartz.   \n\nFigure 26 - a) SEM image. b) EDS analysis of limestone composite.

By analyzing the physical and \n\nmechanical property results for the eight curing regimes we can isolate the influence of \n\nhydration time (10 h vs. 24 h); carbonation processes (atmospheric CO2 level (0.035%) vs. 20% \n\nCO2); and also the degradation performance by way of exposure to accelerated ageing (soak-\n\ndry) cycles (no cycles vs. 200 cycles). To evaluate the effect of the hydration time duration on \n\nthe properties of the matrix, the following comparisons are assessed: P-UC-10 vs. P-UC-24; P-\n\nAC-10 vs P-AC-24; P-UC-10-AAC vs. P-UC-24-AAC; and P-AC-10-AAC vs. P-AC-24-AAC. \n\nA summary of the statistical significance testing is reported in Table 20 for the physical and \n\nmechanical properties.

Considering eight curing regimes as shown in Table 19, the effect of \n\nincreasing the hydration time from 10 h to 24 h had no effect on the specimen\u2019s bulk density, \n\nmodulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity. However, when comparing specimens subjected \n\nto the accelerated ageing cycles, the limit of proportionally was affected, whereby, a longer \n\nhydration time (24 h) resulted in a higher LOP for both the uncarbonated (P-UC-10-AAC and \n\nP-UC-24-AAC) specimens, as well as the carbonated specimens (P-AC-10-AAC and P-AC-\n\n24-AAC). The difference of LOP could be due to the progression of the hydration process \n\n(TONOLI et a., 2009). Another factor that could influence the initial hydration duration time \n\nwas the mineral addition effect, in this case the silica, allows the heterogeneous precipitation \n\nand growth of hydrates (SCRIVENER et al., 2015).  \n\n \n\nEffect of Exposure to Carbonation Curing:  To evaluate the effect of the carbonation curing \n\nphase on the specimens a comparison of the properties of the following curing regimes is \n\nexamined:  P-UC-10 vs. P-AC-10; P-UC-24 vs. P-AC-24; P-UC-10-AAC vs. P-AC-10-AAC; \n\nand P-UC-24-AAC vs. P-AC-24-AAC. Examination of the measurements in Table 19 reveals \n\nthat for all specimens, exposure to carbonation curing increased the mechanical properties, \n\nnamely, the modulus of rupture, limit of proportionality and the modulus of elasticity, compared \n\nto the specimens that were not subjected to carbonation.  For the case of specimens without \n\nexposure to the accelerated ageing cycles, the statistical analysis reveals that the high \n\nconcentration of CO2 (20%) exposure resulted in a statistically significant difference in all \n\nphysical and mechanical properties.  The average values of LOP and MOE show indirectly that \n\nthere is an improvement in the fibre-matrix interface caused by carbonation processes in the \n\nearly stage of curing, and furthermore, after exposure to 200 soak-dry cycles. Almeida et al. \n\n(2010) and Pizzol et al. (2014) studied cement based specimens reinforced with eucalyptus \n\ncellulosic pulp subjected to accelerated carbonation curing (AC) resulting in an increase of \n\nmatrix resistance to the crack propagation, if compared to uncarbonated fibre\u2013cement. The \n\nmechanical improvement was attributed to the elimination of calcium hydroxide due to the \n\ncarbonation treatment, that creates a microstructure with more strength-contributing solids than \n\nconventional hydration (PIZZOL et al., 2014; ROSTAMI et al., 2012; ALMEIDA et al., 2013). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n100 \n\n \n\nSpecimens of carbonated specimens (AC) were compared to the uncarbonated (UC) specimens \n\nafter they were exposed to the accelerated ageing cycles. The specimens P-UC-10-AAC and P-\n\nUC-24-AAC have greater mean apparent porosity values, and lower mechanical performance \n\ncompared to P-AC-10-AAC and P-AC-24-AAC respectively. CaCO3 is precipitated in the pore \n\nstructure of the composite, filling the voids and through blocking the absorption of water due \n\nto the decrease of pore size (HYVERT et al., 2010). \n\nAccording with Santos et al. (2015), the fibre-matrix interactions are dependent on physical and \n\nchemical adhesion, shear stress resistance and mechanical anchorage induced by overall \n\ncomplex geometry and orientation effects of the cellulosic fibres. Unbleached pine fibre is low \n\ndensity and hydrophilic. Therefore, the amount of water absorbed by this fibre depends on the \n\nvoid volume and the amount of cellulose material present; both parameters have an effect upon \n\ndensity of the matrix (COUTTS, 1995).   \n\nEffect of Accelerating Ageing Cycles:  To evaluate the effect of the accelerated ageing soak-\n\ndry cycles on the properties of the specimens, the following curing regimes are compared: P-\n\nUC-10 vs. P-UC-10-AAC; P-UC-24 vs. P-UC-24-AAC; P-AC-10 vs. P-AC-10-AAC; and P-\n\nAC-24 vs. P-AC-24-AAC.  No clear trends are apparent when examining the average \n\nmechanical properties or physical properties of specimens subjected to 200 soak-dry cycles \n\ncompared to specimens that were not submitted to the aging cycles.  In some cases, the \n\nmechanical properties are greater for the specimens subjected to the accelerated ageing cycles, \n\nbut in other cases they are not.  In some cases, the difference of the mean properties between \n\nsamples exposed and not exposed to 200 soak-dry cycles is statistically significantly different, \n\nbut in other cases it is not, as shown in Table 20. However, close examination of the data in \n\nTable 20, representing the physical and mechanical properties, reveals that the vegetable fibre \n\n-cement composite can exhibit good durability properties even after being subjected to 200 \n\nsoak-dry ageing cycles. For example, the range in modulus of rupture of samples not exposed \n\nto any ageing cycles compared to those exposed to 200 ageing cycles is 6.49 to 10.9 MPa, and \n\n6.17 to 9.39 MPa respectively. The range in limit of proportionality of samples not exposed to \n\nany ageing cycles compared to those exposed to 200 ageing cycles is 2.84 to 5.19 MPa, and \n\n3.76 to 6.51 MPa respectively. The range in the elastic modulus of samples exposed to no ageing \n\ncycles compared to those exposed to 200 ageing cycles is 7022 to 10325 MPa, and 8705 to \n\n11936 MPa respectively.  Therefore, it is clear, the range in mechanical properties of specimens \n\nexposed to accelerated soak-dry cycles is within a similar range as that of the specimens that \n\nhave not been subjected to any soak-dry cycles. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n101 \n\n \n\nThe accelerated carbonation treatment interferes with the reduce of the destruction \n\nmacromolecular chains during the partial alkaline hydrolysis of the cellulose, which causes their \n\nrupture and the consequent decrease in the degree of polymerisation. Also, this treatment is a \n\ngradual process of filling up the inner cores of the vegetable fibres with the hydration products \n\nthat leads to the embrittlement of the reinforcement (MELO FILHO et al., 2013). Furthermore, \n\na it was proposed that on carbonated composites the toughening mechanisms were better \n\npreserved the fracture process (SANTOS et al., 2015). Nevertheless, judging by the results of \n\nboth composites, carbonated and uncarbonated, was found that the mechanical properties were \n\nmaintained and this could be attribute to the use of an inert filler in the cementitious matrix.  \n\nThe use of an inert mineral addition as ground silica allows to isolate the effect of the \n\naccelerated carbonation curing process on cementitious composites, but it also seems to work \n\nas appropriate strategy to mitigate degradation of the composite, even for air curing (with no \n\nautoclave) condition. In conjunction with the use of unbleached pine fiber, it works for the good \n\ninterfacial fibre-matrix bonding strength and lower vulnerability of the fiber for degradation in \n\nthe cement matrix (COOKE, 2000; SANTOS et al., 2015). The typical stress x strain curves of \n\nthe composites are shown at Figure 28 before and after accelerated ageing cycles for 10 h of \n\ninitial hydration; and Figure 29 before and after accelerated ageing cycles for 24 h of initial \n\nhydration. Comparing specimens subjected to the accelerated ageing cycles, the specific energy \n\naffected, whereby, a longer hydration time (24 h) resulted in a higher SE for the carbonated \n\nspecimens (P-AC-24-AAC); but a short hydration time (10 h) resulted in a higher MOR for the \n\ncarbonated specimen (P-AC-10-AAC) \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n102 \n\n \n\nFigure 28 - Typical stress x strain curves during flexure tests of the composites reinforced \n\nbefore and after accelerated aging cycles.

Thermogravimetry analysis (TG/DTG)  \n\nThe comparison of the mechanical properties of the uncarbonated and carbonated samples \n\nbefore and after accelerated aging cycles shows statistically significant improvement of the \n\ncarbonated samples due to the carbonation reaction. The efficiency of the carbonation reaction \n\nwas evaluated for the eight sets of curing regimes, through the differential thermogravimetry \n\nanalysis (DTG).   \n\nThe most important hydration product of cementitious composites is still calcium silicate \n\nhydrate (C\u2013S\u2013H) gel (CHEN et al., 2004; SHI et al., 2009) and it is responsible for most of the \n\nproperties of cement-based materials (SANTOS et al., 2015). For the carbonation process, the \n\ndissolution of Ca(OH)2 generally takes place more readily, while decalcification of C\u2013S\u2013H \n\noccurs when Ca(OH)2 is inaccessible or locally reduced (FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004), \n\nit is known as secondary carbonation process (FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004). On DTG \n\nFigure 30a and Figure 30b there is a clear difference between uncarbonated (UC) and \n\ncarbonated (AC) conditions; the AC conditions presents a lower mass loss between 0\u00b0C and \n\n240\u00b0C compared with the UC conditions, this is attributed to the formation of different phases. \n\nThe abrupt mass loss between 105 and 150\u00b0C is evident in the uncarbonated (UC) samples; the \n\nDTG curve indicates C-S-H and ettringite dehydration (RAMACHANDRAN et al., 2001). In \n\naddition, in the UC samples, a weight loss at approximately 180\u00b0C is observed, indicating the \n\npresence of monosulfate (LOTHENBACH et al., 2008). Also, the UC conditions presents a \n\nhigher mass loss between 105 and 420\u00b0C compared with the UC conditions, this range \n\nrepresents the loss of combined water due to dehydration of (C\u2013S\u2013H), aluminate hydrate and \n\nferroaluminate hydrate (RAMACHANDRAN et al., 2001; SHA et al., 1999; SHARMA et al., \n\n1999). \n\nBentur and Mindess (2007), observed that cellulose phase in fiber-cement composites  detected \n\nin the temperature interval 295 - 370\u00b0C corresponding to the degradation of the cellulose fibers. \n\nExposure of specimens to elevated levels of carbon dioxide is known to be one mechanism to \n\nminimize cellulose fibre degradation in the fibre-cement products. The beneficial effects on the \n\nmechanical and physical properties were apparently.  The mass loss in the range of 295 - 370\u00b0C \n\ncould be related to the degradation of the fibre as a result of the soak-dry cycles, in particular \n\nat 340\u00b0C for the specimen P-AC-10-AAC (Figure 30a) have a higher peak compare with P-AC-\n\n24-AAC (Figure 30b) at 350\u00b0C.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n104 \n\n \n\nOne potential mechanism of degradation which has been reported in the literature is the \n\nmineralization of the cellulose fibres, which is produced by the free ions from the dissolution \n\nof Portland cement phases that penetrate into the fibre cavity (lumen).  This is the principal \n\nreason for the re-precipitation of calcium hydroxide into the fibre. This re-precipitation of solids \n\ninto the fibre voids induces the embrittlement of the cellulose fibres (MOHR et al., 2005; \n\nMOHR et al., 2006). This influences significant losses in mechanical properties in the long-\n\nterm and has specifically been observed in vegetable fibre-cement composites after natural or \n\naccelerated ageing (e.g. soak/dry cycling), due to the degradation mechanisms of cellulose \n\nfibres in the cementitious environment (MOHR et al., 2005; TONOLI et al., 2009).  \n\nTable 21 presents the TG results by way of quantifying the mass loss percentage of carbonation \n\nprecipitate.  According with Borges et al. (2010), the increase in molar mass with carbonation \n\nprocess, allows inferring an increase in the percentage of mass lost. The amount of calcium \n\nhydroxide (CH) and calcium carbonate (CC) was determined using the molar mass balance, \n\nsince that 74 g/mol, 44 g/mol, 100 g/mol and 18 g/mol are the molar masses of Ca(OH)2, CO2, \n\nCaCO3 and H2O respectively. Using the method of Borges et al. (2010), withthe equations (14) \n\nand (15). Dehydroxylation, L1, occurs between 450 and 500\u00b0C, the mass loss in this range \n\ndecreases as the carbonation exposure time increases, and decarbonation losses, L2, occurs \n\nbetween 600\u2013750\u00b0C. The initial amount of Ca(OH)2 may be directly calculated from Eq. (16). \n\nThe corresponding amount of CaCO3 resulting from the total Ca(OH)2 that carbonated was \n\nestimated using Eq. (17). \n\n%CH = L1 ?\n74\n\n18\n= 4.11 ? L1        (Eq. 14) \n\n%CC = L2 ?\n100\n\n44\n= 2.27 ? L2         (Eq. 15) \n\n%CH Initial = %CH + (0.74 ? %??)              (Eq. 16) \n\n%CC = 1.35 ? %CH         (Eq. 17) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n105 \n\n \n\nFigure 30 -  DTG curves of the fibre\u2013cement specimens: a.) before and after ageing cycles for \n\n10 h initial hydration, and b.) before and after ageing cycles for 24 h initial hydration \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\nFrom Table 21 comparing the %CH and %CC between the uncarbonated and carbonated \n\nsamples with different initial hydration durations (10 h v. 24 h), it is apparent that the hydration \n\ntime did not influence the Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 formation. In all samples subjected to the \n\ncarbonation regime, it was observed weight loss at approximately 800\u00b0C, which represents \n\nwell-crystallized CaCO3.  According to Alvarez et al. (2005), this indicates that the carbonation \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n106 \n\n \n\nprocess of calcium hydroxide can generate carbonate polymorphs that may be oxidized in the \n\nsame region.  Considering the relatively weak peak located at 758\u00b0C of the uncarbonated \n\nsamples (P-UC-10 and P-UC-24) in Figure 30a, it suggests only the initial carbon content in as-\n\nreceived cement.  This observation is also supported by other researchers such as Rostami et al. \n\n(2011). \n\nFor the samples under accelerated carbonated conditions, it was observed a considerable \n\ndecrease in the peak at 470\u00b0C indicating the CH consumption due to carbonation, what can \n\nsurely contribute to the dimensional stabilization of the composite and to the alkalinity \n\nreduction of the cement matrix (PIZZOL et al., 2014). Contrarily, the uncarbonated samples \n\nshow a much greater peak at the same region, which infers a highly alkaline composite. The \n\nincrease or decrease of these peaks indicate the alkalinity of the matrix, as well as the reaction \n\nwith phenolphthalein on carbonated composites indicates the composite to be less alkaline. In \n\ncontrast, the phenolphthalein on the uncarbonated samples is measured to be more alkaline, \n\nwith a relatively above pH (8.5). \n\nTable 21 -  The estimation of the extent of carbonation of C\u2013S\u2013H from TGA data, before and \nafter accelerated carbonation treatment, non-aged and aged. \n\nCuring \n\nRegimes \n\nUncarbonated \n\ncomposite \n\nCuring \n\nRegimes \n\nCarbonated composite \n\n CH \n\nfrom \n\nTGA \n\n(%) \n\nCC \n\nfrom \n\nTGA \n\n(%) \n\nCalculation \n\nof \n\ninitial CH \n\n(%) \n\n CH \n\nfrom \n\nTGA \n\n(%) \n\nCC \n\nfrom \n\nTGA \n\n(%) \n\nAmount of \n\ncarbonated \n\nCH (%) \n\nExpected \n\nCC from \n\ncarbonating \n\nCH (%) \n\nCarbonates \n\nformed by \n\nC\u2013S\u2013H (%) \n\nP-UC-10 6.49 6.44 11.26 P-AC-10 1.35 21.2 9.9 13.37 7.78 \n\nP-UC-10-\n\nAAC 6.1 5.8 10.38 \n\nP-AC-10-\n\nAAC 1.93 24.3 8.45 11.41 12.85 \n\n          \n\nP-UC-24 7.35 4.15 10.43 P-AC-24 0.98 23.6 9.44 12.75 10.81 \n\nP-UC-24-\n\nAAC 5.79 4.74 13.21 \n\nP-AC-24-\n\nAAC 1.39 24.9 11.81 15.95 9.01 \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n \n\n4.3.3.

The results reveal that the calcium carbonate \n\nwas present in all carbonated samples. In both Figures 31 and 32, a band in the region of 1,300 \n\nto 1,700 cm-1 is observed, which some researchers have linked to carbonation processes \n\n(YLM\u00c9N et al., 2013). For the specimens, P-AC-10 and P-AC-10-AAC, presents peaks at 879, \n\n1085, 1427, 1794 and 2505 cm-1 can be observed in all of the spectra and were assigned to \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n107 \n\n \n\nCaCO3. In a CO2 rich atmosphere there is a noticeable decline in Ca(OH)2, seen as a dip at \n\n3,632 cm-1 in Fig. 31. For the specimen, P-AC-24-AAC (Figure 32), presents peaks at 884, \n\n1089, 1443, 1799 and 2505 cm-1 can be observed in all of the spectra and were assigned to \n\nCaCO3.  There is also a dip at 3,643 cm\n-1 due to a decreased amount of Ca(OH)2 in Fig. 32 the \n\nsample P-AC-24. (BJ\u00d6RNSTR\u00d6M, 2005; DELGADO et al., 1996; YU et al., 1999). In fibre\u2013\n\ncement with a reasonable amount of CH, the principal carbonation product is calcite from \n\nhigher carbonation rate of CH and C\u2013S\u2013H. (YLM\u00c9N et al., 2013, SANTOS et al., 2015).  \n\nThere is also a dip at *950\u20131,100 cm-1 corresponding to the peaks for C\u2013S\u2013H in all the samples \n\nspectrum in Figure 31 and Figure 32. Some transformations of sulfates appear to occur, \n\nemphasized by a shift in absorbance of the S\u2013O stretching between 1,100 and 1,200 cm-1. The \n\nspectrum of the product fits well with that of ettringite. In this experiment this was not observed \n\nsulfate phases, such as ettringite, this can be concluded because there are no observable \n\nsignatures of the calcium sulfate species, such as gypsum, formed as a byproduct of the \n\ncarbonation (GROUNDS et al., 1988; XIANTUO AND RUIZHEN, 1994). \n\nFigure 31 - FTIR patterns of 10 h initial hydration composite before and after accelerated \n\naging curing. \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n108 \n\n \n\nFigure 32 - FTIR patterns of 24 h initial hydration composite before and after accelerated \n\naging curing. \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n4.3.4. X-ray diffraction analysis \n\nThe XRD results shown in Figure 33 presents the patterns of the four sets of curing regimes \n\ncorrespond to 24 h of initial hydration. Through the XRD analysis, it was possible to identify \n\nthe main phases of the composite. Calcium carbonate (calcite) is the main mineralogical phase \n\nobserved in the uncarbonated samples due to the presence of the calcium carbonate, the second \n\nphase is calcium hydroxide (portlandite), third phase is quartz due to the mineral addition in the \n\ncomposition, the fourth is tricalcium silicate (alite) and the last one is dicalcium silicate (belita). \n\nThe remaining cement anhydrous phase, such as alite (C3S) and belite (C2S) are detected after \n\nseven days of thermal curing (Figure 33). Four phases of calcium carbonate can take place with \n\nincreasing stability, amorphous calcium carbonate, vaterite, aragonite, and calcite (BLACK et \n\nal., 2007). It is observed the reduction of the amorphous background (broad band between 2? \n\n= 25\u201340\u00b0C) from the uncarbonated to the carbonated composite, which means an increase of \n\nthe crystallinity of the phases. In Figure 33, it is possible to observe the increase of the peak 2? \n\n= 29.5\u00b0 in the conditions P-AC-24 and P-AC-24-AAC this corresponds to calcite, due the \n\nprimary reaction process of CO2 that dissolves into the matrix and reacts with hydration \n\nproducts, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) and calcium silicate hydrate (C\u2013S\u2013H), and also reacts \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n109 \n\n \n\nwith polymerized silica gel is known as secondary carbonation. Other CaCO3 polymorphs \n\n(vaterite\u2014Va and aragonite\u2014Ar) were not detected. \n\nThe uncarbonated samples (P-UC-24, and P-UC-24-AAC) presented a higher intensity in the \n\nregion of 2? = 18\u00b0 corresponding to the portlandite (calcium hydroxide) (ALMEIDA et al., \n\n2013). The carbonation process in the early stages of hydration resulted in the decrease of \n\nportlandite, as shown by the lower intensity of the characteristic peak of the carbonated samples. \n\nAnother important peak 2? = 26.6\u00b0, correspond to the silica type quartz.   \n\nFigure 33 - XRD patterns of the four sets of curing regimes. \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n \n\nThe figures 34 and 34 show the estimative amount of the identified phases, following it is \n\nmentioned a few global crystallographic parameters of each identified phase are: calcite \n\n(CaCO3), with reference cod 969009669, have a hexagonal crystallographic structure and the \n\nspace group number of R -3c (167) (SITEPU et al., 2005); the portlandita Ca(OH)2, with a \n\nreference cod 969000114, corresponds to hexagonal crystallographic structure and the space \n\ngroup number of P-3 m 1 (164) (HERNDERSON et al., 1962); the alite, with a reference cod \n\n990010019, compound name 1540705, correspond to monoclinic crystallographic system and \n\nthe space group number of C 1 m 1 (8) (DE LA TORRE et al., 2002); the belite, with a reference \n\ncod 969012790, correspond to monoclinic crystallographic system and the space group number \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n110 \n\n \n\nof P 1 21/c 1 (14) (TSURUMI et al., 1994); the quarzt, with a reference cod 962100189, \n\ncorresponds to hexagonal crystallographic structure and the space group number of P 31 2 1 \n\n(152) (CASPI et al., 2005).  \n\nFigure 34 and Figure 35 shows estimated percentages of calcium hydroxide (Portlandite), \n\ncalcium carbonate (Calcite), tricalcium silicate (alite), dicalcium silicate (belita) and quartz, \n\nwere determined using the software PANalytical HighScore Plus for the samples in the initial \n\nages P-UC-24 and P-AC-24, and after ageing P-UC-24-AAC and P-AC-24-AAC.  \n\nThese estimated percentages correspond to the crystalline content of the material and didn\u2019t \n\ntake into account the amorphous content of the material. The XRD patterns without (Figure \n\n34a) and after (Figure 34b) carbonation indicated at AC condition, the calcium hydroxide (CH) \n\nwas reduced 17.4% as well the belite was reduced 3.3%, these phases took part on the primary \n\nand secondary carbonation process, respectively (SANTOS et al., 2015; FERNANDEZ-\n\nBERTOS et al., 2004). A very similar situation was related with the increase of the calcite, \n\ncorresponding to 23%.  \n\nThese estimated percentages correspond to the crystalline amount of the material and didn\u2019t \n\ntake into account the amorphous content of the material. The XRD patterns of before (Figure \n\n35a) and after (Figure 35b) carbonation both after accelerated aging cycles indicates at AC \n\ncondition, the calcium hydroxide (CH) was reduce 18.5% as well the belite 2.5%, this phases \n\nmade part of the primary and secondary carbonation process, respectively (SANTOS et al., \n\n2015; FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004). In this case, the increase of the calcite corresponds \n\nto 31.7%.  \n\nIt is possible to compare the amount of CH of 19.2% (Figure 34a) and 21% (Figure 35a) with \n\n1.8% (Figure 34b) and 2.5% (Figure 35b), which is related to the decrease of alkalinity of the \n\nmatrix. In the XRD analysis, for a crystallinity quantification, it is considered that below of 3% \n\nit is not a significant percentage for an identified phase.  \n\nBy the other hand, in all the composites the main phase is the quartz and this phase presents a \n\nreduction on carbonated composites compared with uncarbonated ones. Also, the calcium \n\ncarbonate is not the principal phase on the carbonated samples but in the section 3.1, \n\nMechanical and physical properties, the carbonated composites present a statistically \n\nsignificantly better mechanical behavior than the uncarbonated composites. This improvement \n\ncould be attributed to the reduction of the alkalinity and the amount of calcium carbonate \n\nformatted during the accelerated curing process. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n111 \n\n \n\nFigure 34 - XRD patterns of quantification of the phases for: a) composite P-UC-24 and b) \n\ncomposite P-AC-24 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n112 \n\n \n\nFigure 35 - XRD patterns of quantification of the phases for: a) composite P-UC-24-AAC and \n\nb) composite P-AC-24-AAC \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n4.3.5. Microstructure of the composites by SEM \n\nMicrographs were obtained by a SEM in Back-Scattered Electron Image (BSEI) mode for the \n\nobservation of the morphological features of cut and polished surfaces of composites subjected \n\nto uncarbonated and early age carbonated composites, both after 200 accelerated aging cycles, \n\nP-UC-24 and P-AC-24 (Figure 36 a,b), P-UC-24-AAC and P-AC-24-AAC (Figure 37 a,b). All \n\nthe images have an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The SEM micrographs shown are typical \n\nimages of the microstructure chosen from around six representative images for each composite \n\ntreatment. \n\nFigure 36 depicts cracks (arrow 1) and a more porous matrix is observed in the uncarbonated \n\ncomposite, due the initial porosity of a fiber-cement matrix, especially because of the \n\nproduction by the slurry-dewatering and significant volume of fibers, which eases the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n113 \n\n \n\npenetration of CO2 in the composite (TONOLI et al., 2010). The cement matrix of the \n\ncarbonated composite is denser and compact (Figure 36b).  \n\n  The uncarbonated composite shows the heterogeneous and distribution of unbleached \n\ncellulose fiber (arrow 2 in Figure 36a).  Arrow 3 in Figure 36a presents cracks surrounding the \n\ncellulose fiber, which are the indicative of a weak contact between cellulose fibers and matrix. \n\nThe deficient fiber-matrix interface is linked to lower mechanical properties (SAVASTANO et \n\nal., 2003; SAVASTANO et al., 2005). However, some fibers in the uncarbonated composites \n\npresent good contact with the cement matrix (arrow 4 in Figure 36a), this could be attributed to \n\nthe use of an inert mineral addition, silica, have good packing effect due to the 28% of filler \n\nusing in the formulation. The accelerated carbonated process is refining the porosity of the \n\ncement matrix and improving the contact between cellulosic fibers and the matrix, and possibly \n\nfavoring the better adhesion between them (arrow 5 in Figure 36b) (PIZZOL et al., 2014). The \n\naccelerated carbonation did not avoid some mineralization inside of the cellulose fibers, as \n\nshown by arrow 6 in Figure 36b. \n\nFigure 37 shows the uncarbonated and carbonated composite both after accelerated ageing \n\ncycles. The water absorption of natural fiber has a direct influence on the reinforcing \n\nperformance and durability of the fiber in the cement matrix (WEI et al., 2015). At uncarbonated \n\nand aged composite, the fibers present creep, due the fibers absorb water, accompanied by \n\nvolume expansion, from the soak and drying cycles (arrow 7 in Figure 37a). Before and after \n\nthe aging cycles the uncarbonated composite depicts cracks and a more porous matrix than the \n\ncarbonated composite (arrow 8 in Figure 37a). At early ages in the carbonated composites it is \n\nobserved the improved fiber\u2013matrix interface of the cellulose fibers and the diminutive porosity \n\nat the interface between aggregate particles and cement matrix. According to Farahi et al. (2013) \n\nand Almeida et al. (2013) precipitation of the calcium carbonate during carbonation is formed \n\nfavorably at the aggregate-matrix interface, since this area is generally the most porous and thus \n\nweakest zone in the cement composites. After the aging cycles present some crack propagation \n\nin the carbonated composite (arrow 9 Figure 37b). However, most of the fibers do not present \n\nrupture (arrow 10 Figure 37b) it means that after the cycles, the energy is still absorbed by the \n\ncomposite due to the frictional slipping process during the pulling-out of fibers giving a good \n\ninterface with the matrix (FARAHI et al., 2013).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n114 \n\n \n\nFigure 36 - SEM BSEI of the composites in the early ages. a.)

Figure 38 shows \n\nthe composite before carbonation (P-UC-24), EDS analyses depict strong peaks of Ca and Si. \n\nThe high content of the selected elements indicates the presence of quartz (Fig. 38 b-1), typical \n\namorphous C\u2013S\u2013H (Figure 38 b-2), crystalline CH (Fig. 38 b-3) and CH into the fiber cavity \n\n(lumen) (Fig. 38 b-4) after complete seven days of thermal hydration process. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n115 \n\n \n\nFigure 39 shows the composite after carbonation (P-AC-24). Generally, the carbonated \n\ncomposite has finer texture compared to the uncarbonated sample (P-UC-24 in Fig. 38). While \n\nthe corresponding XRD pattern suggests formation of carbon products, the SEM picture does \n\nnot provide any evidence of the crystalline form of carbonates. However, it is observed \n\nrelatively high carbon content can be distinguished into the fiber cavity (lumen) based on the \n\nEnergy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) spot analysis (Fig. 39 b-4). The biggest amount of \n\ncarbon in fiber cavity correspond to the main element of the organic constitution of the fiber.  \n\nThe EDS analysis of the spots shown reveals strong intensities of Ca, Si, O and C (Figure 39 \n\nb1-4), suggesting the presence of a hybrid of hydrates and carbonates. Comparison of relative \n\nintensities of carbon and oxygen in Fig. 4.12 with those in Fig. 39 suggests that O/C is evidently \n\ngreater in the P-AC-24 sample. Similar result was found by Rostami et al., (2012).   \n\nFigure 39b-2 carbonation of C\u2013S\u2013H, whatever seems to be even more dependent on the \n\npermeability of the matrix. Fast decalcification of C\u2013S\u2013H is expected in highly permeable \n\ncomposite, accompanied by carbonation shrinkage, which is accelerated when the CaO:SiO2 \n\nmolar ratio (C/S) is reduced below 1.2 (CHEN et al., 2006). Also, suggesting carbonation \n\nmodified C\u2013S\u2013H is Si-rich but its binding capacity by Ca\u2013O structure is maintained (ROSTAMI \n\net al., 2012).

Specific surface area \n\nThe specific surface area of hardened cementitious composite indicates the amount of \n\naccessible fine pores (THOMAS et al., 1999). The surface area of well-hydrated cement \n\ncomposite as measured using water vapor, is remarkably consistent values between 100 and \n\n200 m2/g of dry cementitious composite (RARICK et al., 1996; THOMAS et al., 1999).  BET \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\nmethod includes internal surfaces present in microcracks or in open pores at only one end \n\n(TAYLOR, 1990).  \n\nEvaluated according to the BET method detailed in Section 3.3.3.7, experimental specific \n\nsurface areas for the eight paste mixtures in this study are reported in Table 22. The BET specific \n\nsurface area values for specimens stored in air curing, range from 39 to 57 m2/g in the initial \n\nages and range from 37 to 50 after aging cycles. Unaged samples present bigger specific surface \n\narea than the aged samples. The carbonated samples present bigger specific surface area than \n\nthe uncarbonated samples, due the carbonation of portlandite is manifested by the crystallisation \n\nof numerous calcite crystals on the portlandite platelets (CHRISTOPHE et al., 2006; PHAM \n\nAND PRINCE, 2014). The greatest specific surface area was for the condition P-AC-24 follow \n\nby the P-AC-10, but these two composites had a pore structure less accessible to water vapor \n\nin comparison to the other regimes as it shows at table 19 the physical properties. \n\n \n\nTable 22 - Specific surface areas from Dynamic vapor sorption DWVS. \n\nCuring Regime ABET (m\n2/g) \n\nP-UC-10 39.32 \n\nP-UC-24 45.98 \n\nP-AC-10 54.82 \n\nP-AC-24 56.87 \n\nP-UC-10 - AAC 37.82 \n\nP-UC-24 - AAC 40.78 \n\nP-AC-10 - AAC 49.83 \n\nP-AC-24 - AAC 42.83 \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40069-014-0079-y#CR5\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n119 \n\n \n\n4.4.  Stage 5: Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-\n\ncement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age \n\n4.4.1. Thermogravimetry (TG) analyse and X-ray diffraction analyse  \n\nAlong 10 h with the eleven sets of samples it is possible to evaluate the kinetics of carbonation \n\nthrough the differential thermogravimentric analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry analysis \n\n(TG), corresponding to Figure 40, 41 and Figure 42.  According to the literature, the mass loss \n\nat 100\u00b0C is associated to the escape of the pore water. The peak temperatures depend on the \n\ntechnique and amount present, and probably on the degree of crystallinity,  being typically \n\nshifted to 180-190\u00b0C for the material present in cement composites. DTA curves have been \n\nreported for other AFm phases (TAYLOR, 1990). But the absence of ettringite (AFt) peaks from \n\nan XRD pattern at Figure 43, could be a proof that this phase may not be formed in the fiber-\n\ncement carbonated composite that use silica as a mineral addition. This could be beneficial \n\nconsidering that ettringite (AFt) formation has been previously suggested as one of the \n\ndegradation mechanisms of cellulose pulp fiber into cement matrix (MOHR et al., 2005; MOHR \n\net al., 2006). The remaining cement anhydrous phase, such as alite (C3S), belite (C2S) and \n\ntricalcium aluminate (C3A) are also detected peaks from an XRD pattern at Figure 43. \n\nDTA curves of C-S-H preparations show endotherms at 100\u00b0-200\u00b0C and exotherms at 835\u00b0-\n\n900\u00b0C. CH begins to decompose at an easily detectable rate at about 370\u00b0C; under typical \n\nconditions for TG, decomposition is 98% complete at the end of the step at 580\u00b0C (TAYLOR, \n\n1990). Figure 42 shows the TG curve range of CH decomposition, it could be observed the \n\nslopes of mass loss in times of 0 h, until 7 h. DTA curves (Figure 40) and TG curves (Figure \n\n41) show what is evidence in the literature, that CO2 simultaneously reacts with C\u2013S\u2013H and \n\nCH and that the decalcification of C\u2013S\u2013H takes place prior to the formation of silica gel, the \n\nlatter starting at later stages of carbonation (GROVES et al., 1991). Based on the evolution of \n\n10 h carbonation process in a fiber-cement composite that uses silica as a mineral addition, it is \n\npossible to split in two groups from P-AC-24-0h to P-AC-24-5h and P-AC-24-6h to P-AC-24-\n\n10h. The first group presents the rapid rate of calcium hydroxide carbonation process and the \n\nsecond group shows the slow rate of carbonation process due to the mass of loss percent \n\nobserved for this phase. CH carbonation may be initially more rapid than that of the C\u2013S\u2013H \n\ngel, but this situation soon reverses because of the formation of a layer of CaCO3 micro crystals \n\nat the surface of CH (GROVES et al., 1991; THIERY et al, 2007). \n\nOn both groups, the rate of calcium carbonate formation is constantly growing. The dissociation \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n120 \n\n \n\npressure of calcite reaches at 894\u00b0C and the decarbonation reaction is highly endothermic. The \n\nrate of decarbonation becomes significant at 500-600\u00b0C if a sufficiently low partial pressure of \n\nCO2 is maintained or if the calcite is intimately mixed with materials, such as quartz at 560\u00b0C \n\n(TAYLOR, 1990). The C\u2013S\u2013H is progressively decalcified, being converted to CaCO3 and \n\nsilicate hydrates. The porosity of fibre\u2013cement composites is typically high enough to permit \n\nconstant CO2 diffusion, which results in the Ca(OH)2 to be further reduced and the calcium ions \n\nreleased from C\u2013S\u2013H react with carbon dioxide (FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004).   \n\n \n\nFigure 40 \u2013 DTA curves of Carbonated Curing process along 10 h in fiber\u2013cement specimens  \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\nFigure 41 \u2013 TG curves of Carbonated Curing process along 10 h in fiber\u2013cement curing \n\nregimes  \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\nFigure 41 \u2013 TG curves of Carbonated Curing process along 10 h in fiber\u2013cement specimens, \n\nrange of CH decompose.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n122 \n\n \n\nFigure 43 - XRD patterns of the four sets of curing regimes. \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n \n\nAccording with Taylor (1990), TG has often been used to determine CO2, but is not suitable \n\nbecause the loss at 700-900\u00b0C is not only due to CO2. The presence of calcite peaks is a proof \n\nthat CO2 is existing. Also, the CaCO3 could occur in other forms (e.g. as vaterite and aragonite) \n\n(YLM\u00c9N et al., 2009), but in this 10 h analysis of accelerated carbonated process, the XRD \n\npattern (Figure 43) indicates that there is an absence of this last phases mentioned, and calcite \n\nis the only form of calcium carbonate identified.    \n\nThe estimated amount of mass loss of calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 and calcium carbonate \n\n(CaCO3) is calculated following the procedure proposed by Borges et al. (2010) using the \n\nequations (14) and (15). This procedure considers increased molecular mass resulting from the \n\ncarbonation process, as shown in Table 23 and would suggest an increase to the percentage of \n\nmass lost, confirmed in the thermogravimetric data (DTG) presented in Figure 40 \n\nDehydroxylation, L1, occurs between 450 and 500\u00b0C, the mass loss in this range decreases as \n\nthe carbonation exposure time increases, and decarbonation losses, L2, occurs between 600\u2013\n\n750\u00b0C. The initial amount of Ca(OH)2 may be directly calculated from Eq. (16). The \n\ncorresponding amount of CaCO3 resulting from the total Ca(OH)2 that carbonated was \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n123 \n\n \n\nestimated using Eq. (17). \n\n%CH = L1 ?\n74\n\n18\n= 4.11 ?

The second group (P-AC-24-6h \n\nto P-AC-24-10h) shows the slow rate of calcium hydroxide carbonation process and the \n\noccurrence of C-S-H carbonation process.

This could be attributed to the \n\ninterchange of Ca2+ ions in the carbonation process, that after 7 h it is considered that occurs \n\ncomplete in the CH carbonation process, so from this point the primary carbonation process \n\nenter in a cycle don\u2019t allowed to reduce more the portlandite, nor did influence the increase of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n124 \n\n \n\nthe calcium carbonate. At 10 h of carbonation process the increase of the amount of calcium \n\ncarbonate it is only attributed to the secondary carbonation process.  \n\n4.4.2. FTIR spectrometer analysis \n\nIn all of the samples, except for the P-AC-24-0 h, the carbonate is easily seen with DR-FTIR \n\nspectroscopy within 5 h, 7 h and 10 h of exposure to CO2 atmospheres. \n\nIn a moist atmosphere the CO2 reacts with calcium extracted from both the clinker and the \n\ncalcium silica gel. Figure 44 shows the peaks at 879, 1088, 1425, 1804 and 2511 cm-1 can be \n\nobserved in all of the spectra and were assigned to CaCO3 for the condition P-AC-24-5 h, P-\n\nAC-24-7 h and P-AC-24-10 h. The formation of calcium carbonate is evident since 5 h of \n\ncarbonation process with a maximum peak at 10 h carbonated condition.   It is interesting to \n\nnote that for the 10-h hydration sample there is also a dip at 3000 cm-1  and ~950-1,100 cm-1 \n\ncorresponding to the peaks for C-S-H (YLM\u00c9N et al.,2009). The band at ~1,650 cm-1, together \n\nwith the increased intensity in the OH-stretching region, indicates absorption of water for all \n\nhydration times.  \n\nThe formation of CaCO3 in cement is a complex process that can contain reactions at various \n\nparticle surfaces. In the early stages the carbonates formed could be considered amorphous, \n\nsince the crystallites have not yet developed a well-defined structure. The broadening of the \n\nband observed at 1,088 cm-1 indicates a less ordered structure because the peak is expected to \n\nbe narrow if the phases are crystalline (YLM\u00c9N et al., 2013). \n\nAt early edges the formation of CaCO3 is consistent with the infrared spectra of synthesized \n\namorphous calcium carbonate (LAM et al., 2007; ANDERSEN AND LJERKA BRE?EVI?, \n\n1991). At later stages a more crystalline product can be expected. Consequently, the \n\ncharacteristic vibration peaks in the region 1,300\u20131,700 cm-1 are characteristic of all carbonate \n\nspecies irrespective of the chemical and physical form (YLM\u00c9N et al., 2013).  \n\nIn a CO2 rich atmosphere there is a noticeable presence of Ca(OH)2, seen as a peak at              \n\n3,643 cm-1 in the condition P-AC-24-0 h. Also, asymmetric stretching of ??4\n2 at 910 cm-1 \n\n(MYNENI et al., 1998) was observed only in uncarbonated matrix, different of symmetric \n\nstretching at 1000 cm-1 occurring in P-AC-24-0 h. It indicates the decrease of ??4\n2 free ions \n\nwhen carbonation process occurs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n125 \n\n \n\nFigure 44 - FTIR patterns of Carbonated curing process along 10 h in fiber\u2013cement specimens \n\n \n\nSource: authorships. \n\n4.4.3. Microstructure of the composites SEM \n\nMicrographs presents were obtained by a SEM in Back-Scattered Electron Image (BSEI) mode \n\nfor the observation of the morphological features of cut and polished surfaces of composites \n\nsubjected to a very early age carbonated composites, the condition P-AC-24-0 h, P-AC-24-5 h, \n\nP-AC-24-7 h and P-AC-24-10 h. The images have a magnification of 300 x and accelerating \n\nvoltage of 15 kV. The SEM micrographs shown are typical images of the microstructure chosen \n\nfrom around six representative images for each composite treatment. \n\nFigure 45 a depicts arrow 1 the initial porosity is observed in the matrix, which is influenced \n\nby the application of the slurry-dewatering and manual pressing in the composite at the \n\nfabrication process and the significant volume of fibers; that eases the penetration of CO2 for \n\nenhanced the composite (TONOLI et al., 2010). The cement matrix (including around the \n\nfibers) become denser and compact along the 10 h of carbonation process (Fig. 45b, c, d).  \n\nThe uncarbonated composite presents swelling in the fibers, due the water absorption, \n\naccompanied by volume expansion, from 24 h of initial hydration process of the matrix (arrow \n\n2 in Figure 45a). After 5 h of carbonation process the cellulose fiber shrinkage, arrow 3 (Figure \n\n45b,c,d) shows the interface fiber-matrix, it is notable how the accelerated carbonation process \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n126 \n\n \n\nimproves the contact between cellulosic fibers and cement matrix, and possibly favoring the \n\nbetter adhesion between them (PIZZOL et al., 2014). However, arrow 4 (Figure 45 c,d) depicts \n\ncracks in the matrix that are observed in two of the carbonated conditions (P-AC-24-7h and P-\n\nAC-24-10h) and surrounding of some of the cellulose pulp. These cracks are indicative of a \n\nweak contact between cellulose fibers and matrix, the deficient fiber-matrix interface is linked \n\nto behavior of mechanical properties (SAVASTANO et al., 2003; SAVASTANO et al., 2005). \n\nThese cracks could appear due the fiber swelling and shrinkage along the matrix hydration \n\nprocess. Another problem that appears in the samples under carbonated conditions (P-AC-24-\n\n7h and P-AC-24-10h) is indicated with Arrow 5; the early carbonation did not prevent the re-\n\nprecipitation of hydration products inside the cellulose fibers as different alkaline solid phases \n\ninto the fiber. This re-precipitation of solids into the fiber voids (both fiber cell wall and fiber \n\nlumen) induces the embrittlement of the cellulose fibers by the attack of released alkaline\u2019s ions \n\n(SANTOS et al., 2015; TONOLI et al., 2016).  \n\nFigure 45- BSEI SEM for fabricated composites. a.)

Stage 2: Definition of optional parameters for supercritical carbonation process of \n\nvegetable Fiber-cement composites at a very early age \n\nThe main contributions for define parameters for supercritical carbonation process at very early \n\nage of vegetable Fiber-Cement Composites are: \n\n\u2022 The results indicate that the bleached pulp reinforcement carbonated composites show \n\naverage higher values of MOR, LOP, MOE, and SE that were 24%, 24%, 27% and 25%, \n\nrelating the unbleached pulp reinforcement carbonated composites. This difference was \n\nattributed to the degree of crystallinity, the lignin content and hydrophobic of the vegetal \n\nfiber that could influence the improvement of the mechanical behavior of a cementitious \n\ncomposite subjected to carbonation. The SEM images showed that bleached cellulose pulp \n\nhad better fibers-matrix adhesion than the unbleached cellulose pulp. \n\n\u2022 The carbonation time of 2 h or 1 h resulted in no statistically significant effect on the \n\nspecimen\u2019s bulk density, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity or specific energy. It \n\nwould appear that for guaranteed improvements to the mechanical properties of \n\ncomposites, the accelerated supercritical carbonation process only requires 1 h.  \n\n\u2022 Thermal hydration duration of 24 h or 48 h resulted in no statistically significant effect on \n\nthe physical and mechanical properties (bulk density, water adsorption, modulus of rupture, \n\nmodulus of elasticity and specific energy) of the vegetable fiber-cement composites. \n\nDuring the thermal curing of samples, hydration occurs at a rapid rate; for both cases \n\nhydration results were similar, highlighted by the TG/DTA results which revealed similar \n\npercentages of calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate for specimens with 24 h or 48 h \n\nof thermal curing.  \n\n\u2022 The results confirm what previous studies have concluded regarding the effectiveness of \n\nthe carbonation curing process in decreasing the alkalinity and mitigating the degradation \n\nof cellulose fibers of natural fiber reinforced cement composites.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n128 \n\n \n\n5.2. Stage 3: Comparative study between two kinds of mineral addition in cellulose pulp \n\nfiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age. \n\nThe main contributions for a comparative study between two kinds of mineral addition in \n\ncellulose pulp fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age \n\nare: \n\n\u2022 The effect of the mineral addition resulted in statistical significant effect on the mechanical \n\nproperties (modulus of rupture, limit of proportionality and modulus of elasticity) of the \n\nunbleached Pinus vegetable fibre -cement composites with 24 h of initial curing and subject \n\nto carbonation process. The composite with addition of ground silica resulted in flexural \n\ntest average statistically significant higher values of Limit of proportionality around 46% \n\ncomparing with the limestone composite. This could be attribute to the interface interaction \n\nbetween the matrix and the mineral addition. On the other hand, the effect of the mineral \n\naddition resulted in no statistical significant effect on the physical properties (water \n\nabsorption and bulk density). Which means both carbonated cementitious matrices, have \n\nthe same densification and compaction  \n\n\u2022 The initial hydration duration of 10 h or 24 h resulted in no statistically significant effect on \n\nthe physical and mechanical properties (bulk density, water adsorption, modulus of rupture, \n\nmodulus of elasticity and specific energy under flexure) of the vegetable fiber-cement \n\ncomposites. \n\n\u2022 The composite with silica addition consumes higher amount of calcium hydroxide (CH) in \n\ncomparison with the composite with limestone addition, based on the CH residue detected \n\nin the XRD analysis: 3.5% and 11.5% respectively. This could be due the XRD patterns of \n\nquantification  of the phases of each mineral addition and owing silica chemically stable at \n\nlow temperatures.  \n\n \n\n5.3. Stage 4: Durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-cement \n\ncomposites using silica as a mineral addition. \n\nThe main contributions of the of durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-\n\ncement composites using silica as a mineral addition are: \n\n\u2022    The use of silica as a mineral addition in cementitious composites subject to uncarbonated \n\nand very early age carbonated curing process both after 200 accelerated aging cycles presents \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n129 \n\n \n\nno reduction of mechanical performance in MOR, LOP and MOE, except the SE. This \n\nsuggested that the use of silica in conjunction with unbleached pine fiber is an appropriate \n\nstrategy to mitigate degradation of the composite, even if it is not present in an autoclaved \n\ncondition. The SEM images show on both composites a good interfacial fiber-matrix bonding \n\nstrength. Also, the XRD results, on both uncarbonated and carbonated composites, does not \n\nshow the presence of ettringite formation which favorites decrease the degradation of pulp fiber \n\ninto cement matrix. However, further studies for do not have a reduction in SE on the \n\ncomposites after accelerated aging cycles, still needed.   \n\n\u2022    The initial hydration duration of 10 h or 24 h resulted in no statistically significant effect on \n\nthe physical and mechanical properties (bulk density, water adsorption, modulus of rupture, \n\nmodulus of elasticity and specific energy under flexure) of the vegetable fiber-cement \n\ncomposites. During the curing of samples, hydration occurs at a normal rate; for both cases \n\nhydration results were similar, highlighted by the TG/DTG results which revealed similar \n\npercentages of calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate for specimens with 10 h or 24 h of \n\ncuring.  \n\n\u2022    In the TGA, for the peak at 800\u00b0C related to decarbonation of CaCO3, uncarbonated \n\ncomposites before ageing and initial hydrated by 24 h presented loss of mass of about 4.15%, \n\nwhile the carbonated composites before ageing showed loss of mass around 23.6%. These \n\nresults suggest the effectiveness of the treatment with accelerated carbonation for 10 h and the \n\nefficacy to measurement the increase of CaCO3 after the curing process, due to the use of silica \n\nas neutral mineral addition on the composite.  \n\n\u2022    The XRD estimative amount of calcium carbonate in the carbonated composite presents an \n\nincrease before and after accelerated aging from 34% to 41.1%. This increase could be \n\nattributed to the natural carbonation at the aging chamber and the cement hydration process. \n\n \n\n5.4. Stage 5: Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-\n\ncement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age \n\nThe main contributions of the study of the evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached \n\ncellulose pulp fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age \n\nare: \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n130 \n\n \n\n\u2022    Following 10 h of carbonation process in a fiber-cement composite that uses silica as mineral \n\naddition, DTA results shows that after 7 h of carbonation process it is considered a complete \n\nreduction of the amount of calcium hydroxide. This study suggested that the carbonation time \n\nwith atmospheric CO2 concentration (20 vol%) could be reduce from 10 h to 7 h.   \n\n\u2022    The carbonation kinetic hydration at very early edge on unbleached pines cellulose pulp \n\nfiber-cement composites using silica as mineral addition, identified the main phases in the X-\n\nray diffraction patterns of the carbonated cementitious composites are: calcite (CaCO3); \n\nportlandite (P); tricalcium aluminate (C3A); belite (C2S) and alite (C3S). \n\n\u2022    SEM shows how the accelerated carbonation process improves the contact between \n\ncellulosic fibers and cement matrix, and possibly favoring the better adhesion between them. \n\nHowever, along of carbonation process, some issues could be affected the effectiveness of the \n\ntreatment on cellulose pulp fiber-cement composite, which is the apparition of cracks in the \n\nmatrix and surrounding the fibers. These problems could be related to the parameters chosen \n\nfor accelerated carbonation curing process that could be affecting the kinetic hydration of the \n\nmatrix or due to the selection of the fiber. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n131 \n\n \n\n6. CONCLUSIONS  \n\n\u2022 The use of unbleached or bleached cellulosic pulp for cementitious composites resulted \n\nin statistically significant effects on the mechanical properties of samples, including \n\nmodulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and specific energy. There is not statistically \n\nsignificant difference between 24 h and 48 h of initial thermal hydration, nor did between \n\n2 h and 1 h of exposure time of CO2 at the chamber for supercritical carbonation. The \n\nsupercritical treatment research suggests that the optimal parameters for production of \n\nvegetable fiber-cement composites include the use of bleached cellulosic pulp, 24 h of \n\nthermal initial hydration and 1 h of supercritical carbonation. However, the implications \n\nfor fiber-cement industry are a challenge upon, the CO2 autoclave process could be done \n\nat laboratory scale but for applicate at real scale still needs to create an adequate \n\ninfrastructure and establish the most proper process for being an applicate technology. \n\n\u2022 The use of limestone or silica as a mineral addition for carbonated cementitious \n\ncomposites resulted in statistically significant effects on the mechanical properties of \n\nsamples, including modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and limit of proportionality. \n\nThere is not statistically significant difference between 10 h and 24 h of initial hydration. \n\nThis stage suggests that the better parameters for production of carbonated vegetable \n\nfiber-cement composites include the use of ground silica as mineral addition, 24 h of \n\nsealed initial hydration and 10 h of accelerated carbonation in the environmental climate \n\nchamber at temperature of 45\u00b0C and relative humidity (RH) of 90%. The CO2 content in \n\nthe environmental climate chamber was monitored to 20 vol%. \n\n\u2022 The use of silica as a mineral addition for carbonated cementitious composites after \n\nAccelerated Aging Cycles resulted in no statistically significant effects on the mechanical \n\nproperties of samples, including modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and limit of \n\nproportionality. There is not statistically significant difference between 10 h and 24 h of \n\ninitial hydration. This stage suggests that the better parameters for production of \n\ncarbonated vegetable fiber-cement composites include the use of ground silica as mineral \n\naddition, 10 h of sealed initial hydration and 10 h of accelerated carbonation in the climate \n\nchamber at temperature of 45\u00b0C and relative humidity (RH) of 90%. The CO2 content in \n\nthe climate chamber was monitored to 20 vol%. \n\n\u2022 The use of silica as a mineral addition for carbonated cementitious composites, allow to \n\nstudy at early edge the evolution of the hydration kinetics. This stage suggests that the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n132 \n\n \n\nbetter parameters for production of vegetable fiber-cement composites include the use of \n\nground silica as mineral addition, 10 h of sealed initial hydration and 7 h of accelerated \n\ncarbonation in the climate chamber at a temperature of 45\u00b0C and relative humidity (RH) \n\nof 90%. The CO2 content in the climate chamber was monitored to 20 vol%.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n133 \n\n \n\n7. SUGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Study of the influence of low concentrations (e.g. 5%, 10%) of CO2, on fiber-cement \n\ncementitious composites subject to accelerated carbonation process that use silica as \n\nmineral addition. This research is suggested due the current  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Study of the amorphous amount of calcium carbonated and calcium hydroxide through \n\nSynchrotron Light Source (LNLS) Rietveld analysis, in fiber-cement cementitious \n\ncomposites subject to accelerated carbonation process.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n134 \n\n \n\n8.
