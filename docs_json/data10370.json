Given the state of preservation of clays \n\nminerals, it is possible to identify how they were formed, providing clues about \n\ncontinental weathering conditions (inherited minerals) and geochemical conditions in the \n\nwater column (neoformed or transformed). This study presents new mineralogical data \n\nfrom the Baskil section, a highly preserved middle Eocene succession in the Neo-Tethys \n\n(central Turkey). A gradual shift from a well-crystalline illite and chlorite interval \n\n(interval I) to a detrital smectite dominant interval (interval II) characterizes a change in \n\nsource area from metamorphic to igneous rocks and changes from physical to chemical \n\nweathering conditions on land. This period coincides with the Middle Eocene Climatic \n\nOptimum (MECO), indicating a mineralogical signature of the event. Higher content of \n\nterrigenous input being deposited from 40.5 to 40 Ma caused a dilution effect of the \n\ncarbonate materials as calcite and dolomite significantly decreases. Authigenic \n\npalygorskite showed an increasing trend from the middle to the uppermost portion of the \n\nsection, indicating favorable conditions in the water column for its formation. We assume \n\nthat conditions in the ocean circulation changed after 40 Ma, forming a stratified water \n\ncolumn with warmer and saline conditions at greater depths, favoring palygorskite and \n\npossibly authigenic dolomite precipitation. The mineralogical evolution of the Baskil \n\nsection reflects how sources and weathering regimes changed through time, and how \n\nthese changes can be related to global (i.e. MECO) and/or local to regional processes. \n\n \n\nKey-words: minerals, clay minerals, smectite, palygorskite, Neo-Tethys, MECO \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n vii \n\nList of Figures \n \nFigure 1: The clay cycle as proposed by Merriman (2005) showing different clay \n\nformation and alteration processes. .......................................................................... 3\t\nFigure 2: Distribution of kaolinite (a), illite (b), chlorite (c), and smectite (d) in \n\nsuperficial sediments from the world ocean (after STEIN, 2016). ........................... 6\t\nFigure 3: A compiled data set of stable oxygen isotopes from benthic foraminifera \n\nshowing a cooling trend from 65 Ma until present, highlighting warming periods \nthroughout the globe (Zachos et al., 2008). .............................................................. 8\t\n\nFigure 4: Geological map of the Elaz?? basin, showing in gray the middle Eocene \ndeposits from the K?rkge\u00e7it Formation and the location of the Baskil section \n(modified after \u00c7elik, 2013). .................................................................................. 11\t\n\nFigure 5: a) panoramic view of the studied section, highlighted with a red line; b) view \nof 1 meter thick calcarenites; c) intercalation of several thin calcarenites in the \nmarlstone, the thickest is at 106 msl; d) detail of a calcarenite about 20 cm thick in \nthe lower part of the section; e) detail of pristine gray marl under the detrital \ncovering. ................................................................................................................. 13\t\n\nFigure 6: Representative sketch of incident X-rays being emitted (tube) and received \n(detector) and an example of x-rays (red arrows) diffracting from parallel atomic \nplanes (blue line) at a specific angle (theta).

If we look at only the Phanerozoic, going back approximately 540 \n\nMa, a relatively small slice of time (when compared to ~ 4 Billion years ago; the planets\u2019 \n\norigin), we have seen five major extinction events, changed from a hot (greenhouse) to a \n\ncold planet (icehouse), the ocean chemistry has changed, and continents have collided to \n\nform incredibly high mountain ranges, and drifted apart opening oceans with abyssal \n\ndepths. It seems, in my humble opinion, that disequilibrium has always been present in \n\nEarth\u2019s system, but at the same time, it has found its way to evolve and main life as it is \n\ntoday. \n\n This ongoing evolutionary process perpetuates, and climatic and environmental \n\nchanges are now being modulated by us, humans (homo sapiens), who have been around \n\nfor approximately 200 kyr ago. The well-known and extensively used example is the rise \n\nin global surface temperatures. Could these past warmer geological periods have anything \n\nin common with our present, and most importantly with our near future? A recent study \n\nmade by (FOSTER et al., 2017) showed that by the 23rd century climate could reach a \n\nwarmth never seen in the past 420 million years. Understanding the underlying \n\nmechanism, such as causes, effects and duration of past climatic and environmental \n\nchanges could potentially give us clues regarding our close warmer future.  \n\n My motivation for this study was mainly to be working on a geological period of \n\napproximately 40 Ma, in which climate was at a transition phase from greenhouse to \n\nicehouse conditions. During this cooling trend in the Eocene Epoch, a global warming \n\nevent took place, which is still not well understood. My study was to look at clay minerals \n\nto try to understand environmental conditions over middle Eocene, how and what factors \n\ninfluenced their mineralogical changes. Were they related to climate, source rocks or \n\n\n\n 2 \n\nenvironmental conditions? Maybe a combination of all these? I hope by answering these \n\nquestions we can have a better understanding of what was happening in in the past, and \n\nmaybe, one day, we could know if this would happen in the future.   \n\n \n\n1.1 The origin of clay minerals: a brief overview \n\n Clay minerals form about one-third of all present sedimentary rocks and are the \n\nmost abundant minerals at the surface of the Earth (MOORE; REYNOLDS, 1997). This \n\ngroup of hydrous silicate minerals are composed of two-dimensional Si-bearing \n\ntetrahedral, and Al-bearing octahedral sheets stacked in a regular arrangement (FAGEL, \n\n2007). Despite their abundancy, clays1 are highly demanded for industrial purposes \n\n(MURRAY, 2007). Properties such as adsorption, catalysis and plasticity turned them \n\ninto useful tools from the development of traditional ceramics to modern nanotechnology \n\nresearch (ZHOU; KEELING, 2013). Additionally, understanding clay minerals formation \n\nprocesses, dispersal patterns and state of preservation and/or alteration can provide \n\nvaluable information regarding source areas and how past environmental conditions \n\nchanged through the geological time (CHAMLEY, 1989; VELDE, 1995; MERRIMAN, \n\n2005; MORTON, 2005; EHLMANN et al., 2011).  \n\n Clay minerals originates mostly from the alteration of pre-existing minerals, \n\nthrough weathering processes, which in turns initiates the \u201cclay cycle\u201d proposed by \n\nMERRIMAN (2005) (Figure 1). This near-surface alteration process leads to the \n\ndevelopment of soils and an array of different pedogenic profiles which will later be \n\npartially and/or entirely eroded, transported and deposited into sedimentary basins \n\n(GAL\u00c1N, 2006). Inherited clays, also known as detrital clays, are transported to the \n\n                                                \n1 The terms clays and clay minerals will be used to refer to phyllosilicates and not the clay size fraction \n(<2 \u00b5m), unless stated otherwise. \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nsedimentary basins with no or only little modification, consequently giving information \n\nabout the weathering conditions on the adjacent land-masses where they were formed \n\n(VELDE, 1995). This process usually occurs in two ways: (1) physical breakdown of \n\nparent rocks (physical weathering) and through (2) dissolution of pre-existing clays and \n\nnon-clay minerals, which under normal pH conditions hydrolysis is the main component \n\ninvolved (chemical weathering) (CHAMLEY, 1989).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1: The clay cycle as proposed by Merriman (2005) showing different clay formation and alteration \nprocesses (MERRIMAN, 2005).  \n\nAs time goes by, these deposits become thicker, and buried clays are likely to be \n\ntransformed in response to geothermal conditions and/or geotectonic evolution of the \n\nbasin (MERRIMAN, 2005).These clays are referred to as authigenic, which means they \n\nwere formed in situ. Even though they are considered as a minor component of clay \n\nminerals (VELDE, 1995), they can still characterize geochemical conditions where they \n\n\n\n 4 \n\noriginated. However, is important to mention that any sing of diagenesis2 can mask or \n\nerase completely the climatic signal imprinted by detrital clays (SINGER, 1984; THIRY, \n\n2000).  In addition, neoformation processes occurs either from minerals precipitating \n\nfrom solution, given a specific environmental condition, or from crystallization of \n\namorphous minerals (EBERL, 1984). Once the superficial or buried rocks and sediments \n\nare uplifted, the clay cycle reinitiates.   \n\n Despite climatic conditions, a combination of other factors such as parent material \n\n(rock-type), topography and time will determine which clays mineral assemblages are \n\nfound in a specific continental and/or marine sedimentary succession (GAL\u00c1N, 2006). \n\nDetrital smectite formed in soils is a product of chemical weathering and it is normally \n\nassociated with alteration of volcanic materials (CHAMLEY, 1989; LIU et al., 2003; \n\nLIMMER et al., 2012) under warm conditions in areas of low-lying poorly drained soils \n\nwith contrasting dry and wet seasons (ROBERT; CHAMLEY, 1991; WILSON, 1998; \n\nFRANKE; EHRMANN, 2010). On the other hand, kaolinite is usually formed under \n\nwarm and wet conditions with strong leaching associated to tropical regions (THIRY, \n\n2000). Illite and chlorite are usually inherited from crystalline rocks, through alteration \n\nof muscovite and biotite, and are typically found in higher latitudes where physical \n\nweathering prevails (EHRMANN; SETTI; MARINONI, 2005; BORCHERS et al., 2011). \n\nThe fibrous clay palygorskite, however, is more often neoformed or transformed in soils, \n\nshallow-marine environments, and in the deep-sea. These Mg-rich clays are characteristic \n\nof arid and semi-arid climates (e.g. Mediterranean region) when formed in soils and in \n\nshallow-marine environments (HILLIER, 1995). However, to precipitate in sediments \n\nfrom deep-sea locations, warmer, saline and alkaline conditions are required with \n\n                                                \n2 The term is used to refer to \u201call of the changes that a sediment undergoes after deposition and before the \ntransition to metamorphism\u201d (MIT). \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nfavorable Si and Mg activities (PLETSCH, 2001; GAL\u00c1N; POZO, 2011; THIRY; \n\nPLETSCH, 2011). \n\n \n\n1.2 Clay minerals as weathering proxies \n\n Previous studies have used the distribution and abundances of clay minerals \n\nassemblages in surface sediments from oceanic basins (BISCAYE, 1965; GRIFFIN; \n\nWINDOM; GOLDBERG, 1968; KOLLA; HENDERSON; VENKATARATHNAM; \n\nBISCAYE, 1973; BISCAYE, 1976) and the world oceans (RATEEV et al., 1969; \n\nWINDOM, 1976; RATEEV; SADCHIKOVA; SHABROVA, 2008) to establish \n\ndistribution patterns related to latitudinal climate regimes, weathering conditions, wind \n\nregimes, river discharge and ocean currents (Figure 2). Higher concentrations of kaolinite \n\nare in low latitudes where there is prevailing chemical weathering under warm and humid \n\nconditions (Figure 2a). Illite and chlorite reach their maximum values in middle to low \n\nlatitudes, particularly in the northern hemisphere indicating detrital origin due the large \n\nland-masses, where physical weathering dominates (Figure 2b, c). Smectite is abundant \n\nin the south Pacifc, indicating a volcanic origin (Figure 2d) (STEIN, 2016). \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Distribution of kaolinite (a), illite (b), chlorite (c), and smectite (d) in superficial sediments \nfrom the world ocean (after STEIN, 2016). \n\nThis relationship between clay mineral assemblages in surface sediments and \n\nmodern climate conditions gave scientists the possibility to go back in the geological time \n\nthrough sediment cores and continental succession and infer paleoceanographic and \n\npaleoclimatic conditions (e.g. FAGEL; ROBERT; HILLAIRE-MARCEL, 1996; \n\nPETSCHICK; KUHN; GINGELE, 1996; X. GINGELE et al., 2002; EHRMANN; \n\nSETTI; MARINONI, 2005; ALIZAI et al., 2012; CHEN et al., 2016). Epochs of \n\nsignificant climatic changes, such as the ones observed at the beginning of the Cenozoic \n\nEra (e.g. Eocene Epoch), are ideally to test whether clays respond to such changes from \n\na regional to a global context.  \n\n \n\n1.3 Climatic conditions during the Eocene  \n\nThe Eocene epoch (56 \u2013 38 Myr ago) was marked by a long-term cooling trend \n\ninterrupted by a series of warmer transient periods (ZACHOS et al., 2001; ZACHOS; \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nDICKENS; ZEEBE, 2008) (Figure 3). Such climatic perturbations were typically \n\nidentified by a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) and carbonate dissolution on the \n\nsea-floor, which included short-duration events such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal \n\nMaximum (PETM) ( ZACHOS et al., 2005; WESTERHOLD et al., 2007) and the Early \n\nEocene hyperthermals (LOURENS et al., 2005; GALEOTTI et al., 2010; SEXTON et al., \n\n2011; COCCIONI et al., 2012; WESTERHOLD; R\u00d6HL; LASKAR, 2012). Additionally, \n\nlonger-duration events like the early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) and the still \n\nenigmatic middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) ( BOHATY; ZACHOS, 2003; \n\nBOHATY et al., 2009; SLUIJS et al., 2013) left their imprints in continental and oceanic \n\nsedimentary successions. \n\nEarth\u2019s climate is changing towards warmer conditions that are similar to other \n\nwarmer periods in Earth history, such as during the Eocene, which have been identified \n\nusing various proxies, including specific mineral assemblages ( ROBERT; KENNET, \n\n1994; WANG et al., 2011; BORNEMANN et al., 2014; PUJALTE; BACETA; \n\nSCHMITZ, 2015; KEMP et al., 2016). Stratigraphic changes in clay mineral suites are a \n\nvaluable tool for the reconstruction of environmental history on global to regional scales \n\n( VELDE, 1995; CHEN; LIU; KISSEL, 2017). Provided that the diagenesis has not erased \n\nthe climate signal and only detrital clay minerals are present, these are reliable minerals \n\nfor paleoenvironmental reconstructions (THIRY, 2000), and additionally can indicate \n\npotential source areas and infer oceanic circulation patterns (e.g. FAGEL; ROBERT; \n\nHILLAIRE-MARCEL, 1996; PETSCHICK; KUHN; GINGELE, 1996; X. GINGELE et \n\nal., 2002). \n\n\n\n 8 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: A compiled data set of stable oxygen isotopes from benthic foraminifera showing a cooling \ntrend from 65 Ma until present, highlighting warming periods throughout the globe ( after ZACHOS et \nal., 2008). \n\n \n\nThis study characterizes the minerals and clay mineral assemblages from a well-\n\npreserved Neo-Tethys succession in central Turkey, which expands through the middle \n\nEocene. We test the hypothesis that variations in clay minerals reflect potential terrestrial \n\nsource areas and climatic conditions. In addition, we relate changes in the clay mineral \n\nassemblages to the terrestrial environmental conditions resulting from global warming \n\nduring the MECO warming period,  for which only a few studies exist (BOSBOOM; \n\nGUO, 2014; METHNER et al., 2016). \n\n \n\n1.4 Hypothesis \n\nPrevious studies, as mentioned above, have shown that depending on climate and \n\nenvironmental conditions a specific group of clay minerals can be formed. During warmer \n\nintervals, smectite and kaolinite are often observed as product of chemical weathering, \n\nwhile illite and chlorite are characteristic of colder intervals due to physical weathering. \n\nSince we are studying a period in which global temperatures rose, our hypothesis is based \n\non an increase of smectite and/or kaolinite during the warming phase (product of chemical \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nweathering) and increase in illite and chlorite during cold phase (product of physical). \n\nSource rocks also influence the mineralogy and consideration regarding the geology of \n\nthe Elazig basin is taken in combination with climatic and environmental conditions. \n\n \n\n2. Objectives \n\n Characterize the mineralogical assemblages from a terrestrial succession in \n\ncentral Turkey through X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\n(SEM) in order to obtain information on potential source areas and on prevailing \n\npaleoenvironmental conditions during the middle Eocene. \n\n2.1 Specific Objectives \n\na.) Determine the bulk and clay mineralogy for the studied succession through a \n\nsemi-quantitative method; \n\nb.) Correlate minerals and clay minerals with actual and potential source rocks to \n\ninfer their origin and changes in sources through the studied interval; \n\nc.) Analyze selected samples through SEM to determine if minerals are \n\ncharacteristic of a detrital or authigenic formation; \n\nd.) Correlate trends of minerals and clay minerals\u2019 relative abundancy with a \n\nglobal warming period and identify possible environmental conditions during \n\ntheir time of deposition \n\n \n\n3. Geological Context (Study Area) \n\n The studied stratigraphic succession, the Baskil section, occurs in central \n\nTurkey and is part of the K?rkge\u00e7it Formation, in the Elaz?? basin, 19.8 km NW of the \n\ntown of Baskil (located at 38\u00b036\u201930.34\u2019\u2019N, 38\u00b036\u201903.46\u2019\u2019E) (Figure 4). This section \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nmeasures 357 msl (stratigraphic meters from the base of the section) with a paleodepth of \n\n~300-600 m (RODELLI et al., in 2017), which is composed mainly of thick-bedded to \n\nmassive hemipelagic marlstone, formed by a mix of carbonate with fine-grained clastic \n\nrock (DONOVAN; PICKERILL, 2013), intercalated with calcarenite beds. Accumulation \n\nof large benthic foraminifera (LBF) within the calcarenite beds, which range from 15 cm \n\nto ~1 m thick, has been previously reported (\u00d6ZCAN et al., 2006). The age model for the \n\nBaskil section was presented by RODELLI et al. (2017), and extends from 41.7 to 37.2 \n\nMa. \n\nThe K?rkge\u00e7it Formation (dark grey portion of the map on Figure 4) has an E\u2013W \n\noriented area of approximately 40 km wide and 100 km long, which consists of clastic \n\ndeep-water and shelf deposits fed from a subaerially-exposed hinterland ( \u00d6ZKUL; \n\nKEREY, 1996; CRONIN et al., 2000). These hemipelagic sediments are interpreted to be \n\ndeposited in a back-arc basin on continental crust (CRONIN et al., 2007; \u00c7ELIK, 2013). \n\nFurthermore, within the K?rkge\u00e7it Formation, the Baskil section has not been deformed \n\nand does not show alteration despite the regional active tectonic regime. The good state \n\nof preservation of the section makes this location a primary target to develop proxies for \n\npaleoclimatic, paleoceanographic, and biotic events (RODELLI et al., 2017). \n\n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Geological map of the Elaz?? basin, showing in gray the middle Eocene deposits from the \nK?rkge\u00e7it Formation and the location of the Baskil section (modified after \u00c7ELIK, 2013). \n\nThe basement units for the Cenozoic sediments in the Elaz?? basin are the Permo-\n\nTriassic Keban metamorphic rocks and the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Elaz?? \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nMagmatic rocks (AKSOY; T\u00dcRKMEN; TURAN, 2005). The former consists of marble, \n\ncalc-phyllite, calc-schist, and metaconglomerate, which have undergone amphibolite- to \n\ngreenschist-facies metamorphism and was thrust over younger formations (TURAN; \n\nBING\u00d6L, 1991) the latter is made up of basalt, andesite, pillow lava, dacite, aplite, \n\ndolerite, and plutonic rocks (BING\u00d6L; BEYARSLAN, 1996). Both units could have been \n\npotential source areas for the mineralogical assemblage found in the studied section. \n\nOverlaying the magmatic rocks is the Harami Formation, composed of late Campanian\u2013\n\nMaastrichtian carbonate build-ups. Mass-flow conglomerates make up of Permo-Triassic \n\nKeban Metamorphic rocks and Late Cretaceous magmatic rock pebbles (AKSOY; \n\nT\u00dcRKMEN; TURAN, 2005) compose the early Paleocene deposits in the basin. The \n\nKu?\u00e7ular and Seske Formations (late Paleocene \u2013 early Eocene) are stratigraphically \n\nlocated at the base as a sandy limestone grading up into pure limestone composed mainly \n\nof algae and benthic foraminifera, with a high fraction of micritic matrix (AKSOY; \n\nT\u00dcRKMEN; TURAN, 2005). \n\n \n\n4. Material and Methods \n\n4.1 Field Sampling \n\n Two field trips were made to central Turkey, the last one being in June of 2015, \n\nwhere samples were collected. An initial lithostratigraphic log was defined and the \n\nsedimentary succession was measured (Figure 5). Afterwards, samples were taken to the \n\nIstanbul Technical University (ITU), where they were cut and latter brought to Brazil. \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n \n\nFigure 5: a) panoramic view of the studied section, highlighted with a red line; b) view of 1 meter thick \ncalcarenites; c) intercalation of several thin calcarenites in the marlstone, the thickest is at 106 msl; d) \ndetail of a calcarenite about 20 cm thick in the lower part of the section; e) detail of pristine gray marl \nunder the detrital covering. \n\n4.1.1 Lithostratigraphy \n\n A specific portion of the section, from 180 to 200 meters, was analyzed in closer \n\ndetail mainly due to six strata, here named Sisters (1-6), which called the attention due \n\nto their thickness and location along the section. Facies description were performed \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nalong with thickness measurements from each layer and sampling for specific thin-\n\nsection observation.   \n\n \n\n4.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) \n\n X-ray diffraction has been widely used to obtain information about structures of \n\ncrystalline materials. Normally, a powdered material is exposed to a monochromatic \n\nbeam of X-ray, which will in turn interfere or diffract when the beam hits the crystal \n\nlattice. The diffraction angles will vary with the distance (d-spacing) between adjacent \n\nplanes of atoms in the crystal. Subsequently, a distinctive diffraction pattern is generated \n\nfor every crystalline material (e.g. minerals). These diffraction angles can be used to \n\ncalculate the d-space (d) according to Bragg\u2019s Law: \n\n                                                          ? = 2?????           (4.1)  \n\nThe wavelength of the incident beam (?) is usually fixed for most diffractometers, and ? \n\nrepresents the angle between the diffracted beam and the crystallographic plane \n\n(MCREYNOLDS; SKAGGS; SCHROEDER, 2008). For example, each mineral having \n\nits own crystalline structure, will have a different set of diffraction peaks based on their \n\nplanes of atoms (Figure 6). Finally, by knowing the d-spacing and the diffracted patterns, \n\nit is possible to perform mineral identification based on comparison with standard \n\nmaterials. This technique was applied in this study to identify minerals and clay minerals \n\nfrom marlstone samples.  \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Representative sketch of incident X-rays being emitted (tube) and received (detector) and an \nexample of x-rays (red arrows) diffracting from parallel atomic planes (blue line) at a specific angle \n(theta).

(modified sketch taken from Panalytical).   \n\n4.3 Mineralogical Analyses \n\nA total of one hundred and twenty samples of marlstones from the Baskil Section \n\nwere analyzed using XRD for the bulk fraction and sixty-nine samples for the clay size \n\n(<2 \u00b5m) fraction. Measurements were made using a Panalytical X\u2019Pert3 Pro \n\ndiffractometer with an X\u2019celerator detector (CuK? radiation; 45 kV; 40mA) at the United \n\nStates Geological Survey (USGS), Santa Cruz, CA. The bulk and clay size fraction \n\nscanning ranges were from 3 \u2013 70\u00b0 2q and 3 \u2013 30\u00b0 2q, respectively, both with a step size \n\nof 0.03\u00b0 2q and a measuring time of 80 seconds per step. Data processing was made with \n\nthe MacDiff 4.2.5 software (PETSCHICK, 2001). \n\n \n\n4.3.1 Bulk fraction \n\nBulk rock samples were powdered with a microdrill and placed in an aluminum \n\nsample holder, applying gentle pressure to allow randomly oriented aggregates. All \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nsamples are required to have the same particle size to avoid discrepancies between \n\nminerals intensities, which could influence the semi-quantitative results. XRD patterns \n\nfrom randomly oriented mounts were semi-quantified according to HILLIER (2003) and \n\nMOORE; REYNOLDS (1997) using the integrated peak areas (IPA) of individual peaks \n\nby applying the following reference intensity ratios (RIR): quartz (4.26 \u00c5) \u2013 RIR 0.91; \n\nalbite (3.18 \u00c5) \u2013 RIR 2.2; K-feldspar (3.24 \u00c5) \u2013 RIR 1; phyllosilicates (4.5 \u00c5) \u2013 RIR \n\n0.71; calcite (3.03 \u00c5) \u2013 RIR 3.1; dolomite (2.88 \u00c5) \u2013 RIR 2.7. The IPA for each mineral \n\nidentified in every diffractogram was divided by their respective RIR to be semi-\n\nquantified in such manner: \n\nMineral weight (%) = 100* (IPA/RIR)/sum              (2) \n\nMineral standards were used to test the XRD accuracy in relation to the RIR \n\nvalues and errors were calculated to be in the range of + 5% from the known amounts as \n\nshown in Table 1.   \n\nTable 1: Mixtures of standard minerals with specific known values were made and calculated. An error of \napproximately + 5% was observed between known and calculated values.  \n\n  \nMineral Integrated Peak Area (cps) d-spacing (\u00c5) RIR \n\nKnown \nValues \n(%) \n\nCalculated \nValues (%) \n\n       \n\nSample 1 \nCalcite 109210 3.03 3.1 20 20.124 \nQuartz 20773 4.26 0.91 10 13.049 \nAlbite 257415 3.18 2.2 70 66.837 \n\n       \n\nSample 2 \nCalcite 168208 3.03 3.1 50 46.234 \nQuartz 49773 4.26 0.91 40 46.605 \nAlbite 18490 3.18 2.2 10 7.161 \n\n       \n\nSample 3 \nCalcite 430497 3.03 3.1 90 92.219 \nQuartz 5545 4.26 0.91 3 4.046 \nAlbite 12372 3.18 2.2 7 3.734 \n\n       \nSample 4 Calcite 79180 3.03 3.1 20 19.42 \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nQuartz 79575 4.26 0.91 70 66.49 \nCorundum 18532 2.08 1 10 14.09 \n\n       \n\nSample 5 \nCalcite 30078 3.03 3.1 10 5.464 \nQuartz 152757 4.26 0.91 90 94.536 \n\n              \n \n\n4.3.2 Clay size fraction \n\nThe first step required to analyze clay minerals is to remove all organic matter and \n\ncalcium carbonate from the samples and afterwards separate the clay fraction (<2 \u00b5m) \n\nfrom the bulk material (Table 4, Sup. Material). Not only clay minerals are found in the \n\nclay fraction, however, they are more easily identified and quantified when separated \n\nfrom the whole-rock. All clay mineral samples followed specific treatments described by \n\n(HEIN; SCHOLL; GUTMACHER, 1976; HEIN et al., 2003). Approximately 10 g of \n\nmaterial were soaked in a combination of 30% ?,?, and Morgan\u2019s solution (sodium \n\nacetate and glacial acidic acid) to remove organic matter and carbonates, respectively \n\n(Figure 7A). After the removal of organic matter and calcium carbonate, a first run in the \n\ncentrifuged (2500 rpm for 5 minutes) was performed to separate the ?,?, and Morgan\u2019s \n\nsolution from the rest of the material (Figure 7B). The following step was to wash the \n\nsamples with 2% sodium carbonate (??,??1). A magnetic stirred was used to suspend \n\nagain the material, which was later re-concentrated into a test tube using a 0.01% Na2CO3 \n\nto rinse any residues (Figure 7C). This material, which was suspended in the test tube \n\nwent for a second run on the centrifuge (850 rpm for 3 minutes) (Figure 7D). After \n\ncentrifugation, all material still in suspension had a settling diameter of 2 \u00b5m or less \n\n(Figure 7E).  \n\nThe &lt;2 \u00b5m fraction was saved, and this process was repeated 10 times for every \n\nsample: re-suspending the material with 0.01% Na2CO3 and centrifuging the material \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nuntil all the clay size fraction was extracted from every sample (Figure 7F and G). The \n\nclay fraction was concentrated at the bottom of the best tube through another run of the \n\ncentrifuge (2500 rpm for 5 minutes) and washed two times with distilled water to remove \n\nexcess salts. Finally, the clay-sized fraction was oriented on zero background holders \n\nprior to analyses (Figure 7H). A complete list (a step-by-step) with specific details \n\nregarding sample preparation follows attached at the supplementary material. \n\n A set of three diffraction patterns were made for each sample, followed by air \n\ndrying (AD), ethylene glycol solvation for 24h (EG) and heating to 375\u00b0C for 1h (H), and \n\nused for mineral identification and quantification purposes. Semi-quantitative estimations \n\nfor the clay mineral abundances were based on the EG curve on specific integrated peak \n\nareas of individual peaks and weighting factors, following (BISCAYE, 1965). Peak \n\ndeconvolution of peak doublets was performed for the following minerals: \n\nsmectite/chlorite (17/14 \u00c5), palygorskite/illite (10.5/10 \u00c5) and kaolinite/chlorite \n\n(3.58/3.54 \u00c5) (GUO; UNDERWOOD, 2011; EHRMANN et al., 2015). The same \n\nweighting factors used for kaolinite and chlorite was used for palygorskite (EHRMANN \n\net al., 2015). Clay mineral ratios were calculated from mineral relative abundances. \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n \nFigure 7: Pictures of sample preparation process for clay mineral analysis, showing (A) removal of organic \nmatter and calcium carbonate, (B) separation of material through a first run in the centrifuge, (C) magnetic \nstirrer used with sodium carbonates, (D) centrifuge with samples prior to the analyses, (E) less than 2 \u00b5m \nfractionin the test tube, (F) clays (<2\u00b5m) still in suspension, (G) clays(<2\u00b5m) settled in the bottom of \nbeakers, and samples already oriented on zero background holders prior to analisis.  \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nIllite crystallinity was measured using the full width at half maximum height \n\n(FWHM) and the integral breadth (I Breadth) of the 001 basal illite peak on EG samples \n\nas values of ?2\u00b0? (Figure 8). Both measurements presented the same trends and only the \n\nFWHM will be further discussed (ALIZAI et al., 2012; LIMMER et al., 2012). Low \n\nvalues indicate good crystallinity (lower weathering intensity), whereas high values \n\nindicate poor crystallinity (higher weathering intensity) (LAMY; HEBBELN; WEFER, \n\n1998; PANDARINATH, 2009). The illite chemistry was obtained from peak area ratios \n\nof the basal 002/001 (5 \u00c5/ 10 \u00c5) peaks. Ratios > 0.4 correspond to Al-rich illites \n\n(muscovite), while ratios &lt;0.15 are related to Mg and Fe-rich illites (biotite) \n\n(ESQUEVIN, 1969). \n\n \n\nFigure 8:Measuremts used for crystallinity: integral breadth and FWHM.

(modified after EHRMANN et al, \n2005)  \n\n \n4.4 Benchtop X-ray (BTX) diffraction system \n\nThe Olympus BTX II Benchtop XRD was derived by the Mars Science \n\nLaboratory and is an ideal equipment to perform general characterization of specific \n\ncrystalline materials in the field and in the laboratory. This equipment has been used in \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nextraterrestrial missions (e.g. Gale Crater in Mars within the Curiosity Rover) and it is \n\nnow available for students at the Oceanographic Institute (IO-USP) ( SARRAZIN et al., \n\n2005; BLAKE et al., 2012). \n\nKey features for the BTX include a vibrating sample holder, which allow samples \n\nto be analyzed in a non-oriented manner, particularly well-suited for bulk mineralogy. \n\nThis equipment was previously used in paleoclimatic studies (e.g. SAVIAN et al., 2014, \n\n2016), however a method is still under development to accomplish solely clay minerals \n\nanalysis in an oriented manner. For this reason, we chose to perform our analysis using \n\nthe Panalytical X\u2019pert 3, even though more than 300 samples were analyzed with the \n\nBTX. A couple of additional results concerning the BTX will be attached in the \n\nsupplementary material (Fig. 24, 25).  \n\n \n\n4.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nSmall blocks of selected marlstones samples were broken to expose a fresh \n\nfracture surface representative of the texture and structure of the rock (KELLER; \n\nREYNOLDS; INOUE, 1986). Samples were coated with Au-Pd and analyzed in a \n\nTESCAN VEGA3 microscope (15kV and 10nA for imaging), which included X-ray \n\nenergy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) using an Oxford Xmax 50 detector (20 s of live \n\ncounting time). All the data were refined with the AZtech software and processed at the \n\nUSGS, Menlo Park, CA. Additional samples were analyzed at the Institute of \n\nGeosciences (IGc), at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where a LEO-440i scanning \n\nelectron microscope coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was used, \n\nand samples coated with carbon. \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n5. Results \n\n5.1 Lithostratigraphy \n\n The most significant lithological changes in the Baskil section are generally \n\nmarlstones intercalated with calcarenite beds throughout the entire interval. Calcarenite \n\nbeds had a range of ~20 cm to 1 m thick and were less frequently observed from 0 to 180 \n\nm. After this interval, from 180 to 200 m, six strata (Sisters 1-6) in close proximity to \n\neach other show distinct lithological changes (Figure 9). Through the upper portion of the \n\nsection, after the Sisters\u2019 interval, calcarenite beds were observed more frequently.  \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Detail portion of the Baskil section, from 180 to approximately 200 meters, showing changes in \nmarlstones intercalated with calcarenite beds made from field observations. The age model was based on \nRODELLI et al., 2017. \n\nLight gray to dark gray marlstone were observed in between the Sisters, including \n\na thin layer of fine sandy calcareous marl at approximately 191 m. Sisters 1 through 4 \n\nhad a similar overall texture, color and grain size. They were a mixture of carbonate and \n\nsiliciclastic material with crossbedded lamination in the upper part of each bed (Figures \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n10A,B). Grain size were slightly coarser on the bottom and became finer towards to upper \n\nportion of each bed (Figure 10B). Bioturbation was observed in Sister 3 (Figure 10C). A \n\nnummulitic marl layer with irregular thickness ranging from 1 to approximately 2 meters \n\nwas observed bellow Sister 4 (Figures 10D, E). Small layers of nummulitic packstone \n\nwere also observed bellow Sisters 3, 4 and 5 (Figures 10F, G). Sisters 5 had a crossbedded \n\nlamination in the middle portion of the bed, while Sister 6 had a more homogeneous grain \n\nsize throughout the entire bed with a well-defined base (Figure 10H).  \n\n \nFigure 10: Detail of the Baskil section spanning the interval from 180 to 200 meters, showing (A) Sister \n1with crossbedded lamination, (B) Sister 2 with slightly coarser grain size in the on the bottom and finer \ngrains at the top, (C) bioturbation sings (vertica lines) at the top of Sister 3, (D) thick nummulitic \nmarlstone between Sisters 3 and 4, (E) detail of nummulitic marlstone, (F) nummulitic packstone bellow \nSister 5, (G) detail of nummulitic packstone, (H) well-defined base of Sister 6 with rusty layer bellow in \nthe marlstone.  \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n5.2 Mineralogy of marlstones \n\nBased on mineral relative abundances and temporal trends, it was possible to \n\nsubdivide the section in three intervals (I, II, and III; Figure 11 and 12). In general, the \n\nsilicate group minerals have a strong negative correlation with calcite, while dolomite \n\noccurs only as a minor component and has a different trend than calcite. Clay mineral \n\nsuites show significant variations in the abundances of smectite and illite, while \n\npalygorskite appears from the middle to the uppermost interval of the section. \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Bulk mineralogy \n\nThe bulk mineral assemblages are composed mainly of quartz, albite, K-feldspar, \n\nphyllosilicates, calcite and dolomite, with variable abundances throughout the section. \n\nThe lower interval (interval I; 0 msl \u2013 125 msl) shows generally decreasing trends for \n\nquartz (14% to 7%), albite (8% to 2%), and phyllosilicates (17% to 6%), as well as an \n\nincreasing trend for calcite (60% to 78%) and decreasing trend for dolomite (10% to 4%). \n\nThe middle interval (interval II; 125 msl \u2013 275 msl) displays a significant shift in \n\nthe minerals abundances. From 145 msl to 163 msl, quartz, albite, and phyllosilicates \n\nreach their highest contents (15%, 7%, and 31%, respectively), while calcite gets its \n\nminimum (44%). K-feldspar and dolomite are present only in small amounts, from ?4% \n\nand 1% to 4%, respectively, and show no significant changes throughout the interval. At \n\n233 msl all silicates decrease to their minimum (quartz is approximately 6%; albite 1%, \n\nK-feldspar 0%, and phyllosilicates 8%), while calcite increases up to 85%. \n\nFor the upper section (interval III; 275 msl \u2013 357 msl), quartz, albite, K-feldspar, \n\nand phyllosilicates exhibit values similar to those in the lowermost part of the section. \n\nHowever, unlike interval I, the pattern shows a tendency to increase the abundances of \n\nphyllosilicates, quartz, albite and notably dolomite, while calcite decreases. Quartz \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nreaches up to 12%, albite up to 6% with a fairly constant trend, K-Feldspar peaks at 325 \n\nmsl with 6%, while calcite presents a decreasing trend (from 82% to 68%). Dolomite, \n\nwhich displays low values throughout most of the section, here increases from 323 msl \n\nto 357 msl with values up to 10%. \n\n\n\n 26 \n\n \nFigure 11: Bulk mineralogy of the Baskil section divided in three intervals based on temporal trends and \nin mineral abundances: Interval I, from 0-125 msl, interval II, from 125-275 msl, and interval III, from \n275-357 msl. \n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n5.2.2 Clay mineralogy \n\nClay mineral assemblages are dominated by smectite and illite (>75%), which \n\nhave an inverse relationship throughout the section. In addition, palygorskite (0% to \n\n14%), chlorite (2% to 9%), and kaolinite (1% to 3%) are less abundant. Kaolinite has a \n\nmean content of approximately 2%, which shows no significant variation within the error \n\nof the technique (FRANKE; EHRMANN, 2010).  \n\nA set of XRD patterns (Figure 13) characterizes the clay minerals variations \n\nthroughout the entire section, pointing out mineralogical changes (e.g., appearance of \n\npalygorskite at 10.5 \u00c5) in relation with the stratigraphic position. The lower interval \n\nshows smectite and illite fluctuating between 36% and 81%, and 14% and 43%, \n\nrespectively. Palygorskite is mostly absent from this interval, with an exception at 47 msl \n\n(4%), while chlorite decreases slightly from about 7% to 4%. In interval II, smectite \n\nreaches a maximum content of 85%, while illite reaches a minimum of 6%. In this \n\ninterval, palygorskite is found up to ~5%, while chlorite continues a decreasing trend until \n\n159 msl (2%) and then goes back to approximately 5%. Interval III is characterized by a \n\nsmectite content of about 80% until 285 msl, followed by a decreasing trend to 46% at \n\n332 msl. In this interval, illite increases up to 34% and palygorskite reaches a maximum \n\nof about 15% at 319 msl, while chlorite shows no significant change. \n\nIllite crystallinity shows fluctuations from approximately 0.2 to 0.6 ?2\u00b0q  for the \n\nentire section. Good crystallinity (lower values, less altered) is observed in interval I with \n\nvalues close to 0.2 ?2\u00b0q (Figure 12). Values begin to increase at ~130 msl (interval II) \n\nwith values of 0.32 and 0.44 ?2\u00b0q. The uppermost interval (interval III) shows poor \n\ncrystallinity (higher values, more altered) with values higher than 0.5 ?2\u00b0q above 325 \n\nmsl. The illite chemistry, based on the 5/10 \u00c5 peak area ratio, has a mean value of 0.65 \n\ncps. \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n \n \nFigure 12:  Clay mineralogy from the Baskil section following the same subdivisions previously used: \ninterval I, from 0-125 msl, interval II, from 125-275 msl, and interval III, from 275-357 msl. \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n \n\nFigure 13: A set of representative XRD patterns of the studied section subdivided into the three main \nintervals. Changes in illite crystallinity and the appearance of palygorskite are evident when comparing \ninterval I to interval III. \n\nThus, the illites are more Al-rich and Mg- and Fe-poor, proximal to the composition of \n\nthe muscovite. Only in the last few meters of the section, from 332 msl to 353 msl, values \n\ndecrease to about 0.2, possibly showing a more biotite rich composition (Figure 23, Sup. \n\nMaterial). \n\nClay mineral ratios were applied to highlight potential environmental changes \n\n(LIMMER et al., 2012; PAYROS et al., 2015). These ratios include smectite/chlorite and \n\n(smectite+kaolinite)/(illite+chlorite), as (ChW/PhW), in a logarithmic scale to show \n\nchanges from chemical to physical weathering (Figure 14). There is a significant change \n\nat approximately 125 msl, which is the beginning of interval II, where the \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nsmectite/chlorite ratio increases significantly (~40%) when compared to the lower \n\ninterval. The (ChW)/(PhW) decreases from 0% to -1%, at the same interval. However, \n\ntowards the top of the section smectite/chlorite ratio follows a decreasing trend, while the \n\nChW/ PhW remains steady until 275 msl, and then increases back to ~0%. Another typical \n\nclay parameter was the palygorskite/illite ratio (KOLLA et al., 1976; FAGEL et al., 1992) \n\nused to highlight palygorskite abundancy through the studied interval.  \n\n \n\nFigure 14:Clay mineral ratios used as proxies to identify chemical against physical weathering. Chemical \nweathering (ChW) is rpresented by (smectite+kaolinite) and physical weathering (PhW) as (illite+chlorite). \nChw/PhW was plotted in log scale (PAYROS et al., 2015) \n\n5.3 SEM \n\nUnder SEM, the marlstones showed to be generally well lithified. Clay minerals \n\noccur mainly as an abundant matrix in which detrital grains of quartz or feldspar are \n\nimmersed. (Figure 15A). A high abundance of smectite was observed showing an angular \n\noutline with a sometimes broken and deformed platy morphology, indicating detrital \n\norigin (Fig. 15B, C). No signs of authigenic platy clay minerals were found. Fibrous clays \n\nwere also observed in interval III (Figure 15E, F). EDS analyses showed the presence of \n\nSi, Al, Mg and Fe, and traces of Ca and K, in agreement with the chemical composition \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nof palygorskite (EDS). Dolomite appeared in the uppermost part of the section with a \n\nrhombohedral shape (Figure 15F) followed by EDS analysis (Figure 16). \n\n \n\nFigure 15: SEM images showing: (A) detrital grain of albite (A) surrounded by clay minerals at a depth \nof 8 msl; (B) and (C) detrital smectite (Sm) with platy morphology and \u201ccorn-flake\u201d structure at 154 msl; \n(D) and (E) interwoven short clay fibers (~1 \u00b5m) of palygorskite (P); (F) Dolomite with a rhombohedral \nshape from interval III; EDS showing the chemical composition of the fibrous clay minerals. \n\n\n\n 32 \n\n \nFigure 16: Spectrum 28 showing a rhombohedral dolomite \n\n6. Interpretation and discussion \n\n6.1 Lithostratigraphy \n\n Calcarenite beds in the Baskil section are most likely related to mass movement \n\nevents, in which an instability elsewhere at shallower depths allowed this material to be \n\ndeposited at a slope environment. By looking at the field observations and considering \n\nthe geology from the area, such instability was probably generated either through sea-\n\nlevel variations and/or due to an active tectonic regime.  \n\n Previous studies have related mass movement events, including turbidite \n\nsedimentation in  slope basin, with sea-level changes, climate and tectonics (e.g. ?PRINS; \n\nPOSTMA, 2000). Even though there is no sea-level curve for the Baskil section, \n\nsedimentation rates were decreasing (Figure 17) towards the uppermost part of the section \n\n(from 180 to 300 meters) as calcarenites were being deposited more frequently. This \n\ncould indicate that after 180 meters (~ 40 Ma) the tectonic regime became more active. \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n \n\nFigure 17: Sedimentation rates from the Baskil section (after RODELLI et al., 2017) \n\n Thin-sections of the Sister beds were analyzed and they contained significant \n\namounts of fossilized organisms (e.g. nummulites) among detrital grains (Figure 18). In \n\naddition, the presence of glauconite was observed throughout these strata (figure 18B, \n\nC, F). The formation of glauconite usually takes place in shallow-marine shelf locations \n\nwith low sedimentation rates (BALDERMANN et al., 2013). The presence of the green \n\nmineral shows that the carbonates and siliciclastic material composing the Sisters was \n\ncoming from a shallower platform, in which sedimentation rates were low.  Moreover, \n\nother studies have related the process of glauconitization during periods of sea-level \n\ntransgressions (LI et al., 2012). More work is still required in all calcarenite beds \n\nthroughout the studied section, including detailed work of facies description and thin-\n\nsections, in order to obtain a conclusive result regarding the origin and forcing \n\nmechanisms related to the calcarenite deposition. \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n \nFigure 18: Glauconite grains (A,B and C) among detrital grains and fossils in Sisters 2, 3 and 4, \nrespectively. (D) Benthic foraminifera (nummulite) in Sister 4, (E) plagioclase grain in Sister 5, and (F) \ncloser image of glauconite grain in Sister 6. \n\n6.2 Origin of clay- and non-clay minerals in the Baskil section  \n\nThe Baskil section is characterized by two main lithologies: monotonous \n\nhemipelagic marlstones and calcarenite beds. Mineralogical variations do not reflect \n\ndifferent rock types, since the lithological parameter is fixed and only marlstones were \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nanalyzed. Therefore, the main processes controlling the mineralogical input and clay \n\nmineral assemblages are the composition of the source area, types of weathering of the \n\nsource rocks (climate related), and offshore current patterns (FRANKE; EHRMANN, \n\n2010). \n\nDue to the fact that clay minerals in sedimentary rocks can be either detrital or \n\nauthigenic, it is thus crucial to determine their origin before using them as proxies for \n\nenvironmental and/or geochemical conditions in which they formed (THIRY, 2000). \n\nDetrital clay minerals refer to inherited minerals, either from rocks (parent material) or \n\nsoils developed on parent material by weathering (HILLIER, 1995). On the other hand, \n\nauthigenic minerals form (a) by in situ precipitation from solution, or (b) by diagenetic \n\nalteration, or (c) by replacement of pre-existing phases within the sediment column in the \n\ndepositional basin. \n\nIn the context of the Baskill section, palygorskite is considered to have an \n\nauthigenic origin, which will be further discussed. The occurrence of other authigenic \n\nminerals was discarded mainly due to observations through SEM, which indicated detrital \n\ncharacteristics and no signs of diagenesis. Additionally, sedimentary deposit thickness \n\ndid not exceed 2 km, which could also induce a diagenetic imprint ( CHAMLEY, 1989; \n\nBOLLE, M.; ADATTE, 2001; CHEN et al., 2016). Despite the active tectonics in the \n\nregion, the Baskil succession is tectonically undisturbed, with very little post-depositional \n\nalteration (RODELLI et al., 2017). Therefore, except for palygorskite, the clay mineral \n\nvariations in this section can be interpreted as from the weathering of continental rocks \n\nand soils that were later transported into the marine depositional basin. As the entire \n\nsection represents approximately 4 Myr of deposition (RODELLI et al., 2017), soils \n\nwould have been able to develop and reflect the weathering and climatic changing \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nconditions on the continent as they altered through that period of time (THIRY; DUPUIS, \n\n2000). \n\nSmectite and illite are the most abundant clay minerals in the studied section and \n\nshow a coeval and inverse relationship because of their different mechanisms of \n\nformation and environmental conditions under which they form. Smectite usually forms \n\nas weathering product in poorly drained soils with slow moving water, high pH, high \n\nsilica activity, and abundance of cations (GAL\u00c1N, 2006). These soils form under warm \n\nand humid conditions with highly seasonality with contrasting dry and wet phases \n\n(CHAMLEY, 1989; ROBERT; CHAMLEY, 1991). The Late Cretaceous magmatic \n\ncomplex could be a potential source for smectite as it is commonly derived from the \n\nalteration of volcanic rocks. On the other hand, illite and chlorite are commonly products \n\nof physical erosion of low-grade metamorphic rocks, such as the Permo-Triassic \n\nmetamorphic rocks, with little chemical weathering (ALIZAI et al., 2012). Kaolinite is \n\nnot abundant in the section, which is expected since conditions for its formation are quite \n\ndifferent than for the other clay minerals: very humid and warm, pervasively weathered \n\nand leached soil profiles. \n\nThe trend of the phyllosilicate\u2019s group parallels those of quartz throughout the \n\nstudied succession, suggesting a common detrital origin. Conversely, calcite derives \n\nmainly from biogenic micrite, and thus has an inverse relationship with the silicate \n\nminerals. This relationship can be explained by reciprocal dilution between the \n\nterrigenous and the carbonate fractions. K-feldspar is present only in small concentrations \n\nwith a mean value of 0.763 %, which is not significant for our discussion. The evolving \n\ntrends of clay- and non-clay minerals are discussed below, highlighting potential source \n\nareas and environmental factors influencing assemblage variations.  \n\nInterval I, 0 \u2013 125 msl, Lutetian \u2013 Bartonian \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n This interval is characterized by higher contents of illite and chlorite, and lower \n\nsedimentation rates (RODELLI et al., 2017). In the lowest part (0 \u2013 45 msl) well-\n\ncrystalized illite (mica) increases from 30% to 50% and chlorite from 7% to 9% (Figure \n\n12). This indicates the Permo-Triassic metamorphic complex as the potential source area \n\nwith a predominantly mechanical weathering regime. Quartz and albite show a decreasing \n\ntrend, while calcite slightly increases. Dolomite appears more significantly in the lowest \n\npart of the section without the presence of palygorskite, indicating a possible detrital \n\norigin for the Mg-carbonate. The concentration of both illite and chlorite decrease \n\ntowards the end of this interval, while smectite increases. This may reflect changes in the \n\nsource area from a metamorphic to a volcanic source, in combination with a transitional \n\nchange from physical to chemical weathering. \n\nInterval II, 125 \u2013 275 msl, Bartonian \n\n The middle portion of the section is characterized by clay mineral assemblages \n\ndominated by smectite (83%), over illite (10%) and chlorite (2%). This indicates a change \n\nfrom physical to persistent and pervasive chemical weathering conditions on the \n\ncontinent, where the magmatic complex was the primary source for the smectite. Warmer \n\ntemperatures and humid conditions contrasting with dryer periods are likely to have \n\noccurred, which is shown by the increase in poorly crystalline illite (0.45 2q). Higher \n\nsedimentation rates prevailed until ~170 m (RODELLI et al, 2017) and started to decrease \n\nafterwards, followed by the appearance of palygorskite (Figure 12). Other silicate \n\nminerals such as quartz (16%), albite (8%), and phyllosilicates combined (35%) increased \n\nsignificantly from ~145 msl to 170 msl, while calcite (43%) decreases. This indicates an \n\nintensification in terrigenous input being deposited into the sedimentary basin resulting \n\nin a dilution effect of the carbonate materials. This particular interval coincides with the \n\nlowest concentration of calcite and dolomite.  \n\n\n\n 38 \n\n The mineralogical assemblages above 170 msl begins to shift gradually to a calcite \n\ndominated period (85% at ~ 275 msl) while detrital minerals such as quartz (4%), albite \n\n(1%) and phyllosilicates (10%) decrease significantly. This biogenic carbonate \n\n\u201crecovery\u201d period can be interpreted as related to dryer environmental continental \n\nconditions, which caused a gradual decrease in the amount of material coming from the \n\nsurrounding land and lower sedimentation rates. This is also indicated by the relatively \n\nsmall variations in smectite (~70 \u2013 80%), illite (~8 \u2013 15%), and chlorite (~3 \u2013 5%), and \n\nby the concomitant presence of palygorskite (~1 \u2013 6%). Dolomite maintained a relatively \n\nlow concentration throughout the interval indicating not favorable conditions for its \n\nprecipitation (authigenic) or no important input from a shallower carbonate environment \n\n(detrital). \n\n To summarize, the mineral and clay mineral assemblages of interval II indicate \n\nenhanced chemical weathering, with relatively humid conditions and increasing \n\nterrigenous input into the sedimentary basin, which culminated in the beginning of \n\ninterval II (125 \u2013 170 msl). In the upper part of this interval (170 \u2013 275 msl), the \n\nconditions started to change gradually towards drier and with less chemical weathering. \n\nInterval III, 275 \u2013 357 msl, Bartonian \u2013 Priabonian \n\n The uppermost interval of the section is marked by a decrease in smectite (84 \u2013 \n\n49%), increase in illite (5 \u2013 34%), and increase in palygorskite (4 \u2013 15%), suggesting: (1) \n\nchange in the source area from igneous rocks back to the metamorphic complex, (2) less \n\nintense chemical weathering, and (3) changes in the water column chemistry. This clay \n\nmineral assemblage reflects source area conditions similar to those that characterize \n\ninterval I. However, the illite crystallinity index is much higher (0.6 2-theta) than in \n\ninterval I (0.2 2-theta), indicating that illite was altered in the terrestrial environment \n\nduring deposition of interval II, and was then transported and deposited in the depositional \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nbasin when sources changed back from igneous to metamorphic rocks. Additionally, the \n\ncombination of higher content of palygorskite (15%), the increase in dolomite (10%), and \n\nlow sedimentation rates points to a Mg-richer environment, probably with warmer and \n\nmore saline bottom water condition (THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011). \n\nAs mentioned above, the palygorskite found in the Baskil section is interpreted to \n\nhave formed in situ, which most likely precipitated in the pore spaces of near-surface \n\nsediments (Figure 15D,E). Indeed, it is highly unlikely that small delicate fibers (~1 \u00b5m) \n\nwere reworked from land or shallow-water environments and transported to the \n\ndepositional basin at water depths of ~300 to 600 m (RODELLI et al., 2017). Authigenic \n\npalygorskite has been observed in deep-sea sediments and it has been proposed to have \n\nrequired changes at the seabed and in the water column, such as reduced sedimentation \n\nrates, elevated ambient temperature, and high Mg and Si concentrations (PLETSCH, \n\n1998, 2001; THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011). These conditions are similar to the ones required \n\nfor the formation of authigenic/diagenetic dolomite, which also indicate a magnesium-\n\nrich environment (CHAHI; DUPLAY; LUCAS, 1993; THIRY; JACQUIN, 1993; \n\nTHIRY; PLETSCH, 2011); dolomite and palygorskite occur together in the uppermost \n\ninterval (interval III) of the Baskil section, and thus the environmental conditions \n\nproposed for their formation were likely extant in the Elazig basin.  \n\nPrevious work invoked the possibility of elevated deep-sea temperatures, salinity, \n\nand magnesium- and silica-rich waters to account for the formation of authigenic \n\npalygorskite during the lower Eocene (PLETSCH, 1998, 2001; SHOVAL, 2004). Since \n\nthe possibility of detrital palygorskite was unlikely, the conditions in the water column \n\nmust have changed. Magnesium could have been supplied by saline bottom water, \n\nperhaps fed from an evaporative platform, allowing the formation of palygorskite and \n\ndolomite (THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011). Evidence of such an evaporative environment in \n\n\n\n 40 \n\ncentral Turkey is marked by the occurrence of marine palygorskite, which appears in \n\nevaporative deposits spanning the Paleocene and Eocene within three other sedimentary \n\nbasins (e.g. Sivas, Hekimhan and Darende basin) in relatively close proximity to the \n\nElazig basin, where the Baskil section lies (PALMER; HELVAC\u00cd; FALLICK, 2004; \n\nYAL\u00c7IN; BOZKAYA, 1995, 2011; BOOTH et al., 2014). \n\nThe combination of leaching of lightly increased amounts of silicate minerals with \n\nthe increase in magnesium being fed from shallower environments, and an additional \n\nincrease in temperature and salinity could have provided the necessary conditions for the \n\nformation of the fibrous clay minerals. Changes in ocean circulation, including \n\nstratification of the water column, have been noted for warmer periods on Earth from the \n\nLate Cretaceous to the Eocene (BRASS; SOUTHAM; PETERSON, 1982; MILLER, \n\n1992; KROON et al., 2000; PAK; SHOVAL, 2004; THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011). Here we \n\nsuggest that a stratified water column occurred in the Baskil section due to changes in \n\ncirculation, which allowed conditions for the formation of authigenic palygorskite \n\naccompanied by dolomite in a Mg- and Si-rich environment under low sedimentation \n\nrates. \n\n The clay mineral assemblages in interval III can be attributed to various processes. \n\n(1) There was a change in source area that provided more weathered illite, previously \n\ndeveloped, and then (2) less intense chemical weathering on the continent. (3) Enhanced \n\nstratification of the water column may have been caused by changes in ocean circulation, \n\nin combination with dryer and more evaporative conditions on the adjacent land and \n\nshallower marine environments, and with lower sedimentation rates. These conditions \n\nwould have promoted warmer and saline bottom water, rich in magnesium, favorable for \n\npalygorskite and dolomite formation in the deeper-water depositional basin. (4) A sea-\n\nlevel retreat occurred in the Neo-Tethys from approximately 41 Myr ago until the Eocene-\n\n\n\n 41 \n\nOligocene boundary ( MILLER, 2005; BOSBOOM et al., 2011; WANG et al., 2013b ; \n\nBOSBOOM; GUO, 2014). This exposed, reworked, and transported material from a \n\nshallower continental margin to a deeper basin was not enough to increase sedimentation \n\nrates but could explain the small increase in silicate minerals.   \n\n \n\n6.3 A mineralogical evidence of the MECO in the Baskil section? \n\n Our well-dated succession can be used to correlate the mineralogical variations to \n\nglobal climatic changes known to have occurred during the middle Eocene. The global \n\nwarming event that took place during the middle Eocene, also known as MECO, occurred \n\nat approximately 40.5 Myr ago and lasted for almost 500 ka (BOHATY; ZACHOS, 2003; \n\nBOHATY et al., 2009). Despite its clear stable isotopic signature, which was found in the \n\nAtlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans (BOHATY et al., 2009; EDGAR et al., 2010; \n\nPASCHER et al., 2015), as well as in the Tethys (JOVANE et al., 2007; LUCIANI et al., \n\n2010; SPOFFORTH et al., 2010; DAWBER et al., 2011; Savian et al., 2014), the climatic \n\nmechanism responsible for this event are still not well understood. Computer model \n\nprojections, when compared to observed data, fail to explain the long duration of the \n\nwarming conditions, as well as their abrupt end (SLUIJS et al., 2013).  \n\n In the Baskil section, the 40.5 to ~40 Ma interval ranges from a depth of 125 msl \n\nto 163 msl and is clearly marked by increase in smectite (>80%), decrease in illite (<10%) \n\nand palygorskite starts to appear more significantly during and after the event (Figure 12, \n\n19). Additionaly, the clear oxygen isotope (?18O) excursion from benthic and planktonic \n\nforaminifera (GIORGIONI, in prep) confirms the mineralogical signature of the event \n\n(Figure 19). This shift to smectite as the dominant clay mineral not only indicates a \n\npotential change in source area characterized by volcanic material, but also a climatic \n\nchange, where warmer conditions with moderate humidity would favor smectite \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nformation and deposition prior to the MECO peak warming. Furthermore, the appearance \n\nof authigenic palygorskite, shown with palygorskite/illite ratio, is suggested to be product \n\nof changes in the water column possibly related to changes in circulation patterns. The \n\nincrease in palygorskite is concomitant with the global warming event (Figure 19). A \n\ndivergence between the  d18O curves of the shallow- and deep-water dwelling planktonic \n\nforaminifera after the event suggests a more stratified water column in the Neo-Tethys.  \n\n \nFigure 19: Clay mineral ratios and stable oxygen isotopes from planktonic and benthic foraminifera \n(Giorgioni, in prep.) marking the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) in the Baskil section. \n\n \nClay minerals have been used to identify warmer/cooler periods such as the \n\nPETM, the EECO, and the Eocene/Oligocene transition. For example, the increase in \n\nkaolinite content indicates warmer and humid conditions during the PETM at many \n\nlocations, such as North and South Atlantic, Antarctica, New Zealand, China, Egypt, \n\nIsrael, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Spain, and England (ROBERT; CHAMLEY, 1991; \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nROBERT; KENNET, 1994; KAIKO et al., 1996; GAWENDA et al., 1999; GIBSON; \n\nBYBELL; MASON, 2000; ERNST et al., 2006; SCHULTE; SCHEIBNER; SPEIJER, \n\n2011; SOLIMAN et al., 2011; JOHN et al., 2012; BORNEMANN et al., 2014; \n\nPUJALTE; BACETA; SCHMITZ, 2015; CHEN et al., 2016; KEMP et al., 2016). The \n\nEECO proxies were identified in the western Pyrenees and in China, also with an increase \n\nin kaolinite, however towards the end of the period, dryer conditions may have prevailed \n\n( WANG et al., 2013a; PAYROS et al., 2015). The Eocene/Oligocene transition, \n\ncharacterized by cooling climate, is marked by a decrease in kaolinite and smectite and a \n\ncorresponding increase in illite and chlorite (EHRMANN; MACKENSEN, 1992; \n\nDIESTER-HAAS; ROBERT; CHAMLEY, 1996; WANG et al., 2013a; ZHANG; GUO, \n\n2014). The MECO, however, has only been mineralogically characterized at Monte \n\nCagnero (MCA, Italy) and in the western Indian Ocean (ODP Site 711), where an increase \n\nin smectite content has been observed associated with the warming phase (SAVIAN et \n\nal., 2014, 2016). The same samples from the Indian Ocean (ODP Site 711) were analyzed \n\nwith the methods used for this study. The results showed consistency, where smectite \n\nincreases during the MECO, even though calcite was removed through sample \n\npreaparation and only insignificant amount of quartz was present in the less then 2 \u00b5m \n\n(Figure 20). \n\n\n\n 44 \n\n \n\nFigure 20: Increase in smectite integrated peak area and percentage during the MECO interval (after SAVIAN et al., \n2016). \n\n The increase in smectite in the Baskil section is well dated at ~40.5 Ma, based on \n\nthe age model of RODELLI et al. (2017), and thus may be related to the changing climatic \n\nconditions during the MECO. Moreover, this is the first evidence of palygorskite \n\nappearance during the event. Clay mineral ratios were employed to correlate major \n\nchanges during the warming periods. Chemically weathered produced smectite and \n\nkaolinite contrasts with physically eroded illite and chlorite, providing a proxy for \n\nchemical weathering, which in turns also shows warmer climate (LIMMER et al., 2012; \n\nPAYROS et al., 2015) (Figure 21).  \n\n  Even though records expressing continental conditions during the MECO are still \n\nscarce, previous studies have shown warm and semi-arid to sub-humid conditions in \n\nwestern North America (METHNER et al., 2016) followed by aridification (BOSBOOM \n\net al., 2014). This is consistent with our results showing an increase in smectite and \n\ndecrease in illite and chlorite, which indicate warmer conditions. Moreover, this clay \n\nmineral assemblage is maintained until ~275 msl (38.5 Myr ago), with the additional \n\nincreasing trend of authigenic palygorskite. This indicates that chemical weathering \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nconditions predominated in the Baskil region also after the MECO, accompanied by dryer \n\nperiods and paleoceanographic changes. Further work is necessary to verify the \n\nrelationship between the MECO and the paleoceanographic evolution of the region. \n\nHowever, this is the first study showing a possible change in the water column right after \n\nthe MECO event in the Neo-Tethys and coincides with previous works showing dryer \n\nconditions after the event. \n\n \nFigure 21: Clay mineral ratios showing that warmer conditions were maintained after the warming event \nwith chemical weathering (ChW) regime on land until approximately 38.5 Ma.  \n\n7. Conclusions \n\nThis study shows that non-clay and clay minerals variations along a well-\n\npreserved sedimentary section provide reliable proxies for detrital source areas and \n\nweathering regimes. Moreover, the appearance of authigenic minerals were used as an \n\nindicator of changes in the water column conditions, which was the first occurrence \n\nregistered during a global warming period. The dominant condition of abundant well-\n\n\n\n 46 \n\ncrystallized illite in the lowermost interval of the studied section (interval I) changed \n\ngradually to a smectite dominant interval (interval II), coinciding with the onset of  the \n\nMiddle Eocene Climatic Optimum. This is interpreted as from a change in source area, \n\nfrom a metamorphic to magmatic rocks, in combination with changes from physical to \n\nchemical weathering. Additionally, increasing sedimentation rates indicate increased \n\nerosion from a warmer and more humid climate on land at the beginning of interval II. \n\nThe smectite content slightly decreased after 40 Ma, but its dominance was maintained \n\nuntil 38.5 Ma. In addition, the uppermost interval (interval III) shows lower sedimentation \n\nrates, slight increase of silicates, accompanied by increase in weathered illite and \n\nespecially palygorskite and dolomite. This indicates a change in the source area providing \n\npreviously weathered illite, and changes in the water column that favored the formation \n\nof palygorskite and dolomite. The hypothesis tested was supported by the data, which \n\nshowed an increase in smectite during a warmer period. The mineralogical evolution of \n\nthe Baskil section reflects how source-areas and weathering regimes changed through \n\ntime on land, how environmental changes occurred concomitantly on the continent and \n\nin a restricted ocean, and how these changes can be related to global (i.e. MECO) and/or \n\nlocal to regional processes (Figure 22). \n\n\n\n 47 \n\n \n\nFigure 22:Mineralogical evolution in the Baskil section representing climatic conditions on land and \npossible changes in the water column during the studied interval (box diagram after FAGEL, 2007).  \n\n\n\n 48 \n\n8.

Remove organic matter (OM) and CaCO3 from sample by adding the following \nchemicals per 10 cc of sediment: \n\n\u2022 50 ml water \n\u2022 20 ml H2O2 \n\u2022 20 ml Morgan\u2019s Solution \n\n \nStir and let sit for 4 to 5 days (depending on the amount of OM and CaCO3  \n \nIf a lot of organic matter or CaCO3 is present, the mixture will bubble.  If a vigorous \nreaction is observed, double the amount of Hydrogen Peroxide and Morgan\u2019s \nsolution after the reaction has quieted.  If it still reacts after several hours, add more \nH2O2 and Morgan\u2019s Solution (always together as the Morgan\u2019s Solution acts as a \nbuffer) in increments of 10 ml each every 3 hours until reaction is complete. \n\n \n2. After 2 days, transfer sample solution to centrifuge tube in the following manner: \n \u2022 fill test-tube with sample solution, centrifuge 5 min. @ 1000-1500 rpm \n \u2022 pour off clear liquid and add more solution \n \u2022 when all of the sample is concentrated at the bottom of the tube and the last of the \n\nliquid is discarded, then wash the sample \n \u2022 use a squeeze bottle to squirt Morgan\u2019s Solution hard enough to suspend all \n\nsediment (or stir with plastic stirrer making sure to wash the sediment off the stirrer \nback into the test tube) \n\n \u2022 centrifuge for 5 minutes @ 1000-1500 rpm and pour off liquid \n \u2022 do this twice \n \n3. Wash sample into a beaker using 50 ml 2% Na2CO3 \n\n\u2022 cover with a watch glass and stir with magnetic stirrer for 5 min. at the highest \nspeed magnet will allow (the highest speed at which the vortex created is preserved) \n\n \u2022 re-concentrate all sample in test tube (as above) using 0.01% Na2CO3 to rinse \nresidue in beaker into tube \n\n \n4. Thoroughly suspend sediment in tubes with 0.01% Na2CO3 \n\n\u2022 centrifuge for 3 min. at 850 rpm (set time so that the centrifuge spins for 3 min at \n850 rpm, it may take 25 sec to get to 850 rpm);  \n\u2022 all material still in suspension has a settling diameter of 2 \u00b5m or less \n\u2022 pour off suspension into large beaker and save \n\u2022 the sediment is again suspended (using 0.01% Na2CO3), centrifuged again, and the \nsupernatant is poured into the same appropriate large beaker \n\u2022 begin with different tube from centrifuge each time you suspend the clay, because \nthe sediment settles slightly while you re-suspend the other samples \n\n \u2022 repeat until supernatant is clear \n \u2022 if after 10 runs the supernatant isn\u2019t clear, it probably contains colloidal material, \n\nso stop \n\u2022 save silt and sand concentrated in the test tube in a plastic bottle and put aside \n\n \u2022 wash out test tube \n \u2022 concentrate (as in #2) the suspended clay (from large beaker) back into test tube \n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n5.  Mg saturate the clay by washing (as in #2) 4 times with MgCl2 (1000-1500 rpm for 5 \nmin.); discard the liquid \n \n6. Remove excess salts by washing clay (as in #2) 2 times with distilled water (1000-\n1500 rpm for 5 min.); discard the liquid \n \n7. Spread clay evenly over a plastic or glass insert in the aluminum holder, layer should \n\nbe nearly translucent when held up to the light \n \n8. Glycolate slides: \n \u2022 place aluminum holder with clay on a \u201choly\u201d plate or screen over a bowl of ethylene \n\nglycol \n \u2022 put this in an oven at 65\u00b0C for 1-4 hours \n \u2022 remove from oven and place glycol/holy plate/sample set up in a dessicator for 18-24 \n\nhours. This expands the smectite lattice so that smectite can be distinguished from \nchlorite and vermiculite. \n\n \n9.
