SAT-MAR methods are an important way of \n\naddressing water scarcity challenges by reusing water of impaired quality, such as \n\nwastewater, converting it into a reliable resource. They can be quite useful in water resource \n\nmanagement, particularly in semi-arid regions, helping to face decrease of rainfall and long \n\ndrought periods resulting from climate change. In this context, SAT can also present itself as \n\na relatively simple and inexpensive complementary method of treatment, lessening possible \n\nenvironmental problems. \n\nThe research presented in this dissertation was developed in the framework of EU 7th \n\nFramework Project MARSOL project which aims to demonstrate the reliability of MAR \n\nprocesses to face water scarcity problems in Southern Europe and Mediterranean regions. \n\nSeveral soil characterization, soil-column and batch experiments were conducted at National \n\nLaboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) using a soil collected in S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines, \n\none of the projects demonstration sites where SAT-MAR basins are to be constructed using \n\ntreated wastewater as primary infiltration water source. \n\nThese experiments aimed to characterize the soil behaviour at lab scale by simulating \n\ninfiltration basin conditions, determining hydraulic characteristics and contaminant retention \n\ncapacities. Natural soil results obtained were later compared to those obtained for a soil \n\nmixture produced in LNEC. This soil mixture will act as a reactive layer to be installed in the \n\nbottom of the infiltration basins, increasing capacity to retain certain contaminants detected in \n\ninflow water, but also keeping acceptable hydraulic conductivity without hindering the water-\n\nsoil interaction. The referred mixture results from a combination of cheap and easily available \n\nmaterials with the natural soil. \n\nUnregulated emerging contaminant problematic was also discussed, focussing in \n\npharmaceutical compounds, considering the type of source water used in these experiments \n\n\u2013 S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines (SBM) wastewater treatment plant effluent. High concentration \n\nof ammonia and sulphates were measured and traces of 17 pharmaceuticals were detected. \n\nSBM natural soil that was used in experiments is a loamy sand composed of 81.91% sand, \n\n15.95% of silt and 2.14% clay, having quartz, calcite, montmorillonite and anorthite as major \n\nmineral constituents and traces of dolomite, illite, kaolinite and hematite. It has 24.02% of \n\ncarbonates percentage, low organic matter content (2.66%), average bulk density of 1.44 \n\ng/cm3 and average porosity of 43.6%. \n\nFive soil-column experiments were conducted in this soil for different time lengths, testing \n\ndifferent methods of column assembling, thickness, soil packing, saturation conditions and \n\ninjection method (Column 1 to 5 \u2013 C1 to C5). For the three different soil mixtures produced, \n\nfour soil column experiments were conducted (Column 6 to 9 \u2013 C6 to C9). Outflow samples \n\nwere collected for the experiments that used wastewater as injection source (C3 to C5 and \n\nC8 and C9) \u2013 metals, nitrogen cycle components, major ions and pharmaceuticals were \n\nanalysed. Pharmaceuticals were not measured for C3 inflow. \n\nConsidering hydraulic behaviour for natural soil, and taking as reference the first day of \n\nexperiment, C5 showed highest flow rate (1.504 cm3/min) and permeability (2.536 m/d) while \n\n\n\nIII \n\nC4 showed the worst results (0.363 cm3/min and 0.589 m/d). For soil mixture behaviour, C6 \n\nhad higher flow rate and permeability (7.722 cm3/min 12.579 m/d) but this one along C7 \n\nsuffered high soil washing out along the experiment. \n\nConcerning inflow water quality, from 32 parameters analysed (excluding pharmaceuticals), \n\nC3 had 17 values above the limit of recovery (LOR), C4 and C5 had 17 and C8 and C9 had \n\n26. For pharmaceuticals, from the 24 parameters analysed, 14 were above LOR in C4 and C5 \n\ninflow, while in C8 and C9, nine parameters were above LOR. \n\nComparing the outflow in terms of quality, and more precisely average concentration of metals, \n\nfrom 11 parameters considered, C3 has 7 parameters where outflow concentration is higher \n\nthan inflow, while C4 has 6 and C5 has 9. C8 has only 3 parameters in which outflow average \n\nconcentration surpasses the inflow, although inflow sample presents a slight enrichment in \n\ncertain metals when compared to other columns. Phosphorus shows the highest reduction in \n\nall columns. For nitrogen cycle components, ammonia showed high concentration at inflow \n\nand a reduction at outflow for all columns, while nitrites present low concentration at inflow \n\nand high concentration at outflow. C3, C5 and C8 show higher average concentration of \n\nnitrates when compared to inflow. Concentration at outflow in C8 reaches 140.46 mg/L, a very \n\nhigh value when compared to C3 (0.86 mg/L) and C5 (6.51 mg/L). Concerning major ions, for \n\nthe 7 parameters considered, 4 were above inflow concentration C4, C5 and C8. C8 \n\nexperiment shows a worse overall behaviour for these parameters than that with higher \n\naverage concentrations. \n\nSoil samples were collected and analysed after C3 and C5 experiments stopped. C3 shows \n\nalmost equal concentration of boron, copper and zinc in top and bottom sections, but boron \n\nconcentrations were lower. Ammonia showed higher concentrations when compared with \n\nnitrates and nitrites, being heavily retained in the soil top section, while nitrates where not \n\ndetected in both sections and nitrites showed very small concentration. Phosphorous and \n\nphosphates show higher concentrations in the soil top section. From the set of selected \n\npharmaceuticals, none showed concentrations above LOR in C3. For C5, boron and copper \n\nshowed slightly lower concentrations to those detected in C3, and ammonia shows a high \n\nconcentration on the top section. Nitrates and nitrites were also detected in higher \n\nconcentration on column top section. Phosphorous and phosphates show lower \n\nconcentrations in both sections when compared to C3 and sulphates where not detected in \n\nboth sections. Caffeine was the only detected pharmaceutical compound in C5. \n\nBatch experiments were also conducted in both natural soil and soil mixture. For the set of 32 \n\nparameters analysed in the inflow and outflow water of natural soil batch, eight showed a \n\ndecrease in concentration in the outflow when compared to inflow. Highest percentage of \n\nremoval is observed in aluminium, followed by iron, and the lowest in sodium. Nitrites, \n\nsulphate, barium, calcium, chromium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, vanadium and chloride \n\nshowed an increased concentration in outflow. 14 of 24 pharmaceuticals analysed had values \n\nabove LOR, only seven of those were persistent and were detected in the outflow (propanolol, \n\nbezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen, indometacin and carbamazepine). For the \n\npersistent compounds, lowest removal rate was detected for naproxen while seven of the \n\ncompounds showed 100% removal (atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, sotalol e \n\npentoxifillin). For the same set of parameters, 25 were detected in soil mixture inflow water \n\nwhile only 20 were detected in the outflow water. Ammonia presented the highest adsorbed \n\namount and copper, zinc, nitrites, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and chloride \n\n\n\nIV \n\nshowed an increase of concentration in outflow. Removal was higher in antimony and lowest \n\nin lithium. For the pharmaceuticals, 14 were above LOR in inflow water and only 1 in the \n\noutflow water. 100% removal rate was observed in atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, \n\npropranolol, sotalol, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen \n\nand pentoxifyllin. Carbamazepine showed recalcitrant behaviour, but a relatively high removal \n\nrate (86.3%). \n\nTransport of ammonia, nitrates and nitrites was modelled in Hydrus-1D to understand the \n\nconditions inside the column in continuous saturated conditions using C3 and C4 data. \n\nSimulations showed ammonia being retained on the top of the column whereas nitrites showed \n\na small increase in concentration as ammonia concentration decrease. Then nitrites \n\nconcentration decrease at the column bottom while nitrates concentration increased. \n\nSaturation indexes (Log SI) were determined at inflow and outflow for calcite, dolomite and \n\nhematite in C3, C4 and C8 by hydrogeochemical speciation in PHREEQC. C3 inflow water is \n\nunsaturated in calcite and dolomite and it\u2019s in equilibrium with hematite. C4 inflow solution is \n\nclose to stability concerning dolomite and calcite while high Log SI for hematite was \n\ndetermined, showing saturation in this iron oxide. C8 inflow solution is slightly unsaturated in \n\ncalcite and dolomite, and hematite Log SI is showing oversaturation at inflow. For all columns, \n\noutflow solutions are saturated in hematite, and oscillate from unsaturation to saturation in \n\ncalcite and dolomite along the experiment. Inverse modelling in PHREEQC was also used in \n\nC3 to understand phase transfers that occur between inflow solution and the soil media along \n\nthe experiments under invariable saturation conditions. \n\nThe natural soil shows some suitability to be used as a base infiltration layer for the SAT-MAR \n\ninfiltration basins in what concerns infiltration capacity, but is expected to show some problems \n\nin the long term, with a continuous decrease of permeability. The soil mixture resulted in a \n\nmore pervious material with a good long term hydraulic behaviour, with better response to \n\ncycles of saturation and non-saturation allowing the oxygenation of the soil. The sequential \n\nuse of oxic/anoxic conditions is the best approach to ensure maximum attenuation efficiency, \n\nsince some elements degrade better in oxic conditions, and others are degraded under \n\nanaerobic conditions. Complementarily, the increase of organic matter favoured the \n\nretention/degradation of most pharmaceuticals studied, as well as metals. It was also \n\nobserved that high pH favoured the retention of metals into the soil. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Soil-aquifer treatment; MAR; Pharmaceuticals; Metals.  \n\n\n\nV \n\nResumo \nAs metodologias de tratamento solo-aqu\u00edfero (SAT) s\u00e3o geralmente aplicadas no \u00e2mbito da \n\nrecarga controlada de aqu\u00edferos (MAR) tendo como principal objetivo aumentar a \n\ndisponibilidade de \u00e1gua no aqu\u00edfero, melhorando a qualidade da \u00e1gua injetada. Apresentam-\n\nse como forma de enfrentar os desafios inerentes \u00e0 escassez atrav\u00e9s da reutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua \n\nde fraca qualidade, como \u00e1guas residuais com tratamento secund\u00e1rio. Podem ser \u00fateis na \n\ngest\u00e3o integrada de recursos h\u00eddricos, particularmente em regi\u00f5es semi\u00e1ridas e em zonas \n\nsujeitas \u00e0 diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o com longos per\u00edodos de seca resultantes das altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nclim\u00e1ticas e apresentar-se como um m\u00e9todo complementar de tratamento de \u00e1gua pouco \n\ndispendioso, permitindo diminuir poss\u00edveis problemas ambientais decorrentes da descarga \n\nno meio ambiente. \n\nOs trabalhos apresentados foram desenvolvidos no \u00e2mbito do projeto MARSOL que tem \n\ncomo objetivo demonstrar a fiabilidade dos processos MAR como forma de enfrentar os \n\nproblemas de escassez de \u00e1gua no sul da Europa e Mediterr\u00e2neo. Ensaios de caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo solo, em coluna e do tipo batch foram realizados no Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional de Engenharia \n\nCivil (LNEC), num solo recolhido na \u00e1rea de estudo de S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines (SBM) \n\nonde ser\u00e3o constru\u00eddas bacias SAT-MAR. \n\nEstes pretenderam caracterizar o comportamento do solo \u00e0 escala laboratorial, simulando as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es existentes nas bacias, determinando caracter\u00edsticas hidr\u00e1ulicas e capacidade de \n\nreten\u00e7\u00e3o de contaminantes. Os resultados obtidos para o solo natural foram comparados com \n\num segundo conjunto de ensaios realizados para um solo de mistura produzido no LNEC. \n\nEste solo de mistura actuar\u00e1 como camada reativa, instalada na base das bacias, permitindo \n\no aumento da capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de contaminantes, assegurando uma permeabilidade \n\naceit\u00e1vel. \n\nA problem\u00e1tica dos contaminantes emergentes foi analisada, dando-se especial aten\u00e7\u00e3o a \n\ncompostos farmac\u00eauticos. A an\u00e1lise da presen\u00e7a destes compostos em \u00e1guas tratadas e para \n\nconsumo assume cada vez maior relev\u00e2ncia particularmente em pa\u00edses desenvolvidos, \n\ntendo-se mesmo observado comportamento recalcitrante ap\u00f3s tratamento. A qualidade do \n\nefluente da ETAR de SBM foi analisada sendo registada elevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de am\u00f3nia e \n\nsulfatos, sendo tamb\u00e9m detetados 17 compostos farmac\u00eauticos. \n\nO solo natural de SBM \u00e9 uma areia argilosa composta por 81,91% de areia, 15,95% de silte \n\ne 2,14% de argila, apresentando-se quartzo, calcite, montmorilonite e anortite como principais \n\nconstituintes minerais e evidenciando tra\u00e7os de dolomite, ilite, caulinite e hematite. Possui \n\n24,02% de carbonatos, baixo teor de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica (2,66%), densidade m\u00e9dia de 1,44 \n\ng/cm3 e porosidade m\u00e9dia de 43,6%. \n\nCinco ensaios em coluna foram realizados para este solo tendo-se testado diferentes \n\nm\u00e9todos de montagem, espessura de solo, procedimentos de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o, varia\u00e7\u00f5es das \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de satura\u00e7\u00e3o e m\u00e9todo de inje\u00e7\u00e3o (Coluna 1 a Coluna 5 \u2013 C1 a C5). Para o conjunto \n\nde tr\u00eas solos de mistura com diferentes composi\u00e7\u00f5es realizaram-se quatro ensaios em coluna \n\n(Coluna 6 a Coluna 9 \u2013 C6 a C9). Amostras foram recolhidas \u00e0 sa\u00edda das colunas onde foi \n\ninjetado efluente tratado (C3 a C5 e C8 e C9) tendo-se analisado metais, componentes de \n\nciclo de azoto, i\u00f5es maiores e compostos farmac\u00eauticos. \n\n\n\nVI \n\nConsiderando o comportamento hidr\u00e1ulico do solo natural, e tendo como refer\u00eancia o primeiro \n\ndia de ensaio, C5 mostrou maior caudal \u00e0 sa\u00edda (1,5 cm3/min) e permeabilidade (2,5 m/d), \n\nenquanto C4 mostrou o pior desempenho (0,4 cm3/min e 0,6 m/d). Para o solo de mistura, C6 \n\napresentou maior caudal e permeabilidade (7,7 cm3/min e 12,6 m/d). C6 e C7 apresentaram \n\nforte mobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de part\u00edculas, com perda de espessura e cria\u00e7\u00e3o de cavidades. \n\nNo que concerne \u00e0 qualidade da \u00e1gua injetada nas colunas, dos 32 par\u00e2metros analisados \n\n(excluindo os compostos farmac\u00eauticos), C3 apresentou 17 valores acima do limite de \n\ndete\u00e7\u00e3o (LD), C4 e C5 apresentaram 17 e C8 e C9 apresentaram 26. Nos 24 compostos \n\nfarmac\u00eauticos analisados, 14 estavam acima do LD em C4 e C5, e 9 em C8 e C9. \n\nEm termos de qualidade, mais precisamente na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia de metais, de 11 \n\npar\u00e2metros considerados a C3 obteve 7 onde a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de sa\u00edda foi maior que a de \n\nentrada, enquanto a C4 teve 6 e a C5 teve 9. A C8 teve apenas 3 par\u00e2metros onde a \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia de sa\u00edda ultrapassa a de entrada, apesar de ser observ\u00e1vel um ligeiro \n\nenriquecimento em certos metais \u00e0 entrada em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com as restantes colunas. O \n\nf\u00f3sforo mostra a maior redu\u00e7\u00e3o em todas as colunas. Para os componentes do ciclo de azoto, \n\na am\u00f3nia apresentou elevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 entrada e uma significativa redu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 sa\u00edda em \n\ntodas as colunas, enquanto os nitritos apresentaram elevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o na sa\u00edda \n\ncomparativamente aos valores de entrada. C3, C5 e C8 mostram uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia \n\nmais elevada de nitratos \u00e0 sa\u00edda em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de entrada. Este par\u00e2metro \n\nregista 140,46 mg/L \u00e0 sa\u00edda da C8, um valor muito elevado quando comparado com C3 (0,86 \n\nmg/L) e C5 (6,51 mg/L). Nos i\u00f5es maiores, para o conjunto de 7 par\u00e2metros, 4 estavam acima \n\nda concentra\u00e7\u00e3o registada \u00e0 entrada em C4, C5 e C8. C8 mostra um comportamento pior \n\npara esses i\u00f5es com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00e9dias mais elevadas \u00e0 sa\u00edda. \n\nAmostras de solo foram analisadas ap\u00f3s a conclus\u00e3o dos ensaios C3 e C5. C3 mostra \n\nsemelhante concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de boro, cobre e zinco nas sec\u00e7\u00f5es superior e inferior. A am\u00f3nia \n\nmostrou elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es, sendo fortemente retida na se\u00e7\u00e3o superior do solo, \n\nenquanto nitratos n\u00e3o foram detetados em ambas as se\u00e7\u00f5es e os nitritos mostraram muito \n\nbaixa concentra\u00e7\u00e3o. F\u00f3sforo e fosfatos mostraram concentra\u00e7\u00f5es mais elevadas na sec\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsuperior do solo. Dos compostos farmac\u00eauticos analisados, nenhum apresentou \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es acima dos LD na C3. Na C5, boro e cobre apresentaram concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nligeiramente mais baixos para os detetados na C3. A am\u00f3nia, nitratos e nitritos mostram uma \n\nmaior concentra\u00e7\u00e3o na sec\u00e7\u00e3o superior da coluna. O f\u00f3sforo e fosfatos mostram \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es inferiores em ambas as sec\u00e7\u00f5es quando comparados com a Coluna 3 e n\u00e3o \n\nforam detetados sulfatos em ambas as sec\u00e7\u00f5es. A cafe\u00edna foi o \u00fanico composto farmac\u00eautico \n\ndetetado na C5. \n\nNos ensaios batch realizados no solo natural, para o conjunto de 32 par\u00e2metros analisados, \n\noito mostraram uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o entre a entrada e a sa\u00edda. A maior \n\npercentagem de remo\u00e7\u00e3o foi observada para o alum\u00ednio, seguido do ferro total. A mais baixa \n\nfoi registada para o s\u00f3dio. Nitritos, sulfatos, b\u00e1rio, c\u00e1lcio, cr\u00f3mio, magn\u00e9sio, mangan\u00eas, \n\nn\u00edquel, van\u00e1dio e cloreto mostraram aumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o na sa\u00edda. 14 de 24 compostos \n\nfarmac\u00eauticos analisados apresentaram valores acima dos LD \u00e0 entrada mas apenas sete \n\napresentaram comportamento persistente e foram detetados na sa\u00edda. Os restantes \n\ncompostos apresentaram 100% de remo\u00e7\u00e3o. Para o solo de mistura, 25 dos 32 par\u00e2metros \n\n\u2013 em que se incluem metais, i\u00f5es maiores e compostos do ciclo do azoto \u2013 apresentaram \n\nvalores acima dos LD na \u00e1gua de entrada. Apenas 20 foram detetados na \u00e1gua de sa\u00edda. A \n\n\n\nVII \n\nam\u00f3nia apresentou a maior quantidade adsorvida e o cobre, zinco, nitritos, c\u00e1lcio, magn\u00e9sio, \n\nmangan\u00eas, pot\u00e1ssio e cloreto mostraram um aumento de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 sa\u00edda. A remo\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfoi maior em antim\u00f3nio e menor para o l\u00edtio. Dos 24 f\u00e1rmacos considerados, 14 estavam acima \n\ndo LD \u00e0 entrada e apenas 1 na \u00e1gua de sa\u00edda. As taxas de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de 100% foram \n\nobservadas para 13 desses compostos e 1 mostrou comportamento recalcitrante. \n\nO transporte da am\u00f3nia, nitratos e nitritos foi modelado atrav\u00e9s do software Hydrus-1D tendo \n\ncomo objetivo compreender as condi\u00e7\u00f5es dentro da coluna em regime de satura\u00e7\u00e3o cont\u00ednua \n\nusando dados de C3 e C4. As simula\u00e7\u00f5es demonstraram a reten\u00e7\u00e3o da am\u00f3nia na parte \n\nsuperior da coluna. Os nitritos mostraram um pequeno aumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o com a \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de am\u00f3nia. Em seguida, a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o em nitritos decresce na \n\nparte inferior da coluna enquanto a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nitratos aumentou ao longo da coluna. \n\nOs \u00edndices de satura\u00e7\u00e3o da calcite, dolomite e hematite foram determinados por especia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhidrogeoqu\u00edmica em PHREEQC tanto para as solu\u00e7\u00f5es de entrada como de sa\u00edda da C3, C4 \n\ne C8. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o de entrada da C3 apresenta subsatura\u00e7\u00e3o em calcite e dolomite e est\u00e1 em \n\nequil\u00edbrio com a hematite. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o de entrada da C4 est\u00e1 perto do equil\u00edbrio relativamente \n\n\u00e0 calcite e dolomite e evidenciando satura\u00e7\u00e3o em hematite. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o de entrada C8 \u00e9 \n\nsubsaturada em calcite e dolomite, e sobressaturada em hematite. Para todas as colunas, as \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e0 sa\u00edda est\u00e3o saturadas em hematite, e oscilam ao longo dos ensaios entre a \n\nsubsatura\u00e7\u00e3o e a satura\u00e7\u00e3o em calcite e dolomite. A modela\u00e7\u00e3o inversa com base nos dados \n\nda C3 permitiu compreender as transfer\u00eancias de fase que ocorrem entre uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nentrada e o solo em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de satura\u00e7\u00e3o cont\u00ednua. \n\nEm conclus\u00e3o, o solo natural mostra alguma aptid\u00e3o para ser utilizado nas bacias SAT-MAR, \n\npodendo ocorrer a longo prazo colmata\u00e7\u00e3o e diminui\u00e7\u00e3o capacidade de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o. O solo de \n\nmistura apresentou maior permeabilidade e comportamento hidr\u00e1ulico mais regular a longo \n\nprazo, com melhor resposta aos ciclos de satura\u00e7\u00e3o/oxigena\u00e7\u00e3o, permitindo a oxigena\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ncoluna de solo. A varia\u00e7\u00e3o das condi\u00e7\u00f5es de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o resulta numa maior efici\u00eancia na \n\natenua\u00e7\u00e3o de um maior espectro de elementos, j\u00e1 que alguns s\u00e3o degradados em ambiente \n\noxidante. Concluiu-se tamb\u00e9m que o aumento da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica favorece a \n\nreten\u00e7\u00e3o/degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da maioria dos compostos farmac\u00eauticos estudados, assim como de \n\nmetais. Verificou-se ainda que o pH elevado favoreceu a reten\u00e7\u00e3o de metais no solo. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Tratamento solo-aqu\u00edfero; Compostos farmac\u00eauticos; Metais. \n\n  \n\n\n\nVIII \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \nAcknowledgments ..................................................................................................................

Introduction \nWater scarcity is currently a concerning issue, particularly in semi-arid regions, and presents \n\nitself as a global challenge to human populations. As climate change starts to be a more \n\npressing problem that tends to result from the decrease of rainfall and long drought periods \n\nhindering water availability in both surface reservoirs and aquifers, groundwater management \n\nprocesses represent reliable solutions for assuring water supply in affected regions. In these \n\nclimate change scenarios it is important for groundwater management entities to find \n\ninnovative methodologies to maintain the sustainability of this resource. This where the \n\napplication of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) together with Soil-aquifer Treatment (SAT) \n\nmethodologies, where the usage of recycled water (or reclaimed water) is promoted, can \n\nultimately result in positive impacts by solving scarcity and environmental problems. \n\nOne of the main water sources for MAR is treated wastewater. Instead of direct discharge to \n\na surface waterbody, this water may be injected into the aquifer. As it is a continuous supply \n\nof water, its reuse can represent a solution to the stress induced by increased demand, \n\nallowing for an integrated management with other types of supply, lessening impacts on the \n\noverall resource. \n\nThis dissertation focus on the use of Soil-Aquifer Treatment methodologies, at laboratory \n\nscaled experiments, with the purpose of understanding the increase in water quality induced \n\nby using specific soil types as depurative layer, giving important instructions for real scale \n\nSAT-MAR structures management. \n\n \n\n1.1. Framework of this dissertation \n\nThis dissertation was developed in the context of an European Union 7th Framework Program \n\nproject named MARSOL - Demonstrating Managed Aquifer Recharge as a Solution to Water \n\nScarcity and Drought (www.marsol.eu) that is being developed in the Water Resources and \n\nHydraulic Structures unit of the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering\u2019s Hydraulics and \n\nEnvironment department, in partnership with other European institutions and small to medium \n\nenterprises (SMEs). \n\nAs described in the Document of Work of MARSOL project, the main purpose is to \n\ndemonstrate that MAR is a sound, safe and sustainable strategy that can be applied with great \n\nconfidence and therefore offering a key approach for tackling water scarcity in Southern \n\nEurope and the Mediterranean regions that are facing the challenge of managing its water \n\nresources under conditions of increasing scarcity and concerns about water quality. Already, \n\nthe availability of fresh water in sufficient quality and quantity is one of the major factors limiting \n\nsocioeconomic development. Innovative water management strategies such as the storage of \n\nreclaimed water or excess water from different sources in MAR schemes can greatly increase \n\nwater availability and therefore improve water security. For this, eight field sites were selected \n\nthat will demonstrate the applicability of MAR using various water sources, ranging from \n\ntreated wastewater to desalinated seawater, and a variety of technical solutions. Targets are \n\nthe alleviation of the effect of climate change on water resources, the mitigation of droughts, \n\nto countermeasure temporal and spatial misfit of water availability, to sustain agricultural water \n\nsupply and rural socio-economic development, to combat agricultural related pollutants, to \n\nsustain future urban and industrial water supply and to limit seawater intrusion in coastal \n\nhttp://www.marsol.eu/\n\n\n2 \n\naquifers. Results of the demonstration sites will be used to develop guidelines for MAR site \n\nselection, technical realization, monitoring strategies, and modelling approaches, to offer \n\nstakeholders a comprehensive, state of the art and proven toolbox for MAR implementation. \n\nFurther, the economic and legal aspects of MAR will be analysed to enable and accelerate \n\nmarket penetration. The MARSOL consortium combines the expertise of consultancies, water \n\nsuppliers, research institutions, and public authorities, ensuring high practical relevance and \n\nmarket intimacy. \n\nIn summary, MARSOL aims to (1) demonstrate at 8 field sites that MAR is a safe and \n\nsustainable strategy to increase the availability of freshwater under conditions of water \n\nscarcity, (2) improve the state of the art of MAR applications to enable low cost high efficiency \n\nMAR solutions that will create market opportunities for European Industry and SMEs (MAR to \n\nmarket), (3) promote the advantages of MAR by tailored training and dissemination programs \n\nto enable and accelerate market penetration and (4) deliver a key technology to face the \n\nchallenge of increasing water scarcity in southern Europe, the Mediterranean and other \n\nregions of the world. \n\nThe project is divided into 17 Work Packages (WP) guided by three Activity Lines (AL): \n\n? Activity Line 1 or \"Horizontal Activities\" consists of Project Management (WP 1) and \n\nDissemination, Exploitation &amp; Training Activities (WP 2) \n\n? Activity Line 2 covers the technical work performed at all the DEMO sites and includes \n\n\"Demonstration Sites\" Work Packages (WP 3 to WP 10). \n\n?

Dissertation structure \n\nBesides this introductory section this dissertation is divided in six other sections: \n\nSection 2 synthetises a brief literature review on the main processes on MAR and explains \n\nthe objectives of SAT processes. In Section 2 a special attention is given to the problem of \n\nemerging contaminants in the environment in particular in water, presenting a set of actual \n\nconcerns and describing other projects that address this issue. \n\nSection 3 describes the geological and hydrogeological background of the study area, as well \n\nas the main problems resulting from the discharge of wastewater and the possible use of this \n\nwater supply in MAR processes by insuring that environmental conditions are enhanced by \n\nuse of SAT. \n\nSection 4 is the core of this dissertation and thoroughfully describes the laboratorial apparatus \n\nfor all the experiments conducted for soil characterization, short and long term hydraulic \n\nbehaviour, parameters analysed and both water and soil sampling procedures. In this section \n\nthere is also the presentation of the methodologies and criteria used for the creation of soil \n\nmixture, an extensive description of the results achieved in soil characterization experiments, \n\nsoil-column experiments and batch experiments conducted both in natural soil and soil \n\nmixtures. \n\nSection 5 presents the numerical modelling processes at soil-column scale. A brief description \n\nof the software used is presented, as well as input data for column models. Output information \n\nconcerning compound transport is summarized, as well as water speciation and inverse \n\nsolution in geochemistry. \n\nSection 6 compares Section 4 laboratory experiment results between natural soil and soil \n\nmixtures in terms of hydraulic behaviour and contaminant retention, allowing for the selection \n\nof the most suitable reactive layer. \n\nFinally, Section 7 summarizes the main conclusions of this dissertation offering a set of \n\nrecommendations concerning the reactive layer creation and operation procedures. \n\nExperiments limitations are also briefly discussed and suggestions on future research are \n\ngiven. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n1.3. Objectives \n\nThe main objective of the research developed is, in general terms, to improve the environment \n\nconditions in the wastewater discharge area by increasing quality using Managed Aquifer \n\nRecharge through the usage of Soil-Aquifer Treatment (SAT). These methodologies are \n\npresented as a reliable complementary water treatment process and a solution, not only for \n\nwater scarcity, but also environmental problems. \n\nThe application/use of SAT techniques requires an advanced knowledge of the \n\npurification/decontamination capacities of the soil and aquifer media that will act as a filter. In \n\nthis sense, several soil characterization and soil-column experiments were conducted in the \n\ngroundwater laboratory located in the Hydraulics and Environment Department of the National \n\nLaboratory for Civil Engineering (LASUB \u2013 LAborat\u00f3rio de \u00c1guas SUBterr\u00e2neas) in soils \n\ncollected in the area of the infiltration basin installation. The objective of these experiments \n\nwas to characterize the soil behaviour at lab scale but in similar conditions to those of \n\ninfiltration scale. Also, simple batch experiments were conducted to define the maximum \n\nretention capacity of a set of pre-selected contaminants. \n\nDepending on the results obtained, both in contaminant retention capacity \u2013 mainly by the \n\ncomparison between the inflow and outflow parameters concentration \u2013 and by the hydraulic \n\nbehaviour, a soil mixture can be produced and again tested in the soil-column experiments \n\nand batch experiments. The objective of this soil mixture is to increase the soil capacity to \n\nretain certain contaminants analysed in the inflow water, but also keeping hydraulic \n\nconductivity that allows an easily infiltration process without hindering the water-soil interaction \n\nprocesses. This soil mixture will act as a reactive layer to be installed on the bottom of the \n\ninfiltration basins. This procedure \u2013 real scale experiments \u2013 will not be conducted during the \n\ntime of conclusion of this dissertation, but the information collected will be fundamental for this \n\nstage. \n\nA second stage is to be carried, dedicated to the modelling of the transport and retention of \n\ncontaminants at column scale by using the Hydrus-1D software and water speciation with \n\nPHREEQC. This will allow the visually understanding of these processes that occurs in the \n\nsoil-column given certain soil and contaminant parameters. \n\nIn summary, this dissertation includes the following objectives: \n\n? Characterization of the infiltration basin soil properties. \n\n? Characterization of the physical and chemical behaviour of these soils as a filtrating \n\nand purifying layer, both under soil-column and batch experiments conditions. \n\n? Criteria definition, given the results obtained in the experiments, of the soil mixture for \n\ncontaminant retention capacity increase. \n\n? Numerical modelling of the chemical processes that occur at soil-column scale and \n\nsimulation of transport in saturated and unsaturated media. \n\nInitially two areas were defined for the application of SAT-MAR methodologies \u2013 S\u00e3o \n\nBartolomeu de Messines and Melides Lagoon. Due to the large amount of data gathered and \n\nthe lack of time to analyse it taking into account MARSOL project deadlines, this dissertation \n\nfocused only in one of the study areas, S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines. \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n2. State of the Art \nIn this section a brief literature review will be presented regarding the main subjects of this \n\ndissertation. Section 2.1 focus on Managed Aquifer Recharge while Section 2.2 presents \n\nsome important aspects of the Soil-Aquifer Treatment, the main methodology studied in this \n\ndissertation. The following sections refer to the main aspects, problems and advantages of \n\nthese methods, namely clogging, water origin and quality, ending with a section dedicated to \n\nEmerging Contaminants (EC) problematic. \n\n \n\n2.1. Managed Aquifer Recharge \n\nIn general terms, Dillon et al. (2009) defined Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) as the \n\npurposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit, \n\nwhile Gale (2005) defines MAR as an intentional storage and treatment of water in aquifers.  \n\nThe term of Artificial Recharge has been the most common expression in the past to describe \n\nthese processes. However adverse connotation of the \u201cartificial\u201d term resulted in the \n\nabandonment of this expression to avoid hindering the public acceptance of these processes. \n\nThe term enhanced recharge has also been suggested by the scientific community. It\u2019s also \n\neasier to distinguish between the natural process of rainfall water infiltration and the \n\nanthropogenic induced process recharge, defining it as a well-organized, effective and \n\nefficient project with specific objectives. \n\nAs described by the United States National Research Council (NRC, 1994) report on artificial \n\nrecharge1 the main purpose of this process is to replenish an aquifer by storing water \n\nunderground in times of surplus to meet water demand in times of shortage through infiltration \n\nmethods such as surface spreading, recharge wells or by altering the natural conditions. \n\nBesides this use, this processes can also control sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers and \n\nmigrant contaminant plumes, land subsidence resulting from declining groundwater levels or \n\nmaintain streams base flow. These benefits can also be extended to impediment of soil \n\nerosion by increase of infiltration. DINA-MAR (2010) inventoried other environmental \n\napplications of MAR as a result of the water table rise in the recovery of groundwater \n\ndependent ecosystems such as caves, wetlands, prairies and marshes. Other uses may be \n\ntemperature control for industry procedures using the stable temperatures of subsurface or \n\nthe use of saline aquifers for potable water storage (Murray et al., 2007). \n\nAccordingly to Gale (2005), the benefits of an effectively managed aquifer can be of relevance \n\nin (1) poverty reduction &amp; livelihood stability, (2) economic and health risk reduction, (3) \n\nincreased agricultural yields resulting from reliable irrigation, (4) increased economic returns, \n\n(5) distributive equity by more accessible water to everyone and (6) reduced vulnerability. In \n\nsmall communities MAR may represent a cheap and safe water supply which will be essential \n\nin semi-arid and arid areas, and has been a common practice for centuries in several \n\ntechniques. \n\nThe human activities which enhance aquifer recharge can be put into three categories (Dillon \n\net al., 2009): (1) unintentional, which result from the deep seepage under irrigation areas or \n\n                                                \n1 At the time of report publication \u201cartificial recharge\u201d was the commonly expression used to refer MAR. \n\n\n\n6 \n\nleaks from water pipes, (2) unmanaged, that includes stormwater drainage wells and septic \n\ntank leach fields and (3) managed, through specific mechanisms/devices. \n\nGale (2005) defined 15 types of MAR device classification, to which DINA-MAR (2010) added \n\n8 more (variations of irrigation systems that result in an increase of water return to the aquifer \n\nand MAR in urban areas techniques) \u2013 Table 1. Some of these system schemes are \n\nrepresented in Figure 1. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 List of MAR devices (adapted from DINA-MAR, 2010) \n\nSystem Type of device \n\nDisperse Infiltration ponds \n\nInfiltration channels \n\nSoil-aquifer treatment techniques \n\nInfiltration fields \n\nRecharging by irrigation channels \n\nChannels Retaining dykes and reservoirs \n\nPermeable dykes \n\nDiversions \n\nBed scarification \n\nSub-surface/subterranean dykes \n\nPerforated dykes \n\nWell Qanats (subterranean galleries) \n\nOpen infiltration wells \n\nDeep wells and mini-probes \n\nProbes \n\nDolines, collapses, etc. \n\nASR/ASTR \n\nFiltration Filtration banks in riverbeds (RBF) \n\nInter-dune filtration \n\nSubterranean irrigation \n\nRain Unproductive rainwater capture \n\nSustainable drainage urban systems Accidental conduction and sewerage \nrecharge \n\nSustainable Urban Drainage Systems \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Different MAR schemes (adapted from Murray et al. 2007) \n\n \n\nThese systems can be interconnected depending on the managing necessities, and can \n\nrepresent an integrated solution to surface/groundwater solution \u2013 Figure 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 MAR (Dillon et al. 2009) \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAs described by Dillon et al. (2009), the induced storage by MAR in aquifers has some \n\nadvantages but also some disadvantages when compared to surface storing. The main \n\nadvantage is the land area required which is very small compared with a surface dam. This \n\nrepresents an increase of area for rural and urban uses. MAR structures can be dimensioned \n\naccordingly to use, and they need considerably smaller surface areas when compared to dams \n\nthat usually require a suitable valley, making it almost impossible to place them near urban \n\nareas. In the comparison of capital costs, a MAR structure is, by far, less expensive than a \n\ndam, and requires less investigation investment. \n\nA surface reservoir is usually more exposed to evaporation losses, algal problems and \n\nmosquitoes and has a large contamination potential. In contrast, a below ground reservoir has \n\na smaller supply rate and intake of water, but allows, by SAT processes, a natural \n\ndecontamination. Also, as referred by Bouwer (2002) dams interfere with river ecology and \n\ncan flood sensitive areas, with cultural, religious, archaeological, recreational and scenic \n\nimpacts. Other advantages of aquifer storage is that the first doesn\u2019t need to relocate \n\npopulation, does not tend to have large silt accumulations, does not and produce large \n\nquantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. \n\nOn the other hand MAR applications may require great expertise for it to be successful, which \n\ncan represent an obstacle for its development. Also there is the concern about the possible \n\ndamage of these processes in the aquifer and the environmental effects of the fluctuating \n\ngroundwater levels, particularly in dependent ecosystems and, in shallow aquifers, the \n\nincrease of aquifer vulnerability to contamination (Murray et al. 2010).These factors may be \n\nan obstacle at entry point for MAR implementation as a wide technique for managing \n\ngroundwater, but so far it has been applied with success in several countries. \n\nDillon et al. (2009) defined five critical elements for a successful MAR project: \n\n? Demand \u2013 within an economic scale, demand has to provide the revenue stream to \n\npay for the water supply cost elements of a project. As an example in reclaimed water \n\nprojects, the decline in discharge of treated effluent to sea may provide motivation for \n\ninvestment in MAR; \n\n? Source \u2013 enough water for recharge must be available so it allows to build up a buffer \n\nstorage to meet reliability and quality requirements; \n\n? Aquifer \u2013 the media has to have enough storage capacity and be able to retain water; \n\n? Detention Storage \u2013 there should be enough space for water detainment to enable the \n\ntarget volume of recharge to be achieved and also enough space for treatment process \n\nafter recovery if necessary; \n\n? Management capability \u2013 This means enough knowledge acquired both in \n\nhydrogeological and geotechnical and in terms of water storage and treatment design. \n\nSeveral projects applied MAR methods with success. In Portugal, the 6th Framework Program \n\nGABARDINE project started in 2005, with the main objective of exploring the viability of \n\nsupplementing existing water resources in semi-arid areas with alternative sources of water \n\nthat could be exploited based on an integrated water resources management approach, tried \n\nto apply MAR technologies in the Southern region - Algarve. The main purpose of this \n\napplication was to rehabilitate the groundwater quality of a heavily nitrate contaminated aquifer \n\n\u2013 Campina de Faro \u2013 resulting from several years of inappropriate intense agricultural uses \n\n(Diamantino, 2009). The water source used was from surface runoff and it was infiltrated into \n\n\n\n9 \n\nbasins built in the bed of a perennial stream. Other experiments using injection large diameter \n\nwells were also conducted in the area. \n\n \n\n2.2. Soil-aquifer Treatment \n\nIt is well known that the natural water recycling happens through the global hydrological cycle, \n\nwhich is expected to suffer major variations due to the climatic changes. As anthropogenic \n\npressures increase over water resources, it is important that a change in attitude towards \n\nwater use occurs. It\u2019s in this context that the development of water reuse techniques is in \n\nimplementation, being the growing research and application of Soil-aquifer Treatment (SAT) \n\ntechniques a good example. Accordingly to Bouwer (2000), planned local water reuse may be \n\nimportant, as the discharge of sewage effluent is becoming increasingly difficult and \n\nexpensive, since treatment requirements become more strict to protect the quality of the \n\nreceiving waters, making economically attractive to treat and reuse rather than discharge. \n\nAbel (2014) defines SAT as a land-based MAR technology adopted as a way to reliably \n\nenhance water resources and reduce indiscriminate discharge of treated wastewater to water \n\nbodies. Physical, chemical and biological processes improve the quality of wastewater effluent \n\nduring infiltration through soil strata. Bdour et al. (2009) characterizes this process as a geo-\n\npurification system in which the aquifer is recharged with partially treated wastewater through \n\nthe unsaturated zone before mixing with native water. In terms of methodologies, a treated \n\neffluent is intermittently placed in recharge basins, allowing for the infiltration into the ground \n\nfor the recharge of the aquifers, and as the effluent moves through the soil and the aquifer it \n\nundergo quality improvement through the previously referred processes (Miotli?ski et al. 2010) \n\n- Figure 3. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 SAT system infiltrating water to an unconfined aquifer (Miotli?ski et al. 2010) \n\n \n\nThe SAT process provides mechanical filtration of suspended particles and, resulting from \n\nintermittent aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the soil under the basin, nitrification and \n\ndenitrification is facilitated, allowing the partial or total removal of organic and inorganic \n\nnitrogen and organic carbon, phosphorus, non-aromatic organic, trace metals or pathogens \n\n\n\n10 \n\n(Miotli?ski et al., 2010). The removal process can be controlled by managing wetting and \n\ndrying cycles, and it\u2019s highly dependent on the quality of available water. \n\nSimply put, NRC (1994) indicates that the soil and underlying aquifer have a great capacity to \n\nremove contaminants and pathogens, by reduction or removal of these constituents, as the \n\nwater moves towards bigger depths in the aquifer. This represent an important step in reducing \n\npotential health risks at the time of recovery. \n\nThe pre-treatment of wastewater effluent can be made before spreading, to deliver the \n\nrequired quality either by regulations or for optimum operational purposes. SAT can be flexible \n\nconcerning the wastewater quality and pre-treatment as primary, secondary or tertiary \n\neffluents can be used (Abel, 2014). \n\nNRC (1994) determined that the ideal soil for SAT system balances the need for a high \n\nrecharge rate (coarse-textured soils) with the need for efficient contaminant adsorption and \n\nremoval (fine-textured soils). It should posess the suitable physical and chemical properties to \n\nachieve sufficient contaminant removal (Abel, 2014). For the stated reasons SAT systems are \n\nvery site specific. Also wastewater effluent should be considered together with site \n\ncharacteristics to evaluate the feasibility of SAT (Cha et al., 2004). \n\nAbel (2014) studied the effects of several factors in SAT success of removal using primary \n\neffluent, such as effect of pre-treatment of primary effluent used, impact of hydraulic loading \n\nrate and soil type, wetting and drying cycles, biological activity and temperature and redox \n\nconditions. It was concluded that the pre-treatment of effluent alone resulted in 90% of \n\nsuspended solids, 70% of dissolved organic carbon, 98% of phosphorous. Also, low hydraulic \n\nloading rates and fine particles soil can, with longer contact time and presence of adsorption \n\nprocesses, allow the reduction of nitrogen, while wetting/drying cycles helped in E. coli and \n\ntotal coliforms removal. Temperature and redox conditions also affect SAT performance, with \n\nhigh nitrogen removal at 15-25\u00baC temperature interval (89.7 to 99%) with an increase of \n\nnitrates and phosphates removal with temperature increase, indicating that lower viscosity \n\nincreases adsorption. Higher contaminant removal was achieved with aerobic operating \n\nconditions, which suggested that aeration prior to infiltration process (with wetting and drying \n\ncycles) can improve SAT success. Malolo (2011) also showed temperature effect in ammonia \n\nnitrogen oxidation, which was maximum (76%) in soil-column experiments using primary \n\neffluent at temperatures of 20\u00baC. Phosphorous also shown a dependence on temperature. \n\nBekele et al. (2011) demonstrated that secondary treated wastewater was infiltration through \n\na 9 m-thick calcareous vadose zone during a 39 month managed aquifer recharge (MAR) field \n\ntrial resulted in the reductions of the average concentrations of phosphorous (30%), fluoride \n\n(66%), iron (62%) and total organic carbon (51%). \n\nNRC (1994) also demonstrates the example of the nitrogen cycle in SAT in which nitrogen is \n\nquickly transformed to nitrates, very mobile in soils under normal conditions but can be \n\nremoved by denitrification under anaerobic conditions. Other components such as phosphorus \n\nare reduced by sorption and precipitation, and trace metals, with exception of boron, are \n\nattenuated and can be precipitated in the soil, especially under alkaline and aerobic conditions. \n\nSAT cannot substitute water treatment processes simply because processes by which \n\nremoval occur are not completely efficient in natural settings, resulting from the significant \n\nnumber of ever changing factors, and not all constituents are retained or degraded. This is the \n\n\n\n11 \n\nreason that NRC (1994) indicate that this processes is dependent on management strategies, \n\nand with adequate monitoring, a SAT system may help to reduce treatment costs. \n\nAlso, public acceptance of this type of treatment is fundamental for the implementation, and \n\nsome communities still perceive recycled water as disgusting regardless to the extent of \n\nadvanced water treatment the recycled water suffered (Abel, 2014). Socio-economic, cultural \n\nand religious factors can influence the use of this type of water, being education and \n\ncommunity programmes fundamental to compete against false notions of unsafety and \n\nimpurity (Bouwer, 1991). Many regions that face stress in their renewable source of water \n\nhave not exploited this technology in full potential, so public outreach programs addressing \n\nthese issues should be created to bridge the gap between institutions and end users (Abel, \n\n2014). \n\nPresently there are SAT facilities functioning worldwide. One example of successful \n\napplication is Alice Springs SAT system, Australia. Operation started at 2008 and consists in \n\nfour infiltration basins. As a result of this system operation Miotli?ski et al. (2010) observed \n\nthat phosphorus removal is quite effective, and there is a freshening of the Quaternary aquifer \n\nwith groundwater getting more suitable for agricultural purposes in terms of salinity which can \n\nbe recovered in the future. \n\n \n\n2.3. Clogging \n\nAs referred by Bouwer (2002), the main problem in infiltration MAR systems is clogging of the \n\ninfiltrating surface that results in a decrease of infiltration rates. This phenomenon outcomes \n\nfrom physical, biological and chemical processes. \n\nIt\u2019s important, in the context of scaled laboratory experiments of MAR structures, to understand \n\nthese processes as a way to comprehend the soil and aquifer behaviour, the effects of inflow \n\nwater, and also to achieve the best conditions to avoid inviable projects. \n\nMartin (2013) states that a MAR scheme will invariably experience clogging and where the \n\nselected method involves an injection and recovery bore (aquifer storage and recovery \n\nprocess or ASR, see Figure 1) the risk of clogging is potentially greater. In general, this \n\nprocess often results, in the case of infiltration basins, of minerals precipitation and gas \n\nentrapment in soil, biofilm formation and by algae and sediment accumulation and deposition. \n\nHutchison et al. (2013) presents the effects of this phenomena in spreading facilities, such as \n\nreducing infiltration rates, diminishing the effectiveness of soil-aquifer treatment, necessity of \n\nregular maintenance (with basin flow ripping and draining) and in an extreme scenarios \n\nleading to site abandonment. Accordingly to Martin (2013), clogging can be divided into four \n\ntypes: (1) chemical, with elements precipitation and matrix dissolution, (2) physical that \n\ncomprehend the suspended solids and interstitial fines migration, (3) mechanical such as \n\nentrained air binding and (4) biological with algae growth, iron or sulphate reducing bacteria. \n\nThe clogging layer in infiltration basins is usually not very thick (Hutchison et al., 2013) and is \n\ncomposed essentially of suspended solids, algae, microbes, dust and salts. This layer will \n\ndecrease permeability and make the basin bottom unsaturated. According to the author, two \n\ntypes of clogging layers exist: (1) upper layer with particulate matter, algae and/or microbes \n\nabove the original sediment surface, and (2) lower layer composed with the native sediment \n\nwith organic and inorganic solids trapped in the pore space. \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn this type of structures, besides water quality, other parameters will influence the extent of \n\nclogging. One of the most relevant is the particle size of the soil media, where the fine grained \n\nsediments will create a clogging layer faster than coarse graded, although the extent of this \n\nlayer may be bigger in coarse graded sediment media. Ponding depth is also a factor for \n\nclogging effect with a higher compaction of clogging layer occurring in higher depths. The \n\nloading rate (or rate at which water is applied to the soil surface) is also important to consider \n\nwith lower hydraulic rates to achieve better results, especially in loading cycles where the \n\nbasins are allowed to dry 50 percent of the time. Finally, vegetation in the pond will contribute \n\nto the decrease of soil permeability, considering not only root exudates but also effect from \n\nleafs. On the other hand root expansion may help in soil loosening (Hutchison et al., 2013). \n\nConcerning the chemical clogging, the main problems are related to the precipitation of iron \n\noxides and hydroxides as well as calcium carbonate and usually are related to other forms of \n\nclogging. Accordingly to Martin (2013) many geochemical reactions are catalysed by bacteria, \n\nwhich creates a strong correlation to biological clogging, especially in iron and manganese \n\nrich aquifers and soils which, in the presence of oxygen, stimulate microorganisms the \n\nprecipitate iron or manganese oxides and hydroxides. Dissolution is also a factor to instability, \n\nwhere soluble materials such as clays, anhydrite or halite may be dissolved leaving occluded \n\npores that can be filled with insoluble fines creating blockage effects. \n\nPhysical clogging may have similar effects as chemical clogging. In spreading methods, fines \n\nmigration associated with turbulence resulting from water injection pulses, can create fines \n\nsettlement that be consequently suffer larger mobilization in each injection cycle. Concerning \n\nclays, swelling may be the biggest issue, which block pores and result in severe hydraulic \n\nconductivity reductions. Also, temperature variations may also affect infiltration due to the \n\nchanges in water viscosity, which may be seasonal. Higher viscosity from lower temperatures \n\nresults in lower infiltration rates. Benamar (2013) also concluded that physical clogging (as \n\nwell as filtration) depends on particle concentration and flow conditions. \n\nBiological clogging may result from growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, usually from \n\ninjection water and it\u2019s directly associated with the amount of nutrients in solution, which \n\naccumulate themselves in biofilms that repel fluid and block pores. \n\nClogging problems can be prevented by controlling the injection water quality, by suspended \n\nsolids removal, pH managing or dissolved oxygen control, although it does not solve \n\nmicrobiological activity clogging related problems. Also, extended ponding periods enhance \n\nsoil clogging whereas wetting and drying cycles will ultimately help in reduce the effects of \n\nclogging layer (Hutchison et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n2.4. MAR water sources and quality \n\nAs stated by EU (2001), although the natural and artificial recharge involves basically the same \n\nphysical, geochemical and biological processes, in the second case the infiltration rate is \n\nusually higher thus affecting the water content in the unsaturated zone. Also, depending on \n\nthe origin, the concentrations of solute and contaminants in the water are higher when \n\ncompared to rainwater, and most certainly will have different chemical composition from the \n\naquifer water. In this scenario it\u2019s important to have into account the chemical and \n\nmicrobiological impacts on the native groundwater. \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe origin of water used in recharge processes can be diverse, from municipal wastewater, \n\nindustrial wastewater, stormwater runoff and irrigation return flow. Gale (2005) extended the \n\nlist of potential source of water for MAR, each with its own particularities in terms of quality: \n\nperennial stream/river/canal and intermittent flood flow, and storage dams. \n\nAccordingly to NRC (1994) the injection water may be affected by several factors, directly \n\ndependent of its origin. For storm water runoff, besides its quantity and intensity, its quality is \n\nhighly dependent on the characteristics of the drainage basin, time since last rainfall event \n\nand season. For irrigation return flow, that presents the widest variation in quality, may be \n\ndependent on the type of culture and the farmer irrigation methods, and this water source is \n\nnot usually subjected to any kind of treatment. \n\nIn the case of wastewater, which represent a very interesting option given its immediate \n\navailability, its quality is related to the treatment processes that it has been subjected to \u2013 \n\nprimary to tertiary treatment. The major constituents of this type of water are quite known, but \n\nless is known about trace constituents (see section 2.5). Also, besides organic compounds, \n\nnitrogen species, phosphorous and pathogen organisms, when water is treated to a higher \n\ndegree, i.e. exposed to chlorine disinfection, the effluent will contain disinfection by-products \n\nwhich, in MAR, may represent a concern if the recovered water is for human consumption. \n\nHenze and Comeau (2008) divided the constituents of wastewater into main categories (Table \n\n2). \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Constituents present in domestic wastewater (adapted from Henze and Comeau, 2008) \n\nWastewater constituents Effects \n\nMicroorganisms Pathogenic bacteria, virus \nand worms eggs \n\nRisk when bathing and eating shellfish \n\nBiodegradable \norganic materials \n\nOxygen depletion in rivers, \nlakes and fjords \n\nFish death, odours \n\nOther organic \nmaterials \n\nDetergents, pesticides, fat, oil \nand grease, colouring, \nsolvents, phenols, cyanide \n\nToxic effect, aesthetic inconveniences, \nbioaccumulation in the food chain \n\nNutrients Nitrogen, phosphorus, \nammonium \n\nEutrophication, oxygen depletion, toxic \neffect \n\nMetals Hg, Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni Toxic effect, bioaccumulation \n\nOther inorganic \nmaterials \n\nAcids, for example hydrogen \nsulphide, bases \n\nCorrosion, toxic effect \n\nThermal effects Hot water Changing living conditions for flora and \nfauna \n\nOdour (and taste) Hydrogen sulphide Aesthetic inconveniences, toxic effect \n\nRadioactivity - Toxic effect, accumulation \n\nAsano and Cotruvo (2004) refer four quality factors for reclaimed wastewater use in MAR: (1) \n\nmicrobiological quality, (2) total dissolved solids (TDS), (3) presence of heavy metal toxicants \n\nand (4) concentration of stable and potentially harmful organic substances. These factors will \n\nhighly influence the pre-treatment and type of more suitable MAR, considering also its \n\npurpose, location and public acceptance, giving that the direct injection of wastewater into an \n\naquifer, for later recovery, can require a more sophisticated approach in pre-treatment. A set \n\nof criteria for groundwater recharge with reclaimed wastewater has been proposed to the State \n\nof California Regional Water Quality Control Boards, which included total nitrogen requirement \n\nof 10 mg/L and 1 mg/L of nitrite. \n\n\n\n14 \n\nConcerning the legislation framework, besides the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) \n\nwhich defines the good chemical, quantitative and ecological status of water bodies, \n\nGroundwater Directive (2006/118/EC) that rules the groundwater chemical status concerning \n\nnitrates, pesticides and other parameters/compounds concentration, there is no official \n\nregulatory legislation to define the characteristics of source water to be used in MAR at \n\nEuropean scale like the previous directives. The Water Framework Directive specifies MAR \n\nas measure to achieve acceptable status but without referring to quality aspects. National \n\nscale legislations start to take into account the MAR processes giving the importance of \n\nregulation in different water uses. According to DEMEAU (2013), several countries have \n\nregulated MAR having as background the European Framework. Spain, defined quality criteria \n\nfor several parameters such as E. coli, TDS, turbidity, and nitrogen/nitrates. Netherlands \n\nWater Act integrates rules for artificial infiltration and protection of infiltration areas and soils, \n\nwhile Switzerland Federal law and Ordinance of water protection regulates MAR installations \n\nand defines the general requirements of groundwater quality affected by infiltration. Germany, \n\nin Groundwater Ordinance, defines values that refer to minimum water quality at the point of \n\nreaching groundwater surface. Previous projects such as AQUAREC (2006) or \n\nRECLAIMWATER (2012) suggested quality requirements for MAR injection water, which \n\nconcern not only parameters like pH, conductivity and TDS but also nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, \n\nphosphate, sulphate, arsenic, boron, cadmium, chloride, chromium, zinc, mercury and lead. \n\n \n\n2.5. Emerging contaminants \n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines emerging pollutants as new \n\nchemicals without regulatory status and which impact on environment and human health are \n\npoorly understood. Use of reclaimed or recycled water is more common nowadays not only in \n\nirrigation but also in MAR/SAT processes (and others that efficiently use this type of water). \n\nAs usage of this source of water increases, the concept of emerging contaminants (EC) starts \n\nto be more of a concern, particularly in economically developed countries where environmental \n\nlaw tends to be more restrictive concerning water quality and the associated uses. \n\nThis results mainly from a more and more detailed view of these waters composition and its \n\nlong term effects in the environment, particularly in the case of treated wastewater, due to the \n\nconsiderable organic and biologic content commonly found in some types of recycled water \n\nsuch as treated wastewater (Henze &amp; Comeau, 2008). \n\nThe emergent contaminant problem, and in particular, the presence of pharmaceuticals in \n\nwater is a more common subject nowadays mainly because of the recent advances in \n\nanalytical chemistry and lower detection limits (Schwab et al., 2005). Although, in the vast \n\nmajority of cases, pharmaceuticals have been detected in natural waters only in nanograms \n\nto micrograms per litre, there is a lack of knowledge of their impact in the middle or long-term \n\non human health as well as the environmental effects, particularly aquatic environments \n\nexposed to these compounds (Deblonde et al., 2011). \n\nThese long term effects to are yet unknown, particularly those resulting from complex \n\npharmaceutical mixtures, and there is an urgent need for risk assessment studies (Schwab et \n\nal., 2005). \n\n\n\n15 \n\nWhile not directly toxic or carcinogenic, the chemicals that enter wastewater by discharges of \n\npharmaceutical industries, hospitals, medical facilities and households (by direct flushing and \n\nby human excreta with unmetabolized compounds) may produce adverse health effects by \n\ninterfering with hormone production or by weakening immune systems (Bouwer 2000). \n\nThere are also records of problems in fauna and flora, namely an increase of bacteriological \n\nresistance to antibiotics and other compounds, increasing risk of disease as well as \n\nreproductive problems detected in aquatic organisms exposed to certain disrupting hormone \n\ncompounds (Strathmann et al., 2010). These are mainly a result of the direct discharge of \n\npharmaceutical compounds in the environment through treated (or poorly treated) \n\nwastewaters and are recently being increasingly addressed in research programs.  \n\nFor these reasons pharmaceuticals and similar compounds should be kept out of water \n\nenvironment as much as possible (NRC, 1994). Directive 2008/205/EC, which regulates the \n\nenvironmental quality standards of a set of priority hazardous substances in surface waters, \n\ndoes not contemplate the regulation of pharmaceuticals. \n\nChristensen (1998) and Webb et al. (2003) conclude that concentrations found in aquatic \n\nmedia for some pharmaceuticals are subsequently transmitted to drinking water and to fish. \n\nHowever, these do not pose significant risk to human health although, accordingly to \n\nCunningham et al. (2009), the effects of chronic exposure to the mixture of these emerging \n\ncompounds should be prevented, possible susceptibility of individuals (particularly in \n\ndebilitated or imunosupressed populations) should be defined, and the efficiency of treatment \n\nmethods for the removal of pharmaceutical in wastewater treatment plants should be \n\nincreased. \n\nIn a literature review by Calisto and Esteves (2009), large discrepancies are observed in the \n\namount of pharmaceuticals removed during the treatment process of the WWTP, indicating \n\nthat some employed methods show removal efficiencies below 10%, and consequently large \n\nquantities of active substances discharged unaltered. In some cases, this justifies a high \n\noccurrence of these compounds in environmental matrices, reinforcing the need to find viable \n\nalternatives to removal through remediation strategies that minimize the impact of this \n\nproblem. With today\u2019s scientific knowledge, these low concentrations of pharmaceutical active \n\ncompounds and other contaminants are, from a toxicological point of view, not harmful to \n\nhumans but their occurrence in ground- or drinking water may not be desirable from a hygienic \n\npoint of view or with regard to the precautionary principle (Heberer, 2002). \n\nRichardson and Bowron (1985) addressed the problem of pharmaceuticals in aquatic \n\nenvironments, considering 200 of these substances. Many would metabolise to innocuous \n\nsubstances (conjugates) which can be hydrolysed during treatment. Biodegradation studies \n\nin 25 compounds that included naproxen, ibuprofen or paracetamol indicated that 14 of them \n\nwere non-biodegradable (that included amitriptyline, chlorhexidine, clofibrate, coideine \n\nphosphate, dextropropoxyphene, erythromycin, meprobamate, methyldopa, metronidazole, \n\nnaproxen, sulphamethoxazole, sulphasalazine, tetracycline and tulbutamide). \n\nIn a more detailed view, Ternes (1998), determined that due to the incomplete removal of drug \n\nresidues during passage through a WWTP, above 80% of the 32 selected pharmaceuticals \n\nwere detectable in at least one municipal sewage treatment plant effluent with concentration \n\nlevels up to 6.3 mg/L (carbamazepine) and thus resulting in the contamination of the receiving \n\n\n\n16 \n\nwaters. It was also concluded that the drugs detected in the environment were predominantly \n\napplied in human medicine; therefore it can be assumed that the load of municipal WWTP \n\neffluents in the surface water highly influences the contamination - Figure 4. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Scheme for the main fates of drugs in the environment after application (STP meaning sewage \ntreatment plant) (adapted from Ternes, 1998) \n\n \n\nHeberer et al. (2011) concluded that several polar organic compounds, including \n\npharmaceuticals, are relevant to MAR in bank-filtration (an efficient natural attenuation \n\ntreatment process for natural surface-water). Compounds such as bezafibrate or, diclofenac \n\nseem to be removed effectively during bank filtration, while others, such as carbamazepine, \n\nclofibric-acid, primidone or propyphenazone are not (Lake Wannsee transect in Berlin, \n\nGermany). Endocrine disrupting compounds including herbicides and one pharmaceutical \n\nwere also detected in surface water, water-supply wells, or drinking water at three bank-\n\nfiltration sites in Nebraska, United States. Pharmaceuticals were also identified at the ng/L-\n\nlevel in Berlin tap water samples (Heberer, 2002). \n\nTeijon et al. (2010) identified in Llobregat delta (Spain), 26 of 100 analysed compounds, where \n\n22 of them were pharmaceuticals and 4 were personal care products (limit of recovery, LOR \n\nof 0.1 \u00b5g/L) in groundwater samples. Water from Depurbaix WWTP showed at effluent higher \n\nvalues than influent and diuretics, blood lipid regulator, beta-blockers, analgesics, antibiotics \n\nand fragrance where detected. In 60% of groundwater samples collected in that study area \n\nsubstances like caffeine, niconite and galaxolide (musk fragrance) were found, rarely \n\nexceeding a few \u00b5g/L. Carbamazepine, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazone have also been \n\nfound in WWTP and groundwater samples above LOR. Teijon et al. (2010) observed that from \n\nthe set of compounds analysed, pharmaceuticals are the most common detected for that area. \n\nIt was also observed that although tertiary treatment efficiently removed some compounds, \n\nothers still been detected in much lower concentration. \n\nIn a database that included drugs for human health and disinfectants and collected \n\nconcentration data for 50 pharmaceuticals, caffeine is the molecule whose concentration in \n\ninfluent was highest (in means 56.63 ?g/L) with a removal rate around 97%, leading to a \n\nconcentration in the effluent that did not exceed 1.77 ?g/L. It was also shown that analgesics, \n\n\n\n17 \n\nanti-inflammatories and beta-blockers are the most resistant to treatment with 30 to 40% of \n\nremoval rate in WWTPs (Deblonde et al., 2011). \n\nYing et al. (2004) detected the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) in sewage \n\neffluents, such as 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, bisphenol A, in concentrations \n\nthat range from nanograms to micrograms and conducted sorption tests to define attenuation \n\nfactors in ASR systems. De Mes et al. (2005) defined EDC, used as oral contraceptives, as a \n\nthreat affecting aquatic life by its estrogenic character, which environmental presence has \n\nbeen identified as a possible cause of adverse trends in reproductive health and prevalence \n\nof cancer in endocrine sensitive tissues \n\nAlthough the issue of emerging contaminants is not likely to be, for now, a problem of major \n\nproportions, Jones et al. (2005) assert it would be prudent to apply in this case, the \n\nprecautionary principle trying to reduce the levels of these compounds before their \n\ndangerousness is proven by monitoring and prevention. \n\nDEMEAU project (7th Framework Programme), which aimed to demonstrate the importance \n\nof MAR concerning water quality impact and safety assurance, compiled a set of emerging \n\nsubstances and their removal rates influence parameters in several matrix. Accordingly to \n\nDEMEAU (2013) 12 pollutants from 40 compounds that represent emerging substances were \n\nselected considering a criteria: (1) commonly found in wastewater &amp; drinking water supplies, \n\n(2) environmental relevance, (3) different chemical and physical properties, (4) cover the range \n\nfrom good to bad elimination by several methods and (5) existence of analytical methods of \n\nmeasuring its concentrations. These 12 substances (benzontriazole, bezafibrate, \n\ncarbamazepine, epoxy-carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, iopromide, metroprolol, \n\nphenazone, primidone, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) were analysed considering the \n\ninfluencing parameters that result in attenuation, like residence time (RT), redox conditions, \n\norganic carbon in sediment and water, attenuation/sorption capacity of sediment, and \n\nexistence of an unsaturated zone and temperature. \n\nFrom the literature review in DEMEAU (2015) it was learned that in MAR processes \n\nBenzotriazole compound removal occurs only in anoxic conditions with RT of 20 days to 1 \n\nyear, with 75 to 85% of removal occurring in 4 months RT with iron/manganese reduction \n\nconditions. Bezafibrate attenuate in oxic to reductive conditions and RT ranging to days to 1 \n\nyear. 40% removal achieved in nitrate reduction conditions and less than 3 months RT. \n\nCarbamazepine, which was found to be recalcitrant in both oxic and in nitrate and manganese \n\nconditions with pour removal, achieved rates of 99% removal in strictly anoxic conditions with \n\nlong RT. Diclofenac removal occurred in different redox conditions and RT from days to \n\nmonths, being insignificantly removed under nitrate and manganese reduction conditions. \n\nEpoxy-Carbamazepine was removed (85%) in the presence of an organic layer at short RT, \n\nalthough the authors indicate that there is little information about this substance behaviour in \n\nMAR systems. Gemfibrozil is highly removed in all conditions and RT from 1 day to 3 months, \n\nwith best rate achieved in high temperatures (97 to 100%). Ioprimide was successfully \n\nremoved both in oxic and anoxic conditions with RT from 1 day to several months. Metoprolol \n\nshows high removal (100%) with long RT of more than 6 moths. Again, little information was \n\ncollected about this substance. Phenazone showed good removal with short residence time \n\nand best results in oxic conditions (91%), although in some cases authors found inconsistent \n\nbehaviour. Primidone was not removed in both oxic and reduction conditions and showed \n\nrecalcitrant behaviour with only 30% removal in long RT. Sulfamethoxazole removal showed \n\n\n\n18 \n\ngood removal rates from 80 to 99% in anoxic conditions. Finally, from the 12 selected \n\nsubstances, trimethoprim removal was achieved both in oxic and anoxic conditions and RT \n\nranging to 1 year, and high success achieved (90 to 100%) with 1 month of RT. In general, \n\nliterature review showed consistency on the attenuation conditions of each compound. \n\nIn this context the authors defined a set of design and planning instructions for the removal of \n\nthese substances, concerning the potential additional water and soil treatment to ensure \n\nattenuations \u2013 Table 3. \n\nTable 3 \u2013 DEMEAU MAR operation instructions (adapted from DEMEAU, 2013) \n\nCompound Aquifer conditions \n\nBenzotriazole In nitrate and iron-manganese reducing conditions and with \nresidence time between 3 and 12 months the maximum \nexpected natural removal is between 50 and 90% \n\nBezafibrate All aquifer conditions ensure > 90% removal \n\nCarbamazepine Removal rates >90% are only expected in aquifer with very \nlong residence time (at least 6 months) and anaerobic \nconditions (sulphate reducing conditions) \n\nDiclofenac All aquifer conditions ensure >90% removal except more \nreducing conditions where the removal is above 50% \n\nEpoxy-carbamazepine Not enough information to identify removal conditions \n\nGemfibrozil All aquifer conditions ensure >90% removal \n\nIopromide All aquifer conditions ensure >90% removal \n\nMetoprolol Not enough information to identify removal conditions \n\nPhenazone Phenazone reaches 100% removal rates in oxic to slight \nanoxic conditions and short residence times \n\nPrimidone It is not removed at any aquifer conditions \n\nSulfamethoxazole Removal rates >90% are only expected in aquifer with very \nlong residence time (at least 6 months) and anaerobic \nconditions or strictly anaerobic conditions (sulphate redox \nconditions) \n\nTrimethoprim All aquifer conditions ensure >90% removal \n\n \n\nConcerning experiments directly correlated with SAT and removal of these substances, Abel \n\n(2014) concluded using soil-column experiments that phenacetin, paracetamol, ibuprofen and \n\ncaffeine were easily removed under various operating conditions. Also, increased biological \n\nactivity allowed for a substantial removal of gemfibrozil, diclofenac, pentoxifylline and \n\nbezafibrate from the primary effluent used, for periods of 240 days. \n\nMansell et al. (2004), in soil-column experiments on silica sand showed that adsorption is the \n\nprimary mechanism of removal for 17?-estradiol, estriol, and testosterone hormones studied, \n\nwith removals of  79.3 \u00b1 2.4%, 84.3 \u00b1 14.6%, and 97.5 \u00b1 1.7%, respectively. It was also \n\nobserved that removal efficiencies were higher on soil containing a higher content of silt, clay \n\nand organic content, demonstrating that SAT is efficient in removing hormones present in \n\nreclaimed water. \n\nAt infiltration basin scale, Life+ ENSAT project, tried to demonstrate the efficiency of a vegetal \n\ncompost-made reactive organic layer. After a set of laboratory experiments this layer was \n\napplied at a full scale MAR system, where several pollutants reduction, usually present in \n\nrecharge water, where taken into account to verify the suitability of the referred reactive layer \n\n\n\n19 \n\n(ENSAT, 2012a). The project focused on recalcitrant compounds that resist to advanced \n\ntreatment processes \u2013 organic micro pollutants. By adding organic matter to the reactive layer \n\nmixed with original soil (Figure 5) installed at the bottom of the pond, biodegradation as well \n\nas adsorption processes can be enhanced. \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Scheme of the reactive layer (adapted from ENSAT (2012b)) \n\nThirteen compounds where selected, including degradation products (8 pharmaceuticals, 4 \n\npesticides and 1 estrogenic compound) and some of them where in Directive 2008/105/EC. \n\nThe substances and the effects suffered by application of a reactive layer are shown in Table \n\n4. \n\nAqueous behaviour of these substances is highly dependent on their physicochemical \n\nproperties, such as molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficients, solubility and acid \n\ndissociation constant. These are key parameters to take into account when considering \n\ntreatment (Caballero, 2010). Octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) describesthehydrophobic \n\n(Kow>2) or hydrophilic (Kow<2) character of a given compound. This important property allows \n\nanticipating the tendency of a compound to adsorb onto suspended solids and sediment \n\nduring infiltration. Hydrophilic compounds remains in aqueous phase due to its affinity with \n\nwater. \n\nAcid dissociation constant (Ka) gives a measure of ability of an acid to donate protons to a \n\nrespective base, the greater this values are the stronger the acid in the solution. These two \n\nparameters together are can give efficient information for estimating the fate of a compound \n\nin a system. \n\nTable 4 \u2013 ENSAT substances and results summary (adapted from ENSAT, 2012) \n\nCompound Use Result \n\nPharmaceuticals \nAtenolol Beta-blocker \n\nNot found in \nrecharge water \n\nCarbamazepine Psychotropic No effect observed \n\n\n\n20 \n\nCompound Use Result \n\nCarbamazepine-\nepoxy \n\nTransformation \nproduct \n\nReduction observed \nby reactive layer \n\neffect \n\nDiclofenac \nNon-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory \nNot found in \n\nrecharge water \n\nGemfibrozil Lipid regulator \nReduction observed \n\nby reactive layer \neffect \n\nIbuprofen \nAnalgesic, anti-\ninflammatory \n\nNot found in \nrecharge water \n\nIbuprofen hydroxyl \nTransformation \n\nproduct \nNot found in \n\nrecharge water \n\nSulphametoxazol Antibiotic \nNot found in \n\nrecharge water \n\nPesticides \n\nDiuron \nHerbicide (phenyl \n\nurea) \nNo effect observed \n\nDIA \nTransformation \n\nproduct \nNot found in \n\nrecharge water \n\nSimazine Herbicide (triazine) No effect observed \n\nSimazine hydroxyl \nTransformation \n\nproduct \nNo effect observed \n\nEstrone Estrone Estrogenic hormone \nNot found in \n\nrecharge water \n\n \n\nDEMEAU (2013) compiled information about the behaviour of some organic pollutants and \n\nalso solubility and mobility information \u2013 Table 5. For example, carbamazepine can be \n\nretarded in the presence of soil organic matter based on laboratory results but field data seems \n\nto relate the removal with dilution processes. Retardation is governed by carbamazepine \n\ndesorption kinetics from adsorbing sites.

Study area characterization: S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines \nIn this section a general characterization of the study area will be presented, addressing \n\nregional geology to hydrogeological factors, water quality and some socioeconomic facts. \n\n \n\n3.1. Global characterization \n\nThe study area is located in the northern limit of Queren\u00e7a \u2013 Silves aquifer system, situated \n\nin the Algarve region, south of Portugal (Figure 6). Geologically, this system is a karstic multi-\n\naquifer, with confined to unconfined layers, limited in the northern contact by Gr\u00e9s de Silves \n\n(sandstone) formation and, in the south, by Jurassic Callovian-Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian \n\nlimestones and marls where the aquifer geological formations can have 270 m of thickness. \n\nKarstification is observed and is only developed to smaller depths, which locally can achieve \n\n200 m. This aquifer system has a complex geometry, reflected in the pattern of the surfacing \n\ngeologic formations, resulting from the tectonic activity that compartmentalized the aquifer \n\nsystem in smaller subsystems with hydraulic connections between them that vary in rate of \n\ngroundwater transferral (Almeida et al., 2000). \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Location of Queren\u00e7a-Silves aquifer system \n\n \n\nMonteiro et al. (2006), Monteiro et al. (2007) and Reis et al. (2007) refer that, besides this \n\ncomplexity in the subsurface media, there is transference between subsystems induced by \n\nstreams, that transfer water from the upstream subsystems to downstream subsystems by a \n\nsuccession of springs and areas of infiltration in the stream beds. Water flow does not occur \n\nexclusively underground, but there is also a superficial component of circulation and hydraulic \n\nconnection between different sectors of the aquifer system. It\u2019s possible to conclude that \n\ncomplex surface/groundwater relations are established, where streams (seasonal or not) \n\nfrequently represent the hydraulic connection between sectors (or subsystems) that otherwise \n\nwould function independently. Figure 7 represents the distribution of receptor (influent) and \n\ndonator (effluent) sections of the main streams that pass through the aquifer. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Influent (blue) and effluent (red) sections of the streams that pass through Queren\u00e7a \u2013 Silves \naquifer system (adapted from Monteiro et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nThe study area is situated near the zone of influence of Ribeiro Meirinho, a tributary of \n\nAlcantarilha stream. This stream upper reaches are located outside the aquifer, in Serra \n\nAlgarvia and flows south throughout the central-western area of Queren\u00e7a-Silves aquifer. \n\nSerra Algarvia are Palaeozoic terrains, composed essentially by impervious lithologies, being \n\nthe main source of water for this stream until it reaches the Jurassic calcareous formations \n\ncomposing the karst aquifer of Queren\u00e7a-Silves (Leit\u00e3o et al., 2014). \n\nReis et al. (2007) refers an influent behaviour in the upstream section of Ribeiro Meirinho and \n\nan effluent behaviour in the downstream area, where it suffers a severe flow reduction when \n\nit reaches the karstic formations, having several sinks located along its riverbed. Ribeiro \n\nMeirinho has no significant flow during most of the year and its watershed upstream from the \n\nnorthern limit of the aquifer system is of small dimension. This stream acts as an hydraulic \n\npassage and transfers water received from northern Palaeozoic formations by surface flow \n\nand/or possible subsurface flow from them to the aquifer system. \n\nWater availability in the region is low, and therefore, the importance of its preservation is clear \n\n(Leit\u00e3o et al., 2014). The average annual recharge of Queren\u00e7a-Silves aquifer, for the period \n\n1941\u20131991, was estimated as 314 mm/year (Oliveira et al., 2008) and 294 mm/year for the \n\nperiod 1979\u20132009 (Oliveira 2011). \n\n \n\n3.2. Local characterization: SBM Wastewater treatment plant \n\nConsidering the global characteristics referred in the previous section and the significant \n\nimportance of the groundwater/surface water relations in the aquifer system, a set of infiltration \n\nbasins was purposed for construction to improve the aquifer recharge that occurs naturally \n\nthrough Ribeiro Meirinho (Lobo Ferreira et al. 2013) by using the treated effluent from S\u00e3o \n\nBartolomeu de Messines Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in the upstream section of the \n\naquifer system \u2013 Figure 8. This generally aims to increase availability by storing excess water \n\nin Queren\u00e7a-Silves aquifer during wet years, allowing for complementary response to the use \n\nof surface water reservoirs in case of long drought periods, assuring continuity in consumer \n\nsupply. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines Wastewater Treatment Plant location \n\n \n\nS\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBM WWTP) treated effluent is \n\ndirectly discharged to Ribeiro Meirinho. The objective of the infiltration basins is to improve \n\nwastewater quality through SAT processes, acting as a complementary treatment process. \n\nSBM WWTP is managed by \u00c1guas do Algarve (AdA), a Portuguese public enterprise, and \n\nwas previously managed by local authority of Silves municipality. It receives mainly urban \n\neffluent for treatment from S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines and serves an average of 4228 \n\ninhabitants. The volume of wastewater treated is about 316891 m3/y (AdA and ERSAR, 2008). \n\nThis infrastructure has secondary treatment and a disinfection process by ultraviolet radiation \n\n(UV) \u2013 Figure 9. UV disinfection (a good alternative to chemical disinfection), basically \n\ninactivates bacteria and viruses by exposing microorganisms to electromagnetic radiation that \n\ndisrupts its genetic material and interferes with reproduction process (NRC, 1994). This \n\nprocess allows for the disinfection by-products resulting from transformation of chemical \n\ndisinfection products to be greatly reduced. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 SBM WWTP UV treatment infrastructure \n\n \n\nAfter treatment, the water is directly discharged to Ribeiro Meirinho stream \u2013 Figure 10. \n\n \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Point of discharge of SBM WWTP to Ribeiro Meirinho stream (blue line on the map) \n\n\n\n26 \n\nConcerning water quality, this effluent shows expected variability. Data is from \u00c1guas do \n\nAlgarve (AdA) from effluent monitoring, which control several parameters such as pH, COD, \n\nBOD, phosphates, nitrogen, chloride and E. coli, is frequently published. Graph 1 to Graph 4 \n\nshows parameter concentration for the period of 2009 to 2014 for samples collected at point \n\nof discharge. Values are compared to the maximum acceptable concentrations for wastewater \n\nat discharge established (emission limit values - ELV) in Legislative Decree 236/98, except for \n\nTotal Coliforms which reference value corresponds to maximum recommended value (MRV) \n\nfor drinking waters. \n\nIn Appendix 1 is the table showing the parameter concentrations for samples collected at point \n\nof discharge published by \u00c1guas do Algarve. \n\nFrom the collected data it\u2019s possible to observe at Graph 1 that BOD and COD concentrations \n\nare often above the ELV, mainly during summer months, while Graph 2 shows that pH values \n\nfor the considered period respects the ELV interval (6 to 9), without showing evidence of \n\nseasonal pattern. \n\n \n\nGraph 1 \u2013 BOD and COD concentration at SBM WWTP point of discharge \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nGraph 2 \u2013 pH at SBM WWTP point of discharge \n\n \n\nGraph 3 shows that N total is often above ELV at SBM WWTP point of discharge, with an \n\nevidence of seasonal effects with higher concentrations in the summer months, except for the \n\nyear of 2013. P total show values below ELV except for March 2011. \n\n \n\nGraph 3 \u2013 Total nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations at SBM WWTP point of discharge \n\n \n\nFinally, Graph 4 presents the Total Coliforms (TC) and Total Suspended Solids. While the first \n\nparameter (TC) presents a concentration higher than MRV for certain periods of the year, it is \n\nvery clear that TSS does not respect the ELV in most of the samples at point of discharge. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nGraph 4 \u2013 Total suspended solids and total coliforms at SBM WWTP point of discharge \n\n \n\nThis WWTP shows, for the selected period of available data some problems in the effluent \n\ntreatment. Note that a comparison between the WWTP affluent and effluent parameter \n\nconcentrations for the determination of elimination percentage is not possible due to affluent \n\nparameters concentration not being available. The Legislative Decree 152/97 refers that this \n\ncomparison is to taken into account when determining the quality of effluent at discharge point. \n\nAlso there is no available/published information for metals, total hydrocarbons or detergents, \n\nwhich are also referred in Legislative Decree 236/98 as control parameters for the effluent \n\nquality. \n\nConsidering the type of effluent treated in S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines WWTP, which is \n\nmainly urban, pharmaceuticals were considered in this study. As reported in Section 2.5, this \n\ntype of contaminants is commonly found in wastewater. To understand, the extent of the \n\nproblem in a small population, several wastewater analysis where conducted in different field \n\ncampaigns in different conditions. Pharmaceuticals and other emergent substances are not \n\nmonitored by \u00c1guas do Algarve. \n\nThe first campaign was led in May of 2014, and several parameters where measured, \n\nincluding pharmaceuticals \u2013 Table 6. Sample analyses were conducted in an external \n\nlaboratory and the measured pharmaceuticals correspond to a fixed set of compounds and \n\nwhere not pre-selected which include several types of these substances, from anti-\n\ninflammatory to hormones. The remaining parameters measured were determined accordingly \n\nto Section 4.2.3 set of parameters considered and common in wastewater. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTable 6 \u2013 May 2014 campaign results \n\nParameter Units \nLimit of \n\nRecovery \n(LOR) \n\nConc. \n \n\nParameter Units \nLimit of \n\nRecovery \n(LOR) \n\nConc. \n\nAmmonia (NH4) mg/L 0,05 17,3  Clofibrate \u00b5g/L 0,02&lt;0,02 \n\nNitrates mg/L 0,27&lt;0,27  Caffeine \u00b5g/L 0,02 0,14 \n\nNitrites mg/L 0,005 0,0269  Lincomycin \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01 \n\nSulphate (SO4\n2-) mg/L 5 35,4  Metoprolol \u00b5g/L 0,06&lt;0,06 \n\nBoron mg/L 0,01 0,059  Monensin \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01 \n\nCopper mg/L 0,001 0,0072  Oleandomycin \u00b5g/L 0,02&lt;0,02 \n\nZinc mg/L 0,002 0,055  Pentoxyfillin \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01 \n\nAminopyrine \u00b5g/L 0,05&lt;0,05  Primidone \u00b5g/L 0,04&lt;0,04 \n\nCyclophosphamide \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01  Progesterone \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01 \n\nDapsone \u00b5g/L 0,05&lt;0,05  Propranolol \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01 \n\nErythromycin \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01  Roxithromycin \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01 \n\nEthinyl estradiol \nEE2 \n\n\u00b5g/L 0,5&lt;0,50 \n \n\nSpiramycin \u00b5g/L 0,05&lt;0,05 \n\nPhenazone \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01  Sulphadimidine \u00b5g/L 0,05&lt;0,05 \n\nFenofibrate \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01  Tiamulin \u00b5g/L 0,01&lt;0,01 \n\nFenoterol ng/l 0,02&lt;0,02  Trimethoprim \u00b5g/L 0,02&lt;0,02 \n\nCarbamazepine \u00b5g/L 0,02 0,33  Estrone ng/l 0,1&lt;0,10 \n\nNote: parameters in bold represent pharmaceuticals; concentrations in bold represent values \n\nabove LOR; Conc. \u2013 concentration \n\n \n\nFrom the set of 32 parameters analysed in SBM WWTP effluent, only 8 where above LOR. \n\nLow values of nitrates, boron copper and zinc where detected and relatively high \n\nconcentrations of sulphate and ammonia where measured.

Other parameters had the inverse behaviour with an increase of concentration \n\non the outflow. \n\n\n\n31 \n\nAppendix 2 presents all measured pharmaceuticals in the campaigns. Note that in Section 4 \n\nother wastewater analysis results will be presented for SBM WWTP effluent, as this water was \n\nused in the laboratory soil-column and batch experiments. \n\nThis WWTP serves an aging population, where accordingly to INE (2011) 28% of the \n\npopulation is in the age group of >64 years old and 51.6% is in the age group of 25 to 64 years \n\nold. An aged population may be the main factor for the presence of unmetabolized \n\npharmaceuticals in wastewater in this study area, where there is also a local healthcare unit. \n\nTo date it is unknown if this units sewage is treated independently. \n\nAlso, Algarve see its population increase significantly during Summer season because of its \n\nwarm weather, so there may be a seasonal factor in the presence of pharmaceuticals in \n\nwastewater. \n\n  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n4. Laboratory experiments \nIn this section, the laboratory experiments conducted are descript and the results are \n\npresented. In addition to the soil-column and batch experiments, soil granulometry, organic \n\nmatter percentage, carbonate percentage, cation exchange capacity and clay type were also \n\ndetermined for the natural soil (results presented in section 4.3.1.1). Some parameters were \n\nalso determined for soil mixture \u2013 results in section 4.3.2.1. \n\n \n\n4.1. Soil characterization methods \n\nSeveral experiments were conducted in LASUB for the determination of soil characteristics. \n\nThe granulometric characterization of the soil was made following the procedure \n\nrecommended in Norma E196 LNEC (1966). The soil was air dried and quarted to achieve a \n\nrepresentative sample. After quarting and removal of the organic matter visible at naked eye, \n\nthe soil was passed by the 0.063 mm in a washing process. The below 0.063 mm fraction \n\n(plus water) was collected in a cup and left to settle. After settle, this fraction was left to dry \n\nand was latter weighted. The above 0.063 mm fraction was dried at 40\u00baC to be, after drying, \n\npassed by another sieving process. The sample was inserted in the sieves tower composed \n\nof thirteen sieves with decreasing diameter of holes (4, 2.8, 2, 1.4, 1, 0.71, 0.5, 0.355, 0.25, \n\n0.18, 0.125, 0.09, 0.063 mm) from the top of the tower down to a catchment pan. This tower \n\nis installed in a vibrating plate. The sample was sieved for a period of 30 minutes. After that, \n\nthe fraction retained in each sieve was collected and weighted. \n\nThe granulometric analysis of the fine fraction (<0.063 mm) of the soil was carried out with the \n\nuse of laser diffraction instrument that consists of an optical unit, which collects the information \n\nfrom the scattered light when a laser is passed through the sample, determining the size of \n\nthe particles in the sample. The procedure consists of dispersing the fine fraction in water that \n\nwill pass by the system. \n\nOrganic matter (OM) percentage was determined by incineration of this fraction in the ceramic \n\noven at 600\u00baC. By comparing the weight of sample before and after incineration, this \n\npercentage was calculated. \n\nCarbonates percentage followed a similar method, as the sample was mixed with a strong \n\nacid (HCl) to destroy the carbonated fraction of the soil. After soil-acid mixture the sample was \n\nleft to settle and the pH in the soil solution was measured (Figure 11). Deionized water was \n\nadded to the soil solution until the acid neutralization. When neutralization was achieved the \n\nsamples were dried and weighted. The comparison of the soil weigh before and after this \n\nprocess allowed for the determination of carbonates percentage. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 pH determination previous to soil neutralization procedure \n\n \n\nSoil clay minerals composition was also determined in LNEC laboratories by difractogram. \n\nThis process follows the Norma E403 LNEC (1993), where two difractograms are carried out \n\nin the fine fraction (<0.063 mm) of soil sample, one to verify the presence of expanding clays \n\n(montmorillonite) and the other in a fraction heated up to 550\u00baC degrees for 30 minutes for \n\nkaolinite identification. \n\nCation Exchange Capacity (CEC) was also determined in an external laboratory. This intrinsic \n\nproperty of the soil material describes the total number of exchangeable cation charges (Hillel, \n\n1998). It\u2019s usually expressed in miliequivalents of cations per 100 grams of soil and depends \n\nnot only on clay content but also on clay type. The cation exchange phenomenon affects the \n\nmovement and retention of ions in the soil as well as flocculation-dispersion processes of soil \n\ncolloids. pH together with CEC are very important for prediction of soil sorption capacity \n\n(Barbosa, 1999). \n\nPorosity was determined by two similar procedures: in a simple process by saturating dry soil \n\nsamples (cf. Figure 12) and from the saturated volume during soil-column experiments. The \n\nfirst process consisted in weighting three dry soil samples (and cups), adding water to the \n\nsample top and weight again. This simply allowed of the determination of the volume that was \n\nretained in pores, which corresponds to the porosity. \n\n \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Simple experiment for density determination  \n\nSoil porosity was also determined in these experiments using the following equation: \n\n? =  ??/ ?? ? ??? (%) \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nwhere Vw is the volume of water in the soil sample (cm\n3) \n\nVt is the total volume of the sample (cm\n3) \n\n \n\nSoil bulk density (?b) (g/cm\n3) was determined by the following equation: \n\n??  =  ??/?? \n \n\nwhere Wd is the weight of the dried soil sample (g). \n\n \n\n4.2. Soil-column experiments methodologies and methods \n\nA soil-column is characterized as a discrete block of soil inserted in a column that is located \n\neither outdoors or in a laboratory, allowing the control and measurement of the infiltration, as \n\nwell as incorporating equipment for the total recovery of the effluent. This is usually achieved \n\nby encasing the soil column in a rigid and impermeable shell material, both for structural \n\nreasons and to prevent fluid loss (Lewis and Sj\u00f6strom, 2010). \n\nA set of soil-column experiments were conducted using both natural soil and soil mixture. The \n\nfollowing sections describe the methodologies and results achieved. \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Apparatus description \n\nThe soil-column experimental apparatus consists of an acrylic transparent column with 30 cm \n\nheight and 5 cm diameter (Figure 13) and/or an acrylic column with 50 cm height with a similar \n\ndiameter, which allowed the existence of a controlled height of water on the top of the soil, \n\nsimulating the conditions of real scale infiltration basins. 30 cm column was only used in initial \n\nsoil-column experiments. Following DEMEAU (2015), this material is rigid to ensure structural \n\nstrength, inert to avoid chemical interference (this is particularly important when analysing \n\nemergent contaminants), transparent to facilitate visual observations of events, impermeable, \n\nand resistant to corrosion. \n\nThe soil-column is attached to a compaction system composed of a standardized weight disk \n\nfor soil compaction and a ruler for dropping height determination. All columns have a tight lid \n\nbase with an outlet port which is connected to a sample tube where the outflow water is \n\ncollected. An inert Teflon membrane filter is added to the soil-column bottom for fine particles \n\nretention. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Soil-column experimental apparatus designed and built at LNEC \n\n \n\nFor continuous water injection, a volumetric peristaltic pump was used. This peristaltic pump \n\nhas a pulse volume of 3 mL and time between pulses can be adjusted. Minimum time (1s) \n\nresults in a non-stop pulse making injection continuous. For pulse injection, the water was \n\ndirectly poured from a container to the column (Figure 14). \n\n \n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Soil-column apparatus and diagram of operation \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nThe injection from the wastewater/deionized water reservoir to the pump and from the pump \n\nto the column was made by PE tubes. When in contact with wastewater the tube was not used \n\nin any other experiments to avoid sample contamination. This is very important considering \n\nthat pharmaceuticals occur in very small concentrations (nanograms per litre). The use of \n\nsilicone tubes was discarded to avoid compound loss by reaction to tubing sections. \n\nOutflow samples were collected at defined periods in glass graded tubes. These samples can \n\nbe conditioned in dark glass vials or bottles and keep in the fridge (<4\u00baC) for future analysis \n\nor ultimately destroyed (if the purpose is to only characterize hydraulic behaviour of the soil). \n\nWater naturally flows from the bottom outlet to the sample tubes. \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Soil and wastewater sampling procedure and experiment preparation \n\n4.2.2.1. Soil-column preparation \n\nSoil samples were collected at the approximate location of the infiltration site in the outskirts \n\nof SB Messines wastewater treatment plant, removing the most superficial layer, and \n\ncollecting soil from a depth of 5 to 20 cm. The soil was dried at 40\u00b0C, the large organic matter \n\n(roots, leaves, etc.) was manually removed; afterwards it was quartered and split in equal \n\nportions to be representative of the site soil. \n\nThe soil-column experiments were performed in a soil subject to a dry pack procedure. The \n\nobjective of packing is to produce a homogeneous soil column having a bulk density similar to \n\nthat observed naturally, while avoiding the formation of preferential flow pathways. This might \n\nbe the most critical issue associated with soil-column experiments (Lewis and Sj\u00f6strom, 2010), \n\nsince these preferential flow paths will result in spatial heterogeneity in flux and solutes \n\ntransport, and will significantly bias any experimental results. \n\nDry or damp packing involves loading small discrete amounts or \u201clifts\u201d of dry or damp soil into \n\nthe column and then mechanically packing it either by hand or with some type of ram or pestle \n\n(Lewis and Sj\u00f6strom, 2010). After the column assembling and the Teflon filter correctly \n\npositioned at the bottom end section, the soil-column was filled with the soil following the \n\nCEN/Technical Specification 14405 (2004): fill the column in 5 cm soil sections packing each \n\nsection with the weight, dropping it three times over a 20 cm height above it. In this process \n\nthe whole surface should be covered with the weight disk after three drops for maximum \n\nregularization. The surface was then scarified before addition of another 5 cm layer. The \n\nprocess was repeated until the column was completely filled. The soil-column was then \n\nweighted. This compaction method was applied to all soil-columns except Column 5, where \n\nthe number of weight drops was reduced to two instead of three. \n\nAs stated above, the removal of roots, leaves and big sized organic will help, after compaction, \n\nto decrease the probability of macropore flow to occur. This phenomenon refers to any \n\npreferential flow due to heterogeneities within the porous medium, including cracks, root holes, \n\nwormholes and macropores. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n4.2.2.2. Wastewater sampling \n\nWastewater effluent samples were collected in the SBM WWTP point of discharge. In-situ \n\nparameters were measured and samples for analysis were collected in 1L dark glass bottles \n\nfor pharmaceuticals and 40 mL dark glass vials for other parameters analysis. For injection in \n\nsoil-column experiments, different campaigns for collecting the necessary water were \n\nconducted. This water was collected and transported to LASUB in a large 25L container, \n\nwhere it was fractioned in several smaller glass containers. \n\nAs stated before, both samples collected from SBM WWTP effluent and from the columns \n\nbottom outlet are stored in chilled environment to prevent alteration (<4\u00b0C) until analysis. ECs \n\nare potentially sensitive to UV radiation, so dark glass bottles were used to prevent photo \n\ndegradation, particularly for pharmaceuticals analysis (DEMEAU, 2015). \n\nThe outflow samples were collected once the volume necessary for analysis was achieved, \n\nexcept for pharmaceuticals. Due to the large volume necessary (which corresponded to \n\nseveral pore-volumes to every column) and the time needed to achieve it, the samples \n\ncollected for pharmaceuticals where kept in totalizer bottles. This means that the \n\npharmaceuticals samples were related to an extended period of time, being this the main \n\nreason for the smaller number of samples for pharmaceuticals compared to the other \n\nparameters. The totalizer bottles were also kept in refrigerated conditions. \n\n \n\n4.2.2.3. Natural soil used \n\nTo correctly define the soil parameters and to recreate/model different functioning conditions, \n\nseveral soil-column experiments were conducted using the same natural soil subject to altered \n\nmethods of packing, water matrix, soil thickness and granulometry, time of experiment, \n\ninjection and saturation conditions. Table 8 presents a synthesis of the operating details of the \n\nsoil-column experiments conducted in the natural soil. Uncertainty factors are also taken into \n\naccount and are briefly discussed in Section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 8 - Synthesis of the operating details of the soil-column experiments conducted in the natural soil \n\n Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4 Column 5 \n\nColumn height \n(cm) \n\n30 30 30 50 50 \n\nSoil thickness \n(cm) \n\n30 30 20 30 30 \n\nSieved \n(> 2 mm) \n\nNo Yes Yes Yes Yes \n\nSoil packing \nSpecific \n\nweight - 3 \nstrikes \n\nSpecific \nweight - 3 \n\nstrikes \n\nSpecific \nweight - 3 \n\nstrikes \n\nSpecific weight \n- 3 strikes \n\nSpecific weight \n- 2 strikes \n\n\n\n38 \n\n Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4 Column 5 \n\n \nSaturation \nconditions \n\nStarted \nsaturated \nAlways \n\nsaturated \n\nStarted \nsaturated \nAlways \n\nsaturated \n\nStarted \nsaturated \nAlways \n\nsaturated \n\nStarted \nsaturated \n\nUnsaturated/ \nsaturated \n\ncycles \n\nStarted \nsaturated \n\nUnsaturated/ \nsaturated \n\ncycles \n\nInjection \nmethod \n\nContinuous Continuous Continuous \nContinuous/ \n\npulse \nPulse \n\nInert sand \nlayer on soil \n\ntop \nNo No No Yes (0.5 cm) Yes (0.5 cm) \n\nWater matrix Deionized Deionized \nDeionized/ \nWastewater \n\nWastewater \nDeionized/ \n\nWastewater \n\nExperiment \ntime length \n\n(days) \n1 0.2 5 33 16 \n\nOutflow \nchemical \nanalysis \n\nNo No Yes Yes Yes \n\n \n\nIn total, five soil-column experiments were conducted using natural soil, named Column 1 to \n\nColumn 5. In all experiments the soil used had the same volume, corresponding to 30 cm \n\nheight and 5 cm diameter, except for Column 3 where the height was 20 cm. \n\nFor Column 2 to 4 the soil, which has the tendency to form clay aggregates, was disaggregated \n\nin a mortar and then sieved, having the particles larger than 2 mm being excluded from the \n\ncolumn filling sample \u2013 as stated in Section 4.3.1.1, 84.1% of SBM soil particles are below 2 \n\nmm size. Accordingly to Hillel (1998), large rocks in soil do not behave like soil, and if \n\nnumerous large rocks occur this might affect the behaviour of soil. For such high composition \n\nin sand in SBM soil, being the most representative fraction, it\u2019s advisable to take larger \n\nfractions (gravel). This also allowed for the reduction of possible air pockets (that could result \n\nin preferential flow paths) with better particle rearrangement inside the column. \n\n \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Clay aggregates in natural soil at SB Messines \n\n\n\n39 \n\nIn the top section of Columns 4 and 5 a non-reactive permeable layer was used to ensure an \n\nequal distribution of the input water and minimum disturbance of the first layer of soil during \n\nthe water injection, also preventing an early clogging process. This layer was composed of \n\nFontainebleu quartz white sand with an approximate thickness of 0.5 cm. \n\nFor all five soil-column experiments the soil was completely saturated with deionized water \n\nfrom bottom to top for about 16 hours allowing the reduction of air-pockets inside the soil \u2013 \n\nFigure 16. This saturation process can mainly prevent fingering phenomena, which refers to \n\nthe preferential flow taking place as a result of the wetting front instability, and by a number of \n\nreasons, includes changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth and compression of air ahead \n\nof the wetting front. Fingering is most likely to occur in soils that are predominantly sandy and \n\nthat are initially extremely dry (DEMEAU, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16 \u2013 Saturation process from the column bottom (Column 1) \n\nConcerning the injection method for the experiment, after saturation, all columns except \n\nColumn 5 have started with continuous flow from the top using an automatic peristaltic pump. \n\nColumn 4 experiments started with continuous flow until the end of the first day, and the \n\ninjection method was switched to pulse injection. Column 5 started with pulse injection of \n\napproximately 378 mL of deionized water, filling the 20 cm top of the column,  \n\nColumn 1 and 2 have used deionized water for all experiment time length while the other \n\ncolumns added SBM WWTP effluent water injected. Column 3 experiment, started with \n\ncontinuous deionized water injection and it was switched to wastewater after 30 minutes. In \n\ncolumn 4 only wastewater was used, while column 5 add 2 cycles of deionized water between \n\n2 wastewater injection cycles. \n\nFollowing DEMEAU (2015), the transparent parts of the setup were wrapped in aluminium foil \n\nto simulate non-light conditions encountered in the subsurface, and to reduce photolithotrophic \n\nmicroorganisms growth of and photodegradation of contaminants - Figure 17. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nFigure 17 \u2013 Transparent parts of the column covered with tinfoil paper \n\n \n\nThe experiments were held in different time periods, from a few hours (Column 2) to several \n\ndays (Column 3, 4 and 5). For Columns 4 and 5 an unsaturation period was considered after \n\nevery injection period in order to recreate the field conditions for contaminant degradation \n\nenhancement through oxygenation process. The different experiments aimed to assess the \n\nimportance that compaction procedures, saturation-desaturation and infiltration water quality \n\ncan have in the flow rate of the same soil, also for different time periods. \n\n \n\n4.2.2.4. Soil mixture used \n\nConsidering the interesting results of project ENSAT (Section 2.5) that used a reactive layer \n\ninstalled in the bottom of the SAT-MAR infiltration basin, as well as the results obtained from \n\nthe soil-column experiments using the natural soil, it was decided that a similar approach could \n\nbe taken into account in Portugal MARSOL DEMO site of Queren\u00e7a-Silves. Following Section \n\n1.3 objectives, a reactive layer was created by the mixture of different materials. The quality \n\nof the outflow water and hydraulic behaviour of both the natural soil and the soil mixture were \n\ncompared and will be taken into account in the selection of the best material to be used in the \n\ninfiltration basins. \n\nConcerning the materials to be used, several options were considered. The main factors for \n\nthe selection were essentially that those materials were cheap and easily available (if possible, \n\nwastes resulting from agricultural, recycling or industrial processes), that do not represent risks \n\nfor the environment, and that can be easily handled during the construction process. It was \n\ntaken into account that the materials should be collected near or from the area of the \n\ninstallation, which would greatly reduce the transportation cost. \n\n\n\n41 \n\nAfter a brief literature review and a set of personal contacts, the list of possible materials was \n\nwidened. Several initially considered were later excluded for several factors. An example of \n\nthese materials is cork, carob (\u201calfarroba\u201d) and almond external bark. Cork showed itself a not \n\nso good material for contaminant retention given its hydrophobic and impermeable behaviour, \n\nas presented by Pintor et al. (2012). Also due to its density cork particles tend to fluctuate \n\nmaking it very hard to install in the bottom of infiltration basins. Finally, this material is not \n\ncheap. \n\nCarob is easily available on Algarve. Unfortunately the carob external skin also shown signs \n\nof hydrophobic behaviour as well as it tend to rapidly rot and moulder when in continuous \n\ncontact with water, which would greatly decrease the lifespan of the reactive layer. Also due \n\nto its constitution benefits to human health, carob has seen a price increase, being increasingly \n\nused in flour/food production besides other industrial and agricultural uses. \n\nAlmond external bark, which may have been a good material for mixture with the soil, was not \n\ntested since it did not comply with the factors stated above: this material is neither cheap nor \n\neasily available in the study area, mainly because, due to its calorific power it is commonly \n\nused in industrial ovens or households heating systems. Secondly, although almond trees are \n\nvery common in Algarve, the business of almond has seen a decrease in value due to the \n\nmore accessible prices in emergent markets. Because of this, almond trees are being replaced \n\nby orange trees and other more valuable cultures in the last years. \n\nOther options had to be taken into account. Following ENSAT (2012) method and considering \n\nthat upper soil layers with the higher organic matter content have the potential to accumulate \n\nsome pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine during flooding/drainage cycles (Arye et al., \n\n2011), an organic soil was selected. A commercial organic soil was acquired for the \n\nexperiments. Special attention was taken to its composition as the most common use of \n\ncommercial organic soil is plants fertilization. The acquired organic soil has an organic matter \n\npercentage above 70% and it\u2019s composed by 70% humus resulting from natural composting \n\nand 25% peat. The remaining percentage is fine sand. Given that peat tends to present high \n\nporosities (Walczak et al., 2002) better performance is to be expected in soil oxygenation. \n\nIn fact, a large percentage of organic matter can greatly contribute to the increase of biological \n\nactivity and therefore the chances of biodegradation processes to occur as it has a supply of \n\ndissolved organic carbon. \n\nAnother factor that had to be taken into account was the hydraulic behaviour \u2013 although time \n\nof contact is essential for contaminant retention, it is also important that this reactive layer \n\ndoes not behave as a cap layer. This would result in very long periods of ponding which would \n\npossibly create other problems in the area of infiltration. \n\nTo increase the soil mixture permeability an \u201cartificial sand\u201d was selected. Basically, this \n\ncomponent results from the industrial extraction of inert materials for construction, more \n\nspecifically limestone, common in Algarve. This \u201cartificial sand\u201d results from the crushing of \n\nlimestone into specified particle sizes for different uses. It\u2019s easily available in the study area. \n\nThe selected particle size, available to sell, was 0-2 mm. \n\nIn a soil mixture this material will help to increase the sand fraction and also the porosity, \n\nallowing for infiltration and also for the reactive layer to \u201cbreathe\u201d in the unsaturated periods. \n\n\n\n42 \n\nThe fact that this artificial sand is composed of crushed limestone can have another benefit, \n\nmainly in the quality improvement aspect. Crushing allowed for a larger reactive surface to be \n\navailable in each grain which facilitates surface retention and cationic exchange processes. \n\nAlso, as limestone can present large concentrations of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), \n\ncationic exchange and retention processes can be enhanced by the substitution in rock matrix \n\nof Ca and Mg. Ca and Mg displacement as a result of cation exchange processes can result \n\nin fixation of other elements such as heavy metals (Barbosa, 1999). \n\n \n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Different soil mixture components (artificial sand \u2013 left cup; natural soil (disaggregated and \nsieved) \u2013 middle cup; organic soil \u2013 right cup) \n\n \n\nThe mixing process was relatively simple: taking into account the material percentage to be \n\nconsidered in each mixture, each fraction was weighted in the defined proportions and added. \n\nThis bulk compound was then hand mixed for the sample to be the most homogeneous as \n\npossible. The mixture was then packed into the column following the procedure explained at \n\nSection 4.2.2.3. \n\nThe choice of having a soil mixture of different materials instead of having layers of each \n\nselected material inserted into the column, aims to decrease uncertainty factors related to \n\nwater flow inside the column: the creation of different layers inside can create hydraulic \n\nbarriers with different behaviour that can hinder the water flow, and create preferential ways \n\nor even ponding or retention in certain parts of the column. The homogeneous soil mixture \n\nalong the column avoids changes in flow behaviour from top to bottom, making it as regular \n\nas possible, which is easier to reproduce and numerically model. The soil mixture as a whole \n\ncan insure that the behaviour along the column concerning quality factors is also the same. It \n\nis also very difficult to reproduce this layering process at the basin scale. \n\nTo firstly understand the hydraulic behaviour of the soil mixture, several soil-column \n\nexperiments with different materials percentages in composition were conducted, as \n\ndemonstrated in Figure 19 \u2013 Column 6 to Column 7. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Soil composition in conducted soil-column experiments \n\n \n\nColumn 6 had a composition of 60% of natural soil and 40% of organic soil while Column 7 \n\nhad 40% of natural soil, 30% of organic soil and 30% of artificial sand. These two soil-column \n\nexperiments were conducted at the same time, and allowed to understand the effect of artificial \n\nsand presence in the hydraulic behaviour. \n\nIn Column 8 and Column 9, both with same soil mixture composition, a smaller percentage in \n\nweight of vegetal compound was used. The causes for the change in composition are \n\ndiscussed in Section 4.3.2.2. \n\nQuality parameters where only measured in these two last columns, after measuring that a \n\ngood hydraulic behaviour has been achieved. The purpose of this remains with the fact that \n\nlarge quantities of volume is needed for pharmaceuticals analysis (approximately 1 L) \u2013 having \n\ntwo columns with same soil composition working in parallel, assembled with equal packing \n\nand injection methods, volumes and water matrix, can be understood as being the same \n\ncolumn. So, Column 9 outflow water was collected exclusively for pharmaceuticals analysis \n\nwhile Column 8 outflow water was used to analyse all the other parameters. \n\nThe details concerning the four soil-column experiments conducted in different soil mixtures \n\nare summarized in Table 9. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nTable 9 - Synthesis of the operating details of the soil-column experiments conducted in the soil mixture \n\n Column 6 Column 7 Column 8 Column 9 \n\nColumn height \n(cm) \n\n50 50 50 50 \n\nSoil thickness \n(cm) \n\n30 30 30 30 \n\nSieved \n(> 2 mm) \n\nYes Yes Yes Yes \n\nSoil packing \nSpecific weight \n\n- 3 strikes \nSpecific weight \n\n- 3 strikes \nSpecific weight - \n\n3 strikes \nSpecific weight - \n\n3 strikes \n\nSaturation \nconditions \n\nStarted \nsaturated \nAlways \n\nsaturated \n\nStarted \nsaturated \nAlways \n\nsaturated \n\nStarted saturated \nUnsaturated/satu\n\nrated cycles \n\nStarted saturated \nUnsaturated/satu\n\nrated cycles \n\nInjection method Continuous Continuous Pulse Pulse \n\nInert sand layer \non soil top \n\nYes (0,5 cm) Yes (0,5 cm) Yes (0,5 cm) Yes (0,5 cm) \n\nWater matrix \nDeionized \n\nwater \nDeionized \n\nwater \nWastewater Wastewater \n\nExperiment time \nlength (days) \n\n4 4 46 46 \n\nOutflow chemical \nanalisys \n\nNo No Yes Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Parameters selected for quality analysis \n\nConsidering that wastewater matrix can be very different for each WWTP (given certain factors \n\nsuch number of population served, age of population, seasonal effects, etc.) the parameters \n\nto be analysed in the soil-column inflow and outflow had to be handpicked specifically. \n\nIn-situ parameters such as pH, Eh, temperature and electrical conductivity were measured in \n\nwastewater prior to each injection pulse (Column 4 to Column 5) and during the experiments \n\nin each sample collected in the column outflow. \n\nConsidering the parameters for chemical analysis, three \u201ctracers\u201d that commonly occur in \n\nwastewater where selected due it its stability in aqueous media \u2013 boron, copper and zinc, and \n\nto their presence in the groundwater downgradient the SBM WWTP rejection point (Leit\u00e3o et \n\nal., 2014). \n\n\n\n45 \n\nAnother component which is fundamental, not only to characterize the wastewater matrix but \n\nalso to understand the processes that occur inside the column and the success of soil as \n\nfiltering layer is nitrogen. Nitrogen cycle offers good information about the conditions inside \n\nthe column. Therefore, nitrates, nitrites and ammonia were determined. Also, phosphorous is \n\nan important component in this type of water, so phosphates were considered in the analysis. \n\nComplementary information was also collected on sulphates. \n\nConcerning the pharmaceuticals, and given the knowledge achieved in Section 2.5, special \n\nattention was given to those that are prevalent in wastewater effluent, such as bezafibrate, \n\ncarbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen and propranolol. The characteristics of \n\nthese compounds are presented in Table 10. All pharmaceuticals examined are presented in \n\nthe following results sections (4.3.1.3). \n\n \n\nTable 10 \u2013 Summary of most relevant analysed pharmaceuticals (adapted from www.drugbank.ca) \n\nPharmaceutical Therapeutic use Structure \n\nBezafibrate Antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and \ntriglycerides.

Its mode of action is \nnot fully understood. \n\n \nDiclofenac A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) \n\nwith antipyretic and analgesic actions. \n\n \nGemfibrozil A lipid-regulating agent that lowers elevated serum \n\nlipids primarily by decreasing serum triglycerides \nwith a variable reduction in total cholesterol. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nPharmaceutical Therapeutic use Structure \n\nNaproxen Anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic and \nantipyretic properties.

This way the maximum quantity \n\ninformation would be collected, and processes inside the column could be understood.

Soil characteristics \n\nIn this section the results are presented accordingly to the methods that were explained in \n\nSection 4.1. \n\nGranulometry analysis allowed to determine that SBM natural soil is mainly composed of sand \n\n(81.91%) with a small fraction of silt (15.95%) and clay (2.14%). The granulometric curve is \n\npresented in Graph 5. Representing these results in the textural triangle, this soil is classified \n\nas a Loamy Sand. \n\nThis data will be fundamental in numerical modelling (Section 5). \n\n \n\nGraph 5 \u2013 Granulometric curve for SBM natural soil \n\n \n\nFigure 20 \u2013 Textural triangle (adapted from Hillel, 1998) \n\nCation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and soil solution pH results are presented in Table 14. \n\n\n\n50 \n\nTable 14 \u2013 Natural soil CEC and pH results (d \u2013 Bascomb method) \n\npH CEC d (cmol/kg of soil) \n\n8.90 5.74 \n\n \n\nThe SBM natural soil presents a typical loamy sand CEC value (between 5 and 10 cmol/kg of \n\nsoil2) and high alkalinity. High alkalinity (or alkali) soils may result from high concentrations of \n\nCaCO3 resulting from limestone weathering, which is expected in this area given that the most \n\ncommon lithology is limestone (see Section 3). These soils are often incipient and present low \n\npermeability3. \n\nConcerning mineral composition, the sample of SBM natural soil presented the following \n\nresults (Figure 21): \n\n? Minerals in greater proportion \u2013 quartz, calcite, montmorillonite (bentonite) and \n\nfeldspar (anorthite). \n\n? Minerals in trace proportion \u2013 dolomite, mica (illite), kaolinite and hematite. \n\n \n\nFigure 21 \u2013 SBM soil difractogram to normal (9/2015/2) and below 0.063 mm (9/2015/2 \u2013 FF).

It also presents a low organic matter percentage (2.66%), \n\nwhich was expected given the low CEC value. \n\nBulk density and porosity, determined by the two methods presented in Section 4.1, are \n\npresented in Table 15 and Table 16. Table 15 also presents humidity percentage in soil. \n\nTable 15 \u2013 Porosity and bulk density results \n\n \nSample \n\n1 \nSample \n\n2 \nSample \n\n3 \n\nHumidity (%) 17.98 17.26 16.20 \n\nPorosity (%) 41.29 39.24 38.50 \n\nBulk density \n(g/cm3) \n\n1.09 1.12 1.13 \n\n \n\nTable 16 \u2013 Porosity and bulk density from soil-column experiments \n\n  \nColumn \n\n1 \nColumn \n\n2 \nColumn \n\n3 \nColumn \n\n4 \nColumn \n\n5 \n\nPorosity (%) 45.9 43.1 44.1 43.4 41.8 \n\nBulk density (g/cm3) 1.39 1.38 1.44 1.52 1.46 \n\n \n\nSBM soil presents a slightly high percentage of retained water in its composition (17.15%). \n\nThis may be related with silt/clay fraction. \n\nConcerning porosity, the soil presents a relatively large porosity percentage, typical of sands4. \n\nObtained values are similar in both methods, but slightly higher in soil-column experiments \n\n(average \u2013 43.6%) (average of simple method \u2013 39.7%). \n\nAverage bulk density determined from simple method is 1.11 g/cm3 while slightly higher values \n\nare again observed in the soil-column experiments (average of 1.44 g/cm3). This difference \n\nmay be associated with packing method that is applied only to soil-column experiments. In \n\nsimple method the soil samples were only poured to the container without any packing \n\nmethod, therefore the lower bulk density. Besides these disparities between methods, these \n\nvalues are acceptable for fine loamy sand (Domenico and Schwartz, 1998; Lewis and \n\nSj\u00f6strom, 2010) \u2013 Table 17. \n\nTable 17 \u2013 Average range of bulk densities and porosities of typical unconsolidated soils (adapted from \nDomenico and Schwartz, 1998) \n\nType of soils Porosity range (%) Bulk density range (g/cm3) \n\nCoarse gravel 24 - 36 2.0 - 1 .7 \n\nFine gravel 25 - 38 2.0 - 1.6 \n\nCoarse sand 31 - 46 1.8 - 1.4 \n\nFine Sand 26 - 53 2.0 - 1.2 \n\nSilt 34 - 61 1.7 - 1.0 \n\nClay 34 - 60 1.7 - 1.0 \n\n                                                \n4 http://web.ead.anl.gov/resrad/datacoll/porosity.htm  \n\nhttp://web.ead.anl.gov/resrad/datacoll/porosity.htm\n\n\n52 \n\n4.3.1.2. Soil hydraulic behaviour \n\nSoil hydraulic behaviour was analysed taking into account the column outlet flow rates, and \n\nconsequently permeability, for all soil-column experiments conducted using SBM natural soil. \n\nThe main results are summarized in Table 18. Flow rate and permeability results are \n\npresented as average for two periods of time \u2013 average obtained at first day of experiment \n\n(Day 1 line) and average obtained for all the experiment time length (Experiment time line). \n\nTable 18 \u2013 Natural soil-column experiments results for flow \n\n  \nColumn \n\n1 \nColumn \n\n2 \nColumn \n\n3 \nColumn \n\n4 \nColumn \n\n5 \n\nPore-volume (mL) 270.1 253.5 173.2 266.1 256.3 \n\nExperiment time length (days) 1 0.11 4.26 32.99 15.92 \n\nFlow rate (cm3/min) \nDay 1 0.846 - 0.869 0.363 1.504 \n\nExperiment \ntime \n\n0.846 1.457 0.789 0.174 0.543 \n\nPermeability (m/d) \nDay 1 1.353 - 1.445 0.589 2.536 \n\nExperiment \ntime \n\n1.353 2.480 1.312 0.282 0.915 \n\n \n\nConcerning the calculated pore-volume for each column, similar values were obtained for each \n\ncolumn (considering that the pore-volume for column 3, with 20 cm, is 173.2 mL \u00d7 3/2 is 259.8 \n\nmL) \u2013 for a 30 cm soil layer in a 5 cm diameter column an average pore-volume of 261.16 mL. \n\nThe slightly above average pore-volume obtained for Column 1 experiment may result from \n\nthe fact that the soil was not sieved nor disaggregated, which created a large number of \n\ncavities due to the large granulometric heterogeneity (Figure 22). \n\n \n\nFigure 22 \u2013 Detail of Column 1 (unsaturated) \n\n \n\nAs previously stated, column experiments were conducted through different time periods, from \n\nseveral hours (Column 2) to 1 month (Column 4). This allowed the observation of the flow rate \n\nvariation though time in different levels of detail. \n\nHaving as reference the column behaviour for 1 day, it\u2019s possible to observe several variations \n\nthroughout the five columns (Table 18). Column 4 presents the worst result at the end of this \n\nperiod in terms of flow rate (0.363 cm3/min) and permeability (0.589 m/d). On the other hand, \n\nColumn 5 presented the best results, with a flow rate and permeability four times larger than \n\n\n\n53 \n\nin Column 4. It can be assumed that these discrepancies are a direct result from the \n\nassembling and packing methods as described in Section 4.2.1, Table 8, given that Column 5 \n\npacking only took 2 strikes instead of 3 in Column 4 and the first cycles used deionized water \n\n(= lower biological and organic content therefore lower possibility for clogging) instead of \n\nwastewater. \n\nIf a linear behaviour is considered by observing this parameters for all the time of the \n\nexperiment is possible to see that it tends to decrease through time \u2013 Flow rate of experiment \n\nat C1 (0.846 cm3/min), C2 (1.457 cm3/min) and C3 (0.789 cm3/min) where the longest is C3 \n\nand the shortest is C2. \n\nThe evolution of flow rate through time in the five soil-column experiments is presented in \n\ndetail for 1.4 days in Graph 6, and for the whole time length of the experiment and pore-volume \n\nin Graph 7 and Graph 8, respectively. \n\nFlow rate tends to naturally decrease over time, mainly in the first 2.4 to 4.8 hours (0.1 to 0.2 \n\ndays). After this period, the flow rate continues to decrease but not so fast. It is also observed \n\nthat flow rate and velocity keep decreasing over time at slightly lower rates. The lower flow \n\nrates were observed for column 4 (0.04 cm3/min) at the end of 4th cycle of \n\nsaturation/unsaturation, and completely clogged at the end of 33 day of functioning. However, \n\nat every injection pulse, the flow rate temporarily increases, due to the increase of the water \n\nhydraulic gradient above the soil top. This is most noticeable in Column 5, that runs for 16 \n\ndays with 9 saturation/unsaturation cycles (due to its higher permeability), but the last \n\nmeasured flow rates were 0.006 cm3/min, before experiment was stopped. \n\nPonding above soil top was also longer as permeability decreased and time between cycles \n\nincreased. \n\n \n\nGraph 6 \u2013 Natural soil hydraulic behaviour (Time vs Flow rate) \u2013 1.4 days \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nGraph 7 \u2013 Natural soil hydraulic behaviour (Time vs Flow rate) \u2013 35 days \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nGraph 8 - Natural soil hydraulic behaviour (Pore-volume vs Flow rate) \n\n\n\n56 \n\nConsidering pore-volume units (Graph 8) it is possible to observe that flow rate decreases \n\nnoticeably at 1 to 2 pore-volumes (0.5 in Column 4), and tend to achieve the lowest values at \n\n14 pore-volumes (equivalent to approximately 3500 mL) (11 pore-volumes in Column 4). \n\nAs stated previously, clogging processes occurred inside the columns. The large organic and \n\nbiological load of wastewater will result in the formation of biofilms on the top of the column \n\nand in biological activity will be more important inside the column itself - Figure 23. Although \n\nthe main consequence is a decrease of soil permeability, it can be a positive aspect in \n\nbiodegrading some contaminants. \n\n \n\nFigure 23 \u2013 Biofilm with equal daily cycle in infiltrating water above soil top (Column 4) (left) and \nbiological activity inside the soil column (Column 5) (right) \n\n \n\nThese clogging processes, which are uniquely distributed along the column can create a \n\nblockage to water flow at the top section of the column while the bottom section (which has a \n\nfree flow outlet) continuously desaturates. This can result in different environments inside the \n\ncolumn, with lower oxygen on the top and higher on the bottom. \n\n \n\n4.3.1.3. Inflow/outflow results comparison \n\nSoil-column experiment inflow and outflow samples for the SBM natural soil are synthetized \n\nin this section. The results were divided into subsections given the type of parameter \n\nconsidered \u2013 metals, nitrogen cycle components, major ions and pharmaceuticals. Other \n\nparameters that were measured in the outflow in LASUB such as pH, Eh and electrical \n\nconductivity are also presented. \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n4.3.1.3.1. Metals \n\nMetals and metalloids inflow and outflow concentration are presented in Graph 9 to Graph 14 \n\nfor all three columns (C3, C4 and C5). Considering the large difference in terms of magnitude \n\nbetween these and phosphorous and manganese, they are presented in separate graphs \u2013 \n\nColumn 3 (Graph 10), Column 4 (Graph 12) and Column 5 (Graph 14). It\u2019s important to refer \n\nthat other metals were analysed but only those with values above LOR are presented. \n\n \n\nGraph 9 \u2013 Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 3 \n\n \n\nConcerning the first set of metals for Column 3 (aluminium, barium, boron, copper, iron, \n\nmolybdenum, nickel, vanadium and zinc), inflow water (IN) shows that boron and barium are \n\npresent in the higher concentration. In the first outflow sample (S1), copper, aluminium, iron, \n\nbarium and boron show concentrations above those measured in inflow water (IN). This is \n\nprobably the result of the osmosis and desorption processes resulting from the contact \n\nbetween the soil and the distilled water used for the initial saturation. Besides barium and \n\nboron, which are present in higher concentrations throughout all the experiment, all remaining \n\nelements show the soil high capacity to retain them for the period of the experiment, \n\nconsidering that they are continuously being fed in the input WW. Assuming that no significant \n\nreactions occurred in inflow water since the time of sample in SBM WWTP until time of \n\ninjection, the presence of B and Ba may be the result of continuous soil washing out, showing \n\nthat barium and boron are very conservative under the existing conditions and maybe also a \n\npart of the soil chemical composition itself (since values are higher than the inflow water). This \n\nis consistent with the presence of B and Ba measured in the groundwater downgradient the \n\nWWTP discharge (cf. Leit\u00e3o et al., 2014). \n\n\n\n58 \n\nAlloway (1990) referred, from experiments with zinc and iron (two other metals present in the \n\ninflow water), in a clay soil with organic matter at different pH values, that these metals are \n\nmore strongly adsorbed to alkaline soils. Given the characteristics of the soil and its \n\ncomposition in bentonite, illite and kaolinite, zinc reduction at outflow can be explained by \n\nadsorption at the exchange sites or entrapment in clay lattice. \n\nPhosphorous and manganese are other two elements present in the Column 3 inflow water \n\n(IN), the first in higher concentration (approximately 5 mg/L) (Graph 10). The first sample (S1) \n\nshows that both elements have lower concentration than the inflow, but a trend of increasing \n\nin concentration detected on the following samples, although the measured maximum values \n\nin outflow are approximately 1/9 of initial concentration for phosphorous. Manganese outflow \n\nvalues are higher than inflow after S9 with increasing trend, corresponding to the soil \n\nsaturation after approximately 10 pore-volumes. \n\n \n\nGraph 10 \u2013 Manganese and phosphorus inflow/outflow concentration in Column 3 \n\n \n\nColumn 4 metals (excluding phosphorous and manganese) in inflow water (IN) show, similarly \n\nto C3, that boron, barium and iron are common in this water matrix. All outflow samples show \n\nhigher concentrations for these elements, except iron. At outflow boron presents almost 3 \n\ntimes the inflow concentration while barium has 10 times the inflow concentration, both with \n\nincreasing trends until outflow sample 2 and oscillating behaviour after that. Aluminium and \n\nmolybdenum (which has a below LOR value at inflow) show higher concentration in the first \n\noutflow sample but the values remain more or less stable throughout the experiment.  \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nGraph 11 \u2013 Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 4 \n\n \n\nGraph 12 \u2013 Manganese and phosphorus inflow/outflow concentration in Column 4 \n\nConcerning manganese and phosphorus, the behaviour is very similar to Column 3. \n\nPhosphorus outflow concentration is much smaller than inflow and shows an oscillating \n\nbehaviour, while manganese shows lower outflow concentration at the first until sample five \n\nand from there a trend to increasing concentration, higher than inflow due to soil saturation. \n\n\n\n60 \n\nColumn 5 inflow water present similar results than Column 4, being boron, barium and iron \n\nthe noticeable concentrations. Outflow samples also present higher concentrations for boron \n\nand barium, although the second element shows a decrease between Sample 1 and \n\nSample 2. Besides this, the number of samples does not allow for establishing a trend. Nickel \n\nshows higher concentration in both outflow samples when compared to inflow. Molybdenum \n\nis not presented as none of the samples (both inflow and outflow) are above LOR. \n\n \n\nGraph 13 \u2013 Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 5 \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nGraph 14 \u2013 Manganese and phosphorus inflow/outflow concentration in Column 5 \n\nColumn 5 outflow results for manganese and phosphorous again show similar behaviour to \n\nColumn 4, as phosphorous decreases in outflow and manganese presents higher outflow \n\nconcentration when compared with inflow. Soil washing out may be the cause for this \n\nbehaviour. \n\nGiven the inflow water matrix (wastewater), a particular attention was given to three metals \n\nthat may be considered tracers and common \u2013 boron, copper and zinc. Concentration \n\nvariations along the experiment for these elements are presented in terms of natural soil pore-\n\nvolume units in Graph 15 to Graph 17. \n\nBoron conservative behaviour is observed in detail, particularly in Column 3 where \n\nconcentration at outflow remains very stable along al the experiment (although oscillating), \n\nand approximately the same as inflow (Graph 15). Column 4 and Column 5 both present \n\nhigher concentrations of boron at outflow, but similar values. Saturation and non-saturation \n\nconditions show no effect on B concentration. \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nGraph 15 - Boron vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nCopper is show similar behaviour between Column 3 and Column 4 (Graph 16), with an \n\nincrease of concentration at outflow between the first and second pore-volume and a steady \n\ndecrease after that, suggesting a soil washing out process for this element, which origin is due \n\nto the soil composition and not to the WW. Column 5 number of samples does not allow for \n\nany complex conclusions other than that in pore-volume (PV) 9 and PV14 copper \n\nconcentrations is still at higher concentrations than the inflow. The slow decrease in \n\nconcentration at outflow can be explained by the fact that Cu is specifically adsorbed by soil \n\nat relatively slow rates (Alloway, 1990), being the retention process very ineffective on the first \n\nstages of the experiments. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nGraph 16 \u2013 Copper vs Pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nFinally zinc show an oscillating behaviour along C3 experiment with values always below \n\ninjection concentration. Column 4 shows an irregular behaviour, with zinc concentration \n\nincreasing irregularly after experiment start and PV2-3 and an outflow concentration below \n\ninflow at PV3. Again C5 results only allow establishing that at PV 9 and PV14 values of zinc \n\nare below inflow concentration in similar behaviour to C3 results. \n\n \n\nGraph 17 \u2013 Zinc vs Pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n\n\n64 \n\n4.3.1.3.2. Nitrogen cycle \n\nThe results of ammonia, nitrites and nitrates concentrations are presented for Column 3, \n\nColumn 4 and Column 5 in Graph 18, Graph 19 and Graph 20, respectively. \n\n \n\nGraph 18 \u2013 Nitrogen cycle components concentration in Column 3 inflow/outflow \n\n \n\nColumn 3 outflow results show an increase in ammonia concentration (although smaller than \n\ninflow concentration) along the time the experiment was conducted, while nitrites show an \n\nincrease on S1 and S2 and a continuous decrease in the next samples. Nitrates also show a \n\nhigher concentration at S1 when compared to inflow (IN) but the concentration decreases in \n\nS2 and S3 until below LOR. In this case, a degradation of ammonia into nitrites and nitrates \n\nseem to have occurred in the column, although the total nitrogen at inflow is higher than the \n\nmeasured nitrogen at outflow. \n\nThe trend of increasing ammonia in the outflow may have resulted from the fact that \n\ncontinuous injection on Column 3 did not allowed for the column to achieve an aerobic \n\nenvironment, resulting in the formation or non-degradation of injected ammonia. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nGraph 19 \u2013 Nitrogen cycle components concentration in Column 4 inflow/outflow \n\n \n\nColumn 4 inflow sample show similar composition to Column 3, as ammonia is the \n\npredominant compound in the nitrogen cycle. Nitrites and nitrates are in this inflow sample \n\nbelow LOR. After experiment start it\u2019s noticeable that ammonia has a very small concentration \n\nat OUT sample 1 when compared to inflow, but shows in the following outflow samples a trend \n\nfor increase. Concerning nitrites, although concentration at outflow is higher than inflow \n\nbetween outflow samples 1 to 3 with an increasing trend, in outflow sample 4 and the next the \n\nvalues highly decrease (from 18.6 mg/L in sample 3 to 0.0413 mg/L in sample 4). A similar \n\nbehaviour is verified for nitrates concentration, with a peak at outflow sample 2 followed by a \n\nsteep decrease until values below LOR (OUT sample 4 and next). This may mark a change \n\nin the column environment. \n\nAgain, the slight increase of ammonia along the experiment may represent that each cycle is \n\nless successful in oxygenating the column. This may be due to clogging processes inside the \n\ncolumn that keep the column always saturated even with oxygenation (no injection) periods. \n\nAlso, as permeability decreases, the ponding time above the soil column is longer (see Section \n\n4.3.1.2) not allowing for the column to \u201cbreath\u201d, creating conditions for a redox environment. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nGraph 20 \u2013 Nitrogen cycle components concentration in Column 5 inflow/outflow \n\n \n\nFinally, column 5 inflow show similar composition to Column 4, and an increase in nitrites in \n\nthe following 2 samples collected from the outflow. Nitrates remained below LOR while \n\nammonia showed again a decrease in concentration when compared to inflow. \n\nVisualizing the behaviour of these tree elements along the experiment in terms of pore-volume \n\nmay be helpful to understand it. Ammonia, nitrites and nitrates are presented in Graph 21, \n\nGraph 22 and Graph 23, respectively. \n\nConcerning ammonia, Column 3 presents a steady concentration below inflow until \n\napproximately PV9 where it starts to gradually increase. Similar behaviour is presented in \n\nColumn 4, although there is only data until PV3. Values at outflow are very similar between \n\nthe 3 soil-column experiments. \n\nAs stated above, nitrites behave similarly in Column 3 and Column 4 with an increase between \n\nPV1 and PV2 and a stable concentration parallel to inflow. Column 5 shows nitrite \n\nconcentration higher than C3 and C4 at PV9 and PV14. \n\nNitrates only show values above LOR between PV1 and PV2 in both Column 3 and Column 4. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nGraph 21 \u2013 Ammonia vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\n \n\nGraph 22 \u2013 Nitrites vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nGraph 23 \u2013 Nitrates vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nFrom the analysis of the results of the three columns, it is possible to see that ammonia (NH4\n+) \n\nis being nitrified in the first pore-volume periods, when nitrites (NO2\n?) and nitrates (NO3\n\n?) were \n\nincreased: \n\n2 NH4\n+ + 3 O2 ? 2 NO2\n\n? + 2 H2O + 4 H\n+ \n\n2 NO2\n? + O2 ? 2 NO3\n\n? \n\nThis denitrification process was possible throughout the all period of Column 4 and 5 \n\nexperiments due to the saturation-desaturation sequence imposed. However, Column 3 was \n\nsaturated all the time; therefore, the absence of O2 did not allow denitrification in the last \n\nstages (PV) which resulted in the presence of more NH4\n+. These results show the importance \n\nof saturation-desaturation cycles in the N cycle degradation. \n\n \n\n4.3.1.3.3. Major ions \n\nResults from major ions for Column 3, Column 4 and Column 5 are presented in Graph 24, \n\nGraph 25 and Graph 26, respectively. Due to the large required volume, bicarbonate was not \n\nanalysed. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nGraph 24 \u2013 Column 3 major ions inflow/outflow concentrations \n\n \n\nColumn 3 results concerning major ions allow establishing that inflow water shows that \n\nchloride is the only parameter not detected, and sulphate is very abundant followed by sodium \n\nand calcium. Sulphate shows lower concentrations at outflow when compared to inflow, while \n\nsodium (although similar) show a clear increase trend and surpasses inflow concentration \n\noutflow after sample 9 (S9). \n\nCalcium is the most abundant ion at outflow with concentration that is 3 times higher than \n\ninflow (S3). After a trend of concentration decrease seems to be established, allowing to \n\nassume that this element common in soil concentration is being continuously washed out. \n\nMagnesium shows equal behaviour although with lower concentrations, as well as potassium, \n\nwith some peaks in S4 and S6 and steady behaviour after that. \n\nChloride behaviour suggest that some problem occurred in the detection of this ion taking into \n\naccount that concentration goes from 0 mg/L in every sample to 97.9 mg/L in only one sample \n\n(S6). \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nGraph 25 \u2013 Column 4 major ions inflow/outflow concentrations \n\n \n\nColumn 4 inflow water shows large concentrations of calcium, chloride, magnesium, \n\npotassium, sodium and sulphate above 10 mg/L. Similarly to Column 3, calcium and \n\nmagnesium show values above inflow concentration at the outflow. Sulphate shows a clear \n\nincreasing trend to achieve inflow values at outflow sample 7. Similarly sodium shows an \n\nincrease in concentration throughout the experiment, while potassium remains more or less \n\nsteady after outflow sample 2, suggesting that this element washing out occurred at this point. \n\nFinally chloride behaviour seems to be similar to calcium and magnesium, and clearly differ \n\nwith Column 3s inflow/outflow concentrations. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nGraph 26 \u2013 Column 5 major ions inflow/outflow concentrations \n\n \n\nColumn 5 shows an increase in sulphate, calcium, magnesium, sodium and chloride, with \n\nconcentrations values above inflow. Phosphate shows very low concentrations in comparison, \n\nand potassium seems to be slowly decreasing in concentration throughout the experiment. \n\nAgain, continuous washing out of magnesium and calcium is apparently occurring while \n\nchloride seems to have a persistent behaviour. \n\n \n\n4.3.1.3.4. Pharmaceuticals \n\nThe final set of parameters analysed is pharmaceuticals. Although a set of 24 of these \n\ncompounds were analysed (60 parameters in the case of Column 3), special attention was \n\ngiven to those that were detected in outflow, and are commonly referred in bibliographic \n\nreferences as being persistent. \n\nIt\u2019s important to refer that pharmaceuticals at inflow where only analysed for Column 4 and \n\nColumn 5, while in Column 3 only one outflow sample for these compounds was analysed. \n\nConcerning Column 3, outflow analysis of 60 different compounds showed that \n\ncarbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide, ibuprofen, levetiracetam, \n\nnaproxen and primidone are the only above LOR. From these levetiracetam showed the \n\nhighest concentration (2.1 \u00b5g/L) and primidone the lowest (0.02 \u00b5g/L). \n\nFor Column 4 and Column 5 inflow water pharmaceuticals concentrations please refer to Table \n\n13 in Section 4.2.3. \n\n\n\n72 \n\nFor the 24 compounds considered in outflow water for Column 4 (1 sample), bezafibrate, \n\ncarbamazepine diclofenac, gemfibrozil and naproxen showed concentrations above LOR, with \n\nthe highest being naproxen (0.46 \u00b5g/L) and the lowest in carbamazepine (0.02 \u00b5g/L). \n\nIn Column 5, two samples were taken that showed similar results: bezafibrate, \n\ncarbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen. Column 5 sample 1 \n\ncompound with lowest concentration is carbamazepine (0.02 \u00b5g/L) and the highest is \n\nnaproxen (0.76 \u00b5g/L). In sample two, naproxen shows again the highest concentration \n\n(0.61 \u00b5g/L) and ibuprofen the lowest (0.17 \u00b5g/L) \n\nPore-volume progression throughout the experiments is presented for carbamazepine, \n\ndiclofenac, gemfibrozil and naproxen are presented in Graph 27 to Graph 30. \n\n \n\nGraph 27 \u2013 Carbamazepine vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nCarbamazepine, although with an increasing trend in column 5 shows a lower concentration \n\nthan inflow in all outflow samples for all columns. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nGraph 28 \u2013 Diclofenac vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nDiclofenac shows similar behaviour as carbamazepine although in Column 5 measured \n\noutflow concentrations seem to be converging with inflow concentrations. \n\n \n\nGraph 29 \u2013 Gemfibrozil vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nFor Column 4 and 5, gemfibrozil was detected in the outflow analysis with higher concentration \n\nthan inflow. Assuming that no pharmaceuticals are present at the soil, as it is at its natural \n\n\n\n74 \n\nstate, and that no form of contamination could be possible, this could result from problems \n\nwith sampling or conditioned retention and washing out when column conditions change. This \n\nwill be discussed in depth in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nGraph 30 \u2013 Naproxen vs Pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nSimilar behaviour as gemfibrozil was detected in Column 5, with higher outflow concentration \n\nwhen compared with inflow. Column 4 presents a coherent behaviour. Although not presented \n\ngraphically, ibuprofen outflow concentration values are also higher than inflow. \n\n \n\n4.3.1.3.5. pH, Eh and electrical conductivity \n\nOnce a minimum volume for measurement (approximately 15 mL) was collected, pH, redox \n\npotential (Eh) and electrical conductivity were recorded. Eh was not measured in Column 3 \n\ndue to a problem in the sensor. pH, Eh and electrical conductivity are presented in Graph 31, \n\nGraph 32 and Graph 33, respectively. \n\nConsidering as reference the pH values of Column 3 inflow water (Table 12), which \n\ncorrespond to a slightly acid water (6.08), outflow shows higher values (approximately 7), \n\nexcept in PV10 where it has basic pH (approximately 9.5). Column 4 and Column 5 have a \n\npH of 7.61 at inflow but, with the exception of some samples (in PV0-1 PV6-7 and PV7-8 for \n\nColumn 4), outflow water for both columns is neutral to basic. In terms of general behaviour \n\nalthough values are very disperse between 6.5 to 9.5 interval, there are no noticeable trends \n\nor any variations due to infiltration cycle start. The high pH levels contribute to the retention of \n\nmost heavy metals in soils (cf. section 4.3.1.3.1) due to the complexes formed with the \n\ncarbonates and oxides and hydroxides. \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\nGraph 31 - pH vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nRedox potential analysis (Graph 32) may be the key to understanding the behaviour of certain \n\nelements as the redox environment inside the column will facilitate other reactions that can \n\nresult in degradation/sorption of contaminants. \n\n \n\nGraph 32 \u2013 Redox potential vs Pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nTable 12 presents the Eh inflow values for Column 4 and Column 5 (173 mV). \n\n\n\n76 \n\nFor both Column 4 and Column 5 redox potential values taken at outflow show anaerobic \n\nconditions in several occasions, with most of Eh &lt;40 mV. Column 4 shows a gradual decrease \n\ntrend in Eh from positive (?40 mV) to negative values. In Column 5, Eh values remain in the \n\nsame interval as Column 4 both the lower boundary of interval has higher values. This \n\ndifference may reflect the success of the saturation/unsaturation cycles in oxygenating the \n\ncolumns, in lower degree in Column 4 that has lower conductivity (see Section 4.3.1.2). In \n\nmost situations it is possible to observe an increase in the Eh after saturation starts.  \n\nFinally, electrical conductivity values (Graph 33) at inflow (760 \u00b5S/cm for C3 and 649 \u00b5S/cm \n\nfor C4 and C5) are generally lower than those observed at outflow with the exception of \n\nColumn 5. At the start of soil-column experiment 3 and 4 it\u2019s noticeable an increase of electrical \n\nconductivity in outflow that goes to PV1 in C4 and to PV2 in C3. Mixing between deionized \n\nwater and wastewater is clear at this interval. Considering that wastewater injection in C5 \n\nstarted after 2 cycles of deionized water, the same as C3 and C4 behaviour is observed but \n\nonly at PV3. \n\n \n\nGraph 33 \u2013 Electrical conductivity vs pore-volume (natural soil) \n\n \n\nThe continuous washing out process (possibly of Ca and Mg) is observed clearly in Column \n\n4, as electrical conductivity values remain stable after PV1 with only small fluctuation. Similar \n\nbehaviour is show in Column 3 with electrical conductivity stabilizing between 800 and \n\n900 \u00b5S/cm along the experiment after PV2. \n\nSoil in column 5, after PV3 seems to respond to the deionized water/wastewater mixing \n\nprocess. After that, there is a rapid response to wastewater inflow is observed (PV6-7) at \n\nsaturation cycle start and a following stabilization of behaviour with small fluctuation at each \n\nnew cycle. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n4.3.1.4. Soil analysis \n\nAt the end of the experiment conducted in Column 3 and Column 5, each column was \n\ndismantled and soil samples were collected and sent to analysis in an external laboratory. The \n\nparameters analysed considered not only pharmaceuticals but also some metals, and nitrogen \n\ncycle components. Both columns were split into two equal sections (15 cm each), \n\ncorresponding to top and bottom. A set of pharmaceutical compounds were analysed for both \n\ncolumns. For these compounds only one composite sample of the soil was considered for \n\nColumn 3 while for Column 5 two samples were analysed (more precisely, one for the top \n\nsection and one for the bottom section). \n\nThe main results for Column 3 and Column 5 (excluding pharmaceuticals) are presented in \n\nTable 19 and Table 20, respectively.  \n\nTable 19 \u2013 Column 3 soil analysis results \n\nParameter Unit LOR \nSample 1 \n\n(top section) \nSection 2 \n\n(bottom section) \n\nBoron mg/kg DW 1.0 13.4 15.4 \n\nCopper mg/kg DW 1.0 32.2 33.3 \n\nZinc mg/kg DW 3.0 30.4 31.2 \n\nAmmonia mg/kg DW 0.50 60.3 19.8 \n\nNitrates mg/kg DW 20 &lt;20 &lt;20 \n\nNitrites mg/kg DW 0.050 0.248 0.238 \n\nPhosphorus % DW 0.050 0.267 0.235 \n\nPhosphates % DW 0.10 0.61 0.54 \n\nSulphate % DW 0.10 0.12 &lt;0.10 \n\nNote: DW \u2013 dry weight \n\n \n\nThe data presented for Column 3 show an almost equal concentration of boron, copper and \n\nzinc in top and bottom section, but boron concentrations are clearly lower (although inflow \n\nSBM WWTP effluent has higher concentrations in B, cf. Table 12). This confirms the ability of \n\nnatural soils to retain the Cu and Zn that is continuously fed during the experiment (3 pore-\n\nvolumes) and the conservative behaviour observed for B that is not retained but leached. Cu \n\nand Zn concentrations in soils show a similar value to the average sedimentary soils of the \n\nworld (30 mg/kg) (Alloway, 1990). \n\nConcerning the nitrogen cycle, ammonia showed much higher concentrations when compared \n\nwith nitrates and nitrites. Nitrates where not detected in both top or bottom section and nitrites \n\nshow very small concentration when compared to ammonia in both sections. This seems to \n\njustify the large decrease difference between inflow and outflow concentrations verified in all \n\ncolumns, showing that ammonia is heavily retained on the soil top section, besides being \n\ntransformed into nitrites and nitrates. This last one is conservative, being leached by the \n\noutflow water.  \n\nPhosphorous and phosphates show higher concentrations in the soil top section but both in \n\nsmall concentrations. This complies with what was verified in outflow water, with relatively \n\nimportant phosphorous concentrations. Sulphate concentration was not detected at bottom \n\nsection, and on top it was slightly above LOR. \n\n\n\n78 \n\nFrom the set of selected pharmaceuticals, none showed concentrations above LOR. Extended \n\nColumn 3 soil analysis results are presented in Appendix 3. \n\nBoron and copper in Column 5 (Table 20) showed similar concentrations, although slightly \n\nlower, to those detected in Column 3. This is relevant since Column 5 had 15 PV of WW \n\npassing through the soil, and the retention capacity for Cu was maintained. Zinc appears to \n\nhave been concentrated on the bottom section of the column, possibly due to higher \n\nsaturation. \n\nTable 20 \u2013 Column 5 soil analysis results \n\nParameter Unit LOR \nSample 1 \n\n(top section) \nSection 2 \n\n(bottom section) \n\nBoron mg/kg DW 1.0 11.8 9.2 \n\nCopper mg/kg DW 1.0 30.1 34.3 \n\nZinc mg/kg DW 3.0 27.4 48 \n\nAmmonia mg/kg DW 0.50 71.2 17.6 \n\nNitrates mg/kg DW 20 140 25 \n\nNitrites mg/kg DW 0.050 184 7.98 \n\nPhosphorus % DW 0.050 0.124 0.105 \n\nPhosphates % DW 0.10 0.28 0.24 \n\nSulphate % DW 0.10 &lt;0.1 &lt;0.1 \n\nNote: DW \u2013 dry weight \n\n \n\nAmmonia shows a high concentration on the top section and about 1/4 of that on the bottom \n\nsection. Nitrates and nitrites were also detected with the same behaviour \u2013 higher \n\nconcentration on column top. When comparing both compounds to low concentrations \n\ndetected in the outflow water it can be assumed that they were retained in the column. Also, \n\nby comparing nitrites to nitrates it\u2019s possible to see a higher concentration of nitrites on the top \n\nof the column and higher concentration of nitrates on the bottom. It can be assumed that the \n\ntop section of Column 5 is more oxygenated than the bottom section, generating the \n\ndegradation of ammonia on the top, then to nitrites and finally to nitrates at the bottom, where \n\nthey were retained. While in Column 3 most ammonia was transformed into nitrites and \n\nnitrates that were leached in the outflow (not accumulating in the soils), Column 5 is a longer \n\nexperiment (15 PV instead of 3 PV) leading to the accumulation of nitrites and nitrates in the \n\ntop part of the soil column. \n\nAgain phosphorous and phosphates show lower concentrations in both sections when \n\ncompared to Column 3, but in the same magnitude. \n\nSimilarly to Column 3 sulphates where not detected in bottom section, as well as on the top. \n\nConcerning pharmaceuticals, the only value above LOR detected was in caffeine, in higher \n\nconcentration on top section (57 mg/kg). Extended Column 5 soil analysis results are \n\npresented in Appendix 4. \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n4.3.2. Soil mixture \n\nThe results obtained in the experiments performed with natural soil (Section 4.3.1) showed \n\nthe need to increase soil ability to retain some elements, namely pharmaceuticals, at the same \n\ntime that the permeability, and therefore the infiltration rate, would be maintained or even \n\nincreased. Based on these purposes, different mixtures of soils were defined and tested \n\naiming to define the \u201cperfect soil\u201d for the future application in the SAT-MAR basins. These \n\nmixtures are composed of different proportions of: natural soil, organic soil, and sand (cf. \n\nFigure 19).  \n\nIn the following sections the results concerning soil mixture characteristics (Section 4.3.2.1), \n\nhydraulic behaviour (Section 4.3.2.2) and quality aspects of outflow water (Section 4.3.2.3) \n\nare presented. \n\n \n\n4.3.2.1. Soil characteristics \n\nFor natural soil component descriptions please refer to Section 4.3.1.1. \n\nThe carbonates percentage determined for the organic soil was 21%. Carbonates percentage \n\nwas also determined for artificial sand. As expected 99% of this soil mixture component is \n\ncarbonates, as it results from crushed limestone (see Section 4.2.2.4). The increase of \n\ncarbonates may result in contaminant retaining processes. \n\nOrganic matter was not determined since the artificial sand is expected to have a null organic \n\nmatter percentage due to its source (it\u2019s not a soil itself) and the second component should \n\nhave a organic matter percentage > 70% as stated by the seller. \n\nA granulometric analysis for soil mixture was not possible due to the large organic content that \n\nwould be severely altered by washing out and high temperature drying. For the same reason \n\nthe organic soil was not submitted to this characterization. On the other hand, artificial sand \n\nwas subjected to granulometric characterization \u2013 Graph 34 \n\n \n\nGraph 34 \u2013 Artificial sand granulometric curve \n\nAs expected, 98.1% of the particles are of the size of sands and 1.49% are below 0.063 mm. \n\n\n\n80 \n\nSoil mixture bulk density and porosity where determined after column assembling and results \n\nare presented in Table 21. \n\nTable 21 \u2013 Soil mixture porosity and bulk density \n\n  \nColumn \n\n6 \nColumn \n\n7 \nColumn \n\n8 \nColumn \n\n9 \n\nPorosity (%) 45.0 53.1 74.8 69.8 \n\nBulk density (g/cm3) 1.09 0.93 1.23 1.19 \n\n \n\nPorosity values seem to be related to the percentage of artificial sand added to the soil mixture \n\n\u2013 Column 6 (60% natural, 40% organic) had the lower porosity value while Column 8 &amp; Column \n\n9 (40% natural, 20% organic, 40% artificial) had the higher porosity values. Column 7 \n\npresented the lower bulk density, although being similar to Column 6. \n\nBoth parameters are dependent not only in soil texture but also on the column packing. Since \n\neach soil mixture presented has its own characteristics, defining which factors will result in \n\nparameters variation is not possible. A larger set of soil mixtures with different percentages of \n\ncomponents would be necessary to understand which effects they cause in soil characteristics \n\nand soil behaviour. \n\nAlthough Column 8 and Column 9 have the same composition they show different porosity \n\nand bulk density. This may be related to column assembling factors and is discussed in \n\nSection 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.3.2.2. Soil hydraulic behaviour \n\nSoil-column experiments were conducted with different soil mixtures, namely to understand \n\nthe short and long term effects in hydraulic behaviour. The results are summarized in Table \n\n22. \n\nTable 22 \u2013 Soil mixture column experiments results for flow \n\n  \nColumn \n\n6 \nColumn \n\n7 \nColumn \n\n8 \nColumn \n\n9 \n\nExperiment time length (days) 4.0 4.0 46 46 \n\nPore-volume (mL) 265.2 312.4 440.2 411.1 \n\nFlow rate (cm3/min) \nDay 1 7.722 2.572 3.340 4.341 \n\nExperiment \ntime \n\n4.931 1.789 0.792 1.272 \n\nPermeability (m/d) \nDay 1 12.579 3.557 3.278 4.562 \n\nExperiment \ntime \n\n8.032 2.474 0.777 1.337 \n\n \n\nComparing pore-volume values, it noticeable that a decrease of the organic soil percentage \n\nand increase of artificial sand percentage in the mixture results in pore-volume increase. \n\nAgain, as described previously, Column 8 and Column 9 show different pore-volumes, \n\nalthough the soil composition is exactly the same. These differences are also visible when \n\ncomparing C8 and C9 flow rate and permeability. Both experiments were conducted with the \n\n\n\n81 \n\nsame type of inflow water matrix, thickness and assembling method, but C9 shows higher flow \n\nrates and permeability, which is almost the double that was verified in C8. Besides that factor, \n\nboth C8 and C9 show lower permeability than C6 and C7, showing that the decrease of organic \n\nsoil and increase of artificial results in a decrease of permeability. \n\nBoth Graph 35 and Graph 36 show flow-rate changes throughout time and pore-volume \n\nrespectively. For Column 6 and Column 7 a set of peaks were observed (easily observable in \n\nFlow rate vs Pore-volume graph) where there is an increase in flow rate and an abrupt change \n\nwith a decrease of flow rate. Given that water injection was continuous and no alteration of \n\ninjection flow was made, these peaks may result from soil washout and/or particle \n\nrearrangement that, after a period of decreasing permeability, result in lower flow rates with \n\nponding above soil column. This hydraulic pressure resulting from ponding may have forced \n\na preferential flow path (potentiated by soil wash out) and consequent particle rearrangement, \n\ntherefore an increase in flow rates until stabilization. \n\nColumn 8 and Column 9 show fast response after each saturation period start and low ponding \n\ntime as the flow rate rapidly increases. It\u2019s noticeable that C9 has almost double flow rates \n\nand consequently higher permeability, but shows very similar decrease times to C8 \n\n(approximately 1 day). Both columns show a smooth linear decrease of flow rates through \n\ntime but a more steep decrease within the first pore-volume. \n\nOne of the facts that resulted in aborting soil-column experiment C6 and C7 was the \n\ncontinuous soil washout that created large macropores (and water/air pockets) - Figure 24. In \n\nColumn 8 and Column 9 this washout processes was observed in the first 2 cycles, noticeable \n\nin the colour of the outflow water (which was slightly yellow), but no growing cavities were \n\nvisible in the column walls. \n\n \n\nFigure 24 \u2013 Detail of soil washing out process (Column 6) \n\n \n\nAlso, and possibly resulting from fine particle washout and rearrangement, a visible \n\ncompaction process was observed in all columns but more noticeable in Column 6 and \n\nColumn 7. While in Column 8 the maximum compaction observed was 1.5 cm, in Column 6 it \n\nachieved 3 cm. These processes showed a weak soil mixture structure and may have resulted \n\nin not good filtering layer as it was being continuously washed out. \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nGraph 35 - Soil mixture hydraulic behaviour (time vs flow rate) \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nGraph 36 - Soil mixture hydraulic behaviour (time vs pore-volume) \n\n\n\n84 \n\n4.3.2.3. Inflow/outflow results comparison \n\nThe inflow and outflow samples collected in the soil-column experiments for the soil mixture \n\nare summarized in the following sections. Following the same procedure used for natural soil \n\nexperiments, results were divided into subsections given the type of parameter considered \u2013 \n\nmetals, nitrogen cycle components, major ions, and pharmaceuticals. \n\nAs stated previously, pharmaceuticals were only measured at Column 9 outflow, while the \n\nother parameters where determined for Column 8, assuming same conditions in the columns. \n\nColumn 6 and 7 were only used for flow assessment, so no water or soil quality analysis was \n\nperformed. \n\nOutflow pH, Eh and electrical conductivity where measured in LASUB in both Column 8 and \n\nColumn 9. \n\n \n\n4.3.2.3.1. Metals \n\nMetals and metalloids concentrations in inflow and outflow water are presented in Graph 37 \n\nand Graph 38. Due to the differences in magnitude between the concentration values of \n\nphosphorous and manganese, they were presented in a separate graph. \n\nFrom the set of parameters presented in Graph 37, arsenic, chromium and copper show the \n\nlowest concentrations at inflow, while aluminium, antimony, iron, barium and boron show the \n\nhighest values. Barium and boron show the highest concentrations of this set at outflow, and \n\nafter outflow sample 13 (S13) there is a trend of decrease, with some oscillations. \n\nAlso after S13 iron concentration increases, and several samples after that show values above \n\ninflow concentration. This point may mark an alteration in the column conditions or the soil \n\nsaturation in this element. At this point the pH values show a temporary decrease (between \n\npore-volume 4 and 8 (cf. Graph 52), possibly responsible for the temporary release of some \n\nmetals). S13 was the last sample to be collected before the experiment was stopped for one \n\nweek. This longer unsaturation period, were injection stopped (and outflow flux was severely \n\nslowed as the soil mixture constituents, such as peat trend to have a great water retention \n\ncapacity) may have resulted in a longer time of water soil interaction and better oxygenation. \n\nThe potentiation of the reactions by the longer interaction may have resulted in lower pH in \n\nsoil solution and processes of desorption processes in metals, that were ultimately mobilized \n\nwhen inflow was resumed one week later (and therefore higher concentrations in metals were \n\nmeasured). \n\nAntimony show concentrations similar to inflow from sample S1 to S4 and then decreases and \n\nstabilizes its concentration along the experiment. \n\nOn the second set of metals (Graph 38), outflow samples show regular behaviour throughout \n\nthe all experiment, having approximate inflow/outflow values, except for molybdenum, \n\nselenium, thallium and lithium. Those are higher in the first outflows, possibly as a result of \n\nthe soil composition. The first metal has its concentration increasing between S2 and S3 \n\nsuggesting a washout process, similarly to selenium and thallium. Lithium shows an increase \n\nof concentration between S2 and S18 and converges to values below inflow after that. The \n\ntemporary increase of lithium between S13 and S18 possibly has the same reason, resulting \n\nfrom the pH decrease. \n\n\n\n85 \n\nFinally, phosphorous shows at inflow relatively high concentrations, and assumes as \n\noscillatory behaviour at outflow, with concentrations that can be approximately half of inflow. \n\nManganese show also oscillatory behaviour with a possible washout process between S1 and \n\nS7 and S11 to S29 with concentrations always above inflow. \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nGraph 37 \u2013 Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 8 (1st set) \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nGraph 38 \u2013 Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 8 (2nd set) \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nGraph 39 \u2013 Manganese and phosphorus inflow/outflow concentration in Column 8 \n\n\n\n89 \n\nAnalysing in detail some of the metals, Graph 40, Graph 41 and Graph 42 present boron, \n\ncopper and zinc concentrations at the outflow. \n\n \n\nGraph 40 \u2013 Boron vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\nBoron shows its conservative behaviour between experiment start and PV3-PV4. After that \n\nboron concentrations measured are always below inflow concentration with a tenuous \n\nincrease trend from PV10. Assuming that the inflow concentration remains the same it can be \n\nassumed that a retention mechanism is causing a smaller concentration in outflow. Even \n\nthough B is an anion, which is likely to be conservative as Cl- or NO3\n-, B is sorbed more strongly \n\nby soils than other anions and the manner of its sorption by clay surface or organic matter is \n\nsomewhat similar to that of cations, for example as B(OH)4\n?. Being this soil mixture more rich \n\nin organic matter, the better performance in B behaviour is due to that. \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\nGraph 41 \u2013 Copper vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\nA copper washing out process seems to occur between experiment start and PV1, and after \n\nthat the concentration at outflow show a decreasing trend. The only exception is at PV5. These \n\nresults are similar to those obtained in the natural soil-column experiments. \n\n \n\nGraph 42 - Zinc vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\nZinc only show above LOR outflow concentration between experiment start and PV1 \u2013 which \n\nagain seems evidence of soil washout \u2013 and between PV3 and P5. Again the behaviour is \n\nvery similar to that obtained in natural soil experiments, which ability to retain this metal and \n\n\n\n91 \n\nCu was already good. Also the increase of OM in soil percentage could have helped in the \n\nretention of this metal as this component is an important factor affecting behaviour of Zn in \n\nsoil, which results in higher adsorption capabilities (Alloway, 1990). \n\n \n\n4.3.2.3.2. Nitrogen cycle \n\nConcerning the nitrogen cycle Graph 43 summarizes the inflow/outflow results for Column 8. \n\nInflow water present high concentration in ammonia while nitrites and nitrates concentration \n\nare bellow LOR.  \n\nAt the outflow, ammonia decreases in concentration, compared with inflow, while nitrites \n\nreappears between S12 and S23. Nitrates show very high values, several orders of magnitude \n\ncompared to inflow. The maximum value measured is 724 mg/L at outflow sample 3. This high \n\nconcentration may be directly related to the soil mixtures organic component. Considering that \n\nit represents a commercial soil, nitrogen may have been added to its composition, being slowly \n\nreleased during the experiment. Again the changes observed during S13 and S18 may have \n\ncreated conditions that prevented the oxidation of nitrites to nitrates. \n\nAmmonia, nitrites and nitrates concentration along pore-volume are presented in Graph 44, \n\nGraph 45 and Graph 46. \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nGraph 43 - Nitrogen cycle components concentration in Column 8 inflow/outflow \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nGraph 44 - Ammonia vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\nAmmonia outflow values are, as previously stated, always below inflow concentration, with \n\nonly a slight increase between PV4-PV8. This also represents that in several periods the \n\ncolumn is being oxygenated and ammonia is being degraded into nitrites and nitrates. \n\n \n\nGraph 45 - Nitrites vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\nNitrites also show an increase in concentration between PV4 and PV7, that remained until  \n\nPV11. Comparing with ammonia this may represent a period when the conditions inside the \n\ncolumn have changed, allowing for the nitrogen cycle to invert resulting in transformation of \n\n\n\n94 \n\nnitrites and ammonia, by low oxygen levels inside it. Values are always above inflow \n\nconcentrations. \n\n \n\nGraph 46 - Nitrates vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\nAs presented above nitrates detected in outflow can achieve high values in several hundreds \n\nof mg/L. That nitrites concentration seems regular between PV1-PV3 and also between PV12-\n\nPV14. \n\nSuch high concentration of nitrates due to possible soil and organic matter washout end up \n\ndisguising the nitrogen cycle processes inside the column, not allowing to compare nitrates \n\noutflow concentration with nitrites and ammonia with such different orders of magnitude. \n\nThe presence of the organic soil does not favour the outflow concentrations of nitrates and \n\nnitrites, but in the real scale SAT-MAR basin it is expected that nitrate reduction can occur in \n\nreducing environment producing N2 gas, that will escape to the atmosphere:  \n\n2 NO3\n- + 12 H+ + 10 e- -> N2 (g) + 6 H2O \n\n \n\n4.3.2.3.3. Major ions \n\nCalcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium and sulphate concentration \n\nresults are presented in Graph 47. \n\nAgain bicarbonate concentrations were not measured as the necessary volume was too high. \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nGraph 47 \u2013 Column 8 major ions inflow/outflow concentrations \n\n\n\n96 \n\nWhen comparing calcium and magnesium inflow and outflow concentrations, it\u2019s again \n\npossible to observe a continuous soil washing out processe, where high concentrations \n\nalong all samples are detected, except for magnesium that tends to stabilize between \n\nS6 and S11 and S19 and S29. Given that limestone is added to the soil mixture these \n\noutflow concentrations in calcium and magnesium were expected. \n\nSodium and sulphate have also higher concentrations at inflow. Both show great \n\nincrease between S12 and S20. Comparing with other parameters previously presented \n\nfor this column, there seems to be a generalized increase of concentrations between \n\nS12 and S20. Chloride also follows this behaviour. Again almost all of these samples, \n\nmainly after S13, were collected after a long period of desaturation, where the \n\nexperiment was stopped for 1 week. This may have allowed for the good oxygenation of \n\nthe soil, as well as a change in the column conditions, as the sat/unsaturation interval \n\ngreatly increased when compared with the others. \n\nThis may have also resulted from inflow sample composition variation, but this will be \n\nfurther discussed in Section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.3.2.3.4. Pharmaceuticals \n\nA set of 24 pharmaceuticals were analysed at the 4 samples collected at Column 9 \n\noutflow. \n\nIn the inflow water, as presented in Table 13 (Section 4.2.3), 9 out of 24 pharmaceuticals \n\nshowed concentrations above LOR \u2013 atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, \n\nsotalol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen and carbamazepine. \n\nFollowing the methodology presented in Section 4.3.1.3.4, graphics for carbamazepine, \n\ndiclofenac, gemfibrozil and naproxen are presented in Graph 48, Graph 49, Graph 50 \n\nand Graph 51. \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nGraph 48 \u2013 Carbamazepine vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\n \n\nGraph 49 \u2013 Diclofenac vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nGraph 50 \u2013 Gemfibrozil vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\nGraph 51 \u2013 Naproxen vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\nComparing with inflow data, and considering that inflow concentrations remain the same \n\nthroughout the experiment, it\u2019s possible to observe that none of the pharmaceuticals \n\nwere detected at outflow \u2013 concentrations are below LOR. This may have been a result \n\nof soil retention and/or biodegradation. \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n\n4.3.2.3.5. pH, Eh and electrical conductivity \n\nSimilarly to natural soil-column experiments, pH, redox potential (Eh) and electrical \n\nconductivity were measured once the necessary volume at outflow was achieved. \n\nResults for these three parameters, in terms of pore-volumes, are presented in Graph \n\n52 to Graph 54. \n\nColumn 8 and Column 9 show similar behaviour with pH situated between 6 and 8.5, \n\nwith the exception of sample collected at PV5 where pH is approximately 5.5 (with no \n\nnoticeable changes in the condition of the experiment during that period this may be an \n\nerror of measurement). No specific trend is observable and values are not very far from \n\nthe inflow water pH (7.28). This means that no significant alteration is occurring in the \n\nsolution pH inside the column along the experiments, except for the period between PV4 \n\nand PV8, which is the only one with pH &lt;7 after the experiment started (post PV1). That \n\nparticular change has had important consequences in some metals remobilization, with \n\nclear increase in their concentration in the outflow water for that period. \n\n \n\nGraph 52 \u2013 pH vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\nConcerning Eh parameter, a similar behaviour is observed between C8 and C9, with Eh \n\nat outflow lower than inflow (90 mV). Again no specific trend is clear, and a low \n\noxygenated environment is observed. \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nGraph 53 \u2013 Redox potential vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\n \n\nGraph 54 \u2013 Electrical conductivity vs pore-volume (soil mixture) \n\n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nElectrical conductivity doesn\u2019t show a clear trend in both columns considering inflow \n\nvalue (1052 ?S/cm), although from PV9-10 values are below inflow. In column 8 this \n\nparameter increases significantly between experiment start and PV1 and decreases \n\nagain until PV2. This suggests that deionized water/wastewater mixture occurs rapidly \n\nand a soil washout process starts (as electrical conductivity values increase until \n\napproximately 1800 ?S/cm, higher than inflow). After a new saturation cycle there is a \n\nnew increase but not as clear as the previous. Column 9 show no obvious behaviour with \n\nan increase in electrical conductivity in all experiment time, but after PV12-13 appears \n\nto be a clear increasing and continuous trend. \n\n \n\n4.4. Batch experiments \n\nTwo batch experiments were conducted to understand, in equilibrium conditions, what is \n\nthe behaviour of both natural soil and soil mixture concerning maximum contaminant \n\nretention capacity. \n\nAs only one batch experiment was conducted for each soil using collected wastewater, \n\nthis does not permit a more complex analysis with Langmuir isotherm (Langmuir, 1997; \n\nAppelo and Postma, 1996) that needs several batch experiments conducted with \n\ndifferent contaminant concentrations in the inflow. The results will only be scrutinised in \n\nterms of inflow/outflow concentration comparison. \n\n \n\n4.4.1. Apparatus description and methodologies \n\nIn both batch experiments the same procedure has been used. To avoid major \n\nalterations in chemical composition both natural and soil mixture were air dried. Drying \n\nin high temperatures may affect the soil organic matter composition and pH (EPA, 1992). \n\nConcerning the soil mixture, the components described in Section 4.2.2.4 used in \n\nColumn 8 and Column 9, where used in the same proportion in the batch experiment. \n\nThe adsorbent soils were mixed with SBM WWTP effluent in the proportion of 1:5 \n\n(Zakharova and Leit\u00e3o, 2002) \u2013 240 mg of soil to 1200 mg of water each. The volume of \n\nwater used considered the amount of volume necessary both for pharmaceuticals (1000 \n\nmL) and other parameters (approximately 200 mL) - in the batch reactor (glass bottle). \n\nThe reactor lid was closed and the soil solution was shaken manually every hour for 12 \n\nhours during two days and after left without shaking for an additional 48 hours period. \n\nThe batch reactor was kept under controlled temperature and was covered with tinfoil \n\npaper to reduce photolithotrophic microorganisms growth and photodegradation of \n\ncontaminants. After settling the soil solution was filtered through 45 \u00b5m filter by vacuum \n\npressure pumping (Figure 25). Electrical conductivity, Eh and pH effluents values have \n\nbeen measured and samples were sent for analysis in an external laboratory. \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nFigure 25 \u2013 Batch reactor previous to water filtration \n\n \n\nThe adsorbed amount (Qe) of each heavy metal has been calculated accordingly to the \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n?? =\n(?? ? ??) \u00d7 ?\n\n?\n \n\nwhere Qe represents the adsorbed amount (mg/kg), Ci is the concentration before the \n\nexperiment (mg/L) and Ct after the experiment (mg/L), V is the volume of solution (L) and \n\nM is the mass of soil (kg). \n\nPercent of removal (%) was calculated using the equation: \n\n% =\n(?? ? ??)\n\n??\n\u00d7 ??? \n\nThe parameters analysed were the same as described in Section 4.2.3.

Again this increase in the outflow water is a result from \n\nthe interaction between soil and water and explains the increase observed in Graph 47 \n\nuntil S11 (since the increase in concentration after that period have different reasons). \n\nThe capacity to retain Ba is also clearly seen for this soil mixture when compared to the \n\nnatural soil.  \n\n\n\n106 \n\nConcerning pharmaceuticals results are presented in Table 26. \n\nTable 26 \u2013 Soil mixture batch experiment results \u2013 pharmaceuticals (values in red are below LOR) \n\nParameter Unit LOR Inflow Ouflow \nAdsorbed \namount \n(mg/kg) \n\nRemoval \n(%) \n\nAtenolol \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.06&lt;0.01 0.0003 100.0 \n\nBetaxolol \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.01&lt;0.01 0.00005 100.0 \n\nBisoprolol \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.03&lt;0.01 0.00015 100.0 \n\nMetoprolol \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.04&lt;0.01 0.0002 100.0 \n\nPindolol \u00b5g/L 0.01&lt;0.01&lt;0.01 0 - \n\nPropanolol \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.02&lt;0.01 0.0001 100.0 \n\nSotalol \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.05&lt;0.01 0.00025 100.0 \n\nAcetylsalicylic \nAcid \n\n\u00b5g/L 0.02&lt;0.02&lt;0.02 0 - \n\nBezafibrat \u00b5g/L 0.02 0.01&lt;0.01 0.00005 100.0 \n\nClofibrins\u00e4ure \u00b5g/L 0.02&lt;0.02&lt;0.02 0 - \n\nDiclofenac \u00b5g/L 0.02 0.15&lt;0.01 0.00075 100.0 \n\nFenoprofen \u00b5g/L 0.02&lt;0.02&lt;0.02 0 - \n\nGemfibrozil \u00b5g/L 0.02 0.4&lt;0.02 0.002 100.0 \n\nIbuprofen \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.01&lt;0.01 0.00005 100.0 \n\nIndometacin \u00b5g/L 0.02 0.02&lt;0.02 0.0001 100.0 \n\nKetoprofen \u00b5g/L 0.01&lt;0.01&lt;0.01 0 - \n\nNaproxen \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.17&lt;0.01 0.00085 100.0 \n\nCarbamazepin \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.73 0.1 0.00315 86.3 \n\nDiazepam \u00b5g/L 0.01&lt;0.01&lt;0.01 0 - \n\nEtofibrat \u00b5g/L 0.02&lt;0.02&lt;0.02 0 - \n\nFenofibrat \u00b5g/L 0.04&lt;0.04&lt;0.04 0 - \n\nPentoxifyllin \u00b5g/L 0.01 0.01&lt;0.01 0.00005 100.0 \n\nPhenacetin \u00b5g/L 0.01&lt;0.01&lt;0.01 0 - \n\nPhenazon \u00b5g/L 0.01&lt;0.01&lt;0.01 0 - \n\n \n\nFor the selected 24 pharmaceuticals analysed, 14 were above LOR in inflow water and \n\nonly 1 in the outflow water. 100% removal rate was observed in atenolol, betaxolol, \n\nbisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, sotalol, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, \n\nibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen and pentoxifyllin. Carbamazepine showed \n\nrecalcitrant behaviour, but a relatively high removal rate (86.3%). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n107 \n\n5. Numerical modelling of column experiments \nNumerical modelling exercises were conducted using data collected in the soil-column \n\nexperiments. These exercises can be a helpful tool to describe contaminants behaviour \n\nas well as some removal mechanisms and the conditions in which they occur. Solute \n\ntransport and geochemical modelling were considered for the column behaviour \n\nunderstanding. \n\nFor the solute transport modelling Hydrus-1D (Jacques and \u0160im?nek, 2005) was used. \n\nThis software is widely used to simulate flow and solute transport in variably saturated \n\nsoils and groundwater in both steady and transient state. One dimensional flow can be \n\nmodelled at different scales from laboratory soil-columns to larger experiments. Hydrus-\n\n1D can also considerer inverse problems when some parameters need to be calibrated \n\nor estimated from observed data. \n\nFor geochemical modelling PHREEQC 3.1 (Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013) was used. \n\nPHREEQC is a speciation program to calculate the saturation index for numerous \n\nminerals and solid phases, the distribution of aqueous species in equilibrium, as well as \n\nthe density and specific conductance of a specified solution composition. Also adsorption \n\nand desorption can be modelled as surface complexation reactions or as ion exchange \n\nreactions as well as ion exchange. \n\nHP1 (Hydrus-1D coupled with PHREEQC) package was not used, as it was not \n\nfundamental for the modelling process. Compared to HP1, PHREEQC 3.1 interactive \n\nmenus and capabilities allow for easier and faster inclusion of large amounts of data, \n\nwhile the first software requires the user to have deeper knowledge of input language \n\nand data insertion, which is not as intuitive. Also, PHREEQC 3.1 allows for easier output \n\ndata selection and integration with other software like Excel.  \n\nIn these modelling exercises pharmaceuticals where not considered due to the \n\ncomplexity of the modelling processes and the large number of influencing factors. Few \n\nstudies have attempted to model this type of compound breakthroughs curves to \n\ndifferentiate between sorption and biodegradation, as modelling does not take into \n\naccount the main removal mechanisms and considers the results as a whole trying to \n\nrelate some changes with some initial varying conditions (DEMEAU, 2015). \n\n \n\n5.1. Nitrogen cycle / transport modelling \n\n5.1.1. Input data \n\nGiven that nitrogen cycle is highly dependent on redox conditions, modelling the \n\nnitrification process can be useful to understand the conditions inside the column. \n\nFor this modelling process, continuous saturated conditions were considered \u2013 all time \n\nlength of Column 3 experiment (continuous flow) and the first saturation cycle of Column \n\n4. Column 5 was not modelled due to the small number of outflow samples. Column 8 \n\nwas also not considered taking into account that no data was available granulometric \n\npercentages for the soil mixture, which is necessary input data for Hydrus-1D. \n\n\n\n108 \n\nSimulations were run in transient state for solute transport, where the inflow and outflow \n\nconcentrations were considered as solute top and bottom boundary conditions \n\nrespectively. Both models were divided into five time intervals. \n\nInput parameters for both soil-column experiments are presented in Table 27. Some of \n\nthe input parameters were obtained by bibliographic research while others were inverse \n\nmodelled (Ilie, 2015). \n\nTable 27 \u2013 Input data for Hydrus-1D C3 and C4 models. \n\nParameter Column 3 Column 4 Ref.

In Column 3 simulation, ammonia \n\nconcentration rapidly decreases to zero at the first half of the column while in Column 4 \n\nsome ammonia can be observed at the bottom section but in much lower concentration \n\nthan that observed on the top. Nitrites concentrations show a small increase in the first \n\ncentimetres of the column top and decreases again. In Column 4 bottom nitrites are \n\nobserved at the outflow. Nitrates continuously increase in Column 4 while in Column 3 \n\n\n\n110 \n\nthis compound increases at the first \u00bc of the column thickness and slowly decreases \n\nafter that. \n\nFor the considered parameters for the three solutes, solute retention and possibly \n\ntransformation can be observed, which can suggest that good conditions occur at the \n\ncolumns for nitrification, with lower oxygen content on the column top and slight \n\noxygenation on the bottom (where higher concentration of nitrates is observed). \n\nAlthough ammonia retention on the column is confirmed by inflow and outflow \n\ncomparison, particularly in natural soil experiments (C3 to C5), the observed behaviour \n\ncalculated in simulations is not what is observed in the soil-column experiments results, \n\nmainly for nitrates concentrations. In soil-columns, nitrates show low concentration at \n\noutflow, instead of high concentrations calculated in the model. This may result from the \n\ntime of simulation considered, but also, in the soil columns, to a process of retention of \n\nnitrates, observed in the models, where nitrates have high concentrations at the bottom \n\nsection of the column and possibly are not mobilized to the water. \n\nFive nodes were represented along both columns, equally distributed between them. \n\nResults for variation of concentration through time taken from these nodes (from top to \n\nbottom) are presented in Figure 27 and Figure 28. \n\nNodes Column 3 Column 4 \n\n1 \n\n  \n\n2 \n\n  \nFigure 27\u2013 Hydrus-1D results for nitrogen simulation for node 1and 2 (S1 \u2013 ammonia, S2 \u2013 nitrites, \n\nS3 \u2013 nitrates) \n\n \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\nNodes Column 3 Column 4 \n\n3 \n\n  \n\n4 \n\n  \n\n5 \n\n  \nFigure 28\u2013 Hydrus-1D results for nitrogen simulation for nodes 3, 4 and 5 (S1 \u2013 ammonia, S2 \u2013 \n\nnitrites, S3 \u2013 nitrates) \n\n \n\nSolute behaviour is observed in different depths along the columns, through time (from \n\npoint 1 to 5). Again ammonia (S1) concentrations are very low (or null) at the bottom in \n\nboth columns. \n\nIn an overview of the model results, Column 3 achieves stabilization in these compounds \n\nconcentration in the first 1000 minutes and in Column 4 at approximately 200 minutes. If \n\n\n\n112 \n\npore-volumes determined in soil-column experiments are considered and that 1L of \n\nwater is injected in both columns (steady state flow), these periods correspond to 5.7PV \n\nfor C3 and 3.8PV for C4. \n\n \n\n5.2. Saturation index / Hydrogeochemical modelling \n\n5.2.1. Input data \n\nTaking into account the relatively high outflow concentrations of calcium and magnesium, \n\nthe Saturation Index (Log SI) was calculated for calcite and dolomite. Considering that \n\nhematite is one of the natural soil constituents (as presented in Section 4.3.1.1) its Log \n\nSI was also determined. Given that there are no determination of silica, both at outflow \n\nand inflow for all columns, the calculation of Log SI for the other major mineral \n\nconstituents of the natural soil was not possible (quartz, anorthite, montmorillonite, \n\nkaolinite, etc.). \n\nColumn 3, Column 4 and Column 8 inflow and outflow solutions were inserted into \n\nPHREEQC. Column 5 was not considered due to the small number of outflow samples.  \n\nAs HCO3\n- concentration was only measured for Column 8 inflow and outflow, average \n\nconcentration detected at C8 outflow was used as input for Column 3 and Column 4. \n\nInflow concentration of this parameter was also used as input for inflow solution for C3 \n\nand C4 \n\nPHREEQC input data is presented in Appendix 5. \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Results \n\nSaturation indexes determined for dolomite, calcite and hematite for Column 3 inflow \n\nsolution are presented in Table 28. \n\nTable 28 \u2013 Column 3 inflow Log SI for dolomite, calcite and hematite \n\n Dolomite Calcite Hematite \n\nSaturation \nIndex \n(Log) \n\n-3.8967 -1.9426 0.2011 \n\n \n\nThe Log SI calculated shows that Column 3 inflow water is unsaturated in calcite and \n\ndolomite. Very low value (Log SI ? 0) for hematite show that the solution is in equilibrium \n\nwith this mineral. \n\nSaturation index for calcite and dolomite of Column 3 outflow is presented in Graph 55. \n\nHematite saturation index is presented in Graph 56. \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\nGraph 55 \u2013 Column 3 outflow Log SI for calcite and dolomite \n\n \n\n \n\nGraph 56 \u2013 Column 3 outflow Log SI for hematite \n\n \n\nBoth calcite, dolomite and hematite present similar behaviour although Log SI for \n\nhematite is slightly higher. Outflow Log SI shows that solution is saturated in these \n\nminerals until PV7, where unsaturated suggests that conditions inside the column \n\nchanged. At approximately PV10 Log SI for the set of minerals is positive, decreases to \n\nequilibrium state and unsaturated again. \n\nUnsaturation at inflow and saturation at outflow suggests that calcite and dolomite \n\ndissolution is occurring inside the column. Therefore, these results can explain the large \n\nconcentrations of Ca and Mg at the outflow. \n\n\n\n114 \n\nHigh pH measured in solution 11 (near PV10) may have resulted in relatively high Log \n\nSI for hematite, calcite and dolomite. \n\nSaturation indexes determined for dolomite, calcite and hematite for Column 4 inflow \n\nsolution are presented in Table 29. \n\nTable 29 \u2013 Column 4 inflow Log SI for dolomite, calcite and hematite \n\n Dolomite Calcite Hematite \n\nSaturation \nIndex \n(Log) \n\n0.0298 0.0281 14.6752 \n\n \n\nIn this soil-column experiment, inflow solution is close to stability concerning dolomite \n\nand calcite while high Log SI for hematite was determined, showing saturation in this iron \n\noxide. \n\nSaturation index for calcite and dolomite in Column 4 outflow is presented in Graph 57. \n\nHematite saturation index is presented in Graph 58. \n\n \n\nGraph 57 \u2013 Column 4 outflow Log SI for calcite and dolomite \n\n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\nGraph 58 \u2013 Column 4 outflow Log SI for hematite \n\n \n\nAgain, Column 4 Log SI for calcite, dolomite and hematite seem to follow the same \n\nbehaviour. Outflow Log SI for calcite and dolomite is constantly below 0, showing that \n\nthe solution collected at column outlet is unsaturated in these minerals (except of PV2 \n\nwhere Log SI ? 1). On the other hand, hematite Log SI is constantly over 0, showing \n\nsaturation, although Log SI is much lower than Log SI calculated for inflow. This can \n\nsuggest that Column 4 conditions allowed for some precipitation of these minerals, \n\ninstead of dissolution. It\u2019s also important to note that this data is referring to only 3 pore-\n\nvolumes of the experiment. \n\nSaturation indexes determined for dolomite, calcite and hematite for Column 8 soil \n\nmixture inflow solution are presented in Table 30. \n\nTable 30 \u2013 Column 8 inflow Log SI for dolomite, calcite and hematite \n\n Dolomite Calcite Hematite \n\nSaturation \nIndex \n(Log) \n\n-0.4131 -0.2777 11.2803 \n\n \n\nFor this soil-column experiment, inflow solution is slightly unsaturated in calcite and \n\ndolomite. Again hematite Log SI is showing oversaturation at inflow. \n\nSaturation index for calcite and dolomite of Column 8 outflow is presented in Graph 59. \n\nHematite saturation index is presented in Graph 60. \n\n \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\nGraph 59 \u2013 Column 8 outflow Log SI for calcite and dolomite \n\n \n\n \n\nGraph 60 \u2013 Column 8 outflow Log SI for hematite \n\n \n\nColumn 8 outflow Log SI general behaviour shows that, except for a small period after \n\nexperiment start and PV9-11, Log SI for calcite and dolomite is >0. Taking in account \n\nthat inflow was unsaturated in these minerals, dissolution occurred inside the column. \n\nAgain this can explain the high concentrations of Ca and Mg at outflow. Saturation cycles \n\nseem to result in an increase of SI, suggesting that mineral dissolution inside the column \n\n\n\n117 \n\nstarts as soon as spreading starts. Interval between PV9 and PV11 suggest that \n\nconditions inside the column changed as calcite and dolomite are unsaturated. \n\nTemperature values measured for the samples collected between this interval were \n\nrelatively low (<10\u00baC) which could have resulted in low Log SI in speciation modelling. \n\nConcerning hematite, Log SI values calculated for C8 outflow solutions, which are very \n\nsimilar to inflow SI, show once again saturation. It is possible that hematite in the soil \n\nconstitution remains unchanged, and no reactions occur between the soil media and \n\nsolution concerning this mineral. Besides this, there is a difference between inflow and \n\noutflow concentration of iron for the soil mixture experiment (Section 4.3.2.3.1). \n\n \n\n5.3. Inverse modelling \n\n5.3.1. Input data \n\nInverse modelling was used as a way to understand phase transfers that occur between \n\ninflow solution and the soil media. The methodology adopted consisted in inverse \n\nmodelling solution A to solution B, C, D, etc., having as solution A the initial solution \u2013 \n\nthe inflow water \u2013 and the final solutions as the outflow solutions collected from the \n\ncolumn. \n\nFor this exercise, Column 3 results were used, considering that the experiment was \n\nconducted in continuous flow/saturation cycle (meaning that no changes in terms of \n\nconditions were induced directly in the column) and also the substantial number of \n\nsamples collected at outflow. \n\nThree of the major ions that show significant concentrations at outflow and are major \n\nconstituents of the minerals in the natural soil \u2013 calcium, magnesium and sodium. As \n\ninput, two mineral phases \u2013 calcite and dolomite \u2013 and three exchangers \u2013 CaX2, MgX2 \n\nand NaX \u2013 were considered. Mineral phases mass transfers between initial to final \n\nsolutions allow to understand if dissolution or precipitation processes occur. Exchangers \n\npresent cation exchange processes. \n\nThis inverse modelling approach can represent a simple way to understand the \n\nbehaviour of soil concerning retention of certain ions giving column outflow \n\nconcentrations. \n\n \n\n5.3.2. Results \n\nResults for Inverse Modelling process ran through PHREEQC are presented in Graph \n\n61. \n\nIt\u2019s important to refer that for mineral phases, positive values of concentration means \n\ndissolution in the second solution (outflow), as this is enriched in that element when \n\ncompared to the first solution (inflow). For the exchangers (CaX2, NaX and MgX2), \n\nnegative values in concentration means that it gave ions to the solution, enriching the \n\nsolution in the element of the exchanger. \n\n \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\nGraph 61 \u2013 Column 3 results for inverse modelling phases  \n\n \n\nFor comparison purposes, concentrations at outflow (in mols) for the selected set of ions \n\nare presented in Graph 62. \n\n \n\nGraph 62 \u2013 Column 3 outflow concentrations of ions considered in inverse modelling process \n\n\n\n119 \n\nConcerning the mineral phases analysed, inverse models where dolomite \n\ndissolution/precipitation occurs weren\u2019t considered, being given special attention to \n\nmodels that considered calcite and exchangers. This decision results from the fact that \n\nit is very unlike to occur dolomite precipitation or dissolution in such a small column. \n\nIn terms of processes that occur in the column for inflow solution to become outflow \n\nsolutions, it\u2019s possible to observe a positive phase transfer of calcite from the initial \n\nsolution to final solutions. It can be assumed that continuous dissolution of this mineral \n\nis occurring, and it\u2019s especially important in the first pore-volume. On the other hand an \n\ninverse behaviour is calculated for calcium exchanger, resulting negative phase transfers \n\nto it and therefore an enrichment of the solution concentrations at outflow. Considering \n\nthat inflow water composition does not vary throughout the experiment, it can be \n\nassumed that calcite dissolution and calcium washout occur, therefore large \n\nconcentrations are encountered in outflow solutions. This continuous dissolution can be \n\na positive factor in the retention of contaminants, such as metals. \n\nCalcium concentrations at outflow increase rapidly in the first two PV, and after that \n\nslowly decreases and seams to stabilize. Mineral phase (calcite) and calcium exchanger \n\nalso follow similar behaviour. \n\nMagnesium and sodium exchangers seam to follow the exact pattern as outflow \n\nconcentrations, but while magnesium exchanger tends to stabilize in positive phase \n\ntransfers, slowly retaining this element, sodium exchanger shows an increasing trend \n\n(positive phase transfers) for retention. This is somewhat contrary to what was expected. \n\nContinuously high outflow concentrations of Mg and Na when compared to inflow can be \n\nexplained by dissolution of other phases that were not considered in this analysis. If silica \n\nconcentration at both inflow and outflows was measured clay minerals interaction with \n\ninflow solution could be modelled (when considering additional mineral phases such as \n\nmontmorillonite or illite). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n120 \n\n6. Results discussion  \nConsidering the soil characteristics, and comparing both natural and soil mixtures it\u2019s \n\nexpected, due to the components used, that the later presents increased composition in \n\ncarbonates and organic matter. Both are expected to have significant effects in terms of \n\ncontaminant degradation and retention. Also, the increase in granulometry, by addition \n\nof artificial sand component (with granulomectric composition of approximately 98% \n\nabove 0.063 mm) resulted in an increase of flow rates at outflow, and therefore an \n\nincrease in permeability. This may also help in facing the possible long term effects of \n\nsoil washout processes resulting from the addition of organic soil. Column 6 (40% of \n\norganic soil) and Column 7 (30% of organic soil) showed a significant decrease in \n\nthickness resulting from particle washout processes (up to 3 cm in approximately 4 days \n\nof functioning). This was actually observed in the outflow water colour (slightly yellow). \n\nThis was not relevant in Column 8 and Column 9 where the decrease of organic soil \n\npercentage and increase of artificial sand component gave structure to the soil mixture, \n\nlessening the washout process. \n\nIn terms of soil behaviour, the soil mixture presents similar behaviour to natural soil \n\nconcerning the response to saturation cycles, with a rapid increase of flow rate and \n\ndecreasing as water above soil top is depleted. Besides that, soil mixture generally \n\nshowed higher results concerning permeability, both in short term (1 day) and long term \n\nperiods \u2013 Table 31. \n\nTable 31 \u2013 General summary of soil behaviour results \n\n  C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 \n\nExperiment  \ntime length (days) \n\n1 0.11 4.26 32.99 15.92 4 4 46 46 \n\nFlow rate \n(cm3/min) \n\nDay 1 0.846 - 0.869 0.363 1.504 7.722 2.572 3.340 4.341 \n\nExperiment \ntime \n\n0.846 1.457 0.789 0.174 0.543 4.931 1.789 0.792 1.272 \n\nPermeability \n(m/d) \n\nDay 1 1.353 - 1.445 0.589 2.536 12.579 3.557 3.278 4.562 \n\nExperiment \ntime \n\n1.353 2.480 1.312 0.282 0.915 8.032 2.474 0.777 1.337 \n\n \n\nConsidering the columns where quality component was analysed, C8 and C9 showed \n\ngood results in long term behaviour as both experiments were conducted for 46 days. \n\nC4 showed the worst results in both short and long time behaviour. Although several \n\nprocesses could have led to these results in this soil-column experiment, packing \n\nprocess of natural soil and immediate injection of wastewater are the apparent causes if \n\ncompared with Column 5 results (only two packing strikes instead of three and first cycle \n\nwas conducted with deionized water). This behaviour is consistent to Pavelic et al.

One keep in mind that \n\nColumn 5 only has two outflow samples, which do not allow for a detailed overview of \n\nthe general behaviour of the parameters considered. Column 8 has only 3 parameters in \n\nwhich outflow average concentration surpasses the inflow, suggesting an overall \n\nreduction of concentration in outflow besides the slight enrichment in inflow. Phosphorus \n\nshows the highest reduction in all columns. This is particularly useful taking into account \n\nthat this element is very common in wastewater matrix. \n\nConsidering that boron is a rare element at soils, and it is usually retained by organic \n\nmatter5, boron concentration decrease in outflow may have resulted from increased \n\npresence of organic matter in the soil mixture. Zinc is heavily retained by clay minerals, \n\nhydrated metal oxides and organic matter (Alloway, 1990) being a good indicator of the \n\n                                                \n5 http://www.soilandplantlaboratory.com/pdf/articles/BoronOverlookedEssential.pdf  \n\nhttp://www.soilandplantlaboratory.com/pdf/articles/BoronOverlookedEssential.pdf\n\n\n122 \n\neffects of a possible increase of organic matter in soil mixture. It is also important to note \n\nthat adsorption of Zn from soil solution by the solid soil particles is generally \n\naccompanied by simultaneous desorption of equivalent amounts of other cations from \n\nthe solid phase to the soil solution. \n\nNitrogen cycle components overall results are presented in Table 33. Again, outflow \n\n(OUT) values represent the average of all outflow concentrations. \n\nTable 33 \u2013 Nitrogen components results comparison (mg/L) \n\n \n\nParameter \nColumn 3 Column 4 Column 5 Column 8 \n\n IN OUT IN OUT IN OUT IN OUT \n\nN\nit\nro\n\ng\ne\n\nn\n \n\nc\ny\nc\nle\n\n Ammonia 32.80 1.36 34.20 1.45 34.20 0.65 48.90 1.99 \n\nNitrites 0.02 1.10 0.005 5.08 0.005 3.51 0.01 2.10 \n\nNitrates 0.27 0.86 2.00 2.00 2.00 6.51 2.00 140.45 \n\nNote: red values represent higher outflow concentrations compared to inflow \n\nThe general behaviour is similar in natural soil and soil mixture, with high concentration \n\nof ammonia at inflow and a reduction at outflow. Both soil mixture and natural soil show \n\nsimilar results also in nitrites, with low concentration at inflow and high concentration at \n\noutflow average. This suggests a transformation of ammonia in nitrites and nitrites into \n\nnitrates. Excluding Column 4, the inflow of all columns has lower concentration of nitrates \n\nthan outflow average. Although this may suggest that nitrites are being converted into \n\nnitrates, a careful investigation has to be taken considering the known problems with \n\nnitrates in SBM WWTP and the outflow average of Column 8. The first premise raises \n\nsome doubts in nitrates values measured in the inflow, as nitrates always show very low \n\nvalues in comparison to background data in the study area. The second statement is \n\nrelated to the possible constitution of the organic soil used, as the main reason for such \n\nhigh concentration in nitrates in outflow water can result from a high concentration in the \n\nsoil itself. This is not observed in the original soil. Besides this fact, similar behaviour with \n\nammonia was observed by Ollivier et al. (2013) in a soil-column experiment, where NH4\n+ \n\nwas the predominant form of nitrogen in the infiltrated treated wastewater but its \n\nconcentration decreased sharply with depth, in which NH4\n+ is oxidized to NO3\n\n- in aerated \n\nconditions. In the process NH4\n+ was retained in the uppermost soil layer and nitrification \n\noccurred in the top 1.5 m of soil. \n\nMajor ions results for all soil-column experiments are presented in Table 34. OUT refers \n\nto average of concentration per parameter at outflow sample. \n\nTable 34 \u2013 Major ions results comparison (mg/L) \n\n \n\nParameter \nColumn 3 Column 4 Column 5 Column 8 \n\n IN OUT IN OUT IN OUT IN OUT \n\nM\na\n\njo\nr \n\nio\nn\ns\n \n\nCalcium 29.4 76.5 43.6 95.30 43.6 103.39 37.8 132.2 \n\nChloride - 97.7 91.1 111.85 91.1 97.99 118 116.5 \n\nMagnesium 17.4 31.0 29 47.80 29 45.80 28.4 40.6 \n\nPhosphate 6.3 0.2 7.68 0.10 7.68 0.09 15.2 4.0 \n\nPotassium 16.7 10.6 14.8 7.11 14.8 15.84 23.6 29.9 \n\nSodium 58.0 39.0 71.6 56.80 71.6 22.53 92.5 83.3 \n\nSulphate 88.0 8.9 64.7 82.45 64.7 52.63 70.9 77.3 \n\nNote: red values represent higher outflow concentrations compared to inflow \n\n\n\n123 \n\nOverall behaviour is again similar in all columns, where a high concentration is measured \n\nat outflow for calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride. This suggest a and \n\ncontinuous washing out of the soil mineral matrix, with includes limestone, anorthite and \n\nmontmorillonite (bentonite). These minerals are rich in Ca, Mg, K, Na. Similar behaviour \n\nwas observed by Goren et al. (2011) where the recharge of secondary effluent into a \n\ncalcareous sandstone aquifer was accompanied by CaCO3 dissolution that increased \n\nthe Ca concentration in the reclaimed water resulting in increasing water hardness. \n\nHigh concentrations of chloride also suggest limestone reaction with acid solutions, \n\nalthough inflow concentration is not very different from outflow average. The main \n\nbehaviour of this element is to be persistent. \n\nSulphate concentration decreases in Column 3 (from 88 mg/L at inflow to 8.9 mg/L at \n\noutflow) and in Column 5 (64.7 mg/L to 52.63 mg/L), while Column 4 and Column 8 show \n\nan increase at outflow. The difference in concentration reduction between C3 and C5 \n\ncan be related to redox environment. C3 continuous inflow did not allow for the \n\noxygenation of column, creating an oxygen depleted environment, allowing SO4\n2- \n\ntransformation. This is not the case in C5, where the saturation cycles allow for the \n\noxygen presence in the column (at least in some sections). As Greskowiak et al. (2005) \n\ndemonstrated in infiltration basins, the abrupt change from saturated to unsaturated \n\nconditions causes the most significant geochemical changes, including the rapid \n\noxidation of sulphides accompanied by the dissolution of calcite. \n\nPhosphate concentration is highly reduced throughout the experiments, but more in the \n\nnatural soil. \n\nThe overall behaviour of Column 8 experiment concerning major ions is worse than that \n\nobserved for natural soil column experiments. This may be the result of the addition of \n\nartificial sand, enriching the soil with limestone thus resulting in an increased leaching of \n\nmajor ions. \n\nIt is also important to note that this soil-column experienced a long period of non \n\nsaturation (as discussed in Section 4.3.2.3.1) which resulted in a longer time of water-soil \n\ninteraction and better oxygenation (with longer water residence due to the enhanced \n\nwater retention capacity induced by OM) and therefore enhanced soil-water reactions, \n\nlowering pH in soil solution and increasing of desorption processes in metals. These \n\nwere latter mobilized when outflow flux was re-established. This can provide significant \n\ninformation about the saturation/desaturation periods and their effects for basin \n\nfunctioning procedures. \n\nIf ELV values from Legislative Decreed 236/98 are used as reference and compared to \n\naverage outflow values for each column (Table 35) it can be concluded that after soil-\n\ncolumn filtration outflow concentrations are below limits defined by law. This means that \n\nlimit values at discharge after treatment are respected. It\u2019s important to refer that from \n\nthe 26 parameters considered only six have emission limit values defined. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n124 \n\nTable 35 \u2013 Average outflow values vs ELV (Legislative decree 236/98) \n\n  Parameter \n\nLegislative \ndecree 236/98 \n\nColumn \n3 \n\nColumn \n4 \n\nColumn \n5 \n\nColumn \n8 \n\nELV (mg/L) \n\nM\ne\n\nta\nls\n\n \n\nAluminium - 0.0287 0.0110 0.0149 0.0179 \n\nAntimony - - - - 0.0194 \n\nBarium - 0.2431 0.4855 0.4420 0.3753 \n\nBoron - 0.2802 0.7805 0.7579 0.4392 \n\nChromium 2 - - - 0.0014 \n\nCopper 1 0.0075 0.0034 0.0108 0.0022 \n\nIron - 0.0241 0.0034 0.0066 0.0559 \n\nLithium - - - - 0.0152 \n\nManganese - 0.0578 0.4285 0.0547 0.5567 \n\nMolybdenum - 0.0025 - 0.0048 0.0054 \n\nNickel 2 0.0052 0.0094 0.0081 0.0036 \n\nPhosphorus 10 0.4173 0.0555 0.1023 1.2654 \n\nSelenium - - - - 0.0166 \n\nThallium - - - - 0.0145 \n\nVanadium - 0.0070 0.0025 0.0048 0.0011 \n\nZinc - 0.0031 0.0021 0.0060 0.0039 \n\nN\nit\nro\n\ng\ne\n\nn\n \n\nc\ny\nc\nle\n\n Ammonia - 1.36 1.45 0.65 1.99 \n\nNitrites   1.10 5.08 3.51 2.10 \n\nNitrates 50 0.86 2.00 6.51 140.45 \n\nM\na\n\njo\nr \n\nio\nn\ns\n \n\nCalcium - 76.5 95.30 103.39 132.2 \n\nChloride - 97.7 111.85 97.99 116.5 \n\nMagnesium - 31.0 47.80 45.80 40.6 \n\nPhosphate - 0.2 0.10 0.09 4.0 \n\nPotassium - 10.6 7.11 15.84 29.9 \n\nSodium - 39.0 56.80 22.53 83.3 \n\nSulphate 2000 8.9 82.45 52.63 77.3 \n\n \n\nIn a more conservative approach using as reference the maximum recommended values \n\nfor drinking water, a similar comparison to the average outflow concentration was made \n\n-Table 36.

In Column 3, outflow analysis showed carbamazepine, \n\ndiclofenac, gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide, ibuprofen, levetiracetam, naproxen and \n\nprimidone above LOR. Column 4 showed bezafibrate, carbamazepine diclofenac, \n\ngemfibrozil and naproxen concentrations above LOR at outflow, while in Column 5 \n\npresented concentration above LOR of bezafibrate, carbamazepine diclofenac, \n\ngemfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen. \n\nConcerning pH, Column 8 and Column 9 show slightly lower pH values at outflow in \n\ncomparison with Column 3, 4 and 5.

Besides the high dispersion of these parameters, \n\n\n\n126 \n\nthere seems to be a negative correlation between both, with inverse relation (decrease \n\nof pH results in increase of Eh) - Graph 63. \n\nThis information may be useful for further experiments, both in laboratory scale and \n\ninfiltration basin scale. \n\n \n\nGraph 63 \u2013 pH vs Eh for natural soil and soil mixture \n\n \n\nBatch experiment results for natural soil show similar results for soil-column experiments. \n\nFrom the both batch experiments results comparison soil mixture shows better effects \n\non supressing recalcitrant pharmaceuticals, where one out of 14 above LOR in inflow \n\nwas detected in outflow, namely carbamazepine. This element also occurs in the outflow \n\nof the batch conducted in natural soil, where seven out of 14 above LOR show persistent \n\nbehaviour. \n\nOther parameters also show better results in soil mixture, where average of percentage \n\nof removal is 63.7% vs 56.9% of natural soil. Also, the number of compounds that \n\nshowed concentration increase at outflow is higher in natural soil (13) than in soil mixture \n\n(9). \n\nThe increase of organic matter seems to have had a positive effect in terms of overall \n\ncontaminant reduction. But the selected organic soil must be carefully chosen. In the \n\nselected soil mixture, there were unexpected results concerning nitrates. Higher \n\nconcentrations at outflow can point to a possible contamination (accidental or intended \n\naddition) of these elements in the organic soil, since it is usually used as plants substrate. \n\nTo control this, a careful analysis should be conducted if the organic soil is commercial, \n\nbesides consulting the sellers\u2019 composition information. If possible this organic layer \n\nshould be created in controlled conditions if time constraints allow it. \n\nIn a practical approach, considering an average volume discharged every day from \n\nwastewater treatment plant of 900 m3/d (AdA and ERSAR, 2008), treated volume \n\npercentages can be calculated for the basins to be constructed based on the range of \n\nlaboratory flow rates obtained. For the two basins programed to be constructed (each \n\none with 15 m by 7 m = 105 m2 area), a reactive layer of the natural soil, wastewater \n\n\n\n127 \n\nvolume that could be infiltrated ranges from 6 to 24 % of the total SB Messines WWTP \n\noutflow volume considering flow rates obtained at column scale for day 1 of experiment \n\nand without taking into account clogging effects - Table 37. \n\nTable 37 \u2013 Treated volumes for natural soil at basin scale \n\n Flow rate \n\nTreated %  \nColumn scale \n(A = 0.002 m2) \n\nBasin scale \n(A = 210 m2) \n\n (cm3/min) (m3/d) (cm3/min) (m3/d) \n\nColumn 1 0.85 0.001 86967.99 125.23 13.91 \n\nColumn 2 1.46 0.002 149778.20 215.68 23.96 \n\nColumn 3 0.87 0.001 89332.37 128.64 14.29 \n\nColumn 4 0.36 0.0005 37316.05 53.74 5.97 \n\nColumn 5 1.50 0.002 154609.76 222.64 24.74 \n\n \n\nIf characteristics determined for C8 and C9 (that shown better endurance to soil washing \n\nout processes and good long term behaviour) are considered, a reactive layer installed \n\nat the basin bottom can treat up to 71% of the considered average volume discharged \n\ndaily in perfect conditions (i.e. no clogging effects) - Table 38. Again, flow rates \n\nconsidered correspond to 1 day of experiment in both columns. If flow rates for all the \n\nexperiment time length (44 days) are considered the treated percentage decreases to \n\n13% in Column 8 and 21% in Column 9. \n\nTable 38 \u2013 Treated volumes for soil mixture at basin scale \n\n Flow rate \n\nTreated % \n \n\nColumn scale \n(A = 0.002 m2) \n\nBasin scale \n(A = 210 m2 each) \n\n (cm\n3/min) (m3/d) (cm3/min) (m3/d) \n\nColumn 8 3.34 0.005 343348.80 494.42 54.94 \n\nColumn 9 4.34 0.006 446250.63 642.60 71.40 \n\n \n\n6.1. Uncertainty associated with soil-column experiments \n\nUncertainty in the methodologies and procedures adopted can cause some lack of \n\nconfidence in results, this is why for the sake of future research this must be described. \n\nA brief analysis of uncertainty must be conducted for the sole reason to understand the \n\nlimitations of this type of experiments and also to keep track of the lacking information. \n\nEffects of soil packing are somewhat dependent of, as previously seen, number of strikes \n\n(drops), but not only. The effect of weight dropping can change from user to user, and \n\nit\u2019s not possible to replicate with high confidence the same column. Even the dry filling \n\nprocedure of the column, natural granulometric selection can occur and different \n\ninterface can be created inside the soil column. \n\nConcerning column assembling uncertainty factors a parallel benchmark was conducted \n\nin Column 8 and Column 9. The soil mixture that was used in the soil column had exactly \n\nthe same composition. The same person conducted the filling and packing process in \n\n\n\n128 \n\nboth columns, following the exactly same steps. Pre-experiment saturation process was \n\nconducted in parallel and after experiment start the saturation cycles started at exactly \n\nthe same time with the same water matrix being injected. Given those careful procedures \n\nto replicate every step in both columns the results were in fact different. Column 8 had a \n\nlower permeability than Column 9, and flow rates were repeatedly lower. After the \n\nexperiment was discontinued, both soils where removed from the column and carefully \n\nobserved. No evidences of preferential flow channels were observed. \n\nUncertainty in concentrations measured in column outflow samples or SBM WWTP \n\neffluent samples analysis for determination of pharmaceuticals concentration can be \n\nconsidered minor, since the values obtained are in the same interval scale, although \n\nconditions of sampling varied. Besides that fact, higher values at outflow than for inflow \n\nfor pharmaceuticals were detected in column 3, 4 and 5. Both inflow and outflow sample \n\nconservation followed strict conservation rules, being kept in low temperatures previous \n\nto laboratory analysis. \n\nThe reasonable cause for this, and considering that there are no pharmaceutical \n\ncompounds in the soil previous to the soil-column experiments, may be the fractioning \n\nprocess conducted in the inflow samples. After the SBM WWTP was collected in large \n\ncontainer, it was divided into several smaller glass vials for both conservation and also \n\nfor gradual infiltration in the column experiments. This fractioning process may have \n\ncaused some kind of compound partition due to differentiated settling inside the main \n\ncontainer before being divided into parts, thus having different concentrations in different \n\nbottles. The result may be that the outflow concentrations may not be representative of \n\nthe values measured in one inflow analysis. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n129 \n\n7. Synthesis, conclusions and recommendations \nSoil-Aquifer Treatment (SAT) in Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) systems is a \n\nrecharge option aiming to improve the quality of the recharged water while augmenting \n\nthe water availability, helping to address water scarcity challenges.  \n\nIn SAT-MAR basins, water percolates through the soil matrix under controlled conditions \n\ninducing water pre-treatment. In fact, as the effluent moves through the soil, natural soil \n\nfiltration occurs and water undergoes significant quality improvements through physical, \n\nchemical and biological processes. \n\nOne of the main existing challenges of SAT-MAR is to control and maintain the infiltration \n\nrates and avoid clogging due to physical, chemical and biological processes taking place \n\nduring the transport of water through the unsaturated and saturated zone. Soil-column \n\nexperiments are frequently used to get information on the soil behaviour under controlled \n\nconditions.  \n\nIn the framework of this dissertation carried out under EU MARSOL project \n\n(www.marsol.eu), several soil-column experiments were conducted at LNEC LASUB \n\nlaboratory using a soil collected in SB Messines wastewater treatment plant, one of the \n\nAlgarve demo sites. This dissertation presents the results obtained concerning the soil \n\nflow rate variations under different conditions, aiming at verifying the soil suitability for \n\ninfiltration media in basins. It also presents the results for the improvement in water \n\nquality resulting from the soil capacity for sorption and biodegradation of the pollutants.  \n\nThe laboratory experiments performed allowed gathering information on the short and \n\nlong term behaviour, at laboratory scale, of S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines natural soil \n\nand a soil mixture produced from it, providing the basis for deciding the best soil \n\ncomposition to be used in the SAT-MAR facility to be installed in SB Messines WWTP. \n\nThe first conclusion that can be drawn in that the soil collected in the outskirts of the SB \n\nMessines WWTP has shown some suitability to be used as a base infiltration layer for \n\nthe SAT-MAR infiltration basins, in what concerns the infiltration capacity, but is expected \n\nto have some problems in the long term, with a continuous decrease in permeability. This \n\nhas led to the need of a new soil composition mixture.  \n\nThe production of a soil mixture composed of organic soil and \u201cartificial sand\u201d from \n\ncrushed limestone mixed with natural SBM soil, resulted in a more pervious material with \n\na good long term hydraulic behaviour, with better response to saturation/unsaturation \n\ncycles. Although organic matter percentage has increased the soil washout processes \n\nand compaction resulting from particle rearrangement, this was not very problematic for \n\nthe permeability rates at long term. \n\nConsidering the average volume of 900 m3/d discharged every day from wastewater \n\ntreatment plant (AdA and ERSAR, 2008), the potential treated volume percentages were \n\ncalculated for the basins to be constructed (each one with 15 m by 7 m = 105 m2 area), \n\nbased on the range of laboratory flow rates obtained. \n\nFor the two basins with a reactive layer of natural soil, the wastewater volume that could \n\nbe infiltrated ranges from 6 \u2013 24 % of the total SB Messines WWTP outflow volume, \n\nhttp://www.marsol.eu/\n\n\n130 \n\nconsidering the flow rates obtained at column scale for day 1 of experiment and without \n\ntaking into account clogging effects (Table 37). \n\nConsidering the soil mixture (40% natural soil, 40% artificial sand and 20% organic soil), \n\nwhich has shown better endurance to soil washing out processes and good long term \n\nbehaviour, a reactive layer installed at the basin bottom could treat up to 71% of the \n\nconsidered average volume discharged daily if no clogging effects are considered (Table \n\n38). If flow rates measured at the end of experiment (44 days) are considered, treated \n\npercentage decreases to 21% of the daily discharged volume. \n\nThe removal of contaminants in the wastewater of SB Messines was analysed aiming to \n\nunderstand the best conditions for improving the water quality for the following main \n\ngroup of contaminants: metals, nitrogen cycle, pharmaceuticals and major ions. \n\nBoth natural soil and different soil mixtures were studied using cycles of saturation and \n\nnon-saturation, the latter allowing the oxygenation of the soil column. The main \n\nconclusions that can be drawn are: (1) the presence of a soil mixture with an organic \n\nmatter (OM) layer favours the retention/degradation (mainly through sorption and \n\nbiotransformation processes) of most pharmaceuticals studied, as well as heavy metals \n\n(retained both in clay fraction and OM); (2) the sequence of oxic/anoxic conditions is the \n\nbest approach to ensure maximum attenuation efficiency, since some elements degrade \n\nbetter in oxic conditions (for example for the biological oxidation of ammonia into nitrite, \n\nnitrate and nitrogen gas), and others are degraded under anaerobic conditions (example \n\nfor several pharmaceuticals); and (3) the existence of high pH favours the retention of \n\nheavy metals attached to soils. \n\n \n\n7.1. Recommendations \n\nGiven the results obtained, concerning both hydraulic and quality aspects, a set of \n\nconsiderations/recommendations can be made: \n\n? The experimental results obtained in laboratory, both for permeability and \n\nrecharge water quality, are different from basin scale experiments. This results \n\nfrom scaling factors as well as the natural soil heterogeneity, together with local \n\ndifferences resulting from changes in vegetation, topography or man activity.  \n\n? The exposure to field conditions that can vary widely, and are not possible to \n\ncontrol as in soil-column experiments. At infiltration basin scale other processes, \n\nsuch as root growth in the reactive layer, could benefit the long-time hydraulic \n\nbehaviour by smoothing the clogging effects, but on the other hand uncontrolled \n\neffluent (with the natural variations that a wastewater can experience) can have \n\nadverse results in the basin operational status. \n\n? The increase in the organic matter content in the soil used for SAT-MAR has \n\nshown general improvement of the outflow water quality when compared with the \n\ninflow. Thus, if the natural soil to be used as reactive layer has low concentration \n\nof organic matter, it should be integrated in a soil mixture, e.g. in the form of \n\nhumus or peat. \n\n? The increase of organic matter can result in lowering the soil resistance, due to \n\nthe increase in porosity resultant from the washing out processes; the latter \n\n\n\n131 \n\ncreates preferential flow paths, cavities and air pockets that led to the thickness \n\ndecrease of the reactive layer. Consequently, the addition of a skeleton \n\ncomponent can be useful to avoid these phenomena. \u201cArtificial sand\u201d, which is \n\nan inexpensive material produced from limestone crushing, was a good example \n\nto increase permeability and also to give structure to the soil, without any relevant \n\nimpact in terms of quality at outflows as the matrix of this component is the same \n\nas the natural soil (limestone). \n\n? The implementation of a procedure of saturation/unsaturation cycles allows the \n\nsoil to oxygenate, enabling the degradation/retention of compounds under \n\noxidation reactions, as well as periods of oxygen depleted environment that \n\nenhance anaerobic degradation. This will also reduce biological clogging effects, \n\nas the small turbulence of inflow water and air exposure can hinder biofilm \n\nproduction on the soil top. \n\n? The implementation of too large periods (more than 1-2 days) of non-saturation \n\nconditions should be avoided to prevent drastic changes in pH and redox \n\nconditions which can result namely in the remobilization of metals (Graph \n\n37,Graph 38,Graph 39 and Graph 52). \n\n? The inflow water should be equally distributed along the reactive layer and water \n\ninflux should be relatively low. This allows avoiding turbulence and the creation \n\nof suspended solids as well as the remobilization of contaminants retained in the \n\nsoil matrix. \n\n? Finally, although soil analysis results showed little to none concentration of \n\npharmaceuticals retained in it, it\u2019s expected that this reactive layer can have high \n\ncontaminant concentration. Therefore, this reactive layer should be treated as a \n\nhazardous material, and if substitution is necessary due to maximum lifespan \n\nachievement, it should be collected, contained and afterwards destroyed to avoid \n\nadditional pollution problems. \n\n \n\n7.2. Research needs \n\nFurther studies will be conducted at the SAT-MAR basin scale that will help enriching \n\nthe conclusions of this dissertation. \n\nIn terms of what was learned and considering the limitations of these experiments, \n\nseveral research needs are proposed: \n\n? To confirm the presence of microorganisms capable of degrading \n\npharmaceuticals in the column, particularly in the natural soil/soil mixture. These \n\nmicroorganisms with biodegradation potential can originate from the soil itself \n\ncollected from the field site or injected with inflow water. This information would \n\nhelp understanding the degradation/transformation processes that occurred \n\ninside the columns.  \n\n? To monitor real time changes in parameters. This could help understanding the \n\ndegradation processes and the importance of redox potential (Eh), total organic \n\ncarbon (TOC), nutrients and pH, among others, in the chemical and biological \n\nprocesses occurring in the column. For example, the value in Eh and the \n\nconsumption/production of oxidants can give insight into the types and extent of \n\n\n\n132 \n\nbiodegradation processes related with the decrease in pharmaceuticals \n\nconcentration. \n\n? To define the amount of organic matter needed to achieve good results. The \n\naddition of organic matter certainly had an effect in the retention of \n\npharmaceuticals, but a larger number of soil-column experiments and batch \n\nexperiments would be necessary to establish the most effective amount of OM to \n\nbe added without compromising the reactive layer structure and retention \n\ncapacity. \n\n? To investigate other possible pre-existent contaminants in the organic soil to be \n\nmixed with original soil, aiming to prevent further contamination problems. \n\n? To develop new soil-column and batch experiments using spiked concentrations \n\n(with known concentrations) of certain contaminants, allowing analysing the soil \n\nbehaviour with water having higher concentrations than those used (but \n\nmaintaining the same wastewater contaminants and emerging contaminants).  \n\nThe knowledge achieved, particularly in quality of outflow aspects, may be of relevance \n\nto the legal framework, helping to establish reference values to the injection/infiltration \n\nwater quality and suitable soils (and places) and materials to use in SAT-MAR \n\nprocesses, to produce successful results with minimum negative environmental impacts \n\nand an acceptable economic outcome. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n133 \n\nBibliographic References \n \n\nAbel, C.
