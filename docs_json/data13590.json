The software Phase2, from Rocscience Inc. was employed in \nthe analyses. Despite being a method applicable to continuous rock masses, disconti-\nnuities may be included in the model using joint elements. Modeling is simpler, avoid-\ning the difficulties of using distinct element methods, due to the relative complexity \nof the geological section examined, where it was necessary to represent the variability \nof the foliation attitude, due to the pattern of the observed folds. The consideration \nof this variability was essential to reproduce buckling failure. Back analyses of failure \nmechanism were done, leading to representative values of the in situ stress state and \nthe normal and shear stiffness modulus of the foliation discontinuities. The param-\neters generated by the analyses are extremely useful for further stability analyses in the \nphyllite slopes of Pau Branco Mine.     \n\nKeywords: failure mechanism, flexural buckling, mining slope stability, stress-strain \nanalyses\n\nResumo\nNesse trabalho, o mecanismo de ruptura por flambagem flexural ocorrido na \n\nMina Pau Branco, do Grupo Vallourec &amp; Mannesman, em 2002, foi estudado a partir \nda aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de modelagem num\u00e9rica por elementos finitos.

Introduction\n\nRock masses of weak metamor-\nphic rocks associated to the presence of \nintense tectonic activity are propitious \nto many failure modes in slopes. In \nsome cases these rock masses behave \nas pseudo-continuum or equivalent \ncontinuum, especially if the alteration \ngrade is high. However, even with high \nalteration grade, these rock masses \npresent preserved geologic structures \nthat can result in structural controlled \nfailure mechanisms. Another possibil-\nity is the occurrence of hybrid failure \nmechanisms involving intact rock \nand discontinuities. In slope mines, \nespecially in high ones, failure mecha-\n\nnisms are associated with considerable \ndeformation, requiring a stress-strain \nanalysis to provide the correct under-\nstanding and representation of the \nfailure process.\n\nSj\u00f6berg (2000) discusses many \npossible failure mechanisms in large-\nscale rock slope mines. This author \npresents a comprehensive literature \nreview on failure mechanisms in mine \nslopes, which focused on the author\u2019s \nunderstanding and analysis of physi-\ncal process involved. Some of these \nmechanisms are studied by Sj\u00f6berg \n(2000) through numerical analysis. \nOne of the mechanisms presented by \n\nSj\u00f6berg (2000) that has received little \nattention in the literature is buckling. \nThis author describes this mechanism \nand presents kinematic conditions for \nits occurrence. \n\nCavers (1981) was one of the few \nauthors to study the buckling failure \nmechanism in slopes. In his work he \ndiscusses the flexural and the three-\nhinge buckling failure mechanisms \n(see Figure 1).\n\nIn Cavers\u2019 work (1981) simplified \nmodels for buckling and three-hinge \nbuckling are proposed. In the case of \nflexural buckling, linear elastic behav-\nior is assumed for the buckling column. \n\nFigure 1\nBuckling failure mechanism: (a) flexure \nbuckling; (b) three-hinge buckling (after \nCavers, 1981).\n\nCavers (1981) proposed a critical height \nfor the occurrence of flexural buckling, \nbased on Euler\u2019s theory. \n\n In case of three-hinge buckling, \nrock blocks are considered rigid. Cav-\ners\u2019 proposal is based on limit equilib-\nrium methods.\n\nPerhaps, due to arbitrary simplifi-\ncations assumed by Cavers (1981), his \nmodels do not yield coherent results \nneither for flexural nor for three-hinge \nbuckling failure in phyllite slope mines.\n\n Adhikary et. al. (2001) discuss \nthe occurrence of toppling and buckling \nflexural mechanisms in foliated rock \nmasses, focusing their occurrence in \nslope mines (see Figure 2).\n\n   Based on numerical models, \nAdhikary et. al. (2001) also proposed \na critical height to the occurrence of \nflexural buckling in large-scale rock \nslopes, subject to larger deformations. \nTheir results contradicted Cavers\u2019 \nmodel (1981). \n\nIn Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero (MG, \nBrazil), a region of rich mineral depos-\nits of iron and gold, the occurrence of \nbuckling was observed in two slope \nmines, in C\u00f3rrego do S\u00edtio mine (Santa \nB\u00e1rbara) and in Pau Branco mine (Al-\nphaville), as showed in Figures 3 and \n4. In both cases, failure occurred in \nphyllite slopes.\n\nIn the C\u00f3rrego do S\u00edtio gold mine \nbuckling occurred as a local failure \nmechanism in a bench slope (see Figure \n\nFigure 2 \nFailure mechanisms in foliated rock \nslopes: (a) flexural toppling; (b) flexural \nbuckling   (after Adhikary et al., 2001).\n\n\n\n83\n\nCarolina Helena Caldeira Silva et al.\n\nREM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(1), 81-86, jan. mar. | 2014\n\n3). Lopes (2006) demonstrated that \nthis failure mode has had no influence \nin global slope stability. This author \nstudied a major failure occurrence in \nthe slope of Figure 3 through numeri-\ncal analysis; the results showed that \n\nthe mechanism was a circular one com-\nbined with plane shear failure. \n\n In Pau Branco iron mine buckling \nfailure reached many benches of phyllite \nrock slope (see Figure 4). This failure is \nstudied in this work through numerical \n\nmodels to permit the comprehension \nof the failure process. Also the carry-\ning load conditions involved and the \nstrength and deformability parameters \nof the rock mass and discontinuities \nwere determined by back-analysis.\n\n2.

A second folding \nevent, with axis nearly perpendicular \nto the major one, E-W, seems to be res-\nponsible for the winding pattern of the \nlayers and for relatively abrupt changes \nin the general strike of foliation (Figure \n5). \n\nFigure 5 \nFolding with direction axis E-W, in the \n\nWest Slope. \n\nNumerical model features \n\nBuckling failure occurred as a glo-\nbal failure mechanism, affecting many \nbenches. Large deformations were ob-\nserved; see Figure 4. A stress-strain \nanalysis is the best method for evalua-\nting slopes affected by this mechanism \nbecause it considers the deformations of \nthe rock mass.\n\nThe finite element method was \nchosen to study the failure mode oc-\ncurred in the West Slope of Pau Branco \nMine. The software Phase2, Rocscience \n(Canada), was used in the analyses. \n\nStress- strain analyses permitted \nthe back-analysis of the failure mode. \nThe main goals of the analyses were a \nbetter understanding of the phenome-\nnon, as well as the calibration of rock \nmass geomechanical parameters. \n\nBuckling failure occurred in 2002, \naffecting many benches. A geological \npreliminary model to understand the \nphenomenon, proposed by a consul-\nting company (BVP Engenharia, 2007), \nwas used in the analyses. This model is \nrepresented by a typical geological sec-\n\ntion, see Figure 6. The foliation trace \nof the rock mass in Figure 6 shows the \ndip variability of this structure, due to \nfolding, as described earlier and already \nillustrated in Figure 5.\n\nFolding of the foliation, with the \nconsequent verticalization of this struc-\nture creates the favorable kinematic \nconditions for buckling occurrence. \nDue to impact of the failure, it has been \nmandatory to maintain a hematite por-\ntion below the dolomitic phyllite to con-\ntinue safe mining. \n\nFigure 6\nProposed geologic model (BVP, 2007).\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\nThe simplified geological model \nused in the analyses is presented in Figure \n7, with the finite element mesh generated \nin Phase2. Foliation discontinuities were \nexplicitly inserted in the model, using \njoint elements, only in buckling occur-\n\nrence region to decrease computational \neffort. A discontinuity spacing of 1m was \nused in the analysis to represent the ob-\nserved spacing of layers affected by bu-\nckling in 2007. The discontinuities in the \nsuperior portion of the model have a dip \n\nvalue of 60\u00b0, which gradually increases \nto 80\u00b0 in the inferior part of the model, \nto represent the folding of the foliation \n(Figure 6).\n\nThe mesh definition was obtained \nthrough trial and error.

Mohr-Coulomb slip \njoint criterion was used for the discon-\n\ntinuities. Shear strength discontinuity \nproperties were also obtained from in-\nternal mine reports.  \n\nShear and normal stiffness of dis-\ncontinuities were calibrated by back-\nanalyses. Initial values of joint stiffness \nwere calculated according to the follo-\nwing expressions from Barton &amp; Chou-\nbey (1977) and Bandis et al. (1983):\n\nFigure 8 \nDiscontinuity deformed boundaries, showing \nbuckling failure.\n\nin Figure 8, which shows the deformed \nboundaries of discontinuities. A scale \nfactor to increase the size of deformed \nboundaries was used to allow the vi-\nsualization of the model deformation \nmode. Buckling failure affected many \n\nbenches, so it could be interpreted as \na global model failure; it is clear from \nFigure 8.\n\nYielded elements in the model are \nshown in Figure 9. Tension crack occur-\nrences are observed along the slope top, \n\nin the whole extension of the model, as \ndescribed in BVP Engenharia report \n(2007).

Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(1), 81-86, jan. mar. | 2014\n\nThe numerical modeling of bu-\nckling failure in Pau Branco Mine was \nvery useful for the estimation of geome-\nchanical parameters of the rock mass \nand the discontinuities.\n\nFolding pattern of the foliation \nwith consequent verticalization of this \nstructure creates the kinematic favora-\nble conditions of buckling failure. The \n\nrepresentation of this pattern in the \nmodel was fundamental to obtain con-\nsistent results. On the other hand, the \nmodel achieves great complexity and \nconvergence is reached after a large \nnumber of interactions. A small chan-\nge in the input data can cause collapse \nof the model. If the discontinuities are \nremoved from the model, displacements \n\ndecrease considerably; the collapse risk \nis smaller and there in no formation of \ntension cracks in the slope top.\n\nThe use of a numerical model for \ndiscontinuous rock masses, as the dis-\ntinct element method, would be of great \ninterest to refine this study and to im-\nprove the understanding of the failure \nmode.\n\nFigure 9\nYielded elements in the model..\n\n5.
