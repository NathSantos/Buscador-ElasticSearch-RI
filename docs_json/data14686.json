The fossils are relatively common and represent several taxonomic groups of the Pleistocene megafauna. \nAlthough the systematics of the fossil assemblage is well known, the relative proportions among taxonomic groups and their \nskeletal elements have not been evaluated yet. Here are presented the results of a survey of the diversity of skeletal elements \nand taxa among 2,391 specimens belonging to the paleontological collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande \n(FURG). The survey revealed that the most common taxa are the artiodactyls, ground sloths, glyptodontids and toxodontids, \nwhile carnivores, rodents and litopterns are very scarce. The most abundant skeletal elements are osteoderms of cingulates \n(mostly glyptodontids) and teeth of other groups. Although paleoecological and paleoenvironmental inferences are very \nhard to obtain because the fossils do not have a stratigraphic setting, encompass a wide time span, of some 700 ky BP, and \nrepresent several environments and climates, some patterns of taxonomic abundance are apparently related to ecological \nfactors, while others seem to result from taphonomic processess. \n\nKey words: megafauna, Pleistocene, Southern Brazil, continental shelf.\n\nRESUMO \u2013  F\u00f3sseis de mam\u00edferos terrestres procedentes da plataforma continental do sul do Brasil s\u00e3o conhecidos desde o \ns\u00e9culo 19.

Similar fossils have also been found on the \nArgentinean continental shelf, in front of the estuary of the \nLa Plata River (Cione et al., 2005) and the coast of Buenos \nAires Province (Tonni &amp; Cione, 1999), and on the northeastern \nUruguayan coast (Rinderknecht, 2006). In Brazil, fossils of \nterrestrial mammals preserved on the continental shelf have \n\nbeen recorded from the coast of Rio Grande do Sul State since \nthe late 19th century, when German naturalist Hermann Von \nIhering described in a letter to Argentinean naturalist Florentino \nAmeghino the presence of some osteoderms of glyptodonts on \nthe beach (Ameghino, 1891). Recently, the presence of such \nremains in deeper areas of the shelf, collected by fishermen, has \nalso been published (Lopes &amp; Buchmann, 2010). The studies \non such fossils have been aimed mostly at their taxonomic \nidentification (e.g. Cunha, 1959; Paula Couto &amp; Cunha, 1965; \nOliveira, 1992, 1996; Rodrigues &amp; Ferigolo, 2004; Rodrigues \net al., 2004; Scherer, 2005; Marcon, 2007; Scherer et al., 2009). \nOther studies have focused on the distribution of such remains \n\n\n\nREVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 15(1), 201258\n\nalong the coast (Buchmann, 1994), their taphonomy (Lopes et \nal., 2008) and ages (Lopes et al., 2010).\n\nThe fossils are found disarticulated, exhibiting signs of post \nmortem breakage and abrasion (Lopes et al., 2008). They come \nfrom large concentrations of marine and terrestrial skeletal \nremains on the inner continental shelf, at depths between 0 and \n20 m (Figueiredo, 1975; Buchmann, 2002). During autumn and \nwinter, storm waves erode these concentrations and transport the \nfossils to the beach, where they are collected. Besides terrestrial \nmammals, the concentrations also contain remains of marine \nmollusks (Lopes &amp; Buchmann, 2008), corals, echinoderms, \ncrustaceans (Buchmann, 1994; Lopes, 2011), teleost (Richter, \n1987) and elasmobranch fishes (Buchmann &amp; Rinc\u00f3n Filho, \n1997), pinnipeds (Oliveira &amp; Drehmer, 1997), cetaceans (Cunha, \n1982; Ribeiro et al., 1998), seabirds (Lopes et al., 2006) and \nreptiles (Hsiou &amp; Fortier, 2007; Hsiou, 2009).\n\nThe presence of terrestrial fossil mammals in a modern \nmarine environment is attributed to the existence of Pleistocene \ncontinental fossiliferous deposits that were reworked by sea-\nlevel oscillations. During the Quaternary glacial maxima, the \nocean levels reached some 130 m below present-day levels, \nthus exposing large areas of the continental shelves all around \nthe world that were occupied by terrestrial environments and \nwere covered and reworked by sea level rises at the end of \nglaciations (Lopes &amp; Buchmann, 2010). Recent ages obtained \nby Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) on seven fossil teeth from \nthe southern Brazilian continental shelf revealed that the fossils \nare between 650 \u00b1 100 and 18 \u00b1 3 ky BP, and represent several \n\ntemporally distinct fossil assemblages (Lopes et al., 2010). The \nlarge age span, the co-occurrence of fossils that indicate arid \nand open environments such as Reithrodon Waterhouse, 1837 \nand Dolichotinae rodents, and other records (Cunha, 1959; \nRodrigues &amp; Ferigolo, 2004) such as Tapirus Brunnich, 1772, \nHydrochoerus Brisson, 1762 and Myocastor Kerr, 1792 that \nindicate permanently humid or forested environments, plus the \nlack of a precise stratigraphic context, difficult paleocommunity \nreconstructions based on fossils from the continental shelf.\n\nAlthough the fossils are somewhat common and several \nmammalian groups are recognized from these deposits (Table \n1), until now there has been no detailed survey regarding \nthe relative proportions among taxa, given that the available \ntaxonomic studies are based on specific groups and isolated \nspecimens. Here is presented a survey of the relative proportions \nof mammalian taxa and respective skeletal elements found on the \nsouthern Brazilian continental shelf. The present survey is aimed \nat improving the knowledge regarding such taxa and evaluating \npatterns that may have influenced taxonomic and anatomic \nrepresentativity. Although representing distinct assemblages \nwith different ages, mixed together by erosive processes related \nto sea-level oscillations, for the purposes of the present study all \nfossils are considered as a single assemblage.\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING\n\nThe Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul State (CPRS) was \nformed after the split between South America and Africa in the \n\nTable 1.

Between \nthe Neogene and Quaternary the morphology of the CPRS was \naffected by glacioeustatic oscillations, which led to the formation \nof two major depositional systems: the Alluvial Fans System and \nthe Pleistocene-Holocene Complex Multiple Barrier (Villwock \n&amp; Tomazelli, 1995).\n\nThe latter unit is subdivided into four large barrier-lagoon \ndepositional systems and associated features. Each barrier-\nlagoon was formed by a marine transgression, correlated to late \nPleistocene-Holocene interglacial episodes (Tomazelli et al., \n2000). The constituent sediments are essentially siliciclastic, \n\nwell-sorted and mature sands, with small amounts of organic \nmatter, biogenic carbonate, diagenetic clays and concentrations \nof heavy minerals (Villwock &amp; Tomazelli, 1995).\n\nThe continental shelf, which constitutes the submerged \nportion of the CPRS, has a low slope (average ratio of 1:1.000) \nand the shelf break is located at depths between 80 and 120 \nmeters. The middle-central portion of the shelf is wide, \nmorphologically reworked and presents paleofluvial channels \nand sand banks (Corr\u00eaa et al., 1996). During the Holocene \ntransgression of 6-7 ky BP, variations in the rates of sea-level \nrise promoted the reworking and concentration of clastic \nterrigenous sediments and formed abrasion terraces on the \nshelf (Kowsmann &amp; Costa, 1974; Martins et al., 1996). The \ndeposits of the shelf containing terrestrial remains were formed \nduring sea-level regressions, when large portions of the then \nexposed shelf were occupied by terrestrial ecosystems (Lopes \net al., 2010; Lopes &amp; Buchmann, 2010).\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSystematic collecting of fossils along the beaches of Rio \nGrande do Sul State has been performed in the last 15 years \nby researchers from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande \n(FURG). The collection sites are concentrated in the southern \nportion of the coast, between the estuary of Patos Lagoon and \nChu\u00ed Creek. During these activities, 1 km-long sections of the \ncoast, between the surf zone and frontal dunes, are surveyed \nfor fossils and geological samples. The remains are found \ndisarticulated and exhibit signs of abrasion by transport; \nmost fossils are incomplete, and compact-shaped elements \nsuch as osteoderms, astragali and phalanges are generally the \nbest preserved (Lopes et al., 2008). The occurrence of fossils \nalong the coast is not uniform (Buchmann, 1994). The largest \nconcentration of mammalian remains is found in a ~40 km-long \nsector where large and thick konzentrat-lagerst\u00e4tte of fossil \nmarine shells, called \u201cconcheiros\u201d (Figure 2) are formed on \nthe beach by redeposition of bioclasts transported from the \ncontinental shelf by storm waves (Figueiredo Jr., 1975).\n\nThe studied specimens, a total of 2,391 fossils, are deposited \nin the paleontological collection of FURG. Each specimen \nwas identified to the lowest taxonomic category where \npossible, and classified as cranial elements (skulls, mandibles, \nantlers), isolated teeth, axial elements (vertebrae and ribs), \nappendicular elements (scapulae and long bones), podials \n(carpals, metacarpals, tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges) and \naccessory elements (osteoderms, caudal tubes). \nAbbreviations.

The most common \ncranial elements are incomplete cervid antlers and fragments \nof the occipital portion of skulls; the most complete skull \nis almost unrecognizable, but seems to be of a ground sloth \n\nFigure 1.

The most \ncommon podial elements are astragali (Figures 4B, C), followed \nby phalanges and carpals/tarsals (Figure 4D). Long bones are \nrepresented essentially by incomplete specimens (Figures 4E-G). \nVertebrae include complete specimens, but most are incomplete \nor fragments represented by centra without neural arches and \nisolated neural spines, difficult to assign to any specific taxon. \nScapulae and ribs are all incomplete specimens.\n\nOf the total analyzed specimens, 214 could not be \ntaxonomically identified due to reworking by marine dynamics, \n\nFigure 3.

Not in scale 1/1.\n\nwhich destroys most of the diagnostic characters by abrasion \nand/or fragmentation (Lopes et al., 2008). These include 121 \nvertebrae, 33 podials, 26 long bones, 22 scapulae, 9 skulls \nand 3 ribs. The remaining 2,177 elements could be assigned \nto several taxonomic groups (Figure 5), but not all known taxa \nfrom the continental shelf are represented, among them the \nrodents and canids. The most common taxa are artiodactyls, \nrepresented mostly by antler fragments, podials and teeth. \nAmong the antlers, 145 could be identified, being 28 of Antifer \nAmeghino, 1,889 and 117 of Morenelaphus Carette, 1922; the \nremaining 167 could not be assigned to any specific genus due \nto abrasion and fragmentation. Podials and teeth of this group \nare very common and well preserved; however, a detailed \nrevision is needed in order to distinguish between cervids and \ncamelids. The medium-sized taxa (those with body mass between \n10 and 100 kg, according to estimates by Fari\u00f1a et al., 1998), \nrepresented by cervids, are the most common, followed by large-\nsized ones (body masses between 100 and more than 1000 kg), \nsuch as glyptodontids, ground sloths, toxodontids, litopterns, \nproboscideans and carnivores. Although Fari\u00f1a et al. (1998) \nand Cione et al. (2003) did not provide estimates of body mass \nfor pampatheriids and proterotheriids, these can be considered \nmedium-sized taxa.\n\nCingulate xenarthrans are very common, with glyptodontids \nas the most conspicuous group, followed by pampatheriids and \n\n\n\n61AIRES &amp; LOPES  \u2013  QUATERNARY MAMMALS FROM SOUTHERN BRAZIL\n\nincomplete caudal tubes attributed to Panochthus. Pampatheriids \nare represented by 116 osteoderms of Pampatherium Ameghino, \n1875 and 53 of Holmesina Simpson, 1930. The most numerous \nare the elongated, subrectangular osteoderms of the mobile \nbelt, although elements from the cephalic shield and pelvic and \npectoral bucklers are common. The genus Pachyarmatherium \nDowning &amp; White, 1995 is represented by only three osteoderms. \nThis taxon was only recently described from fossiliferous \ndeposits of the continental shelf (Bostelmann et al., 2008; \nRibeiro, 2008) and also from Pleistocene deposits in northeastern \nBrazil (Porpino et al., 2009). Dasypodid fossils are very scarce, \nconsisting of only seven osteoderms attributed to Propraopus \n\nFigure 4. Fossils of terrestrial mammals.

The identified \ngenera include Glyptodon Owen, 1845 (501 specimens), \nPanochthus Burmeister, 1872 (44), Doedicurus Burmeister, \n1874 (23) and Neuryurus Ameghino, 1889 (8). Identification \nof the latter, which have osteoderms with irregular surface \nand without distinct textures (Zurita et al., 2006) is sometimes \ndubious, because abrasion can obliterate the fine-scale textures \non osteoderms of Panochthus making them look like Neuryurus. \nSome specimens of Glyptodon and Panochthus are represented \nby two or more fused osteoderms. Besides osteoderms, the only \nidentified glyptodontid remains are two teeth fragments and \n\n\n\nREVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 15(1), 201262\n\nAmeghino, 1881, plus three others that could not be identified.\nRemains of pilose xenarthrans include members of the \n\nMylodontidae (131 specimens) and Megatheriidae (44). \nMylodontid sloths are represented by Glossotherium Gervais, \n1855 (22 specimens), Lestodon Gervais, 1855 (14), Mylodon \nOwen, 1839 (11) and Catonyx Ameghino, 1891 (5), as well as \n83 unidentified specimens. The most conspicuous fossils of this \ngroup are isolated teeth, which are difficult to identify because \nof the similar morphology of the first molariform teeth. In \nCatonyx, the teeth have a subtriangular transverse profile distinct \nfrom those of the mylodontines. Other features that allowed \ndistinguishing between some genera are the morphology of the \ndistal portion of the tibia and the astragalus (Kraglievich, 1934). \nThe megatheriid sloths were identified by teeth (38 specimens) \nand one ungual phalange. Although Megatherium Cuvier, 1796 \nis the only megatheriid cited for the deposits of the CPRS, the \ngenus Eremotherium Spillmann, 1948, previously recorded from \nother areas of Rio Grande do Sul (Toledo, 1986; Oliveira et al., \n\n2002), was recently identified in the CPRS from deposits of Chu\u00ed \nCreek (Pereira et al., 2010), so it is possible that this genus may \nalso be present among the remains from the continental shelf. \n\nAmong the Toxodontidae, the only genus recognized for Rio \nGrande do Sul is Toxodon Owen, 1838, although a Toxodontidae \nindet. was recognized the continental shelf by a distal portion of \na femur (Paula Couto, 1944; Cunha, 1959) and Oliveira (1992) \nmentioned the presence of the genus Trigodon Ameghino, \n1887 on the basis a fragmentary tooth from the continental \nshelf. Toxodon was identified in the present analysis by 189 \nteeth, 15 long bones, 3 skull fragments and 1 astragalus (Figure \n7A). Litopterns are rare in the fossil deposits of Rio Grande \ndo Sul (Scherer et al., 2009). The macraucheniid litopterns are \nrepresented by two fragmentary teeth and a cervical vertebra of \nMacrauchenia Owen, 1838 (Figure 7B), while protherotheriids \nare represented by a single astragalus, attributed to Neolicaphrium \nFrenguelli, 1921 (Figure 7C).\n\nThe Gomphotheriids found in the CPRS are represented by \nthe genus Stegomastodon Pohlig, 1912 according to Marcon \n(2007). Fossils of this taxon are mostly teeth (62 specimens), but \ntwo fragments of dentaries and one tibia were also identified. \nThe teeth include both molar and incisors, mostly fragmented \n(Figures 7D, E). The most common equid remains are teeth \n(Figure 7F), although two metatarsals were also identified in \nthe collection. A detailed revision of this material is needed, \nbecause the abrasion and fragmentary condition of most of \nthe teeth make it difficult to assign them to a specific genus. \nHowever, the identified specimens belong to Equus Linnaeus, \n1758 and Hippidion Owen, 1869, previously identified among \nthe material from the continental shelf (Cunha, 1959) and from \nChu\u00ed Creek (Pereira et al., 2010). The only carnivore specimen \nin the collection is a left astragalus of Smilodon Lund, 1842 \n(Lopes &amp; Buchmann, 2010).\n\nFigure 5. Relative percentages of the taxonomic groups.

Considering that the fossil assemblage from the \ncontinental shelf contains remains that encompass a time span \nof some 700 ky BP (Lopes et al., 2010), reworked and mixed \ntogether by the late Pleistocene-early Holocene sea-level \noscillations, such variations cannot be attributed only to intrinsic \naspects of the paleocommunities. The abundance of glyptodontids \namong the specimens is a combination of the large number of \nosteoderms (up to 2000) in the carapace of an individual, plus \nthe small size and compact shape of the osteoderms, which \ncause them to be easily transported by waves and currents. \nAmong the glyptodontid specimens, however, the predominance \nof Glyptodon over other genera probably reflects the original \ndiversity pattern among these taxa. Given the similar shape and \ndimensions of the carapace osteoderms found in these taxa, which \nresults in similar preservation and transport potentials, one should \nexpect to find similar proportions among these genera; however, \nthe marked differences suggest a greater relative abundance of \nGlyptodon over the other genera in the paleoecosystems of the \nCPRS. A similar pattern is found among glyptodontid remains \nfrom Chu\u00ed Creek, which seem to represent a shorter time interval. \n\nPilose xenarthrans also present differences in relative \nabundance, with megatheriids less abundant that mylodontids. \nAmong the latter, the mylodontines, represented by Glossotherium, \nLestodon and Mylodon are more abundant than scelidotheriines, \nrepresented solely by Catonyx according to Lopes &amp; Pereira \n(2010). Gaudin (2004) stated that the low representativity of \nscelidotheriines in Pleistocene fossil assemblages is a product \nof the low taxonomic diversity of this group. \n\nThe record of carnivores is also very scarce, possibly \nreflecting the low specific richness of this group in South America \n(Prevosti &amp; Vizca\u00edno, 2006). Ecological factors may also be \nresponsible for the low representativity of large-bodied taxa such \nas Tapirus and Macrauchenia. The abundance of large mammals \nthat presumably inhabited open grassland environments such \nas ground sloths, mastodonts and glyptodonts (Oliveira, 1999) \nindicates that the Pleistocene environments of the CPRS were \nmostly open environments, which would not be suitable for \nthe forest-dwelling Tapirus. Although its remains can be found \nfrom Bolivia to Chile (Scherer et al., 2009), it is not clear why \nMacrauchenia is so scarce in the coastal area of Rio Grande do \nSul. Given that this taxon had low-crowned teeth, it is possible \nthat it could feed only on trees and shrubs with soft leaves, \ninstead of the abrasive grasses found in grassland environments. \nA detailed review on the teeth and postcranial specimens of \nartiodactyls from the CPRS is necessary in order to evaluate the \nrelative proportion between camelids and cervids.\n\nOther factors to be considered regarding the representativity \nof the fossils involve taphonomy, mostly the selection by \ntransport and mechanical destruction of the fossils by waves. \nThe fossils are preserved in biodetrital accumulations on the \ncontinental shelf until their removal and transportation to the \nbeach by storm waves (Buchmann, 2002; Lopes &amp; Buchmann, \n2010). This process seems to be the main one responsible for \nthe low proportion of large cranial and postcranial remains of \nlarge-bodied taxa such as sloths, toxodontids and gomphotheriids. \nWhile smaller, more compact remains of small-bodied taxa are \n\neasily transported by waves under normal conditions, the larger \nelements can be transported only by high energy waves, which \noccur only during extreme storms (Calliari et al., 1998; Lopes \net al., 2006). Thus, these large remains rarely come to the beach, \nbut once deposited there, would be removed only by a similar \nstorm, so their residence time on the beach is longer than that \nof a small fossil continuously moved by normal wave regimes. \n\nGiven that the selective transportation results in relatively few \nlarge skeletal elements of large-bodied taxa being deposited on \nthe beach, one could expect to find a relatively larger proportion \nof fossils of smaller-bodied taxa. However, the continuous \ntransportation and reworking in the surf zone by wave action even \nunder normal meteorological conditions results in a higher degree \nof abrasion, fragmentation and finally destruction of these remains. \nEven more massive skeletal remains are mostly fragmented \nand abraded; smaller and more compact-shaped elements are \ncomplete but most exhibit a high degree of abrasion due to their \nhigher transportation potential (Lopes et al., 2008). This process \nexplains the abundance of podials of artiodactyls. The abundance \nof osteoderms of glyptodonts and pampatheriids is a combination \nof the large proportion of these elements from a single individual \nand the higher transportability of these elements. The osteoderms \nof smaller cingulates, such as dasypodids, are more prone to \nmechanical destruction and abrasion in comparison to osteoderms \nof glyptodonts and pampatheriids, thus are less abundant. \n\nThe higher mechanical resistance of teeth, even those of the \nxenarthrans that do not bear enamel, contributes to the large \nproportion of such remains. The abrasion and destruction of most \nof the fossils is not just a product of present day marine dynamics, \nbut can also be attributed to past sea-level transgressions. \nDillenburg (1994) demonstrated that a marine transgression \ncould erode the upper 10 m of the continental shelf, which would \nalso affect the fossil remains preserved in this area. Past fluvial \ndynamics could also promote mechanical alteration on these \nfossils; studies have shown that during sea-level low stands \nseveral fluvial channels existed on the exposed portions of the \nshelf (Weschenfelder et al., 2008; Silva, 2009), thus these rivers \ncould also have transported and destroyed the fossil remains.\n\nThe fossil assemblage of the continental shelf represents a \ntime interval that encompasses at least the last 700 ky BP, which \nwas marked by glacioeustatic oscillations. These oscillations \nreworked and mixed together remains of distinct ages, creating \na large parautochthonous assemblage that represents a large \ntime-averaging interval (Lopes et al., 2010). This mixing \nis responsible for the co-occurrence of non-analogous taxa \n(sensu Lundelius, 1989), such as organisms that inhabit open, \nsemiarid environments (Dolichotinae, Reithrodon), together with \nothers that indicate forested (Tapirus) and permanently humid \n(Myocastor, Hydrochoerus) environments. Alternatively, this \nmixing could be related to the existence in the Pleistocene of \nenvironmental conditions not found in modern ecosystems. A \nsimilar pattern is observed in fossil assemblages from continental \ndeposits of the Sopas Formation of Uruguay (Ubilla, 2004) and \nChu\u00ed Creek, although in the latter the mixing could be in fact the \nresult of time-averaging and erosive processes (Lopes, in press).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAlthough the fossil assemblage from the southern Brazilian \ncontinental shelf does not represent a single paleocommunity \nor paleoecosystem, and encompasses remains of different ages, \n\n\n\n65AIRES &amp; LOPES  \u2013  QUATERNARY MAMMALS FROM SOUTHERN BRAZIL\n\nthe analysis of the skeletal remains revealed that the taxonomic \nrepresentativity of this assemblage seems to be influenced by a \ncombination of ecological and taphonomic factors. The relative \nabundance among glyptodontid taxa from this assemblage \nprobably reflects the original taxonomic abundance within this \ngroup, with Glyptodon being more diverse and abundant than \nother glyptodontids. The low ecological diversity explains the \nscarcity of fossils of carnivores and scelidotheriine sloths. The \nrelative absence of other taxa such as Macrauchenia and Tapirus \nseems to be related to ecological factors, given that remains \nof these large-bodied taxa would not be as much affected by \ntaphonomic factors as the small-bodied taxa. This question \ncould be resolved with detailed paleoecological studies and \ncomparison with other geographically and temporally close \nfossil assemblages.\n\nTaphonomic factors affect the relative proportions of taxa \nby selective transportation and destruction of the smaller and/or \ncompact-shaped remains. Once removed from the deposits on the \nshelf, these remains are continuously moved and transported by \nwaves that promote their abrasion and destruction; this process \nwould be a major reason for the relative absence of small organisms \nsuch as rodents and proterotheriids. Larger elements, on the other \nhand, are removed and transported to the beach only on rare \noccasions when extreme storm waves affect the deposits. \n\nThe high proportion of osteoderms of glyptodontids and \npampatheriids results from a combination of the large number \nof these elements on a single individual, plus their higher \ntransportation potential due to their small size and compact \nshape. The lower proportion of the smaller osteoderms of \ndasypodids, however, is likely to be a result of mechanical \nfragmentation and abrasion.\n\nThe results presented here are partially hampered by the \nabrasion and fragmentation of most of the specimens, and \nalso by the lack of a detailed revision of certain groups (e.g. \nMylodontidae, Equidae). A careful taxonomic analysis shall \nimprove the taxonomic resolution of the material and improve \nthe estimates of diversity of those groups.\n\nAlthough it cannot be considered as representing a \npaleocommunity or paleoenvironment, given the large time-\naveraging of the remains, further research on continental fossil \nlocalities of more restricted age should provide additional \ninformation regarding the Pleistocene mammalian communities \nand a means for paleoecological comparisons with the \nassemblage from the continental shelf. This study also reinforces \nthe importance of evaluating the taphonomic processes that affect \nfossil assemblages when using fossil remains for reconstructing \npaleoenvironments and paleocommunities.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors express their gratitude to L.
