Since the wild harvest of these organisms is neither \n\nsustainable nor practicable, the aquaculture presents itself as the most promising solution. \n\nEx situ coral farming aside from enabling for a greater production control, allows for the \n\nselection of colonies with more desirable characteristics and, the possibility of asexual \n\nreproduction through fragmentation, preserving these same genetic characteristics and \n\npossibly the same associated endosymbionts. The control of fixation and cicatrization, \n\npost-fragmentation, is crucial for the optimization of production, by decreasing the \n\nsurvival. The present study aimed at evaluate for the first time, through five consecutive \n\nexperiments, the effect of: i) spectra \u2013 white, blue and red light, ii) Photosynthetic Active \n\nRadiation (PAR) intensity - 60 e 120 \u00b5mol quanta/m2/s, iii) substrate \u2013 calcium carbonate \n\nand plastic, iv) fixation process \u2013 ethyl cyanoacrylate glue, N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue \n\nand rubber band, e v) fragment position \u2013 intact tissue and cutted tissue in contact with \n\nthe fixation substrate. The tested factors were evaluated based on: i) survival percentage, \n\nii) photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), and iii) fixation force (Newton/mm\n2). PAR intensity \n\nof 120 \u00b5mol quanta/m2/s and red light spectrum were the overall best light related \n\ntreatments. Substrate type and fragment position were found not to affect the fragment \n\nsurvival and fixation force of the fragments. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue was the most \n\neffective fixation process. This study highlights the importance of the post-fragmentation \n\ntechniques in determining the success of coral aquaculture. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Aquaculture; Coral; Fragmentation; Sarcophyton sp.; Survival; \n\nFixation force; PAM fluorometry. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nTable of Contents \n \n\n1.

Annexes \n\n \n\n\n\n1 \n \n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n1.1 Biology and ecology of corals \n\n \n\nCorals, being such vital organisms of coral reefs, have long been subject to several \n\nbiological studies (McFadden et al., 2006b; Osinga et al., 2011). Most coral species live \n\nin compact colonies formed by several polyps, which in turn are formed by two epithelial \n\ncell layers, the epidermis (or ectoderm) and the gastrodermis (or endoderm), and by an \n\noral end surrounded by tentacles (Rocha, 2013). The majority of tropical coral species \n\nestablish a mutualistic symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus \n\nSymbiodinium, commonly known as zooxanthellae (Glynn, 1996), that live inside \n\nspecialized cells in the coral endoderm. Through this symbiosis, coral provides shelter \n\nand nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, while it receives sugars, fatty acids \n\nand amino acids produced photosynthetically by the zooxanthellae (Ellis and Sharron, \n\n1997; Glynn, 1996).  In recent studies, zooxanthellae were found to belong to eight broad \n\nclades (clade A to clade H) (Coffroth and Santos, 2005; Stat et al., 2006). The symbiosis \n\nestablished between different corals and specific clades of zooxanthellae are mostly \n\nhabitat-specific, affecting corals distribution and response to extreme environmental \n\nconditions, with corals exhibiting a depth/light relationship with their zooxanthellae \n\n(depth zonation)(Baker and Rowan, 1997; Mass et al., 2010; Robison and Warner, 2006; \n\nRowan and Knowlton, 1995; Ziegler et al., 2015). Zooxanthellate-coral holobiont (coral \n\nhost and associated endosymbionts) can regulate its photosynthetic potential according to \n\nthe prevailing environmental conditions in such a way that photosynthesis is always \n\noptimal for growth (photoacclimation), under a broad range of photon flux densities. They \n\ndo so by adjusting zooxanthellae density, pigment density (Titlyanov et al., 2001),  or the \n\npigment composition based on the available light spectra (Dustan, 1982). \n\nCorals are commonly divided in hard and soft corals, being the distinction based \n\nmainly in the presence or absence of a calcium carbonate skeleton to support the colony \n\n(Rocha, 2013). Hard corals, or scleractinian corals, being the main builders of coral reefs, \n\nplay an important role in the ecology of these ecosystems. Soft corals have also a leading \n\nrole as structural components and contributors to the biomass of the coral reef. Soft corals \n\noften equal or exceed scleractinian corals in reef total coverage (McFadden et al., 2006b; \n\nOsinga et al., 2011). As sessile organisms, corals have developed several defense \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nmechanisms to ensure their survival, and from these mechanisms, chemical interactions \n\nplay a vital role (Sammarco and Coll, 1992). Coral tissues, skeleton and mucus layer \n\ncontains dense and diverse populations of bacteria and archaea that provide support, \n\nnutrition and protection against pathogens (Bythell and Wild, 2011; Chen et al., 2012; \n\nRocha et al., 2011; Sharon and Rosenberg, 2008). The production of secondary \n\nmetabolites  acts as an obstacle to predation, competition (Hay, 1996a; Raveendran and \n\nMol, 2009; Sammarco et al., 1985) and have displayed diverse bioactivities, promising \n\nfor drug development (e.g., cytotoxicity, antibiotic and anticancer activity) (Dobretsov et \n\nal., 2015; Rocha et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n1.2 Ecological and socio-economic importance of coral reefs \n\n \n\nCoral reefs represent an epicenter of global marine biodiversity and are ranked \n\namong the most productive and complex ecosystems (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). They act \n\nas home and nursery grounds for many marine species, protect coastlines, and provide \n\nfood sources and income to people living along coastlines (Burke et al., 2011; Osinga et \n\nal., 2011; Van Zanten et al., 2014). It is estimated that about 10% of the world\u2019s \n\npopulation depend on coral reefs, directly or indirectly, either as a source of food, natural \n\nproducts or as a tourism attraction (Osinga et al., 2011).  \n\nDespite their ecological and economic importance, ecological role and ecosystem \n\nservices, approximately 75% of coral reefs worldwide are currently threatened by a \n\ncombination of stressors that act locally or globally (Burke et al., 2011; Dudgeon et al., \n\n2010). Threats like climate change (Burke et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2002), pollution \n\n(Ross and Hallock, 2014), the use of destructive fishing practices (e.g. dynamite or \n\ncyanide) (Burke et al., 2011; Calado, 2006; Hodgson, 1999; McClanahan et al., 1996; \n\nOlivotto et al., 2003), the intensive recreational tourism (Lamb et al., 2014), collection of \n\ncorals for the extraction  of natural products (Faulkner, 2001; Leal et al., 2012; Rocha et \n\nal., 2011; Thakur et al., 2005) or for the marine aquarium trade  (Tlusty, 2002; Wabnitz \n\net al., 2003). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n1.3 Economic importance of corals  \n\n \n\n1.3.1 Bioprospection of marine natural products \n\n \n\nCorals alongside other marine invertebrates have long been arousing interest as \n\nsource of prototype molecules with cosmetic and pharmaceutical value (Blunt et al., 2005; \n\nGrosso et al., 2014; Haefner, 2003; Leal et al., 2012; Rocha et al., 2011; Sipkema et al., \n\n2005; Vignesh et al., 2011). About 40 years ago the first marine compounds were \n\ndescribed in published reports, since then the discovery of bioactive compounds has \n\nprogressed at a booming rate (Mendola, 2003). By 2011 around 3000 new natural \n\nproducts had been extracted exclusively from corals (Rocha et al., 2011). Nowadays, the \n\nscreen for new natural products is still largely dependent on the harvest of wild specimens. \n\nThis is a major constraint for the development of new marine drugs, due to two main \n\nbottlenecks, sustainability and replicability (Montaser and Luesch, 2012). Sustainability \n\nsince  most marine natural compounds are mainly secondary metabolites, as such, their \n\nyields are very low on a wet-weight basis, requiring impracticable amounts of harvested \n\nbiomass material to produce sufficient quantities of a given compound (Mendola, 2003). \n\nReplicability is hindered in wild harvesting by the environmental variability and \n\ncommunity level changes to the chemical ecology of the target organisms, meaning that \n\nthe chemical composition of individuals of the same species may vary spatial and \n\ntemporally and therefore may not assure the supply of the target metabolite (Hay, 1996b).  \n\n \n\n1.3.2 Corals in the marine ornamental trade \n\n \n\nCorals exhibit many shapes and colors making them desirable to display in captive \n\nreef systems. Their popularity promotes an ever growing demand for reef specimens, \n\nincluding both hard and soft corals, the majority of which are collected, sometimes \n\nunrelenting, form the wild. (Ellis, 1999; Green and Shirley, 1999).  \n\nIt is estimated that nearly 80% of all traded corals along with other reef organisms, \n\ncollected from the ocean to the ornamental trade die, directly or indirectly, during capture, \n\nshipment, handling due to destructive fishing practices, poor handling and diseases \n\n(Rhyne et al., 2014; Wabnitz et al., 2003; Wood, 2001). The ornamental trade brought a \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nnew and much needed source of income to coastal communities of the Indo-Pacific and \n\nimproved access to coral reef organisms for the purpose of research and education \n\n(Tlusty, 2002; Tlusty et al., 2013) but, it also increased the use of destructive fishing \n\npractices, impacts on rare population and endemic species and the introduction of invasive \n\nspecies in foreign habitats (Calado, 2006; Gertzen et al., 2008; Olivotto et al., 2003; \n\nTlusty, 2002).  \n\n \n\n1.3.3 Coral reefs restoration \n\n \n\nIn the face of severe degradation of reefs, active coral transplantation measures \n\nhave become more regularly employed and recognized as a key management tool for \n\nrehabilitation of coral reefs, a practice meant to replace dead coral colonies and accelerate \n\nthe reef natural recovery (Ammar, 2009; Chavanich et al., 2015; Epstein et al., 2003, \n\n2001). This practice involves the transplantation of whole coral colonies, coral fragments \n\nor seeding by planula larvae (Okamoto et al., 2012; Rinkevich, 2005; Yap, 2004). Various \n\nmethodologies have been suggested, including the construction of in situ or ex situ \n\nnurseries to grow large numbers of coral fragments. Nursery-grown fragments are then \n\ntransplanted to degrade reef sites (Epstein et al., 2001; Okamoto et al., 2012; Rinkevich, \n\n2005; Shafir et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\n1.4 State of the art of coral aquaculture \n\n \n\nThe extraction of bio-active compounds with bio-medical applications (Carlson, \n\n1999; Leal et al., 2013; Rocha et al., 2011), the ornamental aquarium trade (Olivotto et \n\nal., 2011; Tlusty, 2002; Wabnitz et al., 2003), and the coral reef restoration  (Bongiorni \n\net al., 2011; Epstein et al., 2001; Shafir et al., 2006; Soong and Chen, 2003; Yap and \n\nMolina, 2003; Yap, 2000) have been increasing the demand for these organisms, leading \n\nto their massive harvesting (Castanaro and Lasker, 2003). Researchers, collectors and \n\nhobbyists began a worldwide effort in order to address the mitigation of the negative \n\nimpacts caused by the harvest of these organisms from the wild (Castanaro and Lasker, \n\n2003; Wood, 2001) and therefore establish a sustainable approach to supply the coral \n\ndemand (Wood, 2001). They began to focus on optimizing culture techniques to \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nmaximize coral survival and growth, and reduce the associated production costs, \n\ncontributing to the economic feasibility of coral aquaculture and offset wild specimens \n\ncollection  (Carlson, 1999; Ellis and Ellis, 2002; Ellis and Sharron, 1997; Fox et al., 2005; \n\nLeal et al., 2013; Mendola, 2003; Parks et al., 2003; Pomeroy et al., 2006; Rocha, 2013; \n\nSella and Benayahu, 2010; Soong and Chen, 2003). \n\nCoral aquaculture can be performed in situ or ex situ. Despite the low associated \n\nexpenses, in situ aquaculture can make corals vulnerable to pathogens, predators and \n\ncompetitors (Rinkevich, 2005; Rocha et al., 2013b). On the other hand,  ex situ production \n\ninvolves higher start-up and production costs, but allows for a better production control \n\nof the biotic and abiotic parameters affecting coral growth (Borneman and Loivrie, 2001; \n\nForsman et al., 2006; Yap and Molina, 2003). Coral biomass can be continuously \n\nproduced using homogenous environmental conditions, which is especially important for \n\nthe purpose of extraction of natural products (Leal et al., 2013). As coral aquaculture in \n\nclosed artificial seawater systems is being more commonly implemented, the process is \n\nbecoming increasingly more simple and cost effective (Borneman and Loivrie, 2001; \n\nOsinga et al., 2011). \n\nCoral aquaculture is a practice centered on the ability of corals to reproduce \n\nasexually by fragmentation (Borneman and Loivrie, 2001; Delbeek, 2001; Ellis and Ellis, \n\n2002; Ellis, 1999; Highsmith, 1982; Sella and Benayahu, 2010). The asexual propagation \n\nof hard and soft corals through fragmentation dates back to the 1960s (Delbeek, 2001), \n\nsince then this simple and inexpensive method has been commonly used by researchers \n\nand aquarium hobbyists, for the mass production of corals, where it is possible to \n\nfragment a mother colony into several clones (Forsman et al., 2006; Rocha et al., 2013c; \n\nSella and Benayahu, 2010).  Wild-collected or captive-grown colonies are used for the \n\nproduction of fragments. The latter are usually attached or glued by various processes \n\nuntil natural attachment is achieved (Delbeek, 2001). Fragmentation enables the biomass \n\nof a genotype to increase beyond the mechanical limit of an individual colony (Hughes et \n\nal, 1992), and helps maintain high growth rates (Hughes and Jackson, 1985), while \n\ndisplaying high survival rates of the frags and reduced impact on donor colonies (e.g. Fox \n\net al, 2005), presenting therefore as a crucial step in most of coral production systems. \n\nFragmentation can also produce large sample sizes with minimal genetic variation, which \n\ncan be an advantage for some experimental designs (Shafir et al., 2003). \n\nFor the success of zooxanthellate coral aquaculture it is important to consider \n\nmultiple and interacting factors, such as light, water flow, genotype, temperature, \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\ninorganic nutrients, fixation substrate or the fragmentation protocol (Ferse, 2010; Osinga \n\net al., 2011; Rocha et al., 2013a,b,c ; Sella and Benayahu, 2010). Therefore, multifactorial \n\nculture experiments are desired, not only to maximize the productivity, but also to further \n\nunfold the interactions between potentially influential factors.  \n\nLight, undoubtedly, plays a vital role in the growth of zooxanthellate corals. The \n\nefficiency of the photoautotrophic processes in these symbionts is largely affected by the \n\nlight intensity and spectral quality (Al-Horani et al., 2003; Khalesi et al., 2009; Osinga et \n\nal., 2008; Rocha et al., 2013a,c ; Wijgerde et al., 2014, 2012) and, can affect their \n\ncontribution to coral growth, metabolism (Apprill et al., 2007; Fitt and Cook, 2001; \n\nMarubini et al., 2001; Reynaud et al., 2004; Schlacher et al., 2007), physiology and \n\nsurvival (Venn et al., 2008). Light-related growth limitations are commonly caused by \n\nlow internal pH due to low photosynthesis (Schneider and Erez, 2006), insufficient \n\nproduction (Titlyanov et al., 2001) or translocation of photosynthates (Marubini and \n\nDavies, 1996). However, corals exposed to high irradiance levels can also experience \n\nphotoinhibition, which also translates in retarded growth (Iglesias-Prieto et al., 1992).  \n\nCorals also require a solid and stable substrate for attachment and, safe and \n\nreliable \u201cgluing\u201d materials. In culture production, raising the corals off the bottom of the \n\ntank with small substrate blocks can reduce smothering. Several substrate types have been \n\nused as anchor material, including: plastic florist vials, scleractinian coral skeleton \n\n(aragonite), epoxy putties, ceramic tiles, fabricated blocks with sand, shell or aragonite, \n\nas well as fabricated plastic stands (Boch and Morse, 2012; Borneman and Loivrie, 2001; \n\nEllis and Ellis, 2002; Ellis and Sharron, 1997; Forsman et al., 2006; Sella and Benayahu, \n\n2010; Tortolero-Langarica et al., 2014; Yap, 2004). As fixation methods, farmers and \n\nhobbyists commonly use rubber bands for its cost-effectiveness (Rocha et al., 2013a), \n\ncyanoacrylate glues for the immediate and strong bond they form (Bongiorni et al., 2011; \n\nEllis and Sharron, 1997) and, more recently, n-butyl-2-cianoacrylate, which is used in \n\nseveral medical procedures  due to its lower toxicity ( Kumar and  Priyayadav, 2010).  \n\nAfter fragmentation, coral fragments are more prone to necrosis and bacterial \n\ninfection, which can result in death. The way in which a coral is cutted can have a \n\nsignificant effect on the survival of the fragment (Ellis and Sharron, 1997). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n1.5 Sarcophyton sp. \n\n \n\nThe species of the genus Sarcophyton (Cnidaria: Anthozoa: Octocorallia: \n\nAlcyonacea) are ecologically important members of shallow reef communities in the \n\nIndo-West Pacific and Red Sea region, often found in high energy areas such as surge \n\nzones and tide pools, but also occurring in deeper water. (Ellis, 1999; McFadden et al., \n\n2006a). The incomplete knowledge regarding Sarcophyton sp.  taxonomy, caused by the \n\nexistence of few diagnostic morphological features and by the historical lack of \n\ntaxonomic work done on this genus, hinders their precise identification (McFadden et al., \n\n2006a).  Sarcophyton sp. has long been known to be a problematic taxon, as recognized \n\nby Verseveldt (1982): \u2018\u2018Many investigators already pointed out the great variability found \n\nin this species, especially with respect to shape and size of the colony, and shape and \n\ndimensions of the coenenchymal sclerites in the stalk\u201d. It is however a remarkably \n\nresilient genus, characterized by a distinctive bulky stalk, a mushroom shaped top called \n\na capitulum, and by their sclerites shape, which are found in the interior coenenchymal \n\ntissue of the colony (Aratake et al., 2012). The hardiness displayed by Sarcophyton sp. \n\nenhances their potential as farmed coral, because they are able to survive handling stress \n\nduring fragmentation and shipping.  \n\nThis genera is known to have many secondary metabolites, like sarcophytoxide \n\n(allelopatic), which are toxic and used by corals in competition for space, or as a strategy \n\nto inhibit growth and survival of their neighbors (Elahwany et al., 2013; Fleury et al., \n\n2004; Lages et al., 2006; Maida et al., 1995; Sammarco and Coll, 1992). They have been \n\nhighly surveyed for their natural products, especially cembrane diterpenes and \n\nsesquiterpenes (antitumor activities) and are among the most popular and valued \n\norganisms in the marine aquarium trade and have (Badria et al., 1998; McFadden et al., \n\n2006a; Rocha et al., 2011; Rocha, 2013). For these reasons, Sarcophyton species make \n\ngood candidates for commercial production. \n\n \n\n1.6 Objectives \n\n \n\nIn this project proposed to optimize the ex situ coral production with emphasis on \n\nthe factors affecting the success of the fragmentation process in Sarcophyton sp.. With \n\nthat mindset several consecutive culture experiments were developed, some \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nmultifactorial, to evaluate the effect of these factors and, the possible interactions between \n\nthem. We studied three different light spectra (white, blue and red), two PAR \n\n(Photosynthetically Active Radiation) intensities (120 and 60 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1), two \n\ndifferent substrates (plastic stands and calcium carbonate disks), three fixation techniques \n\n(rubber band, ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue), N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl)), \n\ntwo fragment positions (cut and intact side facing down) and, the interactions between \n\nthem. Survival, fixation ratio, fixation force and photosynthetic efficiency were evaluated \n\nat the end of each experiment.  \n\n \n\n2. Material and Methods \n\n \n\nThe species employed in this study will be termed Sarcophyton sp., since recent \n\nstudies have revealed a complex and incomplete taxonomy in this genus (Aratake et al., \n\n2012).  \n\n \n\n2.1 Coral Husbandry \n\n \n\nA total of eighteen colonies of the soft coral Sarcophyton sp. (Figure 1), collected \n\nin Sumbawa, Indonesia, approximately between 5 and 15 m depth, were purchased from \n\na marine aquarium wholesaler and transported to the laboratory facilities. \n\nThe colonies were stocked in our laboratory culture system for a period of 14 days, \n\nwith a photoperiod of 12L: 12D, to acclimatize to the experimental conditions (light \n\nregime, water parameters and circulation) and to detect the eventual presence of diseases \n\nor parasitical infections.  \n\nFollowing the 14 days of acclimatization to water parameter and without any \n\nevidence of infection or disease, the colonies were prepared for fragmentation.  \n\n \n\n2.2 Fragmentation \n\n \n\nFragmentation was performed with a sterilized scalpel, latex gloves and a mask, \n\nin a board containing water from the experimental system, to discard all the mucus \n\nreleased by fragmentation. The capitulum of each mother colonies was fractionated, \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nproducing fragments of similar size (approximately 1-2 cm2). After fragmentation, each \n\ncoral fragment was attached to the respective labeled stand (Figure 2). The remaining \n\ncolonies were kept in our laboratory system.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Sarcophyton sp. colony during acclimatization to experimental \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Step-by-step of the fragmentation process. a) Cutting the mother \n\ncolony\u2019s capitulum; b) Fragmentation of the capitulum into several fragments (1-2cm); \n\na b c \n\ne d f \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nc) and d) attachment of the fragments to their respective labeled stand; e) placement of \n\nthe stands onto the platform, and f) Coral fragment in the culture system after \n\ncicatrization. \n\n \n\n2.3 Experiment 1 (Light spectra) \n\n \n\nThe spectral quality of light is assumed to be a parameter of outmost importance in \n\nany ex situ coral production, nonetheless, few studies have ever addressed this question \n\n(Rocha et al., 2013b; Wijgerde et al., 2014, 2012). Therefore in this experiment, the effect \n\nof three different light spectra (blue, white and red) on the post-fragmentation success of \n\nSarcophyton sp. was studied. \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Experimental culture system (1) \n\n \n\nThe system (Figure 3) was composed by three glass tanks (65L of water volume, \n\n0.50m L x 0.45 W x 0.31m H), both connected to a sump tank (145L of water volume, \n\n1m L x 0.45m W x 0.37m H). Each tank was equipped with a circulation pump (SICCE \n\nvoyager nano, SICCE, Vicenza, Italy), which provided a water flow of, approximately, \n\n2000 L h?1. The sump was equipped with one protein skimmer (TMC V2Skim 1000, \n\nBristol, UK), a biologic filter (composed of about 10L bio-balls), two submersible heaters \n\n(one Eheim J\u00e4ger 300W, Deizisau, Germany, and a SERA 200W, Heinsberg \n\nGermany), a UV filter (SUNSUN CUV-207 7W, Zhejiang, China) and one recirculation \n\npump (Eheim 1262, Deizisau, Germany) to provide a water flow of, approximately, 1200 \n\nL h?1 to the coral tanks. The white light tank was illuminated by two T5 fluorescent lamps \n\nArcadia 24 W Marine White (Red Hill, UK), the red light tank by two T5 fluorescent \n\nlamps Aqualine 24 W Plant Grow (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany) and the blue light \n\ntank by two T5 fluorescent lamps REEF-SPEC\u2122 24 W Actinic (Red Sea, France) of 24 \n\nW (Figure 4), with a photoperiod of 12L: 12D. The experimental system operated with \n\nsynthetic saltwater (prepared by mixing Tropic Marin Pro Reef salt \u2013 Tropic Marine, \n\nWartenberg, Germany \u2013 with water purified by reverse osmosis). Salinity was maintained \n\nat 35 through the daily addition of fresh water purified by a reverse osmosis system \n\n(Aqua-win RO-6080, Kaohsiung, Thailand). \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n2.3.2 Experimental design \n\n \n\nAfter the 14 days of acclimatization three mother colonies were fragmented (see \n\n2.2 Fragmentation) to produce 20 fragments each, in a total of 60 fragments.  The \n\nfragments were illuminated by a PAR intensity of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 and were \n\nsecured with rubber bands to labeled plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle\u00ae, Bristol, UK) \n\n(Figure 6.b), as described by Rocha (2013). The fragments were distributed among the 3 \n\ntanks of the experimental culture system, with each tank having a total of 20 fragments. \n\nEach mother colony contributed approximately equally to the number of fragments in \n\neach tank. This experiment ran for 60 days.  PAR value was measured with a Quantum \n\nFlux meter (Apogee MQ-200, Logan, Utah, USA) with a submergible sensor. \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Laboratorial analysis \n\n \n\nSeveral parameters were recorded:  the survival and fixation ratio (fragments \n\nfixed: fragments unfixed), the fixation force (see 2.8.1 Fixation force) at the end of the \n\nexperiment. \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Data analysis \n\n \n\nThe existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for \n\nSarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different light spectra, was tested using a \n\n?2 test. \n\nThe existence of significant differences among the fixation force recorded was \n\ntested using a one way ANOVA and a Tukey\u2019s HSD post-hoc test. Assumptions of \n\nnormality and homogeneity of variance were checked prior to the analysis through the \n\nShapiro-Wilks and Levene tests, respectively. Tukey\u2019s HSD test was used to determine \n\ndifferences between light treatments. Light spectra was used as the categorical factor to \n\nthe performed analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistica 12.0 \n\nsoftware. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Three-dimensional model of the experimental culture system (1), \n\ndepicting all the major features. \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Wavelength emission of: a) Red light spectra: Aqualine Plant Grow \n\n(Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany); b) White light spectra: Arcadia Marine White (Red \n\nHill, UK); c) Blue light spectra: REEF-SPEC\u2122 Actinic 22000K (Red Sea, France); and \n\nd) Action spectra of photosynthesis (in red), shown together with the estimated absorption \n\nspectra of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids (adapted from Lodish et al., 2000). \n\na) \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n2.4 Experiment 2 (Light spectra x PAR intensity) \n\n \n\n Light PAR intensity as a vital effect on coral photobiology, physiology and \n\ngrowth, as reviewed by Osinga et al. (2011). Furthermore, it represents one of the major \n\nexpenses in any ex situ coral production and, for that reason, we decided to use two light \n\nPAR intensities in our next experiment, a low light PAR of 60 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 and a \n\nhigh light PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1, similar to the study of Rocha et al. (2013a). \n\nSpectral quality was also included (blue and red spectra).  A multifactorial experiment \n\nwas set to study the effect of PAR intensity, spectra and their combined effect on the post-\n\nfragmentation success of Sarcophyton sp.. \n\n \n\n2.4.1 Experimental culture system (2) \n\n \n\nThe system (Figure 5) was composed by two glass tanks (218L of water volume, \n\n1.18m L x 0.43m W x 0.43m H), both connected to a sump tank (145L of water volume, \n\n1.18m L x 0.35m W x 0.55m H). Each tank was equipped with a circulation pump \n\n(Turbelle nanostream-6025 Tunze, Penzberg, Germany), which provide a water flow of, \n\napproximately, 2500 L h?1. The sump was equipped with two protein skimmers (APF-\n\n600 Deltec, Delmenhorst, Germany), a biologic filter (composed of about 10 kg of live \n\nrock and bio-balls), two chemical filter bag with activated carbon, two submersible \n\nheaters (Eheim J\u00e4ger 150W, Deizisau, Germany), a UV filter (V2ecton 400, TMC, Bristol, \n\nUK) and two recirculation pumps (Eheim 1260, Deizisau, Germany) to provide a water \n\nflow of, approximately, 1500 L h?1 to the coral tanks. The upper tank was illuminated by \n\nfour T5 lamps Aqualine Plant Grow (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany) of 54 W and, \n\nthe lower tank by four T5 REEF-SPEC\u2122 Actinic 22000K (Red Sea, France) of 54 W, \n\nproviding a PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 at the fragment level, under a photoperiod \n\nof 12L:12D. PAR value was measured with a Quantum Flux meter (Apogee MQ-200, \n\nLogan, Utah, USA) with a submergible sensor. The experimental system operates with \n\nartificial saltwater (Tropic Marine, Wartenberg, Germany)). Salinity was maintained at \n\n35 \u2030 through the use of an osmoregulator (Deltec Aquastat 1000, Delmenhorst, \n\nGermany) which automatically compensates the evaporated water, with fresh water \n\npurified by a reverse osmosis system (Aqua-win RO-6080, Kaohsiung, Thailand). \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n2.4.2 Experimental design \n\n \n\nAfter the 14 days of acclimatization, six mother colonies were fragmented (see \n\n2.2 Fragmentation), producing 24 fragments each. The fragments were secured with \n\nrubber bands to labeled plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle\u00ae, Bristol, UK) (Figure 6 b) \n\nand then divided equally by the 4 treatments, for a total of 144 fragments (6 frags x 6 \n\nmother colonies x 4 treatments). \n\nEach experimental tank had 72 fragments and, in each tank, half of the 72 \n\nfragments (n=36) were placed on a 10 cm high platform (depth at which they received a \n\nPAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1), and the other half were placed on the bottom of the \n\ntank (depth at which they received a PAR of 60 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1). PAR value was \n\nmeasured with a Quantum Flux meter (Apogee MQ-200, Logan, Utah, USA) with a \n\nsubmergible sensor.  This stage proceeded for 60 days. \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Laboratorial analysis \n\n \n\nThe survival and fixation ratio and the fixation force (see 2.2 Fixation force) and \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency (see 2.8.2 Photosynthetic efficiency) were recorded for each \n\nfragment at the end of the experiment. \n\n \n\n2.4.4 Data Analysis \n\n \n\nThe existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for \n\nSarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different treatments, was tested using a ?2 \n\ntest. \n\nThe existence of significant differences among the fixation force and maximum \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (PS II)(Fv/Fm) recorded was tested using a \n\nfactorial ANOVA and an Unequal N HSD post-hoc test.

The effect of a natural and \n\nrough substrate (calcium carbonate disks made from coral skeleton) versus a more flat \n\nand smooth artificial one (plastic stands, TMC Coral Cradle\u00ae, Bristol, UK), was tested, \n\nas described by Ellis &amp; Ellis (2002) and Rocha et al. (2013a) respectively. \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nFor this experiment  the spectra variable was kept, for which previous results were \n\ninconclusive and, therefore, stablished a multifactorial experiment to study the effect of \n\nsubstrate, spectra and their combined effect on post-fragmentation success of \n\nSarcophyton sp.. \n\n \n\n2.5.1 Experimental design \n\n \n\nFor this part of the experiment the same experimental conditions were used as in \n\nExperimental culture system 2, with the same light features and photoperiod.  \n\nAfter the 14 days of acclimatization three mother colonies were fragmented as \n\ndescribed before, producing 24 fragments each, which were then divided equally by the \n\n4 treatments (Red light x Plastic stand, Red light calcium carbonate stand, Blue light x \n\nPlastic stand, Blue light calcium carbonate stand), for a total of 72 fragments (6 frags x 3 \n\nmother colonies x 4 treatments). \n\nEach experimental tank had 72 fragments placed on a 10 cm high platform (depth \n\nat which they received a PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1) and, half of those 72 fragments \n\n(n=36) were attached with a rubber band to labeled calcium carbonate stands (Figure 6 \n\na), and the other half (n=36) fragments were attached to labeled plastic stands (TMC \n\nCoral Cradle\u00ae, Bristol, UK) (Figure 6b). PAR value was measured with a Quantum Flux \n\nmeter (Apogee MQ-200, Logan, Utah, USA) with a submergible sensor.  This stage \n\nproceeded for 60 days. \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Laboratorial Analysis \n\n \n\nThe survival and fixation ratio were recorded and, the fixation force (see 2.8.1 \n\nFixation force) and maximum photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (see 2.8.2 \n\nPhotosynthetic efficiency) of the fragments were analyzed at the end of the experiment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n2.5.3 Data Analysis \n\n \n\nThe existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for \n\nSarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different treatments, was tested using a ?2 \n\ntest. \n\nThe existence of significant differences among the fixation force and maximum \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) recorded was tested using a factorial \n\nANOVA and an Unequal N HSD post-hoc test. Assumptions of normality and \n\nhomogeneity of variance were checked prior to the analysis through the Shapiro-Wilks \n\nand Levene tests, respectively. Unequal N HSD test was used to determine differences \n\nbetween light spectra and substrate. Light spectra and substrate were used as the \n\ncategorical factor to the performed analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using \n\nthe Statistica 12.0 software. \n\n \n\n2.6 Experiment 4 (Fixation process x Light spectra) \n\n \n\n Several fixation processes have been employed in coral production studies, as \n\nreviewed by Ellis (1999). These methods however, have not been considered as to have \n\nan influence on post-fragmentation success. This experiment aimed to study the effect of \n\nthree different fixation processes (ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue), Rubber band, N-butyl-\n\n2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl)) and two light spectra (red and blue), and the possible \n\ninteraction between them on the post-fragmentation success. \n\n \n\n2.6.1 Experimental design \n\n \n\nFor this part of the experiment the experimental system applied was the same as \n\nfor the previous experiment (Experimental culture system 2 (Figure 5)), with the same \n\nlight features and photoperiod.  \n\nAfter the 14 days of acclimatization four mother colonies were fragmented (see \n\n2.2 Fragmentation technical description), producing 12 fragments each, which were then \n\ndivided equally by the 6 treatments, for a total of 72 fragments (3 frags x 4 mother \n\ncolonies x 6 treatments). In each tank, we had 12 fragments fixed with rubber bands, 12 \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nfixed with ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue (Henkel Ib\u00e9rica, Bobadela, Portugal)) and 12 \n\nfixed with n-butyl cyanoacrylate glue (B. Braun Histoacryl, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil). All \n\nthe fragments were secured to plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle\u00ae, Bristol, UK) (Figure \n\n6.b) and placed on 10 cm high platform (depth at which they received a PAR of 120 ?mol \n\nquanta m?2 s?1). This experiment lasted for 60 days. \n\n \n\n2.6.2 Laboratorial analysis \n\n \n\nThe survival and fixation ratio were recorded and, the fixation force (see 2.8.1 \n\nFixation force) and photosynthetic efficiency (see 2.8.2 Photosynthetic efficiency) of the \n\nfragments at the end of the experiment was analyzed. \n\n \n\n 2.6.3 Data Analysis \n\n \n\nThe existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for \n\nSarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different treatments, was tested using a ?2 \n\ntest. \n\nThe existence of significant differences among the fixation force and \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) recorded was tested using a factorial ANOVA and a \n\nTukey\u2019s HSD post-hoc test. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were \n\nchecked prior to the analysis through the Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests, respectively. \n\nTukeys\u2019s HSD test was used to determine differences between light spectra and fixation \n\nprocess. Light spectra and fixation process were used as the categorical factor to the \n\nperformed analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistica 12.0 \n\nsoftware. \n\n \n\n2.7 Experiment 5 (Fragment position) \n\n \n\nWith no studies found addressing the influence of fragment position (cut side or \n\nintact side facing down) a final experiment was performed to address this question. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Types of substrates for attachment of the coral fragments used in the \n\nexperiment. a) Aragonite (calcium carbonate) stands, made from scleractinian coral \n\nskeleton; b) plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle\u00ae, Bristol, UK). \n\n \n\n 2.7.1 Experimental design \n\n \n\nFor this part of the experiment the experimental system applied was the same as \n\nfor the previous experiment (Experimental culture system 2 (Figure 5)), with the same \n\nlight features and photoperiod.  \n\nUsing the last 2 colonies 40 fragments were produced, which were then fixed with \n\nN-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) to the plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle\u00ae, Bristol, \n\nUK)(Figure 6.b) and placed in the experimental tank, on 10 cm high platform (depth at \n\nwhich they received a PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1). Half of the fragments (n=20) \n\nwere fixed by their intact side and half by their cutted side. \n\nAlthough the experimental system was the same, it was only used the red spectra \n\ntank, because this spectra yielded the best results in previous experiments. The tank was \n\nequipped with 4 T5 fluorescent lamps Aqualine T5 Plant Grow (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, \n\nGermany) providing a PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1. A photoperiod of 12L: 12D was \n\nused.

Statistical \n\nanalyses were carried out using the Statistica 12.0 software. \n\n \n\n2.8 Water Parameters \n\n \n\nThe water parameters measured throughout the experiments on both systems, \n\nwere as follows: temperature at 25-27\u00b0C, pH at 8-8.4, salinity at 35, NH3 ? 0.1mg/L, \n\nNO2 ? 0.1 mg/L, NO3 ? 10 mg/L, Ca ? 400-420mg/L and KH at 7-10 dKH. Partial water \n\nchanges of approximately 10% of the total system volume were performed on weekly \n\nbasis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n2.9 Laboratorial analysis \n\n \n\n2.9.1 Fixation force \n\n \n\nThe fixation force (Newtons) was measured using a designed system (Figure 7) \n\nequipped with a digital dynamometer Kern FK10 (resolution of 0.005 N; bottom detection \n\nlimit of 0.01 N; upper detection limit of 10 N). The system works as a scale: a water \n\ndripping system fills the cup on the right arm, which steadily increases the pressure \n\nexerted on the fragment, once the fragment is dislodged from its substrate the \n\ndynamometer on the left arm records the fixation force.  \n\nIn order to calculate the value of the fixation force it was necessary to record the \n\nattaching area of each fragment, through the use of milimetric paper. After displacement \n\nof the fragment was, it was immediately placed over the milimetric paper, and the fixation \n\narea was outlined. Based on this boundary it was calculated de fixation area that was used \n\nto calculate de fixation force, through the following formula (Santos et al., 2005):  \n\n \n\n???????? ????? (\n?\n\n???\n) =  \n\n???????? ???????? ????? (?)\n\n???????? ???? (???)\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: The system used to measure the fixation force of the fragments. \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n2.9.2 Photosynthetic efficiency \n\n \n\nThrough Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry ((Schreiber et al., 1986) \n\nthe photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (PS II) was measured within the \n\nendosymbiotic Symbiodinium spp., by the end of each experiment. For that a Walz Junior \n\nPam (Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) (Rocha et al., 2013a) was used. Measuring actinic \n\nand saturating light was provided by a blue LED-lamp (peaking at 450 nm, half-\n\nbandwidth of 20 nm), that was delivered to the sample by a 1.5 mm-diameter plastic \n\nfiberoptics bundle. The fiberoptic was positioned perpendicularly to the surface of the \n\ncoral fragment, and all measurements were made at a fixed distance of 1 mm. \n\nMeasurements were carried out at the end of the experience, 2 h after the start of the \n\ndaylight period, to ensure the full activation of the photosynthetic apparatus. \n\nTo determine the maximum quantum yield of PSII, coral fragments were dark-\n\nadapted for 15 min, after which one saturation pulse (0.8 s) was applied to determine the \n\nminimum fluorescence, Fo, and the maximum fluorescence, Fm. Fo and Fm are then used \n\nto determine the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Schreiber et al., 1986), by the formula: \n\n??/?? = (\n?????\n\n??\n) \n\n \n\n3.

Discussion \n\n \n\n4.1 Post-fragmentation recommendations \n\n \n\nThe experiments with the higher stocking densities (2 and 3) were the experiments \n\nwere higher survival was observed and also the greater number of episodic releases of \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nmucus (data not shown). Mucus is proposed to be a defense mechanism of corals against \n\nenvironmental stressors, acting as a physical barrier and sloughing to avoid colonization \n\nby invasive microbes (Brown and Bythell, 2005; Bythell and Wild, 2011). These stocking \n\nhigh densities, can carry risks related to pathogen communicability, and virulence \n\n(Sheridan et al., 2013), increasing the incidence of diseases, thus, leading corals to \n\nincreasing the exudation of carbon assimilated by their zooxanthellae in the form of \n\nmucus (Davies, 1984). These episodic releases of mucus can, to some extent, be related \n\nto the higher survival registered, possibly serving as an indicator of coral stress in \n\nresponse to environment. \n\nFragments at this stage of post-fragmentation are more vulnerable to suffer \n\nnecrosis, possibly by the microbiological contamination of the damaged tissues. \n\nMaintenance of high water quality, adequate inorganic nutrient supply and the use of UV \n\nfilters are good practices to minimize coral survival in production. \n\n \n\n4.2 PAR intensity \n\n  \n\nThe survival recorded was not significantly different between the PAR intensities \n\nstudied (Experiment 2). Similar to our work, Sella and Benayahu (2010) found no \n\nsignificant differences in survival between 35 and 130 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 in \n\nSarcophyton sp. fragments cultured ex situ, but observed that extreme light PAR \n\nintensities (20 and 250 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1) triggered higher survival rates. All these \n\nevidences suggest that Sarcophyton sp. has an interval of tolerance to PAR intensity \n\nsomewhere between these PAR values. Furthermore, we found that PAR intensity \n\npositively influenced fixation ratio and fixation force, with PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 \n\ns?1 yielding the best results. Our conclusion is that Sarcophyton sp. fragments have a \n\nbetter post-fragmentation performance under higher PAR intensities, within their \n\ntolerance range. An analogue phenomenon, known as light enhanced calcification, is well \n\ndocumented in scleractinian corals, for which an increase in light intensity within the \n\ntolerance values of the coral leads to an increase in growth/calcification (Al-Horani et al., \n\n2003; Huston, 1985; Meesters et al., 1994; Muller-Parker and D\u2019Elia, 1997; Schutter et \n\nal., 2008). \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nIn the face of these results, the PAR 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 was stablished as \n\nthe best PAR intensity value to improve the performance of Sarcophyton sp. fragments \n\npost-fragmentation. \n\n \n\nA gradual light acclimatization should be performed in order to increase survival \n\n(Sella and Benayahu, 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 Spectra \n\n \n\nNot all wavelengths are used equally by the different zooxanthellate coral species, \n\nwhich is related with ecophysiological differences among coral and symbiont species  \n\n(Iglesiasprieto and Trench, 1994), and with selective absorption of visible light by \n\nseawater (Mass et al., 2010). By comparing the action spectra of zooxanthellae \n\nphotosynthetic pigments with the wavelength emission of the white light treatment, it was \n\nobserved an overlap in the 420-480nm range, but little in the wavelengths of 550 and 600, \n\ncorrespondent to green and yellow respectively, where the white light treatment has peaks \n\nof emission. Zooxanthella photosynthetic pigments can perform photosynthesis in the \n\nspectral range of light between 400 and 700 nm, the so called Photosynthetically Active \n\nRadiation (PAR) (Lalli and Parsons, 1997). However, maximum rates of photosynthesis \n\nare observed in the wavelength ranges of 400-550 nm (violet, blue) and 620-700 nm (red) \n\n(see Figure 5d, (Lalli and Parsons, 1997), as observed by Rocha et al., (2013) for the \n\nphotosynthetic pigments of Sarcophyton cf. glaucum zooxanthella. Possibly this previous \n\nevidence can explain the high survival of 60% (although no statistical significant) \n\nobserved under the white spectra treatment. A similar finding was reported in one study \n\nthat found that Sarcophyton sp. exhibits lower growth rates under T8 fluorescent lamps \n\n(control group), which have a similar wavelength emission as our white light treatment \n\n(Fernandes et al., 2014). \n\nIn this study, red light spectra compared to blue and white spectra yielded the \n\noverall best results regarding survival, fixation ratio and fixation force. Through the \n\nanalysis of the wavelength emission of red and blue light treatment (Figure 4) it was \n\nobserved that all light treatments had emissions on the blue wavelength range, but only \n\nthe red light treatment exhibited emissions of low energy red light. We can therefore \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\ntheorize that red light may be an important sensory cue (Kinzie III et al., 1984) with a \n\nphotophysiological enhancement effect on Sarcophyton sp. performance, which is \n\nplausible considering that these are shallow water corals (McFadden et al., 2006a), \n\nnormally exposed to full PAR spectra in their natural habitats (Dustan, 1982). Due to the \n\npresence of some high energy blue light in the red treatments it is not clear whether red \n\nlight has a photophysiological enhancement effect per se or if acts in combination with \n\nblue light. Antagonistic effect was found by Wijgerde et al. (2014), who found that red \n\nlight represses photophysiologically the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata, a coral \n\nwith a deeper vertical range of distribution. Similarly, Rocha et al. (2013b) found that \n\nblue light promotes high growth performances in the Acropora formosa and Stylophora \n\npistillata. Our analogue studies suggest that corals are chromatically adapted to their \n\nsurrounding light environment, which can be explained by the minimum light \n\nrequirements related the spectral quality of the light exhibited by the zooxanthellae (Mass \n\net al., 2010). Furthermore they show how highly species-specific the effects of spectra \n\ncan be, and highlights the need for species-specific light optimization (Wijgerde and \n\nLaterveer, 2013). \n\nThe overall Fv/Fm results did not exhibit significant between treatments in any of the \n\nexperiment employed, being generally high and close to the maximum values reported in \n\nthe literature for corals (Kuguru et al., 2010; Levy et al., 2003; Rocha et al., 2013c; \n\nWinters et al., 2009, 2006). These results indicate that our fragments physiologically \n\nhealthy under all light treatments tested, depicting the remarkable flexibility and \n\nadaptability of these symbionts (Apprill et al., 2007; Gorbunov et al., 2001; Iluz and \n\nDubinsky, 2015; Robison and Warner, 2006; Titlyanov et al., 2001). \n\nScleractinian corals are known to undergo a dynamic resource management to \n\nrepair damaged tissues, maintaining the integral structure of the colony (Nagelkerken et \n\nal., 1999; Van Woesik and Jord\u00e1n-Garza, 2011). This healing process happens at the \n\nexpense of growth and reproduction (Meesters et al., 1994; Ward et al., 2002; Weil et al., \n\n2009). These energy trade-offs are even more complex considering that corals are clonal \n\norganisms that rely on zooxanthellae for energy (Van Woesik and Jord\u00e1n-Garza, 2011).  \n\nAlthough this phenomenon is not well understood in octocoralles, it is possible that the \n\nfragments had to allocate resources to repair the damaged tissues after fragmentation, \n\nrelying on zooxanthellae to keep a positive energy balance for colony maintenance. We \n\nspeculate this light related post-fragmentation performance, after observing that the main \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nfactors affecting survival and fragment fixation identified during the course of the study \n\nwere light related parameters (spectra and PAR intensity). \n\n \n\n4.4 Substrate \n\n \n\nSubstrate type had no influence on survival, fixation ratio, fixation force or \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency in neither of the experiments undertaken. A similar study \n\ncorroborate these results (Schlacher et al., 2007). It is suggested that the performance of \n\nfragments post-fragmentation do not depend on the substrate type but rather on the \n\nsubstrate durability (Ferse, 2010). Therefore, the plastic stands were chosen as standard \n\nsubstrate type for further coral fragmentation cultures, due to its higher cost-effectiveness. \n\nCalcium carbonate stands are, on the other hand, more time consuming and require \n\nspecialized machinery to be prepared. \n\n \n\n4.5 Fixation process \n\n \n\nRegarding the fixation process, N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) and \n\nEthylcyanoacrylate (Superglue), under red light, both promoted the highest fixation force \n\nof all treatments. However, since N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) performed better \n\nthan Ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue) in terms of fixation ratio, it was chosen as standard \n\nmethod for further fragmentation procedures. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fragment position \n\n \n\nFragment position had no influence in any of the parameters evaluated.  As such, \n\nfragments can be secured to the substrate with no special considerations regarding their \n\nposition, increasing the efficiency of the procedure, thus reducing the costs of manpower. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n5. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe designed experimental approach was important to identify optimum post-\n\nfragmentation conditions in Sarcophyton sp.. It was concluded that the post-\n\nfragmentation performance of Sarcophyton sp. fragments in ex situ culture systems was \n\nmainly dependent on the artificial lighting regimes used. Therefore, the light spectral \n\ncharacteristics represents a vital component of photoacclimation that should be \n\nconsidered especially during this critical period. This study provided evidence that:  \n\n(1) Spectra plays an important role on the survival, fixation ratio and fixation force \n\nof Sarcophyton sp. fragments post-fragmentation, with red light spectra achieving better \n\nresults;  \n\n(2) Under the tolerance levels of Sarcophyton sp. holobiont, higher PAR \n\nintensities yield the best results for fixation ratio and fixation force, is this case PAR of \n\n120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1; (3) The performance of the fragments was similar for fragments \n\ngrafted onto calcium carbonate disks or plastic stands;  \n\n(4) Fragment position had no influence in the success of fragmentation. Logically, \n\nthese conditions have to be coupled with aquaculture best practices, such as the \n\nmaintenance of top water quality throughout the growth out procedure. \n\nGiven the continued popularity of corals and the negative impacts caused by their \n\nharvest from the wild, aquaculture assumes a leading role towards the sustainable use of \n\nmarine resources by optimizing the current employed techniques for coral production. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAl-Horani, F. a, Al-Moghrabi, S.M., De Beer, D., 2003.
